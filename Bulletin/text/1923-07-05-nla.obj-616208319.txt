He dwelt familiar with the gods of old
And roamed light-hearted among woodland

To bind his brows with many woven

And hear Apollo touch his harp of gold
To sorceries of music manifold.
He felt the growth and grandeur of his
powers
And delved for Truth while splendors fell
in showers,.
Then, tortured, fled a world gone crass and
cold.
The pure embodiment of Shakspeare’s most
Poetic mood, he is a faery sprite
That wings .his way above the baffled host

ARTHUR ALBERT BAYLDON.
Athens in Literary History
; When Columbus in 141)2 sailed across the
Western ocean, and Luther in 1517 nailed
his 95 theses to the church door at Witten-
berg, a double movement began which re-
opened the closed gates of the past and
made modefp thought possible. Its first
great showing was in the outburst of song
which flooded the days of Elizabeth and
domes I. The widening of the world with-
out as well Us of thelivorld within lifted the
great achievements of a pagan :ge into a
place of true honor, till a desire to imitate
and emulate them strengthened into great
literary deeds, It was not that Columbus
had a very strong feeling for adventure or
that Luther had any remarkable vision or
breadth of outlook. Both were essentially
i antipathetic to the new age they created.
They were like the first founders of cannon,
| who little Mint that the weapons they
'made for kings''won Id soon thunder down all
•the despot thrones of the world. But the
[new age came "on in spite of them. Men in
jthe crooked, dirty and illiterate cities of
(Britain re-discovered ancient Itome, a Rome
iwhich seemed straight, clean and filled with
jit; hitherto Undreamt-of culture. One step
jfarther, and they discovered that Athens had
:taught Rome most of the things it knew.
jTiiere was, of course, the Italian Renaissance
;is a stepping-stone to all this; but its effect
fiui England bad been comparatively slight.
Chaucer is too much a native product, too
{splendidly ignorant of the past and too
jvividly alive in the present, to be other than
’the lone star of our early morning, herald-
ing a sunrise, but reflecting no lights of any
.past sunset. Wyatt and Surrey represent
about the extent of the immediate effect
produced by the Italian writers on the
North; and it would probably not be too
much to say that the great Elizabethans
found the Italians through the Latins and
Creeks rather than the Latins and Greeks
through the Italians. Even the Queen was
a Greek scholar, though she probably knew
more of the New Testament in the original
than of Plato. The English revival of letters
was a great native impulse which, patching
a spark from the past, blazed out into a
splendor that even the past may not have
known. The qualifying “may” is necessary
because of the lost books. We judge Sappho
on a few fragments and Sophocles on seven
out of 130 plays.
But the Athenian splendor from which the
English glory caught its first fire is itself
put in an entirely new light by the dis-
coveries of Evans in Crete. The beginnings
o' Athenian culture are very like the begin-
mgs of English : the Persian war gave the
Seine impetus in Attica as the so-called Re-
formation and the age of adventure gave
fn England. Leaving out the mysterious
Homer and the fragmentary Sappho—voices
from a remote and at present rather incom-
prehensible past—almost the only great writer
before the war is JEsehylus, but his first
prize for tragedy was won in the lull be-
tween Marathon and Salamis. It was when
the Athenians, working in a spirit of ardent
nationalism, had re-built their walls and
restored their State, that there arose in a
single age Sophocles, Euripides, Socrates
and Mato, with Aristophanes to make clever
and coarse mirth for the mob out of all
that the greater minds of the time were
achieving. Except for a single singer of
the Alexandrine age the after-literature of
Greece runs to thin elaboration; no new
impulse comes along. There is only the
Latin echo —in Virgil’s ease an echo all but
as wonderful as the original sound.
Phe very brevity of the Athenian rise to
tull expression looks like a world tragedy.
Our Shakspeare has a Milton to succeed
him, our Milton a Coleridge, our Coleridge
a Keats; but after Euripides—long after,
in a distant land'—there is only the soft
feed-piping of Theocritus and 'a mob of
talkative but ineffective Hellenists in Alex-
andria and Constantinople. But if all that
Athens did is only a renaissance of things
fjone long before in Crete, a lot, of the seem-
ing tragedy disappears. We are left wonder-
ing about Homer, Sappho and the demi-god
poet Orpheus. Some of the works of
Qrfrheus were actually extant until mangled
out of recognition by Christian enthusiasts
in : Alexandria; and much of Sappho was
known to the Athenians and Romans. Flow
many forgotten singers lived in that old
green Cretan world V llow far were the
great Athenians imitators of a still greater
past?
-Phe consideration throws some doubt upon
the commonplace view which has grown so
stale by frequent repetition that the Greeks
struck out a, marvellous patli for themselves.
Strictly such a view was never possible about
any but a very small handful of poets,
artists, philosophers and historians. The
spirit of Greece was too much for those
find their impulse did not affect the future.
The Greek of history is very gloomy, very
cruel, very fickle and only in a single age—
the age of great literary effort—very cour-
ageous. It would seem as if a few men in
Athens triumphed over the deffd weight of
the popular Hellenism and—possibly reflect-
ing lights of a remote past—made a pass-
ing brilliance between the lost and the com-
ing glory.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Shock Nurse
A group photograph which contains Sister
It. A. Kirkcaldie, writer of In Grey and
Scarlet (Alexander McCubbin), presents her
as a nice-looking and essentially feminine
girl of a type which is to be seen at any
Australian dance or tennis-party. And that,
evidently, is what she is—on one side of
her. By a providential dispensation of
Nature this variety of young woman is occa-
sionally capable of summoniug-up amazing re-
serves of stolid fortitude and cool courage
when faced with the exigencies’ of a big
job; and then the world gets that invaluable
product, the perfect nurse. Sister Kirk-
caldie had just completed her four years’
training at Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,
when the World War began ; she volunteered
for Australia’s first hospital ship, the Gran-
tala, and was accepted. Failing to get into
the Australian nursing service after Rabaul,
she went to London and enlisted there.
She was at Malta when the wounded began
to arrive from Gallipoli:
At‘first they came in ones and twos, still clad
in their khaki uniforms, blood-stained and mud-
stained, the dirt of ages begrimed on their faces
and hands. There were men with burns and flesh
wounds beginning on the crown of their heads and
finishing on the soles of their feet; men with limb-
off ; others, less fortunate, with limbs shat-
tered beyond repair, each movement of which
caused them torture; there were men shot through
the abdomen; men shot through the chest; men
scarred with ugly bayonet wounds; men with burns
from bursting shells covering. most of their bodies
and limbs.
Whcu the Somme battles began in July,
1916, she was on a Channel hospital ship;
For the first few weeks the strain was terrific.
Unceasingly we crossed and re-crossed. . Day and
night became the same to us. Many times we
worked for -24 hours at a stretch ; then, after a~
brief rest, began once again long hours of furious
work and tension. Anything was liable to happen
among men wounded like these. Ihemorrhages were
frequent; deaths often occurred among the suffer-
ing “minor” cases. Walking cases frequently had
to be labelled with an “all-red ticket,” which to
the initiated meant “Dangerously ill. To go to
the nearest hospital.” In every branch of our work
the strain was continuous and intense.
The great Arras offensive found her at a
C.C.S.:
It, was about 5 a.m. when the barrage opened,
and very soon after we were in our wards 5 waiting
expectantly. We did not have long to wait. Before
7 the -first ambulance came down the road, to ns,
and, _as the day advanced, they poured in in aii
ever-increasing' stream. We commenced to know
work as' we had never known it, and to face sights
the tragedy of which no >vorcls : can tell. .. . My ward
was allotted to penetrating chest wounds and spine
cases. Soon —far, far too soon—the 2(5 beds wore
filled and still more came. These had to be left
lying on their stretchers, and the stretchers were
•squeezed in wherever there was floor space. That
little ward of agony stands clearly before me now.
The beds were filled with men coughing, struggling
and gasping for breath. By using many pillows we
kept them well propped up in bed, and this made
easier their agonising task of breathing. Blit for
the poor souls lying on stretchers it was impossible
to do the same. Before 11 o’clock the ward was
crowded out, and r.o more patients could possibly be
admitted until the congestion was relieved. An
ambulance train waited close by to carry those fit
to travel to the base. “Fit to travel!” AVe looked
round the ward, and then at one another. There was
hot one man there fit to travel. But the need for
room was too urgent to be ignored. With heavy
hearts eve began our sorrowful task of deciding who
were to go and who to stay. The doctor soon reduced
it to a formula. All the men whose pulses could
be felt would have to g 0.... And while all this
went on men were dying, men were hemorrhaging,
and still more men were streaming in to fill the
beds just emptied.
No shock troops are given half as many
opportunities to learn the inner meaning of
warfare as shock nurses get. Generals see
few of the grim realities that face these
women every day a battle for a . few yards
of mud occurs; and as for the politicians
and munition-makers who do most to make
and prolong wars, they are as far removed
from the conditions with which C.C.S. and
hospital-ship nurses struggle as they would be
if such horrors belonged to another century.
The League of Nations might do an eminent
service to the cause of peace if, with an eye
to the next world war, it persuaded the
Powers to introduce a common law to their
Constitutions, designed to force those who
have most to do with wars to learn some-
thing of what war is. Under such a law
statesmen and captains of industry would be
required to put in at least 24 consecutive
hours in every month, while their country
was at war, watching the proceedings at
C.C.S.’s and base hospitals when the wounded
were coming in after an advance. This
would enable them to envisage the unimagin-
able ; and since they are probably as kind-
hearted as any other class, the effect ought
to be to make them advocates of peace at
any reasonable price. Unimaginativeness
and unreasonableness in high places were,
after all, the real causes of the infamies
with which “In Grey and Scarlet” deals.
Sister Kirkcaldie did not rush her book
before the public. In that she did well, too
—if not from the point of sales, at least, in
the interests of the men she and a hundred
thousand other women served so splendidly.
The public, we are told, is “tired of the war.”
It wants to forget. But it must not be
allowed to foi’get. When it forgets the war
it will forget its obligations and responsibili-
ties to the men who fought the war. Such
sharp reminders as this of what the fighting
meant are thus calculated to do a great ser-
vice to those who too often now are com-
pelled to nurse their wounds and their thou-
sand and one disabilities amid public indiffer-
ence and neglect.
JOHN POLDING.
An Old Standing Army
They were a curiously frank and unso-
phisticated lot, those Old Testament writers.
No cat, proclaiming its prejudices against
the rival cat on the back wall at dusk, is
more open in its likes and dislikes. Thus
Ahab, King of Israel, stands out, apart from
tin' transaction about Naboth’s vineyard, in
which he was not the real criminal, as a
gallant soldier and a stainless but rather
hesitating gentleman. In their frenzy the
priests and prophets, many of them' from
the decayed and disgruntled southern king-
dom of Jerusalem, who swarmed over the
land, wrote that he “did evil in the sight of
the Lord above all that were before him,”
but they lacked the ingenuity to invent some-

You can rely on the fact that
Burroughs Machines are built with
scientific exactness for long, hard use,
according to standards that in 38 years of
Burroughs history have never been lowered
or violated. Some of the original Burroughs
Adding Machines are in daily use at the
present time. This standard of long service,
Burroughs intends to maintain.
You can rely on the Burroughs you

DAVID JONES, opp. G.P.0., SYDNEY.
thing that he really did. _ The same frantic
traders in superlatives said of Ahab’s great
father, Omri, that lie “did worse than all
that were before him” ; yet they fished in the
troubled waters of politics, and laid no con-
crete charged against Omri. Every Israel-
itish monarch was a swine of the deepest dye
to those Jew writers whose cattish writings
have survived, because he refused to sub-
scribe to their doctrine that their city of
Jerusalem was the spiritual capital of the
world, and that no one could pray properly
unless he went there at his own cost, and
contributed to the upkeep of the priests and
prophets who swarmed in the locality. And
the house of Omri was especially murky, be-
cause it once almost looked like rebuilding
the empire which David built and which
Solomon let slip, only with Samaria instead
of Jerusalem as the capital.
David, the one Hebrew sovereign with a
standing army that can be identified, was, on
the other hand, the spoiled darling, of the
priestly writers. Yet while they insisted on
his goodness, just as they did on Ahab’s bad-
ness, they took no great trouble to make out
a case for him. He was a fairly numerous
bigamist, unlike Ahab, who seems to have
answered to Paul’s definition of a bishop, be-
ing “the husband of one wife.” He was a
brigand chief, and he entered the service of
the national enemy against his father-in-law.
He was a stern, if not an utterly brutal, con-
queror, and had the giddy ambition of a
small Hannibal. He embezzled the complai-
sant wife of one of his officers, and had the
officer killed to avert divorce proceedings in
the case of Uriah v. Batlisheba, David co-
respondent. He disinherited his elder sons
to make room for the son of the approach-
able woman. He altered the law or habit
by which the Assembly of the Tribes decided
on the new ruler, and rushed young Solomon
on to the throne as an hereditary prince,
which event had disastrous consequences
when the next man of the line, Rehoboam
Solomonson, came on the troubled scene. In
his old age David became morose and blanky.
He did a great hanging of the descendants
of his father-in-law and predecessor* and left
the bodies dangling indefinitely in the sun,
while a distracted mother sat underneath
and scared away the crows. This made it
fairly certain that the older royal family
wouldn’t reappear, and get in the way of
the son of the off-hand woman. He amused
himself by digging up and dragging about
the bones of his father-in-law and predeces-
sor, Saul, and his brother-in-law Jonathan.
And he died at a considerable age, not pic-
turesquely in battle like Saul and Ahad, but
stuffily in his bunk, with his latest flapper
wife hopping attendance on him. His final
directions were that his son and successor
should murder his best but rather unscrupu-
lous general, who was now old and hardly
worth keeping.
But this vigorous monarch gave Palestine
a capital, not built by him, but stolen ready-
made. There the priests were furnished, by
him and his son, with a permanent establish-
ment, with homes, a great cathedral and a
revenue-collecting or tribute-raising appa-
ratus which, despite disturbances by Jero-
boam, Nebuchadnezzar and others, was still
raising the wind in the days of Titus. Pre-
viously they seem to have been mere foot-
sore vagrants, picking up a living as they
best could. In gratitude they did their best
with David’s biography, and put more giants
in it than are in all the rest of the Scriptures.
David’s standing army of “Cherethites and
Pelethites” was a necessary institution for a
king who went empire-building on a big
scale —big considering the meagre size and
resources of his homeland. The tumultuous
levy of farmers might be fairly good for a
one-day campaign, but it wanted to get home
on the morrow to see how the potato-crop
was, and whether the wallabies were in the
corn. For large permanent annexing and
plundering jobs it had no more value than
a tribal force of Scottish Highlanders, the
race which spent a thousand years in bril-
liant fighting and gained nothing. The stand-
ing army was naturally camped in the con-
quered lands of Syria and thereabouts, to
sit on the embittered inhabitants and collect
from them. Out of this position grew a
scrap of history. Absalom (said to have
been about the best hair-restorer advertise-
ment in history) realised that he was in a
fair way to be set aside to make room on
the throne for the son of Bathsheba, the
obliging woman. When he started his in-
surrection the 12 tribes were so much of his
opinion that the king fell back across th°
Jordan, on his way to link up with his stand-
ing army of mercenaries, and hardly had
enough followers with him to make a quorum.
Ahithophel, the wise counsellor of a foolish
master, urged the insurrectionary prince to
rush the campaign with such farmers as he
had got together. But the prince was evi-
dently a previous incarnation or back-shadow
of Monmouth, to whom he bequeathed his
name and his bad luck. Hushai, the traitor-
ous counsellor, beguiled him to wait till he
got nil the disordered farmers together. This
he did, knowing that the mercenaries, dressed
in seven-league hoots, were hurrying down
from Syria, and when they got on the scene
it wouldn’t matter though all the agricul-
tural, pastoral, poultry-raising and bee-keep-
ing interests of Israel were in Absalom’s
camp. The real fighting appears to have
lasted some minutes, and it ended in a very
dead Absalom. Ahithophel got ahead of
trouble by hanging himself in the coalshed
with the strap off his cabin-trunk.
Other Hebrew armies are described, chiefly
in the wild record of 11. Chronicles. Reho-
boam, lord of much the smaller of two
kingdoms which measured some 12,000 square
miles put together, raised 180,000 soldiers
once. His successor collected 400,000 Jews
to fight against 800,000 Israelites, and killed
500,000 of them right off. The next Jew
king mustered 550.000 troops out of an area
one day’s cab-ride across. Jehoshaphat (No.
4 monarch) was, however, the really dazzling
apparition. He kept on foot, or on paper,
five armies mustering 1,160,000, “mighty men
of valor,” mere trash having been weeded out.
All these “waited on the king” in the big hill
village of Jerusalem, the provincial garri-
sons being extra. What they waited for is
not certain, but never were there such doings
in Tasmania, though it is twice the size of
both Judah and Israel. But these stupen-
dous forces did no appreciable conquering.
In fact, they seemed to dissolve away in time
of trouble, and when the land was invaded
by some little tribe like the Moabites or the
Reehabites or the Jacobites or the Mosquito-
bites, the monarch could only take refuge in
sackcloth and prophecy. David’s army, on
the other hand, was apparently very real.
JAMES EDMOND.
Edgar Saltus
Edgar Saltus was boi'n in New York in
1858, and died, I believe, in the same city
last year. He wrote over 20 books, novels,
philosophical essays and literary and histori-
cal studies, and it js doubtful if the Sov-
ereign Pontiffs of criticism, who discover
that a genius has a future after he has been
dead long enough to attain classic antiquity,
could quote more than a couple of the titles
offhand. Yet this obscure, untrumpeted
American was one of the world’s masters of
prose. He wrote as wittily as Wilde ; many
of his passages are as good as Pater’s, and
he had much of Pater’s cold frenzy for style,
though he never made the Oxford aesthete’s
mistake of regarding literature as an occult
science.
I first came across Saltus in a quotation
from an essay on Gautier, preceding a little
volume called “Tales Before Supper,” and,
after the rare pleasure of reading the out-
wardly simple but inveigling English, I tried
to get other books by him. But it was a
heartbreaking effort. Nearly all of his works
are out of print, and second-hand „shops now
yield poor results to the increasing swarm
of appreciative students who have been fas-
cinated by his prose. The extraordinary
thing is that he was so neglected by his con-
temporaries. Among numerous works on
American literature quoted by the capable Carl
van Vechten he is mentioned cursorily about
twice, and Plolbrook Jackson merely alludes
to him in his “The Eighteen Nineties.” Yet
he and his brother Francis, who was a poet,
were well acquainted with James Huneker,
as the latter bears witness in his autobio-
graphy, “Steeplejack.” Huneker drank with
the Saltuses, Ambrose Bierce and other
literary cronies at one of New York’s few
really Bohemian cafds; but he, who had a
nose for talents and hunted them down to
catalogue their psychological complexities,
didn’t notice anything resplendent about the
unassuming cosmopolite behind the aperitif
opposite. Too absorbed in the skyscrapers
abroad, he did not observe that the edifice
next door soared magnificently. It is stranger
still that Mencken has little, if anything, to
say about Saltus either. But, then, Mencken
has been wheeling up big Berthas for modern
game, and Saltus may have too much of the
feminine delicacy of pomade to appeal to his
robust taste. There is certainly a hint of
the Yellow Book about some of Saltus’s tales.
In a couple of his earlier novels one notices
the pale phantom of the bon mot in the bon-
bon kind of literature, and phrases are pro-
fusely curled and scented; but one forgets
those things in ready recognition of the
whole exquisite achievement. Take him by
and large, he was a great craftsman for
whom our difficult language performed pro-
digies of expression.
His finest opus is his “Imperial Purple,” a
study of the Csesars, probably owing some-
thing to his reading stealthy, subterranean
meanings into the small talk of Lampridius,
Suetonius and contemporary Roman gos-
sipers, but standing to the grave and decor-
ous Gibbon as a miniature stands to Winter-
halter. No one can follow this parade of
beasts, idlers and worse, who invented in-
famies only to reveal that they were the
apparitions of cast-off sins, without feeling
that the period is alive before you. The ban-
quets, the bugles, the hot breath and blood
of the circus, the posturing, the blasphemies
and brutalities, the childish exaltation of the
trite and preposterous, the triumph of id'ot
lusts that had their own etiquette end cere-
monial are there in picture upon picture, and
every monster and his passion are drawn
true to scale. You see Julius Caesar in the
streets “alive with explosions of brass,
aflame with the burning red cloaks of lau-
relled lictors. Four horses harnessed abreast,
their manes dyed, their forelocks puffed, drew
a high and wonderfully-jewelled car; and
there in the attributes and attitude of
Jupiter Capitolinus” the despot sat, “blink-
ing his tired eyes.” Then we have Augus-
tus, “an emperor in everything but dignity,”
who exiled his daughter “not because she had
lovers, but because she had other lovers than
himself.” Tiberius slinks from behind the cur-
tain of the Past, meditating on the divorce
from his wife because she did not adore him
sufficiently. Caligula foams into view. “He
tipped a coachman a million, rained on the
people a hail of coin, bathed in essences, set
before his guests loaves of silver, gold
omelettes, sausages of gems; sailed to the
hum of harps on a ship that had
porticoes, gardens, baths, bowers, spangled
sails and a jewelled prow.” He spent
£400,000,000 of our money in a year, and
was more striking than Nero, whose tyrannies
look passe beside the other’s bloated offences.
Nero was. a demon, but one thinker has
absolved him from the wickedness of killing
his mother on the ground that she deserved
her punishment in giving him birth. Lastly
we come to Pleliogabalus, who tried to add
another octave to the gamut of sensations.
History is prone to lift her dirty skirts from
contamination with this fellow, before whose
incalculable iniquities even Saltus’s pen
grows a little timorous.
“Imperial Purple” is a masterpiece. The
carefully polished sentences are . splendidly
turned, each one resolute and exact as a sol-
dier, each moving to a rhythm that mingles
the rapidity of the quickstep with the court-
liness of the minuet, and never faltering in
its consuming ambition of holding eye and
ear with its marbled elegance. Wandering
through Saltus’s “Mary Magdalen,” a tale
that sharpens the memory of something pre-
viously done better by Flaubert, you see him
deftly laying the foundations of his style.
The scaffolding is visible in his religious
speculations, “Lords of the Ghostland,” and
his astonishing “Historia Amoris,” in which
Sappho, Cleopatra, Heloise, Helen of Troy
and others are raised from the dead and set
gracefully in motion. He is nearly up to
the top floor in “The Pomps of Satan,” but
is less supple in his unnecessary devotion to
Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann in “The
Philosophy of Disenchantment.” Herein, de-
spite an appearance of lucidity and cunning
in the choice of words, he is puffing heavily
on the trail of a metaphysic that provokingly
eludes him. But he is au fait with the
religions. He is familiar enough to knock
them down without apology for his imper-
tmenee. The Anatomy of Negation” ought
not to be distributed broadcast. The senten-
tiousness and wicked wit are hardly paralleled
by the glittering effects he got into his prose
elsewhere.
His full name was Edgar Evertson Saltus.
He derived the Evertson from a progenitor
Admiral Cornells Evertson, the valiant Dutch
sailor who wrested New York from the Eng-
lish in 1673.

A Satchel of Books
The Bright Shawl, by Joseph Hergesheimer (Heine-
mann). A story of Cuba under the Spanish domina-
tion, more significant of the Conrad influence than
anything that has previously come from the same
pe ?' A? e , A 1 * 1 ® is taken from the shawl worn by
a beautiful dancer, La Clavel, who is soon enmeshed
in Cuban schemes for independence, and finally
perishes after a terrific fight with a coarse Spanish
admirer. La Clavel is a typical Hergesheimer
creation a woman of a thousand graces and loyal-
ties who carries a slim dagger in her garter. Read
at a sitting, the book, with its dark violences and
exquisitely written suggestions of menace and fore-
boding, might almost be described as a superlatively-
colored nightmare.
Some Impressions of Mg Elders, by St. John G
Ervine. Herein Ervine discusses Wells, Shaw, Gals-
worthy, Bennett and other eminent people as men,
as writers and in relation to one another. He is
a penetrating critic and has not shrunk from saying
unpleasant things about hi s friends. An Ulsterman
of pronounced views, the eternal Irish question
continually pushes into his judgments of such men
as Belloc and A.E.”—the essay on the latter is
more . like a brilliant Morning Post leader than
anything else and he does best where his prejudices
are not engaged. His studies of Shaw and Wells
are masterpieces in their line.
Scissors, by Cecil Roberts (Heinemann). His
parents called him Narcissus, and then took him
to Amasia, in Asia Minor, where his father had a
job, and he grew up among young Turks. Then
as a lad, his mother having died, he was sent to
s® l ' ool }, n England; and there he became Scissors.
After that you get to the best part of a good,
healthy book—the story of the years at school and
of the vacations with school pals; then his father’s
death, his struggle to earn a living as a junior
master, his assault upon Fleet-street and (a push-
mg young man this) his success as a war corres-
pondent. And in and out is woven a sentimental
youth s love affair—to come a war-time crash which
drives him back to the country of his boyhood. A
sound story of normal youth, full of keen observation.
The Riddle of Unemployment, by Charles Edward
Pell (Cecil Palmer). Britain has had two million
unemployed, and all the economists are trying to
explain why, with a view, of course, to the preven-
tion of similar calamities. Mr. Pell’s explanation
is that the banks don’t know their business—the
banks in general and the Bank of England in par-
ticular. He refuses to admit that there is any such
thing as over-production. There are alwavs plenty
of people who want to buy; but they haven't the
money. It is at this point he arraigns the banks.
A feeling of optimism gains ground. Prices rise.
Merchants, manufacturers and others are making
money, and the banks begin to lend freely. Works
are enlarged, stocks are increased. That means more
money in circulation, and prices go still higher, and
wages also. Everybody is making more money than
ever; also advances and loans are larger than ever.
Then somebody begins to wonder how long it will
last; and the banks start to put on the screw. In
Britain, the Bank of England raises “the bank rate”
to a point at which borrowing is no longer profit-
able. Merchants have to reduce their stocks; the
manufacturer can’t sell his output; hands are dis-
charged ; earnings fall; at the very time when whole-
salers and retailers most want to sell the public
least wants to buy. And a slump is well on the way.
Mr. Pell’s cure is to stabilise prices .by issuing credit
in a direct ratio to the output of goods. When prices
began to rise above the normal he would put up the
bank rate and steady the movement; when they began
to fall he would check the movement by liberalising
the issue of credit. The bankers will probably reply
that only the fools among- them do anything else
now. Actually, no doubt, as money-makers them-
selves, they compromise, ministering to booms as
tar as they think they dare. In any case, Mr. Pell’s
observations and conclusions have little application
u Australia. In England if an incipient boom
showed itself in rising prices, the banks might be
able to steady unwarranted factory and stock expan-
sion by putting up the rate for accommodation. But
in Australia the principal agent of the boom is the
state; and the State is not deterred from borrowing
by the fact that the loan will not earn its interest.
So that here, at any rate, a boom will not be arrested
by putting up the rate of interest; and neither will
it in anv Other country where “nationalisation” is
extensively practised. It is not a pleasant conclu-
sion to reach: it means that in Australia a boom
can be almost indefinitely protracted; and in that
case toe payment must be all the more bitter, taking
the form, among others, of oppressive taxation to meet
unearned interest bills without shifting the load
of capital debt.
Polly; Ait Opera, by Mr. Gay (Heinemann) . Mr.
Gay got his “Beggar’s Opera” on the stage, but he
had less luck with its sequel. ' There had been a good
deal of hostile criticism of the earlier work: did it
not hold up the highwayman and the light-o’-love for
admiration ? So when the Lord Chamberlain heard
that Mr Gay had been at it again he sent an order
to prohibit Mr. Rich to suffer any Play to be
rehears’d upon his stage till it had been first of ail
supervis d by His Grace.” Then the fat was in the
fare; His Grace (or someone) read, was virtuously
indignant and forbade the production. It really isn’t
very surprising. Mr. Gay, recognising whence the
blows had come over his earlier opera, had hit back,
mercilessly satirising the little weaknesses of the
Loid Chamberlain’s fashionable friends. Now it was
his turn to be virtuously indignant. He not only-
set to work to publish the play, but printed with it
a Preface, dated March 25, 1725, in which he pro-
tested that he was as “loyal a Subject, and as firmly
attached to the present happy Establishment, as any
ot those who have the greatest Places or Pensions” ;
and that his “only intention was to lash in general
the reigning and fashionable Vices, and to recommend
and set Virtue in as amiable a Light as I could ”
So he had sent Polly off to the West Indies in pur-
suit of her transported lover Mclleath, and landed her
at a, moment when that gay- dog, now disguised as
a nigger, was busy organising a little buccaneering
enterprise designed to seize the island and make him-
self monarch of it, with (alas!) a lady who wasn’t
Polly for his queen. But Mr. Ducat is the vehicle
for most of the satire with which Mr. Gay had a
“ lash the reigning and fashionable Vices”
of the England of that period. And Mrs. Trapes, who
had “a fresh cargo of ladies just arrived”—a cargo
noboby shall set eyes upon till vou have provided
your self ” Mrs. Trapes’s handling of Mr. Ducat is
delightful. _ Mr. Ducat had mentioned that no man
in the Indies enjoyed the necessaries of life in so
handsome a manner as he. Whereupon Mrs. Trapes:
“Whoever heard a man of fortune in England talk
of the necessaries of life ? Whether we can afford
it or no we must have superfluities. We never stint
our expence to our fortunes, but are miserable if we
do not live up to the Profuseness of our Neighbors.
If we could content ourselves with the necessaries
of life, no man alive need ever be dishonest. As to
Woman, now; why, look ye, Mr. Ducat, a man hath
what we may call every thing that is necessary' in
a wife.
So Mr. Ducat is brought to reason:
“As I have a good estate. Mrs. Trapes, I would will-
ingly run into every thing that is suitable to my
dignity and fortune.... In most of my expences I
run into the polite taste. I have a fine Library of
Books that I never read; I have a fine stable of horses
that I never ride; I build, I buy Plate, jewels,
pictures, or anything that is valuable and curious,
as your great Men do, merely out of Ostentation.
But indeed, I must own, I do still cohabit with my
wife.”
Though none of the little lyrics of “Polly” have
won the popularity of some of those of “The Beggar’s
Opera,” many of them are charming; and they all
have the closest relationship with the text. In this
handsome edition the music is provided; and the
book is illustrated with the characters in the costumes
designed for the current London production.

This gave me a strange content—
Ah, that was before you came,
And whispered that magic word
' That kindled this golden flame
Deep, deep in my vagrant heart.
Now fettered am I, alas!
Who walked with the wind as friend
Through miles of shaken grass.

Kinship.
The man who tramps the highway
With dream-dust in his eyes,
Who takes the open spaces
Singing to arching skies,
What though he be a tinker,
Or scarcely worth a pin,
I’d draw the cosy curtain,
I’d surely ask him in;
For he and I are brothers,
For lie and I are kin.
But he who taps the pavements,
Whom Beauty’s breath leaves cold,
Who only hears the tinkle
Of pocketsfull of gold,
I would not have his favors,
Though they were mine to win;
I would not toss him laughter,
I would not ask him in ;
For he is wise and worldly,
And we would not be kin.
Oh. my kin are the brown men,
The gypsies of the road,
The wanderers who welcome
The wild as their abode;
So long as they cry Beauty
And have a song to spin,
I’d surely draw the curtain.
And laughing ask them in ;
For they are of the earth-clan,
And earth and I are kin!

Chair-ridden.
Not matter for repining that the gods
Have raised you high and held you for
their own ;
The kings of earthly empires are but clods
Fashioned by men to fit an earthly throne;
But you are set to rule a w T orld alone,
Where heavy-footed mortal never plods,
Nor diggers of the graves turn down their
sods.
Yours are the highways these have never
known ;
Richer you are for riches left behind,
To those who bargain in this tinsel mart,
And know- of light, but vision not its beams.
Your world is God-created to your mind.
Held sacred to the wishes of your heart,
And peopled by the children of your dreams.

Peace in the Wood.
In this lone wood,
’Midst glittering leaf and fern and creamy
bud,
I listen to the melodies profound,
As a true lover should.
Fragrant the place
With unseen bloom, and with a floating grace
The bird-notes fall as an embroidered
theme
Through netted murmur-lace.
Hymn of the bees
Rifling the orchids in the lofty trees ;
The plash of water in a distant pool
Blown by a furtive breeze
Which low and high
Beats a quiet rhythm as it flutters by.
Sweeping the strings of harps invisible
Where branches touch the sky.
A whir of wings,
And through the melody a blue bird sings
A solo in this vast cathedral gloom,
And far the echo rings.
Oh, sweet and sweet—
Here will I stay and rest my weary feet,
Watching the dappled shadows on the
leaves
Brighten and fade and fleet!
Losing all pain,
As God’s own music soothes my heart and
brain,
And one with all—wind, blossom, bird and
tree—
Peace comes to me again.

COMMONSENSE AND THE DEFENCE
QUESTION.
T/ie most futile of the cluster of censure
motions lately aimed at the Federal Gov-
ernment was the one designed to embarrass
the Prime Minister on the defence question
before the Imperial Conference. There is
no secret about where Messrs. Anstey and
Maiiony stand in this matter. They want
Australia’s defence policy to be “formulated
on the floor of the House” in the forlorn
hope that Parliament may tell Bkuce to
tell Britain we have no defence policy at all.
At the worst, it is trusted that the pal-
triest possible scheme may be formulated
for submission to the Conference. The mil-
lennium, they claim, is px-actically here.
The workers of the world are ready to unite.
Let < Australia’s Prime Minister enjoy the
distinction of notifying the world that this
country is prepared to go one better than
Germany, which only disarmed under com-
pulsion ; than liussia, which preached dis-
armament and then raised an immense army ;
than China, which is in chaos because it
lacks a national army to preserve its integ-
rity and maintain internal order. The time
has come, say our Labor pacifists, for the
workers to stop talking about the Brother-
hood of Man and show they believe in it as
a matter of practical politics.
* * * *
“God’s saints are the ruin of God,”
observed a wise old Spaniard, who had
watched misguided idealism at work in many
parts of the world. Earnest men and women
strive to prohibit drink and gambling, and
only succeed in filling lock-ups with two-
up players and homes with pot-stills. Faced
with th.e ravages of venereal disease, their
principles allow them to do no more than
reprobate unchastity. If unchastity could
be preached or argued out of the world it
would have vanished centuries ago. But it
cannot; and so vice persists and diseases
spread—diseases that could be exterminated
by work along practical lines —and some of
the worst suflerers are innocent children and
virtuous wives. With similar obtuseness
Laborites of the Anstey type contend that
the spirit which has been drenching the
world with blood for ages can be quenched
now by a moral gesture. It is magnificent,
but it is not sense. The proletariat classes,
far from being ready to unite, without re-
gard to national, racial and religious pre-
judices, are divided. A fatal tendency to
be stampeded into faction rows is the badge
of all their tribe, white, black and yellow.
The only genuine internationalists that
exist to-day are those who never boast of
their internationalism—the great financiers,
the trusts (Beef, Oil, Pictures, etc.) and
the ruling dynasties. The King of Spain
visits England and is received in the circles
he frequents with enthusiasm : his subjects
who come here are scowled at by their
fellow-toilers as Dagoes. The reception
given in the latter quarter to Britishers is
not much more cordial, and the so-called
Pommies reciprocate in full any prejudices
shown against them. Even during the war,
when it might have been imagined that there
was fighting and to spare for all, Aus-
tralian and Imperial troops clashed first
with one another, and then individually and
collectively with the Yanks. The Roman
Catholic Marquess of Bute would smile at
the idea of a feud on religious grounds with
the Protestant Marquess of Londonderry,
yet the workers of many other cities besides
Belfast are irretrievably split on the sec-
tarian issue. And if religion does not in-
trude the proletariat may be relied on to
divide on some other issue. The unionists
draw aside from those they call scabs, and
the hatred that rages between the two sec-
tions is liable to take the form of violence
and even murder. And when the unionist
makes money he nearly always finds some
pretext to turn on his old associates. What
bitterer critic have the workers had than
W. M. Hughes? What bitterer critics has
Hughes than the workers? The proposi-
tion men like Anstey and Maiiony want
this country to accept is that Asiatic coolies,
who have never come under the influence of
either Christian or Communist propaganda,
and who. for the most part, would be men-
tally and educationally incapable of under-
standing such ideals if they did, are likely,
in the presence of a unique chance to be-
come rich, to display a lofty morality and
self-restraint which no large body of white
working men has ever displayed. White
members of the proletariat do not leave their
homes, their women-folk or even their week’s
wages unprotected in the vicinity of strange
whites; and yet the Labor politicians argue
that it is safe to leave Australia unprotected
in the vicinity of strange black and yellow
men.
* * * *
If it is not the objective of our new-style
Laborites to render Australia completely un-
protected, it is about time their constituents
pinned them down to exactly what their
party’s policy is in this connection. The
present position is that our army has been
so retrenched that it is no longer capable
of training a national force on modern lines ;
that the R.A.N. is a thing of the past as
a fighting unit; that at a time when every
Power, great and small, is concentrating on
aircraft, we are without a single effective
machine; and that we have no munitions
or the means of manufacturing them in
bulk. It is feasible for some countries to
shirk their defence obligations. Canada,
for example, which was quoted during the
debate in justification of the Labor attitude
towards defence, is protected geographically
as well as by the Monroe Doctrine. But
when an exposed country which is worth
taking cannot defend itself or induce someone
else to defend it, the same thing always hap-
pens. The people of the nation which wants
it begin to arrive (usually on some highly
moral pretext), and eventually take over the
business of governing it —also on lofty moral
grounds. That was what happened to Korea,
whose independence was announced by
Japan in 1894; which was simultaneously
occupied ; which was annexed in 1910 (two
years after an announcement by the Japan-
ese Government that it would not be an-
nexed) ; and whose inhabitants were mas-
sacred in March, 1919, for demanding their
independence. Egypt has been bandied be-
tween Turkey, France and Britain for about
a century on no sounder ethical grounds
than that the Egyptians are unable to fight.
Italy occupies Cyrcnaica and Tripolitana
because “they were in a state of disorder and
neglect,” and “were but a short distance from
the Italian coast.” France and Belgium
hold practically the whole of their colonial
possessions under similar titles, and Japan
is in Shantung and other parts of China
(where the inhabitants can do no more than
passively resist) on like pretexts. If it is
admitted that the people who would like to
have Australia are as much in need of rich
colonies as Germany was before the war,
and that no evidence exists that they are
more moral than Britain, France and the
rest of the colonising Powers which, with
the hearty approval of their workers, have
been occupying places in the sun for genera-
tions, it must also be admitted that the only
reason why we have not shared the fate of
Korea lies in the fact that Britain is a
more reliable suzerain than China. In other
words, Britain has been performing an in-
estimable service for us for many years, and
is still doing it. A crisis has arisen which
makes it necessary that this country should
do something on its own account to save it
from the fate prescribed for all undefended
countries that are productive and habitable.
Australia can commission its Prime Min-
ister to tell the Imperial Conference (1)
that we would rather risk the fate of Korea
than spend a shilling on defence; (2) that
we want the British taxpayers to pav for
our defence—not because we are insolvent,
hut because our principles forbid us to
deny the Brotherhood of Man dogma by
maintaining an army or navy; (3) that we
recognise the Brotherhood of Man to be a
dream, and are prepared accordingly to face
the practicalities of the international situa-
tion on an equitable basis. A self-respect-
ing white country should not have much diffi-
culty in coming to a decision on the subject.
NEW AUSTRALIA IN 1923.
The revolution isn’t exactly the whole cause
of the trouble. We have had revolutions
before ; in fact, we feel lonely without them.
But this one of 1922-23 is something extra,
and it keeps on getting us in the neck. Com-
ing on top of the drought, and the locusts,
and the h. c. of 1. and the low price of cattle,
it is the last straw.
We had eight months of it last year. Then
it fizzled out about Christmas time, and we
had a spell of peace for a couple of months.
But it wasn’t over; the rebels were only
getting their second wind and a fresh supply
of ammunition. Then at it they went again.
Of course, we gringos —foreigners—are reck-
oned to be neutrals and non-combatants, bar
a few of the boys, whose forefathers had
ignored the color-line. And we are neutrals;
but we have to pay the piper all the same.
Between them they have gathered up all our
horses and gear, and every time the troops
pass through they take toll of the cattle.
The stragglers, deserters and camp-followers
are the worst trial. They get away from
the main bodies in little mobs of 15 to 20,
raiding and terrorising whenever the odds are
ten to one in their favor. We have claimed
on the Government for protection and com-
pensation for damages, moral and material.
The Government says: “Sorry, it’s against
our orders that you are molested. What
else can we do? As for compensation, when
the country gets settled the claims will be
adjusted.” But I fear we’ll all be adjusted
and settled before then. We got afLer our
Consul, too, and asked him what about it—
why didn’t he do something? lie, being a
diplomat, gave us a diplomatic reply—-in
effect, that it served us right for coming to
such a country, and if we didn’t like it the
boats were still running. He added (P.S.)
that he would be pleased to make out pass-
ports for any that wanted to quit, but not
to rush him, as he was overworked just at
present.
Those who remember anything about the
New Australia expedition to Paraguay will
recognise Big Charlie, ringer of many a
shearing-shed. He was riding over to the
store to see if his name was good for a bag
of salt —if they had any. He was also hump-
ing a demijohn on the offchance. The old
mare he was on was the only piece of horse-
flesh the gangs had left him. He was jog-
ging along sedately, when he was roused
from his meditations by a shout of “Alto!”
Looking up with a start he found he had
bumped into a squad of looters, armed with
ugly-looking Mausers. So he altoed. Tv\ o
of the gang he recognised: one owed him
money (in normal times Charlie ran a small
store, but lie had been raided twice, so had
chucked it), the other owed him work.
“What you got in that demijuan?” demanded
the leading bandit. “Nothing,” said Charlie.
They proved it by dropping the bottle on
the ground to see if it would bounce. It
didn’t. “Dismount,” was the next order;
they were peeved at the gringo carting about
an empty demijohn. They proceeded to run
the rule over him, and annex his portable
property. _ “Take off that saddle,” ordered
boss-bandit; “gringos have no right to saddles
whilst patriots are riding hide to hide.”
“Take it off yourself,” snarled Charlie. A
poke in the ribs with the muzzle of a Mauser
made him more amenable to reason, and he
ungirthed and pitched it on the ground.
“Swap bridles,” said one of the men.
“Bueno” ; and a piece of raw hide took the
place of the good gear.. That was about all
they could get off the mare, unless they took
her hide. They might have had that, only
she was full of ticks and mangy. Then they
set about stripping her rider. Coat and boots
they annexed, and swapped hats. Charlie’s
was the worse for wear, but the one he got
in exchange was a verminous wreck. He
thanked his lucky stars he hadn’t changed his
shirt before he started, or they certainly
would have had that too. They took his
belt and looked at his pants. They, like his
shirt, were has-beens, so they let him keep
them ; but a bandit, whose wearing apparel
was fixed up with string, cut the but-
tons off. Then they rode away to look
for more gringos. Charlie took 10 minutes
off to do a little thinking. He also wished
the hound who had pinched the buttons had
left him the string. That is not an isolated
case. Every now and then word of a raid or
a hold-up is wirelessed over the colony, and
we all have the wind up properly.
Early one morning, while I was busy
making the porridge, a New Australian of
the second generation drifted in .with a bridle
over his arm and a hunted expression in his
eye. It appeared that he was a deputation
from the fellows at the Back Block end of
the colony. He had started out with the
moon on a mare, bareback (all saddles com-
mandeered). About half-way he spotted a
press-gang in the distance, so he let the old
mare go with a , spank and a blessing, and
dived into the monte with the bridle. He had
managed to dodge the gang by ploughing
through the long swamp, and here he was.
“Things can’t go on like this. Something’s
got to be done,” he exclaimed. “The Gov-
ernment won’t do anything, the Consul can’t,
so we’ll have to make a kick for ourselves.”
The idea, it seems, was to have a roll-up.
Well, Sunday arrived, but the meeting didn’t
come off—too many raiders about. A fort-
night later there was a bit of a lull. We
hadn’t seen the aeroplane, a rebel or a con-
scientious objector for a week. So we got
together and talked matters over. We talked
and talked; but got no for’arder. Nobody
could suggest anything that promised the
ghost of a hope. But a woman had pushed
herself in ; and she declined to shift, even
though the meeting was for “heads of fami-
lies” only. Away back from the time of
King Billy Lane the law was “Females
and dogs not admitted to meetings.” Then
the chairman struck a brilliant idea. “Gentle-
men and hem —er —others, as you all know,
Tempora mutantur. The law as to females
and dovs was quite all right in the times of
King Billy, but to-day, as you all know,
woman has secured her economic position in
the world, other tlmn in this one-eyed hole;
to-day woman is doing man’s work—at boy’s
w r ages. as you all know. It’s time we took
that law out of our statute-book.” A vote
was taken, and woman was emancipated in
New Australia. Then the chairman made a
bow to her, and informed her that her vote
would count the same as a man’s ; moreover,
any suggestions she liked to make would
receive due consideration.
But it wasn’t the lady who made the only
suggestion that was worth a peso. It was a
second-generation youth who did that.
“Let’s get back to the land of our
forefathers,” he said, and sat down.
There was only one comment. “As if we
wouldn’t have done it, if we could, years ago
without waiting for this blasted revolution
to push us! It’s lack of sense brought us
here; it’s lack of dollars keeps us.” And
then our First Emancipated VV oman spoke:
"My suggestion is that we write home and
ask the Northern Territory Government what
price the job lot of us, white and piebald.”
“That’s not a bad idea,” said the chairman.
But just then a lad put his head in at the
door and yelled “Aeroplane,” and the meet-
ing rose as one man and one woman and
went out to gape at it.
So we left the Oracle to deal with Mrs.
Magee’s suggestion as he thought fit. But
here we are, Australians who love Australia
as few do who haven’t left it, all ready for
an immigration agent to get busy.

The Conduct of Mental Hospitals.
The conclusions of a trained observer:—
The N. S. Wales Lunacy Commission is now con-
sidering its report; but it is unfortunate that it
was unable to get a more personal knowledge of the
working of our asylums. The actual time spent bv
the Commissioners within the walls of the institution's
was negligible, and the evidence submitted came from
deponents who either had been committed persons
or were in the employ of the Inspector-General for
Insane. Evidence of patients and ex-patients can
only be accepted after the closest scrutiny ; and no
doctor or nurse is likely to criticise in hostile~fashloii
a system which he or she is paid to administer.
Quite a large section of the community is directly
interested, by blood tie or friendship, in the inmates
of our asylums, and it wants to know what steps are
taken and what methods pursued to restore the mental
health of the patients. Treatment will depend on
the medical officers, and in any hospital, mental or
otherwise, the composition of the staff is of primary
importance. Yet we do not find these positions adver-
tised or thrown open in any way for public competi-
tion, as is the invariable rule in other services. They
are filled as vacancies occur by some more or less
influential person getting - the ear of the Inspector-
General and having his particular candidate
appointed. The result has been that the asylums
have had doctors who, through difficulty in satisfying
the examiners at the University, have been shut ouc
ox general hospitals; others who, through personal
defect or misfortune, were temporarily workless; wit
very few indeed who felt genuinely drawn towards
the study of psychological medicine, and looked upon
the Lunacy Department as anythiixg more than a pro-
fessional refuge. The few who begin with enthusiasm
are soon disheartened by the haphazard, go-as-you-
please methods of the hospitals. The lack of system-
atic teaching of juniors, of systematic attempts at
treatment or research, and the dull routine
and stagnation of institutional work as organised
at present soon blunt the outlook of young psy-
chiatrists. So long as patients do not commit suicide,
are made moderately quiet by appropriate medica-
tion, take their food (or are fed, as the case may be)
at regular intervals and have a sufficiency of aperi-
ents, their medical needs are supposed to be satis-
fied. This is only to be expected in a medical staff
w’hose seniors are too busy with routine work to have
time, or too institutionalised to care, and whose
juniors are too raw and ill-equipped to give to
patients that careful individual attention which alone
can lead to their mental salvation. Patients are left
in the main to get better if they can, and the fact
that a fair percentage do resume their normal lives
cannot be laid to the credit of the medical staff.
The patients, apart from the inefficient and unintel-
ligent medical care they receive, are treated humanely
enough; at any rate, no active brutality, or the
results of it, were ever observed by the writer. But
the food is poor, consisting chiefly of meat, potatoes,
rice and bread, and the almost entire absence of fruit
and green vegetables gives it an appalling sameness.
There are other crudities which need onlv be men-
tioned here. For instance, patients who were up all
day were compelled to sleep in beds which had been
occupied all day by others who moved into an obser-
vation ward at night. No change of bedding occur-
led. In the main wards the sanitary convenience
consists of one seat in the middle of the ward, in
full view of all the occupants; and it is in use day
and night. The odors and risk of infection can be
imagined even by the layman.
The real remedy for the defects in our present
system lies in a more intelligent staffing of
the Lunacy service. One would suggest a board of
commissioners with an eminent alienist as chairman,
a business man (a proved organiser and accountant)-
and a member of the legal profession. These three
gentlemen, with the aid and advice of the professors
of medicine and psychiatry, could, subject to the
approval of the Public Service Board, make appoint-
ments to the medical staff. No graduate should
receive an appointment until he has served one year
in a general hospital or its equivalent; and every
vacancy should be advertised in the medical and lay
press. The number of medical officers should be
increased, as the present ratio of one doctor to 300
patients is palpably absurd, if the latter are to have
the close personal observation of their medical atten-
dant. The salaries for the first two years need not
be large, but after that there should be a sufficiently
rapid increase to make the career attractive to able
young men. Systematic teaching in psychological
medicine and institution management should be given
from the start. It is only by obtaining and training
a medical staff equal in calibre to those of general
hospitals that the community will be giving a fair
deal to its mentally afflicted members.
Restoring the Industrial Balance,
Hoskins’s ironworks at Lithgow, having a
big bricklaying job oh hand in connection
with an extension programme, and not enough
bricklayers to hurry it on, suggested to
these trade experts that they might allow
some laborers to take up bricklaying if they
were given a substantial increase of pay.
The men promptly refused to consider that
offer; then, seeing that the firm was in a
hurry, they put in a demand for an increase
in their own wages to bring them to 255.
per day, which they declared (probablv
rightly) they could secure outside. A simi-
lar stand is liable to be. taken by any body
of skilled, or partially-skilled, workmen when
a favorable opportunity offers for putting


on the screw. It matters not at all to them
that a firm may have made contracts on the
basis of certain wage rates —contracts which
will be so unprofitable if the rates are altered
without notice that the business may have to
close down, and irreparable harm be thus
done, not only to the employer, but
to the State, to other workers and even to
the employees themselves. During the last
couple of decades a new structure of vested
rights has been erected, and the workers
are prepared to hang to them as tenaciously
as, and wfith even more injurious conse-
quences than, the Fat man was accustomed
to hang on to what he regarded as his. The
“improver” has in consequence vanished now
from the trades; yet the improver system
was a useful one. Although usually it was
devised to benefit the young worker who had
had an insufficient apprenticeship training,
it also gave an opportunity for older men who
had missed apprenticeship altogether to
graduate from the ranks of the unskilled
to the skilled, or from one trade to another;
and so a disturbed industrial balance had
a chance of righting itself. When a demand
for labor grew in any calling, there was an
opportunity for men to enter it and leave
behind occupations which at the time offered
nothing but lack of occupation. It is quite
understandable that, having had it established
by the Wages Board system, workers in
specially benefitted classes should want to
maintain the vested right which exists in
their power to withhold supplies of labor
as a means of exacting higher rates of
wages ; but it is mainly the lack of balance
in the occupational classifications of the
people-—classifications which tend to become
as fixed as the castes of India—that causes
present unemployment. Certain callings
(mostly unskilled) are overcrowded, while
certain others (invariably skilled) are call-
ing loudly for man-power. If more were
employed in the latter there would be more
work to be done in the at-present overcrowded
callings. But not only are skilled trades
close corporations ; every batch of children
who leave school are intensifying the badness
of the present situation. Apprenticeship
appeals neither to young Bill, who is natur-
ally attracted by high wages and very little
by" indentures, nor to Bill’s parents, who
are worried about the cost of Bill’s upkeep
on apprentice’s wages. And the disgraceful
neglect on the part of some employers to
teach Bill his trade when he is indentured
is no doubt a factor. So, between one thing
and another, a woeful proportion of the
children who leave school go to crowd the
unskilled callings. The N. S. Wales Labor
Government did have some sort of construc-
tional scheme to meet the situation—a scheme
for technical training which would abbreviate
the period of apprenticeship, and other de-
vices aimed at getting a better industrial
balance. The present Government has
dropped the whole project, partly because it
is concerned with economy, and the Labor
scheme was full of extravagance, but greatly
because it was a Labor proposal. Yet it is
obvious that something requires to be done
to meet the entirely new industrial situation
which has been produced by arbitration
methods and other circumstances of the last
decade. All the schemes to relieve unemploy-
ment must come to nothing unless steps are
taken to attack the trouble at its root.

Australia’s Trade with Britain.
Dear Bulletin, —David Berry (B.
14/6/’23), writing with a knowledge of Eng-
lish markets, tells us this is Australia’s
“golden hour,” but that Australia mustn’t
ask for preference for its foodstuffs—it ought
to try bonuses on exports. Australia asks
preference from Britain chiefly for dried
fruit. Britain collects a duty of £7 a ton
on raisins and currants. If that duty were
relaxed in favor of the Dominions, how would
it add to the cost of the Briton’s living?
The only likely result would be that the
classic Greek, who now methodically destroys
one-third of each normal season’s raisin- and
currant-crop in order to keep up the price
he collects from the poor Briton, would have
to sell cheaper to compete with the Aus-
tralian fruit. Likewise, the wail about the
Briton groaning under- his load of food taxa-
tion sounds curious to us in a barley-grow-
ing district, who are authoritatively told
not to grow any more barley because the
poor Briton has finally decided to put an
import duty of 10s. a quarter on it—a tax
in the supposed interest of the British land-
owner. If Mr. Berry’s groaning Briton is
prepared to take on a rise of 6d. a bushel on
his barley in the interest of higher land rents
(or, say, higher wages for Hodge), there
seems no valid reason why he should not
suffer cheaper currants and raisins in the
interest of the higher standard of living in
Australia, especially as Australia is willing
to pay his passage out to the higher standard
of living. The proposed bonus on exported
products isn’t what we need. Do wool- and
wheat-growers require any bonus on tlieir
exports? Would a bonus on meat teach
the Australian beef-man to breed early-
maturing beef, as does the Argentine-grower,
and so get to market with the cost of feed
and the interest on capital cut in halves?
Anyhow, is it wise to encourage the export
of raw material any further, seeing that a
country that lives by the export of foodstuffs
will inevitably have to import war material at
an early date? A bonus on manufactures for
export does not look any more hopeful. When
a country that grows the finest wool in the
world, and has the best home market in
the world for woollen goods, prefers to pay
two of the longest freights in the world on
dirty wool, as well as exporters’ and im-
porters’ profits on five-sixths of the ’woollen
goods it uses, that country needs something
more vigorous than a bonus. What it needs
is another war. Four years of war did us
some good. We can make our own axe-
handles and clothes-pegs and a few other
things now. But a war is almost as expen-
sive as a bonus would be. How would a
Customs tariff equal in its incidence to the
war suit Mr. Berry? That would be cheap,
and he and the groaning Briton would have
no reason to make a grievous noise about it,
seeing that they have a duty of £7 a ton
on our dried fruit and one of 10s. a quarter
on our barley.—Yours, L. Ree.
The Great Manufacturing' Destiny of
N. S. Wales.
At the present moment rather more than
the usual number of noisy, popularity-hunt-
iug or axe-grinding people afflict N. S. Wales
with a craving to seize folk and put them
violently “on the land,” and then to reluc-
tantly accept a baronetcy or something in
return for their services. There is something
grotesque in the unsuitableness of it all, as
well as something that should arouse a healthy
indignation at the parasites who prosper on
the game. N. S. Wales ranks only fourth
among the six States and one Territory for
the number of acres it possesses with the ser-
viceable rainfall of 20in. per annum and
over, and there is no reason why it should
be expected to do such marvels at agricul-
ture, even if every root is manured with bor-
rowed' money, that it should make itself a
bankrupt over the business. On the other
hand, as a State which produces 82 per cent,
of the Commonwealth’s coal, and turns out
far more value of minerals in the aggregate
than all the rest of the Commonwealth, it
should have a mighty future in manufac-
tures. In fact, it is doing pretty well in
that line and pretty badly in most others —
the ones that are boosted with the big loans.
The employment figures and the public debt
figures need to be read together, for the
public debt is supposed to be mostly incurred
so that more and more people may go on
the land and be rural:—

The rural businesses (everything from cattle
and sheep down to bees) appear, by another
table of figures, still to turn out more value
than the solitary item of manufactures, but
in that table manufactures are given net
(i.e., output, less value of raw material),
while the others are gross figures. If gross
values are taken in each case, the selling
price of goods which quitted the N. S. Wales
factories in 1922 was set down at
£132,811,065, while the products of rural in-
dustry, forestry, fishing, mining and trap-
ping added up to £73,801,000. And probably
before long the number of factory employees,
as well as the gross output, will exceed that
of all other producers. This result is arrived
at despite the insane and malignant efforts
made in the Ma State to drive all factory
industry to Sydney by strange dodges and
devices done with the railways, or to destroy
it if it doesn’t go—achieved because manu-
factures are, probablv even more than the
splendidly profitable pastoral business, what
the Ma State was made for. It is difficult
to say what it might not achieve if petty-
minded old women in politics allowed indus-
trial towns to grow up at every good port;
and agriculture to grow up around them, as
it naturally would. There is still a tremen-
dous local market for more and still more
manufactured goods to take the place of the
ruinous mass of imports, while the local de-
mand for more wheat is nil until more popu-
lation comes. As to the reason why politi-
cal blighters want so badly to lose tens of
loan millions on promoting the business which
the State can’t do with any unusual suc-
cess, while utterly neglecting, or even ham-
pering, the one which is its particular metier,
that can be set out in few words: —
If any roaring philanthropist, tub-thumping in
Martin-place, Sydney, urged the borrowing of
£40,000,000, to be handled in a patronising, self-
advertising way by himself and his friends in start-
ing State factories, he would be howled down. The
country is tired of such things. Anyhow, he wouldn’t
attempt it. The failure of a factory comes home to
roost with the first balance-sheet.
If he proposed borrowing £40,000,000 to set up
soldiers or miscellaneous folk, who hardly know a
plane from a shuttle, in nice little factories, he might
even have decayed fruit heaved at him.
If he went to capable men like McKay of the
harvester or Vicars of the woollen mills with proposals
for 'setting them up in loan-money factories, to
work under the supervision of some limelit figure
like himself, and to have their buyings and sellings
done through his “board” after the manner of the
Bankstown hen-farmers, he would probably be told
to stand out of the daylight.
But it is possible to get glory, limelight, adver-
tisement, political pull, and sometimes the handling
of millions of money with a rehash, if it is a large
and cheeky and plausible rehash, of any old scheme
for “settlement” and pleasant country “homes,”
even if it is only a plan to get off the land the
solvent man who knows, and put on it the heavily
indebted man who doesn’t know. And by conces-
sions and further assistance the failure may be
disguised for years.
In short, vulgar advertisement is the mother
of a great deal of land ‘‘settlement.”
The One White Country that is
Increasingly Red.
The Communists who infest Britain have
again been told by the Labor party of that
country that it wouldn’t be seen in the same
paddock with them. At last year’s Labor
convention their proposal for an alliance was
rejected by a card vote of 3,087,000 to
261,000. At the latest affair of the kind the
majority against affiliation was just on
Sto 1—2,888,000 to 366,000. The improve-
ment from the Communist point of view is
doubtless traceable in part to the glad news
from Australia that the local Moscow faction
has been received into the A.L.P., to the
extent, at any rate, that the oracle could
be worked at the late N. S. Wales confer-
ence. But considering (1) the gulf between
Ayes and Noes, and (2) the contemptuous
refusal of the B.L.P. to adopt Newbold,
Communist member for Motherwell, it will
bring no joy to the Bosses in Russia. Three
or four years ago the Bosses had high hopes
of making the world a Red ruin. They be-
gan with a prodigious propaganda fund, got
by looting everything lootable, and had a
magnificent field to work in— i.e., the coun-
tries broken or impoverished by the war.
Unlike France in 1793, their territory was
incapable of being surrounded or even seri-
ously invaded; nor were they reduced to
employing the sword as a means of conver-
sion, after first using it to repel attacks
from all points of the compass, as was the
case with the French. Yet their achieve-
ments, compared with those of the French
Revolutionaries in an age that lacked wire-
less, proletarian organisations, sympathetic
Labor newspapers and the like, are contemp-
tible. They haven’t even held tlieir own
in what used to be the Russian Empire.
Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
Poland, all parts of Russia in 1914, are now
anti-Bolshevist Republics. Bessarabia has
joined Roumania, which is also anti-Bolshe-
vist. Hungary tried a Soviet Government
in 1919, but repented after five months of
brisk murder and robbery. South Africa
has also had a bit of a Red rising, and
Italy might have had another but for Mus-
solini and his Fascisti, albeit there were
only 16 Communists among the 535 Depu-
ties elected to the Italian Lower House in
1921. Austria, despite its misery, has
spurned the blandishments of the Bolsh. So
have Germany and Czecho-Slovakia and the
other Slav confederation which has Servia
at its head. And there is no prospect of
the Red frenzy prevailing in France, Bel-
gium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Spain, Portugal, Canada, the U.S.A., Brazil,
Argentina, Chile or Maoriland. Defeated
in Europe and scourged from America, Com-
munism has definitely failed as a world-
movement. Its only recent converts have
been made among people who have been
thrashed into a receptive frame of mind by
the Red Army, or who have been excited by
hopes that the force in question, with its
battalion of Chinese executioners, will lead
the patient East in a war against Europe,
or whose Labor leaders have been intimi-
dated into accepting a made-in-Russia policy,
being a poor, pigeon-livered lot. In short,
the Reds have crashed everywhere except
in Georgia, Armenia, Bokhara, Persia,
Afghanistan—and Australia.
Concerning- Immigrants.
Gilbert Mant after an experiment:—
To test a theory, I came back from England on
a Commonwealth liner with 600-odd immigrants.
1 have arrived at several conclusions which may
be worth setting down.
On information supplied bv the autocrats at
Australia House, London papers (notably the Times,
Daily Telegraph and Morning Post) have been
launching forth in eulogy of the type of English
immigrant coming- to Australia. Leader-writers
have pushed their pens to a standstill, embryo
statesmen have shouted themselves hoarse. Yet
month after month one reads partially-suppressed
accounts of dissatisfied immigrants returning to Eng-
land and complaining of their treatment here.
The truth is, dissatisfied immigrants are returning
to Manchester and Liverpool because they were dis-
satisfied before they started. The six weeks on my
“Bay” liner were a continuous growl from gentlemen
whose vocabulary was limited mostly to “Aye-ee, by
Goom!” It began with the food. The immigrants
didn’t like it. They said the rice was hard and
the beef tough. They objected to meat three times
a day. They thought Devonshire apples far superior
to Tasmanian—by Goom! Now, the food carried
was excellent. A three-course lunch with lime-juice
and apples satisfied the mere Australians on board,
who didn’t expect much for £45. The immigrant
whose passage cost him £22 expected far more. We
carried 50 boys, of from 14 to 20, who were going
to W.A. under some settlement scheme. They put
the worst larrikins of Woolloomooloo in the shade.
Sleep was impossible in the uproar they made at
night. They were so beastly that the skipper
threatened to return the whole issue at Port Said.
Why the authorities at Australia House sanctioned
their coming passes my understanding.
For the adult immigrants (with, of course, excep-'
tions) one can make no allowances. They have
ccme to Australia to make a fortune without work-
ing for it. When they discover that hard work is
required in Cook's “land of golden opportunity,”
they will return to England and write indignant
letters to the press. And Joseph will reply and
the honor of Australia will be upheld.
The crying pity of the whole thing is that in
Great Britain thousands of the right kind of immi-
grants are unemployed and anxious to try their
luck here. But Canada puts forward a more attrac-
tive programme, and to Canada they go. S’Africa.
with engaging frankness, advertises her disadvantages,
and asks chiefly for men with capital. In contrast
the people at Australia House order reams of high-
falutin advertising matter, and let it go at that.
Their methods are lackadaisical and sleepy. They
allow good immigrants to slip through their fingers,
and content themselves with chronic grumblers and
wasters, whose only desire is to come here at our
expense, and get back as quickly as possible. London
is scattered with outside agencies canvassing for
immigrants. To them an immigrant means simply
a commission. Their troubles about Australia!
I tried to secure a Scotch friend a passage. His
qualifications were 0.K., and he would have made
good; yet after three months’ hammering at Aus-
tralia House the only satisfaction he received was a
notice that his application was being considered.
The immigration officials showed a supreme indiffer-
ence to his existence. My friend is now in Canada.
So there you are.
Spend a day in Perth arid Fremantle. Both towns
are filled with young factory lads from Great Britain
looking for a job. Why? Because they put in
three weeks with Cocky in the bush, got “fed oop”
with the life, and slouched back to the beer and
picture-shows. They cadge money in the streets.
I spoke to one lad. He had come from a Birmingham
razor-blade factory. It was very easy to get a refer-
ence from a J.P. whom he had never seen before,
and Australia House had labelled him as an experi-
enced farmhand, and despatched him to W.A. After
three weeks’ rouseabouting, Paradise to him meant
that Birmingham razor-blade factory.
It boils down to this, then; the handling of the
business on the other side is utterly bad.
Old Laws and New Buildings.
Concerning a flaw in the law which calls
for early attention :
The founders of a colony carry with them all the
statute and common law of the mother country
applicable to their circumstances and condition;
so on the foundation of N. S. Wales in 1788 the
English law then in existence became the law of
the new colony, and in particular the law with
regard to land and interests in land.
In addition to the ordinary rights of an owner
of land to do things within the boundaries of that
land, the law of England recognises rights
that can be exercised by the owner of land over
the land of his neighbor. A right of way is the
most obvious example of such an “easement” ; if
the owner of Block A has a private right of way
across Block B, he does not own any of Block B and
cannot take a spadeful of earth of it away, but he
may pass over it. An easement is something that
attaches to one piece of land in respect of another
piece of land, and imposes an obligation upon the
owner of the land over which it exists not to alter
the state of it so as to interfere with the enjoy-
ment of the easement by the owners of the other land.
Two of the most important kinds of easement are
easements of light and easements of air. The law
recognised the right to a free flow of air to a build-
mg and also an uninterrupted passage of light,
because they were supposed to be provisions of nature
for the general good; but as light and air cannot be
measured unless something has been constructed to
receive them, the law laid down that there must
first be a window or similar aperture through which
the light and air could be enjoyed.
An easement could be created by a grant by the
owner of one piece of land to the owner of
the adjoining piece of land. If, however,
it could be shown that the owners of a piece of
land had enjoyed an easement over another piece of
land without interruption for 20 years, the law
presumed that there must have been a grant and
that it had been lost. Similarly, if a man has
uninterrupted possession of land for 20 years, he gets
a legal title to that land. Therefore if the owner
of Block A built a house on his boundary with a
window looking out over Block B, and enjoyed
the use of that window for 20 years, the English law
gave the owner of Block A an easement of light and
of air over Block B, and the owner of Block B was
thereafter debarred from building on the adjoining
boundary of Block B in such a way as to shut off
the light and air from that window.
About 20 years ago Mr. Delohery, S.M., owned
a house at Potts Point. The Permanent Trustee
Co. owned some land adjoining, and started to erect
on it a lofty building that would shut off some
of the light from Delohery's windows. Delohery
was a magistrate learned in the law ; further, he had
one son a solicitor and another a barrister. So he
went to law with the Trustee Co. to prevent its
interference with his windows. He claimed that he
had a prescriptive right to light and air for his
windows over the company’s land, and that such
right had been granted to him or his predecessors
in title by a grant which had been lost. Of course
it was not seriously contended that such a grant
ever existed, but rather that, because he had enjoyed
the light and air for the full time laid down by law,
the Court would presume the existence of a lost
grant. The Chief Judge in Equity, however, decided
that the state of things in a new country like this
differed from that in an old-settled country like
England, that the use of the old fiction of a lost
grant would not be beneficial, so the case must be
decided against Delohery. Delohery appealed to
the High Court, and the Judges (Griffith, Barton
and O’Connor) reversed the decision of the Chief
Judge in Equity, and decided that in their opinion
the law of prescription las to ancient lights was
part of the law of N. S. Wales. It was not allowed
to remain part of the law for very long. The High
Court decision was given in May, 1904 ; and in
December, 1904, the Ancient Lights Declaratory Act
was passed which enacted that thereafter no right
to the access or use of light to or for any building
shall be deemed to exist or be capable of coming
into existence by reason only of the enjoyment of
such access or use for any period, or of any pre-
sumption of a lost grant based upon such enjoyment.
In most of the cases about infringements of ease-
ments of light the words , “light and air” are used as
if they were one and the. same thing. But there are
cases where the right to air for ventilation without
any right to light has been successfully maintained.
It would have been • simple, when the Ancient Lights
Declaratory Act was passed, to have added the
words “and air” ; but it was not done. As the
law now stands, if a building has received air for
20 years through one of its windows, looking out over
adjoining land, then an easement of air by pre-
scription has been acquired over such adjoining land.
The consequence of this may be serious to owners of
valuable city • properties. For instance, if there
are three properties in George-street, each with a
50 feet frontage, and if the owners of the two out-
side blocks erect 10-storey buildings, whereas the
owner of the middle block continues to carry on
with his old four-storey building; then, if, after
20 years, the man in the middle wishes to put up
a new building to the same height as his neigh-
bors, according to the law as it now stands he may
be prevented from using the land ' that he owns
because by doing so he would be interfering with
the access of air that he bad allowed his neighbors
to enjoy without interruption for 20 years.
It is only about 20 years ago that Sydney began
to extend skywards. In those days the Equitable
Building in George-street was one of the city sights
to be inspected by country cousins. Nowadays there
are hundreds of high buildings, and every day sees
them being further added to. Unless the law is
amended without delay there is a prospect that the
legal profession will reap a rich harvest in the near
future.
♦
A Dangerous Innovation.
Another move was made towards the Yan-
keefication of Australia when a so-called
Night Patrol was established in Sydney a
few days ago by a private syndicate. The
present idea is that the Night Patrol shall
only assist the police in preventing and de-
tecting robberies: nothing is further from the
thoughts of the organisers, for example, than
that it shall undertake the divorce-inquiry
work which has won Sydney private detec-
tives such an unsavory fame. The original
intentions of these concerns are usually be-
yond criticism. Pinkerton’s New York
detective agency, which is obviously the in-
spiration of the Sydney one, began its career
as a patriotic body: its forces were directed
against the spies of the South during the
Civil War. Then the war ended and money
had to be made in other directions. Pin-
kerton’s men have since tackled everything,
from strike-breaking on an active-service
scale to wholesale blackmail. It was largely
owing to the bad taste left in the mouths of
decent Americans by the methods of the
Pinkerton agency that Burns’s Interna-
tional Detective Agency got Jts chance.. It
also claimed to be a law-abiding and patriotic
concern, and more or less maintained that
reputation till it was discovered, during the
World War, to be in the pay of the German
Government. The chief business of the
Burns agency until the middle of 1917 was,
in the words of the New York Times, “to
manufacture evidence tending to show that
the Allies were breaking -the neutrality laws.”
There is a psychological significance about
the fact that the criminal-looking plain-
clothes men with whom Yankee films and
Yankee crime-plays have familiarised Aus-
tralia invariably enter the bedroom of the
persecuted heroine wearing their hats and
smoking cigars. Lion-tamers put up a simi-
lar bluff with their futile whips. The Night
Patrols of the U.S.A. freely exercise the
rights of arrest, search and entry, forcible
and otherwise ; and where they have to deal
with known criminals, prostitutes, foreign-
ers without money and illiterates, they man-
age to carry their illegalities off. Not so,
however, when they are rash enough to tackle
knowledgeable citizens, with the cash to fight
them in the courts: there have been numer-
ous such cases in which the hard-faced men
in the irremovable hats have gone down
heavily. The chief danger to Australia in
allowing a tradition of extra-legality to be

Marmite makes the tastiest of all sand-
wiches, a satisfying cup of steaming broth,
and to rissoles, croquettes, sours, stews
and sauces, Marmite imparts a delicious
flavour and at the same time doubles the
nourishment of these foods.
Marmite is a pure vegetable extract, rich
in Vitamins, and more nutritious than any
meat extract ever made.
Increase the nourishment you get from your
food, and you will increase your health
and fitness. Vitamin-B is the spark that
enables you to extract this nourishment from
food, and Marmite is rich in Vitamin-B.
Marmite is obtainable at all leading grocers

initiated here is a matter of there being
very few Australians who are either ignorant
of their rights as free citizens, or reluc-
tant to assert them. It is true that our pri-
vate-inquiry agents have with a certain
amount of impunity “touted” suspected phil-
anderers, and even broken into houses by
night in search of divorce-court evidence —
this in spite of warnings from the Bench
that they were liable on the one hand to
violent assault, and on the other to be
arrested and charged with burglary. But the
Night Patrol will have to cope with a bigger,
better organised, and in every way more for-
midable section of the community. The
American agencies have, at any rate, State
licenses to warrant some of their autocratic
proceedings, and lend a flavor of justifica-
tion to the others. Here anyone attempting
to exercise a policeman’s powers without the
authority of the Act is liable to a heavy
penalty. If Sydney’s patrolmen attempt to
arrest suspects they will be resisted; if they
attempt to search people they will be
assaulted; if they pursue possible malefac-
tors into private dwellings they may be shot.
In short, their activities will lead to the
very state of affairs which the police are em-
ployed to prevent, and that the latter appre-
ciate it was evidenced by the official protest
they lodged as soon as the formation of the
Night Patrol was made public. The position
is simple enough : if Sydney is under-policed
it is the business of the Government to
rectify the scandal at once, and if it is not
the Night Patrol is a dangerous superfluity.
“Who on Earth Reads the ‘Government
Gazette’?”
The member for the Northern Territory pro-
ceeded to earn his salary early by calling
attention to an “ordinance” which would
have automatically
become law in an-
other day if it hadn’t
been dragged from
its repose on the
Parliamentary table.
(The N.T. is mis-
governed by “ordiu-
a nce s”; they be-
c o m e law after
they have been
o ffi cia 11 y adver-
tised, and have then
ripened their ap-
pointed time on the
table.) According to
Nelson, M.H.R.,
this was a particu-
larly gross and ut-
terly inexcusable at-
tempt to lengthen
the, Territory pas-
toral leases under
which great areas are
locked up at almost
nil per annum—not
merely to renew
leases which were
falling due, but to
rush in and extend
leases which didn’t
necessarily come up
for consideration for
years. Had it gone
through the Govern-
me n t would have
been relieved of all
worry about the
South-to-North rail-
way for the term of
its natural life; it
could simply say that
the lock-up of the
land made profitable

possible. It is a Government with
lots of energy, but only for things
fairly close to its old familiar, crowded
haunts, and it seems as ill-fitted for
pioneering as any of its predecessors, so it
might be glad to have the big railway off its
mind. The Government’s rather faint and
colorless account of the effect of its proposed
“ordinance” was. of course, different from
that of Nelson, M.H.R.; still, the latter had
the satisfaction of knowing that the ques-
tionable business is held up for investigation.
But here a situation more astounding than
a bushel of “ordinances” comes in. The
document had been lying on the table of the
House for weeks, and apparently nobody
had looked at it. If one Oppositionist hail
seen it before Nelson took the matter up
it would, one would think, have been made
the subject of a censure motion for certain.
It was published in the Government
Gazette, and apparently not a soul troubled
to read it. “Who on earth reads the Gov-
ernment Gazette?” shouted Mahony, of
N. S. Wales. Well, Mahony is paid to read
it, and if he doesn’t he collects his screw’
under false pretences. Public notices are
put in the Gazette, which members can have
gratis, so that members, knowing they are
there, may have no excuse for not knowing
their business. As a condensed essay on
“How We Are Governed,” Mahony’s re-
mark ranks with sayings which have become
historical. Presumably a good many of the
crazy doings which have been the undoing
of a great possession happened through over-
paid humorists not reading the Gazette,
and the best excuse for the worst of them
is that the Ministry took silence for con-
sent and approval.

On a round peg in a square hole:—
In an appreciation of Brudenell White it is
written that “after his brilliant work in Gallipoli
and France he returned to Australia in 1919 to
advise the Commonwealth Government on the ques-
tion of the future military organisation of Australia.”
Probably as a sign that this question has been
dropped, White has been taken from a job which
he understands as well as any living man and
placed in one for which he has no qualifications
superior to those of hundreds of elderly gents, who
wouldn’t know a sap from a counterscarp. The
organiser of victory in France is to become chair-
man of the new Public Service Board, with a
deciding voice as to whether Gertie the typist
is entitled to a rise of £lO p.a. on account of the
increased cost of hose and frillies. Talk of set-
ting an elephant to crack nuts. The appointment
has been justified on the score of preference to
returned soldiers. But that preference to returned
men has not hitherto been regarded as applying
to professional soldiers. It was promised as a
reward for or compensation to civilians who left
their occupations to enlist for war service, and
who found themselves at considerable disadvantage
on their return. In the Government Gazette of
April 5, applications for appointments to the Public
Service Board were called for. Questions asked
in the House of Reps, elicit that General White
did not apply. How, then, did he come to be
appointed ? The Prime Minister explains that
none of the applicants was considered fit for the
billet of chairman. This is too thin. There were
many applicants, and some of them made no secret
of the fact that they were after the chairmanship.
Also, considering the scarcity of £2500 p.a. posi-
tions, and the abundance of persons with experience
of running substantial businesses and departments,
it is idle to declare that all the applicants were
inferior. Already the gibe has been published that
“it is another Melbourne Club appointment.” Aus-
tralia certainly owes White something, but why in
the name of sanity isn’t the debt paid with a job
for which his fitness has been demonstrated in
the fiery test of war, instead of one which he will
have to learn, like any novice ?
Germany’s little reparations bill was fixed
at 132 billion marks, of which it has paid
12 billions; it is supposed to pay the cost
of the armies-of-occupation as well, but the
bill for that has never been made up—and
probably never will be. The unpaid repara-
tions run into 6000 million pounds, or about
32 times the total debt of N. S. Wales. It
is colossal; still, Germany used to have, and
nominally has, an internal debt of 4000
million pounds, taking the mark at the old
rate of exchange. The best that German econo-
mists so far say they can do is about 40 bil-
lion marks, or 2000 million pounds—a third
of the amount the Allies fixed. The Hun
can probably afford to pay a good deal more
than he says lie can. His old internal debt
suggests that; and, moreover, he had mort-
gages on real estate running into 2500 mil-
lion pounds, and that, like the internal State
debt, has been practically wiped out
by the depreciation of the mark. Of
course, it was one thing for Hans
to pay Fritz the interest on the
old internal debts, and it would be quite an-
other thing for Hans and Fritz to pay year
after year interest on a foreign debt, plus
sinking fund; but as against that has to
be set the fact that there was probably as
much real estate unencumbered as there was
with a plaster on it. The reparations bill
was no doubt fixed too high ; but when the
debtor wants to cut down by more than two-
thirds he asks too much. The sooner he has
another guess the better.
German Verge, by his will, gave the resi-
due of his estate for “the benefit of N. S.
Wales returned soldiers.” The will was at-
tacked, but the Court upheld it. Now, at
the instance of Sydney Verge, a brother of
the testator, an appeal is to be made to the
Privy Council. The appellant is, however,
prepared to compromise for £30,000, which
would leave the returned soldiers £90,000.
The question is whether this compromise
should be accepted. If the Privy Council
fires out the will, the returned soldiers will
lose £90,000; if it sustains the will they
gain £120,000, less a few thousands costs.
Obviously, what has to be settled first is
the chance of the appeal succeeding before
the Privy Council. There is confessedly
some doubt about it. Maughan, K.C., and
Jordan, both sound Equity barristers,
argued against the will in the N. S. Wales
Supreme Court. Bethune, K.C., another
Equity man, consulted as to the validity of
the will, advised: —
I am clearly of opinion that this case is essentially
one for settlement. It is unnecessary to point <*ut
the great uncertainty that always must exist as to
the result of an appeal, even where there is the great-
est confidence of success.
The doubt as to whether the will can be
maintained arises out of the absence of any
direction as to the use to which the money
is to be put. A gift for the benefit of dis-
tressed soldiers, for example, would be a
good gift. But all that it is really neces-
sary to insist upon is that there is a doubt;
apart from Bethune’s definite opinion, if
is certain that Maughan, K.C., and Jordan
would not have attacked the will if they did
not believe that they had at least a fighting
chance. Bavin, Attorney-General, is, how-
ever, apparently not disposed to allow the
matter to be compromised. The returned
soldiers (through their league) are under-
stood to favor a settlement. Where, in that
case, does Mr. Bavin come in'? It is
they whose money is being risked. If they
do not want it risked, why risk it!

Prom an old unionist:—
Labor gets all the blame for the gradual dis-
appearance of apprentices. Nothing is said about
the greed and unpatriotic spirit of employers.
I know a firm—one of the biggest in the building-
trade —that kept a lad on one elementary task for
18 months. He had learned how to do it in two
days, and was dying to drop out of the game. There
are scores of such cases. On a job at Melbourne
Uni. there were from 60 to 70 masons engaged in
the highest class of work, and one boy. On the
new Town Hall, Brisbane, are just two embryo
masons. I am now working on one of the finest
Gothic churches in Australia, There are 13 masons
on the job and no apprentices. And the record
of the State masonry works at Maroubra (N.S.W.),
which carry a big squad of quarrymen and stone
cutters, is not much better. Even the State fails
to encourage apprenticeship when it has the chance.
Do we masons oppose boys coming into the trade ?
Not on your life: some of us view with sorrow the
decay of the most artistic branch of architecture in
favor of cheap stucco and ugly reinforced concrete.
Anyhow, what could weak craft unions like ours
do to oppose the powerful building corporations
tliat employ us if they were public-spirited enough
to get the lads? My remarks refer particularly to
masons, bricklayers and plasterers, but they could
be applied just as truly to other trades and indus-
tries. So have a go at thpse cheap-minded employers
who are forever whining about the dearth of skilled
labor but won’t lift their fingers to help craftsmen
who are willing to impart their knowledge to the
Australian youth. And here is another point. In
the last Arbitration hearing for masons the Q’land
Juuge dropped the apprentices’ wages Is. 6d. a
week. I don’t suppose there are a dozen of them
all told. Can you imagine anything more paltry?

The mildest thing said these days about old
Hun New Guinea, now administered by Aus-
tralia under mandate, is that the tidy plan-
tations out of which the Germans made for-
tunes are now run at a great loss, that the
jungle is eating them up, and that the name
of the Australian as a man who knows how
to do things is mud —bottomless mud. He
not only can’t make farms out of forest, it
is said, but he can’t prevent ready-made
farms going back to forest. This disaster so
moved Sydney Telegraph that it broached
the theory that the Australian, as shown by
his twin failures in the N. Territory and in
Hun New Guinea, may be constitutionally
unfit to manage tropical property, and should
leave the work to cold-weather Englishmen.
If true that would open a gloomy prospect
for a White Australia, which is more than
one-third tropic; but it isn’t true. The
Australian is a very good man in the tropics,
but W. M. Hughes isn’t. The story of the
dramatic collapse of the Territory was, bar-
ring the brief Joe Cook interregnum, a story
of direct Hughes management. The
tale of the collapse of industry in
the mandated ex-Hun colony is also a
tale of Hughes management. Petulant,
galvanic, a know-
nothing in a business
sense, a know-all in
his own self-estima-
tion, and an unde-
cided creature of fits
and starts, Hughe?
was and is about as
well- qualified to
make ruin as any
man. The policy
adopted in the N.
Territory was to ap-
point- as many offi-
cials as there was
standing room for,
to make an end of
any semblance o f
self-government, to
prohibit the freehold
settler, to forget
about roads and rail-
wa y s and harbor
works, and then to
telegraph new laws
from Melbourne at a
breathless pace. With
variations suited to
the circumstances it
was the same in
New Hun Guinea.
The chief business of
officialdom, which is
numerous, is to keep
an eye on the “ordin-
ances,” of which in
1922, there were
“about 60,” includ-
ing “orders and pro-
clamations,” left
over from the mili-
tary occupation;
“about 40” (the Fed-
er a 1 Statistician

new ones made as soon as the civil authori-
ties took charge; and about 59 others of
varied origin. The new droves of managers
were naturally judged, until exposure was
inevitable, much more by the accuracy with
which they filled in returns (numbered from
1 to 7488 b) than by the way they grew
cocoanuts, for the reports went straight to
the Minister and the cocoanuts didn’t. In
the case of each Territory the boss was too
far from the spot, and he was trying to be
in too many spots at once. And he wasn’t
the right kind of boss.
“Mountain Ash”: The ill-fated Trevessa
was equipped with a wireless plant, but all
that could be done with it was to notify the
nearest vessels in the Indian Ocean the lati-
tude and longitude where the vessel was sink-
ing. Had only the ship’s boats been able to
signify their whereabouts to would-be res-
cuers, what a difference it might have made!
And such a thing is really feasible enough
nowadays. Small, portable wireless plants,
capable of being carried about in a box the
size of an ordinary suitcase, are procurable,
and they have a surprisingly wide range of
efficiency for their size. If the Board of
Trade made it compulsory for every vessel to
carry one of these portable outfits, to meet
such emergencies as shipwreck or even the
breakdown of the main plant, it would be
another stand-by for those in peril on the
sea. In the case of the Trevessa the money
spent in the lengthy and fruitless search, in
which three or four vessels were engaged,
would have bought hundreds of portable
plants.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the Federal Gallery:—
Bruce showed the measure of his determination in
the Reps, last week by gagging through a Supply
Bill for £4,154,000 in a 20-hour sitting. Labor
was wandering at large on the subject, when the
Priminister applied the closure, guillotining every
item with a remorseless flow of divisions, which
amounted to over 60 for the night’s work. There
were several outbursts of Opposition fury, during
one of which the vociferous Gabb was suspended,
whilst old Jack West nearly suffered the same fate.
Much of the trouble was due to the tired Chairman
and his deputies losing control of the House. Bam-
ford was fairly firm, but Watkins was slack,, and
Bayley, the second understudy, showed ludicrous
weakness. When I looked into the Chamber about
8.15 a.m. Bayley was trying to take a division, and
Anstey, ignoring continuous reminders that he, was
“out of order,” was delivering an impromptu protest
at the table. He took up the ingenious stand that,
though he couldn’t address the House, he could still
discuss matters of public moment with the “honor-
able member for Bourke” ; and brushing aside Bay-
ley’s feeble rebukes, he went on talking to himself
in a loud voice. It was an absurd situation, even
Bruce being among the laughers, and Heaven knows
how it would have ended if Anstey hadn’t tired of
the joke and retired to a seat on the front Opposition
bench.
Vic. Premier Lawson is now on his way
from Vancouver to Sydney, where he is due
on July 25. An attempt will be made to
force a reconstruction of his Ministry as
soon as he returns to Melbourne, and it will
depend on circumstances whether he will
comply. It is expected that his team will
give him a free hand, but if McPherson and
Robinson say they will not join any new
combination, the Premier will probably de-
cide to stand or fall with his present lot.
Still, he has been a tireless reconstructor,
having had 20 mates off and on. Three are
dead.
N . S. Wales has a debt of about
£190,000,000, two-thirds of which is foreign
debt; so that (apart from its share of the
Federal burden) it has to send away about
£6,000,000 a year before it can begin to pay
for a thing which it imports. In other
words, its exports must exceed its imports
by £6,000,000 a year in order to keep its
accounts square, irrespective of what it owes
on Commonwealth account. But instead of
exporting more than it imports its imports
exceeded its exports by no less than
£10,065,000 during the first 11 months of
the current fiscal year (from July 1, 1922,
to May 31, 1923). The State’s exports have
been just over £4,000,000 less than they were
in the corresponding fraction of the previous
year ; but the imports were £10,828,000 more.
It is quite obvious that we can’t go on like
this: everybody must know that the man
who gets £5 a week and spends £6 is head-
ing for the rocks. It takes a big country
longer to get there, of course, because it is
allowed to go far into debt; but the end
must be the same in either case—unless the
course is altered.
The 27th or 144th investigation into the
umbrageous purchase of somebody’s property
for closer settlement has finished, and ‘'the
Commission” believes it knows who got the
usual commish or swindle money. “Pro-
ceedings” are talked off. Of course, any
question of the sort is quite separate from
the harmless problem as to who got half
as much again as the land was worth, owing;
to the Department rushing in with bags of
Federal loan money and becoming a competi-
tive purchaser. Amid all this robbery, job-
bery and bribery, it is difficult to keep in
mind the fact that the Federal authority
has 191,000,000 acres of its own ready for
settlement without fraud, scandal or back-
stairs influence, and nearly as much more
that will be available when the leases run
out, and that nothing has been done for years
to develop one acre of it.

THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY.
“Following the example of the Federal Nationalists, the Lawson Government is contemplating a
coalition with the Vie. Country party to stave off the defeat which is alleged to be impending.”
LAWSON: “ Excellent idea! I’ll doll up like Bruce and see if I can’t get a country
girl, too.”
planters have chosen the pool. They are
not at all enthusiastic about it, but since the
Hughes agreement is gone and only the
Queensland Reps, would support a £l4 duty,
there is nothing better in sight. Swayne,
M.L.A. for Mirani, who has been putting
the case for the industry in Melbourne, re-
turned with the news that if the arrange-
ment works well for the two years it is to
last, there will be no trouble about getting
an extension for another two. There isn’t
likely to be any trouble as far as the public
is concerned: it will get sugar at 44d. But
how the growers will come out of it depends
almost wholly upon their labor teams.
The ancient and fish-like controversy as
to whether Martin-place, Sydney, should be
carried through to Macquarie-street reached
an appearance of finality last week, when an
extension scheme, with leasehold tacked on,
was adopted by the city aldermen. The net
cost to the ratepayers is reckoned at
£392,000, and the loss is estimated at
£24,000 p.a. for the first five years and
£6lOO p.a. for 45 years afterwards, but it
is hoped to unload some of it on the general
taxpayer, every plan for titivating Sydney
being regarded as "a national work.” Martin-
place is only the length of two small city
blocks, and it won’t be much of a street with
two narrow blocks added. But some people
will do very well out of options and things.
Some of the seven metropolitan Libs, who are
clamoring in Victoria for redistribution of
seats may be cursed with the burden of an
answered prayer. Boroondara, Greenwood’s
constituency, now has 50,000 electors, and
in its altered shape he will have difficulty
in beating a man like William Mcßeatli.
Politics are only a sideline with Argyle, of
Toorak, and the doctor isn’t worrying. But
the enlargement of Bast Melbourne might be
the end of Farthing, who has hitherto had
a pocket borough; and it would not take
much to turn Tommy Ryan’s Essendon seat
into something soft for a Labor man of the
Slater type. Nor is Fetherston as secure
in Prahran as he would like to be. The only
absolute certainty, whatever happens, is
Grandmaster Snowball. Only a resuscitated
Bent could displace him in Brighton.
Some demon of inaccuracy appears to
haunt the pro-Canberras. When Mahony,
M.11.R., moved that the Australian Parlia-
ment should shift to Cotter’s banks not
less than three years hence, Prime Minister
Bruce said “the establishment of the capi-
tal at Canberra was one of the important fac-
tors which induced N. S. Wales to agree
to Federation.” It was the habitual thing
to say, and Bruce has a habit of being habi-
tual; but as a matter of fact the very name
of the hamlet (population 164) was unknown
even to N. S. Wales till years after the State
“agreed” to enter into its own movement.
But Maloney, of Victoria and the shock of
hair, hit the roof with the assurance that
“Canberra represented the greatest experi-
ment in land tenure ever attempted.” The
Government owns nearly 600,000 acres of
capital site, and most of this, anyhow, is
supposed never to be alienated. That is
the “land tenure” in question. It also owns
334,600,000 acres on exactly the same terms
in the Northern Territory; but apparently
little Maloney never heard of that place.
From an old political hand:—
The Lawson (Vic.) Government promised three years
ago to reduce the number of members from 65 to
60 and to recast constituencies on the basis of 100
city to 60 country electors. That would mean
35 country and 25 metropolitan seats. Whether the
1920 proposals are equitable or not, there is now no
chance of their being- adopted. The metropoli-
tan area, including Brighton, may get 25 seats —an
increase of four —-but, if so, the country will have
40. Present indications are that there will be no
reduction of members and that Melbourne will have
to be satisfied with a scheme of representation under
which every 53 or 54 country electors will have as much
voting power as 100 city electors. It is idle to
theorise, because the country members have the votes,
and, further, only a Ministry with a decided country
tinge can live in Victoria. If Lawson remains in
power he will hold back his bill till November and
then try to whisk it through with the “Isn’t-it-wonder-
ful?” pose that he assumed in piloting the Anti-
Greenwood Licensing Bill seven months ago.
When Ryan took charge of Queensland
in 1915 he managed with seven salaried
Ministers, himself included. Now there are
nine, although the Leg. Council, which kept
one Cabineteer occupied, has been wiped out.
Victoria, which has twice the population of
Queensland, gets along with a Cabinet of
eight. South Aus. with one of six, Westra-
lia (305,000 sq. miles larger than Queens-
land) with the same, and Tasmania with
four. All have second chambers. Coyne’s
translation to the Land Court gave Theo-
dore an opportunity of relieving his over-
burdened State of at least one superfluous
Minister, but it wasn’t availed of. Labor
Governments never economise now in this
way. There are too many hungry mouths.
The more the statistics are studied the
less hope there seems for any sudden big
extension of the fruit-growing business in
Australia. The land that can be irrigated
at reasonable expense certainly ought to be
irrigated; but we shall have to look for some
other crop. As big an Australian problem
as any is how to prevent the appalling losses
of stock that occur when the periodical
drought hits the sheep and cattle country;
and we shall have to work out plans by
which the irrigable lands can be used to
save those beasts. They do something like
it in the U.S.A., where millions of head
break their rail journey from the dry south
to top up before they go on to Chicago. Aus-
tralian meat is getting the sniff of scorn in
the big markets because in an average or
worse season the bulk of it isn’t topped up
at all.
Part of Bananaland, if it didn’t go dry,
has at least decided not to get any wetter.
Thirteen electoral districts took a local-
option poll, and only three out of the Devil’s
number recorded their opinion that more
Bung was needed. A bare majority was no
use; the Act lays it down that unless 35
p.c. of the electors in a district vote, and
unless 60 p.c. of those voting favor more
licenses, the number of taverns must not
be increased. Viewed in that light the re-
sult might be considered comforting for
Cold Tea. It is certainly highly agreeable
to the existing Bungs.
After the trade-union conference in Eng-
land had enthusiastically turned down the
Communists, the heads explained that they
were going to work steadily towards nation-
alisation. And then Australia came into
the matter: the English leaders realised that
things had gone wrong there, and that the
peril of the State’s multitudinous servants
running the State would have to be reso-
lutely faced. Good men could be got to man-
age State enterprises, they believed; the
danger was not at the top, but at the bottom.
But that is only half the truth —or less
than half. State enterprises have broken
down in Australia not so much because “the
bottom” hasn’t done a fair thing, as because
of rotten political influences, especially in
the direction of overloading the enterprises
with interest on hopeless extensions.
Seabrook, the new man from Franklin
(Tas.), told the House of Reps, recently that
the raspberry-growers in his State had been
served with a demand for 255. a day and
keep from the gentlemen who sever the
berries from the plant. “On a good day,”
said the conqueror of McWilliams, “a man
will pick a hundredweight of raspberries, and
for that he asks 25 bob. When the owner
of the fruit carts it five or ten miles to the
factory he gets 18s. Bd. a hundredweight.
How is he to manage?” Nobody answered the
conundrum, but the matter might be adjusted
by the picker accepting five bob a day to
keep away from the job. The owner to be
allowed to have the fruit.
ON THE BREAD LINE.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“Australia has five and a half million people, and
half of them are starving, or on the bread line, any-
way.”—Lazzarini, M.Ii.R.
False he counts it as Gehenna that, compared with
(say) Vienna
Or with Moscow, we are lucky in our lot.
Time he deems it for an ending of this fatuous
pretending
We’ve sufficiency of tucker —when we’ve not.
Schedule this a Land of Plenty, would you ? Why,
there’s ten in twenty
Plunged in indigence as pitiable as
Any hapless mouse that searches for its sustenance
in churches
(He’s perfectly convinced of this, is Laz.).
Gently with the eggs and bacon, for, unless our
friend’s mistaken,
Bread and dripping may to-morrow be your fare.
Keep his grim assurance handy when you’re bolting
hashmagandy,
In a week you may be masticating air.
Every second human being on y-Gur daily path you’re
seeing
(Make a note of it!) the haziest notion has
When his teeth will next be meeting in the processes
of eating
(He’ll take his Bible oath to this, will Laz.).
Ponder deeply, nota bene, these remarks of Lazzarini
When to feel that times are middling good you’re
fain.
Score each morning with a red line that divides you
from the bread-line,
For you’re better fixed than one in every twain.
Quite a pleasant world men found it once until the
Deluge drowned it;
Now in famine’s face again we jest and jazz.
Ravens soon we may be needing, like the ones that
did the feeding
For Elijah, we Australians —teste Laz.

In nine of the twelve months the old Harri-
son, Jones and Devlin business helped earn-
ings. For it Goldsbrough-Mort paid £24,700
cash, took over £50,750 of mortgages on pro-
perties, and allotted 50,000 of its own £1
fully-paids. These shares were reckoned as
worth 355. each in the deal, and as the
assets transferred were taken into the books
at cost, the latest balance-sheet shows re-
serves to have been increased by £37,500 of
“share premiums.” Precisely the same re-
sult would have been obtained had the
shares been issued for cash and the proceeds
handed to the 11., J. and D. holder. One
feature of the transaction, and of the taking
credit for the “share premiums,” is that
Goldsbrough-Mort directors are evidently well
satisfied with the price they paid for the
business. The IL, J. and D. turnover of wool
averaged about 50,000 bales per annum, in
addition to which it had large handlings of
hides and skins and fat-stock. For the 12
months to March 31, 1921, Goldsbrough-Mort
sold 45,020 bales wool, and had a carry-
forward of 45,695 bales; for 1922, 120,493
bales were sold and 35,162 remained on hand.
Last year’s wool markets were so favorable
that 191,956 bales were marketed, and only
11,910 were on hand at March 31. Conse-
quently earnings took a big jump. In the
introductory table they are shown prior to
payment of debenture interest. A more ex-
plicit statement of results for the past six
years follows : —-

including £25,000 drought exes.
The outstanding feature of the comparison
is the leap taken by expenses last year, but
whether the whole of the increase was in-
curred on current operations is not quite
clear. Management exes., salaries, etc., were
£27,103 heavier than in the previous year;
the interest bill, apart from debenture
charges, but, of course, including nine
months’ interest on transferred mortgages,
was up £8562; and land- and income-tax
debits moved from £28,445 to £49,720. The
year’s expenses were no doubt swollen by
drought conditions; the co. is itself still a
big holder of station properties, and until a
couple of weeks back it looked as though
they were in for a bad time. The recent
splendid rains have entirely altered the out-
look.
In the 1921 financial year Goldsbrough-
Mort paid capital was increased by £143,839
by an issue of shares at ss. premium
(£35,960), and that issue and the purchase
of the H., J. and D. business have resulted
in considerable changes in the balance-sheets
since 1920: —

Other assets 64,105 39,925 44,528 43,808
The increase of liabilities is accounted for
chiefly by mortgages on properties and pre-
mises, most of them a legacy of the H., J.
and D. deal, though the co. itself apparently
mortgaged portion of its belongings during
the year to finance the purchase of a new
warehouse and undertake extensions of old
stores to provide “accommodation for all re-
quirements in Sydney.” Incidentally, pro-
perty interests now include an old city (Cir-
cular Quay) store which has been converted
into offices and shops, from which the co. ex-
pects to win remunerative rentals. Notwith-
standing the extensive property held, the
co.’s. liquid position is still very snug: at
March 31 cash, deposits and gilt-edged secu-
rities amounted to £703,152. Generally, the
co. is very strong: it was badly buffeted in
the ’nineties, and several reconstructions
were undertaken to place the business on
firmer foundations. Subsequently, when the
Commonwealth had made an astonishing re-
covery, it was found that values had been
written down too hard, and some of the fat
results which showed up later—and, inci-
dentally, provided bonus additions to written-
down capital—were the direct results of the
recovery of values. But the co. did not take
full credit for the appreciation: the directors
continued to write down the book values of
premises, which had been deeply cut into in
the reconstructions. No doubt there is a
Very substantial inner reserve attached to
those assets, and also in respect of back-
country holdings and the advances. Visibly
there are now reserves of £709,279 helping
£966,849 of paid capital. Under normal con-
ditions that gives splendid dividend-paying
possibilities, but the opportunities for share-
holders are brightened further by the inter-
minable debentures: there is £885,205 carry-
ing 4 p.c., and £593,823 carrying 5 p.c.. In
recent years the debentures have proved very
cheap funds.

The Automobile Insurance Co. of Aus-
tralia, Ltd. (Melbourne).- —This little co.
was floated last year by the Vic. Royal Auto-
mobile Club to handle members’ motor-car
and other risks, but outsiders have since
been permitted to take out with-profit poli-
cies. To date 10,910 shares have been sub-
scribed, but at the balance (April 30) paid
capital was £4870, in 5000 £1 prefs. paid
to 10s. and 4740 ordinaries similarly paid
up. The prefs. carry 8 p.c. cumulative, but
are to share point for point with ordinaries
in any distribution in excess of that rate.
Big divs. are not the objective, though ; the
A.I.C. was formed to handle select risks at
as near cost as practicable, and it was also
proposed that the Auto. Club should benefit,
in much the same way as the Vic. Chamber
of Manufactures has been helped by its in-
surance co.: the prospectus announced that
a proprietary co. had been formed for the
purpose of acquiring, by exhaustive ballot,
the share interest of individual members.
Premium rates have not been lowered, ex-
cept that business cars are placed on the
same basis as private ones (a reduction of
10 p.c. on usual rates) ; but the A.I.C.
“comprehensive” policy, besides sharing pro-
fits, provides additional benefits: (1) public
risk cover is unlimited; (2) repairs up to
£lO can be put in hand at once by the policy-
holder ; (3) 10 p.c. reduction is allowed if
owner only drives; (4) a similar allowance
if two cars are insured; and (-5) compensa-
tion during period of repairs. In the event
of total loss the amount insured is taken as
the replacement value, and for an extra £1
premium the following accident benefits are
covered : Death or loss of two limbs or both
eyes, £500; loss of one limb or one eye,
£250: and £7 per week for temporary total
disablement.
For the first year the management
adopted a conservative policy in respect of
retentions, and £5617 of total premiums of
£7329 were laid off for re-insurance or re-
turned, leaving £1712 net premium income.
Commissions and interest contributed £1742,
giving £3454 net revenue. Claims took £289
and exes. £2168. This left a surplus of
almost £lOOO, and the “profit,” after provid-
ing for unexpired risks (£703) and writing
off £7S of preliminary exes., was £216. The
prefs.’ 8 p.c. has taken £2OO. Last year the
co. re-insured four-fifths of car risks; during
the current year, capital having been in-
creased, the management proposes to lay-off
three-fourths, and to increase its retentions
as the co. grows stronger. Local Associated
underwriters have not taken kindly to the
venture: the Accident crowd point-blank re-
fused to admit it into their re-insurance
fold; the Fire underwriters have had an
application for membership in hand for 15
months and apparently refuse to come to a.
decision. The mutual principle in general
insurance is taboo. Consequently the A.I.C.
had to go abroad for re-insurance facilities,
but the management says they are of a “very
satisfactory nature”; in the Fire branch
cover is provided for 20 times the co.’s re-
tentions.
The A.I.C. was a clean float; there was
no consideration to vendors and preliminary
exes, took not quite £4OO. That account has
been written down to £320, and except it and
stationery and office equipment with a book
value of £506, the assets are a first-class lot.
The co. has made a good start, but, in view
of the numerous concessions provided under
policies, prospects depend entirely on the
claims experience. Still, as the A.I.C. is—or
believes it is-—handling selected risks only,
and the alliance with the Auto Club should
help business-getting and renewals costs,
there are possibilities.
The Sydney Automobile Club is also run-
ning an insurance scheme for its members,
but only as an agent for Lloyd’s; it under-
takes no liability itself. The Club failed
to secure special terms locally, but Lloyd’s
obliged with a one-fifth reduction of local
rates and also provided concessions similar
to many of those allowed by the Vic. co-op.
co. The arrangement is an excellent one
for the R.A.C.A.; its members not only
secure wider coyer, but “practically save
their club subscription” with the difference
in premium rates.

This little trustee co.’s shareholders are in
clover. A couple of years ago the directors
decided to provide a new home for the busi-
ness, and instead of selling gilt-edged invest-
ments to finance construction they deter-
mined to get in fresh capital. During the
past 12 months £9OOO has been raised, appa-
rently at a premium of 100 p.c., the net
amount taken into reserves having been
£8548. For the past half-year shareholders
received 10 p.c., together with a bonus of Is.
per share on 30,000 paid to 18s. each. The
div. rate works out at 21 1-9 p.c. p.a. But that
cannot be regarded as normal: in the past
Is.-per-share bonuses were made at alter-
nate half-yearly balances, and calls equal to
the bonuses were .made at the same time.
Paid capital was thus increased from £lO,OOO
£o £lB,OOO during the 10 years to 1919, but
since then all bonuses have gone into share-
holders’ pockets. Whether the latest bonus
is also a cash distribution is not disclosed
by the report. It is obviously a very snug
little business; but the high div. rates are
due wholly to the large reserves accumulated
over 30 years : after payment of latest divs.
and the bonus, reserves of. £34,712 were
helping £27,000 of capital. The following-
comparison shows how balance-sheet figures
have expanded over five and ten years
1913. 1918. 1923.

Meanwhile the trustee connection has grown

ing that abnormal conditions of the war
years and since have inflated capital
values, the little Westralian T., E. and A.’s
progress lias been rapid. Its success, and
the prospects of inducing many more better-
off' Westralians to trust their affairs to a
co. instead of an individual, have been re-
sponsible for the establishment of another
trustee co. in Perth.

Just prior to the war the Argus had the
care of £23,649. of deposits; but, owing to
Commonwealth borrowings and abnormal
conditions which made deposit money scarce
and dear, by 1921 only £13,404 was on hand.
Consequently mortgage business had fallen
off, though it had been revived a little by a
bank overdraft. During the past 12 months
the money-market became more favorable,
so the overdraft was displaced by new de-
posits, and the total in the account at April
30 was £27,391, £3700 more than in 1914.
Advances are now of record dimensions, and
the management is seeking more borrowers.
The larger business has so far had no influ-
ence on profits; but the society is making •
enough to pay 9 p.c. comfortably, and the
management probably hopes for better mar-
gins as money cheapens, though concessions
will, in turn, have to be made to borrowers.
Recent balance-sheet figures compare with
those of 1914 as follows:

Other assets . . 4,033 5,095 807 5,366
The £30,989 of liabilities at April 30 were
covered by assets with a book value of
£67,896. The Argus, by the way, was one
of the few building societies which came
through the Big Smash and was not forced
into drastic reconstruction. Heavy losses were
experienced, of course, but they were made
good out of subsequent profits, and nowadays
the society proudly announces each year that
its div. rate applies to “original” share capi-
tal. There are now reserves of £9657 help-
ing £25,000 of capital, and earnings of funds
accumulated in years when 7 p.c. was paid
wholly account for the better divs. which
have been distributed lately.

The opinions of a co. secretary:—
The proposal of the N. S. Wales Government that
all prospectuses shall be “passed” by competent
officials prior to being- issued is all to the good.
It is all very well to say “Why protect fools?” But
not only the simple are induced to put their money
into unsound or actually fraudulent flotations. The
hardest-headed business men are sometimes bitten.
One recent float was introduced by a prospectus con-
taining a deliberate misstatement with regard to
the business to be taken over, and among the prin-
cipal victims were two well-known bankers, a mer-
chant serving on Boards of several successful con-
cerns, and a hard-headed squatter. Had it been
necessary for the prospectus of that particular con-
cern to be “passed” by a competent independent
person prior to its issue, much trouble and money
would have been saved, as well as the reputations
of actually honest men who became involved.
But the most exacting care must be exercised in
selecting the individual who is to have the task
of investigating and passing prospectuses, and he
must be given full power to investigate all state-
ments made therein. A co. was successfully formed
not long- ago to exploit a patent, one object being to
sell the rights for other countries and to form a sub-
sidiary company to handle the Australian rights.
The promoter stated in the prospectus that the
rights of this invention for another country “had
been disposed of for £20,000.” Subsequently he
was asked to produce documents supporting the
statements. “Oh, we haven’t sold those rights yet,”
he replied. “A syndicate has been granted the
rights on a royalty basis for 12 months, and has
paid £lO for an option to pay another £lOOO
within four months for a further option to
pay £20,000 for the rights within 12 months.
I don’t say we’ve sold the American rights;
we’ve disposed of them.” I quote the case to
show that it is possible for a man, perhaps through
ignorance of his own language, to make a misrepre-
sentation innocently. A supervisor of prospectuses
would put a stop to this if he knows the English
language sufficiently well, and a man who has not
got that intimate knowledge might fall into a trap
similar to the one quoted.
There are, of course, numerous “snide” promoters
about; men who get their cos. floated and rake in
their interest, and against whom it would be. useless
to take, proceedings because they have practically
nothing to recover against. They can be put in gaol,
but that would be poor consolation for those who
have lost their money. Besides, no one likes to
acknowledge that he has been fooled, even if his
admission serves as a warning to others.
The result is that most promoters of new. cos. are
looked upon with suspicion, and the difficulties an
honest man meets in trying to get money into a
really good proposition are legion. The members of
the Stock Exchanges could assist very materially to
improve the present state of affairs, but they seem
apathetic. They are disinclined to bother with the
small float, no matter how sound it may appear.
If the aim of the Government is to restrict the
activities of the “crooks” and to keep an eye on
the prospectuses drawn up by persons who may mis-
represent without any idea of fraud, then the pro-
posals deserve nothing but commendation. The
activities of these people should be stopped whether
the necessary legislation be regarded as grand-
motherly or not. Honest promoters can have no
objection whatever to the restrictions proposed.
The N. S. Wales Government’s consideration
of Minister Ley’s proposal to regulate co.
promotions was prompted by the three-years’
boom in life-assurance floats. But that pro-
blem is being tackled from the wrong end;
the responsibility for whatever damage the
insuring and investing public sustains as a
result of the boom lies with the Common-
wealth Government, which promised, but
failed, to introduce legislation to control
life assurance. An effective Assurance Act,
incorporating the recommendations made 13
years ago by Royal Commissioners J. H.
Hood and G. H. Knibbs, would have made
most of the recent life floats impossible.

So far as the supervision of prospectuses
generally is concerned the Government will
be well-advised to keep out of the business.
Any examination of floats which could be
misinterpreted as an official endorsement
would place the Government in an awkward
corner. Nobody can guarantee the success
■of any co., no matter how sound the pro-
position may look on paper; so much de-
pends on doubtful factors —markets, a con-
tinuance of efficient management, and so on.

Vic. speculators have examined the Crown
mine (N.S.W.) and have acquired a large
parcel of reserve shares at a premium on the
flotation price, but at a substantial discount
Oh present market,values. A Melbourne man
has joined the Board, and a scheme of
development and equipment has been agreed
tO: It may take a year to bring the show
td the productive stage; meanwhile it may
be expected that there will be “something

sadly in want of a mining stock to play with.

Thb discovery of the Crown gold-mine
(N.S.W.) has directed attention to the
heglected Central-Western district as a field
fOr enterprise—gold in particular. There is
a hast extent of auriferous country extend-
ing from the coastal range west for, roughly,
a hundred miles, and a similar distance
nbrth.and south. Included in this area were
the, fichfest alluvial diggings in the State,
and alsd soinb highly productive reefs; but,
generally speaking, in reefing only surface
scratching has been attempted. A fair amount
of work has been done at places like Cope-
land, Hill End and Mitchell’s Creek (Wel-
lington), but elsewhere, in hundreds of favor-
able locations, it has been mere pottering.
Take the Hargraves field as an example. In
no other settled country in the world would
such an area of surpassing surface richness
have remained a desolation for 25 or 30
years. This belt is really the only large
one in the State which presents justifica-
tion for further prospecting. There is
marked activity just now, and prospecting
parties are being sent out by dozens, but the
professional lease-peggers are already much
in evidence, and unless the Mines officials,
who know them well, take steps to suppress
them, legitimate work may be blocked. The
latest report is of tbe discovery of a wide’
formation containing several lodes, all show-
ing gold values (with some high assays) at
the surface. The find is near Havilah, on
the Mudgee railway, Local prophets are
hoping that Biblical': history itself:
“The land of Havilah, where there is gold.
And the gold of that land is good,”

The latest N. S. Wales gold float is Vimy
Ridge, in 80,000 half-crown shares; 16,000
shares and £2750 cash go to vendors and
46,000 were offered for subscription. The
lore is in the mountains back o’ Bega, South
Coast, where a party of timber-getters struck
values in 1916 and’ delved with ind.fferent
success for five years. They gave up, and
the present crowd took over. Assays of from
lloz. to 9oz. have been got from costeens, and
30 tons won from shaft-sinking to 50ft. —it
has since been connected with a tunnel 190 ft.
in from the hillside —returned 3foz. per ton
at Kembla. Another shaft 130 ft. away is
down 36ft. on a 2ft.-lode said to carry 3-Joz.
C. R. Mackenzie, late manager of one of
the C.S.A. (Cobar) mines, likes prospects,
and the co. is putting in equipment and pro-
viding a water-supply to learn more about
the show. When the tunnel has been ex-
tended to a point beneath where 9|oz. assays
show in a costeen on the crown of the mount,
the co. expects to have 300 ft. of backs avail-
able for stoping, but tonnages and average
values are matters which only work can re-
veal.

Emmaville (N.S.W.), which _ was worked

Hampton Celebration, the ‘White Hope
(which Herbert Daly once broadcasted as
“one of Nature’s gold-mines”), and Golden
Hope are now the only three survivors of
the Hamilton boom. Celebration ore is being
treated at a loss, and the show would probably
close down only that some people expect that
better values will be got at depth. White
Hope has a treatment plant running on
stone of erratic value, and so far the syn-
dicate of Kalgoorlie and Adelaide mining
men who bouaht it has not shown
much profit. Golden Hope bought a battery
on t.-p. terms, and, according to official re-
ports, is about to crush its way to prosperity.
The purchase of a mill when little ore was
in sight and development was backward was
quite unwarranted. The procedure is inter-
preted by some people as the introduction
to another market gamble.

Mutooroo and Mutooroo Extended (now
known as Empire Extended) have again
appeared in the limelight as holders of new
Westralian options. The former has gone
to a notorious breeding-ground for wild-cats
30 miles from Laverton. Emp're Extended
has got hold of Devitt’s Reward, seven miles
north-west of Kalgdorlie, which from all
accounts appears to be quite unsuitable for
a co. In any case, Empire Extended, as at
present constituted, is too weakly financed to
undertake a progressive mining campaign,

Sons of Gwalia (W.A,) announces that its

New Blue (Bendigo) directors have hot
offered any explanation as to why the extta-
sanguine expectations ihdulged in at the last
meeting of shareholders have .been so sud-
denly shattered. It is stated, uhoffi^'a
that the depletion Of the reserves of the tick
eastern spurs at U?. ibOOft. ievei and the
discontinuance of the spurs iff the sdutherh
end of that level were the factors in the re-
cent decline in yields, and of share Valtte.s,
The disappearance of the bonanza veins iff
the south end cc.:’d hot have been foreseen,
but if facts are as stated it must have, beeil
obvious that there was iio rOsefve of rich
ore, and that it was being extracted as fast
as the drive progressed. These factors Could
not have escaped the attention of tire direc-
tors, and their failure to give this informa-
tion to shareholders demands explanation,
The position seems to have been adroitly
camouflaged right through; it is Only fToifl
four to six weeks ago that declines in the
yields were attributed to non-working of a
rich stope which was being filled in, whereas,
if current reports are reliable, the rich stope
was then exhausted. The co. has. large
reserves of low-grade ore, from which an
occasional div. ought to be possible, and
further exploration of the 1600 ft. formation
may disclose other bonanza veins. Further
possibilities must be deferred until the co.
goes down another lift and opens out a level
to ascertain if the 1600 ft. gold has gone
underfoot.

“Jasper”: If George Bryant says there
are OOOOsq. fathoms of wash developed in
the New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), will he
please indicate where they are? No one can
deny that Bryant knows the A-to-Z of Cathcart
and Cathcart Central; he had the luck to
wade in when B. M. and Co. dropped their
bundle after opening out the Cathcart gutter
on to the edge of a run of gold. The Cath-
cart boom didn’t bring wealth to all and
sundry, as veteran Harry Dodds can certify.
Cathcart Central, to the south of Cathcart,
was a bit of a wonder till the gold cut out
suddenly. Anyway, knowledge of the Cath-
parf and the Central isn’t knowledge of the
I.angi Logan gutter. It is the main lead into
which the Cathcart tributary drops, and it
doesn’t follow that, because a relatively
short stretch of a tributary gives gold, the
big main system will repeat honors. Some
wild things were screeched about the last
Duke United flatter, and one recollects what
was said about South Langi very much to
the detriment of New Langi. It is thrilling
to discover that the sow’s ear is really a gold
purse, though the general alluvial view is
that it is nothing of the kind.
* * * *
From “Old Alluvialist” :
A Langi Logan par. (B. 21/6/’23) suggested that
omission from the half-yearly report of any state-
ment as to what prospects have been revealed by
bores ahead of the wash drives “may or may not be sig-
nificant.” No bore has been put up into the wash for
12 months. They are now not necessary; as water
is in negligible quantity rises are put up direct
through the wash, and wash-drives are run out from
them. As to “Optic’s” statement (B. 14/6/’23)
that the 4oz. sample was got “in time for the
annual pow-wow” that value represented the aver-
age of six months’ deve’opment work. At the meet-
ing and in the reports it was stated that the most
southerly wash-drive was still giving 4oz. to the
fathom, so, after all, it was only keeping well up
to the average.

“H.S.S.”: “Viking” (B. 14/6/’23) says
that the North Long Tunnel, Walhalla
(Vic.), spent £lOO.OOO and got nothing, and
uses it as an argument against Cundy and
Hartrick’s opinions. As Hartrick is opera-
ting well west of any North'Long Tunnel
workings, he has had the benefit of that
£lOO.OOO spent by the old co. to tell him
where not to go. “Viking” apparently
doesn’t know the location of the New l ong
Tunnel’s ground. I was warden’s clerk
and min’ng registrar, etc., at Walhalla for
nearly 20 years, and watched the field rise
and fall. After many inspections I believe
that more than the “old-time miner” missed
it, but it’s there all the same.

W. L. BailFeu has been on the hunt in
North Queensland copper-fields, and has de-
c;dcd that the only way to d'spel the gloom
which has settled on the industry and on
Collins-street interests is to merge all the
payable shows and establish central treat-
ment works. Hampden-Cloncurry, on the
last report, looked like a squeezed lemon.
Mt. Elliott hasn’t a chance to get on unless
a railway connects it with Mt. Oxide. Mt.
Guthbert is financially defunct, and must
sooner or later drop into the Elliott or the
Hampden lap, unless its own creditors or
shareholders! buy it in a forced liquidation
deal. The settling of the problem means
much to North Queensland and also to
Collins House.

The Government bore at the Great North-
ern Extended is worth watching now. It is
approaching 600 ft., which is about the depth
geologist L. C. Ball considered that the con-
tinuation of the auriferous plumbago slates
would be met. Bands of plumbago have
been coming in below 500 ft., indicating that
his field work was nretty sound. Any reefs
Struck now in d filling are, under the con-
ditions applying to this field, likely to carry
good gold. The crux of the whole matter is
whether the reefs live as far north as the
site selected.
# # * *
Percy Meredith has located another reef
oil the Normaiiby field (Q.) for the Billy
Hughes Co. The latest is practically on the
line of the Bruce reef, which is reported to
be shaping well and has averaged 28dwt. by
sampling for 100 ft. along the level. Meredith
reckons that the new reef will yet restore
confidence in Normanby. It has not been
opened up enough so far to show how the
shoots rtin, or it they are likely to carry any
depth. Allowing for optimism, it should
average Ift. of quartz near the surface, and
sainples taken So far have averaged just over
the ounce; Meredith’s job now is to keep
the stdmps iii the expensive 10-head battery
from rusting, anfi he reckons the ore from
the new reef and the BrUce, with a little
high-grade ore front the Perseverance, should
just about do it.
* * * *
A Childers (Q.) syndicate is sinking a
bore for oil and gas, between that town and
Bundaberg, in sandstone and shale forma-
tion. Several holes have been put down
without results, but the deepest is now about
600 ft. and heavy water and several “shows”
of gas have been reported. A sample of the
latter was recently taken by the Government
Geologist for analysis, and boring is
hanging fire awaiting his verdict. Coal
occurs in the formation a few miles away, so
the presence of gas alone may indicate
nothing as to oil, although it is worth inves-
tigating.
* * * *
Returns from the Sardine, Kangaroo Hills
(N.Q. ), are coming in a little slower nowa-
days, and costs are mounting with increas-
ing depth. Although it does not show the ex-
tremely rich ore of the surface shoots, the
mine is still looking well, and the lode forma-
tion gives promise of going deep. How-
ever, the shoots are lenticular, and have to be
located by driving and sinking. Last month’s
crushing yielded 12 tons concentrates from
99 tons ore, an average much below the 25
to 30 p.c. formerly obtained. Production to
date has been 3095 tons for 700 tons of
black tin.

There is a stir in the Speck’s northern
mining camps-—and most mines of any con-
sequence are in that portion of the State —
over the Government’s proposal to transfer
the Launceston geological staff to Hobart,
and so, it is claimed, save £450 a
year. The Geological Survey and analyti-
cal staffs, together with a splendid labora-
tory, a fine library and comprehensive re-
cords, have been centred there for many
years, and the excuse for the change is alleged
to be that the Minister will be able to confer
more readily with his technical staff. But the
big mines on the west coast, the Mt. Lyell,
North Mt. Farrell, Magnet and Mt. Bishcoff,
will have over a hundred miles further to
send communications, with the attendant
waste of time. More than 1500 calls were
made upon the geologists in Launceston last
year, in addition to postal communications.
The general belief is that personal motives
are at the back of the change, and that geo-
logical director Loftus Hills’s successful fight
with his chiefs some months ago has not
been forgotten.
* * * *
Larut (F.M.S.) was floated nine years
ago to tackle 10J million yd. of pay stuff,
but since then nine million yards more have
been added, half of it of good average, but
the balance w r orth handling only if the tin
market is favorable. In six years to Decem-
ber last 5 856.060 yd. had been put through,
so there are still 9 million yards of average
grade ahead, with another millions con-
tingent on metal prices. The co. has had a
look at other areas, but boring results have
been very poor. Results for the past six
years have been as follows: —

General-manager John Cameron’s anticipa-
tions nine months ago that costs could be
reduced to were almost realised ; but the
average market price for the metal fell 1.21 d.
per yd. against the 0.9 d. saving in costs.
The year’s net profit, after providing £4340
for mine wastage and £3376 for depreciation,
was £11,113, and four sixpenny divs. (alto-
gether £10,000) were distributed. At Decem-
ber 31, after payment of divs., the co.
showed £31,153 of investments, cash and book
debts against total liabilities of £4lOB. In
March, following on better markets, another
6d. div. (£2500) was paid, and in May it
was decided to return £33,333 of capital, and
write down the shares from £1 to 13s. 4d.

Tupai and Kota (F.M.S.), twin offspring
of Larut, both entered the list of profit-
earners in their fifth year. At December 31
last the former had had its bucket-dredge
running six months: it treated 491,000 yd.
for 1991 tons tin (9.11 b. per yd.) worth
£19,713, equal to 9.63 d. per yd. Costs took
34d., and a profit of £10,923 was earned. A
first div. of 6d. was distributed (£2187), and
most of the balance was taken to reduce pre-
liminary and development accounts and to
write down plant. On March 15 another
sixpenny div. (£2500) was distributed. Kota
dredged for five months and put through
390,000 yd. for 911 tons, an average of only
slightly more than a half-pound. The dredge
started in an old lombong, and at first
handled a lot of old gravel-pump tailings;
but it has since moved into average ground.
The whole of the net profit of £2631 was
used to write down various accounts, but in
March Kota paid its first div.—a sixpenny
(£2500). Working profits for the first three
months of the current year were: Tupai,
£11,691 ; Kota, £8715.
Both cos. have fully called up their
£lOO,OOO nominal capital, and funds on hand,
together with the balance of tin-winnings
to June, chairman H. E. Pratten announces,
“are in the case of both cos. sufficient to pay
off all liabilities, including, if necessary, the
balance of their loan obligations to the
F.M.S. Government.” The two cos. have
joined in a £75,000 float —each taking up
20,000 fully-paids and 40,000 contribs. —to
dredge and reclaim 120 acres of pay ground,
most of the surface of which is now occupied
by natives. A contract for a plant with a
capacity of 100,000 yd. per month has been
let by this Settlements Dredge, Ltd., and pro :
duction should commence towards the end
of 1924.

“Edward Denman”: Sorry to spoil “The
Rumpus’s” yarn about Kanakas being paid
in kind and in cardboard tickets to Heaven
when he was a nipper on the canefields; but
as an employer of that class of labor from
early in 1872 to its abolition I am in a posi-
tion to say that Kanakas were never paid
that way for their work. From the earliest
days the law required them to be paid in
“gold” at the end of their term of service
and before a stipendiary magistrate; at a
later period they were
paid every six months in
gold before a Govern-
ment official known as a
Protector. Even at the
present day when they
are free laborers and re-
ceive the award rate for
sugar-workers, viz., 16s.
Bd. per diem, their wages
have to be paid before
an officer of police, and
only a few weeks ago a
number of employers
were prosecuted by the
Government for failing
to comply with that re-
quirement. That quite a
number of Kanakas in
the early days did re-
ceive bits of cardboard as
alleged passports to
Heaven I am well aware,
but these assuredly didn’t
come from their employ-
er s. This particular
swindle was worked by
certain individuals who,
while professing the deep-
est concern about the eternal welfare of the
Kanakas, managed to make it a source of
profit to themselves as well. Actually, the
charge for the said “passports” was not 10s.
but £5.

“The Magpie”: Reference was made re-
cently to the luck of a pearler at Broome
(W.A.) some years ago in being able to re-
cover a beautiful gem that had fallen over-
board into a good many fathoms of water.
I was living in Broome at the time, and well
remember the rustle the affair caused. An-
other piece of good luck of a somewhat simi-
lar nature came the way of a Westralian
ploughman the other day. A Tammin farm-
hand, happy in anticipation of the day next
month when he could call the nicest little
girl in the world his wife, felt at his belt
for the pouch containing 120 of the best
(no bank should be trusted with that lot)
the wherewithal to furnish the cottage the
boss was having built for him. To his horror
he discovered a hole in the pouch, and not
one of the notes left. An SOS brought
four mates to his assistance, and it took
those five men two days to re-plough and
cultivate the already-well-ploughed land. But
they found every one of the notes.

A faithful spouse stands up for her husband. She

Many a rich uncle’s grave is planted only with

“Whitehall”: No post-war change is more
noticeable than that which has occurred in
governors. The pre-war governor, even
when not an autocrat, never cheapened him-
self. His attitude was the slightly arrogant
one of the artist with something to sell; the
State needed him, and if it wasn’t prepared
to put up with his little ways—well, there
were plenty of other places that would. So
Australia got Don Juanesque governors,
whisky-soaking and tradesmen-bilking gov-
ernors, and governors who delegated their
ridiculous duties and went away fishing or
shooting for weeks at a time. Many reached
after powers of veto to which they had no
righ>. and in the inevitable row took up
a high-handed attitude. The modern gov-
ernor is aggressively domesticated: he pays
his bills and takes discount for cash : he is
no more political than a brass owl. But he
defers to shady profiteers, and in his desire
to be applauded by all classes he carries on
more like a fading vaudeville star than any-
thing else. This tendency to adulate the
rich (w T ho were rather spurned in the Vic-
torian epoch, but are the despots of the
modern world) and to be as humble and
friendly and joyous as a poodle, is to be seen
also in kings and their heirs. It is a grim
OF ONE MIND.
“Ah well, I’m glad we agree about one thing.”
“ I’m not so sure that we do.”
“Oh, dearest, don’t you still think I’m rather nice-looking!”
portent. The monarchical ship is in one
of the most threatening storms of its long life,
and all hands are on deck, down to the small-
est State-Governor cabin-boy..

“Nugget”: Some of our N. S. Wales edu-
cational authorities, following a Victorian
lead, have been expressing approval of the
possibilities of the much-advertised “Dalton
Plan” for training the young idea. I would
like to detail the result of my one and only
experiment in this line. Recently, finding
myself with two jobs on my hands at once,
I removed a small
senior class of boys
to another part of
the building, indi-
cated the lesson I
required them to
become acquainted
with, and ex-
tracted a promise
from them to do
what they could
and bring their dif-
ficulties along for
explanation. Appa-
rently there were
no difficulties, so I
went to see what
progress had been
made. I found that
a stray cur had wan-
dered into the pass-
ageway, and that
two boys were
bombarding hi m
with paper pellets
from catapults.
Three others were
busy preparing am-
munition for the
artillerymen. Of
the remaining three
boys two were fol-
lowing the adven-
tures of Nelson
Lee; the last of
the Daltonians was
decorating the title-
page of his science
notebook with the
representation of a
gallows and a sus-
pended malefactor
—probably myself.
I am inclined to
think the new fad
will be entirely
popular with the majority of our young
Australians.

“Saxby”: A German applicant for natu-
ralisation was taking the oath of allegiance in
the Coonabarabrari Court House (N.S.W.).
In repeating the oath given out by the P.M..
he encountered many verbal hurdles, but cheer-
fully crashed through them all, until the
magistrate dictated, “Say T renounce my
allegiance.’ ” The Teuton gulped at this
requirement, hesitated, and at length gabbled
something unintelligible, as if in compliance.
The P.M. demanded that he repeat the
words distinctly. Seeing there was no
escape, the German took a deep breath, and
said mournfully: “Ah, veil, ‘I renounze my
religion!’ ”

“The Mug,” with acid on his pen:—
I suppose we shall have to wait for Bean’s story of
the 1916 campaign to get an official statement of the
Fifth Divvy’s losses at Fleurbaix (B. 28/6/’23). But
a man who left an arm there assures me they were,
in round numbers, 7200, and that when the enemy
reported that he had counted 2000 dead Diggers on
his wire and thereabouts he told the mournful truth.
The Fifth was a bit older on the average than the
two divisions that went abroad in 1914. It was com-
posed largely of men in the early thirties, and a very
high proportion of them were bushworkers who
had had to travel weeks to reach a recruiting depot,
and farmers who had been prevented from enlisting
earlier by the failure of the 1914 harvest, and who
waited until they had put in their 1915 crop. When
they joined up no one could mistake the war for a
cheap excursion to Europe. They trained faithfully
for about 16 months, and by the summer of 1916 were
in the pink of condition. And then to be hurled to
destruction in a mad manoeuvre that never had the
slightest chance of success—a stunt so utterly futile
that its failure was written in blood on hundreds of
shattered bodies five seconds after the hop-over! The
unforgettable, unforgivable tragedy of it!

“1465”: What is regarded by the M.L.
police as a particularly smart coup has been
brought off by two constables in Christ-
church. Stealthily covering their move-
ments, they bore down on the Canterbury
Museum and seized a number of ancient
firearms. These consisted of arquebuses,
blunderbuses, muskets, flintlocks, matchlocks
and boarding pistols, some of them of great
age. It is questionable whether the best of
them ever went off as furiously as the autho-
rities are doing at having to register them
under the Arms Act —a precautionary mea-
sure insisted upon by the guardians of public
safety!

“Clerk”: Chapel-street, Pra’n, is on Fri-
day nights the scene of dire forebodings and
black prophecies. Numerous street preach-
ers, stationing themselves in favorable posi-
tions, word the erring multitude and tell of
Sodom and Gomorrah. One of them is the
retired nigger pug Savral, who deals out
evangelistic arguments as heartily as he de-
livered stoush 20 years ago. The crowds
seem to listen attentively, but there is no
sign yet of a religious revival in Chapel-
street. Last Friday night one shrill-voiced
preacher, surrounded by a fair push, queried
vigorously: “And, dear friends, if our
Lord were to come down to earth this night
AN EASY ONE.
“How is it that whenever I come home early I find you with that
bounder of a Jack?”
“Simply because you never ’phone to say you are coming, dear.”
amongst us, what would He say?” It was
apparently a Richmond football barracker
who felt himself impelled to try to answer
the question in the local vernacular. “Eat
’em alive!” he ventured enthusiastically.

SHOWING THEM HOW: A LEGEND OF SYDNEY
TOWN HALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Ball to be thoroughly ‘nice.’ No claret cup.
Only beer. Nothing artists can throw about —such
as pickles. No ham or bacon-fat. No onions.
Tickets only to be sold through the committee-
women. —From Artists’ Bail rules drafted by Society
ladies with the object of saviny the artists from
themselves.
Sydney’s “Bal des Quatz Arts” was a moral affair,
For none except provedly “nice” folks was there;
An excellent reason for which fact was this:
No persons were franked to the ball’s refined bliss
With a Socialist’s sneer,
Or a pirate’s tense leer,
Or that odd evening wear
In which oafs sometimes dare
The smiles of their betters to brave on first nights,
Or ’neath a jazz restaurant’s critical lights.
In many respects it was much like the halls
That Sydney has known since it first boasted halls.
The Swillerton family turned up in force.
Fred offered to fight, as a matter of course.
And wept when he found he’d been misunderstood
(Wept loudly and long, as a gentleman should),
Then fell on the floor
By the supper-rocm door,
While his brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces
All joined in expounding the family thesis:
That old Fred, though no doubt in a pitiful pass,
Didn t drink like a drunk of the laboring class.
And Bulgewiek broke into the Lord Mayor’s flat
With Mrs. lioobooze and some fizz—and that’s that.
And dear old Fred Swillerton got up again,
And was hit on the nose, and in terror and pain,
Fled moaning- the echoing corridors through.
All, in short, was the same as at functions that you
Have attended, no doubt, in the days of your youth—■
Neither better nor worse, if one must tell the truth—
Save in this: the official supply of good cheer
Was, in Purity’s name, confined strictly to Beer.
The McLifters from Carryorf station were down,
While the Grabbes represented the culture of town.
They had been at the hop on the Fuchsia the night
All the ward-room plate went. (It has not come to
light,
And neither have Lady O’Rafferty’s furs,
From that day to this.) The unmerited slurs
Cast on poor old Jim Grabbe
( Who was seen in a cab
At the Man-o’-War Steps
With his nephew Bill Epps
And a large bag or sack)
Showed a singular lack
Of that name for good manners and niceness of taste
One’s accustomed to grant to (or should one say
waste
On?) such leaders of fashion, far-famed through
the State,
As the Carpes—who accused Jim of pinching the
plate.
ADVICE TO THOSE ABOUT TO MARRY.
In the Spring a young man’s faney
Lightly turns to thoughts of love.
BOTH (honeymooning on the Mountains):
“Next time I’ll wait until the Spring.”
No scandal of this kind the Artists’ Ball tarnished:
Not so much as a fork or a spoon went astray.
( All the portable goods which the supper-room gar-
* nished
llad been firmly chained down in the course of the
day.)
And no one threw onions, fresh, roasted or pickled,
And no one on jettisoned sandwiches fell,
Though down many dowagers’ backs soda trickled
From siphons whose squirters had worked all too
well.
no one on playfulness bent lacked those missiles
Which guests at'smart parties delight to exchange.
(What odds if no ham through the heated air
whistles,
When butter is equally good at close range?)
To conclude: the affair was a howling success,
Conducted throughout, as remarked by the press,
“On the ‘nicest’ of lines.’’
In fact, but for the wines
(Which, as previously noted, were not to be had,
Whether sparkling or still, red or white, good or
bad)
In no single respect was it unlike those dances
Where Society privately shuffles and prances.
And even in this it could fairly compare
With the rest —not a trace of an artist was there.

“Haka” : I knew it was only a matter of
time when Henare would hand out some-
thing distinctly refreshing in divorce testi-
mony. His chance came the other day be-
fore a M.L. judge. In giving evidence he
explained to the court that the trouble
started on the honeymoon, when his wahine
insisted on sleeping in her skirt.
“Tin Hat”: Here is a fine example of
the absurdities and anomalies of our patch-
work divorce laws. In Melbourne recently
a woman sought a decree of nullity of mar-
riage on the ground that her second husband
was the brother of her (deceased) first one,
and that, under the old English laws adopted
by this country, she was entitled to have the
union declared void. The plea, it turned
out, was good, but while the injustice to
the children of such annulled marriages has
since been recognised in England, and the
law amended, the amendments have never
been copied into the law of Victoria. In
view of the fact that the decree sought would
automatically render the children of the
second marriage illegitimate, Irvine, C.J.,
intimated his intention of trying to find some
point of judicial discretion under which he
could avoid granting the relief sought. Surely
nothing worse could be said against any law
than that the Chief Justice of a State openly
admits that he is seeking for means by which
it can be evaded, so that justice will not
miscarry.

“DoubtingT.” : Sydney may console itself for
the loss of the Federal capital when it learns
that it has been selected for an even higher
distinction. It was in Adelaide I heard about
it: I was dragged by a relative to a Theo-
sophist meeting, where I heard a soulful per-
son, armed with a plan and many impressive
sets of figures, expatiating on the construc-
tion of “a magnetised centre to be used when
the Lord comes.” He explained that this was
to take the form of an amphitheatre, to be
erected on a Sydney beach (I have since
heard that the foundation-stone has been
laid at Balmoral). The seats will be en-
graved with the names of the faithful wffio
subscribe adequate sums for such a privilege.
The promoter indicated on the plan the exact
spot where “the Lord” is expected to stand
and deliver the message. Prices of seats
range from £lOO in the front to £lO at the
back; some of the audience paid instalments
and undertook to come along with more be-
fore the booking-office closes. The Second
Coming, one gathered, is due about three
years hence.
“Anglian”: Despite some recent bouquets
the Ghoorka has been getting, I suggest that
his military utility was strictly limited. I
often came into personal contact with him
on Gallipoli at the time of the Suvla Bay
affair. The prevailing opinion amongst the
Australians was that he was a tolerable
soldier at all times, and a specialist at silent
night attacks. It was said that his method
at close quarters was to seize his adversary’s
bayonet with one hand prior to putting in
some gory work with his own “kukri.” With
regard to the bayonet-seizing, a large pro-
portion of Ghoorkas certainly carried ban-
daged left hands—and cheerful grins.
PREFERRED HIM ON THE SKY-LINE.
“On what grounds does your father object
to Billy?"
“On any within a mile of our house.”
AFTER THE REFUSAL.
“Teddy, don't take it to heart. There's lots
of nice girls around —Mobs and Ethel and
Sue, for instance. Any one of them would
make you a better wife than I.”
“Yes, I know, darling. But I asked them all before I came to you.”
“Titun” : They used to have a novel cala-
boose at the irrigation settlement of Nyah
West, near Swan Hill (Vic.). When any
citizen had beered not wisely but too well,
he was taken off and put in an abandoned
wheat-stripper, the door of which was then
wired down to prevent his escape. To make
doubly sure that he wouldn’t be a gaol-
breaker the drunk was searched before being
locked up in case he happened to have a tin-
opener about him.

“Peter II.”: David Cairns, of Flinders
(Vic.), who sustained a complete fracture of
his neck in 1897, continued to live and uo
his job until a couple of weeks ago. A
cousin of mine had an even closer call. On
a winter’s day 15 years ago, while living at
Marrickville (N.S.W.), he fell into Cook’s
River. He could not swim, and when
dragged from the icy water was apparently
dead. Artificial respiration was not prac-
tised so universally then, and he was left
till a doctor arrived. After examination the
doc. declared life extinct, and the lad was
taken home. Next day, after arrangements
had been made for the funeral, his grief-
stricken mother, for some reason which she
could never explain, warmed the white
stockings before she put them on him. The
“corpse’s” eyelids twitched. A neighbor
who was assisting in the laying-out quickly
rolled him into hot blankets instead of his
coffin. It’s still empty.

“O. McKay M.”: I submit that Sydney
can show a law case quite as interesting in
its way as “J.E.’s” prize curiosity (B.
21/6/’23) , the Irish suit anent the postage-
stamp. The original dispute was all over a
penny, and yet it took the Privy Council to
finalise the litigation. One Robertson de-
cided to cross the harbor, and accordingly
paid his fare (Id. it was then) and gained
access to the jetty. Then he changed his
mind and decided to forfeit his entrance-
money. But the man at the gate refused to
let him out until he had paid return fare
according to the Balmain Ferry Co. s rules.
Robertson regarded the demand as prepos-
terous and declined to pay. Thereupoh he
was detained —until he escaped through a
hole in the fence. He brought action against
the ferry co. for false imprisonment, and,
unable to obtain any redress in the local
courts, finally appealed to the House of
Lords [Robertson v. Balmain Ferry Co.,
1910, Appeal Cases, p. 295]. But he fared
no better here.' The decision was given
against him on the ground that his deten-
tion was not “imprisonment” within the
meaning of the Common Law, as he could
have escaped by swimming.
“Tauwarra”: Old Joe, from the Yodda
(Papua), didn’t like Port Moresby. “No
good ter me,” he explained as he made for
the bush. “It’s too flamin’ ’ot, yer ain’t got
a decent water-supply, and the company’s
rotten. Come ter think of it,” he added,
“them’s the only objections I’ve got ter
hell!”

“U.P.” : The South Aus. Government intends
spending £25,320 in increasing the salaries of
1807 underpaid school-teachers. jaeut.-Col.
Tom Smeaton, ex-M.L.A., now secretary of
the Public Teachers’ Union, says this will
mean an average rise of about 10 per cent.:
but even then the salaries will not be equal
to those paid in the other States, with the
exception of Tasmania. Meanwhile, W. T.
McCoy, the South Aus. Director of Educa-
tion, is inspecting educational institutions in
the United Kingdom, and has announced that
of the 70 British school-teachers required
for South Aus. 62 have been chosen and
had their passages booked for them. There
never was a case in which poor pay was
more directly responsible for the shortage
of labor, and if anybody except a Government
imported men to take the place of those who
are not there because the wages didn’t at-
tract them, the welkin would be split by the
shriek of protest.
“Ratio”: “Cartot’s” statement (B.
28/6/’23) that statistics available to him
show that the average height of males in
Australia is rather less, than sft. 3in. is
incredible. For a man this is a dwarfish
height, and his statement means in effect
that the average Australian is almost a
dwarf. Further, if that were the average
height, there would have to be a consider-
able number of men below that height to
offset those measuring fi’om sft. 3in. upwards
w r ho are obviously numerous. lam sft. 6in.,
have always considered myself on the short
side, and am frequently described in that
way for identification purposes. According
to “Cartot’s” statistics I would be three
inches over the averhge height. I suggest
that either the statistics he talks about are
hopelessly unreliable or else they refer not
to the average height of males, but to that
of both sexes together. In that case they
may be somewhere near the mark.
•* * * »
“Costs”: “Lex” (B. 21/6/’23) suggests
that when a husband and wife, neither with
clean hands, are on opposite sides in the
divorce court, any amicus curiae who con-
vinced them of the wisdom of a collusive
arrangement would be their truest friend.
Oddly enough, this is exactly what an uncon-
ventional S.A. Judge, now dead, did once
propose to those concerned, with a fine dis-
regard for the Law Society and professional
etiquette. A husband charged his wife with
unfaithfulness, and she countered with simi-
lar allegations. There was abundant evi-
dence of both offences, and there was a
grown-up or growing family concerned, pro-
viding all the more reason for a seemly dis-
solution. The wife was weighing-in with
the usual claim for alimony pending suit
before the Judge in chambers, when his
Honor suggested that if the alimony were
made permanent at the outset, and if it were
sufficiently liberal, the wife might be in-
clined to —er —take a different view of the
husband's claim. The solicitors, on this
hint, immediately conferred to try to devise
a draft settlement, but professional keen-
ness and distrust over-reached itself, and at-
tempts were made to incorporate conditions
which vitiated the whole scheme. In the
end either the lady changed her mind, or
some busybody “blew the gaff,” the Crown
Proctor foolishly “intervened,” and the whole
sordid evidence was ventilated publicly at
great length ; the settlement being set aside
as collusive. The result, after appeals to
the Full Court and High Court, was pre-
cisely the same as in the recent Howland
case in Sydney, with everybody “as yon
were,” except, of course, Costs, who was
fattened with fees from both sides.
"T P.”: My own experience of medical
inspection of’ Vic. State schools convinces
me that those who instituted it deserve the
warmest commendation. I have seen 500
Australian kiddies lined up ready for over-
hauling—two of the doctors were women —*
and watched them marching home to dad
and mum with written recommendations as
to their health requirements, if any. After
the parents had been given a chance to
tackle the problems, a “follow-up” nurse ap-
peared on the scene. In one case, where a
poor widow with eight in family was at her
wits’ end to find food and clothing for the
tribe, the nurse took off a couple, one to
a general hospital for an operation for aggra-
vated adenoids, the other to an eye and ear
institution. The business concluded, she
returned the kids to a grateful mother. In
Melbourne Drs. Janet Greig and Eileen Fitz-
Gerald and Dr. Hayward have for months
done glorified slumming work through schools
in the poorest areas —good luck to them.
Occasionally one sees adverse criticisms of
some point in the scheme; but when one
remembers that in Victoria there are but
three doctors available for the work, the
critics might well be lenient. The only fault I
have to find with the scheme is that, it is
not extensive enough. What is needed is the
strengthening of the medical inspecting staff
and the addition of a dozen “follow-up”
nurses. >6
“T. 0.1.” takes a backward glance: —
Robert Russell arrived in Sydney in 1832 and be-
came attached to the Public Works Department as
Assistant Town Surveyor under Felton Mathew. The
first surveyor at Port Phillip was Robert Hioddle, a
principal surveyor under Major T. L. Mitchell, Sur-
veyoi'-General, and he had as a colleague Assistant-
Surveyor W. R. Govett, of “The Leap.” Under
Hoddle’s direction Russell, Darke and D’Arcy made
up the survey party, D’Arcy being draftsman. The
first land sale was held on June 1, 1837, in Mel-
bourne. R. S. Webb, Customs officer, received the
deposits and Hoddle was the auctioneer. The Bank
of Australasia corner (a half-acre originally) was sold
to Bowerman, of Sydney, for £B7. Thinking he had
bid too much he forfeited his deposit and left for his
home, which he did Hot reach, the little vessel
ASPIRATIONS.
NEWLY-RICH (to music-master) : “Chopin be
jiggered! Listen to me, 'Earietta's got,
bonza arms; an' I just leant yer to put
'er on to some flash stunt so's she can
show 'em off a bit!"
which bore him foundering on the voyage. A son of
Bowerman was a police magistrate in Banaiialand, but
later got into bad trouble for assaulting Under-
secretary Manning, brother of W. M. Manning, the
knight. After a dozen years he was released, and,
failing to get settled employment, suicided in Sydney
Domain. A special Act was passed giving Manning
a pension of ,£6OO a year for life —the surgeons said
he could not live six months, and he lived for 40
years! The Methodists got the bank corner at
Bowerman's bid, and built a primitive chapel on the
back of the allotment. In the early 'sixties they
sold for £40,000, and built Wesley Church in Lons-
dale-street. When I knew Robert Russell he lived in
Hoddle-street, but later he got into Victoria-parade.
Hoddle, D'Arcy and Webb bought lots early, but
Russell’s name does not appear in the lists. He died
at 93 on April 10, 1900.

ders and tired eyes. But he owned an alert
mind, and almost devilish industry. Long
ago he put the Post Office Savings Bank on
its feet; then Seddon beckoned him to the
job of Public Trustee, and not long after-
wards he became Auditor-General. A lonely,
remote man, he had only one relaxation-
walking from his home to his work. The old
man leaves behind a most honorable record
of responsible duty to the State discharged
with unwavering fidelity. He was the real
founder of the Maoriland Advances to
Settlers Office, the first of its kind in the
world—it was he who put into John McKen-
zie’s hands the scheme which John noisily pre-
sented as his own invention. At the end
the marker said 81. And all done on veget-
ables and water and without matrimony.
“Nor’-West” : It’s a tough breed all right.
George Bowden, of Walcha (N.S.W.), this
year dipped single-
handed 500 big
wether s. The
sprightly lad mod-
estly admits to SO
summers. Again,
Bill Collins, o f
Tent Hill, was
born on Deepwater
station shortly
after that squat-
tage was taken up
by the Windeyers,
and when he grew
up a bit he was for
a time manager of
Bolivia station. He
is only 84 now,
and with the pre-
cocity of youth
makes a hobby of
shoeing heavy
draught-horses.
"OLD JACK”
WEST, Labor
M.H.R. for East
Sydney, who was
one of the first to
get into trouble
with the Chair in
a recent wild all-
night sitting.
For 15 years onward from 1894 A. P.
Stewart, who died in Sydney last week,
had one of the rottenest jobs in Australia.
The old A.J.S. Bank, which had smashed,
had never owned the pluck to tell creditors
how bad things really were; and Stewart
was its chief inspector until 1907, when
he was appointed general manager. Lie set
to work at once to clean up the mess, and
produced the scheme which, with slight modi-
fications, formed the basis of the now very
prosperous A.B.C. In the years between
A. P. Stewart got the reputation of being
like flint. But he was nothing of the sort:
he was really a shy student, with a lot of
artistic feeling. A Bulletin man, who had
to see a good deal of him while the recon-
struction was being hatched, found him one
noon, after a distracting morning, giving his
brain a rest by stringing light verses to-
gether. He was a sound authority on bank-
ing law, and wrote a book or two for young
bankers’ use. An irregular but valued Bul-
letin contributor, he was most concerned
in recent years in trying to put land settle-
ment on a better footing, and was hotly
opposed to loading up inexperienced men
with debt. Incidentally, he was an old
friend of Rolf Boldrewood, who drew him
as Charles Stirling in his yarn “Nevermore.”
He was 83 at the end.
Died in England, L. R. (“Bob”) Davies,
well-known in Australia between 1890 and
1900. He was his dad’s right-hand man, and
their firm, Bailey, Davies and Wishart, fash-
ioned the viaducts on the Melbourne railway
line, and the Stephens Creek dam at Broken
Hill. Later, they went to Westralia, and
ran the M. C. Davies Timber Co., merged
afterwards in Millar’s. They also had, and
still retain, considerable Westralian cattle
business. Major “Karri” Davies is a
brother, as are Frank and Arthur Davies of
Westralia. Bob went to live in England a
quarter-of-a-century ago. His only son (born
in Adelaide) was killed in the war.
Frank Brennan (Q.), who was a central
figure in the “bribe” case a few months ago,
had his share in the return of the Theodore
Government to the Treasury benches. He
gets his reward in the job of Assistant-Home
Secretary. Brennan is the only lawyer in
the Q. Labor party. He was born in Mary-
borough in 1884, and while at the local
Grammar School was under T. J. Ryan, who
was classics master. He qualified to chase
Costs in 1912, and six years later won the
Toowoomba seat from the leader of the Oppo-
sition, Jas. Tolmie.
“The Patriarch”: John Nevin, the new
vice-president of St. Pat.’s Ecclesiastical
College, Manly, has another decoration be-
sides his D.D. and D.C.L.—the coveted
French Croix de Guerre avec Palmes. He
earned it under fire as a chaplain to an Eng-
lish regiment. A badly wounded leg that
had to be amputated was Fritz’s contribution
at the affair. Nevin was educated at Propa-
ganda College, Rome, under Australia’s
Apostolic Delegate, Cattaneo, and later be-
came Propaganda’s assistant vice-rector.
“Eddyson” : The Ballarat statue to Peter
La lor, which has just been unveiled, , is a
monument to the fact that nothing ma.f suc-
ceed like failure. The bronze stands for Eureka
as well as for Peter, and Eureka was an ill-
considered, badly-conceived, wrongly-exe-
cuted, wholly foolhardy disturbance, the par-
ticipants in which, on the popular side, in-
cluding Peter himself, were emphatically
wiped out after half-an-hour’s scrapping in
the dawn of a (Sunday morning, Dec. 3, 1854.
Peter himself escaped, badly winged, com-
pleting the fiasco. But emphatic success fol-
lowed on failure. Practically all that was
asked for was conceded as the result of popu-
lar demonstrations against Hotham and his
myrmidons. But in this triumph Aspinall
and David Blair and other champions of
popular liberties took conspicuous part, and
these men deserve rather more than lion,
mention in connection with a Eureka statue.
They should at least have figured in bas-
relief about the pedestal, assuming that
Ballarat is commemorating the revolution-
ary movement and not merely honoring Mr.
Speaker Lalor, the stern constitutionalist
who, having secured a measure of govern-
ment of, by and for the people, became one of
the most law-abiding and law-sustaining of
politicians.
Maurice Alexander Cohen, 8.A., who died
in Sydney the other day at 73, was a fine,
simple-minded old Hebrew. He landed here
34 years ago, and ever since then had been
imparting to young Abraham and Isaac the
learning upon which Jewry relies to main-
tain the idea of Israel as “a peculiar people.”
Ana rich Jews at whose houses he supped
considered themselves honored.
A. P. Kennedy, who went down with the
Sumatra, near Port Macquarie (N.S.W.),
was a 34-year-old Maorilander who learned
engineering with the Adelaide S, S. Co., and
was on the Matunga when she was captured
by the raider Wolf. After the war, rather
than wait for slower repatriation, he worked
his way back from Germany, and later took
the job of chief engineer on the Sumatra—
which, incidentally, was a German (New
Guinea) coasting craft when the war started.
Hugh Murdoch, who died in Hobart lately,
at 64, was grandson of Dr. James Murdoch,
who came to the Speck in 1822 and combined
medicine with farming on a 800-acre grant
near Richmond. Hugh’s father was a miller,
and had the credit, rightly or wrongly, of
importing the first Californian thistles into
Tas. mixed up in some oats. Hugh Mur-
doch stuck to milling all his life, and though
there are three of his brothers, James, Peter
and Thomas, in the Speck Parliamejit, he
never had the political itch. Or perhaps he
thought the family had done enough in that
line.
The Last Post has sounded for Francis P.
Killeen, who only a couple of months ago
resigned his job as sec. of the Limbless and
Maimed Soldiers’ Assoc, in N. S. Wales to
become an organiser for the Australian
Cotton Assoc, in Queensland. He had long
service with the A.1.F., and came out of it
with a commission and wounds. For the
“stumpies” he was a fierce fighter, anj did
great things for them.
Albert Frederick Calvert, company-pro-
moter and author (of sorts), has received
some more notoriety in London in connec-
tion with a lawsuit brought by a sister ot
the last Russian Czar, who had been induced
to part with jewels valued at £lO,OOO. The
Judge drew some pointed inferences from
the fact that defendant, although stigma-
tised as a thief, had refused to go into the
box; ’s Honor announced that he was send-
ing the papers to the Public Prosecutor.
Calvert was fairly well known in Australia,
especially on the Western side, 30 years ago.
He was an intrepid explorer then—on the
strength, apparently of a journey in a buggy
from Roebourne to Marble Bar. He floated
several cos. during the gold boom—with
negligible results to investors—and between
whiles published half-a-dozen books about
Westralia, and one about Australian explora-
tion generally. They are not devoid of value,
either.
James Holden, who was born at Parra-
matta (N.S.W.) when Governor Bourke
lived there, died recently in Melbourne. His
parents went to Port Phillip in 1849, the
voyage occupying three weeks. The Holdens
settled at Geelong, and in 1866 James
selected 214 acres which became the nucleus
of the big Overdale Estate, near Stawell, of
which he was the owner when he went over
the hill, aged 91.
Stopford, Bananaland’s new Home Secre-
tary, represents Mt. Morgan. He has an
agile tongue and much popularity. For
years he was boss of the Public Works Com-
mission, and travelled up and down the
State a lot. Like Theodore, McCormack and
Jones, he was once a miner.
HANS HEYSEN, the water-colorist, in the
presence of Nature.
G. E. Piesse, of Bridgewater (Tas.), the
pioneer breeder of Shropshires in the Speck,
passed out a few days ago. He laid the
foundations of his stud with importations
from England. Another well-known sheep-
man, Norman Nicolson, has also gone out.
He was born at Campbelltown (Tas.) in
1856, and owned the Streanshalh estate by
the Macquarie River, where he was a suc-
cessful breeder of merinoes, although he also
did much to popularise Corriedales in the
Speck.
“The Deacon”: While the priests sang
Requiem over the soul of Mary Dowling, of
the Franciscan Friary, at Waverley
(N.S.W.) lately, memories stirred of the
husband that carried a pike in Smith
O’Brien’s rebellion in ’4B and the scholarly
old man’s fresh start in N. S. Wales; of
the old Windmill Hill estate where the local
representative of the Jubilee plunger, Colin
Smith, lives now, and of the irrigation
scheme for which “Ginger” Jersey, then
State Governor, turned the first wheel or
pressed the button, or whatever it was that
gave the disastrous venture its kick-off. Mary
Dowling was kinswoman of James Clarence
Mangan, and a wonderful solace to the aged
scholar on Windmill Hill. Two books from
her clever daughters are in the offing.
Like the Duke of Plaza Toro, Viscount
Novar (formerly Munro Ferguson, the G.-G.)
has floated himself into a company to carry
on his Scottish estates. It’s purely a familv
affair.
Herbert Smith, who represents Melbourne
in the Vic. Dreary House, has handed over
his first half-year’s screw (£100) to the
charities in his province. Of course, his
left hand might not have known what his
right hand had done, but most of Victoria
was acquainted with the happening betimes.
One Vic. country road will now certainly
be soled-and-heeled. Sam Barnes, Minister
for Railways and Mines, was still eight miles
from Korrumburra when the departmental
motor-car stuck in the mud. The Minister
stayed in the car all night swapping yarns
with Lynch, his sec.; and at daylight the
pair plodded to Korrumburra and caught the
train to town.
Adelaide has produced a miser of the real old
melodramatic type. Lie lived in utter poverty
in a suburb, in a cottage which has been
condemned as unfit since his death. He was
never known to spend any money, and his
neighbors believed that the scraps he begged
for his goats and hens were his own chief
food. He died lately, at 79, and some cousins
who divide his property find that he owned
several other houses, Bank of Adelaide
shares, and Treasury bonds—in all about
£32,000.
E. F. Pigot, the new and priestly head of
the N.S.W. branch of the British Astronomi-
cal Assoc., was educated at T.C., Dublin,
for a doctor, and studied the heavens under
Sir Robert Ball, of Dunsink Observatory.
He practised physic for some time in Dublin,
then entered the Jesuit order, and, coming
to Australia in 1882, was Science Master at
Riverview College for 17 years. After a
sojourn in China, first as missionary, then as
astronomer, ho returned to Australia in 1905
and started the Observatory at Riverview
with which he has been associated ever since.
AN AUSTRALIAN WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sunset fades on Italy,
The morning glow on Grecian heights is gone;
There is no glamor on the tideless sea
Where once the great stars shone.
The wonder of the tents of Shem
The narrowing desert may no longer hold;
The magic of the grey Jerusalem
Is wasted, thin and old.
The Moorish arabesques are dim;
The tall cathedrals of the past are chill;
The long lights die amid the poplars slim
And on the scented hill.
The dawning in a yellow land,
Old with soft silences and, new with dreams,
Mas all the happy roses in her hand
By these bird-haunted streams.
Italian lights are in your hair,
All Attic shapes are in your flowing dress;
No voice could touch the warm Castillian air
With such a smooth caress.
He who would be your chosen knight
Must walk in all high places with no fear,
Daring the utmost of the world’s delight
With laughter as a spear.
The love in your Australian eyes
Speaks with a warmer challenge than men knew
When Helen wasted beauty, and her sighs
To hate and red wounds grew.
For you with glory on your lips,
Mistress of all that is since time began,
Are woman to your eager finger-tips
To hold and save a man.

"The Rumpus”: The long chase of Roy
Governor recalls that on the Murchison (W.A.), in
the early days, a trooper with two trackers set out
on horseback after an abo. wanted for killing his
lubra. The wily Binghi led his pursuers a fair dis-
tance from their base into rough country, and then
commenced a game of “dodge about.” While the
John Hop camped for the night the murderer made
a wide detour, then followed the tracks of the law,
repeating this plan for a number of days, until it
became very difficult to pick out the new footprints.
After that particular portion of the country had
become hopelessly criss-crossed with tracks, the out-
law slipped away, and was immune from chase for
a few weeks until a mulga wire brought the chasers
an agnostic.
“I got nothin' ag'in ’ lckson, but my old man he hasn't no faith
in ’im at all."
on again, when a similar game was staged. lor
three months the trooper and his trackers were in
the saddle, until finally the capture of the abo. was
looked upon as hopeless. The aid of an old drover
was called in, and next morning the wanted mg.
was produced by a very miserable man—miserable
because the black had been his friend.

“Geo. Rich” : The Westralian police horse
Ural has been on the fodder-sheet of one station
(Mt Barker) for 16 years and done 65,000 miles in
patrol duty. The neddy’s forage bHI tots up to
over £4OO and the blacksmith has collected £7O
for fitting him with boots. Since joining the force
Ural hasn’t had a holiday nor has he been physicked
by a vet.
* * * *
“Tarago” : Bung’s wedding festivities were
at their height and the fifth bucket of beer, handed
out to a few of his most valued customers, was being,
rapidly drained. Brown, who had been placed in
charge, to insure a fair and impartial distribution,
was persistently interrupted in his duties by Smith,
who would butt into the inner circle every now and
again with the anxious inquiry: “’Ow much beer’s
left?” Even the threat to cut off his ration did not
abate Smith’s interest in the state of the bucket.
Finally Brown filled the last pint. “ ’Ere,” he said,
handing it to Smith with a flourish, take it, an
we’ll starve.” Smith gulped down the pint. “Is it
"finished?” he said. “Let’s shee th’ bucket.” This
was too much. “Yer cow-faced beer-’og,” roared
the M.C., shedding his coat, “do yer mean ter shay
I’m dis-hic-honest, an’ tryin’ ter beat yer fer a
beer? I’ll” “’Sail right, ’sail right,” said
Smith pacifically; “only I dropped me terbacker in
the beer an’ I didn’t wanter —hie —make a fuss
erbout it while yer wis servin’ it out.”
“Kenb'ir”: Has any Abo. ever seen the
lyre-bird as far north or farther north than Port
Douglas (N.Q.) ? On a recent specimen hunt in the
Mossman scrub I managed to photograph a pair, and
I would like to know if they are in any numbers in
Bananaland.

“Ynot”: That filly of “Ringer’s” (B.
7/6/’23) isn’t the only giddy young flapper. At Bar-
sham station, near Murrurundi (N.S.W.), a couple of
years ago, one 18 months old had a fine foal, but it
was killed to give her a chance to develop. She was
a draught filly, and a yearling of that breed is often
as far forward as a two-year-old of the lighter gallop-
ing or trotting breeds. Also, with a young filly the
gestation period is often only ten months or even
shorter. Incidentally, Granny can be as skittish as
the young ’uns. A brood mare, old Fanny Cook, had
twins when 22 years old, and the last of 15 foals
when 29. Isn’t that somewhere about a record?
“Bung” : Bill Sherd, who for the last 30
years has been doing the 50-miles mail-run between
Bungendore and Captain’s Flat (N.S.W.) six times a
week, once put up a better record than those
coachies recently cracked up in Abo. pars for their
capless wheel stunts. Bill did the most of his trip
with the whole wheel gone—the result of a collision
with a stump. The resourceful William improvised
a slide by strapping a long green sapling to the
brake-bar, and under the dismantled hub. He then
rattled his four-in-hand into the Flat, collected his
mails and a loading of passengers, and returned to
Bungendore with the much frayed pole still doing
service.
* * * *
“Valamac”: “Edge o’ Beyond’s” aquatic
kookaburra (B. 7/6/’23) is something new to me. I
don’t know of any bird, in this district, at any
rate, that gets drowned in such numbers as the
jackass. Each summer we fish dozens of the poor
silly coots out of open-top windmill tanks. Except
for an occasional crow, they seem to be the only
feathered creatures that try to drink from the tanks.
All the others have sense enough to take their
liquid refreshment from the troughs.
“Blunder Buss”: Tell “Primer” (B.
10/5/’23) that the advice I gave about testing a.
doubtful rifle for accuracy by fixing it in a vice (B.
15/3/’23) was obviously not meant for rifle-makers,
and experts, but for the inexperienced, and even
the latter would naturally place a piece of pine
board on each side cf
the rifle when putting
it in the vice; so the
fractional expansion
mentioned by “Primer”
wouldn’t amount to
anything. As for the
killing-power of the
.22 long, “Primer” re-
marks that, “with the
exception ‘ of buffalo
and alligator, the .22:
cal. is quite heavy
enough for any Austra- -
lian game, up to 106
yards.” Yet the majo-
rity of ’roos are shot
under 100 yards; so
how does he account for
’roo-shooters using any-
thing but a .22 ? He
admits that he him-
self uses a .32-40.
“Primer” hints that I
may be surprised to
learn that country
butchers slaughter their
cattle with a. -22 cal.
Good Lord, man, the
beasts so slaughtered
are standing in a very
small yard, and the
rifleman is within a few feet of their horns:
Even' then it takes a very clean shot to drop a
beast.
» * * *
“Graciosa” (Solomon Is.) : A while back
“Bouragi” said that there are only about six rolls
of Santa Cruz feather money in existence. Wrong.
It is still being made by the bush natives of Santa
Cruz, and can be bought for £1 to £2 a roll,
according to its condition. The birds from which
the feathers are obtained are about the size of the
red-heads we used to catch when we were kids. All
the feathers are used excepting the long ones from
the tail and wing. The birds are caught by means
of a forked stick to which a decoy bird, which has
been smoke-dried, is made fast. The fork is coated
with the sap of a bush tree (probably wild rubber),
tied in a favorable position, and the nigger sits in
the shade and does his own “calling.” The salt
water natives usually tie the catch by their legs and
smoke-dry them, but I have seen bush natives pluck
the birds alive and let them go free. At the weekly
market the dried birds are exchanged for breadfruit,
taro, etc. And no nigger would dream of going
courting unless he had a couple of rolls of feather-
money to back him up, as it’s a mark of social dis-
tinction —much the same as a pianner in the “ ’Loo.”
Incidentally, the loom on which the natives weave
their dilly-bags is an item of interest, and as far as
I can gather—“white man ’e bring ’im before, long
time too much”- —it’s probable it was introduced by
Mendana when he tried to found a colony late in the
16th century.

“Tom Pepper”: Here are a couple more
fluky shots. In the
early days of the
Barrier (N.S.W.) the
brothers W. R. and
S. R. Wilson, with
two other mining
magnates, were travel-
ling from the Day
Dream mine to Broken
Hill, when a turkey
was seen flying some
distance overhead.
There was a sporting
rifle aboard, and one of
the party said jokingly,
“Have a shot at that
turkey, Sam.’’
“Right!” said Samuel,
and took a casual snap-
shot at the bird. To
the astonishment of
everybody, including
the shooter, the turkey
fell. Again, one day I
was walking with a
friend on the shores of
Gol Gol Lake, river
Murray, and carrying a
Tranter sporting rifle
sighted up to 100yds.
only. Two swans were
swimming about
500yds. from the shore,
and my friend proposed
having a shot. I smil-
ingly handed him the
rifle and suggested sar-
castically that he
should aim at the head
of one of the birds. He
fired-—and a swan
promptly straightened
its neck on the water.
The wind was blowing
towards us, and pre-
sently my friend waded
in and brought the
bird to land. It was
shot through the small
part of the neck.
“Huffin-Guffin”: Re “D.F.’s” record-shout
entry (B. 7/6/’23). At Warracknabeal (Vic.) about
.30 years ago a worker was left a fortune of, I think,
£20,000. He at once married the girl, also a
worker, that he had been “saving up” for, and before
leaving on his honeymoon he handed a cheque for
£250 to the leading hotelkeeper to pay for drinks
for the whole town and district.

“Mag”: “E.W.” (B. 14/6/’23) has been
a long time discovering the virtues of the ibis.
For the overtime he works in tick and other pest-
infested regions, this bird has from the hazy past
been granted, year in and year out, a free ticket in
Bananaland. So persistent in business is this attenu-
ated stalker that in one year one ibis will, it is
estimated, eat 100,000 insects, an average of more
than 270 a day. A very fair cargo. “E.W.” should
advise N.S.W. North Coast cockydom to leg-rope
every ibis it can catch. P.S. —Failing ibises, Hy-
land curlews.

“Picko” : It always struck me as curious
that, the out-back bushies haven’t attempted the
equivalent of the time-honored
African larder stand-by, bil-
tong. In my wanderings I
have looked in vain for some-
thing of the sort, the . neces-
sary ingredients, meat and
sun, being available in unlim-
ited quantities. In most coun./
tries where the sun is hot and
dependable it is used to dry-
meat, and thus convert it into
a condition which defies most
climatic conditions for a fair
length of time. It’s no good
telling me “pickling” is good
enough for dad and mum, or
that blowflies preclude the
carrying out of the drying
process, as both of these things
exist in the countries which
have the sun-drving habit.
Sun-dried meat is very nutri-
tious and absolutely unsur-
passed as a sustainer for those who have the “hard
yakker” habit.

“McJ.”: Hickson isn’t the only faith-
healer, anyhow. To-day the boss had just sealed the
mailbag, when Jacky, who was suffering from a
“crook” knee, came along and asked for medicine.
The boss handed him the stick of sealing-wax.
“Here,” he said, “rub him hard fella. Good one
medicine.” Jacky did as directed, and w?s com-
pletely cured in half an hour.
“Alkaloid’s” heavy artillery:—
Re this matter of the head decorations of castrated
animals, here is the latest from Voronolf s laboratoi/
at the Parisian College of Experimental Surgery
Voronoff has definitely established that castrated
male goats and wethers are of smaller stature and
have smaller horns than the normal. Into those
animals in which the missing glands were xe-
engrafted, and the graft “took,’’ all the normal mare
characteristics returned —increased stature, increased
length of horn and general masculine tendencies.
Into a normal male goat a third testis was engrafted,
and the result was a hyperdevelopment of the sexual
characters, enormous overgrowth of horns and body
hair, a marked increase in size and the assumption
KINDLY MEANT.
“ Frettin ’ again! Cheer up, me lad. Why, you'll be out in less
’n seven years now!"
of an extremely aggressive attitude. From some
female goats and sheep the ovaries were removed, and
in their stead the male genital glands were placed,
and the females developed masculine characters. This
appears antagonistic to observations on similar pro-
cesses in cattle. But horns may or may not be a
dominant sex characteristic, and the results of cas-
tration are in part determined by this factor, and in
part by the general upset of internal glandular
secretions. Thus in cattle both sexes are equally
horned; in sheep the male has a much larger appen-
dage, whilst in the stag the male alone has antlers.
Moreover, in the stag these are small till the rutting
(breeding) season, when they develop enormously.
In the stag horns are a pure sex character, and
castration is followed by very rapid shrinking of the
antlers, the whole process occupying a fortnight. In
sheep the horn is dominantly masculine, and castration
might well be expected to approximate the condi-
tions observed in the stag. In cattle, on the other
hand, horns are not even preponderantly masculine,
and the effects of castration may be conditioned
partly by reversion to a potential female type, but
more probably by upset of endocrine gland function,
particularly the pituitary. This is in accord with
the general overgrowth of the bullock’s skeleton and
marked increase in weight as compared with the
smaller stature of castrated sheep and goats. These
views are in consonance with the theory advocated

permeates all animals, and that pure maleness or
pure femaleness is rare. Accepting this, and regard-
ing the sex glands as dominating sexual characters,
it follows that castration will allow (a) female
characters to exert their influence through inhibition
of male characteristics; and (b) the development of
characters due to upset of endocrine equilibrium
(the sexual glands being part and parcel of the
endocrine system).

THE SAD NIGHTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Blithe-hearted we ride to the north or west
As Fancy or Fact ordains;
Since we are uncertain which track is best,
We slacken our bridle reins;
We sing* as we ride thro’ the dawn-mists grey,
We laugh as the sun mounts high,
With Joy for companion the livelong day,
But Grief when the night is nigh.
We muster the mobs on the furthest out
Where only the reckless ride;
Our axes we ply ’mid the hoop-pines stout
Tn scrubs on the Brisbane side;
With always a joke for the spills and pain,
A jest for the knocks and scars ;
But grieve we anew when the night again
Brings memories and the stars. •
We sweat at our stands in the shearing sheds
With wearied backs, and a grin;
We fossick for gold in the dry creek beds,
We gouge the ranges for tin;
’Tis little we care at the golden noon
If ours be the corn or husk,
But sad are our hearts when the cool winds croon
Their song in the deep’ning dusk.
For whether we camp in the sheltered bend
Of a creek in the western land,
Or sleep in the park, at the long day’s end,
With those of the workless band,
As long as the pitying stars look down,
As long as we rovers roam,
We’ll lie on our backs ’neath the branches brown
And dream an old dream of home.
QUEENSLAND.

“171”: “FY7” (B. 17/5/’23) has an
imagination which can ignore facts when he says
that, using a .32 Winchester, he scalped a turkey
at 600 or 700 yards, “although the bullet landed for
beyond the mob.” The trajectory of a bullet from
such a rifle at that range would have been so high
that to have got his head in the way the turkey
must have had a neck nearly as long as “FY7’s.”
* * * *
“C.W.P.”: We were arguing heredity v.
training down at the post-office when Barker
chipped in. “Heredity,” he said, “is the most
powerful thing in nature. Only two years ago I
proved it conclusive with spuds.” Dogs was the
real subject of the argument, but we were willing
to switch off and let Barker give his potatoes a go.
“It was when I had the patch of ’taters on that
steep hill behind me hut,” he continued. “I drilled
the spuds in with a hoe, but found the sets wouldn’t
stay in their places—it bein’ so steep, they all
-wanted to roll down the drills to the bottom. So I
goes to town and gets several hundredweight of
nails, and I pegs every flamin’ set in his place with
a four-inch. The way them spuds vegetated was a
caution. They never stopped growin’ till their tops
was about eight feet high, and when they ripened 1
had to send a fire over the patch before I could
get at ’em to dig. That fire was so blamed hot
that when I did dig I found it had cooked every
flamin’ spud—baked ’em with their jackets on!
And what do I do ? Do 1 warm ’em up and start a
hot-potater machine in town? Not on your life.
When I come to look at ’em I found that every
blanky ’tater had growed with a four-inch nail
through him, just like his dad; and instead of
digging spuds I dug 20 ton of nails at 30 quid a
ton. That’s the strength of heredity for yer!”
* * * *
“Lomkey Ree” : While the Abo. fluid experts
are considering the erratic Lake George (B. 7/6/’23)
they might explain Poocha at the same time. Poocha
is a crater-like cup close to Oonnawigia station on the
Adelaide-Melbourne line. It is about 30ft. wide and
about 20ft. deep. All the summer stagnant water
lies in the bottom, with weird gas bubbles rising to
the surface. Alongside is Poocha Swamp, which in
a wet winter is filled by Tatiara Creek to a depth of
six or eight feet over an area of about 20 square
miles, Poocha filling to the brim at the same time.
The hole is quiet till winter is well advanced, then
without notice the water in it begins to swirl, and
inside 48 hours the whole of the swamp is sucked
into Poocha with a noise like a very large M.P.
taking much soup in a hurry. The local theory is
that an underground river carries the water from
Poocha and many similar “runaway holes” to the
sea in Lacepede Bay, but chokes at its outlet with
the first rush of winter water.
* * * *
“Biloela”: Cases where the mammarj
glands have come into action without the stimulus
of child-birth are not so uncommon as “The Over-
lander” (B. 31/5/’23) seems to think. Last year
in Mosman (N.S.W.) a single girl was minding a
hungry breast-fed baby whose mother had outstayed
the usual feeding-time. In an effort to quieten the
youngster the girl gave it her own breast. It imme-
diately quietened and sucked energetically. The girl
repeated the practice, w T hen to her astonishment milk
developed. A doctor to whom the matter was
referred put it down to nervous suggestion.
* * * *
“Ragar”: I’m with “Centurion” (B.
14/6/’23) concerning the absurdity of the teat-
sucking snake yarn. All the same I’d like to know
just how the crawlers do drink. If they can’t suck
and can’t lap and haven’t hands to hold the quart-
pot and pour its contents down their throats, how do
they get their liquid refreshment? I’ve watched
a tiger-snake lying at the edge of a water-hole with
its head half submerged, every now and then raising
it skywards with the action of a hen when drinking.
I thought at the time it was having a taste, but the
old bushie with whom I was camping declared other-
wise. Has any Abo. actually seen a snake drinking ?
* * » *
“Paul”: Wyong (N.S.W.) claims to have
grown the champion blackbutt sapling. It is on
Duffy’s property, goes 63ft. round the butt, has a
girth of 49ft. 10ft. from the ground and it’s a
climb of 90ft. to the first sprig.
* * * *
“Wingella”: Is it too late for this child-
ren-and-animal incident ? Once my blackfellow
brought home a big brindle cattle-dog, and said the
boss had bought him. I tied the animal up under
the shadiest tree I could find, fed and watered him.
Four hours later the boy dredged a note out of his
pocket. “Close up bin losum, missus,’’ said he
cheerfully. I read as follows: “Whatever happens
don’t let the kids go near this dog, and take cave of
yourself. He’s such a vicious brute that no one
can go near him, so I got him cheap.” At that
moment my youngest (15 months) was lying on the
ground with both hands in the ferocious canine’s
mouth, trying to grab his tongue, and the three
older ones (2J, 4 and 6 years) were brushing him
with bundles of grass. And I’ll swear that dog
was laughing as much as they were.
* * * *
“Jim Carew” : The native-bear supplies one
of the best examples of protective covering among
our Austraiian animals. Young Norman seldom
bothers to find a hollow to hide in—he simply
crouches in the big fork of a tree, and his grey,
patchy fur harmonises so well with the bark of the
box or gum he chooses that, except to the trained
eye, he is practically invisible. Strange to say,
birds frequenting the same tree take no notice of
him, but an opossum similarly hiding is attacked
and driven out.
w * *- *
“Peter”: I don’t know what age fish live
to, but I’m acquainted with a freshwater carp that
has a fair stretch to his credit. Fifteen years ago
I caught him on a pin, carried him home and
placed him in a well in my garden. The other
day I emptied the well and found the finny hermit
none the worse for his long period of solitary con-
finment. He is now back in the creek where I
hooked him.
* * • *
Some different differences
“Tarago”: “Jim Carew” asks (B. 14/6/’23) how
to distinguish at a glance the kangaroo-rat from the
paddy-melon. Granting all other features are alike,
he will find that Patrick’s feet are smaller and the
tail is shorter and thinner than in any of the ’roo
or wallaby family. Further, his body is more corpu-
lent and shorter than anything of his inches that
hops. This, I think, is how most bushmen tell him
at a glanfce.
“Pick”: The paddy-melon is rusty brown, and, his
haunt being always in low matted scrub, he has
adopted a crouching gait, with his forepaws not two
inches from the ground. The kangy-rat dresses in
light silvery grey, and resides on grassy open hill-
sides or rushy flats. He 1 carries himself the most
erect of any of the hopper tribes, and is thin and
lithe.
“Nor’-West”: The paddy-melon is really a small
wallaby, not unlike the scrub wallaby except that
it is a much darker grey, has a black stripe running
down the back, and the light face and body mark-
ings are slightly different. It inhabits grassy, river
and creek flats for choice. It has an entirely dif-
ferent gait from most other wallabies, getting along
by means of a quick-runmcng hop with the body
kept very low. It has a peculiar habit of holding
one fore-paw out sideways, as if that wing was
maimed. At the end of ills tail there is a hard
horny extremity or “spur.” The paddy-melon has
one trait in common with the kangaroo-rat, _ and
that is it always has a sa actuary log well within
range, and will make for it when hard pressed—
but that is the only resemb lance betw'een the two.
“D.M.’ : The kangaroo-not is invariably reddish-
g'rey, and looks something 1 ike a dwarf kangaroo.
On the other hand, a paddy -melon is always of a
darkish-grey color, with two black stripes running
along the back of the head to- the neck, one behind
each ear, and is like a small edition of a wallaby.
On being hard-pressed a kangaroo-rat will take re-
fuge in the first handy hollow log; but I have never
yet seen a paddy-melon do likewise.
“Old Timer”: The kanga.too-rat is thicker in
body and more hunched; its head and mouth and
teeth are the same as a rat’s; its fore-paws are
light-colored, and are shaped ,so that when placed
HE DIDN'T SEE IT.
“I suppose your consc fence smites you now
for hitting your wife with a broom?"
"It does, your Honor, it does. THE AXE WAS
THERE ALL THE TO ME.”
together, as they always are when the animal is sit-
ting up, they appear to be one paw. The claws
are also light-colored, and shaped for digging,
the same as a bandicoot’s. A paddy-melons paws
and nails are black, and the same shape as a walla-
by’s. It is a pretty little Cf eatui'e, while the kan-
garoo-rat is repulsive.
“Six-and-Eight”: The name paddy-melon, though
loosely applied to almost any Ismail wallaby, is pro-
perly only given to the very 114 ht and graceful little
Macropits thetidis. The heads of the so-called kan-
garoo-rat and the ordinary rat- are much alike, but
the paddy-melon’s has no resemt lance to the common
rat’s at all. The kangaroo-rat’s habit of making a
nest of grass in which it slei ps during the day
often settles the argument whetl er the animal seen
was a paddy-melon or not. If the beastie came out
of a grass nest the drinks are on the joker who said
it was a paddy-melon. Of kangi roo-rats, the genus
Bettongia is the most remarkable, bettongs being the
only ground mammals which posat prehensile tails.
THE HOUSE THAT JONES BUILT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On gentle days when Jane and George
Seem heirs to nature’s dower,
The wind comes down the Dead Horse Gorge
At ninety miles an hour.
Although the trees at Mason’s Flat
Are still in silent air,
The mountain grips its stony hat —
’Tis always blowing there.
What speed a real gale achieves
Through that grey gorge none know ;
There are no trees, there are no leaves,
No tuft of grass can show.
On not one jagged point of rock
The tufted clouds can twine;
The winds have rubbed each granite block
To make its roundness shine.
And when the western devils ride
A thin and wild blue sky,
Along the polished mountain side
The big quartz boulders fly ;
The eagle will not cross the place
Upon the calmest day
Without its tail before its face
To keep the stones away.
But Jones was really fond of air
And thought the prospect good ;
He built a humpy with great care
Of seasoned cypress wood.
He raised it up on piles of stone
And set it fair and true
Where all day long his eyes alone
Might see the splendid view.
He braced it through and through with steel
And screwed the wall-plates tight,
With bolted bands to make him feel
His house secure at night.
The frame was tied in such a way
The winds might blow or not;
The place through all the storms would stay
Unless they took the lot.
They did. When Jane was out with George
And airs were nice and still,
A puff of wind came down the gorge
And shook the western hill.
But 'ittle that could trouble Jones;
He felt his home was proof
Against all gales, although the stones
Were bumping on the roof.
Unless it lifted from the piles,
The hut was snug and tight.
The wind blew fifteen hundred miles
An hour or so that night.
Jones slept; he did not even heed
The rocking of the floor,
Nor worry o’er the tempest’s speed
Until it ceased to roar.
Then leaping to the window pane—-
A pane all braced with wire—
He asked the white stars to explain
Their dancing points of fire;
For they were jumping to and fro
And jazzing in the sky.
But suddenly he seemed to know
The perfect reason why.
THE INFLUENCE OF BOLSH.
“Say, Bill, now Willis is president l believe
we’re going to get a share in the mine."
“No good t’ me. By ownin’ nothin’ we’ve got
nothin’ to lose, but a devil of a lot to
kick at.”
The wind had tossed his humpy far,
But it had stood the strain;
, T t hurried towards the morning star
Swift as an aeroplane.
But everything within was snug,
So Jones went back to bed;
He might as well be in his rug,
At least, till he was dead.
He did not wake till half-past eight;
And then he stared around.
He knew that it was very late.
What was that swishing sound?
He rose in eager haste to look.
The floor was swaying wide;
His house rode near a sandy nook
Upon a rolling tide.
AT TEE PONIES.
“Are yer goin’ to settle up or aren't yer ?"
“ Don't I tell yer I’m broke; yer carn't git blood out of a stone.”
“No, but I’m going to show yer that I can knock chips orf it.”
Yes, he was drifting in to land.
He saw a palm-girt creek;
The walls he fashioned with his hand
Had not sustained one leak.
The floor was tight, the door withstood
The wetness of the sea ;
He felt that things were very good
Wherever he might he.
He had his breakfast then and shaved.
And just at ten o’clock
He knew his life and home were saved;
For, with the mildest shock,
He bumped upon that coral shore
Stuck fast in gentle sand.
And then he opened wide the door
And waded out to land.
It was the natives’ gala day.
Their arms to Heaven they raised;
In dances naked, wild and gay
Their god of winds they praised.
And when Jones strode amid the throng
Brought there o’er leagues of air,
It seemed that he had come along
In answer to their prayer.
The storm might blow or it might not;
’Twas all the same to Jones.
They stewed him in their largest pot
And devilled all his bones.
And still their windy god they love —
He hears two thousand miles —
And on occasion he may shove
A humpy from its piles.

Polo being a sport in which;* dash and
youth and horsemanship are of no avail
unless backed by real money. Kensington
on Saturday was the meeting-place for Aus-
tralia’s landed gentry and snoburbia. Hun-
dreds of motor-cars were parked around the
grounds, each with a load of barrackers,
though when Sydney really did beat Cooma
there was a kind of stupefied silence before
the hosannas of the motor-horns swelled to
the lowering clouds above. Sydney weather,
at any rate, is no respecter of wealth; it
turned a cold, grey eye on the day. and
country visitors who had left their frost-
bitten districts thinking to find warmth and
sunshine in Sydney were glad enough to
snuggle into fur-coats and heavy tailor-
mades.
The vice-regal Forsters were among those
who motored out before lunch ; but her Ex.
waited only to cast the glad eye at the' gather-
ing and then fled. Mrs. 'Pitt Rivers, brown-
coated and hatted, stayed on, supported by
Lady Patricia Blackwood in a serviceable
leather coat. If she had replaced her brown
velvet hat with a leather cap and been at
the steering-wheel of the G.-G.’s car she’d
have saved the party 55., for, according
to the placard at the gate, drivers in livery
were exempt from payment. (Australia has
evidently climbed to the viewpoint that a
livery makes an automaton.) The Rodney
Hangars brought a fur-coated party that
included Bea McDonald ; the Alexander Mac-
Gormick couple came, she in smart grey
tailorings; Mrs. Tony Hordern brought the
family to watch father; Mrs. Frank Osborne,
who brought daughter Katharine, flew a royal
blue hat above stone-grey tailorings. Brown
seemed the favorite wear among the younger
set—it was sported with equal success by
Betty Onslow, Mrs. Monte Stephen and fair-
haired Margaret Osborne. Eileen White,
from Bolivia, wore a cherry wool frock under
her furs; secretary Ken Austin’s wife was
henna-frocked and fur-coated; Una and
Eileen Bell were there; the Maple Browns
came from Goulburn, and pretty Beryl
Osborne, from Moss Yale, added a high
beaver collar to her powder-blue frock.
The Roy Agnew concert on Saturday netted
a crowded Town Hall. Flutters of prettily-
dressed young things, many of them stu-
dents of Roy’s, sold programmes for 6d. —
“autographed -by the composer one shilling:
really written, not rubber-stamped,” they
impressed on the buyer. A waiting-room so
filled with flowers that it smelled like a
hothouse even on that chilly night drew
every passing eye; hundreds of girls and
boys crowding out the cheaper seats; the
G.-G.’s very appreciative on their strip of
carpet; handsome evening-wraps purring
against the tweed coat or the Woy Woy Wolf
of the young business woman ; a contingent
of party-frocked Kambala girls, and a very
small sister of Roy’s in the front row, fair
bobbed head very sleek under a proudly-
erect blue bow —it was the sort of audience
that only Sydney could know, and for size
and variety was a monument to the organis-
ers, Mrs. Alexander Gordon and Gertrude
Barton. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, very graceful and
slim, frocked her turn in Lorelei shades of
bluey-green, but the sweet voice little more
than whispered her own two songs, “Trois
Femmes” and “Chanson d’Automme.” Gladys
Cole unleashed her fine soprano in both sec-
tions of the programme, and contralto Jes-
sica Omonds made a thrilling first-appear-
ance—-the beautiful voice reaching perhaps
its most golden in Lute Drummond’s transla-
tion of Puccini’s “Little Birdie.” There
were truckloads of flowers for everybody.
The Victoria League is a very correct
body. It was, perhaps, the last institution
to give up wearing long white kid gloves. So
when Sir Walter and Dame Margaret entered
thb vestibule of Stanway House the other
night on their way to the League’s meeting
at the Women’s Club and found a row of
high and seemingly extra-full garbage-tins
arfayed like a guard of honor along one side,
it was no fault of the League’s; and Sir
Walter and Dame Margaret, being perfect
gentlefolk, didn’t even look in their direction.
But a scandalised Leaguer, beholding them,
utfered a stifled moan: “Why didn’t we
think to cover them with a flag or some-
thing !”
The other morning Judge Backhouse
glowed more pink-and-white and Dickensisli
than usual, when, as president of the Crown-
street Women’s Hospital, his hand thrilled
to the touch of a crisp new cheque for
£lB7O, netted by the ball on the Ceramic.
The G.-G.’s lady handed it over, with the
remark that the Government subsidy would
make the Ceramic flutter worth £3752. That
ball was really one of the most successful
bits of closer settlement on record —about
3000 people managed to perch on the boat
itself or on the decorated wharf alongside.
People in street clothes and walking shoes
danced gaily alongside couples attired to the
last buttonhole in what the American shop-
girls know as “full formals.” There was
even a horrible whisper at one moment that
doors which had been locked had been, by
some magic, unlocked ; and an agitated com-
mittee rushed to make an inspection of the
vessel’s innards. One earnest lady even
thought the holds should be vacuumed for
philanderers; and, after all the excitement
below decks, Young Australia wasn’t there!
But it was a great night.
At the Wentworth the other night shoals
of the young Old Girls of the C. of E. Girls’
Grammar were escorted by male youth as
smooth-faced as the powdered darlings them-
selves. Mrs. F. G. Sargood, who is presi-
dent of the Old Girls’ Pnion, did the party
proud in handsome frocking of rose du
Barry velvet. Secretary Nessie Wynter was
velvet-clad; so was her sister Madge, whose
frock was carried out in Quaker-grey cheered
by a splash of crimson leaves. Principal of
the school Miss Wilkinson against soft swath-
ings of black satin clutched an armful of pink
carnations tied with the pale blue and white
of the school. Phyllis Cooley’s primrose taf-
feta warmed itself with a wide stretch of
fur in the between-decks region. Audrey
Hordern, in yellow satin and lace, and Mary
Rutherford, in gay floral taffetas. wer,e among
the many pretty frockers; and Yvonne Bul-
man, in rose-pink charmeuse, faced her job
as treasury-keeper with great outward cheer-
fulness.
Nearly 2000 of his flock —sheep and
lambs —foregathered at the Moore Park
Palais on the wettest night of last week for
a kind of unofficial levee in honor of Arch-
bishop Kelly. It would have taken nothing
short of a flood to keep the crowd away, for
the roll-up had been named “A Catholic
Ball” to distinguish it from a merely
Masonic Ball or a Highland Society’s haggis.
Dr. Kelly, enveloped in liis ruby-red robes,
looked both cosy and kindly as he mingled
with the crowd or turned a beaming eye
on the dancers from his own handsomely-
decorated pen against the wall. Half-Way
through the evening 22 white-clad debs,
were presented to him, and as they gravely
kissed his ring- maybe dimly realised that
this growing-up entailed something more
than jazzing through life. Dr. J. E. F.
Deakin was the successful president of the
ball, and his wife, handsome in grey brocade
and Dutch blue georgette, sponsored the
debs.
This is how May Moore’s camera saw
Dr. Lucy Gullett the other day. Inky Way-
farers in particular will be glad to meet
her, for she’s
a daughter of
Henry Gullett,
■one of the
best-remember-
ed and most
solidly brilli-
ant of Austra-
lia’s journal-
ists. Dr. Lucy
is helping to
build a suc-
cess on her
own account.
She is one of
the splendid
band that is
running the
Women’s and
Children’s
Hospital a t
Surry Hills.
This institu-
tion, founded
only a year
ago by the women doctors, has already dealt
with thousands of cases, and has, moreover,
paid its way without any calls on public or
Government. Dr. Lucy practises at North
Sydney; and her only diversion these days
is a big race meeting.
July 11 is the date chosen by the Catholic
Women’s Association for its dance at the
Wentworth; and on the same night the
Bankers’ Ball in aid of Prince Alfred’s will
be held as usual at the Town Hall.
The All-Matrons’ Ball, which is to rope
in the Consular sets, is a Wentworth fixture
for August 16. This is to benefit the Royal
Hospital for Women, and Dame Margaret
is giving it a vice-regal push. The art stu-
dents, among them clever Pliyl Maclachlan,
are doing window-cards, which will be auc-
tioned on the night.
Competition, especially among Society
matrons, as to who will cause the greatest
stir at the Artists’ Ball, has become so keen
that the fancy-costume shops may reap a
richer harvest than the Cause. Three, four
and five guineas are being paid for Period
costumes, which the original wearers own for
only one night—after that the costumes re-
vert to the makers. Tickets for the ball
are a guinea. Some patrons of the arts pro-
pose, so it’s said, to hand over four or five
guineas to the Cause, and wear either an
old frock or a home-made costume.
Lee White’s party at the Carlton for the
babies of St. Margaret’s drew what seemed
like millions of humans. All theatrical who’s
who dropped in to throw a shilling or two
into the hat, and Lee herself sold autoed
photos of her own flashing eyes and teeth
at £1 a piece. There were songs and turns
bv the “Back Again” Company ; and a stork
climbing a giant prickly-pear, or similar
vegetation, was a feature of the decorations.
Another, of course, was Clay Smith. When
the party broke up at 5.30 the 10,(X)0-shilling
goal had not been reached, but Lee W nite is
still optimistic.
Sooner or later Australia had to have its
Mary Bickfords, Elsie Fergusons and other
screen beauties —and here’s one of the early
birds. This bonny face belongs to Sybil
Shirley, one of
Sydney’s very
own film-stars,
who appears
in “The Din-
go,” the latest
Australian at-
tempt to gain
a footing in
the welter of
imported Yan-
kee stuff. She
was born at
Glebe recently
enough to be
still in her
teens, was edu-
cated at Ailan-
thus College,
Edgecliif, and
her grandad,
the late
George Smith,
of Manly, was
Ma yo r of
Sydney back in 1859; so tile Aussie stamp
is plainly upon her. The bright little lad'
put in some time in revue on the Tivoli
circuit after leaving school, then made three
minor appearances in pictures, and now lias
burst forth as a “star.”
The Home for Incurables is to benefit by a
ball this year. But this doesn’t mean that
the fete organised by chair-bound Maggie
Thwaites, of the Home, is to go to the wall.
The dance is an extra, and will be held in
the Town Hall on August 14.
There was no glittering Synagogue display
over the LaidjeyrLevy nuptials. The cere-
mony itself, with the splintering of the wine-
glass and the rest, was performed at Hill-
side, the Sep Levys’ Woollahra home. Helen
Laidley, the bride, is one of Sydney’s best-
looking society girls, though even her color-
ing hasn’t tile exquisite bloom for which her
mother’s was famous. For the sacrifice she
was clothed in a shimmering wonder of white
satin embroidered with seed pearls, the side
drapings caught with a big pearl ornament
that sprayed off into a fall of pearl fringe.
The Flemish lace train was lent by the Levy
side of the family ; and the lace veil was a
Laidley heirloom. The bride was unsupported,
hut bridegroom Pat had Clive Reid to s e o
him through. Helen’s mother, Mrs. Charlie
Young, in silver grey and delphinium-blue,
dealt out de luxe hospitality to over 300 of
Sydney’s best. Chosen and Gentile, at the
Wentworth ; and that’s a far cry from Wool-
lahra.
Helen Campbell, who has worked for 12
years at the American Consulate, and who,
quietly capable and blessed with the knack of
handling people and affairs, must have been
a Heaven-sent blessing to any brand-new
Consuls, suddenly decided to spend the rest
of her days in matrimony. The partner she
picked for the great adventure is George
Botting, an Australian. The American
colony sent the clever girl a well-fed cheque
as a small acknowledgment of value re-
ceived, and the staff handed over a dressing-
table equipment in vellum tones.
Mrs. Emily Carleton McQuade, widow of
A. F. H. (Fred) McQuade, of Tarana, Potts
Point, died in England a few days ago. She
was a daughter of Charles C. Skarratt, the
old landlord of the Royal Hotel, who made a
harrow-load of money out of Mount Morgan,
and put a lot of it into city property. The
McQuades had much the same tastes in pro-
perty. The three sons were all musical and
had the advantage of continental study. One
of them married Cissy Durant, who came
with Emily Soldene on her first visit to Aus-
tralia. Gerardy also married into the family.
Marriclcville’s Florence Nightingale died
last week. She was the wife of John Hawe,
a Sydney detective, now retired, and she
earned her title during the big ’fin epidemic
when she worked like six women, nursing-
invalids, minding children with sick parents,
and attending to afflicted households. Her
work brought her a testimonial from a crowd
of grateful people when the epidemic was
over.
Mrs. N. Hampson, wife of the English
artist, who first came to Sydney about five
years ago, returned with her husband and
little daughter Joyce by the Persic last week.
They’re glad to be back to the sun, which
they scarcely saw during their 18 months
away. The “domestic” problem, she says,
grows more and more difficult. Mansions
are at a discount —nobody wants them. All
along Hyde Park are rows of houses showing
the “For Sale” board. Everybody wants fiats,
and a building of “suites” is' bespoken even
before the foundation is laid. Often the only
help procurable is the charlady,. who comes
in by the hour to wield the broom and dust
pan, and as often as not puffs away at a
fag while she, does it.
Writing from London, a Sydney Arts and
Crafts woman, Mrs. E. M. Spring, has some
interesting things to say about exhibitions in
that overgrown hub. “At Olympia Ruth
Bannister had a small but attractive stall-
wood-carving in finely-sculptured designs.
The next big affair was the Royal Amateur
Art Society Exhibition, held in 45 Pont-
street, the beautiful home of Dame Alice
Godman. I was allowed to send only five
pieces. All were accepted and one gained
first prize, which made me an associate.
Princess Mary handed out the prizes and
certificates, and I had to bob twice. An
address book in repousse leather, with an
Australian design in gum-leaves, was bought
by Queen Mary. Princess Mary bought one
of Ruth Bannister’s umbrellas, a dark-blue
silk affair with a charming carved handle.
The Duchess of Somerset bought another,
with one of Ruth’s famous orange tops. We
were both so elated that we had to go out
and cool down.” Mrs. Spring, who has made
an almost sensational success of her Austra-
lian leather work, is to show at Glasgow in
August, and is booked for several big Crafts
Exhibitions in London later in the year.
Belgian Consul Segaert is planning an
August hold-up for the Belgian Benevolent
Society, and is praying that by then the
rigors of winter may be past: in Sydney’s,
unheated public halls it’s enough problem on
a cold night to remain unfrozen without the
additional agony of battering one’s brains
against the chilly front of a half-known lan-
guage. The play, which is named “Le
Grand Due,” is to arrive at the Conserva-
torium on August 4; and pretty Louise
Chautard will play a hand at unravelling
the comedy.
A Brisbane postscript:—
On his way back from the North Sir Matthew
arranged to catch the ’flu before returning to head-
quarters in Brisbane, where 5000 cases were reported
on June 28. However, his intrepid Ex. went to the
annual meeting of the Mater Hospital. He said he
felt able to express his opinion of hospitals, seeing
that he had left one only the previous morning. Dr.
P. Page read the annual report; Premier Theodore
spoke his piece; Lieut.-Gov. Bill Lennon thanked the
hon. medical staff; and A. .T. Thynne thanked the
Governor.
At Rockhampton Sir Matt talked to the women on
the subject of the Country Women’s Assoc., and re-
marked that the Geographical Society would like to
collect facts about Queensland history, white and
aboriginal. His Ex. flew round Charters Towers
and laid the foundation of the new hospital ward;
talked cattle with Ernest White at Bluff Downs, and
came back to a chorus of sneezes in Brisbane on the
27th, after nearly a month’s absence.
Walter Hunt and Eve Warhurst took the Elite for
the first repertory venture Brisbane has ever known,
and “The Gay Lord Quex” filled the bill. Among
the players are Dr. W. N. Robertson’s tall daughter,
Maida Marlay, Vivienne Humber (in charming frocks),
Merv.vn Jones, Ralston and other Smart-setters.
“Prunella” is to be the next adventure.
St. Andrew’s Scotchbyterian Church was filled
with white flowers, asparagus-fern and guests for the
wedding of Flora Mofflatt and Hogarth Billington.
The bride was in ivory satin marocain, with pear!
’broideries and silver tissue, and a Brussels net veil.
George Moffatt gave her away. Early Victorian
frocks in blue, mauve and apricot brocade were
respectively worn by bridesmaids Billington, Young
and Lorna Moffatt, and the hats were of shot silver
tissue. Little train-bearer Marie Moffatt was in a
Dutch frock of lime and a cap with narrow ribbon
trillings. Dave Butler and Alan and Ross Macdonald
stood by the ’groom; Herrington, D.D., tied the
knot; and at Toorak a large party ate the wedding-
breakfast. The bride went away in nigger brown
to her husband’s home at Warra.
The Old Grammarians took the South Brisbane
City Hall for their annual shivoo. Their two-blues
were the principal decorative hues, but the supper-
room blazed with poinsettias. Headmaster Boii-
field’s spouse wore gold lace and tulle with a blue
sash effect; and all the smart and intellectual folk
turned up.
Mollie Skipper had a number of farewell parties be-
fore she was married to Selwyn Smith by Canon de Witt
Batty at St. John’s Cathedral the other day. The
bride wore ivory taffetas with silver roses and an
embroidered tulle veil. Lorna Gibson, in salmon
pink, was bridesmaid, and. Alan Carrie saw the
bridegroom through. After the wedding-luncheon,
at Virginia House, the pair fled to North Queensland.
St. John’s College perpetrated a ball in the South
Brisbane Hall, where, amid the chocolate-and-gqld
of the school colors, about 200 jazzed blissfully.
The Rev. Stevenson and his wife (in turquoise)
received the guests.
At long last North Queensland is to have a mental
hospital. It will be on the Atherton Tableland, that
wonderful district in the tropics where they use
blankets all the year round. Up till now South
Bananaland has had all the State’s mental homes,
which meant that some patients from the North have
had to endure shocking hardships before they had
a chance of getting proper treatment. The new
hospital will be in one of the healthiest climates in
the world.

wheeziness are ended, and there is a
speedy sense of ease and relief. You
can carry Peps in your pocket, for they retain
their potent medicinal power for many days.

They say that Melba had a proposal dur-
.ng her last Maoriland musical expedition.
The smitten gent, was a man whom Nellie
had never seen, but who had been to one
of her concerts and satisfied himself that
"she was a mighty fine woman for her years.”
He proposed by telegram, reply paid, which
for a Scotchman was most improvident. The
telegram ran to about 60 words, and inti-
mated that the suitor was a farmer with
£5OOO of his own. There was a winning
protestation of affection, and then this most
gracious conclusion: “I have a good light
baritone voice, and if you don’t care for
farming I could sing seconds at your con-
certs.” "At any rate, I admire his modesty
in not expecting me to sing second,” said
Melba.
Natalie Dawson and Mrs. Poolman las-
soed the crowd in their hundreds fbr the
benefit musical tea to tenor Coscia and his
violin-playing signora at the Oriental. Miss
Mcßae had lent the floor, and contributed
the 4 o’clock food. A squad of bridge- and
poker-enthusiasts spiced the musical fare
with a little flutter in an ante-chamber.
Coscia, who starred at the Milan Opera
House before he and his Sara set out to
prospect musical Melbourne, says he landed
here with £6OO in his wallet, and that it
dwindled to ss. A benefit concert in the
Athemeum Hall yielded enough to pay their
way back to Itaiy and a bit over, and this
last affair will mean something more. Music
in various mediums was made by the two
stars, Natalie Dawson, little Gordon Mcßae,
Dolly Stewart, Francesca Duret (who is
packing her music-case for Italy), George
Cowley, Jack Browne and Eileen Pascoe
Webb. Sylvia Shaw was called on to auction
sweets; then tables were swept aside for some
ballroom dancing by Charity Wynne and
Seeley Sampson. Ruby Norton, Clarence
Senna, the Pounds sisters, Patti Russell and
Walter Kirby smiled professional approval
on the latter" end of the programme.
Ethel Campbell, the girl who used to give
Diggers a welcome and flap them a last fare-
well with her flags at Durban, has come to
Australia, and the Returned Soldiers’ League
is arranging welcomes for her in various
centres. What is best remembered about
her are the verses she wrote in a moment
of anger when a Durban councillor had re-
ferred to “drunken Australians.” Her lines
remarking that she would rather be a
drunken Australian “than a wealthy Durban
funk” warmed the hearts of the. Diggers ; and
most of those who keep relics of the war have
a copy of that generous outburst. Miss Camp-
bell has a pretty large circle of kinsfolk
in Australia, including the Alfred Cowleys,
of Brisbane —and few people whose years
kept them at home did more for the Diggers
than that couple.
Lorna and Toots Pounds came back for
six months fresh and unspoiled as when they
left 12 years ago. While saying their good-
byes in London the sisters laid. a wreath, on
the Cenotaph which immortalises Britain’s
dead. Numbered with these is their brother
Harold, who at 20 found an Anzae’s grave
in France. Neither of the Pounds boys
developed stage aspirations. Harold was
making good with the Kodak Co. here when
the drums sounded, and his young brother
Billy has already started out on the business
end of the movies.
The Pounds girls, by the way, add their
little suggestion of boiling oil or melted lead
for miscreants who export Australian genius
to the Smoke without a backing of bank-
notes or influence. The sisters frankly con-
fess that they would never have got througti
had they not had their parental roof-tree to
shelter them. Even when they did manage
to arrive it took many a long day to estab-
lish their claim to stay arrived. They tell
that, after winning an armful of musical
laurels, the Chisholm sisters, from Lismore,
were turned loose from a London College to
find a job as best they might. Toots and
Lorna found, them scraping out an existence
with piano and fiddle in a cafe. With
Toots’s help their duetting was staged as
a “turn” which found favor in the halls:
They are now earning £5O a week and fame
enough to lead them later to the concert
ooards.
A courageous soul was John Cronin, Direc-
tor of the Botanic Gardens, who relinquished
his hold on life on Saturday morning. For
more than a year he was doomed, as he suf-
fered from an incurable ailment. After be-
ing put out of action for a few months he
resumed duty, but had to desist again.
Cronin was treated none too tenderly by the
State Government, but, fortunately for Min-
ister Oman’s reputation, three months leave
of absence on full pay had been arranged
for him just a day or two before his death.
The Alliance Franqaise took the Indepen-
dent Hall for its first winter “swarry” and
giddily decked its dingy interior with a lorry-
load of green stuff and bunting punctnated
with potted orange-trees burdened with fruit.
It was a French party, and no one dared
talk English above a whisper. The star
performer was Mr. Karagheusian, r rench
lecturer at the ’Varsity, who discoursed on
sport in France with such humor and clarity
that even those who don’t parley-voo to any
great extent could laugh in the right places.
Mrs. Weber, M. 11. Laroche and-M. Oliver
put on a sparkling little playlet with almost
professional skill, and Sylvia Van Ascbe,
Viola Morris and Wilfred Taylor sprinkled
music through the programme. Mrs. Jimmy
Dyer, as president, hostessed in grey satin
and a summery smile. Consul Turck’s wife
wore a colored swathe round her head and
a black satin frock. French Professor Chis-
holm dropped in to add lustre to the gather-
ing, which wound up with the usual cake
and coffee.
Pat O’Hara Wood, who lately launched a
sports shop, is now embarking on a matrimonial
venture with a Victorian tennis championess,
the Roy Lister widow. As a flapper the lady
helped'to make local tennis history by beat-
ing Lady Henman in single combat on the
championship courts. She has a small son,
John.
Belief that Clara Butt is own sister to
Carrie Tubb, another fashionable vocalist, is
a common delusion in England, it seems.
The idea is that both names are assumed,
and were chosen on account of the family
name being Hogshead, or Pigspail, or Barrel
perhaps. London papers frequently reply
to correspondents who have been betting that
Clara and Carrie are sisters, and invariably
add the information that Ethel Hook is a
Butt sister, and that Lawson Butt, the
actor, is a brother of the divinely tall pair.
The Fred Thiel matron, off with her
band to survey the tropical attractions of
Java, farewelled her intimates the other day
with lunch and bridge at Menzies’. She
did it in black marocain with steel chains
imprisoning the skirt, _ and a black cloak
topped with a ribbon-trimmed toquelet. Mrs.
De Bavay was there with daughter Marie ;
so were Dr. Downey’s wife (a sister of
George Smith, Her Majesty’s cheery man-
ager), Mrs. Leslie Macdonald, Mrs. Agar
Wynne, Mrs. Gilbert Lodge, Mrs. Herbert
Hewlett, and so on.
This Rembrandt photo of Jack Bellew, a
young Inky Wayfarer who has ambitions as
a short-story writer, will help to mark the
flight of time
for veteran
pi ay goers.
Girls used to
rush in their
thousands t o
gaze upon
young John’s
grand-dad—the
famous beauty-
actor, Ivyrle
Bellew. Even
during his last
season here
with M r s.
Brown Potter
mature women
rivalled the
gallery girls
with their col-
lections of the
m u m m e r’s
photos, which
were vended
in the theatre
between the acts at a shilling a-piece. Neither
son Pierre nor grandson Jack inherited the
histrionic microbe from Kyrle, who got it
from his father, the Rev. J. M. Bellew.
Pierre is well known on both the business
and literary sides of local journalism, and
Jack did a year’s medical course at the
’Varsity before he decided that in his hand
the pen was like to be mightier than the
scalpel.
Sybil Thorndike, declared by May Max-
well (not long back from Europe) to be the
most powerful actress in England, made s >me
pertinent comments on clothes and their
wearers the other day. Most women, she
thinks, “take a certain interest in clothes”
(oh, they do, they certainly do!), but only
a few have the real “dress instinct.” Pro-
bably the indictment holds truer of English-
women in general than of Aussie girls, who
get wider scope for individual expression in
glad rags. Still, there are lots of Melbourne
girls, with money to burn on their adorn-
ment, who have no dress thoughts except
what they borrow from fashion-plates, and
very little idea of which fashion-plate they
ought to want to look like. What a sight
are the over-dressed specimens! They fully
bear out the dictum of Sybil Thorndike:
“Often, too, the less dress instinct they show
the greater will be their interest in clothes.”
Money doesn’t give them the instinct. The
Connie Waughs of this world are born;
accident determines whether they shall get
a show to wear garments worthy of their
artistry.
A grand-nephew of Sir John Franklin,
one-time Governor of Van Diemen’s -Land arid
later Arctic explorer, who has been editing
Lady Franklin’s diary and correspondence,
came across the address presented to her by
the residents of Melbourne in 1839. Among
the signatures is that of Johnny Fawkner;
and the lady’s reply is dated from “Fawkner’s
Hotel, April 6, 1839.” That pub was on
the N.-E. corner of Collins and Market
streets. The interesting document has been
given the Agent-General for transmission to
our Gaud Mayor.
Newbury is the exhibitor of the moment
at the Athenaeum Gallery. Every other week,
or oftener, there is a new display of paint-
ings these gloomy days, and truly a picture-
gallery is a gladsome place when the land-
scapes show sunlight. One looks at them
and 1 asks: “If Winter comes, Can Spring be
far behind?”
Alex. Colquhoun, the veteran painter who
has lately been congratulated upon his “Year
Book of Victorian Art,” is herewith pictured
by Marietta. He came to Australia from
Scotland at 14
and is one of |
the two 01
three survivors
—another is
John Longstaff
—of those who
learnt their
art under Fol-
ingsby at the’
Melbourne
National Gal-
lery. Though
the fact has
long been for-
gotten, Golqu-
houn was sec-
ond in the first
scramble for
th e Gallery’s
Travelling
Sc ho larship.
Besides exhib-
iting at the
Vic. Artists’
and Australian Art Assoc, s shows tor many
years, he was secretary to the Artists for a
considerable term; and, in addition to writ-
ing much for the popular McCubbm books
on various painters, the energetic boot has
since 1914 toured the galleries for Melbourne
Herald. ~
A recent snapshot from Paris shows David
Low’s sister Dorothy standing beside her hus-
band, Senor Vargas. The little lady was ill
for many months, but now she is better, ana
there is a small, dimpled infant claiming her
attention. Her man comes from Bogota, the
secluded capital of the South American Re-
public of Colombia, which is reached, after
a long trip up the Magdalena River, by pro-
bablv the most picturesque’funicular railway
in the world. The Best People in the place
are pure Spanish. Though they are only a
few miles from the Equator, the altitude or
their nest makes pneumonia pretty deadly

Incidentally, the only tree that flourishes in

Austin Batman Weire, who laid down
life’s load at Sandringham at the week-end,
was a son of the youngest daughter of John
Batman, founder of Melbourne. For many
years he whs in the State service, and was
given charge of old-age pensions on their
inception in 1901. When the Common-
wealth took over the burden 14 years ago
Weire was made Deputy-Commissioner, for
Vic., and held the job for six years. For the
last eight years he had been resting on his
laurels. Fifteen years ago he talked of writ-
ing a volume on the humor of old-age pen-
sioners and applicants for pensions, but if he
assembled the material he never published it.
The Harry Chauvels are thrilled over the arri-
val of the baby girl which Dr. Stork left on
the South Yar'ra doorstep -last week. Daugh-
ter Helene, who hitherto reigned as the
youngest of the family, is now rising nine.
Looking at the girlishly-beautiful Chauvel
dame, no one would suspect her of being
the mother of the 17- and 15-year-old boys
who sport the pale blue of Geelong Grammar.
The Maudsley, Masson and Mitchell
dames, assisted by Mrs. Alex. Leeper, host-
essed the adjourned supper-party for Prof.
Mackail and his wife after Friday night’s
poetry lecture. All the literary elite turned
up at the Alexandra Club for it, and every-
one struck his (or her) finest highbrow, atti-
tude to fit the occasion. Mrs. Mackail, in
blue brocade, was caught in a whirl of in-
troductions. Her daughter, Mrs. Thirkell,
flew hectic red panels at the sides of her
black velvet dress. The Maudsley dame
trailed well-cut black georgette; Mrs. Mit-
chell was in very beautiful blue velvet, and
their sister-hostess wore inky coverings.
Next Monday’s matinee at Her Majesty’s
will be one of the smartest the big J.C.W.
theatre has known —certainly the smartest
it will know between now and its approach-
ing reconstruction. Mrs. Priminister Bruce
is hon. organiser, and the good cause is the
Renown Free Kindergarten Building Fund.
The vaudeville theatres are contributing
“turns” to happen between acts from “Sybil”
and the Princess’s; and stars like Moisei-
witsch and Harry Lauder will help make
great business for Mrs. Ferrers Guy, who is
hon. ticket sec., and whose ’phone number
is 5934 Windsor.
We are always hearing about the crowds
which rush the once-empty St. Mark’s at Fitz-
roy now that a. movie show and a jazz hall
have been added ; but so far no one has un-
loosed any public note of exclamation con-
cerning the infinitely vaster congregations
which overflow St. Paul’s Cathedral every
Sunday night since Archbish. Lees unpacked
his gaiters. In these throngs one sights
about 20 male worshippers to one woman—
which serves to prove that men are still
ready to answer to the call of a preacher
who knows what to say and how to say it.
A recent reference to Alfred Deakin’s
voluntary refund of £4OO out of the £4OOO
allowed him by the Government for expenses
on a trip to England recalls an annual
action of the conscientious George Higin-
botham. As Chief Justice he was entitled to
£5OO a year more than the puisne Judges,
but he held that “the Chief Justice is only
primus inter pares, necessary as a chairman
and representative of the Bench, and to make
official arrangements, but with no other
authority superior to that of his fellow-
judges.” He. therefore, regularly set aside
the extra £5OO, and blewed the lot each year
on a series of four dinners. To one he in-
vited all the Judges, County Court as well
as Supreme Court; to another all the chief
officers of the various courts; to a third
all the barristers; and to the fourth a num-
ber of prominent solicitors. Before his ele-
vation to the Bench, if a solicitor marked
one of his briefs at so many guineas, and
Higinbotham thought the work not worth
it, he would scratch out the amount and
write a smaller fee in its place. This amaz-
ing person also carried his conscientious
scruples so far as to refuse to use his rail-
way pass except when travelling on strictly
judicial business.
Adelaide drops a line or two: —
John Bishop’s farewell concert took an enthusiastic
crowd to the Town Hall, among them Lady Bridges
and her small daughter, Miss Judge, Dr. Gerald Hay-
ward, Mrs. Teesdale Smith and her deb. daughter,
Mrs. Cecil Corbin and her sister (the latter up from
Mount Gambier), the Kenneth Bakewells, Mrs.
'Warren, Miss Schomburgk and Mrs. Quesnel. Grieg’s
“A Minor Concerto” was the item of the evening,
with William Silver (the boy’s teacher) at the second
piano. Maude Puddy, Katie Joyce, Hilda Gill, Alice
Meegan, Gerald Walenn, Harold Parsons, Fred Stone,
Richard Watson, Brewster Jones, George Pearce and
Harold Wylde all helped the programme along.
The Victoria League staged the second of its winter
lectures on the same evening, with Chief Justice
Murray in the chair and Prof. Geoffrey Dufßeld as
lecturer. Dufßeld served his ’prenticeship to science
at the ’Varsity here, and has been prime mover in
persuading the Federal Government to establish a solar
observatory at Canberra, so his subject was fittingly
“The Sun.”
The committee of the Girl Guide fete was tea-ed
by Lady Bridges at Government House the other after-
noon, and they exchanged mutual congratulations on
the £415 their joint labors had added to Guide funds.
Guides are, booming in S. Aus. since Miss Prior’s
visit.
Feminine rowers went gay at the Grosvenor when
the Barcarole Club gave a dance in honor of the
winners of the Ladies’ Championship at Perth. Decora-
tions were chocolate and blue, with Iceland poppies
on the supper tables and the silver cup that the crew
won as champions of the Murray.
Doctors cluster as thickly ih this village as leaves
in Vallombrosa, and a hundred of them turned up to
the B.M.A. dinner at the Grand Central. Six of the
hundred were women, and one of the six—Violet
Plummer—replied to the toast of “The Ladies.”
A dance to give a further lift to the funds for
the Soldiers’; Memorial Hall 'at Barmeera was held at
the Palais with Col. Butler, H. E. Fuller and the
Slane and Hill dames as its chief organisers. A bitter
night and the ’flu cut the attendance to something
lower than last year’s figure, but tickets were sold
in plenty, and that’s the main thing. The inevitable
balloons and caps were side-lines. Which recalls
that dancing teachers here, interviewed by the press
on such fripperies, have almost unanimously declared
against them.
Adam Lindsay Gordon’s old home, Dingley Dell,
in the Mount Gambier district, is receiving a lot of
attention from a local committee. It attracts a
steady pilgrimage now: 2000 people signed the visi-
tors’ book within the last year, many of them from
overseas.
The Ministerial-ciim-vice-regal party which is visit-
ing the heart of Australia, happened on a time of un-
usual moisture. High feed is everywhere, and the
motor-cars iof the party were often in mud up to
the axle. Even a monster corroboree by the Arunta
tribe was a literal washout.
Adelaide press-girls will get no more hints from
James Collins, who for 30 years was keeper of the
office at Government House, which is the link between
that establishment and the outside world. He had
held the job under eight Governors—-Kintore, Bux-
ton, Tennyson, Le Hunte, Bosanquet, Galway, Weigall
and Bridges—and was close on 70 when he died.

HUDSON SUPER-SIX,
HUDSON strength begins with engine
and chassis design, it is developed
in the construction, and is the pre-
dominant feature throughout the whole car.
Nothing is left to chance; every piece
of material that goes into the construc-
tion of the car is tested and retested until
the whole car represents the best obtain-
able in manufacture and material.
. It is from this that the Super-Six gets
its ability to outlast and outperform cars
of much higher price, and it is this that
has made it —

SURE CATCH TACKLE
feouth Australia flapped its wings at
Moonee V alley last Saturday after the jumping races
had tailed to a pair of National candidates from the
State where mighty Fiscom was trained. In the
hurdles Brownland (5 to 2) jumped better than the
favorite, Flaviol, and staved off a fine, lorg run that
Jaekstaft made from the home turn. The Sea Prince
gelding failed by a head to give Brownland 241 b.,
?mu ln j 6 a^i° n al he meets her at a difference of
101 b., and if the extra mile doesn’t serve him better
than it suits the daughter of St. Anton the racing
world will be surprised.
Brownland’s victory improves the prospects of
Argosy Boy, if rumor can be trusted. S’Australian
calculations have always favored the Boy’s chance
m comparison with Brownland’s, so he must be in-
cluded with Jackstaff, Berrinbo, Mnemar and Hamish
among the most dangerous quintette. There are
others, it is true. Bounding Wave, Gulyarri, Loja
and Bendoc are possibilities, whilst Sandule and Pis-
to'i.er, representatives of a more brilliant hurdle-
racing past, are fancied in some places. But to thi=!
paper s way of thinking the placed horses this yeat
wui be comparative newcomers at the game. Two
or three of the favorites may be checked or quite
upset by poor jumping, yet the race will probably be
fought out by five- and six-year-olds. Say, Berrinbo,
Jackstaff, Mnemar and Hamish in that order. Likely
as not the weather will have first say in the result
b} making the _ ground exceptionally heavy.
Haoma won the steeplechase at Moonee Valley so
brilliantly that only the old doubt about his fondness
tor a gruelling-struggle can fairly excuse punters
who will back Liberate to beat him in the National
-Neverthdess Liberate, With only a trifling advantage
ot 41b. as compared with their Va’lev weights will be
??P.® c , te ® to wear Haoma down at Flemingtbn.’ Bright
Maid s performance in the same race was unsatisfac-
tory, seeing that she had shown good pace on the
Ki.ic the week - 14 may be pleaded on her
Denail that she had an amateur rider up. Wooloo
had his amateur-riding owner up, and to the dismay
ol his backers for the National this rarely ineorrec*
old jumper was one of the two that came to grief.
Berrinbo, carrying 151 b. more than his National
Hurdle impost, made pork and beans of the field for
the Jumpers Flat. Among a crowd of other hurdlers
hunt (’chasers Mountain God and Agar were
out of place in such company) Hamish showed more
National promise at the weights than Bendoc and
Argosy Boy, who finished ahead of him, or
Loja, who led him for a time. But Berrinbo’s
chance for next Saturday shone brilliantly after his
easy win on the flat. It looked all the brighter in
light of the fact that Royal Guardian came limping
home. Another dangerous National opponent had
gone.
# * * *
“0.K.” : The feeling about the Nationals
this season is that ca’culations are likely to be
npset to a greater extent than usual by' slovenly
jumps. Even in the Hurdle Race several falls may
be expected. There are no such trusty jumpers as
liscom, Bright Plume and Telecles in the field for
next Saturday’s event. There may be first-class per-
formers of the future among the younger horses —■
the new-comers at the game—but none of these, bar
Perhaps Jackstaff, have had experience enough
to justify punters in taking their clean clearing of
the hurdles as a matter of course. The handicap
shows this in the fact that few were weighted above
AOst., whilst old Sandule was left topweight with
list. 51b., and Pistolier at 12 years of age was
given 61b. more than the lOst. 41b. he carried into
third place five years ago. This venerable stager
oas to concede eight years and 241 b. to a respectable
Povice in Brownland.
* * * *
“0.K.”; About the kind treatment of Shil-
linglee for the Melbourne Cup there can be no
question. The imported horse brought respectable
English form to Australia, the form uearing disauct
evidence of stamina. His breeding promises staying
power. He was slow to get acclimatised, and his
running was very poor even as recently as March,
in the Australian Cup; but apparently Shillinglee
was improving slowly all the time. In the Sydney
Cup, with 7st. 21b. up, he was rushed to the front
(apparently on behalf of King Ingoda) and there he
stayed until the last furlong, when David and Heir
Apparent beat him by a leng.h and a half, and half
a length respectively. The Cypher was loming fast,
but didn’t quite catch him. The pacemaker's perform-
ance was a good one and it was his last performance
for the season. Bred to English time Shillinglee, a young
5-year-old, was green compared with Amazonia when
that plodding animal finished a poor third to Eurylh-
mic at Randwick in 1921. But in the Melbourne Cup of
the same year Amazonia carried 31b. more, 7st.
111 b. in all, and was placed third again. If there
is. nothing against his character the English horse
may be the second imported one to do the Melbourne
Cup trick.
* * * *
“Wodgil”: The Nardo tote-odds coup (B.
28/6/’23) was clever, but a cleverer was brought off
in Westralia years ago by the connections of a
hoppled pacer known hereinafter (but not then) as
Stingaree. It was in the days when Alick Clydesdale,
now M.L.A. for Canning, ran pony-races-etm-trots at
Bicton-on-the-Swan, and when dead-game sports made
the pilgrimage from Perth in a river steamer which
same gay student of nomenc ature had dubbed “The
Gunboat.” There was a ss. place-machine at Bicton,
and on horses backed for a place the s.-p. book-
makers always paid tote-odds—not one-fourth of the
ring price, as is the custom elsewhere. Also, they had
no 10-to-l limit, or anything of the sort. That came
afterwards. Stingaree was without performances, but
having satisfied themselves that he was good enough
to get a place among the cabhorses racing at Bicton,
his owners backed him at tote odds for an impending
trot. One man launched the commission, which
amounted to £7 10s., and was distributed among
the Perth and Fremantle shop-bookmakers in ten-
bob bets; another was stationed at the machine to
buy one ticket on the trusty steed. He got his
printed slip half-a-minute before the race, and its
number was 1, but just on the tick of time, 2 and
3 were purchased by an old lady who had been watch-
mg his proceedings, as old ladies who haunt the tote
will. At a critical stage of the race, when running
neck and neck with Paddymelon for third place,
Stingaree broke. There is a pleasing tradition that
the cry of a strong man in his agony offering the
rider of Paddymelon a tenner to take hold startled
all the cattle in the neighborhood. Anyhow, Paddy-
melon went “up,” and the other intelligent beast
ambled in third, and paid over £27 for ss. His party
got their £7 10s. back with £BOO-odd added. But
for the inquisitive old lady they would have col-
lected about £2500.

Maltster (Bill of Portland—Barley), who
died last week, was a great three-year-old and a
wonderfully successful sire. In 1900 he won the
A.J.C. and V.R.C. Derbies, and ran second to his
stable-companion Clean Sweep in the Melbourne Cup,
conceding him 111 b. Unlike the Sweep he wasn’t
specially prepared for the Cup, otherwise the result
might have been different, as he was a much better
horse. At the stud Maltster sired nearly 700 winners
whose successes included pretty well every race of
importance in Australia except the Melbourne Cup.
And in that handicap his best son, Alawa, ran second
in 1909 with 9st. 31b. on his back—and a four-year-
old at that—to a really great three-year-old in Prince
Foote.
THE HORTICULTURIST.
BOOKMAKER: “I’ll lay the fee-yuld!"
INNOCENT AMATEUR: “I suppose he's a gar-
dener out of a job. But there can't be
much for him to do here, can there?
The grounds are so beautifully laid out
already."
Joseph Andrews’: Racing in the Speck
has been hard hit by the increased totalisator tax.
Since the extra 2| p.e. was imposed not one meeting
has shown a profit, and as punters are finding it
cheaper to stay away than to have 3s. in the £
deducted from anything they may be lucky enough
to win, the clubs’ only alternative is to reduce
stakes. These are already too small to attract
anything of class from the mainland, but so long
as the Government .collects its 5 p.e. on everything
which passes through the machines the quality of the
cattle engaged doesn’t worry it in the least.

The singles at Wimbledon were robbed of
interest about half-way through by the premature
meeting of the two U.S. cracks, Richards and John-
ston. If the draw had been “seeded,” as is done in
every other country but conservative Britain, these
two would probably have met in the final, for, on
current form, Richards was likely to beat everything
in sight, bar his active and expel'ieneed countryman.
Up to encountering Johnston he had knocked out his
opponents in straight sets, and it was expected that

lhe Deacon”: Peter Felix, the old-time
colored bruiser, who was robbed of the heavyweight
championship at Kalgoorlie 22 years ago—a mer-
cenerary ruffian cut the electric-light wires while
the referee was counting Bill Doherty out—is nowa-
aays an actor of sorts. He impersonates a Nubian
in Asche s production of “Chu Chin Chow.” Pecer
owned a dandy left, but his utter lack of ferocity
was against him as a fighter. Never was there a
milder-mannered or better-natured pug. I remember
seeing tnm in a pub at Geelong (Vic.) what time
a nois y navvy, fighting-drunk, was asking for “lash”
of the worst order in captivity. “Come on, yer
big black cow, yelled the navvy. “Come on! I’m
wide open. ’ “Pardon me suh,” said Peter, “pardon
me, and his soft Georgia drawl hadn’t an inflection
of wrath in it. But the drunk persisted, and in the
, , Pe i er was baited into a retort which somehow
ended the argument. It was “Sho’ fly!”
* * * ' *
“Ex-Englishman”: An odd kind of athletic
feat appears in Ralph. Nevill s new book of reminis-
cences, as “the greatest example of bulldog pluck
f ever saw in my life.” It was simply a prolonged
attempt to undress completely while swimming in
the liver Cam at midwinter, 1886. It was the result
of an after-dinner wager between two wild Cambridge
undergraduates, but the trial was made by daylight
and with all parties sober. The swimmer, an Irish-
man, who had had 2 to 1 laid 'him in hundreds,
got his suit, shirt and boots off with little trouble
except for the extreme calld, but the sock.s were
a different matter. One of them resisted all his
efforts, but he would not give in, though steadily
becoming more numb and feeble. The umpires
could see themselves being involved in a man-
slaughter ease, and finally declared all bets off,
dragging the youth into a boat just in time.
“Past Grammar”: The English Rugby
League having withdrawn the two years’ residental
qualification imposed on “Colonial” plavers nearly
four years ago, the export trade in Australian and
M.L. footballers will shortly be resumed. When the
last, lot of Kangaroos were in England, several of them
received offe-s, but*the prospect of having to spend
two years in idleness before thev nut on plaving
togs did not appeal. Now the road is open and the
exodus is about to commerce. The reason for the
change of front is that the Erglish League can-
not raise its own recruits. Confined to a small
portion of Lancashire and Yorkshire, surrounded
bv Soccer and Rugby Union, and with no hold
whatever on the schools, it has had to fill its
vacancies bv mwchasing Rno-bv Union players, mostly
from the Welsh and Midland industrial districts.
This supply seems to have run short, so N.S.W. and
Queensland Leagues are now being looked to for
reinforcements. And they don’t like it a little bit.
“Leagueite”: The Warrington (Eng.) club is
advertising in Sydney for a rearguard. Other agents
of North of England clubs are operating in 'less
spectacular ways, and many more or less prominent
players have been asked to put a price on them-
selves. Some have replied that a thousand down
and a tenner a week may tempt them; but no
business has thus far resulted.
The accompany-
ing likeness is that of
E. Frauenfelder, the
young Ipswich (Q.)
full-back. Sydney fol-
lowers of the Rugby
League game began to
take notice of him in
1922, when he made bis
debut for Queensland
against N. S. Wales,
and his work in the le-
cent games against the
Metropolitan and Ma
State teams delighted
them. it was distin-
guished by perfect anti-
cipation and catching,
together with great
pace and a fondness
for running on with
his backs. A fair
tackier and kick the
young fellow will pro-
bably improve in these
departments. How he
would shape against a
determined pack of iol-
lowing-up tacklers
remains to be seen.
The Sydney men never
tested him in that re-
spect.

men scoring 28 points (6 tries 5 goals) to 5

Lawrence, and they made the mistake of banishing
Gillespie from stand-off half to the wing. They
were never in the hunt. A much more inspiriting
exhibition was provided by North Sydney and New-
to'- "ilu lth sec ?- t 0 g 0 was level Pegging. Then
olinkhorn charged down the left wing, fending,
bumping and dodging, until he was bunged out
near the corner. The Shoremen heeled from the

i weak side and Watkins among the backs,
beat Glebe by 13 points to 3, and Balmain
registered 12 to West’s 5. North Sydney now lead

South Sydney (12), with St. George and Western

A crowd of 15,000 saw the Maoriland
Soccer team win the third Test match, and the
rubber, at Newcastle (N.S.W.), on Saturday. Aus-
tralia had the only goal at half-time, and that
was a lucky one, but after the spell M.L. found the
net four times while Australia failed to score.
George Campbell, the Maoriland captain, got the
who!e_ four. He is the most dashing forward ever
seen m these parts.

Vic. League’s strongest 18 went to Adel-
aide at the week-end with instructions to wipe the
earth with South Australia. But it was the South
Aussies who did the wiping; admirably led by the
younger of the cricketing Richardsons they led in
every quarter, and wound up with 13 goals 14 be-
hinds to 6 goals 9 behinds. Thirty-five thousand cheer-
ing Adelaideans witnessed the massacre. The League’s
second 18 fared better on the Melbourne C.C. ground
against N. S. "Wales, defeating a team from that
State by 14.18 to 13.8. But the visitors made
their conquerors travel, especially in the last
quarter. The Ma Staters don’t indulge in loft}’
marks, and they don’t get rid of the ball quickly ;
also they were uneven; likewise their ruck was out-
played. But Pedler, Dunn and Watson are stars;
and McKoy, Ellis and Ituschert are quite good. The
attendance was 16,370, and the “gate” £7BO.

“Winkle” : Prevented by agreement from
foraging among Association sides Melbourne League
clubs hire stars in other States. Richmond,
slipping from their high position, secured Gordon
Hislop, a back man from Balmain (N.S.W.) ; Loyal
Oakley, a Tassie who played one season with Pad-
dington (N.S.W.) ; McLeod, a South Australian; and
Dave Griffiths, from Kalgoorlie. None of them, how-
ever, came up to specifications, though Griffiths and
Hislop are secure in the team. Fitzroy had more
luck in the draw. They brought Tarbotton, a half-
back, from Sydney, and Les Bryant, follower, from
Norwood (S.A.). Both are topnotchers. From Nor-
wood Carlton have lured Hart, a forward, who last
year topped the S. Aus. list with 60 goals; and from
the Speck they have secured Goodrick and Pringle,
six-footers and heavyweights both. The club is
hoping that Goodrick and Pringle will be as compe-
itnwf„iXale"tln?u an . d , Cl i allis ’ a P air of champions
it brought from the island 10' years ago.

„ .The first round of club football in Adelaide
ru or "i° 0( ’ gear's premiers, without a loss
and Glenelg without a win. North Adelaide are a
moderate second, Sturt and South Ade’aide coming
next. Pori: Adelaide are unaccountably out of form.
The main feature of the season so far has been
unusual mud ; the umpire in an Oval match, drop-
ping his whistle, was unable to get a sound out of
the mud-clogged thing when he recovered it, and
had to hold up the play till he could secure a fresh
one.

If a walker is included in Australia’s team
for the Olympic Games, Ernie Austen, of Sydney, will
probably be the man. On Saturday he won a three-
mile handicap from scratch in 23min. 39sec. On
June 23 he collected the N.S.W. seven-miles title
stepping four miles in 31min. 43sec„ five in 39min!
47 l-ssec., six in 47min. 51 4-ssee., and seven in
oormn. 49 l-ssec. Austen’s time for seven miles is
a long way below the World’s record, 50min
40 4-ssec., but he shapes like a man who will im-
prove.

Do YOU KNOW WHY
THE 6 EAR-SHIFT IS DIFFERENT?
The design of Dodge Brothers gear-shift takes into con-
sideration the natural inclinations of the driver.
To start, you throw the lever forward. To reverse, you
pull the lever backward. And when the car is running
in high gear—which is about ninety per cent, of the time
the lever is in a forward position, out of the way,
where it does not interfere with passengers, robes or
luggage.
Moreover, the transmission, developed and patented by
Dodge Brothers, is so designed that the countershaft
used in intermediate speeds and in reverse —is discon-
nected when the car is in high. There are no gears in
mesh. Power is transmitted directly from clutch to
rear axle.
This exclusive feature prevents the loss of power through
friction, reduces gear-box noises and eliminates a vast
amount of wear.
That is why the gear-shift of Dodge Brothers Motor Car
is different.
Dodge Brothers Motor Cars are manufactured in the
following types: Five-seater Touring, Two-Seater Road-
ster, Business Coupe, Business Sedan, Sedan De-Luxe.
Commercial Types from i ton to 1 2 ton, suitable for
practically every kind of business transportation.

THE INKY WAY.
“Adelaide”: S.A. Hansard staff has contributed
another man (making- the sixth) to the Common-
wealth staff. The migration is likely to continue
while the State pays its leaders of staff just about
what the Commonwealth pays its staff-men.
J. E. Davidson, who expected to hear his new
afternoon paper cried in the Adelaide streets in April,
has bright hopes now of seeing the first issue out
before August. There have been maddening delays
in the delivery of machinery parts from the other
side of the water.
Maurice Hewlett, who passed out last month at 62,
was the author of one remarkably fine novel, “The
Forest Lovers,” which had a great vogue more than
20 years ago, and may still be found in the libraries.
Though a fairly prolific writer of fiction he nevei
repeated the success of this work. He wrote a few
volumes of essays which showed that he possessed a
wide range of culture, and his scholarly criticisms
of books in the Memoirs and Biography section were
a feature of the London Mercury. His last article
appeared as recently as April.
“M.D.”: Julien Viaud (“Pierre Loti”), who ha:
just died at Paris at the age of 73, tried his ’prentice
hand as an author with a description of our Pacific-
neighbor, Easter Island. It was a very modest MS.
indeed, and bore the title, “Easter Island: the Diary
of a Non-commissioned Officer of the Frigate La
Flore.” This was published in L’lllustration of
August 17, 1872. In the second instalment the
writer signed himself “Julien Viaud, midshipman.’
It was not until the publication of his Tahitian yarn
in 1878 (though the scene is laid six years earlier),
“Le Mariage de Loti,” that he adopted the pseudo-
nym which his writings were to make famous.
“Gallery”: Willie Brennan has taken the seat
Maling relinquished in the Federal gallery', and is
writing the weekly sketch for the Argus. He has
revived Willoughby’s headline “Above the Speaker,”
changing the pen-name to “Ariel.” W.B. only found
his true vocation when he turned his back on the
State income-tax and railway offices to try his luck
on the press. His first big engagement was to report
Irvine when the Iceberg delivered his “No Surrender
speech at Warragul slightly over 20 years ago, what
time the Uppah Chambah was mauling the Reform
Bill. In 10 years he rose to be ehief-of-staff, and
then came his" appointment as second, and finally as
first, leader-writer. He is one of the wits of the
Yorick Club, and couldn’t write stodge if he tried.
He can say bright and piquant things in print, not-
withstanding his respect for Tory traditions; but
he doesn’t scratch.
“The Deacon”: Recently the Newcastle Herald
printed among its In Memoriam notices this slab of
grief and recrimination : —-
“Lonely years we spent together,
Only God can tell.
In life we loved you, Auntie ;
In death we do the same.
Not like those who in life did not want you ;
But in death took.advantage of your weakness.
And robbed the fatherless children you dearly loved
and helped to rear.”
The extraordinary effusion was signed by the lady
allegedly robbed, and caused her brother “great pain
of mind” and all the other things necessary to
support a demand for £4OO damages for defamation.
The Judge exhorted the pair not to hold a wash-day-
in court, but the lady being adamant he assessed
the “pain of mind” etc., at 40 bob !
“Macquarie-street”: Galsworthy, at 56, still in
harness and at the height perhaps of his fame, n>
superintending a magnificient edition ot his wonts
in 21 volumes. This edition is cheap at 25 guineas,
as it is limited to 500 sets, which are bound to
go up in price and may reach 50 guineas within a
year of publication. Galsworthy is the most uncom-
municative soul alive, and is a bit of a hermit
at his beautiful home at Hampstead; but m the
“Manaton” edition he comes out ot his shell
aiid discusses the genesis of his most important
novels and plays in 16 new prefaces. The novel
“Jocelyn” (1899) is the only one to be scrapped.
He is the most popular living English author with
the French and is always lionised when he visits
La Ville Lumiere.
“Clifford C.”: Yes, all censors are aggravating,
and the one who won’t explain why he censors is
exasperating. And he is so common as to tie mo
the' rule than the exception. As an instance, ' the
other day the R.C. authority which attends to these
matters put the ban of the Church on the works of
Anatole France. No reason was assigned, and the
name of the individual who set the wheels in motion
is a mystery. Anatole France is "0 comparatively
new writer like Dr. Stopes, whom our Customs won t
pass; his works have been on the market sine
1868, so either the Vatican is slow for jt ® «
spasmodic or freakish. And a habit of that sort
is likelv to cause trouble. For instance Melbourne
University had prescribed a tome containing so.
of Anatole’s writings as a text-book in one of
examinations; so Archbishop M-anmx was driven to
grant a dispensation, else R.C. students woul
been handicapped. But the Vatican has been doing
things like that for over 35-0 years and getti g
more explanatory.

THE REAL AUTHOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sweet flowers rise from bitter seed,
Grim causes fair occurrence breed,
Delights evolve from sorrow ;
The artist may condemn his chain,
But myriad offspring of the brain
Are born because (alas, again!)
The rent is due to-morrow.
As pearls proclaim the oyster’s dole,
So many a bard pours forth his soul
Because he’s on his uppers.
Oft when the rhymers tune their lyres
The menu, not the muse, inspires;
Inflamed by mere Tuckerian fires
They’re singing for their suppers.
The wolf puts Pegasus a-wing
And stirs the clogged Pierian spring
To set its silver flowing.
From duns much art the poet learns,
And many an ode that throbs and burns
is, like the postal-note it earns,
All to the butcher owing.
So when, enthralled by some sweet lay,
You twine appreciative bay,
Ere you acclaim the poet, stay,
The facts examine closer.
He merely sang; then let your view
Pass on to what compelled him to.
The honor give where most ’tis due,
And laureate his grocer.

Lydia Lipkovska trailed a cloud of glory
against a black velvet background on the
Sydney Town Hall stage on Friday night.
A dazzling blonde, the lady has polished her
natural charm to jewel-brilliance. Her
rounded slimness was clothed in a kind of
emancipated harem frock of gold and rose
tissue, with floating side panels of black and
gold, and she added a devastating flame-
colored fan to her already complete armory.
Having pleased the eye, the artist set about
capturing the ear. This she did from the open-
ing notes of the Glinka number, Cavatina
jnd Rondo, from “The Life for the
Tsar.” The voice proved to hold the trill-
ing rapture that the publicity man had
claimed. It has a cleaving lightness. It
breaks in a shower of laughing notes as in
the fascinating “Bolero” (Delibes didn’t
write it quite like that, but Lydia Lipkovska
is absolutely the laughing girl of Cadiz),
or is filled with sadness, as in Tosti's “I
“ TANGERINE ,” AT MELBOURNE
PRINCESS'S.
Mark Daly does a little bull-fighting.
Weep.” With the Chopin encore, “La Tris-
tesse,” she held her audience even more than
with the difficult Bell Song from “Lakme”
or the familiar Waltz Song from “Romeo and
Juliet.” The singer is happy in her accom-
panist, Alexander Sverjensky, who showed
himself a capable pianist in his solo numbers.
* * * *
At the Monday night concert the Russian
lady won more southern laurels. The “Tra-
viata” number was an overwhelming suc-
cess ; the singer flashed out a stream of
sparkling sound with a splendid recklessness
that only youth can know. But a poignant
Tschaikowsky number and the repeated
Chopin’s “Sadness” reached the artistic
heights of the evening.
The brief return season of “The Peep
Show” Sydney Royal terminates on
Friday. The peeps (17 in all) are full of
piquancy and clever craftsmanship. One
misses Fred Cambourne, whose portrayal of
Dickens’s Fagin was such a memorable per-
formance when the company was last here ;
as a sr-t-off, old favorite Jack Cannot is
a marked improvement on the rather indif-
ferent comedian whom he has displaced.
* * * *
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney: Two nights,
no more, for glad encore, and then the long,
long run is o’er; this finishes the tally. For
half-a-year she’s queened it here, vivacious,
chic, delightful, dear, entrancing, saucy
“Sally.” To Josie M., that radiant gem, it's
au revoir! Adieu pro tem.l Just for a
season, Vale!

Gertrude Elliott (Lady Forbes-Robertson)
and her English company are delivering their
rather sobful goods to thoroughly apprecia-
tive houses at Sydney Cri. “Woman to
Woman” is, as the name implies, a play of
which the appeal is mainly directed to the
sex which brushes its hair backwards and
powders its nose, but it contains some strong
situations capably presented.
** * *
Complaints against the Sydney Tivoli’s
stage-doorkeeper for allowing Herschei Hen-
lere and Audrey Knight to disappear into
the gloom are somewhat mitigated by his
admission of the Big Four and Eileen and
Marjorie. The male quartette don’t make
the best of their ragtime job, but with a
little adzing of their stuff they will reach
the headlines; Eileen and Marjorie, the
nearly-grown-up “Tiny Tots” of the past,
display their lightning acrobatics, including
compound catherine-wheels and other com-
plications. Yankee author-actor Alan Brooks
and his engaging Sydney wife, Eileen Robin-
son, have been winning approval in the four-
cameo-acts sketch, “Dollars and Sense” ; and
on the lady’s withdrawal to take a va-cation
Phyllis May stepped into her place. (Phyllis
is Neville Mayman’s only chick ; and Eileen
is the big joy of Sydney map-maker Robin-
son.) Bert Harrow, an English-fun-hawker,
is amusing, and Vaude and Verne purvey
patter, antique and recent.
#* * *
Sydney Lyceum is handling crowds of cir-
culating-library fiends that are descending
upon the Pitt-street house to view “The Pri-
soner of Zenda.” To add to the dainty
usherettes’ bewilderment Ben Turpin is kick-
ing up a dust as “The Shriek of Araby,” and
the swivel-eyed Benno has a mighty follow-
ing. Between times Allan Priora soothes
the savage breast with tenor warblings. The
Strand is demonstrating how Dorothy Dalton
can share a “Dark Secret,” and for the
benefit of hard-up parents it also features
the pawning of a small infant for five dol-
lars. (But who in Australia would want
to do that when a fiver is paid, spot cash,
for the latest arrival?) The respective
merits of jockeys Munro and Toohey are
not under discussion at the Lyric, but it’s
a packed show, all the same. The white
linen at the Majestic supports O. Henry’s
“Cabbages and Kings,” almost unrecognis-
able under the title of “Fortune’s Mask.”
“The Dingo” has escaped to the Empress,
wTere also the junior population may learn
the dubious moral attached to an epic in
bigamy. “Oliver Twist,” bovrilised, is still
the Crystal Palace’s siren call. “The Chris-
tian,” five times daily, at the Globe, con-
tinues to wage a futile battle with Mam-
mon. only to be stoned to the Golden Gate
at the fade-out.

A show with promise in it: —
L. R. Eldershaw’s exhibition at Giayfleld Shaw’s
galleries in Sydney revealed a considerable two years’
development. In his latest work there is less evidence
of his early love for pretty color and more evidence
of a greater interest in the painting of light. If he
contented himself wholly with that problem and
dropped water-color for the less limited medium of
oils, his further development would probably be
more rapid. Still we should lose something. A
half-dozen of his best in this show give great pro-
mise, and. incidentally, set out to challenge the
place of Heysen as our most capable water-colorist.
* * sj: *
“If Winter Comes” is still trying hard at
Melbourne Royal to make itself intelligible-to
those who haven’t read the novel, and to pacify
those readers who find the book irritating in
its pretence of probability. As a pacifier
the play is a dead failure, of course. It
gives no hint of what is poetically idealistic
in the book, whereas it introduces whiffs of
intrigue into Mark Sabre’s home while stop-
ping short of the thorough-paced melodrama
it might have been. For instance, some-
thing might have been made of the incident
of the death of old Mrs. Perch, by whose
bedside Mark Sabre is said to have heard the
voices of the lady and her son (just killed in
the war) engaged in animated conversation.
At any rate, Mark heard the voice of young
Perch speaking from Spookland to his dying
mother. Why omit this “seance” from a
drama which is in sore need of something
mystical and creepy? And why omit Mark’s
stroke of paralysis in the office where
Twyning has so contemptibly robbed him of
liis revenge? The stroke would have pro-
vided a good old effective curtain, or “black-
out,” to be followed by a brief bedroom scene
illustrating Mark’s joyful recovery in the
arms of his converted Nona-. For in the
book, if not in the play, Lady Tybar ivas a
convert. Mark had made her better than
she would have been had his name been
Jack and his morals merely so-so. She

Arthur Stigant as Otto Spreckles, Impres-
ario, meets Leslie Holland, the Gover-
nor of Binsk.
Mark merely ignored the request The play
gives no idea of this one-sided virtuousness.
It sketchily suggests a sly though innocuous
flirtation between Mark and the lady so
fancifully fond of him. And it leaves a
proportion of the audience too tired to guess
at much that is never explained.

“Rockets,” bringing back the Pounds
Sisters, will revive the mixed glories of revue
at Melbourne Palace on Saturday.
At Melbourne King’s the talk is of Harry
Lauder. The tuneful little comedian with
the unprecedented legs starts his Melbourne
season on Saturday in time to permit a
turn at a Majesty’s matinee on Monday.
* ii: *
No more warm greetings of Moiseiwitsch
will thaw the ice in the Melbourne Town
Hall atmosphere alter to-day (Thursday).
His success has been great, despite a dim
musical suspicion that Melbourne cold some-
times struck to the very soul of the artistic
piano, and entered into his.
Melbourne, having loved Hugh Ward’s first
show at the Princess’s for its gaiety and
brightness, is doing likewise with “Tanger-
ine.” Nor has the city’s heart yet : grown
weary of the subject matter common to “Tan-
gerine” and “The O’Brien Girl.” Love, mar-
riage and divorce —especially divorce —pro-
vide all the plot for the present “musical
comedy-satire,” wherein music is to the
comedy as the flimsiest fabric of ham to the
stoutest casings of bread. The plot never
diverges from the primrose path of dalliance,
divorce and polygamy, with reconciliation
shining in the distance And the chorus,
which ofttimes has something to do with the
plot, never ceases to be a joy. A cynic for-
gives what is weakest in “Tangerine” for
the good humor it diffuses, and the particular
charm of three different types of dancing-
experts. The lithe gracefulness of dainty
Mamie Watson and Hazel Harris is not more
beautifully artistic than the agility of June
Roberts, whose toe-dancing revives memo-
ries of Genee. Considered even from the test-
point of a matinee when May Beatty was
not appearing, the new bill at Melbourne
Princess’s is evidently in for a long life and
a gay one. May’s tall understudy answered
to requirements, and looked quite all right.
*!* sjc sjc
“Sybil” is expected to last at Melbourne
Majesty’s until it is time to close the theatre
for re-construction. But acquaintance does
not ripen one’s regard for “Sybil.” On the
contrary, it turns the regard rather sour in
searching for something of individuality in
the easy flow of music, or the rendering of
it. The utter unreality of all the situations
is a serious defect, whilst the want of ballet
and the monotony of scenic “interiors” help
to make it different from many musical snows
—in a wrong sort of way. Cecil Bradley,
who played the Grand Duchess part when
the show opened at Adelaide, has been re-
storeu to the cast; and there’s that improve-
ment, anyhow.
‘•Dark Secrets,” at Hoyt’lS, Melbourne,
compels the most ardent hand-holders to
break apart and take notice of the struggle
of Dorothy Dalton to escape the machina-
tions of a wicked occultist, Mohamed Ali.
Frank Mayo’s evil temper nearly blisters
the celluloid in “The Flaming Hour” which
follows on. The poor gyurl who though beauti-
ful is honest is given another chance to be
original in “The Dari ng of the It-ch” at the
Majestic. Betty Blythe is the beauteous
excuse for this variation on a hackneyed
theme. A Zane Grey masterpiece dribbles
over the manchester under the title of “When
Romance Rides,” and another good-looker,
Claire Adams, is the siren of the occasion,
“Thorns and Orange Blossoms” babbles of
vampire love at the Britannia, and the same
sort of emotion is on tap in “A Fool There
Was” at the Melba,

Two Melbourne shows of paint;-
R. McCann’s latest salute to the doctrines of Max
Meldrum amounts to 90 pictures in the north gal-
lery of the Vic. Artists’ Society. But much as one
sympathises with the artist’s aims, it would be
generous to say that 60 per cent, of his efforts ate
really worth while. Actually a smaller proportion
of his pictures show a satisfying achievement, ahd
most of these are moderate-sized impressions of the
type of No, 39, wherein the qualities of space and
atmosphere are realised. In larger productions, like
“Mount Roland and the Mersey, Tasmania" (No.
79), the effect is flat. His still lifes, “Roses” and
the beautifully painted “Chrysantheihuirts” (No.
61), are entitled to something approaching enthusi-
asm, but he hasn’t done so well in the parade of
vegetables in No. 69. As for portraiture, he ought
to refrain from exhibiting until he can present
something more arresting than the wooden lady in
red who clutches the blue bowl in No. 58. “Freddie”
(No. 88) is not much more en'Chaiiting, though
Freddie’s hands do look like genuine flesh and blood.
A well-written Fbreword on the catalogue of
Charles Bryant’s exhibition at the Melbourne Athe-
n;eum mentions that he was a “pupil of Julius
Oisson, R.A., at that painter’s famous St. Ives
school.’’ This fact is apparent in two or three can-
vases, wherein Bryant romantically emphasises the
mother-of-pearl shimmer of moonshine on water, all
curled and flouncing in the approved Olsson manner.
These pictures have a disposition to prettiness that
must inevitably attract the “sweet tooths” among
local connoisseurs, and the same opinion might be
delivered of sundry other efforts in which the might
of the British Navy is rather fulsomely recognised.
Artistically there is no reason why an artist
shouldn’t paint battlecruisers in preference to, say,
pumpkins or twilights, but one can’t refrain from
saying that Bryant’s depiction of warships is in-
vested with a sentimental suggestiveness that true;
art doesn’t recognise. Look at the pomp and cir-
cumstance of “H.M.S. Renown Leaving Portsmouth,”
It Is a purely literary effusion on the lines of a
magazine illustration. Take again “Full Speed
Ahead,” and herein even the dancing opalescent
water seems affected by the excitement of the
occasion. “H.M.S. Lion (coming into action With
the German Fleet, May 81, 1916)” is another of
the same sort. Instead of inviting attention to the
picture as a whole the artist concentrates theatri-
cally on the shell-spouts in the foreground, producing
a bit of pictorial journalism devoid of anything but
patriotic interest. Of his" undramatie waterscapes —
as, for example, “The Incoming Tide” and “Looking
North from Austinmer” —the verdict is more favor-
able. Indeed, one lingers about them with a feeling
of relief. (

Divide the leisure of the day.
A brown bird in a green tree sings;
Through ferns and stones a stream shrills clear,
A butterfly spreads golden wings,
And Amaryllis hovers near.

SYDNEY’S SENSATION!

s
UCH SAVINGS!
On J une 22 Murdoch s commenced the biggest clearance in the history of
the firm—the disposal of £60,000 Winter Stock—regardless of cost.
The drastic cut in prices produced a wonderful response—orders showering in from all parts
of the Commonwealth.
Of course many lines were rapidly sold out —that was unavoidable. Enormous reserve stocks,
however, are coming up for speedy clearance and will provide even greater money-scuings.

THE FACE POWDER
de Luxe
“Fax”: Song recitals by individual stars,
not to mention concerts where the chief
vocalist invkriably sings twice as much as
the programme promises, have destroyed the
old special market value of encore numbers.
Half-a-century ago Adelina Patti’s fee was
£2OO for a couple of principal numbers, plus
£3O each for two encores, which were popu-
lar ballads. If her throat was rather “off,”
and she chose to refuse an encore, she could
deny herself the extra £3O without breaking
her contract. aims Reeves in his prime
used to contract to sing two songs, and de-
manded a double fee for the inevitable encore.
This goes to explain why he often failed to
respond when the audience roared for more.
It is on record that a hard-up manager who
contracted to pay Reeves's fee wrote to him :
“No encores, or I shall be ruined.”
“Dido”: “Quarantine,” which Melbourne
has just finished with, is about the worst-
made play of any pretentiousness that I re-
member. It proceeds in a series of bounds
and bumps, and it is talky in the worst sense,
even though an occasional epigram illumines
JUST TO BREAK THE MONOTONY.
SHIM: “You might occasionally change your
style of dancing .”
HIM: “How do you mean?”
SHIM: “Well, you could step sometimes on
my left foot.”
the gloom like a firefly might the interior of
Cheops. The unsatisfactory hero is always
on the point of behaving shockingly to the
heroine, but never goes beyond rudeness,
much to the disgust of an expectant audi-
ence, and apparently to the grave dissatisfac-
tion of the lady. Anyhow, that young person
betrays the utmost pique after a scene in
which the hero was expected to behave out-
rageously and didn’t. It is a play of desul-
tory doings and thwarted expectations, end-
ing in a marriage which would have ren-
dered an absurd play wholly superfluous if
it had only come on two acts earlier, a con-
summation which would inevitably have hap-
pened had the characters been reasonably
sane.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : My first tour was with
Charlie MacMahon, and within six weeks
lie had asked me to blend my exertions in
the cause of Art with the job of assistant-
manager. He mentioned a 50 per cent rise
as an inducement, and no lost time. That
was a consideration, as the travelling pro.
may earn only a week’s salary—six nights’
performances—in a fortnight or even more.
“And, my boy,” said Charles, impressively,
“being assistant manager, you'll get it!” I
had grown older in the business before I
realised the importance of that.
“Mancam” : Mrs. Brough’s name is mostly
associated with “intellectual” comedy or
drama, but in her burlesque and opera
bouffe days she played many-out-of-the-way
parts. Can you imagine her, for instance,
in the bifurcated, swallow-tailed and shirt-
fronted evening-dress of the Spider in “The
Silver King”? It was in a travesty called'
"Silver Guilt” —or, perhaps, it was Gilt—
at the Melbourne Opera House. Brough
was the Wilfrid Donefor of the piece, which
was a rather poor parody, and soon died.
“Second Murderer” : The compliment paid
by the Sydney Institute of Journalists to
Nellie Stewart and Mrs. Brough has evoked
a lot of inexact flattery. F’rinstance, it has
been said that Miss Stewart began in comic
opera, and Mrs. Brough in comedy and
drama. Really it’s the other way round.
Nellie Stewart’s theatrical career began
when she wrns an infant, and appeared with
Charles Kean. Later she played Sam Wil-
loughby in “The Ticket-of-Leave Man.” Mrs.
Brough and Emma Temple began—in Aus-
tralia —as singers in comic opera and bur-
lesque. Their first appearance was in
"lolanthe,” in which they were both fairies.
Oddly enough, Nellie Avas in the same show
as prima donna. The following production
was “La Fille du Tambour Major,” in which
the three ladies were again associated, and
Robert Brough was the drum-major. That
happened 38 years ago.
“Santander”: There must be something
in Bolshevism, after all. Anyhow, without
the Bolshie practice of chasing Russian
musical geniuses over the frontier, as broad-
casted by industrious press-agents, we should
never have heard of virtuosos who invade
this country at the rate of three or four a
year. Was it not Jascha Spivakovsky—or
was it Bascha Sniffoviteh ? —who, with his
father, mother, sisters and grand-parents,
walked from Sebastopol to Orenburg in the
depth of winter, pursued by Red Guards
foaming at the knout? They escaped by
some miracle, and were picked up by one
of the Tait advance-agents someAvhere on
the Amur River, Bascha still clinging to his
priceless Gammonerius, which he had re-
fused to pawn to buy the family bread. Now
there is Lipkovska, who, I gather, was sing-
ing at the Imperial Opera House, Petrograd,
when the Revolution broke out, and she had
to run for her life. Heaven knows what'
privations the lady endured crossing the
steppes, or the Volga, or something, in her
endeavor to reach civilisation; but with
amazing good fortune she collided with a'
Tait representative and her vocal organ is
now on exhibition. The Taits’ rescue work
deserves to be acclaimed. No firm has been
more assiduous in helping starving musicians
ruined by the brutal attentions of Trotsky
and co.
“Private Boxer” : Michael Morton, author
of “Woman to Woman,” now on view at
Sydney Criterion, is a plodding playright
who, although he never achieved greatness,
has been responsible for many money-making
pieces. His “Yellow Ticket” was done here
a few years ago with Muriel Starr as the
heroine; and, going further back, he Avas
the adapter of Tolstoi’s “Resurrection,” in
Avhich Julius Knight iand Maud Jeffries
played the leads. But, there, I don’t sup-
pose anybody is interested in the authorship
of plays noAvadays.
“L.H.P.”: Clay Greene (B. 7/6/’23) Avas
not the actual author of “Struck. Oil.” This
is how its origin was described by a news-
paper during the Williamsons’ season in Mel-
bourne in the early ’eighties:—
While Mr. Ayilliamson was resident in San Fran-
cisco, a rugged Californian miner, Sam Smith by
name, called upon him to submit a drama for his
approval. It was too crude to be made anything of,
and was declined, but the Avriter was asked if he
had anything else. Yes, there was another piece,
entitled “The Deed: or Five Years Away,” which the
playwright had more than once thought of putting-
in the fire. In the principal character, John Stofel
by name, the actor saw the makings of an effective
part, and with the assistance of the author and a
friend [presumably Clay Greene] Mr. Williamson suc-
ceeded in engrafting on to the drama the character
now played by his wife. The piece, having been
purchased, was first produced at Slalt Lake City,
and a new third act was devised for it by Mr.
Williamson.
“Struck Oil” ran for seven weeks at Mel-
bourne Royal on its first Australian produc-
tion in 1574. After Sydney and Adelaide
had been exhausted, for the time being,
J.C.W. and his wife left Australia for India
£15,000 richer than when they landed here.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Rignold was a hard
taskmaster. When a slovenly performance
infuriated him he would order an after-the-
show rehearsal; and how the victims were
to get home did not worry him a bit. Pos-
sibly “the Guv’nor” took it for granted that
mummers always lived near their job,
although he, being the boss, cpuld afford the
luxury of living in some place he considered
“right out” —for example, Underwood-street,
Paddington. One unforgotten rehearsal
lasted so long that Rignold, relenting, in-
vited the whole company to breakfast. It
followed an opening night of “Henry V.,”
when everything had gone wrong, even the
limelight. That was the occasion, so often
written about, when the conquest of France
was suspended while the King, in a voice of
thunder, ordered one of his minions to “Put
the blanky light on me, you fool, not on the
blanky horse!”
HIS CROWNING ORNAMENT.
“He’s got a fine head”
“Yes, he ought to have; it’s brand-new — he’s never used it.”
“Jamwood”: Rignold’s roll (B. 28/6 /’2"
was declared at £ll,OOO. "Tidy” enough as
actors’ estates go, but small compared with
Williamson’s £l93,ooo—George never en-
joyed Jimmy’s commercial advantages. Of
dead mummers associated with Australia
during the past 20 years, the wealthiest was
11. B. Irving, who willed his widow £39,000.
Waller, whom most people would have pro-
nounced the richer man, left no more than
£5845. Haddon Chambers figures respect-
ably among the dramatic authors with a
total of £9195. He must have made a pot
of money out of “The Tyranny of Tears”
and “Captain Swift,” but his later plays
couldn’t have turned him in much, and the
man was always a free, not to say reck-
less, spender—except where some of his own
people were concerned.
“Nero” : Melbourne for bithness, Adelaide
for culchaw, but Auckland (M.L.) for meti-
culous enforcement of the law. When the
Emelie Polini co. arrived at Kipling’s “last,
loneliest, loveliest,” it had among its props
an automatic pistol used in “The Flaw.”
It was declared at the Customs, but the
police decreed that it could not remain in
the country, but must be sent back to Aus-
tralia. So the s. : m. had to take the weapon
to the p.o. and post it back, and a John
Hop accompanied him to see that it was
properly started on the journey.
As one gentleman to another: —
One of the characters in “Quarantine” is a press-
man. True, he is an American, but there is no
reasonable excuse for making even an American
pressman a jackass and a bounder. We are used to
seeing the journalist savaged on the stage. It looks
as if dramatic authors, when they use a newspaper
man, are struggling to get even for all the detest-
able things pressmen have written about their most
obnoxious plays. But the thought suggested by this
“Quarantine” idiot is that the author (or authors,
as the ease may be) anticipated that their bad play
would be slated by the critics, and got in a jolt in
advance. The pressman employed is not merely a
fool, he is an obstreperous bore, with no more man-
ners and less sensibility than a he-goat. And, after
all, the journalist is own brother to the dramatist,
so these family exposures are—well, injudicious.
“0.K.”: The success in London of recent
“Sweet Lavender” revivals suggests that
Pinero’s humorous-cum-melodramatie comedy
might stand revival here. It is a compara-
tively inexpensive piece to stage, but it needs,
of course, a carefully-chosen co. Brough
and Boucicault introduced it to Australia in
their early days of management, when Lilian
Gilmour, as the light comedy girl, was an
important item. That was the time when
Frank Thornton, the unoriginal comedian,
played Dick Phenyl in such careful mimicry
of Edward Terry that the “creator” of the
character was a comparative failure when he
came to play it in Australia. An odd fea-
ture of the B. and B. production in Mel-
bourne was the printing of the programme in
lavender on a lighter lavender ground. In
the result the names were almost illegible.
London Era reports that Connie Ediss
is writing a play and hopes to be accepted
as a serious actress. But this may be only
a puff for Connie, who has been running her
own little co. in a vaudeville sketch at the
London halls.
“E.T.” : The muffled stranger gazed sorrow-
fully at the builder’s laborers hard at work
demolishing the old playhouse. His sighs
could be heard a block away. “Vandals!”
he huskily murmured. “Soon there will be
nothing left. The scene of my many tri-
umphs will be but a memory. Ter-agic—
ter-agic!” Shiver-
ing as though with
ague, he walked
round to the side
street where the
stage entrance used
to be. That part
of the building was
as yet intact.
Some of the letters
of the words that
once spelt “Stage
Door” could still
be deciphered.
Pausing at - the
portal, past which
he had so often
stalked in the deah
old days, he gave
a knock, hardly ex-
pectant of an an-
swer. The door
opened, and a
dusty dame with
“caretaker” writ-
ten all over her ap-
peared and asked
his business. “I
have no business,
madam,” said the
stranger; “I have
been abroad for
yeahs, and was
just giving a last
look at the deah
old place where 1
have acted many a
time and oft, when
Macready Garrick -
fer g u s was a
household word in
this part of the
world, when” “Garrickfergus, did
you say? You are Mr. Macready Garrick-
fergus?” almost shrieked the old woman.
“God bless us! Don’t you remember me —
Dorothy Hambone? Why, when you played
Archibald Carlyle in ‘East Lynne’ here in
1876 I was your ‘Little Willie’!”
“Hainfat”: In my time I have had some
trying press notices, but the one that left
the deepest wound was this: “The rescue
party was led by an idiot of a Welsh ser-
geant, adequately represented by Mr.
Horatio Hamfat.” What barbed the shaft
was the knowledge that the journal which
delivered it didn’t know there was a barb.
“T. 0.1.”: No one who saw G. V. Brooke
act could ever forget him. To me there was
never anyone like him but Salvini, whom 1
saw years afterwards, when Brooke had
long been dead. It was in 1879, at a matinde
for members of the profession. Drury Lane
was crammed with an enthusiastic audience
of literary men, actors and dramatic critics,
and the performance of “Othello” took five
hours, so many were the recalls between the
acts and so prolonged the applause. Salvini
had a great head and a splendid voice, like
Brooke, and one might have fancied he had
studied Brooke’s methods, even to the walk,
though, as far as I know, they never met.
I saw Brooke play “Othello” on a Saturday
night in the old Melbourne Royal. So elab-
orately w r as the thing done that it was mid-
night before the curtain fell on the last act.
The afterpiece had to be abandoned, though
one newspaper critic reported it as having-
been played and gave Harwood beans for his
acting.
“Norbell”: I have suffered under many
illiterate, as well as many pedantic, theatri-
cal “producers” in my time, but little Solly
Jacobs was the strictest purist of them all.
We were rehearsing “Hunted Down; or the
Crime of the Crossroads,” and I had to refe>-
to one Abraham. Solly explained how I
ought to do it. “That there name’s sounded
like ‘A-brum,’ ” he said. I ventured to ex-
postulate. “No fear,” insisted Solly, “that
there name’s Yiddish, and surely you know
that the ‘ham’ is always silent in Yiddish?”
“Billo C.” : In the list of pungent theat-
rical criticisms this seems worthy of honor-
able mention. It is from a notice by Dorothy
Parker, an American critic, concerning a
N’York production of “The Dancing Girl”:
The lady playing the title rOle is imported for the
occasion. Her name is Trini. She is reported to he
the most beautiful woman in Spain. This explains
why King Alphonso spends so much of his time in
Deauville.

Farm
yet Work in the City.
The farming investment is widely recog-
nised as one of the soundest of ventures for
one’s money, but many people, while being
aware of this, are unable to personally devote
their time to Agricultural and Pastoral pursuits.
For this reason the “Calliungal” Cotton and
Mixed Farming Estate offers an exceptional
opportunity.
£ 100 deposit will secure a good farm on this famous Daw-
son Valley Estate (approximately 80 to 100 acres in extent),
which will be worked for purchasers on the Share-farming
System. With about 50 acres devoted to Cotton, and the
remaining area to Dairying and Cereals, a portion of a
purchaser’s annual profit is able to pay off the farm and
show a handsome income as well.
Terms 10 p.c. deposit and 5 annual instalments at
5 p.c.
Local farmers and experienced Cotton-growers are
now waiting and ready to commence work on purchasers’
farms.

Reg - . L. (“Snowy”) Baker can help you to a full realisation
of the joy of life, if you take up his
POSTAL COURSE OF HEALTH AND
STRENGTH CULTURE.
It is emphatically not a “strong-man” course, but a
series of simple, enjoyable, graduated exercises that will
bring into play the neglected muscles, steady the nerves,
help you to breathe and develop properly, and make all
the organs of the body perform their functions correctly.
No apparatus is required and each lesson is graded to
suit particular individual requirements.
“Snowy” Baker has written a most interesting Booklet,
“Health and Strength from Self-Culture,” which tells
all about the course and contains many valuable hints.

Percy Pop: You’ve missed it, somehow.
. ...8.0.T.: It’s got sore feet, and a .weak back and
its blood runs very 510 w... .Coo-ee: Kosciusko is said
to be 6510 ft. high and Bogong (Vic.) 6508 ft. ; Mt.
Cook (M.L.) is just about double the height of
either.... Billjim Backblocks: But you don’t think
The Bulletin is particularly proud of the times
when it has been on the side of the majority, do
you ?.... A.T.C.: We’ve sent it to the writer —that
seemed the most likely way to get something done...
Good Aussie: According to Webster the word
“merino” is pure Spanish and means “moving from
pasture to pasture.”... .H.F.R.: There is humor;
but you have left too many of the marks of the
workshop on it.... Yard: Throwing mud at the coun-
try where you were born won’t make you a better
Australian... .Tantalus: Name and address of the
man, please, so that we may verify some of the
statements... .T.8.L.: You had a pretty good skele-
ton ; but you’ve made a poor fist at dressing it....
Reductio Ada: You’re jazzing on the wrong man’s
neck. . . .Senojo: “Dawn” won’t rhyme with “morn”
any better in the winter than in the summer.. . .Isabel
F.: Looks as though it was written by a very excited
spider with a little help from an agitated centipede.
.... Mary M.: Mostly a patch-work of commonplaces.
. . . .G.L. (Chatswood) : To be quite frank, it is not
verse... .J.8.M.: Not exactly “trash,” but they don’t
show much 5ki11.... Arouet M.: Pretty crude....
L’oiseau: Commonplace carved in w00d... .Joyce L.:
A weak little flutter. .. .W.J.W.: You only say
things as you have heard others say them. Crank
your own intelligence and give it a run.... Bur -
rundie.... Weak every way.... P.D.G.: Ditto....
C.8.A.: Not quite enough in it for general con-
sumption. .. .W.M.F.: Both miss, but not by much.
.... Adodybous: An old idea that has been worked
hard... .E.R.N.: You must put better work into
it than that.... Henry L.: It is only rhymed prose.
. ...Ono: You got on board a. train! Well, well!
.... Sulcus: Too long-drawn-out and wordy.... Park
M.: A sad sort of mirth ; but the “Scotty” who talks
bad cockney is a novelty... .J.M.S.: Everybody
wanted to die; everybody laughed; and the merry
murderer went gaily on to murder and laugh some
more. .. .R.L.J.: Not good enough for print....
V. : Doesn’t get exciting. .. .A.M.S.: Well enough
written, but not attractive... .Hillary F.: It doesn’t
make much of a yarn... .G.T.C.: Pity to use that
technical color on such improbable stuff... .M.C.8.:
Too slight. . . .M.J.8.: Nicely done, but it doesn’t get
to anything. .. .R.8.L.: “Daybreak” can’t quite man-
age to do it. . . .Una R.: Those extra syllables in the
line spoil a good thing. . . .5.A.8.: The ghost doesn’t
persuade us to let him walk here... .Iris N.: Not well
enough handled. . . .McJonah: “Short of Beef” is short
of the things that make a convincing yarn. .. .Allan
A.: Doesn’t strike u 5.... Con G.: The verses are
worse than those of your distinguished cousin;
and they’re pretty bad... .C.M.L.: Not enough in
it.... Suffenus: Not for this market.... F.C.M.:
Misses. .. .R.L.J.: “The Dead Mother” is rubbish...
W. : Nowhere near. .. .W.M.F.: None of them pull
through; tnere is promise. .. .H.W.P.: Detailed de-
scription of the operation you went under isn’t
of wide interest... .A.B. (East Guildford): Before
you talk of publishing your “poetical work” it
wouldn’t be a bad notion to find something to write
about. .. .J.N.D. (or some other initials, : “Don’s
Fortune” isn’t worth 2d John G.: No use..,.
E.A.H.: Blank verse of poor quality, with a rhyme
or two at the end to make it worse... .J.A.P.: None
printable J.S.R.: The . row in the church wants
brightening. .. .Onoto: It managed to get its nose
in ; but hadn’t the strength to push any farther....
M. 8.: Wordsworth might have written this (but he
didn’t) :
If the dairy herd commenced to speak
In the vicinity of our Creek,
And echoed their master’s actions bold,
To many it would a tale unfold.
“Go home, you blarsted cows,” they’d say,
“What hour is this to call us, pray ?
And don’t come again with a hurricane lamp—
This is no time to disturb our camp.”
They’d come to the yard whenever they choose,
And stampede the place till ve’d quake in our shoes,
And if we weren’t there on the tick of the minute,
They’d bellow and charge to the absolute limit,
... .Oliver B.: “One Never Knows” has a touch about
it that we have never seen before in prose or verse:
What’s this ? It’s as we meet them.
“Keeping awful dry, Mick.”
Nothing doing, dry cough, a little phlem,
Mike says ’e can’t ’e-’e feels sick.
“Yes, ’tis going ter be ’nother rotter.
You know old Bill Bags, ’e-’e says-says so;
And Humpy down our way says it gotter ;
B-because the wind b-be so strong y-you know.
Their ways parted without a smile,
Heads hung down for home;
“Maree,” “Yes, Mike.” “Ga-ga-got any oil?
Gotter roometicks in my bones.”
By gad, so ’e ’ad; down with pain;
Poor Maree rubbed and rubbed.
“W-wat’s that sound? Sounds like rain!
An-and that land’s not all grubbed.”
Rain, rain! It did, heavy and thick!
No more dry coughs, for that’ll be wet.
Mike got well quick from ’is roometicks,
All smiles now, different from the last we met.
....North Terrace: There’s good fun in it; but the
work is too rough to pass.... Stevo: Prisoner at the
bar, you are fined elevenpence for breaking every
law and bylaw of the Verse-smiths’ Union. . . .P.S.S.:
Cut out the preliminary song and dance, and get to
your sermon.. . .D.D.F.: No use to us.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W. 0.8.: Gag bad; drawing worse.... L.W.: Did
you really think that male figure would pass as
original? E.K.: Nowhere near the mark..!.
A. : Venerable joke... .R.F.R.: Hardly worth it.
. ...M.H.: No good for reproduction. .. .J. 8.: But
that horse couldn’t win a race, mainly because it
has only three legs E.C.: Hairy Legs was turned
out to grass long ago... .R.S.R.: Bad drawing....
B. : No good tackling bush subjects if you don’t
know the bush R.C.: That gag was got off by the
foreman when they were building 'the Pyramids
A.8.C.: Amateurish figures set in a nightmare per-
spective.
“Zanthus”; Years ago the N.S.W. Mines
Department stretched things a bit and pub-
lished some of the remarkably good work
of W. D. Campbell on the aboriginal carvings
of Port Jackson and Broken Bay. Campbell
has done a lot more since, but in these times
no Government department or institution
seems to have interest or enterprise enough
to find the small sum needed for out-of-
pocket expenses to enable him to continue
the work. Meanwhile, a lot of interesting
carvings are being destroyed and lost for
all time.

It keeps my hair in just the position I want, from the time I
brush it in the morning until the time I retire in the evening.
It’s Great ! Take my tip and try it to-morrow. You won’t
regret it. Make sure, old chap, you get the right kind— Viola
if your scalp is dry, and Cream should it be slightly greasy.

“Nollig” : How’s this for a sample of the
| world’s bulkiest timber? In the Waihou
| bush, Hokianga (M.L.), is a kauri whose
trunk rises 75ft. before bumping a branch,
i It is 60ft. round, and is estimated to contain
| over 195,000 super feet. The spar, as a com-
mercial proposition, is unsound, for the rea-
son that no mill has a saw large enough to
tackle it. The tree is reckoned to be 2000
years old, so that Julius Cmsar’s father might
have planted it when he was a kid.
* * * *
“Jacky Roo”: “Hobson’s Bay” (B.
7/6/’23) says the Bay liners provide a maxi-
mum of discomfort. He asserts that the
decks are washed between 8 a.m. and noon.
On the Moreton Bay the crew started scrub-
bing at 6.30 a.m., and the decks were invari-
ably clear by 8 a.m. In regard to food, the
Moreton Bay’s menu was entirely composed
of Aussie products, and excellent tucker at
that. _ I found the stewards and officers very
obliging, which is to their credit considering
the treatment they receive from the average
“choom.”
* * * *
“Cartot”: The formula for “Hellenic
as quoted by “J.8.D.” (B.
24/5/’23) might certainly produce a drink
that would be nauseous to a cultured palate,
but the chances are that it would have a
kick in it. The poppy-heads and the alcohol
would make a kind of rough tincture of
opium, with morphine and a few other potent
alkaloids for its active principles. Even a
limited quantity of the stuff, say four or
five ounces, would produce a pleasant lan-
guor, followed quickly by coma, and after
that, in default of emetics, by death. A doubt
intrudes whether the most enthusiastic
archaist would be “fain of” a second dose of
this mixture.

“T. 0.1.”; The old Pilgrim Inn, Lapstone
Hill, Blue Mountains (N.S.W.), which was
delicensed when J. O. Wascoe left it in
3.869, has been repaired, and is now occu-
pied by the owners, the Deane family. It
was the first inn on the eastern end of the
hills ; built in the early ’thirties, it became a
well-known house-of-call for coaches and
foot-passengers. It was at Wascoe’s that
Sir Frederick Pottinger accidentally wounded
himself in 1865; he died in Sydney six
weeks afterwards.
* * * #
“Cartot’’: Among Australia’s unutilised
raw materials is the seaweed which abounds
on the coasts, especially on the eastern side,
and contains a high percentage of iodine,
potassium and other mineral elements, for
which there is a constant demand. In most
other sea-girt countries the recovery of pro-
ducts from seaweed is an established in-
dustry, the process of extraction being cheap
and simple; but although Australia uses
enormous quantities of iodine and potassium
salts, both in commerce and in medicine, it
is all imported.
* * * *
“Dexite” : The police are well acquainted
with the type of crook who hangs around a
bank till he sees a juvenile messenger cash-
ing a cheque. As the- youth is leaving he
pursues him, taps him on the shoulder, tells
him there is something wrong with the signa-
ture, and having lured him back into the
bank gets the money from him and vanishes
through a side door. One of the fraternity
fell in rather badly over his “mark” in Syd-
ney the other day. He had spotted a small,
red-headed, freckle-faced youngster as his
victim ; and had apparently induced the latter
to accept him as a bank officer. But, as the
pair passed a messenger inside the entrance
on their return, the kid wheeled round with,
“Eh, mister, does this bloke belong here?”
and when the fraud made a dash to escape
he found himself tripped over a small foot.
The attempt to bolt settled his hash. Since
the yarn got round, to be small and red-
headed and freckle-faced has become a recom-
mendation for the job of office-cat.
* * * *
“P.X.” : A cable a few days ago mentioned
that, owing to a sadden drop in exchange,
it was costing Fritz half-a-day’s pay or there-
abouts to buy a loaf of bread, and two years’
wages to get a suit of clothes. Yarns of
that sort are more misleading than instruc-
tive. What really happens is that, whereas
the man who has bread or clothes to sell can
put up his prices at a moment’s notice, it
may take a week or two for a workman to
get a rise in wages. It isn’t the Fritz work-
man who is suffering most; his pay keeps
pretty close on the heels of the fluctuating
mark. The great sufferer has been and still
is the person who had provided for his old
age, or been provided by her late husband
or father, with what was thought to be a
fixed income. But for those people the fluc-
tuations have ceased to have much interest.
An income equal (pre-war) to £5OO a vear
has shrunk to less than fourpence now. The
gainers have been the people and institutions
with whom the money was invested—the
btate ; banks, mortgagors, etc. They have
practically had their debts wiped out. And
that is where the money ought to come from
to provide the reparations: it. could be raised
by new taxes (to take the place of those no
longer necessary to pay interest on State
loans), new mortgages, and new issues of
debentures.

Convenience.
Only one fire to look after. Less trouble than
the ordinary room fire, and may be left un-
attended for hours at a time.
Cleanliness.
No ashes, soot, smoke or fumes inside the
house. No soiling or discoloration of furnish-
ings.
Healthfulness.
Nothing is added to the air but warmth. No
unhealthy gases or vapors. The temperature
is like that of a bright Spring day in its fresh-
ness and comfort.
A Home Comfortably
Warmed in Every Corner.
ON the majority of Australian homes the open
fire is accepted as the only means of artificial
heat within the reach of the average house-
holder, and its disadvantages and discomforts
are looked upon as the inevitable accompaniment
of winter.
The illustration given here shows the essentials of an
IDEAL Heating
installation as applied to modern dwellings. The system consists of
a boiler and supply pipes connected to radiators in every room
where warmth is required. The temperature of any room may be
raised or lowered at will, and a genial warmth is provided right
throughout the house.
Here are four definite reasons why you should have the “Ideal”
system of Hot-water Radiation installed in your home:—
Economy.
The amount of fuel usually burnt in one open
fireplace will heat four average rooms. For
an equal heating duty, electric radiators will
cost over 26 times as much, and gas-fires
(with flue) 1 1 times as much as “Ideal” Hot-
water Heating.
Send us a rough plan of your house for an approximate
estimate of cost. We prepare Heating plans on tracings of
Architects, Builders or Plufnbers. Write NOW to

SH4L/ING
“L ramao”: There is a vague idea that
married persons live longer than single ones,
but in the last census dealing with the con-
jugal conditions of M.L.’s population two of
the three centenarians among the males are
classified as “Never married.”
“F. Clinton” : This country is desperately
short of veterinary hospitals. They need
not be elaborate affairs; and once the idea
of providing them catches on a demand for
small hospitals all over the country will
develop. Qualified vets, could erect, equip
and conduct their own little shows very
cheaply. This in turn might result in many
ot the misguided youths who now take a
medical degree qualifying for a vet.’s degree,
to their ultimate gain. At present the pro-
fession is looked down upon by the medicoes,
but there is far more scope for qualified prac-
titioners in it than in medicine.
“Compos” : Have struck some quaint shop-
signs in my wanderings about and around
Australia. Here’s one from a fried-fisli em-
porium in a Central Queensland town: “This
shop will not be open sonday. If i can’t
make leven 6 days week i go way for good.”
And I knew a pre-war German in a squally
seaport whose effort to make himself intel-
ligible was much appreciated locally. Leav-
ing the doors open meant frequently retriev-
ing the goods from the back yard; so Hans
closed the front entrance, put a weight be-
hind it and placarded the window as follows:
The door is shut, but the shop is open on
account of the vindy vedder.”
Pantagruel” : The difficulty in connection
with the commercial utilisation of the
Queensland nut (one of the best-flavored of
the nut family) lias hitherto been in the
hardness and thickness of its shell. This
seems to have now been overcome by the
+? ort rn one .' B B - Waldron, a settler on
the Tweed Iliver, who has propagated a
thm-shelled variety. The value of the nut
has been recognised by the Yanks, who cul-
tivate plantations of the trees in Florida,
heeds of the new thin-shelled variety are
being planted in the Brisbane Botanical Gar-
dens _ and in the Bribie Island nursery to
test its bearing and other qualities.
Robert Hap” : Who is looking after Bill’s
beer these days ? Two or three years ago beer
was declared a necessary commodity, and as
S I IC * if ifc isn’t—be the genuine
stun, yet I have never heard of a retailer
being called upon to hand a sample over the
counter for dissection. On the other hand,
spirits—especially rum—are subjected to
incessant and rigorous test by the official
analyst. As for wines, apparently any old
thing may be retailed. Is no one sufficiently
interested in the Australian wine business
to try to have a standard fixed? If that
was done we shouldn’t have to worry so
much about the character of the places that
sold the goods.
“Sturt”: General Birdwood is still pegging
away in India at the possibilities of Aus°-
tralian trade there. In a recent letter to
the Agent-General for South Aus. he men-
tioned that he was taking S.A. wine to his
northern command at Rawal Pindi, and had
placed orders with the Q.M.G. of the army
to l l.)0 tons of Australian jam, besides fruits,
I am satisfied,” lie adds, “that there is a
considerable market for Australian tinned
and dried fruits here. Most of it comes at
present from California. But I am afraid
nothing really big will result—unless the
large firms in Australia arrange for really
good commercial travellers to lay the excel-
lence of their fruits before the buyers in the
large towns in India, and do business direct
with them.”
• “ B [ ue - Bar ”: Sydney’s second-hand cloth-
ing shops are displaying the evidence of an-
other slip on the part of the Defence De-
partment. Some 12 months ago the senior
cadets were supplied with a quaint outfit
which became satirically known as the Phy-
sical Training issue. A khaki guernsey and
shorts and a pair of brown canvas shoes
were surmounted by a khaki rag hat that
refused to take any shape at all Most
trainees flatly refused to wear the garb and
area-officers supported them by pointing out
to H.Q. that no stockings were issued, and
therefore, the uniform was incomplete. The
stockings never materialised, and the regu
lation A.I.F. uniform now takes the plac»
of the P.T. issue. But the rag hats, neatly
ironed and with a dinky little crease down
the crown, are labelled “Latest style” in the
shop windows. -And bundles of the guern-
seys are selling at 7s. 6d. apiece.
“O. P. Hand’s” sad little vignette:—
Knights in Melbourne are becoming as common
as rabbits outback. You meet a score of them in an
afternoon’s walk through the city—and appreciate
Gilbert’s “where everybody’s somebody nobody’s any-
body.” You have no sooner passed Irvine on his way
to lunch at the Melbourne Club than you meet
McPherson, Robinson, Manifold, Mackey and Peacock
going to their pet cafes. Later, as you elb'ow through
the crowd you see Gibson, Monash, Lyle, Mitchell
Mcßeath and McCay. .“Surely no more to-dav,’’ vou
think, when suddenly the tall form of Garran looms
up, and, not for behind, Barrett. As you reach the
Town Hall corner you avoid a collision with Swan-
son, only to see approaching MacFarland, Allen and
Masson. Occasionally Taverner, Miller, Higgins, Quick
and Spencer trip along, and probably one or two
more whom you have forgotten. We have also a
trinity of baronets (not counting S’Rupert, who be-
longs more to Sydney), but we don’t hear much
about them. They aren’t wealthy—and what’s the
good of being a baronet if you’re not wealthy?
Norbell”: Authority had been pestering
my friend Poldoody for his wife’s birth cer-
tificate, or proof of baptism, or the testi-
mony of witnesses to either ceremony, but
L oldoody couldn’t oblige, as no records were
available in Maoriland, where Mrs Pol-
doody belongs. After much ink had been
shed on both sides Poldoody sent this to the
Mate Superannuation Board in Sydney:
I have written to three (3) clergymen of different
denominations at the town where my wife is supposed
to have been born, but so far no reply has been
received. As it is a matter of about half a century
since my wife was born, and as both her parents are
dead, I do not think I can obtain the information
you require.
My wife assures me that she was present at her
birth, but cannot bring the incident to mind, and is
consequently unaware of the names of 'any witnesses
thereto, excepting her mother, who she believes was
aso present. As her mother has been dead for over
30 years, she cannot be communicated with. Mv
wife at this juncture has expressed her willingness
to be re-baptised at any spot in or around Sydney
that you may select. I am personally aware that
she was born somewhere and that she is still alive.
He is awaiting the next communique.

With Night-time Dials
Some folks are light sleepers.
They wake up in the middle of
the night and wonder: "is it
time to get up ? ”
Stand a Big Ben or Baby Ben
equipped with a night-time dial
beside the bed and the question
will be answered at a glance.
The numerals and hands are
coated with a radium-luminous
compound that gives off a bright
glow in the dark and enables
one to read the time readily.
For the sound sleeper who
only wakes at the crack of the
bell, there are the regular, white
dial models.
The difference in price is in
the dials. The night-time dial
costs more and is worth it.

Backache! Why?
Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do you feel
that you are getting old? Having made up your mind that
you are a martyr, do you vent your ill-humor on the family?
After a while, the pain and stiffness leave you, and you forget
your troubles until the next morning, when the same dull pain
in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing your
nerves, brings back all the dire forebodings of the day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim, and
you are starting on a long journey towards ill-health and
infirmity. The kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleans-
ing out the impurities from your blood. Each day there is an
accumulation of waste which must upset the body. It forms
Uric Acid, and Uric Acid is the most insidious form of poison-
ing that can take place in your body. The number of ills
to which it leads is almost limitless, and though middle age is
the most favorable season for their activity, even the youngest
child often suffers, and sometimes dies from the different mani-
festations of Kidney Trouble.
A change of diet is an advisable precaution, but a reliable,
specially-prepared remedy, such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, is
the safeguard for your health.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills stimulate your sluggish kidneys to
re-action, and assist the work of removing impurities from
your blood, which the kidneys have been unable to accomplish
unassisted. Then their tonic action so revives the kidneys that
are filtering the blood that the work is done automatically as
by a perfect machine. Your back straightens up, the pulling,
dragging feeling gradually leaves you; in the morning you
can leap from bed, feeling a glow of health and vigor, and
meet life with a smiling face.
It is the duty of every man, not only to himself, but to
the world at large, to keep his health in the proper condition
for his daily task; and for the victim of Kidney Trouble Dr.
Sheldon’s Gin Pills give just the little boost his organs need
to make them his slave, instead of his being a slave to ill-health.

Songs of a Sad Country.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE NURSE'S LULLABY.
HUSH, little love, for the feet of Dusk
Stir softly through the air,
And Mary the Mother comes to set
A star within your hair.
Sleep, O heart, for the candle-light
Out of the darkness gleams,
And Mary’s mouth on your mouth shall fill
The drowsy night with dreams.
The Red Willow.
Sweet is the air where the willow binds
The stars of God in her drowning hair,
And sweet the place where the red leaves
sweep,
For Coilin Mac Dara kissed me there.
Red willow, drooping over the stream,
Is it not singing you’ll be, asthore?
But oh, it’s sad is the willow’s song,
For Coilin Mac Dara comes no more.
Whisper, small leaves and you grasses tall,
The woeful news in the ears of Day—
The willow weeps, but I_ cannot weep
For Coilin’s mouth that is turned to clay.
Hill of the Graves.
For love of me and a green land
My five strong sons went swinging
Up to the hill with the fighting people,
And they sweet singing.
Ora, I’m loving my green land
And the soul of her weening,
But the heart of me yearns for my five sons
On the hill sleeping.
The Pool of the Rushes.
Do you know where the fairies hide the gold
They steal each day from the morning’s
glow ?
Why, where could it be, O foolish one,
But down by the pool of the rushes-o !
Do you know in what mirror the maidens
gaze
On St. Brigid’s Eve that they may know
Faces of lovers who’ll hold their hearts?
Why, into the pool of the rushes-o !
Do you know where the women go to weep
Their lost love-nights and their days of
woe?
They creep to the pool their tears have made,
The deep, dark pool of the rushes-o!
Little Young Things.
Christ’s little kiss on your eyes, young things,
And the laughter of you in a sad hour
I deem more fair than my lover’s kiss,
And he with the mouth of a dark flower.
My loves you are, little soft young things,
But my grief is that to-morrow
Must set your mouths to a keening tune
And paint your eyes with the world’s
sorrow.

PAMELA TRAVERS.
E Felici Lunatici.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After two years in Macquarie-street,
Dr. Elijah Baze, brain specialist,
found that instead of being firmly
established on the road to financial security,
his bank balance registered a series of irre-
gular undulations. He calculated that only
about six months could elapse before an em-
barrassing interview with his bank manager
would be necessary, so he determined upon
one great effort to retrieve his position.
Perusing the morning’s Herald, his eye
lighted on the following advertisement: —
For sale, a large house standing in own grounds.
Twenty-six rooms. All conveniences. Suitable for
hospital. Near Sydney. Terms. 0005 this office.
Often, before the untimely demise of opti-
mism, he had pictured such a place as a side-
line—a home where wealthy patients might
endeavor to establish a balance between
money and mentality, with the aid of his
skill.
After an unnecessary examination of his
appointment-book, he set out for the rooms
of his more successful brother-specialist, Dr.
Bodley Head, whom he found in a state of
mind not too distantly removed from that
of some of the patients awaiting his atten-
tion. After some little time the irate gentle-
man calmed down sufficiently to explain the
cause of his indignation. It appeared that
it had been Dr. Head’s practice to send
such of his clients as required lengthy treat-
ment to the establishment of one Dr. Bender.
For some reason, the Bender Home had of
late been the scene of several distressing in-
cidents, and only yesterday one of Dr.
Head’s charges had been rather roughly
handled by another inmate, who labored
under the delusion that he was Satan re-
proving Sin. The trouble was that there
was no other suitable place to which hi 3
half-dozen patients could be transferred; at
least, there was not until Elijah Baze
brought forth his scheme for an establish-
ment under his own direction.
Bodley Head was delighted with the idea,
and even offered financial help, which was
gratefully accepted. Three weeks later, at
the doors of a fine old house standing in
hiah-fenced grounds, about six miles from
Sydney, Elijah Baze, M.D., received half-a-
dozen gentlemen, variously deficient, as the
nucleus of what promised to be a highly
lucrative venture.
From amongst 200 applicants he chose five
assistants, none of whom were experienced
in the work, for he wished to train them
from the beginning in his own methods.
The first was an ex-plumber, tempera-
mentally unfitted for his calling by reason
of his natural celerity. Number two had
been a gentleman of the chorus until adipose
tissue outweighed his natural charm of man-
ner. The third was blessed, or cursed, with
what appeared to be a perpetual smile, due
to some nervous affection. He had been an
undertaker prior to the seizure, but after
presiding smilingly at several funerals busi-
ness sagged, and he had reluctantly to make
way for someone of more appropriate appear-
ance. Number four had been a civil ser-
vant who found it necessary to resign owing
to repeated attacks of insomnia after lunch.
The last had been a professional medium,
but had, unfortunately, prematurely ex-
hausted his supply of Ectoplasm.
Of the patients the most important was
Thaddeus Henry, a fine figure of a man of
dignified bearing. The others were of more
or less ordinary types who might never have
found their ways to such a place had it not
been for the embarrassment which they
caused their wealthy relatives.
Elijah instructed his henchmen that they
were to endeavor to contribute as much as
possible to the amusement of the eccentric
ones until they became used to their new
surroundings. They were to humor them in
everything within reason, and to make them
as comfortable as their conditions permitted.
They proceeded to do this, each according to
his own ideas, so that when the Chorus
Gentleman was not impressing upon them
in a soulful voice that he had an almost irre-
sistible desire to go to a place called Dixie,
the Plumber was learnedly expounding upon
some one of the 17 methods of clearing a
choked drainpipe, until only a general igno-
rance of a reliable method of disposing of
choked plumbers prevented a sudden reduc-
tion in the number of the staff. The Medium
became clairvoyant at the slightest provoca-
tion, and often with none at all; while the
Undertaker would recite little anecdotes from
his collection, the gem of which was a hum-
orous monologue entitled “Rolling Down to
Rookwood on the 1.15.” The Civil Servant,
who knew sufficient about the ponies to pass
him for membership, of the Hairdressers’
Union, lacked aggressiveness; but, once
started, he had an easy style which was
luckily all his own.
Thaddeus Henry recognised, even in his
sane moments, that there were some things
about which he and the rest of the world
were not in complete agreement. At the
same time he was a humanitarian, and, though
he could stand it himself, it pained him to
see his fellow-guests surfeited with amuse-
ment. His companions were also homoe-
opathetic in their taste for vaudeville, and
all were soon in complete accordance of
opinion that the painstaking assistants were
much more worthy of treatment than their
less deficient selves.
_ After much earnest consideration they de-
cided to take over the management of the
institution: Henry to supersede Dr. Baze,
the others nobly agreeing to assume the
positions to be vacated by the assistants.
Henry, who was a master of strategy, hav-
ing arranged the details, the coup was car-
ried successfully into effect the following day.
In the morning an inspector from the
Lunacy Department arrived unexpectedly. He
was escorted to the reception-room by one
of the new warders, and was received by
Thaddeus, who informed him of the num-
ber of inmates and the nature of their obses-
sions.
“The worst case,” he said, “is a poor fel-
low who labors under the delusion that he
is the prophet Elijah; a most distressing
and violent case.”
Baze, who was not aware of his de-
position, entered the room at that moment
accompanied by two of the original patients.
He concluded on seeing the stranger that he
was a new patient who was expected that
day. Thaddeus whispered something in the
inspector’s ear as Elijah hurried forward
and shook hands cordially.
“Welcome,” he said. “You know who I
am, of course?”
“Yes,” replied the inspector. “This gentle-
man,” indicating Thaddeus, “has informed
me of your cleverness, and, indeed, I have
been familiar with your prognostications since
my earliest youth.”
Dr. Baze was puzzled for a moment until
it dawned upon him that this was part of
some delusion from which the new arrival
suffered.
“You flatter me,” he said. “I had no idea
that I was so widely known.”
“There has been a considerable slump in
the prophet business,” rejoined the inspector,
“since the establishment of weather bureaux
and the Anti-Propheteering Court. In fact,
between the biologists and company promo-
ters the industry is falling into disrepute.”
A violent ringing of the telephone bell
interrupted the conversation, and Baze hur-
ried away to answer the call. Once in the
corridor he was quickly secured and placed
in the padded cell, where he spent the rest
of the day inventing lurid and descriptive
additions to his vocabulary.
The ex-assistants were then examined, and,
being ignorant of the identity of the visitor,
they vied with each other in their efforts to
entertain. Each was then locked in his own
room, and the inspector, having lunched,
departed to report that the institution was
excellent in every respect.
Not many days of the new regime had
passed before the duties of office began
to grow irksome to the altruists. They
grumbled continually, and Henry began
to grow apprehensive for the future.
At first he was in favor of a stra-
tegic retreat to Sydney, but on reflection
it was apparent that liberty would not be
permanent. Finally, it was decided that
Thaddeus should impersonate Dr. Baze and
visit the Lunacy Department to make repre-
sentations for their release.
At 10 o’clock the following morning Thad-
deus Henry, alias Dr. Elijah Baze, en-
tered the Lunacy Department, and was
directed at the inquiry desk to the sanctum
of one of the senior officers.
“Of course, you will have to fill in form
J,” this gentleman instructed him when he
,had stated his case. “Form Jis an applica-
tion for the Forms B and Q, on which you
will make application for an appointment
with the Deputy-Sub-Vice-Under-Secretary
to the Chief Clerk, who will instruct you how
to proceed.”
Thaddeus, who had expected some delay,
was agreeably surprised. He was about to
depart after murmuring his thanks, when
he espied a card on the wall giving notice
that the Departmental Dramatic Society in-
tended to produce “Caesar” at an early date.
He was astounded that they should dare to
contemplate such a thing without his per-
mission. It was unthinkable. ITe would
have them all thrown to the lions as sure
as his name was Julius.
tie remonstrated with the senior official
to such effect that he was provided with a
conveyance painted a pleasant green which
carried him to a large building at Darling-
hurst, there to await the result of inquiries

The Daily Miracle.
TO work at high pres-
sure throughout the
day, snatch a hurried
lunch; to have enough
vigor left to enjoy a full
evening’s amusement or
recreation; to go to bed
tired, and at once to sink
into an untroubled sleep;
then to wake betimes, re-
freshed and alert, all eager
to taste the bracing joys of
another strenuous day—
that is the Daily Miracle.
And yet there’s no magic
in it. You can accomplish
it yourself with no trouble
and practically no ex-
pense. All you have to
do is to tip a “sixpence-
ful” of Kruschen Salts
into your breakfast-cup of
tea every morning.
A trick? Only if you call
Nature’s own process a
trick. For Kruschen con-
tains just the* six salts
which, as your doctor will
tell you, your body needs
for its well-being. If you
constantly lead a healthy,
outdoor life with plenty of
fresh air and exercise, a
proper diet and no wor-
ries, your system would
extract these vital salts
from your food. But
a sedentary indoor life,
errors of diet, overwork,
worry and the like, accom-
panied too frequently by
indigestion and dyspepsia,
prevent you from extract-
ing these salts from your
food. Hence that chronic
“below-par” feeling from
which so many people
suffer.
Kruschen tones up the
body’s eliminating organs
so that they do their work
regularly and effectively,
removes all the waste mat-
ter that has been clogging
the system, and sends
new, pure blood coursing
through the veins. You
feel invigorated in both
body and mind, healthier,
happier, ready for work,
ready for play.
“It’s the little daily dose
that does it.’’ Make a
habit of it, and work for
yourself the Daily Miracle,
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will
lie on a sixpence. It’s
the little daily dose
Kr^ts
Good Health for a Farthing a Day.
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
just the right amount for a most
invigorating daily tonic. The medi-
cinal dose for persons suffering from
pains of rheumatism and gout, or
habitual constipation, with inactive
liver, etc., is half to one teaspoonful
in a tumbler of hot water before
breakfast.
Every chemist sells Kruschen
Salts. A bottle contains 96 morn-
ing “pinches”—enough to last three
months. Get a bottle to-day.
NOTE. —Kruschen Salts are made in Manchester, Eng-
land, by E. Griffiths Hughes, Ltd., established 175(5,
in the reign of George the Second.

N.S. 71.
concerning a person named Cassius, who,
he felt sure, was responsible for this out-
rage.
Failing to obtain any reliable information
concerning the alleged doctor from the Baze
Institute per telephone, he was escorted
thither by two gentlemen of the police force.
They found the place in a state of chaos,
several independent republics having sprung
up in the absence of Thaddeus Henry.
Everybody claimed sanity, but none had
evidence to offer, and certainly appearances
were against all of them. The police officers,
being men of intelligence and resource, set
a general test. One of them read aloud the
first chapter of the newest book on psychology,
which all claimed to comprehend with the
exception of the real Dr. Baze. He was
immediately proclaimed sane, and the ori-
ginal order of things was restored.
The incident appears to have broken
Elijah’s nerve. He carried on the Insti-
tute for a few months, and then disappeared.
Nothing was heard of him until a fortnight
ago, when he was discovered in charge of a
small store at a place called Beri Beri in the
Northern Territory.
F. E. GHAN.
The “Sign-of-the-Cross” Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHENEVER I see an almanac pic
tore of “The Sign of the Cross,”
with Mercia’s hands clasped and
Mercia’s eyes always turned up to that acro-
batic heaven that is forever up on top of a
revolving world, I think of the Hon. Betty.
I know that I should not tell you of the
Hon. Betty, because it is' scarcely a respect-
able story, but, at the same time, I think
it should be written to serve as a dreadful
warning, even if it does bring heat to your
innocent cheeks.
We first met the Hon. Betty at a little
seaside town with a reputation sufficiently
warm to make the surrounding country blush.
It is only a intle township or about ltd houses
and a hotel, the hotel looking so large that
it reminds one of a hen with a family of
newly-hatched chickens around it. You
would wonder what kept that hotel going.
As a matter of fact, the hamlet was not re-
spectable. Anybody could see it couldn’t be
respectable with a big hotel in it like that.
How we ever came to live in such a place I
can’t tell you. It" you go after a job the
advertiser wants to see your references; yet
you will go and live in a town simply because
it looks pretty. This town was the most
innocent-looking, unsophisticated cluster of
houses the world has ever seen. It seemed
to be thinking of nothing but flowers, and
Tennyson’s poems, going to bed at 8 o’clock,
and buying daddy a sale-knitted tie for his
birthday. Actually, it smoked cigarettes,
wore the most expensive silk stockings, and
went bathing in pink stock me tte two-pieces
that looked simply like nothing at a distance.
And it spent its time tearing its character
to pieces, and playing half-crown auction
bridge, and stopping up late at night.
It took me some time to find it out. Our
first impression was that the people were
too uppish, and that we had got out of out-
class. We were treated with icy reserve. I
made attempts to get in with the fellows,
but they gave me the cold shoulder, and the
ladies also gave my wife the impression that
they thought she was beneath them. It didn’t
trouble us, because we hadn’t gone to live
in this idyllic spot to meet people. But I
4id want to know where the good fishing was.
It was the Hon. Betty who put us wise
to it. When we got to know her we dis-
covered that we were ignored and cold-
shouldered because we were too respectable.
We discovered that there were only three
/ispectable people in the place, if we didn’t
count the washerwoman, and they were my
wife, myself and the Hon. Betty. Billy,
Betty’s husband, didn’t count, because every-
body knew what he was. Everybody knew,
too, that Billy had been sent out of England
to Australia "to get rid of him, and that he
was paid £5OO a year to stay away.
But you only had to look at the Hon.
Betty to know teat she was respectable. Only
that we knew different, we would have sup-
posed that the artist w-ho drew Mercia in
that almanac I’ve mentioned had taken the
Hon. Betty for his subject. There was not
a girl in all the world who had such an
angel face. She had that white transparent
skin which only saintly people have, people
who are next door to being removed to. a
higher plane. Her mouth had red lips which
seemed formed in saying prayers, and her
eyes were large and beautifully colored, and
seemed as if she could see the angels through
the crystal portals. But although Betty was so
good and beautiful, she did not stay with
her hands clasped and her eyes always look-
ing upward. Oh, no. Betty was too good
to look good all the time. She joined in
the fun that was always going, and when-
ever the fancy-dress ball occurred at the hotel
she attended dressed in a Red Cross cos-
tume or went as a nun. Everybody adored
Betty, even the wicked people.
And much else Betty told us. Nobody was
married in the place. At least, some were
married, but they were not married to the —
oh, you know what I mean.
“That ; s why you two are disliked,” said
Betty. “They kept cool to you at first, wait-
ing to see if you were properly married, and
when they found out that you were they
began to try to shoulder you out of the
place.”
“But how did they find out we were mar-
ried? They didn’t see our marriage certi-
ficate.” I said.
Betty sniffed. “Phoo!. You can always
tell.” She thmight for a moment. “There
is a way really married people treat each
other.”
“Oh !” said my wife and myself in a breath,
proving telepathy.
Then she started to tell us- the family his-
tory of everybody in the place. That is how
we came to know that it was a village of
remittance-men. How they all came to gravi-
tate to one place was a marvel. II? made
you believe in like attracting like. But there
they wore, men who did nothing but fish and
roam about barefooted, in trousers and shirt,
all day till dinner-time, and then put on
evening-dress clothes and ate in them. Then
thev had each other in to make up a fourth at
bridge, or went up to the hotel and played
billiards or poker, and got more or less drunk
till 2 or 2 in the morning.
You never saw a village with such smart
and pretty women. They all had a way of
wearing clothes that looked theatrical rather.
And in the hundred houses of the place there
were not half-a-dozen children. Of course,
there was no school. We often used to won-
der how the few children there were got born.
They must have been an oversight.
So,. you see, Betty had time to stop
listening to the angels singing in Heaven
to notice things nearer home. While she
talked a fellow passed with fishing-gear
accompanied by a lady in silk hose which
couldn’t have cost less than two guineas, my
wife said.
“Now, they’re married all right,” I said.
“See how devoted they are.”
“He is, but she isn’t,” said Betty decor-
ously.
"JiixplainV” I asked.
“His wife left him for another man. This
one used to be in musical comedy.”
My wife and I talked the matter over, and
decided that we ought to get out of the place.
The Hon. Betty said she could quite under-
stand how we felt about it.
“I’d go,” she added, “only my husband
finds the fishing good, and he doesn't mind
people. His troubles whether they’re mar-
ried or not!”
“Aren’t you afraid that the finger of scorn
will be pointed at you?” I asked.
“It simply makes me shudder,” she said.
And she shuddered. Poor little thing !
So that is how the only three respectable
people in the place formed a bond of friend-
ship. We built up around ourselves a bul-
wark of respectability. We used to talk it
over a lot and wonder how we could do some-
thing to make things different. Betty was
whole-souled about it. It was beautiful to
see her. It made one believe in better things.
It- was nice to know that people who were
beautiful could also be good.
Now, my wife was awfully severe. Like
most respectable people she believed in the
law.
“What is wanted is a policeman,” she said.
“Oh, I’ve tried to get a policeman, but the
Government won’t give us one because we
don’t pay any dog licenses. The Government
will do simply nothing for us. We are out-
side the law here. Now and again the Gov-
ernment sends a collector along, but there’s
nothing ever doing. You see, they can’t get
anything, because these are all furnished
houses, and we could all clear out so easily.
We haven’t a post office for that reason.
We’ve got nothing. We could be murdered
in our beds, and the Government wouldn’t
do anything for us.”
It made my blood run cold to think of the
sort of place we had got into. Betty said
she would prefer living in the South Sea
Islands among cannibals.
“It wouldn’t be so bad if there was a
church,” I suggested.
Betty jumped up in excitement. “The very
thing,”' she said. “I wonder why nobody
ever thought of it before. It’s a church that’s
wanted.”
She was so filled with delight that she ran
out without saying good-bye to visit as many
houses as she could, suggesting that a church
should be established.
Now, this place was the most enthusiastic
township in the world. There never was a
place where people joined together with such
excitement in doing something or other. Some-
times it was a concert, sometimes a bridge
tournament, or a dramatic entertainment
(they had plenty first-rate talent), or
a fancy-dress ball. They were always
working together to find some way of
amusing themselves, excepting when they
were not tearing one another’s characters to
pieces. So Betty’s idea took on like wildfire,
men and women deciding that they wanted
nothing so much as they wanted a church.
A subscription was started to raise sufficient
to hire the hall once a week, and somebody
lent an organ. Everybody gave something
to the fund. Somebody gave half-a-crown.
So you see how enthusiastic they were.
Then the question arose as to what reli-
gion it was to be. This question nearly
wrecked the scheme, till the Hon. Betty de-
cided it by rolling up balls of paper and
dropping them in a hat. Every pellet con-
tained the name of a religion. Not all, only
the religions that happened to be convenient.
The Hon. Betty drew, and pulled out one—
I forget which. It really doesn’t matter.
Nobody asked us to subscribe, and the Hon.
Betty advised us to have nothing to do with
it, anyway.
We took her advice.
So it came to pass that our little town
began to have a weekly preaching of the
gospel. A young minister used to be sent,
a beautiful boy who had a face like Betty.
Billy—the Hon. Betty’s Billy—used to
take round the plate. Nobody could talk of
anything else than church all the rest of
the week; The township seemed to be get-
ting better and better every day in every
way. Weeks passed. Then the funds began
to get lower and lower. People who gave a
shilling began to put threepence in the plate,
eT'd tlv 1 rent of the hall got into arrears.
The owner threatened to stop the service.
One Sunday Billy wouldn’t leave off fishing
to come and take the plate round. The fish
were biting too well. Next day the lady
who lent the organ had it taken away, as
she was afraid it would be distrained for
rent.
All that time the two beautiful young
people, the Hon. Betty and the incipient
minister, grew closer together. It seemed
natural. Betty used to listen to his sermons
with a rapt attention that was too lovely
for words. She used to meet him at the
boat, and see him off.
Then the Hon. Betty disappeared. They
all wondered, excepting Billy, who went on
fishing. One day somebody brought him a
note. He read it calmly, tossed the note to
the other fellow j?t the boat, struck a match
and lit a cigarette, and went on fishing.
The other chap read the letter. This is
what he read :
Dear Billy,—l am not coming back to you any
more. I never did care much for you. Now I have
met somebody I love better. Hope you won’t mind.
—Betty.
“Good heavens!” cried Billy’s pal. “What
are you going to do?”
“Do?” asked the Hon. Billy with raised
eyebrows.
“Will you divorce her?”
“No need,” he said, baiting a hook. After
casting, he said: “I always wondered how
long she would stick it—what!”
