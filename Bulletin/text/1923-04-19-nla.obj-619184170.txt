The Speck’s Own
Some of the success of Captain Green’s
The Fortieth, issued from the office of
the Government Printer at Hobart, is un-
doubtedly due to the fact that the bat-
talion, as General Monash remarks, “enjoyed
the almost unique experience of retaining the
same commander and many of the same offi-
cers throughout its whole career.” Green
was one of those officers, and was “cobbers”
with every man of the unit, from his enlist-
ment as a private in Claremont Camp to his
field-won adjutantcy. Also, he took the
trouble to minutely re-examine the Somme
fighting-ground of 1918 under peace condi-
tions. These things made for accuracy and
coherency. But the chief charm of the story
is in the telling, the artistic discrimination
with which the author uses the spotlight, and
the unpretentious but sure-eyed selective
faculty displayed in grasping just the right
incidents to fling into vivid pictures against
the dull grey background of regimental com-
monplace.
The story of the third battle of Ypres,
where the fighting-men reached the lowest
possible depths of human misery, but “were
never within measurable distance of the great
objective,” though “the cost to the British
and overseas armies was 200,000 casualties”
—this story is as realistically limned in a
few paragraphs as any war-picture portrayed
in the massed colors and cumulative columns
of Emile Zola. For instance. In the after-
noon, after the disastrous attempt of the
40th and other battalions to advance through
the quagmires of the Ravebeck to I’asschen-
daele, a search party of three
went into enemy territory behind Dab Trench to
look for any wounded of Lieut. Grant’s party who
had crossed the creek to help the New Zealanders.
They went over Dab Trench, which was occupied
by the enemy, but he took no notice of them, except
to wave encouragingly for them to carry on. They
found there several New Zealanders and English and
three of our wounded. These were brought out.
As the- last man was being carried through 1 Water-
fields a wounded German followed the two runners
' allying the stretcher. As they were unable to
take him they tried to induce him to go back, but
lie was badly wounded, and only seemed to realise
that they had a stretcher, and a stretcher —-German
or other —meant help. He tried to follow them on
his hands and knees. His progress became slower
and slower till he stopped, and his head sank for-
ward and buried in the sea of mud.
A few sentences earlier in the same chapter
we get this :
,On the left the position was very bad. At day-
light the Maorilanders coming up on our
left in two magnificent waves. They were seen all
that day still in two waves, lying dead in the mud
in front of the uncut wire at Dab Trench.
In this action the Fortieth lost 79 killed, 168
wounded, and one prisoner,
And in other vein. During the disastrous
day in the mud and blood of the Ravebeck—
The company quartermaster-sergeants appeared
with a carrying party with stew in hot
boxes. It was a gallant attempt to provide a hot
meal, but owing to the incredibly slow rate of move-
ment it was only by faith that we knew it had
once been hot. Still, it cheered us as a link with
a better world.
After the Fortieth’s first week in the trenches
(December* 1916) :
We lived, slept and ate in the mud, and each day
can only be described as a day of misery and muck.
The only thing that made it tolerable was a sense
of humor that was boundless—the humor that made
one man remonstrate with another for washing his
gumboots in the water in which they had to sleep.
When the Lys rose and flooded part of the
trench:—
On an enemy aeroplane coming over, the trench-
officer ordered everybody to keep perfectly still. But
he saw one man moving, and shouted a gentle re-
proof. The offender, who was very short in the
legs, replied: “I can’t help it; I’m swimming.”
Among many strange happenings recorded
is the uprising of No. 1008, Pte. Kelty, who
was posted missing after a raid on an enemy
trench at Douve River on May 31, 1917;
During the raid Pte. Kelty jumped into the enemy
trench and proceeded to get busy with his bayonet,
when a bomb burst behind him. He felt a blow
on the head at the same time, and lost interest in
the proceedings. Some time about midday he woke
up and took stock of his position. He was' severely
wounded, his arms and equipment had been taken,
and he had apparently been left for dead by the
enemy. The trench where he was lying was badly
damaged, and was being bombarded by our medium
trench mortars. He seemed unable to move to get
away from the bombardment, and decided that he
must remain there, when a trench-mortar shell burst
near him, and he again lost consciousness. At this
moment a trench-mortar officer and an officer of the
39th Battalion, who were watching the shoot from
our front line, saw the body of a man blown into
the air by a burst and fall into No Man’s Land.
They thought it must be one of the enemy, and
drew the attention of several others to the incident.
As they were looking at the body it was seen to
move, stand up and stagger towards our line. It
was then seen that he was an Australian. After
going about 20 yards he collapsed, and an officer of
the 39th jumped over the parapet, ran into No Man’s
Land, picked him up and carried him in Pte
Kelty was found to be severely wounded in several
places, but gave a coherent account of what had
happened. He recovered from his wounds and re-
joined the battalion, but was wounded again at Mor-
lancourt on March 28, 1918, and lost a leg. He
was sent to Australia, but the hospital ship was
torpedoed and sunk. He was rescued from the wreck
and finally reached Tasmania.
Dealing with the English war correspondents
and their assertions that the soldiers were
always eager to get into battle:—
It is a fundamental principle of the code of “din-
kum blokes” to stick to friends and go through
hell with them if they have to go; so to stay out of
a fight of your own free will is to forfeit self-
respect,. But to say that men are anxious to get
into the horrors of a battle for sheer pleasure is an
insult to the intelligence of an outsider, and not
exactly complimentary to the soldier who knows
what it means....A man who says he went into
battle with a light heart is either a liar or a mental
pervert.
The Fortieth’s most exciting days in France
were the four at the end of August, 1918,
near Clery, closing the famous 10 days’ drive
of the 3rd and 4th armies which swept Fritz’s
35 divisions from one side of the old Somme
battlefield to the other. The two chapters in
which Green describes the fighting of these
four days are perhaps the most thrilling in
the whole narrative. During the last two
days of the period the Fortieth’s four com-
panies were reduced to three, and four pla-
toons to two, but with what the Commander-
in-Chief called “relentlessness” and Frank
Green calls “colossal impudence,” kept
advancing against fresh troops, and reached
its objective—the Bouehavesnes-road.
Besides a dozen fine maps and appendices
of statistics (two V.C.’s are listed among
the decorations) The Fortieth sports an
“Apologia” and an “Epilogue.” The first
explains the rather belated appearance of
this interesting narrative by the fact that
the author (who before and after the war
was Clerk Assistant in Tas. Assembly, and
is now on the staff of the Federal Parlia-
ment) left the State in May, 1921. Unex-
pected difficulties then arose in connection
with maps and the official checking of appen-
dices—difficulties which could only be solved
by long-distance and necessarily protracted
methods. The “Epilogue” (a masterpiece of
humorous narrative in its way) is an account
of the final washing-up of the Fortieth’s
affairs in France in May, 1919. That wash-
ing-up (especially of the French villagers’
astounding claims for compensation for one
thing and another) seems to have been a
thoroughly Australian function. Major Gib-
lin (now Tas. State Statistician) was offi-
cial liquidator of the battalion’s estate.
JOHN DRAYMAN.
How Love Evolved
According to The Evolution of Love, by
Emil Lucka (Alien and Unwin), there was
no such thing in the ancient world —nothin*
but sexual desire—though both Hector anc
Penelope might have had something to say
about that. The Romans, of course, were
a cruel and materialistic people, much as
the Germans have shown themselves to be,
and one does not suspect them of high ideals.
But this German-Austrian poet, Lucka,
boldly asserts that the Greeks were equally
unidealistic, though they produced Plato, to
whom the “idea” was everything, and who
actually divided “love” into a higher and
lower type, whence arose our modern myth
that he advocated sexless love between man
and woman. Many have uttered this libel
on the Greeks, and Lucka gets over the diffi-
culty of Plato’s own words by saying that
he was a lonely forerunner of Christianity—•
which would have probably much astonished
Plato. But certainly the Greeks took to
homo-sexuality, ancL Lucka ponderously ex-
plains why. The Greek man, like most
modern men, discovered that, after all, women
could give him very little that was worth
while, if he did not want an heir. The
French, a very wise people who, like the
Greeks, see facts as they are, have crystal-
lised this into epigrams, such as “All women
are much the same when the candle is put
out.” If a Greek had to fight, his woman-
friend would probably run away; but a man
might possibly stand bravely by his side and
fight it out. And if he wanted a sensible
companion, undoubtedly he was more likely
to find it in a man than in a woman. Even
if he wanted beauty, as a Greek generally
did, then the kalokagathos, the good and
beautiful, was quite as likely to be found in
a young man as in a young woman—as most
people have thought while gazing on our
young Australians on the beaches any after-
noon. Because of this love of beauty and
superiority of the male for a workaday com-
panion, the Greeks encouraged these homo-
sexual unions, which now seem so repul-
sive ; and the Theban Sacred Band and the
Spartan soldiery fought most nobly until
the Romans showed the world how fighting
really ought to be done if distractions were
not allowed to weaken an army. Even in
art the Greeks seem to have thought that
a kind of middle sex was more truly beauti-
ful than either extreme, devising the herma-
phrodite figure, which you could not call
either man or woman, but still Was extra-
ordinarily beautiful.
Then came Christianity, when a woman
was intex-posed as an intermediary between
God and man ; and, perhaps still more im-
portant, its “faith,” which has been irrever-
ently defined as the “faculty of believing
what you know to be untrue.” It was in
the south of France, in Provence, that
modern love was evolved. The bold bad
baron in whiskers and armor went a-roving
in search of combat with some equally hid-
eous male person, while his poor little wife,
probably screwed up in her iron “virtue-
protector,” looked hopelessly out through the
grille of her prison at the gay troubadour
with his lute and his parti-colored raiment,
and desired him. She firmly believed that
at any moment he might arise through the
floor in the guise of a little blue bird and
kiss her. Every woman in Provence believed
this nonsense, just as firmly as she believed
many things equally incredible ; and the trou-
badour, believing what woman told him—
just as men do to this day—sang her long-
ings in music more thrilling than was ever
sting before. Thus arose modern love, with
its idealism of the unattainable, its worship
of the faraway beloved. It was. I think,
probably the woman who first thought of love
in its modern sense; it was probably the man
who first sang its ecstasy. Nowadays the
ladies seem to be excelling the men in rap-
ture.
Next came the Italian Renaissance, when
the world once more became happy after the
long misery of the Middle Ages, and, still
under the influence of paganism, the great
artists once more turned to the hermaphro-
dite for true beauty—this according to
Lucka. Except, he says, for the wonderful
“David,” you can hardly tell whether Michel-
angelo’s statues are men or women—a state-
ment that one takes leave to doubt; observe
their noble musculature.! On the other hand,
Bellini’s and Raphael’s Madonnas are un-
doubtedly, female. Their beauty is that of
a sweet and wistful woman, not of a man.
Lucka must have forgotten Bellini. Perhaps
awkward memories of Venice haunted his
Austrian mind.
After Provence Lucka gets into meta-
physics, and is hard to follow. He devotes
many pages to Goethe and Wagner and the
“love-death” of Tristan and Isolde. I sup-
pose he knows what he means himself. He
also talks about how “pragmatism”—the
philosophy of William James—has driven
out “monism”—the philosophy of Haeckel—
though he tries to reconcile Haeckel’s theo-
ries with the supposed development of the
sexual instinct in young people and their
elders. It would need a good many pages
to put it into intelligible language, and, any-
how. I don’t agree with him, for the monism
of Haeckel is still probably nearer the truth
than the dreams of much-advertised “poet-
philosophers” like Lucka. But one must

apologise for one’s mere scientific mind, which
believes in things that can be proved, rather
than in transcendental metaphysics.
Ihe truest thing in the book is probably
the sentence: ".She 1 modern woman] is
hardly conscious of the chasm between sexual
desire and personal love.” That is, and
always has been, woman’s character, and
accounts for much marital unhappiness, and
probably for woman’s saintly nature as com-
pared with man’s; also, for most of the mis-
understandings that arise between the sexes.

Novels for Men
Most fiction, nowadays, is written for
women. It lias been calculated tfiat they
torm <5 per cent, of the reading public, as
tar as novels are concerned. liven the small
percentage of men who read can hardly be
said to be guided by definite masculine tastes.
Most ot them skim through books with their
wives or daughters, taking the purely femi-
nine appeal of a novel for granted. These
men cannot be counted in with the mascu-
line public, for their wants are too undefined
to have any force. What remains ? A
handful, mainly writers, who care passion-
ately for literature and have exact and jealous
ideas about its scope.
T>ut they are too few to ensure the popu-
larity of any writer for men. They can
only guarantee him a limited following that
will make up by its devotion for the thinness
ot its ranks. Some vantage-points are
possessed by them. The literary reviews
are largely controlled by men, and this ex-
plains why the names of some writers who
eke out a scanty living by their books, helped
by public grants, are known all over the
English-speaking world. W. H. Hudson was
such a writer. His “Purple Land” is one
of the most distinguished romantic novels in
the language, but he forgot to take the
feminine point-of-view into account, and so
he suffered in popularity. Not till his old
age, when he wrote about birds, was he able
to make a living at literature.
The people who pay the piper call the
tune, and so the fiction of to-day has a
strong feminine note. Glance at the short
stories in the popular magazines. They are
not held together by the narrative faculty,
that, vital flow which is the life-blood of
good fiction, but by vibrations on the taut-
ened string of sentimental love. That is
their whole motive and subject-matter. No
matter what minor variations their plot may
have, you can be sure of the finale. “Their
met, and the whole world was blotted
out ....But most of the world was blotted
out long before.
The novel, on the other hand, is written
for women of maturer years; at least, when
it is written by people of talent. Young
love is therefore confined to the first part
of the book, and the remainder treats of a
more sophisticated variety. There are the
exasperations of domestic life, or the nervous
rackings and heart-burnings that accompany
adventures pursued outside the fence. But
the general appeal is the same. Somewhere
m the background thrums the tom-tom of
strained sentiment. The world presented is
the _ one that appears to women —micro-
scopic, intense and rather suffocating in its
atmosphere.
Who are the writers that may be classed
as masculine, then? The word itself is
rather misleading, for it has been so exclu-
sively applied to red-blooded fiction of the
Kipling and Jack London school. And the
hankering after red blood and violence is
not essentially a masculine quality. There
is not much of it, for instance, in Conrad
(a typical writer for men), in Cunning-
hame Graham, Hardy, George Moore or W.
H. Hudson.
But I am reminded that Conrad is now a
popular writer, and that women devour his
books. The change came about with the
publication of “Chance.” I very well re-
member the day this novel was published in
London. Until then Conrad had been an
unpopular writer, living mainly on a public
grant; but “Chance” happened to have a
more pronounced love-interest than the
earlier novels, and, besides, was sprinkled
with epigrams about women. There you
have it! Next to a sentimental love-interest
there is nothing women like better than epi-
grams about themselves. An astute pub-
lisher saw his chance and distributed them
through the press with the judgment of a
bird-trapper sprinkling his seed. Columns
of lyrical reviews could not have worked the
oracle so well. From that day Conrad has
been in demand at the circulating libraries,
and old books of his have been reprinted. It
may be just accident that his later books pay
more attention to romantic heroines than
the earlier ones did, but one can’t help won-
dering. Samson had his locks shorn, and
it is unlikely that Conrad will ever write
another “Nigger of the Narcissus.”
Sincerity is the touchstone of literature
and no man can accept the woman’s point-of-
view and remain quite sincere. He lives in
a world of slightly different values. Why
should he renounce it when he sits down to
write? There are plenty of women who can
supply the quite justifiable demand for a pic-
ture of the world seen through the eyes of their
sex. Let them do it and reap the profit
but let them keep their own virtue. It is not
a question of subject-matter so much as of
emphasis and atmosphere. “Tom Jones”
could be re-written by Compton Mackenzie in
a way that would make it a hot favorite at
the lending libraries; but who reads Field-
ing nowadays? Perhaps he is coarse. The
masculine instinct is for passion instead of
sentiment, for coarseness instead of eroti-
cism, and there is a long literary tradition
to back it up. But the handling of the
love-interest is not the only difference
between the sexes. There are other matters
in life. A man wants vivid character, robust
humor, a tough philosophy, and tragedy with-
out a superfluity of tears. The atmosphere
of women’s novels is not good for him: it is
warm and enervating, like a small room
heated with an asbestos stove.
And so I look forward to the day when a
masculine public will be created that will
allow the novel to regain its proper scope
There is already a widespread feeling against
men serving in shops that deal exclusively
in feminine things. Why should not such a
feeling extend? It is surely a less venial
matter to traffic in clothes than in emotions
and spiritual values. Perhaps in the future
such men as want to write feminine novels
for the sake of profit will be forced to adopt
names like Martha or Phyllis, as women once
used the name of George.
In Australia w T e have not been so badly off
until now. The patrons of lending libraries
do not read Australian fiction, as a rule, and
so there has been no temptation to cater for
them. What small public our writers have
had has been largely composed of men. “Rob-
bery Under Arms’’ is a novel for men: so is
Bedford’s “True Eyes and the Whirlwind,”
in spite of its name. As for our writers of
short stories, from Lawson down to William
Blocksidge (who published “An Anzac Mus-
ter” from some obscure press the other day),
they have mainly written for papers read by
men, and so have preserved their integrity.
May they long be sheltered from that
feminine public that would destroy them !
VANCE PALMER.
Shakspeare and Shylock
To a recent discussion David McKee
Wright introduced taunts with regard to
the alleged meanness and grasping character
of Shakspeare. The apparent intention was
to suggest that if Shakspeare prosecuted a
petty debt he must lack rhe generosity and
ideality necessary for the man who wrote
the plays. At this date it is impossible to
ascertain with what motive Shakspeare
pressed for the payment in question, but in
the general attitude of mind revealed by Mr.
Wright we can see one of the widest and
most annoying misunderstandings as to the
creative nature. The profound intellect
never seeks to find in external affa.rs the
gesture of dignity from which, mentally, he
never unbends. It is only the small man
that finds liis dignity involved in the ex-
teriors of life; for, since he lives entirely on
the surface, once he loses touch with' the
surface mechanism of his humanity he has
nothing to hold on to. Beethoven could
throw eggs at his housekeeper and remain
the most terrific figure of nobility that has
ever been on earth; Macaulay must per-
petually keep a drawing-room criterion of
manners and actions before him, or he would
crumple up into a very trivial person. The
Macaulays can never understand how
Beethoven could do such a thing; to them
it reveals an uncouth and unrefined element.
Yet it is obvious to anyone that if refine-
ment means sensibility to subtleties of emo-
tion and beauty, then Macaulay is to
Bethoven what a Hottentot would be to
Macaulay.
It was not a century after Shakspeare
that Pope, who had, of course, no means of
guessing the mental exaltation that is the
creative stimulus, and which flames through
Shakspeare’s work from the first to the last
page, wrote the famous lines:—
For gain, not glory, winged his roving flight;
And grew immortal in his own despite.
Shakspeare was a good business man: he
probably ran the theatre excellently; he
probably made every penny out of it that he
could, and used any means or any person
he could find in order to do so. He wanted
freedom; moreover, the strong mind will
tackle life at any point where in the striie
and clash of affairs it may strengthen the
muscles of the will. For this gain in will-
power is reflected in the added power of
mental construction that can be brought to
bear in the development of a large emotional
theme.
How many of the real creative minds
have brought on themselves this stigma of
hardness in money matters! Read Byron’s
letters to Murray and see how he defies the
small people’s psychology of generous values
by demanding that he be called a Jew.
Read the hundreds of stories about Turner
and agents who, after doing their best to
keep him down, expected him to make their
fortunes by selling to them cheaply. Yet
these were two of the most generous men
that ever lived. It is forgotten how
Turner bought back his pictures to present
them to the nation and left a very large
sum for poor artists, which bequest the
lawyers managed to quash. Read Beet-
hoven’s letters to his Edinburgh publisher;
look at the whole splendid career of Wagner,
taking money where he wanted it In a
fashion thht still raises cries of rage from
all his conventional biographers. But
Wagner knew that the prodigal gift of
Beauty he had to give man outweighed all
the gold in the world, and he accordingly,
without any false shame, took as much of it
as he could get.
Poets, of course, should keep starving in
garrets and refusing contamination with
the vile world in order that they may glad-
den the hearts and stir the compassion of
future generations with their “vulgar desire
for generous emotion.” The really fine mind
disdains this vulgar desire: it is generous:
it does not need to take the postures and
attitudes of generosity. It will generally
expressly refuse them and often go to an
extreme in repudiation of all the people
consider noble. The minor poet or artist
who is only the reflection in the people of
the higher mind shares the people’s need of
external props, and will express their exas-
peration at all that possesses wings. The
high mind carries his own criterion; his
d’gnity is involved in the sincerity with
which he faces himself, not with attitudes.
And while he seeks self-realisation frankly
and passionately, he will not worry how his
antics may appear to the myopia of present
or future commentators. He has other
things to think of.
Tennyson, having no dignity as a self-
revealer, has all the people’s conception of
dignity. He is a vaporish abstraction, a
harmonious nonentity limned in all the
popular terms of virtue and greatness. So
even if he had given as much away to the poor
as Byron he could not have achieved any
more virtue than is to be found in a copy-
book. The high mind may disdain conven-
tional values by retiring into the proud and
kingly court of a Rubens, or the squalid
Ghetto of a Rembrandt; but however he
expresses disdain, he will certainly express
it.
JACK LINDSAY.
A Great Critic
George Jean Nathan, whose The World
m Falseface has just been published by
Alfred Knopf (New York), was described
by A. B. Walkley as “the equal of any
living dramatic critic.” There are ways in
which he is the superior of any—even of
Mr. Walkley himself. He loves the modern
theatre, and he despises it —two essentials,
as Shaw, and after him Max Beerbolim,
proved in the Saturday Review, for a just
appreciation of 99 per cent, of the plays
now being written in English. And Nathan
has a third quality. How many successful
men or women in any country, much less in
that home of the herd-mind, America, would
have had the courage to put their names to
this?
The great problems of the world—social, political,
economic and theological—do not concern me in
the slightest. I care not who writes the laws of
a country so that I may listen to its songs.... I
was born in America, and America is to me, at
the time of writing, the most comfortable country
to live in. That is why I am here and not in
France, or in England, or elsewhere. But if Eng-
land became more comfortable than America to-
morrow I’d live in England. And if 1 lived in Eng-
land I should be no more interested in the important
problems of England than I am now interested in
the important problems of America. My sole
interest lies in writing, and I can write as well
in one place as in another, whether it be Barcelona,
Spain, or Coon Rapids, 10wa.... I do not care a
tinker’s dam whether Germany invades Belgium or
Belgium Germany, whether Ireland is free or not
free, whether the Stock Exchange is bombed or not
bombed.... On that day during the World War when
the most critical battle was being fought I sat in
my still, sunlit library composing a chapter on
.■esthetics for a new book on the drama. And at 6
o’clock, my day’s work done, I shook and drank
half-a-dozen excellent aperitifs.
Wickedly anti-social, of course—but, then, a
dramatic critic is rather hampered than
otherwise by being what the Yankees call
“a regular fellow.” Unimaginativeness
raised to the nth degree—but, then, imagina-
tion is not half so desirable in a critic as the
will to tell the truth.
Four-fifths of Nathan’s readers are likely
to be shocked at his cynicism, including the
war-profiteers, who showed by their deeds
that they felt as he did but would have
sacrificed an army-contract rather than
admit it. He may have meant them to be
shocked, for it is one of his weaknesses that
he likes to shock people. But the great
point is that what he said was true, for
these are things that no man is capable of
inventing about himself. He is able to take
this monstrously aloof attitude towards the
hopes and fears, the joys and miseries, of
the nations, and concentrate on his art, be-
cause he is a Jew and an international.
Many people call themselves internationals
—about 40 per cent, of the German nation
is said to have been internationalist in theory
until the war came and slew the unnatural
doctrine in a night—but it takes a Jew to
carry conviction when he denies his native
land. The concentration which Nathan
brings to his job is an asset; and a man
who looks with his clear-eyed detachment at
the mumming which plays such a big part
in the business of patriotism is not likely
to be deceived by stage tricks of acting or
heroics. Throw in a clear nervous style and
a keen sense of humor, and you get an
almost perfect instrument for the purposes
of modern dramatic criticism.
Much of the matter in “The World in
Falseface” is fugitive stuff which has
already appeared in the magazine which he
edits with H. L. Mencken. The book is
worth while chiefly for the light which it
casts on a remarkable personality.
JOHN D.
A Satchel of Books
Silent Highways of the Jungle (Chapman and
Dodd) is the record of a trip across Peru to the
Amazon made by G. M. Dyott, F.R.G.S., at the
instigation of the Peruvian president, to look into
the feasibility of aerial transport to the remote but
rich parts of the republic to which railways won’t
penetrate for years. The author conveys some inter-
esting impressions of the wild country he traversed
and of the natives he met, but he lacks the art of
selection and overloads his story with commonplace
incidents of travel.
The Adventures of a Tropical Tramp, by Harry L.
Foster (The Bodley Head). After sampling a mining
camp in the Andes, this brisk writer started copy-
hunting for a Peruvian paper, with intervals of
diplomatic work, and his wanderings took him over,
to and down the Amazon. A good journalistic touch
enables him to happily mix entertainment with infor-
mation, and a very readable book is the result.
Foster’s summing up is: “South America is a land
of opportunity; but its opportunities are either for
the very big corporation or the very big man.”
The London Spy, by Thomas Burke (Thornton
Butterworth). Burke’s description of odd corners of
the great metropolis is one of his best things. He
writes jauntily and sadly, cynically and philosophi-
cally, seeing cruel everyday affairs turned into
romances by unexpected flashes of tenderness and
pity. He talks more freely of Canning Town, Step-
ney, Spitalfields, and other dismal places than, of
Kensington and Park-lane, and contrasts the free,
unconscious beauty of East, End children with the
pallid youngsters of the rich, finding much in the
comparison for sardonic speculation. He mentions,
too, how he took Charlie Chaplin for a nocturnal
ramble and discovered that the comedian was lonelier
than any royal being.
The - ■ dstraKan Piano Tutor, by E. A. Dobbie,
L.R.A.M. (Paling and Co.). An admirable work,
carried out on an excellent plan. The five-finger
exercise in the ordinary “Tutor” employs only the
notes CDEFG ; in this new one the five notes rising
from the keynote are used ; then the five notes
descending from the keynote. Crochets, quavers,
etc., are used, making it a comprehensive exercise
in keeping time as well as training the fingers.
And this exercise is given in every key. But this
is only one of a 'score of good features. The solfa
names are written above the notes, to prepare for
singing at sight. A number of simple dance pieces
are given, one in each key : with the chords in the
left hand, so that the pupil may get a good sense of
time and rhythm. Also several operatic excerpts
have been included ; set out as in the original form,
but fingered carefully. Altogether the “Australian
Tutor” should assist in turning out more sight-
readers every year, and prove specially valuable to
those pupils who have not made good on their first
essay, but are eager to make a, fresh start on a more
intelligent plan.

Alexander DowSe, Adelaide boot merchant and
afterwards preacher and prophet, is heard of unex-
pectedly in James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” the huge mass
of Rabelaisian realism and blasphemy which is
mildly agitating Western Europe. Most of the
critics attribute the> discourse given in full to Billy
Sunday; but “Elijah's” name is there all right,
though Dowie never, really talked like this: —
“Come on, you wine-fizzling, gin-sizzling, boose-
guzzling existences! Come on, you dog-gone, bull-
necked, beetle-browed, hog-jowled, peanut-brained,
weasel-eyed four-flushers, false alarms and excess bag-
gage! Come on, you triple extract of infamy.
Alexander J. Christ Dowie, that’s yanked to glory
’most half this planet”....

Saving the Lost Power
in Transmission.
If you paid for the power actually delivered to
your machines, instead of the power generated,
you would be amazed at the reduction in your
power bill and other upkeep costs.
This energy lost between the motor and the
driven machine is largely absorbed by plain
lineshaft bearings. Every bearing of the
ordinary sleeve type develops a certain amount
of friction and often causes trouble even when
properly lubricated and running under the
most favorable conditions.
When lubrication is faulty, however, due to
the entrance of dust or dirt, or when binding
strains are set up through shaft deflection, the
losses from these factors increase out of all
proportion to the power delivered.

Blocks the shaft rides almost frictionless, not

only when weil aligned, but under conditions
of misalignment. The inner race tilts with the
shaft like a ball-and-socket joint, and the bear-
ing cannot bind, heat, stick or run hot.
SKF Hangers and Plummer Blocks reduce this
power loss approximately 60 per cent., thereby
releasing 15 to 35 per cent, of the generated
power for productive work. In nearly seven
thousand plants the world over this fact has
been conclusively demonstrated and proved.

That Elusive Something.
By “PHLOX.”
YOUR husband is flirting with a prettj
dark woman.”
“The wretch!”
“He’s asking her to take afternoon tea
with him,” went on the fortune-teller,
nothing abashed by her client’s interjection.
“Where are they going for tea?”
“I can’t tell you that, but at present
they’re dancing.”
“Is my husband dancing?”
“He is.”
“Oh, dear, what would you advise me to
do?”
“I did not undertake to advise you,
madam, but to tell your fortune. Half-a-
crown, please!”
Mrs. Marsden left the fortune-teller with
rage in her heart and revenge in her soul.
Who was this woman, she asked herself, who
was usurping her husband’s affections? That
explained his attitude towards her lately.
He had begun to criticise her, and pass un-
complimentary remarks about her figure and
her complexion.
Indeed, be had hinted that she was passe.
Why, there was her husband and the
woman walking towards her. John has
recognised me, she thought; now I wonder
what he’ll have to say for himself. That
fortune-teller is certainly a clever woman.
“How fortunate we met you, Mary. This
is Miss Heath—our supervisor of agencies,
who has done such good business for our
publications. We were just going to have
a cup of tea while we talk over business
matters, and it will be nice for you to come,
too.”
Mrs. Marsden gave Miss Heath a formal
bow, and a cold, “How do you do?” When
her husband said they would go to the Went-
worth for tea, she was more than ever con-
vinced that the fortune-teller was a witch.
The trio sat down at a table, and before long
Mrs. Marsden, succumbing to the charm of
Miss Heath, almost forgot her annoyance
and jealousy. Her husband merely talked
business with Miss Heath, who from time
to time politely referred to Mrs. Marsden
for approval of plans she promulgated. And
when Mr. Marsden said that he would be
working back at the office that night, and
suggested that Miss Heath spend the even-
ing with Mrs. Marsden and regale her with
the latest Paris fashions, she was quite
agreeable.
Miss Heath, the daughter of an Anglican
clergyman, was born and bred in Paris, and
having just come from the gay city, was able
to give Mrs. Marsden interesting fashion
notes.
Before long, however, the eternal feminine
asserted itself, and Mrs. Marsden wondered
why Miss Heath, with her charm and beauty,
had never married. She told Mrs. Marsden
that the only man she ever loved was killed
on active service.
Prom this they talked of rejuvenescence,
the subject ever uppermost in the mind of
the woman who has passed her first youth.
“If only I could reduce myself,” sighed
Mrs. Marsden.
“You can, easily.”
“Oh, of course, the French know the secret
of remaining beautiful, practically for ever.”
“What I take to keep my figure slim is no
secret, Mrs. Marsden.”
“My deal’, I shouldn’t have thought you
needed to take anything ”
“Indeed, I do; or I would soon fall into
flesh. Directly I find myself putting on
weight, I just get a package of clynol berries,
and take one after each meal.”
“Do they affect the heart?”
“Oh, dear, no; the most delicate person
can take them with safety.”
“I shall certainly take them, and I won-
der, Miss Heath, if you know of a good face
cream that doesn’t grow hairs.”
“Indeed, I do; and I’m most grateful to
the manufacturers for what it has done for
me. I never use anything but mereolized
wax. It is similar to the preparation used
by the famous French beauty Ninon
D’Enclos, who at sixty had the complexion
of a child.”
“How very fortunate I met you, Miss
Heath; I shall certainly add mereolized wax
to the list of things I want from the chemist.
Do you know I’m rather distressed about
my hair; it’s greying fast, and my husband
suggests that I dye it, but I hate the very
thought of dye.”
“I can assure you, Mrs. Marsden, there’s
no necessity to use dye. When I lost my
fiance my hair began greying fast, but I used
Tammalite, and now you won’t find a grey
hair in my head —it simply worked wonders.
It’s quite simple to use. You just get two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite, and mix
it with three ounces of may rum. Apply to
the scalp at night with a small sponge until
the hair has gone back to its original color.”
“Thank you very much for the informa-
tion. May I ask what soap you use, Miss
Heath?”
“Certainly, I never use anything but
Filenta.”
“It’s awfully good of you, to be at such
pains to tell me about these delightful pre-
parations.”
“Not at all; I think it’s a woman’s duty
to contribute to the beauty of the world,
and if you will notice, a woman who takes
pains with herself has that elusive some-
thing that is so fascinating. But it’s time
I was going.”
“I will send you home in the car. You
have given me fresh courage in life. I’m
now bent on cultivating that elusive some-
thing.”

Is It Fair to the Wife?
S a business man you make use of mechanical
and electrical devices that save time, obtain
maximum efficiency and reduce labor to a
minimum. But how about your wife? Is
she using up-to-date machinery in her home
that saves her trouble and lightens her work? Or is she
still struggling with broom and wash tub?
Washing dishes! Have you ever tried it? Then you
know how monotonous and tiresome it must be to the
wife day after day. A Dish-washing Machine does it
automatically, better, quicker. Just place the dirty dishes
in the container, and the machine in motion—that is the
process.
Same thing with clothes. You place them in the Delco
Light Washer; start the machine and forget it. The
clothes are washed perfectly clean in a very short time,
and are taken out and passed through the electrically-
driven wringer, which is part of the machine. They are
then hung on th® line, practically dry.
Have these and the many other labor-saving
devices —electric-irons, vacuum-cleaners, etc.,
explained to you. Learn how easily you can
procure them for your wife. See about it
to-day.

Wealth.
I am rich beyond compare.
Life has showered gifts on me:
Vagrant heart that rone shall snare
In the net of sophistry;
Dancing feet that feel the call
Of the lilting Pipes of Pan
( Tis but vagrants they enthrall),
Par and far from haunts of man.
Laughter is my golden friend.
Sweetest gift life gave to me;
I shall wear it to the end,
Like a flower unceasingly.

Futility.
Oh, life, dear life so short! Aghast and wan,
My soul has cried against the niggard days.
t What use at all to tread life’s lovely maze,
W hen soon the dark falls where the sun has
shone!
Only a breath—and then the passing on!
A space to hymn the green world’s wonder-
ways !
Oh, singer, blinded by the Spring’s clear
blaze,
A voice one moment lifted up—then gone!
Met, hark to this. When I have said good-
bye
Unto the warm brown earth I loved so
well,
If one should see blown grass and summer
sky,
And, breathing Beauty’s breath, remember
me,
Then, though I lay deep down in darkest
Hell,
I should forget life’s bleak futility !

Ihe sight of a blue hill lifts me again
From some despondency of mortal thought
Unto a height far higher than that sought
By the blue hill whose lift is all in vain.
Olimpses of seas show me a wider plain
lhan ever seas can know whose tides are
brought
To narrow shores where prisoned waves
are caught.
I have, unchained, my limitless free brain.
I plunge to depths that oceans ne’er shall
hold.
I dare a darkness where no Night dare
sup.
And when Death comes with double pangs
of doubt
I shall defeat his silence icy-c01d....
I know there are blue hilltops higher up.

Surely it seems some lost sweet yearning
Echoes again when the sea-winds sway.

Morns that were like a rosy favor,

Swept by the hail of the Arctic blast,
Drifting alone on seas forsaken,
Canvas tattered and reeling mast?
Long blue days with a light wind drifting
Mellow beaches where white foam curls,
Magnolia scents, warm spices drifting,
Brown thatched houses and brown-limbed

Amethyst nights that followed after.
A sultan’s lamp, the moon of gold,
Passionate voices and angry laughter,
Dawn like a grey sword, sharp and cold?

Bearing her secret of strange lost daring,
She stands alone in the sheltered street

Sanctuary.
I have hid my heart away in a safe place
j n a v , ( niet place where the winds are
still;
And only the larks sing in the blue space
That stretches infinitely above the hill.
The cocksfoot does not stir, and the rye-
grass
Sleeps as the palace slept in the fairy
tale;
Over the hill no shadows of cloud pass,
And the very songs of the locusts faint
and fail.
Only the larks sing, for my tired heart
Has never a lay to trill nor a lilt to
croon:
Safely ’tis hid awhile, till the salt smart
Is soothed away, and joy comes back with
a tune.
And what so quick to heal as the warm sun
The sane peace of the earth and the
friendly sky?
Courage, my coward heart! For the sands
run,
And there’ll be songs for your singing by

BUYING A MOTOR-CAR.
A common feature of every Insolvency Court
is the debtor whose wife insisted on having
a motor-car. In the rare cases where the
Registrar is told all, he learns that the lady
put forward a multitude of vehement argu-
ments to show that the family needed a car,
at any price, on the highest ethical grounds.
A car would enable the children to go to
Sunday-school, and the family to church, in
all weathers. And the moral aspect aside,
it was really an economy. It would pay for
its keep in saved taxi-hire and carriers’
charges. Several of the neighbors had cars
—enormous ones. Of course it would not
be necessary to begin on the grand scale:
there were cars so economical as to be within
the reach of persons of moderate means
Why be frightened? The buying of a car
was the most ordinary transaction. Every-
body was doing it. After a prolonged edu-
cational course on such lines the insolvent
one day arrived home with a vehicle
which, though a humbler affair than that
of any of the neighbors, was still in-
dubitably a car. And so bankruptcy.
When a man already owes more than he has
any immediate prospect of being able to pay
there is nothing so likely to overthrow his
tottering fortunes as the sudden acquisition
of a dirt-cheap motor-car. And it increases
the bitterness of his financial defeat when he
discovers, as he usually does, that his spouse’s
high-flown propaganda work was largely in-
sincere—that she really wanted the car, not
for church-going purposes, but to exasperate
some detested acquaintance.
A deputation of Good Templars inter-
viewed the N. S. Wales Minister for Justice
last week with a demand for a Prohibition
referendum at any price, and on their own
terms. Now, whenever an Australian pro-
hibitionist talks prohibition he drags in the
U.S.A., as though the extravagances of the
greatest creditor nation in the world’s his-
tory had any bearing on the policy of a
numerically small debtor country. Our rich
neighbors have had their Rolls-Royce, in the
form of the 18th Amendment of the Consti-
tution, for several years. That the upkeep
expenses are beginning to apnal even them
was shown pretty conclusively by the results
of the elections last November. The Re-
publican cause was dealt a stunning blow
and the Wets won 150 seats, not because the
electors favor drink, but because, as business
men, they are horrified at the insane cost
involved in the attempt to enforce drink-pro-
hibition. During last year, according to a
recent New York cable, the Treasury De-
partment paid out 15,450,000 dollars in sal-
aries to enforcement officials alone, while
44 per cent, of the business of the Federal
District Attorneys all over the U.S. con-
sisted in chamber and court work in connec-
ts tr^a^s °f liquor offenders. The
18th Amendment has literally spawned new
laws, and hence new crimes, and hence new
departments. It is an offence punishable
by imprisonment to brew or possess medi-
cinal beer—-a bucolic tonic about as harmful
as ginger-ale. In lowa the illicit distiller
whose brew goes wrong may be charged with
manslaughter, while in Oklahoma the offence
is murder. In the struggle to keep over-
seas liquor out the Government has invited
expensive trade reprisals from all those Euro-
pean countries with wine, spirits or beer to
sell,_ and it is destroying its mercantile
marine. It was decided at the end of last
year that ships flying the Stars and Stripes
could not have alcohol aboard in a U.S. port
or in a foreign one either. A few days ago
a Washington message stated that “United
States ships sold to foreigners must not
carry liquor even after the port of registry
has been transferred.” And a later cable
remarked:—
The Washington correspondent of the New York
Times says it. is understood that the Federal pro-
hibition commissioner, Mr. R. A. Haynes, faced with
the virtually impossible task of enforcing’ prohibi-
tion, will ask President Harding to authorise him to
use the naval forces to combat the activities of the
rum-smuggling fleet plying on the Atlantic coast. He
will also ask for the aid of various Governmental
departments, notably the immigration service.
America may be able to afford these splen-
didly lavish gestures, though some of the
nation s best financial minds say it cannot,
and are beginning to urge that the 18th
amendment, like several of its predecessors
(notably the 15th), shall be allowed to lapse.
Rut it is unlikely that Australia will be in a
position to afford an experiment of the sort
inside the next 50 years; and it is certain
teat no one State could make the adventure
and escape ruin
*** * '
The cool suggestion made by the N. S.
H ales Good Templars to Minister for Jus-
tice Ley was that he, the man who was re-
sponsible for putting the compensation pro-
vision into the Act, should take it out and
submit the liquor referendum to the electors
freed of this wicked proposal to sprag the
onward march of wise reform.” The argu-
ment that compensation is wicked is based
on the convenient theory that a liquor license
is not property. Mr. Ley, who as a lawyer
has had a good.deal to do with transferring
the leases of big hotels, and as a Minister
knows the revenue the Stamps Commissioner
draws from ad valorem duties on sales of
goodwill, found himself unable to subscribe
to such a view. “If you believe in prohi-
bition,” he said in effect, “you must be
prepared to ask N. S. Wales to pay a first
charge of 12J millions sterling for it. Any-
thing different is Bolshevism.” What he
might have added is that, even if his Gov-
ernment was willing to violate an Act of
Parliament and treat the liquor trade as
Lenin did the Russian middle classes, yet
still the attempt to enforce prohibition in
N. S. Wales must either destroy the State
or make a laughing-stock of its lav/s. The
mean States of America before the country
was stampeded into prohibition in the
absence of a couple of millions of its best
young men, were the prohibition States. No
one wanted to go to them, and many wanted
to get out of them. Human nature is un-
fortunately built that way: if given the
choice it tends to go rather where it can be
happy than where it can be good. If N. S.
Wales is persuaded to go dry, leaving the
rest of Australia wet, the history of States
like Maine —poor and under-populated to-
day, after 75 years of attempted prohibition
—will be repeated in its case. That is to
say, if any serious attempt is made to enforce
the law. A tremendous volume of N. S.
Wales’s trade is sea-borne, and it has the
beginnings of a great mercantile marine.
Either the example of the U.S. will have to
be followed, and all ships carrying liquor
barred from N. S. Wales ports, or the Gov-
ernment of the day will be required to admit
that it lacks the courage of its convictions,
and to submit to the knowledge that, even if
alcohol is not being brewed within the con-
fines of N. S. Wales, it is being imported
from abroad, and from other States. Syd-
ney derives a large revenue from its posi-
tion as Australia’s leading pleasure-resort.
A prohibition pleasure-resort is a contradic-
tion in terms; and part of the price the city
(and through the city the State) will have
to pay for the Yankee policy will be the
handing-over of most of its tourist business
to opposition capitals. But, after all, the
most ruinous expense, as in the U.S., will
consist in supporting one army of officials
charged with the hopeless task of ensuring
that liquor is not brought over the borders
or made inside them, and another army for
the purpose of trying offenders against a
law that no country has yet been induced
to take seriously, and guarding them in pri-
sons, when convicted. If N. S. Wales owed
nothing; if it had just struck oil or a great
gold-mine; if it had about 5,000,000 inhabi-
tants distributed more or less evenly over its
surface, it might safely decide to give the
unproven American experiment a 10-years’
trial. Its present position is that of a Goo-
feanng man with £5OO a year and a mort-
gaged home who meditates buying a Rolls
Royce limousine in order to madden the
atheistic brewer in the mansion on the
corner.
IN THE SACRED NAME OF LIBERTY.
Three varieties of law have been identified
at different times —good fixed law, bad fixed
law and the unfixed law which the local
despot, whatever his title, makes as he gees
along. For civilised purposes that last is
no law at all. A fair amount of prosperity
has been achieved under a bad system, pro-
vided it teas a system, but not under the
haphazard disorder of events where any-
thing may be a virtue to-day and a crime
to-morrow, according to the biliousness of
the dictator, or his need of money, or any
other passing influence. Would-be despots
run in all shapes. The royal Stuarts, who
never met with a real Parliament till they
moved to England, and never learned the
meaning of it, believed in keeping the Legis-
lature shut as much as possible, while tliey
spent the public revenue at discretion. The
plain Dooley kept the N. S. Wales Legis-
lature shut some 10 months out of 12, and
spent public money to keep the Broken Hill
strike going without troubling about legal
authority either. The Stuart acted on the
divine right of kings, while the Dooley
based his case on the divine sovereignty of
the people, and the results were much the
same. The ideal of every Stuart and
Dooley is the autocrat who can off-handedly
make a fresh statute and a batch of fresh
crimes, such as lese-majeste, or profiteering
or land monopoly, and date the new offence
back 10 years, and set his agents collecting
the penalties with compound interest right
off. Therefore, the worst “extremists” or
apostles of liberty that Australia possesses
look on Soviet Russia as a blessed example.
There the ruling gang appointed itself to
supreme office in 1917, and has re-elected
itself to supreme office ever since. It found
the National Parliament not to its liking,
so that body was chased off the premises and
replaced by one nominally elected by the
unlettered classes only; but even the un-
lettered classes have so little say that most
of the government that is heard of is by
“decree”- —the old ukase. In that happy
land a crime was devised the other day,
though the name of it is not given, to fit
the case of the highest local dignitary of
the Roman Catholic Church, who seems to
have earned his death-sentence and that of
a number of inferior clergy through a cer-
tain reluctance to part with the trust funds
for the purposes of compulsory militarism
and such like. The case had a sort of
counterpart in the last days of Robespierre’s
Reign of Terror. Then one accusation read:
Anne Therese Raffe, widow Coquet, denounced
by the citizen Folatre, to whom she had wished to
give a note of 50 livres which he did not need.
Her death followed promptly. Stiff, it was
hoped that the world and the Cause of
Liberty had improved in their sense of
humor since Robespierre’s day. Under the
dictatorship there has been a vast robbing
and slaying of the Orthodox Catholic clergy,
but they were at least Russian subjects, and
the church was native. The sentence passed
on foreign clergy representing an exotic
church goes to show that “Liberty” is a
cosmopolitan animal.
* * * *
The Communist variety differs from the
plain political form of upheaval inasmuch
as it aims at the destruction of religion and
civilisation. The wild-beast Commune of
Paris in 1871 was of that variety—the one
which butchered such bishops and other
clergy as it could capture, and was inter-
rupted while making a stupendous bonfire
of the beauty metropolis of Europe. All
the usual earmarks appeared again in the
abortive fuss of mad and mostly foreign
nuisances at Johannesburg, and in the doings
of Bela Iyun and Co. in Hungary—not that
Hungary has any remarkable quantity of
civilisation to lose. In Russia Communism
has produced loss of territory, depopulation,
starvation, valueless paper money, the dis-
franchisement and almost the outlawry of
the better educated classes, government by
“decree,” compulsory military service on an
unprecedented scale, compulsory labor, the
practical extinction of the more skilled and
profitable forms of industry, and a sort of
dragnet form of justice, which, as in the
case of the Parisian widow who lost her
head for offering citizen Folatre “20 livres
which he did not need,” can be made to fit
any case. And compulsory atheism is fore-
shadowed. This is the brand that is pro-
posed for Australia. The N. S. Wales Labor
Council is “affiliated” with Moscow, and
“extremists” go to the bloodstained and semi-
Asiatic city for instructions; and as stiff
another Labor Conference has declared the
“Red” programme to be the “objective,”
there is not the least doubt that the “Reds”
rule Australian Labor —in theory, at all
events.
* * * *
What would have chanced to the world
if the Communists had pushed on and com-
pleted the capture of Italy, and if Bol-
shevism had thus emerged from its semi-
barbarous hole, as the Huns did of old, and
moved 1000 miles further west, and planted
itself on the wreckage of an ancient church
and a grand old civilisation, and if there had
been two Russias with the prospect of more
at an early date, it is not pleasant to think.
Mesopotamia, which was once a better place
than Italy, has never recovered from a similar
visitation, and neither Italy nor Europe
might have recovered either. The Commu-
nists had hung out their ugly banner and
established their Provisional Government in
two thousand municipalities. The “tak-
ing over of the means of production, distri-
bution and exchange” was proceeding as
freely over a great part of the peninsula as
it did in Russia. The paralysed Ministry
did nothing. At Moscow the conquest of
Italy was regarded as practically complete,
and the uprooting of the tough old Power
that dwells in the Vatican was looked on
as assured. It almost seemed as if Trotsky,
the Jew, might become a Pope. The saving
of the situation has at least one lesson for
us. The Communistic outbreak was the
work of a comparative few, which goes to
show that the blessing of self-government,
if left lying about loose and unprotected, is
a slippery and fleeting possession. Revolu-
tions, unless directed against a foreign
oppressor, are generally the work of very
few. The great original French Revolution
is said to have had the real" support of 5
per cent, of the inhabitants. Even when it
was well under -way a real king would have
put it down with one hand and the country’s
general approval, but Louis XVI. was a
pacifist and non-resister, who left Luckner’s
faithful and reliable army loafing on the

THANKSGIVING.
Yesterday was the day that takes the shine
out of Christmas as a holiday in the U.S.A.
It was the old European “Harvest Home”:
Singing songs <rf “Hey down Derry,”
Drinking ale as brown as a berry;
To make good cheer
We’U drink good beer,
And keep up the Harvest Home.
Sundry Elizabethan allusions to wenches
complete that song, the Saturnalia of the
English hind.
“Thanksgiving” is the commemoration of
the first New England harvest and the Bar-
tholomew’s Day of turkey. It perpetuates the
first harvest in the new land of the followers
of the persecuted religions of the old. These
people loved religious liberty so much that
in the new land they kept it for themselves,
and were as bitter as any Spanish Inquisi-
tion to any outside the sects —as the wowser
has been in all ages and all lands. No man
had vote or standing except those of the sect
self-selected to rule a continent. The bitter-
ness of old New England government
America knows to-day, and the revolts there-
of ; and we know them in Australia, too
The ex-Kaiser is as good a realisation of
the super-wowser as any—to be so right in
oneself that law is nothing, because one
possesses the only true God, who frowns
on other’s virtues and prefers our vices.
“Thanksgiving” to me meant that friends
left for the country to eat turkey, and I
ate mine in New York. Thanksgiving is
turkey, and not much more than that. The
Harvest Home is far off, because food is
not grown in New York, and the middleman
eats eight ounces of each pound before it
comes to table. For a week past an aviator
has been writing advertising signs on the
New York sky in smoke-letters a mile high;
and a popular cartoon represents one of these
smoke-signs as: “Turkey 70 cents a pound.”
This nearly hit the fact. To keep the price
near 60 tents (2s. 6d.) the pound, cartloads
of cold-storage birds were side-tracked in
New Jersey for a week. An old nigger who
leads along Eleventh-street a melancholy
horse drawing a vegetable-cart in the last
stages of dissolution, told me the day before
Thanksgiving that “tuckey is 50 cents on
the hoof,” but swore further that he would
have his “tuckey” if he had to sell his
“hawse,” “bekase Than’sgivin’ ’thout no
tuckey ain’t Than’sgivin’.”
The nigger is a big child, often malevolent,
caring less than nothing for the Pilgrim
Fathers and knowing just as much of Har-
vest Home, unless it be the Saturday Har-
vest Home with the wages. He decides,
therefore, that tangible details are greater
than the immaterial abstract. And tangible
details boil down to turkey. At a nigger
Thanksgiving dinner yesterday a little
and previously-inoffensive nigger drew his
gun and shot his host and a brunette guest
because the “tuckey” was goose. Other
guests joined issue, and the total of killed
and wounded was three. But in this case
(as in so many other cases) the trouble was
not the mere difference of turkey and goose;
there was bad liquor in it, too.
Liquor—everywhere liquor, and most of it
bad. Talking on Thanksgiving Day to one
of the saloon-keepers I know, he mentioned
the necessity for a new footrail, the original
brass being worn through. Recent election
results, the fact of two bills to repeal the
State Prohibition Act, and the Governor’s
proposition for a State referendum on liquor
are new proofs that the Federal Govern-
ment self-confessedly cannot make prohibi-
tion prohibit. The State of New York spends
annually a million dollars on prohibition
police, while the State crime-returns double.
The State Government is now out to save
that million dollars and the expense of its
crime-increase by abolishing State prohibi-
tion, leaving to the Federal Government the
regeneration of the world. The “drys” are
crying that at least the saloon shall never
come back; and it needn’t, because it never
went away. Before prohibition there were
7000 saloons in New York City; now there
are probably 70,000 places that sell liquor.
The right to home-brew means the chance
to sell. In many of these mountainous
houses, with 30 or so tenants, 15 of the 30
not only make but sell. Last week a maker
in a fairly big way was “tipped off” (in the
local language) that a raid would be made
on his building next day. He promptly dis-
mantled his still and stowed it in the base-
ment until the raid should be over. Above
this floor an Irish lady was surprised while
bottling. She had only a “pony” stiff, and
she rushed it down the fire-escape. Seeing
a prohibition officer ascending the escape
she entered the window of the big manufac-
turer, and hid the still in his bath-tub. Of
course, as he was a friend of the raiders,_ his
story was believed, and the lady-distiller
was' run to earth. She refused to pay a
hundred dollars for indemnity, and was
arrested; but she need fear nothing, as Judges
all over the country have declared their in-
tention to dismiss any charges in which
there is a ghost of a doubt, one Judge going
so far as to say that the people are against
prohibition, and that he will not convict
under a law so opposed to good sense.
On Thanksgiving the liquor flowed as
freely as on election-day; and, as the
Mayoress of New York said to the Queen of
the Belgians, “Queen, that’s saying a mouth-
ful.” There were great crowds in that mar-
vellous madness of lights which is Broad-
way, and many of them were crammed to
the gills. A friend and I ate Thanksgiving
“tuckey” at a glittering restaurant in Forty-
second-street —shaded lights, bad statues and
crazy band. I have never otherwhere known
good food treated as badly as that orchestra
treated that menu: noises of the jungles,
banishment of music and the damnable caba-
ret turns which prostituted the theatre for
years, and from which it is slowly escaping.
The jazz is 50 per cent, sex, or, rather, sex-
hypocrisy. In its furtive physical contacts,
in its imitations of motions frankly lyrical
and pretending to tremendous seriousness,
it reminds me of the mixed games of a Sun-
day-school picnic. I remember at the Sun-


day-school picnics of my youth the serious
men who officiated in all the cuddling sports.
There was one with oakum whiskers and
the southerly elevation of a German cargo-
ship. The joy of the ransomed was his
when he played at “twos and threes,” him-
self the meat of the sandwich, with a girl
playing bread before him and one playing
bread abaft; and when the saint felt that
the audience became critical, he called off
the game long enough to sing a hymn. Con-
fidence —and then back to “kiss in the ring.”
The jungle music and the motions of the
alleged dance had their effect; decent people
left their tables at any point of the meal
to join in, sometimes chewing the bread of
Minnesota while smelling at the fleshpots of
Egypt! I have seen this jazzing a hundred
times, and unless it has its one meaning it
is meaningless. In New Guinea the bucks
and the girls dance for weeks —with inter-
vals and interludes —until the food-store is
exhausted, and in that you have something
honest, definite and human. But in this
gang of moneyed people, stripped to the fourth
knob on the spine, there is no dancing—only
insinuation and withdrawal, backing and fill-
ing, posing and tantalisation, to the weird
sounds of monkeys learning the xylophone.
Whoever named it “Jazz” knew his job.
From the theatre arrived a number of
noisy people showing—nearly everything.
They were comparatively decent, because the
dinner cost only three dollars, and indecency
costs up to 1.6; but they were as dull as
indecency ever was. So we left, and butted
into a Salvation Army band, with a very
big, fat man p'aying a cornet, and a very
small, thin youth playing the trombone. Our
hick was out; so back to one of the saloons
which will never return, because they never
went away.
Thanksgiving killed five and injured 22
in automobile accidents in New York, and
a restaurant in 42nd-street was broken up
by a tableful of diners who resented the loud
reading of Bibles by three evangelists. Four
men went to hospital. Otherwise, we had a
perfect day for “tuckey at 50 cents on de
hoof.”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Some Consequences of Theodore.
Queensland has been spending so much
time studying “class consciousness,” and the
“objective,” and the remedy for “wage-slav-
ery,” and the evils of “capitalism,” and the
“socialisation” of this and the other thing
that it hasn’t had time to realise exactly
what has been happening to it. Certainly
its factory-workers can’t have known what
was happening to them. Theodore has been
in office and in receipt of salary for eight
years for the express purpose of improving
their conditions; yet these official figures,
taken from the latest “Quarterly Summary
of Australian Statistics,” show that factory-
workers are far better off where there is no
Theodore :

“Profit and Sundries” is a comprehensive
item, for it covers wages of working part-
ners, rent, taxes, insurance, commission, in-
terest, discount, power, light, water, sta-
tionery, stamps, travelling expenses, freight,
repairs, purchase of new plant, depreciation
of old plant, advertising, bad debts and pro-
fits. Still one State should be at no special
disadvantage, and the item must be taken
as it stands. So the position is this: —
Queensland, being supremely blessed with both coal
and water power, has the lowest fuel bill. It is
also endowed with a Government which brays with a
billion-ass-power about its care for the workers.
Yet the Queensland factoi’y-worker gets the poorest
share of all the State workers out of the gross'out-
put of factory industry.
South Australia is the least fortunate of the States
as regards coal and water power, so its fuel bill is
far the heaviest. Also it has a plain sort of Govern-
ment, without a penn’orth of pose about being the
special friend of the horny-handed son of toil.
Yet the S. Australian worker gets the biggest “cut”
out of the gross takings, save that of the Westralian
alone, and he is almost exactly the same amount
above the average as Theodore’s Queenslander is
below it.
When it is added that, in the last year for
which complete figures are available (1921),
the Queensland worker ranked a poor fourth
among the wage-earners of the six States,
the land of brassy “saviours of the down-
trodden masses” assumes an aspect that
passes the ridiculous. These are the figures:
Year’s Average Pay per Employee.
Tasmania.. £l5O 17 3 | S. Australia. 1 . £166 19 3
Victoria . . 159 8 3 1 Westralia . • 173 12 0
Queensland 161 2 5 ] X. S. Wales 182 7 9
Another aspect of the industrial question is
“Value added in Process of Manufacture.”
The buying price of the raw materials is so
much. The selling price of the finished goods
is so much. The difference, which is neces-
sarily a very big difference, has to cover
w-ages, fuel and some thousands of other
charges, large and small. The matter in
which Labor workers are mostly interested,
however, is: “What share does the artisan
get out of the fund which represents, the
difference between the raw material and the
completed article?” The ordinary Labor
politician doesn’t require to worry, he being
an aloof creature w’ho has long lost connec-
tion with any factory paysheet; but to the
practical toiler, as distinguished from the
theoretical one, the matter has a profound
interest. So these figures call for more than
passing attention, especially when the
“Friends of the People” are clamoring for a
new lease of salary :
The Employees’ Share of Each £lOO of Added
Value.

Tasmania . . 50 14 7 | Westralia . . 60 4 7
Victoria . . 52 12 10 | South Australia 60 19 2
So in the matter of securing for the w’orker
a share of the product, Queensland, the
richest of the six States, makes the worst
showing, and South Aus., the poorest of the
lot, makes the best. Queensland has had
many rousing experiences during its eight
years of Theodoreism. It had the Towns-
ville “Red” insurrection ; the Mount Morgan
strike; the“darg,” or whatever it might be
Called, which stopped the copper industry;
the great rage of Theodore when London
people refused to trust the Government with
another £9,000,000; the Yankee loan, and
Paul Freeman. But of genuine prosperity
it has had none, and during Theodore’s time
it isn’t likely to have any.
The Sick Mind.
A note on an important movement:—
The announcement of the establishment of a Psychi-
atric clinic at Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,' and
the appointment of the new Professor of Psychiatry,
Sir John Macpherson, to take charge of it, marks,
if not the passing of an old, at any rate the rise
of a newer, order.
Mankind has suffered through the ages from many
maladies, and will no doubt continue to suffer;
but few of his maladies have been so prejudici-
ally influenced by superstition as those we ambigu-
ously designate as mental. For countless ages they
were regarded as supernatural visitations; at the
present day, when people profess to disbelieve in the
supernatural, they are still looked upon as some-
thing to be ashamed of and if possible concealed.
It is no doubt true that the occurrence of insanity
in a member of a family may be more calamitous
than death itself, but this pain or sorrow is unneces-
sarily intensified by an unreasoning fear of something
obscure or intangible, and an unreasoning shame of.
reflected social degradation. It is this emotional
barrier which is responsible for the pathetic conceal-
ment of mental maladies, and which prevents people
from seeking advice for early nervous symptoms
with the same readiness as they would consult a
physician for rheumatism or an oculist for failing
eyesight. It is possible any advice might fail to
benefit them, but the mere fact of voluntarily asking
it would mark an advance in the spiritual freedom
ot man from an obsessing superstition.
In contra-distinction to other forms of disease
there are obstacles in the way of obtaining advice and
treatment in the early stages of functional nervous
and mental affections, unless the sufferers are possessed
of plenty of money. Psychiatric clinics aim at re-
moving this inequality'. Once established they should
also be instrumental in suggesting to the public mind
the fact, long ineffectually preached by Science, that
mental diseases are physical diseases. For if a
general hospital opens its doors for this treatment,
the plain inference is that they must be, after all, but
as other diseases.
No less important than the educative and philan-
thropic functions of psychiatric clinics is the oppor-
tunity they afford to the medical students of study?
ing functional nervous diseases side by' side with other
forms of disease. The present divorce of psychiatry
from general medicine—largely due to the causes
mentioned —is detrimental both to the psychiatrist
and to the general practitioner. The doctor who wishes
to specialise in mental diseases must perforce enter
the public service as medical officer to a mental
hospital, where he finds himself an “alienist” in
more senses than one. He becomes over-specialised,
for he is too often separated not only from the
trend of general medicine, but, what is w'orse, from
a study of that large mass of functional nervous
disease which never reaches mental hospitals. The
medical practitioner frequently unfamiliar with mental
affections is in no better plight. He fails to recog-
nise the mental side of the physical ailments of , his
patients, and the minor nervous maladies in his
practice he is apt to misinterpret. When an acute
functional nervous malady forces itself upon his
attention, his natural desire must be to be relieved
of its responsibility, for which few should blame
him.
Never before has attention been so focussed upon
psychiatry'. Thanks to the teaching of Freud and
Jung, and the consequent resuscitation of the contri-
butions of the French schools of Paris and Nancy,
of whom Janet and Bernheim are the more, pro-
minent representatives, the importance of the subject
in every branch of life has been revealed to the
thinking public. But without the medical lessons
taught during and after the Great War, the teaching
would have fallen upon deaf ears. As it is now,
psychiatry can no longer be ignored. It was, curi-
ously enough, from the medical investigation of the
abnormal that the new psychology has developed,
and it is in this department that much still remains
to be done. By patient, humble observation, with-
out striving after brilliant results, this w'ork, now
for the first time introduced into Australia, should
in time effect its purpose.
It is a revolution in embryo only, and those who
expect immediate and drastic results from it will
be disappointed. It will not prevent people from be-
coming insane, even hopelessly so, or remove the
necessity for mental hospitals, any more than medical
science can prevent disease or death. If it succeeds
in relieving anxiety' and suffering which might or
might not end in insanity, and if it broadens the
education of the public and the medical profession, it
will have done as much as the present state of medi-
cal science justifies it in attempting to do.
•
The Cost of Wetting the Baby’s Head.
It is getting on for 11 years since the Com-
monwealth Parliament, in a burst of benevo-
lence, guaranteed to pay five pounds “to
every woman who gives birth to a child,
either in Australia or on board a ship pro-
ceeding from one Australian port to another,”
provided that the lady is not an Asiatic or
an aboriginal, and that the infant .is born
alive “or is a viable child.” The measure
was described by its opponents as a nefarious
bid for female votes at the election then im-
pending; by its supporters as a noble effort
to prop up the declining birth-rate. How it
has operated in the latter respect the follow-
ing table shows:—
Amount Crude
Total Claims Paid. Birth
Births. Paid. £ Rite.
1913.. 135,711 82,475 412,375 28.25

1922.. 137,496 138,140 690,700 24.76
It is true that the financial year closes on
June 30 and the statistical year on Decem-
ber 31. hut the variations thereby caused are
immaterial. The essential fact is that the
maternity bonus has grotesquely failed to
fulfil the main purpose professed by those
who rushed it into existence before t*he 1913
election. Fewer babies arrived last year
than in 1914, when (taking the population
on January 1 in each year) there were
638,000 fewer people. Roughly, £7OO 000
per annum is spent in subsidising a birth-
rate that is 3 per 1000 lower than when
there was no subsidy. Allowing for colored
infants and multiple births (the bonus is the
same whether the mother bears one child or
three) there is practically no difference be-
tween the annual total of infants and the
number of claims paid. This shows that the
bonus has been thrown away on scores of
thousands of people in the condition known
as comfortably off. In effect, it is too much
(five pounds too much) for the lady who
doesn’t need it, and too little for the mother
on whom bringing a child into the world is
a real financial burden. Reckoning in the
cost of administration, the expenditure on
this crude political bribe aggregates just on
millions. Had the money been wisely ex-
pended on subsidising lying-in hospitals and
bush-n’ursing schemes it would have sufficed
for the maternity expenses of every Austra-
lian woman in struggling circumstances. As
it is, the business of paying a fiver to every
good, bad or indifferent female who is con-
fined of a good, bad or indifferent child has
become a hideous jest.
The Commonwealth Cine.
As an Australian master-mariner sees it:—
The Commonwealth steamers are not paying despite
that they get the carriage of mails at a rate higher
than that allowed to other mail-carrying lines. And
now that foreign competition is again on the market
the excuse that the existence of the line prevents
Inchcape from bleediftg us through excessive freights
cannot be justified.
Apart from the question of Government control it
is difficult to see how the line can compete with
ships under English or foreign articles for the fol-
lowing reasons, inter alia'—
(1) The Commonwealth Navigation Act (which, by
the way, is not recognised in English waters, the
Board of Trade regarding the Merchant Shipping Act
as applicable to all -British ships), is a big handicap
to work under. For instance, a Bay liner must have
four officers, including the master, four certificated
engineers and six junior engineers on board before
proceeding to sea, whereas a similar-sized English
ship ,is deemed to be properly officered with two
officers and two certificated engineers.
(2) By far the biggest factor is the question of
wages. Compare a Bay liner with a White Star
liner of similar size. The wages bill for the former
amounts to £3lOO per month, and for the latter to
£lB5O per month, a difference of £1250, or £15,000
per annum.
(3) Overtime on English vessels is negligible.
Under the Australian award each seaman is allowed
four hours’ holiday per week or overtime at the rate
of 2s. 9d. per hour. Double pay is also allowed for
public holidays. In addition, when a seaman has
been six months on a Bay liner he is entitled to
seven days’ holiday on full pay. Altogether overtime
costs at least £3500 a year more on a Bay liner
than on an English vessel.
(4) As regards victualling, English ships work on
the Board of Trade scale, which means about £ 1
per week per man. There is no scale applicable to
Australian vessels, and the weekly cost is about
£1 10s. per man. This means a difference of about
£3500 per year.
(5) The Bay liners are aIT driven by oil, which is
more expensive than coal. A coal-driven ship of
the Bay size consumes, roughly, 120 tons of coal per
diem, and, taking the average price of coal through-
out the world as £1 ss. per ton, this means £l5O.
A Bay liner consumes, roughly, 80 tons of oil per
diem at £3 10s. per ton, which gives £2BO. The
difference is therefore £l3O per day, or £lOO after
deducting £3O for the saving in labor. The differ-
ence fe in. the vicinity of £30,000 for a year’s sail-
ing time of, say, 300 days.
(6) In addition there are dozens of petty pin-
pricks which are a continual source of expense to
the line. For example, stewards and cooks under
Australian articles who are landed sick in England
must be returned to Australia on full pay. By the
English law if a seaman is landed sick in Australia
he is returned home as a d.b.s. (distressed British
seaman), his wages ceasing from the day of landing.
At a conservative estimate, and without taking
into consideration interest on the capital cost and
depreciation, a Bay steamer costs £60,000 a year
more to run than a ship of like size under British
articles. In view of the foregoing facts, and having
regard to the “striking” propensities of the line’s
seamen, how is it possible for the Commonwealth
boats to be a commercial success? The plain fact
is that we have gone into competition with the
world in almost the only commercial line where it is
not possible to give ourselves Protection. If the
enterprise succeeds it is a triumph for Freetrade,
and our protective duties are proven unnecessary.
Decline and Fall of the Word
“Republicanism.”
“The Minister of Education said on Saturday that
in the public schools republican ideas must not be
taught to scholars, and there must be no teachers
holding republican views.”— Sydney papers.
Twenty years ago, and 20 years isn’t long,
such a pronouncement would have suggested
that that Minister had wandered back into
George 111. times, or, at least, was a rein
carnation of those high-dried aristocrats who
ascribed the alleged ruin of England to the
fact that Lord Decimus Barnacle and
Tudor Stiltstalking had failed to “boldly
muzzle the press.” To-day it is far easier
to forgive the good man his outburst. What
used to be republicanism, and what still is
the article where the boll-weevil hasn’t goc
into the word and turned it into corruption,
is a thing from which the loud, aggressive
“republican” of to-day, with Russia as his
model, would flee with shrieks of horror.
Under a plain old republic, the local Hughes
or Dooley or Bruce-Page would be chosen
by the people—a constituency too large to
be very successfully manipulated. He would
be fixed for a term of years. Caucus couldn’t
shift him any more than it could dig up
the Tasman Sea. McGjrr couldn’t rise
against him, or at least he couldn’t
rise sufficiently to make the head man even
dimly aware that he was being risen against.
He might think he heard a sound in the dis-
tance, but ho would probably set it down to
grasshoppers. The A.L.P. executive might
summon him, or censure him, or expel him,
just as an ant might push an Alp, and he
wouldn’t even know there was an executive.
According to some models. Ministers would
be appointed by the elected head, and chosen
solely from men outside the Legislature.
Therefore, Bailey and Baddeley, instead of
browbeating and dominating them at all times
and seasons, would be lucky to catch an occa-
sional glimpse of them through a window.
The familiar old way, via leagues and selec-
tion committees, might still lead to places
in the Legislature, but it would no more
lead to Ministerial office than to a seat in
the Trinity. Doubtless, there are a few
genuine republicans in Australia, and there
should be more, but it is a stern ideal to
live up to. No Minister in his senses would
object to it, and no enthusiast in his senses
would have any immediate hope of realising
it. But the creation which holds power in
the name of republicanism in Russia, and
which persons with no productive means of
support seek to teach and establish here
(for they all take Russia as their model,
and some of them make pilgrimages to that
holy land), is no more the real republican-
ism than a gorilla is a cow. First the
strongest, brightest and most enterprising or
most fortunate “crook” seizes power, aided
by a group of friends. It doesn’t require
many friends, provided the Government is
as futile as that of Louis XVI., or of Nitti
or ot Kerensky. Cranks, criminals, luna-
tics, degenerates and the “push” generally
enlist as a covering force—more especially
the push, which visualises life for the future
as one long and legalised Surry Hills riot
or I itzroy feud. According to the leader’s
own story, it is necessary for them to seize
power in Qrder that they may “confer free-
dom on the people.” The franchise is
granted even if tbjs people have it already,
either granted to the whole community or,
as in Russia, to the least educated and in-
tellectual section of it. But the “republic”
must protect itself, and protect the newly-
conferred “freedom of the people.” There-
fore it is necessary, as an act of self-preser-
vation, to class voters, non-voters and mem-
bers who disapprove, or are imagined to dis-
approve, of the new regime as public enemies,
and treat them as such. It is always done.
Even Dooley would have to hang Fuller
and his adherents if Dooley, in an ill-con-
sidered moment, had founded a “republic”
by forcible means which the law, provided
a change of Government restored the law,
must call treason and murder. And Garden.
in the same: position, might have to hang
both Dooley and Fuller. Certainly
neither could go for re-election in the ordi-
nary republican way when his term ran out,
and risk defeat; so the term of that kind of
president doesn't run out. Neither does the
man who has a tiger by the tail willingly
let go at the end of any legal period, and
chance the animal re-electing him by a large
majority for another turn at the tail. And,
finally, some privilege and license have gen-
erally to be granted to the army which covers
the “republic’s” dizzy operations' first to
prevent it turning against Robespierre, in
which case all is up with the Incorruptible,
and, secondly, because it is well that it
should be so disliked that it dare not let go
its organisation and join the people lest the
people should ungratefully cut its throat.

N.S.W. Railway Proposals.
N.S.W. Minister Ball has given an assur-
ance that the Condobolin-Broken Hill rail-
way—the great parched scheme that is to
hitch the-Farthest West on to Sydney—will
be promptly proceeded with. The line has
got as far as Trida, which is 465 miles from
Sydney and 129 J miles beyond Condobolin.
This terminus is a siding without any human
attendance —g board in the desert., A mixed
train runs there twice a week, and the loss
last year was £29,083, or about £244 per
mile. Another section has been built from
Menindie, on the Darling, to Broken Hill.
It supports two mixed trains per week, and
a passenger train runs on Saturdays if suffi-
cient inducement offers. This section is 73|
Jong, and the last year’s loss was
£28,435, or £387 per mile. When another
156 miles of line are built the gap will be
bridged and there will be a run of about
695 miles across dryest N.S.W. from Sydney
to Broken Hill. But the bridging of the
gap will certainly not wipe out the loss : on
the contrary, it will probably increase It,
because Adelaide, being less than half as far
removed, will still get at least four-fifths of
the Broken Hill trade. Still N. S. Wales
will be able to boast that it has established
a direct route from Sydney to Berth; but
as it will be only 300 miles shorter than the
old one, and will cut out both Melbourne
and Adelaide, and there will be breaks of
gauge just as there are now, many
travellers will stick to the old road, through
more interesting country. In any case, what-
ever trans-continental traffic comes to Syd-
ney via Broken Hill will be stolen largely
from its own Albury-Sydney line. Some-
thing could have been said for this or a
similar scheme 30 years ago, when a Cobar-
Wilcannia-Broken Hill line was first recom-
mended by the Public Works Committee;
but since then the Broken Hill mines have
been steadily depleted, and their smelters
have been fixed at Pt. Pirie. Even the
Sulphide Corporation, the one co. which
smelted on the N.S.W. eastern seaboard, is
now interested in the handy S.A., seaboard
furnaces. On top of that not only has the
cost of loans nearly doubled, but the cost
of construction has Quite doubled ; and Aus-
tralia has meanwhile accumulated a direct
and indirect war debt of £500,000,000, so
that it is so much less able to afford favors
to anybody. Nobody alleges in any convinc-
ing way that the proposed railway will pro-
mote land settlement, closer settlement, mar-
riage settlement, population (to any extent),
or new manufactures. All it will certainly
promote is debt; all it will certainly increase
is the burden of interest and unearned work-
ing expenses.

In the Land of Soft-Jobbers.
Australia’s prize exhibit in the soft-job
section of the Commonwealth service is the
Taxation Appeal Board. Its three members
—Lightband, of Brisbane; Canning, a
W estralian; _ and Twine, who used to be
Ewing’s assistant in the Taxation Depart-
ment-get £l5OO p.a. apiece and travelling
expenses (their headquarters are in Syd-
ney), and were appointed for seven yetirs.
There is also a secretary, who draws £362
p.a., presumably for brushing the flies off his
marble brow; and £lllO was allowed in the
1922-23 estimates for contingencies. Sev-
eral months after it was inflicted on the
country the Board admitted to Bruce that
it hadn’t dealt with a single case. Since
then it has been journeying from capital to
capital in search of something to vary the
monotony of signing receipts For the £125 a

because 90 p.c. of the people are unaware of
its existence, partly because the other 10
p.c. consider there is nothing to be gained

of the Board have completed their useless
functions they will be entitled to pensions
under the Hughes Superannuation Act. In
order to gather in the greatest number ot
votes that measure was made as elastic as
possible—it actually applies to officers of
10 years’ service who retired on the ground
of invalidity between December 31, 1920,

during his disastrous dictatorship, and the
superannuation scheme—which is hopefully
expected to cost a million by 1930 and from
a quarter to half a million per annum after
that—was his expiring present to his coun-
try. And such is the Australian politician’s
mania for quartering soft-jobbers on the tax-
payers that there were loud complaints in
the last House of Reps, because the other
States hadn’t boards like the costly super-
fluitv whose headquarters were set up in
N. S. Wales.
«,
Shadow-Sparring
The Sydney papers of Friday last reported
the usual “well-attended gathering of
women” who unanimously passed a resolu-
tion “to support any progressive movement
for the welfare of women and children.”
And their notion of adequately safeguarding
these classes was that “male degenerates,
drunkards, mental deficients and perpetra-
tors of crimes of violence should be rigor-
ously imprisoned,” and that “girls who had
become criminals in youth should not be
freed from control on reaching the age of
18.” It is only another proof of the fact that
many—perhaps most —women approach
social problems from the standpoint of the
nursery. They suffer from a fixed idea that
naughtiness can be spanked out of the world,
whether by prohibition laws or by penal
enactments aimed at sexual offenders. Simi-
larly, in other ages well-meaning reformers
believed that lunatics were possessed by
devils; and a vast amount of abominable
cruelty was perpetrated with the laudable
object of dislodging the non-existent fiends.
It is easy to prohibit alcohol, but since
Nature itself is a still under certain fairly
common conditions, it is impossible to effec-
tively ban the stuff. Anyone with the gift
of speech can deplore immorality and advo-
cate savage penalties for sinners; but, since
the procreative instinct is the most urgent
one known to mankind, it is absolutely im-
possible to prevent sin. As with alcohol, the
rational course, the only course that shows
results, is regulation. One of the most
practical methods of minimising the supply
of mental deficients (and 95 per cent, of
those guilty of sexual crimes belong to this
class) and of preventing girls from becom-
ing criminals in early youth, consists in
minimising the incidence of venereal dis-
ease. The medical profession is as ready
and as competent to do it as it has been at
different times to minimise small-pox, typhoid
and the plague. It was demonstrated dur-
ing the war that even under unfavorable
conditions—in lax England, for example, and
in the neighborhood of Asiatic cities —the
universal curse might be reduced almost to
vanishing-point. Every Australian State
has been impelled by war-formed public
opinion to legislate against venereal dis-
ease, but in no State is a serious attempt
being made by the Government to see that
the provisions of its Y.D. Act are en-
forced. In N. S. Wales, to borrow a recent
phrase of the Director-General of Health,
“the compulsory provisions of the Act have
only been applied to a very limited extent.”
In Victoria the average yearly number of
notifications is about 7000—a figure which
certainly does not represent a third of the
infections —and 17 per cent, of these patients
fail to complete their treatment. In N. S.
Wales about 25 per cent, default, and in
W.A. 27 per cent. In all the States quacks
are forbidden to treat V.D. cases, and
everywhere they are doing it practically un-
deterred. There are few prophylactic depots,
and at each attempt to institute a new one
a cry of protest emanates from the mis-
guided ladies who claim to represent the
interests of the women and children. The
success that has attended the efforts of the
R.S.P.C.A. has shown what an energetic
body of enthusiasts can accomplish. An
organisation of earnest women tvho got to
work on the same lines with the object of
eradicating V.D. would do better service to
their sex and to the cause of the children
in a month than the advocates of punitive
measures for sinfulness and its effects are
likely to achieve in a lifetime. Meanwhile,
despite the expenditure of much effort and
oratory, the feminists are getting nowhere.

“Dago” on government and chickens :
“Pontius Pilate” attempts (B. 5/4/’23) to
canonise the Italian Fascist!. He wouldn’t if he
had personal knowledge of the facts. Mussolini
had been a peaceful Milan editor and he had been
the Socialists’ leader; but he found that the mix-
ture of American Pinkertonism and Italian Camorra
which is called Fascismo more to his taste, and he
became the henchman of the organised Italian capi-
talists. To speak of Fascismo as being “the chief
upholder of the adult suffrage law, and a blessed
source of confidence to the terrorised Parliament”
is a jest. In the first days of Fascismo’s power it
forcibly sacked the popularly-elected mayor and
councillors of Milan (who were Socialists) and
appointed commissioners of its own to run the city.
Only a few weeks ago Mussolini did exactly the
same thing to the Rome corporation. Parliamentary
government has been abolished. There is a Parlia-
ment still, where they make very good speeches;
but, Musso. announced in Parliament itself that
if the members approved of his policy he was
glad to hear it, but if they didn’t he would “sweep
them out of his way.” So far they remain unswept.
But it makes little difference. The only thing they
do is to draw their salaries. They have as much
influence .on the course of events as “P.P.” or me.
The plain fact is that the Fascist “Government” is
an autocracy based on force, supported by Big Money
and served by paid cut-throats. Of course, it may
be really a good thing for the Italians to be ruled
in this way- It is even possible that they like it.
But it seems a bit superfluous to pretend that it has
any relation whatever to popular government, except
the relation the axe has to the chicken.

and religious squabbles are offending against
the Defence Act, certainly in spirit if not
in the letter. One regulation (111., 114 of
the 1905 print) forbids soldiers of any
rank attending religious or political meet-
ings when in uniform or on duty. Another
(11., 240) declares that a citizen soldier
shall he considered to be on duty in respect
to any act done with reference on his part
to his military capacity. A third regula-
tion (111., 108) warns militia officers that,
if they conduct themselves out of uniform
in a way they would not if in uniform, then
they weaken discipline and discredit the ser-
vice. The whole intention of the Defence
Act is that, as the force is necessarily com-
posed of men differing greatly in their poli-
tical and religious views, therefore the lead-
ers should eschew these questions as far as
possible. A permanent officer who took the
platform at a political gathering would be
retired. How, then, men like Ryrie and
Rosenthal who hold active and salar’ed
military commands can continue to take
active parts in these controversies is astound-
ing. If they themselves do not refer to
their army status their platform colleagues
invariably no. In England any omctr
elected to Parliament is immediately removed
from the active list. Why hasn’t such a sen-
sible regulation been embod.ed in our De-
fence Act?
“Azrim” : The results of the recent final
medical examinations at Melbourne Uni.
provide melancholy reading. Out of 135
candidates 68 were “shot.” Doubtless, by
assiduous reading, many will scrape a bare
pass in the subject that floored them, but
the fact that more than half of the cand.dates
failed to satisfy the examiners deserves com-
ment. The standard is admittedly high;
but it would be a grave mistake to reduce
it. The public must be safeguarded, and
the better-trained student, except in isolated
instances, is the better sawbones. But at
present the Melbourne undergraduate is
striving under tremendous difficulties, and
he will go on doing so until these things
happen: (1) A modern medical school is
built, say, in Lonsdale-street, close to the
hospitals, library and pharmacy college.
(2) Small clinics are established under compe-
tent instructors. (It is not unusual to find at
the Melbourne Hospital, for example, 30
students clustered around a case; and no
man can properly instruct more than half-
a-dozen.) (3) Senior public English is
made a compulsory entrance exam, subject,
thus barring the illiterates. (4) A com-
mittee is appointed with the power to refuse
entrance to those obviously unfitted for pro-
fessional life, thus diverting many able bil-
liard-markers and hod-carriers into their
proper channels.
Dear Bulletin, —You comment (B.
29/3/’23) on a statement of the Argus about
public opinion on some question. But is
there such a thing as public opinion—in
N. S. Wales, at any rate? In past days you
could certainly get an opinion from the
people whether they were for or against,
say, Freetrade or Protection. But now! If
there was an enforceable public opinion, could
you have the waste and mismanagement that
go on at Sydney Town Hall and in the X. S,
Wales public departments? All kinds of
scandals, all sorts of “graft” go on as
smoothly and regularjy as actual industries.
Men can rise, flourish and gain “honors” and
be fawned upon who wouldn’t be tolerated in
any other country; which explains why N.
S. Wales politicians, with very rare excep-
tions, are such a poor collocation of empty
cacklers and "mean whites.” Yet such is
the snoring Apathy of the people that these
can and do throw millions away and are
almost admired for it. The terrible truth is
that there is no identifiable public opinion
in N. S. Wales beyond the sheepishness of
following ‘‘the party,” right or wrong. It
is the one place in Australasia where it is
possible to fool all the people all the time, —
Pedro.
“1.R.H.” answers a call:—
“Radio” (B. 15/3/’23) asks why, despite the in-
troduction of the sensitive thermionic valve receiver,
long-distance wireless results are not what they were
when coastal stations were first established. The
fact of the matter is that during the past 12 years
the number of ship stations has increased enormously,
and interference b3 r jambing prevents long-distance
communication during the busy periods. “Radio”
may easily convince himself of this by “listening-
in” between 8 p.m. and midnight, when the greatest
volume of traffic during the 24 hours is being
handled. But let him try between 2 a.m. and
4 a.m., when the conditions of the ether closely
approximate those of 12 years ago in regard to the
amount of traffic, and he will find wonderfully in-
creased ranges obtained by means of valve recep-
tion. I have myself, in the small hours, worked
Sydney Radio while still GOO miles west of the
Leeuwin, and also Perth Radio at distances up to
2600 miles, with a transmitter. With
crystal reception difficulty would have been found in
bridging 800 miles. These performances are nothing
out of the way for low-power work. S.S. Tahiti
holds the record at 5200 miles. This is surely proof
that, given the desired conditions, long-distance radio-
communication, far from deteriorating, has been mak-
ing greater strides each year in keeping with the
advance of the science.
And just here ‘‘Cutty Sark” chips in: —
Nevertheless the Australian stations luive slipped.
The rot set in when the Navy Department took over.
Scraps of “Navy,” and other machinery, without
test of suitability, were installed in the various sta-
tions. Efficiency fell; but Navy heads, of course,
couldn’t admit they were damfools. At Sydney Radio
an aerial system, the result of painstaking experiment
by competent German engineers, was dismantled and,
without any test whatever, a showy “Navy type” put
up. Awanui (M.L.) has never been reached in daylight
since. Objecting to Hindoo-caste methods, a large
number of splendid operators left. On reversion to
the P.M.G. some time ago a start was made to
restore the stations. But Hughes sold thenr — On
terms —at a valuation yet to be made. Since when,
in the hands of the prospective purchasers, the sta-
tions have been let rip. Australian radio conditions
(climatic) are still top-notch. Recently Maclukcan,
Sydney amateur, using 9 watts (i.e., about one-
seventh of the power required to light an ordinary
electric bulb), easily exchanged traffic, in the day-
time, with a Melbourne amateur. With the same
modest amount of energy behind it a Gilbert-Sullivan
song reached Awanui. Since the Navy “conditioned”
it, this is what Sydney Radio’s obsolete spark, with
40,000 watts to help it, can’t do. Increasing to 20
watts, Maclurcan then established a world-record for
low-power radio-phone transmission, by consigning the
same song to Tuituila, American Samoa, 2660 miles.
There are men in the. P.M.G.’s Department who could
do as much. In my oponion the Hughes Wireless
Agreement should be dumped, and Australia’s radio
birthright restored to that department.
With a fine sense of the inappropriateness
of things, N. S. Wales Railway Commis-
sioner Fraser dropped into the midst of a
drought to preach at a Chamber of Agricul-
ture dinner on the text “Back to the Land.”
He declared with earnestness that railway
charges, which had been blamed for some of
the slump in bucolic pursuits, hadn’t gone
up very much of late years ; and there, at
feast, this paper is with him. Considering
the infamous swag of new political lines, all
good money-losers, that have been handed
over to the Department to nurse, and the
need to di£ up 5 per cent, interest on mil-
lions of money where 31 per cent, used to
suffice, the Fraser management has exacted
very little from the agricultural public. But
there are other things. Since 1913 State taxa-
tion has increased about 400 per cent., and
Federal taxes 250 per cent., while wages and
local rates and the cost of living have all
gone up enormously; and as the wheat in-
dustry was a poor one before these events,
people are no more likely to go Back to the
Land and stay there, unless conditions wholly
change, than the Jews are to go back to
Egypt and the days of Pharaoh. Inciden-
tally, a company-—only the first of many, it
is trusted —is being formed to establish a
chain of woollen mills ; and there is hope in
that direction, always provided Mr. Fraser’s
Railway Department doesn’t kill the woollen-
mills, as it killed so many country flour-
mills, by its fiendish ingenuity in discrimi-
nating between “up journey” and “down
journey.” The point is that Australia has
a sure market right at its door for £5,000,000
worth more woollen goods per annum, while
it hasn’t a local market for five pints more
wheat, though it may have when the woollen-
mill operatives arrive.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Land of Bottomless Pit Finance is
rather proud of the fact that it is the only
State which has got into debt in New York
as well as in London. But the little that
New York did lend was burdened with a con-
dition about quick repayment, out of revenue,
by means of a sinking fund. This put
Uncle Washington in the position of a pre-
ferred creditor, which is eminently satisfac-
tory so long as there is enough non-preferred
creditor to make the advantage worth hav-
ing. The loan therefore didn’t do a thing
to establish the State’s credit, and _ Uncle
Washington didn’t express any opinion as
to whether Theodore had borrowed too much.
What Uncle did say was “You must put
us in the same position as we would be in if
you hadn’t borrowed anything,” and by mak-
"ig him a preferred creditor that’s what
Theodore did.
A Commonwealth loan is calling for re-
newal, and Denison Miller, of the Common-
wealth Bank, has spoken the usual words of
comfort. A few of his sayings deserve pre-
servation :
... .Australia’s vast natural resources.... By virtue
of her promptitude at all times in meeting her com-
mitments Australia stands to-day an honored figure
in world finance. .. .Australia’s internal borrowing
policy... .Australia’s almost limitless natural wealth.
Australia, in its State capacity, owed
£27,468,000 more money abroad at June 30,
1922, than it did a year earlier, and, despite
the “internal borrowing policy,” the States'
foreign debts increased £6,000,000 faster than
the local debt. The amount borrowed abroad
was enough to pay the entire interest bill
and leave £8,000,000 over, and the “commit-
ments” were met all right. Borrowing made
it. easy—for ourselves. But it is playing it
low .down on the next generation, which will
have to meet the lOU’s.
The Anglican Bishop of Goulburn lias
defined the attitude of the bishops towards
the marriage of divorced persons. “We are
seven,” he said, “but on the question of
divorce we are one”; and he went on to
insist that not only was it unlawful to re-
marry a guilty party to a divorce, but it was
equally so to re-marry an innocent party.
“Nowhere,” he concluded, “has the Church
rescinded its adherence to the principle of
the indissolubility of marriage.” The reply
of the State should be that nowhere has it
rescinded its adherence to the principle that
persons who have been legally divorced have
a right, and what is more should be encour-
aged, to re-marry. The church law can only
operate, in many cases, as an incitement to
immorality. This paper doesn’t dispute any
church’s right to teach the doctrines in which
it believes, but it insists that the clergy who
conscientiously object to the State’s attitude
on the marriage question are the last people
who should be licensed by the State to cele-
brate marriages.
The English Electrical Co. of Australia
put a lot of money a while ago into woiks
for making transformers, and “immediately
importers dropped their prices 10 to 20 p.c.,”
and went on dropping them till they were
barely one-third of the old price. So the co.
says it can’t go on: one way and another,
there is a 50 p.c. protection, but “our costs
are 100 p.c. more.” They shouldn’t be, and
only “class consciousness” makes them so.
Instead of cursing the “employing class,”
what employees who are in danger of losing
their jobs should do is to tell, say, the coal-
miners : “Your dargs and your other go-slow
tricks are making coal so dear that our
bread and butter is threatened, and we are
not going to be pawns in your political game
any longer.” And it is not only the coal-
miners either. Excessive cost of railway-
construction, over-manning of railways and
tramways, go-slow everywhere are among
the thousand things that make costs 100 p.c.
higher than those of foreign competitors, and
leave the local operative no better off, even
if they don’t actually rob him of his job.
“Bat’s” idea :—•
One of Theodore’s reasons for rushing to the coun-
try is called the Loafers’ ‘Paradise Aet. All his pre-
vious taxes have hit the capitalist—hence the boast
that the Queensland wage-earner is exempt from
income-tax —but the L.P.A. is stinging the horny-
handed. It has been in operation for only a few
weeks, but already the railway workers are growling.
A large proportion are navvies and lengthsmen,
nearly all of whom at some time or other have humped
Matilda through the back country; and now they
have landed steady jobs—if anything dependent on
the foreign loan market can be called steady—they
have developed the notion that they are paying out
their good money to keep a gang of city loafers,
who in turn are keeping the pony-flogging industry
going in Brisbane. It is a mere 3d. a week per
head, but the objections to that thrippence are grow-
ing in bitterness and volume. The fate of Theodore’s
crowd is in the hands of the Government employees.
And well the latter know it.
The coal strike or lockout, or mixture, at
Maitland (N.S.W.) isn’t all misfortune, in-
IMMORALITY v. IMMORTALITY.
“The Customs Department has prohibited the importation of Boccaccio’s ‘Decameron’.”
CUSTOMS OFFICIAL: “Stop you? No, bless your innocent little girlish heart. It’s
these ’orrible immortal literary classics that I’m dead set against.”
asmuch as it has led Willis, secretary of the
Miners’ Federation, to expound the real
meaning of “socialisation.” This, he says,
is the thing aimed at: —
When 1 speak of socialisation I certainly do not
mean mere State ownership and control as exempli-
fied in the railways and other Government under-
takings. On the other hand it does not mean that
the miners are to own the industry in which they
are employed. That would be syndicalism pure and
simple, with which we do not agree.
We say that the public should own the coal indus-
try, that it should be nationally owned, and that
the actual administration should be vested in those
engaged in that industry, from the manager down to
the truck-boy.
Willis says his clients scorn the idea of
wanting to own the coalmines. All they ask
is a lease, free of rent and other payment,
for eternity, with the right of renewal; also
complete control. The public can then “own”
the mines. There is to be a manager, but
the truck-boy, an eminently responsible indi-
vidual. is also to manage. And prices are
to be as low as is compatible with “adequate
payment,” etc., adequate payment being as
high and adequate work as little as the
manager, over-ruled by the truclc-boy, thinks
right.
It is interesting to listen to these dear old
English Conservatives. At the annual meet-
ing of the great National Provincial and
Union Bank of England the other day, Sir
Herbert Hambling discussed the perilous con-
dition of British agriculture, and said: —
Something will have to be done for the farming
industry or they will refuse to grow corn [wheat].
I hate to suggest anything like tariffs, but.... The
principle involved is not that of Protection —it
is a question of the defence of the Realm.
Just as if that isn’t what Protection is and
always has been!
S.A. Government has decided to spend
some money to secure economy. Goldbeck,
the American “costing” expert, whose recom-
mendations have lately brought about such
drastic cutting down of the Islington rail-
way workshops staff, has had his six months’
engagement extended indefinitely, at £lOOO
a year. Premier Barwell has promised to
apply the axe wherever public departments
are found to be overmanned, and one or two
of them are looking thoughtful at the pros-
pect.
W. G. Gibson, the new P.M.G., is already
finding it difficult to do his best for all
parties. While lending an ear to the cities’
clamor for cheaper postage, he is compelled
to consider what his country constituents
will think. The average farmer doesn’t
write enough letters to be greatly affected
in pocket by a reduction from 2d. to 14d.,
or even to Id.; so all he can see in the pro-
posal is a vast reduction in P.O. revenue
and . a consequent further postponement of
reform regarding rural.mails and telephones.
Wherefore he and his missus are letting Gib-
son know just how they feel about it, and
that worried official is beginning to dis-
cover that his job isn’t all cigars, congratula-
tions and motor-rides.
The Westralian Cockies have served
notice to quit on Premier Mitchell, their
affable “Nationalist” ally, but it is not to
take effect until the general election, due
next March. Meanwhile Mitchell, who has
no collar-pride, will carry on. There are
18 Cockies among the 50 Assemblymen, and
17 Labor men. Of the others five call them-
selves National Laborites, one is an Inde-
pendent and another the lady who defeated
Mitchell’s Attorney-General, so the great
“Nationalist” party consists of eight mem-
bers. Not that it' worries Mitchell in the
least. , ’ . .
One wheat pool has been cleaned up, any-
how, and the last instalment paid to the
growers. It was the latest one —for 1921-
22; and it was the only one conducted by
co-operative effort, as the A.M.P. Society
is conducted. The pools run by_ the Gov-
ernment, and dating back to 1915, are un-
settled yet. This is natural. To be a Min-
ister too much depends on eloquence, or on
what people can be persuaded to regard as
such. The best potential Treasurer or
Works Minister in the country can’t get a
start towards the place where his talents will
be available unless he can first convince the
electors of (say) Blankville, not that he
knows anything about Finance or Works,
but that he can talk their kind of talk better
than (say) Bill Lambert. And even if
he “arrives” he has to spend so much of his
time in the House holding conversational
duels with the Bill Lamberts and others
that business has a poor show.
The Federal A.L.P. executive did as well
as could be expected with the heart-breaking
job of careening the N.S.W. Labor craft.
It got rid of the barnacle that answers to
the name of McGirr. That amusing mouth-
fighter was requested to step down and let
W. F. Dunn lead the party until Dooley’s
case should be decided by the annual con-
ference. With a few graceful remarks about
the utter rottenness of his opponents and
the malignant influence of Beer on the Fed-
eral executive, he whirled himself away.
Thereupon the 23 politicians who followed
Dooley and the 60-odd A.L.P. branches and
councils that “automatically placed them-
selves outside the movement” were forgiven
the wrong Maedonell House had done them.
Which looks like ending Labor’s last row
and worst —until its next.
Australia’s “Red objectives” and such-like
shrieky persons still depict the Russian “Re-
public” as a garden of Allah. The Man-
chester Guardian, the Republic’s best friend
in England, recently painted the scene like
this: —•
There is a widely prevalent idea in this country
that.... no further help is required from the outside
world, and that the survivors... .are able to look
after themselves, .. .No one can read the dreadful
catalogue of misery, want and suffering without being
moved to do what he can to shorten the time of
Russia’s long martyrdom. Large areas are still in
urgent need of food, clothing, agricultural imple-
ments, medical stores of all kinds, and of nurses
and doctors. Last year over 30,000 doctors and
nurses died in the famine. More than half the doc-
tors perished.
Russia has no foreign debts or interest on
foreign debts to drain money or money’s
worth out of the country as Australia has.
Last year this Commonwealth, a rather
barren place by comparison with Russia,
and said to be “groaning under capitalistic
tyranny,” sent away some £56,000,000 of
good victuals that it might meet outside lia-
bilities with the proceeds. This year it is
suffering from a drought (the kind of thing
they call a “famine” in Russia). Yet the
country pays all its liabilities out of its money'
or its credit, and doesn’t starve. And still
- there -mm. same -people. .mad ,ar Lad . enough
to want us to exchange our form of govern-
ment for Russia’s ; and our Labor party still
has Russia’s “Red objective.” It is a good
name for it, anyway.
Uncle Sam is beginning to think that it
isn’t all cocktails and skittles to have the gold
of the world in his hands; and he is yelling
at the top of his voice that costs must come
down. The more gold he got, of course, the
more boom there was; so now he finds natu-
rally that his competitors are beating him.
His trade balance for the first 11 months of
1920 was 2950 million dollars; for the same
months of 1921 it was 1976 millions; for
1922 it was back to 669 millions. And the
British payments are going to make matters
worse. Europe’s industrial troubles followed
close on the heels of the war. It looks as
though Uncle Sam’s were only postponed—
like his fighting.
The cattle industry is on its last legs, and
will soon be down on its last stomach unless
it is subsidised by the Commonwealth.
Queensland owns nearly half the cattle of
the Commonwealth, and as the next biggest
owners, N.S.W. and Victoria, use most of
their own beef, the export business is really
Queensland’s pigeon. Theodore’s Govern-
ment, thinking the pastoral tenant an unfail-
ing source of wealth, pursued him with in-
creased rents, fines, confiscations, etc.; still
there is meat to export—a lot of meat. But
when it reaches London it fetches a very poor
price now compared with the Argentine
article. Wherefore, the money received for
cold-processed ox sent abroad was only
£1,867,927 last year compared with
£8,819,841 the year before. One of the Kid-
mans says Australian beef has degenerated
till it is “no class,” and A. W. Pearse, also
well known in the ox line, says that too much
of the livestock has to travel to its doom on
Theodore’s trains. They are slow, bumpy,
degenerate and ill-managed, like so many
other things in the North, and are calculated
to bruise even pig-iron. One thing is certain:
the value of the export cold-sheep business
increased by £560,000 last year, while cold
ox slumped by £2,000,000, so the former held
its own against Argentine and all other com-
petition. But, then, sheep are not a Queens-
land specialty like cattle; hence Theodore’s
trains haven’t a chance to do them so much
damage.
BUYING BREAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A man bought bread with Nero’s face
On hammered silver long ago,
Where in some green Italian place
The summer set the vines aglow.
Beneath the elms that to and fro
Moved with a shadowy noontide grace
A man bought bread with Nero’s face.
A man bought bread with his red heart
Coined in a song he sang too well.
His rhyme was current in the mart;
The delicate slow cadence fell
Where merchantmen with goods to sell
Weighed out the small rewards of art.
A man bought bread witli his red heart.
A man bought bread with his grey sword,
Fierce bread of pain in smoky ways
Where cities ravished by the horde
Of spoilers saw their streets ablaze.
With the red coin that bitter days
Against an hour of reckoning stored
A man bought bread with his grey sword.
There is no truce to buying bread.
For this the round green earth was made,
For this the stars shine overhead,
For this the sunsets fire and fade. ...
God ! Let one baker’s bill be paid
For all the future 1 Life is sped
To the poor thought of buying bread.
n.s.w.

Income improved by over a third of a
million last year, but claims alone took
nearly £400.000 more, and,exes, also expanded
£.‘11,000; so the lay-by was smaller. The sur-
plus was also affected b\ the very large
amounts written off: £175,000 was added
to the investment reserve, and £00,405 net
was struck off the book value of premises.
For some years the A.M.P. has been taking
advantage of its prosperity to put its house
in the best of order, and the protection of
investments has been only one direction in
which funds have been applied to make the
ancie'nt concern invulnerable except against
national disaster. How the society has been
strengthened otherwise will be shown pre-
sently. The larger outgo last year was of
no consequence: £212,170 of the extra pay-
ments to policy-holders was in respect of
matured endowments, for which full provi-
sion had, of course, been made. Losses by
death were £343,000 heavier than in 1921,
but the £1,414,833 (including bonuses) was
only a few points more than half what the
society had provided for in its mortality
tables. Generally,: 1922 was a year of con-
siderable progress in the Ordinary branch:
the 14,011 policies for 4} millions which
were discontinued by death, maturity, sur-
render, lapse, etc., were replaced by 25,106
policies assuring £10,827,776. Including re-
• insurances.- at-- December-- 31 • there*•> were
383,782 ordinary policies for 122} millions
in force. Adding Industrial business, the
Society held 702,002 policies contracting for
more than 137} millions.
One feature of the period was the slight
reduction of tile higher expense rate experi-
enced in the Ordinary branch in 1921: —
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

1915.. 8 9 7 „ I 1921.. 10 2 5 ~
1916.. 816 3 | 1922.. 10 1 3,,
Calculating the cost rate on premium income
alone, there was a further small increase:
from 15.5 p.c. to 15.61 p.c. Insurance busi-
ness, like ail others, is naturally more costly
than in pre-war years, and as prenuum rates
were not increased accordingly—-there are
very good reasons why they should not have
been readjusted—the average cost rate has
expanded. That rate, however, is influenced
considerably by the amount of new business
written: the new policy-holder who is intro-
duced by a commission-agent, and who has to
undergo medical review and other prelimi-
naries, is naturally much more costly in his
first year than the old policy-holder who pays
in his premiums regularly on receipt of a
notice. If new business is large in relation
to old, the average expense-rate swells. Fewer
new policies were written last year; but the
average cover was larger, and so were aggre-
gate premiums. In this table the cost of
managing old business is reckoned as 7 p.c.
of renewal premiums (3 p.c; for annuities)
and the balance is charged against first pre-
miums :

Probably something more than 7 p.c. should
now be allowed for old business, but the
figures serve well enough as a basis of com-
parison, and show very clearly how costs
have risen. This new-business cost is a very
serious aspect of life assurance operations
nowadays: the Commonwealth’s biggest
office, with an organisation developed and per-
fected during nearly three-quarters of a cen-
tury, is paying away at least the whole of
its first-premiums to win new business. In
the young offices the costs are much heavier,
and they have no compensating returns else-
where in their business. Weighted down
with vendors’ scrip, heavy preliminary and
establishment costs, and, more often" than
otherwise, the whole of their premium in-
come having disappeared, the earnings of
funds are only trifling. But all the extra
costs which have been piled upon the A.M.P.
have been far more than covered by addi-
tional interest earnings. How these earn-
ings have improved is shown next:—
Interest Realised on Average Funds.

1916. . 4 17 f> „ 1921. . 5 5 5 „
1917. . 4 19 4 „ 1922. . 5 8 9.,
Whilst £106,377 p.a. more is bowing out be-
cause costs have increased £1 14s. 2d. p.c.
of income since 1010, the improvement of
10s. Id. p.c. in the investment return during
the same period gives £438,000-odd p.a. more
revenue.
The advantage gained from better invest-
ment earnings tand the favorable mortality
experience have enabled the A.M.P. to make
the best bonus distribution in its long career.
On June 30 £1,740,328 will become available
for distribution in cash as a result of the
past year’s operations; alternately, it would
provide reversionary additions of approxi-
mately three millions to policies, and most
of the money will be applied to buy addi :
tional cover. The previous year’s bonuses
amounted to £1,489,000, and during the past
12 months only £120,743 (8 p.c.) was taken
in cash. The bonus rate now eclipses the
performances of the boom years of the late
’eighties and early ’nineties, the ratio of
bonuses to premiums on policies participat-
ing in the distribution having been as follows:
1888-1893.. 40.3 p.e. I 1916.. .. 30.1 p.e.
1893-1898.. 34.1 „ j 3917.. .. 18.6 „
1898-1903.. 34.8 „ | 1918.. .. 32.6 „

1914 . . 39.2 „ ! 1921. . .. 42.4 „
1915 ... 30.8 „ I 1922.. .. 47.3 „
And if all continues to go well, the bonus
rate should grow larger. Thirty years ago
the A.M.P. was working on a 4 p.c. valua-
tion basis; that is, it estimated its policy
liabilities on the assumption that funds would
continue to earn 4 p.c. regularly. But ex-
general-manager Richard Teece, then, actuary,
advised putting the valuation on a sounder
basis. The old rate looked safe enough—in
fact, actual earnings never got below £4 Bs.
lOd. (in 1903) —but the wise insurance man
always keeps a substantial bit up the sleeve,
and gradually Teece remodelled his valua-j
tions on a 3} p.c. basis. Actuaries H. W.
Apperly and C. A. Elliott went one better,
and in 1921 £203,076 of the year’s surplus
was taken to place all Ordinary policies on
a 3 p.c. basis. There is a very wide margin
between that rate and the 5.4 p.c. earned last
year, and, consequently, a very large reserve
for contingencies exists. With a 3} p.c.
valuation the society could at present dis-
close 21 millions more surplus, and on a 4
p.c. reckoning 5 millions more. Having taken
all that was required for the more conser-
vative valuations, and having also built up
an investment fluctuation reserve of £375,000
with an appropriation of £175,000 from last
year’s profits, the way now seems clear for
bigger bonuses. In other words, the policy-
holder should now get more of the profits
which arise from premium rates being in ex-
cess of the amount actually required to give
the contracted benefits.
In the Industrial branch income is rapidly
approaching the million mark: —

1922.. 967,988 107,579 276,749 583,660
The expense rate has been got down to 28.6
p.c. of income—two points less than for the
previous year, and the best to date. But
that cost, compared with the 10 p.c. in the
Ordinary branch, is all the evidence a pros-
pective policy-holder should require to lead
him to where he can get a better deal
—that is, of course, if he can pay premiums
quarterly instead of helping to employ an
agent to collect from him weekly or monthly.
This branch showed a surplus of £96,409 as
at December 31, and £70,186 is to be distri-
buted in bonuses.
The A.M.P.’s balance-sheet total is
£50,630,231, and the present distribution of
assets compares with other years as follows:

No less than £29,649,000 of the £50,630,000
in the society’s care at December 31 had
been invested in public securities.
The Perpetual Executors, Trustees and
Agency Co. (W.A.), Ltd. —This is Westralia’s
new trustee co. There is only one other
local concern—the very successful 30-year-
old little West Australian Trustees, Ltd.
Nominal capital of the new venture is
£250,000, in shares of £1 each,' and 150,000
pa.d to ss. on allotment were ottered for a
start. The issue has been fully subscribed
and at the first balance (December 31)
£35,194 had been paid in. There was no
flotation loading other than £1360 which
went in brokerage and preliminary expenses.
The Act authorising the co. to get busy was
assented to on February 19, and the co. is
now seeking clients. Early in the proceed-
ings the directors purchased, for £47,500, a
six-storey building on St. George’s-terrace,
previously owned by absentees. The direc-
tors declare that it is a good letting proposi-
tion and was a bargain. Between August
2 and December 31 rents gave £1927, and a
profit of £155 was shown. The co. had put
£28,000 of capital into this property at
December 31, leaving £19,500 to be covered.
There w r as £5850 cash on hand, but the co.
was also obliged to provide for the usual
deposit with the State Treasury.
The future of the co. depends on its suc-
cess in gathering estates into its care. While
waiting for testators to depart it may make
a crust by working transferred trusts and
doing odd agency business ; and if the property
purchase was a good one, the crust may be
a little buttered by returns from that invest-
ment. An influential directorate has already
coaxed in some estates, and “prospects look
very bright.” Provided the management is
efficient, the Perpetual should do well, and
probably the old Westralian Trustees won’t
be injured; elsewhere friendly rivalry has
done much to educate the public to the ad-
vantages offered by trustee cos. which operate
with Parliamentary sanction and put up
guarantees no private trustee ever tenders.
It is unusual, however, for a new trustee co.
to put almost every penny of its funds into
premises. Properly handled, the risks of the
trustee business are slight, and if trouble
should arise there is £112,500 more callable
on the shares subscribed.

After paying the usual 12 p.c. divs., and
making provision for taxes, this old carry-
ing co. during the past half-year laid aside
almost twice as much as it did in the previous
12 months. Droughty conditions always
give it more work ; gross earnings of £55,633
for the half-year ended January 31 were
£5266 better than for the same period of
the previous year. Incidentally, book debts
at £149,408 were almost £15,000 larger;
but the m .nagement has a substantial inter-
nal reserve supporting its accounts, and the
business has always been free of visible losses
from bad debts. Only four years ago the
directors strengthened internal reserves by
dropping in £5OOO of premiums from a new-
share issue. Paid capital is £137,500, and
though that includes £25,000 of accumulated
profit transferred during the period covered
by the table, and a similar amount was dis-
tributed as a cash bonus in 1919, reserves
are £25,000-odd larger than they were prior
to the capitalisation. Having £114,753 of
visible reserves to help the £137,0u0 of paid
capital, the earning of good divs. is compara-
tively easy: total funds need return only 6J
p.c. to give 12 p.c. on capital. The co.’s

*Not including prefs.’ 6 p.c. ( £3500)
The form of the accounts has been altered
slightly: on previous occasions divs. on
prefs. (£.3500) were included with genera!
exes.; this year the distribution is more
correctly made from profits. In the intro-
ductory table, the pref. div. is still excluded
to maintain uniformity. The profits shown
there are not net, depreciation allowances
having been included and then shown sepa-
rately for purposes of comparison. The net
profit for the past 12 months was £43,278,
after £13,793 had been written off buildings,
plant and patents. Deducting the £3500
prefs.’ div. and £2OOO voted for superannua-
tion, £37,778 was' available for ordinaries,
equal to 16.8 p.c. on the £224,336"' paid up
at January 31. The 10 p.c. for the year
took £21,790, and nearly £16,000 was
laid aside in addition to whatever was
allowed for renewals, etc. Shareholders are
also receiving scrip for £56,122 of profit
accumulated prior to the 1922 balance, mak-
ing, with the transfer of four years ago,
£88,916 of ordinary capital, which has come
from reserves out of the total of £280,458.
Shareholders have now been fully compen-
sated for the years when they received only
a mild rate of div. so that the business could
be developed soundly. Between 1913-20 they
averaged only slightly more than 51 p.c.,
while £63,546 of visible profit banked up.
The co. has bounded ahead in great style.
Another view of 10 years’ progress is . given
by this comparison of balance-sheet figures:

Including the latest transfer from reserves,
paid capital has expanded from £145,019 to
£330,458. Shareholders have in the period
put up £96,523, and paid £1096 premiums
on new shares. Funds in fixed assets have
almost trebled in 10 years, and meantime
depreciation allowances appear to have_been
on a liberal scale. Except for a £17.000
mortgage on a city freehold, present liabili-
ties are smaller than they used to be, and
the co. now appears to be comfortably
financed: at January 31 the book values_ of
stocks and book debts totalled £221,560
against all liabilities (including mortgage)
amounting to £69,402. Despite all its labor
troubles and the difficulty of competing with
imports from lower-wage countries, the in-
dustry appears to have become firmly estab-
lished on a very profitable basis. The fea-
ture of Metters’ recent operations has been
that it seems to have escaped all the
troubles which its importer-competitors ex-
perienced when values crashed. That adds
another feather to the cap of the manage-
ment, in which this co. appears to have been
unusually fortunate from the beginning.

Great Pacific Life Assurance Asso-

young Australian Provincial Assurance,
which built up a large business in quick
time by strenuous campaigning, has been re-
sponsible for more new floats than any other

each, and of 100.000 offered at the start the
promoter demands no less than one-fifth (in

divided into 30,000 10 p.c. prefs. (non-cumu-
lative) and 50,000 ordinaries. The inclusion
of personal accident and sickness benefits in
contracts is the special line the G.P.L. pro-
poses to exploit. The float differs very little
from others so far as prospects are con-
cerned. The life-co. promoter has becc me so
casual when approaching the public for capi-

If you watch a small gang of men installing it you
cannot fail to be impressed with the speed of their
work. This simplicity of laying, when skilled labor
is so costly, is a factor of importance. But of
even greater interest and value to the engineer is the
satisfactory, economical and permanent water service
attained. It is worth while specifying Pioneer Wood

The slump in N. S. Wales gold-production
continues. Last month’s yield was only
882 oz. valued at £3237, compared with
33300 z. and £12,946 for the same month last
year. The quarter’s return was 55570 z.
(£23,607), compared with 57400 z. (£37,126)
for the corresponding period last year.
There is much alarm in official circles over
a rumor that, owing to the all-round decline
of the metalliferous mining industry, some
members of the Government think there is
no justification for continuing the Mines as
an independent department, and that it
should go back to the Lands, from which
it was separated in 1874.

Broken Hill South is successfully operat-
ing the first unit of its zinc concentrating
plant on the slimes section. This is the
first time the South has made zinc concen-
trate commercially, and the material now
being treated —slime-residue from crude ore
and dump slime treatment —lias hitherto
been sent to grass. The co.’s zinc middling,
still being treated by Amalgamated Zinc, is
a granular tailing, and will be concentrated
by flotation at the South as soon as the addi-
tional section is ready. The treatment, of
dumps for lead concentrate will be finished
about the end of this year. There will re-
main some hefty dumps of slime to be treated
for zinc, and they should turn in good profits.
Development work has been very satisfac-
tory lately, and an increase in output of
crudes is possible.

Vale of Clwydd coal (N.S.W.) has decided
that it does not require £30,000 of the £50,000
of gilt-edged and other investments it has
piled up, so the directors are calling share-
holders together to reduce the 90,000 £1
paids to shares of 13s. 4d. each.
Y-Water, Emmaville (N.S.W.), is in a
quandary as to winding up. A meeting called
last week to pass the necessary resolution
lapsed for want of a quorum. There were
35 holders present, representing 13,600
shares; a quorum requires 100 holders and
26,000 shares. The difficulty arises from the
fact that under the co.’s rules the holders
of 20,000 shares have priority of claim on the
assets, the whole of which would be absorbed
by them. If they all voted for liquidation
they would not have the requisite majority,
and there is no inducement for other classes
of shareholders to take the' trouble to vote.
As the possibility of getting a majority was
considered extremely improbable, it was
tacitly agreed that, in fairness to all share-
holders, the co. should reniain in existence,
and that an effort should be made to acquire
another property.

Westralia’s gold output still falls. The
March yield was the lowest on recent record,
and the quarterly return was 6000 oz. short
of the output for the first three months of
the previous year. Larger returns from one
or two Kalgoorlie mines and the resumption
by Sons of Gwalia are expected to check the
decline, but one by one the old fields are
failing. There is much talk about a revival,
but nothing is in sight to take the place of
the few big mines at Kalgoorlie.

Freney’s Kimberley Oil Co. has recently
completed voluminous reports, compiled
large-sized plans and collected fossils which
its geologists say are of “exactly the same
period as the mid-Continental, or Missis-
sippi, oil area of the United States.” The
cos.’s expert is now inspecting the work
done, and making a close examination of a
large anticlinal formation, near which traces
of oil are said to have been found. Boring
has been resumed at Mt. Wynne.
* * * #
The Locke Oil Development Co. proposes
to form a large co. to drill its own and
other concessions in the Nor’-West. and
states that it has been assured of “sound
financial backing in London.” Several
attempts have been made in London to raise
money for Australian oil-prospecting, but all
have been given the cold shoulder, and dis-
appointed promoters told to get some oil
first. All this co. has is a big wilderness on
which no oil has been seen to date, but, like
most other parts of Westralia, it has been
“favorably reported on.”
From Kalgoorlie:—
Hampton Celebration is only doing now what
should have been done at the start. It was a mis-
take to put in a plant that required an enormous
amount of water before proving the supply. The
plant, a continuous counter-current decantation
scheme, requires at least 30,000ga1. a day to keep
it going at full capacity; but the mine makes
only 8000 gal. a day. With this amount they can,
by juggling, get eight or nine hours’ run per day.
The management now proposes to instal filter-presses.
These are very economical with water, and with the
present supply Celebration tonnages can be doubled
with a very little increase of monthly expenditure,
and a decent profit should be obtained. If this
type of plant had been installed in the first place
the mine would have been in a very much better
position than it is. The much-maligned show has
never had a decent chance, but there is no doubt
that it will be all right if the tonnages can be got
through the mill. The ore and the gold is there,
and the management is now making the best of a
bad job.

Whim Creek (W.A.) is becoming more
active. Additional funds have been raised
in London on the strength of the rise in
copper, and the co. intends to make addi-
tions to plant, and to treat ore on the spot
instead of shipping it abroad. Development
work is also to be pushed ahead.
* * * •
Jones’s Mining Concessions, Ltd. (W.A.),
is still trying to sell some of its “finds” in
London, Adelaide and elsewhere. Recently
the Board gave a short option on six leases
to a London crowd for £35,000 cash and a
tenth-interest, but as an extension of time
was refused the option-holders withdrew.
Meanwhile, the Government is cutting tracks
and sinking wells between Laverton and the
“concessions,” and hopes are entertained of
a deal before long.

With the rise in copper, Cloncurry (Q.)
gougers are doing good business. In fact,
some of them have been holding on to parcels
for months in the hope of better prices. The
Fishers, of the Referee and the Crusader,
have been doing well with 30 to 40 p.c. ore.
The St. George sent away 12 tons of 57 p.c.
stuff the other day. The Native Bee is now
in the gougers’ tender hands. Before the
slump it looked as if development was only
needed to make it a fit subject for the Big-
Three. The country is kaolinised slate and
schist seamed with many copper veins; just
the sort of outcrop that looked like making
into big bunches of enriched ore. The tribu-
tors are now taking out bunches of 45 p.c.
stuff less than 20ft. down. It costs £3 a
ton to get it only as far as the Duchess.
What a world’s field Cloncurry might have
been! It’s copper north, south, east and
west.

The Kangaroo Hills field (N.Q.) is mak-
ing satisfactory progress. Geologist St.
Smith, who reported on practically all the
bigger mines there, is paying another visit to
bring reports up to date. The Sardine is
paying another 3d. div., and last week the
Canary had a small and very rich crushing.
Sardine North is still scratching for ore, but
in the Shrimp a rich vein was struck early
this month, although most of the ore in the
cuts is on the low side.
* * * #
Four leases have been taken up by H. R.
Broughton on the Mt. Emu field, north-east
of Hughenden (Q.). The Granite Castle is
the first on which he is trying his luck. A
crushing of 100 tons is being taken out, and
a battery is going up. Broughton has a
scheme for testing the Castle down to 500 ft.,
and is hoping that the first crushing will be
good enough to induce the Government to
grant some financial assistance to carry out
the job.

Little is heard of Indooroopilly silver-lead,
near Brisbane (Q.), these days, but Finney’s
Hill United can see a large tonnage ahead
for its new concentrating plant, which is
taking an unduly long time to get into
action. The United should spurt when a
start is made. Two adjoining shows are find-
ing the ore elusive, but on Moorehouse’s old
claim chances look good. Madden, who part-
nered Olsen in the original find, has a tribute
and expects to get ore in a crosscut at 95ft.
from White’s old shaft. The F. H. Block is
looking for the continuation of the United
ore-body, but nobody knows for certain
which way it is going.
* * # *
The Empress, Herberton (N.Q.), after
a lot of dead work, has struck the faulted
portion of the main Empress ore-shoot in
the 355 ft. level. The owners’ luck was in,
for when they got the shoot the copper
market had shot up £lO a ton. They will
now connect up with the winze from the
255 ft., which is down 70ft.
“Lux”: Gillies-Ditchburn carbide (Tas.)
is in trouble again. It has a big parcel of
carbide in stock, and is duplicating its plant
to 10,000-ton capacity. But cheap stuff from
Norway and Japan is flowing in, and an
appeal has had to be made to Customs Min-
ister Chapman for a renewal of the embargo
on importations for a year. That would
mean price-fixing. Why not? The sugar-
growers have had years of it. The beef
barons, after reaping millions out of
war prices, have just had one bite
from the Federal Treasury, and are to
have a. second. The carbide people have
had to give up everything to the war.
They proposed and promoted the Great
Lake hydro-electric works, but the Speck
Government, seeing the big possibilities in
the project, grabbed it and left only
carbide-making for the Gillies-Ditchburn
crowd. When the works were able to
start, war stopped the shipment of elec-
trodes and other essentials. The co. set to
and made its own: it took nine months and
a lot of cash, and ended in the Government
linking itself with the enterprise to prevent
its collapse. Next it was found that a
larger output had to be provided for, and
the Ida Bay limestone quarries properly
equipped—all to get costs down. This was
the last stumbling-block, and is the reason
for Gillies appealing for the renewal of the
embargo for a year. When the market was
at the mercy of the foreigners during the
war, they did not hesitate to bump prices
to £BO a ton against the pre-war £l4. The
importing crowd carefully refrain from men-
tioning that matter in their propaganda
against the local industry. The Common-
wealth —and particularly the Speck Govern-
ment—cannot afford to let the Australian
carbide industry go to the wall.

Last year was a lean one for old Mt.
Bischoff (Tas.) owing to poor tin markets.
Gross profit amounted to only £2545, and
when depreciation and other charges had
been debited only £5OO-odd remained. Opera-
tions were considerably curtailed: only 43
men were employed on mine work instead of
the usual 250. General-manager Gudgeon
reports that 1100 ft. of development has
given satisfactory results, but no material
additions to ore reserves. They now total
257,000 tons positive, going .35 p.c., and a
quarter-million tons probable ore. During
the year 1948 tons low-grade pyritic concen-
trates went through the roasting department
for 46.95 tons oxide (64.47 p.c.), the old
mill handled 630 tons for 7.65 tons (62.66
p.c.) and the new mill 4458 tons for 35.3
tons (65.74 p.c.). Two parties of tributors
were at work on alluvial on the Waratah
River and won 84.95 tons oxide, making the
year’s total output 174.85 tons oxide. It
is evident that the tribute royalties enabled
the co. to balance its accounts on the right
side. The treatment of low-grade pyritic
concentrates, going 2 p.c. tin, is now beyond
the experimental stage: since the inception
of the department 4500 tons have been
handled for 130 tons oxide, the recovery
being 1.88 p.c. tin, which is probably a
world’s record for treatment by the calcina-
tion process. With the return of better
prices the directors have extended opera-
tions; 40 heads are now crushing, and one
shift is treating 4000 tons per month for an
output of 20 tons oxide. Development and
general overhaul work is being rushed, evi-
dently with the intention of taking full
advantage of the market if the recent
improvement is maintained. Nevertheless,
shareholders must remember that the old
show has been well worked, and that only
careful management and good prices can
make one-third p.c. ore show a profit.
Bischoff has been a remarkable mine. Paid
capital is £29,600, in 4400 shares paid to
£5 and 7600 paid to £l. Since its inception
in 1873 the show has produced more than
44 million tons crude ore for 75,000 tons
oxide worth £5,285,000. The average value
of all ore treated has been only 1.17 p.c.
Crudes have been worth £1 3s. 4d. per ton,
and 11s. 2.7 d. profit has been squeezed from
that. Divs. have totalled £2,539,500, or
£2ll 12s. 6d. per share. In this comparison
of performances for 10-year periods the fea-
ture is the profit which has been wrung from
low-grade stuff in recent times: —- ■•■>*««

The hope for the future depends on unearth-
ing new deposits; and Government geologist
Mclntosh Reid seems to think this a possi-
bility. In his recent examination of the
mount he determined the economic relation-
ship of the dolomite strata to the tin de-
posits, and he considers that a likely spot
for a new deposit is at or about a junction
of these strata and the porphyry dykes.
These probable deposits and the small lodes
are looked for to give higher-grade ore which
will sweeten the masses of low-grade stuff,
mostly pyritic, available in Bischoff
That weary traveller, Mt. Jasper (Tas.),
bobs up again after three years. In that
time £5139 went in development and mill
expenses for a return of £712 from ore. De-
velopment account now shows a debit of
£21,799 and Profit and Loss a debit of £8866.
Mine and plant are shown in the books at
£21,048. During the three years since Mt.
Jasper last showed up the course of the
silver-lead lode has been followed in the
hope of picking it up on the timbered slope
of the Heazlewood hill. Even if the Jasper
copper lode is what it is painted metal prices
were too low to shake profits out of it. The
probing has brought to light a silver-lead
lode 24ft. wide. To give the ore a chance,
batterv treatment goes in favor of jig work.
The question is whether the mine justifies
the cost. Manager J. W. O’Connor thinks
so. because t:he hill rises 300 ft. in 800 ft.,
and should give him plenty of backs to draw
upon. But of ore is a small affair.
Years of work at Jasper and Heazlewood
has not demonstrated the inaccuracy of
Frank Powell’s pre-war advice to retire
gracefully. , * *
Briseis (Tas.), having completed diversion
of the Ringarooma River, is again operat-
ing on a profitable basis and, with the proved
high-grade wash ahead, it should quickly be-
come the Speck’s premier tin producer.
Summer water-shortage has always been a
trouble, so a large dam on the Cascade
River, about three miles from the mine, is
proposed. From this dam it is thought possi-
ble to work two faces constantly, and, by
additional pressure, increase the yield and
profit. A run of good profits for some years
seems certain.

Operations are still suspended at Pioneer
tin (Tas.) owing to water shortage. The
Christmas clean-up yielded 80 tons tin oxide
from a face of great width. Large granite
boulders have, however, been giving trouble
in sluicing, and have also apparently split
the lead into two sections. Great interest is
being taken in the probable strike of these
split leads, either or both of which may live
ahead or strike off at a tangent.

No. 6 Argent mine, Zeehan (Tas.), has
got on to some fair ore in the south drive
on No. 3 lode, and for the past four weeks
has won 90 tons of high-grade silver-lead ore
and 120 tons of milling (second grade) ore.
The present face in No. 3 south carries a
2ft. lode of good grade. The co. is prospect-
ing in and about the old British Zeehan area,
and may possibly come on a decent block of
ore missed by the late Tom Vincent.

Brown and Clarke’s, near the old Com-
stock, Zeehan (Tas.), has output 50 tons of
high-grade galena. An endeavor was made
to induce Melbourne to take over this show
—with the usual present-day Zeehan luck.

Doc. Pritchard has had some doubting
Tommies out to view his oil-bore cores from
Torquay (Vic.), and it looks as if he has
swung them into believing that he is not the
dreamer he was generally thought to be.
There is no doubt that he has proved the
presence of wax in ascending quantity as
depth has been attained. But, of course,
that doesn’t guarantee oil in payable quan-
tities.

John Brandon’s Waria River gold, Ger-
man New Guinea, has lost much of its
glitter. B. V. Barton reports that 70
samples from eight of the leases worked out
at only 3d. per yd. Shares which had stood
at £9 15s. slumped in 48 hours to 355. Bar-
ton is now having a go at the other 17 leases.
Brandon’s office has been out of luck, what
with the Block 10 Misima and this adverse
result from the big ex-Hun show.
After battling through tailings and worked-
out ground, which put the Profit and Loss
account £7335 on the wrong side, Kuala
Lumpur (F.M.S.) dredge settled down along-
side the old Kamunting patch to await a
better market for tin. Lately Ambrose
Pratt’s Melbourne friends have been supply-
ing cash to get the plant into trim and on
to the working site. An issue of 87,000 con-
tribs. was offered, three Is. calls saw the
show through until February, and another
■ shilling is expected to shake free all debt and
set the dredge at work in July. The co. has
about 300 acres of easy ground in which
boring has given pound averages.

“Wealsman”: Our bright eight-year-old
Pagan came pirouetting in from (State)
school the other day with the announcement
that her class was learning the “Fossils’
Creed.” “The what?" shrilled ma. “Oh,
you know —what you’re s’posed to believe,
’n’ all that,” explained the cheerful kid.
Straightway she started to give a sample
of the goods, and had got as far as “only
son our Lord, aceived by the Holy Ghost,
born of Urgent Mary, suffa dunda” be-
fore parental authority recovered sufficient
breath to intervene.
“D.” introduces a new indoor game-
An interesting pastime now that the evenings are
beginning to draw in consists in searching the news-
papers for cant, snuffle and Pharisaism. There is
never any lack of material, ours being a British
community, but a certain skill is required in assemb-
ling the material. Thus the London Bystander
(English papers are admitted under the rules) hoped
last January that the matrimonial canards respecting
the Prince of Wales would be discontinued by the
better class of newspaper: —
It is hard upon the Prince that the garrulous
suppositions of chambermaids should find their way
HIS DISCOVERY.
THE CURATE: “Do you know, I had no idea profanity was so
prevalent till I began to drive a car! Why, nearly everyone
I bump into swears frightfully."
into English newspapers, but you will remember that
it was a footman who was really responsible for a
sensational announcement of Princess Mary’s engage-
ment to the heir of a ducal house which appeared
some time back.
Nothing much wrong with that, you will say, barring
possibly the housemaidish style. But a few lines
further down the watchful player finds: —
It is a secret cle polichinelle that two dames of
high degree might now be wearing the princely
coronet of Wales, and the ducal coronet of York, if
they had not felt the position entailed too great a
sacrifice of the independence and freedom of move-
ment to which they had been accustomed from their
childhood.
Archbishop Mannix is always worth following, and
an outright win is often to be secured on him in
a single hand. One of his best performances was
put up in Melbourne a few days ago when he deplored
from the bottom of his heart the spectacle of the
empty Protestant Churches in England and Wales.
P.D.A. and L.O.L. rallies owe three points, and a
handicap of two is imposed on matter won from
speeches at Prohibition or King and Empire Alliance
gatherings. Anything emanating frrm Macdonell
House owes four, and Gregory McGirr in respect of
all remarks about his Labor principles is barred.

“To Po”: The impudence of the girl-
teachers giving S’Ralec Peacock back-
answers because he said their exodus from
the Department was for the purpose of marry-t
ing Digger farmers
reminds me of an in-
cident described by
one of them. When
on her first country
job she put up at a
bush pub, and in the
dim light of one early
morning she saw her
bedroom-door slowly
open a little. Then
came a hairy, claw-
1i k e hand which
stealthily shifted the
washstand that had
been made by the
scared girl to serve as
lock and key, and
finally a skinny arm
extended and waved
in the direction of the
bed. Just as the
young teacher, away
from mother for the
first time in her life,
was gathering strength
for a scream for help, a hoarse voice whis-
pered, “ ’Scuse me, miss—you’ve got the
towel!”

“Lexite”: N.S.W. Minister for Justice Ley
rather warmly told a recent deputation of
anti-liquorites that they had no right to call
the liquor trade “iniquitous.” Bung is so
used to being called names that he takes it
as a matter of course; but, actually, his
trade is as respectable in the eye of the
Law as the parson’s. Recently a suburban
cleric got a man fined for insulting language
because he had referred to parsons as “use-
less psalm-singing wasters.” Bung should
see a precedent in that.

“The Rumpus”: Perth’s tongue has been
hanging out, too, and Premier Jimmy
Mitchell is going to spend £3,000,000 in
building three new dams to moisten it. For
many months in North Perth ratepayers
have walked about exhibiting bottles of
strange fluids extracted from their water-
taps. All through Ministers have main-
tained a calm front, calling on the green
lawns of the
suburb as wit-
nesses that the
Government was
blameless. A
climax was, how-
ever, reached when
a huge meeting de-
manded of Mit-
chell the reason
why he didn’t do
something. M i t-
chell ponderously
passed “the baby”
on to God to carry,
blaming Provi-
dence for not giving
Westralia higher
sites to carry out
her town engineer-
ing. (This after
all our wide-world
skite about Mun-
daring Weir !) One
angry ratepayer’s
voice rose, and he
suddenly found
himself out in the
street with an IS-
stone policeman be-
hind him. Failing
all attempts to re-
turn, he whipped
home, changed into
a coat of another
color and a hat of
a different shape,
triumphantly pass-
ed tlie heavyweight
J. Hop, and was
just on the point
of moving a vote of no-confidence in the
Government, when chairman Carter, M.L.A.,
fearful of jeopardising Mitchell’s promised
outlay of £3,000.000, hurriedly closed the
proceedings.

“T.W.”: Whatever the way in the Navy,
officers of my battalion of the Suffolks always
had to salute the colonel’s empty chair when
they entered the orderly-room if the old man
wasn’t there. After that we had to turn
to salute bodily authority in the person of
the adjutant. I don’t know the origin, and
never had to do the same thing in the Sher-
wood Foresters or the King’s Liverpools, to
which they attached me later, nor did they
drill the idea into me when I was learning
the ropes in the Guards’ cadet battalion,
punctilious as thyey were about trifles of that
sort as a means of winning wars. But
the Suffolks are known as the Sele,” or
Holy, Suffolks (irreverently, in these days,

the “Sillies”). Perhaps the quarter-deck has
something to do with it, for SuffoiK's a sea-
board county, and, instead of being ruled oy
a Lord-Lieutenant, it calls the personage its
Vice-Admiral. Vic. Governor Stradbroke
holds the job at present, and is therefore
Admiral Strad in his own right.

“General Practitioner”: Do you wonder
the G.P. makes a beeline for Macquane :
street or the other haunts of the consultants?
If I call to see a patient frequently I am
trying to run up a bill; if I don’t, it is shame-
ful neglect. If I manage to go to church
and am called out, it’s “Working the Bob
Sawyer dodge, doctor?” If I don’t go, it’s
“How is it that you doctors are all athe-
ists?” If my wife calls on people, it is be-
cause she is trying to get patients for me;
if she doesn’t, it is because she is “too stuck
up.” If I cure a patient quickly—get credit,
you say? Oh, no. The patient wasn’t halt
as bad as the doctor tried to make out. On
the other hand, should the case develop
serious complications, “The doctor never
understood the case. In fact, the poor
dear was worse after taking the medi-
cine a week than when we called
him in.” If I suggest a consultation,
it is only because I don’t know what’s the
matter; if I say a consultation is unneces-
sary I am afraid of showing my ignorance.
If patients get worse it is the fault of the
doctor; if they get well it is the goodness
of Providence. If I send in my bill, “He
is in a terrible hurry for his money” ; if 1
don’t, “He is so unbusinesslike.” But we
get well paid, you say? Oh, yes-—if I re-
ceived payment for one-half I do, I should
die from shock.
* * * *
“H. Horsecollar” offers a reward :
Spookish whisperings have arisen by reason of
the death of Lord Carnarvon a few weeks after he
discovered and “violated” the tomb of Pharaoh
Tutankhamen. It is alleged that important Egyptians
of old hated to be disturbed after they had gone
to that long home where all was dark and stuffy,
and there wasn’t room to swing the sacred cat.
Therefore priests who were skilled in prophecies,
witches and knells manufactured artificial ghosts
or elementary spirits, and these did sentfy-go for
ever in and around the tomb, and bit any British
peer who let the air in. Against this it may be
remarked that Jannes and Jambres, the only Egypt-
ian miracle-workers mentioned in Scripture, were
an inferior pair, whose snakes were eaten by Aaron’s
snakes, after which they retired from the contest.
And if the mummy about which the fuss has arisen
is really that of the “Heretic Pharaoh” who intro-
duced sun worship, one would expect that his guard-
ian spooks would have been withdrawn and cancelled,
for when the old faith revived after his death the
things that were said about him in church circles
were such that respectable editors in Memphis and
elsewhere refused to print them. Three special
circumstances are quoted in spooky company to
show that there was something uncanny about Car-
narvon’s passing out. (1) He died from a mere
mosquito bite, which is held to show that the Old
Gods desired to express their contempt by sooling
on to him one of the most absurdly small weapons
in their armory. But the mosquito is believed to
carry the germs of every disease except housemaid s
knee, and it would have been a much more convinc-
ing evidence that the Immortals were huffy about
something if the peer had been torn to pieces by
elephants in the streets of Cairo, especially as there
are no elephants in Cairo. (2) The specialist who
might or might not have saved him met with obsta-
cles, but not the remarkable sort that stopped Balaam s
chatty animal. Carnarvon’s quack came by steamer
which reached Alexandria late ; he missed the train ;
no special was procurable ; and he had to travel by
a slow “mixed.” As to which it may be remarked
that plenty of steamers are so late that they haven’t
arrived yet; and if a medico was making for Men-
indie (N.S.W.) he would find nothing but a “mixed,”
and it only twice a week. (3) Finally, and as a
convincing proof that ghosts were afoot and magic
stalking abroad, the lights failed twice in the sick
man’s room before he passed out. And that is noth-
ing much either. Supposing the scene had been
Sydney instead of Cairo the telephone would have
failed also, and maybe the water supply, and it is
an even chance that an urgent telegram would have
failed to arrive for three weeks. So, taking all
things into account, the verdict of the jury is that
George Edward. Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, alias
Carnarvon and aged 57, just plain died —did a perish,
in fact. Still, to cover eventualities, a reward of
£5O is offered for the airy but malignant Nothing
that may have killed him.
“V.C.2”: Some people have as misty a
conception of filling' in their electoral cards
as they have of voting. I find it accelerates
things to fill in the cards and then hold a
patient forefinger beside the signature, line.
But a slightly deaf, gloomy old spinster
happened along the other day, and after
removing, and carefully blowing into, her
black kid gloves, clutched the pen and started
diligently on her card. “What do I put to
this?” she muttered, pointing to “Are you a
natural born or naturalised subject of the
King?” Raising my tired voice I said.
“Natural-born.” She wrote docilely, and the
finished product read, “I am an ankle-bone
subject of the King.” I gave her a second
card and she wrote “normal-born.” Then
I filled it in for her myself.

“Fana”: Tell “Three E’s” (B. 15/3/’23),
who admits to spending time ih Pitt-street
watching for a flapper with a nose ring,
after the style of her native sister of New
Guinea, that that idea has actually been
tried in civilised cities. Somewhere about
1912 the, French vaudeville actress Polaire
endeavored to set the fashion of wearing a
gold ring on (not through) her nose, the
ornament being fixed so that it pressed lightly
on each sdde. She was immediately followed
by a small number of women, but these be-
ing of what the S. M. Herald calls “a cor-

tain class,” the new craze soon died out.
There have been several recrudescences since
—one in Paris and another in Berlin, both
during the more hectic of the war years, and
within the past few months an actress in New
York appeared both on the stage and off
with a diamond-studded platinum ring
attached to her nose. The seeds, of the fash-
ion have been sown, and maybe we’ll see it
in Australia yet.

THE BARBER'S SHOP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Life is a barber’s pole,
Attractively painted and gay,
Lure to the motherless soul
That wants to be born some day;
The urchins from out-of-our-ken
Creep up to the swing doors, and stare,
And they giggle, or swank like men,
But none may come in without hair.
Life is a barber’s shop,
Gaudy with mirrors that flash,
Sleek horses with jockeys atop—
’Tis the shrine of the great god Cash.
Like the whiff of a stale cigar
Is Scandal’s malodorous breath ;
While Vice gaily flaunts in her car,
Poor Virtue is longing for death.
Life is a barber’s chair —
How fondly its strong arms enfold
As Time clips away at our hair,
He sells us a tonic of gold ;
And we clutch it as long as we can,
For the perfume is subtle and sweet,
But he deals with us strictly to plan,
And we shiver alone in the street.

“N.A.E.”: I hate untidiness, and when at
the solicitation of an archbishop there are
public prayers for rain we do it untidily.
Some places, when rain does come, get far
more than they need ; others badly in need
get none at all, or very little. If it is a
right thing to pray for rain it must be a
right thing to pray for rain in the right
places; and that being so a committee should
be formed to co-operate with the Archbishop
—a committee comprising, say, the Govern-
ment Meteorologist, the Government Statis-
tician, the president of the Farmers and
Settlers’ Association, the president of the
Licensed Victuallers and the secretary of the
Commercial Travellers’ Association. The
special knowledge that these possess should
make it easy for them to put our require-
ments into something like proper form. The
suggestion is bound to meet with opposition;
but it will be found that all of it is based
on its unconventionalism, and in a new coun-
try that shouldn’t stop us.

“Velu”: “Caballer” (B. 29/3/’23) can rest
assured that a bomb does hiss before going
off. The Mills bomb, in common witfi all
other explosive missiles which do not burst
on percussion, is fitted with a time fuse
which burns for five seconds before explod-
ing the detonator, Doubtless, “Caballer’s”

the burning of this type of fuse. When in
action with a Ist. Division Battery on a
particularly dark night in France, our load-
ing number turned to load rather hastily,
with the result that the shell he was hold-
ing received the full force of the gun s recoil
on its nose, and the shock started the time-
fuse burning. Fortunately it had nine sec-
onds to burn, and we jumped to cover. We
could hear the hissing of the burning fuse
quite distinctly. If that shell had been a.
high explosive we would all have joined
the Chinaman.
EOT GUILTY!
BINKS : “Ever get that giddy feeling when sitting in a tram?”
SINKS: “My dear chap. I’ve never sat in a tram!”
“Suggan Boggan”: It happened this
Easter, too. The bushman who got bushed
in the city was a grazier from Moonbah, and
lie not only lost his way but forgot the
name of his hotel and the street that held
it. But lie wasn’t beaten. He found a
post-office, and sent home an urgent wire
asking where he was staying. Then lie called
for the answer, and got it—the Postal De-
partment was extra slick that day.
“Stellsby”: Mussolini’s decision to revive
the fgte commemorating the rape of the
Sabine women reminds me that the “hood
of shame,” which the Maltese women still
wear, has outlived the stipulated period of
100 years set down for it to be worn. Tra-
dition has it that only one woman escaped
the French ravishers —she found eternity
by leaping over the bastion near the site of
the present Valetta Custom House. On the
opposite side of the Grand Harbor, not far
from the Naval Hospital, a roadside shrine
to the “sainted” woman is the receptacle
for many small coins from shriven women.
Incidentally, the “better-class” Maltese
women have discarded the “hood, but the
poorer classes, who are ignorant of its signi-
ficance, still affect it.
* * * *
“Cabbage-tree Bay”: There is an agita-
tion, or movement, or something on foot m
Manly (N.S.W.) to bring about the construc-
tion of a Dier, of the sort they have at Mar-
gate, Ramsgate and Brighton. It is to be
hoped that the comic municipal, council of
the charming marine suburb
may not permit itself to be led
into'sanctioning anything of the
sort. .Manly has been provided
by nature with a beautiful
ocean front, and a beach whose
sands are a delight to all who
go there to bathe or picnic. The
long curve of the shore, behind
the beach, is ornamented by. an
avenue of Norfolk Island pines
that make it an ideal prom-
enade in summer —none of the
other surfing resorts about Syd-
ney possesses anything like it.
This shady walk affords all or
more than a pier could do in
the way of providing a parade-
ground for flappers, ancient and
modern. A long wooden deck
stuck out on piles into the
ocean, with a concert-hall and
sideshows upon its upper stag-
ing, would inevitably spoil the
look of the bay. There is some
excuse for such contrivances at
the English south coast water-
ing-places ; for their beaches are
composed of shingle. But there
is none here. The scheme may
not come to anything, but re-
-1 membering the statues that
used to adorn the Corso and the
Esplanade—before newspaper
ridicule shifted them—one s°es
danger even in this Gpths’
scheme to disfigure what, after
all, belongs to Sydney and the
Ma State as much as it does to the inhabi-
tants of Manly.
“10-2-4”: I don't judge the Australian
worker as regards his clothes by the type
who goes pony-racing, as charged by Orp
(B. 12/4/ r 23). I mentioned this sport, be-
cause it Is at the Saturday pony-meetings
that the magnificoes of the proletariat are
to be seen in bulk, just as the Bruces of Aus-
tralia may be found in their gayest raiment
«t Flemington and Randwick. It is not
necessary to attend any kind of a sporting
event in either Sydney or Melbourne (I
know both cities, and affirm that, in this
respect, one is as bad as the other) to be-
hold plenty of horny-handed Brummels in
pyrotechnic shirts, high-heeled boots and
tucked and padded suits, over. the waist-
coats of which meander chains bearing
quantities of medals, charms and other
superfluous gauds and trinkets. The garish
creatures are in the city streets on Satur-
days and Sundays. The wearing of spats is,
as “Orp” notes, an imported idea—and so
is the wearing of trousers. But, anyhow, it
is a British idea, and there is a justification
for it in usefulness and comfort. The effemi-
nate boots; the pork-pie hats, with their
absurd ribbons and bows; the rolled-gold
chains, with their dingy attachments: and
all the other sartorial horrors of the male
workers are also importations. They come
from the ghettoes of Middle Europe via the
New York Bowery. Let opr workers dress as
they like, say I. But thev shouldn’t sneer
at the vanities of others. It’s the cant that
hurts.

“Wyngks”: Humor creeps into the
McGirr-Dooley rumpus from all angles. At
a meeting of a metropolitan electorate coun-
cil, strongly anti-A.L.P. executive, the. pre-
sident failed to turn up in time. A vice-p.
took the chair, and the meeting carried on
until 9.30 p.m., when the president himself
entered the hall breathless, with dishevelled
hair and clothes and bloodshot eyes. Mount-
ing the dais he addressed the wondering gath-
ering. “Comrades, need I tell you the rea-
son for my delay to-night? You must know
that there has been a deliberate and cowardly
attempt to prevent me attending. The
minions of the opposition nearly done for
me to-night, Comrades; but let me
tell you that I frustrated their plot
and won through.” The startling an-
nouncement caused some consternation,
and bloodthirsty resolutions condemning the
enemy were carried. It was the president’s
missus who let out the truth; and there was
a lot Of beer in it. But, as she said. “Of
course, he ’ad to pitch the mob a tale.”

to France. The 14th Battalion (Jackn’s old
unit) incurred a casualty-list on the Penin-
sula of 1188 (of whom 402 were killed) be-
fore the campaign in France started. - Its"
grand total of killed, wounded and injured
for the war was 352'5 (of whom 1049 were
killed). Among A.I.F. battalions the old
blue-and-gold has the following records to its
credit: The first V.C.; the first member of
the A.I.F. to die in Great Britain; the
voungest A.I.F. captain; the first chaplain
killed in action; the first D.S.O. won by a
subaltern. Charley Dare was at one time
the youngest colonel in the A.1.F., but his
record was subsequently lowered. Bill
Groves (now in Papua) was made sergeant
on his 18th birthday—that may be, but is
not claimed as a record. Another incident
that may be a record was the death in action
at Bois Grenier of the Moore brothers
(twins) of Ballarat, on the same day, July
3, 1916.

“Ring-neck” : The 40th Battalion’s history,
quoted by “Drayman” (B. 29/3/’23), is
wrong if it. says the 25th had the most casu-
alties (3068 excluding gassed). “Skipper
(B. 12/4/’23) has already proved that with
the 3509 of the 10th, and I can ram it home
with the 3233 of the 7tli.

“Cartot”: In an up-country town a few
weeks ago an exasperated blackmailee took
the law into his own hands and proceeded
to knock the stuffing out of a leech that had
been bleeding him for months. The aggrieved
person was an itinerant quack who, pro-
fessing to cure rheumatism and simi-
lar disorders, had built up a highly profit-
able connection. The blackmailer, an out-
cast chemist with the beer habit, some time
ago got hold of a couple of bottles of the
nostrum which the other was selling for 30s.
a bottle, or £lO a “course” of 12, and had
it analysed. The certificate showed the
quack’s yarn about it being compounded
from rare drugs,' known only to the discov-
erer, to be all bunkum —it contained nothing
rarer than a pinch of sodium salicylate,
worth about a penny, dissolved in water that
had been colored with cochineal. The
chemist thereupon called on the vendor with
the damning certificate —and received a nice
little sum for an undertaking to forget all
about it. But when the rheumatics mer-
chant arrived in a neighboring town and
started to interview his customers, he found
the other waiting for him, and another little
present was given and received. After that
things went from bad to worse, until a short
time back the blackmailer demanded a part-
nership in the business and asked for

father interested in indoor sports.”
ANGELINE: “Oh, he doesn't mind them if
they go home early.”
an inspection of the books. That was too
much for the un-Hicksonian faith-healer, and
a few minutes later a beery chemist was
startling the village with piteous squeals
for help. At latest the blackmailer was still
nursing wounds on the northern and south-
ern ends of his anatomy, and his erstwhile
victim was exploiting virgin territory in an-
other State.
VISIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The softly modulated lights,
The jazzing discord of the band,
The tinselled splendor of these nights
When Pleasure takes us hand in hand
And, for a fee in good, hard cash.
Leads in the scene of revelry,
Delights you, for the happy flash
Of rapture in your eyes I see. .. .
What pleases you, dear, pleases me.
But ’tis to me an empty show;
And only for the dream I hold,
’When Love alone induced that glow
That makes your eyes so warm, but cold
Would all your pleasure leave me. Still
The jazzing foolishness I stand,
Seeing it stirs your love, to thrill
Mine with the pressure of your hand....
I wonder do you understand?
Beyond this room where Joy has met
To seize its guinea’s worth of glee,
I see a shabby room, high-set
Above a dingy street. To me
There’s not an Eden on this earth,
Nor (if there be a Heaven above)
In Heaven itself, has half the worth
Of that where we —too poor to move —
Made Eden, needing naught but love!
With heart that smarts for vanished joys,
But still its tenderness preserves,
Amid the riot and the noise—
Signs of the world’s chaotic nerves—
I try to vision in the glow
,Such pleasures stir in every vein
Within you dreams of long ago,
Feeling your love thrill once again;
Pleased with your pleasure, and my pain

“Gallery” : One of the legends that perish
slowly is that Priminister Bruce had his
speeches prepared for him when he first en-
tered the Federal Parliament. It is true
that the young neophyte had a secretary,
but no one who had listened to the pol te
but halting stodge of his first orations would
believe that, it was someone else’s committed
to memory. The plain, fact about Bruce is
that his discourses always sound very proper
to him. His method of turning platitudes
into misty gentilities is part of his training
and mentality. There are speakers, like
Groom, who are as conventional in thought
as he, but there is a commonplaceness about
Groom (and others) that Bruce seems to
escape by some instinctive distaste for well-
worn adjectives and nouns. He is not a
striking talker—-the suggestion of a person-
ality behind the words is absent—but kis
feeling for a phrase that probably touches
him like a well-tied necktie marks him out
as a notch ahead of his competitors.
“N.D.”: P. G. Stewart, Federal Minister
for Works and Railways, has had some pre-
vious though unofficial experience in handling
a Works Department. In the days when he
was just a plain cocky in Vic. a party from
the Public Works Department started to
survey a road over the top of the worst sand-
hill in the district. Stewart, who always
had an eye to spare for things outside his
own boundary, buttonholed the boss surveyor
and pointed out that it wasn’t a scenic high-
W. A. PRETYMAN , Secretary for Mines
in Tasmania.
way that was wanted but an ordinary road,
and that by making a slight deviation the
sandhill co.uld be avoided, and the road
Tvould then be usable. The surveyor was
sympathetic,, hut.pleaded . that.as. his instruc-
tions were to survey a route in a direct line
from one point to another he couldn’t do
otherwise, and advised Stewart to lodge a
complaint at headquarters. The prospect
of storming that stronghold of red-tape single-
handed daunted even the pugnacious Percy
Gerald ; so he bided until the surveyors had
gone, and then went out one day with an
axe and shifted the route of that road. And
the Works _ Department which slumbers in
Melbourne is, I take it, blissfully unaware of
the fact unto this day.
George Gordon McCrae, the oldest living
Australian writer, will be 90 in May. Mel-
bourne winters have no terror for him. He
has his cold plunge every morning; then,
after a three-mile walk, sits down to his desk.
At present he is busy over his reminiscences,
which will include many anecdotes concern-
ing well-known Australian authors. McCrae,
as well as being a poet, has such a knack
for drawing beautiful ships that Oswald
Brierly used all his persuasion, but in vain,
to induce him to take up marine painting
as a profession.
“Schnorrer”: Although she was educated
in a convent and dissociated herself from
Jewry during her life, Sarah Bernhardt
tried a reconciliation only a year ago. She
professed a keen interest in Judaism, a sor-
row for having neglected it, and an enthusi-
asm for Zionism; and she ottered to tour
America, all the proceeds to go to the funds
of the Zionist organisation—the concern
which is re-estab-
lishing the Jews in
Palestine. H e r
offer was looked on
with suspicion, as
an attempt, in her
old age, to strike
the limelight in a
new way. In this
Sarah was less
kindly treated than
other Jews who
had forgotten all
about their reli-
gion until the
Zionist movement
stirred their imagi-
nations—Max Nor-
dau was one of
them. Probably she
suffered through
bei n g connected
wit h the stage,
especially as her
whole life was
theatrical.
F. M. MITCHELL,

of the Broken Hill
Proprietary Co.
AA illiam G. Collins, just dead at Newtown,
Geelong (Vie.), was a grandson of Col.
David Collins, the first Lieut,-Governor of
Tas. (1804-10), who in 1803 tried to found
a settlement on the coast, near Sor-
rento William Collins’s father established
Union woollen mill oh the Barwon, at
Geelong, which his sons carried on after-
wards.
Died in Melbourne, one of the older offi-
cers of the R.A.GiA.—L.U. Kyngdon, a
Brig.-General, who was in •command of the
Vic. arm of the much-retrenched gunnery-
remnant until about three years ago. Well
and favorably known as “Gruffie,” he had
an apparently bottomless well of anecdotes
to draw on at mess dinners. In his ver-
dant youth he took part in the Soudan Ex-
pedition ; and the Boer War was a later
trek.
‘‘Old Timer”: There is history in Burde-
km House, Sydney, just sold by Alec Hay,
■who married into the Burdekin family. When
I first came to the harbor village, Sydney
Burdekin ruled at the white-pillared man-
sion just across the.'street from Parliament
House, and was wont to turn up in the
Assembly late at night with another member
who wore a monocle and a roving eye and
was able to suddenly fill the empty House.
At Burdekin’s the schemes were developed
whereby Reid became leader of what was
then the Freetrade party, and Parkes went
down never to rise again. And, in the pic-
turesque phraseology of a famous publicist
of the day, Joe Cook (who left the Labor
party to become Postmaster-General in the
Reid Ministry) “spat out his democracy on
Syd. Burdekin’s plush pile carpet.”
Charles Stuart McPherson, permanent
head of the Chief Sec.’s Department, is first
favorite for the Vic. Public Service Commis-
sionership. Topp (1901-08) and Morrison
(1908-28), the first and second Commis-
sioners, were in the same job as McPherson
now holds when they were put in charge of
the Service.
George Brookman, 73 on April 15 —they
made him a K.B.E. three years'ago—is one
of Adelaide’s notables, especially in the finan-
cial world: It is 40 years since the syndi-
cate organised by him discovered the famous
Gold-en-Mile inWestralia. That find set him
well on his financial way after a period in
which wwalth. must have seemed to him
merely something to dream about.
Pleasant-faced and “comfortable” was
Mrs. M. Lalor, for many years one of the
best-known women in the Labor rpove-
rnent in N. 8. Wales. She was consistently
elected to the A.L.P. executive, -year after
year. Yet she was never much of a speaker.
Her strong- point was organisation, and she
successfully secretaried the Domestic Work-
ers’ Union for years. There will be a lot
of mourners for a big-hearted helper.

is about the only man in Australia who has
been a duly-elected member of both Houses
of Parliament in one State at the one time;
and he couldn’t manage it even in Tasmania
under the present law. His forthcoming
opponent is ex-cricketer Charlie Eady, -who
also wears a wig.
Dr. William Maloney, M.H.R., who has
just finished his 34th year as a Parliamen-
tarian, caused some fun in the Vic. Assembly
when he was new at the game by telling
Dicky Richardson (Creswick) to “go to
Hell.” Richardson complained to Speaker
Matthew Davies. “He told me, sir,” he
spluttered, “to go to the Devil.” Led by
Jack Murray, members promptly chorused,
“Don’t go—don’t go!” Richardson held his
ground till Davies remarked that there was
absolutely no obligation on him to accept
any suggestion made by an interjector.
M. B. Duffy, the new 7 senior vice-president
of Vic. Labor, is a likely starter for the next
Senate elections. He comes from Bendigo,
where he was • once lost in the scramble, to
become the party’s candidate for the Reps.,
but since 10.15 he has lived in Melbourne,
where he is building a reputation as a poli-
tical economist and statistician of the Sidney
Webb brand. Duffy is no elocutionist, but
his uncommon erudition in the subjects near
his heart makes him “meaty,” neverthesless.
Barring accidents, he should succeed McNeill,
M.H.R., in the president’s chair next year.
J. Arthur Dowling, solicitor, who will be 73
on the 28th, is son of a . N.S.W. District
Court Judge and grandson of the second
C.J. of the State. He served articles with
Edwin Daintrey, one of the old type of
family solicitor, and was admitted to prac-
tice half-a-century ago. The veteran, as
hon. sec., helped to build up the Royal Aus-
tralian Historical Society and has con-
piled much stuff on “Old Sydney” and
“Legal Luminaries.” His three sons were
flying men in the war, and only one re-
turned. Dowling’s aunt was the first white
woman to settle on the Darling Downs (Q.),
when her husband, Arthur Hodgson, tddk
up Eton Va-le.
Died in Ilobart recently, Theodore Percy
Arnold, grandson of the great Rugby head-
master, nephew of poet Matthew Arnold
and brother of authoress Mrs. Humphry
Ward. The latter, by the way, was born
in Hobart, where her father laid the cul-
tural foundations of Christ College.
American war- veteran F. S. Flint passed
out the other day at Cowra (N.S.W.). aged
80. He was a native of Hitehen (Eng.),
and in early life crossed the Atlantic and
fought in the Civil War. For his ser-
vices he drew a pension till he died. Flint
settled at Cowra 50 years ago, reared a
family of 16, and in due course 43 young-
sters called him grand-dad.
v W. H. McCarthy, the Hunter-street chem-
ist who died in Sydney last week, knew more
about the insides of/ more well-known city
people of the past half-century than any other
man in Australia. His shop was a sort of
interpretation of himself. In the course of
55 £ears it changed little in appearance, and
not at all in character. While rival estab-
lishments took to marble halls and soda-
fountains, McCarthy’s remained small, un-
pretentious, tremendously respectable. He
was a genial,, strong-faced little man, sugges-
tive of a priest _in mufti, who enjoyed an
immense popularity with his customers, most
of whom were his friends,
Ambrose Ifreeman, recently dead, was one
of five stalwart, sons of Henry Freeman, com-
mercial manager for the old-time firm of
Donaldson and Co., the head of which was
Stuart Alexander Donaldson, first Premier
of N.. S. Wales. Other sons were Henry
(who graduated in .the Lands Office and be-
came manager for Michael Fitzpatrick,
M.L.A., whose land business was a prosper-
ous one in the ’seventies and onward) : Wil-
liam, who was chairman of the Land Board
which handled the great Mercadool case;
and Stephen, of the Land Appeal Court.
“T. 0.1.”: Roy de Mestre has been awarded
the £250 two-years’ scholarship of the
Society of Artists in Sydney; and that re-
calls some old N.S.W. history. About 100
years ago Prosper de Mestre, an American
migrant, came to Sydney, started business
as a merchant, and was naturalised by Act
of the Governor-in-Council in 1835, When
he retired he settled at Terrara, in the
Shoalhaven country. His widow entertained
Bishop Barker there on his tour in 1856.
At Terrara Ettie de Mestre trained his race-
horses. In his name' Archer won the first
and second Melbourne Cups (1861-62) ; the
seventh Cup (1867) he won with Tim
Whiffler and. the 18th Cup (1878) with
Calamia. Although he landed many other
valuable races, Ettie de Mestre failed to
make a pile, and when he settled down at
Moss Vale or thereabout with his wife, it
was to run a large boarding-house.

matters in Sydney.
“Lexite”: Sydney lost a distinguished citi-
zen when “The Count” passed out suddenly
at Long Bay. He was buried as Charles
Frank Walters, but he had used so many
names that whether that was his right one
is uncertain. “The Count” had a long
career as a confidence man, and in 1921 was
declared an habitual criminal. Once a lucky
haul enabled him to deck himself out and
stay at a Sydney hostelry as a rich squatter.
He cultivated a newly-arrived Englishman
and sold him a half-share in two stations lie
didn’t own. Usually, however, he employed
his alleged title as a lever to get money from
people who were class-conscious in the way
the fiery Labor orator doesn’t mean. He
was 65 when he died suddenly of heart
trouble.
“Splinter” : It seems to be the open season
for Majors. Crane, P.M. on t]he .'Hunter River
(N.S.W.)y is no more unpopular with the
miners than Major Sanderson is among the
cockies of the northern part of the same
State. Sanderson is in hot water over the
ticks. He is chairman of the board which is
supposed to control them, but they are gain-
ing alarmingly on the coastal belt. The
cockies, whose hearts are nearly broken
whenever Strawberry has to go through the
dip, want complete control of the tick fight,
but they made such an unholy mess of it
on the Tweed River that the experiment is
not likely to be tried again. On the other
hand, Sanderson himself admits that the
Government has spent £700,000 and that the
ticks are thicker than ever they were. The
trouble with the Department is that it blus-
tered in like a policeman instead of acting
the mutual friend.
“F.J.”: Some April anniversaries: Poet
Henry Kendall, born 82 years ago on 18th;
explorer Hamilton Hume died at Yass, 50
years ago, on 19th ; John McDouall Stuart's
expedition reached the centre of Australia.
April, 22, 1860; Marcus Clarke, born 77
years ago, on 24th.
“Hooge”: I was asked last week to sub-
scribe to a testimonial to “Captain-Chaplain”
Wilson, of N. S. Wales, “in recognition of his
services as a Digger anrl Parliamentarian.”
I refused with gusto. The gusto was due
chiefly to the fact that this continued
use of a rank which, in any event,
never existed, nauseates me. One of the
bravest men in the late war was a parson
who might have postured as Captain-Chaplain
Mellish, Y.C., M.C. He wore the same
number of pips as a captain, for grading
purposes, in the Chaplains’ Department.
He preferred to be known throughout the
war by his correct style—the Rev. E. M.
Mellish, C.F. (2nd class) —and now he is a
plain parson once more. While attached
to the A.I.F. Mr. Wilson was rightly the
Rev. J. Wilson. C.F. (2nd class) ; the war
having ended, he became the Rev. J. Wil-
son ; his ministry having ended, he is Mr.
Wilson, M.L.A. He has no more right to
the rank of Captain than Julius Knight has
to be described as Emperor because he
once appeared on the stage as Napoleon.
The Minogue touch will continue to be
applied to Vic. Treasury. Pitt, the new
Under Treasurer, and Harnetty, who has
just been made the accountant, were his
trainees. He picked them out from less
progressive men, and could always rely on
them pulling their full weight.

man may be more really a king than any who wields

There are no traitors in my land
And none dare speak before me;
Affairs of State I understand
But never let them bore me.
The landscape shines where’er I go ;
My eyes like swallows skim it,
And I am boss of all the show
Right to the dizzy limit.
My palace is a glorious place
With crystal walls around it;
And jade and jasper columns face
The door by which 1 found it.
The papers tell me all I am—
A king unique and splendid.
I wouldn’t care a royal damn
If once my boots were mended.

THEIR TEST OF FAITH.
THE REV. MCTAVISH : “A h’me sorry , Mr.
Macintosh, Ah've heard o' your son's
drought losses. Our prayers for rain
were very heartfelt."
MR. MACINTOSH (of the general store):
Yes, hut of what avail are prayers
without faith/ Not one of the congre-
gation lined an umbrella. Ah was
hopin' they'd hae more faith —Ah hae
an' awfu' large stock o’ umbrellas.”
“Golub”: The other day, in a North Coast
(N.S.W.) town, a large green frog was found in the
act of swallowing an 18in. brown snake. The
amphibian had managed to get down about five inches
of the reptile, and seemed to have stuck at that, as
both remained in the one position for the next hour
and a half. When they were despatched the frog
measured six inches from north to south, and was
pronounced the largest of his kind ever seen
in that district. He was of the common species
of Rana communis. The snake was badly mauled
about the swallowed portion, and looked as though
he had been partly chewed, but in spite of this he
still had a remnant of life in him when found.
Both were preserved and are now on view in spirits,
having been replaced in the position in which they
were discovered.
* * * #
“Caesar”: Will Ogilvie sings the praises
of “the man who steadies the lead,” but here on
the Upper Brisbane River we go one better. The’
other day I saw a mob of about 100 horses swinging
into Linville trucking-yards with a horsewoman
steadying the lead. The prads were from Mt. Stanley
station, on the head of the Brisbane River, and were
to be trucked to Pinkenba, en route for India. Miss
Downey, the lady in question, not only steadied
the lead, but, as manager of the station, was in
charge of the mob. She beats a lot of men at
the game.
* * * *
“Bogan Bill”: A Dreadnought boy had
gone to work for a dairy-farmer on the South
Coast (N.S.W.), and the day after his arrival the
ctnv cocky was teaching him to milk. Having given
him a lesson for about half-an-hour, he asked choom
if he thought he could manage it. “I’m not too
sure, sir,” was the reply, -“and I’m horribly fright-
ened of cows. Er, would .you mind if I practised
on one of them poddy calves until I got used to it?”
“Ragar”: “The Deacon” (B. 22/3/’23)
asks if all horses can swim. No. I’ve known two
that couldn’t swim a yard—one in Bananaland and
the other in India. The first walked straight into
the river as though he was going to swim across,
but as soon as his feet lost bottom he made no more,
attempt to move than a barrel; in fact, that’s what
he floated like. I tried to keep him head on, but
finally had to tow him across. Practically the same
thing happened in the case in India, the only
difference being that there the beast was drowned,
and that without making a ny attempt to save itself.
Hundreds of horses I’ve ridden before and since
have taken to the water like ducks, and have known
how to swim instinctively, never having been in deep
water until I rode them into it.
“W.D.G.”: “F.A.” (B. 15/3/’23) may be
right when he says that the three-match superstition
was the outcome of a commercial age; but I heard
of it after the S’Afrfcan War from several returned
men. They all gave the one, and that a very feasible,
explanation—three men lighting off the same match
at night gave the sriipers time to draw' a bead on
one of them ; and three men close together made a
good target.
* * *
VV.D.G.”: As a sheep-killer my kangaroo-
dog wasn’t in the same class as “George R.’s” (B.
15/3/ 23), though by the way he started, he would
probably have broken the record. I got him from a
traveller, for a quid, when I was boundary riding, and'
I was showing him round his new home when he took
to a mob of sheep stringing out from the water,
lie killed 11 going out along the string and 8
bringing the mob, back. It all happened in a few'
minutes. Needless to say I dropped the dog, the
quid and also my job.
* * * •
“Judex”: Renata, who came into Wan-
ganui (M.L.) from a remote pah, had, amongst other
commissions, to purchase a wedding present for some"
friends. He decided on a clock which disclosed all
its innards as it worked under a glass cover. Stalk-
ing into the shop he said: “You get tat crock, eh,
in te window in te crass pottle.” “Yes, here vou
are,” said the watchmaker. “This clock will go eight
days without w inding.” “Eight days, eh! Py corry,
tat not bad, eh ! Say, how long she go s’pose you
do wind him, eh?”
EY| “Raupo” (B. 15/3/’23) has got
a bit mixed in commenting on “H.V.E.-’s” astonish-
ment at finding black bream in fresh water. “H.V.E.”
evidently referred to the sea fish widely known
among , N.S.W. fishermen as the black bream.
“Raupo’s” “black bream,” which he used to catch
in the Darr River (W.Q.), is not a bream but a
perch,-, a close relative of his congener, also referred
to by “Raupo, ’ the golden perch, otherwise the
yellow-belly of the Barcoo and the tuckeye of
the Balonne. The “black bream” of the West is
known correctly as the silver perch,., but is not to
be confused with the bright silver J, .bony bream”
which inhabits the same waters. As “Raupo” says,
the silver and golden perch are not confined to the
Darr River. They range all over the W. Queensland
rivers, being found in waters where the Murray cod
‘ another perch—is an absentee, and also living
alongside the big fellow.
* * " *
“Alkaloid”: The foxglove (Digitalis pur-
purea) noted by “Centre” (B. 22/3/’23) is poisonous,
though, of course, the results vary with the quan-
tity taken. The seed and leaf contain a number of
compounds of which the glucosides digitoxin, digi-
talin, digitalein and digitophyllin are the most
important. The foxglove is the source of the phar-
macopoeial digitalis preparations, so valued of the
heart specialist.

“Saaedi”: “Iluffin Guffin” (B. 29/3/’23)
winders if sheep are changing their habits, because,
whereas they once camped in a large mob, they now
tend to doss in small flocks throughout a paddock,
and also because a stout fence is now' required where
formerly a few wires' kept them from roaming. Both
these variations from general habits are seen usually"
in drought conditions. If there is a flush of feed,
merino sheep almost- invariably keep in one large
mob (longwools and various crosses are more indivi-
dualistic,, also more, intelligent). But under stress
of hunger the merino will abandon his communism;
also he’ll even overcome his fear of fences. Which
suggests that man and the merino have more in
common than .is generally, supposed.
UNMENTIONABLE.
"Can I help you? I know a bit about this make of oar.”
"Well, keep it to yourself j there are ladies present.”
lac Bushie”: Old Bill had lived out back
all his life, ar.d hud only once seen a train. His
general knowledge of the world was limited to Sandy-
blight Gully. I was out there during a recent hot
spell, and was reading to him about the forest fires
in America. ‘‘That ’counts fer it,” ejaculated Old
Bill, spitting into the fire. “ That’s where them
bla-nky ’ot winds ’ave bin cornin’ from.”
“Pick” f The warning that impelled “Ned
Kelly’s” birds to forsake their homestead tree (B.
10/3/ 23) was, doubtless, the premonitory creaking
and quivering that are sometimes perceptible for
days prior to the crash. I once had a sheep-collie
slut rearing a family of seven thoroughbreds in the
hollow burnt out at the base of a huge ribbon-gum.
It had been her domicile for -years, but one cold
morning she suddenly shifted 'to the inferior shelter
ot an old bullock-dray. 1 went to see what had
driven her forth, and, though I found no interlopers,
with every breeze I could hear a slight grating in
the wood, and silhouetted against the sky I dis-
tinctly. noticed in the topmost twigs an occasional
nod. and tremble.' The old fool-tree came down
two nights afterwards and smashed my flaming wheel-
barrow.
“E.J.D.”: “Te Whare” (B. 22/2 /’23)
says he has seen only one black snake with a dirty-
white belly, and. concludes it was the only one in
Australia. If he spent a month' snake-hunting in
the Pilliga Scrub (N.S.W.) he would catch black
snakes with clear-white and also- dirty-white bellies.
And no one would object if he caught the whole
dam’ lot.
* * '« *
“Jimmy Possum”: Let “Centre” (B.
22/2/(23) dodge round the stockyards in badly tick-
infested areas in Bananaland, and his doubts as to
the value of birds (some birds) as tick-exterminators
will be quickly dispelled. It if almost an every-
day occurrence, where ticks are bad, to see peewits
and willy-wagtails battening on parasites plucked
from the drowsy cud-chewers. .< Curlews, crows and
ibises, on the other hand, collect blood-suckers
which have dropped from the animals. But the best
of all feathered tick-exterminators is the farmyard
fowl. I have seen the whole fqmily of chooks go
out to meet the milkers as they' were being brought
home, and collect their supper from the udders and
thighs. \

To Po”: The aborigines from Lake
Tyers camped in the Cathedral grounds during the
Hickson healing mission at Sale (Vic.). A couple
of their number, paralytics, underwent the laying-on
of hands, and, after the first day, proudly exhibited
to all-comers their power to wriggle their legs. The
Cathedral choir spent every available moment in re-
hearsing Stainer’s “Crucifixion” for Good Friday,
and the blacks fairly revelled in the performances,
white teeth and gleaming eyes filling every door-
way. After the final practice a vocalist said to
one dusky listener, “We bin do berry good singin’;
pity you no come in.” History repeated itself
in the reply: “We all know Stainer’s ‘Crucifixion,’
and we would have been only too pleased to have
helped the choir.” The modern Sims Reeves col-
lapsed.
I .Q. : A word about onions. I marketed
2 - tons from a piece of land 125 ft. x 31ft. (less
than a twelfth of an acre), which I think works
out at a little over 28 tons per acre. Many of the
biggest weighed over 21b. each. I sold the
lot at an average of 2d. per lb., which gives a return
of about £5OO per acre. I grew them on my farm
.at Pine Hill,. Wolseley (S.A.), on a .piece of red
loamy soil which, had.'grown 'a 'crop of pumpkins
and potatoes the previous season. Besides the 21
tons of onions sold we used a lot during the grow-
ing season, and I gave a good deal away to friends,
which would account for at least another 2001 b. Is
this crop anything like a record ? The onions are
very mild and almost odorless; they were raised bv
Thomas Cox, of Serviceton, about 20 years ago, and
have been kept pure ever since.
* * * *
“ J.A.”: The casual visit of a sparrow-hawk
to the yards of a poultry fancier in our district
led to disastrous results. Fifty-two pullets two
months old were running in a fair-sized enclosure,
when the hawk alighted on the fence. The whole
mob rushed for shelter into a 9in. space between
the walls of the fowl-house and the scratching-shed,
and they piled themselves into a solid mass. When
discovered 28 were dead and four seriously injured.
As many of the birds were valued at a guinea a
head the panic worked out expensively for the owner.
* * * *
“Panta'gruel”: An immense fibre-ball was
taken recently from a dead Northern Territory cow.
It was 2ft. 3 jin. in circumference, with a diameter
of 6Jin., and tipped the scale at 31b. The cow had
been marooned on an island, and, after eating all
the grass, stripped the coolabah trees of their bark.
This latter, together with hairs licked from herself,
formed the composition of the bail. Cattle authori-
ties are unanimous in declaring this an extraordi-
nary specimen—and I'm not arguing with them.
"Bill R.”: I can’t- tell “The Deacon” (B.
22/3/’23) whether every horse can swim; but I
know that sometimes they won’t. At Sherringham
Lake (N.S.W.) I once saw breaker Harry Seccombe
ride a partly broken colt into deep water for a swim.
The apparently terrified youngster went to the bottom,
POSITIVELY UNPRECEDENTED.
STRANGER : “They tell me you've just had
the worst storm you've had here for
years.”
LOCAL IDENTITY: "Yairs.—trees was blown
down what 'ad never been blown down
before.”
ranie up struggling frantically, and went under again.
He' was assuredly drowning, so we pulled him out.
He became an honest stock horse, later, but always
resolutely declined to enter any considerable sheet
of water.

ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Egypt’s land had lightly spun
Three thousand times around the sun,
1 roni drifts of warm and quiet sand
The past came out to kiss the hand
Of a man with a thought and a new clean spade
Who dug to find how the world was made,
llie past came out with its dry, grey bones
And a few rich trifles, and stones and stones—
Always stones —and their size and weight
Were the cube of fear plus the square of fate;
for the simple fact through the ages calls
l hat the shape of the past was mostly walls.
When Tibooburra has lightly spun
Three thousand times around the sun,
A man shall come with a clean new spade
And dig to find how the world was made.
Start where he will, as the spade goes in
It shall strike through the sand upon rusty tin;
And the stratum of tin shall lightly pass
To rich deposits of shining glass—
Glass that is hollow and curved and thin,
With the cork pulled out or the cork pushed in,
But always glass by the side of tin.
Then the man with the spade shall understand
That we built our homes out of air or sand,
And wrote on the wind, or something like it
’1 hat has melted away, as the spade can’t strike it.
But far and far to our utmost station
Shall stay the brands of our civilisation—
Bottles and bottles and rusty tin;
And the bottles were probably filled with sin.
Oh, man with the spade, go deep, go deep !
If the sand be dry and the corks will keep
Through thirty centuries hot or cool,
There’s a Sporting chance you might find one full,
And discover by aid of throat and tongue
the taste of life when the world was young.

“A. Jocelyn”: I sold a cow some time ago
to a dairying bloke about 10 miles away
from my joint, and the other morning I
found her at the front sliprails, in the last
stages of milk fever. I attended to her
night and day for nearly a week, got her quite
right again, then took her back. I’m a poor man
with no false pride, so I waited anxiously to see
what the owner would sling me. I got plenty of
thanks; then he handed me this: “Well, Bill, you’ve
’ad old Strawberry close up a week now, and must
er got a fair drop of milk. Still, y'ou saved the
cow for me and brought her in, so I won’t be ’ard.
Dook us a dollar and we’ll call quits—what d’yer
say ?” I said for 10 minutes, but he only waited
for the first half.
* # * *
“Strenuous”: Re “Tough Mike’s” doubts
(B. 8,/3/’23) about the effect of a shot under the tuft
of hair on a horse’s forehead. At the end of 1918,
just before we left Palestine, numbers of our horses
were shot. I was on one of these slaughter parades,
and we shot about 800 —all under the tuft of hair.
Only one needed a second shot —and that was because
the poor old prad threw up his head at the critical
moment, the bullet catching him low on the nose.
* * * #
“Randolph Rentless”: There have been
terrible rows in our house,, but they have nothing
to do with matrimonial turmoil. The cat had kittens
and drowning was ordered. It was intended to
leave one, but an over-zealous domestic assassinated
the lot. After a frantic afternoon the mother cat
settled down quietly; and a curious household dis-
covered that she had possessed herself of a new
family—-of puppies. It was then the little terrier
bitch next door that became frantic. Ferocious was
the argument when she tracked down her offspring.
By agreement with next door the litter was divided.
This brought temporary peace, but further trouble
is threatened by the occasional attempt of the bitch
to recover the rest of her family, and by the more
frequent effort of the cat to annex another puppy.
GENEROUS.
MICHAEL: “ Keep your head, Pat—keep your head.”
PATRICK: “ You can have it, Mick —you can have the whole bloomin"
turnout in a minute.”
“Gaigai” (Papua) : “Wal’s” history of
the giant goanna in Papua (B. 9/11/’22) reminds
me of the snake with tusks, and, incidentally, shows
how stories of weird creatures get about. A native
policeman told Governor Murray that in the swamps
of the Kikori Delta, where Hurley was lately “explor-
ing,” there existed a big snake with tusks. The John
Hop himself had not Seen it, but old Senior-Sergeant
Semoi was questioned and he said it was O.K. He
also had not clapped eyes on the freak, but he said
Policeman So-and-so had. The latter was then sent
for and questioned. Yes, he had actually seen one,
and he described it. Where did he see it? In the
police-barracks at Kikori. Did he try to catch it?
“No,” he said, “you see, it had gone when I woke
up.” “You were asleep, then, when you saw it?” he
was asked. “Yes, I was asleep,” was his reply,
And he was quite serious, too.
“Ned Kelly”: Several old-timers were
discussing dingoes at my place recently, when one
remarked on a sure method of distinguishing a pure-
bred from one that has a domestic strain. The pure-
bred, he said, never barks ; even if taken when a pup
and reared among barking dog 3 it never does more
than yelp. On the
other hand, a crossbred
dingo will bark almost
as soon as he is placed
among barking dogs.
Does the Council bear
him out?
“Jim Dandy” : I
can assure “Azrim” (B.
15/2/’23) that the
expectorating reptile
that aims always at its
victim’s optic is not a
Kaffir myth. My bro-
ther, who has been
many years prospecting
and hunting in Africa,
and is now in Portu-
guese territory there,
tells of one of his
“boys” nearly losing
his life from the effects
of an eyeful of veno-
mous liquid shot with
amazing accuracy by
one of those snakes,
from a distance of sft.
or more. The nig.
suffered acutely, the
eye swelling rapidly to
an enormous extent.
The poor beggar belie-
ved his time had come
and would have died
(perhaps from sheer
funk) had not my bro-
ther got to work with
a strong solution of
permanganate of pot-
ash, at the same time
telling the sufferer that
it was a magical pre-
paration, and that when
it was once applied the
patient would ' surely
live. Faith in the
white man’s knowledge
did the rest. I don’t
think there was any
subsequent blindness.
If “Azrim” would like
fuller information of
this spitting horror I
can let him have the
prospector’s address,
“Snail”: An argument started up here
the other night as to what was the fastest sprinter
of all the animals. One hairy-chested cove put his
money on the horse, but some of the others thought
the real speed-hog dwells many miles from Randwick.
What has the Council to say about it?
* . * * •
“Jimmy Possum”: “Girofla’s” instance
(B. S/2/’23) of a child who w r as laid up for three
weeks through rubbing his tongue across the cut
surface of a N. Queensland lily bulb reminds me
that there is a soft, flexible, melon-scented vine,
pale yellow when cut, in the scrubs of Bananaland,
that will give you a taste of hell if the cut surface
comes in contact with
your tongue or lips.
The devil in it is sup-
posed to be crystals of
oxalate of lime, which
lie in the tissues of the
plant. A peculiarity
of these crystals is that
they have no effect on
an unbroken surface,
and become busy oniy
several seconds after
contact with inner
parts, such as the
mouths and lips. The
first sensation is a mild
tingling, which rapidly
increases, to the inten-
sity of burning needles
wriggling into you. I
initiated a youngster
once, and he was so
impressed that he cut
a number of cubes and
took them home for
his friends to sample.
How he escaped a vio-
lent death I don’t
know, as the young
imp told them to chew
the cubes and chew them well.
* * * *
“Pantagruel”: A petrified cocoanut was
found recently in the Marlborough (C.Q.) district
among the ballast taken out of a railway cutting.
The exact shape is still retained, and even the eyes
are apparent. When split in halves with an axe a
perfectly-formed kernel was disclosed inside. The
cocoanut is thoroughly petrified, and is as heavy as
a lump of iron.
* » * *
“Mulga”: A pal of mine had a fox-terrier
who was distinctly unsociable as far as I was con-
cerned. Then, one day, following a snappy whine
made by the tyke, I remarked that he seemed in
pain, and his boss explained that he had a trouble-
some tooth. As my job n life is manipulating
molars I made an appointment for the following
morn, and instead of Hicksonising the terrier I
extracted the offending tooth. The hauling out of
the tusk must have hurt him considerably, but the
relief that followed made us the best of friends, and
after that he’d wag his tail and jump up to me
whenever we met.
MAKING SURE OF IT.
“Wr-r-r —that howl’s a sign o’ death.”
“It will be if I get me gun.”
“Longpfella Boss”: Re “H.V.E.’s” surprise
at black bream caught in fresh water (B. 1/2/’23).
Should he visit the huge waterholes at Nelia Ponds
and Minnamere, on tributaries of the Flinders River
(Q.), there will be more surprises for him. I have'
seen beautiful barramundi, rock-cod (like the : chap
caught in tidal creeks and channels about Stradbroke
Island), true catfish, and the long dark green chap
like a huge garfish commonly known as “long Tom”
by sea fishermen, ; all caught in these waters. Also
at Nelia Ponds station they had the head and saw
(about Bin. long) of a sawfish caught in the ponds.
A true shark growing to about 3ft. in length also
inhabits these waters. All these are either tidal
or deep-sea fish. How did they get into fresh water
400 ft. above sea level and 250 miles from the Gulf?
* * * *
“ Jesmond”: Recently I started using a
pair of new blankets, since when the bedroom has
been full of blowflies. What is the attraction?
One explanation is that the blankets are made from
the wool of dead sheep ; but I doubt if that is
correct. As repeated washings with disinfectant do
not prevent the blankets and even the wall from
being blown, I’m daily expecting to be blown also.
Can any Abo. advise before the need arises for a
bluestone bath o’ mornings? P.S. —-Burning 70s.
worth of blankets is no good to me. P.P.S. —They’re
Australian blankets. Does that make any difference ?
* * * *
“TIL”: Re “A. Jocelyn” (B. 8/3/’23)
on St. John’s wort. For 36 years I have lived in
country which is the Australian home of St. John’s
wort, and all I can say is that “A.J.” has been
listening to drovers’ yarns invented for his special
benefit. Neither sheep nor cattle will touch St.
John’s wort at any time, no matter how scarce the
feed is. In the ’92 drought I was in charge of a
mob of cattle travelling for grass, and, although
the weed was all around them for weeks at a time
and there was no other feed, the cattle never
attempted to touch it, and we were losing them at
the rate of 10 and 15 a day.
* * * *
“Thurdex”: Riding a few miles from
Charters Towers (Q.) the other week, I came across
a dead brown snake about 3ft. long transfixed to the
ground by the beak of a jackass (also dead) —the
beak had passed through its body just behind the
head. Evidently Jack had made a miscalculation,
and the sudden end to his dive had cricked his neck.
* * * *
“Howitzer”: I knew one trier who “got
there” under a thundering big handicap. He was
born without arms, but, coming of a farming stock,
he refused to let this interfere with his ambition
of tilling his land. Eventually he was able to plough,
holding the reins with his teeth. He regularly drove
the six miles from Tallewang into Gulgong (N.S.W.)
—and his neddy was corn fed too. One mystery that
I never solved was how he could enjoy his pipe,
which was always in full blast whenever I struck
him. His jaws never seemed to tire. He recently
passed out at middle age and left a hefty bank
balance.
“Arclibell”: Some Abos. recently have
‘ tried to establish a friendship between kiddies and
snakes. What about this? A week ago I saw my
two-year-old daughter with the top lid off my pet
hive of bees. I didn’t wait to don a veil, but
sprinted to the hive and carried her away to safety.
She didn’t get a sting. P.S. —I would have written
this par. when the affair happened, but about a dozer
stings I got in rescuing the kiddy kept my eyes
“bunged” till to-day.
“S.A.E.”: Recent tree-climbing efforts of
Abo. axemen haven’t caused any shrieks of wonder-
ment out at Starvation Creek, about 20 miles beyond
Warburton (Vic.). 1 have it on the authority of
the bush boss in charge of the Federal Timber Co.’s
operations there that J. Corbett climbed by means
of spurs to the height of 180 ft. and then rigged his
staging and did his lopping from it. Another resi-
dent calculated the height at 170 ft., but 180 ft.
seems nearer the mark. Mrs. Corbett, the newly-
acquired bride of the axeman, was fastened into a
cradle and pulled up to the top by' means of the
gear Which her spouse had affixed.
'V * * *
“Colub” : A little while back a 4ft. black
snake was killed near Cangai, in the Grafton dis-
trict (N.S.W.), that was the host of a swarm of
small lice-like insects. They were attached mostly
to the under-part, and in some places were so
thick as to form patches. The snake was in
exceedingly poor condition —a comparatively rare
circumstance, seeing that usually snakes are at
least fairly well nourished —and this points to the
wriggler having been infested for some time. It
is a pretty common thing for goannas and other
lizards to carry a variety of lice which would
seem to be of a special repitilian brand, but this
is the first time I’ve ever heard of snakes being
infested. Still, many bush creatures, including the
wallaby', padymelon, kangaroo-rat, rabbit and
bandicoot, are verminous, so perhaps it isn’t to be
wondered at that an occasional snake should be
“chatty” also.
“Jackeroo”: In Queensland crows are
undoubtedly the worst offenders in spreading pricklv-
pear. They beat cattle and er>us to a frizzle. The
crow will breakfast off pear and lunch off carrion
fully 40 miles away, and meantime sow dozens of
seeds. Instead of devising chemicals and import-
in;; bugs to deal with the pear after it has grown,
why not endeavor to prevent its being disseminated
by these feathered agents? If a decent price were
put on crows’ scalps, bushmen would do the rest.
■» » * *
“Caesar”: Recent references to Jimmy
Ah Fpo, the Irish-Chinaman of Longreach (Q.l,
reminds, me that in those days there were four
things a bloke had to see before he could claim to
know Bananaland, and Jimmy' was one of them.
The others were the Eulo Queen, Jack Howe the
crack shearer, and Tyson’s head station. .
“H.E.R.” : Living on the edge where the
bush meets the city of Perth (W.A.), I was agree-
ably awakened the other morning by the unre-
strained laughter of kookaburras. At one time,
Westralia did not own a jackass, but some years
ago the Perth Zoo imported some and liberated
most of the progeny. Since then Jack has made
W.A. a home from home.
TROUBLES ON THE LAND.
“ Where’ve your been all this time? ' And
where’s the horse' — didn’t you take him
to be shod like I told yer?”
“Shod! Why, I bin a-buryin’ she! I
thought ’ee said ‘shot.’”
“Mugski”: How many bush people know
that the grasshopper sheds his skin? I’ve fed grass-
hoppers to young magpies, buried grasshoppers in
match-boxes, and done all the things to grasshoppers
that bush brats do, but I didn’t know till recently
they lived long enough to need a change of cos-
tume. Then I distinctly saw a ’hopper emerging
from his old epidermis, which I promptly collared
for my collection.

Everyone appreciates the strength and
fitness essential to standing up to
continuous hard work. Motorists
appreciate it in a car that runs many
thousands of miles without showing
any signs of the work accomplished..
They recognise it in their tyres, that
have to withstand the brunt of carry-
ing the load, transmitting the power,
and overcoming road inequalities.
In this direction “Railroad” "
DUNLOP TYRES
have won the appreciation of tens of
thousands of motorists on account of
their quality, staunchness and depend-
ability; which are so pronounced that
“Railroads” are easily the most popular
and most sought after tyres on the road.
They are undoubtedly the best wear-
ing tyres on the market. For economy,
value and long service they have
no equal. Use them—it pays !

The. Musical Association let off one of its
explosive gaieties in honor of ’cellist Jean
Gerardy and his tall wife —herself no mean
piano- juggler—on Friday night, and to greet
the pair Sydney’s song-cyclers frocked them-
selves in the season’s newest —there wasn’t a
frock present that looked a vegetarian nor
one waistcoat that shrieked of Bolshevism.
Jenny Cullen in a jetted frock, handsome and
worthy—the kind that suggests Aberdeen
rather than Paris —joined forces with pianist
Laurence Godfrey Smith and opened the
evening with a Brahms Sonata. The opening
and consuming of this oyster meeting appro-
val, Will Dallison perfumed the evening with
a few sprays of song, after which Laurence
Godfrey again sprang to the attack with
some old Italian music. Then Jean and his
lady were “set” for the march past, and the
flock was shepherded for the usual hand-
clutch. Mrs. Gerardy, who is a head taller
than her lord, wore flame-colored frocking
under an embossed velvet cloak of a rich
petunia hue that might have been flaunted
by I hilip of Spain. Manager Gravestock kept
a proud eye on his tall wife, who flashed
cerise satin draperies and a brilliant smile.
Mrs. Swinson, ■ rustling embroidered taffetas,
brought . her nice husband and her mother,
Mrs. Griffiths, who wore a fall of black lace,
arranged Spanish-wise over a comb in her
curling hair. Dr. Halloran and his n«w
bride were among the musical elect; also
brilliant Reike Parker, whose recital comes
off next month ; Roy Agnew, with a Prelude
dropping from every Anger tip—oh, and
hundreds of others.
Essie Acldand’s golden notes and artistry
will have a chance to earn all-Australian
recognition now that she has been appointed
soloist for the Jean Gerardy tour. The small
hall of the Con. was packed with enthusiasm
when fellow-students and teachers threw
their hats over the windmill in congratula-
tion one night last week, and, taking a ’bus-
mans holiday, celebrated their joy in music
ana such like. Essie, dressed in a happy
smile and a souffle of georgette and silver
lace, was overwhelmed with verbal bouquets,
and worked off her appreciation thereof by
bursting into song.
Harry Lauder’s lady wreathed her head in
a cascade of sapphire-toned ostrich plumes
and the rest of her in frocking to match
and drank a dish of tea at the Australia
one morning last week amidst a large com-
pany of her husband’s admirers. It was
mostly a well-upholstered female flock, but
here and there a male bird preened his
feathers or piped a deeper note to the blue-
eyed guest-of-honor’s memories of Caledonia
wild and free. The lady, who, by the way,
looks as kind and gentle as the blossom on
the tree, occasionally flashes a gorse-like
prickle of humor that makes you realise
that Harry probably finds his sternest critic
at his own fireside. Among the tealeaf-
consumers a pretty Woolf girl from Perth
sheltered under mother’s wing, and the Fan-
ning lass was smart in navy tailorings and
stone-grey furs. Isabel Fraser flew pillar-
box red millinery, and left the party early
with a view to cornering dad at the Lowder
collection and persuading him to the pur-
chase of one of its gorgeous Japanese robes.
Hays from Coolangatta and the medical
lvnowles, Reddall and Lindeman couples
helped to make the welkin ring.
The average woman might remain calm in
the presence of some of the queer little gods
and goddesses, with their carved locks
screwed back in tight little buns, that starred
the Lowder collection. And even the midget
ivory draught-players, which brought 30
guineas under the hammer, could not com-
pete, from the home decorator’s point of view,
with the luscious blue of heavily-embroid-
ered silk hangings, with peach pink and
cream birds and beasties crawling all over
them. The stitchery was something to induce
eye-strain even to look at. One buyer of a
century-old embroidered kim hinted that she
means to cut up the gorgeousness for
cushions. Remembering the evil eye that
Tutankhamen’s ghost cast on the peer who
helped to dig him out, this slicing of old
China may have its risks.
Legal Sydney broke away from fee-snatch-
ing the other afternoon to haste to the wed-
ding of Marjorie Ellison Rich, only daughter
of one of the Harbor City’s best-known law-
sellers. The young man who has undertaken
to provide her life-supply of bread and butter
and romance is Clifford Ross, heir of the
Charles Rosses, of Point Piper. The wed-
ding was staged at All Saints’, Woollahra,
and Canon Langley tied the knot, while
Padre Lucas stood by to trim the ends. Mar-
jorie swished a trail of soft white satin,
frothing over with georgette and Limerick
lace, between a lane of pews that had blos-
somed into green fronds and white petal
splendor, and was gravely attended by bride-
groom’s sister Joyce, small Anne Gordon
and Joan Rundle, and a smaller Stephen
child, all kbout as substantial-looking as
powder-puffs de luxe in their primrose geor-
gette frilly-frocks and tulle veils. Gordon
Brady stage-managed the bridegroom,
clothed in a subdued color scheme that toned
in admirably with the solemnity of his ex-
pression. Caradon, the home of Marjorie’s
uncle, Justice Lang Campbell, supplied the
roof under which the new Mr. and Mrs.
Ross received the congratulations of nearly
a hundred guests.
When old Bulletin contributor Cripps
Clark, of Goulburn, led daughter Geraldine
up the aisle of St. James’s the other day on
her way to a tryst with Charlie Studdert,
of Bungonia, the pair were repeating his-
tory, for in 1830 great-grandmother Margaret
Macleay, daughter of Colonial Sec. Alexander
Macleay (after whom Macleay-street was
named), trod the same aisle prior to facing
life in double harness with Major Archibald
Clones Innes, who afterwards gave Glen
Innes its postal address. Last week’s bride
would have made great-grandmamma open her
eyes, for a smart silver-tissue hat replaced
the time-honored veil, and her afternoon
frock of heavy ivory crepe cheered itself up
with panels of pale blue. One primrose-clad
girleen, Mary Lee, sustained the onerous
duties of bridesmaid, and the festal sand-
wich was consumed at the Feminist Club,
the party being stage-managed by Mrs.
Osborne England in fur-fringed mole silk.
Old Poverty Pointers will be interested in
a link forged by Padre Ferguson in his
Phillip-street kirk the other day. The bride-
groom was Will Liddell, of Essex (Eng.),
and the bride was Madge Lincoln, of Mel-
bourne, whose dad was •'Billy’’ Lincoln, one
of the Lincolns of the Lincoln-Stuart Pro-
prietary, and for many years a manager and
treasurer for J. C. Williamson. He was the
author of several plays (some of them pro-
duced in London and some in Australia),
and a pioneer in the making of Australian
movies—his best effort in this line was “The
Life of Adam Lindsay Gordon.” The bride
wore smart tailorings of grev with silver
trappings, and was supported by Uncle Dr.
Farnsworth. Paris House passed round the
sandwich.
Mrs. Stephen Laver’s alert face is pic-
tured here by May Moore’s studio. Its owner
comes from Crookwell, and hers has been the
hand that has done most of the building of
the Country
Women’s Asso-
ciation. She
might almost
be said to be
the backbone
of the Coun-
try Women’s
party, just
formed, for it
was her pro-
pos a 1 that
started the or-
ganisation. At
the inaugural
meeting Mrs.
Earle Page,
who was
elected presi-
dent, aptly
said that the
history of
Mi-s. Laver’s
life could be
, . _ . written
briefly: Always helping the other fellow.”
She has a clear brain and a ready tongue
tor the job, anyway. Though she is keen
on the Country Women’s party, she is
keener on keeping politics out of the Coun-
try Women’s Association. She supported
Mrs. Hugh Munro’s plea not to mix the poli-
tical body with the philanthropic one. Mrs.
Laver paid Australian men a unique com-
pliment when Dr. Mary Booth, at the pre-
liminary meeting of the C.W.P., expressed
the hope that there would be women’s repre-
sentation in Parliament. “We have faith
in our men,” said Mrs. Laver. “We do not
wish to be their rivals; we are only organ-
ising to help them.”
Ruby Davies, who was such an indefatig-
able war-worker, slipped away to St. James’s
recently and married Captain H. Binney,
trusting to his seamanship for a safe run
through married waters. Captain Binney
was for many years skipper of Union Co.’s
vessels, and now is in command of one of
the Commonwealth liners. His bride will
henceforth have a double interest in the
Rawson Institute for seamen.
The wedding of Val Osborne, onlv chick
of the Fred Osbornes, comes to a head in
a froth of satin and lace this week-end.
Handsome Alaster Gordon Davidson, lieut.
R.N., created a flutter in Sydney society
dovecots as a fine sample o’ a Hielan’ laddie
when he was on this water-front. Mrs.
Osborne took her girl to England a while
ago, and the wedding party is in London.
Dad was formerly in the Permanent Artil-
lery here—now retired.
Marie Sheeky, who has just become en-
gaged to Oliver Throsby Young, of Coora-
bille, Wagga, is a pretty little blonde, the
one ewe-lamb of T. G. Sheeky, of Yass.
Muffle .Layton is wearing a wonderful
engagement-ring that a Darling Point young
man slipped on the betrothal finger last
Saturday. It’s a slender twist M platinum
holding a black pearl, around which a circle
of diamonds flash. Muffle, who is the only
daughter of the Deputy Town Clerk Laytons,
is one of the most popular of Sydney’s
younger set, and her tall, slender figure,
exquisitely turned out, has been a feature
of every society function of note for the past
two or three years. The young man (if that
matters) is Edgar Rouse, whose father
helped to found the Australian Kodak firm.
When this Letter first asked you to say
“How do you do?” to Roy de Mestre, that
young man was spending his days in a studio
perched over a picture-framing establishment
high above
the mystery
o f Litt 1 e
George - street.
Roy was then
busy working
at the relation
of sound and
color. Getting
few disciples
to his banner,
he went back
to paint-
ing land-
scapes and
people as they
looked and
not as they
sounded. He
does this with
such success
that last week
he won the
two yea r s’
t r a veiling
scholarship offered to students by the Society
of Artists. Roy’s work has that rare quality,
imagination, and in his competitive exhibits
it shows particularly in his impression of
a sunlit green and a violet-shadowed orchard.
Roy is the second holder of a Society of
Artists’ scholarship; Lambert, 25 years ago,
gained the first. He comes from Moss Yale,
is a dinkuin Australian, and is one of the
De Mestres who used to win Melbourne
Cups. $
Pastel-colorist Mary Edwards was runner-
up for the scholarship with two of the por-
traits she submitted for the Archibald prize.
Mary excels in painting colorful materials
and hair ; witness the peacock tints of the
frock and the Titian tresses in her picture of
Essie Tindall. Grace Crowley is anothes
Sydney lass who shows good form with the
brush, and her drawing is particularly strong.
Well, there’ll be other prizes.
Mr. and Mrs. Prank White are among
the honeymoon couples with whom at the
moment the Blue Mountains are thickly
studded. Mrs. White used to be Nurse
Mallee McCourt, one of the twin daughters
of the late Speaker McCourt. Mrs. McCourt
being in Hobart, her son Rupert and his
wife upheld the family’s rights at the wee
church which nestles amid the rocks at
Vaueluse. Wilton McCourt and his musi-
cal wife were there also, and Darli McCourt
made a sweet little bridesmaid.
Dr. Chisholm Ross has just handed out
another parental blessing. This time it’s to
daughter Sheila on her engagement to Wil-
liam Cromar Peters.
Good-looking Lorna Payten, whose dad
used to be one of Sydney’s racing identities,
was another of last week’s brides, and in
transfer became Mrs. J. S. Maloney, of
A 1 bury. She is now entangled up matrimoni-
ally with contralto Ella Caspers who was.
Elizabeth Drummond Leonard (she an-
swers to the name of Bessie), only child of
the James Drummond Leonards, of Strath-
field, has engaged herself to William John
Fraser, eldest son of the Duncan Frasers, of
Eulo station.
The £55,000 paid last week for Burdekin
House by a Sydney hotel syndicate repre-
sents, it is said, little more than the value
of the land. Yet the prospective hand-
ing-over of the big Macquarie-street mansion
to the house-breakers offers one of those
millionaire squatters who think nothing of
picking up £30,000 in one bet a priceless
opportunity to acquire a really creditable
country home. Burdekin House was never
meant to be closed in by skyscrapers. It
would look glorious on the crest of a gentle
rise, and with its wide, deep verandah and
its balcony formed by the verandah-roof,
would make an ideal hot-weatlier home. With
the exception of the woodwork at the back
it is in as good repair as on the day it was
built.
Mrs. Tennant —she was Noni Fiasc-hi, the
veteran medico’s younger daughter—lately
came all the way from Europe, bringing her
kiddies with her, to pay a visit to father.
She goes back by the Themistocles. Her
sister, Clarissa, is now the Marchesa Torri-
giani, whose husband is a relative of the
late R.C. Bishop of Armidale. Clarissa’s
first. romantic engagement never reached
fruition—her fiance died. But he left her
his estate; and at the time of her marriage
the young lady was a considerable heiress.
. fi rs t of the film theatre benefit nights
m aid of the Starving Children of Europe
1 unds will be given in the Croydon de Luxe
Picture Theatre on the 26th.
Chief traffic-manager Doran, of the Tram-
ways, entertained 120 members of Ye Idlers
Club and their friends at a cinema lecture
at the Highland Society’s rooms the other
night, and among the guests were two of
Brisbane’s brightest tramway brass-hats.
Of course, our system is infinitely superior
to any other system ; anyway, it has attracted
this much attention elsewhere: the U.S.A.
has asked the lecturer to supply a complete
set of slides and full information as to our
way of doing it. At Randwick the other
day the 93,000 or so people were shifted
at the rate of 1700 per minute! So pause
the next time you feel inclined to throw a
carrot at the conductor’s head.
Untiring in her efforts to make the sailors’
lot a happier one, Mrs. Arthur Scrivener,
aided by clever Enid Deloitte, is secretary-
ing a concert to be held at the Conserva-
torium on the 23rd. Its object is to add
a bit more to the funds of the Rawson Insti-
tute. Plan at Paling’s.
Mrs. Scrivener, by the way, was made a
grandmother last week. It’s a way these
soldier-sons have. The news was cabled
from India, where Captain Bertie Scrivener
is again with his regiment.
Harry Lauder’s wee bit kiltie was the skirt
that drew Grammar School boys down
Paling’s lane to the concert hall one after-
noon last week. They came with some dim
notion that Harry Lauder was going to
oblige with a few songs, and they had been
invited by the “Combined Women’s Leagues”
- —to supply the applause for the afternoon’s
entertainment, as they were naively informed
on arrival. Everything fell out for the best.
Harry and his blue-eyed “Annie” were late,
having got entangled in the wilds of the
Domain; but they made themselves doubly
agreeable when they did arrive. They shook
hands all round with the junior Red Crossers
who formed a guard of honor; they poured
congratulations on the small boys who
shrilled bird calls at them; then, mounting
the small stage, the Knight told the boys how
his first job went from six in the morning till
six at night——aye, and how his second job
in the mines (he being then a man of 13)
ran all round the clock. Then he moralised
a bit, as is his way, and after that sang them
two songs in the best- Lauder way. If after
that Mrs. Mackinnon decanted heady
draughts of folklore the small boy audience
didn’t hear, for, folding its raincoat like
the arab, it silently faded away.
There was a brief reference in the cable
the other day to preliminary steps for the un-
marrying of Anthony Hordern and his
statuesque wife, whose well-robed figure Syd-
ney used to know. This Anthony was that
scion of the Sydney trading family who
started the A. and A. Hordern firm after his
return from England with the wife he mar-
ried there in 1901. It is the lady who took
action, asking for a decree* for the restitution
of rights, and the Judge granted the applica-
tion.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Arthur Stanley and his lady, who are explor-
ing Queensland, have made a start with Government
House. There they discovered Sir Matthew, Northern
Territory Administrator Urquhart and his wife, with
son-in-law George Addison and daughter Miriam
round a lunch table.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers is breathing the scent of the
gum-shoots at Coochin station, where the Prince did
so much racing and chasing with the Bells.
Mary, disguised as Maud Fane, in demure cinna-
mon brown, made her first appearance in Brisbane)
on the 7th, when the City’s best assembled in His
Majesty’s to see the frisking and frolicking. Amoa g
those who had a date with the J.C.W. production
were the Bob Cowlishaws, a smattering of Perf ses
and Hertzbergs, the Bob McCowans, with daug’ iter
Nancy, Blanche Macauley, Mrs. Harry Mills, /japt.
Harry Hammond, A.D.C., Dulcie Crane, and the
Clive Morcoms.
Mrs. Ted Theodore, following the custom of the
Ryans, has gone north with her Premier, election-
eering.
Kitty, youngest of the Oxford Downs Sh annons,
said “I will” (with, probably, the customary reser-
vations) to J. W. Inverarity, of Palms estate,
Mackay, at All Saints’, Brisbane, the other dav.
She did it in satin with a pink-lined train of geor-
gette and silver. The bride and bridegroom’s sisters
were enclosed in pink georgette. A. L. E:lack was
best man, Will Shannon groomsman and Pauline
Elliot added the “Beloved-It-Is-Morn” tovjch. The
honeymoon rises over the Blue Mountains.'
The father of painter George Rand,-HI gleaned
about 30 of his son’s oils for the Randall Art
Gallery, South Brisbane, during his recent trip to
the Cold Country. The fields searched successfully
were Piccadilly, R. I. Gallery, the British Colonial
Art Exhibition, and a lone-hand show engineered bv
Graves, of Pall Mall.
A May wedding that threatens to open Toowoomba’s
social eye is that of the dazzlingly blonde and popu-
lar May Leichnev to Cedric Newbury Casey, a sheep-
grower of Winton.

miss Australia can make rea.l.
c/T LAND, where from the hustling cities Want and
Starvation have forever been banished—where beyond the city
boundaries Industrial Centres, no longer a disfiguring blot on the
landscape, mark happy communities, unhaunted by the ghost of
unemployment—where millions of fertile acres, once a lonely
wilderness, but now settled by prosperous, care-free Australians
produce their myriad fruits of seed and plant to cater for the
needs of a self-contained Nation—the land that Australia could be,
should be, and will be if Australians are true to themselves, and
if Miss Australia in particular will but complete the work she
has begun.
And why should not Miss Australia make this dream come true ?
The Power is hers, that Mighty Power possessed by the Modem
Woman —the control of the Community’s purse-and if Miss
Australia will simply decide to keep Australian-earned money
circulating in Australia per medium of the purchase of Australian-
made commodities on all possible occasions, the larger portion of
the picture drawn above, will be sketched in on the canvas of
the immediate future.
For it is this factor—the direction of Australian-earned money to
the purchase of Australian-made commodities, that, in a few years,
has established “ Bond’s Hosiery" as a mi&hty industry, with its
1200 prosperous Australian employees, and its weekly pay-roll of
£4,000. It is this same factor which will be responsible for the
creation of Bond's fereat Cotton Spinning Mills, the opening of which
at Wentworthville, N.S.W., in a few months’ time, will mark the
enthronement of Kin& Cotton in Australia, to produce and disburse
fresh thousands of pounds per week, and make life a success fo*
yet thousands more Australians. And so the story will &o on
SO eTvtADAM, why not exercise your power as a builder of
your country’s prosperity, as a maker of its history ? You can
be&in so very easily—just by specifying “Bond's" when you next
purchase Hosiery. You’ll find it an immediately profitable pro-
cedure too, for your Silk Hosiery will certainly cost you less
per pair, and less per year, if you wear “Bond’s."

If the Federal people decide to reduce the
high cost of the Jervis Bay Naval College
by allowing sons of the best-gilded to share
the disciplinary training of cadets for a
modest £250 a year, the vice-regal Strad-
brokes’ second hope George will be enrolled
as the first civil “pup.’' George is a cheer-
ful youth who was brought here from Eton
and started his Aussie schooldays at the
Scotch College. He w r as to have gone back
to Eton, but his parents seem to have side-
tracked that intention.
Brighton St. Andrew’s was filled the other
evening to see Evelyn de Courcey Talbot
vow herself away to William Bokemah, of
Sydney, in vellum velvet brocaded with gold
beneath Mrs. Robert May’s famous Limerick
lace veil, which had been lent for the event.
Sister Lucy Talbot and the bridegroom’s
niece Miss Maschwitz combined to wait on
the bride in orchid mauve chiffon A’elvet and
silver-lace hats weighted with coral-pink
feathers. After the knot-tying, Major and
Mrs. de Courcey Talbot —-the latter with
ficelle lace lighting her inky marocain hang-
ings and feathered hat- —entertained at Alton,
their Brighton home. Among the health-
drinkers were Mrs. Frank Grey (Sydney),
who glittered blackly in jetted effects; the
Arthur Payne matron in silky chiffonery,
colored like an Egyptian desert, and a black
hat; her sister Mrs. Miller in jade green
and gold; Uncle John Talbot, Frank and
Jack Grey (from the ’Arbor), some Van
Asches, .Mrs. Reggie Wilmot and Mrs. Phil
Hudson.
“A small edition of the Celia Ghiloni of
my youth,” was a jaded clubman’s comment
on the pink and blonde vision of Evelyn
Scotney at the Town Hall on Saturday,
Plumper than she was last time, the jaunty
little songbird (she had worn orange during
the week) looked radiant in a frock that
twinkled with white beads in the mid fore-
ground, and was flanked by North American
Indian effects of coralesque feather trim-
mings, in harmony with her ostrich feather
fan and pale head-band. Evelyn was ever
festive. She practically introduced short
skirts to the concert platform a few years
ago, but at that time she had a wisp of
chiffon from neck to floor which served for
a train. Perhaps her tendency to stand with
feet rather wude apart, like a fairy warming
herself before a genial fire, is now less pro-
nounced than when she wore a tail. Her
carefully unstudied deportment was at its
best when she faced around and sang to the
choir for an encore. The choir was ready
with a bouquet, presented to the recalled
soloist by a pretty young chorister who was
artistically fated to receive an impulsive
kiss from Madame. The burst of applause
at this endearment was as spontaneous as
the loud huzza from a Parliamentary candi-
date’s entourage when he kisses a baby on
election day.
The Alec ITowitts’ second girleen, Alison,
has just made a confession of intending
matrimony with a young man Albury,
Geoff Smith, whose mother, Mrs. W. Smith,
lives at Mglvern. The golden-haired bride-
elect is a grand-daughter of a late Collins-
street medico (brother of explorer Ilowitt),
whose mother was one of the literary
McCraes.
Press secretary Phil Finkelstein beckoned
Melbourne’s presswoman to meet the Forbes
Robertson lady and daughter, Anne McLean,
at the Oriental the other afternoon. He had
roped in Lilias Waldegrave to help the star
lady feel at home, and H. Lane Bayliff and
Morrison to keep himself in countenance
among the sea of petticoats. Lady Robert-
son chatted gaily in a grey silk crochet cov-
ering with a rose-pink hat and a .fur which’
didn’t look as if she found our sunshine too
strong for her. Daughter Anne, a demure
little damsel, topped navy frockings with an
overshadowing black toque. Lilias M' aide-
grave, whose toque was also ■ inclined, to ex-
tinguish her dimpling smile, had chinchilla
fur wandering down the edges of her grey
silk dress. It was a chatty, cheerful tea-
drinking and Finkelstein tactfully led the
chief guest to th'e other end of the table
half-way through the show so that she might
get acquainted with the company at both
poles.
The dangers of marrying into the British
baronetage were discussed before Chief Jus-
tice Irvine the other day. A 20-year-old
girl sought a short cut to divorce from a
husband who had gone away a fortnight
after marriage (when she was only 16) and
had not since been seen or heard of. The
still-under-age matron was suing through
her mother, a charwoman. It was with his
mother-in-law that the husband had abided
during his fortnight’s honeymoon, and to her
he had written the only letter now produced
in evidence. In this he complained: “I have
been ill with ptomaine poisoning. I think
it was the meat in them sandwiches you
gave me. I am on my uppers.” The rest
of the letter included a reference to “the
old man,” who, it appears, is Sir Hector
McKenzie Meikle, Bart.—about whom the
title-lists are strangely silent. The moral
is, of course, that maidens should beware of
baronets’ sons who eat “them sandwdches.”
His last note on this side of the Divide
has been sung by the Rev. Precentor Kelly,
who until recently did much to keep St.
Paul’s Cathedral music up to the mark.
Beginning at Drysdale more than half-a-
century ago, Kelly climbed up to the job of
vicar at Geelong; then got the precentor-
ship of St. Paul’s, which was quite to his
taste. He had a good life innings, and
reached the three-score-and-ten of the psalm-
ist and the insurance-agent.
Latest letters from Colin Colahan, who
has signed some excellent Bulletin draw-
ings, show that he isn’t finding London
cruel. So far he has been kept fairly busy
doing portrait commissions for people of
social tonnage. May Brahe, who has helped
nearly every successful Australian in Lon-
don, has taken an interest in the young
'painter and secured important commissions
for him. He now dreams of building a
studio in the South of France —but, then,
what artist doesn’t?
The cats are purring about a group of
exclusive females in the Upper Ten who met
surreptitiously in a Toorak drawing-room
lately to receive administration from Hick-
son, some of them having first attended a
swanky tea-party. Is it that the faith-
healees were merely finding a new topic of
conversation for their next tea-fight, or has
Hickson really cast a spell over them? These
dames, by the way, were not the only world-
lings to hold a stealthy meeting with the
layer-on of hands, for several well-known
horse-owners and their wives, with a book-
maker or two thrown in, did it, too. Both
stances were meant to be very private—but
how was it possible to keep so many women’s
mouths hermetically sealed?
Paul Bibron has launched a dance-hall of
his own —a picturesque white bungalow,
touched up with pale green, which has arisen
from the ashes of old Admiralty House in
Collins-place. It got its baptism of jazz
with an invitation jollo last Thursday, when
Madame helped her Paul to see that no one
was out of the fun. The cheery riot ended
up with the dancers tearing down the floor
in the old-time gallop, with Maurice Gut-
teridge’s band in full cry. These inspiring
mid-Victorian measures threaten to outpace
ragtime in the coming by-and.-bye. The
Bibron fortnightly cabarets will now give
place to nightly whirls.
Under the hard line of this trying
bonnet beams the clever, sensitive face
of the late Eloise Juno, known to old-
time theatregoers as a fascinating
leading lady in such parts as Lady
Macbeth, Conc
stance in
“King John,”
Beatrice in
“Much Ado
About No-
thing” and
Desdemona.
Before coming
to Australia,
under George
Coppin’s man-
agement, she
had appeared
with success
with Charles
Kean, Charles
Dillon, Henry
Irving and
J. L. Toole.
In those far-
off, strenuous
days, when
actresses were
not cast from
type, Eloise changed from tragedy to comedy,
from comedy to farce, with equal success.
As the Lady of Lyons she lifted that sug-
ary young snob to classic heights. Other
notables associated with Miss Juno’s early
career were William Creswick, Walter Mont-
gomery and Edgar Bruce. For many years
she taught elocution and stage deportment at
her studio in Scourfield Chambers, Collins-
street; then, time and hard days proving too
strong for her to struggle with, she was
granted the tenancy of one of the Old Colon-
ists’ Homes at Fitzroy. Not unhappy or
neglected here, she was attended till the last
by a devoted companion who, in Eloise’s
head-line days, had been the star’s dresser.
Sam Mackay,. who is putting up a great
fight for health, is doing further time in a
private hospital before his wife carries him
off to Kyneton, where they have acquired
a roomy homestead. Their big white house
out St. Kilda way, which they took over
from Herbert Brookes, was lately placed on
the auction block. It has been snapped up
by a syndicate.
This is John Rowell, who has been attract-
ing some attention wdth the cream of his
oil paintings at the New Art Salon over
in Sydney.
Rowell is on
the staff o f
the Ballarat
Art School,
where he suc-
ceeded Harold
Herbert. His
early bent led
him to the
scene-painters’
frame in Mel-
bourne King’s
Theatre, and
for some years
his time was
divided be-
tween splash-
ing paint on
back- cloths
and things
and his studies
at the Gallery,
where his suc-
cess was
marked. Since then he has made consistent
progress, and his recent shows in Melbourne
have aroused a good deal of interest. Row-
ell’s canvases display the breadth that be-
speaks sincere work.
Somebody’s fond parent recalls to mind
the social competition there was among lion-
hunters for the capture of Sarah Bernhardt
wheh she started her Australian season in
Melbourne. Knowing absolutely nothing of
the city and its society, and being naturally
wary of adventurers who would want to pose
as friends and patrons, Sarah took shelter
behind her ignorance of the language until
she was approached, with a measure of theat-
rical importance, by old George Coppm. The
veteran actor, always a chief shareholder in
the Theatre Royal, was then about to launch
out in management at the old house, after
many years of retirement, and he wrnnted
the kudos of being the first person in Aus-
tralia to entertain the great French actress
en famille. He secured her for a Sunday-
night conversazione at his house in East Mel-
bourne, and cards were sent out. It
was what newspaper men call a scoop. A
vast armchair on a dais had been placed for
Sarah in the Coppins’ best parlor, and there
she was begged to display herself as soon
as she arrived with her young friend Mon-
sieur Darmong, and two or three other the-
atrical aides. At first the lady jibbed at the
notion of playing the queen in conventional
manner, but later in the evening she moved
into the throne and appeared to enjoy the
homage of the company while presentations
were made by artist George Ashton, a
son-in-law of the host. The distinguished
visitor had been primed with the names of
two or three wealthy citizens who might be
worth something to her in the way of enter-
tainment, and Baronet William Clarke, father
of S’Rupert, must have been one of them,
for when the master of ceremonies intro-
duced Hamilton Clarke, the musician (then
in Melbourne as conductor of the State
orchestra), Sarah hastily inquired in a whis-
per whether the gentleman was “Sir” Clarke.
“As sharp as a needle when she chose,”
remarked the matron who helped to meet
her at the Coppin domicile long ago.
Having survived her husband by nearly 13
years, Mrs. James Styles has now followed
him to the grave. She was a link with the
days when railways were built by her James,
who earned fame as well as fortune. The
fame was sufficient, at any rate, to send him,
first, into the Vic. Assembly as member for
Williamstown, and then into the Senate as a
sturdy Protectionist. Mrs. Styles’s father,
Pat Cosgrove, was one of the pioneer pasto-
ralists of the Caboolture district (Q.). A
son and a married daughter were the chief
mourners.
Wellington (M.L.) is lamenting the flight
of three of its songbirds to London—-Teresa
McEnroe, Mabelle Esquilant and Eileen Dris-
coll. Miss Driscoll has specialised in Alfred
Hill’s Maori songs, and her singing of
“Waiata Maori” has made more than one
Maori’s eyes flash. Constance Leatham, of
New Plymouth, who has been making some-
thing of a name for herself as a pianist, is
another departer; also Ernest Anderson and
his wife, both amateur musicians. All but
Teresa McEnroe go Londonwards in the
Corinthic. Even the ship’s cat ought to be-
come a notable singer with such a galaxy
of musicians aboard.
The Steve Baileys brought daughter Lass
(officially Elsie) from their western acreage,
Tarrinallum, to hand her over to Don Payne
at the Melbourne Grammar Chapel the
other evening. The bridal wrappings of
white satin, roped with pearls and a dash
of orange blossoms, was backed by a fall of
pink chiffon which blushed timidly through
old Limerick lace. A tulle veil fluttered
from an anchorage of silver ribbon and
orange flowers. Little June Bailey, who
held cousin Lass’s lace tail, was in yellow,
with flowers wreathing her head and waist.
Madge Rymill, from Adelaide, and Doris
Neighbour bridesm aided pleasingly in nas-
turtium velvet, with their heads in a tangle
of wreaths, veils and mob caps of the same
color. 11. Bailey looked after the bride-
groom, with the assistance of A. Mcßean,
A. Sinclair and A. Wilson. The Baileys
had hired No. 9 Darling-street for the fol-
lowing bean-o —at which Agar Wynne was
chief orator —and the spree ended up as a
one-step.
Mrs. Mary Ann Knight, of Ballarat, has
just passed her 102nd milestone. She was
born at Dover (Eng.), was one of the first
women to reach the diggings in _ 1852, and
has lived in the district ever since. The
old lady has 50 descendants, running into
the fifth generation.
Another Aussie family was linked up with
royalty when Dorothy Hastings vowed her-
self away to Queen Mary’s nephew, the Earl
of Eltham, son and heir of the Duke of
Cambridge, in London a day or two ago.
Bride Dorothy’s sister married the Fred Fair-
bairns’ good-looking son Gordon (better
known to his pals as Beau), when the
young man was in khaki. That pair are now
browsing on a sheep acreage at Seymour with
their Victorian-born babes and a Hastings
sister, who came on a visit early last year.
By the way, the mother of the Earl of Hunt-
ingdon, the present head of the Hastings
family, was a daughter of the late Samuel
Wilson, of Ballarat.
During Ilealer Hickson’s visit to Hobart
at least one person benefited by the laying
on of hands. At a Thanksgiving service
held at St. David’s Cathedral, for benefits
conferred by the mission, this individual
practised upon a lady without her knowledge
and relieved her of a gold watch and chain
valued at £25. In reporting her loss she
didn’t display any more spiritual uplift tiffin
you’d expect.
The Berry-street Foundling Hospital’s
S.O.S. call is being answered by the Women’s
Automobile Club. They hope to send along
a cheque for £420 as a result of the card-
party and caf6 chantant at the Oriental
Hotel which the ever-generous Miss Macßa6
has placed at the' service of the cause on
April 24, together with a cheque for £2O.
At the Ambulance Guild meeting last
week it was decided to carry on with the
annual ball in the St. Kilda Town Hall.
This whirl will help to wipe out the £3450
debt which weighs down the new building.
Naval Commander Hyde’s wife will take
charge of the tickets, General White will
hold the purse-strings, and Gertrude Rennie
will handle the pen. The date is July 13.
Some gossip from Adelaide: —
What with his own golden wedding and a civic
banquet to the Governor, last week was a busy one
for little Mayor Cohen. At the former shivoo there
were 35 representatives of the Cohen clan and city
councillors galore as guests; but the other was a
much larger affair. Two hundred and sixty “covers,”
so please you, and a list of acceptances that included
Lady Bridges as well as his Ex., the Chief Justice
and Miss Murray, Barwells, Butlers, Brookmans,
Symons, Mouldens, Pooles and everyone else who
counts for anything in the official world. There were
speeches at both, of course, and at the wedding
feast presentations of golden bowls, knife rests,
iluminated addresses, gold-mounted umbrellas and
the Lord knows what besides.
Incidentally, the popular little man, who got our
common or garden mayor turned into a lord, has
now had the vexed question of his precedence Settled.
In his own city he is to come next to the Governor,
and ahead of all Premiers, members of the Min-
istry, Lieut.-Governors, Judges, bottle-ohs, book-
makers, etc. So that’s that. But Mayor Cohen isn’t
going to claim the newly-exalted position for himself.
Clifford Lathlean, here on a brief visit from Syd-
ney, found a crowded Town Hall awaiting him at
his concert. The only other performers were his
mother, who taught him his first music and accom-
panied him delightfully, and popular Maude Puddy.
The masses of flowers handed up included a laurel
wreath for the star performer. Lady Bridges and
small daughter Alvida were part of the audience.
Delegates bound for the Women’s Suffrage Congress
in Rome are keeping the Women’s Non-Party Asso-
ciation busy, and there is a continual chink of tea-
cups in the rooms. The Eastern States envoys were
entertained last week —Mrs. Jamieson Williams and
Mrs. Bennett, from N. S. Wales, and Dr. Ethel
Morris, from Melbourne.
Professor Darnley Naylor’s tall daughter was the
speaker at the last meeting of the Alliance Fran-
caise. She talked about the League of Nations, and
backed up her remarks with some lantern slides.
The Alliance, which has bagged Lady Bridges as its
patron, has now shaken itself very wide awake and
plans an extra-busy season—frequent meetings of
the more Sternly educative variety and a “social
soirSe” every month.
The Governor had barely got back front his visit
to Sydney when he went a-tripping to Kangaroo
Island —his guides Premier Barwell and Captain
White, and his chariot the motor that headed the
White-MacCallum overland expedition. They went
from Kingscote right round the island —the first time
a motor has done the trip—with two nights on the
way, one at the Cape Borda lighthouse and the other
at Rocky River, where they had a wallaby hunt at
night with searchlights. His Ex. got a cordial wel-
come from everybody, bar the wallabies.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
The City Tattersall’s meeting, which fol-
lows the Doncaster Handicap-Sydney Cup round at
Randwick, is a great institution for the man behind
the bag. Last year the success of three rank out-
siders enabled the philanthropist who never wins to
“break even on the day,” and on Saturday the lowest-
priced winner was “Lucky” Bailie’s Elkin, 10 to 1.
The others were Sentinel and Monopole, at 12’s;
John Shell, Airbird and King of the Forest, at
20’s. It is many a day since the public was skinned
so effectually. The only drop of vinegar in Rook’s
cup of nectar was that nearly all the Melbourne
punters who did so well at the Easter carnival, and
played up their winnings at the yearling sales, had
gone home.
A faithful old slave is King of the Forest, who
won the City Tattersall’s Cup for Munson after his
owner had vainly sent him into the auction-yard
(Bailie had the same experience with Elkin —such
is the luck of the game). He had run a good
second to King’s Battery on the third day at Rand-
wick, but shaped poorly in Mufti’s Dangar Handicap.
With a change of jockeys and a field of mostly
jaded horses to beat, he had the race won a furlong
from home. When Bailie added him to his collection the
Randwick trainers regarded it as the joke of the
season, for the horse had a pronounced defect. But
the old fellow got rid of it under his owner’s un-
orthodox system of training—he believes in giving
his horses plenty of work and turning them out,
rugged, of nights—and proved to have no superior
as a stayer among the second-raters racing about
Sydney. And Munson is finding him as profitable
as Bailie did.
Purser’s brother, Sea Risk, is taking a long time
to come good, A slow beginner, he is rather awk-
ward in a big field, and it has been his bad luck in
all his races this season to have to fight his way
through a crowd. However, thousands of people
left Randwick on Saturday convinced that he was
first home in the mile Welter, in which he was
placed third to Monopole and Stony. The three
finished almost in a line, and perhaps the judge
was right, but since he shares the fallibility of the
human family it is quite possible that the wrath
of Sea; Risk’s supporters was justified. They do these
things better at Port Adelaide. There, on March
17, the European method of cinematographing fin-
ishes was adopted, with results so impressive that
the club chairman said after the meeting, “It has
been a perfect success.” Seven races were held,
and in each case the photographer had his film
developed within two minutes; moreover, he is con-
fident he can improve on that time. They are
already talking in Adelaide of employing camera-
men to do the work now performed, more or less
unsatisfactorily, by stipendiary stewards, otherwise
the Three Blind Mice. Anyhow, the A.J.C. should
certainly give the Port Adelaide experiment a trial.
* * * *
The Sydney clubs are getting a rotten
return for the rich prizes they are hanging up for
races over the jumps. In the A.J.C. Second Steeple-
chase, worth £ 555 to the winner, only two of the
eight starters —all Ma Staters except the topweight,
Oopina—completed the course, and the second horse,
Almond, staggered home 350 yards behind Oopina.
And of the 10 competitors in the Hurdles at the
City Tattersall’s meeting two failed to finish and six
came in damaged and had to be attended by the
vet. A large proportion of the alleged jumpers
dodging the Zoo in Sydney don’t get half enough
schooling. And there is a lingering suspicion that
some of the brutes are unsound.
* * * #
“0.K.”: Whether the in-and-out running
that so many punters suffer from be due to unskilful
training, loose jocke.vship, faults of equine tempera-
ment or what not, the consistency of a Carbine or
a Eurythmie makes it hard to explain. Sometimes
excuses are made for the culprits, and sometimes
their failures are explainable only by the word “cow.”
Perhaps that covers a lot of the difference between
their fleeting brilliancy and the steady beam of a
champion. The bottom may have been knocked out
of the argument that Eurythmie was another Carbine,
but Eurythmie, in the waning of his star, has at
least been a bright example of consistency in com-
parison with his leading contemporaries, with the
exception of David. The son of Eudorus didn’t keep
on winning, but he continued to have a mighty good
go for it, whilst his w.f.a. conquerors were dimming
their triumphs with some darned bad goes. It was
in consistency that Eurythmie rivalled Carbine's
record.
Comedy King has had few better advertise-
ments than Luteplayer, now retired from business.
Luteplayer’s legs carried him through more than
100 races, and earned for his owner more than
£BOOO in stakes, the result mostly of his middle-
distance merits. His own pacemaker, as a rule, he
could stay up to 12 furlongs in decent company,
and was often top of the second class at his favorite
distance —11 furlongs. The aged gelding is to pass
his declining days in clover.
* * * #
King Ingoda, who was coming on at the
end of the A. J.C. meeting, has been allotted 9st. 71b.
in the 13-furlong Adelaide Cup. He was fourth last
year with 7st. 121 b. Jolly Cosy has been given
Bst. 111 b. on her Westralian form at Christmas.
Crusader, third last year with Bst. 31b., has half a
stone more this time, and Shillinglee’s third in the
Sydney Cup, after leading most of the way, makes
his Bst. 61b. look a moderate burden. But he may
be kept for the Melbourne Cup. Far away down the
list are Socratea, second last year, 7st., and Binbi,
the Hobart Cup winner, 7st. 51b. In the S.A. Jockey
Club’s other big event, the six-furlong Goodwood
Handicap, last year’s winner, St. Speed, is bracketed
at 9st. 101 b. (81b. more than he carried then), with
Prince Tressady. Jolly Cosy and Denacre are next,
at 9st. 31b., and Disnavane looks well in with lib.
less.
* * * *
A new story of the long-ago English
jockey Fred Archer is told in a recent book by
Percy F. Thorn on “Humane Horse Training.” On
a visit to New York in search of health, Archer
asked John Splan, a leading owner of trotters, what
were the “principal fixed events” in the turf calendar
of the U.S.A. The cheerful reply was: “Between you
and me, Fred, they are nearly all fixed.” And the
bystanders, with the usual American contempt for
the British sense of humor, “offered to bet a bottle
and a bird against a glass of cold water that Archer
would die without ever knowing what Splan meant.”
* * * *
“Alex Val”: The notion that one can
gamble with impunity on anything within the pre-
cincts of a racecourse dies hard. At Ascot (Q.), a
youth was filling in the long luncheon interval with
a little game of “traybit peter,” when a bluecoated
spoil-sport gathered him in. Fined £5. On the same
day a horse won a race easily against practically
the same field as that in which, only two days before,
it had finished a long last. But horse-gambling is
respectable; “peter” disreputable.
* * * *
“H.K.” : The banning of Boccaccio’s work
by the Customs Department recalls the Sydney
bookmaker who confided to a brother Rook that
he had just finished reading “a real snifter book."
“I picked it up in Castlereagh-street,” he continued.
“The hottest lotter yarns 1 ever read. And the
funny part is they were all wrote by a Scotch
bloke named De Cameron.”
Notwithstanding the absence of J. O.
Anderson and Norman Peach, the N.S.W. tennis
team carried too many guns for the Maorilanders at
Sydney last week. M.L. won the singles by 7 matches
to 5, but in the doubles the Ma Staters routed them
by 8 matches to 1. J. Clemenger’s showing was
uncommonly good. In the singles he defeated both
the M.L. cracks —Ollivier by 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, and Sims
by 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. He is distinctly a Davis Cup
possibility. Aubrey Sieler did well to beat A. W.
Sims in straight sets (6-2, 6-3), but Ollivier settled
his hash (6-2, 11-9). Veteran J. C. Peacock (M.L.)
made light of his 50 years in winning his matches
against H. W. Kirkpatrick and L. Baker. He was
M.L. singles champion ’way back in 1901 and
again in 1910 ; and five times took the doubles —with
11. A. Parker in 1900 and F. M. Fisher, now in
England, in 1901, 1902, 1909 and 1910. D. G.
France and Sims credited the Dominion with its
only success in the doubles. But Sims’s form was
conspicuously inferior to what he showed when he
arrived in Sydney.
•» * • *
“15-30”: Norman Brookes ought to per-
suade himself to take a place in the Davis Cup
team which, I hope, will shortly buy tickets for
America. The other day the veteran had three sets
with young Schlesinger, and the trouncing he gave
the youth showed how superior placing and court-
craft can make a first-class player look like a ninny.
To my mind Brookes is still formidable, and could
he be advised to assume command of our crowd and
give Anderson or Hawlces the benefit of his assist-
ance on the doubles court, he would make some stir
in the tennis world. The moral effect would also
be considerable, for, if there is a name to inspire
respect, even among international stars, it is that of
Norman Brookes. Tilden has openly confessed that
the imperturbable face under the old golf-cap : has
worried him more than any other countenance he
has studied inside the white oblong. No doubt
Tilden could beat the veteran now by sheer stamina
—if a match were brought to that—but, all the
same, he would prefer to be up against Patterson, if
Brookes had had sufficient practice to recover some
of his old mastery over the ball. I have seen Tilden,
Johnston, Kingscote, Lycett, Beamish, Parke, Dixon
and all the big fellows who have appeared here in
recent years, and not one of them was ever so remark-
able as Brookes. He stands alone—a consummate
juggler among men who owe their victories to all-
round but unimaginative accuracy, as in the case of
Tilden, or to some specialised stroke, such as the
running drive of Parke, which, incidentally, knocked
out Brookes in the Davis Cup final of 1912.
# * * *
“P. Doody”: At a Bendigo tennis tourna-
ment the other day one Merrie was drawn to play
Bright. The umpire was named Jolly.
“Linesman”: In an exhibition tennis
match against Patterson and O’Hara Wood at Bal-
larat, Hawkes and Wertheim showed some of the
form that nearly won them the Vic. doubles cham-
pionship from Brookes and Patterson two or three
years ago. On that occasion Wertheim and Hawkes
overwhelmed the internationals in the first two sets
by brilliant close-net play, but dropped the next
three through Wertheim’s errors at crucial moments.
On Saturday, however, they were up to concert-pitch
all through, and romped home by three sets to one.
Wertheim, who occasionally has a day out, played like
a wizard, and easily dominated the court, whereas
Patterson, who had previously knocked out Hawkes
in a singles rally by two sets to love, was rather
slack in his assistance to his hard-working partner.
Wertheim seems to produce his best tennis when part-
nered with the Geelong youth.
* * * *
A great bowling performance was that of
H. Comber for Waverley v. Gordon. Pitching ’em
well up and turning the ball both ways, Comber col-
lected 7 for 19 off 95 deliveries, and practically won
the Sydney premiership for his side, who were on
top last year. His bag for the season is 43 wickets,
averaging 15.46. But the selectors don’t reckon him
good enough for the State eleven. Gordon crashed
for 72 (R. C. M. Boyce, 30, and Macartney, 14), and
Waverley had lost 5 for 43 when E. B. Forssberg
(19) and Savage (18 not out) saved the side. With
8 down for 95 they have the match in their keeping.
Macartney took 6 for 27. Eight thousand people
saw 18 wickets fall for 167 runs on a wicket that
wasn’t particularly bad. Apparently the art of play-
ing forcing cricket on damaged pitches died with
Victor Trumper and Harry Graham.
* * * *
B. M. Salmon, captain of C. of E. Gram-
mar, is the most promising youth in Sydney G. P.
Schools cricket. A left-hander, with a Bardsley-like
defence, he made 225 against Newington and 120 v.
Scots. The young fellow is a good change bowler,
and is no slouch at football or with the gloves.
The promise of a ding-dong go for the
Melbourne cricket premiership was dissipated soon
after P’ran and North resumed their argument on
Saturday. P’ran’s two not-outs, Healy and Ste-
phens, carried their own totals to 127 and 71, but
the others did nothing, and the whole side went for
259. After the departure of Stephens, when the
board read 5 for 227, 4 wickets fell for 5 in
THE REAL TERROR.
TUTOR: “Yer don't wahter worry ’bout stop-
pin’ a few punches. Yer won well.”
BATTERED AMATEUR : “Yes; hut my girl might
think I’ve been fighting.”
almost as many minutes, Matthews just missing the
hat-trick. He finished with the good average of 5
for 87. North failed by 115, P’ran thus taking the
championship for the third year in succession, and
getting permanent ownership of the Victory Cup.
Wallace got 4 for 67, and Grimmett 5 for 65.
“Tren”: Gerald Healy, who top-scored for P’ran,
did the same thing in last year’s final against Col-
lingwood, when he made 230. He has been with
the club since 1906, and has won the batting average
on 10 occasions. Before the district scheme he
played for East Melbourne, and about 16 years ago
won their batting average against such "giants as
Peter McAlister, Frank Laver, Sam McMichael and
Arthur Christian. Though against Tasmania he
once made 218, his inter-State appearances have been
few, but this cannot be put down to official preju-
dice, for his father, John Healy, was for some years
secretary to the Victorian Cricket Association. Stan
Stephens was an inter-State player before the war,
and in 1914, against poor old Tassie, achieved the
batsman’s double with 108 and 181. He is still
the best and most daring fieldsman in Victoria.
Prahran are a wonderful team if they get into the
finals. On eight occasions they have reached the
first four; they have never lost a semi, and have
only once been beaten in a final. That was in 1915.
* * * *
“Trekle”: Two footballers’ cricket teams
did well in Victoria this year. South Melbourne won
the first-grade junior competition from Brunswick
City, and Melbourne went undefeated through the
first grade of the metropolitan League. The
Southerners are footballers only in name, for not
one of them nowadays strips for the “Blood-Stained
Angels,” though Bert Franks, a versatile cricketer,
was a champion in every department of the winter
game 15 years ago. The Melbourne XI, however,
are recruited from the League football team, and
were altogether too classy for all their opponents.
Their best men are Charlie Lillev, an all-rounder,
who was a Victorian cricket colt and also centre in
the State football team the year war broke out; and
Bill Allen, late of East Melbourne, who has repre-
sented the State as a fast bowler in summer and as
a ruck man in winter. Bert Chadwick, the cham-
pion centre half-back, ’keeps splendidly; Harry Coy,
the full-back, is, after Lilley, the most consistent
batsman: and Johnny Lord, the follower, is a very
successful medium-paced bowler. Anthony, Peck,
Wilson and Elliman are other football stars of this
versatile eleven.
*** * .
“H.K.”: By capturing all 10 wickets twice
running for 65 runs, L. Benaud (B. 12/4/’23) did
not lower Cyril Bashford’s figures. Playing in
a church competition at Coburg (Vic.), in 1905,
Bashford dismissed the opposition for 9 in the first
inning's and 20 in the second.
• * * *
“Jim M.” : Frank Tarrant’s return to Mel-
bourne recalls his swift rise to fame in the cricket
world. As a ground bowler at the M.C.C. he so
impressed “Plum” Warner on his first tour that
Warner persuaded the young Victorian to go to
England and qualify for Middlesex. In a few years
time Tarrant was second only to Rhodes as Eng-
land’s best all-rounder. For several seasons he got
the coveted double (1000 runs and 100 wickets). In
1907 he came back and played for Victoria in inter-
state matches, and his score of 206 stands as a
record for a Victorian against N.S.W. On the
termination of his contract with Middlesex, Tarrant
went to India, where he acted as coach and player
for a few seasons. Later he became interested in
horse-breeding and. racing, and retired from cricket
altogether. Business connected with his new profession
has brought him back.
* * * «
“Matahari”: The retirement of Frank
Glebe heavyweight, has robbed the
N.S.W. Rugby League of its greatest forward. Burge
has pulled on a jersey against England, M.L., the Maoris
and Queensland. He visited England in 1921-22 and
amazed the Lancashiremen with his unique combina-
tion of strength and speed. But, like other League
cracks, Burge has been roughly handled. After one
match last year he was removed from the ground in
a horizontal position and the doctor said “Con-
cussion.” Frank is one of four brothers (Peter,
“Son” and Laidley are the others), all good foot-
ballers. _ Peter was a member of the 1908 Wallabies.
“Leagueite”: I never saw a finer Rugby forward
than Frank Burge, who has retired at 26. During
his career as a senior ’bailer (he was playing senior
grade at 14) he scored nearly 1000 points. In the
23 matches he played in England, 33 tries 5 goals
(109 points) went down to his credit. As active
as a cat despite his 14 stone, he not only dazzled
the English Rugby people but was offered a four-
figure inducement to sign up with one of the Soccer
clubs. But the big Australian decided that Australia
was good enough for him.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Johnny Taylor, the A.I.F.
and Australian XI cricketer and, last year, a N.S.W.
Rugby Union rep. against the Maoris,' has gone out
of active football. He is now appearing in a new
rSle, that of organiser for the Sports Union of Syd-
ney ’Varsity, of which he is a member. University
sport needs all the help Taylor can give it. It has
been suffering from sleeping sickness for ages.
* * * #
“Ongo”: A. S. B. Walker, who led the
N.S.W. XV which won the rubber last year from
Maoriland—the first time it has happened since
Teddy Raper took a team across the water in 1882
—will look on this season. Walker, who is 30,
has played _ senior Rugby since 1912, when he
toured America with a N.S.W. combination. Since
then he has figured against Bananaland, Maoriland,
the Springboks and the A.I.F. team. Last week
the Rugby Union presented him with an honor-cap
in recognition of his services to the game. “Wakka's”
grandad, Thomas Playfair, was Mayor of Sydney
when black beards were de rigger.
* * * *
“Wilfrido”: Although Rugby may still be
looked upon as M.L.’s national sport, Soccer is ob-
taining a firm hold in some centres. In Wellington
alone there were 112 teams last year, and at the
second match with the N. S. Wales side the attend-
ance was 11,000. Still, one recollects that when the
AH Blacks met the Springboks for the last time
30,000 enthusiasts watched the argument for hours
on the wettest, coldest day ever felt in the Windy
City.
# * * #
“Centurion”: Not long ago the sporting
body I am most interested in, the Antarctic Marbles
Association, lost control of an important local arena ;
it was granted, at an increased rent, to an organisa-
tion playing a rival code of marbles. Meeting a promi-
nent supporter of the original Marblers, I condoled
with him, and hinted that if he had had anything to do
with the business there would have been no catas-
trophe. “Bli’ me, no!” he said, in broken accents,
“Wot was they doin’ that they didn’ go to one or
two of th’ aldermen with a tenner ’ere and a tenner
there, an’ a bit more w’ere it’d do good:? Of all th’
dopey cows Aw, w’at’s th’ use?”
* * * *
After toying with a shovel for a couple
of seasons Digger Evans (Bst. 1111 b.) came back into
the boxing game by outpointing Jimmy Ryan
(9at. 011 b.) at the Sydney Stadium. Too fast for
Ryan, a tall, gracefully-built youngster, the grinning
warrior was doing something all the time. He is a
pocket-edition of Kay, but his methods are more
entertaining than those of the satairnine Westralian.
When half-pushed and half-punched to the canvas in
the 14th round his flip-flap was a work of art. Un-
fortunately he gave no sign, during his interesting
60-minutes turn, of having discovered a punch.
“Push Off”: I class Charles Stuart, the
16-year-old “Shore” boy, as the fastest sprint-
swimmer of his years N.S.W. has, ever produced.
Champion of the Northern Suburbs over 50yds. and
100yds., he has covered the 50 in 25sec., the
100 in 58 4-ssec., and the furlong in 2min.
40 l-ssec. His time for 50yds. is only 1 2-ssec.
worse than Alick Wickham’s State record. A splen-
didly-built youngster, Stuart will be knocking at
the door when the Olympic team is selected next
summer.
* * * *
Tasmania will have a worthy rep. when
N. Hutton strips at the Gothenburg Games. At
North Hobart, on Saturday, Hutton won the 220yds.
State title in 22 3-ssec., and filled second place in
the 100yds. (10 2-ssec.) and the 440yds. (51sec.).
Equally impressive were the performances of A.
Leitch, who took the 440yds. the 880yds (2min.
2 2-ssec.) and was second in the 220yds. Leitch
is locally regarded as one of the best middle-distance
peds. the Speck has known for many years.
* * * a
A fine race is promised when S. McGorm
(Vic.) and A. G. Bull (N.S.W.) meet for the Aus-
tralian amateur sculling championship at Perth.
McGorm (Sandhurst) won the Vic. title by four
lengths from J. Barton (Richmond) and J. C. Hardv
(Footscray), covering 3 miles in 20min. 6 l-6sec.
Bull (Leichhardt) took N.S.W. honors by eight
lengths from R. Neilson (Balmain) and others over 3
miles 160yds. in 23min. 21sec. ; and he is Austra-
lian champion as well. With Arthur Baynes, the
Queenslander, in temporary retirement, the pair look
like fighting out the finish on the Swan River.
THE SPORT OF ANCIENTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(The jazzing season begins officially in May.)
“Get out your granny’s evening shoes and clean her
white kid gloves”
(Thus filial Bligson to his daughter Jane).
“The season for the sport that dear old grandmamma
best loves
I’m pleased to note is with us once again.
Rheumatics bar her from the courts; at golf she
has no chance;
But, thank the Lord, while jazzing lasts, she anyhow
can dance.
“Remove the moth-ball from the folds of grandpapa’s
dress suit;
It soon will know another kind of ball,
Likewise another kind of moth as, dreamy-eyed and
mute,
He shuffles with some flapper round a hall.
They’re jazzing now at ninety-odd, and he’s but
eighty-two.
For years to come he’ll take the floor as merrily as
you.
“Some pastimes are abandoned at a very early age.
It’s decades since I owned a box of bricks ;
The marbles of my boyhood went, and, at another
stage,
The games I played with balls and bats and sticks.
But jazzing is like vintage wine: its flavor grows
with age.
Grave oldsters play at it until they jazz clean off
life’s stage.”
N.S.W.

“The Rumpus”: Charged at Perth with
having left his wife without means of sup-
port in Sydney, Thomas Leslie Russell, a
returned soldier, pleaded that the lady had
repeatedly reproached him for not having
been shot at the Front. Whereupon, no
doubt, he mused :
Oh, Macker.sen and Liman Sanders,
Old Hindy and Von Kluck,
When bullets flew on redden’d Flanders
Why did I ever duck?
Oh, Kaiser Bill, in your ambition,
Was ever yours the guess
That I’d be blamed for your omission
To make of me one less?
“The Deacon”: Tot homines, tot senten-
tial, in Macquarie-street. A man went there
with polypi. A big gun of the profession
said, “Three weeks in hospital at £7 7s.
per week, plus £63 operating fee, plus the
anaesthetist’s fee, plus extras.” A door or
two up the street the man consulted another
Galen, who cut out the four polypi in live
minutes—the only extra was £2 2s. for the
attendant. And as against the first shark’s
order of a three weeks’ lay-by, this one sug-
gested going easy that afternoon !
“Flicker” on a Romanish Jew :
Spc-aking of the religion that Disraeli died in (B.
29/3/’2B). Even if he did send for a priest, his
last words pronounced him a Jew. Geo. W. E.
Russell, in his “A Pocketful of Sixpences,” says:
“....and as the darkness gathered and the silence
deepened, the watchers caught the sound of the
dying Israelite’s confession of fundamental faith,
‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One God,’ ” By
the way, Zangwill, in his “King of Sehnorrers,”
ascribes the Jewish communion’s loss of Dizzy to
a fine imposed by the council of a London Synagogue.
He says, “A fine of £4O drove from the Synagogue
Israel Disraeli, the author of ‘Curiosities of Litera-
ture,’ and made possible that curiosity of politics,
the career of Lord Beaconsfield.”
“Werrimee”: Blinker was a fussy and
portly little man, with a haughty, important
air about him. His special grievance was
homeless cows of nocturnal habits, and he
had complained repeatedly to the local town
council about “livestock roosting on the foot-
paths.” The climax was reached when he
fell over a recumbent beast in the dark and
broke a bottle of something he wasn’t sup-
posed to be carrying home at that hour.
Straight away he went in wrath to the
pound-keeper, and demanded that the offend-
ing quadruped be immediately interned.
The pound-keeper obliged; and next morn-
ing the street was one long avenue of merri-
ment. The cow belonged to the gentleman
who fell over her. Some stray owner, an-
noyed at Blinker’s complainings, had let her
out.
“Harold Hardupp”: A woman of 27 with
SO convictions to her discredit, or to the dis-
credit of a futile law, was put away the
other day for another month, on a charge of
vagrancy. Apparently the Law’s only idea
on the subject is to shove such a girl out of
sight for a spell, and then release her, with
very little money to keep “straight” upon,
and her old frailty uncorrected. The sensible
idea would be to regard her as one suffering
from a malady which required cure in her
own interest and the interest of the com-
munity ; to regard her, also, as a convalescent
who wanted careful watching on her release.
Of course, this young woman’s 80 convic-
tions are not a record. An Adelaide man
had 418. Still, give her and the law time—•
she’s only 27.
“T. 0.1.”: The letting of a contract for
the erection of office premises for the Bank
of N. S. Wales in old Macquarie-place,
Sydney, recalls that the site was occupied
as far back as 1805 by the fine residence of
Simeon Lord, merchant. who had stores ad-
joining. In 1817 the Bank of N. S. Wales
w r as founded, and its first office was in Mac-
quarie-place, in a building owned by Mrs.
Reiby, on a site now covered by Bird’s
warehouse. Preliminary meetings to estab-
lish the bank are said to have been held in
Lord’s house. In the late ’thirties the Lord
mansion became a swell boarding-house kept
by a Mrs. Butler; then it was the Star
Hotel, then a branch of the Lands Depart-
ment, afterwards just “offices,” and in 1908
came demolition.
The Irish Free State has received claims
amounting to £10,750,000 for house-burnings,
a class of catastrophe which its troops are
hardly ever in time to avert, though the army
costs about £11,000,000 a year. Internal
revenue is as hard to collect as steak from
the mouth of a famished lion, but the new
tariff should begin to bring in revenue, if
there is any money with which to pay for
imports, and if it is possible to collect at
places like Cork, w T hich is no-man’s land.
The irrepressible Mary McSwiney has taken
to issuing proclamations to add to the con-
fusion, the gist of them being that every-
body is free to think the way Mary thinks,
that everybody has full liberty to do what
Mary tells him, and that everybody is equal,
especially Mary. One way and another it
doesn’t look as though the Free State Gov-
ernment was making much headway.
“Tauwarra” discerns a new craft: —■
A Capt. T. W. H. Sarll, according to a London
daily, promises something new in the field of Papuan
exploration. His idea is to equip an expedition,
having for its objects the making of a geographical
film of the world for educational use, the establish-
ment of trading stations and eocoanut plantations
in the Pacific, and the general development of British
trade in the South Seas. Sarll is a versatile lad
who has been, in turn, explorer, war correspondent,
film expert, cowboy, seaman, soldier, cattleman and
J. Hop. Papua will be included in the party’s itiner-
ary, and an attempt will be made to discover the
source of the Fly River, where the leader “happens
to know of some rich gold deposits.” This will be
good news to the survivors of Papua’s Old Brigade—
for years past they have been in the unhappy posi-
tion of the historic islanders who earned a pre-
carious livelihood by taking in each other’s washing,
A few talented ladies will add tone to the expedi-
tion. In the mornings, one conjectures, they will be
expected to act in a film; in the afternoons they
may be mannequins or saleswomen; and in the
evenings take a song-and-dance turn at a musical
show. When Sarll’s menagerie gets into its stride
I prophesy a severe slump in Frank Hurley’s stock
amongst that genial explorer’s head-hunting friends
on the banks of Lake Murray.

Jean Gerardy! The name, melodious as
a long-drawn note of his own ’cello, drew a
packed house at the Town Hall on Saturday,
and the Sydney that heard him nearly a
quarter-of-a-century ago found in Ins art
everything it had found then, with the mel-
lowing of the years to make the tone more
golden. When he played the 1 upper
number the listener was in a sunlit walled
garden, murmurous with bees, fragrant of
honey-full flowers. There were peaches ripen-
ing against the wall, and in the shadowy
distance there was the tinkle of a playing
fountain. Boellmann’s Symphonic Variations
was the big opening work, and Gerardy made
of it a thing of exquisite melody and tender-
ness. Pianist George Stewart McManus sup-
plied the accompaniment to this number with
true artistry. Responding to applause, the
magic bow invoked the St. Saens “Romance
from his £lO,OOO Stradivarius. The Bocch-
erini Sonata was a triumph of singing grace
and butterfly delicacy. To the Popper
piece first mentioned, the ’cellist added
Pergolesi’s “Tre Giorni,” which proved as
great a favorite on Saturday as it was with
the audiences of 20 years ago. There was
a Bach aria and a Schumann number,
and when it seemed that no devotee s ear
or heart could hold further glory of melody
without splitting, the ’cellist came back, and
in company with the pianist placed our non-
descript National Anthem in a shrine of un-
dreamed-of spirituality. A special word goes
to pianist McManus for his rendering of
the Brahms numbers and the Schumann en-
core. Sydney girl Essie Ackland added her
beautiful contralto notes to. the . evening’s
music, and won her artistic triumph in
Tschaikowsky’s “None but the Lonely
Heart,” though the heavyweight Caro Mio
Ben” had earlier brought a hailstorm of ap-
plause around her pretty head.

It was a substantial insult that Sydney
Repertory Society handed to Gregan
McMahon last week, after the benefit per-
formance at the Conservatorium Hall, but
McMahon deserved every bit of it. As actor
and producer he has given Sydney of his
best, and McMahon’s best is very good in-
deed. If the Society pleads . guilty, with
unblushing impenitence, to being an estab-
lished and increasingly prosperous concern,
on Gregan’s head lies most of the blame. On
Saturday and Monday the beneficiare was

he was helped by
Beatrice Tildesley
as the flower-girl,
Eugenie Moreau as
Anne Wellwyn,
and Vincent Doyle
as the cabby with
a chronic thirst.
But the perform-
ance was unre-
markable. “Can-
dida,” with Mrs.
Heath Green in
the name-part,
McMahon as her
father, Herbert
Millard as her
husband, Doris
Fi 11 o n as the
typist, Kenneth
Webb as the
curate, and Fred-
erick Hughes as
the poet-lover, was
more interestingly
done. Mrs. Green
was a very suc-
cessful Candida,
and McMahon’s
own work and that
of Herbert Mil-
lard were quite in
the Shavian spirit.
But the poet is an
impossible crea-
ture, and Fred-
erick Hughes con-
trived to make him unpleasant as well.

Nothing has happened to “Sally,” at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, since last report, and no-
thing is likely to happen until boat-race night,
May 5, when every green young shaver in
the secondary schools is confidently expected
to give her the glad eye.
At Sydney Palace the best of all Scottish
comedians is singing a bit of Yankee stuff
in addition to his store of ballads from
Caledonia stern and wild. The crowds plainly
prefer, and continue to beef out, the old
songs—the songs that are always new.

Emelie Polini is nightly committing hari-
kari with the ancestral snickersnee at Syd-
ney Criterion, but is revived in time to mash
a gouty general of brigade in “French
Leave.” The Palace will shortly be the scene
of the rapid resurrection.

The only wintry thing about Sydney
Royal these nights is the name of Hutchin-
son’s play. That agreeable work is still en-
abling a lot of clever mummers to qualify for
the right to pay two income-taxes.
The healthy look of the auditorium at Syd-
ney Opera House shows that Australia is
still interested in “On Our Selection.” But
the Rudd family is getting ready to move
again, the “last-nights” notice having gone up.

arrival at Sydney Tivoli has banished a
gloom that had threatened to fall on the

house between recent departures and the
approach of Julius Knight next Saturday.
Poole is really an ocean in his line. The
programme also owes Nina Gordon a large
debt, and her impersonation of the kilted
Harry is rewarded with the shrill whistle of
the peanut gods.
For luridness Anita Stewart’s fulfilment of
“A Mad Bargain,” at the Sydney Lyceum,
will take some beating. The graceful Anita
suffers from a financial crash, and embarks
upon a wage-slaving career as mannequin
and artist’s model. The persistency with
which she is wooed by the male sex distracts
her, and she is just contemplating suicide
when.... “Brawn of the North,” the extra
film, is providing the Methody barn with the
apparently requisite scenes of violence. At
the Strand a moneyed young lounge-lizard
gets into trouble; and Tom Meighan has the
good fortune to view in advance the tribula-
tions he would have to undergo if he mar-
ried a certain lady. So, of course, this being
a screen play, he marries somebody else.
Monte Blue has another of his good bucolic
roles at the Rialto ; and “Beating the Game”
also keeps moving from start to finish. Hoyt’s
trump card is the inarticulate version of
Booth Tarkington’s “The Flirt.” The “Keep
to the Left” rule is flagrantly broken each
night in the scramble to witness this film.
John Rowell has an art show :
Still another of Melbourne’s more solid young
painters, John Rowell, has come over to show Syd-
ney what landscape painting should be. His exhi-
bition at the New Salon brings the same refreshing
air that characterised the one-man shows of New-
bury, Hampel and Miss Bale. But they haven’t
won much encouragement. One of them, in fact,
did not make expenses, Sydney buyers turning down
at five guineas better pictures than they have bought
for twenties. Certain it is that Sydney is produc-
ing very little work as true to nature as two-thirds
of Rowell’s landscapes. For he goes to Nature free
of any preconceived notions of how to treat her,
producing as a result a sky that looks more like a
sky than mere pigment on canvas, and earth more
like real earth than a series of clever brush strokes.

The fourth of the Evelyn Scotney con-
certs, at Melbourne Town Hall on Saturday,
emphasised the eccentricity of taste in plat-
form entertainment. At the theatre the
public expects performers to entertain it
most of the time, whereas an evening at a
Town Hall is largely spent in listening to
persistent applause, now from one section of
the audience and now from another, while
the singer or instrumentalist walks off the
platform and back again. All sense of dis-
crimination appears to be lost. On Satur-
day one had to sit and suffer through a
trebly-encored performance by a flautist in
knickers, who bids fair to be a pale sugges-
tion of Lemmone when his youth has worn
off and his ear for tune has been educated.
Also a complacent young tenor was required
to sing and sing again after a treatment of
“Where’er You Walk,” which elicited shouts
of grim silence from any who had ever heard
the number forcibly rendered. This tenor,
Mr. Hampson Taylor, lacks many things save
confidence, and the first item necessary to
his future is a refinement of his good Aussie
voice and pronunciation. Cecil Parkes
showed himself little more than a skilled
executant in some boisterously-applauded
violin solos; and Evelyn Seotney, whose
name alone appeared in the advt., was better
able to trill than thrill. While the winsome
little lady warbles sweetly, yet rather un-
feelingly, one usually wonders what it is all
about, for she has a lisp that produces weird
effects in words, no matter what language
she sings in. But the ingratiating person-
ality of the artist is attractive, and a crowded
audience gets a lot of real enjoyment out of
bringing her back to bow some more acknow-
ledgments. The last of her extra concerts
is to-night (Thursday).
Melbourne’s pair of musical long-distance
comedies are repeated with unfailing pre-
cision, no chances to speak of being offered
to understudies. Next week “The O’Brien
Girl” reaches 150 performances at the Prin-
cess’s, whilst “A Southern Maid” scores
her century at Her Majesty’s. But the
Maid’s last weeks are coming.
** * *
At Melbourne King’s the unconcerned hus-
band in “The Silver Fox” continues to
escort his costly wife back to auntie in order
that she may be off the premises while he
institutes proceedings in divorce. It has
been the dream of his married life that the
dear creature would lay herself open to
divorce, but he grieves to think she has mis-
conducted herself with a hasty airman of
ill-repute instead of a trusted poet whose
habit of idealising the giddy lady had ren-
dered him immune to temptation. Nothing
could have persuaded the painful poet to
Fall unless the whole strength of the com-
pany had conspired to push him. And see-
ing that the co. numbers only four, its whole
strength might not have sufiiced.

“Woman to Woman,” at Melbourne Royal,
is still stepping in where “Zaza” long since
ceased to tread. In one respect it is a better
play than that bygone story of the married
man who had a lawful little daughter ere
he set up housekeeping with an actress. It
has a note of hope in the ending. Zaza
turned so unaccountably good that she
wouldn’t hear of marrying her former lover
after he became a widower, but at the finish
of “Woman to Woman” the odds are in
favor of the white-haired lady lending a
favorable ear to anything the father of her
grown-up son may say to her.
* * . * *
Nellie Bramley and Guy Hastings are
following in the tracks of Madge Fabian and
Frank Harvey in “The Land of Promise” at
Melbourne Playhouse. Nellie continues to
strike the wrong note in unexpected places,
but she is highly sensitive of the tragedy
of maidenly modesty suffering “colonial”
experience in a waybaek shack. She breaks
the crockery with proper emphasis when
called upon to wash-up by her victorious
husband, and her subsequent show of fright-
ened surrender affords a faithful picture of
an outraged soul. There are many good
points about Hastings’s uncompromising
brutality as a wife-tamer, but his later soft-
ness is a little tepid as if his education in
politeness had knocked some of the man out
of him. Arthur Cornell makes a very pass-
able husband for Ethel Bashford, who resists
every temptation to storm and rant in express-
ing the jealousy of a sister-in-law. The
plump little lady, in fact, can congratulate
herself on getting a lot of convincing venom
into her part.
# * * s’:
Daisy Jerome, who lately returned to
light at Fullers’ Melbourne Bijou, has worn
well since she was previously there as a
twin star with Wish Wynne. Her songs are
mostly in the one strain, telling of the dan-
gers that await feminine simplicity in the
first place, or the take-down that awaits
young manhood when simplicity grows
wise. But there is something more in Daisy
than a saucy wink and ripe contralto tones.
Her vivacity is never aggressive, and her
magnetic eyes hold the house in subjection.
* ❖ ❖ ❖
The weak points of the “Bulldog Drum-
mond” performance at Melbourne Palace
remain as they were. No unenlightened
observer can surmise a reason for James
Handley consenting to be a tame forger
under the patronage of Carl Peterson, or
understand the drift of some dark allusions
to gambling as between James aforesaid and
an unknown young man who blew his biains
out. To most citizens these things are in-
comprehensible. But what they can un e -
stand is that the style of Bulldog and his
friends in their bachelor home is effeminate,
or “pussylike,” from an Australian point ot
view. Eve Gray, as the lady visitor, seems
also incapable of ginger.
On Saturday Power starts her
series at Melbourne Town Hall, and a lively
public desire to hear the Little Melba
after her years of absence has manifested
itself at the box-office.

previous bellow-

tion that, when a

headstrong son, the
latter is bound to

provide five terrific

ance and emotion.

jestic for the

aroused by “The

comedy is the fes-
tive stable com-
panion to “If I
Were Queen,“
wherein Ethel
Clayton shows
liow she would behave as a royal per-
son. The appetite for piratical literature,
without the R.L.S. touch, is shown by the
popularity of “Yellow Men and Gold” at
the Britannia. “My Friend the Devil,” at
the Melba, just misses the Ignoble Prize for
Literature.
* * * *
“Hello, Prosperity,” a new revue being
given its first run by Lee White and co. at
Adelaide Royal, is just a collection of
pleasant turns which Greig has nailed to-
gether : the title comes from an incidental
song. The carpentry would be better if
it had some set design. Clarice Ilardwicke
and Lance Lister score in several playlets,
notably one in which Grand Guignol thrills
fade away into the commonplace of a den-
tist’s chair. Ernest Sefton is even more
valuable in this kind of work, and Zoe
Wenke can act as well as sing. But why
does she let that mournful expression take
command of her features? There are one or
two striking bits of “spectacle,” but, after
all, Lee White and Clay Smith are the basis
of the show. As long as they exchange
witty back-chat, or his fingers ripple over
the keys while she talks a song, any audi-
ence is content.
The Musgrove Co. has definitely dug-in at
Adelaide P. of Wales for three months at
least, and promises a steady succession of
good turns, some of them for the first time
in Australia. The Geaiks are the funniest
item in sight at the moment; Zellini, Moon
and Morris and Eric Godley’s baritone vary
the proceedings pleasantly. The Majestic
has a similar show, of which the Jim Gerald
Co. provides a good slice. Fred Bluett and
the Enchanted Forest have passed on, but
trained monkeys and other novelties are on
the doorstep. The King’s has re-opened to
let Dr. Rowe and “Mystic Mora” dabble in
the occult.

Melbourne goes on the land: —
Agreeable color characterises Nor ah Gurdon’s huge
parade of canvases at Melbourne Athenaeum. Yet
she never descends to pretty-prettiness, except in
the case of “Looking Towards Warburton,” which
attempts to double the enchantment that distance
lends to a mountain view. She is more successful
in studies of the bush around Toolangi, and in No.
94 she cleverly catches the greyness of a wet day
in that sometimes gloomy region. Some English
snapshots include a hayfield, a field of poppies,
and a pink house at St. Ives, all more or less
pleasing, but too small to allow the lady to fully
demonstrate her art. The same may be said of
various sketches along the Yarra Valley and in Tas-
mania. They are gracefully trivial, and seem to have
been produced for the potboiler market. But there
is stronger work in the figure subjects, which are
all marked by excellent drawing.

“Norbell”: When Amy Castles was a
pupil of Marchesi she wanted to be a lyric
soprano. Madame decided she was a drama-
tic soprano, but that her physique w T as
against her success on the stage in that capa-
city. Before the Bendigonian got to Paris
the local critics were undecided. The Age
declared she couldn’t sing at all, or had been
badly trained. Amy’s first operatic appear-
ance was in an amateur performance of
“Patience” at the Royal Princess’s, Ben-
digo, October 26, ’9S. She was the Patience
and there was a very good cast. E. Allen
Bindley, her first teacher, was the conduc-
tor. “Much-travelled” Smythe went up from
Melbourne to hear the new singer—he had
a wonderful flair for budding stars-—but he
must have been undecided about her capa-
bilities, for lie went back to town without
offering her a contract.
“0.K.” : Long waits between the acts were
introduced to Australia by Sarah Bernhardt;
there is no local tradition of any previ-
ous performer having kept the curtain down
for half-an-hour at a stretch after 11 o’clock,
as Sarah sometimes did. When she was in
New York a paper printed a bogus interview
purporting to give her criticism of some of
the plays then being staged. The interviewer
began: “Unhappily, you have not had the
opportunity to see any of our American
shows, madame?” “Oh, yes,” said Bern-
hardt, “I have bin to all ze theatres —-between
ze acts at my own.”
v “Norbell” : Apropos “Willie’s” yarn about
Allan Wilkie’s experience with a South Aus-
tralian critic (B. 12/4/’23). Wilkie had
been doiug “The Merchant” at a three-pub
town in the wheat zone, and in the train
next day a bearded ancient passed judgment
on his performance as Shylock. “Mind yez,
you was orrite enough,” he condescended;
‘‘but you ain’t got the Yid accent right.
Now, Blandolt was the best Jew on the
boards ever I seen. If you’d ’a’ seen ’im in
‘The World’ wavin’ ’is ’ands like a outside
bookie ’oo’s been took down, an’ sayin’ ‘Vot
am I? Veepin’ Rachel, vot am I?’ you’d
unnerstan’ wot I mean. Ah, Blandolt was
a perfessional actor orrite!”
“Vanloo”: Gregan McMahon made the
mistake of trying to do too much for the
money. At his benefit performance the act-
ing in “Candida” was so good that it seems
a pity to have spoiled the evening by an
indifferent rendering of the first act of “The
Pigeon.” As it was, omitting McMahon, the
honors mostly went to a member of the
company whose name didn’t appear upon
the programme. I refer to Christopher
Welwyn’s lay-figure.
“Lud” : Charles Hawtrey is certainly “over
60,” as “Ibsenshaw” politely puts it (B.
22/3/’23). The actor-knight was born in
1858. In February he was appearing in a
revival of Somerset Maugham’s “Jack
Straw,” which, unknown in Australia, would
lit Lawrence Grossmith admirably. Also, Sir
Charlie (Londoners would as soon think of
calling Dickens “Charlie” as Hawtrey
“Charles”) has come to the front as a pro-
ducer. Vachell’s newest play, “Plus Fours,”
at the Haymarket, is his latest, and every-
body praises the skilful way it has been
put on the stage. Moreover, the industrious
ancient is at work on a play of his own
fabrication. It is 40 years since his adapta-
tion of Yon Moser’s “Bibliothekar,” known
as “The Private Secretary,” took the Eng-
lish-speaking world by storm. Only one
other piece from Hawtrey’s pen has seen
the light since then—a comedy called “Mr.
Martin,” which, done only in London, failed
to hit the bull’s-eye.
“G. Rich”: “Bendoc” (B. 22/3/’23) re-
calls one of my joyous recollections—a
shadow-show with Salome strutting through
Herod’s Court dressed principally in a wrist-
lot watch, a string of beads and high-heeled
French shoes. But the she-actors in most
Yankee attempts at pictorial reconstruction
of history (how they do butcher the
poor old French Revolution!) flash
modern knick-knacks. Also, the lady
mislaid for years on a aeserc isnum
generally steps into the latest in Paris gowns
before she allows the hero to rescue her.
But Australian perdoocers are by no means
guiltless of anachronisms. In a “Snowy”
Baker film that lacerated my sensibilities, a
20th-century tubular-wire gate intrudes into
a cattle-duffing scene, circa 1S50; and the
leading malefactor pumps smoke at the police
with a post-war repeating rifle.
“Minim”: Had there been no such place
as Australia the “Tell Me, Pretty Maiden”
sextette in “Florodora” would never have
been written. So one would infer from what
Leslie Stuart, the composer, recently told a
London newspaper. Said Stuart:—
A young niece of my wife’s had come from Aus-
tralia and was in our care. One day I found her
speaking on the ’phone to an officer of the Australian
liner. I put a stop to the conversation, telling her
we could not countenance such friendships whilst she
was in our charge. She flared up and angrily spoke
her mind about me. When she subsided a bit I
exclaimed: “Are there any more at home like you ?.”
In a flash I saw that I had got the phrase I had been
searching for. Within an hour or so “Oh, tell me,
pretty maiden, are there any more at home like
you?” was finished.
And the number, as everyone knows, was the
biggest hit in the piece.
THE USE OF WORDS.
GOLDSTEIN (of Goldstein’s Performing
Goats) : “Thplendidt engagemendt!
Fabulous thalary!"
WALTER WHITEBAIT: “ Mythical, dear boy,
mythical —not fabulous."
“Rienzi”: Much piffle was written about
the late Bernhardt’s heroism in continuing
to work after she had parted with portion
of a leg. It was reserved for Nathan, of the
N. Y. Smart Set, to pen the just word: —
Why these extravagant hymns to Madame Sarah
Bernhardt because she possesses the courage to appear
on the stage with a wooden leg? A leg is approxi-
mately but one-sixth of the human body. There
are, therefore, any number of star actresses amongst
us who, in the matter of woodenness, have tlie
Madame beaten six to one.
An occasional double-hander like that would
be welcome reading in Australian daily
papers. But the press-agent has most of
them by the hair.
“Gnarek”: Australian composer G. 11.
Clutsam had a hand in the musical play,
“Lilac Time,” which is based on Schubert’s
life, and it was an irreverent hand. “Hark,
Hark, the Lark” is converted into a quin
tette, and “Die Forelle” into a duet. The
ladies of the corps de ballet emerge to the
strains of the March Miktaire, and pirouette
to one of the "Musical Moments.” The over-
ture introduces a Liindler Valtz, and then
hands the melody over to a songandance sex-
tette. Chopin’s March Funebre is played in
Australian restaurants between the soup and
the fish as jazz music. They haven t synco-
pated the Hallelujah Chorus yet, but that
will come.
“Fax”: A better comedy than “The Silver
Fox” is Langdon Mitchell’s “The New r York
Idea,” which is of much the same type. Mit-
chell’s play, which hasn’t been seen in Aus-
tralia, is frankly cynical, whereas the more
recent production affects serious intentions,
but it makes no difference to the effect. “The
New York Idea” was produced 17 years ago,
and still holds its ground in America as the
CONDITIONAL SURRENDER.
HARLEQUIN: “Moon of my delight, may I
print a kiss upon your lips ?”
COLUMBING: “ Well — er — yes, you may print
it, but you mustn't publish it."
nearest approach to a Bernard Shaw comedy
that the country has given birth to. The
main idea is that of a discontented woman
who has broken up her home for a caprice,
suffering agonies of jealousy when her ex-
husband proposes to take advantage of his
freedom to marry again. The incidental
characters and situations are very humorous,
and the story has lively action and three
scenes. If “The Silver Fox,” with its one
scene and superfluity of talk, can entertain
an Australian public, how about the more
kindly and brilliant story of “sinless”
divorce ?
“T.W.”: There are plenty of people ready
to squabble about the money left by singing
celebrities. Contention over Caruso’s leav-
ings is only just settled, and now there are
proceedings in Sweden on the subject of the
£170,000 or so accumulated by Christine
Nilsson. Thirty-three relatives want to
whack it up in place of the 13 people and
institutions Christine chose on her own
account. The outcome of the belligerency
depends largely on whether Melba’s song-
ancestress, who married a Spanish Count,
got herself nationally transmuted again
through being away from the bullfights for
more than a year.
“Machete”: “The Beggar’s Opera” was
not a burlesque of Handel’s Italian operas.
As originally produced it was not an opera
at all, but a satirical comedy with inter-
polated ditties sung to well-known airs of
the day. In the writer's edition, printed in
1732, each song is headed by some such line
as “Air: The Old Woman Dressed in Grey.”
While author and actors are given in full
detail on the title-pages, no mention is made
of a composer. Walpole was the individual
at whom the satire was aimed ; he was the
original of Peachum, the thief-taker and
fence. No doubt, however, the success of
“The Beggar’s Opera” hit Handel hard in
the box-office.
“Pedro”: I am quite prepared to believe
that “Maritana” was composed at New Nor-
folk (Tas.), as well as Rowe-street, Sydney,
and a King-street hotel. It was brought to
birth in several other places. Years ago, as
you journeyed in the train between Redfern
and Summer Hill, you caught sight of a
shack bearing the legend, “Wallace-Maritana
House.” There, you were told, the composer
was safely delivered of the most charming of
all lyrical operas.
“Caesar's Ghost”: About the most chill-
ing experience ever suffered by a mummer
was brought upon himsek by George Majer-
oni in Auckland (M.L.). George’s pa and
ma were then running a dramatic co. Hay-
ing picked up Leader Williams, the scenic
artist, and set him adrift on canvas and
paint, the co. opened with some lavish scen-
ery, which the local papers exalted above
Bland Holt’s best. The big effort was a
lire in a coal-mine, at the end of which the
audience insisted on the curtain being raised
until the stage-hands got tired of shifting it.
Being the gallant youth who had led the
rescue-party, George took all the excitement
as meant for himself. As he ambled on for
the umpteenth time to eat up the applause,
these words smote his astonished ear: “Get
off, you blanky fool! We want the artist!”
“E.T.”: “If Winter Comes” it should find
some of us mummers not quite unprepared.
The piece is being played at the moment in
London and the English provinces, Australia,
S. Africa and U.S.A. (several places). The
Mark Sabre of one of the casts in the last-
named country is old friend Cyril Maude,
who bobs up serenely all over the globe.
“Loud”: Those who revive in London the
less-known Elizabethan plays have at last
accepted the principle of expurgating lines
which are offensive to modern taste. Curi-
ously enough, the first cutting was not in
the interests of morality, but to bring the
character of Joan of Arc in line with the
modern conception of the Maid. Who-
ever wrote “Henry V 1.,” Shakspeare, Greene
or Marlowe, had evidently much the same
opinion of her as the Britisher of to-day has
of the Kaiser, and made her needlessly offen-
sive. For the recent revival Joan’s speeches
were heavily toned down.
“Wilfrido” : On one of his “off” nights in
Wellington (M.L.), the pianist Spivakovsky
was the guest of the Jewish Social Club,
which gave a concert to celebrate the great
event. When the outbreak was over Spiv,
declined a kindly invitation to take a hand
at poker, and dashed away to the local
Cabaret Club to jazz in a more exclusive
but less racial atmosphere. There he fainted.
Exhaustion may have been, and probably
was, the cause of it, but the Cabareters
swear that the concert was enough to throw-
anyone off his balance. The Chosen retali-
ate by alleging that the patient selected un-
consciousness as an escape from the music
to which he was expected to dance.
“Pedro”: Laura Villiers, with whom Julius
Knight made his first appearance in Sydney
(B. 12/4/’23), was a Titian-haired Lon-
doner who reputedly had plenty of money.
Her best play was Henry Arthur Jones’s
“The Dancing Girl,” in which a hit was made
by Clifton Alderson, an English provincial
actor, who never got a show on London
boards. Knight in those days was merely
a promising youngster. “The Dancing Girl”
was offered by Jones to Willard. “Thanks,”
replied Willard, “I don’t dance !”
“Cartot” : Why does “V.C.” (B. 5/4/’23)
call Kobey the Court Jester? Isn’t it suffi-
ciently mortifying to be a C.8.E.? The cap-
and-bells job was abolished hundreds of
years ago. Contemporary writings show that
it was non-existent in the reign of Charles
1., and none of the standard histories men-
tion it as having been re-created at a later
date. The royal joke-maker’s job was a
feudal institution, belonging mostly to the
later Middle Ages. Even then there were
rulers who got all the fun they wanted, ably
assisted by the Court ladies, without the aid
of Wamba the son of Witless.
“Second Murderer”: Whilst urging an
adequate censorship of the movies, let us re-
member that the spoken drama’s morals are
very groggy at the knees occasionally. From
one angle “Hamlet” is only a series of low
intrigues, treachery, lies and lechery, spiced
with felo de se and homicide. The whole
cast is wiped out by murder or suicide, with
the exception of Horatio and Osric, and there
is little excuse for exempting the latter; be-
sides, Horatio threatens to commit suicide.
Alfred Dampier pointed out to me that, re-
garded fi’om an ethical standpoint, “Rob-
bery Under Arms,” his long suit, was a hor-
ribly perverted play. Starlight, the bush-
ranger, an outlaw with a price on his head,
gets a free pardon from the N.S.W. Govern-
ment. So does the other desperado, Dick
Marston. Warrigal gets a soft snap as use-
ful at a station. Jim is shot, by accident,
apparently. Dan Moran is certainly pinched,
but as a set-off police-inspector Goring is
also arrested. The good young man of the
piece is made a member of Parliament, so
he falls under grave suspicion. Virtue is
not always triumphant in theatrical per-
formances, “The Mikado” notwithstanding.
“Ring Bolt”: Apropos of veteran mum-
mers, can any Pointer tell me what became
of H. A. (Harry) Douglas? The last time
I saw him was in 1897, behind the footlights
of Hobart Royal, taking the part of the Old
Corporal to Rignold’s Tommy Atkins. A
hard case was Harry. I was walking with
him one afternoon —things were so good with
him that he sported a frock coat and bell-
topper—when a flapper made him the target
of the then-popular gag “I’ll have that hat.”
“Take it. my dear.” said Harry, flinging the
tile at her feet, “but I think a dam’ good
■lapping would do you more good.”
THE POWER OF MUSIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As I sat at the boarders’ piano
My fingers stole over the keys
(My thoughts idly roved with Diana)
In a sort of a go-as-you-please.
1 must have been playing with feeling
As the Johnny Hop passed on his beat;
1 felt a cold sweat o’er me stealing
As I heard the dull thud of his feet.
He paused, and some language he uttered —
It may have been part of a psalni,
But, as my room-window was shuttered,
1 only could catch the word “damn,”
A tangible, definite damn.
While I dealt out my music bewitchin’
With reckless abandon and ease,
My landlady cursed in the kitchen,
And I heard the poor bed-puncher sneeze.
Outside, on the wo xlheap reclining
The rouseabout started to pray,
The dog in the yard began whining,
And a child cried a few blocks away ;
The cat, that was always complacent,
Flew out of the door in a rage,
And a bird in a window adjacent
Fell dead on the floor of its cage,
Collapsed with a sob in its cage.
Intent on his parish inspections
The parson came round to the door,
But gone were his meek genuflections,
He stood on the carpet and swore.
He howled like the Turk at Vienna,
And vowed, like a person insane,
He’d see us all safe in Gehenna
Before he would visit again.
AVhat ailed the poor fellow, I wonder?
He didn’t like music, I fear.
Whatever ’twas made him knock under
It wasn’t for want of an ear,
He could swat the flies off with his ear.
As I played on, a slave of the bottle
Swore “dry,” with a water-tank friend,
And my mate, who had ne’er wet his throttle,
Went off with a rush on the bend.
I was doing quite well when Diana
Slipped into my room with a stick,
And I went from that blessed piano
With tail down and deucedly sick.
I’ve often since tried to recapture
Those notes that were pleasing, if few,
But mv board-mates assever with rapture
They’ll strip off my hide if I do,
They’ll skin me alive if I do.
WESTRA’IA.

c ßenew Tour Linoleum
Is your linoleum dull and deadlooking? Bring it back to life
and it will reflect a bright, clean, well-cared-for home. All you
need is Johnson’s Prepared Wax and a cloth. The Wax gives
a dry, glossy, dustless polish of great beauty and durability.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax brings out the pattern of linoleum
—preserves and protects it from wear. It doesn’t take long—
an ordinary sized floor can be polished in less than an hour
and it may be walked upon immediately. Waxed linoleum
and tile are easy to keep clean —they require but little care.
JOHNSON’S
Paste—Liquid—Powdered
PREPARED WAX
Polish all your furniture, wood-
work and floors with Johnson’s
Prepared Wax. It forms a thin,
protecting coat over the varnish,
similar to the service rendered by
a piece of plate glass over a table
or dresser top. It covers up mars
and small surface scratches, and
prevents checking and cracking.
Johnson's Prepared Wax is made
in paste, liquid and powdered form.
Use the Liquid Wax for polishing
furniture, woodwork, leather goods
and motor-cars. We advise the
Paste Wax for polishing floors of
all kinds wood, linoleum, tile,
marble, &c. The Powdered Wax
will give a perfect dancing surface.

Have you
read this new
and very
much talked
of book?
â
Eleanor Gray
tells you
how
to always look
your best
‘TXT’ AS there ever a woman in the
Y/%/ world who couldn’t recall some-
* * time, somewhere, a sombre hour
spent alone in front of her mirror wishing
she were different.”
So begins this intimate interesting book
that cleverly deals with every woman’s
problem of making the very most of her
natural attractiveness.
A Practical Style Authority
Miss Gray is a practical style authority;
she has studied the problems of thousands
of women. She knows and understands the
different types and just how each type
should express personality and beauty in
clothes. Her new book “You” gives ad-
vice and suggestions how to attain that
lovely picture every real woman wants to
make of herself —and do it without in
any way increasing the money you now
spend for dress.
Miss Gray discusses the important subject
of proportions in her new book and shows
the necessity of wearing a corset especially
proportioned to your figure needs. She
advises a Gossard Corset because Gossards
are the only corsets designed unerringly
for different figure types. Their front-
lacing comfort, their light scientific bon-
ing, their graceful, natural lines are worth
more to the woman who really cares about
her health and appearance than can be
put into shillings and pence. And yet they
are among the most reasonably priced
articles of clothing to be had today. Do
you realize you can buy a genuine, trade-
marked Gossard Corset for as little cost
as the ordinary corset?
Gossard Brassieres
And Miss Gray recommends your particular
attention to the new Gossard Longerlyne
Brassieres. They are differently designed
for those many women who need special
support at the diaphragm as well as added
length to their brassieres to prevent them
slipping up over the lower tops of the
modern corsets.
Go to the Best Store You Know
You can buy Gossard Corsets and Bras-
sieres at good stores everywhere. The
best store you know is sure to sell them
and render you a fitting service that will
assure you satisfaction.
Use the Coupon Below
While it is on your mind, send for your
copy of “You”. Use the coupon; and
remember that you can depend upon Miss
Gray’s personal advice to help you look
your best. If you have the slightest diffi-
culty in finding the exactly-right Gossard,
Miss Gray will be glad to see that you are
supplied with the model you should have.

TASMANIAN INDUSTRY
mHE new factory ,of Cadbury-Fry-Pascall
JL Ltd., at Claremont, Tasmania, is now
completed and equipped. It is a fine pile of
buildings, set in delightful surroundings,
betwmen the mountains and the sea, open to
the cooling breezes which blow from the
great hills to the north-west, and the still
cooler breezes which in their turn sweep
up the Derwent Estuary from the Great
Southern Ocean.
One cannot conceive a more healthful
spot, and the building itself, replete with
every contrivance for hygiene and comfort,
is quite in keeping with its environment.
Initial difficulties have been overcome,
and already quite a number of Pascall’s Con-
fectionery Lines, and some of Cadbury’s
and Fry’s, such as Bourneville Cocoa,
Cadbury’s Mexican Chocolate, Fry’s Homeo-
pathic Cocoa, and Fry’s selected Chocolates
in tins, are on sale in the shops ; others are
coming forward almost weekly.
Experience is showing that there is no
reason why, under the favorable conditions
which Claremont affords, the reputation for
quality which each of the constituent firms
(Cadbury-Fry-°ascall) has built up in the
old land] should not be maintained —not to
say increased —in Australia.

'Y' HE SALESMAN who can design and write
his own Show Cards and execute his own
advertising matter is not only invaluable in
the way of obtaining business for his employer,
but can succeed on his own account.
The art of designing becomes a fascinating
pleasure, that once you have mastered the theory
you feel you must go on till you make it a
highly payable and pleasant occupation.
In a few lessons you will be able to do plain
ticket writing and then advance until the most
elaborate and artistic show card is in your
power to execute.
Because we want to add hundreds of more
names to our list of satisfied students at an early
date we are making a Special Price to purchase
the course outright.
Special Price, £3 3/-
(REGULAR PRICE £5 AND £6)
OTHERS SELL IT FOR £l2 TO £2O.
Act quickly as this special opportunity may be
open for only a short period. Many purchasers
have written similar to C. W. Owen, of New-
castle, who recently wrote: —
“I can’t see how you ask so little, while
others with far inferior courses get from £l3 to
£20.”

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will b*
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
S.L.A.: For the thousandth time, please
don’t send stamps with MS. of paragraphs. We
can’t undertake to return that class of copy....
Corona: Alas, that lion has been roaming around
for years... .Julia Creek: Yes, we got to the end of
it, and every word was true. .. .Niable: Put name
and address on back of each par; a covering letter
is unnecessary... .J.L.S.: This much, at least, shall
not be lost: —
Some little consolation yet might I ask to share,
Would you, kind stranger, upon me thus confer?
An action at .m.y bidding, may be the last short note,
To drop into the household and tell my dear old folk
1 am going strong at mending, and up against it
straight,
And plugging hard scrub-cutting at early morn and
late.
....Quest: Too loosely pretty; but keep on trying.
. ...P.B.P: No use. .. .D.M.C.: Too ponderous....
Discarded Lover: Only a nasty suggestion. .. .G.J.M.:
P00r.... J.G.P.W.: Not a bad shot; but it missed.
. ...A.M. (Fleipington): Study some good verse
forms. Your way is easier, but it will never make a
poet of y0u....C.8. (Gisborne): Bumpy common-
| place. . . .Rotto: Dirge suitable for the sad album of
a seedy lady. .. . G.C.8.: Whatever idea there was is
lost in bad verse.,. .13.11. G.: Not well enough hand-
led. .. .0.D.W.: No use here... .R.L.J.: Poor stuff
poorly done. .. .W.E.8.: Doesn’t strike u5....8.J.:
(Manly): Both get out of step. .. .E.N.G.: If you
“have sold a lot of MSS. to European and American
magazines” of that quality, better keep on doing it.
... .R.D.M.: No use. . . .Sucre: The “Noise” amounts
to nothing... .11.V.E.: What sort of a jumble have
you made of the real story ? There is, by the way,
neither 1 nor cin the Maori language... .Annie M.:
“Heridity” 'fails,., .0.0. (S.A.) : “Demesne” won’t
rhyme with “between”; it will with “rain.”....
Doris P.: First, get something to write about....
Parous: The verse is very bad ; the humor very sor-
rowful. .. .F.C.8.: Yes, it is infinitely sad that a
river will flow downhill... .D.G. (Glebe): The verse
doesn’t carry it... . Augustus W.: Here it is in all
its Teutonic candor: —
Another War of Waterloo is in sight
just as Napolion of yor and his might
“once more to Moscow,” Napolion said;
this time our Ways are oppen and bright—
we will beat this time. England too.
no more Blucher will come to rescue
in this War at Waterloo.
When we got England we get Canada too ;
then we will go to Australia Kangeroo ;
we will put blak soldier in all their land,
never alowing a white man a gun in hand,
we are the Napolions, we are the Franeh.
we belong to a high superior branch,
no more at Blucher we shall blench.
....Tyro (Longreach) : Afraid you don’t know much
of the ways of the city middleman. While Sydney is
paying up to 4d. apiece for apples, thousands of
apple-trees are being rooted up within 100 miles of
the city because it costs more to get the fruit to
market (quite exclusive of costs of cultivation) than
the stuff brings wholesale... .El Dorada: The verse
won’t do ; but you should have interesting matter....
Howitzer: You start a yarn and hurriedly wind it up
before it gets to anything.... Patrick M.: Terrible
verse and not much of a yarn... .Baal G.: It’s an old
theme and only fairly well handled.... James W.:
Have no idea; but it’s pretty poor stuff... .E.J.8.:
Lumpy verse about a not very thrilling piece of
foolishness... .E.A.M.: A refrain of five lines re-
peated three times without one true rhyme—it’s
over the odds.... Quintilian: A lifeless little intrigue
described without color or feeling. .. .John B.: You
haven’t got enough into the “Mail” (yarn... . .
H.S.T.: Send it to the Curate’s Gazette Eunis
P.: Not nearly.... Ex: “Paradise” has too many
clumsy lines..,. J.S.: We’re glad the swagman gets
to Heaven and finds it satisfactory:—
“Ah, Billy, what seekest thou ?
If it’s work, there’s none.
But the boys are in the Garden—
You can go and join the fun.”
Moral.
A life that is not lived
And a deed that is still to do
Is a life that is lived in vain—
Don’t let it occur to you.
.... Carlyle G.: “The Reckoning” doesn’t mean
enough ; “Mum” has a loose line with an extra foot
kicking in irritation; there is not enough in the
other.... C.L.C.: An even mass of commonplace....
Stanley C.: You haven’t finished your job
V. : We struggled through the ragged copy to
discover there was no yarn... .M.S. (Clovelly) :
Doesn’t hit us in the right place Buttercup: Very
pale little flower F.E.G.: Couldn’t be much worse
Jenny H.: Has only a sentimental interest....
R.R.: (Tonga) : Verse not up ; prose too extravagant.
.... C.S.R.: The method takes the force out of it; but
you should write in a place like that. .. .L.W.W.:
The gist of it is that the accommodation at the
place was poor and the road muddy. That isnt
madly exciting. .. .Jackadgery: The “dauntless
pioneer, swelting in an unceasing flow of perspira-
tion,” is too much like too many other sweaty
pioneers Anon: We’re not hankering for transla-
tions ; and we like them less when scansion is wild
and rhyming horrible G.0.K.: There is a subtle
difference between writing verse and sawing boards.
J.L.S.: Too rugged.... E.F.W.: Doesn’t get
near enough to say “G’day” to the accountant....
A.P.W.: Not all the “tears that come wheling” can
move us Valmac: Not bad as a school exercise...
John S.: Horrible. .Long G.: Too slight....
H.F.L.: All off the target W.K.P.: Hundreds of
cockatoos in Australia could give yours points....
Odsbodkin: Avaunt and learn to arrange your
thoughts more tidily Hayseed: But the directory
says there’s only one man of that name in Hay, not
thousands.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)

provement ; but will use one as suggestion J.W.:

When the spark
says GO///
Then TEXACO, the volatile* Motor Spirit,
responds—instantly. It puts the GO into your
motor for a quick get-away or the full-power
steady pull.
In less than 100th part of a second every particle of
motor spirit should completely give up its power. Texaco
Motor Spirit does this to the last molecule. It gives up
its power and gives it quickly.
If you buy motor spirit by habit, then try a new method
for better all-round results. Ask specifically for Texaco,
the volatile Motor Spirit, and watch the difference in
your motor. All garages can supply.
* Vol-a-tiNity— the readiness with which
motor spirit gives up its power.

has proved itself a winner. You cannot make a
mistake by taking a few tins because it is so tempting,
so satisfying, so economical, and so hdndy. It’s all
meat —yet so different from other tinned meats.
You serve it straight from the tin —either by itself —
or with salad, pickles or chutney. Great either way!
And there’s enough in each tin for five persons.

everywhere solving the heavy service
problems of huge main drives. It
efficiently stands up to the gruelling
conditions imposed. It transmits the
greatest degree of power at the smallest

transmission where speed is terrific,
accuracy essential and vibration must
be reduced to a minimum; and on
individual motor drives involving small
pulley diameters and severe fluctuation
of loads.

“Sucre” : Proud Rockhampton, the “capi-
tal of Central Queensland,” suffered the in-
dignity of having the bailiffs in possession
of its civic chambers a Avhile back. An
unsatisfied judgment in favor of an ex-
inspector of the council was the cause.
When the bailiff—an ex-municipal tram-
striker —prepared to arrange his pillow and
rugs for the night in the Town Clerk’s
office, the Mayor drew a cheque and pushed
the ogre into the darkness.

“J.A.”: In the early days of S. Aus. the
Methodists at Clarendon decided to build
a manse for their minister. As there was
some trouble about the finances, a resident
offered the committee £2OO on the condition
that it paid him £2O a year for the rest of
his life. The generous gent, didn’t look too
healthy, so the offer was accepted and the
work carried out. As time passed the
guarantors began to scratch their heads —
and they went on scratching them, for the
donor lived for 42 years.

-Lomb ’: A farmer on the Kingaroy line
(Q.) put in 25 acres of cotton. The dry
weather struck him and the crop looked a
failure, whereupon he ploughed-in 20 acres
and would have buried the lot had his wife
not prevailed upon him to leave a little for
luck. The five-acre plot is now yielding a
tiP-top crop which is going to pay all exes,
ot the farm and leave something for beer-
money. Of course, it’s Mr. Cocky who kids
mmself on being longheaded. But’you should
see the grin his wife is wearing.

“Vingt Six”: “Centre” asks (P>. 8/3/’23)
the actual food-weight from an acre of
bananas. It depends on the number of
stools to an acre. Here at Eumundi (Q.)
we plant from 6ft. to 12ft.- apart; but per-
sonally I find Bft. the best, giving roughly
600 stools to an acre. Each stool yields two
bunches per year of approximately 501 b. of
actual food-weight per bunch, equal to
60,0001 b. per acre. This would pay better
than murphies if “Centre” got a fair go
from the southern agents. We don’t.
* * * »
“Wilfrido”: Postage-stamps provide an
illustration of the fall in the exchange value
of the German mark and the Austrian
kronen. The former was valued at Is. and
the latter at lOd. In 1918 any frau could
write to her relatives in the colonies at the
cost of 15 pfennig (lOOpf. going to one mark) ;
m 1920 it cost her 80pf.; in 1921 it went to 120
Penis'; this year the cost has increased to
10,000 pfennig or 100 marks. In Austria, at
the outbreak of war, a letter carrying a
stamp of j kronen (2-Jd.) would have passed
through the post office, but with this week’s
mail came a letter franked with 1500 kronen,
equal (pre-war) in our money to £6O.

Sucre” : Melbourne keeps on passing re-
solutions which “view with alarm the high
price of sugar.” Melbourne ought to read
the IjOUlsiana Planter's record of the em-
ployment of child-labor in the eanefields of
America. There 2500 children, from 7 to
16 years old, are engaged in the in-
dustry. Three-fourths of this army of white
slaves work in the fields. The average hours
are 9, climbing to 13 in some cases. Yet
the wholesale price of sugar in New York
is 3£d. a lb. Australia’s retail price is 4|d.
—only three _ farthings dearer than the
wholesale price in America. Melbourne
under the pretence of lessening the cost
of the sugar drowned in its tea, reaches
out for the impossible—cheap white labor
in the eanefields, or its alternative, the colored
man. Melbourne’s “national soul” is buried
m a 21b. tin of its jam, and the half-a-pound
of Queensland sugar at 2jd. a lb. that helps
to fill the tin hurts like a hard corn. For
an industry that has so far proved to be the
only means of promoting the closer settle-
ment of our tropical regions, the import duty
on foreign-grown sugar is ridiculously low,
viz., £9 6s. Bd. a ton. America has a duty
of £9 19s. Bd., and the United Kingdom asks
for £25 13s. 4d. The average return from
a North Queensland sugar-farm is about 700
tons of cane. At £2 2s. a ton, a farmer’s turn-
over is £1470. Wages absorb over £970
general upkeep, etc., £l5O, leaving £3OO-odd
tor clothing, food, taxes, bad seasons, motor-
cars and cigars. For the sake of a White
Australia, and as a bulwark against colored
aggression, Melbourne should keep on paving
4fd. for its pound of sweetening.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A vynt has been issued out of the District Court,
at the instance of the licensee of the Hampden Hotel,
Pennant Hills, against William Morris Hughes, ex-
Prime Minister, in connection with a claim for £l5
tor board and lodging.” —Sydney race-week news
item.
The Rand wick races came, the Easter Show,
And with them the publicity He loved.
Once more the rustics, faces all aglow,
Sat at a town-bred Premier’s feet, and shoved
And elbowed to secure a better place,
\\ herefrom to hear that lecture on their trade
Which every city Premier has the face
To offer yearly to the Bush Brigade—
But He whom bushies once cheered loud and long
W as not a member of the platform throng.
Once more those folks whom Governors delight
To entertain at Randwick had their names
Presented to a puzzled public’s sight—
Men who had been His creatures ; men whose games
Had somewhat staggered even Him were there;
Men He had raised from nothing; small, dull men
With naught to recommend them but a flair
For grabbing all the cash within their ken—
But not Himself who, previous to His fall,
Had walked the world the master of them all.
Elsewhere, that tireless trier, Rosenthal,
Roared menaces at those who this fair land
Would bring beneath Disloyalism’s thrall,
Spurred on by Weaver, Mrs. Cappie Shand
And others who once stamped and cheered for Him
What time the self-same sentiments and threats
He voiced in tliund'rons tones and accents grim.
How soon the world its Kaiser Bills forgets!
The only notice that we now afford
Our Bill is when he’s writted for his board.

Machine
FOR EVERY PURPOSE
In choosing your Motor Cycle from
the
n
□
range, no matter for what purpose
you require the machine, there is a
model to suit those requirements
exactly.
The B.S.A. standard of work-
manship and materials is rigidly
adhered to.
At every vital point each B.S.A.
model is made doubly safe by
reason of specially selected Shef-
field Steel drop forgings, and now
all models are fitted with the
B.S.A. three-speed countershaft
gear.
For economical motoring a B.S.A.
will serve you best.
You can obtain your mount and
all details as to H.P. and prices
from—
D. Y. RENNIE
Representing the B.S.A. Co. Ltd.,
Australian Buildings, Elizabeth Street, Melbourne,
Or from these State Agents:
N.S.W.: Bennett & Wood,
Limited, Pitt Street, Sydney.
VIC.: Finlay Bros., Elizabeth
Street, Melbourne.
Q’LAND: Canada Cycle &
Motor Agency, Creek Street,
Brisbane.
S.A.: J. N. Taylor & Co., Ltd.,
Grenfell Street., Adelaide.
W.A.: Mortlock Bros., Queen
Street, Perth.
TAS.t J. Bilyard, Elizabeth
Street, Hobart. Sim King, 63
Brisbane Street, Launceston.
Do You Use a B.S.A. Gun ?
“Vincimus”: “Pantagruel’s” lady (B.
S/3/’23) didn’t put up the longest continu-
ous railway record by travelling from Mackay
(Q.) to Perth (W.A.). Four years ago I
went through from Longreach (Q.) to
Perth, which is 226 miles further.
“Plasmon” : Ballarat seems to be a forcing-
ground for Labor politicians. Besides
Federal member McGrath, Senator Barnes
and E. J. Hogan, the towering member for
Warrenheip in the Vic. Assembly, reside in
the district. J. A. McNeill, the new M.H.B.
for Wannon and vice-president of the Vic.
section of his party, also lived at Ballarat,
and Scullin, who succeeded Tudor in the
Reps., edited the Echo in the same village.
Like Barnes, Scullin is a past president, and
J. Kean and T. C. Carey, both Ballarat
men, have held high office, at the Trades
Hall, though they haven’t yet got into Par-
liament.
“Tin Hat”: The Victoria, now en route
from Melbourne to China, carries 300 cases
of mixed fruits packed in accordance with
the new Greig Allen storage system. Four
steel tanks, each about 7ft. square, were
made for this practical test: in these.the
cases of fruit were packed, the airtight lids
screwed down and all air pumped out. It
is claimed by the inventors that not only
fruit but practically all perishable articles
of food can be kept quite good for long
periods in a vacuum, and -without the loss of
flavor that results from the refrigerating
process. Should the plan prove a success it
will revolutionise the export of perishables.
“Lexite”: The reason why new Sydney
buildings do not scrape the paint off the
sky is that regulation forbids their going
beyond a certain height. But dozens of new-
planned structures are to go the limit. A
fire a few months ago demolished the
National Buildings, in Pitt-street, and 12
storeys are now to replace it. This is start-
ing the cloud-disturbing industry in a new
spot, as most of the buildings thereabouts
are old and of the lowly stature favored by
Sydney’s ancestors. A new element of
raggedness will be introduced to the city’s
skyline; but within the next two years no
less than eight allotments in the same block
will be carrying edifices likely to be equally
lofty. They will make Pitt-street look more
like a lane than ever.
“Hal G.”: Once a building has been a
hotel and become delicensed, it never seems
to hold its head up again, so to speak. It
generally becomes a boarding-house or small
ham-and-beef shop, and it is very seldom
that it is rebuilt enough or repainted enough
to hide the fact that it was once a pub.
Somehow, it still looks like a pub, and there’s
always a suggestion of vanished back bars
and silenced laughter about it. One I saw
the other day looked the most miserable old
building I’ve ever seen. It had a ticket
hanging in a once-proud bar-window: “Lodg-
ings for Respectable Single Men.” The poor
old place was as near to tears as a building-
can be.
„ “Otus” (M.L.) : No, Trotsky wasn't born
Trotsky (B. 8/3/’23) : he was born Broil-
stem—Leiba Bronstein, and changed his
name when czardom was reaching out for
him. It was on his release from a Russian
prison that the idea occurred to him that
by assuming the name of his gaoler he might
retain his liberty longer than would other-
wise be the case. So Bronstein became
Trotsky. An exile from his native land, he
has been expelled from Austria, driven from
Spain, sentenced (by default) in Germany,
and imprisoned by the English in Canada.
He was in America ivhen the war broke
out, and when Czar Nicholas was bumped
off the throne Trotsky determined to return
to Russia. But, anyhow, what special
demerit is there in Vladimir Ilyitch TJHanov
giving himself the new name of Nicolai
Lenin, or Leiba Bronstein changing his mon-
niker to Leo Trotsky? I can’t remember
any great fuss when Hanover became Wind-
sor—and for not nearly so substantial a rea-
son as actuated TJlianov and Bronstein.
A re-union was held at Bathurst (N.S.W.)
recently, and at least one hopeful orator
was present:—
Brother Bernard, of Holy Cross College, Ryde,
thought that Ireland should accept what she could
get and hold out her hand for more. The Free State
was beyond their wildest dreams, but when Ireland
had her own army and navy they would, take what
they wanted.
Certainly wonders have been done by little
peoples who had a taking way. Normandy
was only a petty fragment of France, yet it
took England, Ireland, Sicily and sundries,
and supplied kings to Scotland. Denmark
looks hardly worth a mention; still the
Danes annexed England, and occasionally
Norway and Sweden. Portugal is smaller
than Ireland; all the same, it owned half
a continent and had property in three more.
Holland is less than half the area of the
Irish Free State, but it still owns a noble
colonial empire. And it had a surpassing
record as a sea-fighter. Venice, not much
larger in its beginnings than Goat Island,
took Greece, Dalmatia, much of the Archi-
pelago, a share in the Crusades, and the
public eye. But the day for heroic happen-
ings of the sort seems past, somehow.
“Harold Ilardupp”: No body of public
robbers has displayed a more callous disre-
gard for the public than the Australian egg-
manipulator. He fixed a rate of release for
export at Is. 6d. per dozen, of which a
penny was to go into a pool to cover pos-
sible losses, thus maintaining the principle
of the dear egg for local use. As a matter
ot fact, the egg people didn’t mind the ex-
port business resulting in a slight loss, so
long as it enabled them to maintain pirati-
cal rates against the local consumer. But
the hard-working peasantry of France, Bel-
gium, Holland and Denmark, making haste
to get over the crippling effects of war are
producing quantities of eggs for which they
, , tain > as the neighbor best able to
aftord luxuries, the best customer; and thou-
sands of cases of Australian eggs are lield
in cold store in England because it is not
profitable to put them upon a market where
eggs are selling for 9d. to Is. a dozen. With
freight and cold-store charges taken into con-
sideration, the pretty scheme for robbing
the local consumer may thus hit the exporter
hard before the final cleaning up. But the
local consumer will not gain by it— he won’t
get the cheap eggs: they are in England

Rexona.
Never a day passes but that Rexona scores another triumph
over those serious troubles of life, Sores, Bad Legs, Piles, Eczema,
Pimples, Blotches, Burns, Nasal Catarrh and Rheumatism. The
dainty little triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid Healer, contains a
combination of the most antiseptic, soothing and healing properties
known to science.
Rexona is the Skin Remedy of the Age, because it destroys
the harmful germs that may be present in a sore, pimple or any
abrasion of the skin, thus preventing any contagion of the blood,
and at the same time causes a new, healthy skin to grow. Rexona
immediately reduces the inflammation and pain; it acts as a distinct
stimulant to the pores of the skin, and sets up a healing action
immediately that increases day by day.
Bad leg sores that have resisted every other treatment succumb
almost immediately to its wonderful influence, while for Piles there
is nothing its equal.
In every home Rexona is an essential need, and if going away
for a holiday don’t let your vacation be spoiled by any of the usual
troubles, such as Sandfly or Mosquito Bites, Sore Feet, or the ever-
occurring Cuts, Burns and Bruises incidental to holiday-making; but
take with you a pot of Rexona and a box of Rexona Soap, and thus
be able to enjoy your holiday to the full. Rexona, the Rapid
Healer, sold only in Triangular Pots at 1/6 and 3/-

I.—Of the Ass that Pined for Oates.
AN Ass that lived not leanly ’mid the
Tents of Alif Khan
Dreamed strangely that he’d be as
wise and strong- as any Man
Could be but have his fill of Dates. With
that he languished sore
A-gazing at the Palms and all the lofty
Fruit they bore.
Could he but fly, he told himself, he straight
might feed his Fill,
So privily he sought and strove to learn to
fly, until
A day when he stood on a Crag of a sky-lifted
Hill.
Sure of his Skill, he flung himself from that
far rocky Height
And crashed below upon the Plain where he
lay woe-bediglit.
He leaned his head upon a Palm whose
ripening Dates he spied,
And brayed of Fate's Injustice to the worthy
Beasts, and died.
ll. — Of the Camel that. Was Enamored of
Zuleiha.
A camel of El Mahmoud’s train saw young
Zuleika tripping by,
And straight himseemed that if the Maid
blessed not his Passion he must die.
By Day he gazed at her. At Night he
dreamt of her till break of Day,
And sickened of his Longing till his Strength
all ebbed away.
Mis Driver cursed him, and his Hide with
many a blow was scarred ;
And still he rolled an amorous Eye and wepl
his Fortune hard.
Whence on a Day they cast him forth and
left him to his Fate
With Jackals howling down the wind. Then
in the Dark he sate
And prayed good Death to save him soon
from Pain and Shame and Woe
Of loving One who knew him not and whom
he might not know.
lII. — Of the Mare that Would Preach.
By way of Gift to Ibn Zabr there came a vir-
gin desert Mare
Of price and pace. “Now,” said the Sheik,
“only Fatima she shall bear,
Whenas to Hammam or Bazar as suits her
Whim that Lady goes,
Who as a Houri glads the Night and is
more lovely than the Rose
When Morning comes to drape the World
with Purples, and no evil Fate
Can turn to Shame or Fear man’s Thoughts
from Allah the Compassionate.”
To Fatima the milk-white Mare gave grudg-
ing Service. Sombre-eyed
The Mare saw all the Faithful turn to
Mecca at the Eventide.
She heard the Call to Prayer. She heard
Darwish and Imam piously teach
The way of Faith; and to the Crowd of
Worshippers she yearned to Preach.
Preaching not, she gave to her Dame more
grudging Service day by day,
And kicked her Groom, and bit her Stall,
and from her Forage turned away
'Rhus in the end fair Fatima lost patience
with the Mare, and sent
i r to a Stallion fierce and proud for Dis-
cipline and Chastisement.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
171 ACING the sea the little house stood
1 among its flower-beds like a mean,
unlovely “personage” surrounded by
gorgeous servitors. Even the vast grandeur
of the coastline was dimmed in comparison
with this acre or so or mixed and living
color.
All the ships of Tarshish might have cast
their splendors about this little shabby house.
For here was gold and saffron, royal purple
and crimson in reckless abundance, a not of
color to catch the eye and set the pulses beat-
ing faster. If there be passion in color then
there was passion indeed surrounding this
little house by the sea.
We wondered if we might buy boiling
water there to save tne need of lighting a
hre. He, weary with steering the motor-
boat for many miles, had already Hung him-
self full length upon the sand, already revel-
ling, to the point of intoxication, m the
wonder of blue sky, golden-pina sand, green-
blue ocean, and white-fringed, mantling
breakers. It was left for the woman to find
the meal. Hesitatingly I approached the
garden gate.
Honestly, I felt as though I were approach-
ing ihe Halls of Solomon to ask for a pot of
boiling water. As I hesitated I noticed,
half-hidden by the flushing beauty of a pink
rambler, a tiny notice-board that informed
the lonely coastline that afternoon-tea was
served with.n
It was a demure, shy little board. It
seemed* almost ashamed of itself, as though
it felt out of place amidst the sweet pro-
fusion of ihe res' s. Perhaps the owner of
the garden was n t so put to it but that he
could pick and choose his customers; or
perhaps he meant his little shadowed board
to attract only those who had the seeing eye.
Anyway, I approached the cottage, tapped,
and asked for tea or boiling water.
Tea was offered, and I was invited to enter
thetmy living-room while the water boiled.
The owner of the house was a lady with
faded eyes and hair, a faded smile, and a
manner of quiet exactness. She was cer-
tainly old enough to have some sort of his-
tory, and there was about her that air of
something more thrilling than history—it
was romance.
Was I in a hurry?
I was not. Re had his pipe and the
breakers for company, and now that I had
seen this Keeper of the lln 11s of Solomon
I wanted to know something about her
For a moment she left me and returner!
to tell me that kettles, in the afternoon, were
always slow to boil. Was I thinking of
staying in these parts for any length of
tune? Camping, for instance?
1 Sfn '<L we could spend only the afternoon
here. Then I spoke rapturously of the
scenery, the silent glory of the place, and
the wonder of her flowers.
v her calm face rippled with de-
'gnt. Ah, get me talking of my flowers
and you get me talking indeed,”' she said,
and her faded eyes deepened so that they
looked almost like violets themselves.
“You are your own gardener?” I asked
then.
“That I am. My flowers are my friends
" they are about the only real company I
have.”
A question trembled to my lips. Was
she, in all this lonely land, living absolutely
alone?
She read the question in my eye and smiled
indulgently. “Oh, I am never lonely here;
they are very gay company, I assure you. I
am. creating an atmosphere out of my flowers
i ivi r. e imprests, you understand?”
I did not understand, but I smiled as
though I did. “You must give them a deal
of time and attention,” I said.
< * o- There was once a time when
I thought it my duty to give all my time to
my children”—she broke here with a faint
catching of breath, and glanced out through
the neatly-curtained window at the white-
frilled sea. “Then, after some bitter ex-
periences, it came to me that my children
would thrive better, perhaps, if I gave
them less arduous personal thought and care,
and surrounded them instead with gay variety.
While I was toiling and wearing myself to
a shadow laboring over them, it came to me
at last that a constantly-changing landscape,
like constantly changing social intercourse,
might benefit them immeasurably. What /
could not give them in a year of toil, my
garden would give them in one season of
living, breathing color.”
“Very wise,” I agreed.
She looked at me wistfully. “Have you,
may I ask, any children?”
“Alas!” I murmured, with my eyes
turned to the sea.
For a moment nothing was heard in that
little room save the beating of two woman-
hearts.. She broke the sympathetic silence.
“Well, who knows but that you are happiest
without them! Children are not always a
joy, not always a comfort. We give them
life, and they—well, sometimes they return
. I have had four,” she added.
‘We are in no hurry for tea,” I assured
her.
“Ah, then, perhaps, you would care to
hear about them. Yes, daughters. I always
felt they would be daughters. I chose their
names when I was a tiny mite myself, and
when I grew to womanhood they remained.
Hildas, Leocadia, Dawn and Little Clare.
There is little to tell of Hildas. She was
my first. I know now she was the misery
of the family. All I spent on her —time,
labor, money—all was sheer waste. You
see, a family is much like a litter of pigs”
—she laughed faintly here —“it does not
pay to feed the runt. Hildas, in a sense, is
now dead to me. I mean to put her from
my thoughts forever.”
She was gazing through the window; her
eyes w r ere still violet with mystery and
dreams. “Then Leocadia. There was some-
thing about Lepcadia that remains with me
always. I know now that she was not bril-
liant, not even clever, but she had a charm
—a charm all her own. Perhaps the secret
of the tragedy lay in the fact that I, and
I only, was charmed by her charm. How-
ever, Leocadia had her chance. I had my
chance through Leocadia.” She sighed
gently, but did not explain the tragedy that
had overtaken her second daughter.
“Yes. Then came Dawn. I put absolute
confidence in Dawn. Dawn must, and would
be, an immediate success; Dawn would do
for me what her sisters had failed to do.”
She sighed again, and I, looking at her,
supposed that her daughters had had ambi-
tions toward different careers.
“I put Dawn into the hands of Mr. Peter
Tarkham. I knew that lie was personally
delighted with her—indeed, he almost
accepted her himself.” I smothered a faint
gasp at the bare simplicity of this statement.
“But some little hitch occurred, I never knew
what. Anyway, he took Dawn to America.
New York, in fact.” I smothered another
gasp. “And I believe he almost got her
placed there. Ah, well!” She rose from
her chair and moved agitatedly about the
room, and tears shone in the violet of
her eyes. “Evidently it was not to
be. Mail after mail I had encouraging let-
ters. Oh, I grew so confident, so sure; I
even bought things, expanded a little, all ou
account of what Dawn was to bring me.
And then came the news —Mr. Tarkham had
died suddenly before he had been able to suc-
cessfully accomplish anything for Dawn.”
She paused, seated herself again, and fingered
some scarlet verbena in a vase beside her.
She pulled a cluster free and passed it to
me. “There is color for you,” she cried,
“Color ! Color ! Very little scent: but color,
mad color. It grips you somehow; it finds
the secret springs of being. Some folk tell
you that a heavily-scented flower will make
them feel wicked. I heard that remark made
once by a lady travelling in the same mail-
motor with me. I have always thanked her
for the remark, for it set me thinking.
Wicked. Wicked ! There was something to
be gained, so I argued with myself; not
wickedness in itself, but the sensation that
creates any emotion within us. We live in
an active age. We have done with dreams
and fairies. I wanted to live in an atmo-
sphere of movement, gaiety and passion—for
the sake of my children. We see no com-
pany here save stray picnickers, so I planted
the garden. In this way the living colors
about us in bloom and leaf supply the ever-
needful human interest.
“When I settled here some years ago—l
put all the money I had in the place—l came
principally for the benefit of the children.
I thought it would be such a beautiful spot
for them to be born in. But nov; I see it
was a great mistake. Children, any sort
of children, require more than just scenery;
if you want them to thrive, you must culti-
vate their emotions —scenery is not enough.
So I added my very gay garden to the wild
things about us, and little Clare was born
after the garden. And Clare has gained im-
measurably—oh, immeasurably—by the bril-
liance of the gay world about her. Clare
will do for me what her sisters failed to do.
I sent Clare to Melbourne first —but she re-
turned within a fortnight. They said she
did not suit. I could not believe that bald
statement of my Clare. She must suit. I
sent her awmy again: and again she returned
within a very few weeks. I did not despair.
I heard of a. certain Mr. Dillingford Cann
and wrote to him concerning Little Clare. In
reply I received a letter from one of his

Is a Bad Back

Making You Old ?
Is a dull, nerve-racking backache wearing you out —
making you feel years older than you are? Do you find
it hard to keep going—impossible to be happy or
enjoy work? It’s time, then, you looked to your kidneys.
A cold, chill or overwork may have weakened the kidneys
and brought on that nagging backache and those sharp,
piercing pains. You may have headaches, dizzy spells
and annoying kidney irregularities. Don’t wait until the
trouble becomes serious. Take things easier for awhile*
and strengthen the weakened kidneys with Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands.
They should help you. Ask your neighbor!
Mrs. E. Wilkinson, 29 Campbell Street, St. Peters, Sydney,
says:—'“For some time I suffered agony from lumbago-like pains
across the small of my back. These pains prevented me from
bending or getting proper rest at night, and seriously hampered me
when attending to my household duties. Sometimes I was so bad
that I could hardly move, and if I tried to get about the house the
pain was almost unbearable. After trying all sorts of remedies
without success, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under
my notice, so I got some, and they did me good almost at once.
After taking two bottles of these pills I was ever so much better,
and eight bottles completely cured me. That was twelve months
ago, and I have been well ever since. I always keep a bottle of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in the house and take a dose
occasionally, and they keep me in splendid health.”
Ten years later Mrs. Wilkinson says :—“I have been free from
backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me eleven
years ago.”

PEOPLE.
Mr. A. B. Cowell, Sutherland Street, Mascot, Sydney, says:—
“Some months ago I was suddenly seized with a terrific pain across
my back, just above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought
at first it would, but, on the contrary, it got worse, and I was soon
so bad that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled,
and even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain.. I
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in fact no position
was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected, being thick
and cloudy with a red sediment. I tried different remedies, but
they gave me no relief whatever. One day a friend suggested I
should take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and it proved to be
good advice, too, for three bottles cured me completely, driving the
pain out of my back, regulating the secretions and banishing every
other distressing symptom of kidney disorder. I feel splendid now,
and my recovery is due solely to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”

clerks saying he was out of town, and when
he returned my letter would be given to him.
I waited, no answer came; so 1 wrote again
to Mr. Cann. There came another letter
from one of the clerks saying they were sorry
they had overlooked my first letter, and that
Mr. Cann had just left the city on a long
agffs much-needed holiday.” She paused once
nmre, and as I looked at her I saw again
fhe dew upon the violets. "You can under-
stand by that time I saw what was meant —
Mr. Cann was dodging Clare. He had
heard of her, no doubt, from someone else
who had seen her, and he did not wish to
put himself to the trouble of having any-
thing to do with her. And yet I know, I
know, that Little Clare, of all my children,
is a child who deserves a place in the world —
a child who deserves to live.”
“Your daughter Clare is wishing to em-
bark on some career?” I remarked rather
nervously.
“Yes. Career, if you put it that way.
And I refuse to accept defeat for her. I
do indeed. There is my garden—there is
no defeat there! If my garden has not
brought about the exact results I hoped it
might, then at worst you can call it- only
a gorgeous failure. I feel that it must have
brought me something—must have brought
some good to Clare.”
“Indeed it bas,” I told her. “We saw
your gay company a mile out to sea, and
decided to come in and make closer acquaint-
ance. Are your daughters with you? Might
I meet them?”
For a moment her eyes searched mine with
an anxious deliberation, as though doubting
the advisability of bringing them forward.
Then, suddenly, she left the room.
When she returned she brought four large
packets and placed them on the little table
before us. She spoke softly, with little
catches of her breath breaking between her
words.
“No man has ever paid me the great com-
pliment,” she said. "This is the only sort
of motherhood that has ever been possible
for me. These are the only children I
have ever been able to have.” She pushed
the first of the packets towards me. “Hildas.
My first.”
It was the manuscript of a 200,000-word
novel.
She touched the second packet—the manu-
script of an SO,OOO-word novel. “My
second: Leocadia.”
She touched the third —the manuscript of
a 70,000-word novel. “Dawn,” she said.
“And this is my last: it is my shortest
and my best, Little Clare. A neat, manu-
script of 60,000 words, but I can get no one
in Australia to read it.” For a moment
her full heart overflowed, and a dewdrop
fell from the violets as she added. “You see,
the folk who deal in these things,” she
touched , the packets, “have, I believe, come
to regard me as a hopeless failure, and they
won’t even look at the things I send them.
Is that fair? Every man is given his chance.
Every woman should be granted her mother-
hood.”
“While you make the tea,” I said, recall-
ing her to the plain business of life, “I will
go for my husband.”
He was still lying there in the brilliant
sunshine, and I told him his tea was ready.
"We are to have tea in the garden,” I
said ; “and you are not to pay for it in the
ordinary way, but when we go you will take
with you the youngest daughter of the lady
of this garden.”
He blinked at me in dazed stupidity.
“Do you really want your tea?” I asked,
sweetly.
"Certainly, I do.”
“Well, you are about to meet that par-
ticular authoress I remember you spoke of
some months ago—l know you dodged read-
ing her last effort. Now you are about to
have tea in her garden. There is real in-
spiration in her garden—it must have pro-
duced something beyond just color. Any-
way, Little Clare was born among this color,
and now you are to give Little Clare her
chance.”
DOROTHY F. LANE.
The Bargain Sale.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ILIvS —dress material—ready-made
goods,” chants the liftman as we
shoot upwards. Women pressing
out to snatch bargains here allow others to
press in. I listen dreamily to his recitative,
broken only by arrivals and departures at
succeeding floors and the embarking and de-
barking of shoppers at these ports of call.
The lift is suffocatingly crowded and I am
in its farthest corner, obliterated by human
backs draped in georgette parti-coverings,
so considerable sinuousness is needed to
worm through when “Millinery—laces—
French flowers” is reached.
French flowers? Exactly! That is my ob-
jective—the objective of many earlier
shoppers also, judging by the crowd col-
lected beneath the overhead placards which
announce: “Bargainised French Flowers in
Exquisite Tonings.”
In the centre of that crowd are the tables,
upon which is displayed the artistry of deft
Parisian flower-makers, and the buyers are
already five deep. Never mind. What I
lack in force I possess in strategy, and soon
am in the front rank.
Who says that woman lacks the power to
concentrate? These women, from the flappers
to the forties, display concentration to the
uttermost in their work of selection. Pain-
fully intent they rummage among the rust-
ling flimsy things, swiftly selecting, dis-
carding, appraising and comparing. No
Prime Minister ever tackled affairs of State
with more concentration than is expended
by these in the building of some ideal of
beauty raised within the brain by these Bar-
gainised French Blooms at sixpence half-
penny.
As a first-ranker I concentrate also. My
hands are added to those already mauling
the goods. The goods are having a bad
time. I feel a throb of pity for th« poor
wilting things, victims of the fingers that
rake them over. Still, sentiment must go
when a blue dream of a dress is needed at
small cost for a ball. I need blue flowers,
and blue flowers I will have.
Unfortunately others, equally ruthless, are
demanding blue flowers; there is, in fact, a
“run” on the color. In the left-arm embrace
of earlier shoppers I see the blue grapes, the
blue currants and blue roses I feel should be
mine. Poor me —all I have found as yet
is a blue crawly flower that looks like a
spider, and a beetle which matches !
My dream of a blue frock begins, by sheer
force of circumstance, to turn chameleon-like
into a dream of lemon. Plenty of left-
overs in yellow. And I am a brunette.
Perhaps, after all, lemon would be better.
But those things are in tue lap of the
gods, really. We think w r e are acting on our
own initiative oftentimes when we are only
pawns of fate.
It must be so. Why else would the cosmos
of a shopper near me be mysteriously swayed
in my favor? It is thus. She has gleaned a
rich harvest of blue flowers and is about to
have them parcelled.
“Ten trails,” she says to the statuesque
sales lady—“that will be five shillings.” She
looks for corroboration, but the “sales”
makes out a check for five and five.
“How’s that?” questions the purchaser—
“ten at sixpence.”
“Ten at sixpence halfpenny,” answers
the other, in cool, crisp tones.
Amazement and horror at such profiteer-
ing sharpen the buyer’s voice.
“Sixpence ha’penny?” she says. “Why. I
thought they were sixpenny sprays. Why
don’t they mark them in plain figures?”
Her indignant attention is drawn to the
placard overhead. Confounded and annoyed,
she says, “Oh, well! I won’t take them then,”
drops her harvest of blue and departs—the
flowers well lost for fivepence.
Instantly they are mine, and iny color
scheme is restored. Quite plain it is that
Fate decided in my favor.
It is while searching for foliage to “tone”
that I make the acquaintance of the Ayoman
at my right. She is looking for fuchsia
tints. Had blue been her objective, friend-
ship between us would have been impossible ;
but, rivalry being absent, we become chums.
I. having a long reach, even glean purple
grapes for her from a distant box, and she
is grateful.
We both have all we need now, yet our
hands scratch and grope among the flowers
before us like the feet of fowls in a real
garden—sometimes the fingers interlock deep
down among the blooms, as though exchang-
ing the signs of some secret society.
It is during the final orgy of foliage-hunt-
ing that she tells me how it is that, living
in a distant suburb while “paying off a house”
and having a baby and two at school, with
lunches to cut, lino to polish and a lawn
to hose, she is yet able to attend a milli-
nery sale by 9 a.m. “It’s system,” she says,
“all system. If a person uses system her
house runs by clockwork and everything’s on
time.”
“Is it?” I ask. “Then my clock must be

ahead and do it.”
“Hoav lovely!” I murmur, .Avith the droAVSi-
ness of hunger, for I recollect now that the
sloAvness of my Japanese clock has sent me
out breakfast-less. In consequence, the
flower-garden before me is beginning to pail,
I am experiencing the doubt and disillusion
that inevitably follow a glut of anything,
from flowers to grand opera, as to whether,
after all, it is Avorth while. I even doubt
the blue color scheme now that I have tie
materials. I am often like that—go chasing
some chimera and sicken at sight of the
quarry Avhen I have caught it.
My neAv-found friend again takes up the
running. “Yes,” she says, “system is lovely.
I’ll tell you how I manage. First thing I
read the advertisements—while I’m feeding
baby, to save time. Then I make a list,

what’s worrying me noAV is Avhether to do

“You poor dear.’ she said, pityingly,

what she seems unable to find. Meanwhile,
her face reddens like that of any un-system-

is forced to own it. Disaster has blighted

Cutting Production Costs.
Cutting production costs means eliminating unnecessary expense; power
wasted in transmission is one of the heaviest of these expenses.
The efficiency of your machinery is the ratio of the work you get out of it
to the power you put into it; the work you get out of it governs your
production, yet you pay for what you put into it.
If the difference between these two factors is very great, it may be largely
due to the use of inefficient belting.
Consider, for instance, the possibilities of power wastage on a drive such
as that illustrated.
These leakages of power have been minimised, however, by the use of
PIONEER LEATHER BELTING,
which has now given perfectly satisfactory service over a long period.
The illustration shows 20in. Pioneer Leather Belt, transmitting 200 B.H.P.
Driving Pulley, 13ft. Driven Pulley, 4ft. Distance between pulley centres,
25ft. Length of Belt, 77ft. Belt speed, 2500 ft. per minute.
This belt replaced a similar Pioneer Leather Belt which had been in use in
Federal Brickworks, St. Peters, Sydney, for seventeen years.
