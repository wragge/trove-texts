Trench Poems
Givenchy Field.
The dead lie on Givenchy field
As lie the sodden autumn leaves,
The dead lie on Givenchy field,
The trailing mist a cerement weaves.
Abandoned, save for murder's work, •
A mine-shaft bulks against the stars,
And fast-receding in the mirk
The trenches show like umber scars*.
"All’s, quiet," the sentry’s message runs,
Out-wearied men to slumber yield;
The rain drips down the hooded guns,
All’s quiet upon Givenchy field.
H. D’A. B.
Without Shedding of Blood.
God gave us England from of old,
But we held light the gift He gave;
Our royal birthright we have sold,
And now the land we lost for gold
Only our blood can save.
Not till thousands have been slain
Shall the green wood be green again ;
Not till men shall fall and bleed
Can brown ale taste like ale indeed.
Blood and blood must yet be shed
To make the roses red.
For minds made vile, and blind with greed,
For sins that spread from sire to son;
For loss of honor, loss of creed,
There yet remains one cure indeed —
And there remains but one.
Malvern men must die and kill
That wind may blow on Malvern Hill;
Devonshire blood must fall like dew
*JI. lift, L Devon’s bays may yet be blue;
London must spill out lives like wine
That London’s lights mav shine.
Lord, for the years of ease and vice,
For hearts unmanned and souls decayed,
Thou hast required a sacrifice —
A bitter and a bloody price —
And lot the price is paid.
We have given all things that were ours,
So that our weeds might yet be flowers ;
We have covered half the earth with gore
That our houses might be homes once more;
The sword Thou hast demanded, Lord:
And, now, behold the sword!
Geoffrey Howard.
Back to Best.
A leaping wind from England,
The skies without a stain,
Clear cut against the morning
Slim poplars after rain,
The foolish noise of sparrows
And starlings in a wood —
After the grime of battle
We know that these are good.
Death whining down from Heaven,
Death roaring from the ground,
Death stinking in the nostril,
Death shrill in every sound;
Doubting we charged and conquered —
Hopeless we struck and stood,
"Now when the fight is ended
We know that it xcas good.
We that have seen the strongest
Cry like a beaten child,
The sanest eyes unholy.
The cleanest eyes defiled;
We that have known the heart blood
Less than the lees of wine,
We that have seen men broken,
We know man is divine.
Edward Melbourne.
The Shell.
Shrieking its message the flying death
Cursed the resisting air,
Then buried its nose by a. battered church,
A skeleton gaunt and bare.
The brains of soience. the money of fools
Had fashioned an iron slave
Destined to kill, yet the futile end
Was a child’s uprooted grave.

England.
Her seed is sown about the world. The seas
For Her have pathed their waters. She is
known » .
In swamps that steam about the burning
zone,
And dreaded in the last white lands that
freeze.
For Her the glory that was Nineveh’s
Is nought; the pomp of Tyre and Babylon
Nought: and for all the realms' that Cmsar
won —
One tithe of htrs nTcrc more than all of
these.
And she is very small and very green
And full of little lanes all dense with flowers
That wind along and lose themselves between
Mossed farms, and parks, and fields of quiet
sheep,
And in the hamlets, where her stalwarts
sleep,
Low bells chime out from old ebn-hidden
towers.
Geoffrey Howard.
From “Soldier Poets: Songs of the
Fighting Men” (Erskine Macdonald, Lon-
don).
'd*
To Galloway Kyle, of The Poetry
Beview, all lovers of poetry should be grate-
ful for the collection lie has so judiciously
made of the poems that have-come from the
firing trenches. Soldier Poets: Songs of the
Fighting Men (Erskine Macdonald; Is. Gd.)
is a brief anthology of those scattered poems
that have appeared in various English
papers, the unaccustomed spiritual outpour-
ing of men “shocked into poetry.” The
quality of this selection is extraordinarily
high; and remarkable features, not ad-
equately represented in the quotations above,
are the number and the quality of poems
that, in a swift reaction from the horrors
of war, deal with the dear home themes,
breathing the peace and the beauty of the
England for which these men were fighting.
And the collection gains an added pathos
from the fact that against so many of these
soldier-poets the editor has had to place thq
words, "killed in action.”
How to Write a Best-seller
Wouldn’t you like to write a best-seller?
Wouldn’t you just love to be the author of
“a masterpiece of fiction” and have over a
million copies of that mastei’piece sold in
the U.S.A.? They do that sort of thing in
America; and every month a literary maga-
zine, The Bookman, who ought to know
better, takes a vote of the booksellers, tabu-
lates the results, and acclaims one fortunate
novel as the best-seller. For the last two
months one novel has easily topped the poll,
and in consequence has had enthusiastic
adjectives showered upon it by all the
U.S.A. press. That book is When a Man’s
a Man, by Harold Bell Wright (The Book
Supply Company, per Sydney Book Club).
Apparently the Book Supply Company ought
to be called the Bell Wright Supply Com-
pany, since its paramount business seems to
be to publish and push the product of
Harold Bell Wright. It claims that of his
novels nearly 7,000,000 copies have been
sold. The Oregon Journal modestly re-
marks : “It is this almost clairvoyant power
of reading the human soul that has made
Mr. Wright’s books among the most remark-
able works of the present age”; the Phila-
delphia Dispatch notes that: “The secret
of his power is the same God-given secret
that inspired Shakespeare and upheld
DickenS”; while the Wright Supply Com-
pany contents itself with the simple deduc-
tion that: “The great heart of the reading
public is an unprejudiced critic.” Dealing
with previous novels by “this literary
genius,” “the wizard of American novel-
ists,” that famous literary critic, The
Grand Rapids Herald, terms one “the most
intense and dramatic novel of to-day” ; The
Nashville Tennesseean, famous through-
out the world for its literary judgments,
likens the perusal of another book to “listen-
ing to some magnificent organ played soft
and low by a master hand,” and terms the
author “the apostle of the wholesome.” The
Cleveland Plain Dealer characterises
another novel as “a twentieth century epic” :
another The Buffalo Courier sets up “as
a pure, white stone along a dreary road of
unending monotony” ; _ The Oregon Jour-
nal calls another “a literary gem that will
live”; and The Grand Rapids Herald “the
greatest story since Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Pro-
gress.”
-Now r , wouldn’t you like to have these
great organs of literary opinion say such
nice, friendly things about you? Well, all
you have to do is to write a yarn as good
as, but not better than, When a Man’s a
Man. It ought to be dead easy.
First, you must consider the public that
makes best-sellers. It is composed almost
exclusively of feminine readers, since the
TI.S. man is too busy becoming a millionaire
to be bothered with literature, except
those U.S. business men who are becoming
millionaires by writing best-sellers. These
females are city females, the sales-lady in
the stores, the idle wife living in a childless
flat, the lady who has nothing particular to
do between divorces, the stenographer who
means to marry a millionaire, the sort of
male who reads the society notes, the
flapper who hopelessly yearns for her ideal.
That is the public you must write for; and
it is a public that is w'orth writing for. Let
us analyse the ingredients that go to the
making of a best-seller.
You must carefully choose a title that will
stir in all those discontented feminine breasts
a great sex-longing; but it must not offend
any feminine prepossessions, Whem a
Bloke’s a Bloke would obviously be futile.
No stenographer wants a bloke to remain a
bloke: she wants him to become a million-
aire. And the stenographer, whose million-
aire is only to be found in the movies,
naturally turns to Harold Bell Wright to
provide the real article. And she is not
disappointed: every hero of a best-seller
must be a millionaire. That is Rule One.
As for the sort of novel you must write,
Harold Bell Wright kindly provides the
formula. It must not be a story springing
naturally from the author’s inspiration ; the
petting and plot must be deliberately chosen
with "a deep understanding of th* female
city-dweller’s yearnings. Wright admits
that he went to Arizona in order to. write a
cowboy novel; he found kind friends who
introduced him to the cowboy, and “patient
teachers” who taught him the knowledge of
ranching and rounding-up cattle, so plenti-
•fully besprinkled through, his pages. You do
not need to know anything about the West
in order to write best-sellers about it; all
you need do is to take a trip to Arizona and
pick up enough information to give the real-
istic illusion. Well, we have a West also,
and cattle-men that might serve as cowboys,
and you can easily manage an invitation to
an Outback station on your holidays. But
then you’re writing only for Australian
readers, and there aren’t enough of them to
make best-sellers worth while. But we have
a picturesque bloke Outback, the bushranger.
Why not utilise him? Out-of-date? No
more than the cowboy, and you see what
Wright can make of the cowboy. Think of
the lure of the cowboy in your girlhood; re-
member how he survives to this day in the
pictures; and then you begin to see that
I Wright knew what he was about when he
dusted up this old but valuable theatrical
“prop.” The bushranger is also waiting for
the Australian author who will oil its joints
and set it once more on the stage. So to
work!
Begin like this: “There-is a land where a
man, to live, must be a man.. . .It is a land
of far-arched and unstained skies, where the
wind sweeps free and untainted, and the
atmosphere is the atmosphere of those
places that remain as God made them —and
a man’s soul must be as the unstained skies,
the unburdened wind, and the untainted
atmosphere... .And in this land where a
man, to live, must be a man, a woman, if
she be.not a woman, must surely perish.”
Don’t be afraid of platitudes: Harold Bell
Wright adores them. This paragraph sets
the key of the book: it is wholesome, un-
tainted, virile, primitive; it breathes “up-
lift.” You must make it clear from the
first paragraph that there will be no sex in
the book, only sweet sentimentality. When
you’re after a big circulation you mustn’t
shock sweet 27.
Now for your hero. He must be a mysteri-
ous stranger, but you know from the fact
that he is “tall and exceedingly well-pro-
portioned,” and bears himself with “the un-
conscious air of one wh0.... etc.,” and his
person is “groomed with that nicety of
detail that... .etc.,” that he will turn out
to be a millionaire. (As nobody who reads
this page is likely to read Harold Bell
Wright, it may be stated here that he was
a millionaire.) It is also necessary to give
your hero fine lips that “curl in a curious
mocking smile.” Now for the cowboy. He
must be quite a nice sort of cowboy, the cow-
boy of the maiden’s dreams. In this novel
he is all that, and more. He is “the clean-
minded, gentle-hearted lad of the great out-
of doors,” with “natural delicacy of feeling,”
with “simple and primitive views of life —as
natural as the instinct which governs all
creatures in his God-cultivated world” —
whatever that means—with “unembarrassed
intelligence,” living “in close daily touch
with the primitive realities of life.” And
you must contrast this courteous cowboy
with the arid culture of our cities; you must
put into the. heart of Kitty, your flapper
heroine, a deep, passionate longing for the
futilities of universities and schools, and
you must get a boresome old cow-gent to
talk endless platitudes on the uselessness of
civilisation; and you must show your mys-
terious hero slowly unlearning all that he
has learned in the East, and finding himself
the ideal cowboy of the West. He had been
I but a millionaire before: now he learns what
it feels like when a cowboy’s a cowboy.
Arizona is quite a ladylike place. Harold
always remembers he is writing for the
innocent stenographer and the. neuter wife.
Everybody, including the villain, is strictly
honorable where women are concerned..
Harold does not allow any passion in his
lovers; there are no sex-discussions, _no
problems; what his million public wants is a
gentlemanly and ladylike love affair and
heaps of uplift. And you must be dull.
Harold’s hero talks to the simple Arizona
maid like a schoolmarm :
“All you seek is right here, waiting for
you to make it your own, and with it you
may have here those greater things without
which no life can be abundant and joyous.
The culture and the intellectual life that is
dependent upon mere environment is ; a
crippled culture and a sicklv life. The.jnjnd
that cannot find its food for thought wher-
ever it may be placed will never hobble very
far on crutches of superficial cults and
societies.” You must make your noble bush-
ranger talk like that. And when the million-
aire hero saves the girl he loves from death,
and she revives from her faint in his arms,
he immediately makes a speech'a page and a
half long to the poor thing. Above all, you
must be dull. Only in the last few pages
does this skilled author allow a little ex-
citement; and this is probably a concession
to the purchasers of the film rights. You
needn’t trouble about the end of your hero:
after you’ve dragged him through 350 pages
of wholesome uplift you can dispose of him
in a sentence. Harpld Bell Wright leaves
his millionaire cowboy on the skyline, appar-
ently contemplating some more uplift, or his
million feminine worshippers.
So get to work on the great heart of the
reading public. When a Bushranger is a
Bushranger! ....
Australian
According to ‘Lois,” author of Via
Nuova, or Science and Maternity (Dym-
ock’s, Sydney, 6d.), it is possible for a
woman to have a child without the usual
personal co-operation of a male. In a note
to her genteel story «he states that “the
maternity so effected has been stated on
the highest authority to be ‘perfectly prac-
ticable.’ The method to this end is well-
known medically, and is sometimes followed
in the case of a man and his wife whose
union would otherwise be childless.” Lois
forecasts a post-bellum period when the
State, in order to replenish the race, legal-
ises such a method of conception. Her
heroine, whose fiance had been killed in the
war, is too ladylike to have an illegitimate
child, and apparently she did' not get a
chance of marrying again. As far as can
be gathered from the vague statements of
“Lois.” certain healthy males were selected
to become fathers—once removed —to
healthy childless women, and the State
decreed that these scientific products should
be legitimate. Thus her heroine’s reputa-
tion is safe. When her marvellously healthy
boy is 12, his mother explains why he has
no father, and comforts the child with the
promise that, some day, “when you and I
shall have entered into the fullness of the
life beyond, where there is neither marriage
nor giving in marriage, we shall know your
father and share with him the certainty of
immortality.” It seems rather a round-
about and dreary method of having a baby.
But then, of course, the mother’s reputation
is saved.
J*
Alice Grant Bosnian, whose Miss Bryde
of England promised well, fails to bring that
promise to performance in her latest novel,
The Tower Wall (Tlodder and Stoughton).
This is an average novel, full of dull conver-
sation and with a theme that does not seem
to lead anywhere. It deals with an Adel-
aide girl who goes to England and there
meets a feminine novelist who is really her
mother, supposed to have died in France.
The heroine has been brought up by her
step-mother; and the real mother, unwill-
ingly coming to love her daughter, finds that
her place in the girl’s heart has long been
taken by the step-mother. Just when the
meeting between the two is.impending the
novel inconclusively ends. There is the
usual love-making, and a tremendous amount
of unilluminative dialogue, but no criticis'm
of life.

Corporal Cecil L. Hartt, A.1.F., wisely
got wounded in the leg instead of in the hand,
so, though incapacitated for further ser-
vice, he is able to utilise that clever Bul-
letin pencil of his to depict Billjim as he
knows him. Hartt’s Billjim is a grimly
cheerful bloke with a noticeable nose and
a rectangular jaw. Humorosities (Gordon
and Gotch. Is.), is a delightful book of car-
toons of Billjim, done with the slickness
and the humor that Bulletin readers know
so well. His “Withdrawal from Anzac”
aptly sums the situation: Billjim has just
given Abdul a jab on the nose, and is about
to deal him one on the chin when a General
bloke intervenes. and»Bill reluctantly hauls
off. Most of the cartoons show Billjim on
leave in London, and Billjim on leave in
London is worth patching.

“0. Henry” spent three years in gaol. His
latest biographer, C. Alpholso Smith, now
makes the first frank admission of . this
hitherto merely hinted fact. William Sidney
Porter, “O. Henry’s” real name, was a
cashier in a bank at Austin, U.S.A., and
was charged with embezzlement. “O. Henry”
always protested his innocence, and it is
admitted that the bank was wretchedly man-
aged. But on his way to stand his trial the
cashier got scared and fled to Honduras.
There he intended to remain, but the news
that his wife was dying called him back to.
take his punishment. But it was not the
evidence in his case that convicted him, but
his foolish flight to Honduras. He was
sentenced to five years. In gaol “O. Henry, ’
being a registered pharmacist, had charge of
the minor illnesses of his fellow prisoners..
Apparently he had plenty of time to write.
As the N.Y. Bookman says; “The-inefficient
bank clerk entered the institution; the story-
teller emerged.” There he got, first-hand,
many of the plots of his stories. The story
that' ultimately formed the play Alias
Jimmy Valentine had as its hero a fellow-
prisoner. From midnight, when his prison
work was finished, till dawn, “O. Henry”
wrote stories. “He had only two stories
rejected while he was in prison.” An
American gaol seems to provide the finest
forcing-place for literary genius; and those
three years in gaol were the greatest piece
of luck that “O. Henry” ever struck.
In reply to a correspondent who wanted to
know whether “Ginger Mick” was a real
bloke, a type, or an imaginary bloke, G. J.
Dennis obliges with the facts: “I suppose
you would call G. Mick a composite char-
acter. He is a memory, of several blokes I
have known; but I do not claim that he
is typically Australian. He’s just one of
the push; but has no living prototype so far
as I can remember.”

IMPORTANT.— LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

And How to Keep
them sound.
NERVES are the source of continuous worry to-day to some
people holding Civil, Military, Social or Commercial posi-
tions. When leaders of society, commerce, war, politics, or
other professionals, feel the strain almost to breaking point, the
nerves are found to be the weak spot in the chain of healthy life.
The ability and fitness to do things depend upon real good sound
nerves.
-stf
In volcanic times like these, when the nerves of the world
are on edge, the nerves of the individual often show their weakness
and give way.
* * & %
This is the time when the real,
One Great Nerve-strengthening Clements Tonic
should be taken and the nerves put right. For that it does put them
right, and quickly and permanently, is vouched for by such well-
known professional persons as Madame Brola, Miss Agnes Murphy
(Madame Melba’s biographer and secretary to the late. Quinlan
Opera Company), and others equally well known in the profession.
Tic -i#
Clements Tonic is a healer of the nerves. It strengthens the
brain that supplies power, and it helps to keep fit those who are lit
and healthy, as well as the one who is ailing and seeking health.
Do not be without this really good medicine. It does general good.
It is the advance agent of healthy life. When you keep it in a sense
you keep yourself insured against ill-health.

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect—the neglect of simple
rules of health.
all rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system ; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-

morning cleanses the system of excess uric acid, braces

Spinning your bobbins and fabrics free,
Fleet moon, sweet moon, into the sea ?
Turquoise and beryl and rings of gold,
Clear moon, dear moon, ne'er to be sold?
Roses and lilies, romance and love.
Still moon, chill moon, swinging above?
Slender your feet as a white bird’s throat,
High moon, shy moon, drifting your boat
Into the murk of the world awhile,
Slim moon, dim moon, adding a smile.
Tender your eyes as a maiden’s kiss,
Fine moon, wine moon, no one knows this —
Under the spell of your witchery.
Dream moon, cream moon, first he kissed me.

ZORA CROSS.
My Lady of Wellington.
Above the town among the trees I lie,
Drowsed by the languor of the lazy day.
The sun is lazy in a lazy skv ;
The land is lazy, and a bee goes by
In lazy way.
Beyond the dusky arches of the trees
The bay below is blue. The skies are blue.
The far faint mountain-peaks are mysteries
Of azure, and afar the lazy seas
Are azure, too.
And all the hills that queen it through the
town
Have cast aside their winter-cloaks of
green,
And now in filmy silks of summer-brown
Beside the bays thev stand, or stoop a-down,
Or 101 l serene.
And near to me my laughing lady lies,
Beneath a shade of resin-scented trees —
My tomboy lady ! But for once her eyes
Are dreamy, and for once she scarcely
sighs—•
Sly lady Breeze!
I ve been to languor-lands of sun and spice,
Where lazy odors 101 l along the air;
I ve even journeyed once, or maybe twice,
Over the slumber-seas to paradise,
And loitered there.
But Wellington out-drowses even these _
This day of dream; and under skies of
blue
I laze and 101 l in paradisal ease—
So long, at least, as yonder tomboy-breeze
Is lazy, too.

When We Grow Old.
When we grow old, and our good days are
done,
And that quick joy which thrilled through
every vein
Is dead ; and pleasure is worn smooth and
plain
As an old coin; and slow and slower run
The weary days that once had scarce begun
Ere they were memories; when our dreams
remain
No more that were so fair; and we are fain
To creep like shadows out of the bright
sun,
Doubt not our spirits that have loved so
well
Shall love and live together after Death.
I think some small wildflower will smell
more sw r eet
That your soul’s perfume haunts its azure
bell,
Feeling my kisses in the wind’s warm
breath,
That stirs the sleepy legions in the heat.

By the River.
Here where the moonlight lies along the
wave,
And little winds among the trees make
laughter,
We two may sit and chant the oldest stave
Of summer’s youngest song. .
Who recks in dreams about the morning
after? —-
The night is sweet and long.
The light moth-touch of fingers on my
sleeve!
Green eyes, red lips—how the warm blood
goes singing!
These kisses are too hot for make-believe.
Hid the moon wink above
To mark some of the Ten Commandments
swinging,
Hanged by the cords of love?
Hanged for their treason. Tried by oldest
law
That swayed before the birth of pale con-
vention.
The happy mcon those earlier summers saw.
Glancing blown boughs between....
Her lips are red ; and, did I chance to men-
tion,
Her eyes are very green.
Her voice has such a silver rise and fall,
Like pearls that ring on glass her heedless
laughter.
The pent world, like a great ox in its stall.
Is shut from joys too fine....
The moon rides high. A little cloud comes
after.
Her red, red lips are mine!

Australia Calls
for Economy.
With the continuing strain of the war, it must be evident to Every
true Australian that the less money we send out of the country for
foreign goods the less do we tax our own prosperity.
At a time when the call is for economy there is a double reason why
you should fit your wheels with
PERDRIAU
AUSTRALIAN TYRES.
By buying Perdriau Tyres that are Made in Australia you keep money
within the Commonwealth, which spells National Economy, and by
reason of the big mileages secured from Pordrians you keep money within
your own pocket, which spells Personal^Jbconomy.
We should be pleased to have you try a couple
of Perdriaus for comparison's sake.

PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY.
Woodrow Wilson inaugurated the biggest
naval shipbuilding programme ever attempted.
He knows that the United States must
henceforth be able to stand on its feet, to
return blow for blow and meet violence in
the only fashion which violence can under-
stand. His great battle-fleet is being
built for peace. It is to form a
part of the universal police force which
is to make a war of conquest unthink-
able, and bring the maddest nations of
the future to sanity. But would Woodrow
Wilson seriously put forward the claim that,
when the American armada sails forth to
punish the international criminal and arrest
the nation which attempts to murder
another, it is going to secure peace without
victory? If the criminal nation does not
surrender at sight of the policeman’s uni-
form, is the baton not to be used? Will a
drawn fight between the burglar and the per-
son who set out to arrest him satisfy the
ends of-justice? Wilson’s speech is a plain
declaration that he believes that to be the
case; and in the light of such declaration his
shipbuilding programme looks like raging
lunacy.
There is nothing new about the American
President’s peace ideas—except that they
are given forth at a time and under circum-
stances which rob them of force and mean-
ing. Any time in the last 20 or 30 years
France and England would have assented
to the main outlines of the doctrine. The
naval and military establishments of both
nations existed for police purposes only—
for the protection of their own lives and
properties first, and afterwards for the pro-
tection of their smaller neighbors. No war
of conquest would have been considered in
either London or Paris, however big the pros-
pective booty. Moreover, the association of
nations to maintain the safety of humanity
which the Yankee President foreshadows did
exist or at anv rate sprang very suddenly
into being, when, in 1914, the Hermans and
Austrians started out on a campaign of uni-
versal burglary. “Arrest those criminals!
was the cry of civilisation; and England,
France, Russia and Italy are doing tlieir
level best to get the handcuffs upon them.
That Wilson should now attempt to call a
halt and insist that the prisoner shall go
free and remain unpunished because he. has
so long defeated the ends of justice, is a
plain denial of his own doctrine of an asso-
ciated international police. Peace without
victory can under the circumstances have
no other meaning. Victory for the Allies
.simply means that international aggression
is dealt with as it deserves to he dealt with,
and that suitable punishment is meted out
to the wrongdoer.
* * * *
As for the fruits of victory and the.
aggrandisement of the policing nations, it is
certain that whatever price the Germans
are forced to pay, the debit on the side of
humanity must still be very large. Nor is
this the first offence of the marauders. Ger-
many has played the burglar before; Aus-
tria is a brigand with a long, record of
spoliation ; Turkey is an armed ruffian with
countless crimes to answer for. A Iren
they are at length arrested it is but reason-
able that they should he searched and have
tlieir ill-gotten plunder taken from them.
The former German possessions overseas,
which are now almost entirely in the hands
of the Allies, are not of such a nature as to
make their return any sort of moral obliga-
tion. Nowhere did the German Empire
colonise in any honest sense. The real
German colonies are to be found under the
American and British flags or in countries
like Brazil and Paraguay. Mans had no
enthusiasm about making a new home where
the Kaiser ruled. The German stations
abroad were either military posts or fields
for the exploitation of native labor and
trade. From a humanitarian point of view
there could be no possible gain in handing
them back to the temporary owners who
did so little with them. With regard to
certain territories in Europe and the portion
of Asia nearest to Europe, a certain amount
of adjustment has long been desired by the
peoples who live there; and if the war
brings that adjustment about, so much the
better for the world. That the Turk should
go out permanently and absolutely is not
merely a notion of his enemies. It is the
eager desire of all the subjects whom he has
misruled. The Slav portions ,of the Austrian
Empire would naturally link up with Rus-
sia and the Italian-speaking portions with
Italy. Bohemia should have the home rule
which her people have long demanded. The
provinces torn in recent years from Denmark
and France must be restored and every inch
of Allied territory now occupied by Ger-
many must be evacuated. This, coupled
with reparation for the damage done to
property in Belgium and France, is about
the limit of the demands of the Allies. Can
Woodrow Wilson see any “fruits of vic-
tory” in such a programme? If a burglar
who had committed murder and broken the
grand piano got off by merely paying for the
damage and handing over certain previously-
stolen goods, he might think himself par-
ticularly lucky. Even if in addition his
right to run a two-up school —equivalent to
the German rights overseas —were taken
away, he might still congratulate himself
pretty solidly. The Allies are not bent on
inflicting on the enemy the woes the enemy
is even now inflicting on others; but they
are bent on destroying his power to -do fur-
ther harm and making him realise that inter-
national crime does not pay. Wilson’s
talk of peace without victory is merely a
proposal to hamper the police in the dis-
charge of their duty; but, as he has nothing
to hamper them with except his soft tongue,
his latest pronouncement is naturally greeted
with the respectful laughter with which
the world is accustomed to greet the philan-
thropic schemes of its unworldly maiden
aunt —respectful laughter, through which
may be faintlv heard the hungry piping of
German cheers.
IRVINE WANTS TO STIR UP THE
FRAMES AGAIN.
Ikvine, Iceberg and all. is entitled to respect
for one thing, anyhow. He has made a
definite statement of where he is and what
he means. A man who does that, whether
his programme looks wise or foolish, seems
to this paper to have a much higher concep-
tion of his duty and a greater dignity than
the man who substitutes trickery for candor.
Frankness is a quality which no Australian
in these days can afford to condemn, for its
absence among the people entrusted with the
administration of the nation’s business has
paralysed the Parliament of the Common-
wealth and is corrupting the political in-
stincts of the people.
Ikvine explains himself this way :
No coalition or alliance —call it by the name of
National Government or any other name one chose —
that had not a clear and definite policy for the
.conduct of the war as far as Australia was concerned,
had any right to come into existence. Further, he
could not support any alliance that had not in the
forefront of its policy the determination to _ again
make as early an appeal to the people as possible to
seek authority to use the whole strength of Aus-
tralia, both in manhood and resources, in the prose-
cution of the war.
While The Bulletin has respect for the
straightforwardness of the policy, it has no
faith in its success. For many years this
paper tried to persuade Australians that
some day they must fight for life. And it
never shrank from the consequential duty of
telling Australians that when the day did
come voluntary service would fail them.
When the struggle that now imperils the
future of Australia with terrible reality broke
out in Europe, this paper pleaded with Par-
liament to adopt the only course reconcilable
with prudence and sanity. Hughes and
the other little men jeered in reply. What
took place later can easily be remembered.
That fatal campaign of blither and blunder
was beset with incidents, and had a conclu-
sion which cannot be disregarded now. The
answer was definite. What justification is
there for supposing that it would be different
to-morrow? This paper knows of none. On
the contrary, it is regretfully compelled to
say that since the vote was taken the con-
duct of Parliament and the administration
of the Defence Department -raises a strong
presumption that the vote would be much
more hostile than before. It is not u bit of use
being afraid to look at the truth, even though
it be distasteful. To start the wrangle going
again now would cut the country up into
warring camps, make the existing untidiness
more untidy, stop all recruiting, and make
Australia look more ridiculous than before.
Is it worth while to do this—for nothing?
Though the Liberals might conceivably gain
some party advantage in a few States at a
general election —still, would it be worth
while ?
* * * *
Even those people who imagine that the
community might now vote “Yes” can hardly
suppose that the majority would be wide
enough to make conscription a practical
administrative policy. The best that can be
hoped for now is that as many recruits as
can be obtained for the reinforcement drafts
shall be enrolled, and that the citizens of the
Commonwealth, instead of hearing an inter-
minable cackle about “winning the war,”
will see all this loquacity turned into action.
There is plenty for public men to do even
though they confine themselves to the
limited material with which they have to do
the winning. Mere hot-air on the subject is
turning the whole business into ridicule.
Irvine says that people do not grasp the
immensity of the dangers. Obviously he
ought to be at large, helping them to do it
and making them as wise as he is himself.
Hughes talks in the same strain —and goes
to the seaside for a week or so. Wars are
not won by men going to listen to the sad
sea waves. Cook occasionally exhorts the
readers of the morning newspapers to do
their duty and enlist, and follows this up
with long rigmaroles about “negotiations”
with Hughes —all of which is about as use-
ful a contribution to the job in hand as
blowing out matches. Meanwhile the busi-
ness of securing the material that will actu-
ally help to win the war is left to others,
and the cost of it is ruinous. Can all these
people not arrive at some understanding
about what they can do to assist in holding
Australia’s end up, and proceed to do it?
THE PERILS OF IMPORTING.
“Straightwike” sees a nightmare with a
parable in its tail: —
The yarn about old age being the result not of
fleeting years but of attacks by bacteria on the
cells of the body is serious. Australia should arise
and awake. The national destiny is in danger.
We must take precautions. All over the world
Science is patiently at work tracking down bacteria
and, by removal of one lot, giving others a chance
to get a living; and one of these days some patient
investigator may hapiien on the animal now brows-
ing on our innards and creating functional changes
which lead even those citizens who dodge motor-cars
inevitably to the - grave. Menschikoff, the Rus-
sian bacteriologist, reckoned he was getting close
to . the animal’s tail and recommended a diet of
sour milk as a prophylactic against its ravages.
There was something wrong with this, however,
because Menschikoff pegged out in the usual way
while older men than he survived on corned beef
and cabbage. But the quest of the creature
evaded by Methuselah goes on.' And when it is
found? Well, if the nation where the mystery is
solved is properly organised and is long enough
in the head, the world will be its oyster. This
importing mania of ours leaves us in a position
inviting an inoculation that would throw the under-
takers out of employment and make grave-digging
a forgotten art.
Already this momentous discovery may have been
made. Concealed in the next shipment of potted
meat there may be myriads of bacteria that will
devour this age-creating enemy of mankind. Some
emissary of a foreign Government may even be
preparing to set up a breeding establishment on
the premises and. hand the live stock round . in
buns and lollies and headache-tablets. The Bureau
of Science, or whatever it is that Hughes was
talking about, is unable to give any assurance
that this is not the case. It slumbers behind a
barricade of red tape, leaving the nation to meet
its fate. .Tust consider what may happen through
Australians being suddenly deprived of the habit
of growing old.
Everyone now at or over the age of 40 or so
would begin to look as if he was 25, and go on
living for ever. There would never be any relief
from Hughes or Joe Cook. George Reid would
at once come home. Holman would flourish for
all eternity. The man of 375 would be liable
for military service, and girls of 416 would be a
regular thing in the drink shops. Mere kids of
30 born in 1989 would be leading to "the altar
brides who were in long skirts away back in 1902.
Darcy would be filling the Stadium in 2364 when
he had a return fight with Dave Smith. Hugh
D. Mclntosh would in the Legislative Council of
2024, then numbering 87,643 members, be pas-
sionately urging the reimposition of the amuse-
ment tax and the abolition of Sunday newspapers
in the interest of the churches. All of us who
are alive to-day would be talking for 500 years
about amending the Constitution and tearing up the
I.WAV. by the roots and the triumphant inaugura-
tion of an era of cheap fish for the people. We
would talk with the wisdom of the ancients and
the clear vision of little children. Of course there
would be difficulties. The Liberal policy of
abolishing the old age pension might have to be
adopted, and the matter of the baby bonus
given careful consideration; otherwise this great
experiment in social amelioration might bring the
nation to ruin. Enlightened legislation on the
birth-rate would meet the case, though it is just
possible that after men and women had reached
(say) 175 they would voluntarily agree to self-
denial. Anyhow, a woman who had reared children
for a century and a half would have no kick com-
ing from me if she left the business to her great-
grand-children. Nor could anyone be seriously
angry with a man who, after rearing 124 children
in a four-roomed cottage, said he wanted an aeon
or two of peace before he went in for any more.
But it is just here that the danger to Australia
exists. All these miscellaneous horrors could per-
haps be endured, but behind them all would be
stalking a terrible Nemesis. Fed for centuries by a
cunning enemy on age-abolishing organisms, the
country would in time become inhabited by millions
of people wrangling over the conscription vote and
party government—with an army composed of
centenarians drilled to a state of high efficiency and
a navy manned by men who were grandfathers in
the days when men were buried. The sudden
cutting-off of the dope would of course be followed
by an immediate bolt of Nature to her old ways of
doing things. Bereft of the antidote which kept the
destroying bacteria in subjection, within a night—
even while Randolph Bedford was writing another
article whooping up the Australian climate —
Calamity would stalk through the land and Time
cut wide swathes in the population, commencing
where he knocked off in the long ago. Men who
went to bed feeling as if they were 27 would wake
up in the morning to find their hair had fallen out
and they were 524. Women would shrivel into
mummies. Co-respondents in the Divorce Court
would wither like trees struck by lightning. The
white ant and the dry rot would be everywhere, and
while the S. M. Herald and the Argus urged the
proletariat to face the position firmly so that con-
fidence might be restored, chaos would brood over
the land and law and order cease to exist. Con-
stituted authority would expire by effluxion of time.
The John Hops would be gathered up and removed
to hospital by kindly-disposed chauffeurs. The Judges
would expire under their wigs, the army and navy
perish wherever it happened to be., There would be
nothing happening but funerals, and the people who
had just commenced to live would rush from the
stricken land as if pursued by fantods and dingoes.
Then would the world know that Australia was a
continent that had been visited by the Wrath that
was to come, and Cohen would drag out his securi-
ties and sell them in London and Amsterdam as
curios at 2d. a dozen. The war that Australia
thought was peace would be over, and the people
in the distance who had suddenly cut off our dope
supplies would emerge from the laboratory, and, in a
spirit of discreet silence despatch about 16,000,000
of themselves to take possession. Having kept their
mcutlis shut while they prepared from generation to
generation to capture Naboth’s vineyard and do it
only after Naboth and his family had destroyed
themselves by consuming imported bacteria, great
would be their reward.
Is Parliament going to face this problem of how
to save Australia —to counter science with science?
Can we get into a position of security by using
the referendum or something? Or have we to sit
down and just wait to see if we get it in the neck ?
Someone ought to explain. The situation is critical.
I haven’t noticed King O’Malley looking any older
the last five years. That is very ominous.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Metal Goods We Wouldn’t Make.
Some of the sins of the past come home to
roost in the moulting season. That Aus-
tralia should require to import steel, brass
or copper is manifestly absurd. We raise
the metals or their components in this con-
tinent ; and to confess that we cannot manu-
facture them is to place ourselves on a lower
level than the tribes which inhabited Europe
before the Christian era. Those tribes could
make steel for their own use, and their pro-
genitors four or five thousand years earlier
could hammer copper and cast bronze; but
we, the heirs of civilisation, with all our
votes and brag and decaying hope, must get
our supplies from the people whom we arro-
gantly profess to regard as our inferiors in
civilisation! It is the fine work of
our tariff-sinking politicians that thus
degrades us to the level of savages whose
achievement is still in the stone age. As a
plain fact we can make all the steel, brass
and copper goods we want in Australia; but
our manufacturers haven’t been encouraged
to do it. The insane doctrine that we should
attend to the raising of’primary products for
an overseas market and leave all finer human
effort and craftsmanship to foreigners was
solemnly preached by the Freetrade, anti-
Australian crowd from which men like W.
M. Hughes never broke away. With
Federation we got a kind of tariff; but never
one that could really protect our factories
and the craft-workers’ pay-sheets. Now,
when a big war is on. we find ourselves in
the muddy and shameful position of being
compelled to weaken the Allies’ munition
supply and so aid the Kaiser by our demands
for the metal goods that for years we should
have been making in Australia. Even tw r o
and a half years after we have been at war
we still so far loaf on the Allies for these
supplies that the British Minister of Muni-
tions has been compelled to tell us that we
can have no more except, practically, for war
purposes. It is one more evidence of the
solid basis of German calculations. Wil-
helm knew well enough the unflinching, back-
ing he had with British and Australian
importers; and even though the war has
killed the main contentions of Freetrade. the
effects of the ancient poison remain.
To a Finish!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now blows the trumpet! All that went
before
Was but a skirmish on war’s outer skirts.
We have not heard the cannon’s loudest
roar ;
Its previous spurts of fire were nothing
more
Than trials, as of some young bird that
flirts
A feather ere it soar to loftier flight.
Now are the armies mustered knee-to-knee;
And Heaven and Hell and all eternity
Shall see a fight.
Stand firm, stout Teuton, yours must be the
. shock!
You asked for battle and the thing is here!
Be steadfast as the grey of granite rock
If this tremendous doom you hope to mock;
For now, at last, has come the trial year.
The wide earth shakes in thunder-dazzled
night;
And Potsdam, Frankfort and the Northern
main,
Through floods of death and bitter storms of
pain,
Shall see a fight!
The Russian points flash in the frosty sun,
A hundred leagues of valiant, charging hate;
The Western Front flames like a single gun,
As large as France and loaded black with
fate;
And close behind its surging deaths there
wait
The gathered ranks of Britain’s new-made
might.
The hour has struck! The omens all are
fair.
Prince, duke and Kaiser, if they will and
dare,
May see a fight.

A Chapter in Voluntaryism.
It is a common assumption that voluntary-
ism served Britain’s purposes admirably
until the present war. But the rottenness
of the “Go if you please” system was fully
proven 60 years ago. During the Crimean
War-
Lord Raglan wrote home by every despatch-boat
for more men and food and ammunition, but first,
last, and most emphatically for men. They sent
him boys. They could not help it. The news
had reached home of how the troops were faring
at the front, and only boys who knew nothing of
the meaning of war could be induced,to take the
shilling. Raglan wrote again for men—full-grown
men who could stand exposure. But there were no
men to send him.
England was scoured for recruits. They dragged
the slums of Manchester and London and drew them
blank; mealy-mouthed recruiting sergeants were
sent into the country districts, and into all the
poorer parts of Ireland ; posters proclaiming the need
for men and the glories of military service were
displayed in all the market-towns, and the country
folk stood round in crowds and laughed at them, for
even they knew. There were barely a hundred
recruits forthcoming as the result of the campaign.
And Raglan wrote again for men.
Six Cabinet Councils were held in one week, and
every single Minister had a foolish, fatuous plan of
some kind to relieve the situation. Some were
tried. A Bill was rushed through Parliament
authorising the Government to raise recruits in Ger-
man!/. Recruiting agents were sent, and the country
breathed again for an interval, hoping against hope
for results. But the German* peasants showed no
more eagerness for this kind of thing than the
English, Scotch or Irish had done. A few joined,
but not enough to fill even one troopship, and it was
not considered worth while to send them; they
were paid for the few weeks’ drilling and dismissed.
And Raglan kept on writing home letters, hitter
letters, for men.
The newspapers that had all along backed tip the
Government, began to harp to another tune. Cabinet
Ministers backed and filled, trying to feel the trend
of public sentiment, and ready to advocate peace
with dishonor the moment tlie mol) seemed ready for
it.
Australians who still cling to voluntaryism
may see in these passages to what depths
their inefficient system may drag a nation.
England scoured the slums; postered the
highways; even sent to Germany begging
llans and Michael to lend a hand. Unless
we hold fast to compulsory universal ser-
vice the day may come, too, when Australian
recruiting sergeants will comb the slums of
Calcutta and Colombo, Hong Kong and
Nagasaki, imploring the Asiatic to lend us a
hand to defend our country. And when we
have done that and failed, Cabinet Ministers
will make peace for us with dishonor. And
indeed, in such circumstances, what else
could they do?
Hangin’ Back in the Breechin’.
“Two Seas” : My ignorant friend
“Tracker” (B. 18/1/’l7), who writes of
the necessity for discouraging the farmer from
loafing, evidently hasn’t studied the Abo.
columns, otherwise he wouldn’t allude to
the “ififernal go-slow disease gnawing at
CocKws vitals.” That unhappy fowl has
always been referred to by indignant rural
workers as a “blanky cow, too blanky swift
at heating the sun in the morning, and too
blanky slow at downing tools in the even-
ing.” whilst the Government day-laborer
watches him at work with speechless horror.
If the Government laborer was handed
.Cocky’s return for such a week’s work he
would drop dead. “Tracker’s” creation,
John Sheepskin, farmer, convicted under
the “Go-slow Prevention Act,” wasn’t
allowed to make any defence. Had he been
heard, the daily papers would have published
the case this way :—-
FARMER ACQUITTED.
Prosecutor Placed in the Dock.
John Sheepskin, farmer, charged with not making
a living wage, elected to give evidence on his own
behalf, and was duly sworn.
Accused stated that he purchased a farm on a
Government subdivision. It was 16 miles from rail.
At the time he purchased it a survey to the nearest
railway connection had been made. This induced
him and others to take up the land ; but the line
they were promised had not been commenced, and
was not likely to be. He had grown a great variety
of crops in his endeavor to find something that
would show a profit, but had failed. High freights
and cartage, high wages, extremely low prices for
everything he had to sell combined with a hundred
per cent, increase upon everything he had to buy,
left him no surplus over the cost of production. If
the manufacturer had to pay more for his raw
material he either raised his prices or ceased to
manufacture. No one blamed him for doing so;
but the farmer couldn’t pass the increased cost of
production on to the consumer, and if he threatened
to cease producing at a loss he was denounced by
the daily papers as an unpatriotic worm. He
had grown Swede turnips last season and sent two
one-ton lots to the Sydney market. Without count-
ing his labor, seed, horse-feed, cartage to rail,
etc., the railway freight and agent’s charges de-
ducted from tiie gross proceeds left only' five penny
stamps, which were returned by the agent with the
remark that Sydney was fed up with turnips. He
tried growing beans. The “Soil” columns in the
Lily papers informed him that Sydney was perishing
for the lack of beans, and showed with a few
strokes of the pen how farmers could make enor-
mous profits by raising beans instead of fooling
about with turnips. Manure for beans had jumped to
£lO per ton and the seed to 30s. per bushel, but
he put in a few acres hopefully. The first crop
was destroyed by a late frost that the pen-and-ink
farmer hadn’t provided for. He ploughed the land
again and put in a second crop. It was a heavy
yield and he had to employ outside labor to pick.
He paid the pickers Is. per bushel. When he
started carting the beans to the railway he had to
rise at 2 a.m. to get two loads in before the goods-
shed closed. He got notice from his agent that
they were a beautiful sample, but as no one seemed
to want tbem he had to accept 6d. per bushel to
get rid of them. He then discharged his pickers
and ploughed the balance of the crop under. Hear-
ing that cabbages were scarce and dear in Sydney,
and reading in the daily paper that about 16
thousand could be grown on an acre, and that at
10s. per dozen farmers would make a handsome
profit, he was induced to give them a trial. The
first load he sent down returned him 6d. for the
lot. The second load met a really bad market, and
the agent sent him a bill for 15s. to pay the
balance due for charges and commission. He then
bought some starving cows and turned them into
the cabbage patch. Presently he intended to put
on sheep. He would be able to do without employ-
ing labor then, could spend some of his time in bed
and make a decent living. Growing things that had
to be carted 16 miles to rail was no good to him,
he wanted something that would walk there. Yes,
he had heard that the Government was putting
returned soldiers on the land —very expensive land
too —to grow fruit and vegetables. It seemed to
him a severe punishment for what they had done.
Growing anything but live stock was a bigger gamble
than betting on horse-racing. The wowsers ought
to prohibit farming. He started with £lOOO and
was now £l5OO in debt, , and had never had a
holiday, or spent as much upon himself as any of
his employees. If the Government would return
him the money he paid for his farm he would be
glad to get out and take a Government job, as he
was tired of work.
At this stage the Judge discharged the accused
with a few words of sympathy and ordered “Tracker”
to be placed in the dock and charged under the
War Precautions Act with talking through his chest
about a subject that is barred to outsiders. Only
daily paper farming experts are permitted to in-
struct farmers how to run their business. Their
stuff is the only humorous entertainment that the
men on the land can afford.

Right of Way.
That most of the' drivers of motor-cars and
all the persons who run light sulkies and
other discordant vehicles through Sydney
streets should be put on their trial for
attempted murder, is a proposition to which
the pedestrian population would most cheer-
fully subscribe. That all the rough riders
of the Post Office should be immediately
hanged is, of course, mere axiomatic truth.
During 1916 there were about three street
accidents per day in the Nark State’s capi-
tal, and of these 81 proved fatal. It is a
had record, and one which has filled even the
police with concern ; for it means that things
are almost as dangerous in Sydney streets
as in places where the European war is
enjoying its winter calm. The point which
wants to be most impressed on the driver of
anything that goes on wheels is that the
man on foot has the right of the street.
The notion may have started in the days
when the hefty Saxon invader of the Cold
Country mostly used his boots for locomo-
tion, while the timid and conquered Ancient
Briton had a chariot or two to drive jn ; but,
in any case, it is a good democratic idea,
which lives by divine right of its inherent
sound sense. If there is not room in the
streets for vehicles, then the vehicles must
stay out. There is any amount of scope for
driving anything you like at Port Stephens,
Jervis Bay, Goff’s Harbor and Twofold Bay.
If Sydney has too much traffic there are
other ports in N. S. Wales which can absorb
the surplus, if only the politicians will let
them. To insist, then, upon all vehicles of
every kind entering the city being numbered
and licensed might lead to rapid reform and
real decentralisation. Let the number of
licenses he limited to the capacity of the
streets, and no additional licenses granted
under any circumstances; and even the most
enthusiastic congestionists might begin to
wonder if it mightn’t be worth while having
another city or two along the coast. At the
present rate of growth, the time is not far
off when the daily traffic will kill or maim
most of the people who are not squeezed to
pulp in the overcrowded trams.

Firesticks and Custom Duties.
Fifteen years ago seeds of the Austra-
lian black wattle were sent to South
Africa. At that time Australia had an
export trade in tannin. Now Australia
imports heavily from South Africa, where
the wattle is grown as a field crop _on
land capable of producing maize. In ‘the
meantime the demented policy of burning
down the Australian tree had been in full
blast, and thousands of acres of black wattle,
which in parts of this country grows like a
weed, have been destroyed. The result is
that shiploads of tan-bark have to be brought
into Australia from oversea, and the tan-
ners are yelling against the import duty
of 30s. a ton on what is a raw material of
their industry. The whole business is
another revelation of the wooden-headed
policy that has been pursued with respect
to Australian forests. Undgr any reason-
able system of conservation this hideous
waste would have been impossible and Aus-
tralia, in addition to supplying her own
tanneries with a product locally grown,
would have bark to sell. The influence
of the duty has been practically nil, nor
could it be anything, else. Where public
policy is directed to ensuring the destruc-
tion by lire of the natural sources of supply
of any commodity, the imposition of a duty
to keep out imports is manifestly only a
second symptom of lunacy. It bears a
close resemblance to the project of stopping
the importation of wheat by sending round
a commission to burn up the crops. Reck-
less forestry has been responsible for what
is occurring in the leather-making business.
The thing is disgraceful. Regeneration is,
of course, still possible, but only by giving
up the habit of destruction. This is really
not a fiscal question; we merely have to
decide whether the resources of the country
are to go up in smoke. If the Australian
tree is to go, then the duty is merely a tax.
If it is not, the need is more for an intelli-
gent handling of the wattle-bearing forest
areas than for a duty that protects nothing.
What is the Matter with Hogan?
The demented system of officially decorating
places and things and institutions in Aus-
tralia with the name of an individual
addicted to a cocked hat was advanced a
further stage in N. S. Wales last week.
Stirred at last from a somnolent acquies-
cence in the destruction of the Australian
tree, the Government some time ago deter-
mined to establish a school of forestry, and the
undertaking is to grow up in Hogan’s Bush,
near Gosford. A start was made by laying
a foundation stone and having the custo-
mary feed, incidental to which it transpired
that, “by way of compliment to the Gover-
nor,” the surrounding vegetables would in
future be officially known as the
Strickland State Forest. This seems
like commencing with an act of vandalism.
What has Hogan been doing? Ever since
the beginning of things the bush has been
known as Hogan’s. Around that patrician
name local history has slowly gathered until
if seemed likely that in the course of cen-
turies, unless the trees were not burned
down in the meantime, Hogan’s Bush
would to the Australian begin to have the
dignity of Trajan’s Column to the Roman
of long ago. And now this chance of having
Hogan embalmed in the records of the
nation and fixed on the landscape has been
destroyed and the name of Strickland,
that is merely associated in the public mind
with a rooster’s tail, substituted. Heaven
knows what is going to be the fate of
Hogan’s pub, but if that is torn up by the
roots as well, all the old landmarks will be
in danger. Why this mania for sprinkling
Australia with the names of Governors, who
are forgotten five minutes after they tear
themselves away—who are not Australians
nor of Australia and would object to be,
anyhow ; whose whole status rests upon the
fact that they are outsiders, mere birds of
passage? Hogan was good enough before.
It ought to be good enough to stick to.
Wilson’s Professional Army.
Woodrow Wilson favors a standing pro-
fessional army as against an armed citizen-
ship. The announcement has a quaint flavor
suggestive of half-ripened peaches or some-
thing that has not been allowed enough sun
and air. If the big European war has
proved one thing more than another, it is
the hopelessness of depending upon a small
number of highly-trained men to do the work
of a nation. England had such an army.
In the first clash wit!) Germany that army
covered itself with wounds and glory. It
tried hard; it failed splendidly: it is now
dead or incapacitated. Man for man the
British soldiers of the defunct standing
aimy were probably better trained and
more capable than anything which could be
brought against them. On that superiority
of training England had for years been
staking her chances; and had her army
succeeded the notion of conscription would
have been killed dead. It did not succeed
for the good reason that the opposing enemy
could have walked it down by sheer force
of numbers. Had it been 10 times as big
and equally well trained it would have had
a sporting chance and no more than a sport-
ing chance. But the cost of maintaining a
professional army 10 times as big as the
original British force, and maintaining it
through years of profound peace, would be
such as to stagger the boldest political
financier. Wilson’s proposal is probably
to keep up an establishment just big enough
to be practically useless while costing th*.
maximum His country is willing to pay. For
a less price he could have an armed citizen-
ship strong enough to meet any emergency;
but you can't arm and train the. hustling
citizen without interfering with some of
the hustling citizen’s money-making plans;
and as that means political enmity,
Woodrow Wilson isn’t the man to do it.
The amazing thing is that he should con-
sider any sort of army necessary. If “Peace
without victory” is his motto, why trouble
about soldiers? A nation only has soldiers
in order to win victories; and if it doesn’t
want to win victories, why not hire a few
comic-opera companies, if it must hire
somebody ?

Tiie beneficent influence of Sydney, thought-
fully constructed by Nature, according to
the Sydney dailies, to be a boon and a bless-
ing to men in all other parts of the State,
doesn’t look as beneficent as it should when
one travels inland. Almost all towns within
easy reach of the beneficent influence are at
least as backward as they were 25 years ago,
and most of them are more backward. Dirty
and dejected, they seem to have lost all
heart, and to have settled down to a hope-
less, drab dreariness. To see bright, up-to-
date, prosperous little places you must get
two or three hundred miles away from the
beneficent influence—down in the Riverina,
or up in the North, well on the way to
Bananaland. It is then that you find towns
that look as if they enjoyed living, and in-
tended to keep on living as joyously as possi-
ble. No doubt the Sydney dailies could ex-
plain the anomaly, but to an unprejudiced
observer it looks as if the further you get
away from the city that gobbles most of the
national production and chokes with loan
money, the less its beneficent influence hurts.
And if, supposing these faraway centres,
instead of having to buy and sell everything
through Sydney, could skip down to the
nearest port on the long coastline, the bene-
ficent influence should be less hurtful still.
But this, of course, would mean putting the
great decentralisation policy of every N. S.
Wales Government into force, and that
would never do. What’s the good of a policy
if you put it into force? You only have to
invent a new one.
*
From a court table: —
I hope that idea of a Bananaland Minister to
institute a separate court for women turns out to
be catching. One of the most mournful spectacles
afforded in the city police courts is the procession
of girls and women pushed along to take a turn with
the daily crop of male thieves and drunks. Of
coursfe it matters little to some of the women.
They are in the pit. But even as to these is it
worth while making them feel more degraded? With
others the process is the refinement of cruelty. Any
number of fairly decent women come into the courts
ou trifling charges, and the Law ought to deal with
them in a cleaner environment than where justice is
handed out now. If something- were done to keep
the premises clear of the frowsy individuals who
witness these court proceedings a not inconsiderable
step would be taken towards this reform. The other
day I saw a young- girl charged with getting money
by a false pretence. It was a flimsy charge. It
should never have been laid. She was wholesome and
decent —and she followed on the roster two ruffians
who with a female decoy had robbed a drunken
sailor. The push that enjoyed one case heard the
next. The girl was discharged; but that quarter-
hour in court was a harder thing to bear than the
charge was to meet. The community had, of
course, every right to put the girl on her trial.
But what right had it to submit her, innocent, to
the exquisite pain of such an inquisition ?

In 1910 Solomon Feingold, of Jerusalem—
name and title of splendid sound —established
The Truth newspaper in the city of David.
It was a polyglot journal devoted to the
interests of British imperialism; and when
the Turk got angry Solomon had to take
a hurried flight to Egypt, where, from the
capital of the Ptolemies, he still wields a
dauntless pen. But the hour will come, lie
tells The Bulletin, when the “Anglo-
Palestine Commercial Intelligence Agency”
will be affiliated with “The Jerusalem Com-
mercial Enquiry Offices”; and then the
founder of these institutions, from his long
experience in Palestine as merchant, journal-
ist and newspaper proprietor, will be prepared
to give any desired information regarding
the boundless potentialities of the country.
Now that the Australian troops are
approaching a point where a march on
Jerusalem may be expected to begin,
Solomon’s message of hope rings like a
bugle-call. Here is the most thrilling para-
graph :—-
Imbued with a firm conviction that the star of
the bloody Hohenzollerns and the ill-omened crescent
of the Ottomans are soon, yea, very soon, to be
totally eclipsed by the Sun of Righteousness, and
that the final restoration of Palestine is not far
hence, we shall be much obliged if you will kindly
send 11s a catalogue of the articles you manufacture
for exportation, which catalogue and particulars
attached thereto will be alphabetically filed and
registered in our books for future reference, when
we re-enter Palestine and resume our interrupted
commercial and industrial enterprises.
Thus patriotism, commerce and prophecy
follow the fortunes of the Australian Light
Horse ; and Israel returns —with a catalogue
of Tasmanian jam and Queensland bacon—
to the Land of Promise.

“X.Y.”: “Ses” (B. 4/l/’l7) refers to the
failure of the tobacco industry in Aus-
ti alia. He says that in 1861 there were
11 factories in N. S. Wales. Much de-
pends upon the definition of a “factory”;
but if it be taken to mean an establishment
in which raw leaf is converted into com-
mercial tobacco there were at -least that
number of factories at work in one river
district on the lower North Coast, and pro-
bably quite as many, if not more, in the
lower Hunter district, in the ’sixties and
’seventies. The American war put the
industry on its feet. This state of things
continued until the early ’eighties, when the
industry was killed by log-rolling poli-
ticians. These small local factories pro-
duced a good, sound black tobacco from
local-grown leaf exclusively, and it could
be bought retail, from the local store-
“Eureka.”
Randolph Bedford’s contribution :
Is The Bulletin’s contributor “Die Mini” only
perverse in his attitude to Eureka and the Ameri-
can War of Independence, or is he impudently con-
temptuous of facts? The American War of Inde-
pendence was among the most just and patriotic
in history; the doctrine of “no taxation without
representation” was only one of its causes. There
was that arrogance toward the mere “Colonial”
which has always distinguished the English in their
rfile of colonisers. Their idea of “colonisation”
was to sell all sorts of convicts and political
prisoners as slaves, and to drive out of England all
the democrats who were too big or too numerous
to be imprisoned. They repeated the foolishness
in Victoria, trying to govern with an ignorant and
arrogant bureaucracy men who were the salt of the
earth —the best malcontents of the world; malcon-
tents provided by the rotten conditions of a Europe
that isn’t civilised even yet.
In Australia it was the rottenest of times. The
native-born were styled “currency” by the imported
idiots who called themselves “sterling.” England
was well on to its job of helping Germany to a
Navy; Victoria was prattling that “we must be
good to Prussia,” while the Prince Consort bleated
at the opening of the Crystal Palace in
ISSI that such exhibitions would be “a guarantee
of berbedual beace.” Political opinions were as
dull and stodgy as the literature and furniture of
the time: a wowser’s respectability grafted on to
the superstition of a “ruling class”; a witless,
heartless treatment of the poor which persisted up
to the time of this present war. And “Die Mini”
is surprised that such dullards came into collision
with the pick of the Old World leavened by the
forty-’niners of California !
Proof that Eureka was regarded at the time as
just and successful lies in the fact that the British
Government prosecuted the leaders for treason and
couldn’t find a jury to convict; and the indictment
charging the prisoners “that they did levy and make
war against our Sovereign Lady the Queen within
that part of her dominions called Victoria and
attempt by force of arms to destroy the Govern-
ment then constituted and by law established and
to depose Our Lady the Queen from the Kingly
name and her Imperial Crown” was laughed out of
court. Yet that was just what they did try to do ;
and the people applauded them. For instance,
Melbourne Argus on July 1, 1854, printed this by
Gerald Massey :
“Aye, it must come! The tyrant’s throne
Is crumbling with our hot tears rusted.
Ye robber villains, pause no longer,
Ye cannot stay the opening day—
The world goes on, the light grows stronger,
The people’s advent’s coming.”
The Argus did that, although on the following
November 8 it permitted George Allard to write
advocating that a German prince should be made
King of Victoria !
Less than a month afterwards Peter Lalor and
his men blew out tire chances of a Kingdom of Port
Phillip for ■ keeps, it was the most cosmopolitan
fight for Freedom ever known: Irish, French,
Italians, Poles, Germans, Yankees, Canadians,
Spaniards, Scotch, English, Nova Scotians —and
more Irish than any. And while, they thought they
had lost they had won. Eureka works as leaven
in the mass of- Australian thought. Liberty sprang
from the bodies of the 20 mates who died on
Massacre Hill.
Imagine the digger of to-day called up from wet
shafts half a dozen times a shift to show his license!
The men of Eureka believed quite rightly that
nature put the gold where it was, and that the one
license necessary to dig it until they were repre-
sented in Parliament was the license of manhood,
strength, hope, energy and stout heart. They
demanded a House of Representatives and a Senate,
payment of members, manhood suffrage, short Parlia-
ments, a citizen soldiery, taxation of property, and
an absentee tax. We have them all to-day, and those
Eureka men 50 years before their time were better
Australians than many of us. They knew what they
wanted, and none of it was unreasonable, and they
enforced it by the sacred right of insurrection. It
was the Eureka of 1854 that gave us the liberty
of 1916, and not the least of its virtues was the
blowing into space of the “loyalists,” represented by
George Allard, who on November 8, 1854, wrote in
Melbourne Argus advocating the accession of a Ger-
man Prince of the Kingdom of Footscray, Ballarat,
Melbourne and other Dominions appertaining to the
Victorian throne.

keepers, at from 2s. per lb. The produc-
tion of leaf was a very profitable business,
although only carried on as a side-line to
the production of maize. It entailed a large
amount of light labor at planting time, as
the seedlings had to be shaded during the
day, and the shades had to be removed late
in the afternoon, in order to let the plants
get the benefit of the heavy dew. After
about 10 days of such treatment the plant
grew more vigorously than any local weed,
and that is saying a good deal. With
plenty of shed room, harvesting and curing
were mere child’s play. The price for leaf
ranged between 9d. and 18d., the average
being about Is. or 15d. All this profitable
work was brought to an end by the Stuart
Government in 1884, when, in order to raise
revenue, it was proposed to put a further
shilling on imported leaf. Alex. Stuart
was the head of the Government, and he was
also the largest importer of American
leaf. He would not agree to a further
impost on imported leaf unless the local
product was also taxed. ' The result was
an excise duty of Is. 3d. on local leaf.
Even with this impost the small manufac-
turers could have carried on by passing the
tax on to the smoker, but the excise regula-
tions killed them dead. Each manufac-
turer had to pay a license fee proportionate
to his output. Even that could have been
endured; but it was also necessary to keep
an excise officer on the premises, and to pay
his salary—minimum £5 per week. We
could not only grow all the tobacco smoked
in Australia, but also supply half Europe
as well, and we should have been doing
this long ago but for bad government.
The writer has grown all varieties of leaf,
from the finest Turkish up to large Ameri-
can varieties, the plant of which grows 7ft.
high, with lower leaves 15 inches long and
proportionately broad.
The War and the Wasting Assets.
The German submarine, deadly though its
work has been these last few months, is not.
the sole cause of John Bull’s feverish
activity with spade and plough. The
economic strain is becoming so terrible, the
difficulties of payment abroad for essentials
so great, that every pumpkin and bushel of
wheat and rasher of bacon grown on the
premises represents a little done towards
achieving final victory. Every country
engaged in the war is undergoing an
economic siege, and the one that can hang
out longest is likeliest to win. Bonar
Law, who succeeded Francis McKenna as
Chancellor of the Exchequer after the poli-
tical earthquake in London, thinks so very
definitely. Speaking in the House of Com-
mons on December 16, he reviewed the
finances, and after expressing the view that
it was impossible to grasp the meaning of
the figures, went on to say :
It would never have been possible to make arrange-
ments for this war to go on indefinitely, as the
Napoleonic wars did. Everything has had to be
thrown in. It will be obvious to every member of
the House that the armies now embodied by our-
selves and our Allies cannot be kept at the present
figure indefinitely. All that can be hoped for is that
they will be kept strong enough to beat our enemy.
In finance we cannot hope to go on on this scale,
though I believe we can go on long enough.
And following him McKenna :
The demands upon us are enormous. There is,
too, one severe restriction with which my friend will
become only too well acquainted—the restriction
that it is not easy to convert sterling wealth into
dollar wealth. We have to pay in dollars for what
we buy now, not only in America, but all over the
world. We have to buy the whole mass of imports
for ourselves and our Allies with cash —in dollars.
So while Australia is waiting to see what
happens in the Spring it may do it no harm
to remember that the preservation of the
Empire’s resources is a long way more worth
thinking about than yarns concerning the
emptiness of the German pantry. And it
occurs to this paper for about the 165th
time that if some of the Australian politi-
cians who merely blither about winning the
war were to bend their minds to overhauling
the Commonwealth’s expenditure, they
might achieve something of value to the
nation. We want a new war-cry—the con-
servation of our resources. To pretend
patriotism and at the same time bleed Eng-
land for loans for non-essentials is wicked
hypocrisy; and almost every Australian
Treasurer is doing it. Nor is it anything
but wicked hypocrisy to pretend patriotism
and at the same time weaken the Empire’s
resources by importing from the foreigner
any thing at all that is not urgently neces-
sary. These things have to be settled for
in cash. Even if the foreigner does buy
our goods, at this time we need not take
payment in his goods. If he does not pay
in goods he must pay in cash ; and that is
what the British Treasurer wants —cash for
use in purchasing those war essentials which
can’t be got otherwise. There are plenty of
other ways of helping to win the war than
by the securing of recruits. The women,
in particular, might be of great assistance in
this equally necessary campaign of economy
—an economy which doesn’t mean spending
eighteenpence instead of two shillings, but
does mean increasing home production and
cutting foreign purchases to the bone.
One point not to be overlooked with re-
gard to the present voluntary campaign is
that there is no age limit to service. The
campaign is a double-barrelled affair. The
Government is after coin ag well as men,
and the person oygr 45 who has lost most
of his hair and found more flesh than he
wants can do his bit by enlisting some of
his coin. It is an easier way of obtaining
a substitute for the firing-line than was
allowed during the American Civil War, and
is more profitable than catching wild cats
or purchasing scrip from Ikey MacSliort-
odds. The Commonwealth is asking for
£18,000.000 for eight years; it will take as
little as £lO in weekly instalments, of five
shillings, and pay over 41 per cent, interest;
Seeing that the loan money will be used for
war purposes only, it is up to the patriot
who can’t go to the Front to go to the bank.
It should be a matter not only of interest,
but of principle, too.
Balfour, in a recent despatch to Presi-
dent Wilson, said : —-
The Young Turks, under German influence, are at
least as barbarous and far more aggressive than was
Abdul Hamid.
Yet it isn’t' so long since Andrew Fisher
and Mahon, of the Labor party, met at a
banquet given by the . Syrians in Melbourne
to commemorate their incorporation with
the Young Turk party! Heaven knows
whether Syrian or German money paid for
the refreshments, but it was a generous
banquet, anyhow. The most eloquent of
the speakers (Fawaz, M.A.) claimed some
credit for the Young Syrian Turks on
account of their racial relationship to Jesus
Christ. That was how the Young Turks
came to be adopted by the Kaiser, no doubt.
The Huns are the own people of Gott, and
the Syrians are the brethren of Jesus Christ.
Melbourne Board of Shirks went picnicking
to Sorrento the other day with a few
friends, and at the ceremonial feed at the
local pub the toast of “The King” was
enthusiastically proposed and as enthu-
siastically honored —in lager beer ! The
bottles that decorated the tables were
labelled; “Beck, Kaiser Brewery, Bremen”.!
God save the King! If God doesn’t, it
seems, on the whole, a pretty bad look-out
for him. We own traitors enough to sink
50 kings.
Last week, an officer having been
arrested for fraudulently drawing other sol-
diers’ pay, the police prosecutor said that
there was evidence of misappropriations
exceeding £50,000. Whether this man is
guilty or not, the Department long ago had
proof that its pay-office system was rotten ;
yet apparently that system wasn’t improved.
Not only was the system rotten, but in at
least one case the Department adopted the
meanest of all possible dodges to cover up
the internal peculations: the money having
been paid back after the original cheque
had been abstracted, the Department in-
vited the person who had been robbed to
sign a document confessing that he was
receiving a second cheque, the first having
been lost or destroyed. As The Bulletin
lias urged again and again, the whole finan-
cial side of the Department should be over-
hauled by two or three competent commercial
men.
Here is another illustration of the large
capacity of the Federal Government for
keeping men who want to go to the Front
from getting there. Fred Whitehead, of the
Melbourne Herald, having enlisted, was
about to start training, when he was re-
quested to resume his pen and boom the
War Loan on behalf of the Treasury. No
doubt Whitehead can do this job; but it
could be done just as well bv a hundred men
who for one reason or another can’t get
to the Front. It has been precisely the
same in the camps: eager men have been
held back for weary month after month for
the simple reason that they were good
clerks —though there are a thousand other
equally good clerks among the hundred
thousands who are not good enough physi-
cally for the Front.
In a Melbourne police court recently a
lawyer punched a learned brother on the
nose for calling him a liar. If this sort of
thing is permitted we will soon hear of one
baker assaulting another for accusing him
of selling bread.
The ancient Maitai, formerly the Miowera,
done for at Raratonga recently, was a
favorite target for Sam Smith, the early
Labor M.L.A. That splendid battler tor-
pedoed many a coffin ship ; but his charges
that the “Weary Mary’s” boilers were in a
dreadful state were blown out by Govern-
ment-appointed investigators. Still, it
wasn’t till the ship’s name had been changed
that Sam’s remarks were forgotten. Calum-
niator and victim, the ending of both was
tragic.

It’s a long way to old Samaria from the
White City (Sydney), but the track can
be followed. When Saul was “making
havock.... entering into every house and
haling men and women, committed them to,
prison,” Deacon Philip got a stand in the
city, performed miracles and brightened up
things generally. “And there was great
joy in that city” (Acts viii, 8). To-day it’s
the Kaiser who is making havock and Deacon
Eslick is the prophet who is cheering up
the halt and the lame, and those who have
done their bit on the pony course and others
sore distressed and fed up. And there is
great joy in that city, too.

The tail of the Passing Show will dis-

will be carried on by a specially selected co.,
headed by Australian comedian Fred Bluett
and Malcolm McEachern, the Sydney bari-

Lady Sen Mei.
After a long season at the Garden Theatre
(Sydney) the entertaining team of Dandies
is packing up its joyous sextette and other

duced Fox drama of Russian peasantry.
At Melbourne Royal the story of “The
House of Glass” continues to utter its
solemn warning to young women who fall
in love with chauffeurs at first sight and
accept their evidences of sudden wealth as
guarantees of respectability. Also the
drama is repeating its message of hope to
all such unwary spinsters. Even though
they suffer two years’ imprisonment for
their faith in a “crook” sweetheart they
may turn the incident to good account by
escaping to another locality and marrying
a railway manager under an assumed name.
This is made possible to Margaret Case
(Florence Rockwell) by the fact that the
cold hand of the Law grabs her crook sweet-
heart and her guileless young self ere they
have been made one. She owes a lot to
the Law, like most other girls who are
unjustly convicted in melodrama. It saves
her from getting hitched to the chauffeur;
it takes her to Kansas City to capture
Harvey Lake; finally it compels her to tell
her husband the truth about herself. Which
being done, her husband has no trouble in
getting Governor Patterson to grant her a
free pardon for the crime which she didn’t
know anything about. Since the first night
Greenaway has taken the place of Edwin
Lester as the Gov. who just drops in and
makes tilings pleasant, but there is no
apparent necessity for having anybody in
the part. It could ’just as well be played
by an imaginary voice speaking through
Harvey Lake’s telephone. The result would
be just the same. After hearing what her
husband said to the Gov. through the ’phone,
muddled Margaret would express much
gratitude to her friend the plump lawyer.
And her gush would be just as unreasonable
as it seems at present.

After three weeks of “She Stoops to Con-
quer” there will be a violent change of bill
at Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday. The
incoming tragedy is “The Bells,” last played
at Her Majesty’s during the Irving season.
Allan Wilkie will appear as Burgomaster
Mathias, the citizen whose otherwise blame-
less life was marred by his haunting
memories of how he once murdered a Jew
for the sake of his money.

At Melbourne King’s the days of Dooue
as O’Shea are numbered. That slim and
mild exponent of Irish heroism is about to
undertake the character of Tom Moore,
which Andrew Mack introduced to Mel-
bourne some years ago. For this occasion
Maggie Moore and H. 11. Roberts will join
the company, and Costumes will have an
important place in the programme.
At Melbourne Majesty’s the proof of the
panto, is in the greeting it continues to get
eight times a week. This week offered
opportunity for an extra matinde, so the
number of greetings will be nine. One of
these days there will be a performance by
kiddies only, all the grown-ups standing out
of the cast whilst the nippers and young
flappers turn their precocity to imitations
of their elders. But it may be remarked
that, as far as Coleman’s scene painting
and the costume color-schemes are con-
cerned. the panto, would be just as charm-
ing if it had no cast at all.
The Follies at Melbourne Tivoli are much
the same old unbroken string of puerile
happenings. One forgets them in detail
and forgives them in the mass. Vaude and
Verne brought their patter into the pro-
gramme last Saturday, but Belle Oliver and
Bluett are taking their talents out of it.

Olga Petrova is an eminent member of
the Purity League in her latest revelation
at Hoyt’s Melbourne Theatres. The film,
“SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER ,” AT
MELBOURNE PRINCESS'S.
Jeremy , the servant
(Henri Dorc).
"Walter Hunt as
Hastings.
entitled “The Soul Market,” shows Olga
spurning the dollared devotion of the cus-
tomary sinner for the fresh young love of
a social “hit,” who, though usually dis-
guised as a god, is temporarily posing as a
humble chauffeur. A motor smash first
throws the pair together, but the hero has
to do two reels of abasement at his divinity’s
feet before he can make the collision per-
manent. The beauteous Virginia Pearson
is the star of the Fox specialty, “A Tor-
tured Heart,” and Bessie Barriscale is
another Hoyt heroine who drinks like a
drunkard from “The Cup of Life.”
“Ramona” vanishes from the Melbourne
Auditorium screen to-morrow. On Satur-
day, commencing at the matinee, the sheet
will be a thing of joy, with Annette Keller-
man as the leading allurement in the big
spectacle, “A Daughter of the Gods,” the
filming whereof consumed eight months and
made William Fox one million dallahs
poorer.
How Adelaide lias decided to regard
“Damaged Goods” may be judged best by
the fact that the play is prominently on
sale at the Methodist Book Depot. The
boom of its production at the Royal con-
tinues, and it is publicly blessed by politi-
cians, preachers and physicians. The acting
is sound, though the doctor’s harangues are
(doubtless with kindly intention) delivered
at terrific pace; but acting is not what
counts in this dramatic sermon. The
Tivoli is opening again with an Ander-
sonian revival and the old racecourse play,
“The Chance of a Lifetime.” The Majestic
brings back the good old Steele-Payne bell-
ringing crowd ; also George Wheeler extracts
music from odd objects, but the bluffer
Brown carries a fiddle and never plays it.
The jolly open-air Dandies are contemplat-
ing the end of their summer season, and a
team of genuine Anzacs (mostly from
N.S.W.) have given a good concert —which
provides a hint for other returned soldiers.
President Wilson’s suggestion of “peace
without victory” seems to complete the
ancient prophecy that there will be wars
and humors of wars.
An instructive story of how this war was
rushed by Germany is E. J. Dillon’s dis-
closure of the method adopted in Berlin
to scare the Russian Government into issu-
ing a mobilisation order. Premature news
of German mobilisation, having been issued
by a servile organ, was permitted to be
promptly wired to Petrograd' by the Rus-
sian Ambassador. But the Ambassador’s
subsequent wire, stating that the announce-
ment had been contradicted, was not allowed
to go at once. It was delayed for several
hours by a suddenly-created German censor-
ship. Thus Germany in general was de-
luded into the belief that the Kaiser had
been forced to mobilise the army as a counter
move to the Russian order, whereas it was
the Czar who had been inspired to issue the
order as a counter move to the mobilisation
in Germany. A similar manipulation of
the telegraph service was accomplished by
Bismarck in 1870, whereby the more artless
Germans of that period were persuaded that
their aggressive Fatherland had been forced
to take the defensive against French aggres-
sion.
AT POVERTY POINT.
. “L”: The death of Louis Waxman in
Melbourne last week calls to mind how
opportunity knocked at the door of his bro-
ther, professionally known as Albert
Whelan. During the run of “The Belle of
New York,” in Adelaide, Oscar Girard fell
sick and died. The management, fearing that
Ichabod’s absence from the cast might seri-
ously interfere with business, sent Whelan
on in his place. The Australian was a per-
fect mimic in those days, and gave a first-
class impersonation of Girard; so good, in
fact, that the public was unaware of the
change until Girard’s death was announced.
Thereafter Whelan never looked back. The
firm gave him his chance, and he grabbed it
with both hands.
The exit of Julius Knight from Australia
recalls one of his entrances. Beaumont
Smith went down to interview him. During
the conversation the then scribe told Knight
that there was a rumor in Australia that
he padded his legs. Knight was furious.
“Absurd !” he said. “Why, I go 15$ around
the calf!”
Robert Greig and his wife (Beatrice Hol-
loway) will soon be off to America. Most of
their Australian stage experience of late has
been in ’Murkan plays, in which Greig re-
ferred to bis fellow men as “guys,” and the
lady combined the “smart” mental charac-
teristics of a Yankee typiste with the soul-
ful sentimentalism of a baby doll. So they
can hardly be going to America as ex-
ponents of Australian method or manner or
in search of a new point of dramatic view.
Greig has a fair chance of becoming a
specialist in bulky Yankee personality parts,
and even his un-Australian fatness seems to
suggest candy and maple syrup.
“0.K.”: Methinks “Harrison O.” doth
protest too much reverence for the old Eng-
lish comedies, lie suggests that a manager
who plays them with interpolated gags
would approve of a scene-painter touching-
up a Corot landscape, or a ragtime musical
conductor putting new stuff into a Puccini
opera. The comparisons are preposterous.
Tony Lumpkin, in Goldsmith’s “She Stoops,”
is not such a delicately humorous character
that “H. 0.” need turn pale with indignation
when the illiterate bumpkin misreads “Dear
Suuirt” for “Dear Squire.” The gag is what
Goldsmith doubtless would have put into the
situation had he thought of it. “H. 0.” talks
as though the gagging of these old comedies
was done by scene-slnfters and stage-carpen-
ters. Instead, a lot of good brain-work has
been put into the revivals of classic plays
during the past 50 years, and the consequent
additions and alterations, which have stood
the criticism of first-class producers, will
withstand the criticism of “H. 0.,” snarl he
never so doggedly. The “gagged” version of
“Richard III.” has held its own against the
unadulterated Shakspeare play for nearly
200 years, anyhow.
“THE HOUSE OF
GLASS,” AT MEL-
BOURNE ROYAL.
Bob Greig as Mr.
McClellan enjoys
a fag.
“Glen Huntly”: There is seemingly no
limit to the vanity of the actor person. In
its notice of the Allan Wilkie production of
“She Stoops to Conquer” Melbourne Herald
protested against the gagging and sug-
gested that “Mr. Wilkie could well afford to
dispense with the few laughs called forth by
these impertinent interpolations.” Where-
upon Wilkie sent a letter to the press
announcing that he was not “catering for an
audience of dryasdusts,” and mentioning:
“At least nine out of every ten of the
laughs w T hich are heard throughout the pro-
gress of the play are evoked by the gags.
Without the gags and business introduced
the play would not run three nights.”
You will never get Hamfat to admit that the
author of the play may be partly responsible
for the tears or laughter of an audience—he
is only responsible when the show is a
failure! Wilkie’s principle appears to be to
use Goldsmith’s name to lure people to the
theatre and then give them something that
Goldsmith was never guilty of writing. If an
ordinary tripe merchant did this the Pure
Foods Act would be put info operation.
Beaumont Smith has finished his first
him. It is an uproarious comedy entitled
“The Hayseeds.” His next effort will pro-
bably be a version of Ethel Turner’s “Seven
Little Australians.”
‘ Cockaigne”: Exit Mrs. Billington,
mother of the stage, aged 92. First appear-
ance, ’57, as Venus, in “Cupid and Psyche,”
at the Adelphi. Celeste was the original
Mrs. Cregan in “Colleen Bawn,” but only
acted it a few nights. Her French accent
was rather absurd. Mrs. Billington then
took the part. In later years she was much
associated with Mary Anderson. Her hus-
band came to Australia with Toole, who left
her a pleasant whack of coin.
“Lou Par”: One of the best things about
the entrance -of the Famous Players-Lasky
people into Australia as producers is that
they are .appealing to Australian authors
for scenarios. Alec Lorimore, who repre-
sents the concerns, redkons that mouldy his-
tory has been done to death in the movies,
and is not profitable. He therefore warns
Australians not to worry about Australia’s
grand-dad, but to submit modern stories
that will have the same appeal in England
and America as here. For which thank
Heaven and Lori-
more ! The writer
who tries to foist
busb.rariging yarns
on to an unsuspect-
ing Yank deserves
to be hit on the
head with a Chaplin
mallet. Australia has
been misrepresented
enough in some of
the diabolical films
already turned ou t
in this country.
Fred Bluett looking
for laughs, Mel-
bourne Tivoli.
“0.K.” : The demonstration in honor of
Allan Wilkie on the anniversary of his
first appearance at Melbourne Princess’s
was a really remarkable testimony to his'
success as an actor and stage-manager.
Nobody had heard of Wilkie and his wife
when George Marlow introduced them to
Melbourne. The theatre had come to be
thought of as a temple of brainless bello-
drama with a following of rorty blokes and
donahs. The idea of giving ’em Shakspeare
at popular prices was treated as a joke by
.T C.W. people. But Wilkie “got there”
right away with “The Merchant of Venice,”
of all plays. His wife’s Portia was the
least effective of all the things she has done,
yet the performance as a whole gave the
season a good start. Incredulity came
along to be convinced by “Othello,” “Ham-
let,” “As You Like It” and “Twelfth
Night” that Wilkie was a forceful actor
and fine Shakspearian schoolmaster. Pro-
bably a boomsome revival of “Romeo and
Juliet.” at the end of the first season was
not a good advt. for the return season.
The gloomy old love story attracted a lot
of people who hadn’t seen the co. to better
advantage in other plays, and these new
patrons were not enthusiastic, as a rule.
If they have lately seen versatile Wilkie
and his leading lady in Sheridan and Gold-
smith comedies or in “Richard III.” they
have doubtless forgiven them for having-
been a lot less entertaining in “Romeo and
Juliet.” Anyhow, the reputation of the
dramatic goods which Wilkie offers at bar-
gain prices 4s bound to grow in size like
a rolling snowball. Unwilling people of the
vaudeville order of mind are induced to
sample the show for the first time, and
some of these become converts and enthusi-
asts. ’Midst the tumult of applause on
Wilkie’s anniversary night the hallelujahs
of recent converts were distinctly audible.
“J.F.H.” : Tenor Joseph Tapley is pleasantly
remembered by Australian music-lovers, but
few could give his present address. Some-
body wrote recently to a London ''theatrical
weekly asking about it, and the editor re-
plied that he last heard of Tapley from Aus-
tralia, and presumed he was still there. A
Canadian on furlough, seeing this, reported
that Joseph had settled down as a farmer in
Ontario.
The sprightly infants whose song and
dance are a feature of the Firm’s “House
that Jack Built” are to be given a chance to
show that the principals are no better than
they should be in their parts. For years
past the youngsters have been indulged with
a private show which has been given to an
audience of admiring mothers and the theatre
staff. But this year they are to have a
matinee public performance all to them-
selves, when the whole of the pantomime,
including ballets and the special turns intro-
duced by the grown-ups, will be given. It
should be an entertaining afternoon. The
receipts are to go to the Melbourne Chil-
dren’s Hospital.
“Jean S.”: Ada Reeve, making a dash to
Japan and the Straits Settlements via
Egypt, is caking a company headed by
Clarence Blakiston, the trim actor of un-
certain age who was Nell Stewart’s leading
hand on her farewell tour two or three years
ago. Blakiston portrayed two types of kingly
frivolity in “Sweet Nell” and “Du Barry,”
and was apparently overcome by. his royal
splendol 1 . Subsequently, however, he re-
vived wonderfully in a modern atmosphere
with Charles Milward and Muriel Starr, and
furnished two or three nicely-etched studies
of the sort of young Englishman who seems
to be the joint product of Oxford and the
Tailor .and Cutter.
“Rustler” : The other night at the J.C.W.
panto. I saw a little man toiling upstairs to
the gallery carrying an immense book, which
on investigation I found to be the Family
Bible. I wondered what on earth he wanted
with this book at such a place, and marked
him down as a religious crank. Everything
was explained when he sat in front of me
on the Bible, and obtained an excellent view
of the show, but completely blocked it out
for me. I’d heard many a time of the Good
Book stopping a bullet from entering the
heart of the better young man ; but this is
the first time I’ve seen it employed as a
periscope.
(Continued on Page 42.)
Concerning the most modest man in Aus-
tralia :
John Shirlow, the Melbourne etcher, lost his heart
to Sydney when in that city last week. As an artist
on copperplate he tell in love with the crooked
streets and their unexpected vistas, the old buildings
ai.(l the broken skylines from the Harbor. Sydney
artists gave him a warm welcome. For many years
his work received no notice, but lately it is coming
into its own—the purchase of a complete set of liis
etchings by the Mitchell Library giving it a big lift.
At a dinner given to Shirlow at the Wentworth Hotel
there were no formal speeches, but it was shown
that his art has been an inspiration to most of the
younger etchers.
The British. Admiralty has at last had
to talk plain English to fond mothers who
want to push their darlings into the Navy.
No, not our own navy—the ever-so-much
more swagger English service. Wherefore,
at last, “the Admiralty desires it to be
known that employment in commissioned
ranks cannot be guaranteed without per-
sonal interview, and, further, it is impos-
sible to give consideration to such applica-
tions from Australia, in view of the great
expense of sending candidates to England
when perhaps they might on arrival be
found to be unsuitable.” It’s another broad
hint to Australia to go ahead and use her
raw material in her own institutions.
Mrs. Grundy having moaned a lot lately,,
about the young thing who proceeds to a
Sydney beach concealed beneath a kimono
and who openly casts the encumbrance on
the sand before slowly rushing to embrace
the waves in a chest-to-knee protector, Jack
Fitzgerald, a member of the Cabinet, was
directed to inspect the situation. As he had
previously accused himself of having watched
2,000,000 Yanks bathing at Coney Island,
N'York, John D. was considered to have
special qualifications. Though overwhelmed
with departmental work and cares of State,
lie sternly threw them aside and for once
red tape found its master. It seems that he
paid a “secret” visit to all the beaches within
reach of Sydney and for several days refused
to spare himself a moment’s rest. Dis-
guised in his ordinary whiskers John looked
for something to blush at in public, and
retired from the quest after drawing a blank.
All of which means that Jack Fitzgerald is
a decent-minded man. Yet, in spite of his
report, there is one aspect of this mixed-
bathing that requires handling. It has
nothing to do with estimating decency by a
tape measure, and it applies particularly to
night-bathing. This is that the parts of a
beach set aside for bathing should be used
for that purpose only. People should either
bathe there or be somewhere else, and
someone should be on hand to . see that
they are. A few lecherous, foul-tongued
blackguards lolling about between the water
and the dressing-sheds can be infernally
objectionable .circumstances. The inspecting
Minister having satisfied himself about the
millinery should attend to this part of the
business, and do it now.
Hans Hansen, a rugged old Dane of 80
who is still market-gardening at Carnegie
(Vic.), is the sort of citizen Australia would
like to import in shiploads. The ancient,
who hails from a little Danish town on the
Prussian border, is the parent of 13 Aus-
tralians, who are doing their duty strenu-
ously according to their sex. Of the seven
daughters six are married, while five of the
six boys are helping to keep Fritz awake
on the Western Front. One of the warriors
has a lad of his own keeping step with him
somewhere about the Somme. The mother
of this hefty lot, who was a member of the
Bradish clan living in the neighborhood, died
a couple of years ago.

“Bombardier X.” : We were seven days
reaching the Somme from the Northern
sector, and for the first three days I was in
the line four other chaps and I existed
wholly on cheese. The ration cart got
bogged, and as fast as they liked to put the
tucker on pack-horses Fritz sniped it with
5.9 shells. But war has not exhausted its
horrors when it has been rude to your
dinner before it has reached your pantry.
When we did get a meal up our cook, hav-
ing but a splinter or two of firewood, put
on a bundle of rubbish. Most unfortunately,
too; for the rubbish contained a German
bomb, and we picked up our dinner from
shell-holes and trenches. It was shell-holes
everywhere in our seven days’ ride down
to the Somme. There is not a mark of
civilisation left. The fairly large towns
of Flers, Delville and Longueville are right
off the map. All that remains of Longue-
ville is a very big church bell, two spring
mattresses (twisted) and half a bedstead.
When you come to a place where the mud
is deeper than usual and the surface is more
torn, you know it for a town.

“4217 Gunner” : While convalescing in a
London military hospital, I taught King
Albert of Belgium’s sister a word of Aus-
tralian. We’d had a good old yarn about
the best country, and the lady had had to use
her hanky when she spoke of the way it
had fed and clothed her brother’s constitu-
ents. When she was calmer I gave her my
cap badge, after explaining the sunrise and
sunset, and said, “It’s a dinkum badge,
madam.” Then I had to explain “dinkum.”
She seemed struck by the word. It may be
the Belgian royal oath by now.
INCONSISTENT.
“What an absurd person you are, Charlie!
An hour ago you said you worshipped
the ground I walked on. Now you say
the grass is so damp that it’s giving
you cold feet!”
The letter of an old Bulletin contribu-
tor, now “on inactive service,” from a hospi-
tal in England :
Most of the real value of the Conscription vote
will be lost if Australia does not know what was
at the back of the men’s minds. My opinion,
formed after careful inquiry, is that the men voted
“No’’ in such large numbers, not against Consciip-
tion as a principle, but as a protest against what
they regard as their grievances. \ ery many of
them voted quite vindictively in consequence. I
found even myself engaged in a struggle between
my emotions and my judgment. This seems a
weird thing' to- say; but the next war will see
what will amount to a soldiers’ trades union. To-
day the soldier himself laughs at the idea. But he
thinks, all the same.
O. C. Beale, when he returns to Sydney, could
tell a good deal about the feelings of the men. He
and a couple of others addressed a great meeting of
soldiers, the object being to get a pre-Referendum
message from the men at the Front to the people
in Australia. They pleaded—it was no use; Bill
would not accept their resolution. If Beale
had opened the meeting instead of finishing it they
might have done a little better. He avoided the
pitfalls his two companions had fallen into, and in
a genial manner soothed the ruffled audience. His
jokes were applauded and generally the boys liked
his breezy, unofficial style. But he never pressed
the resolution.
That too many of them don’t get a fair deal
the men are certain, and they are not inclined to
reason whether or no it is possible to give them
one. Australians are not accustomed to be used
ruthlessly. They are in the habit, when they have
a grievance against authority, of getting an M.P. or
a Minister on the job. That’s at home. Here they can’t
work off steam that way. Think what it would mean
if a couple .of hundred thousand men in Australia
were suddenly disfranchised —were shut away from
the possibility of ventilating their grievance in
that weird thing we call a Parliament or before
a Minister, through a trade union or otherwise.
The feeling of impotence, when a small grievance
was discovered, would soon make the thing seem
of colossal importance.
You have to remember this when you hear of
the soldier’s discontent. The things complained of
may not be serious. It is the failure to deal
with them as these men have been used to having
their grievances dealt with that leads to the
trouble.
I really believe it would be a good thing if the
Australian Parliament deputed, say, three of its
members to come to Europe and listen to the small
grievances of Billjim as they occur. Even the
unloading of them would help the situation.
* * * *
Here is another letter which gives point
to The Bulletin suggestion that Billjim
should have two or three Parliamentary
representatives in England and France into
whose ear he could pour his grievances:—
Three months ago, in France, my pay-book was
taken from me and sent to London to be audited,
and for a month I was paid on forms. Then I was
taken sick and sent into hospital. From there I
notified my O.C. and paymaster in London that I
did not have my paybook in my possession, this
being the usual procedure. Well, that was two
months ago. Now they are giving me a new pay-
book, dating from the present, whilst I (unoffending
sinner) have to do without all the money
which was due to me on my old book. And how
badly I have wanted it! After discharge from
hospital I was sent to a village in S.W. England,
where I have been for a month without a change
of underclothes, a towel or a bit of soap, and not a
sou in my pocket to buy a feed. And if you kick
up, into clink you go! You demand a paybook.
Yes; they will give you one —without any credit in
it. # *

“F.N.T.”: Dr. Robert Cole,' who sits on
Melbourne’s remains, expressed his belief at
a recent inquest that the coronial job
would be reduced to utter unimportance if
instruction in swimming was made compul-
sory in State schools. As between three and
four dozen non-swimmers, mostly children.
have already been drowned this summer in
Victoria, the suggestion ' was perfectly good,
though very ripe. But as Victoria doesn’t
yet insist on the compulsory toothbrush, that
saviour of the race, it can’t be expected that a
more difficult business, such as swimming,
will be taught with any thoroughness for
some time to come. Nevertheless, timely
agitation by persons such as coroner Cole,
speaking from his place beside the marble
slab with a reporter at each elbow, should
help.
SYMPATHY.
FIRST SWAP (sympathetically): “’Ard luck a bloke losin' his right arm."
SECOND DITTO (fed up) : “Yairs! ’E won’t be able to saloot his offiteis."
From a Billjim’s sister in Westralia: —
In November The Bulletin printed a letter of
mine in which I told my experience of the Defence
Department’s Pay Office. In June, 1916, my brother
was promoted sergeant and increased his allotment,
to me. “My brother,” I said, “intended me to
use the extra money to pay someone to help during
the busy season on the farm, and, considering that
there are only myself and my father, aged 80, the
help is badly needed.” Until that time I had not
been able to get the money; and this is how the
matter has since proceeded. On November 30 I
wrote to the Perth Headquarters recapitulating the
facts and adding that, trying to do our bit, we
had applied for a trifle of the War Loan, but that
in consequence of the non-payment of my brother's
money we could not complete the subscription. The
only satisfaction I got was that “payment of extra-
duty pay cannot be made until authority is received
from overseas.” That was at ! the end of December,
seven months after the re-allotment had been made.
Down to this moment, owing to the money not being
forthcoming, I cannot hire help and have to work
mostly 16 hours a day and every day in the week to
keep the farm going for my fighting brother, should
he be spared to return. I am not complaining of the
work; I do it willingly. But I know how my
brother is feeling about it, and that’s what hurts.
And I know it is not good, either, for the spirit of
our army.
Still worse, this is not an isolated case. The
Bulletin has had dozens of complaints on
the same subject; and undoubtedly the dis-
satisfaction and discontent caused by such
failures in administration were responsible
for a large proportion of the rebellious “No”
votes that Billjim cast on Conscription.
J. D. Fitzgerald, the old-hand N.S.W.
politician, last week discussed ways and
means of moving the man who stays at
home. His platform experience tells him,
he says, that it is no use handing out in-
sults; the best plan he found was to show
the bigness of the job and the urgency of
the need for help. But this only means that
that is the sort of appeal Fitzgerald can
make best; naturally a man who isn’t built
for firing insults can’t do much damage with
that ammunition. Probably, there being all
sorts of people, you must come at them in
all sorts of ways. Yet there is one appeal
that is typically Australian. It is to “do
the fair thing.” If you can’t convince the
typical Australian that it’s a fair thing to
give his overworked cobber a hand in the
trenches, you will not get him at all. There
never was such a rush to enlist as when
the good stories were being printed from
Gallipoli—stories which left no doubt that
Billjim did need a hand. And that is just
what the military panjandrums are keeping
us short of now. Half a dozen stirring
stories from the Front would rope in more
Australian recruits than a thousand speeches
from the Rear.
A NATIONAL LOSS.
HE: “My brother has been badly wounded —
lost a leg, you know.”
SHE: “Oh, what rotten luck! He was so
good in the tango, wasn’t he?”
BENEATH THE TREES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sometimes how sweet it is to lie
Beneath the shade of trellised trees,
Your head upon a fair girl’s knees,
Letting the facts of life slip by,
With head and conscience both at ease;
To feel by pressure of her hands
She likes your efforts to deceive;
She is not blind; she understands,
And, with a bending kiss, commands
More vows you know she can’t believe.
There is delight in hours like these,
In perjured oath and murmuring sigh,
Breathed with a conscience well at ease.
Beneath the shade of trellised trees
How sweet it sometimes is to lie!

“Chal”: A railway accident is generally
productive of hair-breadth escapes, but what
about this one? The Adelaide-to-Broken
Hill express while travelling at 20 miles
an hour ran into a stationary goods train
at Stockport (S.A.) on • January 19. The
floor boards of the compartment in which
a young lad named Jefferies was travelling
were parted for an instant by the impact
of the colliding trains, and during that in-
stant he was shot through the space between
the boards on to the ground below. On
the recoil of the train the boards came
together again. The jaws of death snapped
at him but missed by the flicker of an eye-
lash. The lad was injured somewhat by the
fall, but not seriously, and will soon be about
again.
Of course there’s a lawyer ready to take
the other side :
Writing of the successful lawyer (B. 18/1 /’ 17)
“An Old Wig” says: “To succeed he must not only
cut himself off from such intellectual pleasure, and
cease to acquire knowledge outside his own profes-
sion, hut jettison much of that which he has already
acquired.” The statement is a fair excuse for an
interesting paragraph, hut is it true? A glance
round at the men who have succeeded at the Bar
in Australia does not hear it out. Take the High
Court Bench. While becoming one of the soundest
constitutional lawyers in the Empire, C.J. Griffith
did not cut himself off from intellectual pleasure.
He found time for much general reading
and became an authority on Dante, and has since
made a translation of the “Divina Oommedia.” Hig-
gins was not only able to combine politics with
law, but saturated himself with literature and
acquired a range of knowledge that is encyclopaedic.
Isaacs also devoted some time to politics, and
among other things taught himself half a dozen
languages. Recently he added Russian to the list,
and when he has a spare hour or two he will
probably learn a few Hindoo dialects. Turn to
the Inter-State Commission, and we get. A. B. Pid-
dington, K.C., a man of wide general culture, inter-
ested in art, music and literature, and the author of
a capital translation of Gerolamo ltovetta’s
“ltomanticismo.” Did the late B. R. Wise “cut
himself off from intellectual pleasure,” or “cease
to acquire knowledge outside his own profession”?
Did ’s Honor Boucaut, a man of prodigious reading
and the owner of the best private library in Adel-
aide? Look to John Bull’s country, and similar
instances abound. For example, the now unpopular
Haldane—one of the most successful of lawyers and
a monument of learning on subjects unconnected
with law; and Augustine Birrell, IC.C. (author of
“Obiter Dicta” and “Res Judicatie”), one of the
best-read of modern politicians and most delightful
of living English essayists. And the list could be
continued indefinitely.
A FLEMINGTON SPASM.
ONE OR THE HERS : “Hullo, Dick, you’re not
looking well!”
THE H IM: “By Jove, but I am! In fact,
I was never looking better in my life —
I’m searching for a bookie that owes
me a fiver!”
THE FATTER OF TEE TRIBE.
FORTUNE-TELLER: “You are a nurse.”
GIRL: “No, I’m not.”
FORTUNE-TELLER: “Pardon, I was going to say you are a nurse by instinct.”
“Iris”: When there is any limelight
for the Yic. Board of Health, Frederick
Wood, one of the municipal representatives,
nowadays gets most of it. A particularly
bright beam smote Frederick’s noble brow
when he stepped forward, a few weeks ago, and
declared himself in favor of the compulsory
short-skirting of women, on the ground that
the long skirt was a collector and distributor
of germs. The Board
lias no power to carry
out such a scheme,
of course; neverthe-
less Wood has included
the proposal in his
platform for 1917. He
admits that compulsion
by law would lead to
all sorts of complica-
tions and loud laughter;
but an educational cam-
paign could hardly be
ridiculed out of exist-
ence. Many unobserv-
ant people believe that,
in the face of a fashion-
decree, nothing can be
done to counterbalance
the fiat. But consider a
case in point. It was
definitely decreed a
long while back that
the world’s new skirt
was to be ankle-long.
Well, what about it?
Is the average Austra-
lian girl now wearing
’em long or not? Not.
Most of her still allows
12in. or so between her
skirt-hem and the
germs on the sidewalk.
The large mass of Aus-
tralian women, having
experienced the free-
dom of ■ abbreviated
clothing, could quite
probably be reached by
a wide appeal to keep on wearing their skirts
short in the interest of good health. To
many people an effort like this may hardly
seem worth while ; but the scientist and the
medical man firmly refuse to take a frivolous
view of the matter.
“Melb”: Reference has been made (B.
25/1/T7) to the transfer of Champion’s
Queen’s Arms, Swansten-street, Melbourne,
at a mighty figure. I think Providence is
partly responsible. Melbourne’s original
Wesleyan chapel stood on the beer-soaked
plot. It was used as the Sunday-school at
the time they built the old white church on
the corner of Queen and Collins streets.
This was sold to the Bank of Australasia
for £40,000, and the glad Methodies de-
parted and built their awful white elephant
away up on the higher hill. The deserted
Sunday-school then became the. scullery of
the Queen’s Arms. The Methodies evidently
forgot to take the blessing with them when
they moved, for the pub throve while the
new tabernacle has wilted. And no sooner
had Champion left the place than he died.
There’s too much fuss about the returned
soldier being unable to find a job. For in-
stance, here is an opportunity going begging:
CITY OE MELBOURNE.
Applications, accompanied by copies of testi-
monials, will be received until 12 noon on Monday,
22nd January, 1917, for the position of Clerk at
the City Council’s Destructor, at a salary of 265.
per week.
The position is a temporary one only during the
absence of the present holder on active service, and
preference will be given to returned soldiers and
those ineligible for military duty.
T. GEO. ELLERY, Town Clerk.
It may not be permanent; but, God willing,
it’s at the very least four hoh a day!

“Salt” : After all, what is the precise value
of the copious statistics that are published
about the health of school children, as dis-
covered by the medical inspection system?
And the comparisons based on these figures
and other statistics from Missouri and Glas-
gow? It would be a long way more satisfac-
tory to know that the system
is what it pretends to be. At
present it isn’t. The medical
inspectors discover lung trouble,
cardiac affections, curvature of
the spine and so on by looking
at the youngsters’ tonsils and
making a diagnosis on “general
appearance,” the children not
being examined in the skin. Of
course the thing would be
right if done properly, but until
it is done that way there is not
much use in cackling about our
“progress.” To illustrate my
point, I state the case of two
kids. In one it was stated that
throat trouble existed in a seri-
ous form. A leading specialist
could find nothing wrong. The
other child was treated on “Oh,
you’re all right” principles. He was dead,
from what was the matter with him then,
within a week.
* * * *
“F. 8.” remembers his long-past days of
piety:—
A breath of Royalty hangs around the little old
Methody Church at Dundas (Parramatta). Many
years ago, when Edward, Prince of Wales, recovered
from a fever, a thanksgiving service was held there
by John Mills, orchardist and dominie ; and the ser-
mon, duly printed and forwarded, touched Victoria’s
heart. It was a practical touch, too, and with the
proceeds two sets of Prince of Wales’s feathers, cun-
ningly wrought in stone, were added to the church,
and there they wave to this day.
The feathers had scarcely done their first shiver
when on a Sabbath morn John Mills arose and gave
forth his text: “Pewer Religion.” Then good Bro-
ther Tutt, upending himself, spake. “Three Sundays !”
he said. “Three sermons! One text!” Here a
loving hand caught a swinging coat-tail and the
heckler sat down. The preacher was calm; but as
the service concluded he sent a gleaming eye to
Brother Tutt and announced his intention of having a
fourth cut at the same text next Sabbath.
On another occasion John Mills’s Sabbath duty lay
in a town strange to him. Approaching the chapel
he was met by an affable gentleman who invited him
to dinner, promising sucking-pig. The prospect was
not unpleasing, and, uplifted in spirit, the preacher
took his fences like a bird. Always a believer in prac-
tical Christianity, one of his exhortations ran: “If
you wish to be a Christian, beware how you ticket
your goods!” Descending from his pulpit John was
confronted by his would-be host volcanic with emo-
tion. “Who told you to insult me, sir?” he splut-
tered. “Do you know 1 am the only storekeeper in
this town who ever tickets his goods?” And with a
snort he turned and vanished. And with him van-
ished a vision of yellowish green peas nestling against
warm brown crackling.
John Mills, orchardist and Metliody preacher,
dominie and democrat, was the first public-school
teacher in Australia to decree that in his school no
distinction should be made between children of
“assisted” immigrants and those of luckier parents.
Long since he has “gone West” ; but to-day 14 of his
grandchildren are squirting their religious messages
“somewhere.”
S. Aus. has remarkable luck with its rail-
ways. The other day it let the express
from Adelaide to Broken Hill run over the
points at Stockport into a train waiting on
a siding, and much the same thing happened
at Burra several years back. Yet in neither
case was life lost. In fact, the State prides
itself on having never killed a railway pas-
senger, except in the horrible case where a
prominent politician of the last generation
was burned to death by an exploded oil-
lamp. That was shockingly bad luck, of
course; but equally it is good luck that lets
all the badly-bumped people in a colliding
train get off without one fatal injury.
* * * *
The appalling bungles in the administra-
tion of the Defence Department pretty well
reached a climax in the case of Gunner
A. .T. Fisher, of Nimbin (N.S.W.). This
Billjim was posted as a deserter on May
29, 1916, and his family was notified accord-
ingly. Also the Lismore Land Board was
Informed that Fisher was a deserter, where-
fore his holding was no longer protected.
As letters continued to be received from
Fisher from the firing-line, Massey Greene,
the M.H.R. for the district, started to probe
the matter; and then it was casually ad-
mitted that it wasn’t this Fisher who had
deserted, but somebody else. So far nobody
lias been shot. Nobody, it seems, has even
been shot out.
MAUDIE'S FOOL.
HE : “Your friend Maudie’s engaged, my
dear!”
SHE: “What! Maudie engaged! Well, I’ve
always said no matter how plain a girl
may he there’s, always some fool ready
to marry her. Who’s the fool in this
case?”
HE: “I am, my dear!”

'‘Every inch „( the ground covered on the Sinai Peninsula is full of historical interest... .The chief line of communication is the old Palestine-road. . . .Romani was fought with,,,
a few miles'of the site where Pelusium was won and lost.
ALONG old Earth’s most ancient
Road,
Where prehistoric traders strode,
Patiently picking out the way
To Europe from the teeming East —
The track of warrior and priest—
Another conqueror comes to-day.
Across the endless Sinai sand
Almost to Yahweh’s Promised Land
Moses his weary millions led.
The grim Assyrian came to slay;
Sennacherib once passed this way,
And left the Highroad running red.
Phoenician pedlars with their packs
Made roads of these frail desert tracks;
Great Alexander marched this route;
Pharaoh and Persian trod this path,
Till Rome swept down, with sword of
wrath,
Jerusalem at last to loot.
Then from the unconsidered North
The mailed Crusader issued forth,
To fail before the Saracen;
Napoleon came, and met defeat:
Along the Road his swift retreat
Made firmer ground for better men.
The sands swept down, the Road was
lost,
And few the caravans that crossed
The Path of Destiny and War;
And though forgotten, desolate,
The desert Highway seemed to wait
The footsteps of a king once more.
What strangers these that proudly ride?
What caravans dimly descried
Above the lonely desert line?
On camel and on brumby back
They take the legendary track,
The ancient Road to Palestine!
The desert dust of captains dead
Watches them pass in sullen dread:
What manner of new nien were these?
Think then unchallenged they shall ride
In their unthinking, youthful pride
Our Roadway built of histories?
Their camels, older than mankind,
Wonder in slow amaze to find
Upon their backs these youths elate:
Do they not know that kings have
marched
In equal scorn our deserts parched?
Do these things hope to vanquish
Fate?
What means this unguessed Avatar,
This casual genie from a far
Horizon-hidden hemisphere?
Upon this prehistoric Road,
Where empires vast have ebbed and
flowed,
The Bedouin of the Bush is here.
Profaning with his adjectives
The silence that in Sinai lives,
The Anzac Bedouin has come;
And, virgin to the trade of war,
He at Romani wins once more
The battle of Pelusium!
So Bill the Bedouin takes the track
On brumby or on camel back:
To History himself he brings.
Sennacherib and Pharaoh ride
With Alexander by his side f
Upon the Road of conquering kings.

Donald Macrae Stewart, Presbyterian cap-
tain of souls at Malvern (A’ic.), lately re-
turned after, clmpling the 21st Bat-
talion in Egypt, Sinai and France. Lest
he should have nothing but a chest-ribbon by
which to remember these experiences, _ the
battalion has sent him a blackwood shield,
c ar ryi n g the
colors of the
regiment and a
few words of
explanation.
Stewart is a
grey man who
looked a better
fit for the easy-
chair than for
the rigors of the
field. Still, he
reckoned that
looks were de-
ceptive and soon
proved it. He
was one of those
aboard the tor-
pedoed Southland.
W. O. WISE.
Police Magistrate
of Southern
Tasmania.
General Maria Gordon, formerly Chief of
Staff in Australia, now smells lots of powder
as officer in charge of the Scottish filling
factories.
Charles Moore, who started from the North
of Ireland with nothing but a strict Sunday-
school training, and died, comparatively
young, with big drapery palaces in Prahran
(Vic.) and Adelaide, seems to have been
able to impart what he knew. W. P.
Wearne, his right-hand man in the Adelaide
chiffon-shop, has bought up John Payne’s
P>on Marche in Bourke-street, Melbourne,
and moves in there at once.
In one of his wider sweeps the old Reaper
has cut the foothold from under Bill Laurie,
the prospector of the Far Nor’-West gold-
field at Tanami, of which much was ex-
pected in 1912, or thereabouts. Bill was
thrown out of his buggy, while returning to
camp from Hall’s Creek, in the Kimberley
country, and if he has got all that was due
to him he is now in the Citv of Gold wear-
ing numerous stars in his crown. Though
he had to pull out of Tanami for lack of
money, he believed in the field to the last,
and looked forward to the time when he
would be sending the metal away in large
parcels.
Ambrose Patterson, the Australian artist
who has struck luck painting patches of
Honolulu for American trippers, has a re-
markable hand, A r ery long and very slim.
There is only one other hand to compare
with it in Australia, and that is Norman
Lindsay’s wonderful fist. One day Patter-
son, lunching in a Bohemian restaurant in
Melbourne, had for vis-a-vis a quaint, black-
browed foreigner who looked like a Dago
conspirator escaped from an American film.
The two entered into conversation, and some-
where between fish and coffee the stranger
said: “Ah, ackscus-a me, the han’, eet iss
remark’—so long, so vera theen. Ah,
ackscus-a me, what ees eet how you make-a
the living by?” Patterson explained that
he was an artist. “Painta the peeckture?”
said the other sadly. “Ah, ackscus-a me,
the peety, the ver’ great peety.” He looked
at the artist’s digits longingly. “Ass. the
peekpocket none could haf approach you—•
you would haf be marvellous.” The stranger
drew a card from his pocket, clipped it on
the table, and said : “Eef you effer shange-a
your min’, I teach you in tree lesson. I
teach-a you for nothing.” Then with a
deep sigh he pulled a watch from his pocket,
placed it before Patterson, and went out.
It was Patterson’s watch.
Dr. Howse, of Orange (N.S.W.), just
yarded and branded 1v.C.8., won the V.O.
with the A.M.O. in the Boer War. Knight-
hood is thrust upon him now for his fine
work as director of Australian medical ser-
vices in France. He deserved something
better —and for that matter has it.
Melbourne will miss the dapper figure of
jaunty Louis Waxman, who, after a plucky
fight with a painful internal complaint, was
counted out on January 27. Though a
mere youngster of 50, he was one of Mel-
bourne’s most successful solicitors. Last
year he was concerned with almost every
variety of legal action, and was not once on
the losing side. A recent appearance was
as a witness before the N. S. Wales Com-
mission that inquired into the petrol
scandal, which unsavory business he was
instrumental in bringing to light. He was
a lover of literature, an accomplished
musician, a first-nighter, and a bowls cham-
pion who wrote about the game better even
than he played it. A brother is Albert
Whelan, who has made fame in the music
halls.
“Karee’s” send-off:—-
Lieut. Rene de Tournouer, for 13 years a resident
of Melbourne and Ballarat, where he managed
Pathe’s pictures, was killed recently in the Verdun
sector. His was a spirit! He was of indifferent
health and crippled in infancy (his left leg several
inches shorter than the right and the ankle ankv-
losed), yet, as a true Australian and Frenchman,
he wished to play the game. He had several shots
at the A.I.F. hut was passed out, and met with no
better success at the French Consul’s. Nothing
daunted, he left his business to look after itself,
and , sailed for France in September, 1914, intend-
ing, if rejected, to join franc-tireurs in the
Argonne. After three tries he was taken into a
Verdun infantry unit. Hearing of his eldest
brother being killed near Oompiegne (on the very
grounds once owned by his family, by the way), he
applied for transfer to the 2nd Zouaves to replace
the lost. After being twice mentioned he was given a
commission. Ilis third “mention” brought him the
War Cross with palm. He leaves, of his name, two
Queensland brothers, one a corporal in a French
and the other in an Australian howitzer battery,
a father who is Major on the Verdun staff, an uncle
in Hie aviation corps, two conffns in the Russian
army, and others too numerous to mention.
The explorer Sturt’s association with S.
Aus. is recalled by the erection of his statue
in Adelaide. Long after his discovery of
the Murray in 1830 he settled in S. Aus.,
did some more exploring of less importance,
and was Colonial Secretary till he retired
to England in 1851. N. A. Richardson has
turned up a letter which Sturt wrote to the
Assistant Secretary—Richardson’s father-
on retiring. It regrets “having taxed you
more than I should otherwise have done
with a more perfect vision.” Sturt’s eyes
had been ruined in his exploration journeys.
“Bilbie” : George Richard Tnckwell, men-
tioned in B. 18/1/T7 as being probably the
oldest Australian native with white skin
(92), has a long way to go for the prize.
Let me introduce him to John Wood, for-
merly of Brundali station, near Grenfell,
now of Parramatta. He was born at
Charley Walker’s hotel, Parramatta, on
February 3, 1819. and was baptised on
September 15, 1820, by the Rev. Henry'Ful-
ton, of Castlereagh, near Penrith.
HIS CHANGE.
S HE: “I would like even the man I love
best to go to the Front.”
HOPELESS ONE: “By Jove, so would I!”
Sergeant J. J. Myers, of the A.1.F., who
has been mentioned in despatches and given
the Military Medal for gallantry at the
Somme, had only just left the Marist College
at Bendigo when the war started. He
enlisted at 18, in time to see the latter part
of the Gallipoli tragedy, and has been
wounded four times up to date.
Frank Lundie, probable successor to old-
man Spence as president of the A.W.U., is
the thinnest, hungriest-looking union secre-
tary that ever was. He is also the meekest
—until a shed boss wants to dock somebody
tuppence, or a representative of the Hughes
party hurts his feelings. Then blood and
hair fly. Like Spence and many other
A.W.U. leaders, he doesn’t either smoke or
drink.
HIS KIT.
“Now, Tom, before we start, are you sure
you’ve got all the accessories?”
"Um! Got two extra tyres, an alias, an
alibi and enough money for bail!”
But for a blow on the head from a bottle
wielded by one of a push of larrikins 22
years ago, when he put up a plucky fight
from which he emerged witli a fractured
skull and b>ss of speech, John Gleeson might
have been Chief Commissioner last week
instead of an inhabitant of Melbourne
Morgue. His early career was notable. In
1886 he and another constable arrested one
Hopkins, who, with Beale and Murray,
attempted to rob a Collingwood bank. The
manager, Hill, shot Murray in the arm. A
volley followed, and the caretaker was shot
dead. The robbers fled, but Hopkins was
soon caught. Beale fell into the hands of
Tommy O’Callaghan, afterwards Police Com-
missioner, and Murray, after having coolly
had the bullet taken out of his arm at Mel-
bourne Hospital, was arrested in a loft. The
trio served long sentences. To get back to
Gleeson, he never recovered from the push’s
attentions, and was given the semi-caretak-
ing job of resident policeman at Studley
Park. Here he dwelt for 21 years until,
while his wife was out shopping, he fired a
bullet into his brain, and left his young son
to break the news.
A reshuffle of billets in the Federal Par-
liament makes C. Gavan Duffy Clerk of the
Senate vice C. B. Boydell. Duffy, who is
white-headed and hectic, leaves a vacuum
in the Reps., which W. A. Gale, Assistant
Clerk of that chamber, will endeavor to fill.
Gale is a. tall, jerrybuilt sort of person of
kindly disposition, and occasionally woos
the Muse of Poesy in a hoarse, patriotic
voice. T. Woollard, who has grown bald-
headed in trying to dodge trouble as Ser-
geant-at-Arms, succeeds the Tornado; and
the brief and rather fussy Clapin, previously
Clerk of the Papers, will mount the Ser-
geant’s perch on the floor of the House.
All of those jobs are practically gilt-edged
sinecures, reouiring tact, a knowledge of
the three R’s, and a smattering of legal
lore. The worst post of the four is worth
£6OO a year. Gale and Duffy get £lOOO
each, and Woollard will probably have £775
to play with. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment, which urges everybody else to econo-
mise, annually bursts up £3375 on these
mostly-ornamental personages.
The death of Antonio Costa at Newcastle
removes another brave man who never fal-
tered when help was needed for shipwrecked
people. When the steamer New England
was wrecked at the Clarence River bar in
1882, Costa, Loscocco, Jules and Lemaire
made two trips through the surf in a ship’s
boat and rescued 11 people who would cer-
tainly have been drowned but for their aid.
The Shipwreck Relief Society presented
each of them with a medal specially struck
for the occasion. Costa and Loscocco, who
died a few months ago, were appointed pilot
boatmen at Newcastle, and were members
of the lifeboat crew up to the time of their
death, Costa being the coxswain during the
past nine years. During that time they
did good work by rescuing the crews of the
American schooner Alpena when she was
abandoned in the Newcastle Bight and the
French barque Adolphe, wrecked on the
Oyster Bank. That work brought them
gold medals from the U.S.A. and French
Governments.
FOR VALOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Kaiser has decorated himself with the Iron
Cross.”
With modest hand I pin upon my breast
This solid, simple, iron decoration,
Proclaiming to the world I did my best
Through storm and stress to serve and save the
nation.
Millions have bled in our great Teuton stand
To win the right of universal plunder ; ~\ t
I am unpunctured, though my high command
Rolled in the loudest echoes of the thunder.
I played my part. Ever I urged them on
When in the blast of war their hearts seemed
quailing ;
And now that our best chance is past and gone
And all our Hopes look very much like failing,
I feel I must award myself a prize,
Ere our assault has petered out and duffered,
As recognition in the nation’s eyes
Of all the other chap has done and suffered.
In British courts a charge of murder stands
Against my name for horrid deeds committed.
With varying curses through the earth’s wide lands
My fame on anger-sharpened tongues is spitted.
I tremble somewhat in the midnight hour
When the twelve strokes, of doom are loudly clang-
ing.
If once the foe could get me in their hands
It might mean something very much like hanging.
Then, on the other hand, our German mob —•
The starved dependents of the men who perished—
Are wailing loud with treason in each sob
And railing at the shattered hopes we cherished.
If these should catch me —me their prince and lord —•
The awful beldams, sausageless and skittish,
Might choke me with a handy length of cord
Quite as effectively as might the British.
Having these things in near and steady view,
I wear with pride my new-won decoration
As token of the entry, hash and stew
I made of my beloved German nation.
If I may rise to Odin treading air,
While vict’rv bn French drums is gaily banging,
1 must have something suitable to wear
To grace my holy and distinguished hanging.

Another old friend has gone. Term after
term for more years than the ordinary share-
holders care to think about there has
appeared on the one side the contingent debt
of the bank in connection with the Assets
Trust and on the other the contingent assets,
consisting of the remaining properties of the
old bank. Gradually these remnants have been
realised. Now they have all gone ; and the
last of the old debt has been paid off. How
much the assets which were transferred to
the Trust 20 years ago fell short of their
book value it is impossible to say ; but after
getting help from the bank’s profits for very
many years, the deficit still amounts to
£692,660 less the small Profit and Loss
balance shown above. Nominally the capi-
tal is £2,213,009; actually the capital is
£685,276 less than that. The following
table, which combines the operations of the
bank and the Trust (and for all practical
purposes they have been throughout one
and the same), show the movement and the
present position more truthfully:—

In seven years, therefore, £343,623 of capi-
tal has been reinstated. Of the profit for
the past six months £BOOO comes from
“favorable realisations of assets of the old
bank,” and is, no doubt, a contingency fund
no longer required.
In seven years £343,623 of capital has
been reinstated; and £685.276 remains to be
replaced. What can be expected of the
future? In the first place, bank profits have
been shown hitherto “less losses of the
Assets Trust.” The bank now knows the
worst and the best, and there will be no
losses to provide for in the future. Perhaps
there haven’t been many for some years;
but, anyway, there is nothing now to reduce
profits. If anything, they will be better,
other things being equal. Times are very
uncertain, no doubt; but, though the bank
may be affected by a general depression, it
is in one respect well situated to make pro-
fits. It is paying nothing on its little bit of
ordinary capital, and can never be asked for
more than 4 p.c. on its pref. capital. Its
total dividend thus amounts to only a shade
over 5 p.c. on its intact capital.; and that
is cheap capital these times. Further, with
over a million and a half of share capital in-
tact, it naturally commands large credit.
Prospects for continued good profits in excess
of the dividend are therefore bright.
Whether they will average as much as they
have in the past seven years is uncertain, of
course, because, for one thing, the pref. divi-
dend, which is now the maximum 4 p.c.. was
only 3 p.c. down to 1914. But they should
be very substantial.
The next comparison shows a striking in-
crease in the figures since the end of the pre-
war year:—

Liabilities are now £7,737,720. Deduct
£3,396,365 of liquid assets, and £4,341,361 of
debt remains, represented by £5,911,442 of
advances and other assets. And among those
advances there is no old dead timber; for all
of that lumber was passed over to the Assets
Trust, and has now been got rid of. From
every point of view, therefore, the position
is strong.
The ordinary capital is £95,659 in 10s.
shares —all that is left of the old bank’s
capital. As the prefs. are limited to 4 p.c.
(£42,347 a half-year), there’s a good time
coming for the ordinaries, if all goes well,
or even moderately well. How long it will
be before they get a bite nobody knows, or,
if anybody knows, nobody tells. It was pro-
posed once, three years ago, to give them a
taste; but naturally the prefs., or some of
them, said “No; restore the capital first.”
Perhaps a compromise will be arrived at
some day. The Bulletin has for years
recommended that course, if only to. get rid
of the prejudice which is always liable to
exist against a bank whose shares are
quoted at a discount; and prefs. which are
only cumulative to the extent of 3 p.c.. and
can’t earn more than 4 p.c., are only likely
to be at par in such a money market as we
are not likely to see for very many years—
perhaps never again.

But what is going to happen to-morrow?
That is the trouble. In some lines Callan
Park could make money at present. There
is a factory, never mind where —it isn’t far
away—which had a good stock of its raw
material before the war, bought at 2s. 3d.
per (say) lb. The manager was a man who
knew Germany (and also England), and he
refused to be deceived by the Censor and the
“official press bureau” of those days, and
bought still more stock in expectation of a
long struggle. This stock, got in the early
days of the war, cost 2s. 9d. To-day the
factory is still working on those stocks; but
instead of basing the price of the factory
output on raw material at 2s. 3d., or even
2s. 9d., it is figuring on raw material at the
present price of about 9s. The public can
pay that price for the moment. By the
simple process of putting a few pieces of
paper through a printing machine we have
had a glorious boom even in the middle of a
war. Except in flesh and blood we have
paid practically none of the cost yet. We
have merely issued our lOTJ, and with the
proceeds are paying the factory before men-
tioned 9s. for what cost it only 2s. 9d. at
most. To get the necessary labor that fac-
tory has naturally been prepared to pay
almost anything, and put up with almost
anything. The same with Government ser-
vice ; the whole organisation has been
demoralised. We shall have to get back to
sane conditions ; and in the process of getting
back there will be many dislocations and
much suffering. Present conditions are so
artificial that this paper hesitates to regard
bank profits as anything but artificial, too.
Some bankers, at any rate, regard them
that way, and therefore put something in
the stocking for contingencies. It is pretty
safe to say that this co. is adopting that
policy.
The next table shows the movements since
December, T 3. Some of the changes, parti-
cularly in the past 12 months, are of far
less significance than they look. But take
the figures first: —

Deposits seem to have suffered a rather seri-
ous shrinkage in the past year. But pro-
bably most of it is due to variations in
Government balances and other money held
practically for safe custody at the end of
1915. The cash position is still extraordi-
narily strong: nearly 55 p.c. of all liabilities
are held liquid. That doesn't, of course,
mean that it is all non-profit earning. A
couple of millions or thereabouts have been
put into British and Australian war loans,
and more is going in the same direction.
Some of this money will no doubt come back
in the shape of customers’ deposits; other
customers will want accommodation while
they pursue the boom trade caused by the
Government expenditure of the borrowed
millions. In this way public borrowings
inflate both deposits and advances, no matter
what the borrowings are for. In fact, bor-
rowings for war purposes are liable to in-
flate them most quickly, because the money
reaches the public almost instantly, and it is
mostly spent, too, without a proper regard
for values.

That once more makes the reserves greater
than the capital. Five years ago the reserves
were £19,440 and the capital £15.000. Then
£5OOO of reserves were capitalised ; and now
already the £5OOO has been replaced. So in
five years tin* co. has done this: (1) Paid a
dividend averaging 11 p.c., though one-fourth
of the capital had only just been transferred
from reserves; (2) put by surplus profits
equal to one-third of the capital as at Dec..
1911. It is a remarkably profitable line of
business which can show such results; and
those who have the control of trustee concerns
ought to seriously consider whether they are
not inviting trouble. The present offers a
specially good opportunity for dodging it.
This co., for instance, has £30.000 of capital
uncalled and £50,000 authorised but unissued.
If the co. undertook to invest all the money
in the War Loan it could without a doubt
obtain permission to get in more capital.
Supposing it got in £25.000. This would
add £1125 a year to the profits. The share-
holders could get this plus their present divi-
dend. while the rate of dividend would be
reduced to 8 p.c.; and that looks a much
safer thing than 12 p.c. Also it gives an
opportunity for an increase without causing
trouble. Many trustee cos. would be all the
better for a larger capital. Also most of
their shareholders are prepared to put a bit
into the War Loan. Further, they know
the danger of a big rate of dividends. This
is a plan by which they may (1) increase
the capital. (2) invest in the War Loan and
(3) reduce the co.’s rate of dividend all in
one.

The accounts are still so badly presented
that it is impossible to state the exact posi-
tion with certainty. The capital is alleged
by the balance-sheet to be £65,374; but on
the other side we have this ’ amorphous
entry: ‘"Office furniture, motor-cars and
vehicles, overdue premiums, agents’ balances,
sundry debtors, goodwill, uncalled capital
and proportion of flotation expenses,
£43,423.” The original goodwill was £6OOO ;
presumably this has not been added to.
But how much of the other £37,423 is un-
called capital there is no way of telling
Disregarding the motor-cars and vehicles
and office furniture, this is how the matter
stood on November 30 :
Tangible assets . . . . £6242
Sundry creditors .. . . 5271
Visible tangible assets apart
from shareholders’ liability £971
The co. is of course carrying a certain
amount of risks. How much it is impossible
to say. Ordinarily it is reckoned that a
co. should have -rO p.c. of its year’s pre-
miums in hand to represent unearned pre-
miums. On that basis the co. should hold
£2570 to cover risks current on November
30. Exclusive of motor-cars, vehicles, fur-
niture and the other items in the amorphous
item before-mentioned it had £971.
On the figures submitted it cost the co.
over 30s. in exes, to get in 20s. of premiums
last year; and from first to last the exes,
have amounted to £2 4s. for every £1 of
premiums. Last year was the co.’s fourth
year, and, deducting reinsurance, it had
achieved a total premium income of only
£6429. The directors report:—
This is a fitting place to say that those of our
shareholders who are to be found fault-finding are
the very ones who never give the slightest assistance.
Shareholders who take their business elsewhere and
yet expect to see our co. flourish are certainly most
illogical. This is not a pleasant phase of our
business.
That is all very well; but the man who is
prepared to risk a fiver with the co. at one
stage of its career may not be prepared to
risk five hundred or a thousand at another.
Twelve months ago this paper expressed
the opinion that the law should not permit
a co. to canvass for business on accounts
presented as this one’s are; and it sees no
reason now to alter that opinion. The other
day, when there was a howl from a few
thousand city residents as to whether a rise
of a few shillings in ferry season-tickets
was a fair thing, the Government at once
set about making an inquiry. But an in-
surance co. with an almost empty till and
no means worth mentioning beyond what
it may be able to collect from shareholders
may take risks running into tens of thou-
sands of pounds—hundreds of thousands, for
that matter —on farmers' crops and country
people’s homes; and the Government will
be blind and deaf and dumb. It is time the
law said that every co. should be required
to show net assets (apart from unpaid cap-
ital) equal to at least 40 p.c. of its pre-
mium income; and one-half of that ought
to be in cash or public securities.

There was a time when this co. stuffed away
a lot of profit and was thus able, while pay-
ing a very substantial dividend, to distribute
many bonus shares. Of the present capital
of £466,067 no less than £146.373 consists
of undivided earnings distributed as capital
during the past seven years, though it does
not follow that the whole of that money was
made in the seven years. Some of it cer-
tainly wasn’t. In addition to the profit
which has been transferred to capital a
large sum has in recent years been paid up
by shareholders in cash. Investors, in spite
of warnings, allowed themselves to be misled
by the fatness of the bonuses. They had
no right to assume, in the first place, that
the new capital, much of it spent on com-
paratively new services, would earn 10 p.c.
and more because the old capital was earn-
ing it on old services. And they certainly
had no right to assume a continuation of
bonus distributions. It is the ridiculous
inflation of the market value of the stock
that has led to a lot of the present trouble;
for the directors are no doubt being pecked
at all the time by shareholders who, having
paid a very high premium for shares, now
find the return on their investment shrunk
to 2 p.c. or so. But it is absurd to argue
that the public should be made to pay for
that rotten-bad judgment. The dividend
has now been reduced to 5 p.c.; and taking
all things into account that is probably not
far short of a fair thing. On an investment
of this sort more than 6 p.c. at any timers
not a fair thing. What it yields the in-
vestor has nothing to do with the public.
It is his own funeral if he made a bad
bargain.
A question of interest is whether the co.
was justified in making those recent in-
creases in fares which for a few days had
as much attention in Sydney as the war.
First of all, some body has to pay the very
much higher rates of wages awarded against
the co. They must come out of the pockets
of either the shareholders or the customers.
Nine times out of 10 the. customers pay in
such a case. Wages for all classes of labor
have gone up ; and it is a fair assumption
that the public is therefore able to pay more.
But the customers must not be asked to
pay everything in a public service of this
sort if the shareholders are getting more
than a fair thing. At present, as The
Bulletin has said already, they are not
getting more than a fair thing. But, then,
the question of those bonus shares occurs.

“The Best that Money Can Buy” is a phrase truth-
fully applied to Adamax Roofing, for no roofing with-
stands changes of temperature better than Adamax —
the roofing that means cooler homes in summer and
warmer ones in winter, The process of manufacture
thoroughly impregnates long-fibred felt with pure
hydro-carbon, then develops a surface on the roofing
which makes it resist the elements. It is also
cheaper than galvanised iron and costs less for
freight. It resists sulphuric acid and chemical
fumes, and is thus an ideal material for roof or floor
coverings on mining buildings. Call or send for
full particulars to William Adams & Co., Ltd'.,

Now, some stock-watering is vile. But it
is not all vile. A company which hangs on
to profit has as much right to capitalise it
as another co. has to pay big dividends and
issue shares to be paid for out of those divi-
dends. In this case the co. no doubt overdid
the capitalising. It was a greedy concern
some years ago. But that the public was
compelled to pay too much some years ago
is not a good reason why the present public
should expect to pay too little. The only
other point is whether the co. is really mak-
ing more profit than it is showing. If it
isn’t, then it isn’t making too much—pro-
bably not enough. Take this comparison : —-

Other assets . . 37,834 38,868 41,082
As far as can be ascertained, while about
£14.000 has been spent on waiting-rooms,
etc., there have been no additions to landed
properties and there certainly have been
none to steamers. One or two may have been
improved, but it is doubtful whether the
value of the improvements has counterbal-
anced the general depreciation. Profits don’t
.appear therefore to have been stuffed away
in steamers, as they used to be; and other
net assets have shrunk in the two years
from £28,458 to £11,105. That looks as
though the past 7 p.c. dividend has been
barely earned; probably it hasn’t been earned
if full depreciation were allowed. The profit
for the past term shows a very substantial
reduction ; and if the revenue were not in-
cieased, it looks certain that the co. could
not pay 5 p.c. if expenses are higher, as
they doubtless are —considerably higher for
coal alone. Holman was therefore probably
justified in his opinion, based on figures col-
lected by his officers, that, in order to pay
exes, and maintain a fair dividend, extra
revenue must be got from somewhere. It
may be an unpopular conclusion to come to.;
but it is childish to adopt a certain public
policy—high wages or anything else—and
blink the consequences.

lowed by 30 p.c. for 12 months to June 30.
1016. Shareholders have thus received half
the present capital in two war years. True,
some of the shares have been written down
from 20s. to 155., and that makes a bit of
difference.

Butler’s Tin, Torrington (N.S.W.), has a
mixture of tin, lead and wolfram to contend
with, and is experimenting with a magnetic
separator to get the wolfram out, leaving-
ordinary wet concentration to recover the
lead and tin. Between July 3 and November
30 the battery crushed 046 tons ore and 440
tons that had been dumped for 25| tons of
tin concentrates. The co. still has a good
deal of financial leeway to make up.
“Midas”: The piffle that Ananias leg-
pulled Melbourne with two years ago con-
cerning the rich dredging sands of Waratah
Bay Beach (N.S.W.) is being resuscitated
in Sydney—with trimmings. A Sabbath
sheet lets itself go over the “untold wealth”
of the beach. For the benefit of those
who have bought £25 shares in the Golden
Sands at £4OO a time, and others who may
feel tempted to do likewise, let me quote a
mining authority recently sent by sanguine
speculators from Sydney to secure these
“sands of Pactolus”: (1) There isn’t any
beach at all at high tide ; precipitous cliffs
and ocean predominate. (2) At low tide
the sands, auriferous and otherwise, are but
a shallow sprinkling hiding the limestone
rock. (3) If there were any sands to dredge,
no plant could survive the winds that blow.
(4) No man at Waratah will leave his eight
bob a day at the local limeworks to have a
shot at thfe “untold wealth on the beach.”
The sole remaining joy of Berringa
(Vic.) is Dalrym pie’s Birthday Tunnel,
which isn’t much chop, after all, except as
a mine that can do cheaper work than any
other in the Cabbage Garden. For the
last six months it has been trying to get a
shoot of stone on the Surprise reef, with
which the old Kangaroo Co. dallied off and
on before the property was sold up. Another
few feet of work will about decide what
Dalrymple and his pals will do; for with
over 16,000 forfeited shares on the books
the load of keeping the staff going falls on
a very small lot of the faithful. The
Mines Department is lending a thousand to
help things on a bit, but the co. isn’t likely
to live to see the war over unless gold makes
soon. From gold worth £300,000 divs. of
£68,000 have been screwed, so that when the
flag goes half-mast for the Tunnel it will be
out of respect for a decent little show.
Here is the record of the South German,
Maldon (Vic.) : £341,000 dividends paid out
of £675,000 of gold won. with calls of
£36,000 to help. Nowadays the mine is
more or less a stringer. Patches of good
gold show up now and then, but do not
last long enough to get the old giant on its
pins properly. The last rustle was over
a tributor’s strike in a block above the
1750 ft. level; but so far the extension of
the level north has not disclosed any shoot
making down. To see if it hasn’t vanished
into the country more work is to go on
north, and as the fault has been reached
there is the usual off-chance that gold may
be got close to the break. Maldon is a much-
fractured zone, with the wonderful pockets
generally associated with some fault sec-
tion. That being so. South German intends
to hunt also at 1100 ft. in stone round a
break at that point. At 620 ft. also pros-
pects are better, so the old hands are cling-
ing on to South German.
The Government geologist of S. Aus.
(Keith Ward) drops heavily on to the Oil
Wells Co.’s prospects in the south-east of
that State. What they call “tar sand” he
calls “probably a mixture of sand and coal,”
and they are asked to say “material having
a waxy appearance” instead of “wa’x.” The
gas they have met with could be given off by
other things than petroleum ; the asphaltum
found on the beach (as at various points
along the whole southern shore of Aus-
tralia) has probably been cast up by the
sea. In short, Ward with regret decides
that “the evidence now available does not
warrant the expression of a hopeful opinion
as to the prospects of this bore, or of any
other bore that may be drilled in the whole
south eastern region.” This was after in-
specting all that could be shown him by the
co., which is now down 3050 ft.
The value of Westralia’s mineral produc-
tion other than gold for 1916 is roughly
estimated at £275,000, of which copper
accounted for more than one-third and tin
about one-fifth. The aggregate output of
metals other than gold to date is a shade
over £4,100,000.

Sandstone (W.A.), which lived and died
with Hans Irvine’s Black Range show, has
hopes of resurrection. Three prospectors
have struck something which is believed to
be the long-lost eastern leg of the Black
Range reef, and have refused £5OOO cash for
their find. Already they have crushed, from
development work alone, 250 tons for 6000 z.,
and similar stuff is being dug out. The
Black Range started producing at the end
of 1003, and between then and its demise in
September, 1016, turned out nearly
200,0000 z. gold, and paid shareholders just
under £250.000 in dividends. The adjacent
Oroya Black Range, on which 8., M. and
Co. expended over £lOO,OOO in development
and equipment before the battery started,
also did well for a time, but failed at depth.
From Westonia : “Edna May first; others
also ran.” This about sums up the position
here just now. Centrals are bravely sinking
the main underlie shaft, and are not say-
ing much about the operations. The shaft is
to be sunk to No. 4 level, and the manager
will then have a chance to do something.
The Central new lode will be all right there,
and the deeps of Edna May Consolidated
new lode should be there also. The mine
may talk again then, but it is not likely to
indulge in any of the well-remembered elo-
quence of old. As for the Deeps, with the
shaft going down in a very damp place, poor
ore reserves and creditors knocking at the
door, it is just about down and out.
* * * *
With the Leonora Gold Blocks (W.A.)
Melbourne is getting a run for its money.
Tom Williams is replacing an obsolete plant
with a serviceable one, and experimental
work has proved it eminently suitable.
Main shaft sinking and driving are in pro-
gress; and as the vein is on the narrow side
this work is necessary to permit the ore
to be attacked simultaneously from many
points, and assure a continuous supply.
The reef does not lose in width at depth,
and values seem to improve slightly.
Of course, the vendors depleted the stopes of
any rich and handy stuff available, but pre-
sent workings are well below the point
where the vendors’ dynamite was fired. The
grade of the ore is right, and though the
reef is slim the decent handling to which the
show is being subjected may compensate for
that deficiency. Treatment operations are
expected to commence about the end of Feb-
ruary.
Someone paralysed the town of Menzies
(W.A.) the other day by pegging out the
local railway station. The pegger states
that he struck gold in the station yard 18
years ago, but various Ministers for Mines
gave him no encouragement to mine on rail-
way reserves. The present Minister, who
is willing to do almost anything to sustain
Westralia’s sinking gold production, looks
at the proposal more kindly.
Edna May Junction (W.A.) has taken a
six months’ option on Slavin’s lease, Wes-
tonia, and has put “Billy” Collins, for-
merly manager of the old Croesus Prop, at
Kalgoorlie, in charge. Vendors’ figures show
that the. mine has yielded 2580 z., worth
£3 14s. per oz. to date, and the last lot
milled is alleged to have come from a for-
mation averaging 36dwt. per ton. A com-
mission is wanted to inquire into the doings
of this co., and until it has been appointed
and presented its report, the public should
stand back.
The proposed Westralian mining confer-
ence is off for the time being. Minister for
Mines Robinson originally intended to con-
vene it in March, but Parliament has since
decided to sit during that month. Mean-
time, practically nothing new is being found,
several old centres are being deserted, and
prospecting is almost unknown. War, in-
creased cost of supplies and shortage of
labor are blamed for the present state of
things.
Assisted by Huntly Clark, who engineered
the Lake Margaret hydro-electric works for
Mt. Lyell, Tasmanian water-power engineer
J. H. Butters has picked out a dam site on
the King River, and now all the Speck bar
to do is to arrange to raise the wind and
get the materials—both mighty hard in these
days—and then it can go ahead to generate
power for the Lyell Co.’s Read-Rosebery
electrolytic works. Butters reckons that
with the 450-foot head that can be got the
King will easily give 30,000 h.p., which will
be enough to go on with, though Bowes Kelly
talks of 50,000 eventually. And it will be
a cheap scheme, for the dam site is only a
couple of miles from the North Lyell rail-
way, and the engineering proposition is easy,
while the transmission line will only need
to be about 20 miles long if the co. uses the
Zeehan Smelters site. It looks good, but
nothing much will be done yet awhile. Mean-
time the co. is proving and experimenting
with the ore bodies and is getting an expert
from Anaconda (IJ.S.A.) to give a hand.
# * * #
Development at the North Lyell’s 1100 ft.
level is worth a close watch, because a north-
easterly drive has struck 30 p.c. copper not
far from the boundary. The future of the
Blocks, too, is in the balance in that neigh-
borhood.
F. J. Daniel, certificated mining manager:
Re “Dunedin’s” remarks on Rimu No. 1 (B.
25/1/Tv'). I wish to give a flat contradiction to the
tot of them, and to the ill-natured conclusions on the
incorrect premises. “Dunedin” says the ground is
heavy. There is no ground there too heavy for the
dredge to work. All my trial shafts while sampling
for the Options Co. never disclosed a stone that I
could not pull out with a two-man windlass. In
boring with the Keystone drill I only had to shoot
twice on all the samples from Rimu No. 1 block —
about 40. “Dunedin” says that holes 65ft. deep are
waterless; yet the dredge will bring up but stones
and water —-the water that isn’t there! There is not
a hole on Rimu No. 1 20ft. deep without water in
it; it was heavy water that stopped alluvial diggers
at depth, and it was water that caused the use of
the Keystone drill on No. 1, bottoming by shafts
being impossible. No American co. ever tested
Rimu No. 1. “Anything approaching the values”
stated by us, “Dunedin” says, is quite ridiculous,
which proves that we are fools and ignorant of our
business, because he says in the next paragraph that
we are "quite honest.” According to my sampling,
there is £660,000 worth of gold gross value in
Rimu No. 1. Mr. Seale, superintendent of the Gov-
ernment Keystone drill, has just finished testing No.
3, which joins No. 1, and his tests gave an average
of Is. 84d. per yard, with quantities of nearly 20
million yards. The Dunedin people confined their
dredging almost exclusively to the scoured beds of
rivers with small dredges which helped the boom
more than it did gold-mining. The M.L. West Coast
is sorry it lost Rinlu Flats, despite all that your
contributor has to say. I offer to give Hokitika
hospital £25 if your correspondent can prove that
there is a dry shaft on Rimu No. 1 25ft. deep or
over.

General-manager Corbould, of Mount
Elliott, is looking ahead when he talks of
making 3 p.c. and 4 p.c. copper ore payable
in the Cloncurry district. Copper is taken at
£6O, and at that price 4 p.c. is worth 48s.
That would be high-grade at Cobar or Lyell;
but it isn’t when the smelter is situated
between 500 and 600 miles from the coast
and has to drag its coal over that distance.
Fortunately Cloncurry is developing more
basic ore, and the available limestone fluxes
contain appreciable quantities of copper. The
Hampden’s experiment with concentration is
also a matter of great interest; and more
important than anything, perhaps, is the
opening of coal-mines near Bowen and their
connection by rail with Cloncurry.
* * * *
Charters Towers paid £18,034 in dividends
last year, but more than half of that was
from mines in liquidation. Among live
mines New Brilliant Freehold paid 6d.
(£3750), Bonnie Dundee 6d. (£2797), and
Papuan Brilliant and Victoria 6d. (£2400).
* * * *
Hampden-Cloncurry has blown in its fur-
nace again, and with only 350,000 shares
should find no difficulty in paying 2s. per
quarter, equal to 40 p.c. p.a. on the capital.
* * * *
What ought to be the dividend allowed
to tin-dredging cos. before anything is
demanded under the new profits tax has
been discussed at great length in England.
The result was reported at a meeting of
Malayan Tin Dredging, Ltd., in London on
November 16 :
A committee representing Malayan and Siamese
tin companies presented a carefully-considered argu-
ment to the Board of Referees, with the result that
tiie datum line, or statutory percentage, was raised
from 6 p.c. to 13 p.c. We had hoped for more, for
the life of a mine is uncertain and its potentialities
cannot be accurately gauged; but we received a fair
hearing, and must be satisfied with the decision.
The co. consequently paid only 20 p.c. for
the year, instead of the 30 p.c. that would
otherwise have been easy.

Sydney, January 29, 1917.
My Deau A him. —
If the Scotch folk of this city had even a
tithe of the imagination that made the
eye of their hero Robbie Burns glow so
luminously that “its equal was never seen
in any human head,” they would not leave
him leaning disconsolately against his
plough, his fountain pen in ids hand, among
the scraggy pines and dissipated-looking
hydrangeas of the Domain. They would
plant lilacs and hawthorn about him, and
Scotch thistles (even if they are prohibited
—the covenanters always did that sort of
thing) and ring him round wi’ gowans
fine. Gowans are only Beilis perennis, ye
ken, and would grow quite easily. On Satur-
day afternoon, under a blistering sun, the
Burns Anniversary Club gathered to cele-
brate the one hundred and somethingtli anni-
versary of the birthday of Robert. The
Granville Caledonian Society’s pipe band
and a combined Scottish choir provided
melody, and in the intervals various orators
spoke pieces. One, a sort of chairman with-
out a chair, said he need not tell that alidi-
ence that Burrns was the wurrld’s greatest
poet. After a Sassenach had murmured
“What price Shakspeare?” Senator Milieu
spoke, but his r’s had not the quality of the
true Scot.
Coal strike time. Forty minutes to wait
for a boat, and nothing to read but the
morning paper. This Miss Fourdrinier says
was the small seed from which the War
Chest Flower Studio (hereinafter known as
flower shop) blossomed. Miss Fourdrinier
read every word of her paper, including an
ad. which offered rooms suitable for a
“flower studio” at a nominal rental. The
roams were inspected and found satisfactory
in every way, the rent was ridiculously
small, but (of course there was a fly in
the butter) the tenant had to take charge
of a parcels office adjoining. In a flash
Miss Fourdrinier's brain saw a way to help
the sadly-depleted funds of the War Chest.
She consulted Mr. Walker, and on Decem-
ber 1 the War Chest Flower Shop put forth
its first buds. The rooms are in the T. and
G. Building, and that mass of masonry shel-
ters 88 tenants. If each of the 88 spends
2s. per day at the Flower Shop to
augment the crop of their window-boxes
(you needn’t wear out the tips of your
fingers, Arini—the Wild Cat man has cast
his ready-reckoner eye over my three sheets
of figures) the turnover will be £52 to the
War Chest every week, without counting the
Sabbath as a day at all.
Now the question for you to decide is
whether the takings of the shop are going
to be all profit, or whether most of the
flowers sold by the four alert and artistic
assistants will have to be first bought and
paid for. If you haven’t a garden, spare
a sixpence now and again to provide stock
in trade. If you have a garden, get up an
hour earlier and pick something for the
flower shop. After all, it’s to help keep that
lad of yours in good nick —many a boy in
the figliting-line has to thank the comforts
forwarded by this society for warding off a
serious illness.
The Australian Federated Women had
another pow-wow in the vestibule of the
Town Hall on Wednesday. Mrs. Danger
Owen took the chair. It is her pride that
she has never dabbled in politics—does not,
in fact, know the Tics from the Polis. But
she has a light and skilful hand on the presi-
dential reins—rather an important qualifica-
tion at a women’s meeting. The McKin-
non lady, in a gown of black taffeta, was the
first off the mark. Her slogan was duty—
to our country and our returned men. Mrs.
Bethel and Mrs. Burdett and others spoke,
and the vestibule was presently awash with
nice, warm glutinuous sentiment. At this
stage a large-sized Lordmayoral countenance
appeared at an upper window, looked
down for an instant upon the mosaic of
emotional feminine countenances, and fled.
Then like a southerly buster into a hothouse
came Miss Scobie’s vigorous and practical
recruiting remarks. Out West, where she
came from, the sheep are sorted out and the
“culls” sent to the boiling-down. That’s her
plan. “Get to work!” she said. “Get to
work every woman of you until the allied
heel is in its right place—on the German
neck !”
■ A good many sporting folk emerged from
their lairs on Anniversary Day and had a
flutter. Fitz Seariglit was with his well-
groomed missus and sister' Nellie Yeech from
Melbourne. Mrs. Tom Rolin was a study
in black-and-white stripes; she wore a
becoming hat of the tea-tray tribe under a
cretonne-bordered sunshade. Mrs. George
Black wore a harmony of biscuit ninon and
pale blue and a black velvet top-piece.
McMasters were out in force. Philip Mor-
ton was with his elder daughter (in a dark
tailor-made and a cherry-colored hat) ; and
among the throng were Buchanans of Kil-
larney, and the Burrawang Edpls, and a few
Hays.
Airs. “Sig” Brown, who collapsed after
an appendicitis operation at Parramatta the
other Saturday and died the same day, was
one of the Macarthurs who settled at Eliza-
beth Farm, near Parramatta, when last
century was very young, and introduced the
first merino sheep in Australia. Her
father, George Fail-fowl Alacarthur, was
the first boy on the roll of the old King’s
School in Parramatta when it opened in
1832. Long afterwards he was its head-
master —from 1808 to 1885. Sigismnnd
Brown, her husband, was a boy at the school
when she was the head’s daughter, and a
boy-and-girl affair led to a life partnership.
He has practised as doctor in Parramatta
these twenty-five years; but they still call
him “the young doctor.” Even the oldest
inhabitant can only dimly remember when
there wasn’t a Dr. Brown’s plate outside
the old square red brick house opposite
“The YVoolpack.”
The “old doctor” —Sigismnnd Brown’s
father—died about a score of years ago.
He was one of the Browns, you know, my
dear —from Colstoun, on the Paterson River.
Two brothers, E.G. and 11.1 L, were poli-
ticians of the long ago, representing Tumut
and Durham respectively. 11. 11. still
lives over in North Sydney, but E.G., who
in his time was “Father of the House,” has
been dead many years. Another brother,
John Dowling Brown, also long deceased,
was a superintendent of police in the good
old days when all the “commissioned officers”
of the force were “gentlemen” who had
never served their time at lumbering drunks.
Phyllis and Ruth Alacarthur, two girleens
whose names crop up persistently among
those present at every affair where our best
people show themselves, are his twin grand-
daughters. Sleepy Hollow will have to start
calling Sigismnnd Brown “the old doctor”
soon, for Keith Alacarthur Brown, the eldest
of the third generation, got his medical
degree at Sydney Uni. last year, and is in
France now as a surgeon with the A.I.F.
i Young Dr. Colin Chisholm Ross, son of
the old Alacquarie-street nerve-specialist,
who left here early in the war as a captain
under Col. Alorgan Alartin, in charge of
No. 2 Australian General Hospital, has
attained his majority. Incidentally he has
had to take sick leave, but he anticipates
being sent back to the Front when well
enough.
From “Rosna” in London :—•
Ada Crossley spends much of her time with
Tommy Kangaroo in hospital, and constantly col-
lects lonely ’Roos and takes them home to tea to
see her gum-trees that tower at least 3ft. high.
The other day the boys at the Weymouth Base Depot
were having a concert, and Ada rushed down the
entire length of the island to sing at it. You can
guess what sort of a reception Tommy ’Roo gave
her.
Canon Mort’s son, Stanley Fremantle, now Hun-
chasing, was married 'at Queen’s College Chapel,
Oxford, on December 4, his collaborator being
Boadicea Monk, of _ Woollahra. Another new
Sydney groom is Capt. S. W. G. Ratcliff, who is
with the R.A.M.C., but came over recently to marry
Constance Elizabeth Sutton, of this isle. Lieut.
F. F. Fergusson, of our Engineers (he's from Jeril-
derie), married Miss Birch, a pretty maiden from
Cheshire; and Lieut. B. Clifton, R.F.A., ran down
to Kent for a matrimonial appointment with Ida
Boyd, of Brisbane. An Armadale maiden, Adel-
aide Hughes, has joined the Flying Corps via the
altar, her bird being Lieut. Scott-Williams. Now
don’t say I never send you any news.
George and Mary Rex and Mary the younger
dropped in to tea at the Hospital for Australian
officers, run by Mrs. Popplewell, one-time Rosa
Bird, of Sydney; it’s at her house, which was
formerly the home of Jenny Lind. The Royal
Family is always very affable when it invites itself
to tea, and it ’ talked to the boys like a brother
and wouldn’t have any frill about it.
Airs. AValter Elkington writes from the
Hotel cle Bonfires et Cargill at Rome. She
had just arrived from Genoa, and was in
abject misery from rain and cold and lack
of heating apparatus. In a search of over
20 hotels and pensions she could find not a
single room with a south (the sunny)
aspect. Every one had been snapped up by
refugees from Trieste, Trenta, A 7 enice,
A 7 erona and other bombed resorts. Coal and
sugar, says Airs. Elkington, are now as
pearls of price in Italy. Her present to an
operatic singer friend departing for New
York was a small tin box of sugar. Geoff.
Elkington, her son, is still moving the
wounded in France. The shell-shocked cases
prove most difficult on account of the
strange delusions of the patients. Airs.
Elkington’s niece, “George Egerton,” the
novelist, has lost her only child, a lad of
21, bn a French battlefield. Count Ten-
derini, a romantic figure whom you may
recollect as a teacher of languages in Syd-
ney, is doing his bit in a frozen trench. And
so it goes on! The writer asks patheti-
cally after a mass of Christmas bush she
used to love at Mosman.
Edgar A. Knowles, of London, is estab-
lished at the Australia, without much
health but with plenty of help from a brace
of nurses and a sister. As a director of
Lever Bros, he set out to “do” their foreign
branches. After an inspection of the
S’African, Japanese and other factories,
etc., he landed in Sydney with appendicitis
and complications. The busy man returns
next month if his doctor so decrees. Mr.
Knowles was in Germany when the Great
Upset began and only got out with a hard
push. IBs sister, Mrs. Sutch, and her
engineer-husband are settled in Yanco,
where they’ve become farmers both.
There was a military wedding on Wednes-
day afternoon at St. James’s, and now May,
second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. AY. A.
Firth, of AYaverley, is the wife of Captain
Waine, youngest son of the old Randwick
Major. The bridegroom has recently re-
turned from active service with the
R.A.M.C., and will shortly leave again for
the Front. The bride wore a short frock
of white taffeta, the corsage being of soft
tulle, through which blushed the faintest
pink. The train, cut square, was also lined
with pink and was adorned with sprays of
orange blossom. From a wealth of orange
blossoms fell the long tulle veil, and she car-
ried an uncommon bridal bouquet. Winnie
and Dorothy Firth were the attendants, in
billowy frocks of white net over silk, the
frilly skirts being caught. here and there
with pale blue and pink. roses ; their black
tulle hats were relieved with pink flowers.
After the ceremony, food at the Australia.
One of the week’s engagements is that of
Minnie Burton Bradley to Trooper J. AV. O.
Row, son of the Commercial Bank manager
at Moss Vale.
Since she has been established at King-
ston Hill, in Surrey, Essie Jenyns AVood
has been doing her little bit for Billjim.
Part of her job has been to distribute piles
of Bulletin and other Australian papers
which she had arranged for friends to send
her. But the family is leaving Kingston
Hill in March, and her own address there-
after is uncertain; so she asks me to sug-
gest that those who have been sending
papers for distribution should for the future
post them direct to Cobham Hall, Kent;
Queen Mary’s Hospital, Rockhampton,
Surrey ; the Kingston Hill Infirmary, King-
ston, Surrey; or to some battalion or bri-
gade in camp at Salisbury or at the Front.
“And now,” big-hearted Mrs. AVood adds,
“I wonder if I can do anything for any
anxious mother of a lonely Australian boy
in London. If she thinks I can and will
write to me at the Sesame Club, 29 Dover-
street, London, AA 7 ., I will love to do all
that I can. I would like to mother them
all. AA 7 e shall take another house as soon
as a suitable one can be found, and it is going
to be a little bit of Australia, with the door
open wide.”
The bright little wife of Major Harold
Suttor babbles joyously of two months’
respite from hospital work. The French
military authorities were charming to her,
and made the scrap of Australian sunshine
feel as happy and sheltered as a chick
under its mother’s wing. Her brassard, the
badge of many months’ strenuous hospital
work at Giza, never failed to receive a
salnte from the French soldier. The lady
lias an indignant line, though, about food
waste in London : “Dinner at the Savoy on
Saturday, when 22 different kinds of soup
were served.” Major Suttor had been
loaned to the Imperial Government to go on
a. special pilgrimage (I mean mission) to
Jedda, and his lady’s travels were simply to
use up the weary interval until the 18th
December, when she was sailing to rejoin
her lord in Cairo.
The presswomen of Sydney are arranging
a songandance and some knockabout turns
. for the wild month of March. Proceeds are
to furnish the returned soldier’s cottage at
French’s Forest supplied by their brothers
of the Inky AA 7 ay. The corner-women
haven’t been picked yet, but Misses I. N. de
l’lble and R. E. Porter are rehearsing some-
thing that is said to be more striking and
scintillating than “The Submarine Star” or
the “Girl in the Torpedo.”
The death of Mrs. Emily Paul, the well-
known artist, was a great shock to many
friends. She was a brainy little woman with
opinions of her own, and a few years back
she stood for Parliament as a Socialist. Her
husband was the late Colonel Paul, and she
was the mother of Mick Paul, the black-and-
white artist.
Aline Laycock, a Sydney girl who went to
Germany with her mother in 1913 to study
at the Leipsic Conservatorium, has just got
hack to London after more than two years
of misery. After the war broke out the
two Australian women got used to being
described as “English dogs,” and it must
have cheered them greatly whenever they
remembered that they had come there with
good Australian gold to learn music from
the savage beasts. After the war, any
aspiring music-pupil who thinks she is miss-
ing the true flavor of Germanic culture by
staying ingloriously at home and studying
at a local conservatorium, can fill up by
hiring a drunken bottle-o to call her an
“English dog” and anything else his in-
flamed imagination suggests.
Every now and again Padre A. It. Martin,
vicar of Maclean, shakes the number nines
off his episcopal feet and with his family
“goes bush” on the coast near the fishing
village of Illuka. Here he camps and
baits his hook for fish instead of sinners,
and wrestles fervently with the unregenerate
North Coast breaker. At Yamba, near by..
there is a surf club, and you can be asphyxi-
ated there by being .towed ashore by excited
life-savers with just as much eclat as if
you were at Manly or Bondi.
Talking of surfing, this is a true cross-
my-heart tale. The surfers on a certain
beach found among the breakers a yacht’s
cushion that had been dropped overboard.
They used it as a surf-board —dived off it
and generally played pranks with it. One
of the youths, finding it bobbing in the
waves near him, climbed upon it, digging
his toes well in, for it seemed to have
become soft and sodden, and dived. When
he rose to the surface he found himself face
to face with a purple-visaged and furiously-
enraged female. “You cur! You brute!
You unspeakable cad! To stand on my
back—and—and” The youth, his eyes
goggling with horror, gasped, “I thought you
you were the cushion!” “Cushion!” she
spluttered. “You hound —I’ll —I’ll” !
Then a big roller took her and before she
emerged the affrighted youth had sprinted
up the beach, rushed into clothes and caught
a tram.
Marjorie, daughter of Grammar-school-
master Arthur Giles, is leaving shortly for
Egypt to marry Lieutenant .Tack Chis-
holm. The happy man (why not be optimis-
tic?) proposed by cable some time ago, and
subsequently requested the maiden to hold
herself in readiness to fly to him if he suc-
ceeded in getting a military permit for her
to go ashore, tie got it; also some months’
leave. Strange how deciduous the tree of
military service is for some people, while it
never sheds its leave at all for others!
Chisholm’s sister, the beauteous Sheila, re-
cently married Lord Loughborough—“Luffy,”
as his pals call him.
Miss Jacob, organising secretary of the
Australian \v omen’s Service Corps, has the
true leader’s spirit. She just radiates
enthusiasm, and her “men” (there are
already several hundred of them) would fol-
low her anywhere. They followed her on
Sunday to a hot snot —French’s Forest —
and with great gallantry charged the under-
growth on the soldiers’ farms and routed it
with enormous slaughter.
Golden-haired little Mrs. Tomkinson is to
join her soldier in London shortly. He left
as a sub. in the Siege Brigade, and quick
promotion has brought him to staff-captain
and adjutant to Colonel Coxen. Now he
returns to London to form up a new battery.
Mrs. “Tommy” was one of the Johnstons,
a pioneer family of the Gunnedah district.
The girl in the corner was dipping alter-
nately into a treatise on Theosophy and the
latest Modernist publication. Billjim boarded
the tram and swayed and billowed to the seat
opposite. He gazed fixedly for a moment,
then smiled with great benevolence. “Stu-
(hie)-studious. I like —see —woman —
woman” (he lost the word he was about to
use, caught sight of the wording round the
advertisement of a disdainful female clothed
in a slim-form corset) “improve her mind.
Comeanaver milk-shake !” No response from
the fair Theosonhist. Billjim swayed for-
ward persuasively: “Comeanaver milk-
shake!” “No, thank you, I’m not thirsty,”
replied the young woman. “Thassit” (his
voice was tinged with bitterness) —“goer
cross damned sea—still seashick—fight th’
Turk an’ th’ Hun, an’ w’en y’ come back
an’ ask lady fren’ haver milk-shake, she
turns y’ down. Repatriation, I don't think.”
And Billjim spat his scorn through the
open door.
The scrawny rooster that used to come
at 3 a.m. (old time) on to your verandah at
Manly and screech out his brass-hinged
defiance to all the other roosters in creation,
can come no more. The fiat has gone forth
with much preliminary thunder. He is to
stand not less than 25ft. from any dwelling-
house within the bounds of Manly. How*
beneficent are the ways of aldermen !
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

SPLENDID REMEDY FOR
CHILDREN’S COUGHS.
Mothers all over Australia are making in
their own homes as good a remedy as money
can buy for Coughs, Colds, Whooping Cough
Croup, Influenza., Bronchitis and Sore
Throats. All they do is buy from their
chemist or store 2s. worth of Hean’s Essence,
and add to it water and sweetening matter
enough to make up to one pint. Such a
quantity of ready-made cough mixtures
would cost at least 12s. The beauty of the
Hean’s Essence mixture is that it contains
no paregoric, laudanum or other opium
drugs, which are apt to do untold harm to
young children.— Advt.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, January 29, 1917.
My Dear Yarisie, —
The G.-G. and Lady Helen paid the Stan-
leys a brief hot-weather visit at the iron-
roofed Macedon State Cottage, and then
came home gratefully to the cool grey house
which overlooks the Yarra. Lady Helen
hails from North Britain and feels the heat
exceedingly.
Little Doris Blackwood is having a well-
earned rest from patriotic dish-washing.
She has crossed to the Apple Island with
Miss Macarthur Onslow, and they are get-
ting a shakedown at Government House as
the guests of the Ellison-Macartneys.
Our own Harold Grimwade is now Briga-
dier-General and more or less commands
3500 men, 3GO guns and 3000 horses. He
went to France early in January with the
Australian division which he had been for
nearly 12 months helping to train in Eng-
land.
“Bosna,” from London :
Lance Hawker, one of the South Aus. squatting
family from Bungar'ee, has been posted missing,
lie was a Major and only 20 and had already won
a V.C. and D.S.O. for bombing Hun ’planes and
Zeps. A warrior by profession he transferred from
the Engineers to the Flying Corps. The Michael
Hawkers’ two boys have been wounded and the
Edward Hawkers’ boy Stanley has a commission
in the R.F.A. The V.C.’s brother has been men-
tioned in several despatches for gallantry with the
R.F.A. also.
G. T. Butler, who is a lieutenant with the
Cyclists, and is a son of ex-Premier Richard But-
ler, the doleful politician of Adelaide, has an
appointment marked “Urgent” in the New Year.
The bride’s dad also juggled with the political
dagger at one time. She is Gladys lveay, daughter
of the ex-M.P. for Elgin, Moray and, Nairn.
Mrs. John Bishop arrived here from Melbourne
only just in time to be with her boy in his last
hours. The lad was a sergeant in the A.I.F. and
was badly wounded in France last July. He had
been in hospital in Sheffield ever since, and he was
buried in that town with military honors..
Commander Marsden, an Australian who
helps to boss the British navy, was travel-
ling, invalided, on the Arabia when she was
torpedoed. ’Mrs. Marsden is now racing
for England to nurse her sailor son over
this double shock, and also to cheer the
convalescence of son Lieut. Edgar Marsden,
who has been doing his bit with the Camel
Corps in Egypt. The third son (they are
all Australians of the second generation) is
a medical man in charge of an English base
hospital.
Young Anzac Sam McCaughey has cap-
tured Una McKellar, who, as a good looker,
would be classed A 1 at Lloyds. Young
McCaughey is a kinsman of squatter Samuel
of Yanko. His mother is Mrs. Jack Fisken,
who shines in society like a 1000-candle-
power chandelier. Una McKellar, who
tripped away on nursing work, owns a step-
father on her side in the shape of brilliant
little Dr. Ton> Dunhill, who can remove or
add a main porch or annex in the twinkling
of an eye.
Kitty Lewers, of the St. Kilda-road tribe,
who crossed the sea in search of war work,
sends word that she is marrying her old
pal, widower Ernest Robson, understudy to
Trinity College Warden Leeper. Robson is
doing his bit as an expert munitioneer in
England.
Another engagement signalled from Eng-
land concerns Hume Turnbull, youngest son
of the John Turnbull widow, and one of
the Archie Yuille girls.
Beau, the Fred Fairbairns’ boy, has found
an English fiancee, and the Australian girls
have lost one of their rich eligibles. The
young man, who has a commission in a
British cavalry regiment, was one of the
affluent youths who went first saloon to en-
list in England. At present he is convales-
cing after being gassed in France last year.
The fiancee is the daughter of the Hon. Mrs.
Hastings, of Rugby, England, and the Fred
P airbairns have just arrived in time to
meet her and administer their blessing.
The Philip Russells have just arrived
home again. Mrs. Philip is one of the
Guthrie clan who in pre-war days killed the
tatted calf many a time and oft at Osborne
House, Geelong, to which was attached a
private polo ground. Philip Russell has
been doing Red Cross work in England.
Mrs. Charles Fairbairn with her arms
full of flowers stepped nonchalantly on an
ocean-going steamer for the 10th ' time in
the last few years. She goes to see daughter
Esther marry Colonel Wheatley; also to
look after son Osborne, whose arm was
smashed whilst executing a flying-air raid.
Mrs. Charles has so practised a gangway
manner that she can now .step on an Eng-
land-bound steamer with the air of a North
Melbourne housewife returning from Ken-
sington after a morning at the market.
Mrs. Howard Clarke gave a wonderful
electric machine to the Malvern Red Cross
last week. The contrivance turns old rags
into lint and works at incredible speed,_ so
donations of linen are implored to satisfy
its appetite. Any soft old linen or cotton
fabrics (washed and white) are acceptable.
Tons of the stuff are wanted urgently for
the hospitals.
Hastings Cooper, the rich young bachelor
paper merchant, has just been through the
appendicitis ordeal and is now having the
convalescence of his life. Visitors have to
step cautiously among the gift flowers which
bank up like the spoils of a star concert
singer.
The very proper Alexandra Club dames,
who have swarmed safely from their Gas-
tower Club to the new Collins-street quar-
ters, know a lot of good stories now. They
heard them while the last alterations were
being made to the new clubrooms, the narra-
tors being the cheerful working-men who sat
in the Club windows at lunch-time. There,
careless of the feminine rage within, they
dangled their paint-and-paste-spattered legs
and boots, and guffawed while they bit sand-
wiches and quaffed cold tea. The icy
Alexandras fear that some ignorant passers-
by may have put the creatures down as visi-
tors.
A Yankee visitor tells of a very charming
Englishwoman whom he met a while ago
at Honolulu. .Her name was Lady Con-
stance Waugh and her usual address Lon-
don. She was rather appalled by the “vul-
gar tourists,” and was very exclusive.
According to the neutral citizen the lady
has never been to Australia, but promises
herself a visit some day, as she has "Heard
so much about the place.” Needless to say.
we w'ould be delighted to have her with
us these dull times.
Adelaide’s consignment:— •
The Price-Hay ward we(kli.ng adorned the tail-end
of the week in the St. Peter’s College Chapel. The
next best man was Lieut. Cedric Hayward, of the
R.C.F., who is on leave after a nasty smash with a
’plane in England. He sets off on his return to the
firing-line (or should it be flying-line?).this week.
The latest book by Alice Grant Rosnian, who still
sends an occasional word to Australia under her old
pen-name “Rosna,” has nailed the attention of
London critics. Incidentally, they have discovered
that she has a “saving salt of humor.” Some people
are not quick discoverers, are they ?
John Lewis, M.L.C., has had word that his son,
Major Lance Lewis, was wounded in early January.
He is, however, reported to be on the road to
recovery.
11l news has come to Mrs. H. B. Taylor of the
death of her only son. His father, Major Taylor,
who died some time ago, was Chief Justice Way’s
Associate for many years.
Mrs. de Wette, who came from England some
months ago on a visit to her father, Rupert Pelly,
is to be married to Oswald Barton, son of “Toby,” J.
Since she won the Elder scholarship as a schoolgirl
we have not seen much of her, as she remained in
England, working at her music, after the term of
her scholarship was up, and then married and settled ’
there. Another marriage is that of the Cloughs’
eldest son to a Miss Alexander of Rothgar, County
Dublin. For many years father Clough was resi-
dent railway-engineer at Mount Barker.
The North Terrace Destitute Asylum is being
poured into the Old People’s Homes at Mag-ill, and
the transfer isn’t winning entire approval from the
people most concerned. Some of the aged folk flatly
refuse to go so far afield, and are making arrange-
ments to live elsewhere. To people who can’t walk
far and have no tram money, Magill seems like
Land’s End after the comfortable accessibility of
North - Terrace.
Dr. Bollen has just returned from active service.
His last move was to the Somme, and what he saw
there should convince even Hun apologists who argue
that the military Teuton is better than he’s painted.
He says that every hospital, including the clearing
hospital and rest camp, was either shelled or
bombed from aeroplanes, and that in one night 25
men in the rest camp were killed in this way.
The Louis Wilsons leave here for Maoriland early
in February. He has been manager of the New
Zealand Insurance Co. in Adelaide for 27 years, but
ill-health has worried him and has caused his retire-
ment. > ‘ A*
Captain P. E. Julge, of ours, has won a bar to the
Military Cross which he received in August. The
award is for “courage and determination” and a
“fine example set to his men in digging ;& trench
75 yards from the enemy’s front line.” f
A real good frozen-in-Maoriland com-
plexion is a great asset to a girl. Amy
Murphy, pantomiming in this sunburnt
city, looks like a helping of peaches and
cream, neither hot winds nor stage cosmetics
having been able to spoil her skin. Like
the moon they’ve got at Auckland, nothing
can beat it.
The French people in Melbourne are
arranging official parties to welcome the
new Consul, Mr. Fliehe. He is the selected
successor of the late Mr. Homery, who is
affectionately remembered by many.
A lot of people who knew Louis Waxman
only as a dapper identity at first-nights and
other festive functions must have been sur-
prised to learn from his obituary notices
that he had been a lawyer in practice for
29 years. In the dusk, with the light behind
him, he might well have passed for 23, and
his style and bearing were as young as his
face and figure, Louis was passionately
fond of music and a clever musician him-
self. To pressmen and women he talked
usually of art and literature or the best
entertainment that was going. And his
remarks were always bright. On the first
night of the first Quinlan Opera Co, in Mel-
bourne everybody was discussing the Bar-
carolle in "Tales of Hoffmann.” "I can
conscientiously praise it,” said Waxman,
“for 1 once wrote a barcarolle myself and —
I prefer Offenbach's.” A humorous story
is told of the first night of. an Ibsen play
called “Lady Inger of Ostrat.” Nance
O’Neil and Co. were acting the drama and
somehow had missed the inner Norwegian
meaning of it. After two incoherent acts
Louis Waxman, pencil and paper in hand,
went across to a party of .acquaintances in
the circle and gravely asked permission to
put their names down for half-a-crown
apiece. “I’m getting up a sweep on the
plot,” he said—“the one who guesses nearest
takes the pool.”
The Staughton widow lately went to Bar-
won Heads to tone herself up for further
endeavors in political and patriotic matters.
Daughter Marjorie Palmer at the same time
trekked from hubby’s Western District wool-
patch to let the children paddle within view
of Gran’ma. The medical Morrisons, the
Charles Mills widow (Toorak) and a crowd
of social headliners keep things bright there-
abouts.
Accompanied by one of her soldier sons,
brisk little Britomarte James, formerly a
quill in our Writers’ Club and later presi-
dent of the women’s section, .of the Mel-
bourne Overseas Club, is doing her busy
best for Australia in London. Her husband,
v -qjL. vi. ri. dames, is a schoolmaster who
has done much for the cadet movement- heye.
aiid has scored more than one valuable prize
with his teams of young marksmen. After
paying her official devoirs to the Overseas
parent she stood up at the Lyceum Club and
told her hearers everything about Australia
which had not already been disclosed by
the Billjims now enlightening'London.
Allan Wilkie celebrated the anniversary
of his first appearance in Melbourne with
unexpected ceremony at the Princess’s last
week. First, there was a hash of immortal
William, followed by a pile 6"f liquids and
victuals for the early-morning elation of
the company. The intellectual feast brought
out a number of Shakspeare’s intimates and
kept them up much after usual bedtime.
Among these victims was Lady Munro
Ferguson, supported by Haskett-Smith. Alt'
Buchanan, a fugitive from his editorial desk
in Brisbane, reverently bowed his head to
Shakspeare’s music as if he were listening to
the Most High discoursing on theology.
Archie Strong, honorary president of the
Anti-Gagging League, was also there ready to
- raise the alarm should the bard be garrotted.
The devotional atmosphere was dissipated
well after 11 p.m. when trestles, groaning
under the usual supplies of bilious attack
and indigestion, were run on to the stage.
They instantly suffered severely in an
encircling movement cleverly executed by
the company. Food choked the exit of many
bright remarks; but when the provender
had been safely tucked away voices got busy
and gifts were presented. Allan Wilkie had
to return deep baritone thanks for an
attache case; and his wife, ’looking sweet
in sea-green, mentioned her approval of a
cameo brooch. A musical programme, inter-
rupted by speeches, followed until 3 a.m.,
John Fuller, jun., who is an alderman in
Maoriland, disclosing his aldermania in an
oration. Another conspicuous performer
was old acquaintance John Cosgrove. In
fact, warble, wassail and recitation kept the
stout mummer open-mouthed during the
whole shivoo.
This is good news! Harrie Ireland, the
graceful actress with the auburn locks, is at
last well enough to go on a visit to the
Bland Holt couple—her first real outing
after her terribly-long rheumatic illness.
Evelyn Merrin, an auburn-haired Mel-
bourne stage amateur of the first rank, has
crossed to Westralia to start dramatic
classes and demonstrate the physical culture
exercises that build up the reciting chest.
Evelyn is a sister of Mrs. Dickenson, wife
of the mining-man.
Florence Rockwell is flatting at Cliveden,
where she can get some green scenery and
fresh air without the expense of going to
the country. The actress is living very
quietly, and carefully inspects intruders over
the shoulder of a protecting mamma.
Henry Hyde Champion, the Melbourne
Booklover, is sampling the atmosphere of
Maoriland at present. Henry’s visit is
vaguely understood to be concerned with
a proposed Maoriland tour of “Damaged
Goods,” for which he is the agent in this
part of the world.
Artist Fred McCubbin has put aside his
palette to wrestle with a painful complaint.
The rble of invalid is not very agreeable to
the ardent painter. He is one of the ener-
getic sort who hardly regard sickness as
sufficient ground for divorce from the easel.
A bold conception finds life in bronze and
marble in C. Web Gilbert’s latest piece of
sculpture, “The Sun and the Earth,” just
completed in London. An irreverent sub-
editor has compared it to a rescue in the
surf, but it is worthy a better simile. The
Sun, typified as a muscular male, bends to
kiss with an ardor of gesture the recumbent
female form of Earth, at rest beneath, a
beetling billow of stone. Critics see in the
work an enhancement of Gilbert’s already
well-founded reputation.
1 ale Gilfillan is busy on a miniature
p e ba> a niece of the late I’roiit-
\\ ebb aiM the owner of a perfect Grecian
nose. This precious feature got an awful
bump in a motor accident recently, but has
recovered. Her adoring people are getting
the miniature painted as a sort of thanks-
giving.
The hritz Hart Oonservatorium is sustain-
ing itself during Melba’s absence by gazing
wistfully at the Hag she presented to the
school just before she left. The bit of bunt-
ing compels the respect of all who love
money, for Melba paid £2OOO for it at
some Red Cross show or other.
Mrs. Agnes Jan,son, who conducts the
singing study at the tlni. Conservatorium,
has evidently been inspired by Melba’s bright
idea of offering scholarships at the Fritz
“Co».” The Janson lady is now
oftenng a scholarship for the best discover-
able soprano or contralto.
Ihe schoolboy who so pluckily saved
little Ivy Higgins from drowning in the
Sandringham surf was young Grover, son
of Monty, of Sydney Sun. Young Grover
pulled the half-drowned Ivy into safety and
then went after Ivy’s companion—the little
daughter of Alderman Crichton. But she,
poor child, was drowned.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“Pick”; “Two Seas” (B. 4/l/’l7) argues
that because kangaroos are sometimes found entangled
in the wires of a fence, they cannot jump. By the
same reasoning birds cannot fly because they are
occasionally impaled on the spikes of barbed wire—
I have found curlews, parrots and crows thus trans-
fixed. Concerning the height to which a ’roo can
spring, I had one good opportunity of judging when
Peter Geld, a noted Gundagai hunter and bird-
catcher, in 1894 contracted to send alive to Sydney
a dozen grown marsupials. Peter built the wings
of his trap-yard to where a bush track crossed a
gutter, the banks of which were 6ft. perpendicular.
On the rim of the banks he erected a 4 ft. log fence.
We yarded seven kangaroos the first drive, which
Peter proceeded to bag in specially-made sacks. One
fellow, crouching sulkily by the bank, when
approached for his turn, sprang to the top of the
fence, wobbled there a moment and fell backwards
into the yard. It was a straight, standing jump of
10 feet.
“Bob I).”: There is nothing sensational
in “Wart’s” discovery of a freshwater flat.head (B.
4/l/’l7). I have caught dozens of them in the
upper reaches of the Narrabeen Lakes (N.S.W.).
At spring tides the heavy sea washes the deep-sea
“flats” through the entrance to the lagoon, and to
avoid a conflict with the Freshwater Fishes Union
they get as far out of the road as possible. It
takes only one generation to lighten the color and
reduce the size, while a leisurely existence, free
from the possibility of a skirmish with a shark,

dunno ’is address, but yer bound to

“Lantana” : Bathurst (N.S.W.) has at
last swapped its royal mail-coach,, which opened its
service between Bathurst and Hill End at the time
of the big goldfinds, early in the ”70’s, for the
tnotor-car. For over 40 years the coach had carried
the mails daily to Sofala, and, latterly, three times
ia week to Hill End. Many a fight was put up from
it in the “Golden Seventies” against bushrangers,
and for years it had a heavy police escort. I'd like
to have all the parcels of gold and the famous
nuggets (especially the record-breaker from Beyers
and Holtermann’s find) that the old lumberer carried
into Bathurst.
“Werrimee”: Very little is heard nowa-
days of native bees, once plentiful in the eastern
timber-belt. They are smaller than the house-fly,
and, though stingless, are irritating things, swarm-
ing upon and crawling over one when their nest is
being robbed. The nests are usually in small dead
trees, and on an average fairly low down. There is
not a great quantity of honey in a nest, but it is
sweet and delicious. The comb is in globular lumps,
divided into numerous large cells, very different
from that of the ordinary bee. I have taken it from
trees in winter in a candied state. Two kinds of
native bee on the Richmond River are called cobbi
and boo-yan by the blacks. They are about equal in
size, but quite different in appearance. The hone}',
too, is different in appearance and flavor. So far as
1 know, there has never been any attempt to domes-
ticate these little workers, though I saw one nest
in Sydney Zoological Gardens. I don't think it
would be an easy task to keep them in hives, but
if the difficulties could be overcome their honey
would command fancy prices.
“E.S.S.” : Re the record price paid for a
dingo scalp the other day in Tenterfield (N.S.W.)
district —£60. The previous highest price was paid
for an albino, who came to be known as “Old
Snowy,” and who frequented a strip of country
between the Barcoo and Thomson rivers. So
strongly did he impress himself on the notice of the
pastoralists thereabouts that four of them subscribed
10 guineas each for his capture. Every resident in
that locality was on the warpath against “Snowy.”
They listened for his cheering voice at night; they
searched for his footprints on the cattle-pads and in
the beds of dry creeks; and they turned aside to
investigate whenever anything white caught their
eye in the distance. Still “Snowy” eluded them.
The quartette offered another guinea each, raising
the reward to 44 guineas ; and at that figure lie was
knocked down, the bullet of a persistent tracker
and watcher at last finding- its billet. Among
other big rewards, 20 guineas each was paid for
two dogs at Talmoi, near Moree (N.S.W.), in April,
1904. The reward in this case had been subscribed
by settlers who had suffered from the attentions of
the pair, and for several months pretty well -the
whole populace were hunting for the golden scalps.
They fell to a trapper named Hulin, who, after
being in pursuit of them for six weeks, got both
thieves in one night.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: “Ses” (B. 30/11/’l(5) says
that the -ground parrot and the spinifex parrot are
the only ground-nesting birds of the parrot tribe.
Not so. I can give him two more of this order that
patronise ground-floor maternity-homes. The “Beauti-
ful” parrakeet (Psephotus pulcherrimus) , which
inhabits the Queensland coastal belt, scoops out a
hole in a white ants’ nest and lays therein. I’ve
found many birds nesting in tree-termite homes,
but this rare parrot always sticks to the ants’ nests
on the basement. Number two that “Ses” missed
I’m not acquainted with, but Dr. Leach reports them
—the Rock parrots (Neophema petropliila), on Goat
Island, a small acre patch of limestone in the Aus-
tralian Bight. There this unique parrot nests on
the bare earth a few feet above high-water mark.
* _* * »
“J.S.N.” : Re the ’roo as a jumper. At a
drive (which was a regular Sabbath outing in the
’Bo’s and ’9o's), I have seen a young buck clear a
wing 11 feet high, and with apparent ease, too; and
with a dog at his heels I have seen a flier clear a
heap of fallen timber, making a jump of 34 feet.
I have measured the tracks of a ’roo
whose scalp was in danger, and the aver-
age jump down hill for over half a mile
was 24 feet. “Two Seas” advances as
evidence that the ’roo' is not a natural
jumper the fact that he is often found
caught between the top wires of fences.
The answer is that the animal cannot see
the wires ; very often he has been in the
habit of going between the posts before
-the wire was put in. A barbarous method
of capture in the early days was finely-
pointed hardwood stakes driven in the
ground at an angle of about 45 degrees
at a spot where the ’roo was in the
habit of jumping over a log fence to get to good feed
or water. Long knives fixed horizontally were also
used, with the result that when the ’roo landed on
them he was hamstringed.
“Merrigal”: “Barcoo” is right (B.
21/12/’l6) that Mitchell is the best drought-resister
among our grasses, but many pastoralists will demur
to the claim that it is the speediest condition-builder.
The opposition will argue that the more succulent
Blue and Flinders are the daddies in that respect. It
is common experience that stock depastured where
these three feeds flourish will leave Mitchell for the
last course, eating out the others first. The best
of “Barcoo’s” choice are the erect, handsome com-
mon Mitchell, the coarser and-taller “wheat-eared,”
and the decumbent, weeping or true Mitchell, whose
stems attain a length of six or seven feet. It was
the variety happacea, called Mitchell mulga by some
buslnnen, which the Yankees endeavored to natural-
ise. The likeliest way to ensure a good harvest of
Mitchell is to plant some grains of the better kinds
at midsummer-time- in a fairly moist and warm
seed-bed. The king Blue grasses are Andropogon
sericens, considered by some as the boss indigenous
tucker of Queensland ; Androp. erianthoidis, or satin-
topped ; and Androp.bombycinus , or silky heads.
The last is specially good for dry country. The hard-
est grass to kill I ever came on is the appropriately
named Nevertire of the Central Western Plains, but
the birds don’t make friends with it.
NO AUTHORITY.
THE NEW CURATE: “And now can you tell me who made the world, my little man?”
BILLY CORSTALK: “I dunno—it ions here when I come.”
“Ivoikoi-las” : The mystery long associated
with the nomadic Kukukukus who roam in the
shadows of the ranges behind the Gulf of Papua is
fast being cleared up. For years rumor credited
our cannibal brothers with the possession of tails,
and this libel, coupled with savage raids on the
coastal villages, gave them such notoriety that the
mere sight of them filled the hearts of their enemies
with fear. Recent visits of prospectors, however,
have proved the Kukukukus to be common or garden
bush-nigs with a taste for ornaments of human
bones. Tapa-cloth gave an appearance of tails.
Yet one fact is not explained. That is the custom
of falling in a fit at the sight of a white man.
Recently when Skellv, magistrate at the Oilfield,
entered a native haunt for the first time, he was
dumfounded when large, hefty Kuku bucks spon-
taneously took the count at the sight of him—
dinkum, too, as he found when applying restorative
measures.

“Corio”: Started shearing at Booberoi
this year, though 82 years of age. .Tack Harrison,
known along the Lachlan as “Old Union Jack,”
from his association with the big shearers’ strike
in the ’9o’s. The old man has been fleecing ’em
on and off for the last CO years, and claims to
have taken down, during that time, over 400,000
jumbucks.
“Pick”: In these days of the one-opera-
tion patent woolpress, the top over-lap woolpack
and few stitches to secure the bale, “Barcoo’s” re-
cord of 48 for one day’s work on a North Queensland
station may or may not take the damper. Under
old conditions a performance worth noting was that
of Jack Love and Bob Black, both men of over 60
shearings, who bagged the wool at Bibbenluke in
1882. They toiled with the spar-lever press, which
required hoisting and winding down twice for each
bale, and the tops were then palm-sewn the full
length of the four rims; yet the ancient grafters
dumped out 32 between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., knocking
off for dinner-hour and each joe-spell.
“Frank Mullavey”: Re Stevens', alias
Brown, who claims to have pressed 48 bales of wool
at Manuka (N.Q.).in eight hours. I am prepared
to say that this has never been done, and will
deposit £5O to say Stevens can’t do it, and a further
£5O to say that I will press more than he in any
eight hours and any shed he likes to pick.
“Reynard”: On the Barvvon near Collar-
endabri in December last year I saw a flock of about
-00 white ibis. I had never seen more than two or
three of this color together before, and then they
were always accompanied by a flock of the common
brown species. Will some Abo. say where the white
ibis nests ?
“Hill GO”: “Pick’s” par. (B. 11/1/17)
re Hewitt’s Crossing is interesting, but there is a
more interesting sequel to Hewitt's death. The general
opinion at the time was that when returning with the
horses he was cutting up some tobacco and stumbled
and fell on the knife. I always heard of the knife as a
clasp-knife, not as a butcher’s knife. The body was
buried close to where it was found by some of those
who knew Hewitt. While the grave was being dug
one of the bystanders picked up a lump of earth
just thrown out by the acting sexton. On examina-
tion it was found to contain gold, and a “rush” took

DRINKING.

“No, m’dear ( hie!). On’y half-drunk,

place almost before the funeral was concluded. Of
the subsequent history of Hewitt’s Crossing I am
hazy, but I believe good gold was found there.
Anyhow the field was worked for some time. I have
often heard weird stories of the spooks that were in
the habit of wandering about in the vicinity, but
never heard that the place was tapu to the teamster.

“Pick” : Remarkable forces of nature are
revealed when a wet season succeeds long periods of
drought. On the Monaro (N.S.W.) tablelands the
spring and summer of 1916 have been the dampest
in 30 years, and many grasses and herbs that were
believed to have entirely died out years ago now
reclotlie the hillsides. The corkscrew hill-grass again
waves its fields of arrowed prongs that perforate the
skins of the sheep until the pelts feel rough as glass-
paper, and the star-seeded blue-grass has taken pos-
session of the flats. Swamps long dry have reap-
peared, and with them have immediately sprung into
re-existence the radiant snapdragons that only the
old inhabitants can remember to have seen before.
Where lay their vitality- through all the years of
sunbake and wilt?
“Bud Australian’s” yarn :
Riding down Dogwood Creek one day I struck
a thin trail of flies coining out of the scrub near
Mic-k Ilourigan’s sliprails, and following the spoor
of the aviators 1 overtook old Jim Wilson trudging
along like a peripatetic beehive with the hind-
quarters of a kangaroo suspended from his neck.
M hen I came up with him he rested the butt end
of the y-enison on a stump and said, “By gum, ol’
man, yer jest tli’ bloke l want. Y’ see, ol' man, my
girl, Marth’, ’as snared a bloke sum’ ’ers down
Fpotipotpon way, an’ she’s brung th’ bloke an’ th'
blanky mish’nary along fer t’ make sure uv th’
poor coot w’ile ’e’s in th’ humor. Th’ bloke ‘e put
it ter me if 1 wuz ’greeable. Yes, by gum, ol’ man.
Wotyer think uv that, now? By- th’ sufferin' Punch
—but you know Marth’, don’t y’? Th’ mish’nary
bloke ses we gotter ’ave some reli’ble witnesses, so
yer jest in time, ol’ man.”
When we reached Jim’s bark humpy we found the
to-be bride and bridegroom and tin- parson and old
Bill the Splitter regaling themselves on fried spuds
and bacon and flapjacks and fresh honey in the
comb. The bloke was a big raw-boned slob with a
face like a tired working bullock. He wore red hair
and freckles as big as a half-crown on his face and
hands. He was dressed in a coarse galatea shirt
and brown moles. The bottoms of the moles were
tucked inside his bluchers and the rest of them
were kept in position by a greenhide strap with the
hair on ; a Yankee “wide awake” with a half-circle
of corks suspended from the outer edge of its wide
brim ; a strap with a small horse-shoe buckle around
his right wrist and a vacant grin completed his
outfit.
When the meal was over Marth’ cornered me and
asked me what 1 thought about him and without
waiting for an answer went on to tell me that he
had £65 in the bank, that he had paid 71 years’
instalments on the 80-acre selection, that he was
“sending 60 gallons to th’ fact’ry” and that his
mother had a lot of fine Brahmapootras, two houses
in the township, a “ten-acre paddick near the race-
course, an’ asthma, an’ rhoomatics, an’ anyway she
can’t last long.” Old Jim cut in, “Never mind
th’ • selecksliun, or the ol’ woman, or th’ blanky
bramerpooters. Jest ast yer bloke if ’e ’as got enny
tibaccer.” The bloke had some “tibaccer.” Old
Jim. cut the plug in two unequal parts, handed
back the smaller and nudged me in the ribs and
BILLY'S PATRONAGE.
BOSS (to Billy Aboriginal): "So yon are
going to Brisbane for a holiday, Billy?”
BILLY: “That right, boss. Which pub you
thinkit good one me stop?"
yvhispered, “By gum, ol’ man, ’e’s_notter bad lcin’er
bloke. But wetter time ’e’ll ’ave with Marth’ ?”
Then the parson lined the happy couple up and
started the ceremony; but the bridegroom was so
thickheaded that I had to take him in hand and
help him through. Still he seemed to be a bloke
with good business instincts when it came to the
finish. As the parson was handing the marriage
certificate over to the bride, his gills reached out
for it remarking, “ ’Ere, gimme another squint at
that blanky paper.” After considering it for a
minute or two he spat on the floor and said, “Tha’s
orright; it’s ezacklv th’ same kin’er receet wot I
got with th’ other two wimmen w-ot died on me.”
That little speech settled me after all the trouble
I had taken to see him put through in proper
shape; but as I climbed on to my horse old Jim
gasped out, “By gum, ol’ man, ’e’s a orright bloke,
’e is. Betyer life Marth’ 'as struck ’er Waterloo at
last.”
NO NEED TO GO TO EXTREMES.
LADY : "Now, I wish to conceal nothing."
SOLICITOR: “Pardon me just one moment, Madame. Remember I am a solicitor, not
a dressmaker .”
“Tiger” : Old Jim Millward (dead) took
most of the engines and machinery in to the mines
on the East Coast of Tasmania. His chief trouble
this is not an entry in the largest-team competi-
tion*—was when the pair of wheels on one side got
into a bog, which happened often, and, the whole
show capsized. Later on, he got two sticks 40 or
50 feet long, and fastened them under the waggon,
fore and aft, with a slight upward curve at the
fore end. This scheme prevented a capsize, for when
the side wheels sank down the load rested on the
timbers, and the 50 or 60 bullocks did the rest.
* * * *
“Lyndal Wood”: Reveille had sounded,
and Gunner Jim was back from his Christmas leave,
suffering from the night before. One of his mates
stuck his head in the tent. “Say, Jim, better pull
yourself together for. parade.” “No good ter me,”
groaned Jim. “Me feet is too light and me 'ead is
too ’eavy.”
“Biddy B.” : I know a rabbit-trapper who
owns a mare that will take some beating in the
memory stakes. Each evening the boss goes the
round of the burrows in his cart setting the traps,
and in the morning, without any help, the horse
will stop at every spot where a trap was planted.
If pulled up when driven along a road the mare will
stop at the same place next time she goes that way,
even if it’s six months after. The gift is hereditary,
too, for the lady has a daughter of four who is
almost as obliging.
* * * *
“Eddyson” : A love story of the Australian
bush, a small, brown, unvarnished fact. A brown
gill of 19, with brown, bare shins, sitting on brown
rocks by a stringy river. She is fishing patiently
in one of the few holes large enough to contain
a cod of moderate proportions. There is a brown
landscape to her left, and a browner to her right.
The landscape before her is brown, too, but that is
not visible, being obscured by a brown bank. A
mere tangle of shade from a hump-backed, Quilp-
lilce gum plays about the girl where she sits in a
brown study-, thinking drearily of the utter brown-
ness of her scorched existence. Suddenly- a man
appears on the top of the bank facing her —a very-
brown man in a few tatters of clothes scarcely
sufficient for decency. He looks a little like the
Quilpish gum, and throws a straggling shadow
towards her. But only for a moment. With a
whine like that of a hurt brute he prostrates him-
self dow-n the bank, sliding face foremost into the
water, clawing at it with mad greed. So he drinks,
his face buried; and the girl watches him, with
seeming dull eyes, stricken into a sort of stupor by
this tragic break in the long stupidity of things.
The man’s hands move as if making vague, ill-
directed efforts to lift his body. Bubbles break
about his ears. All the girl's faculties awaken, and
an instant later she is dragging the stranger's limp
body from the water. He is a gaunt creature, with
hollow- cheeks and burnt, blistered lips like a nasty-
wound in his thick, brown whiskers. His hair, too,
is brown and rusty with desert dust. The girl's
father helped her to carry him home, and for three
weeks Sarah nursed him. Brown had nearly done a
perish, but he lived and shaved, and eventually he
worked in w-ith Sarah’s old man, and in seven weeks
he reached the point. “You saved my life, didn’
yeh?” he said. “Well, I s’p’ose you’d ’ave
drownded,” Sarah replied. “That bein’ so, I reckon
„ou think I orter marry veh.” “Not if you ain't
feelin’ like it, Joe.” Brown clawed his back hair.
“Tell veil what,” he said. “I’ll toss yeh for it!”
He took out a penny. “ ’Eads 1 do, tails 1 don’t,”
said he, and tossed. It came head. “Bes’ two outer
three,” said Brown hastily, lie tossed once more,
and again it came head. “Well, I'm in for it,”
said Brown, and one arm embraced Sarah. “Yer
not!” retorted the girl. “If yeh didn’t want me
enough t’ know yeh wanted me, yeh can’t ’ave me.
I ain’t goin’ to be tossed for.” Brown grabbed her
in both arms. “Garn, yeh little fool,” he said
fondly. “look fer yerself.” It was a double-
headed penny. And they married, and do not appear
to know that there was ever either tragedy or
comedy in their brown lives.
‘‘Te Babarantiko”: The pandan or screw
pine, of which some 90 varieties exist, is particularly
plentiful and healthy
on the almost soilless
atolls of the Pacific.
Throughout the Cen-
tral and Eastern
Pacific a large number
of the sand-covered
coral dots would be
uninhabitable but for
the vegetable. The
cocoanut crop fails in
droughts—the pandan
crop practically never.
The brown people in-
sist that when the
cocoanuts fail the pan-
dan crop is better
than usual. When
both crops fail gaunt
hunger stalks. The
fruit is about the size
of a man’s head, is
exceedingly stringy and
has a distinct custard
taste. The harvest
season is a busy one.
All hands are lmsy-
gathering, boiling, bak-
ing and scraping the
yellow meat, mould-
ing it into long flat
cakes, and placing
them on mats in the
sun to dry. Thus
preserved the pulp
will keep almost inde-
finitely. Some grind
the dried fruit-cakes
to powder, and with
water this makes a
refreshing and nourish-
ing drink. Mixed, with prepared breadfruit, baked
pandan makes a highly nutritious rubber-like sub-
stance tasting very much like tigs.
“Choral”: Re “Two Seas's” aeroplaning
mare (B. 28/12/T6). He can cure the bad trick this
way. Get a thin wine bottle, fill it with water, cork
securely, tie to a stick sufficiently long to reach the
mare’s head, and when she rises up on her hind legs
bring it down with a good wallop between the ears
on the top of her skull. The breaking glass and
water running over her will scare all the nonsense
out of the jade for good. I have seen this done and
know it was most effective.
’’C.R.M." : The biggest shout-—many sizes
bigger than any that have been mentioned —was the
property of that old Hill End pioneer Louis Beyers,
of Beyers and Iloltermann fame. When he was
elected one of the three -members that i- (hose <i a v<
represented Mudgee in the X. S. Wales Assembly
he celebrated the event by shouting the Mudgee
Common a shipment of canaries and Angora goat-.
■Every William-goat of the common or garden variety
was shot, and after 20 years the Mudgee Common is
still perfumed by Angora. The canaries crossed with
various Small birds on the Common, and in my time
the sweetest of whistlers were on the Macquarie
River singing the praise of the lucky old miner.

“Pick”: On AEonaro (N.S.W.) since the
good season of 1916, on the rabbit-devastated areas
where grass has been rubbed out to the nethermost
root, there has sprung up wide and thickly-studded
fields of thistles of a variety never previously known
to the blue noses of that region. The newt hum vege-
table is a spidery, attenuated, but tallish-growing
specimen, with unharmful spines and a diminutive
pink and scanty blossom. The cottontails are the
only stock that touch the latest mark, and they devour
only the younger plants. What 1 would like to
know is whence came the innumerable seeds that so
suddenly sowed the large areas.
* * * *
‘‘New Chum” : I’d like to ask whether any-
body knows of anything that will prevent mosquitoes
biting me at night. I sleep on a verandah where
there’s a lot of creeper. 1 don’t want anybody to
mention eucalyptus, oil of lavender, oil of citronella
or any of the advertised preparations, for I’ve tried
them. Nor need anybody tell ifie about burning

while taking the second box I passed two-large rough stones
covered with sharp-pointed crystals. This happened on Decembei

but not half so bad as I would imagine an operation would be and

“As I was so wonderfully cured, she thought she would try De
Witt’s, with what both she and I consider wonderful results. Mie

pills the back-breaking pain disappeared. . Since then she has been
quite well, she has not had the return of the pain, and the bladder

permanently cured and does he remain well? . j nnr i savs
Mr. Watts writes in August, 1915, nearly two years afterwaids, a • • ■

debt of gratitude to this excellent remedy, for they have completely cured me
of mv old kidney and bladder trouble.”
f How was it that Mr. Watts was cured after these stones bad been forminf
for so many years? We know he took De Witt s Kidney and natural
but what was it caused the stones to be passed away in an aimost natural
manner ? It was this-De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills go stmi|ht to

The average time-payment agreement is
as deadly as a cartload of prussic acid Ihe
other day a peaceful Melbourne fruiterer
named White was called to court to say
why he should hot pay ; £2 ss. to one Ilaivey
whom -he had never before seen or heard ot.
The matter ultimately boiled down to this.
Long ago Harvey had bought a waggon at
auction and then sold it to one Bean for
£2B on t.p. Bean paid oft £24 Ids. and then
sold it to one Silver, who after a while
passed it on for a consideration to \\ n e.
It was nicely painted and properly hung,
but it bore no notification about it that it
. till carried a debt of £3 55., so White scoffed
at Harvey’s claim. The Court, however,
assured him that the t.p. rweement was
still sound and in good wo ng oidei, and
he had to part up. Yet lie was lucky in a
way. If Bean had sold the turnout while
owing £27 on it. White would have had to
nay that much for a waggon that he had
already paid Silver for; even if he had dis-
owned the thing and dumped it on the Cor-
poration tip lie would still have had to pay
whatever was owing. In fact, the ordinary
tp. agreement is like the undertaker .
follows its victim to the grave and there is
no escape from it.

“Corio”: Nominators of pubs past and
present forgot the King’s Head,-which is pro-
bably the oldest hotel in Australia. Built
in the year 1820 at Liverpool (N.S.W.) it
still fills the till under the sign of Tatter-
sail’s Bar. No additions or alterations have
been made since it was erected —a mere J<
years ago.
The Australian member of Parliament has
all sorts of uses. One of him the other daj
received this note :
Pies mister will you give my little boy two schil-
lings as i was laid up lars nite, and 1 will pay 5
when i get me bonus.
* *
“Croson”: Toy-making promises such a
remunerative field for disabled soldiers that
it is a pity the undertaking should fail tor
want of a little commonsense. Those thus
engaged in helping our returned soldiers
have so far been buying expensive woods
for their raw material, whereas the Hun,
when he supplied Australia with toj s,
planted his factory alongside a timber-yard
and used only the waste. And one big mill
in Melbourne burns and gives away 200 tons
of timber waste daily.
* * * * .
“Snell”: The usual report of several
Christmas geese at Ballarat and Bendigo
having yielded nice little shows of gold when
their crops were panned off, reminds me of
mv father’s yarn of the Chow at the 8011-
sliaw (Vic.). The Celestial was discovered
endeavoring to force a strong emetic down
the neck of a protesting rooster ; and when
asked “Wlia’ for?” John replied: Him
Mother got plenty gold inside last week.
Ghosts can pass through a keyhole, but
the Sliepparton (Vic.) magistrate has ruled
that a farmer can’t live in one —even it he
is a closer settler. A thistle inspector had
put a “notice to cut” in the keyhole of the
defendant’s door, but the magistrate ruled
that the keyhole was not the thistle-fancier s
abode or part thereof, as required by law,
and that the notice would have to be served
again. - # *
Mary Gilmore elaborates her scheme:
In regard to the fruit that is taken to the tips by
the ton, why should not pulping plants be established
at the Fruit Markets as a part of every municipal
scheme ?
Every year we have this intolerable waste along-
side an equally intolerable want of fruit and fruit-
pulp in small households.
If fruit is a necessity, why let it rot. Why not
use it?
If the fruit were constantly shot mto pulping pans
as it began to soften the markets would be much
more wholesome places to attend. If the pulp were
distributed at a small cost by the quart to people
bringing their own cans (as disinfectant is already
distributed at most Town Halls) there would be a
minimum need of storage. Hotels, hospitals, etc.,
could be supplied in hulk. The boiling need not
he excessive. None of the jam-makers having a
“run,” and supplying customers weekly, boil their
jam for long keeping. To do so would be as foolish
as salting the daily fresh meat or' butter, or con-
densing the milk for long keeping. If these can be
run out and sold as perishables, surely fruit-pulp can
be run out and sold in the same way 1
On the other hand, households wanting jam tor
keeping could finish the pulp off at home with
sugar. It would save thousands of women the
trving time over a hot stove that they now spend,
in the first hours of jam-making. Also it would
reduce the importation of foreign canned fruits.
Undoubtedly the fruit and jam rings will urge (as
has already been done) that pulping would not pay
or it would have been started long ago. That argu-
ment applied to fruit markets and jam factories
themselves once. Indeed, it applied at some time
to every industry and invention the world has seen.
It merits no consideration as an honest objection
from anyone.
What does merit consideration is the value such
pulping would be to women, to households and to
institutions generally and its effect as an agent
for encouraging fruit-growing by reducing waste.
These are things of importance, socially and eco-
nomically. “Fruit to the tip" is not only poor
encouragement to the unfortunate grower, but is
commercial sabotage.
The community which burns food, making no
effort to save it, has no right to gaol members of
the I.W.W. or anybody else for advocating or even
practising incendiarism.
* * * *
“Canuck” : The Vic. Railway Department
is alleged to approve of daylight saving, but
it isn’t rushing things. Its regulations and
instructions have been drawn up after
mature consideration, wherefore its officers
are neither expected nor allowed to act on
their own initiative —that is, to use their own
savvy. This explains why the Sunday train
from Fern Tree Gully to Melbourne is still
lit on leaving at 7.20 p.m., though it has
reached the city and is almost back again
before dusk.
“Briner” : Money in sailing ships? Don’t
mention it. At Melbourne recently there
was the Risor. She was sold in 1911 for
£3600 and in 1915 for £14,500-£l 0.900
advance. Another lying at Melbourne was
the Leif Gundersen, formerly the Bannock-
burn, and 30 years old. In 1906 she
brought £6000; lately she was purchased
for £53,250!
“D.F.” ; The first timber used for cabinet-
making in Australia was probably the now
nearly extinct and shamefully-used red cedar
of N. S. Wales. It was spotted soon after
the first settlement, and as early as 179.)
Captain Dell, of the ship Fancy, took some
logs of it from the Ilawkesbury to England.
But I can’t got on to the track of what was
done with them.
From Back of Everywhere: —
All modern improvements arc not improvements,
as witness the tinned-meat receptacle. When the
first non-tin-opener variety appeared it had a special
strip of tin soldered around between the tin and
the lid. It was indeed a boon. Turn the key round
and the strip came off as easily as the skin from a
banana, and" the lid fell out. Then someone got
“improving,” also cheapening, and the modern tin
only has a tag of the tin itself protruding. In
about three cases out of four when you turn the
key the tag runs to a sharp point after going about
two inches, and breaks off. There will have to be at
least one extra paddock in Hades for the victims of
this occurrence. The old pre-historic tin, with no
patent opener at all, was better than this variety,
because in the old days you knew you had to carry
a tin-opener, axe, circular saw, dynamite oi some-
thing, whereas now. the patent tin-opener kids you
that you don’t want anything, and then lets you
down.
“Black Pearl” : “I haven’t got any labor
troubles,” said the pearler as he returned a
black gem to the tobacco-tin. “It’s this way.
Labor costs me fourpence a day per man, and
they find themselves. They work when they
like, and play when they like. Still the work
gets done. Another thing that does not
worry me is the cost of living. Of course, it
has gone up. My suits, which used to cost
me about six or seven shillings, now cost 10
bob. But I’ve got a five-roomed two-storey
house up there, and it only cost me five
pounds! Then I've got a whole teak forest
further north and west on a 121 years’ lease.
I’m going to do my best to see the lease right
out, as it is such a good proposition that it
would be a pity to die and leave it to some-
one else. The first year you pay no rent, and
the next year you pay in accordance with
the number of years it will take to raise a
crop. Thus if you are going to grow cocoa-
nuts it will take you eight years to do it.
Therefore, the first year you would pay
nothing at all, the second year one-eighth ot
the annual rental; the third year a quarter
of the rental, the fourth three-eighths, and
so on. It is not until the ninth year that
you have to pay the full rental. And yet
you people stay here and try to grow sugar
and mine coal! You make me fatigued.
I’m going back to my Tropic island next
week.”
* * *
“F.N.T,” : This is a free and independent
country—in spots. Consider the indepen-
dence of those who serve the outer-suburban
householder. The butcher, baker, grocer and
vegetable-man are all in competition with
other tradesmen delivering goods, wherefore
their employees don’t worry the houseboss
for a Christmas-box. The “authorised news-
agent, dustman and sanitary-person, how-
ever, are different. They show their inde-
pendence, and the householder’s dependence
on their goodwill, by leaving cards demanding
a donation, and if the occasion seems to de-
mand it they call around in person for the
good a.

“Every well-primed cheque is a better weapon of
destruction than a 12-inch shell.” —Lloyd George.
The foeman keeps the field; but times are moving.
The end draws surely near, the die is cast.
Our credit stands unbroken, plainly proving
The triumph of our principles at last.
Unarmed, unready, making large-mouthed boasting,
We waited for the foeman’s steel-edged blow,
The hate-urged flame that gave our side a roasting
And taught us all of war we want to know.
Our old idea, the notion that enslaved us
To peace umbrellas, guarding holy greed,
Will when the final word is said have saved us,
However guns may roar or nations bleed.
’Tis true that preparation might have aided
To break the foe and loose his strangle-hold,
To save the ravaged lands that first he raided ,
But now we turn again to faith in gold.
Fling in the cheques. Cash talks in tones of thunder.
Though armies fail, this truth at last prevails.
The Teuton tightens up his belt in wonder
Before the blast of our financial gales.
Blow high ! Blow low ! With five per cent, we smite
him.
Our millions'take the field at 95.
The Kaiser crumbles and the cold months write him,
With bash on bash, the biggest ass alive.
He thought to quell the stubborn gilt-edged paper;
He dreamed the sword was mightier than, the pen
That signs the cheque that bids the round earth caper
And floods the pay-sheets of the race of men.
Out on the heretic ! Our faith unshattered
Remains through all the blood and stoush and
smash.
Fling in the cheques ! No factor ever mattered
In peace or war except the solid cash !

POLITICAL
POINTS
The papers —all the Fat, un-Australian
ones—which are screaming about the
“infamy” of displacing Hughes because of
Ms “patriotism” have short memories.
They forget that Fisher and Hughes dis-
placed some other crowd after the war
started because of the other crowd’s patriot-
ism. Cook and Millen were carrying on
the Australian end of the war in their way.
Fisher and Hughes and Pearce said it
wasn’t the right way, and threw them out.
If no man should be thrown out for holding
what the majority regards as the wrong
brand of patriotism, then Hughes is a mere
usurper, after all.
Deputationising the Minister of Defence,
C. J. Bennett, ex-president of Melbourne
Trades Hall Council, said he “saw no reason
why our workers should not participate in
the standardised shipbuilding programme
now commencing in Britain and America.”
The Bulletin can, though. Had we the
equipment and the trained mechanics we
could have put millions in our pockets these
last two years and given the Allies more
help, too. And the chief reason why we
haven’t is the Australian elector’s habit of
sending Freetraders, fiscal sinkers and other
shirkers to Parliament. Also Labor leaders
like Bennett promptly discarded their
representatives when they broke a promise
they didn’t make and battled for Conscrip-
tion ; but they sat mute as mice when the
same representatives broke a promise they
did make, to give Australia a real Protective
tariff. That is largely why our shipyards
are not working three shifts.
Says the S. M. Herald
A thing which seems clear is that there is an
organised attempt to prevent Mr. Hughes from
going to London as the Commonwealth’s representa-
tive, and it has becorne apparent of late that there
are influential men who are lending themselves to
this unworthy scheming.
There are three reasons why Mr. Hughes
should go to London as the Commonwealth’s
representative:—-
(1) He doesn’t represent the Commonwealth.
What he declared to be the vital part of his pro-
gramme was turned down. I
(2) He doesn’t represent the House of Reps. His '
party .there is the smallest of three parties.
(3) He doesn’t represent the Senate. His party
there is so small that, with the Liberal party added,
it doesn’t equal the party in direct opposition.
What better arguments could anyone want
to prove that any “organised attempt” to
stop Mr. Hughes from going to England is
“unworthy scheming”?
“P.X.”: If his health is good enough,
what about Deakin as Australia’s represen-
tative at the Imperial Conference? An Aus-
tralian with an Australian outlook, he
represented his State at the very first
British Imperial Conference ever held, back
in ISB7, ,and has had sane views on the
subject always. And his honesty has never
had a Heck upon it.
The story of red-tape and a horse: —
A horse was wanted by an official to drag him
about in a buggy, and as another official owned a
buggy-horse the animal was hired at 255. a week
and started work. After £75 had been paid for hire
and the moke had consumed £22 worth of feed,
somebody said it was suffering from glanders;
whereupon it was shot and incinerated, and the
owner handed, a cheque for £25. Expenditure on
horse for 14 months £122; assets nil. Before the
•cremation ceremony specimens of mucous membrane
and part ,of the gland were appropriated and sent
to a laboratory. Verdict: no glanders. Meanwhile
the expiry of horse No. 1 left a vacancy, and Red-
tape? promptly hired another at 255. a week. After
\ the. bill for horses 1 and 2 had moved up beyond
£2OO, it struck the administrative mind that it
might be cheaper to buy a beast straight out, and
at a‘ cost of £22 one was acquired—and the end
of it all was a statement showing: Expenditure,
£222 ; assets, 1 horse.
Somewhere in Egypt or Mesopotamia? No!
Merely a transaction incidental to the con-
struction of Canberra.
THE TRUE SIGN.
JOE: “Wof’s that feller Dwyer, Jim? The
other coves say ’e’s a bricklayer or a
carpenter!”
JIM: “’E ain’t no blanky bricky or blanky
carpenter! Why, ’e’s a toff —’ e’s a
hooky’s clerk!”
The Federal parties having decided that
party must still rule, the only thing for the
democratic politician to do is to go to the
country and find out which party it shall be.
Durack, the new leader of the N. S. Wales
State Labor party, has a lot of things to
learn yet. He blundered up to Broken Hill
the other day to help a local man named
Brookfield win Cann’s old seat, and found
Brookfield howling at the top of his voice
for the release of the I.W.W. fire-bugs and
noisily associating himself with practically
all the wild-man ideas that the Labor party
has been carefuly repudiating. If he hadn’t
blundered into the lion’s den Durack wouldn’t
have been expected to say a word. As it
was he couldn’t denounce Brookfield without
raising a howl in Broken Hill and he
couldn’t support Brookfield without raising
a howl everywhere else ; so the young man
who is short of a wily old pilot found he
had urgent public engagements somewhere
else, and crept away with the awful remark
that “while he had said nothing in support
of Mr. Brookfield, he hoped they would also
notice that he had said nothing that could
possibly be construed as against him.”
Which is what the old hand often does, but
never what he says.
The Victorian Parliamentary Decentralisa-
tion Committee lately sent to all the munici-
palities in the State asking them if their

population is growing, and if not why not.
Hamilton remarks in reply that one reason
why it is wilting is that Portland, the
natural deep-water harbor for south-western
Victoria, is steadily kept from serving that
purpose. The calamitous State Government
has spent £240,000" on a breakwater there,
not to mention other odds and ends, and
when a request was made that wheat grown
a few miles from Portland should be shipped
there instead of being dragged to Geelong or
Williamstown, the best the Minister could
say was that a tramp steamer might call at
Portland if one turned up. It hasn’t turned
up yet, and Hamilton might have added, but
didn’t, that when the ketch Hawk was actu-
ally at Portland, and proposed to take a few
tons of wheat to Tasmania, it was made
worth its while to go to Williamstown for
the cargo.
The S. M. Herald has been foaming at
the mouth for a week. While the fusion of
the Liberals and the Hughesraelites would
result in a National Government, for the
Labor party to support the Liberals in turn-
ing Mr. Hughes out “would be a piece of
political infamy without a parallel in this
or any other British country.” The Liberals,
the S. M. Herald says, are a “win the war”
party; so to put a “win the war” partv
into power would be a piece of political
infamy without paretcetera. It seems a fair
thing for the Berliner Sausagezeitung
to say. But how the professedly loyal S. M.
Herald is going to justify herself for say-
ing it. Heaven and Mr. Hughes only know.
The Herald certainly doesn’t.

If Woodrow Wilson believes in peace
without victory, why did he send the
National Guard to Mexico?
Nearly 12 months ago Lloyd George told
us that we could help the Allies to win the
war by ceasing to loaf on them. But, in-
stead of supplying us with a tariff which
would have compelled us to get to work, the
Government stuffed the question out of
sight, with the result that the British Gov-
ernment has now had to tell us that wo
cannot have any more steel, brass or copper
unless the applications for export are recom-
mended by the Defence Department. No
more bitter comment upon the policy of the
Australian Government and Parliament

A recent return showing the number of
houses sewered by Melbourne’s Board of
Works discovers the surprising fact that
there are in the metropolitan area —and
that doesn’t go a great way out —no less
than 31,566 acres with but one tenement to
five or more acres, and 5428 acres with but
one house to every three acres. This in-
cludes the public parks; but they don’t
make up half the total area. In the 50
square miles of the larger blocks there are
barely 39 houses to the mile. And yet
some landlords in Carlton are squeezing
the authorities to allow them to put shan-
ties on allotments the size of a tablecloth!
ODE ON BILL’S BIRTHDAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Awake, arise and shout!
Let gloom be put to rout
And gladness reign!
Avaunt, despair and doubt!
Our hearts are warm and stout,
-Our fists have still a clout,
Our path is plain.
Bill smiles, and ail is well.
The rousing birthday yell
Hits the bleak sky!
Let every Teuton tighten up his belt!
The sun will shine, the bitter frost will melt
And men will die,
Through the green gas and red destroying flame,
To the eternal honor of his name.
Lead out the pageant and the show,
As suits a universal woe —•
The thing he made that still must grow.
Let every German statesman start to blow,
And let the blood of all the nations flow,
And let a million widows speak the thing they know
As gift for him this day.
For the fierce, spring the tiger crouches low,
The submarine creeps through the undertow —
Let us be gay !
Loud upon a blither flute
Beerily let someone toot.
Bring the little Belgian child
1 n its mother’s blood defiled !
Bring the ravished Flemish maid,
Mad with shame!
Bring the aged dead ye laid
In the farmstead’s ruined shade
That high honor may be paid
To his name!
Lift a merry throat and sing
To the warrior, Kaiser, king—
lie who made the splendid thing,
Wrought it all in blood and flame.
Abdul sends a greeting loud ;
Bulgars in his pride are proud ;
Even Austria in her shroud
Feigns a birthday smile.
Wilson sends a timid word ;
Constantine, by vague hope stirred,
Smirks in stealthy guile.
Bring your gifts ! ’Tis ours to send
Something large and free,
Something that delight may lend
To the pageantry—•
We who for his pleasure spend
Blood by land and sea.
Here’s the best that we can do,
Something fresh and clean and new
For his birthday show —
Our tremendous lOU,
Signed in bitter, lasting red
For the living and the dead.
In a year or in a day
In his war-coin we shall pay
Everything we owe!

CONGESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Alderman Blue, speaking of the congestion in
suburban cemeteries, said that Governments did not
think much of those who were likely to die. Only
the living had a vote.”
Little the space I ask for here.
A simple view of life is mine.
Leave me a kiss, a little beer,
The wherewithal to sleep and dine,
And you can take and keep the rest —
Wealth is a noxious sort of jest.
In grassy roads the cattle graze
A mile from where the toilers sleep;
But men must seek the crowded ways
A few sparse coins by sweat to reap.
Close packed in crowded tram and train,
They go and they return again.
Wide is the land and broad the sky,
. But not for us the breadth and space,
from birth until the hour we die
We crush like wethers in the race
With scarce a hat-brim’s width' between
The solid fat and sordid lean.
Still with a grin we must endure.
All pathways lead to Sydney town.
For breath and bread the squeeze is sure
Till to the grave we trundle down.
But there our peace who dares to spoil?
We claim the right to worms and soil.
Alas! Congestion holds the tomb!
With all the breadth of landscape free,
My own select, exclusive doom
Ts shamefully withheld from me.
A bor e my corpse ten others bloat
Because the dead men have no vote.

MOTOR TYRE INSURANCE.
Each year tyre users are more alive to the possi-
bilities and benefits of tyre care. Nowhere is the
old saying, “A stitch in time saves nine,” more
fitting than in its application to automobile tyres.
The mos't insignificant repairs, if made in time, add
immeasurably to tyre mileage. Not a few motorists
have been carrying a certain few accessories, loose
in their ears at all times, to cope with tyre acci-
dents, but until now there has appeared no recollec-
tion of tyre accessories into one kit, under one cover,
adequate for all emergencies. Now several companies
are putting up repair necessities in compact form,
and among others the Goodyear Tyre-Saving Kit has
been inaugurated, containing a number of first-aid
appliances, put up neatly in a khaki-colored roll.
The outfit takes its name from the function of the
materials composing it—which is to save tyres.
Hence the name Tyre-Saver Kit. Its cost to the
tyre owner is trivial —the service and convenience
obtained from it are tremendous. Practically ail
tyre manufacturers have long pointed out the dangers
of under-inflation, and publish tables of inflation
pressures, which, if followed, will insure additional
mileage. The pressure gauge in the Tyre-Saver Kit,
if used as directed, will properly regulate inflation.
If some sharp stone or piece of glass should cut the
tread of the tyre, it should be quickly repaired with
Tyre Putty. When, a tyre is changed the possi-
bility of friction between the canvas and the inner
tube is lessened by sifting talc in the tyre, and
every motorist should have a supply of the best
talc for this purpose. There are also inside and
outside patches to combat blow-outs, self-cure patches
for quick repairing of punctured inner tubes, fric-
tion tape for bare ignition wires, and valves to
replace possible leaky ones, all included in the vari-
ous outfits now being marketed. — Advt.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
In rejecting the entry. of a horse owned
by a member of the A.R.C. committee, the V.R.C.
committee has indirectly proclaimed the inefficiency
of its own stipendiary stewards, while casting a
painful reflection on turf-governing powers in
another State. Blue Bolt, the two-year-old in
question, is nominated by Dr. Bennett of Adelaide.
The youngster came to Melbourne at the end of
last year and ran a bad race at Moonee Valley.
Ten days later he reversed this form at Caulfield,
whereon the stipes held an inquiry and delivered
judgment as follows: “We are not satisfied with the
marked improvement shown by Blue Bolt as between
Moonee Valley and Caulfield, but have decided to
take no action in the matter. We think that L.
Fisher (the jockey) did his best at Moonee Valley.”
A week later Blue Bolt put up a clinking perform-
ance at Flemington. This was certainly not a
fresh cause of complaint against the horse’s owner.
It was the running at Moonee Valley that gave
cause for suspicion. The three paid stewards of
the V.R.C. had taken no action in that matter
immediately after the race, nor had they been
game to find anybodj' g'uilt.v when they made their
belated inquiry at Caulfield. They merely said
they didn’t think the jockey was accountable for
Blue Bolt’s evil-smelling performance at Moonee
Valley. The V.R.C. committeemen couldn’t under
these circumstances take action against anyone' con-
nected with Bide Bolt unless they were prepared
to reprove their precious stipes for not having made
someone suffer. The committee's rejection of the
Blue Bolt entries for the V.R.C. Autumn Meeting
is one way of taking action against the owner and
a very unsatisfactory way. If his nag deserved to
be disqualified for one particular meeting, it de-
served disqualification for all meetings. If the
V.R.C. committee could do this thing on January
24 in punishment for an alleged offence committed
on December 16, why did it allow the same Blue
Bolt to start for the race he won at Flemington on
January 1 ? Turf tribunals never dream of temper-
ing justice with consistency, or injustice with logic.
They simply do the things they ought not to have
done and leave undone the things they ought to
have done, and there is no horse-sense in them.
* * * *
The rain frustrated an attempt to hold a
pony meeting at Fitzroy (Vic.) last week. After
two events had been farcically decided —the jockeys
holding one another up during the races—the circus
was postponed. It was the shortest pony programme
on record. As the naughty flat-ites had jumped the
fences and inextricably mingled themselves with
the haughty grand-standers, returning the money to
the crowd was next to impossible. At the adjourned
meeting, to make things square, the course was
thrown open free, and then no one could tell the
flats from the sharps, so to speak.
Two of F. A. Conolly’s horses —PMbarra
and Corstep—went back to Westralia last week,
after doing badly in Melbourne for a year and more.
They wijre whispered of with great respect when
they first came to Victoria, but some of the punters
said awful things about them before they went
away.
* * * *
Rosehill trainer Booth served up a couple
of winners at the A.J.C. Anniversary meeting on
Friday. These were Dame Acre, bred by the owner
of Wolaroi, and the imported horse Rushford, owned
by G. S. Yuill, and lately transferred from another
stable. Of these the lady, a recent winner at Rose-
hill, had not done too well at Randwick. In the
Challenge Stakes early in the week she melted out
near the turn. She was backed down to 3’s in that
race. On Friday, with the same weight (7st. 111 b.),
and in a field of rather less quality, she derived so
much assistance from having the wind astern or
something that she hopped over the six furlongs in
“121,” after being backed at 5 to 1 and 9 to 2.
It was a close thing for Dame Acre, for Inia, who
had also tired away to nothing in the Challenge,
was only just snuffed out. It was one of those races
which make the punter reflect that if there was less
upcertainty in racing he could win a lot of cash.
**■*«•
Lilyman, who had ridden Dame Acre and
Desert Malt, was aboard Rushford (7st, 121 b.) on
the Anniversary Handicap. For this The Fortune
Hunter was a solid favorite on the strength of his
win in the Summer Cup, with Narivo at 6 and 7
and Rushford 8 to 10, the rest tailing off to any old
price. At the finish the crowd saw the nag which
carried most of its money easily beaten, Rushford,
starting from the extreme outside, quickly reached
the rails in third position from Karanaud King and
Dave Whitton. There he stayed till the leaders
turned it up when moving into the straight. The
favorite struggled out of the mob opposite the Leger
and made a stayer’s effort to overtake the horse in
front, but never saw anything but his tail. Rush-
ford won by three lengths without being pressed.
He ran the mile and a half in “32-J,” which is
gOod enough for most occasions. Rushford won at
Rosehill last month, and at Tattersall’s meeting
finished fourth in Chantlemere’s Cup with Bst. 21b.
Incidentally, he is nominated for the Australian and
Sydney Cups.
* * * *
The success of Rushford gave the owner
of the horse his first big success, and, incidentally,
another Pommy added his name to the winners of
Australia’s richest handicaps. The nag was unlucky
to lose the Summer Cup. Ridden by Connell, he
was going great guns in that event until a stirrup-
leather broke, and the rider, in order to preserve his
balance,, had to take his other foot out of the iron.
In Chantemerle Cup he got a terribly bad passage.
One way and another, Payton thus had horrible luck
with this beast.
* * * *
Aberlady, who just scratched a race out
of the fire at Randwick, is by Tartan-C'arinthia, and
therefore full sister to Tail liter. She may be some-
thing out of the ordinary run. It was only great
courage "and speed over the last furlong that brought
‘her alongside Trepid.
Some of the mokes that are produced in
novice races at Randwick are pretty slick. The
public saw one or two on 'Friday. One of them was
Trepid, who started with 24 others in the Granville
Stakes at Rosehill a fortnight before,' and was beat-
ing two of them at the finish. Another was Aberladj,
who had shown impressive ability to hurry up. On
Friday Trepid hopped away quickly, and was six
lengths ahead at the distance. But here she began
to wish it was over, and Aberlady, coming on in the
last 100yds., just got up in time to prevent a -0
to 1 chance bringing joy to the house of Abraham.
The mile was run in “39j.” Pretty good for novices.
When next day arrived Trepid, feeling refreshed
by the run, proceeded to Moorefield, and proceeded
to get back what had been missed the previous aftei-
noon. In the Kogarali Stakes, a mile, she had been
accommodated with 6st. 71b. in a field of moderates,
and going to the front at half-way gave an imita-
tion of Balarang winning the Carrington Stakes.
The next animal was six lengths astern. In the Carl-
ton Mile a 71b. penalty brought her weight to vst.
71b., and as the rider, apprentice O’Connor, got < lb.
allowance, it didn’t matter. This time the public
liked Tony and La Balfour at 5 to 4 better than
Trepid at 3 to 1. That didn’t matter either. The
interval at the end this time was 10 lengths, though
there were perhaps one or two not in a hurry to
reduce it when they noticed what was happening.
Trepid had run in Victoria without creating much
excitement, and may not be a champion, but she was
feeling mighty well last week.
Narivo, winner of Tattersall’s Denman
Stakes at a nice long price on December 30, put up a
mile performance in the A.J.C. Anniversary Handi-
cap, and a lot of people lost their money backing
him. But they backed him solidly again at Moore-
field on Saturday in the mile-and-quarter event, the
best price at the death being 7 to 4. He let them
down again. The winner turned up in Wirrilla, who
just staggered in a head before Challenge Cross.
Wirrilla is a hard-toiling veteran. He was foaled
16 years ago, and looks as 'if he might hurry-up
again at any time. Narivo is a long way from being
a punter’s horse, though he may yet spring a surprise
on the stable when it forgets to back him, just to
make up for losing when the money is up. When
Kelso bought Narivo for 800 gjiineas, Booth, the
trainer of Rushford, went up to the seventh. cen-
tury. On Anniversary Day Booth had a notion that
Rushford would be among ’em at the finish, but sue-
pected that Narivo would win.

About the most consistent two-year-old
seen in Sydney this season is Lady Comely. She has
won three races at Randwick and been second in
another. Her last win was on Friday, when she took
the Second Nursery at Randwick, carrying 9st.,
coming through a good field from behind and landing
the goods in easy style. Lady Comely looks like
getting a bit of distance, consequently it may be as
well to remember her when nags are a year older.
Charlemagne 11. and Comely landed her a generous
share of good looks.
“Bet” : Here’s something new. A Sydney
bookmaker has developed what looks like philan-
thropy ; but is it ? A man wishing to back a horse
straight out asks for the price, gets it, and is inci-
dentally informed that if he will accept two points
under the odds he will get his money back should his
horse finish second or third. At first blush it looks
great, but I suppose it's safe to bet your life that
Mo has a bit the better of it somehow. Last week a
punter took £5OO to £2O Dame Acre and The
Fortune Hunter, Flying and Anniversary Handicaps.
Dame Acre won and The Fortune Hunter was second.
The punter received his £2O back.
“Trot” : Has anyone reminded the racing
clubs around Sydney that when they put the totalisa-
tor in they need not confine the machine to opera-
tions on single races, but could run a machine on
the side to give punters on “the double” a chance?
If the M.L. experience is worth anything and the
rotten prices available to a doubles punter from the
books any guide, you can take it as certain that a
two-race machine would give the clubs a lot of
revenue and the public something worth taking notice
of. The C.J.C., at Christchurch, tried the experi-
ment. It was a great success. The dividends ran
into hundreds. One I can remember was £791, or
thereabouts, on a combination as to which Ikey had
been venturing 100 to 4 in limited volume. The
scheme was dropped in M.L. only because the books
and wowsers raised a loud yell about “the encourage-
ment of gambling,” and into an amendment of the
Gaming Bill then before Parliament a line was
dropped to keep them quiet. Will the A.J.C. take
notice ?
-X- * * *
“H.R.”: What won’t they gamble on!
The recruiters are getting posters put in prominent
places on the racecourses Where the “Noes” do con-
gregate. At Randwick the other day a group of
healthy-looking males of military age faced one of
these bills. “I bet a level quid they get 500 in
New South Wales this .week,” said one game lad
with a wave of his hand towards the printed appeal
for fighters. “I bet they don’t get 450,” retorted
another sport. A bookmaker in the group woke up
and started to book bets which will make him safe
whoever wins, with a chance of a double win if the
recruiting figures go up to between 450 and 500.
* * * *
“0.K.” : Tatt.’s sweep is forbidden by one
of its license conditions to communicate the names
and addresses of ticket-holders, and it protests that
communications to owners are never made from the
office in Hobart or by any authorised agent of Tatt.
The ticket-holders themselves may “approach” the
horse-owners, but they never do it with the assist-
ance or connivance of the firm that holds the boodle.
So far, so good. Yet connivance of Tatt. in the
agreements between anxious ticket-holders and
“approached” owners is an actual fact, all the same.
Nor could the blackmail scandal exist without it.
Tatt. is open to receive authority from a ticket- ,
holder, before the race, 're the paying over of a pro-
portion of the prize-money to the horse-owner in the
event of his horse winning. Also, Tatt. -puts a limit
on his authority as a go-between by refusing to pay
more than a third of the,. prize-money to anyone save
the holder of the winning ticket. Now, if Tatt. re-
fused to pay any prize-money to anyone save the
person who won it from the sweep—if, in short,
Tatt. declined to be a party to agreements concerning
tickets —the blackmailers would find themselves
baulked, if not altogether euchred, in their designs.
Better still, if horse-racing had nothing to do with
the gamble, and the sweeps on Cups and handicaps
were converted into cash lotteries, blackmailing
could not be practised. Where there are no means to
do ill-deeds the ill-deeds can’t be done.
Two ex-featherweights, Blew Edwards,
the Englishman, and Jimmy Hill, the top-notch
Sydneysider, met in the lightweight class at the
Rushcutter’s Bay Stadium on Saturday, The pro-
ceedings were swift and calamitous/ Hill is a
very accomplished boxer, Edwards a less spectacular
but quite as effective boxer and a puncher into the
bargain. What happened to Hill is w’hat usually
occurs to him when lie meets anyone with a smite
which doesn’t miss. He did well in the first round;
but Edw'ards was always after him. In the second
he did well again—until he attempted another
of those hit-and-jump-away variations of his. Ed-
wards was waiting for this with a cold eye, and as
Janies leaped the Englishman’s left hooked him fair
in the pit of the stomach and the right followed with
terrible force to the ribs. Ilill went down like a
log. Someone said it was “a beautiful punch.”
Fred Enck, 9st. 2ilb., a newcomer from
the land of Windy Wilson, supplied a certain amount
of entertainment at Melbourne Stadium last Satur-
day night with Bert Spargo (Bst. 131 b.) as opposi-
tion. For 15 rounds Enck smiled, sniffed, spat,
poked out his tongue, made the best use of a
shifty top piece, and supplied a little variety by
ducking and lifting Spargo bodily off the floor.
Enck did all these things while Spargo banged him
about with both hands, until referee Quirk stopped
the encounter and declared that Spargo had banged
enough. There was really no damage done. Only
a tremendous amount of misdirected energy sup-
plied by both parties. Enck was obviously above
condition, and if Spargo had scientifically placed
the energy of 15 rounds into (say) half that
period the contest would have ended in precisely
the same way. Enck is a well-built youngster with
exceptionally strong legs, a well-moulded body and
a general make-up, on pocket edition lines, closely,
resembling that of ex-middleweight Eddie Williams,' 1
who engaged Arthur Cripps on several occasions.
There was meat enough in Saturday’s
scrap between Owen Cairns and Ferdnand Quendreux
to satisfy any cannibal in Brisbane. Both pugs were
obsessed with the idea of sending the other home in
an ice-cart. France went nearest to having the
pleasure, handing Australia a wallop or two in the
17th round that removed its smile and made it feel
cool around the ankles. But Owen came back with
more grin and knocks. He mostly got the verdict for
his grin.
W. CARKEEK , Victoria.
The Victorian featherweight Spargo feels
annoyed that as Jimmy Hill is leaving that division
the title of champion is not handed on to him.
Also, he objects to Sid Godfrey, of Sydney, being
ranked as Hill’s successor. There is a lot more
force in the latter objection than in the first. This
championship business is talked about in an absurdly
loose way. What is it, anyhow? To hear some
people it might be imagined that the thing was
something like a pound of chops or any other com-
modity to be handed round as a memento of the
occasion. In point of fact, it is more or less of an
advertising monopoly held temporarily by an indivi-
dual with a punch and ability to draw a gate. On
general principles Godfrey has no more claim to be
considered a champion than a statesman. Nor, for
that matter, has Spargo—at any rate, on his show-
ing in Sydney. Yet if either can wallop the other he
can call himself champion without being contradicted
so long as he can stop anyone else who comes along
looking for fight. But championships are elusive
things. If anybody wants to test the actual value
of one, let him take it round to the Mont-de-Pi£te
and try to get an advance of 2d. on it.

When Darcy scooted it looked as if the
big draw in N’Yark would be a match between him
and Dillon ; but now there is reason to suspect that
John has struck the slide, and Darcy need not bother
about him. Anyhow, following on news that Dillon
had been badly outpointed by Mike Gibbons, word
cornes that Billy Miske maltreated him in the same
way. Miske has been punching his way into the
limelight for some months, and seems to have now
got right there.

“The Hum”: In judging a long-distance
walk, or any other endurance test, conditions and
circumstances have to be considered. That’s why I
think this is a good one. George Pardon, of
Wodonga (Vic.), when near the half-century and
with a waist-band of as many inches, acquired
through the easy life of a country pub-keeper, walked
from Wodonga to Wangaratta, miles of rough
country road, in 10 hours. In response to a challenge
at a later date he did the same journey in 15 hours,
drawing a 12st. man in a, sulky. The wager was
made at 1 a.m., after a strenuous day round town
and a convivial evening. The most surprised man in
Wodonga at 7.30 that morning was the other party
to the wager, when George roused him up to take the
time of the start and send along his umpire. The
only gear used was an ordinary clothes-line, tied to
the shafts and looped over the shoulders. Pardon
was 53 years of age when the war started. He found
it no trouble to lose 10 of these, but had to come up
three times before his bingy squeezed past.
! Itichmond (Vic.) puts forward a juvenile
champion against the claims of the Manly and Bondi
mermaids in athletic little Marjorie Bennett, aged
five, daughter of the superintendent of the local
baths. Used to the water since babyhood, she has
secured the junior swimming certificate of the Edu-
cation Department, and can float, take a “.Tack
Johnson” into the water, dive from the springboard
and accomplish a creditable trudgeon stroke; and
she recently carried Harry Witty, the 131st. secre-
tary of the Royal Life Saving Society, 10 yards
through the water.
“U.S.” : Ruth Law has flown from Chicago
to New York—a thousand miles by rail and 900 by
wing. She made one hundred miles an hour, thus
beating the express by three hours. She is ambitious
to fly from the Atlantic to the Pacific in three
swoops. Aloft she wears silk, chamois skin over
that, then wool, and lastly a thick fur-lined coat
and leather breeches.
* * * ♦
Ned Triekett, the lately-dead sculler
who first brought the world’s championship to Aus-
tralia, is to have a memorial on the Parramatta,
unless a scheme now in hand miscarries.
“Tackle” : This. goes up for my record
trout. Hooked in the Selwyn, Canterbury (M.L.),
he taped 28in. longways and 20in. around, and if
you'd eaten all of him you’d have been 1311 b. to the
good.
“Madge S.”: A rock-cod was recently
hooked at Gladstone (Q.), which was 6ft. 6in. long
and sft. lOin. in circumference. Scale, 4501 b.
Anyhow, that’s Gladstone’s version.
Wicketkeeper A. D. Ratcliffe (Balmain),
operating against Glebe in the just-concluded premier-
ship round, stumped two-and caught one, and in the
first innings only allowed one bye in 118. Also with
the bat he. smote 85 not out. In the holiday match
last week, Ratcliffe scored 39, and prevented old
Sundries scoring more than 10 in a total of 213.
Carter’s dropping out of the bigger State matches
leaves Ratcliffe with a claim to be considered the
smartest Jack-in-the-box in Sydney cricket.
Alan Kippax (Waverley), who made 120
not out against Sydney on Saturday, was one of the
State’s topnotch schoolboys a couple of years ago.
Last season he scored 497 at an average of 38.23 in
premiership matches, the best effort being 112
against Petersham. This season his batting suffered
through over-exertion while pitching with Waverley
in winter baseball. This recent cricket effort looks
like a restoration of confidence.
* -X- * *
Tom Andrews, of Petersham (Sydney),
owes the Kaiser a grudge. But for the war he
would have been a competitor for the position of
cricket idol. As things are now, cricket idols are two
a penny. Playing for Gregory’s side in the Anni-
versary Day match on Sydney Cricket Ground
Andrews made 102 (run out), and next day amassed
107 for Petersham against Newcastle. The rest of
Petersham scored 23 and Sundries 12. Andrews is
a first-class change bowler, too.
* * * *
“First Slip”: My entry for a running-
between-wickets competition—A. C. and F. Kenny,
of South Melbourne. 1 have seen some of the masters
of this important but too-oft-neglected art in cricket,
including the famous opening partners Trumper and
Duff, Clem Hill, Harry Graham and Syd Gregory;
but nothing they did was more delightful to watch
than the fast, clever running between sticks of these
diminutive twins. Their judgment would defy even
the throw-out returns of a Hohbs from cover-point or
the out-fielding of a Ransford. The only displeased
onlooker at a Kenny partnership is the slow scorer.
He can't tell which Kenny to give the runs to.
* * * *
The indiscriminate yeller of “Yah, cold-
footer!” is still abroad in the land —very much
abroad sometimes. One of him tackled the Vic-
torian Rowing Ass. the other day, suggesting that
the oarsmen who raced on the Yarra on the 13th
ult. ought to be fit to go to the Front. V.R.A.
secretary Kenny promptly obliged with the figures:
1016 members out of 2117 had enlisted up to Octo-
ber 1 last, with a large number of the balance
rejected, and most of the rest ineligible through
extreme whiskers or family responsibilities. Of the
1016 who had enlisted up to that date 84 will not
come back- and 18 have won military honors. The
actual competitors in the recent Yarra contests were
mostly over-age, under-age, rejects or A.I.F. men,
with one returned soldier. It is unpleasant to be
called a cold-footer, but the V.R.A. hasn’t much
cause to worry.

Killed in France, Keith Eltham. one of
the Speck’s first-line cricketers and one of the best
of the few local baseballers. He was in the Field
Artillery, and got away by the first troopship that
left Hobart, was wounded on Gallipoli and again
in France, and then went back to meet the end.
He had worked up to lieutenant.

Why Look Old ?
You need not use hair dye to conceal grey hair.
Grey hair adds years to anyone’s appear-
ance. The objections to dyeing the hair are
too numerous and too obvious to mention.
Few people are aware that a simple, old-
fashioned recipe, that can be made up at
home, will quickly turn grey hair back to a
natural color without injuring the hair in
any way. One has only to get two ounces
of concentrate of taminalite from the chemist
and mix it with three ounces of hay rum.
With a small sponge apply the lotion" to the
hair for a few nights and the desired change
will have been neatly accomplished. This
simple formula has given great satisfac-
tion for generations to those i.n possession of
it.— Advt. [3

Paris and London both are now tripping to work

It is a smart little boot, there is no doubt

never imagined they could wear a short-fronted

The T., E. & A. has had at least one stroke
of good luck during the past half-year. The co.
was at the beginning of things required to
put up £lO,OOO with the Government as a
guarantee of good behavior, and in return
the Government issued inscribed stock at
par. Nobody, however, guaranteed the Gov-
ernment; and gradually the market value
of the stock shrank, until recently it stood
at 62. At this stage the co. decided that
it was about time to establish a serious fund
to protect this and other securities. Also
the Government was argued with and at
last it was persuaded that, since these cos.
had been compelled to part up this money
and take stock in exchange, they were en-
titled to and must get 20s. in the £ “when
the time arrives for the redemption of the
stock.’’ That makes this compulsory invest-
ment quite different; wherefore instead of
appearing as “Inscribed stock at par held
by the Treasurer of Victoria” it is now
“Guarantee fund held by the Treasurer of
Victoria.” 'This change takes some of the
burden off the investments fluctuation fund
(£7000). Still there is work for it to do,
even if only to safeguard the formal reserve
fund (£50,000), which is invested in mort-
gage loans and public securities.
The value of the trusts in hand is
£11.702,201 ; and that shows steady improve-
ment. At the end of 1010 the total was
£8,923.134. Twenty years ago it was
£6,140,068; so the accumulation has been
much more rapid of late than in former
years. The profit shown in any one term
is necessarily only an estimate, because an
arbitrary proportion of the corpus commis-
sion is set aside for future expenses. But
the average for the past four terms ought
to give a fairly true figure. Deduct the
income from investments, and it will be
found that the balance of the annual profit
for the past two years equals Is. 3d. per
£lOO of the value of the estates in hand.
And no doubt some long-term trusts yield
still less profit to the co. Or, to put it from
the clients’ point of view, the co. makes as
an average only Is. 3d. per cent, out of the
trust estates, and much less than that out
of a trust which takes, say, 20 years to wind
up.
The point on which the T.. E. & A. differs
from most other cos. in this class is in regard
to the amount of its capital. Shareholders
have put up £90,000; and, in addition, there
is nearly £60,000 of reserves to further pro-
tect the client. Alongside these sums the
£lO,OOO which the law requires as a guaran-
tee fund is hardly worth mentioning. As a
matter of fact, nearly all these guarantees
serve but one, good purpose: they merely
keep the adventurer who is without resources
from taking risks which he could not stand
up to if luck went against him. If the bonds
were intended to have a permanent value
they ought to be increased as the risk in-
creased. Here, for instance, is a co. with
nearly 12 million pounds of trust funds in its
custody. Other cos. with risks incidental to
the handling of only a couple of millions
have also to put up £lO.OOO. No matter
what the risk the bond is thus the same.
This is absurd. Even a police-court magis-
trate could tell the Government that. The
bond ought to he proportioned to the trust
estates in hand : or, at any rate, the funds
of the co. should be. The law should, in
short, require a co. to do what this excellent
co. has done voluntarily.

The capital is £5750 preference and £24,500
ordinary; and in all their days the ordinaries
have had only one small bite, and that was
10 years ago. This has been like most other
ventures depending upon amusement novel-
ties. After being open for only 16 weeks,
the Glaciarium showed a net profit of £3289,
and that gave the 5 p.c. div. shown above.
For the whole of the next year the profit
was only £702. By that time the directors
began to have a suspicion that there was
more money in cold storage for mutton than
in an ice-skating floor for lambs; and that
meant further heavy expenditure and the
issue of pref. shares. But the finances have
never been satisfactory, and have not been
getting any better. During the past year
an attempt to sell some more pref. shares
failed ; and apparently the point is approach-
ing when something must be done. On Sep-
tember 30 the liabilities totalled £16,265,
including an overdraft of £2878; and the
assets, apart from premises, working plant
and “shares in other cos. at cost,” were
valued at £2312. Altogether the history of
the co. after the first few months has been
one long inky smudge. Yet the record of the
Sydney co. that most nearly corresponds
has been almost brilliant, which gives hope
that some day this co. may do well too.

She Darkened Her Grey Hair
A Society Lady Darkened Her Grey Hair
and Stimulated Its Growth by a
Simple Home Process.
She Tells How She Did It.
A well-known society lady, who darkened
her grey hair by a simple home process,
made the following statement: “Any lady
or gentleman can darken their grey or faded
hair, stimulate its growth and make it soft
and glossy with this simple recipe, which
they can mix at home. To a half-pint of water
add loz. of bay rum and 1 small box of
Orlex Compound. These ingredients can
be purchased at any chemist’s at very, little
cost. Apply to the hair every other day
until the grey hair is darkened sufficiently.
This mixture relieves itching and is excel-
lent for dandruff. It does not stain the
scalp, is not sticky or greasy and does not
rub: off. It will make a grey-haired person
look 10 to 20 years vonnyor.” —Auvt IP,
GOITRE

after using the treatment I am happy
to say it has been reduced four inches.”

dreds more may be seen on application.

Explaining “Feminine Charm”
By MILLICENT BROWN.
.Illustrated by PENRHYN STANLAWS.
1 NOTICED a curious thing recently in
a railway train. A nicely-dressed
woman entered, and took a seat beside
me. I saw that everyone was looking at
her—staring, in fact. But
not offensively, you under-
stand. I caught my-
self doing the same
thing. It was
impossible to
help it. Cer-
tainly it was
not her
said ; “I remove my skin.” “You whatf” I
exclaimed, horrified. Again she laughed, and
replied, “Sounds shocking, doesn't it V But
I will explain. Instead of using face creams
I use only pure mercolized
wax, procurable at any
chemist’s. The wax
has a gentle absorbent
action which

there was
something about her

I risked it, and spoke.
“Would you mind telling
me,” I said, “how you keep
your complexion so dazzlingly pure? You
won’t think me impertinent, but you seem
to be over thirty, aren’t you? And yet you
haven’t a line in your face, and your cheeks
are quite peach-like. Do tell me how
you do it.” She laughed, quite good-
naturedly. “Oh, that’s very easy,” she

Every woman has a beauti-
ful complexion underneath,
you know. Then, to keep
my face firm and free from wrinkles, I
merely indulge in a sparkling face bath two
or three times a week, which I prepare by
dissolving a little stymol (obtained at the
chemist’s) in a bowl of warm water. This
also keeps away those unpleasant little
blackheads, and prevents ‘shine.’ ” [3

The Ingathering of the Israelites of the
House of David, a concern headquartered in
the U.R. and running an amusement-park
there as one of its main lines, has estab-
lished agencies in Australia; and, as a
result, the local Christian Israelite is receiv-
ing more than the usual notice from the
public. The chief difference between the
two bodies (apart from matters of finance)
seems to be that Christian Israelites wear
the hair in a “bun,” while the David kind
allows his tresses to go wild. Thickly-
populated .Fitzroy, where so many exclusive
little sects do a thriving business among
the more prosperous illiterate, is the home
suburb of the “bun”-wearers in Victoria.
In one of the main business streets they
have a “sanctuary,” of which the first brick
was laid more than half a century ago. and
their clerk is an ancient establishment called
Shadraeh Hertel, who these many years
has conducted a woodyard and grocery a
few yards down the block. Tithes from
the income of the hairy ones are supposed
to be sent to the management of the “bun”-
brotlierhood in England, though a 10 per
cent, contribution from every member seems
a considerable whack for the privilege of
employing an unfashionable style of hair-
dressing. The Christian bunch is modest
compared with the crowd in the U.S., how-
ever. They take the lot and won’t admit
Australians to membership until it is all
paid over.

It is a business truth that when
distributing articles in universal use
the demand is for the article of
lower price.
But tyre buyers throughout Aus-
tralia are, for very good reasons,
more than ever breaking this gener-
ally-accepted custom, by exhibiting
a great and growing preference for
Goodyear, though these are not the
tyres of lower price.
Immediately motorists began to
experience, and so appreciate, the
superiority of Goodyear Tyres (and
Tubes) over all others, the real
demand for Goodyears began and
has been growing ever since.
Motorists are among; the keenest
of buyers, and have realised that to
let a small extra first cost stand in
the way of getting service, safety and
the greatest possible mileage is not
tvre economy.
j j
They gladly pay a little more for
Goodyear Tyres because they know
that the extra value is there.
The Goodyear Tyre of every size,
fitting and pattern contains better
material, is of better construction,
and gives greater mileage and more
service than any other tyre at the
same price, and than many other
tyres at a higher price.
Owners and drivers
have one and all
learned that a lower
price will not compen-
sate a motorist for
poor results in tyes.

—freedom
from Dust!
YOUR house can never
be hygienically clean
until it is free from dust.
But continual dusting and
cleaning and getting down
on your hands and knees,
has been hard, back-break-
ing work.
This labour will continue
until you get an
Qgdar^Jop
Polish
[Registered in principal countries]
Then the hard work ceases. But cleaning
and dusting is not all the O-Cedar Polish-
Mop does: it polishes at the same time —puts
a hard, durable, lasting lustre to all varnished
and finished surfaces. Besides, you use the
same mop to dust and clean the tops of doors,
and all high furniture, standing woodwork and
beamed ceilings.
The O-Cedar Polish-Mop is made from
long fibre, soft cotton and treated with
the world-famous O-Cedar Polish. It
is cleaned by washing and then re-
newed with a few drops of O-Cedar
Polish. It is heavily padded to prevent
marring or scratching the furniture.
The handle is 54 inches long, making
it easy to clean those hard-to-get-at
places. There are more than two
million O-Cedar Polish-Mops in every-
day use in all parts of the world.

IN
BANANA LAND
“L.S.”: The Clermont deluge, which
destroyed ' the court-house, swamped the
papers connected with Queensland’s most
sensational murder. T. .T. Griffin was Gold
Commissioner at Clermont in the early ’6o's,
and he got himself into financial difficulties
through gambling. In Nov., 1867, he set
out with the gold escort, consisting of J.
Power and William Cahill. Later, when
these two men were found murdered and
robbed of a considerable sum, the police
said nothing, but sniffed in Griffin’s direc-
tion. Soon they got some good evidence,
whereupon lie was arrested, tried before
Justice Lutwyclie at Rockhampton, sen-
tenced to death, and hanged on June 1,
1868.
Back in Australia, Captain Lindsay
Browne, who fought in France with the
Royal Irish Rifles in 1914 and was in the
first list of recipients of the Military Cross.
At Neuve Chapelle, in October, 1914, he
was the only unwounded officer of his bat-
talion, and was 14 days on watch in the
trenches, breaking the monotony by taking-
part in 27 bayonet charges. Just as he was
relieved his nerves gave way under shell
shock, and he has not recovered yet. He is
an old boy of Rockhampton Grammar. His
father was a cousin of Rolf Boldrewood.
Passed out at Rockhampton, S. J. Wills,
one of Bananaland’s best-known vets. After
doing time in London and Edinburgh uni-
versities, he hit this land in ’B6, and subse-
quently ran salt-works and a sawmill at
Gladstone in company with Colonel McKen-
zie, of Auburn station, and A. C. F. Camp-
bell-Praed (husband of the authoress), of
Monte Cristo, Curtis Island. For the next
24 years Wills schooled the young idea of
Westwood, finally retiring from the Educa-
tion Department in 1903. His family of
eight are nearly all in the Government ser-
vice.
Died in France, Private J. W. Vance, one
of the first to be prosecuted for failing to
attend drill under the home-service (cadet)
law. But when the chance came to him to
be something more than a Saturday-after-
noon soldier he didn’t need any ordering,
and was into the scrap from the jump.
A far-seeing man was Charles Hardie
Buzacott, the pioneer journalist of the Peak
Downs. After the big 1870 flood had swept
through Clermont he called a meeting and
suggested that the town be shifted to a
higher site. The suggestion was turned
down almost unanimously. Only 15 persons
had been drowned on that occasion, and of
course it wasn’t going to occur again. With
another 60 corpses to its debit Clermont has
now changed its mind.
“Hopbooze”: No one questions McCaw-
ley’s ability as Crown Solicitor at £BOO a
year, but his claims to a judgeship at £2OOO
are so obscure that even the Ryan Govern-
ment hasn’t indicated them. A barrister as
peerless as “Shay” hints (B. 18/1/T7) that
McCawley is would have been earning
double his present salary of £2OOO three
years ago. Regarding the sectarian uproar,
take one instance as justifying it: in the
new State Insurance Department 17 out of
a staff of 19 belong to Fihelly’s religion. Of
course, it may be only a coincidence; but
such coincidences have become so plentiful
that it doesn't require a Yellow Pup to smell
them out.
“EVERY DESCRIPTION OF GOODS KEPT.”
“If you please , I want a pair of trousers for my husband. He takes about the same size
as what you might; but he’s very long in the body and short in the legs; and I
don’t want 'em to turn up too much, you know; and he’s a dreadful fellow for spill-
ing his tea on his lap, so I want some color that won’t show the stains.”
Cooktown, once the second port in Queens-
land, is almost a shell now. There is so
little kernel left that the Customs House has
just been closed.
Dirt money has become so big a question
in Bananaland that Dean, P.M., recently
received a commission to inquire into and
report on the matter. Dirt money originated
in Glasgie, where men on filthy work in
old ships’ holds received id. an hour more
than their comrades employed at clean work
on new 7 vessels. In Queensland dirt money
has been costing the State at the rate of
£19,000 per annum, “with a tendency to
increase without limit.” Already it has got
this far —a railway employee recently told
the Minister that a mail could draw dirt
money and yet keep a starched shirt imma-
culate all day.
Bananaland Laborites lost an almost his-
toric supporter when Mrs. Emma Miller
passed out a few days ago. The old lady
had been identified with the Northern Labor
movement for 25 years, and was always a
conspicuous figure at elections and Labor
upheavals. Her creed was beautifully simple
—Socialism always right; anything else
always wrong. Keen, wiry, alert, she kept
her nose to the trail of Tory iniquities, and
the way the little woman headed the big
tramway strike procession some few years
ago was a sight not to be forgotten. Queens-
land Labor has no champion in petticoats
to replace her.
“Eta” : Clermont started with a gold rush.
11. 11. Tawse, who w 7 as there on Jan. 14,
1862, has left it on record that the Peak
Downs goldfield was discovered by four
drovers, Nelson, McDonald, Cameron and
“Jack,” employed by Manning, Goggs and
Hood to take stock to start a run at Lang-
ton, eight miles from where Clermont now
stands. While building a hut they discovered
payable gold in what is now called Nelson’s
Gully. That was in the middle of 1861.
When they had finished their work they took
50oz. of gold to Rockhampton. Then they
bought a turnout and went back. Tawse
and his mate (C. M. Christie) arrived on
Jan. 14, 1802, having gone from Sydney
immediately the news of the find leaked
through. D. Downs, who afterwards claimed
to have discovered the field, only arrived in
Rockhampton at the end of ’62 and went to
Clermont in ’63. He and his mates did,
however, discover what was called Hurlie’s
rush.
The Brisbane P.M. went in search of fur-
ther information the other day and got it: —
The P.M.: Does her husband allow her anything?
Plaintiff: No.
The P.M.: Is he working?
Plaintiff: No.
The P.M.: Where is he at present ?
The Plaintiff: In the cemetery !
“Come Along, Old Son.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We loafed one hot day back o’ Somewhere
In France, after drubbin’ the foe.
When up come a Billjim in khaki
With someone a-trampin' in tow;
The someone was plainly a Fritzie,
A squarehead all muddy an’ grey,
An' Billjim an’ he were quite chummy
An’ seemed to have plenty to say.
We stopped ’em a moment to word ’em,
Our time fer a spell nearly done.
’Twas “Bill, don’t you dink it vas beer-time?”
An’ “Fritz, come along, old son !”
Said Billjim : “1 came across Fritzie,
His comrades were scattered or dead,
Last Monday ’way down in the trenches—•
We fought an’ we fought till we bled.
He wounded me here in the shoulder,
I wounded him there in the thigh,
An’ then it was “Kamerad, Kamerad !”
An’ boss of a Deutscher was I.
A funny old cove is old Fritzie,
A thirster, if ever was one.
It’s “Bill, don’t you dink it vas beer-time?”
An’ “Fritz, come along, old son !”
An’ Billjim the lean an’ the lanky
Strolled off to the rear with his prize,
Who gazed on him lovin’ and doglike,
With worship a-shine in his eyes;
We laughed as they cheerily left us
An’ wondered an’ wondered no end
How a man could go kill in the morn in’
An’ shake the next day as a friend.
You’d almost ha’ thought they was brothers,
Our khaki boy towin’ his Hun.
With “Bill, don’t you dink it vas beer-time?”
Ail’ “Fritz, come along, old son !”

Brisbane, January 29, 1917.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Governor Goold-Adams is forced to get
work again. During the week he will pro-
trude an attentive ear while Dudley Le
Souef, Director of Melbourne Zoo, makes
some remarks concerning birds, snakes and
other animals. On Saturday his Ex. is
billed to lay the foundation-stone of a new
city hall, a performance that has been
threatening for a century or so.
And that reminds me that our most ancient
City Father has been re-elected to the Coun-
cil unopposed. With 40 years of alder-
manic activities in his wake, John McMaster
appears to be qualifying for a world's
record. He still carries the same brolly
and waves the identical whiskers that David
Low so delightfully cartooned for us a few
years since. *
“Triangle Day,” on Friday, on behalf of
that good friend of Billjim the Y.M.C.A.,
caught us in the right mood and, when we
had counted the takings we were £lOOO out
of pocket.
Bobbie Burns’s memory was brought out
and dusted on the anniversary of his birth
last week. As you remember, Thargomindah,
he was one of the few Scotsmen who haven’t
stuck to their job. When Annie Elliott
warbled “Whustle and I’ll come tae ye,”
every mon in the hall, especially the auld
yins, whustled an’ stampit maist recklessly.
The town has been invaded from north,
south, west and further west by school
teachers. The usual conference was mainly
taken up with the growl that knows no rest
concerning mean pay. Minister for Educa-
tion ITardcastle temporarily smoothed the
ruffled brows on Thursday at a river trip
on the Lucinda. He had as supports the
Premier and Mrs. Ityan, the Treasurer and
Mrs. Theodore and a few other heads. But
soft soap has had its innings and the
Squeerses are set upon taking their griev-
ances to the Arbitration Court.
Will one wedding suffice this week? Well,
Emily Hayman, of Indooroopilly, and one
of our most faithful Red Cross workers, has
murmured the good word to Dr. Stanley
Roe, son of the Director of Education.
Mrs. Ralph Clifton is visiting Sydney.
News of the marriage of her son to Ida
Boyd, a former Brisbane pen-girl, came
through JO days ago. The words were said
in London. Ralph, jun., is now back in
the trenches.
The Harveys of Rundaberg are doing
their bit. Arch holds a commission with
the 14th Battalion and is convalescing in
Scotland. George is a driver with the 14th
Field Ambulance. Arthur was a corporal in

“Hamer”: A par. (B. 11/1/’l7) mentions
four plays—“ East Lynne,” “Silver King,”
“Struck Oil” and “Our Boys”—as “always
sure of an audience because of their appeal
to our common humanity.” There are others
in the class, although the “appeal” of some
of them has a doubtful basis. When Dam-
pier found that houses were failing he could
always make a catch-up with “Robbery
Under Arms.” Hawtrey found “The Mes-
sage from Mars” infallible. “Charley’s
Aunt” saved Thornton in emergencies, and
Arnold discovered that “Hans the Boatman”
was a sheet anchor. “Fun on the Bristol”'
many a time saved Johnny Sheridan and
others, including the Cosgroves. The latter
had picked up a lease of the Cyclorama,
Adelaide, and with it a stranded Italian
opera company. An attempt to change the
bill nightly led to disaster, and after the
strangers had declined to attempt impossi-
bilities, the Cosgroves told them to fly the
garter, and in place of opera put up “Fun
on the Bristol.” It saved a desperate situa-
tion. Dan Barry used to find a farcical
melodrama called “The Irish Detective” an
effective help; while “The Sign of the
Cross” was the life-line of a more recent
show. My final instance always delights me
most. The sons of the old Majeronis ven-
tured on Brisbane with the classical plays
of their parents and met frosty business: but
a hasty dash with “The Kelly Gang” drew
packed houses.
From London comes a rumor that George
Reid has been appealed to by an enterprising
American manager to take part in some very
elaborate picture play he is preparing—a
play “of world-wide interest.” It sounds
preposterous, but ever since the death of
John Bunny there has been an urgent de-
mand for a picture favorite possessing just
those physical attributes the world appreci-
ates most in George Reid. If an army
travels on its stomach, why may not an ex-
Pie Commissioner?
“Jwosp”: I smile when it is announced
that J. and N. Tait are bringing out the
original cast for G. V. Hobart’s “Experi-
ence.” That little morality play—another
“Everywoman,” but different —had a cast of
65 in U.S.A., and that’s a tall order even
for such a whole-hog importer as the Aus-
tralian manager. Hobart, who, by the way,
is nearly a millionaire as a result of satisfy-
ing Yankee playgoers, is doing a new
morality extravaganza, entitled “Happi-
ness.”
“M.P.A.”: Some 16 years ago Clive
O’Hara, Clifford Eskell, “Doc” Rowe,
Claude Guest, Harold Nathan, “Herman”
and several other youngsters were budding
conjurers in Melbourne. Amongst the
“great magicians” whose acts were keenly
discussed the name of Horace Goldin came
first. Goldin to us was a demi-god. As the
years rolled by Powell, Allan Sliaw, Bertram
Harcourt, Clarke (Maskleyne and Devant).
Howard Thurston, Carlton, Talma Leroy
and Bosco, Stillwell, Chung Ling Soo,
Carter, Janson, Iloudini and de Beere came
and went. Meantime Clive O’Hara became
Henry Clive (“the talking magician”),
Claude Guest was changed to Wong Toy
Sun, and Dr. Rowe and Alberto, retaining
their names, went afield, while the others
faded out. Clifford Eskell, the cleanest and
most dexterous of us all. eventually returned
and let the art slide. Then, after waiting
years, I saw the great Goldin, lie looked
more like a sawu-off wrestler than a magi-
cian and put on his act as if he didn’t
care whether the public “jerried” or not.
He did the “egg bag” and “knotted hand-
kerchiefs” well, and got more out of these
two simple stunts than out of his tons of
gear. Taken all round, he amounted to the
biggest disappointment ever presented here.
I’d like to have heard what the old Goldin
worshippers thought. Clifford Eskell, by
the way, was really responsible for the con-
juring-review that Goldin introduced to Aus-
tralia. Eskell’s idea was to impersonate all
the big dead-and-goue magicians in their
greatest acts, each impersonation to have- a
special and appropriate setting. He wrote
Goldin about the scheme, and Goldin replied
asking what Eskell was prepared to do.
Eskell let the matter slide, whereupon
Goldin adopted the turn, but only in part,
and that he simply slung on.
The weather is pretty sultry when a
manager puts the comfort of his patrons
before their money, yet that is happening in
Sydney at Wirths’ Hippodrome. “Owing
to the heat,” the announcement runs, “no
gallery tickets will be sold.”
“S.S.”: I heard a very old actor give a
very young one an encouraging word the
other night after the show. "My dear boy.”
he said, "if you persist you will make an
excellent actress.”
THE LEADING LADY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Among the leading American film actresses who
earn over 300 dollars a week, Miss Betty Boon is
conspicuous. Betty is the cleverest of the big apes
working for the movies. In many places her comedy
is as popular as that of Charlie Chaplin. She courts
notoriety with all the devices familiar to expensive
picture artistes. —Stage paper.
From rural parts the lady came,
With neither band nor banner ;
No .fervid agent breathed her name,
In no ecstatic manner
Did wild reporters tell her tale;
She was a simple creature.
But now her photos, are for sale,
And she’s a special feature.
Although her face is plain no scribe '
Her beauty will disparage;
She is the first of all her tribe
To own a motor-carriage;
She has a dresser, so they say,
A maid to do her collars ;
At her hotel the cost per day
Is close on seven dollars.
She has the best ice-creams to eat
Of ten assorted flavors,
And thirty managers compete ~
To gain Miss Betty’s favors.
When walking out her health to seek
She's tended by a flunky;
And three*and-sixty quid a week
She’s paid to ape the monkey.

Within the Law
All traffic laws, rules and regulations are becoming
more rigid every day.
This is as it should be. Safety first.
All the more reason for having the best speedometer
on your car the Stewart Speedometer.
Without one you unconsciously break the law,
because no motorist can possibly estimate the speed of his
car without a speedometer.
Unless you do drive at a speed within the law, you
are liable to the embarrassment of arrest, the humiliation
of a trial and the possibility of a heavy fine.-
Do not smile. It might happen to you any day, as
it has to thousands of others.
This magnetic speedometer is especially built for
Ford and other small-type cars.
Price only £3/10/- complete.
Priced low on account of our great production.
Why not get one and keep within the law?
Stewart products on a car are your safest
guide as to the quality of a car as a whole.
Most cars are so equipped. In selecting your
next car try to have it equipped with a Stewart
Tyre Pump, Stewart Warning Signals, Stewart
Vacuum System and Stewart Speedometer.
It will cost you nothing more.

Taking the hill on “top”
The last pinch of the hill doesn’t matter if
you are using the right spirit. Don’t rack
your gears and race your engine by chang-
ing down. Do the whole climb on top.
You must use “Plume” before you will
appreciate its wonderful qualities. More
mileage, easier starting, cleaner cylinders.
Plume Benzine
Easy starling—Sweet running—More miles
Under analysis this spirit shows definite
reasons for the production of greater energy
in explosions. Practical demonstration
counts more than theory and practical proof
is to be found in every tin of “ Plume.”
Correct Lubrication
The lubrication of your gear box and
differential is a matter needing great care.

The Inky Way.
“J.K.” : The weekly press has been at it
again. In the middle of the recent heat
wave it tried to tell a perspiring city that it
was too hot for ordinary mortals. Rut the
lino, knew better, and merely declared it too
hot for ordinary morals.
“Sesquipedalian”: One of the most con-
cise headings I remember was put up by
tbe Argus some years ago over a suicide
who had tied his arms and thrown himself
into the river. The caption, which told the
story in three words, was “Bound and
Drowned.” There was a good sample of the
epigrammatic in Sydney Sun. The Tenth
Battalion had been in camp in drenching
weather, and over a column of hot air and
water the sub. erected the brief masterpiece:
“The Submerged Tenth.” “Frau Gamp” is
a recent Melbourne Herald headline on a
cable that announces the establishment of
a Berlin bureau for war babies. An echo of
a Bulletin joke is heard in another of the
Herald’s headlines, over an item dealing
with the row between the Berlin burgo-
master and Batocki, the food dictator.
Here’s how the Herald puts it up: “The
Food Feud: Burgomaster on One Side —
Burgoo-master on the Other.” Many a good
headline is lost owing to a sub editor being
afraid of an accusation of frivolity. Of this
class was Harry Gullett’s suggestion to an
Argus sub. when a suburban baker had cut
his wife’s throat. The sub. knew that editor
Cunningham would never stand Harry’s
happy thought. It was “Butchery in a
Bakery.” In this connection, what is the
most brilliant heading, in the experience of
Inky Wayfarers, ever put up and actually
printed in a paper of standing?
Thomas Tucker, professor of Classical
Philology at Melbourne University, is usu-
ally credited with the “literary” leading-
article which every few Saturdays is pub-
lished in the Argus. The latest effort of
Tucker or his ghost dealt with the scarcity
of paper and the need for more compact
and careful writing. “Newspapers and
bdoks,” it was urged, “are full of statements
that could be as well said in a fraction of
the space.... Brevity and eloquence march
hand in hand. . . .Economy is the watchword
to-day. Why not try to save a few super-
fluous words, a handful of redundant
phrases? They will never be missed.” Good
advice —and only a trifle over a column of
it!
* * * #
“Wenona” : Even if I never win Tatter-
sail’s sweep I’ve one claim to fame. I went
to school with a “Daughter of the Gods.”
’Way back in the years ago Annette Keller-
man and I chewed the ends of our pen-
holders in the same class at a school on the
fringe of Dulwich Hill (Sydney). The prin-
cipal looked upon dancing as the second
step to Eternal Warmth, and it is
an ironical circumstance that Annette was
the only one of her pupils to achieve
four figures in the movies! In those
days Annette was a dreamy flapper
with dark curls parted on either side of an
oval face decorated with a richly-curved
mouth. She had literary ambitions, and we
used to suck our pencils and concoct marvel-
lous stories of school life when we should
have been wrestling with the Tudors. There
was a school magazine of which Annette
was the whole editorial staff. It wilted
under the sun of adverse criticism. But her
evergreen supplies of new button boots were
the envy and wrath of us all. She was
easily head of the school in shapeliness of
understandings.
“Montalex”: Perhaps Mudford was wise
<B. IS/1/T7) in shutting himself off from
the world. No editor can be quite as mag-
nificent as his editorials. I had proof of
that in India. Soon after joining the staff
of a big paper I had a disagreement with
the sub., and told him I’d see the editor.
“If you do, you’ll be clever,” he said. “I’ve
been here six years, and I've never seen
him.” I thought this was bluff, and promptly
made inquiries. "Editahr’s offas not' in
thees beelding, sahib,” said the turbaned
seneschal. “Bettar see the manjing direc-
tahr.” A bland and portly Bengali gentle-
man received me politely. “If you will
favor me with your business, I represent the
editor in the meantime,” he said. I “favored,”
and he bowed me out. "You will hear of
this matter in the course of the afternoon.”
he said, and I did. I found out afterwards
that the “manjing directahr” —a Cambridge
M.A. —was himself the editor, but it wasn’t
thought advisable to let it be known that a
Bengali filled the chair.

REXONA for Surfers

■
Miss BERYL
FERGUSON
(from a photo.
Monte Luke).
Beautiful Miss Beryl Ferguson came before
the public with the Blanche Browne “Our Miss
Gibbs” Co., of gaiety and charm. She was
brought into even greater prominence in her
recent dance with Mr. Paul Plunkett in “The
Girl in the Taxi,” and is a favorite with every-
one. Miss Ferguson joins the Rexona girls
with the following words
“I want you to know that I am a Rexona
Surfing Girl; I simply love surfing, and am
so fond of it that I often go in when the
sun is strongest, but I never have any bad
effects from surfing, for I always use
Rexona before going in. I rub some on
my face and hands, and I never get sun-
burnt nor my skin affected in any way.
After my surf is over I always have a cake
of Rexona Soap which I use in the shower
on my hair and skin, and I find
by the use of Rexona and Rexona
Soap any girl can keep herself
quite as fresh and dainty when
surfing as she could by missing
all this fun and always thinking
of her complexion.
“Amongst my girl friends I find
more and more of them using
Rexona every day, and I am glad
to write and tell you what excel-
lent things Rexona and Rexona
Soap are for surfers.

fpjHE windy hills have heard your heel
I Pass like a whisper across the grass,
And many a lazy daisy-wheel
Has circled to see you gaily pass;
And many a browsing drowsy bee
Has heard the lilt o’ your laugh with
dread,
I.est the whirling skirt at your moving knee
Should bring his kingdom about his head.
Oh, the shining, golden, olden days
That were dear to have and so hard to
miss,
When every hour knew a tender phrase,
And the sun went down to the sound of a
kiss!
I have been wooing words to-night,
Words as cool as a pale sea mist,
To weave them into a garland white
As the flow’r-like white of your curving
wrist.
But many a thought of a laughing time,
Of paths we trod and of joys we knew,
Flood the mind like a happy chime.
And magic pictures are breaking through.
So the delicate words that my heart would
speak
Are lost ’mid the music of stronger things ;
And the harp is throbbing against my cheek,
And my fingers leap to the stronger strings.
We twain, who are one with the arching
skies
And the rumbling beach where the big
waves fall.
Have passed the hand across wond’ring eyes
At the .marvel and mystery of it all;
And, marvelling, turned in the magic days
On the dim land’s rim, ’mid the thin swift
air,
And I found in your dear, clear, level gaze
The marvel of marvels shining there;
So my altar is set in a sacred place,
On the topmost hill ’mid a silent land ;
And I pray my prayer in the ears of space,
And the gods and a girl will understand.
1 pray 'that the gods may keyp you wise
In the wonder-lore which the Outroads
teach.
And the psalms which rise where the great
hills rise.
And tin* hymns that ring from the windy
beach,
In the chant that wells from the leaves of
trees,
The call of waters, the cry of birds ;
Of nights which loiter across the seas
And speak with beauty more rich than
words,
And the faith in such wonders manifold :
Worlds that spin through the outer
spheres,
Nights of storm and morns of gold.
Oh. I pray the gods that the Faith I hold
May be your faith through the marching
years!
Dear, pale forehead and dusky tress.
Frail little fingers and cool white hands,
Bide in my memory still to bless
Weary journeys through lonely lands!
And one more prayer do I pray to-night
That in time of storm, when the tears of
rain
Gleam where the wistful candle-light
Falls on the dark-walled window-pane—
I pray that some joy from the golden days
The voice of a flower, a ribbon, a curl.
May speak to my heart of the open ways
That were trod by the gods and a wonder-
girl.
Dusk ! The glimmer of stars, and soon
Comes Evening, sweet as a vesper hymn,
And the broad and mellow September moon
Like a Janthorn swings o’er the ocean rim !
Oh. the delicate joys of the ingle-nook !
The titter of children! * The mother-call!
The rustling leaves of an old-world book
And the nibbling mouse in the darkened
hall!
Hey.' the pathway blurs on the weary sight,
Past whispering gorse down the windy
steep !
Girl! may your dreams be fair to-night!
Farewell! Light laughter, and deep, deep
sleep !
MAORILAND.
BOYCE BOWDEN.
A Crooks’ Deal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TWO dust-covered and disreputable-
looking travellers made camp at
Sleepy Hollow as the sun dropped
behind a wooded rise in the immediate back-
ground. They had a pack-horse and a
saddle-horse between them. The latter they
had ridden, turn about, all day, one mount-
ing for a couple of miles at a time while
the other walked. In fact, that had been
their method of travelling for three weeks
past, and both were heartily tired of the
process. The pack-horse was about knocked
up. lie was also slightly lame. Obviously
he wanted a spell as much as his owners
wanted a change, but the pair had no money.
Nevertheless they resolved to do some deal-
ing.
At his best the old pack-horse was worth
about a fiver. To get £IU for him, and to
raise enough on the hack to buy a third
horse, was the contract they set themselves
to carry out within the next 24 hours. They
lived mainly on their wits, these two, who
addressed one another as Bob and Joe, and
apparently the wits had been at work, with
designs on two persons in Sleepy Hollow,
before they arrived within its peaceful pre-
cincts.
While Bob made a fire and boiled the
hilly Joe had a wash and changed his
clothes ; then he set out on foot for a house
on the outskirts of the town, leading the
pack-horse, which had nothing on him now
but a halter. The place selected was the
residence of Bill Waggles, with whom Joe
was slightly acquainted, and who did a little
dealing at times when he was dead-certain
of making something out of it. He had a
well-grassed allotment alongside, which was
apparently the object of Joe’s visit, for he
asked at once if he might leave the animal
in it for the night; he'd had a horse im-
pounded at Sleepy Hollow once, and was
afraid of letting this one run loose on the
Hat. Bill had no objection.
While they put the moke in the paddock
Joe talked of the hard roads he had been
travelling for months on end, and inci-
dentally mentioned that he didn’t like part-
ing with the old horse, hut as times were so
bad there was no help for it.
“I’ll sell ’im to you for a tenner,” Joe said
finally. “He ain’t much to look at now, but
when, lie’s in condition ver can't beat ’im.”
Bill Waggles grinned scornfully and shook
his head. Joe left then; and as soon as he
returned to camp Bob mounted the hack and
rode down past Waggles’s. He eyed the old
pack-horse critically as he rounded the
vacant block, seeming to be greatly inter
ested in him. Bill Waggles was leaning over
his gate.
“That’s not a bad sort of a neddy yer
got there,” Bob remarked. “I fancy I know
'im, too.” He slewed in his saddle and had
another look. “Didn’t he used to belong to
old Joe Weary?”
“That’s him,” said Waggles.
“What do yer want for ’im?”
“Twelve pounds,” Waggles promptly
answered, a twinkle in his eyes.
To his surprise Bob went into the pad
dock to have a closer look at the moke. He
looked in his mouth, he lifted up all his feet,
and viewed him from fore and aft and from
both sides.
“I’ll take ’im at that,” he said, coming
back. “He’s a hit low, but I know what lie
can do when lie’s in nick. I’ll call with tli’
money an’ get ’im in th’ mornin’.”
Mr. Waggles was thinking hard. He had
been joking at first, but the prosoect of
making two pounds altered the position.
“Call about dinner-time,” he said. “I’ll
be away, workin’ on a job, to near about
that time.”
“Right,” said Bob. “I’ll he along.”
Leaving Mr. Waggles, he rode round to
Josh Taylor’s nlace, where lie obtained per-
mission to paddock the hack. He also in-
structed Mr. Taylor if lie could get a fiver
for the quadruped in the meantime to sell
him. and he could have five per cent, com-
mission. Josh Taylor didn’t like hard work
lie always avoided it when he could but he
was mostly on the look-out for little com-
missions.
“I think I can get that for him,” he said
musingly. “He’s not a bad stamp.”
“In good fettle lie’s well worth fifteen
quid,” said Bob. “I refused as much for
him six months ago. He was in fust-rate
nick then, an’ attractin’ notice wherever I
rode ’im; but since he's got poor nobody
looks at ’im —’s if th’ beast couldn’t put on
condition ag’in if he ’ad tli’ chance. Anyone
with ’alf an eye can see he’s a ’orse that’ll
improve with feedin’. That’s all he wants —
plenty o’ feed an' a good spell; an’ he’s
worth 15 poun’ of any man’s money. If yer
can trade ’im, there lie is, trade him.”
In the morning Bob remained in camp
while Joe went out. Joe was away about
two hours, and then he returned with the
hack and a new pack-horse.
“So you worked th’ oracle, Joe?” Bob
remarked pleasantly.
Joe grinned. “Bill Waggles ’as got a job
drovin’, an’ wanted a ’orse in a hurry. So
he give me a tenner for tli’ old packer. I
bought your hack with half of it, after a
lot o’ barneyin’ with old Josh, an’ got this
other moke from tli’ blacksmith with the
balance.”
“Good biz!” said Bob. “We’re doin’
famous, Joe. To-morrer we’ll both be
mounted an’ a-drivin’ our pack-’orse, an’
life will be a lot rosier.”
Later in the day, whilst Mr. Waggles
was waiting, at first with benign patience,
then anxiously, for an expected buyer. Boh
called on Josh Taylor and demanded his
horse. .Tosh met him with a beaming face.
He tendered £4 15s. with the explanation
that he had sold the quadruped for the stipu-
lated figure, and deducted his commission as
agreed upon. Boh stared blankly at him
without offering to take the money.
“Ain’t that right?” Mr. Taylor queried.
“Five pounds you said, wasn’t it?”
“No-o!” Boh looked genuinely surprised.
“If I said anything about values, I said the
’orse was worth fifteen quid—an’ that’s my
price.”
Josh Taylor’s face turned ashy grey.
“What sort o’ game’s this?” he demanded
wrathfully. “You told me if I could get a
fiver for him to sell him. didn’t yer?”
Bob couldu’t recollect anything about it.
He confessed to having a very poor memory,
in consequence of which he usually insisted
on having any important agreement put in
black and white; but positively no man in
his riuht senses would part with an animal
like that for such a paltry sum. Josh Tay-
lor. spluttering in his indignation and fear,
repeated the conversation they had had
about the beast, his forefinger playing on his
opposite palm to clinch the points, and
demanded once more: “Ain’t that right?”
“Where’s yer witness?” Boh asked him.
Josh Taylor’s face went a shade paler, and
there was a scintillating, snake-like glitter
in his eyes. “You know blasted well there
was no witness.”
“Then what’s the use o’ arguin’?” said
Bob. “I want my ’orse or fifteen qu'd.”
Air. Taylor responded that he would see
Robert in a particularly sultry place before
he’d get either. “You’re nothing but a dirty
scoundrel, that’s, what you are,” he con-
cluded. giving little hitches to his shirt-
sleeves as if he meditated something violent.
“I’m rot goin’ to stand ’ere to be in-
sulted,” Bob returned, stepping back out of
reach. “If the sergeant gets to hear that
yer sold another man's ’orse. he'll put you
somewhere without the option o’ payin’.”
Josh Taylor glared in speechless rage.
“I s’oose it would mean seven years’
’ard.” Bob added reflectively. .
Taylor’s face took on an uglier look. He
moved slowly forward like a man in a
dream. Bob closed the argument by slip-
ping out through the gate. As he was about
to depart, Josh Taylor’s manner as quickly
changed.

KIDNEY DISEASE
TAKES
YOU
UNAWARES.
You don’t know you have it until it has you.
SO QUIET is kidney disease in its approach that it is often mistaken
for some other complaint. The woman who is tired all the day, sleepless
the night through; who is anaemic, irritable, nervous; who suffers from
dizzy spells, lheumatism, headache; whose eyelids are puffy and swollen —she
puts down her trouble to some female complaint instead of to the real cause
the kidneys. The man whose back is weak, whose limbs drag, who has dis-
tiessing urinary troubles, dropsy, gravel—he never suspects his kidnevs
which aie the real cause of his illness. This is why kidney disease is so serious
and so generally fatal.
If don t feel as well as you ought, do not neglect your kidneys
another day, but begin at once with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, because
they are special kidney help; because the genuine Doan’s Pills" are made from
Pure vegetable loots and herbs, and are therefore reliable and safe for old
and young ; because men and women who have been cured tell so earnestly
and sincerely how Doan’s Pills have cured them.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
FROM NORTH SYDNEY.
„ Mr. Henry Holder, “Euronga,” Amhurst Street,
North Sydney, says: “Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are, indeed, a wonderful kidney medicine-
I have proved this. For a long time I suffered
agony from backache and kidney trouble, and
only those who have been afflicted in this way have
any idea what I went through. My limbs swelled
considerably, the kidney secretions were thick and
cloudy with a red sediment, and I had agonising
pains in my back. When I stooped it was as
much as I could do to stand up straight again
without assistance, my back was so stiff and lame.
I was treated by a doctor, and tried all sorts of
remedies, but nothing gave me the slightest relief.
1 was naturally very worried about the serious
state of my health, and when Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills were brought under my notice I
decided to try them. It was a grand thing for me
that I got this remedy, for seven bottles cured me
completely. 1 cannot speak too highly of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and recommend them with
every confidence to other sufferers.”
FROM CAMPERDOWN.
Mrs. T. Smith, i>7 Briggs Street, Camperdown,
Sydney, says: “A member of my family suffered
iigony from rheumatic pains all over the body, and
was completely crippled with the ailment for
months. The pains were particularly severe
across the small of the hack, just over the kidneys.
We had a doctor treating the case for a good while,
hut his medicine did not do any good, and at last
he said he was afraid nothing more could be done.
We then tried hospital treatment, but that also
failed. It was right on top of this that we were
advised to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
although we had very little hope that they would
do any good, we got some to try them. ' After
taking two or three bottles there was a little
improvement, so we persevered with them until a
perfect cure was effected, using in all twelve
bottles. We cannot say enough in praise of
Doan s Backache Kidney Pills, and consider the
cure a marvellous one.”

DOAN’S, REMEMBER!
“Here, come inside,” he said in quieter
tones.
Bob was doubtful about the prudence of
accepting the invitation.
“Come inside an’ I’ll settle up with yer,”
said the other, turning indoors.
Bob was shown into the front room,
where he was left for a couple of minutes
while Josh conferred in undertones with
Mrs. Taylor. When he returned he had a
bundle of notes in one hand and writing
materials in the other. He counted out
fifteen notes, folded them up neatly, and
clasping the roll tightly in his hand, shook
it across the table with the remark:
“There’s your money.”
Bob stretched out an eager hand to con-
nect with it, but Taylor drew it back.
“I want a receipt first,” he said, shoving
the writing materials over, “or you might
forget I paid yer.”
r ' Bob wrote out the usual receipt. Josh
Taylor read it over three times to make
sure it meant all that it said, after which he
folded it up as carefully as he had folded
the notes and put it in his pocket. Then
with painful deliberation he counted out
£4 155., and put the balance of the money in
his other pocket. Bob gazed on the proceed-
ing with chilled amazement.
“There’s your money,” Taylor reminded
him. “Yer hat’s on the floor, ain’t it?”
‘/The amount’s 15 pound,” Bob protested.
“You can call it what you like.” Josh
Taylor replied. “I’m a bit of a rogue
meself, I don’t mind tollin’ yer.” He tapped
his pocket. “This bit o’ paper says you sold
the ’orse for value received. That’s the end
of the argument. Now get.”
He held the door open in an aggres.\ive
manner. Bob dragged his hat on with the
air of a man who was trying to determine
where he was, and slouched dejectedly out.
It was too apparent that Taylor had cor-
rectly described himself.
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
The Confession.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ A WOMAN knows she’s a woman
J-\ long before she is one, really. After
that, especially if she marries, she
gets over it a lot. That’s what makes flap-
pers so aggressive. Their very shyness flings
the fact that they’re women at a cove who
might not otherwise have thought of it.”
The Smoodger is a man of vague morality,
but mighty in human philosophy. Still, he
never throws away the pearls of his wisdom
unless he is stirred by the sight of sorji'one
whose story he has studied. So I waited,
while he consumed half his mug of beer.
“There was a man in here a while
ago,” he said, wiping his moustache with the
side of his coat, because he hates stains on
his sleeve, “who married a girl I’ve known all
me life. There was nothing wrong with her
when she was a flapper except that she teas
one; and that led to the trouble. She picked
up with a young feller called Allen, and
started going out with him. I don’t
her; I blame her people. A girl, when she’s
only a flapper, wants looking after, I don’t
care who she is. She’s got no real idea of
what’s what, and’s likely to get carried away
by what she thinks are romantic and senti-
mental ideas, which aren’t; and, besides, she
knows she’s a woman.
“If it hadn’t been that, there’d have been
no harm. Allen wasn’t a bad young feller,
and he liked the girl. She was a handsome
little piece, with a taking manner about
her. But that flapperism of hers was a direct
challenge to his masculine instincts: it’s the
sort of thing that merely amuses a man who
is grown up, but to a youngster who tries
hard to think that he is grown up it is differ-
ent. Allen turned himself into a Don Juan
merely because he thought that the girl would
despise him as a mere boy if he didn’t. She
quarrelled with him at first, but she didn’t
avoid meeting him when he showed he was
not to be choked off.
“Her parents had no sense about the way
they looked after the girl. But I’ll say this
for them: when they found out things they
hadn’t any of the usual foolishness that
some people have about insisting on a mar-
riage. Of course, the thing was impossible ;
although Allen was willing to do the square
thing—if the marrying of two people who
didn’t know their own minds and had
nothing to live on is the square thing. May’s
father merely expressed his intention of
killing .Vilen, and chased him off. And May,
who, no doubt, felt she had a romance, with
a broken heart and so on, cried a lot and
sobered up, becoming a nice, quiet girl who
swore she’d never marry—until she met Bill
•Jones.
“She married Bill. People think they’re
in love when they marry; they find out
afterwards if they are or are not —some-
times a long time after. Bill and May got
on like most married people who have
hitched up with the in-love-with-one-another
idea. They made plans about the little
home of their own they were going to build
and live like lovers in; postponed them to
meet the expenses of the new baby; and
renewed them after the baby arrived. And
then they settled down to forget their
dream and take life just as they found it.
“Then Allen came back. He’d been away
to the Boer war, and stayed in South
Africa, where he had all the experience
that was good for him. The old incident
had been forgotten, and even May showed
no sign of rememberinsr it. Anyway, Bill
knew nothing of it, and made Allen one
of his pals. As Bill didn’t mind how often
lie saw his pals at his house, that was good
for Allen. And May, who had known him
when he was a boy, and, as I said, had got
over her flapperish notions, liked to see him.
They would talk over childhood’s days to-
gether, and became quite chums.
“But it was different with Allen. The
affair had done him more harm than it had
May. He had been a decent young fellow,
but wasn’t now. The fact that Bill had
made him his pal and trusted him was
nothing to him. He was piqued because
May ignored what had happened long ago,
and treated him only as a chum, and he set
out to make love to her.
“She froze him when he tried to recall old
times that were too recent to be pleasant;
but when she got cold he got hot. And one
day he went too far.
“She just sprang up, tore herself away
from his arm and flung open the door.
“ ‘Go !’ she said.
“ ‘I mean to have you,’ he said, ‘or if I
don’t I’ll settle with you. Do you think I’m
going to stand by watching you living with
him, and all but ignoring me? I’ll let him
know all that happened !’
“ ‘You cur!’ she said. ‘Go!’
“ ‘l’ll give you time to think of it,’ he said,
with an ugly grin; ‘but mind what I say!’.
“How much she did mind I saw when I
called in a little while later. You see I
know, because —-well, because we were
cousins, and brought up pretty well like
brother and sister. As a matter of fact. I’d
told her it wasn’t the thing to have Allen
about, and she’d only smiled at the idea;
and that’s why she spoke to me about it. She
was pretty well broken up.
“ ‘Don’t you worry,’ I told her. ‘I know
a few blokes, and we’ll clear the mongrel
out of the neighborhood. He won’t want
to come here again.’
“ ‘But.’ she said, ‘then he’ll only let Bill
know by letter, just out of spite. He’s a
cad ; lie’s capable of anything.’
“And she leaned her head on her hands,
sobbing.
“ ‘Well, cheer up. May,’ I says awkwardly,
seeing everything about it, that you were
only a girl and you’ve been a good wife, Bill
may not feel so bad about it. He might
overlook it.’
She sprang up with her breast heaving.
“ ‘Chiller,’ she cried. ‘I can’t stand it!
Bven if Bill forgave me for the children’s
sake, it will raise a barrier between us—it
must! I love Bill, Chiller, I love him; and
I couldn’t bear it!’
“ ‘I know you’re a true wife to Bill,’ I
says, ‘but I thought you’d got over feeling
like that.’
“‘I thought so, but I haven’t. If any-
thing came between me and Bill. Chiller, I
feel it’d break my heart!’
„ ‘‘You see it’s what I said about people
finding out if they love one another after
they’re married; and May had found out
just because of Allen. _ She was so tragical
about it that I couldn t say nothing except
to suggest that Allen might not say any-
thing, after all.
He will! He will!’ she sobbed. ‘I
know he will!’ Then an idea struck her.
But he won’t be the first to do it. I'll tell
Bill myself!’
“The idea staggered me a bit, but Bill came
1 ome just then. Afterwards, when I took
a chance to get out, she did tell him.
“ ‘Bill,’ she said, going up to him, caress-
ingly, you don’t seem to care for me as you
a seel to. Don’t you love me?’
Oh, of course I love you, old girl’ he
answered. ‘What’s the matter? Ain't von
feeling well?’ ‘
“ ‘Bill,’ she said, ‘I want you to do some-
tinng tor me: I want you to send \llen
I don’t like him. He’s not your
friend. Oh, Bill, I want you to forgive me "
“The agitation of her tone disturbed him
1 saw him go a sort of whitewash, looking
at her. now kneeling at his knee. I saw it
through the window.
‘‘‘What’s the matter?’ he asked.
“ <Bill - he’s been trying to make love to
me. I want to tell you—l should have be-
fore. But, oh, Bill, do, do forgive me!*
“And she made her confession in her own
way, her face tragical, her arms on his knees.
“When she had finished, or before lie
sprang to his feet with a fury that only a
good-natured man, really angry, can show.
‘l’ll kill the mongrel!’ he shouted, ‘i’ll
rip the skin from his body !’
“ ‘But, Bill, will you forgive me?’ she
pleaded. ‘I love you. Bill; I love you, dear.’
“He turned towards her—he’d been rush-
ing to the door—with a softer passion show-
ing through his anger.
“ ‘Of course I forgive you, Maisie,’ he
said. ‘You’re a good girl and a good wife.’
“ ‘And love me, Bill?’ she insisted. ‘lt
won’t make any difference.’
“He hesitated a minute ; and then he took
her in his arms like a young lover taking
his first kiss.
“ ‘lt’ll make this difference, that we’re
going to have that little place out a bit
and all the things we used to think about.’
“I got away then. But I was present
when he fixed Allen up next day. He
stopped the mongrel directly he saw him.
“‘I want a word with you,’ be said. ‘You
know what about.’
“Allen only had to look at his face to
guess; but, although he paled, he raised a
sneer.
“ ‘You didn’t suppose you were the first’ —
“Before he got further Bill’s fist caught
him on the jaw. It was a ding-dong go
before they were parted, but Allen, once he
got away, didn’t want to face it again. There
is a cowardice in every man’s heart about
a man he has wronged, or attempted to
wrong. •
“And now,” concluded the Smoodger.
“they've got the place they wanted, and
they’re so love-like that when Bill comes in
for a beer, he dashes away again in a minute
so as to catch his train and get home early.”
“He must be a good sort,” I commented.
“He overlooked altogether what his wife had
told him?”
“You oughter know about women!” he
said. “What she told him was that she had
been sweethearting with Allen when she was
a girl, and had let him kiss her; and she
felt ashamed of having let any other man
kiss her, especially as Allen was using it as
an excuse for making love to her. You
know what women are !
“After that,” finished the Smoot ;er,
reflectively, “Bill would have thought Allen
just a revengeful liar if he had said anything
more.”
