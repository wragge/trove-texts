POEMS BY
JAMES DEVANEY.
Paper Cover, 36 pages. Price 2/6 (2/8 posted).
A book no lover of good Australian Poetry
should miss.
This is one of the most delightful collections
of poems we have had the privilege of ha lul-
ling. The intensity and sincerity impress one
throughout, whilst here and theTe the music
of a verse stirs the emotions.
READ THE REVIEWS:—
“It is full of the fire of poetry. Some of
the poetry is crude in form, but the funda-
mental stuff is in it. We hope that he may
be long spared to cultivate an undoubtedly rich
poetical gift. He has a strong love of nature,
and he reveals himself as a fond student of
good literature.”— The Australasian.
“He attains a measure of beauty by his sim-
plicity in such verses as ‘Farewell,’ etc.”— Age.
“If he can maintain the admirable standard
set, he soon should be able to command a large
and highly appreciative circle of readers. He
certainly possesses true poetic feelings.”
—Weekly Times.
“There is much of noble work before the
author yet, and, with re-established health,
we may hope to see fly out from a genuinely
poetic soul the skylarks of melody whose aim
is heaven’s portal.”— Advocate.
“Mr. Devaney has in him one poetic gift
none too common in Australia—a sense of
rhythm and a liking for unhackneyed metres.”

The Missing Critics
A recent article in The Bulletin quoted
the opinion of a travelled European on Art
in Australia. “You have no opinions upon
Art in Australia,” he said, “and you never
will have as long as serious discussion is dis-
allowed.” Quite true; but the stricture
evidently applied to graphic art, and it would
have even more force if literature wa.s in
question. There is practically no criticism
of such literary work as is produced in Aus-
tralia, and consequently no responsive public.
A few books of merit see the light; they re-
ceive a mechanical salute from fatigued re-
viewers on the daily papers, and then they
fall back into oblivion. Good writing in
Australia has never brought either cash or
attention. What wonder that there is so
little of it?
The lack of attention is the most import-
ant matter, for, in spite of what may be said
to the contrary, most writers do want to
know that they have an audience. Payment
is, after all, a secondary consideration.
Would any man do good work to drop down
a hole, even though he were assured that he
would get special rates for it? Well, hardly.
The best writers have often scrapped their
inferior work rather than take money for it;
and, anyhow, no one has the illusion that
the best work brings the best pay, in this
or any other country. What it ought to
bring is serious attention, and an attempt
on the part of the critics to discover its
special quality. -
Is there any such attempt? Dowell
O’Reilly recently confessed in The Bulletin
that, after 25 years of writing, he was ex-
cited to find a couple of lines about his work
in a rdsume by an unknown critic! The in-
stance is typical. How many serious esti-
mates have there been of the work of Ran-
dolph Bedford, Louis Esson, Arthur Adams,
Hugh McGrae, Furnley Maurice, David
McKee Wright, Louis Stone, Shaw Neilson,
to name only a few contemporary writers?
Practically none. The impersonal, critical
atmosphere is so lacking that anyone writing
of these men would feel that he was giving
to the world what was meant for private
conversation. It is not customary to write
objectively of the work of friends. There
might be suggestions either of back-scratch-
ing or of underhand attack. And anony-
mous criticism, in Australia, is mainly con-
fined to people who know little of books and
care less.
But that is not the whole trouble. The
truth is that original criticism is difficult in
itself. When we feel inclined to write, a
literary article it is so much easier to seize
on some new English novelist or poet, w r ho,
of course, is not so new that he has escaped
being placed by a dozen previous articles in
overseas reviews. A short glimpse at his
life, a resume of his latest work, a few bright
sentences about his quality, and the thing is
done! It is so different from struggling to
form a just estimate of a nearer contempo-
rary, whose shape often looks amorphous,
his tail buried in the sand of yesterday’s
journalism, his claws in controversial matter,
and his head in some cloud or other. Aus-
tralian writers never provide their critics
with neatly-arranged materials. Their books
are out of print or hard to get, and they
rarely make an occasion by writing a new
one. Meanwhile English writers provide
countless occasions, and estimates are
adjusted and re-adjusted as each book drops
hot from the printing-presses.
Everything seems to combine to further
the provincial habit of gossiping about what-
ever has a London vogue for the time being.
The young people in the “literary” circles
of our universities can quote Charles Sorley
and tell you all about the Sitwells, and they
have made vicarious rebellion with every
minor poet (whether Oxford or Cambridge)
who has lifted his voice against the universe
in the last few years. This is all very well,
but provincialism is a sort of lava that
smothers life as it spreads. I knew a dis-
tinguished editor who had a way of striking
the name of every Australian writer out of
the literary causeries he printed. His idea
seemed to be that there was a slight rawness
about any name that had not appeared in
the English Spectatob ; in fact, the very
sight of an Australian name in print gave
him a queer, physical shock. It was not
that he wanted to assert his literary judg-
ment. He merely believed that there was a
certain habit and tradition to be followed —
people you could mention in a dignified
column and people you could not.
Personally, I spent the first 10 years of
my writing life in London, among certain
groups that have since become prominent,
and the morbid respect of most Australians
for any name that has been sufficiently rever-
berated has never ceased to puzzle me. Lon-
don is a good, forcing-house. If a man has
it in him to write one good book, it will
teach him to write a dozen with easy
adequacy, and will provide all the materials.
But what does all this spurious fecundity
amount to in the long run ? I have known
a good many of the writers who have come
to the front in the last few years, and they
have not been giants. They are quite compe-
tent, quite articulate, and they have pub-
lishers waiting to print anything they want
to write. But creative ability! It is just
as rare as among the handful of Australian
writers I know who are working in obscurity.
Except for half-a-dozen elders, there will be
a different brood to gossip about in 20
years time, and nothing we can say will affect
the mortality of either.
Literature is not merely a matter of abso-
lute values, though, and Australian writing
has an importance for us, apart from any
universal standard. Perhaps the general in-
difference to it is no greater than it always
was, though sometimes it seems as if once
there was more eager criticism. A more
alert attention, too! But things would be
no better if writers were paragraphed as
much as artists now are. Indiscriminate
publicity does no one any good, even from a
financial point of view, for a certain enter-
prising person recently proved that the whirl-
wind methods of advertising which were
effective with dried currants could not sell
books or create an interest in them. What is
wanted is a little genuine criticism, in order
that it may be discovered what has been
done in Australian literature, and what is
being done to-day. There is a big opening
for a competent critic, and even a few merely
industrious ones would be welcome.
VANCE PALMER.
Prose and Romance
It lias been said that, the ideal essay is a
poem in a state of diffusion. Whether or
not the inferred connection is admitted, with
or without reservations, it helps to describe
the work contained in Furnley Maurice’s
prose-book, Romance (Melbourne: Sydney J.
Endacott). This is not to say that these
essays are florid or have anything in com-
mon with so-called “prose-poems.” They
are, on the contrary, simple and direct in
expression. “The passion for novelty, epi-
gram and crazy candor,” says the author of
them, “draws us away from life. The old
slow way of writing (if you can do it) is
best in the long run. And most of us will
live to see the firework stylists go right out.”
But his facts, which are intellectual in sub-
stance, are visioned rather than reasoned,
and the ideas cohere, but without the logical
kind of elaboration. This explains why most
of the pieces are so short. Sustained writ-
ing cannot get along without sequences.
These essays average perhaps six or seven
pages each —except a longer one at the end
of the book, a capable essay on “Celtic
Writers and the Celtic Movement.”
Furnley Maurice is pretty well known (so
far as Australian poets can be said to be
known) as the author of half-a-dozen verse-
publications. This, his first prose-book, . has
a dedication which, taking the risks of inti-
macy, tells how “into this world of our
imagining came life, a little speck of it, the
baby,” the dedication being to his mother.
Thence are physical facts, with “pain and
terror and great anxiety.” In the same way
the remembrance of the common experiences
of life, which belong to all, chasten without
diminishing loftier speculation. “Make your
heaven out of what happens to you,” he
urges. Romance has never set foot on earth.
“The hungry souls of people yearning for
glamor must supply from their own imagina-
tions their crying need for miraculous
things.” For “only imagination is perfect.
It is a flame that can live under water.”
This is very wide-awake dreaming. It really
satirises reality. The burden of an essay
on courage is, “After hope there is courage.”
The lesson is enforced by a characteristic in-
tonation. “So after hope there is courage.
The highest courage outsoars hope. It
would sometimes appear that hope is a means
by which the soul consciously deludes itself
into deferring the realisation of danger.” A
blind understanding, perhaps; but what is
the fact of living but an act of faith! St.
Peter’s keys ivere right enough at one time;
then came the rationalists with Yale locks
and a “To Let” board, and now. the Ameri-
can tourist habit has given rise to the
spiritual cracksman with skeleton keys. Who
was it spoke of “mock-turtle religions”?
Of the several literary papers included,
one has to do with “National Poetry.” Furn-
ley Maurice wants it, though he confesses
he does not know what it is. “There is
something baffling about modern American
poetry,” lie says, “but there is no mystery
about the poetry that is printed in Australia
to-day. It is the last word in conventional
English verse-production. It is done to worn-
out patterns discarded in the land of their
origin. It is more conventional in form and
matter than any verse now published in Eng-
land by English poets. The undergraduates
of Oxford, the home of scholastic tradition,
show more daring in their verses, a more
hopeful and youthful adventuresomeness than
the rhyme-worn poets of this sunny land
of ours, who warble proper sentiments in
correct measures.” He suggests that per-
haps “the American poets are doing their
work so well that the hatred they stir in
our bosoms is engendered, not by the poetry
itself, but by the America it reveals so
vividly.” Exactly! The verse produced in
a madhouse might be a true expression of
the mentality of the place, but that would
be a very good reason for not taking it seri-
ously. One can sympathise with the impa-
tience of a critic whose own achievement as
a poet is not in the rut, and the mention of
contemporary English verse, though not the
American, is apt for the purpose of a stone-
thrower who does not live in a glass-house.
A paper on James Hebblethwaite gains
the obituary gentleness of epitaph from its
subject, and another, as swiftly comprehen-
sive, and dealing with Francis Thompson,
contains illuminating passages that do not
get their chance in a piece of writing that is
largely made up of introductory matter. The
essay on the Celtic Movement is more expan-
sive. It rightly points out that a literary
school that walks backward cannot have a
future. While not attempting to define Pro-
gress, he thinks it is “a dogma we must
anchor ourselves to. It is a small, secure
niche in the wall of experience into which
one can swing for safety, like a monkey, at
any cry of danger. To accomplish anything
great or useful (especially when we set out
to earn fame or a martyr’s crown during
lunch-hour), we must believe something
deeply. It is reasonable to believe that pro-
gress is right.” In one of the other essays
he speaks of W. B. Yeats holding down the
warm body of humanity with a marble hand.
Lady Gregory’s “ultimate ineffectiveness is
due to her incorrigible habit of. experiment-
ing with a bad national memory, which,
among the more political. class of Irish bard,
at one time developed into an unforgiving
rancor.” Perhaps he says too much for
Synge as realist. It is right enough to say
that Synge was “an artist watching life,”
but this watching does not make for “direct
contact with life.” An Australian once said
something to Synge about bushmen who are
supposed to go slowly mad in lonely places.
“Are they not interesting while they are
going mad?” asked Synge. This is the
abstract attitude. Furnley Maurice’s own
cadences, here in his prose as well as else-
where in his verse, have the windy echo of
(Continued on page S .)

Stories for Children
When my brother’s first, book appeared in
New York, about three years ago, the Ameri-
can critics said, in their engaging exuber-
ance of manner, that he was a second Lewis
Carroll. Naturally, I am quite willing to
concede that anything done by a brotner of
mine is a remarkable piece of work; but
“a second Lewis Carroll” was a bit hot. It
put me off The Story of Doctor Dolittle
(Jonathan Cape) before I opened it. But
not for long. Two pages put me thoroughly
on it; I finished it at a sitting, and read it
through again the following day. In the
first flush of my enthusiasm I wrote a couple
of reviews of the book, which, for some
reason, were not posted. In the interim I
listened to the book being read to the kids;
and, instead of posting my reviews, I tore
them up. The book was already in its sixth
American edition, and Llugh had got the
profitable American lecture-tour out of it,
and was writing another. So I didn’t See
that I was doing much harm by saying no-
thing here, particularly as I was not sure
of my judgment. When the second book
turned up I thought I could probably trust
myself with more confidence.
The difficulty was that I could see my
young brother all the time ; and the picture
of the boy of 30 years ago got between me
and my judgment of his work. I hadn’t real-
ised until I heard the book read that possibly
my enthusiasm was for the faithfulness of
the picture rather than for the remarkable
work. “The Story of Doctor Dolittle” re-
cords in an ambling, casual, humorous solem-
nity of manner the Doctor’s learning of the
animals’ language, their love for him, and
his astonishing cures of their ridiculous ail-
ments. The quite inconsequent plot drifts
from England to Africa and back at will;
none of the incidents matters. The thing is
the animals’ language and its obviously wide
possibilities. When Hugh was a boy he
was always hobnobbing with worms and
stoats and pigeons. IIe i used to_ dig up
dead dogs and bring their heads in about
an hour before dinner and set to work to
boil them to skeletons, to the passionate de-
spair of our mother. He had a standing retinue
of live dogs and bantams and goldfish, who
were always begging at the back door in
multitudes. He chatted interminably to
these things (people, I nearly wrote) ; I
believe he used to read to them. So you can
see my difficulty in judging Doctor Dolittle.
But the other book has turned up—
The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle (Frederick
A. Stokes Co.) ; and I think I know. where
I am now. Of course, “a second Lewis Car-
roll” is rather silly—not because Hugh’s
matter is inferior to that of Lewis Carroll,
but because it is different. De Morgan is
not a second Dickens any more than Henry
Lawson is a second Chaucer, or a last year’s
apple a second split infinitive. Men who
write from the heart never follow other men.
There is analogy in the sublime inconse-
quence of both Lewis Carroll and Hugh
Lofting", as there is in the excellence of both
men’s matter; but that is all.
Hugh has no style, no technique. He dedi-
cates his first book to “children in years
and children in heart” ; but that is the only
hint of consciousness I can find throughout
both books, and that might be only chance
or the traditional gesture made uncon-
sciously. His matter is as clear and simple
as running water. It is not “demure” or
“twinkling,” as the American critics said ; it
is straight, with only the faint coloring of
the obvious sense of humor which made for
him that magnificent game of affably convers-
ing with ferrets and slugs and robins 30
years ago. The absurd stories amble on to
no end save that of laughter for me and
delighted wonder for the kids. He charac-
terises his animals with as much vision and
confidence as were used to put Soames For-
sythe on paper, and without the trappings
of Galsworthy’s technique. You know the
animals backwards, as you know the cheery,
casual Doctor who is the childlike guiding
spirit. They become personalities, friends,
inspiring companions; Hugh establishes a
link between the two kingdoms, not only
for the children whose fugitive imaginings
seem to come true, but for hardening grown-
ups and middle-ageds who, in Dolittle, can
recapture for a passing moment the buried
magic. The recapturing comes as a half-
thought, one of those groping memories you
can’t quite grip, and certainly can’t define
or describe; but it’s there. Once or twice I
have quite shed the 30 years in reading Do-
little—have taken my unthinking, inexperi-
enced place beside his motherly parrots and
his crotchety, kind-hearted mongrel dogs. One
takes it that that is the way to write stories
for children ; certainly it gives you all seven
ages of childhood for audience.
HILARY LOFTING.
“Modern” Art
The collection of European art now being-
exhibited in Australia contains little that is
strikingly good, much that is strikingly tame,
and much from the extreme schools that
is very bad, but should provide considerable
mental exercise for the Australian who thinks
deeply about art. To dismiss the adventu-
rous modern schools with a sneer is to miss
the valuable lesson to be learned from them.
To examine them carefully and seek the rea-
son for their failure to stir our appreciation
means the re-discovery of fundamentals in
art; and this eventually will place our own
woi’k on a more secure path than most of it
is following at present.
All that is bad in modern art is the direct
outcome of the modern admission of the claim
for absolute freedom of individual thought.
It has produced an easy toleration for any
jaunt into the realms of loose thinking. The
merely brilliant sketcher, the stringer of
high-sounding- sentences, the mentally indo-
lent and lame in art, engineering their own
applause, become each to a large and increas-
ing section “the greatest mind in the world
to-day” and such like. But man is only
man. and all his talk of “high creative
minds” is mere twaddle, after all. Inexorable
laws render futile all his attempts to grasp
absolute freedom: his sincerest efforts to
create new forms of harmony in defiance ot
those laws succeed only in creating chaos.
The exhibition of European art confronts
us suddenly with many examples of the work
of the extreme schools and enables us to see
broadly the whole development at a glance.
With the first shock the desire to be generous
avails nothing. These painters who claim
to be wholly concerned with stirring aesthetic
emotion stir the opposite emotions to the
utmost. Recollection of their vast influence
brings despair at the realisation of human-
ity’s mental laziness; accredited thinkers
have written reams to prove the profundity
of this work, and Europe, with little more
than a mumbled protest, has given it the
benefit of the doubt. Thus a seemingly
boundless faith in man is for a moment left
struggling against a wave of contempt for
him. These confidence-tricksters can con-
vince him !
Slowly there comes a change in our atti-
tude. Bewilderment has held us long enough ;
we proceed to discover that many of these
painters are in deadly earnest. So the emo-
tions are stirred all over again, and pity
comes uppermost—a flood of pity identical
with that we felt for the poor devil whose
lack of a sense of values landed him event-
ually in an asylum; who told us with every
sign of complete conviction that he was
Christ; that he could have the world burned
to-morrow if he wished. The presence
of an analogy is suspected, and the pursuit
of it brings us up from the fevered world of
passion into the calm world of logic. The
analogy reveals itself a truth. The extreme
modern painter has so far lost his sense of
values as to believe he possesses supreme
powers. He is convinced that he can turn
the laws of light and vision upside down,
and is making the attempt. Yet he is
merely trying to do what nearly all other
modern artists believe they can do : paint
more than visual truth. His work only pro-
duces a greater shock because he has less
patience for visual truth than the others;
consequently his visual lies are more strik-
ingly obvious. And so we come to the basic
fact which the pioneers of so-called “modern
art” have overlooked: before graphic art
can ever give anything more than visual
truth it must first master visual truth. The
modern creeds have been built on the assump-
tion that it has already done that; but one
serious attempt to record the whole truth of
a simple subject is sufficient to show that
this apparently simple task is insurmount-
able* After hours of struggling we put
down our brushes with a sigh of satisfac-
tion, convinced that our record could not
be truer. We return a day later to discover
that our apparent harmony of truth has
become comparative discord. A dozen tones
are a fraction too dark, a dozen more
too light; slight inaccuracies of form
and color are everywhere. Thus we
come to realise that the organ of
sight is an unfixed quantity, subject no
less than any other part of our physique to
the inertia which follows continued strain.
Withal it steadily becomes more and more
sensitive, moving - slowly on to a state of
perfection. But until art has produced the
perfect record, the fundamental laws of light
and vision remain unconquered; and there
will remain the need to forget all the visual
lies before the mind can become sufficiently
free to receive anything in the way of a
spiritual message.
P. L.
Metaphors and Idioms
The Society for Pure English, whatever
that may be, is said to have done a bold
deed in publishing a list of dead metaphors
for the guidance of those who write. Such
old friends as “Part and parcel,” "Beyond
the pale,” “A silver lining,” “Stemming :he
tide” and “Round pegs in square holes” are
declared to be dead ; but until Custom, which
is more influential than the Society for Pure
English, has dug the grave of Round Pegs,
they will continue to be associated with
Square Holes. Also, the dark cloud will
continue to have the silver lining it lias
always had, while “beyoud the pale” will
still 'be regarded as rather more impressive
in character than “over the fence”. or “the
dizzy limit,” For a Pure English Society
to Jinnounce the decease of certain stereo-
typed metaphors is an easy thing. A mock
interment may be solemnly arranged, but
only the will of the people can assure a
corpse for the box.
Dean Swift, nearly two centuries ago,
tried to do with his “Polite Conversation in
Three Dialogues” much the same thing that
the sticklers for “Pure English,” if you
know what that is, pretend to be attempting
to-day. Swift satirised the slangy similes,
conventional household proverbs, stereotyped
repartees, etc., that had grown familiar in
the mouths of polite society folk of non-
pedantic type. He gibed humorously at the
cheap forms of speech which in later years
moved Lord Chesterfield to scorn on account
of their popularity. His Lordship warned
his son that the use of popular idioms and
expressions was shockingly vulgar. But the
forms of" speech which Swift satirised nearly
two centuries ago are still in vogue, and
some of the abominations of easy discourse
which offended Chesterfield’s nice literary
sense in 1750 will outlive the memory of that
fine gentleman.
Metaphors of the sort which many uni-
versity professors object to on account of
their popularity will continue to be bred in
the bone of successive generations, even as
religious dogmas and notions of Heaven are
bred. Some of those metaphors are in the
nature of eternal verities, like the familiar
witticisms that Dean Swift sneered at. Their
philosophy is for all the ages. Their apt-
ness in application loses none of its pungency.
Would the Pure English Society ask us to
bury all the classical and Biblical quota-
tions, and forget that there are sermons in
stones and sweetness in the uses of adver-
sity? Are wo to close our mouths and steel
our pens against forcible aphorisms and
maxims simply because of their well-deserved
popularity? There is pure snobbery, as well
as pure English, in the heart of a society
for turning up one’s nose at a language’s
dear old friends. Highbrows in this case
look very like those patrons of literature who
rave together over their discovery of a cer-
tain book until everybody has grown familiar
with it, and then consider it vulgarised by
common public esteem. These famous meta-
phors are for all time. On their merits they
are immortal, and no sneers of literary swank
can do them lasting harm.

Psychology and Science
“8.C.F.” discusses some relationships:—
“C. McL.’s” naive remark (R.P. 28/6/’23), “A
pseudo-science is su<h a thing as philosophy or psy-
chology,” is delightfully original: unfortunately,
from one aspect, it is untrue. One would gather
from the extract cited that Philosophy and her
hand-maiden Psychology are to be regarded as exist-
ing on a much lower plane than “such a thing as
biology.” “C. McL.” chooses to ignore the fact that
without philosophy all the merely empirical sciences
—physics, biology, physiology and the rest —would
have and could have no basis in reality. Isaac New-
ton, the greatest natural scientist who has yet ap-
peared, had to admit that all hisi wonderful re-
search into Nature’s mechanism and its laws presup-
posed for its validity a deus ex machina who made
the existence, or, what comes to the same thing, the
functioning, of the ordered universe and its content
possible. Natural philosophy—“C. McL.’s” true
science—can afford to take Reality for granted: the
business of philosophy is to find out what that
Reality is. Thus, in the last resort, the empirical,
demonstrable sciences depend for their ultimate veri-
fication on the “pseudo-science,” philosophy. Philo-
sophy is certainly not a science; no one ever imag-
ined that it was; but it is something a great deal
more sublime.
It is instructive to notice “C. McL.’s” veneration
for the discredited ravings of the old sceptic David
Hume —“that terrible Hume,” who says “there is
no I, no Ego, no psyche, no soul.” Now, Hume
averred that the only reality in this world was an
ever-changing stream of sensations of particular states
of consciousness. There are tw»o glaring fallacies in
this assertion. In the first place a mere succession
of isolated sensations can by no means account for
the human consciousness of the succession. “C.
McL.” tells us that modern mental science cannot
“explain consciousness.” The logical conclusion of
Hume’s hypothesis is that there is no consciousness
at all. Secondly, if our life consists only of an
unconnected, inexplicable chain of sensory experi-
ences, how are we to get outside ourselves to the
objective world which gives the natural sciences their
field of inquiry ? “C. McL.” cannot logically laud
Hume and biology at the same time. The sceptic,
like the policeman in Hades, is inconsistent with
his environment. Hume contradicts himself at one
stage by observing that “there is no single pheno-
menon which we could foresee without the help of
Memory.” But Memory is a thought-process—one of
those things “C. McL.” would have us believe psy-
chology “cannot prove just now” —-and in Hume’s
world we do not think, we only feel. Thought, of
course, is the mere hunting-ground of the other
“pseudo-science” of psychology; it does not possess
the objective validity of the elements of chemistry
or the metamorphoses of physics.
Psychology is a positive science, the study of men-
tal life and human motives. “You cannot prove an
alleged fact of psychology as you can prove a fact
of biology, by showing it to anyone who cares to
look,” simply because psychology is the scientific
standpoint of the rational being towards himself,
whereas biology is his standpoint towards the material
which touches and encases him. But you can con-
vince a man of the facts of psychical science by
teaching him how to “go into his own mind and see
what he may find there.” “C. McL.” has himself
used psychology in this way, with the result, appa-
rently, that he has found a species of irrational and
unnecessary scepticism. I think it is Sir Frederick
Pollock who makes the very true observation that
every philosophy that is worth while springs from
pessimism. “C. McL.” may laugh at himself a few
years hence.
A Satchel of Books
My Father and I, by Alice Hughes (Thornton
But ter worth). It is impossible, and would be cruel,
to criticise this book. Pius /Eneas set such a stan-
dard of filial piety that no-one except Miss Hugiies
has over equalled it; but if one wishes to read
stories about the members of the aristocracy who
sat to Edward Hughes, the artist, for their por-
traits, or exposed their beauty to the camera of
Miss Hughes, the daughter-—then read it and observe
its wonderful pictures! But don’t expect to find
it anything like Boswell’s “Johnson.”
Beyond the Citn Gates, by Jack Moses (Austral
Publishing Cp., Sydney). Moses’s business has moved
him round Australia a good deal; for years he
has been taking stock of the out-back folk, whom
he loves, and has been telling yarns and listening
to yarns all the time. Now he has made a book
about them and sandwiched in some verse scribbled
at odd moments. The prose is mostly sketches and
stories of the road and the show-ground, and, though
at times brevity would have helped him to get
his point home better, still he has turned out a
ehucklesome volume of people and places true to type.
As a versifier, Moses is not in the running for the
laureateship, but he strikes occasional engaging notes
of sincerity and fun. And then he reprints Lis
epic of the Dog and the Tucker-box. The West will
count the book worth while for that classic alone.
The Inky Way
“Lip”: Somebody benefited by the banning of
Boccaccio, anyway. A bookseller in a more or less
swanky Sydney suburb, whose customers are mostly
middle-aged ladies of the occupation described in
electoral lists as “domestic duties,” tells me that
three copies of the “Decameron” which had been
hanging fire for over a year were snapped up within
24 hours. The night the announcement of the pro-
hibition appeared in the press a customer, who had
hitherto displayed only Florence Barclay tendencies,
called and paid 7s. 6d., deposit on a 30s. edition,
and collected the volume next day. It makes one
think that booksellers are in general missing a lot
of chances by neglecting to keep active press-agents
on their premises. The theatres and “pitcher” shows
beat them hollow in that respect.
“Pedro”: A little book of notes on “Great Expec-
tations,” issued by N.S.W. Education Department
for the guidance of pupils, contains the statement
that nowhere in his [Dickens’s] pages do we find
the portrait of a real aristocrat. True, Dickens was as
a stranger in a strange land when he floundered in
among the nobility, and,; as Anthony Trollope said,
his lords and ladies all walked on stilts. But his
facility in that delighting art of plausible exaggera-
tion which we call caricature was not paralysed in
the presence of the very gilt-edged ones. Proof of this
is in “Bleak House.” If Sir Leicester Dedlock, Bart,
(as Bucket addressed him), isn’t a portrait of a real
aristocrat, and so like as to appeal to all who have
rset the type, where in English fiction is there such a
portrait ?
“H.K.”: Lower George-street. Sydney, The Bul-
letin’s nowaday location, heard the clank of formes
over a centilry ago. Somewhere hereabouts was
George Howe’s printery, whence, on November 3,
1803, there issued the first Sydney Gazette. The
New South Wales Magazine came into existence in
the vicinity on August 1, 1833. The sole proprietor
was the Rev. Ralph Mansfield; he became editor of
the Gazette after Robert Howe was drowned in 1824,
and was afterwards editor of the Herald. The office
of the last sheet, which began its career on April 18,
1831, faced Essex-street. In 1856, however, the
Herald shook the dust of Lower George-street from
its feet and migrated to its present position in
Hunter-street, where the proprietor, Mr. Fairfax, had
erected for the paper “a huge stone fabric in Italian
style, at a cost of £30,000.”

LTHOUGH it may seem a far cry from the motorist on
the open road or in the city street, to the rows of careful
workmen standing in aisles of oil-dripping drills or bending
rhythmically to the fall of great hammers in a forge, there
is a close relation.
For every shock of the road that is smothered in absorbent
steel For every sudden pitch or hairpin turn negotiated
with surest safety For ten thousand miles of untroubled
travels, piled on ten thousand more
A light has burned in the night at the desk of some en-
gineer seeking the solution of his problem. Every enjoy-
ment of a fine result springs from the deliberate creation of an equal quality.
This is the light by which the Packard Car has been built from the day the design of the first Packard took
shape upon the drawing board. There has been a constant growth of Packard standards, envisioning always
a finer and finer result; and for the achievement of these standards, an increase and improvement of facili-
ties nothing short of spectacular.
From the one-cylinder Packard of a generation past to those marvels of engineering design and manufac-
turing accuracy that bear the Packard name to-day, the progress of Packard standards and Packard methods
has been an uninterrupted march, step by step, step by step.
In the New Single Six Packard has combined all its traditional features and more, to produce a car which
is undoubtedly aristocratic in construction, in appearance and in performance, but which sells at an agree-
ably moderate price.

Sometimes I should be glad to go again
To childlike faith, to look up hushed and
say,
When its bright colors flamed after the rain,
“Oh, the great Bow of God”; and when
the day,
The blue, sweet day, melted into the dim
Green hues of even, wherein glimmered
white
The first faint stars, and silver grew the slim
Young moon, "Look, Heaven’s lanterns are
alight!”
With caught breath very softly I should go
(Tfead silently where half-forgotten sway
The tall trees of lost years, whose falling
slow
Red leaves be memories), a still green way,
A winding way of dreams, and I should hear
Amid the ghostly trees old laughter ring
Liltingly by me, and at last win clear
In the dawn twilight of a vanished Spring.
Let the soft twilight tinged with glimmering
gold
Lighten about stretched hands and loosened
hair,
While an enchanted sea of wonder rolled
Beneath the shadowed wood and the sweet
air
Thrilled as with windy flutes, and passionate
blue
Flowered the very dawn from petals
furled.
For eager-eyed again I should gaze through
Rose mists of lost illusions on the world.

Necropolis.
In these broad acres Death has laid away
All that was mortal of our loved and lost;
Reckless of tears and plaints and human
cost,
Here he has stored 'his harvest of filched
clay.
Poor useless wreckage of the hard-fought
fray,
Poor empty shells impatient Time has
tossed
Aside. What matter these? The souls
have crossed
Tlie darksome void into the radiant day.
In this chill place, where carrion comes
again
Through cleansing mercy of our mother
Earth
To beauty of grass and flower and leaf and
t^e,
Are but the fading footprints of the men
And women who have passed beyond this
dearth
To the long banquet of Eternity.

If Death should come when I am worn and
old,
With whisperings of peace, and tongue of
gold,
And gently smooth my tired lids, and say:
‘ Now come ! Your feet have trod their des-
tined way!”
Yet though my bones were stiff with dread
disease,
And slow the blood in withered arteries,
I’d laugh and cry: “Ah, see, upon the hill,
The laden winds blow scented tassels still;
At dawn and eve the thrush’s speckled throat
Pours on the air its lovely, liquid note:
Still weep the clouds and shining raindrops
gem
The spider’s filmy web, and fragile stem.
Oh, Death, you hold no joys to tempt the
mind
Dearer than these earth-loves I’ll leave
behind!”
And head up-flung I’d scorn his eyes, and
so,
Beating my fists against his face, I’d go!

Refuge.
I have made me a house for my dreams
Where the waters of fantasy flow ;
From the moon-pool of slumber that gleams
Like a gold-misted shadow on snow.
I have made me a house of delight
Where the glens of forgetfulness are,
Andthe nebulous splendor of night
Whorls over it, star beyond star.
Till a dawn that the world never knows,
Like a hyaline phantom of fire,
Shall waken each tremulous rose
With the pulse of light’s seven-stringed
lyre;
Till a morning, ghost-kissed by the breeze,
Comes laughing with youth in her eyes,
O’er the shadow of chrysolite seas
And the flame of chameleon skies!
Till the marvellous dawn that is Death
Breaks over it, fire within fire,
Night circles it, sweet with the breath
Of the beauty all dreamers desire,
And at gates of the garden of pain
That blossoms about it, red glows
Through the poppy pale moon’s yellow rain
Grief’s crimson and terrible rose.
There are chambers storm-liued and bizarre
As a sunset of jacinth and jade—
Some pale as a pearl or a star,
Some bright as a scimitar blade;
The sob of the sea is in some,
Some are glad with the music of birds;
But the holy of holies is dumb
With a loveliness deeper than words.
Ah! we dreamers, we dream or we die
To the glory whose glamor we know ;
And the visionless world, with its sky
Of drab shadows, alas is our foe!
Where the moon-pool of fantasy gleams
Far-off from life’s infinite wrong.
We have made us a house for our dreams
In the exquisite heart of a song.

THE WEAKEST FEDERATION
IN THE WORLD.
That was the description which a Vic-
torian Judge applied not long ago to the
Australian Constitution, and his Honor
spake less through his hat than as one
inspired. The Constitution is weak, and
its weakness apparently attracts weak men
to Federal office. If the present Cabinet is
left out of consideration as being still on
trial, there hasn’t been a strong Ministry
since that of Deakin in 1910, and I)e a kin’s
strength lay only in his honesty and in his
devotion to his country’s interests. Since
his day there have been lazy men, and color-
less men, and men who tried to pass off the
uncertain mind for the judicial mind, and
pretended to be thinking when they were
merely hesitating. The Constitution was
born under disadvantages, inasmuch as N. S.
Wales, the most populous State, and the
one from which the Federal impulse nomi-
nally came, sent only three sincere and
ardent Federalists to the Convention. The
other seven were either indifferent or hos-
tile, and anxious for the weakest possible
constitution as the next best thing to no
constitution at all. (George Reid, who
turned Federalist to block Parkes’s attempt
to come back on the Federal issue, and lost
all interest with the patriarch’s death, be-
longed to either sub-party—or both.) There
was too much tendency to follow the United
States model as the easiest of imitation, and
likewise not enough tendency, for some of the
worst points were adopted while some of
the best ones were not. Thus the Federal
capital came to be disfranchised, which is
a U.S. freak, and for a long time one-sixth
of the continent was disfranchised also, and
deprived even of local government, which
wasn’t any U.S. freak, but a local one. A
particularly bad U.S. precedent was followed
by enumerating the powers of the Common-
wealth, and leaving to the States everything
else, including matters that had been over-
looked, new matters that had not been fore-
seen, and the benefit of the doubt. But the
U.S. ideas by which the waste lands of the
States became Federal territory, and by
which the Cabinet is chosen from the multi-
tude outside Parliament instead of from the
few' inside, were missed.
* * * *
The list of things which the Australian
Commonwealth may not do sounds like the
list of forbidden degrees, which alleges,
among other points, that it is not good form
for a man to marry his grandmother. That
it has no power to make new States by cut-
ting up overgrown old ones is well known.
The U.S. Congress has made 35 new States,
and populations have swarmed into them,
and cities have sprung up, while Australia
hasn’t one to its credit. Even though great
areas of the continent under its control are
being depopulated of Federal taxpayers by
the parochial devices of State politicians,
the Australian Commonwealth has no right
to interfere. If the whole great country
was being depopulated it would still have no
legal right to interfere, except as regards the
N. Territory and Canberra. On over
2,450,000 sq. miles of its own soil it can’t
build a mile of railway save by the permis-
sion of a State authority, and then, of course,
only w’here and on what conditions the State
permits. As a natural corollary, Federated
Australia can’t open and develop a single
one of its own closed ports (save, of course,
on the narrow N.T. coastal strip), so that
it may raise a healthy crop of Federal tax-
payers and collect Customs revenue there.
Even if invasion looms on the near horizon
the central alleged authority is not empowered
to build the most urgently essential strategic
railway on any part of the 2,450,000 sq.
miles which are under State control if some
State concerned says no, though it may “con-
trol” the existing tangle of mixed gauges
“with respect to transport for the naval and
military purposes of the Commonwealth.”
It has no authority to supply the country
it is supposed to govern with a uniform
gauge, no matter how much it may be re-
quired for defence purposes. It can’t dele-
gate railway-construction rights to Private
Enterprise where it has none of its own, and
Private Enterprise can’t act on its own.
* * * *
Under Clause 119 the Commonwealth is
in a position to protect every State against
invasion, and “on the application of the
Executive Government of the State, against
domestic violence.” Should the Executive
Government be coerced and terrorised into
silence, or should it belong to a party
well known in Australia which is affiliated
Avith the Red International at Moscow, and,
therefore, be the real cause of the domestic
violence (in which case it Avould also be
silent), there is a doubt whether the High
Court, or even a jury, would decide that the
Commonwealth could legally do anything.
This would be annoying if the domestic vio-
lence amounted to massacre of anti-Bolshevik
citizens, practical secession and practical an-
nexation. And it might be complicated and
made more violent by what Avas practically
though not technically invasion. That is
to say, foreign and “international” friends
might arrive in droves after domestic violence
had crippled authority, or even earlier, not
as the soldiers of some country which had
declared Avar, but as travellers who had
dropped in. If it proved, as is possible, that
the Federal authority could only move when
the N. Territory or Papua broke out, or
when the tide of blood Avashed up against
the steps of its throne at Canberra, the
situation would he interesting from a legal
standpoint. It might almost call for the
appointment of a Royal Commission.
A matter of at least equal importance is
that the Commonwealth has no visible right
mentioned in the Constitution to prevent its
OAA r n country going recklessly or w’ilfully and
maliciously insolvent. The country may not
go broke in one piece, but if it goes broke in
six pieces it will be just as broke.
Roughly speaking the Commonwealth owes
£412,000,000 and the States Avhich compose
the Commonwealth owe £550,000,000. With-
out increasing the pace they ought to owe
£1,000,000,000 in another dozen years, and
£1,500,000,000 in another 24 years, by which
time the Federal debt may be paid off. The
futile Constitution gives the Australian Gov-
ernment no power to prevent its subjects be-
ing pawned to that extent, or any other
extent. The Red or Communist policy Avhich
Labor has adopted provides absolutely for
repudiation of public and private debts.
Even if the matter had not been set forth in
plain Avords it is impossible to nationalise
“the means of production, distribution and
exchange” without repudiation. In short, it
is in the power of State cranks to pull doAvn
all Australia’s financial institutions, and to
bring the warships of foreign Powers potter-
ing about these shores by way of “bringing-
pressure to bear” (on the Commonwealth, of
course), and the Constitution makes no pro-
vision for such an obvious emergency. Parts
of Commonwealths have defaulted before
now for a paltry million or two, but a Com-
monwealth where one or two parts are big
enough and indebted enough to pull down the
whole shoAV is this country’s special curiosity.
* *:«• * *
The Constitution is bad enough, even leav-
ing out minor details, to justify what his
Honor of Victoria said about it. Yet a good
deal might be done, even with the unpromis-
ing materials available, by a strong Prime
Minister with a passion to exalt the Federal
status and dignity. Unfortunately the record
of seven successive Cabinets is that Fisher
was a colorless and uninspired stodge; that
Cook was a dull anti-Federalist, and the sort
of local man who rises by the hackneyed
method of being a trade-union secretary;
and that Hughes was an old-type anti-
Federalist, also of the trade-union secretary
brand. The Federal power has a fine pro-
perty of its own which it could develop and
settle, and in which it Cofild do necessary
railway building without askihg any State’s
consent. And there is no legal impediment
if it choke to make provision against a finan-
cial crash by creating a Federal sinking fund
against the State debts. It has reason, as
the crash would be its own affair in the long-
run, for the nominally supreme Govern-
ment must either pay the foreign bill
or fight the foreign creditor, or abdicate
its sovereignty and abandon the defaulting
State to the creditor, and tell him to recoup
himself by a process of “squeeze.” It is dif-
ficult to imagine any more subtle way of
extending the Federal power over the States
than for the Federal authority to thus be-
come a heavy father to the State debts,
especially as it -would thereby turn the flank
of the revolutionary gang, which looks for-
ward to national bankruptcy as a means to-
wards the disintegration of society. But a
Federal Government with a healthy ambition
for adventure is very long in coming.
ANTI-FRENCH PROPAGANDA.
A Sydney journal which once trounced the
Hun as mercilessly as any announced a few
days ago that it “had engaged Dr. Ludwig
Stein for regular articles on public ques-
tions in Europe.” There was a certain dis-
ingenuousness in the editor’s presentation of
his new contributor :
Dr. Stein's personality is in no way disguised.
He is a former Swiss professor of high international
. reputation, who now: occupies an important position
in Berlin journalism. Such a man may be quite
readily acquitted of unreasoning- prejudice or dis-
honest advocacy.
Stein, who is a native of Hungary and a
Prussian journalist of some 30 years’
standing, ranked with Feiler, of the
frankfurter Zeitung, and Naumann, who
contributed largely to the Vossische
Zeitung (with which Stein was also asso-
ciated), as an intemperate slanderer of Eng-
land throughout the war. London Times re-
printed seme of his less offensive views as
an indication of the trend of extremist
opinion in Germany, and the Hearst papers
used to feature his more violent attacks on
Britain’s policies and fighters until the
U.S.A. came into the war. Stein wheedles
now where he used to hector and threaten.
But his patriotic aim is the same—to win
the war for Germany on enemy territory.
The new German manner—the one which
a disciplined people has substituted for the
swashbuckling old references to “blows on
England’s dirty snout from the ironclad fist
of the good German Michael” —was exem-
plified in an article which a big daily pub-
lished a day or so after the announcement
that Stein was to be given a chance to aid
the Fatherland in Australia. It was by a
German woman-doctor. In a key as persis-
tently minor as that of any funeral march
she held forth about the wicked French:—
What nobody in France knows nor will know till
there is a change in public affairs is that we have
paid millions and millions of francs for building lip
their devastated areas, and that all that money has
been spent upon the French army, and that not a
penny has been given to this poor country. Our
“reparations” have only gone to keeping up these
soldiers, who murder our people in the Ruhr. W'e
have done everything lhat was possible to make
things all right again.
Stinnes, it appears, is a philanthropist:—
His workmen like him, and I think they would
not if he really cheated his country. I can’t believe
that those people ( i.e commercial magnates) could
cheat for money when the knife' is at the throat of
their country. Stinnes is said to be quite a plain
man, without any inclination for luxury. Poor
Knurr!
The Germans, who were the first to dis-
cover what could be done with the “herd
mind,” know that this maudlin bunkum, if
forced on the attention of our people with
resolution, must have the effect of causing
thousands to hate France even though
memory should debar them from loving Ger-
many. But is it either politic or right that
we should turn on our proven friends at the
behest of enemies who would have utterly
destroyed us once, and who would do so to-
morrow if the opportunity offered?
* * * #
Let the truth first be understood as re-
gards the new movement —that its inspira-
tion is Big Business. Communist leaders
preach internationalism, but the only places
where the thing is to be found in perfect
working order are the offices of the great
shipping,. food, oil and other combines. It
is in their immediate interests (as, indeed,
it is in the immediate interests of all of us)
that Germany should be put on her feet
again. But Big Business, which in Germany
was all for war nine years ago, never has
been far-sighted. The captains of industry of
the last half-century have failed consistently
to read nations’ minds aright; to properly
estimate the latter’s courage and determina-
tion ; to look beyond the period inside which
a fortune may be made—say, a decade or
two. In these respects the war party in
South Africa 25 years ago may fairly be
compared with .the German war party of
1914. The present drive against France, if
successful, may enable certain people to
make money in the coming 10 or 20 years.
But two vital questions remain to be an-
swered
1. Is there the remotest possibility that France
can be sermonised out of the Ruhr by Germans, or
Germans camouflaged as Swiss, writing in British
papers ?
2. Would it, in any event, be in our interests or
in the interests of civilisation in the long run if
the French were to forego their grip on Germany?
* * * *
The French are proverbially logical, and
their geographical situation has made them
close students of modern European history.
When they are told that they will never be
ftble to keep a virile people like the Germans
in permanent subjection, they laugh. They
know that the world is strewn with virile
people whose ancestors were effectively sub-
dued. The Dutch defeated Spain in the
latter’s heyday, and drove the British Navy
out of the Channel. Their race is still brave
and mentally vigorous, yet Holland has been
rendered nationally negligible. The French
have only to read the story of Prussia to
be convinced that starkness is one of the
chief secrets of national greatness. Prussia
rose by violence under Frederick the Great.
Its decline began with the treaty of Reichen-
bach four years after his death—an agree-
ment which yvas based on equity and modera-
tion, but which brought the German kingdom
into contempt and lost it the vassalage of
Poland, Sweden and Turkey. Prussia was
virtually pushed aside when the third par-
tition of Poland took place ifi 1795 (Russia
taking 2000 square Miles and Austria 1000
to Prussia’s 700) ; and after being treated
from Austerlitz Onwards as a vassal State by
Napoleon it was humiliated to the earth and
robbed of all its former gains by the treaty
of Tilsit. Von Mot.tke, the Foch of his
day, laid the foundations of the German
Empire at Koniggratz, and he and Bismarck
completed the edifice five years later at Ver-
sailles. lhat the structure was overthrown
in 1918 afforded no proof that force did not
pay: all it proved was that the Allies had
been able to mobilise greater torce and sup-
erior military genius. Such is the French
reasoning, and who can question its sound-
ness ? As to the capacity of the French
to impose their will on Germany, or any
other European country, it need only be said
that in modern weapons and equipment
and in personnel the French army stands
where _it did at the Armistice, while
its flying arm is immeasurably stronger.
What is the use of preaching forbearance,
charity and the rest of the Sabbath-school
virtues to a people so situated; a people who
have been taught by Germany itself that
national prestige, wealth and security from
invasion depend on the iron hand?
By offering- the hospitality of our news-
papers to professional German propagan-
dists, with the object of discrediting the
French, we will win neither the affection nor
the respect of the Germans. They still want
what they went to war for in 1914 —those
places in the sun -which we hold—-and they
still hate us for possessing them. On the
other hand the news that persons of the
Stein type are maligning France here—
albeit in a vastly different tone from the one
they employed in Berlin during the war-
will certainly lose us the friendship of thou-
sands of Frenchmen who at present look on
us as comrades. If the cause were good, in
the national sense, that loss might be borne;
but when the long view—the view that Big
Business scorns—is taken, it appears that
the backing of Germany as against France is,
Imperially, suicidal. There is ample room in
the world for a strong France and a strong
Britain: there is none for a strong Germany
and a strong Britain. Germany colonises;
so do we. Germany is a shipping power;
so are we. Germany’s manufactures enter
into competition with ours, and her commer-
cial houses exploit the same trade territories.
It is in Australia’s interest as a unit of the
British Empire that the Germans should go
the way of their relatives, the Dutch, and if
we could get over our racial habit of hypoc-
risy we might openly display gratitude to the
French for their readiness to apply the neces-
sary motive force. But, anyhow, it is un-
seemly that we should let those who are still
our enemies use Australia’s press artillery
to put down a series of barrages on those
who are still our friends. Decency should
forbid such a thing, if statesmanship did not
enter into the question.
RECENT DISCOVERIES IN AMERICA.
Tommy Walker, Labor M.L.A. for Kanowna
(W.A.), and Labor Cabinet Minister from
1911 to 1916, went to the U.S.A. a few
months ago to dig up evidence in favor of
Prohibition, being a recent convert to that
cause. There was a time in Tommy’s tribu-
nate when Kanowna had the melancholy dis-
tinction of being the most over-pubbed town-
ship in Westralia, but Mr. and Airs. Tickle-
brain have mostly left the scene of revelry
now that the gold has given out (some of
them got jobs in the State Hotels Depart-
ment), and their old member has seen the
Light. Tommy found America amazingly
prosperous:—
Enough labor cannot be secured to do the work
that waits to be done. There is ’even difficult} 7 in
getting- enough men to enter the navy and army to
keep those services up to their usual standard;
better wages can be secured outside. The post office
are glutted throughout the country for wangKf
labor. At Peoria, Illinois, I found that one ' . the
local steelworks was seven months behind In its
orders because it could not obtain employees to keep
pace with the demand.
The returned wanderer asserts that Pro-
hibition is “an important factor” in this
flourishing state of affairs. He allows, how-
ever, that there are “other causes.” This
is sufficiently evident, for New York, the
most populous State in the Union, is not
exempt from the general prosperity, although
it is in full revolt against compulsory absti-
nence, as Mr. Walker admits—in New
York City “I could have been drunk every
day of my life had I liked.” There, the Gov-
ernor being an anti-Prohibitionist, and the
State Legislature having repealed the Vol-
stead Enforcement Act, clubs have sprung-
up to which admission is by ticket. “There
is no difficulty in obtaining tickets,” says
the gentleman from Kanowna, “and, once
admitted, you can get as much alcohol as
you desire.”
* • * *
From the identical city where you can
get as much alcohol as you desire it was
cabled last week that bricklayers are de-
manding, and presumably receiving, from
14 to 18 dollars a day. A related fact im-
pressed the traveller from Westralia:—
All over America are enormous factories, outside
which all day long you will see motors parked. On
inquiry I found that these motors belonged to the
employees, who went to and from their work in their
own automobiles. How many Australian workers
could do that?
This automobile habit, the Labor M.L.A.
explains, is “made possible by teetotalism.”
But the car-owning wage-earner arrived in
the U.S.A. long before the Volstead law, as
hundreds of Australians with American ex-
perience can testify. If he hasn’t been
noticed in the Commonwealth to any extent
it certainly isn’t because the Australian
workers, considered in the mass, are exces-
sive drinkers. Drunkenness is not their be-
setting sin. Before the war, according to
Knibbs’s ' statistics, the Australians con-
sumed a trifle less wine, 50 p.c. less ardent
spirits and 30 p.c. less beer than the
Americans. The quantities illicitly manufac-
tured and drunk (enormous in the Republic,
negligible in the Commonwealth) were not,
of course, taken into account. Since those
days, without Prohibition, Australia has con-
trived ro steadily reduce its consumption of
alcohol per head, and convictions for drun-
kenness per 10,000 of population dropped
one-third in five years. It is now suggested
that America has become the more abstemi-
ous nation as a consequence of adopting a
“prohibitive” system, the ineffectiveness of
which has become a world’s joke, and under
which home brewing and distillation are
legal. l Human nature being what it is, the
thing is highly improbable, to say the least.
Anyhow, the evidence is unconvincing.
Motor-cars are a lot cheaper in America
than in Australia, and so are spares and
petrol. That does more to explain the auto-
mobiling factory-hand than a cloistered and


sheltered virtue, which he probably doesn’t
practise; but it is only part of the story and
not the most important part. There are
“other causes”—root causes, in fact. One
is that the enormous factories which Mr.
Walker saw all over America are protected
by an adequate tariff. They are never put
out of action by the dumped produce of
foreign countries, as the carbide industry has
been put out of action in Tasmania. Unlike
many Australian Labor leaders, especially of
the imported variety, the U.S. unionists who
park their motor-cars outside the factory are
solid for High Protection. And they don’t
believe in neutralising its advantages by
huge foreign loans, which inevitably mean
huge imports of manufactured goods. Their
country went out of the foreign-borrowing
business early in its career, and has never
gone back to it. Also, they have no use for
the go-slow superstition or the crazy things
that grow out of it. Being piece-workers for
the most part, they can see through the
idiotic contention that the workers gain,
individually and collectively, by loafing on
the job. It is never alleged in their Parlia-
ments, as it is co:. tantly alleged in ours,
that millions have been wasted in the con-
struction by day-labor of Government rail-
ways and silos, or that Government brick-
layers are laying 200 bricks a day where they
used to lay a thousand, or that, the learning
of trades being systematically discouraged,,
only one bricklayer’s apprentice can be fohnd
in towns the size of Hobart and Bathurst.
'At * * *
The last accusation would knock the aver-
age native-born American worker all of a
heap. One of his proudest boasts is that he
is a.skilled man. The unskilled work of his
country he leaves to the nigger and the C 3
immigrant from Central Europe, knowing
that their wages are never more than a half,
and rarely more than a third, of his own. He
would probably do something drastic were it
proposed, as a matter of policy, to pay the
coolie as much as the mechanic—starting
with the supposition that every coolie of 21
ov/ns a wife and two children —and this by
the expenditure of numerous borrowed mil-
lions on political dirt-jobs constructed on the
day-labor plan, some of the losses on which
would be chargeable against his income and
that of the factory to which he now drives
in his motor-car. His experience during the
war gave him a distaste for State Socialism.
And he has nothing but contempt for the
madder sort of Socialism now raging in
Russia and recommended for adoption in
Australia—with violence, by Trades Union
Congresses; in constitutional doses, by the
A.L.P. His General Federation of Labor
annually repudiates the abominable thing.
For this it is ferociously denounced, by Aus-
tralian Labor newspapers, and he himself
is characterised as a downtrodden serf. But
a Labor M.L.A. assures us that his country
is a hive of industry, and that he drives to
work in his own car, whereas it stands re-
corded by a Labor M.11.R. (the thing appears
in Hansard, June 21, p. 264) that “Austra-
lia has 5,500,000 people, half of whom are
starving—on the bread-line, at any rate.”
There must be something in American
methods, after all.
AFTER THE COMMUNE.
It is interesting to speculate as to what is
north of the North Pole, and what is blow-
ing behind the wind, and what will succeed
eternity when eternity is finished. It is also
a matter of speculation what will happen
after the Australian Communists (or, rather,
the imported Communists in Australia, by
whom local Labor has been captured) have
had their little Commune. It appears to be
assumed on all sides that that will be a
definite end —an end of some sort. I think
it will he only a wayside happening, and
hardly even a stopping-place.
The programme, as mapped out, is simple,
but it suggests a map of the world with the
globe left out. According to the plan, Labor
(now Communist Labor) is to attain control
of both Houses, as it has done before. Lenin
and Trotsky used violence because they had
soldiers and hadn’t any show at all of a
Parliamentary majority, but Australia’s
Lenin-Trotskys, having a Parliamentary
majority for the moment hut no soldiers until
they achieve office, will act differently. Being-
in control the natural idea will be to buttress
themselves with more troops, to do things with
the franchise that will make the position per-
manent, and then get on with the programme.
As published the other day, it includes the
confiscation to the Ideal State of lands, build-
ings, factories, shops, warehouses, mines,
ships, financial undertakings (banks, insur-
ance offices, etc.) and businesses of all sorts,
the repudiation of all debts, public and pri-
vate, and the “organisation” of the dangerous
educated people who know how to manage
things—their organisation into gangs for
labor at “urgent tasks,” such as making bricks
without straw.
I don’t really see why the programme
shouldn’t be carried out if the operators make
the best of their short time. At least, I don’t
know that anything is being done to avert
it. And after all this motion, it may be
found that things are only beginning to com-
mence to get a move on.
Britain’s losses in this brisk mix-up (in-
cluding Federal, State and municipal secu-
rities, banks, insurance offices, warehouses,
merchandise, buildings, lands, shares, mort-
gages, ships and sundries which it owns
here) would be about a thousand million
pounds. The first remark of John Bull
on hearing the news would probably
be that never in all history was such a moun-
tain of steal attempted by such a passionate
little ant or cocksparrow of a community.
Then he would get busy. The Old Man in
London has put up in hate and bitterness
with a lot from Soviet Russia, but
Even in its diminished condition Russia is much
bigger than Australia, and when at its worst it was
suspected of having a population of 100,000,000.
When it repudiated it had a real army of some
sort (it is now supposed to have 6,000,000 troops
on paper and 1,500,000 under arms), and it had
almost unlimited arms and ammunition, sent over
by the Allies for the use of the Czar’s forces.
The Soviet Government retreated to Moscow, which
is quite different as a defensive position from such
inland towns as Bathurst and Toowoomba. No satis-
faction could be got except by following it there, and
invaders have given up going to Moscow.
Then the Old Man lost no territory or prestige,
and very few of his own people, by the Russian
defection. It didn’t endanger Maoriland, Fiji, South
Africa or other places of importance. And the Old
Man’s hands were remarkably full just then.
But in the matter of Soviet Australia he
would probably arrive as fast as his big
ships could come to inquire about bis thou-
sand millions, to protect from the Soviet
those people of his own race who wanted to
be protected, and to make sure that some
kindly brown nation, 56,000,000 strong, didn’t
arrive on the protection stunt first, and set.
up its tent in the middle of a group of Brit-
ish possessions. He wouldn’t suspend the
Constitution, it being already gone, but he
would get on without it. There would be
no more trial by jury for a long, long time. The
principal business would be that of dealing
with Communists for inevitable disorders, and
as three jurymen would probably want to
acquit the accused right off, and the other
nine to hang him with or without evi-
dence, a court-martial system would be in-
evitable. Whether any of the British offi-
cers, being far from control and observation,
would sink into the flogging habits of their
old predecessors it is hard to say. Though
the invaders would easily, with the aid of
the friendly part of the population, domi-
nate the few big seaside resorts which are
all the real cities Australia possesses, a long
period of lawlessness would be inevitable
in much of the interior. There would be
bushranging on the part of the Commu-
nists, and the hunting of Communists with
dogs, guns, mantraps and poisoned baits, on
the part of those who had suffered by them.
The hunted would not only include local
Soviet officials and confiscators, but the vast
mass of unauthorised helpers, like Roy Gov-
ernor and Ned Kelly and others who
alw’ays take up the patriotic cause in an
amateur way when society is being recon-
structed. Some of the midnight executions,
when Communists were caught, might not
be nice. Man, when enraged, is apt to be a
cruel beast in the dark.
If by any inconceivable chance Britain cut
its losses and let the Australian Soviet alone,
there would be no longer any pretence that
the abandoned place was part of the British
Empire. So other nations would irrupt, as
a sacred duty, to protect their nationals, and
their ships, commerce and property, and to
boost, at their own price, the cause of civil-
isation. Confiscation and casual insult and
occasional violence would give abundant
excuse for big, land-hungry peoples like the
United States, France, Italy and Japan to
rush to the scene of the biggest and easiest
conquest that the world has seen since the
days of Spanish America —easier even than
Spanish America. If Britain stood out it
would simply be a matter of dividing the
carcase of an almost unarmed outlaw. A
Bolshevik State, and especially one which
is more or less indebted to everybody of im-
portance, and which has insulted everybody
who counts, has no rights save those it can
hold with the strong hand, and two persons
per sq. mile, with a civil war between them,
can’t hold much. There would necessarily
be a division, as with Poland and Africa,
for no hungry Power would let another take
the lot. The method of France with Com-
munists was acquired in 1871. It was prac-
tically that to have been an active Com-
munist meant death, and to have been a Com-
munist sympathiser was good for a long
pestilential sentence. Japanese methods arc
not known, but are strongly suspected.
United States Judges have an unpleasant
habit of giving out 50-year sentences; also,
the U.S. police are good at the “third de-
gree.” Some fairly mild pro-Huns who
were run in when Uncle Sam first joined in
the war have hardly begun to work out their
terms yet.
The Australian Commune is doomed to be
short-lived, but it may set the nation’s pros-
perity back 50 years, or it may end the
nation altogether. But if Britain should
Stand aside, and Australia thus become an
area open to selection, the Commune will
Create a heap of settlement. Even the North-
ern Territory may soon count its population
by brown millions.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Missing a Golden Opportunity.
Tiie emptiness of the country districts rela-
tively to the towns is one of Australia’s
standing scandals. The last census actually
showed that Melbourne, the Commonwealth’s
horrible example in this connection, has
765,846 inhabitants as against 764,268 in
the remainder of Victoria. Another chronic
source of concern is the emptiness of Aus-
tralia as a whole, and more especially its
northern regions. Meanwhile, the annual re-
port of General Ci-iauvel, Inspector-General
of the C.M.F., indicates that an industry
which might attract people to Australia,
which might draw them from the cities to
the country, and which is particularly suited
to Northern Australia, is on its last legs:—
The prospect of Australia again producing in ar.y
quantity the same class of horse that established
such a reputation during the late war is so doubt-
ful, and I look upon the matter as so serious, that
I feel I must invite attention to it. The remount
order for India for the year was 4000, and though
the order was divided among 13 shippers, all men
with many years’ experience of requirements, it took
many months to fulfil, and some thousands of horses
were inspected. Most of the artillery mounts were
bred in Central Australia, and those for the cavalry
in Queensland. The rejections were chiefly, I under-
stand, on account of bad conformation generally,
want of substance, and insufficient bone. It is obvious
that the standard of riding-horse is deteriorating,
and that breeders are doing little to prevent it.
The reason for the deterioration is well
understood amongst experts, and is not con-
fined to Queensland. Only last month a
deputation from Sydney R. A. Society
waited on the N. S. Wales Minister for
Agriculture to complain that “reject stal-
lions were being introduced into the State
from Victoria and elsewhere, and were a
menace to the industry.” Victoria is a
progressive State as regards horse-breeding,
inasmuch as it will take no culls from else-
where, while it examines its stallions
with exemplary care. But, like the rest
of the States, it exports all the mares that
dealers or remount officers care to buy; and
the ultimate results are little less disastrous
than if badly-blemished stallions were
allowed to travel the country. All over
Australia for the. past 30 years a jomt
process has been in operation: Indian and
other overseas buyers have been tak ng the
pick of our mares, and breeders have been
putting unsound stallions to the remaining
mares for replenishment purposes. The
war bled all the States white of high-class
equine blood, and at present the type of
horse which is vital to the efficiency of a
modern army is simply not to be got. As
an indication of the money that lurks in
the industry, it is worth noting that during
the late war Britain, which is itself eminent
as a breeding country, paid the U.S.A. over
£75,000,000 for horses and mules. There
are not many parts of the earth’s surface
which are suitable for horse-breeding; and
there is none more suitable than Central
and Northern Australia. Horses are as essen-
tial in warfare as ever they were, and most
of the world, despite the League of Nations,
is either at war or getting ready for war—
and likely to continue in that attitude in-
definitely. Australia has merely to stoop,
as it were, to pick up a highly lucrative
industry, which, as the years pass, must
expand sufficiently to absorb a considerable
population. Meanwhile, it waits on the
States which, owing to either indolence or
ineptitude, will do noth ng in a concerted
manner to check the outflow of sound mares
and discourage the use of unsound and ill-
bred sires.

A Defence Minister in Difficulties.
In a business of any importance the depart-
mental heads are chosen for their special
knowledge and experience: in our Parlia-
ments nothing really counts but a “pull.”
And so Australia has E. K. Bowden, a Par-
ramatta solicitor, without war experience,
as Minister for Defence. Senator Pearce
got on well enough before the war. lie
knew little or nothing of armies or navies;
but, then, 99 per cent, of his fellow-Parlia-
mentarians were in the same plight, and the
percentage of electors who had serv.ed in
either arm was absurdly small. PKarce’s
simple but effective plan was to blindly fol-
low the advice of his specialist advisers, naval
and military, secure in the knowledge that
he would be extremely unlucky to encounter
anyone in the House, or in his electorate,
whose ignorance of warlike affairs was less
abysmal than his own. It is the misfortune
of Mr. Bowden, and of the Bruce-Page
Government, that to-day both Houses con-
tain experts in almost every branch of war-
fare (naval and military, home and active
service), and that there are about half-a-
million adults, male and female, outside Par-
liament who have served by sea or land.
The consequence is he is repeatedly placed
in the invidious position of a jungle medi-
cine-man struggling to hold his professional
end up in an assemblage of F.R.C.S.’s. The
army system has always been liable to
attack, and always will be ; and it is most
desirable in the interests of Australian de-
fence that when attacks are unjust the
Minister should be competent to prove it.
The following is from a recent Hansard :
Mr. Mathews : I have seen dozens of courts-martial
at which the person who was being tried was not
allowed to speak.
Mr. Bowden : The prosecuting officer in a court-
martial .-is not allowed to bring evidence before the
Court jtbtil the accused has had in writing a precis
of what is to be said against him.
Mr. Mathews : That is a rule which is more hon-
ored in the breach than the observance.
The evils of the court-martial system are
many, and no paper has stressed them more
persistently than The Bulletin ; but to
suggest that those who conducted court-
martials during the war deviated from the
actual letter of the rules, as laid down in
the Manual of Military Law, is merely to
assist the,cause of reaction. The Summary
of Evidence (which is what Bowden means
by “a precis”) was not withheld, and pri-
soners were not refused permission to plead,
for the simple reason that such idiotic
actions would have caused the quashing of
the proceedings—a fact that was as well
known to most of the Diggers, after the war
had been in progress six months, as it was
to the litigious-minded Tommies. A Min-
ister of experience could have replied to the
member for Melbourne Ports on lines that
would have raised the prestige of his Gov-
ernment in the eyes of every fair-minded ex-
service man. But Bowden suffered under
the disability of being unable to do it. A
similar disability led him last week into the
tactical error of moving to place Austra-
lian flying-men under the British Army Act,
and found him obviously incapable of hand-
ling the situation when the inevitable storm
arose. There is no need for any Australian
arm to come under the Army Act in the
next war: the fact was proved to the hilt
in the last. And this out-of-date piece of
legislation, which has every indication of
being doomed in the United Kingdom, is
opposed to everything for which the A.I.F.
stood in the spiritual sense. Bowden, a
mild, suburban attorney, is unable to see a
point which is crystal-clear to “Pompey”
Elliott, a disciplinarian if ever there was
one, but at the same time a typical Aus-
tralian soldier. If the Bruce-Page Minis-
try wants to keep off the rocks in the coming
months, and at the same time give the Aus-
tralian defence system a fighting chance for
its life, it will replace the present Defence
Minister by someone who has been on active
service, and preferably in a combatant capa-
city. Should Mr. Bowden or liis friends
object, it would be sufficient to point out
that no solicitor would engage as managing
clerk one whose qualification was that he
had been a plumber.
“The Kidman Blight.”
Acres of MS. has come in on the subject of
Sid Kidman’s use or misuse of vast areas
of Australian back-country; and an attempt
has been made to give the gist of it here-
under :
“Ularara”: As Norman Ford has taken up the
gauge on behalf of Sidney Kidman, and seems to
have access to figures rcjgarding' numbers of stock,
employees, etc., on the various Kidman properties
in Western N. S. Wdles, I am sure Bulletin readers
would be very much interested to have fuller details.
He might give us the area of, say, Wanaaring and
Tinapagee; the number of stock on these properties
when Mr. Kidman purchased them and the number
of hands employed on them at that time; the number
of Kidman stock at present on them and the number
of bands at present employed. These are the only
stations with a frontage to the Paroo at present
owned by Mr. Kidman. If Mr. Ford feels disposed he
might give figures in reference to Urisino, Elsinora,
Thurlo, Berawinnia, Salisbury, Bootra, Yantara,
Yanrannia or any other of Mr. Kidman’s Western
N.S.W. properties, which would make a more credit-
able showing than Tinapagee and Wanaaring. He
might then say what he thinks of the two adjoining
properties on the Paroo, Nocoleche and Willara, as
grazing propositions in comparison with Wanaaring
and Tinapagee—'the number of stock on them and
the number of hands employed on them. After
he has done so it may not perhaps be fair to ask
him in what way “more Sidney Kidmans” would be
“of benefit to this suffering country of ours.”
“Bogan” : Wanaaring- and Tinapagee must contain
at.least 1,200,000 acres. When Kidman bought these
places a few years ago they were carrying- about
00,000 sheep as well as ,a fair numbdr of cattle,
and gave steady employment to at least 30 men,
not to mention contractors, shearers and teamsters.
At present I think thqy carry 2000 cattle and
the only men employed are a coupla of caretakers.
There isn’t even a black boy, where there were once
two blacks’ camps. In contrast, take Willa-ra and
Talyealye, which aren’t a third the area, and on an
average not as good country. At present they are
carrying over 16,000 sheep and 2000 head of
cattle. They can afford a manager, who has his
wife and family with him. When I was there lately
there were a dozen on the pay-roll. Now take
Marra, on the Darling, which adjoins Momba, of
which other correspondents write. Marra contains
about 240,000 acres. At present there are over
25,000 sheep and about 600 cattle on it. Tt
employs regularly over a dozen men, besides shearing-
labor, teamsters and contractors. Momba is many
times the size of Marra, is quite as good country,
yet doesn’t give employment to half as many people.
It is all rot about Joseph Timms having to sell
owing to the ravages of dogs and previous over-
stocking. Momba was never stocked to the same
extern; as neighboring stations, and the owners were
always in as good a position as their neighbors to
contend with the wild dogs. Timms bought this
place ,as a speculation, and, owing to the rise in price
of, sheep, made money out of it. But as he knew
nothing about sheep and his advisers knew less, he
got rid of it. I do not blame Kidman; if he can
make money in this way-—and he has —he is quite
justified in doing so. But I contend he is holding-
country and not putting it to its best use and is
preventing other people who could do better with
it from getting it. When his publicity agents hold
him up as being a national asset, they become ridi-
culous ; he only profits by other people’s misfortune,
and rich as he is—or was—for every crown he has
made he must have cost the country pounds.
And Randolph Bedford : Thargomindah is the
biggest Queensland town destroyed by the
Kidman blight, but New South Wales has its
examples in Wanaaring and Hungerford. In itself
the blanketing of many big pastoral properties is
bad; under Kidman methods the loss in employment,
the destruction of improvements, and the breeding
of dingoes and rabbits taku on exaggerated forms.
Mr. Norman Ford’s defence is specious and a mere
collection of words. He cannot answer the facts
by side-talk of the Queensland “habit of reviling the
hated capitalist,” nor make Mr. Kidman seem a
good citizen by an untruthful statement that Queens-
land “leans on the capitalist for money to ‘blew’ on
State enterprises.” The fact that there are Kid-
mans is one of the best reasons for State enterprises.
Mr. Kidman owns cattle country in. the Territory,
and in 1918 prosecuted certain bush rustlers for
cattle stealing. Evidence showed that Kidman’s
methods of grazing provided dleanskins five and six
years old. It is men like Mr. Kjidman who keep the
Territory back; it is the sheep selector who will
start it forward with the right foot. I agree
with Leslie Wrigley and “Ograth” that the Kid-
man blight is a Government job. Mr. Kidman should
be controlled rigidly by law, and if th:(re isn’t
any law rigid enough we must make some more.
The dingo toll on sheep in the Warrego is appalling-
in cost; and the Dingo Boards exist simply to pay
sealpage when a trapper applies for it. There must
be strictly enforced law to build and maintain dog-
proof fences and other improvements, and equally-
strictly enforced law insisting on dingo destruction
by all lessees and freeholders, and compulsory noti-
fication of any landholder failing in his obligation.
But the Kidman blight calls for a, little law all to
itself, and its first expression should be an intima-
tion to all bad citizens that Government lands are
leased for the breeding and maintenance of sheep
and cattle, and not of wild dogs and rabbits.
Same Old Thing.
Dear Bulletin, —The dismal habit of say-
ing and thinking and being the Same Old
Thing struck my eye in three different places
on one recent day. The first case was
naturally that of Minister Pearce explain-
ing the Bruce-Page policy for the North-
ern Territory. Nothing was said about go-
ing back to the freehold system, though
leasehold, both there and in Queensland, has
failed signally to attract settlers —in fact,
the Queensland Government, ’ at latest
advices, had 8J million acres more land,
neither sold, in process of sale nor occupied
by leaseholders, than in 1915, when it took
office. Nothing was said either about the
railway, though, quite apart from the fact
that it. has been solemnly guaranteed and
payment accepted, railways are regarded
everywhere else as aids to settlement. As a
natural sequence, nothing has been said so
far about a systematic resumption of leases
along the line to make room for small farms
and new towns. But there are more pro-
visions for general leases for all time and
eternity, and for very large pastoral leases
for 42 years. These are to be stocked with
a certain number of cattle, but the cattle
are not likely to be counted very carefully.
Being utterly devoid of imagination and
the vision which sees beyond to-morrow, the
Government holds that the Territory’s future
must be bullock because its past was bul-
lock ; and if an enemy comes along between
now’ and 1965 to claim, the place on the
ground of insufficient occupation, he is to
find much the same straggling garrison of
heifers that there has always been. The
stereotyped cry for cow is grotesque, seeing-
that the Government is subsidising the ex-
port of bullock to keep the industry alive.
Our early rulers were not as good as they
should have been, but if they had been as
bad as they would have been had they fol-
lowed the evil example of their descend-
ants, the sheep leases they granted all the
way from Granville to Melbourne wouldn’t
be quite run out yet. And if the N.T.
scheme was so ordinary, no less was Act-
ing-Premier Oakes, of N.S.W., when speak-
ing his daily piece about spending more loan
money to put people on the land to raise
wheat, which has also to be gilded with a
Government guarantee. His State having
spent some £7,000,000 of loans in great
haste, and the Commonwealth a lot more,
to put people on the land, and there being
many less people there than »there were 11
years ago, Mr. Oakes is habitual enough
for anything. The Rock of Gibraltar isn’t
more hackneyed. The same day appeared
a report of how a large crop of gbod

old ways to still take Genesis literally,
waited on Lord Mayor Gilpin, of Sydney,
whose famous ride to Edmonton is remem-
bered to this day, and demanded the recon-
struction of the city’s remaining slums, even
if it cost £10,000,000 or any other sum
known to man or beast. One kindly soul
said that in one extra-terrible locality as
many as 10 families dwell in one house. It
is very bad, but when half the house space
is cut off to allow of wide, breezy streets
there will probably be 15 or 20 families in
a house, and though it may be a better
house at first it will soon degenerate. In
. most other cities the size of Sydney 30 fami-
lies in a house are common enough, simply
because the average worker can’t afford to
live far from his work. The only difference
is that Sydney is the vile and premeditated
crime, perpetrated by wicked land-jobbers
and politicians, and connived at by the
silence of futile or truckling parsons, of put-
ting a needless city of a million inhabitants
in a huge State with a population of less
than seven per square mile; while Liverpool
is the unavoidable calamity which occurs in
a small State with 649 people to the square
mile. It is not the least use professing to
chase after the slum evil, even if anybody
is sincere about . it, in a city which adds
30,000 new inhabitants and 150 new factories
to its stock in a year, and which, as shown
by accessible figures in the “Statesman’s
Year Book,” piled up more new population
between the last two censuses than all the
following well-known English towns put to-
gether :
Accrington, Ashton-under-Lyne, Barnsley, Barrow-
in-Furness, Burton-on-Trent,' Bedford, Birkenhead,
Birmingham, Blackburn, Bolton, Bradford, Bristol,
Burnley, Bury, Carlisle, Chatham, Colchester, Coven-
try, Derby, Dudley, Dover, Gateshead, Grimsby,
Halifax, Huddersfield, Ipswich, Lancaster, Leeds,
Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Northampton, Nor-
wich, Nottingham, Oldham, Salford, Preston, Roch-
dale and Wolverhampton.
That is done of fixed purpose by people who
oppose the formation of new States, or the
making available, by railway communication,
of such outlets in the old State as Jervis
Lay, Twofold Bay, Port Stephens and Goff s
Harbor, and demand that no other cities
may arise to relieve the pressure. As I
haven t heard of one Sydney parson joining
a New State or Decentralisation movement
I suppose the Church approves of a diseased
system which makes slums inevitable and
degeneration unavoidable; or at least it is
too ordinary, and too much the same, and too
dashed similar to get out of its rut and dis-
approve. I don’t know whether the Austra-
lian’s painful and invariable resemblance to
himself is curable or not. —Yours, etc., Solo-
mon Malaprop.
The M.L. Citizen’s Interior.
A hen the other day a woman asked a
Maoriland jury to give an order on Saw-
bones for £IOOO because of alleged negli-
gence the answer was “No.” But a curious
rider was added- —to the effect that the
Medical Association should devise means for
stopping that sort of thing. It was a curi-
ous case. The woman had submitted to an
operation involving the Caesarian section at
the hands of defendant. Later it was found
by a prospecting party that a swab of cottou
wool had been left behind. At the hearing of
the woman’s claim for damages there was
no denial of the facts; but defendant joined
issue about the negligence, and pleaded that
the swab could be accounted for on other
grounds—that it was an accident not attri-
butable to negligent performance of work.
Of course, if anyone woke up from anaes-
thesia with a volume of the Psalms or a
sparking-plug in his interior, the circum-
stance would be good, sound prima facie evi-
dence that the operation had been carried
through in a spirit of levity. But a swab in
the case of a deep-seated operation becomes
another matter, and may be professionally
regarded in the frame of mind in which a
Supreme Court Judge is entitled to contem-
plate a reminder from the Full Court that
his Honor had overlooked an essential point
of law in Brag v. Snag. Nevertheless, some-
one ought to remind Maoriland surgeons that,
while this jury took a certain view of a par-
ticular case, the next jury may hold quite
a different view. The whole position with
regard to major operations in Maoriland is
unsatisfactory. Each of the hundreds of men
there with a medical diploma has professional
and legal license to “operate,” and operate
he does, whenever he gets a chance, over the
whole human anatomy. This is not merely
wrong. It is monstrous. A major opera-
tion is a job for a specialist, and then only
after extensive preliminaries. Maoriland, by
expanding its fine hospital system so as to
centralise the more important surgical work
in properly organised clinics, could give the
public a service which is long overdue.
Concerning Immigrants.
“ J.C.” gives his experiences :
Gilbert Mant (B. 5/7/’23) had a theory which he
tested by travelling to Australia on a Commonwealth
Liner carrying 600-odd immigrants. I, too, have a
theory, and I have been testing it for two years ; and
I would like Gilbert Mant to know of my experience
with the boys between 15 and 19 years of age who
are being absorbed by Queensland at the rate of 100
monthly. Two of those who have come under the
scheme (less than half per cent.) , have proved
absolutely unfitted for farm work. One of the two
has been returned to England as medically unfit (“not
duo to misconduct,” as they say in the Army), and
arrangements are afoot to repatriate the other, whose
trouble is deafness. About 30 have voluntarily left
the farm jobs found for them by the New Settlers’
League and State Authorities to work on other farms ;
in practically all cases the change has been to the
advantage of the lad. Less than a dozen have been
dismissed by their employers, chiefly because the em-
ployers had expected them to be experienced. They
have been placed in new positions, and are doing well.
One was arrested and charged with theft, and found
not guilty. The remainder are satisfied with their
new life and conditions, and inquiry proves equal
satisfaction on the part of their employers.
The monthly batches have taken from a week to
three weeks to dispose of, according to the number in
the batch and the seasonal conditions at the time of
arrival. Whilst awaiting emp'oyment they are housed
in the State Immigration Depot. During the whole
time the scheme has been operating one window has
been broken —whether maliciously or accidentally is
unknown —and one pillow slip has been torn in a
piFow-fight. No other damage has been done to the
building, furniture or grounds. The lads are simply
on their honor, and the only oversight given them at
THE IMPERIAL TOUCH.
“Mr. Bruce’s Government is endeavoring to bring part of the. Australian Forces under the provisions
of the British Army Act.”
THE IMPERIAL DRILL-INSTRUCTOR: “Na-h then, yer buncouth little blighter , heyes front,
neck like a swan an’ feet like a blinkin’ fairy when Hi tell yer, or yer’ll
never ’are a jigger like me an’ Captain Bruce!”
night is by .an employee of the Depth,, who is some-.,
where about 60 years of age.
And these are the type of lads Gilbert Mant. tells
us are “so beastly that the skipper threatened to
return the whole issue at Port Said” ! Perhaps
Queensland has been fortunate. Yet Queensland’s
importations are selected in the United Kingdom by
the same means as the lads for other States.
One's sympathy certainly goes out to Gilbert
Mant after his experience with Australia House. I
am quite prepared to agree with his complaint re-
garding the inefficiency of that institution, and will
join with him in hoping the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment may decide to re-organise or revolutionise the
whole outfit. But in the sacred name of Justice let
us be tolerant and fair in our criticism of the New
Settler.
e
“Country PTid” : The .Vic. Government talks
of passing an Apprentice Bill this session.
Had it encouraged an experiment started
last year by the Bendigo School of Mines
it would have something practical to work
on instead of more or less vague sug-
gestions. The supervisor of the carpentry
and joinery classes at the 8.5.. M. conceived
the notion of tendering for Education De-
partment jobs. He secured one for making
dual desks. With the union’s approval he.
engaged six competent carpenters and join-
ers at Wages Board rates and conditions,
and allotted a senior student to each. The
work went on for six months, during which
time many boys received the best sort of
tuition and advice. When time was up
the supervisor was able to hand, to the
school funds £2OO profit. Then he set out
after contracts for building agd repairing
schools. That was as far as lie got. The
Government refused his tenders,-.and he was
ordered to go on with the ordinary curricu-
lum of much theory and little practice. So
his six tradesmen lost good jobs, his boys
lost the benefit of expert teaching, and the
Government lost a fine opportunity of
cheapening its building and joinery expenses.
How like a Government!
Melbourne has become a good place for wife-
beaters, horse-beaters and criminals in general.
This is ascribed partly to jury-squaring ; yet
that affects only a small minority of cases, for
the ordinary wife-beater, horse-beater,
assault-man and rowdy doesn’t come before
a jury. The silly practice of supplying
copies of the jury panel to all and sundry
facilitates squaring, but it is an inherent
evil in the English system, which was also
that of the old Polish Parliament, by which
one hired man can block all proceedings, and
a conviction means that all 12 men are
equally marked out for vengeance, each being
equally the person who lagged Blinky Bill.
A very inadequate and ill-paid police force
(it costs less per inhabitant than any other
on the mainland) helps. In 1922 the num-
ber of crimes reported was 11,422, and the
number which remained wrapped in mystery
was 8801. Probably the police feel that it
is hardly worth while wearing out their feet
in pursuit of offenders merely that the J.P.
may discharge them without a caution or
fine them ss. The J.P., who is probably as
much afraid of the push as the juryman, is
a futile party in most cases, with modes of
reasoning of his own. A recent matter of
cruelty to animals should have been put in a
play. An indignant grocer called the atten-
tion of Policeman X. One very thin horse,
attached to a furniture van, had fallen down
in the road. It was badly shod, so that the
nails projected, and its feet were bleeding.
The other was still on its feet, but was little
more than a skeleton. Policeman X corro-
borated, and said it was one of the worst
cases in his experience. One defendant
pleaded that the first horse had been out
boarding cheaply in a paddock (with or with-
out grass), and presumably exposed to the
weather, for 18 months, which rather im-
plied that it was a chronic invalid. He
didn’t say where the second horse had been.
No. 2 defendant made two statements. One
was that the animals had been doing their
work well enough till they left off and took
to falling down. The other was that he
knew one animal had at least one cut foot,
which made it look like premeditated cruelty.
The Bench was so pleased with this frank-
ness that it discharged the pair. A small
matter, but it reflects the J.P. mind.
The well-advertised disturbance in connec-
tion with the Sydney Artists’ Ball may have
value if it suggests to the discriminating one
of the causes of our old friend Social Unrest
The public understands quite well why the
ladies whose names figure on the committees
of most of the big balls are involved in
charity work: in the case of the Governors’
wives it is part of the job, and in that of the
others it is a matter of pushing in where
the Governors’ wives are. The affluent
young women who are attempting to save
the artists from themselves this year did not
embark on the adventure out of love of the
artists’ bright eyes: they demonstrated at
an early stage that they regard the average
artist as one who is unfit to associate with
the Best People. What they really sought
was an opportunity to show that they are in
a position where they can bestow patronage.
One of the most successful employers in
Australia, in the sense that he has few rows
with his immense staff, is Sam Hordern.
The secret is that lie never throws his weight
about. He has enjoyed power and money
for so long that he has ceased to think about
such things. Employers of this type—and for-
tunately for the peace and good govern-
ment of the country there is -a goodly num-
ber of them—do not find it necessary to
ascend an altitude and assume a throat voice
when mentioning the class known to the self-
consciously refined as “persons.” Employers
of the other type mean well —even as the
good ladies of the Artists’ Ball committee
did —and they are dumbfounded when their
little excursions into the ducal manner of old
melodrama are taken amiss. Yet inevitably
this patronage always is resented, as even the
British royal family has fully grasped. Be
simple. Don’t try to “come it” over people
in a country like Australia, which is singu-
larly free of morons. By adhering to those
rules the social and industrial machinery
may be made to run a great deal more
smoothly.

“Henry Horsecollar” to “Bourbon Rom-
anoff” :
I think “8.R.” and I Would get on better if he
didn’t struggle with so many inferences. 1 spoke
of the right of self-governing people to defend their
self-government against a violent and often alien
minority which would snatch it from them. “8.R.”
seems to hold the view that this would be dangerous,
as inferring the right of a tyrant to defend his one-
man despotism against a local and national majority
which seeks to snatch that from him. I alluded to
the well-recognised right of a people’s Gov-
ernment to deport hostile aliens, and “Bourbon”
has a dread that it infers the right of a one-man Gov-
ernment to deport people who are not aliens. Why
“Bourbon” drags in the question of “imprisonment
without trial” is hard to say. Of course people are
imprisoned without trial-—that is to say, British
citizens are imprisoned pending trial, sometimes for
quite a while, because the policeman doesn’t carry a
jury round with him on his beat. Probably undesir-
able aliens who didn’t offer satisfactory hail might
also have to be imprisoned pending deportation. It
is very sad—also “Bourbon” is very diffuse. Inci-
dentally, I know well enough that the modern edu-
cated Briton has “a positive craze for legality.”
Having been born and educated in Britain myself
1 naturally dropped to the fact. The deportations
which the Briton did during the war, and the occa-
sional execution of an alien in the Tower of London,
and all his other brave and spacious doings were con-
ducted with strict legality. I hope Australia will
always follow the example of Britain in this respect.
This, however, is a side-issue. The important point
is that I advocated the legal deportation of non-
Australians who propose the overturn, by violence if
they think violence the most promising means, of
our practically republican form of government. Any
statement to the effect that I advocated anything
illegal is a lie. Any statement that I advocated
the deportation of republicans, as such, is a lie. Any
statement or implication that I advocated the de-
portation of any of our own citizens (I presume
the allusion to the deportation of Lord Birkenhead
and King George is meant for that) is a lie. These
statements can be enlarged upon if necessary, but
perhaps they are sufficient as they stand.
“Borom” : Arguments for cremation accumu-
late. A paper recently read before a scien-
tific society in England summarised the re-
sult of some extensive bacteriological exami-
nations of the soils of three different grave-
yards, one of which had not had a burial
within it for nearly 60 years. These exami
nations revealed that the soils contained
nearly all of the commoner pathogenic organ-
isms, including germs of typhoid, diphtheria,
tuberculosis, dysentery and anthrax. It is no
exaggeration to say that a very large ceme-
tery like Rookwood must constitute a stand-
ing menace to the adjoining city; it is, in-
deed, probable that it acts as a perpetual
source of infection. The burial of patho-
genic organisms by no means renders them
harmless; indeed, in the case of some, like
anthrax, it is commonly believed that their
growth and virulence increase in the soil,
where they probably originated, and which
is consequently their natural medium or
habitat, rAnyone wanting to help towards

three weeks on my new FIAT 501 car I must say that the result
surprised me. Using the car in the Northern Suburbs on Commer-
cial work, over a distance of 881 miles I used 28 gallons of motor

The radiator has never been added to since leaving your works.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the Federal Gallery :
In a thoughtless moment Bruce and Page bestowed
the Defence portfolio on a peaceful solicitor. They
must have regretted it a few days ago when the usual
weekly hullabaloo occurred, this time over the Air
Deferfce Bill. That measure contains clauses enabl-
ing members of the Air Force, permanent men and
trainees, to be employed on war service, or in
learning their business, “either within or beyond
the limits of the Commonwealth.” Once outside
Australia, “on active service,” they are to come
under the British Air Force Act, large sections
of which are incorporated in the Australian measure;
and in time of war they may be brought under it by
proclamation, without leaving Australia. To all of this
the Laborites stormily objected. The Government tried
to still the tumult by defining “active service” as
in the Imperial Act, but discarding the reference
to that piece of legislation. Thereby it increased an
uproar which, I suspect, aroused a lot of .silent
sympathy among the Bruee-Page supporters. Charl-
ton, the' Labor leader, was quite wrong in accusing
the Government of devious conduct, but the flounder*
ing and muddleheadedness displayed in the handling
of the situation justified the protests of his followers,
who, with all their faults, have a stronger sense
of Australian nationality on these questions than
sundry so-called Nationalists behind the Cabinet.
The whole trouble arose over the flabbiness ot
Bowden. He appeared to have no intelligent grasp
of the bill he was piloting. The unfortunate con-
veyancer. became so confused that Groom sprang to
the rescue with a well-meant but tedious explana-
tion that seemed only to add paraffin to the con-
flagration. In the end Bruce came to tha rescue of
his pounce-and-parehment authority on war by secur-
ing an adjournment. Considering that Charlton was
then demanding a division on a vital amendment,
the Laborites were entitled to regard the Pnnu
Minister’s move as a victory for them on points.
Vic Treasurer McPherson has announced
a ’ surplus of £374,000, of which he says the
railways supplied £32,000 and general re-
venue the other £342,000 As he has till
the end of July to make “adjustments ( (Aus-
tralian Treasurers are great on < l ‘
ments”) the final figures may show £400,000
to the good. When analysed the total is not
quite so fine as it looks. W ith 1 arhamen
tarv sanction, the Treasurer lifted nearly
half his surplus from the licensing fund.
That was the oil that helped the Liquor
Bill through.
New season’s wheat has been selling at 4s.
Id. a bushel in the Chicago pit. Ihe Com-
monwealth Government has promised the
farmers 3s. a bushel at siding and Bd. more
for freight and handling charges. W hen this
guarantee was announced Parker Moloney,
MHR for Hume (N.S.W.). demanded an-
other shilling a bushel for his cocky consti-
ments Keminded that the N.S.W Labor
Government’s last effort in this direction had
cost the taxpayer £968,000, that being the
difference between what the Government
thought the wheat would be worth and what
it actually realised, he loftily declared that it
didn’t matter, and Charlton expressed the
same opinion. One way of checking this
zeal for buying votes with the people’s money
would be to make politicians financially re-
sponsible for unpayable guarantees—to _ de-
prive them of salary until the deficit is wiped
out or they are heaved out, whichever hap-
pens -first/ Then no one would mistake the
so-called guarantee for an impudent bribe,
offered to a minority of electors at the majo-
rity’s expense.
Westralia has accomplished its 12th con-
secutive deficit—£4os,3sl this time. _ It is
the smallest for seven years, yet it is over
235. per head, and if the U.K. performed in
the same way it would be £54,000.000 to
the bad. The huge State makes deficits by
keeping taxation far below the average. If
its politicians were not capable of doing the
maddest things for no reason at all, it would
naturally be assumed that they aimed at
State bankruptcy, and either complete, repu-
diation or a compromise with the public cre-
ditor.- A peace debt of £l3B per head net
and an accumulated deficit of £5,910,000,
which is £l7 per head, are unusual enoiigh
to set people wondering. But not Westralian
people—they take their Jimmy Mitchells
as their Jimmy Mitchells come.
The Sydney house-shortage is filling so
much space in the daily papers that the
Coogee lady in the trunk will be crowded
out even if she is found. Sydney seems to
be shorter, and to have been short longer,
than all the other cities. For the year just
GOING UNDER,
“N. S. Wales’s exports in the past 12 months were £9,230,000 less than the imports, let in oldei
to merely ply interest on its foreign loans it must export £8,500,000 more than it imports—of
borrow the money to pay the interest.”

closed a record number of buildings were
put up—10,352. As a result the scarcity
increased. The position is that
metropolis grew at the rate of 9770 per
year between 1891 and 1901. Then to 1911
the rate was 14,853 per year, and from
1911 to 1921 it was 26,960. Since then it
is estimated at 30,000, and 40,000 a year is
hoped for. As no politician dreams of build-
ing an overflow city—why, there you are!
Where else would you- expect.to be?
From the Queensland Gallery:—
A. C. Elphinstone, the new deputy-leader of the
Disunited party, doesn’t propose to let Theodore
have it all his own way in debate. He gingered
up the Address-in-reply by his criticisms of the Gov-
ernment, and had none the worse of a brisk verbal
bout with the Premier. When Elphinstone was
“up” Labor members paid him the compliment of
crowding the Ministerial benches, whereas, some of
the herbs on his own side rose ostentatiously as soon
as he began speaking and absented themselves through-
out his address. It was this mean-souled bitter-
ness, more than anything else, that drove the
member for Oxley from the Gnashers to the
Cookies and on to the Unitods, all in a year or so.
Still, his wanderings from group- to group have left
an impression of instability which he will have to
live down. The man has a fine presence, a good
delivery, and an excellent grasp of affairs. He only
needs to show that he has fixity of purpose for
the leadership to become his.
In 1922 the factories of N. S. Wales em-
ployed 49,200 more people than in 1911. All
the rural and mining industries combined
employed 6400 less. This is presumably be-
cause manufactures are pretty much left
alone by loan fiends, land-resumption (with
borrowed money) sharks, bogus philanthro-
pists, Million Farmers and other eloquen-
tial nuisances. Perhaps some good might
result if the man on the land were likewise
more left alone. It might be necessary to
build about four short lines to as many ports
in order to save the present railway extor-
tion. After that old Stodgy Authority might
rest for 10 years from borrowing, blither-
ing, railway-building, speech-making and
muddling, and await results.
A poultry producer at Macksville, up in
the north of N. S. Wales, sent a crate of
fowls to Sydney the other week. They
realised £3 Os. 5d.; but all he got was Is. Td.
The biggest bite was taken by the Kail way
Commissioners, who swallowed £3 11s. in
freight. The far-away farmer lias no words
of condemnation too bitter for railway exac-
tions; but his real grievance is against the
centralisation which makes distant Sydney
his only market.
Vie. Treasurer McPherson has forced the
Met. Gas Co. to bring down the price of gas
from Bs. 6d. to 7s. 6d. a thousand feet. 1 irst
he agreed to feed it with coal to the extent
of one-fifth of its weekly requirements, at
455. a ton, and then he applied pressure to
set the reduction. There will be a further
fall as supplies of coal come forward from
Maitland (N.S.W.), where peace has been
patched up again. Grice, chairman ot the
Met. Gas Co., is ill, and his co-directors were
adopting a “public-be-dashed” attitude till
there was a rumpus in Parliament. Then
McPherson came on the scene, and there
was no lack of vigor in his manner of pass-
ing on the Assembly’s kick.
A plot that went astray gives a clue to
the present feeling in Vic. Assembly. Home
earnest supporter of the Lawson Govern-
ment conceived the idea of hiring a special
train to meet the returning Premier at
Albury. He canvassed members on behalf
of the ’scheme, but Prendergast’s team asked
to be excused, and the Cockies’ answer
caused another drop in the temperature.
But the worst aspect of the affair, from the
Government’s point of view, is that there
wasn’t a unanimous chortle of pleasure
among its own followers. The metropolitan
Liberals, in fact, scorned to be associated
with the suggested joy-ride. 'So the matter
had to be quietly dropped.
There is to be a triangular fight for the
Daylesford seat in Vic. Assembly. By the
chairman’s casting vote, It. 11. McLeod, a
journalistic son of the late member, got the
N.F. nomination, and stands a fair show
of winning if J. McDonald (Labor) and L.
Trembath (Mayor of Daylesford and nominee
of the Cockies and the Townspeople’s League)
do not exchange votes. Whoever wins will
have to stand again in 13 months at the
outside.
A picturesque smash was that of the West-
ern Counties Shipping Co. (England). The
concern started in 1915, a year before the
Commonwealth line, with £lO,OOO capital. It
increased its capital to £2,500,000. It lost
£3.550,000. In 1920 it bought up a rival
fleet for £1,825,000, and in 1923 said fleet
(11 steamers) was sold for £266,000. That
doesn’t suggest that the depreciation written
off the Commonwealth ships is any too much.
The redeeming feature about the W. C. S.
Co. and similar private derelicts is that the
debt is paid off or cleared away—the Bank-
ruptcy Court sees to that —and no one is
still paying any mournful old interest bill
10 or 50 or 100 years after the funeral. To
make a loss in business is natural; to keep
the corpse lying about is morbid. And that
is what you do when you merely write some-
thing in a book about it.
On a House that is getting crowded: —
One of Speaker Watt’s little worries is how to
make a do of the accommodation of the House of
Heps. Since the Country party was formed it has
annexed two apartments, one ,of which is the occa-
sional refuge of Earle Page, though, as a Minister,
he has access to the Ministers’ room next to the
Chamber. The advent of Watson, the Independent
member for Fremantle, has compelled the Speaker
to supply him with a corner to hold his party
meetings and formulate his policy. Then, Nelson,
the N.T. man, who has no vote or party standing,
has to be specially segregated; whilst Hughes is
also walled in. Meantime the House is. getting popu-
lar as a residential roost. Johnson, the ex-Speaker,
defies all precedent by occupying a bed on one of
the top floors. Also, one of the permanent officials
is temporarily flatting in an eyrie that affords a
fine view of the surrounding city.
Labor members put up a brisk scrimmage
over their demand that the seamen should
nominate one of tlie directors of the Com-
monwealth Shipping Line. This form o(
plural voting is quite a pet idea. As regards
the X.S.W. railways the plea is that the
employees, in addition to their ordinary share
of control as voters, should nominate one
Commissioner out of four. The position has
been figured out in various ways, but when
2A per cent, of the voting community de-
mands 25 per cent, of the control it looks like
a claim for 10 plural votes apiece. It hasn’t
yet been proposed that the clerks should
elect one-fourth, or one-third, or the whole oi
the directors of the Commonwealth and
State banks. But a bright spirit once said
that members of Parliament should form a
constituency by themselves, and elect from
outside a member to each House to look after
their interests.
The 2.( 100,000,000.000 th report on the
Northern Territory has been supplied to the
Bruce-Paragraph Government by the learned
Professor Baldwin Spencer. Some features;
Inquiries were made with regard to the possibili-
ties of finding artesian and sub-artesian water on the
main overland stock route. They found plenty of
water, and there was no reason why the land should
not be fully developed.... North of the Macdonnell
Ranges was wonderful pastoral country.... Motor
transport was needed in place of the customary camel
transport, as shown by the fact that the 300 miles
from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs could he covered
bv a car in two days, while it took 10 days with
camels.
The census report, like many previous docu-
ments, made it known that almost all over
the N.T. “unlimited artesian supplies can
he got at depths of 100 ft. to 350 ft.” but it
will be pleasant to hear it a few thousand
times more. The idea of motors to do 300
miles in two days, instead of trains to do
the distance in 10 hours, will give the Gov-
ernment food for reflection for a year or so.
Then a plan for a “scooter” service may be
due. And that will give food for reflection
for a few years more. If reflection could
populate the Territory it would be closer-
settled by million's.
A BAS THE BLACKSHIRTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
“The Labor Council in Sydney condemns file
Fascisti movement and demands that it be kept out
of Australia.”
We are full of Christian charity
For all sorts of chaps from across the sea
Whose seeming mission is Cain to raise
In one or more of a dozen ways.
I.W.W.’s jar no whit
Upon bur tolerance infinite;
The frowsy Communist may spit
Venom at. whosoe’er he list
And yyeTl find excuse for the Communist.
But we’re hot and vengeful upon the track
Of these Dago blokes in the shirts of black.
We take r,o harm when we meet and mix—
As some of us have —with Bolsheviks.
We shrill no curses and lay no ban
(They may mean well) on the Ku Klux Klan,
We have generous sympathy to-day
When Irish envoys are shipped away
For saying—whatever they like to say.
But our gorge it rises, our eyes grow misty,
With rage at the doings of these d —d Fascisti.
We’d cheerfully stretch ’em upon the rack
For their sins, these Skis in the shirts of black.
’Tis an outrage foul when free speech is checked,
We view no action as too direct
When it makes a sweep of such odious things
As rank and riches and crowns and kings,
Like the sun dispelling the mists and vapors.
But when Mussolinis essay such capers
With Trades Hall tyrants and Labor papers,
When they lay upon Demos’s back the rods
That himself has fashioned — that’s over the odds.
No other rebels shall welcome lack
In this land of ours; but we’ll head them back.
These innovators in shirts of black.

Twelve months ago the Q.N. invited share-
holders to celebrate its jubilee with a special
bonus of 24 p.c. This year a similar distri-
bution is made without any comment, and
evidently shareholders can regard the 12|
p.c. as the prospective regular div. rate. In
that case there should be no difficulty in find-
ing subscribers for the new issue of 80,090
fully-paid £5 shares at a premium of £2 each.
On a 10 p.c. div. basis this new scrip would
return 7 1-7 p.c., but the bonus would lift
it to almost 9 p.c. Without the assistance
of earnings on the £.560,000 which the new
issue will bring in, last year’s visible profits
are almost . ample to pay the higher rate:
paid capital will be increased from £BOO,OOO
to £1,200,000, and 124 p.c. will take £150,000.
or only £650 more than net profits disclosed
by the latest accounts. Assuming that the
new funds earn only 4 p.c. net, £22,400 more
will be added to annual profits. Evidently
the management has good prospects of finding
profitable employment for the additional capi-
tal and reserves; it has certainly not been
forced into seeking new funds to give credi-
tors the cover required by accepted standards.
It is generally deemed safe, in the Common-
wealth, for a bank to employ up to £8 of
outside money for every £1 of its own funds ;
the Q.N. at present holds only £6 10s., and
when all the new money is in the ratio to
existing liabilities will fall to £4 9s. That
means that the management will be in a
strong position to open new 7 accounts and
generally expand its business.
The only movements of note in the follow-
ing comparisons are the increase of deposits
and further expansion of advances.:—

The improvement of deposits is better than
at first glance, because two years ago
the Queensland Government transferred its
accounts from the Q.N. to the Commonwealth
Bank. In 1914 1J million of the £6,560,809
of deposits was held for Commonwealth and
State Governments, so private accounts are
44 p.c. larger. On the other hand, the ex-
pansion reflects a certain amount of inflation
due to heavy Government borrowing and
abnormal conditions arising out of the war.
Nevertheless the Q.N. has made good pro-
gress : not so many years ago, when it was
still endeavoring to extricate itself from the
wreckage which fell on it in the ’nineties,
deposits were less than half present figures.
One legacy of that old trouble which has
become a valuable asset to present-day share-
holders is the £3,091,669 of interminable
stock, representing 15s. in the £ of old pri-
vate deposits which were funded, and which
carries only 3J p.c. p.a. That stock is nowa-
days really very cheap pref. capital.
Though advances continue to expand, the
liquid position is still sound: at June 30 one-
half of all outside liabilities was in cash or
State-guaranteed securities. The balance
(£3.965,645) was backed by advances with a
book value of 7| millions, and premises and
equipment shown at £559,169. Of the latter
item the accounts announce that “£170,000 is
revenue-producing.” The last trace of the old
troubles disappeared from the balance-sheets
five years ago—except, of course, the intermin-
able stock; but the Q.N. is still interested to
some extent in cos. which helped it out of
the ditch: the Q. N. Pastoral Co., which took
over station properties that had been thrown
on the bank’s hands; and the Millaquin
Sugar, which runs canefieid properties.
The inevitable has happened to the Pat-
rick S.S. Co., the war-baby which got into
the coastal trade when vessels were not so
cheap as they now are, and which was given
a had jostling ,by the Associated cos. At
September 30 last year the P. and L. account
was £85,892 in debit, and besides £62,302 of
secured creditors (the E., S. and A. Bank)
there were other liabilities totting up
£10,474. The co. has now decided to go
into liquidation, and the liquidator will pro-
bably discover that all the paid capital of
about £90,000 has been lost. However, the
co.’s services are being continued, and there
are prospects of a new co. being formed to
take over the wreckage and give the enter-
prise a fresh start.

Latest figures show a recovery, but for sev-
eral reasons they are not so good as they
look. Owing to depressed markets and high
costs the financial year ended March, 1922,.
yielded net earnings only a trifle in excess of
the 7 p.c. div., and suppliers received no
rebate of commission-charges. During the
past year there was a better demand and
prices improved; nevertheless, all the
war-time inflation had gone, and the gross
value of turnover at slightly more than four
millions was £786,000 less than two years
back. The drought helped in this by restrict-
ing production. The books closed with a net
profit of £28,341, but though that was 13000-
odd more than in the 1919 financial year
the fact must not be overlooked that turn-
over last year was nearly 1£ million more.
Consequently whereas in the former year
refunds of commission were butter, 334 p.c.;
other dairy produce, 25 p.c. ; grain, 15 p.c.;
and fruit and vegetables, 10 p.c.; for the
past 12 months the only rebate was 20 p.c.
in the dairy-produce section. The rela-
tively smaller earnings were accounted for by
higher costs: the ratio of expenses to turn-
over was lower than in the 1921-22 period of
depressed prices, but Bs. 4d. p.c. more is
absorbed than in 1919 and 325. 4d. more
than eight years ago. Here are details:—
Total Expenses per £lOO
Turnover. Expenses, of Produce Sold.
1915.. £1,817,588 £47,214 £2 12
1918.. 2,638,827 74,721 2 16 8

1923.. 4,004,187 147,248 3 13 6
The C.F.S.’s big trouble is that it cannot
reduce expenses proportionately to the fall
in values of produce, notwithstanding the
greatly-increased turnover. Had the past
year’s turnover of four millions been handled
at the same cost ratio as the £1,817,000 of
1915, expenses would have been £82,419 in-
stead of £147,245. Put another way, net
profits would have been £64,829 larger. How-
ever, in a co-operative enterprise the volume
of profits is not the first consideration: what
really matters is whether the handling and
marketing is as efficient and as economical
as it should be. And this, at least, can be
said : though costs have been higher, charges
have not been raised.
In the next comparison salaries and wages
and other expenses are separated, and costs
are calculated on gross earnings:—

1923.. 175,588 62,404 84,844 83.8
Eight years ago 29.1 p.c. of commission
charges and other earnings was available
for divs. and bonuses; last year only 16.2
p.c. During the current year the manage-
ment will need to watch its costs-sheets very
closely: the North Coast Co-operative Co.,
which has put its Sydney business through the
C.F.S., has decided to market on its own
account from this month, and to the C.F.S.
that will mean a loss of about £750,000 of
turnover per annum, though some of
it is being recouped by new .’sup-
pliers. Evidently the North Coasters
believe they can do better than the
C.F.S.,* and their enterprise will be watched
with close interest. From a co-op. point of
view, the breakaway means the establish-
ment of a third distributing organisation in
Sydney, with all the attendant overhead
charges.
A feature of the C.F.S.’s career is
that after 23 years it has practically no
visible reserves: almost every penny of earn-
ings has been distributed. *So long as the
management continues to act only as agent,
and shuns speculating in markets, there is
little need for reserves, though the society
would have been the ‘stronger had some of
the fat earnings of earlier years been left
with it to help expansion. Instead, to secure
adequate funds for new interests, the society
has had to pay away hundreds each year to
canvass_ new shares. Paid capital is now
£107,095 compared with £76,579 three years
ago. At March 31 fixed assets had a book
value of £44,371, stocks totalled £85,072,
£BllO had been advanced to a food-preserv-
ing subsidiary, the establishment costs of
branches in Melbourne and Hobart and a
poultry section stood at £6344, and £10.267
had been invested in the Wholesale Federa-
tion in London and other co-operative ven-
tures. Capital was inadequate to carry all
these interests and current trading, and the
society at the balance was working on £12,930
of deposits, owed £38,240 on sundry accounts,
and was leaning on the bank for £41.281. The
big items in the balance-sheet, of course,
were the. accounts due to consignors and
those owing to the society by buyers. The
latter owed £236,281, but as the co. works
on prompt-cash settlements that amount re-
presented only 60 p.c. of the turnover for
the month of March, or equal to only 19 days’
sales. On the other side, the amount due
to suppliers represented only 41 p.c. of the
month’s turnover. Here are figures for the
past four years:—

only £107,000 of capital manages to handled
turnover of four millions and settle promptly.

Net profits were a few pounds more than
for the previous year; but the directors
voted £l6OO to a staff fund from latest earn-
ings, and that amount is not included in the
table. During the, financial year there were
further falls in paper prices, but the co.
did not suffer. Throughout the period of
slump the co. appeared to do well; probably
in the years of rising values “book earnings”
were a good deal more than those disclosed,
and stock values may have been well pro-
tected by contingency reserves. Altered con-
ditions have made some difference, though;
for 1917 £45,361 net was earned on total
funds of £441,590, a return of 10.3 p.c.:
last year £61,353 was earned on £662,822,
slightly under 9 p.c. But ordinary holders
are doing very well: 10 p.c. is being paid
regularly on their old holdings, which were
increased by the transfer of £50,000 of re-
serves, and on all the new subscriptions (at
par) got in when costly stocks were held. The
portion of last year’s profits available for
them gave a return of almost 13f p.c. They
now have £172,082 of reserves assisting
£404,231 of paid capital.
Edwards-Dunlop’s principal lines are
paper and stationery, but they are also print-
ers’ suppliers, machinery merchants and gen-
eral distributors. The co. has developed one
of the most thorough organisations in the
trade, and the widespread operations give
the business unusual opportunities. An
important side-line is the financing of
printers and others, and the management
appears to have gone deeper into that busi-
ness since lower stock values released funds.
Six years ago stocks had a book value of
£229,402 and book debts totted up £189,843;
at April 30 last stocks were down to
£202,386 and there were debtors for £328.675.
Meanwhile, outside investments —War Loan
and shares in other cos. —have moved from
£22,216 to £159.414. Further details since
the issue of the first balance-sheet subsequent
to the old proprietary listing its shares on
’Change are shown in this comparison:—
1915 1921 1922 1923

Cash and
investments 17,348 122,406 181,591 190,608
The position is very snug: £721,669 of the
latest balance-sheet total of £802,267 was in
more or less liquid form, though some assets
are much less soluble than the stocks and
public securities: there’s a farming interest
—purchased out of surplus funds in the long-
ago—tucked away somewhere among the list
of belongings. Advances are no doubt pro-
tected by wide margins, and their book
values are further supported by reserves for
contingencies. When final divs. had been
paid there were assets with a book value of
28s. 6d. per £1 ordinary.

Devon Knitting Co., Ltd. (Sydney).—
S. G. Harris has for several years been
doing very well from manufacturing
“high-class novelties in silk and wool,”
and is now passing his business over
to a public co. with the object of
raising capital to lay down a plant to turn
out all kinds of wool and wool-and-cotton
underwear. Net assets as at December 31
were valued at £2167, and having established
a good selling connection and won lucrative
profits from the present range of manufac-
tures, the vendor places goodwill at £2OOO.
lie takes £4OOO in shares and the balance of
£167 in cash in a float in which 10,000 £1
ordinaries are offered for subscription. This
will make paid capital £14,000 and leave
£6OOO unissued. Last year’s profits were
£1873 (for the previous year 37 weeks’ oper-
ations returned £963, or at the rate of £1352
p.a.), and that represents 13-J p.c. on the
enlarged capital, apart from the earnings of
the new enterprise. From a turnover of
£16,000 of manufactured underwear and from
the present business an annual profit of £3173
is expected after providing for all charges
and depreciation. The promoter announces
that several offers have been made to pur-
chase the entire output of the new depart-
ment, but that he has decided to trade in an
open market. Incidentally, if all goes well,
a: larger co. which will manufacture wool
and cotton yarns is contemplated.

According to the published accounts Mt.
Morgan dropped £70,000-odd during the 12
months to May 31; nevertheless the directors
“have decided to continue operations in the
hope that an improvement will be manifest
during the current period.” Except for the
statement by the directors, and stressed by
general-manager Boyd, that scarcity of skilled
miners handicapped operations, the prelimi-
nary talk to shareholders is curiously
silent concerning matters of consequence
affecting the mining position. Perhaps
further comment has been reserved for the
annual meeting in Rockhampton this week.
Owing to the slump in the copper market
Morgan worked only 24 months of the 1922
financial year, and "the resumption of opera-
tions was effected only by Premier Theodore
tapping the Treasury to subsidise wages and
induce the miner to go underground again.
In whatever way the past year’s figures are
examined, it is quite obvious that opera-
tions have been disastrous for the co. The
drift was probably not so bad. as the accounts
suggest; the loss of £70,038 was registered
after £36,406 had been set aside for depre-
ciation of plant and machinery, and the
necessity for that provision depends on the
actual demands for wear and tear and wast-
age. On the other hand some thousands less
than in normal times was spent on develop-
ment and prospecting, which provide the ton-
nages for the future. P. and L. figures also
depend on valuations of stocks. The year
opened with 929 tons copper on hand valued
at £55 per ton, and assuming this fetched
the year’s average of £72, the period bene-
fitterl by about £16,000 which really belonged
to the previous year. Against ' that, the
accounts closed with 1978 tons on hand, also
valued at the customary £55 per ton. Should
these stocks realise £72, there will be ap-
proximately £33,500 more to collect. Mak-
ing arbitrary adjustments of these stock
accounts, Morgan may prove to have done
about £17,500 better than the published
figures indicate. One way and another
it is quite clear, on the evidence available,
that the co. did lose a substantial amount.
But its most serious loss was the tearing out
of 266,071 tons ore from the workings, re-
presenting almost one-twelfth of the proved
ore reserves at the beginning of the year.
That is an asset which can never be re-
placed, and its depletion means a shortening
of the life of the mine with no compensa-
tion whatever to its owners.
The full extent of reserves is still un-
known. At the end of May proved ore
amounted to 3,032,911 tons averaging 2.58
p.c. copper and 6.o3dwt. gold. But there
are large tonnages outside the areas measured
up : last year, for instance, 190,583 tons were
hauled from “known” reserves, and no less
than 75,488 came from outside. On the
financial side this shows how Morgan now
stands in relation to other years:—

over and above all accounts owing. Cer-
tainly some of those liquid assets are shares
in cos. whose future is contingent on the
future of the copper industry: there is
£159,145 tied up in the Electrolytic Henning
and Smelting Co. and £88,543 in Metal
Manufactures, Ltd., a neighbor of the E. K.
Co. at Port Kernbla which is turning out
copper products. Otherwise, though, the
investments are a very fine collection: they
include £125,000 in the Australian Fertilizers
Pty., £102,095 of gilt-edged securities and
debentures; and at the end of May £49,863
of cash was held. A new asset not specified
independently is the Dawson Valley (Q.)
colliery, from which Morgan is now drawing
most of its fuel supplies. Formerly the fur-
naces were fed with coke from the _N. S.
Wales South Coast. Last year two-thirds of
the furnace requirements came from the
Dawson colliery, and g.-m. Boyd reports that
under normal conditions, and handling a good
smelting mixture, the substitution of coal
for coke has proved “quite satisfactory,” but
with more siliceous material extraction is
slower. The change of fuel has necessitated
numerous alterations to furnaces, and the
management is still busy endeavoring to
secure full thermal efficiency. But these
are only minor troubles compared with the
big problem as to whether the market for
copper in future will enable Morgan to pay
the high wages its labor team demands and
at the same time show a margin for its share-
holders.
Commonwealth Treasurer Earle Page has
so far not reported progress on his new
loan to provide for the conversion of the
balance of the Seventh War Loan (matur-
ing Sept. 15) which was not taken up on
the terms originally offered: 25 years at
5 p.c. There will be many small holders
who will want cash, but it will be surprising
if the old loan is not soon fully covered. The
revised terms are very attractive: the best
security the Commonwealth can offer is avail-
able at £9B per £lOO, at 5 p.c. interest for
five years, the average effective rate being
£5 9s. 3d. p.a. Holders of 41 per cents, fall-
ing due in 1925 are also entitled to convert by
subscribing an amount equal to that which they
offer for conversion. As the loan is free from
State income-tax, a better return is offered
than the security seems to warrant, and the
terms generally are more favorable than those
offered for similar securities in countries
harder hit by the war.

General-manager Gepp announces that
Electrolytic Zinc intends to turn out 50,Q00
tons of superphosphates annually. Sulphur
won from Broken Hill zinc-concentrates,
which has hitherto been lost in the roasting,
is to be used. Concurrently,’ the agitation
for the removal of the duty of 50s. a ton on
sulphur has been renewed, the argument being
that the farmer will get his super. ss. per ton
less if Jap. and U.S. sulphur is allowed in
free. Meanwhile there is talk of a scheme to
merge all the siiper.-makers into a combine.
As an honorable understanding as to prices
exists among most of them, this move won’t
in itself be much of a change. The co-
operative fertiliser crowd are the bugbear to
any such scheme, for the farmer-shareholder
depends on cheap sulphur to go ahead. Min-
ister Chapman and the Tariff Board would
like to declare boldly for the sulphur duty,
but the Federal Ministry has not forgotten
What happened to ex-Ministers Greene and
Rodgers at the last elections.
* * * *
From an Australian oil-man with inter-
national experience:—
There are very few men in the Commonwealth
who are qualified to offer ,an opinion on its oil
possibilities, for its geologists lack practical experi-
ence. One of the reasons advanced against the exist-
ence of oil is that there are very few seepages or
surface indications of oil, as there are in almost all
other oil-producing countries; another is that the
continent is too old, and is deficient in areas of
recent formation, such as produce oil in many other
countries. Seepages, however, are generally the re-
sult of comparatively recent volcanic action, which
has cracked the superincumbent strata, thus making
lines of weakness along which the hitherto impri-
soned hydrocarbons make their escape. We have
immense areas of favorable sedimentary rocks which
have never been subjected to volcanic action, and
any oil or gas which may have been formed in them
is still in situ.
When drilling for oil was started in the mid-con-
tinent fields of Arharica, and particularly in Cali-
fornia, it was predicted by geologists that no oil
would be found, as there were no reported seepages
in the former field, and hardly any in the latter.
These fields now produce more than one-half of the
(j|S. oil output. Oilfields there were often discovered
by chance; thus, the famous Spindle Top well
of Texas was being drilled for sulphur, but none was
found, and the casing was being pulled prior to aban-
donment, when the oil broke loose and came gushing
up in enormous quantities. All similar mound struc-
tures were then drilled, and in nearly all cases with
success. There was no geological evidence whatever.
The fields of Corsicana and Thrall were accidentally
discovered whilst drilling for water, and similar in-
stances could be multiplied indefinitely. The trained
oil-geolcgist can certainly foretell the probabilities of
oil in many instances, but numerous large wells have
been brought in against geological advice, thus
proving that the drill is the only real test. The oil-
fields of Commodore Rivadavia, Argentina, were found
whilst sinking for water. No geologist could have
foretold the existence of petroleum in that locality.
The Commonwealth Government offered a reward
of £50,000 for the discovery of a commercial oil-
well, but it is hedged about with so many conditions
that it is doubtful whether it will ever be claimed.
Mr. Hughes also agreed to set aside a sum, not to
exceed £5OOO, to be used in conjunction with the
Anglo-Persian Oil Co.’s staff, for investigating possi-
bilities. Reports were to be furnisheid to the Com-
monwealth and State Governments concerned. The
company sent out three geologists, but their time
was limited, and they made very perfunctory obser-
vations. No report has ever been issued to the public
of the conclusions arrived at. Anyway, the
£50,000 reward should have been allocated
to encourage prospecting; we have not the
large financial resources of well-established
oil cos. to undertake comprehensive pros-
pecting, or “wild-catting,” as it is called. This
prospecting, and all prospecting, for that matter,
should be governed by the strictest regulations in
regard to the shutting-off of all waters encountered,
and samples of all strata pierced should be pre-
served, and all waters struck should be carefully
analysed.
There are a number of wells going down throughout
the Commonwealth at the present time, and, although
the drilling is often efficient, the methods of ascer-
taining the existence of oil are crude; satisfactory
oilfield practice, except in perhaps one or two in-
stances, is unknown. In the U.S. productive oil
sands are being drilled through, and passed up as
“dry.” Even in fields where the approximate depth
of the oil horizons is known from neighboring wells,
the most up-to-date oil cos. take samples for micro-
scopic examination and analysis. How much more
necessary is it in our preliminary prospecting work?
Many of our drilling cos. are merely wasting money.
We are inclined to under-rate the value of a pos-
sible oil industry, but I have! lived and worked in
the centre of it, and have witnessed the magnitude
of the wealth that it produces. That we have petro-
leum has already been definitely proved by opera-
tions . in Queensland, ,and it is extremely unlikely
that a country with an area of three millions of
square miles, containing every mineral and metal
that is found elsewhere in the world, should be defi-
cient in this one thing. But from the very be-
ginning it is necessary for the geologist and the
driller to work together and adopt correct methods
to assure that all discoveries shall be handled on a
commercial basis.
Okes-Durack has started its bore in the
Kimberleys. The hole has been put through
hard limestone, and is now in brown shale
and mud. Except on the Okes-Durack and
Freney areas no genuine oil-prospecting is
being done in the West. Very little is likely
to be undertaken so long as the present easy
method of granting exemptions continues.
S. Aus. Oilwells has sent a plant capable
of going down 1000 ft. to Mt. Gambier, and
proposes to commence drilling near Nelson
without delay to ascertain the most likely
spot for a deep hole. Alex. Gordon declares
that “the great area of tertiary strata is
most attractive.” Meanwhile additional areas
have been taken up on the strength of a
report of a new discovery of bitumen, “in-
land from the sea.”
* * * *
The latest from the Adelaide Oil Explora-
tion Co.’s borehole on Iles’s farm at Tliirl-
stone, near Latrobe (Tas.), is that a burst of
gas had occurred and damaged the bore,
feediment from the bottom of the hole had
risen to 3Qoft. from the surface, and drilling
had been stopped.
* * * *
The Southern Ocean Oil Co.’s bore has
reached 1200 ft., and the official report from
Adelaide adds the superfluous remark that
“Tam” Whaley is “very hopeful.”

Amalgamated Collieries (W.A.) during
June shipped 5500 tons Collie coal to Adel-
aide, this being the first lot Westralia has
exported. Adelaide is reported to have been
well pleased, and colliery people are natu-
rally jubilant. Perth is now talking of an
electrical outfit at Collie to rival that at
Morwell (Vic.). Notwithstanding electric
cutting-machines, Collie coal costs 19s. per
ton at pit's-mouth, and unless that can be
reduced, visions of electric development will
be shattered when the enthusiasts get down
to figures.
Brown’s Reward (W.A.) has secured a
three months’ extension omits Yalgoo option,
and hints that a further extension is likely
to be arranged. Optimistic reports are still
being broadcasted by interested persons, but
nothing has occurred to shake The Bul-
letin’s belief that the mine is unsuitable for
a co.
South Kalgurli (W.A.) is distributing
more than it is earning. Working profits for
the year ended March 31, including gold pre-
mium, were roughly £36,500, and two divs.
absorbing £34,376 were paid, leaving only
£2OOO-odd for office expenses, directors’ fees,
depreciation, etc. The combined profit for
April and May was less than £5OOO, but an-
other div., absorbing £18,750, has just been
distributed.
* * * *
Ivauhoe’s financial position is very solid.
Apart from mine, plant and ore reserves con-
taining £1.139,469 of gold, but which, accord-
ing to chairman Govett, are practically value-
less under present working conditions, the
co. lias £122,226 of investments, £10,722
loaned out, cash and bullion for £46,412, and
stores valued at £34,687. Investments in-
clude trams, rails, oil, municipal securities
in North and South America, and a wide
variety of industrial ventures in Britain and
Europe. Its Australian interests are con-
fined to the Kalgoorlie mine.
* * * *
A Kalgoorlie report credits Jack McDer-
mott, of the Ivanhoe, with the re-flotation in
London of the half-drowned Sand Queen and
Gladsome mines, at Comet Vale. McDermott
went to London to discuss Ivanhoe problems
with his Board, and to consider the advisabil-
ity of effecting amalgamations with adjoin-
ing mines. He was also understood to have
had a few options on shows new and old in
his bag. .

J. S. Sutherland, a digger of independent
means, appears to have discovered one ol
the reefs responsible for Kiandra (N.S.W.)
alluvial. In 1860-61 gold-production there
ran beyond six figures in ounces. Since
1920 Sutherland, as a diversion, has pros-
pected through Tuena, Trunkey Creek and
the Abercrombie, but it was at Kiandra that
he struck it, after following the invaluable
advice given in the Rev. W. B. Clarke’s
“Researches in the Southern Goldfields.”
Three miles out Sutherland picked up speci-
mens of ferruginous quartz which gave good
tails in the pan, and then he set about find-
ing the lode. After some loaming and cos-
teening, he struck the cap of a reef about
3ft. wide. He sank on it 69ft., and found
that values improved as he followed it down.
The stone is higlilv mineralised, and Port
Kernbla offers £l9 3s. lid. a ton for the
ore in quantity. A co. in 80,000 ss. shares
is being formed; 48,000 are contribs. at 2s.
down, and 36,000 paids go to the vendor
along with £lOOO in cash, against which pay-
ment are ore worth approximately £1350 and
plant and stores valued at £6OO.

Jos. S. Henry has submitted a detailed
report on the Nai Hoot Juita tin property,
Langsuan (Siam), to the Melbourne co. of
65,000 £1 paids and 100,000 contribs. which
was formed to work it. Leases total 610
acres, but so far only 150 have been pros-
pected, and they not thoroughly. L. "W.
Elsum put down 64 bores and 15 shafts, but
only 21 bores reached bedrock owing to
stony ground. Bore values ranged from
fib. 'to ilb. per yd. Osborne and Chappell
checked with 35 shafts, but water was too
troublesome in 16 of them to sink to bed-
rock, and Henry comments that the area
“will not have been adequately prospected’’
until those shafts have been sunk the full
distance. The average value for the 35 was
0.91 b., but in those which reached bottom
1.621 b. The average depth of the area is
28 4ft. giving more than 6§ million yards
material. That is the extent to which Nai
Hoot can be considered a mine until shatt-
sinking discloses what the balance of 460
acres offers. Nevertheless, if sinking of
the shafts stopped by water troubles in early
prospecting gives satisfactory results, the
150 acres assure nine years’ work, handling
60,000 yd. per month. The co. proposed to
work the property by hydraulicing and hy-
draulic jet elevating, but Henry declares that
sufficient water is not available to give the
necessary power throughout the year _ or
justify the expenditure on the size of pipe-
line required. As there is “no data avail-
able upon the yardage treated and operating
costs” he won’t commit himself regarding
the possibilities of Thompson’s suction-cutter
dredge, and finally plumps for a bucket
dredge, preferably a second-hand one. Hand-
ling 70,000 yd. uer month, and with tin at
£2OO, Henry estimates a probable average re-
turn on capital of 15.2 p.c. P-a. over eight
years after fully providing for redemption ot
capital. Consequently, if tin does not go
below £2OO, the Nai Hoot looks a good
thing; and, of course, there are possibilities
in the untested ground.
For £5OOO spent upon Loch Fyne, Matlock
(Vic.), in the last six months, only £7OO ot
gold was brought to light. Manager J. V.
Lake has been hunting about at the No. -
level for fresh stone to get the battery
o'oing. Veins have been found on the
western wall of the big diorite dyke
to the north, but it is the old story ot
plenty of nice looking quartz and very patchy
gold. The rise for the shoot from which a
few good returns came hit stone at < ft. from
the drive, though not the floor of. quartz
wanted. Some bagging stuff is being got
from a 4in. vein south off the rise. Lake s
programme is to get away to the south-west
crosscut until he strikes the centre of the
dyke, and then rise to see if the gold-bearing
shoot being opened up near the shaft makes
in that direction, as it is a fable m the mine
that shoots of the kind carry good gold.
Tyrconnell, Kingsborougli (N.Q.), is on
the call-list again after paying a couple ot
divs last year and maintaining an average
around 160 tons per month giving 18dw..
The show lacked adequate financial backing
from the beginning, and for a long time
struggled along: in a hand-to-mouth way with
inefficient plant. Nine months ago, when
the stopes above No. 5 level showed signs
of becoming depleted, the directors decided to
go 112 ft. deeper with the mainshaft and
open out a No. 6 level. But the reef was
not where it was expected, and did not show
up until driving was 206 ft. from the shaft.
1 lowever, it proves to be 6ft. wide there
and carries 40s. values. But funds have
given out, and calls on shareholders and a
benevolent Government are necessary to
finance opening out. The Mines Depart-
ment has agreed to advance £ for £. Ibe
find in the No. 6 level is encouraging, and
there are prospects of good tonnages from
it and the level beneath. Previously the
co, had been operating in old workings, and
is now in virgin ground for the first time.
The Billy Hughes Co. is making a start
on its Bruce mine, Normanby field (N.Q-).
and manager Meredith is confident that
operations will be profitable from the word
go. Unlike the Frederick, the Bruce ore is
free-milling, and that will expedite returns,
besides saving freight on concentrates.
The old Anglo-Saxon United, Mt. Usher,
Rockhampton (N.Q.), is to be given an-
other go. R. R. Richards and party have
been opening it up on a small scale and
winning gold from the upper-tunnel and
winze. But the proposition has become too
big for them, and a limited liability co. of
26,000 ss. shares is taking over. Scrip is
to be paid to 2d. on allotment, and calls of
Id. per month will follow.
Briseis (Tas.) sluiced for only four
months of the 32 covered by the accounts
to December 31 last. Unfavorable
weather held up Lindesay Clark’s diversion
work on the Ringarooma River, and the co.
missed the market when tin prices spurted.
The working loss amounted to £3-3,298, fol-
lowing on £14,629 for the previous year.
Nevertheless the accounts closed with cash
and investments totalling £16,398, and pros-
pects of continuous productive operations for
some years. Work will go on at the mine in
the deep cut in the Krushka flat and right
under the old river bed. The diversion works
have stood all strains to date, and if they
survive the wet season Briseis should be on
an even keel. Most of the ground sluiced
since the nozzles resumed has been poor
stuff, going less than a pound. The bend in
the lead has been passed, so values should
improve. Clark will next have to get rid of
the lower sheet of hard basalt in the Ringa-
rooma hill and work down to the gutter
ahead of the deep Krushka face. This is a
big job, but Clark is the man for it. The
lead is now so deep that much more water is
required to lift the drift, and that will affect
results.

“V.L.”: Pretty well any early Enzed can
assure “V.C.” (B. 12/3/’23) that there was
no libel in the yarn that a remark by Gen-
eral Sir A. Godley’s wife made him unpopu-
lar. He was watching a mob with full kit up
slogging through ankle-deep sand when his
lady blew along and said: “Make them
double, Alec; I do love to see them double!”
I don’t know about “Do it again, Alec,” but
RADIO NOTE: BROADCASTING.
I do know that when Godley was around
Ismailia and Moascar he was always sure
to hear “Make ’em double. Alec,” from any
spot where two or three Enzeds were gath-
ered together. And his look when he did
hear it wasn’t pleasant to see. Birdwood got
some notoriety, too, from a remark of one
of his womenfolk. His daughter, Nancy,
V.A.-ing at Harefield, used to cheer the
patients with “Hurry up and get better, be-
cause father wants you back.” The request
was meant kindly enough, no doubt: but as
most of the Diggers to whom it was addressed
were hoping to go anywhere but “back to
father,” they didn’t generally give it three
cheers.
“Sixenate” : To some extent divorce is he-
reditary. In a recent cross-action in Sydney
the parents on each side were separated; and
so were a brother
and sister of the
lady concerned. I
know five married
people, brothers
and sisters, o f
whom but one is
living in domestic
felicity ; and, as he
has been married
only six months,
he hardly counts.
The mother of this
bro o d divorced
their father, her
two sisters finished
their lives apart
from their hus-
bands, and the
parents of these
three had a stormy
life of separations
and reunions. This
is where heredity
comes in. Th e
woman who has
grown unused to
accepting as natu-
ral the interfer-
ence which the
most good-natured
husband imposes,
and the man who
has kicked over the
matrimonial traces,
pass to their child-
dren, by example
and the circum-
stances of upbring-
ing, an unwilling-
ness to submit to
the restraints
which make matri-
mony possible. It’s
a point that seems
to have escaped
anti-divorce cru-
saders ; they might
add it to their
other arguments.
“Wilfrido”: A M.L. Judge brought this on
himself the other day. Counsel was seek-
ing a new trial on the ground that the
verdict of, the jury had been against the
weight of evidence, and was vainly endeavor-
ing to get ’s ’Onah to see the point he
was driving at. “But if I had been on this
jury,” said the Bench, interrupting petulantly
for about the tenth time, “I would have come
to that conclusion.” “We are not concerned
with what you would think, y’r Honor,”
came the ambiguously crushing retort, “but
with the opinion of a common juryman with
ordinary perception and average intelligence.”
“Sierra”: Demetrius was a
wizened little chef who cooked
and did odd jobs in the Bass
Strait fishing fleet. He used to
make a delicious dish of fricas-
seed octopus and mutton-bird,
served up with boiled dumplings
and wild cabbage cut from New
Year Island. Flour, meat and
potatoes were the staple food
carried on the schooners from
the mainland, and when the
meat and spuds were finished
Demetrius kept, us going on
birds, fish and wild vegetables.
The cooking of octopus was a
labor of love with him, for the
skinning was a long and tedi-
ous job; but the result was
worth the trouble, the flesh
beiDg as firm and tender as
chicken. He averred that all
sea-birds were good eating, and,
if expertly skinned, free from
rank smell or fishy taste. To
prove it he skinned and cooked
a molly-hawk. I had tasted
albatross before, so was not
yearning to sample its near
relative; but those who did
voted it just as good as boards
ing-house fowl. With his levies
on sea, air and uninhabited
islets Demetrius kept the crew
in good fettle and as strong—
physically, I mean—as a crowd
of battery mules.
“Spare Corp.”: There had been a sing-
song at the Y. Emma one Sunday when we
were out of the line, and I heard his cobbers
bantering Nobby over his misbehavior. “I
don’t know much erbout religion,” he said
defensively. ’Ow was I to tell it wasn’t a
nymn? There’s God mentioned in it!” It
came out that the chaplain had called upon
the boys to nominate the hymns they would
like sung, and Nobby had indicated a prefer-
ence for “God only know’s how dry we are.”
“Lex”: The Melbourne police held up 3000
motors the other day and only one driver in
three was able to produce his license. Some
had “expired licenses dating back as far as
1918.” The registration numbers on 17 of
the cars had been cancelled, and three cars
carried wrong numbers. The fines averaged

“Jimmy, that big, red-headed coot over there is my husband .

about 155., which seems inadequate in view
of the facts that the motor-car is being em-
ployed in 90 per cent, of the murders and big
robberies of to-day, that accidents are on the
increase in all the cities, and that the police
rarely trouble about the bona fides of car-
drivers or their number plates. In N. S.
Wales, for example, an unlicensed driver
might use a car with a bogus number for
months and consider himself unlucky if
detected —provided he kept off the Sydney
harbor punt. The motor-car is like milk, a
very useful article, but one that needs watch-
ing.

“T.P.”: In the years when I taught the
young idea how to shoot, I registered many
peculiar names. In ’76 Yeni Yidi Yici
Ventner came along, and that alliteratively-
titled tabby topped the tree till ’96, when
Mitta Ovens Goulburn Campaspe Loddon
Avoca O’Reilly took pride of place. Unfor-
tunately her sister-nippers summed up her
capitals, and she became Mog Claw. It is
hard for any youngster to start life with a
handicap like this, but what shall be said
about the parents who selected such a string
of names and the accommodating parson
who conferred them?
“Curlew 7 ” continues some proverbs:—
Charity begins at home —and is expected to return.
Speech is silver, silence is golden—winking is
brazen.
Charity and blankets cover a multitude of sins.
Many a true word spoken in jest has given a man
a black eye.

“Rio”: “The Deacon” (B. 19/7/’23) re-
fers to Australian polo-players’ snobbery in
tvearing solar-topees. The headgear v 7 orn
is not a topee. It is not even the shape of
one. It is a special protective helmet lined
w’ith much elastic padding to prevent injury
in case of a fall or a blow. The same shape
is worn in England and America at all sea-
sons.

“Iford’s” philological note :
Whatever may be the derivation of the word
“Pommy,” the suggestion of “R.G.N.C.” (B.
19/7/’23) that it represents an Australian effort
along the lines of Cockney rhyming slang (immi-
grant—pomegranate—pommy) can be ruled out. The
argot in question may be vulgar and meaningless,
but it is at least crisp and pungent of its kind. I
don’t know why “R.G.N.C.” attributes it to the
18th and early 19th centuries; my own impression
is that it attained its rankest luxuriance barely a
generation ago. I can still remember a London
music-hall ditty of the ’eighties beginning:—
As I sat in front of the Anna Maria
Warming my plates of meat,
I heard a knock at the Rory O’More —
And so on. For the matter of that, the blague is
still current in parts of London to-day. About 10
years ago, a well-known English writer, describing
an early-morning visit to Covent Garden, recorded
that he heard one porter genially inquire of another
“How’s the bother and Gawdfers?’’ and a cabman
express his opinion that a colleague hadn’t been
“first for a bubble.” He appealed for enlightenment
and learned that, in rhyming slang, a wife is a
“bother-and-strife,” and kids are “Gawd ferbids”;
also that sober is “first of October” and a week is a
“bubble-and-squeak. Curtailment does the rest, in the
same way that “babbling ’brook” is shortened to
“babbler.” But no such halting and impossible rhymes
as “immigrant” and “pomegranate” would pass muster
with the professors of what was no doubt originally a
new development in thieves’ patter. It’s too patently
lacking in snap and ginger.
“Whitehall”: Lord Alfred Douglas, who
purchased his annual libel suit last week,
typifies one of our most pervasive institu-
tions —the over-the-fence gossip. Like all his
tribe he flies high. He alleged that Winston
Churchill had drafted a false report of the
Jutland battle and been paid £40,000 by
the Jews (who had themselves netted
£18,000,000), and that Lord Balfour had
also been involved in the swindle. All lies,
of course, but published in the utmost good
faith, Douglas having heard the stories in
some cases at first hand, and in the others
at second hand. When tackled by Patrick
Hastings, K.C., Douglas replied with the
irrelevant acerbity of an elderly spinster in
the presence of an insistent creditor: —
Anyhow, I would not take your opinion, the
opinion of a Labor member who sympathises with
Bolshevism.
The people who collect and_ spread the
world’s scandals are always like that—in-
tensely complacent, not to say supercilious,
in the firm conviction that they are only
acting as good citizens and devout Chris-
tians should. At different times I have
been disposed to doubt that Mrs. Blank is an
habitual adulteress, and that her friend,
Mrs. So-and-So, drinks and drugs. I have
even found myself questioning if anything
really reprehensible occurred at last Sydney
Artists’ Ball. The reason is that every time
the Empire’s Douglasses appear in court to
substantiate such allegations there never is
a fragment of genuine evidence to support
them.

“Wilfrido”: You can lead a typiste to the
machine, but you can’t made her think.
“Cooralco”: Western N. S. Wales still
keeps traces of the journey of Sturt through
the country in 1845. At Menindie, on the
Darling, whence the expedition plunged into
the interior, several river gums retain mark-
ings that the explorers put on them nearly
80 years ago. Mt. Robe, 20 miles west of
Broken Hill, situated on the edge of the
Barrier Range, has a cairn of stones 15ft..
high which was used as a survey mark by
Sturt. Sturt’s Depot Glen, 200 miles north
of Broken Hill, is situated at the foot of
Mt. Poole; a few posts of the sheepyards
built by Sturt are still standing. Half-a-
mile down the creek is Poole’s grave under
a beefwood-tree, on the trunk of which the
“J.P., 1845,” cut by Sturt, can be distinctly
seen. The grave is now fenced in, and a
cement tombstone has been erected by the
owners of Mt. Poole station. Five miles to

DR. DINGUMIN : “Ah, if your husband could
be induced' to follow my last prescrip-
tion all your troubles would be over.”
MRS. RURATUB: “They would, sir! He
made me pour it down the drain , sir.”
the west ot the Depot Glen is Mt. Sturt, with
a cairn of stones on its summit. During the
forced stay at the Glen, necessitated by
drought, each member of the expedition kept
himself fit. the story goes, by carrying one
stone per day to the hilltop. At Fort Grey,
in the N.-W. corner of N. S. Wales, is a
gum-tree with Sturt’s brand on its trunk.

THE MOTHER SEWING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here she sits at her machine,
In the dusky little room,
Stitching with a face serene
Tiny pinafores for. Mary,
Sweet and lightsome as a fairy,
Scarlet hood.s that never vary,
Skirts for Marjorie and Jean.
There are patches on the floor.
There are toys just cast aside;
Fists are drumming on the door.
Does she think at the beginning,
While the silver wheel is spinning,
While the cotton reels are thinning,
Of the time she’ll sew no more !
Does she stop to wonder, she
With her Angers scarred and worn,
When she’ll fashion daintily
Lovely little frilly laces,
Light as leaves the west wind chases,
Ribbons white as Winter’s traces —-
Wedding things for Marjorie!
Silent then the old machine!
Fast the shuttle and the thread !
All that she has loved has been ;
There will be no more the laughter
Echoing from floor to rafter,
Nor the feet to follow after —-
Feet of Mary, or of Jean!
Never more the whir and drone,
Little Mother tired and worn,
When they all have kissed and flown !
There will be no more the swinging,
Of the busy bobbin springing.
Yet she’ll hear the wheel a-singing,
Sitting by the fire alone!

“Bad Bill”: I concur with “R.G.N.C.” (B.
12/7/’23) that the word “Pommy” is no
very recent coinage. I heard it used some-
thing over 22 years ago. I went to Brisbane
in October, 1900, and a few weeks later the
Jumna landed a shipload of immigrants.
In references to the new arrivals, both
“Chummy” and “Pommy” were used, the
former predominating, Inquiring as to the
second term, then new to me, I learned that
it dated from the days when, immigrants
came from the old world in wind-jammers.
Passing through the tropics diarrhcea was
always rife, and pomegranates, for use. as
a corrective, were a regular part of the ship’s,
stores. Even now they are used, afloat and
ashore, to alleviate this unpleasantness. At
this distance of time I cannot say with cer-
tainty who was my informant, but memory
insists it was one Yeates, known to The
Bulletin, I fancy, as “Rab Scott.” Any-
how, it seems a reasonable genesis of the
much overworked expression.
“N’Yoik” on a threatened Jehad: —
“Captain-Chaplain” Wilson, • M.L.A., gasped re-
cently into the pendulous ear of one of Sydney’s
garbage-journals: “We are going to have an adapta-
tion of the Ku Ivlux Klan in Australia. Without
any doubt it will be going full blast in this country
shortly. The Klan in America is led by Col. W. J.
Simmons, ‘lmperial Wizard.’ In three States they
have already succeeded in cutting out parochial
schools and having all the children educated in the
national schools.” Like the heraldry witness of whom
Lord Coleridge complained, Wilson “doesn’t even
know his own foolish old trade.” Simmons (who is
no more a colonel thah WZison is a captain, but who
for many years was a pairson of sorts) is not the
“Imperial Wizard.” That lucrative billet was taken
from him some time ago by an ex-revivalist named
ASTRONOMICAL.
“Frank became engaged last night—popped
the question by starlight.”
“Yes, and she accepted in a twinkling, I
believe.”
Edward George Young. (Simmons was retired, pro-
testing loudly, with the empty title of “Klemperor,”
an income of 30,000 dollars and a house in Atlan-
ta.) The vast amount of money that lurks in this
foolery may be gauged by the fact that Young’s in-
come, according to the New York correspondent of
London Times, is expected to touch the £200,000
mark this year. Each neoßhyte has to pay 10 dollars
to a local “Kleagle.” The “Kleagle” keeps four dol-

VIVIENNE: “ Don’t waste time on them , dearie- —can t you see me throwing the glad eye

lars and hands one to the local organisation; the
rest, goes to Edward George Young. The Klan has
not “succeeded in cutting out parochial schools” in
any State; nor has it effected any other legislative
change. Legislatively it is as powerless as the Molly
Maguires and the Moonlighters were-—a matter of
being an extra-legal body. Its objective is a huge
membership roll, and in this connection it is diverting
to note that thousands of recent recruits have been
Jews, R.C.’s and colored folks —terrified members of
the classes which the Klan was formed to persecute.

“Faa-fua” : On Anzac Day in Samoa the
usual returned soldiers’ parade and service
were-held. The occasion was also utilised for
the laying of wreaths on the monument
erected to the memory of British, American
and German bluejackets who were ambushed
and murdered during the native rebellion in
1889. At this latter ceremony a full muster
of German residents of Samoa took part,
while a large crowd of British residents were
spectators. I suggest that this is the first
time that Hermans have been permitted to
assist in Anzac Day celebrations. It is an-
other invidious distinction for Samoa.
“Ex-Dig.”: A lady visitor to the battle-
fields of France and Belgium has been tell-
ing the S. M. Herald : ‘T asked why there
W’ere no German graves, and was told that
they always sent their dead back to Germany
so that their losses should never be known.”
This is, of course, nonsense; the mere arrival
of trainloads of cadavers would have made
German losses known where knowledge was
least desired —amongst the German people.
Actually, there were plenty of German ceme-
teries in the area which this lady describes;
if the bodies have gone it is because the
French permitted the invaders, after the
war was over, to disinter their dead, and
take them away for burial in their native
soil. In 1917. when the big craters were
made in the Ypres sector by the explosion
of mines, the German retirement for two
miles took them right past some of their
burial-places. There was a very extensive
one, marked with elaborately carved crosses,
in a place known to us as Pheasant Wood,
although all the trees were gone. Along-sme
this was a moon-shaped earth-bank, behind
which we sheltered when the Fritz batteries
got busy: and I still have an unpleasant
memory of a day when the German shells dug
into their own graves and scattered bones, etc.,
over the bank in * #
“The Deacon” : Dr. Mary Schaelieb, at the
Anglo-Catholic Congress, put the R.C. ( view
on birth-control without equivocation. Arti-
ficial contraceptives are wrong, morally,
medically and rationally” ; more, the Church
forbids even medical men to. interfere once
conception has taken place—if there are in-
dications that life is present that life must
not be jeopardised. The bare idea of abor-
tion is so abhorrent that craniotomy is not
permissible, even although the mother’s life
be endangered. The chief theologian of his
period, the German Jesuit Lehmkohl, once
asserted that craniotomy was lawful to save
the mother’s life, but later withdrew that
teaching. The Catholic medico is hedged
round with ail these regulations, and is often
torn between the teachings of his conscience
and his medical belief; in most cases, no
doubt, the Church teachings prevail. The
stand taken up by the Church is the necessity
of baptism for salvation, and the presumption
of the presence of a soul from the first
moment of conception.
“George Rich”: The grouping of schools
advocated by “Country Ped” (B. 21/6/’23)
has already been tried successfully in W.A.
In the Toodyay district about two years ago
the small schools within a radius of 20 miles
were closed; the children are now conveyed
daily by motor-vans to the central establish
ment. The success of the Toodyay group-
ing scheme is to be followed by the institu-
tion of central (rural) schools in other dis-
tricts. In Westralia 47 per cent, of the
schools have less than 20 pupils on the
roll. Many of the bigger fish have gramo-
phones, mostly purchased through the efforts
of the Parents and Citizens’ School Associa-
tions ; others have pianos, obtained in the
same manner. The P. and C. Associations
are doing excellent work, and their status
is now recognised by Act.
“Te Babarantiko”: In 1916 I part-char-
tered the Sumatra from the King’s Harbor-
master at Rabaul to land myself and a
schooner cargo of rice for my plantation labor-
ers on a New Britain south-coast plantation.
At that time I saw nothing wrong with the
craft. . Her captain and officers offered no
disparaging comment on the vessel, which,
indeed, did very well in quite a bit of head-
sea on a coast notorious for spells of bad
weather. Both the Siar and Meklong, too,
looked capable enough craft. Anyway, the
late General Pethebridge. in his inter-island
trips, for choice travelled in the Sumatra.
The “life” of an iron vessel in the calcareous
and highly-corroding Avaters of coral latitudes
is comparatively brief, however, and seven
years would make an appreciable difference
in the plates of an old steamer. As to men
going to sea in rotten hulls —well, I have
known them compete strenuously for a berth
in notorious coffin-ships and become bitterly
indignant when shooed off by a humanitarian
Shipping Board. So that’s nothing to go by.

“Will C.”: The affection of so many artists
for the nude is intelligible enough. When
Nature created man and woman she did
not reckon on her masterpieces being obscured
by inelegant rags which play , the devil with
graceful contours. Unfortunately Civilisa-
tion is a slave to clothes, and even artists,
except the very greatest, have to kow-tow to
Fashion. But the artist gets his own back.
He makes the garments of Civilisation things
hideous to look upon. The critic of the
London Tailor and Cutter has rcceutly
been deploring the profound ignorance oi.
tailoring displayed by artists, distinguished
men being portrayed in ‘"ill-fitting and
hideously-colored suits.” Meanwhile a com-
plaint directed against the artist who draws
clotheless figures comes from the British
Medical Journal, which alleges that many
of the figures exhibit deformities. It may
yet come to this, that a portrait of a gentle-
man will be a composite work, painted by
an anatomical artist in collaboration with a
gentleman holding a certificate from Some-
body’s clothing department.
“Digger’s Father”-: Stead’s Review makes
two confident statements that seem very-
doubtful. (1) “The tanks used in the war
were named after Mr. W. Tank Burall, who
conceived the idea.” A more generally-
accepted explanation is that when first sent
up to the Front the cases were labelled
“tanks,” as camouflage for the benefit of
enemy spies. (2) “Getting the wind up did
not at first imply cowardice or fear, but
the apprehension of a fluttering emotion.”
It is a fine distinction, and any Diggers I
have asked laugh at it. I fancy the phrase,
as it stands, has been shorn of two con-
cluding words from motives of delicacy.

“Verey Light” screens a picture: —
At the end of the memorable cross-desert march
from Tel-el-Kebir I saw a battalion come into camp
at Ferry Post. At least that part of the batt. came
which had not stopped by the wayside to swim
in the Canal or bathe its tired feet. A company or
so arrived opposite a wet canteen just as it opened.
For a moment the column hung fire ; then it wavered,
dismissed itself and rushed. Officers yelled threats
and commands; n.c.o.’s growled advice; the mob
replied with whoops and grins and curses as, hurling
aside rifles, packs and equipment, it made for its ob-
jective. In less than three minutes “he road was
empty, except for a group of flabbergasted officers
and a few envious n.c.o.’s ; and for a couple of hours
afterwards g.s. waggons were busy gathering the.
debris. But the brightest memory I have of that,
morning is of a hefty six-foot captain, well-mounted,
urging a dusty Digger to take his feet from the Canal
and get a move on. The Digger left his feet where
they were, and put his soul into his reply: “Get ofl
that blacky horse an’ try footin’ it. The officer
gasped and left the Digger to it.
“Adamascus”: A mining shaft has been
discovered in one of the main streets of Mt.
Morgan, over 200 ft. deep, and containing
80ft. of water. It was sunk more than 30 years
ago by a miner who spent much time and
money in an unsuccessful attempt to find
gold, ’ and was finally timbered up and for-
gotten. Ever since then traffic has passed
over it, until at last the timber rotted, and
only a few feet of stones and earth held the
road. Then this, too, gave way, luckily at a
time when no traffic was about, for the shaft

THE COOKING OF ROMANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In a recent divorce the petitioner declared that
trouble started on the return from the honeymoon,
over the cooking of meals. The respondent said
petitioner neglected her household duties.”
The tale of true- love like an idyll
May run, with no conflict oppressed;
But a dull aching pain in the middle
Is the judge at the ultimate test.
Though the pair may be wondrous good-looking,
And blindly in love they may seem,
When it comes to a question of cooking
Troubles pend for the lover’s young dream.
The honeymoon flies in a fashion
Ecstatic with radiant bliss ;
The couples are full of their passion
And think a good meal is a kiss ;
But the come-back to earth is most trying,
There’s a bump that affection may shake;
When the girl tries her crude hand at frying,
The honeymoon dream is at stake 1
There are questions that must be decided,
Causing discords and quarrels and tears ;
But squabbles by Love are derided
And may leave them happy for years:
Yes, even the question of bossage
For ages may linger, perchance;
But a passionate plea for a sausage
May wreck the high hopes of romance.

William Benjamin Rounsevell, of S. Aus.,
known in his Parliamentary days as “Big
Ben” to distinguish him from two less massive
Benjamins, has passed out in his 81st year.
He and his brother John used to drive their
father’s coaches on the high roads of the
wheat State, and became partners in the
nourishing business. Sitting in the House of
Assembly for a quarter of a century Rounse-
vell was Treasurer in four Ministries and
Minister of Works in two, having as his
associates William Morgan. John Colton,
Tom Play ford, Charles Cameron Kingston,
John Downer, Jenkin Coles and other big
figures of the ’eighties and ’nineties. As
Treasurer in the Colton Government in
DAVE MACK. S. Aus. sportsman, and presi-
dent of the Coursing Association.
1884-85 he piloted through the land and in-
come taxes. Rounsevell owned Moolooloo and
Cowarie stations, and succeeded his father
at Corryton Park, where lie bred stud sheep
and cattle. For many years he successfully
ran horses and greyhounds, and until re-
cently was chairman of directors of Colton,
Palmer and Preston.
R. R. Black, one-time technical superinten-
dent in the Eastern Extension Cable Co.,
who died in Sydney a few days ago, origi-
nated a number of improvements in sub-
marine and long-distance telegraphy. One of
his inventions, for ascertaining the where-
abouts of faults in cables, is now used by
practically every cable co. in the world,
while another simplifies the work of putting
down new wires. In his younger days Black
spent a good many years as an electrician on
board repair ships, and until he retired about
15 months ago he was superintendent of one
of the M.L. cablb stations. Death overtook
him on his way to join his wife in S. Aus.
Died recently in Brisbane, at 85, John
Henry Nicholson, author of “The Adven-
tures of Halek,” an allegorical story which
was talked about over 40 years ago. Born
in England, he came to Bananaland when
22 to commence a long scholastic life, and
successively established schools at Too-
woomba, Warwick, Nundah, Springstire,
Enoggera, Bowerbank, Sandgate and Bris-
bane. Then he gave up pedagogy and be-
came a district registrar of births, marriages
and deaths. “Halek” was Nicholson’s only
notable work, though he turned out an enor-
mous quantity of MSS. during his life. In-
cidentally, it was his father and uncle who
persuaded Leichhardt to commence explora-
tory work in Australia —a fact which is
commemorated by the Nicholson River
(N.Q.).
Prof. Wood-Jones leaves Adelaide ’Varsity
at Christmas, be-
ing unable to resist
a call to the Chair
of Anatomy at
London Uni., which
combines the head-
ship of the great
medical school at
Bart’s Hospital.
He succeeded Wat-
son in Anatomy at
Adelaide four years
ago, and admittedly
came to Australia
largely to study-
marsupials a n d
other primitive
animal forms.
Wood-Jones was at
one time medical
officer of the Cocos
Islands, and mar-
ried the daughter
of the Governor,
Clunies Ross. He
owns to being 44;
and is more athlete
than professor to
look at.
PETER REIDY,
the sole surviving
Nationalist in
the South Aus,
Parliament.
“Old Parliamentary Hand’s” send-off: —
With the passing of J. L. Dow the last link with
the Gillies-Deakin coalition —-a continuation of the
great Service-Berry partnership —has been snapped.
It is hard to convince myself that 29 years have
gone since Dow was in the Victorian Assembly. In
the five years (1889-1894") that I had to do with
him he impressed his personality as Minister and
member so much upon those of us who met him in
politics that we knew him better than we have done
other members in 25 years. He held the Lands and
Agriculture portfolios. For one act alone—the
setting up of the butter export trade —Cocky should
cherish his memory. When he was in Opposition
Dow’s criticism, satire and wit were antidotes that
the House prized. Fellow-wanderers on the Inky
Way admired him most for the steady fashion he
settled down to the daily grind of work on the
Leader when political glory had departed. They
hope he has left enough copy for a book of reminis-
cences. He had a long innings—-Just on 87.
Within hailing distance of his century,
Ralph Longstaff, father of artist John, lost
his hold on life the other day at Shepparton
(Vic.). He landed in Melbourne in 1852,
tried his luck on the goldfields at Bendigo
and Ballarat, settled at Clunes for a while, and
then, half a century ago, transferred to Shep-
parton and stayed there, doing very well as
a storekeeper. Besides his widow (who is
90) and John, there are four daughters.
Though he has just lost William Fraser,
Priminister Massey (M.L.) is accompanied
into his twelfth year of Cabinet life
by three of his original (July 10, 1912)
selection —Francis Bell, R. Heaton Rhodes
and Maui Pomare. All except Rhodes have
been marked continuously present on the Min-
isterial roll during the 11 years. Rhodes was at
Gallipoli and London for a time, but re-
joined the happy family party four years
ago. A horseshoe for luck, presented by a
lady admirer, has been hanging up in
Massey’s offices throughout his marathon.
Dead at 50, W. A. Prichard, manager of
Lake .View Consols (W.A.) in 1901, and
joint-representative, with W. J. Loving* of
Bewiek-Moreing in Westralia from 1902 to
1905. Prichard was with Hoover at Stan-
ford Uni., and when the latter became a
partner in 8., M. and Co. he selected Prich-
ard as one of his team of mine-managers.
Prichard, in turn, recommended Loring, then
managing the Angel mine in California, as
boss of the Sons of Gwalia. Prichard and
Loring did not agree in double harness, and,
after a visit by Govett, Prichard dropped out.
Big Richard Wood, just dead in Westralia,
where he had lived for some years, was one
of the very first Labor members in S.A. Par-
liament. A blacksmith at the Islington rail-
way workshops, he became president of S.A.
Trades and Labor Council, and went into the
Assembly for North Adelaide in 1893. He
had nine years there, but his unwillingness
to accept Protection eventually sent him into
the wilderness.
Port Adelaide’s oldest seaman, Marshall
Smith, has gone on his last voyage.
Northumberland born (1838), he was on a
sailing-ship that carried wood for the troops
in the Crimea. He brought the J. L. Hall
to Australia in 1872 and settled down under
Elder, Smith and Co. till he joined the S.A.
pilot service, commanding the State-owned
Governor Musgrave, and later becoming
harbormaster at Wallaroo. He had been
officially superannuated, and was 75 when
he took a sailing-ship to England, and at 83
he sailed Napier Birks’s yacht Stormy Petrel
from Sydney to Adelaide.
The ability to get away from the local job
and jaunt to the other end of the earth seems
to be shared these days between the Fat and
the Red. E. R. Voigbt, the glib revolution-
ary who is in charge of the N.S.W. Labor
Council’s “Bureau of Industrial Research
and Statistics,” has now gone on an 18
months’ holiday, which will, of course, in-
clude Russia. The Bureau has only a
moderate number of subscribers among the
unions—and the Labor Council itself is
worse off to-day in the adherence of unions
than at any time during the last 15 years—
yet there is never any embarrassment as to
money when it is -wanted for a Bolshy holi-
day.
Exit from the land-agent business in
Adelaide its oldest member, E. A. D. Opie.
He was a partner long ago of G. W. Cotton,
but survived two generations of that family.
Towards the end he looked a good deal more
than the 80 he was reputed, to be; but he
stuck to business till the last.
Apostolic Delegate Cattaneo will have his
first view of the Islands next month, when
he goes up to conduct the consecration of Dr.
Vesters, Bishop-elect of Rabaul. The latter
belongs to the missionary Order of the
Sacred Heart, which, with the French
Marists, salvages the souls of the nigger in
his native lairs on R.C. lines. The head-
quarters of the Sacred Heart men are at
Kensington (N.S.W.), within sight of the
pony course, while the Marist Fathers hang
out their shingle at Villa Maria.
“Chris”: In promoting Maui Wiremu
Pomare to be M.L. Minister of Public Health,
With authority as such over pakeha and
native alike, Priminister Massey boldiy
leaped the color-line. Still but one news-
paper took exception to the appointment, and
that on the ground that Pomare was respon-
sible only to a native, and not to a pakeha,
constituency for his legislative doings.
Pomare, who is a full-blooded Maori, is a
doctor with a good diploma, and was once
chief native medical-officer. He has the
facile tongue of his race, and can give points
to most M’s.P. in his command of English.
Fred Crommelin, who died last week at
68, became a solicitor in 1876, settled in
Grenfell (N.S.W.), and continued to chase
Costs there till the end. At one time lie
was in partnership with R. D. Bertie, his
son-in-law, now in practice in Port Moresby.
“Bill” Bertram, Speaker of the Banana-
land Parliament, caused a stir at the official
opening of the House by appearing in robes.
Members gaped in bewilderment, as the trap-
pings had for so long been tucked away in
the clothes-press; but, remembering his
prowess as a fighter, no one dared to con-
demn him. Lennon, now’ Lieut.-Governor,
was the first Speaker to discard the flum-
mery.
The first flying-boat service in Australia
is being opened by airman H. C. Miller in
one of the machines imported by Lebbeus
Hordern. A regular service is going to place
Port Lincoln within tw T o hours of Adelaide
(the trip by boat takes 48 hours) : and in-
termediate places will benefit also. The ven-
ture is being made without Commonwealth
assistance, but a mail subsidy is looked for.
Miller served with the Australian Flying
Corps, and since the war has been much
awing.
Retired, after practically half a century in
the service, T. H. Williams. Chief In-
spector of Stock in S. Aus., taking with him
presentations from such bodies as the Stock
Salesmen, Stockowners, Dairymen, Master
Butchers and Bacon Curers. As the Govern-
ment has decided that his successor shall be
a vet., Williams goes out as the last lay
Chief Inspector of Stock in Australia.
“H.”: My tip for Australia’s next “woi Id-
scholar” is a pale, thin-faced youth, Francis
Lions. Last year he collected honors in the
Sydney ’Varsity science course by the bucket-
ful. Class I. honors and the Uni. medal for
both organic and inorganic chemistry came
his way, and he also won the science re-
search and John Coutts Scholarships. Now
the young man is packing his trunk for the
Cold Country, because a cable has told him
he has been awarded the 1851 Exhibition
Science Research Scholarship. He leaves
for Cambridge at the end of the month
Exactly the same honors came to Launcelot
Harrison (now 7 Sydney’s Prof, of Zoology)
when he finished his Course in 1914.
“Volunteer”: “Ex-Dig.”- (B. 26/7/’23) has
slipped a bit re
Grant, the abo. at
the Lit hg o w
(N.S.W.) Small
Arms Factory. His
name is Douglas,
not Donald, and
like many other ex-
Diggers he had to
stand down for a
while when muni-
tio n s were n o
longer wanted, but
was soon re-em-
ployed and now
works in the forge
department. Tli o
agitation by the
R.S.I.L.A. is to get
Grant in the draw-
ing office; but re-
turned men are not
permitted to pick
their jobs—the pre-
ference applies to
“employment” gen-
erally.
E. B. CORNER,
Nationalist
M.H.R. for Wide
Bay (Q.), with
his wonderful
whiskers shorn.
“The Deacon”: The par. about the
M.L. wonder-woman Mary Aubert (B.
19/7/’23) recalls that Australia has had
its wonder-woman too. Over 50 years ago
Mary McKillop, daughter of dour Scotch
parents, seeing the neglect of the children
of the poor, physically and spiritually, in S.
Aus., gathered four other helpers and set out
to toil in the slums, beginning appropriately
enough in a stable. Others joined in, and
the day began and ended with various
religious exercises. From these humble be-
ginnings grew the now-powerful order of
the Sisters of St. Joseph, which has its
headquarters at North Sydney (N.S.W.),
and 'movents, orphanages and refuges in
every Suite of Australia and in Maoriland.
Authority frowned upon the new sisterhood,
but Mother Mary of the Cross, as Mary
McKillop called herself, refused to desist,
and she came under the bah of the then
Arelibish. of Adelaide. But with the help
of the one priest (Tetijijson Woods) who
stood by her, she made her way to Home, and
put her ease to Leo XIII., who squelched
the colonial purple and gave her the neces-
sary briefs. From that on the new Order
never looked back. At present negotiations
are going on for the canonisation of this
wonderful woman, who died about 15 years
ago. The Jesuit scientist and scholar, the
late Donald McKillop, was a brother.
Beardmore, of Benambra, the new- leader
of the Vic. Truly Rural Liberal party,
elderly and respectable, has just the equip-
ment of the ordinary country member. As
he and the amiable John Gordon, of Waran-
ga, got the same number of votes for the
leadership, their names were put .in a hat
and Beardmore, was picked.
Died at 98, ijn a Rest Home at Petersham,
a lovable old lady—Mrs. Elizabeth Cam-
bridge. . Born jat Somerset, she came to Aus-
tralia in her early ’teens in the sailing-ship
and married one of Australia’s first
postmen. There were only three at the time
—on Windsor, Parramatta and Sydney.
Windsor has had three Thomas Cambridges
as postmen, and their service to date totals
86 years. The first Thomas was appointed
without salary, and received voluntary con-
tributions —a penny a delivery or ‘there-
abouts. His record was 24 years. Then
came his son, husband of the old lady just
dead. He served 26 years. And to-day his
son, also Thomas, looks back upon 36 years
in the job.
“Oldfield”: W. H. Clifford, manager of
the North Coast Co-operative Co., Byron
Bay (N.S.W.), after spending close oh 30
years on the Northern Rivers in the interests
of the cow 7 cocky, has settled in Sydney.
With an annual turnover of £2,000,000 his
co. will handle its own products, and to
that end has established a selling and dis-
tributing depot in Sydney, with Clifford
himself on the spot to keep his finger on the
pulse of the market. Originally his was a
spare-time job of book-keeping at £l2 a year
for the early butter makers, but, realising
the possibilities, he persuaded Cocky to
co-operate, and to-day the co. numbers among
its factories the largest in the world —and
Clifford draws a salary that keeps that fact
in countenance.
WITH CARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The care of a mother when lifting
Her slippery babe from his tub,
The care of a lioness shifting
Her camp with a newly-born cub,
The care of a nurse with the wounded
When loading an ambulance train
Is as naught to the bloke
Who prepares for a smoke
With one match on a windy plain.

“Warrumbucca”: Recently a landholder,
charged with failing to destroy rabbits, pleaded
that Bunny had become an adopt at jumping,’ so-
called rabbit-proof
fences. A sceptical
Bench, in imposing a
fine, probably increased
the penalty in order
to discourage such
novel pleas. At the
time I shared the scep-
ticism of the Bench;
but I’ve since had
proof that a 3ft. wire-
netting fence isn’t be-
yond Brer Rabbit’s
lepping capabilities.
Driving the other day
I surprised a rabbo
about 20yds. from the
intersection of two
wire-netting fences. He
was crouching close to
our fence, and when
the car pulled up so
that the pea-rifle could
be brought into action
he took a standing-
jump at the barrier
alongside him, but
failed. Then he in-
stantly dashed towards
the fence 20yds. away
and cleared it like a
bird. It isn’t sug-
gested that the mill-
ions of pounds spent
in Australia on wire-netting represent wasted
capital, as the accomplished jumping rabbit is pro-
bably rare—but he does exist.

“Patiti”: Tom Glover’s sketch (B.
16/6/’23) of the cocky telling the parson that the
wife’s baby w r as a heifer reminds me of big Jim
McDonald, the horse-breaker. His son and heir,
aged 14, had taken to the bush accompanied by dad’s
best hack, saddle and bridle. When mum broke the
news dad quietly remarked: “I knowed the little
blank was no good—l didn’t like his eye the first
time I seen him.”
* * * »
“S. R. J. Irapitet” (Solomon Is.) : While
I was stationed on a plantation in this group,
several “boys” from an adjoining village came
hurriedly to me on Sunday with the information
that one of their mates had had his arm taken off
by a shark. On investigation I found the arm had
been severed just below the shoulder. I did my
best for the sufferer, and on calling round next
day was told that his friends had taken him inland.
Riding through the village about a month after-
wards, I saw the same nigger with the end of the
arm healed perfectly, himself hale and hearty and
in charge of the local white trader’s store. The
incident suggests an entry for the Stamina Stakes
—and certainly blows out the notion that sharks
won’t touch nigs.
“Kenbir”: Hove’s this for a record ? One
of the abos. of the Kendall Expedition, a fine healthy
Bloomfield River darky, was sent into Oooktown for
stores, and our provider was directed to send as
much as the boy could carry, leaving the rest for a
packer. Binghi turned up the day after he left us
with everything. The distance was 25 miles, ano
the weight he humped was 1401 b.
* * * *
“Byro”: Can any Abo. expert explain
this? Recently a goanna on top gear crossed the
track in front of me and at the same time a small
lizard was breaking evens at right angles towards
him. When they were a few yards apart the go.
swung around and opened his jaws, and that fool
lizard galloped into his interior. Investigation showed
that the go. had stopped right over what I presume,
was the lizard’s hole. Was it a fluke, or is that the
goanna’s usual method of collecting lizards? Was
the lizard going too fast to stop himself, or didn’t
he know the difference between a hole in the ground
and a hole in a go.’s face?
“Mugger”: When “Parama” (B. 21/6/’23)
read that in India crocodile hunters use a tethered
“kid” to attract the saurian to his disadvantage, a
young goat was meant, not the Australianism for
child. Indian parents are just as fond of their
own children as other parents are of their offspring,
and would as soon think Of using them for croco-
dile bait. In fact, the Indian rarely meddles with
the crocodile. When the slinking horror becomes too
insinuating some sahib log usually comes to the
villagers’ rescue with his rifle and a tethered kid.
I have not met the Capetown or Port Natal croco-
dile, so concede that perhaps “Parama’s” African
hunting method is authentic.
* » * *
“Spenner”: There is at least one man in
Australia who has a first-hand idea of the torture-
chamber whose walls slowly advanced on the victim.
Harry Stirling got it while grubbing a huge red-
gum on the sloping bank of the Gleneig (Vic.).
The tree leaned slightly to the east, and as there
was. a strong wind from the west he thought it
safe to burrow under to windward to reach the
tap-root. He had delved a pretty big hole, when
the wind suddenly chopped round and blew the
tree back across the hole, where it leaned against
the bank at an angle of about 60 degrees. The
axeman was imprisoned beneath, but as there was
room for him in the hole, he felt there was no
immediate danger, and unconcernedly commenced
to dig his way out at the side. But he found that
his cramped position made this difficult, and an
hour’s toil made little impression except on his
strength. Pausing for breath, he became aware
that his position was growing more cramped, and
EVIL COMMUNICATIONS CORRUPT GOOD SALADS.
SEED SALESMAN: “I should say a foot between the radish and the
onion rotes will he quite sufficient."
AMATEUR GARDENER: “Think so? I'll he on the safe side and
allow them three or four feet. I’d hate the radishes to
taste oniony .”
then he realised that the bank was giving way while
the roots still held. Terror spurred tired muscles
to renewed effort, but slowly his arms were pinned.
Then the pressure was apparent on his chest, and
gradually his breathing became more and more
difficult. Time passed—hours it seemed. Short,
fast gasps only w'ere possible, and these failed to
provide enough air. The captive had shed his last
vestige of hope when the wind as suddenly returned
to the west with increased force—and the tree was
blown clear of the hole. It was a much aged man
who found strength enough to drag himself out.

“Numbugga”: “Golub” (B. 28/6/’2B)
claims that snakes must have water. Well, some
years ago I got a job with Mr. and Mrs. Cocky, and
good old Wire Whiskers duly assisted to fill a new
bed-tick with fresh clean hay for me. Twelve weeks
later, on a midsummer night, suspecting something
THE DIPLOMAT.
CLANCY: “Mrs. Murphy, pure son Mike has just fell off th'
scaffolding and kilt himself .” ,
MRS. MURPHY: “Merciful hivins!”
CLANCY : “Aisy now! ’Tis only his leg that's bruk. an' it's glad
ye trill he to hear it whin ye thought he was killed entoirely."
I left the bunk hurriedly. After I had conducted
an exploratory operation on that bed-tick, I liberated
sft. of black wriggle, rather thin and wasted, but
very vicious. I could quite understand his tan-
trums, for, apart from the indignity of my nightly
steam-rollering him, he had done a fair fast and
a long perish for summer-time.

“Pat Bushie”: Motoring out-back in S.
Aus. I got off the main track, and inquired of a
swaggie the whereabouts of a certain station. “Aw,”
he said, waving an arm in the direction whence 1
had come, “go back t’ th’ turn-off, an’ then foller
t’other road. It’s right out there where th’ wind
starts 1”

“Borom”: If “Jim Dandy” (B. 28/6/’23)
had examined the corpse of his “heartless” rooster
very closely, in all probability he would have noticed
that one of the neighboring large blood-vessels was
developed in an abnoi'mal manner, being four or
five times its usual size. This vessel, on dissection,
would have proved to have been equipped with
chambers and valves, corresponding almost identically
with the auricles and ventricles of the normal heart,
whose place it took and whose functions it fulfilled.
Such cases are not unknown among the higher ani-
mals, and there is even on record an instance of a
woman who had practically no heart at all. Examples
of the organ being underdeveloped, or lacking in
some essential part, are much more common.
“£36”: In the days before the big game
hunt opened on the Continent I did a good deal cf
kangaroo shooting, mostly night shooting, at tanks
and crab holes. I have shot in one night 42
kangaroos, and 1 can take an affidavit for the
benefit of “Jimmy Possum” (B. 3/5/’23) that I
had the pelts off and pegged down, using on an
average 60 nails to the pelt, and had all my
cartridges loaded, by 12 noon. I 1 shot no joeys;
my marks were old men. The man who can’t
skin and peg 15 to the hour had better leave the
game alone. I may say my shooting was done on
the west side of the Darling (N.S.W.), where the
real old men hang out.
“Larrapinta”: On a station where I
worked in the days of my youth there was a large
blacks’ camp, and one day I was given the job of
driving two town ladies over to see the nigs. They
were greatly interested, so I induced a few of
the old bucks to give a eorroboree dance, which the
ladies applauded. Then one old chap, highly delighted
with their approval, offered to do a solo turn, and
retired into a wurlie to dress for the part. His
“dressing” however, was a misnomer, as he suddenly
sprang out, stark naked, and began to prance about.
The shriek my fair charges uttered at the sight was
nothing to the one they let out when he gave his
song:
No got-um tshugar,
No got-um tea,
No got-um shirt —
Poor blanker me!
Both the visitors refused to speak to tne on the
way home, and the boss told me a few days later
that they gave me credit for arranging the whole
show beforehand.
‘‘Ragar”: A case of mammary glands act
ing without the stimulus of childbirth (B. 5/7/’23)
came under my notice in Brisbane not ;j long ago.
In that instance the unfortunate girl’s word was
doubted by the man to whom she was engaged, in
spite of the doctor’s assurance that everything with
her was as it should be, the glands having become
active entirely through sympathetic suggestion. It
is very common among the women of the native races
of S. Africa, and is there largely responsible for the
over-development of the
breasts. In New Guinea
I have seen the same
thing frequently, in
some cases the girls
suckling puppies a
common practice with
the married women in
certain parts of N.G.,
where they also con-
sider the tiny porker
entitled to share their
milk supply with the
baby. It is a well-
known fact that this
nervous and sympa-
thetic suggestion will
often act in exactly the
same way on a man,
and one case came
under my notice some
years ago in which an
Italian, arriving home
and .finding his wife
dead and their infant
girl screaming, put the
child, as a last re-
source, to his own
breast. It quieted the
child’s cries, and, the
treatment being con-
tinued between doses
of warm tinned milk
sucked from a rag, it
finally set up some
form of nervous excite-
ment and eventually de-
veloped a regular flow
of milk. A somewhat
similar case happened
not long ago up in
N.Q., where a colored
man nursed his small
son after finding his gin killed by a snake-bite
* * » .
“Jackaburra”: That yarn about a bloke
nearly chopping off his own head reminds me of a
bit of bush doctoring I once saw. I was kicking
the bike through to Wagga (N.S.W.), and about 12
miles out I cazhe across a couple of wood-cutters.
One had severely* gashed his leg, and as he seemed
to have a good chance of bleeding to death, his mate
had packed the wound with powdered dry stringy -
bark. I rendered first-aid, rode on to Wagga and
had the man brought in to the hospital. With the
exception of a slight limp the chap is none the
worse, but the doctors damned that stringy-bark as
they picked it out of his leg for weeks.

“Ringer” : “Professor” Bates (B. 14/6/’23)
has now put up still another spaying record—33l
cows in eight hours’ working time. Beaufort station
(Q.) was the scene of the performance.
A LITTLE DOUBTPUL.
THE PARSON: “William, I hope you have
quite recovered from your attack of
the horrors
WILLIAM: “I thought I 'ad , sir. In fact,
if that's really you, parson, an' not
something ’orrible, I'm sure I ’ave.”
“Tom Pepper”: “Jay Aye’s” friend (B.
28/6/’23), who swears he saw a, bird which was-a
cross between a pigeon and a parrot, was neither
drunk nor dreaming. During the war Fritz used
the progeny of a carrier-pigeon-parrot cross for
the purpose cf delivering verbal messages between
the front line and the rear. I ought to know, as
it was my job to interrogate the few that fell
into our hands.
THE SHINING VALLEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All the heights are sleeping
In the quiet moonlight—
Can their crests be dreaming
Of some golden noon-light
Passed away forever ?
Hidden in the shadow's
Falling from their shoulders,
Over bars and boulders
Glides the singing river.
Fresh from merry-making
Where his friends still dally,
Comes a rider, riding
Up the shining valley.
Whistling as he passes,
While the white night-splendor.
Through a gap down-falling,
Sets lone curlews calling
From the river grasses.
Like tall nuns that whisper
Prayer and praise together,
Stand the river oak-trees,
Voiceful in all weather,
With their dark tops marking
Where the river journeys;
While a red fox crying
To his mate, low-lying,
Sets the farm-dogs barking.
Dustless lies the roadway
That the teamsters travel;
Rippling o’er its lapstones,
Singing o’er its gravel.
Goes the valley-river.
Fnds the roadway somewhere,
And the river’s wending,
Too, shall have an ending,
Ceasing there forever.
Rut, when this befalls them,
And no more a rover,
Stream and road revision,
Looking long leagues over,
Scenes behind them gleaming,
Moons and nights of glory,
Will no memories rally
To them of this valley
In the moonlight dreaming?
All the heights lie sleeping
In the quiet moonlight-—-
Can their crests be dreaming
Of some golden noonlight,
Passed aw r ay forever?
Veiled is much around us,
Dim the ways we follow—
Who knows height and hollow?
Who knows road and river?

'The Beer
without
a Rival ”
“Dinky Di”: I can beat “Sucre’s” pig-
jumping performance (B. 21/6/’23). Last year at
Dirrinbandi (S.Q.), when ’roo-shooting, I spotted
a few' wild pigs, and emptied my .32 into them.
I knocked two, but got the shock of my life when
an old boar made straight for me. I got the wind
up and made for a fence, 50yds. away. I must have
beaten “Slip” Carr’s records going to and over it,
but even then I was only just in time. I landed
rather clumsily on the other side, and so did the
porker. He cleared the sft. fence with a foot or
two to spare, but landed like a bag of spuds, all
out. I suddenly remembered I had a cartridge or
two left, and finished him off.
SWEET AND LOW.
LOCAL INHABITANT: " You've never bin over
a blacks' camp? It's an experience you
don't wanter miss. You know how Jacky
hums? Well, you can imagine wot it's
like wiv 78 or 19 of 'em, all hummin'
together!”
VISITOR: "Um — yes! Kind of community
singing, as it were.”
“Centurion”: “Pieko” (B. 5/7/’23) asks
why biltong, or dried fresh meat, is not used in
back-block Australia, when it is so popular with
S’Africans and others. Partly because of the trouble
entailed in making. The meat has to be cut in
fairl.v narrow strips and entirely freed of fat; then
it has to be dipped in boiling fat, rolled in a
mixture of salt and pepper, and carefully sun-dried.
More than one W. Queensland station has had a
shy at biltong-making in the past, especially in the
old boiling-down days when meat went to waste
by the ton. But the Hottentot dodge never grew to
popularity with Australians.
“Dilly Dig”: The long-distance riding
figures given by “Jimmy Possum” (B. 21/6/’23>
are distinctly good ; almost as good as mine when 1
humped a 401 b. swag (301 b. tucker, balance razor
and sundries) over 35 miles in 8 hours 45 minutes.
But I knew a young fellow, about 17, who threw
in his marble at (then) De Burgh Persse’s Tabra-
galba station, and rode about 80 miles in one day to
AT OUR RACE BALL.
OUTBACK BEAU (to station visitor ): “May I have the pleasure?”
VISITOR: “ But — er—I have not been introduced to you."
BEAU: “Gawd blime, Miss, ain't I taking the same risk?"
Brisbane on a moke he bought for 30s. He arrived
in the city early enough to make a deal and sold
the horse for two notes. A little later he met me
(I was his brother), and over a shandy he was
telling me of his ride, when a bloke standing at the
bar put in his spoke. “Do you mean to say you rode
one horse that distance in a bit over seven hours?’’ he
asked. The brother diffidently confirmed the state-
ment. “Well, you oughtn’t to have a horse; and
I’ll show' you what I think of it,” and with that
he hauled off. Heigho 1 A lad learns other things
than stockriding when he’s young.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: “Ragar” (B. 5/7/’23) asks
how' a snake drinks. I have seen at least one having
a spot, and he did it by lapping as a cat does.
At old Tamata station (Papua), some time ago,
my bedroom in the split-cane house was next to
the storeroom. In this was a tin of sugar which,
for protection from ants, stood in a tin of water.
On several occasions early in the morning I heard
something lapping the water in the tin, and at last
I stole out to see. Ijt was a brown snake about sft.
long, and he either didn’t see me or had been out
all night, and was going to finish his drink or die.
He did both.
“Kurrajong” : I have just finished pioneer-
ing a wheat and sheep ranch in Westralia, and this
much-disputed question of water supply increasing
with wholesale denudation of timber gives me thought.
Herewith some facts. I was born and reared on
the very top of a range 12 miles from Toowoomba
(Q.). Three creeks had origin within a two-mile
radius, viz., Reedy Creek, Gleeson’s Creek and Bishop’s
Creek. The first two ran into Cooby Creek and
thence into the Condamine; Bishop’s Creek shot
down the range into the Brisbane River. Return-
ing to my birthplace some years ago after an absence
of two decades, I found the head of these creeks
permanently located further dow'n stream in each
ease. Close settlement and much clearing and ring-
barking of the mighty' forest had dried up the
original sources. Now, here in W.A., in the great
wheat belt, there are no permanent creeks —at best
some native soaks. Extensive clearing has in every
case increased the number of these soaks. But they
are soaks and never springs. What may we deduce
in a general way from these facts?
“Ringer” : Can some grey-headed old Abo.
gis’e me the names of the original members of the
“Ragged Thirteen,” who went from Bananaland
across to the Ord (W.A.) and made things a welter
all the way. To date I’ve heard the names of well
over 100, all of whom were reckoned members of
this select band, so I am curious to know who were
the dinkum 13.
* * * *
“Kowrah”: The wife of my cocky neigh-
bor became seriously ill and was removed to a Sydney
hospital. The other day I happened to meet him
in the township, and, thinking to buck him up,
invited him to stop one with me. While we were
drinking the telegraph-boy handed him a wire, and
I saw at once that it announced the death of his
best “hand.” lie stood gazing in a stunned soi-t
of way at the wall, and I hestitated even to condole.
Suddenly his face brightened, and quite a cheerful
expression replaced his woe-begone look as he
exclaimed, “Cripes! It couldn’t have happened on
a better day'!” I was m.vstified till I followed the
direction of his gaze, and there on the pub wall I
read a Government Railways advt. announcing a
cheap excursion to Sydney on the morrow.
* * # »
“Bill and Mack”: “Lou’s” ’roos (B.
14/6/’23) must be of a different breed to those m
the Grampians (Vic.). A racehorse (a winner in first-
class metropolitan company) has been proved to
have little chance with our flying does on open
grass country, but in dense scrub, 3ft. or over, the
steed is an easy winner, as the ’roo has to jump
high with every bound to avoid entanglements, where-
as a good horse well ridden crashes through at
racing pace.
* * * *
“Sarah Anne” : I wasn’t one of the gang
who jumped on “John Moran” in 1907 (B. 24/5/’23),
but I say now that carpet-snakes do slime their prey
before swallowing. Years ago we had six half-grown
turkeys that used to camp in the cart-shed, and one
morning, when there were only three running about,
investigation revealed the other three very dead,
crushed and horribly' slimed, and the head and necK
of one was in the throat of an Bft. carpet-snake.
If the wriggler doesn’t slime its prey, why were
those three so treated? I also remember a carpet-
snake having killed and slimed a four-weeks-old
kitten: we killed the worm before he could finish
swallowing it.
* » * *
“Rupanyup”: How far is this off the
record? P. G. Mcllvene, of Rupanyup (Vic.), recently
for a wager carried on his shoulders for 100yds.
three bags of wheat tied together, each of three
bushels.
“T.P.”: A friend in England has sent
me, as a graceful compliment, an illustrated school
periodical, just to prove that “the youth of our
city are receiving careful instruction concerning
the industries of your glorious land under the
Southern Cross.” Picture No. 1 is headed “Lamb
Marking,” and depicts an innocent little creature
in the arms of a muscular Australian seated on a
fence, while another brawny man is stooping down
in front of the outstretched legs of the lamb. The
letterpress reads: “In Australia, where adjacent Hocks
total millions of sheep, there is danger of lambs
becoming mixed, so each is painted with a distin-
guishing private sign. The man in front is about
to paint the little lamb, which seems to enjoy the
pleasant operation.”
• * * •
“Oobug” : Let me pass on to “Q.” (B.
28/6/’23), who asks for a recipe for the extermina-
tion of nut-grass, that my experience with this pest
has taught me that cultivation and manuring will
kill it. Keep the soil turned over and exposed to
the sun and air. The grass finds its habitat in
extremely hard ground; hence its presence in cracks
such as “Q.” described. After three months’ culti-
vation with spuds or even broad-beans, not a vestige
of the pest remains. It pays to carry out the whole
programme.
“M.S.”: Re “Spinifex” (B. 24/5/’23) on
kangaroo-skinning champions. A couple of years ago
a white man and his three-quarter-black wife scalped
for a living on the North Coast (Q.). His record
for skinning an old-man ’roo was one a minute, and
she could do the trick in a minute and a half. He
could skin a bear in under a minute; her best was
a minutei But at long-distance shots she beat him
each time, averaging three out of four ’roos every-
day. Incidentally, my husband can skin an old-man
’roo in less than five minutes, and he’s no champion.
“Blanc”: Stroud (N.S.W.) is the sober-
est place 1 have ever been in; yet a big green
frog used to come on to the kitchen table after every
meal. I offended my hostess by tossing him through
the window my first day there. “Oh! you
shouldn’t have done that!” she gasped. “That’s
mv little Micky.” She hastened out to pick it up
and replace it on the table in case it should feel
offended, speaking to it like to a child. “Did he
throw my little Micky outside! My poor ’ittle
Micksey that catches Mother’s flies and ’quitoes!’
My violence had not disconcerted it, for it immediately
set to as if on piece-work, hopping hither and
thither, never missing its fly. My. hostess told me
she had had a pair of them for years, but that
Paddy had come to an untimely' end through hopping
at a fly hovering over the wash-up dish which chanced
to be filled with boiling water. “You won’t find
any flies in your bedroom, either,” she added, “for
I keep Algy and Claude there.” Algy and Claude
were two out size “triantelopes.”
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: “Notrelle’s” sure rain indi-
cator (B. 28/6/’23) reminds me. In Bananaland
once, during a dry spell, an old sundowner told me
we were in for good rain because there were long
narrow clouds low on the horizon just at sundown.
He was right; we nearly had a flood. Since then
I have often noticed these clouds, and they never
fail. Incidentally, common salt is just as good as
indicator of rain as “Kowrah’s” brown sugar (B.
28/6/’23).
* * « *
“Colub”: In some quarters there is a
fixed belief that the jackass is immune to snake
venom, but it isn’t. A while ago I was shown a
fully-grown bird which had succumbed, in the pre-
sence of witnesses, to a bite from a large black
snake, the latter’s poison getting in its deadly work
in about 20 minutes. Probably the belief owes its
origin to the fact that the bird’s feathers afford
it more or less protection when the reptile strikes,
just as the superficial non-vaseular layer of fat
beneath the pig’s skin stops snake venom from pene-
trating into the system, and thereby sets up the
idea that pigs are similarly immune. The bird I
saw had a small bare patch on its neck, and it was
here that it had received the blow of the snake.
When opened up both its internal organs and its
blood exhibited all the customary snake-bite signs.
Such cases, however, are extremely' rare, for usually
the jackass manages to get an effective grip on the
reptile just behind its neck.
* * » *
“J.K.R.S.”: When felling a large red-
gum at Rosedale (Vic.) recently two timber-getters
were surprised by' a shower of glass from the stump
just as the tree fell. Investigation showed that at
some time a scarf had been made in the trunk,
and a bottle had evidently been placed in it. The
tree had then grown around the dead marine, and
at the time of the felling the bottle was 15 inches
from the outside. Experienced timber men esti-
mate that 20 years or more must have elapsed since
the process of envelopment started.
LITTLE WILLIE'S CHOICE.
“Which balloon would you like, Willie?”
“Can I have the one with the hat on it,
mummie?”
“Blanc”: On a liollow branch hanging
over the Upper Paterson River (N.S.W.) I saw a
carpet-snake with two coils round a ’possum’s body
and two round the limb. ’Possum put up a game
and fierce fight, biting and scratching deeply until
the snake hit below the belt by unwinding its coils
from the branch, dropping into the river and remain-
ing under the surface until Joey took the count.
Then the wriggler swam out and made a leisurely
meal.
THE FAITH OF ABE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For twenty long-drawn years Abe sought
That reef on Wombat Range,
And all the patient seasons brought
For him no lucky' change,
But just the old familiar blank
No single sign of gold
On peak or spur, in loam or bank,
Or w'here the ridges rolled.
He roamed the slopes—slow, yard by y ard;
His mortar every day'
Was pestle-pounded very hard—
But brought no loud “Hooray!”
He parcelled samples to the town
To geologic seers
For assay; but no luck would crowd
The faith of all those years.
But still the old man battled on;
He ate the wild bush things,
He wore the clothes that Crusoes don
Or passing Pity brings.
His “weed” was what the big hills grew—
Not over-sweet to smoke;
But fat cigars he’d puff, he knew,
When Bad Luck’s “trot” he broke.
He’d nigh forgot a woman’s voice;
The prattle of a babe,
That well might make a churl rejoice,
Had long been lost to Abe.
The lights of cities far away
Had faded from his mind.
“Till I can find that reef,” he’d say,
“Such things is left behind.”
And so for twenty years Abe worked,
Through wet and heat and cold;
His mountain quest he never shirked,
Though he’d grown sick and old.
One day he struck the “cap” he sought—-
The reef was rich and wide....
He glimpsed the g01d....F0r breath he fought.
They found him where he died!

LETTER

Ethel Campbell, the Durban girl who sig-
nalled the glad hand to every Digger who
touched at her S’African town, arrived last
week and has since been renewing her long-
distance acquaintanceships. Not doing it
through official dinners and teas, where she
meets only the brass-hats —the civic wel-
comes have not been of her seeking-—but go-
ing out to where she’ll meet the Digger, the
plucky, wounded-by-the-way Digger who is
living out his life in soldiers’ homes. The
Blinded Soldiers’ Cafe, the Lady Davidson
Home at Turramurra, Canonbury and Rand-
wick Hospital have all been visited. It’s
not every girl who can mash one policeman;
but the whole Force in Sydney handed out
its heart and a party to the girl from Dur-
ban, and there’s not a traffic P.C. who’d
have the heart to make her keep to the left.
The R.C.1., the R.S.L. and the soldier mem-
bers of Parliament have all rallied to enter-
tain her. She’s a small person with a big
smile; but it’s the little woman who has the
outsize in hearts.
Australia’s hearty reception of Ettie
Campbell should provide plenty of meat
for amateur mob-psychologists. The cheer-
ful young lady has the striking personality
that musical-comedy stars are supposed to
possess, only she “puts it over” naturally
and unconsciously. She is wholly frank and
unaffected. That explains the Diggers’ affec-
tion for her, and, of course, their welcome
to her was quite easy of understanding, since
the average Australian is ready to return
one good deed with' two. But the spon
taneity with which their, womenfolk joined
in was less comprehensible. Mothers might
reasonably be expected to take a warm in-
terest in a girl who livened troopship mon-
otony with a few hours’ entertainment at a
port of call; yet that doesn’t account for the
preponderance of wives and younger women-
folk who paid homage to Ettie at the Town
Hall popular reception. It is not customary
for wives to kill themselves in a crush merely
to catch a glimpse of a youngster of their
own sex from oversea. Womanly curiosity
is the probable explanation. If it was, 99
out of every 100 of these younger women must
have been pleased that they did go “sticky-
beaking”—for if they came to peer they re-
mained to become ensnared by the flag-
waving girl’s frank personality. And her
smile did the rest.
According to a newly-returned Australian,
kraska is the correct tint for the finger-nails
in London and Paris. Those little pinned-on
side curls still coquette on many a head below
the gay or classic bandeau, though at Ciro’s
and the Grafton Galleries and the smart
night clubs of Paris ears are worn bare,
and the hair is drawn back till in many
cases it has the “painted-on” look of a Dutch
doll. The London woman has at last
screamed aloud against the Paris edict that
always clothed her out of doors in black, and
feels almost gaudy in her tan colorings, her
beige and her navy. Almond green is a
heavy favorite, and ear-rings are worn with
everything. Coral has come back, and crepey
materials in printed designs will be worn
by Sydney next summer.
The Painter-Etchers bubbled into hilarity
that could almost be heard on the next floor
of the Education Building one night last
week, even though the etchings on the walls
did have their fingers on their lips as if say-
ing “H-s-s-h ! Let ordinary artists splash about
in lurid headlines; we etchers are respect-
able folk.” An orchestra dispensed dance
music, and a few couples fought against cir-
cumstances and swung into the dance; but
the reproof of the exhibits seemed to triumph,
and they took the time slower and slower,
till they finally doddered to a standstill. One
wouldn’t mind betting 2s. 6d. that no en-
gagement rings were netted from that gather-
ing. There were beer and cigarettes, and
something with a bite in it at the bar in the
corner, but by 10.30 the gayest dog thought
cheerfully of home; and by 11 the etchings
had the place to themselves, and could relax
their vigilance.
While the Apollo Club was giving its stir-
ring and vigorous 205th concert in the big
Conservatorium Hall, the small hall opposite
was packed with the higher-brow musical
lappers purring over a recital of modern
music. These recitals are given every few
weeks under the wing of the British Music
Society; and the programmes contain one or
two outstanding features. The big work last
Thursday was the Elgar Concerto for ’cello
introduced to Sydney by Gerardy. James
Messeas drew the bow this time, with Henry
Penn at the piano. Jenny Cullen, David
Nichols and James Messeas, who leave on
August 2 to join Verbrugghen in the U.S.xv.,
gave their last public performance in Sydney
in a quartet by Hurlstone. Margaret
Chalmers, in a beautiful pink frock, all
flowing lines, supplied tenor Appleby’s
accompaniments, with the serene poise of
one who knows her work well; and Pauline
Harford turned on a crystal-clear spray of
song.
Prominent on the committee which organised
a dinner to the Acting-Premier was Arthur
Rickard, president of the Millions Club.
They have met before. In a debate held over
30 years ago in the Oddfellows’ Hall, Wool-
lahra, Charlie Oakes, then “Premier” of the
local Literary Society, opened up his sub-
ject in brief, pithy sentences covering less
than 10 minutes. Such brevity did not suit
Arthur Rickard, who led the Opposition,
and he prefaced a discursive speech by genially
comparing his opponent’s utterance to a
cow’s tail. “My opening remarks,” Oakes
replied, “have been derided as ‘short and
sweet.’ I can only answer that my hon.
friend’s speech reminds me of a German
sausage—-long and very mysterious.” Oakes’s
side won the debate.
Douglas Fairbanks, as the swashbuckling,
half-legendary Robin Hood, lifted a heavy
purse in the interests of the Children’s Hos-
pital the other night. The hold-up was at
the Crystal Palace, and the front of that
temple of delight was made up to represent
Sherwood Forest with entanglements of Lin-
coln Green streamers, lanthorns and brush-
wood. Attendants in dashing green jerkins
and gallantly feathered caps handed out
nosegays tied with blue ribands and the-
compliments of Enid Bennett — she’s the Maid
Marian of the piece. The vice-regal For-
sters were among the first-nighters, with
Lady Patricia Blackwood, the Braddon,
Fuller and Rickard knights and their ladies,
the Chief Justice Knox couple, the Attor-
ney-General Bavins and Acting-Premier
Oakes, not to mention half the Ministry and
various Consuls. The Hospital’s secre-
tary, Clarence Moss, stood in the vestibule,
a Robin Hoodish swagger about him, for
wasn’t lie like the hero in the movie—tak-
ing from the Rich to give to the Poor?
In a week as heavy socially as its fore-
runner was temperamentally, the three
gayest functions were the Convents’ Ex-
Students’ dance, the Waverley ‘College ball,
and the Wesley College dance. Youth for-
gathered at these as thickly as bees round a
patch of clover, and with the same enjoy-
ment.
The dance in aid of the Royal Hospital
for Women takes place at the Palais Royal
this (Thursday) night. The decorations
from the Arabian Nights’ Ball will add
gaiety to the scene. Special dancing dis-
plays will be given by Bendrodt and Peggy
Dawes and by Ruth Kingsley and J. Robin-
son. Nicholson’s have the tickets.
Scots’ College Old Boys’ annual dance will
happen on August 1; they can buy their
tickets at Nicholson’s.
Monte Luke’s camera caught Stella Power
just like this the other day. Stella, who
ended her Town Hall season last week, is a
Victorian girl and a pupil of Melba’s. The
exquisite voice really has the Melba quality
claimed for it.
It is pure and
even, and, in
the Mozart
numbers par-
ticularly, like
the larger-size
prima donna’s.
In her four
years’ absence
from Australia
she has sung
all over Eng-
land and Scot-
land, and even
i n troubled
Ireland, under
the manage-
ment of Pow-
ell’s. The Aus-
tralian girl
has a remark-
able flair for
clothes, and a
stage deport-
ment that adds dignity and height to her
featherweight. In private life she is Mrs.
O’Rourke.
This (Thursday) afternoon the Bush Book
Club w’ill be at-bome for the purpose of
refilling the library shelves. Club members
and friends are invited to drop in with a
book any time between 11 and 5 o’clock.
Both the G.-G.’s and the State Governor’s
ladies, have promised to be present.
The decorations for the Egyptian Ball
are just about completed, and in a final
brainstorm the committee decided that
around the galleries will be a frieze such as
adorned the walls of ancient tombs. A
ribald suggestion that there should be a
funeral service as well was not even list-
ened to.
To-morrow (Friday) will be gladdened by
the Violet matinee at the Royal. Sydney
Ure Smith has designed a programme, the
vestibule will be a bank of violets, the audi-
ence will be given a chance to see Mrs. Pitt
Rivers and Annette Ivellerman on the same
stage, and everybody who buys a seat will
help the Children’s Hospital.
Ex-Sister Kelliher, of the beauty parlor at
the Australia, has donated a prize of a
course of hair treatments for the best Egyp-
tian head-dress at the Egyptian Ball on the
30th. Miss Kelliher, who has a medal from
the French Government for special war ser-
vice in France, spent three years as mas-
seuse in a war hospital in England.
Here’s the latest grin in artistic circles.
D. H. Souter, who so dramatically resigned
his job as foreman of the decoration com-
mittee for the Artists’ Ball, was, later on,
magnanimous enough to let the committee
proceed on the amusing scheme of decoration
which he had planned. Last Friday night
he drifted into the paint-room at Her
Majesty’s, where the decoration committee
was dowm to it with sleeves rolled up, and
presently he was slapping the color on a six-
foot poster as heartily as any man present.
But he had to have his joke, so made a pre-
tence of hiding his identity behind a mask.
If his name had never been mentioned in
connection with the Artists’ Ball —and he
is a shy man who flies from a reporter’s note-
book—-you’d be glad to know how the man
looks who in-
vented t h e
famous cat. So
here he is—-
with May
Moore’s help.
There are few
more versatile
men in Aus-
tralia. His re-
markable line
draw i n g s
everybody
knows; but he
has played with
almost every
known art
medium, h e
has a head for
business the
came fra’
Aberdeen, and
is one of the
chiefs of Wil-
liam Brooks
and Co.), has written some rattling good short
stories, is an ex-president of the Society of
Artists, was an untiring war-worker, and
has invented more jokes for illustration than
perhaps any other draughtsman living. No-
body ever knew him do an unkind thing ;
thousands have known him do kind ones.
Spring is going to be glorified by a glad
burst of Chamber music ; and tenor Walter
Kirby opens the season with an afternoon
concert at the Royal Colonial Institute next
Tuesday afternoon. Tickets are being sold
at 10s. 6d. each, and Mrs. George Earp is
patroness of the movement.
Mrs. Milson, of Kirribilli, was among the
Australians presented at the last Court. She
dressed herself for her call at Buckingham
in powder-blue georgette embroidered in
steel beads, worn over satin of a darker
shade. With this she carried a pale-pink
feather fan. Mrs. Milson, who is a clever
photographer, has been out taking photo-
graphs with such eminent camera-artists as
the Mount Everest men and Major Dugmore
—author and big-game man. She has met
the Prince again, and been to lunch with
Sydney’s old friend Lady Northcote.
Arthur Eedy, of the M.L.C. insurance office,
will watch liis only boy, Noel, take on a new
responsibility at St. Philip’s next Wednes-
day evening. Her name is Jean Brooks —
her late father was a Public Service C.E. —
and afterwards she is going to help grow
wool at Yass. Noel left Sydney Grammar
to join the air force, and served with that
wing on the other side,.
Kath. Kelly, only daughter of the Dr.
Kellys of Wingham, brought a free heart
back from her travels in Europe; and now
she has promised a life interest in it to Jack
Tysoe, eldest son of the Tysoes of Bowral.
and is sporting the usual seal on the bargain.
The name of Kath.’s home is Elysium, and,
come to think of it, that’s a queer name-
plate for dad’s sick callers to face.
Apia went gay the other week, and turned
up to a man for Mrs, Tennant’s farewell
dance to the Tyndalls. He had been engi-
neer of Public Works on the island for three
years. They do the ladies proud in Apia.
Against the name of every dance on the
programme the local poet had burst into song
—his own or someone else’s —highly eulogis-
tic of the fair. Judging by the length of the
programme and the number of the “sittings-
out” the party went on till the night after.
And then there was an agricultural show’,
and the Samoa Leader printed a special
edition to the glory thereof; there was eveu
a column given over to the ladies’ frocks,
and that was written by Mrs. Bob Suther-
land —Y.A.D. Connie Read she used to be.
Her description of the goings-on ended on a
sigh of satisfaction; “Eggs may be never
less than 3s. 6d. a dozen, but. oh, don’t we
have fun!”
The lame dogs of Sydney lost a firm friend
the other day by the death of Mrs. R J
Lukey, wife of a former sec. of the Austra-
lian Gaslight Co. Prior to her marriage in
London, 40 years ago, she was the head of
an English girls’ school, and distinguished
herself in the classical world by translating
with her father (he was in charge of the
MSS. department of the British Museum) a
number of old documents which hitherto had
been undecipherable. Coming to Australia
she devoted much time to charitable objects’
and she leaves monuments in the form of
homes and associations which she either
founded or was instrumental in getting-
founded. A husband and one daughter, the
wife of a country clergyman, are among
those who are mourning her.
David Jones’s Miss O’Keeffe is back after
six months’ work for the firm in Paris and
London. While abroad she linked up with
Grace Baxter, Miss Armstrong (who is still
piloting Australians through Europe) and
Isabel Ramsay.
Here’s a Polo Week story. A well-known
professional man bundled his books into a
small suitcase and descended on his auditor
the other morning preliminary to sending in
his taxation papers. Later, still clutching his
suitcase, the medico drifted into the lounge
of one of the big hotels, where he met some
friends. After half-an-hour’s consultation
on Prohibition, lie motored home with the
suitcase coyly reposing at his feet. That
night, opening up the bag to extract a needed
paper, his popping eyes discovered not a neat
pile of account-books, but a frothy confec-
tion of Georgette sleeping-suits, b'eribboned
caps and mules. On the inside of the lid the
name of a well-known bachelor was neatly
engraved. While he was pondering the situa-
tion, the telephone rang; and from the other
end a rather agitated male voice informed
him with regrets that his suitcase with its
collection of books had been picked up by
the speaker’s sister—had the listener, by
any chance, got hold of the one the speak-
er’s sister had lost? The professional man
replied he had. Then an arrangement to
effect an exchange at the club was entered
into. Later the professional man was tell-
ing the story to some of the other fellows.
At the close of the yarn a quiet man in the
group drawled: “Did you say his sister?
Why, he’s got only one sister, and she's been
in Europe for two years.”
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matthew has gone bush for a few days. Accord-
ing to his itinerary, having passed the time o’ day
with Mrs. Lumley Hill, he was to take car to Ipswich
and hand out medals and give a talk to the W.E.A.
Then the McConnells, at Cressbrook, were to bag
the vice-regal party for a week-end before the return
to the city.
Before leaving Brisbane his Ex. sat pleasantly
through “A Night with the Classics,” arranged by
Harry Borradale in the Albert Hall at the instigation
of the Shakspeareans—a show that deserved the
packed house. He also accepted smilingly the job
of president of the Q. branch of the Red Cross.
Mrs. Willie Collins, fresh from hobnobbing with
the Davidson Excellencies in Sydney, returned to
Nindooimbah the other day.
Edris Forth has just promised her dainty hand to
Phil Allom. So, despite ’flu, Cupid still goes a-
hunting.
The Lyceum Highbrows arose in their pride to tea
Ethel Bage, of Melbourne ’Varsity Graduates’ Assoc,
and several other things, and they had the backing
of the Q. grads.’ body. The fair visitor is just back
from a trip to Korea.
The R.Q.A. Club left motor-cars alone for a space
the other night and jazzed furiously at the club
rooms to keep out the cold. The Dodwells gave a
dance on the same evening amid a blaze of poinset-
tias.
Girl Guide Margaret Prior is to stay at Government
House while in Brisbane.
Lilian Clancy, as the result of an offer of marriage,
collected a solid silver tea-and-coft’ee service on a
stout oak tray, sheaves of white lilies and bales
of sweet-peas, at a good-bye evening in Leonard
Francis’s studio. After the wedding bells have rung
for her she will live in N. S. Wales.
The Craigend Old Girls, in an access of skittisli-
ness, hung St. Andrew’s Hall with their school colors,
and under lights shaded in the hues of anarchy jazzed
well into the other morning-. The same night the
State Insurance Ball came off in another South Bris-
bane hall, in a setting of bobbing balloons, gum-
leaves, palms and stooks of sweet-pea.
With a suit-case full of anecdotes of Lloyd George,
Amy Giles, who was sec. to Philip Kerr (and he was
sec. to L.G.), is in our midst. Lady Astor was also
served as social sec. by this much-travelled young-
woman, who goes on to India and Java when she has
had enough of Central Bananaland.
The Health Department having been prodded to
wakefulness, a campaign is being directed at cafes
in the city where rats were seen gaily disporting in
the windows. A John Hop declared on oath that he
saw 17 of the horrors cavorting among bananas in
one establishment, whereupon the proprietor was
fined £3O for keeping rodents without a license.
The recent Shire elections at Kingaroy gave Banana-
land its first woman councillor—Mrs. Kent-Wilson,
professionally known as Dr. Kent-Hughes.
Two more veteranesses passed out lately—Mrs. Dunn,
of Bluff View, Beaudesert, who had spent 64 of her
84 years in the State, and Mrs. Tannock, of Spring-
sure, who was nine short of the century and had lived
60 years in the Queensland bush.

Thanks to the committee’s skilful dealing
of the ten-and-sixperny cards, the crowd
which jazzed at Carlyon’s the other night
for St. Martin’s Boys’ Home was almost
as thickly creamed with the Best as if it
were a Toorak hop. Girl brigands, armed
with balloons, lilliputian paper-hats and
other cabaret baubles, netted a fine haul of
shillings. Miss Nyulasy, who had helped to
meet the production costs with a £35 cheque
from her recent home-made cafd chantant,
raked in another fiver by raffling the latest
American importation in black cats. Jennie
Brenan, a pleasing circumstance in sil-
ver sheathings under a mist of black
outlined with beaded floral effects, gave a
ballroom tango display with Ben Champion.
While the graceful intricacies of Jennie’s
footwork compelled admiration, the young
things present paled at the prospect of the
mental strain if the tango ever catches on.
Fox-trotting competition laurels were won
by Wilma Clarke and Leonard Quinn, who
lately scored a jazz victory on Bibron’s
dance-flpor. The supper was a simple meal, and
one thrilled at the sight of our most superiah
club-people nibbling German-sausage sand-
wiches, w r ashed dow r n with pale coffee.
The Russell Clarkes brought a party, and
Mrs. Leslie Stuart a schoolgirl chick to
see the sights. Big Bob Knox came as a
grass-widower. Mrs. Fred Kcrouse, the hon.
sec., set off her golden locks with inky hang-
ings. The Lauchie Mackinnons looked in,
and Judge Williams convoyed his wife and
daughter. Ainslie Verna Johnson flew
bugled trimmings on her tangerine draperies.
Mrs. Pat Levy, from Sydney, fluttered at-
tractively in a dazzle of black jet overlying
a maroeain sheath. Pat O’Hara Wood’s
mother and the Hale Morris widow helped
things along as assistant hon. treasurer and
assistant hon. sec.
Money does talk —sometimes when it ought
to hold its tongue. “A well-dressed woman,
who was thought to have been doped, was
found lying on a seat at Flinders-street sta-
tion,” a few nights ago. Nobody could tell
the policeman how she came to have beeu
lying there “some time.” She could give no
explanation at the watch-house —she had been
with friends, but knew not when she left
them or why she went to the railway sta-
tion. She carried a bagful of money, which
appeared to have been untouched ; a knitted
bag tied around her neck contained a £lOO
note, and several fine diamond rings were
still glittering on her fingers. When a police-
woman took this unaccountable case to “her
home in South Yarra” she still was as a
picture-show person who had been drugged.
No name or address was mentioned in the
newspaper report. This was fair enough.
But how would it have been with a shabbily-
dressed person, carrying ah empty bag and
destitute of diamond rings? Her identity
would have been revealed under the heading
of “The Mystery of a Muddled Matron.”
Publicity literally springs upon poverty in
petticoats when it is found stupefied on rail-
way-station platforms.
If Eggleston, member for St. Ivilda, lands
either the Premiership in a new team or a
good place in a reconstructed Lawson Min-
istry he will have to thank his wife for
charging him to hug ambition. In this re-
spect she resembles the wife of George
Turner, who was also member for St. Ivilda,
and, like Eggleston, a lawyer. But for his
home-ruler George might have been nothing
but Sam Lyons’s partner in a legal firm.
Spurred on by her he became member, Premier
and Federal Treasurer. With the track thus
blazed for him and a voice to cheer him on,
is it any wonder that Eggleston is asking
himself “Why not?”
Mrs. Arthur Baillieu spread an afternoon
at-home in the No. 9 Darling-street parlors
-to give Speaker Willie Watt and R. W. E.
Wilmot a chance to explain the workings of
the Melbourne Hospital Birthday League,
just launched to help solve the problem of
paying the hospital bills. Incidentally, Watt
made the forecast that a charity tax is the
only real solution. In the Melbourne alone
one thousand sick are treated every day.
This takes some paying for. Ray Tovell, as
hon. sec., got more than a hundred pro-
mises from the assemblage to pay 2s. Gd. and
upwards on their various birthdays, and
Arthur Baillieu dissipated an awful suspi-
cion that subscribers would be asked to state
the year of their birth on their cardlets, Mrs.
Baillieu, who received to the strains of soft
music, stood attractively in black marocam,
white-frilled at the collar and wrists, and
with a coque’s feather athwart her black
satin hat. Daughter Sunday was likewise
marocained in black, hers being livened by
a dash of Eastern color at her waist and on
her hat. The rooms were a riot of pink
flowers suggestive of an early Spring. Mrs.
Priminister Bruce was chief guest, with
the Miller, Best, Robinson, Tallis and
Mcßeath dames —Toorak, in fact, had turned
out in full strength. Mrs. Bowes Kelly, who
is much taken up these days with her in-
valid mother, looked in with a daughter and
uiece (Mrs. Percy Alderton). Mrs.
Hart got her first social outing after a ’flu,
attack. Mrs Reggie Wilmot came ■to hear
her hubby speak: the pair have again un-
packed in their Brighton homestead, after
some months in the near-by mountains with
their youngest girl, who recently parted with
her appendix.
’Flu has elected itself to the Federal
Parliament. Last week the genial roars of
old Jack West were temporarily stilled by
the disease—the veteran practically col-
lapsed and was hurried away to bed.
Stewart, Minister for Works, having just
beaten off one attack, is down again to a
flank movement from the same enemy.
Though Stewart has had a robust life as a
sailor, and farmer, among his fellow-Minis-
ters he looks like a lath in a row of barrels.
Dr. Nell Hughes (Mrs. Wilson in pri-
vate life), the first woman shire councillor
in Bananaland, is a daughter of Dr. Kent
Hughes, and a niece of Canon Ernest
Hughes, of Melbourne. She is a Bachelor
of Medicine and Master of Surgery of the
Melbourne ’Varsity, and has a sister,. the
good-looking Gwenda Hughes, who is. a
B.A. of the same shop. Before commencing
practice at Ivingaroy (Q.), where her hus-
band is a grazier, Dr. Hughes was in charge
of the Brisbane Children’s Hospital.
Lulu Montgomery, who looks forth from the
adjacent space, is, with her sister Marion, a
big gun of the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals Society, for which they raise an
annual cheque
with a young
people’s ball.

rather more than their bit for the Purple
Cross and various other organisations. Rem-
brandt made the photo.
The Western District flocked in for Gee-
long’s Waterloo Cup—declared to be the
only coursing event in the world which has
hit the £lOOO-prize mark. It was a wild,
wet week; but the heaviest downpour didn't
damp the general enthusiasm. The local
Race Club had bagged Wednesday; other-
wise it was a purely doggy occasion. Women
defied the seas of mud hemming in the race-
course (which was also the plumpton) with
golf-shoes or goloshes, and local garages and
char-a-banc cos. reaped much profit from
the wetness. President Guthrie convoyed big
parties to the grandstand on every coursing
day but Friday, when he answered an urgent
call to the Senate. Mrs. Guthrie, coated
and furred under a small black hat, brought
eight-year-old daughter Mary, whose ' dark-
eyed beauty shone above white furs. The
president and committee fed the special visi-
tors at daily lunch-parties. Sidney Smith,
Race Club sec. and chief organiser qf the
week’s carnival, turned out for each event;
Geelong’s Mayor and Mayoress were actively
interested, and all the squatter-heads were
asked to share the cold turkey and hotpot.
Big David Mack, who rules over the hare-
chasing competitions in S. Aus., came with
his wife. Dr. Stewart, last year’s Waterloo-
winner, was there also, with his wife, hop-
ing to see Vanity Verse secure him a second
victory; but the poor hound hurt itself in
the semi-final, and Dickie’s Unie got a walk-
over for the thousand. Mrs. Eric Russell,
who, so to speak, had put her boots on her
pup Rangiruru and lost, kept the damp out
with a yellow-leather coat and sporty grey
velour hat.
On Cup-cwm-Steeplechase afternoon, the
sun peeped flirtatiously through the clouds,
enabling the petticoated section to peel off
their encumbering wrappings and reveal their
best cloths and furs. Race-president Vincent
and his wife spread afternoon tea in a flower-
ing wattle-grove, where a newly-erected kiosk
came in handy as a tea-stall. All the best
people turned up, of course, although it
meant wading through lialf-an-acre of mud
to get there. Mrs. Vincent topped neat grey
tailorings with a black hat flying white
plumage; Mrs. Guthrie's blue-feathered toque
nested above a dark-green frock; Mrs. Jimmy
liussell was cosily furred and feathered oyer
navy tailorings; and Mrs. Sidney Smith
looked like a soft cloud in grey cloth hedged
in with fur, her head thatched with grey
velour banded with silver.
The Waterloo Cup Ball was held in the
Kindergarten Hall on Thursday night. The
building had been transformed into a Japan-
ese cherry-blossom grove. From the roof
dripped branches of pink flowers, interspersed
\frith lighted lanterns; more pinky branches
hummed the walls, and lotus lilies flowered
abundantly on the cherry-blossomed stage.
Clarice Taylor, who was king-pin among
the decorators, came in golden draperies
sandwiched between glittering panels. Mrs.
Guthrie's delicate fairness shone out from
misty black, but Mrs. Anderson lighted her
inky frdck with glistening jetted effects.
Mrs. Ormond Foster trailed red velvet dra-
peries encrusted with gold at the hems, and
little Mrs. Ted Chapman looked as if she
had stepped out of a French fashion-plate
in pinky watered silk demurely anchored
on the top storey with a well-pedigreed rose-
point berthe. Mrs. Jimmy Laing—the belle
of the ball —fluttered in gold tissue, which
had over-drapings of gold and green clamped
with flowers. Mrs. Newton-Lees sparkled
in black-jetted chiffon under the upturned
brim of a hat worn not for scenic effect but
to hide the brevity of her locks, which had
been shorn during a recent illness. Barbara
Hickie was an eye-filling figure in black
gladdened with a rope of amber, the ear-
rings to match. The Vincent, Salmon,
McKellar, Washington and Jimmy Russell
matrons all favored sombre coverings fur-
bished with jet. Floss Cox buttressed her
white marocain with a long lace pinny, while
Claire Salmon had monkey-fur hemming the
end of her pink silk. Mrs. Acton —who was
an English girl—was enveloped in a beauti-
ful cloud of blue. Several groups of matrons
fluttered bridge cards by a cosy fire, and
the committee had put aside another chamber
for conversational purposes. President
Guthrie and vice-president Harry Anderson
were capable hosts, who dealt severely with
any dull moment that threatened to intrude.
A practical little Western Districter,
Nesta McKeller, has decided to start out
early on her own account, and hopes to
make good with the lavender farm she has
lately aeqhired from the Tom Conrans, who
have helped to scent the country for miles
around with a profitable crop of fragrance.
Nesta’s parents own a desirable property,
Beil Park, not too many miles out of Gee-
long. The mother was one of the Tom
Gumming sisters. The girl’s family have
persuaded her to put a manageress in charge
of the lavender farm, and just pop in every
week-end or so until she has had a few more
birthdays.*
Widower Alfred Levey waited only to see
brother-in-law John Grice off the sick-list
before investing in a return ticket to Singa-
pore, where he will shelter with his younger
chick, Atholl. and her rubber-planting Robert
Renton. Alfred Levey has not been feeling
fit for some time, and it is thought a sea
voyage will build him up again.
There is something curiously appropriate
about an approaching shivoo in aid of the
Institute for the Blind. The employees of
Lincoln-Stuart’s are the of the
scheme. They are to hold at St. Ivilda Hail
a “Dance and bJalloon-squasliing competi-
tion.” Balloon-squashing should have charms
for any blind guests who may be invited.
Here’s a joke that one doesn’t need to see—
you can hear it. The competition ought to
.be funnier than a jazz band.
The almost-defunct debutante set was
re-staged at Essendon’s Mayoral whirl in
the Moonee Ponds Town Hall the other
night. Civic heads, with their feminine
halves, flocked in from every suburb for the
dance, which had a gorgeous decorative back-
ing, the work of local Town Clerk Cameron
and Gardens-Curator Oliver. Mayoress Gar-
rard stood by her man in misty grey weighted
with crystal and jet, and smiled over an
armful of pink flowers. The 16 debs, fluttered
whitely through a special square, all clasp-
ing pink posies given by their hostess. Mrs.
A. V. Hiskens sparkled in jet curtainings,
and Mrs. Tom Ryan, buttressed in red satin
clamped with jet, came with her political other
half. Little Mrs. Cameron trailed black
velvet, and Mrs. Stuart Brunton aired a
winner in bronze beaded fixings Over henna
marocain. Mrs. Craven toned up her black-
ness with a berthe of Brussels lace. Mrs.
Oliver’s blue-beaded tulle floated over gold
tissue; Mrs. Kinnear combined silver and
jade green with good results; and Mrs.
Kimpton shimmered like a black diamond in
jetted upholstery.
The late squatter John Campbell’s youn-
gest girl Helen, who tripped to the Cold
Land about three years ago with sister
Airlie, will now anchor herself there. Last
week she signalled that she has made a mat-
rimonial date with an ex-Sapper officer, Wil-
liam Seton Chevalier Anderson, second hope
of a London doctor. Mrs.,; Campbell, who
parted with her Toorak homestead, Ottawa,
after losing twm soldier sons and her hus-
band and elder daughter within the one
year, has squatted on a S’African farm near
her second daughter, Marion, whose ex-sailor
husband is said to be finding the land there
a paying proposition.
Flautist Leslie Barklam, here photoed by
Talma, is a talented member of a musical
family. Though only 15 he has annexed a
three-years’ scholarship at the ’Varsity Con.,
where one of
the Di Gilio
clan is train-
ing his lips in
the way they
should blow.
Previously the
boy was under
the care of the
popular W,es-
ton-Pett. who
added a few
floors to the
f o u ndationary
technique laid
down by the
assiduous John
Amadio. Both
of these bril-
liant teachers
get into a state
of warm pre-
diction when
Leslie’s name
is mentioned,
and Evelyn Scotney, who is no mean judge
of instrumentalists, thinks so highly of him
that she commandeered him and liis flute for
a cherished obbligato at the Town Hall a
while back.
S’Henry Parker’s elder unmarried daugh-
ters, who are launching out as- children’s
dress-builders, have opened the doors of the
South Yarra flat which will shelter their en-
terprise; and Toorak has turned up in shoals
to admire the exquisite needling and artistic
designing. The establishment undertakes to
“dress anything from 12 days to 12 years”
—unless woollies are asked for.
Carlyon’s ballroom is booked for the 28th
for a dance and bridge-party in aid of a
new church school at Deepdene. The tall
and stately form presiding over the com-
mittee is Mrs. Ben Hoare’s.
A little gossip from Adelaide: —
The Davidsons put in a few hours with the
Bridges at Government House on their way back
from Broken Hill, the Murrays and Railways Com-
missioner Webb and his wife being bidden to lunch
with them.
Lately there has been a series of small teas at
Government House (a sensible arrangement that
gives an incoming Governor’s wife a chance of
really getting to know people), and the other
evening Lady Bridges took a party of young things
off to enjoy themselves at the Winter Club.
The Girls’ Club, launched here by Lady Victoria
Buxton in the ’nineties, celebrated its 25th birth-
day at. its annual meeting this week, with Lady
Bridges and Bishop Thomas as the chief speakers.
The work is steadily increasing in size and scope,
but not in finance, and the committee would have
been in Queer-street but for the continued sale of
the Kookaburra Cookery Book. That useful volume,
published some years ago by Mrs. Percival Stow
(you’ll know her “Legendary Tales,” written when
she was K. Lang’oh Parker), has brought in nearly
£BOO to the funds, and still sells—nearly 4000
copies were bought this year.
A sheaf of good wishes goes from the old hands
to one man who figures in the last honors list—
Claud Severn, K.8.E., who lived with his aunt (Mrs.
Kennion) at Bishopscourt during the Kennion rOgime
and went as a small boy to St. Peter’s College. His
father was Walter Severn, the artist, whose picture
of Wells Cathedral was given by Bishop Kennion to
the Art Gallery ; a brother put in some hard work
here as a bush missioner before he went to a Somer-
setshire living. One of the new K.B.E.’s cousins,
also born in Adelaide, was the James Ferguson who
commanded the Thunderer at Jutland.
The Hunt C'ub’s supplementary meeting, moved
forward from November to July, took a smallish
crowd to Cheltenham, wherefore, from the feminine
point of view, the affair was all the pleasanter.
There was room to move, to see and be seen. Such
crowd as was there was mostly hunting and squatting
—Bowmans, MacFarlanes, Tennants, Mortloeks, Lux-
moores, Ayers, Stirlings and so on. The Bridges
turned up and strolled about informally in the pad-
dock and on the lawns with Miss Judge and Capt.
Hambleton. It was a gorgeous afternoon, but
the dressing was what has been almost a uniform
here this winter —coats and skirts with vast animal
skins slung about the shoulders and opulent-looking
coats of fur or of velour heavily trimmed with fur.
Furs and motors are apparently the trades that boom
in this village nowadays.
Mrs. Crozier, a daughter of the John Murray who
was one of the founders of the Murray merinos, and
widow of the William Crozier who once owned
Morna station on the big stream, died a few days
ago, aged 74. Hers was a kindliness that will be
missed; her hand helped many whose needs never
come under the ken of organised charity.
From Sydney comes news of the death of R. R-
Black, here for many years as manager of the Eastern
Extension Co. ; he married a daughter of the late
Alexander Patterson, M.D

DON'T WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
The running in the Leamington Hurdle at
Caulfield suggested that the long-distance event, over
the same ground, on August 4, will be fairly open.
Three of the first four in the Leamington—Mazax
(9st.), Gulyarri (9st.), Tarquil (9st. 121 b.), and
Roisel (list. 41b.) —have been left in the Australian
Hurdles, and the winner looks the least likely of the
three to stay the distance, whereas Roisel, with
a pound off his back, seems a reasonable proposition
for a “shop.” Gulyarri, despite his tiring at the
end of the Doutta" Galla at Flemington, will be
fancied on the supposition that he ought to justify
what was hoped of him before the National. During
the National week he was on the up-grade apparently,
and his final effort against Mazax was his best of
late. With only 9st. to carry this 6-year-old gelding
has a great opportunity, so, in a race unfavorable
to heavyweights, Gulyarri is bound to be much
fancied —fit and cheerful on the day. Within the
past 13 years eight winners have carried less than
10st., five of them being let in at under 9st. oib.
All the same, there was one year when none of the
placed horses humped less than lOst. 101 b.
Stonemarten, winner of the Godfrey Watson Steeple,
was not entered for the approaching Marathon at
Caulfield, and Oopina and Gold Coin, who followed
him home, will be weighted by years as well as
poundage in the long .struggle. Nor can anything
that finished behind them be seriously fancied.
“Fax”: The assumption that Haoma must
have won the Grand National Steeplechase but for
his falling at the third last fence strikes me as
being rather too complimentary to that free-going
little fellow. Granting an improvement in Haoma
since last year, it should be remembered that he
fell in the Australian Steeple of 1921, when leading
the field by a dozen lengths, and that last year in
the same race he slowed down rapidly after clearing
all the timber. Taking the final jump three lengths
ahead of Bright Maid he was beaten three lengths by
the mare, wno had run out wide at the turn into
the straight. She challenged the gallant pacemaker
below the distance and ran past him. At Caulfield
next month, all going well, Bright Maid will meet
Haoma on only a pound worse terms than before,
their respective rises in weight being ten to nine
pounds. Against this comes the argument that the
mare is two years older than the hot-headed son of
Persian Knight. Still, he is not necessarily a better
stayer now than the mare. Her blunder in the
National, which unshipped the jockey without bring-
ing her to grief, was the result of interference from
a riderless horse, so there is hope that she may
have another good go for the four-miles steeple at
Caulfield.
* * * *
“0.K.”: Some of those who backed Kun-
jolio for his Grand National merely followed the
breed. He and Pimpara were the only two Carbinier
offspring in the race, and the name of Carbinier
was formerly one to conjure with in long-distance
jumping races. Old Pimpara, at list. 81b., was
much less tempting than Kunjolio, at 9st., yet he
honored his father by standing up and finishing fifth.
The two grandsons of Carbine stood up, whilst
the two sons of Cooltrim —Liberate and Coolport—
fell. They were not of the true steepling breed.
Nor of the never-tire class, which is usually the
first class when the course is very muddy as well
as 25 furlongs in distance. The sires of the first
five in this National, where the favorites all came
to mother dirt, were Carbinier, Pendil, Tom Mooret,
Flagship and Carbinier again. All of them proved
sires of stayers, represented by old warrior sons.
The united ages of their progeny totted up to
51 years. The united ages of the five • favorites
—representing Cooltrim. White Knight, Persian
Knight and Venture—were only 31 years. You
need old, hard stuff for a soft, long road in
Flemington steeplechases.
The result of the Lawn Handicap at Flem-
ington the other Saturday was probably unexampled
in Australian racing. Newmarket Handicap winners
finished first and second. Old Blue Cross fought it
out with Sunburst, of whom a Melbourne daiiy paper
had the face to remark that his victory, four months
after his previous appearance with the colors up,
proved the fallacy of the argument that gallops
in public are required to “sharpen a horse up.”
The dailies for years have been persistent advertisers
of the “sharpening-up” guff, whilst The Bulletin
has been girding at it ever since the days of Revenue,
who won the Melbourne Oup, at 2 to 1, afteil an
absence from the turf of about 18 months.
* * * *
“Chiron”: Every punter agrees with
“Joseph Andrews” about the poor quality of the
Tasmanian racehorse and the Government’s excessive
cut from the tote (B. 5/7/’23). But it isn’t true that
“since the extra 24 p.c. was imposed not one meeting
has shown a profit.” The N.R.C'. has held two
meetings since the obnoxious imposition, and has
declared a profit of £123. The T.A.J.C. cleared
£44 and three trotting clubs are wealthier by £l5O.
As it's causing quite a stir in the Speck, let’s have
it correct.
* * * *
“E.F.” : Racecourse punters have an odd
habit of smothering meat-pies, frankfurt sausages,
and even ham sandwiches with tomato sauce. An
eager fondness for sauce is the distinguishing char-
acteristic of those who go to the temperance bar for
a light standing lunch. You find the same tendency
among patrons of the luncheon rooms, but not to
the same extent as among stable lads and inveterate
racegoers of older growth, who are living (or “do-
ing themselves in”) on the game. This weakness
for tomato sauce possibly originated in the custom
of taking something from a bottle at other bars,
where tea and coffee are not on tap. Anyhow, sauce
is the only thing punters can get from a bottle at
some of the racecourse luncheon-stands, and they
do go at it with a will. My little book of “bird-
cage” statistics tells me that nearly 75 per cent, of
customers at the tea-and-coffee counter are addicted
to tomato sauce.
“Rio” : My experience of polo being limited
to looking on, I’m content to accept what “Maidan”
(B. 12/7/’23) says about British and Australian
horsemanship. Still, the same sort of criticism was
levelled at our cricket, football, rowing and tennis,
until Australia silenced it by repeated victories.
There is one point that mystifies me: Why is it
that British players nearly always ride with a
double rein and curb, while Australians almost
invariably use a light single rein snaffle? Inciden-
tally, I’ve seen a squadron Of Light Horse gallop
and keep their formation through bush that British
and Indian cavalry-officers declared impossible for
mounted troops at any pace.
“Rusty Face”: “Maidan” asserts that polo-playing
Australians, “of the squatting class,” are poor
riders compared with British and Indian officers.
It may be so, but could “Maidan” persuade the
cleverest English horseman of his acquaintance to
come to Greenmount (Q’land), and ride the ranges
beside Jack Allen, the mighty hitter of the Cress-
brook combination, he would have to bring a chaff-
bag with him to carry home “Choom’s” remains.
The Yic. Waterloo Cup was worth £lOOO
and a £25 bauble to the winning owner and £3OO
to the owner of the runner-up, £540 being divided
among the proprietors of other dogs. This distribu-
tion was made possible by 128 hopeful sports from
three States contributing £lO 10s. apiece. Vanity
Verse, last year’s winner, was favorite, Dr. Stewart
and his friends backing her for a substantial stake
at 12’s. The doc. took £lOOO to £BO in one hand.
He could have laid it off at a great profit before
the final, his bitch having won her six with
ease. The betting on the final was 5 to 1 on Vanity
Verse; 4 to 1 against Unie. But as luck would
have it, the bitches hadn’t raced 40 yards after
their hare when the favorite broke down (she dis-
located a joint in one of her hind legs), and Unie
landed the stake and some nice wagers at 25’s for
her owner, C. Dickie, of Bacchus Marsh. Dickie
bred both bitches, oddly enough.
Oscar Asche had a dawg in the Oup (it was
knocked out in the first round) and Senator Guthrie
didn’t miss a contest. The game has fascinated Guthrie
since he was a boy in knickerbockers. At 16 he
pawned a gift watch to enter a dog for a match,
and won. He is president of the Vic. Coursing Club.
“0.K.” : The coursing at Geelong reminded me of
an old sport who dated his downfall from the day
when Fate played him a dirty trick in a match.
Up to then he had “made a bit of money by
keepin’ a good grey’oun’ or two, and running ’em a
bit in an’ out, as y’ may say.” This was in Eng-
land. On the sad occasion he told me of he had
overfed his best dog and laid against it with a con-
fidence born of the conviction that it must get beat.
But whilst straining in the slips the “stuffed” tripe-
hound brought up his ill-timed dinner. The other
dog ate it and —but why pursue a painful subject?
-Tim Paddon, the Evans Head (N.S.W.)
fisherman, is still world’s champion sculler as a
result of his race with Darcy Hadfield, of
M.L., on the Richmond River. Better suited by
the choppy water, he gained a lead in the first
minute, was six lengths ahead at two miles, and re-
tained that advantage to the end, the finishing time
being 19min. 9sec. Hadfield rowed a plucky race,
and was less distressed than his conqueror at the
finish, but he never looked like winning. His fellow-
Maorilander, Archie Sharpe, also suffered a reverse
over the same course, Goodsell, the ex-amateur,
defeating him by half-a-length in 19min. 14sec.
But Sharpe put in a great finish when all seemed
lost, and it was no disgrace for any man to be beaten
by the Digger, whom the old brigade regard as a
coming champion.

Although Pancho Villa bowled Mendies
over in three rounds at Manila a year or two ago,
the little Sydney pug. would have plenty of hacking
if it came to a return match. On Saturday he
knocked out Harry Gordon 20 seconds after the
beginning of the fifth round of their Sydney Stadium
fight. Gordon —-a bantam, and half-a-stone heavier —
was groggy at the end of the first. But he recovered
quickly and momentarily looked like a winner in
the fourth, when he had Mendies down for “six.”
However, the first punch after the minute’s spell
settled it —and him.

“Jumbo”: Arthur Cripps, once middle-
weight champion of Australia, recently called on
the Queensland Minister of Railways with a mob of
Nanango settlers seeking an extension of their rail-
way. Except that his head is bald, Arthur looks
as young and vigorous as when he used to knock
out the Thompsons and Murphys. He has been, in
turn, butcher, footballer, pugilist, dairy-farmer and
scldier. Nowadays he bosses the Post Office Hotel at
Nanango, and there is no chucker-out on the wages
sheet.
“Snow” : The only time I saw Peter Felix
really ferocious (B. 19/7/’23) was when he fought
Jack Johnson at the old Sydney Gaiety. After they
had shaken hands, Jack advanced with a grin on
his massive dial, and threw a left into Peter’s mid-
riff. Down went Peter. He was so wild that he
hugged the floor venomously and refused to leave it
till his seconds dragged him away.

“Linesman” : The Australian Lawn Tennis
Association has cabled a protest against its Davis
Cuppers playing the Ilawaiians on a Sunday. It
is professedly shocked at the notion of amateurs
gambolling about the courts on the Sabbath for a
“gate,” but one doubts whether it will carry its
objection to the point of refusing its whack of the
takings. If the Association considers that a match
on the Sabbath is distasteful to popular Australian
sentiment, which I doubt, why not have postponed
its opinion on the question until after the battle?
Anderson, who agreed to the arrangement obviously
little expecting a snort from this side, will go into
that encounter next Sunday feeling that he hasn’t the
Association’s moral support ; and everyone knows
what a temperamental young man he is.' If, by any
chance, he is beaten on the holy day—which by the
way, is a regular day of recreation among New Jer-
sey citizens —our tennis authorities will doubtless
regard the result as a judgment from Aloft.
Fred Popplewell owns the professional golf
championship of N. S. Wales, for what it is worth.
D. G. Soutar led on the first day’s play at Rose Bay
with a card of 154 against Popplewell’s 156 ; but
Popplewell went round next morning in 74 against
Soutar’s 79. That decided it, albeit Soutar did the
final round in 79 against Popplewell’s 81, and was
only one stroke behind at the end. The winner’s
aggregate was 311. In the amateur v. pro. matches
the lilywhites won the foursomes, 3 games to 1; but
the pros, were superior in the singles, 7 games to 6.
Popplewell went down in both matches —in the
singles to H. R. Sinclair and in the doubles (with
A. B. Chitty) to Sinclair and Thompson.

The amateur golf championship of South
Australia was the easiest of wins for Legh Winser,
the holder, by 10 up and 9 to play from Cheadle,
Who also has held it several times since his first
success, as a schoolboy, 20 years back. The other-
six who “qualified” were Nott, Swift, Jay—all
doctors —Forbes, Giles and Parsons ; and Nott took
Cheadle to the 22nd hole in a semi-final. The
golf championship of Australia will be played in
Adelaide next month. S.A. has high hopes for
•Winser, a rattling good man when in form.

“Sprocket”: Partly because track and
road cyclists are to be included in the Olympic
IDEAL FOR THE JOB.
THE CAPTAIN : “ ’Grace ’ere will ’are to be umpire. ’E don’t
know much about the rules, but if ’e ain’t din hum we can
all stoush ’im."
Games team, Victoria is experiencing another cycling
boom. Last week the annual inter-club road cham-
pionships were begun, the seniors travelling 10 miles
and the'colts half that distance. In the former race
Carlton Amateurs displaced South Melb. (last year’s
premiers), and, incidentally, gave the record-book a
jolt. Jack Milne, a 20-vear-old comer, won the final
sprint and was clocked to do the tenner in 24min.
20sec., which easily dislocated the 25min. 50sec.
established by Bill denyns (Northern Suburbs). Also,
the Carlton team’s time (24min. 20sec.) put out of
action the 24min. 37sec. made by Northern Suburbs
over the Epping course in 1921. In the five-miler
Eric Stevens, a 16-year-old brother of Bowie Stevens,
the pro. track and road rider, registered 12min.
2 4-ssec., breaking the Victorian senior record of
12min. 43 1-sec. made by Bill Jenyns on Aug. 20,
1912. A great ride for a nipper.
’Flu ended the career of Albius McAlister,
in his day a fine all-round athlete and holder of
Commonwealth jumping records, high and long.
Though resident at Goulburn (N.S.W.), Albi was
an active, member of the Glebe Harriers, and the
double 130-miles journey from Goulburn to the
Glebe was a week-end diversion. He was 50 when
the final pistol cracked.
* * * *
Frank Burge, the great Glebe forward,
came back for one match on Saturday to help his
old club against South Sydney, and, incidentally,
to collect a testimonial, Glebe having guaranteed
him a minimum of £lOO out of the “gate.” So
long as his condition lasted, Burge played splendidly,
but South Sydney were too swift for the Glebers and
collected all the points—lo to nil. Burge is the
man most sought after by English clubs before the
tw 7 o years’ residential qualification was reimposed.
His friends are remarking on the fact that an
inferior ground w 7 as allotted for his benefit, but the
League protests its flower-like innocence. St. George
gave North Sydney a lot of trouble, but last year’s
premiers, with Blinkhorn and Horder back in the
team, emerged winners by 20 points to 16. They are
still level with South and Eastern Suburbs for the
premiership.
“Centurion”: An ingenuous young man,
styled “Our University Correspondent,” is filling space
in Sydney dailies with a proposal that the rival Uni.
football clubs should amalgamate and play the
League game. He has the gall to assert that the
League team is as good as, if not superior to, the
Union combination. The fact is that you couldn’t
handicap them together. The Union side has worthily
maintained the reputation of one of the most famous
University clubs in existence. Since the ’seventies
this club has many times been premiers of N. S.
Males and has regularly contributed great players
to Australian and British representative teams. This
season alone, eight Union men were included in the
matches against the Maoris. The Union team is
leading the amateur competition; the League side
adorns the foot of the professional table. What
inducement, then, is there for the Union men to
play with professionals, and so cut Rhodes scholars
and others going to British foundations right out of
amateur sport? None whatever; but it is mani-
festly desirable that the League youths should
abandon their futile strivings against professional
thirteens (so far this season they have lost nine of
the ten matches played) and return to their old love.
* * * *
St. Joseph’s defeat of Sydney Grammar
by 18 to nil virtually decided the G.P.S. premier-
ship. The match was witnessed by 8000 excited
fathers, brothers and sisters, with Gov.-Gen. Forster
in the front row, bobbing about like a cork in a
gale.
South Melbourne, coached by the shrewd
Pannam, are improving. On Saturday they ran rings
round Fitzroy until near the final bell. Then the
Maroons made a fierce effort to snatch victory and
failed by 4 points—s 6 to South’s 60. Carlton,
objecting to being pushed out of “the four,” bogged
in recklessly against St. Kilda, and struck trouble,
one of the Blues cracking his collar-bone and tw 7 o
others having to retire. Saints also acquired minor
casualties, but not enough to stop them winning by
56 points to Carlton’s 47. Essendon, on their home
ground, walloped Gollingwood by 91 to 51. The
Magpies, weakened by injuries, made a good showing
up to half-time, but they couldn’t stop Stockdale, who
kicked seven goals. Geelong made a hash of Mel-
bourne, 75 points to 56, but as neither has any chance
for the finals only enthusiasts concerned themselves
with the matter.
* * * *
“Tren”: Melbourne’s best-remembered in-
stance of torn-pants humor (B. 19/7/’23) occurred
long ago in a match be-
tween Albert Park and
Carlton. Five thousand
spectators stood in the
slush of Royal Park and
cheered the teams on. It
was a dreary business,
however, for with 36 of
the 40 oafs on the bail,
play was confined for long
periods to one spot. The
tedium was broken when
one of the Alberts, in a
noble effort to win tho
match single-handed, grab-
bed the ball and tried to
fight his way through the
crush. For a minute he
was enveloped. When the
mob surged ,on without
him he was as Providence
sent him into the world,
plus boots and stockings.
With a look of agony cn
his muddy phiz he threw
himself flat on the ground
and called for an overcoat.
Unluckily for him the bar-
rackers in the vicinity
were Carltonians, of a
humorous turn of mind.
Instead of covering his
nakedness with a garment
they pelted him with mud
and small stones until in
desperation lie had to run
for it to the cabs. Dress-
ing--rooms were then un-
known (players changed at
a favorite pub in the home
suburb), so the muddy
fellow 7 had to sit clothed
only in a trainer’s overcoat,
until, hours later, the team reached Albert Park.
South Australia took on more than it
could manage when it tackled two other States at
football on the one day. Its second XYIII were
beaten on the Adelaide ground by the South Tas-
manians, who played uncommonly good football. The
first XVIII went to Perth, expecting to repeat thei r
last month’s victory over the Westralians, but a
changed Groper side, trained by the old-timer Phil
Matson, extinguished their hopes by 91 points to 27.
A crowd of 18,000 paid £1263 to see the slaughter.
Adelaide sportsmen are a long-lived lot.
The Reoister has dug up in its 50-years-old column
the formation of Kensington Oval, on which inter-
state football was played for some years, it being-
thought that football on the Adelaide Oval would
damage the turf too much for cricket. And of the
committee chosen for Kensington half-a-century ago
Herbert Phillipps, Bay Moulden, Tom Pope and
Arthur Bonney are still going strong, though the
control of the Oval long since passed into other
hands.
* * * *
“Machete”: Our old friend Ranjitsinghi
has a nephew who is threatening to revive the famih
cricket traditions. He is K. S. • Dhulupsinghi and is
captain of Cheltenham, Adam Lindsay Gordon’s old
school. Last season he took over 50 wickets, and he
made a good start this year with a century against
Cheltenham town. Though few people know it, Ranii
himself was a bowler of very decent quality, though
he chose to concentrate on batting. * •
A BALLADE OF FORBIDDEN SNAPS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The English Lawn Tennis Association is taking
action to prevent photographers from securing snap-
shops of lady tennis-players with their legs in the
air.
Take tale-telling kodaks away
To scenes more Arcadian than these.
Snap Naiads their charms that display,
Clad lightly from necks unto knees,
In surf on the fringe of the seas;
But, wielders of cameras, ’ware
How you train them on tennis-ing Shes
With legs that are flung in the air 1
High-kicker and feat coryphee
For pictures that thrill you may seize,
Or limbs that seductively sway
Around an aerial trapeze;
E’en hockey’s long-haired devotees
As they gallop and smack you may snare.
But keep from the tennis-courts, please,
Where legs are a-whirl in the air,
Dianas in hunting array
Astride of impetuous gees
Remain your legitimate prey ;
And Junos with clubs upon tees
In skirts that are flapped by the bi'eeze
Are game for photography fair.
But it’s diff’rent on lawns and on leas
When legs are a-cleaving the air.
Envoy.
For studied and elegant ease,
Say, how can an Artemis care
When racquets are humming like bees
And legs are careering through air ?

Bishop Gilbert White, who knows the
Farthest Outback as few Gaiters have ever
done, finds it in his big heart to say a word
for the back-country Bung: “A man who
can stand all day and most of the night the
utterly meaningless oaths and blasphemy of
the habitual drunkard, and his thousandfold
meaningless reiterations of the same sense-
less story or argument, must be possessed of
a patience greater than that of Job.”
“Gnarek”: There was to be an organ
recital, and the parson asked the organist to
submit his programme prior to the perform-
ance in order that nothing secular might
be played upon the sacred instrument. The
proof was returned with the request that
something more edifying should replace
"Romance in A Flat.” The organist is still
wondering what thoughts were in that par-
son’s mind.
“Geo. Rich”: Some of the Vic.-N.S.W.
surplus medicoes might pick up a crust in
Westralia. A number of country districts
in the big State are absolutely doctorless,
partly because of the superior attractions
of the city for the profesh, and partly be-
cause Perth Uni. doesn’t turn out medical
men. In several of the country districts
the Government allows the M.O.—-when
there is one—£loo a year for attending to
"prisoners and natives,” although more often
than not there’s neither to attend to.
"S.A.W.”: Ex-State Commandant Bee
(B. 21/6/’23) is not the only professional
man interested in the lucrative business of
oyster farming at Port Stephens (N.S.W.).
To my knowledge there are three doctors,
three solicitors, two dentists, two bank
managers (retired), one chemist, two sur-
veyors—and quite an interesting list besides,
including one member of Australia’s aris-
tocracy. Incidentally, Port Stephens boasts
the largest public oyster concern in the
southern hemisphere—the Commonwealth
Oyster Co.
J. J. Liston, Bung’s Grand Vizier in Vic.,
who is already Mayor of Williamstown, has
been elected to the City Council for Smith
Ward. At the declaration of the poll he
snorted at an anti-Liquor League circular with
the name of Greenwood, M.L.A., at the foot.
The following day Greenwood said he hadn’t
seen the circular until Liston’s growl was
reported. It was usual to append his name
as president, he explained; but in this in-
stance, ‘‘through an oversight,” the docu-
ment was not submitted to him. And now
Melbourne is chuckling at the idea of the Antis
treating their mighty E.W.G. as a cypher.
‘‘Allbutt”: The N. S. Wales Railway De-
partment has been stimulated into improving
its service by the motor opposition on the
Tamworth-Barraba line, and the public is
getting the benefit. With a length of 60
miles the tri-weekly mixed service used to
take nearly seven hours, and often the only
people aboard were the train crew. With
the introduction of a daily motor-train the
journey is made in well under three hours.
The passenger-list has increased till in some
cases the accommodation is proving insuffi-
cient for requirements. The motor co. has
substantially reduced its tariff in an endea-
vor to compete, but the railway has regained
most of the passenger traffic, and there is
even talk of the line paying its way.
“Ashmead”: Ever since it started the
Speck Government’s shipping venture has
shown a loss, which is becoming a serious
drain on the revenue. One reason is that
the private cos. have always anticipated the
arrival of a State boat at a port and skimmed
the cream off the loading, leaving the public’s
own hookers to take half-cargoes or none
at all. Another cause of trouble is that
the manager of the line has been stationed
in Hobart. Wire-pulling by those bent on
concentrating Government activities at the
capital have kept him there, when he should
obviously have been at Launceston, the
centre from which the fleet radiates. Autho-
rity has at last been given for headquarters
to be shifted.
“Cresar’s Ghost”: Australia never had an
other adapter of plays like Alfred Dampier.
When Alfred had finished adapting the ori-
ginal author wouldn’t have recognised his
creation. For this reason, among others,
—Dampier had a, genial habit of distri-
buting all the “fat” among his not very
talented progeny. Members of the co. not
belonging to the family got the leavings. On
the walls of some Australian theatres there
are still notices warning the profession
against infringing Dampier’s rights in “Rob-
bery Under Arms,” “For the Term of. His
Natural Life.” “East Lynne,’l “Camille” and
—yes, “The Merchant of Venice.” In type
so small that you can hardly read it follows
the legend, “Alfred Dampier’s version.”
“F. Clinton” : Just before war broke out
the N.S.W. Government purchased in
Switzerland a number of good pedigreed milk-
ing goats and a few billies. There was some
difficulty in getting them shipped, goats not
being particularly desirable travelling com-
panions, but eventually a German vessel lifted
the livestock. When she put into Capetown,
on her , way to Australia, she was seized as
an enemy vessel and her crew interned. The
S’African Department of Agriculture ar-
ranged to look after the goats until they
could be sent. During the detention the
flock increased considerably, but when, after
long delay, the original consignment reached
Australia, there was not one kid among it.
Somebody in South Africa had got away
with the lot.
“X2X”: There is good reason for think-
ing that illicitly-made spirits have been
pushed into both Sydney and Melbourne in
fairly large quantities. The stuff, which is
retailed mostly in the least reputable pubs,
is probably made within easy reach of the
cities. In N. S. Wales the South Coast towns
and the bush around Newport and Broken
Ray are believed to be the favorite locations.
The local “hooch” is turned out in small
lots; large quantities of “mash” cannot be
fermented or distilled without too conspicu-
ous vats and tanks. The retailers get it at
£2 or £2 10s. a gallon. As it goes straight
from manufacturer to consumer, “ageing” is
out of the question, and the liquor conse-
quently contains all the higher alcohols,
known generically as fusel oil. This
“whisky” has a bitter, burning taste, and is
likely to affect seriously the heart, brain,
liver and other organs. The high price of
genuine spirits is the factor mainly respon-
sible for the reviving of this industry. The
Customs Department has offered a reward
of £lOO for information leading to the dis-
covery of a still, so far without success.

Why
Pioneer Leather Belting
is Better.
1. —Made from leather tanned in onr own tanneries specifically for
belting use.
2. —Greater tensile strength—and therefore best for heavy drives.
8. —Superior grip—less loss of power through slippage.
4. —Longer wear—many still in use after ten, fifteen and twenty
years.
5. —Reliability—minimum of time lost through repairs and break-
downs.
For these reasons Pioneer Leather Belting has been selected by Australia’s
foremost engineers for use in many of Australia’s largest mining, industrial
and manufacturing plants.
An instance of this is the enormous biscuit-making plant of William
Arnott, Ltd.
The main power-house at Arnott’s Homebush factory generates 800 h.p.,
which is distributed throughout the factory almost exclusively by Pioneer
Leather Belting. The illustration shows a small section of the plant,
where the dough is rolled, preparatory to cutting and baking.

Curtains drawn aside, revealing
Girls in all respects appealing ;
Changing scenes and color-scheming,
Artful aids to Love’s young dreaming;
Lots of limbs in rhythm twirling;
Sisters Pounds, whose worth is sterling,
Clad in raiment rich, beguiling ;
Drapes that check unholy smiling;
Women, wonder-struck and gasping,
Hands in agitation clasping;
Eve’s eyes straining at their sockets —
“ROCKETS!”
Ancient gags in modern dresses;
Wigs that camouflage as tresses,
Snips whereof are kept in lockets.
“ROCKETS!”
Mimic railway cars at stations;
Wines and wicked invitations;
Silkeh tights and subtle poses,
Whitened teeth and powdered noses.
Banish Thought, which fools get lost in,
Whilst you grin at Charley Austin.
Entertainments smart and funny
Dope the mind and draw the money,
Scatter care, excite the senses.
Pay the cost, and hang expenses!
Laughter makes the liver active;
Meet the bill that’s most attractive
(Playhouse bills are ne’er called dockets) —
Dip your hands into your pockets.
“ROCKETS!”

Harry Lauder, never more jovial than
when he recalls the purple heather of his
youth, is reviving the “Saftest o’ the Family”
at Melbourne King’s. The figure o’ the only
Lauder has thickened somewhat since he in-
troduced the saftest to us nine years ago,
but in other respects the boy is young as
ever. Tom Payne and Vera Hilliard have
found favor in their variety turn, which con-
cludes with a singularly humorous dance;
likewise the deft Ivavanagh, who juggles with
■clubs and rubber balls more cleverly than
most other members of the craft, and the
lady who melts in a colored maze of magic-
lantern effects. The nichts of Lauder are
numbered until August 2, the new co. from
England being due on the 4th.
At Melbourne Royal the pantomimic drama
of “The Cat and the Canary” is meeting
with all the success it deserves, or even less.
Which remark can be trusted to disexplaiu
itself, while leaving much to the imagination.
The doleful Hoodoo Woman is still Eily
Malyon in private life, grandfather’s clock
continues to go again when encouraged, the
death-gong has lost nothing of its nonsense,
and the clutching hand maintains its fervor.
MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Harry Lauder in “Doughie, the Baker,” and
“When I was Twenty-one.”
Confused memories of “La Tosca,” soft-
ened by recollections of “Sign of the Cross,”
are awakened by the second act of “Sybil,”
at Melbourne Majesty’s, when Grand Duke
Flemming betrays symptoms of a disposition
to chase the prima donna around a room m
the Governor’s palace. One expects Gladys
Moncrieff to have to brandish a dagger and
cry "You cannot harm me note,” but for-
tunately the Grand Duke remembers in time
that he’s a royal gentleman, and noblesse
oblige. Bolshevism makes one almost regret
that such grand-dukes are done with in Rus-
sia. Constantine is quite a decent person-
age considering his position, lie makes him-
self very nice to Chisholm when things are
fully explained, and under his suave influ-
ence Chisholm is abating some of his aggres-
siveness in speech, and is: not now so much
the sort of young man who used to be called
an “angry boy” in rare Ben Jonson’s time.
* * * *
“Tangerine,” at Melbourne Princess’s, is
all the better for some new furnishings of
the Alimony Jail-room in’ New York, where
this weird romance of marriage and divorce
gets its send-off. “Tangerine” remains the
same old feast of garish coloring in its after
scenes, and the neck of the island king still
refuses to wring. The charm of Mamie Wat-
son is always in her refined air of happiness
on the stage, and the fault of Ireland Cutter
is in his perfunctory treatment of details
when he is not making himself obvious.
At Melbourne Tivoli a smart comedy
sketch, with a moral to it, is well staged by
Alan Brooks and co. Four characters in
as many changes of scene present the case
of a costly little feminine thing, an adoring
husband and his friend Jack. While Jack
discovers the expensive selfishness of the
spoilt darling, her husband is left to wallow
in his fond illusions. The story being purely
American, the dialogue deals largely with
dollars, stocks and telephone messages. Ruby
Norton’s song of Sunshine Alley is conclud-
ing this week, and one or more of the other
turns could be better spared.
* # *
Melbourne Majestic has a cure for wintry
melancholy this week in “Bell Boy 13.”
wherein Douglas McLean is an imp of mis-
chief producing situations of uproarious
humor. “Fortune’s Mask,” the follow-on,
carries the film-fan into Central America
and makes him acquainted with an O. Henry
plot. Hoyt’s invite attention to “Adam's
Rib,” an elaborate fiction that pretends to
discuss deeply whether the modern woman
is any different from the original Eve. There
is some good sob-stuff in “The Dangerous
Age,” which is Hoyt’s current romance at the
Gaiety, but the conclusion is a triumph of the
expected. At the Melba the cocaine habit
and the demoralising sagacity of Sherlock
Holmes are pictured by John Barrymore
with great applause. “Theodora” is the sen-
sation at the Britannia, and the wealth of
bare flesh and hungry lions is keeping many
people away from home.
An interesting concert comes due at Mel-
bourne Assembly Hall next Tuesday night.
Myndelle Isaacs is to be the songstress, and
Gertrude Healy and William Burrell will
offer the violin and piano solo. Miss Isaacs
has a sweetly sympathetic soprano that testi-
fies to the excellent local teaching of the
Madame whom Melbourne of old knew as
Alice Rees.
About a man who has improved :—-
F. G. Reynolds, whom onel remembers as a prolific
producer of dull landscapes, shows at the Melbourne
Athenseum that he has benefited by a trip to Britain.
The improvement is not so marked in his water-
colors, which, with the exception of a brilliant view
of translucent sea-water, still incline to express
muddily an unambitious intention. The real jump in
performance is in his oils of sombre English scenery
under lowering skies. An outstanding example is
“Elm Trees, Pinchbeck, Lincolnshire” (No. 85), le-
velling a competence almost incredible in contrast
with earlier Australian landscapes' which the artist
hangs near-by, apparently for the derisive exposure
of his Past. Two studies of large, billowy beeches
and a “Grey Day” (No. 92), have an equal charm,
and they make one wonder why an artist, so deft
in catching transitory atriiospheric effects and in
revealing all the quiet beauty of the English country-
side, should dedicate large canvases to the ragged
fragments of Corfe and other castles without achiev-
ing anything of definite artistic interest. Some of
the painting in these is little better than mapping,
and the feeling inspiring them is pure sentimentality.

Lee White and her merry maids change
their frocking about eight times nightly at
Sydney Royal. Lee herself runs through the
whole scale, from the high doh of an Island
Queen, in which she is robed in what looks
like the first cousin to the Town Hall cande
labra, to the modest doh of a New England
school-marm. The girls are all right; and
a new lass with a sweet voice threatens to
evolve into a head-liner.

Gertrude Elliott and her very capable Eng-
lish co. will pass from Penseroso to Allegro
on Saturday night at Sydney Cri., and the
tense and sobful atmosphere of “Woman to
Woman” give way to the liveliness of “Enter,
Madame,” the comedy that London audiences
found a merry rib-tickler.

At Sydney Opera House “Bulldog Drum-
mond” retains its grip on public approval.
G. 11. Mulcaster is a debonair hero, and the
rush of crowded hours and moving accidents
and thrilling deeds is fully worth the money
plus the tax.
“Mary” trips and lilts along pleasingly
enough at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. There’s
not much “body” in the vintage, as it were,
and the melody is a trifle thin and reedy, but
the dancing is' gay and gladsome.
MELBOURNE KING'S.
Two impressions of Tom Payne, who was
last in Australia with the ‘‘Miss Hook
of Holland” co. ten years ago.
As a caterer for the bhoys and colleens,
Allen Doone is evergreen. Before a homely
and Hibernian audience at the Sydney
Palace last Saturday the Yankee-Irish barn-
stormer-manager introduced “In Old Don-
egal,” his third and final revival for this sea-
son. Bucolic virtue as revealed by a rich
shamrock brogue gains the old triumph over
villainy with spondulix and a superiah Eng-
lish tone; and, as usual, Doone was kept
from his supper by having to render an
Irish patriotic air as an after-curtain encore.
# * * *
Billed as “a vaudeville surprise,” Itistori
and an unnamed partner, who really ought to
give some Salv’army lasses lessons on the
tambourine, score this week’s bull’s-eye at
Sydney Tivoli. But there isn’t much of a
surprise about it; Ristori plays his violin
while throwing somersaults, and the saifi
partner capers in the background with the
also-said tambourine. Little Billy does
nothing to earn a headline; nevertheless a
recitation about an impounded pet dog
fetches some sobs from the gallery. Morris
and Kuming, patter artists, deserve a men-
tion ; and Eileen and Marjorie continue their
remarkable acrobatics. As usual, the St.
Leon Trio work hard. Some alleged high
jumps nearly spoilt James Teddy’s reputa-
tion, but he partially retrieved it by striking
matches in a colleague’s face with the soles
of the feet —a thing State Treasurer Cocks
couldn’t do to save his life.
One-half of the Sydney Lyceum pro-
gramme this week is occupied by a cinema
man’s impression of the fauna and flora of
the land where Stanley discovered Dr. Liv-
ingstone. A Jumbo run amok and some inti-
mate close-ups of rhinoceroses are much more
entertaining than the insinuating leer of the
suave lounge lizard who has locked the door
on the heroine. “More to be Pitied,” the
other half of the Lyceum’s bill, is an epic
wherein marriage-licenses and death-certifi-
cates are shuffled bewilderingly. -At the
Strand “Polly with a Past” converts herself,
with disastrous results to a deaconess’s beau ;
and the giggle is provided by a new humorist,
who might be Fatty Arbuckle’s twin brother.
The Globe has banished “The Christian” and
now offers “Souls for Sale,” founded on
Hughes’s book about movie life with
none of the warts painted * in. The
Crystal Palace is building up a big
bank balance with Doug. Fairbanks and
Enid Bennett in “Robin Hood.” It is a very
good sample of the picture-maker’s art —or
artifice, whichever you like. Stadium fans
are putting their off-nights in at the Empress,
where “Two-fisted Jefferson” is a nasty cus-
tomer to run up against. Hoyt’s are receiv-
ing patronage by virtue of a dashing pair,
“Lovebound” and “The Prisoner.”
Adelaide was at first inclined to stay away
from “Quarantine” at the Royal, having
heard that it was too strong to be pleasant;
but, later, the crowds came in, finding it quite
inoffensive though mischievous. Grossmith
is quietly effective all through. The main
work falls on Dorothy Seacombe, who is a
great find: she has the advantage of looking,
as well as acting, the big, reckless, lovable
kid that the heroine of this unconventional
farce must have been. Ashton Jarry puts up
an odd bit of work in this play ; he pervades
it, yet has only one word to speak, and is
not even named on the programme. Other
shows are nicely varied. The York has
made the stupendous jump from the Queen
of Sheba to the Sentimental Bloke, who, by
the way, is about to appear also in the flesh
on the stage of the Royal.
“C.R.8.”: Alexander Wooleott, the vet-
eran dramatic critic of New York Times,
in a recent book recalls the first appearance
of Olga Nethersole in America, where she
was summed up by Franklin Adams thus:—
1 love little Olga,
Her plays are so warm,
And if I don’t see them
They’ll do me no harm.
That is a good one, but a better was scored
by Heywood Broun, also of New York, when
Wedekind’s “Friihlings Erwaehen” (Spring’s
Awakening) was put up there in 1917.
Broun dubbed it “The Spring Offensive.”
He also declared that one of the actors had
given the worst performance he had ever
seen. The mummer sued for libel, but the
Court declared that the critic was free to
express his aesthetic opinion, however pain-
ful it might be to the performer, without
being called to account. When Broun came
to consider the same offender in another
play lie dismissed him with the line: “Mr.
Blank was not up to his standard.”
"L.H.P.” : Australia is getting used to see-
ing titled dames on the stage, but they were
rare in the old days. A gulf of 58 years
yawns between Lady Forbes-Robertson and
Lady Don, who drew all Sydney to the
Prince of Wales’s, where the Royal now
stands, in a varied season of musical drama
and burlesque. During six weeks the Don
dame appeared as Francis Osbaldistone
(“Rob Roy”), Henry Bertram (vjuy Man-
nering”), Don Caesar, Leicester ('ivenil-
worth”), Aladdin, Starlight Bess (“The
Flowers of the Forest”), Abdullah (“The
Forty Thieves”) and other roles. Her opening
part was Josephine in Buckstone’s “The
Child of the Regiment,” in which she sang
Donizetti’s music; and the same evening she
appeared as Orpheus in Byron’s burlesque,
“Orpheus and Eurydice.” Her local sup-
port included Emma and Frank Howson,
who afterwards went to England—in 1878
Emma was the original Josephine in “Pina-
fore.” This was Lady Don’s second season
in Sydney, her first having been with her
husband, Sir William Don, in April, 1861.
William died at Hobart in the meantime.
Returning to England the widow took the
Theatre Royal at Nottingham, and married
one Wilton.

“0.K.”: James M. Glover, a veteran per-
former at the game, writes of musical criti-
cism in the Stage (Lond.) :
We take musical criticism too seriously. Half
the public do not want it so; the other half do not
read it. When I made fun of Siegfried, with his
pantomime dragon “only fit for Christmas eonsump-'
tion for children,” I was laughed at. But here is
the eminent critic Mr. Ernest Newman following
in my footsteps. I have never written anything
so lively as this: “The death of Marie Lloyd has
put an end to what used to be one of the great
hopes of my life —to see her as Kundry, with George
Robey as Parsifal. The seduction scene would have
been something to remember in old age.”
So musical criticism in Britain is getting
a sense of humor. Also, it has a. growing
sense of profanity where old Wagner, tin-
mighty god of musical noise and mystical
nonsense, is concerned. Even in the earliest
and least “emancipated” of Wagner’s operas
there is an absurdity which music maniacs
have conspired to regard as sublimity. Wiy
not indulge in ridicule where it is due? Old
operas like “Rigoletto” and “Faust,” and later
operas like “Cavalleria,” to name only a few
dramatic romances, can be successful as
ordinary stage dramas. But “Parsifal,
played as spectacular drama, was a farce
posing as a pious exhortation. Isn’t it
time to stress the fact that Wagner’s operas
—especially the later ones —are in need ot
relentless editing and rational criticism?

“First Old Man”: Cyril Mackay held at
least one record. During his comparatively
short stay in Australia he appeared under
the banner of every known management.
Brought out from England by .J. C. William-
son, he was engaged afterwards by George
Marlow, Hugh D. Mclntosh (for sketches),
George Willoughby, William Anderson, the
Taits, Beaumont Smith (for pictures), and
lastly by Harrington Reynolds and De Tisne,
who run a stock company in Brisbane.
“Box-Officer”: The passing of Cyril
Mackay drew a sigh of regret from % at least
one Australian playwright. Cyril’s last
appearance in Adelaide was with the local
Repertorians in Alex. Melrose’s comedy, “The
Usual Three.” The play called for a juven-
ile lead, who was a fascinating, miscel-
laneous love-maker, with plenty of assurance
and contempt for consequences. Mackay
filled the part perfectly to the eye, ear and
intelligence. His very exuberance of manner,
to which “0.K.” refers (B. 3i)/7/’23), gave
A FANATIC.
AGENT: “I’m sending Miggs round to you
during the week; he’ll take as much
futurist stuff as you can give him.”
ARTIST: " That’s the trouble. He’s what
you might call an out-and-out. futurist
—even in the matter of payment.”
just the touch needed for the character and
the right stimulus to the amateur support.
The pity of it is that both play and per-
formance should have been lost on the desert
air of a one-night show in a minor theatre.
“Mid Channel”: In my opinion Cyril
Maekay was the best “juvenile” Australia
has had since Cecil Ward. I saw between
50 and 60 plays during a seven months’ stay
in America in 1918-19, but failed to find
Mackay’s equal in young-man parts. That
quick movement of his eyes (B. 19/7/’23)
was not an affectation; it was perfectly
natural, and at times most effective. Maekay
would have made an ideal Hugh Ardale in
“Mrs. Tanqueray”—a part which has never
been well done in Australia since the B. and
B. days.
“Tliersites”: Concerning Rignold’s knack
of using up old scenery, properties and
dresses, Rock Phillips, for years G.R.’s pro-
perty-master, used to tell how a pantomime,
“The House That Jack Built,” was put on
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, for a total cash
outlay in the departments mentioned of 30s.
And that was spent on tacks and glue. Rig-
nold’s old “Romeo and Juliet” dresses fur-
nished forth “Faust” very respectably, and
were worn in other productions. But some
managers go to the other extreme. Passing
through Bland; Holt’s store in Flinders-street,
Melbourne, I noticed a couple of London
omnibuses labelled as belonging to a certain
play. The storeman told me that, although
a similar ’bus was then; in use in the current
attraction, Bland had insisted on having a
new one made for the 'occasion, rather than
break into the complement of materiel re-
quired in any other play.
“Nella”: Instancing Nellie Stewart and
Mrs. Brough as clever actresses, “Pitt-
streeter” asks (B. 19/7/’23) whether “any-
thing cleverer has been seen on our stages
than Josie Melville’s performance of ‘Sally,’ ”
and whether Gladys Moncrieff’s work doesn't
compare with the best we have had —im-
ported or otherwise. This is unfair alike
to “Pitt-streeter’s” idols and his sense of pro-
portion. When Josie Melville has been
prima donna in 35 operas; principal boy or
girl in a score of pantos, from here to Drury-
lane; when she has sung Marguerite in
Gounod’s “Faust” for 28 consecutive per-
formances; when she has starred in comedy,
drama and tragedy, played lead in Shaks-
peare, captured audiences in England,
America and India, as well as Australasia,
and excelled in every branch of theatric art,
as Nellie Stewart has done, we may get
things in a truer perspective. Also, Gladys
Moncrieff must learn to dance, sing, act and,
above all, smile as captivatingly as Sweet
Nell before comparison—which is ever odious
—is possible. Mrs. Brough is a distinguished
actress —perhaps the ladies “Pitt-streeter”
cites may develop as she did. When she first
appeared here she was billed as an “opera
bouffe artist and charming vocalist” ; her sis-
ter, Emma Temple, was in those days “a
promising singer.”
“Mancam”; Alexander Mayne, dead in
Sydney at 80, was manager for Brough and
Boucicault for more thafi 20 valuable years.
Possessed of that elusive something we call
personality, besides being a polished elocu-
tionist, Mayne was a popular theatrical figure
in the ’eighties and thereabouts.
“Second Murderer”: Henry Russell, who
is assisting to collect the songsters for the
Melba Grand Opera outbreak, and is coming
here to boss the show, is a son of that Henry
Russell who wrote “Cheer, Boys, Cheer” and
“A Life on the Ocean Wave.” He used to
have a great reputation in London as a
teacher of singing, or, rather, as a coach.
“Sunny Jim”: My prize of a packet of
Capstans for the best gag about a celebrated
comedian now appearing in Melbourne must
go to the inventor of a story which turns
upon the hero handing several pounds of
plug tobacco to a menial and .asking if the
latter would cut it up. Expectant of a
reward, the underling- did the needful and
returned the shavings in a nice parcel. The
hero was visibly grateful. “Aye, thank
ve. thank ye,” he said. “An’, by-the-bye” (he
felt in his vest pocket and the servant
sprang forward for the anticipated half-
crown), “what hae ye done wi’ th’ tags?”
“Nero”: The Harry Cohen-Doris Duane
co., which has been doing the M.L. “smalls”
with “Scandal,” has formed a syndicate to
buy sweep tickets since its narrow escape
of ringing down the final curtain in the big
railway smash on July 5. It joined the ill-
fated train at Te Awamatu after the show,
but as most of the mummers had sleepers
the usual reserved theatrical carriage
(always placed next the engine) was dis-
pensed with. • In the two carriages next
the engine 17 people were killed.
“Ancient Prompter”: Unless the taste of
this nation has been, incurably perverted by
U.S.” “pitchers,” jazz-comedies and “crook”-
dramas, there ought to be a glad welcome
for Irene Vanbrugh and “Dot” Boucicault,
who open their Australian tour in Melbourne
on August 4. Irene is without doubt one
of the greatest artists that ever trod the
London boards, and Boucicault is the same
brilliant producer that we knew of old.
Their repertory will include a good deal of
Pinero, notably “His House in Order,” “The
Gay Lord Quex” and “The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray”; but there is to be anew
comedy, as yet un-named, by Somerset
Maugham.
“L.I-LP.”: The late Harry Lestou was an
excellent Shakspearean actor. I recollect
him appearing at Sydney Royal in 1882 as
Cloten in “Cymbeline,” Sir Andrew Ague-
cheek in “Twelfth Night,” and Lepidus in
“Antony and Cleopatra.” Joe Tolano is,
I think, the sole survivor of the Sydney
artists who supported American Louise
Pomeroy in these spectacular productions.
Leston was Flute in George Rignold’s revi-
val of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” at
Sydney Majesty’s in 1889-90. At the
old Gaiety in 1889 he made a hit as Dick
Swiveller in “The Old Curiosity Shop, ’
with Katie Putman in the dual role of Little
Nell and the Marchioness. When a young
man Leston frequently appeared at one in
the morning on the Sydney stage. That
was in the ’seventies, when the public liked
plenty for its money. In his time he played
everything, from the Bard to burlesque, and
he might have earned more than a local cele-
brity had he gone abroad in search of an
ampler field. But he had a horror of sea-
sickness, and let it master him.
“E.F.”: “Ned Kean of Old Drury,” men-
tioned (B. 12/7/’23) as a London failure,
is not the first attempt to present the dis-
solute Edmund as hero of a play. Dumas
pere wrote an extravagantly romantic drama
round the tradition of the English trage-
THE ETHICS OF MYTHOLOGY.
WAITER (to host): “Eh, boss —would it he wantin’ in tact if I was to offer the centaurs
straws with their soft drinks ?”
dian’s amours. Kean was represented as
trying his blandishments on a married lady
beloved of the Prince of Wales, who ban-
ished the actor to America for a year, to
punish his presumption. Kean went to
America, taking a certain Anna Danby with
him. As far back as 1868 the late Sarah
Bernhardt played Anna Danby, the heroine
of the French play, a reminder that Sarah
was playing leads 55 years ago.
“Orb” : Great singers like Melba can give
a dozen songs during an evening without
varying their garments, but the Saucy Sardine
Sisters of vaudeville must change their un-
dresses for every number. The serio-chronic
wouldn’t dream of cackling “Lend me a Cab-
fare, Ducky,” in the same glad rags that she
wore when caterwauling “Don’t Throw a
Lighted Lamp at Mother.” A clothes-line at
the back of the stage could be used much
more effectively to reveal the contents of the
glory-box. The artless actorine might then
chirrup of the lodger and the twins, and all
the rest of it, without fatiguing herself by
undergoing partial desquamation every min-
ute of her expensive time.
“Ex-Englishman”: That par. about "the
one scream” which made a London ingenue
a star (B. 12/7/’23) recalls a very moderate
stage version of “Jane Eyre,” put. on in
London about 25 years ago. The maniac wife
burst into the proceedings with a really
blood-curdling effort, “off,” which prompted
the Referee to remark that the play was
“saved by a scream.” And that recalls that
Lewis Cohen, nine times mayor of Adelaide,
and owner of an unusually penetrating voice,
once claimed that he had done a good bit of
amateur acting in his time. On which the
usual good-natured friend thoughtfully
observed : “You must have been awfully good
at ‘Shouts are heard, off,’ ”
“Sneezer”: Austin, the burly comedian of
the “Rockets”, revue at Melbourne Palace,
is a joyous joke, but some of: his wheezes are
old friends. One of them has passed into the
humorous currency of American burlesque
shows in a more pungent form. In the Ameri-
can version a Salv’afmy street rescue-meet-
ing is necessary as a background. A typical
Yankee burlesque tough, with huge feet and
a Gargantuan glass tiepin, wanders in half-
drunk and questions the Colonel of the squad.
On learning that the officer is “saving” girls,
the awful object blurts out: “Say, kid, save
me two blondes and a brunette for Saturday
night.”
“L.H.P.”: Although ‘ The Beggar’s
Opera,” produced at Covent Garden in Jan-
uary, 1726, was the progenitor of musical
farce and operatic drama, it did not find imi-
tators for generations. Then came Dibdin’s
“The Quaker,” “The Padlock” and “The
Waterman,” and Isaac Bickerstaff’s delicious
“Gove in a Village,” with its charming
comedy and delightful airs, and his “Lionel
and Clarissa,”- now quite forgotten. These,
with other pieces of the kind, “Rosina,” “No
Rong, No Supper,” “The Miller and His
Men,” etc., and music by fine old composers
were the popular entertainments in their day.
Now that the vein is being worked once more
it is a wonder that managers don’t follow
one another with revivals of Dibdin, Bishop
and Bickerstaff, as well as of Gay.
“Phil Cowan” : To write of Gus Elen as
an imitator of Albert Chevalier (“10-2-4,” B.
19/7/’2B) is to do the former an injustice.
Chevalier was the Sentimental Bloke of Cock-
aigne. Elen was in a different class—no
philosophic humorist, but something of a
cynic. Some of us, now, alas, in the sere
and yellow, still remember the concentrated
bitterness he threw into the “Dunno where
V are” of the modestly-enriched Jack Jones;
also his disgust at his pal’s wife when “un-
derneath her thumb went Jim.” The only
stroke of luck he allowed himself was when
his dustman found a hag of farthings, and
"'Now I’m goin’ ter be a regler toff, ridin
in a kerridge an’ a pair.” Like Chevalier,
Elen always kept his songs clean, at a time,
too, when a little suggestiveness was not only
tolerated but expected in a vaudeville turn.
“Norbell”: Concerning “Caesar's Ghost’s”
experiences with Charlie MacMahon (B.
5/7/’23). In the good old days I’ve been on
a tour for months and never got one full
week. And not with the Scalem Dramatic
Co. either. With Alfred Dumpier we
jumped, for example, from Warwick (Q.) ,H
Charters Towers, losing seven days en route,
and the old boy wouldn’t play on Saturdays
when bushwhacking, regarding Saturday as
a dud. It was the same with all of ’em.
Under the Firm’s management I’ve jumped
from Adelaide to Brisbane, losing four nights
in this feat, and having to pay for three
nights’ sleepers as well. Also, the salaries
were nothing like what they are now. Come
to think of it, George Musgrove was the
only manager who ever insulted me with full
salary, play, rest or travel, for every week
engaged. Peace be with him.
“Hamfat”: It is a mistake to employ an
“advance” who is too free with passes. Once
at Hawera (M.L.) our show struck a night
that was full of gale and dampness, so much
so that we didn’t expect any house at all. To
everybody’s amazement 53 persons turned up.
When the business-manager came round, our
Oscar Asche put it to him that it was no
use playing, and that the money had better
be handed back. “If that’s the case,” said
the manager morosely, “we’ll have to hand
back at least a fiver more’n we’ve taken.
Only six people have paid to go in, and we
don’t know 7 who they are.” So a show w r as
given to a “paper” house, and I trust the
six paying patrons enjoyed it. They were
heroes if they did.
“Geo Rich”: About the bleakest show-
township in the Commonwealth is JR
Barker (W.A.). Recently a visiting troupe
of eight played to an audience of ten two-
bbbbers; and the hall cost 30s. Before that
a singer of some distinction had a 30s. house.
She warbled one song and returned the
money. Further back a vaudeville co. had
,a. two-nights’ season, and dragged in a nyer
gross. The w'orst of it is that the dashed
place is so inconveniently situated. It is a
longish step to Albany, and the local ra«-
waymen get quite uncivil when actor-rs who
have jumped the Perth rattler are yankpa
from under a carriage-seat.
COMEDY AND TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"In Bochum (Germany) a shopkeeper, who during
a theatre performance where trench soldiers were
present shouted, ‘Look to your honor and remember
Sehlageter,’ was sentenced to a year’s imprisonment
and fined a million marks,” — Cable.
“Two well-known clowns in the Russian State
circus at Moscow have been executed for ridiculing
Soviet leaders.”— Another.
“When I played Hamlet,” Howler said,
And eyed his whisky with a sigh,
“Quite frequently I’d bow my head
When patrons suddenly let fly
Assorted compliments at me,
Denoting hate—-or sympathy.
“The groundlings I could not repress;
A rank egg seemed a witticism ;
A ripe tomato would express
Their highest form of criticism ;
The galled jade sometimes had to wince
When I essayed the gloomy Prince.
“The ribald ruffians, void of taste,
Made merry with my suits of woe;
With noisome garbage they would paste
My sable tights and paletot;
Vile omelettes on me they’d rain—
-1 was a melancholy Dane.
“But other countries, other ways:
The actor gets his chance in Bochum ;
If any critic there inveighs
They set the knave to picking oakum;
He’s mulct in marks, there on the Rhine —
I trust the actor gets the fine.”
Here I proposed another spot,
And said, “But what of Moscow, then?
There two poor clowns have just been shot
For ridiculing public men.”
“Gadzooks!” said Howler. “Serves ’em right!
Comedians should be shot on sight.”

Tbe New Superior
CHEVROLET
THE term “economical transportation” becomes
more than a mere phrase when expressed in
connection with the New Superior Chevrolet.
Low fuel consumption is ensured by its wonderful
valve-in-head engine—low, even in comparison with
other four-cylinder cars of similar construction.
Wear on tyres is reduced to the minimum by the
careful balance of the New Superior chassis and the
low percentage of unsprung weight.
The simplicity of the mechanism makes for oil
economy.
With low first cost and low upkeep cost the New
Superior Chevrolet gives uniformly economical
transportation.
A Few Special Features of
the New Superior Chevrolet.
Streamline body design, with high radia-
tor; vacuum feed and rear petrol tank on
all models; drum-type head lamps with
non-glare lenses; full-crowned and
panelled mudguards; high-tension mag-
neto, etc.

An Air of Distinction.
(BY PHLOX.)
“\7" E B°<ls, she’s handsome f What a
stunner!”
These were among tiie explana-
tions uttered by the staff of Goodby and
bons w hen Mabel Mackay, the new clerk,
made her first appearance in the office. At!
eyes were riveted on her. And when Miss
Mackay took her seat at the desk lately
vacated by Miss Johnson, who had left to
get married, more than one of the staff specu-
lated as to how long it would be before Miss
Mackay vacated it for the altar.
As is usual in firms where there is a large
staff of women, some of the girls generously
admired Miss Mackay; others envied her.
But there were others who could not quite
make up their minds about her. She cer-
tainly \\ as attractive, they argued, and on
the whole distinctive-looking. But, as
Myia Black remarked, she hadn’t a feature
to her face. Her complexion was good, and
her hair always well groomed; otherwise
she had no beauty to boast about. Before
long, however, even the girls who criticised
her began to admire and to like her. There
was something irresistible about her. Mr.
Clarence Goodby, a son of the firm, evidently
thought so. From the first he was attracted
by her, but whether he liked her as a friend
or something mor e the staff was unable to
say.
Mr. Clarence, as he was known to them,
was one of those gentle, kindly young men
whose sole wish seemed to be to give plea-
sure to others. Mabel was, of course, flat-
tered by and enjoyed bis attentions. She
was not a girl who made many friends, and
in her lonely bed-sittingroom at the b’oard-
mg-house she loved to dwell on what the
good-looking son of the firm had said to her
at the firm s concert the other evening, or
at the dance the girls had organised for the
Girls Realm Guild Fund. She knew that he
admiied liei, but no word of love had been
spoken between them. She must look her
best at tiie firm s annual dance, now only
three weeks off.
* * * *
Goodby and Sons’ dance was always one
of the smartest of the season. Not only tin
employees but the principals and their wives
and friends attended. Among others Mabel
was introduced to a Miss Jackson, the
daughter of a university professor, and was
chatting with her when Mr. Clarence Good-
by came to claim her for a dance. Mabel
hadn’t a partner for that dance, and as her
eyes followed the pair she thought how well
they looked together. What beautiful fea-
tures and pretty eyes Miss Jackson had. A
tinge of jealousy crossed her mind, but she
quickly checked it. Mabel had the next
dance with Mr. Clarence, and thoroughly
enjoyed it.
Later in the evening Mabel found herself
again beside Miss Jackson. “Don’t yon
think Mr. Clarence Goodby is handsome?”
she asked Mabel.
"Yes, and good, too,” replied Mabel.
“We're engaged, you know.”
"I hadn’t known ; but I must congratulate
you.”
“Oh, we’re not formally engaged, though
he really proposed to me when I was 15
and he 18. But there’s nothing of the lover
about him, and he’s dreadfully shy. Mother
always says that when he does marry lie
will do the deed suddenly and quietly.”
"May I take you in to supper, Miss
Mackay ?” asked Mr. Clarence, bowing low.
Mabel took the proffered arm. Mary
Jackson looked astonished, and watched the
pair out of sight, when she was claimed
Professor Doyle’s son.
After supper Clarence asked Mabel to
walk with him in the palm court, and later
when they rejoined the others. Mabel’s face
was rosy red. At the conclusion of the ball
Mr. John Goodby, the head of the firm an-
nounced his son's engagement to Miss Mac-
kay, and also intimated that tlw marriage
would take place shortly.
* * » #
To the first “at home” that Mabel gave
as wife of Clarence Goodby, she invited all
the girls of the firm, who heartily congratu-
lated her on her good fortune in having such
a beautiful home. They wandered about
admiring this and that. And, of course, they
wanted to see all her pretty frocks.
“What a sweet dressing-table set!” re-
marked Molly Wardlaw.
“I designed and made it myself,” said
Mabel.
"llow nice this cream smells. What is it?”
“Oh, that’s ruercolized wax—a really
lovely face-cream.”
"Ah-ha, is that what makes your com-
plexion so good?”
It must be. because I’ve never used any
other cream. I would advise you to use it,
too.”
I will, and I, and I,” echoed the others.
"What’s your powder?”
Barri-agar— just as good as the cream.”
And what’s in this tin so cunningly en-
closed in a pretty little receptacle?”
That’s stallax —an excellent shampoo for
the hair. I never use anything else. And
if you 11 take a married woman’s advice,
girls, you’ll use these preparations, too. for
<i good complexion and good hair gives one
an air of distinction.”—Advt. 13

Darius D.: To do him justice, Mr. Clowes
wrote in haste (though not in time) to correct
that slip.. . . W.McV.: But under the Act of 1918
a previously unconvicted woman charged with a minor
offence is tried in private, unless she asks that the
hearing be in public, and no press report of the
trial in camera may be published... .E.R.D.: No
space to establish the unassailable proposition that
“we all view the rain through glasses colored by
personal interests and requirements”.... To Po:
Material for a two-inch par at most. .. .W.L.: If
the discoverer of the predatory' crow trying to hatch
out 15 golf balls hadn’t been a clerk of courts we
wouldn’t have believed the yarn.... Mashie: There js
something the matter with your aar....E1.D.: Sure
you got that man’s name right V.... Parkin: Scarcely
a. movement in it —a worm is a hurricane by
comparison.... Marjorie: Your shadows don’t do any-
thing worth writing about... .L.S. (Narromine) : The
verse is all skin and bone.... A.J.H.: No value....
L. 8., jun.: The beer yarn only made us sad. ...G.P.M.
Pure melodrama. .. .H.N.T. : They all want feeding-
up.... Elizabeth P.: Your sorrowful story doesn’t
move u 5.... John M.: Wild tale drearily t01d....
H.0.D.: You have the Hour, but you don’t make the
bread... .W.J.W.: An ancient idea that failed to stir
any emotions... .Cou-ee: Not brightly enough done.
....W.C.C.: Well intentioned, but you must write
it better than that.... Mary It.: The same old ship
that has sailed through so many albums... .W.S.E.:
We note that you saw the moon rise and the dawn
arrive; but we couldn’t recommend that a medal
be struck to celebrate the events... .Stanley C.: Your
rain bumps like a superannuated wheelbarrow....
Bobert E.: Badly written commonplace. .. .Bellerive:
We like the vivid battle piece best: —
Two ruffians of an alley
Named McCarty and O’Shay
Boldly stripped for combat
In a pugilistic way.
O’Shay, a battered mortal,
Of rough-and-tumble sprees.
A target to McCarty
Was pumbled to he’s knees
When wildly to he’s rescue
A woman named big Sally,
Gamely with a poker charged
The terror of the alley.
“No policeman’s baton ever played
Such havoc with he’s head
As the lumps that she inflicted,”
Said McCarty up in bed.
....Alberta: We lost the story in the tangle of
words.... F.F.M.: Sorrowful attempt to make mirth
by playing with dirt E.M.E.: The “Afternoons”
don’t strike us hard enough. .. .Mackel: Not worth
saying, and weakly said.... Auticus: It goes rather
heavily.... Dunbar (or some other disguised signa-
ture): Very crude... .William C.: You contrive to
make it rather tedious... .Ecce: The sonnet is thin
and'covers old ground.... Simla: You must get more
into it. ..-Splinter: You have mislaid the humor.
D.S. (Hobart): Very poor Shell: It goes out,
but not with violence. .. . 11.A.J.: A little too clumsy
for the slight thing it is. You might be able to
give it more finish. .. .Henry T. : It hasn’t the
strength to climb in.... Scrubber: The old thing
done a little worse Samuel M.: Very wooden
F.E.T.: Don’t like it J.M.M.: Uninteresting
Augustus W.: Let the “War God” clang- his battle
tea-tray
I, the War God, existed before the world begun.
I w'as in Heaven as the first war was run.
Some angels fought for the throne of God.
They wanted be all alike, for God was no good.
The revolting Angels were all sent to Hell.
Since that day, Satan the Divel has done very well.
He went first in the Garden of Eden to see
What like Adam and Eve would be.
The Divel was near, the War was at hand ;
They trampled God’s notice down in the sand.
Then I again was with Cain, Murderer the first.
Who slew Abel, just simply for blood thirst.
Since that day, I the War, they call me the brave;
They made me their god till to their grave
Humans worship me, I their treasure gift.
Satan, the War, is god ; the times fly switt.
H.J.G.: Wanted a much finer touch to make
that scene live R.D.C.: You don’t get the breath
of life into the yarn. .. . W.E.8.: “Mr. liobben
moves as though he had his State's debt on his
back. .. . A.E.C.: The talking horses are not well
enough presented. .. .L.H.P.: “Jim” fails in interest.
T.H.C.: -No point in the story Charles M.:
One might do; the others are too slight, though
nicely done... .Kappa: Misses P.O’R.: Not much
hope while your ear will allow you to rhyme “door’
with “saw” Jean A.: Not quite Curlew: More
like a crow Picko: Far too rugged Dan O’F.:
Not enough in it The Ov'erlander: Horrible.
C.W.P.: The pig-killing sketch is brutal without
being amusing... .J.H.D.: A dreary waste of
words. .. .Mary N.: Just hammers out the old
commonplaces... .The Shark: The man who just
throws things off” invites this paper to just throw-
tilings out T.F.G.: The salary of the Chief
Justice Of the U.S.A. is 15,000 dollars ( £3126) :
of his associates, 14,500 dollars ( £3020)... .Hop
Wah: You’ve tangled your argument and dulled
vour points. .. .L.H.P.: Thanks, but you don t
plough a new furrow' in a well-cultivated paddock.
....Stirling S.: Off our beat; and very elementary,
anyhow.... Q.P.: The Moore note is too superficial
E.J.H.: Glad to hear from you again; but that
proposition has already had its answer.... Cam:
If your story was a cow it would be put in the
pound for wandering... .Mary V.: That imitation
which is the sincerest flattery drives us to this: —
Mary wrote a little pome
About an old blind crow ;
It was so bad, into the W.
P.B. it had to gow.
....Charles M.: “Boy AValking” has merit; but a
few clumsy lines block it C.K.T.: Long space,
short interest P.St.A.S.: If you don’t want sub-
editorial curses to blight your young life, leave some
space between your lines of typewriting P.C.F.:
That pen-name has already been selected.. . .W. 8.5.:
Get in.touch with some reputable patent agent. They
advertise on the Cat page Long’un: Will have to
take its chance.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.S.: Gone to the place appointed for such vic-
tims. .. .R.F.R.: Not within coo-ee.. • .Hainan: You’ll
have to make a lot more tries yet H.J.8.: Both
gags and drawing weak... .E.K.: No humor in a
man making a butcher’s, shop of himself L.L.S.:
A bad miss A.E.C.: The most tragic effort to
date B.B.: A passable dog; but the trouble is you
call it a sheep. .. .K.P.M.: Yes, Art is long ; we think
it would pay you to cut yours off short J.L.L.: A
lady balanced like that belongs to a circus, not
a drawing-room.

HIS is the problem, in the habit-forming years, to awaken interest , whether in music or the other
desirable graces that make for well-bred manhood and charming femininity. In interest lies apprecia-
tion. In appreciation reside the germs of ripening acquaintance. From continual contact comes the
familiarity which enables man or woman to wear such graces as an accustomed garment.
And above all other things, must music be a close companion. Its pleasures and comforts, its powers
to sooth hurts of soul and mind ; its cheerfulness and uplift are more readily understood and used,
as knowledge of it expands in scope and increases in character.
The New Beale Player-Piano provides this opportunity
for expansion. It is a complete, interpretative instru-
ment that will enable you to guide, with positive
surety, the faltering steps of your children’s early
musical adventurings.
With it you will journey forth with them into a won-
derful land of romance. With them you will sweep
the skies in Wagner’s "Ride of the Valkyries With
them you will buffet the wind and rain and sleet in
Weber’s "Storm.” You will guide them in the wisdom
of your own knowledge of what is best; you will play
with an artistry that will teach respect for the posses-
sion of adequate technique. Later, actual use of the
player, by themselves, may be encouraged as a spur
to analyse rhythm and phrasing, long before their
manual dexterity is sufficiently developed.
This is the way in which the New Beale Player is being
used by many other parents who value music as a
distinctly home influence. It is the one instrument
which provides a perfect piano for manual use, with
controls that make artistic interpretation, not merely
possible, but almost instinctive. It is the New Beale of
vyhich Mr. Oscar Asche wrote, saying; "It is impossible
to express in mere words my appreciation of your instru-
ment. ” Its endorsement is unanimous amongst many
eminent musicians, both as an instrument with high
interpretative ability and concert qualities.
The encasements of the New Beale are genuine cabi-
net woods, double hand-selected. Rich Italian wal-
nut, low-toned mahogany of correct hue, rosewood of
historic fame, make it a piano to kindle pride of
ownership.
It is easily purchased, being within the reach of even modest incomes. Silent pianos accepted
in partial exchange and liberal terms extended 'where desired. ‘■Printed matter posted free.

“Jumbo”: Bananaland still justifies its
title. A bunch of bananas with 128 indi-
vidual fruit, 28 being on the upper hand,
and all averaging lOin. in length and 6in. in
circumference, was recently received by the
Director of Fruit Culture from Hansen’s
farm at Dagun, on the Mary Valley line.
“Adelaide”: S.A. Government has decided
to take the advice of its American Chief
Commissioner of Railways. Webb has con-
demned practically the whole of the work-
shops at Islington. There is plenty of land,
and the out-of-date equipment is to be made
modern. “There will be nothing better any-
where,” says Webb. “It will fill all require-
ments for a century to come. Cost? About
£200,000.”
* * * *
“Long Shore” : German cargo-steamers are
familiar once more in Australian ports, but
the Freiberg is the first boat to resume pas-
senger carrying. There are likely to be
many more within the next few months.
Whether the prejudice against travelling
under- the German fiag will be proof against
the reduced fares, which, it is understood,
will be £3O less in both classes than those
charged by other lines, remains to be seen.
“Adamascus”: The Bananaland Govern-
ment has found a contractor in its own
State for the superstructure of the Burnett
railway bridge. Walkers, of Maryborough,
have the contract, and their boilermakers
will do most of the work. The bridge will
consist of nine large lattice spans and six
plate web spans, representing over 700 tons
of steel work—quite a respectable bit of
blacksmithing.
* * * *
Uramao”: Recent tests of M.L. timbers
for pulp are encouraging. Experiments made
in London showed that the fibre of beeches,
birches and certain other M.L. woods were
not even enough to be used alone; but sub-
sequent tests, made by a representative of
the State I orest Service in co-operation with
a London firm, demonstrated that kahikatea
and rimu, of which large quantities are re-
garded as waste in Westland, can produce
the finest writing-papers.
* * * *
“Sturt”: The Holden Motor-body Co., of
Adelaide, has added to its big barracks in
King William-street South 22 acres at sub-
urban YY oodville. It has branches in Mel-
bourne and Sydney, is about to open another
in Brisbane, and claims to be the biggest
thing of its kind in the British Empire out-
oi^JwY ana^a ' le out Put is expected to be
20,000 cars a year when the Woodville works
are up. Building coaches for S.A. and other
railways is also part of the programme, but
under-carriages are not in it.
* * * *
44 “Sucre”: “H. Ilardupp” (B. 12/7/’23)
tak’s the low way”; I’ll “tak the high-
way, and be robbed just as badly. I never
stirred out of Pitt-street, and this is how
I fared. I bought a dozen “new-laid subur-
ban eggs” at 3s. 6d. Three were dodoes.
A pound of ham—the scales at home made
a liar of the retailer’s by 4oz. Two pounds
of fruit cake (“it’s just over the 21b,” that
liar said) weighed 11b. 120 z.; and 21b. of
tomatoes were soz. short. The Surry Hills
garrotters strike me as honest robbers in
comparison.
* * ♦
Stellsby”: Tom Walsh’s lads view with
pronounced disfavor the proposed introduc-
tion of the book discharge in lieu of the
single sheet. The reasons are obvious
enough; for the British “Continuous Certi-
ficate of Discharge” book makes it necessary
for the seamen to watch his p’s and q’s,
whereas the single-sheet system, as practised
in Australia, imposes no such obligation.
A decline t:o report” discharge for character
or ability in a “book” effectively penalises
the seaman: the same discharge on “paper”
is innocuous, and may be torn up under
the shipping-master’s nose. The British
Board of Trade sensibly introduced the
“book” in 1901.
* * « «
“Saxby”: The rumor (B. 28/6/’23) that
an American co. is prepared to build a rail-
way to Port Stephens and develop that dis-
trict was energetically exploited bv a land
salesman who toured the Backblocks recentlv
selling- land at the port. He clinched sales
by saying: “I absolutely guarantee that a
railway will be built there, and that an
American co. will spend £3,000,000 in the
district within three years.” He flourished
a very pretty lithograph, showing sites for
theatres, public departments and such-like.
Mot so much in evidence was a long, obscure,
pi inted contract which the purchaser seldom
read, and could not understand if he did.
Later on he found that the contract con-
tained a clause stating that the vendor was
not responsible for any representations not
written in the contract.
SHIPS ANCIENT AND MODEKN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We've served afloat on a lime-juice boat
For ease and a coolie’s pay,
Where we cleaned the glass and polished the brass
For the half of a dollar a day.
We've gained some scars ’neath the stars and bars
On a Yankee hell afloat,
Where a Bucko mate sang his hymn of hate
With a gun hidden under his coat.
We’ve done a trip on a German ship—
Shanghied by a Gravesend tout—
And we worked like hell on junk and the smell
Of a tank full of sauer-kraut.
W e’ve toed the mark on a burgoo barque,
And we scraped her beef-kids clean,
For no gulls trail after ships that hail
From the port of Aberdeen.
We’ve signed for a.trip on a Blue Nose ship,
And her pumps were foul and worn,
As we stood to our knees in the clear green seas
When we drove her around Cape Horn.
On barque and brig, all nations and rig-,
We have sailed o’er the seven seas ;
Now it’s oh for a trip on a Commonwealth ship
Where you work when you damn well please!
Chorus:
W here you work when you damn well please, my lads,
And say what you damn well please;
lor we've all got a vote on a Gov’ment boat,
So we work when we damn well please.

“Wh eels within Wheels”
There can hardly be found a more apt application of this
old saying than when applied to
BALL-BEARING AXLES
iS
4/23
The old-time hub is really more of a fitting to hold
the axle rod as the centre of the circular wheel; but
the races of the SKF Ball-Bearing Axle can actually
be termed wheels in themselves—the core which
carries the outer framework.
Thus the ball-bearings eliminate friction and drag,
and allow the heaviest load to be moved with mini-
mum effort.
It’s worth your while to inquire.

Five months short of a century was the
recorded age of Mrs. Mary Mew, who died
at Taree, on the N.S.W. North Coast, the
other day. She was conveyed to hospital by
her son, who had reached his 70th year.
Until a few weeks ago the lady, who had
been twice married, used to go a-visiting
regularly.
“Jumbo”: Ferricks, who represents the
working-men of South Brisbane in the Banana-
land Parliament, was in the running for
the job of Assistant-Minister in Theodore’s
Cabinet, but his frankness at the Emu Park
Labor Convention lost him the votes of the
aristocracy of the Caucus. Ferricks has
plenty of ability, but not in the way of log-
rolling. He sat in the Federal Senate for
a number of years, and has tried journalism,
farming and school-teaching.
“8.E.”: There dropped in at Inglewood
(Vic.) the other day an old man on his last
lap. Calling on one of the oldest store-
keepers he said he owed £l5 10s., and
wanted to square everything up before he
passed out. “Oh, that’s written off as a bad
debt if it was contracted in 1870,” said the
storekeeper. But the old man insisted that
the ledger, be looked up. It was found, and
the upshot was the squaring of the bill with
a tenner. I wonder how many men could
find a ledger back that far —and there are
other things to wonder at in the incident.
A link with the days of the Imperial
regime in N. S. Wales and Norfolk Island
snapped recently at the death of Fleurette,
widow of Carl F. Riemenschneider, who
lived in a fine house on the corner of Burton
and Brougham streets, Darlinghurst. She
was a daughter of that Morrissett who was
major of the 48th Regiment when the corps
arrived in Sydney, was commandant at Nor
folk Island in 1529-33, and was not over-
loved by the exiles. Mrs. Riemenschneider
was born on the island, and as an infant
in arms was brought to Sydney when Col.
Anderson succeeded to the command. She
was twice married, and left three sons and
a daughter. Incidentally, her father was
P.M. at Bathurst after his return from
Norfolk Island.
“Sturt”: The motor-trade in Adelaide
claims to have discovered that South Aus.
spends far more money on cars, per head
of population, than any other State. Accord-
ing to its figures, the expenditure is a
shade over £1 a head for the half-million in-
habitants; Vic. and N.S.W. dead-heat for
a bad second at under 15s. 6d.; Westralia
comes next with 13s. Id.; Q. and Tas. are
mere also-rans with 9s. 9d. and 9s. 4d. It
seems quite possible. There are no offen-
sively rich people in S.A., but the general
standard is high. And the money which
might induce a plutocrat to buy three or
four cars may well be spent on a score if it
is distributed among as many homes.
“8.U.P.”: Every year, in a single ship-
ment, Busrah, in the Persian Gulf, sends us
2000 tons of dates for Australian consump-
tion ; and there are consignments from else-
where. < Yet experts tell us that the Austra-
lian climate and soil in certain parts are
admirably adapted for the cultivation of
this food. Thirty years ago an effort was
made to introduce date-growing into Aus-
tralia, but the seeds must have been faulty,
and only a small proportion grew to trees
which produced dates. For all that, dates
can and should be growm here ; near Bourke,
on the Upper Darling, are some splendid
palms whch produce fruit equal to any-
thing imported.
Instances of the idiosyncrasies of the
Repat. Department continue to edify the
Reps. The other night Man* cited the case
of a Digger who wanted to acquire a motor-
truck for £2OO, and having saved up £6O
asked the Department for the loan of the
balance on the usual terms. Inspection
showed that the truck was a good invest-
ment, and the sale was approved; but to the
warrior’s astonishment he was dunned for
the £2OO because some donkey in the office
had sent the vendor a cheque for that amount
instead of the £l4O stipulated. Foster, the
now almost-silent member for Wakefield
(S.A.), suggested that the person responsible
ought to return the £6O to the Treasury out
of his own pocket. But failing an endeavor
to collect the overpayment from the seller,
the Department will probably write off the
loss, as it is alleged to have done in numer-
ous other cases.
“Sol. Malaprop”: Looking at the map of
the Warragamba catchment area, which is
to supply Sydney with so much water that
a famine will be unknown, it seems to
me that the new supply will include
samples of the germs and garbage of Litli-
gow, Katoomba, Mittagong, Moss Vale,
Goulburn and all the towns, townlets, ham-
lets and farms in between, these places being
all on the area. I don’t suppose there is
any remedy. When people have an ambition
to own the bigaest city south of the line
(Sydney is third biggest now, but hopes are
bright if the loans hold out), and that city
is located in a dry country, and is built on
absorbent sandstone to boot, it must take
water as it comes. And it must not be too
particular if there are a few gnats and an
occasional camel in it —floating upside-down,
as all dead camels do.
“F.L.E.”: It’s a question whether the
150 ft. building-limit upon Sydqey skyscrapers
is enough. The Hotel Australia (Rowe-
street end), Commonwealth Bank, Daily
Telegraph, Culwulla Chambers and Union
House are the only five to rear their heads
so high thus far. But future possibilities are
startling. Nine others now going up are the
Astor, in Macquarie-street: the Manchester
Unity building, opposite Hyde Park ; the Aus-
tralian Metropolitan Life and the S. M.
Herald Offices, in Hunter-street; the Com-
mercial Bank, in Barrack-street; the new
State Savings Bank, that threatened to block
the extension of Martin-place; the Bank of
N. S. Wales, in Macquarie-place; the Scot-
tish Australian Investment Co.’s offices, in
I’itt-street (where was once Inglis’s horse
bazaar) ; and Hoskins’s Buildings, in Mar-
garet-street. Plans for another mooted half-
dozen on the architects’ tables include a hotel
where Burdekin House now stands in Mac-
quarie-street, and a wholesale drug store in
Carrington-street. Frankly such accelera-
tion of building pace is disquieting, for, even
though our limit is only half the height of
the Singer and the Flat Iron Buildings of
New York, the possibilities of infinite repeti-
tion of these 14-storey blocks round Sydney
threaten more street-congestion problems
than ever.

LITTLE sea, little sea,
Bring your waves and your
streams
Bring your tides to my knee
And your richest moon-dreams;
Bring the ships that you toss,
To their ruin and loss,
And your cyclone that screams
Over island and reef;
Bring your sparkle and play
On the sand of the bay,
. And your uttermost grief
Of the shoal and the bell.
Little sea, little sea,
Bring your salt ear to me ;
I have great things to tell.
Little stars of the night,
Little suns on their course,
Bring your movement and light
And your moth’s wing of force
That flutters and flies
Down a thought-breadth of skies.
With glitter and glow,
Come near, little eyes;
I have something to show.
Little time, little time,
Making small moments rhyme
Through the shine and the show-ers,
Into stanzas of hours
And cantos of days
And epics of ages,
While your heavy clock plays
Hide-and-seek with the sages.
Let your chimes ring thirteen
At the end of the night;
Then turn six new pages
And sit down and w-rite
All your ticking can mean.
Little life, little death,
Hold your doom, hold your breath !
Little darkness and light,
Little depth, little height,
Little hope, little fear,
All give me your ear
Till my heart tells you this:
I have tasted one kiss
That has made me so tall
I walk over you all!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MOTHER MARGERY stood still for
a moment on the sidewalk. When
she stood still like that with her
scarecrow tatters flapping about her, you
expected her to rattle like castanets. You
expected somehow- to hear the rattle of dry
bones.
Mother Margery walked on aimlessly.
She did not feel quite as much at home in
this busy little lane at the back of the ware-
houses as in the dingy alleys higher up.
There were more people here, and the side-
walk was narrow. Sometimes she was forced
into the roadway, where the chaff and straw
and tattered pieces of sodden paper lay—-
where it was wet, and the brownish moisture
that oozed between the stones soaked up
through her thin soles. Sometimes the
steaming breath of lorry-horses seemed to
brush her, and the hoarse shouts of the
drivers penetrated slowly through to her con-
sciousness.
Mother Margery was a shapeless bundle
of rags. From one end protruded her
broad, sprawling shoe; from the other
wagged her head, as though it’ were set on
fine, invisible wires. A dull, vague face this,
framed in its wisps of coarse grey hair,
heavy wdth a lassitude that let the slant, in-
turned mouth hang down at the corners, with
eyes that looked as if they had been stitched
in with pink silk. Not old, perhaps —for
Mother Margery had only reached the middle
years—but old with all the sin it had seen,
the agonies endured ; for all the want and
suffering that lay in sight for a scavenger of
the narrow streets, a ghoulish prowler of
the gutters.
The woman kept her head turned aside as
she ambled along the pavement, not because
she was ashamed, but because she wanted
passionately to avoid what she saw in all
that looked at her. She saw pity in
every eye. It looked straightly out of the
eyes of the old, furtively out of the faces
of the young. It was unnerving, terrifying
and strangely softening.
“Bah!” muttered Mother Margery venom-
ously as she shuffled along. “Let ’em keep
their pity ! Let the s keep it!”
She hastened on in an effort to get to her
own familiar network of alleyways, where
the dust-tins and gutters offered fair prizes
for the picking over. Her mouth moved as
she walked. Let her get away from all
these hateful eyes with their pity! A shadow
flitting vaguely among the other shadows in
the alley, she would not be singled out for
any special notice there as she was here.
She passed a constable on the first corner.
A spasm of hatred seemed to tear her in
two. She remembered that old trouble with
the sly-grog selling-—remembered his voice
as h e „said jocularly: “We’ll get you yet, old
lady!” But now even in the policeman’s
hard eyes she seemed to read an uncomfort-
able pity. She cringed past with a wheed-
ling smile.
Looking back she could see a slab of crim-
son, smouldering sky caught in between the
tall buildings. It seemed that the warm
red was floating out straight to her. It was
like the ruby that burned in the little lamp
above the altar in St. Mary’s, where the
priest droned through his prayers like a snor-
ing old dog. She pattered along her familiar
beat. Yen Wick, who sold blue jars and
ginger in his little shop, shuffled by over the
cup-hollowed steps. He looked at the
woman. She sensed the pity in his marble-
black eyes. before she actually saw it.
. Pity! Pity! Her ragged arms sawed the
air • Couldn t she get away from it, any-
where? It had never troubled her before.
1 erhaps she had never noticed it until to-
day. And now it was driving her somewhere,
she knew not where—driving her like the
stinging wind that seemed to be biting into
her very bones. It was making her eyes
prick—-unloosening something that had never
been unloosened for years. Great God! It
would end by making her cry! And tears
would be terrible. They would, as it were
wash away the grimy film from her blurred
glass of vision. She would see her terrible
little world as it was, sharp and clear
would see herkelf moving through it, hope-
less and-' awful, with nothing in front but
death. -Whereas, up till now, she had never
looked.clearly, never thought, or allowed her-
self to wonder about things—-an unreal thing
in an unreal world.
God! She beat her breasts with her
skinny-hand. Something drastic was hap-
pening within her. Something was break-
ing inside. She could not help herself. This
all-evident pity had wakened in her the need
for tears, for confessions and pardons, the
hunger for regeneration. She knew that she
would find herself in a moment waddling
back to the “cop,” confessing between maud-
lin sobs her share in the sly-grog traffic along
the Alley, confessing to other misdeeds,
pleading.... She had had the same acute de-
sires once when drunk. They had passed.
Ob, for the glance of one eye that had no
pity, to bring her back, to let her remember
that she was a contented old rag-and-bone
picker—nothing more, nothing less ! Disgust,
scorn, anger, derision —anything but pity!
She crossed the street hurriedly. A
shadow was detaching itself from a shadow
in the doorway. Over the doorway the plas-
ter was cracked and broken. The window-
bars had dusty festoons of cobwebs. The
shadow merged into the figure of a girl,
pathetically slight, forlornly young, with
drooping shoulders and twisted scarlet lips.
It was a. face of great beauty. The beauty
of a w r hite lily bent and broken in the winds,
bruised and soiled in the mud.
Mother Margery stood still. The girl
Vi’let! Everyone knew Yi’let down in the
Alley.
The girl looked at her acutely, her chin
lifting. In her young eyes the older woman
read something. Neither disgust, loathing
—nor pity ! None of these—envy !
Envy !
Yi’let was envying Mother Margery her
age, the repulsive plainness of face that left
her apart in safety. Her ugliness that let her
know peace.
Envy!
Once more Mother Margery was the filthy
scavenger of the tins and gutters—unfeeling
and uncaring, with no thought of the morrow
or what fresh miseries it might bring. There
was one who had looked upon her with an
eye of envy !
As the shadows swallowed her up, the
darkening street grew empty.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Intrusion of Mr. Quinch.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MAT CONYERS was making home
with ■ the surveyor’s plant, and
thinking of the one-and-only, after
impatient weeks of dragging the link-chain
about the bush, when he was joined by
Murty Brown, who was also driving towards
Sleepy Hollow, with a load of wood for him-
self on a borrowed cart of the scrap-heap
type.
“Your uncle w,'as in. town yesterday,”
cried Murty from the top of his load, “an’
he’s got a lamentation that I think he must
be settin’ to music—‘They’re all gettin mar-
ried but Mat.’ Our friend Jim Webb, you
know, has struck a match with that old
flame of yours. Can’t drag him out of the
municipality nowadays.”
“Miss Martell?” queried Conyers.
“That’s the peach. She was talkin’ about
you the other day. Reckons you haven’t a
hope with Selina. Only wastin’ your time.”
“Pity she couldn’t mind her own business,”
Conyers snarled. ,
“Seen anything of her lately?”
Conyers turned on him impatiently. “How
could I see her when I’ve been away sur-
veyin’ for the last two months?”
“Didn’t you see her before you went out?”
asked Murty imperturbably.
“No; an’ I’ve got no chance of seein’ her
now unless we meet by accident.”
“I can lay you on,” Murty informed him.
“She rides to Deep Creek every Saturday for
the mail. Know Malcolm Quincli, of Pint-
pot ?”
“Know him well. Broke in some horses
for him once. Jolly decent old chap.”
“Well, he meets Selina at the post office
when lie’s down this way, which is pretty
often, an’ rides home with her.”
“Friend of the family?”-—intensely eyeing
his happy informant.
“Expects to be more than a friend soon.
He’s stickin’ up to Selina —an’ it’s common
talk that her father’s helpin’ him.”
Conyers’s demeanor in respect to Mr.
Quincli changed abruptly. He swung round
with a quick flash of annoyance and alarm.
“Why, blind his eyes, he’s older than her
father, an’ bloomin’ near as white as a
flourbag!”
“That’s so,” Murty assented pleasantly.
“But he’s got young notions.”
“The maudlin old blighter ought to be
lynched!” Conyers snapped, jerking the reins
and dropping the whip heavily on the horse.-
“If I were you. Mat, I’d sit back an’ wait.
Before you’re middle-aged you’d come in for
the widow, an’ the squattage, an’ a big bank
account. What better investment could you
have than that?”
Conyers lit a cigarette, whacked the horse
again on general principles, and smoked sulk-
ily for half-a-mile. Then he made some trite
observations about the weather, and inquired
in a disinterested way how his venerable
uncle was getting on. He was not a man
who was easily thwarted ; he had effrontery
enough for two; but he was up against a
problem just now that required a lot of
studious attention.
He studied it exclusively at the week-end.
determining at last to contrive an accidental
meeting with Selina.
Ignoring Murty’s good-intentioned advice,
he arrived at the post office much earlier than
the time specified. There was no sign of
Mr. Quinch, though the publican on the
opposite side of the road remarked that he
had mistaken Mat for that person in the
distance —it was about Quinch’s time to be
down again. To this a bystander added that
there was no fool like an old fool, and an-
other subjoined that “there ought to be a
law against it.” Which evidence that the
projected mesalliance was public property,
together with the fact that a knot of idlers
had collected in front of the two places, em-
bittered Conyers against the whole com-
munity.
A little before 3 o’clock Selina Saddler rode
up. Half-a-dozen hopeful rustics made a

Lame in the morning! A dull, throbbing backache all
day long! Worn out and discouraged when evening
comes And to-morrow —the same old round of suffer-
ing! It s little wonder that one is nervous and dispirited.
Yet to endure such misery is both foolish and unnecessary.
You want to be well, and the quickest way to get well is
to find the cause of your trouble and correct it. More than
likely its your kidneys. That dull, nagging backache
may be Nature s first warning of some hidden kidney
weakness. You may have headaches and dizziness, too,
with sharp, stabbing pains, a depressed, nervous feeling,
and annoying bladder irregularities. Help your weakened
kidneys before it is too late. Use Doan s Backache
Kidney Pills. Doan s have helped thousands and should
help you. Ask your neighbors!
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and the kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish Baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. lam fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I .never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”
TWO SYDNEY
PEOPLE

BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mm M. Whitbread, sen., ‘Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says: For years I suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to he up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. I
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to me
to try this remedy. I got some, and it proved a blessing, giving
quick relief, and gradually effecting a perfect cure. I feel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.”

move forward to hold her horse, and as
many more were ready to lift her off, which
gave Conyers the impression that they were
all on the same errand as himself. Fie un-
hooked his horse, mounted, and rode off
slowly along the road she had come. In a
quarter of a mile the road dipped deep down
into a small gully. Here he pulled up, un-
buckled his girths, and put in half-an-hour
fixing and re-fixing his saddle-cloth. Then
lie commenced to search for pebbles in his
horse’s hoofs, and was so engaged when
Selina at last rode down the hill. Flis aped
surprise at seeing her was superb.
"Is it really you!” he cried with stress
on the dissyllable.
“It’s really me,” she answered. “You’re
quite a stranger, Mat.” Her eyes were
bright and merry as she gave him her gloved
hand, with a quizzical expression on her
radiant face that had often charmed him at.
Dulla squattage, away up on happy Logan
River, ages and ages ago, it seemed to Con-
yers. He held her hand much longer than
was necessary, and squeezed it in a way that
wasn’t necessary at all.
“That is my misfortune,” he rejoined. “But
it’s not my fault. I’ve strained my eyes
lookin’ for you.”
“Have you? And is this the first time
you’ve seen me to-day?”
“The first time for months —or is it years?”
“Oh, you fibber! I saw you back there
at the hotel.”
“Did you?”—with unruffled serenity.
“Well, you didn’t show it.”
“Oh ! You did see me, then?”
"Of course, I saw you. I was waitin’ for
you. I wanted to have a talk with you, but
I had no chance there with all those gallant
jokers hangin’ around.”
“I thought it strange that you should go
a way without speaking.”
“Strange!” Conyers iterated. “For me
to do a thing like that would be most re-
markable. Surprising. It would be more
like me to travel a thousand miles to see you.”
“A thousand yards!” Selina said 'with
cynical emphasis. But she smiled so sweetly
that Conyers at once raised the limit.
“Five thousand miles!” he said. “If you
asked me I’d walk it barefooted over cobble-
stones.”
Selina did not speak for a moment. Then
she said :
"Mat, how far do you call it from here
to Dulla ?”
“About a hundred miles.”
“I left a love of a parrot there. It was
out of its cage, and I couldn’t find it when
I was coming away. Would you go up and
get it for me?”
“Eh?” The jump from the romantic to
the practical w r as startling.
“Would you go up and get it for me—sav,
next week!” She spoke seriously, as though
she had every confidence in Conyers.
“Er —are you sure it’s still there?” he
parried.
"Oh, it s there. Mrs. Carson wrote and
told me.” She stopped as a clatter of hoofs
sounded behind them. “It’s Mr. Quinch,”
she said in a low voice.
Conyers hardly knew at the moment
whether Mr. Quinch or the parrot was the
more unwelcome; but the slight shade of
annoyance that overspread his companion’s
i pretty face somewhat reconciled him to the
position.
Mr. Quinch was a big man, physically and
socially, being a pastoral magnate and a
J.r. But his beauty was marred by a
polished lane across his summit, and a boil-
like wart behind his ear; and he wore a
wispy billygoat beard that was nearly white
with honored years.
“Just a few minutes too late to catch you,”
he announced as he drew up on the near-side.
"And how’s the little girl?” He patted her
on the shoulder in a fatherly fashion, look-
ing under her hat, his red face wreathed in
smiles. The little girl said: “Quite well,
thank you ; and how are you, Mr. Quinch ?”
Mr. Quinch informed her he was never better
in his life, and inquired about the welfare
of her “ma” and her “pa,” after which he
noticed Mr. Conyers for the first time.
“Good day. Conyers.”
“Good day. Quinch.”
The old gentleman’s head went up with a
jerk. Mat had always, with due deference,
called him Mr. Quinch when he was break-
ing-in for him on Pintpot squattage, and
whenever he had met him since. He did
not speak again for a quarter of a mile.
Then he asked :
"Going our w r ay, Conyers?”
"I’m going Miss Saddler’s way, Quinch,”
Conyers answered.
The squatter’s head went more rigidly
erect, and with one fat hand doubled on his
bulky thigh, and his gaze fixed 15 degrees
above the horizon, he rode along whistling,
whilst his companions talked in secret with
their stirruped feet. It was plain that the
big man considered it impertinent for Con-
yers to continue in their company, instead of
politely retiring. Conyers, on the other
hand, regarded Mr. Quinch as a presump-
tuous interloper. But what was troubling
him was that he must eventually surrender
Lena to the usurper. He was not welcome
at Saddler’s. He was sure he would not be
asked in if lie went to the house; and he
was wondering how he could withdraw with-
out Quinch having the laugh at him, when
that gentleman made a false move and played
into his hands.
The bottom fence of Saddler’s big paddock
was just in front. Conyers nudged Selina,
and signed to her to keep close beside him.
By this mfeans he drew her a little to one
side, so that Quinch pulled up at the right
end of the sliprails. They waited for him
to get off; but Mr. Quinch wasn’t in a hurry.
His gaze came down out of the atmosphere,
and fixed languidly on the obstruction.
"You’re the youngest. Conyers,” he sug-
gested.
“You’re the oldest, Quinch,” Mat returned.
“And you’re the nearest, Mr. Quinch,”
Selina added, sweetly.
Mr. Quinch saluted, and responded with
fine gallantry : “It’s a pleasure to put down
sliprails for you, Miss Saddler.”
Fie put them down, and when he had led
his horse over he stood by, and as soon as
Selina was through he slipped them up in
Conyers’s face. He chuckled with satisfac-
tion as he rejoined Selina, who had ridden
on.
“The rouseabout’s not as smart as he
thought he was,” he remarked.
Selina glanced over her shoulder, and her
pink cheeks went scarlet. Conyers sat on
the wrong side of the fence, his leg thrown
over the pommel, twisting his moustache. A
little farther on she glanced at him again,
then suddenly wheeled round and rode back.
“Let me through, Mat,” she requested. Her
eyes flashed angrily, and there was a firm
set about her lips. “We’ll ride round to the
top sliprails,” she added.
Mat obeyed with an alacrity that aston-
ished his horse. His head for the moment
whirled with the intoxication of a lover’s
triumph.
“I would never have thought that of Mr.
Quinch,” she went on, as they rode away.
“He was very rude.”
“He’s an old pig,” Mat declared viciously.
Mr. Quinch remained where she had left
him ; he stood looking after them for several
minutes, then cantered on up the paddock.
For a little while Selina watched him with
a troubled face. Then she shook off the
cloud and said: “Now, about my parrot,
Mat.”
Mat’s ego had been soaring away up in
the firmament. It came back to earth with
a sickening drop.
“Let me see,” she went on meditatively.
“If you meet me at the post office this day
week I’ll bring you a letter for Mrs. Carbon.
Then if you start away next morning, you
could be back by the following Saturday.
Couldn’t you?”
“Ye-es,” Mat admitted, grudgingly. “But
wouldn’t it be better to write to Mrs. Carson
first?”
“Why?” For a moment her beautiful eyes
were fixed wonderingly on his contemplative
countenance.
“To make sure that it hasn’t died from
neglect since you left,” said Conyers.
Selina laughed. “Mrs. Carson would have
let me know if it had.”
"It’s no use,” thought Conyers. “I’m
booked for that blamed parrot.”
She explained how he was to feed it, and
what he was to do in varying weathers and
temperatures, while Mat endeavored to look
pleasant and interested in parrot culture.
By this time they had crossed the boun-
dary. Mat now made the most of his time
to the house-paddock gate, which was hidden
from the house by a clump of wattle. This
was the end of his tether. He opened the
gate slowly, inquiring meanwhile who made
it: he shut and fastened it with a deliberate
care that indicated great respect for gates,
and would gladly have leaned on it for the
rest of the day, and talked about the sub-
lime scenery in her father’s paddock. But
Selina did not dally. A final word or two
of no consequence to anybody else, a linger-
ing grip of hands across the interesting gate,
while their eyes told secrets that their
tongues would utter some other time, and
they parted. Selina cantered briskly home-
ward, and Mat rode leisurely back, thinking
tenderly of an absent yet obtrusive bird. But
there was the consoling thought that Lena
was his for the asking, and it was Mr. Mal-
colm Quinch who was wasting time.
He was half-way to the sliprails w T hen
Long Hugh Saddler, mounted on Quinch’s
sweat-stained horse, rode out of a patch of
scrub and intercepted him. Long Hugh was
a solidly-built, powerful man, with thick
brown beard and small fierce eyes. He

Cong Hugh was bolting close behind, still
swinging the whip, and threatening dire
consequences when he got near enough; so
the leader turned and continued its bolting
career along the fence. It was a substantial
two-rail fence that offered no facilities for
getting through in a hurry.
They turned the corner, and measured the
top line with giant strides. Long Hugh be-
gan to drop back before the next corner was
reached, and derisive roars and thunderous
whipcracks now added to the clatter and
crash of hoofs over the brittle dead wood
and dry bark. The back line ran into a deep
lagoon. Conyers ran into it, too, taking a
great leap that carried him head under and
lost him his hat. Long Hugh pulled up at
the bank, and cracked his whip again. Then
he wheeled his horse round and galloped
away.
Conyers was not discouraged. He per-
suaded himself that it was better to avoid a
conflict than to thrash his girl’s father. She
would never forgive him if he did that. But
he hoped she would not be told how he
escaped from committing that unpleasant-
ness.
On the following Saturday he was at the
meeting place in good time. A crowd of
people were gathered about the pub—a jovial
crowd that spread across the road. Selina
was not among them, but there was a letter
for him at the post office. Lolling against a
post he read it.
Dear Mr. Conyers,—This is to tell you that all i-
over between us, as I have decided to respect mv
father’s wishes, so you must not seek to meet me
again.—Yours truly, Selina Saddler.
The first reading of that epistle left Mr.
Conyers in a cold sweat; with the second
perusal he recovered a little; the third scru-
tiny left him quite comfortable, and a sub-
sequent study evoked a cunning grin.
“You’re a little bit too previous, Mr.
Saddler,” he remarked. “We haven’t got
that far yet—an’ you’ve left out the d—d
parrot.”
His reflections were interrupted by a man
who approached him from a group on the
road.
“Why weren’t you at Quinch’s wedding
to-day, Mat?” he asked. “You missed all
the fun.”
Mat turned cold again; and then he
noticed that the road was white with rice.
“I didn’t know anything about it,” he said
in a harsh voice.
“He married Hughie Saddler’s sister at the
pub _ here to-day,” the man informed him.
“Selina’s aunt, you know. Did it grand,
too. Gave a great spread to everybody, an’
left a fiver in the bar for the crowd to swamp.
You’ve missed a treat.”
“Blast it!” muttered Conyers, in a self-
castigating whisper. “I’ve gone and made
an enemy of my prospective rich uncle-in-
law through listenin’ to idle gossip.”
