CONVICTS AND BUSHMEN
Those who dislike being descended
from convicts will find Russel Ward’s
The Australian Legend (Oxford Uni-
versity Press) somewhat disconcert-
ing, for it is Ward’s theory that
we all do: not physically, but
spiritually. No doubt it is some conso-
lation that in Ward’s view the convict
very quickly became the Noble Bush-
man, and it is this more respectable
figure we can quite legitimately claim
as our national ancestor; but the
convict walks close behind him.
The question is, if the “national
character,” so far as such an imponder-
able can be discussed at all, is inde-
pendent, democratic, resourceful, sus-
picious of Englishmen and policemen,
loyal to its mates, etc., how did it get
to be so? Obviously it is easy enough
to trace all this, except the suspicion
of Englishmen, to the convicts; and
even that, according to Ward, is readily
explained by the large proportion of
Irish among the convicts.
The national “hero,” Ward admits,
is not a convict but a bushman. But
the convicts were the first bushmen.
They worked on stations up the
country, and when, either as prisoners
or as emancipists, they moved from
job to job they established the
nomadic pattern of life—and also
certain patterns of thought and be-
havior —which the shearers and the
drovers were afterwards to follow. It
was the free bushmen, whether des-
cended from convicts or not, who were
to capture the popular imagination, but
it was the convicts who established
the tradition in which they were to
live.
There is, of course, nothing very
new in all this. But the emphasis on
the convicts is fresh enough, and the
strength of the book is in its resolute
following of a clear line of thought,
by means of which Ward is able to
correct the views of some other his-
torians. His argument, for instance,
against the opinion that the flood of
immigrants in the gold-rushes over-
whelmed or “swamped” the earlier
convict-bushman tradition, is very
clearly and persuasively stated:—
First, it can be said with cer-
tainty that they [the bushmen] in-
fluenced the newcomers a great deal
more than they were influenced by
them. That this should be so was
inherent in the situation. Though
the total number of new immigrants
was, in Victoria, so overwhelming,
their arrival was spread over ten
years and each gold-seeker, on land-
ing, found himself a single indi-
vidual, or one of a small party, in
a strange land . . .
Part of Ward’s purpose in this book,
having established from old bush
songs, histories and memoirs, etc., that
the bushman did become the Australian
“culture hero,” is to defend the validity
of that tradition in the modem world,
both in literature and the national life;
and here, too (though “remittance-
men” seems a little unkind), he argues
clearly and sensibly:—
We have seen that the Australian
tradition is as old as our history.
We have seen that it perpetuates as
ideals the qualities which were
characteristic of, and esteemed by,
those first and worst, or best, Aus-
tralians who, at the advancing edge
of settlement, did rather more than
their share to make our country what
it is. Most of us, even if we would,
could not disown its influence com-
pletely. The few who labor earnestly
to do so succeed chiefly in
strengthening it by providing, all un-
wittingly, a patently bogus latter-day
substitute for the pedigreed “new-
chum swells” and remittance-men of
the last century . . . Today’s task
might well be to develop those
features of the Australian legend
which still seem valid in modem con-
ditions.
Revised from a doctoral thesis, “The
Australian Legend” remains essentially
an academic work, with a dry and
factual style and much marshalling of
evidence —one piece of which, about
white men who used to “sleep all night
with a Lubra (Native Female) and if
she poxes him or in any way offends
him perhaps shoot her before 12 next
day,” Ward should have scrutinised
more closely. It has not the liveliness
and color one would have expected
from the author’s interest in old bush
songs; but, taking it on its own terms,
it is a sturdy contribution to clear
thought about our origins and tradi-
tions.
Wild People
Roland Robinson’s Black-feller,
White-feller (Angus and Robertson) is
two books in one; both short, both
excellent.
The first is a collection of tales of
wild people in wild places—short-
stories from the Northern Territory.
What makes them so striking is a
certain wildness in the writer himself,
that intensity of feeling which is also
seen in his poetry.
One of these tales is “Clara,” which
one remembers from earlier printings
in “The Bulletin” and various
anthologies, a story of an easygoing
lubra valued beyond her worth by her
white lover; and, as before, it leaves
one full of admiration for the two
outstanding elements of Roland
Robinson’s artistry; the half-humorous,
half - compassionate accuracy with
which he observes the aboriginal
character; and the touch of wildness
which lifts the story into poetry: —
Yet Murray knew how Clara
affected Collins. He remembered
how some visitors had given the
lubras cast-off clothing. Clara got an
old colored print dress. She would
wear it to work in, to lie down in, in
the shade at the back of the kitchen,
with the dogs and the cats. The
dress was soon dirty and falling
apart, but it took Murray’s breath
away to watch her walking, moving
about in that torn flame of a dress,
with that savage, careless dignity of
hers, with her thin face with high
cheekbones under the wild cloud of
her hair.
Another story, “Mary Lindsay,” is
an even more remarkable achievement;
for here, reversing the situation of
“Clara,” Roland Robinson deals with
the difficult and perilous theme of a

TRANSPORT ESSENTIALS
of the fevered discussion of
road casualties and measures for
preventing them rhay at least come
pressure which will compel transport
authorities to make a cardinal attempt
"to find an overall solution of the
traffic problem.
So far they seem to have been
engaged mostly in creating devices by
which they can avoid facing it; in
hurried bits of sensational action,
nearly all negative and prohibitive.
Instead of telling themselves what
must be done in an orderly and large-
scale way, they involve themselves in
huge waste of breath applied to the
task of telling the public what it must
not do and what will happen to it if
it misbehaves.
Most cities have their traffic prob-
lems, though some less than others;
and so have most rural areas; but
Sydney is the queen of them all, and
has reached the point at which it might
be defined from a communication point
of view as a double ring of bottlenecks
entirely surrounded by traffic-jams.
As an example of how things ought
not to be done, it is a prototype for a
motorists’ bedlam. Recognising years
ago that the provision of through
thoroughfares which could quickly
clear all city cross-traffic, and particu-
larly ingoing and outgoing freight-
traffic, inter-State and otherwise, was a
vital necessity, the authorities froze
wide belts of valuable residential terri-
tory on the city approaches, withdraw-
ing it, in effect, from the control of the
owners and from development. These
belts were to be turned into express-
ways. But after a decade nothing has
been done.
The ferries are a natural mode of
travel for a very large section of the
Sydney population. But in the interest
of bridge-tolls and bus, tram and
suburban train traffic, the State Gov-
eminent has gone all-out to kill the
ferry services, the running of which
is a disgrace, there being no real
co-ordination between the boat services
and the feeder-bus and tram services,
no system of “through” fares or season-
tickets and very little courtesy.
To get from a point on, say,
Cremorne, 20 minutes from the Post
Office, it is necessary to expend 40 to
50 minutes, including waiting-times, in
making three connections and to pay
three separate fares, amounting in all
to 2s. If four people are travelling
from this near-suburb into the city it
is cheaper (even with bridge-toll) to
take a taxicab, and this procedure
can represent up to half-an-hour in
gain of time.
'T'HIS is a small facet of the matter,
A but it is through detail that the
efficiency of a service can be judged. A
hundred similar details tell nearly the
whole story of N.S.W. city transport,
as of country transport, which is one
of defeat, retreat, timidity, fuss and
futility.
Mr. Cahill’s Government spent
millions on a station at Circular
Quay, for instance, designed to link
with the ferry services which are now
nearly dead, thanks to the efforts of
the road-transport exterminators.
But this is not all. For while intent
on the job of destroying Harbor trans-
port as the railway systems set-out to
destroy coastal - shipping transport
(with the help of the Communist-led
Seamen’s and Waterside Unions, both
ardent supporters of the Government
and Socialism), the transport czars of
N.S.W. in particular, and of some other
States in general, have been apparently
on the run from a horde of active
enemies who are cleaning the bones of
public enterprise in sheer self-defence.
The basis of this situation seems to
lie in two compartments.
One lies in the fact that public
transport has become so inefficient,
irregular, dear and uncomfortable, due
to overcrowding and rough discourtesy
of employees who think that the
services are run for their benefit and
not for those of the public, that .users
have been progressively forced to find
other means of carrying themselves,
and a new generation is growing-up
which never sets foot in a public
vehicle unless absolutely compelled to
do so.
The other lies in the fact that the
authorities have met this situation on
the run. Their remedy for shrinking
revenue largely brought about by high
fares and inadequate services is to raise
fares again and make the services more
infrequent.
This process has been going on for
years. The attitude of the N.S.W.
Transport Department is shown by the
report of the commissioner for 1957.
In this the theory on which the depart-
ment works was stated in the most
candid manner. The total number of
passengers carried by the Sydney-
Newcastle transport systems in 1956-57.
declined 71 million, or 21.9 per cent.
The commissioner announced that
“this decrease is much heavier than
the rate of the continual downward
trend in passenger traffic experienced
in recent years, due to an immediate
decline in travel which was experi-
enced when fares were increased on
July 1, 1956.” And then he added
that “despite the additional loss of
passengers, the higher fares are yield-
ing extra revenue to an extent which
completely justifies their introduction.”
With 71-million fewer passengers
the department collected an overall
£3.5 million more in revenue from
passengers and subsidiary sources.
The condition of affairs existing in
Sydney in busy hours is typified by
the fact that in a bad traffic-jam just
before Christmas Day in Queen’s
Square, on the approaches to the
Sydney eastern suburbs, two-thirds of
the vehicles involved were taxi-cabs;
unbelievable as it may seem, only three
buses and one tram.
ALL these are local details, but they
typify the official attitude of all
traffic authorities to the whole problem.
There is no doubt that the huge roll
of deaths and accidents on Australian
roads is a matter for seripus remedial
operations, but they must begin at the
right end, which is the transport con-
ditions themselves. The greatest per-
centage of deaths does not occur in the
thick congestion of slow, controlled
traffic, which is, however, responsible
for enormous wear-and-tear on vehicles
and nerves and enormous waste of
money on petrol in starting and
stopping. It occurs on the badly-
planned, badly-cambered and -graded,
bad-visibility outer highways, of which
the surfaces are often like those of a
choppy sea congealed into bitumen.
There are two essentials in the solu-
tion of the traffic problem. They apply
in all States, and all authorities agree
on the first, which was stated a few
days ago by the secretary of the Aus-
tralian Automobile Association, the
general-secretary of the N.R.M.A. and
the Professor of Highway Engineering
at the N.S.W. University. All con-
curred that an improved road-system
is the first step towards the reduction of
accidents. And the first step of the
reduction of density. of congestion is
the provision of cheap, efficiently run,
adequate public - transport systems
adaptable to the areas which they are
supposed to serve.
Services which would make it
worth while for owners to leave their
cars at home instead of choking-up
the city with them and which would
make the taxi-cab an emergency
vehicle.


"VIVE LA FRANC!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
France's Crucial Year
A main historic feature —perhaps the
main • historic feature—of European
developments in 1959 will centre round
what happens in Paris in the next six
months before the Berlin issue comes to
a crisis.
Berlin has probably been deferred as
a showdown issue until May in order to
see what can be done about France in the
meantime. To weaken France, to prevent
success by de Gaulle in his plans, to
disrupt Nato, to promote a. quarrel
between Western Germany and France
and Britain will be tasks set firmly for
every one of France’s millions of Com-
munists and their stooges. If their cam-
paign proceeds, and especially if France
can be detached from Nato, Europe will
face the grim issue in May with a
sick heart.
De Gaulle takes office as President on
January 8 and hands over the Premier-
ship. In the meantime the features of
his policy have been fairly clearly defined.
He aims at independence of policy with
co-operation in action with the neighbor-
ing nations of the Common Market and
the European Payments Union. The
devaluation of the franc seems to have
been designed to bring it into line with
the West German mark for common-
market reasons.
His general economic programme
aims at strict austerity while France
pulls itself out of a mire which is not
so sticky as it seems because, whatever
standards rule in general, the country
at least has less unemployment than any
other in Europe and is virtually self-
supporting in food.
The difficulties will mainly come from
the Left. The great C.G.T. trade-union
federation, a ferine body, Communist-
do'minated and with about the same
principles as the Australian Waterside
Workers’ Federation, is already in full
cry against the austerity measures. These
call for freezing of wages, combined with
increase in real prices of fuel, food and
fares in the middle of winter and for cuts
in some social-security benefits. The
plans are being held up as brutal Fascist
measures of a kind which every Com-
munist is bound to resist—save when
they happen to be taken in Russia.
The new defence programme is
streamlined to provide both for modern
methods of defence against external
enemies in firm integral co-operation with
Nato, and equally firm internal defence
in collaboration between the defence-
forces and the police. This also will have
resistance as a measure liable to mobilise
the worker in time of emergency and
war.
The whole system of control is
designed to be tight, quickly operated and
modern—in fact, it very much resembles
the Kremlin’s own system, but it natur-
ally outrages the Communists. They
affect to regard it as a warmongering
scheme aimed against peace-lovers like
Mr. Gromyko, who believes that the
simple issue of whether West Berlin
should remain free in accordance with
its electors’ almost unanimous vote, or
be engulfed behind the Iron Curtain,
could lead to World War 111, in which
the U.S.S.R. would destroy England and
France in a single day, or perhaps even a
single hour. Including, of course, such
of the Communists as happened to be
present in the West when the bombs
began to fall.
For the mugs who are now doing his
work in France, Comrades Gromyko
and Khrushchev have no sympathy.
They appear to take it for granted that
if they are genuine they will willingly
sacrifice themselves for the cause of
Russian world conquest when the matter
comes to trial.
De Gaulle, if he can point this out
clearly enough, should certainly have an
argument on his side which will appeal
even to Comrade Thorez, the French
Communist leader. But he also has other
and more direct arguments, and it
remains to be seen whether their practical
application will keep France long enough
stable to put the new Constitution and
economic policies on their feet.
It is a task in which the whole of the
West has an interest. In de Gaulle’s
success may depend the fate of the world.
Revolutionary violence would certainly
lead to Russian intervention, direct or
indirect, and to the disruption of Nato.
Knighthood in Flower
[From Canberra]
If ever permanent heads of Government
departments call a round-table confer-
ence between themselves it will be like
the Knights of the Round Table again.
No fewer than five reigning heads of
senior Commonwealth Departments have
now been elevated to knighthoods.
They are the chairman of the Public
Service Board (Sir William Dunk), the
Secretary of the Treasury (Sir Roland
Wilson), the Solicitor-General (Sir
Kenneth Bailey), the of the
Department of Trade (Sir John Craw-
ford) and the Commissioner for Taxation
(Sir Patrick McGovern).
Up till a few weeks ago the secretary
of the Prime Minister’s Department was
also a knight —Sir Allen Brown, who has
retired to become Deputy High Commis-
sioner in London.
Sir John Crawford and Sir Patrick
McGovern have just been elevated to the
higher ranks, following the publication
of the New Year’s honors list.
All of the departmental knights have
been created on the suggestion of the
Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies).
Mr. Menzies is also xvell surrounded
by knights in the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment.
There are two in the Ministry—the
Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick)
and the Minister for Repatriation (Sir
Walter Cooper).
Other, knights in the Parliament are
the former Attorney-General (Sir Neil
O’Sullivan), a former Minister for Health
(Sir Earle Page) and a former Minister
for the Interior (Sir Wilfrid Kent
Hughes), whom Mr. Menzies sacked
from the Ministry after the 1955 elections.
S,ir Wilfrid got his- knighthood on the
recommendation of the Victorian Gov-
ernment in recognition of his services as
chairman of the organising committee of
the 1956 Olympic Games.
A further five' knights have retired
from Parliament in recent years—Sir
Arthur Fadden, Sir Philip Mcßride, Sir
Eric Harrison, Sir Josiah Francis and
Sir Percy Spender.
Convertibility and Trade
[From Canberra] A
Commonwealth trade authorities are not
greatly worried about anything that might
happen to Australian trade following
Britain’s recent decision to make sterling
more freely convertible.
They believe that Australia’s three
major primary-production exports —wool,
wheat and meat —will hold their own on
tlje British market.
However, there is a fear that Austra-
lian canned fruits will be hard-hit.
Overall, the decision, which is only
limited and does not mean complete
convertibility, should not greatly affect
Australia’s balance of trade with Britain,
though foreign countries may choose not
to buy in the sterling area with the
proceeds they obtain from selling to it.
It was pointed out in Canberra that
Australia’s exports of both meat and
wheat are covered by - bilateral agree-
ments between Australia and Britain.
Meat exports are protected by the 15-
year meat agreement between the two
countries.
In any event, America has never been
a great meat-exporter to the U.K., and
even with the easier access to dollars as
a result of the convertibility move, it
is not expected to result in Britain seek-
ing more meat from that market.
Similarly with wheat. Australia’s ex-
ports are covered by the Australia-U.K.
trade-agreement, and even though Britain
buys large quantities of Canadian wheat
it is not expected to increase these pur-
chases at the expense of Australian
exporters.
Wool will hold its predominant posi-
tion on the British market because
Britain knows that Australia’s wool is
the best type for her particular require-
ments.
Again, America has never been a threat
as a competitor, and is not expected to
become one now.
* The easier access to the American
market is expected, however, to result
in much larger British imports of
American canned fruits at Australia’s
expense.
America has set a world standard for
canned goods, and because of their com-
parative unavailability in recent years,
a big swing to them is expected with
the easier procurement of dollars.
All in all, Australia has been prepared
for Britain’s move and has not been
caught napping, and, consequently, does
not fear any serious repercussions on
her trade relations with the U.K.


New Regime in Cuba
Events in Cuba’s two-year-old rebellion
moved to a sudden climax last xveek. On
December 30 it was reported that rebel
leader Fidel Castro’s troops were making
an all-out effort to capture the city of
Santa .Clara, chief town of the sugar-
growing province of Las Villas. Till then
their activities had been confined to
guerrilla tactics. With planes, tanks and
artillery at their disposal the Govern-
ment troops seemed likely soon to have
the situation under control, and President
Batista was reported to be going into the
battle-zone himself in order to encourage
his army.
As the year ended Government spokes-
men were announcing that the attack on
Santa Clara had failed, but Castro’s rebel
radio was claiming large-scale defections
among Government troops, and the fact
that Government planes had bombed five
towns in Las Villas province suggested
that the revolt was spreading. When
President Batista’s two young sons unex-
pectedly arrived in New York by air
Cuban officials denied that their trip
indicated that Batista’s regime was
tottering. A day later it was no longer a
question of its tottering. It had fallen,
and Batista and his closest associates
were seeking asylum in the Dominican
Republic.
Riots and looting in Havana followed
Batista’s flight, and a provisional Gov-
ernment proclaimed by his former col-
leagues was immediately rejected by
Fidel Castro, who demanded the appoint-
ment of Dr. Manuel Urrutia as pro-
visional President. This was acceded to,
and Urrutia was formally inaugurated in
Santiago ; he named Castro as chief of
the armed forces.
Either as puppet-master or actual
President, Batista had been dictator of
Cuba for 25 years, and his regime had
been increasingly charged with corrup-
tion and oppression. Fidel Castro led an
abortive revolt in 1953, later fled the
island and returned two years ago to
begin the now successful rising. He
claims his object is to end corruption and
to give Cuba a freely elected Govern-
ment as soon as possible.
Successful revolutionaries in other
Latin American countries have often
said the same thing, only to fall into the
same ways as the dictators they have
overthrown. It is to be hoped that Castro
may prove an exception. The denuncia-
tion by Dr. Urrutia of the dictators of
Paraguay, Nicaragua and the Dominican
Republic gives hope that he may be.
Whales and Whaling
[From Canberra]
The Commonwealth Director of
Fisheries, F. F. Anderson, holds fears
for Australia’s whaling interests if Russia
goes ahead with its plans to build four
or five large factory-ships for Antarctic
whaling-operations.
Mr. Anderson, who is the Common-
wealth’s representative on the Inter-
national Whaling Commission, said the
Russians had announced they were build-
ing four or five factory-ships to replace
the old vessel, Slava, which had operated
in the Antarctic for the past 10 years.
“Russia’s move would mean their
catching-potential would be increased
enormously and whales would be caught
much quicker.
“If the Russians catch more whales
quicker than other nations, it will be-
come uneconomic for those other coun-
tries to compete.
“The whole tendency will be to break
the International Whaling Agreement and
will mean that whaling in Australian
waters will be finished in a few seasons,”
he said.
Stocks of whales off the Australian
coast would diminish quickly.
Australia at present operates five
whaling - stations at Norfolk Island,
Byron Bay, Moreton Bay, Carnarvon
and Albany.
The gravest danger to Australia will
be that once the international conven-
tion is broken, there will be no restric-
tion on the taking of whales by factory-
ships in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
This will lead to a return to the con-
ditions prior to the 1949 International
Whaling Agreement, when Norwegian
and other whalers operated at will off
the Australian coast.
S
Why Kent Hughes Went Out
Scant attention has been paid to the
statement made in Melbourne by Sir
Wilfrid Kent Hughes on intriguing public
servants in Canberra; and this is not
genuinely surprising, since it has become
depressingly clear in recent years that
the people and Federal Cabinets have
become reconciled to being bossed
around by Canberra bureaucrats.
The dismissal of Bifly Kent Hughes
from the Federal Cabinet in 1956 wais,
nevertheless, one of the political sur-
prises of the year.
He is by no means the easiest of
fellows for some to get on with ; but a
penchant for more-or-less openly criticis-
ing the Prime Minister on other than
Cabinet matters and occasional seemingly
autocratic acts were not, overall, serious
disqualifications. His meddling in
External A.ffairs was a mistake, but it was
magnified because he was unpopular with
the public service.
Kent Hughes was silent about his dis-
missal ; but lately, following criticism of
his administration after the removal of
his Ministerial successor as well, Allen
Fairhall, he issued a statement which
indicated, without saying it, that he might
have been a very-well-thought-of Minis-
ter indeed if he had toed the civil-
service line.
He was clearly hamstrung in many
ambitious efforts, and he complains of
frustrations and difficulties.
When he had the work on the con-
struction of the administrative building
speeded-up so that Commonwealth
departments could be transferred to
Canberra, Cabinet decided further
inquiries were necessary and appointed
a public-service committee to investi-
gate. After two years the committee
recommended that the Defence Depart-
ment should be the first to move to
Canberra, not the last, as had been
scheduled in Sir Wilfrid’s speed-up
campaign.
In the course of the two years, the
speed-up plan was quickly forgotten, and
the Minister was taught a sharp lesson
about who is in charge in Canberra.
Clearly it is not the Federal Cabinet;
appointing a public-service committee on
anything inevitably means long delays
and a report calculated to suit precisely
the needs of the public service, and
appointing a public-service committee on
a speed-up plan was manifestly weak.
For a Few Votes
In the last three years the Victorian
Housing Commission has taken-over, or
prepared to take-over, 83 acres for slum-
reclamation in inner Melbourne, and in
the last financial year it spent £536,000 on
slum-clearance.
Plans for reclamation are being pre-
pared for areas in Fitzroy, Carlton, North
Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Richmond,
•Prahran, Collingwood, Williamstown,
Clifton Hill, and also, probably, South
Melbourne.
Decisions to resume whole blocks of
houses, some of which are as admirably
kept as those of the upper-crust who
can still afford gardeners and repair-bills
for private houses, naturally provide a
target for those who wish to nark
admirable projects. There is a slight
political gain to be wrung from the
anguish of those dispossessed of their
dwellings until new ones are built, if
they do not wish to move to other Com-
mission homes.
Dr. James Cairns, the Federal mem-
ber for Yarra, the former policeman and
former young white hope of the A.L.P.,
has been engaged in raising the hopes of
residents of Collingwood, where the
Housing Commission will resume a block
of old houses and replace them with
modern flats.
He has been actively associated with
the hopeless fight of the Collingwood
residents to retain their homes ; and, as
Horace Petty, the Minister for Housing,
has complained, conveniently forgets
local conditions and climbs onto any
and every bandwagon with an eye to
political advantage. He also overlooks
slum-reclamation as a major point in
A.L.P. policy in Victoria, or as a major
point when a block of votes isn’t at stake.
Petty himself, however, is in financial
trouble with slum-reclamation,, since the
ultimate cost of the site is far more
expensive than an alternative in an outer
suburb. Some signals have been received
in Spring Street, however, that the Com-
monwealth is favorably disposed to slum-
reclamation. A possible explanation is
that it may lessen the demand for loans.
Redevelopment of the inner areas will
greatly assist the public utilities whose
services are not being fully used in some
closer-in areas and which cannot afford
to extend their services as rapidly as
houses are being built on Melbourne’s
fringe. The percentage of unsewered
houses in Melbourne is actually in-
creasing.

“Sydney ‘Telegraph’ on January 1 extended,

Oh, children anxious to be born in

You can do it on the “Telegraph,” as

And be a newborn, freeborn son of
Sydney, born for free.
And you to whom the pleasure of engage-
ment is denied
By the cost of the announcement in the
“Herald”-classified,
The “Telegraph” will smooth the course
of free-love to its goal —
At least to the extent of not exacting any
toll.
When, like old-fashioned hagglers for the
bride’s pre-nuptial dot,
The “Herald” won’t bless weddings with-
out linage on the spot,
The “Telegraph” won’t charge you, or
inquire into your means,
But play your wedding-march upon its
linotype-machines.
And when you're tired of living, but you
can’t afford to die
Because the cyst of dying in the “Herald”
is too high,
The “Telegraph” will see you off, and
never count the cost,
Although they know the cost includes
another reader lost.
So here’s to Sydney “Telegraph,” the
paper of the Free,
The pillar both of Sydney’s high and low

And may it freely circulate, and long may
it draw breath,
And.never be recorded in the “Herald’s”

“In the kitchen with the keg ; you know

“Then I’m for the kitchen, too. I can

said the bright young thing, and vanished.
Half-an-hour later the hostess murmured

Gundagai began in the early 1800’s;
selectors of street-names in this hill-town
were no doubt carried away by the
Olympian heights of Mt. Parnassus (the
new town was built around the mountain,
after the old was swept away after the
1852 flood). There is a Homer Street and
Sheridan main-street ; and perhaps the
surveyor felt a bit disgruntled, to call
two other streets Punch and Judy. Then
the plebeian entered with Snake Gully,
near where the Dog-on-the-Tucker-Box
memorial is. Dad and Dave Motors have
selected a corner site that is alluded to
as “Dad and Dave Corner”; so whether
you are a Mt. Parnassus resident, or an

banks of that well-known river, you
belong to a population of Poets and

Of red-faced aggression —-

If you'd skim-off the big-business cream.

Will make you feel bolder
And pilot you right on the beam.

Don’t be backward in doing your block.

Keeps customers happy,
So go off, at all times, half-cock.

That he’ll take rich delight in
A red-blooded fight in

With the rest. This could possibly buy
You the boot; or, conversely, supply
The singular notion
You merit promotion —
It’s worth it to give it a fly!

The Phenomenon of Eton.
By JOHN LAFFIN
4 4"you can do anything you
want at Eton,” the
youth in the monkey-jacket
and the big white collar told
me. “I mean, if you want to
be a Socialist, that’s your
business and nobody bothers
you.”
His friend added quickly:
“But, of course, none of the
chaps are Socialists.”
I met the two Eton boys
in a Windsor teashop, and
after I had broken through
their English reserve they
talked freely. I asked if stu-
dents were interested in subjects
less serious than politics.
“Certainly,” one of them
said. “One fellow in the fourth
studies goldfish. And there
was Willoughby. I say, Grey,
do you remember Willoughby?
He had a thing about grass-
hoppers.”
“Odd,” Grey said frowning.
“Wonder what became of
him?”
“Has an Etonian ever gone
wrong?” I asked innocently.
“Gone wrong?” Grey
repeated.
“Ended up in the hoose-
gow?”
“Oh, I say, sir!” the boy
said.
For foreigners, Eton must
be one of the most baffling
aspects of the British way of
life. It was founded by a boy
King, Henry VI, 51 years
before Columbus discovered
America, has triumphantly
survived five violent centuries
of English history, and even
now, in the Atom Age, the
college continues with majestic
self-confidence to do its avowed
job: to train the sons of the
upper-classes to be future
rulers.
1 visited the place on a Sun-
day with parents and relatives
milling discreetly about, trying
to get seats in the magnificent
15th-century chapel. Other
parents were being led by their
sons to teashops in Windsor
High Street. The parents’
attire ranged from that superb
English dowdiness —brown-felt
pot hats, shapeless, colorless
overcoats, sensible shoes —to
the smartest Mayfair elegance.
But they had in common an
eager-to-please air, as if they
were on probation and hoped
their sons would give them
good marks for behavior.
Tourists were taking-in the
beauty of the place—the lovely
old Clock Tower, the Cloisters,
the sunken garden presented
by the King of Siam after his
graduation, the wide green
curve of the playing-fields (on
which Waterloo was won and
India lost), the ivy-covered
Houses where the boys live.
Eton has produced more
Prime Ministers than any other
school in England, apart from
an impressive array of viceroys,
great scholars and inventors
and business magnates. Most
princes go to Eton as a matter
Q f COU rse. A graduate a few
years ago was the Duke of
Kent, simply called “Kent” by
masters and fellow-pupils—
sorry, -scholars. Eton dislikes
tbe wor d “pupils.”
Eton boys are aged between
j 3 and 18 Each boy has his
own room ; a singularly squalid
little room with shabby wall-
paper or dingy paint, an iron

I suppose .”
bed that folds up against the
wall during the day, a wash-
basin (but no running water),
a battered desk which also
doubles as a chest-of-drawers, a
padded cotton-covered storage-
box which can be sat-on,
a table and a chair. The spare
Eton uniform, the one extra
suit and sports-clothes, hang
on hooks behind the door.
There is almost no central-
heating. Each boy is given
one scuttle of coal each week
to burn in his grate. This
means he can be relatively
warm for certain periods on
four days a week.
The boys bathe three times
a week —in unheated bath-
rooms, naturally. They eat
plain, wholesome food, with-
out any trimmings.
By 7.30 in the morning,
before breakfast, they are
already in classes. At 8.20 they
breakfast, make their beds, and
the smaller boys run messages
for the older ones. Then
chapel, followed by four hours
of study.
At 2.30, after dinner, they
have two hours of games, all
arduous, all compulsory. Then
they get their own tea. Privi-
leged upper-school boys have
small-boy fags to get tea for
them. Tea over, study con-
tinues until 8-o’clock, when
the boys have supper, collect
water for their rooms, gossip
and horseplay until it is time
for prayers, followed by baths
on the roster-system. It’s
lights-out at 9.30 for small
boys and at 10-o’clock for
seniors.
All this amounts to a vigor-
ous routine, but nobody ever
complains. The system has
been working for hundreds of
years, so why fiddle with it?
Eton provides more than an
education ; it is a toughening-
up process, a form of dis-
cipline.
The formal education of
Eton, with great emphasis on
Latin, is not merely based on
memorising; the boys are
trained to reason and to judge
from learned facts. They are
taught in classes of 25. A boy
progresses through Eton
according to his brain-power.
A very clever boy could com-
plete his schooling in four
years ; a very slow boy may
take six years.
Old Etonians and Eton
masters themselves admit that
a boy can get a fine classical
education elsewhere, but insist
that Eton school-life is an
invaluable training.
The point is: What is Eton
school-life?
It is an intricate system of
privileges and responsibilities,
managed by the boys them-
selves. At the bottom of the
scale is a small-boy wearing an
Eton-collar and a monkey-
jacket, aged 13, under five-foot-
four in height (taller boys wear
a tailed coat), looking both
harassed and carefree. He is
a fag; for 18 months every
boy who enters Eton is a part-
time servant for some upper-
school boy. If a boy is going
to learn to command, he must
first learn to take orders. This
is Eton logic.
Six small-boys in a room
may be discussing stamps or
study when they hear a loud,
manly voice yelling, “Boy!”
Instantly they run like mad to
the owner of the voice. The
last boy to arrive is given the
job—which may be to take a
note some place, light a fire or
tear along to the village for
a pot of jam. Besides this
impromptu duty each small-
boy has his own fag-master,
for whom he prepares tea and
does the daily room-tidying.
The last recorded case of
rebellion against the system
was in 1801, when a fag threw
a book at his master and told
him to go to the devil. The
boys still talk about this inci-
dent and all believe that the
fag, whose name is not remem-
bered, must have come to an
unhappy end. f
If a fag is too lazy or too
incompetent, or if he breaks a

POLITICAL POINTS
Russia won the moon-rocket race after
all. That’s not strictly right, as their
rocket didn’t hit the moon, but as it
isn’t clear whether it or the American
high-fliers which previously held the
height record were intended to score a
direct hit, the near-miss of 4600 miles
must be conceded for the present to be
as good as a landing. What the Russian
scientists have done is force a man-made
object through the earth’s gravitational
barrier for the first time. Whether their
rocket will become a permanent planet
or fall into the sun remains to be seen.

This will be a year of State elections.
There will be polls in N. S. Wales, South
Australia and Westralia and possibly in
Tasmania. The death last week of A. R.
Fisher, one of the Labor members for
Wilmot in the Tasmanian Assembly,
could upset the balance of parties down
there. The last election resulted in a
dead-heat—Labor, 15 ; Liberals, 15 —and
Parliament has carried-on with a Labor
Government and a Liberal speaker. No
by-election will be held for the Wilmot
vacancy; p.-r. provides for a count-
back among the unsuccessful candidates
at the last poll. It is possible that this
will put a Liberal candidate in Fisher’s
place, in which case the Government’s
majority will disappear.

allotted space with advertisements
lifted . . . from earlier editions
of the “Herald.” It followed this
up by getting an injunction restraining
the proprietors of the “Telegraph” “until
and including January 6 from copying
the whole or any substantial part of the
Births and Deaths columns of the classi-
fied advertisements in the ‘Sydney Morn-
ing Herald.’ ”
When this went to the printer Sydney
people were still being born, becoming
engaged, getting married and dying at
the normal rate for this time of the year.
The European Common Market, link-
ing France, Holland, Belgium, Luxem-
bourg, Italy and West Germany into one
trading unit of ,165 million people, came
into force on January 1.

N.S.W. Opposition - leader Morton
intends to make housing a main issue at
the coming State election. Broadcasting
on Sunday night he attacked the Cahill
Government’s record in the field of
housing, contrasting its achievement with
those of other States. He said the Vic-
torian Liberal Government had in its
first year of office been able to find per-
manent homes for all occupants of
emergency settlements, and the Westra-
lian Labor Government last month closed
its last emergency housing - unit. In
N.S.W., on the other hand, there were
still 2758 emergency housing - units and
a long waiting-list in addition.
Morton said a Liberal-Country-party
Government would face-up to the need
for housing - finance and would under-
take “specific and definite reforms” to
meet it.

With the proclamation of Johore State
as a “white” area the whole of South
Malaya has now been declared free of

H. K. P. Wood, chairman of the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat, replying in an
article in Melbourne “Herald” to criticism
of wool promotion:
....Synthetics promotion is not superior
to that which the I.W.S. is doing. But its
volume carries vast superiority.
Unless we have the funds available to
put-over to the public the old and new
virtues of wool, no promotion, however
brilliant, can hope to compete with the
colossal advertising saturation by the
combined synthetics manufacturers,
As this seems to be what the economists
and advertising experts were saying in
more elegant, or slicker English,
unanimity appears to have been reached.
What now?

Trade-unions are reported to be plan-
ning “an all-out campaign” against penal
provisions in arbitration legislation. An
A.C.T.U. survey is stated to have shown
that since 1956 prosecutions under
Federal legislation have cost unions at
least £9500, including £6OOO for legal
costs. Perhaps someone will run a
counter - campaign, stressing the high
degree of industrial peace in recent years,
and reminding the community how much
past disputes cost everybody in higher
prices and loss of income.

In his New Year message Lord Mayor
Jensen said that Sydney’s population had
now passed the two-million mark and it
was time to think of planning in terms
of the three-million people who would
one day occupy the city. Official esti-
mates placed the population of Sydney
on June 30, 1958, at 2,016,620 and of
the County of Cumberland at 2,094,390.
Those are big figures, but they won’t be
doubted by anyone who tried to do a
spot of last-minute shopping in Sydney
during Christmas week.
At the same time they don’t justify
the claim of the radio-commentator who,
in criticising Sydney’s traffic-problem,
said it was “a disgrace to the largest
city in the Southern Hemisphere.” South
America has three cities with bigger
populations than Sydney—Buenos Aires
(3,673,600), Rio de Janeiro (2,940,000)
and Sao Paulo (3,149,504).

National standards laboratories in
British Commonwealth countries and the
United States have reached agreement on
international values for the yard and the
pound (weight). The change won’t affect
the ordinary measurements of trade and
commerce, but will be of importance to
science and technology in that it will
correct anomalies that have existed
through a slight difference between British
and American standard measurements.
The American yard, for example, is four
parts in a million longer than the
Imperial Standard Yard. It’s not the sort
of difference to affect Olympic records,
but enough to worry the scientists into
making a compromise. They’ve agreed
to split the difference, and the new inter-
national yard which will come into force
on July 1 will be equal to 0.9144 metre.
The international pound needs a few
more decimals for expression ; it will
equal 0.45359237 kilogram.

Tito may not be the white-haired boy
of the Kremlin, but he seems determined
to show that he’s no friend of the West,

occupation of West New Guinea and
calling for an immediate end of all
colonialism in Africa and Asia. “Colonial-
ism” is a kind of swear-word in Afro-
Asian circles, yet if Indonesia were to
take over West New Guinea in its present
stage of development, what would that
be but colonialism? The Dutch inten-
tion is to prepare the natives for eventual
self-government. That is something that
has no part in Indonesian plans.

“Ex-ACT”: Perth has launched
another blitz at Darwin, this time
through assertions that the Federal
Government should cease to preserve
Darwin as a major port of entry for over-
seas air-services. The defence importance
of Darwin is admitted, but Westralians
are claiming that compared with what
Perth has to offer there is no ground for
the claim that large-scale Qantas opera-

national development. It is contended that
Perth is geographically and commercially
the logical gateway to Australia for
modern aircraft from Europe, though it

the two new liners for the Londoh'-
Australia run will be in service by the
end of 1960. They are the Canberra, of
45,000 tons, and the Oriana, of 42,000
tons. The Canberra will carry 2300
passengers, including 1650 in tourist, and
the Oriana slightly fewer. Each ship is
costing about £l4 million, and each will
do some business on the Pacific run,
where the company is thinking very much

ticularly Americans, to see Australia.”

“Mugga Way”: Some naive people
may have been shocked to discover via
that live-wire, independent-minded cuss
“Billy” Kent Hughes that there are some
Canberra public servants given to intrigue.
He gave us a useful reminder that he
had defied the serried ranks of bureau-
cracy in the capital by removing some
of their cherished privileges, including
subsidies for golf and bowling clubs, and
it was disturbing, if not surprising, to
learn that as a Minister he had been
foiled continually “by citizens who com-
plained to someone higher up the scale.”
His successor, Allen Fairhall, has also
bitten the dust after three years in the
portfolio, and the new incumbent,
Gordon Freeth, has now been well and
truly warned. If Kent Hughes is right,
the real assurances should now come
from whoever it is “higher up the scale”
who lent a ready ear, apparently, to the
intriguers.

While Tito, in the Eastern Seas, was

Minister of Ghana, was making similar
utterances in India. In New Delhi, where
he was the guest of Prime Minister Nehru,
he spoke of Ghana as “a springboard for
the final liberation of the African con-
tinent.” As first Prime Minister of a new
nation, Nkrumah has a man-sized job on
his hands already. He is more likely to
win himself an honored place in history
by concentrating on doing that job
well than by indulging in grandiose
dreams of becoming the ruler of an

Going to War I at the age of 15 and
coming back after demob, to finish his
schooling at Sydney Grammar, R. E. G.
Cunningham had quite a bit of experience
under his hat when he started as a
jackeroo. He became a station-manager
in western Queensland and N.S.W. and
followed his chosen occupation as a
grazier until War II got him back again
to the guns, in New Guinea and Borneo.
In 1949 he was selected as an Australian
officer on the Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the United Nations and
was posted to Pakistan, where he
remained until November, 1957.
Cunningham holds strong views on Aus-
tralia’s responsibility to Asia, and also
on possible lessons that we might learn
from experiments carried out in Pakistan.
An article by him is in this week’s “Man

ABORIGINALITIES
OLD CHARLIE ICE-CREAM
YffiiEN we were kids at Broken Hill
(N.S.W.) the heat of the day was
tempered by the bugle-call of old Charlie
Ice-cream, and the tinkling music of the
bells on the harness of the little grey pony
that pulled his cart. Charlie was a
chunky, smallish man, with a spiky well-
waxed moustache, merry black eyes and
swarthy complexion. He wore a red
fez with a black tassel, white apron and
spotless trousers. The sleeves of a white
shirt were rolled to the elbows.
He was one of the colony of ’Ghans
who lived north of the town, just off
the road to the racecourse —a collection
of humpies, which, under today’s health-
laws, would not have been tolerated as
an icecream-factory. Most of the ’Ghans
were camel-teamsters, and a few were
“I suppose it's because We're in the nude."
merchants. But there was 'only one
Charlie.
His cart was gaily painted and had
mirrors let into the raised side-panels.
The canopy was cloth, fringed with
tassels and little bells. Charlie sat in a
kind of well; each side of him, fitted
into holes in a platform, were the ice-
cream-cans packed in crushed-ice. There
were also jars filled with red, yellow and
green jelly, and a can of Turkey-101ly —
sticky, colored sugar-shavings that melted
in the mouth with a delectable sweetness.
Charlie came to our neighborhood
twice a week, and the sound of his bugle
sent us scurrying to the corner of the
street, the hot, gritty sand oozing between
our toes. As we clustered about his cart
with our pennies, Charlie would press
the rich, crisp ice-cream into a cone with
a wooden ladle, keeping up a lively patter
about the virtue of his wares all the time.
A cone cost a penny ; the same for a
twist of Turkey-lolly in a paper twisted
into a dunce’s hat. Only the adults
bought the jelly, which we got for them
in a glass jar—it was not a very popular
line. We sucked Charlie's goodies in
the shade of a pepper-tree that grew in
the sand-drift fronting our corrugated-
iron home. There has never been better
ice-cream.
Charlie also sold a curry-powder for
which mother was a regular customer.
He made the powder and put it up in
small brown-paper packs. The pungency
of it has lingered through the years. He
tried unsuccessfully to teach mother how
to make curry —the result was good to
us kids, but it was Charlie’s despair. I
now know why, for mother used the
powder only as a flavoring, and not as
an ingredient. I also know now that it
was a far better powder than most of
the so-called curry-powders put up today.
Most of the ’Ghans of those years in
Broken Hill were really Punjabi Mussul-
men —or Lahori Afghans. Many of them
returned to northern India when work
for camel-teams faded with the coming
of the motor-truck. There is a settlement
of a few old men, and their descendants,
in a Lahore bazaar known as “Little
Australia.”
Charlie’s ice-cream passed from our
ken as we grew-up, and 1 don’t know
what became of him. It was an icecream-
cart of Charlie’s type (it couid have been
his) that carried the two ’Ghans who
shot-up a picnic-train a few miles west
of Broken Hill on New Year’s Day,
1915. Charlie was not one of them.

“Jeyles”: “Siosal’s” budgerigar (B.

mixed-up with cricket. Busy all day with
mince-pies, etc., in the kitchen, I had

Ten, ten, two, and a quarter was the
Pastoralists’ Union allowance granted to
shed-hands after the strike of 1891. I
never saw that tin of jam or baking-

panied by a few dirty comments, was
barely sufficient to take a swagman to

“Kerba”: Yesterday I weuld have
claimed that the scissors-grinder (fantailed
flycatcher) was the most manoeuvrable
thing in the air, but now I nominate
a dark-horse which in a brief, desperate
encounter made old Scissors look about
as swift and air-graceful as a fat Orping-
ton hen. The pied little skite dived at
the prospective victim, and missed clean.
He wheeled, zoomed, looped in tight
circles, and still failed to con-
nect with his snapping beak.
Finally he broke-off the engage-
ment in disgust, and the
Christmas-beetle ceased his aero-
batics and resumed a straight
course.

really fills you. If there’s no wheat going,
kaoliang flour (sorghum) fills the bill, or
better, millet, which makes steamed cakes
and a passable porridge —if you’re
hungry, that is.

The blokes in the utility, leaving Winton
for Boulia (W.Q.), obliged the drunk,
bound for Macunda, with a lift, and
bundled him into the back. The driver
advised him: “Put your head on that
cardboard box, Mick. It’ll make things
more comfortable. Nothing to damage—
they’re only fox-baits.” When they got
to Macunda, and the still half-sozzled

IT'S A BARBECUE."


Mick got out, the driver blew his top—
the box of baits was open and pieces of
brisket were scattered about. Mick
accepted the guilt: “I was feelin’ hungry.
I didn’t know if you said they was ox-
tails or dried dates. They ain’t neither ;
but they was pretty good eatin’.” He
survived for further sprees—“Gidyea

“Lillydale”: Padasian, the only Kada-
zan resident in Australia, knows all about
water-buffaloes (B. 24/12/’5B). His
family in Borneo grow rice and, like
all the other farmers, work cows only
because their sex is intelligent and
amenable, can plough a rice - field
thoroughly while guided by a very small
boy, is wise in stepping over irrigation-
ditches and verges, and does not greedily
snatch mouthfuls of young padi. All
bulls go to the butchers; a plough-
trained cow is worth £47 Australian. The
accompanying insects are not midges but
gadflies, which settle at dusk on the beast
and attack any ticks. The buffalo-birds
go for the gadflies.

“Wigwag”: Two Murray River punt-
men stand-out in my memory. The first,
at Lyrup, almost invariably changed the
belt-drive with his bare hands without
stopping the engine, deftly guiding it
onto the other pulley to reverse the punt.
He also baited his fishing-lines with bare
hands, which only became remarkable
when you saw that his favorite bait was
live centipedes, which he kept writhing
around the bottom of half a kero.-tin.
The other chap operated on the stretch
between Lakes Alexandria and Albert.
Approved passengers krfew exactly where
to pull-up so that the driver’s window
was opposite the small hole cut in the
galvanised-iron protecting the engine.
Out of this hole would appear a massive
hand proffering a glass cup of dark port.
The favored few knew it as the “port-
hole.” The perils of a crossing on this
punt when a really good Murray Valley
“Another Wet Weekend!"
"... and besides , it’s closed season on ducks!”
wind was blowing were—and still are —•
considerable. The only difference of
opinion I ever had with this second punt-
man was when I once referred to the
avocets flying over the water. ’’Aversets,”
he cried, smiting a mighty thigh with
glee, “them ain’t aversets, that’s the
’aversack bird.”

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Led by 6ft. 2in.
patrol-officer D. B. Moorhouse, a New
Guinea administrative patrol - lately
renewed contact with the exceptionally
tall nomadic peoples of the Passismanua
and' Gimi divisions of New Britain.
Moorhouse found himself frequently
dwarfed by these people, who have
powerful chests and almost abnormally
long legs and arms. Cordial relations
were established, and a sing-sing was held
at which four pigs, rice and meat were
given by the patrol, and dancing lasted
all night.

“Fairf”: Those air-pageants in the
’thirties (B. 10/12/’5B) were not confined
to Mascot. During one at Hargrave
Park (N.S.W.) an amplified voice shouted
in alarm: “Stop that man, constable!
Stop him before he gets to that plane.”
A policeman dashed out of the crowd
and sprinted across the field in pursuit
of an untidy - looking civilian tacking
drunkenly, but with surprising speed,
towards a stationary plane. The drunk
fell into the cockpit. Two seconds later,
to the horror of the crowd, the plane
zig-zagged crazily and took-off. For
about five minutes the crowd watched in
horror-stricken silence as the plane per-
formed exactly as it could be expected
to with a drunk at the controls ; then
the ripples of relieved laughter replacing
the gasps, told that the mob had caught-on.

“Sevenelms”: If I were guilty, as
“H.C.8.” (B. 24/12 / '5B) implies, of
stating that Australian hardwoods are
weakened by air-drying, I would cheer-
fully accept the suggested penance of
felling a dead ironbark with a blunt axe.
But a timberman knows that air-drying,
complemented by collapsed cells, does
not adversely affect wood-strength, and
that if two similar pieces of wood are,
after seasoning, reduced to a common
size the air-dried one will exceed the kiln-
dried one in stress-performance. “H.C.8.”
derisively invites us to witness collapse
in structural bridge-timbers, but we do
not observe collapse or cell-distortion in
air-dried wood, because that calls for a
microscope. I did not “dismiss airily 70
years of seasoning know-how by the
Sydney Technical College,” because
there just wasn’t any know-how until the
C.5.1.R.0., in 1928, discovered cell-
collapse under its microscope, and there-
after Australia led the world in timber-
seasoning.

Sketches slender canes. They clamber

Where a fantail may alight
From his twisting, turning flight.

Up the creek’s stairway of boulders,
Log and living willynilly ■
Bear her records on their shoulders
Of the bird’s flight through the air
Interpreted in tendrils there.

Time Means Tucker
By H. P. (“DUKE”) TRITTON
Illustrations chiefly from contemporary issues of The Bulletin.
Both of them 19-year-olds, the writer and his mate Dutchy have set out from
Sydney in 1905 on a breezily adventurous wander about the N.S.W. outback,
learning to become shearers, doing fencing contracts .and having a go at gold-
digging, singing and taking the hat round in the towns, boxing in show booths,
meeting picturesque characters, and generally getting to know the bush and bush
folk, and taking life as they find it. They have gone by boat to Newcastle, headed
west from there, jumped the rattler to Narrabri, and, characteristically, have
done their share with other volunteer firefighters in saving that town from being
burnt down. After shearing at Charlton and a bit of fighting in George Ruenalf’s
boxing-show, they have headed further west through flood-rains, and have just
completed a tough fencing-contract in rough country along the boundary between
Gumin and Goorianawa stations.
WE knew we could
always get a few quid
without much.trouble,
so we went to Coon-
amble, and met George
Ruen a 1 f again. He was
pleased to see us. We joined-
up with him, and went with
him to Gulargambone, Gil-
gandra, Dubbo, Wellington,
Gulgong and Mudgee, boxing
and singing.
At Mudgee we gave the
boxing-game away. George
was paying us two-quid a week,
with tucker and transport.
Boxing with the members of
the show was easy, but on
the way down from Coonamble
we had met some of the local
lads, who had been tough.
And some of these round-
armers had plenty of sting.
It was impossible to dodge
all' of them, and when
we met five or six in the one
day it was a bit strenuous.
\\7e got the gold-fever. Once
bitten by the gold-bug
there is no cure, and after 50
years I am still subject to
periodical attacks. The only
relief I can get is to make for
the goldfields, shift a few
hundred tons of earth, get a
couple of ’weights, and come
back cured. But the germ is
still in my blood, and 1 don’t
want to be cured.
We met an old chap, Tom
Henqesy, who was willing to
give his experience in return
for our strength. We went out
to Havilah, once the property
of Nicholas Bayley, but then
(and still) occupied by the
Hunter White family. Nicholas
Bayley had taken Havilah in
1835—17 years before gold was
“officially discovered” in
N.S.W. He must have known
something of gold, as Havilah
is mentioned in the Bible as
“The home *of gold,” or “A
place where there is gold.”
There are several good leads
on Havilah—Mount Knowles,
Bara Creek, Raggedy Gully,
Cross Roads, Budgee and
Pipeclay Creek. All these runs
were rich in the yellow metal,
but Bayley would not allow
these to be worked till 1871,
when Gulgong field was dis-
covered and the rush was so
great that he was forced to let
the diggers on his land.
Bayley was one of the first
men to grow fine wool in Aus-
tralia. By systematic crossing
he built-up the best flock, at
the time,- in the country. The
White family have carried on
in the same tradition, with the
addition of cattle and horses.
Nicholas Bayley was buried, at
his own request, on a hill over-
looking most of Havilah (said
to be buried standing upright).
On his way out from Eng-
land Bayley’s ship called in at
St. Helena, and he cut several
slips from the willows at
Napoleon’s grave. All survived
the voyage, and were planted
on Havilah, where they thrived,
and spread up and down
Lawson’s Creek and the Cud-
gegong River. I have heard
that these willows were the
first to be grown in N.S.W.,
but do not know if it is true.
Tom Hennesy was well
versed in the art of chasing
the nimble “ ’weight.” Under his
tuition we soon became experts
with a gold-dish, and learned
how to sink a straight “hole,”
and arch-out the “drive.” In
a week we learned the jargon
of the goldfields, and spoke
wisely of holes, drives, bottoms,
gutters, mullock, colors, specks,
slugs and nuggets.
We found we were “diggers,”
not miners, mining being the
work of the “reefers” ; and
we never sank shafts, but “put
down holes.” We never spoke
of rock, but always stone ; 'and
cradles, long-Toms, banjos,
puddlers, sluice-boxes, races,
California- and spear-pumps
all came into our everyday
speech.
A bout 20 men were on the
lead, mostly old chaps
who would be pensioners to-
day. They were friendly, but
very secretive when gold was
mentioned. It wasn’t good
manners to ask too closely if
a digger was on gold. The
nearest approach was to say
casually, “Getting a bit?” And
the reply was almost invariably,
“Oh, yes, a few colors.” But
some were so obvious that
they might just as well have
advertised when they were on
gold.
We usually washed our
“prospects” at the same place,
where* there was a little beach
in the creek, and would have
a smoke and yarn with any of
the diggers who happened to
be there. It was the general
meeting-place; we swapped
opinions, cursed the Govern-
ment and our luck, and went
back to work feeling much
better. So when we would
see one of the old chaps sneak-
ing furtively with a sugar-bag
of washdirt on his shoulder
and a dish under his arm,
making for a place further
down the creek, we knew he
was “on a bit of gold.”
Most of the old diggers were
fiercely independent, though
many of them had sons or
daughters with whom they
could have lived in comfort,
but they preferred to scratch a
somewhat precarious living out
of the ground. One of the
nicest of them was Jim Hill.
About 70 years old, a little
over sft. tall, gentle in his
ways, and liked by all, he had
his claim in shallow ground,
not deep enough to drive, so
it had to be stripped.
One day, seeing him feebly
scratching with his pick, I
offered to strip a bit of
ground for him. His wrath
rocked me to the toes. He
cursed me up and down, and
wanted to know “What the
bloody hell I thought he was?
Did I think he was a bloody
cripple? What right had a
bloody kid to tell him what to
do?”
Under the glare of his
blazing eyes I retreated in dis-
order, much to the joy of
Dutchy. He said I ran, but I
was too shocked to know.

JOHN FAIRFAX EXPANSION
'T'he John Fairfax group has
consolidated its publish-
ing position fairly rapidly since
the public flotation which
followed the acquisition of
control of Associated News-
papers, Ltd. Though circula-
tion of most of its publications
has been affected by the advent
of TV (in which it has an off-
setting financial interest), jiot
more so than its opposition ;
and advertising revenue has
increased appreciably. A juicy
melon-cutting by Australian
Newsprint Mills, Ltd., has
brought a wad of cash and free
shares since the close of
accounts, the cash arriving just
in time to help-out in the
financing of the purchase of the
majority of the ordinary shares
in Truth and Sportsman, Ltd.,
from Ezra Norton and his
associates (B. 31/12/”58).
Though loudly proclaiming in
the market-place that it has not
acquired control, of the Norton
press, but merely provided the
finance for a company called
O’Connell Pty., Ltd., so to do,
the Fairfax group obviously
has entered into the deal for
the purpose of protecting its
own newspaper interests and
to stop the evening “Mirror”
and associated . publications
from falling into the hands of
strong Sydney or Melbourne
opposition. What this financial
operation has set the “Herald”
back for isn’t at all clear at
the moment, but rumor says at
least £750,000. Truth and
Sportsman, Ltd., has been a
well-run and profitable organi-
sation, though over the last
two years it has been feeling
the keener competion from the
“Herald”-acquired “Sun.”
Before the Norton deal, in
the year to June 30 last John
Fairfax, Ltd., and its chief
subsidiaries, with the help of
a full year’s revenue from
increased prices (5d., against
4d. previously) for its daily
papers and higher advertising
charges, showed a trading
profit and investment income
of £1,373,955 (up £203,082),
in spite of a £750,000 increase
in newsprint costs. Deprecia-
tion provision was £12,036
higher at £242,723, directors’
fees £lO,OOO, and £lOO,OOO was
set aside (a new item) for news-
print price-fluctuations. Pro-
vision for tax was £10,474
higher at £311,370. Allowing
“Oo’ll I say is callin' ?”
for outside interests, net profit
was up £81,363 at £606,236:

The result, which from the
nature of the taxation allow-
ance seems to have had a con-
siderable help from dividends
from Australian Newsprint
Mills (25 p.c. again), was equal
to 15.1 p.c. on capital, com-
pared with 13.1 p.c. in the pre-
ceding year. (The £lOO,OOO
written-off stocks was equal to
another 2.5 p.c. on capital.
Since the close of accounts
newsprint prices have dropped,
but in the long-run this should
be of benefit to the company,
even though it may pre-
sent temporary accounting
problems. It is not as though
the reduction is likely to be
passed on to the customer.)
Shareholders in John Fair-
fax were pleasantly surprised
with a lift in the div. from
74 p.c. to 94 p.c.
Volume of advertising in the
four newspapers increased 114
p.c. last year, and revenue
would have been greater in
proportion. Volume of ads. in
each, of the four magazines
also increased.
All publications turned-in a
profit, except “Woman’s Day.”
This magazine showed an in-
crease from 420,000 a week to
440,000 in circulation, and it
carried 9 p.c. more advertising.
John Fairfax, Ltd., controls John
Fairfax and Sons, Ltd., and the ord.
capital of Associated Newspapers,
Ltd. Through one or . other of
these subsidiaries it owns over a
third of the shares in prosperous
Australian Newsprint Mills, Ltd.,
51 p.c. of the shares in Amal-
gamated Television Services Pty.,
Ltd., and 14 p.c. of Broadcasting
Station 2GB Pty., Ltd.
Publications are the “Sydney
Morning Herald” (daily), “The
Sun” (afternoon daily), “The Sun-
Herald” (Sunday), “The Australian
Financial Review” (weekly),
“Woman's Day” (weekly), “Pix”
(weekly), “People” (fortnightly),
“Radio, Television and Hobbies”
(monthly).
The precise financial relationship
between John Fairfax, Ltd., and
Truth and Sportsman, Ltd., has not
yet been clarified.
When a final call of £50,000
is paid-up on the 51 p.c. hold-
ing in Amalgamated Television
Services the cost of this invest-
ment will have been
It has not yet paid a dividend,
but is operating at a profit.
The holding is shown among
investments in the consolidated
accounts.
The reconstruction of Aus-
tralian Newsprint Mills, Ltd.,
amounted to a three-for-one
bonus ord. issue and a capital-
return of 15s. per £JL ord.
share. After the bonus the
Fairfax group will hold
2,600,000 £1 shares in the
reconstructed co., having
received back £487,500 in cash
as well/ Paid capital of the
newsprint holding-co. will be
£8,384,764 in 7,384,764 £1 ords.
and a million £1 prefs. carry-
ing 7 p.c. (raised from 5 p.c.).
After completion _ of the
reconstruction the par-value of
the Fairfax holding will be
nearly £24 million greater than
the “net effective cost of the
investment” as shown in the
books. The Fairfax board,
with justification, believes the
market-value to be even
greater.
One of the group’s problems
is to keep all its plant, includ-
ing the rotogravure presses,
profitably occupied. Another
snag is the clash of news-
paper personalities in Sydney
(now reduced by the retirement
of Norton), not always based
on economic commonsense.
This is mostly noticeable in the
mortal struggle between
Packer’s “Women’s Weekly”
and the Fairfax “Woman’s
Day,” both sold for ninepence,
whereas the sd. charged for
the dailies would indicate that
a shilling would be nearer a
fair price, and would probably
pull “Woman’s Day” out of the
red.
Because of its classified
advertising, its more careful
record of events (including s.-p.
information), and its fairly
comprehensive news - cover
“The Sydney Morning Herald”
occupies a strong position in
the State. Under the arrange-
ment with Norton the position
of “The Sun” should now be
stronger also.
Flotation of John Fairfax,
Ltd., as a public co. in April,
1956, followed a few months


after transfer of both “Herald”
and “Sun” publications to
Broadway. The old “Herald”
building was sold for
£1,500,000 and “The Sun”
building for £1,100,000. The
A.M.P. financed the new
Broadway building to the
extent of £2,500,000, and a
rental is payable to the A.M.P.
At June 30 last the Fairfax
equity in freehold properties
(including the Rosebery maga-
zine-centre) was £1,639,847 ;
sales of three surplus properties
during the year were re-
sponsible for a net reduction
of £39,333.
Liabilities, secured and un-
secured, appear high in relation
to shareholders’ disclosed
funds, especially in view of the
fact that the group is living in
partly rented premises:

sideration.

John Fairfax £1 ords., of

print Mills melon-cutting and
the Norton deal in the wind

dend, which seems to be indi-
cated this term.
Aluminium
[From “Old Opencut”]
■Recent developments in the
world of aluminium are
of vital interest to Australia.
Tasmanian Premier Reece’s
offer to find £l| million if
private industry will assist with
the Bell Bay plant-expansion
to 26,000 tons output yearly
brought out a three-man in-
vestigating mission from the
British Aluminium Co.
Since this company has a
sizeable team of technologists
and finance-wallahs already at
work up north, the mission
looks like a left-hand pat at
Bell Bay while the right
hand moulds Commonwealth
Aluminium into shape.
The move could, of course,
be designed to provide an out-
let for Weipa bauxite pending
the maturity of the long-range
plans and, perhaps, thus dis-
courage overseas competition
in this particular field.
Events may have developed
to the satisfaction of all con-
cerned but for recent dramatic
happenings. Reynolds Metal
Corporation, of the U.S.A.,
a comparative newcomer in
aluminium production but a
powerful force in the world of
metals generally, working
through its British subsidiary
and agent, British Tube Invest-
ments, is attempting to take-
over British Aluminium.
The B.A. board is fighting
hard in opposition.
The Reynolds corporation is
very interested in our bauxite
deposits and has prospecting-*
teams working up north at
present.
If the take-over eventuates
the Weipa position could be
complicated. The B.A. com-
pany and Consolidated Zinc
are joint partners in Australia’s
Commonwealth Aluminium
Corporation.
The Reynold’s group does
not usually suffer partnerships.
They own in their own right
and on their terms or there is
no deal.
Aluminium is quoted at £lBO
a ton on the London market,
a drop of £l7 over the past
year.
Bell Bay cannot compete with
these basic figures on present
tonnage. It might be able to
pay bank interest on a yearly
output of *26,000 tons, a total
readily absorbable on the
Australasian markets.
British Aluminium
T ord Portal, chairman of
British Aluminium, in a
letter to shareholders dated
December 5, 1958, stated that
his company had feared the
possibility of an attempted
takeover when the B.A.
expansion programme had
reached its most interesting
stage. Consequently, an
arrangement had been made
with the Aluminium Company
of America (Alcoa) to issue
£4£ million of capital at 60s.

Faith in the
Future
On my travels abroad I made a point of
searching, through Australian eyes, for whatever
would seem of special significance to our
country’s future.
In the United States, I believe, is a development
that is going to be of profound importance to
ourselves and to the world: the advances being
made in the conversion of salt and brackish
water into fresh.
This is what President Eisenhower was
referring to when, addressing the General Assembly
of the United Nations on the Middle East question
in August, he said that man’s ancient problem of
water was on the threshold of solution.
The conversion process has been taken well
past the laboratory stage. It is now only a question
of getting it down to practical cost.
A small automatic purifying still for homes
and farms is about to go into commercial
manufacture in New York State. Using a small
amount of electricity for steam-condensation, it
can produce five hundred gallons of pure
water a day.
The U.S. Government is to build on St.
Thomas, one of the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean,
the largest sea-water conversion plant in the Western
Hemisphere—to expand commerce, industry, and
agriculture, and to provide for a rising tourist trade.
These are pointers in a much more general
programme. Put the effects of it against the
background fact that more than one-third of the
earth’s surface is unfit now for cultivation because
of the lack of water. Relate it to solution of the
question of'how the world is going to sustain its
rapidly increasing population. That is the measure
of its meaning for mankind.
Authorities say it may be some time before
the process will be applicable to vast areas. But
their faith in its certainty is supported by the
knowledge that atomic energy will be giving
immense power to tractive channelling in the
years ahead.
Here is the exciting prospect: We are within
touch of the time when now-parched areas of this
world will be made to bloom.

preserved control of the com-
pany to its British proprietors
and management and did not
take away from shareholders
Ihe now-developing advantages
of the big B.A. expansion
programme.
This expansion was explained
by Lord Portal as follows:
(1) The board has formed a com-
pany, Canadian British Aluminium
Co., Ltd. (C.8.A.), to establish
ingot-production at Baie Comeau in
the Province of Quebec. With
C.B.A. producing at the rate ot

ing-capacity at the present time is
100,000 tons.
(2) In Australasia, in association
with the Commonwealth Govern-
ment and through New Guinea
Resources Prospecting Company
(N.G.R.P.), B.A. has been exploring
hydroelectric development in Papua
and bauxite deposits in the Northerh
Territory of Australia. Recently, in
Association with the Consolidated
Zinc Corporation (C.Z.C.), further
exploration of bauxite and coal
deposits has been carried out.
Commonwealth Aluminium Cor-
poration Pty., Ltd. (Comalco), a
company owned as to 50 p.c. by
B.A. and 50 p.c. by C.Z.C.,
has been formed . with the object
of acquiring the Commonwealth
Government’s interest in N.G.R.P.
and merging all these resources.
Exploration-work to date has been
very satisfactory; some of the
largest deposits of commercial-
grade bauxite in the world have
been proved and the possibilities of
economic power-development are
promising.
(3) In West Africa, B.A. has
taken part in the- establishment of
FRIA, Compagnie Internationale
pour la- Production de I’Alumine,
an internationally owned alumina-
producing company, whose product
will be shared between its stock-
holders in proportion to their stake
in it.
(4) As a founder-member of
various international study and
exploration companies, particularly
in West Africa, B.A. has the oppor-
tunity of participating in any
production-companies which may
develop from these investigations.
Lord Portal told share-
holders that the Reynolds
group, through Tube Invest-
ments, had quietly bought
nearly a million British
Aluminium shares on the
market before revealing their
identity or purpose.
Lord Portal, in advising
against the Reynolds/Tube
takeover offer, said that these
people have realised for some
time “that the gap between
your company’s present earn-
ing-capacity and that which it
will have when its potential
earnings . have materialised
might enable them to acquire
a powerful empire for the
sake of a small kingdom.”
He therefore advocated
the partnership with Alcoa,
which would maintain British
Aluminium’s present control
and -identity.
Big Noises Abroad
IZeith Ballantyne, the Mel-
bourne dairy - products
exporter who was the sub-
ject of a Bulletin sketch
when he set-out with the
floating trade-mission in the
ship Delos, has returned con-
vinced that these business
circuses have everything to
recommend them against visits
by individual businessmen
carrying their own private
attache-cases ; and Premier
Bolte is setting-out for another
Sell Victoria publicity cam-
paign, this time in America and
Europe.
The Delos received spec-
tacular publicity ; special
supplements on Australian
trade were published by many
newspapers when the Delos.
was in port, so there was no
reason why interested Asians
could not know the Australian
mission was in town.
The Australians found an
excellent market for Australian
dairy-produce, from Hong
Kong to Singapore, especially
Malaya, waiting to be ex-
ploited ; but there was no
hope for the industry in Japan
or Red China, although China
had given the mission orders
for steel, iron and non-ferrous
metals, and probably offered a
big market for them.
A substantial contributor to
the mission’s success was the
“Stop Worrying, Leo. We're quite safe as long as they
stay in their cars."
Department of Trade, which
gets rather less than its due
in return publicity in Australia
since so much of its promo-
tion is done abroad, and, with
the department’s blessing,
there will be more trade-
mission ships to the Far
East.
On his second Sell Victoria
tour, the Premier will be
accompanied by his wife, Sir
John Jungwirth (who is per-
manent head of the Premier’s
Department), and Cr. Maurice
Nathan, chairman of the Vic-
toria Promotion Committee ;
and the selling-season will run
for more than two months,
covering parts of the U.S..
Canada, Britain, • Germany,
France and Italy.
It is significant the longest
stop will be in London, where
they will remain three weeks ;
despite all the ballyhoo, it is
still Britain who is investing
more money in Australia than
any other country.
Bolte has hopes of getting
the Volkswagen and Mercedes
works to expand their manu-
facturing to Victoria. His new
adventure overseas has been
received in Victoria with f more
enthusiasm than indifference,
and the Melbourne press
remarks complacently that the
Sell Victoria missions now are
being imitated by the other
States. Still, if they are
imitated overmuch, a clash in
an overseas city is likely,
followed by national embar-
rassment.
New Zealand Hotels
[From "D."]
TVTew Zealand hotels? Within
the last few weeks I put
in 10 of the pleasantest days I
have spent in a hotel anywhere
at the Grand, Auckland.
The moment I entered my
small bedroom I knew this was
a hotel to suit an Australian
taste: there was a light-switch
at the door for the centre light,
a light over the looking-glass,
a light over the bed and a
switch over the bed for the
centre light.
The bed had more clothing
than you could want reason-
ably, including a real eider-
down-; the room-service was
friendly, prompt and unde-
manding ; the drink-waiters
never hovered near you, unless
you wanted them ; the staff was
friendly; the menu struck a
nice balance between sophisti-
cation and home-cooking, and
was so generous an Englishman
asked, “Which of these may
I have?” and the smiling
waitress said, “Have them all,
sir!”
There was a number of
sitting-rooms, a private bar
with the right prices and a
cloakroom with none. I didn’t
have a private bathroom, with
no sense of being put upon
at all, and the one across the
passage had a clean, comfort-
able friendliness that didn’t
make me feel too common in
the nude, as American bath-
rooms can.

SUNDRY
SHOWS
LONDON STAGE, 1958
[From Herbert Holman, London]
r T''HE London theatre in 1958
was interesting if scarcely
outstanding. It was a year
marked by professional com-
petence rather than individual
distinction, whether of author
or actor. Yet the mood,
character and style of play-
production was not static but
astonishingly virile, suggesting
that the producer is still the
chief arbiter and that he is
restlessly searching for plays
which give him scope for im-
provisation.
Although there is no dearth
of playwrights, established or
otherwise, the authors’ domi-
nation of the theatre is long-
past history. It was nothing
out of the ordinary for Pinero,
Shaw, Barry, Galsworthy,
Maugham, Lonsdale and
Coward to have two or more
plays running concurrently, and
their names, strengthened by
fashionable actors, were a box-
office attraction. Last year, the
three - authors whose names
were the biggest draw were
Aristophanes, Shakspeare and
O'Neill ; the living lonesco
and Tennessee Williams fol-
lowed some way behind.
It is significant that three
established playwrights, each
of more than 20 years’ stand-
ing, suffered failures. In “Beth”
Emlyn Williams wrote a poor
play which he produced him-
self in the manner of the
’thirties ; the result was pain-
ful. Terence Rattigan’s style
(“Variation on a Theme”)
seemed listless. And T. S.
Eliot’s “The Elder Statesman”
(thin but no thinner than “The
Cocktail Party” or its suc-
cessors) simply had no appeal
to the younger playgoers.
The truth is that, since John
Osborne infected the theatre
with his astringent bite, the
average age of audiences has
become younger, and these
new playgoers want innovation,
excitement and high intensity.
This is particularly evident at
that shrine of obscurantism
the Royal Court Theatre, where
esoteric squalor, long-haired
impressionism and rebellion
against convention (Osborne’s
influence still) threaten to be-
come a self-conscious cult.
Another challenge to the
legitimate stage is the zest and
high quality of the musicals,
to which “My Fair Lady” gave
such an impact last May.
Highlights
The best play of the year
was “Five Finger Exercise,” by
a young man, Peter Shaffer,
who graduated to the live
theatre from television. In
this finely-wrought drama, the
“Just SIT, mug—that act's for fillet!"
producer, John Gielgud, has
had no need to resort to tricks.
Here the balance is as it should
be: the author dominates
throughout, producer and
actors interpreting his creation.
Roland Culver gives a per-
formance of distinction as the
misunderstanding Philistine
who turns out to be no less
sensitive (and misunderstood)
than his patronising wife and
son.
Genuine sympathy goes to
N. C. Hunter for the qualified
success of “Touch of the Sun.”
This author, having made a
fortune out of neo-Chekovian
vehicles for theatrical Knights
and Dames, set out to write
an individual play. He suc-
ceeded, brilliantly, especially
in conveying mood and atmo-
sphere by dialogue alone. It
is sincerely to be hoped that
the limited interest shown by
the public will not cause him,
in despair, to revert to the stuff
of women’s magazines.
“Touch it Light,” an endear-
ing and too-true comedy about
civilians ill-at-ease in uniform
might have become a “Seagulls
Over Sorrento” if, after a good
start, it had been able to find
another home. (Because of the
musicals and long-runners the
shortage of theatres for new
plays is really serious; this
is disheartening and unhealthy
for the future of the theatre.)
The failure of the year was
the project, sponsored by some
of the most influential
managers in the profession, to
form a “club” theatre (the New
Watergate) with a wide mem-
bership so that, inter alia,
banned plays could be pre-
sented. There were three such,
“A View from the Bridge,”
“Tea and Sympathy” and “Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof.” After a
good production of the first,
something went wrong and the
venture petered out dismally.
But the Arts Theatre, with its
less-ambitious offerings, club-
room and splendid, reasonably-
priced restaurant, survives. The
explanation would seem to be
that the cosyness of intimacy
is something that cannot be
inflated.
The standard of corporate
acting remains high. Indi-
vidual performances by Joan
Greenwood, Michael Red-
grave, Charles Laughton, Joan
Plowright and Paul Rogers
were all memorable. In Ronald
Lewis the Old Vic has an
actor of potential greatness.
But the younger talent seems
to be the monopoly of song-
and-dance; Julie Andrews
(“My Fair Lady”), James
Kenney (“Expresso Bongo”),
Daniel Massey (“Living for
Pleasure”) and Elizabeth Seal
(“Irma la Douce”) are four
youngsters of exceptional
artistry, versatility and com-
mand.
Late Starter
Peter Finch has returned to
the stage, after six years, in
“Two for the Seesaw” (Hay-
market Theatre), an aptly-
titled drama by William Gibson
about an irregular union in
New York City. Jerry Ryan,
a Nebraskan attorney emo-
tionally shaken by estrange-
ment from Tess, his wife,
takes-up on the rebound Gittel
Mosca, a Polish dancer from
the Bronx. This “lonely
hearts” association is doomed
from the beginning, for he is
well-bred while she is a gutter-
child of low intelligence and
both are conscious of the
difference. The relationship
alternates between the ex-
tremes of passionate affection
and violent brawling, with,
however, an interlude of
idyllic tenderness when the girl
is ill (from a chronic ulcer,
penalty for her irregular life).
When, after eight months of
seesawing, he is on the point
of giving up his apartment to
join her, she walks-out on him.
Needing complete surrender,
she realises that, though now
divorced, he is unable to dis-
miss Tess from his thoughts.
To pronounce this compel-
ling play as “good theatre”
would be as inadequate as
saying that it is a duologue.
Only two characters are seen,
but the complex, torn fabric
of their lives and the people
who have marred them are real
and manifest. Moreover, the
writing and production are so
skilful that the composite set
and the artifices employed to
avoid monotony are unnoticed#
What could easily have been
a cheap and squalid play about
a cheap and squalid situation
is redeemed by the essential
underlying truth to Gittel of
the incident (“It’s the first
affair I’ve come out of with
more than I went in”) and by
such virtuoso acting as we have
not seen since Elizabeth
Bergner played Gemma Jones
(a similar part) in “Escape Me
Never.” Gerry Jedd (Gittel)
is an American who has won
an award, but who has never
appeared on Broadway. She
palpably overacts, thereby fail-
ing to honor some of the

FROM LEADING STOCK & STATION AGENTS
"I only use the push-button seat-ejector when customers
get aggressively drunk.”
character-building in the dia-
logue, but with such inflamed
sincerity and verisimilitude that
all hearts are wrung and few
eyes are dry. The sympathy
she attracts, both in the writing
and in the playing, leaves little
room for her lover, and it is
only in the last few minutes
that the pointer swings his way.
In dramatic values, this
denies equality of status for
the male part, making it diffi-
cult and unrewarding—a role
that a popular star, jealous of
his pre-eminence, would reject
at sight. Peter Finch, though
tremendously virile, unselfishly
avoids giving the part more
than it contains and must per-,
force take second place.
Cinerama Comes to Mel-
bourne
To the accompaniment of
stereophonic music which
sounded like a prolonged
screech from the American
eagle, Cinerama has come to
Melbourne Plaza at a cost to
the proprietors of £75,000 and
several weeks’ previous absten-
tion from their business of
entertaining the public.
The public can be assured
that they will be not only enter-
tained but come away com-
pletely blithered. You take
your seat in the darkened
theatre, a couple of hundred
square - yards of curtain
majestically unfold, and you
find yourself suddenly sitting
not on the floor of the Plaza
Theatre but on the deck of
some vehicle or other which is
rushing at breakneck speed into
the Allegheny Mountains,
plunging headlong into the
Grand Canyon, or belting feet-
first into the tall buildings of
Salt Lake City. Sometimes a
puff of wind flings the Plaza
Theatre onto its beam-ends and,
reeling sideways, you grab your
chair-arms.
It is no use telling yourself
you are in the grip of an
optical illusion any more than
it is any use telling a colorblind
person that he is living in a
colored world and not a grey
world. You shut your eyes to
recover your composure and
reopen them to find that the
Plaza has turned itself into a
gondola careering straight for
the Square of St. Marks,
Venice, and not merely a seg-
ment of it but the whole darned
lot, just as if you were looking
at a bad reproduction of a
picture of it by Canaletto.
At the interval you repair to
soothe your nerves to the
nearest milkbar and you return
prepared for the worst to find
that the theatre has been turned
by the magic of Cinerama into
a helicopter which is making a
more leisurely progress across
the American continent from
New York to San Francisco.
Looking at U.S. in this way is
as surprisingly devoid of human
interest and emotion as look-
ing at a map, and you have
time to reflect that Cinerama
has missed the bus this time.
The bird’s-eye view is as alien
to man’s experience and nature
as the worm’s-eye view.
Meeting a friend in the street
gives you one sort of feeling,
and meeting an enemy gives
you another, but looking down
on a million such meetings
from an altitude of a
thousand feet gives you no
emotion whatsoever.
There are other queer aspects
of Cinerama. When a choir
sings a cantata in a cathedral
you get the impression that it
is the audience that is singing.
When the whole of La Scala
and “Aida” is presented in
one vast panorama the whole
looks smaller than the part,
and Pharoah and the priests
and the army and Rhadames
look like a lot of ineffectual
puppets.
It remains to be seen what
Cinerama will do with a simple
domestic situation like a
dialogue between a wife and
husband when the husband
has been found to have taken
the typiste to the pictures when
he was supposed to be working
late at the office. There isn't
an audience in the world which
isn’t more interested in that sort
of situation than in stereo-
phonic sound or stereoscopic
vision.
One wonders how long the
thrill one gets at finding one-
self rushing along on a space-
ship will last. The first moving
picture the present writer ever
saw was at Adelaide Town
Hall. He was sitting in the
front row, and a wave on the
point of breaking came rushing
at him. He ducked, and so
did almost everybody in the
theatre, including the peanut-
sellers. Nobody ducks now
at a breaking wave in a moving-
picture theatre. The human
perceptual apparatus has an
almost infinite capacity of
adaptation. If it hadn’t we
would still be jellyfish “seeing”
our way by contact.

Stage and Music
Royal Ballet
The Royal Ballet season at
Her Majesty’s, Melbourne,
finished at a run, helped
thereto by the extraordinary
eloquence of the feet of Robert
Helpmann. “The Rake’s Pro-
gress,” by Gavin Gordon after
Hogarth, was his contribution.
Costumes and scenery were by
Rex Whistler, also after
Hogarth. The “after Hogarth”
is important. Although
Hogarth’s greatness isn’t con-
tained in his illustrations but
in his “Shrimp Girl” and a
self-portrait, sufficient of his
genius is in his moral essays
to affect Gordon’s choreo-
graphy, Whistler’s settings and


Helpmann’s dancing, which
was of the vividest description.
So was Anne Heaton's
portrayal of The Betrayed
Girl.

Lithuanians in Melbourne
The Victorian Artists’
Society closed its year with a
show of oils, lithos and sculp-
ture by Lithuanian artists.
Jurgis Bistrickas gets the
character of flowers in an oil,
and in the medium of sculp-
ture Vincas Jomantas provides
a design for a TV-aerial which,
being made of copper, might
work. Paul Cleveland’s “The
Red Table” is rich in color.
One of the most dolorous heads
of Christ seen for a long time
is provided in copper by
Teisutis Zikaras, and there is
another in oils by Jurgis Mik-
sevicius. Adolfas Vaicaitis has
a colored litho landscape which
has points, and his “On the
Way” is a good sketch.

Films
“South Pacific”
Rodgers’s melodious tunes
and Hammerstein’s fluent, witty
lyrics, plus some magnificent
photography in the new Todd-
AO process and a sparkling
performance by Mitzi Gaynor
combine to make this one of
the best musicals yet. The
South Sea setting alone is
worth inspection. While the
musical score is occasionally
boosted too much, and the
director sometimes goes for
over-spectacular effects by
flooding the scenes with
changing colors, these defects
cannot reduce the overall
effect of tip-top entertainment.
Going beyond the limits of
Cinema Scope and not reach-
ing to the boundaries of
Cinerama with its enormous
three-section screen, Todd-AO
succeeds admirably in achiev-
ing perfect clarity and depth
on an “enchanted island.” The
Michener story holds together
well ; there is outstanding
character-work by Juanita
Hall, as the shrewd trader,
“Bloody” Mary, with her one-
track mind bent on getting her
daughter married-off to a
white man ; and Rossano
Brazzi is smooth and relaxed
as the French planter who
falls in love with the American
nurse.
Mitzi Gaynor’s vivacity is
backed-up by easy and accurate
singing. The dubbing-in of the
baritone voices for Brazzi and
John Kerr (whose Lieut. Joe
Cable is barely adequate) is
so skilful that it is practically
impossible to detect the device.
One of the features of the
film is the excellent weight and
balance of the choruses by
the Navy men, especially in
the “Dame’’ song. The many
comedy touches are deft and
sure.

and a particular one for Jews.
Kaye does no clowning. He
is the meek, serene refugee,
determined to survive, so that
after the war he may settle
down somewhere until he is
hunted once again by some
totalitarian, Jew-hating invader.
It is a performance of deep
human sympathy, and he makes
the resourceful Jacobowsky a
very lovable character.
There is restrained and
subtle comedy in the many
episodes between the time the
ill-assorted pair leave Paris in
the old Rolls-Royce, until they
embark on the submarine that
is to take them to England.
Always it is the colonel who
makes a big show of bringing
his military genius to the
solution of their many
problems, and always it is the
quick wit of the self-effacing
Jew which saves the situation.
Curt Jurgens gives a good
account of the colonel, blown-
up with his own tremendous
ego, and well earning the
caustic remark from his corn-
panion, “You have one of the
finest minds of the twelfth
century!’’ Nicole Maurey
gives a charming portrait of
the Colonel’s mistress who
gradually comes to see and
appreciate the real quality of
the modest Jacobowsky.

“The Remarkable Mr.
Pennypacker”
The hero of this comedy has
sired 17 children, eight by one
wife and nine by another. The
wealthy vice-president of a big
meat-packing concern, he has
managed to keep each wife
and family unaware of the
other’s existence by keeping
’em cities-apart, a factory in
each place being his excuse for
the extended trips. When he
is summoned home to give his
blessing to the betrothal of his
eldest daughter, his eldest son
from the other family follows
with an important message and
the gaff is blown.
This doesn’t perturb the
redoubtable Pa. With supreme
self-confidence he argues his
philosophy, maintaining that
for 20 years he has kept two
women happy, whereas a
monogamist can manage only
half that, etc. It is all such
light-hearted nonsense that it
would be cavilling to object to
the too-glib resolving of the
problems.
Clifton Webb, serene and
debonair, makes the character
so likeable that he almost
succeeds in raising bigamy to a
high virtue. Dorothy Maguire
is well cast as the surviving
wife who cops the matrimonial
brickbat, and Charles Coburn
rounds-off the cast as the
irascible grandpa.

“Old Yeller”
The title-role in this whole-
some pioneering-adventure film
from Walt Disney is taken by
a lumbering, likeable pooch
who strays into the lives of a
struggling farming family and
quickly worms his way into
their affections. The soul of
amiability, he lets the small
son ride on his back and pull
his ears ; but wades in willingly
in face of danger from bears,
wild boars, an aggressive cow
who has just calved, and a
wolf. He survives all but the
wolf’s hydrophobia - infected
teeth, leaving a yellow pup that
he has sired to succeed him.
The Disney flair for giving a
clear picture of these natural
encounters —so brilliantly done
in his nature-study documen-
taries—comes out in every
episode. The story is feasible,
and the domestic scenes warm
and natural.
Fess Parker is the father who
is forced to leave his family to
go on an extended droving trip,
while his 16-year-old son takes-
over the home. This role is
given an earnest, manly slant
by Tommy Kirk. As the
younger brother, Kevin Cor-
coran is excellent, and Dorothy
Maguire gives a neat touch of
wry humor to her role of the
capable, anxious mother. But
Old Yeller’s performance has
the edge on 'em all.

Australian Guarantee Corp., Ltd.
I> ather wary of hire-purchase scrip
until the trading-banks showed the
way, the sharemarket changed its atti-
tude last year, and sent up the “other
finance” share-price index (Sydney Stock
Exchange) by 32 p.c. In the same period
the “all-ord.” index rose by 13 p.c.
Reflecting the enhanced status, yields,
at present prices, from shares in some
of the bigger h.-p. concerns are little
different from those obtainable from
scrip in their trading-bank associates, the
f.-p. £1 ords. in Australian Guarantee
Corp. returning £5 4s. 4d. p.c. from a
15 p.c div. at 575. 6d. and the “old”
£2O ords. in the Bank of N.S.W. (which
holds 40 p.c of A.G.C.’s ord. capital)
£4 14s. 9d. p.c. from a 9 p.c. div. at
£3B.
A steady recovery in motor-vehicle
sales, along with the great demand for
TV-receivers, provided most h.-p.
financiers with an opportunity to
increase outstandings over the last
financial year; but, while competition
for funds allowed very few reductions
in interest-rates on borrowed money, the
chase after new business brought some
concessions for hirers generally, and an
easing of the h.-p. charges on some classes
of transaction.
In general, the larger h.-p. cos. have
tended to increase their share of total
outstandings over the last couple of
years, A.G.C., one of the oldest and
largest. of the Australia-wide h.-p.
financiers, adding £11.9 million to its
h.-p. debts in the year to June 30 last,
compared with the £60.4 million added
to the total debt to h.-p. financiers in
the same period. This gain is all the more
noteworthy when it is remembered that
A.G.C. specialises in motor-vehicle
transactions (it has strong ties with the
distributors of Ford products) and
handled no TV business at all last term.
In common with other leading h.-p.
concerns, A.G.C. keeps much of the
insurance side of h.-p. financing within
the family, and the larger of its two
insurance offshoots, the successful Trans-
port and General, has contributed to the
increasing involvement of life- and
accident-offices by announcing its inten-
tion of writing certain classes of life-
contract. (National and General, the
Custom Credit insurance-subsidiary, also
plans to enter the life field.)
Other A.G.C. subsidiaries include
Traders Finance Corp., Ltd., Alliance
Finance Corp. (N.Z.), Ltd. (financing
sales of Ford vehicles in Australia and
N.Z. respectively), Empire Insurances,
Ltd., and A.G.C. (Pacific), Ltd., the last-
named co. being formed last year to
handle business in New Guinea and
Papua.
Group h.-p. turnover rose by £2l
million to a record £B5 million last term,
to give A.G.C. an even larger share of
the national h.-p. market, while the
premium-income of Transport and
General climbed by £303,885 to
£2,084,368, after deducting reinsurances
and commissions. At £1,332,186 earn-
ings also reached new heights, but the
rate of growth was well below that of
turnover, thq £171,898 improvement in
published figures dropping to £97,240
when an overprovision for tax in
1956-57 is taken into account. The
slimmer profit-margins arose, largely,
from a cut of 1 p.c. in motor-vehicle
h.-p. rates and the imposition of a 1 p.c.
stamp-duty on h.-p. contracts written in

The 15 p.c. ord. div.-rate was held with-
out difficulty, despite the extra £373,500
needed to cover the 2,490,000 ords. issued,
at a total premium of £1,556,250, to the
Bank of N.S.W. in July, 1957. No new
funds were introduced by this issue, the
fresh capital replacing existing liabilities.
Although the amount of borrowed
money at work rose by £5.1 million, the
decline in the earning-rate on ord.
capital continued, net earnings, claimed
after providing £1,074,452 (up £131,488)
for taxation and £142,674 (up £6788) for

covering pref. divs. and 20.8 p.c. on the
enlarged ord. capital, as against 30.1,
30.5, 46.2 and 45 p.c. back to 1954. Pro-
vision for unearned income was an
adequate 11 p.c. of outstandings.
Cash issues in 1953, 1954 and 1955
added £2,246,792 to paid capital, as
well as bringing-in £591,912 in share-
premiums, last term’s issue to the bank
lifting ord. capital to £6,225,000 and
share-premium reserve to £2,154,929. Of
the £650,000 pref. capital, £500,000
carries a cumulative 5 p.c. and the
balance 6, p.c.
The progress made by A.G.C. last term
is illustrated by the £12,192,171 jump in
group h.-p. outstandings, advances, etc.,
an average down-payment of more than
40 p.c. lending a high degree of security

The principal sources of borrowed funds
were all tapped during the year, and at
the end of the term there was an extra
£3,054,330 against debentures, £1,368,887
more owing to depositors and a further
£729,779 from the bank, the share-issue
leaving scope for the introduction of
even more outside money as required.
Still, if the demand for h.-p. finance con-
tinues to grow at the rate it did last year,
shareholders could have another oppor-
tunity to increase their stake in the co.
in the not-too-distant future. Latest
figures from the Commonwealth Statis-
tician show that the national h.-p. debt
rose by £24.3 million over the four
months to October 31 last, compared with
an increase of £13.5 million in the same
four months of 1957.
The prospects of uniform h.-p. legisla-
tion throughout Australia haven’t been
improved by the Victorian Government’s
setback in the State Upper House, but
there remains a strong possibility of
further statutory curbs on h.-p. activities.
However, unless unduly restrictive, any
new legislation would probably be
directed at the more-adventurous and
less-reputable h.-p. concerns rather than
at the major cos., and, on present

Associated Leathers, Ltd.
As a group, the 13 subsidiaries of
Associated Leathers, Ltd., squeezed
a lot more profit out of sales last term
than they did from a similar sales-figure
in 1956-57. A full year’s earnings from
the Zwar Bros, tannery at Beechworth
(Vic.) went into the accounts for the
first time, but lower raw-material costs
and changes in the sales-pattern also
appear to have been behind the recovery ;
with drought conditions contributing to
the improvement by swelling the supply
and reducing the cost of most skins and
hides.
Registered in Victoria in 1948, Asso-
ciated Leathers amalgamated the interests
of five well-established cos. engaged in
the leather industries of Australia and
New Zealand. The group operates five
tanneries and distributes leather, grindery,
saddlery, canvas, sporting-goods and a
variety of finished-leather products and
other lines, many of which are manu-
factured within the organisation. Sub-
sidiary cos. operate in all Australian
States and N.Z., exports to the U.K.,
Europe and the Far East being channelled
through offshoots in London and Hong
Kong.
The operating subsidiaries, many of
them better known than the parent co.,
include Michaelis, Hallenstein and Co.
Pty., Farleigh, Nettheim Pty., Glender-
mid, Ltd. (N.Z.), Interstate Rubber Co.
Pty., Rosenstamm Pty., Julius Cohn and
Co., Ltd., Zwar Bros. Pty., C. W. Hart
and Co. Pty. and Hedley’s Pty.
The parent’s paid capital, including
£196,250 in 5 p.c. prefs., reached
£1,626,950 at the end of the 1957 term
with the issue of 264,011 10s. ords. (at
19s. each) in exchange for tannery-plant,
etc., at Beechworth, the latest request to
shareholders going out in 1952, when
new scrip was offered at par, on a one-
for-four basis.
A five-year run of 9 p.c. ord. divs.
followed the maiden (8 p.c.) payout in
1949, earnings rising to a peak and the
div.-rate to 124 P-c. in 1955 on the
relaxation of certain Government con-
trols and an improvement in selling-
prices. After a sharp reverse and a
smaller (10 p.c.) div. in the 1956 term,
group fortunes reached their lowest level
to date in 1957, when keen competition
in local and overseas markets led to a
severe cut in profit-margins, an 8 p.c.
div., together with the pref. charge,
exceeding the net profit by £3404.
Overall sales were “practically un-
changed” last term (to June 30), but with
lower material costs and production
economies strengthening margins, earn-
ings were restored to the 1955-56 level,
an £83,326 lift in consolidated net profit
taking it to £204,191, of which £39,941
(up £950) came from investments. Pro-
vision for depreciation was £17,167
higher at £72,162, the tax-provision (up
£39,683 at £99,142) being calculated, pre-
sumably, after, allowing for losses in-
curred by a number of subsidiaries in the
preceding year:— -

9.3 p.c. All but one of the ord. divs.
have contained a tax-free element
(ranging from 5 p.c. to 4 p.c.), last term’s
payment virtually exhausting tax-paid
funds.
Although the growing use of plastics
and other synthetic materials as sub-
stitutes for leather, particularly in the
manufacture of footwear, could affect
future earnings, fluctuations in cost- and
market-prices are probably the co.'s
main problem. While admitting the trend
to synthetics in the footwear industry,
the board feels that there is still a “big
future” for sole-leather, and reports an
“ever-increasing” demand in both Aus-
tralian and overseas markets for the
group’s upper-leathers.
The sale of surplus land, etc., brought
in a capital-profit of £41,253 last term,
and, with the depreciation provision, out-
weighed the year's expenditure on plant
and premises by £45,059. Creditors and
provisions rose by £70.607, but with
stocks and book-debts more-or-less un-
changed, the group was able to cut the
liability to the bank by £171,917, put a
further £17,398 into listed scrip and add
£17,801 to holdings of cash, leaving
working-capital £128,327 stronger at a

Automotive and General Industries
A big improvement in sales of Simca
cars and the reorganisation of
vehicle-assembly activities put Automo-
tive and General Industries in a better
position last term, but, although 1957’s
£98.212 loss was replaced by a £135,412
profit, the co. still has a way to go if it
is to turn-in profits commensurate with
its bonus-inflated share-capital.
Two main obstacles in the way are the
current preferences of new-car buyers and
the uncertain and erratic demand for
agricultural equipment manufactured' by
Howard Auto-Cultivators Pty.—problem-
child of the Automotive and General
family.
The level of earnings is initially depen-
dent on the turnover of Austin vehicles,
for which the principal subsidiary holds
the Victorian franchise, and, while the
group had a rich time when sales were
booming, the number of Austin units
sold annually has fallen over the last
seven terms from a peak of nearly 10,000
•to 3605 (last term). Other interests have
been acquired in this period, but the
position hasn't been improved by the
growth of share-capital from the 1949
figure of £112,500 to the current
£1,665,500. No less than £983,100 of this
increase came from direct or indirect
bonus-issues.
Scrip to a face-value of approximately
£300,000 was exchanged for the £500,000
paid capital of Howard Auto-Cultivators
late in the 1955 term. However, demand
for agricultural implements and auto-
motive parts produced by the Howard
co. has since been affected by extreme

seasonal conditions and reductions in the
vehicle-output of some of its customers,
the co. following up a “substantial” loss
in 1956-57 with a £55,891 deficit last
term.
Finance and spare-parts offshoots have
proved more reliable as profit-winners,
further investments being made last term
in these interests.
Anticipating the transfer (completed in
1956) to British Motor Corp.’s Sydney
works of most of the assembly side of its
Austin business, Automotive and General
secured an Australia-wide concession for
Simca cars, and in 1955 commenced the
assembly and wholesale-distribution of
these vehicles. The purchase of Liberty
Motors (Aust.) Pty., about this time,
brought with it the Victorian franchise
for Stacatruc fork-lift trucks. Liberty
Motors, which has plans for the partial
manufacture of Stacatrucs, further spread
itself in the materials-handling field last
year with the purchase of the Victorian
assets of the Commonwealth Handling
Equipment Pool.
Including the h.-p. finance provided
during the term, turnover for the year
to June 30 last was steady at a little
under £9,000,000. Although 659 fewer
Austins were sold, the previous term’s
losses on vehicle-assembly and the dis-
tribution of Simcas gave way to profits ;
price-cuts, on which the group lost
heavily in 1956-57, helping to boost sales
of Simcas from 635 units to 1678 units.
This left Howard Auto-Cultivators as the
only subsidiary in the red and subsidiary
losses £88,177 lighter at £55,891.
As a whole, the group finished the
year £135,412 in front, after setting-aside
£lB,BOO (up £17,650) for taxation and
£48,346 (up £19,665) for depreciation and
amortisation:

While this was a considerable improve-
ment on the previous year’s effort, that
year’s losses and other “special deduc-
tions” in respect of leasehold improve-
ments reduced the liability for taxation
by about £62,500. Not properly charge-
able against the term’s results, a £127,243
write-down of Howard assets (charged to
pre-acquisition reserves) was, neverthe-
less, an almost complete offset to earnings
and somewhat surprising in view of the
directors’ statement in 1957 that “valua-
tions of stocks have been the subject of
close scrutiny and all prudent steps have
been taken in that regard.”
The write-down covered stocks
(£50,890), plant and equipment (£59,401),
and patent-rights and development
(£16,952) carried in the Howard accounts
since the date of acquisition.
After missing-out completely in the
previous term, shareholders collected a
5 p.c. div., the profit representing a return
of 8.1 p.c. on the all-ord. share-capital.
Financially the group is in quite good
shape, in spite of a net £297,391 increase
in stocks and a £401,048 jump in credi-
tors. H.-p. outstandings (£971,517),
deferred debts (£204,000) and sundry
debits are included with book-debts in

accounting for only £66,903 of the

relating, mainly, to sale of the North Mel-
bourne works, for most of the balance:

The purchase of the North Melbourne
property by the Victorian Government
(for £379,000) also left freeholds down by
£124,983, after allowing for amortisation
and the £228,106 spent on land and build-
ings during the year. According to the
board, the shift to factories in the Mel-
bourne suburbs of Moorabbin and
Heidelberg has lowered assembly-costs
and eliminated costly storage-charges.
Freeholds were last revalued in 1956.
Registration of Simca vehicles in the
first four months of the current term
(794 units) were well in front of those
for the same period in 1957 (484 units).
However, Austin sales appear to be a
little weaker, the keenly-competitive
nature of a new-car market still domin-
ated by Holden distributors being
emphasised by the recent round of price-
cuts. Under these conditions Automotive
and General’s chances of adding signi-
ficantly to earnings in the current year
may well depend on the result of efforts
made to build-up the turnover of the
Howard subsidiary.

New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd.
has been the case for some years,
the various non-mining activities of
New Guinea Goldfields provided the co.
with the bulk of its profit again last term.
A higher quantity of lower-grade ore
(42,113 tons, up 5239 tons) was mined,
two-thirds of it from the Golden Peaks
opencuts, and an extra 3088 tons (43,606
tons) milled, but mine-earnings were
again affected by a substantial loss from
the Koranga joint-workings. A landslide
disrupted sluicing-operations at Koranga
halfway through the year and frustrated
plans for working the richer sections of
the area. The actual loss incurred, how-
ever, was £4590 smaller at £18,264.
Head-values of opencut and under-
ground ore dropped from 0.3480 z. gold
to 0.2780 z. gold, but an improvement in
milling-efficiency (from 88.3 p.c. to 90.1
p.c.) limited the slip in production ; the
mill-feed yielding 10,9250 z. gold (down
15770 z.) and 13,3200 z. silver (down
15120 z.).
Ore reserves at June 30 last were calcu-
lated at 213,625 tons (up 12,245 tons),
variations in the tonnage and assay-
value of the Golden Peaks ore reducing
tfie average grade from 0.3390 z. to
0.270 z. gold. An interesting prospect at
Andersons Creek (near Wau) is at present
being investigated.
A lower scale of royalty-charges, intro-
duced in 1957, cut royalty-payments last
year by £8315 (to £4368) and, with the
gold subsidy £1505 fatter at £29,575 and
the reduction in the Koranga loss, the
mining-profit rose by £2680 to £19,948.
The co.’s logging and sawmilling
interests have been its best money-spinner
in recent years, and last term brought in
£44,012 of the £64,706 (up £11,625) profit
from non-mining activities. Curtailed by
forest-conservation measures in 1956-57,
the sawmill output rose from 1,894,806
super.-feet to 2,319,367 super.-feet, and
the granting of new timber-cutting per-
mits should help to stabilise future pro-
duction. Road-freighting (allied to the
timber business), power - generation,
general trading at the Wau depot and the
various agencies held by the Lae branch
all contributed to earnings, net profit from
all sources improving by £14,305 to
£84,654.
A div. of 3d. a stock-unit was sent out
last month, absorbing £55,905, capital-
returns in 1956 (6d.) and 1957 (3d.)
replacing divs. in those years and reduc-
ing paid-capital to £782,648 in 3s. 6d.
units. Difficulties still to be overcome


at Koranga are expected to
hold earnings in check in the
current year.
Proposals for extending the
Wau Valley coffee-plantation
from 40 acres to 100 acres have
been shelved until markets and
prices are a little more certain.
Most of the coffee already
planted has yet to reach the
bearing-stage, a crop of 8 to
9 tons of green coffee being
expected in the 1958-59 season.
At balance-date the co. was
able to cover liabilities of
£37,983 with current assets of
£276,222 (including £108,627 in
cash and bullion and £116,306
in stocks), the mine-property
showing in the accounts at
£504,979 and buildings, plant,
etc., at £487,267.

H. L. Brisbane & Wunder-
lich, Ltd.
Over the last three terms the
restricted tempo of build-
ing activity in West Australia
has checked the progress of
H. L. Brisbane and Wunder-
lich, Ltd. Nevertheless, by
widening the range of pro-
ducts turned-out at its six
Westralian factories, the co.
has coped fairly successfully
with variations in demand for
some of its old-established
lines, and both earnings and
dividends have been held at
a better-than-average level.
As Westralia’s largest manu-
.facturer of roofing-tiles and
main supplier of stainless-steel
products, H. L. Brisbane and
Wunderlich would seem to
have good long-term prospects,
and, although the current term
is unlikely to bring any marked
improvement in earnings, the
co.’s £1 Olds, don’t appear
over-expensive on present
market standards —at 395. A
12-j p.c. ord. div. (enriched by
a one-for-six bonus-issue in
1955) has been sent out in each
of the last six years and
maintenance of this div.-rate
would give buyers at 395. a
yield of £6 Bs. 2d. p.c.
Formed as H. L. Brisbane
and Co., Ltd., in 1929, the co.
took its present title in 1938,
after Wunderlich Ltd., had
taken a large shareholding in
exchange for its W.A. interests.
In addition to terra-cotta
roofing-tales and stainless-steel
products, the co. manufactures
stoneware ' sewerage - pipes,
aluminium window - frames,
curtain-walling, etc., numerous
sheet-metal lines, crockery,
pottery, bricks, facing-tiles and
refractories as well as carrying
on business as a glass-merchant
and shopfitter.
Ord. capital is £589,304 of
which £175,000 came from a
one-for-two par issue in 1954,
the funds raised at that time
going to finance extensions to
the Caversham tile-factory. The
balance (£88,733) of the
£678,037 paid capital carried
a cumulative 5 p.c. until last
term, when the div.-rate was
increased to 6 p.c.
Sales of roofing-tiles were
more-or-less static over the
year to June 30 last, but the
installation of deep sewerage-
systems in several country
centres strengthened sales of
sewerage-pipes, while expan-
sion of metal-work activities,
the introduction of a new line
of glazed facing-tiles and a
higher output from the Subiaco
pottery all helped to lift turn-
over by £74,103 to £1,584,489.
However, “severe” competition
and rising costs trimmed profit-
margins, leaving gross profit
£10.459 lighter at £316,152 and
pre-tax profit at 10.5 p.c. of
sales, as against 11.6 p.c. in
1956-57. Expenses were a
trifle lower and the provision
for depreciation down by £BlO
(at £49,185), but it was the
smaller provision for taxation
(down £14,980, at £60,300) that
turned a £9185 slip in pre-tax
earnings into a £5795 advance
in net profit. If allowance is
made for an overprovision for
tax in the previous term, the
actual improvement shows up
at £1051:

With visible reserves worth

capital, and current assets
£294,824 greater than total
liabilit es and provisions, the
co. is in sound shape financially,
although the steady growth of
working-capital has sprung,
partly, from the quieter trading-
conditions experienced in the
last few years. The 23,380 in-
crease in stocks was said to
include aluminium sections

this, relatively new, side of the

PLAIN TALES FROM DOWN UNDER
By R.R.D.
Tmplications of the present
-*■ Communist push against
Berlin are fairly evident.
Already the Russians have
Vienna in a stranglehold, be-
cause, if they chose to advance
out of Flungary, they could
take this city and with it the
strategic key to Europe—that
gap between the Alps and the
Carpathians which the
Romans first thought to
secure.
•Another diplomatic victory
in Berlin would add strength
to this threat and produce
a sort of strategic checkmate
in their favor on the European
chessboard. Failure would be
no great loss to the Russians,
either. They might have dis-
tracted the eyes of the Western
alliance long enough to allow
their plans to mature in the
Levant and they might also
cause dispersion of the Western
forces to counter the threat in
Germany. So the schwerpunkt
against Berlin must look a
pretty safe bet to the Com-
munist planners, especially
since it gives a chance for all
the muddled thinkers, like
Britain’s Aneurin Bevan, to
chime in with their views and
help to cloud the issue.
At War Now
But nothing that happens in
Europe must take our eyes
away for one instant from two
important facts. The first is
that the Communists are at
war with us ' and, however
much we may seek to prolong
this state of “peace” (and lose
all our advantages in so doing),
we cannot deny this.
The second fact is even more
important to Australia. Lenin
has clearly enunciated the
Communist doctrine: “Win
Asia, win all.” Khrushchev has
obviously added to this his own
improvement of winning
Africa, too; but, nonetheless,
the Communists now have
control of most of Asia. That
is what affects us, for we shall
eventually bear its brunt—
more precisely, unless we solve
the problem now, our sons and
grandsons will inherit it.
Let us accept these facts,
which are surely evident, and
work from them to find a
solution.
Of course, the West is
appraised of Communist aims,
but, by the very nature of its
democracy, it is unable to do
more than counter each blow
effectively as it is delivered.
Inability to seize the initiative
will never win a battle even if
it may wear an opponent down.
The time has been ripe for
heroic measures. More push,
and Suez might have been a
Western victory, accepted by
the world as fait accompli in
our favor. To divert the Nile
“Bullo didn't mind copping a black-eye yesterday, but
the postie went around skiting about it."
waters would have settled
Nasser’s hash at any stage,
quite apart from resolute
military action along the
Canal. But that has gone by
default, and the Communist
claw is now firmly established
in the Levant. Asia, caught
between this and the Chinese
threat, looks like dying in the
grip of Cancer the Crab. And
all for lack of quick, imagina-
tive use of the surgeon’s healing
knife.
Accept it so far. Then look
at what remains in Asia. A
series of toeholds ringing
round from South Korea
Hong Kong, Vietnam and
Siam —to Malaya; then,
Burma, India, Pakistan,' Iran
and Aden. Offshore lies
Japan ; the rest is in Com-
munist hands or in the melting-
pot. Our effort;, at the moment,
is limited to the countries listed
above.
Of them the greatest are
India and Japan, with Pakistan
also to be considered, though
limited by economics and by
geographical division.
Japan is out of the scope
of our influence, but has built
itself up, with American help,
into a Power which again looks
like being of world-stature.
Pakistan, apart from the in-
herent disadvantages of its
position, is too busy looking
inwards towards Kashmir to
be able to take its proper part
in the struggle against Com-
munism. India alone remains
as a possible foundation-stone
on which we can think of
rebuilding a settled Asia.
India the Key?
India is in the midst of a
bold experiment. As head of
a neutral, secular country,
Nehru is trying to educate and
organise India’s vast popula-
tion into a democracy which
may be a match for the Com-
munism of China. The struggle
in Asia is between India and
China. On the results of that
struggle will hang Asia’s fate
and ultimately our own. More
than that, India is the cham-
pion, perhaps involuntarily, of
Western ideas of democracy.
As such, its progress is watch-
ed by the uncommitted nations
of Asia and Africa. First of the
old Imperial territories, India
was granted its freedom and,
with this grant, took those
basic ideas of justice and the
rule of law which Britain had
bequeathed it. As a neutral
country, India must look more
favorably towards the side
which keeps this rule of law
than to the authors of the
Hungarian atrocities and the
Chinese regimented labor-
camps. Moreover, with this
grant of freedom, India took-
over a fund of good-
will towards the
civilisation that was
great enough to give
it what it asked
without a struggle.
But India needs
help—economic aid,
given without strings,
and (above all) un-
derstanding. Nehru
may seem to criticise
unfavorably any
Western idea that
does not measure up
to his standards,
while his own con-
duct of his country’s
affairs may irk those
who are not pre-
pared to accept this
constant nagging.
But at least it is kept
within tho family of
the British Common-
wealth, and home-
truths are sometimes
the most telling.
With this help and the lati-
tude which we (ourselves a
youthful nation just flexing our
muscles) should allow to youth,
India may well prove the
foundation-stone of a settled
world.
There is the opportunity, and
the initiative should be taken.
English eyes are fixed by tradi-
tion on Europe and the Levant
and American eyes on Japan
and Formosa rightly so,
because from these foci come
the most evident threats to
their own homelands. This is
where Australia, with a voice
which is heeded in the world’s
council, should step-in and
insist on her own effort and
that of the Western world
being put into India to save
Asia before all is lost.


And so...
By DEREK MAURICE
As the smiling old woman
removed his coat Amery
realised with a dazed
excitement everything
that was bound to come. He
had seen nothing before,
stupid fool. Or perhaps . . .
he stopped-off that train of
thought and corrected himself
. . . perhaps it was as well or
he might have put his oafish
Western foot through this
gossamer web of Oriental
elegance.
He dared to raise his eyes
and look over to Ato. Sure
enough, the other wizened hag
had removed her blouse and
was rolling her skirt up her
legs. Ato’s eyes were looking
towards a far corner of the
room, where the cats were
playing, and Amery hastily
turned away in case she should
see him.
He sat when asked and had
his tie removed. Shoes and
socks followed so rapidly and
efficiently that he scarcely
noticed them going. He was
wondering why this hadn’t
occurred to him when Mr.
Ikuna had outlined his itinerary
with a fluency wh : ch showed
how often foreign v.i.ps. must
have asked to visit Fujivama
and thought that they could do
it in an afternoon.
The gentle hands of" the
wizened old Japanese serving-
woman stood him up and
started unbuttoning his
trousers. Once more, the dazed
thrill of excitement overcame
him and he looked over —to
meet Ato’s eyes. She was tying
the sash of an orange kimono
which the woman had just
given her. The woman was
folding underclothes and bow-
ing herself out.
The crone behind Amery
handed him a blue kimono,
signing with her hands that
she found it impossible to
reach up in order to offer
it to him.
Ato’s American accent broke
in, laughing: “She says you
are too tall for her, but please
excuse having to put it on
yourself.”
Amery laughed nervously
and said, “Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much. Yes,
sorry I’m so big. Ha, ha.”
He caught himself starting
to blush and ended on a hasty
fit of coughing.
r T''HE woman behind him was
•*- now bowing herself out,
having folded his clothes and
placed them neatly on the floor
by a large vase of white,
rounded flowers.
Ato moved gracefully over
the floor towards a door on
the far side.
“We have our bath now,”
she said.
Amery remembered that it
was the grace of her walk that
had first struck him as she came
to meet him on the station-
platform. Though he had
almost recovered from his con-
fusion at Mr. Ikuna’s generosity
to the minor clerk of the firm
of Allen, Eates, the sight of
this unusually graceful Japanese
girl coming to meet him had
filled him once again with awe
at the fullness of the meaning
of hospitality in this surpris-
ing country. Mr. Eates had
obviously had so much of this
hospitality that he didn’t even
begrudge his newest clerk
taking the latest consignment
out to Mr. Ikuna’s country.
“This way,” she called to
him, and he followed the
orange kimono, cursing him-
self, as so many times before,
for his clumsy tardiness at
falling in with the Japanese
girl’s perfect politeness. She
had enveloped him in it from
the moment she had met the
train. Her perfect American
had changed as much as she
could change it when she found
he was English. She knew
all the dates once she found he
liked dates as well as money-
figures. She found the perfect
eating-place with a view of a
romantic valley when she
found he liked beauty. And
she even told him about her
favorite Japanese novels when
she found he liked books, too.
They had talked so much
that Amery found himself
wondering how he was going
to tear himself away in time
to make dinner-time at his
Tokyo hotel.
HThrough the door of the far
room he saw a large square
hole in the floor filled with
water from which a slight heat-
vapor was rising.
Ato was already unloosening
her orange kimono.
Whose idea had it been to
stay the night? Hers, of course,
he confessed grudgingly.
Obviously, this too was part
of Mr. Ikuna’s hospitality. But
it was exciting, just the same.
Ato's figure was as good as
it had promised to be. It was
she who had told him how
the older women had grown
thick legs from squatting on
floors and then had to wear
the kimono to cover it up. She,
like most modern girls, was
reverting to natural propor-
tions: her words. Amery took
a grip on himself and unloosed
the cord of his own kimono,
politely turning away as he
did so: Ato put her toe into
the water.
“It’s not too hot,” she said
without any constraint, and he
heard the water splash as she
sat down. “Do come in.”
Forcing himself to raise his
eyes to meet hers, Amery
approached the edge of the
bath. Ato was smiling at him
and soaping her arms. He
lowered his 6ft. into the water,
and suddenly realised what they
were both doing.
“My dear,” he cried impuls-
ively and touched her shoulder
with his hand.
Ato’s smile stopped as
though frozen, and she stiff-
ened.
“I beg your pardon, Mr.
Amery,” she said stiffly, her
American accent coming back
in her excitement. “This is not
the behavior of a gentleman.”
Amery’s new-found excite-
ment flushed back inside him
as the sea runs out alter
it has sent its outrunners too
far up the beach. Japanese
politeness had beaten him
again, he thought grimly. It
would have to be Charles
Amery who got himself into
a position like this to be
knocked back by international
protocol. Apologetically, he
picked up the soap by Ato’s
side and began soaping his
chest.
She smiled at him and
plunged under the water, which
rippled greenly over the pink
curves of thigh and leg.
Amery swallowed hard and
splashed water over his back.
Ato emerged streaming water.
“It is good to have water
after a- hot day in the sun,”
she said conversationally, rais-
ing herself up the side of the
bath like a gymnast.
“Oh yes,” he said and, feel-
ing that the situation called for
more cultured contributions
than he was giving, added: “We
don’t have big baths like this
in England, you know. Ours
are ugly things like a miniature
boat.”
Ato nodded. “I have heard
of them. Of course in Urbana
we only had showers —dread-
ful,” she added.
She rang the bell, and the
two old ladies returned from
the outside corridor where,
obviously, they had been wait-
ing.
Amery was so annoyed with
himself and with the laws of
Oriental decorum that he
refused to take his eyes otf
Ato as the slightly hunch-
backed serving-woman re-*
attired her. To his mortification
she showed no sign of annoy-
ance or embarrassment; he
wondered if she was even
aware of him, so well-trained
were her eyes not to look at
him. He wondered how much
reward he did get from seeing
nylon rolled on flesh and silk
pulled over hair. Convention
is a wonderful thing, he
thought; but was there

Post?
Dinner over, Ato suggested
a visit to a Japanese film,
and Amery found himself
forgetting the companion at his
side as he allowed himself to
be swept away by the mediaeval
hobgoblins conjured-up on the
screen. It would have been
even more exciting had he not
had to squeeze himself into a
seat at least four sizes too
small for him. Ato apologised
for this in advance.
“We are such a little race,”
she said. “Mr. Ikuna even had
difficulty in finding a girl tail
enough to act as guide for his
Western guests.”
When, however, the old
women began unrolling the
mattresses on the floor Amery
finally decided that, protocol
or no protocol, a word must
be spoken.
“Is this my room. Miss
Okenita?” he asked politely.
“Or is it your room ? Or,” with
a polite jest, but dangerously,
“is it supposed to be our
room?”
The old women seemed to
sense what he was saying and
paused in their work. Ato
spoke to one of them in a
rapid command ; the women
went out of the room. “It is
usual to sleep in this type of
room,” she said apologetically,
as though he had complained
of the accommodation. “There
are no hotels with beds in
Numazu” —with a disarming,
deprecatory smile and gesture.
“I’m sorry to appear ill-
bred,” he replied. “But I am
really used to having a room
to myself.”
Ato looked so surprised that
the crone laying down the bed
ventured to ask her his mean-
ing. They talked mono-
syllabically in their soft and
seemingly all-vowel language,
“It is so unusual,” she said
at last and with the first sign
of uncertainty as to any
behavioral problem. At the
same time the humor of the
situation seemed to appeal to
her, and she was laughing. The
old crone joined in, too, and
they talked to the third woman
who joined them, carrying a
tray of teacups and other
utensils. Amery felt himself
sinking into the earth under
their harmless feminine
giggling.
“Perhaps a screen?” he
finally brought forth.
Ato agreed, and one of the
crones was sent to get a screen
while the Japanese girl poured
Amery his tea and offered him
some sticky kind of sweetmeat
which was most pleasant and
had a pungent tang.
As the old crone undressed
him, Amery congratulated him-
self again on his presence of
mind. After one shock, his
heart might not have stood the
sight of Ato undressing in the
candlelight. The rustle of
feminine garments was hard
enough to bear, and the effort
to keep up the polite flow of
conversation which Ato,
apparently, could carry on
unperturbed throughout.
Finally the crone handed
him his kimono and went out,
bowing. Amery lowered him-
self on to his mattress with a
stifled sigh. Surely this was a
mighty day for the newest clerk
in Allan, Eates. As he dozed
he thought back to the last five
hours. Suddenly a cough above
him returned him dizzily to
earth. Ato was smiling down
at him.
“Have you everything you
require?” she asked primly,
and sat down on the edge of
the mattress.
“Oh, yes,” a surprised and,
if the truth be told, angry
Amery replied.
“Can I get you anything?”
she went on.
He thought rapidly, could
find nothing and was forced
to say so.
“You will not be used to
these beds, will you?” she
asked, still smiling politely.
“No,” he answered ; saw a
light, and, wondering at his
own courage, took a hand
which was lying on the cover.
"Pursuing the paradox with
obtuse Occidental thorough-
ness, the most Amery could
obtain was the suggestion that,
for the Japanese, a bath is
useful only for bathing.


Dutchy lost no time in spread-
ing the story, adding some-
thing every time, and Dutchy
had a very fertile brain, plus
a strong sense of dramatics.
He swore he would never let
me live it down, and he has
kept his word.
A couple of days later we
were passing old Jim’s camp,
and he called us over to have a
mug of tea and a hunk of
brownie. The incident wasn’t
mentioned, and to show that I
was his friend, and one to be
trusted, he produced a slug of
six. - pennyweights he had
washed that day. No greater
proof of friendship could be
offered than this from these
secretive old men. It was the
largest piece of virgin gold
we had seen. It was about the
size of an ordinary marble, and
we admired it and congratu-
lated him on his good luck.
When leaving him, he said,
“Keep it under your hats,
boys.” We did.
/'"VUR luck had not been so
good, so Tom Hennesy sug-
gested we give it away for the
winter and have a go at the
rabbits. Tom had a light
springcart and a good horse,
so we were set for transport.
At Tongy, 60 miles from
Mudgee and on the Talbragar
River, we had no trouble
getting paddocks. Tongy was
owned by Robert Marsden
Fitzgerald (“Bob Fitzgerald
at the Dabee Rocks”)
and managed by a chap
named Griffiths. Fitzgerald
visited Tongy once while I
was there. 1 saw him close,
sitting in the buggy when
Griffiths pulled-up to see how
we were getting on. He was
a very old man, and was
wrapped to the chin in rugs.
He spoke in a squeaky voice,
and his eyes seemed to be the
only, part of him alive. He
died about a year later.
Tongy was 40,000 acres, all
beautiful rich black soil, and
ran one sheep to the acre,
besides round abouf 1000-
head of cattle, all Herefords.
Two wars have taken 30,000
acres in soldier-settlements.
We used jam and strychnine
on the bunnies, and, after the
pollard and phosphorus of the
poison-carts, 1 was surprised at
the way it acted. It killed
almost instantly, and seldom
did a rabbit get more than
20yds. off the trail. The bait-
laying was very slow and could
not be done on such a scale as
with the poison-carts, though
I think the results were much
better, because we worked only
the proved feeding-grounds,
instead of baiting the entire
paddock. We were soon expert
skinners; Dutchy was excep-
tionally fast. None of the
work was hard, but we never
had any spare time.
As we had written again to
Young and Co., and had three
sheds to go to, we had only
six weeks on Tongy. Brewon
was our first, starting at
the end of June. Tom was
also a shearer, and had three
small sheds in the Mudgee
district. He was 64 years of
age, and had been shearing
for 44 years. He reckoned
this would be hrs last year, as
he was finding it a bit hard on
his back.
"\T7e got a good price for our
skins in Mudgee and
decided to travel by train to
Coonamble, as this was the
nearest rail-point to Brewon.
We had intended paying our
fare, which was much against
our principles, but Tom had
a friend who was a railway-
guard, and we rode with him
to Wallerawang, where he
introduced us to another guard,
who was going to Dubbo in
charge of a goods-train. He
told us to hop into an empty
truck, and he would not know
anything about it.
Dubbo was reached without
incident, though most of the
trip was in daylight. The
trains to Coonamble were
usually mixed—three passenger
and half-a-dozen trucks. These
were not considered a good
risk by the swagmen, and only
used in emergencies. So we
bought tickets, thus becoming
decent, law-abiding citizens.
Even when a policeman looked
into our compartment I was
able to look him straight in the
eye, and Dutchy said affably,
“Good morning, constable.”
The line from Dubbo to
Coonamble is 90 miles. Not
long opened, it was one of
the railways built by Whitely
King. An American, with get-
rich-quick ideas, he would
arrange with the Government
to finance and build railways.
None of the workers was paid
in cash, but were handed a
ticket which entitled them to
collect food and goods, up to
the value of 30s. per week,
from a store nominated by
Whitely King. * And it was
always a store controlled by
Whitely King. All the goods
were of the highest prices. When
the job was ended the men who
had worked for possibly 12
months were in the same posi-
tion as when they had started,
with Whitely King the only
gainer.
"Drewon, about 20 miles
below Carinda and on the
Macquarie River, was a good
shed. The boss was a quiet
bloke who knew his job and
was liked by all. The. men
were decent chaps, and we had
a good “babbler.” No big-
guns among the shearers, but
all capable men. The sheep
were a fair average.
Dutchy had been given a
learner’s pen and, having
done a lot of “barrowing” the
previous year, was showing-up
well. He posed as the flash
shearer, insisting that the
rousies call him “Sir,” or “Mr.
Bishop.” If he cut a sheep, he
would yell, “Tar on the tail,
and jump back quick, I can’t
stand the smell of a rouse-
about! ”
The pickers-up soon became
wary of him. As they stooped
to pick up a fleece he would
smartly dab the flat of the
machine, still running, on their
rears. This has something of
the effect of a mild electric-
shock, and the old Wolseleys,
if the tension-screw happened
to be a little too tight, would
run hot, and when jammed
onto thin pants it was some-
thing startling. Having experi-
enced it myself I can say the
first time I was caught I jumped
as though a snake had bitten
me.
Dutchy was always apolo-
getic, and would swear it was
an accident. If his victim was
still hostile he would promise
to sing half-a-dozen songs that
night. This always brought
peace, for the rousies knew
Dutchy would keep his word.
His popularity never faded.
Before the cut-out even the
boss was playing up to him.
Once when Dutchy cut a sheep
rather badly and called for
tar, the boss said: “Mr.
Bishop, I would say that sheep
required stitching-up.” Dutchy
replied: “Mr. Wilson, I would
say that he needed a bloody
surgeon.” The boss scratched
his head, and walked away,
grinning.
Brewon was the happiest
shed I have shorn in. Shearers
were noted for rough jokes,
and many were put over, but
always taken in good part.
And the jokers were first to
laugh if caught at their own
game. Dutchy remarked: “A
bloke couldn’t pick a row with
a blanky jackeroo!”
Incidentally, Brewon joined
Euroka, where the shearing-
machine was invented. Dunlop,
on the Darling, was the first
shed where the machines were
used on a full-scale shearing,
but Wolseley, who owned
Euroka, shore most of his
flock with the machines the
year before Dunlop. At that
time the machines were driven
by an endless rope, which was
very unsatisfactory, and was
soon superseded by the shaft
and friction-wheels.
Several sheds were due to
. cut-out at the same time
as Brewon, and races, with
the inevitable ball at night,
were organised at Carinda in
aid of the hospital. Dutchy
formed a band to play at the
dances, consisting of two con-
certinas, a fiddle, a mouth-
organ and a kerosene-drum. He
had them rehearsing till mid-
night for the final three nights,
but everyone was interested, so
there were no complaints about


lack of sleep. Singers and
reciters were put through
their paces until he was
satisfied.
The races were the usual
grass-fed, owners-up affairs of
the villages of the outback.
There were no handicaps. If
you owned a horse you
reckoned could gallop, ■ you
entered him, and rode him
yourself. If you weighed 12st.
or more, that was hard luck.
Everyone was happy, and if
you did win it was the
custom to hand the prize, be
it a bridle or a lady’s bracelet,
back to the to be
run for at the next meeting.
The ball was the most
looked-for event of the year.
There were no social distinc-
tions. So long as a man was
clean and tidy he need not
hesitate to ask a squatter's wife
to dance with him. You would
see a picker-up dancing with the
wife of the owner of 100,000
acres, and both enjoying every
minute of it.
The band was a great success.
Dutchy had rehearsed them
till they played in perfect time.
At the supper he was officially
complimented on the music and
the singing, which he had also
organised. Never backward in
coming forward, he replied in
a very neat speech, which was
heartily cheered. The M.C.,
Stepper Hayes, was a first-rate
man at his job, and was one of
the best-known step-dancers in
the West. It was clear daylight
when the dance broke-up, and
we joined hands and sang,
“Auld Lang Syne.” It would
be a long time before we forgot
the Cut-out Ball at Carinda.
TV/Tount Tenandra was our
next shed. On the western
side of the Warrumbungles, its
northern boundary was Goori-
anawa and its eastern was
Gumin. Small by the western
standard, there were 20
shearers, and about the same
number of shed-hands. About
40,000 sheep; so, with fine
weather, we would cut-out in
three weeks.
It had a new shed and huts,
and this was their second year
of the machines. Owned by
O. E. Friend, it was managed
by a chap named Woodward.
Friend, a Scotsman, lived in
Sydney, and was seldom at the
station. But when he was at
Mount Tenandra he was always
an object of curiosity, and
many ribald comments, as he
always wore a kilt.
When he came to the shed
on the second day of shearing
every man looked at him in
awe. He walked up and down
the board a few times,
apparently unaware of the
sensation he was creating,
spoke to Woodward, and
marched out again. Then the
boss was deluged with ques-
tions: “What the flamin' hell
does he dress up like that for?”
“Is he right in the head?”
“Where does he come from?”
The boss explained patiently
that it was the Scottish national
costume, and the wearer was
the owner of Mount Tenandra,
the man they were working for,
so he had to be treated with
respect. Several shearers swore
that when the season ended
they would go to Sydney and
buy the full regalia.
Brummy Field asked: “Does
he wear anything under that
skirt?” This stumped all of us,
even Woodward, who replied :
“I really don’t know, Brum.”
Brummy considered for a
while, then remarked: “Well,
boss, I don’t reckon I’ll be
getting one of them. A man
couldn't shear in one of those
things, if he wasn't wearing
something under it.”
Friend never interfered with
the running of the station, but
left everything to Woodward.
He was said to be very wealthy,
and Mount Tenandra was just
a hobby. His daily stroll, up
and down, was always looked
forward to with interest. Most
of the men had spent all their
lives in the bush, and their
only knowledge of the kilts had
been from pictures, which gave
no idea of the vivid colors
which made-up the full dress.
At Brewon I had been going
along quietly, building up my
tallies steadily, and now
decided I would go “for a
century or the sack.” I didn't
get either. The first time I
tried I was caught on the bell
with 96. Four days in the
nineties, and then I got the
coveted century. I watched the
boss as he counted-out my pen,
and asked him: “Are they
all right?” I was proud and
elated, and damned anxious, as
he took his time going over
them. When he replied: “All
well done ; if you always shear
as well as this you can always
get a pen here.” I know 1
blushed, for praise from the
boss of the board is the only
thing that ever makes a shearer
blush.
'V/'arragrin, near Mendooran,
was owned by D. J. Watt,
who also owned Ulinda and
Digilah stations. It was one
of the oldest stations in the
district, having been taken-up
in the early part of 1830, and
was noted as having more
kurrajong-trees per acre than
any place in N.S.W. It was
also famous as a camp for the
wool-teams, coming in from
the north-west.
As this was the middle of
the season there were usually
a few teams camped on the
creek every night. I noticed
the teams always crossed the
creek before camping, and
wondered at it. I was given
the explanation that if the
creek or river rose during the
night they would not be
stranded on the wrong side in
the morning. 1 found that all
teamsters made this a rule
wherever they might be. It
could be dry at any crossing,
but a storm 50 miles upstream
could hold-up a team for days.
During the 1902 strike the
teamsters refused to handle
wool shorn by non-union labor.
A few decided to carry “black"
wool from Calga, and got
along nicely until Yarragrin
Creek was reached. There the
union carriers met them, and
tried to persuade them to drop
the wool. They refused, and
the argument got very heated,
till revolvers were produced
by the teamsters, and the
unionists retired. But that
night the linchpins were taken
from the axles of all the
wagons, and before any had
travelled 100yds. they were flat
on the ground. Troopers were
brought from Mendooran, but
the unionists had faded into
the scrub.
It took all day to get the
wagons ready to travel again,
and in the night the ropes were
cut, and this was not dis-
covered until the bales were
falling off.
All the way to Mudgee they
were harassed, till in the final
stages they were escorted by
troopers. When they reached
Yarragrin on the return
journey they saw hanging from
a tall gum four effigies, each
bearing a placard with one of
their names.
There is also a story of
Yarragrin Creek which seems
a bit far-fetched. A bullock-
team, with a big load of wool,
bogged at the crossing, and
four teams, each of 20 bullocks,
were hooked on. As the teams
tightened the bar-chain the
wagon came up the bank, but
the bed of the creek came up
with it. Teamsters are noted
for their veracity, but the bed
of Yarragrin Creek seemed to
be still in position. Perhaps it
was pulled back again, but the
teamster who told the yarn
forgot to mention this.
Shearing went on smoothly.
I was keeping round the
century with the wethers, and
when the ewes came in L
bolted: 120 the first day, 134
the next. I kept over the 120-
mark till the cut-out. My best
tally still stands as 134; cer-
tainly not a big-gun shearer,
but I gained the reputation of
a good, clean shearer, which
counts more than a fast, rough
man. Fast, clean shearers are
born, not made. I saw Dick
Hinton shear 274 at Uliman in
1908, and every sheep was
pinked. 1 class Dick as the
best shearer 1 have seen at any
time.
'The gold-fever was torment-
-* . ing us again, so we made
for Mudgee. At Cobborah we
met a cocky who wanted two
shearers. He had about 4000
sheep, and a four-stand shed.
A very decent old bloke,
Sam Craig by name. He drove
us out to his place, and we
met the other two shearers,
Dave Williams and Jack
Burnett. Both were in their
fifties, and had only a couple
of seasons with machines. We
tuckered at the house, and
Mrs. Craig fed us till wc
couldn't eat another mouthful,
and then accused us of having
poor appetites.
The sheep were a mixed lot,
not having been classed, so we
took them as they came. Two
young chaps acted as pickers-
up, piece-pickers, wool-rollers,
and did the pressing after
knock-off. Sam was expert,
boss of the board, tar-boy and
broomie.
Dave was my pen-mate, and
we were fairly well matched as
far as shearing went, but l
had the advantage of youth,
and after a few days 1 drew
away. At the cut-out f was 150
in the lead, and had rung the
shed.

The Making of a Communist
Many attempts have been made
to explain what makes a Com-
munist tick. The appeal of
the creed to people of under-
privileged countries and to the under-
privileged people of more fortunate
lands is not hard to understand. To the
“have-nots” any philosophy which pro-
mises a despoiling of the “haves” is bound
to have a big appeal. A starving man
doesn’t look too closely at the label on
his food-packet.
But although this simple explanation
accounts for the ease with which Com-
munism wins converts among the
impoverished millions of Asia ; why in
the pre-war years it made such headway
among the depressed classes of France
and Italy ; why the war-torn lands of
East Europe accepted trustingly the
political system of their Russian “libera-
tors” —it doesn’t explain the conversion
to Communism of so many intellectuals
in the Western world. In Britain, in
America and in Australia are men and
women of good education and in com-
fortable circumstances who have become
ardent Communists. To classify them
all as inherently mad, bad or stupid is
simplifying things too much.
In the early years of the Russian
revolution many young writers in other
countries were moved to admire the new
regime, just as an earlier generation of
writers saw the French revolution as the
hope of the world. As time went on
many of these were disillusioned, as their
18th-century counterparts had been, but
the hard core remained, to receive con-
siderable reinforcement when the Nazi
invasion made Russia an unwilling ally
of the West. The post-war years saw
more and more defections from the party
as the crudities of Russian policy became
harder and harder to stomach. Soviet
aggression in Hungary was one occasion
for mass resignations; Khrushchev’s
“secret speech” attacking Stalin another.
Probably these two incidents were merely
the spark. Growing doubts and dis-
satisfactions needed a catalyst. They
provided it.
Good Intentions
IN explaining their own disillusionment
several former Communists have also
explained what leads so many intellec-
tuals to join the Communist party and
why they continue as members. Howard
Fast, American Leftist writer and a
member of the staff of the New York
“Daily Worker,” told his story in The
Naked God. It was the “secret speech”
that completed Fast’s disillusionment.
Douglas Hyde, of the London “Daily
Worker,” left the party much earlier, but
he had been a member for a much longer
period. Since his defection in 1948 he
has written several books exposing the
workings of Communism, and last year
at a Seato seminar in the Philippines he
read a paper explaining why “good
people with good intentions” join the
party. Hyde maintains that that descrip-
tion fits the majority of converts.
Hyde claims that the typical convert
to Communism is a young idealist in
revolt against racial and social injustice.
“It is right that there should be people
who are alert to injustice and who will
speak out against it. The Communist
movement throughout the country takes
such people and uses them for its own
purposes —and uses them effectively.”
Communism is able to do this because
many of these people feel frustrated and
restless and are filled with a feeling that
they don’t belong anywhere. As a world-
wide movement, it gives them a sense of
adventure and purpose from which they
draw satisfaction and strength. And
although Communists stoutly maintain
that they are opposed to all religion,
Communism has become for them a
substitute religion :
In my experience very few people indeed
join the Communist party for intellectual
reasons. In other words', there are very few
who make a careful study of Communist
theories and then as a consequence become
Communists... .It is quite wrong to sup-
pose that the intellectual is always guided
by his intellect. He is just as likely to be
guided by emotions as anyone else.
“Marxist Education”
Most recruits, says Hyde, are attracted
to the Communist party by some
campaign run by it or fellow-travellers —
a campaign on some industrial, social
or humanitarian question. Such cam-
paigns have nothing to do with the long-
term aims of Communism the real
Communist has no interest in social
reforms except as stepping-stones to
revolution —but the intellectual-idealist
isn’t aware of this. He becomes familiar
with party members, and when it is
suggested that, as he is working with
the party, he may as well join it, the
decision is not hard to make. The next
step is when he finds himself having to
defend Communism in discussion with
former friends and realises that he doesn’t
know all the answers. Seeking them
from a party member, he is advised to
attend classes in “Marxist education.”
Douglas Hyde should be able to speak
with authority on these classes ; he once
conducted them for the British Com-
munist party :
In my experience it was very rare
indeed for anyone to come to such classes
in order to argue. They came to receive
what we had to offer, and the reason was
that they were already committed by their
activities to a Communist position. Their
pride was at stake; they were already
involved. They were already under attack
as Communists. They came to receive the
ammunition for a fight in which they were
already engaged—to get the answers to the
awkward questions they were already being
asked.
The first effect of the indoctrination
course, says Hyde, is that it undermines
all the beliefs the person has previously
held. He learns that his life so far has
been meaningless because he has been
defeating his own purpose. In working
for reform he has been contributing to
the perpetuation of capitalism. He must
repudiate his past and accept a new set
of values and a new code of behavior.
What does he get in return? He gets a
new religion, although he doesn’t call it
that. He gets his belief that Communism
must come in every country throughout
the world and that if he and his comrades
work hard enough it will come in his
lifetime. But as this can only be brought
about through the collapse of the exist-
ing order, anything that can contribute to
that collapse acquires a virtue in his eyes.
Dedicated Men
indoctrination classes follow the same
-®- pattern in all countries, and their
graduates tend to become a uniform type,
accepting the tenets of the faith without
question and completely dedicated to the
cause. Both Howard Fast and Douglas
Hyde insist on this sense of dedication.
Fast says that “no one considers himself
a purer patriot than the Communist rank-
and-filer, and most often his actions tend
to underline this.” Hyde argues that even
betraying his own country becomes to
the true Communist a matter of personal
integrity ; he is dedicated to his cause
and sees himself as being true to that
cause when he works for countries other
than his own.
Hyde’s picture of young idealists
becoming perverted into traitors and, in
some lands, terrorists, is a tragic one.
Fortunately the events of the last few
years have shown that the process is not
entirely irreversible. Douglas Hyde
himself is proof that the subverted
idealist can shake himself free of the
clouds of unreason and back to sanity.
He told his Seato audience:
I believe that the fact that Communism
cuts so completely across the very nature
of man must in time bring about its down-
fall. That does not necessarily mean a
speedy downfall, but sooner or later it
must be destroyed from within.... Because
Communism is so intrinsically evil and
immoral, sooner or later men must rebel
against its evil. Sooner or later the con-
science of men revolts against the evil things
which Communism demands of it.
Howard Fast also believes that the
inherent evil of Communism will ulti-
mately destroy it, even in Russia. He
sees the Communist party as “a prison
for man’s best and boldest dreams,” and
for that reason doomed to failure.
The answer? Hyde thinks it lies in
offering youth something else:
It is we [the West] who should be trying
to capture the imagination of youth with
the ideal of changing the world. We have
never had in all man’s history such oppor-
tunity to change for the better than we have
today. Never before in man's history has
it been possible to think and plan in terms
of ending hunger and malnutrition through-
out the world. But these possibilities are
with us today.
That’s certainly a thought for the
people who run the Colombo Plan,
Unesco and the multifarious offshoots of
U.N.O. Perhaps these could be made
the outlet for the missionary zeal of
youth. Their present tendency seems to
be to attract the careerist.

RED MILL RUM.
Davis Cup Loss
The capacity crowd of
around 18,800 packing Bris-
bane’s Milton tennis-stadium
for each day’s play in the 1958
Davis Cup challenge-round had the
most, and in some ways the best,
for their money any challenge-
round crowd has had since Dwight
F. Davis, a leading young American
player of - the day, presented the
2170 z. silver rose-bowl as “a sort
of international challenge cup - ’ 59
years ago.
The “international” aspect of the
business was then confined to the
Americans trying to kid the British,
who had invented the game, to
come over and take them on.
Young Davis’s handsome trophy
did the trick, and a three-man
British team (A. W. Gore, E. D.
Black and H. Roper Barrett) crossed
the Atlantic to tackle the Yanks
in the first Davis Cup challenge-
round, played at Longwood, Boston,
in August, 1900. Represented by
M. D. Whitman, H. Ward and the
cup-donor himself, the Americans
won the first two singles and the
doubles with the loss of only one
set.
In 1904 the competition first
began to take on some real inter-
national flavor when France and
Belgium challenged, and the follow-
ing year Australasia and Austria
entered the courts. Today the Cup
is perhaps the world’s most com-
pletely international sporting event.
The 1958 round drew entries from
37 countries. The original rose-
bowl is now completely covered
with the inscribed results of
challenge-round matches. So is the
accompanying silver tray which
Davis donated in 1921 to cope with
the overflow of inscriptions. And
the w-alnut plinth with its silver
shields which Davis added further
in 1934 has space left for only
another five years’ results.
Returning to the 1958 event, the
Milton crowd got the most tennis
ever served-up in a challenge-round
—a total of 270 games. And in
terms of sustained tension, interest
and atmosphere they got some of
the best challenge-round tennis on
record —certainly the most exciting
since Bromwich and Quist collected
the trophy in 1939 after losing their
first two singles. But it was far
from being the best tennis seen
in a challenge-round.
The Q.L.T.A. staged the big
event very well and gave the retort
complete to the gloomers who had
opposed giving the challenge-round
to Brisbane on the ground that
there weren’t the facilities there
for it to be organised fittingly. But
the Q.L.T.A. could do nothing to
control the notorious weather that
makes Brisbane such a chancy
venue for big sporting events.
The challenge-round was played
on a court that was the tennis
equivalent of a cricket “sticky.”
and the tennis was about as much
first-class tennis as cricket is first-
class cricket in those circumstances.
While the matches were played in
enervating, sultry heat, the court
itself was rain-sodden and badly
cut-up, the balls became leadenly
soggy in a few games, and players
had to wear spiked shoes through-
out all matches after the first couple
of games of the first singles.
The resulting tennis was a battle
of errors rather than of winning
points, and the Australians made
the more errors and made them
at the worst possible times.
Repeatedly they lost games, sets
and matches after having them well
and truly in the bag. Anderson
set the pattern right from the start
in playing the first singles against
Olmedo. Anderson held set-point
in the first set, yet lost it. He won
the second set. And he lost both
the third and fourth sets after hold-
ing and losing several set-points.
That was the story all through the
round.
However, all this —poor playing
conditions and tennis that was
generally more errors than winners
—was minor background stuff.
The completely dominating high-
light of the 1958 challenge-round
was Alex Olmedo’s fantastically
successful debut in Cup tennis.
Having scraped their own barrel
dry, the Yanks took a dip into
their neighbors’ and came up with
■first-prize in the shape of young
Olmedo, a citizen of Peru. Never
heard of in these parts until a few
weeks ago; with comparatively
limited experience and no great
success in big tournament tennis;
and tossed straight into the deep
end of Davis Cup tennis, Olmedo
w'as a long-odds underdog against
Queenslander Mai Anderson in the
opening singles. For that matter,
(he chances of the whole American
team were completely written-off
before the round started. In fact,
seldom before have so many experts
gone so far out on the slippery
limb of prognostication—and come
such a frightful gutser.
The jungle-steam atmosphere at
Milton may have been home-from-
home for' the Peruvian. At all
events he very soon showed him-
self completely at home. Anderson,
who comes from a Queensland
cattle-station, should have been just
as much at home. But a year
oi so back Anderson managed to
suffer sunstroke at Wimbledon, and
he quickly showed that the torrid
Brisbane conditions were far from
his liking. He resorted to a wide-
brimmed white lid, w'hile Olmedo,
bare-headed, seemed to take the
heat in his stride.
After a tensely exciting four-setter
in which Anderson had the chance
to win every set, but succeeded in
taking-out only one, Olmedo won
8-6, 2-6, 9-7, 8-6. In the second
singles on the first day, Ashley
Cooper levelled the score for Aus-
tralia by beating Barry Mac Kay.
Mac Kay is a big, powerful young-
ster with a booming serve and a
ton of fighting spirit, but not a
great deal else in the way of tennis
science. Cooper dropped the first
set 4-6, but then polished-off the
next three sets 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
The doubles, on the second day,
was the match which the Australians
most decidedly should not have
lost; in fact, they should have won
it in straight sets. Again Olmedo
(partnered by Ham Richardson)
was the best player on the court,
and again it was a case of the
Australians (Anderson and Neale
Fraser) having it in the bag and
then making too many mistakes at
the wrong time against opponents
who were too good to permit any
lapses.
The statistics tell the story. Aus-
tralia scored 110 placements against
89 and served eight aces against
six. But they also served 10 double-
faults against four; netted 90 shots
against 63; and outed 67 against
55. The Australians won the first
two sets 12-10, 6-3. What was, in
present observer’s opinion, the most
vital game in the whole round came
then in the third set when the Aus-
tralians, with the game-score tied
at 14-all, had the Americans down
15-40 on Richardson’s service with
their own service to follow. Yet
they muffed a string of set-points
and, with them, the match. The
Americans won that set 16-14 and
the next two 6-3, 7-5. It was a
wonderfully exciting match and the
longest challenge-round doubles in
Cup history, going to a total of 82
games.
Even at that, the Australians
seemed to be still well and truly
in it. Anderson could be expected
pretty confidently to account for
Mac Kay, leaving Wimbledon and
U.S. titleholder Cooper fresh from
a day’s spell and fighting-fit to beat
a tired Olmedo. That, at any rate,
was the theory; unfortunately it
didn’t pan out.
If Olmedo had been good before,
he outdid himself in the vital match
against Cooper—very close all the
way, admittedly, but the Yankeru-
vian always had the edge when it
was called for. Final score was
8-6, 2-6, 9-7, 8-6. Although that
ended interest in the round. Ander-
son then made the score look a bit
more respectable in the record-
books when he beat Mac Kay in
straight sets in the final singles —
7-5, 13-11, 11-9.
And SOj j n the words of G.-G.
S’William Slim in handing over the
trophy, “We give the Americans
another loan of the Davis Cup.”
cann ot but be for the good of
tennis to see the Australian strangle-
hold on the Cup broken, however
temporarily. It would be an even
better thing to see the Australia-
D.S.A. joint stranglehold broken,
and the Cup collected for a change
by one of the lesser tennis countries
—Peru, for instance.
P. M.
Sydney Horses
Smart sprinter Royal King-
dom, favorite for the Canter-
bury Park Flying Handicap,
got away slowly and found the
task of conceding both a start
and weight beyond him,
though he managed third
money. Another Rosehill-
trained galloper, Mighty King-
dom, won the race in the smart


time of 1.12.3, showing quick
improvement upon his previ-
ous outing, in the Randwick
Flying Handicap on Boxing
Day. Maybe the stronger and
more experienced jockey R.
Selkrig got the best from him.
With so many January fix-
tures—twilight meetings among
them —there may not be
enough horses to go round
when the early February meet-
ings get under way. The late
January lists might have to
be pruned. The additional
fixtures will benefit owners of
moderate gallopers. A farci-
cal situation was created at
Canterbury Park when two
horses only, Jack’s Count at
4 to 1 on, and Bidgee Stream
5 to 2 against, competed in the
main distance event, the Club
Handicap. Four prizes (total-
ling £1200) were scheduled, but
owners of the other four accep-
tors decided to await another
day. Seems strange that more
owners were not interested.
Middle-distance horses are
not strong in numbers at the
best of times, though clubs do
their best to foster this type of
racing, and breeders are
encouraged to develop staying
types. At this time of the year
the best gallopers over a dist-
ance are on the easy list, but
there should be enough in
training to start a field of up
to a dozen or so. In the Can-
terbury fiasco N. McGrowdie
rode the pacemaker Bidgee
Stream, whose recent form had
been poor, and few conceded
him a chance of beating Jack’s
Count, ridden by G. Moore.
To make it easier for the
4-to-l-on favorite the pace-
maker ran wide at the top of
the straight, and Moore quickly
sent Jack’s Count through to
easy victory.
Strictly on form the grey
Never Mist looked a safe wager
for the Welter Handicap at
Canterbury Park, but he started
second - favorite. He won
easily. Patrons of the fixture
expected to see Nev£r Mist at
cramped odds, but Jazz Singer,
trained by T. J. Smith, was
installed a warm favorite the
moment betting began. He
finished in the ruck. Never
Mist came from the rear of
the field to win comfortably
from the not so well ridden
Sication, with Idyllic third.
Kateena cleared away with
a Two-year-old Maiden Handi-
cap at Randwick on Boxing
Day, which made her appear
a near certainty for the Canter-
bury Park Graduation Stakes
for that age-group. Despite
rumors that she wasn't fully fit,
the filly won by three lengths,
and it could have been more.
Kateena also ran the five
furlongs 37yds. in race-record
time. Racegoers should dis-
miss course rumors as so much
idle gossip.
Some trainers have all the
luck or a good share of it,
others get on to the wrong leg
and can’t do a thing right. At
the moment Rosebery mentor
L. J. O’Sullivan, who has been
a long while in racing and has
turned out hundreds of
winners, is having a lean trot.
O’Sullivan has started various
members of his string at recent
fixtures, and some have been
strongly fancied. Teranyan
won surprisingly at Warwick
Farm some weeks ago, then
failed in his races, while New
Spec doesn’t seem the horse
he was of a year or so ago.
He has failed at his latest
starts, though in a winning
position within the final fur-
long. Angevin, Consider, and
Bidgee Stream haven’t done
much about paying for their
feed bills, either.
Owner Norman Fox, who
had a lot of wins with Nag-
puni in both Australia and
America, has hopes that his
smart two-year-old Perouse,
easy winner of Tattersall’s
Nursery Handicap, will also
develop into a top performer.
Perouse, starting at odds-on,
covered the five furlongs in the
fast time of 59ysec. Fox
intends to give Perouse a light
let-up before he tackles the
better-class youngsters. He is
by Irani (E.) from Bleu Clair
(imp.). Irani, a successful sire
in England, is by Nearco,
unbeaten on the turf and lead-
ing sire in England for three
seasons.
Caesar (one of the most
versatile top-class gallopers to
have raced in Sydney and Mel-
bourne in recent seasons) had
an easy task in Tattersail’s Club
Cup at Randwick. Carrying
9st., he defeated Compass and
favorite Marksman, stablemate
of the winner, in the moderate
time of 2.34.3. In 1942 Dewar
won the Cup in 2.30.
Delta’s first progeny were
auctioned at the 1956 Rand-
wick sales, and his first yearling
from imported dam Scottish
Rake realised 3200gn5., the
bid of Randwick trainer M.
McCarten. Raced as Glomach,
he proved a failure ; but, trans-
ferred to trainer Harry Oakes,
who operates in the N.S.W.
northern districts, particularly
at Newcastle, the now four-
year-old gelding opened his
account by easily winning
Newcastle J.C.’s Maiden
Handicap on New Year’s Day.
He might come good now.

Melbourne Racing
A. H. Griffiths, owner in
partnership with his wife of the
good Nilo filly Hyleena, had
intended to spell the filly after
her- hat-trick of wins, but the
field in the Stradbroke Stakes
at Flemington on New Year’s
Day was small enough to de-
cide him to give Hyleena her
chance against the colts. She
went out odds-on favorite, but,
as happens so often, found the
task of spotting weight to the
colts too big a task. She went
under to Prince Lea, who was
in receipt of 101 b. from her.
There was no disgrace in the
defeat; Prince Lea has won
at his only two starts and looks
a colt above average. New
Zealand-bred, he is by Pride
of Kildare from Gold Spi.
Poor as the quality of the
fields in the traditional New
Year’s Day double at Fleming-
ton —the Standisn and Bagot
Handicaps—has been in recent
years, it touched an all-time
low this year. It is comment
enough on the class of the
Bagot field that Carbea won
the race comfortably. The
only other win in the Carey-
Beach Maid gelding’s record is
a two-year-old event at Wood-
end in Feb., 1957, and since
then Carbea has failed in all
sorts of weak races from
country improvers to city
trials.
Form proved right in the
Standish when the useful mare
Scenic Star raced right away
from her opponents over the
last furlong. Scenic Star had
looked unlucky to lose to Pride
of Colorado at the Valley
at her previous start, and
Pride of Colorado had
since won the rich Christ-
mas Handicap at Cheltenham
(S.A.). Scenic Star, who is by
Moondust from Belle Star, has
a good record. She has won
10 sprint races in South Aus-
tralia and Victoria, and is soon
to go to the stud. Well-mated,
she should throw some useful
sprinters.
Now a five-year-old, Pride
of Colorado has developed into
the best sprinter in Melbourne.
He won again at Moonee
Valley last Friday with the
heavy burden of 9.7, to make
it four in a row since he won
the Rosstown Plate at Caulfield
in November at outside odds.
Before that success his record
was poor ; in fact, he had won
only two races. It is common
enough for a stayer to come
good as a five-year-old, but
rare for a sprinter to improve
so much.
There was a remarkable
finish to the Second Bolinda
Stakes at the Valley last
Friday, when four horses
crossed the line with only
inches between them. The only
people who felt sure of the
winner were jockeys Burton,
Yeomans and Mitchell, who
all wanted to save with Joe
Gilmore, rider of Kildara. The
camera showed that Kildara
had finished fourth. Actually,
the winner, Zaldah, had a bare
6in. to spare from Kildara with
Double Image and Elder
squeezed between them. Not
many people believed that
Zaldah’s late run had earned
the money. It was the kind
of finish which would have
provoked an unpleasant scene
in pre-camera days.
Owner Sir Rupert Clarke,
tiainer “Bon” Hoysted and
jockey Ron Hutchinson scored
with both barrels at Caulfield
last Saturday when Jet Gun
won the Regent Handicap and
Fast Gun took the Granville
Slakes. Jet Gun is an enor-
mous three-year-old, more
than 17 hands high. A chest-
nut with silver mane and tail,
he is a remarkable-looking
animal. His owner, who is a
V.A.T.C. committee-man, is
also chairman of the King
Ranch Stud in Queensland
where Jet Gun’s sire, the
imported Flying Missel, stands.
Fast Gun is an Empyrean two-
year-old colt, and a useful
galloper. He won the
Debutant Stakes at Caulfield
last October at his first start,
and had won at Moonee
Valley prior to his Granville
success.
It was an excellent day’s
racing for the Hoysteds at
Caulfield. Following “Bon’s”
double in the first two races,
father Fred trained the last two
winners, Brocken and Rheo,
both ridden by Bill William-
son. That jockey has not had
his usual share of success this
season, but he was seen at his
best on Brocken. Williamson
is a first-rate money rider, and
it was his skill that landed the
heavy plunge which sent
Brocken out a 7-to-4 favorite.
He kicked Brocken first away,
dropped the gelding in behind

Westralian mare Dawdie,

disgruntled punters who pro-
tested noisily about Dawdie’s

provement on her last couple
of runs. Trainer Abe Jordan
brought Dawdie to Melbourne

The Trots
Leading driver J. C. Caffyn
won the first three races at
■ Harold Park on Saturday
night. Gipsy Volo beat the
5-to-2 favorite Barney Elect by
four lengths in the First
Qualifying Stakes.
In the Second Qualifying
Stakes Trusty Spring landed a
. betting plunge. Backed from
15 to 1 to 5 to 2, he beat Polly
Witten by three lengths with.
Bermagui a similar distance
away in third position. This
was Trusty Spring’s first race
after a long spell, his previous
form being poor.
A fall early in this race
caused confusion. “Fine Star
and Spring Fair fell in a
tangled heap in the centre of
the track shortly after leaving
the turn out of the straight the
first time round. The course
announcer warned drivers to
go outside, but some helpers
at the smash waved some in-
side. The confusion caused
some upsets in the race. But
Caffyn, behind Trusty Spring
in the lead, took the inside and
never lost a yard.
In the Third Qualifying
Stakes Brilliant Silver was
backed down to second-
favorite at 4 to 1. Although
badly away, he was in the lead
at the bell and went on to
score by half-a-length from
General Bruce, with the 7-to-4-
on favorite Star Peak three-
quarters of a length further
away third. Star Peak was at
the rear of the field most of
the way and put up a sound
performance to come from

The Cricketers
The second Test, virtually
won by Australia at stumps
on the fourth day, was a most
interesting game all through.
A sensational start, with Eng-
land 3-7 ; a fighting recovery,
led by May, with help from
Bailey and Cowdrey ; David-
son’s splendid first-innings
bowling, assisted by Meckiff;
a sparkling 167 by Harvey,
which swung the game, it
seemed, completely Australia’s
way, particularly when Aus-
tralia was 2 for around 250-
odd ; then England's second
recovery, this time led by
England's great fast-bowler
Statham, which brought Eng-
land right back into it ; finally,
England’s remarkable second-
innings collapse for 87, its
lowest score in living memory
on a good wicket—the collapse
engineered by Meckiff’s splen-
did bowling, assisted by David-
son. England’s batsmen, not
its bowlers, let it down.
At stumps on the fourth day
only “the Melbourne weather”
could stop an Australian vic-
tory. The weather had been
perfect for the first four days,
and helped, as well as the
interesting cricket provided, to
produce the hearteningly big
attendances on each day. It’s
to be hoped there’s the same
good weather and big crowds
at the third Test in Sydney,
beginning this Friday.
“Veryl”: A few years back
Australia’s Test-team con-
taiped a left-arm bowler,
Ernie Toshack, who had a bad
“press” but who, as a rule,
turned-in mighty good figures.
The same thing can more-or-
less be said of Australia’s
present left - arm bowler
Meckiff, who is either better/
than many critics claim or is
up against a really mediocre
batting side. One difference
between Toshack and Meckiff
is that no accusation of “throw-
ing” was ever made against
Tosh.
“C.R.H.”: Actually Freddie
Brown shares the record of 18
years between successive tours
(B. 24/12/’5B) —with no less a
person than W. G. Grace him-
self. The Doctor came out
to Australia twice, in 1873-74
and not again till % 1891-92 ;
incidentally, he led both teams.
Phil Mead almost equalled the
record by coming out succes-
sively in Johnny Douglas’s
1911-12 team and Percy Chap-
man’s in 1928-29, a gap of 17
years.

WOOL REVIEW
T ooking back over the British
wool-textile industry’s ex-
periences e in 1958—a year it
leaves “with few regrets”—the
wool-trade correspondent of
“Yorkshire Post” comments
that, to many sections, the
year “proved commercially un-
rewarding, and one of the few
things in its favor was that it
promised to close with market
sentiment slightly more opti-
mistic than at the opening”:
“Justifiably 'or otherwise,
there has grown up in recent
weeks a belief that the trade
Outlook is fundamentally more
healthy because of the gradual
scaling-down of prices and
stocks which has been effected
in the past 18 months of some-
what indifferent trade. Wool,
the principal raw material of
the industry, has not only
reached some of the most
attractive buying prices of
post-war years but has lately
given reassuring signs of
greater stability in price.
Stocks Reduced
“Meanwhile, stocks of manu-
factured goods, which have
been an impediment to pro-
duction for a considerable time,
are considered to have reached
an advanced stage of liquida-
tion, thereby paving the way
for production to feel im-
mediate benefit from any im-
provement in demand. Major
adjustments such as the
industry has experienced
during 1958 are never easy to
negotiate. The ills from which
the industry has suffered
sprang, in the first instance,
from the sharp fall in world
wool-values which began in
mid-1957 and continued with-
out intermission well into 1958.
The beginning of the decline
synchronised with the dear-
money phase in Britain’s
economy, applied as an anti-
inflation measure, and for a
time this was largely blamed
for the fall in wool-prices.
The Roof Cause
“In the light of fuller in-
formation since available, it is
now seen that this synchronisa-
tion was little more than
coincidence, for, while high
borrowing rates may not have
been without some effect on
United Kingdom wool-import-
ing and stock-carrying, the root
cause of the wool-price fall
was undoubtedly the simul-
taneous fall in wool-consump-
tion-which set in around that
time in practically all the prin-
cipal manufacturing countries.
“In the first half of 1957
world wool-consumption was
at one of the highest levels
recorded since the war, but by
the end of the corresponding
period of 1958 it had fallen
about 17 per cent., with de-
clines in individual countries
ranging from three per cent, in
Italy and eight per cent, in
France to 13 per cent, in This
country [Britain] and 28 per
cent, in the United States.
“The two first-mentioned
have since recorded sharper

declines in consumption than
their contemporaries, implying
that the falling-off was merely
later to develop in the case of
France and Italy. For the
most part the decline showed
signs of having been arrested
in the later months of 1958, and
recently issued figures reveal
that both wool-consumption
and top-production in the
•United Kingdom during
October were fractionally
higher than in the preceding
month and also higher than a
year earlier.
“While it is still early to
suggest that the recession in
consumption has been reversed,
there are encouraging indica-
tions that it may have been
checked and, as conditions are
never static, a slight upward
move may be a reasonable
expectation.
“If the figures for 10 months
—the most recent yet available
—can be taken as a criterion
for the year, wool-consumption
in the United Kingdom
during 1958 will prove to be
about 10 per cent, lower than
in 1957, and top-production
\2\ per cent, lower, while other
reductions on a year ago will
be approximately as follows:
Worsted-yarn deliveries, 14 per
cent.; woollen-yarn produc-
tion, 10 per cent.; woven wool-
cloth deliveries, per cent.
Man-made Fibres
“Significant, if relatively less
important as a total, is that
man-made fibre tops entering
worsted drawing in the United
Kingdom this year may be up
to 25 per cent, less than last
year; an indication either
of style changes or that cheaper
wool is making it more diffi-
cult for synthetic fibres to com-
pete as successfully in wool-
textile production.
“During this difficult year
the experience of many indi-
vidual firms has been anything
but stimulating. The trading
results of many public com-
panies for a financial year
covering the -greater part of
1958 show that business
generally has been much less
remunerative, and there are
numerous smaller firms which
will feel satisfied at the way
they haVe weathered the set-
back if their accounts balance
on the right side.
Drop in Wool Prices
“A fall in world wool-prices
which, from the highest point
of 1957, may have been any-
thing from 40 to 50 per cent,
according to type, has neces-
sarily involved heavy losses on
stocks. There were long
periods during which almost
every bale of wool arriving in
the country was ‘wrong’ in
price by the time it arrived,
owing to the continued fall in
primary market values while
it was en route. Although part
of this stock may have been
sold under contract, in the
form of tops or yarns, before
its arrival, the losses incurred
on margins of unsold working
stock have been nevertheless
severe, and this experience of
the wool - importing -and
-manipulating trades has had
its parallel throughout sub-
sequent stages of manufacture
and distribution.
“In terms of balance-sheet
results, 1958 must probably
rank among the least successful
of post-war years, with losses
on stocks alone eating heavily
into profits which might other-
wise have been shown.
A Bright Side
“The year has not been with-
out its brighter features, one of
the most encouraging of which
is Britain’s continued expan-
sion as an exporter of wool
tops. With only 10 months’
figures available at the moment
of writing, there is distinct
promise that 1958 exports of
tops from this country will
exceed the record 1957 volume
of 83.2-million lb.
“This splendid record is
partly due to much-increased
shipments to China, which
country at the end of
October had already taken
50 per cent, more tops from
Britain than during the whole
of 1957. China now takes pre-
cedence over" Canada and
India —traditionally the largest
overseas customers for United
Kingdom tops and these
larger shipments to the Far
East are more than counter-
balancing a temporary decrease
which the general recession has
effected in United Kingdom

passing into spinning and
weaving at home, it seems
appropriate to emphasise that
vßritain’s woolcombing capacity
is geared for an output in
excess of home-market require-
ments at their highest level.
Carpet Industry
“Another section which can
look on 1958 as a satisfactory
year is the carpet industry,
which, though organisationally
outside the wool - textile
industry, is a- large-scale wool-
consumer. Over most of the
year the carpet trade has been
running at one of the highest
levels yet recorded, and none
will begrudge this welcome
activity to an industry which —
by reason of enforced suspen-
sion of production—suffered
more than most during the war
years.
“Only in relatively recent
times has the expansion in
post-war housing enabled the
carpet industry to recover
something of its war-time
arrears of demand, and there
have been occasions during
1958 when more than one-
third of all the wool entering
woollen yarn in the United
Kingdom has been going into
carpet-yarn production. This
healthy home trade, allied to a
well-maintained export trade,
has made the carpet trade one
of the brighter spots in British
wool-textile production over
the greater part of the year.
“At the most recent date for
which figures are available,
carpet output in 1958 was
showing an increase of 10 per
cent, over the corresponding
period of 1957, and inquiries
suggest that the later months
of this year saw the industry
still working under pressure in
most sections,
Cloth Setbacks
“On the other hand, both
woollen and worsted apparel-
cloths, and the yarns from
which they are made, have had
a somewhat indifferent year,
with a cautious home-market
buying mostly from hand-to-
mouth ; with unsold stocks of
manufactured goods represent-
ing, in certain spheres at any
rate, an obstacle to further pro-
duction ; and with the world
recession in textiles generally
reflected-in an export trade
approximately 124 per 'cent, in
yardage below that of last
year. The biggest export set-
back has been in the United
States, where the much-criti-
cised tariff-quota is responsible
for heavy shipments for a few
months and negligible trade for
the remainder of the year.
“After the chastening experi-
ences of 1958, the industfy as
a whole is likely to approach
the New Year with an.
optimism tempered by caution,
but a- slightly better feeling
undoubtedly exists.
“Rightly or wrongly, the con-
viction gains ground that the
industry has now felt the full
impact of a recession which
may have been due in part to
earlier overproduction in rela-
tion to demand, that the
resultant imbalance has been
largely redressed and that the
structure of values —especially
in the raw material—has fully
discounted any weaker in-
fluences in the situation.
“Preponderant commercial
opinion is that the recovery
will be a gradual process;
indeed, it is hoped that it will
be gradual, as any sharp im-
provement would be viewed
with misgivings not conducive
to the steady growth of con-
fidence. At the same time, the
trade does look for better
things in the New Year.”
U.K. Unemployment
/commenting on the Com-
mons debate on unemploy-
ment in Britain—a national
average of 2.4 per cent. —
“Manchester Guardian” notes
that “the real problem is not
to create work for an army of
long-term unemployed but to
assist the processes of indus-
trial change within a relatively
prosperous economy. Coal,
railways, textiles and others of
the older industries are con-
tracting, but they are bound
to contract, and no Govern-
ment could order things other-
wise. Nor is such contraction
a national disaster: it is
healthy and right that new
processes should supersede the
old. »
“The trouble—which no
political party has so far
tackled effectively—is that the
older industries have produced
dense, concentrations of em-
ployment in particular locali-
ties, so that contraction hits
certain localities particularly
heavily. But this contraction
has not been brought about
by local causes, and a cure
cannot be applied locally.
“There is an obvious temp-
tation to say that all that is
needed is to guide or to force
new industrial enterprises into
the old mould, but the outcome
of doing this —even if it could
be done —would be to freeze
the location of British industry
in an obsolete pattern, to the
detriment of all industry. A
healthy general economy will
take up local slack, and the
social capital invested, say, in
a colliery town need not be
wasted if the local pits close.
But the stimulus to keep it
going cannot be a local injec-
tion. A new national road-
system, for instance, may do
more to help isolated mining
valleys than any attempt to
send a new factory there by
edict.”
That, of course, is a long-
term view. For the immediate
present, the same paper sug-
gests, “there remains the short-
term need to alleviate local
suffering made the more
acute for the evidence of pros-
perity around it. The import-
ant fact is that, at the worst,
this is a marginal need: even
in the areas of heaviest unem-
ployment nine people are still
likely to be in work for every
one without a job. There are
small communities utterly de-
pendent on one pit or one mill,
but they are small, and com-
plete -dependence of this sort
is rare.

in productivity of about 3 per

easygoing optimists who see
our [Britain’s] salvation in
regular wage-increases paid for

tion. The real picture, and the
real probability for the future,
is very different.”
British Exports
“'T'wo cheers” from London
“News Chronicle” for
Britain’s import and export
figures for November:
“The trade-gap is the smallest
since the war —if the months
of dock-strikes which cut off
trade are discounted. The
absolute value of the exports


are the highest for a year-and-
a-half, and continued progress
has been made in the all-
important dollar-markets.
“The flaw in the situation is
that many of our exports are
being bought on tick. Sterling
countries are using their sterl-
ing balances, supplemented by
loans, to buy British goods, and
the role of London as an inter-
national banking centre is
again enhanced. But credit has
its limits, and what is borrowed
has to be repaid.
“Many of the Common-
wealth countries, especially
India and New Zealand, have
used up a large portion of their
sterling reserves. They will not
be able to go on buying at the
present rate unless international
demand for their products
picks up. New Zealand’s posi-
tion is improving, but India is
still in dire straits.
“The recovery of the
American economy may restore
the situation in time. If it
does not, we [Britain] must
expect the export-market to
contract and the difficulties of
the Commonwealth countries
to increase. Two cheers are
enough for the moment.”
To which. “Yorkshire Post”
adds “this country’s [Britain’s]
exports reached the total of
£291 million in November,
which is the highest in any
month since May, 1957. Our
trade in North , American
markets has shown a most
welcome expansion during the
past two months; and the
total of exports to the United
States during November was
the highest ever recorded.
“These achievements offer
gratifying evidence of the
Berlin “Die Zeit"
enterprise of Britain’s traders.
Our manufacturers must be
more than a little tired of
receiving gratuitous advice
from critics who seem to think
British industry does not know
how to fulfil the needs of our
foreign customers and market
its goods abroad. Such figures
as. these for November show
what nonsense this is.”
Pacifist Provocation
T ondon “Daily Telegraph”
' comment on the nuclear-
disarmament campaigners who
invaded a R.A.F. rocket-base
in Norfolk and were ungently
dealt with:
“How much good it will do
their [the demonstrators’] cause
is another question. The British
public, while generally ready
to admire the sincerity of a
Mrs. Pankhurst or a Gandhi,
tends to resent such methods
of gaining political ends. In
this case, what many people
may well resent is the implica-
tion that they have given little
thought to the vital issues of
nuclear warfare, and can be
induced to think them out only
by processions and picketing.
Objectors to rocket-bases have
every right to say what they
think, but no right to do any-
thing they like. And if, by
making forcible entry, they get
more than they like, they have
no right to complain.”
Suez
Prompted by the Socialists’
raking-up of the Suez
affair, London “Daily Mail”
offers a “few appropriate final
words”:
“Nobody in public life any-
where in the Western alliance
can look back on this episode
with satisfaction. Neither Sir
Anthony Eden nor members
of his Government ; neither
the Leader of the Opposition
nor members of the Shadow
Cabinet; neither the President
of the U.S. nor his advisers.
“To blame the Service com-
manders, who carried out suc-
cessfully the task they were
allotted is like a batsman
blaming his bat when he is
out for a duck. The Cabinet
must have known in advance
how long it would take to
mount the invasion. They
must have known that our
military potential was such
that it would take months to
prepare the expedition.
“Even so, had the advance
continued another 24 hours
the canal would have been in
Washington ( U.S.A.) “Post”'
“ SHOULDN'T WE HAVE REINS OR SOMETHING ON IT?”
the hands of the British. That
it was called off was a severe
blow to the prestige of this
country. An occupation of the
canal zone would have been
well within our military
means, but it would have
severely strained our financial
resources. Here the U.S.
comes into the picture.
“The Suez enterprise could
have been made a success only
with the financial backing of
America. So far from this
being forthcoming, it was
actually used in opposition
to us. President Eisenhower
should have made his attitude
clear to us not halfway
through the invasion but be-
fore it started.
“Mr. Gaitskell and Mr.
Bevan were fully entitled to
oppose the policy of force, but
once the movement had begun
their public clamor contributed
towards its failure. The
Opposition put every obstacle
they could in the way of its
successful conclusion, and
showed they would willingly
sacrifice the prestige of the
country for a political aim.”
Various Voices
Britain's Home Secretary.
Mr. R. A. Bailer: “The real
difficulty about the Labor or
Socialist philosophy is that it
is a mixture of altruism-that
is, concern for the good of
others with acquisitiveness,
which is a desire for the goods
of others; and these two
things really do not mix. You
cannot be jealous and gener-
ous at one and the same time.”
President Prasad of India:
“The Commonwealth repre-
sents an unorganised organisa-
tion of nations completely
free. Yet each is drawn and
bound by invisible bonds
which have not required any
formal treaty. It may well
furnish the pattern for one
world organisation, when
ideological differences give
place to the more fruitful idea
of peaceful co-existence and
universal co-operation.”
Mr. H. A. Watkinson
(Britain’s Minister of Trans-
port) : “The opposite to the
Communist. way of life is the
free-enterprise way of life,
and it is by showing that the
people of the free world can
live better and more securely
on a basis of free enterprise
that we hold the bastion of
freedom against the constant
attempt at Communist infiltra-
tion. With the whole Com-
monwealth and all like-
minded nations we must sit
down together to build a
trading system, based on an
expanding free - enterprise
economy, which can show the
world that Communism really
does not work.”

of every little point (and there
are plenty in shearing) and
enjoying every minute of it.
They squabbled and cursed,
and, as they were both masters
of lurid repartee, the shed was
always lively. Jack finished in
front, and Dutchy’s only
comment was: “Ah, well, it’s
not every man that is drummer
in four sheds running.” But
he was proud of me, and never
forgot to mention, when we
were talking to shearers, that
I had rung Craigielea. And he
always spoke as though there
had been 20 shearers, instead
of four.
The day of the cut-out was
October 3, and my 21st birth-
day (Dutchy’s was two days
later). So Mrs. Craig insisted
on a party (no grog). There
were about 20 people there,
and we had a nice night.
Dutchy sang all his saddest
songs, and made all the women
happy, which sounds peculiar,
but is true, for the women of
that time enjoyed nothing
better than a good cry. A
young abo. was very good on
the kurrajong-leaf; Jack and
Dave gave a couple of recita-
tions ; and a girl, Mary Beck,
sang “The Ballad of the
Drover” in a nice clear voice.
A German chap sang “Watch
on the Rhine,” and I sang
“Hughie” and “Goorianawa.”
Every item was well received,
and at two-o’clock we ended
with “Auld Lang Syne.”
We said good-bye to Sam
and Mrs. Craig with regret.
She gave us strict injunctions
to take care of ourselves, and
loaded our tucker-bags up to
the neck. They were a fine old
couple, Yffiose on iy re g re { was
that they had had no children.
We had to promise to come
back next season, but promises
like these are hard for wan-
derers such as we were to
keep. I never saw them again.
T\ave had a sulky, and Jack
had a bicycle, and both
had pens at Guntawang. They
had shorn there the previous
year, and the boss of the board
was a good friend of Jack’s,
so he thought he could get us
in.
We put all the swags in the
sulky, and I got in with Dave.
Jack rode the bike a couple of
miles, then leaned it against a
tree, and started walking.
Dutchy hung on to the back
of the sulky till we came to
the bike ; then he mounted it
and rode on past Jack. When
we caught Jack he got in the
sulky, and I ran behind till we
came to where Dutchy had
left the bike ; then Jack took-
over again, and the perform-
ance was repeated. This method
of travelling was used a lot
in the bush. Two men with
one bike could do 50 miles
a day without any trouble.
We reached Guntawang in
plenty of time, but did not get
on, despite Jack’s efforts on
our behalf. Pens had been
promised, and the boss could
not break his word. I could
see his point, and agreed with
him. When I saw the sheep
I was not sorry to have missed

big tallies being cut with them.
was -then called
Eumeralla. Richard Rouse
had taken it up in 1830,
being one of the first
settlers in the Cudgegong
Valley, and his holdings
were enormous. After the Gul-
gong gold-rush they were cut
down by the influx of immi-
grants, who had come for gold
and found the land a surer way
of making a living. The
descendants of Richard Rouse
sold what was left, in 1903, to
Sir Hugh Denison, who
changed the name to Eumeralla.
When he resold if 10 years later
the old name was used again.
The old hands of the district
never spoke of Eumeralla, but
always of Guntawang.
During Rouse’s time it was
one of the best-known stations
in the country. For many
years it was worked by convict
labor. The convict-barracks
were still in good order,
with a “punishment post”
set up in front of the
main door. An ironbark
post Bft. high, with shackles
for hands and feet, it made
my back twitch as I looked at
it and thought of a man
trussed-up and helpless, scream-
ing, as the “cat” cut his back
to pieces.
(In my schooldays I had
known an “old lag” who when
he was drunk would pull off
his shirt and show what a
flogger could do. His back was
ridged from shoulders to loins.)
T> ouse was famous as a horse-
breeder, and any horse
wearing the “crooked R” was
prized all over the country.
His cattle were also well known,
and his sheep were noted for
their fine wool.

that I first heard of him. Pigs
were his hobby. He had some
hundreds of pigs, and several
men were kept busy attending
to them.

clean. All food was cooked,
and this was the particular job
of one man. At Charlton
several* men were discussing
cooks and their capabilities.
When a well-known shearer’s
cook was mentioned, one of the
shearers snorted, “Cook? Him
cook! Why, that blankard
was cookin’ for Rouse’s pigs,
an’ got the sack for being too
flamin’ dirty.” Once a cook
got the reputation of being
unfit to cook for Rouse’s pigs
it was the end of him in the
sheds, ringbarking gangs or
burning-off camps.
TCive miles towards Mudgee
was the Belinfante bridge
over the Cudgegong River,
named after a doctor who was
drowned at the crossing some
years before the bridge was
built. Dr. Belinfante was
attempting the ford at half-
flood when his horses panicked
and the buggy overturned. He
was tangled-up in the reins and
drowned, but his wife managed
to struggle to the bank and
.save herself. On the Mudgee
side of the bridge the remains of
Stewart’s store were to be seen.
Stewart’s store was the scene
of the shooting of Angel and
Thurston, in 1885. The two
men had been cattle-duffing in
the Coonamble district, and
had been captured and lodged
in jail. While awaiting trial
they had broken out, and the
lockup-keeper was killed in
the process. Though leg-ironed
and handcuffed, they managed
to reach Mungerie station,
where, at a timbergetter’s camp,
they got rid of their irons.
Working for Cuthbert
Featherstonhaugh, senr., who
then owned Mungerie, in 1908
I was digging out rabbit-
burrows when I came across
an old morticing-axe and a
pair of handcuffs. When
Featherstonhaugh saw these
he told riie that the other irons
had been found a few years
before near the same spot, and,
though buried for over 20
years, were identified by the
police as the irons worn by
Angel and Thurston. I gave
them to Featherstonhaugh, and
he had them, with the other
pieces, on the wall of his office
some years afterwards when I
called in at Mungerie.
From Mungerie the two men
made for the Warrumbungles,
and hid in a rough place, where
they could watch for any
pursuers. Having friends 'at
Box Ridge, a small village at
the foot of the mountains,
they were always warned if the
police were about, by smoke-
signals in the day and fires
at night. The hideout was
known for many years after
as Angel’s Lookout. Thurston
was hoping to contact a relative
and get enough money to get to
America. By this time the men
were outlawed, and £5OO
dead or alive —was on each of
them. The money proved too
great a temptation. They were
given away, and were shot by
the police at Charlie Stewart’s
store at Cullenbone.

WINTER TWILIGHT
When with blue cones the veronica
puts out the harsh white light,
this is the garden-time betrayed,
and venturing here, the quick, shrill child
halts as if afraid.
All that puts out the harsh, white light
seems friendly to a lover,
but a child runs in where the dull hearth glows
and the mug on the table is warm and full.
Yet, in this kindness, nobody knows
how strange it was to be overtaken,
to stand as still as a folded parrot,
and then to fly in and wish to be out
beside the blue bush—to glimpse again
the trap that moved in the quiet.

rule, he is caned by the captain
of his house. No master, apart
from the headmaster and the
senior master of the lower
school, can inflict physical
punishment. The boys take
care of their own sinners, and
few boys go through Eton
without a beating from an
older boy.
A boy must learn to be
judged and punished, as well
as to pass judgment and inflict
punishment. Nine of the last
12 Lord Chief Justices of Eng-
land were Eton boys.
At the top of Eton school-
life is a club of boys known
as the Eton Society, or “Pop.”
There’s no mistaking these
young demigods; they wear
tail-coats trimmed with braid,
black - and - white checkered
trousers, wing-collars and
white ties, a flower in their
buttonholes. But their most
striking ornamentation is the
waistcoat, which permits the
boys to express their individu-
ality. I saw a waistcoat made
from leopard-skin and another
from a French flag.
Many of these waistcoats
are very old, having been
handed down—or, more prob-
ably, sold —from one boy to
another. Every Eton boy
hopes to be elected to Pop,
which has a strictly limited
membership of 20. As there
are 1160 boys at Eton, most of
them are disappointed.
The Pop members have a
pleasant club-room, with a
telephone, and the line runs
hot with calls to girls. The
Pop boys are the only scholars
allowed to go to the movies,
and they form the top dis-
ciplinary body. The first
requirement for Pop members
is charm. Social standing and
scholastic or sporting ability
count hardly at all.
Between Pop at the top and
the fags at the bottom there
are intermediate grades of
power and privilege, the most
important being the captain of
each house and the captain of
the “collegers,” the 70 brightest
students of Eton, who live
together in the original 15th-
century building. These cap-
tains keep the younger boys
in line inside their own living-
quarters.
No boy is allowed to spend
more than 10s. a week, and
“And apart from all that, old boy, she snores in
C Sharp Minor!"
most have less. Some of this
money is spent by the older
boys on a specially mild beer
served at the Christopher Tap
Inn, where the boys learn to
sink their tankards like men.
The Christopher Tap is the
only pub they are allowed to
patronise. The innkeeper said
that in 30 years he could not
recall a scholar having too
much to drink.
Despite its regimentation,
Eton claims that it doesn’t try
to force a boy’s thinking into
conventional channels, and it
points to the 32 extra-curricular
organisations run by the boys
themselves. The 50 members
of the Political Society meet
weekly to hear a guest-speaker,
then bombard him with ques-
tions. Speakers in 1958
included the Foreign Secretary,
the governor of the Bank of
England, Douglas Fairbanks
and Sir Gerald Templar,
among others.
Other groups include the
Archaeological Society, the
Essay Group, the Literary
Association, the Musical
Group and the Film Society.
Some boys spend their spare
time in the carpentry-shop.
Eton is by no means the
most expensive school in Eng-
land. Yearly fees amount to
about £4OO, with extras. It
could be fairly said that £3OO
is for tuition and lodging, the
other £lOO for the Eton tie.
Some schools charge up to
£6OO a year and scholastically
have better records than Eton.
But the fact remains that the
Eton tie takes a man into the
best jobs, the best clubs and
the highest society.
I asked Rachael Birley, elder
daughter of Eton’s headmaster,
Mr. Robert Birley, if she could
put her finger on the mysteri-
ous hallmark of the Eton boy.
Miss Birley, a Chelsea artist,
lived at Eton for some years.
She said: “Eton boys are
perfectly sure that they have
had the very best schooling in
the world. This makes for
confidence. But having fault-
less manners they can conceal
beautifully the fact that they
know they are superior. It’s
really quite simple. Eton is a
500-year-old habit. It’s as
enduring as man.”
“Suppose somebody drops
an atom-bomb and smashes the
place flat?” I said.
“Elovv utterly impossible!”
said Miss Birley. “Anyway,
the school could carry on in
tents.”
“Eton in tents?”
“The boys would still be
Eton boys,” she said. “Eton
isn’t only part of England—•
it’s a state of mind.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Education
The latest idea of the N.S.W.
Department of Education is to
classify pupils according to age,
and it is planned to ask the
parents of children “who are
in classes beyond their age” to
consider permitting them to
repeat the class they are in
now. The reason for this is
that “some children had been
accelerated beyond their age-
limit because of pressure in
recent years in the infants’
classes.” The results of this
arrangement would “be seen
in the next few years,” and it
seemed “much more beneficial
to the children if they were
to be placed in their right age-
groups.”
If this is “modern” education,
give me the old-fashioned type
any day, when a child was
classed according to ability and
allowed to make the most of it
instead of being strait-
jacketed into an arbitrary age-
classification which offers no
encouragement to a child of
exceptional ability and elimi-
nates any incentive for the not-
so-clever.
The child who is kept back
merely because of an illogical
age-limit will soon become
bored with work that is all too
easy and decide that it is not
worth the effort anyway. In-
stead of being encouraged to
set an example, he will
become a source of trouble to
teacher and class alike.
Those parents who are
fortunate enough to be able to
send their children to a private
school (G.P.S. and others) will
at least be giving them a chance
to progress according to their
abilities. Nor is entrance to
these schools confined only to
children of parents who can
afford the fees, for many of
them now have scholarships
which will allow a child of ex-
ceptional ability but meagre
financial backing to obtain an
education to which, his merits
entitle him.— Parent (N.S.W.).
Clean Air
It was stated (B. 17/12/’5B)
that “no Clean Air Act has yet
been passed in any Australian
State, but the first steps towards
such a move have been taken
in N.S.W.”
I have before me a copy of
“An Act to Make Provision for
Abating the Pollution of the
Air” (No. 6125), dated Novem-
ber 20, 1957. This was passed
by the Victorian State Govern-
ment and promulgated in
March, 1958. According to
paragraph 1 this Act may be
cited as the “Clean Air Act,
1957.”
I understand that the Act
has not so far been enforced
because the Department of
Health, which has the respon-
sibility of administering it, has
not yet prepared the necessary
regulations to make it effective,
but that is being done now.
These regulations will cover
“ F'rinstance, if We Was livin' in Plato's Utopia these
craft Would be carryin' BEER!”
many aspects—including the
definition of dark smoke and
dense smoke, the regulation
and control of the emission of
smoke and air-impurities—
and will, among other things,
prescribe authorised fuels and
prohibit or control the burning
of other fuels in fireplaces used
in any industrial plant.
There is one important
departure from the U.K. Clean
Air Act in that the Victorian
Government specifically defines
“dark smoke” to be as dark
or darker than Shade 2 on the
Ringelmann Chart.
So, although pollution of the
air in industrial areas in Vic-
toria is not comparable with
that of Sydney, the Victorian
Government, under Henry
Bolte, has been the first to
make a move in the right direc-
tion. — Campbell Joe (Vic.).
Passenger Transport
The trend in passenger trans-
port is indicated in recent
figures from the Westralian
Government Tramways. Pas-
sengers carried for 1957-58
totalled 28,186,975, a drop of
1,741,139 on the previous year,
and a startling contrast to the
48,000,000 carried in 1948.
The loss on the services in-
creased during the year by
£32,401 to bring the year’s
deficit to £293,783, or almost
per passenger.
There is the newly-consti-
tuted Metropolitan Transport
Trust, formed to take-over the
bus services in the metropoli-
tan area. This will have a
tough job, as some Of the con-
cerns were pretty hard-pressed
at the takeover.
With the public turning their
backs on public transport and
buying more cars, deficits
could easily go higher in the
future. Some solution must be
found. The people who use
the bus services must pay the
cost, and the men who run
them must see that this cost is
a figure which the users can
afford to pay. Tiddles
(W.A.).
Toys
Representations by toy-
manufacturers for the control
of imported toys make me
wonder if the Australian
economy can afford this in-
dustry.
If other countries can make
toys two or three times as
cheaply, why not let them?
Why should we pay extra for
the dubious pleasure of buying
Australian-made toys?
Japanese toys may or may
not be inferior, but surely the
buyer has a right to decide this
for himself in as wide a market
as possible.
Further, if Australia buys
more Japanese toys, it will
enable Japan to buy more of
our wool. And surely ours is
a wool, not a toy, economy.
—Fragmos (N.S.W.).
Churches and Communism
Many people find it hard to
understand the attitude of the
churches to Communism (B.
19/11/’5B). Most of them con-
demn it as anti-Christian and
anti-God, which it obviously
and avowedly is, and the
Roman Catholics have gone so
far as to say that a man cannot
be at the same time a member
of their church and a Com-
munist.
Yet plenty of devout people
are, at least, Communist sym-
pathisers, and most churches
do their best, often in the face
of severe discouragement, to
maintain friendly relations
with Governments and citizens
of Communist countries. The
discouragement does not come
only from the Corns. For
example, when the late Angli-
can primate of Australia
visited China, a country where
he had worked for years and
had many friends, and after-
wards set down his impressions
of what he had seen and heard,
public reaction ranged from
statements that he had been
completely hoodwinked to
charges that he had, wittingly
or unwittingly, betrayed the
Western cause by shaking the
bloodstained hands of Mao
and co.
Of course the Communists,
if they were consistent, would
have nothing to do with the
churches. They teach that
there is no God, that science
is the light of the world, and
Marxist dogma the crowning
achievement of science (non-
sense, in any case, for a dogma
is the antithesis of science), and
that man is purely a product
of his material environment, so
that, in a perfect (i.e., Com-
munist) environment, he will
himself become perfect. All
these are directly opposed, not
just to the doctrines of any one
church but to the basic pos-
tulates of Christianity, held by
all the churches. But the
Communists find it expedient,
when dealing with people not
entirely in their power, not to
insist on these points. It is
this expediency that gives the
churches their opportunity.
It must be remembered that
to the Christian all men are
alike weak and sinful, unable
to help themselves, and to be


saved only by the grace of
God. It is their duty, not to
convert men, for only God can
do that, but to bear witness to
their faith before the uncon-
verted. Also, though they must
hate sin, they must love sinners,
for all men are sinners, and
all alike children of God and
loved by God. Therefore,
while hating and opposing
Communism as utterly evil,
they must seek every oppor-
tunity for intercourse and
friendship with Communists,
in order to set before them an
example of a better way of
life. It is a rather fine distinc-
tion, which even a large num-
ber of Christians seem not to
understand.
So the leaders of the
churches have the difficult task
ot confronting Communism in
such a way that they will not
alienate the affections of Com-
munists or their sympathisers,
but they are always liable to
be misunderstood by their own
people for doing so. Yet, if
they can do it, the Communists
have no defence except to
isolate themselves completely,
and that, apparently, is the last
thing they want to do, as it
would end their chances of
further recruiting.
History has shown that no
man can be guaranteed
immune from the power Ot
Christian witness. From the
penitent thief onwards, the
records show plenty of highly
improbable converts. It is a
method of opposing evil which
has eventually succeeded when
it has been conscientiously
practised. Can we say as much
of armed force, or even econo-
mic aid with strings? It
behoves all of us who believe
in a civilisation based on
Christian values to try to
understand what our spiritual
leaders are doing and, to the
limit of our powers, to support
them.— Magnoon (Q.).
Labor
The real reason for Labor's
defeat at the recent Federal
elections was not the leadership
of Dr. Evatt, the intrusion of
the D.L.P., or the fear of
Communist influence on
Labor’s thinking and planning.
It was the fundamental change
which has taken place in the
Australian way of life in recent
years.
Labor has been beaten five
times in the last 10 years. It
was beaten in 1949 when Ben
Chifley was leader ; it was
beaten again in 1951, 1954 and
1955. In 1958 it suffered the
biggest defeat of all—even
though it put forward a policy
“ Dammit—does anyone have a match ?”
calculated to appeal to the
selfish instincts of a big pro-
portion of the electors.
Even the Government’s
staunchest friends would hardly
contend that its record,
particularly during the past
three years, was calculated to
appeal strongly to the electors
and win new friends ; but
nevertheless it won them, and
it now has a bigger majority
than it ever had before, with
immediate control of the
Senate.
The explanation lies in the
long-sustained prosperity which
has created basic new values
among “average” people. Fifty
years ago, when Labor was
fighting to win a place in the
political field, the average
worker was largely at the
mercy of his employer, who
worked him long hours for
small wages and threatened to
sack him if he asked for some-
thing better. Today the great
mass of workers, including
many professional people,
enjoy the protection of the
Arbitration Court, which fixes
their wages and conditions of
employment and grants them
annual leave, sick-leave and
long-service leave.
Penalty-rates are also pro-
vided for overtime and week-
end work, even where it forms
part of an ordinary five-day
week. Years ago only favored
Government employees enjoyed
superannuation, but today even
small organisations have their
own schemes, many of them
non-contributory. To cap it
all, there is the age-pension,
which belongs as a right to men
and women whose income is
not otherwise sufficient to keep
them when they reach stipu-
lated ages.
Only the Labor party
approved such benefits years
ago, but today they are accepted
as part of our way of life by
all political parties in Aus-
tralia, and there is no longer
any real need for.a Labor party
to protect and advance the
interests of the workers. The
younger generation have cele-
brated their independence by
supporting a middle-of-the-road
party which has now accepted
both the theory and practice
of the Welfare State and has
adapted its thinking and plan-
ning accordingly.
If I were a Labor propa-
gandist today I would find it
hard to produce arguments to
convince the average young
working man that support of a
particular party was essential
to maintain his way of life.
On the contrary, it would be
much easier to convince him
that any change might
worsen rather than improve
his lot. Commonsense tells
him that political annihilation
awaits any party which
attempts to interfere with the
amenities of modern industrial
life, and it is his fair guess that
no Government would be so
foolish as to attempt to do so.
—Peter Simple (N.S.W.).
Breathing-spaces in W.A.
The twin cities, Kalgoorlie-
Boulder, are about as far from
anywhere else as you could
expect to find a community of
20,000 people anywhere in the
world; the surrounding
country isn't far short of desert,
and any sportsman with an
urge to shoot a little game
would think that, by going a
few miles out of the town, he’d
be able to blaze away without
inconveniencing anyone or
interfering with anyone else’s
activites.
He couldn’t be much more
wrong. There are lakes out
from Kalgoorlie which abound
in wildfowl at certain times
and where goldfields sportsmen
have been shooting for over
half-a-century. Now they’re
being told they’re trespassing
—the lakes are on pastoral
leases which cover practically
all the surrounding country,
and the pastoralists are kicking.
That's an indication of how
the big State’s natural resources
are being squandered. A lot
of that country wouldn’t carry
a goanna to 100 acres in four
years out of five ; and stock-
ing it is bound to ruin it
eventually. Fifty years ago it
was covered and held together
by some of the hardiest arboreal
types in the world —trees in-
ured to desert conditions, and
about the only trees in the
world capable of containing
the desert and holding it back.
Other countries faced with the
problem of advancing deserts
are buying seed of these native
trees and planting them in an
attempt to stop the deserts from
taking over the whole of their
countries. Westralia is stock-
ing this country in a short-
sighted attempt to wring a few
coppers out of it now, and the
stock are destroying the herb-
age they’re feeding on. Once
that native flora is removed the
desert will advance into the
wheatbelt.
There’s only one way in
which W.A.’s agricultural land
can be protected, and that’s by
maintaining the existing natural


buffer between if and the
desert. That requires a change
of political thought. Politicians
will have to get out of the habit
of regarding W.A. as essenti-
ally a primary-producing State
where every acre of arable land
must be reserved for agriculture
and where every effort must
be made to increase primary
production now. That attitude
has already resulted in the
alienation of big areas of land
scarcely fitted for agriculture,
but which could easily and
cheaply provide breathing-room
for overcrowded cities. It was
given as the reason why a big
area of lake country between
Mandurah and B u n b u r y
couldn’t be held as a reserve for
native flora and fauna with
provision for hunting and
recreation —there were one or
two small pockets which could
be used for garden land.
W.A. is going ahead indus-
trially, the population is in-
creasing, and within a few
decades there’ll be big indus-
trial centres all over the south-
west, and they’ll be crowded
out after the manner of in-
dustrial centres everywhere.
Provision could be made now
to have big areas of unoccupied
land within an hour or two’s
run of almost any centre. All
that’s involved is the reserving
of land which is hardly worth
the cost of development now
and which nobody has been
anxious to own in the past.
That will cost practically
nothing at present. In a few
years’ time it may involve heavy
payments for resumption. And
by then the natural beauty will
have been destroyed.— Pieter
Nuyts (W.A.).
Sick-leave
One section of the industrial
awards (in Queensland at least)
which requires review is that
dealing with sick-leave. In the
majority of awards —and in all
those covered by the A.W.U.
—the worker accumulates sick-
phy at the rate of half-a-day
per month, making a full day
each eight weeks worked. He
may take two days off on full
pay after 16 weeks’ work with-
out having to produce a medi-
cal certificate, but the employer
may demand a statutory
declaration to the effect that
he was unable to work on the
days he was absent. Few em-
ployers demand this formality,
because “taking a sickie” has
become almost a recognised
practice in most industries.
Sick-pay may accumulate
for a year (or for longer by
private agreement with the
employer), but normally, when
an employee has completed
one year’s service with an
organisation, his sick-leave ex-
pires and he starts afresh.
This has led to abuse of the
system from both sides, par-
ticularly in industries depen-
dent on seasonal labor. In the
sugar-industry the eighth to
tenth week sees a crop of “one-
day sickies,” and at the six-
teenth week the “two - day
sickies” crop-up. If the season
runs to 24 weeks, the last week
is somewhat hectic, with those
whose sick-pay has been taken
out working doublers to make
up for those who are cutting-
out what appgars to be (to
them) their just entitlement.
One can hardly blame a
worker for taking out what
he considers to be a just en-
titlement. If he has three days’
“sick” chalked-up and leaves
his employment at season-end,
that is (to him) a three-day
“cop” for the boss —so he takes
it out in' dribs and drabs,
always making a two-day limit
to avoid the necessary medical
certificate.
Again, suppose that his
honesty, principle, or ethics —
call it what you will —forbid
him to take out this accumula-
tion and he falls sick, say,
during the first three weeks of
new employment. He then has
no sick-pay reserve to fall
back on.
At one period I was work-
ing with a large building con-
tractor and had some ex-
perience with the costing of
jobs. Carpenters and painters
were not (by their award) en-
titled to accumulated sick-
leave. They had (I think —this
was back in 1952) 4s. per week
sick - allowance tacked - on to
their wages along with their
tool-allowance. When they got
sick their wages just stopped.
However, when laborers
under A.W.U. awards were
being estimated to a job, the
cost of their anticipated sick-
leave was always added to the
estimate. This justifies the
workers’ claim that if they
don’t take it, the boss cops it,
because in this case the boss
did cop it, having added it
onto the initial cost of the job.
It would be far better if
sick-leave was allowed to accu-
mulate, and if not taken out,
paid in cash at the termination
of service. Industry would
benefit in the end by better
attendance. Industry is, in any
case, already paying the cost,
has allowed for the cost, and
does not appear any the worse
for it.
At one sugar-mill I know,
one crew rosters its sick-leave
to ensure that everything is
convenient for each man to
get his “doubler” when some-
one is “sick.” How much is
the boss paying for this time?
He pays £3 5s. 9d. for the
“sick” man and £6 11s. 6d.
for the replacements to work
“doublers” —usually shared in
two four-hour stints by the
oncoming and offgoing shifts.
A dead loss of £6 11s. 6d. to
management .on paper, but, as
I’ve pointed out, management
is well awake to the practice
and costs ahead.

ASIAN AND MIDDLE EAST MARKETS
[From R. E. G. Cunningham]
At this time, when Western
demand for our wool and
meat is shrinking, we must look
closer to home for future
markets.
The creation of a wool-
market in any country is
dependent on the purchasing-
power of the people of that
country being raised.
No such problem exists with
meat, because we should be
able to deliver and sell our
mutton much cheaper and
supply a better quality—than
that produced in certain
countries in Asia and the
Middle East.
The countries alluded to are
Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan,
Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran,
Afghanistan, India, Pakistan,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaya and Singapore in
fact, anywhere where people of
the Moslem religion are to be
found. A huge market for
tinned meats is also available
among the big Moslem popula-
tion in Africa.
Mohammedans are meat-
eaters, who prefer sheep or
goat-flesh and have no pro-
hibition against killing.
Buddhists, on the other
hand, have a total pro-
hibition against killing any
animal, but, nevertheless,
are meat-eaters and buy their
supplies from Moslem vendors
in each country, as also do
the Hindu untouchables.
In the area stretching from
Suez and the Bosphorus to
Singapore, and in the various
other countries mentioned, there
is a total potential meat-eating
population which would exceed
600-million people, including
Moslem, Buddhist, Hindu un-
touchables and Parsees. Of
these, about 50-million have the
purchasing -power of the
average Australian. This means
that there is a huge market
available. If each of these
potential buyers bought
Australian meat once every
five days, it would be equal to
Australia’s 10-million people
buying meat daily for that
period.
The success of any scheme
for supplying this meat, I
submit, will depend wholly on
our setting-up a Moslem
slaughterhouse in Australia and
bringing two Moslem butchers
from each of the countries
mentioned to do the actual
killing. Who brings the sheep
up to the killing-board is of no
account, nor does it matter if
the carcass is handled by a
person of any other religion
after the killing has been done
by a Moslem. This simplifies
the process, because Aus-
tralians could handle the sheep
up to the killing-board and
deal with the carcass. .
It would be necessary to have
these abattoirs isolated from
any others and to publicise their
existence throughout the world
by means of photographs,
radio, television and the press.
By direct propaganda to the
countries affected and also by
special branding of the car-
casses and labelling of any tins,
we should make known the
fact that a genuine Moslem
slaughterhouse had been estab-
lished here in a. Christian
country. The presence of two
representatives from each
country and one mullah, say,
from the Arab area and another
from South-east Asia would be
sufficient to convince the
potential buyer that what we
were offering was actual
Moslem-killed meat.
I further suggest that,
initially, cast-for-age ewes and
wethers should be killed, as
these at any advanced age in
fair condition would be better
than the best local sheep af
present available in these
countries. Especially when it is
remembered that most of the
meat is used for curries, quality
is not the first consideration.
After the successful intro-
duction of mutton in this
manner, it would be found that
a very substantial market,
bigger than our own, would
present itself for best-quality
mutton, and I venture the
opinion that within five years
there would not be sufficient
sheep available in Australia to
supply the demand.
The armed forces of these
countries must be considered
as huge potential buyers of
Moslem-killed meat, including
vast quantities of tinned meat.
Again, of course, the first
requirement for this trade
would be that the meat was
actually killed by a Moslem,
preferably with a mullah
present. It would be reason-
able to assume that these
armed forces will be in
existence for many decades
ahead. Even if international
warfare is outlawed, these
countries will need their forces
for internal security and —-
perhaps more important—for
administration.
It is well known that the
majority of sheepfarmers in
the U.S.A. draw the greater
part of their income from
mutton, not from wool, and
that they have deliberately
fostered this factor. In view of
the shrinking wool-market,
Australia will probably have
to give some thought to this
aspect. The higher counts and
good-yielding wool wffl always
command high and satisfactory
prices, but not lower


counts and yields, and in this
field of meat-production lies
the future, probably, of a
great part of the sheep-industry
in Australia.
Geographically (this is my
own opinion) Australia can be
classed as an Asian country.
Therefore, the creation of good-
will with our neighbors should
be of concern to us. The
average meat-consumption per
head of population in these
various countries is, at present,
less than 2oz. a week ; yet the
great need in their fight against
disease is higher nutrition,
which means more fat and
protein in their diet.
Mutton can supply both
those requirements, so I sug-
gest that, instead of spending
millions of pounds under the
Colombo Plan on technical
agricultural equipment, it
would be more beneficial to
the ordinary people of these
countries (90 per cent, of
whom are illiterate) if we give
them the opportunity of buying
good meat at prices far below
what they would have to pay
in their own country, even
assuming that they could pro-
cure it.
It can be readily understood
that filling an empty tummy
with some solid tucker can
create goodwill in immeasur-
able quantities—a factor which
our Government and those in
charge of the Colombo Plan
might well appreciate.
Consideration should be
given, in this connection, to the
fact that in . these countries,
generally speaking, expecta-
tion of life for both males and
females is about thirty years.
Malnutrition, and even starva-
tion are largely responsible for
ihis, plus the fact that virus,
bacterial and parasitical
diseases have a very high
incidence. The resistance of
the people is lowered to a
dangerous level, mainly be-
cause of the low calorific intake
available in their diet. If this
could be raised by the intro-
duction of more protein, in
which meat is so rich, people
of all classes would benefit.
Lack of energy is another
limiting factor in the progress
of these countries, again caused
largely by a low calorific diet,
which is about half that of
Australian white - collar
workers. The benefit to these
people of a richer diet would
be incalculable, and this would
earn us real and lasting feel-
ings of warmth and good-
fellowship.
Moree (N.S.W.) appears an
ideal location for a proposed
Moslem slaughterhouse. This
town is the centre of a large
sheep-breeding area, where it
is estimated that annually
within a radius of 120 miles
(including 60 miles over the
border into south-west Queens-
land) at least 250,000 sheep
reach eight years of age. At
present this number of sheep
die within one or two years,
thus becoming a loss both to
Australia and to the meat-
hungry Asians.
If the scheme were to be
adopted, carcasses could be
transported to Brisbane in
“Ar, let her go — We're back in town, anyway!"
modern refrigerated trucks,
and thence shipped to the
various countries where
facilities for marketing these
sheep already exist. A
minimum of refrigerated space
would be required for storage,
because as fast as the ship was
unloaded the meat could be
disposed of to willing pur-
chasers.
Most of these countries have
sufficient foreign exchange
available to enable them to
purchase substantial quantities,
and for those countries without
foreign exchange —India and
Pakistan, for instance sub-
stantial quantities of mutton
could be supplied from the
profits made in selling to the
countries able to purchase,
under an allocation made from
the Colombo Plan, to finance
“gift-mutton.”
Finally, it is suggested that
this scheme should be initiated
and controlled by the graziers
themselves on a co-operative
basis. The Federal Govern-
ment could be asked to make
a loan available to assist its
implementation, but the
graziers should show their
independence by subscribing to
and making a united effort.
Before anything is done in
this matter, though, a com-
petent, authoritative investigat-
ing-committee should be set
up to examine this proposal,
and to recommend either
acceptance or rejection of the
scheme.
Cape Gooseberry
“Myall”: The Cape Goose-
berry (Physalis Peruviana
edulis) is easy to grow in all
but the coldest parts of the
Commonwealth. This hardy
bush produces crops of small,
round fruit which can be eaten
raw or made into jams or pre-
serves.
Once established, the plant
needs little attention. Prune it
back close to the main stem
when fruiting is finished and
it will send up a good growth
of new wood and produce a
bigger crop than the previous
one.
It grows well on most soils,
but a deeply-dug rich loam
suits it best. Seed sown early
in spring will produce plants
fruiting about February and
bearing well into the winter.
The plants should be raised in
a seed-box and, when large
enough, set-out in rows, about
3ft. apart each way in an open,
sunny position with good
drainage. When they are a few
inches high, pinch out the
leaders in the principal growths
to induce the plants to form
well-shaped bushes.
As the fruit matures, its
husks turn yellow and eventu-
ally fall to the ground.
Collected and husked, they are
ready for use.
Reducing Fencing
Costs
TPhe Massey Agricultural
College runs 800 ewes,
550 dry sheep and 200 cattle
on a 1900-acre property in
steep and broken country in
the Hawkes Bay (N.Z.) dis-
trict, where scrub and danih-
onia are the main vegetation.
There are three types of
fence, erected along lines
which have been bulldozed.
The first is the common rigid
New Zealand fence of eight
wires, posts 13ft. apart with
five wooden droppers between.
The second type, the resilient
Hunter fence, has “foots”-
anchors and chains to hold the
fence down in place of the
heavy posts used in the com-
mon fence, and for droppers
has chains with the patent
spring-clips now available in
Australia. The third type,
“born of necessity and in no
way comparable with those in
more prosperous districts,” is
an all-electric fence.
This electric fence consists
of 2} miles of four wires, kept
up with Waratah steel posts
punched differently from our
Australian ones (more suit-
able for British breeds and
crossbred sheep) and held
down by “foots.” The posts
and foots, which are buried
anchors, are spaced as widely
as practicable. The bottom
wire, 4in. above the ground, is
an earth-wire and acts as a
check to lambs. The first live-
wire is 4in. above the earth-
wire, and there are Bin. and

giving a top-wire height of
27iin. All wires are 12ig.
H.T. Many forms of insulator

supplied by a self-contained
wind-charger, controller and

The objections to electric
fencing which are occasionally
raised by Australian graziers—
difficulty of training sheep to
respect the “flimsy affairs,”
control of growth up to the
wires to prevent shorting, and
the problem of getting stock
through gate openings—seem
to have been effectively dis-
posed of by the Maorilanders.
Chemical spraying with non-
corrosive and safe materials
controls the growth and costs
£25 a mile each year. These
costs are expected to fall
rapidly when new and promis-
ing materials. have been
proved. Gateways in electric
fences are winged with a chain
of non-electrified netting on
the approaches, with the cir-
cuit carried overhead on poles.
They cost about £l2 more
than conventional gateways.
Total costs for a mile with-
out gates are: ordinary fence
£966 (erection at £3 15s. a
chain); Hunter fence £655
(erection at £3 15s. a chain);
“College” electric fence £167
(erection at 63. lOd. a chain).
Spraying, even at £25 a mile
a year, could be done for 20
years before capital-costs
would approximate those of
the Hunter fence; the College
claims that the fences are
stockproof.
Replicas of the College fence,
but with five wires, have been
erected by a grazier at a cost
of £155 a mile for three
miles (without gates) and have
efficiently contained mobs of
several thousand sheep on
crop.
Can these techniques be
applied in similar conditions in
Australia? There are huge
acreages of rough hill-country
skirting our Great Dividing
Range in the eastern States,
which are being improved at
a spectacular rate by aircraft.
It may not be long before con-
ventional-fencing costs will
stifle full use of the increased
carrying-capacity, just as hap-
pened eight years ago in New
Zealand. There is much to be
said for killing growth along
fence-lines —weeds are kept in
check along their main arteries
for spreading. And bare fence-
lines could easily eliminate
ploughed fire-breaks in diffi-
cult country.
It must be remembered,
however, that in Australian
conditions, where heavy rain
often falls on parched erodable
ground, there could be dangers.
Further, the cost-advantage of
these electric fences over our
conventional fences might not
be so marked. Still, the
potential benefit of applying
these New Zealand economies
to our conditions is worth
attention and trial.

Bean-fly
“North”: In warm weather
French beans are often
attacked by the bean-fly
(Agromyza phaseoli), a shining
black insect, about |in. long,
which can often be noticed rest-
ing on the leaves of the plants.
The female fly punctures the
upper surfaces of the leaves,
usually towards the stalk-end,
and lays its eggs. These
punctures show as yellowish
spots on the leaves and are a
sure indication that the fly is
active.
In summer the eggs hatch-
out in about four days and the
larvae begin mining through
the leaf-stalk to the stem,
where they feed for about nine
days before pupating. During
this time the damage is done—
the inside of the stalk is often
eaten completely away and the
plant falls over and quickly
dies.
This pest can be controlled
by spraying with D.D.T. at
0.1 per cent, strength. Begin
spraying the third day after the
plants appear above the surface,
and make a second application
four days later. Third and
fourth sprayings should be
given at weekly intervals. If
D.D.T. dust is substituted for
the spray make dustings at four-
day intervals. Only the surface
of the leaves need be sprayed ;
use 30gal. to 90gal. to treat an
acre. Should continuous rain
fall, the crop should be re-
sprayed as soon as the weather
fines-up again.
Hill-up the plants when
they are a few inches high to
encourage the growth of
secondary roots from the stem.
These will help considerably
should the plants be attacked.
Silage
“Windy”: It does “take
brains to pickle grass” (B.
10/12/’5B). By all means “go
like blazes, cut, cart and con-
solidate,” as “K.G.S.” suggests,
but there's more to it than that.
The best silage is made from
green leafy crops or grass en-
siled at about 98 deg. F.
Temperature-control is vital ; if
the temperature of the mass is
too low the silage will be slushy
and sour, while if the material
heats-up too much it will lack
the palatable taste of well-
made ensilage.

In Queensland the Peninsula and north-west and south-
west areas should receive heavy rains in January, with good
rains on the south coast district and Darling Downs. The
rest of the State can expect only patchy rainfall with heavy
rains and flooding in February and March.
Rainfall may be patchy in N.S.W. during January, apart
from moderate to good rains on the coast and tablelands
and on the north-west slopes and plains areas. Good general
rains should occur in February, becoming patchy and below
normal during the autumn.
The southern divisions of Victoria should receive good
rains in January, varying from light to moderate in the
Mallee and northern divisions. Heavy rains are likely in
February and March.
Moderate rain is likely in the agricultural areas of
South Australia during January, but light and patchy else-
where. The agricultural areas and north-west interior should
receive moderate to heavy rains in February, but again
poor elsewhere. The seasonal rains should start in May.
Rainfall in W.A. may be poor in January, apart from
moderate rain in the Kimberleys. The North Kimberleys
should receive good rains in February, but rainfall may
again be poor elsewhere in the State.

of how the pit is heating by
wriggling your arm down into
the green mass. If it’s too hot
there’s too much oxygen in
the material and it needs more
rolling and pressing to get it
out. On the other hand, if the
mass feels cool and clammy,
you are wasting time and fuel
consolidating so much. Get on
with the job of cutting and
carting.
Another way of telling how
things are panning-out is to
drive a crowbar into the silage,
pull it out and feel how hot
the bar has become.
Temperature becomes very
important with unusual crops.
While the quality of silage is
determined in the first place
by the material used, you can
still make excellent silage from
grass or crops past their prime,
but this is where you have to
vary your method from that
advocated by “K.G.S.”
The moisture-content of
matured plants is lower than
that of plants in the very green
stage, so it’s necessary to
water the material while pack-
ing it into the pit or trench.
It is impossible to estimate
how much water is needed for
each load or ton. Keep an eye
on the temperature of the pit.
If too much water has been
added, more rolling and press-
ing will be needed, but if by
luck the right amount his been
used, time and money can be
saved on needless rolling and
pressing.
Experience will soon tell how
different crops behave. But
temperature-checks aren’t just
“tosh” ; they make all the
difference between first-quality
silage and sour, slushy or
burnt and charred ensilage—
which reacts through the milk-
or cream-cheque.
Distichum
“Pea Jay”: Farming in
southern Queensland many
years ago, I had samples of
different Victorian grasses sent
me from Gippsland and the
northern division. Only straw-
berry-clover and Paspalum
distichum survived the trip, and
I was disappointed when dis-
tichum turned-out to be water-
couch, of which we already
had plenty in the district.
Years later, while dairying
on the Dawson River in
Central Queensland, I planted
distichum on the banks of
lagoons and swamps, but it
thrived best on the acres of
melonhole country which was
my heaviest carrying country —
a paddock of 170 acres carried
300 head of stock for months.
When those melonholes filled
after the first heavy rains, it
was only a matter of days
before the first shoots showed
above the water. In a few
weeks it looked like a wheat-
field.
As “Splodger” says (B.
26/11/’5B), it will come
through 4ft. of water and
there’s still plenty of feed after
the holes have dried again.
I saw patches come up as
good as ever ’after kangaroos
had clawed and dug-out what
I thought to be all the roots in
a drought.
This is how we established
distichum. The country was
brigalow and wilga ; after
being ringbarkecj, for at least
four years we fired it and sowed
it to Rhodes-grass. The heavy
rains filled the melonholes with
water, killing the Rhodes-grass
in the low parts. We then got
armsful of water-couch from
a fenced-off nursery-patch, put
it on the saddle and simply
threw a couple of stems into
each hole as we rode, two- or
three-abreast, back and forth
over the paddock.
Para-grass had to be dibbled-
in or pressed with a forked
stick into the soft-ground, but
distichum is much easier to
grow and will stand far more
punishment than any other
grass. There is only one draw-
back: being a paspalum it is
subject periodically to ergot.
Our stock did not seem to
suffer any ill-effects on that
account, however, and its feed-
value outweighs that disad-
vantage many times over. In
my opinion it was the best grass
on The Dawson for that
particular country.
Liquid Fertilisers
“Big Billy”: Liquid
manures and fertilisers, the
best means of supplying plant-
foods during rapid summer
growth, are simply prepared
by soaking any animal manure
in water. A kero.-tin of fowl-
manure placed in a bag and
immersed in a 44gal. drum of
water for a week will make a
good start. This should then
be diluted in four to eight times
its own volume of water.
‘Liquid manure is particularly
valuable for rhubarb, celery
and other broad-leaved plants,
but it’s good for all vegetables
and other crops, too. Water it
in liberally around the plants,
but keep the liquid off the
leaves as far as possible.
Several liquid fertilisers are
on the market, and, although
fairly expensive even for
market - garden requirements;
their advantage is that they
make plant-foods immediately
available to plant-roots.
Using Weedkillers
“Sundowner”: With weed-
killers make sure to use the
right material in the right way
at the right time.
Poor results are often due
to wind causing a drift of
spray or to rain washing the
spray off before it has been
absorbed by the plant. Effects
of rain are least with 2,4-D and
2.4.5-testers.
Temperature is another im-
portant factor with hormone
weedkillers. All things being
equal, higher temperatures
increase the speed with which
the weedkiller takes effect.
Experiments suggest that when
spraying is done in warm con-
ditions the result is better
whether or not the temperature
drops after spraying.
Temperature is particularly
important when spraying with
D.N.P.B. in peas, lucerne or
similar crops. In cool weather
(round 55 deg. F.) 21b. of active
material to an acre will control
wild-radish fumitory, wirewecd
and fat-hen, but in milder
weather the quantity should be
reduced. At about 70 deg. F.
lib. an acre is enough.
Annuals and biennials be-
come harder to kill as they
approach maturity, but the
importance of stage of growth
varies with species. Once
perennials have become estab-
lished the problem is to kill
their roots. The most elfective
time for treatment varies with
the weed and the type of
weedkiller. Using 2,4-D,
hoary-cress is controlled most
efficiently if sprayed at the
beginning of flowering, while
skeleton-weed is best sprayed
in the late rosette-stage, just
before the flowering stem
appears.
Spraying is also more
effective while the weeds are
growing well. The soil should
be moist but not waterlogged,
and high fertility favors
effective control.

Information Sought
(1) Simple home-method of mak-
ing wine from grapes? (2) What
is the legal position regarding the
making of wine for home-
consumption ?
(1) Gather fruit when quite dry
and ripe, place in wooden or enamel
tub' and crush well with a wooden
mallet or masher; cover crushed
pulp with boiling water, throw a
cloth over it and let stand one to
three weeks, then strain-off the
liquor. To every gallon allow 31b.
sugar, stir well together, and let
ferment in a tub or cask with the
bung out. Let it work for 10 days,
filling cask with some of the
liquor which should have been kept
out for that purpose. When fer-
menting has stopped, add loz.
isinglass and £lb. raisins to every
9gals., and leave for about six
months before bottling (it improves
with keeping). A little whisky or
brandy may be added if liked.
There are several ■ processes, but
this one is suitable for home-
workers.
(2) The law is very strict on the
making of alcoholic drinks. Those
made must contain not more than
2 per cent, alcohol, and this is
difficult for the amateur to assess.
To be on the safe side, a small
quantity should be made from
time to time for home use only;
any attempt at selling these wines
—or beers —is likely to bring a
heavy fine. To clear-up any uncer-
tainties, consult your local police
department.

Information on fihe habits of
hermit-crabs ?
Hermit-crab's carry empty mollusc-
shells to protect their soft, fleshy
tails; when the crab grows too
large for its shell it changes to a
bigger one. Sometimes the larger
shell may be already occupied by
another crab, in which case there
is a fight, with the crabs trying to
“You need a level head for this sort of thing”
pull each other out. A hermit-
crab has even been observed throw-
ing sand into its rival’s shell in an
effort to dislodge it. These crabs
are found in sea-water from the
shallowest tide-pools to extremely
deep regions. Some carry a stone
or burrow into pieces of rock to
protect the soft tail, and use one
claw as a kind of doorstep at its
entrance. One kind ( Ccenobita )
crawls about on land, and, like its
cousin the coconut-crab (Birgus
latro), will drown if kept in sea-
water. Hermit-crabs are car-
nivorous scavengers, feeding on any
animal-matter, even starfishes. They
lay eggs, which are carried on
appendages along the soft tail. The
newly-hatched hermit-crab goes
through a metamorphosis, at one-
stage having a symmetrical tail
rather like a prawn’s.

Recipe for cooking eggfruit ?
Wipe or wash eggfruit, put into
fireproof dish with a little water,
cover with greased paper and bake
in moderate oven till tender, then
cut open and mash with butter,
pepper and salt. Alternatively, cut
in halves lengthwise, scoop out
seeds, sprinkle salt in thickly and
leave, cut-side up, for one hour.
Make a stuffing (as for duck or
turkey), fill fruit-halves, piling high,
strew crumbs over, dot with butter
and bake in greased baking-dish
for. one hour in moderate oven.
Fruit may also ,b'e curried. To fry,
cut into slices, peel and drop into
boiling, salted water. Leave one
hour, roll in egg or flour or crumbs
and fry in deep fat.

Details of the Rodney disaster ?
On February 13, 1938, the double-
decker pleasure - ferry Rodney,
carrying between 85 and 150 pas-
sengers who were farewelling a
U.S. cruiser, capsized and sank near
Bradley’s Head, Port Jackson,
Sydney. Women and girls pre-
dominated among the passengers,
most of whom were on the upper
deck. As she rounded the stern
of the cruiser they rushed to the
starboard side of the ferry, causing
it to list badly. The list' was
accentuated by the turning of. the
helm and the wash of the cruiser,
and the craft capsized within a
few minutes. In all, 19 persons
were drowned and 64 treated for
shock and immersion. A verdict of
accidental death was returned by
the coroner at an inquiry held. on
March 10, 1938,. and the master
of the Rodney was found not guilty
of criminal negligence. At a later
inquiry held by the Marine Board
the master’s certificate was sus-
pended. The Rodney was subse-
quently raised and put back into
service.
(1) Who introduced paspalum ?
(2) Where does it mainly occur, and
what is its nutritive value ?
(1) It was introduced into Aus-
tralia from South America by
Ferdinand von Mueller in 1891.
An ounce of seed which he sent
to the Director of Agriculture in
N.S.W. was divided between dairy-
farmers at Wollongbar and along
the Richmond River, on the North
Coast, and from this beginning the
grass spread very widely. For some
years it was a poor seeder and was
usually propagated by roots, but
as it became acclimatised it began
to grow well from seed also.
(2) It is the dominant grass in
the dairying pastures of the nor-
thern rivers of N.S.W. and on
parts of the southern tablelands of
Queensland. It also occurs in many
other areas where there is enough
summer rain to give it a chance
of effective growth. In irrigation-
areas on the Murray it is one of
the most important grasses in pro-
viding perennial pastures. As a
grazing plant it is valuable when
correctly managed. Its nutritive
value varies with the stages of
growth; the leaves and young stems
are moderately nutritious, but the
old dry stems are only a low-quality
rcughage. There is some trade in
its seed —paspalum-seed for export
is collected on the North Coast of
N.S.W.

wife (a widow, Mrs. Johnston, who
nevertheless brought books into
their home and encouraged
Abraham to read). He had a brief
period at school in 1818, just after
his mother’s death; again a couple
of years later, when he learned to
read, write and spell, and again in
1826 for a short while. His total
schooling lasted less than 12
months.

Brief Answers
J.C.S.: In August, 1946, when the
Government’s Rural Electricity Sub-
sidy Scheme was introduced, the
eligible capital cost for subsidy
determination purposes was based
on a limit of £250 of capital cost
per consumer. During 1953 this
limit was progressively increased
from £250 to the new limit of £4OO.
In May, 1953, the limit became
£260 and was thence increased by
increments of £2O per month until
the maximum of £4OO was reached
in December, 1953. Subsidy for
extensions begun during the months
of May to December, 1953, was
based on the relevant subsidy limit.
Thus, in December, 1953, the new
limit of £4OO became effective. All
subsidies approved from 1946 until
June 30, 1955, are paid over a
period of 10 years in diminishing
annual payments. Subsidies
approved on and from July 1, 1955,
are paid over a period of 15 years
in equal annual instalments. Under
the new method of subsidy pay-
ments, the aggregate subsidy payable
for an extension has been increased
by about 20 per cent., compared
with the original 10-year method of
payments N.H.L.: Write to the

Women's Letters
SYDNEY
The year 1959 arrived very quietly in
Sydney. Though the moon was shining
and the air fresh and still at midnight,
there was a very small crowd at the
spaceport to welcome her, for the Old
Year before departing had rather spite-
fully sent down a steady, discouraging
drizzle of rain which drove most of the
merrymakers away, and left the TV
stations nothing to televise. But they put
on party-caps and called-in some
songsters and did their best.
All except Channel 2 (ABN), which
had been showing a clever but depressing
satire called “Wild Life in the Suburbs”
and did not mention the New Year until
seven minutes past 12, when it closed-
down and wished one and all a happy
New Year.
So poor little 1959 entered unnoticed.
Perhaps it will have a quiet disposition,
made diffident because for the past 10
years all the predictions of great things
to come begin: “By 1960 we will have
this,” “By 1960 we will have done that,”
“By 1960 the populations will have . . ~”
etc., etc. But 1959 was never quoted as
a target for achievement. No wonder it
sits so quietly in the corner.
Looking back over 1958, one recalls
first and foremost the visit of the Queen
Mother. Then the many interesting
theatrical personalities come to mind;
Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis
Casson, Roger Livesey and Ursula Jeans,
Margaret Rutherford and Emlyn
Williams. There was the visit of the New
York Ballet and later the Royal Ballet,
and the personalities of Dame Ninette
de Valois and Robert Helpmann. English
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and
Lady Dorothy won our hearts, and
Russian violinist David Oistrakh brought
packed houses at £2 2s. a seat.
Fashion grew more lively during 1958,
for the sack, un-beautiful as it was in
itself, stimulated the adventurous to
achieving a new look. So the girl of
1958 with her bouffant hair-do, large
dark eyes and pale lips, her dangling
beads and ear-rings, waistless dresses,
colored stockings, pointed shoes, her
harem - skirts, pumpkin - skirts and
headache-bands was really something
distinctive—a living picture, strange but
true.
In cosmetics “royal jelly” was the
catchword. It appeared in advertise-
ments for so many things one began to
wonder whether there would be enough
queen bees in the world to provide it.
The fashion-world really seemed to set
its compass for Australia during 1958.
The German fashions made quite a hit
with their short skirts and flower-pot
hats. Then the Queen’s dressmaker,
Norman Hartnell, sent his envoys ahead
and later arrived himself to show some
lavish evening-dresses. Then Ferragamo,
shoemaker de luxe, came to “look us
over,” and the milliners formed an
association to convince us that we don’t
look well-dressed without a hat.
In medicine the “low virus” was the
fashion. The previous year we had had
Asian ’flu. But last year it was the “low
virus” and very low indeed it was.
The city itself began to take on a new
aspect, mainly because of the huge glass-
houses which have risen at various
points, and also because the overhead
roadway to the Bridge has given us a new
perspective of the city.
But the private houses have not shown
much improvement. Everywhere there
are rows of houses shabby and depressed
because the tenants won’t care for them
(they think the landlord should) and the
landlord won’t do it because he is getting
such a low return for them. The Land-
lord and Tenant Act hath them in thrall.
But on the whole the life of the city
is healthy and vigorous, and if the new-
comer 1959 doesn’t bring any momentous
change itself, then it will at least be useful
in preparing the way for this wonderful
1960 we have heard so much about.
Sister Beth Forrest, of the Australian
Inland Mission, home on furlough with
her parents, Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Forrest,
of Hurls tone Park, has an interesting
story to tell of life in the uranium town
of Mary Kathleen (Q.), where she has
been stationed for the past 18 months.
The town itself is very pretty, she reports,
as it has been carefully planned and laid-
out with all the houses painted in varied
pastel colors, and lawns, shrubs and
trees planted everywhere. Everyone has
a garden, and there is a strong garden-
club with frequent contests. Water, which
is used to the extent of a million gallons
a day, comes from the dam, but some-
times the rainmakers of the C.S.T.R.O.
are called in, and sometimes, in summer,
there are restrictions. (Just like Sydney !)
“The climate is not really . too hot,”
says Sister Forrest seriously. “It never
went over 112 degrees when I was there.”
But, then, Sister Forrest has worked for
the A. J. M. at Birdsville and Ooanadatta,
where the temperature is often 118 deg.
Work at these two outposts was, however,
not so strenuous as that at Mary Kath-
leen, where the four-bed hospital is run
by a resident doctor and two nurses. It
is only 40 miles from Cloncurry and'
Mt. Isa, and an air-taxi service “zooms
off in all directions” at a moment’s notice.
It is an interesting and. different life that
is led in these inland Australian towns,
where the heat does not worry you and
“the bush gets under your skin.” Sister
Forrest’s photograph is by Norton
Trev aire.
One change that 1958 brought about
was a reversal of attitude towards the
Australian accent and way of speaking.
People are beginning to be rather proud
of being “a weird mob,” and, indeed,
rather inclined to stress the Austra-
lianisms. f ‘My very word” is the latest
catchphrase and rivals the Americanism
“That’s foR sure” for top rating, as they
say. Even the Education Department,
during 1958, issued instructions that in
the teaching of English more emphasis
should be placed on expressiveness than
on vowel-sounds, and there is, on the
whole, a general- feeling that Australian
speech is not so deplorable after all.

“Colomba”: A wildflower woman is
painting away for dear life at Caloundra
(Qld.).. Her studio looks over the sea
to the high yellow sandhills of Moreton
Island ; through the windows push sprays
of the burgundy hibiscus and the beach-
bean from the garden of native plants
outside. Banksias and sheoaks emerge
from rampaging red grevilleas and
Murray - lilies (alias Darling - lilies or
Brisbane - lilies) which flourish in the
seaweed-enriched soil. A tall bloodwood,
feasting-place of honeyeaters, shakes its
blossoms on the roof.
The studio walls are covered with
Kathleen McArthur’s wildflower paint-
ings. She has completed over 400,
botanically correct and vetted by the
Queensland Government Botanist. Seven
years ~ago her children had to show her
how to mix her colors. On wide tables
in the studio are reproductions of some
of the paintings, the sales of which will
eventually finance a book of Queensland
wildflowers, richly adorned with color-
plates.
Kathleen McArthur’s color-prints are
steadily being sought throughout Aus-
tralia, and with them always goes her
plea for preservation of our native flora,
a subject as dear to her as her painting.
Her prints hang in Queensland House,
London, and Qantas this month is show-
ing them in its New York office and then

MELBOURNE
Twelfth Night has come and gone,
taking with it the gaily - decorated
Christmas-cards, the tinsel and glitter
which made homes gay and festive, and
the sound of the lovely old carols has
faded away. The cards this year were
most attractive, and many were of a
personal nature.
The Governor and Lady Brooks..sent-
out cards which enclosed a picture, in
color, of themselves, their son-in-law and
daughter (Mr. and Mrs. Robin Byrne)
and their two children, Christopher and
Jennifer. The group was taken in the
garden of Government House and was
titled “Our family re-union, 1958.” From
the Premier and Mrs. Bolte came a card
which featured in glowing replica pink
heath, a flower which has become the
State’s national emblem. The card
chosen by the Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress (Cr. and Mrs. F. W. Thomas)
featured the City’s crest and the stage-
setting, in color, of the wonderful scene
used at the Town Hall reception to the
Queen Mother. Also in color was the
group of choir-boys which was the per-
sonal card of Sir Frank and Lady
Selleck.
Many cards featured lovely bush-
scenes, and one of the loveliest was the
card Lady Disney sent to her friends.
The emblem of Thailand was the motif
on the simple card sent by the Consul
for Thailand (Mr. H. I. Fader) and Mrs.
Fader. And from Edinburgh came a
greeting-card from Dame Sybil Thorn-
dike and Sir Lewis Casson on which
Dame Sybil.had written, “We are missing
Australia very much and would love to
be back again.”

Among prominent women of this city
honored by the Queen in the New Year
List for their work in the community is
Mrs. Henry Bolte, wife of the Premier,
who received the C.B.E. Mrs. Bolte has
a deep interest in a variety of activities,
including the Girl Guide Movement, of
which she is a member of the State
Executive, and was until recently a
District Commissioner. She also actively
supports organisations connected with
the welfare of women and children—she
is chairman of the Yooralla Hospital
School for Crippled Children Appeal.
Mrs. Bolte also played an active part in
the recent successful Cancer Appeal. In
April Mrs. Bolte will accompany the
Premier on a trip overseas.
Mrs. J. C. Scantlebury, who was
awarded an 0.8. E., has been since 1951 a
vice-chairman of the Australian Red
Cross Society, for which she has worked
since the 1914-1918 war, when, with
Lady White, she conducted a prisoner-
of-war inquiry-bureau in London. For
some years she w&s a member of the
council of the Victorian division, and
represented the society at the 1957 world
conference in India.
Another recipient of the 0.8. E. is Dr.
Janet Cooper, who last year became the
first woman mayor of South Melbourne.
Among her many interests, apart from
her busy practice, are the Claremont
Home for the Aged (she is on the board-
of-management), she is an executive mem-
ber for the Victorian Baby Health
Centres, and of the Playgrounds and Re-
creation Association; a patron of the
Savoy auxiliary for mentally retarded
children at Kew ;■ president of the Mel-
bourne Business and Professional
Women’s Club ; a member of the Pen-
guin Club; a past-president of the Ladies’
Benevolent Association ; a member of the
South Melbourne Maternal and Child
Welfare Association ; and she is on the
board-of-management of the Gladswood
Home for the Aged at Essendon.
Lady Tait, wife of Sir Frank Tait
(managing-director "of J. C. Williamson ),
and mother of school-age daughters Isla.
Anne and Sally, is busy organising two
gala-performances of “My Fair Lady,”
to take place on Feb. 2 and 3, and which
will benefit the Royal Children’s Hospital,
Royal Women’s Hospital, the Yooralla
Crippled Children's Hospital and the
National Trust. She is also head of a
large committee which annually stages a
Mother’s Day concert for the Royal
Women’s Hospital. Lady Tait, a titian-
haired Scot, came to Australia as Viola
Wilson to sing leading roles in Gilbert-
and-Sullivan operas. John Warlow photo.
During the holidays there was a con-
stant stream of visitors from the south to
the lovely Vaucluse (Sydney) home of
Mrs. Humbert Pugliese. They called to
offer their good wishes and congratula-
tions on her recovery from injuries
received in a plane crash in Paris, and
there was another cause for felicitations,
for round about the middle of the year,
Mrs. Pugliese will marry Sydney business-
man Albert Bryk at St. Mark’s, Darling
Point. House-guests at Vaucluse were
Mr. and Mrs. Jack Wagstaff, their
daughters Carole, Sandra and Rhonda
and their son John, and David Lee. Mr.
and Mrs. Roy Dixon, Mrs. Dorothy Git-
sham, Mrs. A. M. Dawson and Mr.
Norman Watt —all from Melbourne —
were also visitors to this charming home.
One of the largest and gayest New
Year parties was at the Peninsula
Country Golf Club, Frankston, where 450
members and their friends danced the old
year out and 1959 in. The president,
Sir George Coles, and Lady Coles were
there with members of their family, as
were the vice-president, Mr. Bruce.
Henderson, and Mrs. Henderson. The
captain, Dr. Keith Brown, was with Mrs.
Brown. Among the dancers were Dr.
and Mrs. K. McLean, Mr. and Mrs.
Alec Cato, Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Alley,
Dr. and Mrs. Hughes Jones and their
daughter Helen, and Mr. and Mrs. R. J.
Brown and their daughter Helen.

Over the Christmas-New Year period
there was a slowing-up of social life, for
so many were out of town holidaying by
the sea or in the country. Many, of
course, went north for the Davis Cup
challenge roufid. Afnong these were
Mrs. G. R. Nicholas, her daughter
Jennifer, Dr. Kathleen Galbally, and a
friend of Jennifer, Margaret Gurry. This
party came from a seaside holiday at
Broadleaf and will be back home on
January 10. Mrs. E. L. Fitzgerald had
her granddaughter, Susan Daly, with her.
Before coming home Mrs. Fitzgerald will
spend some time with Mr. and Mrs. Eric
Thomas at Point Piper, Sydney.
Diana Learmonth and Plum Ruther-
ford, two of the attractive members of
this city’s younger-set, also went to Bris-
bane, and others were the Walter
Killoughs and visitors from Singapore,
Mr. and Mrs. Phil Guilfoyle, who were
staying at Surfers’ Paradise.

Estelle, youngest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. F. W. Carracun, of East Kew, and
John, youngest son of Mr. and Mrs.
J. R. Simpson, of Canterbury, received
the Papal blessing when they were
married at St. Anne’s Church, East Kew.
The bride wore a gown of pure silk
taffeta, the full skirt falling into soft-
pleated folds and extending into a slight
train. The finger-tip tulle veil was caught
by a coronet of tiny roses, and the
bouquet was of white orchids. Attending
the bride were Marie O’Leary, of
Wangaratta, and her cousin Mary Carra-
cun. They wore Empire-line frocks of
white embroidered linen with aqua-velvet
bows on their hair and long gloves in
the same lovely shade. They carried
water-lilies. The ’groom’s brother
George was best man, and Peter Rasmus-
sen groomsman. Reception was at
Dennis House, Hawthorn.


white girl’s love for an aboriginal
stockman; and, because of his com-
passion and his poetry, makes the
story at once convincing and pro-
foundly moving.
Other stories are concerned, essen-
tially, with the cruelty to animals that
is so inevitable a part of outback life;
and here, again chiefly because of that
vein of wild poetry, Robinson has
avoided the sentimentality that nearly
always mars such stories. The brumby
is shot; the blind calf dies of thirst;
the narrator himself kills the white
rabbit; but all is seen, though .with
compassion, as part of that fierce,
tragic and even beautiful drama of
life in wild places which this part of
the book sets out to depict.
The prose itself is excellent, too.
Possibly it derives from D. H.
Lawrence, but Robinson has made it
his own. It has energy; an odd, power-
ful movement; a rich simplicity.
The second and shorter book is
“The Tales of Percy Mumbulla,” a
collection of the half-legendary
stories which Roland Robinson has
picked-up from the aborigines along
the N. S. Wales South Coast.
The stories give a captivating picture
of the aborigines living in fairyland,
now; lingering on in their camps along
the South Coast, with the old spirits
and demons, sometimes strangely mixed
with newcomers from Christianity,
still alive amongst them.
Using modern placenames and set
in modern times —“At last Bertie
can’t go on. He can’t stand the strain
any longer. He says to old Jimmy,
‘lt’s no use, old-man, this power is
too strong for me’....01d Jimmy
went away out west to Canberra. It
was the time of the visit of the Duke
of Gloucester” —the tales have an
extraordinary effect of immediacy and
conviction. It is like white people
sitting around and telling ghost-
stories; and if anything can light-up
the countryside for the white man with
the folklore of the aborigines, it is
these stories, in their immediacy, that
could do it.
The myths collected by scientists
tend to remain remote; the average
attempts by writers for children to
re-tell or invent aboriginal legends are
too often sentimental or unreal: these
are alive. Ultimately, no doubt, it is
the living language in which the stories
are told, more than their immediacy of
place and time, that makes them so
vivid. Whether Roland Robinson has
simply noted them down as they were
told to him, or whether he has in part
used his own artistry to recreate them,
he has certainly found the perfect way
to tell them. In theme they are a bit
repetitive; but each story has enough
surprises of incident or charm of
language and cadence to keep the
short book interesting.
Detective Novels
In The Development of the Detective
Novel (Peter Owen) Mrs. A. E. Murch
begins with Robin Hood, medieval jest-
books recounting frauds, the picaresque
novel, the “Newgate , Calendar,”
Defoe’s “Roxana,” the Frenchman
Mailly’s “Adventures of the Three
Princes of Serendip,” which goes back
to the Arabian Nights and forward to
Voltaire’s “Zadig” and anticipated the
system of deduction for which Sherlock
Holmes is most famous.
In the 1790’s Mrs. Radcliffe grafted
on to the terror-tale like Horace Wal-
pole’s “Castle of Otranto” (1764)-“a
reasonably rational explanation of
the enigmas created in her ingenious
plots”; and William Godwin, in his
“Caleb Williams” (1794), was perhaps
fehe first to write the final volume first
(they were three-decker novels in those
days) and work back towards the begin-
ning—the method, if not the practice,
of the modern detective-story.
Lord Lytton wrote seven crime-
novels; in America, James Fenimore
Cooper made deduction popular in the
forest trailing of his redskins; and in
1828 the “Memoirs of Vidocq,” French
criminal-turned-detective, Chef de la
Surete, 1811-27, 1831-43,
gave the general public in his own
country apd abroad a very clear
conception of the “ideal detective,”
and it was from him that many later
detectives of fiction inherited....
great physical strength, patience and
endurance ; skill in disguise and an
insight into criminal mentality ; their
reputation for inevitable success and
their moments of dramatic personal
triumph. “I am Vidocq!”.... echoed
down the years to become “I am
Hawkshaw the detective!” in “The
Ticket of Leave Man”... .Another
legacy from Vidocq is the general
assumption that the regular police
are inept, inefficient and resentful of
the gifted amateur.
Balzac used Vidocq. Eugene Sue,
expert in crime and prisons, was first
to consider that “certain types of
criminals . characteristically commit
only certain types of crimes.”
One particularises these names and
dates because they were all before 1841,
when, with “The Murders' in the Rue
Morgue,” Poe threw his hat into the
ring, and with five short tales set the
pattern for the categories of: “sensa-
tional crime” (“Rue Morgue”); “arm-
chair deduction” (“Marie Roget”);
“secret-agent, missing document, scan-
dal, blackmail, beautiful lady” (“Pur-
loined Letter”); “solution by crypto-
gram” (“Gold Bug”); and “unmasking
secret crime of respected citizen”
(“Thou Art the Man”).
Dickens made an essay in deduction
from secondhand clothing in “Sketches
by Boz,” in 1834; was hauled over the
coals by none less than Poe for mis-
handling the mystery plot of “Barnaby
Rudge” in 1841; and in 1852-53 made a
best-seller- of the detective theme of
“Bleak House.” Wilkie Collins, deriv-
ing from Poe and the French crime-
FATHER AND SON
The tall wheels grate into the miles
The jinker takes to Cherokee.
I sit perched on a stumble; he
Pretends a song, or quaintly smiles;
Our minds, unmeeting, still agree
To mark each other’s loving wiles.
Of the same bone and temperament,
We differ in the powers spent
To come to this wrenching peace again:
Two small, self-wounding, fearful men
Riding on rock, on flint, on knives,
Who travel from their camping lives.
What shall I speak of ? The bland earth ?
Question a dog’s or kinsman’s worth ?
If mind falters in what I say,
Love cannot guard the entered way:
“It’s black Orangemen own these farms,
Crushing'us with their pious arms.”
“Ah, they’re no worse than ever our own,
Who’d strip you to the shuddering bone
And then use that to fertilise
The sullen land beyond that rise,
Making their life a bloody war.
You’re better out of it where you are.
1 curse the day I saw this place.”
The spokes are webbed with light; I face
Patiently such words as these
And wait, preparing words of ease,
But fail: “Ah, we’re a spendthrift lot.”
The soft hair growing coarse, the hot
Veins beating in the Irish head,
And the limbs terrified of death?
“And yet with a quick meanness, too.
To hoard a pound and still undo
All that we had thought was ours.”
Self-pity could go on for hours.
We meet only in silence, stress
Each other with our separateness.
Yes, I can glimpse in what we say
Our impotence in this modern day,
The love of everything contrary
Our family motto still preserves,
NEC TIMIDE NEC TEMERE,
Meaning: Do everything by halves,
Half-patient, then half-passionate,
Half-soundly loving while we hate,
And, even while the ploughshare steers,
Nothing’s completely in control.
“Still, they were sort of pioneers.”
Broke land, at least, and backs, at least;
I thought to pioneer a soul,
Your soul and mine, from the wretched
past
Brought to a common pitch at last.
And, “Summer will be bad, I think.”
“Well, what we need is a bloody drink.”
Uncertain gesturings that track
The five common miles, and back.

A BOOK FOR KIDS
by C. J, Dennis
Here is tlie Book for Kids again—and its stories are as fresh as when, 37 years ago,
they were first presented. “All good children over four and under four-and-eighty”
are, in the author's words, the ones he wrote this book for. It's mostly short poems,
nice to say out loud and easy to remember, and a few light-hearted stories, illustrated
with Mr, Dennis’s own friendly drawings. 15/- (post 7d.)
Available from all booksellers and . . .
ANGUS & ROBERTSON LTD.,
89-95 Castlereagh Street, Sydney
writers, had his big successes with “The
Woman in White” (1860) and “The
Moonstone” (1868), while in France
Feval and Ponson led up to the first of
the great French detective-novels,
“L’Affaire Lerouge” (1863), by
Gaboriau , . . and it was a study of
Gaboriau that produced in 1887 in
Melbourne “The Mystery of a Hansom
Cab,” by a bookseller called Fergus
Hume; a “Hansom Cab Publishing
Company” formed in England sold
400,000 copies of it there.
And so to Sherlock Holmes, who first
appeared in “Beeton’s Christmas
Annual” in 1887 (“A Study in Scarlet”),
and the period after World War I,
which Mrs. Murch very properly calls
“The Golden Age” of the detective
story —and which is so crowded with
virtuosi that she isn’t quite able to do
them all justice; not, at any rate, the
copious justice she has done their fore-
runners, with summaries of their plots
and details of their innovations.
Giving high praise to the English
school, she leaves herself no reserve of
full organ-tone, of drums and timpani
with massed choirs and brass bands,
with which to celebrate the Americans:
Van Dine, Gardner, Stout, Chandler
and, far above all, Hammett, with
whom few English authors can com-
pare. As one thinks over the English
list after Conan Doyle only one name
really stands out, but that with a pre-
eminence, come to think of it, that has
something of glory in it; it is astonish-
ing to reread Chesterton and consider
that “The Innocence of Father Brown”
was first printed in 1911 —he has aged
no more than John Donne because his
problems are made of the mysteries of
the spirit and are stated, as Donne’s
were, in words that never seem to lose
their organic life. He, of all detective-
stoiy writers, was entitled to say in
Mrs. Murch’s introduction:—
The first essential of the detective-
story lies in this, that it is the earliest
and only form of popular literature
in which is expressed some sense of
the poetry of modern life.
Mrs. Murch has some kind words for
a short-story, “The Power of the Leaf,”
by the Australian A. E. Martin, and for
his freak-show novel, “The Chinese
Bed Mysteries”; but although she is
interested by the aboriginal motif of
Martin’s short-story, she fails alto-
gether to mention the long series of
detective novels with an Australian
aboriginal detective by Arthur Upfield,
the finest detective-writing ever done in
Australia and as good as all except a
few in the world.
There is a bibliography of books on
the art of the detective-story; another
giving the main novels by post-World
War I writers; and an index.

Peter Cowan Stories
Everyone has a hell of a time in the
thirteen stories of The Unploughed
Land, by Peter Cowan (Angus and
Robertson) —except in the last, the long
title-story, where his characters seem
to rebel against the authority of their
stern author-father: they have a baby
and get married.
A run of short-stories, more than a
novel, brings out the set of an author’s
mind, the governing tone and direction
which informs all the work of any
worth-while writer: and that of Cowan
is well summarised by the title of the
first story: “Isolation.” His characters
are haunted by the ghosts of resent-
ment, timidity and guilt which stultify
action and prevent people coming
together.
In “Isolation” the lonely farmer lets
his neighbor’s widow, who is offering
herself to him, slowly wither away: she
had separated him from the neighbor
when, both bachelors, they had been
farming together. It is an able study
of the occasions when, just as she had
brought him to the point of bridging
the gap between them, he did nothing.
In “The Fence” the sister of the man
who owns the property weeps at night
by the campfire of the man hired to put
up a fence, and refuses to be com-
forted: she is isolated from human
nature because her brother is her lover.
In “The Valley” the widower who has
engaged a cross-eyed girl to look after
his son gradually becomes fond enough
of her to entrust her with money to go
to town and buy furniture for them.
The story ends with the father and son
meeting train after train, and no girl
and no furniture. The dexterity of this
story lies in the sympathy the reader
is given for the girl who doesn’t come
back; a little warmth in the widower
might have made an affectionate second
wife of the girl: in the finely conveyed
atmosphere of his cold and airless life
she was a flame that very truly went
out.
Even in “Escape,” when a man
steals a car and drives off with a woman
to make love in the bush, their happi-
ness is made by a few deft touches to
seem a moment against eternity; over-
coming their individual isolation they
have isolated themselves against society.
“Whatever happens,” the woman says,
“I’m glad we stayed here.” And as he
stops the car near the siding where the
train is going to take them into the
future the man says, with considerable
symbolism: “We got farther than I
thought.”
So that it is a bit of a miracle when
in “The Unploughed Land” the hired
hand goes so far as to get the farmer’s
daughter with child and actually
resolves to marry her. The writing
about bush and farm, always accurate
in the other stories, here becomes
warmer and more fecund—it is as
though in this last story Cowan had
decided to make-up for the unfruitful
lives and wasted emotions of those
which have gone before.
Poetry Competition
First prize (£5O) in the 1958 poetry-
competition run by the Queensland
Authors and Artists’ Association and
Fellowship of Australian Writers went

Ron Harrison, Redcliffe, Queensland.
There were 589 entries.
Mountolive: Lawrence Durrell
(Faber). The third novel of a proposed
tetralogy, the first two being “Justine” -
and “Balthazar.” As a youth, Mount-
olive, a career diplomat, has a brief,
idyllic affair in Egypt with a beautiful,
middle - aged Copt. Years later,
appointed British Ambassador in
Alexandria, he finds her two sons up
to their ears in cloaks and daggers,
while she, disfigured by age and small-
pox, is trying rather stagily to avoid
him. Some of the chief characters from
the previous novels slip in and out of
the political and sexual intrigues that
follow. The writing about landscapes
and physical sensations is accurate and
graceful, but a bit self-conscious and
sometimes irrelevant. The author con-
tinues to like having a shot an Anglo-
Saxons for their “repressions.”
