Heinrich Heine.
THE admirable selection from Heine’s pub-
lished works issued by Walter Scott is
indeed a monument to the memory of the
great little German Jew with the Gallic
temperament. Stigand’s two ponderous volumes
are now moss-grown and worm-eaten. Dr. Evans’
book sees too little of Heine ; his vision is obscured
by Anglican spectacles. At this late day we have
grown accustomed to regard Heine as a personality
altogether literary. We have lost sight of the
man’s wonderful political significance. The man
whom it was found necessary to banish could
have been no _ mean foe to the German
autocracy of his day and generation; and
Heine’s political significance was accentuated
by the fact that the French Government
was proud and pleased to have him on its books
as an honoured pensioner of the State. Heine was
himself keenly appreciative of his renown as an
apostle of freedom- He called himself, not once
or twice, a knight of the Holy Ghost. He was a
staunch battler for liberty of thought, and the
expression of freethought, the sort of man
that would be just as distasteful to a Maori-
land autocracy of to-day as he was to the German
bureaucracy of a dead century.
Between the years 1837 and 1840 Heine is
believed to have written some four volumes of
memoirs, fragments of which have been given to
the world through the medium of Dr. T. W.
Evans’ book, entitled “ Memoir of the Youth of
Heinrich Heine.” Heine, however, has made
admission that lie was obliged to destroy nearly
half of his autobiographical material in deference
to family considerations. But, admitting this to
be the case, there must still be a considerable
existing portion unpublished, probably stored
away in the Austrian archives, because to Austria
(Stigand, Heine’s biographer, asserts) Heine’s
wife sold them. Walter Scott’s careful selection
from the poet’s works throws considerable addi-
tional light on Heine’s youth, but tells little that
was not already well known concerning his early
manhood.
Heinrich Heine was born on the 13th of Decem-
ber, 1799—although a passage [in the “Baths of
Lucca,” might lead people who don’t understand
the Heine humour to suppose that he began life
with the 19th century. Francesca, the delightful
ballerina, asks abruptly, “How old are you?”
Heine replies, “ Signora, I was born on the morn-
ing of New Year’s Day, 1800.” “Ah,” said the
Marchese, I have always told you that you were
one of the first men of the century.”
He spent his full-blooded youth amid the
stirring scenes of the Napoleonic campaigns. Of
these, he has left us vivid pictures in the “Reise-
bilder.” In the year 1825, as a very young man,
Heine abjured the faith of his fathers in order to
obtain those social advantages denied him as a
Jew. He, embraced Lutheranism, and gave as a
characteristic reason that he did so in order to
prevent Monsieur de Rothschild treating him with
familiarity. The salient points in the meteoric
career of this brilliant German Jew are summarised
in his University residence, his quixotic marriage
with Mathilde Mirat (the beautiful and ignorant
grisette who knew no ABC save that of calcu-
lating courtezanship) his acceptance of a pension
from the French Government, his paralytic attack,
his “ mattress-grave,” and his tragic death in 1856.
Heine was a favourite of the fairies. To him
each little fay brought some gem of intellectual
endowment. But a place at the christening was
denied to the most malicious of the elfin sister-
hood. In revenge she threw a pinch of bitterness
or incompleteness into the gift of each of the more
generous. Heine was a poet, physically beautiful,
with all the graces and gifts that endear a man to
women, and he who might have wedded princesses
was scorned and spurned by a Dutch doll. Hand-
some as Apollo, he lingered for years
with features distorted and frame emaciated.
Lame, blind and paralytic, he trod the
marge of the grave with a hero’s tread. The
stings of poverty and sickness dogged the heels of
his life. His humor was of a good-natured
type, but it was acidulated with the cynical anti-
thesis which borrowed its smart from an adverse
experience. His wit ethereal was degraded by a
material alloy—an alloy of misanthropy and blas-
phemy against all human kind. What of ideal
there was of him lapsed into the indifference of
roturierism ; his pathos was only the obverse of
ribaldry; his humor was the chuckle from a
death-mask. But blame him, nobody can. He
was the victim of the Fates. Heine was a Pagan.
He had, like many of us, not even the cheating
illusion of a wronged God’s forgiveness. His
verse breathes forth the Hedonism that Grant
Allen made religion of—that verse which exhales
a charm, subtle as the perfume of the violet,
instinct with seductive potency, evanescent and
intangible. This German Jew with the Gallic
temperament united the romantic tenderness of
the Teuton, the religious sentiment of the Hebrew,
and the cynical philosophy of the Frenchman.
During youth, the romantic element of a complex
temperament prevailed. Then he figured as a poet
of the school of Novalis, Schiller and Fouque.
Then he wrote some of his most beautiful and
idealistic poems.
As a soug-writet, Heine has never been equalled
by any poet for tenderness of sentiment and deli-
cacy of touch. As a lyric poet, Heine stands
unique, alone. He 'reclothed the beautiful
legends of undine and lorelei. To the old
Teutonic mythology he gave a vivid reality and
an ideal beauty. VVitb a swarm of golden fancies
his love-lays teem as a hive of bees in summer-
time. Thus Leland Englishes a gem :
A pine-tree’s standing lonely,
In the North on a mountain’s brow, <
Nodding, with whitest cover,
Wrapped up by the ice and snow.
He’s dreaming of a palm-tree .
V Which, far in the morning land,
Lonely and silent sorrows
’Mid burning rocks and sand.
There are a hundred similar lyrics in the “ Reise-
bilder” and the “ Buch der Lieder.” Heine was
a fount Caatalian. inexhaustible. But not always
was lie the poet of pure sensuousness, as witness :
How wearily time Crawls along,
That hideous snail that hastens not—
While I, without the power to move,
Am ever fixed to one dull spot.
Upon my dreary chamber wall
No gleam of sunshine can I trace ;
I know that only for the grave
Shall I exchange this hopeless place
Perhaps already I am dead,
And these perhaps are phantoms vain
These motley phantasies that pass
At night through my disordered brain.
Perhaps with ancient heathen shapes,
Old faded gods, this brain is full
Who, for their most unholy rites,
Have chosen a dead poet’s skull.
And charming, frightful orgies hold, —
The mad-cap phantoms ! —all the night,
That in the morning this dead hand
About their revelries may write.
But Heine is at root the poet of dreamy tender-
ness. The skull and cross-bones intrude not
often. Thus could he sing in a sweeter mood: —
I love a fair flower, but I know not its name ;
Oh, sorrow and smart!
I look in each flower-cup—my luck is the same :
For I seek for a heart.
The flowers breathe their perfume—in evening’s red shine,
The nightingale trills,
I seek for a heart which is gentle as mine,
Which as tenderly thrills.
The nightingale sings, and I know what she says
In her beautiful song,
We both are love-weary and lorn in our lays,
And oh ! Sorrow is loner !
Daley, among all Austral poets, has Heinesque
characteristics. At least he has that splendid gift
of clean-cut expression. Our German, among
many other things, wrote this little gem:—
The graceful water-lily
Looks dreamily up from the lake,
And the moon looketb lovingly on her
For light love keeps fond hearts awake.
Then she bows her small head to the water
Ashamed those bright glances to meet,
And sees the poor, pale lily lovers
All lying in love at her feet.
Heine’s invocation to the Devil is not the least
effective of the lighter verse he has written.
I called the Devil, and—he came.
In blank amaze his form I scanned ;
He is not ugly, is not lame,
But a refined, accomplished man.
One in the very prime of life ;
At home in every Cabinet strife,
Who, as diplomatist, can tell
Church and state news extremely well.
He is somewhat pale, and no wonder either,
Since he studies Sanscrit and Hegel together.
His favorite poet is still Fouqui.
Of criticism he makes no mention ;
Since all such matters unworthy attention,
He leaves to his grandmother, HecatA
He praised my legal efforts, and said
That he also, when younger, some law' had read,
Remarking that friendship like mine would be
An acquisition, and bowed to me.
Then I asked him if we had not met before
At the Spanish Minister’s soiree?
And as I scanned his face once more,
I found I had known him for many a day.
Besides Charles G. Leland the best-known of
Heine’s English translators are Sir Theodore
Martin, Kate Freiligrath Kroeker, J. E. Wallis,
James Thomson, Alma Strettell, Francis Hueffer,
George MacDonald, A. Rogers, Ernest Radford,
W. H. Furness, Emma Lazarus, John Todhunter,
Edgar A. Bowring, Richard Garnett, Franklin
Johnson, Heinrich Herz, J. Snodgrass, A. Mac-
millan, and Julian Fane. Perhaps, however,
Heine is better known to English readers from
Matthew Arnold’s In Memoriam verses, entitled
“Heine’s Grave,” than by anything written by
himself. But the latest selection published by
Walter Scott should do > much towards banishing
the reproach of neglect ‘by us of this fine classic
and choice wit. Yet, notwithstanding the general
ignorance of Heine’s great body of writing, mots
and aphorisms of his have passed into the mintage
of all languages. Of Napoleon he said—
He was one who was haunted by the spectre of free-
dom as by the ghost of a murdered mother.
Of Lafayette—
He has fashioned for himself a better column than that
of the Place de Vendome, and a better statue than one of
metal or marble. Where is there any marble as pure as
his heart ? Where is there any metal so strong as the
truth of old Lafayette ?—Defender of the People against
the cunning of the Great!
Of Napoleon again—
Napoleon is dead, and modern Philistinism breathes
freely, as if released from a brilliant nightmare. Over
his tomb springs up the era of Industrialism—an era
which admires quite other" heroes ; as for example the
virtuous Lafayette or James 'VVatt.
He could deal a trenchant blow at his own deity,
Democracy—
The goddess of Liberty seldom possesses a chemise, and
is, on that account, very bitter against all who wear clean
linen.
Heine’s eloquence was of the dithyrambic type.
Thus he writes of the Bible—
What a book ! vast and wide as the world, rooted in
the abysses of Creation, and towering up beyond the blue
secrets cjf heaven ; sunrise and sunset, promise and fulfil-
ment, birth and death, the whole drama of Humanity, all
are in this book. It is the book of books— Biblion ! '
Always a sensualist, religion was to him an indul-
gence—
In my youth I was often overpowered by the infinite
sweetness, the mysterious and blessed influence, the
delirious death ecstasy of Catholicism.
But Heine could never be serious. Just before
his death on his mattress-grave, he is reported to
have said—
A religious reaction has set in upon me for some time.
God knows whether the morphine or the poultices have
anything to do with it. It is so. I believe again in a
personal God. To this we come when we are sick, sick
unto death and broken down. Do not make a crime of
it. If the German people accept the King of Prussia in
their need, why should I not accept a personal God ? My
friend, hear a great truth. When health is used up,
money used up also, and sound human senses used up,
Christianity begins.
And his last words, when asked if he prayed for
the forgiveness of God—
Eh, God will forgive me ! that’s His business.
Of his wife Mathilde, w-fio perfunctorily hursed
bim through the years of his paralysis, he could
say—
Of such are the angels, they do not discount their
future ; they have always ready money.
Of this same wife, however, a somewhat different
and indifferent story is told. She had a parrot
called “ Cocotte.” One day Heine believed that
his spouse had deserted him; but was hugely
reassured by hearing “Cocotte” squawking some-
where in the house. Mathilde might desert the
dying poet—the living parrot, never! He re-
marked with inimitable mockery:
Had I not wife and parrot, I would (God forgive me the
sin), like a Roman, put an end to my misery.
Again,—
It just comes out of the marrow of life, the doctors
may console me as they like ; I have nothing to expect
but a miserable malady, probably full of vicissitudes. The
last circumstance has its advantages. When one sud-
denly wakes up deaf, one forgets for a time that one has
already been blind ; and what is the use of it ? Just none.
At the most this passion-story can serve as an advertise-
ment for the complete edition of my works for the benefit
of Campe and my wife.
Besides the “ Reisebilder, ” or travel-picture-
book, and the “ Buch der Lieder” (“Book of
Songs ”), Heine wrote hundreds of newspaper
articles on philosophy, literature and art. In the
Revue des Deux Mondes he printed “Contributions
to the History of Religion and Poetry in Ger-
many”—a most noteworthy -volume. Heine died
quietly in the grey morning of the 17th February,
1856, and lies buried in the cemetery of Mont-
marte, his grave bearing only a head-piece,
inscribed with the two words, “Henri Heine.”
Matthew Arnold, in his noble dirge to the
memory of the great German Hebrew (“Heine’s
Grave”) writes: —
“ Henri Heine ” —’tis here !
The black tombstone, the name
Carved there —no more! and th° smooth,
Swarded alleys, the limes
Touch’d with yellow by hot
Summer, but under them still
In September’s bright afternoon
Shadow, and verdure, and cool!
Trim Montmarte ! the faint
Murmur of Paris outside : *
Crisp everlasting flowers.
Yellow and black, on the graves.
Half-blind, palsied, in pain,
Hither to come, from the streets'
Uproar, surely not loath
Wast thou, Heine !—to lie
Quiet! To ask for closed
Shutters, and darken’d room,
And cool drinks, and an eased
Posture, and opium, no more !
Hither to come, and to sleep
Under jibe wings of Renown.
F.J.B.
"The Compleat Spooner."
“ Monowai ” gives the Book of Spooner, from
Genesis to Revelations:
1. The Man Spooner : Dean of New College, Oxford. A
timid little albino of 65. Supposed to know something
about Herodotus.
2. The Rise of the Spoonerism : Every generation of
Oxford barbarians requires its butt. Spooner succeeded
Jowett. Jowett reported to have been much amused at
a recital of Spoonerism!. “ Fifteen years ago,” he piped,
“ they used all these about me.”
3. The Archetypal Spoonerism : Sp. gave out the
hymn, “Conquering kings their titles take,” as “Tin-
quering tongs their kitles kake,” and then nervously
altered to “ Kinqering kongs.”
4. From this alleged incident sprang the Spoonerism,
which may be divided into—
A. The Spoonerism of Action.
B. The Spoonerism of Speech. (Spoonerismus Vul-
garis.)
(a) Entering the robm in a violent hurry, the Rev. Sp.
threw his paste-board cap at the back of the Are, and
spat in his arm-chair. Better, still, he once put the
cat under his pillow and kicked his watch downstairs.
In undergraduate days Sp. found boiling his gold watch
and timing himself with an egg.
At a railway-station farewell the Rev. Sp. gave two-
pence to his wife, and kissed the porter.
(b) “ Here beginneth,” gave out Sp., in the grand new
college chapel, with Sir Joshua’s windows staining his
featureless face with unwonted colour, “ Here beginneth
the Apostle of the Epistle Paul.”
“ We' all know what it is, my friends,” he said, “to
have a half-warmed fish [sc., half-formed wish] in our
bosoms.”
Found wandering about at Greenwich in vacation look-
ing for the “ Dull Man ” inn, where, he told a sailor, he
had been asked to dine. “No sich pub, sir,” said the
sailor. “Dear me,” said Sp., “it must have been the
‘Green Man Inn’ at Dulwich, and I thought it was the
‘ Dull Man Inn’ at Greenwich.”
“ I must have walked to-day,” he said, “ ten miles as
the fly crows.” (Shamelessly appropriated by a recent
London Punch).
Asked, at dinner, what sweet he would have—“ I
think,” jocularly said the Rev. Sp., “ I will have some of
that stink puff.” (Sc.: pink stuff).
“Sorrow may endure for a joy,” he. once gave out for
text, “ but night cometh in the morning 1 ”
“ Excuse me,” he said once in chapel to a trespassing
undergrad., “ but I think you are occuplacing my pie.”
The Jowlerism is a more recondite form of humour than
the Spoonerism, and less apocryphal, Dr. Jowett (alias
Jowler) having a genuine fund .of, bitter wit.
The daughters of a well-known Australian Q.C. visited
Oxford, armed with an introduction to Jowett. They
called. He did not return the call for a month,
and then, the night before they departed, caught them
roasting chestnuts round the hearth. “ I’m sorry,” he
piped, stumbling into the half-lighted room,, “ not to have
come before. I have been exceptionally busy ... or
else 1 forgot . . . I think it must have been the latter ! ”
“ Very good thing,” he once squeaked, “ so many young
men from this college going to be missionaries. It ivill
teach them how much good there is in other people’s
religions.”
The nervous undergraduate yarn. Five-mile walk with
Jowett. “Fine day, sir.” No answer. (Two miles
walked.) “ Balliol seems likely to do well on the river
this year.” No answer. (Two more miles.) “Oxford
looks its prettiest in the autumn.” No answer. (Balliol
reached.) “ Well-er-er, Johnson, you have made three
exceedingly common-place remarks. Good evening.”
From Victor Hugo—
In the domain of art there can be no light without heat.
Civilization exhales art as a flower its perfume.
The higher the plane of thought the more does the

Rumored in London that Oscar Wilde is the
undiscovered author of the much-discussed
‘‘ Englishwoman’s Love Letters,” one of the two
most financially successful of last year’s publica-
tions. The probabilities are that the rumor is well
founded. The style of the letters is sufficiently
degenerate to pass as brilliant with the multitude,
and Wilde’s reputation for brilliant writing rests
entirely upon an undoubted faculty for unhealthy
literary distortion whose designed effect is to
apparel innocent ideas with an atmosphere of
ingenious evil.
ACHIEVEMENT.
Who says we fail? We prosper beyond dreams,
As architect of ruin we have no peer.
We thought to Are but farmsteads ; we have lit
A flame less transient in the hearts of men.
We are ill at building, yet have we at least
Destroyed to better purpose than we knew,
We have raised up heroes where we found but hinds.
We have ravaged well, our rapine is not vain.
Redder from our red hoofprints the wild rose
Of Freedom shall afresh hereafter spring,
And in our own despite are we the sires
Of Liberty, as night begets the day.
Sufficient claim to memory this I deem,
Title enow, were other passport none.
The Speaker.

WHAT WARNER’S
SAFE
CURE DOES.
WARNER’S SAFE CURE
The remarkable power possessed by Warner’s Safe
coming all diseases of both the liver and kidneys
scientists and specialists throughout the world.
Cure in over-
is conceded by
WARNER’S SAFE CURE
Restoring to health and activity the kidneys and liver, necessarily
cures all disorders arising from the failure of those important organs
to cleanse the blood of urea, uric acid, and other poisonous impurities.
Indigestion and Dyspepsia
Are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure, for the simple reason that good
digestion is assured when the liver and kidneys are acting normally.
The digestive organs are then supplied with pure blood, which is in a
condition to absorb nutriment freely.
Biliousness and Headache
are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. When the liver and kidneys are
properly performing their duties there is no such thing as biliousness,
no such thing as headache. All bile formed is duly delivered to the
intestines, and act as nature’s catharthic.
Rheumatism, Sciatica,
lumbago, and Gout,
Are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. These disorders all arise from
the presence in the blood of urinary and biliary poisons, due to the
defective action of the kidneys and liver. As soon as the kidneys and
liver are restored to health these poisons are expelled from the system
in a natural manner, and these diseases are consequently cured.
Neuralgia
is cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. Neuralgia is caused by poverty of
blood, and the excruciating pain felt is but the demand of the nerves
for richer blood. A healthy action of the kidneys and liver ensures
rich blood.
Anaemia and Debility
are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. This medicine, causing as it does,
the liver and kidneys to act perfectly, every particle of food eaten goes
to replace nature’s waste and build up the constitution. A proper
and generous diet is all that is then necessary to make the weak strong
and the pale face flush with the bloom of health.
Blood Disorders
Are cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. Pure blood is incompatible with
boils, skin eruptions, etc. Warner’s Safe Cure, by inducing a perfect
action of the kidneys and liver, causes all impurities to be extracted
from the blood and to be expelled from the body.
Gravel and kindred Troubles
Arp; cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. The specific action of the medicine
upon the kidneys and other organs restores them to health; the
accumulated acids are dissolved, and the troubles cease.
Bright’s Disease
Is cured by Warner’s Safe Cure. This remedy is the only medicine
known to science which will cure this dread disease.
ISP" So many millions of bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure have been used in all parts
of the world that it is now easy for anyone to make inquiry amongst personal
friends, and as a result become convinced as to the marvellous curative properties of
the medicine. A pamphlet containing further particulars will be sent, post paid, to
any address on application to H. H. Warner & Co., Limited, Australasian branch,
528 to 532 Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, Victoria.


Cheap toys are now extensively made from
disused wooden paving-blocks. It needs no expert
to determine the condition of wood that has been
soaking for years in the mire and grime of the
streets. The Salvarmy in Australia has recently
adde.l toy-making to its list of sweat works.

THE RESULT OP

Another Maitland Proof.
Th* Case of
Mr. W. COLEMAN.
(BY our reporter.)
To convey to the reader an impression of
the real importance of the subject which is
dealt with t elow in any other way than to
despatch a special reporter to the residence
of Mr. William Coleman, of Pitnacree road,
East Maitland, would be an impossi ility,
and when we get our information direct
from the author reliance can be placed on
its genuineness. Mr. Coleman began by
saying :
“I am a brickmaker, and when I com-
menced to suffer many years ago I thought
that the injurious elements connected with
my work were responsible for my health
breaking down. Such a strange feeing
came over me that I wondered what was
the matter. For a long time I felt out of
sorts, 1 eing languid and tired before I star-
ted work in the mornings, and with no am-
bition or interest in regard to anything I
had to do. In the hot weather I had no
energy at all, feeling so drowsy and de-
pr< ssed that 1 only wanted to lie down
quietly away from everybody. An aching
pain used to come to my brow in the early
part of the day, and stay there till I fell
asleep When I woke up again the same
distressing aches renewed their activity, and
in this way I was kept in a constant state
of misery.”
“ Were those the only discomfarts you
had to endure ? ” asked the writer.
“ If they had been the only ones I would
have considered myself very fortunate.
Worse luck, I had all sorts of agonies to
put up with, and I noticed that they were
always much worse after I had been eating.
My appetite was by no means good, and, of
course, I ate ut very sparingly; yet, if I had
overburdened my stomach with food, the
symptoms of indigestion could not have been
more severe. There was a t earing down
pain in my chest, as if something heavy and
indigesti le had stuck there, and as I drew
my breath I felt s if a weight had been
placed upon me.® I was troubled with 1 etch-
ing of wind, and also cramping pains in the
stomach, which used to swell out owing to
the quantity of gas which seemed to rise up
from my food. At times my legs and loins
ached so acutely that it was too much like
hard work to go for a walk, while an intense
pain in the back also induced me to stay in
doors, as it became quite unbearable if I
exerted myself in any way. If anything
occasioned me to stoop or bend my head I
instantly turned giddy, and sometimes my
sight was so bad that when I went out I was
somewhat bewildered by the clouded ap-
pearance of everything in front of me. Pal-
pitation of the heart was another matter
which brought anxiety to my mind, especi-
ally as I did not know how it was caused,
and I would have been much happier with-
out the sickly taste which was in my mouth
every morning. My nights became more
restless than ever, as I not only experienc d
greater difficulty in falling asleep, but what
little sleep I did get was made unrefreshing
by the presence of nasty dreams. Thus, I
was uneasy and troubled both night and
day, and in these circumstances it will not
surprise you to hear that I became strangely
affected with nervousness. My brain dwelt
upon th* most unpleasant subjects I could
think o • feme dreadful thing was going
to happen, according to my imaginations,
and no matter what was said or done I
never felt cheerful. The gradual escape of
my vitality weighed heavily upon my mind.
A coated tongue and the color of my skin
were constant reminders of the disease
which was making a wreck of me, for you
must know that I lost a good deal of weight,
besides getting very weak.”
“ You must have been suffering some con-
•iderable time ? ” r
“ Mj complaint hung on to mo for fully
two years, so that you will not think it was
extraordinary for me to feelasifall the bright-
ness had vanished from my life. Often I
stayed away from work because I was too
ill and feeble to do it, and how I would
have fared but for Clements Tonic I do
not like to imagine. Although my suffer-
ings were very great I did not go to a doc-
tor, and I think that I have reason to be
glad that I did not, as Clements Tonic was
evidently just what I required. fc The ex-
pense of getting medical advice was saved,
and so was I, for Clements Tonic made a
new man of me, and I heartily advise any-
body suffering from the same complaint as
mine to keep pounds in their packets by
using the remedy which cured me. The
first benefit I derived from the use of
Clements Tonic was the recovery of my
appetite. I surprised everybody with the
way I could eat when I had taken a couple
of Lotties of that medicine, and by-and-bye
I experienced wonderful relief from pain.
It is easy to account for that, as it all lay ii
the fact that my digesti.ve organs were bei,
beneficially operated upon by Clement.-
Tonic. My mind became cheerful again
when I discovered that I was on the right
track at last. • There was no uneasiness in
my chest after meals, neither was there any
pain or flatulence in the stomach. I was
more restful in my bed, and it was some-
thing that I greatly appreciated to be able
to sleep peacefully till morning. My head-
aches were soon ended by Clements Tonic,
and the pains in my 1 ack and shoulders were
also stopped. These were not the only
blessings which flowed from the bottles con-
taining Clements Tonic, as palpitation and
giddiness disappeared as well The ability
to regulate and strengthen my system in
every conceivable way was undeniably
possessed by the medicine I was taking, and
no words of mine would ever do full justice
to Clements Tonic for buil ing up my ner-
vous system in the splendid manner that it
did. Instead of feeling drowsy and half
dead I now felt bright and full of animation
and vitality. The wretched aches that hung
about my loins and lim s so long were en-
tirely swept away, and I must give Clements
Tonic credit for bestowing upon me such
powers of endurance that I could work
hard all day without feeling tired or dis-
tressed. '1 he flesh which had wasted away
from my body was recovered, and the altera-
tion in my complexion showed that my liver
affectious had been removed, and that
Clements Tonic had also purified my blood.
In fact, my health was sound in every de-
tail, and I think I would he doing a great
wrong to the general public if I withheld
these statements from them.”
“ Iu that case it will be necessary to pub-
lish them.”
“ I am quite willing that you should pub-
lish them in any way which will be most
serviceable.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, William Coleman, of Pitnacree-road, East

receiving any payment; and I make this solemn de-
claration conscientiously believing the same to be
true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths
Act, 1900.

“Sufferer from
Indigestion ”
*» Anything I ate caused me great
pain and distress ”
We often find that deranged digestion i 3
no more and no less than an indication of
low vitality. Enrich the blood with the
properties which renew the vital spark of
life, and dig stion will respond to the treat-
ment and become in a normal state again.
These facts speak for themselves :
“ 121, Great George’s Street,
“ Wigan, Lancashire, England,
“ December 31st, 1900.
“Dear Sirs,—For the past four years I
have been a great sufferer from indigestion,
and during that time have tried many
different remedies, but failed to find any-
thing that suited my condition. I suffered
from a poof appetite, and anything I ate,
no matter how simple, would not digest,
and caused me great pain and distress.
My condition got worse, and I became
seriously ill. My doctor advised me to take
Sour Scott’s Emulsion, and the same evening
e did so I read a testimonial in a
Manchester paper from a graduated male
nurse, stating his experience with Scott’s
Emulsion, and the many cases in which he
w. MANTLE.
(From a photograph.)
had found it had given good results. This
determined me to give the preparation a
trial, and before I had taken the contents of
one bottle I was so well satisfied with the
results that I made up my mind to give it a
fair test. I have found so much benefit
from the continued use of Scott’s Emulsion
that I now have a new relish for food, and
no longer feel any distress after my meals.
X am perfectly free from all the distressed
feelings I experienced before taking the
Emulsion, and can eat anything without
the least sign of deranging my digestion.—
Yours very truly, (Signed) W. Mantle.
There are properties in Scott’s Emulsion
which have a direct action upon the
digestive system. Hypophosphites of lime
and soda, for instance, stimulate the
appetite and assist digestion in many ways,
while cod-liver oil has a beneficial effect
upon the entire alimentary canal. The
most important work of Scott’s Emulsion
in the system, however, is in restoring
vitality, and giving that resistive force to
life which represents vigour and health. We
cannot say that Scott’s Emulsion will cure
a chronic case of dyspepsia, but we do know
that it is beneficial to the entire digestive
system, as is shown clearly in the case
which we have placed before you.
The consumptive, and all other anaemic
persons, find Scott’s Emulsion of great
advantage in giving them strength to over-
come the wasting conditions of the system.
When the blood is depleted, the whole
organism is reduced to a state of low vitality,
and there is no remedy that can be employed
that will be as effectual as Scott’s Emulsion.
Babies and children who do not thrive,
derive health and strength from its use.
It is a mistake to think that Scott’s
Emulsion is like other forms of cod-liver
oil. Scott’s Emulsion is palatable, and does
not dei ange digestion. If you will be care-
ful to purchase only the genuine preparation
and make a trial of it, you will soon learn
its superiority.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpence to Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

When the Wool Comes In I
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis a lazy life and languid round the railway-
stations when
No wool’s piled on the platforms or the sidings
lone and gray;
When the porter lies half-sleeping while the
“boss’s” rusty pen
Scratches dreamy notes to No One, in a tired-out,
sleepy way.
But, behold ! a change swings over when the first
wool-team comes in,
With its heaped-up bales roped tightly and its
dusty man of sin.
Men waken from their dreams
When the creaking bullock-teams
Signify to all and sundry that the Wool is
coming in !
O, the William-cans are loaded at the hostel ’cross
the road,
And the good old “Damns” and “Blankies”
soar across the smiling sky.
Things recover from their torpor and man’s
planetoid abode
Turns a pleasing face and bosom to the one-time
carping eye,
When the teams from Way-to-Blazes bring their
loading safely in—
O, the porter-men make merry and gird on a
cheerful grin;
For the Wool means lots of Beer,
And the earth is full of cheer
For the jaded railway loafers when the bales are
coming in.
The land is full of curses and they fall on it like
rain—
The cheerful objurgations of the Bringer of the
Wool;
And the skies are streaked with language as he
hurries back again
To fetch another burden, while we oram the goods-
sheds full.
O, the Wool, jolly Wool! When it comes a-orowd-
ing in
Our life is worth the living, and a pleasant breath
of Sin
Stirs the lazy, stagnant air,
And we break the back of Care,
And hang out Grief to dry, the time the Wool is
rolling in.

Dobbins on the Tip.
There’s five-and-forty navvies in the cutting on
the hill,
There’s five-and-forty navvies' in the gang;
You can hear the clay-clods falling in the dobbins
as they fill;
In the gravel you can hear the shovels clang.
For we’re working late and early, and the ganger
on the top
Has his eyes upon the sweating crowd below ;
If you’re spotted as a talker, your name will soon
be Walker!
For the shirkers from the workers lave to go.
Then it's lend your hand and lift her /
That's the way, my hoys, to shift her !
Heave it lively / or the boss will rear and rip :
“ Run that dobbin out 1 ” he’s bawling,
And to-day he'll stand no crawling,
For they're calling out for dobbins on the tip !
When the Summer sun is beating with a cruel
burning heat
On the “ heading ’’—still, that you may endure ;
For the roving breezes fan you, and the air is fresh
and sweet:
In the cutting it is fetid and impure.
You choke and gasp and stifle, and your breath
comes fiery hot—
And you long with fervent longing for the breeze,
That is ever, ever blowing, and far above you
flowing—
You hear it singing past you in the trees.
Hear the shovels clang and clatter I
See the stones roll doion the batter /
Dodge them as they hop and jump and skip !
Watch your chance and stand from under ;
Lose no time and make no blunder,
For they're calling out for dobbins on the tip I
When the dewdrops gleam and glisten in the early
rose-lit dawn,
And the Day-God sheds his first faint smile on
earth,
Little fairy flowerets laugh along the rock-strewn
lawn;
The bush birds sing their morning hymn of mirth.
The navvy boils his billy, and bolts his sodden
grub,
Then hastens to the chasm in the hill—
To his dreary, dismal toiling while his fevered
blood is boiling—
Oh, a glutton in a cutting gets his fill!
While on top—the ganger—hear him !
You curse him, though you fear him—
It's pay-day has our manhcod on the hip ;
There's your ticket if you grumble ;
So the rock you break and crumble,
And send it rolling outward to the tip l
The long day nears its ending, and westward sinks
the sun ;
The fitful, waning shadows come and go ;
We w«>ch the final dobbin jolting on the outward
WhmTwe ’re waiting for the welcome word “ Yo-
ho! ”
And when Life’s long day is over, and the last
“ Yo-ho ! ” is said,
And the navvy has for ever downed his tools—_
As he goes across the River, will his weary spirit
shiver, _
As he plunges in its cold and silent pools :
“ Dust to dust, and ash to ashes ! ”
Close the eyes and smooth the lashes —
See old Charon waiting yonder with his ship /
When the navvy goes down under,
Oh, I wonder ! oh, I wonder !
Will he hear them call for dobbins on the tip l

SATURDAY. APRIL 26, 1902.
South Australia and its Jenkins.
Early next month South Australia goes to
the poll to consider how one of the most lost
States in Australasia may best be saved.
Premier Jenkins and Tory leader Darling
are the loudest applicants for the billet of
saviour. There is a stupendous contract for
the man who gets the appointment, and if
the appointed person really does the work
his salary should be raised to £60,000 a year,
with a pension upon retirement. He would
be worth the money. S.A. politics have for
some time been drifting back to the old,
indefinite condition from which Kingston
extricated them. Before Kingston’s day
one leader was so much like another, as a
rule, that it hardly mattered who was in
office. There were few party distinctions,
few big political battle-cries, and generally
little public interest in politics. Spectral
Ministries fled across the stage like ghosts—
Kingston’s made the 40th in 36 years. His
Cabinet existed for 6j years —an unprece-
dented event in S. A. history—and then the
procession of shadows and dreams resumed,
and in 2| years Holder, Solomon and Jen-
kins have successively stampeded athwart the
political field of view. InKiNGSTON’stimeS. A.
had a strong, definite democratic policy ; it
had none for a long time before him, and it has
had none since. Kingston supplied it with
a State Land Bank, he increased the land and
income tax, laid a special graduated tax on
large estates, imposed an absentee-tax, and
otherwise did his best to break up the
ruinous land monopoly ; reduced the loan
profligacy to the lowest limit it has reached
in S.A. for many years, and almost made
ends meet—in six years his total shortage
was £94,000. Now that the big man is gone
the very small men are scuffling again on the
steps of the empty Treasury.
The man who sets to work to save a
country needs to consider first of all how
far, and in what respects, the country is lost.
Here are the principal features as regards
the lostness of S.A. :
It is a country seemingly almost devoid of minerals, or
rather one whose scanty mineral resources have been
almost worked out. Even Tasmania, a p ace which is a
mere speck on the map by comparison, produces much
more than three times its output.
Its want of coal makes the manufacturing outlook very
unpromising.
It lives very largely on agriculture, but it is the driest
of all the States, and the most barren. It has just
scraped together another 54 bushel harvest; it is always
granting seed-wheat to its distressed farmers ; there is a
movement on for a large exodus of its impoverished Ger-
man agriculturists to Queensland, and the area under
cultivation this year is a trifle less than it was in 1884 —18
years ago.
A larger proportion of its farmers are tenants, and
kept down by the rent incubus, than is the case in any
other State, though this evil has diminished somewhat in
recent years.
At June, 1901, it had, in proportion to population, the
heaviest debt in this world, and though Queensland may
have got ahead of it since then it still holds a good second
place. It owes £69 16s. 4d. per head—practically £2BO
for a family of four or £419 for a family of six. Think of
a family like the Schippans owing £419 ! It owes over
£6,000,000 (i 16 16s. 4d. per head, or over £67 for a
family of four) which is represented by no assets what-
ever, and this item alone amounts to more than the total
debt in the great majority of European countries.
It has had ten deficits in 19 years, and has added the
bulk of them (not quite £1,000,000) to its permanent
debt.
Its railways depend for their profit mainly on the
traffic with Broken Hill. Broken Hill is now in a bad
way, and so S.A. is in a bad way. When Broken Hill is
finished and worn out, unless some special Providence
comes to S.A.’s assistance, it will be in a much worse way.
The value of its wool exports in 1900 was not much
more than half, and of its wheat and flour exports about
one-third the figures for 1884.
Its land revenue, which was £604,745 twenty years ago,
is now £151,888 and is still falling.
It had, a few years ago, four fire insurance companies
which are dead; two life assurance offices which are
dead ; and four banks, three of which are dead. It once
owned the second largest fire office in the Commonwealth
States, and among its dead banks is the great institution
which was named after the State and which dated
practically from the State’s first beginnings. These cir-
cumstances not only mean a loss to the State through the
profits of these businesses going abroad ; they are also
signs of decadence.
* * * *
A big man is wanted to undertake the
saving of a country in this condition. The
position of'Queensland and Tasmania is -bad
enough, yet a mere Jenkins, if he had
courage and good intentions, might save
them. They have resources which S.A.
doesn’t possess, and only the inconceivable
mismanagement and cowardice of their
rulers have brought them to their present
pass. But somebody bigger than a Jenkins
or a Darling, even if they had the best in-
tentions instead of the worst, is required to
drag S.A. out of its troubles. It hasn’t been
doing any very violent financial drunks of
late years—in fact, it is now, barring Vic-
toria, the smallest borrower in proportion to
population in the Commonwealth. But it
can’t stand even that addition to its burdens.
It shattered its mind by an appalling
razzle nearly 20 years ago—for the single
year 1881 its loan expenditure ran to over
£6 per inhabitant, and it didn’t begin to
sober up for ten years after that; and it never
had the constitution of some of its neighbors,
so it became a debilitated old person at a
very early age. The gold and silver finds
which pulled some of the other States
through at times of crisis didn’t happen its
way. Not only a great part of its railway
earnings, but about half its commerce, de-
pend on that temporary institution, Broken
Hill. It has done remarkably well in
manufactures, considering its disadvantages,
but still its industries only employ some
16,000 hands, and precarious Broken Hill is
one of their supports also. There have been
a remarkable number of rich men in S.A.
considering its lack of resources, but they
made their wealth in the days when there
were land booms and copper booms and wool
booms and loan booms. Now there is noth-
ing to do except to grow low-priced wool and
produce on the driest and least productive
soil in Australasia, and run manufacturing
industries without a local coal supply, and
to be the commercial outlet of Broken Hill,
which will some day become a rabbit-haunted
wilderness again.
• * • *
Darling, the boss Tory of S.A., has a
theory that State Governments should be
abolished, and the Federal Parliament made
sole ruler of Australia. That might save a
little money, but it wouldn’t make S.A. any
less barren, less devoid of minerals and the
sinews of manufacturing industry, or less
indebted. Jenkins doesn’t appear to have
even that amount of theory. And both
Darling and Jenkins agree that the
community should trust to the great
non - existent resources of its dusty
land, and treat all hostile comments with
contempt, as the work of a public
enemy. That is what all Australia has
been doing for a long while, and it is
what every country which went broke did till
the breakage arrived. S.A., with no debt,
or with a debt of, perhaps, £lO per inhabi-
tant, might be as solid as New South Wales
or Victoria, with a debt of £5O per head, the
affairs of the three States being equally well
administered. When it staggers under a
heavier burden than either of them, its con-
dition is lamentable. It can’t be saved by
any big heroic schemes. No immense
financier and vast political bounder of the
Rhodes type would do it any good, for there
is nothing to annex or to steak What is re-
quired as its ruler is an enlightened and pro-
gressive miser, with a capacity for cheese-
paring which goes even beyond genius. It
should abolish all borrowing; one of the
poorest countries going, with, in proportion
to population, the second biggest debt on
earth, can t afford to get into any further
trouble. It should cut down its Governor’s
salary to £5OO a year, and, it being impossi-
ble to get one at the money, let some retired
Judge wield the rubber-stamp of office with
the above amount as an addition to his pen-
sion. It should abolish its Legislative
Council, which costs a free railway-pass
and £2OO annually per member, also some
expense for gas, upholstery, and reporting.
It should try even now to recover its
Adelaide Tramway rights from Snow, the
syndicate man ; an investment which pro-
mises to yield even £lO,OOO a year over and
above interest on its cost is one which the
country can’t afford to lose. It should found
a State life assurance office and a State fire
insurance department in order to keep in
the country as much as possible of the
profits which now go abroad under these two
headings ; and cease hankering after an
Outer Harbor for the present; and set aside
£500,000 a year out of revenue for public
works, even if it is necessary, in order to
raise the money, to further increase the in-
come tax, and double the absentee tax,
and levy more taxation on that absentee
corporation, the S.A. Co., and make the
totalisator a Government monopoly, and
run a State lottery, and charge a
license fee on all shopkeepers, and establish
a State drink monopoly, and increase the
minimum fine for being drunk to £l, and do
other energetic things. It should do all that
is possible to create new local industries, and
cease sending to the Federal Parliament
foolish persons like Glynn, who clamor for
the destruction of the customs revenue in
order that French and German manu-
facturers may thrive at this country’s
expense. Then in a dozen or twenty years,
with the growth of population and no
corresponding increase of debt, the burden
which is now nearly £7O a head might be
only £5O, and later on only £3O, and with
this diminution S.A. might become a reason-
ably prosperous place.
* * * *
But as Jenkins Iscariot is only a show-
man with a gift of showman’s patter, and
the other loud applicant for the Premier’s
position is merely a dull, stodgy, utterly
unprogressive representative of the old
Tory crowd whose boom policy was
largely responsible for all S.A.’s troubles,
the State had better have nothing to do with
either of them. There remains the Labor
party, which most closely represents the old
Kingston policy, and the Kingston policy
represented the nearest approach to sober,
sane, and solvent administration South
Australia has known for very many years.
Whether the Labor party without Kingston
would, be a success is a matter for specula-
tion, but the country knows that the party
with which Darling is associated is not a
success ; it knows that Jenkins Iscariot is
a failure; and to continue ringing the
changes on two failures is mere foolishness.
The country declared in the main for the
Kingston policy, and it has never gone back
on that decision. Jenkins has abandoned
the Kingston programme in every impor-
tant detail, and it is time for the country to
abandon Jenkins. There is a legend about
the inadvisability of changing horses while
crossing a stream, but when the horse is
practically dead and remains all the time in
the middle of the stream without getting any
further he isn’t crossing the stream within
the meaning of the Act. Moreover, the
only time this country can change is while
crossing a stream; it is Australia’s mis-
fortune to be doing that all the year round.
Yet even the most promising party in
present S.A. politics is a sorrowful dis-
appointment, so far as some features of its
programme are concerned. At a time when
S.A.’s present expenditure is far ahead of
the revenue, it proposes to add to the
outgoings £lOO,OfJO or more per annum
for old age pensions, and to increase
the wages paid on Government con-
tracts, and it doesn’t make the slightest
suggestion as to how it proposes to raise the
money. No party has a right to talk of old
age pensions or a minimum wage on Govern-
ment contracts in S.A. just now, unless it
has a plan for raising £500,000 a year more
income, or is prepared to take the responsi-
bility of advocating the repudiation of the
public liabilities.
* * • •
Still the Labor party, which proposes to
pay old age pensions without providing the
money, is far more attractive than the other
parties, which went murdering Boers without
providing the money, and the best thing
S.A. can do is to give the Labor party its
solid vote, and wait to see what will happen.
Its financial policy is at least no worse than
that of the hopeless Darling and the hope-
less Jenkins Iscariot ; and the rest of its
policy is immeasurably better. In fact, it is
the only S.A. party which has a policy at
the present time.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Stricken West.
All the West of N.S.W. is naked and vermin-
infested. The rabbits are worse than scab in
sheep or locusts amongst green vines—but, even if
the rabbits were exterminated, the ghastly naked-
ness of the land would only become more
assertively plain. It is the bald, bleached skull of
a desert which now extends from the slopes of the
main divide to the coastal lands of the West. We
have worn it down so by the attrition of our system
of occupation. We have “rung,” burned, lopped,
thrashed down all sorts of eucalypti and casuarina,
myall, and mulga, boree and kooba. Sheep have
eaten the salt and cotton-bush off the surface, and
the rabbits have gnawed the crowns of their roots
out of the ground. Blue Mitchell and kangaroo
grasses are extinct over thousands of square miles,
and the wild-oat, carrot and barley-grass will
spring no more. What is to be done with such a
land ? Kill off the rabbits ? Certainly. Turn
on the water? Yes, every cubic foot avail-
able. But, what then? The squatters’ sheep
and axes _ have destroyed all the native
growths which would afford sustenance to prob-
able stock, and no permanent good can be done
till they are by some means restored. It is a big
question this—bigger, so far as the real desolate
West is concerned, than that of water-supply. A
vast area of N.S.W. territory is of no more use to
the squatter now than is a cut-out forest to a
timber-getter, and no use will be got out of it till
a work akin to that of re-forestation is undertaken
in a practical way. Nobody in Australia has
really thought about such a work as yet, thougli a
good many people in the Western States of
America have gone far beyond thinking of the
value of our saltbush. They have imported hun-
dreds of bushels of seed ; they have thousands of
acres of flourishing saltbush plantations ; whereas,
in Australia, we have not a 100-acre patch, and
are not likely to under present circumstances.
Yet there is no insuperable difficulty about the
matter. If the Australian doesn’t know enough
to cultivate his own native vegetable, who should
know?
The Latest O’Sullivanism.
The N.S.W. O’Sullivan has appropriately inter-
rupted a discussion on a “Folly Point ” tramway
to write to Earl Rosebery, one of the trustees
under the will of the late Cecil Rhodes, asking
him to give a matter of £IOO,OOO or so, out of the
dead millionaire’s fishily-acquired wealth, for
raising a statue of “ Australia Facing the Dawn ”
on Pinchgut Island, Sydney Harbor (the O’Sul-
livan avoids mentioning Pinchgut, by the way).
This, he points out, would be an appropriate
means of glorifying Australian Federation (and
the O’Sullivan), and incidentally
would be a graceful recognition of the valuable service
rendered to the British Empire at a severe crisis in its
history by Australasian troops in South Africa.
Unfortunately, the emphatic answer that such ?
request deserves won’t come from Rosebery.
The O’Sullivan transparently prigged his “ Aus
tralia Facing the Dawn ” idea from Bartholdi’s
statue of “Liberty Facing the World” in New
York harbor, and sorrily degraded it in the
prigging. The erection of the Liberty Statue by
one free nation, on the shores of the land of
another which it had assisted to Freedom, was a
noble and poetic idea. To raise, on the “ Pinch-
fut” rock, soaked in the blood and tears of
unger-tortured convicts, a memorial to record
how Australia assisted to strangle the liberty of
another free people—and to raise it out of the
dishonestly-acquired, blood-stained wealth of a
Rhodes —that is a damnable plagiarism of a great
thought. It is not likely that Rosebery (who
is a son-in-law of London Stock Exchange) will
point all this out to Mr. O’Sullivan, for Rose-
bery’s is an essentially politic mind ; but it can
hardly help occurring to him.
Reproductive Works which Produce
Nothing.
Two curious extracts from last week’s papers
£4,000,000 was borrowed on the distinct understand-
ing that the money was to be used for the purchase of
reproductive property. We were assured that it added
nothing to the real indebtedness of the country as the
interest would be paid out of returns, thereby leaving
the taxpayers unburdened. —Sydney Telegram! leading
article.
Of course it goes without saying that loan expenditure
employed on reproductive works is no burden.—Mel-
bourne Age leading article.
The Bulletin begs to file its caveat against that
last proposition, which is another of the comfort-
ing delusions of the borrowing disease. Money
borrowed for reproductive works may ruin a
country just as money borrowed for unproductive
works does. The fact that the Australian rail-
ways earned last year about £4,000,000 in the
country doesn’t prove that Australia can afford to
send every year £4,000,000 interest on railway
loans out of the country. The buildings of Syd-
ney and its suburbs and of N.S.W. generally are
reproductive works and return good rents, but if
they, as well as the railways, had all been built
with borrowed money N.S.W. would have to
send away in interest about £12,000,000 a year,
and it would go bankrupt through borrowing for
reproductive works. Of course about that time
the works would cease to be reproductive, but
that hardly meets the case. Works are repro-
ductive because the people have monev with
which to pay for the use of them, and do pay for
the use of them. The fact that they have that
money is largely owing to the floating of new loans
to replenish the stock of cash which would other-
wise disappear in payment of foreign interest. In
other words, the Government borrows money to
build reproductive works. Then it borrows more
money to keep these works reproductive. Plenty
of works that are reproductive while the State is
borrowing cease to be so when the borrowings
diminish. Victoria’s railways, which yielded as
much as £4 3s. 7d. per cent, and paid their way
in a year of great borrowing, dropped to a humble
return of £2 4s. lOd. per cent., and became a
heavy charge on the taxpayer in a year when
hardly any loans were floated, and if there had
been no loans at all they might have fallen lower.
The Dead Democrat.
In view of the visit to N.S.W. of the Premier of
Maoriland (Mr. Seddon), the council of the British Empire
League of Australia will hold a special meeting at four
o’clock this afternoon at the School of Arts, the object
being to take steps to suitably recognise the eminent
services rendered by Mr. Seddon to the Empire.—S.M.
Herald.
They gave him for the Empire’s sake
A feast with fine Eclat;
They little know it was the wake
Of Dick of Kumara.
What wreath should crown the festive glass
For him foresworn, foregone?
Rue for Remembrance, and also
Rue for oblivion.
And has he come at last to that,
And ends his record thus ?
A dead soul buried deep in fat—
A huge sarcophagus.
The worst thing possible for man,
Though he may seem to thrive,
It is to spoil his Maker’s plan—
Be dead —and look alive.
This was the man by Fortune picked
To hold a splendid sway—
Alnaschar Seddon who has kicked
His golden eggs away.
De mortuis ! He is no more,
And let it rest at that —
And throw a clod of sorrow o’er
The old Dead Democrat.


As regards such a case as the See Government s
£4,000,000 resumption loan, floated in England,
the interest on that is almost wholly a dead loss
to N.S.W., even if the rents of the resumed area
pay all the interest, or pay it twice over. The
transaction simply means that £4,000,000
worth of property formerly owned in Australia
is now virtually owned in England, and
that (say) £140,000 a year of rents that
used to be spent in Australia now go to
England, and that the drain on this country’s
resources is £130,000 a year greater than it was.
As for the £3,600,000 odd which this country
received from England it has already been frit-
tered away, and there is no more money in
N.S.W. and no more apparent prosperity than
there was before. Borrowing money abroad
for productive works is only a shade less ruin-
ous than doing the same for non-productive
works. A work is not productive, in the true sense
of the term, because the public is willing to pay
enough for the use of it to cover interest on the loan;
only if it adds enough to the wealth of the coun-
try. An opera co., or an Eiffel tower, or a three-
headed man, if imported with money raised by
foreign loan at 3| per cent., might attract enough
cash to pay 10 per cent, interest on the loan, but
as they would add nothing to the wealth of the
country the interest would be a dead loss to the
country all the same, and, despite their produc-
tiveness, they would be wholly unproductive.
The same might be said of a thumbscrew, which,
if used for the purpose intended, generally pro-
duces a great deal more than 3£ per cent, interest
on its cost.
The Plea of Poverty.
How the public expenditure increases;
1896. 1901. Increase.
Tasmania .-. £750,244 .. £865,000 .. £104,756
S. Australia.. 2,509,468 .. 2,957,954 .. 448,486
Queensland .. 3,567,947 .. 4,855,533 .. 1,287,586
Westralia .. 1,823,863 .. 3,165,244 .. 1,341,381
Victoria .. 6,540,182 .. 7,986,475 .. 1,446,293
N.S. Wales .. 9,852,034 .. 11,350,442 .. 1,498,408
The increase in the cost of government is far ahead
of any increase of population, and in no case had
public works expenditure any important bearing
on the case—that was paid out of loans as usual.
Moreover, in 1901, all the States, especially
Tasmania, had shifted a portion of their ex-
penditure on to the Federal Government, so things
are even worse than they look. Every State has
acquired the easy habit of scattering all the money
it can raise and a little more, without making any
provision for its public works expenditure. If
Queensland, Victoria and N.S.W. decided to
abolish loans and set aside £1,000,000 a year out of
revenue for railways and other works, the evidence
of the above figures is that they could do it without
any increase of revenue and without being even
quite so economical as they wereinlß96. And if the
£1,000,000 a year for new public works was made
a first charge on the revenue—if it had to be paid
whatever else happened—the evidence of the
figures is that there is nothing at all to prevent
the Treasurers making the revenue that was left
cover the country’s necessities. They all did it
before, and they could do it again. As to why
this isn’t done —that is the country’s fault. When
the country demands economy it always does it
with a view to abolishing taxes —never with a
view to abolishing loans. When Victoria’s last
local loan was floated with such difficulty,
Premier ' Peacock practically shut up the
public-works policy of the State, and the
local press and politicians concurred, quite recog-
nising that to expect the Government to build
anything without loan funds was absurd,
and that the idea of reducing ordinary expendi-
ture and squeezing £500,000 or £1,000,000 a year
for public works out of ordinary revenue was quite
impossible. And almost immediately afterwards
a large section of the same press, and many of the
same politicians, started to demonstrate that it
was quite possible to cut down the ordinary ex-
penditure by £500,000 or £1,000,000 —not to reduce
the deficit, or provide for necessary public works,
but in order to cut down taxation, which is not at
all high in any case. When the country always
sees clearly that it is quite possible to cut down
expenditure so as to abolish taxes, and yet that it
is quite impossible to cut it down so as to abolish
loans, any real reform is next to hopeless.
Public Health and Individual Rights.
Some moneyed genius with a taste for research
might make a most interesting book by compiling
an account of all the good laws that have become
obsolete through the lack of a little human sym-
pathy and consideration. The thing that is not
built on human nature will perish. In all proba-
bility the things that are built on it will perish
also, but the other kind will perish first. Maoriland
has a law to the effect that no consumptive shall
be employed in the preparation of food—and the
law is a good one, and will do much to save life.
Quite recently a man who had been all his life
employed in the biscuit and confectionery trade
was found to be suffering from consumption, and
the Dunedin Health Department ordered that he
be dismissed. The order had to be obeyed, and,
through no fault of his own, the man (married and
with several young children) found himself reduced
from the comparative comfort of £3 per week to
utter destitution. He laid his ease before the
local Council, and all the Council could do was to
recommend him to the tender mercies of the
Charitable Aid Board. This is safeguarding
the Public Health, but it is doing it in
so barbarous a way that the law will become
unpopular and repulsive, and in the end
will be practically abrogated. No one will
supply the information that will lead to consump-
tives being suddenly pauperised. The thing is an
outrage, and the law is an outrage also. While
Eroviding for the safety of the public, it should
ave safeguarded the rights of the individual
sacrificed in the public interest. If Maoriland
had sanatoria for consumptives, and the
machinery for making the suddenly-dismissed
consumptive a pensioner until he was cured, it
could logically insist on him leaving work and
taking up his quarters in a healthy resort
till the cure was effected. A man’s first duty
is to his family—at least, nothing will pre-
vent him regarding matters in that light; his
duty to the public comes next, and where the
public insists on being considered first, it ought to
make provision accordingly. Meanwhile, the
man mentioned cannot be employed at the only
trade he knows, in Maoriland. He will drift
about trying to get some sort of occupation, and
spreading the germs of his disease, and the family
will suffer hardships that will probably develop
any latent tendencies it may have towards tuber-
culosis. For the safety of the community, the
suggested addition to the law is as necessary as
the law itself.

The Pearl-Pishing 1 Monopoly.
A letter from “ Sandy MThairson ” in the
North :
Your Sydney daily newspapers have been much exer-
cised during the last 10 or 12 days at the probable alleged
departure of the pearl-fishers from Thursday Island to
Merouke in Dutch New Guinea. Our Brisbane patriots,
Robert Philp and his brothers-in-law, James Olark and
his brothers-in-law, also Borns Philp and Co. of your
city, are getting terribly afraid of the Commonwealth.
Well they may be. According to Hon. John Douglas, of
Thursday Island, pearl-fishing employs 2032 men, and of
those 2032 only 65 are Europeans. There are 247 boats
licensed as pearl-fishing luggers, and no boat is allowed
to go on the ground to fish unless licensed. Early this
year there appeared a Government advt. in the Torres
Straits Pilot. That advt. announced that no more
licenses would be issued to shelling luggers as the grounds
were getting denuded of shell by the excessive working.
The yield of shell in Torres Straits falls and increases
according as the weather during the year is favorable for
working or the reverse. Of the 247 licensed shelling-
boats nearly 200 are owned or controlled by the syndi-
cates of which Burns Philp and Co., Premier Robert
Philp and his brothers-in-law, and James Clark and his
brothers-in-law are the leading and shining lights.
M'llwraitii and M‘Eacharn are the agents in London for
these enterprising monopolists, and get their commission.
Having this information before them the Australian
public need feel no surprise that, when the yield of
pearl-shell for 1901 was a trifle under that of 1900 (owing
to the unfavorable weather), Robert Philp and co. (the
Queensland Government) decided to issue no more
licenses for luggers to go upon the shelling ground. By
this adroit manoeuvre they created a monopoly for them-
selves in licenses. They have already driven out the
white working-man by surrounding him and his boat
with ten or twelve boats worked by the colored aliens,
and working on his patch of shell. Australian pearl-shelling
should give employment to between 2000 and 3000 men
of our own race and blood. The industry extends
from Cairns, in Queensland, to Roebourne, in Wes-
tralia. It produces a material worth nearly £300,000 per
annum, without the pearls. That part of it which is
worked from Thursday Island is in waters which are not
only in the area of the proclaimed Commonwealth, but
are between two shores, both of which belong to
the Commonwealth. The shelling-ground is between
British New Guinea on the north, and Australia on the
South. Where do the Dutch come in ? But what patriots
we have to be sure in Burns, Philp and Co., Robert
Philp and his brothers-in-law, etc. What patriots 1
Because they cannot fill up their shelling boats with the
scum of Manila, Singapore, Hongkong and Japan they
threaten to turn Dutchmen ! If the Commonwealth
Government is composed of statesmen, they will pass over
the letters of the Queensland Govt., ignore the opinions
of MTlwraitii, M'Eacharn and Co., and appoint a
Commission of their own Parliament to thoroughly
inquire into this, which is really a great Australian
industry. That Commission will, no doubt, find out why
it is that this industry, which 12 years ago gave employ-
ment to white divers, now gives employment to none.
That poor little paper, the Evening News, says : “ White
men cannot be expected to dive ! ” Indeed, why not ?
Because pearling monopolists do not want them to come
on the shelling ground, and will never have them until
they are made to have them. When next the election
for Senators in Australia is to the fore, let those who love
their country see to it that this pearl-shelling monopoly
is duly exposed, and that the would-be Senators are
asked—“ Why are white men kept out of the pearlshell
industry ? "
Victoria’s Alleged Parliamentary Reform
Movement.
Victoria would do well to look with a suspicious
eye on that great public demonstration in favor of
a reduction of its State Legislature until it knows
for certain who is running it, and is positive that
the round, red countenance of old Duncan Gillies
is not rising like a full moon behind the curtain.
At present it seems quite possible that the whole
proceeding is a large, stale fish drawn across the
scent in the Tory interest. The agitation arose
first among country property-holders (the same
gang of thieves which swindled the State so
shamefully over the irrigation business), and the
property-holding class appears to have been
largely in it all along. What is demanded
is a reduction in the dimensions of both
Houses —a bald reduction which will save a
little money, but do nothing else. With an
Assembly of 46 members and a Council of 23 there
is nothing to prevent the Council being as stupid,
as hostile to all reform, and as hopeless a snag in
the way of progress as it is now, when it is a dead
idiot of 48 members obstructing an Assembly of
95. At the last general election the people
demanded a popularly-elected Convention to
draft a complete new State Constitution
as the Federal Constitution was drafted.
It was offered them by the party in power,
and they demanded it in the only way
open to them—by returning that party with a
strong majority. They didn’t get their Conven-
tion because the Peacock party “ turned dog,”
but that makes no diffe ence in the moral aspect
of the case. They may demand it again at next
election with such energy that they will get it ;
and there is always the chance that the Conven-
tion might propose the abolition of the 48 Rich
Landlords, and insist on having only one
House of State Legislature, after the fashion of
Ontario, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British
Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and the
North West Territories in Canada. So it is a wise
proceeding now to draw the defunct whale of
strategy across the scent of progress by working
up a bogus public demand for a reduction of mem-
bership which will leave the House of Landlords
in the same impregnable position as before. It is
easy to do such things—2ooo people crying out at
public meetings, especially if the same man
attends several meetings, can make more row and
draw more attention than 50,000 people at the polls.
The dispossessed M’s.L.C. would lose nothing
material —not even their salaries, for they haven’t
any, nor their political ambitions, for the House
of Landlords is no road to the fulfilment of any
great political ambitions. The 23 Landlords could
preserve the interests of the property-holding class
quite as well as the 48, and prevent the imposition
of a really useful land-tax, and save the big estates,
and do all the other sins. And when once this
bogus reform was granted the Upper House would
meet any demands for real improvement by
saying, indignantly, “We have just reformed
ourselves; what more do you want?” Even
if the House of Landlords doesn’t want
to reduce its numbers it gains something by the
present agitation. Last election the fight was
between the party whioh wanted to construct a
new State Constitution by a popular Convention
and the party which didn’t. The former won ;it
took a good deal of political manoeuvring and axe-
grinding to cheat it out of the fruits of its'vic-
tory, and there is no certainty that it might
not be even more difficult to cheat it next time.
If the reformers can be divided there will be three
parties at next election—the Convention Party,
a large section of which hopes to see the Legis-
lative Council utterly abolished; the Bogus
Economy Party, which proposes to reduce both
Houses without reforming the dreadful Council in
the least, but which may capture a lot of the re-
formers’ votes by its cry of economy; and the
Tired, or Ultra-Tory Party, which believes
in letting things remain as they are. By
dividing the reformers the Tired Party
may control the situation, especially as it
will be supported by many members who get
in on the reform-ticket but who hate to see profane
hands laid on the sacred ark of their billets.
They will always have the excuse that the Voice
of the People, by reason of the split between the
Convention Party and the Reduction Party, is
uncertain and unintelligible. And when the
billets are at stake the anxiety of legislators not to
rush into any hasty misinterpretation of the Voice
of the People amounts to a disease.
Our Alien Inclusion Act.
A Queensland sugar co. has just received a con-
signment of 23 Japanese. They were landed in
Townsville and sent on to the co.’s works. Another
batch of 53 is on the road to the co.’s plantation,
and is expected to arrive next month. The Aliens
Immigration Restriction Act seems to be almost
absolutely a dead letter, particularly in Queens-
land. A Federal Parliament return gives the
following interesting figures as to the rejection
and admission of colored people since the passing
of the Immigration Restriction Act:
Number Number
Admitted. Rejected.
N.S.W. .. 12 6
Vic 70 9
Q 274 14
S.A none 2
W.A 28 1
Tas none none
Totals .. 386 32
It seems to be a very efficacious way indeed
for promoting a piebald Australia. If the
administration of the Act is to be on these lines
it will be necessary to demand a measure at once
for the absolute exclusion of colored aliens.
Australia took the present Act “on the honor of
Mr. Barton,” on the understanding that the
educational subterfuge was intended to more
thoroughly exclude objectionable immigrants.
And now it seems to be a subterfuge to admit
them, and is being used even to over-ride the old
Chinese Exclusion Acts.

Now that the first shout of enthusiasm has died
away people begin to notice certain large possi-
bilities about the Anglo- Jap. alliance. The treaty
provides that if either Britain or Japan is at war
with one State the other may remain neutral—-it
may join in if it pleases, but it isn’t bound to do
so. But if Japan is at war with two States then
Britain is pledged to join in, and vice versa. Japan
badly wants to fight Russia —it wants the island
of Saghalien, which it always regarded as a Russian
steal, and it desires to spread Jappy influence in
Corea, and it wants other things as well. But it
has great doubts about its ability to fight Russia
single-handed. Under the new treaty, however,
if it can provoke a war with Russia and Russia’s
ally, France, then Britain is pledged to declare
war against both of them. And it would be much
easier for Japan to fight both Russia and France
with Britain’sassistancethan tofight Russia single-
handed. The little brown Jap.’s best chance to get
level with its enemy is to bring about a war
with him and some other Power while the treaty
lasts. This is where the really gratifying view of
the case comes in—for Britain. Its new brown
friend feels sure that it will have to fight Russia
one day or another, and to-day is the best day for
the purpose. Of course it is a misfortune that so
massive a Power as France is the only other one
that it seems easy to drag in; Russia and Switzer-
land would make the ideal combination, if that
could only be brought about. The Jap difficulty
is that Russia is a State with a vast capacity for
patience. It will probably pub a good deal of the
Jap’s arrogance quietly on its slate until the
Anglo-Jap alliance dies a natural death, and then
ask the Jap person what he meant by it.
It was solemnly proposed the other day by the
Sydney Morning Herald that if the Federal
capital were fixed near Bombala 80,000 acres
should be set apart as a Federal territory. Eighty
thousand acres ! 125 square miles ! Say a bit of
land eleven miles each way. The Federal
Government might be sole ground-landlord inside
that space, but the increased land values, created
by the expenditure of the people’s money, would
spread far beyond these narrow limits, and the
private landlord outside would be there to collect
the proceeds. Nothing short of 5000 square miles
should be set aside for this great national purpose,
and N.S.W., with its 310,700 square miles, can
spare that area, especially in a desolate region
where you may follow the high road for 35
miles without coming to a public-house, and for
10 miles without seeing a house at all.
Furthermore, it is essential that the Federal terri-
tory should have its own port, if there is one handy,
and be sole ground-landlord there and all around.
Australia has now the sort of chance that comes
once in a thousand years to try a splendid and
profitable experiment in land nationalisation,
and if the land-grabbers’ papers succeed in their
efforts to pen up the Federal city on a stuffy little
plot of ground for the temporary benefit of a few
local earth-owners, Australia will regret the mis-
take for all time.

Sydney D.T. has discovered “ the crying need for
retrenchment” in N.S.W. (it hasn’t suggested,
however, the retrenchment of abolishing the sub-
sidies of free postage and free special railway
trains to the morning papers), and some of the
facts and figures which it quotes in regard to the
civil service are certainly remarkable. All the
branches of the service, comparing the figures for
1897-8 with those of 1901-2, show a distinct increase
in cost, ranging from 18 per cent, in one depart-
ment to 30 per cent, in others. The increases are
due chiefly to staff additions and the raising of
staff salaries; and in all cases the percentage of
increase may be fairly called unreasonable and ex-
cessive. On an average, the cost of the civil ser-
vice has increased by nearly 25 per cent, in four
years, whilst the population has only increased 6
per cent. Yet, during the Reid regime, there
was formed, with a loud flourish of trumpets, a
Public Service Board, which was for all future
time to secure an economical and effective civil
service ! That Board does not seem to have been
a brilliant success.

The Federal Coinage Committee has decided that
the Commonwealth should have a metrical coin-
age, the sovereign being divided into 10 florins,
the florin into 10 dimes, and the dime into 10
cents. The committee certainly hasn’t done
much. If it was proposed to adopt the dollar of
100 cents, this country would get a simple metrical
coinage which would bring it in line with Canada,
the U.S., Chili and other countries, instead of
starting out on its own and adding another to the
over-numerous coinages already existing. And a
metrical system of weights and measures to re-
place the 50 or so tangled and incomprehensible
tables now existing, is far more essential than a
metrical coinage. The ideal system would be a
uniform metrical coinage, beginning with the
sovereign and working downwards, and a uniform
metrical system of weights and measures, for the
whole British Empire, which empire now has so
many coinages and weights and measures that it
is just about crazy. Supposing 400,000,000 people
were using the same methods there would then be
a chance that the rest of the globe would join in
by degrees. Perhaps if Australia refused to send
any more contingents till this matter was attended
to some good might result.
The Freetrade Brisbane Courier, after declaring
for years that Protection means high prices and
Freetrade means low ones, and that the consumer
pays the duty, and more than the duty, thus (27th
March) gives the show away :
The great bulk of the oil consumed in Australia by the
working-man is controlled by the Standard Oil Trust.
When it became likely that kerosene would be placed on
the freelist, merchants still hastened to purchase in bond.
Such a course may seem absurd, since many of our readers
will assume that the price would be the same, if the duty
were taken off, whether the oil were in or out of bond.
Why did not buyers of large parcels take their time ?
Simply because it had been rumored that the Standard
Oil people were preparing to obtain a good slice of the
lifted duty. That is to say, the duty may be taken off
kerosene, but the price of the commodity will not neces-
sarily fall in proportion. The working-man will not bene-
fit so much as the monopolists who control the oil-market.
They will sell their oil as if the duty, or a good slice of it,
remained.
The Courier thus suddenly discovers that Pro-
tection doesn’t necessarily mean increased prices,
and that the seller sometimes pays the duty. If
he does that in a case like that of kerosene, where
there is no serious possibility of any local industry
to compete with him, how much more is he likely
to do it in the matter of (say) boots where he has
to compete with local industry? And why does
the Courier imagine a vain thing, and fancy that
it is a Freetrade paper when it is liable to
symptoms akin to the above ?
Freetrader Willis, of N.S.W., vehemently
denounced the match-industry in the House of
Reps, as one which distributed £5OOO a year in
wages and lost the Treasury £12,000 a year in
duty on imported matches. In his view it was
another of these Unprofitable Industries that the
Shoddy party is always girding at, and by the
Freetrade theory such an industry is a loss of
£7OOO a year to the country. By Willis’s own
showing, if there was no local match-industry the
country would have to pay about £50,000 a year
more for imported matches, and if the Treasury
got £12,000 out of that the country would still
have £38,000 a year more to pay to some foreign
community. Also, it would have 50 or 100 more
unemployed citizens on its hands. Fifty or 100
more unemployed and £50,000 more going out of
the country in order to provide £12,000 revenue,
are the Freetrader’s idea of economy. The foreign
manufacturers’ hireling says the Australian
buyer pays the duty and then, when the
people don’t pay it but manufacture for
themselves, he reckons the duty they don’t pay
as so much dead loss. Even wheat-growing and
cattle-rearing are Unprofitable Industries now by
this theory, for if all the wheat-fields were burned
and all the cattle killed off, Australia would have
to import its wheat and beef, and then the Trea-
sury would get the duty. By raising wheat and
cattle the country, according to all solid Foreign-
trade theories, loses two or three millions every
year now. The same applies to sugar, potatoes,
beer, wine, &e. It is a beautiful argument when
you come to inspect it closely, and should have a
special lunatic asylum built to put it in lest it gets
lost.
_
Sydney Telegraph, discussing the latest British
move towards Protection, the imposition of corn
and flour duties, prints interviews with prominent
Sydney merchants. One is allowed to say this —
It does not follow that the people in England will have
to pay more for their bread because of this duty. When
we start exporting, I take it that these charges of sd. a
cwt. on flour and 3d. on wheat will be added to our
present charges.
Another remarks—
The new duty will be a very good thing for the Home
people. Of course it will greatly assist the British millers,
as well as the home farmers, whose industry has been at
a low ebb for many years past.
Another (with a very unkind preface indeed):
“You can talk a lot of twaddle, but it all comes back
to this : A duty has to be reckoned, by shippers as an
extra charge. If the price of wheat is £1 9s. 6d. to-day,
we have got to reckon the duty as an extra charge, or
else the English buyer has got to pay £llos. 6d., or some-
thing extra to make up for the charges. It is probable
that we will have to accept at least half of the duty, and
the British consumer will pay the rest.”
The JD.T. chose its own experts and put them in
the box, and their evidence was: (1) that the
foreign producer, and not the English consumer,
will pay perhaps the whole, and certainly at least
the half, of the protective duty on corn and flour
imposed by England ; (2) that the duties will be a
very good thing for the British farmer. And that
is the whole case for a protective tariff in a nut-
shell. One doesn’t expect, however, to see it so
succinctly expressed in the Freetrade Sydney
D.T.

The Senate, in a fit of aberration, amended portion
of the Public Service Bill, and struck out the clause
that provided for a minimum-wage in the Govern-
ment service, because it would increase the ex-
penditure by £40,000 a year, which ‘ ‘ the Common-
wealth cannot afford.” If this is right, why send
contingents to South Africa? The Post-office,
which is under Drake’s control, is badly in need
of a minimum-wage, and for long it has been known
to the public as a sweating-den and criminal-maker.
Mail drivers who have been in the service from 13
to 20 years get £B4 a year. Operators, some of
whom have worked themselves up from telegraph-
boys, and have been in the department doing
nerve-wearing work for 20 and 25 years, are getting
£BO a year ! Postmasters’ wages vary from £2 a
week to £6, and in some of the city offices they are
drawing the' magnificent wage of £2 10s. a week.
Letter-carriers fare worst of all, as most of them
only get £75 a year. The department grades
officials as junior-postmasters, junior-operators,
&c. This system makes the public think that they
are not first-class hands, but such is not the case ;
it only means that they are receiving junior
salaries. Many of the juniors are married, and
have growing families to keep, to do which they
must solve some pretty stiff problems. Parliament
could have afforded to pay the minimum-wage
proposed if it had not thrown away a lot of postal
revenue by its suppression of Tattersall. Hav-
ing suppressed Tattersall, and sacrificed the
revenue, it didn’t say that it was therefore unable
to pay its own members a living wage—not much.
It decided that it couldn’t pay its employees a
living wage.
The fact that the present agitation for a reduction
in the cost of Government in Victoria was started
by a mass meeting of indignant farmers at Kya-
bram recalls the fact that the Victorian Treasury
would be some hundreds of thousands richer but
for the shameful dishonesty of the agriculturists
thereabouts. When Deakin was a Minister
in Victoria he was got at by one M‘Coll,
a canal faddist, who talked him into expending
much money in extensive irrigation works on the
River Goulburn. These works are certainly as
perfect in their way as anything can be. All the
inhabitants of the districts around were in ecstacies
and meetings were held which eulogised the noble
and patriotic action of the Government. There
was no difficulty in getting the landed proprietors
to promise to further the gigantic scheme by
having their property irrigated, and when the
works were completed, applications for water
poured in by the score, the grateful applicants
agreeing enthusiastically to pay the very reason-

able price demanded. The water poured over the
fields, the crops were splendid, and land became
quadrupled in value, but when payment of the
interest fell due, Kyabram and its surroundings
practically refused to pay a copper. And they
kept on that way. This game went on year after

A cleaned and brightened theatre was
Sydney Royal when it re-opened on Saturday, after
a long retirement from public life, and the audi-
ence was well-disposed and quite prepared to
speak kindly to the new actress. Still, it wasn’t
such an audience as might have been expected
for the opening performance of a new star,
especially when two theatres are empty, and
opposition is at the lowest ebb. This writer has
a. dark suspicion that the public is growing dead
tired of “As You Like It.” There are six
Shakespearian works whose names hang with
the persistence of an ancient tarred malefactor
in chains outside the playhouses of the English-
speaking world : “ Hamlet,” “ Merchant of
Venice,” “As You Like It,” “Romeo and
Juliet,” “Othello,” and “Macbeth” —the last
two hanging with a shade less persistence, it may
be, than the rest. There are a few others which
appear occasionally, and a number that are almost
as forgotten as what Caractacus had for dinner.
Even assuming that the public isn’t hungering for
“ Henry IV.” or “Henry VI.” or “Henry VIII.,”
there are a dozen good Shakespearian plays
which are almost as rare as the poems of Edward
VII., and if they are not quite up to thestandard of
the weary six, still the public might prefer to see
a second-rate play for the first time rather than a
first-rate one for the 120th. A good manager
with a good co., and a good star, and a good
theatre, who announces a season of the forgotten
plays of Shakespeare, may make a lot of money, or
he may lose it, but either way he will be a public
benefactor.
* * * •
Miss Janet Waldorf who perpetrated the
frequent Rosalind at the Royal on Saturday, is a
clever actress with a good figure and a bright
capable face —also a rather hard voice. She is not
an overwhelming star, but she supplies a pleasing
version of the lady with the doublet and hose, and
the audience accepts her in a kindly spirit, with-
out absolutely losing its head in the struggle.
This agreeable visitor is supported by a company
which answers the same description as herself. It
maintains a fair level of excellence, and treats
Shakespeare with the respect due to his age. H.
H. Vincent, back after a long and regrettable
absence, gives a strong rendering of Jaques the
philosopher, and delivers the famous soliloquy
about the disadvantages of being old in a highly
creditable fashion. Norval M‘Gregor is a bright,
boyish-looking Orlando, and Dale Revenall is a
brawny Charles, and between them they produce
one of the most realistic wrestling-matches ever
seen on the Australian stage. As a rule Charles
knows something of wrestling while Orlando
knows about enough of it to struggle with
a caterpillar, and Charles toils visibly to do
himself credit, and yet let Orlando win, and
to conceal his deep longing to take up the
incompetent Orlando and break the orchestra or
the duke with him. In the present case, however,
Orlando contrives to look as if he were keeping
Charles fully employed and is not a person to
be thrown at any duke with impunity. Of the two
dukes, Hamilton Stewart makes the one look
wicked on the throne in long, red clothes, while
Austin Melford makes the other look benevolent
in the forest in long, brown boots. Miss Gleeson
is a clever Audrey ; Miss Ruth Mackay is only
moderate as Celia; Edmund Gwenn is a high-class
Touchstone, and J. B. Atholwood, who is a young
man with a great capacity for old man characters,
does the desolate part of old Adam most com-
mendably. Adam was the original Dan’l Jaikes
of dramatic literature, bestowing on his young
master in the hour of calamity the penny he had
saved up against a rainy day. But Adam is a
profoundly serious old man, and if he had met
Bodger later on in the forest he would probably
have failed to extract any humor out of the in-
cident. Besides, in the indefinite land where
Shakespeare’s dukes hang out, Bodger would be
impossible.

The present Shakespearian season lasts
only a fortnight, and then the Comic Opera Co.
returns to Sydney to play the “Runaway Girl.”

Once we grasp the fact with both ears (and
provided our minds are free from inter-State jea-
lousy) that Amy Castles does not come out here
as a “finished singer,” we shall appreciate
her singing. Amy’s voice to-day, after less
than three years’ European cultivation, shows
what study has done for her in an art which, like
chess, can never be wholly learned, because its
possibilities are endless. Thursday of last week
the re-captured bird was let loose in Sydney
Town Hall, where she limed the souls of over
three thousand willing listeners with her sweet,
bright voice.
* * • •
At the Castles’ first concert, the star’s
contributions were Ophelia’s mad scene, and in
place of advertised “Jerusalem,” the music of
which had been forgotten, she warbled David’s
“ O Dieu Brahma ! ” and her share of the duet,
“ Parigi o cara,” from “ Traviata for encores —
“Home, Sweet Home,” and an Irish folk-song of
eerie, crooning melody. The gem of the second
concert was her (Coenen’s) “Spring,” and the
Waltz Song from “Romeo and Juliet” was not
two scintillations behind. In the duets with
Dani, the well-trained tenor does not dominate
the girl—their voices dovetail, and the audience
accepts her with him naturally; any weakness in
her would have been pathetically shown up by his
strength. A quality of the great artist she has—
she sings pianissimo, a whisper that may be heard
at the farthest end of the hall; yet her fortissimo
is not a shout. The public, which has insisted
on starring Dani, is as mad as ever on its only
Carlo’s high C. Miss Una Bourne, an ascetic-
looking young pianiste of great nerve, plays well
and satisfies those who .can -stand the piano as a
solo instrument. Miss Nora M‘Kay, a Queens-
land violiniste, has some genius, and if she could
only avoid making a double chin with the south
end of her fiddle, fastidious persons would be
grateful. Miss Dalrymple and Mr. Baritone
Needham are always well received and encored,
and when Amy and Carlo are on the programme
it is no small honor to be asked to remain in the
road longer than is absolutely necessary.
** * *
The “ Span of Life,” despite the old age
that is coming upon it, hangs across its African
chasm at Sydney Lyceum with all the vigor of
youth. One reason for its continuance, besides its
span and its chasm, probably lies in the fact that
it departs here and there from the old, dry-rotted
canons of melodrama. For instance, the incrimi-
nating document looms largely in Act 1., but it
isn’t found in the coat-pocket of the innocent
hero, because the son of the lady who put
it there abstracts it, unknowing that Ma used it
merely as a trap, and being led away by his own
ungovernable passion for property. So the packet
is found in the right person’s pocket for once in a
way, and the boy who ate the poisoned grapes
clinches the matter by telling on Ma before he
dies near the footlights. The lighthouse-scene
goes as well as usual, and Miss Ross’s rather
springy Robin Redbreast walk is conspicuous
when she accepts her dowry in an off-hand
manner from the villain without counting it, and
takes it along to Baker in the lighthouse just
when a storm is rising and it is dangerous to be
out. In real life even a girl in love doesn’t take
all her worldly wealth to a wet lighthouse in bad
weather, but knows enough to take it instead to a
dry bank. The heroine of melodrama, however, is
blessed with a lack of sense which is beyond
words, and she falls in as a consequence, and then
she puts on a white frock and lets her hair down
and reposes her trust in Providence.
** * *
“Dr. Bill” was still on the stage at
Sydney Empire when this issue went to press,
though if the Cosgroves adhere to their present
intentions something new will take place by the
time it reaches the public. The Empire is an
erratic little place and likewise a law unto itself,
and it may keep up to its intentions or it
may not. “What Women Wed” is the piece
which is to succeed “Dr. Bill.” Whether it is
meant to show the kind of woman who marries,
or the kind of object a woman is liable to get
married to, is a matter regarding which the writer
offers no opinion. Either way a large subject
is opened up.
** * *
The new variety programme at Sydney
Palace on Saturday night lasted until 11.40 p.m.,
and kept the bulk of the audience until then —
strong proof of its attractiveness. On Monday a
merciful management compressed things consider-
ably, and people got away by 11. As a further
reform “ the little Dartos” might be sent home to
bed, and a fairly strict rule against encores enforced.
Perhaps the chief feature of the new programme
is the revelation of Miss Rose Sutherland’s
versatility as a dancer and a comedy singer.
Bunth and Rudd are again at the Palace, and the
unctuous humor of Bunth is now shown in two
“turns.” “The animated song-sheet ” proves to
be a fresher and more amusing novelty than
usual. Salerno still juggles wonderfully, and
does some new feats, which are quite good enough
to rank with his old ones. The public gets a lot
for its money at Sydney Palace just now : a
comic-opera in tabloid form, a compressed circus,
a juggling show, and a minstrel entertainment-
all of them good.
** * *
Kitty, the horse-riding Tiger, and “ Fred
Grey,” the Boxing Kangaroo, are the two greatest
attractions of Fitzgeralds’ new programme. Fred
boxes at first in rather a ladylike manner, but
warms up after awhile and gets his opponent’s
head in chancery several times, and lets out at him
furiously. During the intervals his weird features
are duly, fanned with a white towel, a proceeding
which he takes in a resentful spirit, desiring to
hoof the attentive one. When he shows a dis-
position to use his. large hinder feet in defiance of
rule viii., sub-section 127, he is promptly bundled
into his triumphal car and taken away in a
wondering frame of mind. Kitty goes through
her part with more spirit than the lion named
Solomon, but to less imposing effect. The six
white broncos who yawn at the audience make a
pleasing picture on the whole, and the Olympians,
Harry Cardello and Miss Katie, are cleverly
imitated by clown Duckworth ; the hurricane
hurdle act of Miss F. Bartolo brings in the usual
hoop of fire and almost-flaming lady, and the
other new items include the wonderful Cycle
Whiz by various whirling wheelers, who whiz with
great fury, and the grand equestrian spectacle,
“The Harvest Home.” They really do have a
Harvest Home in England, because they have
harvests there. Here, where the harvest consists
often of a bush-fire and an appeal to the Govern-
ment for seed wheat, the habit has never taken
root.
** * *
“ The cake-walk ” is perhaps seen at its
best in the performance of the Perman trio at
Sydney Tivoli; and seeing the cake-walk, at its
best, shows how completely eccentricity has dis-
placed gracefulness in dancing. The ebullition
of savage good spirits, not the languorous grace of
feeling, has to be expressed by the successful
dancer : there is no poetry of dancing, only a very
rugged prose nowadays. Peggy Pryde, the
vivacious, is playing a short return season at this
theatre, and shares the favor of the audience with
Callaghan and Mack, Lydia Titus and the Jack-
son family.
*# * *
Clement Wragge frantically waving the
Union Jack in Rev. Walters’ Australian Church,
Sydney, on Sunday night was resented by many
as a burlesque both on politics and religion. Mr.
Wragge lectured in the Exchange Hotel hall
during the week to a big and remunerative
audience, which came fully prepared to be inter-
ested, but soon had its enthusiasm damped by the
speaker’s puerilities. Mr. Wragge should get
his discourses severely edited by some smart man.
** * *
“Dorothy,” even in its rough revival at
Her Majesty’s (Melb.), is a welcome contrast to
the latter-day musical comedy, which loses all
coherence after 10 p.m. and lends itself to new
interpolations as it goes along. “ Dorothy ” has
suffered no changes for the better or worse all
these 15 Australian years. The present faults and
virtues of the opera are just what they were when
natty little Leonora Braham played the heroine,
and Elton used to fall down the staircase of Squire
Bantam’s ancestral hall. Composer Cellier’s
charming melodiesdeserved a more ingenious story,
likewise brighter dialogue, but the librettist (B. C.
Stephenson) can at least be credited with an
attempt to do the right thing. The show is a
harmony of music, color and character. There
were suggestions of rustic romance, top boots
and old fashions in Cellier’s work, and Stephen-
son, having to suit the ‘ book ’ to the score
borrowed his main idea from “She Stoops to
Conquer,” and gave “Dorothy” a congenial
atmosphere. The plot is not so absurd in concep-
tion as in the working-out of details. Two men
meet the same two girls in each of the three acts,
and are supposed to regard them as three different
pairs of girls, which is a difficult supposition to
swallow when one of the girls talks with Grace
Palotta’s foreign accent. Also, the bogus burglary
at the hall of the bucolic Bantam is a clumsily
constructed fraud. These things might have been
made less foolish, but the same complaint applies
to the plot of many other tuneful operas with a lot
more force.
• * * *
“ Dorothy,” as produced at Her Majesty’s
for a nine-nights’ season, is a sufficiently lively
and well-staged reminder of the bygone period
when Melbourne expected better performances,
and got Jem. Perhaps the public was spoilt by
the Firm in those times. A new, unspoilt public
is springing up to offer atonement for the hyper-
critical snortings of its progenitors, and
“Dorothy” seemed to please it on Saturday.
All the same, the performance was musically
sick and dramatically weak for the most part.
Miss Florence Young and Kenningham plus a
crude chorus, represented the vocal strength of
the show. The music of the name part is too
high for Miss Young, but she makes it go and her
brilliant top-note seizes every opportunity to
shine. Moreover she is a spirited, buxom Dorothy.
Miss Palotta is a nice Grace who can’t sing satis-
factorily ; and Miss Maud Chetwynd fails to the
same extent, or even more so. Bathurst, the
baritone, will no doubt improve on his Saturday
“ form.” He sang out of tune, as a rule, and his
difficult ballad, “ Queen of my Heart, To-Night,”
was not a work of art. Lauri, as Lurcher, is not
quite at his best, though Lauri in any case
amounts to a success.
* * * Hi
At the Princess’s, where the Broughs are
drawing very near to their absolutely final farewell,
the wild narrative of “Dr. Bill” is putting in
six nights, not because the management wanted
to perpetrate that frivolous deed, but because
“ Dr. Bill ’’ looked likely to find favor with many
erring citizens who stop away from serious
comedies. Judging from the medium size of
Saturday’s audience Brough might as well have
devoted his penultimate week to a heavier task.
“Dr. Bill,” although it wears well and remains
fairly funny for its age, is not a cyclonic absurdity.
The situations require a more impossible arrange-
ment of doors leading into next rooms than is
usual in newer farces, and the red-dressed girl
of giddy tendencies thrusting her society upon
the man who has now taken unto himself a
mother-in-law and a higher code of morality, is
rather an exhausted interloper. Nevertheless,
the kangaroo dance, which results from the arrival
of the scarlet woman, was hailed with joy on
Saturday, and the house roared at Brough and
Miss Temple as though their historic hop were a
revelation of unsuspected skill. The versatile
Robert ought to disguise himself once again in
war-paint and feathers, and give them his Red
Indian dance from “ Princess Toto ” —but no
matter. On Saturday (26th), “A Village Priest”
will be revived for two performances only ; after
which “ The Liars ” and “ Mrs. Tanqueray ” may
be expected, unless the advt. decrees otherwise.
** * *
“ Greed of Gold ” continues to hold the
ensanguined stage of Melb. Royal, and the man
who got struck dumb on a mill-wheel is grunting
and gesticulating as before. He grunts loudest
when an artless small boy wants to pay the princi-
pal villain a shilling for an attempted murder,
but he utters no grunts whatever whilst acting
as ballet-master for his sister’s bridesmaids.
Probably the dumb gentleman’s emotion at
this proud moment is too deep for grunts.
He merely waves a handkerchief towards
the ballet at the request of his mother,
or his aunt, who presently retires to her
bedroom on the ground floor, and dies a violent
death. Meanwhile the bride and bridegroom and
other people have gone upstairs to roost, and as
they don’t come to any harm the moral of the
drama is obvious. Never have your sleeping
apartment on the ground floor when danger
threatens, and there never was a melodrama in
which it didn’t threaten. Another fatal mistake
is the habit of keeping one’s cash and papers (in-
cluding the last will and testament) in a room
where somebody invariably enters from the garden
as soon as the light is turned down. Hundreds of
wealthy parents and uncles have died to slow
music in consequence of this habit.

At Melb. Bijou the converted capitalist in
gaudy raiment is still heaping floral tributes on a
beauteous Henrietta. Also the man of many
dollars asserts his ancient right to kiss a tall,
attractive niece every evening till further notice,
and what with one girl and the other the Wrong
Mr. Wright ought to be happy. Twenty years oi
unflagging energy in the wholesale liquor
business bring a lot of consolation for that
healthy American citizen when he decides to
let himself off the chain. Probably “Wrong
Mr. Wright” was not intended as a sermon
for the young’, nevertheless it enforces tha
solemn, unpoetic truth that everything in woman-
hood comes to the millionaire who waits. Wright
is a stout, bald-headed joke of the toughest com-
mercial description, yet at a time of life when tha
average married man is a mere abandoned hulk on
the ocean of social life, Wright floats his richly-
upholstered pleasure yacht, and Roxy Barton
rushes the position of first mate. Also, he is
privileged to gaze on the awful spinster whom he
didn’t marry in the dim long ago, and the spec-
tacle of what he missed adds greatly to his
happiness.

Fagan and Byron, the latest arrivals at
Rickards’s, are a nimble Hibernian male who
bursts forth in a violet-colored suit, and a delect-
able little lady whose costumes are even more
frequent and fanciful. They sing alternately,
assisted by a wondrous gramophone which repeats
the refrain, and they dance together, more or less.
First impression of Miss Byron and her Fagan are
favorable rather than superlative. Colby and
Way, together with the stuffed figure who implores
Colby to place Way in the box, are back at the
Opera House, the other people being as they were
last week.

(26th) afternoon, when the admirers of those

a symphonic overture by August Siede will be
sandwiched between pieces by Wagner and
Beethoven.

Adelaide Royal replaced “San Toy” by
“The Runaway Girl.” J. C. Williamson ran
over to see one night of each piece, and found
them going very strong. Rose Musgrove played
the maid instead of San ; Lilian Digges playing
heroine instead of San’s maid ; but the latter’s
voice is hardly strong enough for leading parts.
Similarly, Chas. Trood came down from the
Emperor of China’s throne to take juvenile lead.
The Jubilee Singers, who have been giving hymns
at the Town Hall, have now moved in, with
a (presumably sinful) programme “specially
arranged for the patrons of the Royal.” Nellie
Stewart, in “Old Drury,” follows immediately.
The Tivoli (under manager Leete) has a strong
programme, with Derenda and Breen, the Lund-
greens’ ladder, and Winton (and M’Ginty) at the
head of it ; also Worttwell and Emily Lyndale,
two English artists just off the boat.

State revenues and other financial matters to
end of March :
New South Wales (9 months to 31st March).

Increase.. £116,456 .. £228,085 .. £111,629
The See-O’Sullivan Government, however, makes things
look a little better by including as revenue the rents of a
huge block of properties which it has taken over but not
paid for, and by not including as expenditure the interest
that has accrued up to date on the unpaid purchase
money— that it gaily paid out of loans. And by that
simple, crude, primitive dodge the See-O’Sullivan Govern-
ment makes things appear like this :
New South Wales (9 months to 31st March).
Revenue (Rents of
Resumed Area of Ordinary

Increase.. £241,369 .. £228,085
Decrease £13,284
The real deficit, if the accounts were treated on an honest
basis, is £111,629 more than it was at this date last year,
though by the Government’s disreputable dodge it is
made to look £13,214 less.
Loan expenditure shows up in this fashion:

The process of paying for the resumed property is lament-
ably slow, and the See-O’Sullivan policy makes it pay to
be slow. If a property taken over yields, say, £lO,OOO a
year in net rental, and the interest on the purchase-
money payable to the previous owner from the date of
resumption till his claim is settled also runs to
£lO,OOO a year, and the Government sticks to its
present discreditable dodge of using the £lO,OOO
rent as revenue and paying the £lO,OOO interest
out of loan, it certainly suits it to be slow. If the
matter hangs fire for one year, the Government is
able to treat £lO,OOO of other people’s money as clear
revenue ; if payment is postponed for three years it gets
the benefit of £30,000. In the latter case, of course,
£30,000 instead of £lO,OOO is unjustifiably added to the
public debt, but a small thing like that isn’t calculated
to trouble the See Government much.

On the surface of things, Queensland has improved.
But the expenditure for 1901 included a loan of

with the S’African war, and the revenue for 1902
included the repayment of the same, so as far as

Queensland’s own revenue and expenditure are concerned,
this year is £118,899 worse than last. Loan expenditure
(£865,201 for the nine months) is £60,808 more
than it was for the corresponding period y ea F;
Another deficit of very close on £500,000 is
practically certain, and £BOO,OOO has been talked
about, yet the imbecile Philp Ministry makes no
effort to stop the drift by imposing land and income
taxes, or by other means. It is waiting for something to
turn up, yet what it hopes or imagines can turn up passes
comprehension. The fall in revenue is solely owing to
the abolition of border duties and to the fact that postal
revenue (and the corresponding expenditure) are no
longer included in the State balance-sheet. The railway
revenue has improved, and promises to be very nearly the
largest Queensland ever collected. Dividend tax for the Dine
months is nearly £3OOO better than in the corresponding
period of last year ; totalisator tax has increased £100i;
license revenue, £2OOO ; railways (as already mentioned),
£44,000 ; and miscellaneous revenue has improved £92,000.
Barring a drop of £650 in land revenue the improvement
is an all-round one. The revenue, in fact, bids fair to be
the best Queensland has ever received from its purely
State sources of income, and the Philp Government is in
a fair way to have a £500,000 deficit despite this fact.
The policy of waiting till the biggest revenue on the
State’s record grows £500,000 bigger in order. to put
things straight is a hopeless business. There is more
likely to be a fall than a rise, and if ends can’t be made
to meet now the only remedy is more taxation.
Victoria’s revenue for the nine months to 31st
March, 1902, was £5,208,072 as compared with £5,495,998
up to same date last year, a decline of £287,926. The
purely State sources of revenue have increased by £94,523
but the fact that postal receipts no longer appear in the
State balance-sheet creates a large apparent decrease, in
the total. Still Peacock is relieved of the corresponding
postal expenditure, so his position ought to be good
enough. In the absence of any statement of expenditure,
however, this is mere conjecture.

The March revenue in Tasmania was £4424 more
than for March, 1901, so things look a little better for the
moment.

Tasmania’s politicians still show the same old hopeless-
ness of spirit over their financial situation. Philip Fysh
now says that by the end of the five years book-keeping
period the island will have accumulated £750,000 of
deficits, which will have to be added to the permanent
debt. During the five years book-keeping period an ac-
count is k°pt for each State, and each gets back the
revenue t supplied, less its exact share of the Federal
expenditure. At the end of that time, Tasmanian poli-
ticians hope for a new arrangement by which the island
will get more than its exact share, and be put in a con-
dition of affluence at somebody else’s loss. The favorite
idea is that, after five years are up, the surplus will be
divided at so much per inhabitant, and that .is quite pos-
sible. But the event may not come off. If it does come
off, it may leave Tasmania very much where it is now,
for, with the increase of local production brought about
by the abolition of border tariff, imports and customs
revenue are bound to decrease, and a division of the sur-
plus according to population in 1908 may not give Tas-
mania any more than the present method yields in 1902.
And if the new method does give it, say, £30,000 a year
more, the interest on the £750,000 of deficits which P.
Fysh proposes adding to the public debt will abont
swallow it up and leave the deficit as large as ever. Any-
how, Fysh can’t expect any new tariff arrangement to
give Tasmania £150,000 a year more, and that is what, he
says that it wants. So Tasmania had better face its diffl
culty now, and start that State lottery.

Westralia still collects its inter-State duties, so it stands
in a different position from its neighbors. And its sur-
plus is created in a great measure by cutting down the
public works expenditure—the part of it that is paid out
of revenue, not the part that is paid out of loans.

Decrease £331,856
The disaster is worse than it looks, in this sense : Only
£5OOO of the decline in the receipts is owing to loss of
customs revenue under the Federal tariff, and £181,350
of it arises from the transfer of the post-office revenue
(and expenditure) to the Federal accounts. This means
that the State’s own sources of revenue have dried up to
the extent of £145,000 in nine months. Railway revenue
has gone down £95,000 through the depression at Broken
Hill, the place which has done so much in recent years to
keep Jenkins’ unlucky State afloat. Land-tax, income-
tax, stamps, licences, probate duties, land revenue—in
fact, almost everything has fallen unanimously. With a
bad harvest, the second largest debt per head in the
world, nearly a million of old deficits still unpaid, the
profits which it should have made out of the Adelaide
tramways—almost the only promising spec, that hascome
its way of late years—jobbed away to Snow, with no
minerals worth mentioning, and little coal, and, conse-
quently, poor manufacturing prospects, with a dismally
barren" and waterless country, and a Jenkins, the pros-
pect could hardly be worse.

The row between the Broken Hill municipal
council and the mines over the amount of the mines rates
has been settled by wiping the slate. The cos. spent
£5320 in law and the town between £6OOO and £6500.
Each side pays its own costs ; the cos. pay no rates at all
for 1901, but as against that they don’t require repay-
ment of £3OOO which the court said they had overpaid in
1900. The law is just as uncertain as it was when the
row started, and while it remains so the lawyers may
hope for a renewal of the ructions any time. Of course
for the present the Privy Council appeal is abandoned.

The Bank of Adelaide, the lone survivor of four
South Australian banks, hasn’t quite kept up to the high
level it attained during the year ended March, 1901, but
its consistent prosperity still stands by it, and its growth

The profits represent £7 12s. 2d. per cent, per
annum on the shareholders’ funds with which the year
commenced—a very respectable figure. The Bank of
Adelaide holds £400,328 in Government securities—an
amount rather more than equal to its capital; and its
total reserve of cash and liquid securities is £1,081,284,
equal to 50 per cent, on all liabilities to the public. These
are exceedingly solid figures, and, though both deposits
and liquid securities are about £lOO,OOO less than they
were a year ago, the extra depression which has lately
settled on S.A. is sufficient explanation of that. The
solidity of the Bank of Adelaide appears to be a great
deal better assured than that of the State in which it has
its residence.
In 1890, the Bank of Adelaide had reserves
amounting to £196,986, but a wyiting-off of £50,000 for
losses made in the time of the great slump when the
Commercial Bank of S.A. went under, brought the figures
down materially. The loss has now been more than made
good, but with a bigger debt and a worse drought, and
even more gloomy prospects, hanging over the State
than in 1886, the reserves can’t be too solid. The Bank of
Adelaide has a capital of £400,000, so its total shareholders’
funds are £617,423. There is room for a much larger
institution than this in S.A., where outside banks do a
very large proportion of the business, and S.A.’s solitary
bank should keep its dividend at not more than the
present 8 per cent., and adhere steadily to the policy of
building up the institution. The old Bank of South
Australia had nominally £1,000,000 capital and reserves,
and the Commercial of S.A. about £500,000, and in the
days of their greatness the Bank of Adelaide was almost
as large as it is now. Since the two first-named have
died there is a considerable gap to fill.

The Colonial Bank (Melbourne) has so far
recovered that it is able to resume the payment of divi-
dends on its ordinary capital. Both ordinary and
preference shares receive 5 per cent, this half-year. The
Colonial Bank hasn’t much ordinary capital left now (only
£133,642) so the dividend isn’t a very large undertaking;
still it marks a distinct improvement in affairs. The
record since the cleaning up took place has been :

The profits are £7 6s. 6d. per cent, per annum on share-
holders’funds as at the commencement of the half-year.
Compared with six months ago note circulation has
increased by about £12,000; bills in circulation by
£38,000 ; deposits by £lO,OOO ; reserve of cash and liquid
securities by £49,000. This latter stands at £546,779
about 19 per cent, of all liabilities to the public. This is
far from being a strong reserve—in fact, it is one of the
weakest. The cash reserve is not below, or not much
below, the average, but as regards a second line of
defence in the shape of State securities there is prac-
tically none, the entire holding of these being £11,845.
The fact that this eminently unsafe policy is
exactly the same which the Colonial and many other
banks followed before 1893 is no recommendation. The
events of 1893 were a very bad advertisement for it. The
Colonial Bank should at ieast keep its new reserve. fund
separately invested in first-class securities, so that it can
be found when wanted. The old reserve fund in ’93 was
mixed up in the general business and couldn’t be found.

This shows very good progress. The earnings are at the
rate of £8 4s. sd. per cent, per annum on the share-
holders’ funds as at the beginning of the half-year, which
is above the average rate earned nowadays by the
banking institutions of the Commonwealth. The earnings
of the last half-year are the largest since the painful
events of 1893, and the amount added to the reserves is
also the largest. Another half-year like the one just
completed will raise the reserves beyond the highest
point which they had attained previous to 1893. In
every respect the last 12 months show a solid improve-
ment in the affairs of the Royal Bank, principal items
being as follows:
March, 1901. March, 1902. Increase.

Note circulation .. 6,667 .. 9,393 .. 2,726

All liquid securities .. 205,560 .. 235,321 .. 29,761
The very solid holding of State securities is an especially
good feature. They may deteriorate a little in a time of
slump, but they never fall as mortgages and landed
property do. If the Royal continues its present policy of
small dividends and careful building up of reserves, there
is no reason why it shouldn’t be able some time this half-
century to restore the £150,000 capital which disappeared
in the slump. The fact that it didn’t suspend in ’93 is
good for its prestige, and it isn’t hampered by preference
shares like some of its neighbors
• * * *
The Commercial Bank of Australia holds a
special meeting on May 1 to write down the fully-paid
ordinary shares from £6 to 10s. each, which will provide
something over £1,000,000 to cover losses on the Assets
Trust. This will leave the bank with £2,117,230 of pre-
ference capital and about £lOO,OOO of ordinary capital
paid up, and against this there will be about £1,000,000
of losses still to be provided for out of earnings—on
present calculations. A good deal of this may be re-
covered through the securities of the Assets Trust
realising more than the present valuation, but, again, it
may not. Also, a good deal ought to be recovered by the
repurchase of the depreciated Assets Trust deposits at a
discount, though so far this source of profit appears to
have been a good deal neglected. Still, at the moment there
seems to be about £1,000,000 to be provided (which leaves the
Commercial Bank with about £1,200,000 of capital intact,
over and above all losses). The question which interests
the shareholders is—how long is the providing process
likely to take. Apart from any profits realised by the
sale of properties or by the repurchase of deposits, that
depends entirely on earnings, and nobody knows what
the earnings are. It is a remarkable position, bub no
shareholder has any distinct idea what his own bank is
making. Last half-year the profit was £72,460, less the
amount of the Assets Trust’s loss for the half-year, what-
ever that might be. Judging by the valuation now put
on the Trust’s assets l -which must have some relation to
their earning loss may have been £22,000, and
in that case the net earnings would be £50,000, and after
paying the preference dividend, there would be nearly
£20,000 left with which to reduce the deficit. Things
may have been better, or they may not. The ques-
tion which some indignant person should ask
on May 1 is whether the shareholders are here-
after to know each year, not only how much their
bank earns, but also the profit or loss, as the case may be,
of their Assets Trust—the amount realised each half-year
from all sources (rents, interest, profit on repurchase of
deposits, and profits on sales of property), the amount
going out in interest and management expenses, and the
amount of the deficit still to be provided for so far as the
directors know it. Every paltry building or investment
society is able to show in each balance-sheet how its
deficit has increased or diminished, and the Assets Trust
is an investment society pure and simple, and can do the
same. Now that the amount of the deficit has been
acknowledged there is not even a bad excuse for secrecy.
A curious side-issue is the proposal of the
Commercial Bank directors to change the voting power
of shareholders from the present system (one vote for
each £1 of capital) to one vote for each share—the
individual with a £lO preference share and the one with a
10s. ordinary one to have equal authority. The curious
result is that if the 256,000 ordinary shares, or even
a large majority of them, remain good, or if those which
are forfeited should be re-issued, the ordinary shareholders
will boss the bank, whilp the holders of the 211,000 prefer-
ence shares, which represent nearly 20 times the capital
held by the ordinary shareholders, will be a mere
minority. The idea isn’t based on any democratic prin-
ciple ; why one capitalist with £lOOO at stake and no
liability for future calls should have 2000 votes while
another with £lOOO at stake under similar conditions
should have only 100 is a mystery. The ordinary share-
holder, in fact, hasn’t a penny of capital in the bank.
Not only is all his capital lost but about £900,000 of the
preference capital also, and if the sensible process of at
once writing off all losses was adopted there would be no
ordinary shareholder left.

On Ist January, 1893, the Mutual Life Association had an
assurance fund of £947,722, whilst on 31st December,
1901, the fund stood at £1,533,693. This is eminently
respectable progress. The business for the year just
ended is the largest on the Association’s record, and the
addition to the fund the second largest. Also there has
been a slight decrease in the expense rate :

The Mutual Life Association announced, at the beginning
of 1898, that it had'opened a London branch. Business
has certainly increased materially since then, but there
appears to be no permanent reduction in the heavy ex-
pense-rate to make things snore profitable for the policy-
holders. In fact, 1901 shows a higher expense-rate than
either 1895,1898 or 1899, and the expense-rate for 1900 was
still higher. There may be something in the British ex-
pansion policy to bring profits to the Australian policy-
holders, but it is certainly not apparent yet.
The usual and regular fall in the rate of interest-
earnings again asserts itself this year. It isn’t very much
of a fall this time, and there is still abundant margin
between the £3 10s. per cent, assumed to be earned and
the £4 Bs. 9d. per cent actually realised. Still this con-
tinuous decline, from which all offices are suffering, is
not a cheerful thing for policy-holders to contemplate.
The figures in recent years have been as follows :

The Mutual Life Association adheres steadily to
the wise practice of making provision as it goes along for
possible depreciation of its mortgages, foreclosed proper-
ties and freehold securities. It includes no dubious or
paper items among its assets. And a specially commend-
able feature is that a very small proportion of its new
accumulations are being invested in mortgages, and the
bulk is going into State and municipal securities. The
Association has always been a solid, reliable, and well-
managed institution, and it continues to live up to the
character.

Wyalong may be a one-lode field, but if that lode is not a

It is quite a false idea to judge Wyalong by present

Maorilander Dr. Black’s report on the Latrobe

crude oil per ton —tests range from 44 to 78. He says the
mineral is more like the Russian petroleum shale than the
American, N.S.W., or Scotch shale, having less paraffin
than the latter, and being heavier. From 300 oz. of crude
oil there was recovered 21oz. benzine, 250 z. No. 1 lighting-
oil, 15joz. No. 2 lighting oil, and 105 oz. of Rubricating
oils of various qualities. The estimated costs"'of produc-
tion run from 6|d. per gal. for benzine and lighting-oil to

far little better than surface tests of the beds have been

gross mismanagement on the property, and unless a won-
derful change takes place in the administration of the
venture in the near future the prospects of the English
shareholders are gloomy in the extreme.” Cockburn,

Trent, general manager of North Lyell, is
nothing if not trenchant. His latest letters to London
will shock the shareholders. He says that he was
deceived as to the value of the mine. In London he was
told that the average value of the ore was 16 per cent. ;
but his sampling showed it to be less than 8. Still,
“plenty of money could be made therefrom with proper
facilities.” Concentration was essential, but the directors
at first paid no heed to his recommendations, and forced
him to smelt against his own judgment. All the hue-
and-cry about blast furnaces “comes from those who
have worthless flux (?) mines that they want to swindle
the company with.” The directors are told that
for them “to be influenced by a lot of inexperienced
amateur metallurgists, and the other blatant
know-nothings, is ridiculous, obnoxious, and inde-
cent. I do not demand payment for drinking
or gambling, nor for defrauding the company by neglect-
ing my duties. It is all very well to echo malicious
remarks of vindictive and jealous lunatics, and old men
in their dotage. I have been attacked and vilified for
over three months by a newspaper, owned and controlled
by three directors —two of these are members of the
London board. If the co. does not take steps to protect
me I will defend myself. Especially will I defend the
shareholders against such waste, stupidity, and fraud as
they have suffered from.” The letter from which these
extracts are made puts a plain issue to the shareholders—
either they must sack the directors or Trent. They may
find a grain of comfort in Trent’s opinion : “ We have all
the elements of a magnificent enterprise, but it has eaten
its own life, assisted by the greatest of living parasites,
the Mount Lyell Co."

From Westralia: Golden Horseshoe directors
have been considering a proposal that any new plant they
may want shall be built at the seaside. Kaufman, one of
the directors, in a circular issued from the office, talks of
another 100 head as justified. On the lease they are
cramped for room. 0. G. Kliig, commissioned by the
Govt, to recommend ore-reducing works for Phillips
River field, breaks new ground. He favors not local
works at all, but State organisation of shipments to
eastern works, with State advances against parcels thus
dealt with. He thinks that thousand-ton lots could be
more cheaply sent round to the Sydney side for treatment
than smelted on the spot. Another shuffle of wardens
and resident magistrates comes on soon. Among the
changes will most likely be the retirement of My-God-I-
am-proud-of-Bigjohn Brown, after very long service to
Groperdom in Parliament and on the bench.

Half-yearly report of Ivanhoe Junction, ad-
joining Ivanhoe South Extended on west, isn’t over-
exhilarating. Ore at 500 ft. occurs in small lenses, or
patches, and, where found, averages at most lldwt.,
merely confirming experience of shallower levels. Yet
chairman of Kalgoorlie Consols, still further west, in
proposing the third reconstruction of that wild cat, stated
that the Junction had struck a lode at 600 ft. worth
22dwt., “and, therefore, the chance of making a good
discovery in our ground is distinctly more favorable.”
This blarney had the usual result, and an assessment of
Is. will provide another £lO,OOO to squander.
* * * *
As the English Courts blocked the Paringa
directors from issuing the 10s. reserve shares at 70 per
cent, discount, directors now threaten to reconstruct.
This co. has been an absolute cat from its inception, and
nobody but a fool would put another cent into the ven-
ture. Shareholders were told that Sulman and Picard
had been appointed managers of mine, and they “antici-
pated considerable saving in the cost of treating telluride
ores, and think that the new oil-process may be of great
value in the treatment of ores from the Brown Hill-Iron
Duke lode.” As the Iron Duke is working this lode 300
to 400 ft. east of the Paringa at the same depth—6soft.—at
which the Paringa management alleges that it has it, the
conclusion is obvious. The Paringa has no ore, telluride
or otherwise, on its property except in a leader on
Cassidy Hill. Co. is £26,000 in debt, hence the anxiety
to go to the milch-cow.

Algernon Moreing still tries to fool holders of
Associated Northern and Oroya that their salvation lies
in amalgamating with the worked-out Brown Hill, sad-
dled with its made-in-Germany white elephants. There
must be something mesmeric about the air of N.S. Wales,
since four of the leading lights in the Kangaroo market —
viz., Algernon Moreing, O. E. Hogg, Frank Gardner, and
Black Jack Collins, are quondam Cornstalks. An admir-
able quartette truly.

Bewick, Moreing, and Co. have now been
permanently put in charge of Lake View Consols,, and, at
present rate of progress, will shortly control every mine
in the State. It is hardly a subject for congratulation,
all things considered. Mr. J. R. M‘Kay, the popular
accountant, as a result of the change, has resigned and is
off to Sydney.

Island Eureka produced another 5070 z. from
380 tons, which ensures a further 3d. div. this month.
From all accounts mine continues to open up well.
Main weakness is that 70,000 out of 80,000 shares were
originally held by a syndicate of four, who are gradually
panning them out ; when they are fairly distributed

First clean-up of Hampton Plains battery, from
stone from the Merry Hampton mine, has taken place,
and the result is such that no particulars are forthcoming.

early collapse of the venture looks probable.

G-reat Oversight, Bulong, comes along with
another rich parcel, this time from the Welcome syndi-
cate claim. Including dollied gold, 7170 z. were recovered
from 64£ tons. This is the first parcel from the claim in
question, and many more of equal quality are predicted.

The diamond-drill bores at the bottom level of
Boulder Main Reef have tested the full width of the lease
without locating anything of value. It looks very much
as if lodes or gold had quite petered out below the 600 ft.

Future of company apparently very gloomy.

Gwalia Consolidated, a re-liash of some half-

The Boulder mines own 28 Griffin mills in all—
-12 at Perseverance, 10 at Gt. Boulder, and sax at S.
Kalgurli. On an average 50 per cent, of the shafts and
pans are broken monthly by unexploded dynamite and
caps finding their way into the mill. The wear and tear
and loss of time for repairs is enormous and must increase
treatment-cost several shillings a ton, but one never hears
of this. The money goes, all the same.

New South Wales becomes a colder and
colder place for the female in search of a
husband. In 1871 there were 27,534 women
over 18 looking for a husband and not finding

A recent row of some dimensions at

Chinaman and a Jew. Things get a good deal
mixed at times in this rising young country,
though N.S.W. is not a badly-mixed State as
things go hereabouts. A thousand miles further
north you may be hit with a badly-aimed beer-

who came with the Malay half-breed into the
Irishman’s public-house, found a brown Dutch

The great O’Sullivan, lecturing recently
in Sydney on “The Future of Australia,” casta
blazing eye into futurity, and saw this country, 50
or 100 years hence, with a population of 60 or 70
millions, and the “arbiter and controller of the
Southern world.” It is more likely, unless rain
comes more frequently, to muster some eight or
ten millions with a few billion rabbits, and no
O’Sullivan; and it is always worth considering
that South America may yet want to argue the
point before it is quite blotted out of the Southern
world; still, O’Sullivan’s garish polysyllables
do no harm, and when he whirls his irre-
sponsible limbs in patriotic fervor he raises a
pleasant breeze on a hot day and blows the hats
of his audience out of the door into the street.
Nobody takes the O’Sullivan’s mental flappings
quite seriously, but his energy is refreshing to look
upon in a languid country, and he can get to a
place faster, and say more while he is there, and
get away more suddenly than anybody else in this
country; also he looks fresher, after travelling
500 miles at a cost of £lOO to open a bridge worth
£45, than any other man of his years in these
parts.

A returned cohentingenter pours into the
sympathetic ear of a Sydney pro-Gore paper his
wail. It seems he carried his military credentials
to—
every department of the Public Service to be met
everywhere with snubs, and treated in some quarters as
almost a cadger. Finding it impossible to get State
employment as a returned soldier, he at last burnt all his
military references, denied that he had ever been in
Africa, and ultimately got a junior position—ensuring
board and lodging—in a private business.
Good ! “He burnt all his military references.”
We look forward cheerfully to the day when Aus-
tralia as a nation will be burning all its military
references.

At a meeting held in Sydney by the
Bushmen who were not able to enlist in the
Federal cohentingent, the chairman consoled the
men by telling them that they might get over to
S’ Africa and join an irregular corps, and con-
cluded : “If they did join an irregular corps they
would meet with all kinds —some queer sorts of
men, lots of whom would ‘blow them out ’ as soon
as any Boer.” Evidently the Bush veldt Buccaneer
business was a very well-understood one officially :
it was even understood that among such ruffians
dog would eat dog.

At a welcome-home to some cohen-

Unless Thou knowest it be rightly had :

John Smith, policeman :
I don't like arristing a drunk woman. Gimme the
biggest man in town, I don’t care how bastely drunk, an’
I’m on to him with a willin’ mind, but a drunk woman !
I’d take two bates rather than tackle her. What does
she do ? Ask me something aisy. She’s the very divil.
Look at me nose, mhan. A man lies like a log or wants
to fight, an’ I make meself ready ; but a woman wants to
do both an’ twinty other things at the same time, an’ ye
can’t be prepared. She clats and scrats an’ bites an’
squeals. An’ the crowd sides with her. What is the
worst thing she does? Well, when the divil’s powerful
strong in her she makes love to me—tore, mhan, love. ■ A
drunk woman is the horriblist thing on feet, I tell ye.
REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM.
MRS. EROSMONT: “ I'm sure I
can't imagine what the men
see in Miss Frail’s figure.
Why, if she were an ace thinner
she'd have no figure at all."
A tough ruling (by N.S.W. Judge Gibson,
sitting as a Supreme Judge) which lawyers are
still chewing : Several attempts, some successful,
had been made at Broken Hill to burn a number
of houses owned by the same man. A constable,
set to watch, saw a woman going to one of the
houses at 2 a. m. with a bottle of kerosene. He
told her he was a miner coming from work, and
she told him something. His Honor (rightly)
threw that out. Later on, when the woman,
having been arrested, knew that her “ miner ” was
a constable, she made further statements to
other officers. ’Sonah (and this is the part
that some find tough) threw those statements out
as well, on the ground that the woman was
possibly influenced in making them by the fact
that she had been duped into making the first
statement. Though undefended, except by the
Judge, the woman was acquitted.
Though a Circuit Court is held at Broken Hill
at least twice a year, it is over four years since a
Supreme Court Judge sat there. Every time a
commission has been issued to either a practising
barrister or a lower-court J udge. Broken Hill,
you see, is “a beastly place to get to.” Moral:
Appoint younger Supreme Court Judges.

The other night, at a little
Italian restaurant off Gfeorge-st., Sydney
(much frequented by artists, musicians and

ade. His preparations were awe-inspiring.
To stop the circulation of blood, presum-
ably, he had his arms and legs tightly
bound with handkerchiefs. He got through

That Nowra (N.S.W.) girl of 17
who poisoned herself because she wasn’t

There is little hope of the formation
of the proposed Sydney Clerks’ Union :
the same cause which makes a man a
clerk makes him a non-unionist. It. is
difficult to imagine a man, who is willing
to work for 255. a week in a “genteel”
occupation and wear a high collar and
a black coat, whilst there are stones to be
broken or drains to be swept at £2 a
week, having enough spirit to go on strike
for a living wage.

London Daily Chronicle having
printed (with an evident deep pride in its
knowledge) the fact that Sydney Parlia-
ment buildings are not of a magnificent
character, an Australian in London gener-
ously supplements the statement
with the information that he has repeatedly
seen scores of interested politicians seated on
the kerbstone outside on summer evenings
smoking their pipes, listening to the speeches,
and expressing applause or dissent. The voices
of the speakers were almost as audible without
as within, and the Labor members, being particu-
larly sturdy of lung, could be clearly followed on
the opposite side of Macquarie-street.
This is, or was, more or less a true bill.
Present writer, who used to lodge in Mac-
quarie-st., nearly opposite Parliament
House, used to have to keep his bedroom-
window shut, to partially exclude the noise
of the late John M‘Elhone, M.P., when he
bawled at the House with 40-bull power.

A marrow-freezer :
A butcher, suing his employers for damages in a Vic.
Court, owing to the loss of a couple of fingers snatched
off in a sausage-machine, stated that he didn’t know what
happened to the sausage-meat after the fingers fell into it.
Pass the sausages! Apropos, this writer was supping
once at a street coffee-stall with a noted Sydney cricketer,
and the latter got (as he imagined) a piece of gristle in his
mouth. Closer examination showed it to be the first
joint of a man’s finger, nail and all, which had evidently
been chopped off and swept into the pie. But—horror !
that pie may have been all Man !
A gentle, blue-eyed, flower-faced school-
angel turned up at a little somnolent M.L. town-
ship the other day to vary her humdrum existence
with the usual tale. The “criminal” was a local
resident, who was promptly arrested, but the con-
stable, who seems to have been endowed with
horse-sense, was equally prompt in collaring the
girl and bringing her to a doctor for examination.
And the doctor swore that the girl’s yarn must be
false. In discharging the accused the bench com-
mended the constable’s sense, but didn’t make any
suggestion about the girl. Yet a citizen can’t
hope to always have the benefit of a sensible con-
stable’s action when he runs up against a girl of
this sort.
An information was, aPfew days ago, laid in a
N.S.W. town by a girl who weighs 12st., or
thereabouts, against a young man, who, she
alleged, caught her in the main street as she was
gassing the house where he was boarding, carried
er about 20 yards over a fence, and down a
narrow passage into his room, and committed the
usual assault. No one in the house knew of the
crime until the landlady saw the girl leaving the
premises. The case was dismissed by an unfeel-
ing bench. Evidently simple faith in a lady’s
statement is a, vanishing quantity in N.S.W., and
the age of chivalry is passing away.

A picnic party, mostly girls, recently
returned to an up-country M.L. town and told the
Eolice that one of their number was lost in the
ush, and possibly drowned. They had missed
him towards evening. A search party turned out
and hunted round all night. At 3 a.m. they
got back, to be told that the young man was safe
in bed. While scrambling over a log he had tom
his pants badly, and had slipped home by a back
way. That was all.

The Jones-M‘Kenzie horror, as related in

He seduced his other daughter, who afterwards

The Port Adelaide highway-robbery case
was only ended last week, when the Full
Court considered whether Chief-Justice Way had
administered the law properly at the trial. He,
of course, thought he had, and it would have
needed Judges Boucaut and Bundey both to differ
from him to upset the conviction. The only
trouble was whether Flynn offered to make a
statement when it’ was technically past his time
for doing so. But the Judges played the game
strictly, and decided that his counsel had “ closed
the case ” before that. So he got 10 years.
Lawson had already received 20, and nobody
seems to trouble about his vehement assertion,
which was possibly quite true, that Flynn was not
in the robbery at all.

A Tasmanian paper remarks that someone
has been inquiring into the old and musty yarn of
a schooner Osprey, which traded between San
Francisco and Hongkong and Hobart at the time
when the real Roger Tichhorne was probably
drowned, along with all the other passengers and
crew of the Bella. Seems that there was an
Osprey, which might have picked up a ship-
wrecked Roger, but the captain, in after years,
couldn’t remember such a happening, and, as the
interval between the loss of the Bella and the end
of the Tichborne case was not more than 20 years,
the chances are that the Hobartian Osprey never
brought any Roger to Australia, as was alleged
by that beautiful liar, the Tichborne Claimant,
and his unveracious witness, the late Jean Luie.
Yet there will always be an interest attaching to
genuine Osprey stories until the last student of
the Tichborne case is physically or mentally
defunct. The Claimant’s story of the alleged
rescue was crushed by what seemed to be satisfac-
tory proof that no three-masted schooner Osprey
had been known in Australian waters, or any
other waters, at the time of the Bella disaster.
The Tichborne parties who contested the claim of
the Wagga Wagga butcher, and showed him to
be a liar as regards his evidence re his own iden-
tity, were just as keen on proving that the real
Sir Roger passed out of existence with the Bella
aforesaid, and never got to Australia, anyhow.
They did prove it to the satisfaction of a jury at
the time. But since then the Australian evidence
of a possible Sir Roger’s landing in this country
has grown stronger, without weakening the con-
viction that the Wagga Wagga man was an utter
fraud.

There is again serious trouble in Sydney
medical circles on the “boycott” question. A
suburban doctor, against whom a decree of boycott
was promulgated by N.S.W. branch of British
Medical Association for “unprofessional con-
duct” in acting for a certain lodge, summoned
another suburban man to his assistance for an
operation. And the other man, loyal to the
8.M.A., wouldn’t go. Later, he found that three
of the very biggest guns of the association hadn’t
scrupled to assist the boycotted one (and their
own bank funds) by meeting him in consultation,
and now he complains that the B.M. A. spreads
its net for little offenders only, and allows the big
ones to go free. Discussion of the event is causing
much bitterness.

“Boko” : The extension of the Sydney
tram system to Little Bay has surely been a
success from a revenue point of view. Every day
sees many travellers, while on Saturdays and
Sundays it is often hard to procure a seat. But it is
a questionable benefit to the hospital to have a
crowd overrunning the place and picnicking in the
grounds. The authorities cannot very well refuse
entrance to relatives; the difficulty is in dis-
crimination —a hospital for infectious diseases is
hardly a place for promiscuous holiday-making.

A correspondent complaining of street
noises to a Melbourne paper :
In Sydney the nuisance is beginning to be recognised,
and any milkman or rowdy person yelling on a Sunday is
fined or “ run in ” by the police.
Distant hills are ever green. Sydneyites know
nothing of police action against yellers on Sunday,
or any other day.
A S.A. veteran priest tells this story.
While doing his district he stopped at a small and
unfrequented backblox pub. The domestic,
bustling around excitedly putting things in order
for so distinguished a guest, suddenly asked:
“Are you a Catholic priest, sir?” “Yes, my
dear, I am.” “ Oh, are you really ? lam so glad.”
“So am I!”
“H.G.” tells a
story of brigand-
age :
The story of the
Albert Park (Melb.)
blackmailers (B.
29/3/’O2) recalls the
exploits of the “Bull-
Money Push,” which
throve at the St.
Kil d a end of the
same area some ten
years ago. The tac-
tics of the B.M.P.
were very suave un-
less the victims
proved o b s t in a t e.
After locating a loving
couple the leader
would approach and
deferentially observe,
“Excuse me, sir, I
am sorry to disturb
you and your lady-
friend, but my father
has the lease of this
park, and he is re-
sponsible to the Police
Dept, for the be-
haviour of those who

poor man, and he
can’t afford to lose
his lease. Might I
suggest that ss. would
not be too much to
recoup me for my

tion here to-night.
Of course I should be
extremely unwilling
to call the attention

times in ten the man
would pay-up and
think how lucky he
was to have to deal
with such a decent
young fellow. The
tenth man, however,
might “ take it fight-

leader would whistle,
and his merry men
would jump from
neighboring bushes
and “ deal with ” the
victim. One pleasing
custom of the frater-
nity was to plaster
tar on the hair of the
couple who wouldn’t
pay up.

According to a

A hospice for tired clergymen has been offered to the
Bishop of London by a lady, who will provide the £l6OO
required annually for the maintenance of the institution.
But what about a hospice for Tired Congregations ?

“ His assailants knocked him to the
ground again and while in that position bru-
tally maltreated him, the accused in particular
making himself conspicuous in the attack.
He kicked the prostrate man in the face,”
&c. That isn’t the account of how some
alleged Boers treated a wounded Australian
in time of war, but of how a wounded Austra-
lian was treated by other Australians in time
of peace. Though horribly disfigured he
escaped with his life by mere accident. And
an Australian jury, finding these things
proved, recommended the barbarian to mercy
out of its sympathy for outrages of the kind,
as Australian juries are accustomed to do, and
he got off with a light sentence. What is the
good of this country affecting to be shocked at
any other country’s “ atrocities ? ”

Government has long since floored the
old wheeze about a man’s home being his
castle, by compelling the householder to keep
his castle in a reasonably clean state, and it is
quite time that it extended its functions to in-
dividuals by requiring them to wash their
clothes and persons occasionally, under pain
of being proclaimed infected areas to be pub-
licly scrubbed and disinfected. One often
sees in Australian streets men—not unem-
ployed—wearing clothes which are a menace
to the public health.

As soon as financial prospects permit,
the See Govt, will negotiate with Britain for
the ground on which Sydney Mint now
stands, with the view of adding the site and
buildings to the hospital alongside. It will
be necessary, however, to present Britain with
another site and a structure equally service-
able.

The Bulletin hears of a Sydney man,
employed in the fish-and-restaurant business,
who, the other week, worked 111 hours for 30s.
—lO5 hours being a very common thing.

Sydney “Soup Kitchen,” a privately-

meals last month.
The troubles of Preacher Hay, the gentle-
man whose habit of performing cheap marriages at
matrimonial agencies was judicially alluded to with
some vigor a year or so ago, again helped to break
the drab monotony of Sydney last week. Preacher
Hay, by his own account, paid 255. a week for the
use of three rooms on the premises of a violent and
ill-regulated family; though the family account
was that it had made the mistake of taking in a
fierce and ungovernable pastor on terms which
were not at all commensurate with his ferocity.
The family testified that it only threatened to
have the preacher run-in, and that, in boring holes
in the roof and walls of his room, it hadn’t been
actuated by any evil motive ; it merely wanted, as
a matter of curiosity, to see him performing the
marriage ceremony. It denied pouring ink on the
preacher through the holes, or throwing a jug of
water over him, though it admitted sending sulphur
fumes through his broken window, and pounding a
tambourine outside his premises, and making reflec-
tions on his veracity. It was solid on the fact that
it never battered the aged caretaker of his Sus-
pended Deleterious Church, or some such name,
so that that person would never be in proper
repair again. On the other hand, the preacher
declared that he didn’t try to wreck the sign-
board, that he didn’t throw red ink at the family
on Easter Monday, or hit it eight times with a
chisel, to its serious personal injury; that he
didn’t swear, or kick anybody’s young brother;
but that the family “ took possession of his body ”
and shoved him off his own legally-hired pre-
mises. The legal decision was, that it was all an
incomprehensible cat-fight, and the four cases
were dismissed with un-Christian feelings all
round.

“ E.E.” describes an Assyrian duel fought
in a Sydney suburb: —
The two angry combatants are escorted to a park by
their respective seconds, who pray aloud on their way.
On arrival at the selected spot (it is an early morning
function), the combatants, who are armed with sticks,
kneel down and pray for about five minutes. When the
prayer is finished, the seconds lift them off their knees,
take them about eleven paces apart, and sool them at one
another like bull-terriers. On being released, the com-
batants yell and belt one another across the head with
their sticks. When one of the duellists falls stunned, his
seconds carry him home, but the victor is left in the
park, where he prays aloud —presumably for the battered
one’s recovery.
ON PRINCIPLE.
TEMPERANCE ORATOR (deprecatingly): “ You
have misunderstood, my friend; I said pro-
hibitionist, not pro-British.”
FRIEND OF HUNMANITY (huskily): “Maybe you
did, Mister, and maybe you (hie) didn't;
but, anyway, I don't see why I shouldn’t take
a couple of rounds out o’ you on (hie)
principle.”
CHOICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
That man who has no smaller earth
Can claim the world his home,
For it will yield him life and place
Wherever he shall roam ;
The man who feels no foolish love
Shall never see its end,
And he, alone with all the world,
Can make the world his friend.
Yet for my choice I could not live
Without— however free —
The dearer ties that life can give,
The love that claimeth me.
My soul protests that it is best,
While I have heart and breath,
To live upon the lips of love
Or mourn upon its death.
HAMER.
ANOTHER BALLAD OF KISSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are three Kisses woman’s lips do know
That make the Love-song of her blossoming years.
The first—at which her blushes come and go —
The awakening Kiss 1 How golden life appears 1
It is the only Kiss which knows no tears.
The second Kiss, we none of us forget,
Its riot runs through every singing vein,
The Girl and Woman here have duly met
And Love disputes his egipiry with pain.
That second Kiss !—we never feel again.
The third—the Careless Kiss —is ours for aye,
It breathes so sadly that Romance is dead—
A spray of roses and a Summer Day—
And down the hill the golden years have fled—
Yet nothing of this kiss have Poets said.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
My Drab Aran.- Bjdn6r ' April 22 - 1902 '
Some distinguished visitors have patronised
Sydney lately: Sir Arthur Lawley, Gov. of W A
is said to be over for pure love and affection of
his former schoolfellow, Major-General Downe;
and is talking “Stalky and Co.” to Downe,
n D • ! whose objective m Australia is remounts!
Officials have filled the visitor full of Sydney
information ; he has inspected “Cranbrook,” the
new State Govt. House ; done some station visit-
ing; and a harbor excursion with Mr. See as
helmsman. Mr. Seddon, Bun Tuck of M.L.
passed through, as one of his admirers remarked,’
like a theodolite.” Presumably the speaker
meant meteorite, but Bun Tuck wouldn’t know the
difference. Mr. Seddon told “foxes’’about the
Maoris. I hey were as generous to foes as any man
iti j that is true, we must have a fine
set or fiends at the front. Maoris as warriors have
not been tested since the war of some 40 years ago,
when they tortured their prisoners, wounded and
otherwise, in Red Indian fashion. In their tribal
i V m rS j too ’ Prisoners n ot required for slaves were
killed, cooked and eaten. With the memory of
Revs. Grace and Volkner and the gouging-out of
their living eyes still fresh, Mr. Seddon says the
Maoris conducted their tribal wars with humanity.
Wonder what the family of Major von Tempsky
thinks of the Seddon sentiments ?
Bnt Premiers, Governors and such are common
enough ; the unique visitor was Amy Castles,
ui?’Ji wa y, ought certainly to put a few
ballads on her programme. Maorilanders can
appreciate the glories of Italian ring-tailed music
quite as much as N.S. Welshmen, but they would
f 6 cs 6 *'^ le Deal” and the “Last Rose
of Summer” as much as we would appreciate
them. Dam, when he had heard for the first
time the first dozen notes of Amy’s song, said, in
his own Doric, of “I hear now the voice
of a celebrity.”
Dr. Tidswell, Govt. MicroWSiogist, was married
k° -Miss Edith Millie Jones, a daughter of
the Hon. Richard Jones, at Homebush. The mar-
nage was as fashionable as Sydney society, money
and frocks could make it; but the honeymoon was
shortened by a paddymelon’s death. Married on
Thursday, dissecting bubonic paddymelons, other-
wise kangaroo-rats on Saturday—that’s Dr. Tids-
well, bridegroom and devoted man of science. The
Zoo has been closed for a fortnight. Plague was
introduced into the gardens by rats which for
uaany years past have helped the captive
animals eat Govt, rations. The rats are quite
tame and trot about in public view with perfect
unconcern in the lions’ and tigers’ cages. They
lookjupon themselves evidently as favored exhibits.
On Saturday last Miss Emily Evans, 8.A., was
decorated with the degree of LL.B., at the hands
of the Chancellor of Sydney University. Before
Miss Evans can enter the profession, however,
Parliament will have to be asked to give her a
special permit. Both the Judges and members of
the Bar will view this new introduction with awe.
A pretty and very proper Society lady was
walking through certain Botanical Gardens on
a recent morning. She lingered to admire a rose-
bush covered with beautiful flowers, when a
gardener asked her if she would like one. The
lady assented, and the man cut her a rose from
the bush. Some weeks later the same lady was
again passing through those Gardens, and, as she
stood admiring a cluster of carnations, the gar-
dener made his appearance on the scene. He in-
stantly recognised her and stopped. “Excuse
me, mum,” he said politely, “but I’m sorry I
can’t give you a flower to-day. You see, the boss
is about. But I’ll tell you. I’ve got a garden of
my own at ■, and I’ll bring you a bunch of
roses if you’ll meet me to-morrow night in front
of the G.P.O. at 8 o’clock.”
The exhibition of pictures of old Sydney closed
on Saturday, after drawing crowds daily for a
month. It was an interesting show, and some of
the 145 pictures were well-painted studies of
places that Mr. O’Sullivan is going to improve
off the face of the State. Deep cuttings, sheer
stone walls, houses perched aloft with wooden
ladders leading from doors ; women gossiping at
gates ; ragged children, fowls, and goats about the
lane-ways. There has been a wonderful unanimity
of opinion as to the admission of the William
Goat in the studies : Valiant, long-bearded, fear-
somely horned, he stands in gutters and on veran-
dahs and spoils for a fight. Most of the artists
seem to have painted these pictures when old
Sydney was doing its washing, for most of the
cottages have a wash on a line, stretched between,
say, a gatepost and a tree. It is a decorous wash
all the time—a quilt, two towels, and an onion-bag
is the “hang out” of my recollection. Govt,
bought 14 pictures, at a cost of £235, off artists
Ashton, Leist, Long, Spong, Backhouse, Alice
Muskett and Stuart Wilson. Outside the State
purchases there was a solitary little one guinea
study bought. Verily, the crowd that visited the
ex. doesn’t want mementoes of its dark, historic
places. Dr. Andrew Houison lent a pen-colored
engraving of views of Sydney as she was 70
years ago. The insurance on these was £250, so
the ex-president of our Historical Soc. must value
them.
•In Chicago(U.S.A.) the domestic servants have
formed a union. They demand 8-hour shifts,
“ company ” in the kitchen at nights, days off
each week, and definitely-prescribed work. The
demand for domestic servants far exceeds supply.
The Irish won’t fill the bill—now they rule the
cities. The Italians are there, but they cannot
adapt themselves to the duties, the Germans work
for themselves, the Swedes are too few, the Japs
won’t go round, and the Labor unions won’t let in
the Chinaman. At our Sydney State Registry
office I saw the manageress and a worried-looking
lady walk into the servants’ waiting - room
where about 20 cooks, “generals,” and house-
maids sat in stolid silence “waiting engagements.”
“ Will one of you girls go to Milson’s Point ? ”
asks the former. “ A good place, 12s. a week and
only two ladies in family.” And the damsels
begin to study their boots very earnestly. Would-
be employer said to a suitable-looking woman,
“ Why won’t you take the place?” and got the
answer: “I don’t care to live out of George-street
or Pitt-street; every other plice is too lonely! ”
Fresh Air League Ball occurs on 27th of next
month. The leaguers must be very financial this
year, for they have already in hand as donations,
money for the rent of the hall, music and
decorations. New Governor Rawson will make
his first ball-room appearance at the F.A.L.B.
“ Done For ” sends me this:—
I am very far advanced in consumption, so far that my
case is utterly hopeless. Some 16 months ago I lived in
a South Yarra boarding-house which I left to go into the
country in a vain search of health. I returned to the
city, the other day, terribly exhausted after a long rail-
way ride in hot weather; so done up that on getting
out of the cab at the door of my old location I had to sit
on the kerb to gain breath. I have fallen in weight from
12st. 41b. to 7st. or under, and everybody can see it. I
have doom written on my face, and shudder every time I
find myself in front of a street shop mirror ; so no
wonder the people at my old boarding-house, who were
very kind to me in the days ere their boarders knew so
much about the contagiousness of phthisis, wouldn’t take
me in. I don’t blame them ; for to receive me would be
to lose all their other guests. I can’t get into any decent
place and no public hospital will find room for me.
It is time the Government hurried up with con-
sumptive sanatoria. There’s a good field for
private philanthropy, or even private enterprise,
in this matter. A cottage with a garden, five or
six rooms to begin with, in a clear, open district;
a nurse or two, and a doctor to call weekly. If
“Done For,” even in his far-gone stage, would
buy a tent, and camp on some high, sunny
ground, there are good odds in favor of at least
his partial recovery, I know of a man who could
hardly crawl, so far gone was he in phthisis.
Doctors said he couldn’t live three months. Then
the man from whom he used to get money to pay
for his room left the neighborhood, and the
phthisicky one was compelled to sleep in the
Domain. That was six years ago, and he looks
pretty strong to-day and can work. But nothing
but a rainy night would induce him to sleep under
a roof.
A price-list of diplomatic uniforms for the
Coronation is to hand from a London firm of
artist-tailors. I find I can get a “ blue superfine
cloth coat, richly embroidered in best gold em-
broidery, lined throughout with silk” for £lOB,
and a “pair of blue trousers, richly laced for £5
155.; a cocked hat, feather and loop for £5 155.,
and a best quality mercurial-gilt diplomatic sword
for £2 155.” Sword-knots and frog-belts are also
quoted. I would like to get some of these things
—the cocked-hat for choice —and wear it when I
write to you. The most humorous item is the
“ diplomatic sword.” It has no business point or
side, you may be sure, and is not to be used on
Boers, or for duelling, but simply for ornament,
and to get between its wearer’s legs and trip him
up.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Flemington sparkled on Saturday with all the
golden glamor of a mid-summer meeting. The
Hopetouns put in an appearance early with their
three lean, aides. The Countess
brightened her pallor with a geranium-pink outfit
—quite a lively hue of fine satin cloth. This was
cut Eton-wise and foamed at the neck into a ruff
of cream. Mrs. Corbet left the V.R. pen for the
afternoon, and chummed with other racy dames.
She wore a hop-green rig-out, a blue chiffon toque
and black ruff with her familiar careless air. The
Gov.-General lawned it with his consort, and
showed up particularly yellow in the light of that
vivid pink frock.
“ The Brough couple had a day of much feting
at Flemington. The Hopetouns made a bee-line
for them when the eminent mummers hove into
sight, and all society gazed with envy as the
Countess turned on her most amiable and pleasant
smile in pump-handling Mrs. Brough. The quar-
tette broke up only after a long and animated
confab. The Naicest followed suit and nearly
broke their necks in a rush to lionise the favored
pair. Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Raleigh closed on
them and bore them off to tea. A popular trio
from Her Majesty’s show watched the mobbing
of the Broughs with a good-natured laugh. Their
troubles about ’lgh Society.
“ A most interesting crowd occupied the stand
in the neighborhood of the V.R. pens. Mrs. E.
Barton, minus the Prime Minister, was a pleasant
figure in an impressive pink muslin frock and
black toque. John Forrest’s wife repeated the
disastrous blend of pinks and heliotrope previously
perpetrated on a smart world. P.M.-G. Drake’s
wife was a large solid figure in brown, with
spacious allotments of a fearful shrimp-pink.
Rupert Clarke incessantly patrolled the Terrace
with the dressy Mrs. Lawson. Black voile, dust-
collecting a yard behind, and broken up with
hurdles of costly lace, was calculated to show-off
Mrs. Lawson’s up-standing figure. Mrs. Frank
Keating, a neat little lady, trotted forth one of
her latest ’Ome confections—a very handsome
white silk, covered up with chiffon and real lace.
Anotherreturned globe-trotter, Miss Claire Wilson,
showed a slighter figure than of yore, and a thinner
face, but she scored for a certain pert prettiness—
accentuated since gondola-swimming—in a navy-
blue voile, a sweet-17 lace collar, and a black hat
backed up with much fine plumage. The wealthy
widow, Mrs. David M’Caughey, whose engage-
ment to a certain much-trumpeted Sydney mili-
tary hero was announced one week and announced
to be off a few weeks later, was a conspicuous
frocker. She wore a cinnamon brown cloth with
Maltese lace collar and fancy silk and furbishings,
and a large girlish cinnamon-colored hat. Mrs.
M'Caughey is the most youthful mother of four
big children. Miss Millie Carter tossed a white
head as gaily as anyone, She was garbed in a
wonderful dress which boasted a rivalry in layers
of exquisite lace and strips of hand-painted
ribbon.
“ Lauri was sandwiched between Carrie Moore
and Maud Chetwynd at the races. Carrie’s lean
figure appeared quite broad in a heavy snuff-
brown frieze with scarlet helpings. The chirpy
Maud was in dancing spirits, and toed the terrace
in a minuet step. She wore blue, with top-story
relief of much guipure.
“The‘Daughters of the Court’ have not yet
got over the effects of the frigid Countess’s
presence at their recent annual meeting. One
very icy incident that has escaped mention thus-
far was Her Matchless Reservety’s refusal of a
cup of tea which a glowing young Daughter
offered her on a tray. The cup that joy had
filled so gaily threatened to run over with the
damsel’s tear when she got out of sight, but the
Countess seemed quite unconscious of having
hurt .anybody’s loyal feelings. The fact is her
constitutional shyness doesn’t allow her to think
of anything but her own uncomfortable position
when she is under close scrutiny at these polite
gatherings. She is a stage-frighted actress who
might get along pretty well if she had a
promptress to whisper instructions and ‘ give her
a word’ occasionally. As ill-luck will have it
Her Bendless Timidity is somewhat deaf, so she
cannot be whispered as she would wish.
“Lady Clarke, wife of our State Governor,
was expected to be present at a meeting of the
Spinners held the other day at ‘ Myoora,’ Toorak.
The members rolled up in large numbers, but no
Lady Clarke. At last came a message from the
waited one saying that she could not, as the
Governor’s wife, visit a private house. Lady
Brassey must have been very incorrect, as
she observed no such rule. It is a pity that
Captain Better-not-Wallington is not on the
State Governor’s staff; for he is the greatest
authority in Australia—barring Lord Hopetoun—
on points of etiquette, and could have saved the
misunderstanding and delay.
* The Quixotic Marshall-Hall has been airing
his views in students’ ciroles as to the dress of
Dairies. As usual, he is downright, humorous,
very much in earnest. The shaggy giant of
musical Melbourne disapproves of the long,
shimmering, diaphanous drapery in vogue among
the stage fairies of the present day. He likes to
see the limbs free of trappings, even the vaguest,
most transparent trappings—but compromises
with the proprieties by favoring the old-fashioned
lamp-shade frills—those rigid starch tiers of silk
and lace that stand out from the hips, and leave
the limbs their honest exposition. If any of the
Marshall-Hall devotees turn stage fairies, we may
expect them to resurrect the brief bright frills
denoted above.
“ Different circles of Melbourne are in a flutter
over the blazing of Hymen’s torch next week.
Toorak bristles up over the swagger knot-tying of
merchant Robert Harper’s daughter with Mr. A.
Taylor, one of several straight-backed, long-
nosed, stiff-necked brothers. Thespians rustle
over the matrimonial stakes of the hardy Jim
M'Evoy, and stylish Evelyn Muret, the fair lady
who exchanges the life of a chorus charmer for
that of elderly, gilded domestic bliss. The third
section. of expectant Melbourne is engaged in the
discussion of young barrister Clive Morrison’s
marriage with a Murchison girl, Miss Dyer, who
makes music better than anyone else in that part of
the State. Young Morrison is the youngest mem-
ber of the Geelong College family which has given
two clever brothers to the world, and is a tall,
lean, blue-eyed youth. The marriage takes place
in .the R.C. church at Murchison, and is to be
quiet. The Morrisons are all Anglican.
“ All last week a constant stream of she-mum-
mers were pilgrimming to a certain drapery estab-
lishment to worship at the shrine of a trousseau.
Excitement ran high.. The costly laces, the
sheeny silks, the choice textures, the dressing-
gowns, the kimonos, the dinner blouses, to say
nothing of the real lace-decked sleeping-gowns,
suggested that all the gold of Midas had been
available to the purchaser. No actress ever
before started on a wedded career in Melbourne
with such a wardrobe. All the sister mummers
are gasping in. wonder. The man’s properties?
Oh, no one is invited to examine them. A
bachelor’s luxury only runs to fancy braces, silk-
reins of leadership.
‘“Dr. Bill’s’ first night (April 19th), tended to
smart frocking neither on the stage nor off.
Mrs. Brough dressed the doctor’s ex-actress
patient for visiting in grey-silk skirt, with
red-velvet stripes and red-velvet jacket, while
indoors she trailed round in pale-blue satin,
built on redingote lines. Miss Temple’s version
of the plumage of a “ frivolity ” houri was all-
red. In real life one rarely meets an actress off
the boards in scarlet or yellow. Mrs. Bland Holt
has been seen at the races in orange-sarsenet, but
white, especially white muslin, seems the most
popular private wear with ladies of the pro-
fession. Of course, they all wear their white
with a difference. Nellie Stewart tricks out
her ‘ blancherie ’ with Frenchy freaks, turquoise
trinkets, and rose-trimmed millinery. On the
other hand, ‘ butter won’t melt in the mouth,’ so
to speak, of Ada Willoughby’s innocent little bit
of white dimity. Grace Palotta and Aadyth
Latimer, also fond of the virginal color, don their
lawns and laces with an eye to more medium
effect.
“Emma Temple had a chance of airing her
figure in some dressy gowns in the ‘ Tyranny of
Tears.’ A pale-mustard silk was a success, also a
white satin, chiffon-edged, was a fair fact, and a
swagger powder-pink evening cloak, cut in points
and bordered with black laoe, was another pleas-
ing truth. Emma has, however, put on some hip-
padding, which worries her terribly. It is s 0
obviously detachable; in fact, this scribe
thought of pneumatic tyres every time the hard
round-tubed padding caught her eye. Miss
Temple, in other respects, adheres to the small-
waisted, primed-up figure, and her dresses fit
faultlessly. But that patent padding made her
look 15 years too old for the character. Mrs.
Brough played the role of secretary in a cornflower-
blue garb, of a severe description ; later in a black
circumscribed evening frock ; and, lastly, in a
Poverty-pointing white muslin. A fair wig was
a real relief—Mrs. Brough is so seldom blonde.
“Last night of the ‘Runaway Girl’ (April
18th) little Maud Chetwynd (Mrs. What’s-her-
name), in Florence Young’s place as the fugitive
convent-miss, looked the school-belle to the life,
thanks to smart, spry feet, and extra-straight
back, but her song-efforts were piteously flat
and faint-hearted. If little Chetwynd had
altered the start of the Runaway’s first song
to ‘l’m only a little dancing girl,’ it would
have packed her pleas for indulgence into a nut-
shell.
Kenningham looked very glum at the ‘ Run-
away’s ’ farewell. He’s docked in his solo allow-
ance nowadays, and Florence Young’s absence
that night spoilt his one vocal chance—the duet,
‘ I think ’twould break my heart! ’ Lauri parted
from the ‘ Runaway ’ in great fettle for waggery
or gaggery—the two words don’t always mean the
same thing. Gags tend to put fellow-mu turners
out in their words, as Hugh Ward found that
night. But Ward, as a funny man, is said to find
no favor in Lauri’s eyes. A while ago, when he
and Maud Chetwynd worked up a ‘cane-dance,’
it was regarded by some as poaching on the Moore-
Lauri preserves.
“In the d.c. on ‘Runaway's’ last night was
John Forrest’s liege-lady, wearing grey-cloth
theatre-cloak, its yoke stamped out in little holes
oyer white satin. With her came her Westralian
visitors—the widow and daughters of her late
brother, one of the Hammersleys. The Misses
Haminersley are tall, rather elegant girls, in a
quiet way, with simple, ‘no-side’ manners. Old
John Forrest, with no bairns of his own, likes
someone young about him, and these nieces have
had a gay time in Melbourne before now under
his wing. Just at present they’re only with the
Forrests for a few days at the Grand, as they are
off to Maoriland, where the elder sister is anxiously
awaited by her bridegroom-elect, Dr. Logan.
The ‘Six Families ’ begin to disperse. Before the
scatter began, the eldest sister of these girls paired
off with a Lefroy and lives near the home of her
youth and the tombs of the Six Families, but her
juniors go farther to fare as well, let us hope.
“ A packed house melted at the ‘ Dorothy ’ first
night. Carrie Moore heaved her shoulders out of a
white satin frock and the left hand box, to applaud
her chums in the show. Blanche Wallace starred
it in the front row of the stalls, where circles and
gods had the chance of admiring her generous
figure and rare white shoulders in an eye-stunning
frock of blue. The theatrical McEvoy party, with
Evelyn Muret its particular pet, fronted the stalls.
There, too, Mrs. Lawson, blazing in diamonds, sat
with her husband. The circle had a ‘swagger’if
less interesting bevy. Miss Hilda Cumming, in a
delicate blue frock and a garniture of pink roses,
was the fairest and the plumpest target for first-
night starers. Dandy Croker’s second daughter,
about to debut, looked lily-fair in pale pink. Her
fair thatch was a charming structure. A Sydney
matron, sporting a Romney curl in straw-coiored
strands and a wonderfully shaded complexion in
rare art tints, was a-glimmer with many iridescent
ornaments in front of the circle.
“ Benjamin Hoare, who commands the Roman
Catholic young men of Victoria and adjacent
States to holy and pious practices when he’s not
leader-writing for the Age, has married a rather
religious lady of Irish parentage, who, however,
leavens her holiness with the humor of her race.
Benjamin is tall, but his new wife is half a head
higher in the world, and, though leagues past
girlhood, beams over with kittenishness.
“ Betrothals are a long-drawn-out matter, as a
rule, in Toorak; and it was a severe shock to see
the marriage notice of Miss May Dempster to one
Mr. Geo. Dunlop Jackson before the announce-
ment of the engagement. The affair has a savour
of romance in it. The marriage blossomed out of
a board-ship acquaintance and the pair were
wedded at the first stopping-place on the line,
which happened to be Bombay. Miss Dempster
was doing the Indian trip with another maiden
sister ; both have nice annuities by the grace and
benevolence of their late brother-in-law, Wesley -
Hall.
“ Grace Palotta was switched-on to ornament a
stall at a swagger handkerchief fair out St. Kilda
way on Saturday last, and the goldfish bit all
right. Similar attractions are billed for a needle-
work show to take place at Prahran next week,
and _ Miss Duff, Lady Hutton, Miss Muriel
Williams, Miss R. Madden and a galaxy of smart
girls are promised to be on show for the occasion.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Noble phrase by Senator Stewart: “ Mr.
Barton is going to London to stew in—smaok !
rich Imperial gravy.”
In appearance, Cecil Rhodes was a mix-
ture of Pilcher, K. 0., and the late C. A. Goodchap,
erstwhile manager of N.S.W. railways.
There is, after all, something to be said
for Kings. The only male teetotaller on a throne
in the oivilised world is the Sultan of Turkey.
“Steele Rudd” (A. H. Davis) is now
Acting Under-Sheriff at Brisbane. Quite a
different class of stock gets shorn on his present
selection.
The fact about George Reid is that he is
only capable of a certain number of jokes, and he
sensibly keeps those for juries now ; hence a fall-
ing political reputation.
Crick is the first Lands Minister who has
ever, while in office, visited the Far Western
(N.S.W.) country. And even Crick legislates for
it first and visits it afterwards.
Sydney D.T. now prints its distinguished
boss among guests at a banquet as “Mr. J. R-
Carey.” It used to be “Major J. Randal Carey
(President of the Daily Telegraph). ’
The estate of Thomas Broughton, a
Hawkesbury native, and Mayor of Sydney m
1847, who died a few months since, aged 91 years,
has been sworn for probate at £47,247 7s. sd.
In allusion to “Blot” Braddon’s champion-
ship of Senator Hartnoll (Tas.), in the recent by®'
election, a Melbourne paper recalls the time when
Braddon dubbed Hartnoll “a greasy semaphore.
John Forrest’s wife is working tirelessly
to secure the High Commissionership for her hus-
band. The story goes that Turner, Deakm,
O’Connor and Barton favor the appointment of
Wise.
A man arrested for using bad language in
the street was brought before a Sydney Bench.
“What’s the man charged with?” enquired the
Magistrate. “The Hutton habit,” replied the
sargint.
Thomas Thompson, aged 92, who died at
Eden (N.S.W.), last week, was, for seven years,
convict-overseer at Norfolk Island (1839-46) under
some rough commandants. He had lived at Eden
for 55 years.
Chief-Justice Darley’s leave of absence and
Justice M. H. Stephen’s retirement will now
bring Justice Owen into the acting N.S.W. C.-J.-
ship. Mr. Owen before missed the C.-J.-ship by a
mere fluke. He was on a tour when Chief-Justice
Martin died, and an offer of the position was
cabled him, but he had left for Australia before
its transmission. Mr. Owen was called to the Bar
in 1859 and was appointed Judge in 1887.
Some N.S.W. public-service statistics :
N.S.W. public-service list, just issued, covers all the
big departments, except the railways and post-office. Of
named officers, Auditor-General Rennie is senior ; he first
sat on a Govt, stool in ’46, long before most of the Under-
Secs, were
born. The Un-
der-Secs. of to-
day are, how-
ever, unusu-
ally juvenile.
The perma-
nent heads of
the Works and
Lands are in
the forties;
and the secre-
tary to the
Attorney-Gen-
eral has not
attained even
that much
venerableness.
Principal Un-
der - Secretary
Walker, who is
generally sup-
posed to have
grown up in
a Govt, office
since the early
part of last
century, is, as
a matter of
fact, beaten in
point of ser-
vice by several.
Mr. Bridges,
of the Public
Service Board,
put in just
under 60 years
with the Edu-
cation Depart-
ment ; he join-
ed it as a pupil
teacher the
first male one
in N.S.W.—in
*52, at the ma-
ture age of 12.
This depart-
ment, by the
way, is the
home of old
stagers; sev-
eral of the offi-
cers have been
there over 40
years. The
Lands Dept.,
on the other
hand, is offi-
cered by new-
chums with no
more than 30
years against
them ; that is
Under - Sec.
Onrry’s term.
The Govt.
SOLICITOR CROKE R—“ The
last of Melbourne's dandies .”
Printery is another refuge for the ancient. This
year Mr. Griffiths, super, of the office, will soon
complete his half-century there. If any man m N.S.W.
knows his work it ought to be A. C. Budge, clerk of the
Executive Council, who has held that dozy billet for 38
years. Astronomer Russell has done his 43rd year ; like an
orderly mathematician he began on Jan. 1. Mr. Caswell,
P.M. and Warden, dates back to ’47 ; of the S.M. s Mr.
Mair has 40 years service and Mr. Edwards 39. Like the
Lands, the Mines is mostly officered by new-chums—
Under-Sec. McLachlan joined in ’69, Geologist Pittman in
77, and Chief-Inspector Slee in ’76.
The election of cold-water Canon Boyce to
be president of the newly-formed N.S.W. British
Empire League spells disaster to that cause.
There can be no British Empire without grog-
shops—and lots of ’em.
At Heidelberg, near Melbourne, three
brothers got married at one gathering the other
week. No explanation of this epidemic was
published, except perhaps the fact that the
brethren were grandsons of Rev. D. Fraser.
The refusal of Reid and M'Millan to
attend Prime Minister Barton’s farewell dinner
seems rather paltry, for they can’t with any
grace give, as a reason for the refusal, that the
affair is mostly I. R. Cohen and T. M. Slattery.
The S.A. Parliamentary returning officer
has had to order a special size in ballot paper for
Torrens to accommodate “ Dankel, George Caspar
Adolph Maria Prosper.” By the way, Maria is
also the front name of S. Australia’s military
panjandrum Gordon.
Representative Glynn had a birthday on
Friday of this week, and Papa Brunker will have
one to-morrow (Sunday). Glynn constantly
threatens to leave politics and attend to his law-
practice, but the legislative-habit is as engrossing
as the morphia-habit.
Hartnoll (Tas.), the latest arrival in the
House of Reps., is known as “ Windy William.”
And this most deservedly, as witnesseth his
maiden speech, on which he was ironically con-
gratulated. But Hobart Mercury took the
congratulations quite seriously.
Prime Minister Barton, when an under-
Si. at Sydney University, won the “Cooper
olarship” No. 1, of £5O, for classics. This
was in 1867. Thirty-five years afterwards, he has
-the unique experience of seeing this same scholar-
ship awarded to his second son.
Mr. Crick is said to be at serious “logger-
heads ” with the other members of N. S. W. Cabinet.
Noted that at the Ministerial anniversary lunch
not only was he absent, but the Premier, whilst
mentioning eulogistically all his other colleagues,
made no reference to the Lands Minister.
Judge Casey has determined to see the
Coronation. As a reporter Casey was “great on ”
sights. Weddings and funerals were his choice
functions when a junior on the N.Y. press. As a
member of the Victorian country press his agri-
cultural-show reports were florid masterpieces.
Methuen, the champion unlucky man of
the Boer war, happens to have been the only
British general in the campaign who was a pupil
of the famous and ever-victorious Von Moltke.
Ketchener 'saw service (under Chanzy, on the
Loire) in opposition to Moltke in the war of 1870-
71.
E. W. O’Sullivan now writes verse about
Our own, our native land !
Their much-loved early homes our fathers left, land of
their choice, for thee ;
Yet still count it their proudest boast Britannia’s sons to
be.
Of their choice ? It was a case of Hobson’s choice
with many of ’em ; hence the name Hobson’s Bay.
“ Janny” Leahy, Q. Minister for Railways,
who objects to the wives of Ms.L.A. travelling
gratis on the railways with their husbands, hails
from Cork, Ireland. He has been nearly 30 years
in Queensland, and succeeded so well at country
storekeeping that he is now President of Brisbane
Chamber of Commerce. He is under 50 years of
age.
Lord Tennyson strongly objects to being
snap-shotted —especially with his hat off, for his
thatch is thin—and exciting contests take place
between His Ex. and the photographers for the
illustrated papers. At a recent function he dodged
incessantly, but was at last corralled, for, being
surrounded by the camera brigade, he had to face
one of them.
“Lex ” to The Bulletin :
It is not a fact that Justice Hodges (Vic.) was once a
curate. He studied with a view to taking holy orders,
when a young man, but before passing any examination
he decided, after consultation with Chief Justice Stawell,
to abandon the Church for the Bar, on the ground that
he was afflicted with infirmity of temper.
Talk about humor!
Governor-General Hopetoun, who has
strong ambitions to be useful, is often saddened
by the thought that his physique doesn’t match
his aspirations. “ Here am I,” said he the other
day, “an earl, rich, Governor of the Common-
wealth, and yet what’s the good of it after all ?
I’ve got no ” well, he didn’t say “ bingey ” but
put it in Saxon. It’s a familiar story—the spirit
willing, the flesh weak.
Senator Symon is almost as well acquainted
with Shakespeare as with his law-books, and is
quite as apt at quotation from him. For one
thing, he rigidly adheres to the rule which reli-
giously excludes any reference to his office work
from his beautiful country home at “Manoah,” on
the hills near Adelaide, whereas Shakespeare has
free access into his law chambers.
King O’Malley, Tasmania’s picturesque
contribution to the House of Reps., is said to have
inaugurated a religious sect in America, in his
book-canvassing days there. The sect is known
as the “Water Lilies.” O’Malley looks like a
man who could and might inaugurate a new
religion, and “Water Lilies ” is something like the
title a man like him would think of.
Macnamara, hanged the other day in
Melbourne, had tried to burn his wife alive in
their wooden cottage iii order to recover the £250
for which they were jointly insured—the money
payable to either of them on the death of the
other. Now, he having been officially “ scragged”
for this she gets the £250. Which seems to have
a peculiar fitness about it somewhere.
A pretty close approach to perpetual-
motion was attained by a Mr. Beverley, of
Dunedin (M.L.) in 1860. He invented a clock
which worked without any other impulse than
that derived from temperature-changes. A glass
cylinder filled with air, resting on a surface of
castor oil, supplies the power, every change in
temperature changing the pressure. The force thus
generated is taken-up by an ingenious mechanical
contrivance and carried to the works. The clock
has been going for over 40 years and will probably
keep on until it wears out.
AT THE ZOO.
Meyer Blashki, a young Australian, late of
Sydney, seems to have impressed New York, per
medium of a landscape shown by him at the Lotos
Club exhibition. The local Journal, of March 4,
prints a column appreciation of the “new man in
our art,” by Henri Pene du Bois. Certainly
H. P. D. Bois, as a writer, is an unspeakable
driveller —a dealer in the worst sort of pretentious
shoddy—but he may know more of art than of
letters.
Alfred Yon Doussa, secretary of Onka-
paringa Racing Club, who stands for a delight-
fully Tory S.A. Council district, described the
Household Suffrage Bill, in turf vernacular, as “ a
black gelding by Kingston out of Bluff.” His
general views on politics are just about as lumin-
ous as that, but he is “a jolly good fellow” with
countless admirers, and so is likely to win on the
ancient Tory stallion Selfishness by Impudence
out of Rapacity.
Another budding Australian artist, known
to Bulletin readers, Fred Brown, left for England
last Friday, per s.s. Aberdeen. Young Brown,
who has so far devoted himself to the cheerful
occupation of depicting scenes in Shcol, goes ’Ome
full of confidence. He is working his passage,
and has decided to fight it out in * 4 black and
white ” when he reaches London. He will live in
a garret, and stab at the alleged comic papers till
a living happens along.
A re marque proof of Tom Roberts
picture of the opening of the Federal Parliament
has been ordered by the Prince of Wales—which
is an excellent poster advt. for the venture.
Roberts’ canvas is 17ft. by 10, into which space
he has contracted to crowd all the Senators,
Reps., and distinguished visitors. Melb. Age
says it promises to be an artistic success. At best
it can only be a clever solution of a problem, but
it will go on its face value.
Dean O’Haran’s show for the Bendigo
(Vic.) see “is thought good.” Dr. Reville, the
retiring bishop, is a many years’ friend, and as the
Cardinal and Dr. O’Haran will be in Rome when
the appointment comes under consideration in-
fluences (if the Cardinal has real influence) are
sure to be favorable. Dr. Crane, the first Bishop
of Sandhurst, died blind ; Dr. Reville retires after
a brief term in ill-health ; but the diocese still
enjoys the thumping legacy bequeathed by the
late Dr. Backhaus.
A venerable Protestant Dean (now defunct)
of an Australian capital hailed originally from
“ the Black North,” and was vividly anti-Roman.
He met Brown, one day, who told him of Jones’
secession from “ the Church ” that he had verted
to Roman Catholicism. Gloomily the Dean
shook his head. Next day again he and Brown
met, and the latter explained that Jones after
leaving “ the Church ” had not become a Holy
Roman, but an Atheist. “Thank God! came
from the full heart of the relieved Dean.
From a Tommy’s letter (not about the
Buccaneers—the regulars this time) :
“ I went to see Commandant Scheepers shot last Satur-
day at three o’clock. They brought him from towiyn an
ambulance van with a band playing, and the firing party
following behind. When they got him to his grave he
begged to be allowed to stand up and face death. Rut
they tied him down in a chair, and blindfolded him, and
15 of the Coldstream Guards stood ten paces from him
and fired. It almost blew one side of him away, and it
was a sickening sight. He must have been a brave man.
He did not flinch, nor turn pale. They buried him as he
was, and broke the chair up, throwing the pieces on top
of him.”
Premier Seddon at the Sydney banquet
(reads like “Alice in Wonderland”): —
lam about to proceed to South Africa. I received a
communication the other day from Colonel Porter, who
said he had been speaking to Lord Kitchener about me,
and the Commander-in-Ohief said he would like to see
me I take that as a command, and, notwithstanding
the risk of capture by the Boers, I shall do my
best to meet General Kitchener—one in whom we have
every confidence.
Perhaps Ketchener did say it, or perhaps the
gallant Porter was pulling Bun Tuck’s leg. Any-
how, if Ketchener did say it he has probably for-
gotten by now. ■
A fair chance offered tha
other day for settlement _of
the implacable enmity
between a prominent'
Melb. newspaper
proprietor and a
fat and politi-
cally-useless
local M.P.
The two are
suburban next
door neigh-
bors. The politi-
cian found hi#
garden overbur-
dened with
tomatoes, rad
promised to send
a cwt. or so to
the occupant of
a house at the
rear of his resi-
dence. The gar-
dener misunder-
stood instructions,
however, and the
M.P. was horrified
to discover that his
gift had been sent,
“ with his compli-
ments,” to the dour
newspaper-man next
door. Rumor has it
that his attention
was first called to the
mistake by the ap-
parition of the cool
and methodic rag-
owner shying tomatoes
one by one over the fence
on to his front verandah.
If report speaks truly, Gov-
ernor Havelock, of Tasmania,
does not intend to be a Governor
in name only ; he seems dangerously
inclined to take himself as a ruler quite
seriously. The other day he is said to
have soundly rated a prisoner working
in Govt. House grounds for not toiling
hard enough. The man explained that he was
Buffering from a jarred hand or something. The
Gov. evidently considered this a mere tale (as it
possibly was), and ordered the doctor to examine
the alleged hurt. The doctor confirmed the
Gov.’s suspicions, and the prisoner was punished
for malingering. Minus the cat, it reads like h
chapter of old-time history.
The undertaker’s paragraph by cable to
the Australian great dailies:
The wailing of the natives while sacrificing oxen at Mr.
Rhodes’ funeral was very touching.
But why omit the usually inevitable: "The whole
of the funeral arrangements were personally super-
vised by Mr. A. B. I). Smith ? ”
Sydney Animals’ Protection Society,
through its secretary, has complained of the
miserable weediness of the screws bought by the
Commonwealth Govt, for the last contingent.
The secretary says he would have stopped at least
60 of the 300, had he had the power.
Hiram Maxim has offered a prize of
£50,000 for a successful flying-machine, which
must not be a balloon. This should gladden the
Australian flying-machine cranks, of whom there
are quite a number—including a Sydneyite who,
for 25 years, has spent all his money and all his
spare time over his fad.
The American methods in the Philippines
seem to far out-ketch Ketchener. Mr. J. A.
Hobson, in London Daily News, charges :
Devastation and reconcentration, the death penalty for
any aid or comfort to an enemy, and even, as serious wit-
nesses allege, the deliberate and frequent use of torture
to extract evidence, have all been transferred from
Spanish to American practice along with the transference
of a policy of national obliteration.
And sworn evidence before an American commit-
tee of inquiry seems to bear out Mr. Hobson’s
charges.
Dear Bulletin. — Some enthusiastic idiot
has been pulling the legs of the Sydney morning
papers, even to the length of a column apiece, anent
a wonderful new locomotive valve-gear, and now
writer smiles to see Bulletin (12th inst.) also drawn
in. Excitement began with London Times, Feb. 20,
when Mr. Cautley, M.P., announced to a breath-
less world that “ we are on the eve of a mechanical
revolution such as has never been seen since the
introduction of steam.” Bare fact is that valves,
working on principles old in stationary and marine
engineering, have been applied to locomotives, and
not for the first time either; and a small economy
has resulted. Steam engineers familiar with
thermodynamics are pleased to get a small
economy, because it is all they expect, but it is no
use to offer the public less than a Revolution every
time. — Herbert R.
The execution of arsonist Macnamara at
Melbourne was a shapeless and disorganised epi-
sode. A little over an hour before the “ dull,
sickening thud ” was to eventuate, Macnamara
ran across his cell and violently banged his head
against the barred door, inflicting a serious wound
and causing unconsciousness. Spur doctors were
hastily summoned, but for long it looked as if the
law would have to hang an unconscious man or
postpone the function. And the law hates to nang
anybody while he is in merciful oblivion. But the
unwearied efforts of science prevailed, and at the
appointed time a patched and plastered criminal,
with knocking knees and ashen face, was sup-
ported by two warders on to the stage to perform
his part before a select audience of about 30.
Related —was it of Jay Gould 1- that his
handwriting was so bad as to be illegible to the
old man himself. A letter of his replying to an
application for employment on one of his numer-
ous railways was, on the strength of the signature,
used by the recipient as a pass over the line for
many years. In later days the typewriter has
done much to prevent fraud and mistakes formerly
traceable to bad writing. Had J.G., like The
Bulletin, used a “ New Century ’ machine his
reputation as a letter-writer would be better to-
day New Century Typewriters, the latest from
Yankee-land, are sold by the United Typewriter
and Supplies Cos., of Sydney, Melbourne and
Perth.*

MALLEE-COOKING IN SUMMER.
“ Didn't I tell ye to turn this meat !"
“ W’y, mother, I’m baked dry myself :
“A.G.F.”: During this severe drought
the ground has cracked to such an extent on what
were swampy places on this station (Wilberoi,
N.S.W.), that I often find sheep dead and dying,
stuck in the cracks, same as if they were bogged.
Have noticed during this awful season the common
black-and-white magpie picking the eyes out of
sheep that were not able to get up. I never saw
it before ; has any other man on the land observed
it?

“ Scotty the Wrinkler ” re the human-
ostrich par., B. 12/4/’O2 :
It is as well to mention names, dates, and facts, so
here goes : I have seen several army officers eat up wine-
glasses, notably CElrichs, 35th Foot, at Mooltan (1866). I
backed him to eat a lamp-shade, if he’d tackle it. In
1873, at table, in a Macquarie-st., Sydney, house, I made
that statement, and the house-mother publicly derided
me, but, referring to Mr. L. A. Fosbery, late of
the R.N., now of Wagga, she was informed that he had
often seen it done. Old Kilmartin, a Riverina fencer, con-
stantly ate glass for liquor. He was named the “ Glass-
eater.” There is a myth that ground-glass will kill dogs;
another, that it will kill worms in dogs ; still another,
that it will make dogs fight— all myths.

M.L. Govt., which professes to discounte-
nance the exportation of Maori curios, was
recently offered the magnificent collection of
Major General Robley in England, but didn’t
even reply to the offer. Robley has now sold
elsewhere at a much higher figure. He still has a
gruesome collection of 32 preserved Maori heads,
elaborately tattooed, for which a Yankee museum
is in treaty.
“ R.R.R.” : “ Tahune Linah’s ” par re
human ostrioh (8., 12/4/’O2), reminds me of the
man who, in Southern Riverina, about 10 years
ago, gave himself up to the police, saying that he
had tried to suicide by swallowing a lot of broken
glass. He was taken 25 miles to the nearest
doctor, who, though incredulous, put the patient
on a diet of bread and cheese, with very little
water, and then, after a few days, administered a
large dose of castor-oil. Result, 60-odd pieces of
broken bottle. Fact. The man was afterwards
tried at Deniliquin for attempted suicide.

A voice which can’t be disregarded begins
to make itself heard in Maoriland. The curse of
the North Island bush settler will shortly disturb
the jingo Premier in his sleep. Owing to the cost
of cohentingenting not only has the making of
roads been stopped, but those that are already
made are falling into disrepair, and the bush
backblock settler finds difficulty in getting his
produce to the railway. The North Island is a
country in which a road has to be heavily metalled
every year or in winter it becomes impassable and
the lonely settler and his team—wagon, produce
and everything—simply vanish, only to be found
next summer when the sun has dried the mud and
the loud nor’-wester has swept it away in clouds,
and left it in drifts along the edge of the nearest
bush.

This, from a London paper, will interest
Australian drovers:
A stampede of cattle can usually be stopped by strewing
some salt on the ground in front of the cattle. When the
cattle reach the salt they invariably stop and lick the
ground where the salt is.
They have frequently been stopped by this method in
South America.
Please note that the salt is to be put in front of
the cattle—not on their tails.

Examination of a large number of moa
bones found in a swamp near Wanganui River
(M.L.) tended to show that the big bird has not
been so long extinct as has been supposed. The
bones were found under 3ft. of bog earth, in a
layer Ift. 6in. in thickness, underlain by a foot of
river deposit, and natural grease was found in
many of them. They were mostly leg-bones, and
it is surmised that a large number of the birds got
bogged in the flood-deposit, their bodies, as they
decayed, being washed away.

“Fortuna”: Re animals living on “dry-
tack ” and in close confinement. The following
from Captain M‘Clintock’s diary of his voyage in
the Fox may bear reprinting:
A few days ago [Sept., 1858],
a large cask of biscuits was
opened, and a living mouse
discovered therein ! It was
small, but mature in years.
The cask —a strong, watertight
one —was packed on shore, at
Aberdeen, in June, 1857, and
remained ever after unopened ;
there was no hole by which the
mouse could have got in or out;
besides, it is the only one seen
on board. Ship’s biscuit is
certainly dry feeding ; but who
dares assert, after the experi-
ences of our mouse, that it is
not wonderfully nutritious.
“H.J. Re finding the cardinal points
on a cloudy day (“ Cecil P.,” B. 12/4/’O2). It’s a
poor bushman that, in timbered country, can’t
find north and south. The thin-barked, sun-
burned side is invariably due north from an
imaginary line passing through the tree from the
centre of the rough, thick-barked side, which is
always the south side. No blackpheller ever
resorted to “C.P.’s” , penknife and-thumbnail
device. Even on a timberless plain every shrub or
weed has its north side distinctly indicated to a

“ J.A.C.” : Re getting the sun on a cloudy
day (“ Cecil P., B. 12/4/’O2). There is a simple
way of getting the cardinal points without a com-
pass if one has a watch. Hold the watch as
nearly horizontal as possible, dial uppermost, and
in the guard-ring insert, say, a pencil, perpen-
dicularly, at right angles to the dial. Then turn
the watch until the shadow cast by the pencil falls
across from the 12 to the 6, and the hour hand
will then point due north, if the watch is correct
time.

“ nlick ” ; How is this to show the fer-
tility of land in the back country with the aid of
a little bore-water and manual labor. At Wal-
gett, last Jan. —with the glass playing round 113
in the shade —a selector who has a drain of bore-
water running through his selection decided to
plough and irrigate 40 acres to grow sorghum.
Within nine weeks he had a crop lift, high, which
he estimates will cut 20 tons to the acre. He will
be able to keep his 5000 sheep on this for at least
four months.
The Boyces, Langleys, and
other lemonade-drinking N.S.
Wales church-builders should
keep in their mind’s eye the
historic bill of the Rev. Richard
Johnson, builder of Sydney’s
first church. Rev. Johnson was
of frugal mind, so he sent his
account for raising the humble
structure to the British Govt.,
and, after years of backstairs-
influenoe, he got paid. His
filed account runs :—“ Paid
workmen 20| gallons spirits,
116ewt. flour, 18|lb. pork, 35Jlb.
beef, 51b. tobacco, 31b. tea.”
Pastor Johnson (his church
paid for in kind, cost a little
over £74) argued that liquor was
local currency, and that if he
waited for sober men to build
a church N.S.W. would never
possess such a structure.

Bolting horses in city
streets cause thousands of acci-
dents. A recent invention, a
stiff leather sheath to clasp the
whole of the foreleg of a sta-
tionary horse, preventing the
bending of the knee, promises
to be fairly effectual, but does
not meet the case of the trades-
man’s cart. Too much time
would be wasted.

“C.L.”: Coming down
from the West per C.Q.R., and
getting into the tick-quarantine
area, two ladies entered the carriage, with some
children prettily dressed, for town. One young-
ster kept rubbing its eyes and blinking, till the
mother leant forwards and got something out of
its eyes with the aid of a handkerchief. She also
picked something off the children’s clothes here
and there, and opened her hand to show cattle
ticks! “I can’t keep them off,” she explained.
“We nave a patch of grass near the house, and
the children will play on it. I really think there
is nothing for it but dip them.”

Dear Bulletin.—Two true horse yarns.
In ’6B I rode a three-year-old unbroken filly into
Wollindilly River, Burragorang, and when she
got out of her depth she simply walked across on
the bottom. She did the same thing on my re-
crossing the river. Once afterwards, in the Mur-
rumbidgee River, near Queanbeyan, in ’74, an
aged mare I was swimming across sank 14ft. to
the bottom, like a stone, but came up again
instantly and swam across all right.—H. J.
M‘Cooey.
A tree was recently struck by lightning at
Yeppoon (Q.), and an iron bolt, which had
been driven into the timber when young,
was propelled with great force through
the window of an adjacent house—
smashing a pickle-bottle on the table.

T’other day a Yic. farmer, after bath-

had eaten his shirt and under-shirt; also
that the leg of his pants was disappearing down

A strange discovery was made by a Gover-
nor’s Bay (M.L.) settler. While sawing through
a big blue-gum tree, a mass of honeycomb and
dead bees was found in the heart of it. How they
got there is one of Nature’s mysteries.
SKETCH ON MONOINDI ROAD (Q.)
A ring-barking party on the wallaby.
“The M‘C.” : I knew a dog once which
was bitten nine times in two years by venomous
snakes and became poison-imune. The second
time he was bitten he was very bad, and lay in
the river groaning and lapping the water for over
16 hours. After that he suffered very little. I
had him bitten by a captured tiger-snake, and he
went to the river, lay in the water an hour or so,
and then became all right again. The same even-
ing I let loose the snake in a clear spot, and the
dog, in worrying it, was bitten several times but
suffered not at all.

“I want to send a telegram to mg wife."
“Well, write it at that desk,
“ But, yer see, the old woman can't read my writin’. I’d like
you to write it .”
“ C.W.” sends this to The Bulletin
Who has not read of the mobile Boers, each one with a
yard or two of biltong looped lasso-like on his saddle,
with a similar length of twisted tobacco-leaf, a huge pipe,
his weapons—and no more ? He sleeps nightly in a farm-
house, or failing that, in the stable, with his faithful
steed at his side, and at cock-crow is off (after a hearty
breakfast cooked by the vrow and kinder) in search of
fresh kopjes and soldiers new. Now, what would happen
to “ Joe” Boer, if he were a Maoriland contingenter?
They would give him a slouch-hat, a field-service-cap
(which would destroy his sight or get him a sunstroke if
he wore it); two uniforms (one for church-parade), three
shirts, three pairs drawers, three under-shirts, three
cholera-belts (most useful of all), two pairs boots,' two
pairs shoes, a hold-all, a “ housewife ” (for sewing-gear,
etc.), several pairs socks, handkerchiefs galore,
one tin blacking, two boot-brushes, a large knife
on a lanyard to hang round his neck, a tooth-
brush, and stick, an overcoat, three blankets, a
waterproof-sheet, and a sack. For his horse he has saddle
and bridle, surcingle and pad, blanket, picketing-rope
and peg, heel-rope, headstall and rope, brush and curry-
comb, nosebag and hay-nets. Then, with rifle, bayonet,
bucket, bandolier and pouches with 150 rounds of ammu-
nition, haversack containing a tin canteen and a day’s
provisions, water-bottle, hay-nets full, and feed of
oats in his nosebag, it would take an elephant
to hump the lot with any kind of ease. Un-
officially, also, he would have with him other matters
—including, probably, a batch of photos, a ream or so of
letters—and loot. But does he take all this to the front ?
Not he. At the first landing-station, dump goes all but
one blanket, the waterproof sheet, a change of under-
clothing, and the horse necessaries. Could M.L. Govern-
ment but realise this, and also the fact that fortunes are
being made out of the tons and tons of clothing wasted
in S’Africa every month, there would be less trouble in
the despatch of contingents, and considerable diminution
in the little bill Maoriland will have to foot one of these
days.

“Right Angle” : There is a noticeable
difference between the King Country Maori and
the dweller on the coast. The latter is copper-
color, but the Kinglander inclines to blackness.
The coast native is phlegmatic, thick-set, and has
rounded limbs. The King Country native is full
of bottled energy, quick in movement, and wild-
eyed. His limbs are inclined to flatness. He is,
on an average, longer in the limb and finer at the
extremities. The hair is thick, and mopped like
a Fijian’s. Neither type is particularly trust-
worthy, but, if you have to choose, take the coast
native. Unless driven by necessity, however,
don’t take either.”
A GAOL-WALL INSCRIPTION.
A volley-crack, a puflf of smoke,
And dead the Murderer grins,
-Come, cover with the Charity-cloak
That multitude of sins.
And though some blame and count it shame
I won’t withhold the tear
For the cold heart, the bold heart
That ceased its beating here.
They say his debts he oft forgot,
—But-one he settled up,
They say he used to drink a lot,
—His last was a bitter cup.
And right or wrong, or weak or strong,
I can’t keep back the tear
For the Devil-heart, the revel-heart
That ceased its beating here.
I know he went from bad to worse,
I know what ill he wrought,
But I have seen him on a horse,
And heard of how he fought;
And, fool or wise, I own my eyes
Are troubled with a tear
For the rough heart, the tough heart
That ceased its beating here.
A sorry life of drink and debt,
That finished with the shrift
Men give the murderer, and yet
Was his the singer’s gift ;
A scrap of song ’gainst a world of wrong 1
I know—but here’s a tear
For the Crime-heart, the Rhyme-her
That ceased its beating here.
Some heels may spurn “ The Breaker’s” grave,
Some mouths thereon may spit,
But some have owned to hands that gave
A wreath to even it;
And here’s a meed of poor word-weed
Would fain express the tear
For that Other-heart, that Brother-heart
That ceased its beating here.

“ Trotter ” ; The Kanaka-labor advocate
says the white can’t cut cane in Mackay (N.Q.)
district, owing to the climate. Well, cane-cutting
is now in full swing, and a better climate it would
be hard to find this time of year. A sugaroo,
t’other day, told me that he had never employed
a nig. on nis farm. He had only 20 acres of cane
under cultivation, giving 20 tons per acre. This,
sold at 12s. per ton, gives the respectable yearly
return of £240. Of course, he and his family did
all the work. But, if you do away with the
Kanaka in this district, you have the Chow, Jap,
and Hindu to contend with. This year, most of
the cutting has been done by contract by these
races.

“ Alone ” : Have waited patiently for some
of the hundreds of bushmen who have put a boil-
ing billy on the palm of the hand to
set The Bulletin right on the point.
That well-intentioned advice, “Picric
acid is good for the resultant burns,” is
prompted by a misapprehension, for
there would be no resultant burns. If
the quart-pot is boiling on the coals,
with the lid off, anybody may safely
grip it with the ends of the fingers
of one hand (taking care that the
fingers only touch it below the water-
level), and place it on the palm of
the other hand —no hurry necessary,
for no uncomfortable heat will be felt.
The thing has some small scientific
interest, and would be as well eluci-
dated. Have not had a chance
lately to try the experiment with the
lid of billy on, but, by theory, believe
The Bulletin’s recommendation to
have the picric acid ready would be
good then. With the lid off, I have
seen the boiling billy on a dozen
hands besides my own, and it is
astonishing how long it takes the heat to begin
radiating outwards unpleasantly.

“The joke I>f the Seddon speech about
letting loose 5000 Maoris on the Boers,” said a
Maorilander tq The Bulletin the other day,
“is that it would be the Boers who would,
metaphorically of course, eat up the Maoris.. The
dusky tattoed gentleman took some blood in the
old days : now he’s only got about enough energy
to take a warm bath. Even at his best the Maori
couldn’t compare with the Boer as a fighter, else
he would never have been worsted by a tiny force
of whites. Nowadays the Maori is an utter
degenerate, who can kill * with his mouth,’ but
never could get a spry enemy to his teeth. If
5000 Maoris went to S’Africa, a commando of
500 Boers would be able to chase them from
Mafeking to Ladysmith.”
The S’African meat-contractors, who made
a million or two at selling meat to the British
troops at lOd. to lid. per lb. for the first year of
the war, and who now have the contract at 7d.
per lb., are practically all Jews —and mostly
foreign Jews. Here are their names: Morris
Bergl (foreign Jew), Samuel Weil (f.J.), David
Harris (Jew), Carl Meyer (f. J.), Carl Hanan (f. J.),
John Stroyan, Benjamin Weil (f.J.), Isaac Lewis
(Jew), Agar Beit (f.J.), and Solomon Joel (f.J.)
Truly this is the war of the Chosen People, on the
Boer’s country and the Englishman’s purse.
This, from a Maorilander in S’Africa, lets
the cat out of the bag a little:—
Many people wonder that so many are in arms against
us, notwithstanding the subtractions which our reports
account for. An explanation may be found in the
exigencies of service. If an officer loses men there will
be a mark against him, unless he can. show that he
inflicted a heavier loss on the enemy. This is not a work
of insuperable difficulty. There will be a check in the
number captured, but who is to say how many were
killed ? They are not supposed to return a list of men
killed unless the bodies have been counted ; but it is
possible to make mistakes. The Oommander-in-Ohief js
not likely to send an inspector to verify the report; so it
generally comes about that we inflict greater loss than
we sustain ourselves.

From an English paper, a 20 years’ old
copy:
To Mr. Chamberlain the Tory party is the fiend incar-
nate, the embodiment of evil, the source of all the ills
that afflict humanity. It is the Tories who are responsible
for cholera in Egypt, for the high price of champagne, for
the slackness of the coal trade, and above all for the
roughness of the English Channel. It is the Tories, too,
who have filled Ireland with anarchy and misery, and
altogether it would be well to sweep such villains from the
face of the earth.

The Federal Government has a poor sense
of its dignity in refusing to pay water-rates on its
offices in Sydney. The Cabinet shouldn’t allow
personal idiosyncrasies to dictate its political
actions.
The Weary Trenwith has the pluck to tell
a few wholesome truths on occasion. A Toora
(Gippsland) deputation caught him en route
t’other day and casually asked for a new road
from Smith’s paddock to the Back of Beyond.
“ Make your own roads,” replied Minister Tren-
with; “pay your rates; and, if they are not
enough, rate higher.”
The Peacock Ministry threatens to beat
the record of J. B. Patterson’s Government as a
“ picnic party.” The other day Lands Minister
Duggan “ inspected ” the Fumina district, accom-
panied by over 100 people, with cooks and camp-
followers and grub galore. A file of Melbourne
artillerymen went ahead to plant tents and pre-
pare the way, and the party, taking a point from,
the Johnnie officers suffering at the front, carried
its cooking-stoves and musical instruments along.
The little outing cost about £450.

PHOSFERINE
The Greatest of all Tonics.
Phosferine is the most powerful Nerve and Recuperative
Tonic known. It removes Mental Depression, want of Tone and
Nerve Power. It has remarkable Health-giving, Strength-giving,
Energising, and Rejuvenating properties.
No other Medicine has received such absolute proof of its
extraordinary properties in restoring Shattered Constitutions, and
in giving back to the prematurely aged New Life and Energy.
It is an unfailing remedy for Neuralgia, Nervous Dys-
pepsia, Anaemia, Brain-Fag, Depression, Impoverished Blood,
Rheumatism, Sleeplessness, Indigestion, Influenza, Nervous
Headaches, Debility, and all disorders consequent upon a
reduced state of the nervous system.
ROYAL COMMANDS.
Phosferine enjoys the distinguished honour of having been supplied by commands to
MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY.

HIS RUPTURE
CURED.
Engineer on the Midland Railway
Restored by the Wonderful Rice
Method.
One of the well-known engineers on the Midland
Railway, having been in their employ a long time,
relates some very interesting facts about how he
cured himself of a bad rupture by the Rice
Method. His name is George Jordan, and is in
good standing, so what he says for the benefit of
other railway men who are ruptured can be relied
upon as truthful and of value.
27, Bishopstone Road, Gloucester,
Dr. W. S. Rice. July 2i; iOJI. ■
Dear Sir,—l am very pleased to say that I am
cured of Rupture after using your treatment for
three months, having been ruptured for seventeen
ye i have already spent a lot of money on treatment,
having paid one doctor sixteen guineas without
getting much good, and I had lost all hope of being
cured until I read your advertisement in Lloyds
acted strictly on your advice, and I have not been
troubled with my Rupture since the first week I tried
your treatment, and although I get a lot of shaking
about (being a locomotive engine driver on the
Midland Railway), I have not worn a Truss for about
two months, and I do not feel the slightest weakness
now, and am enjoying better health than I have
had for seventeen years.
You can make what use you like of this letter, as
I am anxious for all sufferers to know of your treat-
ment; and I shall advise all my friends afflicted with
this complaint to use it, as I know it will cure per-
manently.—Your faithfully, George Jordan.
The RICE Method of curing rupture is as near
perfect as anything could be, and a great many
remarkable cures have been effected. Every
ruptured railway man should write Dr. W. S. Rice,
9D stonecutter Street, LONDON, E.C., who
will send a FREE SAMPLE of his method also
a complete and illustrated series of pamphlets
showing conclusively that his method cannot fail ot
a cure. It is a home treatment at small cost, with-
out pain, danger, operation, or an hours detention
from work. Do not fail to write for either yourself
or someone you know to he ruptured.
“A dame of the Western district, where they
all keep dozens of servants, don’t you know,
recently scored one for her side by showing the
hollowness of the old proverb, ‘ When the cat's
away the mice will play.’ She was lying upstairs
ill in bed, in fact her baby was but a day old,
when, her nurse being somewhere out of the
way, she heard some unusually lively playing
up downstairs. Being a person of great strength
of will, she got up, and, suddenly appearing in the
midst of the amazed staff, sacked six servants on
the spot. Of course, it nearly killed her, but
imagine her feeling of victory as she crept under-
neath the blankets again !
“Lately one of the fashionable votaries of one
of our small creeds introduced a daughter into
the world by means of nothing more potent, than
her own sublime faith. Her fellow-believers
tell the story proudly. She had a bath at
8 o’clock, and the child was ushered into the
world an hour later ;no nurses, no doctors. The
new arrival is a lusty infant, and the mother (one
of Toorak’s wealthiest) was not in the least per-
turbed at the event. This sort of thing happens
not infrequently in Scotch Presbyterian circles in
the Highlands, but the Presbyterians, never
thought of advertising their religion on the
strength of it as an easy one to be born in.
“It has been hinted many times within the last
six weeks that now was the chance for a woman
doctor to make the Women’s Hospital catmittee
sit up and accept one of its own for-many-years-
rejected sex as resident. But the girl doctor wasn’t
taking any. Now comes alo ig Dr. Margaret
Whyte Martell, who has bfeen married and out of
the running these half-dozen years, and to
whom a professional boycott signifies as much
or as little as to hoary and pensioned Dr.
Shields. She’s smart enough,' though. A great
surgeon said of her when she graduated
that not only was she the cleverest sur-
gical student of her years, but the cleverest
for many years. She is a daughter of old Pat
Whyte, who started the Model School in Spring-
street in the fifties, and she has a number of bright
and brainy sisters.
“Macedon residents, or most of them, feel
happier than they have done since ‘ dear Lady
Loch’ left Victoria. The Hopetouns, from the
first, neglected Govt, cottage at Macedon, and
favored firstly, Camperdown, secondly, the most
remote station they could get at Ararat. The
Brasseys spent their holidays falling from the
masthead of their yacht on the high seas, or
tumbling off bikes in Raspberry-land. State-
Governor Clarke and family have fallen in love
with the Macedon place, and, better still, want to
be friendly with their holiday neighbors, and are
making it known that they wish them to call.
“ A popular comedian and a captivating mate
caused a flutter in a Bourke-st. chiffon establish-
ment, the other day. The comedian was delving
deep into his sovereign-case at every counter
at which they anchored. At last he reached the
limit of his purse, or his patience, and was leaving
shopland for ever. But the sprightly siren in
his charge led him on to further destruction
—he had to part with more of his good
earnings at the fur department, where the
saucy one had set covetous eyes and hands
on a muff. He sought then to fly from
the place. But that jolly comedian was
dragged further on his affliction pilgrimage, and
found his final punishment at a port-of-call in the
millinery launching-place where he had to see
several hats on a pretty head ere he was
released from his arduous duties. It was the
best day’s entertainment that the shop-employees
had ever enjoyed—a kind of impromptu matinee.
“ A house-agent tells this tale. A plump, good-
humored Irish matron entered his office, house-
hunting. ‘ Have you any family, madam ? ’ in-
quired agent, putting the usual question, as some
house-owners object to tenants with children
(possibly destructive). ‘Oh, none to spake of,’
the lady replied airily, ‘ only nine little bhoys.’
That’s the spirit for a new country ! No talk of
falling birth-rate if all women took their responsi-
bilities thus gaily.
“ According to one of them, who gravely writes
to inform me, the domestic servants of Toorak are
getting up a petition to His Majesty the King,
numbly praying him to set his face against Sunday
labor. ‘Some time ago,’ writes my correspon-
dent, the cable stated ‘the King gave a dinner-
party on Sunday.’ Gov.-Gen. Hopetoun followed
suit in Cup week with a dinner-party. Then a
heathen woman in Toorak said she would go one
better, and gave the largest ‘ At Home ’ ever seen
in the State on a Sunday. The outcome of this
is that Sunday has become the great visiting day
in Toorak, and some 2000 of us are kept at work
all the seven days round, for your genuine
Toorakienne pays no more attention to the
Sabbath than does a crow.’ I shall be glad to
hear King Tummy’s reply to the petition.
“Melbourne clubs and Toorak boudoirs are
busy speculating on the chances of the best-looking
‘killer’ of smart sassiety capturing the very
wealthy widow whom he is plying with attentions.
What a catch it would be for him, after all these
years philandering and waiting ! There is actually
betting over it in a plutocratic club.
“ Our Rotten Row, alias Alexandra-avenue, re-
mains almost neglected of our Naicest, who keep
away from Yarra’s banks in great crowds. The
river’s associations with red-flag spouters, also its
fearsome smells and frequent dead babies, seem to
kill all toney aspirations. One personage to
use it is our No. 1 Topside Governor, who
comes down from his big house on the hill and

“Lady Braddon is making herself a factor in
our Women’s Edification circles. Whatever has
for its object the advancement of Women’s Morals
or Manners has the Tasmanienne’s support. Yet
she is a shy, timid speaker, nervous at giving forth
her opinions, and always wearing her bonnet-

curl.

smart sisters flourished the Romney ringlet over
the left shoulder, with pink and red rose respec-
tively resting. at the root of the curl. It has

Dear Sir. —I am writing to acknowledge the receipt, in good order and condition, of the “ Gil-Gai.” It is just exactly what I required: runs beautifully,
is wonderfully light and very strong, and is much admired by all who have seen it, and I feel confident that you will have other orders for both the Single and
Double-seated “ Gil-Gai” from this district.—l am, faithfully yours, F. G. Champion.
POLITICAL
POINTS
A section of the farmers in Port Douglas
district, representing about 20,000 tons of cane,
are paying white men £1 per acre for trashing
cane, and getting plenty of them at the price.
Truly they are the Englishmen of Asia,
these Japanese. Their latest proposal is to adopt
Christianity as a nation, “ as likely to be advan-
tageous in political negotiations with the West.”
State aid to religion in N.S.W. in 1901 :
C.E., £2141; R.C., £1100; Presbyterian, £552
and Wesleyan, £450. These are the remnants
from the days when the clergy were a sort of State
civil service.
S. M. Herald does not hold freetrade
bigotedly. Discussing the new British Budget in
which a penny additional is put upon income and
3d. or sd. on breadstuffs, it hails with satisfaction
the assurance that the income-tax will be the first
reduced.
Governors Lawley (W.A.), Clarke (Vic.)
and Tennyson (S.A.) foregathering in Adelaide
the other day, take the first step in a contemplated
new practice. It is being arranged that the State
Governors shall periodically confer, with the
Govemor-Genasal in the chair, in -one capital or
another.
Soutl* Australia has made a political record
—it is the first Australian State to effect a
simultaneous dissolution of Council and Assembly.
All the members of both Houses are to be elected
on Saturday, May 3, and as that is a big race-day,
the Labor party is very anxious concerning the
result, especially as its
followers are showing
extreme apathy. Two
of their meetings in
Adelaide fell through
for l ick of attendance,
more Labor candidates
and reporters being
present at each than
there were voters to listen*
WITH AN EYE TO THEIR
REDEMPTION.
SALVARMY CONVERT ( testifying): “Dear brothers,
thank ’Eaven I'm a sinner no longer. I've
been in gaol for burglary, but now, praise
the Lord, I've left my evil ways and my
tools, and ”
VOICE FROM THE CROWD (anxiously): “ Where
'ave you left the tools, ole man? ”
The last scraps of the White Australia
policy are vanishing. Mr. Barton has now
allowed the pearl-shelling industry of Burns,
Philp & Co. a three-months’ exemption from the
provisions of all anti-colored labor - legislation !
When the three months’ exemption has expired,
Parliament will be out of session, and the Prime
Minister out of the country, so an extension of
the exemption will be a matter of , course.
B. R. Wise’s eulogy of the “ great Eng-
lishman ” (Seddon), at Saturday’s banquet in the
Hotel Australia, Sydney, was, in the principles
it laid down, as nearly as possible the direct con-
tradiction of the anti-Soudan war opinions he
held while under the tutelage of the late Parkes.
Cabled that “ the notorious ” Kruitzinger,
the valiant Boer raider, has been acquitted through
an “intercepted letter showing that the prisoner
reproached Scheepers for burning houses and
otherwise expressed humane and honorable senti-
ments.” So it isn’t “ humane and honorable ” (for
a Boer) to burn houses !
The Victorian Employers’ Federation
tacks this motto to its manifesto : “ Men are the
best judges of their own interests.” And yet the
V.E.F.’s policy is mainly to squelch factory-legis-
lation. “ Men are the best judges of their own
interests ” is an excellent motto for a Society of
Anarchists if looked at in the V.E.F.’s light.
Regarded in another way it is an excellent excuse
for the Vic. Factories Act.
The only clear course for the Federal
Government to follow in re the 57th clause of the
Postal Act is to suppress all gambling practices
making use of post-offices, or to introduce a new
definition discriminating between what it regards
as noxious lotteries and innocent ones, or between
those the profits of which go to individuals, and
those the profits of whioh are devoted to public
purposes, such as charities.
There are vacancies for five members in
Torrens (Adelaide suburban) electorate, and among
the candidates are two Liberals, three Labor, and
two Ass. candidates. The result is very open, and
there is much betting as to whether Opposition-
leader Darling, Premier Jenkins, or Laborite
Coneybeer will head the poll, a feat which will
need at least 9000 votes. Labor-leader Price is
also a candidate, but he will probably get fourth
or fifth place.
The acceptance of an office of profit under
the Crown by a member of the Leg. Assembly
should be promptly followed by the member’s
resignation of his seat. The growing tendency in
N.S.W. is to stick to the seat until the new duties
actually begin. The Speaker has a certain discre-
tion in issuing the writ for election, especially if
the House be in recess, and he seems to drop into
the same view as the member. But a member’s
influence as a member should cease as soon as he
formally accepts a paid billet.
When Victoria decided to abolish poli-
tical influence by making employment in
the civil service dependent on competi-
tive examination instead of on the
possession of an uncle in Parlia-
ment, it made one ghastly mis-
take. “Temporary
employees ” may be
taken on without
passing the neces-
sary examina-
tion ; may re-
main on any
time, get any
salary, and fill
almost any kind
of billet. Parlia-
ment intended,
in its burst of
honest indigna-
tion, merely to
provide that in
any department
an odd-job man
might be em-
ployed for a
few days or
weeks, but it
forgot. In
several depart-
ments the
“temporary ”
staff exceeds
the permanent
staff now, is
better paid,
has been
longerin office,
and pretty
nearly all of it
has an uncle
in Parliament,
or some other
greasy person
breathing in the
large, flushed ear of
authority.
Thus “Kiwi ” from M.L. :
I am a republican out-and-out. But republicanism is
too good a thing to be spoilt by a rabble unworthy of
better things than they have got. The people haven’t as
yet shown themselves worthy of anything better than
pale, attenuated monarchy. Imagine a republic in
England just now 1 Joe Chamberlain would be President,
and the great helpless crowd would be no better off. Or
suppose a republic in Australia. Barton or Reid would
be President 1 A republic in Maoriland would mean
Seddon as President, a calamity which I shudder to think
of. Give me poor, spindle-legged, aimless, dawdling,
good-hearted Ranfurly and “ our glorious Constitution ”
any day before such a republic.
Surely Federal Labor-leader Watson must
be backsliding. David Syme’s illustrated weekly
gave him a page portrait last week, and the
accompanying letter-press was mainly butter
about his “ moderation,” etc. Next day G. H.
Reid, in the House of Reps, eye-glassed Watson
and said more nice things about his fairness and
the assistance he had given to the Freetrade party.
Watson has had a pretty rough time of it this
session. His party is about as united as a bag of
Kilkenny cats on the fiscal and many other
questions.
The Peacock Government’s existence
appears to be a continuous struggle to find a new
excuse for diddling a few more wrecks out
of their old-age pensions, and its success in
this respect is fiendish. The natural
tendency of an old-age-pension system
is for the payments to steadily increase
with the growth of population, but
in Victoria the bill grows smaller at
each fortnightly pay. On the last
eight pay-days the amounts paid
were respectively £10,854, £10,769,
£10,694, £10,558, £10,384, £10,223,
£9931, £9778. Since January, 1872 pen-
sioners have been got rid of. Of these
580 are “suspended” and 1292 are
cancelled. Of the 1292, eight were
proved to have acquired their pen-
sions without being entitled to
them, nine were ejected for drunk-
enness, 107 are now supported by
their children, and a few more
were cut off for tangible reasons,
good or bad, but as regards the
great majority (1059) the report
simply sets forth that their pen-
sions were stopped—apparently
for no reason except to save money.
It comes so near to being mean, dirty
spieling and sneak-thievery that it
is hardly worth while to call it any-
thing else.
This, from the correspondent of
a leading M.L. paper, shows that Jingo loyal
grief at ’Ome is just as insincere and short-
lived as it is here :
The great national memorial to the late Queen hangs
fire hopelessly as ever. Not half the sum needed for the
execution of the design adopted is forthcoming, and
there is no likelihood of any substantial accretion to the
amount subscribed at the outset. The whole affair has
proved a fiasco, and it is most deplorable that, such a
slight should be cast on the memory of our greatest
Sovereign. The only chance appears to be that Parlia-
ment may vote the balance. But that would in itself be
a publication of discreditable failure.
It is cabled that the British Government
calculates on screwing a revenue of £5,000,000 or
more out of the desolated Transvaal during the
coming year. And when the Kruger Government
collected £4,800,000 (it only reached that amount
during one year) by means of a tariff not quite
half as heavy as Tasmania’s —this when the
country was at the height of its prosperity !—the
howl about “iniquitous taxation” disturbed the
globe in its sleep.
Every other male and four out of every
five females have no vote for 9. A. Leg.
Council, though the popular Tory gag is that
there is “practically adult suffrage” for both
State Houses, as there certainly is for both
Federal Houses. The actual figures are: —
Assembly, 76,767 males and 71,682 females ; Coun-
cil, 38,458 males and 13,463 females. There are
6873 fewer males on the Assembly rolls than there
were three years ago.
In the last ten years the six Common-
wealth States have only gained 8335 people by
immigration. This, combined with the diminished
birth-rate, isn’t calculated to realise O’Sullivan’s
wild and whirling vision about a population of
60,000,000 half-a-century hence. Over 3000 of the
immigrants, too, had their passages paid by the
State, and the rest were niggers. N. S. Wales’s
share of the immigrants was 864—and it was the
third best State on the list.
It is pretty evident that the Jenkins taxa-
tion schemes, if agreed to at all, will be consider-
ably modified by the new S. A. Parliament. City
candidates condemn the suggested reduction of
the income-tax exemption to £lOO, and think £l5O
low enough. Country candidates howl against the
land-tax, and the shoppy community protests
that the extra stamp-taxes will “dislocate” busi-
ness. All unite in crying for economy, and are
solid in their objection to any retrenchment which
affects themselves or their constituents.
Hardly any of the S.A. general election
candidates in and around Adelaide have had
decently-attended meetings, Premier Jenkins and
Opposition-Leader Darling excepted. The Labor-
ites, in particular, have given their men scant
encouragement. When 8 p.m. came there were
four candidates, four reporters and four electors
at the Laborites Town Hall meeting ! And two
of the best-known and straightest Labor men—one
an old Parliamentarian—could not get a meeting
at all at their chief centre, North Adelaide.
Premier Seddon, in the course of a recent
lengthy speech at Wellington (M.L.), read an
enormously long letter cursing the Boers which he
had written to the Governor; also, a rather per-
functory epistle from Lord Roberts in answer to
a letter which Seddon had sent him advising him
how to govern the conquered territories. Poor
old Dick does these things quite seriously, too.
His sense of humor has departed with his increas-
ing waistcoat, and he is capable now of
expostulating with the archangel Gabriel about
the inefficient way he blows his trumpet.
Australia is really in a tight place for food,
and may have to import. Despite the great falling
off in the area under cultivation the harvest was
more than enough for the country’s requirements,
but reckless exporting before the situation was
fully understood reduced the stock. Having sent
a lot of wheat to the other end of the world and
sold it cheap, it may yet be necessary to buy the
same or similar wheat dear and drag it back again.
Still the process increases the exports and imports,
and a large class of people measures the country’s
prosperity solely by its exports and imports.
Mr. Seddon, The Bulletin is glad to see,
has the decency to be ashamed of the disgracefully
savage speech recently attributed to him by the
Australian and the Maoriland papers. He says
TOO TRUTHFUL.
MR. BEOWN: “My dear, I have always told you
everything
MRS. B.: “ Yes! that is why I always suspect
you.”
now that it was not he who was so infamously
blood-thirsty as to suggest letting loose cannibal
Maoris on the Boers, but that all the reporters
were so misguided as to put words “ spoken by a
Maori chief, and used metaphorically years ago,”
into his mouth. It is a highly convincing explana-
tion ; but is welcome as showing that, in cold
bUjd, Mr. Seddon does not favor savage massacre.
Senator Henry Dobson, of Tasmania,
writes to the press, saying that he sees “no
objection to Tasmania accepting a loan from the
Federal Government of £lOO,OOO a year without
interest” to keep the island’s finances afloat.
Tasmania sent a considerable body of Freetraders
and low-tariffists to the House of Reps., and their
clamor for low duties helped to leave Tasmania,
Queensland and S.A. in a very bad hole. And'
Dobson sees no reason why Tasmania should not
accept, partly at the expense of these other dis-
tressed States, a loan of £lOO,OOO a year with no
interest and not too good security ! This is really
kind of Dobson.
The cry which really carrred Snow’s
Adelaide Tramway grab through S.A. Parlia-
ment was that the Snow push would set to work
immediately the Bill was passed, and would
thereby supply work for the unemployed during
the coming winter. Everybody who objected was
denounced as an enemy who desired to prevent the
unemployed getting work during the coming
winter. Everybody who doubted was asked what
better scheme he could devise to help the unem-
ployed through the coming winter. Now the Bill
is passed, and nothing is done. Snow is off to
London on various financial missions, and nobody
connected with his scheme seems to care a rap
whether the unemployed starve next winter, and
the winter after that, or not. And the syndicators,
who were damp with tears (till the Bill passed)
over the woes of the unemployed next winter,
are quite dry now.
Before leaving for the Coronation, Premier
Seddon girded uji his bingey and went north and
spake unto his children, the Maoris. He told
them that he intended to establish mounted,
volunteer corps of Maoris all over the island;,
under their own chiefs, trained at Government-
expense, as British officers. The officers would be
elected, and in six months time Seddon hopes to
have 5000 of these new soldiers of the King under
arms. In the event of the white forces being
drafted away for the defence of Kidderminster or
other portions of the Empire, the task of defend-
ing Maoriland would devolve on the Maoris. The
announcement was received with wild cheers; and
Bun Tuck, like a thoughtful mob orator, sat down
to refreshments without making any unpleasant
remarks as to the cost of all these elaborate ideas.
Anyhow, what sort of a place would Maoriland be
to live in if all the able-bodied fighting whites
were withdrawn, and the women and children left
under the care of the Maoris ? Also, when these
mounted Maori corps are formed, Premier Seddon
will find a lot more difficulty in collecting the dog-
tax ; and when the white troops are away storm-
ing Moscow, or driving the Mexican mounted
fleet off the summit of Popocatelpetl, he won’t be
able to collect the dog-tax at all.
If Premier Seddon contrives to build up
his preferential British tariff, and foreign States
retaliate against Maoriland produce, that province
will probably get a violent surprise. Maoriland,
on paper, sells almost everything to England, and
has no need to consider other countries. But it
only does that because it has no lines of steamers
going directly to France, Germany, Italy, &c.
all the supplies that these countries take from
Maoriland go via England, and rank as English
imports. If Maoriland provokes them to dis-
criminate against its goods, it will then find out
for the first time how much it depends on them.
At one time N.S.W. also imagined that
Britain took practically all its exports. Then
French and German steamship lines came to
Sydney, and the goods which France and Ger-
many used to buy through England began to go
direct to those countries, and N.S.W. discovered,
with a shock, that England takes less than half
its goods, and even of that half a great deal is for
foreign countries which have no direct steam
communication with Sydney. The solemn fact
seems to be that England takes, on its own
account, about a fourth of our exports, and the
preferential tariff idea is really a proposal that the
people who take the other three-fourths shall be
deliberately incited to boycott us. That will be
bad for us. It will also be bad for England, which
still makes a handsome profit out of the carriage
of much of the produce which foreign countries
buy from us, to say nothing of what it makes in
the way of middleman’s commission also.


TONE QUALITY
of a distinct individuality is the
first essential you look for m a
High-grade Piano. Our experience
of nearly half a century has been an
education to us j we have been
enabled to discriminate between
harsh, discordant noise and pure
tone quality, such as is preferred
by true music-lovers.
You will find in Paling’s Pianos
just the quality of tone you wish
for. Good tone quality means the
best workmanship, otherwise the
result could not be attained.
Good workmanship and good
material are bound to produce
durability, not the least important
factor in a good-grade piano.
STEINWAY PIANOS
are the highest grade we can im-
Eort— dearer than all the others—
ut then THEY ARE BEST.
If too high in price, we have
other makes to choose from.
BRINSMEAD PIANOS
are the best instrum ints of English
manufacture, and the prices will
suit most buyers.
LIPP PIANOS
are always great favorites with the
Australian public—grand quality
at a nominal cost.

To Mr. W. WEBBER, Proprietor
VITADATIO
Launceston, Tasmania.
Dear Sir, —When your agent arrived at Melbourne, and
claimed to be able to do much good with your VITADATIO
for all who suffer, I really thought he was an impostor.
Previous to his arrival I heard of VITADATIO, so I wrote
to my friends (in fact, my brother and his family) at
Launceston, Tasmania, to know if Mr. Palmer is the
authorised agent, and received a favorable reply. As I
had been ailing for some years with pains in my back,
which doubtless took its rise from a disordered state of
the liver and kidneys, as well as a periodical attack of
pains about the breast, and extending to the shoulder,
the two latter I was told by one doctor was “ Dry
Pleuritis ” (or pleurisy), and after years of suffering and
“treatment,” and no good results, I gave your VITA-
DATIO a trial, and have taken in all half-a-dozen large
bottles. It gives me pleasure to inform you I am quite
released from my complaint, and heartily recommend
the use of VITADATIO to any who may require a reliable
medicine. I have no objection to your publishing this
note.— Yours truly,
a GRIFFITHS.

O’Sullivan’s Dream—O’Sullivan’s Polly.
When the State of N.S.W. resumed the Rocks
area of Sydney city it found itself landlord of
some of the most insanitary dog-holes that ever
disgraced a white man’s city. In fact, the
resumption was brought about by the smellful
failure of private landlordism to keep the locality
habitable, when its appalling filthiness came to
light through the plague outbreak, and the smell-
ful failure of the municipal authorities to make
private landlordism any cleaner. So unspeakable
was the state of the whole district that it was
recognised that improvement was impossible ; the
only remedy was complete demolition and rebuild-
ing. _ So the State Govt, resumed it, and is now
considering how to improve it and make the im-
provement pay.
* * * *
Had the O’Seeullivan Govt, paid for the
resumption out of revenue it could have dotted
the whole area over with workmen’s cottages—
roomy, airy, and well apart—and made a hand-
some profit out of the transaction. But it didn’t.
As usual, it paid, or will pay, for all the land out
of loans ; and it will compensate the owners of
the demolished buildings out of loans also ; and
the interest that has accumulated on the compen-
sation money will be paid out of loans ; and
the new structures which replace the demolished
dens, will be paid for out of more loans, and all the
repairs, and the annual paintings and other
expenses will also be defrayed out of loans ; and
the comfort and polish of the district will be
fretted away by five great masses of grinding
interest.
» • * •
Living in the Rocks area are between three
and four thousand people who depend for
an existence on coal-lumping and general
wharf work. They must live in that neigh-
borhood, because their breadwinners must be
near to their work, as they are called up
at all sorts of unseasonable times, and often have
long waits, owing to the uncertainty of the time
of arrival of steamers. Had the O’Seeullivan
Govt, built proper cottage-homes, it would have
: a 1 assured constant tenants. But, owing to
the shiftless, crude manipulation of the financial
part of the business, the ground must be made to
yield a very large revenue and cannot be spared
for workmen’s homes. Therefore the O’Seeullivan
will economise the space for dwelling purposes
and devote the greater portion of the property to
more “profitable” uses. The workers, whose
dens (they cannot be called homes) are about to be
demolished, are to be housed in two huge terrace
structures, at a cost of £190,000. The buildings
are to be five storeys high, built round a court-
yard, “ replete with every modern convenience,
and with the acme of privacy possible in a tene-
ment terrace.”
• * * *
There are several designs, but the best put for-
ward appears to be that of architect Varney
Parkes. If the Govt, adopts the Parkes design,
it will be making the best of a very bad
business. Mr. Parkes’ design provides for a
gigantic skeleton of steel, veneered with glazed
terra-cotta, and faced on the outside with stone.
From turret to foundation there will be nothing
to burn except the furniture, and a general con-
flagration will be impossible. At the corners of
the colossal pile will stand great towers of stone,
the alternate ones containing steel staircases, 15ft.
wide, opening on to the public corridors of every
floor. The public corridors will be merely elevated
sidewalks, running along the front of the structure.
Inside will be miniature gardens protected with
neat iron railings. Behind the gardens will be
the verandahs, and each occupier may have
a six, four, or two-roomed house, whichever
he chooses. It is not expected that the stairs
will be used very much, as the building will be
plentifully provided with lifts. The great virtue
of the Parkes design is that each dwelling has its
own yard, bath-room, and outhouses, also its gas
cooker. Even the little one-room-bed-sitting
apartment has its own bath cabinet. The six,
four, and two-roomed houses are to be let
at 12s. 6d., 10s. 6d. and 7s. 6d. a week respec-
tively. The single rooms with their batb cabinets,
for single men and women, will be in another
building, will have no kitchens or yards, and
they will be let for 3s. 6d. per week.
* » * •
In the great basement will be swimming baths,
a co-operative kitchen, co-operative laundries,
libraries and billiard-rooms. The arrangement
for the removal of refuse is elaborate. Along the
back of each tenement will run a tiny electric
railway, along which will travel at regular inter-
vals rubbish-tumbrils, into which the housewife
can deposit her refuse as it passes. The tumbrils
will automatically discharge their cargo into a
collector, whence it will be removed in the ordi-
nary way. 4
• * • *
So much for the O’Sullivan dream —which
seems to need only one or two improve-
ments to make it perfect. In the centre
of the building there should be a patent
cellular contrivance for burning tobaccoes, and
the tenements should all be connected with
the contrivance by tubes, which could be switched
on at will to the particular cell in which a certain
kind of tobacco is being consumed. A small
indicator-board on the verandah would show from
which tube the thrifty wharf lumper could draw
choice Havanna and the spendthrift puff the
smoke of the local-made plug. Also, by a
penny-in-the-slot contrivance the building might
arrange for a convenient supply of liquor ; the
machine would shoot mixed drinks direct
into the mouth of coalheaver O’Dooley without
giving him the trouble of draining a glass. Prob-
ably as soon as his attention is called to these
matters, Mr. O’Sullivan will provide for them in
the specifications.
* * * *
It is the dream of The O’Sullivan to build a
vast pile that, pyramid-like, will go down solidly
through the crumbling ages as an eternal monu-
ment to O’Sullivan —a people’s palace, on the
verandahs of which the gentle ’longshoreman will
spend his hours of ease in a deck-chair puffing at
the smokeometer and reading the latest maga-
zines, while his wife waters the liliputian garden,
and his daughter inside plays an exquisite little
gem of her own setting on the piano.
* • • *
In reality the building, if ever erected, will
most probably be known as O’Sullivan’s Jug. The
empty garden spaces will be filled with empty
jam-tins (the kids always sell the beer-bottles to
the bottle-O’ man) over which Dooley and Doolan
will roll in a ferocious embrace to decide what
really was trumps. The small boys will take ex-
cursions on the rubbish tumbrils with results that
will swell Coghlan’s juvenile-mortality statistics.
The rubbish-service will be disorganised by the
kids playing Britons and Boers, and the de-railing
of British armored trains. Then passengers in the
lifts will be annoyed by sudden deluges of slops and
showers of fish-heads being flung down the lift-
well because that British armored train is off the
line. The place will smell sweet and fresh till
the more enterprising individualists commence
keeping pigs and fowls in the glazed back-yards ;
and as the paint wears off, and the lumpers strike
matches on the glazed terracotta, the establish-
ment will assume a frowsy appearance, which will
grow gradually worse while the Govt, is trying to
float a loan in London with which to fix the place
up. For the people who are to see that this place
is kept clean and healthy are just the same shift-
less crowd that has never yet kept anything clean
and healthy in Sydney. And even the Hanging
Gardens of Babylon would become an unclean
disgrace without proper supervision.
* * « •
But the chief end will be served. The lumpers
will have got a sort of a shelter, and O’Sullivan

Happenings at Canterbury Park (Sydney) R.C.
meet on Saturday were such as to make the hair of the
toughest turf parasite stand on end. Race after race saw
a big array of non-triers line up, and some of them, to
avoid winning, had to do glaring things that fairly para-
lysed hoary-headed old professional punters and made
even Mo. redden to his ear tips, Still, they were not strong
enough to attract official notice. Instances occurred of
the public rushing and backing nags down to 2 to 1, and,
though heaps of coin found its way into Mo.’s satchels, he
was yelping tens at flag fall. Some of those responsible
for the stiffest of this great foregathering of stiff ’uns
were not ordinary racecourse “ guns,” trainers, jockeys or
the like, but alleged reputable people. Maoriland lepper
Regalia 11. was served up scorchingly hot for the Jumpers’
Flat race and duly won, but not till the throng who laid
the odds had a bad scare, through which, till near the
end, it looked like a possible runaway win by oberon
(30 to 1). Way the coin came labelled Burraneer “ sure ”
for the Canterbury Handicap, and the report he had
romped over Royal Purple in a trial made the nag look
the good thing, but he shaped like a cart horse. Outsider
Pegasus (12 to 1) won, with first favorite (Horace) second,
and well backed Bira third.
* * * •
Told that immediately after the old top-notch
lepper Chelsea had blundered at the stone wall in
Onkaparinga steeplechase and was shot through having
broken his leg, a ghoulish horde of human vultures
rushed the animal and even while life yet remained
knifed off the lower portions of his fore and hind legs
and literally slashed him to pieces in quest of mementoes
from the hide, mane, tail, and jaw. He should never
have been sent for the event seeing that he had to hump
13st. and was anything but steady on his pins.

Crack three-year colt Grasspan has been sold to
go to S’Africa. Figure paid probably exceeds 600g5., as
the prad was passed-in at latest Randwick sales when
bidding stuck at 550 gs. Grasspan annexed last V.R.C.
St. Leger, and, ’tis insisted by those who should know
most about him, that but for bad luck both V.R.C. and
A.J.C. Derbies would have been his. He is brother to
Brakpan (the season’s crack 2-year-old), by Grafton from
Piecrust, by Martini-Henry. At different times, V. A.T.C.
Mona Nursery, A.J.C. Easter Stakes, Rosehill Hopetoun
Stakes, A.J.C. New Stakes, and Duff Memorial Stakes
were won by him.
• * *
Turf axiom, “Horses for courses,” has rarely
been more forcibly exemplified than in the case of
Niagara-Welcome 6yr.-old gelding Canadian, which ap-
propriated Shorts Handicap at Canterbury (Sydney),
Saturday last. This nag, though figuring in races for
years, hasn’t been successful anywhere but at Canter-
bury. His first triumph was in a Park Stakes, then he
closed on a double in one afternoon (the Flying and
Shorts Handicaps), and next came latest cop. Each time
he has been backed with heaps of spirit and loads of coin,
and won easily on every occasion.
* * * *
Epsom (Vic.) latest meet produced something
unusual. Austerlitz and Altairs “ weighed"" out ” for
Jumpers’ Flat Race, but reached the post too late to take
part. Respective trainers were fined £lO each—the
maximum. Both nags were in the betting—Austerlitz at
sevens, and Altairs at fives—but as neither was in the
hands of the starter, Mo. had to unload, and thus stand
a nasty knock through having laid a false price against
the ultimate winner (Destroyer) in the belief that Altairs
and Austerlitz would line up. One backer is said to have
supported all three named, and had the satisfaction of
getting his Altairs and Austerlitz money refunded and
collecting on Destroyer at the same time. The difference
between rules of the two States: had the same thing
occurred in N.S.W. backers of Austerlitz and Altairs
would have lost.
* * * •
Utter darned foolishness of horse nomenclature
begins to call loudly for A.J.C. action. Two nags at
recent Canterbury Park were entered as “ You’re-a-Liar ”
and “ You’re Another.” First-named is a three-year-old
colt by His Reverence from Atropos, and t’other is a filly
by the same sire from Blowingstone. Well-known Syd-
ney sport Mark Foy owns both. The latest horror is
“ Here-I-come-with-my-eye -knocked-ont” from Mel-
bourne.
* * * *
S.T.C. entries for May meeting closed Monday
and weren’t satisfactory by a great deal as far as the
lepping events are concerned. Fairly liberally endowed
(£175) Steeple only attracted half-a-dozen, without a
thorough good one among them, while Hurdles induced
10 —added money is 100 sovs. Twenty-six nominated for
May Stakes, 18 for Turf Clbb and 36 for Farewell Handi-
caps ; several top-notchers are included.

Famous brood mare Footstep, foaled in ’79 was
destroyed at Fulham Park t’other day through injuries
suffered. Mr. J. E. Savill was the first man to race
Footstep. She was by Countryman from Instep (imp )
whose family is regarded by many as the best Australia
can boast. Aura (dam of Auraria, Aurum and Aurous) is
a daughter of Instep. Another that lived to a reasonable
age was Sandal, who performed better than Aura or
Footstep. Footstep gave the Australian turf Footprint
The Admiral, Port Adelaide, Captain Cook, Roval Ad’-
miral, Fleet Admiral and Footbolt.
Four pious people, bent on securing practical
evidence of the great gambling curse, turned up at
a Maoriland trot and cast disapproving eyes upon
the “machine.” The “ goodies,” after many conscience-
qualms, decided to have a pound on among ’em, “just
to see how the thing worked.” Their horse won easily
and paid £4O, whereupon the excited quartette cabbed
it home, hilariously declaring that the tote wasn’t such
a dreadful thing after all.
• • • *
Yaldburst Stead has had phenomenal luck in
the 0.J.0. Champagne Stakes, Orloff (Stepniak—■
Sortie) who scored t’other day being his tenth successive
winner of that event, and the thirteenth since its estab-
lishment in ’74. Stead’s three first victories were with
Trenton, Maxim and Medallion. That galloping gem,
Cruciform, also notched two races at Christchurch, the
£lOOO Easter Handicap, under 9.9 (7 fur.) and the Tenth
Challenge Stakes, which she won last year. Stead
secured this race in three successive years with Multiform.
* • * •
The hook-nosed are in for a parlous time in
N.Q.; race clubs there are taking steps to completely
shut Mo. out as a menace to tote takings, which are
mainly depended upon to keep things going. Charters
Towers turfmen have taken the initiative and decreed
that backers of the “fee-uld” shall be absentees from
their May meeting. The persecuted are suffering much
anxiety of mind regarding the probable attitude of other
Northern racing bodies.

Someone went into the thing and ascertained
that the famous Tucka Tuclra nag Gozo had, during tht
past 10 years, sired 213 winners of 442 races, which meane
£68,100 in prize money. Another Tucka Tucka horse,
Metal (imp.), in eight years got 143 winners of 325 races,
worth £24,950.

How the tote helps a club was well shown at
last meeting of Adelaide Racing Club ; £725 in stakes
made a decent programme for an “ off ” afternoon.
£10,400 went through the machine (against £8250 last
year); commission, at 7£ per cent., £780—£65 more than
the stakes! And here are the dividends backers got:—
£lO 165., £7 25., £3175., £lO 55., £5 Bs., and £3 3s.

A real sporting event is the (English) National
Hunt Steeple, decided last month (and annually). Distance
four miles and a bit; a lot of it over ploughed land.
Prize, £lOO0 —£825 to winner, and four placed. Open to
all horses that have never won a race of any kind, and
12st. up. The day’s programme had seven events,
between 2 and 5 p.m.—four steeplechases, and the rest
hurdle races 1

A mare named Matamataharaki went out the

The graceful girl depicted in Fred Deist’s
sketch, printed in this issue, is Miss Kellermann, holder of
the Ladies’ 100yds., quarter-mile and mile championships
of N.S.W. She is the daughter of those well-known
musicians, Mr. Fred and Madame Charbonnet-Kellermann,
and is studying for a dramatic career. Swimming is her
favorite pastime, and Miss Kellermann is doubly lucky
in having been gifted with a passion for a pastime that
gives, in addition to pleasure, grace to the form and
beauty to the complexion. Swimming is an ideal pastime
for a lady studying for a dramatic future. The 100yds.
and quarter-mile championships were won some time ago,
but the mile championship was contested at Hellings’
Domain Baths (Sydney) on Monday week by a youthful
trio—Miss Kellermann, Miss Vera Buttel and Miss Dorothy
Hill. After the first three laps Miss Kellerman shot
away, and won easily by 150yds. in 33min. 49sec. Miss’
Buttel came second in 37min. 1 2-5 sec. This feat beat
the latest English lady’s record by no less than 6min.

At inter-State 8-oar race in Adelaide on May
10 all sections of the Commonwealth, bar Tas., will be
represented. Every crew has suffered through with-
drawals and patches. N.S.W. got the hardest knock
owing to stroke M'Gregor dropping out only a few weeks
before the convincing day. Westralians' embrace the
champion four of their section, and look like showing
well, though said to be under ’97 standard. Six of S.A.’s
team are veterans. Bananalanders are confident, and
will have much weight in their shell—two of them scale
over 13st. each. Victorians work strongly, and are getting
fine pace, though team has not been finally chosen.
Selection committee resent the V.R.A. committee’s chip-
ping in and taking the matter of filling vacancies out of
former’s hands.
• • * *
N.S.W. inter-State 8-oar crew shaped well in
their first outing in a racing-shell, Saturday. Most of
them belong to the long-backed and short-legged section
of man, and consequently are built for the game, but
there’s one among them of the spidery order, with limbs
particularly long and lathy, and a trunk somewhat
abbreviated, comparatively. The contrast is consequently
very noticeable. Though crew is doing well now it will
improve the next week or two. N.S.W.’s prospects are
not nearly so gray as a week or two back. Stroke
Hickson owns the record of having won 13 races in
succession.

According to English papers, A. C. Maclaren
doesn’t yet quite know whether he will play next season
for Hampshire (his old county) or Lancashire. The
secretary of the Hampshire club on the point “If it
came to a question of finance, Lancashire had plenty of
money behind it, and might outbid Hampshire for
Maclaren’s services.” Yet “Mr.” Maclaren would be
deeply pained if you hinted he was anything else but a
lily-white amateur. What is the English distinction
between amateur and professional ?
* * * *
Abo. Marsh’s deadly bowling was a big factor
in his club’s win of Sydney cricket supremacy. Finishing
struggle saw him send six opponents pavilionwards for
47. His season’s work (9’35 runs per wicket for 58)
stands unequalled. Though much below front-rank form
with the bat, Marsh is no duffer, contributions from him
average 6, with top score at 16. While Marsh’s deliveries
break bewilderingly, he can also send in switchbackers,
but most damage has so far been done by a medium-
paced ball that swerves and instantly breaks from the off
just when almost anything else might be expected.
* * * *
Vic. cricket season concluded on Saturday in an
awful state of muddle, leaving E. Melbourne nominal
winners, by default. First round, for which only two
Saturday afternoons were allowed, brought “ East” and
Oarlton together, a draw resulting. Though Carlton had
the better average, V.C.A. ordered a play-off. Carlton
skipper Worrall couldn’t gather a decent eleven ; so on
Saturday the Easterns scored by default.

Sydney first-grade cricket ended Saturday, when
Sydney 0.0. wiped Leichhardt-Balmain out by a wicket
and 115 runs.

Plugger Bilmartin had a parlous time making
his M.L. hour and 25-mile records. At 15m. the front
tyre punctured, and he lost 7min. fitting another wheel.
In the 24th mile the back tyre of the motor-tandem came
off, and pacers Sutherland and W. Palmer fell heavily.
Martin just escaped, and was paced by individual riders
until the hour ended. Spite of all, the ’Merkan marvel
covered the 25m. in 52min. 2 2-ssec., and traversed 27m.
1022yds. inside the 60min., thus cutting much off the
prior bests ; he also created a new sm. record for Aus-
tralasia by finishing that distance in 8.48 1 the previous
speediest (9.4-5) was also his.
S’African yellow-skinned bruiser Weiner again
scrapped with Sydney heavy-weight Jack Mason at
Golden Gate A.O. on Saturday night. Previously Weiner
won in seven rounds ; and it looked as if, with some im-
provement, Mason might win in another go. Return
match broke calculations all up, and after a white-heat
journey Weiner finished points to the good each round
till the third, when sustained heavy body punches
reduced Mason to a limp and weary condition that ended
in his being counted out in a state of collapse.
’Murkan bruiser, Jim Scanlan, badly slugged
Victorian “pug.” Sullivan at Sydney Gaiety A 0 last
week, and appropriated the fairly fat purse very easily
Sullivan came to the Gaiety management recommended
by feather champion Mick Walsh, and, looking the thing
in physique, was promptly matched, with disastrous
results to self and pug. business. He proved an utter
duffer, without knowledge or inclination, and thoroughly
scared from the jump. As there wasn’t a hole or a trap-
door to crawl through he “chucked it” in his corner
after round 2. The crowd hooted and screeched its dis-
gust, which was poor satisfaction for the coin parted
with. Old man Jim Barron, who acted as referee, just a
second or two before stripped himself to the waist
evidently anticipating something of a sheolish nature in
the next round, and it never came.
• * • *
“ Fedder ” bruiser “ Micko ” Walsh complained
to Melbourne sporting scribes that referee pu«\ Jack
Baxter, mutually agreed to by both, and apparently even
more acceptable to Walsh than Turner, was there to see
that Turner won, &c. ’Tis a thankless job to referee a
fight 1 Walsh hit low palpably, and, though cautioned at
least a dozen times, continued doing so, and plainly
courted an adverse verdict on a foul. If ever referee
appeared to lean towards one principal more than
another, Baxter did to Walsh, and yet no one in the
position has been more abused from the side most favored.
Having a decision given against him on a foul is certainly
no new experience for Walsh.

Inter-State thumping match ’tween Australian
light-weight premier pug Jack McGowan and ex-Broken
Hill miner-bruiser Mitchie brought a big crowd to Sydney
Gaiety A.O. Monday night as it looked like supplying
something uncommon in the way of fight. Each showed
tip-top condition and both were exceptions in the way
of physique—stocky-built, deep-chested, heavy-limbed,
exceptionally muscular, and hard as nails. For the whole
20 rounds only McGowan really fought while Mitchie’s
chief object was apparently to keep as far off possible
danger as the ropes would permit. When he did try to
do anything (which was rarely) his. efforts looked crude
against McGowan’s evasions. When opposed to his own
class Mitchie impresses more than favorably. Every
time he rushed bull-like Mac would elude' adroitly
and see his man flop to the boards on all
fours. If Mitchie found he couldn’t jig far enough
away he’d clinch and hang on like a wild cat. McGowan
got first blood early, and drove in some solid punches
about the stomach and face, besides a couple of telling
uppercuts, one of which might have brought about the
end but for the gong’s sending them to their corners
immediately afterwards. Mitchie scored a few times on
the back of the neck, and thrice on the mouth—all hard
blows, the latter lot bringing blood each time. Ulti-
mately McGown gained the palm on points, of which he
piled up a great stock, but it was a wearying thing. Pro-
bable future opponents of the stunted South Melbourne
giant, are Jack Willis, and George Johns, each of whom
may give him a switchback time.

“Stevenson, England’s champion billiardist,’
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ showed
immeasurable improvement in his recent match with
ex-champion Dawson, to whom he never ‘ gave a show.’
Quick, brilliant and consistent, his hundreds flew up in
minutes, and all his ‘ tail-down ’ nervousness of a year or
so back had absolutely fled. Thorough medical study of
and treatment for his nerves—which so often mar or
make the would-be crack——is said to be the secret of his
success. The ‘funk’ and the ‘cocktail’ at many con-
tests will, in the days to come, be made a hero by study
and treatment of his temperament. Stevenson is York-
shire born and S’African bred, a clean-limbed, fair,
shapely man of about 30.”

“Brumby”: Was recently present at a big
Sydney “two-up” school in full swing, and shuddered
when the spinner occasionally licked the “kip”—from
which the pennies are tossed. As each player spins in
turn, and the majority either lick or spit upon the kip,
one can imagine the interchange of microbes that goes
on. The same kip is generally in use for months —and
looks it. What a crop of untold horrors a bacteriologist
might produce from that little bit of wood !
* * * *
Sydney police raided some more at the “witch-
ing hour ” of Saturday last—this time an alleged “ two-
up school” at North Sydney, and something over half-a-
hundred people were bagged for “ heading ’em ” in a
building which precluded all possibility of the “ unco’
guid ” being offended in eye or ear. Meanwhile “ two-
up ’’and “ hazard ” schools flourish in the heart of the
city under the management of back-number pugs, &c.,
who have large well-paid staffs and wear diamonds and
jewellery and boast good bank-balances. Some of these
above gentry easily average a clear hundred a week over and
exes., and big sums are lost and won in all the schools
every night. Though profits are handsome every player
gets a straight deal in the actual gambling; that’s in-
sisted upon under pain of being shut out for varying
periods up to life and all eternity. As all “ schools,” in-
cluding the head one in Sheol, act together in these
cases, would-be swindlers hesitate to take risks.
He Suffered Much.
Cubed and Praises the Remedy.—
Indigestion and Biliousness Banished.
Mr. Samuel Cole, a resident of Woodend,
Vic., furnishes us with an instance of endur-
ance. He writes expressing his gratitude. It
is best told in his own words:—“ I have much
pleasure in writing to tell you of the many
benefits I have derived from the use of your
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. I have been a
great sufferer for some time with indigestion and
biliousness, for which I tried many patent
medicines, but received no benefit from any of
them until I used your pills. I commenced their
use by taking them according to directions, and
found, after taking three doses, that they had
made a great difference in my health; however,
I continued their use, and have now used several
bottles, and can honestly say they have cured me
of indigestion and biliousness, as I never have
an attack now. Since using these pills, I have
recommended them, and even given them, to
many, and the results have been good. You may
use this letter, as all I have stated in it is the
truth, and if anyone would like to know what
my case was like, I will be only too happy to tell
them.” Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a
perfect blood purifier, and a positive cure for
biliousness, indigestion, constipation, headaches,
sallow complexion, liver and kidney troubles,
piles, pimples, boils and blotches, and for
female ailments. Sold by chemists and store-
keepers, Is. l£d per bottle, or six bottles 6s. 6d.
Packed in amber bottles, and the full name blown
thereon.

Lake View Consols, March return, 6,2050 z. from
6,214 tons, but no particulars are given. Reporters have
received an invitation to view the mine, so that, for the
first time for years, independent opinions will be expressed
as to its workings. Whether the opinions formed on a
casual and hurried visit are worth much is another story.
» • • *
Great Boulder’s March output, 13,6740 z. from
8326 tons. For some reason or other the figures from
this mine have been rather erratic of late.
* * • *
Kalgurli’s output, announced as 29050 z. from
2600 tons—rather disappointing, as a larger tonnage was
promised. Costs given at 235. a ton ex administration-
expenses. Nothing said of mining costs. Extraction
alleged to be 92 per cent., but no one swallows this.
• » * *
Great Boulder Perseverance treated 12,302 tons
last month for 15,8380 z. —its record output. Manager
Nichols and his engineer (Blakesley) leave this week for
an extended trip abroad, and, during their absence, the
mine will be run by the shift boss, and the machinery be
supervised by Blakesley’s brother. This mine is now
experimenting with electric rock-drills, which are alleged
to work at twice the speed of compressed air-drills, with
considerably less horse-power.

Owing to the marvellous developments of the
Great Fingall Consols all sorts of rotters have been foisted
on the market under the glitter of that name. _ It should
be remembered that the Fingall Consols underits present
title, and previously as the Consolidated Murchison, has
been over seven years in existence, and that boundaries
were adjusted to take in everything of value. West Fin-
gall, a creation of Bewick, Moreing and Co., is an off-shoot
of the parent mine. Great Fingall South Blocks owes its
existence to Birkbeck, Hoffman and co., and Great Fin-
gall South to the Chaffers co. All three are well worth
leaving alone. Fingall Proprietary is a third reconstruc-
tion of the Cuddingwara, and was promoted by the
Paringa gang. It is situated in an entirely different dis-
trict, and the name is wholly deceiving.

The Queen Margaret, Bulong, continues to feel
very sick; last crushing (4840 z. from 768 tons) looks
decidedly ominous. The new 10-head stamps appear
wholly unjustified by developments. Strange how often
an increase of plant precedes a collapse 1

Associated management again to be changed.
Mr. Hewitson is to retire shortly, and, in future, to fill
the sinecure billet of consulting-engineer in London. As
Hewitson confirmed Hartmann’s management of Lake
View Consols, and has run the Associated at a loss, his
value as an adviser will not be too obvious to everyone.
Local press alleges that the continuation of the Brown
Hill-Iron Duke chute is in the property, but there is
absolutely no proof yet of the statement.

Kaufmann, on recent return to London, told
shareholders of Golden Horseshoe that the mine could
easily maintain an output of 18,000 to 20,0000 z. monthly
for years, and, were there room on the lease for the
stamps, could easily supply another 100 head with ore.
Doubtless the liquidator of the Standard Exploration
Co. would only be too glad to let the Horseshoe have for
a trifle the Golden Treasure’s 50 acres adjoining the
Horseshoe on the south. This was one of Kaufmann’s
own numerous hopeless flotations, which he so con-
veniently overlooks nowadays.

At recent meeting of Hannan’s Central Ex-
tended, chairman told shareholders that Kalgoorlie
Electric Power Co. offered to supply power for driving
battery, hoisting and pumping, including pumps and
hoists, at a total cost of £8 4s. 6d. a day, against a present
cost of £20 —a saving of over £4OOO a year. The Poyver
Co., after supplying the trams, will have a large surplus
of power for the mines, and its adoption will apparently
materially reduce costs, especially on small shows.
Hannan’s Central Extended has produced 75000 z. alluvial
gold and is practically a worked-out proposition.

Those scoffers who characterise Victoria’s brown
coal deposits as superior fire-resistine material have, just
now, a hard nut to crack in the Great Morwell mine. The
face of this mine is open—is, in fact, a steep cutting;
and back of this are millions of tons of coal. Accidentally
or purposely, someone lighted this face and, as the mine
is idle through a lawsuit, it got a good start before any-
one noticed it, and is now a wall of flame. The directors
put men on at once, but, as these have to hump water
150yds. and then splash it on from buckets, they are not
making much progress ; in fact, they are losing ground.
Brilliant Central (Charters Towers) record for
past half-year: 11,930 tons, value of products, £61,666.
Dividends £35,000. Probable that divs. will be Is. 6d.

but on £5 stone ought not more profit to be made ?

Prospectus of the Belleview G.M. Co. of N.W.
Australia glitters with gold. Expert reports that on an
initial expenditure of £4OOO the mine will return a profit
of £37,440 per year, with three years’ work in sight. Ibis
stated that for “ obvious reasons it is not desirable to dis-
close the exact location of the property.” As leases and
water rights have been secured the obviousness is rather
obscure. The Mystery G.M. Co. would seem a more
appropriate title. By the way, one or two of the
Sydneyites connected with the show have earned for
themselves a reputation for credulity—and bad luck.

Waihi (M.L.): Total production has now ex
ceeded £2,000,000. The 90-stamp mill is being converted
from dry to wet crushing, consequent on the increasing
percentage of sulphide in the ore and the necessity for
concentration. To maintain past profits there will have
to be an increase in ore-value.

The Nelson dredge, Greymouth (M.L.), the
other day, headed the list with 3050 z. for 132 hours’ work.
It is stated that the dredge has months of work on similar
wash. The average recent output of M.L. gold dredges
is given at about 31Joz. per week.

The vintage in S.A., now about over, is esti-
mated at about 2J million gallons of wine ; last year, it
was 2f millions, but that was a “record.” The summer
has been unusually cool, also unusually dry, and both
facts told against the productiveness of the grape.

Long Reef, Lennonville, one of Bewick,
Moreing and Oo.’s numerous daisies, which has migrated
three times, has closed its battery for six months—no
more stone in sight. Returns have gradually been tailing

quoted in neighborhood at 15s. ; now 35., and dear at that.

Teams are said to be competing successfully
with the railways between Sydney and Burraga (188
miles). It seems a strange state of things, but the man
who uses the railway has to pay interest on money
borrowed for construction purposes, and the man who
uses the road hasn’t. He only pays cost of haulage. If
there was only cost of haulage to be paid on the railways
freights might be cut down one-half.

The Deddickers are at work again upon the
Gippsland sympathies of the Vic. Govt. The syndicate,
which originally talked vaguely of a £300,000 undertaking,
has now boiled its proposals down to something more
definite and less satisfactory. Practically the syndicate
stipulates for the grant of 1000 acres at Mount Deddick at
a yearly rental of 11s. per acre, also the free grant of all
the Crown land required for a railway thereto, and Govt,
assistance towards obtaining other land on the line of rail-
way which is privately owned or let on lease, and in return
for all this it undertakes to expend £25,000 during the
next 20 years. As for the rest of the agreement it seems
to mean that the syndicate will construct some 90 miles
of standard gauge railway from Bairnsdale or Cunning-
hame to Mt. Deddick, provided that it floats its co. and
discovers the alleged rich mineral deposits in that much-
paragraphed district. But inasmuch as the railway
operations will presumably start from the precious
Mount, they are not likely to go very far before the
mineral question is decided one way or other. Should the
line come to pass, the Govt, will have the right to buy it
at cost price plus 5 per cent, interest within 12 years,
and if this means that the “land required for the railway”
is part and parcel with the constructed line, the possi-
bilities of the syndicate’s land-grab are confined to the
1000 acres at Mt. Deddick. And when—if ever—does the
11s. per acre lease expire ?
At Poverty Point.
A good deal of nonsense has been written about the
late “Billy” Emerson, “the greatest of all minstrel
players,” who seems to have gone rapidly to the dogs
after returning to America from his last Australian trip.
Emerson, although a graceful step-dancer in a very quiet
sort of way, and a pretty tenor singer, was never a
specially amusing “ turn.” His voice had a strain of
melancholy which suited maudlin ballads of the “ Little
Empty Cradle ” order, but cast a funereal gloom over his
addresses to “ Pretty Jane.” One remembers Emerson
for his dispiriting influence. His most successful item
the last time he visited Australia—a good many years ago
—was a song called “Could I only back the Winner,”
which Lance Lenton wrote for him. The doggerel ditty
had a hopeful sentiment, but poor Billy’s musical voice
converted it into a song of despair. One felt that the
weary minstrel was drifting towards impecuniosity and
the luck would never turn. It didn’t turn.
Lydia Yeamans-Titus, now contributing the star-turn
at Sydney Tivoli, has a voice good enough for opera and
an acting ability good enough for comedy, but she
probably finds, like many other clever people, that “ the
halls” bring in more money than “ legitimate work.”
An Australian by birth, her chief successes seem to have
been scored in America. The lady with the long name is
accompanied by a magnificent husband, with an impas-
sive face, imposing mannahs and noble clothes—altogether
a man of ideally-ducal aspect.
Salerno, now at Sydney Palace, allows the audience to
test the billiard balls which he balances between cues ;
and they are real ones. Nevertheless the feat strikes
many to be one of “magic” rather than balance ; it
seems incredible that three ivory spheres could be
balanced and then made to support a cue.
The “ Message from Mars ” co., much reconstructed
since Sydney and Melbourne saw the pretty little show,
has been doing great business in the West. Judging from
Perth notices Hawtrey has found a satisfactory substitute
for Herbert Ross. One Gregor Macmahon, who
graduated with the Brough co. in a minor capacity, is
said to play the part of Gilbert Parker a lot better than
was expected.
“‘Flyman” : Amy Castles on the concert platform and
Amy Castles in the street are two different personages.
In the street, Amy is much shorter than she appears to
be when singing to an audience. If it were not for her
expressive dark eyes her face would be lacking in anima-
tion ; that she is doubly attractive beneath the gaslight
indicates that she has the proper artistic temperament,
which is only roused under certain conditions. There is
a rumbling note of sadness in the Castles boom. Amy
Castles is still a mere girl, and she is getting the wild
adulation of the crowd before she has w'orked for it.
Her sisters, cousins and aunts are all elated, but the man
who got up at 6 a.m. to get his ticket to see a much-
boomed singer is wondering now why he did it.
Rickards has put vim into the net-ball game at Melb.
Opera House by offering a prize of £lO to the team
scoring most goals during the season ; and how the girls
do roll into the contest! They bump one another on the
floor with all their might, hair is pulled down and
blouses are torn in the rousing scuffles. Considering
that football scrimmages, not half so rough, frequently
end in a male player being left standing “ mid nodings
on," the chances are that, ere the net-ball season is over,
some damsel will find herself before the audience in a
condition that will make Madame Lotty’s subsequent act a
tame and unrealistic affair.
R. Needham, the baritone of the Amy Castles co. (he
didn’t appear fit the Melb. concerts) is a Maorilander who
gave up a promising billet in a Melbourne business house
when the present Engagement offered. Boss Williamson
heard him for the first time at Bendigo and was taken by
his singing, whilst Dani greeted the new-comer—in
English—and told him he had “ lofely voice.” A plump
tenor who is going strong can afford to be generous to an
unknown baritone. -Needham will pick up popularity as
he goes along.

Sandow, the strong man, starts his engagement to

At Katoomba (3,300 ft. above sea-level

WINCHESTER
MODEL 1900 SINGLE-SHOT RIFLE
m
HIS rifle sells at a price within reach of almost every-
body’s pocketbook, but it is made with the same care and
exactness as Winchester rifles that cost five times as
much. The name “Winchester” on this rifle is a
guarantee in itself of its quality. The Model 1900 is a
hammerless take-down, and can be taken apart easily
and quickly. It is made with an 18-inch round barrel,
fitted with open front and rear sights. It shoots .22 Short and .22
Long Rim-Fire cartridges, and Bullet Breech caps. These cartridges cost
so little that one can afford to shoot as many times as he likes as often
as he likes. Some makes of .22 Caliber rifles are a few pence cheaper,
but they are a great deal cheaper in quality than they are in price.
We don’t try to see how cheap we can make this rifle, but how good.

Nature’s Triumphant Remedy
Kutnow’s Powder
The Infallible Remedy for
Constipation, Stomach, Kidney
Trouble, Liver Torpor, Gout,
Rheumatism, and Uric Acid
Diseases.-^^^
KUTNOW’S POWDER is acknowledged to be the
proper remedy for all such ailments.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is a perfect organic cleanser
and the safety-valve of health. It has the same medicinal
curative and healing properties as the waters of the Royal
and Imperial European Spas, without their drastic and
lowering effects.
KUTNOW’S POWDER possesses the power of eliminat-
ing the poison produced in the blood from an excess of bile
and acids. The use of KUTNOW’S POWDER thereby
gives tone to the system; and, in assisting to build up
healthy tissue, becomes the first aid to a vigorous consti-
tution.
Beware of Fraudulent
Imitations.
KUTNOW’S POWDER may be obtained in capsuled bottles, of
all Chemists and Medicine Vendors. See that the Registered Trade
Mark, “ Hirschensprung ” (or Deer Leap), and the autograph facsimile
signature, “S. KUTNOW and Co. (Ld.),” are on the label and carton.
ONLY THESE ENSURE GENUINENESS. INSIST ON
“KUTNOW’S,” AND FIRMLY REFUSE ANY SUBSTI-
TUTES ; THEY ARE WORTHLESS AND OFTEN INJURIOUS.
Constipation neglected or unskilfully
treated becomes habitual or chronic, and
is responsible for most of the ills which
flesh is heir to. Most people, when sick,
whether from INDIGESTION, DYS-
PEPSIA, BILIOUSNESS, SICK
HEADACHE, FLATULENCE, NAU-
SEA, SOUK ERUCTATIONS,
VOMITING, or HEARTBURN, fly to
the aid of drastic purgatives, pills, salts,
or noxious oils, the use of which means a
passing relief, but which (as most medi-
cal men declare) afterwards increase the
constipation, and thereby accentuate the
ailment. Of all the innumerable reme-
dies (offered to the public) for the cure of
constipation there is only one which
absolutely meets the natural necessities
of this frequently recurring evil—viz.,
KUTNOW’S POWDER, the safety-
valve of Health.
4
KUTNOW’S POWDER is
used in all the
principal Hospitals
throughout the
Universe, including
the Field Hospitals
in South Africa.
DR. BRACHET.
Head Physician at the Baths at Aix-les-Bains,
in writing, said :
“For patients suffering from disorders of the Stomach, Liver, and
Bowels I have prescribed ‘KUTNOW’S Improved Effervescent
Carlsbad POWDER,’ and by its aid obtained the best results. Have
prescribed the powder for about a year in my hospital practice here, as
well as frequently for my private patients, and find it also efficient in
Gout and Rheumatism. I consider KUTNOW’S POWDER indis-
pensable to persons travelling.”
SIR JOHN B. MONCKTON,
Town Clerk of London,
writes:
“Guildhall, London, E.C., Nov. 4th, 1901.
“Gentlemen, —I have much satisfaction in stating that for the last
two years I have regularly used KUTNOW’S POWDER, with the
result that troublesome and frequent attacks of lumbago, with
other gouty symptoms that had troubled me for years, seem
to have entirely disappeared. “Yours truly,
“ JOHN B. MONCKTON.”

“Entirely unsolicited, I am anxious to bear my testimony to the
wonderful results of your ‘Carlsbad Powders.’ For a long period I

thought I would give them a trial, and am more than satisfied with the
result. Life is a pleasure and free from pain, feel very much stronger,
and can, with the utmost confidence, recommend them. As an act of
justice to you, as well as suffering humanity, cannot withhold my testi-
mony to the worth of your powders.

Or its tones can be modulated to the soft, sweet tones of the German Zither.
In addition to its wonderful tone quality, the Harp-Zither has a great many
advantages over all other Zithers. It is the only Zither which may be played
while holding vertically like the Harp, or it may be laid upon a table, as is
necessary with the ordinary Zither.
Observe the diagonally crossed strings, almost the same as in a piano, the
melody strings passing over the chord strings. By means of this improvement
in construction the similarity in tone and volume of the piano is produced.
Beautiful in Design, Grand, Resonant Tone, Perfection in Every Point,
and it is the easiest to learn to play of any musical instrument in existence.
A child can play it almost at sight. The reason anyone can play this instru*
ment on first trial, even though the person may know absolutely nothing
about music, or may not have an ear for music, is this : Each string is num-
bered, as is each note in the music, so all one has to do to render the most
difficult selections is to strike the strings as indicated by the numbers; hence
we guarantee that anyone able to read figures can learn to play.
The Harp-Zither is built on the lines of the large harp which sells at
£2O and upwards, and to the astonishment of all the Harp-Zither has the
louder tone of the two ; in fact, its tone is similar to that of a piano.
PF" SATISFACTION GUARANTEED -»B
As a parlor ornament, the instrument, with its classical outlines, is
unique. For the serenade, the musicale, or any class of entertainment, the
Harp-Zither excels all other instruments of its class. Its Deep, sympathetic
Tones Penetrate even those Insensible to the Charms of Music.

HERR RASSMUSSEN (HANS PETER RASMUSSEN),
The Celebrated Danish Botanist,
Proprietor and Discoverer of the World-Famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies,
which have been the means of effecting the most marvellous Cures for Blood,
Skin and Nervous Diseases ever heard of in Australia.
Herr Rassmussen’s Australian Career:
It is about Twenty Years since Herb
Rassmussen introduced his Herbal Remedies
to the Australian Public. At that time
he was only known to the public as a Botanist
pure and simple, having devoted almost his
whole life to the study of that most useful
and interesting branch of science. It how-
ever, soon dawned on Herb Rassmussen that
immense virtues existed in many plants which
were entirely unknown to medical men, and
that it was his duty towards his fellow man
to bring these new discovered Herbal Remedies
within the means of suffering humanity.
Herb Rassmussen at once set to work,
and his entire energy was directed towards
extracting the medical properties from all
kinds of plants, and putting them up in the
most suitable and practical form, according
to the nature of the complaints which they
had been found a cure for.
Pills and Powders were found to be the
most practical form to administer these new
Herbal Remedies.
It is unnecessary to particularise here the
immense success Herb Rassmussen met with
in his venture twenty years ago ; suffice it to
say that in less than twelve months the
great and wonderful cures brought about by
his Alfaline Herbal Remedies were known
throughout Australia, New Zealand, and many
other parts of the world. Testimonials and
Honors arrived from all parts. Gold Medals
from Paris and other places were awarded, and
Herr R ass muss ion’s name has been a house-
hold word ever since. (Sydney JPress.J

Percy Rampage, or Ramage, the notorious
Vic. prisoner, is now in Pentridge again, where a
special labor-yard and a special cell and special
warders are detailed for him. He is the most
celebrated kicker of his day. The first sentence
he served was for kicking a cab-horse to death.
He pleaded that the ‘ ‘ bloomin’ ’orse ” started on
him first.
“Kakapo ” uttereth a groan :
Gore (Maoriland) is populated principally by Sandy and
Mac, who wear oatmeal in their speech and thistles in
their whiskers. It is represented in Parliament by
the M‘Nab. The Mayor is M‘Gibbon. Everybody else
is M‘Something or other. Nearly all the women are
called Agnes, and almost everybody goes to bed at nine.
As a young man Ketchener ran away from
Woolwich to enlist under General Chanzy in
1870, and he fought bravely in the French Army
of the Loire right through the campaign. When
the war was over he came back to England, and
it was only by very powerful influence that he was
allowed to resume his military studies.

30 Days’ Report on Lame Back.
Bulli, April 9th, 1902.
THE DR. McLAUGHLIN COMPANY, Sydney.
Dear Sirs,—lt gives me the greatest of pleasure to state,
in answer to your letter, that the Electric Belt I got from
you has done my back a world of good. The pains in my
back are not nearly so bad ; also, my general health is much
improved. I have been wearing the Belt a month now, and
expect to be completely cured in two more months.—l
remain, yours gratefully,
HENRY HALSEY.
c
DO you want to be strong? Do you want to feel the vim, the snap, the fire of
vigor ? Do you want courage, energy, and ambition to support you in your cares
and troubles ?
We have devoted many years to the development of vigor m both men and
women. We’ve made a great success. Our methods are approved by the greatest doctors,
and copied. . „ , ... , ,
We have proven that electricity is the basis of all animal life, and that weak men,
dyspeptics, rheumatics, sufferers from inertia, weak kidneys, pains in the back, head,
chest, and shoulders, are weak in electricity. Our Electric Belt restores this life in a lew
weeks, and cures every case where specially recommended.
The weak man does not live who cannot be made a better man by wearing our
Electric Belt. None of us are perfect, and anything that will add more to such vitality
as we may have will make us better. It is hard for a weak man to have noble sentiments.
Such things are born of warm blood, healthy nerves, and a strong heart.

ELECTRIC BELT
Does Wonders for the Afflicted. IT CURES AFTER ALL ELSE FAILS.
See what this Man says of it.
Dear Sirs,—lt is with the greatest pleasure and feeling of gratitude that I bear witness to the
excellence of your Electric Belts. Sometime ago I sustained a heavy fall, and ruptured the big
muscle in the back. I was in great pain, and after two weeks in bed I happened to see your adver-
tisement in a newspaper. I got one of your high-grade Belts, and after a week I felt very itvuch
better, and after the second week I was, and am now, as well as I was before the accident, l still
wear the Belt for two hours every evening, and feel the benefit of it. It has not only cured me
in two weeks (although the doctor attending me told me it would be months before I would get
well), but it has made my back very much stronger than before the accident. I strongly advise all
with pain in the back to try your Electric Belt, and I shall be very pleased to give all information
personally to anyone. . ~
I remain, dear Sirs, yours gratefully,
Darling Point, N.S.W. ROBERT YE RON.
Congested Kidneys, Sciatica.
Mounting Home Steed, Martinville, N.S.W., March 28th, 1902.
THE DR. MCLAUGHLIN COMPANY. , „ , ... .
Dear Sirs,—lt gives me great pleasure to state, in answer to your letter, that my health is very
much improved since I have been wearing the Electric Belt I got from you. The very second time
I put it on I could feel the benefits immediately, and I have been only wearing it six weeks to-night.
I feel very much better all over my body, and whereas it was a misery to sit down or walk before
I got the Belt, now it is just a pleasure. The day I left my home to see you I had no life m me, and
felt as though life was a burden to me, and, as it was, I was simply a WALKING MISERY. But
I thank God I came to you for the Belt, and I cannot tell you how glad I am, for I feel so much
better, especially with the pains in my legs ; in fact, I am better all over, and it is just wonderful.
You can do what you like with this letter, and if it will be of any benefit to let my fellow-sufferers
know, I will be only too pleased for them to write to me, when I will be able to tell them how bad I
really was before I got the Belt. lam telling my own personal friends all about the wonderful cure,
and I do not want to make any secret of it at all. „ TT __ XT

Epitaph satirically said to have been chosen
by millionaire Carnegie for his tombstone
Here lies a man who knew how to get round him a
great many men much cleverer than himself.
Premier Barton stated in the press last
Tuesday that when he goes to England to be
button-holed and earwigged by the astute
Chamberlain he “ will not take any important step
of policy which will commit the Federal Parlia-
ment without first consulting that Parliament,”
etc. This would be good enough if it came from a
man whose assurance could be relied upon, but
Barton gave his equally solemn promise that
he wouldn’t commit the Commonwealth to
the despatch of a Federal contingent without
consulting Parliament, and his word on that occa-
sion proved to be less negotiable than an abori-
ginal’s promissory note, and a great deal less
accurate than Schalk Burger’s war despatches.
Now, having proved that his word is not binding
on him when Chamberlain invites him to break it,
Barton offers the broken object again as security
on a most vital point. Australia wants something
better than that.
Sydney D.T. gets from Maoriland a flat
contradiction of Premier Seddon’s disavowal of
his disgustingly blood-thirsty speech at Papawai:
His speech on that occasion was taken by two of the
most competent reporters in the colony, whose notes
agree on every point. The speech was published in every
paper in the colony, and was the subject of many con-
demnatory editorials and deprecatory resolutions by
ministers’ and other associations. The accuracy of the
report was never even questioned by Mr. Seddon in
subsequent speeches.
But who on earth believed Seddon’s obvious
falsehood? He spoke after dinner at Papawai
and, when the dinner is in, the truth of a man’s
nature comes out. Now, in more sober and more
politic mood, Mr. Seddon wants to disclaim senti-
ments unsuitable even for an ex-pugilist, and he
disclaims them with a falsehood. Well, The
Bulletin welcomes even the lie; it shows some
shame.

Of London, England, from which you will glean that

it was.—Yours faithfully,

««Dear Sir, —I wish to add my testimony to the won-
lerful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I suffered for nine
nonths, and the cough was so distressingly bad at nights
i was obliged to get up and sit by the fire. I had medical
.dvice, and tried other ‘ remedies,’ without, avail. I tried
rours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
lrst dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
un a different man, and the cough has vanished. You
nay depend upon my making known the efficacy of your
voiiderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.
“ Yours faithfully,
“ JAMES ASTBURY."

When Kossuth, the Hungarian patriot,
visited England, he was treated by all classes
like a prince, the populace sometimes taking
the horses out of his hired carriage and draw-
ing the vehicle themselves. This was most
irritating to the Austrian Government. Also, the
English lost no opportunity of showing their sen-
timental sympathy with Poland in her hopeless
struggles against Russia, and with the rebel,
Garibaldi. But the same people got their hair
off when a little ordinary civility was shown by
America, France, and Germany to Kruger’s peace-
envoys.
“X.” moralises :
A returned soldier applied, recently, in Melbourne, for
a “ Bottle O! ” license. Beak Panton, in a voice choking
with emotion, patriotism and flabbergastedness, granted
the application, and hoped the hero would soon be able to
get into a better position, which, considering that many
returned cohentingenters cannot get a position at all,
sounds somewhat like irony. I wonder how the soldier-
slobberers of Melbourne—say, for instance, Purves, Madden
or Pitzgibbon—would act if they found said “ Bottle O ! ”
in their back premises. Would they enthuse over the
hero who fought for the Hempire, and bring him in as a
brother to the whisky and roast goose ? Or would they
order an extra-sharp look-out to be kept on him, owing to
the experience he must have gained in Boer back-yards ?


PLEASURE!
THE -TCOLIAN
has become so important a factor
of pleasure in so many homes, and
especially in the homes of those
whose names are synonymous with
culture and refinement, that it is an
object of interest to everyone who
gives any thought to his own or his
family’s pleasure.
Because one man likes a certain article is no proof that another will.
When, however, enthusiasm for the same article steadily increases
from year to year, there is conclusive proof that it must have unusual
value. The man who does not give himself a fair oppottunity to
learn what this value is, cuts himself off from the means of judging the
benefit he might derive from it.

Plumptoniana.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Alfred Plumpton, news of whose recent death
in London is cabled, was a man of many sides
—like and unlike Gladstone. The stoppage of
his pendulum makes a silence, through which
curious memories arise—some only to be greeted
with Mephistophelean sniggers in Melbourne clubs
and coteries, others quotable. _
Alfred was the best musical critic, one of the
best musicians, and the hardest-working con-
ductor in Australia. A fearful and wonderful
worker in every way and from early days, his face
bewrayed him. A light thatch of hair on a skull
rather coned than domed; weak eyes behind
heavily-rimmed, gold spectacles ; anaemic com-
plexion, and spare figure. His time of best pro-
mise was when Tasca gave him her hand, for
Carlotta Tasca could write sweet verses, and
Alfred knew all about wedding word and note;
but of that promise there was not much fulfilment.
Poor Tasca !
Alfred in those days conducted the best choir in
Melbourne. He had his own methods. An ora-
torio chorus was once in rehearsal, and he tried for
an hour to get out some decent interpretation of
its sentiment. It was quite in vain till, quitting
all musical terms and usual methods, he flung
down the baton, spectacles, and score on the floor
together, and asked in the name of the Trinity
how they imagined their row was anything like the
voice of the people crying in the —ahem ! wilder-
ness. When at his work, that cry, as any other
great sentiment or passion, possessed him utterly.
When work was over it was sometimes otherwise.
Not always undesirably so.
There are still a few in Melbourne who remem-
ber nights or mornings when Alfred, with old
Zerbini and Rhymer, who played the big fiddle as
few others could, till spiritualism (not spirits)
bedevilled him, and Keiley of The Argus, who
knew all the literature of music and could have
talked down even Dr. Samuel Johnson, would sit
in a ring. Sometimes the piano or violin
would show what somebody really meant, and he
who sat on ihe outskirts of the ring grew wiser.
Now the last part of the ring is gone, and with
them good old Julius Herz and David Lee, who
were hardly of the same class, yet in their way
good. And they did queer things in their lives.
Four of them—Plumpton, Keiley, Zerbini, and
David Lee —sat about a table at 2 am., and grew
hot in argument over the authorship of a “Dead
March” ascribed to Beethoven. “We’ll go
across,” said David Lee, who had the key of the
house —that house being the Town Hall right
opposite. Two candles were borrowed, the
watchman opened the doors, and in the vasty
space, feebly illuminated, the tattered old score
was spread on the keyboard of the great organ,
and unmistakeable Beethoven pealed out. The
thunder of the thing, the incongruous weirdness
of all the surroundings, come back strangely now
when we know that the four of them are in their
graves.
And how many more with them, good men of
the same set who made things too hot, and other-
wise went off through an incomprehensible
ordination of affairs —“ Augur ” Chapman, of the
Australasian; “TheVag.”; Garnett, that frail
but lovable brother of the old chief of the British
Museum; old Grattan Riggs—but why continue
the count? It is doubtful if those who linger
have the best of it.
Alfred Plumpton had a Devil of audacity, a
mine of resource in him, which nothing could
subdue or exhaust. He picked up (as the tall
spire of a city church falls over a row of houses,
and hardly in benediction) a ghoulish, lemur-like
shadow, but it could not smother him. He had
bailiffs at his heels for decades, but they could not
spoil either his work or play.
TTis last big work in Australia was in the con-
ducting, actually the making, of “Paul Jones,”
when Miss Nellie Stewart for a while took the
responsibilities of management. There were two
ends to that season. One was high festival when
the business was practically over. It was mild.
One o’clock, the stage all ablaze beyond the empty
auditorium ; Nellie, queen of her court of princi-
pals, chorus and ballet. Law, medicine, com-
merce and finance, just as well represented as
letters and art; champagne fizzing, chicken-and-
turkey and pate-de-foie-gras and caviare vanish-
ing. Big Dr. Wilmot hardly needing a chair, so
easily he towered over all the others, proposing
healths. Mirth it was, hearty and free and with-
out much madness. Two o’clock and Alfred
orating, insisting everywhere and in everything
on the “ same old graft. ” Three, and everybody
talking, hats and ties making open proclamations
in the light that had no mercy. Four, and the
stage thin, but all the doors open and half-a-
hundred cabs outside. Enter then, uninvited,
bookmaker and ex-pugilist, a music-hall man
volunteering 1 ‘ Knocked ’Em in the Old Kent
Road,” just to wind up the show. Curtain then,
as was proper.
But Alfred had a benefit. He wanted the pro-
ceeds—so did some other people. All through
the rehearsals of the season there had been in-
terruptions, men approaching the conductor’s
desk with a furtive step and bits of blue paper
from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. “There’s
plenty of room on the file, put it with the rest.
And the baton did not miss a beat. But a busi-
ness man who let rooms and sold pianos insisted
on dividing, and couldn’t be put off with any
promises. “I must have half the ‘door ’or I will
put in a receiver and arrest you the minute the
curtain goes down.”
“What is to be, will be,” replied Alfred, and
the night arrived. The business man was at the
gate, the writ of attachment in the bailiff’s pocket.
But, when the curtain rang up another man ap-
peared at the conductor’s desk. The beneficiare
was on the high seas, homeward-bound with the
balance of £l5O (for which he had sold the house a
month before) safe under his belt.
They wanted him in London. He started work
within a week of his arrival and kept right on till
a day or two back. The Old Fellow, who Can’t be
Put Off, called then, and Alfred passed in his
checks, doubtless just as composedly as he used to
pay out at hazard.

A carious action was lately brought against a
Wanganui (M.L.) shopkeeper under the Photograph
Copyright Act. A railway-clerk contracted to
represent the tradesman at a poster-ball in the
character of “Monkey Brand Soap.” He was
photo’d; and subsequently the shopkeeper had the
beauteous picture reproduced in the press as an
advt. Life was thus made a burden to the poor
clerk and hence the action. Judge Kettle, how-
ever, ruled that the disguised picture wasn t a
proper “ portrait ” of prosecutor, as defined by the
Act, and dismissed the case.
“Getting Up”: An Idyll of
Dairy Farming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m staying as a visitor at an Illawarra dairy
farm. The “cottage” is built of slabs —ventila-
tion, consequently, excellent. The interior is
canvas-partitioned into queer-shapen rooms ; the
minutest sound flies round the whole building.
The girls put in last night at Fitzgeralds’ Circus ;
I heard them come in at one, so they’ve only had
three hours’ sleep. So there is a hoarse noise of
throat-clearing, and thump! thump I towards 4
o’clock.
“Bless me sowl an’ body! Past 4 o’clock!
Hey, girls! Mary-Ann, Selina, Elizabeth, Kate!
git up ! The sun’s risin’ over the ’ills. Come on,
now, no dodgin’! ”
Audible yawns and sighs from various rooms.
“Eh—(ah-h) —wasser matter ?” followed by idiotic
laughter from one dreaming of the clown.
Ten minutes later. The silence is painful. A
fierce grunt from the old man, who has turned in
for five minutes more. “ What ! ” in stentorian
tones, “not up yet? Confound the girls ! Mary-
Ann ! Selina ! ELIZABETH, KATE ! ”
Chorus of “ Orlright, father,” (yawns) “we’re
gittin’ up ! ”
“ Well, git up, then, confound ye ! D’yer want
to miss the milk-train ?” The old man turns in
again.
Fifteen minutes later. Silence deeper than
ever. Noise as of a body flinging out of bed. He
is wild now. This is unprecedented. Then fol-
lows such a stream of lurid imprecation and
oblique blessing on the heads of those devoted
girls as fairly frightens them. I am lost in
admiration at the vast resources of his vocabulary.
Hurried sounds of dressing are heard—boots
bumping, water splashing, etc. —followed by
clumping footsteps towards the back door.
The boss is up himself now. I hear him at the
men’s room outside. They had finished up the
night with a howling spree. Hence, instead of
having the cows yarded, they are snoring in
delightfully regular alternation. Bill’s is a high
baritone snore ; Dan’s a sepulchral bass rivalling
Fob’s deepest efforts. Alternated they are un-
speakable ; in unison they are like the noise of a
trombone played by a grampus.
“Dan ! Bill ! ” —sharply. The snoring deepens.
It is in unison now. One has turned over.
“Dan !—blast—Bill! —curse— Dan Bill ! Yer
goin’ to lay in all the blanky day ? Any one ’d
think yer was gittin’ a thousand a year,” sarcas-
tically. (Just bore, Bill, dreaming of the goat-
and-monkey turn, the night before, ejaculates
encouragingly : “Go it, ole feller, keep it up ! ”)
“ Keep it —gurroo-o ! ” He is almost speechless.
“Where’s my —flamin’—(gasp)—whip? I’ll cut
the blessed tongue —(gulp)—outer yer, yer pair o*
55
The rest is a sort of inarticulate gurgle. His
rage has got into his throat. It next flies to his
head, which promptly becomes a battering-ram,
directed at the door.
Commotion heard in the room. They’ve never
known the old man as bad as this before. Slipping
on shirt and pants, they await their chance.
“ Now ! ” But, just as they open the door, he is
in the act of hurling himself against it. He
strikes nothing, and brings up against a broken
bedpost, causing a rush of air that fairly whistles.
The men dodge the water-jug and two boots,
and flee for the paddock. Their flight is accele-
rated by various missiles. The old man hurls
himself after the missiles. Despairing of further
sleep, I followed the old man.
And this is one way of “getting-up,” on an
Illawarra dairy-farm.

A Sydneyite lately wrote to an Italian
convent —which possesses the secret of a reputed
cure for rheumatism —to secure the sole Aus-
tralasian agency, and promised if this were given
him to advertise the nostrum well. He got this
in reply, addressed to “Sir Jones ” :
Sir, —I reply directly to your request with send to you
the prospects that you have kindly asked to me. We are
very grateful to you for your kindness in will propagate
the cure of our powders ; therefore when you will ask
them I shall send as soon as possible also for more years
of cure. The cost of one years of powders is frs 50 more
frs : 10 for expenses of carriage, which they are same also
for more years of cure ; but it is impossible to sell you
our powders empower. We have had many request from
the best pharmacies and Personages of all contries but
we cannot give this privilege to anybody because we are
forbidden to do so by a article of our statutes.— Believe
us to remain, Sir, most cordially yours truly,

“Investigatrix,” re the “selfishness” of
women as commented on by a person in authority :
Many women who, judging by results, take “pre-
cautions ” against a large family, are, to Lhose children
they possess, devoted and self-sacrificing mothers. And
there are wheels within wheels. The ordinary husband
does not, theoretically, object to a large family, but he
does object—and at times very unpleasantly—to the cur-
tailed domestic comfort and increased expenditure it
necessitates. And the woman—never very logical where
her feelings are keen—often fails to appreciate this fine
line of distinction, and acts accordingly. The most
gentlemanly husband, with a limited income, invariably
persists, in a resigned and gentlemanly way, in regarding
his wife as the culpable factor in the size of the family.
Also the ultra-fastidiousness of an advanced civilisat ion
has something to answer for—the etiquette of rearing
children isn’t what it used to be. The type of woman, who,
20 years ago, was content to sit down placidly to sew while
the children made dirt-pies in the sun, must now, unless
she would lose caste in the suburban terrace, change their
clothes, curl her own front hair, and put forth the after-
noon tea-set. That these inferences are not wholly incor-
rect is borne out by the fact that in the Real Bush, where
the cost of actual living is small, and manners primitive,
in spite of drought, water-famine and mortgaged home-
steads, the babies still continue to arrive with some
regularity.
Two comparative diet-scales :
For human beings in the
British Government’s Con-
centration Camps in
S’Africa—as set out in the
Blue Book :
Weekly.
Vlbs. flour.
ioz. salt.
6oz. coffee.
12oz. sugar.
21bs. meat sometimes
uneatable (to some of the
prisoners only).
For cats In a cats’ home
—according to evidence
given in West London
Police Coart, Saturday,
December 21,1901: —
Daily.
For breakfast: Quaker
Oats boiled with milk and
water, or bread and milk.
For dinner: Cats’ meat,
or raw beef steak.
For five o’clock tea :
Milk.
For supper : Rice and
fish.
The starvation dietary scale of the concentration
camps, as officially set forth by the British
Government, is about the clearest explanation
yet given of the appalling mortality in these
hunger-holes.

PEARS
Autumn Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Leaden olouds that fold and fold }
Yellow leaves all sighing !
Oh ! the world seems very old,
For the Autumn’s dying.
Grey the sky is—bleak and grey—
And the gaunt trees swaying,
Seem in undertones to say,—■
Death is past delaying.
Withered bark, all spiritless,
Swings a-moan ere falling ;
Oh, the young gums’ nakedness !
Oh, the ourlews calling 1
I rom the eaves faint twitt’rings oome
As a swoop-hawk passes ;
But the song-birds all are dumb ;
Dead are all the grasses.
Gloom is on the nearer hills,
Not a leaf’s shade ohanges ;
Drought has found the mountain-rills,
Darkness smites the ranges.
Death seems ruling all the land;
Oh, the sere leaves sighing !
Life, the King, at his command,
Dying ! dying ! dying !
MILKY WHITE
A Royal Theatre-Party.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Why, look ! There they come ! ”
No outriders. No display. Two carriages dash
past, down a dark lane at the back of the Adelphi.
A few bystanders press forward. A couple of
police move them back. We are bound for the
theatre. They let us pass. A man’s voice,
woolly with drink, cries: “Come back; I’m as
equal as you ! ”
We wait in the gay, crowded lobby a minute.
These tall women, with heads held high and
shoulders well thrown back, with hair dressed
loosely on top, devoid of curl or crimp, are
Americans. Englishwomen don’t carry them-
selves that way. Grace and deportment are the
special privileges of Parisians and Americans in
London. Beside them, Englishwomen cut poor
figures. Royalty gets in a back-stairs way.
When we enter at last, it is there. The house has
just finished clapping ; the Queen ceases bowing ;
the King also.
Our seats are opposite their box. The play is
“Arizona.” It's charming, tender, simple,
funny, dramatic, and exquisitely acted. It
is our luck to have seen it before—to know it
almost by heart. We are free to turn our
eyes from it and give all our attention to those
four figures in the box nearest the stage. First,
the Queen ; then the King ; then Princess Charles
of Denmark ; finally, Princess Victoria, nearest
the stage. In the adjoining box are three
members of the King’s suite, and one lady-in-
waiting to the Queen —»• very plain and unfashion-
able lady, be it said.
Naturally, necessarily, the Queen first. Is she
not the one picturesque figure of the whole Royal
menage ? And so this, then, is the Queen, this
narrow, slender, small-faced smiling lady in black.
An impression stamps itself vividly on the
brain. She is “made up.” The eye detects in-
stantly something incongruous—something arti-
ficial. After awhile the impression is softened.
The artificial becomes less evident. The first
vision of powder, paint, and false hair yields a
little. She seems to grow younger. But there
always remains in the back of the brain that first
impression—the painted lips, the wig, the utter
absence of youth—of real, genuine youth. How
could it be there, indeed ? But we have been led
to expect it. ‘ ‘ The Queen looks younger than her
daughters,” they say. Not at first glance, not till
the eye accustoms itself to the unnatural conditions
of her face, till it grows blind to enamel and car-
mine, and is no longer struck with the falseness of
her hair—by then we are able to discover that
the Queen is, indeed, in a way, a lovely woman.
Her face is cut like a cameo. As she turns it
upwards or sideways, the contour is always beau-
tiful. The nose is chiselled, the chin is neither
full nor bony. Her mouth has no expression
whatever except a little, masked smile. She bites
her lips continually. She looks gentle, vapid,
expressionless. Very slight about the neck and
shoulder. She sits erect, with a delicate, easy, and
yet pronounced erectness. She is gowned in
black lace, has long transparent sleeves, and is
not in the least decolletee. Her frock is high-
necked. The transparent collar ends in a high
band of black velvet. Her gloves are pale grey
suede, and she wears a diamond necklace and a
little diamond bird in the middle of her fringe,
but far back. The hair, a light nut-brown, not
golden, not auburn. It cleverly avoids the
error of being false in either of these two shades,
commonly consecrated to the wig or the dye. It
is as natural as possible. Only for one’s first im-
pression it is impossible, after a time, to believe it
isn’t genuine. Curled all over the top, and
brought low down on the forehead in a curled
fringe, then rolled and coiled all up the back, the
effect is stiff and devoid of character. That
heavy fringe would rob any face of character.
A sweet, fragile woman, with a hint of endur-
ance and patience about her mouth, a fleeting ex-
pression of wistfulness, of shrinking, in her eyes ; a
graceful woman, incapable of a hard word, or a
harsh thought. It struck me, as I looked, how
sweet she would be tending invalids, how gentle,
how patient.
On her left sits the King. Oh ! a very fat man
indeed is the King, although he is not tall. He
doesn’t wear a crown. He is in evening-dress with
a white “button-hole.” The King has a wider face
than his portraits suggest, and his eyes are opened
wider ; he looks a most kindly, happy, contented,
merry, yet dignified old gentleman —every inch,
“Papa.”
After the first and second acts he rises.
He never says a word to the Queen, or his
daughters. He doesn’t tell them lie is going. He
just rises and quietly passes out of the box, and is
away all that interval and all the next, does not
return till the curtain has gone up. Then he
c unes in, opening the door gently. Entering the
box gently, moving with a cat-like, slow, fat
gentleman's grace. He immediately fixes his
g asses on the prettiest girl on the stage. While
1 1 e 3 is away, the Queen sits in her corner, his vacant
cn lir beside her. Neither of the Princesses move
up to talk to her. They sit and talk in a lifeless
way to each other. They are both white, ansemic-
looking young women, in cloudy black, with
white feather-boas.
Now and then the Queen turns her slight head
a little, and speaks to them. She somehow seems
to be acting as she does so. She looks so lovely,
so wistful, biting her red thin lips, as if to force a
smile that wished, of itself, to wane. There is
something queer about this conversation. After
a time it strikes me that the two white-faced
Princesses soarcely turn their heads to answer
that smiling, doll-like figure in the corner. She
speaks every now and then—a little quick, light
volley of words. Why do they not answer, come
oloser, and talk to her? Because that smiling,
graoef ul woman is stone-deaf. She does not hear
what they say. Her conversation is not intended
to be answered. She talks simply that the
audience will not see her sitting deaf and dumb.
Is it not pathetic ? She will not use an ear-
trumpet. She prefers to throw her little say out
into the air, and smile, and play her part.
Princess Charles is the better-looking of the
royal daughters ; but even she is not pretty. All
three ladies seem remarkably spiritless. There is
no gaiety in that box. All the sweetness of the
Queen, all the affable contentedness of the King,
do not rid the little party of a look of dulness.
Of course, nobody comes in to speak to them.
The orchestra plays "Yankee Doodle.” The
King drums on his shirt-front with his white kid
fingers. Then his hand goes creeping up to his
throat. Just for a second it hovers there. His
expression never changes. If he is suffering he is
a brave man. His'face shows nothing, beyond
the worn look of his eyes. Worry and ennui are
strangers to that face. But the eyes, good-
humored, twinkling eyes, have their worn look all
the same.
Then his hand goes down again. He takes his
opera glasses; he beats time on the front of the
box with them. He hammers out several bars of
that American air, looking round the house all the
time. He is for ever looking round. He looks as
if he wants to see there lots of people that he
knows, as if he likes the act of bowing and smiling,
and seeing smiles from familiar faces shot at him.
As the house is chiefly American there are not
many of his friends there. It is kept a secret
beforehand, a visit from Royalty. The “ Manage-
ment ” lets it out as much as possible. But
London is in a wild state of chasing from one
theatre to another just now, trying to be where
the King is, and generally missing him. There is
no method in his theatre-going. The first play he
visited, as King, was "Mice and Men,” played
by Forbes Robertson and Gertrude Elliott. That
was two weeks ago. Since then he has seen
“ Mademoiselle Mars ” as Mrs. Langtry (the
Queen did not go with him there ; she went later,
however, with the Princess of Wales), “ The
Toreador,” “Kitty Grey,” “Frocks and Frills,”
“Sherlock Holmes,” “The Importance of Being
Earnest,” and “ The Country Girl.”
Here comes someone London is raving over.
She is called “ The Funniest Woman in the
World.” She is American, was a chorus-girl,
Elfie Fay, but attracted the attention of the
house by her funny tricks. Now she drives
crowded houses at the Empire wild with laughter
at her antics as a Sousa Girl. Her facial expres-
sions are too ridiculous for words. Her dancing
is the sheer essence of absurdity and cleverness.
She is one of those very, very rare beings—a
humorous woman. A real American girl, copper
hair parted in the middle, and a bright, cute face,
and a cloak—a wonderful cloak —all lace and fur,
coming to her feet in a long yellow train.
In the lower box sits someone we all know—
Mrs Brown-Potter. She is with a clergyman
and his wife, and a very pretty young girl. She
has grown much stouter since we saw her last in
Sydney. Her face is quite round. I prefer it
with its delicate look. She wears an enormous
black bow in her hair, so big as to look like a
black cap, and keeps on her heavy sable cloak all
the time. At present, she is much talked of in
London. She threw up her part in “ Ulysses ”at
the last moment. Some say Mrs. Tree objected
to the way Calypso embraced Ulysses—Mr. Tree.
The other story is that Stephen Phillips inter-
fered too much. That is more probable. He is a
great poet, this dark, clean-shaven man with a
face like a bushman’s—and there is no great
actress in England at present except, maybe,
Mrs. Kendall.
The play draws near the end. The Queen
manoeuvres a grey feathery wrap round her
shoulders. The King keeps his glasses on pretty
little Olive May, the ingenue actress. He did not.
go out before the last act, but sat in the box, look-
ing just a little bored, just as any other stout old
amiable gentleman might look before the last act,
tired of sitting among his family on the edge of
his chair. The end of the play is in view. The
audience is not strictly conventional. Several
people rise and hurry away. The King does not
kill them with a glance ; he doesn’t even notice.
He watches the stage to the end, then the royal
party rise all together. There is no more bowing,
no more clapping. Quietly the door is opened,
the King goes out alongside the Queen, the white-
faced Princesses with the heavy sheepish eyes
follow. There is no “God Save the King ” from
the orchestra, and in a minute they are gone.
Will they laugh and talk when they get away
into their carriage? Let us hope so. For the
King’s sake, and especially for the Queen’s —the
deaf, sweet, plaintive, painted Queen.
LOUISE MACK.
On 31st January last there were in bond
in Scotland nearly 110,000,000 gallons of proof
whisky!—a quantity about equal to a week’s
water-supply for such a city as Sydney. Apropos,
along the Broomielaw (Glasgow) there is a public-
house to every 18 voters!
Captain Grosstnann, inventor of the water-
walking shoe, recently tramped the surface of the
Danube from Linz to Vienna—over 200 miles as
the river goes—towing his wife in a small boat.
Wearing these water-shoes—which are 15ft. long
—the in ventor lias already saved 21 persons from
drowning. Religious myth will soon not have a
"miracle” left that science can’t parallel in hard
fact.
One Thaise, a desperate robber and mur-
derer, was guillotined, the other day, in New
Caledonia:—
The condemned displayed the utmost calmness and in-
difference, refusing the services of a minister of religion.
He slept well the night before his execution, and in the
morning, stating he was hungry, was supplied with a
breakfast of sardines, chicken, and wine and rum, making
a hearty meal. Whilst the barber was, as usual, shaving
the back of his neck, Thaise talked in a familiar strain,
and, addressing the executioner, said, “ It is not because
your business is to cut off heads that you should not
drink a glass of wine with me,” and thereupon they
drank together. On the scaffold he admitted killing the
man, but said he had not intended doing so. An im-
proved guillotine was used on the occasion. After the
knife ha,d done its work the executioner, before throwing
the head into the basket, seized it with both hands by the
ears, and asked, “Thaise, do you hear me?” Two or
three movements of the jaws followed, from which it was
inferred that what had been said had been heard.
How very French it really all is !


“I Gained Flesh Rapidly."
If You Are Run Down, Losing Strength, Are Greatly
Debilitated, and Suffer from the Long, Hot Summer,
There is one Medicine That Will Quickly Cure You. It is
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
'x
f
Mr. A. Smith, of Chief Street, Brompton, So. Australia, very kindly sends us
the following letter with his photograph, both of which are given here.
“I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for loss of appetite, indigestion, and to give
tone and vigor to my system when training for bicycle racing. I only used three
bottles; but it was enough to improve my appetite and thoroughly restore my
strength and health. I also gained flesh rapidly to my normal weight.
“As a blood-purifier and general tonic for those who are affected by the'
long, hot summers of Australia there is no medicine like it.” •
It is because of such testimonials that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is called
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
We could show you hundreds of such letters as this. They all say that Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla helps every one who tries it. It always does good and sometimes
makes such wonderful cures that they seem lites miracles.
If you are feeling poorly just now, get a bottle of this grand old medicine.
The very next day you will feel better.
