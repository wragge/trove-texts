The Red Page
Lawson, Kendall and Burns
No matter how beautiful a soul is, if it
is put mto a shambling body to that extent
it shambles. If you are a writer and use
shambling words, you use shambling lines,
and your thought is that much the worse
in expression. In like manner, if you use
sauntering lines, you use for the most part
sauntering, long-syllabled words. So there
is value in form; the same value that there
is in exactness anywhere. In exact form
thought is forced to Express itself in words
of one key. And this elision of the hybrid
as well as of* the unlike gives permanence
to language, just as racial purity gives per-
manence to race.
Had Henry Lawson given study to form
he would have had the name yesterday, to-
day and to-morrow* that he will not have
till the see-saw of usage gives language,
slack to-day, that intensity which it seems
to take on when it is forgotten-of the every-
day tongue and used chiefly in script.
Chaucer probably \vrote as near to the
vulgar (using the word indts stricter sense)
as Lawsoji.* Then Time,, writing changes
on language, tiyew new reflections on, and
drew new lights from, what had probably
not had either; at least, not as modern
times apply them. I refer more to that
quality which, like the ineffable in beauty,
evokes feeling as much as it expresses mean-
ing. Not independent of meaning, it yet
gives something that mere meaning cannot
give.
In regard to strictness of form, it is the
forcing of a language to repeat the glamor
produced by the old—forcing it back to
stresses, syllabling, quantities and uses
gone by—that shears it of its redundance,
jts cheapness and its flabby growths, and
gives it a backbone and a place in perma-
nence. But here, again, only if not too
much driven, arid if not too far removed
from the national vulgate. Too much
straining means that what is done is lost
tor use, and has to be classed with the
experimental—which is only valuable as a
curiosity, for it no longer speaks the com-
mon tongue. The valu% of form, as implied
before, is that it compels the best use of
the- best words. Jt gives the diamond,
machine-polished, for to-day and .to-morrow ;
sometimes for longer.
Lawson, however, as to language, will lie
on many a forgotten beach of memory till
the waves of change and time have polished
him fine. He cannot be broken, he cannot
be lost, because' the undying, inward fire
is there ; its light can never fade out. Some
day, as for Chaucer, and even Burns, men
will come with lexicons and study; and in
the dz-ess of the newer-language of that day,
Lawson’s faulty stresses, his too obvious
rhymes; his unadulterated ordinariness of
wording will set new fashions, and men will
turn language back to write like him —as
we to-day turn back to those who, having
gone by, yet live because independently of
formal language the spirit burned. When
I think of the acclamations arid awards of
to-day I am sorry .Jb’at Lawson did not
study form. But when I think of tile future
and of what a find and a treasure of the
humble he will be. I think that it is well
that he lias so truly preserved our. speech
of. to-day in the manner of its common use.
We do not, as a people, pirouette on the
ladder of Italian sonnets and French posy
verse—forms that now and. then flit like
buttez-flies over pur soberer everyday garden,
even of verse. For to-da.v is stili the day
of the pioneer—even if the ehding
of the tongue of the pioneer. Ilis song* was
“Tile Wild Colonial Boy"; his speech that
of Lawson. “The Wild Colonial Boy” will
live; the most perfectly-fashioned sonnet will
not live longer for all its perfection and
polish ; for while the perfect in form is the
fountain in the park, or the result of a gar-
deners skill, “The Wild Colonial Boy,” is
the spring in the desert—the grass ‘of a
coolamon hole after rain. It is perennial;
where the formal is an annual kept alive
and nursed by literature, the other is kept
alive by the loves of the people. The
cheapest of words, it comes nearest to voic-
ing the inarticulate ; and the inarticulate is
the only undying fire.
And this brings me to another point. It
has been proposed to raise a memorial to
Kendall—a statue presumably—and to place
it opposite Burns in the. Domain. Burns
asks for Lawson. The greatest likeness
between Lawson and Burns is that their
humanity is full tide. The high tide of
Kendall is poetry. Facially there is no look
or Burns iii Kendall, but there is some look
of kinship in Lawson- that all the differences
cannot obliterate. And these likenesses and
have to be considered in
statuary. You do not belittle any man you
wish to honor by putting him where con-
trast makes clash. There is no clash be-
tween Burns and Larson. There can be
no clash between Lawson and Burns. The
masculinity of Lawson’s work matches that
of Bums; and in this the comparison of
likes is richer and more constructive than
the often merely instructive contrast of dif-
ference. I say nothing against a memorial
to Kendall. I am for it heart and soul.
Bat I do say that Lawson, should have the
place proposed for Kendall, and that the
tribute of a place reserved, in spite of our
indifference , to the living, is not too much
to give him even in his lifetime. Kendall
might well come next, and that walk to
the Gallery hecoine a tribute to writers as
the Gallery is the enduring tribute to our
painters and their kin in black and white.
MARY GILMORE.
The Bullionaires
Frobi Silver to Steel (Geo; Robertson and
Co.) is “the romance of the Broken Hill
Proprietary” told by Roy Bridges in a
volume as large and weighty as the Family
Bible. There was no lack of data for the
historian; for though the Barrier was so
remote from its capital—and, for that matter,
from every other capital—Wileannia was
handy, and Wilcannia was a place of
consequence in the early eighties. It
supported the Western Grazier, whose
editor was a youngster named Tom Heney,
presently to become editor of the S. M. Her-
ald ; and another of its printing presses was
owned by J'. S. Reid, who had done some
* pioneering on North Queensland mining
iields. That experience promptly decided
Reid on the discovery of silver on the
Barrier : he shifted camp to the new rush at
Silverton, and in the Silver age the new
held had a very excellent little sheet from
its earliest days. Later, when Rasp pegged
the first block at Broken. iliil, there was a
recorder handy, for in the first camp formed
on the mine the surveyor’s assistant happened
to be one W. R. Thomas, a family connection
of the Kyftin Thomases of the Adelaide Regis-
ter ; auu to that circumstance and to the very-
early local publication of• a directory and
handbook, Mr. Bridges seems to be indebted
for much of his history not only of the
earlier Silverton but also of the later Broken
llill. Thomas's little" collection of early-day
sketches was certainly worth an acknowledg-
ment. Still, Bridges’s account, even of those
earliest days, has a separate value; it is
doubtuil whether, for instance, so complete a
story has hitherto been printed of the move-
ments of the Original shares of the Broken
Hill Syndicate.
Produced under the patronage of the com-
pany, it would be Too much to expect tiiat we
should rind here any serious criticism of any-
thing the co. has ever done. It wouid be
too much' perhaps to expect that we should
even, have a hint that m. those early days
of •prospecting on the Barrier- the Squatters
who were afterwards to.be so amazingly
enriched should have had no very kindly
feelings for a race of people who were so
careless about gates and had so little regard
-—some of them- —lor tne sanctity of wire
fences. Yet it is a pity : hat the historian
was not able, after the lapse cf nearly dO
years, to present something less lopsided a
view of some of the earlier events in the
company’s history. There is, for example, a
chapter on the “great strike” of 1892 which
any future historian, aiming at an impartial
survey, will be well advised to regard merely
as the presentation of one side of the case.
Than this strike, no better illustration could
be found of the change which has occurred
in the social and industrial life of the country
within 80 years. As an outcome of an earlier
and brief trouble the Miners’ Association had
got the company to agree to settle all future
disputes by the process df- arbitration, till
then almost unheard of in this connection.
The miners’ union, trusting to this agree-
ment, shed its militancy. Every worker on
the mine was de faoto a member of the union,
and thus,bound by its agreement. Many of
them were probably very poor unionists; for
propaganda was practically dead, being, as it
was thought, unnecessary. Sudde'nly a demand
for altered conditions was made by the
companies. The miners pointed to the
agreement: this was a matter for the arbitra-
tion they had mutually adopted. The com-
panies’ reply was to tear up the scrap of
paper. In the long strike—or it may be
lockout—that followed the miners were
beaten thoroughly. “The mine-owners’ vic-
tory,” Mr. Bridges concludes his chapter,
“resulted in several years of industrial peace
on the Barrier.” What it actually resulted
in was a bitterness never before known—a
bitterness that has lasted to this moment: a
contempt for arbitration; and that bitterness
and contempt in conjunction have just borne
fruit in a strike that has lasted 18 months.
The wrong people went to gaol in 1892.
In following the progress of Broken Hill
Mr. Bridges keeps his eye only on the B. H,
Proprietary Co.; and for that reason the
story of the development of the- sulphide .pro-
cesses is imperfect. As a matter of fact,
in spite of its tremendous services to Aus-
tralia, the Broken Hill Proprietary did less
than might reasonably have been expected
of it in experimental work upon sulphide
ores. It was not driven by the necessity
which compelled the Broken Hill South, for
instance, to Tackle problems that had not
been solved in tne laboratory to anybody’s
satisfaction. In that conn-action no history
of Broken Hill —as distinguished from a his-
tory of the Broken Hill Proprietary—can
be, complete unless a .warm tribute is paid
to T. J. Greenway. Nor, in relation to the
subsequent saving of the zinc, can any
record be complete unless it throws a bou-
quet at the Sulphide Corporation. But
when we come to tfie development of the
iron and steel industry the Broken Hill
Prop, carries off all the credit; and even
this volume, generous of its praise, gives
less than is due to one man, and that man
G. D. Delprat, the general manager. That
the directors have stood behind him goes
without saying: . the tremendous things that
the company has dope at Newcastle would
have been impossible, otherwise. But with-
out th.e long views of G. D. Delprat, these
things would certainly not have been at-
tempted ; and without the support of F. M.
Dickenson, the • secretary, the long views
could not have been translated so swiftly
into action. •
In large matters Mr. Bridges’s Volume
is, within the limitations already referred
teg generally admirable. In small matters
there are errors which one does not like to
meet in a book of reference. Thus Mr.
Bridges has a sly dig at that good old chief
inspector of mines who was beaten by
“Umberumberka” —one of the first sections
of the Baryier field to be worked. But “Tar-
rawingee” beats Mr. Bridges. And while he
finds a beam in the eye of the old stone-
mason Avho supplied a' c too many to the
inscription on Poole’s grave, a mote in his
own allows • him to give an e to ~W. A.
Horn, one of the provisional directors named
in the original*prospectus of the company.

KODAK, for Christmas
There are people who
wander aimlessly from
store to store in a vain
attempt to find some-
thing that will suggest it-
self as the Christmas Gift
worth while. They peer
into the brilliant shop
windows and scan the
show-cases and bother
the salesfolk. Sometimes
their search is successful,
sometimes it is fruitless.
In either case success or
failure is paid for in
terms of tired feet and
mental worry.
There are people like that.

And then, in happy contrast, there is the Kodak amateur. He
does not pursue a random way through this store or that. He
knows from experience the fun in photography and the pleasure
o pictures. He knows that a Kodak is a gift whose charm
the years only emphasise.
And so when he comes to a person on his gift list whom he
wants to be sure to please, he just puts on his hat and coat and
strolls down to his Kodak dealer’s. He knows that what he
wants is there.
Kodak took the bother out of photography years ago; it will
take the bother out of Christmas as well.

Narrabeen.
Ou earth there is no blither scene,
This much I vow and swear,
Than one may see at Narrabeen,
When picnic-folk with eyes aglow
Put by their household cares and go
A-liolidaying there.
The trees no longer seem of wood
Fast-rooted in the earth,
So much they enter in the mood
Of man and maid no longer pent
In narrow walls, but free to vent
Their souls in wholesome mirth.
Through steadfast gum and stately palin,
And saplings, slim and coy,
And she-oaks silent in the calm,
A quickening spirit seems to move
And thrill their leaves as though to prove
All life responds to joy.
The lit lake, like a silver shield —
A sight to see and love —
Lies broad and calm, while far afield
And near at hand the mullet leap
In glittering shoals, and gannets sweep
On slanting wings above.
By shoreside groves and gleaming glades
The. lake-boats' dance and glide,
The rowel's plying leisured blades
That flash the’ sunlight back again,
While singing girls and .sunbrowned men
Are mirrored in the tide.
By creek and cove red eampiires burn,
While round them festive folk
Lie stretched at ease ’mid flower and fern
’Neath slender palm-trees; green and tall,
With, back of them, a living wall
Of ti-tree, gum and "oak.
Now flutes a butcher-bird, and now
A kookaburra calls,
And now, o’er lake and leaf and bough.
There moves a soft and scented breeze
That stirs the happy, musing trees
In their enchanted halls.
Now sinks the sun, and far and wide
The last rich lights are thrown;
Home speeding on the glowing tide,
The boats dance down a rosy wake,
And leave the drowsy, dreaming lake
To Beauty’s self alone.

She, dear Sly one, will deny him not.
Ah, who is happier in the wide green land?
See, through the arehbd bough the distant
meadow,
Where summer clouds make patterns on
the grass,
And children dance betwixt the sun and
shadow.
On drowsy feet, then let the long day pass.
Sweet is the sound where the green branches
cover
The blackbird in his mirthful carolling;
Sweet is the scent of primrose and of
mosses
Where lies the panting lover—
Sweeter her voice than any birds that sing.
Fragrant as flowers the little curls she tosses.
Fled are the fauns and long dead are the
dryads,
But yet the wood has gods as fair as these
Where swift and straight, and white as
ancient naiads,
Boys through the brown pool gleam be-
neath the trees ;
And where the peasant, sun-awaked to
passion,
Careless of corn, deserts the sleepy farm.
Follows his Phyllis to the sheltered stream.
And there in godlike fashion
Soothes all her sorrow —shall she come to
harm
If on his breast she stay awhile, and dream?
Where the white foxgloves grow below the
garden
Here I await her lovelier than all,
Fearful that yet her little heart may harden
Ere the soft primrose robe of evening fall.
She far too tender for the hot sun’s burning,
She far too timid for the light of day,
Silver, will come to me beneath the moon;
Then I, swiftly turning.
Shall hold her and hold her —ah, who shall
say
How I shall take her? Ah, sweet, come
soon !
On a dim bank of dew-bestarred flowers
White she will breathe beside me in the
gloom :
Cool are her kisses in the crystal hours
Ere nales the dawning when the grey trees
loom ;
Kinder her touch than leaves that are rain-
parted,
Softer her sigh than stir of linnet's wings—
Will she not hasten, lest I lonely lie
And. waiting empty-hearted,
Curse tree and flower, and nightingale that
sings ?
Ah. will she not then hasten lest I die?
VICTORIA.

IT is seldom that one can make a gift
which is at once beautiful and useful.
COMMUNITY PLATE (Knives,
Forks, Spoons) provides this opportunity.
Of its beauty there can be no doubt. The illus-
tration will give you an immediate appreciation of
the elegance of the designs and the rich decoration
of the period styles. This first impression will be
intensified by an inspection of the articles themselves.
The service of COMMUNITY PLATE (Knives,
Forks, Spoons) is guaranteed for thrice-daily use
for Fifty Years. The pieces are heavily plated
over all, and are scientifically reinforced hy means
of visible discs of pure silver, where wear is
severest.
Besides the two patterns, illustrated above, two
more, in the style of Adam or Hep pie white, are
available, IN SINGLE PIECES OR WHOLE
SERVICES.
A gift of half-a-dozen pieces of COMMUNITY PLATE (Knives, Forks, Spoons)
makes an excellent beginning for a complete service. The patterns are exclusive
and are never duplicated in goods of different price or different quality. The
first possession can be added to, piecemeal, until the whole service is acquired.

WHAT IS THIS DECENTRALISATION?
The recent Nationalist Conference decided
that “Decentralisation” should remain at its
old post on the N. S. Wales State programme.
It is a survival, like “loyalty to the Throne
and Person” or the buttons on the rear of a
tail coat; a harmless pleasant custom like
the cross at the entrance to an Italian
village; a peaceful but fixed habit like the
tattooing on a Dyak baby’s stomach, which
means nothing but amuses the baby. In
addition it is a benefit theoretically yearned
after, as a stout, prosperous London-born
Hebrew, who never took the trouble to go
100 miles from his birthplace, theoretically
and formally yearned until the other day
for a restored Commonwealth of Zion, so that
he might return to the land that he neve.'
saw and bound like a hart beside the brook
Jabbok. But all this stereotyped matter-of-
courseness doesn’t alter the fact that it has
hitherto proved impossible to get a definition
of the blessing that every party in almost
every State promises every time it gets the
chance. As for supplying a sample to go by,
which is much better than any wordy
explanation, that is undreamt of. The pro-
posal of the Grafton-Armidale district to
build a specimen of decentralisation between
Brisbane and Sydney aroused the decentral-
isers to fury, and Minister Estell bellowed
like an enraged and bloodshot Caesar who
saw insurrection brewing and treason in
the process of distillation.
The matter may be put in these questions :
Is it proposed to decentralise the control of rail-
ways, both management and construction (the
former isn’t worth a Bolshevik note without the
latter), and to do it in reality —not merely to
appoint local managers, v-ho are just glorified station-
masters, u::der the old boss-manager in the old
boss-place ?
Is it proposed to decentralise control of the public
lands in reality—not merely to send out a few higher-
salaried land-agents with bigger names and bigger
districts to control, while keeping every particle
of the supreme authority in the ancient office at
the ancient spot ?
Js it proposed to decentralise the power which
makes (or consistently refuses to make) and equips
and manages new ports and attends to the building
of new towns'?
And if it isn’t proposed to permanently and defi-
nitely part with any bit of the old centralised
authority, then what in the name of wonder is to
be decentralised ?
Control of railways, public lands and ports
are the first essentials, but many other tilings
attach to them or follow them. And as the
new powers can t be held by hereditary
autocrats, the men who exercise them
must be responsible to new local legislative
authorities. To make them responsible to
the old ones would undo everything and put
things back where they were, or, rather, they
would have remained where they were all fhe
time. If any political party of‘all those that
ha\e decentralisation on the programme has
a scheme lor subdividing the present concen-
trated power without parting with any of
the power, then the hidden thing should be
revealed. Also it should be shown that anv
clumsy and complicated compromise which
mav be suggested is worth while when the
process of subdivision is so easy and obvious
and has scored so many successes.
* * * •
British Isles are between one-third and
one-half the size of Australia’s Ma State.
±liey have no decentralisation problem as
legal els public lands, for there are none
worth As regards railway con-
V.°h “ e . United Kingdom outside London is
divided into about 82 independent States—
-1 ndepend ent in the sense of being autonomous
within the Empire, just as N. S. Wales is
and as N. S. Wales’s new Northern State in-
tends to be. These States are of wonderful
and complicated shapes, with capitals scat-
tered all over the place, from Cork and Car-
clift and btratforcl-on-Avon to Inverness. At
each capital sits the elected Government.
i ritish railways are not mixed up
with the land and school and police authority,
the railway States don’t correspond with the
administrative ones any more than the six
subdivisions of Australia which borrow and
ani * .Billingsgate correspond with the
rm' 1 p n j V lstj 'icts or the Church dioceses.
I hat tact rather increases the measure of
decentralisation. British control of ports
and harbors is as local and complete as the
central authority, always anxious to unload
its burdens, can make it. As regards the
creation of new towns and ports, any person
or association with the money and inclina-
tion can make such things if he or it can
tind a vacant allotment, and he or it can
get the new place railroaded without diffi-
culty. In England the half-hundred admin-
istrative counties have powers almost
co-ordinate with those of Australian States,
barring the fact that the railways are de-
centralised otherwise. When the hereditary
peerage and beerage ceases to legislate, it is
quite possible, that the self-governing coun-
ties and big municipal States will supply
senators (one or two apiece) to a new
Upper House, and then the Federal idea will
be complete. The U.S.A. is similarly divided
into small administrative States, with much
the same authority as Victoria or Queensland
possesses, and into railway States {there are
8(5 important ones), with capitals of thei ■
own. In fact, the efforts of big political
men to part with details of authority are as
remarkable as those of petty men to hang on
to them.
*• * a
There is nothing in these or any other
known examples to show how a country can
be decentralised without the old Centralisa-
tion giving up something, and giving it up
irrevocably. If any National or other party,
in the Ma State especially, knows how to
manage this it had better produce its plan
~ not its platitudes—quickly. Eor Sydney
is liable to be a Boisoned City any summer
for 10 summers to come, since, according
to the Premier, it will take that time to
complete the new water scheme. For this
evil, present and in prospect, responsible
people—responsible by omission or commis-
sion, by selfishness, vanity or neglect—may
get the surprise of their lives immediately
after death. Bishops and parsons, however
much they may sympathise over 6 x 8 back-
yards, and houses packed with humanity like
sardines, may be damned because of it.
Christians, though they contribute largely
to the Sabbath-collection, may fry because
of it. By reason of it Millions' Clubbers
may sleep six together on a grid for billions
of ages, and politicians who talked but didn’t
act may boil separately. And aldermen run
the risk of—but, after all, it doesn’t much
matter what happens to aldermen. At the be-
ginning of December the city reservoirs were
running very low, and the influx of water
was less than the outgo. In five years 716
miles of new water-main have been laid,
but as everything has been done, and is
being done, to centralise population in the
city the demand has left them far behind.
In any case, even if 7160 miles of new main
were laid a huge new tunnel which no one
quite knows how to pay for is required to
feed them, and then there is the frequent
lack of water to fill the tunnel. Australia,
with its unreliable rainfall and great loss
by evaporation, with a population that likes
to wash often and a climate that incites to
the washing habit, is a poor place for big
cities, especially big. casual, ill-built cities
which must either wash or fester. In this
country outside the tropics a place with
200.000 population may have to go as far
afield for a drinkable supply as one of
2,000,000 or even 4.000.000 in some other
lands; wherefore the expense is huge, or
else the famine is periodical. When Ivnibbs
compiled (for his Year Book No. 2) . a list
of rivers ranging down to three miles in
length—for it doesn’t do to miss a river
where they are so scarce—he found 18
worth enumerating, with 26 tributaries
attached, along the N. S. Wales east coast.
Of these 12 rivers and 24 tributaries lie
north of the city : and very much of what
Australia calls “river” is undrinkable 1 ':
estuary, and a great deal more is sometimes
tr : ckle and sometimes sand. Leaving out
so-called rivers that flow inland when they
flow at all, and become salt a'hd perish in
the Dry Dead Sea of the interior, Australia
has only 11 streams (the Murray-Darling
combination being reckoned as a single insti-
tution) outside the tropical section to equal
the Shannon in the scuth-west of little Ire-
land, and many of them are lacking in depth
and turn briny a long way up in drought-
time. In a region like that a city of a
million people is certain to be a very costly
problem: one of two millions may be a
calamity, and one of three millions a
tragedy inasmuch as it may pass out one
dry day from thirst as other places have by
earthquake. Nothing of the size has been
tided before, so far as evidence goes, in a
country which wears our size in droughts.
Honest decentralisation would give us an-
other few centuries for thought before we
bring up against even the million-city pro-
blem.
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR
BARONS?
The schoolchild is usually scandalised to
learn of the inequitable ways of the mediae-
val barons. It seems incredible in these
enlightened times, with policemen and fac-
tory-inspectors and weekly Royal Commis-
sions and triennial Parliaments and univer-
sal adult sun.rage and all the rest, that
things should have been so different a tew
centuries back. What an engine for oppres-
sion and illegality a really low-class castle
must have been! The child visualises it
beetling grimly down from its crags upon the
serfs below. The latter toil in the tie.ds
from daylight to dark or sit in their towns
making weapons, articles of clothing and
other necessaries with a sort of dull energy.
In the great building close by are those
who batten on them. These persons do
1-ttle or nothing of a useful nature, deriving
all they require under a pro rata system of
compulsory contributions from the real
workers. Whenever the baron and his fol-
lowers, whether owing to incompetence or
extravagance, find themselves in financial
difficulties they execute a foray. The right-
minded child grows hot with anger at the
thought of these blundering tyrants sending
their emissaries out to collect the property
of others under threats of imprisonment.
The serfs are required to do more than pay
up: they must look pleasant as well. Lcse-
majeste, or, as we should say, disloyal utter-
ances, gre forbidden whether in respect of
the resident baron’s performances or those
of his friends in other parts of the world,
for freedom of speech, our most cherished
possession, has yet to be born. Such are
the lessons the Australian child is taught
in his history classes. He is rarely in-
structed in the much more important truth
that relatively things are much the same
at the present moment. When Bulweb-
Lytton wrote “The Last of the Barons” he,
in a manner of speaking, lied. The barons
have been with us ever since 1914. Every
Parliament is a castle, and every executive
chief a tyrant with a rapacious band of col-
leagues and thousands of loafing retainers
who carry out their superiors’ orders for a
living. The very complexity of our civilisa-
tion makes the work of domination easier.
In the Middle Ages people lived near rivers
or springs. Their health and comfort had
nothing to do with the energy or capacity
of a water and sewerage board. They did
not depend greatly on transport; they knew
nothing of post and telegraph services, and
they got along without telephones. It
makes things no better for us that the
modern aristocrat wears a felt hat in place
of a vizor, carries a stick instead of a
sword, and is called by an official’s and not
a nobleman’s title. The change of style and
costume does not prevent him from provok-
ing needless wars; conducting them ineffi-
ciently, with the result that countless lives
and immense sums of money are wasted;
punishing hostile comment on his ineptitudes
as .treason; and taking payment for his
activities by force. The sums which the
h ederal and N. S. Wales Governments have
just taken for members of Parliament out
of the public’s pocket represent the proceeds
of raids as much as any personality lifted
in a Rhine bank foray 590 years ago.
What is the struggle which is going on
all over the civilised world at the present
time but a blind effort to get as far away
from this sort of thing as possible? The
great mass of the electors want more free-
dom than they possess at present, not be-'
cause they wish to indulge in license, but
because. they feel that, given genuine free-
dom, injustices and even grave dangers may
be averted. Many of them learnt the value
of this great gift for the first time during
the past six years—an epoch in which some
had to sacrifice all their freedom and all
had to sacrifice some of it. Before the war
the advance guard of democracy, the people
whom papers like the S. M. Herald and
the Argus warned their readers against,
argued that the remedy was more State
Socialism—“the nationalisation of the means
of production, distribution and exchange.”
Suddenly without a word of warning their
ambitions were gratified. Everything was
nationalised. The State took over trans-
port, food and practically all the necessaries
of life. The very press was nationalised
inasmuch as it was only allowed to publish
what the nation- —as the political party
which happened to be in power at the time
called itself —considered expedient. The
Conservatives who had been denouncing
anti-Socialism ever since G. H. Reid made
it a political issue in 1907 found to their
astonishment that it was the very article
they had always needed. Those rich men
or influential bureaucrats who desired to
wear uniforms had no difficulty in getting
billets which combined complete safety with
considerable honor and profit as press cen-
sors, C.O. troops on transports, camp com-
mandants and so forth; thousands of new
and lucrative civilian billets became avail-
able ; unimagined opportunities for making
large fortunes offered themselves; and the
insurgent worker was dealt with very much
as in the days when the Combination Laws
were passed. The Socialists who had voted
against Reid were not long in discovering
their mistake. W. M. Hughes, having got
rid of his amiable chief, -Andrew Fisher,
propounded his formula. The Empire being
at war. ard '-e t H t ghes, being the head of
one of the Empire’s Governments, anyone
who questioned the wisdom of his executive
acts was a traitor to King and country
Backed by a servile Parliamentary majority
a pliant press and a disciplined body of
police, civil and military it „ r
matter to enforce this theory. Most of £
States imitated his vigorous example He
is still ruling on these Early German lines
and so are they. The Royal prerogative
which novv resides with executives has not
been used to such purpose since the head o
England’s Martyr King fell before an unap-
preciative crowd at W hitehall.
It is an astonishing fact that a muddle-
headed type ot worker is clamoring for more
of this 1* eudal brand of administration. He
isn t such a fool as to believe that exnro-
pnation will enrich him personally, nor to
do him justice, is lie so dishonest as to wish
to benefit by such means; but he is obsessed
bj a fallacy which is first cousin to the ones
he saw r through in the first six months of the
voir. The idea is that anarchy, followed hv
communism, will give birth to true liberty,
due fact is, if W. M. Hughes did
not, like Gibbon, know himself to be
the suit of man whom revolutionaries
destroy, and if- our bourgeois were
not reluctant to face the inevitable pre-
limiliary assault on themselves and their pro-
p< rty, they and their like would be the loudest
communists in the Commonwealth. For com-
munism offers their sort chances that no
other system does. What is it, after all but
militarism applied to civil life? Men are
conscripted to work instead of to fight: th-y
have to be. in fairness to the rest of the com-
munity. The striker is a deserter, and there
are circumstances under which lie may be a
traitoi or a spy. Plainly, where all the means
of production and exchange are doled out by
the State, the State’s pow'er must be of the
most absolute character. What is the State
under such conditions V Stripped of legal
fiction it is simply a vehement careerist of
the Hughes type, with a claque of some
thousands of office-men —few, if any, of whom
belong to the proletariat, because the pro-
letariat rarely evolves that sort of man --
and as a back.ng a powerful armed force
paid with the money of those whom it keeps
in subjection. The present state of things is
admittedly intolerable. But that is only be-
cause the Commonwealth has been ' first
tricked and then flouted by an exceptionally
unscrupulous politician. He got his majority
on the understanding, chiefly, that the people
would be handed back the liberties which
were taken from them wffiile the fighting was
on, as soon as possible. That promise and
many others have been broken. However, the
time is not far distant when he and his
accomplices can be punished ; and there is no
doubt that, when the electors next get a
chance to express their sentiments on the
salary increases, the perpetuation of govern-
ment by regulation arid other matters, those
guilty will be punished. Had the recall been
in operation the offenders could have been
disciplined on the spot; under an elective
Ministry system the offences would probably
never have been even attempted. In short,
our present troubles are due to an abnormal
character exploiting abnormal times, and even
at that they are essentially curable. The
communist alternative is to make Hughes
or someone like him a permanent feature of
the Constitution; to supersede the English
common law and all our industrial legislation
by a measure on the lines of the War Pre-
cautions Act (which is martial law' pure and
simple) : and to provide no means of escape
in the likely event of the new' arrangement
proving unsatisfactory. It is like committing
hari-kari to cure an attack of indigestion.
UP BY THE FITZROY RIVER.
The United States selected Washington as
its capital for various reasons. The place
was central, the republic being then a mere
coastal strip like Chili. It had not a single
inland province, and no assured prospect of
getting any, as great European Powers
hemmed it in. Maine was then Uncle
Sam’s furthest north (it was part of Massa-
chusetts, but was presently severed because
the country hated big States), and Georgia
his furthest south. Washington’s other
advantages were that it was as far as could
be got, without impairing the central prin-
ciple, from the trio of imposing cities, New
York, Philadelphia and Boston, and wouldn’t
be a suburb of any of tnem; also the Fed-
eral territory was on the border line of two
States, and had its own river outlet. A
year after it was founded Virginia, the over-
shadowing adjacent State, was cut in two
to make it less overshadowing. The idea
of a Federal capital put on a peninsula
down in a corner, for the express purpose
that it should be surrounded by the terri-
tory of the most populous, arrogant and
least Federal of the States —that it should
be wholly dependent on it for permission
for its people to come and go, and should
be a mere appanage of its big city—would
have struck these U.S. Constitution-makers
with wonder, it being contrary to every one
of their ideas. And the grudging concession
of 18,000 acres 140 miles distant to make
a “port” would have seemed to them a very
poor joke.
If the United States was built on Aus-
tralian lines it would have seven capitals—
six State and one national —and most of
them would be in Florida.
The Canadian Dominion made its metro-
polis (Ottawa) as central as it possibly
could without going up into the eternal frost.
Ottawa stood on the border line of the two
big States so as to be shut in and controlled
by neither; and it had its own navigable
river outlet. If the Red River (Manitoba)
and beyond had belonged in those days, the
Dominion Parliament might have been still
further out. But Canada, like the U.S.
and unlike Australia, wasn’t born full-
grown. Ours is the only one of the three
that went lopsided through pure anti-Fed-
eral and anti-national selfishness.
When the nine little States of Maoriland
unified the seat of the Government was
promptly removed from Auckland, the
greatest town, to a central position at Wel-
lington. No province was allowed to say
that the capital was its chattel or oerquisite.
There, as in Canada and the U.S., none
was mean enough to bargain for it as the
price of adhesion.
Argentina and Brazil had their
coastal capitals decided for them by old kings


before Federation was known. But Brazil
is shifting to a new metropolis in the mid-
land State of Goyaz. Goyaz, having only
one-sixtieth of the republic’s population, had
no clamorous and assertive voice in the
matter. It was simply that the old capital
was willing to resign for the public good,
and the two overwhelmingly populous States
d-dn’t put in a claim.
When the first selection of an Austra-
lian Federal site was made on Monaro
it at least complied with the condition that
the place should be in the Ma State. That
condition, along with the one which pro-
hibits the formation of the New State in
Northern N. S. Wales, was smuggled in
contrary to the decision of the people’s
elected Constitution-makers. The first capi-
tal had the drawback of being down in a
corner. But it had advantages inasmuch
as it had an outlet to two States, it had a
prospect of possessing its own harbor, and
being half-way between two big cities_ and
a long way from either it could develop inde-
pendently. Also, it had cheap and abundant
water-power, so that it could manufacture
for itself. For these very advantages the
parochialists and anti-Federalists and their
Big City press conspired to kill it.- Being
un-Australian and unpatriotic, they wanted
a suburban political town of an unworthy
sort with their own local kith and kin keep-
ing the keys and ruling the comings and
goings of the inhabitants. In fact, they
were everything that all the big nation-
builders have striven for the sake of their
good name not to be. ....
Owing to misfortune it is difficult to find
a possible and really central site in Australia.
If the area with less than lOin. of annual
rain and with 12ft. of evaporation is blotted
off the map, this'continent is a huge cres-
cent. The Macdonnell Ranges, which
were once talked of, especially by The
Bulletin, as a capital site of promise, repre-
sent a sort of cape or promontory of fer-
tility. But the South to North railway
isn’t built, the Ranges are still inaccessible,
and in the North time is pressing. The
country on which we have undertaken to
demonstrate, against the opinion of the
world, that white tropical settlement- is
possible, is now fast losing population ow.ng
to incompetent government by remote ex-
perimentalists down south. No State has
been formed there because we profess, in
deed if not in words, that the place is unfit.
No centre of Government within. No
State capital is found within 350 miles of
the southern fringe of the vast province
because the white politician allegedly can t
support life there. The next capital is
about 1000 miles away. Unless formal and
definite and resolute possession is taken,
White Australia may end in a very few
years, and end with very few friends.
So there is something to be said for a
Federal capital somewhere about the Fitzroy
River. It would be much nearer the centre
of habitable Australia than Canberra is. It
would be as near to half-way up the map as
is compatible with the necessity for taking
formal military possession of tropical Aus-
tralia bv moving the military headquarters
there. There is no need for the Government
to officially garrison the South by way of
affirming that that is white man s country, tor
no one disputesAhe fact. But there is need
to politically garrison the North, winch eveiy-
body save ourselves declares to be naturally
Brown. The new capital would populate the
North at least to the extent of bring-
ing a horde of officials and their de-
pendants there. And its establishment
would force the subdivision of Queensland,
which is an urgent matter, because the
Federal capital would naturally be on a
border line like Washington and Ottawa,
and not live in a chronic condition of s.ege
with one big subject commanding every exit
and entrance. There is at least one large
patriotic all-Australian reason for a capital
on the Fitzroy, while there was none for a
capital on the Cotter, save that imaginary
Sydney interests demanded it. If Queens-
land had the sense to break itself into three
States, which it could fairly do on a popula-
tion basis, and its present area had in conse-
quence 18 Senators and 16 or 17 Representa-
tives. it would be in a position to debate
this and other points. The Big State policy
is costly for Queensland.
The people of the New State m northern
N S Wales have an interest in this mat-
ter. The district north of Sydney is two-
thirds, or more like three-fourths, of the Ala
State, and places like Armidale, Glen Innes,
Tenterfield and Inverell are as well qualified
to be the Federal capital under the law as
Canberra. They never got any more chance
than if they were Timbuctoo._ This /was
partlv because a capital at that distance nom
Sydney would have a chance to develop a
life and independence of its own; partly
because the alternative outlet to Brisbane
would prevent its trade being a purely
Sydney perquisite; and partly because, it
planted very far north, the capital might
secure a frontage to Queensland and have
the run of two States, as Washington has.
Now the people of quite a fair section of
the New State would find a Federal capital
on the Fitzroy nearer to them in a straight
line, and nearer by any probable railway
route than one on the Cottei. Also it might
be more independent and sympathetic than a
place under the political and moral domina-
tion of their old friends at Sydney. In
anv case, the North ought to Look North.
Looking back at the old haunts was the
ruin of Lot’s best "irl. _

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Need for July Budgets.
One of the things that are white-anting
Parliamentary government in Australia is
the rapid disappearance of Parliamentary
control of the public purse. It is practically
the most important of Parliament’s functions,
but most of the Australian legislatures have
all but abandoned it. To secure this funda-
mental of ordered liberty multitudes of men
have perished, but the right won from the
kings of the past has been ignobly sur-
rendered to the petty tyrants of the present,
—the appearance of Parliamentary control
still exists, but the authority of the executive
is absolute. Except when they are ram n
their own salaries or rolling some local log
the mass of Australian legislators exhibit no
interest in the disbursement of the public
revenues. Tlie annual Estimates are drawn
up uy neads of departments —eacn concerned
to secure the biggest possible appropriat.on
for his own section of the bureaucracy —and
“revised,” after a fashion, by the Treasurer,
if he isn’t too tired, or by the Under-
Treasurer if the Minister is incapable, as .s
often the case. In this form they are intro-
duced into Parliament, not at the beginning
of the session, when business is slack and
there would be plenty of time for proper con-
sideration, but towards the end. The \ ic-
torian Budget, for instance, was delayed
until November 30, and the Queensland load
of trouble didn’t arrive till December 1. In
other words, Parliament is not permitted to
approve of the Government’s financial
arrangements until nearly half the money
budgeted for has been spent. By that time
honorable members are more intent on get-
ting home for the Christmas holidays or the
Christmas horse-races than on seeing that the
public funds are expended w r ith due regard
for the necessities of the State. So, with the
approval of all parties, all-night sittings are
instituted, the Estimates are shoved through
in a block or with the merest pretence of dis-
cussion, by a handful of weary Titans (the
spelling varies), a Loan Bill and several
railway proposals are enacted on day,
the Premier (or it may be the Speaker)
shouts for all hands, and Parliament, its
year’s “work” done, fades far away, dissolves
and forgets everything except the salary, not
to reassemble until June or July. This is
what happens every year in pretty well
every State. The Commonwealth Parliament
has a rather better record, but even the
Commonwealth Parliament is not exempt
from the political crime of belated Budgets,
overloaded Estimates and three-in-the-morn-
ing “deliberations” that are a libel on the word.
It also must be held guilty, along with the
still more culpable State tribulations, of
regarding the Budget as a public nuisance
which it is imperative to get rid of before
Christmas by a hell-for-leather end-of-the-
session rush. This attitude is partly respon-
sible for the ruinous extravagance that has
distinguished latter-day Australian finance,
and before there can be any honest attempt
at reform it will need to be knocked on the
head. Parliament will have to resume its
function of guarding the people’s money if
the old conception of Parliamentary govern-
ment is to endure. No country can afford
to have its expenditure decided for all time
by a Treasurer and three or four heads of
departments; that way lies corruption, or
insolvency, or worse. Consideration of the
Estimates should be the first business of the
session, not the last, and it should be a real
job, not a tedious or farcical formality. Seeing
that the financial year ends in June the
financial statement ought to be ready in
July, which would give members ample time
to digest it and suggest amendments. With
July Budgets Parliament would have no
shred of justification' for loafing, as it does
now, in the early part of the session, and
disgracefully scamping its work in the last
month ; there would then be some order and
arrangement about the public business, which
at present is without form and void. There
can be no excuse for the lazy, incompetent
Treasurer who brings down a November or
December Budget. He should be disqualified
for 25 years.
The Medicinal Aspect of a Railway.
A marvellous little rich-pauper city is Dar-
win, where “advanced” or . non-work.ng
Labor has taken command, and the laws
make themselves, and free speech is off, and
the doctrine that loafing is the supreme
good rages exceedingly. The great meat-
works, representing a million of outside capi-
tal, were closed after two or three tempestu-
ous years, and the big ships were mostly
scared away by the incessant strikes and
hold-ups of people with whom the making
of terms is impossible because their word is
no more binding than an Afghan’s oath.
There is a petty Government vessel which
carries cargo from Darwin to outside places.
Lately it cost £35 (nearly id. per lb.) and
a whole day to load nine tons on this craft
at Darwin, though a few niggers unloaded it
at the other end in 2i hours. The voyage
cost £164 and tne receipts were £24, and the
difference of £l4O was paid by persons in the
other States. If the trade grew to equal
that of even a place like Townsville, and
the loafers of Darwin still loafed, the cost
would ruin the other States. Now a move-
ment is on foot to starve the local paper
off the premises for being insufficiently posi-
tive that these are the best of all possible
conditions. Yet there is nothing hopeless
about Darwin. It is only mad, and it is
isolated save for a precarious connection
with Bolshevik-haunted Queensland, which
makes it madder. It wants a constant com-
ing and going of ordinary sane people to
rouse its handful of mixed crazed folk from
their self-absorption and self-admiration.
Bv far the nearest big city to Dar-
win is Adelaide, which is a level-headed
place. Perth is the next nearest, but
Perth has no influence and leads nowhere.
Sydney and Melbourne are distant and about
equi-distant. Brisbane is much further re-
moved than Adelaide, and is the one place
that no lunatic town should be connected
with, being rather crazed itself. The line
from Adelaide for rather Port Augusta)
would be far the shortest one possible. It
would be a transcontinental line cutting off
great distances, while all others proposed are
more coastal, and are long and crooked. A
°reat part of the work is already built. The
Commonwealth is pledged to its completion:
further it received 523,620 square miles of
territory (in which it has played the giddy
ox till 'the place is almost ruined) in con-
sider&tion of completing the and
it can’t break or vary the bargain without
being a swindler. The Hughes Govern-
ment proposes to build a few more miles ot
the unfinished transcontinental at each end,
but not quite enough to commit itself irre-
vocably to the keeping of its pledge and com-
pletion of the straight line. It is a grievous
pity, for the pro-State and anti-Federal
deviation grab can’t be repudiated too soon.
The North-to-South line is wanted very early
as a declaration that Australia is going to
stay in its own North and hold it. It is
wanted to prevent the death of the North,
which is perishing of insanity and being
ruined by wharf-lumping at 4d. per lb. The
arrival of the first train-load of sane pas-
sengers from the most mentally-composed
part of the mainland will have a soothing
effect on the poor gibbering creature called
Darwin, and should be the beginning of re-
covery. It is not merely a question whether
the completed line will pay, though it must
pay better than the incomplete one. The
medicinal aspect of the work must be con-
sidered.

The Tragedy of Pump Town.
Once every few months some godmotheriy
Sydney paper, generally the Telegraph,
sends its art enthusiast out to give an adver-
tisement to its misshapen godchild, Can-
berra. About that capital the art enthusi-
ast wrote the usual gushing generalities in
the ’Graph of December 6. He described
the grass, the special and remarkable air, a
tree or two, and the distant hills, or the
hum of the distant locust, all of which belong
to almost any place on the tableland between
Bairnsdale and Cooktown. Then with the
air of one who slammed down a clinchmg
argument he dropped in the usual unwise
remark: —
Water is pumped from the Cotter River to the
top of Mount Stromlo and then goes by gravita-
tion ....
There is no real future for a city deliberately
set on the top of a hill, So that water has
to be carried up to it in a bucket, or else
pumped up at great cost by great engines.
Even now, when the place isn’t beyond the
hamlet stage—that stage at which the simple
maid of fiction brings the water from the
brook in a pail—the pumping apparatus is
such a feature that the misguided admirer
can’t keep it out of his story. There are
innumerable good sites in Australia to which
water would come of its own volition as
soon as a channel was cut. There are some
to which it would come in such volume as to
supply light and heat almost gratis, and
power to drive machinery and tramcars.
But Canberra is to be the one expensive
Pump City in Australia, and probably the
one Pump City created needlessly and as a
matter of choice in all the world.
—♦
The Unemployed.
Even 20 or 30 years ago it began to be re-
marked that the unemployable class was too
much cultivated in Australia, and since then
it has grown up and married and multiplied
and fallen into difficulties. At one time not
verv long ago there was cheap money, and
there were works to build with it that really
had a chance of paying their way. Then the
States overdid the public works craze and
raised a generation of loan workers
pure and simple who have learned no-
thing save their own dead-end occu-
pation. Quite lately there was land
not far from the One Big City of each State
for settlers to go on to, and with a market
handy many of them did well, partly out of
produce and partly out of unearned incre-
ment. But now the land-settlement business
has slumped ; and so far as public works are
concerned, though borrowing is still enormous,
the scarcity and ruinous cost of imported
materials makes £3,000,000 go little further
in the manufacture of artificial employment
than £1,000,000 once did. An unusual series
of strikes, chiefly among the strongly-
entrenched class of skilled workers, hasn’t
improved things for the unskilled horde which
hangs on to the fringe of industry. So trouble
looms very large, and hag-ridden Govern-
ments, especially in N. S. IV ales and Queens-
land, can think of no remedy save “public
works.” Yet chronic house-famine and the
difficulty of getting skilled labor for steel
works and other industries go side by side
with the clamor of workless men of no
particular occupation. Recent investigations
by Basic Wage Commissions and such-like
are a pathetic record of the impossibility of
living on the value of an unskilled man’s
work when out of it almost everything is
brought from irresponsible profiteers six
or twelve thousand miles away, and
brought here by other irresponsible pro-
fiteers’ ships, and then levied on at
this end by an importing profiteer who
is often merely the agent for somebody in
London or New York. A typical witness on
this subject was the wife of a casual laborer
at £4 per week, whose children were probably
growing up to be casual Amid the de-
tails of a miserable scarcity of clothing, bare
living and utter lack of amusements it
was mentioned that she made the family
clothing herself —such little as could be
got—and that sewing cotton costs Is. per reel.
That is to say, the Coats world-wide com-
bine has put up the price about 500 per cent,
inside five years, which is the reason of its
£4,000,000 a year profits. The rise is only
in keeping with the going up of everything
else that is imported. If the monopoly raises
the price to Is. 6d. per reel, it is difficult
to see what Australia can do about it, save
turn aboriginal—or else grow more skilled
labor, and have fewer wharf-lumpers, and
fewer employees on Government loan jobs,
and fewer untrained people going on the
land with £lOOO of borrowed money, and
then it can make its own cotton and its
own most-other-things. The family of a
casual laborer at £4 ner week—which ought
to be a verv comfortable wage but isn t—
can no more afford the luxury of keeping
Coats than it can afford to. keep a yacht or
a racehorse or to specialise in prize St.
Bernard dogs. But before the casual laborer
can do much to free himself he must cease
to be an unskilled man; and if the unem-
ployed trouble is not to get worse instead
of better, Governments must cease to hold
out inducements to men —young men in par-
ticular —to take up mere unskilled, muck-
shifting occupations. Incidentally, those
who have been pushed or have drifted into
those occupations will have to realise that
thev are mere muck-shifting occupations,
and that it is not possible to pay them
except on a muck-shifting basis.
Laws Which Bring the Law into
Contempt.
“Lex” states a case: —
An opponent of prohibition recently mentioned
the difficulty the U.S. police are having with illicit
distillers, sly-grog purveyors, “boot-leggers” and
others, and suggested that since the new law evi-
dently could not be enforced it would be better
abolished. The. Rev. R. B. Hammond, of Sydney,
suggested brightly in reply that as burglary and all
other crimes persisted in defiance of the laws it
would be logical to also abolish the Courts and
the police force. The faLacy here is that while 99
people out of a hundred reprobate burglary and
shun anyone who practises it. not one in a Hundred
is able to regard the drinking of a glass of beer
as a crime or anything like one.
Australia already has enough laws which are
flouted without saddling itself with a fresh batch.
The most damaging examples are supplied Dy bettors
and gamblers. When the British Parliament passed
the Gaming Act and antecedent legislation there was
no doubt as to its intention. Wagering and gaming
were to be wiped out. But the Judges of tne day
were men of the world. They knew that gambling
could no more be eradicated from the national
character by statute than the reproductive instinct.
In point of fact, many of them were addicted to it
themselves. They started to systematically inter
pret the new measures out of existence. There was
no getting away from the fact that undei the
Gaming Act all wage s a id all transactions collateral
thereto are null and \ oid. But it was decided that
if a punter defaulted and the bookmaker agreed to
refrain from posting him at Tattersall’s in considera-
tion of an undertaking to pay later on, then because
of that promise a new and perfectly valid contract
arose. By these and a hundred kindred devices the
efforts of the anti-gamblers were brought to naught,
and such work as the judiciary left undone Society .
completed by siding with the bookies as against
anyone who appealed against them to the law of
the land. If the recent decision in the King’s Bench
Division that under the Gaming Act all cheque-bets
are recoverable stands, then one form of gambling
at least will have been dealt a deadly blow. But
the Judges will not see fashionable gambling seri-
ously hampered, much less killed. ‘‘Fashionable
gambling” is the correct expression, since it is only
those forms of it. in which kings, princes and the
rich do not indulge that are consistently assailed.
The Melbourne police are pre-occupied at present
with a wave of “illegal betting” which they prac-
tically admit has got the better of them. People
make books away from the racecourses, often as
agents for registered bookmakers, and they and
their patrons thus become liable to punishment,
though a Goyernor and his bookie may be doing
the same thing with impunity at the races. Two-
up schools in poor neighborhoods are continually being
raided all over Australia; yet clubs, of which many
Judges are members, and at which poker is regu-
larly played, are never raided, though poker has
been specifically declared “an illegal game” by the
High Court of England. Small betting-shops are
attacked by the police Without ruth; the big ones
only suffer through an error on the part of some
underling. A betting-shop in a really large way
of business will actually be assisted by the Govern-
ment in the form of a. special telephone installa-
tion. This phenomenon is not, of course, confined
to the Commonwealth. A recent judgment of Mr.
Justice Darling in a suit brought by a Birmingham
betting-shop employing 100 typists and owning a
private post-office might have been delivered in
Australia. “I cannot help reflecting,” he said,
“that other less fortunately circumstanced persons
than the plaintiffs are almost daily being proceeded
against by the States in the police-courts for carry-
ing on betting businesses. Fines and imprisonment
and no privileged treatment are the contribution
of the State to their operations. Really a person
who contemplates such a state of things cannot
reasonably complain that strangers in our midst call
us a nation of hypocrites.”
The chief objection to all these laws aimed at
universal human tendencies is precisely that one
which is indicated by the brilliant English Judge.
They are enforced rigorously against the poor, and
either feebly or not at all against the rich or
powerful. Every visitor from America is agreed
on at least one point—that anyone who can put up
the dollars will get alcohol of a sort. And simi-
larly it is easy and safe to bet in thousands or
hundreds, though not in half-crowns or shillings.
An inevitable effect of this is to respectabilise such
offences in the eyes of the unfortunates who are
caught and their friends. No one seriously thinks
the worse of a man because he has been fined for
doing what his “social superiors” are notoriously up
to every day of their lives. But a tremendous
amount of class bitterness is engendered, and there
arises among the poor and socially uninfluential a
tendency to look on the whole legal svstem as some-
thing that deserves to be tricked in the interests
of fair dealing. Respect for the law, respect for
authority, is thus undermined ; and it is hard to con-
ceive anything more dangerous than that at the
present time.

Quite a Non-Party Affair.
It is a nice point whether the Executive or
the Opposition played the more abject part
in connection with the N. S. Wales Parlia-
mentary salary steal. The Executive began
its attack on the cash by getting the authority
of the A.L.P. and other irresponsible bodies,
after which it appointed a Judge to say
that the raid was justified. All this because
Labor knew that in seizing the money
it was going counter to the wishes of a vast
number of those who will be required to
provide it, and that, though fresh from a
general election, no word about the increase
was breathed to the country. The Oppo-
sition, which exists nominally to protest
against just such acts, knew the same thing,
but those who are nominally in the House to
stop grabs of the sort were as keen as the
principals to see this one brought off. Their
method of helping the venture forward was
to call a party meeting, at which “it was
decided to allow members to vote as they
chose when the measure came before the
House” —just as the venal policeman, who
is qualifying for dismissal from the force,
winks the other eye when a big breaking-
and-entering job is in progress. The ap-
pearance of the bill in the Assembly was,
of course, the signal for the old stock pro-
testations. Fitz-Heep, M.L.A., said it was
a crime and he would only take the rise
under protest, and McPecksniff said it was
an outrage and he would never touch the
money. No one has talked in a loftier
strain on this question than Robert Best,
M.P. for Ivooyong, who, after getting im-
mense political capital out of his alleged
righteousness, has just drawn every penny
of his Parliamentary back pay. And in
this he has only followed the example of poli-
ticians of the past two decades, here and in
Britain. So that from the moment the bill
was first tabled in the Assembly it was cer-
tain that sooner or later the defenceless pub-
lic would be shot for the full swag aimed
at. “Thank God we have an Upper
House!” the plain citizen was heard to say.
Unfortunately in matters of this sort the two
Chambers are as one. Where it is a ques-

The Harbor Smash that Providence has
Averted.
“Mellish Reef” from the bridge:—
More by luck than anything else there has not of
recent years been a serious collision in Sydney Harbor
between ferryboats and oversea steamers. The oppor-
tunities for such are many, and when a smash does
occur I shan’t want to be in it. As the law stands
all ships have to obey the international rule of the
road, except in Circular Quay. My suggestion is
that whilst navigating in the waters bounded by an
imaginary line from Miller’s Point across Goat Island
to Ball’s Head, and another from Cremorne Point
across to Potts Point, all oversea and inter-State
ships— i.e., all ships other than those trading within
our coastal limits —should have absolute right-of-way.
The ferryboats with their propellers each end are
far better able to manoeuvre and keep clear of the
big ocean-goer than the ocean-goer is to keep clear
of them. When the Renown was in port all shipping
had to give her a clear run. Some of our deep-water
steamers have her draught, and still have to dodge
the ferries. And you don’t have a fair chance to
do it. When you are outward-bound and nearing
Dawes Point, the large two-decker shed on No. 1
wharf obscures all view of the Quay, and when
abeam you’ll generally find a few ferryboats blocking
the way and sometimes an old horse-punt as well.
Still proceeding- down there are more crossing ferries
and the other horse-punt from Fort Macquarie. Add
a few more ferries bound into the Quay—they should
all give way to you, but will not as long as they
can possibly clear your bow by 20ft. —and by the
time you pass Garden Island you can wipe the sweat
off your brow. Inward-bound, the ferries at or near
Kirribilli Point tear across your bows whether
they are in the right or not. In the limits men-
THE PERIL TO WHITE AUSTRALIA.
This great country has six State capitals and a proposed Federal capital. All seven
are south of the top line. Six are south of the middle line. Five, including the pro-
posed. Federal capital, are south of the hot tom. line. This is Australia’s way of tell-
ing the world that the North and Centre are quite ' unfit for a white man to live
in, and are only suitable for brown or black settlement. And the black-brown world
doesn’t miss the point.

Australia ought to feel—and how some of
it does feel when it sees one small group
scheming to. secure power far in excess of
what is due to either its numbers or its
real interest in Australia.
The Stoeey Government started work so
late in the year and tolerated so much fruit-
less talking when it did start that several
of its gaudy schemes for the regeneration of
N. S. Wales have been lost in the rush to
get into recess before the Summer Cup.
McGikr’s endowment of motherhood is one
of the measures that have missed the ’bus,
and Lang’s State lottery is another. But
perhaps it is just as well for Lang that his
gamble hasn’t materialised this year. The
delay will give him time to talk the matter
over with Wise, the Postmaster-General,
who has strong views on the subject of
sweeps on horse-races —the sort Lang pro-
poses to run—and might make things un-
pleasant if he isn’t converted. The Returned
Soldiers’ League in Westralia advertised
sweeps on horse-races, and Wise ruined
them by refusing the League the use of the
mails. A protest being lodged, Wise offered
to withdraw the embargo and let the sweeps
continue “provided they were kept free from
horse-racing in every shape and form.” The
League decided to abandon the sweeps, and
the organiser thereof dropped into a similar
job with the Labor people, who are raising
a propaganda fund by means of Cup sweeps
in serene contempt of Wise and his inter-
dicts. It seems that the Postal Depart-
ment only puts sweep-promoters under its
Dog Act when their offence is “brought
under its notice” —this “explains” why the
soldiers’ sweeps were blotted out and the
Labor sweeps are let alone. The explana-
tion is as pellucid as mud, and as convinc-
ing as a deceased cow. Considering that the
Post and Telegraph Department goes out
of its way to supply telegraph and telephone
facilities to shop-bookmakers and the like,
its antipathy to the relatively harmless
“consultation” form of gambling is incom-
prehensible. However, there it is: the
Department, according to its own statement,
does not interfere with lotteries—the
Queensland Golden Casket, for instance —
that are not associated with horse-racing.
Where the horse intrudes into the gamble,
and the fact gets past the bureaucracy’s blind
eye, its steel fist inexorably smites. So
Lang had better cut the thoroughbred out of
his five-shilling flutters. If he doesn’t he
will run the risk of Wise getting to hear
about them in years to come, and that
would mean trouble.

On another mad town’s latest lunacy:—
Broken Hill can always be trusted to find a new
excuse for knocking off work. For a dozen years
or more it has had a couple of daily papers—the
30-year-old Barrier Miner and the union-owned
Barrier Truth. A couple of years ago Davidson
of Melbourne Herald, put his own considerable
sayings on top of a few more thousands he somehow-
raised, bought the Miner, and started out full of
enthusiasm for welfare work and such like. Truth.
which has been a sink for the unions’ money, was in
low water, and Davidson really thought he would be
able to satisfy the Broken Hill workers that there
was no need to keep the expensive thing going. He
didn’t know the men who run the Broken Hill
Labor machine. The Miner had prospered by follow-
ing the simple rule of ignoring the existence of
Truth except when it was in difficulties: then
it always punctiliously offered its help. But David-
soNj . burning to do the right thing, no sooner saw
Truth make what it thought was an unfair attack
on a mining co., than it went to the co.’s defence.
1c was magnificent but it was not war—the war for
bread and butter as it has to be fought at Broken
Hill. The Miner was branded at once as “the
creature of the companies,” and you can’t be that
at Broken Hill and get the miners’ pennies. Truth,
union-owned, changes its literary staff every 24
hours or so; and it happened that at the moment
there wasn’t a man on the premises who was a
member of the journalists’ union—it was a scratch
crew struggling to keep the poor little thing afloat
at the end of the 18 months’ strike. The Miner,
stung- by being often called a creature of the companies,
called the other reptile a non-union rag, or words
to that effect; and when it wanted to say it again
the local printers’ union said it mustn’t. What
happened after that isn’t clear; what happens at
some time or other after a row lias started never
is clear. But what is clear is that, when the Miner told
the union that it couldn’t have its free speech inter-
fered with, the union replied that that is just
where the Miner was mistaken. After which the
Miner went into recess, and proceeded to issue
writs against everybody concerned, while the
printers’ headquarters in Sydney groped for a way
out of the bog. And when the bog has been left
behind . somebody ought to .talk seriously to the
union about the remarkable claim of the Broken Hill
printers devil to decide what a man shall have a
right to advocate in print. Nobody suffered more
than the worker from the efforts of employers and
other big advertisers to interfere with the freedom
of the press; nobody was more contemptuous of
newspapers which allowed such outsiders to influence
them. If unions themselves now attempt to trample
on that freedom, it will suggest that they
tuppence for the principle, but were merely annoyed
because the interference wasn’t for their benefit.
“Good Australian”: “Shoals of officials.
Geneva inundated.” Twelve thousand offi-
cials, clerks, secretaries and typists arrived
for the sessions of the League of Nations,
and the hotels could not hold them all. There
is a picture of bureaucracy in excelsis.
Democracy is being smothered under a
clutter of bureaucrats or Government offi-
cials. Everywhere in the world it is the
same, only more so in Australia. Here tin-
public owns most of the chief utilities, such
as water, railways, tramways, electricity,
and still the greater part of the land. Be-
fore very long the public will own and con-
trol banking, life and fire assurance, ship-
ping and the coal-mines. What is the use
of shrieking for economy when every new
law means the appointment of new public
servants to see it is carried out? What is
the use of declaiming against the increase
of budgets, State and Federal, when official
functions are subdivided and public
employees thereby multiplied? Railway
servants in Victoria are notoriously under-
paid, and directly it is proposed to give them
better pay a loud and prolonged howl re-
sounds through the State, while at the same
time every tinpot hamlet out back sends in
its claim for a cockspur line of railway to
take its spuds and wheat from Dan to Beer-
sheba. Of course, the railways don’t pay.
The public does not recognise that it con-
tinues to add hundreds to its paid non-pro-
ducers every year. In fact, it does not
understand that this is a growing bureau-
cracy, where the permanent heads of depart-
ments rule Ministers and run the country’s
finapces. The bureaucrat is a thorough-
bred Socialist, and he adds to his army
every day ; The moribund Mines Depart-
ment of Vic., for instance, is transforming
all its temporary hands into permanent offi-
cers, and when the Department disappears,
as is threatened, nobody will lose his job.
Until the next census in April, 1921, we
shall not know how many persons are paid
by the Government, but a guess gives one
Government servant to every two other
adults. The railway and tramway em-
ployees. roadmakers, bridge-builders, postmen,
pensioners, invalids, coal-miners (in Vic-
toria). water supply- and irrigation-workers
are all paid by the State, and their numbers
increase weekly, swelling the ranks of
Bureaucracy and making the stoppage of
borrowing well nigh impossible. It’s a curi-
ous epoch of this civilisation, and would
be ideal if any of these great public depart-
ments paid their way, but most of them do
not. Australia, flattering itself that it is
the most advanced because it has national-
ised most, is to-day really the purest bureau-
cracy, and. therefore, the poorest democracy
in the world.
Afloat with 777 Devils.
Randolph Bedford goes down the Bay:—
Six o’clock closing and the banning of the Sunday
newspaper make the noisy minority that governs
Melbourne believe that God’s in Ilis Collins-street
and all’s light with the world. And to prove it
they rang the church bells as our ship of 777 devils
crawled up the Yarra. With decks so full that there
were not seats for all, the ancient packet had left
the wharf eight hours earlier in driving warm rain
that was the rain of Townsville in January. It
made a warm haze upon the sea and limited the
vision to a mile. A few hundred passengers filed
up and down the gangways into the rain of the
forward deck and out again. Some were there who
distrusted their fellows so that they would not leave
their baggage, apparently, believing that he who
trusts the outside of the pub while he breasts the bar
wijl find a dog at his swag. Why anybody should
carry such quantities of baggage for a delirious day
on the bay did not seem clear until you knew that
all these papier-mache suit-cases and cane dress-
baskets were “carrier's" for the picnic. Even Sher-
lock 1. lmes, or the policeman who discovers a
town hall and calls it a clue, might diagnose
“picnic,” for the cover of one of the dress-baskets
bore fragments of the Hebrew’s Warning, commonly
known as pickled pork.
But even the Hebrew’s Warning does not explain
all the luggage these humorless people carried. One
had the furniture of a cottage and the graves of
a household —fiat cushions shaped like tombstones,
and all the furnishings except the toilet set and
the piano. Their promenadings had no apparent
purpose except the desire of a crowd to be crowded
—a mere animal rubbing against each other, inex-
plicable to the man who in a mob feels the dis-
comfort of the cockatoo in a small cage whose
bars wear his tail feathers to the quick. But at
least half of the travellers seemed to enjoy the
breathless, muggy contact, working into the rain
and out again; falling over couples sprawled by the
engine-room, so drugged with desire that they did
not move even when threatened by the feet of the
promenaders. There was a yahoo who talked with
his hands in a confined space and spat anywhere
but outside the ship; and another who sat on any-
body seated who was sufficiently Christian to tolerate
him. Through the press came a hard-faced ruffian
who carried his shocking cigar in a long holder
and burned the coat-collar of a taller man before
him. The smoker saw it, left it smouldering, and
jostled his way aft; on the principle of the hog
motorist who runs over a child and then modestly
races away on the high speed because somebody
might , ask him for his name. There were many
hogs of the sort common in tram-cars and trains —•
including the cross-legged hog whose function it is
to clean his boots on the skirts of passing women.
There were three ladies and three gentlemen in whom
a malted jealousy promised a fine show of yeast in
due season, and these cackled and shrieked in the
interminable procession and sought the rain again.
The humorlessness of such a “picnic,” including
nearly eight hours in a smellful sweat-box, struck
me as not Australian, and the faces of the people
strengthened me in the belief that this process of
spending money to be miserable is a “Benk ’Oliday”
matter, and imported. The faces of the promenaders
were immigrant faces —dull, heavy immigrant faces.
Their manner of enjoyment was that of the Ger-
mans described by Charles Reade in “The Cloister
and the Hearth”: “At short intervals one of their
number arose from his mug of sour beer, cried
in mournful tones ‘Let us frolic,’ and sat down
again to the sour beer.”
This is the dulness and the, melancholia that must
be killed out of. Australia before the real Australian
can be. It satisfies Southern wowserdom because
it doesn’t laugh, which is only a proof that it is
more wicked than if it did.
The “Benk ’Olidav” spirit shouldn’t have a vote
to discolor Australian politics, anyhow. There
should be a probation of five or six years, so that
existing provincialism may not 'be strengthened
by new provincialism and prejudices imported by
quaint electors who never had a vote before. To
these a vote too soon given is a very heady wine.
We landed to heavy rain. The love of the mob
to be overcrowded had its gratification as the mass
jostled on the decks and gangways. Two of the
three ladies who had malted their jealousy earlier
in the day developed warring cultures of yeast as
we left the wharf, and fought in the rain-pools in
the broken basalt spalls under the railway viaduct
at Flinders-street. One punched and scratched and
the other retaliated with a dress-basket that was
like the dress-basket that bore the Hebrew’s Warning
as a clue for Sherlock Holmes. When their blouses
were almost torn off the gentlemen intervened and
bore them away.
The last church bell stopped its dreadful knell.
“Let us frolic.” (Mind you say it in gloomy
tones.)
The ship of the seven hundred and seventy-seven
devils tied up for the night.


A strong, virile nation needs strong, virile
tasks on which to bend its energies. The
Iron and Steel Industry opens up such a
field of endeavor for Australian Manhood,
providing work that develops and fosters
self-control, initiative, stamina and force
of character.
The Australian
Iron! and Steel
Industry
would give employment at Australian rates of pay (if
all the Iron and Steel, goods imported into Australia
were made bjr our own people) to not less than
30,000 MEN,
who would earn over
£5»000,000 per year.
POLITICAL
POINTS
The “discovery” was made last week that,
by accepting the cheque fori £25,000, Hughes
bad infringed sub-section (iii.) of Section
45 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which
prescribes immediate forfeiture of a seat in
Parliament if a fee or honorarium is taken
for services rendered to thd Commonwealth.
The sub-section was inserted at the instance
of Joe Carruthers (N.S.W.) at Adelaide,
and subsequently confirmed, and his object
was to prevent the handing out of fat Crown
briefs to Parliamentary barristers. If the
sub-section can be stretched to include
Hughes’s “testimonial” one man will cer-
tainly be very much surprised. That one is
Garran, who did the devilling for the draft-
ing committee, and now gets £2OOO a year for
keeping Hughes on the rails.
Here is Considine, M.P., writing to an
Independent Laborist to say that he wants
to help the re-election of Hugh Mahon, not
for Mahon’s own sake, not for Australia’s
sake, but in order to give Dail Eirann all
possible assistance. The sooner Ireland is a
Republic and the Irish thus automatically be-
come aliens, the sooner Australia will be able
to have a Parliament that will devote itself
to its own affairs. Meantime one is entitled
to have some doubts about the high morality
of gentlemen who take a thousand a year
each and help others to a similar thousand
apiece, not to advance the interests of their
employer, but in order to give Dail Eirann
“all possible assistance.”
It is time even a sluggish community
wakened up when a member of a House
elected by the most popular suffrage possible
threatens revolution if the majority is
against him, and promises the usurpation of
power by a violent minority. That was
what Brookfield did when he said to the N. S.
Wales Assembly: “If you don’t pass these
reforms” [i.e., if the majority of the people’s
representatives don’t think they are “re-
forms”] “they will come by direct action.” In
other words, riot will be let loose, with any
theft, murder, arson and rape that may hap-
pen, when the law is suspended, and the rule
of the people will end. Even a nolice-court
summons for threatening language would be
some sort of a protest.
Ten or more years ago, it seems, when
he was young and charming, John Storey
was tempted by a pastoral devil. It was
a matter of “bending” a certain 90-mile sec-
tion of N.S.W. railway in the middle to
bring it within six miles of a 100,000-acre
property wlich would thereby have its value
enhanced by 20s. per acre. The offer
(treated with scorn) was £30,000. Of
course, the devil would put nothing in wait-
ing, and devils often fail to pay unless the
thing is in writing. Now people are look-
ing up 90-mile sections of railway which
were under consideration by the Works
Committee when John Storey was a member
—9O-mile sections with a 100,000-acre estate
anywhere near. There are mighty few, for
the big western leaseholds are out of the
hunt. Having put the finger of suspicion
on the map and noticed the bentness or
otherwise of the railway, the drawing of
inferences will then proceed. And there
will be the nastiest inference of all if no
such railway and no such estate can be
. found.
A cable from Geneva refers to Millen as
“Australia’s lone representative.” It may be
all right now, but the “lone” will be a mis-
print as soon as he gets to London.
The Government in Queensland put up a
real effort last year on its railways, and
actually got the year’s shortage down to
£1.229,579. The complete figures to June,
1920, are not to hand yet, but what was
wrong in 1919 was mainly this: —
One (1) section (100 miles) paid working expenses
and interest and made a small profit.
Seventeen (17) sections (2353 miles) paid working
expenses and a trifle towards interest. One section
paid Id. per £lOO for the year; two paid Gd. per
£lOO, and so on.
Sixty-four (64) sections (3150 miles) paid nothing
towards interest. Some of these had to have all
their interest paid out pf taxes and lost 7 per cent,
on their capital in addition.
It was when Theodore asked the British
capitalist for £9,000,000 at about 04 or 7
per cent, to invest in the same way that
John Bull became alarmed. A loan spent
on works like the famous 3159 miles of rail-
way that require £BOO,OOO a year out of
tax money to keep them. going is like lend-
ing a man money on his debts, with the cer-
tainty that every million advanced will make
the burst more certain.
The Ma State got the worst of the
drought last year, having less than three
bushels per acre. The previous year, with
74 bushels, it was also below’ a very poor
average; in fact, wheatgrowing since 1917
THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW.
“The unemployed in Sydney metropolitan district were said last- week to have increased to over 15,000.”
INQUIRING STRANGER: “Why this long-drawn-out caravan of woe ?”

hardly paid for seed, and the farmer lived
on debts and gum-leaves. This year was to
be something like a record, and then things
happened. The A.W.U. suddenly demanded
double wages. News went round that the
State Government hadn’t a bean with which
to pay its cash guarantee of 2s. Gd. per
bushel. Finally a deluge fell on the ripened
crops, and in a few days, as far as can
be judged, from one-quarter to one-third of
the expected yield dissolved in mist. Inciden-
tally, Australia imports about £150,000,000
worth of goods a year. If we produced two-
thirds of them ourselves we should have a
few more weather-proof industries. We need
them badly.
Leg. Councils have sniffed the carcase, too,
and in Victoria a baker’s dozen of members
would like to have a dip in the Treasury.
The majority of the House, however, shares
with the Government the view that the
electors have not been consulted, and it is
likely that an absurd little thing like that
will prevent the grab.
Stove-manufacturer W. G. Minchinton,
who has petitioned the Vic. Leg. Assembly
to declare that Donald Mackinnon is the
real member for Prahran. on the ground that
he was the only qualified person duly nomi-
nated, seems to be a sort of Richard Doe
in the attempted ejectment proceedings agin
Parker. He is quite entitled as an elector
to lodge the petition, and as much heed must
be paid to it as if it had come from Mac-
kinnon. The allegation in the seventh
clause of Minchinton’s petition, as gazetted,
is that Parker, the Laborite who topped the
poll, was an uncertificated insolvent on nomi-
nation and election days, and was, conse-
quently, expressly barred under Sec. 134 of
the Constitution Act Amendment Act 1915.
Labor's version is that a. bank pressed
Parker, as one of three, for money advanced
to him to pay duty on imported machinery,
that after an order nisi for compulsory se-
questration was made the claim was satisfied,
and. as there was no apnearance of the
parties on the day appointed for the hearing
of the application for an order absolute, the
case was struck out. It is doubtful if
there will be any decision till next July, as
the Elections and Qualifications Committee
will hardly have time this session. Mac-
kinnon is to leave for England, on a visit,
in March.
In the morning the N.S.W. Assembly
pleaded that, the country being now divided
into large electorates, members should be paid
more. At uoon it decided that this was a
most proper plea, and the House made the
salary three times more than it was before
the war loaded the country with debt and
plunged it into poverty. And in the after-
noon, having fixed up the foregoing to its
complete satisfaction, the Government pro-
ceeded with a bill to abolish the large elec-
torates and revert to one-man constituencies.
Yet. there are said to be not more than three
men in the House who were ever professional
spielers and confidence-men.
After finishing up the work of the session
Vic. Treasurer McPherson will leave for
England on December 29 on a private busi-
ness triii. lie will go overland to Fremantle
and catch the Orvieto at Fremantle. Law-
son will take charge of the Treasury. Next
session McPherson proposes to look at Par-
liamentary procedure from a business-man’s
point of view, and try to make some simplify-
ing amendments.
No wonder J. Bull feels cold. The men
who, for a consideration, guaranteed the
success of N.S.W.’s £4,000,000 loan at 64
per cent, had to take lip £2,800,000 of it
themselves because the public didn’t bite.
And when they began to unload the price
promptly fell to £99.
The loan slump is having one noticeable
effect —it is compelling the State Frights to
adopt the simple, obvious reforms for which,
when the razzle was on, they had a lordly
disdain. In the-same week S. Aus. has inti-
mated that it will conduct its general election
on- the Commonwealth roll, and Westralia
that it will get its land and income taxes
collected by the Federal department.
Senator Lynch, who is authorised to speak
for his own State (Westralia, population
340,000) on Australian affairs, but not
necessarily on Irish or Indian or Boer
affairs, has. sent a long cablegram to a high
priest at Armagh, saying that Australia is
powerfully in fftvor of Irish autonomy, but
if anyone thinks this country will agree to
an Irish republic he is barking up the
wrong shamrock. In this.he is possibly not
quite disinterested. Irish autonomy would
still leave people of Irish birth or parentage
to be subjects of the Empire, with the same
old claim—a very solid and profitable one—
to run Australian affairs and draft Profit-
eering Bills and Land Bills and Loan Bills
for us. and to fight out the relative merits
of Irish autonomy, republicanism or a rever-
sion to unionism in. our Parliaments, just as
Nationalists and Sinn Feiners do in their
own land. Complete independence would
shut a multitude of them, as alien subjects,
out of our Parliaments and _ municipalities
and affairs, and make the Irish question a
closed book here. It might be bad for
Senator Lynch, but it should be a blessed
rest for Australia.
Reported, by the hostile Sydney Tele-
graph, of all papers, that the next section
of the great North to South direct line (150
miles to Daly Waters) can’t be even sur-
veyed till the wet season is over. Any
inland 150 miles of Australia with a wet
season cries aloud for attention. Along
1250 miles of the East to West railway
there is hardly a “wet,” let alone a wet
season.
Since conscription disrupted the Labor
party Boulder has been the A.L.P. stronghold
in the Ivalgoorlie Federal electorate, and in
the State Assembly it is represented by
Opposition-leader Collier. But at an elec-
tion the other day National Labor candidates
won all four vacant seats on tjhe Boulder
Council, the A.L.P. nominees (<fne of them
a councillor) being decisively drubbed. It
doesn’t brighten the prospect for Hugh
Mahon.
With Alec Peacock as its navigating lieu-
tenant, the Lawson crew got through the
session with more success than Was thought
possible when it was meeting the no-
confidence attack at the end of November.
It was Peacock who planned the scheme for
side-tracking the Estimates temporarily after
the first item of the Budget had been dis-
posed of, so that a string of bills could be
passed, and then taking up the Estimates and
holding an all-night sitting on them. The
oldest hand in the House can teach even
Lawson (with a mere 21 years’ experience)
a few tricks in the horrible game.
If anybody had predicted a feW months ago
that N.S.W. Premier Storey would be found
before the first session was over voting with
the Opposition against his own Government
he would have been regarded as a fit subject
for a soap-box in the Domain. Yet it has
come to pass. For proof see page 3016 of
Hansard, which records the picturesque
doings of the Billingsgative Assembly. There
in the division list will be found Storey
wedged in between Perdriau and Wearne
with Onslow and Fuller in close proximity.
It occurred cm a.vote on a motion by George
Gann, Minister for Labor, to insert certain
words in the Workmen’s Compensation
Amendment Bill, a Government measure of
some importance. The truth is John was
caught yapping. He was swapping yarns
with Fitzpatrick when the bar fell and he
was on the wrong side, and the forms of the
House did not permit him to cross over to
the side where he wanted to be.

The Victorian executive of the A.L.P. has resolved:
That branches of the Australian Labor Party and
Federal and State members of Parliament be cir-
cularised impressing upon them the urgent need of
taking steps to oppose the carrying out of the Gov-
ernment proposal in regard to the training camps for
youths under the defence scheme, considering that
such a scheme is injurious to the youths concerned,
and is calculated only to pander to the militaristic
spirit which is being sedulously promoted by a certain
class against the trug' interests of the Commonwealth.

From the Federal Gallery:—
The interjector is rarely popular, but he often
enlivens a dull debate; and Lamond is the type of
man whom the bored attendant will ever call blessed.
Let the discussion be ever so vapid, he can be
guaranteed to drench it with vinegar by a well-
chosen sneer from his place in the corner. He is
an adept at starting an explosion. His gibes, often
charged with inner knowledge of fdtener colleagues’
shortcomings, get under waistcoats
and start a flood of hostile reminiscence that is
designed to make the. offender pinker than Nature
intended. Lamond’s own aplomb has increased under
these counter-attacks, and he can .now smile through
a drum-fire of insults without running a temperature.
An amiable and well-meaning enough politician, he
has won the undying enmity of several -field-marshals
in Ryan’s army ; and Parker Moloney, ho mean hand
himself at embittered interruption, has vowed that
when Labor reaches power he will be Chairman of
Committees for the mere pleasure of suspending
Lamond for three centuries the first time he inter-
jects. V . '

THE GROAN OF THE OVERGOVERNED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To that far distant time when Hope ran high,
To Federation Day, with many a sigh
We turn our thoughts, and wonder ean it be
That who W’ere then Ourselves can now be We?
Reforms were promised at each G.P.O.
Where men moved fast who now are going slow ;
We changed a service, seeming scant of worth,
For what has proved the very worst on earth.
Economies we dreamed of, artless souls,
When Federal forces ousted State controls;
Yea, in the future of our new content.
We saw the vision of One Parliament,
One Governor, in place (ye gods) of seven,
And hailed the coming democratic heaven.
But all the Parliaments we knew of yore
Are with us still, and costing more and more ;
Their members, loud of speech and void. of shame,
Are more than ever living on the game,
Raising their stipend, sometimes pound' for pound,
A frank conspiracy of Grab all round
Which none can' check —a strong lawgivers’ league
That joins all parties, in one long intrigue
To help themselves. It seems the time is near
When Bunce will draw five thousand pounds a year
As Caucus member, sent to legislate
Three days a week, for Commonwealth or State,
For six months of the year ; which bloated screw
Will serve to bribe the blokes to whom is due
His re-election, till, on their advice,
The members re-conspire to raise thdir price.
And then the worm will turn. I know not what

THE OLD BALL ROOM
, ■—X.
REY is the floor with drifted velvet dust,
Ka Grey the branched sconces on the mantelshelf;
• The heavy air is choking-sweet with must,
The. smell of years, the breath of Time himself.
Alone I watch the lightning’s witcheries
People the night with mirth and pomp again;
Light steps, to ghosts of old-world melodies,
Mix with the whispers of the summer rain.
11.
See the Minuet with its sober pride
Of measured movement, a rustling tide
w Of color that softly ebbs and flows!
Our charmers move through the grave glissade
in curtseying billows of rich brocade —
Oh, daffodil, lilac, and aslics-of-rose!
Ivory bosoms and proud sweet lips,
Touching of exquisite finger-tips,
Glitter of buckles on poin ted toes;
Beckoning turn of a smooth young throat,
Swirl of a lutestring petticoat —
Oh, silver clocks on the peachbloom hose!
Sword and ruffle and slow, sly fan,
Lure of woman and ardor of man,
Languid melting from pose to pose;
Looks that meet like a long embrace
Down the stately dance with its stilted grace —
Oh, hot young hearts of the Belles and Beaux!
111.
Lady Di is scarce sixteen —
(How the fiddles sigh!)
Courtiers round this timid queen
Set her in a sweet amaze,
Pit to swoon beneath their gaze,
Innocent, so shy!
Driven at last to dare defence
(How the fiddles sigh!)
Di finds undreamed recompense
Tn the homage that she sips;
Sudden dimples round her lips
Threaten: "By and bye — /”
i Yore the Jeering Cupids see
(It ok. th e fiddles sigh !)
0 a ivning kitten-cru,elty
Hint the consciousness of power.. . .
Hcigho! Thorns must guard a flower
Like wild-rose Lady Di.
IV.
’Tis Sir Roger de Corerley closes the hall —
Come, step to your places, good folk one and all
For gay cry the hautboys and down the long hall
Trip the little red shoes of Clarinda.
So low are the hows from, her own favored three —
Will she dance with Sir Ralph, or with Robert, or me?
Alas, it is handsome young Alwin we see
Guide thy little red shoes of Clarinda!
So demurely, so coyly, her eyelashes fall,
But hotv her feet twinkle! '‘Sure, gentlemen all,
’Tis your hearts that we dance on adown the long hall!”
Ljaugh the little red shoes of Clarinda.
V.
Near to dawn, and the Brave alone
Linger here whence the Fair have flown,
And Fifty-fire like a hoy would play,
And Twenty swaggers, alack-a-day!
Passions are high with dice and wine,
Young Alwin’s honor is superfine —
A laugh, a sneer, and a woman’s name —
Then a sudden ring round, a deadly game.
Somebody’s foot has slipped in blood —
A thrust and a fall, and a, widening flood
Of horrid red on the dancing-floor
And the lights reel madly—no more, no more!
VI.
Oh, cold, bright folk that the years enclose!
Come back, old loves, old friends, old foes,
Back to a heart yet warm
Even to glimpses the lightning shows
Smiled through a flash of storm!
But the lightning has winked itself away —
And who were Sir Ralph and Clarinda, pray?
And Alwin, and Ijady Di?
And who—(Oh, I long for the tv hole-
some day
With its sunshine!) —who was I?

Though the profits shown for the past
year are larger than for any previous term,
the co. did better in 1918 with an under-
writing surplus of £39,357, compared with
£33,731 for the-latest run. The profits for
1918, however, are given in the table after
deducting £lO,OOO provision for future tax-
ation. Only on two previous occasions has
the loss rate been milder than for the past
year, and that was when the British navy
came to the rescue of the insurance cos. and
gave fat profits from higli-premium marine
business. Considering the all-round inflation
of values'" and the lively condition of Maori-
Lnd trade, the National’s premium figures
have not moved ahead so rapidly as might
have been expected :

The feature of that table is that for the first
time on record expenses have exceeded the
amounts distributed in claims, the ratio hav- *
ing now mounted to over 40 p,c. The cost of
writing and handling business is, however, no
higher than formerly, the increased propor-
tion being due solely to. heavier Government
taxes. For 1915 taxes called for £0050.;
for the past year £19,981 was charged
against underwriting and the M.L. Treasury
also took £6994 of the £29,645 income from
investments. Expenses apart from taxes _ in
1915 absorbed 32.5 p.c. of net premium m-
come; for the past year the cost was 31.2 p.c.
The high proportion of funds in rela-
tion to risks (as measured by premium in-
come) has always been a strong point with
the National. At the latest balance paid
capital was £200,000 and after paying hand-
some dividends (the latest 16i p.c. is equal
to 32| p.c. on capital as it stood prior to the
issue of bonus scrip in 1916) reserves total-
led £424,811. Total funds thus amounted to
£624.811, equal to 318 p.c. of the last year’s
net premium income. That is about double
the proportion of funds to risks which is
generally looked for. Put another way,
the National has funds ample to meet claims
in excess of 7! times last year’s losses—-
an. unusually strong proportion. In addi-
tion there is £BOO,OOO of uncalled capital to
fall back upon.
In pre-war days the National of ALL. had
practically seven-tenths of its assets re-
presented by mortgages, not the best of secu-
rities for the funds of an insurance office
which might suddenly be hard hit and be
called upon to realise on its investments
hurriedly. At the 1915 balance there was
no sign of any Government securities on the
hooks, unless they were parcelled up with a
vague item labelkvl “debentures. Ine
higher rates of interest offering on mortgages
was no doubt responsible for the directors
weakness for mortgages. Since the oppor-
tunity of taking up War Loan offered the
National has reduced its mortgages by practi-
cally one-half, and there is now over a quarter
of a million of public securities on the books.
Here is a comparison of assets over five
years : —■ , .

On average total assets the income from
investments, before paying taxes, now re-
turns slightly over 44 p.c.. practically the
same as it was five years ago. So not only
are the investments a much improved lot.
but the co. is getting an equally good re-
turn. Last year £22.651 net was got from
interest and rents, alone providing a divi-
of 114 P-c. for shareholders. That
means that £23.882 of the underwriting
surplus of £33.731 was left in the business
to strengthen funds for policy-holders.
Buckley and- Nunn, Ltd., soft-goods re-

That spring of almost £60.000 in profits needs
some explanation. As an English concern
Buckley and Nunn’s had no pref. capital, but,
instead, was working on £131,625 of de-
bentures... When the co. re-registered in Aus-
tralia the debenture debt was liquidated
and an issue of £150,000 7 p.c. pref.
shares was made in its placte, The
profits given for 1910 are shown after
meeting debenture interest; those for the
past year, prior to paying pref. divs.
A truer view of how very handsomely the co.
has done recently is got by ascertaining tin'
profits available for t;he ordinaries: for 1919
£42,059; for the past year, £91,846. Mean-
time the ordinary capital has moved but
slightly—from £183,338 to £190,838. So for
the last year there was 48 p.c. on their capital
available for ordinaries. Shareholders, how-
ever, got a trifling 10 p.c. in cash divs., but
£03,613 of profit has since been utilised to
give them a 33J p.c. bonus in scrip, one new
ordinary being passed out for every three
previously held. These very fat results are
further evidence of how very well recent con-
ditions have suited such concerns. The loan
fever has run high throughout the past year,
the issue of gratuity bonds adding to the Hood
of paper money which the public already had
to play with. “The result of trading,” say
the directors of this co., “was eminently
satisfactory, the increase being i largely due
to the greater volume of business done.”
There is not the slightest doubt about the
latest run having been “eminently satisfac-
tory” to B. and N.’s, but meantime the Com-
monwealth has slipped further into the hands
if the mortgagees. The very handsome profits
have been due wholly to abnormal conditions,
which cannot continue indefinitely. This
means that the future of Buckley and Nunn’s
must not be gauged by its lately-disclosed
figures.
How the balance-sheet entries have moved
over three years is shown hereunder :

After the latest dividend distributions there
was £417,754 in net tangible assets. De-
ducting £150,000 representing the security
for pref. capital there remained £267,754
of net tangibles for the enlarged register of
254,433 ordinary £1 shares or almost 21s.

expensive stocks (included “at cost or
under”) and the heavy book debts there
is not a wide visible protection for the
face value of this scrip, but, since the old
proprietors hold most of these ordinary
shares, the public is not much interested.
To. give the prefs. 7 p.c. and the ordinaries
10 p.c. in future will call for £35,943 p.a..
so profits would have to slump badly if these
distributions were not possible. The prefs’.

In the ’forties Charles Davis and a partner
established a tin- and copper-smithy, and
from those small beginnings was developed
one of Hobart’s largest hardware businesses.
It had grown so large by 1911 that the
founder, then SO years old and still in active
business, decided to pass the concern over
to a public co. with a paid capital of
£135,000, 10,000 £1 shares being paid for
goodwill. The old veteran went jvest in
1914, having missed only one Board meeting
from the time the co. was formed. Charles
Davis, Ltd., started off by paying 8 p.c. divs.
with ease, but some of the income which
contributed to early profits did not actually
belong to the years to which it was credited.
When the co. purchased the business very
liberal allowance had been made for bad
debts, and most of the doubtful accounts
were made good shortly after the co. got to
work. Had it not been for these recoveries
the 8 p.c. from the start would not have
been possible. After this source of revenue
dried up war made operations difficult, but
profits have gradually improved again, until
for the last year they showed over 114 p.c.
on paid capital. The div. rate has now been
lifted to 8 p.c. again, and, for the first time,
there are net tangible assets with a book
value to represent the whole of paid capital.
Another view of the progress made since the
co. took over the business is disclosed in this
comparison:—

At August 31 the book value of stocks was
only a couple of thousands more than eight
years ago, while book debts have expanded by
over £12,000, hinting that the co. is finding
a ready market for its wares, but experi-
encing difficulty in replenishing stocks. The
heavier book debts and extension of premises
have necessitated a bank overdraft of
£13,4.49, but on the other side is £7555 on
fixed deposit and £8503 invested in public
securities. At. August 31 there was a sur-
plus of liquid assets over liabilities of
£102,070, compared with £111.240 eight years
ago. But meantime the book value of fixed
assets has expanded £15,813. The intro-
ductory table shows that, after paying an
average div. of 7 p.c. over nine years, the
co.’s position has been improved by £13,825,
this storage of profits being equal to another
1 p.c., of paid capital. As mentioned above,
this accumulation of profits has resulted in
the Is. per share formerly represented by
goodwill now being protected by tangible
assets.
Sogeki Para Rubber Co., Ltd. —This is
a Sydney eo. which in 1010 exchanged
20,000 fully-paid £ 1 shares for a 1500-acre
block 32 miles east, of Port Moresby, and
began with 115 acres planted and 12,294
contributing shares to develop the estate
further. So far only 558 acres have been
planted, a further 125 acres have been
cleared, and 817 acres are still jungle. Tap-
ping commenced on a small scale in 1913,
and production to date has been as follows:

As usual, original estimates were not worth
much, for the whole of the subscribed capi-
tal and profits since accumulated have
planted only a little more than one-third
of the area available. And the latest 5 p.c.
div. to shareholders is not to be taken too
seriously, for they are invited to accept the
full amount in new shares. A few years
ago the management had to fall back upon
£1750 of debentures, and though that debt
has been worked off, at the latest balance
stocks of rubber, stores and trading goods,
sundry debtors and cash together totted up
only £2990 (£3B of it cash), while £3760
was owing on various accounts. Under
these circumstances the declaration of a
dividend was hardly justified, though no
doubt most shareholders have accepted scrip
in lieu of cash, for the co. is now at a
stage of production that may give good re-
turns under favorable conditions, and it
would be bad policy to let others grab
shares at par. Last year’s profits repre-
sented an almost exact 10 p.c. on paid capi-
tal. The position for the current year is not
at all hopeful. Sogeri all-in costs are over
Is. per lb., and though last year the
co. averaged 2s. for its product, the present
London price is several pence under pro-
duction costs, unless the latter have been
cut down hard. The world’s rubber mar-
kets are in a bad way, too, owing to indus-
trial and financial troubles, and to counter-
act low prices planters have devise.d a go-
slow tapping programme to reduce a pros-
pective glut. Under these circumstances
it is doubtful whether Sogeri manager Sef-
ton will reap his estimated harvest of
183.0001 b. this year. But the co. is in this
position: every 3d. per lb. of profit it can
make on production on a yield of these
dimensions maans about 0 p.c. on capital, so
if the industrial horizon clears and a demand
sets in for rubber there are possibilities
ahead, provided, of course, that the estate
remains in healthy condition. But there
is a further factor to consider; Sogeri still
requires additional funds for clearing and
planting, and no doubt some of the future
profits will be earmarked for that work.
Incidentally, manager Sefton throws an in-
teresting side-light on Papuan labor, which
has been scarce lately. “It must not be
thought,” he says, “that the native popula-
tion is not sufficient for all present require-
ments. On the contrary, there are plenty of
men, but they have shown a marked disin-
clination to recruit. Perhaps the greatest
factor has been the very high price of all
goods usually purchased by a time-expired
native, especially tobacco, and he now lands
back in his home with very little to show
for his labo.rs, and, as he has not to work
to live, he naturally stops at home.” Happy
Black Brother, who, when h.c.l. threatens
to bite him, simply stays at home and con-
tentedly does without!

Despite the recent Commonwealth embargo
on imported carbide, the Hydro-Electric Co.
operating at Electrona (Tas.) is apparently
up against it so badly that unless the State
sends a big parcel of good money after the
large number of smaller lots already poured
into the show, game and persistent old battler
Cillies must cry a go. Long spells of idleness
consequent on electrode and transformer
troubles sent the little co. financially lame
in its infancy ; then, having surmounted these
and other difficulties, and having got into a
good, even stride in the production of first-
class carbide, it found its product bludgeoned
off the market by foreign dumpers. The
Federal embargo came late, as the dumpers
had landed sufficient carbide to last the Com-
monwealth many months at a price in th>-
neighborhood of £27 a ton —about £3 less than
Electrona’s price and allegedly about £lO less
per ton than the stuff is marketed in the
dumping party’s home country. When, how-
ever, the dumped supply is used up Elec-
trona reckons it will be all right, and accord-
ing to figures presented to Tas. Assembly by
Treasurer Lewis the reckoning looks pretty
likely. The co.’s liabilities total about
£BO,OOO, two-thirds of which is owing to the
Government, the other third to banks, deben-
ture-holders and sundry creditors. The plant
is producing 85 tons of carbide weekly (and
could be made to produce 100 tons), but the
output is being stored because it can’t be sold
at a profit until the dumped supply vanishes.
The House has authorised Treasurer Lewis
to guarantee 6 p.c. for 10 years on £120,000,
which the co. proposes to raise by debentures
(mostly in London) to wipe off existing debts
and provide £40,000 working capital. With
an assured sale at £3O it is estimated that the
co. should be able to pay back its borrowings
long before the State guarantee expires and
make a start to get something for share-
holders. Whether shareholders win or lose
depends on how long carbide stays on the pro-
hibited list. In reply to the question
why the Speck Government, which owns the
electric power that makes Electrona possible,
doesn’t foreclose and run the carbide works
as a State affair, Treasurer Lewis says he
badly wants to lay immediate hands on the
£50,000 due by the co. to the State, and is
not prepared to find straight off the £30.000
necessary to settle the claims of the banks
and make the State’s (second) mortgage
good. And even the Labor members seem
disinclined to press for absolute State owner-
ship in this case, probably because they would
not care to be party to foreclosure on Gillies,
who pioneered the Great Lake hydro-electric
scheme.

“J.L.S.”: Admiral Clarkson’s presidential
address to the Junior Institution of
Engineers on oil possibilities in Australia is

an oil-prospecting territory by virtue of the

often washed up on its coasts, the configura-
tion of the strata at depth still being an
unknown quantity. The Admiral raised the
old bogey of alleged interference with

them might be acting on behalf of big petro-
leum trusts, which q,re afraid of losing their
wonderful Australian market for oil-products.
Apart from the Vacuum and Texas cos. and
one or two minor exporting houses, Sam’s Oil
interests in Australia are very minor. In
a few years’ time American oil exports
to tlie Commonwealth will fall off consider-
ably, and supplies of petroleum products from
the gigantic reserves held by the Royal
Dutch; Shell, Anglo-Persian and other com-
bines will arrive in largely-increasing quan-
tities. The petrol, lubricants and fuel-oil of
the world, outside America, will, if the pre-
sent Anglo-French campaign to restrict
American operators to the American con-
tinent is successful, be nominally British,
whatever the country of origin of the oil.
Every one of the groups mentioned are'
intensely interested in finding and develop-
ing oil supplies in every sphere of British,
French and Dutch influence. The fact that
the TI.S. oil reserves are dwindling rapidly,
thereby forcing rigid curtailments of exports
in the near future, and that, long after the
oilfields of the U.S. have ceased to yield in
any quantity, British and allied fields will
be at the height of their production, is in-
direct evidence against the idea that the
big oil corporations are determined to block
oil-prospecting and pioneering in this coun-
try, Anyhow, if past experience both in
the Commonwealth and in Maoriland has
shown negative results from the employment
of Yankee drillers, why not for the future
try a change and engage drillers and oil
experts with legitimate experience in British
and Dutch fields?

The Hill End field (N.S.W.) got to
another sta.ge this week, when Hawkins Hill
Central anu Deeps shareholders met to discuss
a belated amalgamation. They should never
have been handled separately; all the cos.
operating there should have got together
from the beginning. Central has exhausted
its cal bug power, its final call having just
about covered liabilities ; Deeps still has com-
mand of a sixpenny call (£2375), available
for development. Now it is proposed to
merge both into Hawkins Hill Consolidated,
in 350,000 shares of ss. each, Deeps share-
holders receiving 11 fully-paids for .each
present share, and Central share for share,
142,500 in all going to the former and
100,000 to the latter. Then 50,000 new
contribs. are to be offered to provide much-
needed working capital. All Deeps has to
offer after its years of work is a “substan-
tial body which promises to ensure profitable
crushing for some time. This period is,
however, uncertain, as the extent of the body
is unknown, and its value unproved.’’ In
Central “a run of good stone on the Mica
vein is being developed, which extends from
the 500 ft. level of the Patriarch shaft down-
wards for perhaps 150 ft., with a length at
that level of about 70ft., but below this the
length is undisclosed.” But this vein shades
away to inches, so, though about l£oz. may
“fairly represent the average value,” prospec-
tive tonnages are slender.
The record of the Hill End field during re-
cent years has been a drab one. Instead of the
various cos. combining to undertake a com-
prehensive scheme of development, they have
been fossicking rather than mining. Now
and then a pocket has been unearthed, and
Pitt-street has shown spasms of excitement.
But fossicking for pockets never made a mine.
What has become of that ambitious pro-
posal, recommended by the Mines Depart-
ment, to drive a main tunnel and crosscut
to the veins? After considerable coaxing the
N.S.W. Prospecting Board was induced three
years ago to set aside £lOOO of the year's
£OOOO vote to subsidise the cos. £ for £ if this
comprehensive scheme to work the field was
undertaken. So far as can be ascertained
only £2O of the £lOOO vote has been drawn,
and, instead of undertaking joint systematic
prospecting, the cos. have merely proceeded
on hand-to-mouth fossicking methods.

Great Cobar (N.S.W.) was jolted the
other day when application for suspension
on its Cobar Gold and Chesney leases was
refused by the Warden. It now looks, if
the Minister supports the decision, that
something more than paper schemes must
materialise before long. The huge stack of
coke, the whole of the electrical equipment,
the'- steel shed over jackets and converters,
including overhead cranes, and four of the
six boilers on the parent mine have been
sold and are being dismantled and shipped
away.
* * * *
C.S.A., Cobar, also appeared before the
Warden seeking six months’ suspension.
According to the co.’s experts, it is unlikely
that the mine fire has yet burnt itself out,
and they consider that it would be extremely
dangerous to re-open. Four months’ sus-
pension was granted, but the Warden told
the applicant co. that before granting further
suspension he would require experts to
be placed in the witness-box. As a drought
was in full blast when the fire first broke
out, frantic appeals were made to the Gov-
ernment for water and trainage to flood the
mine. When rain came and plenty of water
became available, the co. suddenly discovered
that on account of the nature of the ore
the flooding scheme was impossible. But mean-
time copper had slumped badly, and £30,000
worth of the metal still remains unpaid for.
Cobarites, with the memory still fresh in
their minds of the State support given to
the co. for railway connection at a cost of
about £25,000, may be forgiven for thinking
that there is a moral obligation on the direc-
tors to make every effort to assist the district
by restarting the smelters.
Tongkah Harbor’s best ground is now in
deep water, where Nos. 5 and G plants have
spent the last few happy months. While
finance is snug, the cold truth looks to be
that the shallow ground is nearly done;
otherwise two dredges would not be on the
.shunt to the Bang Tao patch, just secured
after paying £10,500 compensation for sur-
face rights. There the two plants are de-
clared to have 10 years’ profitable work
ahead—if they last so long—and they will
certainly do better there than working
already-dredged harbor wash. All five
plants have of late nosed into that sort of
stuff. Thanks to rich patches, or ground
missed formerly, the results of the year’s
campaign brought in sweet profits. Four
years’ results have worked out this way:—
1917. 1918. 1919. 1920.

Net profit .. £67,923 £118,920 £75,548 £90,664
Costs went up over a ha'penny per cub. yd.,
and that on a big turnover eats up cash.
What saved things was the exceptional mar-
ket for tin, the average obtained per ton of
oxide being £lB3 4s. 5d., against £l4B 12s. 2d.
in 1919. So the average profit per yd. was
about the same as in 1919. Tongkah started
the year with a I’, and L. balance of £97,321,
it netted £90,664 during the yfear, and so
was able to provide the £69,750 required for
the 9s. of divs. with the greatest ease. This
left, £118,235 undivided. At the balance only
£4797 was owing to outsiders, while there
were liquid assets totalling £125,975, made
up of .spares, stores, fuel, £36,090; sundry
debtors and stocks metal, £9S3Q; and cash
and securities, £80,046. The register is a
quarter-million shares of £1 each, so practi-
cally 10s. per share is in hand. The five
dredges stand in the books at £32,000, or
about one-third of the cost of one up-to-date
plant. The costs outlook, noto that the
dollar exchange is down, is for cheaper work,
with the chance of better-quality spares
being available for renewals. The clouds
in the sky are the want of news about the
ground left and the tricky state of the .metal
market. Tongkah’s record to date is 13,355
tons oxide sold for £1,624,708; divs. paid,
£585,000, or 78s. per share.
•
Though during the six months to June 30
last Kampong Kamunting’s two dredges won
48J tons less tin oxide than during the pre-
vious half, and despite, the fact that costs
per_ cub. yd., moved from just under sd. to
6.15 d., the co. made £lBOO more for share-
holders. That was because the tin market
had soared to unprecedented heights. Alto-
gether 914,400yd5. were treated for
tons oxide, .showing a recovery of ,911 b.
per yd. But whereas in the December half
each yard gave 16d. worth of metal, on a
slightly lower recovery the average for the
latest term was over 19d. Costs were up
chiefly because of labor troubles and more
expensive dredging necessaries: labor was so
troublesome in the matter of fuel supplies
that for a time manager A. J. King resorted
to expensive coal rather than risk missing
the £2OO profit per day which each dredge
was capable of earning in the record tin
market. During the half-year 7s. (£28,000)
was paid in divs., making a total for the 12
months of 12s. per share, equal to 60 p.c.
p.a. on paid capital. After this great per-
formance the co. closed its books with not a
penny owing and with reserves of £34,000.
A large wad of Kampong’s spare cash has
gone to help other Freeman concerns. At
the balance £31,730 was in War Loan and
cash, but £32,433 had been loaned to get
Asam Kumbang going, though* £31,250 of
that has since to take up f the 25,000
shares, at a premium of 55., over which the
co. had an option. Ulu Yam was also
being supported with a loan of £4OS3, at
8 p.c. p.a. interest.
Asam Kumbang (F.M.S.) is equipped
with a Ituwolt, dredge capable of treating
over 120,000yds. per month, but during the
half-year to June 30, last, owing to delays
in adjusting plant and because of an acute
shortage of labor, it averaged onlv a little
over 8< ,00(>yds. But the 522,400yd5. treated
gave 280 tons oxide—an average of over lib.
Per yd.—worth £45,348. Values in the high
tin market worked out at over 20fd. per yd.,
and, with costs at under there was a
splendid working protit of 10|d. After
writing off £lO,OlO for amortisation and de-
preciation and meeting office and general
exes, there remained £15,097 available for
shareholders. A first div. of Is. Od. was
passed out in July, followed by another for
a similar amount in October. A return of
Bs. per £1 share for a first year’s dredging
must be about a record.
General-manager Raleigh, having a 12
months’ engagement with Badak, is filling
in time trying to pick up a show to replace
T. W. Orton’s Jeneri Valley concession.
Raleigh’s report on that block shows its
absolute worthlessness. Of 80 bores put
down in four lines not one gave anything
better than a trace. Two of Wilson’s bores
re-opened gave no better result. So the
Badak mystery is still unsolved. Also
Raleigh got on to six bores sunk by Scar-
borough after Wilson and before Boadle,
and although Raleigh does not give precise
results they must have been very sick. Any-
how, Raleigh has surrendered all rights, re-
moved the plant and recovered the cash
sent to pay for the claim. With this £15,000
and £lO,OOO in hand in Melbourne the eo. has
altogether £25.000. besides plant which cost
£B5OO. So there is plenty available to pay
Board fees while a long hunt goes on for a
mine. Lawson’s Government is still follow-
ing up trails to ascertain how it was that
wrong over the show.
lMt. Monger whooped a bit the other day
over a rich return from the Proprietary
lease. As, however, the gojd was known to
have come from one of the small rich patches
occasionally struck on this unreliable field,
the market didn’t respond. The few cos. re-
maining on this line of country are a sorry
lot, and it would be better for all concerned
if they were put into liquidation. Parties of
two or three prospectors might do well here
and there for a time, but even that is
doubtful.
Boulder No. 1 is reported to have got hold
of something good in Carman’s leases on
Block 45, Hampton Plains. Crosscuts at
50ft. from two shafts 200 ft. apart have ex-
posed ore estimated to be worth from 14dwt.
to an oz. and to have a width ranging from
Oft. to 12ft. But in view of the field’s ex-
periences one must not be very sanguine that
the rich make will last down.
* * * *
Princess Royal (W.A.) has had another
reverse. This time it has had to abandon
its option on the Williamtown lease, at Ival-
goorlie,. because shareholders won’t pay calls.
There is said to be enough gold in the ore
blocked out to pay for the mine, but being
without capital or the prospect of getting
sufficient for future development, the Board
decided that it would be foolish to attempt
to carry on.
*** . *
“O.B.” : The report of the Devon meeting
held in Melbourne recently would lead any-
one without knowledge of the co.’s Westraliarj
mine to believe that calls can be done without
at an early date and that there is promise of
divs. If the directors really believe this and
wish investors to do so, too, they should not
hesitate to call in an expert of standing to
reoort on the property. One expert sent to
manage the show was so impressed that he
left within a week.

Blair Athol coal (Q.) continues to do
well ; for the half to Sept. 30, a net profit
of £0927 showed up and two sixpenny divs.
(together £5000) were paid. The past
year’s net profits showed over 33 p.c. on
paid capital. Liabilities at the balance
amounted to £1515, and liquid assets totted
up £BBB3. Blair Athol is producing from three
collieries, and though at present-its market
is entirely local, managing-director J. W.
Hetherington is seeking permission from the
Port Alma Harbor Board to erect an eleva-
tor there for bunkering purposes*, fy which
means he hopes to get some of the trade
that now goes to Newcastle. Not satisfied
with its local success, Blair Athol has in-
vaded N. S. Wales and is opening up a
property a couple miles from Mt. Victoria,
on the Blue Mountains. The co. secured
this area for £l5O cash and 15,000 fully-
paids (10s. each), payment to be made con-
ditionally on the coal proving marketable.
* * * *
A good deal of activity is being shown in
prospecting and opening up new coal seams
in the Rosewood district, just west of Ips-
wich (Q.). The coal occurs in the Walloon
measures, a newer formation than the
Ipswich steam coals. During the past 12
months two small collieries have been opened
within half-a-mile of Rosewood, by J. M.
Bruce and the Edenbank Coal Co. The
principal pit of the district, the Caledonia,
at Thagoona, was lately sold by Black
to the A.U.S.N. Co., which is increasing
production, largely for shipping. Negotia-
tions are at present under way to re-open
one of the old Walloon collieries, and when
the rate of royalty is settled the district
should have another pit. J. YV. Hettiering-
ton, ex-mayor of Brisbane and large owner of
Blair Athol and other coal interests, has been
boring just north of Rosewood, but has not
hit upon anything worth opening up; and
Piemen Bros., of Brisbane, put down two
bores handy to Walloon, but failed to pick up
the old YY alloon seam. This was the pioneer
seam of the district, and was worked just be-
hind the railway station.
That mighty Yank, Hoover, ought to be
recalled to the funeral of the Gt. Fitzroy
(Q. ), arranged by Bewick, Moreing and Co.
Hoover, the Baillieus, Billy Robinson and
\\. J. Boring all froze on the .show when it
came along from Philip Charley. London
caught the fever, except perhaps Harry Con-
ran. Various engineers all had a shot at
the mine, but the ore got siliceous, contents
fell off and mill returns panned out rottenly.
Before Gt; Fitzroy goes to the pack it pre-
sents a balance-sheet to Dec. 31, 1919, show-
ing a net loss of £135,782, despite £109,000
obtained from the realisation of assets. Of
the first-mortgage debenture debt of £BO,OOO
all but £24,133 has been paid off. In addi-
tion, sundry creditors for £14,666 await
settlement.

The plants of two more Vic. gold-mines
are to pass under the hammer. The whole
of the equipment at the Magdala, Stawell,
goes to the highest bidder at the end of this
week. Chiltern Valley unloads its belong-
ings, together with the “valuable gold-mining
leases” —if anybody wants them —a couple
of days before Christmas.

man has better credentials for the job. Like

issue he was neutral, holding that the ques-

The last N.T. Administrator was a horse-
doctor; the next will be a policeman. But
h lederic Charles Urquhart, of Queensland,
“® B . practical knowledge of the North
that Gurutli lacked; as long ago as 1882
he was a trooper on the Gregory River, and
during the subsequent 20 years he worked as
tar west as the Territory border and as far
north as Thursday Island. He has been Com-
missioner of Police since 1017, and the man
who likes a placid life would rather have a
job like that, even in Brisbane, than the
hazardous billet at Darwin. But the salary
is seductive, and presumably Urquhart knows
his own business best.
Died in London on Nov. 25, James Hart
Fawcett, one of the straightest and kindliest
of Australian mining-engineers. lie was
the first assayer on Broken Dili, and since
then he had been in the van of every Aus-
tralian rush worth mentioning, and had
experience in Spain and Mexico, the U.S.
and Italy. In 1903-4 he was general man-
ager of the Etruscan Copper Co., and
resigned because the directors in London
sub-edited his reports for market purposes.
Fawcett afterwards prosecuted the Etruscan
board for the slander necessary to explain
his resignation, and recovered damages. His
last, job was the examination of diamond-
iferous alluvial in South Africa, with Have-
lock Smith as offsider. There are thousands
of mining men who will be sorry for the
passing of this conscientious engineer, stead-
fast mate and kindly gentleman.
Toorak’s new member in the Vic,
Assembly, Dr. Argyle, was refreshing the
other day when leading a deputation from
the B.M.A. to Premier Lawson on the milk
supply. Fellow-worker A. J. Wood sug-
gested that suburban councils should be sub-
sidised if they would arrange for the delivery
of special milk for infants, and incidentally
lie mentioned Tal-
bot and Willes-
mere mil k. In-
stantly Argyle was
on his feet to make
it clear that he
was chairman of
the Willesmere
Milk Co., and was
not there to work
a point. His co.
would not take
any State help,
whatever was done
for councils. Some
politicians are not
nearly s o thin-
skinned. Hayseed,
for instance, has
been known to try
to shift a Ministry
partly because it
did not stretch a
point to give a
manure co. in
which Cocky is
interested a fac-
tory site on advan-
tageous terms.

Sydney's new
Lord Mayor.
The Pope has created little Paddy Mina-

of Parliament:
Mr. Minahan to move, That leave be given to
bring in a bill for the regulation of Two-up Schools.
Looks as if his Holiness appreciates a good
all-round man.
There were sad hearts in Northern West-
ralia when Neal Durack went over the hill.
Hurrying from an out-station in the Terri-
tory to greet his young wife and baby, who
were about to catch the southern boat at
\y yndham, Durack hit the Ord River run-
ning strongly and a quarter of a mile wide.
He decided to swim the dangerous crossing
rather than disappoint the wife, but half-
way over he sank and was seen no more.
A young man of snlendid physique, Durack
went through the Palestine and Svrian cam-
paigns as a lieutenant in the Light Horse
and was knocked at Gaza. His father, a
Kimberley pioneer, was killed by blacks.
Joe Beddall, who died in Sydney recently
had been 28 years with Lassetter’s. An
elderly naval man, he had seen service with
Australian detachments in South Africa and
China, and, although far over GO, he didn’t
like being left out of the bigger affair that
the Kaiser started. He tried many times
and essayed many devices to bluff the recruit-
ing-officers—including the sacrifice of his
whiskers and posing as his own nephew—
and then he only got as far as New Guinea.
All his efforts to reach Europe were unavail-
ing.
Obedient to party discipline, Aid. John Far-
rell seconded the resolution that Bill Lamber'•
should be Lord Mayor of Sydney, but there
was no more disappointed man in the
Council when the A.L.P. insisted on the
selection of William. Before that (hap-
pened Farrell had hones of collaring the
.job himself: but his pull with the executive
is not strong, nor has he ever been able
to command much personal support. A sus-
picion exists that his much-advert'sed anti-
pathy to returned soldiers was largely
assumed to gain the' favor of a particular
following : but if so it failed dismally of its
ignoble object.
• H. Bruford, who handed in his checks
on h rid ay, was Vic. Auditor-General for
years, and made his mark. As Parlia-
ment’s watchdog he spoke out, and occa-
sionally ruffled Ministers and high State
officials. While climbing upward he had to
serve as chief clerk in the Premier’s Depart-
ment under the impossible E. J. Thomas for
a while, but otherwise he had a pleasant
career. He was deputy-commissioner of
income-tax, and gave the Westralian Govern-
ment a hand to reorganise its civil service.
Irvine made him Auditor-General, but stipu-
lated that he should draw pension only on
the salary he was receiving previously (£759
a year). This embittered Bruford before
he retired, and he hung on to his job longer
than he might have done if there had been
no such ungracious condition. Lawson
adjusted the matter, and Bruford, after long
leave, resigned a little over,two years ago.
The memory of Col. Light, who fixed the
site of Adelaide in the face of great opposi-
tion, was “honored in silence” in the usual
fashion in the Town Hall last week, from a
silver bowl 150 years old presented for that
purpose half a century back. Governoi
W eigall, present at the ceremony for the first
time, was ingeniously worked in by Mou’don.
the Mayor of Adelaide. This way: Welling-
ton was Weigall’s great-grand-uncle, and
Light was the Duke’s “trusted scout and
adviser of camping- and halting-places.” lie
had been in the Navy, too, and commanded
the brig Rapid on his voyage to Australia.
> One result of Archbishop Kelly’s vis.t to
Rome is the pending appointment of a co-
adjutor, with, presumably, the right of suc-
cession. Archbishop Folding had as assistant
Dr. Davis; he was bishop of M'aitland
nominally, but was never in Maitland. Later
Roger Bede Vaughan came as coadjutor, with
the right of succession; and as archbishop
he made drastic changes. On Vaughan’s
death Dr. Moran, of Kilkenny, came as
archbishop. Later he was made Cardinal, on
which he got an assistant bishop, Dr. Hig-
gins, who later went to Rockhampton and
later still to Ballarat. Then the Cardinal
obtained as coadjutor with the right of
success.on the present archbishop, who had
spent most of liis life in the English College
at Rome.
One of the mourners at Montague Miller’s
funeral was a great-grandson. Before the
end came the old revolutionary wrote his
own obituary notice, which set forth that
h-s “long and painful illness” had been
“borne with atheistic fortitude derived from
the glory of materialistic philosophy.”
Five Brown brothers of Whittlesea (Vic.)
having come safely through the war, have
appl.ed for five adjoining blocks on the
Terrinallum Estate, South-Western District;
and as they want to give one another a hand,
they say, they have something better than a
fighting chance of getting what they are after.
Queensland has lost a fine young man by
the untimely death of James Baxter, the
State’s Rhodes scholar in 1910. A brilliant
youngster, he won his way by the scholarship
route to the Uni., gathering in the Lilley
medal for first place in the scholar! p list,
a Junior pass with honors in every
a Foundation scholarship, a record pass in
third-year engineering, and, finally, the
Rhodes. He was captain of the ’Var-
sity football team, and a full blue in
cricket, despite an injured eye. But sick-
ness prevented the lad from completing his
Oxford course, and the end came on Dec. 4.
Two old S. Australians have died at a dis-
tance. John Adam Fergusson was a popular
soldier in the ’seventies; his brother was
State Governor, and his sister wife of Bishop
Kennion. He has long been resident in
England. J. 11. Boothby, who died in Vic-
toria, was the last survivor of the 15 child-
ren of the long-ago S.A. Judge who became
crotchety at the end and had to be “removed”
from the Bench by Parliament. Adelaide is
still full of Boothbys ; Guv the novelist was
a grandson. J. 11., just dead at 79, was a
pastoral export and for years inspector in
Victoria for Dalgety and Co.
Related of the late Henry Gyles Turner
that after the bank crash of 1)3 he went for
a refresher in the country. He was not
over prosperous-looking—as manager of the
Commercial he had been rather hard hit —
and it happened during a deluge that his
coach dropped him at a wayside pub where
he was beleaguered for 24 hours. It was a
dim little place with a dim population, and
Henry hadn’t a favorite author to make
him forget his surroundings. After about
an hour of grunting at one another one of
his co-travellers proposed a game of cards,
and looking up innocently at Turner said :
“Let’s play banker.” At this Turner sud-
denly shot erect. “Play banker!” he moaned.
Then pointing to his dingy clothes he added:
“I’ve been playing banker for 20-odd years,
and look at me now !”

ment (1594-99), and who had his first taste
of Ministerial office under Graham Berry
40 years ago, is still about and active. It
was he who spoiled a joke which Turner

to play off on “Admiral’’ It. T. Vale, at a
Cabinet meeting just before the arrival of

From the Federal Gallery:—*
Mrs. Ryan is a charming little woman, with more
than average intelligence, but in spite Of what
“Rinder” may say (B. 9/12/’2O), she isn’t shoving
her man, because his own energy and ambition supply
all the propulsion that is required. Casual observers
of Ryan, seeing him bundled up on the back Opposi-
tion bench, would regard him as a perfect picture of
laziness and indifference. But you have to spot
him outside, keeping late hours with a pen, or scour-
ing the library, to realise that Tomjo is undoubtedly
alive. The fact that Mrs. Ryan spends a lot of her
time in the House and the Speaker’s Gallery means
nothing more than a wife’s admiration for the
growing celebrity of her husband. Other members'
wives are equally diligent. Mrs. Groom is often
there to inspire her Littleton to outbursts of superflu-
ous verbiage, but no one could claim that she is the
maker of his destiny. To achieve the Groom kind of
success, which is the genius to cling to anything
\yith a tiptop salary, Littleton has never needed
any persuasion. In fact, he has gone baldheaded
for offis at every opportunity, and perhaps, barring
Hughes, has now a longer, record of Cabinet rank
than any other man in the Reps.
Ernie Eeid, manager of Tasmania’s new
State Insurance Department, is a son of the
late Alex. Reid, who was the Island’s highly
efficient Under-Treasurer for a good part of
last century and some of this, and who died
practically in the harness that successive
Administrations insisted upon his wearing
for long after he would have joyously kicked
himself free.
“Ajax” : Another Premier of S. Aus. still
above the daisies (B. 2/12/’2O) is Henry
Bull Templer Strangways, and he was as
able as any of them. An English barrister,
he emigrated in the ’fifties, was elected to
the Assembly in 1858, became Attorney -
Genera], Minister of Lands and Premier —
the last in '"1868. Among other things he
supervised the fitting out of the McDouall
Stuart expeditions, and helped to initiate
the State railway system, but his chief work
was the passing of the Strangways Act,
which gave a great fillip to land settle-
ment. The old gentleman (he was born in
1832) returned to England in 1871, and last
year he sent an autographed portrait to
Speaker Coneybeer of the S.A. Assembly to
show that Croweaterland was still in his
thoughts.
Baronet Rupert Clarke’s fine new place
at Potts Point (Sydney) is called Kismet.
A cherished story in the family collection is
about “Big” Clarke, Rupert’s grandfather.
Many years ago he proposed to pay a visit
to his Tasmanian properties, and had taken
his passage in the steamer Britomart. Just
before .the hour of sailing he accidentally
met his " old friend Captain Clinch, then
in command of s.s. Swordfish. Clinch
begged Clarke to sail with him, and offered
to send to the Britomart for his luggage.
The offer was accepted, Clarke went on
hoard the Swordfish, and the steamers sailed
almost together. The Swordfish arrived
i the Britomart was not again heard
of. 'V

WINES
“Exul”: At the A.T.N.A. exam, held
recently at Sydney Hospital a particularly
charming young thing successfully employed
woman’s ancient weapon against the exam-
ining doctors.- As she came to each, before
any questions' could be asked, she burst into
tears. Of course nervous beauty in distress
could not be withstood by chivalry, even
though represented by staid benedicks; so
she was soothed with reassuring words.
However, she refused to be completely com-
forted until question-time for her was nearly
up and the opportunity gone for putting
posers. Each examiner flattered him-
self that his benign countenance had caused
him to be selected as a comforter, but when
notes were compared afterwards and it was
found that all the male examiners had been
THE EFFECTIVE MUZZEE.

treated alike, suspicions were aroused that
fair Niobe was not as artless as she appeared.
It was also significant that she was dry-
eyed and self-possessed in the presence of
the matron-examiners.

“The Oldest Inhabitant” : A 114 oz. nugget,
found a few days ago by two miners at
Hobby’s Yards, 30 miles from Bathurst
(N.S.W.), was too large for the local jewel-
ler’s scales, so it was weighed at a saddler’s
shop next door. This happened in William-
street, Bathurst. Some 70 years ago the
first big N. S. Wales nugget was brought
into the same street by Dr. Kerr from Meroo,
and was so large that it had to be broken
up before it could be weighed on the scales
of the local chemist, Josiah Parker. Next
door to Parker’s was afterwards established
an inn known as The First Nugget. These
first and last big lumps were scaled within
150 yards of each other.
“Country Ped.”: “Cost’s” par. (B.
2/12/’2O) on the perils that await a mem-
ber of the male sex, of whatever color, in
regard to the uncorroborated varns of strange
female youngsters, reminds me of the warn-
ing one of my headmasters gave me when I
was starting on my teach-
ing career. “If you ever
have to punish a girl by
keeping her in after
school," said -he, “make
some excuse to keep a boy
in too. ' I’ll tell-you why.
My first country school
was away up. in the
ranges of the north-east
of Victoria. In.it were
two girls about M who
knew more than most
women about some tilings.
One night I kept both of
them in after school for
> about half an houivvßoth
• were pretty wild because
I made them do. as I
wanted them to:. Next
morning I was facing
two angry mothers, who
wanted to know what I
had been doing to their
daughters. I pleaded not
guilty. No good. They
brought the two girls
before me, and they both
swore that I had grossly
interfered with them.
Next thing was an in-
quiry by the District In-
spector. lie, believing
me, put the youngsters
through a searching cross-
examination, and they
only faltered when he
asked them to give him
the date. Then thev broke
down and confessed that
they had spitefully made
up the yarn on the way home from school.”
As a teacher of some years’ standing, I know
that, for romancing, girls and boys leave
I)e Rougemont out of sight. I have been
glad to find very few Judges who don’t well
know it, too.

On the relative importance of manslayers:
Smith, the Tasmanian police-trooper who got seven
years (reduced by Cabinet to three months) for
shooting a suspected fish-poacher when he merely
meant to disable'the boat, had had luck in being
indicted at all. He was a victim of the curious
social prejudice that exists against policemen, not
in Australia alone, but in all English-speaking coun-
tries. When a private citizen of some tonnage plugs
a lawbreaker, or supposed lawbreaker, who declines
to heave to, the odds against prosecution are at
least 10 to one; against imprisonment they are about
a -million to one. Examples can be quoted, and
the Judge who sentenced Smith shouldn’t need to be
reminded of one—it happened on the Leonora gold-
field not long after Mr.- Ewing had ceased to be “the
member for the Great Australian Bight.” There had
been some gold-stealing at the Tower Hill claim,
and two Johnnies of the mine staff decided to do
s«jm| detective work. They laid in a stock of iron-
mongery and wet goods, arranged a rendezvous with
the watchman, ahd ensconced themselves after dinner
in. their listening-post, hoping that the marauders
would disclose themselves during the night. About
one in the morning two men came from the direction
of the township and manoeuvred suspiciously about
the mine buildings. Greatly excited the officials
charged them and they ran for it; one got clean
away, but the other was brought down by a bullet and
died on the spot. He was ‘ certainly trespassing and
had been fruitlessly ordered to stop. Still, the person
who shot him had no legal or moral right to resort
to the revolver —it was an act of folly committed in
an ebullient moment. But being a silvertail with
any amount of social and political pull, he was
never brought to trial. It: would have been different
had he been a policeman named Smith.

“Whitehall”: The Sydney Athenaeum
Club has _ finally given up the ghost after
lingering in (irticulo mortis for many years.
It was formed in imitation of the great Pall
Mall institution, and it failed largely because
many of N. S. Wales’s intellectuals avoided
it, and most of the others were not considered
sufficiently clubbable or something. Never
shall I forget Norman Lindsay’s look of
despair on learning that a misguided admirer
had put him up for the place. It didn't
occur to him in the first shock apparently
that he could cope with the situation by
avoiding it. Henry Lawson was never
elected. On the other hand, it was full of
auctioneers, departmental managers, floor-
walkers and solicitors, who played a .spirited
game of poker deep into the night and drank
much whisky and ate masses of beef and
pickle sandwiches. Toby Barton, “Hop,”
B. R. Wise, Archibald and —very occasionally
—James Edmond did something to keep up
the illusion that it was a haunt of high think-
ing and bright sayings, but for the most part
it was indistinguishable intellectually from
the N. S. Wales Club, which is a hard thing
to say of any resort. During the epoch
when the club was relatively prosperous and
a tenant of a cockroach-infested building
belonging to Lord Rosebery in Castlereagh-
street, distinguished literary visitors were
sometimes entertained at dinner. In this
way I came to hear H. B. Irving tell a
good yarn. On being elected to the London
Athenaeum he drifted in one day to look
round. He asked a man in the hall, appa-
rently a waiter, where the librarv was.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
“Is it a sunrise or a sunset?"
“Sunset. I know the artist. He never got
up in time to paint a sunrise."
“Come with me,” was the answer; “I’ll
show it to you.” He took Irving over the
whqle. enormous building, explaining each of
its points in detail. When they reached the
hall once more Irving thanked him. “Don’t
mention it, my dear sir,” said the stranger;
“I’ve enjoyed it. It is now 27 years since
I first joined the club and you’re the first
member who has ever spoken to me.” One of
the good points about the Sydney Athenaeum
was that it did not suffer from stand-offish-
ness, as the Union Club used to and as the
Melbourne Club still does. The remaining
members have been taken in by the Imperial
Service Club, which is also a friendly and
democratic sort of place.

“To Po”: On a Repat. committee I struck
the case of a Digger who arrived home
healthy (outwardly) and hopeful. He took
up land, worked it splendidly, married a
girl and abandoned his pension. This hal-
cyon state of affairs
went on for two
years; then, one
night his wife was
awakened by his
screams. He spends
his time now sitting
in a corner of his
kitchen, pleading with
the unfortunate
woman to keep with-
in sight. The doctor
calls it “deferred
shell-shoe k,” and,
when asked what
really is the matter,
replies, “God knows!” There are things
about the human brain that no one else
will ever know.

From the quarter-deck :
The reason for the sudden flood of rumor last
week on the subject of Commodore Dumaresq’s
approaching retirement from the R.A.N. was his
appointment to one of the two naval A.D.C.-ships
to the King which recently became available. This
means that he is marked for quick promotion under
certain circumstances. But it has always been hard
to get a good type of R.N. officer for the Australian
Navy—the ambitious sheering off it altogether and
only those with a taste for a life of suburban frivol-
ity being really keen about it —and latterly things
have got worse. Political interference and an ever-
increasing tendency to cut the service down to the
bone are the chief objections amongst serious-
minded sailors. Dumaresq is one of them, and there
is no doubt he is fed up. The politicians are hard
at work making the R.A.N. “a comic-opera show,”
and, till they reform, all those senior officers who
refuse to be associated with comic-opera methods
are going to give it a wide berth.
“Old Red’’: Fitzgerald, Mayor of Sydney,
is "my Lord” ; lie took to the “honor,” and
in his gentle little way even crowed over it,
as a rooster takes to a dunghill and crows
over it. To Fitzgerald succeeds Bill Lambert.
My Lord Fitzgerald was a Caucus man, of
course; Lambert is more—he is the direct
nominee of the A.L.P., the champion of “the
proletariat,” the arch-enemy of rank and
privilege. What, then, is Lambert going to do
about it? Is he, too, going to accept the
title, or will he intimate that during his
term it is to be held in abeyance? From his
point of view the youths who perform with
a broom and a pan in the streets are of equal
social standing with himself. Shall he. Bill,
be my Lord, while they, Tom and Dick, are
mere blokes?
Conan Doyle’s earliest experience of the
occult was a very mild one, with a literary
flavor. He visited a lonely inn in Switzer-
land, was told that it is utterly snowbound
and unapproachable for three months every
winter, and planned out a story which should
isolate some strongly antagonistic characters
there, and Work up to tragedy. A week
later he was in Paris, bought a volume of
Maupassant, and found the tale, almost
exactly as he had devised it. Of course, the
two novelists had been set on the same
obvious train of thought by the same scene.
But:
The perfectly marvellous thing is that in that
short journey I should have chanced to buy the one
book in all the world which would prevent my
making a public fool of myself; for who would
ever have believed that my work was not an imita-
tion ? I do not think that the hypothesis of
coincidence can cover the facts. It is one of
several incidents in my life which have convinced
me of spiritual interposition, of the promptings of
some beneficent force which tries to help us where
it can.
But it would be a still more perfectly mar-
vellous thing if accidents always landed us
in the soup and never helped us out of it.
“Karee”: “Thirty One’s” yarn (B.
2/12/’2O) of the way Diggers received com-
pliments reminds me of how Sergeant Mac-
Intyre came to lose the D.C.M. The Sarg.
was a dag and no respecter of persons. He
crimed his own father for giving him back-
chat on picket, and put dad in the clink
himself. While out scouting near Mersa
Matruh with a couple of “Composite” Light-
horsemen he stumbled, in the dark, on a
large Bedaween camp. The denizens mis-
took him for an army corps and imshied on
the toot. Mac. and his cobbers came back
with several hundred camels, donks and other
smells, the arrival of which nearly caused
a panic in our own mob. It rained like
Belgium that night, and when Mac. found
that he’d missed cook-house and that his
blankets had been souvdnired, his language
pauperised description. In the midst of
his fifthly, an inquiry for Sergeant Maclntyre
pierced the gloom. “What the hell d’yer
want with Maclntyre”? yelled the infuriated
owner of that name. After a shocked pause
the voice remarked that the Tommy General
was intensely grateful to Mac. and his mates,
and that the sergeant would be recommended
for the D.C.M. “Who wants your blankety
blank D.C.M.?” roared the hero of the ex-
ploit. “What I want is my blankets, which

WHY SPRING FELL FLAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Spring is gone. I have not seen
Its fairies tripping on the Block,
Arcadians in grey and green,
The happy flapper in a frock
So dainty that the breezes fret
It like the smoke of cigarette.
I’ve seen no pixies of the pave
The season deck with flower and plume;
No slim, entrancing elves that wave
Their gossamers like wattle bloOm ;
But only staid, trim maids arrayed
In Autumn costunieli tailor-made, .
Not like a garden poppy strewn . ; ij.
And scented as an Eden fair
Has been the Block at afternoon.
So Spring came not to me this- year.
Curse -on the greedy profiteer
Who made the dear ones all too dear!
VICTORIA.

“Gagi” : All eyes focus on me immediately
I enter the Public Library. Hardly do I
settle down to an interesting book when the
hairy gentleman opposite begins to scowl.
Vicious mutterings stab my ears from front,
rear and both sides. Highly-strung students
of the feminine persuasion pack up then-
books and go. Attendants hover about
menacingly, and returned soldiers with a
touch of shell-shock wince intermittently or
jump up cursing and run for it. Can any-
one tell me a way of cracking peanuts
silently?
BURNISHED BRASS.
“Mrs. Smith-Jones is very polished, isn't
she?"
“Oh, brilliantly! Her conversation always
reflects on someone.”
lorts” : There is no engine of spasmodic
tyranny, malice, petty revenge and blackmail
like a law which is loaded with so many
hundreds of penalties and impossible restric-
tions that it falls into desuetude, yet is always
lying round vvaiting to be brought down
with a stunning crash on somebody who
incurs the dislike of a bureaucrat or informer
and who won’t buy immunity. If the Sunday
Observance Act of Charles 11. had been
applied honestly for a month at any time
the gaols wouldn’t have held the defendants
or the Bank of N. S. Wales the fines, and
the biggest city would hardly have held the
riot. _ So it was always applied with dis-
crimination—when somebody wanted to take
it out of somebody. The N.S.W. Land Bill
and Profiteering Bill are of that sort. The
sign above some door or other—possibly a
very obscure one down a back street—will
be “Discrimination Supplied Here.” As a
rule, the place where the article is supplied
looks rather like a small eating-house or
laundry, but there are always means of find-
ing it, just as one can find a drink on Sun-
da.v. When discrimination is in full blast
it isn’t a case of one man being allowed
to steal a horse while another may not look
over the hedge. Rather one man may steal
an elephant while it isn’t safe for another
to look over the morning paper.
“616”: Away out on the Sinai Peninsula,
where sand dunes
stretched from horizon to
horizon, and there were
no visitors barring a camel
team which called once a
week with rations, life
was duller than it had
ever been. Aching for
distraction, the Diggers
searched for and at last
found it in the scarabs.
When two of these beetles
met they mostly fought
to the death, the winner
cutting the loser to pieces
with his sharp, crab-like
claws and making a meal
of him. Then would the
victor be seized and an
advertisement circulated
that Trooper So-and-So
had a champion who
would meet any bug of
his size and weight. The
betting over these con-
tests would be heavy,
and I’ve often seen a
hun d r e d-piastre note
turned down for a notable %
performer. As against'
which an offer of two
cigarettes (and issues at
that) was often sufficient
to secure him a minute after. That was a
land where smokes were exceeding scarce.
* * * *
“Mr. Ocky”: This is the authentic story
(affidavit enclosed) of my friend Bertie, who
was with us in France. On his first Blighty
leave he met Gertie in a Piccadilly shop. She
carried a music-case. It contained “The Lost
Chord” and “The Holy City.” Gertie had
just _ returned from her music lesson, and
Bertie extracted the reluctant admission that
her teacher, Mine. Oppityervitch, predicted
for her a dazzling career. Gertie was an
orphan, and Bertie saw her several times
after that at the neat little flat which she
inhabited. Before leaving for France he
insisted on paying for the following music -
term. On his next leave he lavished more
wealth on the prima donna in embyro. As
she had no piano of her own, he never really
heard her sing. But what of that? He
would have years to listen to her glorious
top notes. The crash came when Bertie
obtained his third leave, which he kept a
secret from Gertie, intending to give her a
great surprise. But he got the surprise. It
was in the Strand, very late at night. Arm
in arm with another Aussie was Gertie. In
a voice that recalled the last agonies of a
consumptive heifer she was gaily carolling
“Australia Will Be There.”
* * * *
“8.T.”: When I think of cases of this
sort I don’t know whether to be glad because
of the public’s heart or mad because of its
head. An elderly woman took a cottage at
Port Melbourne. She had a son, a strangely
pathetic object, who went into the city daily,
and simply stood about. He became a
familiar object in Swanston, Flinders and
Elizabeth streets, standing rigidly at a veran-
dah-post, or with his back to a shop front,
staring mutely before him, woeful, helpless-
looking. How the woman and her son lived
was a problem that worried their neighbors;
but the mother toiled not neither did she
spin, yet her rent was paid regularly and she
seemed to want for nothing. Eventually the
Law interfered with the pathetic mute, and
then it was discovered that he was really a
valuable source of income. He did not beg,
he spoke to no one, he just stood hopelessly in
the street, and the charitably disposed put
money into his pockets, or thrust it into his
hands. He sometimes came home with as
much as five pounds in silver in his pockets,
the mother admitted. “I would have been
independent if they had left my boy with me
another six months,” she wailed. She already
had £7OO in the Savings Bank.
* * * *
“Costs” on “the other branch” :
A Sydney K.C. swore the other day that even
under favorable circumstances he did not earn
more than £2200 per annum. Yet he has been
one of the best-known N. S. Wales men on the
Common Law side for the past 15 years. Con-
sider his position. He must deduct from hia uncer-
tain income travelling expenses on circuit, rent of
chambers, clerk’s salary and cost of lighting and
firing, telephone, law-books and journals, stationery
and many other items. An average law library costs
£lOOO, and it is difficult to furnish chambers under
£lOO. His is no eight-hour job. The man with
any sort of practice and the intention to retain
it must work by night as well as by day. Compare
such a case with that of a decently-paid member
of the salariat, and it is not difficult to see why even
a prosperous K.C. grab's a judgeship, while the
smaller fry rush Crown prosecutorships and Parlia-
mentary draughtsmen’s jobs. Very few ever become
K.C.’s with good practices, and even fewer draw
a steady and lucrative wage from the Crown Law
Office. The majority live in comparative idleness
either on their incomes or as dependents on their
relations, or in shabby-genteel poverty unillumined
by prospects” of any description. Success at the
Par, as at so many other intellectual callings,
demands more than the capacity to assimilate know-
ledge and pass examinations. The chief require-
ANYTHING TO OBLIGE.
“ Haven’t I met you before some time?”
“I don’t think so.”
"Well, can I meet you, somewhere now?”
nient is that rare quality which we call individu-
ality. It is not needed for growing wheat or wool,
and it can be dispensed with in many profitable
city jobs. It is a real tragedy at a time like this when
the land is being neglected and the useful callings
generally are unpopular, when good bricklayers are
scarce and a decent carpenter is almost unobtain-
able, that numbers of able-bodied men in the prime
of life, on whose education thousands of pounds
have been spent, should be frittering away their
lives in expectation of that which can never be.
They are the slaves of a fetich, and the community
suffers as well as themselves.
* * * *
“CP.”: No difficulty was experienced in
h ranee in finding men willing to submit to
transfusion of blood. I was in hospital soon
after the commencement of the big push.
A Scottie was brought in with portion of his
leg blown away. He had been lying out for
some hours before being picked up by
stretcher - bearers,
and had lost a
great quantity of
blood in conse-
quence. The day
following his arri-
va 1 the hospital
doctor called for
volunteers willing
to give a pint of
blood. In the first
ward he visited he
got five. The
most healthy-look-
ing of the crowd, a
big Aussie, who
had been badly
burnt by gas exter-
nally but had now
practically recov-
ered, was chosen,
and tapped right
away, the liquid
being taken from
his right fore-arm.
He was rewarded
with special diet,
two weeks in a
convalescent camp, and 10 days’ leave to
Blighty, and he would have taken it on once
a .month at the price.
* * * #
“Hamer”: The public has been learning
surprising things about party funds, but the
half has not been told. There are men in
Sydney who contribute to the war chests of
more than one party. They are hard-headed
business men, and presumably regard the
practice as commercially profitable. During
the conscription campaigns some of these
worthies publicly declared for national ser-
vice and subscribed heavily under the rose
for the purpose _of defeating it. A man I
know was unofficial organiser /of an employers’
anti fund for which large subscriptions
were obtained from men notoriously hostile
to Labor. The Labor campaigners never
bad so much money at their disposal as they
bad when Paunch publicly shouted for con-
scription and privately intrigued to defeat it.
One employer, challenged upon his duplicity,
made the plausible defence that, as a citizen’
he believed that conscription should be
carried ; but as a partner in a city firm lie
believed that conscription would disrupt their
business. So citizen Jekyll dropped his con-
tribution into one plate and trader Hyde
dropped his into the opposition vehicle, and
one guinea proceeded to call its recent
neighbor a liar and a traitor.
“Coot” : The recently-issued Index to the
Commonwealth Statutes (1901-1919) con-
tains this pearl of unconscious humor:—
Robbery, losses by—see War Times Profit Tsj
Assessment.
*■* * *
The Age the other day spoke of Walter
Kirby, tenor, as singing popular ballads and
“germs” of comic opera. It went one better
years ago when it told of a local business
man, whose little weakness as a Lothario was
widely recognised, as “Mr. W , the well-
known tenor sinner.”
* * * *
The genius that shows itself in a minute
attention to detail distinguished the ground-
work of certain gentlemen of leisure at
Hampton (Vic.). Seeing a new bank being
built they thoughtfully inspected the pre-
mises one Sunday, removed a few bricks
from what is to be the outer wall of the
strong-room, filled the cavity with sand, and
applied a thin veneer of cement. Unfor-
tunately a keen-eyed contractor noticed the
alteration, and some misapplied brain-sweat
was wasted.
“Bok”: “Ivopai” mentions one reason why
talented teachers are leaving the Vic. Educa-
tion Department. Here’s another. Jabb has
been in the department for 18 years. He is
an M.A. of Melbourne Uni. and has other
qualifications. Pie saw two years’ service
abroad (his wife went into business to keep
the home fires burning) and gave up £239
per annum to take Gs. per day. In France
he was chosen for. teaching mathematics, and
he was kept busy instructing all the way
home on the transport. Jibb was eligible for
khaki but didn’t go. He is not a University
man. Until the other enlisted he was junior
to Jabb. On June 30 Jibb’s salary was £216.
On July 1 it jumped to £384. Jabb’s is
£324. In effect Jibb, by not enlisting, gets
five years’ seniority to Jabb. One could under-
stand it if both men were employed by the
nohle Sydney Municipal Council, but the AUc.
Education Department is popularly supposed
to set its standards higher.
* * * *
“Topo”: Queer thing, human nature. A
Collins-street surgeon was brought up to our
township the other day, and it cost a hundred
guineas to get him. His job was over, and he
was “stopping one” in our pub with the blub-
bering husband —blubbering with gratitude.
Just when he was saying “Have another?” in
came Backblock Bill. “Is there any
doctor in this place?” he asked, and added
“My dawg’s sufferin’ ’ell.” “Where is he?”
asked Collins-street, and disappeared with
Bill. Dashed if he and the local doctor didn’t
fuss over Bill’s mongrel, take it up to the
HOW IT IS SPREAD.
“My friends speak the truth about me.”
“Yes. And then your enemies tell it to
everybody else.”
surgery in a car, chloroform it, operate, and
fix things up ! Bill yanked out his last pay
cheque, saying, “I’ll fix any balance later.”
Collins-street tossed it back, remarking, “Our
fee is three beers.” When Bill reached the
pub with the profession, he made it 23. I
drank one of them. Both doctors skited like
kids about their work on the dog; in mixed
company neither ever refers to his work in
saving mere human life.
THE LADYE FAYRE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She wrote a book did the Ladye Fayre
With golden hair
And high-bred air;
And part she told was a story true,
And part she told was a legend new;
And if she sullied the sleeping dead
They cared no whit for the things she said;
And some she harried would scorn reply,
And some would scream “’Tis a shameless lie!”
But gold came in to the Ladye Fayre,
Good printer’s gold that would match her hair,
And she laughed to think that a man should care,
Should wince if she stripped the heart-strings bare —
The Ladye Fayre!
She wrote a Book did the Ladye Fayre
With golden hair
And high-bred air ;
It told of wives who forgot their vows,
And hummed a song of a wayward spouse,
And though the tale was as false as Hell,
It smelled so rank with a fearsome smell
That people read it and sighed “Ah, well!”
And the poison spread, nor was hard to sell;
And gold came in to the Ladye Fayre,
I\ ho loved red gold as a potent snare
That drew good things to her gilded lair—
The Ladye Fayre!
She wrote a book did the Ladye Fayre
With golden hair
And high-bred air;
And when she printed she smiled with glee
And said “I have colfined Decency,
Have banned sweet Beticence hence for aye
And flung foul mud in the face of Day;
And what folk hid as a shame to tell
1 have grubbed it forth and exhumed the shell
Of a foetid past. But my gains were rare;
And the printer said as he gave my share,
‘lt is due to you and your olden flair
That you reap your wheat as you sowed your tare,
O Ladye Fayre !’ ”

"'STRUTFT, IF THIS IS A MIRAGE,
I’M A GONER.”
“Baal-gammon” : Macleod, whom “R.H.A.”
speaks of, was a good breaker. He knew how to
month a colt, and that is where most present-day
breakers fail. When Macleod was breaking at Car-
pentaria Downs he kept his hand in on Sundays by
teaching the crocodiles to lead to water. He was
a born breaker all right.
“Nardoo”: “T.C.J.’s” narrative (B.
4/H/’2O) reminds me of an experience I had on a
station in the Mitchell district (Q.). About 40
blacks were camped on the creek, and one night
there was to be a corroboree. I went down to the
camp with a half-caste stockman to have a look at
it. Arriving a little early, and as the bucks had
not finished painting themselves for the performance,
I went over to the playground (an open space with
a painted post in the centre) and sat down to await
events. Then the gins and lubras started yabbering
and pointing excitedly at me and I began to wonder
what was wrong. The king ambled up and explained.
“S’cuse me,” he courteously remarked, “but will
you go over that ’nother side? This is where the
ladies sit.”
“C.X.C.”: The dispute between “Steve
Hart” and “A.R.W.” is not the first that has arisen
over eucalypts. The Gippsland stringy bark (E.
eugenioides) is as different from the common stringy-
bark (known for short as E. macrorrhyncha) as each
is from the stringybark of N. S. Wales. Messmate
is not unlike a stringy and goes by that name in
Tasmania. In districts only a few miles apart the
cider-gum (E. yuinni) is identified as the swamp-
gum, river-gum and white-gum; while S. Aus.
white-gum is N. S. Wales ironbark and yet neither
is the Westralian white-gum (E. redunca). The term
blue-gum has been differently applied in every State
—in Vic. to E. globulus; in W.A. to E. megacarpa ;
in S.A. to E. leucoxylon; and in N.S.W. to E. saligna.
Gippsland red-gum (E. tereticornis) is not the red-
gum of S. Aus. (E. rostrata) nor of W.A. (E. calo-
phglla), but it is the blue-gum of Queensland.
if
“Carno” : Recent reference (B. 14/10/’2O)
to “messmate tea,” with which a persistent ulcerat-
ing sore was healed, is explained by the fact that
messmate leaves contain a chemical body known as
a glucoside. This body is a bacterial poison, being
Nature’s protection furnished to the plant itself
against wounds, from which vegetable as well as
animal organisms may suffer. Hence, when applied
to an ulcerating sore its first action would be to
attack the bacterial organisms, such as staphylococci
or streptococci, which were the cause of the ulcera-
tion ; and upon these being killed or rendered incap-
able of doing any harm, the wound would heal auto-
matically. The commonest glucoside is salicin,
which is present in the bark of the common willow-
tree. When the tree is injured, as by an incision
made in its trunk, the resinous gum containing the
salicin flows out and plugs up the cut, thus prevent-
ing any organisms from gaining a footing. Cases
of such natural protection are common in Nature.
“Alex.”: I can testify to two cats having
been struck by lightning (B. 25/11/’2O) ; I saw the
tragedy myself. It happened on Turkey station,
Gladstone (Q.). A dry storm was in progress and
two Toms were discussing the right of private pro-
perty in Maria, who listened coyly to the argument
—she was in the far corner of the milking-shed.
Came a flash, and the disputants fell to rise no
more. Maria crept from beneath the floor of the
barn two days later, with a scared look in her eyes
and a badly singed tail.
“5.N.0.”: “Dido” (B. 21/10/’2O) curses
the red bullock. I’ve got one or two left for the
black mule. It was Nigger who made a mess of
our farrier’s nose and teeth. It was Satan who
kicked a reinforcement driver back to Blighty, after
being on the donk. lines for only 10 minutes. It
was Lizzie (also of black complexion and soul)
who in a fury chewed all the hair off my mare’s
tail. The morning after our last pack stunt the
stray mules that had to be collected from the fields
round Hamel were all black. Black mules ate the
most rope, rolled in the stickiest mud, sang at the
most awkward times, got stuck in the most shell-
holes, and invented more foul language than any
other o’-var.ism on any front in any war.

“Coringa”: The bush has some queer
death-traps A neighbor once hunted for his horse
for days without success.
Someone found the nag,
nearly done, hung up by the
neck in a scrub-vine strong
as a ship’s cable. It had
put its head through a looped
vine and twisted round and
round till it was nearly
throttled. Another colt laid
down to sleep alongside a
tree which was bent over
nearly horizontally 3ft. from
the ground. The colt had
wriggled round under the tree,
and was found there dead,
though a wriggle back of a
few degrees would have freed
it. A reversal of the action's
by which animals get into these fixes would generally
save them, but the} 7 seldom go astern. Anyway,
those that are found dead don’t.

“Moscow”: “Mac” (B. 18/11/20) says
that sugar ’possums are the only animals he knows
that build nests in trees. All ’possums do when a
hollow tree is not available. I have found both the
ring- and brush-tailed varieties in nests which were
certainly not built by any bird. By the way, is
this a record ? Some years ago I came across a
mother ’possum and three youngsters about as
large as full-grown rats in the same nest near
Black Rock (Vic.). I had a very lively quarter of
an hour in the scrub before I caught the three
infants. Did they all belong to the same family, or
were they merely boarded out to the old lady by a
kindhearted Department for Neglected Ringtails?
“Coringa”: Let not “Mypharry” be dis-
couraged by “T.A.R.’s” home-made ’bacca recipe.
Here’s the prescription on which my dad fixed up
his weed 30 years ago. Soak the dried leaf in
treacle water till it’s tough enough to remove the
larger ribs. Add more treacle and a dash of rum,
drain, roll up in hessian tightly; untie one end of
the clothes-line when the missus isn’t looking, and,
hanging back with all your weight on the line,
wind it round the roll. Tie the ends tightly and
lay by for a wfeek or two —the longer the better.
P-S.- Keep a plug of bought stuff for chronic weed-
hummers, or the missus will never get the clothe 3
dry.
“Bouragi”: I agree with “Don Mac” (B.
25/11/’2O) that the Gulf Papuans are not skilled
archers. I had opportunities of seeing them at work
in earnest in the Purari delta years ago, and am
thankful to ray that, as far as “aimed shooting”
goes, they were mugs. The great strength of the
Gulf bows makes it impossible for a man to send an
aimed shot any distance. All the archers I have seen
ONE FOR UNCLE.
“Uncle, what game is it men play when
one takes a long pole, rubs some white
stuff on the end of it, pokes a white
hall around the table, and then lifts up
one leg and says ‘damn'?"
at work use a backward lurch of the upper part
of the body to aid the drawing arm, almost going
down on the right knee. They get plenty of distance
this way, but no accuracy. Casualties in their
scraps were infrequent owing to the long ranges.
The hand-to-hand fighters of the Binandele, with
their three-foot stone clubs, were much more dan-
gerous opponents. Still, when it hit, the arrow
got home. In one of Governor Macgregor’s expedi-
tions against the raiding Tugeri, in the ’nineties,
half-a-dozen native police in a whaleboat got into a
willing scrap with a big canoe party of the invaders
who made a break past them down a river. When
the blizzard had passed, old Corporal Anthony, who
was in charge, found, among other casualties, that
a six-foot arrow had gone half its length through
the boat’s rudder, a kauri plank l|in. thick.
Many of the mountain tribes on the eastern side of
the Astrolabe Range use small bows, which are
handled much more accurately than the huge Wes-
tern affairs.
* * * *
“Gagi” : “E.G.H.’s” sentimental and sym-
pathetic abo. cannibal is all right—in bits. I’ve
known an abo. weep stormily and moistly over a
dead dingo; and one I had felling timber for me
mourned the fall of a big stick for a day and a
half on full pay. Yet these same abos. cheerfully
tortured turtles intended for tucker. They slit the
membrane between shell and skin, and inserted hot
water and red-hot stones until the victim was half
cooked, in which condition he lived for weeks. This
allowed of nice fresh turtle steaks being removed
at pleasure. Similar sympathetic qualities are
displayed by the nomad tribes of the North—most
of ’em are nomads now. Being too tender-hearted
to slaughter tribal ancients when they have become
too old to travel or be useful, they bind them to
trees in upright possies, commend their spirits to
the gods—and go. Ants, crows and dingoes usually
prevent death by starvation.
“Barcoo”: The lubra at White Cliffs
(N.S.W.) who could play the piano had her match
some years ago in Toowoomba (Q„). While stay-
ing at the Royal Hotel in 1902, after a strenuous
thousand-mile droving-trip, I heard a voice singing
“Annie Rooney” to the accompaniment of the piano.
Investigating, I found a full-blooded gin in the
chair singing to her own playing, and doing it none
too badly either. Asking the proprietress to intro-
duce me, I was presented to Miss Polly Perkins.
More or less adopted by Francis Hodgson from
one of the Downs tribes, she had been taken to
England with the family. She had lived on the
other side for some years, and had been educated,
learning music and singing. She came back when
the family returned to its station-home on the
Downs (Q.). But the “call of the wild” was in
the blood, and during the first shearing after her
return an abo. ringer captured her affections. On
receipt of his cheque he eloped with the dusky
maiden, and the honeymoon" was spent with the
“old people” in their camp near Dalby.
“Gaba Tepe”: The squirt at Belford
(Q.) shed killed a snake of a beautiful reddish color,
with black spots on the back. Can any Abo.-liar
identify ? The snake was a two-footer and was
dinkum ; the nearest pub is 50 miles off.
“Beau Yang”: The camp-fire had burned
fairly low, and it was near time to turn in, when
Long Dan knocked the
ashes out of his pipe and
threw this on the screen.
“I was kangarooin’ on the
Loiklin one time. There
was some of the biggest
’roos you ever see. Out
one day I starts a real
O.S. The dorgs could do
nothink with him, and
he soon sticks up. I’m
manoovering in his direc-
tion with a tomahawk in
me ’and, and I gets
pritty close afore his nibs
spots me. Soon as he
does he comes my way like
a long-lost friend. Not
fancyin’ meself in a im-
promptoo eatch-as-catch-
car stunt, I beats it to the
nearest tree 50 yards off
and climbs into a fork
about 12ft. from the
ground. When I looks
down lie’s at the foot of
the tree invitin’ me to join
him,. As I’m pertickler
about me company, I de-
clines the invite, and so as
there would be no mis-
understandin’ my feelin’s
in the matter, throws the
tonmiyhawk at ’is ’ead —
and misses. Struth, the
next I knows he picks it
up and is choppin’ the
tree down. I starts send-
in’ out SOS signals, and
he’s goin good, but lucky
for me he gets the tommy
Jiawk jambed and breaks the ’andle. But it was a
anxious time.”
* * * *
“Vincimus”: “Six and Eight” told us
(B. 21/10/’2O) how to make an easily-cleaned
verandah water-bag. Now let me tell him how to
improve it. After he has sewn the rings on the
four corners of his canvas he should get a piece of
square board —end of a kerosene-case sawn square
will do, but much depends upon the size of his
square of canvas. Bore a hole in the centre of the
board just large enough to take the suspending cord.
Pass the cord through the hole and knot it under-
neath. Now lay board on canvas and pass the
cord through each ring on the canvas corners; hang
up and fill with water. “Six and Eight’s” bag will
hang like a wet dishcloth ; see how mine hangs and
how much more water it hold's. I long ago
adopted his idea of keeping a bottle of cold tea
in the water-bag. At one end of my saddle water-
hag is an ordinary porcelain in- and out-let, but at
the other end is a bottle-neck, sewn in. Follow
the bottle-neck down into the depths of the bag, and
you will find that there is the remainder of a com-
plete bottle attached to it.
FAR-REACHTNG RESULTS.
“Are you the same man that I gave one of
my calces to last week?”
“No, mum. — I’ll never he the same man
again.”
“Paul C.”: The other evening during a
heavy storm the lightning did some effective clearing
work by downing two trees within a couple of hun-
dred yards of each other, and then started a business
that I never saw it engage in before. It commenced
trenching operations in the middle of a ploughed
field, making a vast hole in the ground. There was
no visible object to attract the lightning. I have
always understood that once the electric current is
conveyed to earth its j oT) is done, and I’m wondering
what made it work overtime on this special occasion.
(Continued on page 22.)
FRIEND BUNYIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sky was resting upon the trees
When my bunvip slid from his lagoon,
And sang his song with the lisping breeze,
And bayed his tale to the dreamy moon ;
The beetles boated across the water;
I sat before him upon the grass,
And heard him sing of the black king’s daughter
And mourn his fate that such love must pass.
Ilis eyes were bright as the fungus fire
Where a net of green fern hides the skies,
And greenly matted with weeds and mire
Were the monstrous lashes of those eyes;
His skin was black as a rogue’s hereafter,
His mouth was kind as a baby’s smile,
His voice boomed loud, but the hidden laughter
Was in its cadences all the while.
“Oh-aie!” he mourned, “but her hair was long,
Her mouth was red in its velvet frame” ;
“Ah-ee!” he wept, “when she sang a song
The words were scarlet with unseen flame.”
“Ah-oo!” he moaned, “but her love was worthless,
As easily stirred as my water-bed;
She slipped away and she left me mirthless—
Oh-aie! Ah-ee! and Ah-oo!” he said.
He rocked himself on his padded paws
And dreaming, as thoughtful bunyips do,
He shattered a sapling in his jaws.
“Hi, li!” he mourned, “but her eyes were blue.”
From his fiery orbs came tears a-trickle
Which furrowed paths in his muddy skin;
And while he wept for the princess fickle
The night was soft with the scent of sin.
Thus did he talk to the freckled boy
Who came to sit with him in the dusk ;
Strange was his voice with a wistful joy,
Sweet was his breath with the scent of musk ;
Fantastic stories we told together,
The vast grey bunyip and the lad,
Drowsing there in the summer weather
When the moon rode high and the world was mad.
As I knew that grown-ups always doubt
The things that dwell in the night’s deep gloom,
And might forbid me to venture out
To answer a silly bittern’s boom,
I hid my adventure from their knowledge
And in the nights when the moon was young
Learnt finer things than they teach at college
In the magic lays by my weird friend sung!
VICTORIA.

Can’t Beat Cocoanut
Oil for Hair Wash.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most soaps
and ready-mixed shampoos contain excessive
quantities of alkali. This dries the scalp,
makes the hair brittle and is very injurious.
Just ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponified but quite greaseless liquid) is
far better than the most costly soap you could
possibly use for a shampoo, for this cannot
possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful makes a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and cleanses
both hair and scalp thoroughly. The lather
rinses out easily, and takes with it every trace
of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive o'iliness.
The hair dries quickly and evenly, and comes
out fine and silky, bright, glossy and fluff-y,
appearing to be heavier than it is. And best
of all, this colinated cocoanut oil leaves the
hair as easy to dress again, as though you
hadn’t washed it at all. You can get colinated
cocoanut oil at most any chemist, but be sure
it’s “colinated,” which is not expensive—a few
ounces lasting a long, long time.
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated oil, as recommended above.

Easy Way to Get
Rid of Indigestion.
Although you may have indigestion so
severely that anything but the simplest of
foods cause you the keenest suffering, there
is a simple way to get back safely to pleas-
anter, more nourishing foods. Just take a
teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia in a little
hot or cold water with eacn meal, and begin
at once to eat a little of any food you crave,
fealix Magnesia, which comes in the form of
powder or tablets (never as a liquid or coarse
granules) is not a laxative, but neutralises
the excess acid in the stomach, and so prevents
01 stops all the pain of indigestion. Its use
cannot, like pepsin, soda-water, etc., do the
stomach any injury, and it will soon enable
you to eat good, hearty, satisfying meals of
the foods you like best without fear of bad
lesults. Your chemist should be able to sup-
ply you with Salix Magnesia.
“Hay”: “L. and Tommy’s” gum-tree (B.
28/10/’2O) that refused to fall when it was sawed
through didn’t surprise me a bit. I know how
hard it is to make these old S. Aus. trees lie down.
I had the same experience as “L. and T.’s” friends.
After sawing clean through the butt of a forest
giant I tried, as they did, to lift the vegetable
off it's pedestal with a heavy charge of dynamite.
The explosion raised it 319 ft. in the air. There
it gracefully looped the loop and gently settled
down again on its stump in exactly the same position
as it was before. Riding through Mt. Brown forest
a few years later I was glad to rest in its shade.
It was growing as vigorously as if nothing had ever
happened to it.
* * * *
“H. J. J.”: Is there anything in the way
of tucker that a ’possum won’t tackle? One of
the cheeky little night-prowlers recently started off
on a lump of hot damper, then left the dough to
sample some marmalade, and topped off with the
cold fat in the frying-pan. Evidently a bit ashamed
of himself at this stage, or else determined that I
shouldn’t know him when he called again, he altered
his complexion by taking a header into the flour-
bag. The only thing I’ve known to resist attacks
from ’possums was a pumpkin tart my mate made.
That atrocity lay untouched in front of the tent
at a distance that exactly represented my top effort
at disc-throwing.
“Te Whare”: Nature lias been a niggard
to the bustard (libellously called “wild turkey’’),
the lyre-bird and our two night-jars—white-throated
and spotted. They rarely lay more than one egg;
indeed, though I have seen the bustard promenading
with two chicks in attendance, the lyre-bird and
night-jar I have never found with more than one egg
or chick. Were these matters settled in chapter 1 of
Genesis? The consequence, so far as the bustard is
concerned, is that the bird is becoming comparatively
rare, because Nature can't keep pace with the depre-
dations of foxes, which prey on both eggs
and chicks. The other and more retiring fowls don’t
suffer so severely. They breed chiefly in remote and
barren ranges, and their chicks, unlike those of game
birds such as the bustard, don’t carry a strong scent.
Ravens and crows, however, and other egg-eaters,
including the monitor-lizard and snakes, sometimes
scoop up the night-jar’s showy treasure —cream-
colored, with bold markings of black, and laid on
the bare ground. On the other hand, much less
valuable birds, such as the red-browed and other
finches, produce a large provision for posterity. The
European and certain other night-jars (or “night-
hawks”) usually produce two eggs. By the way, the
name “hawk” applied to these useful insectivorous
and most inoffensive birds is another libel.
“H.A^.E.”: Most birds have their own
peculiar methods of courtship, and some of the methods
are most elaborate. The obscene cormorant lowers his
head, expands his throat, and hops around his lady-
love. The cranes dance, bow and posture with
outstretched wings. This mummery is employed
by the brolga, which is our only true crane. The
drake bows and nods affably to his intended mate.
Most parrots begin with a playful nip, and then
spread their tails fan-fashion and otherwise display
their grandeur to the chosen chook. Cockatoos
and herons raise their crests, and birds of the latter
breed (such as the nankeen night-heron), which
have ornamental plumes, bring these into play. The
laughing-jack and most other kingfishers raise the
tail and droop the wings, while Jack aforesaid
also chortles sotto voce to his little bit of fluff.
Pigeons, of course, are very demonstrative canoodlers,
while the showy dollar-bird swoops up . into the air
and volplanes down to the lady of his choice.
A GRAND CHANCE.
THE PARSON : “Dear me, I could never get
through my work on a forty-four-hour
week! "
THE PARISHIONER (with many sad memories
of many weary Sabbath mornings):
“You could put in for overtime for your
sermons.”
“Paul C.”: “Hoof and Horn” (B.
4/11/’2O) asks for “a good and lasting dressing to
apply round the eyes of stud cattle to relieve ’em
of the bally fly pest.” The following decoction
will relieve stud cattle (or any other cattle) from
THE SCHOLAR.
“And were you taught languages at the mission?”
“My oath, boss. One time I spik every plurry language in the alphabet!”
the bally (or any other) fly pest. Pick a pint of
walnut leaves, and steep them in three quarts of
water for 10 or 12 hours. Then boil the lot for a
quarter of an hour. When cold apply it about the
quadrupeds’ eyes and, in the case of horses, about the
ears, neck and flanks. If “Hoof and Horn” has no
walnut-trees handy, let him gather a few handfuls
of smartweed, which is more common, chop it up
and soak it in a gallon of water for a night.. Next
morning apply the liquor on the places from which he
wants to keep the flies. (Look out that none of this
lot gets into the eyes.) Every fly in the vicinity will
fracture his wiri&s trying to get away from it. A
bloke told me that an infusion of quassia chips was
most effective, but I never tried that and won’t
recommend it, for there was a bloke once who told
my mother a lie.
* * * *
“A.8.C.”: I was bitten by a snake last
year and suffered acute pain ; a man whom I know
told me that when he was bitten the pain was
intense; and a doctor who has had considerable
experience told me that his patients almost always
complained of violent pain. Still, apparently the
bite isn’t always like that. A woman out our way
was bitten on the leg. She sent her little girl for
her neighbors, and a council was held over the
two punctures. One woman came armed with an
old book with “ all about snakebite” in it. There
in a diagram was a picture of the two punctures,
with a circle drawn around them to show how much
flesh should be cut put, as the custom was when the
book was published. The women agreed that it
couldn’t be a case of snakebite, as, though there
were the two punctures, there was no sign of the
circle around them ! But the patient getting sleepy
and, dull, though she said she felt no pain, they
decided to send for a doctor. He treated the woman
and she recovered. Then they all had time to study
the letterpress as well as the picture.
“Johnny Cake”: In reading stories o£
brumbies and brumby-running, I have been struck
by the fact that the authors almost invariably make
it appear that a brumby stallion travels in front
of his mares when hunted or peacefully moving about
the country. This is not my experience, and it is
pretty considerable. I have generally noticed that
the stallion travels behind the mares, and with his
ears laid well back rounds them up much as a
sheep-dog rounds up a mob of jumbucks. On one
occasion when we had run a small mob out of a
mulga scrub on to a little plain, the stallion, an
ill-shapen, yellow brute, suddenly turned and came
full tilt for me with his mouth open. The explana-
tion no doubt was that I was riding a gelding, while
my mates were on mares.
“McNorth”: The period of hot, calm
weather that betokens the end of the south-east
trades and the beginning of the north-west monsoon
is a carnival time for the fishermen of certain vil-
lages along the shores of the Gulf of Papua. At
this time the salawera, fish not unlike mullet, which
go up certain rivers to spawn in the half-fresh water,
come down to the sea in thousands. The fishermen
usually work in the night, floating about the inside
of the river-mouths in canoes, with women and
others holding aloft flaring torches of resinous bark.
The fish are attracted to the light, and men in the
water have no difficulty in throwing them up into
the canoes with their hands, while others do their
darnedest with spears and nets. I have seen a canoe
loaded to sinking point in half an hour. The season
lasts about a week, during which time all hands live
on fish and nothing else. The natives make half-
hearted attempts at smoke-curing the salawera, hut
thousands are allowed to rot. There was a shrewd
old copra-trader at one place who made a practice
of buying up and salting surplus fish, paying at the
rate of one stick of tobacco (value about one penny)
for one fish. Later on, when the season was finished,
the natives willingly bought them back at sixpence.
“Kyogle”: A survey party between Cobar
and Wilcannia (N.S.W.) has during the past few
weeks found six or seven dead ’roos. In no case
had the animal been dead more than a few hours;
they were all in good condition and apparently
free from disease, nor were there signs of any
wounds. Two suggestions have been made here: (1)
snakebite, (2) poisonous herbs. Anybody offer a
better ?
“J.G.”: Any returned soldier or other
land settler want a cheap stump- and tree-puller, or
a machine for hauling heavy logs, etc.? Get a strong
piece of sapling or other round timber about sft. long,
and about 6in. diameter. A couple of inches from
each end cut a groove all round about an inch
deep. Do this with a handsaw and chisel. Now
mortise a hole 4in. by 3in. through the stick about
a foot from the top; then mortise another similar
hole three or four inches lower down. Drive a strong
iron peg—an old bolt . will do —into the centre of
the stick, leaving about two inches of the peg stick-
ing out. Cut two strong saplings—any length, but
say 20 feet. Trim an end of each one to fit into
the mortises, and the puller is complete. Get two
long, strong chains. Make a loop at the ends large
enough for the piece of sapling to turn in when the
loops are put over the grooves at each end. Now
fasten the other end of the chains to a strong tree or
stump. Stand the sft. piece of sapling up on end (it
is as well to drive a long spike in the bottom end
so that it will stand up without holding). The rope
by which you intend to pull the tree to be operated
on should now have one end fastened to the spike
in the middle of the sapling or windlass, and the
other end fastened as high up the tree to be pulled
down as possible. Put the two levers in the m o rt;
holes. Let two blokes push the levers round *
the sapling windlass will revolve in the chain W?
The rope fastened to the tree will wind round rh
vertical windlass, and the tree will come down if th"
rope does not break. One man can work the con
traption, but two men can work it better. I i lu "
performed painless extractions on thousands of box
stumps and green saplings up to a foot in diameter
with these forceps. To get a very tough or bi»
tree it may be necessary to cut the surface root”
To make a strong rope or cable get (say) six W
pieces of fencing-wire all the same length; straighten
them out, and fasten each wire to the spokes of an
old dray or cart wheel (fasten each wire to a separate
spoke). Jack the wheel up off the ground, and turn
it round. The wires will twist around each other
Keep turning the wheel until the wires have been
sufficiently twisted to make a cable. It is possible
with the windlass described to break a cable made of
six pieces of No. 8 fencing-wire. Which shows the
tremendous power that can be exercised by the
machine.

“Stronach”: While recognising the im-
portance of preserving our native fauna, I think the
line should be drawn somewhere. On a Crown lease
I hold—about 500 acres; pretty decent country, too—
I m running four or five hundred boos, not to men-
tion wallabies and wombats. I wrote to the Lands
Department for permission to slaughter, and got it—
for 20 ’roos. I haven’t bothered. When not feeling
worried about £ s. d. it is sometimes my pleasure
to ride amongst my bounding stock and admire their
condition. I find a mob under nearly every shady tree,
and they take quite a lot of stirring, too. 1 haven’t
made up my mind what to do with my block, unless
I turn into a ’roo myself—they seem to lead quite a
decent life.

“Dormant”: Travelling over the plains
between Lismore and Cressy (Vic.), where the Gibson
Bros, have a monopoly of the Federal and State
seats, I saw a whirlwind of a stooker in a paddock
where two binders were at work in a heavy crop
of oaten hay. lie picked up sheaves as a porcupine
might, pick up apples, and it was with some extra
exertion that I caught up to him and asked for the
customary pipe of weed. His reply was to the effect
that the time was not opportune—he must get on
with the job. Another man with ' rabbit-proof
whiskers arrived and asked the freak stooker to
direct him to a J.P., as he wanted a document signed
about some fox skins. “Put it on top of that
post,’’ said the sheaf-shifter, and drawing a fountain-
pen from his dungarees he scratched something, say-
ing to Whiskers, “Don’t take an3 r notice of my not
dotting the i’s; I want to get on with the stooking.”
Twelve acres was the day’s work.

“Blakkat” (Fiji); Know , a larger gorge

two Kai Vitis re their powers of accommodating
tucker. Number one accounted for a case of salmon
a round dozen tins. The other reckoned the money

biscuits. It was all done in one sitting and no
smoko.

Thomas, of Port Macquarie (N.S.W.), came across a
foui-foot black snake which had absorbed about 18in.
of a green-coated tree-dweller. After he had been
handed his life’s measure of waddy the cannibal was
brought to town, where the weird combination defied
the efforts of local scratch-pullers to effect a separa-
tion.

Goodyear Mileage—and
Tyres for Light Cars
A WELL-BUILT tyre yields much more
mileage for each shilling of cost than
a tyre purposely made to be offered at a
sensationally low price. You should be influenced
first by the tyre—second by the price.
Built to deliver exceptional mileage at exceedingly
low cost, Goodyear 30 x 3i Tyres save money,
inconvenience and disappointment.
They represent the same combination of experience, expertness
and care which characterises all Goodyear Tyres of whatever size.
If you own a FORD, CHEVROLET, MAXWELL, DORT or OVERLAND 4,
your choice should be clear. For longer mileage; greater safety; fuller economy;
deeper comfort; instal Goodyear Tyres!
sT
It would be a mistake to think that the New Goodyear
Single Cure Tyre is merely a cheap tyre. If cheapness
were the object, it would be possible to produce a tyre
at half the price.
The fact is that the New Goodyear Single Cure Tyre
is the result of tyre construction developed to its highest
point of efficiency. It IS the lowest-priced Quality Tyre
on the market.

honest criticism is to get them out before
they seed. The old scriptural idea that the
wheat and tares must grow together until
the harvest may be all right in the moral
field; but in the rhyme beds and rhythm
borders the scheme is bad.
The business of merely getting verse into
something like shape is apt to be one of
great difficulty to the person who first feels
that he would like to shape a musical
thought. He looks for models and compares
methods; and the writer of repute who
seems to take the easiest road is the one
first followed. If the repute of that writer
is based on false estimates, it follows that
there will soon be a large crop of cheap and
easy verse-making. A multitude of triers,
looking for the wrong qualities in verse and
ignoring the pure and true for the meretri-
cious and false, may create something like
a school of sham, and actually hold back or
dwarf sincere effort for a generation. Some-
thing of the kind has actually been happen-
ing in America, and in a lesser degree in
Britain; and the root of the matter is bad
criticism. Of course, it must be admitted
that there is no actual line of demarcation
between the literary weed and flower;
neither is there in the case of the things
that grow in the garden, but the gardener
is never in much doubt about what to pull
up. The trouble about the garden of song
is that so much of the weeding is left to
hairdressers’ clerks and civil engineens—
people who know some other jobs very well,
but cannot tell a devil’s apple from a zonale
pelargonium. Books of verse are reviewed
by something like 300 newspapers in
Australasia alone; and in probably 280
of them some sort of opinions are expressed
by writers who have only the haziest nojion
of what they are talking about. Certainly,
very few of the reviews carry any weight
with the reading public, but they do carry
a little with the author ; and where the weeds
are widely praised the flowers must suffer.
Leaving out the great mass of tire smaller
journals—one or two of which review verse
excellently, while the rest publish perfectly
ridiculous statements about it —the big met-
ropolitan newspapers are very grave sin-
ners. To fill space seems to be their one
idea —to describe, to quote, to carefully
hedge the obligation of giving a downright
opinion. Even when a downright opinion
is expressed it is generally a purely arbitrary
one without reasons given. To give reasons
for an opinion on verse is about as difficult
a thing as may be attempted ; and difficult
things fill no more space than easy things.
To quote a _ piece of verse and say it is
good or bad is. generally fair enough, because
there at least is the sample to challenge
the reviewer’s opinion; bu.t to condemn
without reasons given is only justifiable in
the course of an article which has already
given reasons or examples as a measure of
the value of the reviewer’s judgment.
Clearly, there is not always space to explain
every view held; but, equally clearly, the
reviewer should have gained the confidence
of his reader by previous explanation of
other views before condemning or praising
anything on his own bare authority.
If critics would regard it as their busi-
ness to be constructive rather than destruc-
tive their value as weed-pullers would be
greatly increased. A writer may lay about
him on all sides with seemingly great destruc-
tive force, and the fact that he is perfectly
ignorant of his subject may never be dis-
covered ; but let him once attempt to show
where the writer is wrong or might have done
better, and he must fail lamentably unless he
knows what he is talking about. An examina-
tion of most of the reviews of verse in the
newspapers shows that those conducting the
business have reduced the dodging of real
issues to a rather fine art. Here are a few
of the tricks which the incapable or mentally
lazy reviewer puts up:—
(а) Descriptive matter about the author, his
whiskers, his taste in neckties, his occupation, or
his religious views.
(б) Lists of previous works from his pen.
(c) Vague comparisons of his general output with
the writings of other poets, dead or alive.
(d) Talk about “echoes” from other writers.
(e) Futile remarks about minor poetry (nobody
knows what minor poetry is, so it is useful and
safe for filling space).
(/) Lavish use of adjectives in introducing quota-
tions.
(<7> Sloppy attempts at humor where the love of
man and woman forms the theme.
(/<) Very long quotations without comment.
A comparison of 30 or 40 reviews of one book
proved that only three reviewers in dealing
with it showed an intimate understanding of
its contents sufficient to enable them to say a
single word of incisive criticism. The rest
merely worked the recipe a-d-f-h or the
formula b-c-d-e; while the lamest and least
responsible used a-g-c and avoided the trouble
of even turning more than two or three of the
pages.
And so the weeds of verse flourish until the
weeds of criticism are rooted up.
P. J. Q.
The United States War Novel
It is fairly numerous, rather tedious, but
popular in its own country where it is pos-
sibly a sort of salve to the national vanity.
Also it is in a category by itself. A French,
British, Belgian or Serb tale would natu-
rally waste no time in apologetic preface.
The war came like a large, unexpected luna-
tic turning a corner at full speed, and the
story is in it up to the neck and covered
with blood immediately. But the IT.S. was
a looker on from July 28, 1014, to April 5,
1917. Its novelists don’t like to represent
it as out of the swim all that time, a waiter
on dollars and events, a large something
that couldn't make up its mind, the fatted
sport of circumstances, a country of less
account for its size than any other, one which
dared not at all when Italy and even Portu-
gal dared greatly. Its declaration of war
against Austria, the original criminal, didn’t
appear till December, 1917, which put the
Union in the laggard class with Guatemala,
Haiti and Honduras, and this damaged
Uncle Sam’s name for altruism. It sug-
gested that but for the silty ship-sinking tac-
tics of Germany, which spoiled trade, he
might have suppressed his desire to help
civilisation and not come in at all. There-
fore the U.S. novelist writes of a deep, stern
under-current of events, of great and mys-
terious conspiracies and happenings which
showed the U.S., though not openly at war,
as a potent directing influence; he depicts
a generous nation straining at the leash,
and bitter subterranean strife between the
powers of Wilhelm’s darkness and the angels
of Wilson’s light. Typical fictionists begin
like this (Natalie Sumner Lincoln is the
model) :
It was a sultry, brooding day in Washington. The
time was September, 1914. The atmospheric condi-
tions accentuated the tense sensation of waiting, and
the heated leaden clouds suggested the rolling of
events. The city was strangely crowded with sol-
diers, diplomatists and peanut vendors....
Maud ran lightly up the steps of the brown-stone
mansion of her stepfather once removed, and insert-
ing the latch-key pushed the premises open. The
house seemed strangely stuffy and quiet. The hack-
man put her grip in the vestibule. ...
Maud turned and sped to the hack stairs, but
cal] as she would no servant responded, and the
blind-closed window made the passage-way dark,
mysterious and hostile. Unaccountably the servants
were all absent....
Maud had a bath
Maud put on her dressing-gown....
Maud awoke some hours later to find the house
still deserted. She went into the library to tele-
phone. It was then 10 minutes past three.
At 22 minutes past three the library bell rang.
Wondering greatly who could ring a bell in an
empty house Maud entered. She had advanced half-
way across the room when she realised that a man
was sitting in a chair. She asked him who he was.
He didn’t answer, because he had been dead 12 hours.
He had a German accent, though he had died in
English, and a marked German expression. Also he
wore an iron cross. Compromising papers in German
stuck out of all his pockets. His breath smelt
strongly of prussic acid.
Maud realised that not only the dearest interests
of America but the cause of civilisation might be
involved. She took down the sword her grandfather
had carried at Saratoga and was about to sing “The
Star-Spangled Banner”
And here, if I have my way, Maud’s sensible
English friend Elizabeth came in. She
realised the situation. She saw looming a
novel in 48 chapters, pervaded by Hun emis-
saries disguised in sauer-kraut all doing no-
thing with tremendous buzz and energy. She
foresaw that there would be many laborious
characters in it, including Bud Washington,
the chief of police, and Buck Jefferson, the
brainless young detective genius, and Hank
Hamilton, the rubber-soled secret-service
man who had the Stealthy Style and em-
bezzled softly into rooms and prigged silently
out again, leaving no more trace than a
zephyr’s child. Seeing that it was all pre-
mature she dropped the deceased out ol a
back window into the ash-barrel, where,
through the defects of the sanitary service,
he remained undiscovered for nearly three
years—that is, until the U.S. really went
to war, which was time enough. ihen, as
Maud showed signs of patriotic hysteria, she
revived her with afterno.on tea, accompanied
by waffles, Indian corn and baked beans, and
the episode blew over.
J. E.
A Satchel of Books
In the Mountains (Macmillan). An anony-
mous book about a home in the Swiss moun-
tains where three English widows are thrown
together. Not much happens, but theie is
humor and excellent character drawing
occasionally ungrammatical.
No Defence, by Gilbert Parker (Hodder
and Stoughton). A well-told tale of the
days of the French Revolution, shifting from
Ireland to Jamaica, and maintaining . its
interest in every page. Of course Sheila is
bound to have her young Mr. Calhoun, but
there’s a heap of trouble in the way, and
Parker hasn’t to dislocate the long arm ot
coincidence to get her over.
The Bairnsfather Case, by Bruce Bairns-
father and W. A. Mutch (Putnam’s Sons).
In alternate chapters of this book Bairns-
father is humorous about himself and liis his-
tory, and Mutch brags loudly about the
artist’s achievements. Though there is a
good deal that can raise a smile, the general
effect is a desperate attempt at advertise-
ment. The reader feels that if Bairnsfather
needs this sort of thing his claims as tin
artist must be pretty hopeless.
Swift Lightning, by James Oliver Cur-
wood (Hodder and Stoughton). This is
a really fine animal novel with plenty
of animal psychology and no attempt
to give human attributes to the wild
and tame creatures who fill the stage.
The hero is a wolf with fine dog-bloocL£o
years back. The dog in his nature cries for
man ; the wolf of pack experience hates man.
Hurt almost to death, the big grey beast
finds his ill-defined longings satisfied at last
in a home of the wilderness where there is
a woman and a little child. A very happy
book.
Satanism and the World Order, by Gilbert
Murray (George Allen and Unwin). A
thoughtful little booklet by one of Australia’s
foremost scholars. Satanism was a develop-
ment of early Protestantism. Persecuted
wretches in the Bohemian mountains and
elsewhere got the view that the world order
was bad. They saw the Emperor, the Pope
and Christ all against them; and so they
took the persecuted and outcast Satan as
their leader. Their word of salutation was
“The Injured One gives you greeting.” On
this text Murray preaches a fine little modern
sermon. He shows that in all ages the
world order, as represented by Babylon or
Rome or England, has been hated. He hits
hard and speaks plainly. It is a pity his
words cannot get a wider hearing than they
are likely to have.

The ’possum had a rough time in South
Aus. during the three winter months, when
his otherwise complete protection was sud-
denly withdrawn, on a batch of complaints
tha. he was getting altogether too numerous.
About 120,000 skins found their way to
Adelaide markets. They were mostly ring-
tails, of little value, so the average was only
£1 10s. a dozen ; but blueskins went as high
as £5 16s.
“Bill li.” : A custom of the N. S. Wales
squattocracy that screams for abolition is

Certainly the wage of the ordinary stockman
or boundary-rider might look pitifully small

whom the dole comes four times a year
might be allowed the opportunity of getting
out of the tradesman’s books now and then.
Under present conditions he gets no dis-
count for prompt monthly settlements, he is
often hit up for interest on overdue accounts,
and in districts where co-operation benefits
the rural worker he cannot become a share-
holder, because co-operative businesses are
run on a basis of fortnightly payments.

ing to Senator Crawford, who is head-serang
of the Canegrowers’ Association, the cane-
growers—in some districts, anyway—had
given up paying so much a pound for beetles
before they ever heard of the expert. They
reckoned that there were more effective ways
of dealing with the beetles than hand-picking
’em. Apart from that it was considered
that many of the beetles collected had already
laid their eggs and done all the mischief
that they were going to do.

“Newsprint”: The Institute of Science and
Industry has been experimenting, in its em-
bryo forest-products laboratory at Perth, in
the making of paper from Australian woods.
As there has been next to no money for the
work it hasn’t been able to do a great deal,
but some of the Westralian newspapers have
put up enough money for a paper machine,
and N. S. Wales blackbutt and spotted-gum
and Vic. mountain-ash are being tried, while
kauri and jarrah have already been put
through some tests. Now the newspaper
cos. in the other States are being asked, if
they care to put up enough to see whether
newsprint and other paper, can be profitably
made from Australian hardwoods on a com-
mercial scale. Experts reckon that the thing
is feasible at present prices or anywhere near
them, however it may have been when news-
print could be sold in Australia at £ll a ton.
The Forest Commissioners of botli N. S.
Wales and Vic. say that they can find sites
for mills with the two essentials —a good
water supply and enough timber to work
upon.
“D.F.”: Some years ago W. Lowe, who
manages a sawmill at Loyeta (Tas.), asked
the Speck’s Ministry for a small grant to
help him test the possibilities of making
paper out of the sawdust now wasted and
burnt by the ton round every sawmill in
the Speck. He didn’t get it, but the Gov-
ernment spent £lOOO-cdd in importing an
authority from the U.S.A., who reported
that you could not make paper out of Tas-
manian timber. Fortunately Lowe was a
better patriot than his Government, stuck
to his experiments, and has turned out very
decent paper from sawdust.
***-*■
“Barcoo”: Necessity is the maternal
parent of invention, and Brunette Downs
(N.T.), where large improvements are tak-
ing place, is her lying-in hospital at present.
Various motors are employed in the under-
takings, from the run-about to the big trac-
tor, and petrol is £4 per case in those
regions. So W. Hart, an expert in suction-
gas, has been placed in control of the motor
department, and he is putting his pet power
to this new use. The charcoal-gas applied to
the engine of a Ford truck, with a weighed
ton load on board, did 36 miles in 2| hours
on a road which was just as Nature left it,
and only a bucketful of charcoal was used in
the process.
* * * *
“Stripper”: Opportunity is the mother of
profiteering, and the daddy doesn’t always
belong to the master-class. When I was
navvying on the N. S. Wales North Coast
Railway job, a few years before the Big-
Blow-up, several of the gangers ran camp
boarding-houses. If a banjo-player batched
or complained he was “superseded”—and men
were plentiful and jobs scarce just then.
High prices and poor tucker were the rule,
so the stunt worked well for the profiteers,
who were only poor, down-trodden, un-
educated wage-earners. Moral: Don’t give
even the local lad a chance, or he’ll take it
10 times out of 10J.
THE AUCTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Who’ll bid ? Who’ll bid ? ’ the question rang
Where throned Death was calling.
I seemed to sense his charnel tang,
Mephitic air appalling ;
And every tick I heard the clang
Of his steel hammer falling.
Come great men who upon our earth
Had held a lofty mission,
The spacious ones of lordly birth,
The cunning politician,
And gentlemen of holy worth
Or wondrous erudition.
One buyer in a corner trolls
Beyond the ghastly revel.
He buys by lots or single souls,
His voice is low and level.
And paltry is the price he doles.
The buyer is the Devil!

From the Argus :
Wanted, correspondence with woman fond of reli-
gious discussion, view above. , South St. Kilda
Post Office.
Some people look for trouble.
“Yarra Ben”: Of course they must have
footgear and are looking out for “bargains”
like the rest of us, but I must confess I was
rather startled to see this placard in a
Swanston-street boot-shop window: Fallen
Women's White Shoes 14s. 9d.”
“E.T.”: It is hardly surprising that Ber-
nard Shaw is to be the first British drama-
tist to be staged in Germany since the war.
Ilis “Pygmalion” will be seen this month at
Cologne, with Mrs. Pat Campbell in her
original part of ’Liza Doolittle. The show
is under the auspices of the British Rhine
Army Dramatic Co., and it is understood
that G.B.S. will personally keep the watch
during the season.
“Dux”: Mention of a condensed cocktail
(B. 4/11/’2O) reminds me of the “whisky
tablets” marketed in the dry King Country
(M.L.) some years ago. They were com-
posed of capsicum, ginger, kola-nut and
strychnine, and when dissolved in methy-
lated spirits and handed round at a con-
vivial gathering they provided one of the
deadliest arguments against Prohibition that
ever came my way.
“Dido”: I paid my first visit to the
Federal Gallery the other evening, and pres-
ently Billy Hughes got going on the neces-
sity of retaining (1) W. M. Hughes and
(2) a considerable portion of the powers
vested in him by the War Precautions Act,
and he kept at it as if determined to secure
his point by smothering his opponents with
language. Presently the elder lady on my
left asked her companion: “Who is this little
man?” “That is Mr. Hughes,” was the reply.
“Ob '” f'd the first dame. “Awful gossip,
isn’t he?”
“A.J.8.”: I disremember “Hegee’s” Sam
Mitcliell (B. 25/11/’2O), although there was
an old mining captain on the Murchison of
that name, but I vividly recall Alexander
Mitchell, who was town clerk, etc., at Cue
(W.A.). Apparently “Hegee” has mixed
his Mitchells up. Alick, however, was never
a mining inspector, nor did he then own a
pub, although he does now. And, among
many other things, he was about the best
athlete on the goldfield. He was secretary
of the race club, but I’m sorry that the
story about his writing himself an invitation
and an acceptance is apocryphal.
“Hello” (Broken Hill) : He rang the
exchange and asked for “the man in the
post office” —at least I thought he did. “Is
dat da man in da post office?” he asked.
“Yes, postmaster speaking.” “I notta vanta
you. I vanta da man in da post office.” We
connected him with the head of every de-
partment in town, but with the same unsat-
isfactory result. A few minutes later a
very excited Dago arrived at the exchange.
“Votta da matter vit you?” he yelled. “Are
you alia da mad? I aska da man in da post
office, and you putta me on dis vun an’ dat
vun. I vanta da speak about mah-ee feesh.
I vanta da man in da post office.” “Oh,”
said the official in a burst of enlightenment,
“you want the Menindie post office?” “Yes;
yes!” he shrieked. “Da Man-in-da post
office. You give-a me da pain.”
“Adelaide”: Luckily for the public, lawyers
haven’t the doctor’s exaggerated sense of
“loyalty” to the profession. Numerous
recent convictions in Adelaide for selling
“poisons” were appealed against, and the
task of upholding them fell to the Grown
Law Department. Instead, however, of
upholding them it sent its representative to
court to remark cheerfully that it did not
consider the judgment could possibly be sus-
tained, and so it would not argue the mat-
ter. A doctor, whatever the result of his
treatment can always find half-a-dozen others
to say that what he did seemed the only
possible thing to do in the circumstances.
But a lawyer spends half his time in urging
that his learned friend’s law is all wrong,
and so he loses any little sensitiveness that
he might have had to begin with.
Australian sugar-growing will have a cen-
tenary in 1923. As early as 1819 a West
Indian planter turned missionary named
John Gyles put up to Governor Macquarie
a scheme for a sugar plantation at Port
Macquarie, but it did not come off just then.
In 1823 Thomas Scott had the thing going
and turned out, it is alleged, 70 tons of
sugar. Queensland’s first sugar didn’t
arrive till 1859, when 61b. were made out
of some cane grown in the Brisbane Botani-
cal Gardens. The cane was crushed between
two rollers and the juice boiled in a jam-
pan. Captain Louis Hope had 20 acres
of cane at Ormiston in 1863, but even in
1880 the Queensland output was only 15,681
tons. Incidentally, it reached its top in
1917 with 300,000 tons, and if it had stayed
there Australia would not have had to pay
anything up to £9O-a ton for inferior “black”
sugar.
“Werrimee” : It is only since Syd Kidman
acquired several big properties in the north-
west of N. S. Wales and stocked with cattle
that wild dogs have become a serious menace
there. The dingo does little harm among
cattle; in fact, where rabbits are bad he
is not regarded as an unmixed curse. Any
direct action against him is therefore purely
for the scalp bonus, and the cattle-runs are
practically sanctuaries for the pest. The
surrounding sheep-runs thus suffer heavily
without being able to deal effectually with
the scourge. The change from sheep to
cattle has had a bad effect on “the corner”
in other ways. Comparatively few men are
employed with cattle, and there is no har-
vest-time for bands of men as there is with
wool. That cripples trade, and lessens popu-
lation where an increase is very badly
needed. Numerous boundary-riders disap-
pear with the leagues of fences they used
to look after, and small paddocks merge
again into wide, neglected areas. In that
sort of country, where the land monopolist
is a national menace, “one man one run”
should be the law —the run being limited to
10 square miles; and, as most of the country
is leasehold, he should be compelled to
employ a stated number of hands to every
10-mile block. That would compel some
activity on the premises, make reason-
able use of the land’s resources, and safe-
guard the holding from being a plague-spot
and a danger to the rest of the country.

British Built! That’s the reason why
LISTER ENGINES LEAD AND LAST I
ALL the resources of foreign motor-car factories have
never been able to equal the wonderful Rolls
Royce Engine, with its power, flexibility and
extraordinary stability. What is the reason? It is because
of the “tip-top” material and “anti-hurry” that is asso-
ciated with the production of every part.
The Lister Engine is produced along the same lines, and
in the farm-engine world is accepted as the leader for
these same reasons. The Lister Engine is made up to
a standard and not down to a price. You get good
steel where steel means service. No sneaking in cast-
iron to reduce the price a little. And to cap the lot,
you obtain those wonderful Lister Features which are
appreciated all over the world. Dust-proof Gears mean
pounds a year to any Australian farmer. The Auto-
matic Once-a-Month Oiling System eliminates friction,
overheating and frequent stops for cleaning up.
High-tension Magneto, Throttling Governor and 20 less
wearing parts than other farm engines; these are other
reasons why the Lister leads, why it is going strong after
years of service when other engines are a back number.
The Lister is the finest farm-engine in the world because
it is “care free.” Why not write to nearest of the follow-
ing agents for all particulars?

The first book to be copyrighted in Jeru-
salem is a new novel, “The Voice of Jeru-
salem,’’ by Israel Zangwill, which will be
published there and in London simultane-
ously. Meanwhile it is running serially in
Doar llayom, which is Jerusalem’s S. M.
Herald.
“Vanikoro” (Rabaul) : People here have
been mildly amused at the flourish of trumpets
about the great anthropological, botanical,
geological, hydrographic and various-otherie
results expected from the Campbell-Brown
expedition. There is a notion locally that it
is after something that will improve Joe
Cook’s gold basis. Before the war the Ger-
mans drew a lot of gold from somewhere or
other, and it is believed that the Common-
wealth has got a line on it and has rushed
the expedition up to hunt round.
The Speck Government undertook to sup-
ply the Electrolytic Zinc works at Risdon
with 15,0G0h.p. (half of the total contracted
for) by November next year, but such good
progress is being made with the Ouse diver-
sion and other Great Lake works that, if
there is not more than the usual rat.on of
strikes, it will be a couple of months ahead
of time. The co. reckons that it can eat
up the power as soon as it is switched on.
Meantime it is hoped to more or less deter-
mine the best means of treating the complex
zinciferous ores from the Ilead-Rosebery
group.
“Good people can afford to be wickeder
than bad people because the Lord forgives
them more.” That is the simple creed of
the very primitive Methodists of Wales and
Cornwall, and it is the creed of many sects,
political as well as religious. The present
Sydney Government goes strongly on these
lines. It teaches that some men shouldn’t
be expected to do so much work as others be-
cause they are “Labor,” and that a political
party can be more narrow and sordid and
squalid than the average because its high
democratic principles cover a multitude of sins.
By the same simple rule hard drinking is
permissible in a teetotaller but not in other
people.
“Bonin”: Australian seamen were kicking
lately, with good reason, about Jap-manned
vessels cutting into the coastal trade. Now
the Jap seamen find themselves under-
cut and squeezed out of their own vessels
by a cheaper competitor, the Chinaman.
Five representatives of the Japan Seamen’s
Union lately waited on Wakamiya, director
of mercantile marine, and told him that, as
the result of the employment of Chinese sea-
men by several Jap shipping cos., from 7000
to 8000 Jap sailors were now on the beach.
Jap seamen’s wages are not extravagant,
judged by Australian standards, averaging
normally about 25 yen, or £2 10s., a month;
nevertheless the brown shipowners can save
20 yen a head a month by hiring Chanamen.
The Jap seamen are putting in some good
White Australia arguments about the folly
of letting their country’s mercantile marine
be over-run by these aliens; and on the
industrial side the shipowners have been
warned that their policy is “calculated to
cause dangerous thoughts amongst the sea-
men.”
English literature owes a lot to the pub-
lishers of books; and the good tradition con-
tinues in Australia. Of course, the publisher
is a business man and out to make money ;
but, to his eternal credit, he does allow senti-
ment to over-ride his prudence sometimes. A
real enthusiasm over books and their authors
has been almost characteristic of the founders
of great publishing houses. Now the will of
William Heinemann marks the beginning of
still bigger things. Subject to a life interest
for his mother and two sisters, a very large
part of his fortune goes to the Royal Society
of Literature to establish a “Heinemann
Foundation for Literature.” Out of this
fund prizes are to be given for writings of
real value. Fiction is not necessarily ex-
cluded, but the testator’s primary intention
is to help the least profitable and most im-
portant kinds of effort —poetry, criticism,
biography and history. Australia has a
chance to share in the benefaction; for any-
thing submitted to the Royal Society of
Literature will be considered. The judgment
of that body is final.
“Eddyson” : Condon seized an opportunity
in passing to drop in and see Trail in the
lunatic asylum at Ararat, where he had
been an inmate for years. Condon had
known Trail well on the Piper, and was
curious to see how the old fellow was get-
ting on. He looked little the worse for
wear, but did not recognise his old friend.
“He is a hopeless imbecile,” the warder
explained, “but quite harmless, and able to
do odd jobs. He helps the cooks a lot, but
has to be watched, because of his trick of
trying to hide everything up the chimney.
He will take off his clothes even, and poke
them away in the soot, if we don’t keep an
eye on him.” Condon went away thinking
hard; then he took train to Swanwater, and
tramped out to the old field. Here he spent
a day or two wandering round, taking his
bearings; then he apparently made up his
mind that this was a good district to settle
in, seeing that he presently offered to buy
Kyley’s humpy and the half-acre it stood on.
Eventually‘he got the property for £47, and
entered into possession within a week.
There was a little bit of a hillock, contain-
ing perhaps two loads of earth, in Kyley’s
back yard. Condon set to work to carefully
puddle ,and wash it. In the first tub he got
nothing. In the second tub there was not
a color. In the third tub he got 88oz.
of nice, coarse, water-worn gold. That
hillock represented what had been Dick
Trail’s sod chimney in the days of the
Piper field, and Condon had solved the mys-
tery of what had become of the gold Trail
had taken from his surface patch on the flat
in ’7B, not long before his peculiarities led
to his incarceration at Ararat.

We are proud to be able to advertise that
during the whole of the five years of war we
never raised the price of any of our diamond
stock, notwithstanding that diamonds rose 100
per cent, in those years. Our directors strongly
opposed profiteering. They thought it better to
increase customers rather than profits. Their
thought was right, too, as is shown by our
having sold last month DOUBLE what we sold
the same month last year.
We can safely advertise that we are selling
the best grade of diamonds at far less than
English prices.

“Chu Chin Chow,” the most hauntingly
beautiful show ever staged at Melbourne
Tivoli or any theatre thereabouts, is a matter
to be noticed in sections and discussed week
by week, like a gorgeous Christmas panto-
mime. Not that “Chu” doesn’t make a more
poetic appeal to one’s soul than, say, “The
Forty Thieves,” which story from the
Arabian Nights provided the notion for the
plot of this extravaganza. But why speak
of plot? The fact that Casin Baba, the his-
toric Christmas brother of Ali, spells his name
with a K is of small importance in a unique
production where particular human interest
carries no weight. The attraction is in stage
pictures, large and small, the lighting, scant
and costly dressing, color schemes, and music
supplied by an orchestra 30 strong. By its
general effect upon the senses this very
notable production must stand or fall. If the
first impression it makes on the average
woman or man is not a desire to see it again,
Mclntosh’s bold venture will not be a paying
proposition But if Melbourne yields at once
to the sensuous charm of. “Chu Chin Chow”
and wants to see it more than once, then will
the average citizen see it more than twice or
thrice, and British and American experiences
of Oscar Asche’s money-spinner will be re-
peated. To complain that prices have been
raised is not to argue that the rise was not
hilly justified by comparison. Moreover,
the matinee charges are lower, and the
spectacle will run to three matinees a week.
The management is going to do the big thing
in a large way.
* * * *
Of some 15 scenes the principal are Ivasin
Baba’s Palace, where the giddiest of ballet
girls seductively do gambol; the Bobbers’
Cave, where Kasin aforesaid meets his death
at the hands of Hassan; the Slave Market,
where Hassan takes down the dealers and
the human goods are so fine that no large-
hearted male person would know which to
pick ; the Blue Palace, and the Oasis in the
Desert, a place so restful and romantic that
Omar can be reasonably excused for assuring
Zahratin song that Death cannot conquer Love.
But everything else in the series of pic-
tures painted by the Barkers is almost
equally effective. Asche’s production of
“Kismet” is recalled to mind, and compari-
sons are flattering to “Ch u Chin Chow” so
far as the appeal to the eye goes. A glamor

of illusion pervades the air of picturesque
realism in an uncommon entertainment, and
one leaves the theatre like one wakenmg
from a dream. Whether the cast—which
includes welcome strangers in Louie, Pounds
and Frank Cochrane, the producer,., as a
tuneful cobbler—might do more justice to
the characters is not a question that imme-
diately arises. It is hard to say offhand
how much or how little individual per-
formers count in the sum total. Vera Pearce,
Styan, Eily Malyon, Workman, Maggie
Moore, Kay Souper and others are capable
mummers; Gregory Stroud and Winifred
O’Connor (not to be confounded with her
namesake of “Chocolate Soldier” days) have
singing voices of some pretensions, and
everything in the performance will improve
with practice. Meanwhile “Cliu Chin Chow”
is the talk of the town, and nobody knows
quite how to describe it.
Marie Tempest is leaving Sydney as “The
Outcast.” It is rather a pity, for she could
have done much better for herself. In fact,
Saturday night’s audience left the Palace
with the feeling that Miriam was far too
good for the silly, vacillating Geoffrey
Sherwood fGraham Browne), who didn’t
know a good thing when he saw it. The
Outcast is a young woman of character,
humor and sensibility, who cures Geoffrey
of the drug habit he fell into when his girl
jilted him. In return for the cure, Geoff-
rey provides Miriam with sufficient cash to
run a very limited estanlisliment, where he
is cock of the walk. Then when the jilter
calls him back, Geoffrey runs away from
Miriam to his first love, who then begins
once more to act like a balky horse, this
time because she’s afraid of disgrace. And
Miriam, who has proved herself a regular
Digger, allows the idiotic playwright to ship
her off to Buenos
Aires with the still
first-love hungry
Geoffrey, when in
reality she’d have
told him to go to
the Devil by him-
self.

Melbourne Symphony Orchestra had a
concert at the Town Hall on Saturday and
made a present of the takings to its hard-
working conductor, Alberto Zelman. Bar-
ring a Mendelssohn concerto, wherein he
fiddled to the unassuming baton of John
Dawson, Alberto led his band through the
rest of the programme, comprising titbits
of Haydn. Wagner and Tschaikowsky.
Haydn’s “Clock Symphony” and Wagner’s
"Dance _ of the Apprentices,” from “The
Mastersingers,” gave the conductor some
vigorous exercise, and the whirling Tschai-
kowsky’s “Nutcracker Suite” enabled him to
simulate a fat man in a Turkish bath. Each
item was finely played, but the orchestra
showed in the brisk “Nutcracker” that it
was following a. road it had often
travelled before. Mrs. Alberto Zelman had
a voice in the entertainment. She sang a
set of Verdian a'rs, including her old friend
“Ah, Fors e Lui.”
*
“The Yeomen of the Guard” was elabo-
rately produced at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, on
Saturday night; and no grand opera com-
pany has been served by a finer orchestra
than the combination which performed under
Slapoffski. As Jack Point Charles Walenn
cut out tomfoolery and stuck to the book
with excellent effect. lie is a genuine
comedian, and he possesses the even rarer
gift of being able to articulate properly—
very different from Sergeant Meryll, an n.c.0..
whose rotten word of command would cost
him his stripes in any active-service unit.
James Hay plays Colonel Fairfax. He
makes a very personable young warrior, and
the beautiful numbers, at once whimsical
and sad, are well suited to his sympathetic
voice. It is a long time, by the way, since
so many really good voices came together
in a Sydney show. Patti Russell, Strella
Wilson (Elsie) and Thelma Carter (Phoebe)
being all out of the ordinary in this respect,
while Charles Mettam, who is rather wasted
as Leonard Meryll, has one of those tenors
that young women cheerfully travel miles
to hear. All the broader comedy is well
done, more especially Alfred Kavanagh’s
Head Gaoler. The “Yeomen,” among the
very choicest of all the Gilbert and Sulli-
van works, is to run for only a fortnight,
after which the venue will shift from Lon-
don to Venice. On Boxing Day “The Gon-
doliers” goes on.
“High Jinks” was revived at Sydney Cri-
terion on Saturday night, with Dorothy
Brunton in the star part and Alfred Frith
(w'ho ordinarily plays Colonel Slaughter)
away ill. Dorothy sings sweetly and acts
and dances like the little artist she is, but
her effort lacks pep. or ging. or something.
She may be slightly weary of this particular
musical-comedy veteran; but certainly her
audience wasn’t. Every old gag was re-
ceived with rapture, the poorest songs were
encored twice or more, and when Madge
Elliott danced with Jack Hooker the house
went quite mad. This Sydney girl is
threatened with a bright future, apart from
dancing. Her weakness is a tendency to
over-act. Field Fisher, William Greene,
Cyril liitchard and George Willoughbv are
all admirable, and E. Noble, who had to
take over the chief comic role at short
notice, makes a complete success of it.
“High Jinks” is merely holding the fort till
Christmas time, when “Baby Bunting,” the
show in which Dorothy Brunton smote Lon-
don between the eyebrows, is to be staged.
Conductor Joe Bradley had the N. S.
A\ ales State Orchestra to back up his Phil-
harmonics’ production of “The Messiah” at
Sydney Town Hall, and in spite of floods of
rain it drew the Saturday-night music-glut-
tons. A steadily-improving Gladys Cole, for
some months past a pupil of Bradley’s, flung
out banners of sound as the soprano Soloist,
and was greeted with, the loud hand; but
M ill Dallison got away with the honors of
the evening. L. H. MacCallum and Gertrude
Brookes halved the bass and the contralto
parts between them. “The Messiah” will be
sung again on Christmas night.
. * i|: »I«
“The Blue Pearl” makes the trouble at
Sydney Lyceum. Stolen from one of the
courts of Europe, it has been bought by a
faithless husband with his wife’s money and
handed on to the other Cat. She wears it
to a party givt'n by the wife, and after that
you have to take a taxi to keep up with
events. The same address harbors a set of
black brothers that we know little about—
cannibals seven feet high with their back
and front ribs crossbarred; the turtles
large enough to cope with the Seven-
footers’ vast appetite; sharks that make
t use of the Sydney beaches appear
l.ke a mere vegetarian cafe. Crystal Palace
and Strand show Jack Pickford as “The
Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come,” with
Pauline Starke as Melissa, the sweet little
New England gill who tights for his happiness
at the expense of her own. Same screens
have Viola Dana panting for a Rolls Royee
and trying to raise the cash by means of a
bunch of love-letters written to her by a
foolish young millionaire. Wallace., Reid

Back again at Melbourne Royal, “The
Boy” is keeping its end up in a musical way,
while the cast continues to repay admira-
tion except in a couple of important parti-
ciliars. Kitty Barlow, whose art now lan-
gnishes in the role of Millicent Meebles,
seems too tepid a successor to Ethel Morri-
son, whose ruffled dignity was always humor-
ously expressed.
A pathetic sight at Hoyt’s, Melbourne,
this week, is Theda Bara trying to discard
her vamp characteristics as the Irish heroine
of “Kathleen Mavourneen.” If is a pretty
little story on Boucicaultian lines, but
Theda robs Kathleen of her nationality
every time she smiles. “The Girl in No.
29,” which follows, provides a dizzy career
for Frank Mayo. Spotting a damsel on
the verge of suicide, he leaps madly to the
rescue and thereafter works overtime in a
dilly movie intrigue before reaching the
safe anchorage of a happy ending. The
Majestic is telling the tale of the beauteous
youth and maiden who, primarily parted
by his giddiness and her marriage with a
profiteer, are thrown together by an aero-
plane smash on a desert island. The film
is after a foolish story by Gouverneur Mor-
ris called “Trumpet Island,” and the leading
lady wears the name of Marguerite de la
Motte. Anther female with a terrible
name. Za Su Pitts, fails to adorn the other
Majestic tale. “The Heart of Twenty.” It
is a weak, schoolgirly effusion built on the
American proverb that every shroud has a
golden lining. The Britannia supporters

Fritfc Hart took his Conservatorium stu-
dents through "Figaro” at Melbourne Play-
house oh two nights last week. He produced
a crop of nice young voices, but amateurish
awkwardness marred the work of some of
the owners. The gleaming naughtiness of
Susanna, for instance, was reduced by Lilian
Stott to an aspect of maidenly stiffness
more appropriate to a charade at a bishop’s
birthday party. Likewise the wicked page,
Oherubino, lacked the necessary devil be-
cause Lilian Starr was short of the com-
modity. Miss Starr warbled the favorite,
"Voi che sapete,” with fair success, but it
took her some time to reveal that she had a
voice. The next evening’s Cherubino was
brightly handled by Iris Turner. A IloWett-
Worster, who produced the show, schemed
as Figaro with all the craft of Beau-
marchais’s original hero, Clifford Lathlean
was puffed Up With the jealousy of Count
Almaviva, and in his love for Susantta fre-
quently poured out enough passion for both.
The Countess was under the care of Adele
Crane, who, like May Foulds, the other
Countess presented, never deviated from the
frozen dignity considered proper to the role.
For over two solid hours without a break
and in the glare of myriad electric lights and
past mayors’ pictures, Melbourne Uni. Con-
servutorium students made music the other
Wednesday night at the Town Hall. Prof.
Laver must have been pleased with his
youthful tribe, who had quite the profes-
sional touch in all but their deportment.
Mrs. Jaiison Swelled with her pride in Nellie
Lafferty, a Campefdown girl with short
locks, a scholarship of music, and distinct
dramatic ability. Pier Aria wasn’t allowed
the encore it won. The orchestra, part pro.
and part Student, Was even, and included
several of the star students on the pro-
gramme. The instrumentalists, especially
Gwen Prockter (’cello) and Violet Wool-
cock (yiolin), showed greater promise than
most of the vocalists —the conspicuous excep-
tion besides Miss Lafferty was Miss Neville-
Johns. The one pianoforte solo was by the
only male performer in the singles—Cecil
Bois, a pupil of Edward Goll. Strength and
restraint marked his playing, but a pause
while he screwed up his seat for the Second
part of Liszt’s Rhapsody (No. 12) grated
upon the nerves of the soulful. There Was
a large, mostly-female audience: among the
few men only one slept, and did it nearly
in time to the music.
Allan Wilkie at Adelaide Royal keeps his
team going hard, his plan being a Season of
three weeks with a fresh play every night—
which is probably a record for a Capital, city
in recent years. He is giving Adelaide the
novelty of “The Merry Wives” and the
“Comedy of .Errors.” The support is good all
round, barring one or two curiously weak
spots. Business continues large. The Weather
has been more suitable for evening fires than
out-door shows, but the So-and-So crowd at
tb-e Garden Theatre still draw. The dancing
is fine and so is the singing; but the humor sO
far is mainly knock-about. University under-
graduates crammed the Prince of Wales’ for
one night with a variety show, largely consist-
ing of irreverent topical allusions. West’s
pictures are strongly emotional; as a relief
Larry Semon has an agitated ape, a fine actor
and mischief-maker. At Wondergraph “Why
Change Your Wife?” is a kind of sermon on
the easy divorce facilities of America, with
unusually fine gowns (mostly on Gloria
Swanson) thrown in. Wondergraph is now
pi ay ins' iiwthe open-air as well. But nothing
goes than an Australian play, a
version of the old “Robbery Under Arms,”
at the Pav.

“Whitebait” : Bailey and Grant and their
pals, the Taits, have had some trouble in
casting their panto this year. Seemingly
Eleanor Crane was imported to take the
job of principal boy, but Jennie Hartley,
who has a contract for leading parts witli
the Tait-Williamson combine, had to be
found something in exchange for her great
salary, so Eleanor was disappointed and
given the top line in the programme
This settled, war was declared in another
quarter. An expensive English, comedian,
who, according to the publicity boosters, had
hurried from abroad to startle Australia as
a Dame impersonator, apparently grew cold
about changing his sex and expressed a pro-
found affection for a. masculine rsle which
had been allotted to Jack Cannot. As Can-
not clung to his part and the other fellow
couldn’t be persuaded to change his mind, an
extended sitting of the directors, associate-
directors and deputy-directors evolved the
bright idea of bringing over Phil Smith.
Smith wouldn’t be the worst Dame in the
world, but the proj'ect was soon abandoned
through an outbreak of peace between the
Firm and Dan Agar. Daniel had lately been
talking of bringing J.C.W. Ltd. to court over
an alleged breach of contract, but something
must have happened in the meantime, for he
is _ now boomed as Mrs. Sinbad and every-
thing at the King's is lovely once more.
Dial Sight”: Australia had no more
enthusiastic Shakspearean than Henry Gyles
Turner. He was steeped in knowledge of
the Swan of Avon and his analytical essays

on the plots and characters of the plays
were relished by the Melbourne Shakspeare
Society for years. For years also he held
readings at his own home at St. Ivilda, where
a few enthusiasts, book in hand, would take
part. The manner in which the veteran
banker could infuse drollness or pathos even
into these readings suggested that if finance
had not claimed him the stage might have
had many a worse Bardolph or King Lear.
“ Nor bell”: Jefferson Tait, who has had
a long, steady job as Fuller’s Newtown
(Sydney) villain, is handing in the forged
will, monocle, revolver, mocking laugh,
chloroform bottle and other tools of infamy,
and going back to his comparatively virtu-
ous trade of pill-punching. A brother-in-
law of Jeff’s is Tal Ordel, a bright mummer
who hails from Gippsland, and occasionally
breaks into brisk verse. Their wives are
sisters of theatrical manager Philip Lytton.
“E.T.”: Mention of “Mrs. Potiphar” Ethel
Warwick reminds me that the Mr. Potiphar
of “Joseph and his Brethren,” Frank Harvey,
has packed his props and departed for fresh
boards and footlights new. Harvey accom-
panies Marie Tempest on her trip to Soutji
America to play the parts he was associated
with on her previous visit here. A sound
mummer, who has given several noteworthy
performances in Australia, Harvey will be
missed.
“Smike”: As “Old Pot” says (B.
9/12/’2O), Gaston Mervale is a “fine
musician.’’ He was fingering a piano very
early, and would probably have followed his
brother (who clung to the family name of
Mistowski and became a professor at the
London College of Music) if the footlights
hadn’t caught Gaston’s eye. The Mistow-
skis are of Polish origin, and they are all
pretty smart with the rapier and the gloves.
When he first came to Australia with “The
Sign of the Cross,” he clouted a large and
offensive colleague one night, and the thud
of the falling Hercules shook the theatre
to its roots.'
“Snell” : In the upstair bar at the Royal
one night, during a Rignold season at that
theatre, Oily Deering, the comedian, was
bantering a tall slip of a young actor. “Ah,
well,” said the latter with great self-satis-
faction, “so far the profession has brought
me bread and butter.” “And eggs, Arthur—
and eggs !” said Deering. Then Deering told
a yarn about a
small Albert Park
boarding-house a t

of repulsion he replied: “Ah, son, you tod

had had as many eggs thrown at you as I
have had in my time.”
“41”: The remarkable difference between
the first-night performances of the -Sydney
Repertory Co.’s “Two Mr. Wetherbys” and
“Getting Married” struck The Bulletin ;
and of course there’s an explanation. On the
day of that first performance of the Wether-
bys Gregan McMahon was a very sick man,
and had to be doped to appear at all. As
it was he had a temperature of 103°. The
play is not really a bad one; but it is rather
against a play when actors (or actresses in
this case) leave out great chunks of it. This
is what two of them did ; and of course the
parts they left out were parts that mattered
very considerably. The second performance
of the play was an altogether different
thing. “Getting Married” was, as The B.
critic said, a great triumph for McMahon,
who started with the rawest of raw material ;
but his inexhaustible patience assured success.
Anyone joining the new Repertory Society
may feel assured that the plays will be worth
seeing and the acting tolerably good. More
members are wanted badly. The society’s
office is at 51 Castlereagh-street.
From .a New Yoik theatrical sheet’s
account of an evening at The Friars, a
pros’, club, presided over by Bert Levy, the
ex-Australian black-and-white artist: —
Mr. Levy also introduced Mr. Hugh Ward, the
Australian manager, who is en route to Belgium
to be invested by King Albert. Mr. Levy asked
Mr. Ward to step upon the stage and dance as
he did 20 years ago. Mr. Ward accepted the invi-
tation, and the house went frantic as he soft-shoed
and clogged.

trouble than anything else Gilbert gave him.
llie difficulty was to preserve the theme
without becoming monotonous. It is the
only G. and S. opera in which Rutland Bar-
lington did not appear, although Shadbolt
was written for him. Courtice Rounds and
\\ allace Brownlow, both well known in Aus-
tralia, were in the original production; and
no one is as glad as the viola when the cur-
tain drops.
* Ilamfat”: Apropos of animals on the
stage (B. 9/12/’2O), Rupert Julian, a very
01 dinar y actor who, like other ordinary
actors, has become a film-star in America"
once had a painful experience with a dog’.
The faithfulness of a hound was one of the
features of the play in which he was tour-
lng; but, instead of taking a dog round with
it, the company used to score some local
advertisement by announcing that “Mr.
Blanksby’s champion spotted dingo Barken-
bito will appear in the role of the dog
Caesar”; and sometimes Caesar was a mastiff
and at times a Skye terrier. As long as the
animal growled at villainy and wagged its
tail at the hero (Julian) it didn’t matter
much: but in Auckland a morose bulldog
was secured, and other things happened. The
faithful beast was to have tracked the hero-
ine to the house whither the villains bad
lined her, and before Julian could bound
to the rescue he had to climb a wall. But
perched on the top of the shaky stage pro-
perty Julian noted ominous signs of canine
hostility. These grew more pronounced
when he tried to soothe the growling brute,
and became positively alarming when, the
‘wait” having become painful, he dropped.
There was a growl of savage triumph, and
the actor-r made for the wings with the dog
clinging fondly to his trousers. He returned
with a rent in his pants to face an hysterical
house, but, like his own calf, the dog-part
was cut.
J. F. Hogan on some London plays and
players:—
Marie Lohr has had no luck with “Every Woman’s
Privilege,” her latest venture at the Globe. It is a
slight thing and was severely handled by some of the
critics, others damning it with faint praise. Marie
ought to have cut her losses and tried her luck with
another of the numerous unacted plays stored up in
her cupboard, but the case being desperate she
essayed a desperate remedy, viz., completely altering
the last act. The lady gained nothing for her pains
out a jeu d’esprit in Punch.
Matheson Lang and Lillah McCarthy are apparently
in for a long tenancy of the New Theatre, where
“The Wandering Jew” is drawing packed houses. It
is not so much a play as a series of spectacles, cul-
minating in a creepy representation of burning the
Jew alive. Lang’s playbills .are printed in Yiddish
as well as English, and his audiences contain a con-
siderable proportion of well-fleshed individuals with
large cubed noses.
Things being a bit too lively in Ireland, the com-
pany which usually inhabits the Abbey Theatre,
Dublin, has transferred itself to the Ambassadors,
London, where it has made a hit with the amusing
“White-Headed Boy.” This comedy achieves a
record in that the ejaculation “God help us!” is
used 55 times. Hitherto “Henry the Fifth” has
been understood to hold the belt in this respect: it
mentions the Deity 38 times.
Shakspeare no longer spells ruin. Crowded houses
are now the regular rule at the “Old Vic” in South
London, where a new Shakspearean season has begun
with a fine revival of “The Merchant of Venice.” Six
years ago, when Miss Lilian Baylis, who runs this
famous playhouse, started giving Shakspeare at
popular prices, the audiences were discouraging in
the extreme. The first night of “Hamlet” yielded
40s.
Madge Titheradge is leading woman in “The
Garden of Allah,” which has caught on so unmistak-
ably at Drury Lane that it is to be continued through
thF Christmas season. Drury Lane without a panto,
on Boxing Night will be something beyond the recol-
lection of the Oldest Cockney, but the directors are
putting on a panto, at Covent Garden instead.
“Old Rot” : There was a precedent, if a bad
one, for the change of the name of “The
Magistrate” (B. 2/12/’2O). “Dr. Bill,” in
which Robert Brough and Myra Kemble
added to their reputations, was converted
into a musical play in England under the
title of “The Kangaroo Girl.” There was
as little need for the change in this case as
in that of “The Magistrate.” It was the
sort of thing that used to be the stock-in-
trade of the pirate; but times and manners
have changed.
“66.48” : Patti Russell’s record takes some
beating. She played Yum Yum at an hour’s
notice and without a rehearsal, Phyllis in
“lolanthe” with one rehearsal, and Mabel
in “Pirates” at 14 hour’s notice. In Sydney
last year she took Amy Castles’s place as
Mimi in “Bohbme” with a new cast and no
rehearsal at half-an-hour’s notice. And
in Melbourne she played Marguerite under
the same conditions. I suppose they have all
been done better; but they have all oftener
been done worse.
“Gundy” : A part that Florrie Young loved
and that suited her down to the ground was
Lodoiska in “The Merveilleuses.” Not only
was Lodoiska one of her finest roles, but in
the writer’s judgment the play was one of the
very best productions of the Royal Comics.
Somehow,. though, it never caught on. It
was billed here as “The Lady Dandies.”
Espinosa, the dancer who a year or two
ago was skipping on Australian boards, is
comfortably “shopped” once more in London.
He is the ballet-master at the Gaiety, and re-

cently got a flood of limelight in connection
with a society formed for the “standardisa-
tion” of operatic dancing. Members of the
new cult will only be permitted to teach steps
approved by the committee, and Espinosa
says the motto must be “Sincerity.” Jazz so.
“Hamfat” : The remark that “all old men
should pass over in the first act” (B.
2/12/’2O) reminds me of Darrington Blue-
chin, one of the finest melodramatic actor-rs
that Gobblegutting ever saw. Darrington
impersonated the old pot who was killed in
the first act, but in the third spasm, the
company being limited, he had to be his own
grandson. “I am his grandson and heir!”
he thundered when the villain interrogated
him about his interest in the deceased. Where-
upon a dear old lady in the audience observed
audibly. “He’s like his grandpa, too, only he
looks older.”
“J.W.”: The essentially Philistine Doug-
las Fairbanks, greatly daring, proposes to
impersonate D'Artagnan. The French,
especially the cabotins (it is only French for
“actors”), are dismayed. There is such a
gap between the romance of American pic-
ture corporations—the “reach-me-down”
method—and the real romance of Dumas.
Yet, oddly enough, D’Arjtagnan was pictured
on the precursor of the film as early as 1897
or 1898. Henry Hamilton’s version of “The
Three Musketeers” (a play which would
draw all Sydney these days if only manage-
ment knew and actorhood could!) was
“filmed”—that is, continuous pictures of it
were taken on the principle of “Ten Little
Nigger Boys” (the nucleus and prototype
of the film), and of those revolving ads.
which lent their artful aid to the names of
the stations displayed in the carriages on
the old sulphurous “underground” in Lon-
don. _ Barrie immortalised them in “The
Admirable Crichton.” You turned a handle
and watched through peep-show eyeholes,
and behold you saw Lewis Waller as the
dashing D’Artagnan! Waller’s birth in
Spain, though of English parentage, had
given him the radium of ftomance. With
whom be the peace!

While I shuddered to hear his vibrato;
“Give the Devil his due”—
With a wink then he drew
From his pocket a raw, ripe tomato.
“He’s good,” said my friend once again ;
“It takes a cute critic to spot him ;
He’s good, I insist,
Too good to be missed.”
Then he flung the tomato and got him!

of social tonnage, to give the match a lift: a popular
sport’’ for choice. Thus in a photo of the N. S.
Wales XI which won the intercolonial match at
Christmas, 1874, Joe Coates, the captain, lias with
lnm George Gilbert, Ted Powell, Fred Spofforth,
George Morgan, E. Tindall, Nat Thompson, Ned
Sheridan, Charley Bannerman, Ned Gregory and J.
Wood, and Edmund Barton as umpire. Thompson,
Sheridan, Bannerman and Gregory ranked as pro-
fessionals. Bannerman is still about Svdney; Fred
Spoffortli leads tlie life of an English country gentle-
man. Without an exception, I think, the rest have
gone west, among the last of them the High Court
Judge who in those days carried the umpire’s bat —
for he wasn’t a bit a friendly umpire who didn’t
have a hit while waiting- for another man to come
to the wicket.
The gods who select Victorian cricket
elevens have been slated for their fondness for
antiquities. The row brought one of the selectors
into print with some aspersions on the Rip Van
Winklish qualities of
one of his accusers. But
that is no answer. The
selection is not com-
manding respect; and
what can you expect
when cricket struggles
with horse-racing for
top place in a selec-
tor’s affections, and
when many Saturdays
are spent in punting
instead of watching
the cricket colts?
There is any amount
of talk of getting new
blood in the State
eleven, but some fresh
fluid among the selec-
tors would be equally
welcome. The idea of
a consistent horse-
follower picking
cricketers would be
grotesque anywhere else
but in Victoria.
“NIP” PELLEW,
South Australia’s
rep. in the first
Australian cricket
Test.
Things have changed in the English cricket
world. In the days of Spofforth and Murdoch, and
many years later, the rule for the five Test matches
in England was—two at the Oval, two at Lord’s,
one at Manchester. Now Manchester, Leeds and
Nottingham are each to have a Test. In one respect,
however, the programme is just as it was 30 years
ago, for the tour will conclude with a match against
C. I. Thornton’s team at Scarborough.
McCarron, manager of the S. Aus. cricket
team which was treated by the N. S. Wales Associa-
tion as if it were buying a sewing-machine on the
time-payment plan and were behind with its instal-
ments, has ceased marvelling at his frigid reception.
He remembers that he arrived in Sydney on a Fri-
day and that his hotel room was No. 13.
“Barney” Oldfield, aged 25, isn’t by any
means the youngest ’keeper that an Australian XI
has known. Jack Blackham was 23 when he made
his first trip abroad in 1878 ; Alf Jarvis kept for
the 1880 XI when only 20, and Carter at 24 went
orf with the XI in 1902. Oldfield doesn’t risk
suicide where Gregory’s deliveries are concerned, but
he stands right up to Mailey. Off the latter’s
“googlies” he stumped two in the trial match, and
put down three and caught one against S. Australia
last week. He has scored 217 runs this season, aver-
aging 43.4.
♦ * * *
In all the test matches between England
and Australia only Kpotforth and Trumole have done
the hat trick. Spofforth bagged Emmett, Mackinnon
and Royle with three successive balls in 1879 ; and
Tremble similarly captured the wickets of Bli nes,
Gunn and Jones in 1902. Two years after he did it
again, the procession to the pavilion comprising
Bosanquet, Lilley and Warner.

Richmond had another day of leather-
hunting in Melbourne District Cricket on Saturday.
P’ran was the opposition and knocked up 3 f0r329, three
inter-Staters, Lampard, Ellis and Willis, contributing
the bulk of the score. Lampard made 111, Ellis
106 and Willis is 51 n.o. RytJer scored 132 out of
’Wood’s 9 for 233 against Melbourne. It was a
sound, chanceless innings marked by special circum-
spection in dealing with Melbourne’s new bowler,
McDonald, who finished with the good average of
5 for 68. McDonald brings a leg-break from Warr-
rambool and promises to lend variety to Melbourne’s
attack. St. Kilda began well with 3” for 200 against
East, but Baring and Scott got busy with the ball,
and there were 8 for 278 when the bell rang. T.
Horan (62) was Saints’ best, whilst the usually
reliable Hotchin went for an eyeglass. ’Roy dis-
missed Northcote for 143 (McDonald 4 for 46, and
Cannon 4 for 43), and so far ’Roy are 2 for 88, with
Cody and Liddicutt not out. Hailes (61) was Essen-
don’s biggest performer in a total of 261, and South
have made an unpromising start with 2 for 4. The
Carlton t. North match was a circus for the bowlers.
Truman (8 for 33) brought about North’s debacle
for 63 ; Carlton’s response is 8 for 81, Schade cap-
turing 4 for 27.
Australia’s two reps, in the Oxford XV
that defeated Cambridge by 17—14 last week were
R. H. Bettington and H. Forsayth. Both are
ex-students of King’s School. Parramatta. Betting-
ton. last season made a stir in the Oxford XI, and
thus gets a cricket and football “blue” in one year.
In school cricket in Adelaide, Prince
Alfreds seem to breed the giants, but St. Peters the
steady average. When Gun last week made 144
for Saints, people with memories recalled that the
best previous for the school was L. V. Pellew’s 127,
made two years ago, and that till then Charlie Hay-
ward’s 126 had held the record since 1883. Mean-
while, for Princes, Clem Hill had made 365, Doll-
ing 311 and Joe Darling 252. Yet St. Peters have
won 23 games to Prince Alfred’s 19. The one just
ended was spoiled by weather. Saints made 334' on
a perfect wicket; Princes 128 on a rain-ruined one.
Following on they put up 286 (Jaehne 85, Walsh 84),
Giffen (a nephew of George) 25 not out. Saints put
in their sloggers to knock off the 81 required, but
disaster set in, and at 8 for 61 things became hysteri-
cal. Nerves took a hand, and there were two run-
outs with both batsmen at one end. Boucaut, the
captain, kept his head, stayed in with 18, not out,
and got home by two wickets; but the honors of
the game were mostly with the losing side.
* * * *
A fair-sized crowd fought through the
great gale to Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, the
attraction being Jerry Sullivan v. Silvino Jainito. The
combatants earned their money easily, as has been
increasingly the case at, headquarters of late.
Jainito won the first couple of rounds. Jeremiah hit
him fairly low as soon as the next session started,
and as this produced no effect either on the iron-
framed Islander, or on Joe Wallis, who was referee-
ing, ho let go one that fairly shrieked for attention.
Amidst a storm of hoots—directed for some lunatic
reason at the inoffensive colored person—Sullitan
was disqualified. The only justification for Jerry’s
performance is the well-known fact that the most
vulnerable part of Jamito is his waistline. Sullivan
may have been aiming at it in all good faith, but
it is as hard to believe that his sense of direction
was at fault in this case as it was to credit the
same thing of the equally skilful Symonds the pre-
vious Saturday night. It is an unfortunate truth
that, under existing conditions, fouling pays. The
stakes accrue just the same. The period of assault
and battery is shortened, with the result that the
fighting lives of both boxers are lengthened. Pro-
moters haven’t been accustomed to take much notice
of “L.F.” in the record books in the past. And,
most remarkable of all, the crowd which is done
out of its admission money by a foul extends its
sympathy in nine cases out of 10 to the pug who
has defrauded them. If those in charge of the game
laid it down that in future any boxer who fouled
should lie off and learn his business for not less than
six months, the response would be immediate. Care-
lessness must be to blame for the new epidemic,
even where the explanation doesn’t wear a darker hue.
The English critics decided last week that
Joe Beckett is “a temperamental boxer,” Frank
Moran, the second-rate Yankee heavy-weight, having-
knocked out England’s „ champion - as easily as Cai”
pentier had done. The actual fighting lasted only
four minutes. - If the charge is established Joe’s
career should be ended. There is no more irritating
spectacle than one of these punch-shocked performers
in action, and the only one in history who has con-
tinued to draw after complete exposure is Wells.
Australia hasn’t had many cleverer glove artists
than Dave Smith, and few filled the Stadium better
until McGoorty hit him on the jaw for the first
time. Jim Sullivan, the English middleweight
champion, was as clever as Dave, but he too lost
his nerve, and the crowd declined to witness his
pusillanimous efforts further. The Prince and his
brother the Duke of York witnessed last week’s
fiasco, and the King is represented as hanging fever-
ishly on the result at the end of a telephone-wire
* * * .
Tennis enthusiasts, who are busily con-
sidering Australia s prospects for the Davis Cup, are
all discussing Patterson’s chances against Tilden,
"'ho beat him at Wimbledon, but barely mention
Johnston, Tilden’s great partner, who is equally for-
midable. As a mat-
ter of fact,' the
U.S. La w n Tennis
Association in ranking
the 100 best players in
America a while back
placed Johnston first
and Tilden second.
Curiously enough, an
English tennis autho-
rity, trying to pick the
world’s first 10, brac-
keted Johnston with
Patterson for first, and
left Tilden fourth to
the brilliant French-
man Gobert and the
Jap Kumagae, who
were placed second and
third. This selection
seems rather unjust to
Tilden, but, anyhow,
it shows the respect in
which the other man
is held. Patterson is
probably more afraid
of Johnston than of
Tilden. The latter is
dazzling and meteoric,
but Johnston’s virtue
is a deadly certainty
in all departments of
the game.

Molly s Robe, the other starter, began to fade at

showed her true form (she dropped her backers the
previous week), while Furst again was runner-up.

The Southport Handicap was a close thing between

The Auckland (M.L.) Clip, to be run
towards the end of the month, has attracted a big
entry. Tenterfield (Sea Prince —Tenterhook), whom
Kemball imported from Australia and who won his
first race last September, is well up with Bst. 31b.
for the two miles, and Dusky Eve, who, with
7st. 3lb. made the Australasian record for lfm., bas
a pound less. The M.L. Cup-winner Oratress, with
9st. 21b., is up 91b. Vagabond (Bst. 121 b.) has
practically the same weight as he had in the other
Cup. The imported horse Prince Willonyx has
only 7st. • 101 b., and another Australian, Trespass,
who- beat Amythas at w.f.a. over 9fur., has more
than Buckley's with Bst. lib.

“A.W."’: The commonest greeting in Syd-
ney these days is “Wota-yer-know ?” On two recent
dates, only a day or two apart, Victoria Park put
through 11 and 14 events respectively, 222 per-
formers facing the barrier on the latter occasion.
Kensington followed within four days with 14
events and a run-off; three days afterwards
came Rosebery with 13 and a run-off. And
Ascot and. Victoria Park within the next week
staged respectively 14 and 13 events. A few
long-priced ones raised the red flag at the last-
mentioned meeting', but of the 52 races contested at
the meetings previously quoted 45 were won by
horses which went out at under 10 to 1. Which
means not merely that Ike was wary, hut that there
was a tremendous volume of betting.’ With two half-
day horse meetings and two all-day pony meetings
around _ Sydnev practically every week, sane pro-
hibitionists will soon start diverting their energies
to anti-racing. And they will find some powerful
arguments, too. The great game is supposed to be
for the betterment of the thoroughbred, but when
ore sees 14.1 ponies like Lady Liddell and Precious
Dust waltzing away from the best, big and small,
the thought arises that the great game does just
as much for the perpetuation of weeds.
* * * if
Old Cetignc lias been well and truly backed
for the A.J.C. Villiers Stakes on Saturday, and if
the weather holds up he may be favorite on the day.
But owing to the record Sydney downpour fast work
has been impossible at Randwick for some time, with
the result that the condition of many of the nags
starting in the big mile will be all to’ blazes at the
business end of the proceedings. The Villiers is a race
in which the despised outsider frequently rolls home,
and, considering the backwardness of some of the
more accomplished milers, history looks like being
repeated. King’s Word was in good racing condition
for Rosehill a fortnight ago and may have a chance,
a remark which also applies to the speedy Wish
Wynne, but whether she will run out a mile is a
problem to which there is no guide. Beauford—if
he is ready—and Kenilis may be the hardest to beat.
Sid Beck, the Sydney club champion, put
up a great swim on Saturday when he gave Owen
Griffith 4sec. and a licking in the 100yds., cutting
out the distance in 57 2-ssec. This is the fastest
swim done by a Sydneyite for two years in club
events. Beck is a versatile performer, having to
his credit, amongst other things, the 220vds. breast-
stroke championship of Australia, and the 100yds.
back-stroke championship of N.S.W.
Violet Walrond, M.L.’s 15-year-old girl
champion, competed in a 100yds. scratch race at
the N.S.W. ladies’ carnival at Coogee last week.
Fanny Durack, Afina Wylie, D. Lewis and Marjorie
MacDonald were also listed, but none of them
started, and two post entries from L. Robertson
and Mattie Mealing were accepted to make a race
of it. Adopting-a remarkably clean double over
arm stroke, with a flutter kick, the Maorilander
established a lead of two yards from Alisa Robertson
at the fir-t turn. The next push-off at 665yds.
saw her four j’ards to the good, and, swimming
beautifully, she came away in the final lap and
won bv about seven yards in lmin. 14sec., or Bsec.
worse than Fanny Duraek’s world’s best.
It says a lot for the seamanship of the men
who handle Sydney’s 18-.f'ooters that so many of
them kept afloat in last Saturday’s handicap. Out
of 21 entrants 18 came up to the scratch. Desde-
mona, splendidly handled by A. C. Roberts, won,
and everybody felt pleased: it was Kismet’s little
sister’s first victory in two seasons. As Florrie
didn’t turn out, Desdemona was virtually the limit
boat off 55min. Off the wind to the flag at Clark
Island she increased her margin to 24min. Hero
(George Degan) capsized at the flag: Kismet was
ordered off for having fouled Swastika; Britannia
turned turtle, and Golding was disqualified for
neglecting to round the mark at Shark Beach, and
Desdemona lobbed home with 2min. 40see. to spare
from Advance, which anticipated Swastika by three-
quarters of a minute. Arline was the only craft to
gain any time on the winner.
For the first time since Aoma won the
bauble in 1914, the race for the King Edward VII.
trophy was sailed last Saturday under the auspices
of Sydney’s R.P.A. Yacht Club. Six faced the hurri-
cane, and the order of their going was: Oenotie (.1.
Af. Brunton) 28min., Magic (Rov Stevens) 14min„
A'erlba (Lord Forster) llmin., Aoma (Stan Stevens)
lOlmin., Sunbeam (A. \V. Crane) lOmin., and Bona
(ben Patrick) scratch. Owing to the big sea run-
ning through the heads, the course set was round
Pile Light, Shark Island and Pinchgut twice. Oenone
was first away, with the fleet under small canvas
following at intervals. Yeulba’s chance looked
good until off Oemorne her peak halyards parted.
Oenone won with four minutes to spare from
Magic, which was fmin. away from Aoma. The
G -G.’s luck as a yacht-owner has so far been exe-
crable, Yeulba having come to grief three times in
four starts, and on each occasion through carrying
away her running gear.
Sydney Motor-cycling Club’s 24-hour re-
liability over 406 miles of N.S.AV. roadway ended in
five riders-—three side-cars and two solo—getting
through without loss of points. All bestrode Indians.
In MaorHand failure to keep boxing en-
gagements is treated quite seriously. Jimmy Clabby
found this recently when the lapse caused his dis-
qualification for six months by the Wanganui Boxing
Association. An appeal to the M.L. Boxing Associa-
tion was unanimously thrown out. A little more of
this won’t do us any harm.

The late Henry Gyles Turner was a
rowing enthusiast. ’Way back in 1867 he pulled
No. 3 when the Bank of Australasia four-oared crew
won the Banks Cup. He was elected president of
the Banks Club the previous year and held the office
till his death. Since September, 188. r >, Turner was
the Vic. Rowing Association president; and his
exhilarating lecturettes were bright spots in many
otherwise dull evenings.
* * * *
“The Pariah”: Really our fellows are
comparatively all Lyonses to-day. In 1883, at
Melbourne, A. Bannerman and W. L. Murdoch took
30 minutes to make 10, and after 152 minutes’ bat-
ting W.L. was 19 n.o. At Manchester in 1886
Scotton was in 67 minutes without scoring, and left
at the end of 225 minutes with 34 to his discredit.
The same loiterer in 1884 at Adelaide batted 364
minutes for 85. In the same year the great AV.G.
took {5 minutes to make 31, and in the same inn-
ings Lucas was 121 minutes gathering 24. In
none of these cases was the position desperate. On
another occasion Murdoch was in for 30 overs before
breaking the ice.
If the Prince rides Kinlark in the Grand
Alilitary next March several records will be estab-
lished. It will be the first occasion on which
the heir-apparent has ridden across country in public
in England, and the first time a Walcr has figured
in the great Service event. The only other European
royalty to take on a venture of the sort in recent
years was the Grown Prince of Germany. He
came third in a big, long-distance military ra'e in
1912, and had won a number of small steeplechases
at the time he was barred from further efforts of the
sort bv the Kaiser. The Sandown course, where the
Grand Military is run, is one of the smallest in the
United Kingdom as regards the size of the obstacles,
but it is tricky, and the soldiers race over it at a
tremendous pace. Kinlark might win in experienced
hands, but with his genius for safely negotiating
big obstacles he would probahlv be better suited else-
where—perhaps even at Aintrec itself.
**- * *
“15-80”: Melbourne tennis writers who
have not seen the American team in action talk
confidently of an Australian victory in Auckland
at the end of the month. They base their hopeful-
ness on the power of Patterson to belt througn any
opposition under any conditions. Patterson has
bulldog courage and great physical strength, and
if he has a hard run in the beginning he will use
all his devil to yvin. Being a rather indolent player
with easy opposition, he has to be driven to fight.
Pat O’Hara Wood should prove a trouble to the
Americans if he gets into the pink. His service pro-
bably sacrifice's a good deal of pace to certainty, but
he is a delightful volleyer, an excellent driver, and
has much of Brookes’s intuitive genius in placing
a ball in the right place at the psychological moment.
As for Brookes, he will *Still be formidabe in the
doubles, presuming that he isn’t winded in the open-
ing sets. Still he hasn’t the steam for a gruelling
five-set go, and having to do all the headwork for
himself and Patterson, he is probably not facing the
coming struggle with his old equanimity. But for
Patterson’s service, he might do better with O’Hara
Wood as an accomplice, and it is a pity he hasn’t
practised .with Wood with a view to saving Patterson
for the singles. The fourth man, Heath, will doubt-
less not be called upon to appear, but if by some
mischance he joins in the fray, our chance of holding
the cup will be immensely reduced.
THE DOMINATING FACTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Nay, not the side that wins the toss
Will win the coming Test;
No tricks of “pulling” balls across
Will prove one side the best.
Take notes in the pavilion,
Observe the luncheon feast —
1 want to put my money on
The side that liquors least.
Oh, cricket is a noble game,
Or so I’m always told;
I've showered praises on its name
Since 1 was six years old.
But this I know, when bowlers fail,
Or batsmen weak appear,
The cricketer who turns the scale
Is mostly good old Beer.
Beer dominates the cricket score
In country or in town ;
Beer now, as in the days of yore,
Puts many a wicket down.
This maxim (meaning no offence)
To captains I’d apply:
Just put your trust in Providence
And keep your teamsmen dry.
VICTORIA.

otherwise Baby, has as much beauty as any.
Her wedding dress was of vellum-tinted
satin and gold brocade, with a clingy veil
of plain ninon wrapped round her like a
sheath. The wind was very tempestuous,
and the chief bridesmaid, a plump relation,
made a regular ballet exit down the church
steps. Three other small plump members of
the clan made up the bridesmaid list. They
were all dressed in tawny glace silk printed
with big roses. Sam McCullagh's small
son, in white satin, had .something to do
with a white satin cushion. The bride had
the most expensive orchids on record for a
bouquet. Mamma always favors black
and white in her dress. Her garment was a
wonder in this combination. Papa looked
arge and worried in the frocky swirl. The
bridegroom, young Bobby Landale, seemed
hJippy, despite the fact that his golden hair
will not stay plastered in the fashion of the
moment. A brother backed him up as best
man.
The party, when it wrenched out of the
crowd, streak for home, which is No. 13
Domain-road. The house was a bower.
Cveiy niche had been utilised to squeeze in
the throngs of guests. Even the garage
™ as caraouda Sed with crimson ramblers,
rnu ±amily cars were not at home, of course.
They were on the highways blowing with
bows of satin ribbon. The mustering of
wool was so thick one could almost smell
the yolk. 1 airbairns, Landales, Armytages,
tliirn.sides —it was a regular gathering of the
clans. But not of all the clans, for one
relation had an opposition party at her home
during the wedding celebrations. It scarcely
mattered, because there was not room for
another crossbred, or even a merino.
There was much champagne and very few
speeches. One uncle bewailed the fact that
be had a speech prepared and was not called
upon. Pretty nieces laughingly bundled the
toilorn one into the garden to watch the
photographers pose the party, and he gave
his speech to the delphiniums and the windy
sky. _ Sister Mrs. Bussell was in black.
Oousm Mrs. W heatley was snugly bolstered
m dark blue. Mrs. George Chirnside was
conspicuously handsome in black. Mrs.
? T ed Armytage was in cool blue-and-white
toulard. Maie Ryan, just home from a
jaunt, looked tricky in a navy suit. Mae-
kinnon, of the Argus, escaped a speech by
demonstrating how his knees were trembling
It was a swirl of jollity.
f The bride got into a little clinging fawn
trock and a mushroom hat. and bolted through
the roseleaves to her car and to some secret
honeymooning place. Roma Clarke ITarri-
so?\ home from her honeymoon, cast a
critical eye over Joan’s wedding presents,
hhe was exquisitely mounted in fawn suede
color, with a gold and turquoise turban on
top, and crocodile-skin shoes at foot. The
presents were a gorgeous array in a room
oft the hall. Some of the cheques would
pay a war indemnity.
Most of the bride’s family sported black
tiapenes. They are not out of mourning
for an aunt, Mrs. Felix Armytage, who was
a h airbairn.
* M , C ?°, n r a lf T , the robust chick of Charlie
McDonald, M.H.R., was married to Lieut.-
Colonel C. IT Brmsmead at the Wyselaskie
Hall of the Presbyterian Ladies’ College last
week. A s Ivy’s dad is still the victim of
n iw e u’ l ur w ? ddin S wa s kept so quiet that
ail the 1 wills” were whispered and the
parson was fitted with a silencer. Ivy’s
husband is the new Director of Civil Av'ia-
tion in Australia, and has an M.C. and an
U.D.h.
Now is the time of year when clusters of
stage kiddies, with or without mothers in
attendance, fuss and fidget in train or tram-
car. They are going to or from the all-dav-
long rehearsal, and with three pantomimes
n the last throes of preparation small girlies
are met in all directions. One knows them
from non-professional” nippers bv their
tawdry showiness and half-a-dozen other
marks of distinction. The curled ringlets
tell of recent release from paper and rapid
return to normal lankness. The shabby
white boots have been at least half-cleaned;
the skirt looks exceptionally short for Cissie’s
age because her legs are remarkably de-
veloped. As early as nine years old she
begins to look rather “forward” and raffish,
and at VI she has acquired the ballet-girl
habit of rolling her eyes at anyone or every-
one save the child ot mother she is talking
to. And how tired she is at times! She
yawns like a bored poodle waiting for its
morning nap. She i§ almost too weary to
wonder whether she is attracting attention,
and much too fatigued to be even conscious
of the fact that the thick ends of her sturdy
understandings are glaringly in evidence.
Much dancing, of course, accounts for the
fine-and-largeness of Cissie’s lower extremi-
ties, and previous acquaintance with the
back of the stage explains her roving eye
and don’t-care manner. She has been there
before. Although a panto fairy be not more
than seven next birthday, the chances are
that She is already a child of experience in
the business. She was probably a tadpole
or an imp at the age of four.
Sassiety is on the move, and will eat its
Christmas plumduff in a bungalow near the
plage or in its mountain fastness. Mrs.
Norman Rrookes did not accompany her
“(iood little Normey” to Maoriland for the
Davis Cup, but goes en famille to their Mace-
don humpy. Sorrento is filling up with its
faithful Leslie Stuarts, Simon Frasers and
Hammond Cleggs ; whilst Macedon is being
stormed by the Bailiieus, John Grices, Mit-
chells, William Smiths and Ross Thomsons.
Lowell Thomas has been feted until even
his very-blue eyes grow tired. The process
of entertainment varies very little. A
hostess collects many women and a few men
to meet him. They are fed on tea and little
cakes and ices and strawberries. Music is
sandwiched in with the talk. One of the
numerous songs-at-the-piano damsels invari-
ably turns on her tricky voice and coy
manner. The songs-at-the-piano girl always
has a small voice. She sings tame domestic
stories to music. The subjects are repeated
with awful monotony. F’rinstance, the sub-
urban maiden pretends to go shopping but
goes aeroplaning instead, and she says
to Charlie-the-aviator after every verse
“Ummmmmmmm—isn’t it nice!” Then there
is the small child who finds daddy kissing
the cook and tells mamma. That is all set
to music. . Next the girl who really did go
shopping vamps the shopman, who says he’ll
take a kiss instead of money. The girl
grabs the new hat and coyly chortles “Grand-
mamma will pay.” Lowell Thomas has had
them all thrown at him from every quarter.
He will never realise the real music and
voices that belong to Australia. Still he
gets more or less even. He retaliates by
telling and retelling his tamest little chest-
nuts if the darlings call for a speech.
The winsome personality looking out from
these bright features so attracted Edward,
P., that he danced three times with the owner
in the hour and a
half that he spent at
the Civic ball ten-
dered him in Hobart.
The Mayoress (Mrs.
Eccles Snowden) has
made a great social

±he chief warbler was Lizzie Newbold, the
charming little Richmond girl who had her
soprano voice trained up b.v Marches!, and

staughton supplemented the urogramme with
tea and cakes.
Mrs._ A. E. Y. Richardson—her busy hus-
band is Superintendent of Agriculture—
gave a party at the Austral Salon which
stirred, that quiet club. The hostess, in white
crepe brocade and a picture hat. helped the
musical programme with songs. Her
soprano used to belong to the South Aus-
tralian concert platform. The Lowell
Thomases were at the party; also the
Mayoress and the ex-Mayoress. Esmelton,
of the O’Hara Theatre, came with sister
Mrs. Quinnell. Benno Scherek played
divinely.
Eugenie Stone Doughty is hitting things
up in England. She has a house in London,
and during the ‘‘season” appeared at a big
ball as “Australia.” The dress was a tunic
weighted down with gold nuggets and edged
with a deep fringe of natural wool. The
lady carried wheat in a sheaf as a bouquet.
She might have worn a pat of butter for
a tiara.
Dr. Monahan Lewis, of Auburn, is to be
dean of the faculty of dentistry at the Uni.
for 1921. Son of a State school-teacher who
ruled at North Carlton for many years,
Lewis, who is the King of Spain’s double,
has done a great deal to raise the status of
dentistry and have the Uni. brand put on
it. He can be quit* interesting on other sub-
jects than teeth.
Violinist Gwyn Davies, here pictured by
Monteath, soared into notice 10 years ago
and annexed an Ormond Exhibition that
took her to the Uni. Conservatorium, where
Charles Manby, Pro-
fessor Petersen and
W. A. I ..aver were
her immediate and
strongest influences.
In Melbourne she met
the Danish virtuoso,
Max Schluter, and
at his invitation
went to Copenhagen
to continue her
fiddling under his
care. Schluter i s
one of the finest
violinists in Europe,
and he has sent
Gwyn Davies back
with a royal tone and
all the technique she
will need for the
rest of her life.
The young Australian appeared at a Walter
Kirby farewell the other day, and will recital

Sir Ilenry Wood is waiting anxiously to

brated Henry just missed her in London,
and only reached her after she had arrived
in Melbourne.
Margo Lester, a niece of Mrs. Fred Army-
tage, ha.s been stage-struck to some purpose.
She has a part in “Humpty Dumpty” panto.
—a part with several lines and a couple of
songs. Margo is a good-looker, with won-
derful red hair and a fetching voice.

Dr. Leon Jona and his wife filled the
lounges and winter garden at the Oriental
with a party last week. Mrs. Jona, in the
palest pink frock, had papa and mamma
Kosminsky to help. There was an excellent
music programme—Mrs. Jona is a musician
of ability herself. Kirby put in a song
or two when he could wrench himself away
from strawberries-in-icecream. General Sell-
heim and his wife were there. So were Dr.
Cuscaden and the Lowell Thomases —they
are going to Papua in May or June next.
The Tom Hogans, just off to Maoriland, blew
in for ha.lf-an-hour. Mrs. Staughton was
in evidence with a big mushroom hat and
a lace veil. The Mayoress and also the
lately-deposed Mayoress were present. An
exceptionally big bunch of men came—Prof
Osborne, Dr. Lenzer. Francis, M.LI.R. (who
also wears the rabbit-skins of Malvern)
Dr. Springthorpe, Dr. Sinclair, Wireless
Balsillie _ and Mr. Adamson. The men had
turns with Lowell Thomas, who was the
lion of the occasion.
Melbourne Herald proprietary has bought

Vera Pearce's majestic figure is well
adapted for her gorgeous trappings in “Chu
Chin Chow.” In the first act she- wears a
floating Court tail of huge leaves of many
colors, with a headpiece to match. In an-
other act her draperies are encircled by a
golden snake. In one inset Miss Pounds
H orkman and another show a color scheme in
fuchsia tints lovely enough to drive Blamire
loung dippy. Vera Pearce, like all the
other women, shows just a waistline of bare
skin winch becomes her very nicely; but the
statuesque lady looks less happy in the act
Which calls for a dishevelled hair effect, her
wealth of wool being ruffled out too heavily.
“Sidney Culver,” principal male dancer
in Her _ Majesty’s panto of “Humpty

doubt Maggie finds it easier to adore Culver
than associate with Yates, after the testi-
monial the latter got in a law court a while
back.

Sister Adelaide’s postscript :■ —
What with college cricket, speccli days and vari-
ous by-products of the University Cbmmeirt., this
has been the young persons’ week. Commein. was
duly (and dully) celebrated at the Klder Hall, with
Chancellor George Murray in the chair, flanked by
his Ex. and other officials. The real business was done
on Thursday, when the students revived their con-
cert and procession after a six years’ hiatus, and
provided two excellent shows. Officialdom sounded
a warning that the latter would onty be allowed
if decorum were guaranteed, and the undergrads
stuck to their bargain. There was nothing that
a Mid-Victorian could cavil at, and in; the local
skits there was more real humor than in any former
show. The concert was on the same level, and the
Weigalls were part of the huge audience that smiled
on a series of jests that swept in his Ex. with the
rest.
Of the week’s concerts the most notable was by
Brewster Jones’s pupils, who were sole composers, as
well as sole performers. Oscar Taeuber’s concert the
next night produced a new songstress, Reka Grasby,
still in her teens or thereabouts, with a sweet,
well-ranged voice.
A signed photograph of Edward, P., has come to
Mrs. Daisy Bates, Who organised the corroboree at
Cook for H.R.H.’s entertainment on his Perth-to-
Adelaide journey. It came with the Prince’s “best
wishes for success in the work to which you have
devoted your life.” The plucky little woman is still
laid up in her tent at Oodlea, but gradually climb-
ing the road to recovery.
For the first time since gran’ma was a girl there
was a Hunt wedding on Thursday, when Eileen Har -
grave said “I will” to the Adelaide Hounds Master,
Ernest Luxmoore. The knot was tied at the St.
Peter’s College chapel and the cake cut at the
Charlie Hargreaves’ house in North Adelaide. Both
parties can lay claim to a fine record of war service
—he with the Light Horse and she in The War
Office. The engagement is just announced of her
youngest brother (also ex-A.1.F.) to Ursula, daughter
of the Howard Lloyds and a great-granddaughter of
the late Henry Ayers.
Matron Graham, R.R.C., has handed in her
resignation as matron of Adelaide Hospital, where
she lias been ever since she came to this village from
England in the early ’nineties. During the war
she put in a good many months in charge of the
Luna Park Hospital, Cairo, where she was respon-
sible for over 1600 beds.
Adelaide’s attractive policewoman has had another
pirate fined 355., but the girls are beginning to
wonder how they are ever to meet nice young men
without introductions if police-ladies make mashing
unpopular.
The new Graduates’ Association started a novel
idea, an open-air lunch in the Botanic Park, just
before the annual commem. The main idea was to
welcome the new graduates, but the Association,
whose mission is to impress on the community at
large the importance of University matters, got a
.useful boost in the newspapers.
Mayor Moulden’s first annual report to the City
Council records the completion of the second section
of the IV ar Memorial Drive. This opens up to
vehicles the north bank of the Torrens Lake. The
first section runs - from the Zoo to the Oval, the
second passes just south of the Oval, and the third
will be less picturesque than the others—
will go alj the way to the weir, completing a drive
of about two-and-a-half miles.
Our new Scotch College has grown out of Kyre
College, and is housed in the old Barr Smith
home at Mitcham. (It claims, by the way, that
the old Barr Smith theatre is “probably the finest
hall attached to a school in Australia.”) Gratton is
the head, lately a master at St. Peter’s; Willsmore,
the inter-State cricketer, is one of the staff; the
secretary is Walter Paton, son of the long-ago minister.
At the first annual meeting, Governor Weigall told
the boys to hang on to their Scottish traditions, and
compared John Knox rather favorably with Moses.

Ihe French Consul’s party had the finest
weather and the gayest plumage of a week
that was otherwise compounded of macin-
toshes, goloshes and split umbrellas. The
French colony and its admirers turned out
in great radiance to honor Captain Giraud
and officers of the slim grey French frigate
in the harbor. The four dark Frenchmen
wore cloth uniforms, but Commodore fiuma-
l'eso brought his brood out in white duck.
Giraud himself is an electric battery, and has
a string of medals extending from one
shoulder-blade to the other. Farmer’s smok- 1 -
room simply vibrated with female charm and
male bravery. Mrs. Campana, in charming
grey frocking, looked after her guests with a
dozen little courtesies that the up-to-the-
moment hostess has lost. The Verbrugghens
talked all the time with every bit of their
bodies; Mrs. Holman swathed herself in blue
brocade with a sort of Zouave top-piece
made with gold-tissue sleevelets; there was
a perfectly entrancing model in nigger-brown
eharmeuse. with the panniers turning back
to show tinges of a pink that was like a
mushroom in the early morning; Mrs. Cum-
berlege wore black satin with great effect and
lace frills; and Mrs. John Hughes brought
a tall daughter-in-law. The Consuls for
everywhere came with their wives, the tall
Teppema lady wearing grey jersey cloth with
rust in bands upon it. Mrs. Gordon Wesclie
was effulgent, and Mrs. Willie Collins wore
a green feather in her bonnet and was striped
to tone. The Playousts were there; arid
simply dozens of tall, dark Frenchmen with
moustaches and sleek heads that suggested
pomade. Two French youngsters, like
cherubs, but dressed in naval togs, were the
hit of the afternoon ; while Eugenie Moreau,
in lavender, wearing a lavender hat with a
twist of green on it, looked as though dressed
for a French soubrette part in a musical
comedy.
The butterfly section of the community
didn’t turn up to the tea party arranged by
the Alfred Meeks lady with an eye to forming
a committee for the Industrial Blind appeal.
The flood weather, no doubt, had a lot to do
with the absence of the tuppenny-colored;
even in stepping from a limousine to Farmer’s
doorway some of the bloom might be washed
ob ! . So the good old penny-plains had the
discussion to themselves, and didn’t make a
bad job of it either. It really was a bad day.
The roofs seen from the balcony were just a
shining wetness—what a glory the sight of
that continuous splash of grey rain would
have been to any of those whose cry comes
out of the deep pits of perpetual darkness!
Mary Gilmore offered a ton-pound cheque
that had just come to her in royalties for her
“Passionate Heart,” and, Mrs.’Aronson being-
present, Mr. Hedger was reminded that only
once before has the institution called for out-
side assistance, and that was in 1593 when
Alfred Stephen sent out an SOS and was
answered by Gertrude Fisher (now Mrs.
Inskip), Mrs. Aronson and Mrs. John Marks,
who arranged a dance in the Paddington
Town Hall.
Sandwiched in between rains and floods
the gallivanting Storeys were At Home to
their Parliamentary and other friends, and
there were rose decorations and strawberries
by the bucketful. The morning’s down-
pours had spoiled the tea on the lawn and
verandahs idea, so the M.P.’s dining-room
was invaded by millinery of the smartest.
The Storeys had given the profiteer his due :
Mrs. John was arrayed in rich blue satin
that carried furlongs of georgette pleatings ;
daughter Bessie was a foam of white georg-
ette. with a droop hat that carried a pink-
and-blue flowerbed; while Mrs. Tasman
Storev was befrilled in grey eharmeuse and
topned off with a rose-pink hat. All the
Ministry’s wife was there in georgette and
crepe de Chine; and Mrs. Ben Fuller came
in a green and grey creation that didn’t
look a bit skimped because of Ben’s aid to
an embarrassed Rhodes scholar.
Baroness Furnivall, the pretty 20-year-
old girl who arrived in Sydney a few days
ago ; is among the few who are peeresses in
their own right. Her father was Lord Petre,
and the whole family has been persistently
Roman Catholic as far back as the written
history of England extends. The Furnivall
barony, which was allotted to Sydney’s new
visitor in 1913, is even older than the Petre
one, having been created in 1295. A con-
nection of hers, by the way, Mrs. Philip
Fitzalan-lloward, has just married Captain
Mills, of the well-known shipping family to
which Mrs. Jimmy Burns belongs. Her first
husband, a Guardsman, died of wounds in
1918. His elder brother, and the present
heir to the Howard of Glossop barony, was
one of the innumerable A.D.CVs that came
and went during the Strickland regime.
Farmer’s smoke-room was a galantine of
grey matter, and you could have had brains
of all descriptions for the asking, when four
long tablesful of Feminists entertained
France, Serbia and Brisbane. Olive Kelso
King, in a duck of a black hat with ospreys
upon it, was Miss Preston Stanlev’s left-
hander, while on the right sat Miss Soubeiran
and Miss Gurney, just back from their
Australian-French miss.on of mercy. Fur-
ther down sat Professor Mayo, from Bris-
bane, who, as is the way of tiie new psycho-
logist, knows more about motherhood than
any woman in the flesh or out of it. Olive
Kelso King’s quick-lunch tale of her experi-
ences was amusing in a quiet, ragging sort of
way. as for instance when she told of her
march with the troops, the only woman
among 60 men, sharing food shortage and all
manner of hardships with them, but allowed
a _ bed to herself. Up-table sat Mrs. Kelso
King, Olive’s stepmother and great chum,
with a gorgeous enamel and diamond breast-
plate that one of the Feminists was still
mere woman enough to envy with unbated
breath. Miss Soubeiran told of the amazing
jobs done by women in France during the
war. One, the wife of a pastor who had
gone to the fighting line, even went on earn-
ing marriage fees for him. It really was an
interesting lunch, the only trouble being that
the male guest of honor, owing to time limit,
wasn’t able to get in his spoke at all. Ruby
Rich brought mother to lap up the brain
waves; Mrs. Ken Street was there, but didn’t
make any disclosures; and Miss Bruce
twinkled over everything. The Feminists
swab their brains with iced-water only ; the
Millions Clubbers, whom they are out to
rival in numbers, wax fat on a syrupy fruit-
cup.
Alan Canny, this year’s dux of Sydney
Grammar, had a clouded hour of triumph
I he prize-winner in science, Latin, English
and a few other things, he got from head-
master Lucas the certificate: “The best all-
round boy the school has seen for many a
long day.” Twenty-four hours before 'the
results were out, his mother, who had just
been taken to a private hospital, was're-
ported seriously ill; and her condition was
then, and still is, causing very grave anxiety.
Alan, who captains the school’s rifle team,
and is almost as much at home in the water
as on land, is an only child. Dad is Sydney
manager of the Bank of Queensland.
Here Fanny Durack has been snapped by
s.ster Mary just prior to a swim in one
of the American pools. Fanny cannot re-
member when it was she learned to swim,
blit her first victory
was over Dorothy
Hill in a race for
girls under 12 at
Cleveland - street
(Sydney) baths a
good many years
ago. Her State
championships, which
she began to win
when she was 12|,
have occurred with
“monotonous reg u-
larity ever since,
while in Australian

beat her in the
100yds. last season, and that was just pre-
vious to an operation for appendicitis. She
has held world’s records for every distance
from 50yds. to one mile, and although her
100yds. record has since been lowered by
Etheldra Bleibtrey, the American mermaid,
who will shortly visit us, every other record
is still standing. Fanny is the only Austra-
lian woman athlete to win a world’s athletic
championship, having annexed the 100
metres at the Stockholm Olympic in 1912.
She is hoping that she will have sufficiently
recovered from the effects of her illness and
the operation (which lost her her place in
the Australian Olympic team last year) to
compete against Miss Bleibtrey next Feb-
ruary. Her eel-like movements have so
attracted American film-producers that she
has been, approached by several magnates
with an idea of starring her as a Lorelei
on the silver sheet; but Fanny weighed the
offers, and then fled to home and mother.
When not swimming she can be depended
upon to be either dancing or thinking about
it —it is her second interest in life.
Marcia Williams was one of the prettv
bridesmaids of the week in old rose eharm-
euse and gold lace. The leading lady to
whom Marcia played second was Ivy Wil-
limette, of Evandale. Bonnyrigg (N.S.W.) ;
and she omitted none of the ingredients that
go. to make up the correct dressing for a
bride —satin, lace, tulle, a court train and
an armful of November lilies were all upon
her when she married her bridegroom, who
goes by the properous name of Silver King,
with Stanley prefixed. Ivy’s sister, Mrs.
Guy Boucher, entertained the wedding
guests; and the newly-weds are going to
watch the moon rise, “cheek to cheek on
mountain peak,’ as the old-fashioned song
says v for Stanley Silver King took his bride
to Kosciusko. With a name like that he
can afford to.
Dorothy Wall, who for two years has been
honorary secretary of St. Margaret’s Hos-
pital. Cleveland-street, was quietly married
at St. Mary’s during the 9-o’clock mass
on Y\ ednesday of last week. Bridegroom
was Dr. Frank J. Gwynne, from Newcastle,
and he went to the altar with brother Bede.
Dorothy faced the ordeal in cream tailor-
ings and silver tissue hat, and was
helped out by Mollie Hughes in pale
pink and delphinium blue frockmg.
Dorothy comes from Katoomba, and
dad and mother entertained the party
to a real wedding breakfast at the Carlton.
St. Margaret’s nurses had put on their best
bibs in Dorothy’s honor at a gift afternoon,
and on the Tuesday Mollie Hughes hostessed
another party at Farmer’s.
After waiting so long it was hard that
Madge Walford and Hector Nelson Baldry
(she needn’t be afraid of burglars witli a
warrior like that handy) should have their
wedding marquee swamped by the worst
December storm on record. All Saints’,
Y\ oollahra, blessed the vows, and Badre
l-angley collected the fee. Madge was sweet
in white satin and silver lace; and Hector
Nelson made a handsome bridegroom. Melanie
Collins, Nina Bead and Beth Bennett were
the bridesmaids and carried out their duties
in jade green, with yellow posies. Charlie
Baldry was best man, and Colonel Holland
and Dr. Broughton groomsmen. The party
(as much of it as wasn’t washed away) was
held at Milton, Madge’s Woollahra home.
That a pile of money goes up in smoke was
demonstrated by the dressing at the wedding
of cigar-king Marks’s daughter Belle, iii
spite of the floods, the Synagogue at six
thirty on Thursday was effulgent with the very
best brands of dry goods on the market. The
small dark bride, in a souffle of ivory tulle,
with taffeta hip puffs, a tulle train and a
tulle veil, looked like the Queen doll of a
Christmas tree, and stood bravely up to the
picturesque Jewish ceremony with her soldier-
boy, Itoy George Browne. Younger sister
Celia, in pink taffeta, with its panniers turn-
ing back to Brussels-lace lining, quite in the
W atteau style, and a small banking account
in the Dorothy Perkins roses on her arm,
followed in the wake of the bride, and with
her was small Ailsa Browne. Miss Bishop's
(the old Concordia Hall), in Elizabeth-street,
cleared its good floor for the jazzers’ feet,
and the Prince of the Monopoles and his
Consort saw to it that everything was flor
fina, not to say perfectos de luxe.
Dora, second daughter of the G. F. Earps,
didn’t let Friday’s blizzard prevent her keeping
her appointment with Instructor-Lieut. lfed-
nall, of H.M.A.S. Brisbane, at St. Mark’s,
Darling Point. Between an avenue of white
agapanthus and lilies the slim bride drew a
heavyweight of embroidered tulle and ivory
satin, the only rosy glow through the holy
dimness of the. church being thrown from
the pink tulle lining of the long court train.
Archdeacon D’Arcy Irvine performed his
part with neatness and despatch, and bride’s
sister Lilian kept an eye on the bridal gear
ii- the shade of blue that “Irene” has made
popular. The bridesmaid’s bloom-of-the
season, delphinium, together with Japanese
iris, formed Lilian’s bouquet. All Francis
Gibson Bednall’s navy pals came to the
sailor’s wedding, and Highgate, the Edgecliff
headquarters of the Earps, was brimming
over with guests, who, whatever their usual
occupation, might truthfully that day be
called seafaring. Bride’s mother fluctuated
between copper and rust shades in her
taffeta frocking.
The Society engagement of the week was
that of Joan McCall McGowan to Phil
Bowyer Smythe, Flag-Lieutenant of the Mel-
bourne. Joan is slim and dark and just 20.
She’s an only daughter, and up till last
Christmas was a pupil of Frensham at Mitta-
gong. Phil is an alert, clear-skinned young
man, and everybody is cooing over the
romance.
Marjorie, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. D. C.
K. Cameron, of Kensington Downs and
Southport (Q.), is bespoken to Lieut.
Charles Pitcairn Jones, 8.N., second son of
a late Admiral, whose widow has come to
anchor at Southampton (Eng.).
Mrs Moulden and her Mayor have
been over from Adelaide, and Usher’s har-
bored the lady’s high-voltage mentality and
the mayoral dignity until Sunday night,
when they could bear the monotony of the
rain on the roof no longer, and fled cheer-
fully back to Adelaide.
From Brisbane in a macintosh :
A pretty Melbourne girl, Edna Armytage, spent a
few days in Brisbane before flitting to India and
Singapore. The A. H. Whittinghams gave her a
dance and the Glynn Connollys a jazz. Mrs. Whit-
ting-ham hostessed several parties last week, one
being a dinner at Lennon’s on the first night of
‘•lrene.”
W. J. Vowles, leader of the Country party, wasn’t
worrying much about politics last week. His wife
has just undergone a nasty operation, and is now
improving.
Even worshippers of the perpetual grouch cannot
(so far) find fault with new Governor Sir Matthew
Nathan. He appears to be a soldierly,’ cheerful soul.
His hobby is polo, and Toowoomba, which bursts
into a carnival of polo once a rear, is beginning to
wonder whether he shouldn’t make his summer resi-
dence on the Downs. Incidentally, the new aide.
Captain Halbord, is a jazz artist, and made his first
appearance here at the Whittingham party for Edna
Armytage.
The day we welcomed the new Governor Mrs.
Theodore lunched Mrs. Lennon, the Ministers’ wives
and others at the Belle Vue. Flame-colored georgette
and pink carnations were the decorations.
Mrs. B. D. Morehead, who is now Mrs. Ogilvie
Mathieson, has been honeymooning in Scotlandr and
entertaining at the Mathieson shooting-box in Inver-
ness. She is the admirable hostess who used to dis-
pense hospitality at Cintra.
Reg Smith, M.C. and Croix de Guerre, a grand-
son of the late F. A. Anning, of Reeding Springs,
is shortly to marry Norma Flowerdru Lowson, mem-
ber of a sporting Gloucestershire family.
Ex-Speaker Cowley’s wife has been the guest of
honor at a tea given by the executive committee of
the Soldiers Comforts Funds and the conveners of
the various battalion funds. Mrs. J. S. P. Bourne
handed over a prettily-bound souvenir report of the
work done by the fund. One thing is quite certain.
The gratitude of hundreds of soldier men means more
to this splendid woman than the 0.8. E. that was
thrust upon her, and the gratitude will last as long
as a Queensland soldier his memory.
, This is Sydney’s original “Chocolate Sol-
dier.” Leslie Gaze, of Adelaide, went to
England to continue
his medical studies
in the years back,
and became a star
in opera instead,
lie lias sung leads
in London, and in
New York under the
Frohman manage-
ment at the Knick-
erbocker theatre.
He has appeared in
drama, too, one of
his successes being
in “An Englishman’s
Home.” But h e
wants to settle down,
so lie is determined to
get to work develop-
ing other people’s
voices. It is an old
idea of his, and he studied under Lawrason.
America’s leading voice producer, with an
eye to it. Meanwhile he is to make an' ap-
pearance with the State Orchestra. May
Moore took the photo.
The 19th Battalion Comforts Fund had its
final meeting last week. When the
treasurers (Mrs. Edward Knox and Mr. D.
H. Scott) looked into the cash box they found
still £4OO, so the meeting decided to endow a
bed at Prince Alfred’s in the name of the
19th Battalion.
The cakes for the Children’s Hospital com-
petition need not be delivered till this day
(Thursday) at noon. Lady Forster will
wave the glad eye over the fruity display at
12.30 by the clock.
The Children’s Hospital at Camperdown
wants Santa Clauses —a lot of them. If
you can’t Santa Claus in person, owing to
a date with your own babies, you can fill
a stocking by proxy.
The Ascham fete was an abandoned female
on Saturday. Tennis-match, Christmas-tree
and the finery she was to have been adorned
with were snatched from her by the ruthless
male hands of rain and wind, and, like Marie
Tempest’s Outcast, she was thrown over by
her lover, of the preceding week. But the
Sydney Hospital Auxiliary is once more
fluttering an eyelid at the lady, and the fete
is to be decked and fussed over and cooed to
probably on Thursday or Friday of this
week. So ticket-holders are advised not
to throw their bob’s worth into the waste-
paper basket.
This year the Soldiers’ Club is celebrating
its sixth Christmas, and the trustees want ro
make it a real Christmas for the A.1.F.-ers
and ex-Imperial-Service men who look upon
the club as their Sydney headquarters. The
secretary will be delighted to receive dona-
tions of suitable gifts and provisions for the
Christmas dinner.
Flora Sandes, riding crop, lieutenant’s
uniform and all, is off to visit her sister at
Oakwood, near Inverell. When Flora walks
down the front street in her Serbian glory
on shopping night, Inverell is going to have
one of the little thrills of its life. But, alas,
spite of her uniform, she can’t cut out the
Eve within her altogether. When last seen
on the Mosman boat she was ruining the
entire discipline of. her military outfit by
carrying a small suit-case covered with the
gayest chintz. In the New Year she sails
back to her beloved Serbia.

N point of beauty, purity of tone and respon-
sive action the horizontal piano has always
been recognised as the peer of the upright. It
conforms to more mechanical laws. The world’s mas-
ter musicians, in private and public, use nothing else.
The main barrier, however, to the more universal sale
of short horizontal grands, hitherto, has been their
price. To-day that barrier does no't exist. The Beale
Home Grand is an instrument possessing all the
attributes of horizontal construction. Yet it sells
for the same price asked for a high-grade upright.
The technical reasons for the superiority of horizontal pianos are
very interesting. Write for descriptive literature.

A\ .G. : Why those Yankee phrases, “tried
out” and “held down”—he “tried out” one job and
“held down” another? American literature is all
right (sometimes) ; but American colloquialisms are
often the result of the struggle of newly arrived
foreigners to speak English.... Crows Nest: In
The Bulletin people don’t come “out here.” This
is in; other places are out. .. .R.W.: Thanks; but
why didn’t you send your credentials before?....
M’boro: Corser was visiting the Murray settlements
when tile division was taken; he announced on his
return that he would have voted for expulsion....
L.J.D.: \ our murderous yarn doesn’t hang nicely...
T.S.C.: “Revellers” verse is not the same.... Poppy:
Far too little there.... Friendless: Not quite....
Ethel II.: The verse lacks the necessary charm.... Isa-
belM.: Not up. .. Webfoot: Nothing in it.. .G.P.M.:
Doesn’t sound like anything an Australian ever said.
Dryad: It hasn’t the feeling E.C.D.: Poor
verse; thin ideas J.B. (Fitzroy) : Not for u 5....
L.P.J.: Doesn’t make us want to embrace it....
J.M.R.: Verse about going to sea no use. Also it’s
no use choosing an unprintable sign for a pen-name.
... .Eric F.: It may be the weather; anyhow, “Com-
plaint” didn’t raise a smile Gem Gold: Too much
like the road to Dublin T.D.: Let the frightful
indictment go:—
Well, we’ll confess that on Sundays we suffer terrible
pangs of conscience S.C.W.: George Reid’s. It
lasted 61 months 10 days. Parke.,’s best (’7B-’B3)
ran 48 months 14 days Jungle: That’s just what
it is. Comb out your brains and try again....
G. : ‘.Secret Page” fails... .Guy: In its present
form Ode to a Dead Moustache” is too crude. . .
J. : Rubbish.... L.P.F.: Don’t care for ‘‘Remem-
brance’ . . . . Masfield F. : Poor verse on a print-worn
theme H.W.R. : You haven’t the skill Ber-
nard A.: “Return from Calvary” only says things
that have been said several million times and says
them in poor verse Lux: Don’t like them..].
Paul M.: Neither scores.... Corkscrew: The mirth
and the verse both move too heavily.... Firley:
Nothing to shout about A.P.F.: Not up....
K. : Weary yarn about nothing much. .. .Alice
H. : Must go back A.D.0.: Abuse of that sort
cheers us Frank N.: None of them matter
Senex: You might do better F.R.Y.: Dull yarn
with no point.... Bellerive: The tragic item calls
for tears: —
....Mary Jane: They’re not bad, but none of them
screams for print... . G.E.8.: That ground has been
covered too often.... B.W. (Kensington): No use
to us. By the way, why have you abolished the
definite article? F.A.M.: Yarn no good. . .A.8.C.:
Not enough in “Picture” Enid H. : Not quite
what we want. . . .L.J.W.: “Double Tragedy” nearly;
the rest poor. . . .A.W.V.K.: “Dome’s Woman” only
needs a pound more punch.... B.O.: “Lance-Jack”
incident too slight L.P.J.: “Prodigal” hopeless.
Kate O.: Melancholy story about baronet’s son
carrying his swag. We have known the same article
gleefully carried by a baronet himself.... Hannibal:
“The Piano Tuner” is too long and too loose. He
might be a commercial proposition if you put him
through, say, the woolpress. . . .0.A.P.: Things of
that kind haven’t much of a market here.... M.
Plen : No. .. . A.J.M.G.: Bits of “Home” sing well;
but its changes strain even an irregular metre to
bicaking point... .S.U.W.: Well, why shouldn’t he?
... . 1 emtree; If it’s a meat diet that makes you
write like that, for heaven’s sake take to peanuts...
B.: Sorry; “Outward” goes back. The verse is
handled nicely, but the thought runs very thin....
Sentimental B.: You ask “What whiskers?” Regret
that some pages have been torn out of our natural-
history book ; but so far as we can compile a list it
includes barley, lions, cats, oats, men, tigers and
some other women, cheese and jokes.... F.C.C.: If
The \\ hine had started as well as it finished it
would have scratched through.... Furry: Read it
aloud to yourself, and if it doesn’t make your ear
ache then you haven’t got an ear.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.H.A.: Wooden figures adorning a fence and a
rocking-horse splattering the brains of a club-footed
bloke don’t appeal. .. .V.D.K.: No need to tell us
that you are only a beginner. But there’s no rea-
son why you should also be an ender. .. .P.H.A.:
Ever seen wind blow smoke one way and rain
another?. .. .M.F. : “Dreaming” is a nightmare....
A.S.: Looks like an interior of a Noah’s-ark.
N.J.: Not a prospect in the batch H.W.: The
joke has whiskers R.M.C.: Raw art.. . .F.J.K.:
Quite hopeless for cartoon purposes.... M.P.: Feeble
scratchings L.P.: Kiddies with starfish hands and
detachable legs are not admitted to the family....
R.H.: A very old ’un.
Tho X. S. Wales p.c. loan of £3,000,000
started proudly with these subscriptions :■ —
State Superannuation Board . . . . £183,500
N.S.AV. Government Savings Bank . . 150,000
Both these institutions are under Govern-
ment control, or at least influence. Both
are using trust funds. On the day when
the subscriptions were reported there were
on the market Federal securities with the
credit of all Australia behind them which
paid 0 p.c. instead of p.c., and were sell-
ins: at £94 instead of £100; and there were
tax-free 54 p.c. N.S.W. State securities
available at £94 10s. It is all very well
to want to make a success of a N. S. Wales
State loan; but have trustees a right to
sacrifice any of their clients’ income in order
to do it? And if they do it, is Lang justi-
fied in boasting about it?
Dear Bulletin, you’re greedy for pars.,
And all that kind of fun;
Then why not go to the planet Mars,
For a delightful pun ?
For here on earth we scarce can please you,
As we our best send forth ;
Oh, how we'd love to tightly squeeze you
When to j print them you’re loath.
We dig deep and delve and sweat ourselves,
Trying to catch the muse,
Eyeing every bard upon our shelves,
Fearing still you’ll abuse.
Shots in a mansion were heard in the night.
Through a window a burglar did take to flight.
At the foot of a stairs an aged man lay dead ;
In a duel with the crook he was shot through the
head.
He’d fired and missed and the miscreant replied,
In defence of he’s goid the game veteran died.
Alas, in life’s sere and yellow leaf
Slain by the hand of a desperate thief!

The New Edison
“The Phonograph with a soul.”
Mr. Edison spent seven years and £625.000 in bringing the New Edison to
the point of perfect realism.
The New Edison causes you the same emotions as the voice of the living

orchestra. The Mew Edison has the perfect realism that baffles you to
detect the original from its Re-Creation.

EOUGH around the Leeuwin!
How quick the mind can roam :

The lion stands at bay
To beat them by,
And tosses high
An angry mane of spray.

A False Scent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ROBE pulled down the sliprails
I and led his sweat-stained horse along
the track that dribbled away towards
a decrepit shack. He wiped the perspiration
from, his face. “Come ’n Prince,” he hissed,
as the chestnut dragged on the reins.
A lean tender yapped perfunctorily as Ted
approached. A verandah poked out from
tne front of the slab bunding, hanging loosely
on four spidery posts. And there was a
ravelled strip of vine.
Suddenly tne verandah creaked, the
emaciated posts trembled, and a massive
block of a man dropped from the shadows.
Batches of a hard, cruel face, with two
black, beady eyes, gleamed from among a
clutching sandy beard.
• “ ’Day,” he grunted.
“Goo’ day,” replied Ted.
“Bit warm, eh?”
Ted was too busy hitching his horse to the
fence to hear. He followed the other into
the cool twilight of the verandah. Neither
spoke for a moment. Ted pulled out his p.pe.
“Yer ’aven’t seen a black ’orse, a stray ’un,
about ’ere, ’ave yer?” asked Ted. .
Sandy Whiskeis was craning his neck to-
wards the blistering sky.
“D’yer think it’ll rain?” he asked irrele-
vantly.
"Dunno,” lisped Ted.
“By golly,” grunted Whiskers—“by golly,
we could do with a drop of juice now.
Damned dry !”
It was dry. The flat was livid. It pulsed
feverishly through the haze and shimmering
heat. Sparse patches of withered grass, hot
and brittle, shone on the vast gravelly waste.
Dust hung everywhere, coining in panting
breaths from the baked earth.
Whiskers clambered back to the verandah.
His forehead was furrowed deeply, and his
eyes shrank back beneath the bristling brows,
lie was obviously wrestling with some deep
problem ; the ponderous head had sunk into
his upraised palm.
-“Yer didn’t see a stray ’orse about ’ere, did
yer?” Ted thumped this time with the loud
pedal down. But the hairy bundle of
humanity before him. remained as distant and
as unresponsive as a dream. His gaze re-
mained on the floor; and his fingers played
hide-and-seek among the pit's in his beard.
“Oh, you w r as sayin’ somethin’—yes, about
a stray ’orse. No, we’ve never seen it ’ere.”
“Damn that liorse!” muttered Ted.
The old fellow shook himself. Mere
thinking acted upon him like an opiate. As
the tedium of the slow, crude ratiocination
wore off, his beady eyes brightened.
Rope hovered on the edge of the verandah,
Undecided.
The old fellow hollered at something back
of the house. An urchin, his hair clamped
about a smutty face, pattered around the
verandah corner.
“ ’Arness the ole mare in the dray.” said
Whiskers. “We’ll get that ’ay in.”
“Wot’s Ben doin’?” wailed the urchin.
“Can’t lie do”— —
“By ’ell ! By ’ell! Billy,” and the old
fellow lumbered towards him. “I’ll give”—
His big bulky frame was suddenly convulsed
with spluttering. A fly had buzzed into his
mouth.
At a safe distance Billy put his thumb to
his nose and then vanished from sight. The
old man turned to Rope, and shook liis head
deprecatingly. The kid was hopeless.
From out of the haze on the flat drifted the
plaintive bleating of weakened sheep. Huge
clouds of dust rolled towards them. Patches
of sheep showed intermittently through the
drab veil. The two small black eyes began io
twinkle in the old fellow’s head.
“By ’ell, that woman ’ll settle ’em,” he
moaned. “I oughter ’ave done it meself, but
—but it’s too much for a man. By ’ell, look
at that. Never get married. Take my ad-
vice.”
Ted paled a trifle. As those admonitory
words swam through his head the present
fell away from him like a sloughing skin.
He was back six years—married then. Those
days and nights were the • sweetest
hours of his life. And then he had come
one night and had found his wife missing. He
had neither seen nor heard of her since.
Dead? But how? For a time his soul was
bruised and pained; he- was buffete-d by a
swarm of grim dreads and fancies. But they
had gradually drifted away. The darkness
of those anguished days had passed like
yesterday’s night. It had long been for-
gotten.
-“Never get married!” —the words brought
it all back.
The whirls of dust came nearer. Rope
caught a glimpse of a red scarf fluttering
from the woman’s neck.
Whiskers shambled to the fence. “Easy
there! Easy there, damyer!” he shouted.
But with a rapid scurrying of legs, the
sheep, the horse and the red scarf broke
quickly past the house.
Then the woman herself came towards the
verandah, approaching behind Ted’s back.
“ ’Aven’t I told yer to go easy with them
sheep?” barked Whiskers. “By ’ell! By
’ell!” —his words fainted into incoherency.
“Yer always gettin’ ” —a sob choked' the
rest. It was a sharp-edged voice vibrating
with terror.
Rope turned. She was a trembling wraith,
old far beyond her years. There was a
wizened face riven with suffering—pale,
shrunken, skeleton-like.
She took an involuntary step back. The
glistening eyes stared vacuously. Her tem-
perament, naturally shy and hypochrondriac,
quailed before a stranger. Gradually the
gaping mouth and eyes subsided.
“Wot’s up wid yer?” growled the old
fellow. “He’s after a stray ’orse. Yer
’aven’t seen a strange ’orse ’bout, ’ave yer t

above a whisper.
Rope was riled.
“I’ll get along,” he snapped. “I thought
I’d just drop in, in case you’d seen somethin’
of that flamin’ ’orse.”
lie shuffled down the cranky steps. As he
passed through the gate he turned to the
strange couple, and
“Wait,” cried the woman. “I think I
know” —and she passed the corner of the
verandah out of sight.
She was back quickly, caracoling on a
flea-bitten grey.
“Wot’s up now, eh?” thundered Whiskers.
She fumbled with the reins; and her eyes
blinked at Rope. The sparse words fell from
her lips indistinct and shattered. Something
within her seemed gripping tight, tighter.
Her voice rose higher. “I’m—we’re goin’
after the ’orses,” she struggled again. “I —
I think I saw a stranger among ours yester-
day.” , „ .
“You’re goin to stop where y are, fie
roared, stepping towards the grey.
Rope hung irresolute against the fence. A
cluster of black cockatoos screeched over-
head. Whiskers watched them. “I think
we’ll ’ave some rain, after all,” he muttered.
With a bound the grey broke away. “Come
on,” cried the woman back over her shoulder.
Ted hesitated ; he watched the old fellow
slowly curse his way back through the fence
towards the verandah. Then he rode'after
the red scarf.
Neither spoke. The woman’s eyes played
furtively about him. She seemed troubled.
She appeared to oscillate between a desire
for conversation and silence. But Rope
never gave her a thought. His gaze was
drawn to the far away. To regain his horse
and to get away was all he desired. The
woman at his side had faded to impalpability.
Up out of the distance rushed the grizzled,
ragged gums. The wind hissed. .Hoof-beats
throbbed monotonously through his deadened
bra in.
The agitation behind the flapping red scarf
increased.
“I d : dn’t think you’d come.” she sa : d at
last. Her voice showed signs of the hesitancy
and awkwardness of a child. There was a
fluttering moment.
Ted Rope stopped.
“Don’t you know me? Six years”
Rope’s eyes swam. He caught some, words,
something about six years ago and his wife.
“Ed!” wailed the broken voice. “For
pity’s sake, take me back —back again.”
Ted fought with something in his throat.
“You’re Ann!” he gasped. Then he sat
stark still, gripped by a cataleptic numbness.
His wife! Heavens!
For a moment he felt the hardships that
had so cruelly battered the wraith before
him. Then the ugly grim visage back in the
shack came between them. It was for that
wild, hairy beast that she had left him ! She
that he had adored! _
His god had proved to be a false idol; and
idols should be... . destroyed !
He struggled to control himself.
“Isn’t the ’orse ’ere, then?” he asked, and
his voice sank into a hollow whine.
“No,” she groaned.
She stretched her arms imploringly to-
wards him.
“Take me back, Ed,” she screamed. ‘For
God’s sake do. . . .do. . . .do !”
Ted Rope pulled his chestnut back on to its
haunches. He glanced at her trembling body
on the ground.
There was a taut moment. The woman
sobb°d. _
“Blast that ’orse!” he said. “But 111 find
the cow yet.”
Then he was gone.
The woman cried in a frenzy of grief, and
’••using her bead listened avidly to the
drum of the lioof-beats faint'ng through the
syrupy glow of the waning afternoon.
DEIRDRE.
A Terrible Bad Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DANE and Langton, apprised of the
fact that in two years the gold
yield of Victoria had jumped from
145,0000 z. to 3,150,0000 z., had combined to
secure their share of the dazzling mass, and
had sunk a somewhat spiral shaft at Sheeps-
head Flat. Mt. Alexander, where 300
limited companies, combinations of two,
were shouldering each other awkwardly in
a deuce of a hurry to tear the heart out of
the scrap of land the mining laws allowed
them. The Government of the day, with
the amiable intention of making the good
things go as far as possible among the clam-
ant population of miners, had limited the
individual allowance of auriferous land to
just the area in which a small cat could be
swung, and mines were wedged in like the
squares of a not very tremendous draught-
board, with the natural result that bounds
were continually being overstepped and regu-
lations defied. The frequent hand-to-hand
combats that resulted were limited by the
precariously small fields immediately avail-
able for such exercises, and by the likeli-
hood of the contest terminating at the bot-
tom of a 40ft. hole, each combatant finding
himself permanently indisposed with a broken
neck or temporarily with a fractured leg.
Next to Dane and Langton along the lay
of the lead were Cricket and Godby, com-
parative newchums. There had been no
shepherding on Sheepshead: the richness
of the surrounding country and the big haul
made by the discoverers of the flat had set
the diggers burrowing like frightened porcu-
pines eager for coven. Neither Cricket nor
Godby had thrown a pick nor flourished a
shovel before confine to the field three weeks
earlier; consequently as a result of natural
ignorance and rash haste their shaft was zig-
zag where Dane’s was spiral.
“One advantage of a shaft like she” —
Cromer, the old Californian, spat a stream
of tobacco-juice into Danby’s mine—“is that
anv durned in-e-bri-ate could walk down
her on his hands.”

not acting right. The kidneys need help occasionally,
just as the bowels need help. A dull, nagging backache;
soreness, lameness and sharp, sudden pains are all
symptoms of neglected kidneys. You may have head-

SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
A WATERLOO RESIDENT.
Mrs. W. Sullivan, 2 Brisbane Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“l suffered
terribly with my kidneys for some time. I had terrible pains in my back, and could
hardly move without suffering torture. Every time I stooped I would get a twinge
across my kidneys ike the stab of a knife, and I could not help screaming out. I
was also subject to bad headaches, dizzy feelings, and had urinary trouble, the
.secretions being thick and cloudy, and difficult to pass. Nothing I took seemed to
suit my case, and I suffered on in spite of treatment, but at last I got a good remedv

course of these pills, which I did, and I am pleased to say they cured me of everv

Tom Godby laughed with the others. “It’s
only our second,’ said he, "and we w T ere in
a particular hurry to touch bottom.”
So, boldin’ that the longest way round
is the nearest way there, you took turnin’s
like the per-am-bu-lations of ol’ Danno
Docket when he’s drunk a tub o’ rum.”
iom Godby and his mate were not so
eager now. They were among the later
comers up the rise. The sinking here was
roni 40ft, to 60ft., whereas the gutter on
the flat was cut at 30ft. The latter was
often scandalously rich—“lousy with it,” in
vernacular—while the deep sinking
ottered no adequate compensations. Godby
bottomed on the wash, but
the first tub had yielded only a few ’weights,
and their enthusiasm had exhausted itself
1, e a . Sflotb- They continued working on
the off-chance of hitting on a big bit, as had
nappened in two or three instances among
the claims surrounding them ; but Tom Godby
was like a man who had lost hope
and who accepted ill-luck as his inevit-
able portion. He was under 30, a
v W 1 -l)iilit, lean-limbed, good-looking English-
man, whose clean-cut features and closely-
shaven. rather pale face contrasted in a start-
ing- way with the rugged, weather-beaten,
hea\ ilj-whiskered chins of the diggers who
were his neighbors. And now Godby’s tight
line ol mouth and the trouble in his fixed
stare told his tale. Tom was a' bad loser,
or his losing was more significant than in
I lie case of the ordinary, unhampered, devil-
may-care miners swarming on the Mount.
Jack Dane and Langton were men of a
totally different type. They regarded them-
selves as Australians, having been in the
country, roughing it on cattle-stations, for
se\oral years before the diggings broke out;
but they, too. were new to the game—a
couple of five-foot-ten, bony, hairy, hard-
baked blackguards, lovers of rum. gamblers
and noisy in their drink. It was Jack Dane’s
fixed belief that he in particular was a very
bad man. As yet he had never done any
man a serious injury, but he was terrified
to think what lie might do if roused.
"I s’pose there ain’t a worse devil than
me in all Australia,’ said Jack one night in
Mrs. Drake’s slianty-bar. He was regard-
ms mm self moodily in an old, cracked mirror
on, the bark wall as he spoke. “And I look
tI 10 a fifi ( kl- “I’m a terrible bad man.”
“Ever ate anybody?” queried the Cali-
fornian. “Yes, ever ate anybody?” he re-
peated in response to Dane’s amazed expres-
sion. i
“Mell. no. I've fell short of eatin’ ’em,”
J a ck I )alie admitted.
"Well, don’t think nothink ex-cessive of 1
yerself as a reg'Jar devil till yeh have.”
"There's nothin’ I would‘stop at,” Dane
went on. “il any one was to get me monkey
fair up.” The insinuation was that he
might even eat his enemy if tried too far. 1
“I’ve bin in gaol fer lamin’ a Chinaman, and
—oh, yes. no use for to argue; I’m a
bad lot.” I To picked a bottle off Mrs. Drake’s
counter and hurled it into the fireplace to :
convince any doubter, if doubter remained.
Most of this was drink, but there may
have been beii'nd it some sly idea of impress-
ing Jimmb* Cricket, who was among those i
present. Dane and Langton were at dag-
gers drawn with Cricket and Godby. The i
row had begun over the extent of their
respective claims, it had been accented by
the loss of a shovel, and it culminated in
a fight between Dane and Godby—a brief,
floundering battle that ended when Dane
went headlong into his own shaft, then only
seven-feet deep fortunately. But an implac-
able animosity was supposed to exist between
the two parties, and Dane particularly, when
fired with an extra helping of old Jamaica,
simply sat and wondered at his forbear-
ance in not having torn Godby limb from
limb.
“How a man of my murderous disposi-
tion puts up with it I dunno,” he told his
mate.
“Some day, p’raps,” said Langton con-
solingly, “afore it’s all over, you may have
his blood on yer ’ands.” Langton, too. arthough
of a much milder disposition, believed he
would be a hard man in a row; not as
unscrupulous as Tom, perhaps, but rough
and cruel. He did not know for certain, he
had never been tried, but lie could look “ter-
rible fierce” when the mood took him. It
was suspected by men like Cromer that
Langton was only making a poor bid to live
up to his mate.
So the two parties worked through two
45ft. shafts where one shaft would have
served had commonsense existed between
them —worked almost in touch with one an-
other, and never exchanged a civil word.
Then a stroke of good luck which might
have softened Dane’s iron heart fell to the
lot of Dane and Langton. They were work-
ing the wash, taking out about four feet
of it, and doing only fairly, when Langton
forked up the Great Chain nugget, a lovely
3130 z. in three rigid links of pure gold, which
at £3 ss. an oz., the price ML Alexander gold
was bringing then, meant something over a
thousand.
Dane and Langton played cunning. They
now desired another claim in the deeper
ground at Sheepshead, but if their find
were made known every foot on the hill
would be pegged out. So they stowed the
beauty away, and kept their secret for the
time being. But towards the end the oppor-
tunity of playing off an egregious joke on
Godby and Cricket proved too much for
Dane’s discretion. The last strokes were
being pu 4pin ; the barrier between them and
Godby’s underground workings would be
broken down in the next few blows of the
picks. . Godby and his mate were working
on their side. Godby broke through, and there
was Dane down on his knees, with protrud-
ing eyes, and a face lit with a mad sort
of exultation, hanging on to a huge nugget
apparently embedded right on the border-
line between the two claims. It was the
first really satisfactory display of gold
Godby had beheld, and he wanted gold
badly.
“Get back!” lie cried, threatening Dane
with his pick. “That’s on our claim !”
“Wouldn’t you like it fer your tie-pin?”
retorted Dane derisively. He tore the nugget
from the swash, and Godby hurled himself
upon the prize.
Cricket and Langton beat down the re-
mainder of the dividing wall of gravel, and
fought fiercely. Langton was knocked in-
sensible, and Cricket lay back on the p:pe-
clay floor of the workings, badly lamed.
Dane and Godby fought like tigers over a
bone, till the latter got a blow at his oppo-
nent with the nugget. Then Godby went down,
the blood flowing from a cut in his head. At
that moment Dane felt he had justified his
estimate of himself as a thoroughly bad
man.
Jack Dane was drawn to the surface by
a couple of diggers from a neighboring
claim, and presently half the men on the
lead were gathered about the wonderful
nugget. The injured diggers were brought
to the surface, and the disputation was
resumed, Godby putting in a fierce claim to
some share of the nugget. He declared that
at least half of it had lain on his holding.
An impartial committee of investigation,
led by Cromer, went below, with Dane and
Godby. The bed of the nugget was pointed
out, measurements were taken, and it was
demonstrated that the nugget was wholly
the property of Langton and Dane, having
lain just half an inch short of encroaching
on Godby’s claim.
“It fair knocked Godby head over tip,
that and the clip on the head I give him,”
Dane explained to his mate later. “He
went the color of a candle, and jist curled
up. They’ve took him home.”
Langton w 7 as on his bunk in the tent, still
sick from the welt Cricket had given him.
For a man of so inveterately cruel a dispo-
sition he bore little malice.
“Godby’s got a wife,” he remarked to
Dane. “And a new kiddy. I hear.”
“So I’m bearin’,” said Dane. A little of
the satisfaction seemed to go out of his vic-
tory. He hid the nugget away.
Presently Langton spoke again. “ ’Twasn’t
much of a joke, I don’t think,” said he.
“Not what you’d call a great joke.”
Dane did not answer, but he was surprised
to find the jest appearing far less humorous
than he had expected.
It was Langton put it to Dane a week
later. They had secured a new claim, and
Godby and Cricket had gone further up the
lead. “Come ’long o’ me a step,” he said.
“Wanter show yeh somethin’.”
Dane followed, with some petulant reflec-
tions on his mate’s absurd idiosyncrasies,
but Langton answered never a word. He
brought Jack to the window of Godby's
slab hut, and directed him to peep in. Dane
obeyed. After a moment he turned away,
lingered, and went back to the calico win-
dow, peering through a rip in the material.
The two mates walked home in silence.
It was an hour later that Dane the devil
said in the most casual voice he could
assume: “ ’Pears to be a fine sorter kid.”
“Pertickler fine kid,” Langton admitted.
Another quarter of an hour passed. Lang-
ton had taken Dane’s last trick. Dane’s
euchre had been childlike.
“But the mother looks what I’d call
peaky,” said Jack.
“Most awful peaky.” Langton admitted.
“Never saw a peakier.”
“ 'Twas wantin’ money for her made him
so fierce, the Californian tells me.”
Another silence. The euchre game had ’
been abandoned. It was Dane spoke again.
He had got into the blankets, and blown out
the candle.
“Bill!”
“Well, what?”
“I sometimes wisht I wasn’t sieh a ter-
rible said Jack Dane.
It was on the following Sunday morning
that Dane and Langton presented themselves
at Godby’s door.
“We been talkin’ this ’ere matter over,
me ’n’ Langton,” said Dane, “and we’ve
come to the conclusion that if everyone had
their rights you’d have a cut at that nugget.”
Young Godby, leaning on the jamb, re-
garded them coldly. “What is your game?”
said he.
“That nugget was as near as dammit
yours. We reckon that, all things consid-
ered, about three inches of it was yours, and
we’re willin’ to let her go at that.”
Godby’s eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened.
“That has all been settled,” he said, “and
I don’t want any man’s damned charity, if
that’s what you are driving at. You clear!”
Dane and Langton went away.
“Did yeh hear the kiddy cryin’?” asked
Dane late in the afternoon.
“I did. And I heard her.”
“It’s years since I seen a kiddy.” Then
after another prolonged silence: “It’s nothin'
to skite about, bein’ a hell iv a bad man.”
Cromer took the news to Godby and
Cricket. “It seems there’s bin a pe-cu-li-nr
mistook,” said he. “After all, you do git a
cut-in at the Great Chain.”
Godby laid a> hand on the Californian’s
arm. “Is this straight?” he said, and a red
spot suddenly flamed in the hollows of his
white face.
“It’s straight ez a die. I reckon we acted
kinder foolish measurin’ her up the way we
did. We measured from each shaft below,
not allowin’ fer the ec-cen-tric-it-ies iv the
ammertoor. Now we finds Dane’s shaft* is
out of plumb good seven inches, yours is
out five inches half-way down, rights her-
self, so to speak, ’n’ goes another three or
four out; but when all’s squared up math-
er-mat-i-cal-ly co-rect, Dane’s workin’s is
showin’ a matter iv three and a half inches
encroachment, maltin' three inches of that
nugget yours in-alien-ab-ly.”
“And how does Dane take this?”
“Oh, he rears up back and front, but we
puts it to him it’s either ante up some or we
starts a action fer trespass with crim-i-nal
intent for to il-legally po-sess, and he caves
in.”
The nugget was cut with an axe blade and
a sledge hammer on the smith’s anvil at
Sheepshead, and Godby and Cricket’s three
inches yielded £3BO. Mrs. Godby was sent to
Melbourne, and the day Godby got word to
say she was rapidly getting well in the new
doctor’s hands he encountered the Californian
sitting on his tip. masticating tobacco, and
taking pot shots at a lame grasshopper.
“Cromer,” Godby said, “who was it put you
up to the idea of those shafts being out of
plumb?”
Cromer considered a moment, hit his mark,
rubbed his jaw for effect, and then replied in
a long drawl: “In a roundabout way it was
that ’ere son of a gun Jack Dane.” Then with
a twinkle he added: “By Gawd, there’s a
terrible hell iv a bad man, if you like!”
