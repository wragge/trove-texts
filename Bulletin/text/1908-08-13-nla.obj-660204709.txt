The Red Page
The Over-Seas Bard .
LET us consider the sort of poetry
that the other British races are
producing just now. America has
Edwin Markham, who wrote * ‘ The Man
witli the Hoe,” and has written nothing
poetical else, and George Sylvester Viereck,
a much over-boomed bard. His Nineveh
and other Poems (Brown, Langham, Lon-
don), is made up of blank pages and
pages full of words, but bare of poetry.
Half-a-dozen of these poems are worth
while ; the rest is suet-pudding. His
“ Nineveh” opens with a sonnet upon New
York which has a kind of forced, feeble
strength :
Huge steel-rilibed monsters rise into the air
Her Babylonian towers, while on high
Like gilt-scaled serpents glide the swift trains by,
Or, underfoot, creep to their secret lair.
A thousand lights are jewels in her hair,
The sea her girdle, and her crown the sky,
Her life-blood throbs, the fevered pulses fly,
Immense, defiant, breathless she stands there
And ever listens in the ceaseless din,
Waiting for him, her lover who shall come,
Whose singing lips shall boldly claim their own
And render sonant what in her was dumb :
The splendor and the madness and the sin,
) Her dreams in iron and her thoughts of stone.
But Viereck, though he most valiantly
woos, is not that lover. He intends to be
modern ; and in the quatrains of “Nineveh”
he displays a viewpoint strangely like that in
Arthur H. Adams’ London Streets. For in-
stance, these stanzas might almost have been
looked for in Adams’ “ Hyde Park ” :
Through the long alleys of the park
On noiseless wheels and delicate springs,
Glide painted women, fair and dark,
Bedecked with silks and jewelled things.
In peacock splendor goes the,rout
With shrill, loud laughter of the mad—
Red lips to suck the life-blood out,
And eyes too weary to be sad !
But, as a whole, the poem cannot be com-
pared with London Streets —and this critical
estimate will doubtless be accepted at its
worth when it is admitted that the present
critic is the author of London Streets. And
beyond “ Nineveh ” there is little of dis-
tinction in the book except the titles of his
poems: “A Ballad of Sin,” “The Book of
Idols,” “The Ballad of Nun and Knight,”
“ The Three Sphinxes.” Viereck does not
mind saying dreary things like this :
Yet I went still onward, undeterred,
Ever onward, ever, ever onward,
Onward, onward through the darkling town.
And at last I came where stands thy dwelling ;
Ever slower grew my lagging footsteps,
Ever slower.
which is an easy way of making six lines do
duty for one ; or trite things like this :
For who shall speak with the raging flame,
Or stay the cataract in its leap ?
Yet he occasionally finds the good phrase.
As thus, in a sonnet to Swinburne :
Is it the sea that thunders in his song,
Or it his song reverberates in the sea?
\f/
But it is only occasionally, in fact, only in
this one poem, that Viereck strikes with a
sure hand the note of human passion.
THE HAUNTED HOUSE.
I lay beside you ... on your lips the while
Hovered, most strange . . . the mirage of a smile,
Such as a minstrel lover might have seen
Upon the visage of some antique queen
Flickering like flame, half-choked by wind and
dust,
Weary of all things, saving song and lust.
How many days and years and lovers’ lies
Gave you your knowledge? You are very wise
And tired, yet insatiate to the last.
These things I thought, but said not; and there
passed
Before my vision in voluptuous quest,
The pageant of the lovers who possessed
Your soul and body even as I possess,
Who marked your passion in its nakedness,
And all your love-sins when your love was new.
They saw as I your quivering breast, and drew
Nearer to the consuming flame that burns
Deep to the marrow of my bone, and turns
My heart to love even as theirs who knew
From head to girdle each sweet curve of you,
Each little way of loving. No caress,
But apes the part of former loves. Ah, yes,
Even thus your hand toyed in the locks of him
Who came before me, Was he fair of limb
Or very dark ? What matter, with such lures
You snared the heart of all your paramours !
To-night I feel the presence of the others,
Your lovers were they and are now my brothers ;
And I have nothing that has not been theirs,
No single bloom the tree of passion bears
They have not plucked. Beloved, can it be?
Is there no gift that you reserve for me—
No loving kindness or no subtle sin,
No secret shrine that none has entered in,
Whither no mocking memories pursue
Love’s wistful pilgrim ? lam weary too,
With weariness of all your lovers, and when
I follow in the ways of other men,
I know each spot of your sweet body is
A cross, the tombstone of some perished kiss.
With all its beauty and its faultless grace
Your body, dearest, is a haunted place.
When I did yield to passion’s swift demand.
One of your lovers touched me with his hand.
And in the pang of amorous delight
I hear strange voices calling through the night.

Alfred Noyes is doing good work in his
epic, Drake; but his occasional verse is dis-
appointing. His latest collection, Forty
Singing Seamen and Other Poems (Black-
wood), is of the commonplace-cultured
quality that is regularly turned out by most
of the English minors. In his lyrics he is a
sort of English Ogilvie, stringing off faintly
pretty phrases with a fatal ease. It is only
in his ballads that Noyes becomes interest-
ing; and in this volume “The Highwayman”
is excellently done. It starts thus, stir-
ringly :
The wind was a torrent of darkness among the
gusty trees.
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon
cloudy seas.
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the
purple moor.
And the highwayman came riding—riding—
riding—
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-
door.
“The Forty Singing Seamen” is equally
delightful.
Across the seas of Wonderland to Mogadore we
plodded,
Forty singing seamen in an old black barque . . .
But he took us through his palace and, my lads, as
I’m a sinner, ,
We walked into an opal like a sunset-colored
cloud—
“My dining-room,” he says, and, quick as light
we saw a dinner
Spread before us by the fingers of a hidden fairy
crowd ;
And the skipper, swaying gently
After dinner, murmurs faintly,
“I looks to-wards you, Prester John, you’ve
done us very proud ! ”.
Chorus : And we drank his health with honors,
for he done us very proud ! . . .
. . . But that forest fair defied us—
First a crimson leopard laughs at us most hor-
rible to see.
Then a sea-green lion came and sniffed and licked
his chops and eyed us,
While a red and yellow unicorn was dancing
round a tree !
We was trying to look thinner,
Which was hard, because our dinner
Must ha’ made us very tempting to a cat o’ high
degree!
Chorus : Must ha’ made us very tempting to the
whole menajeree ! . . .
Across the seas of Wonderland to London-town
we blundered,
Forty singing seamen as was puzzled for to
know
If the visions that we saw was caused by—here
again we pondered—
A tipple in a vision forty thousand years ago.
Could the grog we dreamt we swallowed
Make us dream of all that followed ?
We were only simple seamen, so of course we
didn’t know ! v
Chorus : We were simple singing seamen, so of
course we could not know !
W
It is a pity Noyes does not confine himself
to ballads. Yet here is a little thing worth
preserving:
EVE S APPLE.
When you leant thro’ the leaves with your slow
red smile and your ivory body bare,
Ah, what was the fruit you gathered that day,
white Eve with the dusky hair ?
For we took it and ate it together and laughed !
Your white teeth bit to the core.
There was little to leave for the doves to peck,
when our delicate feast was o’er.^
The ripe fruit breathed of kisses, you said, as your
breast’s white apples may ;
But your body was cold from the coils of the
snake when you came to my arms that day.
There was blood, red blood on our lips, white Eve,
as we nibbled away in the sun ;
But I knew that the fruit was my heart, white
Eve,
The red rent core of my heart, white Eve,
Which we gnawed and left for the rats, white
Eve, when our delicate feast was done.

Coming with a warm recommendation from
no less a critic than George Meredith, we
should expect something from The Collected
Poems of Dora Sigerson Shorter (Hodder and
Stoughton). Mrs. Shorter is indubitably a
balladist. She has the easy swing, the care-
less facility, the pleasant diffuseness of the
story-teller ; and her chief field is that most
fertile one of Irish legend. There is no
space for the quotation of her ballads,
though there are some charming ones upon
Banshees. If this paper had only a Banshee
page we would print them all, with a back-
yard for bunyips, and possibly a jujube ad.
from a professional taniwha. But, excluding
her Banshees, we may sample Mrs. Shorter
by this poem on “ A Meadow Tragedy ” :
Here’s a meadow full of sunshine,
Ripe grasses lush and high ;
There’s a reaper on the roadway,
And a lark hangs in the sky.
There’s a nest of love enclosing
Three little beaks that cry ;
The reaper’s in the meadow,
And a lark hangs in the sky.
Here’s a mead all full of summer
And tragedy goes by.
With a knife amongst the grasses,
And a song up in the sky.
And this simplicity of feeling is found
throughout all her poems. And she, though
feminine, has also the tragic note :
So for the luxury of the flesh, wrap it in fur of fox
that it be warm,
In the bear’s eoat sheltering its nakedness from
storm.
Give wine for its hot veins, fame for its throne,
and laughter for its lips,
All ends in one eclipse,
Sunshine or snows.
We gain a grave, and afterwards —God knows.
\l/
Much more distinctive work are the New
Poems of Herbert Trench (Methuen).
Trench has thought, modernity and the
poet’s mind. His Apollo and the Seaman
is a work of imagination second in its kind
only to Coleridge’s aged and loquacious sailor-
man. And Trench has forced the compari-
son by printing stage directions in the mar-
gin of his poem. It begins, stimulatingly,
thus :
Apollo through the woods came down
Furred like a merchant fine,
And sate with a Sailor at an Inn
Sharing a jug of wine. . . .
“ And why are you cast down, sailor
And why are you cast down ?
With lapfuls of the guineas light
Came you not back to town ?” . . .
The sailor tells him his dreadful news •
“ I heard them calling in the streets
That the ship I serve upon—
The great ship Immortality—
Was gone down like the sun.” ...
“ What was her build, that boat of yours,
So proud upon the sea ?
What was her make of hull and deck,
What suit of sails had she ? ”
“ O, her stretch of sail so white, so white,
By no man’s hand unfurled,
Was Heaven ! ”
“ And the decks you kept so bright ? ”
“ Were like this bustling world.”
“ And the hold and cockpit out of sight,
Pitch dark and ill to smell,
Full of the friends of your delight ? ”
“ That was the pit of Hell !
“ How think of her, gone down, gone down !
How think of her decayed !
Or that the maker of that ship
Could let his creature fade ! ”
\»/
Apollo explains that the ship was wrecked
by the
Mutiny of those friends of yours,
In irons down below... .
Blindly they stretched their scarry hands,
Their piteous hands, to me :
“ Since birds we cannot hear, nor sight,
Be thou our sanctuary !
Open again the narrow gate—
Let us no longer be ! ” . . .
And remembering then their mad outburst
Of quaint hope and despair
Who deemed each puny life should last
When nothing else escapes.
And the nations and the planets melt
Like breakers on the capes,
From laughter, from tears unquenchable,
Scarce able to forbear,
I smote the great hull to a ghost
And the mighty masts to air. ...
So the last great ship of man is lost:
Derelict—drifting out of hail—
Lost Immortality.
But Apollo has a new ship ready for us.
Earth is the ship ! Thou shalt have time
To find the Earth thy friend ! . . .
How like an eagle on the abyss,
With outspread wings serene,
She circles [—thought rolls under her
And the flash from the unseen.
Here’s to her mission, winged rock,
Bluff-bowed and heavy keel’d,
Through the night-watches swinging on
Still under orders sealed !
No crystal gives a peep, my son,
Of her errand far and surgy ; . . .
Nor, for the future, shall you reap
Much benefit of clergy.
Yet the seaman is not satisfied.
I am a man and not a race.
What matters, if self ends ?
And Apollo confesses his own impotence, his
kinship with his creature :
I too, like thee, have striven.
I too am launched from the profound
And past; I too am driven
In turn upon the stream of storms
From fountains beyond Heaven ;
And to me, too, light is mystery
And the greater life half-given.
And at the last the seaman is reconciled by
the sight of his sou playing with paper ships
by the gutter.
And whether it were ship or no,
The Earth seemed good to him....
Buffeting on from age to age,
It still was under way.
A great poem. The Voice from the Column
finely pictures Nelson warning the English—
So are the nations changed
Since the day of Trafalgar !
What we have been, they are.
And (beat low, muffled drum !)
What they were, we have become !
Indeed, the book has much worthy work.
The Stanzas to Tolstoy are packed with
thought, fiery with the glow of imagination.
And his Daughters of Joy treats a very old
theme in a very modern way. For a final
stanza let us close with this :
In summer-time when Mary bathes
And floats along as in a sky,
G might I be the stream that swathes
Her beauty with infinity!
Herbert Trench is one of the most hopeful
portents in present-day England. His work,
rough-liewn and crude in construction, is, like
Meredith’s, clogged with thought. In every
poem he has something to say, not some-
thing, as with Stephen Phillips, to describe.
He is forty-three years of age, and so far has
apparently produced only one other book of
verse and a translation of Merejkowsky’s
Death of the Gods.
The Moke
The Origin and Influence of the Thorough-
bred Horse, by Win. Ridgeway, is a brave
attempt to solve the problem of the origin of
the moke. And Australia, with its worship
of nag, ought to be interested. The author's
researches clearly establish the fact that the
horse, though indigenous in Upper Asia, was
not a native of Arabia. “ The reader will
probably be startled by this last statement,
inasmuch as it has hitherto been generally
held that Arabia is the original, and not
merely the adoptive, mother of the famous
steedsthat bear tiername.” But the testimony
of the great geographers Eratosthenes and
Strabo would of itself be sufficient to put it
beyond all doubt that the Arabs did not
breed, or even possess, horses until after the
beginning of the Christian era. Strabo says
of Arabia : “It is inhabited by Arab tent-
dwellers, who breed camels. With the
exception of horses, mules and swine, there
are numerous herds of cattle, and there are
all sorts of birds except geese and domestic
fowl. ” Speaking of the most fruitful portion
—that inhabited by the Nabataeans —he
says : “It produced sheep with white wool,
and oxen of a large size ” ; but adds emphati-
cally that the “ land does not produce horses,
whose place is served by camels.” The
Nabataeans were the Arabs who occupied
the ancient Edom, or Idumea, the region
lying between Syria and South Arabia. This
documentary evidence is fully confirmed by
the monumental. “ For when ASmilus
Seaurus, in B.C. 60, received the submis-
sion of the Nabataean King Aretas, he issued
coins bearing; on the reverse an Arab leading
his one-humped camel. The Arabian King
is thus portrayed, not as a cavalier,, but as
a camel rider.” Ridgeway also points out :
“ the evidence of the Semites themselves, set
forth in the Old Testament, puts it beyond
doubt that neither the tribes of Arabia
Proper nor those of Mesopotamia possessed
horses until a comparatively late period.
Even Job himself did not own a single horse.”
But he must have seen one, for God re-
marked to him that “ the glory of his nostrils
is terrible,” and also observed that the horse
“ saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha ! ” Cab-
horses nowadays have forgotten how to laugh.
Arab tradition also bears out the contention
that the original Arabian thoroughbred was
a camel. It was subsequent to the birth of
Christ that the Arab discarded his single-
humped camel and bestrode and bred the
moke.

The Maoriland volume of Newnes’ series
of “ Nations at Home ” has been entrusted
to a well-known Wellington journalist, R.
A. Loughnan. New Zealand at Home is a
chatty and discursive description of the
Dominion where the earthquakes come
from. To a stranger the book will doubtless
prove useful; but it cannot be compared
with W. Pember Reeves’ masterly Long
White Cloud. It is a pity that the author
had no opportunity of correcting his proofs,
for the Maori names under the illustrations
are in some cases mangled beyond recog-
nition.

“ My little daughter, aged 2,
had to undergo a very seri-
ous operation, which left
her weak and ill. The re-
sults of SCOTT’S Emul-
sion were beyond my ex-
pectations, for my daughter
is now strong and well, and
owes her good
ĥ
and strength to SCOTT’S Emul-
sion, which I found to be a
combined food and medicine.”
(Mrs.) Avis Derrick.
Victoria Estate, Ingham, Herbert River,
N. Queensland. 6/6/07.
ABOVE IS THE PROOF IN THE FACTS.
HERE IS PROOF IN THE REASON WHY :
SCOTT’S Emulsion easily demonstrates
its superiority over all competitive emul-
sions when put to the test of actual trial.
The test is in the cure—the hard work is
in the laboratory. The materials selec-
ted are always the very best, and the
SCOTT process is the result of long and
painstaking experiment; it has never
been rivalled. This is why SCOTT’S
has an unchallenged record of cures.
Therefore, when purchasing, don’t ask
for “ Emulsion; ” ask for and get

cure for you!

By the Bree.
And it’s O ! but .her lips were red,
And Ah ! but her flesh was white ;
And I would ’twere I in her stead
At peace by the Bree to-night.
Where I saw them first together
My man and she alone ;
When the river slipped a-feather
By our old-time trysting stone.
“ Greeting ! ” His lips were set
To hers as never to mine ;
His eyes with bliss gleamed wet
As the waters, all a-shine.
For it’s O ! but her blood ran red
Till her face was white to see.
As I turned from the corpse and fled
That night by the lilting Bree.

Nirvana.
Nirvana is not nothingness, no, not at all, to me;
I place it in a summer isle, embraced by azure
sea.
Nor must I follow Buddha’s faith if I would have
a chance
To reach his highest recompense, the Great De-
liverance.
I find that in my snug retreat, where worldly
hustlings cease;
Whose ways are ways of pleasantness, where every
path is peace,
A drowsy, bowered hermitage, whose vistas never
tire;
A realm of Lotopliagi, the Land of Heart’s De-
sire.
The South Sea sings its cradle-song my Shore of
Sleep around,
And warm winds, droning dreamily, this chorus
seem to sound :
“There’s nothing half so sweet in life, in sooth,
as our caress;
It’s perfume brings oblivion’s serene forgetfulness.
Come, rest you, all you weary ones ! oh, slumber,
all you sad !
So shall you quit disquietude, and, waiting, shall
be glad.”
For it is fixed that he who gains the gift of
Nature’s kiss
Knows everlasting peacefulness, and peacefulness
is bliss.
And bliss is but Nirvana, briefly put, in English
phrase,
So I may find my Paradise before I eh'd my days.
I need not chance Elysium, my Paradise is where
The surf foams white on coral walls that fence a
garden fair
And fruitful as that floral dream which Milton’s
stanzas limn.
Where Man the First knew happiness ere Woman
came to him.
Its spell attends a some-day’s glad translation to
bestow
Appeasement on a yearning soul that loved it
long ago.
And, though its charted name and site I don’t
precisely state,
Lest others rush my- Eden-nook until its charms
abate,
There is no ringed monopoly in rare and radiant
goals,
Though seeing eyes must seek for them, and men
are mostly moles;
For somewhere sure waits Paradise on earth for
every man,
If only he can win to it; ah, if he only can !
Nirvana is not nothingness, nor need one die to
find
The best of all beatitudes, tranquillity of mind.

The Temple and the Shape.
They carved it out of marble
When the world was in its youth ;
They painted it with golden dyes,
And named the Shape “ A Truth.”
They stood it in a temple—
A wide and spacious hall—
A sweet and gracious work of art
Upon a pedestal.
The rolling ages knew it,
They felt its wizard charm ;
And men and maidens sought its aid
In hours of soul-alarm.
It held the bondman patient,
It dried the eyes of Grief;
It promised out beyond the grave
Reward and rich relief.
A thousand preachers praised it,
A thousand poets sang ;
And through the night, and through the day,
Its name imperial rang.
From land to land it governed,
From cape to sullen cape ;
’Twas like to God in God’s own home —
The Temple and the Shape.
Yet came the Sons of Knowledge,
The searchers keen and pale,
Who break the rocks, and weigh the stars.
And rend the hiding veil.
They entered at the Temple,
With eager heart and eye,
And there about the statue’s base
They read its name—“ A Lie.”
And when the Shape lay tumbled
From its high pedestal,
The earth still ran an even course,
Nor did the heavens fall.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (■with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “'The Editor. Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
ojiicials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

STATE ENTERPRISE OR CHAOS.
The N.S.W. Farmers’ and Settlers’ Association
lately sat in anxious conference in Sydney, and it
said a good many things about the beauties of
Private Enterprise, even while passing several
dozen resolutions in which it clamored wildly for
State or Public Enterprise to come to its assist-
ance and giveit a hand. One of the great difficulties
of the period is the difficulty of holding back
Private Enterprise by the coat tail as it sprints
multitudinously up the Ministerial stairs to ask
the State to interfere, and most times the coat-
tail slips, and Private Enterprise gets away, and
docs ask the State to interfere. It is largely
by reason of the incessant shout of Private
Enterprise for State Interference that State
Enterprise is spreading so rapidly, and
the people who complain about its expan-
sion are merely barking against the inevitable.
The State has been constructing things ever since
there was a State. The State has been interfering
ever since there was a State. The beginnings of
State Construction were also the beginnings of
civilisation, and presumably the end of State Con-
struction will be the end of civilisation. And,
as a general thing, the country which has most
State Enterprise is also the most civilised coun-
try. It is a little late in the day for a Farmers’
arid Settlers’ Association to shout against Collect-
ivism, which is State Enterprise, which in its turn
is the’whole embodiment of human progress.
In very early days the State—what there vyas of
it then —seems to have had a faitly m I iivate
Enterprise which was almost pathetic. It was
probably the need for roads which first set
State Enterprise going. Private Enterprise
either wouldn’t make roads at all or else one
bit of Private Enterprise wouldn’t take the
trouble to see that its fragment of road
joined on to the fragment that was built by the
next bit of Private Enterprise. In fact, in very
early and individualistic days one Private Enter-
prise couldn’t safely go to see another about a
road or anything else without great danger of
being killed. In Scotland, until a comparatively
recent date, the State authority was amazingly
weak, and Private Enterprise was supreme.
Consequently it isn’t much more than 100 years
since Scotland had roads at all. And when the
roads were made, Private Enterprise didn’t even
know which side of the track to walk on till Public
Interference told it to keep to the right. In the
olden, golden times of Private Enterprise war was
conducted by anybody who could buy the neces-
sary weapons and find the necessary followers,
and he took who had the chance, and he kept who
had the luck and the opportunity. War was pure
individualism, and every man was his own soldier
and his own policeman and his own pirate ; and
it wasn’t till State Interference made military
and naval and police matters a Government
monopoly that a farmer and settler could call
his wife or his cow or himself his own,
or could put his head out after dark—or even
before dark—without imminent risk that there
might fall upon it a club, wielded by parties who
are still at large. Genuine Private Enterprise
lingered long in Australia under the name of bush-
ranging (the bushranger didn’t ask the State for a
subsidy, so he was the genuine article—almost the
only genuine article) ; and it did many things it
shouldn’t have been allowed to do—notably it
laid out a good deal of early Sydney, which, for
lack of early and vigorous State Interference,
requires reconstruction worse than any other city
in the continent. It is amazing how little Private
Enterprise knew when left to itself. It didn’t
even know that it was unhealthy to throw out the
slops in front of the door, to have no drains and
no regular water supply, and to sleep ten people
and sundry pigs in a room. State Interference
washed and drained and scrubbed Private Enter-
prise, and taught it not to marry two wives, and
generally set it on the way it should go.
*•**■*
In early times weights, measures and money
were, to a great extent, left to Private Enter-
prise, and that article was as incapable and
incoherent as usual. The Tory press of to-day is
greatly addicted to recommending “the influence
of public opinion ”in preference to Parliamentary
Interference, but the force of public opinion
couldn’t even prevent the yard being about
in one part of England and nearly sft. in another,
and all manner of other lengths in between, till a
strong tyrant interfered and fixed it at ofiin.,
where it stdl remains. In the matter of weights
and measures, unfortunately, the State in Eng-
land didn’t interfere in time nor with proper
ferocity, and Private Enterprise and public
opinion wallowed along in their usual dismasted
way. As a consequence, instead of having only
one measure each of length, weight, area
and cubic capacity, there are in England
the legal stone, the customary stone, the
fodder (which is one weight at London
and another at Newcastle), the long ton
and the short ton, the clove, tod, wey,
pack, last, aum, pottle, strike, coomb, the perch
(of 30£ yards), the hide, the Lancashire acre,
Cheshire acre, and Heaven knows how many
dozens besides in the way of outlandish and com-
plicated and little-known measurements. The
English language, too, was left to Private Enter-
prise, with the awful result that there are five
vowels to represent nearly 20 vowel sounds, and
there are about 10 missing consonants (that is to
say, there are consonant sounds in the language
that are not in the alphabet), and the pronuncia-
tion has gone so utterly to the dogs of chaos that
no one can tell by the spelling of a word how it
sounds—in fact, if a man lived to a good old age,
and did nothing all his life save study the Eng-
lish language, the chances are that he would mis-
pronounce the name of his medicine while on
his death-bed, and mix up an irregular verb
in his last moments. But State Interference at
least saved the calendar from destruction. It
found Christmas getting further on into January
every year, and the State ran after Christmas,
and brought it back, and nailed it down, and tied
it up, so it, at all events, has been rescued from
the confused and unfixed habit of mind to which
Private Enterprise is so much addicted.
* * * ■*
It was long before decent roads were supplied
that the need for some kind of postal communica-
tion began to be felt. Private Enterprise never
got very far beyond writing the letter (if it could
write ; mostly it could only make its cross) and
giving it to a crusader to put in his helmet for
delivery at some unspecified time, or sending a
partially-naked person to run on foot, holding the
document in a cleft stick. The State interfered,
and created the post office, the money order
system, and the savings bank; also in most
countries it runs the telegraphs, and in many it
conducts the telephones. It regulated banking,
which had become a very chaotic institution, and
in some, cases it runs banks itself. When speedy
means of communication were wanted it either
built railways itself or explained to Private Enter-
prise how to do it; in England it took
over 40 Acts of Parliament to fully ex-
plain to Private Enterprise how to do
it. And in about nine countries out of ten
where the building and management of railways
was left to Private Enterprise—after State Inter-
ference had explained how to do it—the State
gave Private Enterprise, either in money or land,
a great part of the means of doing it. Once or
twice, however, the State didn’t explain—or
wasn’t strong enough to explain adequately—to
Private Enterprise how to do it; a notable case
was in early Colorado (TJ.S.A.) where the Denver
and Rio Cfrande Railway Co. and the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe concern tore up each other’s
lines, hired small armies, fought battles, and fired
cannon at each other’s railway stations. Then
when harbors were wanted the State supplied
them ; and when canals were needed it mostly
supplied them also ; even such a mouldy thing as
the Egyptian State made the Suez Canal
possible and did the bulk of the hard work,
and State Interference is now creating the
Panama Canal and shovelling away the bones
that Private Enterprise has left in the way.
And when Private Enterprise, having been
supplied with harbors and canals, didn’t know
how deeply it was safe to load the vessels that
used them, the State invented a Plimsoll mark
for its enlightenment. It even had to pick the
weevils out of the sailor-man’s biscuit, and per-
sonally smell his salt junk to see if it was good,
because Private Enterprise was unfit for either
job. And, after leaving education to Private
Enterprise for hundreds and hundreds of years,
the State, in disgust, took charge, and started to
explain personally to the rising generation the
difference between B and a bull’s foot—a point on
which its ignorance, up to then, had been dis-
graceful as well as incredible.
The highways and byways of State Enterprise
are truly innumerable. It created English manu-
factures and shipping by a multiplicity of laws
which are mostly forgotten now, but which
did good service in their time. These laws, in an
amazingly few years, raised England from being an
aboriginal or King Billy kind of land which ex-
ported wool and bought manufactured goods from
Flanders, and which had its commerce conducted
by Flemings, and its banking by Italians, and
called its money “easterling” because even that
came from Germany, to the position of a State
which made things for itself, and looked all
the industrial world in the eye unafraid.
State Interference created the English horse;
that degenerate animal, left for many years
to Private Enterprise, was fast becoming
a sort of terrier, when the State ordered a
slaughter of undersized and diseased stallions and
useless brood mares, and imported improved stock,
and brutally curtailed the liberty of the subject
in the matter of breeding from inferior animals.
It taught the builder how to construct houses that
wouldn’t fall down ; every up-to-date community
lias Building Acts to prevent the sky-scraper
constructed by that notorious artist called
Jerky from falling headlong into the
street. It has built almost everything in
the world that is or has been conspicuously worth
looking at among the doings of man —the Pyra-
mids, the Pantheon, the Taj Mahal, the Kutab
Minar, Solomon’s Temple, the Tomb of Humayan,
the Parthenon, St. Peter’s, the hanging gardens
of Babylon, the pharos of P. Philaoelphus, St.
Mark’s, and other works innumerable. In between
times the State nurses the abandoned infant, cleans
pavements, runs fire, life and accident insurance the
more cheaply than Private Enterprise knows
how, carries you two miles in a tram car for a
penny, and takes care of the lunatic. Private
Enterprise used simply to let the village idiot
roam the streets and gibber at people, or else it
kept him in a wooden cage opening off the street,
as if he were a “ pretty cocky.” The State drags
the Private Enterprise churches apart by the
tail when they want to fix their teeth in
each other’s ear. And in its spare time,
and in different places, it acts as trustee and
executor, makes tobacco and cigars, manufac-
tures opium, boils sugar, hammers iron, drives
coaches, makes bread, makes and sells liquor,
sells cheap coal, conducts ferries, restores the
apparently drowned, makes clothes, runs after and
kills rabbits, supplies the lazy and incompetent
Private Enterprise person with water for irriga-
tion, rescues his partially-ruined banks from
destruction, lends him money for deep sinking in
mines, lends him money at a low rate on his farm,
lends him the State bull for breeding purposes,
and does other beneficent acts which Private
Enterprise seems unequal to in its own bloated
and arrogant and individual capacity. It even
carries Farmers and Settlers and their families to
Conference at half rates, they being too mean to
pay full rates, low as these are.
State Enterprise and State Interference, in
short, comprise the whole history of civilisation,
and the alleged Private Enterprise person who
objects to them is simply a person who objects to
civilisation. He is an Anarchist. When the
silly Farmers’ and Settlers’ Association de-
clares itself a staunch believer in Indi-
vidualism as against the Collectivist ideas of
the Labor party, it really proposes to undo civili-
sation —to get back to the time when a man (if he
could write, which was seldom) communicated
with another by sending his serf to run over bogs
and through forests with the letter stuck in a cleft
stick or hidden in his waist rag. Of course, the
Farmers and Settlers don’t really mean that—
they only think they do. What they would
probably say if they knew better how to express
themselves is that the existing State Socialism
and State Enterprise and State Interference
should be maintained, but that the peg should
be put in right here, and that State Enterprise
should spread no further. And after they had
said that they would most likely find that they
didn’t exactly mean it either. Yet it expresses the
idea of the present day self-styled individualist
about as well as anythingcando. Unfortunately for
the alleged individualist the peg won’t stay in after
it is put in. It gets washed out. Things in this
world won’t remain stationary ; even the Chinese
intellect moves. If they don’t progress they must
retrograde, and when State Enterprise begins to
retrograde it means that the country starts on
the back track towards the old condition of things
in which there were no roads, no railways, no
drains, no telegraphs, and each man was his
own army and navy and policeman. Every-
thing that makes civilisation began with State
Enterprise. The State either did things or made it
possible for private people to do them. The
beginning of things was chaos and disorder;
the progress of things was the growth of
the community principle, which made order
possible; and as the community principle must
either grow or decay, the end of things will
apparently be either complete State Socialism or
chaos again. If the community idea keeps
growing, the end must be Socialism. If it
begins to decay, the first sign will be that the
Bruce Smith or other individualist of the
moment will walk along the middle of the street
at night in order to avoid sudden attack ; then
presently there will be no street; and soon after
that there will be no Smith. The Farmers and
Settlers may object to Socialism as much as they
please. But as there is no more to be gained by
denouncing it than by speaking in disparagement
of the equator, they would be wiser to leave the
subject alone. Nothing is gained by throwing
clods at the inevitable, audit often happens that
while the farmer is away clodding the inevitable,
the cow at home has got through the fence and
fatally blown herself out on green sorghum.
THE “INTERNATIONAL FREETRADE
CONGRESS.”
In the course of his presidential address, Lord Wklby ad-
mitted that the prospect of Freetrade throughout the
world was somewhat cloudy. Protection was, he said,
advancing in very aggressive fashion, but Freetraders
were confident that the cause which promoted liberty at
home and friendship and peace abroad must ultimately
triumph.
Winston Churchill (President of the Board of Trade)
insisted on the intimate relation between Freetrade
principles and good international relations.
The keynote to all the speeches was the intimate con-
nection between Freetrade and peace.
SUFFRAGETTES EXPELLED.
Suffragettes frequently interrupted the meeting, especi-
ally while Mr. Churchill was speaking. They were ex-
pelled.
LONDON, Wednesday.—-The Manchester Master Cot-
ton-spinners propose to reduce wages five per cent.
A total of about 150,000 operatives will be affected if the
proposals are made effective. —Cctblegr evens front Jjoncion.
Very appropriately, the Congress is sitting in the
citadel of Freetrade.* Indeed, the British fact is in itself
an unanswerable defence of Freetrade. It is the one
great Freetrade European country. “How,” cries the
Protectionist, “ can little England be right and big
Continental Europe wrong?” This is as much as to say
that truth must always be the possession of the majority.
Truth, it inav be frankly conoedec»> must be with the
majority if all the Continental Protectionist countries
are superior in wealth and the conditions of social happi-
ness to Freetrade Great Britain. The logical requirement
of this Protectionist contention is that Great Britain
should be at the bottom of the comparative list. But she
is at the top. Bang goes the contention. England ought
to be ruined, but she is the greatest of empire builders,
holds the supremacy of the sea, and is the leading creditor
nation. . . . The keynote of all the speeches, says our
cable correspondent, was the intimate connection between
Freetrade and peace. —Sydney Telegraph.
* * *
When tlieForeign-trader has nothing better to say,
he generally asks, as the Sydney Telegraph does,
whether Britain, the great example of Freetrade,
is poorer or richer than the Protectionist nations
of continental Europe. It is a foolish query, for
there are two Britains in the ease. One is the
island of England and Scotland, which faced the
new fiscal epoch with its industries so mag-
nificently established, after a long course of
Protection, that it owned nearly one-third of the
world’s manufactures, fully one-third of the
world’s steam-power, about a third of the world’s
wealth, about a quarter of its commerce, and
nearly a third of its shipping. The other case is
that of Ireland, which, after 600 years of war and
oppression, had very few industries indeed.
Britain started out with the Freetrade super-
stition in its hand merely to defend the splendid
position it had already gained, and it
wasn’t driven to do even that in any serious
fashion till within the last 30 odd years, for
France only definitely abandoned the Freetrade
derangement about 1872, and Germany about 1879,
and the United States didn’t take to Protection
in any scientific fashion till the late ’sixties, or
take to it in real earnest till 1890. Till these
dates there was no very serious attempt to challenge
Britain’s supremacy. And even then it naturally
took a long time to materially reduce the stupendous
lead which Bull’s Own Country had gained under
Protection. The worst which has happened
up to date is that Britain has been so far over-
taken by its Protectionist rivals that it now
occupies only third place.as to wealth and manu-
factures ; that its agriculture has perished to such
an extent that it can now only feed itself for
about two months in the year; that quite a
number of its counties are marked on the map as
practically uninhabited while the congestion in
towns is stupendous ; and that it sends out every
year over 300,000 emigrants of its own people,
mostly bound for Protectionist countries. Barring
these matters, and the fact that about a quarter
of the population never has quite enough to
eat, and that the country is already losing its
faith in the Cobden gospel, there is nothing much
wi'ong with Great Britain after about 30 years of
competition, under Freetrade conditions, with two
great Protectionist rivals.
* * * *
But Ireland faced the beginnings of Freetrade
under wholly different conditions. With Ireland
it wasn’t a case of merely defending the strongest
manufacturing, commercial and financial position
the world had ever seen. It was rather a question
of trying to do what fool-advisers like the .Sydney
Telegraph urge Australia to attempt —to build
up new industries and new wealth and new great-
ness on Freetrade principles. Ireland is the true
criterion of the blessings of Freetrade as they
apply to us. It started about 1850 from scratch
or thereabouts in an industrial sense, just as
Germany did about 1879, only the two countries
started with different fiscal policies. The results
are that Ireland has lost half its population, that
a nation has been almost obliterated, and that the
green and fertile isle became, almost from the day
when Freetrade began to be imposed upon it, the
one white man’s country on earth that was unfit for
a white man to live in. And Germany, starting
from almost the same point, became, inside 30
years, Britain’s dangerous rival in almost every
branch of industry. Comparing Ireland and Ger-
many, the dispassionate observer begins to have
grievous doubts about the shoddy gospel.
The off-hand shout of such blind guides asSydney
Telegraph is to the general effect that if
a mere 30 years or so of competition on a
Freetrade-ver,-ms-Protection basis hasn’t utterly
ruined England, therefore Freetrade is proved
beyond all question to be the one. true faith.
The contention is too thin, for great countries
don’t collapse in a day. For very many years—
the years in which Britain’s supremacy over the
nations of continental Europe was built up—
Britain was the great high-tariff country amidst a
multitude of low-tariff rivals. Portugal tried
Freetrade of a kind, and went to the Devil, and
has remained at the Devil ever since. France
tried Freetrade, and the misery that resulted
brought about the great Revolution. It is custo-
mary to ascribe the Revolution to legal oppression
and feudalism, but with all these drawbacks Pro-
tectionist France under Colbert was rich and
contented, and Freetrade France under Turgot
and Necker was so hungry that it could have
almost eaten its king raw after it had beheaded
him. Germany also experimented with low
tariffs, and became a land of beggary. Then
Napoleon I. fell on all these poor, miserable, low-
tariff nations, and about finished their ruin, and
Protectionist Britain emerged from the Napoleonic
war owning almost all the wealth, manufactures
and commerce of Europe. Even the United States
got the low-tariff madness for many years, and
while it was a question of high-tariff England
competing against its low-tariff foreign competi-
tors, England’s supremacy was beyond all ques-
tion. But though the work of many generations
hasn’t been wholly undone in about 30 years, it
doesn’t follow that Freetrade has proved its case.
There are still a good many years to come.
And Britain hasn’t by any means trusted to
Freetrade to keep it afloat. During the Freetrade
period it has annexed by force and high-handed
violence the richest diamond field in the
world, just to give the Cobden policy a lift.
It has seized in the same way the richest
goldfield in the world. It annexed the world’s
ruby supply and a huge proportion of the
world’s oil supply when it took Burmah. It
took d uring theF reetrade period British East Africa
(180,000 square miles). Central Africa (42,200
square miles), Cyprus (3584 square miles), Fiji
(7435 square miles), Lagos (3420 square miles),
Nigeria (over 300,000 square miles), North Borneo
(31,000 square miles), Somaliland (63,000 square
miles), Bechuanaland (275,000 square miles), the
Orange Free State (50,000 square miles), Rhodesia
(144,000 square miles), the Transvaal (117,000
square miles), and Zanzibar (1020 square
miles); also it casually roped in Egypt and
Nubia, and a heap of other places. A country
which was eating up the earth in that fashion
could hardly avoid making some money, for the
time at least. And when nearly one-third of the
human race is not only ruled from but is
mostly compelled to adopt the Freetrade or low
revenue-tariff gospel and keep its ports open to
British goods, Freetrade in England gets an arti-
ficial lease of life which has nothing to do with
its own merits.
Probably the most humorous aspect of the situ-
tion, however, is the assurance that Freetrade and
peace are linked together. Britain had been in a
state of reasonable tranquillity fur many years


before it abandoned Protection—the marine shindy
at Navarino, the first Chinese war, the taking of
Sir Charles McCarthy’s skull to Accra, and
some troubles in India and Afghanistan were
almost the only blots on 40 years of unusual
calm. People were actually talking about
war having come to an end. But in the
Freetrade period things woke up to some
extent. There was a desperate war with Russia,
also an Indian Mutiny, a war with China, and a
war with Persia. A European war, which might
have been as great an affair as the Napoleonic
struggle, was only averted because Britain broke
its solemn treaty and left Denmark to its fate.
There was war with Abyssinia, war with Ashantee,
Afghan war, Zulu war, Soudan war, Egyptian war,
Transvaal war, an invasion of Mexico, a war
with Burmah, a Kaffir war, a war with Thibet,
and many sundries. Quite a number of these
wars arose through the lust for conquest—a lust
that was partly forced upon Britain because,
having thrown its own markets open to every-
body, it took to hunting all over the earth for new
markets outside. In fact, Freetrade Britain has
on its hands, as a general thing, about six wars
for one that the most quarrelsome Protectionist
country can show. And Freetrade Britain is to-
day the world’s awful example in the way of
bloated armaments, for it spends more money on
military and naval preparations than any other
country on earth. It has to do that for a number
of reasons. In its anxiety not to tax imported
goods it has heaped on direct taxation till direct tax-
ation and cheap imports have almost killed its agri-
culture, and being in consequence the only country
that could be starved out by a two months’ block-
ade, it has to maintain a stupendous navy, not
only to protect its own shores, but also to guard
all the sea routes by which its imported food
comes to hand. Then it must needs defend its
Crown colonies, which supply markets for
so . •puuh of its goods. A Protectionist
Britain could insist on the free admission of
British goods to France, Germany, Austria,.
Russia and the United States as the price of the
free admission of the goods of these countries to
British territories. But Britain, being obsessed
by the Freetrade superstition, reckons that that
sort of bargaining is beneath the dignity of the
great Cobden principle. So its alternative is to
go forth and conquer hundreds of thousands of
square miles of country occupied by scores of
millions of niggers, so that it may sell goods to
these niggers. Then to hold all that coun-
try and all the niggers, it requires the
great fleet already mentioned, and as a
result Britain has the biggest bill for armaments
and the largest list of wars going. Theoreti-
cally, Freetrade may be the doctrine of peace,
but in practice it seems to lead to a fair number
of troubles.
* * * *
The period of large and easy conquest—the
period when Britain was acting the part of Alex-
ander the Great (and the Drunk)—seems nearly
over now. There hardly remains a bit of the
globe that can be annexed without fighting a
Great Power to the bitter end, therefore the Great
Burst has apparently seen its best days. The British
Freetrade craze had amazing luck. It started
when England was, through long Protection and
good fortune in war, the greatest and richest
Power on earth. It was immediately followed by
the discovery in British territory—in Maoriland
and Australia—of some of the greatest gold de-
posits the world has ever heard of. It was
followed later on by the discovery, in the
territories of two weak little States lying
just alongside British territory and handy
for annexation, of the boss gold and diamond
fields of the world. Also, it was followed by a
wonderful movement in the way of invention,
which quadrupled, or more than quadrupled, the
manufacturing power of the human race, and a
good share of this invention was of British origin.
Likewise—largely through the gold discoveries;
which set adventure loose again in a way that had
been unknown since Elizabeth’s spacious days—
there came over the British people a large, reck-
less tendency to invasion and annexation
which in a few years ate up about 5
per cent. of the globe, and all that
globe was worth money. Thanks to these ad ven-
titious aids nothing worse has happened to Britain
during some 30 years of competition on Freetrade
principles .against vigorous Protectionist rivals
than that it has dropped from first to third place
in wealth and industrial importance. It
still keeps • the lead in shipping and
finance, so the result might have been worse.
Yet it might have been a great deal better. But
Australia hasn’t enjoyed two or three centuries of
high Protection; and ic isn’t the supreme
manufacturing and financial and commercial
nation of the world; and it doesn’t possess
a population nor an army nor a navy that
would enable it to go out and conquer in a
few years about 5 per cent, of the globe. There-
fore, it can’t afford to follow in England’s
footsteps, and it doesn’t want to follow in the
footsteps of Ireland. Consequently, it isn’t tak-
ing any Freetrade—which seems to be curiously
tangled up with the throwing out of women who
only want a vote, and the habit of cutting down
the wages of 150,000 cotton spinners by Is. in
the £.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
How to Make Great Wealth out of Nothing.
Premier Price came back from England with a
depressing tale in his month. He told the S.A.
Parliament that, so far as he can see, Australia
will never get out of the clutches of the London
Stock Exchange group, which controls “colonial ”
loans, until a Commonwealth Bank is established
in London to deal in Australian stocks. If that
is the case, it seems fairly probable that Australia
will never get out of the hands of the blessed
“group” at all. South Australia now owes
£4,000,000 less in London than it did two or three
years ago, and it fancied that its position on the
London market would thereby be strengthened.
It isn’t. The State has a £3,000,000 loan falling
due, and it proposed to pay off £1,000,000 with its
own money, and to borrow the rest. It had a
vague idea that it had the right to arrange
the new loan anywhere it pleased, and it
proceeded to negotiate with Lloyds’ Bank, a
stupendous concern with nearly £7,000,000 of
capital and reserves, and over twenty million
pounds of uncalled capital. An institution like
that, which is about eight times the size of the
Bank of N.S.W., looked strong enough for any-
thing, but the sharebroking firm of Nivison,
which represents “ the group that controls colonial
loans,” heard of the pending transaction, and on
behalf of the Stock Exchange trades-union or con-
spiracy, it ordered Lloyds’ to drop the business.
Lloyds’ dropped it, and South Australia learned
the dismal fact that, even though the loan asked
for is a mere renewal of an old I 011, and the State
which asks for the money is vastly more solvent
than it has been for a long time, it must
accept the cash thankfully at any old rate
that one or two London firms like to de-
mand, ‘and if these firms get into a huff
over something and won’t accept an abject
apology, the money won’t be forthcoming at all,
and then, unless the coin can be raised in Aus-
tralia, the State must be declared bankrupt.
Premier Price thinks that a Commonwealth Bank
in London would meet the case, but it is difficult
to see that it could do anything where Lloyds’
failed. Australia, in short, has been kicked hard
by the “ group,” and warned that, unless it is
perfectly humble and obedient in the future, it
may be kicked fatally next time. Under these
circumstances it should be worth while for the
Australian Government to think over the possi-
bility of the adoption of the Canadian banking
system as a partial alleviation of the trouble.
Under that system the banks would be required
to hold at least 40 per cent, of their
cash reserves in Federal Government paper
money—in other words, they would be required to
accept Commonwealth paper money to the value of
about £10,000,000 and give gold in exchange. As a
guarantee of the absolute security of this paper
money, the Australian Treasury could hold (say)
£2,000,000 in gold and £8.000,000 in State securi-
ties. In other words, the Treasury could hold 20s.
in the £ of security against its paper issue, and
as the interest on its State securities accumulated,
and was invested in more State securities, the
guarantee would increase—in 12 years there would
be £2.000,000 cash and over £12,000,000 of State
securities to guarantee £10,000,000 of paper,
which would represent 28s. in the £. and in 26
years the guarantee would equal 40s. in
the £. With this fund the Australian
Government could renew, without application
to the London market, all the State loans
which fall due in London during the next
two years, and thereafter it could at least, out of
its revenue from interest, take up a portion of
each State loan that fell due. That would relieve
the immediate pressure, and in the interval thus
gained it might be possible to find some way of
dispensing with the arrogant British stock ex-
change trades-union which assumed such a high-
handed and heavy-booted attitude in its dealings
with S.A. The proposed method is one
whereby great wealth would be made out of
nothing. Forty per cent, of the money
which lies idle and unproductive in the banks
would be replaced by paper secured by assets
worth 20s. in the£, and these assets would steadily
increase. till the paper money would be covered
many times over. The paper would, for local
purposes, be as useful as gold. But if any bank,
through the diminution of its cash reserves, found
that it was holding more than 40 per cent, in Go-
vernment paper, it could obtain coin for the surplus
at the Treasury, so the profit-earning capacity of the
banks wouldn’t be diminished one whit. Yet the
country would acquire, out of nothing, an annual
income at the rate of £280,000 in the first year, and
about £560,000 in the 20th year, and £840,000 in
the 32nd year—in fact, it would create a big sink-
ing fund out of nothing, and start to pay off its
public debt out of nothing. It seems a pity to
fool away such a chance to make a lot of money
out of nothing.
Abdul the Damned.
The recent upheaval in Turkey is another evi-
dence of a fact which has been noted before, that
the best-laid schemes often go amiss. Abdul-
Hamid (Abdul the Damned) had a scheme—dark,
intricate, inscrutable, boiler-plated, riveted,
copper-bottomed, weather-proof, and apparently
infallible. When Abdul-Aziz died violently, and
Murad V. was violently shifted off the premises,
Abdul-Hamid was raised to the throne mainly by
reason of his obvious piety. He was the. mildest
and most prayerful and most humane prince in
Europe or Asia. In his early days, when he was
steering his way amid the dangers of the court of
his uncle, Abdul-Aziz, the Man Who Stayed Out
Late At Night, Hamid never jostled a caterpillar
without apologising. But when he climbed
to the Imperial dignity a change set in.
There was a great reform movement on at
the time, and Hamid temporised by creating
a Parliament. But a remarkable mortality
set in among the conspicuous reform leaders, and
when the inquest on the last of them was finished,
and the jury had reported that the cause of his
death was the act of God, complicated by measles,
the Parliament was adjourned for good, and
Abdul-Hamid became a new man. His predeces-
sors had been rather a short-lived race, and Hamid
didn’t want to be short-lived. It wasn’t his habit.
So he perfected a huge and amazingly successful
but badly-paid spy system. His spy or secret
police force was, reputedly, like the sands of the
seashore for number. Its members, as a rule,
didn’t know each other, though their officers knew
them. The officers in many cases didn’t know
each other, though Hamid knew them. Hamid
was. . alleged to know everybody in a
general way. Id was said that in Hamid’s
empire three men might sometimes conspire
together with impunity, but if they took
in a fourth he was sure to be a palace spy. Then the
three disappeared. The spies were sometimes paid
and sometimes not. When a secret service agent’s
wages were in arrear he usually said nothing ; if
he said anything, the man he said it to might be
another agent, and he might disapper for speaking
evil of his august but slow-paying master. Still
the seeretWvice cost a lot, and partly for that
reason and partly for other reasons the pay of the
army was always in arrear, and even captains and
colonels were poor and shabby. Still the fear that
they might also take the disappearance disease
was strong upon them. One crowd that Hamid
is reputed to have paid regularly, however, was a
bodyguard of Albanians or some such ruffians, and
they were faithful to him for various reasons, one
being the knowledge that if he died they would
probably be wiped out in the subsequent con-
fusion. In Abdul Hamid’s reign there were mas-
sacres, brigandage and all manner of horrors, and
over and over again the Great Powers interfered ;
but Abdul smiled upon them, and negotiated
with them separately, and sowed dissension
among them, and promised everything, and fooled
everybody, and did nothing, arid sent the Powers
& way on an empty stomach. For 32 years the
Sultan lied and schemed in Constantinople, never
daring to go far away from his capital lest the
State machine might break down in his absence.
He did almost everything in the way of govern-
ment himself because he trusted nobody ; and the
result was that lie toiled far longer hours than a
bricklayer; and yet everything was done badly.
So terrified was he of delegating his authority,
that if a fire broke out in Constantinople it was—
or used to be—necessary to send to the palace for
permission to turn out the fire brigade. Hamid
is said to have once sacked a Minister of State
because he went out for half-an-hour’s walk
and didn’t fully report the matter to his
Imperial master next day. The secret police
agent reported it, of course. It was a won-
derful system, but when 10,000 ill-paid,
ill-fed, disgusted soldiers rose up on an
impulse and said “ Damn the Sultan,” and 20,000
more, hearing them, rose up and said “Damn the
Sultan” also, Abdul Hamid struck something
against which his secret service was powerless.
When the first sudden, unanimous “Damn” was
uttered, the shabby, ill-paid, neglected officers
joined the movement, the European army got out
of hand, the Asiatic army refused to fight against
the European army, the mob lynched the chief of
the secret police, and things burst up generally.
So Abdul the Damned hurriedly climbed down,
and Turkey is supposed now to have a Constitu-
tion and a Parliament, and to be a free country,
and quite Europeanised and up to date. Put
people who remember 1878, and the last Parlia-
ment, and the curious mortality among the last
lot of reform leaders, have their doubts.
The Bootblack and the Professor.
Prof. Marshall-Hall lately told the Melbourne
Argus how lie discovered a fine, aesthetic senti-
ment in the soul of a little Cockney bootblack who
insisted on giving to the musician’s boots the
most exquisitely finished Piccadilly polish of
which art and blacking were capable. The Prof,
would have been satisfied with a less faultless pro-
duction ; but the small artist bootblack cared less
for the opinion of his patron than for his own
idealistic cravings after the Beautiful. The
Dignity of Labor, thereupon argues the Prof.,
should stand above considerations of the market
place, display a fine scorn for hours or wages,
Factories Acts, and such like, and be its own
reward. It is a noble creed. In the Greece of
Pericles, the Rome of Michael Angelo, and
the England of Chaucer, everybody, more or less —
butcher and baker and candlestick-maker— was an
artist, a producer of beautiful things. In old
Japan, before the introduction of battleships and
breweries and picture postcards, every artisan was
an artist; he had plenty of time and no
visible wages, and he adorned whatever he
touched. The only interesting things in
Japan-bronze, lacquer, pottery, cloisonne—are
old things produced before the Joss of
Cheapness became the idol of the world.
In those idealistic times everything one touched
or looked on—clothes, carpets, dishes, stained
glass windows, even a Lord Mayor’s banquet (if
there was any Lord Mayor)—was made a thing of
beauty and a joy till it broke. Now, alas ! the
Guilds, historical and utopian, have passed
away, and Ugliness has become supreme.
Marshall-Hall laments that the worker has lost
pride in his craft, and blames the Labor party for
the evil results. And therein he barks up the
wrong tree. The dire result is due, not to the
sweated artisan, but mainly to Fat, of whom the
Prof, is such a fervid admirer. The Working
Man’s College, where many young artisans, after a
hard day’s work, study at night in order to be-
come experts in their various crafts, affords a
good example of the pride still felt by some in
fine workmanship. But what pleasure can a
working man feel in his trade when it has been
debased by Fat, with his insatiable hunger for
profits and dividends ? It is true that Cheapness
has displaced Quality, but Fat is the High Priest
of Cheapness. The worker has to supply the
demands of his employer, or get the thing you
put wheat in. If he objects, as. the Prof, would
have him—“ Say, boss, I want more time over
this job ; it might suit you, but it doesn’t satisfy
my artistic soul”—he would be fired out because
he couldn’t produce sufficient shoddy per hour.
So the Professor is wrong. The humble artisan
who has been robbed of the joy and pride of work
is not to blame. And not altogether is even Fat
to blame. Poor Fat is but the pearl of the com-
mercially diseased oyster. He is the child of the
age—and the Argus. We are all to blame, all
of us who favor things cheap and ugly, and
reckon “ Moses Bringing Down the Tables of the
Law ” better value for the money than the “Bent
Tree” of Corot. Shoddy has made Philistines
of us all. Nevertheless, all honor to the Prof.’s
little artist bootblack, who, being such an artist,
and no lover of shoddy, and with no capitalistic
vices, is probably now, not as the Prof, imagines, a
bloated employer, but a sandwich man, carry-
ing through the Strand a hideous placard, adver-
tising a foolish actor in an impossible play—the
easy descent of the artist soul in this sordid and
commercial age !

Government by Griffith.
That Australian Chief Justice Griffith is a
singularly able lawyer no one of any judgment
presumes to doubt. That on any question of pure
law his opinion is of the first value in the Common-
wealth is again indisputable. Yet, allowing those
premises, there is still need to question whether
Chief Justice Griffith (who, as a politician,
“boxed the compass’’from extreme Radicalism
to extreme Toryism, and seemed to find the
latter the most congenial direction for his thoughts)
is the best of men to lay down the
precedents on those fine questions of Constitutional
law now arising, which are quite as much political
as they are legal in character. In the matter of
the “ New Protection,” as The Bulletin pointed
out a few issues ago, it was possible for an honest
and skilled lawyer of Tory views to decide in quite
a different fashion from an honest and skilled
lawyer democratic views. Mr. Griffith's
views are Tory, so the New Protection was con-
stitutionally banned. In the matter of the
Union label, decided last week, the situation
was repeated, with the modification that it
was just barely possible for a Tory lawyer to give
a color of legality to his political prejudices
against such “Labor legislation.” Mr. Griffith
is such a splendidly skilful lawyer that he was
capable of the task, and the union label legisla-
tion of the Australian Parliament was declared
“ unconstitutional.” Except to the legal mind,
which can lose all track of common-sense in a
maze of subtleties, the decision seems an extra-
ordinary foolishness. The law, as passed, pro-
vided that a trades-union could register a
label as its trade-mark, its sign that
the goods so labelled were made by its
members; and that that label would be
thereupon protected against piracy. There was
no hint that anyone should be forced to use the
label, no prohibition against the Employers’
Federation, which dearly loves a blackleg, also
registering a blackleg label and securing protec-
tion for it. The law simply said that a trades-
union might get legal protection for the innocent
and desirable purpose of letting the public dis-
tinguish the products of its members. (The
British law which won’t allow “Made in Ger-
many ” goods to masquerade as British is on the
same lines, though it goes much further.) Since
the Federal Constitution gives the Australian Par-
liament full power over all trade-marks matters,’
the subject was clearly within its authority. But
Mr. Griffith says no. In giving the Federal
Parliament jurisdiction over trade-marks, the
Australian people did not mean, he maintains, to
really give it that jurisdiction unfettered. They
meant only to give it jurisdiction over such trade-
marks as he would call trade-marks ; and his
definition does hot agree with the dictionary
definition, nor with the British law definition, nor
with the United States law definition (the
State of California has union-label legisla-
tion, directed against the union-breaking tac-
tics of the Tobacco Trust, and this legislation
has never been upset by the Tobacco Trust, which
is not slow in seeking injunctions and prohibitions
of the Federal judiciary when there is a ghost of
a chance of success). The position now is
that the Federal Legislature may pass Acts,
but Mr. Griffith can upset them by
veto, and does so pretty consistently.
There is really no need to bring any other
personality into the matter. True, there are
five High Court Judges. Two of them, Mr.
Isaa.CS and Mr., Higgins —both eminent law-
yers who in politics were democrats—invari-
ably disagree with Mr. Griffith’s vetoes
upon democratic legislation. The other two,
Mr. Barton and Mr. O’Connor, invariably concur
with Mr. Griffith. Everywhere that Mr. Grif-
fith goes they are sure to follow. They seem to
be obsessed by his masterful mind, tio the posi-
tion comes to government of the Common-
wealth by Mr. Griffith. Thk Bulletin never
saw much cause for joy in the government of
Queensland by Mr. Griffith, and it doesn’t
welcome him as the autocrat of Australia.
Mercenaries or Citizen Soldiers.
Colonel Foster, R.E., grows lyric on the theme
of Defence and the Australian soldier, most
Saturdays, in the Sydney Telegraph. But to
Australians, it all appears very much beside the
point. He regards the local warrior as an
extremely useful warrior—for England. Colonel
Foster is a stern foe of the Deakin Government’s
scheme of a citizen army. Such a force would be
no good to England. He holds that the Aus-
tralians of the present generation should not
think of self-defence in their time, but should
devote their military energies to equipping them-
selves to act, should need arise, as Britain’s
mercenaries in foreign parts. All his enthusiasm
is reserved for the possibility of Australia being
able, not merely to “equip and despatch men
willing and able to fight” on Britain’s behalf, but
for the further possibility of their “reaching the
seat of war, so organised as to be complete, with
staff supply and transport services and field
ambulances.” “ If,” he concludes, “the unavoid-
able wastage in War were readily repaired by
reinforcements in men and horses from their own
country, their usefulness to the Imperial army
would be doubled.” And so on. The trouble
about all this is that, though it inspires
Colonel Foster and most other English officers,
it doesn’t inspire the average Australian to any
great extent. The present-day Australian feels
that his* first duty is to his native land; a share
in the job of buttressing Great Britain
comes, in his estimation, a long way after.
The Commonwealth is a big and desir-
able place—so big and so desirable that its
inhabitants feel the defence force Colonel Foster
approves is nowhere near big enough to meet the
exigencies of the situation. With careful train-
ing, the existing troops would make, doubtless,
valuable enough British auxiliaries. But they
aren’t half numerous enough to defend Australia.
It is impossible to convince one sane Common-
wealth resident in a hundred that the tin-can
battleships which constitute Australia’s naval
defence arm are adequate to keep this country in-
violate in time of stress. As a fact, political
and Admiralty heads in the United Kingdom
hardly trouble nowadays to keep up the fiction
that the local squadron is capable of warding off
serious foreign aggression from Australian shores.
The attitude of the Sea Lords is that they can’t
afford to hire their best to the Commonwealth for
its defence (the great modern vessels and guns are
too badly needed in British waters), and that if
Australia wants front-rank fighting machines it
will have to show as much patriotism as the little
South American tates, and build them for
its own protection. Tbe whole trend of the
modern British defence policy, both naval
and military, is to concentrate strength in
and around England. Naval manoeuvres are
based on North Sea schemes in accordance
with that idea. England is reducing its overseas
armies (e.y., in South Africa) because it is coming
to be recognised by the War Office authorities
that Imperial defence ought to begin at home.
Haldane’s Territorial Army, which is earmarked
“ To be used for British Defence only,” is a plain
manifestation of the same trend. Even so Tory a
publication as the Saturday Review admits
(27/0/’O8) the advisability of the “ introduction of
compulsion” into that scheme, and that is the
expressed view of Roberts and the other world-
famous soldiers of the British National Defence
League. In a word, the United Kingdom is doing
as hard as it can most of the things Colonel
Foster warns Australia against. If the possi-
bility of the invasion of the United King-
dom, which is rimmed round by the cream
of the finest navy on earth, is worth guard-
ing against by a citizen force (and critics of
the Deakin scheme have little to say against the
sound judgment in military affairs of men such
as Field-Marshal Roberts, who think that way),
the possibility of the invasion of Australia, which

The Genteel Clerk and his Humble Lot.
Shocked to the marrow by the fact that ‘‘ a
certain person endeavored to get him to join a
Clerks’ Union,” and by the further fact that the
said Clerks’ Union held a meeting recently at the
Trades Hall, Sydney, and had the vulgar audacity
to draw up a living wage schedule, etc., one who
signed himself “ A Clerk” wrote half a column to
the Sydney Telegraph (6/8/’08) in protest. To
that writer the association of his class with organ-
ised labor appears in the light of a contamination.
He is horrified at the discovery that the rising
generation of Australians in the avenue of em-
ployment along which he toils is jettisoning the
old tradition of humble abasement in the presence
of its employer, and of abject reliance on the
latter’s “kindness.” He beseeches clerks not
‘ ‘to get themselves involved with Labor unions, the
Labor party, the Labor Council, and Socialists.”
Reading his screed, one conceives him shuddering
violently while he wrote, at the tragic thought
that employers might come to regard clerks with
contempt, and question their collective right to
the style of “gent,” as a result of this mad and
radical step on the part of some of their number.
He himself, he explains, is well-satisfied with his
lot. He doesn’t mention his age or his qualifica-
tion, but, whatever they are, he gets a whole
£3 10s. a week for them. (He is probably well
over 40, and in the possession of a family.) The
side-advantages of his job are stupendous. A few
of them, as recorded by himself :
(1) i If by any chance I should lose my usual train to Syd"
ney in the morning and am late, I hear no word of com-
plaint, and, of course, I cheerfully endeavor to make up
for my lateness.
(2) I get one hour for lunch, and can, if need be, take a
little more.
(3) Treated by our worthy employers almost as equals.
(4) l always get a cheery recognition from them in the
morning.
(5) I frequently take work home voluntarily, and this,
under the circumstances, I am delighted to do. And
when, as sometimes happens, it is necessary forme to
exert myself more than usual so as to meet the pressing
desires for expedition of the persons who do business with
my employers, I do so cheerfully.
(6) On one occasion I sprained an ankle, and, naturally,
having such exemplary employers, I was anxious to get
back to the office at the earliest possible moment, and re-
turned before my foot was capable of properly doing its
work. When I turned up at the office one of the prin-
cipals saw my limping gait, and very kindly told me to go
home again.
In the first place, this crawlsome citizen—doubt-
less by some well-defined process of cause and
effect—is in a financial position that not one
clerk in twenty may ever hope to attain. The
average clerkly wage is below that of a tram-con-
ductor, and away underneath that of a de-
cent artisan. It takes an educated man of
mature years, ripe experience, and a high
order of intelligence to earn at the clerking
game anything over the pittance the Telegraph
correspondent reaps weekly. The number that
don’t, and under present conditions may never
hope to, get anything like that sum, crowd all
Johnson’s trams and trains early in the morning
and late at night every weekday of the year. A
proportion of them are parasites living inglori-
ously, perforce, on their relatives till the time
comes when they shall earn a screw big enough to
keep body and soul moored together unaided—
and that time is a matter of years in the coming,
often enough. In every case a clerk has to expect
that he will be called on to do “back-work” or
“overtime.” In the warehousing business he is
paid extra for “overtime” (the Factories Act
has brought this Socialistic curse on the Anti-Sosh
clerk); in businesses which don’t come under
the Factories Act, the clerk just does his
overtime as cheerily as he may for nothing,
plus Is. or Is. 6d. “tea” money. The holidays
of the mere or ordinary clerk are few. . The Bul-
letin is acquainted with an ex-clerk who toiled
for seven years in a bicycle concern and scored
never a holiday, barring public ones, during all
that time. That the clerk is worse paid and
worse treated proportionately to his worth than
any other worker in the Commonwealth is a
truism. His congenital snobbishness, his fatuous
hankering to be regarded as a “ gentleman,”
as something of a clay that is different
from the dust of his ancestor who wore
the bowyangs unashamedly, is responsible—
that, and the presence in his midst of calamities
such as the £3 10s.-a-week Telegraph scribe
abovementioned. He pays the price of shabby-
gentility, and lives always on the steep black
edge of Want in return for the privilege of wear-
ing a dark coat and. a small black bag, and being
in a position to talk disparagingly of unions. To
the unelerkly intellect the reward doesn’t seem
worth the price paid for it. And it is refreshing
to note that a big section of the clerkly intellect
in the Commonwealth is beginning to look at
things that way too.
The Party of Snuffle.
The N.S.W. Government, which has intervals of
hard common-sense, last week brought down a
Bill to provide that when vagrants who fall into
the hands of the police are found to suffer from
certain dangerous and easily-communicable
diseases they should be kept in custody until
cured, quite irrespective of the nominal length of
their sentences. It is a merciful proposal, and the
people treated under it would owe a debt of grati-
tude to the State which gave them another chance
of a clean and wholesome life. And it is a wise
proposal, for the danger to the public health from
the dissemination of contagious diseases can hardly
be over-estimated ; according to one knowledgable
doctor of The Bulletin’s acquaintance, quite
half the illness of the community is due to that
singlecause. Yet, merciful and wise as the measure
is, it has raised a protest from the party of Cant
and Snuffle. “Mr. G. E. Ardill, Hon. Secretary
Public Morals Association,” in a long letter to the
press, calls upon “every worker in the cause of
moral reform ” to fight the proposal to the bitter end.
How moral reform is going to be advanced by
allowing sick people to remain sick and to infect
other people with sickness, Mr. Ardill doesn’t
explain. Cant and Snuffle seldom do explain.
But the idea which governs the protest is plain—
that if unfortunates fall ill through what
Mr. Ardill calls “ vice,” but which a more
humane judge would probably define as the
result of the sweating, the cruelty, and the
greed of our modern social system, they should
be allowed to remain ill, and make as many others
ill as possible. The Bulletin hopes that Mr.
Wade will not be frightened from his purpose by
the protests of the Party of Snuffle. Better rather
to extend the measure, and provide that every
poor sufferer from any form of communicable dis-
ease who comes under the knowledge of the police
should be segregated until cured, and that the
State should attend to the cure.

“Briefless” makes a few remarks :
Wade’s Industrial Disputes Act is, according to N.S.W.
Full Court, a young bear with a peck of troubles
before it. In a dispute over the appointment of a Board
in a minor matter affecting the Newcastle collieries, the
coal owners moved the Full Court for a writ of prohibi-
tion or something. Now Wade’s Act distinctly says
(section 52): —
“Any decision of the Industrial Court shall be final,
and shall not be removable to any other Court by certi-
orari or otherwise ; and no award, order, or proceeding of
the Court shall be vitiated by reason only of any infor-
mality or want of form, or be liable to be challenged,
appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question
by any Court of Judicature on any account whatsoever,
and the validity of any decision shall not be challenged
by prohibition or otherwise.”
When the Chief Justice read this section, the horsehair
on his wig curled in amazement. Having dismissed the
appeal of the coal-owners, which, he carefully remarked,
was on a distinct point of law quite apart from Section
52, he made a few remarks about Section 52. It appears
that Governor Rawson assented to Wade’s Act, and the
Legislature in Section 52 has taken away a prerogative
of the Crown. Now the Crown, which is Ned, must con-
sent before his prerogatives are interfered with, and
apparently Rawson’s job doesn’t include the right of
abandoning the prerogatives of the Crown, or filching
any rig-ht Ned has under the Constitution. So the whole of
the Industrial Disputes Act, according to Justices Darley
and Pring, is ultra vires. This opinion is rough on Mr.
Wade’s law, and unpleasant in many ways.

“ Old Soldier ” : Henry Lucy, in a recent letter
to the S. M. Herald, has expressed the terror
with which Germany is regarded by some classes
in Britain. Lucy alludes to someone who seems to
be White, the defender of Ladysmith, in this
fashion :
He takes the gloomiest view of the military position of
the country, more especially with respect to artillery.
He admits that Mr. Haldane’s scheme is excellent in
theory, and, if fully developed, would be effective. Mean-
while, the country is at the mercy of Germany. When
the hour strikes, he says, Germany will pick a quarrel
with France, in five days will be at the gates, of Paris, will
demand the French navy as the price of peace, and with
its own fleets will be more than a match for England.
White must have taken leave of his senses if he
talked like that. In 1870 it took the Germans
two months to get to the gates of Paris, and then
they had another four months’ work before they
could make peace on much cheaper terms than
those suggested. The army opposed to them was
inferior in everything, and the French fortresses
were old. ill-armed and badly provisioned. The
French frontier towards Germany is now pro-
tected by a first line of four immense entrenched
camps, enclosed by strong, permanent, heavily-
armed forts, which would have to be taken
one by one. When, if ever, this first line
is broken through, there are two others behind it
to be forced before “ the gates of Paris,” or rather
the outer line of forts that surround the city, will
be met. Some of these forts are as much as eight
miles from the city, and their circuit averages over
20 miles across. Paris, even according to German
authorities, could now be neither bombarded nor
blockaded. Things are not too good with the
British army or the French navy, but that German
army which is to reach Paris in five days is too
gorgeous a dream.

The other day an officer of the Adelaide Board of
Health bailed up a milk cart that was on its way
to the Destitute Asylum—the hard, repulsive
name which allegedly philanthropic S. Aus.
applies to its home for aged indigents—and,
taking a sample of the liquid, found that it con-
tained over 38 per cent, of added water. That
meant that for every five gallons of milk there was
a trifle over three gallons of water. The Board of
Health looked hard at this shocking attempt
to rob the old people of very nearly half of
almost the only food some of them can
take, and then passed the scandal on to
the City Council’s solicitors. The solici-
tors, having overhauled the matter, reported
that it wouldn’t be any use prosecuting, because
the alleged milk was supplied under con-
tract, and the contract mentioned what penalties
should be collected if the stuff supplied did not
come up to standard. Presumably, since the soli-
citors say so, that is the law ; but if it is the law,
the sooner it isn’t the better. If the Destitute
Asylum bosses, or the bosses of any other lodging-
house, choose to agree with a milk-purveying
shark that he shall pay 2d. fine if he supplies
three parts water and five parts milk, there seems
no good reason why the law should look at the
2d., and say “That settles it,” and crawl
back to its hole. If two men fight, having pre-
viously agreed that whoever kills the other one shall
pay the widow 4d. and call the thing square, the
law isn’t in the habit of crawling helplessly into
its kennel in the event of the 4d. falling due.
And the milk case is exactly the same sort of case,
only the murder is a bit more gradual and a lot
more contemptible.

Charles Ross, who slipped over at Bacchus
Marsh (Vic.) a day or two ago, deserves a line.
He was an engineer, and (so the record goes) drove
the first rotary engine on a steamboat on the
Clyde, Scotland, more than a half-a-century back.
In ? 52 became to Victoria, and took a leading
part in the construction of the Moorabool and
Melton viaducts on the Tait railways to Geelong
and Ballarat respectively. After that he doesn’t
appear to have done anything remarkable, so this
par will have to switch on to his mother, who was
alleged to have perished at the advanced age of
1052 years. She had the further distinction
of being the daughter of the carpenter who made
Nelson’s coffin. Considering the radiance of that
last assertion, the statement that Charles Ross
was 84 when the inevitable grasped him seems
hardly worth mentioning.

“The Truth,” Clyde Fitch’s comedy,
which was staged at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, last
Saturday night, is right up-to-date in the matter
of form. There is an absence of the dreary, old
potted epigram, and a naturalness of situation and
dialogue about it that charm us moderns, sur-
feited with the artificial stage-conventions of the
’eighties and early ’nineties. Still more charac-
teristic of our latitudinarian times is the kindly
tolerance of the playwright’s attitude towards
life. When Daudet’s “LaMenteuse” was done
into English, the lying Margot had to be made a
very unpleasant person indeed. Her allurements
were purely physical. She had told untruths to
her good, kind husband, and, finally, had been
unfaithful to him. In the end, Margot slew her-
self, and every right-thinking theatre-goer of
the mid-and-latter-
Victorian period
said “ Serve
her right.”
Clyde
Fitch
changes
all that.
He
shows a
woman,
young,

a man who

The husband
is well-off, res-
pected, and the
possessor of many

wife is not tired
of her paragon.
On the contrary,
she loves him as
much as she is
capable of loving
anyone. Yet she
lies to him—wan-
tonly and otherwise
—without stint, and compromises herself with
the husband of one of their mutual friends.
There is really no excuse for her. A Therese
de Megee condones her offences because she
loves with wild passion. But Becky Warder
is of the great army of superficial women; she
has no passion in her composition. It is a
notable tribute to Clyde Fitch or to Margaret
Anglin, or to our own understanding charitable-
ness, that we come away from “The Truth”
well satisfied that no less than justice has been
done when Becky, after a few hours’ worry, the
fruit of her manifold naughtiness, is wrapped in
her husband’s forgiving arms, and thereafter led
back to the comfortable home in which we first
met her.

The gist of it is

is interesting as
a psychological
study of a type
we have most of us

full of affection’s little

of irre-

the part is the clear

fection. Others may
rely for their effects

do with superb assurance and ease. In a role charged
with emotion audiences get carried out of them-
selves very often (where the player has genius),
and aren’t able to watch the machinery working.
In “The Truth,” the onlooker may observe the
portrayerof Becky, the unsympathetic, with a more
or less coldly analytical eye. She uses no gesture
or intonation that hasn’t been brought to the pitch
of absolute justness by hours of thought on the
part of one with an intimate knowledge of
Beckies.
* * * *
Henry Kolker does good work as Warder,
the distracted husband. It is hard to conceive
anything more sincere and convincing than his
handling of the scene where he convicts Becky of
duplicity. The part of Roland —Becky’s deplor-
able father—is a fine one for Titheradge, and that
sound actor takes his opportunity with both
hands. He makes the raffish, mendacious old
villain live before our eyes in all his unpleasant-
ness, and yet in some intangible way we are given
to understand that Roland isn’t such a hopelessly
bad sort as not to merit some of the affection
Becky accords him. It is a notable performance.
Susie Vaughan plays Mrs. Crespigny, a boarding-
housekeeper, excellently, and Miss Alma
Vaughan is good as the jealous wife.

“Endorsing” was the chorus of the
Kilties’ Band welcome when it reached
Sydney by the Marama on Monday. Mr.
G. H. Reid made a speech at them, over
them, and about them at the Town Hall,
and Mr. O’Sullivan endorsed all he had said
about the hardy Scotch character and the
musicianly nature of Sandy Macbagpipe and the
constancy of his passion for Mrs. Bagpipes. He was
proud to welcome such a fine squad of musicians,
and was glad the two giant drum-majors
weren’t Cliffs, and that he hadn’t to scale them, or
words to that effect. Mr. ,J. S. Larke, Canadian
Commissioner, was the next endorsee. He en-
dorsed all the able and flattering remarks of the
last speaker, and gave this country a good
character for kindness to long-haired Russian
pianists and short-kilted landsmen. Conductor
Allen Cook, in reply, was only checked by a
mountainous quantity of modesty from endorsing
everything everyone had said. In the evening
the Highland Society threw up its bonnet in
welcome. Mr. F. Shipman announces the first
concert for August 15 at the Town Hall.

That the drawing power of Marcus Clarke’s
“For the Term of His Natural Life” is still
mighty was demonstrated by the fact that Mac-
Mahon and Carrol had to turn good hard cash
away in heaps from the doors of the Queen’s Hall,
Sydney, where they are rendering that story by
means of the cinematograph. The story has
been, of course, severely edited, but the boiling-
down was evidently done by a man who knew his
business, for the continuity of the yarn is quite
unbroken. The pictures are good, especially the
seascapes, such as the burning of the Hydaspes, and
the voyage of Rufus Dawes, Lieutenant Freer and
Sylvia in the fearful and wonderful boat made by
Dawes. The films are all excellently done, and
have the added attraction of being wholly of Aus-
tralian origin. They prove that as moving
picture builders Australians are not eclipsed by
the best French and Yankee filmers. It is a
stirring show. The only fault the writer has to
find with it is the interpolation of an illustrated
song in the gaps. The illustrated song is out of
date, and should be dropped overboard.

In the complete absence of any news to
the contrary, it is assumed that “Miss Hook of

great United States Drunk is over and the Fleet
has passed away. There is no need for bait in this
cash. The ungarnished Hook is sufficient attrac-
tion.

At Sydney Palace, West’s Pictures com-

Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, sees the most
realistic ghost that ever urged a devoted son to
hear a tale of horror. The “properties” in the
cinematograph rendering of the play are on a
scale of splendor that would have made Sarda-
napalus green with envy, if that worthy monarch
had any envy in his composition. “The Silver
King ” is also shown, and the crowd rises up
and demands encores with wild shouts. That is
another advantage of the moving picture. There
are no encores. The film, having filmed, goes not

Spencer’s Theatrescope, at Sydney Lyceum,
continues to supply instruction and other sub-
stances. A humorous film is the Duel with
Dynamite. On a Parisian boulevarde an ex-
quisitely tailor-costumed young woman is led to
an open-air cafe by her admirer. He goes
within, presumably to order the drinks, and a
perky young Parisian in a fearsome check suit
fixes his monocle on the fair lady. He ogles. She
takes no notice. He seizes a chair and progresses
towards her by a series of frog-like leaps, taking
his chair with him. He tries to introduce him-
self, but is repulsed. Then the stalwart cavalier
emerges, and there is much ruffling of feathers,
which finishes with an interchange of cards.
Next morning one party arrives at the killing
ground in a motor-car, the other in a carriage.
Rapiers are handed out, but no damage is done.
Broadswords are next tried, and each man gets
nicked in the neck, but honor is unsatisfied.
Pistols are used, but nobody is killed.
Then the onlookers, weary of the business, fit a
motor-car petrol tank on each man’s back, fill it
with high explosives, and hand each man a torch,
After that they depart hurriedly while the duel-
ists chase one another, each striving to light the
fuse that sticks out from the other man’s back.
Both get alight, and soar sky ward in pieces with

down just in front of the motor car and carriage,
and shake hands, and all is peace.

Since Austin Rudd last sang at Sydney

Doubt is crowded out. So this scribe reluctantly
concludes that the seven years have really been
devoured by the locust and that he is growing

last he handed out his imported brand of humor,

former brilliancy. The Miles Stavordale banjo
and harp magicians and Mignonette Kokin

The Herbert Flemming co., supported
not so well as it deserved by the public (for
which Flemming lectured the public with pained
surprise when farewelling), has finished its season
at Adelaide Royal, with successive performances
of “The Morals of Marcus,” “Simple Simon,”
and “Dr. Wake’s Patient.” As a play, “Marcus”
easily eclipses the other two. It even preserves
much of the literary charm of the novel. It is
superbly played by Miss Beatrice Day, Miss
Guildford-Quin, and Homewood. This co. is
very strong. Three different men have played the
lead, and there are about three more who are fully
capable of it. “ Mrs. Wiggs ” has now moved in.
The players prove to be better-looking than
the singularly unattractive posters make them
out. The play is richer in “characters”
than in plot; but observation of human
nature is oddly mixed with sheer carica-
ture. The Tivoli, with good juggling and acro-
batic turns, has introduced some needed variety
into its Variety programme, and West’s pictures
at the Town Hall have been showing the Svdney
tramway trouble and other comic and "tragic
happenings.
* * * *
“Simple Simon,” by Murray Carson and
Nora Keith, making its first Australian appear-
ance at Adelaide Royal, proves to be one of the
thinnest play-fabrics imported for a long time.
It must have been the name-part, the character
of the strong, quiet man, that commended it to
Flemming. But the authors (who write like
clever amateurs) have not been able to show the
strength they intend. Simon is readily deceived
by a girl, he deliberately leaves no address while
away on a three-months’ honeymoon, and when
his gigantic business goes to smash as a result, he
only saves himself by a loan from the Jews at the
last moment. In fact, the save is effected between
the eleventh and twelfth strokes of noon ; half-a-
second later, and the chance would be gone.
Simon’s one strong act is his decision—on finding
that the girl who is engaged to him has told a
very natural fib about never having been
engaged before—to still marry her, to enjoy the
long honeymoon aforesaid, and then to blast her
young life by calling her a liar and leaving her.
The idea is as stagey as the long soliloquy in
which it is announced. The whole play needs a
resolute critic with a large, blue pencil (or a large,
blue axe), there being quite 50 per cent, too much
talk everywhere; further, Flemming’s own de-
lightfully easy, natural manner is developing into
an over-deliberation that tends to make things
drag. The best thing in the piece is the character
of the former lover, a well-meaning sportsman
without any backbone—the kind who can only
keep straight with a good woman’s hand to sup-
port him. Homewood’s playing of this part
makes the occasion a personal triumph for him.
Miss Day—to whom nothing seems to come amiss
—is artistic as the careless heroine ; and Miss
Mortyne and others give a more than adequate
support.

The rush of business to the King’s Theatre,
Melbourne, since “The Squatter’s Daughter”
was revived,-should suggest to Bent the advisa-
bility of appointing, on behalf of the Vic. Educa-
tion Department, a commission of inquiry into
the matter. Does the scenery, or the title, or the
bushrangeous character of Bailey and Duggan’s
great Australian circus-drama chiefly account for
its shocking popularity ? Would it be more popu-
lar if Ben Hall were to kill Geo. Cross and marry
the heroine in the last act? Or, on the other
hand, would five extra rows of reserved
stalls be urgently demanded if the tem-
pestuous bush girl (Miss Guildford) were to
carry a bag of snakes around and incite the largest
specimen to bite Ben Hall to slow music ? Death
by snakebite has not yet been introduced into this
country’s classic drama, neither has a log-chop-
ping contest, nor a milking tournament, as far as
the present scribe can remember. But they are
possibilities of the near future. Messrs. Bailey
and Duggan, it is said, have completed another
drama, to be entitled “The Man from Snowy
River,” and this will bristle with startling
national effects. Meanwhile “ The Squatter’s
Daughter ” continues to educate the public taste,
and matinees for the convenience of ladies and
children are happening on Wednesdays.
A revival of “Peter Pan,” at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.), confirms the first impression it
made upon receptive minds. It has its weak
moments, and its moments which are almost
great in their expression of poetical sentiment.
If the performance in some respects falls more
short of absolute and impossible perfection than
could be wished, it is quite superlatively good as
regards the Pirate Captain and much of the
artistic burlesque which radiates from his com-
manding presence. Moreover this is late in the
day to find fault with “ Peter Pan ” in
detail, whereas no time is too late for remark-
ing that such delicately-fanciful productions
are things to be spoken of with gratitude—
with more gratitude than they are likely to get.
The large number of Melbourne people who
stayed away from Her Majesty’s on Saturday
night have mostly come to the conclusion that
one helping of J. M. Barrie’s “creation” was all
they wanted. And yet this is essentially the
kind of novelty which any playgoer should sample
twice, to see whether it amounts to an acquired
taste. There is only one more week for inquiry
into this matter. Saturday after next Miss
Anglin and Melbourne’s dear old friend Tither-
adge will appear in “The Thief.”

Melbourne Princess’s is getting a week’s
rest between the departure of “ Mrs. Wiggs ” and
the arrival of “The Prince Chap.” Last Bulletin'
stated that H. R. Roberts and his own particular
comedy drama would come to light on Saturday,
but the exact date of the revelation was left open
to dispute. This Saturday (15th) is the day
appointed, and the time is 8 p.m., by which
hour the ladies in the audience are respectfully
desired to have their hats off.

Afe Melbourne Royal, “Two Little Sailor
Boys ” continue to love one another, and the cry
of “Muvver!” is as superabundant as before.
Indeed, “Muvver!” punctuates the tale like the
eerie “Hallelujahs!” of a Salv’army festival.
Thus every properly brought-up person yearns
fervidly for the gore of Mrs. Lola Grey, who
carries no muvverly instincts in the far interior of
her embonpoint. Lola is uniquely heterodox in
that respect. She repels the reckless affection of
her own pallid kid, and even attempts to bury his
supplicating bleat in the cold waters of a property
stream. Such unnaturalness merely intensifies
the primeval desire aforesaid ; nevertheless, indig-
nation is tempered by the thought that her
blood would damage her clothes. A pity.
Such garb as she affects deserves not destruction,
but an elegy. It is expensive, almost Mord
Hildyardian, and seems the visible embodiment of
Miss Lilian Myers’ fat, fruity elocution. For, just
so much as that lady is inclined to make every
word a meal, so is she suspected of making every
frock an anthem. But there are other things
than clothes in the latest production at the Royal.
For instance, there is a burglar who belts his
adopted son for insubordination, and in this scene
Miss Maisie Maxwell’s performance makes ample
amends for her unnatural devotion to muvver.

The Grand Prix Motor Race is this week’s
flicker de resistance at West’s Picture show.
Photographed in Paris on July 7, the film reached
Melbourne on August 10, which was so fast a per-
formance that the management rushed it into
print and called it “A Record Kinomatogram,”
A motor race on the screen is peculiarly interest-
ing on account of the question it raises as to
whether the cars beat the photographic apparatus,
or the apparatus travelled faster than the winning
mote.

The Hambourg concerts collected the Mel-
bourne musical world in an uproarious, shouting
crowd, with Jovian Marshall-Hall in the lead. On
Tuesday night the pocket-Rubinstein showed off his
60-h.p. speed gear while rattling through the
“ Moonlight Sonata.” A Chopin item was mostly
unmixed delight (Hambourg has genuine feeling
for Chopin), until a polonaise went to his head
and drove him into a wild gallop. A barcarolle
of Rubinstein’s dripped off his fingers like gentlest
raindrops. “ A Midsummer Night’s Dream ”
(Mendelssohn-Liszt) was the real cross between the
gentle and thefiery that the two composers present.
Thursday’s concert opened with variations on
“ The Harmonious Blacksmith.” That pandering
to popular palates over, Mark got going on the
“Greek Sonata”—that icy classic of classical
Beethoven—and did not let up until he nearly
raised the roof with his audience’s enthusiasm.
Truly it was a fine thing. Some Grieg, a rippling
of Schumann and a crashing singing Liszt
polonaise padded out this programme satis-
factorily. Mark is, above all things, a master of
effect. If he were a violinist he’d play Paga-
ninni mostly—just as if he were an orchestra he
would love to let himself go in vivid scarlet
Dvorak.

Tom Burrows, the machine-like person
who waves two lumps of wood round his head for
half-a-week at a time, went to Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Ballarat (Vic.), last week, and started,
in the small, dark hours of Monday morning, to
break his previous dreary record of 65 hours
20 minutes. During the whole of the day only a
handful of people were curious enough to pay
an entrance-fee for the privilege of seeing
meat shaking firewood, and in the evening
the populace stayed away so brilliantly that the
misguided athlete was left flourishing his timbers
mostly at the doorkeeper. At 11 o’clock the
management, having counted the takings and
found they totalled £3, realised that Ballarat
didn’t care if Burrows swung his clubs for 65
months, and after parleying with the human wind-
mill through a haze or veil of whirling tree he was
persuaded to stop. Then the battered atmo-
sphere regained its senses and the lights were put
out.

One Tod Lowen, who is understood to write
the words of his own songs, chanted those original
compositions from the stage of Melbourne Opera
House on Saturday—and was forgiven. Lowen’s
humor is not highly intellectual, but its puerility
leans to quaintness. Also it avoids unfavorable
comparison with the more robust absurdities of
Bluett, who has just returned to his old haunts.
Meymott is. burgling his wife’s jewels for some
more last nights, and the Arabs are as remarkable
as usual.
PETER PAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell
Came from where the fairies dwell—
Thus it was these things befell.
Peter Pan an elfin wight,
Tinker Bell a ball of light.
O’er the mountains, gay with heather,
Flew one day to town together.
“Yonder,” chirped a giddy starling,
“ Is the home of Wendy Darling.”
Wendy lay in bed a-sleeping :
Peter waked her with his weeping.
Bright as dew on sunflecked meadow
Peter’s tear drops shone.
All because he’d dropped his shadow,
Wendy stitched it on.
“ I’m the boy,” said Peter Pan,
“ Who refused to be a man.
Fly with me, and bring your brothers,
-To the Boys who’ve got no mothers
In the land afar—
Land of Never, Never, Never :
No one there is old or clever;
Fly with me and live for ever
Where the children are.”
Fast as Fancy’s wings could carry,
To the Never Land of Barrie,
Which is far beyond Belief
(Million miles from Pain and Grief),
Off they flew r , and lived awhile
Guarded by a crocodile.
In whose tender thorax sticking
A ten-year clock was loudly ticking.
(N.B. —The bard invites a smile
By terming it a clockodile.)
Gaunt, hungry wolves gave over snarling
When told it worried Wendy Darling;
Grim Pirates who had threatened slaughter,
Met sudden deaths by sword or water ;
And roaring lions turned and ran
When gazed upon by Peter Pan.
Things in the Never Land went well—
Except with jealous Tinker Bell.
The parents she had left behind
Passed out of Wendy’s fickle mind,
She having found maternal joys
In “ mothering ” a mob of boys.
Then came to Peter Pan, alack !
The thought that he must take her back—
Back to the weary world of lies,
Where little boys grow old and wise.
And now, together with her brothers,
And all the twins who wanted mothers,
She lives in town, where, sad to say.
She’s doomed to wear her life away.
But when the birds and blossoms sing
Their song of love in vernal Spring,
The woman who is on the wane
Becomes a careless child again,
And flies away to Peter Pan,
The boy who would not be a man..
For flesh must die and turn to mould,
But Love refuses to grow old.
AT POVERTY POINT.
John Archibald Crain (otherwise “Jack” Crain), a
writer of many theatrical reminiscences and other
"o°d matter in Tub Bulletin, passed out last
week. He was a Caledonian Irishman, his mother
hailing- from Glasgow—she was of old Covenanter
■descwit and his father from Victor Haley’s countv of
Armagh. He was learning the civil engineering profes-
sion in the Clyde-side city when he made the luckless dis-
covery that he had a fine tenor voice, and thereafter he
abandoned all hope of a steady and remunerative pro-
fession, and became a Bohemian on the face of the earth.
Instead of investing his little pile in a whelk-stall or a
smithy, or some such remunerative biz, he went to Milan
and learned all in the way of singing that it had
to teach. Riccardi and Steffani were his fellow-
students in the old Italian city. When he was
finished with Milan, Crain went back to England to lift
his voice for a cash consideration, but he had
grown used to a better climate, and presently he fled in
dismay to Auckland (M.L.). Here he struck Riccardi
and Charles Harding, and out of the meeting <r re w
Riccardi’s Comic Opera Co., and from that evolved
Harding and Crain’s Opera Co. Among the many things
■done by “Jack" in that connection the fact that he
created (and created exceedingly well) the part of Ralph
Rackstraw in “Pinafore” is best remembered. He lost
his money in the firm ; it sang well and acted well and
did its business management lamentably. He then went
to head a new venture in Tasmania, whence he was sum-
moned in haste to Sydney to support the great Oarlotta
vatti. He was a leading tenor in Sydney for a long time,
till a lung trouble robbed him of his voice. After that he
pegged in manfully at journalism. He was one
of the props of L’ltalo-Austra-liano, and in
between times he contributed paragraphs, theatri-
cal reminiscences and humorous items to The
Bulletin and other papers. For quite a number
() years his health was bad and his luck was none too
good, but he was always cheerful, and showed a brave
front to the world. A big, happy, lumbering wreck of a
man, walking with difficulty (he suffered from a complica-
tion of troubles in his later years), coughing with diffi-
culty, yet never taking a despondent view of the world—
that was “Jack "Crain as most people recollect him. He
was appointed editor of a new venture, White Australia,
but pneumonia struck him before the first number was
re j j’ ke * n Sydney Hospital—still cheerful,
and devising features for his new paper till the very last.
~ ” : H. Rickards had some impressive folk on
his Melbourne programme just lately. First, there was
Austin Rudd, a rather fat little man, who warbled of
forty young ladies in their—ahem 1 nighties’’—with an
expression of arch significance. He had also something
to say about bathing and beer, and broke the audience
up by his interpretation of those two nice, fresh subjects.
Then there were four damsels—the Four Soapsuds, or
Be th'hg—who endeavored to be genial against fearful
odds. Their passion in life is seemingly a lady named
Lou, who is urged to “love me, do!”—a sad yearning
uitty altogether, the ineffableness of which is emphasised
by giddy kicks audiencewards. Later on, they declared
that they were “ the coquettesof the Strand,” which quite
a number of people refused to believe without affidavits
to that effect. But the most original creature was one
Leonard Nelson. Leonard fled on to the premises in a
false beard, old pants vvith bowyangs, shirt and hat. His
hand clasped an antiquated micky. Quoth Leonard,
with conviction, “The dawn is breaking,’’and so that
there should be no doubt about such a reckless state-
ment, some unfortunate being had to drag a heap of iron-
mongery very noisily from one wing to the other, where
the noise ended with a crash. Said Leonard, with ter-
rible meaning, “ The dawn has broke,” or “ broken,”
whereat three boys in the gallery laughed audibly.
Leonard made other amazing declarations with similar
means of illustration, and generally achieved an artistic
triumph. There were other people on the bill, and some
of them treated the populace to a stream of equally
ferocious fatuity. One meets .with terrible experiences
at a theatre of variety.
“Akenehi”: The interviewers in London have been
telling the great donkey-eared British Public that
the Butts have been telling them, that the devoted
pair’s bank balance grew to the extent of £51,000
through the Australian tour. One can’t, of course,
say “Rats!” because “Rats!” is rude; but—well,
the Rumford bank balance must grow amazingly
during a sea voyage. The pair gave 75 concerts, or
thereabouts, in these sunshiny parts and in Maoriland ;
and 75 into £51,000 used to be £6BO and nothing over if
they teach arithmetic like they used to when I wore
ankle-strap shoes and val. lace on my pinnies. The
average price paid to hear the great Butt was certainly
not more than Bs. (amazing the number of people who
don’t pay anything at all that one finds in the places
marked “ This lot one guinea ”). Then, even for the gross
receipts to reach £51,000, the 75 concerts would have re-
quired an average paying attendance of 1600 or 1700 ; and
when you remember that the contralto boomed at Albury
and Sale and such places, vou know that average
is just impossible. Sydney Town Hall certainly
holds 3000 people; but, even if vou pack it, only
2200 people can get colds in Melbourne Town Hall at
once ; and from that eminence the seating accommoda-
tion of Australian halls topples down furiously. A liberal
estimate puts the average attendance at 800 for the 75
concerts, or 60,000 altogether ; and if, after paying rent,
lighting, and other expenses, the pair cleared even ss. a
head, the total would still be only £15,000. That’s what
must be wrong—the interviewers really didn’t think it
mattered whether they put the 1 first, or the 5. But it
will matter a lot to those managers who by-and-bye will
tr.V and snare some other great foreign artist to Aus-
tralia, and who will be met with, “Oh, nonsense ! The
Butts made £51,000 out there.” Whereupon the manager
will either have to regretfully decline business, or attempt
to squeeze out of Australians the same shockingly high
prices that have been charged on a few occasions lately.
“0.K.”: The Bulletin dropped into a natural con-
fusion of names when it referred to the conductor of
Williamson’s musical comedy orchestra as Harold Carr.
The tall young man in question is Howard Carr. Never-
theless, he has so often been addressed as Harold that
he accepts the misnomer with all the courtesy due to the
inevitable. There is a Harold Carr in the musical line.
The two men are not of one family, but their baptismal
names are near akin. Such names are rocked in couples
in the cradle of one’s memory, and one easily mixes them
up.
A grand fancy and evening-dress carnival is announced
to be held next Wednesday evening at the Melbourne
Glaciarium. It is claimed that the spectacle will be the
finest yet seen.
“The Truth” doesn’t contain a single epi-
gram. I would like to seek out the man Fitch, and wring
his hand in an ecstasy of gratitude. I am sick of
epigrams. They began to weary me slightly about ten
years ago. I am a gregarious soul who yearns to be
m accord with his fellow man, and hearing various
liars of my acquaintance protest stoutly that they
loved this form of parley, I struggled against my growing
hatred of it. In vain. With each new comedy I saw I
loathed the epigram and its badly-trained stable com-
panion, the paradox, more and more. I took to
frequenting (a) melodramas, (b) music halls, (c) prize
?%• Islmll never, forget the night I heard the villain
in The Horrible Wedding,” who was being urged tearfully
by an elderly moralist from Mangel-Wurzelshire to make
an honest woman of his most recent victim, reply cyni-
cally flicking the ash from his cigarette: “Marriage is
the last insult one offers to a woman one resnects ” Amid
the storm of hoots that followed I left. The thino- has
crept insidiously into the music-hall of late years' “I
cannot afford to tale in washing”; “I get drunk on
gm for the sake of the Higher Morality,” etc., etc Such
painful quips issue nightly from red-nosed, zebra-strined
outrages at every variety show. “Larry ” Foley ground
out a batch very little brighter than the above at the
recent reception to Bill Squires; and the first thing
Noah Brusso Burns said to the Sydney Telegraph
interviewer was that “ he had never hurt a man in his
life. The success of Fitch’s epigramless plav encourages
me. I think this form of humor is doomed. * b
The three Russian musicians, Jan, Leo, and Mischel
Cherniavaski, whom Edward Branscombe has engaged
for an Australian tour, will introduce themselves to this
country at Melbourne Town Hall on the 19th September
The date is a point in their favor. Musical ventures in Mel
bourne have for years been suffering from the weather
and if managers are well advised, they will in future
treat June, July, and August as a close season for Town
Hall entertainments. People in general are indisposed to
go forth on damp nights to catch cold in the draughtv
municipal barn and wilderness. ® J
“Sinovitch”: Is there any Russian Nihilist plav
extant which does not contain a female character called
Olga ? If so, I d like to see it—a mere whim.
“Parvenu”: I’m fearfully angry with “Ami ” foreallino-
me (30/7/’08)a “ veteran actor.” I can stand a charo-S
till-bursting with more or less equanimity, but to be
accused of mumming is passing hard. Dan Barry never
owed me or anyone else half a quid. It was Daniel’s
strong point (even as it was that of the proverbial black
smith) to “owe not any man.” “Ami” wishes me to
cast up the number of times Dan played leads at the
Melbourne Alexandra. It would fill too much space bub
here are a few instances: He played Ned Kellv in “ The
Kelly Gang,” Murphy in “The Roll of the Drum”
(Murphy was introduced apropos of nothing for Dan’s
especial benefit), the Rev. Mr. North in “His
Natural Life” (the part always played by Dampier)
Q ln . Ur ‘de Tom’s Cabin,” and Frank Slade in
Ten Nights in a Bar-room ’’—the one comparatively bad
part in the five named. The only time Barry played a
sma.ll part was when he would otherwise have had to
study a new one. Fresh studies were his pet aversion
As an example of the versatile actor Barry thought he
was, he played Mark Milton, the lead of leads in
Current Cash,” at Newcastle; Peter Crawley with
song “ Good Mr. Meadows,” in “ Never too Late to
■ e J] mi at tle Aleck > anc * Simon Waldron, the heavy lead
in The Modern Cain”—this on his last tour. “Ami”
insists that “ Barry’s physique was thin,” and, “to make
sure of being heard, he had to fling out his sentences like
pistol shots.” Great gohannas! Dan’s corporation was
as prominent as Bent’s, and as for his manner of speak
ing; it was his way, and had no more to do with physical
frailty than it had with dynamite. For unreliability
Ami ”is the limit—so much so that if I knew the theatre
where he supers I would make it my business to call
round and get him fired. 11
HIS FAVORITE PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His name is Harold Montague,
He is a leading juvenile ;
His photographs are all on view—
They reproduce his famous smile,
His well-known dimple, traced with care,
And his distinguished head of hair.
He is the rage in tea-rooms gay,
And milliners adore his looks ;
White-workers talk of him all day,
And nurses love him—so do cooks.
By hook or crook, by day or night,
This man is never out of sight.
Upon the stage, I must admit,
Hear Harold’s work is only slight.
He poses much, and sings a bit,
And hustles smartly for the “ light.”
Perhaps to make so much ado
In doing nought needs talent too.
But in the street, at parties, and
At dances he is quite unique.
The moments when he’s truly grand
Are those of which no critics speak.
His masterpiece of acting true
Is Mr. Harold Montague !

It is five years now since the Victorian
railway strike, but to this day the blackleg driver,
as a rule, drives his train along in dead silence,
and his union fireman shovels coal in dead silence,
and there is no speech between them. The curse of
being a “scab ” is a curse that will never be lifted.
For this reason, the Sydney tramway depart-
ment did its best for a while to put a blackleg driver
and a blackleg conductor together, even as two
lepers might be put on one island to prevent the
other leper feeling lonelj' or singular; but
now, according to all accounts, most of the
blackleg drivers have been reduced, by
reason of their incapacity, to conducting. Report
says that the official tests have been practically
suspended as regards the blacklegs ; when the
testing process was first started they went out
wholesale for inability to come up to the
standard, so the painful question was dropped or
postponed. Report also alleges that any new bags
that may be in use are carried by old conductors,
and that the new blackleg conductor always has
an old bag. Some people have an idea that a
conductor’s bag is his own property, and that the
new men brought nice fresh bags into the service ;
so the present method —that is how the popular
story has it —saves the new men from opprobrium,
and lets any opprobrium that may be floating
around fall on ; the old men. If these reports are
true they suggest a fair amount of ingenuity on the
part of somebody.

An aged petitioner in Melbourne Divorce
Court, last week, was remarkable for being the
brother-in-law of his own daughter-in-law. He
and son Job had married two sisters, but whereas
Job’s wife is still living with her husband, the
sister who paired off with Job’s father has proved
a faithless baggage. She lived with her old man
for a week or so, ’way up in Alexandra (Vic.), after
which he went away to get work and ruminate.
He was 64, and a weary toiler at that, when he
riveted his affections upon Mary, who was 19.
Probably his exile was saddened by reflections
upon the disparity in their ages. But after a
week’s absence he returned to his bride, and she
kicked him until he fled. Then she threw stones
at his retreating form. Subsequently she broke
him up with a poem of dismissal, beginning with
“Go and leave me, I don’t want you.” The
moral is very pointed. No gentleman on the
shady side of 60 should marry the youthful sister
of his son Job’s wife.
Chinese furniture-making bosses swagger
about confidently since the publication of John
Hoe’s declaration in S. M. Hkualix John Hoe
voiced Sydney Chinadom in his.shriek about the
high wages paid by the John community, and Chow
firms repeat his challenge to examine men and
books. That examination, they maintain, will
prove the Chow boss pays higher wages and works
his men shorter hours than does the white boss in
the furniture line. A similar challenge, thrown
out in Melbourne, led to the appearance of Quoon
Lee and Co. before a Bench of magistrates
lately, on a charge under the Factories
Act, and Barrister Purves, who represented
the Chow employers, blandly stated certain illumi-
nating facts. He admitted that the Act pre-
scribed 565. per week for workers, but held on
behalf of his clients that it didn’t say when that
amount was to be paid. In Quong Loon’s case it
seemed liable to become a good many years over-
due. On that basis the Chow furniture-maker
boss can very easily pay (or owe) higher wages
than the white man, and can produce books of a
certain sort to hack up the statement. It might
be worth while to test John Hoe’s brag about the
wages of Chowdom in Sydney.

The Sydney egg trade broke into public
notice through a deputation of poultry raisers who
waited on Minister Perry to complain of the way
their bran and pollard was being adulterated.
The conversation strayed on to eggs, and the de-
putation spoke violently about the 2,000,000 of
hen output that were allegedly brought over from
Adelaide last year and sold to “ the trade” at Id.
to 3d. a dozen. Of course, the long-distance egg
isn’t likely to be quite so fresh as the short-range
egg, and the threepence-a-dozen-egg is always
open to suspicion, and no one expects any eggist
to take a charitable view of the rival egg pub-
lished by his loathsome hentemporary. But even
making all allowances, the statement that the
disreputable elderly harridan of an egg is broken
and put through a fine sieve to prevent the
chicken from getting into the pastry is a stagger-
ing sort of a remark.

The imperturbable Chinee was again in
evidence on the N.D.L. steamer Prinz Walde-
mar at Sydney last week. Suspecting stow-
aways, the Customs people had ransacked the
vessel without success. But Donohue, the old dog
of the staff, wasn’t satisfied. He had had a “ tip,”
and knew it was a good one, though all his search-
ing had revealed nothing. So, at midnight, after
all the Chinese crew were asleep, Donohue and a
companion made their way unannounced into the
engine room. Result, nil. They probed about at
great length, and were just about giving it up
when attention was directed to what looked
like heaps of mere dust and grease on
top of the boilers. Under this were nine
Chows. They had lain motionless in their
filthy bed for at least 24 hours, and when dragged
out could hardly be recognised as human. One of
the reasons for the Chinaman’s success as a stow-
away is his capacity for remaining quite motion-
less for about a week at a stretch, and passing
himself off as coal or dirt, or some such old sub-
stance of no importance.

Vic. Insolvency Judge Moule lately
pointed out the straight and narrow path to that
State’s prospective and possible insolvents. When
Timothy O’Hanlon went bung, after 12 months
in a store at Lilydale, he owed some £270 ; and,
after selling his business, his assets totalled about
£lBO. Having paid £2O worth of local debts in full,
O'Hanlon picked up his household goods and his
family, and went to Melbourne to talk to his
Yarra-side creditors. But being on the way to see
one of them next morning, with £3B
in his pocket, he happened across
a friend wdio was simply dying to
take him out to the races and
put him on a good thing for
the Ascot Cup. Mr. O’Hanlon
went to the races, backed
the good thing, and re-
turned, home with £75 in his
pocket. That, as Judge
Moule remarked, settled him
completely. What were a
few pounds to him who
could make £2O or £3O a
day by backing “ good
things”? Making no fur-
ther attempt to see his
creditors, he boldly went to
Flemington, to Caulfield,
Epsom, Williamstown, and
other courses, until all the
money had disappeared. After
informing Timothy that he had
started business with insufficient
capital, had kept his books in a non-
descript fashion, and had withdrawn
capital for personal expenses with-
out making any attempt to replace
it. Judge Moule quoted sec. 141 of
the Insolvency Act, which deals
with people who gamble with the
only means they have for paying their
creditors. And then, having quoted his
text, his Honor preached a brief sermon to
the effect that Timothy must go without a certi-

sometimes grows very reckless, but seldom over-
looks its Nose. Nose is in everything it takes up.
And the Jewish Aid Society of Melbourne is a
typically Nosey institution. It isn’t an aid
society in the Gentile sense. It gives nothing,
unless it is sick or drunk ; but it £ends. And it
doesn’t Send blankets, soap, or picture-postcards.
It Sends money to the more indigent Noses. It
has been doing that for 20 years very obscurely
and without any blare, and alleges that 1354 cases
have been dealt with to the tune of £lB,OOO. It is
a fairly substantial tune, and almost amounts to
an anthem, and it would be a whole choral society,
perhaps, if any information were supplied about
the interest. It can hardly be that a Jewish Aid
Society lends money without interest.
HOW FAR?
[For Tub Bulletin.]
The Legislative Investigation Committee, sitting at
Alabama, elicited some remarkable evidence respecting
the State convict leasing system practised by the Southern
States. It was shown that at one State prison farm con-
victs were lined up and sold like mules to the highest
bidder. One convict was leased out in exchange for
seven negroes because he possessed clerical ability. A
white boy, who was leased, was whipped to death for
spilling coffee on a dog.— United States cablegram.
The calm stars shine upon the lifeless clay,
And glazing eyes that mutely plead to God
For vengeance for a young life done away
Because, o’er duty, sense had dared to nod !
From his weak frame the ruthless lash has shorn
The bonds that held his spirit down to earth ;
And now he lies in death not more forlorn ' ,
Than he had lived forlornly,since his birth.!
The news is flashed by cable from afar !
He spilt some coffee on a dog, this slave,
And now he’s dead ! That’s all! His lucky’ star
At long last beariis upon his new-dug grave !
No brutal blow can maim him any more !
He lies there huddled —lifeless as a log !
Oh. yes, he’s dead, my worthy 7 masters, for
He chanced to spill some coffee on a dog !
The calm stars shine ; we muddle smugly 7 on,
And, from these levels where to-day we are,
Gaze cold contempt upon dark ages gone,
And say 7 we have progressed ! Good Lord, how far ?

In Fiji they have a leaven of gentle Indian
in the population. (There are about 17,001)
Indians to 97,000 Fijians and whites.) The
following from the Western Pacific Herald
(10/7/’08) shows how the Indian compares in the
matter of crime with the rest of the population
The July criminal sessions will commence before his
Honor thediief Justice on 21st instant. The following
is the calendar Ghul Mahomed (Indian), attempted
murder, Ba ; Azad Khan (Indian), escaping from' gaol,
Ba; Gungar (Indian), murder, Macuata; Khubi
(Indian), murder, Rewa; Alivoreti Vodre (Fijian),
attempted suicide, Kadavu ; A. Q. McGowan, offence
under Bankruptcy Act, Suva ; Uraia Tabuarua (Fijian),
murder, Suva; Ramanath (Indian), escape from lawful
custody, Suva; Mahabir Singh and Naraijan Singh
(Indians), setting fire to a dwelling-house, some persons
being therein ; Budhu and three others (Indians), Ba,
robbery with violence ; Sultan Singh and three others
(Indians), burglary, Ba ; Aladat and Nathan (Indians),
murder, Navua : Ruveni Rokoita (Fijian), carnal know-
ledge, Rewa ; Ramcharan (Indian), Navur, murder;
Tulsi Ram (Indian), murder, Ba.
Total, 19 Indians, three Fijians, and one white.
And the Hindu record is six murders, four bur-
glaries, four cases of robbery with violence, two
cases of arson, two of gaol-breaking, and one
attempted murder. A curiously violent person
our brownish fellow-subject seems to be. He is a
mere handful of the community, yet he seems to
provide 83 per cent, of the crime.
THE DANCE AND THE DEVIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Alderman Forsyth : I have no objection to the resi-
dents having amusement, but dancing I do object to.
Alderman Gonsalves : I think dancing is the best and
most moral sport there is on the face of God’s green
earth, and the man that does not indulge in dancing must
have something physically wrong with him, and ought to
see a doctor at once. —Yaucluse (Sydney) council debate.
When toothless Age goes skipping by
And smirks and bows before each tree,
Turn not a swift, suspicious eye
Nor think it is insanity ;
A wise man as he older grows
Insists he’s sound as any bell;
He treats with scorn all medicoes
And leaps about to show he’s well.
O ! drag the student from his book,
And chase professors from their chairs ;
Rejoice when sounds betray the cook
Is waltzing with the maid downstairs.
Urge all the Force to dance along
And agitate their mighty feet,
And with the lady who’s gone wrong
Do gay schottisches on the beat.
What though the Devil loves a waltz,
And threads the lancers’ merry maze?
I'd rather have him with his faults
Than those sad folk who spend their days
Bemoaning us. So, make your bow !
Come, seize the joy Life has in store !
I love to hear the joyous row
Of his gay hoofs upon the floor.

There is pathos in everything, even in
George Robert Beere’s rambling address from the
dock at Melbourne General Sessions, after he had
been convicted of obtaining postcards by false
pretences. For example -
I was to have been married to a girl who came in for
£2OO, and she would have given me whatever money I
wanted. If the Court passes sentence upon me her life
will be ruined as well as mine. I could never marry her.
The wedding bells would not ring out. They will rather
ring out a death knell to our hopes. The clergyman had
been engaged, and only the ceremony remained to be
performed to make two loving hearts one. But now our
joy has been turned to sorrow, and all for the small sum
of 6s. 6d. For twelve months past I have been teaching
in a Sunday-school. ... I ask your Honor to temper
justice with mercy. I have spent mv life in rescuing
others, and now I shall be sent to prison, and I suppose
that the hope I had of seeing the American Fleet will be
dashed to the ground.
Whereupon Judge Box smote him with a sentence
of 12 months hard labor.
Within the pale of Melbourne Gaol,
For fifty weeks or more,
George Robert Beere must shed the tear
Of bitterness galore.
With sympathy for such as he
The toughest bosoms beat.
Heigho ! if he were only free
To go and see the Fleet 1
Devoid of hope, he’s picking rope,
Or mooching round the yard ;
Securely caged, he is engaged
In doing “ 12 months hard.”
But when he falls asleep at night
His dreams are long and sweet;
Then comes a vision of delight—
A vision of the Fleet.
Can burly Bent withhold consent
To Brother Beere’s release ?
A little while from durance vile
Let him depart in peace.
The learned Judge will not begrudge
The prisoner this treat—
One week, one day, to go away,
And gaze upon the Fleet.

While Parson Nas h has become a fashionable
fad in Melbourne, Parson Gladstone, of the same
church, has lapsed into obscurity. Rash became
a burning sensation because of an alleged Past;
while Gladstone sputtered feebly like a wet
match, chiefly because he could or would not
seduce the filthy lucre of the Very Best People.
Whatever Nash did, it could not have been of less
heinousness than the thing 1 charg’ed to Gladstone;
but if press-booming and the screeching of pro-
and anti-Nashites are criteria, Nash is a
saint of unearthly spotlessness, while Glad-
stone, by contrast, is quite unimportant.
Little is said of Gladstone, who, the other
day, bloomed. into momentary publicity in
connection with his new Reformed Church of
England. The howl is all of Nash. And all
because Nash came from the pretentious, genteel
subbu bof Hawthorn, where the vineyard is streaked
with golden girl and fat old idolatrous ladies ;
while poor old Gladstone belted Scripture into
the country village of Nathalia, where the vine-
yard is either mortgaged or overrun with Cow.
It is a biting commentary on the influence of
Sassiety in Church matters.

The £5OO which the Australian Parlia-

Sydney s 41 pocket-hanky municipalities
are ambitious to shine in the costume line. Ash-
field, a pretentious little western suburb, has
gone in for a mayoral costume. In most of the
places where the costume mania exists the cos-
tume maniacs aim at something fluffy and furry,
like a cat’s tail; but Ashfield has decided on
“ black silk, old-gold facings, scarlet lining, and a
lace collar.” Marrickville. which is in the district
that elects Johnson, M.H.R.
(and therefore almost any-
thing might be expected
of it), has seriously con-
sidered the question of
mayoral robes and
aldermen in evening
dress. A tiny little
village called
Bankstown, near
Sydney, has a cos-
tumed mayor,
whose robes are
almost as gorgeous
as those of the
Lord Mayor of
London, and in-
clude a three-
cornered hat —it
may even go one
corner better, and
be a rectangular
hat. The Lord
Mayor of Sydney
has a chain added
to the hairy robes
of office, and the
sight of “Tom”
Hughes, the pre-
sent Lord Mayor
(who is a fine,
strong, healthy man, God bless him !), on a hot
summer’s night, with the temperature at 100°,
sweltering in his furs, and the sweat falling on the
barrister’s wig of the Town Clerk in front of him,
would move a stone to pity. Before long, these
41 twopenny-halfpenny civic cabbage-patches
will be asking for lord mayoralties. And then
Sydney will have 41 lord mayors and 41 little
Sydneys, all full of robes and cat’s tail and
overdrafts.

The Sydney Clerks’ Union shows that, after
all, there are clerks with a backbone, and that
the clerk with a backbone is an energetic person.
The Clerks’ Union is not many months old, and
hasn’t nearly the membership it ought to have,
but its fighting record is good. It started opera-
tions by a protest against the wages paid to shire
and municipal clerks, and the publicity given to
the protest caused some shires to alter their
sweating ways. It made representations which
apparently secured redress for some solid griev-
ances by which clerks in the Post Office suffered ;
at all events, the grievances were remedied. And
it made revelations about sweating, over-
time, and breaches of the Factory Act in some
city houses, over which trouble is still threaten-
ing. Moreover, the agitation has caused an un-
wonted briskness in the Factory Act officers,
and led to a considerable change in many com-
mercial houses. The Union has done other
things, and at the present time is worrying various
people about the coercion exercised over clerks,
and the continual overtime worked in the Savings
Bank.
The captain and crew of the French barque
Max begin to be aweary of trapesing round the
Seven Seas to no purpose. The Max was despatched
from Havre to Hobart in Nov., 1907, for orders.
When she arrived at Hobart the orders sent her
on to ’Frisco for more orders. The more orders told
her to get back to Hobart for some further orders.
She called in at Sydney on the way for the further
orders the other day ; and later, while rounding
Green Cape, the elements took a hand and drove
her back to the Beautiful Harbor again. There
the skipper stopped and cabled his owners to get
him a charter or come and chase orders themselves.
It is one of the quaint facts of Private Enterprise
that it just loves to hump things to and fro, and
when it can’t get any goods to hump it just carts
itself back and forth.
One Melbourne citizen is saying most in-
sulting things about the local. Board of Works.
He and his wife were sleeping peacefully after a
placid Sunday’s r.est, when the water main out-
side burst, and.a cartload of. blue metal, cinders,
mud, and Yan Yean projected itself through the
window. They were a surprised pair for a few
minutes, but they managed to escape drowning ;
and while the wife sat on the cold back fence in her
Disher Bill, the housefather ran around, discovered
the turncock, and got the avalanche shut off. In the
morning he found his wife very ill, his furniture
and household accoutrements ruined, and his house
a water-logged wreck ; so he interviewed the
Board re compensation. But that Timber
remarked that under its Act it wasn’t
liable for any such damage unless negligence
could be shown, and as the citizen couldn’t prove
negligence the Board courteously wished him
good morning. The occurrence illustrates one
of the abiding joys of Melbourne life. The Board
of Shirks never dreams of i-enewing its pipes ex-
cept to insert a larger one where needed, or unless
one bursts—and then it only puts one length in.
Also most of the pipes are only a foot or two
underground, and when they crack, With several
thousand tons of water tearing things up, there is
a great sloppy mess. And some of the
pipes are reputedly about 50 years old,
so they ofterl crack. Afterwards, when any
aggrieved and muddy citizen talks about damages
and compensation, the Board is the essence of
courtesy, and carries on as though the citizen had
just acquired a fortune, or married a new wife, or
something.

Hindmarsh, one of the Adelaide suburbs
where they tan hides and make bricks and bad
smells, has been haying its back premises viewed
by Board of Health Officer Dr. Coombe, who also
looked in at a few butcheries. On the outside,
especially if you view them from the front,
Adelaide and suburbs look as clean as a bone after
11 lawyers have picked it ; but it isn’t always
safe to inquire within. Anybody, for instance,
can be a butcher; and the butcher around
Adelaide has his own slaughter-yard, which is
mostly stuck away in some remote place, too
objectionable to be used for anything else. ' Pok-
ing his nose into the Hindmarsh shambles, Dr.
Coombe found them “generally dirty, untidy, and
filthy, and the floors were covered with blood,
offal, etc., etc. The hooks on which the meat
was hung were dirty, rusty, covered with stale
blood and fly dirt.” And as for the shops :
Some plucks of sheep hanging in the shop were diseased
and unfit for human consumption.
Here some meat exhibited was really unfit for human
consumption.
Some of the meat exhibited was poor and of doubtful
class.
Some of the meat unfit for human consumption.
The health officer drops now and then into par-
ticulars ; but when it has been told that the hook
that the meat hangs on is filthy, and the floor that
the meat is dragged over is filthy, and the meat
that hangs on the filthy hook over the filthy floor
is diseased and unfit for human consumption,
Hindmarsh has probably heard enough to drive it
to a diet of potatoes. If potatoes are out of the
question, then it might almost be an improvement
to try boiled chaff.

“ Mate,” re Courts of Marine Inquiry :
The gentlemen who are decorated with trimmings from
a defunct gee-gee are too fond of dropping heavily on the
unfortunate shipmaster who has made a mistake. They
sit in comfortable armchairs and have things explained
to them at great length for a great heap of hours. Then
they reserve judgment and think the matter out at
greater length, always in comfort. They come back and
announce that, there was a grave error of judgment, and
the master’s ticket is suspended for 12 months. He, most
likely, had to act first and do his thinking afterwards.
If a Judge had to listen to two lawyers—for opposite
sides—at the same time, and give his judgment before
they’d finished talking—knowing that his billet depended
on the judgment being correct—he might have a better
understanding of the conditions a shipmaster works
under.
When a case is reversed on appeal to a higher court,
nothing happens to the Judge who is proved to be
ignorant of his business. I propose that a Judge whose
judgment is reversed should have to pay the Costs of his
own incorrect decision and have his certificate suspended
for three months for bad navigation.
Gentlemen who wish to look smart, should
pay a visit to Wild’s hairdressing saloon, where six
first-class artists are engaged. The establish-
ment is under the Patronage of Lord Northcote.

suitable place for harboring organisms of all kinds than a
dark telephone call-box, with its stagnant air and dirty
floor, the dust of which is brought in from the street and
stirred up and inhaled by each fresh caller.— -News item.

In atmosphere of human breath
And subtle waves of sound.

And in a baby’s sneeze.

Are ever present on the scene :
They save the King, or kill the Queen,

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The State Treasury figures for July, the first
month of the financial year, have a damp, sodden look.
Compared with those for July, 1907, they gloom in this
way :
July, 1907. July, 1908.
N.S. Wales ..£1,126,286 £1,069,317 Dec. £56,969
Victoria .. 765,181 605,230 Dec. 159,951
Queensland .. 360,347 407,304 Inc. 46,957
S. Australia .. Too slow to produce monthly figures.
Westralia .. 190,005 161,619 Dec. 28,386
Tasmania .. 70,227 55,218 Dec. 12,009
The", comparison, however, makes things look really worse
than they are. Twelve months ago, in view of the ap-
proaching Lyne tariff, merchants loaded up, and there
was a flood of Customs receipts. The flood has long since
ebbed. The Commonwealth Customs revenue was, there-
fore, for last month only £1,018,158, as against £1,239,999
for July, 1907. The payments to the States show a still
larger shrinkage on account of the Commonwealth having
partially got out of its bad habit of starving itself in
order to provide the State Treasurers with surpluses.
Victoria received £152,963 less in July, 1908, than in
July, 1907, and N.S.W. £50,033 less. Prosperous Queens-
land, on the other hand, received £28,468 more.
The expenditure figures are, as usual, meagre :
July, 1907. July, 1908.
N. S. Wales .. £1,118,775 £1,026,242 Dec. £92,533
Queensland .. 190,715 255,723 Inc. 65,008
Westralia .. 201,910 209,379 Inc. 7,469
Queensland, however, doesn’t charge up its interest till
the end of the half-year. Westralia had a deficit of
£47,759 for the month—and Westralia is the State
whose Premier hifaluted the other day about the
enormous number of tons of gold and millions of
pounds of dividends that foreign cos. were carting
awa}\ N. S. Wales, having sacked a Treasurer because
of his frightful behavior in borrowing £2,500,000 a year,
has given up its drunken ways, and Reformed, and
now borrows at the rate of £2,300,000 a year. The
loan money bill for July was £190,047. It is much
like an old boozer taking the platform at a Y.M.C.A.
temperance meeting, and thanking the Lord that he is
a changed man, because nowadays he blows the froth
off before he swallows the same old amount of beer.

A Trust, representing the municipalities, built the tram
lines, and gave this co. a lease of them till July 1,1916-
eight years from now. The co. had to find the rolling-
stock, keep the lines in repair, pay interest on the Trust’s
borrowings, provide a sinking fund for the extinction of
the debt, and finally hand back the lines in good working
order. The sinking-fund contribution was graduated ;
till 1905 it was £33,000 a year, and since then it has been
£45,000 a year. The amount borrowed by the Trust was
£1,650,000 ; but, as the rate of interest was per cent.,
the loans were issued at a total premium of £55,794. The
co.’s own capital was £250,000 ; but a further £230,000 of
profit was capitalised. In the foregoing table the cal-
culations are made on the basis of the £250,000 actually
paid. Actually, therefore, the business has given the
following return during the past two years :
1907. 1908.
Profit as shown above .. .. £137,661 £148,315
Sinking fund for Trust .. .. 45,000 45,000
Trust’s debent, interest .. .. 74,250 74,250
, Total £256,911 £267,565
LesS int. on co.’s investments .. 25,598 26,190
Net revenue of undertaking .. £231,313 £241,375
The capital put in by the Trust was, as shown just now,
£1,705,794. The co. has apparently about £405,000 in
the business. Lumping the two together, representing
the whole capital of the undertaking, it will be found
that the return is about £ll Bs. 6d. per cent. That is to
say, Melbourne is charged for its tram-rides enough to
show a return of £ll Bs. 6d. per cent., while, according
to the last published report of the N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioners, the Ma State was only required to pay enough
to show a return of £4 .18s. Bd. per cent, on the Govern-
ment trams of N.S.W.
The reserves are made up as follows :
1906. 1907. 1908.

The renewal reserve, for instance, has been cut into

£24,117 was spent; of that, £7314, however, was charged
‘direct to working expenses, the balance coming out of
itbe^reserve. The lines, etc., have to be handed over in
igood condition; therefore, there may be a further
■call upon this reserve during the next eight years.

There is, in addition, a wasting asset, “ Leasehold proper-
ties, £12,123,” which is being steadily written down. Add
that to the surplus ; total, £1,115,430, which is the
amount of the actually-paid capital (£250,000) plus the
reserves shown above (£865,430). Now, as to the deprecia-
tion reserve, it can only be required for the two items,
“ Freeholds ” and “Other property’’—the latter mostly
rolling stock. The Trust, at the end of the eight years,
may not want the rolling stock and a number of the co. s
properties ; in that case, some of them would have to be
quitted at a sacrifice. No doubt if the Trust could have
command of the lines for 12 months previous to July 1,
1916, a whole lot of the stock would be obsolete, because
the Trust would probably have sense enough during that
period to electrify the system. The trouble, however, is
that the Trust won’t be able to come in until the co. goes
out; and, unless some way out of that trouble can he
found, it will have to carry on the business with the co.’s
rolling stock while the inevitable change is being made
from cable to electric traction. Consequently if it has to
take over the co.’s plant and rolling stock, the co. probably
won’t lose much on those assets.
The capital of £480,000 (as watered) is in 960,000
shares of 10s. each. These are now quoted at 38s. 9d.,
which is a tremendous move from the 11s. 9d. of 10 years
ago. The 38s. 9d. gives the business a market value of
£1,860,000. Taking the freeholds and “ other property ”
to be worth what they are said to be worth in the
balance-sheet, then, as shown above, the co.’s net
possessions are now worth £1,103,307, apart from the
trifle of leaseholds. In the past seven years this total has
been increased by £362,460 ; but in the next eight years
it will have to increase by no less than £740,847 to bring
the assets up to the present market value of the under-
taking. It is quite true that the profits have increased
rapidly during the past few years; but it is doubtful
whether the increase will be wholly maintained. Also it
has to be remembered that the sinking fund is now
£12,000 a year more than it was prior to 1905. For many
years Melbourne Trams have been regarded as a gilt-
edged investment. The time has come, however, when,
owing to the approach of 1916 and all its possibilities,
good and bad, they must be regarded as speculative. On
38s. 9d. per share the increased dividend for last year
shows a return of £5 3s. per cent. ; and that isn’t so large
as to make tip for any doubt that may exist as to the
return of 38s. 9d. per share in 1916.

The reserves consist of an insurance and repairs sus-
pense account (£47,474), and a fund for equalising divi-
dends (£10,028). Into the former fund £3526 has been
dropped during the past six months, while, in order to
make up the usual 8 per cent, dividend, the directors
have had to draw £2511 out of the other fund. Presum-
ing that the £3526 was a fair addition to the fund to pro-
vide for repairs and renewals — i. e., was a fair provision
to cover depreciation—then the profit for the six months
was only enough to pay 5f per cent., instead of 8 per
cent. The term was not normal, though, owing to the
labor trouble in March and April. That was followed by
a further increase in costs, which the co. is countering
with an increase in freights, etc. Industrial condi-
tions on this line are, however, still disturbed.
The co., as pointed out just now, added £3526 to repairs
and renewals fund. That is a net addition—presumably
the co. also paid out of the fund whatever was spent on
repairs, etc., during the term. It is impossible to tell
from the published accounts whether any other profits
are seized upon and applied to write down ship property
direct. The co. has of recent years been constantly buy-
ing and selling vessels; so the variations in the ship-
property item tell nothing, as a rule. Once or twice,
however, the item has been reduced, apparently being
written down out of revenue ; in other words (say) £5OOO
of cash or liquid assets has displaced the same book
value of ship-property. In the absence of a profit
and loss account it can’t be said to what
extent this practice of writing-down is pursued.
The business has increased very much during the last few
years. The ship property item has moved up like this—
June, 1900, £85,745 ; June, 1903, £137,251 ; June, 1908,
£233,362, besides £14,904 paid on account of a new vessel.
For many years, down to 1905, the capital stood at
£131,250; it is now £218,750, in 250,000 shares on which
2s. 6d. is uncalled. The balance of the capital for the
new ships has been raised by the sale of wharf
property (resumed by the State) and the realisation of
other assets. The present balance-sheet, therefore, differs
very much from those of the years previous to, say, 1903 :
and the history of the co. is not much guide to the future.
On the other hand, North Coast settlement has been very
rapid, though the permanence of some of it is still in
doubt. Moreover, rail competition is one of the certain-
ties of the future ; and that is pretty sure to mean that
somewhat less energy will be spent by the State in keep-
ing open some of the alleged “harbors” of the North
Coast.

This is one of the trustee cos. which try to inspire
confidence by telling you nothing about themselves—or
almost nothing. There are some people, no doubt, who
are impressed by the wisdom of the owl; but it is doubt-
ful whether many are sufficiently impressed to say to the
owl, no matter bow silent he may be—“ When lam dead
you shall take my place so far as my business is con-
cerned.” As to the investment value of the shares in this
co., the same thing applies as applies to several other
trustee concerns—one doesn’t know exactly what the
profits are. Trustee cos. draw two lots of commission—
one on the income ; the other on the capital value of the
estate. It is with regard to the latter that all sorts of
different plans are adopted. Some cos., directly an estate
comes in for management, credit themselves with the
commission on the capital value; others spread
out that commission over the years through
which it is expected that the winding up of the estate
will drag ; others take credit for the commission as the
estate is realised —if 20 per cent, of the estate is got rid
of in one year, they pass 20 per cent, of the corpus com-
mission into profits. On account of these varying
methods it is very little use taking any notice of the
profits alleged to have been made by a trustee co. in any
one or two years. This co.’s capital is £25,000 ; and it
has a trifle more than that represented by cash and
public stocks, leaving the reserves to be represented by
the Society’s premises (£15,962) and sundry debts (out-
standing commissions, etc.). In the foregoing table £354,
appropriated as a bonus to the staff, has been deducted
from the past half-year’s revenue. For the past twelve
months the profits show a return of £6 19s. 6d. per cent,
on capital and reserves combined —which is only very
moderate for a trustee co.

That begins to look better ; but if, as alleged, Japanese-
made machinery is now being unloaded in Queensland, it
is quite possible that even the Lyne tariff will have to be
put, up in order to give these Queensland manufacturers
reasonable white-labor Protection. Under the old State
tariff the machinery which this co. makes had mostly a
25 per cent. duty. Then the Ma State Freetrade con-
tingent whittled away at Kingston’s proposals, and only
about half that Protection was secured under the first
Commonwealth tariff. After a great battle, the industry
gets the benefit of a number of 25 per cent, duties, though
there is still an appalling list of exemptions. Never-
theless, the change has given new hope to the co.,
which, under the piebald tariff, was threatened
with almost certain extinction. It is too early even now
to say whether the tariff is sufficient to allow the co. to
make a reasonable six or seven per cent. One great
trouble with nearly all these works is that, on account of
the uncertainty of the future, they can’t command the
means to put in complete, up-to-date plant. If Australia
really means Protection it would pay it handsomely to
express itself definitely—“ Here is 20 N percent. to go on
with. But if the cheap Jap (or somebody else) beats
you on that basis, then you shall have some more.”
If Australia made a definite promise like that, or elected
a Parliament which talked like that, capitalists would
go ahead, works would be brought right up to
date, and very soon costs would be reduced.
But Australia won’t talk like that; and, until it does,
one always must look at the future of these industrial
concerns with a doubt, which is discreditable and damag-
ing to the Commonwealth. Still, as remarked above,
there is hope. The published accounts don’t show' the
extent of the business —wages paid, etc.—but these
figures indicate an improvement :

The increase of the “other debts” is mostly due to the
need to finance apparently larger contracts in hand ; the
estimated value of these, over and above the ‘progress
payments, is included in Cash, etc. The co. could very
well do with more capital ; but it has very' little hope of
getting-it on reasonable terms until Australia says more
plainly that it is going to protect this urg-ently necessary
engineering industry, even if a 100 per cent, duty is
called for.

This private line serves a section of the Riverina, and
connects with the Victorian State system at Moama,
W'hich is across the river from Echuca. The 1903 drought
hit the district hard ; but after that there was a recovery,
and, though things haven’t been too flourishing the last
six or nine months, they have been w'orse in Victoria.
There has consequentlybeen a steady drift of Victorian
farmers into N.S.W., especially into this and other
southern parts. The bulk of the traffic is, however,
pastoral, wherefore it occurs in the second half of the
year—out in the south-w'est the jumbuck is already, in
August, being robbed of his winter overcoat. Confining
the compari -on to the “ off ” seasons, the past half-year’s
figures are the best this century—and for the few' years
also of the last century for which The Bulletin has the
co.’s records. Some details :

In the late ’eighties the co. paid 10 per cent.; then mort-
gages, rabbits and other diseases gradually ate the
dividends down to 5 percent., at which they stood for
some years, until drought dried them up to the 2J per
cent, shown in the table. With closer settlement the
prospects of the co. steadily improve ; and the dividend
prospects also improve on account of the steady reduc-
tion of the debenture debt. In 1902 it was £30,000 ; it is
now back to £23,500, and the half-yearly interest pay-
ment has melted down from £6OO to £440. No expendi-
ture has been charged up to capital account for many
years ; all renewals' together with additions, if any, to
stock, plant, etc., have been paid out of revenue. There
are 25,000 £5 shares paid to £4.

This co. didn’t get a good start. It was born in 1891, and
the next few years were very severe on financial infants,
and especially on infants which expected to live
largely on sheep. After two or three years it
managed to pay a dividend, but it was only
able to repeat the performance twice afterwards.
It laid itself out to freeze and export meat, and mort-
gaged itself to provide the accommodation and the means
to carry on the trade, and then it found that the big
drought hadn’t left it any work to do. While things
W'ere slowly mending in that respect, it built up a wool
business ; and, though 1902-3 were a severe set-back, it
managed to pull through, and hold itself ready for the
very big increase in the frozen meat business which has
come with the last four good years. In three years past
it has handled about a million sheep for export, 316,732 of
them during the past 12 months. What the effect of that
has been on the local price of meat nobody can tell for
certain ; but it probably amounts to two or three
shillings a head on the average—that is to say, Sydney
meat-eaters would pay N. S. Wales meat-growers two or
three shillings less per head of sheep if it were not for
the onerations of this co. The Sydney meat-eater and
the N.S.W. meat-grow'er are therefore very liable to
regard this co. with different feelings. Digging further
into the published accounts, these comparisons can be
got:—

The profits have been used to reduce the mortgage and
debenture debt. The principal of the freeholds is the big
store that stands alongside Admiralty House, in a place
where no sheep-store should be. It is probable that
undisclosed profits have been used to write down some of
the assets; a few years ago it was said that £7500 had
been applied to this purpose, and the profit and loss
account lumps the profit “after providing for. . .'bad
and doubtful debts and depreciation.” The balance-sheet
still shows a goodwill item, £24,516, which ought to be
written off, and which probably will be now that at last
the reserves on the other side exceed that amount. In
the table at the top of this, that item has of course not
been reckoned as an asset.

This co. has a stiff competitor in the suppliers of electric
lifts, and it makes very little progress in the matter of
either gross revenue or net profits. For the half-year to
June, 1903, the gross revenue was £12,501 ; June, 1907,
£12,461; June, 1908, £12,294. Meantime, in five years
the wages, general charges, etc., have crept up from £5916
to £6166. In its published accounts theco. shows reserves
amounting to £26,685 after providing for the dividend.
But on the other side there is a paper or goodwill item,
“ Parliamentary rights and concessions, £15,000.” Even
the remaining: £11,685 is not the best of reserves, because all
the plant, property (including leasehold), etc., are in at
cost; consequently a part of the reserves at any rate re-
presents actual depreciation. For the same reason the
profits are no doubt over-stated, since nothing is deducted
from them to provide for the renewals which will become
necessary by-and-bye. Current renewals are probably
being paid for and charged up to working expenses ; but
current revenue will not cover the big - renewals of
plant, etc. The additions to the reserves are being put
into plant; but they' are not bringing in anything extra.
Five years ago the fixed investment (mains, freeholds,
etc.) cost £101,745, and the gross revenue was £12,501;
the item has now grown to £111,247, yet the gross
revenue is still no more than £12,294. The co.’s Parlia-
mentary Bill provides that any - divisible profits over 10
per cent, shall be cut up equally between the co. and the
City Council. Possibly this may explain why the gross
revenue does not grow—the co. may prefer to make con-
cessions in order to assure its connection rather than
imperil the connection by making extra profits, of which
it would only get one-half. But there is no proof of that
in the published figures.

This co. is the offspring of the Sydney and Suburban
Hydraulic Power Co. ; and, though the City Council
started out to dispute it at one time, apparently the pro-
vision limiting the parent’s dividends to 10 percent.,
unless the council shares in the excess, does not apply to
the child. Anyhow, the council did not pursue the claim.
The reserves have been put back into the business ; but
there is no hint as to whether they have to cover depreci-
ation, or whether depreciation is allowed for out of undis-
closed profits. The capital is in 30,000 shares of £l, paid
to 15s. The business depends to a considerable extent on
the Hydraulic Power Co. ; and if the latter had more
trouble to earn its 10 per cent., it might occasionally
drive a harder bargain with the subsidiary co. That
remains one of the possibilities ahead of this co.

The advances made by this highly-respectable old Uncle
Monty are an interesting study. At the middle of 1901
things were about normal, and the advances totalled
£73,450. By the end of droughty 1903 things were bad ;
so Monty had lent his nephews £88,400. Then followed
some years of boom and of cheap money, and by June,
1907, only £80,428 was outstanding. Just then acci-
dents began to happen. The wretched share market, in
which it hadn’t seemed possible to go wrong for 18
months, turned dog on its trustful punters. Time bar-
gains began to be oppressive. And then the punters had
to remember their old relative once more. So the advances
have proceeded like this : June, 1907, £80,428 ; Dec., 1907,
£84,839 ; June, 1908, £93,170. The co. used to accept
deposits; but apparently it found that an overdraft is
handier, and to oblige the new rush of customers a small
credit balance has been turned in the six months into a
debit of £BO4O. Of the reserves £3102 is a fund to allow for
shrinkage of assets ; and with over £93,000 lent on a
tremendous variety of securities, there must be amaz-
ingly good management if there isn’t an occasional over-
valuation. Therein lies the biggest risk from the invest-
ment point of view. One can’t check the value of the
assets in any way ; yet if it should turn out that they
have been overvalued, then of course the profits have
been overstated. Still it doesn’t seem in this case a very
grave risk, because in the five and a half years since the
10 per cent. divs. have been paid, £12,134 has been added
to the reserves ; and that allows a comfortable margin
for quite a lot of unsuspected moth and rust and decay'.
The co. is in 75,000 shares of £l, 50,000 of them fully
paid, and 25,000 paid to 10s. ; but on many of the latter
lot calls have been pre-paid.

This co. got into the habit of paying big dividends, and
knocks it off with great difficulty. In the early ’nineties
it was paying 17 and 18 per cent. ; then, step by' step,
it was driven back to 12 per cent, in 1896; and
it is now becoming impossible to justify that much.
Things would not look so bad if the co. were writing
down its mains and other works ; but apparently not a
penny is going that way. Certainly the co. is paying for
repairs out of revenue ; but that doesn’t cover general
wear and tear. Provision ought to be made for the bigger
renewals ; and that isn’t being done. Bendigo isn’t on
the up-grade either; so if this co. is managed with the
average amount of Bendigo prudence, a reduction in the
dividend is one of the things that the share-
holder needn’t be surprised to meet at any time.
So far as one can see at present, only two things can stop
the reduction—a great improvement in the Bendigo out-
look (and there is no sign of that) or a very' substantial
reduction in the cost of coal (and there are not very
strong indications of that either). As to the latter item,
£5452 of gas-money three years ago cost £1695 for coal;

A water famine at Broken Hill has time and
again been predicted, but even .were the Stephens Creek
Reservoir to run dry, some of the companies would he
able to keep portion'of;the works running by using the

is now intent on taking the same precautions, and has
ordered from W. & J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, an Aldrich
Quintuplex Pump, which ■will be placed at the 1000 ft.

before it would he fit for human consumption. Is the

One of the things that are liable to happen to
an insurance office under the present system of piecemeal
State legislation is happening just now to the Citizens’. In
the revenue account which it issues with its annual report
it puts receipts under six headings, lumping commissions
and management exes in one line and surrenders and
bonuses in another. Everybody who reads the report
knows how much is paid in bonuses and how much in
surrenders ; also how much of the bonuses goes to policy-
holders (four-fifths) and how much to shareholders (one-
fifth). The Bulletin, in fact, in post-morteming the
annual report, always adds the shareholders’ bonus to the
costs of management in order to show the expense rate.
Under the Vic. Companies Act the co. has to send in a
return according to a prescribed form ; so surrenders have
to be shown distinct from bonus. It is simply a difference
in grouping : there are no figures in the Victorian return
(except the proportion of commission and management
expenses) that couldn’t be easily ascertained from the
report issued in N. S. Wales ; yet because the two forms
differ, the office is being jumped on with tremendous
energy and accused of issuing a misleading document,
and the two documents are put side by side to show that
both can’t be right. Yet, of course, they ban be, and in
fact are.
At the half-yearly meeting of the Adelaide
Steam Tug Co. (B. 6/8/’08) it was decided to pay a bonus of
£2BOO (5 per cent.) in addition to the ordinary dividend at
the rate of 10 per cent. The total distribution for the
half-year was therefore £5600 (at the rate of 20 per cent,
per annum), leaving the reserves at £15,668. The extra
bonus was paid out of the insurance fund, which the
directors reported had grown larger than was necessary
for their purpose.
« * * *
Broken Hill South issues the expected cheerless
report. The net profit for the half-year was £15,497, in-
cluding £lO,OOO from zinc tailings—a shocking slump
from the £94,000 net which the co. made in the corres-
ponding half of 1907. That, of course, was during the
metal boom. Twelve months ago, trying to drive home
the fact that there was a boom in progress, and that
profits were therefore inflated and weren’t safe things to
look at, The Bulletin pointed out that, with lead at £l3
and silver at 2s. 6d., the co.’s profits on the half-year’s
output would have been only £13,529. It looked an
absurd figure in those days, no doubt; and yet it was a
bit over the mark, judging' by the past half-year’s work.
* * * *
Apart from lead-market considerations, and if
appearances are not deceptive, the Broken Hill Junction
North has passed through its darkest hour. The long
and expensive struggle with the mill seems to be at an
end ; and if the shaft only holds out, there is now no
reason why a good tonnage of ore should not be main-
tained. The No. 10 level never looked better than it does
at present,’and at the bottom level a fine body of ore is
being opened up. A rhodonite bar, which caused some
anxiety when the level was first worked, has now been
found to have a fine body of ore riding over it. From the
bottom level the ore body is going down with a strong
western underlay, and partly on that account it is
probable that the shaft will be deepened and another
level opened up. Additional tables are also to be placed
in the mill, and various other improvements of an enter-
prising character are engaging attention.
An attempt has been made by the Junction
North to lay hands on the derelict Broken Hill Junction,
but the shareholders sniffed disdainfully at the first
bait offered—2o,ooo shares in a co. of 200,000. And yet
they might do worse. As a mining proposition, the
Junction North could not be expected to seriously con-
sider its neighbor just now, although there is a good deal
of ore in the north end of the Junction which could be
economically dealt with through the Junction North
shaft. Leaving mining out of the question, the water in
tbe mine, is an asset, and in suggesting a deal the Junction
North no doubt had that fact in view.
* » * *
While it is quietly chewing over the Junction
North’s offer to absorb it, the Junction is going through
with its reconstruction scheme. Adelaide and Broken Hill
shareholders compromised, and so settled their quarrel;
the first payment is to be sixpence per share, as Adelaide
wanted, and subsequent payments are to be 3d. every
other month, as Broken Hill wanted. And finally (though
that probably won’t help much) Broken Hill is to have a
local director or two. The co. still has about £2600 in
hand, and claims to have 149,000 tons of ore in sight ; but
it is hard to get at, and most of it is bad to treat after it
is got.
* * * *
A very little moisture gave an impetus to the
continuous movement in the Sulphide Corporation’s
Central mine, Broken Hill; or, at any rate, the impetus
arrived at the same time as the moisture. The special
movement amounted to nothing serious, but serves as a
reminder that the stated ore reserves in both Central and
Block 10, next door, ought to be heavily discounted, as it
is extremely unlikely that it will ever be possible to get
out anything like all the ore in those mines.
* * * *
Later developments at the new bottom level of
the Harden (N.S.W.) are much better. A little driving
has been done both east and west on the ore ; and
though in the drive east the stuff was still poor (10s. per
ton), westward the face is in ore 2ft. wide, worth 158 s.
per ton. A pump is now being put in at this level ; and
till the lode is drained a little, other work there is hung
up. Meantime the plant, working on the ore from the
upper levels, makes a steady profit of about £l5OO a
month—last month’s total was £1505, after paying all
development costs.
* * * *
Kyloe (N.S.W.), which was over-capitalised
already, having had to pass through too many hands in
the voyage from the prospector to the public, has been
obliged to issue 20,000 pref. shares. Under ordinary circum-
stances a copper mine with a small and not very regular vein
wouldn’t have much hope of raising capital just now ;
but Kyloe developments have been satisfactory, and
Adelaide, which holds most of the mine, readily took the
pref. issue.
■*•#*■*
Shareholders in Cobar Gold Mines (the old
Fort Bourke) must be beginning to feel uncomfortable.
At the close of the financial year 1904 (September 30) it
was reported that the reserves of free-milling ore were
about exhausted ; but after that a little of the same stuff
was found below 216 ft. level, and so crushing on a reduced
scale was continued for a while. At September, 1904,
the actual cash in hand was £63,365, and the other liquid
assets four or five thousand in excess of liabilities. That
was regarded as a fund to provide plant to treat the sul-
phide ore ; and shareholders, who had never got a divi-
dend, were told that the sulphide ore really constituted
the mine. Between 216 ft. and 316 ft. Chairman M'Donaid
reported in 1905 that there were 262,000 tons of ore available,
about half of it low-grade. Since then the co. has had in-
numerable reports made, and practically nothing else has
been done, except that a little experimental Elmore plant
has been put up. Yet the cash had been sweated down to
£45,864 by the end of September, 1907, and the sweating'
process has, no doubt, been pretty severe during the past
nine months. In London both the Elmore and the
Cattermole oil processes have been tested, and, as a result,
Johnson and Sons, the well-known metallurgists, recom-
mended an oil process ; that was on July 16, 1907. That
recommendation has been carried out, and the result has
been poor ; whether the Elmore process or the preliminary
crushing is at fault is a matter of opinion. Praotically,
therefore, the co. isn’t any more advanced than it was
four years ago, notwithstanding that meantime over
£20,000 of cash and liquid assets have gone; and the
prospects of providing a sufficient plant with the pro-
ceeds of the oxidised ore are becoming bluer. It is
another example of the conspicuous failure of the Eng-
lish management of Australian mines.
J, O. Armstrong and Dr. Jack, of course, report
that Lloyd’s (N.S. W.) is good enough to put more money
into. They put the ore blocked out at 120,000 tons,
worth 4 per cent, copper ; and, though that is a good bit
to go on with, they recommend first the pushing out of
three levels further east (Nos. 3, 7 and 10), those being
now beyond the last fault. If the result is good, as they
expect (and as managing director Corbould has always
expected) it will be, then the plant must be remodelled
and £20,000 spent on a tramway to bring in firewood.
This last was really the snag against which the mine
pulled up. Assuming the eastern exploration is satisfac-
tory, the mine will call for £46,400 of new capital: £lO,OOO
to put out the three trial drives and then develop the
mine down to the No. 13, £20,000 for the tramway, and
£16,400 for the removal and rearrangement of the plant.
With that done they figure on putting copper F. 0.8.
Sydney at £46 per ton.
Sydney shareholders have renewed hopes of Mt.
David (N.S. W.), as the last crushing of 460 tons returned
2760 z. and 530 z. from concentrates. After paying reali-
sation charges on the latter, the return should equal
from £2 10s. to £2 15s. per ton. The Huntingdon mill
only added 12oz. to the yield, which seems to spell disap-
pointment, but the object was to quarry and treat a lot of
low grade material at the lowest possible cost, so poor re-
turns from this section of the plant are to be expected. In
extending No. 2 level of the winch winze the mine is
developing a new make of payable stone. The new shaft,
when down to the required depth, will have a better
chance of opening- up the mine and increasing the output.
The small output of considerably under 6000 tons a year
is at present the stumbling block from an investor’s point
of view. On such a limited tonnage a continuous run on
good stone is required to pay even a modest sixpenny
dividend in 12 months. Expenses are not likely to be
reduced for a time.
> * *
Hillgrove (N.S. W.) is suffering dull times again.
Scheelite and antimony are too low to give much em-
ployment, and the New Hillgrove Prop, has had to take
a pull On its heavy capital expenditure. The recent
“ burst” in No. 17, Baker’s Creek, and the lower grade of
ore treated also help the glum feeling. With the New Hill-
grove Prop, the difficulty all along has been to make
small mine resources stretch to the absurd length of the
share register, and the debt of £21,000 will only tend to
aggravate this difficulty. Baker’s Creek has a bit of
money in the bank, and is thus in a better position than
the big English concern. Long crosscuts have, however,
to be put out from the shaft in order to open up every
new level. Still, these help to insure the workings, which
will soon reach 2000 ft., from serious disaster through
“ bursts.”

Kinsella (W.A.) has been sampled by the Fin-
gall Co., and found wanting. Local papers say that pro-
specting at depth is to be undertaken ; but that is only
hearsay. The property was bought to provide a needful
source of water supply for the Fingall, and will probably
never be used for anything else.
* * * *
London Statist, of June 27, gave the Whim
Well crowd (W.A.) a bad time, and other British papers
are joining in the hunt. Mendacious newspaper puffing,
the fact of £47 per ton of copper produced being re-
quired to make ends meet, irrespective of London admin-
istration, interest on floating debt, etc., and finally the
absurdity of the inspired hint that a dividend is coming
along-, are dealt with. Then attention is drawn to the
promotion of the co. But at that point the directors
became annoyed, and are talking law.
* * * *
The Northern Mines, at Lawlers (W.A.), now
treats nearly 9000 tons a month, at a total cost of 14s. 3d,
per ton, and this despite over 500 miles of railage, nearly
100 miles of cartage (this puts up the cost of supplies),
and seven miles of ore-trucking to the mill. Only up-to-
date plant and the expenditure of capital running into
more than six figures enable the co. to do this ; but the
achievement is agood one, all the same.
* * * *
Vivien (W.A.) just manages to keep a little
ahead of it on ore worth about 7dwt. The report for 1907
shows that the year’s working resulted in a profit of
£ll3, which, with £733 brought forward, made a total of
£847. The main feature of the development work during
the period was the extension and connection of the No. 2
and 3 levels. A new slimes plant is now at work and
helping to swell the monthly return. Ore reserves are
two years ahead of the mill, but dividends are not yet
visible.

Chaffers (W.A.) lately had a set-back, partly
because it has thrown up the copper show which it was
testing in the Nor’-West; and people begin to suspect
that most of its resources will be frittered away, with
nothing to show for them. This Nor’-West claim had an
outcrop which assayed up to 42 per cent, copper; but
there wasn’t enough of it to be worth bothering about.
Meantime, two tribute parties are developing the new
lode in the old Chaffers property, and the development
is very satisfactory. Two loz. crushings have been
taken out, and there is a good body of 26dwt. ore in one
face. The 500,000 shares in the co. are, however, a
tremendous swag to carry.

The Atlas Petroleum Co. has issued a pros-
pectus in Westralia. The promoters propose to form a
co. with 22,500 £1 shares, half of which are contributing,
to bore for petroleum somewhere between Bunbury and
Cape Leeuwin. The old yarn about “ large quantities of
asphaltum being thrown up on the adjacent beach” is
revived ; much space is absorbed by figures showing the
world’s past production of oil, and an extended reference
is made to the drill-hole put down to a depth of 1710 ft.
at Warren River some time ago, and which,
according to the prospectus, “ proved incontestably
that a petroleum horizon had already been cut
and opened up by erosive action of the river.”
Seeing, however, that the asphaltum may have
come from anywhere, and that the petroleum produced
to date in other countries is neither here nor there, and
that the bore alluded to only passed through common
sea-sand, it is hard to understand what the authors are
driving' at. The scheme is not one to be treated seriously.

It is the hand of managing-director P. W.
Tewksbury that signs the first report of the Tewksbury
Amalgamated, but it is the voice of J. C. Watson, one of
his two co-directors, that sounds through it. One isn’t
at all surprised, then, to find that this directors’ report,
with the voice of the ex-Labor leader in it, isn’t quite
like most other directors’ reports. One
frank and honest paragraph is devoted to redemption of
capital. “The mine and plant, which principally repre-
sent shareholders’ capital . . . continually depreciate in
value as worked. It is, therefore, evident that part of
the gold won by that work, to at least the amount which
the assets have depreciated in value, also repre-
sents the capital invested. ... It is therefore pro-
posed henceforward to ear-mark one-third of the
amount distributed to shareholders as redemption of
capital, and the balance will be paid as dividends.” This
plan can be followed with a dredging proposition, for,
though there are risks, still, given proper prospecting,
the future can be fairly well foretold. It won’t make a
bit of difference in the amount to reach the shareholders’
pockets, but it will be a constant reminder that the more
they get the less there is left, and the longer they work
the nearer they get to the time when their claim will be
no more than a mud heap. And that ought to stop the
punter from paying an absurd price for shares later on,
when the mud-heap stage has been very nearly reached.

The Tewksbury Amalgamated, which is a con-
solidation of several small Bright (Vic.) dredging pro-
perties, is working five dredges, from which it gathered
up last half-year £10,277 profit. That, however, was
before writing off depreciation. This was on a capital of
£66,500. gome remarkably cheap work has been done ;
the old Tewksbury Freehold No. 2 dredge’s working
expenses were only 1'435d. per cubic yard, or £5 I9s. 7d.
per 1000 cubic yards. Other dredges worked by this co.
are those of the old Tewksbury, Eurobin, and Freeburgh
cos. On the results so far and the prospecting, the direc-
tors reckon to pay back capital and something like
£130,000 besides.

Vic. dredging and sluicing claims are bustling ;
the recent rains in the N.E. have filled the dams and
started the creeks running. Donald Fletcher has applied
for a lease on the Yackandandah Creek, at the junction
with Clear Creek. But Pearson Tewksbury’s application
for 2000 acres on the Ovens River below Wangaratta is
making most stir. If this is granted it will be the first
plant to work so low down the river. But the farmers
are getting ready to say a word or two to the warden.
The Kiewa River leases have not yet been granted ;
Warden Rowan is to visit the ground and give a decision
shortly. The landholders are kicking hard.

Two lights of the Melbourne Stock Exchange
journeyed to the Insolvency Court last week to testify
that the practice of the members of that Exchange was
not to spec shares to clients. They were not called,
otherwise cross-examination might have disclosed that
they could not testify very much from their own
personal knowledge as to what is done. Whether
the practice comes within the category of the
“dishonorable conduct” included in the Stock Ex.
rules as a reason for expulsion, may depend on
how the dealing works out. If the specker can deliver, no
one suffers, provided he can pay his difference should the
market go the wrong way. If it does not, and he becomes
unfinancial, the dishonorable conduct rule does not mate-
rially affect the position, because the defaulter is shunted
anyway,

Mackay’s Quartz, Gaffney’s (Vie.), carries the
usual sixpenny worth of froth. It isn’t named after one
Mackay, the legal manager, in whose office it is, but is
fathered by some hoary-headed prospector who punched
it well, and then left. The co. has indulged in theluxury
of a 6in. winch, a modest overdraft, and a long tunnel.
Now it wants a lode. When that is got it will want a fair
shoot of stone, and then it will meet the wants of some of
the knowing ones, who require a neat market for a hungry
mob of speckers.
*■ * * *■
Melbourne is told that it has hit a three-star
mine in the Diamond Creek, about nine miles from
Heidelberg. The show is an old-timer, with a still older
dyke to work, carrying a vein of quartz alongside. The
Argus lately alleged that there wasn’t a dead-end show-
ing. That may be true; but is there a decent
reserve of stone? No. 2 level north carried
13 inches of stone ; there is Bin. of the same
stuff south, while a reef where cut at 525 ft. is also
Bin. The average of gold is nearly 30dwt. Costs are
relatively high with such a narrow formation ; and six
months’ hard work would tear out most of the quartz
proved. The co. doesn’t do things that way, though.
It clings to a five-head battery, and runs through only
200 tons a month. Shareholders aren’t greedy, as while
they took £2625 for divs., they put £lOOO aside for emer-
gencies. A little more of this and a little more good
stone, and they will deserve a niche as mining saints.
* * * *
Golden Dyke, Wandong (Vic.), pops out a
balance-sheet at six-monthly intervals to show that it
pays directors’ fees, and has credit enough to get a bank
overdraft. What ties it up is the hunt after quartz, the
shortness of the shoots when got, and the heavy per-
centage of antimony. Directors say “the whole of the
machinery is in good working order.” If that is their
best, it is time the happy despatch was thought about.
* * * «
The Mitchell River Antimony Co. (N.Q.), which
was going to demonstrate a new caustic soda process for
the extraction of gold and antimony, is up against the
hard, cold fact that its money is exhausted, though the
process hasn’t been given even an hour’s test. The
McArthurs, of Glasgow, fathered the process, and were
heavily interested in Mitchell River; and they sent
out metallurgist Opie to give the thing a start. So' that
there shouldn’t be any friction, the co. also appointed
McArthurs’ representative as general manager. He did
some mining work, wasn’t satisfied with the results, and
left just when the Board expected the test to be made.
To get the plant on the ground and do the little prospect-
ing work, that has been done has cost close up to £20,000;
and, though the developments may not show as much
ore as looked probable from surface indications, there
was enough anyhow to test the process on. The two
Munros and other substantial North Queenslanders are
deep in the business, so it is safe to say that, now that
the thing has got this far, funds will be available to
take it the necessaiy few steps further.

The conditions under which the Gympie (Q)
Prospecting Association is to qualify for its slice of the
£50,000 Government grant are briefly these : The Govern-
ment undertakes to pay for six months the wages of 25
men at 255. per week, and a superintendent at £4, to
prospect places approved by the Committee and sanc-
tioned by the Government Geologist. No lease is to ex-
ceed five acres. In the event of any holding proving
sufficiently valuable to pay current wages and other
working expenses, Government assistance is to cease; also
titles to the land will be withheld until an agreement has
been signed by the Association undertaking to refund all
money advanced before any distribution of profits takes
place. The Association is a fairly strong body, repre-
sented by the warden and local inspector of mines, two
members each from the Miners’ Union and Mine Owners’
Association, and the chairman of the Gympie Chamber of
Commerce. Croydon is to be the next field dealt with in
the same way, and the State Geologist has just finished
an inspection.
* * * *
At the end of 50 years’ gold-mining, the output
of Queensland amounts to 15,611,7670 z., of which Charters
Towers has contributed 5,647,9380 z.. Gympie 2,375,3040 z.,
Rockhampton and Mt. Morgan 3,266,4990 z., and the
Palmer 1,323,7350 z. It is remarkable that a field which
has produced over a million ounces has been so neglected
as the Palmer has been.

W.R. : Hunt-street, Wrightville, N.S.W
R.D.T.: Can only refer you to the last notice of the
association in Bulletin of Sept. 26 last.
Mine-inspector Deeble’s annual report on the
Kalgoorlie field draws attention to the curious fact that,
though cos. frequently report that they lose practically
nothing- in the tailings, yet several of the mines are
installing retreatment plants to handle these tailings. The
inspector also points out that the competition among
managers to show low figures as to costs per ton may at
times operate against the interests of shareholders. The
extraction of the last dwt. of gold, worth 45., sometimes
costs an extra 3s. per ton, so there is a strong temptation
for the manager to let the shilling profit go rather than
show costs 3s. per ton higher than those of his neighbors.
And there is a lot of truth in this.

“ Agricola” : Be “Gundy ” and foxes (B.
16/7/’08). His statement that the lady fox evi-
dences great cunning in concealing her young
shows that the said “Gundy” infests apart of
the country where the fox is still a novelty In
the Gundagai district (N.S.W.), where thousands
of foxes are slain, murdered, and assassinated
annually, it is the easiest thing out to discover the
cubs. Mostly the lying-in establishment con-
sists of a hollow log, surrounded by an ancient
and unattractive odor. Even before the cubs
are able to go out prospecting for themselves, a
well-defined pad may be seen leading to the door
of the Maternity Home. On the mat are de-
posited legs, heads, and other indigestible frag-
ments of bunnies, making it rather a conspicuous
place to both nose and eye. With a dog trained
to the work, scores of the cubs may be
captured with little trouble during August
and the two following months. In the
Batlow district (N.S.W.), a couple of years ago,
one man scored 98 cubs in a fortnight. He de-
pended on a fox-terrier to guide him to the
nursery, and then excavated them with his axe.
At that time the P. P. Board was giving a bonus
of Is. per scalp for fox cubs, but since that was
discontinued the infant mortality has slumped.

“Percatates” writes
Permit me to have a “ cast ” or two at“H.G.,” who
talks wild bosh (B. 23/7/’08) concerning trout. In the
at cf tit e ’ t * le Sno 'YJ r P'> ver —the old-man trout stream of
Iv.S.W. has no native edible fish aboye the big falls near
Paupong ; and never had, unless we except the tiny in-
digenous mountain trout (so-called) and minnows, of the
sort found in the Blue Lake a-top of Kosciusko. In such
Monaro and other streams as already had indigenous fish
(bream and the like), and to which trout have been intro-
duced, there has been -no diminution of the indigenous
fish owing to trout ravages. The boot is on the other leg.
ouch ravaging as has occurred must be placed to the
credit of a local product—the perch. Trout have failed
hitherto in every eastern stream where perch were, the
latter being voracious eaters of trout fry. Trout, cod
and perch all live and have their being in different parts
of the ’Bidgee River, but generally they keep apart.
Trout cannot live for any length of time in the tepid
water the perch loves. When the trout becomes full-grown
he often wanders,into the domain of the perch and cod,
and remains uninjured for a while. At Bombalong, near
Michelago, I have caught trout up to the time of
the arrival of a thunderstorm ; then they “ went off the
rise. I changed the tackle, shifted to deep water, and
caught seven perch during the time that hail fell.
Generally speaking, the trout keep to the rough, cold
upper waters, which the cod and perch abhor.
There is nothing to show that Salmo Iridens, of Long
Plain and Brindabella, ever ate the family of portly old
Oligorus Macquariensis, who lives from Queanbeyan to
the sea, or harassed Mrs. Terapon and her fry, the silver
perch, of western waters. I would like to ‘know from
H.G. why are there nob “ tons ** of such native fish in
the waters where trout are not? The Upper Queanbeyan
and Badg-a (both Big- and Little) are full of trout; the
lower waters hold a few cod. But there is nothing like
the number there was in the old days. The sole reason for
the cod’s infrequency is the fact that thev aren’t pro-
tected. God are shot and netted bv cookies along the
river banks, regardless of seasons. Trout flourish because
it has been made an offence to treat them so. The
Fisheries Board is now rearing fry of cod and perch for
stocking suitable waters, and they are to be protected
reasonably. If “ H.G.” knew the elements of his subject
he would realise that it is lack of proper attention from
dynamiting vandals, and not the presence of trout—a
harmless fish in regard to other fish at the worst—which
has depleted N.S. W. streams of native fish.
“ Henry Phelthatt ” : lam glad “ Goril ”
dropped something pretty convincing on to
“ Maorilander.” That doubting individual must
have got his swine into the same obese condition
as the footballer he recently exported—so hog fat
that they wallow helplessly in their own lard, and
then knock up at the first opportunity. All wild
hogs aren’t that way—not by a heap. I pursued
the pork-beast once. I was mounted on an experi-
enced old piebald swine-chaser. We drew cover
in a thick pine scrub. My steed switched his tail
and propped his ears at the first dog-note. Next
second we were moving. To borrow from
.Nazzaro : “ The universe went roaring past, and
all I had to do was to keep the machine’s head
right,” hold tight, dodge the universe, and keep
in sight of the pig. He had about 25
lengths’ start of me at the outset. At
the end of a very fast mile I had reduced it to
15 lengths. The piebald never slackened, neither
did the pig. The excitement became intense.
Both were within striking distance, especially
the pig. I urged my black and white to his
utmost, nor stopped to look round until I had
put about five lengths (Bogan pig lengths) between
us. At 2} miles' I had not drawn any closer to
him, neither had I got much further away from
him, and the horse, the hog and the universe
were all roaring together. The pig was rolling
badly ; so was the piebald, when the welcome
sound of hoof-beats smote my ears. The desire to
abandon the chase suddenly became mutual.
The boar escaped in the thick lignum bush, and-
my steed and his rider had perforce to “ give him
best.” The rest of the party told me, and. I quite
believed it, that I had taken after the wrong
hog. All I’m sorry for is that it wasn’t “ Kauri-
lander ” and not me.

“Elmore”: Am as well aware as “The

bristles, which “The Prooshan ” will appreciate
when his sense of humor sprouts again. But
womby’s rind is no fraud whatever his gall may
be. First struck wombat’s coat being utilised (in
the green state) by prospectors in NvE. Vic.,
back of Bogong high plains. Oil drums were out
of thequestion there then, and the men were hauling
stone up 60ft. with wombats’ skins sewn together.
They reckoned them indestructible. As mats
have often struck them. One in particular (home
tanned) has covered the step on the side door of a
Sunday-biz pub I know for seven years, and it is
still as good as new. This pub is in a busy mining
town, and the hobnails of a few hundred miners
will test anything. A stockman of my acquaint-
ance tanned several woms.’ under-vests with alum
and saltpetre, and got his saddles seated with
them. “ They’ll never wear out,” he says. As
for skinning, I’d sooner do one dozen wombats
than start on a hog. Yes, there’s much silver for
the man-who goes in for wombat peel.

This is the true story of a scrap that didn’t.
They thought they had a champion at Redcat.
He was a fourteen-stoner, and his name was
Dooley. He made his bread honestly, plucking
up gumtrees by the roots, and carrying them down
to the sawmill by the river, one under each arm,
and he had whipped every man in the district
who thought he could fight. It occurred to Craig,
the publican, that a bit of money might be picked
up by promoting a scrap between Dooley and a S
professional heavyweight from Melbourne or
bydney. A heavyweight with a fair newspaper
reputation was secured, and the great mill was
advertised for show week. Craig was a
whale for advertisement, and it was he
who invented, organised, and stage-
managed the idea of a quarrel and a pre-
liminary bout in his bar. The publican
had risked about £3O in the enter-
prise, and wanted to keep up the popular
excitement, and it seemed to him that the
preliminary battle would occasion talk,
excite interest, and spread faith in the
genuineness of the coming encounter.
The battle in the bar was wisely thought
out and well worked up. Dooley was to
say something insulting to Dodger Walsh
(his opponent from town), and Dodger was
to hurl his temperance drink in Dooley’s
whiskers. Then Dooley was to get atWalsh,
and wallow all over him. Of course each
understood it was merely theatrical display, and
they were to be torn apart before mortal injuries
were inflicted. It worked beautifully up to a
point. Craig took care to have a great crowd in
his bar. The editor of the Red eat Banner was
present. Dooley called Dodger a person without
a father, Dodger threw his ginger-beer over
Dooley, and Dooley went at Dodger like a mob of
frantic cattle. It was at this point that Dooley’s
zeal outran discretion. He didn’t forget instruc-
tions, but in the fervor of the moment he over-
acted his part, and the bash he landed on Dodger
hurled that hapless pugilist into the next room,
clean through a pine partition. When the date
of the fight came round, Dodger was still in the
accident ward. He was a month in bed, and
Craig had to pay all exes. All Dooley said, as he
looked ruefully at the hospital containing his in-
capacitated opponent was: “Fancy him talcin’ it
like that! ”
“ Edyson ” : Mrs. Crowe, widow of the
lamented Tom Crowe, of Tin Hills (Vic.), issaid to be
about to take action for the recovery of substantial
damages from Walter Horace, settler, of the
same district, for breach of promise of mar-
riage. It appears that Mr. Horace admits the
promise and stands to the breach, but pleads
extenuating circumstances. The plea is put
in his own graphic language. “I’ve
knowed Mrs. Crowe was after me ever
since Tom pegged out, ’n’ I’ve done me
best t’ dodge her, but she was that
persistent I was often thinkin’ of
sellin’ out account iv her intentions,
but I couldn’t git no offer fer th’
selection, all th’ married men havin’

I’d gone t’ me billy t’ get

brought down th’ stick un-

grip was that
tight I hadn’t

in me. I was
there fer half
a day afore I
was found, ’n’
then it was Mrs.
• Crowe found
me. She didn’t
start off for ’elp at
once, but stood loolc-
in’ at me in a curious, speculative sort o’ way.
‘Fer God’s sake,’ I sez, ‘get me out 6’ this!’
* P’raps,’sez she. ‘Whatd’yer mean by “p’raps”?’
I sez. ‘Will veh marry me if I get yeh out,
Wally Horace ?’ she sez, straight. ‘No,’ I yells,
‘ I’ll see yeh ’anged first! ’ ‘ Then, good day t’
yeh, Mr. Horace,’ sez she. She come back about
sundown, when I was feelin’ near dead. ‘ How is
it now, Wally, my poor man?’sez she. ‘Will you
marry me now? ’ ‘I won’t,’ sez I. She said how
she thought it would be a wet, cold night, ’n’went
away. Just afore midnight she gave me
another look up. ‘ Will yeh marry me,
W.ally Horace ? ’ she sez. I felt that another hour
ud be th’ death o’ me, but I hung on. ‘Never,
never will I marry yeh. Mother Crowe,’ sez I.
She went off agen, ’n’ I saw nothin’ of her till ten
next mornin’. It was hellish hot, ’n’ th’ ants was
gettin’ at me. I was fair beat, ’n’ mad fer water.
Good mornin’, Wally,’ she sez, sweet’n’ cool;
‘ how d’ yeh feel about marriage this mornin’?’
‘Give me a drink!’ I sez. ‘Speakin’ iv mar-
riage ? ’ sez she. ‘ I’ll marry yeh !’ I gasped—l
was desperate. ‘ I’ll marry yeh—l will, s’elp
me!’ She made me write it on a bit o’ paper
with a pencil, 'n’ then she went fer Myall and
Tincliff, ’n’ I was cut out ’n’ sent t’ th’ ’orspital.
Now she wants me t’ stick t’ me promise, but th’
lawyer sez promises obtained under undoo pres-
sure don’t hold good, ’n’ if er five-ton gum butt
on top of a bloke ain’t undoo pressure, I give it
up, that’s all.”

SHADOW OF DEATH HOTEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out on the Back Plains hot and dry,
Out where the mirage gleams,
Out where the red remorseless sky
A crimson ribbon seems.
Old and roomy it stands alone,
Looking across the plain—
Half-way house to the Great Unknown
From the cities of Greed and Gain.
All its windows ablaze with light
(Oh, the Wanderers know it well!)
A beacon fire ’mid the gloom of night
The Shadow of Death Hotel.
Many a straggler battling back
Towards the coast-line far away,
Somehow loses the usual track
In the maze of saltbush grey ;
Roaming on till the day is dead
And a million stars shine pale,
Hearing the night-birds overhead,
And the fierce-eyed dingo’s wail;
Till far in front the warm lights flare —
(So I’ve heard the Wanderers tell!)
That night he sups on the best of fare
At the Shadow of Death Hotel.
Many there are that rest awhile,
Then pack their “ drums ” and go
Back to the dust-clad rank and file,
With footsteps weary and slow.
Others there are who linger long
Heeding not loved ones far,
And they raise their voices in wild, mad song
With dead mates at the bar.
Their grand old songs ring ouc on high
(Old mates, how the echoes swell 1)
As the last brief hours of Life fly by
At the Shadow of Death Hotel.
Out where the Drought-Fiends ever tread
Dust Tracks on the sun-burnt plain ;
Out where the scrub is waste and dead,
With never a sign of rain ;
Out where the luring mirage gleams
Under a blood-red sky ;
Out in the land of dead men’s dreams,
Out where the whirlwinds fly.
Where the blighted land has a heart of stone,
Where the cross-road leads to Hell.
Half-way house to the Great Unknown
Is the Shadow of Death Hotel!

He tried Port Hacking: after fish,
But only caught a cold,
He said, “ Atchoo ! By Jove, I wish
I’d done as I was told.
This is indeed a Hacking cough,
Good name it’s got I’m sure ! ”
But next day he was right enough

“Sapphire”: I have met “The Proo-
shan’s” lizard (B. 30/7/’08) many times in New
England (N.S. W.), and also near the Wilson River.
Touch one with a stick, and off flies an inch of tail.
Forthwith the vagrant inch grows madly agitated.
It begins boring operations. It spins round like
a demented top. For about three minutes the
earth is violently disturbed in its vicinity ; and
then all is quiet, and the inch lies down and rests.
It seems to be dovetailed to the remainder of the
lizard, and bushmen assert stoutly that its late
owner will return, if it gets a chance, and couple
up again with the section that has been reft from
it. These lir'rds are known colloquially as
“ wood adders,” and one generally meets them on
dead ironbarks. They are “ pyzonous ” all right.
Six inches of adder and our pup had an argument
one grey, sad day. The adder fled after a while,
but it left its tail on “Tiny’s” nose. Tiny
“crossed the bar” moaning.
A GOOD BRAND.
“Say, can I sell you a good rheumatic lotion!
“No, git it at the pub.”
“How about furniture polish or machine oil? ”
“Alius gits ’em at the pub.”
“I’ve got a dandy hair wash.”
“So's the pub.”
“ You seem to buy everything at the pub.”
“Oh no! Only whisky.”
“Kapai Te Tuna”: “Rocket” (B.
9/7/’08) doubts my qualifications as eel-expert.
Well, here is my diploma: Have eeled for 30
years in every waterhole, creek, and river between
Bluff and Moeraki (M.L.). In that time I have
caughteels from sin. long to 261 b. weight, and by the
following methods—spearing, shooting, gaffing,
dynamiting, guzzling, hooking, “bobbing,” hypno-
tising, and with eel-pot. Have eaten them baked,
boiled, fried, stewed, stuck-up, hashed, fricasseed,
raw, and sun-dried. Have worn eelskin around
my throat as a cure for laryngitis, next the skin
as a cold prophylactic, and on my feet as a chil-
blain eradicator. Have used the “floats” as
finger-stalls, and the rendered fat as a hair tonic.
Can “Rocket” say as much? I am glad
“Rocket ” told the world about the four-pounder
he got in the waterhole, because I have often
wondered what became of the tuna that I dragged
along the road in the dim past, and threw in that
self-same hole.
“ Cross Nib’s ” tale :—Fags’ reputation
was that of a swift mover till the fever tapped
him. Then a nurse, a thermometer and slops
hobbled him for about a month. When the hos-
pital people passed him out into the wider atmo-
sphere he was convex as to the waist-band, and
otherwise demoralised. So he sought work. The
boss subjected him to interrogation which Fags
answered in non-committal manner. His former
occupations savored of variety ; they ranged from
dairy-hand to shearing-machine expert. After
mature consideration the boss conferred upon him
the office of wood and water joey. The first item
upon his list of duties was to become attached to
a cow, and tear from the same lacteal refreshment
for all and sundry. Bucket in hand he sallied forth
next morning. The cow was eyeing her progeny
with affectionate placidity
when he arrived at the
yard, but upon observing
the approaching Fags
she retreated in dis-
order to the scrub.
Waving the bucket
wildly, he follow-
ed in pursuit. An
hour latter the
cow appeared with
Fags profanely
perspiring in the
rear. Amidst a
shower of miscel-
laneous missiles,
including Fags’
battered str a w
hat, 'she rushed
into the stock-
yard. Fags shut
the gate, find sat
down wearily
upon the up-
turned tin uten-
sil, waiting for his
temperature to
fall. In the inter-
val he delivered a
passionate oration,
punctuated with
many florid ad-
jectives, in which
the job and the
cow were referred
to with peculiar
pertinacity. Then
as his volubility
gradually dimin-
ished, he began to
take an interest
in the day’s work,
After a few min-
utes’ strenuous
pushing, accom-
panied by tail-
twisting, he suc-
ceeded in getting the
animal into the bail.
Fags then hung on to
her glandular conformation.
intent on annexing the calf’s cordial.
For a while she exhibited no interest in the
massaging operations. Suddenly came protest.
Standing upon three legs, she stirred up the
atmosphere with her off hind foot; but Fags,
confident in the retarding influence supplied by
the leg-rope, tugged away briskly. He con-
tinued for a few minutes. Inop-
portunely the fleshy tripod slipped
upon some spilt milk and capsized.
Ah Mee, the cook, hearing a despair-
ing shriek from the vicinity of the
stockyard, arrived in hot haste.
With the aid of an old shaft he
endeavored to lever the bovine from
Fags, recumbent. Happily for that
worthy, the leg-rope became de-
tached, and the animal resumed its
feet. Fags, upon his release, grasped
the milking-stool, and most ungrate-
fully smote the Pagan upon the
brow. “ That’s one f’r y’r guessin’
gear, y’r curry-faced squib,” he
hissed. “I’ll teach y’r t’ shove th’
ruddy ruminator on top uv me, y’r
stale-fat fakir.” Ah Mee, fearing a
recurrence of the milking-furniture,
decamped to the kitchen, locked the
door, and therebehind lamented like
unto a chained canine when the orb
of night is effulgent. The boss, dis-
turbed by the discord, proceeded to
the culinary department and re-
quested information respecting the
cause of the trouble. He received it
via the keyhole. At midday Fags
was following a former vocation—to
wit, supporting the bagman’s bundle.

The present Victorian Go-
vernment’s genius for bungling mostly
everything it puts its hoof into was
exhibited a little more thanusualaday
or two ago. Pursuing its policy of
aping the large benevolent personage, it sent 16
of the unemployed down to Trafalgar. That
gorgeous creative mistake, the Moe Swamp, hangs
out in those parts ; and the 16 had to get to
work on it. Arrived at Trafalgar, there was
no official to pilot them to the scene of the
accident, he being somewhere else engaged
on something or other. So the men led
the simple life in the local railway shed, and
managed to subsist on victuals supplied on tick
by a friendly storekeeper. The following day
the official turned up from otherwhere, and forth-
with led them to where picturesqueness had gone
insolvent. Having set them to work, he got lost
in the horizon for another day, by which time
their food was showing a deficit. When he tran-
spired again, they mentioned the subject of their
yearning interiors, and he, after informing them
that the poultry, etc., would be forwarded in-
stanter, concealed himself in the distance with
great success once more. They waited and
waited, and eventually were forced to con-
clude that the live-stock had perished from its
own previous deadness. Nothing had arrived but a
bitter wind and heavy rain. Gradually they were
reduced to stale bread and spuds. Gradually,
too, even these things became absent, and, as the
expert aforesaid was in the same condition, seven
of the workers made for Melbourne—three per
train, and four per hoof—leaving the other nine to
finish the banquet, and to start on the consump-
tion of the swamp when the festivities were over.
And as the swamp isn’t edible at this time of the
year, they will have to eke it out with their boots
and pick-handles. Bent always did treat his un-
employed luxuriously.
“ Gundy ” does his boss a service :
Was working for a dairyman recently, and had put in
most of my time skinning dead-uns. The district has for
years been infested with sable hawkers, on the lookout
for a night’s camp. I was sent to show Smoogee Britth
into the shed, one dark night, with strict injunctions
from the boss to do the deed in the dark, as the hay was
uninsured. I forgot to mention that there was a cowhide
pegged on the shed floor, and the darky camped fair on
it. Half-a-dozen dry skins hung above him, and when he
arrived at the kitchen, at breakfast time, with foam in
his whiskers and a hayfork in his hand, he was a tem-
pestuous and somewhat undressed Pagan. He inquired
earnestly for me. It took the boss all he knew to con-
vince the Hindu that the occurrence was due to my
ignorance of his religions prejudices. During the six
months which elapsed between that episode and my
honorable retirement from the cocky’s service, there was
never sight or smell of a Hindu about the homestead.

Alexander Montgomery, the braw Maori-
land Scot who is the one man in Australia to have
the job of State mining engineer, lately made an
inventory of the teams dragging things over the
tracks which branch out from Mt. Magnet,
in the wild north-west of Westralia, and
mostly pull up at Nunngarra or Sandstone
Horse teams, 33 ; camel teams, 6 ; donkey teams,
10; mule ditto, 2. There were some light horse
teams besides, but that list is relied upon to fairly
show the relative popularity of the various beasts
that the “bullocky” swears at in the West.
Curiously enough, there isn’t one real bullock in
the lot.
“ Poodgeregah ” : Re Harry Stockdale’s
criticism of the Arab horse (B. 23/7/’08), in which
he says:—
He has much to recommend him, in his good looks, his
docility, his courage, and, above all, in the incomparable
soundness of his legs and feet.
I agree with him as regards the docility and
tracta’oility of Arab stock, and I have seen scores
of them handled and broken-in, as two,- three- and
four-year-olds; but as regards being “incom-
parably sound” on their legs and feet, he is
undoubtedly wrong. I know two stations in
Southern Queensland that had Arab horses stand-
ing for a couple of seasons, and then gave them up
in disgust, as 90 percent, of the stock were weedy
and unsafe in the legs. The sire in each case was
a fine-looking horse, and was crossed with big,
well-bred mares.
THE BUSHMEN OF THE PAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
VIC.
Though they be ours, the splendid skies,
The prospects wide and vast,
They once belonged to other eyes—
The Bushmen’s of the Past.
They knew the old familiar trees,
The lichen-mottled boles,
The hollow limb that harbored bees,
The hoof-marred waterholes.
They knew the saplings, tall and thin,
The yellow, wheel-ridged ruts,
And the gre}' tracks that twisted in
To little grey-slabb. d huts.
They bad their troubles on the roads
With bullock-team and dray ;
With shaking bogs, and shifted loads,
And horses gone astray.
Through all those little things ol life
We reach to them our hand ;
The petty details of their strife
We know and understand.
The star-bestudded night above,
The arc of splendor vast,
Reminds us of their sturdy love—
The Bushmen of the Past
Who valued all things high and great ;
And, being men that build,
They roughly hewed the frame of State
That we thereafter gild.
They loved the things we love, that were
Keen spirits, kind and just—
That much of comradeship we bear
To their forgotten dust 1
Still, in life’s little things akin,
Dike us they feel—who knows?
Some breath of August enter in
When white epacris blows.
So we, linked still to them with lore
Of life in bush-ways cast,
Hail those strong souls who went before—
The Bushmen of the Past.
C. G. A. COLLES.
DAM THE RAIN!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Oh dam the rain !” the bushman said.
“ Oh dam, dam, dam ; oh dam the rain ! ”
The parson gravely shook his head ;
Such dreadful language gave him pain !
“ Consider, friend,” said he, “you know
How you have fared in seasons dry,
When scarce a blade of grass would grow
Beneath a cloudless brassy sky ! ”
“ Oh dam the rain ! ” the bushman cried.
In angry accents yet again ;
Although the sorrowing parson sighed,
“ Oh dam, dam, dam ; oh dam the rain ! ”
The parson turned to leave in haste.
“ Hold hard !” the bushman cried, “’tis plain
We let this rainfall go to waste
Whereas we ought to dam the rain 1 ”

No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of

Lyme X)ror: A good deal of foolishness is
written ahout “ the Blood of our Brother ” and how ic
is “crying from the ground.” If the inferior and un-
progressive races are wantonly killed off, that is plain
murder. If they obligingly die off, that is another thing.
The time must come in this rapidly-filling-up world when
murder of a kind—the murder that consists of the pre-
vention of birth or the slaying of the unborn—will be
necessary through lack of sustenance. And if we, by
strenuous efforts, fill the earth with semi-savage, or semi-
developed or unprogressive races, the progressive races
may later on have to commit suicide to make room. If
the African pigmj', for instance, has no future, why
should we want to encourage the pigmy to multiply
and occupy space that is none too abundant, especi-
ally' if the pigmy has no wild desire to multiply?....
Joureen : To put it shortly, your theory is that the
man locked himself in arid kicked himself nearly to
death. That is the best ground on which to base your
wild indignation about “these respectable citizens.”....
\V. Oran (or Cross): N.S.W. railways have a total length
of about 3600 miles. It was reported in the beginning of
1907 that “ the length of the trunk lines, local lines, local
joint lines and tubular lines including those now build-
ing ” (that seems to cover every tiling) “in Greater London
exceeds 630 miles.” Probably if you called the whole lot
650 miles it would be a liberal allowance. (See Nelson’s
Encyclopaedia published in 1907, volume VII.) News-
boy: “ Mornington ” hardly worth paper and ink....
L.J. K. : An ill-constructed ghost-yarn hasn’t the ghost of
a chance D.S. : Novel idea, but you don’t work it out
well enough Maisie S. : Has a faint llavor of original-
ity ... .S.S.T.: Preposterous, on the face of it Andy
H. : It has no organic unity. A slab might be cut out of
it almost anywhere without being missed Selma:
Nothing novel about it but the spelling H. Mac. :
Slightly improved, but still not good enough It. Mac :
The statement re the death of Patrick in the Cannibal
Isles would only amount to a picture of one person speak-
ing to another, and there are too many of them.. ..Carte
Rouge : Not very hopeful.. ..11. Pop : Not new. Not even
moderately new....J.D.G. : The swearing bulloeky is a
somewhat exhausted subject Alok : “Sensational”
enough, and the same applies to the libel suit that would
swiftly follow if we published it... Adair F.: Out of our line.
And Johnson of the Dictionary never said, “ And now we
will take a walk down Fleet-street.” G. A. Sala invented
the phrase as a tag for Temple Bab magazine....
Pivotorian : The decadence of sport in Geelong owing to
the upheaval there of Sabbatarianism is of scant general
interest.. ..Gerald : Some poetic thought, but the form
and style of both are too pretentious The Wasp : Glad
to hear you have procured light employment, and will
now have a chance to study and write. A life of cultured
ease is what you need if you are ever to produce a really
great work Giggles: Incident of the Benalla young
man who insisted on holding forth exhaustively at the
local mixed debating society, not on “ Discipline,” as he
was directed to, but on another theme of a, like sounding
name, yet unfit for polite ears, fails to appeal to u 5....
Maire : Bathos. One verse to prove it:
The kiwi calls at dusk his plaintive note,
And twilight settles o’er the sighing bush.
We drop our axes, gather up our coats,
And to the camp we gladly make a push.
.... J.A.A.: Haven’t the faintest idea. Do you take this
office for an aborigines’ dictionary?. ..A.E. : Blue-mouldy
with extreme eld. It would be a good scheme for you to
spend Is. in the published works of J. Miller, so as to get
an idea of what not to send to this paper C.D.A.: If
your friend, “ who is a great Bulletin reader," advised
you to send us a yarn on that topic, he was pulling your
leg.. ..O.G. (Townsville): Too rough J.F.H. : The
fact that an incident “actually happened” is not in
itself a recommendation. Some of the dreariest com-
munications that reach this office are recitals of occur-
rences vouched for by the, writers on affidavit as facts—
and many of them aggravate their offence, as you do, by
insufficient stamps.. ..Veritas : Unsuitable J.P.W. :
Don’t want “ other items as they present themselves to
you,” unless you can keep in mind that a Vic. Id. stamp
doesn’t carry into N.S.W Moana : Too vague and in-
volved. F’rinstance :
And the river of Time is a ghastly thing,
All flowing and motion ;
From its origin deep in Eternity’s spring
To the grave of Its Ocean.
And the Self is a haze and a vagueness, too ;
That never is known ;
But in partial phases of false or true
In the days that have flown.
G.W.G.M. : Puns all —and puns are fowl that this
office hatchets on sight A.J.M. : Your statement (in
verse) of what you would do if your love were a rose, or
if she became a peach-blossom, is hackneyed and unsatis-
factory. Many bards have tackled that view of the case.
Tell us rather what you would do if your love were a
wheelbarrow, or if she suddenly became a wharf or a
400-gallon tank R.W. : “The Coming of the Fleet”
isn’t bad as fleet poetry goes, but it is some way beneath

buck-up stave to Henry Lawson :
Never mind them, Henry Lawson, soul of genius thou

You will teach the world a lesson, though it be a sorry

Some quaint humor in it, but The Bulletin hasn’t much
space for theology these days Seyom : Story of pig

in one day—length of day no object, so long as it
doesn’t exceed 24 hours. What stands as a record
tramp in these parts was put up by Peter the
Kanaka, a giant of Otaheite. He carried his sick
mate, a white man of average size, and his swag,
also of average size, from Pyramid Creek
(N.S.W.) to Hill End hospital, distance 18 miles.
He used to leave the man and then go back for the
swag, then deposit the swag and proceed with the
man, thus covering the ground three times. Peter
handed the invalid over to an attendant, remark-
ing, “By G.hosh ! heem heavy ! ” Whereupon he
footed it back to Pyramid Creek again. For
stamina and dog-like faithfulness this performance
will be hard to vanquish. Though it took place
40 years ago, it is still a much-talked-of feat
throughout the district.

George Reid has had another bit of bad
luck., Barrister Scholes, who looked up the
K.C. s law for him in many a railway and other

never to stop and examine into the condition of flattened

that he was the defendant,, hurriedly put in a plea of

“Sr,”: Beere, the man to Whom Box
Judge, of Melbourne, gave 12 months for a six-
and-sixpenny fraud, possibly deserved more con-
sideration than he received. Bor months Beere
has been an eccentric institution round the city,
and his doings in connection with an American
Fleet Reception Committee, and his performances
on behalf of the unemployed, and his jack-in-the-
box appearances and disappearances in many other
respects have suggested doubts as to his sanity.
So did the amazing speech which he made to
Judge Box—in fact, Box, the Judge, seems to
have taken an absurdly serious view of Beere, the
six-and-sixpenny criminal. Six and sixpence
isn’t much, anyhow; in the same paper which
told how Box fell like an avalanche on Beere over
that small amount 1 saw that a man filed his
schedule for £lO,OOO.
Maoriland’s Parliament misses an old
identity this session through the removal of
L. M. Grace, for many years chief Maori inter-
preter to the House of Reps., and now promoted
to the editorship of the Maori edition of the
Government Gazette. He was the son of an
Anglican missionary at Taupo, right in the heart
of the native country, and was reared amongst
the semi-civilised tribes of that wild region. Bo
D. M. Grace and his brothers became proficient
Maori scholars at an early age, and they turned
their knowledge to useful account in after years
as historians and linguists. Grace is recognised
as one of the greatest living authorities on Maori
laws, customs and language. The billet of inter-
preter -to the House of Reps, will now be filled
entirely by Grace’s colleague, D. F. G. Barclay.
Barclay has had some strange experiences in his
time, one of them being when the irascible Wi
Pere assaulted him on the floor of the Legislative
Chamber during the progress of a debate, because
Barclay drew the line at some of Wi’s language.
Wi’s language was fairly violent at times.
Harnett, manager of the British football
team, maddened the editor of the Wanganui
(M.L.) paper (also several others) by his stric-
tures on the beer, morals, etc., of God’s own
country. This is how Wanganui smites its de-
tractor :
When Mr. Harnett brought his team to Wanganui he
called in to tell us about it, and for a full ten minutes
talked with all the force ot a tornado. His language was
scarcely suited to a drawing-room. Some people not
over-squeamish might have called it ratherdirtv. He in-
vited us to believe that while he had been forced, in In-
vercargill, to remain as dry as dust, heaps of other folks
were literally tumbling over one another in a disgusting
medley of cosmopolitan drunkenness. People were drunk
in the streets and drunk in the houses—it was a case of
whisky everywhere, and not a drop to drink ! His wiudv
tirade was so obviously exaggerated and so manifestly
ridiculous that we declined to lake his denunciation of
Invercargill any more seriously than we did his blatant
assertion that Dunedin was absolutely the most immoral
city he had ever “ struck ” ; that his men had been per-
sistently pestered by young girls, and that, taking one
thing with the other, while this sort of tiling might be
good enough for Maorilanders, it didn’t suit an English-
man of his calibre.
About an alarming nigger :
Australia has a record-breaker of a kind in William
King, who faced the P’ran (Vic.) court one dav latelv on
a charge of burglary with violence. William is a nigger
of magnificent physique, and as dangerous as maybe.
For the greater portion of the last 20 years the colored
alien has been cooling off in his Majesty’s sanatorium at
Coburg, where he has given exhibitions of ferocity that
have made him ten times an infernal nuisance, and no
less of a terror. Whether inside or out, he lias offered
strong suggestion of mental derangement; but no one—
much less the law—has thought of treating Willie as a
criminal lunatic. His rare spells of liberty have been
brief—simply because his crime lust is quite irrestrain-
able. Of him it may be said that the King can do no
right. His more frequent spells of gaol have been long,
because his crimes were attended, almost alwavs, by
abnormal practices. His burglary was nearly always
supplemented by a filthy defilement of the- place he
robbed ; and, if disturbed, he was invariably a wild beast.
More by luck than judgment he escaped the hangman
on one or two occasions. His last stretch was for ten
years, awarded on Ist June, 1900. He was released on
15th ult., though, on account of his unpleasant conduct
while in his Majesty’s jug, he would not have been en-
titled to quit until 12th February next. Apparently, he
was turned loose on somebody’s recommendation, but,
judging by his last two or three outrages, he should
never have been liberated at all. He received his ten
years for a couple of bimrlaries, one of which was at-
tended by a merciless attack on a young girl at P’ran,
under circumstances too horrible for general mention. He
had been out just 17 days when he was up again, accused
of entering another dwelling and of nearly strangling a
lady in bed. In all, William is too dangerous to be at
large, and looks like the fittest candidate for an indeter-
minate sentence or a lunatic asylum that has appeared
up to date. Anyhow, P’ran is really thankful that, he has
been gathered in again. During his 17 days of liberty,
those that knew of him lived in a State of jumps arid
timorous speculations. They understood him far better
than the law does.
EXPERIENTIA DOCET.
EDITOR (to budding novelist): “Yes, that yarn
of yours was very good. You appear to
have had some experience in fiction."
THE ASPIRANT (cheerfully): “Oh, yes! I used to explain things for a land-agent."
“Bill”: Should Bryan, the Democratic
nominee for the TJ.S. Presidency, succeed in
defeating Taft, the Republican nominee, be will
be the first man who ever Won at the third attempt,
Jefferson, Jackson and Glover Cleveland were the
only ones to be elected after even a first defeat.
Cleveland’s case is unique. He was elected in
1884, defeated in 1888, and elected again in 1892.
The notion regarding the hopelessness of the case
of a candidate who has been twice defeated
amounts to almost a superstition in Yankeeland.
A VICTORIAN VISION.
No, it is not that at all I It is Governor
Carmichael standing alongside of Premier Bent.
Chief Justice Griffith delivered his Trade
Marks judgment in the icy, unemotional tone that
used to aggravate the hot-blooded politicians of
the old Queensland Parliament. The Palmers,
Mcllwraiths, and Lumley Hills were wont to call
Griffith names on account of his frigidity. The
average temperature of the Queensland Assembly
towards midnight in those flushed and drinking
times used to rise to about 100°, and Moll wraith’s
head used to smoke visibly. Then Griffith would
make a “deliverance” —people got into the habit
of calling his speeches “deliverances’’—that was
like iced soda without a stick in it, and the tem-
perature would drop so violently that Mcllwraith
would reach for his overcoat. It is said that it
was the draught from one of Griffith’s speeches
that started Moll wraith’s fatal illness.
JOIE DE VIVRE—LOST AND REGAINED,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lord Crewe, speaking of Lord Dudley, Australia’s future
Governor-General, rejoiced in his capacity to do serious
work “without abandoning the joie de vivre which was
the possession that every man ih public life ought to
cling- to with the utmost desperation,”—S. M. HeralD
'6/81’OS).
There came a time Wheh the pub’s cheery lights
No more attracted me ;
Arguments left me Cold ; eVen dog-fights
1 eyed lack-lUstrel.V.
BeCr lost its savor ; so did whisky, riini
Aild gin. 1 sourly steered
Away from drink, add remained coid and ddmli,
Wliile gladsome dipsos, cheered.
You Would have felt disgusted had you irtet
Me at a music-hall .
In those drear days. The dainty footlights’ pet
Allured me not at all.
Her red,nosed friend, the lodger, 1 abhorred ;
No adulat’ry smiles
He Won from me, for f was tired and bored
With lodgers and their wiles.
Then, the Administration of the day
A Justice of the Peace
Created me, I fell to straightaway.
And struggled sans surcease—
Struggled ’gainst Gloom, and on behalf of Glee ;
Being in Public Life,
I joined (on principle) in revelry
Wherever it was rife.
’Tu ns bitter hard at first to have to quaff
Champagne and smoke cigars,
And merry make, and utter the loud laugh
That on sta d virtue jars,
I loathed embracing ladies, yet I grew
A jaw, and kissed them all,
Not once, but many times—for thus I knew
I answered Duty’s call.
Day after day I fouglit the weary fight
Nor Joy of Life. At last
Through a thick drink-haze one beer-smitten night
I saw the worst was past.
Blind in a bar I sat, bubbling with fnn,
A barmaid on each knee ;
Joy hal returned, and the good fight was done—
Mine was the victory*

PRICE, AND HIS OMINOUS COLLAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The speaker wore a high collar.—S. M. Herald’s
pained commentary ( S/8/’08 ) on J. E. Price, Socialist.
I sing of Price, J. E.
Pew philosophic citizens will swear
About the way a Price adjusts his hair ;
Ho one forbids a Socialist to wear
Hat, boots—even of socks a modest pair ;
But this arrests one’s journalistic flair,
Shocking it sore—or, as the Scotch say, “sair.”
It should not, should not be.
Price Wore his collar high !
Record the shameful fact.on lasting brass,
Scarify this Invader of our class,
Things have, in sooth, attained a pretty pass
When Prices—common fellows, callow, crass—
Pre-empt a patch on the sartorial grass
Reserved till now for folks outside the mass
Of those who Greid defy.
How coarsely insolent!
It’s not as though J. Price were in a bank
Or wholesale house ; if so the world would thank
Him for his neck-gear, eloquent of rank
And social standing. Price calls liquor “ swank ”
One doubts not ; and strikes matches on his flank
And swears—in fact’s an anarchistic crank,
Possibly violent.
Price brings stark Pear on deck.
He, I feel sure’s the Dread G. Reid foretold
A while ago. Banks will yield up their gold
To such as he. Red Sosh will get a hold.
In Paddy’s Market maidens will be sold
By weight. I see the Serpent Drink unfold
Its alcoholic tail and grow more bold
Por lack of scotching. Friends I would not scold
Unduly, but my blood runs icy cold
What time I brood on Price, and his throat-mould.
An omen ’tis — Anti-Sosh drowned and rolled,
Mangled ’boat Labor’s neck !
N.S.W.

ONLY ONE WAY TO CUEE
KHEUMATISM
Drive it Out op the Blood,
A Severe Case Cured This Way by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills—Suffered for years
—Knees Stiff and Painpul—Hobbling
About on a Stick—Not an Ache or
Pain Now.
Because rheumatism is a blood disease, abd Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are a medicine for the blood,
there’s hope and healing for pain-racked rheu-
matics in every dose of them. Pill by pill, dose
by dose they help to form new health-giving blood
free from the acid that causes the burning twinges
of rheumatism. The cure begins with the
first dose.
Because rheumatism is in the blood, liniments,
lotions and hot applications won’t cure it. It’s not
common-sense to expect it. Rheumatism isn’t
skin deep. It’s blood deep. Therefore to cure it:
a blood medicine.
That Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured rheu-
matism isn’t a claim and a boast: it’s an estab-
lished fact. Week after week reports of cures
have appeared in the newspapers. Some hundreds
of cases have been published all over Australia,
with name and street address of the cured person
given. It’s open to anyone who lives near to call
and find out for themselves. Amongst the latest
cures is Mrs. Mary Schaefer, 29 Middle Street,
Sydney, who says
“Even as a girl I was always subject to rheu-
matism,” said Mrs. Schaefer. “At first both
shins were affected. Later on in life it attacked
me in both hips—in fact, the pain was all up my
legs. I’d get rid of it for a little while every now
and then, but it always came back. For years I
walked with a stick'about the house, and never
ventured outside without one. I always had a
gnawing, nagging pain in both legs. I felt it
especially when I got warm in bed, and I’d lie
awake for hours. When rain was hanging about
I’d always feel worse. If I moved, a spasm of
pain would shoot through me, and make me cry
out. I could only hobble about. My knees ached,
and got so stiff that I could not kneel—to do a
little scrubbing was out of the question. Fortu-
nately, I saw Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People advertised, and I thought that I would give
them a trial. The second box did me good. When
I started the third box the stiffness was not nearly
so bad. From that on I began to improve rapidly,
the constant nagging pain left my legs, and I
could sleep at night. In the end, Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills cured my rheumatism completely, and
I have never had a return of it since.”
If you are not quite sure whether your illness is
caused by bad blood, write to The Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co. of Australasia, Ltd., Sydney.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A troubled ghost hoisted itself up and
waved a tentacle at the Speaker in N.S.W.
Assembly last week, when Varney Parkes,
M.L.A., thought he had found somewhere an
“understanding ” to the effect that the Australian
Parliament was to be out of Melbourne by the end
of 1908. The Government regretfully informed
Parkes that it couldn’t find the alleged under-
standing, and the subject dropped on the floor.
Some curious charges are brought against
the Australian Government these times. Said Trea-
surer Wilson of Westralia in a recent two-column
wail: “ The point on which I now join issue is
that they propose to charge loan expenditure to
revenue And the awful Wilson seemed to really
believe that the Commonwealth, its sin of not
getting into debt being thus exposed, would
stagger out covered with shame, and hang itself
by the neck on a thistle.
STOLEN BLESSINGS.
Isaaac said: “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the
hands are the hands of Esau.... Art thou my very son
Exau?” And he Jacob said, “lam! ’’—Scripture.
The Bent Government makes the most Liberal
promises, but it makes them out of a Conservative
mouth. —AGE.
In 1906 and 1907 the number of em-
ployees in the factories of Sydney and suburbs
increased by 9036, and the number of factories
increased by 150. It isn’t a bad result for a city
that is supposed to be ruined by Protection and
Federal tyranny. If the Australian Government
has any more ruins of the kind to spare,
Sydney will accept them thankfully. In fact, it
is just yearning for ruins.
A co. with £lOO,OOO capital expects, thanks
to the new Australian tariff, to have a big, new
woollen mill at work at Marrickville (Sydney)
by next February. Twenty-two years agoN.S.W.
had eight woollen mills, but despite the fact that
the best wool supply on earth was at its doors the
industry faded under the Freetrade curse till only
three survived. Now there are five, and more are
coming. Yet the anti-Australian and importing
person still holds forth in the Sydney papers about
the tariff being devised “ wholly in Victoria’s in-
terests.”
Laborite Cornelius O’Brien, who won the
Central Province Legislative Council election in
Westralia, got there by the sharpest nose on
record. The verdict at the declaration of the poll
was “ a dead heat.” The returning officer
gave his casting vote for O’Brien. A recount of
all formal ballot papers then took place and the
result gave O’Brien a lead of five. The votes
rejected as informal were then gone through and
equitable re-adjustment produced another dead
heat. Once more .the returning officer’s casting
vote was added to the figure total, and this time
Cornelius definitely squeezed home.
It is always the unexpected that happens,
and in Maoriland a fool stipendiary magistrate
who gave a girl three months for stealing a purse
and smote a wife-beater with a 20s. fine,
has proved a great law reformer. His vagaries
have roused Parliament, and the Inferior Courts
Procedure Bill contains a few salutary clauses
which will do something towards equalising the
punishment for offences against property and
offences against the person. At present wife-
beating is about the cheapest form of illegal
amusement in Maoriland, but when the new Act
is passed it is expected to become much dearer.
Judging by the brands on some com-
pressors and other heavy mining machinery
received the other day at Cloncurry (Q.), the Jap
has pushed his nose into that business too. Un-
less the brands lie, either the Monkey has been
up to his old trick of imitating well-known
American manufactures, or the American firm of
compressor and rock-drill makers has put up
works in Japan in order to make use of Japanese
engineers at 11s. a week and foundry laborers at
sd. a day. And that’s the sort of competition
that Knox (who bulks large in Cloncurry mining,
by the way), Irvine, and the rest of the “ Corner ”
crowd reckons can be met with a Protection of
about per cent !
A thousand times “the backbone of the
country” and “the great primary industries”
have been assured that they can’t possibly gain
anything from Protection and the encouragement
of manufactures. But the Farmer and Settler,
the sheet issued in the interests of the N.S.W.
Farmers and Settlers’ Association, says “Rats !”
to that, and blows in with the following :
According to the Chief Railway Commissioner, the
principal cause of delay in getting additional stock trucks,
when the shortage became evident, was the fact that the
N.S.W. Government imports its axles and wheels from
England. If we had had a healthy iron and steel industry
at Lithgow, whether protected by Customs duties or
encouraged by a bonus, we might have had those stock
trucks turned out expeditiously at local works. Under
the policy of buying- nothing at home that we can get
abroad a fraction cheaper, there is naturally great delay,
and our stock die while the required axles and wheels are
doing the grand tour of the world.
When the Sydney tram employees went on
strike Premier Wade insisted that the men should
go back to work unconditionally, and then he
would set the machinery of the Industrial Disputes
Act in motion. The men went back to work, but
so far the machinery of the Act is motionless.
When the rich ironmaster, Hoskins, locked out
his employees the Premier did not discover that
Mr. Hoskins was
a law breaker, nor
did he insist that
he should reopen
his works uncon-
ditionally till the
Court had de-
cided whether his
action was justifi-
able. The Court
is moving like the
mills of God, ex-
ceedingly slowq
and the works re-
main closed up to
time of writing.
This is one of the
proofs that the
Wade Act is ab-
solutely fair to
both parties, and
possibly ill us-
trates what Min-
ister Wood meant
when he said that
the strike would
show who was
“top dog.” It is
not often that a
Minister is frank enough to admit that he and his
crowd are dogs. Anyhow, if he was bound to
allude to animals, why didn’t he describe his
crowd as the cows on top ?
' Already whispers circulate about a “com-
pliment ” to N.S.W. Premier Wade in commemo-
ration of his “firm constitutional attitude ” during
the Sydney tram strike. The notion is to send
him to England on a holiday to gather in the
kudos that seems to abound there for men who
are, or are accounted to be, able to keep the Aus-
tralian workman in his place. Irvine is quoted as
a precedent. Further, Wade is encouraged to
take the Premiership with him. Of course, the
idea is that he should go on some little “ mission ”
or other which will serve as an excuse for a vote
of public money. Reid took £5OO away with him,
and Carruthers, though minus the Premiership,
bagged £l2OO.
By a lawyer :
The N.S.W. Industrial Disputes Act was supposed to
provide an absolutely final industrial court, from which
there could be no appeal. But already an attempt has been
made to “ prohibit ” a decision of the Court. The attempt
failed, but some of the Judges of the State Pull Court
seemed dubious. The “ unappealable Court,” as a matter
of fact, is a delusion. Its decision can always be appealed
against on the ground that in coming to the decision it
“exceeded its jurisdiction,” and, of course, when it ex-
ceeds its jurisdiction it is no longer an Arbitration Court,
unappealable or otherwise, but merely a gentleman in a
wig talking through his neck. The only way to make
the Arbitration Court absolutely final seems to be to pass
an Act stating that the Arbitration Judge can do what he
darned well pleases while sitting in his judicial capacity,
and, as he might then order Hoskins,,of Lithgow, to be
hanged, or a whole trades union to be beheaded with a
blunt axe, that wouldn’t do.
Sydney Telegraph, blowing the Free-
trade trumpet the other day, declared that,
owing to Freetrade, not one loaf of rye-bread, not
one dog or one horse is eaten in Britain. Well,
Ireland under Freetrade is often reduced to using
potato-bread, and the people of the north of Free-
trade Scotland live largely on oats. As to the
horse, how could the English railway servants
(say) on 16s. a week afford to eat horse ?
“ WHEN YOUR PANTS BEGIN TO GO."
Perth, Friday.—The police have had reported to them
a theft of pearls from Onslow, valued at between £2OOO
and £3OOO, the property of the brothers Dan and Louis
M’Daniel.
The story told by the brothers is that they decided to
secrete their pearls, and accordingly placed them in the
lining of a suit of clothes and in the heels of boots. This
apparel was then placed in an old portmanteau and left
at an hotel in Onslow.
This was last December, and the brothers returned to
their fleet. A few more pearls were discovered, and
months later one of the brothers returned to Onslow to
add these to the secreted store. He then found the port-
manteau had been stolen, presumably by someone hard
up for a suit of clothes.
The proposal that N.S.W. Parliament
should meet at 2.30 p.m, instead of 4.30 has failed
again. One time, in the old mixed Council days,
Parliament did meet at the earlier hour, but very
few members appeared till after four. The
Government used to rush through all the nefarious
jobs in that sparsely-attended interval. “ I would
advise,” said Robert Lowe, when elected for St.
Vincent, “ constituencies never to return a lawyer
to represent them in this Council, as while he is
detained in court the country may suffer.” He
added that he was late once, being detained in
court over a matter of 155., and he got to the
House to find a £26,000 swindle just put through.
Lowe was a loud shouter for political purity in
those days, and when there was a job to be done
it was postponed till the Government scout re-
ported that Lowe was busy somewhere.
“ Edyson ” writes : —-
Everything plays into the hands of the speculator, and
the “ shindykit,” and the Trust, When cold storage came
along, it was to be an undiluted blessing to mankind, but
it has been left too much to Private Enterprise, and
to-day it is the strongest instrument in the hands of the
blighter who is out to corner the people’s meals. No
sooner are there hints and indications of a coming short-
age in any line of perishable comestibles than the specu-
lator, who profits by the misfortunes of his kind, gets
after the available supplies, and hastens the climax by
cold-storing all the goods he can lay paws upon. The
coming of the Americans has established an enormous
demand for meat, fruit, vegetables, butter, eggs, etc., at
a time when there is an unfortunate natural shortage,
and the speculative harpies have stocked every available
foot of cold storage to take full advantage of a great
opportunity, with the result that the family of the day-
laborer in Melbourne is compelled to do something very
like a perish. This is likely to occasion a tepid welcome
for Uncle Samuel’s sailors on the part of the workers, who
are led to look upon the coming friendly invasion as some-
thing in the nature of a plague of locusts.
“Goril”: Willy Kelly told a bevy of
shuddering old women at Kensington (Sydney)
during the tram strike that —
He had heard it stated that if the Federal Labor Party
were in power the police would not be used in this con-
nection to maintain order. These were considerations of
the gravest moment. They would have to think of what
they would get if a Ministry holding those views were in
power.
Now I, “Goril,” heard it stated that if Willy
Kelly had been in power he would have ordered
the military to load up with explosive bullets, fire
promiscuously down George-street at everybody
in sight, and then, cursing horribly, to
charge with the bayonet on the assembled
masses, and give no quarter. Of course, I have no
proof that Willy would have done this, but that
doesn’t matter a hang. I maintain that my yarn
is more feasible than Willy’s, if only for this
reason : If W. Kelly had been in power, he would
have possessed some, authority over the military.
Had the Federal Labor Party been in power, it
would have had no more authority over the
N.S.W. police than has Long Lan Tun, taotai of
Swatow.
Stuart-Robertson, M.L.A. for Camper-
down, dealt N.S.W. Premier Wade a heavy one
on the jaw re the row that the Carruthers-Wade
Government made over the proposal to concen-
trate the Federal stamp-printing business at
Adelaide. People thought from the shindy that
arose that a most important industry was going to
be dragged from the Ma State. Instead of which,
it turns out the great industry amounts to 10 men,
one hand copper-plate machine, two letterpress
machines, two perforating machines, value in all
£1360, with a wage sheet of £1656. Premier-
Wade replied: “Are not ten men worth
fighting for?” They are; but so far Pre-
mier Wade has not shown any inclination
to fight for some hundreds or thousands of
men by having his railways material made in -
the State. If all the engines and rolling stock
of N.S.W. were made in home foundries, N.S.W.
would never miss the loss of the ten men in the
stamp printing office. But very naturally a man
with the eye of an insect could only detect little
things such as employ 10 men. Industries that
might employ thousands are invisible to the crea-
ture owing to the small range of its outlook.
The Bulletin notices with regret the
entire absence from the daily press of any scath-
ing references to the “mutiny” or “revolt” or
“rebellion” at Perth (W.A.). There certain
journalists, not content with the accommodation
provided for reporters at Parliament House, went
on strike—just as the Sydney tramway men did.
The effect of the “strike” was to paralyse the
Government of the country, for the House
wouldn’t proceed with its debates in the absence
of the reporters, and the session had to be hurried
to a close. But the daily papers seem to treat
the incident lightly ; and any sympathies they
have are with the reporters who have thus dared
to bail up the highest institution in the State.
From the “ Old Soldier ” :
Some people have “militarism” on the brain. The
S. M. Herald, the other day, announced that things
during the tram strike might have been as bad in Sydney
as they were in Paris if it hadn’t been “by reason of our
freedom from militarism.” As to that, note first this
from the Australian Defence Act. Section 98 kindly pro-
vides :—“No member of the Defence Force shall be sen-
tenced to death by any court-martial except for mutiny,
desertion to the enemy, or traitorously delivering up to
the enemy any garrison.” French “militarism” has
abolished even that remnant of savagery. When the
Clemenceau Government came into power, and General
Picquart was made War Minister, courts-martial were
abolished once for all in the French army. The Herald
doesn’t know that universal service is the very negation
of militarism, because young men of all classes are swept
into the ranks, and, while reasonable discipline is easily
maintained, arbitrary tyranny is sure to be resented with
effect. It is only volunteer armies like the British or the
Australian, or the French or German armies of the 18th
century, that require a Draconian system of punishments
to keep them in order.
Under the N.S.W. Liquor Law the
jeuncsse dore of the State must not play billiards
on licensed premises if under 18 years old (the
jcunesse dord, not the premises). Recently a
Uralla publican was fined £2 for permitting a
young gent to play on his table only 17 years and
10 months old (the young gent, not the table).
Bung strongly objected on the ground that the
cueist didn’t have his birth certificate about him,
and he (Bung) couldn’t tell his age by his teeth. He
couldn’t say whether the offending player was 17
and three months or 18 years and one month. Per
medium of expensive counsel he came all the way
to Sydney to ask Justice Sly if he could be
expected to. Mr. Sly agreed that it was prepos-
terous, or something like that, and some more of
the bottom fell out of Wade’s Beer Act.
Notable that the Deformers who snuffle
virtuously over the illegal conduct of tram drivers
and conductors in leaving.their cars as a protest
against inequitable treatment, are the same old
Deformers who supported Carruthers in violently
breaking the law, the other day, in regard to his
wire-netting seizure. Deform argues that the
tramway strike leaders deserve exclusion from
their billets for their “contemptuous treatment of
the law of the land,” and in the same breath
urges that the law-contemptuous Carruthers
should be paid special allowances to represent Ma
State in England. Deformers are inconsistent
people, and Deform is a muddled, illogical old
creed in very sooth these days. ■■ ■• ,
BULL'S BOUNTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the Old-Age Pensions Bill was before the House
of Lords, Lord Cromer said it was a “ financial revolu-
tion.” Viscount St. Aldwyn said, “The financial aspects
are very grave.” Lord Lansdowne said if the Bill were
passed “ the country must stand in a much weaker posi-
tion. It is a burden from which the country will never
secure emancipation.” Lord Rosebery said, “It is
Socialism, pure and simple, and the prospect fills me with
despair.”
The British lord delights in thrift
And dignity of Labor.
Workers, till you are dead, uplift
Bull’s pick or saw or sabre.
A helping hand is proffer-ed
To Toil; the agitator
Can draw a pension when he’s dead,
Or thereabouts, or later.
Why should the Briton emigrate
And be a reckless roamer ?
John Bull’s new bounty runs the State
To ruin, says Lord Cromer.
If British working men have sense
To sweat enough, and meekly,
At 65, in affluence
They’ll draw their Five Bob weekly.
Lords grind false teeth, and pull their hair
In wild exasperation.
The prospect fills them with despair.
It weakens Balfour’s nation.
“ Why should we help the working men,”
They cry, “ to reckless living?
We’ll get much Cheaper Labor when
No idle bread we’re giving.
“ With fireless room and empty maw
Let Toil be aye surrounded 1 ”
This is the Gospel and the Law
By Noble Lords expounded.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
_ . Sydney, August 10, 1908.
My Dear Arini,—
Orgies, mostly made up of frocks, food,
scandal, Bridge, frenzied finance, and the break-
ing of one of the most important of the com-
mandments, is what Upton Sinclair’s new book
lhe Metropolis ’ (Roycroft Library) suggests,
it is not literature. Upton doesn’t write litera-
ture. Large, crude slabs of allegations about the
Smart Set—the New York Four Hundred-
are thrown at the reader like coals, and
remind one of the large masses of unsavory
animal food in the same writer’s “Jungle.”
Some of the statements about the efforts of the
women to out-dress and outmoneyscatter (I in-
vented that word) one another make the imagina-
tion stretch out like a racked indiarubber heretic.
One woman has a 200,000-dollar fur coat, but she
is eclipsed by another, who owns a coat worth
1,000,000 dollars. This coat is insured for 500,000
dollars. It is made of the soft plumage of rare
birds from Hawaii, where the royal house of
Kamehameha used to hang out, and it took
20 years to build. Every feather was crescent-
shaped, and there were wonderful designs in gold
crimson and black. A leader of the Smart Set
asks the hero to come home with her “to see her
babies.” Up she goes in his estimation. But the
babies are a pair of tiny dogs. (That idea isn’t
new; Mark Twain used it up 35 years ago
ln .j le Gilded Age.”) For these animals the
horrid female keeps an expert nurse, to whom she
pays 100 dollars a month ; also the brutes have a
footman and a special cuisine, a regular dentist
and a physician. “ I know women,” says some-
one, “ who have a dozen sets of furs —ermine,
chinchilla, black fox, baby lamb, and musk and
sable ; and I know a man whose chauffeur quit
him because he wouldn’t buy him a 10,000 dollar
fur coat.”
In Sinclair s amazing tale, several thousand
dollars are paid for gowns that are only worn
twice or thrice. One Smart Setter, who would
pay 50,000 dollars “at a clip” for a few frocks,
never wore hers more than once. Then her
butler solemnly cremated them as if he were
burning the dead. Another had just had 14
trunks of gowns sent up from the Customs House.
Each one came stuffed with tissue paper, and
attached to each was a piece of the material from
which the shoemaker would make shoes or slippers
to match. There were street costumes, tea-gowns,
ball and dinner gowns. Most of the latter were
to be embroidered with jewellery before they were
worn, and imitation gems were sewn on to show
where the real ones should be placed. Some of
these gowns were so filmy that the women who
made them had to sit in damp cellars, because the
sunlight would dry the fine threads, and they
would break ; a single yard of the lace repre-
sented 40 days of labor, and it was so fine that it
was hardly even rabbit-proof. There was a
pastel batiste de soie Pompadour robe that
had cost 1000 dollars; there was a hat to
go with it that had cost 125, and shoes of grey
antelope skin, buckled with mother-of-pearl, that
had cost 40. Then there was a gorgeous and
intricate ball dress of pale-green chiffon satin,
with orchids embroidered in oxidised silver, and a
long Court train studded with diamonds. This
cost 6000 dollars, without the jewels.
None of these Smart Setters would consider her
wardrobe complete without coats and opera wraps
of “ white unborn baby lamb.” The fact that the
baby lamb fur is “unborn” is stressed until the
reader gets the exhausted sensation. Gold or
jewelled-handled parasols are made to match each
gown. A woman, married or unmarried, explains
one of the leaders, might travel with a man all
over Europe, and everyone know she did so, but
it would make no difference so long as she did not
do it in America. A comic opera prima donna
was engaged by a bunch of Trust magnates to sing
at a banquet. She arrived towards the close of
the feast, and her song was “Won’t You Come
and Play With Me ? ” At the third verse the
magnates took the invitation literally, and the
lady escaped from the room with half her clothing
torn off her. If “The Metropolis” be only
half a correct picture, the guns of the American
Fleet ought to bombard the two miles of Fifth
Avenue, and Madison Avenue, and Riverside
Drive—of course when the whole of the collective
millionaire and family is at home.
Reception by the Ladies of Sydney
to .
Mrs. Noah Brusso
(Mrs. Tommy Burns).
The remainder of the invitation doesn’t matter.
I’d rather miss the Northcotes’ ball in Fleet week
than that function. It occurs to-morrow. If I
could only induce Mrs. Tommy Burns, after the
tea and cake, to do six rounds with one of our
Smart Set for a reasonable purse !
lhe attractive little widow of an English rector,
Mrs. Venables Williams, daughter of Sir William
Pink, of Shrover Hall, Hants, who arrived
by the Mongolia, and was married to Mr.
J. Hamilton Dobbie at Scots’ Church, Mel-
bourne, to-day. The wedded brace will live
m a pretty humpy, known as “The Camp,” at
Double Bay. The father of the bridegroom-elect
was a dour Scotch parson who used to correspond
some with the late Queen Victoria on the Seven
Deadly Virtues—and dogs. He was a very doggy
man, and on the subject of collies was more read-
able than when he was discoursing on the impor-
tant and picturesque. Sonny J. H. used to be an
enthusiastic dog exhibitor in this State. Major
George Steward, official secretary to the Governor-
General, lent his moral support to the bridegroom
at the ceremony when the Voice Breathed.
Arrangements for the reception and swearing-in
of the Dudley personage are in the hands of Major
Steward, who will come to Sydney to take
delivery of the valuable package.
Three bright-haired, pinky-faced sisters, Him-
melhoeh by name, took the fancy of your Akenehi
at the Grand Fancy Dress Carnival at the Glaci-
anum. They were got up as dairymaids, and
carried little milking-stools, and the men with them
had wisps of hay sticking out of their mouths and
in their ha ts. Otherwise they (the men) were garbed
as dairymaids’ associates, or rather aides-de-camp-
in-waiting to the Cow. The girls looked ice
2?, ai £ en ®> rem inded of some in Hans Andersen’s
bluffy Tales, and of Aurora Borealis and Norway
and tinkling sleigh bells across the snow. Doubt-
less the cows they milked were of the reindeer
persuasion. Another good bunch was the “Uncle
lorn s Cabin ” combination. Mrs. W. Baumann,
got up as Aunt Dinah, nigger-wigged, blacked,
and frocked just as H. Beecher Stowe described
her, was the limit. Her little daughter was
lopsy and -wheeled the Cabin. Mrs. Alec
Hay, Misjs Daisie Willis, and Miss Burdekin
ntted accurately the disguise of Dresden i
China. The Motor Team was about the
best-carried-out trick on the icy premises. The
teamsters were dressed correctly in wind-
proof frocks and veils, and the men had coats made
of woolly dog, or some such matter, and their
acetylenes streamed into the darkness a mile
ahead. (N.B. —This isn’t true, because there was
no darkness inside the Glaciarium.) Some girls
named Mann and Miss Holly Coffee were the
motorists jvho didn’t run over anything.
A capital idea for Hospital Saturday collectors
was supplied by four men. Don’t know
what they called themselves, but they were
as long as the Python when he stands
on his tail and puts a Baden Powell hat on
his head apd drapes a long black garment from
his neck to the ground. They skated splendidly,
and were able to look condescendingly into the
eyes of the gallery, and to thrust inquisitive heads
far over amongst the spectators outside the rail-
ings. Hospital collectors got up like them might
stand on tljie footway in Bent-street, and insert a
coin-seeking head into the upper storey windows
of the Unibn Club, where the selfish bachelor sits
reading a sporting paper. Also, in residential
neighborhoods they might pass the plate down
the chimney.
Consummate artiste as Miss Anglin is, the
continuousness of her stage lying is beginning
to pall. It is a curious fact that the three
plays in which she has faced Sydney all ex-
hibit her as an astounding liar/ There is a
play called “The Liars’’—probably because
the name was pre-empted, Clyde Fitch called
his bag of fabrications “ The Truth.” In
“The Truth,” which was put on at Her
Majesty’s on Saturday night, Miss Anglin
drops falsehoods all the way, but does it
so gracefully that one is doped sometimes into
thinking qf a rain of pearls, and forgetting the
underlying vulgarity of the character. The play
ends happily. Becky isn’t going to tell any more
falsehoods, and hubby takes her back ; but every-
one knows that the real liar—the instinctive liar
such as Becky—is never reformed. The drunkard,
and the person with the Blotted Past, and the
thief may be reformed, but never the chronic
departer from the truth. More than one of Syd-
ney’s haute noblesse ought to be doing, at time of
writing, three years’ light manual labor for lying.
“The Truth” is a well-frocked play. Miss
Alma Vaughan starts the Untruths in a Princess
gown of something that seems expensive. It is
prune in color, with two long, black tails of
Liberty satin, finished with tassels, falling from
the region of the heart almost to the
frock-tail. I The yoke, of clear tucked net and
insertion, is a marvel in the way of “fit.”
The only woman who speaks the truth in the play
is Miss Eileen Anglin (who is on the programme
as Miss Warren), and she scarcely speaks at all.
But she looks charming in black Liberty satin,
with bright pink roSes over her ribs (she’s mar-
vellously slender) and on her wide black hat.
When big sister Margaret Anglin comes on in a
grey-blue chiffon satin, with a wide high belt of
gold and Asiatic embroidery, and the three, the
Blue, the Black, and the Prune, with beautiful
furs, go up stage and down stage and pad about
like angry felines, one feels that sohemers
schemed to; some purpose in this color scheme.
Miss Anglin does “business” with a dainty
drawing-robm chair, upholstered in blue, same as
her frock. Its woodwork is gold, same as her
belt. Its build is doubtful, same as her assertions.
Another Anglin frock is of white silk muslin
oyer mauve, and tucked and laced. A mauve
girdle and a bunch of white and mauve lilac help
to make heij fibbing endurable. She expresses her
breaking heart and her intention of dropping the
lying habit, as if it were portable property, in a
brown crepe frock with a lot of Val. lace about the
sleeves and yoke. The expression is admirable,
but she contradicts it with a flamingo hat and a
bit of flamingo at her throat. Miss Susie Vaughan
as the widowed landlady, in shiny black and cheap
turquoise blue ribbon, would be an adorable per-
son to have with you on a wet day to make you
laugh. Her lies about her family and her French
education are merely humorous, and don’t suggest
moral dry rot.
Mrs. Ford, wife of the imported-from-America
comedian now playing in “ The Red Mill,” will
soon be given a chance to fling an airy fairy toe in
Sydney’s face. She turns out to be a noted dancer,
but didn’t give the fact away until she got bored
with the wet outlook and the patter of rain. Rain
has pattered since she and the man whom she is
pledged to obey reached these shores, and the
dancing of the raindrops in the mud puddles
keeps reminding her that her feet are elastic, and
that her tread doesn’t permanently crush the
slight harebell any more than did the boots
of Walter Scott’s Lady of the Lake. And she
is a peach in the matter of looks, with the
fine height, the blue eyes, and the infantile fair-
ness of hail 1 and complexion that most of the
American stage and other women who come here
possess. The U.S. is full of Gretchens and
Wilhelms, so, in many cases, perhaps there is
Teutonic ancestry to account for the flaxen top-
knot, the turquoise blue eyes, and the creamy
skins of the visitors. The baby-faced Vikingess
Nance O’Neil, Mrs, Kolker, Mrs. Ford, the
little Tivoli charmer Miss Kokin, are white and
gold and blue. Miss Anglin, Miss Ola Humphrey,
and the lady who was Miss Maud Jeffries are
mezzo in coloring. But not one is brunette.
Mr. Stanley Mackay, the progressive young
Muff whose name used to bob up whenever the
Muffs gave a dramatic performance, has cast off
the shackles of the bank in which for ten years he
held a stiddy job. His alternative job was fancy
and historical costume designing and hiring out,
and what was at first only a hobby developed
until, when at last he had to make a choice between
removal to a country branch of the bank (with
promotion) and his glorified old clo’ business, it
paid him to choose the clo’. He stage-managed
Mr. Arthur Adams’ ‘ ‘Blamed Cat,’’and did it quite
Herbert Flemmingly. Persons named Stanley
should have a lot of go about them to justify
Marmion’s last yelp on the battlefield of Flodderi.
Then he urged Stanley to shove ahead, and
advised Chester to charge, and I presume Chester
at once marked up all his prices and called it a
cheap sale.
A scream from a Sydney girl in Adelaide:
“Miss Beatrice Day wears a gown in ‘Simple
Simon’ that almost drew the eyes out of my head.
It is of rose-point lace with mother-of-pearl scales
and gold sequins. And with it she wears a ravish-
ing sable motor-coat and hat, and inuff of brown.
Polyphemus, the cyclops-eyed cat that is used
in ‘ The Morals of Marcus,’ has been distinguishing
himself. After his part in the play he walked
over the footlights and climbed to the topmost
box, from which bad eminence he watched the
rest of the performance out of his splendid one
eye.
The orange blossoms of the brides of this winter
won’t wilt through dryness. Miss Zelma Aronson
wore hers on a rainy day in last dripping week.
She has married Mr. Stuart Macphail, who is
something in the partner way in a big wholesale
warehouse. Her ivory Empire robe of satin
duchesse with Limerick lace swathed a pretty
bride. Her ma, Mrs. Fred Aronson, will now go
to live in Melbourne, minus the company of her
one ewe offspring.
Another wet-day bride was Miss Lindeman
(daughter of a retired R.N.), who married one
Anthony Ivo Pelham, a brother of the Earl of
Chichester. He earns bloater-paste for his crust
in a billet on some Asiatic railways.
Two hundred pounds and over were collected for
the Lady Northcote presentation. The classic,
gold loving-cup, or tear-jug, is being sown with
Australian gems, and will soon be ready for
the pretty speech with which the Lady will
receive The Empire Leaguers have already
given her Ex. their sweet, sad remembrancer. It
is a silver box with a big pearl in the middle, and
other Australian-found gems planted on the four
corners.
One of the nice girl visitors lured here by the
coming of the White Armada is Miss Victoria
Crowther, a daughter of Dr. E. L. Crowther,
M.H.A., of Tasmania. She is staying with Dr.
Jessie Aspinall’s ma at Rose Bay.
The military Hoad brace put in a sirocco of a
time in Sydney adieuing their friends, enemies,
and neutrals. Their gigantic second son goes
hence with them. Their only daughter died some
years ago ; she burst a blood vessel in the brain
whilst skipping.
Mrs. Ambrose Pratt is in Sydney on a visit to
her sister, Mrs. Harry Austin, and defying the
ungentle rain that falls alike on blondes and
brunettes. A some years’ residence in Melbourne,
where “the line of beauty is Bent,” hasn’t im-
paired the visitor’s gift of wearing brown with
pink corals, and brown and pink roses.
The Australia Hotel Uhr Smith family is going
to quit the big caravanserai with the two bronze
damsels at its entrance and take a house at Darling
Point. Pa Smith, the manager, isn’t quitt ng the
management, so he can’t Vie missed, but the going
of Mrs. will create a horrible vacuum. She was
the confidante of the couples that got engaged
there, and the joyful sympathiser with the
honeymoon pair, and the vigorous comforter of
the sick tourist, and the imported songstress or
other artiste who gets red and swollen eyes be-
cause she is so far from her beloved motherling.
Some of them do that weep even though the
beloved motherling died when they were born,
and they never saw her. In that case it is merely
an affecting pose.
Manager Major Ramaciotti, with Mrs., has
returned from Cairns, and reports that the
weather welcome he and the other Sydneysiders
encountered was warm. The rain was heavier
and even more persistent than that from which.,lie
fled. The Agricultural Show, various costumes,
and a lot of tempers were spoilt by the gentle slop
from Heaven. ;
Miss Ella Caspers, the young Australian con-
tralto, will give a matinee concert in the Town
Hall next Saturday. Excellency Rawson has
granted his patronage.
Still another of the remarkable Harnbourg
family has become famous. Besides Mark, who
shook his mane in a Chopin programme in Sydney
Town Hall on Friday, there were already two
brothers whom musical papers call famous—Jan,
the violinist, and Boris, who has conquered the
violin’s big brother, the ’cello. Now id is a sister,
Galia, and her fame comes through an extraordi-
nary divorce case. Reginald Grey Coke, a rackety
nephew of the Earl of Leicester, was married to
an Englishwoman. After one or two reconcilia-
tions the Earl’s nephew went to America,
drifted out to Nebraska for a few days,
and notified in an Omaha paper that if
his lawful wedded wife didn’t turn up in
24 hours or thereabouts he would get somebody
else to cook his chop. The Leicester family
doesn’t seem to take in the Omaha papers as a
regular thing, so the lady didn’t turn up ; and then
Nebraska promptly presented the husband with a
divorce decree. Whereupon the Leicester offshoot
sought out Miss Galia, and honored Mark Ham-
bourg by making him his brother-in-law, to the
enormous surprise of the wife he'd left behind
him—she didn’t know a word about it till she saw
her husband’s marriage notice in a London news-
paper. Then she went to a Divorce Judge, who
said stinging things about Nebraska, and declined
to recognise its divorce decrees, and treated the
Leicester offshoot’s second marriage as mere
bigamy. So whether Mark is really related to
the Earl of Leicester or not, I don’t know. He is
in Nebraska, but lie doesn’t seem to be in England.
But the affair threatens to be what lawyers call
a “ leading case,” anyway.
Which recalls that the Bishop of New Guinea
has been telling the other gaiters in England how
the natives manage these matters in his improve-
ment-lease corner of the vineyard. In Papua,
according to Stone-Wigg, if the gentleman nigger
won’t eat the missionary or other trifle which the
lady nigger has cooked for his supper, she accepts
it as a divorce, and leaves his wigwam. It seems
drastic. But still one can’t be too careful of one’s
indigestion.

It is asserted on unreliable authority that
a very ancient profession is making vast prepara-
tions in Melbourne for the entertainment of
Uncle Sam when lie happens along. Obscure
villas in obscurer neighborhoods are being fitted
upas branch establishments, and new and com-
modious premises have been engaged in the city.
That may be true or not; but it cannot be gain-
said that an extravagant amount of sham com-
plexion and open work stocking of the more
obvious sort is to be seen in one or two of Mel-
bourne’s seaside suburbs just now.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 10, 1908.
My Dear Yarrie,—
• ne ou Governor-Lady drives daily seeing the
sights. She does the Zoo and the Museum, and
perhaps the Waxworks. Her Ex. is kept warm
the while by magnificent sables that nearly incite
women worshippers to a revolution, and dowdy
T 1 *® Y? at rn , a ' :e tlle,n bill down and thank heaven
that their hats are not as other hats are. The
two nieces—fair, stodgy little girls—wear broad-
brimmed head garniture tied uncompromisingly
under their prim little chins. One is named
lenelope, so it seems probable that the other
is labitha though really I don’t know what’s
wrong with her being Deborah.
Lady Gibson-Carmichael, our new Governoress
is cosmopolitan or nothing. She was a Nugent of
the Irish family that has its head in Lord West-
meath. One of her uncles is a baron of the Aus-
trian Empire. Lord Southampton, an Ena-lish-
man of the Angles, is among her cousins, and her
grandfather was one Theodore Baltazzi, of Con-
stantinople.
Celia Ghiloni s husband provides another warn-
ing to young men who risk matrimony with dam-
sels who possess theatrical tendencies, together
with natural qualifications for the stage. Celia
was only 19 when Barnett Breslau, aged 22, took
her for better or for worse and congratulated him-
self on having secured a prize. His bonnie bride
was presently singing for Manager Rickards, and
three years later she joined the Williamson Opera
Co. 1 rom that time the domestic life of Breslau be-
came fitful and uncertain. The lady “followed her
career ” and the husband followed her from Mel-
bourne to Sydney, making his home there. But
her career took her so often from home in Sydney
that he returned to Melbourne with the idea of
getting her wifely companionship whenever she
happened in that city. The career, however, had
given her a distaste for domesticity and Breslau
In due course she wrote to him: “Apart from
our incompatibility of temper, my professional
demands preclude the idea of my living with you
again.” A divorce on the ground of desertion.
Curtain.
Everybody who was anybody drifted up to the
Exhibition last week “to see about a dorg.”
I he annual show of canines proclaims itself with-
out advertisement. If you own a prize poodle
you plunge valiantly through the bark and roar
and pull up ecstatically at that particqlar port.
I hen you discuss its points above the clamor to
any wayfarer who will listen. All are happy but
the dogs. At these flea-bitten functions the
bulldogs mostly maintain a gloomy, cvnical
silence, and the puckered foreheads and bored
expression of the Dachshunds, with their sausagy
toes turned out, is pathetic.
One stand at the Exhibition made an inter-
national flag—the Lion and the Lamb, also the
Monkey and the Bear, lying down together A
prize bulldog was beside a typical American bull
pup, which glowered at a miniature Japanese
spaniel boxed next to a cream-silk Siberian aris-
tocrat, and the crowd was flanked by German
Pomeranians matching their black fur against
two Chinese dogs—black as ink, foxy-furred
and blue-tongued. These Chinese dogs belong
to Miss Estelle de Beere, a Maorilander,
famous both as a dancer and a
fancier Miss E. de B. has shown some
of her dozen or so dogs all over the world, from
Christchurch to London. She teaches Maoriland
to dance when she is not whirling a lightsome toe
herself, or inciting a canine to walk on its hind
limbs. -Three sets of dogs belong to the North-
cote-Clarkes —the black Pomeranians, the ab-
surdly affected little Japanese prize-winner, and
the altogether adorable silky-woolly Si berian.' The
Siberian is a creamy white. She is the only one
of her km in Melbourne, and is like a big fox
with a generous forehead. This superior lady-
dog is used to trotting the young Northcote-
Clarkes about in a small red-harnessed buggy
and has concentrated devotion in her eyes. The
Carmichael-Governors visited the show on
Wednesday, the very youthful Carmichael niece
squealing with delight when the Clarke offspring
offered her a ride behind Woolly-Bear. The
Beebels put in three magnificent Great Danes
When I covet in real earnest, I covet a Great Dane
though there is something alluring and subtly
compelling about a baby bulldog—it is so crumpled
and fatuous, and it grins so affectionately and
idiotically at a fondling hand.
Judkins and all the Methody ministers collected
to lend pomp and dignity to the stone-laying of
new quarters at the Burwood Boys’ Training
Home—that up-to-date Farm instituted by Big
Edgar of the Central Mission. Chief Justice Mad
den had been booked for the trowel work, but wired
h' s Bendigo sessions wouldn’t let him
off m tune. (Yet, if he left off the practice of
holding forth at great length to the defendant
before passing sentence, he might save a whole lot
nil j 01 ? - ' t^le P res ident of the Methodists
filled the gap, and the others took turns at talking
on the masonry. Various donors of cheques ex-
pressed their fervor by laying a brick. Iceberg
Irvine, member for the district, and his brother
politicians, Mauger and Sampson, motored out
for the show, whilst “ Juddy,” who possesses a
farm near by,' had merely to climb over the fence
and come along. The new building, it seems, will
provide dormitories for 30 more boys ; also a huge
schoolroom. Rev. G. H. Cole manages the place
a practical farmer as well as a sky-pilot—
and m addition to the common or earthy farm-
work, a big industry is made of canning and
bottling fruit from the orchards. The Home
s kreet-boys sent by the Mission for practical
drilling and training, before they are placed as
handy lads ” under the care of farmers, who
teach them strict .economy and attention to busi-
ness, and bring them to a full knowledge of how
many pumpkins make five.
A ball rolled itself giddily round the C.L.C.
(Catholic Ladies.’ College) on Monday night at
Melbourne Town Hall. The Maddens blazed in
full frill, also the gaud Mayor and his untirable
Lady. Mrs. Senator St. Ledger and Mrs.
Eugenie Duggan Anderson humped things, as
Atlas did, on their fair shoulders, and altogether
there was more energy put into the show than
has whipped up for years for a dance. One must
be festive or freeze these cold nights. “Sets”
were the wild interest of the occasion. Mrs. St.
Ledger evolved a “Portia” set. Mrs. levers’’
girls, in Dresden China, looked as if they’d break.
There were Wattle sets, and Flatne-tree frisks,
and debutantes who formed their own white
never-been-kissed ring. Di Giiio played soulfully
for the whirly toe.
That pink-and-white-cheeked flower of youthful
law-expounders, Lieutenant Gerald Something-
hyphen Blackbourne, returns to Melbourne this
week with his new little bride, after a Sydney
honeymooning. The new Mrs. Blackbourne is a
daughter of solicitor Maxwell, of Ballarat.
A multi-millionaire’s son, Alexander K. Watson
(a cork of that old bottle, whisky-distiller Watson)
has been wandering round Australia and Maori-
land takingaplacdoverlookat thetriumphalmarch
of his own particular brand of cussed der-rink. The
Australasian head of the firm, who was acting, as
guide, found quite a hold-up in Dunedin
When eventually he dragged His Whiskyship
to Melbourne, that young man spent all his
time despatching cables to Pa-in-Scotland and
Ma-travelling-on-the-Continent. announcing his
discovery of “the dearest girl in the world.”
Now Pa, Ma and The Firm have cabled
blessings and congratulations, and an enamored
youth has bolted back to Dunedin to hustle the
banns. The young lady ,is a daughter of Dr.
McPherson, of Dunedin. All the lassies are
bonnie and sonsie and Scotch in that Edinboro’ of
the South.
Two Melbourne girls make readv for a free and
unchaperoned festivity on uncommon lines. They
intend to “do” Java, Borneo, and Burmah in
one comprehensive rampage. Justice Hood’s
pretty daughter Rate and her .chum, Mab Kelly
(the George Kellys’ hopeful), comprise the valiant
pair.
There almost happened a serious block in the
march of “The Merry Widow” on a recent
Saturday night. A friend of Carrie-the-Merry,
who owns a big German motor, took that young
lady for a spin to Geelong. On the way back,
somewhere near Werribee, the imported and un-
reliable box of tricks broke down. Carrie danced
with excitement, but the implement remained
dead and torpid. A bucolic person’s buggy was
plodding past, and she begged a lift. As she
settled into her seat she fervently thanked
Plodder, the farmer, and explained the importance
of being in Melbourne. “I’m Carrie Moore,’’she
volunteered. “ Down you get! ” sternly said the
heifer-chaser. I don t hold with play-acting.”
And behold an amazed Carrie was left standing
in the country with afternoon travelling
madly on to theatre time. The next sail* on
the horizon was a motor cycle. The undaunted
Carrie appealed to he-of-the-goggles, and climbed
up behind. She rode on the back of that cycle
till she nearly died with hanging on. Then a
poor, puffing, one-seated motor hove in sight, and
its owner gladly took the distracted little mum-
meress aboard, and puffed and wheezed with her
into Melbourne. She got to the theatre just in
time to change her dress—just when Higginson
was turning green and yellow, and Manager Tallis
was tearing his hair, and understudy Ivy Scott
was anxiously repeating her lines. Alas ! for the
understudy who thus finds the cup of opportunity
dashed from her lips.
The dames and spinsters of the Australian
Kennel Club entertained the Wiggses of the
Cabbage Patch at tea in the South Yarra Skating
Rink last Wednesday. There were no dogs, no
cabbages and no skating ; also there was no Patch.
Which shows how misleading are words in some
cases. But there was the cup that does not
inebriate, and harmless bun and much talk.
Mrs. Wiggs-Dwyer ran in for 10 minutes. She
was sprinting to see how many farewell teas it
was possible to do in one afternoon. I never
heard the result—the lady was too exhausted by
the plethora of Bun to disclose the figures, and
the unofficial time-keeper had dropped out half
way.
The other ladies of the company did not
attempt gymnastics ; they stayed right there with
the Kennel Club combination, and talked Yankee.
Miss Busby said, “ We’ve all bin so ill with colds
we really haven’t had time to get ’quainted,” and
now they all leave for Adelaide, and at Fleet
Time (dread sound) for Sydney. By the way
Miss Raymond is the most real.thing in self-
sacrifice I have ever seen. She is a beautiful girl-
beautiful .in feature, and figure, and coloring •
but as Miss Eichorn in “The Cabbage Patch,”
she distorts herself as thoroughly as the “comic
relief ”in a raging melodrama. Histrionic art has
much to answer for.
Prime Minister Deakin opened a private view
of still some more pictures on Saturday afternoon.
Hans Heysen. the young South Australian artist,
is the claimant for notice, and his claim is a shout.
His work is very strong. An occasional canvas
has been shown at the V.A.S., and one rather un-
characteristic painting is in the Gallery, but so far
Heysen has been little known. Most of the
works in his present collection have been painted
within the last two years—and yet there are about
150 shown.
Hans Heysen has caught the spirit of the Gum
Tree. There are gums jn .every stage of their
lives—isome dark and sombre and stately, others
ragged, with the curled slats of bark tearing and
flapping and streaking along the ground. There
are, too, the great giants with naked white bodies
.strong m the sunlight, Oneof these, “ A Lord of
the Bush, ” has been (or is to be) purchased by the
trustees of the Melbourne Gallery.
Another probable purchase for the Gallery is
“A Midsummer Morning”—an excellent atmo-
spheric effect in the half-awakened dawn. The
sheep have a grotesque look—but it is the
natural clumsy tumble of the baas over rough
ground as they are driven quickly from grazing.
The sense of movement is good, and the muttons
have the browny duskiness of Australian sheep.
Artists so often want to paint them snowy white,
as in the clean, neat fields of England. Our running
muttons are never white except for a few days
after shearing.
The show will be open until the 22nd August,
and already the well-beloved scarlet dot marks
the collection in growing clusters.
~ Mark Hambourg rose to inspired heights on
Saturday night. Maybe the special spurt was
inspired by a wonderful appreciation penned by
an expert Professor in one of the dailies. It was
certainly calculated to “buck up” any fitful artist
temperament. Chopin’s B flat minor sonata was
the meat of the programme, and its impressive
Marche Funebre was so ghostly as to make the
audience’s respective hairs stand on end.
throughout this number the house was hypno-
tised—not a sound and not a rustle. Women
forgot to look at the other Cat’s dress. There was
not even acough, which proves the hypnotic miracle
theory, for all through the rest of the concert
the cough—the irritating, pecking, barkingcough—
rattled round the echoing, cold, cavernous hall
likea'rifleshot. One man would bark, and straight-
way he would be answered in every key from
every corner. The hall was full of the bliie-and-
white school-girl miss. She came in flocks, with
her giggle and her rustle and her woollen
“fascinator” for her pig-tailed head. Mrs.
Hambourg was there again with her soulful gaze
and her big fur coat. Marshall-Hall had Schliiter,
the fair anaemic-looking Dane, along with him.
The unfortunate Brasseys have suffered exciting
times. A fire destroyed the whole of one wing of
their country house. Normanhurst Court, at
Battle (the place always marked with a sword on
English map's), in Sussex. The baronial Brasseys
had a big house-party on at the time, and all the
guests gave a hand to the pump. His lordship
himself danced about on the roof and dodged the
debris—without once falling off, although he is
now 73 and might have been expected to contri-
bute several sickening thuds to the catastrophe.
Evidently the old gentleman improves with age.
Much of his treasure collected on the voyages of
the Sunbeam (he fell over 300,000 knots in all,
I m told) was burnt, in spite of the heroism of the
fashionables who fought the flames.
“Mario” writes from Brisbane :
The opening of the Show festivities was heralded on
Saturday by mixed weather and the first influx of country
visitors. Despite the mixed weather, Mr. and Mrs
Kubelik wandered down from the Gresham to Flavelle’s’
and Mrs. K. admitted that “the beau-ti-ful black opal
quite won my heart.” Even the smileless Jan of the
tombstone countenance was moved to admiration by the
local gems, and the couple are reputed to be taking away
a sackful of them. In the afternoon the weather dried
itself with blotting paper to some extent, and the Jan lot
got as far as the gloomy Council Chamber, where his
podgy Worship and the plump Misses tendered them
Bananaland’s warm, if somewhat haphazard, welcome.
Meanwhile the Governor and his partner, accompanied
by their youngest hopeful, were spilling words of wisdom
at the British Picture Show,, amid a fashionable throng
and an artist or two. The pallid Excellency is always
right on the note, so to speak, and his suggestion that if
the guarantors (of whom he is one) get back their money
they should hand it over again to purchase some memento
for the very poorly-stocked gallery here, was a brilliant
idea from the public point of view. The temporary gal-
lery (it’s a pity that it is poked away in such a back corner)
looks very well now that it is dressed up, so to speak, and
one of the finest sightsin it is the Prince of Wales Empire
Cup, won twice by the local Grammar School boys.
Great was the splendor of the annual hop of the naval
and military forces, on Thursday evening, on the sloping
floor of the Exhibition Hall. There was not a hitch,
and the supper, served in a marquee which seated 300,’
was a high-class item. Lady Chelmsford, in grev silver-
spangled gauze ; Mrs. Military Commandant Lvster, in
heliotrope and gold embroideries ; and two charming-
ladies in precisely the same tint of blue and white stripes,
were features of the evening. So was the Naval Com-
mandant, just back from the North, and quite recovered
from the ’flu’.
The Challenger men and a heap of society folk frivolled
on board on Wednesday evening. The ship looked as
beautiful as a picture with its hundreds of lights reflected
in the waters of Garden Reach.
There was also a very swagger At Home at the John-
sonian Club on Friday evening, when 250 guests, includ-
ing Government House en masse, attended. The one
curious contretemps was the non-arrival of a certain
Society pianiste, who had undertaken to tinkle for the
benefit of the guests.
We had a citizens’ banquet the other night—l say “ we,”
because the women were invited to look on, and, later, to
sit up and take some light nourishment. Why the banquet
occurred, I forget, but it seemed full of bush aldermen.
They fed in the Exhibition Hall, about 800 bushies and
others, and put away the food on a generous scale. Then
there were speeches, and the elderly acting-Premier
Barlow got quite humorous.
A trouble from which we have long been free has come
upon us again. This is the lady who goes about demanding
to be invited where she isn’t wanted. Our present
sample is said to have been at four functions already
without an invitation. Some people are getting annoyed,
and are saying that a body may be found in the river
almost any day if the grievance continues.
“Bosna” writes from Adelaide:—
Ethel Hantke, who gave a farewell torrent of song in
the Town Hall t’other evening, with the intention of sail-
ing back to Britain, has suddenly changed her mind. She
is going to drop her profession with a thud, and take up
the steady job of matrimony (“ the holy bonds of pad-
lock,” as someone has aptly put it). The man to whom
Providence has been good is Mr. Billy Cowan, one of a
moneyed squattocratic family, which hangs out its private
shingle at Narracoorte.
’Tis rumored that Abe Shannon, B.C. (Bachelor of
Clothes), is engaged to be married, and that the lady who
will look after his wardrobe in future is the daughter of
another shekeled South Australian. The beauteous Abe
has recently been seen gazing at ties in Bond-street,
London, in her company. The rumor is probably an un-
true lie, however, as Adelaide’s chief frock-coater would
have no trunk-space to spare for feminine frills and
furbelows.
The Premier’s welcomes are still going strong. Thebar-
ton, another portion of St. Peter’s, has offered him the
official hand, and sundry institutions and societies have
added their quota of speeches. If Mr. Price hadn’t towed
a motor hohie, wherewith he can speed from one function
to another, his life would be spent in wild leapings from
a cab to a hall, and from a hall back to a cab. In the
middle of the month he and Mrs. Price speed over to
Sydney to shake hands with the U.S. Admiral, and the
bos’n, and the ship’s cook.
The School of Mines boys had a very large attack of
energy before their ball in the Brookman Hall, the other
evening—a joyous episode at which some hundreds of
jolly youngsters disported themselves. The hosts took
the whole business on their own shoulders, and not a
sister or a cousin or an aunt was permitted to even put a
finger on the decorations. Among them the boys manufac-
tured some 20,000 or so pink paper blooms, and with these
and long ropes of asparagus fern they festooned the whole
landscape until that landscape’s own parent wouldn’t
have known it. The school colors, blue and gold, were
draped round the walls; and a few thousand more dainty
boy-manufactured blooms and a ton or so of palms made
a dreamland of the stage. Langdon Bonython and some
of his staff and its wife, and some of the Council and its
very best half, lent an air of dignity to the proceedings.
Also the Premier and his wife came in on the heel of one
of their many welcomes, and stayed to the end. They
had a young daughter among the revellers. Mrs. Price’s
raiment was a beauteous black silk with soft lace tucker
and scarf; the daughter was a pictureof simplicity in-a
white muslin and lace confection.
Same ballroom and decorations were used on Fridav for
the conversazione and dance in honor of the visiting
Varsity hockey girls. It’s the first time any sweet iriri
under-graduates have come from other States to seek for
laurels on this side, and the local damsels were on their
mettle to give them a good time. Next dav the home
team carried the visitors on a picnic jaunt'to the hills
and on Sunday they all tea’d and bunned at Montefiore
with the Chancellor Ways. "tenore

ball happened on 31st July, and next day the huntsmen
went forth and galloped madly after nothing “ihe

Governor Le Hunte got into the Psyche last week and
paddled that gallant vessel up the Gulf. Port Pirie Port
Lincoln, Port Augusta, and Wallaroo all had a ball and
sang “God Save” and “The Song of Australia.” ’
The best-known of the women of the innumerable
Chinner family, of S. Aus., died the other day greatly
lamented. This was “Mrs. W. 8.,” a lady known not
only to every good Methodist, but wherever there was
philanthropic work to do. She was a damditer of the
ate G. W. Cotton, M.L.C., the father of the homestead
blocks system of close settlement, and helped in that
well-remembered old gentleman’s efforts on behalf of
other people.

Bad Results of
Tram Accident.
The Case of Mrs. Mackie.
Nothing but good can result in giving to the
public some hint as to the various incidents in
which Mrs. Kate Mackie, of No. 2 Stanlev-street,
Woolloomooloo, once played a prominent part.
In beginning her story, Mrs. Mackie said
“The ups and downs of life experienced by me
since arriving from Kilkenny, fifty years ago,
would make interesting reading, and I must say
that, taken altogether, I have a great deal to be
thankful for.”
“You have had your share of bad luck, as well
as good luck, like most people,” suggested the
pressman, who had called on a mission of enquiry.
“ Indeed, I have, and I consider the worst mis-
fortune that befel me was in connection with an
accident that happened two years ago, when I
was unfortunately the central figure. I intended
visiting Lavender Bay, and when I got as far as
Circular Quay in the tram, I was in the act of
alighting, when the car started off, and I was
thrown on to my face and hands on to the road.
A notable bump, such as 1 got, does not agree
with a woman well up in years, and my system
suffered severely from the terrible shock I received.
I was thrown out of gear altogether, and it looked
for some time as though the consequences were
going to be very serious, for I might have died.
My nerves were fairly broken up. To give you an
idea of the fright I received, I may tell you that I
have not been in a tram since. I have a positive
dread of them. I believe if I boarded one of them
now I would take a fit, my aversion is so strong.”
“ Perhaps you are still suffering from nervous-
n6 “ S Oh, don’t you believe it; for I was not long
in getting something that attended to my troubles
in respect to nerves, and I chanced to read of it
Clements Tonic—in the papers. The advertise-
ment I read appeared before me one day, like a
beacon acting as a guide to a mariner in distress.
The case fitted in with my own in some respects,
and something whispered to me that Clements
Tonic was what I required to put my system to-
gether again. And, believe me, sir, I was fear-
fully weak and ill, not a vestige of strength
remaining in my body. It must have been dread-
ful for other people to see me shaking like I did,
and I could.not have written with a pen for any-
thing. But how wretched I was at night, not a
wink of sleep ever coming to my relief, while the
thoughts that ran through my brain were some-
thing horrible. The same round of things went
on from day to day—no appetite for breakfast,
dinner, or tea ; a head that felt like bursting with
aches from daylight till dark, and then on through
the night; when I stood up, a giddy feeling that
made things appear to be turning around in the
room ; terrible pains in the chest, and no life or
energy to help me withstand it —no wonder I felt
that I would rather be dead than alive.”
“Yes ; there is not much to live for when one’s
trials are so great.”
“And another thing I suffered from for years
was palpitation of the heart, and had tried nearly
every known medicine in the hope of getting
relief, but no—not till I bought some Clements
Tonic, and then I certainly did get something for
my money. And, oh ! what a joyful surprise it
was when I at length realised that my nervous
affections were commencing to subside, for the
possibility that threatened of being a confirmed
invalid for life became more remote as each bottle
of Clements Tonic was finished. The constant
twitching of the nerves at last gave way to a
steadiness that had hitherto been unknown to me,
and in every respect (in regard to my digestion,
especially) I was reaping benefit each day. 1
thanked God for my good fortune in coming into
contact with Clements Tonic, as it was undoubt-
edly the one remedy that saved me. My illness
had pulled me down a lot, but through sleeping
so soundly, and eating so well, under the influence
of my latest medicine, I picked up wonderfully,
and was soon as right as could be.”
“This can be published, Mrs. Mackie?”
“Yes; in any form your mind suggests.”

“ Mallarapoonie ”: This scribe hasn’t been
much outside Australia, and for that reason often
Wonders whether J. Hull leaves things—old iron
especially—lying round in other parts of the globe as he
does here. If so, the Chow and the nigger and the other
Occasional Person must also wonder what manner of
curious casual being Bull is. When the Australian aban-
dons a mine he mostly leaves only a heap of mullock, the
hole the mullock came out of, a bough shed, some char-
coal, and the stump of a tree that his anvil stood
on. But not so Bull. Starting from the old
Blinman mine, in S.A., there is a trail of old
iron, abandoned mines, defunct smelter sites, and
scrap heaps generally right round to as far north as
Mount Garnet in Queensland. After that there is the old
iron of Einasleigh (now being renewed), and the holes
and the old iron strewn across the Etheridge to Croydon.
Then come the old smelting works way back in Olon-
curr.v. Further out, in the Northern Territory, Bull has
laid up for himself treasures of old iron on earth, but,
alas, the rust and the white ant corrupt and the
nigger bruiseth up Bull’s iron into spear-heads. And so on
to the West is the same old trail of rust, the same old tale
of white ants, even to the confines of human habitation,
where the skeletons of Bull’s old batteries bleach on the
edge of Westralian deserts. Some day Bull will drag a
lot of old iron out on to Sturt’s Stony Desert and leave it
there, and then he’ll have the world’s record for pro-
miscuousness in old iron.

Maoriland has had another illustration of how
“Private Enterprise can always do the thing better.”
Seven years ago dining cars were put on the express
trains between Christchurch arid Dunedin. There was
such a howl when J. Ward proposed that the Government
should do the catering that the right to feed the hungry
public was let by tender, and for five years good old
Private Enterprise served up a menu that never varied.
The same old leather masqueraded as steak, and the same
cold joints were hurled at the defenceless traveller. The
stops had been cut down to bedrock, the longest
being eight minutes, and the refreshment-rooms along
the line soon went out of business ; so the traveller had
to take what Private Enterprise offered him or starve.
One eventful day, J. Ward had occasion to use a
car, and results followed. When the lessee’s term
expired, Private Enterprise (which hadn’t shown any
enterprise worth a cent) was passed into outer
darkness, and the Government took a hand. It
appointed its own cooks, waiters and managers.
Most important of all, it began to consider the public.
Now, on the through daily expresses between Christ-
church and the Bluff, passengers can get a good break-
fast, a four-course dinner, and a warm tea. The meals
are well cooked, the menu is lengthy and varied, the atten-
tion all that can be desired, and the car and tables are clean
and attractive ; and yet the price is the same as it was
when Private Enterprise was having its fling with the
adamantine beefsteak and the dried and haggard mustard
pot.
A co. is getting to work on the deposits of
guano which exist in Olsen’s and Johansen’s caves, 1,(5
miles from Rockhampton (Q.). The guano,, so far as it
has been probed, averages 10 per cent, phosphoric acid,,
I’s per cent, nitrogen, and I's per cent, potash. The co..
talks in big figures—reckons that the manure heap may
be worth anything up to £2,000,000 ; and a plant is to be
erected on the Fitzroy River to prepare the stuff for ship-
ment. The managing director is journalist Chaplin, who
was for a brief spell Director of Agriculture in Westralia.

J. J. O’Brien, of Capella, Clermont, is the first
landowner in that section of Central Queensland to prove
his faith in the cotton industry. He has commenced to
plant an area of 30 acres. The farm is to be managed by
Rowan, an American, who has proved his ability to pick
cotton in Australia profitably by gathering at the rate of
2901 b. per day of ten hours, which at id. per lb. means
Is. 2£d. per hour. In America, during the flush of a busy
season, he has picked up to 5001 b. per day. With the
better wage conditions in Australia he would thus easily
earn over 20s. per da3 T . Yet cotton growing is the busi-
ness above all others which the Tory, who loves any labor
but white, was quite sure demanded something cheap and
nasty and colored.

“ Stony ” : America’s mail-order firms, referred
to in B. 23/4’/08, provide Australia with a bunch of stun-
ning object-lessons in the distribution of commodities.
Why, asks Emily, should one pay Hobson, Choice and
Co.'ss. lid. for one’s gloves when they can be got at
Fluffem’s for ss. 6d. ? And why should Emily waste time
between shops when she can buy gloves at the Government
stores, all the year round, for a fixed price, 3s. 9d. ? We
haven’t any Government stores ? No, but we could do
worse than start them. The big American mail-order
houses (which, in our case, might be State stores) succeed
in business by supplying goods below shop-window
prices. They have no shop-windows, and no shop-
walkers, and waste no time in being polite, except
in cold type or typewriting. They sell their goods
as cheaply as possible, and keep their customers ; and
their motto is “ One price only, and one price all the year
round if possible.” Writer has had mail-order dealings,
while in the U.S.A., with Sears, of Chicago, and found
the transactions satisfactory all through. If .your gloves
split when you pub them on, or don’t fit, or are the wrong
color, you send them back, and the firm pays the carriage
both ways and refunds your cash. It then probably gets
vour custom when you want a sewing machine. Would
Hobson, Choice and Co., with no State stores to keep
them in check, be as kind as this? If the State were in
the game on these lines, and ignored the order for a hun-
dred dozen of the gloves at Is. 9d. (which might be
Fluffern’s order), and dealt at first in simple, standardised
necessities like spuds and towels and tinned meats and
socks and so forth, it would be doing something for the
mass of middle-class toilers who have bought Hobson his
big house at Malvern, and Choice his bunch of broad acres
in the Western District, and taken most of Fluffern’s ances-
tral goldware out of pawn. ‘ Those who wished to go and
be robbed by the private stores could still do so.

“Silica”: “Kodak’s” uncertainty, when he
went to court (B. 2/7/’08), as to whether Bop Yang
isn’t Hip Yah, and his mystification as to the identity of
Ling Hap and Lue Tong, who might have been the same
Chow if they weren’t Ah Yin, reminds me of an old Queens-
land bailiff. When he has to serve a summons on Con-
fucius, he goes to the nearest Chow warren and serves it
on the first Chow he meets. This may be Confucius, but
mostly it isn’t. Then the bailiff goes contentedly home,
counts up his mileage, and confidently awaits develop-
ments. It is not given to foreign devils to understand
the workings of the Asiatic mind in the presence of a
writ, or to trace the devious path of the blue bit of paper
until it reaches Confucius, or Hip Yen, or Ah Lue, or
whoever Confucius may be when he owes money. Any-
way, on the day duly appointed Confucius, or his alias,
or his nom-de-guerre, turns up to satisfy the claim, and
the . majesty of the law is again vindicated. And the
bailiff gets an enthusiastic mileage.

“ Bundaberg”: Re the sugar octopus (B. 9/7/’OS)
and the remark about that reptile becoming so bold as to
be almost truculent. It is quite evident that some people
south do not regard the O. S. R. Co. as a monopoly. I
do. It is common talk up here that the shareholders of
it and of the bank that runs “ the small local concern ”
alluded to in your article are very good cousins, and are
working in fuli agreement. The local place is capable of
turning out 40,000 to 45,000 tons of refined sugar a year,
but is limited by agreement in order to keep up the
price of refined sugar; consequently it turns out
under 20,000 tons a year. The working people here
(Bundaberg) are the greatest sufferers, as they have
only about seven months’ work in the year at
irregular intervals. For the good of the sugar industry
the nationalisation of the refining business is about the
simplest plan ; the expansion of the sugar industry could
then follow legitimately. Under present conditions Aus-
tralian refined sugar is dumped on foreign markets, some-
times even at a slight loss, to keep up prices here to an
artificial level. So the consuming industries (jam-making,
confectionery, etc.) are crippled by the high price of
refined sugar —and all to maintain a regular 15 per cent,
dividend on the C. S. R. Co.’s capita), which keeps ex-
panding like a balloon.
THE CAREFUL MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a burly man of means,
With anger in his eye
He stood, his pockets full of beans,
And watched the trams go by.
He was a man of means, with stacks
Of oof and splosh and gilt;
From good, selected greys and blacks
His well-cut clothes were built.
In wrath he watched the trams go through
To Carlton and Prahran ;
He stood alone, an angry, blue,
Soured, solitary man.
And still the trams went lounging past
With room for more than he,
And still he stared up-street, and fast
The dark came, stealthily.
At last, with rage that scored his brow,
He blessed the whole earth: “Damn!”
He said, “ I’ve waited ages now
For that cheap workman’s tram ! ”

BAD BREATH.
The Tongue is the Index.
Your breath is foul, but you do not perceive it
yourself. You are like a person who is always
among the oils and varnishes—you get used to
what is to many people a most obnoxious smell.
It is most disagreeable to those with whom you
come in contract. A slight headache, a bad
breath, and a coated tongue are the first symptoms
of stomachic disease. Take time by the forelock,
and intercept germination ; arrest the germs ere
they develop into disease. A pill in time may
save days of suffering. Look at your tongue m
the looking glass every night and morning, and if
it is at all discolored take a couple of Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills. They will remove the objection-
able matter from the stomach, regulate the system,
and sweeten the breath. One or two of these pills,
taken once or twice a week, will ensure a well-
regulated system, fortified against all disease.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching
remedy, and are a permanent and positive remedy
for biliousness, indigestion, constipation, bad
breath, headaches, sallow complexion, liver and
kidney troubles, piles, pimples and blotches, and
for all female ailments.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Marylebone Club having duly eaten the
leek, the Australian Board of Control has accepted its-in-
vitation to send a team to England next season. Which
seems almost a pity. What is sauce for Marylebone is
dressing for the Board of Control, and it is a thousand
pities that the Board did not demand a guarantee of
£lO,OOO, as England did on its last visit. However, it is
too late to discuss that now, and there are g'ood reasons
why it should not have done so. Next time it may be in
a position to drop that little thunderbolt on Marylebone’s
toes. But one tiling should be discussed right away, and
that is the abolition of the ridiculous system under which
the players go home to pocket all the profits, secure in
the knowledge that any deficit will have to be made good
by the Board of Control. The next team should go home
under terms by which each man will receive a stated sum
for loss of time, and all profits above actual costs and
expense should go to the Board of Control.
The only people who really benefited by the visit
of the last XI. to Australia were the Marylebone Club,
the grounds trustees and the players. The total takings,
excluding matches against Tasmania and Queensland,
which resulted in dead loss, anyhow, were £19,496 18s. 2d.
The Marylebone Club grabbed £lO,OOO, Melbourne Ground
got away with £1283 11s. 6d., Sydney Cricket Ground
mopped up £1526 9s. 6d., other grounds £297 3s. lOd.—a
total of £3107 4s. lOd. The players made away with £2387
2s. 5d., and in the end all the Board had to divide among
the various associations was £2244 7s. 6d., or £142145. lid.
less than the blessed players received. • Which hardly
seems a fair deal.
Several things require reforming very badly.
To begin with, the ground charges in the case of Sydney
and Melbourne are downright extortion, for the £3107
does not represent all they got out of the deal. Take the
case of Sydney ground : In consequence of the visit of the
English XI. the membership jumped from 2608 in 1907, to
2970 in ’OB, an increase of 362 members. Each of these
paid £3 3s. entrance-fee, and £2 2s. annual fee, which
meant £l9OO 10s. revenue for that year alone, and a
regular income of £760 per annum each year afterwards.
In addition to this, the ground members got all their fun
for nothing, and the Board of Control never got a six-
pence for the 2970 members who, no doubt, loaned their
tickets to members of their families when they didn’t go
themselves.
Considering that, with the exception of the five
Tests, the Australians were playing in their own cities,
and living at home the while, £2387 seems an enormous
sum for amateurs to draw for loss of time. If it were cut
to one half it would still be too large. If the Board had
its own grounds it could afford to pay players these fancy
prices ; but it hasn’t, and the players of the future will
have to be content with a lot less than £25 per match
and expenses. If it got the profits from a few good
English tours, the Board might manage to get together a
fund out of which, in time, it could construct its own
grounds, and bring the hungry trustees of Sydney and
Melbourne Cricket and Metropolitan grounds to accept a
reasonable price for Grade and International and Inter-
state matches.
On Wednesday last week a person named Bill
arrived in Sydney, and was welcomed home at Bateman’s
Hotel by a huge and enthusiastic crowd, which drank his
health with a three times three ; while the O’Sullivan,
the Eoley, and other great men said charming things
about him, and Colonel Ryrie swore he was the sort of
man we wanted to defend the hearths and homes.
Squires, though hard and rugged, did not look as though
he possessed the abounding health that makes the
perfect boxer. He was quiet, and quite unexcited
by the wild applause and the vociferous welcome,
and contented himself by saying that since he had gone
abroad he had learned many things. He hoped the better
man would win on the 24th, and lie devoutly hoped to be
the better man. All that he could do to make himself so
would be done, and he was confident that if he did not
win he would give Burns the fight of his life. He had
never enjoyed g'ood health while abroad, but now, hack in
his native climate, he was feeling fit to put up the scrim-
mage of his existence.
On Tuesday last Tommy Burns arrived to find
an enthusiastic crowd, including Squires, awaiting him
at the same place. That well-known sporting scribe,
VV. F. Corbett, made an interesting speech, in which he
demonstrated that Burns was the first man for many
years who could legitimately claim the title of Champion
of the World. He had beaten the champions of
England, Ireland, and Australia, and was, by deed
and laurels won, a champion of champions. In
appearance Burns is a heavy-weight replica of
Napoleon in face and figure. The likeness is
startling. His width is tremendous, especially in pro-
portion to his height, for he is a short man. His hitting
power must also be tremendous, for both legs and arms
show great muscular development, and taper beautifully,
his hands being unusually small. Sartorially, he was not
beautiful on the day of his arrival, wearing a fawn over-
coat with a velvet collar of the chameleon-like tint that
usually accompanies fawn. Horrible to relate, he wore a
little round hat of green plush, and the effect was
grotesque. He spoke in a low, decisive manner, and very
much to the point. And while the speakers followed one
another and assured the sardine-like crowd they were
real glad and very happy to be there that day, he looked
somewhat bored. Nobody could be really sad at being
there that day, for the Mclntosh had laid on the best
brand of champagne, and unlimited quantities of it.
Having gazed upon Burns in the flesh and
regarded Squires in the bone, writer does not see how
Squires can win. Burns’ hitting power must be tre-
mendous, and to be struck by that fist is to collide with
the sharp point of a wedge. And, provided the body
behind the arm and fist that make the wedge is in con-
dition, a long good-night to Boshter Bill.
* * * *
“Silas”: Tommy Burns plumes himself on the
amount of boxing he has done during the last 12
months, but Tommy’s record is far behind that of Bill
Lang, who just about reached the possible with 11
battles in 11 months. Lang, once a Broken Hill miner,
came to Melbourne, about three years ago, with a little
knowledge of the game and heaps of grit. He came to
make his fortune, and, being of the type of boxer that
doesn’t squander the beans monkeying with strong
drink and other weaknesses, he is in a fair way to
arrive. He is now something of a capitalist, atl< ‘ , ls
partner in a profitable biz. Squires, Cripps, Ed. Wil-
liams, Frank Thorn, and two or three others demon-
strate that the game pays with judicious economy and
careful avoidance of liquor and lures, even if you are
not a 30,000d01. champion.

Judging by its first appearances in Sydney, the
'Anglo-Welsh Rugby team has acquired all tfie objection-
able points of Maoriland play and added them to its own ;
and its own do not seem to be conspicuous by rarity.
The one redeeming feature of the team’s display was the
line kicking. Its accent is classic English, and beautiful
to hear, and the richness thereof attracts attention to
the spectacle of certain young men in evening dress,
without hats or caps, chasing Florence the Smiler down
the dark recesses of Phillip-street. One thing that can be
said in favor of the rackety section of the team is that
it’s not hypocritical. It doesn’t care a-hang who sees it
chasin'? Flossie down the street. The absence of head-
gear at nights suggests that some of the team were
originally Blueeoat boys, who go naked on the head at
all times.
In both Wednesday and Saturday matches the
Waters were up against the fact that they were
meeting a team that had played together for a consider-
able time, and which the hard boot of the Maorilander
had kicked into one solid lump, so to speak. It was a
machine, and apart from its pointing and trickery, which
usually got it penalised more than anything else, it was
far and away the better team. On Wednesday the ground
was filthy ; on Saturday it was obscene. In a quagmire
of slush the teams struggled, and although on Wednesday
the British team won b.v only three to nil, it had all
the best of the mud-larking. On Saturday the awful
ground was impossible to the Children of the Sun,
and though, of course, the Sons of the Fog were-more at
home in it, they did not find it to their liking. The line
kicking of the British, under the circumstances, was
superb, mystic, wonderful. The N. S. Wales team played
gamely, but in football as in war, pluck without skill is
a useless thing. Any fool can be game ; and a coward
who knotvs the businessis often better than thegamestman
who ever lived. The Cornstalk team had no combina-
tion and mighty little generalship. The other crowd had
both, and the figures were eight to nil. The First Aus-
tralian Rugby Team left Sydney for Britain ori Saturday
last.

David Leslie’s description of a good Covenanter
was to the effect that he was one could
sit out on a wet hillside for four hours listening
to a sermon on predestination. Something of the
sort defines vour real dyed-in-the-wool football en-
thusiast., and'when 25,000 of these dour beings were
gathered together at Sydney Cricket Ground to watch
the Anglo-Welsh team roll the N.S.W. men in the bog,
there were not many left for the League’s various dis-
plays. The Agricultural Ground, the League’s battle-
field, was in just as horrible a state as the Cricket
Ground, and had not nearly so much shelter. So
the resumption of the League’s first-grade matches was
a monetary frost. Eastern Suburbs, minus Messenger,
fell on the struggling men from Western Suburbs and
smothered them. It was a swim-away match, East win-
ning by 24 points to two. And what a mud frolic it was .
Qne pool on the ground was fully 18in. deep, but in spite
of the horrible conditions the Eastern backs got off
several passing charges that crumpled the Western men
right up, and left what spectators there were filled with
amazement. At, Wentworth Park, South Sydney and
Newcastle got swamped in turn. The Southern forwards
were a tough crowd, and, with their eyes glued on the
ball, swam and splashed for it every time. It was the
fixed resolve to be always on the ball that decided
the day; but there was not so much difference
between the teams, South winning only by eight
points to three. Two matches were played at
Birchgrove, in the earlier of wdiich North Sydney drowned
Newtown by 21 points to nil; and, in the second, Balmain
downed Glebe by ten points to five.
Eastern Suburbs and South Sydney are still in
the front rank with 18 points each. South Sydney is in
second place with 16 ; North Sydney, 14 ; and Newcastle,
10. Below that is the limbo of single figures inhabited
by Balmain, Newtown, Cumberland, and Western
Suburbs.

It doesn’t look as though doubt and uncertainty
would be eliminated from the Vic. League position till
the last game of the round is concluded on September 5.
As thing's stand, the winner of the South v. ’Wood game
on that date is a certainty for fourth place in the semi-
finals, provided neither loses the intervening game next
Saturday ; but if one of them does, and either Melbourne
or ’Varsity can win both its games, the question will
have to be decided on averages—points scored for and
against through the season. Also, if St. Hilda isass
enough to lose both its games it may likewise be outed by
any one of the four clubs mentioned. The probable outcome
of the uproar will be that Carlton and Essendon will battle
out the final game ; but a still more likely happening
is that some “unexpected reversals” will supervene,
and the man who bets on a certainty will fall in the mud
as usual, the other fellow remarking, also as usual, I
told you so ; I knew when the season started they’d be
in the final.” At present, the pubs are full of useless dis-
cussion. On Saturday, Melbourne collided with Essendon,
but the lopsided and switchbacked team from the M.C.C.
w'as on one of its descending grades, and its performance
was painful and saddening to a degree. The ’Dons made
119 points to 59. Richmond—which had just beaten
’Wood, after going under to Geelong—encountered
South. “Skinner’s Hirelings” recollected that their
final chance might come to a matter of points, so they
piled them on regardless of Richmond’s lacerated feel-
ings, 120 to 28 being on the board when the bell closed
the disaster. ’Varsity, having successively walloped
Saints, South and Melbourne, proceeded to Fitzroy full
of hope and cocksureness. Playing steadily and con-
certedly, the students forged ahead, till at half-time
they had 10 goals 7 behinds to credit against
’Roy’s 6 goals 5 behinds; but after the inter-
val' they acted as if they had been doped or
niozzed or something ; likewise their skill vanished and
their science evaporated—even as Willie Kelly evaporates
when breathed on by Bill Lyne—while the hopeless but
determined Maroons bogged in ever more and more
strongly. At three-quarter time, the ’Varsity tally was
11 goals 7 behinds ; ’Roy’s, 8 goals 10 behinds. A strenu-
ous rush or two in the last quarter would have saved them
the game ; even a strong defence might have availed;
but paralysis seized the Students and they plunged
around to' no earthly purpose while ’Roy added 5 goals
6 behinds. The Students left the field with 73 points to
’Roy’s 94 ; and behind them, to all practical purposes, lay
their semi-final hopes in this their first League season.
The already-outed Geelong club spelled six of its best
men in the game against Carlton, and the youngsters
who replaced them put up a fight that, aided by Carl-
ton’s perverted- kicking, left them, only 10 points in
default—39 to 49. There is a large-sized moral
herein for Geelong’s committee, if it will but digest it.
The heftiest engagement of the day was fought at Col-
lingwood, where the Magpies, knowing that they had to
beat Saints, put up an exhibition of determined play that
compelled a victory, though they lost two good men in
the process. Up to half-time the organised, concerted
play of the middle-weights held its own comfortably
against the strenuous rushing of the hefty holy men ;
after that the latter took advantage of a weak umpire,
disregarded the rule as to holding the ball, and charged
their opponents deliberately. Naturally, the latter
followed suit, and an uproarious and unmannerly finish
ensued, with players being rushed and slung regardless.
Still the concerted play triumphed,’Wood finishing with
70 points to St. Hilda’s 51.

The chief Association struggle was between
Brunswick and Brighton, at Brunswick, whither Bent
was inveigled to bellow for his suburb and have borak
poked at him when it lost the day. The brickies knew
that defeat meant the loss of their semi-final chances, so
they played steadily, without haste and without waste,
while Bent’s constituents toiled for all they were
worth, with the knowledge that if they could beat their
opponents and Prahran next week, they might even yet
bring more glory to the suburb than Thomas himself.
But, like the rage of the heathen, their bogging-in availed
them nought. Brunswick won bv 61 points to 48. That
team has but to beat the fearsome Ports next Saturday
to reach the semi-final or the cemetery. Ports
would as soon send it to one destination as the other.
Prahran, which still.has a chance of joining the elect
four, beat Preston by 78 to 50. Footscra.v thrashed the
subdued and discredited Ports by 77 to 44; ’Town beat
Northcote by 88 to 62, and Essendon put up a neat little
124 points to North’s 44.
During the week the Vic. Association considered
the episode of the previous Saturday, when the Port-
Brighton collision became a battle, and a Port player
peeled off his jersey and incited the whole Brighton team
to come on and be stoushed, and when the umpire was
laid out with a woodener on the jaw. Having pondered
the matter diligently the Ass. opined that certain irregu-
larities had transpired and that the suspension of three
Port players—two till Oct., ’O9, and one till June, ’lO
—would express its disapproval. Also it censured
a Port delegate for having, at a previous match,
denounced another umpire and sooled the players on
to him. The Port delegates were much aggrieved
at these decisions, and remarked that the club
mio-ht as well be out of the Association, and this
paper is inclined to agree with them. Remembering
their last season’s capers, when their ground had to be
disqualified because it was unsafe for a civilised team to
play there and recollecting the fact that many times
extra police have had to be laid on to curb the exuber-
ance of the Port barrackers, and keeping in mind the
disgraceful conduct of these latest Port ruffians and the
charming courtesy of the above-mentioned delegates, this
paper can only express its surprise that the Asso- <
ciation didn’t fire the whole lot of Ports out there
and then; and if there were any way of
wiping the club out of existence, the earth would be
the sweeter and tidier for its departure. As for the
pluckv individual who smote the umpire from behind the
door when he wasn’t looking, the Ass., finding that he
was merely a Port barracker who had inserted himself
where he had no business, instructed its officers to have
him pros'ecuted as speedily as might be. Just here, this
paper would point out to Port’s committee that, if its
professions of sportsmanship were genuine, or if it had
any self-respect at all, it would have served a summons
on this precious supporter before the Ass. got a chance to
interfere. Its failure to do so is another reason why it
should be bundled out of decent people’s society. '

Sundry lusty youths from assorted patches of the
Commonwealth, but now dwelling w'ithin hearing of
Bent’s bell w, have formed eight Soccer clubs, and pur-
pose indulging in that pleasing pastime for a few weeks.
Certainly thev have commenced the ’season at - the
eleventh hour,“in a manner of speaking ; also their road
to popularity is beset with thorns and studded with blue
metal, as it were ; still, many an undertaking has been
started with a more hopeless outlook, and hasn’t reached
oblivion half as soon as it might have.
* * * *
“Maori Mac’’ : Rugby, as played in parts of
Maoriland, is a fearsome game—for the players. For the
spectators it is Thrill —joyous Thrill. To see a crowd of
hardened barrackers speculating as to whether an injured
combatant has received a fractured skull or merely had
an ear torn off, what time the doctor, who invariably
lights a cigarette, ambles placidly over the field, is not a
sight for the gods. The Melrose team has won the Wel-
lington championship this season per medium of seven
good boosters and a “ kiyer out.”. The latter is a star
artist in his line. The crowd looks to him to supply the
Thrill, and he does it. His duties are comparatively
simple. Following close up to the charging forwards, he
springs on an opponent who -has just lost the ball. His
favorite tackle is left arm round neck, right hand across
face. When the opponent is on the ground a well-pro-
pelled boot does the rest. The referee, with one eye on
the ball, and t’other on the seven charging forwards, fails
to observe the “layer-out.” The Melrose team has had
two men put off the field in a fortnight, but the “ layer-
out ” was not one of them. This individual cut short the
career of Thompson, Maoriland’s crack three-quarter, a
few weeks since, and now McLeod, Wellington’s rep. five-
eighoh, has fallen a victim. The latter’s “ accident ” was a
gouge, pure and simple, and he was lucky not to lose an
eye. Harding, captain of the Anglo-Welshmen, after
witnessing Melrose defeat Oriental, inquired what the
Rugby death-rate was in Wellington. But the crowd
gets its Thrill, and the Union the sixpences. And for the
players—-there’s the ambulance.
•» * * *
Giltinan, of the League, showed conclusively
that he had none of the fine old crusted port qualities of
sport about him by his action towards the Maoris. He
declared that any League members taking part in a bene-
fit match to these unfortunate players would be called
on to the carpet and probably sent out for life. Natur-
ally, the Union players cut in and gave the straight tip
that men who took part in such a match, even if they
played w'ith League men, would not be penalised. And
thereby they scored heavily on the point of Giltinan.
The most interesting feature of the recent fifth
annual motor regatta of the International Sporting Club
at Monaco was the show of hydroplanes. It did not in-
crease the general knowledge of hydroplanes very much,
but it demonstrated again that in proportion to engine-
power the fastest speed is attained with the hydroplane
hull. The fastest hydro at the meeting was the French
Rapiere 111., a 26ft. 100-h.p. Tellier boat, which made 28’I
nautical miles per hour. Greater speeds have been
attained by smaller powered boats, but they have all
been accomplished on the smooth water of canals and
lakes, whereas the racing at Monaco was in the open bay
with a jobble and quite a fresh breeze. The spectacle
was cheerful, the boats fairly jumping from wave crest to
wave crest, and being entirely out of water at times.
From the front the view' suggested a number of enor-
mous fiat stones playing “ducks and drakes” along the
surface. Previously it had been commonly held that a
hydroplane w'ould be quite unmanageable in rough water,
but the regatta demonstrated that, although wind and
sea reduce their speed, they do not put them out of com-
mission.
The most disquieting lesson of the gathering
was the destruction by fire during a practice run of the
Italian champion, Fiat-Gallinari. Hitherto it has been
fondly believed that there is no danger of fire on a motor-
boat, and that explosions were impossible. The experi-
ence of the Italian boat suggests that, there are circum-
stances under which both are possible. This disaster
completely eliminated Italy from the star events, and
left England and France to fight it out between them.
The gems of the fleet were as follows
No. of
Boat. L.O.A. Engine. H.P. Oyl.
Wolseley-Siddeley.. 40ft. Wolseley 400 16 Twin-screw
Panhard-Levassor.. 49ft. Panhard 475 16 Twin-screw
Fiat-Gallinari .. 52ft. Fiat 450 12 Twin-screw
Grand Trefle .. 40ft. Brasier 390 12 Triple-screw
The English boat was unable to start in the Champion-
ship of the Sea race, the 200 kilometre star event, owing
to clutch troubles, and the Panhard-Levassor won easily
at a speed of 33 nautical miles per hour for 107 - 92 nauti-
cal miles. The winner of this event was defeated by the
Wolseley-Siddeley in the Prix de Monte Carlo 50 metres
race by 2min. 13sec., travelling at the rate of 28'19 miles
per hour. A curious thing was that the Panhard-Levassor
gained 300yds. in the starting jump, but the British boat
overhauled the Frenchman and won easily, so apparently
the Frenchman never got near his speed in the Champion-
ship of the Sea. However, in the Mile and Kilometre
events the French boat won, and in spite of the Prix de
Monte Carlo event the general opinion was that the
French boat was in reality the faster of the two, the
difference of 9ft. in their lengths giving the French boat
greater stability in rough water. Last Saturday the
Wolseley-Siddeley met the Yankees for the Harmsworth
Cup at Huntington Bay, Long Island, U.S.A.
* * * *
It is said that the Yankees who drove the
Thomas car on the Round-the-World race will claim first
place on the ground that they should be credited with
the 17 days they gained on other competitors while cross-
ing the States, and which they afterwards lost roaming
through Alaska after that territory had been cut out of
the contest. What other countries thought of the per-
formances of the Thomas people is indicated by the fact
that its proprietors received shoals of threatening letters
promising that the car would be blown up or otherwise
disposed of while crossing Siberia. The Thomas people
communicated with St. Petersburg, which ordered special
protection to be given while the car crossed Siberia. The
Russian Government’s guarantee didn’t count for much,
though—of late it has been unable to drive a cart with
treasure in it through one of its own big cities without
being bushranged by its own subjects; but as the car got
through safely, the threats were probably a mere expres-
sion of disgust for the unsportsmanlike methods of the
Americans.
* * * *
The hog in the car is in for a frosty time as far
as Great Britain is concerned, for the almost almighty
British Automobile Club has ukased that he is to be
killed off. And it has followed up the ukase with the
appointment of scouts in places where road-hoggism is
common. These men will give the police all possible
assistance to identify and punish road hogs, and will
supply the club with the numbers of the cars and photo-
graphs of the drivers. Members of the club who are
proved to be hogs will be requested to resign when two
complaints have been lodged and proved by the club’s
own scouts, or on the second conviction by the police.
If they decline to resign, the official boot will be applied,
and a man who has been expelled by the Automobile
Club will be a motor Ishmaelite, against whom any man’s
word will be taken. Men who are not members of the
club will be reported to any club to which they do belong,
or to their employers, and the employers will be reminded
of the danger of furious driving. The Auto. Club of
Great Britain is a sensible sort of association, with heaps
of influence and tons of money. Also, it is patriotic, and
insists that men who drive cars for payment are
“ motormen ” and not “ chauffeurs,” and in many of its
contests special prizes are given for cars built in British
factories.

So far Thorougligood has not accepted Pearce’s
challenge to scull over the Parramatta course for £lOO
a-side and the championship of Australia. He has to
consult his backers, and a meeting was to be held .on
Wednesday night, after this issue had gone to press.
Thorougligood himself is willing, but is said to favor the
Hunter River course opposite Raymond Terrace. Unfor-
tunately the Terrace course is never a good one for gate,
and the increased takings on the Parramatta River will
probably induce Thoroughgood to row in strange water.
It should be a splendid race, if it comes off.
Champion Webb is now pronounced to be as
sound as a bell, and quite recovered from the recent
attack of pleurisy. At time of writing, he had not re-
sumed rowing, and, realising that Arnst is a very devil to
pull, he will take no risks. There are still nearly four
months to go before the date of the race, and he will not
resume training till the weather has improved and the
cold, dreary wind that sweeps down the Wanganui River
in the winter months has subsided somewhat.
Five horses out of 16 starters finished the four
miles of big Steeplechase at Caulfield last Saturday. Two
or three others ran off the track in sheer disgust at being
expected to jump so often in so long a journey. Butithe
remainder mostly fell, and two of them —Cardinal land
Maine —were so broken down that they had to be mur-
dered soon afterwards in the name of humanity. Car-
dinal’s previous appearance in public had been his Grand .
National victory at Flemington—and this W'as the end of
him. Nigel, who was led to the course (like Lazarus)
covered with bandages, but full of condition as the result
proved, won the race by 15 lengths ; therefore he may be
reasonably expected to suffer a fatal accident next time
he goes for a big steeplechase. In these hotly-contested
long-distance jumping races the winner of to-day is the
corpse of to-morrow.
On August 22nd a Victorian hockey team will
meet a N.S.W. XI. in an inter-State match. The N.S.W.
team, with the exception of the 11th man, has been
chosen, and good practice work is being carried out. On
Saturday last, in spite of the fearsome state of the ground,
the Probables and Possibles met at Rushcutters Bay and
put up a sterling game. The Possibles made a grim
attack, and met as stubborn a defence, and when the re-
pulse was complete the Probables followed up, and arriving
within shooting distance put in some pretty work which
resulted in a score. This was succeeded by a deter-
mined charge, which completely overwhelmed the Pos-
sibles, who realised that the Lord had delivered them into
the hand of their opponent. However, they took their
gruel, and once, by 7 a sudden and well-sustained charge,
broke through and smashed the egg. But that was the
end of it. Probables w'on by five goals to one, and justi-
fied the choice of the selectors. Amen!
In a final game of 2000 up for the Vic. Amateur
Billiard Championship the holder of the title—Jacoby—
was beaten bv his old opponent, Tricks, whom he de-
feated last year. Tricks, without a doubt, deserved his
victory. He is the one Vic. amateur who from time to
time displays a “ professional ” skill and accuracy in his
manipulation of the balls. In the final game he made no
break higher than 80 odd, but his form was pretty con-
sistently good, and he scored on the average 100 points to
Jacoby’s 75—a very decisive win. Seeing that play was
an advance on his previous best, the friends of Tricks
expect him to put up a good fight with the N.S.W.
champion when they meet a few weeks hence.

If the ascending generation, now in the
stickjaw and hopscotch stage, does not acquire a
better all-round geographical knowledge of Aus-
tralasia than did its fathers and mothers, it will
not be the fault of H. E. C. Robinson, compiler
of the Lady Northcote Atlas, a book which
has nothing wrong with it save the ab-
surd name. (Why not the Alfred Deakin
Atlas?) This paper feels envious when it
remembers the skimpy imported publica-
tion from which it had to glean its first knowledge
of our own continent. The old-time foreign
atlas generally tucked Australia away in a
corner of the map of Polynesia or gave
it a bare page adjacent to the back cover.
The Northcote Atlas is a large, well-printed book
of 51 pages, containing 18 maps, a concise histori-
cal introduction, and an exhaustive index. It
shows trade routes, cables, the world’s spheres of
influence, temperatures, geological formation, and
generally bristles with information regarding the
earth, air and seas in this 'part of the globe.
The employment of the clerks in the
Tramway Department in the place of strikers
during the recent Sydney trouble has annoyed the
Clerks’ Union, which claims that, in requesting
the men to do this work, the Department was
practically using coercion ; and the union is going
to have the matter brought up in Parliament. As
a matter of fact, several of the clerks refused car-
duty, and others would probably have joined them
had they dared. It is a cheerful thing to at last
see a union battling for the unfortunate clerk.
When labor demands better conditions capital
always reckons his clerical staff in with his fight-
ing forces, and strikes a happy average between
the blackleg to whom he has to pay£l a day and
the clerk to whom he probably pays £1 a week.
He doesn’t think it necessary to ask the clerk
about it; he just tells him to go out and toil.
And mostly the clerk goes out, and does his best,
and soils his clothes, and blisters his hands, and
salves his wounds with the thought that he
belongs to the capitalistic class. Which he cer-
tainly does —just as a dog belongs to its master.
The N.S.W. Cabinet has decided not to
suspend Green, the murderer of Lily Bridge at
Allandale, but it gives no reason for its decision,
so no one knows whether George Reid’s plea of
“impulsive insanity” had any weight or not.
The Full Court confirmed the sentence, so
apparently, as far as the law is concerned, “im-
pulsive insanity ” is no more a defence now than
it was when Judge Burton and the Executive
Council hanged Knatchbull in 1844, despite the
tremendous energy with which Robert Lowe
defended him.
Defence Minister Ewing looks with a dull,
suspicious eye on the proposal of 300 returned
farm-combustibles to form themselves into a body
under the title of the South African Reserve.
Why not the South African Residue, or the
African Sediment? The fictitious glamor and
glory of the African scramble departed years ago,
and it is now admitted by everybody short of a
maniac that the war was a poor, mean thing,
as wars go, and one of the most awful
botches in Britain’s long list of fights
—dog and otherwise. Yet, notwithstanding
all this, the returned contingenter—or the least
sensible portion of him—still clings desperately to
his kharkee putties and his hat that looks like a
murdered Gladstone bag, and clamors to be allowed
to parade by himself in one heap, so that man-
kind generally may know him as the trusty com-
panion of undesirables in many a hard-robbed
fowlyard. Ewing should take that benighted 300
aside and quietly explain to them that South
Africa is something they’ve got to live down, not
live up to.
In 1907, deaths in France exceeded births
by 19,920. That seems to be the beginning of
national suicide in real earnest.

WINTER WISDOM
AS APPLIED TO CHAMBERLAIN’S COUGH REMEDY.
HOW TO PREVENT
COLDS.
COMMON-SENSE ADVICE.
Habitual colds are due to an ill-kept skin on the
outside, and by dyspeptic mucous membrane on
the inside, the result of indigestion, coupled with
carelessness. Cold water, proper food, and com-
mon sense are the foundations upon which a pre-
ventive must rest. A cold sponge bath, one to
three minutes long, before breakfast, with a brisk,
dry rub, is excellent—usually all that is necessary
to keep the cutaneous circulation alive, and the
skin reactive to sudden changes of temperature.
For those unaccustomed to cold water, tolerance
can be gained in three weeks’ time by the use of
water at any comfortable temperature, making it
one degree colder each day, until it can be
employed, without dread, as cold as it will run.
Sea salt may be added to the water for its stimu-
lating effect. Cold water, intelligently used, does
not steal vitality, but fosters it. It stimulates the
nerves that control the expansion and contraction
of the blood vessels, and regulates the cutaneous
circulation. One should “keep moving” when
wet or! chilly, and not stand on a street corner or
elsewhere without taking deep breath. The lungs
used in this way act as a pump, and drive the
blood along. This practice, with the others
named, will reduce to a shadow the liability of
taking cold every little while. If you should
contract a cold, get rid of it as quickly as possible,
for every cold weakens the lungs, lowers the
vitality, and paves the way for more serious
diseases. This is best accomplished by the use of
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, a preparation that
can always be depended upon, and that not only
cures the cold, but counteracts any tendency
toward pneumonia.
HACKING COUGHS
CAN BE PROMPTLY CHECKED.
For Hacking Coughs—the kind that almost tear
you to pieces—that make your head ache —your
throat and lungs sore and inflamed—take
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. For Hacking
Coughs that rob you of your sleep till your system
becomes so run down that you are in grave danger
of Pneumonia and Consumption, take Chamber-
lain’s Cough Remedy, and be quickly cured. It
soothes and heals the inflamed air passages, stops
the tickling in the throat, and by its tonic effect
enables you to throw off the disease. Every
bottle of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is guaran-
teed to give immediate relief, and cure your cough.
THE CHILD’S LIFE
AND DANGERS THAT
THREATEN.
The worst danger to which the children of
Australia are exposed is the neglected cold. If
your baby has a cold, don’t say, “It will wear
off,” and let it go at that. If your children have
the snuffles, or sore throats, or watery eyes, don’t
hesitate to take them from school from a day or
two so that you may break up the colds they have.
Every parent can add to the healthy condition of
the family and to his or her own peace of mind by
guarding against any and every kind of cold.
Generally the child does not know how it caught
cold. It may be impossible to prevent it exposing
its sensitive body to those dangers which older
persons shunt But the chances of contracting
colds can be easily diminished by a little care <rnd
forethought. If the children get colds, don’t
waste any time. Don’t trifle with a cold. This
warning should be heeded by all. The lives of
many children are sacrificed each year by
neglecting the colds which they take ; others con-
tract chronic catarrh, from which they never fully
recover. Of all the cough mixtures sold, Cham-
berlain’s Cough Remedy certainly heads the list
as the most efficacious for colds, croup and whoop-
ing cough in children, and the one remedy that
always can be depended upon to effect a speedy
cure, and that is pleasant and safe to take. This
remedy contains no opium or other harmful drug,
and may be given as confidently to a baby as to an
adult. Its great worth and merit in the treatment
of these diseases has been attested by many
thousands of mothers.
COMMON COLDS.
We claim that if catching colds could be
avoided, a long list of dangerous ailments would
never be heard of. Everyone knows that pneu-
monia and consumption originate from a cold ;
that chronic catarrh, chronic bronchitis, and all
throat and lung troubles are aggravated and
rendered more serious by each fresh attack. Do
not risk your life or take chances when you have a
cold, even though you do call it a common cold.
If taken in time, Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
will cure it before these diseases can develop.
This remedy contains no opium , morphine or other
harmful drugs , and has thirty years of reputation
back of it, gained by its cures under every
condition.
CHILD’S NEGLECTED
COLD
AND THE RESULT.
Colds are the special banes of childhood, and
often lay the foundation for the more serious
diseases of after-life. One child catches cold, and
scares its mother into hysterics by having croup in
the dead of night. Another child catches cold, and
before it has fully recovered from it, takes another
cold, and perhaps before that is over contracts a
fresh one. This succession of colds, or even the
neglect of a common cold, causes the inflammation
of the mucous membrane, which was at first acute,
to become chronic, and the doctor will tell
you that the child has chronic catarrh, from which
it will never fully recover. Another child catches
cold. Little attention is paid to it, as the child
has often had colds, and always recovered from
them ; but in this instance a stubborn cough is
developed. The parents are filled with fore-
bodings. Still another child catches cold, and
could easily have been cured by proper treatment,
but, being neglected, develops the most fatal
malady of childhood, pneumonia. The doctor is
called, and pronounces it lung fever, and if the
child is lucky enciugh to live, it has developed
weak lungs, making it susceptible to all lung
diseases. Every one of these children could have
been cured by the prompt use of Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy. A few doses of it, and the child’s
cold is gone. It counteracts any tendency of a
cold to result in pneumonia, quickly dispelling all
fear of that dangerous disease. It is also a
certain cure for croup, and has never been
known to fail. When given as soon as the
croupy cough appears, it will prevent the attack.
A medicine of such great worth and merit as
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy should be kept in
every house where there are young children.
Don’t wait till the child is sick, and then have to
send for it, but keep it on hand, ready for instant
use when needed.
Every Bottle Guaranteed.'
If you fail to get beneficial results after using
two-thirds of a bottle of
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY
according to directions, return it to your dealer,
and get your money back. It is well known for
its prompt cures of coughs, colds, and croup.
HOW COLDS ARE
CONTRACTED
AND PROPER TREATMENT. ,
A cold is always the result of undue exposure
to low temperatures. The rapid cooling of: the
surface, when not balanced by proper reaction,
produces congestion and inflammation of the
nasal and bronchial membranes. Obviously, such
an ailment is not communicable, in the ordinary
sense, from one individual to another. As the
slightest “cold ” predisposes the individual to at-
tacks of the most severe and dangerous catarrhal
affections, the necessity for its quick cure need
not be enforced. Thele facts emphasise the
necessity of extra precautionary measures
against the ordinary cold. Everyone, cannot change
his climate at will, but may make the most of
what he has at home —viz., take Chamberlain s
Cough Remedy as soon as the first indication
of the cold appears. It not Only cures a bold
quickly, but counteracts any tendency of the cold
to result in pneumonia. .This fact has.been fully
proven during the epidemics of colds and influenza
of the past few years. No case of either of these
diseases having resulted in pneumonia when this
remedy was used has ever been reported to the
manufacturers, and thousands of bottles of it are
sold every day. This shows conclusively that it
is not only the best and quickest cure for colds,
but a certain preventive of that dangerous disease,
pneumonia.
SORE THROAT.
A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.
A sore throat indicates there is some weakness
in the bronchial tubes, There is an irritation; a
feeling of some foreign substance lodged there ;
and a choking sensation is experienced. If this is
neglected it soon develops into some chronic com-
plaint. People who are troubled this way are
most susceptible to Influenza, contract Pneumonia
readily, and fall easy victims to Consumption.
You must remove this irritation, soothe and heal
the inflamed tubes. There is nothing equal to
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy for this. It gives
tone to the weakened tissues of the throat,
strengthens the bronchial tubes, and at the same
time helps build up the system. When the
throat is healthy, the influenza or consumptive
germs can obtain no foothold.
“Wyung” discourses on the Victorian police
gun:—
The Victorian police regulations insist on certain men
carrying six-shooters, and “permit ” the balance to take a
gun if they want to. There is a regulation pistol—a
VVebley. But it is out of date, and too ponderous to be
carried in a pocket, and too conspicuous to be carried
round the neck on a chain. So it is not used—except
by the mounted men, who drag it around on a hprse.
The old-fashioned “service Webley,” with its old-
fashioned spindle extractor, is part of the regulation
equipment of every trooper. But the trooper is never
required to practice with it —which may be fortunate in
some ways, but is fat-headed in others. A while ago I
backed my revolver against a Gippsland trooper’s official
“ gun.” The trooper shot first, and at the second fire his
pistol worked loose. At the third shot the extractor
worked out, and when the gun was empty several of the
parts had fallen out on the grass. Not a shot found the
target. The John said he’d get the station revolver. He
did. It was a muzzle-loading Colt, navy pattern. It
transpired that this venerable machine and its paper
cartridges form part of the armament of most country
police stations.
But even among the mounted men, with whom the
carrying of revolvers is compulsory, knowledge of the
weapons and ability to use them without calamitous
results to disinterested bystanders is not required. Under
the regulations, all watchhouses must have a service
pistol always loaded and ready for use. It is the old-
fashioned pattern aforesaid —the one that comes to pieces
on its own account. But not even the watchhouse
keeper, who has charge of it, is required to practise
shooting with it.
When any shooting has to be done by the bobby force
in Victoria, things happen. One morning a Carlton con-
stable pulled a gun on a burglar, and fired in the air by
way of a hint or suggestion. The shot got the quarry in
the leg. This was not a service revolver. It
was one of a kind generally carried by the metro-,,
politan police for three reasons—it is small, light, and
cheap. It shoots him who ought not to be shot, and
leaves unshot him who ought to be shot, and there is no
good cartridge in it. Most of the Melbourne city police
go armed with this brand of gun—price 7s. fid. Within
the last six months, four thieves have been challenged by
John, with his seven-and-sixpence worth in his hand, to
“ stand,” on pain of being shot, and each of the four has
told John, with r.he calmness of sure knowledge, to
“ shoot; away and be Not even a solitary pushite,
nowadays, is disturbed by the apparition of a John’s gun.
He continues to bash his “ cop ” whole-heartedly and with-
out concern, though citizens in the vicinity flee for shelter.
In the controversy re the ‘ ‘ oldest graduate
of Sydney University,” or medical school, no one
mentioned the fact that Matthew Harris (Syd-
ney’s famous ex-Mayor, who propounded the great
idea of disposing of garbage by sending it up in
balloons) —that Matthew Harris is a B.A. of that
seat of learning.
After long thought and much soul-wrestling
as to the present and prospective values of sympa-
thy and cash, the monopolistic Melb. Tram Co.
decided that the bird in the hand was worth more
than all that there may be in the bush, and
declined to give free tram-rides to American
fleet sailors in uniform. Its letter of refusal was
a masterpiece of snuffle. “ My directors,” wrote
Secretary Sprigg to the fleet committee, “have con-
sidered your suggestion, and I am to inform you
that they are quite unable to adopt the suggestion,
as to do so would interfere with the regular traffic
and involve great interference to the public.”
The company’s tender regard for the public—
especially the public that hangs on by the skin of
its teeth when leaving a football match-—is a
touching circumstance, and about reaches the
limit. The co also refused to carry the cadets
to Flemington free on review day, but that action
is understandable, as the average boy or youth
considers it a merit to do the eo. out of a fare,
wherefore the co. loathes the nipper.
“ First-timer ” writes :—-
A few words from the other point of view in reference
to the Victorian Indeterminate Sentences Act for con-
firmed criminals, which will shortly come into operation.
Without going- into the larger question that crime is a
disease, it strikes me that the very term “confirmed
criminal is an impeachment of the present penal sys-
tem. If any man is crank enough to prefer doing time to
working for an honest living, I reckon he is a fit subject
for examination by a pair of medicos. I have had a pro-
tracted residence at Pentridge, and I know- that 75 per
cent, of the prisoners would be only too clad to do honest
work if they could get it. Just consider the prospect
that faces a man after his first slip. Only one trade is
open to first offenders at Pentridge, and that is printing ;
all the other trades—carpentering, plumbing, woollen
manufacture, tinsmithing, brush-making, flax treatment,
etc.—are confined to old offenders. A man serves (say) a
five years’ sentence. On his discharge he is, if he is lucky,
an indifferent compositor. He may have spent the whole
time feeding a machine or sewing books. He receives £6
at the gate. It is a million to one that his former occu-
pation is closed to him from lack of references. He knows
just enough about type-setting to never get a job at it.
In effect, a man is given no chance to learn a trade till
the “system” has made a confirmed criminal of him.
The’ide'a of shutting a man up for life for being the thing
you made him is just on a par with the whole administra-
tion of the Victorian Penal Code. Surely it would pay to
give wrongdoers a chance of earning a living if only to
save the cost of maintenance. A good 60 per cent, of the
criminal class thieve from necessity, and the bulk of the
remaining 40 per cent, are just plain cranks, and should
be treated as such
As a rule, the lethargy of Victoria’s Bent
Government these days is fearful to witness. In-
deed, people marvel at the violence with which it
can remain so tired, and at the energy which
urges it to do nothing at 60 miles an hour. So'
when it does betray a little animation, and slum-
bers a little less than usual, folk can’t understand
what has disturbed the calm. On a recent Tues-
day, five dead-weary gentlemen gave notice of
intention to bring in the following hew Bills,
some time before Gabriel starts the last shriek :
(1) A Bill to amend the Mining Development
Act: (2) a Bill to regulate the use of motors ; (3)
a Bill to provide for the licensing of estate and
other agents ; (4) a Bill to.provide for the inspec-
tion of scaffolding ; (5) a Bill to amend the law
relating to moneylenders. Then five dead-weary
gentlemen resumed their fatigue, and waited
with magnificent patience for the adjournment,
which, it is suggested, ought to be abolished,
since the moving of adjournments is about the
only thing that brings members to the House at
all. They would so like to stay at home and
have their wages brought out by deaf mutes
wearing felt slippers and with their thoughts
muffled, so that the slumbers of Victoria’s chosen
legislators wouldn’t be interrupted.
Hosea Biglow’s “ pious editor,” who did
“believe in Freedom’s cause as fur away as Paris
is,” but was mighty tender to slavery at home,
has a whole-hearted follower in the Australasian...
In its affection for the big landlord and other
Tory circumstances it licks even its daily Argus ;■
but, having lately cast its eve, over the, system of'
tenant-farming along the Western line in N.,S.
Wales, it is appalled :— ' ,
A more deplorable system of land occupation it would,
be impossible to conceive. The leases were of irregular
length ; some were renewed from year to year ; others
extended over a considerable period. Where t ie latter
prevailed, farms were, as might be expected, in slightly
better trim than those under an annual tenure. But on
none did there appear anything of credit to either owner
or lessee. The leases were, as they are in a majority of
cases in this State, entirely without any arrangements
governing improvements. The aim of the landlord ap-
peared to be to get the last shilling in rent with a mini-
mum of expenditure.
Yet the same could be said ten times over about'
Victoria, which is far more shocking than N.S.W.;
in fact, the same could be said wherever the farm
is merely rented or occupied on shares. The Aus-
tralasian says the remedy is a Landlord and
Tenants Act—which wouldn’t be a remedy at all,
but only a palliative, and not very much of that.
A letter from one Mohan Singh, published
in the Bridgetown (W.A.) paper, indicates in
interesting fashion the strange, muddled view the
more or less educated nig. takes of life’s problems.
Mohan hasa grievance against a person named Mot-
tram, who supported another person, named'Young,
in the theory that Young was justified in running
a road through Mohan’s suburban block (No. 3) at
Manjimup Brook. After some desultory palaver
in disparagement of Mottram —but utterly uncon-
nected with the subject of trespass —the Asiatic
unwinds his vocabulary in very earnest. Hb
writes : —
Mr. Mottram thinks that he has a brain to work on,
but. my opinion about his brain is that it must be a weak
one, or iie does not know how to use it. He must not
think that I came down with the last shower of rain. I
am here to fight for my rights with my last penny. This
is the British rule who made the goat and tiger to drink
water from one pool. I belong to the Sikh race who
relieved Oawnpore, Lucknow and Delhi in 1857’s mu’iny,
arid kept the British flag flying over India ever since. Now
that trouble is recurring in India, this is the only race that
the British can depend upon. I am very proud of my
color, thank God. The late Queen Victoria had great
faith in. the Sikh race, and I hope that King Edward
VII. will follow his mother’s footsteps, as he promised on
Coronation Day.
Mohan’s regard for British rule, “rights” and
the laws of King Ned is academic mainly. Thus
in the last couple of years this worthy Sikh has
been haulbd before the beak to answer charges
ranging from causing a disturbance to attempt-;
ing to puncture the local publican with a meat-
carver.
Mrs.-Bridget Jones, a registered’dairy-
keeper of Kyneton (Vic.) was summoned (22/7/’08)
for keeping her, premises in a- state of unclean-
liness. According to next day’s Melbourne
Argus ’
The evidence disclosed a disgusting state of affairs. The
dairy floor was covered with muck, the dairy utensils
were filthily dirty, and the dirt could be scraped off a
table there. In a lean-to shed on one side of the dairy
was aheap of remnants of the carcases of cows that had
died. These bones, defendant told Inspector Ward, had
been under the shed for seven days. They smelt offen-
sively. In a pigsty, half a dozen pigs were feeding on
some similar offal, served to them raw, and a sheep that
had died had also been thrown in to them without having
its entrails removed. The sty was in a filthy state, and
an insanitary, evil-smelling drain was found to traverse
the yard. . .. . )
And instead of summarily condemning Bridget to
be torn asunder by wild odors, the Kyneton
Bench fined her a paltry sovereign and sent her
home to resume her evil-smelling career at the
old address.

Went through during the six months
that the eczema continued. I tried
first one remedy and then another,
only too glad to test anything that my
friends suggested. Nothing seemed to
be of the least good. I went to a doc-
tor several times and his treatment
was as ineffectual as the rest. I was
almost in despair. One day I read of
a similar case of eczema having been
cured by the Cuticura Remedies, so
I thought I would have at least one
more try to get my head and face right.
I bought the whole treatment (Cuti-
cura Soap, Ointment, and Pills) and
persevered with it for a week. By
that time the improvement was ap-
parent to anyone and the relief I felt
was great. I continued with the Cuti-
cura Remedies for about a month,
using two complete treatments, and
I can tell you candidly and heartily
that I was cured. I have occasion
to have great faith in Cuticura for skin
ailments, not only because of the great
food it has done me but because of the
enefit I know has accrued from its
use in other cases. My experience
with other remedies for eczema, and
I should think I tried them all,
enables me to appreciate Cuticura to
the full. Miss Maggie Hynes, Esker,
Kilkelly, Mayo, Feb. 13, 1907.”

The agonizing itching and burning
of the skin, as in eczema; the frightful
scaling, as in psoriasis; the loss of hair
and crusting of scalp, as in scalled
head all demand a remedy of ex-
traordinary virtues to successfully cope
with them. That Cuticura Soap, Oint-

by testimonials of remarkable cures when
many remedies and even physicians
have failed. One set is often sufficient.

PIANO PLAYER
MUSIC ROLLS
CHASE & BAKER Music Rolls
are cut on specially-tinted paper,
which is more restful to the eye
than the white in general use.
They fit all standard scale players,
but the character of the music
rolls used in a Piano Player is
of as much importance as the
durability of the player itself, and,
in some respects, even more so.
In addition to the tensile strength
and durability that are necessary,
the music roll should be arranged
and indicated in exact accordance
with the score, or the impression
produced on the mind, through the
sense of hearing, will be different
from that intended by the composer.
The CHASE & BAKER Music
Rolls are marked exactly as the
composer intended they should be
played, both as regards the
“tempo” and “expression,” and
are complete reproductions of the
original works .
They cost from 1/6 each—.

The co., with a capital of £lO,OOO and reserves as shown
above, has “ sundry creditors ” for £12,310. On the other
side, besides liquid assets (£5955), mortgages (£4575), and
property (£3125), it has “sundry debtors, £17,429.”
Apparently it borrows money to lend it out again ; and,
though the transactions may be explained (for instance,
these maj' be advances to trust estates), the position is
much too vaguely expressed. If the co. simply takes
deposits to lend them out in the ordinal way of business,
then the law shouldn’t allow it in the case of a trustee
co.—it doesn’t in Victoria. The business is profitable, as
all trustee businesses are; on capital and reserves com-
bined the profits for the past 12 months show a return of
£7 14s. 2d. per cent.

The co.’s paid capital is £15,000, and the reserves are
climbing up to the same amount. There is no doubt
about these reserves either, as there is about those of
many cos. : £lBOO is in advances (mortgages) and £2200
in premises, etc., but all the rest is represented by public
securities or cash. The estates in hand are valued at
£1,341,899, as against £1,098,331 in June, 1905, so busi-
ness is not skrinking. The income for the half-year was
£3746; allowing 4 per cent, to have been earned by in-
vestments, the commissions were at the rate of 9s. lOd.
per cent, of trust estates per annum, of which a shade
more than half goes in the co.’s expenses, leaving the
balance as profit. These and other trustee cos. are doing
an excellent service, but, based on capital invested, their
profits are very high. In this case, on capital and
reserves combined, the half-year’s profit shows a return of
£l4 11s. sd. per cent. A revision of the charges made by
these cos. seems inevitable sooner or later.

This co., like many others in the gas business, doesn’t
say what provision it makes to cover the general rust and
decay of mains, plant, etc. If a co.’s mains will last only
20years, then obviously it ought to put aside enough
profits to wipe out the cost of the mains in 20 years. If
the thains cost £lO,OOO, then £250 ought to be charged
against profits every half year, and accumulated either in
cash or (if additions are called for) in new plant, etc. If
this charge is not made—that is to say, if a co. declares
its full profit without any deduction—then that co. is
steadily using up its capital (represented by gas mains,
etc.), and is calling the capital profit, which it isn’t. Gas
cos. have, however, got into bad habits in many
places. The fact is that a few big concerns, being
afraid of possible municipal enterprise, have felt it
necessary to smother up their afEairs ; and, in N. S.
Wales and Queensland especially, the smaller cos. have
followed this bad lead, even where the same reason does
not apply. In this case one doesn’t know what (if any)
provision is made for general wear and tear ; and that is
another way of saying that the profits may or may not be
wholly genuine. Five years ago the plant, land and
buildings had a book value of £76,946 ; they are now
valued at £82,348. Thus £5402 has been spent on plant,
etc., in five years, and Charged to capital account; but
there is no way of telling whether anything, and, if any-
thing, how niuch, has been spent and provided out of
profits. In such cases it is necessary for the investor to
know more than the published accounts tell him—or
stand off. This co. has 70,000 ordinary shares fully paid to
10s., 50,000 pref. shares paid to 7s. (3s. may still be called);
also there are 80,000 unissued ordinaries. Besides, there is
£15,000 worth of 4 per cent, debentures ; but the debts
beyond that only amount to £1521. The preference
shares have a first claim to 6 per cent, and rank with
ordinaries in anything above that. Brisbane appreciates
both classes of shares as an investment, and rarely nowa-
days lets them pass below 100 per cent. premium. With
the prefs. there is always the possibility of the other 3s.
being called up to share in the high dividend. The
debentures are due in 1915.

The co. has lately taken over the small works for the
supply of the northern (Newport) end of Williamstown.
This Newport property is taken in the balance-sheet at
£5OOO. To pay for this the co. has realised its Board of
Works and other debentures (£2100), and has turned a
credit balance of £869 into an overdraft of £2ol6—before
payment of dividend in each case. The co., in common
with most Victorian gas-suppliers, publishes ample manu-
facturing and profit and loss accounts, so that people may
know just what has been spent on repairs and renewals,
and what also has been charged against revenue to cover
depreciation (shown above as written off). Plant, mains
and meters, apart from the Newport purchase, represent
£25,129 ; so that the amount written off is about 2J per
cent, per annum. The co. has had a long and prosperous
career, and looks as though it were carefully handled.

An enterprising Victorian has found pearls in
some of the mussels that pervade certain Gippsland
creeks. There is nothing new about the mussel pearl,
but some of those shown to Premier Bent are valued
at £5 apiece, which makes them worth hunting. The
discoverer would not have bothered to cast his pearls
before Bent; only he doesn’t seem to be able to acquire
any right; title or lease of the locality of the find, and he
wants Thomas to help him to a reward claim or some-
thing similar. The Mines Department says its jurisdic-
tion doesn’t extend to sea-going minerals or to those
that dwell in fresh waters ; and the State Rivers and
Waters Commission offers to sell the prospector a lot of
water at a cheap rate, but can give him no right to the
fish found therein. Possibly Bent might proclaim the
pearl-mussel a “ thistle,” and appoint the pearler a bailiff
over the district of his discovery, with sole authority to
capture the beasts wherever found. Anyhow, it is a
pleasing discovery, and goes to show that Socialistic
legislation hasn’t yet driven all the gems out of the
country, though on account of Bent’s roaring some of
them have taken to the water.

JUST think wliat it would mean to your family if
you could bring home to them the stars of the
musical firmament. How it would keep them enter-
tained and give them an education unobtainable
by any other means.
There is such a variety in the genuine Edison
Gold-Moulded Records, that it is a simple matter to
select items particularly suitable for young people,
and give them a really goos time.
You can make home the most attractive spot on
earth w r ith an Edison Phonograph, which will produce
anything from a coon song to a sparkling operatic
selection. It’s a wise investment for all parents to
purchase one of these admirable entertainers.
Perhaps you think the Edison is a rasping, squeaky instrument
that gets on one’s nerves. Far from it. It reproduces with a
wonderful clearness that will surprise you. If you ask us we will
forward the name and address of your nearest dealer. He will be
glad to let you hear some records on the Edison. There have
just been issued a specially good list that will appeal to you and
show what a wonderful Instrument the* Edison Phonograph is.
When you buy a machine, make sure that the name of the
inventor—Thomas A. Edison—appears on it as a guarantee of
genuineness.

NFLUENZA
LEVER HEADACHES
SYMPTOMS TO WATCH!
HE TERRIBLE ATTACKS which
Influenza makes upon the popula-
A tion from time to time are only too'
well known to enlarge upon them here.
Severe headache, extending to the eyeballs
and behind the eyes, is one of the most
marked and painful symptoms of this
insidious disease. These headaches occur
more particularly with those persons who
suffer from liver disorders and whose
bowels are frequently constipated. The
poison of Influenza seems to fasten upon
the centre of least resistance in the consti-
tution, and it is, therefore, highly essential
in every case to keep the bowels well regu-
lated, the liver active, the kidneys cleansed,
and the whole of the digestive organs in
perfect condition. This is what Kutnow’s
Powder does, and this is the reason why
Kutnow’s Powder acts as a prophylactic
in disease ; or, in other words, is a pre-
ventive of the trouble.
How to Guard Agaisist
Fraud.
The Genuine and Original Kutnow’s
Ponder can be had of all conscientious
Chemists throughout the World. See that
the fac-simile signature, “§■ KutnO'/i &.

The following circular letter, issued by the
Brisbane Telephone Exchange, is a rarity in its
way
CIRCULAR LETTER TO TELEPHONE SUBSCRIBERS.
With reference to the notice (three months’) of inten-
tion to discontinue the use of a telephone line, or exten-
sion required under the existing Telephone Regulations,
I have to inform you the question having been raised as
to the notice required from subscribers who entered into
agreements under old Regulations in which provision is
not made for such notice to be given, or which provide
that the agreements shall be terminable on the expiration
of notice less than that required by the present Regula-
tions, it has been decided that the services of all sub-
scribers under such agreements will, after the expiration
of the period covered by the agreements, be continued
only in accordance with the Telephone Regulations for
the time being in force.
A thing like that is more than a circular ; it is a
circumbendibus, or circumlocution, or whirligig
with deviations.
A Victorian in London writes of begging
as a fine art: —■
I had sampled the cadgers of Ceylon, had a rough-up
with a crowd .at Port Said that would beg the bone off a
lost dog, and fell in with the working classes of Egypt
who will run a mile to cadge a copper ; but I didn’t know
what begging was till I touched London. Possibly the
people here don’t live by begging alone, but so far nearly
all I have come in contact with have been out in pursuit
of tips. They don’t yell “Backsheesh!” at you, or
yabber “ Gib it tshillin’! ” but they get there just the
same ; and if I were an Englishman I would shut up
tight about the beggars of other countries, while
London literally swarms with people working in
scores of capacities, who are absolute beggars, and
nothing better. To see a long row of servants lined
up in the hall of a hotel waiting to touch the parting
guest, who has been robbed in the bill for everything he
has had, seen, heard, smelt, or eaten, is to appreciate the
worst phase of abject beggary. Here everybody wants a
tip, especially the porters, and particularly the police-
men. lam certain that if there is anything in the Dar-
winian theory of development, the Cockney policeman of
a few generations hence will have a third arm, growing
out of the middle of his back.
The Oldest Inhabitant maunders vaguely
about public-houses and other ancient memories :
Apropos the Star and Garter (King-street, Sydney),
which recently passed out as an inn. The house was in
the late ’forties the Hibernian printing office. William
Baker, who annually printed a sheet almanac, was the
proprietor. He was the publisher of “ Heads of the
People,” after Kenny Meadows’ style, and issued
“Charles O’Malley” in weekly or monthly parts, with
illustrations done in Sydney by a deaf and dumb man,
who was a marvellous engraver. On the other side of
the lane was the Albion printing office —T. Trood, proprie-
tor. The Star and Garter corner is owned by Mrs. Mann,
a daughter of the late Thomas Farrell, who kept a wine
and spirit store in King-street, at the rear of the now
K., S. and A. Bank. The banking house was formerly
known as the Welsh Harp, and was kept by T. Farrell’s
father, Michael Farrell, who afterwards kept the Farriers’
Arms in George-street, opposite the Royal Hotel, and next
to the farriery of William Garland. Mrs. Thomas Farrell
was, a sister of Moses Murphy, who kept the Adelphi
hotel in front of Malcolm’s amphitheatre (or circus) in
York-street, afterwards the Lyceum, and in 1880 kept by
Larry Foley. Mr. Thomas Farrell died a very rich man,
being'the owner of Petty’s hotel and a lot of city pro-
perty. Ex-Sergeant-Major Baynes, afterwards Colonel
Baynes, kept the Farriers’ Arms in the late ’fifties and
early ’sixties. The Sergeant-Major, on his retirement
from the 11th Regiment, opened a pub near the old toll-
bar on the Paddington-road, which he named the Colonel
Bloomfield hotel, after the popular commander of his
regiment. The house stood on the corner of what is now
Glenmore-road.

BRONCHITIS
CURE
The Famous Remedy for*
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, & CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
' Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful'and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where " Coughs” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “ Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, Small Size, 2/6; Large Size, 4/G. Sold by Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Forwarded to any Address, when not obtainable locally.
NOTlCE.—Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. lAdoes NOT contain any poison within the meaning of the Act. It is equally beneficial for the youngest
child and the most aged person.
BENGER’S FOOD is quite
distinct from any other. It
possesses the remarkable property
of rendering milk with which it
is mixed when used, quite easy of
digestion by Infants and Invalids.,
s
One of the most valuable foods
known to science. It gives the
body abundance of nourishment,
with complete or partial rest to
the digestive system, regulated
as may be advisable.

Nine-tenths of the principal diseases which to-day afflict the human
race have their rise in a common, ordinary little cold. The history of
most cases of disease of this character is very much the same. The cold
comes, and is neglected. It moves down from nose to throat, from throa
to bronchial tubes and lungs, and when it doesn’t end there, in consump-
tion. Its after effects are sure to weaken the kidneys, liver, and heart.
This is all accepted and taught in the medical schools of to-day. It is well
for you to remember it. An equally important fact to remember is that
the proper and only scientific treatment for a cold in any stage is Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery for Coughs and Colds. This medicine will
cure any kind of a cold or cough, and will prevent all the dangerous after-
effects of Lung and Throat Diseases. It is guaranteed to cure, or money
back. Try it.
What people say of
DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY.
Mrs. H. Phillips, Phillips’ Circus, Albury, N.S.W., writes as follows:
“ I have been using Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for some time for myself
and two little children, and find it far surpasses any other cough medicine for
children. I give it to my little ones on the least sign of a cold, and find it
always stops it from becoming serious.”
Mrs. E. G. Charlton, Durham Leads, via Buninyong, Victoria, writes as
follows :—“ I have used Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, and found it one of the
best remedies I have ever used. One bottle cured my son of a very distressing
night cough, when several other remedies failed to give him relief at all.”
DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY
is an unequalled preparation for the immediate relief and Permanent Cure
of all diseases of the THROAT, BRONCHIAL TUBES and LUNGS ;
including Bronchitis, Coughs, Colds, Influenza, Asthma, Quinsy, Sore
Throat, Hoarseness, Difficult Respiration, and Pains in the Chest. When
used according to directions, is a sure preventive of Pneumonia and
Consumption. Every Bottle Guaranteed to give Satisfaction, or Money
Refunded. If not obtainable locally, will be posted upon receipt of the
price, 1/6 and 3/«, or in larger bottles for Hospital use, 5/"» by the
SHELDON DRUG GO., LTD., 15 O’Connell Street, Sydney.

WRIGHT’S
The ORIGINAL and ONLY GENUINE
COAL TAR SOAP
6d. per Tablet.
The Voice from the Skull.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The mummy of Prince Khnumu Nekht, wrapped up
some 4400 years ago, was unrolled on May 6 in the Man-
chester University. It is the oldest mummy that has
undergone this treatment, and the result was awaited
with keen interest. . . . The mummy was swathed in
several layers of bandages in a style quite different from
that of the last mummy that was unwrapped. That was
one of the 26th dynasty. When the last bandage had
been removed, the bones crumbled into dust, with the
exception of the skull, which remained intact. News
item.
SWATHED in my grave-cloths, I slept where
the darkness was bearded and grey ;
Soft-footed centuries passed me and indo-
lent years oozed away
Until, rough-handed, ye dr: g ;ed me from dreams
of my long-vanished day.
Weary was I of the vain pomp of kings—of the
plotting and lust,
When they laid me away like a worn-out sword in
silence to rust;
Rare spices sweetened the breath of the grave
that would turn me to dust.
Every vain art of man that could keep the great
corse from decay
Guarded me well from the merciful worm I would
welcome to-day.
So, tightly bound in my wrappings, I dreamed
till e’en Time swooned away.
Lost and forgotten of devils and gods in that deep
well of night,
Sunk in the slow-flowing dreams of the dead that
are endless delight,
Thus did I dwell in the kingdom of Death safely
hid from Man’s sight.
Life is the madness the gods give to men at the
moment of birth ;
Life—the blind instinct that urges us on to our
fight with the earth,
And the fierce gods looking down on the struggle
are moved to loud mirth.
This is the truth slowly gleaned in the worlds of
the sun and the shade :
“ Strive not to fly the embrace of the earth out of
which ye are made.
Only as dust shall ye taste of true rest. Lie ye
down unafraid.”
N.S.W.
E.O’F.
The Tale of Ling Ah Too.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIS earliest distinct recollection came
from the day when he strutted out of his
home in Little Lonsdale-street and
marched, gaudy in his dress of red and green,
along Spring-street to Parliament House, batter-
ing the toy drum slung at his waist. He was a
pretty little boy, with solemn unfathomable eyes,
clear olive skin, and a frame which had taken wire
from Ah Foo and brawn from Ah Foo’s wife
Maggie. Maggie had been through many ex-
periences before she came to rest in Ah Foo’s
skinny arms, but this sturdy infant—with the
Saxon name of Cedric stolen from a novelette !
might have been the child of her first healthy
womanhood.
A fat and pompous legislator, coming down
the steps, felt his eye caught by the little blob of
gay color at his feet. This legislator believed
himself a political philosopher, being skilled in
weaving repulsive theories which gave the lie to
facts. He had just made a speech, imploring his
colleagues not to wound the tender susceptibilities
of “ Oriental” nations.
“There,” he said, striking an attitude for the
benefit of the pillars and three-ball lamp-post on
the footpath, “ is a unit of our future-soldiery.
Eastern subtlety and Anglo-Saxon pluck. Some
day, I wager, the little fellow will beat his drum
in a hotter corner than this !” The fancy pleased
him ; he glowed with appreciation of his own dip
into the future. He even paused to put a finger
under the baby’s chin. “Be a real Aus-
tralian soldier when you grow up, hey ? ” he said,
caressingly. The fingers of the other white,
jewelled hand were in his waistcoat pocket, and
Cedric Ah Foo, Australian-born citizen of the
Empire, stood with vague but unbetrayed visions
of a penny. But the legislator was not that sort.
He was feeling for a tram ticket. He found it,
and rode into the city, where he was booked to
lecture on “Naval and Military Defence ” to the
Women's Club. Cedric, though he never knew it,
earned fame instead of copper. Next day he
figured, though not by name, in three newspaper
reports. A week later he was caricatured ; then
forgotten.
He grew up all the same, going to school and
Sunday-school; an apeish semi-Australian by
day, turning into an inscrutable, unintelligible
little Chinese at night. Grown older, he learned
to play billiards with his brother half-castes at the
hotel where Melbourne’s half-castes congregated.
He developed an unceasing amorousness. There
were, some damsels who smiled upon him with
patronage which his insinuating skill was able to
turn into surrender ; others tilted scornful noses,
and audibly called him a Chow. His chubbiness of
beauty had left him, but he was still a handsome
boy. He was treated with large and friendly
tolerance in the junior cricket club, and was a
popular hero on the day when he made his cen-
tury. The legislator, now in Heaven, may have
looked at him with pride from a front seat among
the clouds. But inside the doors from which
Maggie had long since departed—in a hearse—
Cedric stepped across the gulf which splits the
world in two, while Ling Ah Foo smiled and
smoked, and talked nasally to the son he loved.
At the proper age, Cedric began his military
training along with thousands of others. They
were a mixed crew—the “flood of immigration”
had started, and strange people from Europe were
spilling excitedly into Australia. Private Cedric
Foo, among many slack and gaping drillers, was
an exemplary recruit. He shot well, marched
well, and held himself like a soldier.
At the end of his training came War.
Out of the north-west the locusts had gathered.
The swarm was devouring Queensland. In
desperate confusion, with trains breaking down,
ammunition dumped in deserts where no guns had
gone, and lost stores standing piled on forgotten
railway stations, the army went up against it.
Cedric, in obedience to proclamation, reported
himself to a regiment preparing to leave Mel-
bourne. Ling Ah Foo, weeping with fright, was
at the police-station, crying, “Me Blitish sub-
ject!” while he displayed an ancient parchment.
Armed men stood, day and night, guarding Little
Lon. from flames and murder, and Ling Ah Foo
wept afresh with every screw he dropped into the
luxurious “wedding wardrobe” he was making
to order.
* # * *
“ Gawd—spare—me—days ! ” Sergeant Wilkins
said softly, as he looked at the section under his
command. Private Foo, erect and clean, but
with a twitching mouth, stood between an overfed
Polish Jew and a slovenly Greek. “Dagoes an’
Chows ! ” the Sergeant muttered. Dave Linburn,
captain of the company, heard the murmur and
went away to swear to himself.
Everyday the newspapers were horrible with
tales from the north—massacre, pillage and
ravishment. Men and women alike were bearing
arms up there, and both were dying. The stories
of sobbing fugitives, quivering southward along
all the telegraph wires, sent the cities mad with
hate and terror. An officer watched every ten
men who stood with fixed bayonets in Little Lon.
and its lanes. Linburn went to his Colonel. He
wanted no Cedric Foo in his company. The
Colonel, precise and formal, dismissed him with a
sharp word.
Private Foo had read the newspapers—brief,
tragic stories told in tumbled w»rds by the
correspondents, whose pens hardly knew how to
dip into this molten tragedy after so many years
of placid reporting. His eyes grew dark and
sombre. With a half-conscious effort he dragged
into his brain all that was Australian in his life,
his school, his cricket, his training. But when he
spent a day on duty in Little Bourke-street, and
the heavy smell of it blew down to his nostrils, a
haze swept through his mind, and in a livid mist
there surged past his vision all the girls who had
called him Chow. He lay awake at night with an
illusion of Ling’s voice pouring monotonously in
his ears; or fell asleep to dream that he was
luxuriously slitting the throats of the men who
breathed heavily round him. At these moments
it would have been worth while to put slices of
Ah Foo’s brain under a microscope.
At last they went northward.
■*■***
Dave Linburn, officer commanding B Company,
87th Regiment, lay in a little rifle-pit scratched
out on the breast of a long hill, behind which the
railway ran down to Rockhampton. The line
was thin; here there was nothing but the skir-
mishing overflow of a battle which for days had
covered 40 miles of country. Sergeant Wil-
kins, growling and sweating, lay three yards from
his captain. Anyone walking past ten men—had
he walked that far alive—would have found Pri-
vate Cedric Foo resting quietly in another scrabble
in the ground. Near him the Pole was stretched
quaking, his rifle idle. The Greek, having found
a fold in the hill, was worming himself back-
ward and sideways, hoping desperately to hit on a
way to the other side.
In front, wherever the ground undulated, rifles
would lift themselves into view and spit a bullet
every few seconds. Cedric Foo, his barrel thrust
forward cautiously, replied with the same deadly
message. He heard the Greek, with sobbing
breath, crawl behind him.
“ Blanky coward!” muttered the son of Maggie,
and pressed his shoulder to the butt again. A
hundred rifles jerked from the earth in front.
He suddenly felt that he had taken a blow—
where he could not tell. All that he felt was a
fierce sense of outrage and hurt; a peace-destroy-
ing shock which called for murder to avenge it.
As a matter of fact, a bullet had merely flipped
through his arm. Men are wounded like this
without knowing they are hit. There was no
pain; the permanent damage was nothing; but
the bullet, as it flicked through the little
nerves, changed the whole aspect of the
universe for Cedric Ah Foo. The balance in
which his brain had swung was kicked down with
decision. His race was determined. It was an
Asiatic, longing to run amok, who looked into the
noisy air with profound, unseeing eyes. He
rose, and with his bayoneted rifle held correctly
at the charge, walked slowly along the wavy line
of prostrate men. The Pole gasped.
“Mad, by Heffen !” he whispered.
The bullets struck the ground with an infernal
clapping, but Cedric, with Ling’s voice roaring
in his ears, walked on. He came beside the cap-
tain. A bullet, having taken Linburn in the
right shoulder, was burning somewhere near his
liver. He turned as far as he was able. “Lie
down, you damned fool! ” he said, faintly.
There was the ghost of a smile on Foo’s blood-
less lips, but his eyes were expressionless. Two
or three filthy words of Chinese leapt out of his
mouth. He drew his rifle butt back and up, and
with admirable precision plunged the bayonet
between Linburn’s shoulder-blades.
The bullets spat on, and none touched the
Chinaman. But Wilkins, with a little cry like a
hurt child, swung his rifle and fired. Ah Foo
dropped, his lungs pouring blood into his mouth.
The sergeant jumped across to his captain, and
threw one arm round his neck to lift his face from
the dust.
Linburn would never speak again, but Ah Foo
spoke once. “My father,” he gurgled through
the blood that choked him. Wilkins’ muzzle
was not a foot away from Cedric’s head. He
jerked a cartridge into place, and fired again.
“ My Gawd ! if ever I find ’is father,” Wilkins
panted, and began to cry stupidly.
* * * *
But that same evening Ling Ah Foo crept be-
yond the corner of the street to buy the news-
paper which cried that the army was fighting
desperately round Rockhampton. In the morning,
a rigid, bruised old body was found staring at the
slit cut out of the sky by the walls of a narrow
lane.

KIDNEY DISEASES
Creep Quietly to the Attack. Do not Mis-
understand the Symptoms—Backache,
Tiredness, Broken Sleep, Depression,
Urinary Troubles, Pains in the Limbs.
&
V
“Every
PicturG
Tells Ob
Story.”
Bo vou know that
Rheumatism, Dropsy,
Gravel, Stone, Lum-
bago, Sciatica, are all
kidney diseases ? The
kidneys when healthy
filter the blood ; when
weak or diseased they
cannot do their work,
and the whole body
suffers. Only a special kidney medicine can cure
them. Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills are a kidney medi-
cine and a Kidney Medicine only. They keep the kidneys
well, and the kidneys will keep you well. Keglected
kidney disease is fatal.
Sydney People Cured.
A Sydney Man.
Mr. Jos. Hamon, Painter and Paperhanger, 3 Stanley Street, Sydney, says :
“At intervals during the past five years I have suffered with kidney trouble. I
had an aching back, which was particularly bad when I had any stooping to do. I
tried plasters, but they had no beneficial effect. I then procured Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and since using them have had no return of the pain ; in fact, all
trace of kidney trouble has left me.”
Eight years later Mr. Hamon says: “I was very bad with my kidneys
previous to using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, but I am very pleased to say
that this remedy cured me. I have recommended these pills to a great many
people, and they are favorably spoken of by all who use them.”
A Sydney Woman.
Mrs. E. A. Bruce, Broughton Koad, Artarmon, Sydney, says : “ I suffered for
a long time with severe pains in my back. They were so bad that I could scarcely
move about. Rest was out of the question. I would be tossing about all night,
moaning with the pain. I could not bend my back, and I had to neglect my work.
I was really very ill, and would be confined to bed for days at a time. I saw
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised as a cure for backache, and got a box.
After a few doses I got relief, and then gradually I got better, until I was quite
cured. There is no doubt about it b ung a cure, for it is two years since I stopped
taking the pills, and I’ve not had the backache all that time. I cannot tell you
how pleased I am to be free of the backache, and if sufferers will only try Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, there will be no aching backs.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all Chemists and
Storekeepers at 2/9 per box (six boxes 15/3), or will be posted on receipt
of price by Foster=McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
ECZEMA.
Nothing spoils a good disposition quicker.
Nothing taxes a man’s patience
Like any irritation of the skin ;
Piles almost drive you mad.
All day they make you miserable, all night
they keep you awake.
Just the same with Eczema. Such miseries
are daily decreasing. People are learning
they can be cured. Learning the merit of
Doan’s Ointment. Plenty of proof that
Doan’s Ointment will cure Piles, Eczema,
or any skin irritation.
Mrs. Fletcher, 81 Bellevue Street, North
Sydney, says:—“For some months I suffered
with a form of Eczema, which broke out
on my legs and arms. The irritation was
so dreadful at night that T could not sleep.
I used a great number of remedies, but none
of them gave me any ease. I commenced
to think that there was no cure for Eczema,
but a treatment of Doan’s Ointment proved
that I was wrong in this. The first appli-
cation gave me ease, and a few pots cured
me. This was two years ago, and I have
never had a sign of the ailment since. To
all who suffer with Eczema I recommend
Doan’s Ointment.” Do not neglect any sign
of skin trouble, for it is very hard to cure
and may become chronic. At the first sign
get Doan’s Ointment, the great specific for
every torturing skin irritation. Doan’s
Ointment is sold by all chemists and store-
keepers at 2/9 per pot, or will be posted on
receipt of price by Foster-McClellan Co.,
76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
But be sure you get DOAN’S. I
Some Mistakes in “The
Banner.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ T am looking for the editor,” said the
I tall, thin man, in a voice of utter sadness.
The editor of The Wild Dog Banner
pointed to the only chair in sight and said, with a
sigh, “Sit down.”
The tall, thin man carefully extracted from his
tail pocket a neatly-folded copy of that day’s
Banner, and, laying it down before the editor,
indicated the centre column, and remarked, with
a profound sigh, “ I am the writer of that article.
Would you mind casting your eye over it ? ”
The editor put on his glasses and started to
road, and the long, thin man sat down and waited
patiently for five minutes.
At the end of that period the editor looked up
and said, in a tone of deep emotion, "I am very
sorry—this is most unfortunate ! ”
“It is, sir—most unfortunate ! ”
“ I’m afraid we have caused you pain ?”
The long man smiled like a suffering martyr.
“ I must admit you have hurt me.”
The editor stroked his head in great agitation,
and glanced hurriedlyover the introduction. “You
know,” he said, “ we do our best to guard against
this sort of thing, but, do what we will , mistakes
will creep in every now and then. We take
extra precautions in the case of special articles,
such as this, and I assure you, sir, we feel as much
annoyed as the author when the thing is marred
by typographical blunders. Of course, in this
case, the mistakes are neither numerous nor very
noticeable. I may say ”
“ Allow me,” interjected the long man, leaning
over and taking the paper. The editor sat silent,
Then the author cleared his throat, and read
as follows:—“‘Childhood is the spring of Life,
and there is no more beautiful thing in the world
than a happy child. Woe to him who loves not
the sight of a babe, or for whom bright eyes
beaming With ignorance have no charm!’ You
know, my dear sir, that word should be ‘ inno-
cence,' sir— ‘innocence’ ! Eyes do not beam with
ignorance ! You know that, surely !”
The editor gazed blankly at the inkpot.
The author searched for a minute, and then
readout this: “As Shakspeare says, ‘ lmmoral
Csesar dead and turned to cla.y.’ Now, sir, I have
no recollection of writing that ! As far as I re-
member, I made no reflections on Cmsar’s charac-
ter in my article. I may have called him immor-
tal, but I certainly did not say he was * immoral.’
Can you explain it?”
“lam afraid my compositor is not a Shafcs-
pearian scholar,” the editor faltered.
“But this isn’t Shakspeare,” muttered the
author, jabbing another paragraph with his index
finger. “‘Yet, in spite of all this; in spite of
rebuffs administered by the elemental forces of
Nature, mankind has kept hopping through the
cages.’ What I said was * hoping through the ages.’
Your compositor, sir, has made that sentence
absurd ! How do you reconcile ‘hopping through
the cages’ with ‘hoping through the ages ’ ?”
“ I don’t! ” moaned the editor.
“To me,” said the author bitterly—“to me
that sentence suggests an ape playing hop-scotch
in a deserted zoo. That isn’t the effect I aimed at
at all! ”
The editor said nothing.
“ Here ! ” shouted the writer suddenly, as his
eye lit on another passage. “ Here is another of
your infernal atrocities ! Listen to this ! ‘ But
oh ! when Love awakes in the heart, this grey
old world, with its cobwebs of memory, is lighted
up by the radiant dawn of sympathy, and we are
young again. In such hours, when we hear the
magpie in the field, bawling to his mate ’ (ugh !)
‘ and the cheap sparrows ’ —cheap sparrows, sir !
‘on the fence, we are filled with’- Oh ! d—n it,
what would you be filled with if you read that 1 ”
“I don’t know,” replied the editor desperately.
“ I give you my word I don’t know ! ”
“When the manuscript left my care, the mag-
pie was ‘ calling ’! ”
“ That’s exactly what I thought !”
“And the sparrows were not ‘ cheap sparrows
on the fence.’ They were ‘ cheeping sparrows on
the fence.’ That is, they were making a row with
their beaks—or something like that.”
“ I understand ! ”
“Yes, but the way that criminal of yours has
mixed it up, it reads as if I’d bought some cheap,
stuffed sparrows and stuck ’em on the fence before
J wrote the d d thing ! ”
“ Yes—yes !”
“ Then, sir, about the magpie ! ”
“ Don’t, I beg of you ! ”
“ One moment, sir ! If you were not an Aus-
tralian, and didn’t happen to know the magpie
was a bird, what would you make out of ‘ the
magpie bawling to his mate?’ Wouldn’t you be
inclined to think it was an oysterman out for the
day, shouting like these confounded people do at
their confounded picnics ? What’s that ?”
“I say, I don’t want to hear any more! ”
“ But you shall, sir ! You shall!” Theauthor,
in a frenzy of rage, caught up the paper again,
and stood over his victim where he sat crumpled
in his chair.
“ ‘Love,’” he shouted. “ ‘Love, the great petri-
fying passion.’ (Purifying, you Goth !) ‘Csesar
victorious was acclaimed with delightful snouts.’
(Shouts, you blackguard!) ‘ Leander swimming
Hell's Pint!’ (You swilling ruffian!) ‘Those
deliciously tender verses of Edgar Allan Poe—
Cannibal Lee.’ (Great Heaven !) And here ! ”
he shouted, tearing out a handful of the page and
slamming it down on the desk with a crash, “read
that last paragraph and go and paste it on your
one-horse brain ! ‘ And, at the end, with thankful-
ness in our hearts, we turn homeward and go
where the ghosts of a million heroes are leaping' —
leaping, mind you! not sleeping! — ‘leaping in
their shrines!’ You abandoned old man!”
he hissed. “You disgrace to letters! If you
aren’t leaping at the benevolent asylum inside
three months it will be because there isn’t any
justice or decency left in the d d country ! ”
He swept up his hat and whirled out of the
room and down the stairs, and the concussion of
the front door shutting upset the inkpot over a
blistering article on “Socialism in the Home.”
The editor sat in a brown study for three
minutes. Then he opened his mouth and roared
“George !”
Instantly, there was a sound of fumbling and
scuffling overhead.
“Come on!” howled the chief, furiously.
“ Come on I Don’t be all the blanky day ! ”
Something hurled itself downstairs and clat-
tered along the corridor. The door was opened
from without, and a touzled head, with wide-open
eyes, said “Wot?”
“Look here, my friend,” said the editor, be-
tween his clenched teeth. ‘ ‘l'm going to shake this
place up ! Hitherto this has been rather a go-as-
you-please crib, but henceforth—also for ever—
I’m going to play hell with every blithering incom-
petent who makes a mess of things. Now, I want
you to tell me straight what drunken swab set
that d d article on ‘The Glory of First Love,’
in to-day’s issue. Out with it now ! ”
George scratched his head for a minute ere he
started, and directed an inky forefinger at his
respected chief.
“Wasn’t that youl” he mumbled. “ You re-
member . . . w’en we was busy . . . lars Sat’d’p /”
The editor grew suddenly purple, and hurriedly
extracted his hat from the waste-paper basket.
“George,” he remarked, feelingly, “I rely on
you as a man of discretion. On this occasion all
will be forgiven. Have one with me ! ”
They went out together as brothers. „

KODAK.
When Clubs were Trumps.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THOUGH our cavern-dwelling parent
In the days that used to be
Knew no uses for a brush and comb, or
tub.
He possessed a lot of knowledge
That is hid from you and me,
And he knew the varied uses of a club.
Though he may have been a heathen,
And a trifle rude and rough,
When we patiently investigate, we find
That, though ignorant of science
And a lot of modern stuff,
Still he knew the way to deal with womenkind.
When the prehistoric person
Wooed the prehistoric maid,
He was rigorous and rough, and often rude ;
For he hadn’t any maimers,
And, I’m very much afraid,
That his methods might be stigmatised as crude.
By the hair he used to grab her,
As she scuttled through the scrub,
And he dragged her to his cavernous retreat,
Where he ardently caressed her
With a hard and knobby club,
And the sacrament of marriage was complete.
Then the Voice that Breathed o’er Eden
Was the wailing of the bride—
Plus the diapason grunting of her hub—
As he sought the softest places
In her cuticle, or hide,
Which would take the best impressions of a
club.
So, through all the later stages
Of the cave-man’s married life,
Which could scarcely be monotonous or tame,
He evinced consummate knowledge
Of the way to treat a wife,
And he always knew the way to play the game.
In the risky game of marriage
Quite a lot of modern chumps
Lose the “doubles,” and the “singles,” and the
“rubs”
Just through thinking, in their folly,
That, in marriage, hearts are trumps,
While the cave-man always knew the trumps were
clubs.
And his wife was meek and lowly,
And she kept within the range
Of her proper sphere, as women ought to do.
And she never searched his pockets
To relieve him of his change,
For he hadn’t any pockets to go through.
She could fricasee a dodo,
She could mend a green-hide shirt
(We may take it she was never asked to scrub);
And through all her weary struggle
With the squalor and the dirt
She was heartened and encouraged—with a club.
She was spry, and she was active,
And assisted in the chase
When they had to “scratch the gravel” for their
grub;
But, however fleet the quarry,
Or however hot the pace,
Why, she always kept one eye upon the club !
If he lingered till the morning
At the prehistoric pub,
And she looked at all like laying down the law,
Well, he didn’t say, “ My darling,
They detained me at the club,”
But he just let her have it on the jaw ! O
What a sweet, domestic picture
Of the simple married life !
Free from modern complications ; for, of course,
If the club was instrumental
In the winning of a wife,
It was quite as efficacious for divorce.
When the cave-frequenting person
Had a yearning to be free
From a loving wife’s affectionate embrace,
Why, a wallop with a “ waddy”
Was an “ absolute decree,”
And there wasn’t any “nisi ” in the case !
No expensive fees to counsel,
No anxiety of mind,
As petitioners, in cases of the sort,
Feel when active co-respondents—
Leaving unpaid Costs behind—
Skip beyond the jurisdiction of the Court.
What a lot we must be missing
In decadent latter days—
’Spite the scientific lore of which we rave—
For we know far less of women,
And their management, and ways
Than the prehistoric person in the cave.
And the modern wife who waketh
When the early rooster crows,
And who findeth that her head is free from
bumps,
Ought to thank her stars (and garters)—
As the vulgar saying goes—
That she lived not in the days when clubs were
trumps.
