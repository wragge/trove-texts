The Sewage System
with no Drawbacks.
For private houses or public institutions
the one system that is free from all dis-
• ’ " tures. is the
Oxidising
(Noa-
Septic)
System
of Sewage Disposal.
It is entirely different from the Septic
system. There is no putrefaction, there-
fore no smell. The Sewage is dissolved
and given off in the form of odorless gas.
There is not the slightest suggestion of
offensive odors even on hottest days. The
Oxidising system also costs less than the
Septic. , .
Before you instal any process send tor
our interesting Booklet, and learn the
many advantages of the Oxidising Process.

THE ROUGH WRITER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is not now in Wallaroo
And all the brown land down the sweep
Of Winward Hills a rider who
Can like Rod Kyley smiling keep
The saddle while a mad horse vaults
Or throws his frantic somersaults;
But on a day in Spring he found
■A red colt by the Green Reed Spring,
And bore him down, and seized and bound
A tremulous and lovely thing.
Then while a long year held its course
He strove to break and ride the horse.
He mounted him and ventured out
In smiling- pride to sweep the field.
The red colt spun himself about
In demon whirls, and would not yield,
And like a shooting star would pass,
And leave his rider on the grass.
The man with resolution hard
Tried kicking-strap and snaffle-bit,
And with a log he spragged the pard.
The eerie creature kicked and bit,
And shooting with a comet’s vim
Scraped Kyley off beneath a limb.
A hundred times the breaker tried,
A hundred times he failed. Anon
He cut the stallion free, and cried:
“The Devil take your breed. Begone!”
The red colt fled, and curses grim
Rough-rider Kyley piled on him.
That eve was mild, and by a stream
That down the mount in silver shone
Rod Kyley saw as in a dream
A rider pass the red colt on.
Slim was the girl who rode him thus:
The horse’s name is Pegasus!

Antwerp
On summer evenings the Avenue de Key-
ser, which runs from the railway station in
the Old Town into the fashion and purse-
pride of the New Town, was very gay with
open-air cafes and music and promenading
people. Just out of the Place de Meir, in the
Rue Rubens —you can’t get away from that
man in Antwerp—Nos. 7 and 9 on the left
side have a portico and a garden-house,
which are all that is left of the fine, new
house Rubens built there in 1611. He lived
and painted pictures there for nearly 30
years; and he died there on May 30, of 1640.
In Guicciardini’s records of 1566 the imports
of Antwerp for that year are given. Of Portu-
guese spices and sugar, 1-1 million ducats; of
Italian silk and gold embroideries, 3 million
ducats; of Baltic grain, If million ducats;
or French and German wines, 2f million
ducats; of general imports from England, 12
million ducats. The ducat was 10s. Taking
money then as four times money now (which
is conservative —six times is more probably
correct), Antwerp’s imports were 41 mil-
lion pounds. For a mediaeval city of perhaps
200,000 souls, that seems quite good. The
fact is, when the mudbank blocked the
entrance to the Bruges canals, all the Euro-
pean business went to Antwerp. She was
the first port on the continent, greater than
Genoa or Venice.
In the same year of 1566 iconoclasts under
Philip 11. smashed up churches and things
generally; the Duke of Alva’s Courts of
Heresy put to death and banished-thousands
of the pious burghers. But those who could
came back and put the large Flemish hand,
quiet and stubborn, on the place again. Now
she imports (or did import about four years
and three months ago) more than 41 millions
in wheat, coffee, hops, tobacco, wool, hides,
petrol and timber; she cut diamonds, made
cigars and lace, refined sugar and brewed
good beer.
She has a combination in atmosphere of
the harsh air of Ghent and the smiling,
mediaeval reticence of Bruges. The Old Town
keeps up the quiet recluse end, with the Hotel
de Ville’s cobweb stone tracery (some prince
whose name I forget said, when he saw the
Town . Hall, that he knew now whence the
Mechlin-lace designs originally came) ; with
Ma.tsys’ Well (Quinten Matsys was a black-
smith who got fed up and became a famous
painter instead) ; and with Notre Dame
Cathedral, certainly the finest and purest
Gothic Church I saw in the Netherlands.
Very rich and warm, cruciform in shape,
with triple aisles and ambulatory. The place
was begun in 1352 by Applemans, of Bou-
logne, half-burned in 1533. smashed by those
iconoclast fools in 1566, and again in 1794
by French Republicans; and the building
wasn’t quite complete in 1908. Stone and
brick stand a lot in Belgium and take a long
time building; but they get built, and built
good. There are fine Rubens pictures'—-a
Resurrection, an Assumption, the Elevation
of the Cross and the famous Descent from
the Cross, all full of the bold imagination
and the incomparable modelling and color.
Van Diepenbiecb stained Hass and Verbrug-
gen carving make rich light and shade.
Rubens is all over Antwerp. Portrait
examples of his savage power and vigor hang-
in the Mus&e Plantin-Moretus, and in the
Beaux Arts, with devotional Van Eycks and
Memlincs, farms and kitchens, archers’
festivals, and long roads under skeleton
white trees of Van Dyck, Jordaens, the
blacksmith Matsys, Vrients and the Teniers
father and son.

BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few —the more
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some ,of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Wrinkles., and How to Remove them. —Worry,
late hours or the passing of old Father Time
may cause those ugly little lines which so
detract from the freshness and charm of a
woman’s face; but the cure is always the
same. Feed the tissues beneath the skin, and
massage them with a reliable skin food, which,
while nourishing the fatty tissues, will not
coarsen the skin nor grow hairs upon the
face, as so many inferior creams do. To
remove the wrinkles, bathe the face with hot
water, wipe it dry, then, while it is still
warm, smear a little mercolized wax over the
whole face, carrying it well down on the neck,
and, with the tips of the fingers, rub it gently
into the pores, working in an upward and
outward direction. Wipe off any superfluous
wax, leaving a little on the skin ail night.
In the morning wash off with warm water
and Pilenta soap. The use of the wax not
only feeds the skin, but removes the dead
outer cuticle, giving the fresh young skin
beneath an opportunity to breathe and show
itself.
Beautiful Hair—How to Shampoo.—Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky, depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once in
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing,
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stallax granules in a cup of hot water, fill a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse and dry by fanning with a palm fan, or
in the open ail-, if the weather permits. Should
the hair be naturally very greasy, the oil
massage should be omitted. Stallax can be
bought at any chemist’s in quarter-pound
sealed packages; it keeps indefinitely, and one
package contains sufficient for 25 or 30
shampoos.
A Greasy Skin and Blackheads.—Blackheads
are absolutely fatal to beauty, for they give a
coarse, dirty look to the face which no cos-
metics can ever hide. The way to remove
blackheads quickly and effectively has only
recently been discovered. For many years those-
who suffered in this way were restricted in
their diet, denied sweets and had to suffer
other privations. Modern science has, how-
ever, provided a simple, effective and quick
remedy. Dissolve one stymol tablet in a
glass of hot water, and when the effervescence
has subsided, dip a small, soft sponge into the
liquid and bathe the face. Leave for a few
minutes, then dry with a towel, and the black-
heads will come off. For a greasy skin bathe-
the face three times a week with stymol and
spray with cold water every morning, using a
vulcanite throat spray.
To Improve the Eyebrows and Eyelashes.—
Long, curling eyelashes make the most in-
different eyes look attractive, and while no-
one can alter the color, shape or size of the
eyes, all may possess luxuriant eyelashes and
well-shaped eyebrows. To increase the growth
of the eyelashes rub a little mennaline info-
the roots very gently every night. Mennaline-
is a perfectly harmless and delicate pomade-
like substance which may be obtained at any
chemist’s. For the eyebrows smear a little of
the mennaline on a small soft brush, and
brush into the eyebrows in a straight or
arched direction, according to how you wish
them to grow. A month’s treatment should
see a marked improvement.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
CAIRO.—No, I am not surprised at hearing:
from a reader so far away, as I get letters
from every part of the world. I expect it is
the heat that has caused you to put on weight
so rapidly, and can quite understand how
much it adds to your age. Get a small quan-
tity of clynol berries and eat one after each
meal. They will permanently reduce your
weight, are quite harmless, and you need
make no alteration in your diet.
QUEEN BESS.—Thirty is far too young to
have grey hairs, and you must not allow the
trouble to increase. Get two ounces of tamma-
lite, mix it with three ounces of bay rum, and
apply to the hair Avith a small, soft sponge.
This Avill restore the grey and fading hair to
its original color.
EMMELINE.—For your muddy-iooking skin
get a tin of mercolised Avax and rub a little
well into the face and neck every night. Leave
on till morning, then wash off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water. This will remove the-
dead outer skin and leave the complexion soft,
fresh and smooth.
JESSIE.—To remove the hairs from the lip-
and chin get an ounce of powdered pheminol
and use as directed. Then apply tekko paste
several times daily for some weeks. This com-
bined treatment will permanently remove all
trace of hair from your face,
FRECKLED LASS.—To prevent the freckles-
from appearing use a cleminite lotion. Get an
ounce of cleminite and mix it with four ounces
of warm water, allow to cool, then dab over
the face. This will not only protect the skin
from sunburn and freckles, but will give it a
dainty fresh look far superior to the bloom
imparted by the finest powder. [g

for EVERYTHING.
N these clays, when everyone is feeling the pinch
of war-time conditions and extreme scarcity
of many lines, our immense resources and the
big stocks at the New Palace Emporium go a long
way to lessen the burden of war-time costs.
After present stocks are exhausted and new
supplies come to hand—bought in many cases at an
increase on to-day’s retail prices in Sydney—there must
be still higher prices.
The wisdom of buying now will be apparent, to
all —purchasing future requirements to-day from stocks
that do not carry the full burden of war-time costs is
an investment that will prove a profitable one.
Our reputation for fair trading stands behind
this statement.

Sleep and Work.
Leaves slumbered, the winds slept,
Dewdrops gleamed and the stars crept;
And, as each shone
Over gulf and steep,
Night moving on
O’er field and town,
The world lay down —
Sighed, settled and went to sleep.
Leaves rustled, a wind blew,
Cattle lowed and a cock crew;
And as slow, slow,
Through the mist and mirk,
With gleam and glow,
Grey dawning broke,
The world awoke —
Yawned, shivered and went to work.

A Book.
There is a far-off magic way
That winds, bee-murmurous and gay,
Through long-sought words and bitter tears,
Through work and hope and endless fears.
There memories of Sharon’s Rose
(And one white dream that never goes)
Will haunt the shadows all day long
Till Night brings down her sleepy song.
Above the grey fast-fading light
The one white dream shines always bright,
That one good day my book may speak
In answer to the ghosts who seek
Idly some little half-heard thing,
Or some lost word that seems to sing
In tune with far-off thoughts long dead
As fallen tears in laughter fled.
No shining wisdom can be there;
No golden words that, brave and fair,
Go st-riding down the sunset road
To tall Apollo’s lost abode;
No iridescent radiant thought
In nets of moon and star beam caught;
No resonant deep-ringing bell
Found far away in Truth’s dark well;
But little words for ghosts to read
With fleeting smiles as, bead by bead,
They let my dream-strung rosary fall
Through kindly fingers—that is all.

Sunset.
Upon the trailing hem of afternoon,
As buttercups and daisy flowers that creep
Within-the gilded folds to sip the sleep
Which hides so closely from the early moon.
There are birds’ words and bees go by; for
soon
Will Night walk in and sky-white candles
peep
Through lattices; a-down the aery steep
The sun goes drifting like a toy balloon.
It is dull red; and all the West is red
Like yonder roofs; but from this fragrant
field,
Fancy fares out to where the batteries sit
Like wrinkled gardeners with their fingers
spread
Beneath the ruddy sun to point their yield
Of new-born wonder-flowers; redder than it.

FAIRY GOLD.
“We cannot help looking’ forward to a State revenue
of over £24,000,000 in the current year 'with many
misgivings.” —Sydney Telegraph.
At the present rate of progress it is esti-
mated that the N. S. Wales State revenue
this year may reach £24,000,000. It is, of
course, a boom year in the eastern States,
which are close up to the source of Federal
loan expenditure, for the Federal Govern-
ment is now borrowing at the rate of
£80,000,000 a year in the name of the war,
and putting £80,000,000 of paper “wealth”
into circulation in the form of war securities.
And most of the £80,000,000 paid to the
Federal Government in exchange for these
paper _ securities being itself paper which
only circulates in Australia, it has naturally
to be spent in this country, where it helps
the boom along. Then there are State bor-
rowings, and the N. S._ Wales State Govern-
ment, though the war isn’t its affair, shoved
on extra “war taxation” of its own. Still,
whatever the source of the great revenue may
be, it is there. And the amazing fact is that
the Holman Government professes to be just
as unable to execute public works without
loans as it was when the Labor party —
mostly Holman— closed its first financial
year in 1911 with a revenue of £14,000,000.
An increase of £10,000,000 per annum to
spend inside eight years, With very little
extra population to spend it on, makes no
difference to Holman. A further increase
to £34,000.000 a year in another eight years
won’t make any difference either, if the
present infamous gang of political profligates
and parasites remains in office, or is re-
placed by the gang that the Oppo-
sition could supply—it won’t make any dif-
ference, unless something is done to mend
their ways. It is all fairy gold, which dis-
appears at a touch. It comes and goes, and
every time it goes it leaves a bigger debt
behind. At the present moment N. S.
Wales is littered over with unfinished rail-
Avays, which yield little revenue because,
for want of loans, they have stopped in the
middle of nowhere, and which will yield
very little until they are completed. Yet
the interest on the loans which they repre-
sent eats up money like the large family of
the horse-leech. The scraps which are one
day to be the North Coast line had to be
subsidised by the taxpayer with nearly
£10.0,000 last year, and they are only samples
amid 2SOO miles of unpayable line. Yet
though the Government has hopes of
£10,000.000 more spending money this year
than sufficed in 1911 it doesn't see any
hope of finding a bit of revenue to finish
these jobs with. It is Avaiting for more
loans. Even in these bad times it expects
to have four times as much loan—very ex-
pensive loan—-to spend as sufficed 10 years
ago, but the imbecile crowd of theorists and
elocutionists is paralysed for want of more
loans.
* * * #
Every paper of any importance in Aus-
tralia protests at intervals against the loan
riot. Only one that The Bulletin knows
of—itself—advocates as the simple remedy
that loans for public works should be abso-
lutely prohibited by law, and that a
fixed amount for public works and
sinking-fund should be an automatic
charge on the revenue. In the case
of N. S. Wales, £2,000.000 or £2,500,000
or £3,000,000 a year might be suggested for
the Public Works Fund, but the amount is
less important than the principle. The
charge should be as automatic as that for
interest on the public debt, and a great deal
more so than the Governor’s salary. The
Ma State Ministry' is supposed to pay a
trifle of revenue every year into the Public
Works Fund, and sometimes it does. It is
supposed to pay an infinitesimal trifle into
a Public Debts Sinking Fund, and it does
or it doesn’t. For some years it hasn’t.
Why the most important section of public
finance should be left to chance, as if it were a
residuary legatee in a bankrupt estate, or
the holder of a tenth mortgage on a weak
security, or a deferred shareholder with pre-
ference shareholders and first, second and
third debenture-holders ahead of him, passes
understanding. The Public Works loan
policy calls for more criticism than anything
else, but the sort of criticism which is only
criticism counts for nothing. The Public
Works industry, as at present conducted, is
the only one which offers an incapable and
unprincipled Government boundless chances
for buying popularity—the popularity which
is its own personal and corrupt advantage—
by lavish spending without buying an equal
amount of unpopularity by lavish taxation.
. ls the finest device for purchasing votes
with Posterity’s money that was ever in-
vented. It puts a premium on bad Govern-
ment and gives the biggest, chance to the
most plausible focjl or worst scoundi’el—as
per many samples now on view. It is a
worse form of bribery than the plain old buy-
ing of votes with money, for the old, plain
con uptionist had at least the grace to find
the money himself. The disease has got to a
point at whiqh every loan needs a bigger loan
tiaMoAa HPJ and ever y £5,000,Q00 or
LIU,uOU,OOO of permanent and reproductive”
loan works requires increased taxation to
support the works because they were built
as much to buy votes as to yield revenue ;
and every £1,000.000 of extra revenue which
comes along finds the Government less able
than before to do things out of revenue.
Therefore the time is ripe, to invert a fine
old Tory phrase, to put the habit on the pro-
hibited list like any other leprosy.
* * * *
It isn’t sufficient to view the situation
with “misgivings,” as the Telegraph puts
it. If adulteration or the leaving of children
to grow up without a knowledge of reading
and writing, or the habit of infant labor in
factories, or crimes of violence, or anarchy,
or the tendency to embezzle the Sydney Tele-
graph’s funds had only been viewed with
misgivings, very little would have been
accomplished. In the present state of disease
the candidate, if such a one could be imag-
ined, who told a hungry electorate that he
didn t believe, in it getting its railway except
out .of taxation would have a poor chance
against the one who believed in reducing
taxes and giving the electorate two railways
the expense of people yet unborn, especi-
ally if the latter looked like a man who was
capable of. getting three railways. The
honest applicant for votes would be in the
exact position of the man of a century ago
in England who offered nothing per voter
against the one who offered £lO. In like
manner there was a time when no British
Prime Minister could hold office unless he
found salaried billets for most of the mem-
bers or their relations. He simply paid his
majority so long as it stuck to him. These
forms of bribery were suppressed, not by a
loose and disorganised pressure of public
opinion, but by business-like Act of Parlia-
ment. When the matter was put to them in
the shape of a Bill even the most corrupt
hesitated to vote against it and openly
declare themselves corrupt. Also, a lot of
very corrupt members were glad to be re-
lieved of the fear that they might be ousted
by people richer or even less scrupulous than
themselves. The struggle to be the worst
person m the race had become wearisome.
Ihe same sort of reform might be effected in
the case of the loan curse which has assumed
such enormous dimensions of late years.
Honest finance would have some kind of a
chance and a permanent basis if the
Treasurer could tell the deputation^—in fact
had to tell the deputation—which wanted a
slice of loan money that it couldn’t .have it,
tor there was none, and that there could be
none, because any debentures he issued
would be.in the category of bogus notes or
counterfeit coin. He would be in the same
position as if the deputation wanted to im-
port a cargo of cheap Chinese labor—that is
to say, he would have an impregnable sup-
port behind him, and couldn’t be coaxed,
bluffed or terrorised by fear of losing politi-
cal support. But if he had nothing behind
him. but unorganised public opinion (a spas-
modic thing which is asleep half the time),
his own conscience (which varies with every
change of Ministry) and the “misgivings” of
a half-hearted daily press, the influential
deputation would get its loan money or its
cheap Chinese labor nine times out of ten.
It is curious to reflect that even Holman
could be made an anti-borrowing Premier by
law, so that with the petty, sordid loan
swindle off his mind he would have a chance
to develop his capacity for great far-sighted
deeds of statesmanship. Law can do marvel-
lous things.
“THE BREAKFAST-TABLE OF THE
WORKING-MAN.”
It is important to every Australian, rich and
poor, that Germany shall refund to us the money
we have been obliged to spend on the war.
The crushing taxation due to the war will have a
tendency to inhibit marriage... .and will hamper
the development of our industrial, pastoral and
agricultural activities.
The dependants of the fallen and the incapacitated
soldiers and sailors will receive better measure of
care and attention than will be possible if no
indemnity is paid....
The breakfast-table of the working-man will be
an expensive one if Germany be allowed to go with-
out making full payment for the war.
—Pronouncement by the Returned Sailors and
Soldiers’ League.
It is a pity that men who have been so mag-
nificent and optimistic in the worst times of
the worst war should show a helpless sort of
despondency over simple ordinary affairs of
peace. It is anomalous, but the anomaly is
characteristic of Australia. The soul of the
country has been dry-rotted by the policy of
kw-tariffism, dependence on imported goods,
dependence on imported loans to pay for the
goods, and dependence on the alleged bound-
less natural resources—which are large com-
pared with the microscopic population, but
small for the size of the country—to pull it
through automatically. Out of these things
has come the double-barrelled idea that the
Australian is a poor creature who can’t
make his own wife’s clothing material, or
his cruet-stand or the hobnails for his own
boots, and at the same time that he is a
god-like and chosen creature who can’t be
expected to work as long or as hard as others
or to take the same pains to learn difficult
high-class industries.
* * * *
The position is that an indemnity should
be collected from the Hun. and collected to the
uttermost farthing. This paper has no sym-
pathy for the gang of Perth Labor Confer-
ence traitors who said the Hun should get
back all his possessions and his white and
colored slaves, and should be called upon to
pay for nothing beyond damage to property,
wlule it even refused to be explicit about
that. But it is just possible that if Hun-
land and all its contents were sold by auc-
tion they wouldn’t cover the full amount he
ought to. pay. So it is well to get it fixed
in our minds that this isn’t a poor worm-like
place (with “boundless natural resources” of
course) which can’t afford to marry and
can’t hope for a decent working-man’s break-
fast unless the Hun liquidates in full. This
is an upstanding continent —at least it would
be upstanding if it didn’t stand down so
much—and the only continent with one lan-
guage, one Government, practically one race,
almost unlimited elbow-room, a sea defence
all round it, and no prospective enemy with-
in thousands of miles unless the Perth Con-
ference idea of giving back German Papua
and Samoa to the Hun comes to pass. It bids
fair to emerge from the present trouble with
a . total debt, State and Federal, of
f 1 10,000,000 or £715,000,000 —rather over
£144 per inhabitant. The British debt will
run to about £157 per inhabitant. Therefore
this country is in a good position compared
with Britain, and a still better one compared
with some of the Allies. But the Australian
war debt—the wholly unproductive item —is
only about £7O per head, while Britain’s £157
is almost wholly an unproductive w T ar liabil-
ity. This country has done comparatively
in a monetary sense. And
if it likes to pay the interest on its debt out
ot taxation, as Britain—a country which
never says that it has “magnificent natural
resources”—does with its bigger debt, it will
have all the revenue from some £300,000,000
worth of productive works to build its new
w'orks with, and loans will be superfluous. No
other of the Allies has this advantage. The
position is magnificent as positions go nowa-
days. And if this country hasn’t the courage
to face even a magnificent position the mat-
ter is to be regretted, for our share of the
Hun indemnity may not begin to come along
for a good many years.
* * * *
It is only necessary to rapidly double the
population, partly by the birth-rate and
partly by attracting good British or Ameri-
can immigrants with the offer of lots of jobs
in lots of new industries, arid the debt will
be only £72 per head. Neither England nor
£ ranee nor Belgium (least of all Belgium)
could do that without bursting the crowded
land, yet Australia could do it and have less
than four persons to the square mile. It is
only necessary to multiply the population by
four m the same fashion—a thing that no
European country dare do and which the
United States couldn’t afford to do in a reck-
and the debt would be down to
£36 per head. If the population was increased
eightfold the liability would be a mere £lB
per head; yet even then Australia would
have just about 13 persons to the square
mne, far less than the density of Russia
INorway or Sweden, the coldest and most bar-
ren sections of Europe, and one-tenth that of
depopulated Ireland. There is no other
land in the world which can reduce its lia-
bilities almost out of sight in this off-hand
fashion, for no other has so much spare
room. It would only require 35.000,000 more
people to work the miracle. Britain alone
has been accustomed to export about 300.000
emigrants of its own race per year. It would
export far more if inducement offered, and
population, like money, accumulates at com-
pound interest. With these extra inhabi-
tants, or even half of them, the rev-
enue from public works, now starving
for lack of customers, would increase
amazingly. The immigrants would bring
money with them to add to the coun-
try s stock of loose change. As for the em-
ployment which these people would require
the Commonwealth. Math its beggarly nonula-
tion of less than 5.000,000, is sendimr as
much as £77,000,000 worth of employment
out of the country every year. In "other
words, under its low-tariff system, it is im-
porting goods to that value every year
instead of making most of them here, so
that the artisans would be carrying our debt
instead of somebody else’s debt. Assuming
the average earnings of industry to stand for
±ho per head (man, woman and child) per
annum, which is above the real figure, the
goods this country imports represent the
S U i Ct 4nnnnn P ° Pula 1 tion of people.
And 1.400.000 people manufacturing for us
here instead of abroad would be worth some-
thing like £200.000,000 capital, inasmuch as
they would take the burden of that amount
of our liabilities, whereas they now carry that
amount, or more or rather less, of the other
fellow’s liabilities. And these people, our
own employees, would pay us about
£8,400,000 a year in taxes instead of paying
it to somebody else. It is of course impos-
sible to divert all this business here, but if
.even 1,000,000 out of 1,400,000 workers
toiled for us on the spot instead of in a re-
mote spot, they would automatically lift
£140,000,000 of debt and pay £6,000,000 in
taxes; to say nothing of their contributions
to local rates and to railway revenues, and
the millions and millions of taxable land-
values they would create, and the number
of taxpayers and debt-carriers they would
themselves employ. For though the manual
Worker doesn’t pay much, the usual propor-
tion of these new people would develop into
employers, capitalists, etc. This is a better
outlook than waiting to collect the elusive
tail-end of an elusive Hun indemnity, which
is merely a case of waiting for dead Hun’s
shoes.
* * * *
There is nothing wrong with the working-
man’s breakfast-table except that almost
everything on it is imported save the bread
and the meat. And the working-man would
have little to complain -of if he could only get
out of the habit of giving most of the skilled
and high-priced work to people abroad. If
he is a humble sort of working-man he pays
no income-tax, for the exemption rate is much
higher than in England; no land-tax, no
municipal rates—directly at least; hardly
any customs and excise duties unless he
drinks ; and nothing for the education of his
children. The old-age pension, invalid pen-
sion and baby bonus are liable to come to
him. but they aren’t levied on him. Rut for
the inveterate habit of giving the best paid
work to outsiders, who charge him exorbi-
tant war prices and, exorbitant freights and
an exorbitant commission for the importing
middleman, and possibly make his own job
precarious to boot, and also “take a lunar"
at his price-fixing laws because they are
practically jj outside his jurisdiction, the posi-
tion would be quite good.
IF OUR SOLDIERS GO
BOLSHEVIKING.
Our soldiers—2oo,ooo or 300,000 of them—
will be coming back to work, and Australia
has no work t.j offer them, or not enough to
be worth mentioning. Hitherto they have
been paid out of war loans, but even the
effrontery of the most profligate Govern-
ment won’t allow of the indefinite floating
of war loans when there is no war. There-
fore the able-bodied troops will want work,
and their jobs haven’t been kept for them
save in scattered instances. Banks and
such-like institutions have been fair in the
matter ; Government departments have acted
more or less respectably; organised labor has
acted horribly; miscellaneous people have
acted anyhow. As for Parliament, it hasn’t
acted at all, except the wrong way. The
reasonable course, when a few hundred
thousand men are temporarily removed from
the working ranks, is for those who remain
to work longer and harder during the time
or stress, so as to keep industry alive,
lhen, when the trouble was over, they could
spread themselves out according to the old
conditions and make room. Instead, the
policy of organised labor has been rather to
reduce working hours and to go a little
s ower, and to set up a new doctrine that
anybody who offers to supply employment at
trades-union wages and under trades-union
conditions is an enemy and accursed. All
the same, organised labor, while putting it
on the One Big Union programme that “We
must and will own the workshops,” didn’t
start a single co-operative industry of its
own, in order to show the world ‘that its
eaders knew how to run workshops on
profitable, not Bolshevik, lines, and in order
to begin its policy of eliminating the private
employer. The long-eared Government put an
enormous penalty on the establishment of
ew industries by confiscating the earnings
with its War Profits Tax. No munition-
making industries and no shipbuilding in-
dustries worth mentioning arose to keep the
community from rusting.
* * *
So the industrial vacancy created by the
departure of our soldiers is hardly more per-
ceptible than the hole in the ocean where the
ship went down. The art of not doing
work has been brought to such an advanced
stage that the men who thought they left
jobs to which they could return will have,
in a vast number of cases, to fight other men
tor jobs, or else go jobless. There is much
talk of putting them on the land,” but
going on the land, except in the sense of an
aborigiMl hunting for ’possums in No Man’s
\Y lfderness, is a capitalist’s work unless the
goer is to begin entirely on borrowed money,
the lending of which is also the work of a
capitalist, State or private. And the capi-
tal must be advanced on terms which are
largely charity, and with practically no
margin of security, else all save a fraction
ot the men will go under in their attempts
to tackle off-hand one of the most highly-
skilled of all industries, especially seeing that
it is an overcrowded industry largely de-
pendent on distant markets, and not well
suited to a great part of this exceptionally
dry continent. The idea of putting soldiers
on the dust is a miserably insufficient device,
lo treble the agricultural population in one
great act is impossible, and another Public
Debt would hardly finance the operation,
(►senator Millen, who has been in the land
business, estimates the cost at £lOOO per
settler, or about £300,000,000 for the lot.)
In manufactures there is certainly room for
the whole returned army twice over, with a
steady market right at the door. It is a
diversified business, requiring only a fraction
of the capital which the land-settlement
device calls for. It is almost independent
of droughts, and there isn’t so long to wait
for the harvest. Also, it offers chances for
unskilled labor and for a hundred or a
thousand varieties of skilled labor; and
it offers all manner of chances for
fhe unskilled worker to develop into the
finished artist and to become a private em-


plover or a co-operative employer. Au ®
tralia imports about £77,000.000 worthy
goods—mostly manufactured goods pei
annum. So the opening is large enough.
And these are merely the goods we buy; tne
manufactured goods in the shape ot snips
that we hire to carry the trade represent a
gigantic industry in themselves. #
Unfortunately it seems to be agreed by a
multitude of unanimous fools that this
branch of employment must not be attempteo
bv the only means' which, if the record ot
Germany, Japan, the United States, C anada,
etc., goes for anything, can create industries
in a country which has to compete against
old and experienced competitors—especially
if it is a high-wage country as well as an in-
experienced one. The miserably inefficient
tariff is apparently regarded as an Ark of
the Covenant, or dogma of infallibility, _or
holy wooden god, or symbol of the divine
right of importers. Therefore it is hard to
see what there is for our returned soldiers to
do except go Bolsheviking and start a Com-
mune on the Parisian style of 1871, and take
Direct Action. That is to say, a few of them
may get work, and the men who are dis-
placed to make room may join the rest in
Bolsheviking. It may be a sinful thing to
Bolshevik, but that is not the question at
issue. The point is that sinful things are
done under sufficient provocation, or some-
times without it. Our soldiers will come
back to find that their employment lias
mostly disappeared—often their old employ-
ers have disappeared also. They will find
that in their absence the shirkers have added
nearly £100,000,000 to the country’s debts,
quite apart from war debts, and have had a
riotous time on the proceeds, inventing new
Government billets galore and building frag-
mentary railways like the N. S. Wales North
Coast line on day-labor and imported material
principles at nearly 2£ times which was
regarded as the legitimate cost in pre-war
days. They will find that they are just in
time to carry their share of the bill that was
incurred to avoid the establishment of in-
dustries that might furnish them with an
occupation. They will discover that the
State taxes—not war taxes, but the ones
required to pay interest on wasted loans and
the cost of Government jobbery—have almost
doubled while they were away, which is not
a pleasant reception; and that while they
were risking their lives in the country’s ser-
vice at 6s. per day, the gas-stokers of Cairns,
in the most distinctively pro-llun State of the
Commonwealth, had left off work on the
ground that £6 a week was an insufficient
wage. In every way they will find that they
are more or less intruders —that the com-
munity in general didn’t do their share of the
work while they were away in order to keep
their places open, so that the ranks of industry
have closed up, and left no space for them.
Even if they were all willing to be marooned
on dry lands, the country’s battered credit
and i*s deficits and its note-issue are in-
sufficient to meet the case of one-twentieth
of them. So unless the Government acquires
some semblance of sense and energy and
honesty a tendency to go Bolsheviking may
develop, just as it did in Russia when the
enemy started for home, and as it is doing in
Bulgaria and Austria and Germany. And if
such a calamity happens the premises of
many importers and Freetraders may be dam-
aged in the unreasoning scuffle. There has
certainly never been any time of real Bol-
sheviking in Australia. On the other hand,
there has never been a time when so many
men came home so suddenly to find so much
debt awaiting them, and so many parasites.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Too-Polite Party in the United
States, and the Other Party.
The Republican success, or partial success,
iu the U.S. Congressional elections is a pro-
test against President Wilson’s peace pro-
positions, or rather against some of them.
Ic isn’t a complaint about his war policy,
but about his lack of sufficient war policy.
The President, in addition to being a habi-
tual philanthropist, is a sort of theoretical
Freetrader. No one cared a copper coin
about that until the other day, for he might
have been ten Freetraders instead of one
without being able to shift the popular senti-
ment one inch. Like our own Hughes he is
a bookish man, who never had to struggle
with politico-economic problems for a living,
but merely struggled on printed pages, and
it seemed part of the order of things that he
should be a species of armchair Freetrader.
But when he put forth a hazy remark about
“economic freedom” among his bases of nego-
tiation it suggested a di’eam of establishing
some kind of Freetrade by treaty and clamp-
ing it down by international arrangement.
Again his approval of the wholly vague and
wholly Hun theory about “freedom of the
sea” aroused inquiry all round. The phrase
may mean anything or almost everything or
nothing. It may mean no more than the
empty form by which a distinguished visitor
may be given the freedom of London, or
Edinburgh, or Bendigo, or Granville, or it
may mean a new departure of the biggest
sort. The Hun version of it is, so far as
can be learned, that w’here narrow waters
lie between two States they shouldn’t be
fortified or defended or mined ; in fact, that
in war as well as peace they should be every-
body’s road. The reason is obvious enough.
Germany holds no narrow waters, while
other countries hold many. Under the Hun
interpretation Denmark, Sweden and, in a
less degree, Norway would not take advan-
tage of the position as keepers in war-time of
the gateway which connects the North Sea
and the Baltic —the only strong position
these feeble Governments have. It would
be as open to Germany as the Kiel Canal—
the other gateway which is w T holly German.
Then Britain and France would not defend
the Straits of Dover; nor Britain, Spain
and France the entrance to the Mediterra-
nean ; nor Britain the mouth of the Red
Sea. Whether the proposed rule would
apply where the strait, like Messina and the
Dardanelles and Torres Strait, had the same
Government each side of it doesn’t clearly
appear; but in a general way all nations
which had keys to natural waterways—not
artificial ones like the Kiel Canal—were to
give them up in the name of the world’s free-
dom. And Germany has no keys to give up
—only keys to receive. The United States
has little to lose and possibly something to
gain by the proposal, and it was evidently
hoped that Wilson, philanthropist and theo-
retical Freetrader, would “fall for it.”
M hether he has done so or not neither the
Allies —the United States is not an Ally, but
a powerful yet non-committed friend—nor
the Republican party, is quite sure. Also
Wilson is very indefinite about indemnities
and the confiscation of the Hun colonies.
Therefore the Republicans made a bid for
pcwer, not as any semblance of a peace
party, but as a party which regards the
President as too polite to an enemy on whom
politeness is a wasted emotion.
T? *
The Railway Man and His Holiday.
By arrangement, apparently, some questions
were put to N. S. Wales Minister for Rail-
ways Ball, in the Assembly the other day.
about concession tickets and free passes
granted to men employed on the State rail-
ways and tramways. It transpired from the
answers given that the passes annually issued
numbered 248,485; that if such passes were
paid for as tickets “the revenue would benefit
to the extent of £411,227” ; and that the
estimated value of the concession tickets to
the holders thereof was £59,336. Where-
upon a mournful wail was heard about “these
expensive privileges,” for which the taxpayer
has to find the cash, and someone alleged to
be a “Railway Employee” wrote to the Tele-
graph explaining that if these passes were
not available the people who get them would
“receive an equivalent addition to his ordi-
nary pay.” The allegation of the anonymous
“Railway Employee” is about as far off the
bull’s-eye as the arithmetic of the Minister.
It is possible that the revenue would benefit
to the extent of £411,227 if every man who
gets a holiday pass entitling him to travel
4400 miles in a first-class carriage, or 5250
miles in a second-class contrivance paid in
coin for tickets. But it is as morally certain
that not .001 per cent, of railway workers
would elect to expend from £lB to £26 a year
for the privilege of being hauled about the
landscape behind a locomotive. Further, it
is certain that though the holiday-making
railway man has the option of spending his
leisure on these multitudinous miles, the
number of them who travel continuously all
the time is so limited as to be negligible. The
£411.227 which it is assumed would be col-
lected if all the railway men were profligate
lunatics is a mere figment of a statistician’s
imagination. The yarn about the pass re-
cipient getting an equivalent addition to his
pay if the regulation about passes was not
in force, is no better. If there is any reason
to suspect that the passes stand in the way
of an increase of from £lB to £26 a year all
round, the sooner the railway employees get
a change in the system the better off they
will be. How many of them, no matter
what they were earning, would spend £26
every year on a holiday-ticket alone, and go
careering over thousands of miles of rail?
The Bulletin does not know whether there
is any abuse of the holiday-pass arrangement.
Probably there is. But it is mighty easy
to exaggerate the significance of the pass
to the revenue, to blither about fictitious
losses and to avoid seeing that in the special
circumstances the holiday pass is an inescap-
able circumstance. The State railways
extend from the Queensland border to the
Murray ; from Sydney to Bourke. Men are
subject to continual shifts —thousands of
them work in districts from which their
occasional escape is just as necessary to the
Department as themselves. The train the
ticket-of-leave railway man travels by has
to run anyhow. The fact of him being aboard
is neither here nor there, in a financial
way of speaking. A politician who imag-
ines that he ought to be carried about
free when he goes on holiday, and that the
man who helps to actually run the railways
should pay for both, seems somewhat deficient
under the hat.
Labor and a Big Heave-oh.
Dear Bulletin, —According to the eloquent
Premier Holman, who unburdened himself
of some melodramatic passages at Queanbeyan
the other day, there are several things it
behoves every citizen to be aware of. These
are :—■
1. That the greatest industrial upheaval experienced
in Australia is impending.
2. That unless this bright young nation gets busy
on increasing production it will go under.
3. That after the war there is going to be no
dearth of Capital in the country.
Whether it would not have been a fair thing
for Holman to explain what he is doing to
prevent the upheaval, elucidate his pro-
gramme for securing increased production,
and intimate how much of the available
capital he contemplates borrowing, is proba-
bly a side issue, since it was Holman who
happened to be speaking. But, limiting the
matter to the points of prophecy, only a man
who is deaf and blind would take the risk
of contradicting. A big industrial struggle
is coming, though not to-morrow. Both sides
know it. And, of course, from Holman and
Co. Labor will be blamed for going mad.
Perhaps it is mad already. Ido not know,
though I suspect it of being merely very
angry. In the meantime, while the storm is
gathering, it may be just as well to point to
some of the things that Labor is likely to be
still more angry about if Holman and his
friends persist in shirking their job and some
of the other things incidental thereto. All
over the world the mass of men and women
are becoming converted to the doctrine,
nebulous though it may be, that production
should be for use and not for profit. Go
among them here in Australia —read their
literature —attend their meetings; every-
where you find this doctrine dominating
their thought. Labor in Australia, not very
long ago so keen on “reform” and on politi-
cal activities and on progress measured by
statistics, is moving in another direction —
towards the destruction of the Capitalist
State. Call this folly if you like. Denounce
it as madness if you choose. That settles
nothing. The thing that matters —that forms
the very crux of modern statesmanship the
world over—is: What are you going to do
about it? The offer of another shilling or
two a day, the promise of a job in a factory
or behind a plough, the establishment of the
cheap-meat emporium and the free pill in
case of sickness, all of these grafted on to
the social and industrial system the world
knows to-day will count for nothing. Even
harsh language about agitators cannot alter
this great fact—-that Labor is everywhere sick
and tired of Capitalism in all its forms, and
particularly of it in its philanthropic aspects.
The crowd who are out to upheave on general
principles—and make no mistake about their
number—is in Australia certain of something
more than mere moral support from the less
militant crowd. The average plodding citi-
zen is accumulating many grievances.
Mainly these turn on his revenue. Pie finds
it doesn’t keep up to the expenditure. Pie
wants some clothes and gets less- for his
money. He wants food and spends more to
get it. He may be a fool not to be
satisfied with £1 worth 12s. 6d. The point
is that he is getting ready to make a noise
about the matter —to upheave for either more
money or more goods, which are about the
same things. This brings “increased produc-
tion” along. What does Holman propose
shall be done with the increase? What is
the basis of distribution to be of this new
wealth? And where are the plans and
specifications for securing it? Obviously
there must be increased production—if the
Capitalist system is to survive, anyway.
Obviously, too, there must be a practical side
to it. A reduction of wages for a given out-
put is, of course, equivalent to an increase
of production. But increased production
without increased wages is another thing.
Under all the circumstances it seems
reasonable to conclude that Holman
will notice his upheaval in good time, and
that it will not be retarded five minutes by
the politician who produces nothing more
tangible for distribution than hot air about
production generally. The knowledge that
there is just as much Capital (in the strictly
economic sense) in the country after the war
as there was before will encourage rather
than deter the impulse to upheave among
those who look on Capital and black snakes
as near relatives. —Yours, etc. O. Yess.
Our Ambassador, Hughes.
The representation of Australia —likewise of
Maoriland, South Africa, Canada, India,
Newfoundland and Hongkong—at the Peace
Conference is naturally a matter of doubt.
The custom is for an empire or kingdom or
republic to be represented as a whole, and if
dependencies are to appear separately, it is
difficult to say where the business will end.
It might lead to the conference looking more
like an army corps than an ordinary meet-
ing. Certain bits of the British Empire have
a sort of claim, because they are partly self-
governing, but, on the other hand, they are
not wholly self-governing—certainly so far
as concerns matters of war and peace and
foreign diplomacy they are not self-governing
at all. And there are so many of them,
including some too big for exclusion, yet too
small for admission, that they are an un-
manageable question. Certainly there will
be no special representation of political fac-
tions like the Irish Home Killers, the South
African Nationalists, the Australian Labor
party or the French-Canadians; so there is
at least one element of certainty in the case.
If Australia has a representative the finger
of Destiny points straight at William
Mokris Hughes. He is Prime Minister,
which puts him head and shoulders above
any other applicant for the position. He is
on the spot, so he is certain to arrive in
time. He can represent this country with-
out any extra expense, which is something,
for there has already been too much expense.
Besides, if Australia sent another ambassa-
dor with his suite —another one in addition
to Hughes and Cook' with their suites, and
the obscure, oblivious, obliterated but high-
priced Andrew Fisher with his staff, and
the six State Agents-General with their
appurtenances, London would be over-
crowded, and there would be an undue strain
on the food supply. Then Hughes is persona
grata with a large section of the British
people, or at least a large section has success-
fully disguised its animosity. Certainly he
has shown himself by all his utterances (and
he utters wonderfully) solid on the points
that the Hun must not get back his colonies,
especially those in the Pacific; that he must
pay heavily for the damage and the sin ; that
he must release the peoples whom he has
oppressed; that he must not be trusted in
any way; that it doesn’t matter twopence
if he is “humiliated” ; and that he is not to
be regarded as a brother, because he has
shown himself —Kaiser and Socialist, junker
and worker —to be less than a human being.
Furthermore, if Hughes wasn’t in England
he might be _ back here doing a lot of
harm. The idea of the Prime Minister
advocating large, sound Australian princi-
ples in England is beautiful. The idea of
him muddling details of administration in
Melbourne is not.

“Chris” : Next to Apple Island, South
Aus. is the State which has gone in big for
horticulture. That it isn’t every community
which could afford to take up the scientific
cultivation of cabbages and grapes, as South
Australia has done, is amply shown by the
reports which the Royal Commission on
Water Supply in that State issues from time
to time. The seventh progress report is just
to hand. It shows that the average annual
loss on the waterworks controlled by the
hydraulic engineer, from 1910 to 1917, was
£69,771. Last year’s loss was £66,000. The
interest on the money borrowed to get the
business in working order averages about 3.75
per cent., and the return during the last 10
years has only been about 2.79 per cent.,
while last year there was a loss of about
1.12 per cent. No sinking fund has been
provided to pay off the debt, so that while
the works may go to wrack and ruin, the
debt remains until further notice. Altogether
the waterworks of the State have been re-
sponsible for an aggregate loss of £1,756,923,
and the country schemes take the biscuit as
good losers. The Commission proposes to
make slight increases in the water-rates, for
which it seems difficult on the face of it to
find legitimate reasons. In the metropolitan
district- the minimum rate is to be £l, instead
of 15s. as at present, but at the same time
the quantity of water is to be increased from
12,000 gallons to 16,000 gallons before ex-
cess is charged. In the country it is pro-
posed to level up the charges correspond-
ingly, graduating rates according to the vary-
ing degrees of civilisation obtaining in these
places, and the degree of prosperity achieved
by the horticulturists. The total improve-
ments in the financial malady should amount
to about £40,000 annually, thus leaving a
leeway of another £26,000 for the time being.
But this will be considerably enlarged upon,
Victory.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now let the glad bells clash in the reeling
steeple,
For the strife of the ages is done:
God, in the strength of a Man, has looked
on His people;
And a Man is more than his gun I
Let the bells ring!
Let the horns blow!
Let the winds fling
The flags to and fro!
Let them flap to the thufider
Of shouts in the street,
To the movement of feet,
To the eyes in their wonder
Where cheering throngs meet!
Tear the high skies asunder
With bugle and drum !
The cloud we lived under
Has broken in thunder,
And through the loud lightning
A splendor has come,
Flaming and brightening
Heaven’s arch in its span,
Till the sun in his glory
Shines white on the story
Of conquering Man.
They who wrought the perfect plan,
They who drew the bolts of fire,
Who, of pride, the strife began,
Mating murder with desire —
Lo, their flags are in the mire!
Lo, their hearts are in the dust!
And the children at their play
Mock the iron of their trust,
Where it makes a reddened rust
In the green and growing day.
Let the bells ring!
Let the horns blow!
■Where is the king
Of their brazen show?
Of the blood and steel,
Of the fire and lust,
Of the ii-on heel,
And the poisoned thrust?
Name him no more.
At a close-shut door
He trembles and fears.
He starts in the night
At the sound of tears;
At the breaking of light
Ever he hears,
In the marching van
Of the hosts of Man,
Here and hereafter.
A scorning laughter
That cannot be still.
He wrought us ill
Under sun and moon ;
But the truth we know.
Let the horns blow!
Let the drums leap
Through the triumph sweep
Of the cornet and deep bassoon !
For he who had planned the loud blood-revel
Rose on our gaze like a painted devil
And fell like a dull buffoon !
Hang him, if ye will,
High in a tree ;
Little blood to spill
Has your Germany.
Little shall we care
If he dance on air.
Be it rope or blade,
Ye, the things he made,
In his passing, share!
Let the bells clash loud in the rocking
steeple!
The day of our peace is come ;
And the Word of God is heard in the voice
of the people
The gleam of a sword made dumb!
There shall be seed to sow,
There shall be harvest to reap ;
And all the world shall know
Labor and good sleep.
Never a king shall wake,
With a sword red in his hand,
A tempest of blood to shake
The homes of a free land.
This by blood have we won,
A people’s place in the sun
And a faith that none can break.
Lift the new strain
To-the clean skies!
A little child shall reign
With fearless eyes.
The hail of steel is o’erblown
And the tempest of blood is stilled ;
Now shall the thing be known
That the Great King willed.
Out of the dark we come
To the beat of a child’s drum,
With eyes wide to see
The light of the world to be,
With hearts wide to know
The way the great winds blow !
Let the bells ring!
Let the horns blow!
We have seen the wonder
Of truth through the thunder
That laid the kings low.
Rises a mist and a call
In the far places.
Men marching stalwart and tall
With light on their faces,
Wave to us over the seas.
Lo, our dead are these;
But let no tear fall.
For they who died for us call
In a new, clear voice
Bidding the world rejoice.
Well was their blood-price paid.
That none should make us afraid.
Let the bells ring!
Let the horns blow!
There is a new song to sing,
A new thing to know!

alter effect has been given to its recommen-

Australians have to consider is whether they
can afford to continue to grow these expen-
sive public vegetables. But before they make
up their mind in a dismal mood, they should
or course consider the probable improvement
through future closer settlement and subse-
quent swelling of revenue.
“Dec Tag.”
At last the horrible struggle is over. Four
years and three months ago Germany started
out to conquer the world. On Thursday her
emissaries entered the Allies’ lines and asked
tor peace. On Monday the armistice was
signed. To-day the German armies are with-
drawing beyond the Rhine, the Kaiser is a
fugitive, and the German people are in re-
V 0 ii * s difficult to get an historical
parallel for the stupendous events of the last
tew weeks. Probably there is not one, nor
one even remotely resembling them. There
have been holocausts before. Defeats and
victories and bolting kings and revolutions
are the commonplaces of history ; but in this
war there has been seen the triumph of human
right, the victory of man as the individual,
a straight-out fight between the world’s
democracies and militarist autocracy for
ascendancy. The Allies have won, as they
always were bound to win if they
stuck to the job. In the military sense
the terms of the armistice imposed upon
Germany are very hard. They amount to
the complete capitulation of the militarist
outfit witli which the Fatherland was bur-
dened. It will be for the German to take
II P now the broken strands of life again and
set about weaving them into something with
a different pattern than was drawn for him
by Bismarck'. And in many respects the
contract before the German does not differ
very materially from that in which the rest
of the world is interested. The terms of
final peace will be decided by the Allies.
Reparation for the wrongs indicted on in-
vaded countries will of course be, as
f<ir as possible, enforced. But even
this will be but poor satisfaction com-
pared with knowledge that a criminal
and brutal system has been swept out of
existence—that the people of the world no
longer shiver at the thought of an inter-
national murderer’s sword. Over these and
other matters the Kaiser will be able to
ponder at a distance, and commune with
Gott over the cataclysm that shattered him
and all that he stood for.
Dropping the Pirate.
Germany has dropped the pirate—not the
pilot this time. The Kaiser and his eldest
son have resigned the Hun diadem to-
gether, and there is hardly even a pretence
made that the grandson has a divine right
to the succession. The abdication doesn’t
really matter, for the Kaiser and the Crown
Prince were going in any case. The avoid-
ance of the question of the grandson’s heredi-
tary claim doesn’t matter, for no one was
taking notice of it in any case. There is
one reason for supposing that the Germanic
Empire, which had its first capital in Paris
and reappeared after many vicissitudes at
icnna, and emerged again in 1871 after
more vicissitudes at Berlin, is finished at
last. That avenue at Berlin in which are
shown the images of all the emperors that
ever were or were ever supposed to be, is
fuff. If another Kaiser happens his image
will have to be put round the corner, and
the lIoiiENZOfiLERNS don’t turn corners
gracefully, nor do the Hapsburgs. It is
understood that a new •'Parliament, if one
can be elected without the ballot-box being
trodden under foot, will decide on the new
form of Government. The people, in their
ordered and regulated lives, have never done
such a thjng before, and will hardly know
how to set about it. The idea suggests a bear
learning the alphabet. Some are trying
to go Bolsheviking— to loot towns, to mutiny,
to sot things on fire, to kick their officers in
the tentative fashion of people who never
kicked an officer before, and to drive Autho-
rity's spiked helmet down over its ears by hit-
ting it with a board on the spike. They
have ali the< necessary ferocity and hope to
acquire more, and the looting habit, which
was always with them, has been strength-
ened by four years of war. But there is
something missing in the composition of a
race which has to borrow the Marseillaise
from the hated enemy to express its feelings.
It never, in all its life, expected to have any
feelings to express, except those prescribed
for it, and it hadn’t its song of revolt handy.
There ;s no other case on record where a
great State got from the top of the class to
the bottom in one act. Lucifer, who went
from Paradise to Sheol in a single stride, is
the nearest thing to a precedent. There is
no instance of so many banks shutting up at
once, or the interest stopping (presumably
it will stop), or so big a public debt, or of
so many subjects being mad at one ruler, or
of the man that so many people are mad
about having so few places to go to, or of so
many tons of paper money depreciating on
the same day, or of a naval power which was
almost the supreme naval power going to
pieces without one historical sea fight to its
credit. It probably never happened before
that so many nations were unanimous, the
Kaiser being the person they are unanimous
about. Brotherhood, thanks to him, has be-
come a drug in the market, so that the
Brazilian got into the same fighting-line
with the Japanese, and the Arab swapped
congratulations with the Australian on the
battlefield. This war of superlatives began
with a wealth of language which left Xerxes
and Napoleon, both confident men of high
vocabulary, hull down on the horizon. There
has probably never been an awakening like
the one that has come on the Ilun people
since Adam awoke for the first time, and re-
marked that there was no precedent for the
situation. The indemnity promises to be a
record ; and the construction of new States
another record. So the community which
was promised a world and only got a shock
and a bill naturally proceeds, in its uncouth,
untutored way, to break things. In such a
case there is always an irrelevant hope that
the skull of an oppressor will be taken as part
payment of the account. Also there is a
tendency among far-seeing folk to seize some-
body’s money and bury it somewhere in case
credit should become extinct. If society dis-
solves into chaos then a pauper with 2s. 6d.
may be richer than a millionaire with no
small change about him. Also there is a
chance of picking up somebody else’s wife in
the confusion, or killing an enemy, or losing a
poor relation —or a rich one. It is difficult
to guess at the future, for a revolt of
machines is practically unknown, and what a
maddened power-loom or a bitterly disap-
pointed locomotive might do no one knows.
But if it does nothing in particular after
all it will be a tame ending to a world’s
tragedy. The wrath of a disgusted people
ought to culminate in the Smash of Ages.

War Loans and Compulsion.
After handing the House of Reps, some
figures about the last War Borrow, Acting
Prime Minister Watt intimated that in
the opinion of the Government it would
be necessary to place the Compulsory Loan
Bill on the Statute Book. As the last loan
was over-subscribed, as the number of sub-
scribers represented one in 20 of the popula-
tion, as there is more money of a sort in
Australia to-day than was ever before, and
as the scheme of compulsion embodied in the
Bill dangled by Watt before the populace
was part of a very conspicuous muddle, the
reasons for the Ministerial convictions are
somewhat obscure. Possibly Watt will sup-
ply some illumination later. Meanwhile it
seems to The Bulletin that, even if the
necessity for compulsion be established, quite
a lot of argument will be needed before
Watt can convince anyone of the wisdom
of the plan he lately expounded. To put that
plan into operation would create all sorts of
trouble for the Legislature, impose gross
hardship upon many citizens, and still fur-
ther intensify the brpeaucratic system of
government into which Australia drifted
during the war. There are three main points
of criticism to which the Compulsion Bill
are open. One is that the onus of determin-
ing the levy upop him is left to the indivi-
dual citizen. The other is that he has no
means of knowing whether he has to sub-
scribe, since if the loan fills without his con-
tribution, he can stand out. And a third is
that in the event of compulsion being applied
the taxpayer has no appeal from Red Tape.
Generally speaking, such a plan as this is
pore like offering prizes for successful guess-
ing than anything else. And Watt’s scheme
so far from following the Maoriland method
as alleged, departs from it in very important
respects. Over yonder the individual gets
notice of the amount he is assessed for. and
he has appeal from the assessment to a
Supreme Court Judge. In all the circum-
stances, and in order to avoid confusion,
Watt should amend his Bill in a way that
will (1) make it clear whether compulsion
is actually operating, (2) ensure the tax-
payer being officially notified of what is ex-
pected of him, and (3) allow of officialdom
having its demands reviewed. Moreover, the
scale of one-sixth of three years average in-
come-tax operating on the stout and the lean
alike, is clearly as unjust as is the further
provision that no notice will be taken of
subscriptions to earlier loans. For neither
of these parts of the Bill-in-reserve is there
anything to be said. On many people in re-
ceipt of the smaller incomes compulsion
would press with extraordinary severity. As
the amount that would be raised from these
would, on a £40.000,000 loan, be relatively
trifling, a system of sliding compulsion,
beginning at the top and working downwards.
should not be impossible to devise. As,
according to Iynibbs, there are 211,511 per-
sons in Australia with incomes over £4 a
week (about one in 25), and Watt says
there were 241,000 subscribers to the last
loan (or one in 20 of the population), it
scarcely looks that the shirkers are very
numerous.
“Gallery" : The further debate on the Elec-
toral Bill in the Reps, showed compulsionists
and voluntarists in some curious lights.
Sampson moved an amendment t<? make
voting obligatory, whereat Gregory, who has
yielded to no man in his advocacy of Conscrip-
tion, proposed to delete compulsion entirely
from the Bill, even leaving the matter of
enrolment to the individual’s personal choice.
At this, voluntarist Tudor nearly swooned,
and Dr. Maloney, who would never use
force to a lagging recruit, passionately
declared his willingness to drag the backward
elector to the poll by the ear. lie didn’t say
that in so many words, but that was the
English decoded from his bristling whiskers
and vigorous arm-play. Byncii, member for
Werriwa (N.S.W.), who is a voluntarist
except in a few small things like paying
taxes, eating and sleeping and the Ten Com-
mandments, drew the most harrowing picture
in a long and inglorious debate. In language
seething with emotion he described the hyper-
bolical tragedy of his god, the cocky, battling
with a hypothetical bushfire on the very day
he was compulsed to the poll. In this event-
uality must Cocky see his family and even
his cow roasted alive sooner than fail in his
electoral duty? The query seemed to knock
the House endways.

“Yambacoona” : On August 17, 1917 the
Kogarah-Sandringham (N.S.W.) steam tram
crashed into a motor-car conveying four men
into Ivogarah along Railway-parade. The re-
sult was that two of the men in the car died
from their injuries. An action was taken by
the widow of one for £2OOO compensation
and the jury returned a verdict for £l5OO on
September 4, 1918. It was shown at the
hearing of the case that the N. S. Wales
Railway Commissioners had been time and
again requested to make some alteration in
the running of trams at this spot, but with
no success. Lamb, K.C.. counsel for the
Railway Commissioners, admitted all through
the case, and in his closing address, that the
spot was a dangerous one.’’ The Commis-
sioners’ witnesses said the same, the driver
° L the tram at the time going so far as to
say (from the witness-box) that at this
spot he could only blow the whistle and
trust to luck.” It was shown that the speed
of the ancient tram had to be excessive at the
spot to enable a grade of 1 in 20 to 1 in 40
to be negotiated, and the jury added riders to
their verdict to the effect that “they sympa-
thised with the driver of the tram.” He
was in no way to blame, the construction
of the line necessitating the high rate of
speed, etc., and the driver was in an in-
vidious position. “They [the jury] had
seen the spot and considered the signs of
warning at the corner not only insufficient
but to a large extent misleading. They
recommended to the Commissioners that a
man with a nag or some like precaution should
be placed at the spot to obviate future acci-
dents. That is over six weeks ago, and the
tram still does the same old rush in the
same old spot. The only precautions taken
so far have been the removal of a couple of
trees which obscured the view, but this was
done soon after the expensive accident 12
months ago. But, come to think of it, N.
8. Wales runs more than its railways on
the blow-the-whistle-and-trust-to-luck” sys-
tem.
Dr. Edward Robertson, chairman of the
/ 1C - D° ai ’cl of Public Health, announces
that Spanish influenza is to be regarded in
his State as an infectious disease. For
treatment, Robertson suggests the adoption
of the “inhalatorium” plan—not his own
idea, of course, nor even that of the Huns,
whom he mentions as its originators. The
system has been in use by the British defence
authorities for some time, and Australia
should have had it working long ago.
When this country’s military damps were
scourged with meningitis, surgeon Henry
O’Hara proposed that buildings of some
light material should be run up at once,
batches of soldiers to be soaked in them for
a few minutes with medicated steam. It
was an excellent plan, yet it was received
by the military and public health authori-
ties in dead silence. Now, after a long
wait, during which the scheme has been
widely adopted in various parts of the
world, Victoria is “experimenting” with the
plan for diphtheria cases. It ha s even been
suggested that an inhalatorium should be
attached to all large schools, while muni-
cipal councils may also be called on to pro-
vide the same facilities for the treatment of
the general public. If the Board of Health
keeps up its present rate of progress in the
matter, the job may be done by about the
end of 1919. by which time the victims of
the approaching imported epidemic wall be
all safely dead and buried.

It would be easy to so flavor “Bought and
Paid For" as to leave a mighty hasty taste
in the mouth. The probability is that the
writer thereof, (ieorge Brohdliurst, intended
it should be so flavored—that the cannibal
ancestry of Robert Stafford should be
definitely impressed upon his wife rather than
the realisation that she had a htisbhhd whose
amorousness became intensified with grape-
juice. The temptation to season it this Why
is great, even though the effect would be to
make most of the incidental dialogue
banal and the reconciliation an outrage,
Muriel Starr and Frank Harvey avoid the
temptation, and, as the play is now pre-
sented at the Criterion (Sydney), the nasti-
ness is slurred over, the comedy emphasised,
and to the writer’s way of thinking the whole
thing looks and sounds more rational. Staf-
ford, a rich man, has married a poor girl.
He is in the habit of occasionally arriving
home with a full cargo, and there is a hint
that on these occasions he becomes matrimoni-
ally something like a hyena. In the second
act he reaches his wife’s boudoir bite
at night, jovial and tight, and ready to
insist upon asserting his ownership: There
is a scene that might be made very harrow-
ing—the. spectacle, of a husband struggling
for physical mastery, smashing down the
door of his wife’s bedroom, and, inflamed
with booze, proclaiming his proprietary
rights. Yet all this is so done that the audi-
ence gets little more than the impression of
a woman’s distaste for alcoholic endearments
and the husband seems no worse than a
fuddled ass instead of looking like a bar-
barian. The rest of the scene is good,
human comedy and the remainder of the
play is mostly a laugh.
* * * *
Muriel Starr as Stafford’s wife has a part
that suits her well, and if at times her atti-
tude towards the man is rather incoherent
the fault is not hers. The actress, however,
seems to be falling into a conventional style
of talking, and adopting the machine-made
gesture with a little too much enthusiasm.
If she wishes to escape a certain degree of
dulness she should try and recover some of
the apparent spontaneity of utterance and
action which characterised her earlier work.
Perhaps she is getting tired of some of these
parts. If this is the case, there is not much
to be surmised at. As. the husband, Frank
Harvey makes more than good, principally
by exercising a wise restraint. His inter-
views with his absurd brother-in-law, James

“Bought and Paid For” will be till the end
of next week.
’Twas the actors’ “Dilemma” to know what to do
With a vast flood of words and to make them sound
true;
For the folk for such jobs must indeed be a spry
lot,
Despite of the fact that McMahon's their pilot.
But they managed it bravely, by sheer force of jaw,
Till the people declared what a wonder is Shaw.
Well, he is; but with Turner and Bryant as factors,
How much is George Bernard’s, how much is the
actors’ ?
The fine opening performance of Shaw’s
“Doctor’s Dilemma,” at the Palace (Syd-
ney), was bettered at the second showing.
The play went with more assurance and vim ;
and a well-filled house appreciated every
point. In the third act the voice of the
prompter was occasionally heard with a dis-
tinctness that suggested a lack of finish,
but it could hardly be said that any of the
parts were ragged. As before, Eardley
Turner and George Bryant put in the most

brilliant work ; but
Olive Wilton
showed a lot of im-
provement, and it
may fairly be
claimed that she
got as much as was
reasonably possible
out of her long and
trying part. Alfred
Bristowe was more
emphatic, without,
however, heighten-
ing the effect of his
character study;
while Kay Souper,
carrying a moun-
tainous weight of
words, appeared to
be more at his ease.
The application of a
cross-cut saw to
portions of the
“Doctor’s Dilem-
ma” might be
against the reper-
tory spirit; but the
fact that Gregan
McMahon gives the
whole thing in all
its wordiness, and
that it never drags,
says a lot for the J.
and N. Tait co. On
the other hand,
variety is the key-
note of the reper-
tory idea, and the
presentation of the same play at three succes-
sive matinees is too like the regular theatre’s
method. Actors who are working hard every
night are too much taxed in filling a long
part in a new play of literary quality for one
matinee every week; and it looks as if
McMahon, as in Melbourne, will have to
train some mummers of his own, in order to
get the freshness of eternal change whith the
enterprise demands. The “Phagocytes” are
to be stimulated for the third and last time
this (Thursday 1 afternoon. Next week John
Galsworthy’s “Pigeon” and Shaw’s “How He
Lied to Her Husband” are promised.
❖ ❖ »!«
As well as the booked patrons who travel
to Her Majesty’s (Sydney)'as the crow flies,
melodious “Katinka” is getting its share of
the victory crowds that keep wandering to
and. fro amid the flags and racket until they
feel impelled to find a sect at a good show
and have a rest from rejoicing.
Still wide open, “The Eyes of Youth,” at
the Palace (Sydney). Emelie Polini and co.,
are keeping the handy theatre full with the
attractive little play which drags the young
heroine up and down three roads of destiny
without so much as crumpling her blouse.
To-night (Thursday) Sydney .Tames simul-
taneously scores his 100th Pierrot Pie per-
formance at the Playhouse (Sydney), and
finishes “Pie No. 7.” On Friday he sets
out after the second century with “Pie No.
8,” which includes an elaborate burlesque
entitled “The Lies of Truth.”
“Honi Soit” goes on merrily enough at the
Tivoli (Sydney), and Barry Lupino is so
frequent that some night while going off he
will collide with himself hurrying on.
In “Revelation,” the screen adaptation of
Mabel Wagnall’s “Rosebush of a Thousand
Years,” romantic mysticism is threaded into
the love story of an American artist and a
Paris cabaret dancer. The unrealities of the
picture are made to appear real by the fine
acting of Madame Nazimova, a new star. She
will shine during the week at the Strand
(Sydney). The Lyceum has old friend
Madge Kennedy in the part of a shy, awk-
ward girl without a soldier sweetheart.
Determined to go one better ,than her teasing
Red Cross companions, she invents a hero
husband and then turns a coward into a
gallant soldier for whom she proudly and
rightfully can wear “The Service Star.” The
Crystal Palace makes a bid for custom with
Corelli’s “Sorrows of Satan,” wherein the
overworked Devil is irreproachably clothed
and manicured, and is the tempted rather
than the tempter. Gladys Cooper is the
naughty lady who tries to juggle poor old
Lucio out of his hour of Paradise, but her
husband saves the situation —for Satan—-at
Hoyt’s and the Haymarket.
“Going ' Up,” the new Yankee musieal
comedy, making its first Australian run at
the Royal (Adelaide), was a strong little
story before ever music was put to it. In
the yarn Street is a young author making
holiday at a summer hotel after writing a
best-seller, which included a purely imagi-
nary account of an air-fight. This has been
taken in dead earnest by the other guests,
and, before he quite knows where he is, he
has been backed for big money to fly a
match ; and when he finds that the hand of
a certain girl is likely to go to the winner
he makes the mad venture. It is the only
musical comedy on record in which a worked-
up audience has cheered a hero, as if he
were in melodrama, when he said “I will do
it!” It is also the only one in which a fas-
cinating hero has stood around for two acts
in a blue funk, uttering gloomy prophecies of
his own early death—much as though the
sentimental interest of “The Arcadians”
should centre in Peter Doody. Like that
play, too, is the scene where the flight is
followed round the dress-circle with race-
glasses by the whole company with an inten-
sity which fires the audience. The action of
the piece makes another spurt in the last 10
minutes, just when most of such shows go
to bits. Backers and rivals together, all
genuinely fond of Street, get news of his
wobbly flight by countless ’phone and tele-
graph messages from all over the country-
side till he totters in a winner. On the first
night, when the curtain fell on this scene,
the Mayor of Adelaide rose in his place and
led wild cheering for all parties concerned.
That is the sort of play it is.
There is much jolly music, of the un-
mistakable “High Jinks” brand, in “Going
Up.” Maud Fane gets most of the “fat.” and she
is singing charmingly. Frith, as the hero, has
the biggest chance Australia has so far given
him. Setting aside his usual extravagances,
he proves himself a sound light comedian. Of
next importance is Field Fisher, as the burly
mechanic who teaches him, with chairs and
tables, the rudiments of aviation. Cecil
Bradley sings well. William Greene has
little to do but look picturesque in flying
costume.

“What Happened to Jean” is a locally-
made film-play that has been crowding the
Town Hall (Adelaide). The alleged plot is
just awful, and might blow out even
Charles Garvice. Jean, winning a Ford in
a guessing-competition, calmly leaves it in
Victoria-square, takes the best car in sight,
and plies for hire on North Terrace. When
arrested she interviews the fashionable lady
owner, who, knowing nothing of her except
as a motor-thief, adopts her as a daughter!
(At curtain-fall she turns out to be the
lady’s daughter !) Fortunately, photographer
Ivrishock has had a free hand, with buildings
and gardens willingly lent for the production.
The actors were experienced amateurs, and
one or two pros. The best of the film is
scenery in the Hills, a Government House
garden-party with many prominent Adelaide
people, and finally a bathing scene in which
many girls capture the villainous Fitzherbert
(from the Tivoli) and duck him with such
realism that he must have been nearly
drowned.

From “Business Before Pleasure” to “The
High Cost of Loving,” at the Royal (Melb.),
the artistic decline is too steep to be de-
tailed in a paragraph. In place of the whole-
some absurdities of Potash and Perlmutter
we now get the nasty exuberance of four
decayed Jews trying to dodge the responsi-
bility of a paternity in which a gay female
has apparently involved them. It adds
nothing to the importance or the savor of
the joke that the lady’s alleged offspring
cannot know his own father, since on
the preliminary evidence his mamma indulged
in promiscuous polyandry to the full limit
of her fancy. Indeed, she seemed to
have enough Hebrews to distribute over the
whole week, naturally keeping each one in
blissful ignorance of the others, and ulti-
mately blackmailing the lot to the tune of
many dollars a month. When the piece
opens the frivollers’ joint and several indis-
cretion is 25 years old, and they have nothing
by which to remember their fun but 25
years’ receipts for maintenance and the awful
possibility of an illegitimate turning up.
However, when a young stranger eventually
appears and is unanimously mistaken for
the son, who is finally proved a myth, all
the moral susceptibilities that were previ-
ously shocked are soothed to a degree of
complacence that wins a pardon for the ugli-
ness and error of the indecorous business.
But The Bulletin is not disposed to be
uncensorious. To base three acts of poor
farce on the grotesque amours of four elderly
Cohens is a fairly intolerable misdemeanor;
but when the farce depends for its laughter
on crude scrimmages and jostling, inter-
spersed with the deranged impromptus of
Yiddish comedians, the offence is overweight.
The Bulletin suggests to J.C.W., Ltd.,
that the thing should be withdrawn. The act-
ing nearly all through is cheap and loud.
The most reposeful of the characters was
the bent and tottery Uncle Tiedemeyer,
played by Tal Ordell. Nick Adams, as the
leading sinner, Klinsky, was vociferous
enough when he merely opened his head,
but when he waved his arms he was a public
meeting. James R. Waters, cast as Nathan
Sternberg, was mere restless futility; and
Edmund Sherras, as the supposed son of
four different papas, was a painfully artless
character having for blood the concentrated
essence of abotft 17 curates. In the play he
makes an unaccountable marriage with Rose
Rosenblatt (Rosie Parkes), who seemed to
have all the mustard necessary for a much
warmer partner. Frank Hawthorne was
camouflaged in the garments of Aaron Rosen-
blatt, and he sounded as if he ought to be
grateful for being denied the use of his own
personality. Maggie Moore, Mattie Brown,
and George Edwards were inconspicuously
placed, the maid Becky, by Helen M. Adams,
appeared to be badly affected by the contagi-
ous idiocy of the play.

“Hello, Everybody,” at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.), continues the frankest foolish-
ness that any management can devise. But
the shrieks of laughter that are aroused by
absurdities of the low level of “The Build-
ers” (Scene 2) do not encourage the Firm
to produce anything more brainy or charm-
ing. All the same, there are one or two rare
moments in the revue that achieve their
effect without the help of the knockabout
squad. One of the happiest episodes is “The
Gathering of the Clans,” wherein the familiar
tartans of Scotland get all the advertisement
that young Australia can give them. The
scene lingers longer in the memory than any
of the disturbances in which the leading
jesters appear. In fact, the limbs of the
McPhairsons, Frasers and all the rest of
’em hold the mind’s eye to the welcome exclu-
sion of the principals on the stage.
Lacking the chorus and ballet strength of
its big relative at Her Majesty’s, “Every-
body’s Doing It,” at the Tivoli (Melb.), has
to depend a good deal on the personal factor.
The consequence is that the leads are called
upon for more service than can reasonably
be tolerated without causing boredom. We
get too much of Charles Workman, with his
stupendous repertoire of syncopated giggles.
Also the superfluity of Florence Fox and
Fayette Perry is made more tiresome by the
undeviating sameness of their contributions.

Allen Doone’s scope for the iloquence that
is seething within him will be enlarged by the

Wirths’ Circus can still be found near the
south side of Princes Bridge (Melb.). Any
hermit in need of enlightenment on the
development, progress and resources of the
acrobatic profession lias only to follow the
smell of the menagerie, which is wafted over
the bridge when the south breeze blows. It
is alleged that on a good day the odor of
Wirths’ animals can be detected in Yarra-
ville, but that is probably an error, for
Yarraville can compel the aroma of a dead
whale to retire in disorder.
At Hoyt’s (Melb.j this week William S.
Hart is following the old trail from infamy
to rectitude and showing all the phases of his
gallant character en route. The yarn is
entitled “The Tiger Man,” and a lot of the
tiger is beheld before the mild eyes of a
parson’s wife make the animal figuratively
eat out of her hand. A parson is also pro-
minent in “Tongues of Men,” featuring Con-
stance Collier and the comprehensive fury of
the same handsome lady when the good man
questions her mode of life. At Hoyt’s
Lyceum the bloodstain is conspicuous in
“Woman and the Law,” with Miriam Cooper
in front. Also, there is murder in the
Majestic’s main suit, “More Trouble,”
wherein the agonised visage of the leading
man, Frank Keenan, is enlarged to the nth
magnitude right up to the camera. Anybody
who wants the physiognomical particulars of
a hard parent, worried by the exploits of an
unusual son, needs only to study Keenan at
the Majestic Theatre. Belle Bennett follows
him in the strenuous Alaskan fiction, “Ashes
of Hope,” but her unexaggerated perform-
ance seems colorless after the facial frenzy of
the other.
The Nationalist press has shoved the pre-
ferential-voting system right under the nose
of the Federal Government, insisting on
immediate action. A decade ago, when there
were five minority-vote Liberals in the Iteps.
to one Laborite thus returned, the Argus
made it a practice to point to the case of the
single Laborite (ignoring that of the five
Liberal members) as an awful example of
what could happen with a split vote. Grand-
ma did this in order to scare ambitious
Liberal candidates off the grass selected for
its own pets; yet little was ever said in those
days about any alteration of the Common-
wealth Electoral Act to put matters on an
equitable basis all round. But with the Swan
seat gone to Labor, through the “intrusion”
of a country party man, and with dreadful
things impending at Corangamite on Decem-
ber 14, the Argus forthwith took to de-
manding that “serious consideration” should
be given to the new Commonwealth Electoral
Bill and the introduction of the system of
preferential voting. The old sheet to-day
points admiringly to the fairness of the pre-
ferential plan, which looks so much fairer
now that the existing method seems likely to
cause trouble in the Nationalist camp. So
far, four parties have decided to go for
Corangamite, split or no split—the Re-
turned Soldiers’ National, the Farmers’
Union, the O.L.P. and the A.W.N.L.-Nation-
alist combine, and great will be the tumult
and the shouting.
A quaint municipal contest is going
on at time of writing at Caulfield
(Vic.), where a wowser and a sport
are battling for a vacant seat in the council.
The wowser faction is represented by John
Packer, the good young man who, before the
war, had himself tossed out of the Labor-
party because he barracked over unctuously
for “amicable relations” between boss and
bossed. After the burst-up, John was given
a secretarial screw of £6 a week, and encour-
aged to form an independent workers’ union
—or, as it was then weirdly named, the
Society of Free and Accepted Workmen.
When that job wore thin, Packer started a
pot-and-pan shop, and, later on, an auction-
eering business, with satisfactory cash re-
sults. This is his second try for a seat
among the Caulfield bumbles, and he is being
opposed by Fred Porter, who runs a city
school of muscle-culture and biff and is
nowadays a property-owner of some calibre.
Public meetings held by the parties are pro-
viding a good deal of free entertainment.
“A Gallery Critic”: There are plenty of
reasons why sound judges have a good-
humored contempt for the ex-Labor section of
the Federal Cabinet. The least exasperating
of them is Poynton, but he is a very average
politician who tries to look large by self-
inflation. But take George Foster Pearce, a
colorless carpenter of no strong convictions
unless political expediency is one. Hughes
is his maker and his mirror, but though
they differ widely in the ordinary manly
qualities, and are almost antipathetic in
temperament, they are brothers by the tie
of mutual self-preservation. Webster is a
mixture of artlessness and cunning, but the
real Webster is not proclaimed by his politi-
cal stupidities. William is tenacious of
office for the all that it means. Jensen is
the parvenu, and has all the ornate signs
of the type. He likes motor-cars and dinners,
swell company and fat cigars. You catalogue
him at once by the monstrous gold watch-
chain he wear with evening-dress and the
awful passion he shows for fancy boots.
Russell is the worker of the team, but he
has the quality of mind that might have been
got .at a remnant sale. But if you want to
realise the general deficiency, contrast them
with the staid and unassuming Watt, Groom,
Glynn and Millen. Personally and politi-
cally, Hughes’ gang is ruined "by the 'com-
parison.

•Exclusive of Replacement and Depreciation Fund.
The net profits shown in the table are the
figures given by the directors. Whether the
£137,816 was the true net profit for the half-
year The Bulletin does not know—nor
does anybody except the very few inside. In
past balance-sheets the directors certainly
did not disclose all the profit made ; for in-
stance, in 1910, they admitted that for 15
years they had been purchasing properties in
Fiji out of profits. The result is shown in
the table: in 1916 assets were written up by
no less than £3,250,000 and bonus shares
were issued for an equal amount in a new
co., which was then formed to take over the
Maoriland and Fiji interests. A directorate
which can shake 3J millions —equal to the
entire former watered capital—out of its
sleeve in this way cannot expect its figures
to be taken -too seriously. It is a notable
feature in the history of the C.S.R. Co. that
no matter what new troubles confront the
management it£ disclosed profits are not
affected to any extent. Taxation nowadays
is, of course, taking a larger bite, and for the
current year it is anticipated that the co.
will be paying out almost twice as much in
this way as it did two years ago. But it is
not much use considering the operations of
the local co. without including the results of
the M.L. and Fiji co., and the latter concern
issues its accounts only once a year—to
March 31. The effect of the division of Aus-
tralian and outside interests has been that
shareholders in the Australian co. get 04 p.c.
per annum on their capital, instead of the
former 124 p.c. But as they also receive 6
p.c. p.a. on their bonus capital in the M.L.
and Fiji, concern the return has been the
same as it used to be since the capitalisation
of a quarter of a million of reserves in 1913.
Looking back over the past 10 years gives
an amazing record of this mammoth concern.
Since 1907 no new capital has been got in :
but in that year besides the £225,000 raised
by the issue of 15.000 £2O shares, for which
only £l5 was paid, £75,000 of accumulated
profit was capitalised. That brought the
paid-up capital to £2,500,000. The paid-up
capital of the parent co. alone is now
£3.250,000, and every penny of that three-
quarters of a million represents capitalised
profit. Here is a short history of what has
happened since 1908

Of the figures in the last line £78,701 repre-
sents additions to reserves in the parent co.
in the 10 years after £750,000 had been capi-
talised, while the balance of £384,678 repre-
sents the reserves accumulated by the M.L.
and Fiji co. to March 31 last. It is a glit-
tering record ; but there’s little likelihood of
the performance being repeated. In fact
the Ryan Government is looking at the co.
with such a cold eye that the chairman
wept a few words at the recent meeting of
shareholders:—■
Despite the hostile official attitude in Queensland,
the co.’s interests have not been prejudiced in that
State since I last addressed you, because the agree-
ment made between the Federal and Queensland
Governments for acquiring the sugar of the 1918 and
1919 seasons provided that there should be no change
in the existing position until these crops had been
dealt with. Meantime things may alter for the better
in politics there, and this seems very desirable. So
far as we are concerned, we would be glad if the
million and a half we have laid out in that State
had been invested elsewhere.
The directors probably don’t mean all that.
The co. has had a gorgeous time in Banana-
land in the past; but it seems certain that
when the present arrangement with the
Commonwealth Government expires the
Ryan Ministry is determined to regulate the
co.’s operations in the Northern State.
Whether the Government will succeed is
another matter. Others have tried to har-
ness the C.S.R., and have failed. Few con-
cerns possess a management which can show
so much fight, and it can be guaranteed that
w'hat is coming to the co. in Bananaland is
not going to be taken quietly.

Here is another very striking instance of
what Protection can do for Australian in-
dustry—even if it is only a temporary Pro-
tection afforded by a mad Kaiser sooling his
tin-iish on to the world’s shipping and inter-
fering with imports. But there is no reason
whatever why practically every rubber
article at present imported should not be
manufactured locally. Rubber is being pro-
duced, in many cases by Australian capital,
at our Northern doorstep, and the manu-
facturing cos. have proved that they can
turn out high-class products. The average
value of the total imports of rubber and
rubber goods into the Commonwealth for
the two years 1915-16 and 1916-17 was over
a million and a quarter, and in the latter
year almost £352,000 was crude and sheet
rubber. That leaves about £900,000 repre-
senting the value of manufactured goods
imported. There are thus fine opportunities
ahead of the industry in Australia. The fly
in the ointment is that nobody knows what
the tariff-shirking politicians are going to do.
If, when conditions become normal again,
Australia is to become a dumping ground
for foreign manufactures, the outlook for
Australian industry is very grey.
Shortly after the war started the Dunlop
Rubber Co. saw the possibilities ahead, and
two and a half years ago reconstructed with
a view to getting in new capital. This shows
how the concern has grown in 10 years :-r—

During the past 12 months a little over
£IOO.OOO of new capital has been got in.-
But the business has grown so big that be-
sides the paid-up capital of £998,520 at July
31 the co. was also working on a bank over-
draft of £86,532, denosits £84,042, and a
£12,000 mortgage. When the directors are
satisfied that they can hold the new business
they have acquired they will probably raise
still further new capital.
It will be noticed that reserves in the
table are labelled “nominal.” This is
because of the goodwill item in the balance-
sheet, which stands at £lBO,OOO. It is this
paper’s usual practice to show reserves less
intangible assets. In this case, however,
the matter is complicated by the inclusion of
certain rights, etc., and to get over the diffi-
culty the reserves are shown as nominal only.
If the wiiole of the £lBO,OOO were treated as
a hypothetical asset then there would be
£135,090 of the capital not represented by
tangible assets. _ There is no doubt, however,
that the goodwill of the Dunlop Co. is at
present worth a lot. That is due to good
management and the reputation Dunlop
goods have earned. Under other conditions
the value of goodwill might be worth very
little. Stock is a big item in this business
at present, and £688,278 is tied up in this
way. In freeholds and leaseholds there
is £143,790: book debts total £169,337;
and there is £49,848 in War Loan, cash, etc.
More or less liquid assets amount to £907,463
and liabilities £242,546.
The Dunlop co. some time ago intro-
duced a sort of employees’ profit-sharing
scheme into the business. Shares are ac-
quired through an employees’ association
by the payment of small instalments, and
the inducement to purchase these shares is
that the employee with a holding of under
fdOO gets another 5 p.c. p.a. in addition to
the dividend declared by the co. Thus for
the past year the employees got a 15 p.c.
div. On the fourth hundred 4 p.c. additional
div, is paid ; and on the fifth (where the scheme
stops), 3 p.c. additional. The directors state
that this method of profit-sharing has taken
on so well that SO p.c. of the employees are
now in the share register.

This co. started manufacturing in 1910; so
by the. time Wilhelm created a demand for
khaki it had established itself in a nice posi-
tion to undertake war contracts. During
1917, however, no military work was done,
but the slump in profits shown in the table
was due to the setting aside of £8059 to
meet war-time profits taxation. During the
latter portion of the past year the mill was
requisitioned by the Defence Department to
supply flannel, and towards the close of the
term the whole* of the plant was entirely
devoted to military orders. Since 1914 the
co. has done very well, as these figures show:
4 914. 1917. 1918.

of the “other assets” is made up
of War Loan and cash. During the year a
further 10,000 £1 shares were issued and
taken up at a premium of 10s. So capital
has been almost doubled in four years. Other
liabilities have decreased by £11,858. • In the
meantime £14,143 has been put into pro-
perty, buildings and plant; there is £BOB7
more in stock; and £lO,lOB more in liquid
assets. So in addition to paying dividends
averaging 12$ p.c. p.a., meeting war-time
profits taxation and providing for deprecia-
tion the co. has improved its position by
something like £13,350 in the four years.
Considering its age and modest beginnings
(paid up capital was only £14,218 when the
looms were first set at work), this Warr-
nambool co. has probably created a record
for Australian milling concerns. What its
future is The Bulletin cannot forecast;
but it will be a national disgrace if the Aus-
tralian mills are not kept fully employed.
Again it is a case of giving the industry
adequate Protection to compete with the
foreign cheap-labor mills. This co. admits
that it wants to extend its plant, but the
politician is such a poor friend to Aus-
tralian industry that the directors are not
taking any risks just at present. This co.
has had one bitter experience of the politi-
cian's assistance: being a young concern
when war began, the absurd war-time profits
tax hit it particularly hard.

This little co. is one of the few Australian
shipping concerns which have not been in a
position to grow very fat out of the war. It
serves the fertile but more or less somnolent
N. S. AVales South Coast, and because there
are no war risks it has not much opportunity
to make war profits. Nevertheless, the co. is
doing considerably better than it used to, and
The Bulletin won’t guarantee that all the
profits made are disclosed. As is usual in
shipping balance-sheets profits are shown
after providing for depreciation, and whether
fair allowance or more has been made there
are no means of ascertaining, though the
balance-sheet figures indicate that the provi-
sion now made is much greater than it used
to be. Further, there is a “repairs, public
risk and contingency account” which has
grown this way: 1914 and 1915, £3500;
1916. £5000; 1917, £8500; 1918, £12,500.
Possibly some of that £9OOO accumulated in
three years may not be required as a set-off
against wear and tear, etc.; hi which case
the profits have been better than shown in
the table. However, there has been a con-
siderable improvement in the earnings during
the past couple of years. Up to two years
ago the figures were disappointing, for with
a bigger and more efficient fleet the co. was
making very little more than it used to
many years ago. Going back 10 years gives
this comparison :—•
1908. 1914. 1918.
Liabilities .. £1,654 £9,461 £7,041

Liquid assets . . 14,201 6,465 44,136
Other assets .. 3,160 3,502 4,439
The growth of liquid assets indicates liow
things have gone since just after the war
began. In 1014 liabilities exceeded liquid
assets by almost £3OOO, now there is a sur-
plus of 'liquid assets of over £37,000. In the
meantime, the little Hillmcads, acquired
second-hand by the co. 10 years ago, is appa-
rently the only vessel sold. Nowadays the
10 p.c. dividend is coming to shareholders
with much greater ease than the former
7 p.'c.

But don’t take too much notice of that 21$
p.c. div. The co. is now in its 34th year, and
was formed in the Melbourne boom days.
When the bubble burst the Federal Palace
Co. found itself in the casualty lists. In 1897
the management set out to clean up the
mess, and discovered that £109,989 repre-
sented nothing more than the hot-air of the
boom. Paid-up capital was £122,752, and
£60,000 had been borrowed on debentures.
Shares had been paid to 19s. each, and, to
cover the loss, had to be written down to
2s. Paid capital is now £13,493 —127,211
shares paid to 2s. lid. each and 270 shares
paid to 3s. The co. is gradually paying off
its mortgage—it now stands at £34,l32—and
instead of writing these amounts off assets
they are added to a mortgage redemption
fund, which now amounts to £14,000. Pro-
bably some time in the future this accumula-
tion will be used towards restoring some of
the lost capital. This shows how the
balance-sheet figures have moved in 15 years
and recently:—
1903. 1913. 1917. 1918.
Liabilities. . . . £59,932 £39,904 £37,047 £36,151
Liquid assets . . 2,752 3,955 5,627 6,484
£57,180 £35,949 £31,420 £29,667
Owing to increases in the cost of provisions
and in the wages-sheet recent years have
been difficult. Net profits for the past three
years have amounted to only £10,538,
compared with £16,254 for the three years
prior to the war.

Last year 186,0001 b. were harvested, com-
pared with 143,6001 b. for 1917. But though
the cost of production at just over Is. per lb.
was practically the same, the market was not
so good. For 1917 the 101,9051 b. sold real-
ised an average price of 2s. Bd. per lb.; last
year 130,6951 b. were sold for an average
of 2s. 3d per lb. The estate consists of 653
acres at Seremban (F.M.S.), and about 500
acres were being tapped last year—repre-
senting about 53,000 trees. Tlie harvest of
186.0001 b. thus gave a very good average of
3721 b. to the acre, an improvement of 321 b.
per acre compared with the previous year.
These crop figures show how the estate has
progressed :—•
1911. . 2,6501 b.
1912.. 8,7901 b.
1913.. 17,4501 b.
1914.. 30,9101 b.
1915.. 50,1301 b.
1916.. 103,0001 b.
1917.. 143,6001 b.
1918.. 186,0001 b.
For the current year the crop is expected to
reach the 200.0001 b.-mark. The estate is
reported to be “in excellent condition,” free
from pests and diseases, and the co. is appa-
rently well situated as to labor. The total
labor force is now 236, including 58 Tamils,
102 Chinese and 46 Javanese. “The whole
of our force,” says the manager, “is settled
and contented and is easily added to.”

ket price and the estate is free from cyclones
and disease, there should be very profitable
work ahead. Last year’s net profit was
equal to almost 224 p.c. of the paid-up capital
of £30,000. The cost of the estate was
£12,018, and £21,179 has been spent on
development. Buildings, plant, etc., as writ-
ten down stand in the books at £5440. The
value of stocks on hand, together with cash,
amount to £7616. All liabilities total only
£lOB9, so the position is very comfortable.
I). G. Lumsden puts the Mt. Lveli profits
for 1917-18 at £247,225. This is a drop of
£20,000 below the previous year’s return, but
the co. hands out 3s. 3d. in dividends for
the 12 months instead of a half-crown for the
previous year. Of the profit of £247.228,
£(‘>4,ooo is set aside as a provision for taxa-
tion. Thus more than a quarter of the profit
goes to the Federal and State Treasuries.
Still the Commonwealth grab may be looked
at as a due reward for getting Britain to
pay big prices for our copper. Depreciation
allowance jumps to over £50,000, while the
writing-down of prospecting and develop-
ment by £18,022 means that £14,000 less is
provided than last year, the reason being that
there is not the same strain on that item as
in the old days, when the North and South
Lyell were needing a heavy outlay. By
setting £60,000 aside as a special appropria-
tion for plant, the co. won’t have to think
over a possible war-time levy on that sum.
On what is this cash to be spent—Mt. Reid
or Mt. Lyell?
Broken Hill has a suspicion that some-
thing may be done with the old Round Hill,
where Matthews and John Warren spent
many a good pound in the hunt after the
shoot of ore from which the chlorides on the
top of the hill have come. The property is
one of the old-fashioned mineral freeholds,
and the whisper is that somebody has it on
tribute from the Brandon crowd, but on what
terms is not announced.
Latest reports from the old Hill End field
(N.S.W.) show that improved values are
being taken out of the Amalgamated, where
the tributors have treated a further 30 tons
of stone for 160 ounces of gold. The returns
are much above the average, and when the
year closes the balances will show out more
favorably than last year, when only 130 tons
were taken out of the old show for 206
ounces of gold. The Deep Levels Co., which
was formed to test the ground lying below
any of that already touched, is doing a lot
of preparatory work. The break-through from
No. 2 to No. 3 level has not yet been com-
pleted, as had been anticipated, and until
this is done little other serious work will be
undertaken.
* * * *
The accidental discovery of a fresh make
of good-looking quartz at the 150 ft. level of
the Mt. Dudley is further evidence of the
interesting make of country in the Trunkey
district (N.S.W.). Reefs wander all over
■the place and bob up at the most unexpected
points. But they as often cut out as they
happen, which has given the old field a
reputation for patchiness. The Mt. Dudley
management, however, declares itself satis-
fied with the permanency of prospects, and is
hopeful of consistently good stone through-
out the long line of quartz as yet untapped.
The stone now being fed to the 10-head
battery is being extracted from the lower
drive. The first actual returns are awaited
with wide interest.

There is a mining revival on the Hastings
River, N. S. Wales North Coast. The Mt.
Jasper copper-mine is said to promise well.
Reynolds, Marshall and party (who some
time ago sold out of Mt. Brown), recently took
up the Mt. Jasper lease. On the surface five
distinct lodes can be traced for several hun-
dred yards in a northerly and southerly direc-
tion, and where they have been crosscut in-
dicate an underlay from east to west. The
shaft is down about 80ft.. and the lode where
cut has shown promise. A lease to the south
of the Jasper has been taken up by another
party. On the Upper Hastings is another
copper show known as Morcom’s. The assays
from specimens taken from this show are
said to have given a good percentage of silver
as well as of copper, and developments are
being watched with interest.

That it was intended to bring the Edna
May div. down from 2s. to the old Is. did
not leak out in time for the bears to cut
into the melon-patch on this occasion. With
a lower yield from the ore, to say nothing
of the using up of the accumulated tails,
there had to be a whittling of the div., and it
will surprise most people if Edna May. out of
its present mine, ever gets back to the florin
distribution again. Costs cannot be reduced,
and the shoot at the Deeps boundary is not
only shorter than at the level above, but is
not as rich. The Taxation Commissioner is
also taking a deeper cut from Westralian
mines. Next door Edna Central is working
a bad passage in picking up the Holmes
shoot from the Consolidated lease, but it has
had luck in the better-grade material show-
ing in the last few cuts on the old reef at
No. 4 level. With that thrown in ore
reserves are pretty low, and it will take a
lot of skill to keep totals up to the past six
months’ average.
Mines Inspector Crabb has formed a
favorable impression of the new gold
find at the head of the the Ivurra-
wang woodline (W.A.). He says, in
a report to the Minister, that the reef
gold found on the field is contained in small
lenses or veiulets of quartz forming part of
a fair-sized schistose formation, which occurs
in country similar to that in which several
of the rich mines in the State are situated.
He suggests that a geological survey be
made of the locality. He also has a few
words to say about the alluvial workings,
which he states are confined to a small area
and are likely to be worked out very soon.

After several reconstructions and many
disappointments Greenfinch (W.A.) is in-
clined to give up. The manager is getting
ready to go, exemption is being sought, and
the plant on the co.’s holdings at Westonia
has been handed over lo an agent with power
to act. Nearly every show on the field was
offered to this unfortunate concern at one
time or another; it could have bought the
Edna May for a song, and subsequently the
Central and the Deeps for very little.
Golden Butterfly (W.A.) has had another
reverse. This time it has “given in’’ at the
Mclntosh mine, Parkers Range, on the South
Yilgarn field. A lot concerning the rich pos-
sibilities of this show has appeared in print
during the past year or two, but the show
doesn’t appear to have much v&lue at depth.
So far the Butterfly has made four attempts
to soar into the realms of wealth, and has
been winged every time. Want of funds, and
inability to raise any more, will probably pre-
vent it trying again.
At last Edna May Consolidated Extended
is a living entity; but the cruel hands of the
Federal Treasury officials display no regard
to the promoting element, so no paid-ups fall
to anyone, only 45,000 shares go to those
who like to pay up 2s. Gd. each. The lure
to do this is that a belief exists that the run
of gneissic schist in which all the mines
worth the name at Westonia live, may go
past the boundary line of the Edna Consoli-
dated into the Extended lease. Mick Wil-
liams, of the Edna May, has fancies that way,
and he is also supported in his theory by some
shrewd geologists. To settle the matter the
present shaft close to the border line is to be
deepened. Would it not be better to get a
drill at work so as to put down a fair run
of test bores? If only greenstone is to be
found, then it will be better to let mining
alone.

The Auckland, Leonora (W.A.), out of
which the New Chaffers Co. reckoned it was
going to make its fortune, is now idle. The
trial crushing was much below official ex-
pectations. and it is doubtful if any more
money will be wasted on the property.
* * * *
Gold Blocks, Leonora (W.A.), has again
closed down,, this time, it is stated, for want
of labor. Judging from past results the
Board would be doing shareholders a good
turn if it decided to close down altogether.
* * * *
A line from Centralia :
Director of Mines T. G. Oliver and chief-warden
E. C. Playford have just been having a look at the
Wauchope Creek and Hatches Creek wolfram fields.
They are situated in the Davenport Ranges, roughly
570 miles north of Oodnadatta and 550 miles south
from the Katherine. Since its discovery by W.
Curtis early in 1917, Wauchope Creek has sent away
87 tons of dressed ore, averaging 68 p.c. tungstic
acid, and it was estimated by Oliver that the dressed
ore produced, but not despatched at the time of his
visit in August, would amount to another 25 tons, or
a total production of 112 tons. Twenty-two men were
on the field, and all of them were satisfied with
prospects and were making good money. Water is
becoming scarce, but a Government boring party has
started work. The main features of the country are
quartzite-capped ridges, separated by valleys about
200 to 400 yards in width, and some of these big
gutters can be followed practically in a straight line
for over 10 miles. At intervals branch creeks have
formed and cut through narrow gorges in the big
ridges, and junction with the main creeks at right
angles. These smaller channels drain short valleys
parallel with the main cut out. These pockets or
“pounds,” as they are called locally, contain the
wolfram-bearing quartz reefs. The wolfram occurs,
unassociated with other minerals, in quartz veins from
lin. to 3ft. in thickness, and 10 distinct reefs or
veins over 6in. in width have been proved to be
wolfram-bearing.
Ore-dressing methods are primitive. The ore, after
being broken from the reef, is looked over by the
local binghi, his missus and the kid, and the best
picked out and bagged. The more silicious part of
the ore is stacked on wood and burned, rendering the
quartz more friable, but a big loss of fine wolfram
occurs. Reduction of the ore is done with the spring
dolly or with a hammer and flat stones, and here
again Black Brother is given a job. It is then
roughly classified by sieving, and the oversize jigged
and the fines sluiced. The rejects from the treat-
ment are still rich in wolfram, and one party recently
sold their reject heaps for £2O to a new hand, and
he expects to get over £7OO worth of wolfram from
the lot. Oliver saw the result of several days’ work,
and reckons the new hand has under-estimated his
recovery.
The tribute agreements prevailing on the field
are most detrimental to good mining, for any-
one who happens to wander along that way is given
a tribute on the sole condition that he sells his ore
to the owner at about £BO per ton. The result is
that the greatest quantity of ore is rooted out in the
shortest time possible regardless of method or future
development of the mine. Under present transport
conditions only the very best ore can be worked, and
hundreds of tons of stuff are scrapped which would
yield a handsome profit with modern reduction and
ore-dressing machinery. What is wanted is pleiffy
of capital and railway communication.

The 10-head mill at the. molybdenite show
at Moliagul East (Vic.) is ready for work,
and when the concentrating plant is com-
plete a start will be made to treat something
like 150 tons ore a week. Ore awaiting
treatment is reckoned to be 1 p.c. stuff. One
of the big lodes on the property contains a
pipe 2ft. wide and worth 15 p.c. By the
way, molybdenite was spoken of at the half-
yearly meeting as being worth £525 per ton,
but that price is for a pure concentrate
(100 p.c.), which is very rarely obtained.
Australian molybdenite concentrates average
from 80 p.c. to 06 p.c. of molybdenite.
From E. Livi, secretary, Altona Beach
Estates, Ltd,: —
Re the par concerning the Altona brown-coal mine
(B. 24/10/’18), you assume that the mine could be
put in working order and turn out coal without any
large outlay. Unfortunately such is not the case—
the prime necessity is capital. Hoover’s visit is
ancient history, and his judgment was based on the
erroneous supposition of water trouble. Mr. D. A.
W. Robertson, in his report (March, 1918), says:
“The make of water is not heavy. .. .Efficient ventila-
tion will permit of a steam or electric pump being
installed in a position to intercept the water at its
source.” Re Amalgamated Zinc, the explanation, is
known to most Victorian mining men. The require-
ments of Victoria in the near future will absorb all
that Altona, Morwell and several other brown-coal
mines can produce, especially when the State locomo-
tives are using powdered coal.
The Bulletin did not say that Altona could
be got to the producing Stage “without any
large outlay.” The claim that an expendi-
ture of only £26,000 was necessary to obtain
an output of 1000 tons daily was made by
a persistent Altona barracker.
* * * *
Laloki copper (Papua) is able to give a
slightly better account of itself now that a
two-mile road from Sapphire Creek to the
mine has been formed, and the workings
from the 230 ft. east crosscut have opened a
supply of *8 p.c. ore. The mine was origi-
nally owned by a syndicate, which trans-
ferred its / mining rights to the Great Fitz-
l'oy on a royalty basis. A revised agree-
ment with the Great Fitzroy debenture-
holders gives the Laloki co. the right to pay
for the propery in instalments, in 1920,
1922 and 1925. Steam tractors are to be
experimented with, and if they prove a suc-
cess ore can be carried to Port Moresby (20
miles) at a cost of 15s. per ton. An
electrolytic method of treatment is talked
of.
* * * #
Hampden Cloncurry (Q.) has declared a
2s. div. (£35,000). Though the chance of
realising on some of the heavy stocks of
copper has improved slightly, the future of
the market is uncertain. Hampden’s reserves
on February 28 were 266,000 tons ore con-
raining 17,300 tons copper. Large quan-
tities of ore are in course of development, and
the latest developments at the Answer and
Hampden mines are very favorable. Hamp-
den Cloncurry has produced 38,000 tons of
copper altogether. Dividends total £437,500,
and no less than Bs. per share (£140,000) was
paid in 1916.
* * * *
Though Mt. Cuthbert (Q.) has been doing
better with the smelter and developments at
the Kalkadoon and Orphan mines have been
encouraging, shares are selling at about one-
third of their face value. For the quarter
ended September the output was 826 tons
copper from 14,591 tons ore. An average ex-
traction of between 5 p.c. and 6 p.c. is fairly
good considering the increase of ore smelted
(copper-bearing limestone is now classed as
ore).
* * * *
McDonald’s Kitchener Molybdenite (N.Q.)
has got its mill in order, and w r hen last heard
from was about to start crushing. At No. 3
level the north-east drive is in 37ft., and at
that point the face was 54in. wide, with an
estimated value of 2i p.c. molybdenite. About
15 tons of ore are being raised daily.
The Herberton district (N.Q.) is noted
for its tin lodes. The claims are, as a rule,
small but numerous, and sometimes rich in
tin oxide. In September the various bat-
teries on this field crushed 1742 tons from
no less than 61 claims for a return of 49
tons of concentrates valued at £9499. The
best returns: Robinson’s, 15 tons ore, £721;
Extenuate, 14 tons, £555; Myera, 31 tons,
£551; Native Bee, 21 tons, £37S; so these
four little claims averaged over £27 per ton
compared with a general average for the
whole field of about £5 per ton. Alluvial tin
realised £4232, but large quantities of wash-
dirt are stacked in the dry season, so returns
are irregular.

The approach of summer makes it imperative for
every stock-owner to give a thought to the purifica-
tion of drinking water for his stock. If he is content
to let them drink muddy, slimy water he cannot
expect them to keep in good condition. All over the
State careful stock-owners are using Aluminoferric in
the proportion of one pound to every 2000 gallons of
water. It ensures pure liquid water in dams, wells,
tanks, etc., at very low cost, by precipitating all
impurities and leaving the water clear and pure,
free from any ingredient injurious to man or beast.
Let us go into details telling you how it will be to
your advantage to use Aluminoferric. William

THE END OF IT FOR EVER.


PERSONAL
ITEMS
Newton Moore, who has been elected to
the House of Commons for the end of the
late George Reid’s term, will not occupy the
position for long, as under the Redistribution
Act his borough will disappear; but having
got a start, Westralia’s ex-Agent-General
may find another constituency. It was
thought at one time that he would return to
Australia and enter Federal politics; but it
now appears as if he will stick to London.
The Cold Country seems to suit him.
_ Major Sir Walter Barttelot, reported
killed at Teheran, is the last of Governor-
General Denman’s staff to be ticked off.
Major Quilter, Captains Nutting and Curwen
have already gone. Tall, fair, a Guardsman,
polo-player and fine all-round sport, Bart-
telot was the distinguished type of English-
man. He once rode alone from Port Darwin
to Townsville just to see the country. Aus-
tralians first knew him in the South African
war, where, as a subaltern in the Cold-
streams, he was on the staff of Colonel
E. C. I. Williams (also killed in this war),
who commanded a column to which the 2nd
N.S.W. Mounted Rifles (Lassetter’s) were
attached.
Dead in Adelaide, at 71, William Cleland,
’whose life-work was the care of the insane.
As, soon as he took his degree at Edinburgh,
in ’76, he specialised in this subject, and re-
turned to Adelaide in time to help Dr. Pat-
terson get the North Terrace institution
done away with. Dr. Cleland had charge of
the Parkside Asylum for 36 years before re-
tiring. He leaves two sons, of whom one is
in the N. S. Wales Public Health Depart-
ment and the other in France. Edward
Cleland, K.C., is his brother.
Lance-corporal Jack Carroll, V.C., is too
modest for anything but a Digger. On the
way from Melbourne to Fremantle he left
the boat at Adelaide and tried to get home
to Kalgoorlie unobserved by the trans-rail-
way. News that he was on the train leaked
out, so the mayors of Kalgoorlie and Boulder
met him at the station and almost dragged
him to the town hall for a public reception.
During the proceedings Carroll looked as
miserable as if he were a Hun prisoner, and
his only response to all the fuss was a
stand-to-attention and a salute.
Richard Butler, S.A. Treasurer, put in a
good word to a Leg. Council Repatriation
Committee for Britten Jones, who has, in
the opinion of many, had the land-purchase
sins of the late Vaughan Government put
on his back as scapegoat. Butler said that
the chaos in the Land Office was made worse
by the fact that the Government has lost the
best valuator g.A. ever had in E. B. Jones,
who unquestionably had the best knowledge
of land matters of any man in S.A. at any
time.
Gone out at Narromine (N.S.W.), at 40
years of age, George Berryman, who was
selected as Progressive candidate for Castle-
reagh at the last State elections, but made
way for Private Guy Arkins. Berryman was
secretary of the Castlereagh F. and S. Asso-
ciation, and was known by every cocky
throughout the West. For years he was
president of the Narromine A. P. and H.
Association.
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.
MRS. SOAKE: “ This is disgraceful. It’s
enough to make me divorce you.”
MR. SOAKE: “Don’t trouble, m’dear. Jush
lesh have an armishice to-night an ’ I’ll
abdicate to-morrer.”
“G.A.”: James Collins (known as “Col-
lins” to local society), staff clerk, messenger,
office-keeper and attendant at South Aus.
Government House, has fetched and carried
for six State cocked hats. A discreet worth
of Ireland man, 65 years of age, Collins has
been 23 years at Government House, and
has advised and taken orders
from Powell Buxton, Tennyson,
Way, Le Hunt, Bosanquet and
Galway. Collins is talkative
regarding his experiences out-
side, but keeps mum about what
he has seen and heard in his
present position.
G. Mussen, industrial adviser
of the Broken Hill Associated
Smelters and a war-time dis-
covery, is the man who has kept
the Port Pirie Smelters free
from industrial disturbances
during the war. In his opinion,
“it’s a race between revolution
and the betterment of the con-
ditions of the people in every
country.” Anyhow, a policy is
being pursued to ensure con-
cord between the co. and its
employees, and it is proving
successful. In August last year
when Australian workers were
howling incoherently about
general strike ’ Pirie workers refused to
down tools, to the great disappointment of
union leaders. Incidentally, the Associated
Sinelters are supplying employees with boots
and other lines direct from the manufac-
ture! s, thus doing away with the middlemen’s
profits.
Wai-hoi”: A bluff old card was Johnny
Udman, skipper for a long time of the
Albany and other craft on the Nor’-West
Coast. One time when Johnny was steer-
lng his ship south from Wyndham he was
taken seriously ill, and at each nort on the
down run the local pills was called aboard
to examine the old man. Broome’s doctor
in those days was notoriously deaf, and,
after flashing a stethoscope and sounding
the ancient salt, he observed: “Well, Cap-
tain, I’m sorry to say your heart is bad,
very bad.’’ Came the answer straight and
very angry: “That’s not my heart, you
fool, that’s the freezer aft.” Anyway
the old man’s heart went on strike soon
after we hit Fremantle.
A man bearing a name historic in Aus-
tralia died at Woolwich, Parramatta River
(N.S.W.), last week. He was Frederick
Mansfield Oakes, son of the late R. H.
Oakes, of Bathurst, and a grandson of
Francis Oakes, one of the original mission-
aries to Tahiti, who, on being expelled from
the island by the natives, became Chief Con-
stable at Parramatta in succession to George
Barrington, the nimble-fingered gentleman so
prominent in the days when Botany Bay
was one of the English Government’s
scandals.
“A Brother Officer”: His
name on the stage is, I think,
“Arthur Riscoe.” At any rate
he was well known in Australia
as a member of the “Dandies.”
To-day he is Arthur Boorman,
lieutenant in one of the crack
battalions of the A.I.F. Up
till a very short time ago we
all looked on him as—well, as
a comedian. But a few days
ago he led his platoon through
several hundred Huns, a hail of
machine-gun fire, and that
deadly stuff “ground shrapnel.”
He was right out in front all
the way of those hell-swept two
kilometres, and when he reached
his objective he had just six men
left. Hun machine-gunners
with Red Cross badges on their
arms surrendered by the dozen
to that courageous little party.
Exit from the permanent force
of S.A. defence, De Passey, after
over 40 years of service. He
came to Australia from the
British army, and when the
Boer trouble arose he went to
South Africa with the Austra-
lians and with the unusual ex-
perience of a previous campaign
in that country against the
Zulus. He thought himself still
young enough for active service
in the present war, but his ser-
vices at this end in training and
organising were too valuable to
lose. He did not receive a com-
mission till 1901, and, though he
retires with the rank of lieut.-
Colonel, the burly soldier will
perhaps be best remembered as
Sergeant-Major De Passey, in-
structor to Lancers and Light Ilorse in the
days before South Aus. had experienced any
active warfare.
“Billy B.’s” yarn :
Dr. Cahill, who died recently at Wellington (M.L.),
was at one time president of the local Medical
Association, and that body was at ’ daggers drawn
with the late W. C. Fitzgerald, a local chemist, be-
cause the latter was advertising, “Advice free. Why
consult a doctor There was some heated litigation
once or twice. A few days after one of the cases
Cahill was out visiting his patients when his horse
bo 1 ted and collided with a telegraph-post just opposite
Fitzgerald’s house. The groom was pitched on his
head and stunned, the vehicle badly smashed, the
horse fell but was not hurt, whilst the doctor was
pitched out unhurt and at onc-e sat on the nag’s
head to keep him quiet. Fitzgerald, who was in
his garden, was the first man on the scene, and see-
ing the doctor, his direst enemy, squatting on the
prad’s head, thought the opportunity too good to be
missed. He at once landed the doctor a couple of
tidy blows on the jaw, exclaiming: “You inhuman
brute to treat a poor dumb animal in that wav,’’ and
fled inside kicking what was left of Cahill’s bell-
topper over the nearest fence. When the crowd
gathered and straightened things up a bit Cahill
invaded Fitzgerald's premises, but could not per-
suade the latter to come out and have a few rounds
on the lawn. The Sydney boat left next day and
Fitzgerald thought a month in Australia would do
him no harm. When he returned the doctor’s Celtic
blood had cooled and the feud fizzled out.
The military veterans of South A.us. had
a corroboree the other night. Antill, the
State Commandant, was the guest, .and he
told many stories of his campaigns on Gal-
lipoli and in France. But some of the men who
listened could have beaten him in the matter of
personal interest. Warrant-officer Ilanley, for
instance, had marched to Kandahar with
Roberts, when in the Gordon Highlanders,
and he lay out on Majuba Hill alongside
lan Hamilton—both wounded. The memory
of Captain Moore, too, of the Navy, goes
back, to the Crimea war. He was in the
Baltic, and helped to fish up floating mines,
laid by the Russians of Kronstadt. They
were a novelty then, and were known as
“infernal machines.” But they were mild
things compared by modern standards. They
had only a 101 b. charge of gunpowder.
The firebrand among the Speck’s Legisla-
tors, Dave Dicker, came into undue promi-
nettce last session by
dropping* a chance
remark which was
construed into a
charge of prejudicing
recruiting. The record
of having secured more
recruits from his con-
stituency than any
other in Tassy was
probably responsible
for his escaping with
a £l5 fine. Impetuous
and outspoken, he is
the wittiest debater in
the Assembly. Self-
educated in the bush
he has had a try at
everything from swag-
carrying to squatting,
but the T 5 drought
and bush-fires returned
him to scratch. His
experiences are spread
all over Australia and
Maoriland.

The sudden passing of .Tim Mooney, secre-
tary of the Tasmanian branch of the Aus-
tralian Workers’ Union, removes another of
the principals who figured in the New Aus-
tralia experiment 25 years ago. It is only
a few months since the founder of the co-
operative settlement in Paraguay died.
Mooney, one of the stalwarts of bush union-
ism, attracted by the personal magnetism of
Lane, left with the pioneers in the Royal Tar
on July 31, 1893. At the time New Aus-
tralia was floated Mooney was a vigorous
Shearers’ Union organiser, and threw himself
heart and soul into the proposal to leave bad
“Old Australia” and set up a modern Utopia.
As one of the board of directors he was
present at the proclamation ceremony on
October 11, 1893, when the colony of New
Australia, at Las Avejos, was constituted by
Sefior Lopez, Paraguayan Minister for the
Interior. (Lopez, by the way, was a nephew
of President Lopez, who for five years fought
the combined armies of Brazil, Argentine and
Uruguay until he was killed.) The Minister
and several dignitaries were accompanied by
four soldiers as a bodyguard. The Para-
guayan flag was unfurled and the soldiers
fired a volley. As the emblem fluttered out
the settlers cheered, and Lopez dramatically
exclaimed: “That flag will protect you
and assure peace and justice for all.”
Mooney was a great supporter of Lane’s,
and, following on the split, accompanied
him to Cosmos. He returned to Austra-
lia to do recruiting for Paraguay, but
the collapse of the scheme resulted in his re-
maining in Australia.
Professor Jethro Brown, President of the
Industrial Court of South Australia, has
lately been somewhat cold in his attitude
towards the Government of the State. He
appears to be a bit crestfallen, because he
is treated as the poor relation of the
judiciary, _ and as the Government doesn’t
seem inclined to be a little more friendly,
rumors have been going the rounds that
Brown is trying to get back to his old posi-
tion as professor in the Adelaide University,
although that would mean a couple of hun-
dred pounds less a year. When the matter
was mentioned in the Assembly, one of the
Government supporters interjected anent
Brown’s prospective departure: “Let him
go !” _ Which rather confirmed the Laborites’
surmise that Brown’s recent pronouncement
on the living-wage question, when he in-
creased the subsistence level from 9s. to 10s.
od. a day, didn t find favor in Government
circles, arid that the Peake set would rather
see the last of the Professor.
EPITAPH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Death shall meet me on the winding way
’Twixt Day and Night, no coward shall he find ;
No craven weakling whimpering and blind
To the grim fate of my unconquering clay.
Nay, as he looks upon my visage grey,
Twisted with agonies of heart and mind,
I’ll meet him fearless in the fatal wind
That leads the dark, and to his cold face say:
“Yea, I have sinned, drunk deep of shame and sham :
Drawn steel and reddened earth with summer lit.
Yea, 1 have lived, laughed music and delight,
lint for thy pause I do not give a damn”. .. .
Mate, there’s a cigarette in my old kit....
The Dark Thing’s here. Quick! Greet him with a

A. T. Saunders, the prolific letter-writer
to the Adelaide dailies, gives the. Register
(5/11/’18) a note which ought to settle the
vexed question whether the dead gum pre-

“Her behavior at the cafe the other night
was simply shocking.”
"How dreadful!”
“Nonsense! Everybody there knew she was
a lady.”
served religiously at Glenelg is the real one
under which the province of S.A. was “pro-
claimed” on December 28, 1836. George
Stevenson, first clerk of the Council and edi-
tor of the Register, wrote in his own paper
in 1849:—•
It was yesterday 13 years since the writer of these
lines, in his official capacity, read to about 200
persons standing round, or in the shade of, a gum-
tree on the plain of Glenelg, still to be seen, a large
crooked arch remarkable for its appearance, his
Majesty’s proclamation.
The tree, now railed round, is a “crooked
arch” all right.
“Hiphen”: After the Battle of Dunsi-
nane, prior to the Norman Conquest, Siward
the Anglo-Dane, when his son Asbiorn’s
corpse was carried into camp by the Red
Cross bearers of the time, casually inquired
of the senior N.C.O. or nursing sister: “Are
all his wounds in front?” This is a dif-
ferent sort of war. One lad I saw brought
into a casualty clearing-station with his
body perforated like a sieve by shrapnel, told
the M. 0.: “I’ve got 16
Blightys and [proudly]
they’re all in front.”
Then he added, with a
grin on what remained
of his face: “I was
sittin’ wif me back to
the enemy.” Won-
der how the proud old-
timers would have
taken our flying iron-
mongery ?
The Inter-State Com-
missioners, inquiring
into the increased
charges for house rent
in Melbourne, aren’t
getting further ahead
with any speed, and
aren’t likely to. But
they have been filled to
the back teeth with this
sort of news: (1) Ex-
cept in a few isolated
cases, house rents have
been raised in recent
years by no more than
from 10 to 15 per cent.;
(2) few houses have
been built lately except
for the use of the owners
or for immediate sale;
(3) during the last
four years Melbourne
has been underbuilt by
at least 6000 houses;
and (4) the present
cost of erecting a four-
roomed house, with
appurtenances, would
be about £650 for brick
or £570 for wood. Ex-
perts further assured
the Commissioners that a fair return
of 8 per cent, gross only meant 6 per
cent, net; so that, allowing from £5O to £l5O
for the land, according to size and locality,
the man or institution who went in for
building and leasing decent workmen’s cot-
tages to-day would need to charge from 20s.
to 255. a week rent.
“A. 8.” : My batman on the troopship was
nicknamed “Windy Gus.” He was a cheery
old soul, and I’m sure had
been an undertaker’s assist-
ant. We were a few days’
sail from England, and well
in the danger zone, so the
boats were provisioned and
slung out-board, lifebelts
worn day and night, and the
Warning issued that any man
who fell overboard stayed
there, as we were not pulling
up this side of safety.
Windy moved gloomily, and
each morning when he pre-
sented the shaving-water,
told me he thought “it”
would happen soon. When
we were about 24 hours’
steam from port, I awoke
and found Gus taking a last'
look at me. With an attempt
at cheerfulness I inquired:
“How’s the weather, Gus?”
He solemnly put down my
boots, came close to the
bunk-side, and in a hollow,
blood-curdling whisper that
suggested listening Boche
submarines outside the port-
hole, said: “Well, sir, it’s
jist the sorter weather they
likes; jist enough lift on the
water to hide the periscopes.”
Australia's old friend apd viceroy, Dudley,
whose matrimonial affairs have recently been
before the eye of the Law in London, is a
peer who isn’t enjoying life. The arrange-
ment arrived at was that the peeress was to
have about two-thirds of the income to keep
house on for herself and the family, and as
±!JUOO is mentioned it appears that she could
face the butcher with the chop at the door
without misgivings concerning the bill. The
amount was to vary according to the income,
but the mention of £9OOO implies that Dud-
ley had still enough to buy a threepenny
cigar with until the war income-tax came to
pass. Now the peeress wants it decided that
the peer shall pay the very robust tax, and
if he does he may be left with a deficit. Lady
Dudley says she was unhappy in Ireland
and miserable in Australia, and has been
dejected since leaving Australia. She went
to Australia with reluctance, and left it in
a sepaiate ship ; but she endeavored to con-
ceal her troubles, in which she failed badly.
The attempt to let concealment prey on her
damaged cheek was apparently too public.
Dudley’s cheek was also apparent. Under
the separation agreement Dudley was to
spend a month every years at his wife’s
house, which would be very awkward if lie
got a three-years’ sentence, and he might
bring friends with him, provided they could
stand inspection. Friends who couldn’t

stand inspection were to be left outside on
the mat. Something was said in the court
about Dudley admitting that he was wholly
in fault, but it appears that he was always
willing to admit everything and anything
else that might be required. The pair give
the impression of a gay dog—not that Dud-
ley’s gaiety was conspicuous in Australia,
where he seemed rather morose than other-
wise—married to a lady with an air of
heavenly resignation. At latest advices, the
question of the income-tax was in suspense,
and considering the size of it, Dudley was in
suspense likewise.

“Dinkus”: Billjim would go to Hell for
hot water to brew tea with. When travelling
in France on troop trains I have seen, during
one of the frequent stops, mess orderlies
thronging round the engine with
an extraordinary collection of
utensils—dixies, tins, tin hats
(although the use of these for
cooking is prohibited) and tl\e
huge tins in which army biscuits
are packed. The engine-driver
is exhorted to produce hot
water, and obligingly floods the
injector. Water of different
degrees of temperature is pro-
duced at the overflow. Some-
times a blowbaek ,of steam
occurs, and from the rolling
billows of vapor voices with
much blanky draw the driver's
attention to the mishap. Fre-
quently the train jolts into slug-
gish motion unexpectedly, and
it is an exhilarating spectacle
to see (and hear) two diggers
trying to board a moving
truck with a biscuit-tin of hot tea. Should
they lose it, or spill an undue amount, the
ensuing remarks would singe the hair of the
cow on the rails two miles ahead.
* * * *
“G.R.H.”: Two Billjims, with seven
prisoners on fatigue-work, managed to get
boozed. They shook hands with the gang,
told them that their company wasn’t needed,
and refused to proceed further with the busi-
ness of reporting back to the detention-
barracks. Fritz was in terror lest he should
be forced to escape, and after a lot of argu-
ment it ended up with the seven Huns
escorting the two blithered Billjims back
and handing themselves and the escort over.
But this beats that. On May 2. 1918. the
—th Battalion was billeted in a big village.
The town was, for some reason or other, well
stocked with belltoppers and frock-coats.
Things got merry, uniforms were flung off
in the melee, and almost everybody got
hold of the fancy hats and “floggers.” Things
got hotter still, and in the morning uniforms
were missing or torn to ribbons when the
marching order came. Straight into action
went the battalion, and “over the top” raged
a mad, whirling mass of figures in full
garden-party dress!
* * * *
“Snell”: The “flying squad” put in an
appearance on our Melb. suburban line the
other morning, and the imperious official
nudged the plump gent, opposite me. The
plump gent, was absorbed in a half-cwt. book
called “The Psychology of the Hun,” and
did not notice. Again he was bumped up.
“Ticket, please.” The plump one draped his
spectacles across his dome and looked up.
“Eh?” “Ticket, please. Can’t stay here all
day. ’ “Bless my soul!” The plump one
carefully marked his book, closed it, took off
his glasses, put them in their case, pocketed
it, felt his left vest pocket, felt his right vest
pocket. “Bless my soul!” He ran wildly
through all his pockets. “Dear, dear me!”
He looked on the floor under the seat. Tried
the inside of his hat. “Well, I never.”
“Come, come,” snorted the official. “Have
you got a ticket or ain’t you?” The buxom
gent, searched his coat pockets. “Look at
that now?” The porter seized him. “Gotter
get off,” he said. “But I bought a ticket.”
“Explain that to the station-master.” “Don’t
you lose my place!” The fattish party
threatened the porter with his book. “Off
you get—train’s goin’.” “If—if you lose my
place I shall be very angry with you.”
“Off!” Everybody in the long carriage was
craning a neck over the partitions in appre-
ciation of the contest. The adipose citizen
clung to his cherished book, the porter clung
to the adipose citizen and hauled him on to
the platform. '“I was getting off here. I shall
report you. sir!” cried the meaty man push-
ing “The Psychology of the Hun” under the
porter’s nose. “You have made me lose my
place.” The whistle sounded and the train
moved out, two heads through every window,
yaps of derision assailing the portly cit’.
from every passing compartment. Pending
the approach of the station-master the stout-
ish gent, sat down, and opening “The Psy-
chology of the Hun” resumed his reading. I
observed that the book-mark was a first-class
return, St. Ivilda to Melbourne. The plump
gent, had lost his trip to the city, but he had
kept his place.

“Kell B.”: Talking about Queensland
judges. When I was reporting on a Cairns
paper years ago I got the shock of my life.
His Honor was late after the lunch adjourn-
ment, and the loungers had various emotions
when he arrived and passed to the judge’s
room with two real ladies (who had followed
him from Townsville), one on each arm,

laughing with hilarious abandon. Those
of us who didn’t know the Judge were
wondering if his joyous companions would
take a seat on the Bench, but I was clean
flabbergasted when, half an hour later, that
blithered Judge delivered the most lucid and
clever summing-up I have ever listened to.
He was generally a bit so-so, but I always
noticed that the more oiled he appeared to
be the better he seemed to sum-up a case or
argue with the sharks.

THE SPRINGING GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She’s here again, so sweet and slim
A tall flower on a slender stalk,
Her heart rose fresh, her feet so trim,
Creation’s stir is in her walk.
What memories are fondly blent
In her, vague thoughts we cannot name,
The Spring Girl, ever different,
Yet in a thousand years the same.
Ephemeral as dragon gay
That swims on iridescent wings,
She fades in Summer’s breath. No fay
Of all survives from yester Springs.
She was a drab, ungainly thing,
Till love and laughter stirred her soul,
Then, all her petals quivering,
She caught the sun, an aureole
To grace her head of gold, the white
And velvet of the lily’s dress,
The ruby’s fervor, and the slight,
Sweet daffodilly's daintiness.
The melody of thrush, the lift
And lilt of larks, the morning dew,
The evening’s stars, and every gift
Of swift, clear streams in her renew.
As flits me by this gracious elf,
I envy you, Old World, a king
Who every year renews himself,
And has a new girl every Spring.

“F.C.”: Whoever devised the plan of divid-
ing the States into districts and allotting
each its quota of the last War Loan uninten-
ionally provided a few financial mysteries.
Why, for instance, should Sale (Vic.) have
taken up more than five times its allotted
sum, while Warragul only furnished half as
much again as it was expected to, and
Bairnsdale but 25 per cent, over its quota?
Still, the country did well, most of it taking
up more loan than allotted, though rich Colae
and coaly Wonthaggi, among other places,
were under the mark. The metropolis
proved a disappointment, only Kew and
Camberwell handing out as much as they
were supposed to be capable of. Malvern,
Prahran, Caulfield and Brighton were all
‘“short”; so were Richmond, Collingwood
and South Melbourne, though Footscray
shone with comparative brilliance with sub-
scriptions tallying 60 per cent, of its quota.
“Bion”: Heaven knows that economy in
•the Defence Department is urgent, but why
should the female nursing-staff be the first to
leel the pinch? A few weeks ago the tele-
phone was x'emoved from the nurses’ quar-
ters at No. , A.G.H. A short while
after that a number of nurses quartered
there, who were called up for Base duty
prior to embarking for service overseas,
were given 24 hours’ notice to go on
indefinite leave without pay. The De-
fence Department supplied concession
tickets to their various homes. That
meant that some nurses were put to
unfair expense in getting home to say good-
bye and all that good-bye might mean.
These patriotic women might, at least, have
had free passes. Even the overseas nurses

who were temporarily attached to the staff
were ordered to take leave without pay in
rotation. Whilst on leave they must hold
themselves in readiness to be called back at
any time, thus rendering it impossible to
seek other employment. Is the Defence
Department stone-broke, or has it merely a
stone head?
“D.F.”: In the very early days of the
Jpeck bushranging seems to have been
reckoned better than a Government job.
A gang of 29 which was busy in
1814 plundering the houses of the set-
tlers and driving off their stock was led

It happened in an Albert Park. Vic.,

morning. Service was in full swing, and the

vulgar vices, including gambling, smoking and
the non-musical glasses, just nought, when
suddenly the door towards the street surged
open, and in, with the wind, sundry waste
paper, dry leaves and other debris
whirled the common man. He looked
like a workman rather the worse for over-
night wear and tear, and his obvious condi-
tion might reasonably have been accepted as
proof that our anti-liquor laws are system-
atically disregarded. The stranger stood for

will be no post-war trouble about
the employment of women in
Britain as war-substitutes because,
“although they have got through
the work, that they did it well or
efficiently without being trouble-
some is only a polite journalistic
fiction.” The R.S.S. League
claims that it takes a woman-
orderly “twice as long” to get
through her work, and that there-
fore no increase in efficiency has
been brought about by the recent
change. It has been explained
from Headquarters that “where re-
turned men have been replaced by
wardsmaids they have been found
other positions,” but the League
holds that there is no need to offer
such jobs, light hospital duties be-
ing particularly suitable work for
returned men trying to regain their
health. The military medico lias

willingly on at the same steady pace right

kink in it towards the end.

“Gouger”: In the desert fighting in Egypt
and on the fertile Palestine plains there is
not even a twig of firewood. The Light
Horse crossing the desert used to eagerly
rush the scanty desert shrubs in search of
precious dried roots with which to boil the
quart-pot, and the empty cases of bully-beef
were carried on horseback for davs. Those
lucky ones who possessed a few‘ sticks of
wood would carefully light up to boil the
billy and their less lucky comrades would
scramble to get their quarts as near the
blaze as possible. As soon as a quart was
on the simmer the tea would be thrown in
the pot hurriedly removed, and another
took its place nearer the scanty flames.

sermon ceased abruptly, Elder Spicer charged
down upon the rash intruder; but the latter
was already* shaking a familiar hand at the
outraged preacher and saying: “ ’Sail right,
old pot; keep goin’. I jes’ stepped in outer
the wind to get a light.” Then the pernicious
' sinner butted out again and went his wicked
way.

An expensive Senate commission has been

I have often seen as many as 40 quart-pots
in one line, their owners standing anxiously
around, alternately hoping:, praying, cursin'"
that their tin would come near the boil be-
fore the blessed fire burned down. When
we drove the Turks back to Bir el Abd we
cut the Turkish telegraph-line, and a man
from each section of two brigades, some
hundreds in all, broke out from the line
and rushed the posts. Innumerable instances
occurred for months where men risked rifie-
and shell-fire just for the sake of a few
sticks which showed somewhere near the
enemy’s lines. When we got into Pales-
tine we found that a lot of the Arabs’
hovels were held up by wooden rafters, and
as these fellows used to snipe our stretcher-
bearers we used to borrow their rafters with
pleasure. A good few men were stabbed
and found a lonely grave in Arab wells after
entering these places on their own. Still it
did not stop the rest of us.

“Bert It.” : In most of the big commercial
houses of Britain bitter complaints are made by
customers of mistakes and inattention on the
part of girls who are taking the places of the
men at he war. This is my own evidence.
Paid a visit to the Commonwealth Bank on
the first day of my leave in London. Pound
the counter besieged by a crowd of Billjims
seeking information of long-overdue remit-
tances from home. Pushed my way
through and arrived at the counter
just in time to hear a girl attendant
telling one of the diggers that there
was no word of his money yet. This
was his sixth inquiry, and he was sceptical.
Would she mind looking again. She did so
and repeated her former statement. He
turned to me in disgust and said : “I’ve used
my last penny coming for that money,
and they tell me it isn’t here. I’m sure it is;
but what’s a man to do? It’s impossible to
get any satisfaction from these Sallies.” I
was passing him a couple of shillings when
another girl who strolled leisurely up called
his name. “Here it is, you silly,” she
confided to her friend, and both laughed.
Hundreds of the troops were wasting precious
hours of leave every day trying to get satis-
faction from flappers who merely giggled
when they made a mistake. Prior to the
comb-out at the Base Post Office the men
redirected 12 to 14 hundred letters each per
shift. Girls were introduced, but as 300 to
400 letters was reckoned a good day’s work
by them the staff had to be trebled to cope
with the work. These girls are paid up to
£2 per week, and as the men doing three
times the work were drawing only 2s. per
day and 28s. per week subsistence, the cost
of administration of this department must
have increased out of sight.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
Federal Minister Jensen, being accused of
something or other in connection with some
business or other, has suspended himself,
pending investigation. That is to say, until
the cloud is lifted lie will maintain an aloof
attitude and not do the work he is presumably
paid for. If Jensen resigned it would be
easy to find a better man, and any wrong
done to him by the loss of his billet would
be more than counterbalanced by the repara-
tion made to somebody else who is tired of
waiting for the billet. As matters stand, a
Royal Commission, paid by the country, has
said things about Jensen, and now another
Royal Commission, paid by the country, is
to be appointed either to say them again, with
amplifications, or to make it a dead-heat
between the two commissions by saying
differently. It doesn’t seem much of a deal
for the country.
Treasurer Watt, in his Budget speech,
seemed sorry that the Federal Land Tax was
yearly bringing in less revenue. In T 4-15
the tax assessed was £2,347,000, while in
’l7-18 it was only £1,900,000. The decreas-
ing revenue shows that it is getting in some
solid disintegrating work, and the present
proposal to increase it by 20 per cent, will
give an additional punch which should prove
saddening to those hopeful souls in the Vic-
torian Parliament who lately abolished the
compulsory-residence provision known as
“Clause 69.”
The seventh Minister idea of the S.A.
Government has been dropped. No public
mention is made of any cause which definitely
killed it, but it is understood that an infor-
mal count showed the passing of any Bill to
enable it quite unlikely. The Repatriation
Minister is at present notoriously over-
worked, and Treasurer Butler has promised
in the Assembly that colleagues less heavily
called on will lend a hand.
When the recess arrives the Vic. Gov-
ernment will have a few positions, carrying
high emoluments, to give away. It is under-
stood that Hood and Hodges will retire from
the Supreme Court Bench at the end of next
vacation (February 1), and it will be neces-
sary to select new judges. If Mackey, the
Speaker, is given the chance to order a
scarlet a.nd ermine robe, pressure will be
brought to bear on Peacock to try for Assem-
bly chair. Peter Mcßride’s term as Agent-
General will be up in February, and as he
has already held the job for six years there
is doubt whether he will get an extension.
Mackinnon says he would not take the posi-
tion if it were offered to him. McWhae.
honorary Minister, erstwhile chairman of
the Stock Exchange, Melbourne, who is
wealthy, popular and possessed of adminis-
trative ability, may be offered the post.
Charlie Norman, chairman of the Railway
Commissioners, is due to retire in April. His
successor is likely to come from abroad, in
view of the Bowser-McPherson section of the
Cabinet’s weakness for the imported article.
(A wonder some of them didn’t want to
import soldiers to show Australians how to
fight!) The office of Crown Prosecutor,
worth £lOOO a year, has also to be filled, and
it is quite possible that Sainsbury will relin-
quish the Chief Commissionership of Police
soon.
One of the causes for high rents in N. S.
Wales is alleged to be the increased cost of
timber, and this is ascribed in part to the
fact that the State timber concern is always
willing to pay 6d. above the usual rate.
When the private buyer bids higher the State
concern rises another 6d., so the process goes
on. The State timber-yard charges itself a
very moderate rate of interest on its bor-
rowed capital, and yet. in its brief career, it
has made a loss of £60,800. So it is like a
lot more of the Holman Government’s para-
sitic enterprises. The Minister is good to
the fellow with timber to sell, and to the
man who carts it, and to the party in the
timber-yard, and earns a name for being a
fine, bluff, open-handed sort of chap, and
puts on some extra taxes to pay for it all.
Also the Government denounces high rents.
“Henry Horsecollar” on a law point:—
If President Wilson goes to Europe to attend the
Peace Congress, as suggested, he will require an
amendment of the Constitution, and it seems impos-
sible to manage it in the time. The Fathers of the
country, foreseeing that the Chief Magistrate might
become an expensive gadabout like Hughes and Beeby,
enacted that he must not quit the territory of the
Republic on any pretence. Mexico has the same
proviso, so the two Presidents have never met law-
fully, though they have looked at each other across
the river. The U.S. President may, of course, go
to Alaska by sea on a U.S. vessel, but if he went
there by land across Canada he would be null and
void. Taft went to Panama in a U.S. vessel—but
tin* U.S. thoughtfully annexed a large section of
Panama for him to put his feet on, and they were
no small feet either. If the great man was found on
a foreign vessel outside the U.S. water-frontage limit
the position would become strained. The only way
President Wilson could legally visit London or Paris
would be to go by his country’s ship and aeroplane
AN OVERSIGHT.
The APOSTLES OF FRIGHTFULNESS: “ Gott! If we had only foreseen this we might have
kept our hands cleaner .”
from it to his country's embassy, which ranks of
course as a bit of the land it belongs to, and stay
there. If his ship sank on the way and, say, a
Bolivian vessel offered to pick up the survivors, W.
Wilson would have to remain in the water till one
of his officers had got on deck and bought the vessel
or annexed the Bolivian Republic. Or if the cap-
tain had no power to sell, war might be declared
against Bolivia and the ship seized, and then the
head of Washington’s country could be legally
hauled on board. There would have to be a formal
apology of some sort and a treaty of peace, and
something in the way of an indemnity, but these
matters could be arranged. Bolivia isn’t an unrea-
sonable place like Germany. (N.B. —These statements
may be all wrong if the United States Constitution
has been altered without my knowledge or consent,
but I don’t think anything of the sort has happened.)
In October, Australia paid 137,321 war
pensions, 95,477 old-age pensions, 30,527 in-
valid pensions and (so it is printed) 42,332
baby bonuses —a total of 305,057 items. The
old-age pensions increased by 1258 and the
invalid pensions by 2807 as compared with
last year, so the community is ageing a little
and sickening a good deal. As for the baby
bonuses, the figures seem ridiculous. They
suggest 500,000 babies per annum, and the
average is about 130,000. As a general thing
the Commonwealth pays for more new infant
than it receives, but not to this extent.
There are, according to Premier Holman
“unchallengeable figures” to show that his
N. S. Wales meat monopoly scheme would
save £458,750 per annum to producers and
yield £108,750 profit, as well as supplying
cheaper meat. Also there is unchallengeable
bosh to prove that all the other enterprises
which Holman has helped to create during
his eight years of office were to pay like
Pactolus, and the loss on them for the year
to last June was £825,000. The year before
it was £1,037,000. Likewise there is indubi-
table nonsense to the effect that the North
Coast railway was to cost £2,500,000,
whereas it is going to cost £6,000,000. When
Holman goes into figures he is too often
wrong, and when he says his figures rest on
bedrock he is more wrong than usual.
“N.A.” : “Jack” Bailey, who was selected
by the executive of the A.L.P. to endeavor
to wear the political shoes of the late Gus
Miller, M.L.A. for Monaro (N.S.W.), is one
of the men who can claim to have upset the
even tenor of the ways of Premier Holman.
As one of the originators of the Industrial
Section (now Vigilance Council) of the
A.L.P., Bailey, at the Easter Labor Confer-
ence in 1916, moved a motion censuring the
Holman Administration for not attempting
to give effect to plank one of Labor’s fighting
platform. Despite Holman’s threat to re-
sign. the censure was substantially carried,
resulting in the one-day resignation farce.
IT. Lestrange, an ex-A.W.U. organiser, is
contesting the Monaro seat as an independent
Labor candidate. With Bailey he contested
the Federal electorate of Eden-Monaro as a
Labor candidate.
“Vic.” : I foresee that Australia is in danger
of being tipped up after the war by having
millions of tons of Hun goods dumped on
its eastern edge. The English Board of
Trade has obtained statistics about German
preparation in shipbuilding for peace. The
German Shipbuilding Subsidies Act passed
the Reichstag and became law in
November, 1917. How far its financial
provisions can be carried out we don’t
know, but there are promises of enormous sub-
sidies, for Germany was then buoyed up with
hopes of winning. More than one-half the Hun
merchant navy has been lost. Yet the Ship-
ping Subsidies Act promises to re-
place the losses, and gives details of how
each of the great companies is to be helped.
But even if that programme is busted now
Australia will be a world’s dump—even if
the avalanche comes in patriotic English
ships.
“Chev’s” suggestion:—
Will some honest legislator draft a Compulsory
Work Bill on similar lines as the U.S. law, origi-
nally introduced by W. S. John, a delegate to the
West Virginia Legislature in 1917 ? Maryland was the
second State to adopt the scheme that all able-
bodied citizens from 18 to 50 should engage in law-
ful, useful and recognised work, and the cry “Work
or Fight” raised by the War Department at once
gained a powerful ally in the strong arm of
the law. The common enemy is idleness, and
it matters not what the social or monetary 'status
of the idler —he has to get busy. Of course at its
inception the idea of compulsory work was laughed
at as freak legislation, but the scheme overcame
ridicule in no time. It is successful because the
force of public approval is with it. The reign of
the idler is over, and the beggar, the hobo and the
gilded sons of fashionable parents, whose most exact-
ing occupations used to be tangoing, bridging and
mixing whisky high-balls or freak cocktails, have
been yanked into the toil queue. The law in Mary-
land and West Virginia has already laid its heavy
hand on a long list of the idle rich who at first
contemptuously laughed at the scheme. The law
stipulates for a 36-hour work-week, and authority is
not enforced unless the suspect is proved idle. Bona-fide
students are exempt. In New York State the anti-
loafing law came into effect on July 1 last.
Several weeks before, the N.Y. police prepared a list
of 5000 of the semi- and petty-criminal classes—
sharpers, racecourse touts, gamblers, pickpockets,
fortune-tellers, billiard-room sharks, fake actors and
alleged theatrical agents, toughs, dope-fiends, degen-
erates, park loungers, gunmen and parasites and
crooks in general. A great number left the State
altogether, while a larger number found work of
some sort or other. It is a great social reform. I
confidently recommend it to Australia.
In South Australia the new minimum
wage of 10s. 6d. per day is calculated to add
£500,000 a year to the cost of running an
embarrassed State. Also, it means that loan
works will cost more, and, of course, the new
loans are already costing more. The old
loans, as the time for renewal comes round,
will also cost more. The last three troubles
are caused by the loan madness, and the first
one wouldn’t matter if it wasn’t that nearly
one-third of the revenue goes to pay interest
on the loan madness.
Delegates from municipal and district-coun-
cils met in Adelaide last week to clamor
against the proposed issue of life passes to
Ministers of the Federal and State Parlia-
ments, sanctioned by the Premiers’ Confer-
ence. The meeting was a wild one.
Speakers threw the whole dictionary at the
wasteful Premiers, who, while preaching
economy, want to increase expenditure by
“issuing life passes to political dead-heads.”
One boiling orator mentioned that he had to
perspire to secure paid-for accommodation
on inter-State lines on account of the large
number of spongers travelling with free
passes. Past and present Ministers are
already so numerous that, if this free-pass
fraud is practised (and made retrospective),
the paying public who own the lines will
presently have to ride on the cow-catcher.
Victoria’s plans for the construction of
terminal wheat silos, to take the place of its
present makeshift storages, are racing ahead
about as fast as a well-fed slug seeking cover
at daybreak. Tenders have been called for
and rejected, and contracts entered into for
vast quantities of cement have been side-
tracked, pending the calling of further ten-
ders later on. Locations have been consid-
ered, lots of expensive brains have done a
great deal of deliberating, and whole sheets
of postage-stamps have been used up in cor-
respondence. Yet the latest news is that
building won’t even begin for at least another
year. It seems strange that the Government
doesn’t put its own silo-experts on the job
at once, and do the thing itself without fur-
ther boggling, getting its labor from the
Repatriation Department. If a farmer wants
to build a silo, whether of brick, concrete or
timber and iron, the Government will send
an expert to show him how to do
it, and will build the thing for him if neces-
sary. But when it comes to building silos
for itself it makes a noose of red-tape and
sticks its long ears through it.
AFTER THE HOLIDAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The end of the war will involve a period of
reconstruction, which will make a call upon the
energies of every politician.” —Daily paper.
Now rise the politicians from their rest.
The war is over, there are things to do.
The holiday has filled their souls with zest
To grip their job again and see it through.
Fierce energy within their hearts is born.
A thousand wrongs are calling for redress.
They wake and stretch themselves with splendid scorn
Of forced inaction and long idleness.
Tlie seven Parliaments that rule the land
Prepare that weight of purpose to receive—
Each grips the wheel with shoulder and with hand
And sets his teeth to give a mighty heave.
Thus in a metaphor I state the case ;
But metaphors are merely smoke in straw.
Ia plainer fact, each spruiker smoothes his face,
Fills up his lungs and lubricates his jaw.

A WINNER.
ALF: '‘There's Bill knocked again. Some
blokes seem to git all the luck.”
“J.”: Witnessed recently some prepara-
tions for a “death-feast” in Torres Strait. Custom
is (though the missions are trying to knock it out)
for several feasts to be made—one when death
occurs, another some time later, and a third the
following year when the tombstone is erected. Gener-
ally, each family reserves special fruit, vegetables and
other food for these occasions. At the feast I
attended the kai-kai was laid out in a grove of
cocoanuts belonging to deceased. An imitation canoe
of bamboos, about 40ft. long, with outriggers, etc.,
complete, was constructed ; then the brothers, sisters!
uncles, forty-ninth cousins and other dubious relatives
humped along bunches of bananas, yams, cocoanuts,
etc., by the cwt. All the contributions were piled into
the canoe. Then builders got to work again and
manufactured the “crew,” out of bamboo and plaited
leaf, and these, in turn, were also filled with eat-
ables. The whole contraption was complete, from
the steersman with his paddle to a jugong-hunter
standing in the bows hurling his weapon at an
imaginary sea-cow made of yams. The native
doesn’t hurry over such jobs, of course, and this
particular crowd took about a fortnight to fix up the
show, though they put on more speed when it came
to getting outside the eatables. The design varies.
Sometimes, instead of a canoe, a whale, shark, dog
or- alligator is constructed, and there is generally
a fair amount of competition. The islanders show
great imitative powers. At oye big feast the food
was stacked up in a complete model of one of the
Government steamers—engine-room, saloon, bridge,
etc., complete, with officers, stewards, passengers and
even a bar!
* * * *
“Id{i D.”: Different aboriginal tribes had
different burial customs. Some buried their dead
in a sitting position, others made a kind of plat-
form on a tree and placed the body on board, without
cover of any kind. The “burial” in a tree is—or
rather was —fairly general along the Darling, past
the Queensland border and up the Maranoa, although
the tribes in those districts were distinct in dialect
and were frequently hostile. It is said that when the
blacks did not immediately find a tree with a hole
large enough to allow them to push in their departed
comrade, they made a kind of coffin with two sheets
of bark, Strapping the body in these with withes of
tough bark or animal sinew, and carried the cadaver
with them till a suitable hole was found. A few
years ago a stockman in the St. George (Q.) country
came upon the skeleton of a blackfellow in a hollow
tree. We reckoned it to be from 25 to 30 years old,
and it was in a remarkably good state of preserva-
tion. the jaw contained 36 teeth, verifying the
statement of Professor le Double (of Tours) that
“among the primitive races of Australia are to be
found natives with 36 teeth.” The molars were very
sound and strong, and mostly still firm in their
sockets, though some of the front ones fell out
after we had had the skull a few days.
* * # *
“ Jacko”: Native teeth are not what they
used to be, and Jimmy Paiwan may yet have to
depend upon a seven-and-sixpenny set of grinders.
r J hat will be a cold day for James. Have seen a
nigger use his teeth to haul off the skin of a cocoa-
nut and complete the operation without any trouble.
The islanders are careful about washing the teeth
and giving them a polish-up with pumice-stone; but
the introduction of various white-man things are
beginning to have the usual effect.
* * * *
Barcoo : This should settle all arguments
as to whether horses have a proper
development of the bump of locality.
In 1874 Donald Shaw and four others
started from Moura cattle-station on
th<? Dawson with 300-odd head of
prads, which they piloted due west on
to the then outback Barcoo River,
disposing of the mokes to newly-
settled station-owners and overlanders
as they penetrated the interior. The
last of the mob, 23 in number, were
sold to Portland Downs (W.Q.). In
those days there were, of course, no
roads; and, following permanent
watercourses, the distance from Moura
to Portland would be approximately
050 miles. The drovers having com-
pleted their job made back with their
riding and pack-horses to the home
station on the Dawson, taking a couple
of dai's’ jubilee at the five inter-
vening one-pub townships of those
days Blackail, Tambo, Springsure,
estwood and Banana. They were
10 days over the average travelling
time. Pussy-cat, a mare included in
the last delivery at Portland Downs,
not being a prohibitionist, arrived home at Moura
nearly a week sooner than the men.
* * *
“Myall”: Who or what does this belong
to ? On the bank of a lagoon in the St. George dis-
trict (Queensland) I was introduced to a footprint
in the soft mud of an animal, which had apparently
come out of the water. The imprint was Bin. in
length by sin. across, and appeared at first glance
like that of the paw of a huge dog. Closer examina-
tion showed that the centre was formed by a pad
(similar to the centre pad of a dog’s foot, but
several times larger), and from this centre pad, in
a half-circle, was the unmistakable imprint of six
toes, each having a claw. The imprint of the toes
very muc-li resembled those made by the toes of a
grown emu. Could not follow the track any dis-
tance, for the steep bank was covered with a rank
growth of grass and weeds, across which the national
debt of Australia might be rolled without leaving
the faintest trace. N.B.—The nearest pub was a
long day’s ride away, and I had not seen its cheery
sign for several weeks.
* * * *
“C.Mc.C.”: This is how to cultivate the
Sturt pea. Dig up a small plot of red clayey soil;
level and leave no lumps. Sprinkle seeds on the
prepared soil. Cut a piece of ordinary brown-paper
the size of the plot. Set it alight at one end and let
it burn to an ash. Remove ash and sprinkle a little
earth —enough to cover the seeds. Water lightly.
Young plants should begin to show from one week
to a month. Transplant when about an. inch hi®-h
Sow from March to August. Then you'll have "an

NAVAL DESPATCH.
FURIOUS ART VENDOR : “Devilessa! You have broka the Jellicoe. He have now onally
the one arma."
BLUEJACKET : “Oh, kuock his bloomin' eye out an sell him for Nelson."
“Sigzac”: Some of the diggers were
bivouacked on a bank of the Somme during recent
advances, and Fritz was doing his best to smash up
one of his own pontoon bridges that he had left in
a hurry. He dropped a number of big shells right in
the stream about 250 yards above our camp, and in
a few minutes dozens of fish, killed or stunned by
the concussion, were floating in our direction. The
boys whooped, peeled off and swain for their break-
fasts. They landed two fish-meals for the mob.
Incidentally, no digger would bother with rod, line
or net. A Mills grenade or German stick-bomb
thrown amongst a shoal will produce, more fish than
a Federal trawler could scoop up in an hour.
* * * *
“Geob”: Sharks are often seen at the
South Aus. bathing resorts, but there has been practi-
cully no instance where a bather
has been attacked; so some opti-
mists contend that our particular
sharks are too timid to touch
swimmers. Those that think
that way ought to clean forget it.
The following demons are always
in attendance: The dark-blue
(almost black), the dark brown
(with a swallow-shaped tail), the
light blue (known as “white
pointer”), ground or shovel-nose,
tiger or carpet shark, the brown
(called “cocktail” on account of
the top portion of the tail being
several times the length of the
lower half), the light brown (it’s
almost yellow), the snapper, the
hammerhead, sweet William and
dog shark. Any of these are
capable of lopping off a mouth-
ful. The first three sometimes
measure 25 to SO feet, but the
usual size ia 10 to 15 feet. They
mostly put in an appearance dur-
ing the summer months, looking
for stingrays. The shovel-nose
is the most dangerous variety
(six to ten feet) on account of
its numbers and ferocity. Th|re
are many instances of the brutes
attacking fishermen in dinghies.
When the Outer Harbor was being
constructed a small boy who was
fishing from the breakwater fell in and immediately
disappeared. It’s quite certain he didn’t go to
Europe that way.
* * * *
“Melos” : The Australian flower-pecker, or
mistletoe-swallow furnishes an example of the inter-
esting partnership between plants and birds.
Although partial to honey, fruits and insects, the
little swallow is an inveterate consumer of mistletoe-
seed. The mistletoe propagates only in the fissures of
bark and wood, and lodgment is effected literally
through the pecker. The missel-thrush or stormcock
performs the same humble service for the mistletoe
in England. The flower-pecker is found in India,
Malaysia and all Australia, except Tasmania, where
the mistletoe does not grow. The bird is a gay,
bright-eyed chap, glossy blue-black above, scarlet on
throat, breast and under base of tail, white with a
black central line on abdomen and dusky on flanks.
His wife dresses more soberly—-dingy above, buff on
throat and breast ; and pale scarlet under base of
tail. The nest is a beautiful little finely-felted struc-
ture, with dome, usually suspended in a clump of
mistletoe.
“Melaleuca” : There is one sure thing about
the “winders” of Tasmania. They are all of a kind
and poisonous ; so there is no need to be in doubt if
bitten. Only three species occur: the tiger (A 1 .
scutatus), the copper-headed or superb ( D. superbits)
and the whip ( D. coronoides). The first is perhaps
the commonest and certainly the most deadly. The
copper-headed is only about one-third as plentiful as
BREAKING POINT.
MRS. GOODE: “Henry, I realise that the
roads are in a shocking state, but I
really must ask you to relieve the ten-
sion of this blasphemous silence."
the tiger, while the whip-snake is likely to be met
with all over the country from seashore to mountain
summits. The bite of the whip-snake is not con-
sidered of much importance unless the receiver
thereof happens to be in poor health. Recently an
argument arose concerning' the biggest snake cap-
tured in the Speck. Expert investigation reduced
mythical records of 10ft. to 6ft. 2sin.

THE HERMITS OF THE BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On foothills far and lonely,
On plains that stretch outback,
On scrublands wide where only
The busbmen know the track,
Where never crowds come thronging,
Where never voices swell,
In hope, in grief, in longing
The grey bush hermits dwell.
Some are for ever dreaming
Of wealth that they will win;
Of golden treasure gleaming
Some unfound reef within ;
Of metalled “pockets” dropping
Down gullies dark and deep ;
Of wide, rich lodes outcropping
On ridges rough and steep.
And some who too much trusted
False eyes with love ashine,
And some because they lusted
For that gay mocker, wine,
Have sought the far-out places
Where bushland quiet reigns,
The wide and wondrous spaces
Of silent, starlit plains.
In grey huts old and lonely
Beyond the lands outback,
By hidden ways where only
The bushmen find the track,
Afar from city thronging,
From car and tram and bell,
Hoping, grieving, longing,'
The grey bush-hermits dwell.

“Devilfish” : Oyster-soup can be made out
of oysters, but it is just as good aud a lot cheaper
if it is made out of squids with an odd oyster to give
local color. A Corner Inlet (Vic.) fisherman used
to send a good many squids to Melbourne, where they
were allegedly sold for snapper bait; but he noticed
that there was a market even when the snapper were
not biting. On a trip to town he went to a
restaurant for a plate of oyster-soup, and then he
knew where some of the squids went. The ordinary
diner would not have suspected.

“D.F.”: The pioneer of the eucalyptus-oil
industry was John White, “Surgeon-general to the
Settlement,’’ who came to Sydney with the First
Fleet. The following passage occurs in his “Journal
of a Voyage to fiew South Wales,” published in
London in 1790 :—-
The name of peppermint-tree has been given to
this plant by Mr. White on account of the very great
resemblance between the essential oil drawn from its
leaves and that obtained from the peppermint
(Mentha piperita ) which grows in England. This oil
was found by Mr. White to be much more efficacious
in removing all cholicky complaints than that of the
English peppermint, which he attributes to its being
less pungent and more aromatic.
White not only used the oil in N. S. Wales, but sent
some to England. He got it from a tree which he
called Eucalyptus piperita, but which was after-
wards renamed E. capitellata.

“Hay”: “L.L.” asks (B. 10/10/T8) what
is the force, motion or attraction that checks, turns
or alters the course of a boomerang? “Attraction”
doesn’t come into the principle anywhere. Binghi
applies the necessary force to give the implement
rapid motion and the atmosphere acting on its
curves gives it the check that causes its subsequent
circumvolution, deflecting its course back to the
starting point. That is clearly what happens in
the case of the light weapon which, in the early
days, was much used as a sort "of plaything by the
young Centralian abos. These blacks generally
made the light boomerangs of mulga wood, hardened
by fire, but they used a kind of super-boomerang
for killing game. This was a heavy weapon which
when thrown described only a half-circle, and in the
hands of a practised hunter could be used with
deadly effect. The light ’rang was usually kept for
camp practice and amusement. Looking at the
shading on the ends of B. E. Minns’s drawing (B.
17/10/’18) it will be seen that a boomerang isn’t
flat, but tips up a couple of inches (more or less)
when laid on a level surface.

“Gouger” : We’ve got a brainy cat in onr
camp. The mice sink shafts about 6in. deep, then
tunnel for about Bin. When the cat reckons it’s
dinner-time she calls when Mrs. Mouse is at home,
plugs the exit with one hind leg, and then tears up
the tunnel with her front claws. It generally results
in a hot-mouse lunch; but yesterday puss struck a
shrewd mouse. Its tunnel was twice as long as
usual, so that stretch as she would puss could not
reach the menu. For a few minutes the cat’s whiskers
twitched in deep thought. Then with a feline grin
she withdrew her hind leg from the hole and inserted
her tail instead. She stretched out to her full length
and commenced to dig. A minute later that cat
was a ball of bristling hair, looping the loop in the
air with the teeth of a mangy little mouse sunk
deep in her tail. She hit the ground hard, bounced
twice and shot away in two different directions
simultaneously.

“J..11.C.”: How many bores in Australia
claim to be the first put down? Can anyone go
back evarlier than 1881? In that year, in the wool-
shed pvrddock of Strangways Springs station, far
north South Australia, an artesian bore was put down
by contnaetors F. R. Newberry and W. Page. Not
much mare than a trickle of water was obtained, but
it was enough to overflow the casing and keep a
waterhole in Anna Creek full all the year round. The
bore was “Alpha bore,” It has now fallen
into disuseb
“Caerloon”: “N.F.” (B. 17/10/T8) speaks
of a Moreban Bay figlet 25 feet up in the fork of
a gum senditng down a root to the ground. Nothing
new in this. There are hundreds of similar trees in
the Bananaland scrubs, and he can multiply his Syd-
ney suburban .tree’s 25 feet by four and five. Some
of our largest cedars were condemned to death by
birds, hundreds of years ago, carrying their fig-fruit
right to the top of some native giant. Time and
the octopus-roots carry out the death-sentence of
suffocation.
“Gleniris”: Frank Clarke, M.L.C., Vic.
Minister for Lands, takes a sorrowful view of the
rabbit problem nowadays, though not long ago he
decided to get busy and drag bunny out of his
burrow for good. Clarke reckons, after all, that
past Ministers should have avoided vague promises
and have stated plainly that Crown lands simply
can’t be cleared of the pest. Such a clearance,
Clarke now calculates, would cost in normal times
nearly half a million a year, to be permanent; and
his newest, forlornly-hopeful proposal is that settlers
on land adjoining Crown reserves should take up
blocks from the Government on a seven . years’
tenure, with the right to fence them and make
tanks. This suggestion lias been met with a certain
amount of subdued applause from the Mallee settlers,
who are the chief sufferers. Certainly nothing has
ever been quite so effective in the riddance of rab-
bits from the prolific North-West as the labors of a
willing farmer, armed with a mallee-roller, a set of
ploughs and a poison-cart.

“Keith Kennedy” ; The abo. also has his
stage-manager. The Ingham tribe had arranged a
eorroboree and had got a “ballet master”
from the tableland tribe to teach them some
new dances, lie tried to get me to shout for them,
so that they could put plenty of spirit into their
work, but I explained to him that professionals never
drink until after the show. They got through the
HIS AILMENT.
CAPTAIN BITTERS (to sentry he has caught dozing): “Does insomnia ever trouble you?"
PRIVATE SMART : “No, sir ; but I often get that full feeling after officers.”
first few dances all right, encouraged by his com-
mands, such as, “Go it!” “Stamp your feet! ” “There
are no nails in the ground!” After a while the
dancers’ energies began to flag, and when they
reached the curlew dance it was a dismal failure.
There was no vim in the wail of the curlew, so the
manager threw up his job and announced to the
audience: “No good; not enough l rum.”

“Lin”: After the 1914 drought rabbits in
the northern areas of S. Aus. were practically exter-
minated, but in a few years they have increased so
alarmingly that the pastoralists (it’s hard to
believe, but the statement comes from a station
manager) are anxious to see another drought. They
reckon they can keep their livestock going, and it
will enable them to get rid of the pest which is
eating the country bare. In the early part of August
a pair of rabbits reopened a burrow which had been
filled in for some years. Tracks indicated there were
only two using these quarters. The second week in
October the burrow was dug out, the old pair and
three litters of young, 27 in all, were secured, and
the doe was due to increase the family with another
litter. When the next generations arrive at this rate
of increase in 12 months —but I must go on with my
knitting.
“Bad Australian”; Thus Lyddeker, in his
treatise, "Marsupials” (Naturalists’ Library), refer-
ring to the native bear:—
Its favorite haunts are the hollow stems of trees,
from which it issues forth by night, and occasionally
also by day, in search of food. The_ flesh is con-
sidered a delicacy by the natives, and is regarded as
not unpalatable even by Europeans.
I have been intimately acquainted with the bear —
thousands of him —and I have never known him to
roost anywhere except in the big forks or coiled into
a ball around the topmost branch of his favorite
gum. Among the thousands of bears I have known
not one of them ever slept in a hollow tree or log.
I have frequently seen the silly coot roosting miser-
ably in the fork of a big hollow gum-tree through
days of cold sleety weather until he dropped off and
died of exposure. Although he had a good comfort-
able home at his elbow he hadn’t the savvy to step
in out of the wet. Also, I have seen binghy trying
to digest bear when absolutely up against it, but
neither he nor his missus nor his mangy mong
appeared to regard the dish as a delicacy.

“Belshazzar Binks”: Those wild beings at
Wollongong and elsewhere who filled the Abo. pages
of 20 years ago with fictional stories about the
vagaries of the padymelon and other melancholy
denizens of Outback have much to explain to Peter
or Beelzebub, as the case may be, for the virus of
their imagination still works up and down the con-
tinent. The other day, in answer to an inquiry, a
Sydney newspaper stated that “the centipede is
afraid of a tarantula, and when he lies down to sleep
he always takes the precaution to build a cactus
fence about him. A tarantula will never crawl over
cactus.” The newspaper’s problem-elucidator omitted
to add that the centipede first developed this defence
when he crossed the Darling River one drought year
in company with a kameraded tarantula. They
decided to be known as the prickly pair.

“T.D.C.”: Out on the Flinders (Q.) the
manager of Saxby Downs reports volcanic activity,
which goes to show again that there is little doubt
that Australia may yet see volcanic eruptions. On
the western side of the coastal range back of Mackay
there was for years a small hole in the ground giving
forth what appeared to be steam and smoke. The
blacks refused to go near the locality, believing it to
be haunted by the Prime Minister of Sheol. A stock-
man brought away some white mineral from the lip
of the diminutive crater, and his collection was
identified as salamoniac. About 20 years ago, close
to Port Newry, which is between Mackay and Bowen,
I found a small hill with a stream of lava down its
side. The disturbance had been so recent that i
very small trees were growing out of the surroundin'-
sand and other earth. e

“Euro” : One of the station blacks came un
to my hut nursing a baby that was certainly not
black. “Me bin gettim piccaninny, boss” he
proudly informed me. “That’s not your piccaninny
r- Wm bl " >» ffi
orright.” “But that piccaninny’s white; you can’t
gettim white piccaninny.” “oh, yes, oss
gettim white one orright; my lubra she bin eatem
plenty flour.”

Went west recently at the age* of
93, Mrs. M. A. Strickland, of Bundaburra station
Forbes (N.S.W.), who was one of the first Lachlan
pioneers. On one occasion she rendered bushranger
Ben Hall a kindness that was never forgotten In-
setting his broken leg and nursing him back to
health. In return, Hall granted immunity to Bunda-
burra, never once molesting any of its property
Once or twice he was obliged to appropriate a mount
of two from the Bundaburra stables, but he always
returned them. He was no lawyer.
“F.N.T.” : The Sydney Zoo authorities are
said to be awaiting with interest the arrival of an
albino kangaroo, found near Tibooburra (N.S.W.).
The animal is alleged to be pure white, with pink
eyes. This isn’t the only freak of the kind yet dis-
covered, for an advt. appeared the other day in a
Melbourne paper offering a white for sale
as “suitable for show purposes.”
* * * *
“Norseman”: Let me urge upon bread-
makers in the outback home that the wild hopbush
flower is much superior to the commercial article for
making either bread or beer. The former rises
better and the beer sinks quicker. The flowers are a
whiter color and do not get stale quickly. They
should be pressed in a box and allowed a week to
dry in a shady spot.
* * • *
“Wandi” : Though the cat-bird belongs to
the group of bower-builders, no one* has ever found
a bower belonging to it. Apparently it is an excep-
tion to the species and doesn’t bother with that
branch of architecture. Nevertheless it builds a
substantial and artistic nest, whereas the nests of
nearly all the others of the family are the flimsiest
of structures. When the wild cherry-trees along
the riversides are red with fruit you hear the cat-
bird crying like a cross baby, “Where are you,
Maria ?” Sometimes, in dull weather, he plaintively calls,
“Aren’t you coming out to-day, Maria?” He is a
greenish-colored bird, with light underparts thickly
speckled with grey; something resembling the satin-
bird, but bigger. A quaint fellow, whose odd voice
attracts notice as much as< does the laugh of Happy
Jack, the kookaburra. The spotted cat-bird of
Queensland is more boldly marked.

“1.D.”: At the beginning of winter I
noted the old saying that “many berries bring a
cold winter,” in reference to the exceptionally heavy
crop of berries on the sweet-briars in many parts
of the Monaro (N.S.W.) district. To date there
have been four snowfalls, the last, in the first
week of October, lying a foot deep in many places—
non in drifts, but on open, level ground; and said
by some people to have been the heaviest fall for 10
years. In the depth of winter the frosts were dreams
of crystal beauty, carpeting the ground and lying
even on the gum-trees till mid-day.

“Rita Sun’’: Anyone know of a tell-tale
device of any sort whereby gardeners may know that
J. )' rost has gone for the season ? Tomato-growers
in Northern Victoria are the sufferers to the extent
of thousands of pounds this season. Wary American
settlers in the irrigation districts save their tomato
plants by keeping them indoors till they reach
the bearing stage and are some feet high before
planting out. Some prophets say the black mul-
berry is an unfailing frost thermostatic. Their argu-
ment is that this tree, being deciduous, does not send
forth its new shoots till the enemy has vamoosed for
the season; but the proof is lacking.

1 arrum”: At the little-known Aber-
crombie Caves, reached per motor-’bus from New-
bridge (N.S.W.), I saw the much-talked-of petrified
wallaby and the piano. The petrified marsupial,
hanging by the neck in the petrified fork of a minia-
ture eucalyptus, looked more like a monkey than any
animal I can think of; but the piano, a stalagmite, is
perfect. The keys of the instrument are as white
as snow, and the pedals are there. The frame is
discolored, and, from a distance, with a light from
a cracky in the roof on it, resembles polished beef-
wood. These caves are not properly open yet; but,
when they are, they will put Jenolan in its place.

“Porick”: In India during 1917 close
upon 24,000 persons took the count from snakebite,
and 2000 from the attacks of wild animals. Tigers
got away with 1000 human scalps and the leopard
had the tally of 300. Elephants and hyenas shared
80, and wolves and bears 28. Rewards were handed
out for the death-certificates of 74,000 snakes, 6000
leopards, 2000 bears and 2000 wolves, and the
rewards for the tiger reached the remarkable figure
(for that beast) of 1200. You’re lucky in Australia
having only the Sosh tiger and the wild-cat.
EXPECTANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The air is like cold wine to-day
With the sunlight filtering through,
The tufted she-oak boughs a-sway
Green-laee the empyreal blue,
And down the slopes in serried line
Like burnished spears the grass-trees, shine.
The winding track is covered brown
With wattle-leaves, that fall and pile
To where the level ridge slips down
And dimples to a golden smile;
Where everlasting blossoms sow
A yellow floss; the grass a-blow.
A dim expectance thrills all things
As that befelt by sun-drenched flowers
Feeling the sweep of shadow wing 3
That tell the birth of sweet night hours.
I wonder, thrilled with this delight,
What news the mail will bring to-night.

1863. In 1864 the syndicate had enough of
newspaper owning, and after it had failed to
find a buyer at auction, in September, 1564,
the property was sold to C. H. (now Sir
Charles) Goode for £3510, and a new syndi-
cate of eight took it over. .1. H. Barrow, ex-
Congregational parson, of Clayton Chapel,
was the editor, and Burden was the secre-
tary. Mrs. Barrow and Mr. Burden died,
and Mr. Barrow married widow Burden. In
1866 the syndicate bought from Sinnett the
evening paper, the Telegraph, and the
two were combined as the Express
and Telegraph. Subsequently J. 11. Bar-
row and Thomas King bought out the
rest of the syndicate arid became sole owners.
Meantime, in February, 1869, the Adver-
tiser office had been moved to its present
position, and in 1864 John Langdon Bony-
thon, then 16, had joined the staff. Barrow
died in August, 1874, and Thomas King and
Mrs. Barrow became owners. In November,
1878, Mrs. Barrow retired, and Thomas King
and Frederic Britten Burden, son of Mrs.
Barrow, by her first husband, carried on the
firm of Barrow and King. In April, 1881,
Thomas King, Frederic Britten Burden and
John Langdon Bonython comprised the firm.
In July, 1884, King had dropped out, leaving
Burden and Bonython, and in December,
1894, Burden had retired, leaving Bonython
sole proprietor.
Charles Franklin, of the mechanical depart-
ment of Adelaide Register, has finished
the unusual term of 60 years in the office, and
is still going strong at his work. This is
because he started., early, at 13, in the old
days of candles, before kerosene came in, and
the paper was printed on two one-cylinder
machines. The proprietors were Anthony
Forster, Kyffin Thomas, Andrews, and
Joseph Fisher. The honors were “nearer 16
than eight. At one time I used to come on
Wednesday morning at 1.30, and leave on
Saturday at noon, in the meanwhile getting as
much sleep as I could in the office.” Hard
work agreed with Franklin. He claims, to
have missed only five weeks through illness
in the 60 years.
A book of some interest to Australian Inky
Wayfarers has just been published in London
under the title of “The Principles
tice of Newspaper Make-Ups.” Its author,
T. E. Naylor, is a leading member of the
staff’ of the Newspaper World and an
acknowledged expert in this particular line.
Burnham, proprietor of the Daily Tele-
graph, contributes an introduction in which
he finds fault with most of the books on jour-
nalism for concentrating so exclusively on the
writing side and neglecting the technical and
mechanical processes of production which are
of vital importance. “It makes all the differ-
ence in the world,” says Burnham, “whether
we put the truth in the proper setting or not,
whether the type be right or wrong. This
book will help by showing how it ought to be
done.” Journalists, he argued, were charged
with a strange lack of scientific analysis of
their own methods. “They give the news, but
the manner of its presentation to the public
depends rather on instinct and experience
than the reasoned adoption of definite
principles.”

paper owners the little Cooma (N.S.W.)

A Satchel of Books
Saints and Soldiers, by Harley Matthews (W. F.
Floesseil, Somerset House, Sydney). This is a book
of soldier sketches by a man who was there to see.
The yarns are lightly written and vigorous, depicting
the Australian fighting man in his casual mood. The
heroic side of the game is mostly left for another
day; but the pluck, carelessness and contempt for
discipline of certain groups of heroes are shown in
a strong light. Beer plays a prominent part, too ;
and the Anzac may be a hard-case, humorist, good fel-
lo\V, fool and wise man, but he is always a fine
fighter with a basic soul. The general damn-vour-
highness-for-interfering regard for the person
of rank goes side by side with vivid hints
of the slipshod lack of method which charac-
terised the early days on the Peninsula. Take
the book as a whole, the shorter yarns are the best;
and 'for construction, suggestion and feeling “The
Great Gamble” is perhaps the best sketch in the
collection. Harley Matthews has good color sense
and an eye for the crisp phrase. He can do better
than this when the emotions of the campaign come
into fuller perspective. , ,
Poems Written During the Great War, edited by
Bertram Lloyd. If the purpose of this book had been
to show the public how lacking in literary inspira-
tion the war has been it could hardly have achieved
greater success. The soldier-poets have their noses
in the cannon’s mouth, and all they see over the
rim of the muzzle is smoke and horror. There is
some strength, but little force; iron hardness, but
seldom flame. The opening sonnet, by A.E., is fine,
but he is looking from afar with Irish eyes: This
from the German of Heinrich llutter, translated by
Edwyn Bevan, is worth noting:—
“Who sees, year long, men slain and slay,
Nor feels his own life stricken cold ?
Once we were young, once tender-soul’d,
And now so hard, O God, and grey.
We would be young, be young once more:
These days, we would that they were done.”
That might be the real voice of Germany as distinct
from the bleat of Wilhelm the Licked.
The House Party Manual, by Noel Ross (Cassell
and Co., Ltd., London). Here is excellent fooling
combined with vast and subtle wisdom. The ancient
British institution of the House Party, as seen by the
' eyes of a Maorilander, ripples at every turn into
mirth, and the writer, now gone, gives a lot of sage
advice about a line of conduct to everybody, from
the vicar’s daughter to the pigs that call for admira-
tion. A bright little book which will hold its own
with the work of any of the current humorists.
Quite So Stories, by W. Hodgson Burnet. Here
you may learn, - after the manner of Kipling’s Just So
classics, how the “Az-quith got the Push,” of the
“Ko-lio Press that Kicked,” of the “Island that
wouldn’t Play,” and many other political events no
older than the war. Clever skits that give the Aus-
tralian reader a better idea of how the Englishman
looks at things than any study of his daily news-
papers.
Business, Robbery, etc.
A few published remarks re the Warrnam-
bool (Vic.) woollen mill are interesting in
connection with the War Profits Tax arrange-
ment. They are no different from lots of
other remarks, but they chanced to get into
print. The law provides that an industry
which is found making profits during the
war in excess of the previous average, or in
excess of 10 per cent., must pay the bulk of
them (up to 75 per cent.) to the Treasury.
The Warrnambool concern was small and
new, and it naturally hoped to enlarge, quite
apart from any war, just as a baby hopes to
grow up, even though battles aren’t raging.
But, being informed that because of the
war 75 per cent, of any profits made by the
natural growth of the concern would be con-
fiscated, while the loss, if any, would be its
own sole property, it hesitated. According
to the statute, no manufacturing business,
even if it had no connection with the war,
was allowed to grow, and no new one was
allowed to start except under enormous
penalties. Nobody knew how long after the
war the penalty on industries started during
the war, when they were so badly needed,
might last, so it was safer to do nothing till
peace time. It might be equally logical to
decree that if a boy came of working age dur-
ing the war, and thus became an industry,
he should pay 75 per cent, of bis wages into
the Treasury, but the Hughes Government
never had any logic. The importer, who never
starts a new industry, but sticks to his old
job of importing, wasn’t much affected, especi-
ally as he could expand without taking risks
in the way of buying new machinery, but the
manufacturer “got it in the neck.” The
Warrnambool concern had a chance to import
a lot of new machinery, even in war-time, but
it didn’t care to bury a heap of money in such
a gamble. If the Government, in its hunger
for revenue, keeps the War Profits Tax going
for a year or two after the peace, and doesn’t
alter the tariff, then the Australian manu-
facturer will be fighting with a 75 per cent,
duty in the importer’s favor, and this Govern-
ment seems capable of a lot of things. Now
the horizon is illumined with the additional
news that textile machinery will probably be
unprocurable for at least five years after the
end of the present armed peevishness. Practi-
cally every machine in Belgium, Poland and
Northern France must be replaced, for the
Hun has wiped tbbm out. A vast proportion
of the machinery in Britain, Italy, some neu-
tral countries, and, of course, some in Ger-
many and Austria, must be replaced, for
renewals had to be neglected during the past
four years, and the old apparatus has been
worked to death. So it is calculated that
orders already placed will keep the machinery-
makers busy for five years, and with so many
other repairs to do there isn’t much likeli-
hood of labor being available to extend the
machinery business for a while. This of
course is only one line; there are a great
many in which the suppiy of imported ap-
pliances will be even scarcer after the war,
when the devastated nations start their re-
building, than it has been lately. As for
any great movement in the making of
machinery here, the War Profits Tax took all
possible care of that. Freetrade may have
its points, though only the Lord knows what
they are. Still, the craving to squash Aus-
tralian industry in the importer’s interests
may be carried too far.

“B.” : Profiteering in imported wines and
spirits has been the means of discovering
Australian distilleries where supplies are
being manufactured in quality and quan-
tities till recently not heard of. Practically
all liquors imported before 1914 are made
locally, and may be bought, except liqueurs.
For many years Queensland has quietly but
with increasing activity been learning the
art of making a pot-still rum which might
equal Demerara or Lowndes. Brandy of a
high quality is made in the Hunter River
Valley district (N.S.W.) as well as in S.A.,
while Victoria boasts a dry-gin factory, which
has taken championship medals in Holland!
The same maker hopes yet to teach Scotland
the true taste of whisky. Some of the tipple
has already been sent there. Of Australian
wines, the plain' wholesome truth is that
probably nothing finer in the world is made
outside of France and Portugal.

“Plumber”: The solder I use is 50 per
cent, tin, which comes from Bischoff; the
other 50 is, of course, lead, which comes
from Broken Hill. Neither of these two
metals costs more than 10 per cent, to pro-
duce now more than it did in ’l3; yet solder
to-day costs 2s. lOd. per lb. wholesale as
against lOd. in ’l3. Now, I have an abiding
respect for the B. PI. Co., as the builders in
Australia of the foundation industry of all
others —iron and steel production—so I won’t
castigate the co.; but somewhere between the
mine and me someone is profiteering pretty
solidly. I wish the Price-Fixing Commis-
sioner would flash his electric-torch and see
who it is. ■
SHOPS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hate the gilded railings and the show
The big importer makes to sell his wares,
The avenues of lingerie that grow
By league-long aisles and miles of climbing stairs.
I lose myself in forests of new hats,
Round capr s of gloves and peaks of sunshades high ;
And in the desert of the Indian mats
I wander vaguely with an aching eye.
But there is gladness in the little shop—
A smiling face - behind a mound of cheese,
Six crowded shelves with pickle-jars on top,
And, down below, the lollies and the teas.
Soft drinks are there, and jugs and calico;
The bacon hangs upon the topmost beam;
And skirts and trousers droop in one lorig row
Beside the ice-chest where they keep the cream.
I think that Hell is full of bargain stores,
Great gilded places where the wares are cheap,
With idle women thronging at the doors
And breathless, buying crowds that never sleep.
Biit up in Heaven the quiet angels stop
To gossip ’twixt the clothes-pegs and the teas,
Where some white-aproned seraph keeps his shop
And smiles across a monumental cheese.

CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S MILION DOLLAR COMEDIES.
POVERTY
POINT
“The High Cost of Living” is the title of
the next comedy at Melb. Royal, which
recalls the late Jimmie Purvis to a defendant
in a Melbourne breach-of-promise case, who
bewailed that complainant had already
caused the loss of over a thousand pounds to
him: “Better to have loved and lost than
never to have loved at all!”
“Harrison O.”: Without being consumed
with admiration for the artistic qualities of
plays based upon a series of short stories,
it seems to me that “D.” is unnecessarily
sweeping when he asserts (B. 31/10/T8)
that “Sherlock Holmes” is the only offering
of the kind “that embeds the well-advertised
hero in a story that has even interest of its
own, apart altogether from dramatic quali-
ties.” In plot and dramatic qualities
“Raffles” was not notably inferior to “Sher-
lock Holmes,” but the older play scored
through having a more interesting hero and
a more efficient cast. As regards plot, con-
tinuity of interest and stage technique,
“Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford” was superior
to both. I am with “D.” when he instances
the feebleness of the Potash-Perlmutter con-
coctions, but I reserve my loudest complaint,
not for plays constructed round a series of
short yarns, but those based on a single
magazine story bumped, twisted and padded
to fill three or four acts. “Alias Jimmy
Valentine” (founded on O. Henry’s “A Re-
trieved Reformation”) was the most painful
example; but to my way of thinking,
attempts to adapt the mechanism of the
short story to the requirements of drama in
plays such as “Seven Keys to Baldpate” and
“De Luxe Annie” were not much more suc-
cessful. Even Kipling’s “The Man Who
Was” when made into a play missed fire.
Hugh Ward, being in Adelaide for the
first Australian production of a new play,
gave a supper on the stage of the Royal to
the whole company and a few prominent
citizens. Manager Herbert Myers mentioned
that they had made a record in attendance, in
spite of many playgoers being in Melbourne
at the Cup. Glover, Mayor of Adelaide,
“speaking as an Englishman,” said that the
Australian standard of production is equal
to that of London ; and Ward describing all
the players as his “colossal family” passed
the butter. When butter is called for Hugh
can always produce a pound or so from his
tail pocket.
“IV’: Re Byron’s “Manfred” (B.
17/10/T8). It was once rehearsed by Wil-
liam Hoskins in Dunedin, but never pro-
duced. William Rignold, here in 1890,
played the Chamois Hunter to Charles Dil-
lon s Manfred at the London Princess in
August, 1873. He once told me that it was
the rottenest show from an entertaining
point of view he was ever in. Albeit',
Dillon (here in 1862) was very fine
as Byron’s moody hero. Telbin’s scenery
of the Alns was the talk of London,
and the ballets were elaborate. But,
though the show danced hard it didn’t
run long. Phelps, on account of his popu-
larity, made it go at Drury Lane in 1563,
but Denvil, the original in 1834 at Convent
Garden, had not the same luck. John Cole-
man, in his memoirs, recalls how by the
irony of fate, Denvil was a ticket-taker at
Drury Lane during the Phelps run. In
Byron’s day “Manfred” had, of course, its
biographical bearings.
“Busk” : Dorothy Bruuton owes everything
to Mrs. Hugh Ward, the accomplished vocal-
ist who was known in the U.S. as Grace
Millar. At Dorothy’s early rehearsals stage
critics, especially female well-wishers (or
something) said her voice was too weak.
Mrs. Ward declared against them all. The
case was exactly the same with the first re-
hearsal of the brilliant Marie Wilton (Mrs.
Bancroft) in London. The stage-manager
wouldn’t have her on his mind —at least, he
wouldn’t until the leader of the orchestra
firmly interposed.
A returned Westralian Anzae lately
paraded his opinions on welcome-home music,
lie asked the authorities to cut out all dole-
ful stuff and give the warriors on furlough
something bright. If “Home, Sweet Home”
•must be played, he urged them to rag it.
“Tipperary,” he declared, is unlucky, as
whenever the Anzacs were given it before
bogging into the Hun, they got hard belted.
“Australia Will Be There” should also be
barred, as Australia is there and intends to
stay there till the finish. Also her army is
small compared with the armies of other
countries, and the sound of the tune makes
strangers think that Australia is “kidding”
herself that she is running the whole show.
“And,” concluded Billjim, “if any band plays
‘See the Conquering Hero Comes’ in my
hearing, I’ll ram the trombone down the con-
ductor’s gullet.”
“Buttinski”: “Norbell’s” story of the
waxworks “lady” and her clothes (B.
24/10/’IS) reminds me of Bill (“Pipeclay”)
Wallace and his combined vaudeville show
and waxworks at Bendigo. He once en-
gaged the late Horace Bent, Melbourne’s
one-time celebrated minstrel. On the re-
turn of Horace to “the Point,” his pals made
inquiries as to how he had been treated.
Bent painted a very gloomy picture. When
Bill next arrived in town to collect another
constellation of stars, he was put under the
third degree by Horace’s friends, one of whom
remarked, “Y’orter be ashamed of yerself,
Pipe, fer treatin’ old ’Grace like yer did.”
Pipeclay retorted, “Suffering Moses! I gave
him the time of his life. Why, ’struth, I
even gave him Ned Kelly’s suit!”
“Stargazer”: Esperanto is being boomed
just now as the coming common speech of
all creation, but it seems to me that in the
course of a generation the living pictures
will have made it a wasteful and ridiculous
excess. The film drama is rapidly establish-

ging a tongue.
Already there is a
suggestive move-
ment of the fingers
implying money or
“pay up” that is
recognised every-
where. There is
another movement
of the hands that
means admiration
for a beautiful
face, which 99
people out of every
100 understand. If
would be possible
to instance a dozen
symbols that the
pictures have made
familiar, and which
are coming into
common use, and all
t h e indications
strengthen my be-
lie? that the coming man when he arrives will
talk with his hands and feet, reserving his
oral apparatus largely for drinking purposes.
“Mime”: The original hall stage-setting
in “Dorothy” has been taken as quarters by
one of the innumerable new nublic depart-
ments that are gradualy filling up odd cor-
ners of London. In other words, the Surrey
Public House Trust has taken over the
Angel Hotel in High-street, Guildford, the
staircase and gallery of which served as the
model for the scene in the old-time opera.
Anybody who steals about Liberty Hall sing-
ing “Queen of My Heart” in the future will
probably be strangled with red tape.
“G.” : Fifty-eight years ago a Frenchman
found that he c-ould, with the aid of electricity,
photograph moving objects, and from then
on to 1891, when Edison took out patents
for his kinetoscope, many were experiment-
ing. Edison was the first to show the pos-
sibilities of cinematography. However, in
1893, the Lumiene process really commenced
the moving-picture industry. M. Gaumont
was one of the first French producers, lie

purchased Georges
Demeny’s interest,
a French professor
associated with
many of the early
discoveries. Lumiene
sold his patents to
M. Charles Pathe,
who recognised the
commercial advan-
tages to the indus-
try. Commencing
with 17 workmen
he has to-day 4000
employed in his
facto r i e s. The
Americans did not
get busy until ten
years ago, but now
pictures is one of
the most import-
ant industries of
that country. The
salaries paid to
some stars indi-
cate the money
that is invested in
it there. Australia
is waking to the
fact that it can
turn out films
equal to the im-
ported, and if local
producers are not
squeezed out by
greedy syndicates
that live by the
foreign film there’s a big and busy future
for them.
Amendments to the Entertainments Tax
Act have become law and the tax of Id. on
all payments for admission not exceeding Is.
operated from Tuesday, the 12th instant.
The Taxation Department is obtaining
a supply of 3d. and 6d. stamped tickets
similar to higher-priced checks already in
use, but as some weeks will elapse before
new tickets can be distributed throughout the
Commonwealth, the tax on tickets of 6d. or
under must in the meantime be paid (except
in cases where proprietors are working under
bond) by affixing postage-stamps to ordinary
admission tickets. Proprietors of entertain-
ments must arrange for adequate supplies
of postage-stamps to affix to 3d. and
<>d. tickets. No tax is payable on 3d.
tickets for Saturday-afternoon matinees
issued to children who are apparently under
12 years of age. but the proprietors must
use a special roll of tickets for these admis-
sions. . The rates of tax applicable to prices
exceeding Is. have not been altered.
“Dr. Nil” : I think it is time that certain
concert items were done in the dark, or off
stage or behind a screen. No matter how
fine a performance is given by, say, a pretty
flapper violinist, it is almost impossible to
avoid giving her more than her due. When
one is asked to compare the work of a mere
male, especially a plain one, with that of a
sylph with downcast eyes, a pathetic
mouth, fascinating arms and hair sweeping
back from an Attic forehead, whose every
movement and mannerism is of a distracting'
attraction, how can a poor, trousered devil in
the audience find a true verdict between the
two from a purely musical point of view?

31/10/T8) records the death of Henry
Hamilton, Drury Lane dramatist. It sets
me wondering. In 1889, when I was pill-
rolling in Hiliston (N.S.W.), a Henry Ham-
ilton and his wife .and co. came there with a
“fit-up” and did “In the Ranks.” I went to
the show, which was far from bad in the
circs., and invited If.II. to supper at my
abode (Finche’s Hotel) afterwards. We sat
yarning far into the night, comparing remi-
niscences theatrical. He told me that he
had always bqen a failure as an actor,
although lie had for a long time played
minors with Henry Irving. He was evi-
dently a man of parts, and I wonder if the
Henry Hamilton of B. 31/10/’lB and mine
are one and the same.
“JAY.” : It is quite new to hear of com-
poser Ivan Caryll being described as a Bel-
gian. In England the story was always
current that “Ivan Caryll” was but an
artistic camouflage for a stodgy all-British
family name. Incidentally. Carvll’s name
in conjunction with that of the "late Paul
Rubens (quite the nicest man who ever had
to do with stage), brought about an imi-
tation of J. Iv. Stephen’s quip—-“When the
Rudyards cease from kipling, and the Hag-
gards ride no more.” The parody ran.
"\\ hen the Ivans cease from carylling and
the Rubens paul no more.”
“D.”: The gentle old actor told his Cup
story: “It was in 181)5. On the 31st day of
October a poor boy might have been seen
leaving Spencer-street station, carrying in
his hand a quaint and dingy carpet-bag, the
aggressive drunkard’s-liver pattern, which
was only slightly tempered by time and wear
and tear. The youth looked quite an aggres-
sive sample of the bush-bred neophyte down
to break the ring with the £3 Bs. 4c saved
out of his share of the egg-money on the old
farm at Buinboozle. There was hay in his
hair, there was desiccated milk on his boots,
bis whiskers were young and foolish, and his
hat was the hat of a born idiot. As he
moved towards Bourke-street, gazing upon
the wonders about him, a nice, kind, well-
dressed young fellow approached, and claimed
to be a bosom friend of his Uncle Joseph—
or was it Henry V Hearing David had money
the kind young fellow agreed to show him
round and introduce him to good society. He
found two other nice young fellows in a hotel
parlor, and they gave David to drink and to
eat. David ate and drank with marked
ability. They took the poor, bush-bred simple-
ton to other places, and gave him more
drink, and then invited him to participate
in a game with a peculiar match-box; and
while they were playing the police broke in
and arrested the nice young fellow and his
friends. I was content, for I had had good
food and comforting liquors when I most
needed them, our disastrous Western Dis-
trict season having culminated in a fire at
the hotel at which we were staying, while
we were playing my own ‘Bride of the
Bush,’ and I had perforce to escape to Mel-
bourne with the remnants of my fixtures in
that property-bag in my make-up as Dave,
the loutish rouseabout, by the expenditure of
my last i>enny. I told the nice young chap
before the trial that I had mistaken him for
a Friendly Society for the Reception and
Sustentation of Destitute Actors. My word,
he did seem pleased.”

He in newspapers placed to say

Poor Morey could not make his rents.
Still fired with splendid hope, the pro.

Perplexed he was to raise the dough
To pay the band. For gents to blow
The bugle and such things are men
Who look for wages now and then.
Now “Scores of Thousands Turned Away !”
The advt. read. Said I: “Come down,

To emptiness.” He answered: “Stay!
’Tis true. This company’s renown

The End of the War Now Means
*
Increased Competition in All Lines
The Armistice dictated to Germany by
the victorious Allies less than a week ago
virtually means the end of the war and the
long-sought world’s peace.
The liberation of thousands of plants from
the making of munition and war equipment
will immediately intensify competition in all
lines of manufactured goods.
And increased competition means the
adoption by all progressive manufacturers
of everything that will tend to increase
production, and so lessen overhead
charges.
One prolific source of power leakage, and
thereby waste of money through limitation
of output in many manufactures, is a more
or less inefficient belt service.
Investigation has amply proved 'that thou-
sands of pounds are wasted every month
throughout Australia by lack of knowledge
as to what constitutes a really efficient belt.
Scores of sales of Goodyear Belting are
being made in these days of capacity
production, and still more will be made in
the future, solely because of the continuous
and efficient service records which Good-
year Belts are everywhere making.
To any mill, factory, or workshop needing
advice on the belting requirements of their
particular plant we will send an expert, who
will tell them how power can be conserved
and bigger output obtained.
Thus, in addition to Goodyear efficiency, you
will, free of cost, obtain Goodyear service also.

“Geedee”: “F.C.” (B. 17/10/’18) “has no
recollection of any Labor leaders making a
fuss about the hours of nurses in hospitals
or those of mental hospital attendants.” YV ell,
the nurses and attendants at this institution
(Dunwich Benevolent Asylum), also those at
the various mental hospitals in Queensland,
work a 48-hour week, and have done so since
January last.
“M.H.”: Here’s an instance of the sur-
prising way in which really good enterprises
in the army run to seed. I know intimately
a company of the Australian Salvage Corps,
having been located with it for some weeks.
Tne corps serves a very useful purpose, its
salvage having run into millions of pounds,
and it is a unit into which men who are
war-worn and unfitted for the line can be
retired for a time. The strength of the divi-
sional company was 70 men, but actually
never more than 40 went out in the working
parties, for the soft gobs that had grown up
in the unit were amazing. The Acting O.C. was
an officer who had never seen the line since
Gallipoli, although a thoroughly hale man,
and he very seldom visited the working parties.
Yet he considered it necessary to have (1) a
horse, (2) a groom to look after it, (3) a
batman, (4) a funner. There was another
runner (cyclist) attached to orderly-room,
and the unit had to possess, besides, an
orderly-room N.C.0., a groom for the salvage
waggon, a driver therefor, two cooks, a sani-
tary man and occasionally others. The cooks
were, of course, really necessary; but most of
the other jobs were false presences. And a
full half of the crowd were strong, physically
fit men who had been in France some time
but had never seen the line.
“A Chronic Shifter” writes : —-
Under the new British electoral law —the one
which gives votes to women who own up to 30
years—the person who lives as a short-distance tenant
in unfurnished rooms has a vote if otherwise eligible,
but the one in furnished rooms hasn’t. So the old
property qualification idea isn’t dead. The man
of the first category (unless he simply dosses on the
floor) has his own table, bed and two chairs, which
represent a stake in the country and give him an
appearance of permanency, while the man who hires
his few sticks is apt to be a bird of passage. In
Scotland the humble unfurnished tenant usually
includes a grate among his hostages to fortune. The
landlord doesn’t supply that article, hoping that the
tenant will be ballasted and hindered by it in his
moonlight flitting. On the other hand, the bed, or
the skeleton of it, is the landlord’s fixture and looks
like a stuffy cupboard. In the big cheap Scotch
tenement house removals are constant, but the ortho-
dox furniture-van isn’t seen in front of the common
entrance from one year’s end to another. The loss
of one month’s rent out of 12 is regarded as among
the drawbacks of the game, or there may be three
tenants in a year, each leaving a month’s bill.
Vanishing is a fine art, and the cheap tenant is like
a vapor. A Sydney cheap ; house landlord, giving
evidence before the Housing Commission, complained
of this trouble, but Australia doesn’t even begin to
understand what it means. In Glasgow even the
occupiers of fairly well-stocked but unpayable shops
disappear in the dark of the moon, leaving not a scrap
behind. It is different in Prussia, where the depart-
ing tenant has to give notice to the police with
full particulars, and the arriving tenant (the same
person, only in another street), in addition to giving
the police full details of the parentage and religion
of his wife’s grandmother, has to state where he
came from. And if the information, which is
immediately audited, proves incorrect it would be
better that the Tower of Siloam fell on that shifty
inhabitant right off. Presumably, however, the clause
which makes the act of dwelling amid hired furni-
ture a disqualification for the vote isn’t intended for
the tenement-house bird of passage. It would be as
sensible to provide that he couldn’t vote if he habitu-
ally cruised in a hired yacht.
“ Jacko” : It has taken a special commis-
sion months to discover an expensive ab-
surdity in Defence administration that would
have been spotted by the average keen mind
at once. For the past three years the annual
training of the citizen force units has been
confined to annual camps of several weeks’
duration, with nothing else on the programme
during the year. Nevertheless the old pre-
war system of rendering weekly, monthly or
quarterly returns on expensive paper, and
necessarily all nil, for the returns cover mat-
ters that could happen only if the former
system of day and half-day parades sprinkled
throughout the 12 months was in vogue, has
been insisted on. In the case of any one
unit the paper bill has been appreciable; but
when the thousands of units throughout the
Commonwealth are reckoned on, the waste of
paper becomes shameful.
N. S. Wales Full Court’s recent decision
that a boarder not paying for his meals and
accommodation is liable to be dealt w T ith as a
vagrant settles a point which has been in
doubt since Wade’s Amending Liquor Act
was passed in 1905. Several magistrates
had held that the extension of the
vagrancy provision to persons being
supplied with meals and accommodation was
designed to hit the casual guest only and
not the boarder or lodger. Even District Court
Judges have held diverse opinions. The late
Judge Gibson, in an appeal case at Gunne-
dah Sessions in 1909. held as the Full Court
did the other day ; but other District Court
Judges have held differently in more recent
years. The fact that the publican is a per-
son who expects no favors and takes his
gruel uncomplainingly is probably responsi-
ble for the point not having been cleared up
years ago.
Many yarns have been published about the
German’s comfortable trenches and his
shoddy equipment. Something from an Aus-
tralian officer, writing of what he noticed
while clearing up the Somme country in
August: —•
It is reallv remarkable how filthy Fritz had
allowed his living positions to get. The trenches, dug-
outs and posts from which he is bolting hereabouts
stink with the peculiar aroma imparted by animals
to a zoo. Bits of food, old tins and muck of every
kind are littered all over the place. Another strange
thing to notice is the excellent quality of our friend’s
field equipment. The leather goods, telephone instru-
ments, medical gear, field-glasses and all that sort of
thing ’he left behind are first-class. He certainly does
not seem to be short of leather. We have had some
big hauls of books. The volumes quite recently pub-
lished are very well bound and printed on paper of
excellent quality. His maps are particularly good,
but in that respect I think we now more than equal
him.
Now. will the famous author who described
the Hun as “the dirty dog of Europe” arise
and apologise to the dog?

Apparently the council of the Agricultural
Society of Victoria is more interested in its
Show Day luncheon, with the accompanying
tail-spreading and making of self-congratula-
tory speeches, than in trying to push things
ahead on behalf of the rural-producer. Secre-
tary Henry Schwieger, evidently speaking
from a full-up heart, intimated as much in
his newly-published report of the recent
Show Week proceedings and the busy times
which went before. “With one exception,”
groaned Henry in his statement, “not a single
steward took the smallest part in the prepa-
ratory work.” They just left it to Schwieger,
who as a result worked himself to a stand-
still. As the opening-day approached the
work began to tell terribly, and he had to
be “brought round” from a succession of
fainting attacks, induced by worry, overwork
and lack of sleep. Poor treatment, of course,
but the council simply applied to its secre-
tary the ancient cow-cockying principle of all
work and no play for the hired hand—only
in Schwieger’s case the council seems to have
gone the limit.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: “Simon” (B.
31/10/T8) is a bit out in his yarn apropos
Pasha Barry and W. C. Wall. The latter
was peddling sewing-machines, and doing
well at it, when first called upon to stand for
Mudgee in June, 1886. He was returned at
a by-election on the resignation of John
Robertson; at the general election eight
months afterwards he was second on the poll,
being sandwiched by A. G. Taylor and Reggy
Black, 15 votes only dividing second and
third. Wall sat for Mudgee until 1894, when
the constituency was split up and he was
returned for Rylstone, beating six others and
with a clear majority against the lot. At the
next “general” he was beaten by J. C. L.
Fitzpatrick, the present Treasurer of the
State, by six votes. Fitzpatrick was un-
seated on petition, but recovered the seat by
an increasd majority. That was Wall’s last
seat.
From London:—
When did Australian official representation in
London actually begin? In an article descriptive of
Australia House J. F. Hogan recalls that away back
in the ’forties Francis Scott, M.P. for Berwick, was
retained by the N. S. Wales Government at a salary
of £6OO a year to promote and represent Aus-
tralian interests in Great Britain in general and
in the House of Commons in particular. Scott’s
great opportunity came when the Colonial Office vote
was debated, lie used to let himself go on all the
grievances of Australia and the administrative blun-
ders of Downing Street, concerning which he had
been fully primed with authoritative information
from Sydney. His speeches were always reported
verbatim in the Svdnev Morning Herald (doubtless
set up from manuscript supplied by himself), and
they sometimes filled whole pages of the paper.
Scott was nor, technically or officially the first Aus-
tralian Agent-General in London, but practically and
to all intents and purposes he may be legitimately
regarded as the pioneer of the line—the germ of the
gorgeous million-pawned Australia House in the Strand
where High-Commissioner Andy Fisher sits in regal
magnificence without bowyangs on.
■After many delays, shipbuilding yards are
being commenced at Port Adelaide. Four
steel cargo steamers of 5500 tons each are
to be constructed for the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment. Poole and Steel are the contrac-
tors, and the State Government are advanc-
ing £OO,OOO to them free of interest to erect
suitable yards. They are given 21 months
to complete the first vessel. When the
agreement was being confirmed in S. Aus.
Assembly the Opposition was under the mis-
taken impression that the right was reserved
by the State Government to resume the yards
at the expiration of six years, or any subse-
quent six years. However, there is a clause
that the works can be resumed, but only by
resolution passed in both Houses of Parlia-
ment. The Peake Government is greatly
opposed to the State doing anything that
might possibly interfere with P.E., and if
a future commonsense Government wants to
take over the yards to start a State ship-
building industry, it will find itself up
against the Legislative Council, which can
put the _ acid on such a proposal before it
materialises. Preparation of the yards and
preliminary work will occupy about eight
months. Poole says that Australia will not
be able to compete with overseas ship-build-
ing without Protection. He does not fear
American and British, but there will be
trouble with Japanese and Chinese competi-
tion after the war. Labor charges there
are about one-eighth of the Australian.
Last year Poole visited China and Japan
and saw many yards building vessels of all
sizes up to battleships larger than the
H.M.A.S. Australia.
“H.lJ.’s” protest:—-
I have certainly read that the importation of
jewellery was prohibited in this war-time, it being
classed as a luxury. All the same, the imports for
the first two months of this financial year (July-
August) are reported as £271,435, or at the rate of
over £1,600,000 a year. This is far more than the
figures in the last years of peace. The business has
been going strong all the time, while some fools have
been preaching “breadless days” in the name of self-
denial, after the fashion of countries where grain is
scarce—breadless days in a country with millions of
tons of wheat that it can’t get rid of! The importer
seems to be on a heavenly wicket just now. For
July and August imports were £14,882,431, or at
the rate of about £90,000,000 a year. This was
£7,000,000 more than the corresponding two months’
record last year. The exports, which are supposed to
pay for the imports and for the interest on all
our foreign debts, public and private, and for the
upkeep of our seven ambassadors and sundries, and
for the maintenance of our army in Europe,
amounted to £12,953,562, or £1,928,869 less than
the amount required to pay for the imports alone.
Clothes accounted for £5,777,992 of imports in two
months. In this clothes-drunk country it is by far
the biggest item. Alcohol ( £294,775) came tenth
on the list, which divides the imports under 16
headings. It just beat jewellery by a short head,
and was miles behind soft drinks (£628,180). An
astounding fact is that £140,404, or at the rate of
£840,000 a year, went in payment for two months’
supply of imported leather, yet there is £1,000,000
worth of Australian leather that the country can’t
get rid of for want of ships to take it away. I
suppose a section of the clothes-drunk community is
too dignified to use Australian leather. When a
country is paying £7,400,000 a month to deprive
itself of the most profitable kind of employment
there isn’t so very much left to pay a living* wage
with, especially when the fellow with the £7,400,000
bill won’t take our paper money in settlement.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
“Hostilities cease” was the match that
sent Sydney off its head on Friday. Before
the town openly flung off its stolid garb of
work, girls on carts, lorries and packed
taxis were the forerunners of the noise to
come. Many of them had rushed hatless
into the street and made a shouting flag-
flapping throng. Indecision swayed the shop-
hands. Some walked out and took a holiday.
Others, as seen by the early passer-by,
danced to a hurriedly-improvised ragtime,
and after bubbling over returned to the
business of selling crockery, socks or fish-
hooks at exorbitant prices.
David Jones’s took time by the ear, shut
up shop and ran up a wooden wall outside
the windows. On this corner surged
the dense crowd that later in the day tried
to worm its way through Martin-place to
the “Destroyer” in Moore-street. The most
annoyed inhabitants of the Block were, possi-
bly, the Post Office pigeons. These refugees
flew from window-ledge to telephone post,
then back again, to tremble on the dusty
sills of offices skied in tall adjacent build-
ings. One fluttered on to the head of an
excited elderly patriot, who, hatless, had
wrapped his cranium in the Union Jack.
The opening of the National Economy
Exhibition in the Town Ilall brought only
a fair attendance. Yet the exhibition, grant-
ing many of the stalls may be classed as
purely trade advts., was worth while
attention. The idea behind the patriotic
women’s notion of economy is not the spuri-
ous thrift which will try (perhaps) after
the war has simmered into a memory to
buy cheap German goods. The local product
has come to prove itself in the exhibi-
tion. In the making of sweets and
confectionery, artificial flower-making, and
other lines in which this country used
to modestly efface its efforts, the war
has been a sharp spur. The wife of
Cullen, C.J., who “opened” the display, was
metaphorically supported by Senator Prat-
ten. Just opposite was a thrilling exhibit
of feminine lingerie wear. But the Senator
cautiously looked towards the floor and
talked unmoved of National debts and the
taxation that next year will make our life
a penance for our political sins.
The Repatriation Department’s demonstra-
tion at the National Economy Exhibition
gave a fair idea of the training returned dis-
abled soldiers get at machining, cabinet-
making, boot-repairing, pottery, etc. Beside
a notice, “State Trawling Industry,” girls
were vigorously making up Manila-twine
into nets. The process was a good deal like
super-tatting. The Murrumbidgee irrigation
scheme was represented by a good exhibit of
bacon, fruit and cereals. Wyong, which was
going to send a forestry exhibit, was too busy
calling up all hands to beat out bushfires to
fulfil its promise. Spinning and hand-weav-
ing were amongst the local industries that
may claim to be war babies in Sydney. The
hon. sec. of the show was Ruth Beale; Grace
Burrows was exhibition manager; and Mrs.
Hugh Dixson was president of the committee.
About 50 years ago a lad of 15, who landed
in Maoriland and could speak very little Eng-
lish, was asked by a genial inhabitant where
he came from. “Hungary,” said the boy. He
was promptly taken in hand, the local citizen
repeating “Hungry” in sympathetic tones.
He filled that boy to the brim with good
things. “And that.” says Mensdorffer, who
with his partner Fraser of Bendigo (Vic.)
has been perfecting discoveries of the dyes
that can be made from the eucalyptus, “was
my first impression of Australasia—kindness
and much hospitality. And it has never
changed.” When wanderers at the recent ex-
hibition pulled up to inspect glass-cases full
of samples of goods dyed in Australia, the
old gentleman told them more about the
virtues of the eucalypt tribe than they’d
ever known before.
Last Saturday there was a dress rehearsal
of the V.A.D. outdoor drill for the gala
march of the white aprons in Centennial
Park on November 16. Lady Davidson will
review the pinnies.
Off to U.S.A. in January, soprano Nellie
Leach, the Sydney girl who warbled for a
time in the Tivoli circuit. With her goes
Celia Ghiloni, of the beaming smile so well
known in musical comedy. New York is
their Mecca.
After a long argument with the A.I.F.
medical heads about an alleged- defective
eyesight, engineer P. Lethbridge King went
off on his own by the Niagara. He's bound
for London and a commission in the Royal
Engineers. But a shortage of war is likely
to be the Sydney man’s trouble before he’s
half-way to Vancouver.
Bishops have been on the home trail for
the past week, after their corroboree in
Sydney. His sub-gaiters, the Anglican Dean
of Adelaide, and the long, sinewy figure of
Archbishop Riley, of Perth, went off early
in the exodus. Tassy’s Anglican prelate
got away before the shipping began to be
stuck up in the quarantine area. __ An in-
coming cleric, Bishop Banister, of Kwangsi.
who arrived with his missus, were held up
and had to say grace at North Head. After
getting off the Tango Maru the travellers
were able to contemplate the beauties of
nature from the bald headland which shel-
ters the quarantined voyager who’s suspected
of having any ’flu’ germs in his possession.
There was a requiem mass for M. Georges
Playoust in St. Patrick’s Church the other day.
The Playoust family, so long resident in Syd-
ney, have given their sons and money to
France’s aid —the just-dead Georges, who died
in Paris last week, had seyen to take up arms.
Joseph, a brother of the late French wool-
buyer, has recently lost a son at the war.
The devoted president of the French-Aus-
tralian League is Mrs. Joseph Playoust, who
has allowed no war-time bereavement to
keep her away from her place in the Sydney
depot.
A languid interest centred in the brick
mansion that Rupert Clarke was recently
overlooking as it arose to his order in Syd-
ney. On the word of the owner, he was
going to live in it and a married
daughter, whose husband was at the war,
would keep house for father. Nothing could
be more prosaic. Then the Victorian baronet
intimated to local society, by a line and a
half in the “Marriage” columns of the morn-
ing papers, that lie had taken a young bride
home to the nest, which is situated at Potts
Point. She’s a Marrickville girl. Her name
was Elsie Florence Tucker, and with her
parents she came not so long ago from Eng-
land. The Registrar-General’s office-—whic:h
has lately had two or three knot-tyings of
considerable interest —was the place where
the signatures were duly recorded.
The Jack’s Day raffle, conducted by Burns,
Philp and Co., for a first-class trip for two
to Norfolk Island, has been re-donated by
the winner for the joint benefit of War
Chest Day and Jack’s Day. Burns, Philp
and Co. have now increased the prize to a
first-class round trip for two people from
Sydney and Brisbane to the Solomon Islands
(30 days’ tour), value £57, and available for
six months. Tickets, Is. each, can be obtained
from the War Chest Day committee, 115
Pitt-street, or from the firm running the
raffle.
At last week’s
gathering the Bush
Book Club disciples
(Beulah Bolton is
the earnest young
sec.) expounded the
faith of the organisa-
tion in full —briefly,
to relieve the loneli-
ness of the men or
women Outback by
supplies of varied
literature. Books
travel from the Syd-
ney centre (82
Phillip-street) to the
most remote camp in
N. S. Wales, and
few Australian
women are more
competent to have a
voice in its literary message to the great
spaces than its hon. treasurer, Dorothea
Mackellar. Slim and straight as a delicate
sapling in the bush land she loves so well,
it was this poetic daughter of Australia
whose verses, “My Country,” made quiet
English readers of the Spectator sit
up with interest. That was seven or eight
years ago. Since then Homeric battles
have been fought in the Old World,
and poets of all nationalities have
blunted their nibs in epic verse on
the heroic dead; but no line more telling
perhaps has been written than Dorothea
Mackellar’s “Core of my heart, my coun-
try!” This charming Sydney woman (the
photo is by Judith Fletcher) has recently
been recuperating, after too much war work,
in the sunburnt country round Gunnedah.
She is a daughter of Dr. Charles Mackel-
lar, M.L.C., the doughty champion of child
life, who was knighted some years ago.
Leila Doubleday’s second —and last for
the present—concert, brought a big rally
of pilgrims to the Conservatorium in Mac-
quarie-street. The Melbourne violinist has
a masterly knowledge of her instrument,
and draws the bow across the responsive
strings with unerring sweep. In spite
of iron-framed rules, a Conservatorium
audience occasionally forgot itself so far
as to applaud between the movements
of a concerto. In a frock of light green
the smiling Leila came forward to re-
ceive a load of flowers. Elsy Treweek floated
iu to sing, entirely surrounded by loose
wings of white tulle over a satin gown.
Harold Elvins was the pianist, as before.
Mrs. J. R. Robertson, of Togan Main
station (near Hay), is just back from a
health trip to the British Solomons. She
was the guest of Administrator Workman, and
had the chance of going about with an Aus-
tralian woman friend —her partner in the
jaunt —to places the average tourist doesn’t
see. Squatter Robertson, by the way, who
enlisted for the Front, is still in camp.
The recent Arts
and Crafts show
brought some strik-
ing work by local
painters on china
under the notice of
the National Gallery
trustees. Soon Syd-
ney will begin to
“feature” this at-
tractive branch of
crafts work. Designs
fresh from the plastic
touch of Nature
abound in every gully
or bush tangle,
within easy reach of
the city. Ethel At-
kinson (herewith her
photo), who studied
drawing with Alfred
Coffee some years back, afterwards went to
London. There she specialised in the tricky
craft of china-painting, for you can easily
“cook” your plates in more than one sense.
The National Gallery has just bought some
of her output in typical Australian designs.
The Red Cross committee handed over, per
its executive, £2200 as its takings from the
recent Centennial Park fete. A public park
is not the best place in the world to make
money, for it’s mostly a free show. Still,
the military sports drew a huge crowd which
spent a fair share of its cash at the stalls.
The result goes to Jack’s Day.
Leah Myers, whose velvet mezzo-soprano
notes promised a fine career, gave up the
concert platform a few years ago for vacuum-
cleaners and other domestic gods. But music
calls again. For over two years the youthful
matron has been studying under Goossens at
the Conservatorium. On November 20, in
the King’s Hall, the public will have the
chance of hearing their favorite again.
Pianist Henri Penn and Goossens himself
are in the programme.
The Women Painters’ Sketch Club briefly
stated its case—mostly in Christmas calen-
dars—for a few days last week. The little
show was housed in one of the R. A.
Society’s rooms. Olive Crane’s dashing illus-
tration, “The Princess and the Panthers,”
wore the red blob that means “Sold.”
Amongst much amateurish work the stronger
sketches by A. M. Parsons had the profes-
sional touch. Lucie Peapes, pleased in her
delicate handling of old walls covered with
Spring drapery of wistaria. L. Booth, A.
C. Creagh (in a mountain scene), M. Duret
and other members of the Club produced evi-
dence of pursuing the even tenor of their
way in water-color. Mabel Barling’s tigers
retain the slim waist-line that is characteris-
tic of her pets.
The Babies’ Welfare Society, which had
an official launching in the Town Hall vesti-
bule last week, will get into its business
stride in December. For seven days Baby
Week, a recognised event in U.S., is to be
devoted to everything that keeps Toddles and
his mamma up to date in infant hygiene.
Mrs. McDonald (the singing Kate Slattery
of years ago) got a cable from London last
week to notify her of son Steffi’s temporary
absence from the Front. He’s in a London
hospital with a wounded ankle. The Sydney
soldier is a lieut. in the King’s Own Yorks.
His wife was formerly Molly Barry, of
Sydney.
Lieut.-Colonel Marks is on his way home
to Sydney on furlough. He’s ail Anzac who
won the D. 5.0., the M.Q. and the White
Eagle of Servia, and was recently “men-
tioned” again for conspicuous bravery. This
old warrior recently celebrated his 23rd
birthday.
Donald Nettleton (Warrawee) and his
bride are honeymooning in the Apple Isle.
Mrs. Forrest, of Queensland, well known
to Bulletin readers, who went off with a
girl friend to Melbourne, won’t carelessly
chance it again in Cup-time. Rooms engaged
long before were re-let to a presumably higher
bidder. The pair, who were strangers in a
strange town, saw every prospect of
camping on the Yarra bank, the first
night of their arrival. Melbourne’s hotels
and boarding-houses were packed, with-
out _ even an available coal-bin to let as
“residential.” Eventually the travellers were
taken in at a small suburban private hospi-
tal. “We spent next morning, at high-mile-
age rates, in a hired car flying round the
town to get a shelter, and eventually found
it at South Yarra,’’ writes the Brisbane lady.
A relative of Mark Twain’s (she’s tour-
ing as Miss Clemens) stepped ashore at
Sydney last week. She is with a co. that
will tour in Queensland. Carrie Lanceley is
included in the enterprise.
Bruce Ryrie's infant son lived only for one
brief day. Daddy is at the war. The young
mother is a daughter of James, Minister
for Education.
“The Amazons” strutted their brief season
(two evenings) at the Theatre Royal last
week. The cast was good enough, but, as
Amazons, they were not a stupendous suc-
cess. Little Charmian Beit, for instance, is
about five feet in her boots. Rosamund
Lumsdaine’s slim,, boyish figure was a use-
ful asset in manly breeches, and Mrs. Venour
Nathan in boy’s togs was fairly in the pic-
ture. But the comedy is not easy for ama-
teurs, and that more seasoned society actor,
Montague Stephen, was responsible (as tlje
neurotic Tweenwayes) for such sparkle as
brightened up the performance. The pro-
ceeds to go to tlie War Chest and 19th Bat-
talion.
Mrs. Charles Waldron and her babies
went to U.S. via Vancouver in the Niagara
last week. Charles, of course, won the
Sydney girl’s heart as the “Squaw Man” a
few years ago. He is escorting the missus
and the kiddies to N’York. Ivathlene Mac-
donell was aboard the same boat.
Genthelp Stanham has not followed the
beauty-actor line of his colleague, Salt-
marshe, whose clgbut as “Cupid” in a recent
local society movie show, created such ex-
citement amongst our most soulful girls. The
good-natured Stanham evidently inclines to
tragedy, or something in the burglary line.
His appearance as a poacher, at a recent
amateur show, gave him one moment of
ferocity, in which he fought his way into the
depths of the wings without losing a drop of
blood.
The War Chest is nearly empty, and peace
won’t release its useful work for some
months. Comforts will be wanted until every
Aussie is home again. The bleak suggestion
to send Anzacs to garrison Gallipoli is alone
enough (if it’s carried out) to keep the
patriotic billy boiling. The War Chest’s Day
is November 29, and everyone concerned is
going to make it a very daddy of a Day.
Victory badges will be on sale shortly.
One of Sydney’s older parish churches,
St. Peter’s, in the Woolloomooloo section of
the city, whose ancient bell beats out a dis-
mal tinkle on Sundays, had a money-struggle
the other day. Stalls were heaped up with
the usual little bit of everything. Lady
Davidson gave the sub-regal blessing to the
effort.
The Ryde Home for Incurables, which
stands on the green slope of flower-trimmed
lawns, had a busy Saturday afternoon last
week. A sale of work, work that had
the special interest of being mostly done by
patients, was the draw. Mrs. Hugh Dixson,
who (like Miss Harris) has mothered this
haven since its struggling infancy, made
the customary remarks before business
started.
One of the handsomest kimonos this town
has seen for some time was worn, over her
frock by the way, by Miss Clemens from
U.S. It created a mild thrill when she wore
it in the street!
HOW TO STOP PAIN IN STOMACH.
THE VALUE OF MAGNESIA AND HOT
WATER.
Generations of people have employed hot
water as a soother of pain in the stomach,
but modern, physicians and specialists have
discovered and used successfully an addition
which renders the hot water trebly efficacious.
Hot water is still recommended in all cases
of stomach pain, from whatever cause aris-
ing, but still better results are obtained if a
little bisurated magnesia is added. Hot water
attracts blood to the painful part and the
bisurated magnesia neutralises the acid,
which is usually the underlying cause of
the pain. That is why such excellent results
follow combination of the two. Readers who
are subject to pain in the stomach, especially
after eating, should try this hot water and
magnesia recipe. It renders dieting quite
unnecessary, for by slowly drinking half a
glassful of hot water containing half a tea-
spoonful of bisurated magnesia immediately
after meals, the dangerous stomach acids are
destroyed, and food remains bland and sweet
until perfectly digested. The bisurated mag-
nesia, which is extensively used in hospitals,
can readily be obtained from chemists every-
where ; but to avoid confusion with the
acetates, citrates and oxides of magnesia, or
equally unsuitable mixtures of bismuth and
magnesia, it is important that bisurated
should be asked for very distinctly.— Advt.

HE ravages of warfare have opened up an enormous
field of operation for the OXY = ACETYLLN E
WELDING AND CUTTING PROCESS.
The picture above shows the remains of a large
Engineering Workshop in Albert after the Huns had
finished with it, and is typical of the wanton destruction
practised on every class of industrial workshop. Nothing
remains but broken walls and tangled masses of steelwork.
As fast as the territory is evacuated the work of repair
commences; and the indescribable tangle of steel has to be
removed.
With the OXY-ACETYLENE METAL CUTTER this
seemingly-impossible job becomes very simple, while the
damaged machinery will in most cases be repaired by the
OXY-ACETYLENE WELDING PROCESS.

CHATTER
Nightwatch’s Cup was won on a day as
grey, Sunless and still as if it were early
morning instead of late afternoon. The women
were dressed mostly in drab and grey clothes.
Cup dresses of the old showy sort were very
scarce. One woman whose dress notions
belonged to 1896, or thereabouts, paraded in
a pale pink brocaded gown cut in old-
fashioned style; she had a whole ostrich on
her head and the clothes of another ostrich
for a cape. Parasols were “off” altogether.
Mrs. Leslie Macdonald, a frocker of note,
chose the simplest garb; she wore a quiet sac
suit of grey checked tweed, and her hat blue
liat had a puggaree of navy and blue-spotted
silk. General Pau took it easy in a corner of
the vice-regal box, and seemed glad of the
rest. Dr. Crivelli talked animatedly to the
others of the Mission party. The wounded
soldiers had the committee box. They even
had the cot cases there, the lawn being dan-
gerously crowded. Willie Kelly wore a bright
green hat, a huge cigar and sundries. Mrs.
Barney Allen supported an agricultural hat
with a gold crown. It was covered with gold
corn, daisies, cornflowers and poppies. Mrs.
Eddie Waters, from Sydney 1 , wore a large pearl
on her chest. Her clothes were flimsy georgette
muffled in a furred race-coat. Racing-man
Oakley was a heavy backer of Night-
watch. Squatter Forsayth was another man
who flung up his hat when the outsider
romped in. Mrs. Tom Hogan wore a twi-
light-purple frock with a big hat of bougain-
villsea-colored velvet. Alec Wilson stood
like a tower amid the crowd on the lawn.
Mrs. Wilson was a little figure in white
alongside. The V.It.C. Committee lunched
the French party. The General left early,
chatting briskly as he was escorted to his
motor. Flying Major Harrison’s grass-widow
wore a dress in sections of buff and navy, all
pieced together with embroidery. The Rajah
wore bright-yellow boots and a gay handker-
chief flaring from the pocket of his grey suit.
The Ranee was inti filed in ermine. Sam Hor-
dern watched his horse Arch Marella lead
the field for a while. Mrs. Everard Browne
wore the darkest sables and a brown hat.
Mrs. Alister Clarke was up to her eyes in
ermine.
Oaks Day, at Flemington, was beautiful
enough to be cut out and presented as a curio
to the Weather Bureau. The sweet breeze
and sunshine, with the sparkling war news,
elevated everybody, and. when the rumor
spread that Fritz had capitulated, the
“books” needed only a couple of favorites to
drop dead to keep them in Heaven for the
rest of the meeting. As it was, Isaac sus-
pended his collection for some minutes to
roar Gor’save, etc., and give three hearty
“cheerth” for all the allied leaders he could
remember. Elsewhere the populace caught
the prevailing note. Delirious capitalists
dragged utter strangers to the champagne
buffet and hysterical females embraced the
nearest person available and wept and
squealed until the cold denial of the rumor
restored them to normal. On the lawn the
Quality jostled the Great Unparagraphed in
their attempts to catch the eye of the camera.
I saw Mrs. George Tallis proudly exhibiting
her hubby, who did not look particularly
exhausted by his recent efforts to ransack
Broadway , for 18-carat shows. The Ranee of
Pudukota, pale and languid, wore an ermine
necklet to subdue the effect of her expensive
simplicity. The Rajah, in grey suitings and
smart brown bools, was the star of a little
party. Spring chiffons and summer fictions
brought many contours nearer publicity. The
Hennessy dame and her husband chatted
with Irma Caron, who was apparelled in
brown and armed with a black cane. How-
ever, the war was practically over, so there
was no need for the weapon.
_ Steeplechase _ Day, last meeting of the
Flemington frivol, drew a north wind in
the weather consultation. The heat and
sunshine brought out all the fashion butter-
flies, who had been disguised in sober duds.
Mrs. E. Waters floated round in white chif-
fon, patterned in lilac, with a lilac sash and
sunshade. Mrs. Ivinnard had mole-colored
georgette cunningly pleated. Her sister, Mrs.
Maddern, a bride, smiled in white georgette
and a big be-ribboned hat. (All the young
and pretty women wear ribbands floating-
down their back from sailor hats.) Mrs.
Reg Wykeham looked cool in clinging trans-
parent black with a wide hat. W. A. Watt
and his wife were both severelv tailored
Barrister Woolf and his wife in blue looked
after a party of Sydney visitors. The Ranee
was smart in a black hat and tailorings of
dove color. She wore the newest thing in
vests and it buttoned right up to her chin.
Roma Clarke had on white ninon strapped
with cloth and a fantastic purple hat.
Dorothy Hidgcock arrested attention with
pink and powder-blue in bands and patclies
and a bonnet of pink forget-me-nots with' a
gold crown. Mrs. Leslie Stuart wore navy
and white. Consul Eles escorted a beauti-
fully tailored daughter, and Mrs. Dalrymple
appeared in fawn tailorings. Mrs. Alister
Clarke’s black and white ninon was a dress-
maker’s dream. She wore smothered ostrich
feathers flattened on a tulle hat. (A smoth-
ered ostrich has no curl to its feathers.)
Mrs. Hugh Denison, from Sydney, wore pat-
terned blue georgette. Doris Blackwood had
a business-like navy tailor-made. Mrs. Billy
Bayles was a smart creation in drab —she
even had drab roses on her hat.
Mrs. Otway Falkiner strolled about in
white under a wide hat of soft white
straw. Mrs. Victor Lansell was down
from Bendigo in smart trappings. Mrs.
McArthur brightened the landscape with
a purple-aiul-gold hat. Mrs. Leslie Mac-
donald showed the clansmen something
new—a straw tam-o’-shanter of bright green.
A gold swathing round her hair finished the
effect. Mavis Thiel walked in brown with
her gold hair shining through a brown tissue
hat. Parasols were all colors of the rainbow
and all shapes. An inverted bowl of white
with black markings shaded a devotee of
Magpie. A flat expanse of blue and gold had
a gold fringe, and there was a magenta brolly
with a black-and-gohl fringe. White silk
stockings and white shoes showed up every
kind of feminine leg. The fierce wind was a
great investigator and exposed all the fat
ankles.
The new Gaud Mayor’s inaugural dinner
on Saturday night was a large, excited
munch. Cabena made it a huge spread, with
Governor Stanley as chief guest. Mrs.
Cabena invited a party of women to a
dinner-party in her own special rooms, and
then took them into the balconies to listen
to the speeches.
The new Mayoress wore a cool and elab-
orate gown of transparent black lace and
green swathings. Her unfortunate husband
meanwhile sweltered in his brand-new robes
of black cloth and imported fur, with several
pounds of gold chains about his home-made
chest. The tables down below were decorated
with red flowers and edged with red, glut-
tonous faces. The councillors wore lovely
lace ruffles and knee breeches, silk stockings
and silver shoe-buckles. They would have
looked well in a Christmas panto or as
ushers at WirCis’ Circus. Little Governor
Stanley, under the sounding-board, intoned
like a lay-preacher.
In the balconies Mrs. Cabena had Mrs.
Groom on her right. Mrs. Groom’s low-cut
gown was petunia-color. Mrs. Davey, on
her left, was gorgeous in gold lace,
gold hair, transparent black and dia-
monds. Mrs. Arnold Westley sparkled
with diamonds. Mrs. Ross, from South
Africa, wore a pint of diamonds on her
chest. Mrs. Robert Harper was robed
severely in iron-grey. Mrs. Alfred Deakin
and Mrs. Brookes wore black. A bright
peacock-green gown, in straight Chinese
lines, with Chinese embroidery of gold, held
Mrs. James Dyer. Mrs. Dagnell was in
white and gold.
Anybody with a
shilling or a guinea
to spare can do a
golden deed for young
Australia by sending
it along to the Chil-
d r e n’s Hospital,
where more wards
are wanted. This
picture, by Ruth
Hollick, is of Matron
Player, who has been
in charge for years.
She explains that
the extra accommor
dation is needed for
babies. The hospital
also plans wards for
the reception of chil-
dren suffering from
acute venerea]
disease. That ought to move a heart of
stone and open a purse with a padlock on
it. The new babies’ wards are to
accommodate , 85, and there will be
annexed rooms for food preparation, milk
storage and bathing, as well as sun-boxes.
The total cost is estimated at £14,000.
There is only £BOOO of this in hand, includ-
ing a grant of £l4OO from the Government
for the venereal wards.
General Pau’s Sunday visit to the enor-
mous building of the Little Sisters of the
Poor, at Northcote, seemed to gratify him
almost more than anything. The Order is
of French origin and houses aged people.
The General was particularly interested
iii some Sisters who came from that part of
France in which Germany not long ago
held its disastrous mailed fist. The old
people assembled in the hall, where the
General, with hearty exclamations of sym-
pathy, shook hands with all. He has picked
up a bit of English, but could not trust him-
self to orate in it. One of the Sisters
translated for him. He declared that most
of the French clung to the spirit of their
religion. Therefore they won. He was an
old chap himself, he said simply. Old
fellows could only pray, but prayer was
mighty.
This week Hilda
Rix Nicholas holds
her first show of
pictures in Me 1-
bourne, after an ab-
sence of 10 years
from the Common-
wealth. She began
her training in the
Melbourne Gallery,
and so made a sub-
stantial beginning
for an art which was
afterwards to reach
maturity in Europe.
She has painted
hard and often in
England, France,
Italy, Holland,
Spain and Morocco,
and has won a repu-
tation in London, Paris, and other art
centres that secures the future to her. One
of her canvases has been bought for the
French nation and hangs in the Luxem-
bourg, Paris, while several other achieve-
ments repose in private collections. The
accompanying picture is a reproduction of
a self-portrait in crayon, a medium which
she handles with considerable vivacity. She
has done numerous other portraits, notably
some of her late husband, Major Nicholas,
D. 5.0., who was recently killed in France.
The wounded soldiers at Caulfield Military
Hospital have shown their appreciation of
General Pau’s visit to them by working a
table-centre, designed by artist Ella Gledhill.
It consists of a fleur-de-lis, with a laurel
wreath in the centre. Every stitch was put
in by the patients, the spinal cases doing the
biggest share, under the designer’s direction.
A veteran of the battle of Mons, Dr. Hart-
ridge, is now practising at Port Fairy, one of
the beautiful, breezy Western District sea-
ports which the Victorian Government is
still doing its best to keep in the fishing-
village class. Hartridge was in England
when the war began, and joined the R.A.M.G.
there, presently crossing over to France with
the old “Contemptibles."
Melbourne Grammar claims for its honor-
roll the late Major Charles Booker, who re-
cently died in France from wounds received
in action. Major Booker was born in
Kent (Eng.) 21 years ago, and came to
Melbourne with his parents as a boy. His
father was. Dawson Booker, who toiled in the
banking business here for some years, and
the late Major had his early schooling at
Grammar before the family returned to Eng-
land, w T here they still live. The fine young
officer, who belonged to the Royal Air Force,
had the D.S.C. and the French Ci’oix de
Guerre, with star and palm.
Kate Cornell is inaugurating a new club
in Melbourne. It will be known as the
Melbourne Social Club for Women, and will
hang out its shingle in the Stock Exchange
Buildings, Collins-street. The organiser’s
idea seems to be to encourage liberty, equality
and fraternity, or something splendid like
that. There are to be no rigid rules, no
cliques and no superiority. The subscrip-
tion is only a guinea.
If possible, the M.S.C. will be a resi-
dential club later on. In the meantime the
secretary will look up quarters for country
members visiting town. Girls working in
town are now rushing in. They can go
to the club from their offices, brush up and
have some food and rest before an evening’s
entertainment. Hot baths as well as tea are
to be had.
.Freda Sternberg left Sydney by the
Niagara last week to take up work on a Van-
couver paper.
The Premier and Mrs. Lawson, the del-
egates to the Children’s Welfare Conference,
and the Mayor of Malvern and Mrs. McKin-
ley all join in paste-board invitations to a
reception in the Malvern Town Hall on
Monday evening, December 2.
Dr. Charles McCarthy lately drifted
through to the Apple Island, where he is
fishing and sketching. He made a

Adelaide’s despatch :—•
What with the French Mission and the Trench
Comforts appeal this has been a strenuous week.
Fired by the success (financial, if not artistic) of
Melbourne and Sydney’s amateur cinema plays, the
local Comforts Committee decided to do likewise, with
the result that the Town Hall has been packed
to overflowing for three nights, and the season has
been extended. The big scene is a garden-party —
in Government House grounds.
Friday was dedicated to the Women Battalions’
march and button sales in the streets and the
arrival of the French Mission. The Mission was
almost smothered in flowers and deafened by the
cheers, and when it had passed the women collected
themselves from the various strong posts and made
for Flinders-street to fall in. The regimental colors
of the different units, formed by the feminine next-of-
kin of the men at the Front, were the main
features of the parade.
Meanwhile the French Mission was whisked from
the train to the Grand Central, where it was allowed
a brief interval for bath and breakfast. Then came
a visit to Government House, another to the Chief
Secretary, and finally the public reception at the
Town Hall. In the evening there was a reception
at Government House, where Lady Galway radiated
smiles from a picture frock of blue brocade (for
many years France was her home, and she loves all
things French) and gallant General. Pau kissed the
hands of three or four hundred women as they filed
past him.
The Andrew Smiths’ son, Ross, has added a bar to
his Flying Cross. A Military Cross, with bar, was
already amongst his possessions.
The balance-sheet of the 1918 appeal of the Army
Department of the Y.M.C.A. shows that £48,000 was
collected at an expense of close on £3OOO.
The estate of the late C. A. Reinecke has been
sworn not to exceed £428. Most of his property
was settled on his wife at the time of his marriage.
Lady Galway has booked her passage for a trip
to Honolulu, and will leave as soon as she can get
clear of engagements. Since war broke out she has
given her time and strength unceasingly to Red Cross
and other patriotic work.
Daisy Cathcart, daughter of the Balfour
Cathcarts, of Horsham, is getting her glory-
box ready. She is to marry returned sol-
dier Francis Fetherstonhaugh, son of Cap-
tain Fetherstonhaugh and Mrs. Fetherston-
haugh, of St. Kilda.
Deputy Chief-Censor McColl’s daughter
Vera was married on the last day of October
to Robert Lush, of Oak wood estate, a son of
timber-magnate George Lush. Recent melan-
choly war-events confined the proceedings
within family limits and made the ceremony
a very Scotch one. Eric Finlay steered the
bridegroom into position for the knot-tying
by Scots parson John Gillies, and there was
a considerable variety of tartans represented
in the gathering of relatives which presently
took a bite of oatcake at the McColl table.
A bride of Geelong scored a gay bouquet
the other day. A clergyman at the mayoral
reception to General Pau had to hurry away
to a wedding, so made his excuses to the
General. The prompt old soldier thrust his
presentation bouquet, with tricolor stream-
ers, into the reverend’s hands, bidding him
take it with his love to the bride. So the
lady was flattered and an elderly gentleman
was gracefully rid of something he had no
use for.
Alice, daughter of Dr. Cecil Purser, who
married Donald Nettleton, son of the late
Sam Nettleton, of Warrawee (N.S.W.L
arrived from Hobart with her bridegroom,
in time to see the Cup won. The pair
honeymooned in the Speck.
Pianist Horace Gleeson, now local mana-
ger for a piano co. in Maoriland, lately
shared the honors of a successful concert
with visiting flautist Amadio in Wellington.
Amadio had a good trip through Maoriland,
and is now back in Melbourne planning
more musical journeys.
Pianiste Doris Madden, musical niece of
the late C.J., is off to America at an early
date to study. Adelaide Allan, Mrs. Masson,
Mrs. Spencer, Dr. Helen Sexton, the Frank
Mitchells and others are organising a fare-
well concert, which will be given late in
November at the rooms of the Victorian
Artists on Eastern Hill. There is a subscrip-
tion afoot.

NOTIONS
Good liorse though Magpie is only the
wildest optimist would reckon him having a 6 to 4 on
chance against Wolaroi over a mile at w.f.a. Yet
this was offered and taken in the Linlithgow Stakes
—Wolaroi and Outlook each at 6’s, Panacre and
Cetigne at B’s. Perhaps it may have been due to
the imported article having an allowance of 31b.
on the scale, but even that was no justification for
such odds about the favorite. Wolaroi is one of the
most brilliant horses ever raced in Australia over a
middle distance, and for backers to put Outlook on
the same mark and give him only an outside chance
against Magpie was merely an exhibition of their
eternal foolishness. This writer would doubt whether
there was ever a horse foaled which could be counted
to have an odds-on chance of beating Wolaroi on his
day at the end of a mile. Over the last furlong
of eight he is wonderfully good. Magpie began well.
He reached the straight first and at seven furlongs,
though Bullock was riding him hard to hold his place,
looked a sure winner. It was here Wolaroi took a
hand, so to speak, and closing on the leader at the
half-distance, beat him a head in the run to the line.
Melbourne found it easier to remember Magpie
beating Desert Gold than to recollect Wolaroi the
Derby winner and appropriator of the Linlithgow
a couple of seasons back.
* * * *
Keniiaquhair took the C. B. Fisher Plate
like a good horse. It was his first win at w.f.a., but
there are many who saw the Spring Stakes at ltand-
wick who believe that something different might have
occurred had he been ridden with better judgment
in that event. Anyway he was punched along at a
sprint for over a mile, and burst just where it was
most inconvenient. On Saturday in the Plate Magpie
was again at odds on, Kennaquhair and Wolaroi at
three. There was no hanging back for a sprint home
this time. Wood put Kennaquhair at it from the
barrier, and Bullock had a hard job once or twice
to keep Magpie going. The pace was very solid.
Ridden right out the Englishman put up a good
fight over the last lialf-furlong; but the Metrop.
winner had too much ginger in him, and won by a
neck. He ran the mile and a half with 9st. in
“324,” having made his own pace. There is not
much doubt now about the name of the gamest and
soundest stayer racing in Australia. The next thing
to notice will be the steps taken by the handicappers
to stop him or bring him into line with something
not worth feeding. After the Melbourne Cup £6OOO
was put on offer for Kennaquhair. The answer was
“No.” Certainly it was a lot of money, but with
reasonable luck no more than the nag has a chance
of appropriating still.
* * * *
Lowry, owner of Desert Gold, got tired of
it after Melbourne Cup day. The experiment of
hanging on to the mare had given no encourage-
ment to do it again, and backing Killowen like a
certainty in the Yan Yean Stakes had only led to
watching the good thing arrive at the wrong end.
Wherefore Lowry decided there was no place like
home, and announced that his team of nags would
be given a rest and the benefit of sea air. Taking
things by and large, the Maorilanders’ Spring offen-
sive was a great disappointment to them. Green-
wood’s appropriation of the A.J.C. Derby with
Gloaming had its bitterness in the break-up of
Biplane. The Stead enterprises with Almoner and
Killmoon were not particularly cheerful. Lowry’s
luck was clean out, so far as the bigger things went,
anyhow. Desert Gold struck two or three snags, but
there is no doubt about it that Lowry had very good
reasons for thinking her unbeatable. Even after
everything has been said, it still remains as true as
ever that Desert Gold is a beautiful mare, the finest
specimen of her sex ever raced on an Australian
track. _ In conformation, action and disposition Desert
Gold is the kind of thoroughbred seen at only rare
intervals. Though beaten in Australia, her share in
the victory of the winning horses was almost as
great as their own. In every race she started in at
w.f.a. the winner both on this trip and the last had
to do the journey in record time. There is no reason
to suppose that she is not as good now as ever she
was. She must have a constitution of iron.
* * * *
The yarn now goes that Finmark’s arrival
in fourth place at the end of the Melbourne Cup
shows his running in the Derby to have been “all
wrong.” Why? A Derby is not a handicap or
anything like one, and it "is only by stretching the
imagination to bursting-point that a horse carrying
7st. 71b. into fourth place in a two-mile handicap
can be said to thereby show he ought not to have
been third with Sst. iolb. over a mile and a half.
There was no merit about the fourth either. Fin-
mark at no stage looked a winner, nor did he
challenge the placed horses. He simply lobbed home
fourth, well beaten. If that Cup was run again, and
the field reduced by half, there would be odds
against Finmark being in the first half-dozen.
* * * *
The winners of the two richest stakes in
Australia this year—the A.J.C. Derby and the Mel-
bourne Cup—are not considered likely to do much in
the way of improving the local thoroughbred. Any-
way, they both happen to be geldings.
* * * *
“Mujik”; Out of 30 races at Flemington
and Williamstown backers of favorites collected four
times, a circumstance which reminds the writer of a
system. According to this, and the number of people
who are ready to believe the yarn, a citizen who
starts with £1 and doubles the stake on each success-
ive bet is bound to come out a winner. Possibly he
is—if he can stay long enough. It happens that on
the collapse of the eleventh favorite the citizen would
be shy £3184, and to carry on the game would be
putting up £2032 on the twelfth. If this animal
missed (and there would be a very solid reason why
it should) the citizen would be looking for the odds
to £4064 on the next to get back the £4200 already
in the pool. I cannot say I ever tried the system out
to the bitter end, but if anyone can get all the banks
in Australia to stand behind him the thing might be
worth going through with. Meanwhile, looking on
seems a safer way of keeping a wad under control.
*** ■ *
“Y.Z.”: It was at Flemington on Cup
Day. Under the elms a vast, perspiring herd of
maddened men were struggling with just the air of
a crowd that is fighting its way out of a burning
theatre, the desperate aim of each being to thrust
more and more pound-notes, halves, singles, fivers
and tens, upon a few helpless bookmakers, tied, as it
were, like martyrs to the stake, and utterly in-
THE LINE OF SAFETY.
“I'm glad I'm not back in Aussie, Bill.”
“ 'Ow’s that?”
“I'd a’ done all me dough on the Cup.”
capable of offering any effective resistance. To one
sufferer, whose cries for help had flecked him with
foam, and who was frantically stuffing money offered
him into a big leather bag in the poor, foolish hope
of averting that moment when it would bury him,
and give him over to a terrible death by suffocation,
came the torn and breathless city clerk disguised in
dust. “What price Princess Lucy?” gasped he, hang-
ing wildly to his seething neighbors to keep his head
above the stream. “Eights to one,” replied the book-
maker piteously. “Make it tens,” pleaded the city
clerk. “Garni” howled the bookmaker. “Think of
the high cost of living.”
* * * »
“Spreader”: It is the same old story again
this year—practically all the big races won either
by the nag: that is “imp.” or by the sire that was
“imp.” Likewise it is the old business over again,
though a bit more so, of dozens of two-year-olds
being run off their immature feet and the survivors
of any quality at a more advanced age being horribly
few. There is quite a whole lot wrong with this
business. To begin with, the fact that Australia,
with many rich prizes on offer locally and no outlet
for the surplus moke, finds it necessary to import
nearly the whole of the sire blood is of itself evi-
dence of the business being in a calamitous mess. It
must be obvious to even a pony-doper that the
thoroughbred as a national asset is negligible if we
are incapable of breeding horses up to the same
standard as the parent stock. Whether the most dis-
astrous influence on the Australian horse is the mania
for two-year-old racing or the obsession breeders labor
under with regard to “laws of mating” is a matter
for speculation. Both are deplorable, anyway. Two-
year-old racing on the lines followed hereabouts is
simply butchery. Breeding is carried on upon lines
having little commonsense and giving results by acci-
dent. Selecting strains and breeding to them is no
way to arrive at individual excellence. That comes
under that system only at odd intervals, when the
mates are reasonably suited to each other, and both
pedigrees go back without flaw. Though great
horses are occasionally found without clean pedigree
it is because the pure-blood on the back lines has
been strong enough to outweigh other influences. One
thing stands out clear in breeding absolutely
thoroughbred to its kind —and that is that unless
the individuals “correct” each other no pedigree ever
framed will ensure success. Otherwise how is it
that the champion is always “in the hat” at the
yearling sales —that no one can tell what a foal
is going to be like under trial? A mare mated
to a Musket blood and type of horse may throw a
colt back to St. Simon if she is of that strain and
type, and in after years that same colt will put
St. Simon influence into every pedigree his name
appears on. If his get are any good Musket will
get the kudos. And so the vicious circle goes on.
Trainers are killing our young horses, especially the
fillies. Breeders are going mostly on the blind
with sires, following one whim after another without
regard for individual characteristics. Wherefore
the frequent “imp.”
Again about early racing: The four big Spring
handicaps—the Epsom, Metrop. and the two Cups—
have this year been won by horses of which (1) two
did not start at two years; (2) one ran only twice
and unsuccessfully late in the season; and (3) one
started frequently, but did not register a win. Of
the two Derbies one winner .was not used at two
years; the other winner started seven times, but
only hit the front once. Of w.f.a. winners at Rand-
wick and Flemington one, Magpie, was given only
three spins at two years, arfd won only once. An-
other, Poitrel, was not seriously raced at that age.
He had three late runs. Cetigne was kept busy,
being started eight times. Estland was kept hard iit
it, starting 16 times —and of 1 w.f.a. winners this
year Estland is the least like one, and won from the
poorest field. The greatest disappointment of the
Spring, Finmark, was persisteiitly raced at two. In
13 starts he was only unplaced once. Of last
season’s top-notchers and frequent runners in Aus-
tralian juvenile contests there are Outlook, Sweet
Lady, Almoner, Dunwil, to point the moral, whatever
it may be—likewise Tragic Star, Dick Meagher and
a few others. How many of these will be triers at
w.f.a. next year—and how many of them might not
have been had their youth been not made so hard?
* * * *
“Trot”: The House of Judah must have
had a rare good win at Flemington. Scarcely a
favorite arrived, and though this docs not always
mean a jubilee for Ike the balance left behind by
the crowd on the course was pretty
solid. The ante-post proceedings were
all in Ike’s favor. On the Cup the
rake-off can only be guessed at, just
as the profit from the burst-up doubles
for which everyone was rushing up till
Caulfield remains a matter of specula-
tion. The yarns about big King Offa
and Nightwatch doubles can be heavily
sprinkled with salt. When King Offa
won, the gelding was simply not in
the picture. A few doubles had pos-
sibly been taken—but mighty few.
And on the day more than a dozen
horses were better backed than the
winner. Meanwhile the Age remarks
that the annexations by the ring from
backers were so voluminous as to
make the case for the tote at Fleming-
ton unanswerable. But does it. To
the writer the only thing it seems
to make unanswerable is the cofiten-
tion that backing horses is a silly
business. You can pick just as few
winners on the tote as in Jerusalem,
and it is an inescapable fact that if
the crowd leaves cash behind now it
also must leave a big donation on the
premises if it deals with a machine.
Another obvious fact is that the afore-
said donation goes for ever—that it
cannot be recovered. Of course there
is a strong argument to be made for
the totalisator, but trying to make
out that the man who goes a-punting
will be any better off at the end of
a week or a year by trying to find
them on the tote than discovering
them by machinery is absurd. The
sound doctrine is that to the average man there is
nothing calamity in the game, anyway.
‘Glen Huntly’’: There is something
pathetic in the faith of punters in Melbourne Cup
lavontes. Despite last year’s lesson, when the
allegedly unbeatable Lanius went out at 7 to 4 and
was unplaced, the multitude this year rushed to back
King Offa at 7 to 2 and even 2 to 1. In the last 20
years there have been 26 Cup favorites, and 18 have
been unplaced ; only four managed to win, two ran
into second place, and two scored thirds. The
winners have included 50, 40, 33 (2), 25 and 20
(2) to 1 chances, and eight nags that started at
from 10 to 16 to 1. The three placed horses this
year went out at 12, 14 and 33 to 1 respectively.
Either Australia’s old friend Sasanof
must have improved a ton or Gloaming has been
getting tired. After Sasanof had won the M.L. Cup
and doaniing the C.J.C. Derby last week the two
geldings collided in the Stead Memorial, a mile and
a half w.f.a. event. Sasanof won by two lengths,
but as the time cabled to Sydney is "given as 3min.
3sec., the question of whether Gloaming stopped on
the journey to celebrate peace or merely have a
drink remains a dark, inscrutable mystery.
“Pungawerewere”: T. PI. Lowry, the
owner of Desert Gold, has been racing in Maoriland
for nearly 30 years. The first horse with which he
became prominent in the Hawkes Bay district, where
he lives, was a gelding called Gondolier, which won
many jumping races, including the Hawkes Bay
Steeplechase. In 1896, at the sale of the Wellington
Park yearlings, he bought the St. Leger—Sapphire
colt St ; Conon, and tried to win the New Zealand
Cup with him; but the colt did rot survive his
preparation, though he did a big gallop at Riccar-
ton over a mile and a quarter in such good time as
to justify the belief that, had he stood up, he must
have gone very near winning. Royal Fusilier and
Madrigal were two other good horses owned by
Lowry; but Desert Gold, of course, was the pick of
the basket.

“L.L.W.”: Perkins, who was considered
a mug by the rest of us, remarked contemptuously
that only two classes went to races. “Anyhow,” he
added, “only a fool could fail to spot the winner in
every race.” The fellows made loud noises by way
of answer. “Here,” says Gerkins hauling out a race-
book, “mark them on this. I’m going to the races
to-morrow, and I’ll bet you two pounds to one you
can’t mark a winner.” “You’re on,” says Perkins
quietly, reaching for the book. They put the money
up, and then, before us all, Perkins took out a pencil
and marked every horse in the book! Then the riot
broke loose. The money is not yet paid over, and
Gerkins refuses to submit to arbitration. He says
Perkins is forcing him to commit murder.
When Les Darcy’s little brother “Frosty”
transpired as a preliminary battler at Sydney
Stadium a couple of years or so ago the resemblance
between the pair was a mirthful circumstance which
seemed likely to get Frosty into trouble. Since then
the resemblance of the lad to the dead champion has
grown so marked as to be almost uncanny, and his
troubles about a punch not very serious. On Satur-
day Frosty was put against Dan Tiernan, an experi-
enced welter with an unceremonious wallop, at Syd-
ney Hippodrome. In the fourth Dan and his wallop
went to sleep. Frosty has developed into a hefty
adolescence. He is not unlikely to be heard of again,
though distinction in biff does not often run in
families.

Two of Sydney’s liveliest schoolboy
cricketers had a busy time in the Newington-Sydney
Grammar School match in G.P.S. cricket last week.
W. G. Brown (Newington) banged up 156 (out of
293) and then almost cleaned up the opposing side by
taking eight wickets for 106. M. B. Hesslein (Gram-
mars) piled up 100 (out of 246). ’Tween school
fixtures Brown puts on the pads with Balmain in
Sydney first-grade cricket. Last year he averaged
19.30 for seven innings. This season he began with
a merry 68 (top score) against Central Cumberland.
Hesslein got into the limelight two years ago by
amassing 243 of Sydney Grammar’s 848*against Scot’s
College. This year (partnered with L. S. Aitken) he
won Sydney Grammar tenWs doubles championship.
He is also a fine Rugby three-quarter and one of the
greatest of school place-kickers.

Plain turkeys are plentiful up this way
(Bananaland), and, having bagged scores of them, I
can guarantee them big strong birds, requiring a
hefty clout at 40 yards before appearing on the
menu. Yet there are sports who credit the turkey
with the Vitality of a tomtit. One of many in-
stances, using No. 1 shot at the above distance: Shot
through the head with right barrel and downed with
left on rising. Eventually captured per boot; throat
cut and carried 150 yards to buggy. On arrival there
the bird was still alive, and its neck had to be
broken. It had been shot all over the head and
through both eyes. An almost similar experience
occurred a few days later. Nevertheless “E.S.J.”
(B. 19/9/’18) bleats of someone killing a turkey with
No. 4 shot at 1284 yards 1 The evidence of a man
who even admits firing at such a distance can be cut
out every time. A lunatic would not be guilty of
such action. If these long-range perjury purveyors
could only be induced to go fishing they would catch
more submarines tlian Von Hoggenskunk ever
dreamed of.
* * * *
“I. Say”: Didn’t “Nimrod” go off the track
by remarking (B. 26/9/’18), incidental to his allega-
tion about no rifle being accurate enough to break a
pipe-bowl at 100yds., that “the finest grouping ever
attained at 100yds. is a 2in. circle” ? Better groups
were made 40 years back with a muzzle-loading .500
and a double .450. I have seen a better group made
with a .577, and the implement stands in the corner
as I write. Anyhow, if I stick a pipe-bowl in a
2in. circle “Nimrod” is going to have a hard job to
get a bullet into the circle without damaging the
smoking apparatus. But why drag in groups? To
kill a cocky at 600yds. or smash a pipe at 100yds.
are possible flukes —-but to slay a dozen cockies with
a dozen shots would be a blanky miracle.
* * * *
“Red Fin”: I beg to differ from “John
Quill,” who states that the Murray River is capable
of supporting the fishing industry as practised bv
‘professional fishermen.” Rockley (N.S.W.) is not
the only town where the depredations of illicit fish-
ing have spoilt the angler’s afternoon on the river.
At Albury (N.S.W.) right on the banks of the
Murray (the home waters of the cod) it is now im-
possible to get a decent day’s sport without travel-
ling 20 or 30 miles up or down stream. The local
police strategist there got to work lately and
succeeded in making a great haul of drum nets,
cross lines and wire traps and hauling two “sports”
before the Beak. The drum nets each had a spread
of 25ft. One of the wire traps salvaged measured
12ft. by 6ft., being constructed on three heavy cart-
wheel tyres. The proprietor used a draught horse to
pull his sporting apparatus out of the wet. Yet if
one goes to buy fish he is asked Is. per lb. by the
worthy Dago, who buys it for half that from “pro-
fessional fishermen.” The same meat is sold in the
Melbourne markets for sd. or 6d. Where is the
Foods Commission and its necessary commodities?
“John Quill”: The accursed carp, like all
other useless pests hereabouts, is an importation.
It is a native of Italy, whence it was brought over
40 years ago by the N.S.W. Government, to whom it
had been misrepresented as a prolific and highly-
edible fish growing to seven or eight pounds in
weight. Large numbers of them were foolishly
dropped into the Fish and Campbell rivers, which are
the headwaters of the Macquarie, the first western
stream in the State to he polluted by their presence.
Since then they have spread rapidly to the Maclntyre
and other north-western rivers. They were not known in
the south-western waterways until last year, when
they were found in the headwaters of the Murrum-
bidgee. The carp is certainly prolific, but it cannot
be classed as edible. The flesh of a specimen up to
lib. is passable if the diner has a nigger’s patience
to extract the bones, but when over this weight the
meat is like sawdust. Carp gorge on the spawn of
the cod, which they are steadily decreasing, and on
the larvae of the mosquito, on whose number and
size they seem to have no effect, for fishermen on the
Macquarie still use them for bait.

The Bathurst (N.S.W.) Homing Pigeon
Club has just closed its season with a fly from
Charleville (Q.), which is considered as the premier
event of the year. The distance between Bathurst
and Charleville as the “crow flies” is 559 miles.
The prize was won by A. Brook’s flier, averaging a
velocity of 909 yards Ift. 10in» per minute, G. Hill’s
bird arrived 52 minutes later with an average of
866 yards 11 ft., and W. McKenna’s nominee took
third prize at 805 yards 3in. per minute.

THE DARK HORSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though not an animal to fill
The eyes of punters callow,
Or cause the “birdcage” belles to thrill
With admiration shallow,
’Twas plain to those who really knew
The nag was meant great things to do.
The points that made for speed and strength
By me were duly noted ;
Its legs were right, its height and length
Correct; in fact, I voted
It was the equine for my cash,
Possessed of staying pow’r and dash.

Of temper, build or action ;
One thing, however, gave me cause
For deep dissatisfaction—•
Its merits I had failed to trace
Till after it had won the race!

Individual Fitness
This is the time when our people need to
be strong of muscle and steady of nerve.
Hysterical people are of no use in war-
time. When they try to help they hinder.
Fitness should start with the individual.
If you are run down and nervous, pale and
lacking in strength to do your part, you need
more blood.
If your hand, your thumb or foot trembles
when you try to hold it still, if the lines are
shaky when you write, if you have tremors
of your lips or chin, your nerves need
strengthening.
Proper food and a good tonic will keep
most people in good health. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People are the most
popular tonic medicine in the world, harm-
less, non-alcoholic and certain in their action,
which is to build up the blood and to restore
vitality to the run-down system. For those
who are failing in strength Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills are an ideal tonic.
Write for the free booklet, “Diseases of the
Nervous System,” to the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Co., Box 594 G.P.0., Sydney. Your own
chemist or storekeeper sells the pills, or they

By the dimmer of a flickering lamp,
And half covered by a rug,
In a opium hell a woman lags
Unconscious from the drug,
Lost to the awfulness of the place,
And the gibbering Chinamen,
Fantastic visions filled her dreams—-
Within the drowsy den,
A once lady of society,
And a true and faithful wife,
Till deserted by her husband—
In the blossoms of her life,
The wine cup and opium—
Their fatal charm did cast,
A blank to the fallen woman —
Were the memories of the past,
By the glimmer of a flickering lamp,
And half covered by a rug,
Enchanted was her slumber ’neath—
The influence of the drug.

The collapse of the last of Germany’s
props is causing some South Australians to
criticise the necessity for the huge writing
in ten-feet letters on the wall of Government
House, “We Are in Grave Danger.” The
Bulletin hopes that the warning will not
be removed even after there is nothing to be
feared from the Hun. There is the tariff-
sinking crowd still at large.
“A Wireless Billjim”: Our handyman had
just completed a fine wooden cross for the
grave of still another of our little mob in
Mesopotamia. It was lying across two beer
cases (empty), and when the painting of
the name, number, unit, etc., had been neatly
done, the operator took his chalk, and, in
bold, block letters, inscribed this lengthwise
on the tribute: “For G —d’s sake don’t sit
on 'this—it’s wet.”
“Dinkus”: Motor-bikes are peevish and
unsympathetic things at the best of times,
but on service they seem to develop malig-
nantly ingenious tricks unknown elsewhere.
Owing to the country having the appearance
of the surface of the moon, and the roads
being non-existent, I left the sidecar one
morning at what had once been a cross-
roads. Fritz thoroughly strafed the place
regularly every day from 12 noon till 1.30
p.m., so I reckoned to be back at 11.30, and
well away before the hate arlived. Was
back on time, confidently hopped into the
sidecar, and told the driver to let her go
“toot sweet.” The engine started all right,
but wouldn’t pull. As soon as the clutch
went in, the engine went out. We tried and
tested every likely, and a lot of unlikely,
things. An A.S.C. lorry-driver was pressed
into service, but as a few shells were coming
over he “got windy” and took himself and
his lorry away. As I was debating whether
to leave the machine and bolt for a dugout,
two o.9’s arrived simultaneously, and the
surrounding landscape fell on us in chunks.
We arose in a frenzy and my driver gave the
starter a despairing kick. That did the
trick somehow; the engine woke up properly,
and, as we went tearing down the road,,
the day’s avalanche of strafe arrived punctu-
ally, and the place we had just left was all
dust, smoke and flying iron. We hit the
road only about every iOO yards, and the
engine, in all its cranky career, never ran
better. Still, I wouldn’t put the boot into
my motor-bike as a regular thing.

The main feature of the September-October list, apart
fr . m the splendid array of talent, is 1 the wide range of
musical compositions offered for selection. Practically
every taste is catered for, and the usual high Edison
standard is ably maintained by the aggregation of numbers
here presented.
Lovers of Sousa’s Band Marches will welcome the inclu-
sion of two of the celebrated Composer’s works —rendered
in characteristic style by the New York Military Band.
There are a couple of fin > vocal concerted numbers by
the Premier Quartet, which are sure to be great favorites,
and Manuel Romain’s “Girl You Can’t Forget” is worth
going a long way to hear.
Of the rest, “I’m a Poor Married Man,” by Billy Murray:
“For You and Rose,” by George Wilton Ballard; and
the “Low-Eaek’d Car” of Walter Van Brunt are a very
fine lot. But really every number is good of its particular class—the selection of
favorites, therefore, will be more a matter for individual taste.

AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORT.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 20 of the Commonwealthßank Act, 1911-IGI4, I
have to report that the Aggregate Balance Sheet of the Commonwealth Ban.: of Australia for the
half-year ended 30th June, 1918, has been examined by officers under my direction, as well
as bv mvself. The several items of the account, as above set forth, have been verified with the
books and vouchers, with the Securities held by the Bank, and with Statements certified by the
respective Managers and Accountants of the Bank.
I have obtained all the information and explanations required by me. The said Balance Sheet
has been prepared in the form prescribed by the Regulations under the Act, and, in my opinion, it
exhibits a correct view of the affairs of the Bank.
I have also to report that the sum of £10,102,175 above set forth was held by the Bank in Gold
Coin for the Treasurer of the Commonwealth.

Stop Torturing
Toothache Quickly.
Stopain Toothache Gum
Instantly Ends The Ache
And Helps Save The Tooth.
Don’t put up with toothache a minute. You
don’t have to. Just put a little piece of Stopain
Toothache Gum in the cavity, or around the
tooth and all pain is gone as if by magic.
m
u
Let STOPAIN Stop That Boring Pain.
It fills up the cavity, excluding the air, and
stopping the mouth acids from acting on the
frantic, jumping nerve; hardens quickiv, and
forms a serviceable filling that will last for a
long time—until you are ready to have a per-
manent filling put in.
Why punish yourself ? Why endure the
agony of toothache when a shilling box of
Stopain Toothache Gum will quickly restore
your peace of mind ?
Keep it on hand for emergencies.
Stopain Toothache Gum is sold by most
medicine vendors at a shilling a box, or sent

Drives Away
Corns doily.
At last a real ‘ does what it says ’ Corn Cure;
nothing like it or just as good has ever been
known.
Every man or woman who has corns, warts
or bunions ought to try Handy Corn Cure at
once and see how marvellously it works. Quit
shaving your corn with a razor. You may draw
mood and cause blood-poisoning.
m
Handy Corn Cure will get rid of every corn
you have got without pain or discomfort.
Handy Corn Cure is remarkable because it
never irritates or turns the true flesh sore or
raw. It can’t—it’s that antiseptic, safe and
harmless. The corn shrivels up and comes out.

Cranky disposition—yellow 100k —terrible headaches—dulled brain.
All these things spell Biliousness, which is the direct result of a liver which
fails to perform its functions in a natural way.
Before you can free yourself of that bilious condition you must get your
liver in form, and nothing will accomplish this so quicklv or so thoroughly
as Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach and liver.
This remedy is the most valuable one obtainable for all liver and
kindred troubles, possessing properties which drive it directly to the affected
parts. Better than pills, oils, salts and nauseous purgatives which leave the
sufferer in worse condition than before.

Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
iatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and. if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
time and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain's Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy w.ch
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand all danger
jnay be avoided.
Be Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
i. ever fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

The Denby is able to use a smaller motor and save you fuel expense,
because the power losses with the internal-gear axle are so much
less than with any other form of drive.
The only power you are interested in is the usable power delivered
at the wheels. And Denby delivers its greatest power at the slower
speeds, when the load is heavy or the road rough.
That is only one of a score of points of Denby dominance.

John Lewis lias raised the question in S.A.
Leg. Council of the whereabouts of the boun-
dary between that State and Westralia. His
idea is that it is vague, and that the two
States may drift into a dispute such as
worried S.A. and \ ictoria for half a century,
and took a mountain of money to settle. The
S.A. Government has promised to have a
look round the mound before it has to climb
over it.
“D.F.”: There were some bold seadogs in
Australian vessels in the early days. About
IS3O Captain Steyne circumnavigated the
world in the 26-ton cutter Emma Kemp, in
order to bring coffee and tobacco from Rio de
Janiero to Hobart. He made his outward
voyage by the Horn and came back by the
Cape of Good Hope. Steyne had a crew
of five, and was the only man on board who
could read or write.
The sudden processes of compulsory agri-
culture in Britain went so far as the sum-
mary ejectment of incompetent farmers, and
they are certainly producing results. In
1918 the wheat crop was 96,000,000 bushels,
as compared with the old average 60,000.000
in 1917. The increase represents rather
more than the usual Australian supply, which
the Cold Country has learned, under compul-
sion, to pretty well dispense with. J. Bull
hopes to keep on with the good work, and
to make it permanent he has undertaken to
buy the crop at a fixed price, not only dur-
ing the war but for some years afterwards.
It is his fixed desire nowadays, based on war
experience, to make the supplier of raw
materials as superfluous as possible.
“Ida D.”: Re the Home Service badge.
What about the rejection badges? One of
my brothers, who was turned aside by the
doctor, was refused a badge on the ground
“that under the conditions set down for the
issue of these badges, he was not entitled to
same.” He was rejected on account of an
intermittent malaria, contracted in the
tropics. As he had three brothers at the
Front since the beginning, and another wait-
ing to go into camp, and as he is a strap-
ping six-footer, lie was getting a bad time
from the usual “Why-aren’t-you-in-khaki?”
enthusiast, who nearly always fastens to the
wrong man. I was working in a recruiting
office at the time, so we placed the matter
before the Central Recruiting Committee
with the result that we were informed that
“if your brother will enlist again, the matter
of a rejection badge will be considered!”
Now, what do you think of that?
“Hr” : Right through the present British
pushes (I’m writing from where they are
being delivered) Blighty leave is being con-
tinued with joyful regularity; and that, in
itself, shows the difference _ that the rapid
materialisation of the American troops has
made. Between the commencement of the
German offensive in March and the begin-
ning of June leave was stopped absolutely.
The stoppage came so suddenly that men
who had boarded the leave-boat were ordered
back again, while at least one train-load of
soldiers were turned back after reaching
London itself. Britain and France were
raked for absentees; and even men from hos-
pital, who were not fully cured, were hurried
back to reinforcement concentration camps.
The round-up had some queer results; for
instance, over a hundred Australians who
had been lost sight of and had managed to
live away from their units on the strength
of their uniforms, were rounded up in one
day in Boulogne alone.
Four joyous years ago the price of im-
ported paper began to go up like a balloon,
and it went up 500 per cent, in many cases,
including freight. Terrified lest these figures
should set a big local industry going the
Commonwealth Government made it clear that
any miscreant who was found starting a
local industry would be liable to have most
of his profits seized under the War Profits
tax. Also when the war was over he might
expect to be left to face the old hopeless
problem—so far at least as the principal
items of the business were concerned —of
reconciling high wages and short hours with
cheap imports. Incidentally he would be
described, even if he sold his goods at one-
third the importer’s war-price, as a heart-
less profiteer who was tearing the loaf out
of the jaws of the poor. But now that paper
is becoming scarce at any price, people learn
that the N. S. Wales Government has been
thinking for a long time about creating a
State paper industry with borrowed money
and hasn’t done anything yet. Still it has
sent some local timber abroad to see what
kind of paper it will make, instead of trying
the article in a small way here for the sake
of experience, and it will by-and-bye begin
the usual lengthy negotiations with the
unions about working conditions and about
a special court to deal with disputes when
there is anything to dispute about. It has
its eye on a paper-mill site, tooI—its 1 —its own
eye, not an imported one.
“N.T.”: As the inventor of the instrument
mentioned by “Arthur R.” on telegraphist’s
cramp (B. 24/10/T8), let me speak.
Mechanical transmitters for sending dots
only have been in use for years, but the
making of a continuity of dashes has caused
thousands to quit. I have produced such a
machine, and it has passed a test by experts.
It has been in use for 12 months without a
single adjustment, and will send a group of
figures with only 18 movements of the fin-
gers, against 37 on an ordinary machine and
50 by keys. As regards cramp, I know of
telegraphists, almost nervous wrecks, still
sound as senders after 25 years; and.of men,
splendid specimens physically, with useless
arms—the diagnosis is most baffling. Per-
sonally I think the primary cause is trying to
work above one’s natural speed. The effort
begets fatigue, the brain refuses to synchro-
nise with the movements of the hand, and the
nervous system finishes the job. I would
advise all senders, key or machine, to use as
light a resistance-spring as possible, and to
leave the body absolutely relaxed (either
sending or receiving). This conserves the
nerve force and keeps an operator fresh.
There was a case in America where a
“broken-down” sender had his arm scientifi-
cally broken by a doctor, who reset it and
registered a cure. The Department is alive
to the trouble •in Australia, and provides
mechanical transmitters for those in need of
them,

The Woollen Undershirt.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WENT to school with Ned—and now
he’s killed !
Poor Ned, with his weak chest! His
precious chest!
The fuss his mother made about his lungs!
His father had just puttered on through life,
And then just petered out. And that was
why
Ned’s mother was convinced that he would
make „ ,
Famous the name his father failed to do.
Most mothers dream these silly dreams, 1
know; . , , , ,
But poor old fumbling Ned, with that weak
chest — , ~ , -
What did his mother think she d make ot
him ?
When we left school, I found him, just a
clerk ;
And still the hopeless plodder, dull as ink.
It worried him, his mother’s splendid
dreams.
I think she’d got his future on her brain.
I’ve heard him speak, though not with bit-
terness,
Of all the glorious things he’d got to do.
He was to be Prime Minister, at least!
He Used to swear; and then he’d break off
short,
Apologising for his mother’s dreams.
“But, what’s the use? I’ll always be a
fool!”
Then came the war —and now old Ned is
killed!
When he enlisted I was not surprised.
It seemed the sort of thing that Ned would
do.
He didn’t rush it; but he felt he ought.
His mother made no sign. It must have cost
Her night! of agony to give it up—
Her vast ambition for her stodgy son.
She kept her head up as she always did,
And doubtless dreamed of General Ned, V.C.
And knitted great ambitions into socks; _
And saw that Ned wore on his precious
chest
An extra undervest of thickest wool.
So Ned marched off and disappeared from
sight.
Then after three years’ fighting got his
stripe.
His mother said his chest was holding out,
Was even- growing stronger, though he wore
A newly-knitted woollen undervest.
And nothing now would stop his great career
When he returned. And then the awful
news!
Her Ned was killed! His mother took it
well,
Head up, and hidden tears, but with a
pained
And puzzled wonder. How could he be dead
Like that —just killed—and there was his
career,
Before it started, smashed! To her it
seemed
Unfair, oh, horribly unfair! Her boy
With those strong lungs of his....like that
to die!
Then came the splendid story of his death,
Surprising to us ;all, but not to her—
You can’t surprise a mother. When the line
Hung back before a Hun machine-gun hid,
It was old Ned wffio sensed the thing to do,
And did it in thait quiet way of his.
“We’ll creep upon the beggar from the flank !”
The sergeant said. “Who’s coming?” And
the men
Crept after him. They knew that some
would die;
But with some luck they’d “out” the wary
Hun.
Old Ned hung back. “He’s done up,” said
his mate.
But when the party on the gunner’s flank
Prepared for their wild rush against that
hose
Of bullets, Ned sprang up, with arms out-
stretched,
And rushed the Hun! The beggar couldn’t
miss,
But he was rattled. Ned had banked on that.
He went ten yards before Fritz got his aim ;
Then straight into Ned’s chest the bullets
sprayed.
And then with arms outstretched he crumpled
up.
The German’s grin was smashed when half-
way through
By seven bombs. The cost was really cheap :
Only one digger killed, instead of ten.
“The fool, to rush him on his own like that!”
The sergeant swore, and bent above the dead.
“The fool! The glorious fool!” He wiped
his eyes.
For Ned was armed with nothing, not a
bomb.
And so within his woollen-vested chest—
His precious chest his mother coddled so —
He gathered all the bullets for his mates.
You should have seen his mother then!
Career?
What fame could equal Ned’s? Prime Min-
ister?
No politician ever died like that.
I tried to tell her of my grief for Ned.
To pity her for all her dreams gone wrong,
She smiled her inward smile that shut me
out.
And afterwards, when she’d forgiven me,
She showed me jealously her treasure-trove,
The only relic of her son’s career,
A knitted woollen undershirt of Ned’s,
That she confessed she often wished to
darn—
It was so frayed and torn with bullet-holes.
N.s.w.

Spurious Imitations.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Brokenbust was young and
wrote to please himself, he was very,
very conscientious, and everything
that appeared above his signature was well
and truly done. Teh years after he had
exulted in private ove/r his first printed story
Brokenbust was wijiting to appease his
weekly creditors, andl his readers (readers
never take these things into account) occa-
sionally said in a judicial way that some of
Herbert Brokenbust’s latter work was not as
good as his early stuff. In that middle period
Brokenbust was satisfied if a thing didn’t
actually disgrace him so long as he was
decently paid for it. In his third and last
stage Brokenbust was a cynical hack-writer
in poor health who had forgotten that he had
ever written for the joy of the thing. Praise
of his earlier and better work merely made
him say savage things about the wretchedly
small sums he had got for it, and whenever
vague tales were told him of how posturing-
fools were using his name in remote places
to gain praise, beer or shelter, he merely
laughed and hoped his name would be worth
more to them than it had ever been to him.
But one day while musing in a bar (he did
all his later musing in bars) he had an idea.
“I’ll make money out of these idiots!” he
exclaimed. “If it’s worth anything to them to
impersonate me, I’ll give them formal per-
mission to do it and present them with
some points—for a fee.” Then he had his
fourth beer, borrowed writing materials from
the barmaid and drafted an advertisement,
which duly appeared next day in several
papers. It ran :
TO LOVERS OP AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE.
Mr. Herbert Brokenbust, the famous Australian
writer (author of many poems, short stories,
articles, etc.), is always glad to meet those fellow-
Australians who are sufficiently interested in him to
advertise him personally throughout Australia.
Mr. Brokenbust’s name is an open sesame to
cultured Australian Society anywhere.
Particulars on application,
Box , G.P.O.
He didn’t have to wait long for his first
client. As it happened, one of his most con-
sistent impersonators—a wretched, callow
youth with sandy hair and foolish goggling
eyes—was in Sydney when the advertisement
appeared, and being desperately curious about
the man whose best work he had fathered in
many a simple assembly, took his courage in
both hands and went along to see his idol.
Brokenbust managed to receive the ass
with sufficient ease to reassure him some-
what ; but when under some skilful cross-
questioning he admitted that his admiration
for Brokenbust’s work had driven him to
pose as the author, the literary giant started
gently to chide him.
“But, my dear Mister Toodle, when you
come to look back, don’t you think it was
rather a dangerous thing to do?”
Mr. Toodle blushingly admitted that it was.
“And —er —just a little unfair to me?”
“Yes, perhaps it was.” He was very sorry.
“Oh, don’t worry about that now! But
suppose, for instance, that I myself had
turned up at that particular place just when
you were—nr —enjoying any little celeb-
rity I may have won? That would have been
very awkward for both of us?”
“Yes, indeed it would.” He was very sorry
again.
“Don’t trouble at all, Mr. Toodle! Or
suppose someone who knew me—some offi-
cious friend—had arrived and denounced
you as an impostor (a thing I would never
have dreamed of doing myself, mind you!),
how awkward that would have been !”
“Oh, yes, indeed it would.”
“Quite so! Now, my dear Toodle” —this
very sternly—“can it be possible that you
still do a little posing for the fun of the
thing, you know—no harm meant at all? I
shan’t mind a bit if you say ‘Yes!’ We old
literary men are too wise to resent the best
sort of advertisement we can get, so don’t be
bashful!”
Being thus greatly cheered and encouraged
the foolish Toodle made open confession. Yes,
he freely admitted that he was in the habit of
posing as the great Herbert Brokenbust, and
it had earned him the esteem of many people
who would otherwise have ignored him. He
would rather be able to write like Mr.
Brokenbust than have £50,000 a year. He
thought that everything Mr. Brokenbust had
ever written was “simply grand.”
“Thank you, my dear chap !” said the great
author with a bitter smile. Then, with a
brisk return of his business manner: “Now,
Mr. Toodle, I want to make a proposition to
you. Let us put this thing on a business
basis. You get a certain amount of applause
and entertainment but no money by using
my name; but you have no authority to do it,
and you are liable to have things made
unpleasant for you at any time by someone
who knows me. An upset of that kind
wouldn’t do you any good or me either; and
yet, by pretending to be me for a little while
you don’t do me or yourself any harm!
See?”.
Toodle “saw” with a wan smile of doubt.
“Well, now! Suppose you pay me a fee—
just a nominal fee, you know—for a written
order authorising you to adopt my name
when and where you please? That will fully
protect you in case of your identity being
challenged ; and, in addition, I will give you
some useful tips about the sort of stories to
tell, how to answer people, and perhaps a
bit of original unpublished verse in my
characteristic style to put in autograph-books.
It will help you to do the thing really well,
you know, and save you from looking fool-
ish. Do you follow me?”
“Yes, yes ; it is a jolly vood idea!”
“Well, now, about the fee? Do you think
you could manage a couple of guineas, eh?”
“Oh, yes !”
“Right you are, old man! Now, if you've
got the cash—thanks, thanks very much!
Don’t want a receipt? No! Right-o*! Now, if
you’ve got half an hour to spare we’ll have
a drink and a yarn and I’ll put you wise to
a whole lot of things you ought to know!”
Of course the open-mouthed Toodle had
the requisite half-hour, and old Brokenbust,
like the good sport he was, filled him up
with valuable tips. It wasn’t wholly un-
selfish aid, for he wanted his impossible
double to do him as much credit as he could.
Next day Toodle, who was a sort of junior
country traveller for a softgoods firm, went
forth into the back country as a chartered
impostor.
Before he’d been gone a week Brokenbust
had a couple more liars in active training
and a country friend of Toodle’s taking a
postal course. The idea had caught on. It
wasn’t long before Brokenbust’s few pet edi-
tors began to wonder why his supplies of
copy were getting so infrequent. Then
Brokenbust thought it was time to raise his
fee, and did so. The number of rolled-gold

Backache! Why?
Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do you feel that you are
getting old? Having made up your mind that you are a martyr, do you
vent your ill-humor on the family? After a while, the pain and stiffness
leave you, a,nd you forget your troubles until the next morning, when
the same dull pain in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing
your nerves, brings back all the dire forebodings of the day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim, and you are
starting on a long journey towards ill-health and infirmity. The
Kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleansing out the impurities
from your blood. Each day there is an accumulation of waste which
must upset the body. It forms Uric Acid, and Uric Acid is the most
insidious form of poisoning that can take place in your body. The
number of ills to which it leads is almost limitless, and though middle
age is the most favorable season for their activity, even the youngest
child often suffers, and sometimes dies from the different manifestations
of Kidney Trouble.
A change of diet is an advisable precaution, but a reliable, specially-
prepared remedy for Kidney Trouble, such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, is
the safeguard for your health. Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills stimulate your
sluggish kidneys to reaction, and assist the work of removing impurities
from your blood, which the kidneys have been unable to accomplish
unassisted. Then their tonic action so revives the kidneys that are
filtering the blood that the work is done automatically as by a perfect
machine. Your back straightens up, the pulling, dragging feeling
gradually leaves you; in the morning you can leap from bed, feeling a
glow of health and vigor, and meet life with a smiling face. It is the
duty of every man, not only to himself, but to the world at large, to keep
his health in the proper condition for his daily task ; and for the victim
of Kidney Trouble Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills give just the little boost
his organs need to make them his slave, instead of his being a slave to
ill-health.
Gin Pills Will Help You.
If you suffer Pains in your Back or Sides, or have any signs
of Kidney Trouble or Rheumatism, such as puffy swellings under the
eyes or in the feet or ankles; if you are Nervous, Tired and Run Down,
or bothered with Urinary Disorders, Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache
and Kidney Trouble are the Remedy which will quickly relieve you of
your misery. You can secure an original bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s Gin
Pills for Backache and Kidney Troubles from all Chemists and Store-
keepers for 1/6; or, in larger bottles, holding more than twice the
quantity, for 2/6; or, if not obtainable locally, will be sent post free on
receipt of price in postal notes or stamps by the

Brokenbusts in training immediately jumped
from 20 to 40— 40 at four guineas apiece!
Brokenbust began to realise that his name
and fame, to the building of which he had
given the best years of his life, were worth
real money.
But of course there was a flaw in the sys-
tem, and it developed just about the time
the 75th graduate in literary and artistic
impersonation put his license in his pocket
and set sail for the bush. The absurd
Toodle (he had by this time become a per-
sonal friend of Brokenbust’s and suspected
himself of sharing some of Brokenbust’s
genius) wrote in and reported that the leisure
hours of his last trip had been completely
spoiled by running against another licensed
Brokenbust, who had declined to stand
aside even for the first graduate of the sys-
tem. Toodle, who was an eminently practi-
cal young man, suggested that each imitator
or disciple be allowed a certain defined terri-
tory for himself, and that all licenses
issued up to that date be called in and
endorsed by Brokenbust. If two graduates
wanted the same district it would be put up
to auction, the winner to be guaranteed the
ownership of it for a certain fixed term, at
the end of which it would be available for
anyone who was willing to outbid the owner.
That was only one of the money-making com-
plications he suggested. There were fourteen
others.
Brokenbust was sufficient of a business
man to see that the introduction of compe-
tition and transfer fees meant more money for
him, and he adopted the idea eagerly. Being
a person of careless literary habits, he should
also have adopted Toodle to run it for him ;
but he didn’t. By this time Brokenbust was
making so much money that he was getting
greedy.
The allotment of districts was done on a
generously unbusiness-like scale, and by the
time the 90th graduate went out Brokenbust
found he had cut up the whole State. After
a prolonged examination of the ruled map
covered with names he came to a characteris-
tic decision.
“Oh, these runs are too big! I’ll put two
men on each —they’re not likely to meet!”
Which was an ostrich-like way of not see-
ing a fatal error.
The very first of the second flight of im-
postors who went out (his license was for
Block 27, “being all that territory bounded
by the and railway lines and the
Sniper River”) was found posing and re-
citing in a pub by the rightful impostor on
the second night out, and was brutally
assaulted before he could produce his second
mortgage. When he did produce it, the
original lunatic tore it in halves and threw
it out of the window.
Then the original., fake came down to town
and commenced an action at law against
Brokenbust, while the swagman who had
picked up the torn license and repaired it
was arrested for being found by night with-
out lawful excuse, and bigamy. He was
charged with both crimes in the name of
Herbert Brokenbust. As he vigorously pro-
tested that he wasn’t the man, the terri-
torial Brokenbust who had committed the
assault was arrested. To make matters
worse a storekeeper who held a Brokenbust
license in another part of the State, and
was wanted for arson, absconded, and the
call going out to all police-stations, there
were within 24 hours 14 Brokenbusts under
lock and key—and more expected.
Brokenbust—the scared original Broken-
bust—read these things in the paper and
realised that it was Time To Get Out.
Late that night he dropped the official
marked map from the stern of a tramp
steamer outward bound for South America.
KODAK.
The Pointer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Pointer shoved himself into a cor-
ner of the shady blanket lean-to and
asked for a fag and then for a match.
We called him the Pointer because he had
mastered the art of dodging fatigues, or any
other unpleasant circumstance that called
on a man’s comfort and energy.
To climb up to those artificial terraces on
Steel’s Post, Gallipoli, by the aid of a dang-
ling rope, and baulked by a sandy foothold,
with a dixie of boiling stew; certainly called
for an effort; and the Pointer had always
eluded the job.
“Who’s mess-orderly _ to-day, digger?
asked a physical undersize in grit.
“Dunno,” answered someone, “but you’ve
done mor’n your whack, anyhow.”
The No.' 1 looked up from his nap hand,
fished out a dirty pocket-book, and told off
Darkie Ross and the Pointer as mess-order-
lies. . -
“Blime,” growled the Pointer, “ain’t I jist
bin down to the beach for the Old Man with
3, letter ! ,J
“Perhaps you have,” said the No. 1; “and
also, perhaps, you had a swim and got a
chance to pinch some flour and sugar at the
same time. Anyhow, it’s up to you for
mess-orderly to-day.”
There was silence for some time, broken
only by “I’ll go three.” “Orright, Ginger;
four fer mine.” “Git ’em,” and the flip of
cards. t .
The Pointer glanced over at Splinter, who
had opened the subject, jerked his head
towards the opening, walked out, and the
thin-shanked youngster followed.
“Bet the Pointer sidesteps mess-orderly,’
challenged Solly Black. Solly would wager
on “Beachy Bill’s” exact position, or the
date of the arrival of reinforcements.
Darkie Ross eased a lump of sun-baked
clay from under his hip, and scratched at
his" cholera belt with remarkable energy.
“Well,” he said, “’e can’t get Splinter to
take it on agen, any’ow. Splinter bet me ’is
stand-to shift agenst my l-to-3 to-night that
he wouldn’t let the Pointer pole on ’im agen.”
About midday, when the flies are appa-
rently reinforced by generations of ancestors,
descendants and all their other relations as
if aware of the proximity of food, sundry
grimy-faced, shirtless, putteeless, bronzed
men in short pants reluctantly began to
move from the shade of the waterproof
sheets and blankets. Someone called out,
“Cornin’ down, Fat? Bring yer water-
bottle. Might git it filled on the quiet from
the cart.”
“Hey! Where’s the Pointer?" yelled
Darkie Boss.
The Splinter lurched along the ledge, step-
ping over feet poking ont from the sun-
shades, dodging lengths of string or "wire
that held up the lean-to uprights of rifle,
pick or shovel. Coming to Darkie he said,
“I’m goin’ down fer the scran. The Pointer
fixed it with me.’’
Ross looked at him thoughtfully a moment
and grunted, “Well, gorblime, you’re a mug,
you are. That bloke could git you to swap
a tin of milk fer a tin uv plum ’n’ apple.
Wot’s he givin’ yer fer takin’ it on?’’
The Splinter’s eyes shifted from Darkie
to a length of cord tangled round his boot.
A voice near by roared out, “Carn’t yer look
where yer goin’? Strike me lucky, some er
yous blokes wants the bleedin’ earth.’’ The
cord was the mainstay of the objector’s
home, and the place was in danger of being
dismantled. Splinter unwound himself,
glanced again at Ross, and started on down
the incline of 70 degrees.
Half-way back with their loads of tea and
stew, sweating and blowing with the heat
and strain, cursing the flies that were as
persistent at every meal-time as Johnny
Turk’s 10-pounders, the mess-orderlies
paused for a spell.
Darkie broached the subject of the
Pointer again.
“It’s this way, Dark,’’ said the Splinter.
“I ’eard that a beach party of 100 are to
go down ter-morrer night to unload barges.
I’m on the list of the mob from our platoon,
and I swapped jobs with the Pointer. ’E
kids ’imself that in the dark ’e’ll be able ter
smother up amongst the cases and make a
sorft thing of it. P’r’aps ’e can, but any’ow
Beachy Bill got my brother, and I’m dead
frightened of that blarsted gun.”
Ross took a cigarette butt from behind
his ear, and after inhaling a cloud of smoke,
handed it to the Splinter.
“Well,” he said, “you didn’t seem to be a
jellyfish down at Cape Helles, ’n’ Beachy
ain’t in the same street as that go.”
“That was different. A bloke was ’oppin’
along amongst ’is cobbers, and it was ’ot
stuff all the time; but that cow Beachy
don’t say nothin’ till ’e’s there>. Besides” —
They gripped the two dixiles, grit their
teeth, caught the rope, heaved themselves up
a bit, let go and caught the rope again
every foot or so until the ledges were reached.
Men scrambled out of the shade and
shuffled towards the dixies, forming a queue
as they came. No one grumbled at short-
weight stew, but each man eyed his dole of
tea with suspicion. The regular fault-finder
spoke for all, so no one else bothered.
“Pity that greasy cow at the cook-’ouse
didn’ ’ave ter eat this stew! I reckon we
ought ter roar ’em up about this muck. ’lm
and ’is two off-siders ’ad fried steak fer
breakfast. Fried steak, mind yer!”
Next evening, about dusk, the n.c.o. in
charge of the beach fatigue got his party
together and called the roll.
A stray bullet from the “Chessboard,” a
Turkish position on the left front and over-
looking one small area of the ledges, was
responsible for a casualty before the party
moved off. Word was quickly passed for
another man to fill the place, and the Splin-
ter fell in, actually and metaphorically.
A march of a couple of miles through
Shrapnel Gully, through winding communi-
cation trenches, brought the men to the
beach. The night was now pitch dark. The
only lights showing were in the hospital
clearing stations, a twinkle here and there
from staff sandbag shelters and dugouts, a
few dull boat-lamps rocking with the swell,
lanterns flitting amongst the laden barges,
now being swarmed over by the unloading
party, and, a few hundred yards out, the
bright red crosses and green bars of a couple
of hospital ships.
The n.c.o. had his work cut out to keep a
steady stream of men passing from barge to
dump, and he soon began to miss faces. A
walk amongst the scattered heaps of cases
and fodder invariably brought to light a few
shirkers and genuinely tired men. The
Pointer had lumped a case of meat over the
100 yards or so of beach in the first hour,
and the Splinter had struggled through 20
trips. He was dead-beat when the Pointer
stopped him and suggested “a break.”
“Lumme, Splinter; turn it up! You’re
makin’ it too ’ot. Come and ’ave a spell
under a tarpolin I’ve jerried to.”
“Believe I will fer a bit. Them blarsted
cases must be near a ’undredweight.”
The two sneaked through the shadows
until they came to a dump of pressed lucerne
covered with tarpaulins. Creeping under
cover they sat down. The Splinter’s breath-
ing soon became normal, and he sprawled
back with a sigh of relief.
“D’ you know, cobber,” presently he said,
“a man might cop one from Beachy frum
this side?”
“Yes.” answered the Pointer, “an’ he
might bump inter three or four near the
barges. You’re all right ’ere, cock.”
After 15 minutes had passed the Splinter
decided to return to work. “I’ll give it an-
other go,” he said. “We got ter finish before
daylight. Are yer cornin’ along?”
“Not fer mine, lad. I ain’t so fond of
yakker as you seem to be.”
Just about the breaking of dawn Beachy
Bill sent along part of his daily contribu-
tion. There were four shells in quick suc-
cession. They came every day, at any old
time. Always somebody got a crack of some
description. When Beachy spoke it meant
comedy or tragedy.
Utterly fagged out, the beach party got
back to their mates on the ledges. Roll-call
did not matter now the job was done. The
Splinter flung himself down under a propped-
up blanket and immediately fell asleep.
Breakfast did not trouble him.
,About 10 o’clock Darkie Ross awakened
him. “ ’Ere, show a leg Splinter,” he said.
“Why didn’ yer tell us that the Pointer was
outed ?”
“What! The Pointer killed ! Gorstruth,
I didn’ know. W’en did it ’appen?”
“Why,” said Ross, “ ’e must ha’ copped
last night. They found ’im near a fodder
dump. One of Beachy’s shell’s ripped a big
’ole in the tarpolin and the Pointer was
lyin’ ’arf in and ’arf ou,t of it. Must ha’
bin passin’ at ther time.”
“Glad I didn’ do no dinkum pointin’ last
night,” muttered the Splinter to himself.

RIPPED HIS ARM WITH BARBED WIRE.
Throbbing, Poisoned Wound that other treatments failed to Cure.
Mr M Hill of 16 Windmell Street, New Farm, Brisbane, says: “While getting through a
barbed-wire fence I badly ripped open my forearm. The wound festered In the opening, the
edges of which yawned apart, matter filled in and my arm inflamed in a terrible manner. The
pain was awful, for the wound would throb and throb, making it nigh unbearable. Although I
used many remedies I did not get any relief. .. .. ~
“After seven months a friend persuaded me to try Zam-Buk. A ftcr the flrst application the
inflammation was drawn out and the wound cleansed of all impurities. I persevered with Zam-
Zuk until the injury healed up in a splendid manner.” 1/6 and 3/6 a pot, everywhere.

REFRIGERATING AND

While the Greatest Selling factor in our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN RUNNlNG—which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts 'a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.” Their strong-
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of your
plant, not oniy to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
an initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your service.
