"That Seal Guarantees Congoleum Quality,
11 says the salesman, pointing
to it on the rug.
Announcement.
IN offering their goods to
the Australian public the
Congoleum Co. do so with
pleasure and confidence. The
success already achieved in all
other parts of the English-
speaking world demonstrate
the vital necessity for these
lines, which have proved won-
derful sellers. The wholesalers
and retailers of Australia have
fine stocks, which may be in-
spected to-day by the econo-
mical hoiisewife. If your store-
keeper cannot supply you with
Congoleum Gold Seal Art-
Rugs and Floor Coverings, write
to the agents requesting a
rug chart, which shows the full
line in actual colors. Also
there are cover folders illus-
trating the other Congoleum
floor coverings. Specify prefer-
ence when writing.
Congoleum Art-Rugs have
solved one of the housekeeper’s big-
gest problems by providing attractive,
durable, easy-to-clean Rugs at low cost.
THEY come in a variety of choice exclu-
sive designs in soft, artistic colors.
They may be had in various sizes and
patterns suitable for any room in the home
where a moderate-priced, serviceable floor-
covering is needed.
The firm, smooth surface of Congoleum
prevents dirt or dust from getting down into
the rug, and makes it positively sanitary and
easy to clqan. A hasty going-over with a
damp mop is all that is necessary.
It is a great convenience, too, that
Congoleum Art-Rugs do not “kick-up”
under foot nor curl at the edges', but always
lie perfectly flat without fastening.

Une Sam as Historian
The United States has become a great
supplier of historical books, and they are in
the main of a high order. A new one is
Fifty Years of Europe, 1810-191 T, by Pro-
fessor C. D. Hazen, of Columbia University.
It is well written, in remarkable contrast
to the leaden output of Ludendorff and his
class, very accurate, well supplied with
maps, and conspicuous for its fairness.
The section dealing with the recent war
is, of course, the most attractive, especially
where it treats of the making of revolutions.
Trotsky might as well have been Juddsky,
a man with a chronic habit of being at or
near the bottom of the poll, for all the
visible chance he had of attaining power by
a popular vote. It was a mere handful of
bribed sailors who were sent to chase away
the Russian Parliament and arrest the
people’s Ministers at the end of 1917; and
the nation looked on because it was mostly
far away, and its leaders were scattered,
and by reason of the Juddsky party having
snatched control of the telegraphs, Gov-
ernment offices and principal newspapers it
didn’t really know what was happening. By
the time it knew the small armed minority
was sitting on its head. Being utterly unaccus-
tomed to organisation and self-government,
and being, moreover, used to having its
head sat on, it allowed the minority people
to remain. They took the place of the old
Grand Dukes. The new men disbanded the
army lest it should prove dangerous; it was
already so demoralised by peace propaganda
of the Perth Labor Conference sort that it
readily dropped its rifle and went home.
Being the last word in incapacity, the con-
spirators didn’t even keep a semblance of
the old force together to overawe the Hun
during the peace negotiations, so in four
nionths the llim took from Russia 500,000
square miles of territory, more than one-
third of its population, about 73 per cent,
of its coal and iron, 37 per cent, of its
manufactures and almost evei*y yard of its
European sea-coast. Even the One Big
Union couldn’t have made a worse mess of
things. It would have been a noble addi-
tion to the Hun’s dominions if the war
hadn’t miscarried and he might have come
back for more. In addition he demanded all
the visible coin and securities by way of
indemnity. It was as easy as robbing a
caterpillar.
. Professor Hazen utterly repudiates the
idea that the Hun started his last campaign
t-Mareh, 1318) with a premonition of evil.
Russia and Rumania were broken. Serbia,
Montenegro and Belgium were occupied and
all but finished. The U.S. troops had hardly
begun to arrive, and had hardly begun to
be troops. “The prize of victory,” said the
elated senior partner of tin? firm of Me and
Gott, “will not fail us,” and the Financial
Secretary told the Reichstag in April that
the indemnity would be so colossal that
they hadn’t even begun to imagine the
amount. It was then that the Allies aban-
doned the disastrous policy of divided com-
mand and made their supreme soldier, Foch,
military dictator in the field. In 112 days
the Hun was in retreat with his tail drag-
ging behind him and making a furrow in
the dust. But he was the same old brother
to the last. Even when the game was up
and the plea of military necessity was de-
funct and further destruction could only
aggravate the indemnity, and when time was
precious, the retreating army utterly wiped
out 300 towns and villages, which is one
reason why France didn’t appreciate the
moral platitudes of Woodrow Wilson about
not bearing too hard on a crushed fellow-
Constiaiv. The U.S. person has a long memory
himself. It was at least 60 years before he
left off cursing .T. Bull because the British
burned the public buildings fno more) of
M ashington in 1814. If a millionth part of
what happened in France had befallen Uncle
Sams country, Uncle would probably have
shifted Berlin and Potsdam with German
prison labor and thrown them bodily into
the sea to poison the fish. (Bell and Sons,
Ltd., London.)
Victor Horsley, Surgeon
Out of the voluminous material submitted
to him, Stephen Paget has evolved an excellent
biography of one of the best-known sur-
geons in London these 30 years—a surgeon
whose death in Mesopotamia was one of
the crimes of the war, since there was no
necessity whatever to send such a specialist
at such an age (he was in his GOth year)
to such an inferno. Horsley’s place was' at
the head of some gfeat hospital devoted to
brain and nei-ve injuries, in either France
or London, and not pottering about amid
stinking mud and flies and every conceivable
inconvenience and torment. But he was
not a persona grata with the Government
and the further away he was the better
Authority was pleased. He was first con-
nected with a private hospital at Wimmereux,
the 21st General Hospital not being readv,
and when it was ready it was ordered to
Egypt. He was in Egypt from June, 1915,
to March,. 1916, and in that month he went
to India, and from India to Mesopotamia.
Incidentally he praised the Australian Hos-
pital at Wimmereux; “they are very good up
there, and have got their place on a strict
military footing,” he wrote.
It is the little intimate details of a great
London surgeon’s life that will most interest
the general reader, who will be unwilling
to flounder along amidst the mazes of ex-
perimental physiology and the technique of
brain and nerve surgery; he cannot be sup-
posed to follow closely the experiments on
the localisation of cerebral function, or the
rabies experiments, or be impressed by the
fact that a disease known as myxoedema fol-
lows extirpation of the thyroid gland.
Horsley’s pioneer work in brain surgery be-
gan at Queen’s Square on 1886. The patient,
a Scotchman aged 22, had been run over
when he was seven, and while in the wards
for observation he had 2870 fits in a fort-
night. Horsley removed the brain scar and
some of the surrounding brain tissue, and
the fits stopped. By the end of 1886 he
had done ten operations on the brain with
nine recoveries, and was fairly launched on
liis great career. He afterwards enriched
British surgery by perfecting the operation
for spasmodic wry-neck,' which he said was
the most difficult of all operations, and also
foTlnd a way to remove the Gasserian gang-
lion for trigeminal neuralgia, as well as
being the first to remove a growth from
the spinal cord. Visitors from all parts of
the world came to see him operate at Queen’s
Square, and foreigners began to regard him
as a demigod. If you happened to know
Horsley when abroad every thing was made
smooth for you, and the best of cheer and
the most interesting cases were put at your
disposal at once. There is an illustration
in the biography showing the great man at
work at Queen’s Square. Professor Ivocher,
of Berne, perhaps the greatest surgeon in
the world, is looking on, and there is a sus-
picious bulging of Horsley’s figure. He is
wearing a sterilised pad over the right
iliac region on account of having to undergo
the operation for appendicitis on the mor-
row, and instead of resting he is doing an
operation for brain tumor. That was char-
acteristic of the man; he was entirely self-
less.
It has been suggested that Horsley would
have accomplished more had he kept to the
strict path of science and not dabbled in
medical politics, and this is probably true.
It was an unfortunate thing that the pro-
fession and he had not been on the best of
terms for some years prior to the war. His
methods of achieving medical reform were
quite different from those of men who had
been steeped in tradition, who hid their
light under a bushel, did good by stealth
and were morbidly desirous of keeping their
names out of print. Horsley, on the other
hand, by his militant methods furnished
some of the best “copy” in London to a
hungry press. Most of his desired reforms,
such as female suffrage* the notification of
V.D. and the necessity of a Minister of
Health, have become accomplished facts, so
possibly his way of doing things was the
correct way, after all. Towards the end he
incurred the odium of the profession over
the passing of the Insurance Act. All his
days he had battled for the profession—
overworked, underpaid, put-upon and ill-
organised—but in the end his work went for
nothing, and he was branded as a traitor by
the very men whom he had served so well.
Wherein again the profession illustrated
that, along with much that is noble, it has
an uncharitableness that passeth under-
standing.
(Sir Victor Horsley, by Stephen Paget:
Constable; through the Australasian Pub-
lishing Co.)
L.G.D.
Shaw
Unfairness, inconsistency, illogicalness and
sundry other sins could be charged against
Hilary Lofting on the evidence in “The Gym-
nastics of G. 8.5.” (Bed Page, 22/l/’2O),
but his worst crime is unoriginality.- Hav-
ing nothing- new to say of Shaw, he says
the things that unimportant people have
been saying ever since the publication of
“Gommonsense About the War.” After
being at pains to represent Shaw as an arro
gant bounder who has “murdered the quality
of humility,” Mr. Lofting next pictures him
apologising “anxiously and tearfully” to him-
self for not being an artist. He trots out
the stock gag that Shaw has said that he
is “a better dramatist than Skakspeare,” as
though this alleged statement had only to
be quoted to die of its own absurdity. .What
G.B.S. argues is that the dramatists of to-
day have a definite advantage over those ot
the sixteenth century, and he put his case
with illuminating brevity when he an-
nounced : “Shakspeare is a much taller man
than I, but I stand on his shoulders.”
Lofting appears to resent Shaw’s liking
for Jaeger underclothing in much the same
manner as London pork-butchers and stock-
brokers, with more reason, resented Wilde’s
fondness for lilies and greenery-yallery
effects. But whereas Wilde’s eccentricities
served to win him notoriety (and a good
deal of undeserved appreciation) as a writer,
Shaw’s soft collars and underclothing be-
came famous because he happened to wear
them ; just as good Queen Victoria’s alleged
habit of taking meat bones in her fingers
was given widespread publicity because it
happened to belong to a person about whom
any personal details were considered in-
teresting by the newspaper-reading public.
Mr. Lofting asserts that “fifteen years ago
anyone would have believed the truth of
Shaw’s possible greatness; but not now. The
noise of the cackle and the clamor will not
die down in time.” In effect', ILL. argues
that G.B.S.’s faults, real or imaginary (and
many real ones may be acknowledged), as
journalist, critic, politician and in other
equally unimportant capacities destroy his
claim to greatness as an artist. Shaw’s
wonderful intellectual energy has caused him
to storm many citadels, and the fact that
he has not captured them all does not de-
tract from the fiierit of his victories, any
more than Napoleon’s defeat by an inferior
soldier at Waterloo can obliterate his mili-
tary greatness. Shaw may be a second-rate
critic, a fifth-rate politician and a tenth-
rate patriot, but his greatness as a drama-
tist and a humorist was established long
before he wrote “Commonsense About the
War.” It is as ridiculous to argue that
‘Shaw the dramatist has been ‘done in’ by
Shaw the publicity expert” as it would be
to assert that Wells the novelist has been
killed by Wells the theologian of “God the
Invisible King.” Lofting admits that Shaw
has been gorgeously funny all over Europe.”
has written “screamingly funny plavs” (a
feat which has entitled Sheridan to imrrfor-
tality, though as a politician he ceased to
be of importance while still alive), hasi“a
miraculous gift of dramatic characterisa-
tion,” has revealed “tender, natural beauty”
in one play, “poetry and clear vision” in
another, has “a magnificent mind.... as
vivid and strong as a poet’s,” and yet, be-
cause he wears Jaeger underclothing,' writes
occasionally tiresome prefaces, and revealed
“tactlessness about England and the war”
at a time _ when most writers were busily
(and, admittedly, more usefully) employed
being as tactful as possible in the interests
of patriotism, he no longer deserves to be
thought great in the field in which he is most
entitled to consideration. Lofting writes as
though lo years ago Shaw was just be-
ginning to show signs that he might one day
achieve greatness, but further back than this
he had already written “Mrs. Warren’s Pro-
fession, Candida,” “Arms and the Man.”
Man and Superman,” “You Never Can

M ohammed
and the Kodak
Once upon a time the mountain refused to come to
Mohammed, and so Mohammed went to the mountain.
Very, very frequently the pictpre refuses to come to the
amateur, and so the amateur goes to the picture.
It is the kind of picture that you have to go to get that
emphasises a characteristic of the entire Kodak line the
extreme compactness consistent with the size of the
picture the instrument makes. Kodaks are as big as they
ought to be for results —they are as small as they ought
to be for convenience. If the mountain won t come to
your Kodak, you and your Kodak can go to the mountain.
But there are times when the larger Kodaks take up just
a little more space than there is to go round. This* fact
might constitute a problem were it not for the Vest
Pocket Kodak.
There is always room for the V.P.K. It is so small that
you can wear it; so good that it will do just what its big
brothers will do, only on a smaller scale —even to the
autographic record containing the date and abbreviated
title beneath the negative they describe.
A Photographic equipment without a Vest Pocket Auto-
graphic Kodak is incomplete.
And the price, too, is small, only 47/6.

For Constipation
Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been
expelled from the body are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettes, the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do; and
they do not wear out in their effects.
Taken according to directions they
assist the patient so that the use of
an opening medicine is not a con-
stant necessity.

Between the great standing trees
Making a spider-web ferry.

The Theme.
Afar fi*om the war of weary words
And cares that tire and teem,
Out of the music of singing birds
I got me a golden theme;
No man may find in the whole wide world
A sweeter theme, in truth ;
It told of joy, like a flower unfurled,
In the morning light of youth.
I said, “I will take that happy song
And make it all my own ;
Fine it will be to thrill the throng
Where men in the shadows groan.”
I said, ‘‘l’ll kindle a warming fire
For hearts grown cold and grey;
For more than gold does the world desire
As it shivers on its way.”
And there in the shade of a green gumtree
I hearken joy’s own notes.
Lending my ear to the melody
That gushed fxxxm the feathered throats ;
The birds sang loud in the leafy mass,
I saw them, singing, sway;
But vain, all vain was my task, ala’s,
For I could not feel as they.
The air was athrill with shine and shade,
Buf there I saw pale Grief—
Grief in the flower and Grief on the blade,
And Grief on the dancing leaf;
Where lilies blow and the roses stai't,
There thorns and thistles grow;
Song that is hued by the human heart
Has ever tears to show.
For always and ever there came a groan
That put my tune awi\y,
Ever and ever I h§ard the moan
Of beautiful things that die;
If only the flowers were shining words,
Ard life pulsed free of w T rong.
Out of the music of morning birds
I would fashion that sweet song.

I did not think that grey and green could
meet
With such a dusky radiance, coldly sweet,
In the twin mirrors of your smiling eyes,
That glass—l know not what! Two pretty
lies?
And then the warm, white roundness of your
throat —-
The charming voice sinks on a mellow note
Of what you do not feel. The dusky brown,
The Grecian knot of hair, coiled low a-down
On the smooth neck; the pi*etty, black-
browed fi’own :
Then the ci’eam folding of your netted gown
That ends at girlish ankles, clad in white;
Two grey-green eyes that laugh a child's
delight;
And as I watch you gliding through the
night.
Those shining eyes, holding such gay par-
lance
With all you pass and step with in the
dance,
Enchain all minds, a minute at the least.
I sense, nor see, the slowly bi'ight’ning East
That ushers in the day to swamp the stars,
And. dizzy, standing by the window bars.
I wish your smiling eyes wei-e placid blue,
Held less of all you see, and less of you :
Told not so many lies, and less of truth.
Were not so dark with age, so sweet with
youth;
Were not so ignorant, or not so wise—
Ah, child ! your faithful, frowning, trait’rous
eyes,
Your darkly laughing eyes of deep green
grey,
Smiling on others, smile my heart away!

WHEN THE COMMUNITY GOES ON
STRIKE.
The question becomes urgent whether pas-
sive resistance in industrial matters isn’t
overdone. Passive resistance seldom, per-
haps never, won a war, and if the community
does nothing save hunger-strike against
strikers it is possible that it may hunger
a long time. The history and geography
of an average industrial upheaval nowadays
are simple enough. A body of men refuses
to use the methods of law and stops the sup-
ply of some necessaries of life in the hope
that the want of them may make the com-
munity and its wife and infant so wretched
that they will surrender if they happen, in
their State capacity, to be the employer, or
will do the strikers’ work for them without
pay by bringing pressure to bear on private
employers. 'lt is in part the simple device
of coercing people by torturing the children;
partly the Hun policy of taking hostages;
partly the other Hun device of putting the
civil population in front to draw the enemy’s
fire ; and altogether it is a violent form of
conscription. The community is forbidden
by threats to do for itself what the strikers
refuse to do, and the community’s property
(railways, etc.) is seized or laid under an
interdict so that the owners may not use it
for their own purposes. And according to
the ethics of the game, as defined and laid
down by the party which creates the trouble,
it is disgraceful ard unheard of for the com-
munity to do anything but hunger strike in
return —anything but leave off eating. It is
also in the etiquette of the business for the
community to lend its posts, telegraphs,
trains, steamers, banking arrangements, etc.,
for the collection of funds and supplies from
unionists not on strike for the benefit of
strikers, and as the average man must be a
unionist to live this means that pressure
can be brought to bear by the . consent of
the community on a vast section ot the
community to support the _ hold-up ot the
whole community. And it is. in order that
the community should lend its law courts
for the prosecution, by union officials, ot
dissatisfied compulsory unionists who tail to
pay their contribution for the support of the
Bolshevik strike paper.
In the days when Labor had never been
in office to make wise laws that would render
strikes unnecessary—in the days before
Arbitration Courts were devised, largely by
Labor in office, and when the strike was
the workman’s only weapon—a great many
things were Reasonable that aren’t reason-
able now, and almost anything was excus-
able. But Labor has had a turn at office
in every State. It has owned six out of
the last 11 Federal Ministries. It had six
years of office in N. S. Wales, and more
than half of the present Ministers were
elected as Labor men. It is in its fifth
year in Queensland, and in the two States
where it has been most in office (N.S.W.
and Queensland), the strike trouble is worst.
Labor, having made its own State arbitra-
tion laws where such laws are least re-
spected. and having had six Ministries to
make its Federal arbitration laws, can’t
say that strikes are necessary any longer —
at any rate, it can’t say that they are more
necessary than ever before —unless it enters
the plea that it and its chosen leaders are
wholly incapable of legislating and manag-
ing public affairs. Certainly one other plea
is possible—that it likes violence, and enjoys
human suffering and is filled with a ferocious
satisfaction in showing the possession of
power after the manner of the school bully ;
also that it gets things by sudden violent
upheavals and coercion and industrial bri-
gandage that it is ashamed to take by
statute. Briefly, it can thus plead two
things—(J) incapacity to legislate and
govern; (2) plain wickedness. Whichever
it be the community will inevitably, unless
things improve, organise the counter-strike
on a grand scale sooner or later. The
methods which Irvine adopted in the matter
of the Victorian railway stoppage in 1003
were outrageous, for in those days the
nearest approach to arbitration was a series
of futile schemes for voluntary discussion
if both parties fejt amiable, and if they felt
so amiable as all that there was no trouble.
The strike was practically the only alter-
native to complete submission. In 1020
Irvine’s methods would in most cases be
justifiable. Active resistance couldn’t make
things worse than the passive method has
done. If banking institutions of all sorts
were forbidden to hold the accounts of
unions which refuse arbitration, or to trans-
mit money for their support, and if the
postal department carried neither their let-
ters nor their literature, and the railways
refused to carry their literature or goods
or their agents, and if Parliament cancelled
the right to enforce subscriptions to their
papers, and also cancelled the voting fran-
chise of anti-arbitration strikers, it might
look a big thing. Yet if this and more was
done it would only mean that the commun-
ity had itself gone on strike, under severe
provocation, in defence of the laws which in
most cases Labor itself has made. The
community has a better right to hold up the
railways, banks and post offices which it
owns, against a small aggressive band of
strikers who defy the law, than a small
aggressive band of law-breakers has to hold
up the railways, of which it owns but the
smallest fraction, against the whole body
of proprietors. Remittances to support an
anti-arbitration strike can quite as logically
be declared “black” as beer or any other
substance.
* * * *
A point which makes it necessary for the
community to give up mere passive resist-
ance is that the strike —when the partial
strike or darg or go-slow is included —is
now in a majority of cases not so much an
effort to gain better wages and better con-
ditions as to reduce production. Better
wages, unless they are spent on liquor or
two-up or backing the wrong horse, should
mean better houses, better gardens, more
presentable towns, higher education and
greater ambition. Reduced production means
more dependence on imports and on im-
porters and foreign profiteers; higher prices,
for the monopolist who commands the mar-
ket and is out of reach of local laws puts
no limit on his exactions; higher cost of
living; more row about the higher cost of
living; more strikes for still higher wages
to counterbalance the higher cost of living,
these being generally combined with demands
for still shorter hours and still less produc-
tion ; and a steady sliding downhill towards
anarchy. The theory of the new Bolshevik
variety of Labor leader is that six hours’
work at 3s. 4d. is the same as eight hours
at 2s. 6d., for they both mean £l. The other
fact is that there is seldom any effort to
crowd more work into the hour—sometimes
less is crowded in—and six pairs of pants
or boots or six hats ; nstead of eight means
that the foreign profiteer improves his hold
on the market by 25 per cent., and gaily
uses the new leverage to raise his charges
30 per cent. To quote the record for one
recent week only, massive increases were
announced in imported hats, paper, silk
(prices doubled as compared with August),
men’s clothing materials (it was announced
that the suit might go up another 20 or
25 per cent.), tobacco, cigars and linseed.
The last is a simple, necessary article made
from flax, whidh is one of the easiest things
to grow, but isn’t much dealt with here for
want of linen factories to encourage the
business. Australia depends for linseed
largely on ugly vellow men in Manchuria,
and they having become nasty, and the Aus-
tralian being helpless unless he gets a hold
on the More Work gospel, the Necessary
Commodities Control Commission put up the
price 25 per cent. In rare cases the slow-
ing down takes place in some unmanageable
article like bricks, and then the result isn’t
increased importers’ profits, but house
famine and lack of the decencies of life.
PROHIBITED GOODS.
The question of the prohibition of cotton
imports from the United States becomes a
matter of consideration in Britain. It is
mentioned among possibilities. Cotton is
the raw material of the Cold Country’s big-
gest industry, and the imports of it are far
greater than those of any other article. The
exports of finished cotton goods are also
greater than those of anything else. The
United States furnishes about four-fifths of
the raw material, and the rest comes mostly
from Egypt. Though Australia has great
areas of cotton land, neither the pressure
of war nor the offer of high prices could
drag the Australian from his old groove of
wheat, wool and meat. The prohibition of
TJ.S. cotton would bring calamity on Bri-
tain, yet it is being discussed as an alter-
native' to worse calamity. The danger that
threatens is from the foreign-debt curse.
Britain, for the first time since the disas-
trous pre-Elizabethan days, when the Hanse
Towns had a mortgage on the world, is
deeply in foreign debt. It borrowed abroad
under the tremendous stress of a war in
which it spent per inhabitant twice as much
as Australia did. It has been going further
in debt since because it had to keep up
armies in the Armistice time, because of
the cost of repatriation, and because it had
turned its factories into munition works,
and they required reconstruction. The In-
ternational Court of Circumstances passes
this short and sudden sentence in such
cases: —•
one nation is deeply in debt to another, and
wants to renew the loan or to get new loans in the
shape of money or railway material or cotton or
anything else on tick ; and
When the creditor nation won’t lend more, and no
other lender can be found (as in the present extra-
ordinary case, where the U.S. is the only country
with any appreciable amount of spare coin on earth),
Then the value of the currency of the country
which is in debt goes down so that when the
Englishman buys an article from the U.S. marked at
£1 in the catalogue he pays about £1 10s., and the
German, being much worse off, pays £l2.
So J. Bull has begun to talk of meeting
the disaster that comes of being in foreign
debt by ceasing to buy cotton, seeing that
the purchase only adds to the debt, and he
talks of .doing this even at the cost of great
domestic trouble.
♦ * # *
The question at once arises : What imports
is the Commonwealth going to prohibit '! For
our purblind policy of short hours, poor in-
dustries, enormous imports, strikes, new
loans and renewal loans, paper money and
boom holds up only by the grace of J. Bull in
London ; and J. Bull, through his misfortune
rather than his fault, is near the point at which
he will hang on only by the grace of step-
brother Jonathan in New York. The latter,
not being a part of the family, but merely a
business acquaintance, is under no particular
obligation to show grace. His Government
won’t interfere and Private Enterprise is
out strictly for dollars. There are obviously
many imported articles that we can do with-
out a thousand times more easily than Britain
can do without raw cotton. And it is very
obvious that it is up to us to move first,
for our debts to J. Bull are now Bull’s
debts to New York at second hand. If pres-
sure becomes a shade worse on the Old
Man in London, he not only must cease to
make advances, but must call in the debts
owing to him as they fall due —in other
words, refuse to renew our loans and ask
for the cash on the date mentioned in the
bond, on which date it has never yet been
ready. Apart from a great increase of pro-
duction, the only way to stop the accumu-
lation of debt and to make some prepara-
tion for the future is to buy less, seeing that
so much of the buying is paid for with
I O U’s. And the person from whom it is
most imperative to cease -buying is the one
who demands cash, or rather the thing
we are now reduced to calling cash, at the
rate of something approaching 30s. in the
f. The fact that this person is also the
Supreme Creditor makes it still more im-
portant not to get further into his debt.
But the cutting down of imports should
cover many lines besides his.
When the Federal Parliament meets it
should get to work instantly on this question,
it being a time for short measures. To begin
with a prohibtion might be issued against
the importation of railway material except
(1) for purposes of repair; and (2) where
it is wanted, not for the mere extension of
a line, but to fill in a gap in an unfinished
work which, by reason of the gap, is made
an unpayable proposition. Even then the
permit should not be granted unless there is
overwhelming evidence that the goods can’t
be produced locally. In fact, there ought
to be a general shutting down on huge, ill-
digested schemes based on loans and importa-
tions, and they should wait till local
materials and local money are available.
Meanwhile the suspension of many public
works would release a lot of labor for pro-
ductive industry. Among other lines, con-
fectionery has already been put on the pro-
hibited list and should be kept there. Other
foreign goods that might be dispensed with
in a time of stress —and this is a time of
stress —include feathers, carpets, galvanised
iron, playing cards, jewellery, perfumery,
fireworks, patent medicines, soap, furniture,
monumental marble, locks, velvets, cigarettes,
some varieties of liquor, bicycles and sports
goods of all sorts. Many other things, such
as tobacco and matches, might be prohibited
on the instalment plan, the quantity allowed
to enter the country being reduced by degrees
to allow time for local industry to grow. It
might be a case of leading the homespun life,
but the homespun life is coming, anyway. If
it comes of its own disorderly volition, by
the lack of loans and of money to pay for
imports, then the famine will happen in
medici? s and surgical instruments and tools
of trade just as violently as in perfumery
and feathers and cigarettes. In fact, by
some malevolent chance the supply of neces-
saries for the sick might give out first, while
films and gramophones and tennis and foot-
ball goods might be the last articles to stop. It
is best to prepare for the inevitable instead
of waiting till it comes on big untidy feet
and does unreasoning smash; for the unfore-
seen and unprepared-for scarcity is a blind
sort of animal, striking out at all and sun-
dry, and with no more manners than a
gorilla. The story of the besieged city where
food gave out but wine and face-paint and
perfumed hair wash were still abundant is
one of the commonplaces of history.
AN ATTEMPT TO APPLY A WAR
MEASURE TO PEACE CONDITIONS.
The Bulletin received by the last London
mail documents setting out the “Aims and
Objects of the British Society for the Pre-
vention of Venereal Disease.” The large
committee-list contains a couple of dozen
world-famous medical names— Frederick
Treves, William Lister, Alfred D. Fripp,
("the late) William Osler. and the like;
Sir James Cbichton-Beowne and Sir Wil-
liam Lane are the treasurers; and other
offices are held by men such as Kipling and
Ray Lankester. England only embarked
in any real sense on the open discussion of
the V.D. menace during the war; and it
says a great deal for the public spirit of
private citizens that so much priceless ven-
tilation work has been performed in the time."
Without the co-operation on such lines of
prominent medical men in private practice,
no Government can effectively tackle this
or any other sort of plague. The new Bri-
tish Society goes as far, probably, in the
way of constructive effort as is practicable
in the present half-formed state of British
sentiment; but that is no great distance.
Its immediate “aims and objects’’ boil down
to instructing the public in the use of pro-
phylactics and supplying the same. Pro-
phylaxis, no doubt, did wonderful service
during the war. Sir Akciidall Reid re-
marked in the New Statesman (1/11/Tit)
that in 1916 he was in charge of 2000 troops
stationed in a large seaport. He introduced
prophylactics. “Immediately venereal dis-
ease vanished from my units. During the
first five months I had not a single case. In
two years and four months seven cases
occurred. By the same methods Surgeon-
Commander Boyden achieved with sailors
results which were, if anything, even better.”
This is not surprising when it is remembered
that the medical authorities of the American
Army by the issue of prophylactic packets
to every platoon and section reduced V.I).
to one case in a thousand men. But many
methods which are suitable under war condi-
tions are futile in peace. At the front and
in camps the padre or the man with the
padre mind was more or less a cipher. All
things, ethical considerations included, were
subordinated to the necessity of providing
the ever-thinning battle-line with healthy
men. But the fighting had hardly stopped
when the Archbishop of Canterbury, speak-
ing in the House of Lords to a proposal by
Lord Willoughby de Broke that the Gov-
ernment should "utilise our recently-acquired
knowledge with regard to disinfection,” said:
“The question of immorality cannot be over-
looked, and we shall but increase the ten-
dency to sin by providing safeguards against
its effects.” It is thus all in accordance
with precedent that the designs of the
S.P.V.D., which is largely a medical and
scientific organisation, should be fiercely
opposed by another body—the National
Council for the Control of Venereal Disease
—which is largely religious and feminist.
The prophylactic system was a success in
all the armies, just as it had proved a suc-
cess in a small way in the British Navy
long before the war,. for the reason chiefly
that compulsion was the essence of it. But
no one can compel a civilian to receive a
prophylactic packet or dock his income and
immure him in a barb-wire compound should
he become diseased. It would be extraordin-
arily difficult for a Government, and quite
impossible for a private organisation, to
supply prophylactics, as required, to a nation
or even to a State or a citv. Nor would
any Government take on the tremendous
contract in view of the howl of disapproval
the step would be certain to elicit from those
who hold with a sort of lex talionis for the
sinner—in this case that his children should
be blind, mad or degenerate because he
“fell” before marriage and was unfortunate.
Bodies such as the S.P.V.D. tend, therefore,
to balance the good they do in the way of
saving individuals here and there by occa-
sioning a certain amount of harm. There
are no more delicate problems, from the
point of view of a Government which wants
to stay in power, than those associated with
the control of V.D. Says Sir Archdall
Reld :—•
Half the population of this country (Britain)—
not half the male population, but about 20,000,000
living and dying people—have suffered from venereal
disease.
To the average lay man or woman these
figures will seem ' incredible. There was
horrified amazement recently at the dis-
closures that a mere 55,000 members of the
A.l.h'. had suffered. That is one-sixth of a
force numbering no . children or old people,
but composed almost exclusively of youhg
and adventurous men. But the politicians
know the strength of the position, and th-fey
are correspondingly loath to move.. If pri-
vate organisations are willing to step in apd
tuke the dirty work of coping with the V.D.
problem off the Government’s hands, who
is the Government that it should object?
And if medical experts are active, why
should the Government duplicate their efforts
or enter into competition with them? That
is the attitude liable to be adopted by many
Governments in deference to the formidable
V.D. vote; and it is undesirable that there
should be even the shadow of an excuse for it.
So that, on the whole, it would be wild
optimism to expect prophylactics to do for
civilians a sizeable fraction of the service
they did for the soldiers. Let their use be
encouraged by all means. Every chemist
shoulo stock them ; and if a devoted body of
distinguished medical, scientific and literary
men got together here, as they have in Eng-
land, they might do much to induce the
chemists to sell and the public to buy. But
it would only represent a mild palliative at
the best: so mild, and as regards the mass
of the population so ineffective, that since
the politicians mivht use it as an excuse to
shirk their bounden duty, it were perhaps
better left alone. What is the first need
in a community such as ours —a community
which lives for the most part on a seaboard,
and which is in for a record rush of immi-
grants as soon as shipping conditions allow
of it? Obviously that foreign agents of
venereal infection should be excluded. A
mitigating feature of the venereal horror is
that it is quickly and easily identifiable in
all its forms. Very few would get through
the medical barrage, provided the Federal
Government had the moral courage to put it
down at the Quarantine Stations of the dif-
ferent ports. The next requirement is that
all the States should possess V.D. Acts, and
that all of them should take such legislation
seriously. At present V.D. legislation is
only operative in four of the States. As an
indication of the farcical lines en which the
different Acts are administered, it was lately
put on record that while just on 11,000 in-
fections had been notified all over the Com-
monwealth, not one communicator of any
form of disease had been prosecuted. The
tally of those who have been secured for
treatment, but have wandered off uncured
to infect others, already runs into thousands.
Poor administrative machinery is probably


to blame for this rather than slackness on
the part of the doctors. And, finally, if
venereal disease is ever to be absolutely
eradicated from Australia, if this country is
to take its stand proudly one day as the
only clean continent on earth —and that
splendid ambition is perfectly practicable,
given the necessary courage and resolution —
then the nation will have to swallow some
form of supervision of prostitution. All
prostitutes suffer at some time, while 25 per
cent, are suffering all the time. They are
by no means the only breeding-ground of
venereal disease ; but under the British sys-
tem they are easily the chief ground. In pre-
war Paris, under supervision, 7 per cent, of
the cases were infected by prostitutes; in
free London 73 per cent. Given the con-
ditions enumerated above, and within a de-
cade there should be no need for prophy-
laxis. And that is the real goal to aim at.
SHOULD WE HANG THE KAISER?
Ik the question had been put 18 months
ago there would have been a unani-
mous shout of “Certainly!” And similarly if
the same query had been put in reference to
Tirpitz, Ludendorff, Hindenburg, the
Crown Prince and scores of others. Nations
always feel that way during great wars:
it is only in comparatively recent times that
they have desisted from executing their de-
feated enemies’ captains and kings without
so much as the form of a preliminary in-
vestigation.
The feeling was overwhelmingly strong
against the Kaiser owing to the wide-
spread conviction that, hateful though
he might be, he was yet great and pro-
portionately dangerous. He personified the
embattled might of the German Empire
in the minds of apprehensive millions, as
Napoleon once personified France and
Frederick Prussia. So powerful was the
sentiment in England that his surrender and
trial were the first items on the peace-terms
list drawn up by the Lloyd George Govern-
ment early in 1918. Towards the end of
the year the mighty German Empire sud-
denly blew up and collapsed. Its alleged
author and main inspiration bolted like a
welshing bookmaker, and was next heard of
as a refugee in the home of a reluctant
Dutch squire. Journalists and others pushed
their way into the presence and emerged
with pictures of a peevish old civilian des-
troying his host’s trees in an embittered
spirit for the benefit of his digestion, and
taking little or no interest in anything else.
No caged yet still indomitable eagle in Elba,
this; rather a demoralised insolvent, well
content to loaf on the modest annuity bought
for, him by the family. As though to put
the finishing touch on the downfall of a
splendid tradition, the London Morning
Post began the publication of his letters.
The evident intention of the great Jingo
daily was to stimulate the Government to
act up to its original threats. The effect
has been to present the one-time Menace as
a person who, throughout his career, was a
futile, muddling busybody; a dabbler in
petty tricks such as that of sending an
iigent “disguised as a coal-owner” aboard
British ships to listen to the conversation
of the officers ; a mildly vindictive gossip of
the sort that figures at any old woman’s tea
party. Not the Evil One disguised to look
like a great ruler, as many had fearfully
pictured him ; but rather Mrs. Gamp in the
uniform of a Potsdam Guardsman.
There could be only one advantage to
the world from the formal trial and execu-
tion of such,a preposterous figure. That is
the establishment of the precedent that in
all future wars those who are to blame shall
be punished. Under such a system kings,
presidents, prime ministers and even mem-
bers of Cabinets might be a good deal more
chary about sentencing millions to death
than they are at present, when such an act
means safety at the worst and immense
personal prestige and aggrandisement at the
best. But, to be logical, all those even re-
motely responsible for the carnage should be
called on to face the judicial music when it
ended. There might then be unexpected re-
actions. Almost anybody in a prominent
position can be arguably held blamable for
a great war provided the records are
searched with sufficient diligence. The
Kaiser appears, from his letters, to attribute
the late horror to Edward VII. Edward
made the Entente possible. France would
not have fought without it. Therefore the
slaughter is on Edward’s soul. On this
reasoning Lord Grey of Fallodon could be
shown to be also the man. He presided when
the Treaty of London was made after the
First Balkan War in 1912. Fie fixed the Enos-
Midia line as the frontier between Turkey and
Bulgaria. Turkey crossed the Enos-Midia
line when the Second Balkan War began,
and Grey did not enforce his own Treaty.
It made the Bulgars pro-German, and satis-
fied the Germans that Downing-street was
afraid to fight. In short Grey’s weakness
encouraged the Hun to undertake the Great
War, and so he should hang! This exer-
cise might be extended to include practically
everv prominent character in Europe. It
is all a matter of the point of view. Hardly
a single general on a losing side would be
safe; and hundreds of battalion com-
manders, camp commandants and so on would
be in grave peril.
Of course the execution of a thousand
Kaisers would not be too much to pay
if it impelled the world’s rulers to think
hard before they embarked again on the
smallest of wars. But would the like-
lihood of death, if they failed, cause them
to take fewer chances in the way of fomeot-
ing wars, or would it simply make them
more ruthless and persistent once a war
had started? The teachings of history sug-
gest the latter.
The strongest argument from the British
standpoint in favor of letting the sleeping
Hohenzollern animal lie is the fact that it
is impossible for England, the home of
modern justice, to give him a fair trial.
His case has been sub judice for months, if
not years, and during all that time it has
been discussed and he has been condemned
daily. The legal view is expressed in a cable
of last week, which mentioned that the ex-
Kniscr is complaining bitterly of the publica-
tion of his letters. He says that it is
“contrary to all justice,” and is seeking legal
aid to prevent their publication in Ger-
many. Suppose there is a case for the
defence, as the law of England always begins
bv presuming. What chance will the ac-
cused have of presenting it? Every witness
who might help him is particeps criminis,
from Betiimann-Holwegg down to the
humblest submarine specialist. They could
only enter the jurisdiction at the risk of
their lives or liberty; and if they were dis-
posed to appear their evidence would be
looked on as tainted. Even if it were possible to
give him a fair trial it would not be politic
to- let him get off. In fact, it would be un-
thinkable. The French, who are true haters
—as the British are not and never have been
—and who are exceedingly suspicious, would
not forgive such a development; and they
would be unable to understand it except on
the basis that someone had been squared.
The alternative is that he should be con-
victed right or wrong, and condemned to the
one penalty adequate in the circumstances.
But the American Peace terms, as set out
by Senator Lodge, senior Republican mem-
ber of the U.S. Foreign Relations Commit-
tee, do not include the trial of the Kaiser ;
and the Democrats are strongly against such
proceedings being taken, and always have
been. America has done splendidly out of
the war, having removed momentarily from
England its financial, commercial and indus-
trial supremacy. Following on a more or
less farcical trial, and a repetition of the
Whitehall tragedy of 2J centuries ago,
America would be in a position to add to
its other trophies England’s title to the most
nearly incorruptible Bench in existence. The
distinction would accrue by default, so to
speak; the corruption being no less real
because the agency responsible was not hard
cash but political considerations. And,
finally, the newly-born German Republic,
with which the Empire has just concluded
peace, has a right to some sort of considera-
tion. “Do Frenchmen and Englishmen,”
asked Vorwarts a few days ago, “wish to
play into the reactionaries’ hands and help
the pan-Germans? The extradition ques-
tion will play a great part in the coming
general election as a weapon against the
present Government.” The llohenzollern
family has fallen .so low in the last year or
more that nothing on earth can save it but
martyrdom. If the Kaiser is able to cut
anything like a good figure before the Eng-
lish judges, he will put them in an odious
position even in the eyes of Britishers, who
have a sporting sympathy with the under-
dog, however disreputable he may be. In
Germany it would inevitably pave the way
for a revival of monarchism, which is the
last thing desirable in the interests of the
world’s peace.
Taking the situation by and large, it may,
as things have turned out, be best to leave
the old mountebank to wrestle with his
manifold ailments in peace. Diving he is
dead: hanged he might live again as a really
remarkable engine of disruption and misery.

The Trouble Proportional Representa-
tion May Get us into.
Proportional representation is to be tried
at the N. S. Wales General Election in a
month or two, and naturally and properly a
dozen or more parties are lining up, as well
as candidates who are their own parties—
Laborites, Nationalists, Soldiers and Citi-
zens, Progressives, Socialists, Democrats and
others. For the first time in the history of
N. S. Wales a big, forceful man will have a
chance, though still not a fair chance, even
if he doesn’t make a hypocrite of himself and
pretend to agree with a cellar-full of small
political bosses. But . unless something else
is done half or more than half the possible
gains of the new system will not be realised.
The big, forceful man who does his own
thinking .may be able to get a place in the
House; but he still won’t be able to get a
place in a Ministry, even though he be the
most capable business man in the country.
In fact, the new system, unless it is sup-
plemented by elective Ministries, may mean
poorer administration than ever. With only
two parties in the House everybody who ean
get into Parliament is at any rate in one
party or the other, so that in the swing of
politics everybody has a chance of showing
his quality as an administrator within a few
years; and a Prime Minister can draw his
colleagues from more than half the House.
But under proportional representation it
may easily happen that no one party will
constitute one-third of the House. If all
the talents of all the parties were drawn upon
there would be none too much for the proper
administration of the affairs of the country;
but with the choice of Ministers cut down
to less perhaps than a third of the members,
it is certain that inefficients will be appointed.
Ministers have so much to do that they
should not be in the House at all. Moreover,
their job for the most part calls for qualities
which are little likely to appeal to the elector
in a popular vote. One can hardly conceive
a great financier, for instance, making much
of a success in a hot election campaign. The
office-cleaner or lift-man would probably beat
the general manager of any bank or great
insurance office of Australia in a contest for
an average Assembly seat. The selection of
Ministers from outside Parliament, as is
done in the United States, would give the
country the benefit of the services of men
who, no matter how great their qualifications
as Ministers, have no hope or at any rate no
inclination to win a popular election. Pend-
ing the introduction of that system, it is
urgent that proportional voting in the con-
stituencies shall be followed by either pro-
portional voting for the election of Ministers,
or their election on purely non-party lines.

Unhanged Enemies of the People.
Melbourne, Thursday.—The future policy of the
Labor party was discussed at a special meeting of
the Trades Hall'Council to-night. A resolution Was
moved affirming the object of the industrial move-
ment and pointing out that the end in view was
the overthrow of the capitalistic system by
Revolutionary Action. .. .The debate was adjourned.
—Perfectly dispassionate item in recent daily paper.
Like many other assemblages of the sort it
was t 1 " mildest-looking gang of pirates that
ever cut a throat, and when people talk that
way it is difficult to know whether they are
brigands or poor play-actors. But they cer-
tainly profess to be brigands, and as some of
them must be what they appear, it would be
safest to take the advocates of “revolutionary
action” at their own value. There is a
large criminal and potentially criminal class
in every community:—homicides, thieves,
persons of lecherous instincts, brutal-assault
hoodlums and others. Also there are cranks
who, if they are taught long enough that re-
volution, with the murders and other horrors
that follow in its wake, is, or imVy be. a duty
and a virtue and a fine democratic proceeding,
are liable to commit almost any atrocity.
Even thuggism can be made a holy thing. It
took Australia over 120 years to acquire a
National Government system in which all
men and women are equal regardless of
birth, wealth or rank. Though the powers
of that Government may be less wide than
they might be, they can be extended in-
definitely by a vote in which again all men
and women are equal- They would have
been largely extended only the other day had
not the Labor leaders declared against the
extension and in favor of keeping certain
powers in the hands of State Legislatures
with nominee or restricted-franchise Upper
Houses. The people have enjoyed their
national political freedom for only 19
years, and already a brigand crowd of
would-be Kaisers and potential mur-
derers. or people who profess to be
potential murderers, propose openly to
take it away from them, and these folk are
neither imprisoned nor hanged for their
treason. If the treason-mongers were a
majority—the majority which has a right to
rule—they could carry their proposals in the
House of Representatives, anyhow, and make
them known, and could demand, and win, a
referendum on them if the composition of the
Senate, which is also a House of manhood
and womanhood suffrage, though with a diff-
erence, made any difficulty. That is
to say, they could do that if they know what
are the exact proposals they propose to re-
volushe about. Almost certainly they don't
know. The idea is that an armed minority
—the minority which can’t get control of the
Representatives or carry a Referendum—
should usurp the people’s throne by force like
any other princely or autocratic or plebeian
ruffian or ruffians, and hold it; then
decide what to do next. There would
be a lot of killing in the process of ‘‘revolu-
tionary action,” a lot of theft and arson,
and probably much rape, torture and mutila-
tion, for Revolution Day is every criminal’s
chance, and the futile men of the Trades
Hall don’t look like the hardened military
leaders who could keep a mob. or rather 2000
separate mobs, in hand. Having secured the
power, which an armed minority, even a
small one, can generally do, the policy which
isn’t submitted to the Representatives now
because it doesn’t exist, would develop. That
is to say, it would sl'de downwards from one
horror to another. It is always a safe and
a wise policy for a Government which stands
for All the Peoole not to underrate its
enemy, but to arrest, and send for trial on
the capital charge of high treason, the people
who talk revolution, seeing that it can only
mean the stealing of the people’s rights and
liberties with unmentionable horrors thrown
in. Rebellion against the government of an
autocrat or a ruling aristocracy or oligarchy
is loyalty to the people. Rebellion against
the rule of the people is a crime so heinous
that there should be a death sentence for it,
and the advocacy of it is only a shade less
infamous. These folk who discuss and advo-
cate “revolutionary action” and familiarise
the rising generation with the idea of it so
that they cease to realise its monstrous
iniquity, may plead, when it comes to an issue,
that they were only talk.v fools who meant
nothing. But they are supposed to be grown
men who mean something—not children or
lunatics.

Queensland’s Railways.
Queensland Minister Fiiielly has been
shedding big globular tears over his unparal-
leled railway deficit. It was largely, he said,
through having too many employees, and that
was a legacy from the late Government. If
the present Tiieopore-Fihelly combine pro-
poses to shelter itself behind the Ryan-
Tjieodore-Fihelly combine, which it re-
cently replaced, and which worked with the
same policy and the same caucus, and talked
with the same jaw and even mostly wore
the same clothes, the plea is too thin. If, on
the other hand, the Denham Ministry is
meant- —the one before Labor —the tale is
too thick. Denham quitted office in June.
1015, bequeathing to Ryan, Theodore and
Fiiielly 10,689 railway employees—22l per
100 miles of line to be worked. By 191 S the
new gang, in its feverish desire to find easy
jobs for its friends or somebody, had 14,341
employees—27l per 100 miles, though the
traffic to be handled was much less. (Figures
on this point are to June. 191.8, and the posi-
tion has become worse since then.) During
the war time other railway managements,
run by people who were moderately sane and
quite anti-Hun, economised to some extent.
They didn’t want to put men in the places
of those who had gone to the war and load
the railways with superfluous workers when
the war men came back. Nor, when the war
had made labor scarce, did they want to take
the remaining men away from the factories
and the farms and turn them into public
servants. They preferred to ask the em-
ployees who left to do more work, and pos-
sibly get more pay. So N. S. Wales, Vic-
toria. S. Aus., Westralia and Tasmania,
which among them had 78,390 employees
when war broke out in 1914, were struggling
along with 71,496 at June, 1918, a reduc-
tion _of 0594. Queensland showed an increase
of 3538. Denham in his final year reduced
the number of employees by 114; and then
Ryan and Theodore and Fiiielly increased
them in three years by 3652. DeNtiam
went on the two simple principles followed
by the other State Premiers— Holman,
Peake. Earle, Peacock and Scaddan; that
the billets of the railway men who went
to the war must be kept open, and that
when so many workers were withdrawn
those who were left must work harder or
various jobs must be cut out. Ryan. Theo-
dore and Fiiielly, instead, filled the space
left by the railway men who had enlisted—
filled it three times over, with the prospect
that it would be filled a fourth time when
the original employees returned. They
reckoned that the period of labor scarcity
was a fitting time to put on three men to
do two men’s work. Thus they kept up their
pose as lavish paymasters, easy-going em-
ployers and jolly good fellows. Because
50,000 Queenslanders (Minister Fiiielly’s
figures) had gone to the war and left the
country short of workers, the three chiefs
took inside three years another 3G52 off the
labor market to work on imaginary but high-
paid jobs. There were three notable results:
(1) Production fell off so much for want of
producers that the quantity of goods carried
on the railways, despite a great increase of
railway mileage, uropped by 935,000 tons in
two years, while the other States combined
showed an increase of nearly a million tons.
(2) \\ ith so many men away, and Ryan,
Theodore and Fiiielly offering high wages
and easy times on Government jobs to those
who remained, the few available workers
grew arrogant and spent so much of their
time on strike that Queensland was further
crippled. (3) There came as the natural
result a period of desperate loans, huge de-
ficits and multiplication of taxes, which are
now about double those of any other main-
land State per head ; and finally there came
unemployment which, in proportion to popu-
lation, also became almost double that of
any other State. It is not suggested that
Ryan and Theodore and Fiiielly did all
this because they were vicious. The proposi-
tion is merely advanced that they were
samples of a loose-mouthed class —political
boy-pirates escaped out of a political penny
dreadful; inflated brayhards reared on a
diet of words, who didn’t know enough to
know that their brand-new gospel was a
hash of rudimentary ideas that had been
tried over and over again and had failed.
They were the young men in a hurry and
not so very young either. They started out
not knowing the alphabet of public finance,
and after filling the State with disaster anil
disappointment for 44 years they are inordin-
ately proud because they have almost got up
to B.
A System Under Which the Sheep Lead
the Lions.
Tiie S. M. Herald had something to say
last week upon a scandalous aspect of the
Defence situation:—
There are in our “permanent forces,” for one
good military reason or another, many officers who
(through no fault of their own) have not had fighf-
ing experience. This is inevitable. Hut what is
not inevitable, and is galling in the extreme, to a.
number of gallant and distinguished field officers, is
that cases are multiplying of returned colonels or
majors, “permanent” soldiers, being forced on re-
turn to drop their commissions and to take orders
from men who were not at the front, and who are
comparatively but infants in knowledge of the real
efficiency of an army, that learned on active service.
But is it inevitable that officers who have
had no fighting experience, after a five-
years’ war in which the man-famine was
unparalleled, should hang on in the per-
manent forces? It is not, and every soldier
knows it. In a few cases those permanent
officers w'ho did not join the A.I.F. re-
frained because they were (1) genuinely
indispensable at home (a tiny class, this) or
(2) frankly unwilling to become cannon-
fodder. The greater number of those who
remained in Australia did so because they
were medically unfit. Not merely technic-
ally unfit, as were so many of the “Home
Service Gurkhas” in the English and French
base camps, but such hopeless crocks that
not even a medical friend would take the
responsibility of passing them for active
service. Now, a well-known clause in the
C.M. Regs, insists that every officer must
produce annually a certificate that he is
medically fit for active service. That fail-
ing, he must retire. Some years ago a
Bulletin man was shown over Parramatta
Gaol. He commented to the then Comp-
troller on the old age and apparent feeble-
ness of many of the warders, in view of
the predominance in the place of young and
powerful criminals. “How can I help it?”
said the Comptroller. “They retire with-
out pensions and their pay is small. All
I can do in common decency is to keep
them on and trust to luck.” An excep-
tionally kind-hearted Comptroller of Prisons
may act in this way; hut practically all
Army chiefs must. They are the lifelong
friends of those affected; and the officer-
caste feeling, far stronger in the “regular”
forces than it ever was in the A.1.F., is
another powerful factor. The result is that
the Regulations are ignored. Every barrack
and fort in the Commonwealth contains its
quota of mostly senior officers who could
not stand a week of the rigors of life in the
field, and have never seen service any-
where. They are not only physically in-
capable of performing the one service that
in the last resort they are paid to perform :
they stand in the path of those who can.
As to the “returned colonels and majors”
cited by the S. M. Herald, who have been
reverted to n.c.o.’s and even gunners and
privates—-men who have proved their compet-
ence in the severest of testing-grounds—
the plain truth is that the Australian Per-
manent forces, as at present constituted,
represent in part a sort of genteel Benevo-
lent Asylum. It is not altogether the fault
of the higher military authorities: like the
Comptroller of Prisons referred to above,
they are only human. But it is obviously
rotten bad business. And the scandal will
continue to the prejudice of efficiency, dis-
cipline and the prestige of the Army for just
so long as the Federal Government shirks
the duty of instituting a military pension
system. Pensions for retired regulars look
formidable on paperbut there is hardly a
nation in Europe that has not found them
economy in the long run.

Randolph Bedford :—
Of all the Queensland country stricken moderately
in the last drought there is none more beautiful
than that from Warwick through Yangan and Emu

The trains go westerly to the trunk-line loaded with
Yangan cheese, Emu Vale corn, coal from Tanny-

A note from one of the front-rank public
men of the IJ.S.A.: —
If Australia ever deviates from her policy of a
White Australia by the admission of colored labor
into a, semi-tropical >ftrth, merely to satisfy a few
capitalists, she will be as criminal to her future
generations as the ill-advised lazy gentlemen of the
Southern States of America who first imported
negroes from Africa, and so saddled the country'
with a Colored Question which is much harder to
solve than filling the Northern Territory with a
happy, contented and prosperous population.
You van solve your Northern Territory problem.
There seems to be no hope for our negro problem. We
have taken the poison. It has entered our system.
Your business is not to take it.
As to other things to be learned from our ex-
perience, nothing, I think, is so important as to
prevent that condition which made our entry to
the war so difficult and now threatens to make good
relations with Britain equally difficult. Much of
the German propaganda was conducted through
the Teuton press, and much damage is still being
done through a press printed in foreign languages.
Have none of that. Pass a law, before it is too
Jate, forbidding printing or public writing in any
language other than English throughout Australia
and its 'territories. ,
We are, I think, too well organised commercially
for Australia to draw wealth from America. But it
is Australia’s own fault if she does not draw
wisdom.
«.
Unless it had gone to the Bench and taken
Justice CtrssEN from Victoria, it is doubtful
whether the Commonwealth Government
could have bettered the appointment of Mr.
Starke to the High Court. As an advocate
he was clear, concise and forcible, and swift
to grasp a point. In the lower courts and
in earlier days he had a manner which did
not always find favor with the Judges. But
the High Court, at any rate, has never had
any. cause to complain; so there can be no
feeling even akin to resentment among their
Honors on that score. On the contrary, his
record as an advocate in that Court has been
so brilliant, and his knowledge of constitu-
tional law in particular is so profound, that
he is bound to receive a cordial welcome; and
if he produces the judicial temperament, he
may be confidently expected to play an im-
portant part in building up the prestige of
the Court.
“Henry Horsecollar” is still angry:—
The cable reports that “The Turk Will Fight” if
an attempt is made to take Constantinople from him.
Praise be to the pigs, also to the Prophet, only Ihe
news seems too good to be true! Our fezzed brother
was badly defeated before when he had German
officers, soldiers and artillery and the command of
the Orient railway, and when the Allies had other
work on hand and could only give him a fragment of
attention. He stepped out of the war so unobtru-
sively that quite a large section of the unlettered
and mud-hut population isn’t aware yet that they
really were licked. They have an idea that border
murdering is just partially suspended for a little and
that pogroms are still in order. Their boss Bashi-
bazouk, Enver Pasha, is fooling around in Turkes-
tan with a sort of army, planning trouble, in alliance
with the Bolsheviks, for Afghanistan, Persia and
India, and is supposed to be on a Turk reconstruction
movement. If the Turk won’t fight gratis he should
be paid to do it in order that it may be really
explained to him that he is a back number and
hasn’t simply had a temporary loss of circulation.
The war never got into the real Turk country,
which is Asia Minor, so he doesn’t know. The
German also escaped invasion, but then he read all
about it in the papers. There are hardly any Turkish
papers and the people can’t read. It is very likely
that they hardly ever receive letters except in the
capital, for the European pcst-offlces, which the
better class used surreptitiously, were mostly closed
during the war. The civilised nations insisted on
having their own post-offices in Turkdom, not because
they thought the secret service would open their
correspondence any worse than the Germans did,
but because native officials couldn’t carry letters round
the corner without losing them. They had their
own hospitals for a similar reason. The general
Turkish country practitioner operates without chloro-
form, and Turkish hospital patients crawl on all
fours into the garden to sleep at night because the
best class of bed-vermin get busy at sunset. A
people like that require a lot of explanation; in
fact, there is certain to be need for another operation
without chloroform.
“Sixo” : “Bromide” (B. 22/l/'2O) misses
the point of my growl. As every sold ter
knows, it was possible to get first-class V.JJ.
treatment at Le Havre and Bulford. The
fact that the patient was treated as a crimi-
nal is a mere side-issue; nevertheless, it pre-
vented many men who could obtain .tleat
ment elsewhere from reporting the disease.
My complaint is that when superficial symp-
toms have been overcome and the man is
discharged, he has no opportunity of getting
the further treatment necessary for coniplete
cure. With the prospect of civilian lite be-
fore him the soldier is not likely to report
ATLAS (Modern Version).
for military treatment (and, incidentally,
detention), especially as there are no out-
ward symptoms of his disorder to cause him
present inconvenience. It is the civilian
side, not the military, that is at fault; and
horribly at fault seeing that one of us is a
terrible menace to Australia.
“Country Ped” : Government Departments
are always the same. When the war had
been raging for two years' and paper was
becoming scarce and expensive Vic. Educa-
tion Department issued an edict that the
strictest economy was to be observed in the
use of official stationery. One blanket form,
measuring 26in. by 14in., was not to be used
unless it was absolutely necessary—a declar-
ation on the back of the monthly return
would be considered sufficient. But 1920
sees a reversion to the old wasteful order.
That particular form must now be used. If
there is nothing to report it is to be marked
“Nil.” This means that every month hun-
dreds of these big forms will be returned
simply marked “Nil,” and then probably
burnt. The only thing on which the Vic.
Education Department habitually economises
is its-teachers’ salaries.
“Counterpoise”: Before the boss scientists
make fools of themselves and the public over
the so-called “mystery” wireless signals from
other worlds, I’d like to remark that reliable
data on the subject can be obtained only
through the experienced wireless operator.
However eminently scientific in wireless
matters an individual may be, unless he is
an experienced operator he could hardly’ tell
the difference between a signal fiom Mars
and a signal from a ship 20 miles away. As
a professional wireless operator of many
rears' experience, I should say that the on y
wireless sounds heard whose origin cannot
be located are those known as atoosphercs
and commonly termed Xs. These
have been the greatest bugbear tne science
has had to contend with. Inequently they
are the onlv sounds it is possible to heai in
a wireless receiver, their volume drowning
all signals completely for hours at a stretch.
Evidence points to the fact that X s are
caused bv electrical discharges in the atmos-
nuere (lightning). With the present tremen-
dous ranges of wireless receivers these “X s
are almost always being heard in the receiver
in the form of dots, dashes, etc. There is no-
thing remarkable in the fact that occasion-
ally the dots and dashes form letters, such
as S (three consecutive dots), in the Morse
alphabet.
“Hamer': You hear plenty about wasted
Repat. money; but it isn’t all hung into the
gutter. One man I know had a merry time
with his deferred pav and then, stoney-
broke, thought of work. All he asked of the
Repat. was a rabbiting outfit, and he got
away with it. In a little more than eight
weeks he was establishing a milk business
with the capital that a successful raid on
Brer Babbit had given him. In another six
weeks he had worked up and sold it for
enough to buy a tobacconist's business. Now,
wanting to do a bit for home-production, and
having a pious faith that Billy Hughes will
protect local industries, he is talking of put-
ting several hundreds into a small manufac-
turing outfit. And that is not the only case
I know of.
“Field Marshal” : As the war recedes, bitter
argument arises as to the use of military
titles. The situation is new to the British
Empire, which has never before fought with
vast civilian armies; but the U.S.A. knew it
after the Civil War, and it has become more
or less chronic in Europe under conscription.
Here the whole row reduces to this; that
certain more or less prominent persons who
never fought persist in referring to them-
selves as “Colonel,” “Major,” and so forth.
But they are not benefited by it. and the real
soldiers are not damaged. The fact that
Tom ’Enley, of Drummoyne (N.S.W.),
clings to the title of Lieut.-Colonel which
was loaned to him, so to speak, while he
handled soldiers’ socks and shirts, is not
likely to worry Tom’s friend Harry Murray,
V.C., who was a pukka Lieut.-Colonel. The
real hardship, if there is any. occurs lower
down the scale. A rock-chopper or a tram-
guard can’t go after a job as Major Brown,
D. 5.0., M.C.; it may be wrong, but it is so.
A clerk or a salesman cannot press to be
addressed as Colonel when his boss or Ms
boss’s son was an undistinguished private.
It rubs the thing home too severely \Z\
if most of the employed classes ate thus de
barred (as, in effect they are), why should
the employer be differently situated"' 'The
most dignified thing for the country to do
would be to at once cut out the use of
titles which no longer have any significance,
the men who once commanded brigades and
battalions being now in charge of depart-
ments and counters and bank cashiers’ en-
closures.
‘‘Old Dealer” : The G.-G.’s £25 prize offered
for the best suite of Australian-made furni-
ture shown at the A.N.A. exhibition iti Mel-
bourne has had to be held over until next
year because none of the entries were con-
sidered worthy of the money. Typical ‘‘shop
styles” formed the bulk of the exhibits, and
any old hybrid design is nowadays regarded
as good enough for that purpose. Some of
the “period” monstrosities shown in this
city have about the same relation to their
alleged great-grandparents as a feather duster
has to a spring rooster. The exhibition of
women’s work, held here in Melbourne some
years ago, showed that there are capable de-
signers and furniture-builders at hand. Fur-
niture-makers, for the credit of their country
and the ultimate good of their own bank-
accounts, should not be above utilising craft
of the right sort, whether the brain power
that produces it be under long hair or short.
The United States, having got into its
stride, has acquired a perfect frenzy for sell-
ing everything and buying nothing so as
to increase its mortgage on the human race.
Its last year’s returns showed: Exports,
£1,400,000,000; imports, £600,000,000; bal-
ance to be paid bv the nations (at the rate
of anything up to 30s. for every pound).
£800,000,000. It is partly through every
£ we owe to the U.S. for goods being some-
thing like 30s. that prices are high. Where-
fore wild local Bolsheviks say that a strike
should be started, not a hard-work strike
against Uncle Samuel, but a loafing strike
against any little local industry they can
see so as to reduce production and make us
still more dependent on Uncle Samuel and
such people. Also, they demand shorter
hours and still less production. The com-
mercial agent whom Australia pays in the
U.S. reports that that country doesn’t want
to buy from us —only to sell to us and get a
bigger mortgage over us. In which case the
agent had better come home and do some
useful toil such as making boots.
Sydney Telegraph recently found balm
in the theory that the rejection of the refer-
endum proposals was really an oblique ex-
pression of disgust at the failure to shift the
capital to Canberra. The peopD didn’t want
to trust any more power to a Parliament at
Melbourne. It may be so, but Australia has
said “No” per referendum to 12 successive
questions since 1911, ami the “No” majority
on the extension of Federal powers was only
12,803 this time, whereas it was 259,348 at
the first time of asking. So it appears that
the longer its Parliament sits in Melbourne
the less Australia distrusts it. South Aus.
has voted “Yes” six times and “No” six
times. This time it said “No” more deci-
sively than ever before —out of disgust at the
way in which the people who barrack for
Canberra swindle it out of the railway for
which it gave solid consideration Queens-
land has now said "No” four times and “Yes”
eight times. It said “Yes” with unusual
energv this time, possibly because it liked
the Parliament being in Melbourne and
hated the idea of having it any closer. The
Canberra party can find proof of a popular
yearning for that site in any vote that is
taken about anything except Canberra. What
they ne\er propose is to take a referendum
on "the plain question whether Canberra is
desired or not.
It looks as though Isaacs, J., and Rich, J.,
of the High Court, who furnished the minor-
ity judgment in the McCawley case, are
going to be told that they were right.
McCawley, an officer of the Queensland
Law Department, was appointed President
of the State’s Arbitration Court: and the
validity of the appointment was denied by
the High Court —a majority judgment.
McCawley, backed by the Government,
appealed to the Privy Council; and the Privy
Council “reserved judgment without calling
on Sir John Simon (for appellant) to reply.
Which looks like an easy win for the appel-
lant. Bitterness was imported to the pro-
ceedings even in London; counsel for tne
other side pleaded for “a little more indul-
gence” than usual, on account of the feel-
ing in Australia.” Such an application
made on such a ground seems to h a Y e v(^ r - v
properly' shocked the court. What the plea
amounted to was this: “The people, thiough
their constitutionally-appointed Ministers,
have done certain things. W 7 e disapprove ot
them. Will you therefore please strain the
Constitution, if you can’t actually disregaic
it in order to upset what has been done
just to oblige us*?” Whoever was responsible
for that plea should be ashamed of it, unless
it can be shown that the Ministers who made
this appointment got their power corruptly.
And if so a direct attack should be made.
so back to plenty; later, drouth for a season
to make a compulsory fallow, and so back to the
drunkenness of the rains once more.
The big blue hills frame this winding valley, one
of the most fruitful of the earth —30 miles or mole
of Paradise, and the serpent in it already. Nobody
sees or at least nobody notices the menace which is
yet so weak that a little quick and decisive action
will kill it. For three or four miles in the middle
of this valley the prickly pear is manoeuvring for
a strangle-hold. One farmer has his land cleai,
and two others on either- side are thoughtfully grow-
ing it for him. A fine field with a patch only
100 ft. long by 10ft. wide at the boundary fence
shows the curve in the furrows where the soft-
hearted ploughman avoided the curse. Of course
close and continuous tillage will beat any pest, but
there is much land in this valley which is first-
tlaas pasture and never sees the plough; and to
the extent of that this beautiful valley seems doomed,
for the people most interested either don’t see the
peril or do not appreciate it. There is a region in
South-west Queensland which a few years ago had
the pear so little that £IOO would have cleared up
the land. That pear lias grown until it is now 00
miles long and 20 miles wide, and in face of that
experience the apathy that watches the growth of
the pest anywhere is criminal. The Government has
cut the price of arsenic from £BO under private enter-
prise to £lO under State manufacture. Real cost is
£23, but £l3 is the Lands Department’s subsidy to
pear-destroyers. But the two farmer's who grow it to
the spoliation of themselves and the man between
should he smitten and smitten hard; and the big
estates which are pear nurseries should get their
due in a stiff tax on undeveloped lands so as to
encourage them to the leaving of some clear soil
for the generation that followeth.


Of Greater Importance than Gold
The Interstate Commission in the majority report stated:—
“. . . .this industry {iron and steel] is the basis of all other
industries, and every country has found it necessary to
encourage its prosperity, not only as it leads to considerable
employment, but because no country can afford to be wholly
dependent on outside sources for a supply of a metal
compared with which gold may even be looked upon as of
secondary importance.”
If all the iron and steel goods imported into Australia were made by our own people
work at Australian rates of pay would be given to not less than
30,000 MEN, r,™ %V2r“ & 5,000,000 per year.
Engineers should use only

POLITICAL
POINTS
Germany, it is reported, “could not be-
lieve its eyes” when it saw the list of war
criminals (800 or 900) whose surrender is
demanded. Well, the Alliance couldn’t be-
lieve its nose when it smelled the burning
towns and the burning humans in the Iluns’
track. But they were facts, nevertheless.
Factory work reached its best in Australia
in 1912, when 705 persons out of every
10,000 were doing something to prevent us
being at the mercy of the foreign profiteer.
In i 917 there were only 059. Among the
three States which count most in population
(Queensland. N. S. Wales and Victoria)
Queensland had the biggest drop (from 648
to 600 workers per 10,000 people) and makes
the poorest showing (600 workers per 10,000
against 635 in N. S. Wales and 836 in Vic-
toria). So it is naturally the State where
the cost of living is highest because it is
foreign-profiteered most.
HOUND ADVICE.
Ex-LIEUT SNOOT, A.S.S AND BAR (who en-
listed in England, you knoe): “Beastly
hard to find a position nowadays,
what ?”
EX-LIEUT, DINKUM AUSSIE : “Take my tip
and look for a job!”
Beaverbrook, the Scotcli-Canadian who
owns a title and the London Daily Express,
and during the war was one of the heads of
propaganda, has started another campaign,
This time he wants the country to hand up
its old gold—even its new gold—its erra-
ments and its plate, in order to buy Britain
out of bondage to the U.S.A., just as after
the Franeo-Prussian war France handed up
its gold to free itself from the German. It is
a quite reasonable proposition, running on
the lines of that recent protest of The
Bulletin’s against the use of the currency-
metal at present for any other than currency
purposes. There should be an absolute pro-
hibition against the manufacture of further
gold-ware of any kind; and if on top of that
patriotic people will throw in their old gold,
so mucn the better. But there isn’t much
use boiling down jewellery and plate in order
to pay off Unc. Sam and get out of bondage
if the ship that takes the gold takes also an
order for Yankee goods to 10 times the value
of the gold. The self-denial that stops im-
ports is the self-denial that is called for first,
last and all the time.
In Melbourne bricks are £5 10s. a thou-
sand. Bricklayers refuse 225. a day and
carpenters £5 ss. a week ; and the ordinary
laborer may by and by be getting a tenner
an hour. When he has done his day’s toil he
will retire to his bark mia-mia, put on a
clean change of newspapers—unless he can
get fig leaves —listen to some speeches on
profiteering, and retire to rest on his couch
of dried grass to wonder whether his £lO
per hour is much use to him, after all.
Westralia had a deficit of £122,079 for
January. That makes about the 103rd
monthly shortage, and the accumulated deficit
is now £4,023,230. Yet the Golden State has
been, through Hi years of going to the dogs,
always one of the lowest taxed and often the
lowest taxed of the States. It could put itself
straight at any moment by coming up among
the higher-taxed. The inscrutable men at
Perth only smile darkly in their whiskers
or their sleeves and say they won’t do it —
they will let deficits go on. Now, what is
the game?
The German ex-Crown Prince claims now
that he always strove to bring England and
Germany together. Presumably lie’s sorry
lie succeeded.
The N.S.W. State Ministry has been
strengthened by the addition of two land-
owners. two agents, a Welshman, a violent
teetotaller and an ex-Salvationist. The
names of this collection are Crane, Grimm
and Bruntnell. Bruntnell was a Salva-
tionst till he became a house and land
dealer. Crane is a stock and station dealer
who owns land. Grimm owns land hut
doesn’t deal. There is no manufacturer in
the collection. There never is.
Higgs, the new Fourth (or is it Fifth?)
Party in the Reps., finds himself without a
room and will have to retire to the gym-
nasium or the coal-hole to invent his policy,
lie threatens a platform that will probably
include the early appointment of a Minister
for Information. All through his political
life Higgs, eager to re-establish Parliamen-
tary Government, has panted for details on
various subjects, and has given many an in-
terrogated Minister a lot of hard practice
in the art of evasion.
The N. S. Wales Premier states proudly
that he has, within quite a short time, be-
guiled 2000 more men from reproductive
industries to make loan railways to Rabbit-
burgh and Dingotown. This is only a be-
ginning, but already great hopes are enter-
tained of increasing the brick and house
shortage and crippling the woollen and
shipbuilding and other trades—businesses
that can’t pay their employees out of loans,
so they work at a disadvantage. If Holman
can get enough loans the homeless com-
munity will lead a rude existence in trees,
and everybody will have a railway to himself.
According to a cable, Japan has intimated
that Solf, the ex-German administrator in
the Pacific, wouldn’t be an acceptable Ger-
man Ambassador in Tokio. The Jap is wise.
He has his own game to play in the Pacific;
and when a man is playing a game of chess
he doesn’t want a monkey on his shoulder
to make mischief with the pieces.
By one of the chances of agriculture the
tobacco crop at Bathurst (N.S.W.) has
been killed by fungus, the loss being £20,000.
Opening the import list at random the writer
dropped on “corsets,” and found that if we
had made them instead of importing them
the value of one year’s crop of this one small
article would have been £354,484. Corsets
are seldom attacked by fungus.
House famine is growing worse in Mel-
bourne if such a thing can be, so the build-
ing employees, having just secured a con-
siderable increase in wages, have decided to
sacrifice- part of it and aggravate the trouble.
They have cut down the working week from
44 hours to 40 by the simple device of not
turning up on Saturday. Apparently they
don’t realise that it means extra misery for
fellow-creatures, in most eases fellow-
workers ; and the deplorable thinsr is that
their alleged leaders are not game to tell
them that that is the fact.
Heaven only knows how S. Aus. keeps
such a public service as it has. A quite
characteristic thing happened the other day.
The Government wanted a chief assistant to
the Government Astronomer—or thought it
did: the individual States, don’t, of course,
want astronomers at all. Applications were
called; salary, £3OO a year. A brainy young
graduate of the local University was so
highly recommended by the Government
Astronomer and others that he was promptly
chosen. Then the Government discovered he
was working for £2lO in another Government
department; and, though it had decided
that the joh in the Observatory was worth
£3OO, and that this man was singularly suit-
able, the Government decided that £9O a year
was an unheard of rise, and he could have
only £250 a year. He kicked, naturally, and
refused to take it; whereupon the second
man on the list, an outsider, was appointed
at the full £3OO.
The Me. Socialist party is still suffering
from its new pain. A few years ago, at a
stage when Maurice Blackburn and other
active members refused to lie down and be
good when another section made certain anti-
Defence proposals, there was an internal
upheaval. Cursing took place in 10
languages, whiskers were torn out by the
roots, lady members broke umbrellas over
one another’s husbands, and Blackburn and
some others were thrown into the arms of
Labor —not so unwillingly as might have
been expected if there hadn’t been an As-
sembly seat handy to hold Blackburn and liis
new love. Now, on a matter of tactics —
the employment of intellectual methods as
against the application of the boot —the
same sort of wrangle has been furiously
proceeding. To the outsider the disturb-
ance may seem hardly more important than
a civil war in a beehive; but it’s a very
vital affair to the true-red Socialist.
ONE THING AT A TIME.
“Japan and U.S.A. are amassing armaments at
a furious pace.”— Cable.
THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH ( feverishly ):
“No! I haven’t made a ploughshare out
of your sword yet! Gimme time, girl,
gimme time! Can’t you see I’m kept
gain’ reversing the process ?”
According to a cable (8/2/’2O), U.S.
Naval Secretary Daniels charged Admiral
Sims with “stating that General Pershing
failed to break the German lines, and that
the American Navy played a small part com-
pared with the British. Mr. Daniels accord-
ingly refused Admiral Sims’s decorations,
regarding him as a British propagandist.”
This should mean the ruin of Sims. He has
been convicted of (1) telling the truth :
(2) modesty—in plain, brutal English, of
being a gentleman.
Davey Hall will be a long way away by
the time the election brickbats fall, which,
considering the weakness* of his majority at
the best of times, is a very good thing for
Davey Hall; but if several of his friends are
hit hard by the bricks of houses that
haven’t been built, they can thank the little
man’s habit of making a noise like an entire
new village of desirable residences every
time that a dog-kennel was started. Yet D.
Hall is a mere victim of his environment in
a country where the art of Government con-
sists largely of doing nothing and saying a
lot about it.
Even the worms of the sea have their bite
at the wheat which has to be dragged over
oceans to its foreign market. The Laurel
Whalen, a five-masted motor schooner, was
pressed into the job of humping Australian
wheat from the land where it was rotting
and being eaten by mice and weevils, to
Europe; but the Laurel Whalen, being very
old, got only as far as Tahiti before it was
found to be leaking. So the wheat, which
was laboriously humped in, was laboriously
humped out, and is still on the wharf at
Papeete, of course improving itself. Some-
body has got to pay for all this; and the
Australian farmer ought to know by this
time who that somebody is. Nevertheless
he still mostly barracks for a fiscal policy
which compels him to depend upon the dis-
tant foreigner to buy his product.
Randolph Bedford, M.L.C., in defence: —
All the rage last season, and likely to be the
fashion of this, is the habit of roaring about the
Queensland railway deficit of the last four years.
Queensland in proportion to population has many
times more mileage of railroads than any other
country. With about 150,000 less people for all
tlie State than the population of centralised Sydney,
it has put its operatives in a better position than
the railroad men of any other State. Figures
during the election were made to say anything
against the Labor Government, but the facts are
that in the last 26 years there have been only two
years showing a surplus, and those two surpluses
were obviously manufactured by bookkeeping.
And with a large wave of the hand Bedford
(M.L.C.) introduces a statement prepared by
Railway Minister Fihelly giving the financial
results from ISS3 onward. These figures
show that in the past four Ryan-Fihell.v
years the railway deficit has amounted to
£3,723,259; in the previous 10 years it
amounted to only £543,290. If Bedford can
get any comfort out of that comparison he
would also find joy in the company of an
over-dead whale.
Some weeks ago a practical woman-corres-
pondent put it to The Bulletin that if
steps were taken to form a strong co. to set
returned Diggers at all kinds of wool-work-
ing, including the manufacturing of tweed.s
and stockings, she
would (1) take shares,
(2) canvass for sub-
scriptions for shares
without commission
and (3) pledge her
own custom and can-
vass for customers,
also without commis-
sion. Every week since
then correspondents
have written offering
to do the same thing.
Yet no action of any
sort is taken ; instead,
the Repat., co-operat-
ing with the State
Governments, c o li-
tanies to buy land at
l ast cost to settle men
with no farming ex-
perience upon it; and
meantime the country
goes further into bon-
dage to the foreigner
for imported woollen
goods, at ft time when
Britain is puzzling
how to get itself and
its overseas common-
wealths out of bon-
dag e. If soldiers’
associations got to
work and set this wool
business going, pre-
ferably with the co-
operation of the Re-
put., not only would the Digger he enor-
mously benefited,, but Britnin would be
relieved of the burden which seriously
threatens to overwhelm it.
A deputation called on Prime Minister
Hughes re the wool situation and left a
very stunned little Welshman behind them.
They told him that there was, and had been
for two years or more, a suspicion that it
was the policy of the Central Wool Com-
mittee to export dirty to be washed
and combed abroad and thus pay wages to
aliens, while restricting the supplies of local
factories and keeping local industry at a
minimum. Incidentally they instanced the
notorious case of the Colonial Spinning Co.’s
works at Botany (Sydney) which have been
practically closed for IS months. Hughes,
apparently, hadn’t heard of it. If there was
a Minister for Manufactures in the uabinet,
and lie and his aides were real manufac-
turers, the Cabinet would know all about
such things. But apparently we shall first
have to make a complete change in our
method of appointing Ministers.
The people you meet in Melbourne with
Jap baskets are not country people down
for the show. They are farmers bought
out by the Repatriation Department. The
method of creating soldier settlers is
easy. In. January the Vic. Closer
Settlement Board purchased 57.435 acres
for £350,543, or about £6 per acre, from
83 persons. Trices ran from £3 to £5O an
acre. The total area thus far bought in
Victoria is 544,730 acres for £4,223,547, or
£7 14s. an acre. What has become of the
S 3 farmers who sold out in January? And
where are the agriculturists who got rid of
44 million pounds’ worth of land? How is
the State going to benefit by paying expert
farmers to go off their holdings and putting
in their placed men and women who know
nothing of the business? It is worse than
cutting off the tail of your shirt to make a
frilled collar out of the stuff.
Sydney suburban tobacconists are not
going behind Holman’s back to say that his
Early Closing Act Amendment—which shuts
smoke-shops at 7 p.m. and on Saturday after-
noons—was a move to fatten the city trade
at their expense. Previously the suburban
“dive” depended on its evening sales; now
many of its former customers—who don't
get home from toil much before 7 —stock
up before leaving town. A newly-formed
suburban association is getting ready to do
Holman no good some time about March.

Sydney Ferries, Ltd., runs the C.S.R. Co. a
close second in having Royal Commissions
appointed to dig into its affairs. F. N. Yar-
wood X-ra.ved it in 1!)17; and last year,
when the directors once more bumped up
fares, there was such a yell that the Holman
Government called on the Board of Trade to
inquire into the co.’s operations. The Board’s
report, as the S.F. directors now say, “gen-
erally speaking was distinctly in the co.’s
favor, and fully justified the action taken
by the directors in increasing the fares.”
But if the very thorough report clearly
showed that without the increased fares the*
co. could not “earn a dividend of 7 p.c. on
the capital actually employed,” it further
demonstrated how the public had been bled
in the past. Twenty years ago Sydney Ferries
took over the North Shore Steam Ferry Co.,
paying £120,600 in shares of £1 each. (The
capital of the old co. was £60,000.) In 1017
Balmain New Ferry was acquired for 50,OIK)
paid £1 shares. Since 1000 shareholders have
also put up £184,540 in cash. Altogether,
then, shareholders bought a £354,840 share
interest in the co. The balance-sheet now
shows a paid capital of £516,667, the differ-
ence of £161,827 representing bonus shares
issued as follows: 1006, £20,000; 1010,
£25,217 ; 1014, £116,610. Even that does not
represent the compulsory benevolence of the
ferry customer to the proprietors. The
Board of Trade had the co.’s assets appraised
--“a bona ;fide appraisal which disregarded
temporary fluctuations,” and the one which
the co. “put forward as the capital basis
upon which it should be permitted to assess
the charges upon the public.” This showed
that, whereas at December, 1018, the pub-
lished accounts claimed £568,334 of assets,
the valuation indicated £817,700. Thus to
represent the £354,840 of cash put into the
concern the valuation of a little over a year
ago unearthed assets worth £817,700; in
other words, the public and unearned in-
crement in 20 years made Sydney Ferries a
present of £462,860 on a cash-paid capital
of £354,840. And meantime £455,054 has
been paid in dividends.
All this, however, belongs more or less to
the past. That the co. was allowed to go on
charging excessive fares and fatten its share-
holders from a public service the ferry travel-
ler has himself to blame. It is no use punch-
ing Jones for some misdeed of his long-ago
school-days; and it would lead to trouble if
you happened to mistake Jones’s brother for
Jones and waylaid the wrong party. And
that is the position of Sydney Ferries now.
It is no longer the very opulent affair it used
to be, despite the figures just given, and,
besides, many of the old hands who were fat-
tened have given way, at a good price, to
new-comers, who apparently considered that
such divs. and bonuses were going to flow
for ever. Though the new-comers are well
enough protected insofar as assets are con-
cerned, the p.c. dividends give a very mild
return for those who bought in at 275. and
over only four years ago. Most ferry travel-
lers, however, still regard the co. as an ex-
tortioner, and talk of “stock waterings” and
so on. But there has been no stock watering;
there are assets worth far more than the
capital in the business. That there were large
issues of bonus capital is another matter;
out the passenger of years ago provided that
feast. Nowadays the management appar-
ently finds it difficult to make sufficient to
pay reasonable dividends. In fact, on the
£750,060, which is estimated by the Board
of Trade to be the capital employed in the
main and subsidiary businesses, the return is
unreasonably small.
If an admission by the directors that the
subsidiary cos. “accounted for no less than
2£ p.c. of the total dividend recommended
for the year” states the position fairly, then
the £540,000 or so of ferry assets during 191 S
earned only £31,632, equal to a return of
under 6 p.c. The present actual value of
these assets is, however, probably £lOO.OOO
or so greater. Nevertheless The Bulletin
will not guarantee that that was the full
extent of the net earnings of the ferry ser-
vices, for no information is given concerning
depreciation allowances made. The co. can-
not expect the public to appreciate its diffi-
culties until it comes into the light and
explains fully each year what it is providing
for depreciation and contingencies. Profits
have in the past been socked away by over-
charging on these accounts, and there is
nothing to prevent a recurrence. The Com-
mission reported that, though “the total cost
of ship property has been £440,417, the value
to-day, notwithstanding substantial sales, is
£450,000”; yet the book value at Dec. 31
last was only £273,783. The question arises
on this whether in the public interest the
depreciation allowance should not be fixed
as between the Government and the co.
Otherwise the co. may wipe off unduly large
amounts of profit and then plead that it can-
not give a reasonable return to shareholders
without further increases of fares.
One other matter which calls for the con-
stant use of a microscope is the operation of
the Harbor, Land and Transport Co., Ltd.,
which now amalgamates the two subsidiary
cos. formed about 18 months ago when the
ferry business was separated from other
interests. S.F., Ltd., owns all the £107,000
capital in this concern, which, on a valuation
made for the Commission, was found to own
assets worth over half as much again. This
co. publishes no balance-sheet, and as any
profits transferred to the parent co. are not
shown separately, it is impossible to tell
how much it is claimed that the ferry ser-
vices have earned. The two cos. are so neatly
linked that a lot of things can happen ; one
of which is that the parent co.’s profits are
now capable of being regulated to a nicety.
The Sydney Ferries’ present position is
that it has a. paid capital of £516,667, of
which £41)2,357 represents the book value of
fixed assets and interests in the subsidiary
co., though as shown above the actual pre-
sent value it vastly greater. Further,
there may now also be the beginnings of an
undistributed surplus piling up in the sub-
sidiary co. In the parent co.’s balance-sheet
there are net surplus liquid assets amounting
to £66,248. This accumulation will be cut
into presently to provide new steamers, of
which the co. is badly in need ; and while
they are going to prove expensive (a recent
estimate for two boats was double the pre-
war cost), they will not help immediate
earnings to any extent, though the house-
building boom which the north side of the
harbor is now experiencing will presently
add considerably to the co.’s revenue.

“The directors have for some time,” says
the latest report, “been considering the desir-
ability of adjusting the values of the assets
in the co.’s books as at June 30, 1914, and
with a view to doing this arranged with
experts of recognised standing and ability
to go carefully into same.” The result is that
the accounts now show reserves in this way:
Reserves, at June 30, 1914 . . . . £98,108
Since June 30, 1914 .. . . 15,266
£113,374
Add the £452 at credit of the contingencies
account and also the £202 balance of Profit
and Loss, and reserves total the £114,028
shown in the table. At June, 1914, the'
accounts (then published half-yearly) dis-
closed reserves of £18,153 (apart from £728
set aside for contingencies) ; but the experts
declare that the true reserves at that date
were £98,108. Further, according to the
balance-sheets issued between June, 1914,
and December, 1918, visible reserves ex-
panded by £32,537, apart from the contin-
gencies appropriations. But according to
the adjustments now made only £15,266, plus
the £202 in P. and L. account, has been
piled up during that period and the past
year. If all this is correct, the only possible
conclusions The Bulletin can come to are
(1) that prior to June, 1914, the published
accounts understated the true profits to an
extent of nearly £80,000; and (21 that dur-
ing the past 5J years the co. made £17,000-
odd less profit that the directors claimed in
their balance-sheets. Anyhow, that amount
of reserves, declared to have been accumu-
lated since 1914, has now disappeared.
A comparison of -the balance-sheet figures
is not very illuminating:—

Cash assets are shown less dividends de-
clared. Since 1914 there have been no big
alterations in the fleet. The little s.s.
Ivaruah was sold; on the other hand the
s.s. Wyalong (94 tons), Allyn River (143
tons) and apparently a 400-ton wooden
steamer have been added. These trans-
actions obscure any view of what has been
clipped off to provide for depreciation and
other things. However, though the accounts
claim that only £15,408 of reserves (in-
cluding insurance, repairs accounts, etc.)
have been accumulated, the surplus of more
or less liquid assets has moved from £72,318
to £108.165 —an improvement of £35,847 —
in the 54 years. The resurrection of prac-
tically £80,060 of internal reserves as at
.Tune, 1914, necessarily means a writing up
of fixed assets to that extent at that date,
and in that way this further comparison is
possible :—■
June,’l4. Dec.,’l9.
Fixed assets £127,784 £106,068 Decrease, £21,716
Surplus liquid
assets.. .. 72,318 ■ 108,165 Increase, 35,847
No doubt the object of the juggle is to clear
the track for a capitalisation of reserves
later on. A bonus issue of shares out of
reserves accumulated since June, 1914, is
subject to Federal taxation, but any distri-
bution out of profits made prior to that date
is not taxable.
The present position of the co. is that it
has surplus liquid assets of over £BOOO in
excess of the paid capital of £lOO,OOO, while
the book value of fixed assets is set down
at a further £106,068. This figure, however,
gives the value of the fleet and property as
at June, 1914, less depreciation allowances
since made, but of course includes any differ-
ence between sales and realisations during
the period. But the admitted suppression of
profits prior to 1914 and the unexplained dis-
crepancy between the balance-sheet reserves
and the figures revealed as a result of the
“adjustment” only emphasise what this paper
has remarked on many previous occasions:
that shipping cos.’ accounts are generally
presented in such a way that they are of
little value to the outsider. It is a matter
of trusting entirely to those inside whether a
shipping co. is doing as well as it should
or is making more than is in the public
interest.

Maoriland took a more rational view of
its war bill than the Commonwealth, and
demanded that at least some of it should be
paid out of current revenue. Consequently
taxes have been piled on to such an extent
that, though this co.’s gross revenue has ex-
panded by 24 p.c. since 1913, net profits
are £2OOO or so less. This comparison gives
details: —•

Had taxation merely doubled during the war
period the co. would last year have shown
a return of over 11 p.c. on capital. But
the Treasury demand has increased sixfold,
with the result that a little over 8 p.c. is
the best the management can do. Total
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves)
are now earning under 5 p.c. p.a.-—a poor
return for a business in which abnormal con-
ditions tend to increase risks. But the man-
agement does not seem to have been much
concerned on this score, judging by the addi-
tional liabilities incurred during the uncer-
tain war period, and the new advances made :
1913. 1917. 1918. 1919.

During 1918 the co. did put the brake on
lightly, though amounts owing and owed
were considerably greater than in pre-war
days. During the past year, however, the
management has hit out again; Maoriland
has been doing so very well out of its staples
that a wave of prosperity has been experi-
enced. Conditions have thus been favorable
for the co. to ask and collect higher interest
without much bother, though no doubt the co.
in turn has had to pay more for the bur-
rowed money on which it depends for increas-
ing its business. The extent of these increases
is not visible in the accounts. What is
clear is that owing to increased taxation
all the extra work and worry of handling
additional business and undertaking heavier
risks have gone for nothing. Instead of
improved divs., shareholders have had less.
With practically 02 per cent, of all assets
represented by vague “mortgages and other
securities,” the soundness of the co. neces-
sarily depends on Maoriland’s future, the
discretion of the management in the choos-
ing of risks and the terms on which the
deposits are held. Apparently there will not
be much in the concern for shareholders for
some time owing to heavy taxation; but they
should do better again as conditions ap-
proach the new normal.
The C.S.R., whose prospects in Fiji looked
blue owing to the absolute stoppage by the
Government of India of all coolie emigra-
tion, hasn’t given up hope. A Bombay cor-
respondent reports that the position in Fiji
is being represented as extremely precari-
ous owing to the Government’s action, and
that a “mission” is to arrive in India in
Anril or May “to endeavor to arrange with
the Government conditions mi which immi-
gration to Fiji may be resumed.”

From an Australian mining man with
much American experience :
It is time that the present propaganda against
the United States was combated. Every considera-
tion demands that we should seek to establish a
closer relationship and understanding with that
country, and it is to be deplored that on all sides
we hear nothing but expressions of malice and
prejudice as to America’s sins of omission and com-
mission before the war, during the war, and after
the war. The latest sample of ignorance is that
the fall in exchange is due to the evil machinations
of Wall-street. While it lias been open to anyone
to take advantage of the persistent decline, it must
bo evident to the simplest mind that it is hurting
American trade far more than it is hurting us as
a nation. While one pound is worth $3.25, a
decline in value of 30 per cent., it is also worth
49 francs, a depreciation in value of the franc of
nearly GO per cent. There are manipulators in
Threadneedle-street all right!
The actual reason is deeper-seated than the un-
favorable trade balance, and is in England itself,
not America. England is not on a gold basis, for
the metal is quoted there at £6 ss. 9d. per on.
(February 4). In the United States an oz. is still
at the normal rate of $20.67 currency, because the
currency is backed by the same value in gold. The
dollar of the IJnitqd States contains 23.22 grains of
pure gold, and the British sovereign contains 113
grains of pure gold. It therefore takes 113 divided
by 23.22 or 4.86 dollars to equal one sovereign.
Now, in examining an ordinary trade transaction in
a light comprehensible to the layman, as the
American manufacturer pays for his labor and raw
material in currency equivalent to gold, he has
necessarily to get something equivalent to gold in
exchange. If we buy an article in the United States
for $4.86, we have to pay either one sovereign or
113 grains of gold for it. To buy this amount of
gold in London, which is our clearing-house, we have
to pay at presen t £1 9s. 7d. in currency. Why do
we have to pay this instead of a £ 1 note ? Because
our currency is being continually diluted by paper
of no intrinsic value. If we take a pint of water
and add it to a pint of whisky, we may call the
result two pints of whisky, but unfortunately it
doesn’t make it so, nor can we get the price of two
pints of whisky for it, though we can still blame the
other fellow because he refuses to accept it as two
pints of whisky, thank God !
It is evident, therefore, that if the balance of
trade were in our favor, American exchange would
still be at a premium, and would remain so until
the Americans, in adjusting their balance, had
shipped us sufficient gold to put our currency on
its pre-war basis, or until one oz. of gold was worth
£4 4s. lOd. currency.
Objection mav be taken to the last para-
graph, and none at all to the earlier ones. If
the balance of trade were in our favor Ame-
rican exchange would, it is true, still be at
a premium ; but not for long. ißncver will
be at anything but a premium so long as
the balance o'f trade is against us, or until
we borrow enormously from the U.S.A. —
and that would be worse.
It is an ill wind that blows nobody any
good. As The Bulletin pointed out the
other day, the poor purchasing value of the
pound in the U.S.A. is equivalent to an
export duty on American products; where-
fore European buyers are turning in other
directions for goods hitherto bought in
U.S.A. One result is that Australian cop-
per producers are finding far less difficulty
in getting rid of their metal than they did
during most of last year. The latest quota-
tion for gold, by the way, is £6 7s. 4d.,
which makes the paper pound worth about
13s. 3d.


The advantage of having battery charging current
on tap in the home garage is now within the reach
of every motorist. The G.E. Mercury Arc Batterv
Charger makes any ordinary lighting circuit a source
of energy for starting, lighting, and ignition bat-
teries. Its cost is a mere trifle compared with the
convenience and economy of home charging. An
overnight boosting charge every few weeks will not
only increase the efficiency of a battery, but will
also lengthen the life of the plates. You should

The 10 p.c. div. looks sweet enough; but
besides the 185,000 of capital there is
107,000-odd of visible reserves in the busi-
ness, so total shareholders' funds are earning
under 6 p.c. p.a., and the dividend return is
equal to a poor little p.c. p.a. It is now
55 years since this concern first invited Bal-
larat to trust it with its cash, and during
that long period it has made no effort to
extend beyond its home town. But the big
metropolitan banks were not backward in
setting up in competition, and while the dis-
trict’s gold yield has gradually faded, the
congestion policy has made the progress of
Ballarat in other respects slow r . lienee the
Ballarat Bank is now holding less of the
public’s money than it had 30 years ago:—

Advances . . . . 355,295 305,132 353,266
Premises 3,650 3,630 2,500
Since liabilities are now smaller than in
1880, and meantime £71,812 more share-
holders’ funds have been put into the busi-
ness, the bank is much stronger than it used
to be from the point of view of depositors.
In fact, there is probably no other Austra-
lian bank which, on figures, offers creditors
such security. For every £1 Bs. 3d. en-
trusted to its care, the bank itself has put
£1 into the business. Put another way: to
meet the £168,976 of deposits not represented
by liouid assets there are advances with a
book value of £353,266, besides £2500 of pre-
mises. But the fact that liabilities are very
small in relation to the bank’s own funds
means lean earnings. And the immediate
prospect of an improved return is not bright.
Lately a branch was established at Ballarat
East, but though that move may bring in
a little more business, it is not likely to
help profits to any great extent. Certainly
the extension does not help to solve the
problem of a wider distribution of risks. And
the chances of finding customers in fields
where the big concerns are scrapping for
business are very slight now.

Last year was one of extremes for this co.
During the earlier half ’flu troubles resulted
in a record small profit; the latter half pro-
duced the best results since the reconstruc-
tion in 1912. But though shareholders had
to forego a div. for the June term, and not-
withstanding that the latest figures have
brought the year’s profit well up to past
averages, the lost dividend is not being made
good. Instead, £l2OO is being written off
lease and furniture accounts. Business is
conducted in premises held on lease which
has still over 10 years to run. Besides pay-
ing dividends the co. has to try to provide
for a return of capital when it loses its
rights. On the last occasion when the lease
expired the necessary provision had not been
made, hence the reconstruction mentioned
above, considerable capital then having to
be written off as lost. Paid capital is now
£12,250 —35,000 shares of 10s. each paid
to 7s. —and after payment of the current
div. there were liquid assets amounting to
£3728 in excess of the liabilities. That leaves
something like £B5OO of capital to be made
good in 10 years after providing for main-
tenance and paying dividends. For the co.
to distribute 10 p.c. each year to share-
holders and pack its bag with sufficient of
its own belongings to refund capital in 10
years’ time, net profits of about £lO5O will
have to show up each half. With ordinary
luck the co. has a fair chance of managing
this; for the task grows easier with the ac-
cumulation of revenue-earning assets. But
prohibition and other possible troubles must
not be overlooked.
The Badak gamble is still going strong,
despite the lack of -reliable
The past week has seen the registration ot
the Badak Venture, and Badak Perak and a
preliminary meeting of the Bux. And
about the most any of the concerns can
offer investors is a promise to “immediately
undertake boring.” What most of the
gamblers OA-erlook is that the areas now re-
ceiving so much attention are not new to
tin-men. The State of Kedak has produced
some tin, but if there are any very good
things lying around they have been missed
lr' r the hard-heads who worked the Taiping
Valley only 70 miles away. _ Certainly
Badak is jungle country, but it is by no
means inaccessible. Despite the reports of
rich values, none of the areas the subject
of a gamble have yet been proved. Isolated
bores giving high returns are met with often
by the expert, but he is not deluded into
making that single return the average for
the whole property. There is an ominous
silence concerning the check-boring which is
proceeding at the Badak. In the first place
the original nores were not put down on any
regular plan, and so far the result of only
one check bore has been received, and that
was weeks ago. Yet on deep-dredging
ground it is not unusual to sink two bores
a day. So far as Australia knows, Badak
has actually proved little more than a square
yard of its ground, yet Melbourne values
the shares at £l4OO apiece!

Great Cobar (N.S.W.) the other day
applied for further suspension of labor con-
ditions on Cobar Gold and Chesney leases.
This time David Fell, representative of the
London receiver, put in an appearance and
told the warden that under present conditions
copper could not be produced by the smelters
under £125 per ton. He was not asked for
details, though only a few months ago £94
per ton was the figure submitted. Great Cobar
talks of some new scheme in prospect each
time it appears before tne warden. Since its
previous application C. S. Faul and Hogan
Taylor had conferred, so the latest is a pro-
posal to raise £lOO,OOO for the erection of a
flotation plant. Cobarites, however, have
wearied of the whole business, and recently
held a meeting to take steps to oppose sus-
pension. But after hearing David Fell it
was decided to give the concern another
chance. A further three months’ grace has
accordingly been granted, by which time it
will be known Avhat chance the receiver has
of raising necessary funds. It is rumored
that the Government has been appealed to for
assistance. Also it would not be surprising
to find George Blakeniore once more in
charge—if the co. ever does get to work.

After many unsuccessful attempts to
secure nermission of the Federal Treasury
to float off Stackpool’s lease, the White
Crystal, Ardlethan, decided to sit back until
the restrictions were lifted. The flotation is
now being proceeded with—in a co. of
150,000 shares of ss. each. The sins of the
parent co. are in the pup before its birth :
no less than half the shares are being issued
as paid to 2s. to White Crystal shareholders,
the remainder being offered at 2s. on applica-
tion. Melbourne, which seems to have under-
stood all about the inner workings of White
Crystal, is said to have almost cleared itself
of the scrip, and Sydney is nursing the baby.
In which case, why is Stackpool’s Crystal
being registered in Melbourne? The market
has lately seen another flutter in Crystals,
the Devil perhaps knows why. Incidentally,
is t i plant which is now being installed at
Ardlethan identical with that at the old
North Nuggetty Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.),
which was auctioned for under £oooo a few
months ago?

The Hampton Plains boom has produced
its full complement of wild kittens, and ex-
travagant and misleading reports are being
spread broadcast about shows which haven’t
a ghost of a hope. One “mine” reported to
have a “high grade” ore-body in sight, and
for which the vendors asked a large price,
was found by an expert to be worth barely
2dwt. Another show claimed to have a lode
“as good as the Celebration”, was able to
produce only traces. Still another recently
floated, and in which the manager had re-
ported the existence of a “fine lode showing
good payable values at two different points,”
on inspection revealed ore as poor as Laza-
rus. and then only in a formation of very
unpromising appearance. A favorite method
of boomsters is to select from a reef a small
piece of stone showing gold, and then report
the return as representing the value of the
whole. Reports of assay values from Hamp-
ton Plains, unless coming from men of
known ability and standing, should be re-
ceived with extreme caution. Apart from
the Celebration and White Hope, the only
lease on the whole field that has shown any
promise to date is the Mutooroo, about a
mile south of the Celebration, and that as
yet is little more than a prospect.
Many a long day has passed since Dick
Osborne, advised by his late dad, Captain
Osborne, took up the Mutooroo blocks,
Broken Hill way, and pulled something like
£lO,OOO out of the venture. Since those
days the old claim has been shepherded more
or less by the co. The attraction was and
is the size of the copper-bearing formation,
as well as the belief that even though low-
grade it may come in one day as a copper-
leaching or as a sulphur-making proposi-
tion. Sheer tiredness over its inability to
get capital to work the copper show' led the
Board to turn to Hampton Plains. As
Rutter Clarke, Osborne’s old Adelaide part-
ner, was on the spot, he may have furnished
the inspiration to take up a lease. Any-
way the co. got hold of a block a mile south
of the Celebration, over which it holds an
option for £5OOO, the vendors to get 6000
shares, to be further entitled if the option
is exercised to call for a tenth interest in
the Mutooroo Co. in paid-up scrip. The
crosscut put in east at 50ft. lias got into a
choice run of stone. For the first 32ft.
assays went from a trace to 12dwt., and
thence on to the end of the crosscut the
stone averages 2oz. Fully sft. of schist
and quartz is supposed to top the 4oz. mark.
On the strength of this the market rushed
the shares, giving the show a market valua-
tion of over £70.000. This is not so bad as
some other recent plunging, but it is solid
going. One feature is that at last some of
the old copper crow'd who stuck to the co.
for 10 or 12 years are getting a little of
their own back. Dorrie Doolette has taken
up two blocks for the Borland and Rudd
syndicate next door, and Block 50. to the
east, has matured as a new' co. in Adelaide.
Celebration Junction’s first general state-
ment to shareholders is tinged with dis-
appointment. Values in the costeens and
prospecting shafts were, according to the
directors, all right to start with, but gradu-
ally dwindled in sinking and have not im-
proved in crosscutting and driving at 50ft.
and 100 ft. A meeting has been convened to
consider the position and decide whether
the co. w'ill apply for an extension of the
option t W'hich expires on March 9 or not.
Cash in hand amounts to £2112, against
which there is a small amount due to
creditors. The purchase consideration is
£15,000 and a third interest, so that even if
things do improve the co. would require a
good deal of money to acquire the show and
carry on.

A fortune awaits anyone who can find a
cheap method of treating the mountainous
heaps of residues at Kalgoorlie. In one
dump alone the Great Boulder has 6,000,000
tons containing nearly £400,000 worth of
gold, and every other big mine on the Golden
Mile has hundreds of thousands of pounds in
its dumps. In the early days, and, in fact,
for years after Kalgoorlie got a move on,
the declared value of Boulder residues was
about the highest on the field, and because
of this other cos. claimed to be better man-
aged. But w'hen their tailings were later
treated over and over agaiii with surprisingly
good results, Boulder’s admitted losses in
residues looked very mild.
* * * *
Associated Northern is now considering
what it will do about letting tributes. At
Kalgoorlie one party, which is working the
remnants of a pipe of ore in a part of the
property where the co. never tried, has paid
over £40,000 in royalty during the past IS
months, while at Ora Banda, where opera-
tions by the co. were for some time carried
on at a loss, tributors are also doing not at
all badly.

Edna May Main Lode, promoted in Alec
Peacock’s odice in early Westonia days, still
having £2OOO in cash to splash after throw-
ing in the towel, sent Charlie Bryant over to
Westralia to hunt for a new claim. Find-
ing prices too stiff around about Hampton
Plains he looked up other possibilities, and
now recommends the Kanowna Consols, from
which 13640 z. gold has been got from 1620
tons, with S9oz. coming from a bit of a hole
under the 300 ft. level. The co. has taken
the mine under option for six months for
£250 cash and in consideration of sinking
75ft. and doing some crosscutting. Then, if
decent stone is got, the co. will part up
£3OOO and 9000 shares paid to 3s. Kanowna
shoots are short and patchy, but Victorians
don’t mind that if the grade is O.K.

Queen Margaret, once the mainstay of Bu-
lonv (W.A.) and the nride of a small
Melbourne co., has been re-pegged in anti-
cipation of the Hampton Plains boom spread-
ing in that direction. The show proved
very patchy and closed down in 1903 with
a production of a quarter of a million ster-
ling to its credit. There may be a little gold
left, but not enough for a co. to bother
about. Bulong also has an abandoned deep-
lead to which the same remark applies.
Alex. Montgomery, W.A. State mining
engineer, has examined the big iron ore
deposits at Yampi Sound, a land-locked har-
bor between King Sound and Collier Bay,
and pronounces them first-class. The ore is
of unusual purity and free from phosphorus
and sulphur. Ore above high-water mark is
estimated at 97,300,000 tons with more un-
told millions below sea level. Montgomery
suggests sending the ore east to be smelted
using coal as backloading to Yampi Sound!
But the resources and possibilities of Wes-
tralia’s own Collie coalfields should be fully
considered first.
After having piloted Oswalds, Maldon
(Vic.), for 16 years, and then taken the
tiller at Sloane and Scotchman’s (Stawell).
where he had plenty of ore but little gold’,
John Couchman goes to Westralia to the
Devon. This Linden mine has given some
good returns, but the question ahead is
whether John Couchman will have a shoot
to follow 7 when he burrows deeper.

Starke, the new High Court Judge, would
argue the point with a lamp-post if he
cdulcin’t embroil anyone or anything else;
and the fact that it didn’t say a word in
reply would merely make him not only more
positive but more vehement. He was always
like that: in fact, he seemed more like it
formerly than he did later on when he com-
pelled himself to sometimes forget his argu-
ment long enough to be polite. “I like your
argument better than your manner,” Hood,
J., once told him. And he certainly hadn’t
meant to be rude to Hood —he never meant
to be rude to anybody. One of his first ap-
pearances was before Judge Casey. He was
so convinced he was right that his fervor
annoyed the old County Courtier, who mildly
remonstrated that that was hardly the way
for a junior barrister to talk. Starke had
been, comparatively, 24 hours at the Bar;
but he was quite ready to argue the point
with his Honor, and even question whether
that was quite the way for a County Court
Judge to talk to a barrister.
J.S. BRUNTON, the sporting miller.
From the Bar table: —
“Starkey’s” great ability is beyond all question,
and though it may take him a few years to forget
that he is no longer an advocate, he has all the
makings of a great judge, with 30 of service
ahead of him. If he does not catch the babbling
disease from his uncle-by-mariiage, he will be in
every way an acquisition: in any case he will cer-
tainly add to the strength of the Court. The
State has produced no finer Common Law man.
As Higgins is the patriarch of the High
Court Bench, so newly-appointed Starke (48)
is the baby. There are live Iv.C.’s on that
Bench—Knox and Rich (N.S.W.) ; Isaacs,
Higgins and Duffy (Vic.). Powers (Q.) and
Starke (Vic.) were stuffs.
Davey Hall will probably make a pretty
good Agent-General for N. S. Wales, so far
as any mere politician can. He is more
than an average speaker—he is one of the
very best for rough-and-tumble platform
work. Of economics he knows next to no-
thing : it was quite characteristic that when
the war started he announced that the
people’s motto should be “Spend! Spend !
Spend!”—the worst advice anybody could
have given. But it was popular, and because
bis old friend Dave has a good nose for
what is likely to be popular, Holman has
always liked to have him near. The friend-
ship of the two is one of the strange things
in N. S. Wales politics. Two men’s tastes
could hardly be more unlike: one loves to
do nimself well; the other, who is still a star
in his Little Bethel, is almost ascetic. Be-
fore he took to politics and read law with
David Ferguson, now a Supreme Court
judge, Hall was a clerk in the Lands De-
partment. He and Holman did their study
together.
J. H. Howe, just dead in Adelaide at 80,
came to South Aus. as a Scotch youth of 17.
He joined the mounted police at once, knew
McDouall Stuart as an explorer in the far
north, and was sent with another trooper,
Jenkin Coles, afterwards Speaker of S.A.
Assembly, to head off Gardiner, the bush-
ranger, from working down the river from
N. S. Wales into S. Australia. Howe was
always proud of having furnished informa-
tion, mostly gathered from blackfellows,
which guided Victorian relief expeditions to
Cooper's Creek to find the remains of Burke
and Wills. He succeeded old George King-
ston as member for Stanley in the S. Aus.
Assembly in 1881, and was hardly out of Par-
liament till he retired at the end of 1918.
He was Lands Minister twice under
Downer and Works Minister under Cock-
burn. He was never brilliant, but he was
tremendously solid; so much so that South
Aus. made him one of the team of 10 which
represented it in the Federal Convention of
1897. He leaves two sons, one in Queensland,
one in Westralia.
The two latest appointees to the Prince
of Wales’ staff are well known to many Aus-
tralians. Flag-lieut. Lord Louis Mountbatten
served on the China station before the war
(he was then Prince Louis Francis of Lat-
tenberg), and his elder brother Prince George
was here as a youthful lieutenant on the New
Zealand. In the tremendous re-shuffling of
Royal names which took place in the middle
of 1917 Prince George became an English
earl and his father a marquis, whereupon
Horatio Bottomley and the rest of the
Loyalists proclaimed themselves satisfied.
Lieut. Billyard Leake, the other addition to
the staff, won his D.S.O. at Zeebrugge, where
he was in command of the Iphigenia. His
mother was a Sydney heiress quarter of a
century ago, and he was here in pre-war
days as a tall, good-looking middy aboard
the Australia. Harefield, the family place,
just outside London, was an A.I.F. hospital
during most of the war. The Leakes rented
a house near-b.v and the only daughter nursed
in one of the Harefield wards. Young Leake
and Governor Newdegate of Tasmania are
having erected at Harefield Church an
obelisk in memory of the 110 Australians
who are buried in the local churchyard.
Wullie McGregor, ex-Governor of Queens-
land and other parts, left £35,812.
From the Federal lobbies :
The Speakership is not expected to be a walk-
over for Alligator Johnson; the advent of a
Farmers’ party with views of its own has made
even his re-election uncertain. It is alleged that
the Hayseeds can supply a Speaker if they can
get enough outside support, whilst the Nationalists
can put up two other candidates who could com-
mand a big vote in the House. The ancient Barn-
ford just missed the billet at the last selection, and
his personal qualities and long service would lift
him a long way towards the wig and gown. Chanter
also is a likely starter, but some unhappy decisions
as Chairman of Committees won’t help him with
the Labor party. In particular Dr. Maloney had
a historic argument with Chanter, and whenever
the little bundle of crackers thinks of it he still
feels explosive.
Northern Territory squatter Bill Lawrie,
whose death at 80 was reported last week,
landed in N. S. Wales when he was four, and
went with his parents to the Hunter. With
two brothers he hit out in ’62. for Rockhamp-
ton (Q.) with bullock-teams and horses.
After some years spent in carrying and
dealing, in ’7B brother Bill moved out on his
own for the Georgetown diggings with a load
of grog, and having successfully broken the
drought there decided to cross to the Terri-
tory, where rich gold finds were said to have
been made. He steered two teams into
Darwin in Christmas ’79, and was soon
stock-dealing and butchering. He gradually
acquired station properties and imported
some of the best stock , in the Terri-
tory. One of his latest purchases
was Elsey Downs, in conjunction with
another well-known pastoralist, Tommy
Sayle: but this was in 1915 sold to
the Thonemans of Vic. As he neared
the 80th post the old man’s health became
indifferent and death was welcomed. Though
he was as hard in a deal as any Scot can
be, big Bill Laurie had the bushman’s heart,
and leaves a multitude of friends throughout
the Commonwealth and the Straits Settle-
ments.
S. Australia’s new Governor Weigall is
related to the Duke of Wellington ; the Duke
was grand-uncle to Lady Rose, the Gov.’s
mother. The old warrior took a personal
interest in the province of S. Aus. when the
founders were at work on it. There was
dangerous opposition in the House of Lords,
but this was overcome by Wellington’s ap-
proval of the experiment in colonisation,
which, he thought, ought to have a trial.
Further, the Duke recommended his com-
panion-in-arms, Colonel Light, the farseeing
town-planner of Adelaide, to be the first
> Surveyor-General. Wakefield, who was the
author of the scheme of colonisation, urged
that the capital should be named Welling-
ton ; but there were toadies in those days,
too; and Wellington Square was the com-
promise. The new Governor’s father, an
artist who was responsible for much good
and bad work, painted a picture of the Duke
of Wellington when the old soldier had
reached 83.
Alfred Deakin’s executors have dropped
*l5OO into the State Treasury as probate
duty on the ex-Prime Minister’s estate.
William James Vowles, who has succeeded
the sick Macartney as leader of Banana-
land's Opposition, is, like the other, a lawyer.
He chases his six-and-eightpences in Dalby.
Ten or 11 years ago he made his first
attempt to supplant the then member, Joey
Bell, and failed; but when the other went
under to a sudden illness Vowles found the
track clear and rapidly came to the front
in a party where strong men don’t exactly
occur by the dozen.
A strange position has arisen in England.
The Lord Chancellor has climbed down from

movement. It is over
a century since a Lord
Chancellor did such a
thing as this. It was
Loughborough wh o
then was virtually
responsible for the
rejection oif Catholic
Emancipation and the
overthrow of Pitt.
Lord Birkenhead, who
was F. E. Smith, K.C.,
has never troubled
about the conventions
where political preju-
dice:- were concerned.
Just before the Great
War began he was a
member of Carson’s
burlesque “army of re-
bellion” in Ireland.
His father, by the
way, graduated at the
Bar after serving as
a ranker in the British
army.
Robert Steele, just dead in Adelaide, at
75, was a Scotchman who came to Australia
as a child. He started business as a mer-
chant, but presently specialised in insurance,
and made it his life’s work. Incidentally he
was Consul for Portugal, and chess cham-
pion at one time of S. Aus. Living in retire-
ment of late years, he has been represented
by half a dozen sons, mostly doctors, soldiers
and first-class cricketers.
Having done great things as a staff-officer
during the war General White has been
given the job of “organising” Edward’s visit.
He will deal direct with State Governments,
and see to it that the right people get in the
limelight. Each State will have the Princelet
for about a fortnight. Of course extrava-
gance is to be eschewed; it always is. And,
incidentally, being young, the Prince will be
allowed an occasional day or night off in
which to be merely Teddy.
Passed out, at 94, P. W. Chapman, born
in Princes-street, Sydney; his father was
then owner of a wharf property hard by—
subsequently it was known as Towns’s.
After getting some education at Sydney Col-
lege, now Sydney Grammar School, he went
with his parents to the Macleay River, where
several pastoral properties were secured.
The town of Frederickton was named after
Mr. Chapman, who later- removed to the
Clarence, where he engaged in the timber
trade.
Moses Barite, the little Manchester
Hebrew who mixes learned dissertations ou
giand opera with propaganda work for inter-
national socialism, recently dropped over to
Maonland to lecture under the auspices of
he Marxian Society. He was the first person
to discover the uses of M.L.’s new Undesk,
able Immigrants Act, and was promutlv
shipped back to the Commonwealth Now
Moses (shown above) is wondering whether
the Commonwealth Government will blow his
candle out, and, though unperturbed, he sus-
pects that he may see Manchester again
somewhat earlier than he anticipated. In
pre-war days he was widely known in Eng-
land and U.S.A. as a musical critic, and. did
regular work in this line for Manchester
papers, though not for the Guardian, as
alleged by a recent Bulletin contributor.
John Ross, A r ictorian apostle of co-opera-
tion and building-society promoter, whose
solid foundations were made of oatmeal
and milk at Kingussie in Kiltland, has closed
his books at last. The reckoning showed 87
years.
St. Peter’s School, Adelaide, starts the
year with a new headmaster, Julian Bicker-
steth, who in 1913 was chaplain at Mel-
bourne Grammar. By its constitution St.
Peter’s head must be an Anglican clergyman.
Otherwise it might have continued to do
well under Ainslie Caterer, who has carried
on with great success during the four years
since the retirement of Girdlestone.
Millen has denied that he aspires to be
President of the Senate. He seems to think
that a Minister naturalL wouldn’t do any-
thing of the sort. But Zeal left his place
in the Shiels Government to oecome Presi-
dent of Yic. Landlords. Pitt, more renowned
as a theatre-architect than as a politician,
relinquished an honorary Ministership to get
the job of Chairman of Committees in the
same chamber. And John Gavan Duffy had
a try for the Speakership after writing out
his resignation as Attorney-General. But
Ben; beat him.
There is a man in Suffolk, England, who
served in the Royal Albert in the Crimean
War, and still does a 15-mile bicycle ride
most days of the week. How much of the
credit of it is due to himself and how much
to Australia isn’t clear. Coming to South
Aus. in the later ’fifties this “Bob” Sayers
put in 30 years on the railways; then,
reckoning it was time he laid a bit by for his
old age, he went to Broken Hill and built a
pub which Was a sort of first-and-last to men
going on or coming off shift at the Big Mine.
After about 10 years miners’ thirst enabled
him to settle down in the land where he still
pushes a free wheel.
The idea of a Bush Week in Sydney origi-
nated with “Jacky” Moses, who has been
travelling the bush for many years on behalf
of a wine firm, and is an enthusiast on all
matters Australian. With characteristic
modesty “Jacky” disappeared from view as
soon as the organisation was properly
started.
“Blim’s” memory :
Brigadier-General Ramaciotti is off to Italy again,
the Commonwealth Government having, in the wary
official phrase, “accepted the offer of his services to
travel entirely at his own expense and investigate
in a purely honorary capacity.” The last time
“Rammy” re-visited his native land he investigated
its military system. So heavily primed did he be-
come with martial knowledge that when the Great
War began he was at once made a General and
shortly afterwards he got a C.B. He was the ideal
stage general. I was at George’s Heights in 1916
when he came there to inspect. The camp was full
of wounded Gallipoli men and the parades were
farcical. However, all hands were lined up for
“General Salute.” Just as the first notes of the
bugles rang out a blast went off in the quarry behind
us. The parade of ruins leapt about 3ft. in the air.
A couple of men limped hurriedly back to their
huts. But “Rammy” never blinked an eyelid. Stern
and erect he stood till the last notes died away, the
immemorial type of the true soldier. The Italians
won’t be able to teach him much about parade-ground
work.
HONI SOIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One morning on the esplanade
We met. A breeze was blowing.
She seemed embarrassed, half afraid
Some frillies might be showing.
But on the beach that afternoon
She sauntered by unshrinking-—•
Her costume nearly made me swoon ;
’Twould set La Milo thinking.
Next morning near the bathroom door
We met. She stammered “Oh!”
And scurried off. I knew wherefore—
She wore her kim-o-no!
That night behind her at the play
I sat. The show was fine —
She’d bared her back without dismay
Down to the Plimsoll line.
Ah! Lovely women can’t be blamed;
Iler clothes her moods attest.
Like Eve she only feels ashamed
When she is fully dressed!

Aikmau, the moderately-uew Mayor of

after they had given the greatest possible
testimony of the possession of the patriotism
which Deeper, Best and Worrall said they
lacked. When Aikman asked what assurance
would be given that his condition that no
offensive emblems should be displayed would
be observed, Buckley unclasped the Victoria
Cross from inside his coat lapel and offered
it. “his most treasured possession,” as a
pledge. “Buckley’s chance” has acquired a
new meaning.

About the most casual woman in Aus-

daily paper shouted the news. Some pub-
lished pnotographs of the infant. The police
took charge of him for a while, and then
with a certain amount of reluctance yielded
him up to the Benevolent Society. Four or
five days later the mother blew in, and
rather to the regret of the Benevolent offi-
cials removed him. For he also was engag-
ingly casual. He made no disturbance in
either the police station or the nome—just
smiled philosophically, fraternised with all
hands, and took whatever was offered in an
appreciative manner. “Give me a fair deal
and don’t deliberately spill my beer,” he used
to say. “and there will be no complaints
from this quarter.” He made this remark
with his eyes: he can’t speak yet.

Most of the Broken Hill unions are
branches of federations registered under the
Commonwealth Arbitration Act. * W. Le
Brun Brown, the Barrier S.M., gave them
a shock the other day when he decided that
lie could not deal with any
claims made by them in the
Small Debts Court. The Feder-
ated Engine Drivers’ and Fire-
men’s Association (Broken Hid
branch) struck a levy of 20 p.c.
on the earnings of all members
working, the money to be used
for “relief purposes.” Some
members refused to pay, with
the result that several were
sued for amounts averaging ti
each under clause 68 of the
Act. Brown dismissed the
cases with the remark, “A
branch of an organisation is not
registered under the Act, and
has consequently no power to
recover anything under the
Act. ’ In effect this means
(assuming it to be good law')
that if a branch wants to collect
from a recalcitrant member the
central organisation must take
out the summons and appear in
the Small Debts Court. Prob-
nbly this will be done. Free excursions
around the country for deserving union
officials seem to be the fasliion now.
“Macquarie-street” on chemists’ hours :
I disagree completely with “H. 0.” (B. 22/l/’2O)
as to the lack of business in pharmacists’ shops dur-
ing the evening hours; and I can go back 30 years.
From 1891 up to the outbreak of the war, in Sydney
suburban shops and a great many metropolitan ones,
especially those which catered for lodge patients!
the hours from six to nine p.m. were the busiest in
the week. Night after night, for more than 20
years, a well-known suburban dispensary was crammed
with people waiting to get their bottles and oint-
ment boxes filled. Also, in the private shops of
the same suburb these were the busiest hours, as all
our consulting work was done in the evening, general
ailments as well as the more difficult eye, ear, nose
and throat cases being attended to, and all the pre-
scriptions written out between 6 and 8 p.m. by
half a dozen doctors were dispensed the same night.
The laborer, the city clerk or the shopman couldn’t
get time off in the business hours to see about such
trifling things as blindness or deafness. And plenty
other people who had the leisure to consult a doctor
in daylight grudged the necessary time and put off
the interview until night. Consulting work was
thus crammed into a couple of hours, which was
bad for the patient, as he was usually polished off
in a few minutes, and it was simply Hell for the
medico, who had already put in 12 hours’ work. It
■was also burdensome to the chemist and his assist-
ants, who never knew what leisure was. In my day
as a general practitioner there never appeared the

slightest chance of ending this horrible slavery, but
the war started to do it, and the coming of the
cinematograph finished it. This reacted on the
pharmacists, who saw their night business falling oft'
to zero, and thereupon they agitated for an earlier
closing hour (7.30 p.m.). This innovation is bound
to do good, and will allow doctors to become
acquainted with their families and go to the play
occasionally. Reverently I thank God for the movies:
we wouldn’t have obtained this much-to-be-desired
reform without them.

“R.S.V.P.”: A ghastly fact has been dis-
closed by Mrs. Langridge, president of the
Women’s Hospital committee in Melbourne.
It is that, owing to lack of means wherewith
to treat inoperable malignant growths, last
year 20 cases were sent home from hospital
to die. Radium, in spite of many discourag-
ing results in the early stages of its use, has
for some time been found to produce excel-
lent effects, including many absolute cures,
in cases where the use of the knife has been
out of the question. One or two overnight
applications of a container holding a certain
quantity of radium, applied by an expert in
its use, have been enough in some cases to
set the patient on the road to health ; and
it is for lack of such facilities, the cost of
which is nowadays some £2OOO, that the
hospital was obliged to discharge its 20
hopeless patients. Under State control of
hospital finance, with the provision of cash
from Government revenues instead of from
intermittent and haphazard collections, such
a condition of affairs would be impossible;
but meantime Mrs. Langridge regrets that
“our previous appeal was not responded to
by the public, nor did it impress them of the
urgency of our needs.” Wherefore £2OOO
is wanted as soon as possible, from either the
public or the Government —whichever real-
ises its duty first.
* * * *
From the Federal lobby :
The recent grant of a bonus to the Parliamentary
staff will probably be discussed in the Reps.
Though the gift was prompted by high cost of liv-
ing, it varied according to the salary, with the
result that officers ranging from £5OO to £750
a year caught more than the cleaners and messengers
who are struggling to raise families on about £3
ss. a week. Though miserably treated, the menials
were, nevertheless, better off than three veterans of
the non-clerical division who got nothing at all.
The three aggregate over a century of service and
include an electrical engineer who after about 50
years of toil at the House has risen to £250 p.a.
The injustice to this man is, indeed, deepened
to insult by the fact that his assistant, whose
absence for months on sick leave has
doubled the chief’s duties, received a dole from
the Treasury. The Labor member who will ask for
explanations ought to draw' some useful infor-
mation.

‘•Rio” : Now that there is no disgrace in
serving in the ranks, for nearly all our offi-
cers have done so.
there is no reason why
junior officers con-
victed of military
offences should not fi'e
reduced to the ranks,
or to some non-
commissioned grade,
whence by good work
they might regain their
former status. The
present code in dis-
missing an officer from
the sendee loses us a
trained man, gives him
no chance of rehabili-
tating himself and
supplies a shirker offi-
cer with an easy way
out. Here also I would
point out that a citizen
officer “dismissed from
the service” is not
punished at all materi-
ally. In fact, he may
owe his life and health
to it. There are quite
a number in Australia
so punished who came
home, posed as heroes
and went back to their
civil wo r k in time
to get well ahead
(civilly) of their com-
rades still in the
trenches. Even to
those who knew some-
thing of the truth they
posed as victims of
some arbitrary, obso-
lete regulation. The
■regular officer similarly
punished is, however,
ruined, professionally
and socially; he is on
a par with a struck-otf
solicitor, though his
offence may have been a mild one.

An unfinished story comes
from Prahran (Vic.), where a widow with two
daughters let a furnished room to a young
man, who, according to the widow’s version,
unanimously supported by the daughters,
proved to be a nice, quiet, gentlemanly fel-
low, very reserved, and apparently possessed
of a settled sorrow. One evening, when the
lodger had been in possession about a fort-
night, a stranger called, and, giving a brief
description of the lodger, said: “You have
such a young man staying here'/” The
widow explained that the young gentleman
was then in his room upstairs. The caller
brushed past, saying, “I won’t trouble you.”
and ran up the stairs. He did not return
till late that night, and then he ran down
stairs, and let himself out. The widow, wffio
caught a glimpse of him, recognised him by
his light mackintosh. Nothing was heard of
the lodger that night, and as he had not put
in an appearance at eleven next morning
the widow investigated. She found a man.
whom she assumed to be her lodger, tied hand
and foot, gagged, and strapped to the bed.
On attempting to undo the prisoner she dis-

gregation, remember.”
covered to her amazement that the tied man
was not her lodger, but the unknown caller.
When this man was free he caught up his
hat and fled, offering no word of explana-
tion. The gentlemanly young lodger had
evidently lowered his portmanteau from the
window before scuttling down stairs in the
stranger’s overcoat. He has not returned,
and at this point the story drops through a
hole.

LOOKING UPWARD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Marsyas found the flute Athene had thrown away
while flying over Greece. A citizen (call him Bill
Smith) lately found a flask containing whisky,
reasonably suspected to have fallen from an aero-
plane.
It fell at my feet as the wind went by ;
In the wet, sweet grasses I saw it lie.
The wind blew west and the wind blew south
And I set the silver pipe to my mouth,
Making a music as shrill and fine
As the dream that floats in a bubble of wine.
The people went up and the people went down,
And they said it in church and they said it in town:
“What is the tune that lingers and stays
In the soul of a man when Marsyas plays?’.’
It fell at my feet as the wings went by;
By the new lawn-mower I saw it lie.
The winds blew north and the winds blew south
And I set the silver neck to my mouth ;
And baek-came tile music of old to me f 1
When I whistled a tune by the Grecian sea. '
The people went up and the people' came down
*nd a few flew over the roofs of t6.»u-+.
And I whispered it deep and I said it aloud:
“Lord, send more whisky out of the cloud!”
Athene is matched by the aeroplane—
Old and new' is the gracious rain.
Old is the whisky and new is the song;
And the winds blow light and the winds blow strong.
Marsyas once and Bill Smith now,
I stand with the weight of the sky on my brow;
And the people go up and the people come down;
And tile morn is green and the eve is brown ;
And always I stand by the garden wall
And wait and watch for something to fall.
Music and whisky I shall not dread,
But I fear that a spanner may fall on my head.

“Ex-dig”: Quite a number of Diggers
had a fancy for remaining in Blighty wnen
the war was over, and for months before the
armistice was signed applications poured in
for discharge in Britain. To discourage the
inclination the Defence Department gave in-
structions that discharges were not to be
granted unless the men concerned had (1) a
domicile outside Australia, (2) no dependants
in Australia or (3) had obtained the consent
of dependants to their discharge overseas ; and
i, 4) signed an undertaking releasing the Com-
monwealth from all claims, including the
obligation to return them to Australia. All
sorts of jobs were offered to A.I.F. men.
Apparently most of these have petered out,
or are not what they seemed, or a longing
for the place where fogs are scarce has come.
Anyway, it was in response to many appeals
1 hat the Commonwealth agreed to forget the
undertaking the men had made, and give them
passages; and the offices in London are be-
seiged by men who find that Australia is
home, after all, and that they want to get
there
THE MATRIMONIAL TRAP.
“Frank asked me bluntly last night how old
I was."
“But of course you didn't tell him!"
“Oh, yes, I did —I said I was twenty in the
spring.”
“R.A.Y.” : During the recent sugar short-
age at least one Bananaland mill met the
demand by turning out for direct consump-
tion a grade of raw sugar almost as good
as the refined article, and selling it at three-
fourths of the price of the latter. Some
20 to 30 years ago many small mills did like-
wise ; but latterly it has become the custom
for the mills to make only raw sugar of a
grade that requires refining and leaving
that job to the C.S.R. Co., which charges
about £7 per ton for doing it. At a cost
of a few shillings more per ton in the mills
the sugar could be improved to an attrac-
tive bright yellow or white grain suitable
for most purposes. This country curses the
C.S.R.; but if it said it wanted such sugar
as the mills could produce—quite as good a
food as the refined product—there are surely
plenty mills that w'ould supply the article.
That the C.S.R. is so fat is to that extent
our own fault.

“Coola’s” staff-colonel (B.
35/l/’2U) / with the brown-paper parcel of
souvenirs was asking for trouble. Most
officers going to Blighty
carried a suitcase which
w r as never examined at
the boat. Never an
Aussie went on leave
who was not loaded to
the hatband with
souvenirs. One sanguine
young subaltern stag-
gered aboard with the
parts of a German
“light” machine-gun in
his valise; and a Q.M.
“l’escued” the door of
Bapaume Church, took it
to pieces and got it
safely to Australia. But
Smithers easily won the
Souvenir Stakes. He
“salved” a large oak
chest from a battered
chateau and filled it with
Hun rifles, automatic pis-
tol s, field-glasses and
other bric-il-brac packed
in his winter clothing.
He sewed the whole up
in hessian, branded it
“Officer’s Surplus Kit” and
sent it off to the base.
Some months later he col-
lected it at the London
(Greyhound-road) Depot
intact.
“God Knows” : Only in
striving is there physical
life. With the ending of
all effort comes death.
Only in seeking know-
ledge is there mental life. Omniscience must
mean mental death. An omniscient God
would be a dead God. The living God must
have things still to discover and know. So
the logic of old creeds cracks at its weakest
joint; and there is room for a new theology
as adventurous as God Himself.
“Ecclesiast”: The war has freed Pales-
tine from the Turk and so made Zionism a
matter of practical politics. Sixty years
ago, when such a contingency was almost
unimaginable, Cardinal Manning argued
that the .Tews would presently go back, as a
nation, to Palestine. Also (1)
that anti-Christ would appear in
the New Jerusalem, and that he
would be a Jew, and (2) that this
would be “the prelude of the anti-
Christian period of the final de-
thronement of Christendom, and
of the restoration of society with-
out God in the world.” Lord
Curzon (Foreign Minister) re-
cently assured Lord Rothschild, as
representative of the Zionist
movement, that the British Gov-
ernment regarded its original
Zionist declaration as “the essen-
tial element in the pacification of
the world.” It is a truism that
Indifferentism and agnosticism are,
for some reason, increasing in the
Christian churches. As to the
third condition, the arrival of the
False Messias, Manning held that
he would probably appear during
one of those waves of spiritual-
ism which have passed over the
world at intervals, ever since the
Chaldean cast the first horoscope.
(Never has the spiritualistic cult
enjoyed such a boom as it is
experiencing to-day; and never
has it had such an intellectually
eminent band of adherents.) The
idea was that the bogus Messias
would be a medium and produce
the requisite “miracles” accord-
ingly. Manning deduced his conclusions
from the Scriptures and the writings of the
Early Fathers.

“Kopai” : There was a dramatic incident
at a Nationalist picnic in the Corio elec-
torate. An aviator was stunting for com-
mercial purposes in the district, and was
taking advantage of the picnic to do a little
advertising by conveying a “message” from
one small mayor to another smaller mayor.
The message had just dropped amid the awed
multitude, when a local party-manager rushed
forward, tore open the package, and, waving
aloft a missive, cried almost hysterically,
“A message from Mr. Hughes! Dropped
by the airman, just arrived from Mel-
bourne !” Then while the audience stood
spellbound, he read a lengthy screed telling
of sorrow for the Prime Minister’s non-at-
tendance, his wishes for the success of the
picnic, and how his spirit if not his body
would be with them. It was masterly, and
the sitting member felt he would go on sit-
ting for life! Only those near the platform
could see that the Prime Minister had writ-
ten his message on the back of a press tele-
gram form; and only the cynic pressmen
remembered the Prime Minister was not in
Melbourne and that the aviator had not
come from there. It was in this electorate
that a well-known prelate was let down
GLORIOUS CLIMATE.
“Haw, haw! Wonderful morning — can’t heat
pure mountain air
“I dunno. Once I took it with a little mil-
lionaire and — oh, it was a great im-
provement!”
badly over an alleged letter from Mr. Hughes
to one of his flock—denied with every sem-
blance of sincerity by the Prime Minister,
and afterwards forgotten by the prelate. The
cynics are now wondering whether an air-
man dropped that letter, too.

“Karim Khan”: Does any Bulletin
reader know of a longer route-march than
this? Early in 1918 our small advance-
party of the Dunsterforce strolled 607 miles
through the wilds of Persia, crossing on the
way three mountain ranges 4000, 5000 and
8000 ft high respectively, and numerous lesser
ridges. The journey occupied 46 days of
actual travelling, and when we reached our
destination mv second pair of boots were
worn so thin that I could have rolled cigar-
ettes in the soles of them if I’d had any
tobacco.
* * * *
“Ray”: The N. S. Wales Commissioners
some months ago discontinued the practice
of printing the fares on the railway tickets
issued to passengers on Sydney suburban
lines. Since then the price of tickets has
been altered on two or three occasions.
After the figures were expunged from the
ticket the only guide a purchaser had to
the right fare was the alphabetical list of
stations hung outside the booking-office. Now
these lists are disappearing, and a traveller
is at the mercy of the clerk inside the
office. I bought a ticket on Monday of last
week at Bankstown for Sydney and was
charged Is. On the Wednesday follow-
ing the journey cost me Is. The same
Wednesday afternoon I bought four tickets
at Parramatta for Bankstown for 6s. 2d., or
Is. each—for a trip that is 14 miles
longer than from Bankstown to Sydney.
Surely both public and public revenue are
entitled to some safeguard from profiteering
or blundering booking-clerks.

Twenty-four hours in the Northern Ter-
ritory :
The train from Darwin to Pine Creek was made up
of two carriages, ten trucks and an engine. There
were 22 of us in the compartment—the Territory’s
usual mixed assortment of Britishers, Greeks,
Italians, Russians, Swiss, Swede 3, half-castes and
Chinese. Every mother’s son had a bottle or a case
of grog. “ ’Ave a drink ?” was the password. No
one declined ; it wasn’t manners and it was the only
way to avoid arguments. A couple of the sundries
got fresh and had a go-in 'at one end of the carriage.
As the combatants worked from the original scene of
action other occupants shifted out to the platform
at the rear of the carriage or on to the footboard to
give them room. The guard, coming along for
tickets, spoilt the show by promising to throw the
grog out unless there was an improvement in pre-
vailing conditions. All hands had a drink then and
declared that the guard wasn’t a bad sort of poor
. Not one bottle was left as, after 9J hours
(the journey is 146 miles), the train drew into the
Creek, for the traveller scorns to be seen carrying
a perceivable drop away with him. That night at
the pub the same congregation lined up at the bar
• —all had had a feed and were as thirsty as ever.
At 2 a.m. the roysterers were on the jag in their
rooms. At 8 a.m. they were still thirsty, filling up
for the train journey to the Katherine and getting
a fresh supply of bottle goods. Not a man missed
the caravan and at the journey’s end not a man had
a bottle left. Three hours saw the lot finished.
Twenty-four hours later all hands had drifted into
the bush, perhaps not to meet again in civilisation
for months or years—perhaps never—and they took
no booze on their journey. It couldn’t be got.

“J.M.S.”: When a donkey was buried in
France, the A.I.F. planted a wooden warn-
ing notice, “Foul Land,” over the spot. A
mob of .Diggers one day marched through a
shattered village, struck the ruins of a cellar
and hauled a couple of cases of champagne
out of the wreck. They drank one case and
the other they buried with a “Foul Land”
placard above it. Next night they met some
Tommies. “Come and have a drink, chooms,”
they said; and they dug up the case and
distributed a dish of the froth to each. Then
they explained to the Tommies that every
“Foul Land” placard thereabouts covered a
curse of champagne. Next night choking
curses were heard as the Tommies dropped
their shovels and grabbed their hoses.
“Wessel”: A favorite opium-smuggling
dodge years ago in the . North was to put
the stuff in a tin and throw it overboard
when the steamer was passing the Vernon
Islands on her way eastward from Port Dar-
win. Chinese sampans used to put out from
the islands and pick up the goods. Some-
times the tin was missed. In days when
the blackfellows of Melville Island were
much less sophisticated than they are now a
kerosene tin full of opium drifted ashore
on the island. The only use Black Brother
could think of for the sticky stuff
was to rub it on the outside of his canoes
as a kind of substitute for pitch. When
the news got to Darwin someone was soon
over in a motor launch to see what he could
scrape off. but it wasn’t much. Nowadays
there aren’t any Chinese sampans about the
Vernons, nevertheless the opium gets in all
right.

“McNorth”: The Mission of the Sacred
Heart has done a lot of good, practical work
in opening up a portion of inland Papua.
From the headquarters at Yule Island, G. r >
miles north-west of Moresby, the priests and
lay brothers have pierced far into the cloud-
wrapped heights of the little-known moun-
tains- directly opposite. Despite enormous
difficulties, and without Government assist-
ance, they built a road that it takes 10
days to traverse. This track climbs other-
wise impossible gradients, sidles up tower-
ing. jungle-clad ridges, threads up and down
and in and out the chaotic welter of peaks
and spurs that is the chief characteristic of
far-inland Papua. It took years of per-
sistent effort to accomplish, and as an en-
gineering feat represents something consider-
able—the mere finding and surveying of a
serviceable track through such a tangle was
a wonderful thing in itself. But that nar-
row track shines chiefly as an example of
the fact that these pioneering missionaries
SHE REMEMBERED A THING
OR TWO.

habited it is possible that they have a
wireless strong enough to talk to us
quite clearly .”
THE MAID: “ Goodness, I hope they haven't
a telescope as strong."
had realised that means of communication
and transit are the first requirements of
progress. Perhaps the purpose of carrying
complicated civilisation to the simple-minded
natives of the interior was a wrong one;
but even so the Government of Papua may
learn a lesson from the Mission of the Sacred
Heart. The road-makers are the true
pioneers.
MAGNANIMOUS MANLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Mayor of Manly said that certainly he would
invite the Prince of Wales to come to Manly on
the occasion of his visit to Australia.”
Cover the Corso with confetti, sweep the beaches,
paint the jetty,
Decorate with flags prolific half a mile of the Pacific,
Whilst above the festal main Sydney Pickles’ aero-
plane,
Strung with bunting, madly stunting, loops wild
loops across the Steyne.
Let the Surf Club, bare of torso, prance in posses
down the Corso,
Or, arrayed as gladiators, quell innocuous spectators!
Let the sirens of the board dance in frolicsome accord
With the Pierrots and surf-heroes of a masquerading
horde!
Let the Doges of the city meet in dignified com-
mittee,
And adjourn, upon a motion, to a banquet by the
Ocean,
Where the Mayor, by lure of wine and mock-turtle
by the brine,
May inveigle a Vice-Regal representative to dine!
Then, by municipal bounty, unsurpassed within the
county,
Let the meeting, in addition, post a ticket of admis-
sion
To the Prince (complete with Crown) in the solitude
of town,
Or the gloom of his room on the H.M.S. Renown.

Challenge the Studebaker!
IF your experience has equipped you
to appraise adequately the merits of
of a car—if it has made you a
competent critic —tabulate a list of the
attributes that you would look for when
buying a car. If you lack that essential
knowledge get an unbiassed expert
opinion. Then, with your list in hand,
challenge the Studebaker!
Check up your demands against the
Studebaker Special Features below. You
will find that the answers returned will
be satisfying to the most censorious
examiner. More, you will find that there
will be, probably, a surplus of good
points embodied in the Studebaker over
and above those which any reasonable
man will demand.
And, even then, the record of Special
Features will tell you nothing of the
fine, physical luxury that Studebaker
riding affords. It mentions naught of
that splendid responsiveness—like the
lightning action of a high-mettled
thoroughbred—which is a Studebaker
characteristic. There is no direct refer-
ence to the economy with which a
Studebaker uses up its petrol and wears
out its tyres.
But if you will call at any Studebaker
centre or on any Studebaker dealer
you will find these important qualities
readily demonstrable. Any Studebaker
representative will take a strong, personal
interest in your visit. There will be no
importunity to buy.

EDITORr: “ Why do you persist in sending in
these long letters with your contribu-
tions?”
ASPIRANT: “I e r-didn't want you to think I
was doing them just to annoy you.”
“Yenda”: I won’t say that this is a world-
beater, but how do you like it? Pal and self
crowded it into an 8 it-hour day. With a “forest
devil” we pulled 67 trees, none of which had been
grubbed. Fifteen were green pine stumps averaging
about 2ft. 6in. in diameter (five of them we had to
partly grub ourselves) ; five were box-trees about
4ft. in diameter, and the remainder were green and
dead pines. We worked five anchors, covered an area
of about five acres and used only one set of ropes.
“Sassafras”: The best rain-prophet in
Australia is the white ant. I have studied the in-
sect’s habits for the last 20 years, and have never
known its tips to fail. When the bountiful rains fell
in Bananaland on New Year’s Day, marking the
breaking of the drought in that region, the white-
ant was busy a week beforehand building additions
to his mansion, and a day before the rain fell he
knocked off, closed his windows and stayed inside.
The same thing happened in the 1901-3 drought.

“Pongo” : “Tharon” (B. 8/l/’2O) is right
in denying “Pick’s” assertion that the abo.’s nulla-
nulla when thrown is
canoned off trees or the
ground. Nulla throwers
I’ve met have always tried
the direct hit. The abos.
of my acquaintance made
the weapon from the butt
of a vellow-wood sapling—
simply the base of the tree
rounded a bit at the bot-
tom and fined away until
it was about }in. in
diameter at the handle
end. The genuine nulla of
former days was a much
larger implement. They
were about 2ft. long,
pointed at the business
end, and suddenly bulged
until about 4iin. down
they were bin. in diameter.
They then diminished until
near the hand-grip they
were about fin. in
diameter, and had a swell-
ing at the end, obviously
to afford a good hand-
grip. This nulla-nulla was
made of yarran wood, and
was very smooth and
nicely balanced. I’ve seen
an abo. throw a small
nulla and domino a bunny
30yds. distant; but he
couldn’t do it every time —not nearly every time.
“A. E. Cavill” : Twelve months ago Lance
Skuthorpe was in the Clermont district (Q.) catch-
ing brumbies. This is how he went about it. He
first shot an old-man kangaroo and carefully skinned
him. Then, having located the waterplace of the
brumbies, he built, about 100yds. from it, a strong
sapling yard, with a good strong wing running up
from the water. On the opposite side of the hole
he built a small mia-mia. The work took about four
weeks to complete, and Lance always had the kan-
garoo skin ready to don when any of the brumbies
came along. Then, one morning just at daylight,
down came about 30 head of fine-looking horses.
They had just got to the water when Skuthorpe hop-
ped out dressed in the ’too skin yelling a treat. The
terrified prads went helter-skelter up the wing into
the yard with Lance behind them. He trapped the
whole 30 and paddocked them. Next week lie got
another 50, and now has 80 head of the nicest bush
horses you could wish to own.
* * * *
“Black Pearl”: With the big increase in
the selling-price of trochus and beche-de-mer, the
Torres Strait islanders are on a fairly good wicket,
where they’re working on their own account. Trochus
is now close up to £lOO a ton and pays ever so
much better than copra-making, though this pro-
duct, too, is going up in price steadily. Some of
the pearling boats complain that they
can’t now so readily obtain crews, but
this is because the Strait native doesn’t
see any points in working on wages of
which three-fourts are kept back by the
Department until he is paid off —which
means that he runs into debt during
the year to buy the necessaries for the
family at home—when he can get much
bigger returns, be independent, and have
ready money when he wants it by work-
ing on his own. The Department, unfor-
tunately, does not seem to encourage the
development of home industries, preferring
to have the men signed on to luggers on
wages and keeping them away from home
for anything up to 12 months. It is
doubtful whether this is in the best
interests of the natives. At present there
is no systematic attempt to develop the
agricultural resources of the islands, the
people having been encouraged to depend
largely upon “white man supplies” of
flour, rice, etc. Possibly this will right
itself in time. Still, a country that
doesn’t encourage home-production so far
as its white citizens are concerned can
hardly be expected to give a lead to the discolored
part of the population.
* * * *
“U.P.”: Canaries are frequently seen
flying around the Adelaide suburbs these days. On
account of the high price of birdseed (canary seed
is Is., Id. per lb., and very little to be had) many
people have liberated their pet warblers. Australian
supplies of canary seed in pre-war days came from
Turkey. When that market closed the increased
price allowed Queenslanders to grow at a profit, and
they Supplied Australia, but this season the crop
has failed, and the result is a famine. It is doubt-
ful whether the birds, after generations of captivity,
will thrive at large. If they do it isn’t certain
they will be a welcome addition to our flocks
and herds. Possibly they may cross with the
sparrows; they certainly do in captivity.
“Hay”: I came across in the early ’seven-
ties a Finke River abo. who would easily have passed
tor a genuine African negro. His lips were thick
and his hair was all-wool in texture and curled close
to his head. How such a type of nig. appeared
among an inland tribe, a thousand miles from the
coast, was a pufczle to me. We called him “Lazy
Charlie” and he answered to it when he wasn’t too
tired. His abo. name was Meetroo Tahtoo, which
means “sleepy-head.” He did no hunting, but lay
about and slept while the rest of the tribe, who
seemed to regard him as an object of veneration,
handed him a share of 'their game.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: Outback Australian
cooks and their offsiders have something to learn
from the South American “poisoner.” When an
animal is slaughtered the S. American cuts the
greater part of the lean meat into strips and dries
it instead of dumping it into pickle or a dry salt-
ing trough. The remainder of the flesh, lanced into
handy junks, is made into an asado or puckero, the
former usually from the ribs and loin cuts. The
meat is first sprinkled with pepper and salt, a few
jabs are made with the cook’s cuchillo and a grain
of garlic inserted in each slit. Then the joint is
threaded on a piece of stiff wire or a green stick
and toasted by the embers of the camp fire. Where
vegetables are procurable puckero is on the menu at
least once a day. A lump of meat from the rougher
cuts is dumped into a camp kettle with a liberal
supply of cold water, brought to boil and allowed to
simmer until the bones come away freely. Then
onions, carrots, spuds, sweet bucks, green bananas,
pumpkin (cut in slabs with the rind left on), green
maize and scraps of cabbage are added, and the
mixture is boiled until soft. The soup from the pot
is served, followed by the meat and vegetables, a
hunk of bread and half a litre of cheap, dry wine.
A very delicate puchero is occasionally made from
poultry. When fowl is used the dish is called
cazuela. The ordinary puchero is made from eithe
beef or mutton. Beef is preferred, as the soup
has more body in it. An asado properly done make>
a feed worth going after, but the puchero with a
good assortment of vegetables and the clioclo flavor
is mighty hard to beat. I have eaten puchero at
least three times a week for years, and asado almost
as often, and 1 strongly advise Australian poisoners
to cut out the salt horse and the frying-pan and
acquire the puchero and asado habit in the interest
of palate, health and pocket. There is another dish
much used in S. America in cases of emergency.
When a peregrinating Uobernador or linghera strikes
a wayside pub on one of the rare meatless days, he
is served, soon after his first long-sleever, with a
c-hook neatly split up the back and grilled with a
sprinkling of red pepper. The chicken had been
grabbed, its neck twisted, the carcase plunged into
boiling water, the feathers peeled off with the skin,
the innards drawn, the body toasted, and the bird
set before the hungry' pilgrim. This is called a
rapido. Then there is the Bolivian’s favorite dish,
cazuelu de yato (cat), but this is enough to go on
with.
“Hastings” : Does- any Abp. know of an
instance similar to this? In New England (N.S.W.)
I found the nest of a little green bird, much like u
silver-eye, but slightly bigger, and known locally as
a “twitter.” In it were two white eggs and a dark
green one precisely similar in shape and size to
the other two. I feel certain the same bird laid
all three, eggs. For four consecutive years I
found the nest within a radius of about a quarter of
a mile, and every time it had, along with others,
one green egg. I have never known of another
instance where the eggs of these birds were not all
white.
* * «• ♦
“J. Whiteside”: Can’t agree with “Leo
Lear” that the death of so many barn-owls is due
to the starling. Some time ago 1 found half a
dozen dead owls about- the haystacks, all emaciated
and with plumage much ruffled. Later, coming on
one in a dying condition, 1 made a careful examina-
tion and found the head and body covered with tiny
punctures, around which the flesh had mortified. Th ■
punctures had the appearance of shot wounds. When
this bird died 1 was much surprised to see small
white grubs issuing from the holes about the head;
also from the ears, mouth, beak and nostrils. These
parasites, I am informed, infest the stomach of the
bird, making their way thence through the whole
body, but I won’t gamble on the correctness of the
information. A bald-headed man gave it to me.
“Bill II.”: On Mona.ro (N.S.W.) one sec-
tion of the community does not welcome the breaking
of the drought. Along the Cathcart swamps the
pigs have had the time of their lives rooting out the
eels from the mud bottoms of waterholes. The
SUPERLATIVE DEG REV.
“Colder ’n this down in town, Grice?”
“My oath it wus —two blankets colder!"
wrigglers left no apparent holes when burrowing for
moisture, but that did not worry the pigs who, in
gangs, took the creek beds in a face from bank to
bank, and b,y increased energy when rearing a find
proved that they could scent the eels through layers
of mud and rotting reeds.
“FY7” : The prad mentioned in a recent
Bulletin by “Zabo” as • having caught its hind
shoe, in the bell-strap and perished miserably has
had many brethren in affliction. A common accident
is the catching of a hind-shoe in a stirrup while
kicking forward at flies on a girthgall. Another is
the hooking of the lower teeth or bit into the iron
while biting at the same annoyance. Always throw
your stirrups over the saddle when leaving your
prad in fly time, or run them up to the top of the
leathers. While I was riding on the metal road by
the canal at Ivantara, my mount, just off the Sinai
desert after six months in the soft sand, did a long,
slithering stumble, almost coming down. As he
came up standing on three legs, with his head
down, I dismounted. The curb-chain hook on the
bit had been forced into the off-knee joint on the
inside; and it took a hard pull to drag it out. Ned
had a straight leg next day, but was fit enough a
month after, when the regiment went back to work.

A MESSAGE FROM THE MULGA.
TO THE BULLETIN.
Dear Sirs, —1 feel I want a change,
So I am coming down,
And 1 will want a place to camp
While 1 am in the town.
I think I’ll bring my tent and things
That 1 use on the track,
And wonder now if you’d object
If I camped round the back.
I’m also taking down my dog—
I’ve reared him from a pup—
But if there’s poison laid about
I’ll have to chain him up.
I think you’ll And he’s pretty good
When strangers are about,
And he will watch that you’re not robbed
When everyone is out.
My tent is only six by eight—
It won't be in the way;
And one of you could camp with me
If you should care to stay.
And I could yarn about the bush;
■The change would do you good.
(1, s'pose there’s water handy there
And I can find some wood.)
I trust there is a store close by—
A general store, I mean—
Where I can deal while 1 am camped
Behind the Bulleteen ;
And I suppose that I can get
Some bread each second day—
I’ll cut out baking while I’m there;
The fire might get away.
You’ll find I’m not a lazy bloke ;
I’ll always lend a hand
To chop the wood or feed the horse—■
The jobs I understand.
I’ll see that people shut the gate
Throughout the night and day;
I’ll feed the fowls and gather eggs
If you should be away.
But if you think by camping there
I’d make your neighbors scoff,
Or if their women-folk might talk—
Well, then, the trip is off.
So let me know to stay or go
(1 won’t get on the spree),
And, shine or rain, I will remain
Yours ever faithfullee,
N.S.VV.

‘•Bill Bow-yang”: Binglii told me this
legend as we sat in the beche-de-mer camp on
Warrior Island (N.Q.). Yaeka, a very small man
and a great traveller, came to an island within the
Barrier Reef and saw a gunyah which belonged to
four brothers named Yungl, Wylo, Yowai and Yancoo.
JUST THE MAN.
“Well, how are things in the Art World?”
“ Booming, old man! Chap called yesterday
—wants me to paint his wife very
badly.”
“Win, right into your hands, Dauber.”
Yacka went to them and said: “This gunyah belongs
to me: you must get out.” The brothers replied,
“No; the gunyah is ours. Who are you and where
do you come from?” All hands argued for a long
time, and at last the brothers agreed that if the
little man could guess their names they would go
away and let him have the place. As soon as this
was agreed upon the dwarf disappeared. But he had
not gone far. Beside the gunyah was a tree which
he had climbed, and peering through the leaves he
lowered a spider upon Yungl’s forehead. Yungl’s
brothers called out, “Yungl, there’s something crawl-
ing on your forehead!” So the dwarf knew the name
of that one. Then he dropped the spider on the
heads of each of the other brothers, and the name
of the man on whom the insect rested was called in
warning. When the dwarf had thus learned the
names of all the brothers he slipped down the tree
and re-entered the gunyah. “Your name is Yungl,”
he said ; “your name is Wylo; your name is Yow'ai;
and your name is Yaneoo.” When the brothers saw
that the dwarf knew all their names they went
away in their canoes, and left Yacka in possession
of the gunyah.

“Hastings”: “Jim Carew’s” description
(B. 8/l/’2O) of a fight between two native bears
reminds me of a go I saw between two hardcase
scrub wallabies. They fought amongst rocks and scrub
in holts and out of ’em. After each round they
stood off a few yards and then rushed in again, kick-
ing and biting for all they were d—n well worth.
How long the lash-up would have lasted I dunno,
but as I was after skins I could not resist having a
shot. I missed both of them and the next minute
I couldn’t see them for dust. Speaking of native
bears, I remember that in 1890 two of us counted
from the verandah of a house in the main street of
a New England border township 200 of the little
fellows. Yet when - I was in New England recently
I was told by several shooters that a bear now is a
rarity.

“Wessel”: Jack Johnson, a Norwegian at
Darwin, who lived over on Bathurst Island for a
while, once noticed in the hands of an abo. there
a tomahawk roughly made from a piece of iron,
but on the model of the old stone axes, and fastened
to a handle in the good old palaiolithic way. He was
told that long ago, before the first British settle-
ment in Northern Australia was founded (that was
in 1824, at Fort Dundas, on Melville Island), a
vessel went ashore on the northern side of Bathurst
Island, and that the iron of which the tomahawk
was made came from the wreck. The story ran
that several of the crew landed, built huts, made a
garden and lived there for some time. No one
would tell Johnson what became of them, but, judg-
ing from the old-time reputation which the Bathurst
Island abos. shared with those of Melville Island,
they were probably eaten.

“E.S.S.”: While Richmond and Tweed
dairymen and Government demonstration farms in
that locality are experimenting with imported grasses,
why don’t they give a chance to the fine natives
of the interior, such as Mitchell, Flinders and blue
grasses? There is none superior to Mitchell. When
dry it is a natural hay. Out west it is cut on the
plains, and at many homesteads it is the only hay
and chaff used for stable feeding. Tyson had a stack
at one of his homesteads which was left untouched
for 20 years and was then good and sweet. Efforts
should be made to spread this vegetable wherever
it will grow, as it is relished by all kinds of stock
and even the dry blades, licked up off the ground-
in drought times, are fattening.
HE MIGHT MENTION IT LATER.
THE PASSENGER : “Consume much lubricant
on a long-distance flight?”
THE PILOT: “Nothing up to a 200-mile non-
stop. Then my thirst gets the better of
me.”
“Dusty Folio”: There does not seem to
be any evidence that the telescope on Yorke Island
mentioned by “Friday Island” (B. 18/12/’l9) ever
really belonged to La Perouse. But if it did there
would be no need to bring La Perouse to Yorke
Island to account for it. The original owner, Ned
SO MIND THY OWN BUSINESS.
FIRST COUSIN: “Where 't 'ee goin'—up
township?”
SECOND COUSIN : “No, I aren't goin' there
or nowhere else; I'm goin' 'ome.”
Mosby, commonly known as .Yankee Ned, probably
brought it with him from the South Seas. About
1876 Ned was one of the crew of a Yankee whaler
somewhere down about Lord Howe Island. There
was a mild mutiny, an unpopular officer was cracked
over the head, and for his offence Ned was marooned
on a desert island for three years. Then, after
knocking about the South Seas for a while, he
drifted up to Torres Strait and settled on Yorke
Island. The abos. there were very wild when he
first blew in, and he had to become one of them and
join in their ceremonies and so forth. He married
a native woman and had four sons, all big, strapping
fellows over six feet, who are still living on Yorke ,
Island. In his later days Mosby made some money
as a pearler, and his soils still carry on the business.
They are well known at Thursday Island. The late
Frank Jardine used to have a couple of old-time
relics at his place at Somerset, Cape York—two old
brass cannon fished up on the Barrier Reef. One
Christmas, when he had a house-party of visitors
from Thursday Island, some fool nut too much
powder in one of the guns and blew it to pieces.
The other is still there. As far as I know no one
has attributed it to La Perouse. Maybe it came from
one of the Spanish wrecks alleged to have blown
into Torres Straits in the old days, but there is
nothing to prove it.
“R.A.Y.”: The 15-year-old negro-head
fence-posts at Dorrigo (N.S.W.) mentioned by
“Delhi” (B. 8/l/’2O) are away behind in the race
for the Durability Stakes. In fences of bloodwood
and ironbark erected thereabouts 40 years ago most
of the original posts and rails are still sound. In
a half-mile line of ironbark fence erected 30 years
ago to Works Department specification, not a single
rail or post has decayed. Buildings on the N.S.W.
North Coast roofed with bloodwood shingles, some
of them only a quarter-inch thick, have remained
weatherproof for 40 years.

“C. Coral” : A little while ago I had to
settle a small disagreement between a couple of
Torres Strait islanders. The trouble having arisen
because of a lady’s infidelity, the aggrieved hus-
band, referring to his clemency in the matter (he
had simply ordered the wife to pack up and get
out), declared: “I no been like white man. T tell
that woman, ‘S’pose I do all same white man, I
. take gun and shoot you!’” Asked for his authority
for the white man’s alleged procedure in such
cases he replied: “I been see that one along
pixishers. Plenty white man he do that.” The
old native method in cases of adultery, by the
way (though such cases were not frequent), was
for the husband of the erring one to spear her on
the legs or arms and send her packing. In the
case of a husband being the offender, apparently
retribution came from a pourri-pourri man employed
by the relatives of the injured party. It was
usually pretty effective.
“MeNorth”: Western Papua is the flattest
country I know'. From Cape Blackwood, the westei n
boundary of the Gulf Division, to the Dutch border,
the country behind the beaches is for many days’
journey as level as a windless sea. Much of it is
dense sago marsh and malodorous mqngrove swamp,
with hooped surface roots
that make travelling a
weariness; but here and
there are strips of drier
land. Except in flood-time
and at low tides the enor-
mous rivers that wander
drunkenly down from the
far interior and cut the
flat-lands into ribbons are
salt for long distances
above their moiiths, the
tides forcing back the slow-
moving fresh water till it
spills over the alleged
land. Sailing along the
coast the seaman’s onlv
indication of the shore is
a low, dark line- along the
horizon —a line which,
owing to its lack of
elevation, is really much
closer than it seems. Pick-
ing up the mouth of a
river is the devil’s own
job; the opening doesn't
show against the everlast-
ing sameness of the back-
ground of mangroves at
any distance, and there
are no distinguishing geo-
graphical features from
which to get a bearing.
In the whole great country
there is but one hill—
Mabaduan, a knob west-
ward of the Fly River. It
is a useful landmark, but
is too low to be seen any
great distance; but away
across the swamj>-lainds, on
fine, clear mornings before
the trade-wind clouds have
blotched the sky, there
sometimes appears a faint
blue-and-white line. The charts say nothing of it,
and .the white man’s reason may tell him that his
eyes are mistaken ; but the natives will whisper that
it is the Great Unknown- —the Snow Mountains of
Dutch New Guinea.
“Mimosa” : I agree with “Centurion” (B.
8/l/’2O) that the spell in Egypt helped, the Aus-
tralian war horses to make good. Comparisons can-
not be made between this last show and the South
African scrap. Australian horses in this stunt were
solid inside, having been fed on good Australian
chaff and oats, whereas in the South African mix-up
they landed after being fed in many cases upon
musty compressed fodder. In S. Africa chaff
was an unknown quantity and the maize
(South American) was inferior. And the prads were
at all times short of tucker. “Centurion” loses
ground as an authority when he states that many of
the horses of the British regiments, such as the
Westminster Dragoons and the Indian Cavalry, had
also long spells in Egypt. The Westminster mounts
were picked by this scribe, firstly, from horses that
had already two years in India in the Cavalry service.
Originally they came from Australia.
“Crock Digger”: Th-e adjutant in charge
of the Salv’army squad in a West Queensland village
sent Jacky round with the tambourine, and that
was the last he saw of him for two or three weeks.
When black brother returned to the fold the
adjutant demanded to know where the “collection”
was. Jacky looked paralysed. “By cripes,” he
gasped; “you been takem collection plenty time,
me only takem one time. Mine thinkit my turn
some time.”

Mary Gilmore wonders what’s coming:—
In the sink this morning I found one of those
long-legged, whirligig, spectral things which some
people call daddy-long-legs. I don’t know its name,
but it wasn’t a spider. Hating to drown it I tried
to pick it up by its “ends.” It left them behind
it and ran on, hopelessly, though I got it out later.
The point is this: These legs continued to live.
They curled and uncurled on their own account for
nearly two whole minutes (a long time in the life
of so fleeting a creature), and for another minute
they moved at a touch. I should say they lived as
long as a hen with her neck screwed, but not as
long as one with her head cut off (an argument in
favor of hanging as against beheading!). The lift
in things that have no longer any business to be
alive reminds one that mother’s milk is the most
alive of all foods, even counting the nourishing
oyster ; that underdone meat is ordered for debility ;
and that the incubated baby in France, as soon as
strong enough, draws straight from the groat. Also,
the eater of living food has the finest offspring and
the soundest bone; and, separating again, the car-
nivorous animals proportionately to size and activity
have the greatest strength and endurance (animals
that endure on their fat or on the yolk in their
fleeces to be differentiated).
In view of all this, what effect is the dead food
of cold storage going to have on humanity ? —dead
meat in particular. What would be the effect on
the third generation of dogs fed on storage meat
as compared with the third fed on the freshly-
caught and still very much alive? (One would have
to go to the third generation at least to counteract
the natural heredity of a million generations living
on the freshly killed.) I hear someone mention the
crocodile and his buried meat. He buries it till it
is full-living with the germs of putrefaction—a
sort of secondary life. I also hear someone mention
the Japanese. The Japanese, and most of the
small-boned -‘Eastern;;,” live on fresh vegetables
along with fresh milk, eggs and fish, when they can
get them. Their rice is seldom last year’s. Tin-
Japanese soldier going on long trek and forced
endurance in modern war (more strenuous than old)
is fed on meat. The big-framed Mohammedan of
India and elsewhere is a meat-eater; the fine-boned
Hindu a vegetarian.
(Mem.: Feed one cat on birds and mice and one
on elephants and oxen to see if the latter would
become a large-animal-eating lion!)
In fine, constriction and poverty of food mean
constriction and poverty of human frame-quality;
generosity of living-content (or life-content) and
plenty in food give size and stability—exercise and
other things being added to keep strength walking
instead of sleeping. (A platitude; but let it go!)
So we come again to our text, remembering that
cold storage has come suddenly all over the world
to mankind: What effect is the dead meat of cold
storage going to have on humanity, at all events
till that accommodating body fits itself to new con-
ditions ?

“Gelt”: The New Britain (Blanche Bay)
native has a peculiar custom of not mentioning his
own name or the name of the person to whom he is
speaking, but always alludes to “mauraqu” (mv
namesake) or “mauram” (your. namesake). This
custom is especially noticeable on the mission sta-
tions, where there is a great run on biblical names,
such as Joseph, Elias, Moses, etc. Any similar
custom in other islands?
“Barcoo”: Somebody asked recently how
Frank Gardiner, ex-bushranger, ended his days.
He was shot in the “joint” that he ran in ’Frisco
after lie got away from Australia. He had some of
the worst toughs around him in his saloon that a
man would wish to dodge, and it appears that one
of the gunmen lobbed him in a “ready” because he
(Gardiner) was suspected of slipping information to
the Police Department in return for concessions in
regard to his license.

“45”: Why go to the,expense of procuring
unslaked lime for de-hairing hides, as recommended
by some Abos. ? The ashes from your fire, holding
lime in plenty, do the trick just as well. Spread

fold, leave for a week or so, tpen out, scrape, and
there’ll be no entries in the complaint book.

MISS MUFFET : “I say, porter, how long do

“D.F.”: In his “Birds of Australia”
Mathews included amongst our extinct species the
parrot variously known in the vernacular as the
scarlet-shouldered, ground, elegant, or anthill parrot
and blessed with the scientific name of Psephotus
pulcherrimus. There seems to be evidence, however,
that a few stray specimens of this once not un-
common bird, one of the most beautiful of our
parrots, still survive in the coastal districts of
Queensland. Probably this will not be the case for
long. There is hardly a doubt that the night parrot
of South Aus. is extinct. Keen collectors and bird-
men have looked in vain for it for years. The grass
parrot of Victoria is close to extinction, but there are
a few odd survivors in East Gippsland. An Aus-
tralasian parrot as extinct as the night parrot or the
dodo is the flightless parrot, once very plentiful on
Macquarie Island.
MY STRETCHER.

The broad verandah and the flapping screen—
These and iny stretcher, more I do not ask.
In such an hour I envy not the King.
Unbooted and pyjama’d let me lie;
While from my briar float, ring upon ring,
Ihe trailing' smoke-wreaths ’twixt me and the sky.

Netted and valanced with punctilious care;
Give me my stretcher where about my head
I feel the stars and know that Heaven is there.

a
Mr. J. B. DUNLOP.
(Illustration objected to)
News Cable (London). —*//• D. Dunlop, the inventor of the Pneumatic Tyre,
is seeking an injuncion to restrain the English Dunlop Tyre Company from
publishing a well-known portrait of himself. The grounds upon which the
application is based are that the portrait is too foppish and that it annoys
himself and his family. **
What a remarkable influence this man has had on the progress of the whole
civilised world —for it was the Dunlop Tyre that made cycling and motoring possible.
Mr. Dunlop was a veterinary surgeon in Dublin when the Dunlop Tyre was
conceived in 1888, and is now over 75 years of age. The story of the tyre has been
described as a romance. It first gained recognition in Dublin in May, 1889, when a
cyclist with a machine equipped with pneumatics, easily beat the pick of racing
cracks, romping away from his competitors with the aid of pneumatic tyres.
It was primarily through the 10 year old son of Dunlop that the pneumatic tyre
was invented. The lad did not mind a few jolts on the road but he wanted more
speed to beat the older boys, and it was solely to give it to him that the tyre was
finally perfected. When considering ways and means, Dunlop did not immediately
think of the pneumatic tyre, but first constructed a resilient wheel of steel. This was
not durable, so he then endeavoured to devise means to confine air within a tyre.
Dunlop sucured the rubber with which he made his first tube in sheets from a firm
in Edinburgh. It was one-thirty-second of an inch in thickness. The sheet of rubber
he cut into long strips and lapped it over to form a tube. He had to shave the edges
with a pocket knife, after which he spread on rubber solution with his finger. After
completing the tube, the inventor doubled it round, and, before joining the ends, he
made a tiny hole and inserted a length of rubber tubing from a baby’s feeding bottle.
He then solutioned the whole securely together and left it for several days, as he
was compelled to attend to his business. Later he stretched the tube over a disc of
wood 15 inches in diameter, and covered the whole with a piece of linen from a
woman’s dress. This was tacked all round with small tacks, and the tyre was then
inflated with his son’s football pump.
After testing the “ wheel,” Dunlop decided to make a set of tyres for his son’s bicycle, and secured fresh supplies of rubber.
The work occupied three months, and it was not until February 20, 1888, that they were ready to be tested. His son rode the
bicycle through the front door of the veterinary establishment at midnight on that date. After much difficulty he fitted a set of
tubes, covered with an outer casing of cotton, to steel wheels, and the tests were in every way successful.
The first Company floated to handle this tyre, was the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth Cycle Agency of Dublin towards
the end of 1889, and it is interesting to record the fact that Mr. W. J. Proctor, the General Manager of the Dunlop Rubber
Co. of Australasia, was employed by this Company, when a lad. In 1889 only a few racing tyres were .constructed, and
practically little headway made with the English Bicycle Trade which could not see that the pneumatic would stand up
against the wear of the cushion and solid rubber tyres then in vogue. In 1890 Mr. Dunlop, who was a director of the
Pneumatic Booth Co., and had received a few thousand pounds for his tyre interests, plus a royalty on tyres constructed,
found that the pneumatic tyres were not making the headway anticipated. It was then that Mr. H. DuCros decided on
controlling big interests in the Cycle Trade with a view of forcing the pneumatic tyre on the market. This move was
successful, and soon demonstrated the efficiency of the pneumatic, after which the Cycle business was separated from the
tyre interests, and the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. was formed, the capital being £15,000. In five years time from then, the
pneumatic tyre had supplanted all others for cycling right throughout the world. The capital of that Company to-day is
£7,500,000, and it has been computed that the world’s annual output of pneumatic tyres exceeds the enormous amount of
£130,000,000. Mr. Dunlop estimates that he received something like £50,000 through his invention. Needless to say the tyre in
its original form was not the tyre known to the present generation of Cyclists and Motorists. When first marketed, the
“ Dunlop ” consisted of an air-tube, 2 inches in diameter, which was wrapped on a crescent shaped rim by layers of thin canvas,
over this was fixed a rubber wearing strip, to protect the canvas from friction and road contact. The detachable principle came
later when Welch’s patent, covering the “ Wired-on ” system of attachment by internal air pressure (as used in cycle tyres
to-day) was bought in 1890 by the Dunlop people. Later on the Bartlett patent, covering the “Beaded Edge” system of attaching
to rim, was secured by the same firm, and it is this clincher type of cover that is now so largely used by Motorists throughout
the world to-day.
It will thus be realised by Cyclists and Motorists what a debt civilization owes to the inventor of
□
TYRE
The number of these tyres sold and the mileage
travelled in various parts of the world since
their inception would be something stupendous.
One thing is certain, no civilised country would
have developed to its present stage with-
out their aid. Second only in importance to
the value of the Dunlop Tyre as a means
of travel, is the remarkable fact that 32 years
after its inception it stills remains the same in
principle. To day it holds premier place in the
estimation of Cyclist and Motorists in this
country, giving economical and dependable
service. Never mind how severe the conditions
be, the old “ Dunlop ” slogan “ First in 1883,
foremost ever since,” is still to-day unassailable,
and users of these tyres, judging by the ever
increasing demand, appreciate the fact. When
you desire tyre reliability with low running
cost, always specify “Dunlops.” It’s your
guarantee of satisfaction. All Agents.

Thoughts and Language
Recent remarks about some of Austra-
lia’s dialect poets open up tortuous chan-
nels of thought, leading to wide ports of
argument. In “The Sentimental Bloke”
C. J. Dennis jumps a step. He makes his
work human without being real; and in
this he has done what is impossible to most
writers. Such characters as the Bloke and
Doreen undoubtedly exist. They may even
talk in exactly the same way as these two.
But where would you find people in their
walk _of life who think the thoughts that
Dennis expresses in gently-ambling verse?
And may it not he that his books appeal to
all classes because lie makes Doreen and
the Bloke appear and act and think in the
way that most men and women would like
to apnear and act and think if the Devil
would let them? He has broadened the type
and glorified it, and it appeals to all classes
despite the dialect.
I don’t agree with Mr. Slessor when he
says that the hawker of Woolloomooloo does
not. think in slang. But I’m open to con-
viction. I know white men who not only
talk Maori, but think Maori; except for
their color, they are Maoris. If the hawker
spoke his thoughts aloud he would use
slang, because anyone who has the power
of speech must use words to express thought,
and the habit has extended to the thinking
of thoughts. Dennis, not being a Woolloo-
mooloo hawker, thinks in English the
thoughts that belong to himself; then he
writes them in the hawker’s slang, and in
doing so lifts the hawker to a higher plane
than he ever could have pushed his own
harrow up to. The slang is the link with
Woolloomooloo—the scenery of the play.
The verse form is the hawker’s barrow which
keeps its slow wheels and the reader on solid
earth, while Doreen and the Bloke wander
in a land full of the sentiment that every
human heart yearns for, having tasted tiny
samples here in this workaday world. The
same kind of yearning makes the market for
best-sellers in the realm of novels; also it
makes men think on a hot day of the Manly
boat 7 in the moonlight and a pretty girl in a
white frock and a band playing the Barca-
rolle.
WILL LAWSON.
A Satchel of Books
Living Alone, by Stella Benson (Macmil-
lan). A book that has not a dull word,
that runs three smiles to the page and a
laueh to every half-dozen, is a rare circum-
stance. You would hardly expect to find it
under the sober title of Living Alone; yet
there it is—a magic book, a book fall of
nonsense and wise philosophy. The authoress
tells us it is not a real book for real people;
but she knows very well that her magic is
real and her inconsequence the most con-
vincing truth. There is a real witch in the
pages, a witch who rides a broomstick —
its name is Harold —and fights another
witch high up over the German raiders. The
world is suffering from lack of magic—that
is what caused the war. Take a quotation:
Opposite them, on two camp-stools, sat a young
bridling mother of 50, with her old hard daughter
of 16 or so. Hard was that daughter in every-
way ; you would have counted her age in winters,
not in summers, so obviously 7 untender were her
years. An iron plait of hair lay' for about six
inches down her spine; and her feet and ankles
made the camp-stool on which she sat look patheti-
cally ethereal. Of such stuff as this is the back-
bone of England made, which is perhaps why the
backbone of England sometimes seems so sadly in-
flexible.
A book to thank God for without bothering
to find its place in literature.
Charles Ilcdley, who has just succeeded
the learned Etheridge as acting-director of
Sydney Museum, has written a popular shil-
ling book about “The Wild Animals of the
World” for the trustees of the Sydney Zoo.
It is a guide to that park, and much more:
it has something of interest to gay not only
of the animals that Le Souef already has
in his charge, but also of those that he hopes
to have some day. And there is incidental
reference to some that he can never have.
I or instance :
The earpincho (hydrochcerus caprivara ) attains a
length of 4ft. and a weight of 1001 b. Thus it
exceeds in size all other living rodents, though
the extinct South American megamys, the largest
rat that ever lived, grew to the size of a cow.
A tenth cousin is the prairie dog, more
nearly related to the marmot; and he is
related to the squirrels. The Zoo has no more
attractive little animals than these N.
American pests, which burrow as much as
15ft., and post a sentinel on a watch-tower.
“The warrens, or dog-towns,” Mr. lied ley
says, “extend across the plains for great
distances. One was found to stretch without
a break for a hundred miles.” It is a fine
hook for a youngster (any youngster up to
90) who has had a day at Taronga Park.
Field, Forest and Farm, by Jean Henri
Fabre (Century Co., New' York, through
Angus and Robertson). Another book by
the delightful old French naturalist. This
one explains why the farmer, fruitgrower
and stockbreeder do a thousand things when
they know 7 their job —why one soil wants
one kind of fertilising w'hile another soil
wants something different; why one vege-
table calls for this help and another for that;
what potatoes are made of and why you
“soil” them; why barley that has started
to sprout makes beer, and almonds have
three coats and a silk under-garment. The
hook is written in a popular way; and the
man on the land who can read it and not
know more about his job and feel more in-
terested in it is either very well instructed
or a dull clod.
Notes of a Camp Follower, by F. W.
Ilornung (Constaole). This popular Eng-
lish storyteller went to France with Y.
Emma because he w 7 as too old to go with a
gun; and he likes best to remember that
he was soon christened “the cocoa man.”
There isn’t much in Notes that is not very
familiar; but they are pleasant sketches
mostly of what the other fellow did—and
didn’t do. Ilornung- often thought there
were things that were better left undone
Such little sins as they denounce! Bad language
for one, as if the low, thoughtless word should seri-
ously belittle the high deliberate deed. The decen-
cies of language let us by all means observe, but
as decencies, not as virtues without which a man
shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
Old Man Savarin Stories, by Edward
William Thomson (T. Werner Laurie).
These are stories of Canadian backwoods
mostly, very graphic many of them, with
good humor in all of them. The writer
evidently knows his stage, and his book is
well worth while if only for its pictures of
social conditions.
The Seventh Vial, by Frederick Sleath
(Herbert Jenkins). This is a romance of
the air, and tells of the men who fought
splendid battles there. There is much excel-
lent description; and once or twice the nar-
rative rises to tragic grandeur. There is
a great scene wherein Bill’s aeroplane comes
home in the dawning with the engine silent
and the great' wings barely clearing the
hangars. Bill sits there crbuched and dead.
His machine is riddled with bullets; but as
he died he shut off the engine and glided
home. The characters are drawn clearly,
and the thrills are many.
__ The Diamond Cross Mystery, by Chester
K. S. Steele (Herbert Jenkins). This book
supplies a mystery and a curiously dull and
ineffective detective who is supposed to find
the key to the riddle; but the yarn simply
trickles out and winds up with a confessor
of guilt by the bad man. A verv stupid
book even in its class—which is a low one
The Skipper of the Roaring Meg, by Jack
McLaren (N.S.W. Bookstall Co.). This is
much more than just the usual story of tropic
life and color. Beach and palm and coral
reef all sink into their appropriate places to
form the natural setting for the singularly
well-drawn character of the complex Vanua
—she who was “a half-white woman by acci-
dent of birth, but a whole woman for all
that.” Vanua, in spite of her father’s asser-
tion that the half-caste is cursed with the
vices of both parents unredeemed by the
virtues of either, looks out from these pages
like some grand untamed woman of an age
that knew not sex-penalties and male pro-
perty rights in long-haired mates; and
Vanua, the splendid savage, waiting for
death on the reef —inspiring Certain with
something of her own courage, almost happy
in her simple fatalist’s faitn ana her hope-
less love for him—recalls, in her power and
pathos, Hugo’s “Toilers of the Sea.” There
are faults in the book, of course, for those
who seek such ; for one thing it is much too
short. But there is not one dull page. Mr.
McLaren will write novels much more tech-
nically perfect than this one. He will do
well if he maintains its high level of clean
sincerity and fine humanity.
The Inky Way
Obit, the Woman Voter, the once virile
little sheet run by the Women’s Political Ass
of Victoria. It was born about 1910, and
first came out as a glad weekly message,
with a full programme for Women’s eman
cipation. Vida Goldstein, who is now in
Britain devoting all her energies to “Chris-
tian Science,” was the editress for about
nine years. When she left to accompany
Cecilia John to the Berne Conference the
little paper started to fade.
“N.”: A Sydney man sent abroad 18
months ago by the Education Department to
report about up-to-date methods of teaching
met Stephen Leacock by appointment early-
one morning at the Montreal Club, and
picked up some valuable information. An
hour’s chat exhausted the subject. The talk
was then .manoeuvred in the direction of
“Literary Lapses.” but the seeker after know-
ledge encountered a check. It was 11 o’clock
and Leacock said “whisky and soda.” They
demolished it. Another chance came, and
that time the Professor suggested a view of
the local sights. He talked hard till lunch
time, discussing pacificism, prohibition, eco-
nomics, Ilohenzollerns. When a final oppor-
tunity occurred the Professor discovered
some ladies to take to tea. Dinner ended
the day, but every venture to encourage Lea-
cock to talk about his own writings died
ingloriously.
“Sphincter” and doctors’ intelligence:—
“A Country Doctor” (B. 15/l/’2O) unwittingly
confirms my statement concerning the intellectual
status of the medical profession by wrongly endeavor-
ing to compare literature and medicine. What is to
be gained by comparing Alexis Carrel and Carlyle or
Robert Jones and Rossetti ? As well compare a cheese-
monger and a choirmaster. Judged by die
traditional standard of “usefulness” the cheese-
monger takes ascendancy over the choirmaster.
But that does not imply that a man is hipjilv
intellectual because he makes cheese. Some doctors
do write and write well. Dr. A. T. Schofield, Dr.
C. W. Saleeby, Dr. Havelock Ellis and others have
creative intelligence of a high order. They and
men like Ehrlich, Pavlov and Lewis, engaged on
purely scientific investigation, form the living
nucleus of an otherwise almost torpid profession.
In this I am supported by Dr. Archdall Reid, a
man of wide culture, who maintains that “the
intellectual outlook of the average medical man is
not noticeably wider than that of the average
solicitor or merchant.” And as “A Country Doctor"
mentions Sir William Osier (recently deceased), I
quote a passage from one of his essays: “As the
soul is dyed by the thoughts, let no day pass
without contact with the best literature... .Know
the great souls that make up the moral radium of
the world.” Yet our “Country Doctor” seriously
asserts to a ribald world that “the literary man is
a, midge.” Plato, Socrates, Shakspeare and Goethe
midges !

“Huffin-Guffin”: Re tea prices, us detailed
by “Araminta” (B. 15/l/’2O). I, too,
noticed a recent announcement that at the
Calcutta tea .sales about 4,000,0001 b. had
been offered, and prices ranged from : ]d. to
id. higher. This was the day after I had
been to my teaman and persuaded him to
let me have 51b. at a rise of Is. a lb. on the
previous month’s prices.

“Expert Too”: “Arthur R.’s” bald state-
ment (B. 8/1/20) that the Baudot system
of telegraphic transmission achieved 32 mes-
sages simultaneously over the one wire makes
the layman gasp; but the dozen or two
experts who know smile tolerantly. The
amazed layman should be told that these 32
messages transmitted manually on a Baudot
set would occupy about one minute of time
and represent about 240 words. Now, on the
Sydney to Melbourne Wheatstone I can get
double this pace out of one wire. But these
two facts are secondary considerations when
comparing systems. The fact to remember
is that we in Australia have put in about 10
years developing the Wheatstone system, but
the parsimony of the Department has not
given it a fair chance. We have not trained
an expert .staff of Gellists (operators who
use an elaborate kind of typewriter which
punches a tape with holes representing the
message to be transmitted) ; we have not pro-
vided them with the best kind of punching
typewriter; we do not work line instruments
at the pace they are capable of sustaining;
and we don’t provide the necessary “spares”
to maintain continuity of work. In fact, I
don’t think the practical annual efficiency
comes up to 50 per cent. Some Wheatstone
circuits are worked intermittently because
the Department has not sufficient punching
typewriters in working order. Instead of
spending another 10 years working up an-
other system (educating the staff chiefly),
the Department ought to give the Wheat-
stone a chance to do what it is capable of
doing.

“Adelaide”: The Royal Agricultural
Society of S.A. has decided to go on with
its new showgrounds at Wayville, just out-
side the city limits. They were being lain
out when the war started, and have since
been hung up in hope of better times. The
Jubilee Oval was expected to serve, as of
old, for any show that might be held; but
it has been in use as camp or influenza
hospital, and the Society, after losing both
March and September shows last year, is
driven to face the expense of completing its
new, half-finished venture. Building prices
are sickening, but they do not seem likely
to come down. The present idea is to finish
the grandstand on the design already ap-
proved, and put up shells for the exhibits,
leaving room for ornamental fronts when
better times arrive. The Jubilee Oval will
take the coming March show.

“Cobbler”: Leather ought to be both
plentiful and reasonably cheap in Australia ;
but it is neither. It is impossible to get
supplies sufficient and suitable for local re-
quirements, because the tanners are mak-
ing stuff for export which shows them a
larger profit. Industries can’t expect con-
sideration from the Government if they
don’t give first consideration to their home
market; and the Government ought to give
this industry a hint to that effect.
* * * *
From an insider :
Mr. Allard, the Commissioner appointed by the
N. S. Wales Government to inquire into the
finances of its trawling business, says that while
3,023,6401 b. of green fish was brought in only
1,479,1681 b. were sold. This shows that 1,544,4721 b.
were not sold. No explanation is given of this
loss of over 50 per cent, of weight. Gutting can-
not account for it all. The coastal depots are said
to have paid £6,311 for 833,5641 b. which gave only
425,7831 b. saleable food. This means that the
fishermen, who were alleged to be benefited by the
establishment of these depots, received less than
lfd. per lb., and it cost the industry. 34d. by the
time the wastage was eliminated. Mr. Allard recom-
mends an increase in the price of fish in Sydney,
lie should have shouted for a reduction of overhead
charges and an explanation of the great shrinkage.
The Government has evidently allowed a good State
undertaking to slide, and it will take some hard
work to pull it up. The public, however, should
permit of no selling out. Private Enterprise did not
come in and tackle the problem of deep-sea fish,
and now that the State has so much capital invested
in the business it ought to put a business man in
chaige and let him establish it on a commercial
footing.

THE SALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The stores had closed down on old Willis,
And we gathered from far and from nigh
For the chance of a yarn or a bargain,
And forgot it was “still keepin’ dry.”
The auctioneer came bright and early,
And he wielded his hammer with skill;
He praised the fine frames of the cattle,
Cracking jokes as smart auctioneers will.
We followed him round and applauded
All the witty remarks that he’d make,
Till he’d sold all there was on the holding,
And Tom Johnston’s old moke by mistake.
Bill Smith came to bid for the waggon,
And took home the fowls and the plough.
Jack White came to look for a seed-drill,
And lie purchased an old Berkshire sow.
“Kh, mon,” remarked Sandy McPherson,
When he bought what was left of the sheep,
“It s guid to be helpin’ a neebour
When they knock his goods down to ye cheap.”
“A harrd worrkin’ man,” said Ned Hogan,
“Faith there isn’t the taste of a doubt
He’d be kapin’ his head above wather
If the place wasn’t parrchetf wid the drought.”

Some of the outsizes in matrimonial ad-
venture in the Ma State during 1918: —
The youngest ’groom was 15 and the oldest 85;
and he was a bachelor, too. Two other oldsters who
set sail were 81 and 82, and had hitherto shunned
the terrors of this sea; but there were three of 80
who were making a second voyage. At the other end
of the line were eight youths of 16 and 13 of 17 ;
and altogether 1395 mentioned that they were under
21. The Australian gives himself plenty of time for
repentance, at any rate.
The importance of “pictures” for propa-
ganda work has lately been emphasised in a
queer way in England. A crowd of inter-
nationals went to see a film called “Bol-
shevism,” which represented it on unflat-
tering lines; whereupon they gave notice to
the management that it must be withdrawn.
Next evening the house (at Clapham) was
packed with returned soldiers and sailors,
and the picture was thrown on the screen.
There was a brisk fight, and the audience
had something more exciting than the screen
to watch most of the time.
The craft unions had better keep their
eyes open. Whenever the “industrials” get
a chance they put in a claim that, if lads
are employed in an industry, they shall get
the minimum prescribed for adult men. The
miners of Broken Hill yell for that; now
the timber-workers of Westralia put in a
similar claim. It means, of course, that
boys will not be employed, but that unskilled
men will come in at full rates. That is to
say, a blow' is being aimed at any extra
payment for skill; and any more abomin-
able doctrine from a national point of view
it would be hard to imagine.
Every other week or so Victoria puts up
a new record in land-prices. A tenant farm
at Yangery, owned by David Keys, himself a
farmer of heavy tonnage at Colac, was sold
the other day for £122 an acre. The place
had been farmed for 20 years by James
McCosh; and it was bought by Mac’s neigh-
bor, John Gleeson. The land-hungiy
returned soldier, looking at the constantly-
growing prices, begins to suspect that he is
getting a rough spin from the very men
whose property he so vigorously helped to
keep intact.
“Cadet O.”: “Hannibal Junior” (B.
29/l/’2O) says that employers have
“worked the oracle” to get the cadets’ drill
started at 4 p.m., thus compelling many lads
to drill in tneir own and not (as the law
requires) in the employers’ time. The truth
is that the Defence Department, with rare
consideration, shifted the starting time to
4 p.m. so that the lads would not have to
drill in the hottest hours of the day. During
the winter months these “employers’ time
parades” start at 2 p.m.; and apart from a
desire to study the comfort of the lads, the
Department would just as soon that was
the hour all the year round.
An instance of the way in which aliens
sometimes reach Australian territory came
to light at Thursday Island recently. A
couple of Malays, who had come down in a
lugger from Dutch New Guinea, turned up at
a neighboring island and were brought over
to Thursday. Later on they admitted that
when they set out on their voyage they had a
Chinaman with them, but had lost him on
the wav. They were vague as to what had
become of him, but he had been put ashore
somewhere. And at least two cases are
quoted at Thursday Island of luggers coming
down from the Aru Islands and. landing
Japanese at Double Island, near Cairns.
Some people still believe that oil will be
found in Westralia, and Minister for Mines
Scaddan is one of them. Scaddan professes
to be “fairly optimistic,” though all the
prospecting so far done in the State has re-
sulted in a blank. The Government geolo-
gists hold out little hope, and several out-
side experts agree with them. Neverthe-
less Scaddan is not disheartened, and has
decided to encourage prospecting, on the
condition that if a find is made the State
shall have the right to purchase. But you’ll
never encourage people to do real prospecting
for oil in Australia unless you hold out
the prospect of big prizes; and expropria-
tion by the State isn’t likely to yield a very
big prize. Really, now that the principle
of price-fixing has been established, State
ownership isn’t of so much consequence as
it was, except so far perhaps as it is neces-
sary to provide for the State’s own needs.
“Gee Whiz”; No doubt it is very noble of
Arthur Robinson, Vic. Attorney-General, to
go to England at his own expense, not charg-
ing the country for fares for his wife and
daughter either! But why should he make
the trip at all? Treasurer McPherson is
just back from London after inquiring into
the money market, the fruit trade, a new
Commissioner of Railways, immigration and
the duties of the Agent-General. Robin-
son’s announced programme is identical, but,
in addition, he has something to ask about
butter, apples and King Edward’s missing
statue. Peter Mcßride, the Agent-General,
left on the steamer before Robinson, and if
he doesn’t know the Stock Exchange ropes
in London why did Robinson and his col-
leagues reappoint him the other day? It is
more than a farce to send special envoys
to do little errands like this when the State
pays an Agent-General to do them. It is a
scandal.
“Veronal”: Touching the Nichols-Lester
trial, the first of any consequence in which
Edmund Barton was briefed, W. B. Dailey
was first offered the job of defending
Nichols; but Dailey sent for Eitzhardinge,
afterwards Judge, and suggested that he
should take it. He did so, although he
knew there was little kudos to be gained.
Fitzhardinge’s friends should persuade him
to write his reminiscences. He could almost
make a book of yarns about his predecessor
on the southern circuit, the late Judge
McFarland. Here’s one. While a coach,
the box-seat of which held the Judge and
R. E. O’Connor, was crossing a river the
former told the driver to heave to while he
got down on the wheel to inspect some dead
fish. While McFarland was busy on the
spokes someone gave the horses a sly cut
with the whip, and his Honor took a beade”.
After that a mounted policeman was put in
charge and escorted a dripping Judge into
town.

9 Months Old Baby
Healed By GoHcnra
Of Skin Trouble. Burning All the
Time. Thought Would Have
to Cut Fingers at First Joint.
"My little baby was troubled for
nine months with a nasty skin com-
śd
plaint. The fingers on each
of her hands got very red
down to the first joint and
then tinder the nails. They
were burning all the time
and very sore ’ to touch.
It then started on her little
feet. I thought she would
have to have her lingers off at the first
joint as I was told they would never
get better.
“I sent for a sample of Cuticura Soap
and Ointment which gave her relief so I
bought more and she was healed."

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“Dido'’ : A quaint preliminary to a big Mel-
bourne fight was, as the humorous referee explained,
to be “all in and heaven help the loser.” The
trouble, we were assured, was all about a lady. The
combatants were a lad of perhaps 18 and a man of
close upon 50—a wiry, hard-faced man who might
have been a bottle-o in reduced circumstances. The
lad was much the same type—ginger-headed, flesh-
less, and tough as leather. The fight was most
willing for three rounds. The combatants knew a
little, and what they lacked in ability they compen-
sated for with fervor. Both were cut up at the
end of three, and the next round saw the elder man
all out. The boy did what he liked to him, but
presently let up, greatly to the disgust of his
barrackers, lads from his street evidently, who
fiercely admonished him to “Get to the cow!” “Hit
him up!” “Out the swine, Jimmo!” Here Jimmo
turned to the pressmen close to the ring, and said:
“The ole , he’s me father, and I don’t want
to mess him about, but he’s got to be taught to
treat me mother better.”
In a big Melbourne match the other day a
fieldsman failed to get his hands properly on the
ball, but it ran down his arm and fell into his
pocket. It recalls the effort of a comic little York-
shireman who came to Australia with two. or three
international elevens. Playing against Vic. on the
Melbourne ground and running with his cap in his
hand and his usual monkey tricks to take an unex-
pected catch, he missed the ball with his hands, but
knocked it up with his knee. The ball struck him
on the nose and fell into the cap he still held in his
hand. “Out!”
An unrecorded incident at a little dinner
to the A.I.F. oricket team in Melbourne the other
day is an indication of the deep feeling that exists
between certain players and the controlling Associa-
tion. Just before the spread a prominent player had
a few words with one of the Vic. selectors and
whacked the latter on the nose. The official
attempted to mingle the enemy’s blood with his own,
but some Philistine with a hopeless regard for
decorum firmly separated the lunging desperadoes and
achieved a passable imitation of peace. The un-
happy part of the affair was that the bashed selector
had to retire from a perfect menu with a shirt-front
suggesting a recent massacre, whilst the cause of
the trouble dined nobly and got off with an apology
in the morning. No doubt the apology restored
the gentlemanly atmosphere which every Vic. cric-
keter is supposed to breathe; but starting a brawl
on a serious and solemn occasion with Monash and
other celebrities present is surely a sacrilege demand-
ing definite punishment.
* * * *
The Vic. Cricket Association insists on
the rule barring paid officials from serving on sub-
committees to select teams for inter-State matches.
Armstrong is chief clerk, in the office of the Melbourne
Cricket Club, and the general suspicion that he
holds the billet on account of his cricket has pro-
fessionalised him sufficiently in the eyes of the Asso-
ciation to make it impossible for him to serve in
the aforesaid capacity. Rightly or' wrongly, the
regulation has been framed to exclude the covert
professionalism that Armstrong represents, and no
amount of howling by his noisy barrackers in Mel-
bourne can demolish the fact that -the ukase is
backed by considered judgment of the Associ.it d
clubs and has only now been rudely criticised after
months of unquestioning acceptance by Victorian
elevens. In the light of some recent happenings in
Melbourne, the revolt of the three Vic. selectors in
Sydney the other day has a curious resemblance to a
sympathy strike designed to embarrass the Associa-
tion and boost a figure whose prestige as a captain
and even as a cricketer is rather waning.
* * * *
Jack Blaekham, tlie wicket-keeper, was
the last man in Australia to endeavor to reconcile
sport and whiskers. He belonged to the W. G.
Grace period, which went back to a time when even
a belltopper was not incompatible with athletics.
Blaekham brought whiskers in sport down to a
time when they had begun to be ignominious in
ordinary life, and clove to them although they let
him in for endless derision from the pushes. Once
he confessed he came within an ace of sacrificing his
bunch, but on the afternoon of the very day on
which he had hovered round them with greedy
scissors, a ball came up and caught him such a
bash on the chin that he was rolled out for a
moment. “Thank God I kept my whiskers on!”
he said to the umpire who helped him. And after
that, when any humorist suggested the advisability
of mowing ’em, Blaekham would say: “No
blamed fear! I wear these in self-defence.”
# * * *
“T. 0.1.” : Henry Fysche Gisborne, in the
’thirties third police-magistrate in Sydney and later
sole Crown Lands Commissioner at Port Phillip, was
chairman of the meeting at which it was decided
to form a racecourse on the flat at the Saltwater
River, now known as Flemington. The first meeting
was held in March, 1840, just upon 80 years ago.
Gisborne left Melbourne late in 1840 and sailed from
Sydney for England via India and the Cape of Good
Hope. He died at sea between the Cape and St.
Helena, April 30, 1841.
“Ken L.”: Went into a sporting dep6t
the other day to buy some tennis-balls. I was able
to get three at ss. each —the only three available.
Supplies coming forward were quoted at ss. 6d.
Better balls than the ones I purchased could be
bought in 1915 at Is. 6d. I see that lubber is
cheaper than it was in 1915. I suppose it is the
air to fill ’em with that has got so expensive.
“Ah Do”: Several Chinese have been
fined in Sydney for playing gee-far, and one of the
dailies described it as new. It. isn’t really; it has
been played in Sydney for years. But as there are
only one* or two banks it is not so widely known as
pak-a-pu. Unlike that gamble, gee-far lays stated
odds —30 to 1. The player is supplied with a ticket
marked off in 30 squares. Each square has a
symbol—animal, fish, bird or reptile. The marker
of the ticket puts a cross on the square he fancies.
When the time comes for the drawing of the bank
30 pieces of paper each bearing a symbol similar
to one on the ticket are put in a basket and one
is drawn by the Chinaman in charge. That is the
winning ticket, and all tickets marked with that
symbol are paid. Tickets may be marked for from
one penny up to one pound or more. The bank is,
as a rule, drawn three times a day.

Fletcher’s dock at Glanville is now one
of Adelaide’s best swimming enclosures. The mile
championship of S.A., held there, brought out onlv
two starters, Spencer Major, the holder, being unable
through illness to defend. Reg Beaglehole (Moonta)
won easily from Harry Moon (Semaphore) in 2Gmin.
24see. Another swimming place much improved of
late is a well-known old-time pool in the nearly dry
Torrens at Walkerville, just above the city. It has
been taken in hand by a strong local club, and there
is good racing occasionally.
Connie Jeans has just put up an English
record for a 200yds. swim. The venue was Notting-
ham and the time 3min. 4see. Claire Gilligan, of New
York, covered the distance in 2min. 41sec. in 1918 !
and Fanny Durack did 220yds. in 2min. 63see. on
Feb. 14, 1916.
“P.G.”: When Stewart McArthur, K.C.,
the new Judge of Vic. Supreme Court, was a
senior student at Geelong College, the custom of
sending challenges by chosen .champions to other
schools was still in vogue. I remember McArthur
presenting himself at Melbourne Grammar, and de-
livering a football challenge in the prescribed form.
He did it quite all right, but I don’t remember
whether he carried a pennant or spoke like a stage
herald. After leaving school McArthur played
cricket, football and tennis, and is still a member
of the committee of the M.C.C.

USED by the Commonwealth and various State
Governments of Australia, Water and Sewerage
Boards, Roads Boards, Irrigation Commissions,
City, Town and Shire Councils and Private Contractors,
they always live up to our claims that they are the
“CHAMPION” Plows of Australia.
The extra special high quality of the steel used in their
construction is largely responsible for the reputation they
have earned for extreme durability and resistance against
breakage and undue wear even under the hardest
working conditions.
Another feature of importance is their very short length
—a point that contributes largely to their success because
they can be used and turned in places where no other
plows would enter.
One user (name on request) writes to say that he is
using the same shares on his No. 65 Wiard plow that
were supplied 9 to 10 years ago, and that after being
worked continually, yet costing not more than 5/- the
whole period for repairs.
We can quote scores of examples where WIARD ROAD
PLOWS have saved big money and lots of labor for
their users. Write for details.

Buy
Your Corset
Carefully
No garment of a woman’s
wardrobe is more impor-
tant than the corset. No
woman can be too partic-
ular about the kind and
style of corset she pur-
chases.
Gossard Corsets are
eqsy to buy because of the
exact science with which
they are designed for the
needs of the various figure
types. Their proper pur-
chase merely means that
thoughtful care you gen-
erally give to matters of
importance.
Every Gossard Corset represents complete corset
economy regardless of its price. No woman is so
poor she cannot afford a Gossard Corset. No
woman is so rich she cannot afford to practice true
corset economy.
The more you know about correct corsetry the
more you will appreciate the superiority of Gos-
sards from the standpoint of comfort, hygiene,
style and wearing service.

There was a rumor on Monday last, as
untrue as it was discreditable to its authors,
that, in view of the tremendous audiences;
the H.C L.; the house, flat and room famine ;
and the recent rise in the price of bottled
beer, some of the most amusing and decora-
tive members of the “Lightnin’ ” Co. now
showing at Sydney Criterion, * had decided
to declare a “darg” as from next Saturday’s
matinee. The malcontents claimed alter-
natively ( so it was mendaciously alleged)
a flat rate all round for workers, both in
front and behind, of £lOO a week, exclusive
of champagne and taxi money. The natural
result was that boarding-house rates in Dar-
linghurst soared immediately to an unheard-
of figure. The position of the management
was briefly stated for the benefit of the
hashhouses immediately affected : the artists
might be worth the increased remuneration,
but they were not going to get it. That ended
the trouble, and “Lightnin’ ” goes on as usual
at the old address.
To-night (Thursday) “The Bing Boys on
Broadway” score their 61st performance at
Sydney Majesty’s. The big show keeps on
glittering cheerfully to good houses.
“The Little Damozel” still sits on the
table at Sydney Palace and swings her silk-
stockings cheekily. This Einelie Polim play
with its successful punter hero should suit
the sports everywhere,
“As You Were” finishes at the Tivoli on
Friday night. On Saturday the Sydney
house of Mclntosh will revive “The Officers’
Mess,” beginning at the matinee.
Norma Talmadge, beautiful and well
dressed, shows “The Way of a Woman” at
the Sydney Crystal Palace. Sheltered at
Globe and Haymarket is that very able actor
John Barrymore. As a wealthy young buck
in ‘The Test of Honor,” he has complica-
tions with a married woman, whose husband
he outs in a fierce box-on and is gaoled for
manslaughter on the evidence of the false
woman and her sawbones lover. The broad
arrow discarded, he forces the woman, now
a judge’s wife, to accept him as an old pal
and a» x member of her fashionable set. The
doctor quarrels with the woman after plot-
ting with her to do for the gaolbird. That
explodes the plot and clears Barrymore.
‘Alack Stage” at both houses sees Arbuckle
twanging the harp to the “Salome Siren,
buried in stage snow, mixed up with
falling scenery and finally bolting with the
treasury. Chinatown is at Hoyt’s for a
weeiv. Viola Dana as a gutter belle in “The
Microbe” becomes entangled in a street
brawl and is rescued by a venturesome
young ink-slinger. As the hero is addicted
to drugs, last night is but a muddled recol-
lection. In the morning he offers the take-
up girl a home and education; but his family
objects and persuades her to leave him. How-
ever, the dear little kitten comes home in
the last reel, and the love-distraught young
man becomes a great and solvent *uitnor. The
four home-made films which the Shell dis-
plnvs in an all-Australian programme should
receive a loud welcome. Overlander Francis
Birtles contributes a four-reel feature of in-
land Australia; and that alone is worth twice
the money.
* * * *
Judging by the appearance of “Kissing
Time” at Melbourne Royal, the popularity
of musical madnesses that begin in a garden
and end in a cafd is practically inexhaus-
tible. Experience proves they can’t do better
than end in a cafe where everybody wears
an astonishing costume and nobody comes
to eat. In this case the scene of the in-
terior of the Cafd de Finale is preceded by
a front scene of its exterior, which also
appeals to one’s treasured memories of the
Past. The path of “Kissing Time” is paved
with recollections and resemblances, and the
one surprising feature of the performance is
the countenance of comedian Leonard, guilt-
less of disguise and free from even a red
nose. For a brief space at the outset Leslie
Holland wears a fringe of sofa-stuffing
around his chin and an air of not knowing
what on earth he looks like, but Leonard is
always a keen-faced husband in distress, re-
quired to adapt his dial to the situation in-
stead of having it made up to meet all
emergencies. Talking of faces, the winsome
smile of Nellie Payne is more than usually
fetching. It ife beaming, roguish, arch or

A - big audience
had a cheerful
evening with the
All Diggers Co. at Melbourne Play-
house on Saturday. “Mademoiselle Mimi',”
the “comedy” presented, is only three
acts of song and patter without any
visible story to hold tuem together, but the
all-round ability of the party is ample
apology for this discrepancy. The leading
man and producer is Arthur Keighley, who
indulges in caricatures of johnny offieahs
“On the Staff” and elsewhere. Broader and
cruder comedy is supplied by George Jen-
nings, who carries the crowd by frontal at-
tacks on its sense of humor. George scores
best in “Cab-bages, Ca-beans, and Car-rots”;
and his idea of a trance medium is made
especially funny by the anxiety of his dial
to show his emotions. Roy Glenister and
Cyril James are the sentimental songsters,
and there is about an equal quantity of
honey in their efforts, though Roy owns a
voice of greater quality. Hughie Gannon
is another medicine for misery. He jokes
in various ways and warbles a ditty, “Yar-
rawonga,” which beats “Tipperary” as a
homesick item. The combined work of the
Diggers is always tuneful. But the Made-
moiselle who gives the title to the tale is
easily the biggest hit of the night. Probably
a few men suspect at the outset that Mimi’s
real name is Clarence or Archibald, but any
number would be sufficiently bluffed by the
fake to try to make a date with her. The
success of the impersonation is greater for
the reason that the warrior has the Mimi
ankles and falsetto to deepen the fraud.
The responsibilitv of a large family and
a beery husband is wearing out Ma Hub-
bard at Melbourne King’s. one of these
nights the old lady will be worn to a bone,
and will then pernaps-provide the meal for
dog Fido that the cupboaru can’t furnish.
Fido, however, doesn’t look like a case of
disappointed appetite. With the plump
Hassan inside him he seems to have had a
young elephant for dinner.

Beauty” continues to make no apology for

The last nights
of the revue period
at Melbourne
Tivoli were more
or less gladdened
by a revival of
“Buzz-Buzz” o n
Saturday after-
noon. “B u z z-
buzx” is for six
nights only, and
then some more
revival will close
the present com-
pany’s . chapter.
There are moments
when the heart
seems to have gone
out of this pano-
rama o f happen-
ings, if a revue can be credited with a heart.
Probably it cannot. But even “Buzz-Buzz”
has a liver, and just now the organ is de-
ranged.
The story of “Ginger Mick” is being retold
with the help of Bill and Doreen at Mel-
bourne Town Hall. Snowy Baker’s “Man
From Kangaroo” scurries ahead of “Ginger”
and produces a yarn of Australian cattle-
duffing with the insane action of cowboy
films. Snowy, as the holy hero, has a dirty
left, but all his other extremities are equally
educated, and when he uses them all in seem-
ingly hairbreadth perils the frequency of his
marvels tends to make him monotonous. The
photography, however, is excellent and
affords fine views of Outback.

In “When Fate Decides” at Hoyt’s Mel-
bourne house, Madlaine Traverse calls in
the Third Degree to save her from a murder
charge. The yarn is common and obvious
enouvn. but the examination of the suspect is
an excellent bit of realism. George Walsh
shows ms whirlwind acting in an endeavor to
run down a set of burglars in “Help, Help,
Police!” George’s activity is aroused by
the fact that he has been nabbed on suspi-
cion and has to get the real offenders to
prove his own innocence. At the Britannia

Michael’s chances.

“The House of Lies,” at Adelaide Tivoli,
is an American play of the more human
sort. The heroine, loving one man, is
pushed into marriage with another, a mil-
lionaire ; she scores off his rich and scorn-
ful relatives, and presently, of course, finds
herself in love with him. She is even able
to pick up the old lover and make a friendly
group of the three. Nellie Bramley does
all this emotional work with good effect.

Pav “The Senti-
mental Bloke” is
having another innings. Australia will sup-
port its own films all right if it can get
them.
England is beginning to get a bit of its
own back from America in the matter of
payment for films. The British record price
has now gone up to 40,000 dollars, just paid
for the American (including Canadian) right
to exhibit a London-made sensation, "Twelve-
ten.”
“Tamakoa”: M6r6 waddled into a drapery
emporium and demanded to be shown “te
corses” (i.e., corsets). The young man pro-
duced several with suspenders attached.
None of them met with the wahine’s ap-
nrovnl. ‘‘l don’t want him wit’ te stirrups,”
she finally explained to the young ferra.
“Panacre”: Talking of the right of the
country town to some of the advantages
freely given to the capital, Mrs. Malaprop
got off a good one during the Newcastle
municipal election. “And, ladies and gentle-
men,” she said, “what is good for the goose
is the gander.”
The National Council for Combating V.D.
in England has put out a seven-reel film
which goes a long way beyond “Damaged
Goods.” It shows the consequences of neg-
lect, and includes an operation scene. The
general verdict at a private screening in
London was that it must be either cut down
a lot or shown separately, and especially
as propaganda—perhaps both. “The End
of the Road” is the title.
One of the yarns of singing parson Frank
Gorman, which he does not tell across the
water. An American was puffing hard about
the marvels of the States, and stacking won-
ders tier on tier, when a listening Britisher
intervened with: “Pretty good all those
things! But we have a bugle which was
sounded in England in 1914, and it wasn’t
heard in the United States till nearly three
years afterwards.”
N. S. Wales Art Gallery is now repre-
sented in London by a committee —John
Longstaff, chairman ; Frank Brangwyn, R.A.;
Sir George Frampton, 11. A.; and John
Burns, P.C.; with W. Graham Lloyd, sec-
retary. The committee’s business is to keep
an eye on London and Continental Art Exhi-
bitions and get in first, if it can, when a
good thing is going. The committee has the
right to spend up to a certain amount with-
out reference to the Sydney Trustees, and
that is as it should be if the new arrange-
ment is to be worth anything.
At Manly last week there was another
“domestic tragedy,” as the daily papers call
those affairs in which the domesticities have
been completely disregarded. Mr. Minchin.
a middle-aged photographer went to stay at
the Steyne Hotel with Mrs. Wittner, the
wife of a friend. After breakfast Mr. Min-
chin remarked to one of the maids that
the weather was “delightful.” Presumably
he meant for assassination purposes, as he
then went upstairs and put tnree bullets
into the lady and one into himself. She is
out of danger, and her husband has expressed
mild wonderment at the whole business. He
was arranging an amicable and respectable
separation at the time it occurred, and had
np idea of the depths of passion in the
photographer’s bosom. Fie looked on Mr.
Minchin as a casual family acquaintance —
not at all the sort of man who was capable
of taking so unwarrantable a liberty.
SONGS OF THE PEOPLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am engaged an songs suitable for vaudeville
audiences. The present is a pathetic ballad which
should have the success of “After the Ball,” which
it really betters in true sentiment. — Author’s note.
Pathetique: con molto expressione.
A woman said “You loved me when we was young
and poor,
When you asked me to be married, jest at me
farver’s door.
You said me eyes wus lovely, and you praised me
golding hair,
Before we grew apart, and you became a millionaire.
You’re after a di-vorce, so a lady you can wed ;
You’re determined to forsyke me as I’ve heard you’ve
often said;
An’ the world thinks we are ’appy, for they do not
know for why:
You only take me out to make... .me... .cry 1
You only take me out to make me cry-y-y-y;
You only take me out to make me cry!
You to play and supper treat me,
And you’re cheerful when you meet me,
But
You only take me out to make me cry.
The world thinks that you’ve always a good husband
to me been,
But only the poor actor knows what’s done behind
the scene;
They do not know you blasted me young heart and
made it dead,
Or what answers you have always to me simple
pleasures said.
At the Governor-General’s dinner you were guilty of
the sin
Of frowning at me when I innercently asked for gin ;
And when we’re going home that night, thro’ the
gaily-lighted park,
You stopped me takin’ off me boots because it
wasn’t dark.
You only take me out to make me cry-y-y-y ;
It’s music to your ears when I do sigh ;
An’ I can’t forgive the sin
Of refusin’ me Square Gin —
You only take me out to make me cry.
If the world can see me diamonds, yet it cannot see
me tears ;
It does not know me torcher through the long and
ginless years ;
It sees me crepe de chine but not the crape around
me heart;
It sees me pearls but not the pearls I weep when
teardrops start;
It does not know you broke me heart and spoiled
me girlish life
By stopping me elopement, just because I am your
wife.
When I consented, with the captain of the fire-
brigade to fly—•
You only take me out to make me cry.
You only take me out to make me cry-y-y-y!
You stopped me when I’d with the fireman fly!
You killed all me hoping
When you stopped me eloping—•
You only take me out to make me cry.

THE NEW MAXWELL
IF there is one lesson that all humanity has learned from the
recent war, it is thrift. Never before has the whole human
race realised so thoroughly its important bearing on the
successful outcome of all human endeavor.
The Maxwell Motor Car, as a genuine thrift car, has taken
its place in a class by itself.
The original price is lower than you would expect. But
the true investment of a Maxwell Car is more apparent to
the owner as the days go by. Its saving of petrol, tyres and
spares is proverbial. It systematically shuns the repair shop.
Many Maxwell owners claim their car will run 30 miles per
gallon of petrol, and that their tyres wear miles longer. Be sure
to see to-day’s Maxwell. Ask the price. You’ll buy it.

ALKALI CAUSES SOAP
TO INJURE HAIR.
Nearly all soaps and ready-mixed shampoos
—even the most expensive—contain too much
alkali, which is dangerous, as it dries the
scalp and makes the hair brittle.
Really the most elegant and safe thing to
use is ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponfled, but quite greaseless liquid), which
is not at all expensive—but is far, far better
than soaps or other scalp-injurious things.
Every chemist keeps a supply of this, and a
few ounces lasts you and mother, sisters and
brothers for months. Just wet the hair with
water and rub it through—thoroughly. One
or two teaspoonsful is plenty to create a big
quantity of rich, heavy, creamy lather. It
cleanses delightfully and rinses out easily.
/i-ioc! nnipiriv and easily, and comes
cieaiiseH ,
The hair dries quickly and easily, and comes
out brilliant, soft, fluffy, wavy and fresh as a
daisy, looking much thicker than it actually
Is.
Best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. And yet
It loosens and carries off every bit of exce. s
oiliness, dust, dirt or dandruff scurf.
PAIN VANISHES! CORNS LIFT OUT

Let To-day’s Corn Pain be Your Last Corn Pain.
Lift Any Corn or Callous Out with Finger-tips.
Wonderful! Girls! Save it a Corner on Dressing-stand.
v*9
SSrv
!|4f
No bunkum! No bother! Corns,
callouses—hard or soft—sore or
sensitive—all yield and loosen
and lift off—absolutely pain-
lessly.
This newly-found com-
pound is named Frozol-
Ice, and is still another
use of that great medi-
cal discovery “ether.”
Stop at any chemist’s for
a little bottle of Frozol-Ice,
costing but a trifle, but which is ample
to free the feet from each and every
corn and callous.
Apply some drops on to a delicate
corn or callous. Like a Hash the soreness
vanishes, and soon the corn or callous peels
right off with the finger-tips.
Frozol-Ice is absolutely non-irritant, doesn’t
even inflame the surrounding healthy flesh.
Just fancy! No agony at all, no sting or sore-
ness while using, or afterwards, simply a
shrivelling, drying up of corns and callouses.
Girls! Save a corner on your dressing-
table for Frozol-Ice, and never be the “wall-
flower” of the ballroom again. Just some
drops of Frozol-Ice when corns begin aching.
Pain disappears—corn dies !
True Frozol-Ice is flattered by worthless
imitations. Avoid them by insisting on the
green label.
Magnesia Baths for
Dyspeptic Stomachs.
How They Neutralise or Take Up the
Dangerous Stomach Acids Which
Cause indigestion.
Physicians agree that nearly nine-tenths of the cases
of stomach trouble, dyspepsia and indigestion are
caused by an excess of hydrochloric acid in the
stomach. “Acid Stomach” is an exceedingly danger-
ous condition because the acid irritates and inflames
the delicate stomach walls and lining, causing the
partially digested food to sour and ferment and
develop gas, bloat, nausea and heartburn.
Acid stomachs should be neutralised. Do not treat
with digestive pills or drugs, but give the stomach
a magnesia bath to clean out the dangerous acid
accumulation and then all pain and discomfort will
quickly stop.
To give the stomach a genuine magnesia bath go
to any chemist’s shop and get some pure Salix Mag-
nesia powder and take a teaspoonful in a cup of
hot or cold water. This makes an agreeable drink,
and washes down into your acid-inflamed and burn-
ing stomach, where in less than 10 minutes, it soothes
and cools the heated walls and takes up or neutral-
ises every trace of excess acid, much as a sponge or
blotting paper might do. With the removal of the
acid from the stomach every symptom of indigestion
will stop. Salix Magnesia baths are being taken
daily by thousands of former dyspeptics who now
eat as they please-without a sign of indigestion.

“Cosmop.”: Concerning Harry Rickards
and the old show r man’s expansive style of
doing things (B. 29/l/’2O). My mind goes
back to a valedictory to the melancholy
Northcote prior to his departure to take
up the G.-G. job in Australia. The gathering
took place in the Freemasons’ Tavern, Lon-
Gorman, the sing-
ing parson, at
Melbourne Bijou.
don. Lewis Waller,
fresh from “Monsieur
Beaucaire,” had just
finished a stirring bit
of Kipling when the
magnificent ’Arry was
detected in the .room.
Loud cries ' immedi-
ately went up for him ;
and the louder the
crowd clapped and
called (it was getting
on to 11.30) the more
radiant the Great One
looked. At last amil
deafening applause he
rose. “Your Royal
Highness and gentle-
men,” he said, “I
cawn’t sing to-night
because the fawg has
caught me in the
throat, but I thank
you from the bottom
of my heart for this
great reception. When
the Right Honorable
gentleman comes out
to Orstralier I’ll be
glad to see him at my
little show at the
Tivoli, where he’ll get
the welcome of his
life from yours sin-
cerely ’Airry Riek-
ards.” That speech was the hit of the night.
“Norbell”: “Ancient Prompter’s” story of
how the printer made it “She Strips to Con-
quer” reminds me of the time we were doing
“Camille” at Mount Morgan (Q.). The
publicity fiend had given it the sub-title “A
Story of Immortal Youth.” The printer’s
inspiration made it “A Story of Immoral
Youth!” and packed the house.
“Vaudeville Vet.”: Whether or not the
Schwarz Bros, elaborated an old idea in
the mirror business, the fact remains that
their clever elaboration has been pinched
wholesale, and I maintain that the inventor
of even a variation is entitled to protection.
I saw the Schwarz Bros.’ act used in Yankee
burlesque, and I recently .spotted it on the
screen and in a so-called revue in Sydney.
There is nothing new in mirrors in vaude-
ville, but there was a great deal new in the
way the Schwarz pair used them. Perhaps
the most novel use of a mirror.for trick pur-
poses in vaudeville occurred in the act of
My Fancy, the expensive dancer who came
here over 20 years ago. When the curtain
rose she was seen bowing to the audience.
There was a sudden blotting out of the figure
and simultaneously the dancer clogged on
from the wings. Of course the first revelation
of My Fancy was merely a reflection. But
in these days of high freights some manage-
ments would tell the inventive little lady to
cut the glassware out.
“Bally-ho”: Mrs. General Mite, who died
in Christchurch (M.L.) recently, had a
large-sized reputation in the show world,
although her height was only 39in. She was
introduced to British Royalty at Marl-
borough House, where Queen Victoria saw a
show every week, and in ’B5 she visited Bis-
marck, and also the kings of Saxony and
Hanover. In ’B9 the King and Queen of
Spain made a fuss over her. She was forty-
odd at her death, and weary of the show busi-
ness. Hayati Hassid, who was even smaller
than Mrs. Mite, left Australia after some
disastrous law experiences, and in 1917 went
to America, where he was offered plenty of
engagements. He preferred to settle down

out of public vision, however. Sinatra Singh
llpoo, another immaculate little chap, who
weighed 291 b., also came to Australia, lie
was an absolutely perfect specimen of minia-
ture man, and his strength for his size was
formidable. He was an ardent wooer. I
first saw him having a real Oriental picnic
amid a couple of hundred ballet-girls m the
big dressing-room at Circus Busch, Berlin.
In Australia he spent his money lavishly and
entertained half a dozen full-sized ladies at
a time. Diedrich Ulpts was a more intel-
lectual midget visitor. He was a German,
under 4ft., and narrowly escaped internment
here. Ulpts contributed socialistic, articles
of an inflammatory nature to Berlin news-
papers. He married a normal-sized woman,
and his eldest son used to sit pa on the
mantelshelf.
“Obadiah” : Apropos families sharing their
talents among various managements. Leslie
Holland didn’t exactly wax fat, yet he waxed
affluent, under the J.C.W. banner, and
showed the way to brother Ellis, who is
doing nicely with Mclntosh. Now, at Sydney
Alhambra, which is regaining some of its
early prestige, a third brother, Ralph,
appears. He will have the juvenile leads in
the John F. Sheridan musical plays which
Philip Lytton has suddenly released from
his store of scripts and sold to Pugliese, who
is as game as you make ’em.

“S.”: George Rignold was the most cyni-
cal actor I ever met. “All this rubbish about
State theatres!” said he. “Isn’t there the
monkey-house at the Zoo already?” One
Sunday night he entered the drawing-room
of a brother pro. in a Melbourne suburb,
and discovered no less than seven well-
known actors. “My G —d!” said George.
“What potentiality for a fight!” “So you
are Handsome George?” said a lady to whom
he had been introduced during his
last season with Bland Holt. “Madam,”
he replied, “I, have been, and I may-
be again—after the resurrection.” One
night in Harry Rickards’s time he
sat with some friends in a box at
the Opera House watching Irving Sayles
sweating at work. Somebody- said the coon
was anxious to appear as Othello. “So he
should.” commented Rignold. “His skin acts
beautifully.”
“Snell”: “Kissing Time” has no more
commonsense than the average musical
comedy, or revue, or pantomime (they’re all
alike) ; yet it is much more deserving than
ordinary, inasmuch as its folly is cleverly-
tempered to the baldhead by the excellence
of its legs, the artistic choice and variety of
its trimming® the glory of its clothes (when
it has any), the mild excellence of a quan-
tity of nice little songs, the sweet ingenu-
ousness of Maud Fane, the neatness and
finish of Gladys Moncrieff, and finally and
triumphantly the delayed sun-burst of extra-
vagant dancing by Louise Larsson, with It.
Jackson as a sort of human pivot. Here
are the unfailing elements of success for an
entertainment of the sort, nlways procur-
able, usually quite adjacent to the Austra-
lian producer. Why-, then, are there ever
any failures? It is always possible to get
songs of the neat minor quality of these ; a
dancer who can hurl herself- about in the
air with grace, and twinkle her limbs to a
set tune, is never wholly absent from the
local field of vision; comedy like that of
Leonard and Leslie Holland, and sugary
amiability and sustained melodiousness like
that of Miss Fane, if not a drug in the
market, are invariably within reach; and
clothes-designers and dress materials can be
got for love and money. Why then do we
sometimes get musical plays in which these
elements are missing, or short of satisfac-
tory? Nothing lifts a flagging entertain-
ment like the sudden rush of a dainty dancer
in an effort in which grace, elegance, color,
knees and tempestuous vigor blend with
courageous grotesquerie: vet how few and
far between are such brain storms of terpsi-
chorean art!
Dear Bulletin, —Eardley Turner’s “Dream
of Strange Boostings” (B. 29/l/’2O) hits
a lars-e nail on its head. The Americans
have reduced the art of “sub-conscious”
advertising to a science. We pay them for
the privilege of singing about “Tennessee,”
“Michigan,” “Mississippi,” “Missouri,”
“Dixie,” etc., and their genius for catchy
music is our only excuse. There’s ample
scope in this “little old Australia” for drama
and comedy. At present a playwright knows
it’s useless to attempt to turn Australia into
song or story; yet if there’s a loud enough
call for Australian stuff the managements
will come to heel. Hat’s off to the Ameri-
cans for their cleverness in compelling us
to advertise them; but surely, in raisin' mu-
hats we can also clear our heads to absorb
the lessons they teach.—Yours, Db < •
“E.T.”: Australia’s Marcus Super! ns has
by latest advices gone into musical comedy.
He has a part in “Our Peg,” a new version
of the Woffington tale. Presumably our own
Julius is not called upon to sing 01 dam e.
His task will be to take the centre and look
a “picture” in the costume of the period.
The new piece, by the way, was on the
boards of the Prince’s, Manchester, during
the Christmas holidays.
“C. Oekney”: Oscar Asche, at a recent
O.P. Club dinner in London, let the company
into the secret of the record-breaking “Chu
Chin Chow.” In 1915, during a whole week
of rain in Manchester, he took up his pen
in desperation, and for a joke started con-
cocting a pantomime on the subject of “The
Forty Thieves.” He completed it there and
then, and when he got to London, after
having it musicked and scenery designed
for it, offered it to various West End man-
agements, who do the light musical stuff.
All said “No good!” He then suggested to
Dana, Tree’s manager, that he should, put
it up at Her Majesty’s, where that other
big winner, “Kismet,” had been refused.
Said Dana, “If you put parts in it for your-
self and wife, Oscar, we might consider it.”
Replied Asche: “My wife and I play Shaks-
peare, not pantomime.” “There’s always a
chance to rise,” said Dana. So Asche went
home and decided to write the two parts in.
Soon afterwards “Chu” was staged at Tree’s
playhouse, and has stayed there ever since.
“Playfair”: That’s a damnable implica-
tion in the remarks of “'Pish Tush” (B.
5/2/’2O). in spite of his saving clauses. “It
was whispered,” he says, “that the two or
three critics who refused to fit Leonard with
the halo of George Lauri had had their hos-
tility stirred in advance by a whisper from
the management.” Even though “Pish Tush”
listens to whispers, he ought to know that
managerial murmurs would have no influ-
ence on the critic or the criticism of any
paper that really matters. To do the man-
agements justice, in a long experience as
critic, I have never known them to attempt
anything of the kind. And if they did they
would meet with a freezing lack of success.
Any genuine critic is very careful of his
own honor and of the honor of his paper.

rich all of a sudden,
I know what to do; I

price in my vicinity,

tions in “manner,” it

.a certain ingratiating
quality is necessary to
popularity, and one
has to be a popular
waiter to enjoy the
full tide of tips. There
is a tableside as well
as a bedside manner,
it seems.
“Blackout”: There is one little letter over
which the actress who affects "society” tones
often comes a cropper. The trouble is that
she doesn’t give a “d.” For instance, one
was recently remarking. “I recognised him
immeejutly” (fortunately she didn’t say
“reekernised”). And another confided to
her friend and the audience that “It upset
me tremendously.”
"This Way, Madam” : The distinction be-
tween musical plays and drapery shops tends
to disappear entirely. In the fashion dis-
play- known as “Kissing Time” the leading
female character is even named after a
dress material —Georgette. One of the men
behind “Kissing xime” in London has a
large interest in a dress business. I have
often wondered whether interests in theatres
and in dranery businesses are not similarly
mixed in Melbourne. Many signs would seem
to indicate that they are.
“Ox” : The keenest theatrical fight X. S.
Wales country districts have seen is about to
begin. W. Newton Carroll and Philip
Lytton, long established in a dramatic way,
have also a pantomime apiece this season.
Both pantos, and the legit, play under can-
vas, and will battle with each other at the
agricultural shows.
“Ivaylee”: Wasn’t, it Geo. C. Miln (B.

across the stage from wing to wing? The
idea was to protect himself from the eggs
and other instruments of destruction which
he said he deserved if what the critics said
of the show was true.
Charles Coborn, who made a success nearly

at one time. Pirates robbed him in this

Bawn” and “The Octoroon” in 1860. He
opened in Sydney, and both plays were
pinched and played in Melbourne before he
could go south. Wheatley was broken-
hearted and took the first sailing vessel back
home to America.
“Norbell”: John Haines was the most
absent-minded mummer I ever met. John, a
mild-mannered, fatherly old chap, was at the
time stage-managing “The rtole Survivor” as
well as playing Samson Fox, a sort of second
heavy. He was “holding the book” in the
prompt entrance and faithfully following
every word. Presently there came an omin-
ous pause in a tense situation. John peered
through his specs at the people in waiting
off stage, and cooed entreatingly, “Now, now.
laddie, Samson Fox’s cue’s vone. Where
are you, laddie? Come on, Samson Fox!”
Then he suddenly remembered, and trotted
on stage, still holding the script, and apologis-
ing blandly, “Sorry, sorry! Of course, of
course, how silly of me! I’m Samson Fox
myself!”
THE MUMMER’S FAMILY GOES THROUGH IT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s a horrible time in the actor’s home,
When father’s learning his part;
It’s a kind of a circus and hippodrome,
When father’s learning his part;
For hell chase the dog—oh, he’s awful contrairy—
And kick the cat, and curse the canary,
And he’s got more hump than a dromedary,
When father’s learning his part.
Mum creeps around like a timorous mouse
When father’s learning his part,
He wants straw down in front of the house,
When father’s learning his part;
For the slightest sound “puts him off” his study,
And he says what’s left of his brain goes muddy,
And his language is frequent and free and ruddy,
When father’s learning his part,
We know the villain has met his doom;
When father’s learning his part.
By the awful sounds from the sitting-room,
When father’s learning his part;
“Take that!” he will shout, “you base malapert,
you!”
Then: “Look up, my darling, there’s no one shall
hurt you'!”
And Mum weeps, although it’s the Triumph of Virtue,
When father’s learning his part!
Ha d luck for the tradesman who comes with a bill
When father’s learning his part !
For he swears any callers to instantly kill,
When father’s learning his part.
So we tie up the knocker and shiver in dread.
And the neighbors all say “He’s not right in his
head,”
And Life is a blank, and we wish we were dead
When father’s learning his part.
VICTORIA.

On the invitation of Mr. Eric F. Boult, Attorney
for Australia for Wolseley Cars, Limited, a meeting
was held in Scott’s Hotel, Collins Street, on the
28th ult. for the purpose of celebrating the appoint-
ment of Messrs. Dalgety & Co., Ltd., as Victorian
Agents for Wolseley Motors, Limited. The chair was
taken by Mr. Boult, who proposed the toast of the
King, after which Mr. E. E. Wagstaff (British
Imperial Oil Co.), proposed the toast of Wolseley
Motors, Limited, to which Mr. Boult responded. In
the course of his remarks he mentioned that Wolseley
Limited was a combination of Wolseley Limited and
Vickers Limited, and at the time of the combination
the only output was 1000 cars. By 1914 this had
increased to 3000 cars. In the year 1919 and 1920,
in spite of moulders and other strikes, and apart
altogether from war materials and munitions that
the Company' had turned Out for the Imperial authori-
ties the output of cars had increased to 20,000. Mr.
Boult emphasised the fact that £ s. d. would not
in any way stand in the way of the advancement oi
the firm nor the treatment of hands. He outlined
the general policy of the firm to the various Agents
in other States for the firm and strongly emphasised
the fact that the firm stood for square dealing to all.
Two of the Directors of Messrs. Dalgety & Co., Ltd.,
also spoke.—Advt.
Carbine’s son Defence, now a 10-year-old,
did the books a good turn by snatching the 11-
furlongs event at Caulfield last Saturday from the
jaws of another rank outsider in Wildun. A lot
of money was chopped over Menin and others for
the same race, so there was merit in the perform-
ance of evergreen Defence, notwithstanding that the
three-year-old was giving him 121 b. Evidently the
stable reckoned him too much above himself in
condition to see the journey quite out, even with a
trifle only on his back. And the public had almost
forgotten that the offspring of Carbine and Pola
won the Australian Cup two years ago with a heavier
weight than he carried on Saturday. It was the
old story of a gelding' being most dangerous when
he has some good solid flesh sticking to Iris ribs.
Defence, of late, has been looking jolly for an old’un,
and though he can be considerably hardened before
Australian Cup day without being disimproved (dis-
imprpvement being often the result of winding-up
gallops, especially with geldings), he will never have
more ginger and determination than he showed on
Saturday. All going well, lie will doubtless have
some sort of a say in the last half-mile of the Cup ;
yet the old chap is not very likely to register a
second victory in the long event. Wildun, who ran

him to a head on Saturday, and would meet him on
241 b. better terms in the Cup, might be tipped to
win the prize if he had the cut and the breed of a
sticker. As a son of Eudorus and Lady Malster,
however, he hasn't a staying pedigree. Of those
that finished behind him imported Meni.n seems most
worth consideration for the Cup he was placed in last
autumn. All the same, Menin may be said to have
performed thusfar like the most over-rated gee in
the country. He is always going to do something
better than he does. And his poor feet are never
quite right, it seems. Yet, though not a tempting
proposition, his chance must be taken seriously.
Visibility, son of well-remembered Trafal-
gar, won a two-year-old race at Caulfield last
Saturday, after running badly 011 two or three
occasions when heavily hacked. The filly had only
a lot of overworked commoners to beat, but she strode
home in comparatively queenly style, and may yet
prove that Trafalgar is not a dead failure as a sire.
The difference between Trafalgar and his old opponent
Comedy King has been very marked since they both
went to the stud. Neither of them would have
been picked on his make and shape to shine in the
paternity line, hut descendants of Corned}* King are
winning all over the place, whilst the champion
whom he happened to beat by a neck for the Mel-
bourne Cup has been in a measure dimming his
turf reputation by poor performances in the harem.

Saturday is the first of two Y.A.T.C. days
which are followed by the Autumn meeting at
Flemington. The Oakleigh Plate this time promises
to present an unusual element of debate in the shape
of a flying two-year-old, no juvenile having landed
the 5-J furlongs flutter since long, long ago. For
the last three years in sucession the Oakleigh was a
close guide to the Newmarket result, despite the
theory that the straight six furlongs at Flemington
are hard to travel for sprinters that can do the short
Caulfield course easily enough. Last year Molly’s
Robe won the Newmarket after running second at
Caulfield. Poitrina, in 1918, reversed this order of
things. In the previous year Headwind was second
for both events, and Amata, the Newmarket winner
in 1916, had been placed for the Oakleigh twelve
months earlier. But conditions have changed, and
it seems that punters are not looking to the Oakleigh
; to throw a fierce light on the more important ques-
tion. For one thing, Etive, who never fails to get
away in a hurry, looks an almost good enough
youngster to scamper away with the stake under
the comparatively luxurious burden of 7st. 81b. Of
course there is no saying how bad the other juveniles
may have been in the races that Etive won ; there-
fore this young iiier’s chance against older sprinters
is just a matter of guesswork. At time of writing
Etive is said to be sure to g'o to the barrier with
Bobby Lewis up, and a lot of people will he sorely
disappointed if the chestnut filly doesn’t at least
make most of the running ere she is collared.
Among the gees less likely to g'et away in front a
smart and daring young jockey will count for more
than one who considers risks in rounding the turn.
Dempsey’s mount, for instance, will have a lot of
followers.
Surveyor, wlio proved such a holy frost on
this side of the Tasman, takes to the game more
kindly in the Rickety Isles. He has just been
credited with the Taranaki (M.L.) Cup (lfin.),
wherein he received nearly a stone from Karo,
another disappointment in Australia.
At Albion Park (Q.) the Purse went to
a grandson of Positano in Mariston (Orcus —Vic-
toria). 111 this race jockey Mortleman, who has
just returned to the saddle, fell off Don Scorv.
Oreus, who cost 3050 guineas as a yearling, is going
to prove a great success at the stud in Bananaland,
judging by the showing of his stock this season.
The Plate at the same meeting was rightly judged
a good thing for the consistent Rappel King.
The Musket strain was much in evidence
at Williamstown (Vic.) on Saturday, when the two-
year-old Handicap went to Visibility by Trafalgar,
the Wyndham Handicap to Defence by Carbine, and
the Welter to Clan Fingan by Wallace.
The Adelaide colt Seal King (Green Seal
■ —Cuckoo), who won the Burnside Handicap
6fur), at the Adelaide Foundation Meeting in
lmin. 1.31 sec., carrying 9st. 21b., must have a good
look in in the Newmarket witli 6st. 101 b. He is
only a little fellow, but he won’t be subject to bump-
ing in the straight six furlongs.
Lance Goyder, South Aus.’s youngest
trainer, has been killed while riding United Ally at
early-morning work on the Victoria Park course. He
was a grandson of the former Surveyor-General of
S.A., and started training only a year ago, after
a successful career as amateur jockey.

On the Ballarat racecourse last week W.
Hymes’s well-known horse Malto raced an aeroplane
for a prize of £25, the conditions being that the
’plane was to circle the racing track (about one
mile) four'times while the nag was going round once.
It proved an easy thing for Malto, although odds of
20 to one were offered against the prad. Before the
plane had done a round and a half Malto had finished
half the journey, and after a rapid trot up the
straight passed the post about three furlongs ahead
of the machine.

There was a tremendous entry for the
bowls championship of Adelaide. Apparently the
result is thought to be largely a matter of luck, for
a dozen or more entered from each cltib; and Le
Cornu, the holder, was put out at an early stage.
The last four left in were Bower and Mack of the
Drive Club, Lance Addison of the Oval, and Miller
of West Park. In the final Miller heat the veteran
Bower, 31 to 27. The lighting restrictions, which
have begun again in Adelaide, owing to coal shortage,
will interfere badly with bowls, evening play by
electric light being now almost universal.
Intermittent rain affected the tennis match
between Vic. and the British Isles at Albert Ground.
Yet there was some capital play. Wood beating
Beamish (6 —3, 7—5) and Kingseote walloping
Wertlieim (6 —3, 6 —o). Wood’s aggressive net
work, wherein he could use his low fast volleys, was
too much for Beamish, even when he held a great
lead (5 —2) in the second go and wanted only another
game to capture the set. Though Kingseote would
necessarily outplay Wertheim, the towering Vic-
torian weakly fed the Englishman’s forehand and
almost doubled the latter’s offensiveness. In the doubles
Kingseote and Lowe were being hard pushed when
the heavens intervened. Saturday’s rain knocked the
programme to pieces and only the doubles, Kingseote
and Beamish v. Hawkes and O’Hara Wood, was
decided on a court which was too sodden for decent
play and early tumbled both Victorians flat on their
backs. In the circumstances none of the players
could give of their best; but admitting that the
disadvantages were equal for everybody, the Davis
Cup pair needed something more than the weather
to explain their defeat by three sets to one. The
young > ictol ians’ work is shown by the record
(6 —4, 6—3, 6 —B, 6—2), the visitors having to
fight very hard for the third set after leading with
three games to love. The juvenile Hawkes as usual
dominated the court, and some of his finest Saves
had the added sting of returning wickedly just out
of reach. Beamish was next best, scoring repeatedly
with a beautiful backhand drive along the side line.
Kingseote began to blush for his errors, and O’Hara
Wood was frequently rattled by the service and
rarely shone at. the net.
On the final day of the Australasian A.A.
championships at Sydney a heavy track precluded
any alterations in the record-book. The advantage
of being able to start three in each event enhanced
N. S. Wales’ chances, and they landed four out of
the seven. So N. S. Males takes the shield with
seven points as against four each to M.L. and Vic.
Queensland and S. Australia failed to score. The
sprinting of W. W. Hunt was again the star item,
and he won the 220yds. by half-a-dozen yards in
22 2-ssec. —the fastest time since Nigel Barker
(N.S.W.) put up 21 l-ssec. in 1905. R. G. Piggott
(N.S.W.) and A. W. Dormer (M.L.) fought out the
880yds., Piggott ultimately snapping the worsted
two yards ahead in 2min. 2 2-ssec. N.S.W. filled all
the places in the three miles run; the order being
(1) H. Grandemange (15min. 54 l-ssec.) ; (2) J.
W Cain (3) H. L. Sheaves. The mile walk resulted
(1) G. R. Parker (6min. 49sec.), (2) E. Austen, (3)
R. F. Stokes; and all of them hailed from the Ma
State likewise.
For the jumping events, the high wind rocked the
bar in awkward fashion. Under the conditions, there
was much to be said for the leap of the long-legged
H W. Harbison (Vic.), who got over sft. Bin., while
J K. Harbison and W. J. Potter (both of N.S.W.)

A remarkable feature
was the reckless disrepair
of many of the athletes’
knickers. Another was
the lack of coaching and
bad shoeing, both of which
tore seconds off the times
of those affected.
Dick Coombes, recently appointed chair-
man of the Australian and Maoriland athletic
union for the 23rd year in succession, has bee 1
fostering athletics in Australia for 46 years. He has
been with Sydney Referee since its first issue, about
35 years ago, and he is regarded in the office as
superior to any encyclopaedia on most questions. He
will go with the Australian Olympic team to Belgium
this year as manager.

The “Yankee” cyclists (who are mostly
Australians) picked up some more money at Sydney
on Saturday. In the Golden Wheel (two miles) Bob
Spears won from Alf Grenda and Hans Ohrt; an
American team of six defeated Australia in a pur-
suit race, covering 6J miles in 15min. ; Grenda
accounted for Spears in a mile match race in two
straight heats; and Frank Corry won the mile
handicap in 2min. 2sec.

Never in the history of the Sydney
Stadium has a boxer bounded into such instant popu-
larity as Digger Evans did on Saturday night. By
the time the first round of his contest with Jackie
Green was over, the approval of the multitude (and
the big place was packed to the roof) surpassed in
uproariousness anything that had ever greeted even
Darcy. For one thing, Evans is in appearance a
kind of composite of all the Diggers that ever
fought. His keen, relentless face, with its well-
developed jaw and brows, and its crafty, resourceful
eyes, represents everything that has spelt “Australian”
for Europe in recent years. And he fights in the
Digger style—furiously, yet with the utmost cun-
ning. His defiant grin-—never broader than when
fie had just collected a series of terrific wallops—-
lasted from the beginning of the fight to its end.
Odds of six to one had been laid freely on the
wonderful little Sydney boy; in fact, Green was
said to have backed himself to out Evans within five
rounds. The bantam champion fought a great and
game battle, but he was dominated practically
throughout by the Digger, who is as much a genius
in the ring as Gregory is on the cricket field. His
best punch is a straight right. It is delivered with
cat-like speed and has the whole force of his in-
moving body behind it. He hooks at short range
with his more or less maimed left arm, and he also
uses it with great effect on the body. His evasion
work was equal to Green’s: it is impossible to say
more. Half-way through the disturbance Evans’s
head accidentally bumped Green’s left eyebrow and
laid it open. The blood handicapped the champion ;
and lie handicapped himself, later, by making several
exasperated appeals to the referee in connection with
imaginary fouls. Evans made prompt and deadly
use of iiis opponent’s momentarily relaxed effort.
By the 20th round Green was all out, and a long
way behind on points. It had been evident from the
16th onward that, bar miracles, Evans must get the
decision.
Alf. Felton got a tremendous reception a few
minutes before the fight began. The vast smilin'*
sergeant looks bulkier than when he went'away, lie
is the same honest sportsman ; and if Barry doesn't
get every legitimate chance to beat him when they
row on the Parramatta next September, it won’t In
Felton’s fault. Barry offered to get him an in-
creased meat and sugar ration during his trainin'* j n
England. A country which produces its own food
can hardly appreciate ail that that means in Free-
trade England nowadays.
Sydney -grade cricketers had to get through
the eighth round in one afternoon and in consequence
of the forced play—a treat to watch —some of the
under-dogs upset calculations. Notably in the Glebe
v. Middle Harbor match, where, largely owing to
the efforts of Kelleway (five for 23) and Gray (fl ve
for 35), the haughty surfites failed by 57 runs to
reach the rank outsiders’ score. Gordon’s rotten
team play against C. Cumberland landed them with
a draw after victory had knocked at their gate. For
the orchardists Gar Waddy (68) hit hard and often
as of old; he was assisted by rejuvenated Crannev
The side strung together 189 for nine. When time
came Gordon, with four down, had but 164. Down’s
painfully slow 68 was a monument of mistaken
tactics. For Balmain Wall (five for 58) and Folkartl
(five for 47), assisted by a drying pitch, put Waverlev
through for 158 runs, whereof Hendry got 66 (thanks
to some assistance from the field), and Levy 43.
Balmain topped this easily ; in fact eight men were
done out of their strike. Thomas (94) and McCoy
(63 n. 0.) got most of the runs. Uni. and Paddington
played a draw. Pad. apparently forgetting that it
was not a three-day match, waited till 234 (for
seven) went up before declaring. Norman spurned
the local talent to the extent of 106 n.o.—the only
three-figure contribution of the afternoon. Uni. were
six down for 89 when the umpires murmured
“Enough!” Petersham beat Sydney by only 25 runs.
On eacii side a bowler struck a patch, but Pete, pro-
duced a batsman who made all the difference.
Andrews in the course of his 90 n.o. showed cold
contempt for Collins (five for 51). Sydney’s 112
failed to reveal batting talent when opposed to
Garner (seven for 49), whose bowling was ably
assisted by a wicket which literally fell to pieces.
Norths and Wests played an even draw. For the
ferry-trippers King made 87 (n. 0.) in a stylish if
over-risky innings. Young McElhone’s 40 (n. 0.) was
a finished display. Prentice for Wests shone alone
and his 75 included six sixes. The fielding on both
sides was wretched. So was the ground.
Bowlers had a picnic in Melbourne District
cricket on Saturday. The best total of the after-
noon was Richmond's nine for 165 (declared closed)
against North, Richardson making 76 not out. On
tile moist wicket cut up by the Richmond innings
North did pretty well with three for 63. St. Hilda
against Melbourne closed with nine for 119, Iron-
monger knocking over six for 53, and Melbourne so
far have lost four for 50. In the match between
P’ran and Northeote Gibaud of the latter team
finished the day with a harvest of 10 for 57. P’ran’s
first try yielded 149, and N’cote, scoring 83 for
eight, closed and sent P’ran in again. It was a
good move, for the shopkeepers fell heavily—seven
for 57. University expired early with a total of 74;
Essendon are already ahead, with seven for 104.
Essendon’s bowler, Mullett, had seven for 30 against
his name, and through a dropped catch he just
missed the hat trick. However, he got two more
victims with the next two balls, which is probably
near the record for destruction. Fitzroy, with three
for 91, hope that good weather next Saturday will
enable them to beat Carlton’s 138. East v. Colling-
wood stands adjourned at an interesting stage. East’s
star bowler, McNaughton, launched an offensive, and,
getting seven for 35, did most to dismiss ’Wood for
72. After losing two for 94 (Baring 61 n. 0.) East
retired and gave ’Wood another turn. At 6.30 ’Wood
were four for 64.
Norman Ross and Frank Beaurepairc met
for the third time at Brunswick (Melb.) Baths on
Saturday afternoon. The struggle was for the 220yds.
championship of Victoria. The water here is fresh,
and the baths have a swimming length of 60yds.,
so the men did three laps and 40yds. to make the
distance. Over the first lap Ross pushed his brawny
frame in advance of Bogey and Ivan Stedman, the
Vic. sprint champion, aind at the turn and push-off
from the wall he pipped the locals, though Bogey
always made up leeway in the immediate strokes
after his push-away. The first hundred went behind
in 59 l-ssec. A stiff fight occurred in the second
hundred, Ross securing a slight advantage; but
Bogey rose to the occasion and at the last kick-off
for home headed the Yank. The big man made a
tremendous effort, and, hurling his porpoise-like
frame at the rope on the very death-knock, got the
judge’s decision by something like a foot. Time,
2niin. 28 l-ssec. Beaurepaire’s figures were given as
28 3-10 sec. The third and only other starter, Sted-
man, finished some four yards away. Bogey is im-
proving at every swim, and in the deep salt, over
anything from 220yds. upwards, he should prove the
Yankee’s master. They meet next in Adelaide, where
the conditions are—open baths and a long lap.
At the end, in the 440yds. race, Ross was 10yds.
to the good; time, smin. 19 4-ssec. It was a
stroke-for-stroke battle over the first 200yds., and
Ross got there just ahead in 2min. llsec. Beaure-
paire has trained down to his swimming weight—
lOst. 21b. His height is sft. 7in. Ross is 6ft. and
14 stone. By the way, it is ridiculous to contest any
sort of swimming Championship in a dead-water bath
with no less than 13 turns.

A terrible lot of good English money must
have crossed over to France when Carpentier knocked
Beckett out in half a round. For some unknown rea-

THE DEAD HEAD SPORTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A large party of about 30 members of the State
Parliament will leave Melbourne on February 6 for
Sydney to engage N. S. Wales members in various
.sports.”
When you are bending to your desk, or, with a pick
or spade,
Endeavoring to earn the wage which weekly you are
paid,
It should encourage you a lot to know that you can
boast
About the Statesmen Sports of whom you are the
lavish host.
The life you lead yourself may be austere, and dull
as well —
A grim, unending struggle to defeat the H.C.L..
Take heart, however, at the thought that this is
what defrays
The cost of the diversions of our festive M.L.A.’s.
Reflect, as you are trudging home, that in some
special train
A laughing legislative band is hurrying amain.
With whisky and cigars of unexamjded excellence,
To have a dashed good time —and all of it at your
expense!
And when you go to bed at night, imagine them at
play !
The cries of “Bowled!” “Not out!” “Well hit!”
the level turf and gay!
And you will thrill with kindly joy to think that
though, ’tis true,
You may not call the tune, yet still the piper’s paid
by you.
Let no one after this announce with Spartacist dis-
dain
That he and his, abjuring swank, decline “to enter-
tain.”
Our Dead-head Sports attend to that: the voter has
no say ;
The members give the parties, the constituencies pay.

SCIENCE v. BRUTE STRENGTH
Whenever the two clash “science” is
an “odds-on” winner. It has been
proved times out of number in the
ring. Superior science and speed
enabled the slim Frenchman Carpentier
to “out” England’s burly champion in
one round recently, and the same kind
of thing is of common occurence in
Australia. Nine times out of ten, if
a quarrel is forced upon you it is by
a blustering bully who, confident of
his own weight and strength, rushes
headlong at what he considers an
easy mark.
You can beat him by SCIENCE if
you are a keen student of my course of
BOXING BY POST
• —and beat him without much trouble to yourself.
The easy “side-step” and “back move,” the quick,
snappy punch scientifically delivered —and the bully
is put where he belongs. Every “point” of the
game—footwork, punching, countering and blocking,
are exhaustively dealt with, and so clearly defined
by word and picture that you simply cannot help
learning to become a skilled boxer if you follow the
instructions.
Write for my illustrated booklet “SCIENTIFIC
BOXING IN YOUR HOME,” which gives full par-
ticulars of my method, cost of tuition, etc. Just

“L.S.” JUDHPORES, 32/6
TAILOR-MADE TO ORDER
THE Judhpore is a combination of the ideas responsible
for the production of Riding Breeches and Riding
Trousers of the usual design. With Judhpores you get
the fullness at the thighs and almost the same close fitting
at the knees as are features of Riding Breeches of regu-
lation pattern. No leggings are needed. The design
obviates the necessity of using laces or buttons at the
knee. The garments can be pulled on as quickly and
easily as ordinary Riding Trousers. You therefore get
also the commendable features of the latter.
There is no doubt as to the handiness of Judhpores, and
they have more than justified their great popularity in
Australia.
We quote our “L.S.” Special Judhpores in Military
Drills at 32/6, tailor-made to order. Other materials art
obtainable up to £4.

For the investiture at Federal Govern-
ment House on Friday evening the guests,
mostly friends of the victims, arrived early,
and by schedule time they were all appro-
priately mute and waiting in the ballroom.
A few who arrived just on time found the
rest of the big house brilliantly lighted,
but as deserted and silent as the Sleeping
Beauty’s palace. Under the canopy stood
the G.-G. with all his gold braid blazing.
Lady Helen was with him in dusky chiffon
draperies lit with a single row of huge dia-
monds round her head. General Sellheim,
senior military, A.D.C., stood at his
Ex.’s right elbow and provided the sword
for slapning the patients on their shoulders,
lie narrowly escaped beheading newspaper
knight Langxlon Bonytlmn.
The victims had to march up many yards
of red carpet, and all of them had a hang-
dog look. It would be much more effective
if juvenile leads were engaged for this part
of tne show. An aide danced before the
victims with the bauble or decoration on a
cushion. Some of them approached in threes
and the combined effort of keeping step,
hooking their eyes on his Ex., and subduing
their self-consciousness made their brows
glisten. The onlookers stood in two solid
banks on either side of the carpet and gazed
in dead silence.
The youngest Australian general, H'. W.
Lloyd, got his C.B. This is slung on a
collar, and the G.-G. put the red ribbon
necklet on lop-sided. Young Mrs. Lloyd,
watching from near by, was in an agony
of anxiety about it until General Tivey put
it straight. No woman can bear to see her
lord with his necktie crooked. Mrs, Ilig-
gall wore her most expensive gown and
most expansive smile while Ljeut.-Col. Rig-
gall, D. 5.0., bagged his C.M.G. Three
scarlet and grey nurses with snowy caps
advanced for the R.R.C. They were Matron
Pritchard, Sister Bolton and Sister Hart.
Australians who had been decorated in
England said. “There was no fuss and frill
like this at Buckingham Palace.”
When the job had been done the party
broke up for supper—an elaborate affair of
chicken and champagne. rJverybody stood
up to the food like travellers at a railway
buffet. The G.-G. and Lady Helen, the
Irvines and Birdwood stood at the end of
the centre table. The hardy Monash was
there; and daughter Bertha shone in a
lemon-colored frock. Mrs. - Godfrey Cass
(heroine of the Coxiant movies) also wore a
lemon-tinted top and amber earrings. Mrs.
Arthur Woolcot, in a Grecian costume, wore
her two brilliant decorations and diamond
roses in her hair. Mrs. Sellheim had red
roses on her white and black brocade. H.
V. McKay was a large episode in the room.
Only two Federal members turned up—Wise
and Edmund Jowett. Jowett, the Farmers’
friend, wore exquisite pearls set in platinum
in his dazzling linen.
Admiral Grant wore all his honors. Some
of the soldiers who arrived with all their
decorations on were sent home to change
their tunics in order to comply with some
dress regulation which Birdwood carefully
explained. Carriages and motors were
brought round at 10.30, and there was the
usual scramble in the portico with the rain
drowning the roars of the taxi-caller.
Gala night at Her Majesty’s sparkled with
uniforms and glowed with brocades and
powdered shoulders. Birdwood was the
centre showpiece, and the sunburnt faces of
generals were everywhere. Billy Hughes had
a place of honor, and Senator Pearce rose
in a lengthy way from a box. Major Pain
(staff-officer to Birdy) was a bright spot in
the dim light. Piddington, of the Inter-
State Commission, was there for his little
bit of pantomime, and Hugh Ward, over
from Sydney, looked cherubic in a box.
Puce-colored matrons hurried about in
georgette poems when the sun blazed and the
briekfielder blew on the Government House
lawns and the Birdwood garden party. The
panting social heavyweights pounced upon
frail little wooden chairs and scuttled off
to any patch of shade. The poor guests were
scattered and unsociable until someone had
mercy on them and the front door was
opened. Then panting women stamped into
the coolth and flung themselves upon pink
ices and cucumber punch.
Cousin Carre Riddell, Chairman of the
Board of Works, was a proud man for
three days as he piloted Birdy around the
sources of the city’s water supply from Yan
Yean to O’Shannessy River. Ilis pride was
not in water and sewerage pipes alone, but
in his valorous staff, which had contributed
216 recruits during the war.
Federal Government House is to be im-
proved and furbished up a bit for the recep-
tion of Edward. It hasn’t, had much titivat-
ing since dad visited Melbourne in 1901.
The official naval reception cheered up
Hobart. Governor Newdegate made almost
his last appearance before departing for his
new job in Westralia. The Jones and Nieholls
dames, Mrs. Hore, and the bright little Tom
Murdoch lady were among the guests; also
Premier Lee and his lady, Mr. aud Mrs.
Webster, and the Kerr-Pearses. Of course
Dumaresq and all the officers appeared and
had a day out. It was the first official job
of the new mayor, Colonel Snowden, and his
wife. Sir Francis Newdegate leaves the Apple
Island this week. Major Kerr-Pearse goes
also to find a home in the West.
Hobart says that Commodore Dumaresq is
charming socially but a trifle too keen on
shot practice and such things. Instead of
allowing the boys to play round, he rushes
them off to Norfolk Bay for serious work.
But the Tasmanian season was wrecked in
any case by the marine engineers’ strike.
Hobart felt keenly the hold-up of visitors
from the mainland. On the arrival of the
grey ships the tyrant. Dumaresq announced
that no public bodies need call. Then, when
the prayed-for rain fell on Regatta Day and
Hobart wanted the revel postponed,
Dumaresq said, “Now or never!” So the
half-drowned show was held to schedule
time.
There was unholy joy among the naval
men when one of the destroyers, after
steeplechasing across Bass Strait, had to run
into the Tamar. A high naval officer was
aboard. He was so seasick that they had
to land him at Launceston and motor him
to Hobart. Launceston was not scheduled
as a port of call, so these destroyer men got
the welcome of their lives.
Port Arthur hitherto has been merely a
day trip for tourists from Hobart who wished
to gloom over convict relics. Now a man
has bought the old convict prison-hospital
after much argument with the Government,
and the Hotel Arthur is to-rise from the
ruins.
If precedents established on previous royal
visits are to be followed, it will devolve upon
the elegant Steward to nominate a detective
to be Edward’s shadow while in Vic. The
man to fill the bill must unite to alertness
and tact the manners of a Chesterfield and
the style of a secretary of legation, so that
he may be mistaken by the public for a
part of “the entourage.” Unless the exes,
iire libernl the job won’t be rushed, judging
by the meagre rewards which have come to
these shadows in the past.
Humphrey and Co. supply this view of
the wife of Admiral Creswell, who, after
suffering long from
unmitigated philan-
thropy, is now retir-
ing with her fine old
sailor into the peace
of South Wandin.
During the war she
mortgaged her
leisure to the Red
Cross, U nion of
Soldiers’ Wive s,
Navy , League and
other organisations,
yet she could always
embezzle a few
moments for the
Children’s Hospital
and Arts and Crafts
Society. She was
one of the parents of
the Arts and Crafts,
and the other day it was her pleasure to
receive a leather-mounted address tooled by
a couple of the society’s clever ladies. With
tlie address came a cheque for £5OO from
the host of friends who endorsed it with
good wishes for years of happiness in the
new hush home.
The John Madden widow, who went off
some months back with the intention of
spending two years in England, is now- cheer-
ing herself for having secured a return pas-
sage to Australia in March. And it is not
her fault that she did not get back earlier.
London isn’t like it used to be; yet the mail
steamers leave here crowded with moneyed
Australians who think they know all there
is to know about the high cost of living. Let
’em go! It will complete their education
and make better Australians of them.
Gaud Mayor Aikman has made an inno-
vation that relieves the severity of the coun-
cil room at the Town Hall. The hard cane
chairs have been cleared off the scene, and
big leather lounges substituted. StiP most
of us would rather have hard-chair finance.
A councillor too much at his ease gets that
damn-the-expense feeling.
Alan Brown has thrown up his job as pri-
vate sec. to Vic. Treasurer McPherson and
joined the State Water Commission’s staff.
Veteran K.C. Edward Mitchell evidently
wearied one day this week of welcoming ail
the new judges, for he passed the job on
to Weigall in the case of Judge Dethridge
whilst he attended to McArthur in the
Banco Court. There has been a remarkable
series of “elevations” within the last year.
Irvine. Schutt, Mann, Williams, Dethridge,
McArthur, Knox and Starke have all moved
lip. It requires considerable versatility on
the party of Melbourne’s heavyweight Iv.C.
to ring the changes in the welcomes.
The well-shorn pate of scholarly A rein-
bald Strong bristled in a stall seat at the
Tivoli the other evening. Which shows that
there is always hope for even the most acute
cases of undiluted literature.
The brand-new Senators have much more
to complain of than mere M.H.R.’s, because
their salaries don’t begin for months and
months yet; but they are already being
chased and ordered by their new constituents,
while cartloads of correspondence has to be
tackled without the help of a single O.S.
stamp.
General Bertie Lloyd and his wife have
set up house at Toorak.
The new French Consul wants a house and
home for his family very urgently. He
brought out heaps of wonderful furniture and
French art treasures, including a real live
maid! If any one deserves to find a house
it is a family stocked with its own real
maid.

try some mental
arithmetic on her
earnings. Before Miss
Brake went off to
London he r com-
positions filled her
money-box several
times over; but her
biggest • return in
Melbourne looks like tuppence compared
with her income now. The young musician
is married to one of Andy Fisher’s staff,
and she has a sister who shows a neat gift
in illustrating her songs.
Adelaide on the look-out: —
The latest batch of J.P.’s includes Mrs. Daisy
Bates, the plucky • little woman who is godmother to
the blacks, and who has spent years in this State
and Westralia living near their camps and caring for
them in sickness. At present she is at the native
camp on the East-west Railway.
A Royal Red Cross has come to Sister Hodge, one
of the two South Aus. sisters who were at Petwood
when the Weigalls ran it as a military hospital.
She was invested by G. Rex at Buckingham.
Polo is reviving, and Society motors to watch the
play every Shturday afternoon.
A late March day in early February resulted in
chaotic dressing at the Galway farewell garden party.
Clothes ranged from coats and skirts (mostly relics)
to nets and ninons. But there were a few bright
spots: Mrs. H. H. Dutton in soft net and lace and a
blue-plumed picture hat; Mrs. Roy Milne (just back
from England) in soft grey; Mrs. Ronald Angas in
white; Mrs. Roy Burston also in white; and Mrs.
J. W. Bakewell (here on a brief visit from England)
in a straight-cut coat built of black satin and white
Irish crochet lace. His Ex. received his 2000 guests
on the lawn near the main doors, and thereafter
spent a strenuous two hours saying his own good-
byes and booking messages innumerable for Lady
Galway. Before the garden party there was a
Ministerial farewell luncheon at Parliament House.
Surgeon-Capt. E. C. Black and his wife have re-
turned—he after five years’ service, partly on the
Western Front and partly in German and Portuguese
East Africa. Another home-comer is Florence Kelly,
who has also seen five years’ war-work.
The Burra, which has one of the best recruiting
records for the larger country towns, wiH also be
one of the first to have its own war memorial —a
42ft. marble column topped by a lifesize figure of
a soldier in bronze.
The Governor had a final 40 minutes aloft with
Capt. Butler. One of the last .offices his Ex.
accepted was that of patron of the S.A. Branch of
the League of Nations’ Union, and one of his last
gifts was a charter from the Returned Soldiers and
Sailors’ League making him a life member. He has
been the Digger’s good friend.
That useful body the Travellers’ Aid Society is
asking for funds, and if the public realises anything
of its work it will get them easily. Every boat
is met, and every long-distance train, and women and
girls with no friends are taken in charge and cared
for. The little Lodge in Leigh-street never turns
any stranger away, and in the past 12 months has
housed nearly 500 different girls and women.
Children travellimg alone are taken under the
Society’s motherly wing, too.
Back in Adelaide after nearly six years’ absence
Mrs. Ada M. Hogg, who with her late husband ran
Adelaide’s pioneer business, training college. Mrs.
Hogg was in E<?i is when the Ivaiser started his
world’s kultur college; she got to England promptly
and war-worked from then onward.
Dora Horwood, whose father was for so long
manager of the Big Mine at. Broken Hill, is engaged
to her cousin, a son of Peter Wood, the Adelaide
merchant. Broken Hill, notwithstanding its (large!v-
undeserved) reputation for Bolshevism, did realh
wonderful war-work, and Dora Horwood and her
mother were leaders in all the activities.
Apropos Broken Hill’s reputation for Bolshevism.
The Bulletin some time ago reported the surprise
of a municipal conference in Sydney when it dk.
covered that the Mayor of Broken Hill wasn’t even
a Laborite. Now there has been a municipal elec-
tion, and not a single Laborite was returned. The
pendulum has swung with a vengeance.
Another of these cosmopolitan affairs
The young Sydney solicitor who went away
with the sth (F.A.) Brigade as Gunner
Elliott has arrived here to marry the prettv
daughter of Robert Best, knight.
Scotchbyterian-Major Smith Mac-Bain
sometime shepherd of souls at Queenselil'v!
took his family to the Cold Country last
year. Now he is back again to wind up i
affairs and return to Britain for good.
Mamma-in-law is the widow Wrixon. wlni
has been living overseas since the late
Henry’s death, and doesn’t want to do any
more sea-travelling, though she feels the
need of a family-circle in her declining
years. The Wrixon family was a study in
dissimilarities. Henry, who had the lum
boring figure of a ploughman, loved to air
his knightly decorations in public. As vice-
clianccllor of the University he used to
attend entertainments there with what the
students called his “dinner-set” spread over
his chest —and generally went to sleep in
his seat before the show was over. His
dame was rather more sprightly, with a
quaint taste in liair-dressing. Daughter
made no effort to camouflage her own simple
soul, and quite naturally married into the
kirk. Father was seriously inclined, too:
he wrote a book entitled “The Religion of
the Common Man.”
Ruth Ferry, who has come to Australia
by the Indarra, is an English girl; but she
knows more Diggers tnan most of the in-
habitants of their native haunts. The
familv home in St. Stephen’s-road, Houns-
low, was open to the A.1.F.; and in the
years of war the A.I.F. went there in
thousands. Besides pa and ma and Ruth
there were Joan and Celia to aid in the
good work, and they made their corner of
Blighty home. Ruth is in for a good time
in these parts, where she will stay with her
uncle, Senator Maughan, at Toorak.
Frocks in New York are hooped a trifle,
but there are narrow filmy skirts underneath.
Dresses that are not hooped a’e pleated,
with a straight-line effect, and split for free
knee-action, idohuc of the underskin-
mere pantalettes with narrow irregular edges.
“Clothes are beautiful but outrageously dear”
is the report of visiting Australians.
Stella Power, now in England, has boolod
up several engagements already. One was
a week’s tour with the Coldstream Guards
in place of Clara Butt, disabled by illness.
Stella was advertised by sandwich men up
and down Piccadilly Circus and all over
the place for her first concert. Lionel
Power, manager for Melba, is also steering
Stella.
Francis de Bourgignon, the bright Belgian
pianist, who became well known in Australia
in 1918-10, both in solo work and as accom-
panist to Melba, has made a successful first
appearance in London at the Wigmore Hall.
The Westminster Gazette described him
as “a very clever young artist, who is able
to hold his own even in these crowded days.”
and various journals gave the glad hand to
his own compositions as well as to -others he
played. Before coming to Australia De
Bourgignon had toured in America. Having
a sense of humor, he was without the pon-
derous poses of many musicians, both on and
on the platform.
One of our numerous generals took a batch
of prisoners to Rotterdam. He says the most
pitiable creature on board at the outset was
Seharf, the pianist, who had been interned
in Victoria. Seharf wanted to play lest
his precious fingers should get stiff. The only
piano was in the officers’ mess-room, and
they gave him the use of it for an hour or
two each day. But, as some Philistine re-
marked, he would play those monotonous
classical things. The officers at last got
restive. “Can’t you keep your fingers in
practice with real music?” they implored.
Scharf’s efforts at popular rags were worse
than the classical exercises, and he was dis-
qualified. Then the musician begged to be
allowed to play soundlessly. He sat over
the piano and moved his fingers over the
notes without striking. Sometimes inadver-
tently a note would sound, and the musician
would look over his shoulder appealingly.
There was some hint of mutiny aboard, and
it was ascertained that the Germans were
being primed mysteriously with whisky. A
hunt was made and the secret discovered.
The practical scientists had rigged up a sti
made chiefly of an old soap drum, and got
the spirit from potato-peelings.
A dress- designer worked off a curious in-
spiration in Her Majesty’s panto. The prin-
cipal hoy wears a cloth-in-gohl tissue cloak
and its pattern is the bad old broad arrow
done in black with gold embossing.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
It was very breathless at Bodington, even
though the mountain valley on to which
the wide windows of each man’s room open
was doing its best in the matter of cool blue
haze and greeny leaf. Very breathless the
pink-and-white youngster was finding it, as,
propped up in bed, he listened to the
cheerful sound of hammering and planing
that came from the workshop lower down
in the grounds. “The boys are making a
theatre,” he explained, “with a real stage
and scenery. One of the chaps here, he
designed it— made a model of proscenium
and wings and all out of one piece of paper,
and painted in the color scheme; and the
boys dyed lengths of calico mauve and violet,
an’ it’s going to be a real swell place. Only
we haven’t got a piano; not one that the
Carusos will warble to. I hope we’ll have
one by the time I’m up—a sing-song’s a
great way of passing the time.” The blue.
p yes sndled good-bye. Sister closed the door.
‘ B our years’ active service, and only 19
now,” she said.
Down in the workshop all hands were
busy painting, measuring, staining. The
stalwart young chap with his foot-rule stuck
through the band of his carpenter’s apron
told us all about it—how somebody had
taken him all over the stage of Her Majesty’s
and given him the hang of the thing; and
“jow ? they lack only timber and a piano.
Heve got a euphonium, and a cornet and
a violin; but a piano would be fine! Of
course we can have the one from the nurses’
sitting-room, but”—he fingered the foot-rule
a bit— we aren’t strong enough to carry it
up ana down. Timber, too, has gone up till
its more than half as much again as it was
aS j and there’s still the seats to be
made.
1 herej the story, O Piano Princes, and
you. O Timber Kings ! Bodington Bed Cross
Convalescent Home, Blue Mountains, is the
address. Kemember the pink-and-white con-
sumptive youngster who was four years at
the war, and is only 19 now!
The war sisters who missed being decor-
ated by George at Buckingham, and had
the decorations merely handed them by the
postman or a Governor, or some other every-
day and thick-as-blackberrres person, are
feeling thrilled to the last knob of their
vertebrae o.v the whisper that the decora-
tions are to be sinilea upon by that nice little
Knghshman whom our boys liked to call
leddy Woodbine.
Something’s doing in official circles.
Bmough committees have been appointed to<
entertain a whole Royal family. Banding,
reception, entertainment, decoration, illumi-
nation and press committees are alreadv
T U .P’ with an “expert” at the head of
eacln Lieut.-General Brudenell White comes
to Sydney this week to help make up a
gorgeous programme.
This is “Bush Week,” when city folk learn
what they owe to the “turner of the soil.”
W indow displays, a pageant and an exhibi-
tion opened by his Excellency (who comes
inTr th f count Fi° d< ! the deed > are some of
the features of the show, which has Albert
Goldie behind it as stage-manager.
The social world is pouring down from
Bowral for the marriage of Cecily Catterall
d fi l<?l d ance. She has been one
ot the most popular girls in Sydney for
several years. Bowral was never fuller
has been during the past month.
All the big houses at Burradoo are occupied •
and there has been a round of dances mo-
nies and cricket matches.
There is a strenuous agitation in pro-
gress amongst those who already have titles
t?. keep * lush D - Mclntosh out of the
Ivniglits Tjnion. The worst is feared—nay
even anticipated—when the Prince arrives’
lhe young man is mad on boxing—and in
England Mclntosh’s name still stands for
Australian boxing—and he lias no sort of
objection to people who run music-halls
Mclntosh s chief pull lies in the facts that
a! i? F lcnds * n London who are friends of
r Tj inC if’ and hat he is intimate with
both Hughes and Holman. The rush for tlm
spoil is exceptionally fierce in N. S. Wales
and it is steadily growing in frenzy. Almost
everybody who has made money quickly has
hopes. Those who have already got there
entertain only fears. They complain that
their hard-bought distinctions are in dang"
of being degraded to the level of J.P.-ships.
“Billy” Curtis, the latest Acting-District
Court Judge, married the pretty Blau girl
some years ago. Like her he is enthusiafti-
cally musical; in fact, he ranks amongst
Australia’s foremost composers. A small,
bulldoggisk man with the energy of half a
dozen, he has plunged eagerly in his time
into almost every form of mental activity.
Politically he is a radical high protec-
tionist, and at the Bar he practises on the
common law side.
S. Australia evidently lost sight of John de
Linden Affleck, heir to the Affleck baronetcy,
after he and his wife left their Book-lovers’
Library and went to England; for on the
death of Sir Robert Affleck Adelaide
announced that its old friend had become
Sir John. But John died two years ago,
and the title now passes to Frederick Danby
James Affleck, of Palmswood, Queensland, a
cousin. The widow of John —she was
Blanche Robson, of Sydney—has returned
to her native city.
There was winter in the air for the first
of the races of the Ladies’ Championships
at the Domain Baths, and some shivering
mermaids took the water. The new cham-
pion, Coogee girl Mina Wylie, who lowered
the colors of Fanny Durack, bore her honors
blushingly, and the former champion looked
as if she was tired of the old thing, any-
how. Bananalander Elsie Venningr- was a
good third. A sister of Victorian champion
Frank Beaurepaire had a great ovation be-
fore she even took a dive; she deserved it
later for her win in the 100 yards first-class
handicap.
Between swims the inter-State visitors are
being pleasantly entertained. President
Mrs. Hugh D. provides a harbor trip and
a garden party as her share of the cele-
brations. Tea, music and speeches at The
Marlborough constituted the welcome ex-
tended by the officers of the N.S.W. Ladies’
Swimming Association. Some mere males
from the A.S.A. just prevented the gather-
ing from being frocks and millinery sur-
rounding aster-decked tables with nice things
to eat.
Judging by the reception given to Cacialli
at Saturday night’s pom at the Town Hall,
the silverv tenors are likely to be supplanted
in maiden affections by this basso of the
fine voice and charming manner. His con-
tributions included a trio of operatic excerpts
and Mattinata in ze Engleesh. Clad in
lemon draperies soprano Gladys Verona
tricked some of the audience as to who did
the echo of the Dinorali “Shadow Song.”
She also warbled the words, to Harold
Whittle’s rippling accompaniment of “By
the Waters of Minnetonka.” with Cyril
Monk’s obligato. Cyril, by the way, got in
more marine effects in “By the Sea.” Chopin
and some other composers received artistic
handling from Miss de Cairos Rego as
pianoforte interpreter.
You’ll be glad to meet Mrs. Brough again
after her wanderings; and Monte Luke
makes it possible. As
you know, she’s Mrs.
Bell now. After six
years in England she
has returned con-
vinced that Austra-
lia’s best. “England
for the springtime,
Sydney for Home”
—they are her sen-
timents. So com-
plete is her adop-
tion that she en-
thuses over "our
boys’ ” triumphs not
only in war, but also
in the sport of those
wonderful days in
England when Fel-
ton beat Barry, and
Hawker saved Bri-
tish prestige.
Arriving in England in May, 1914, when
as yet you couldn’t hear even the distant
thunder of the storm, Mr. and Mrs. Bell
first did a motor tour of the South of Eng-
land. Afterwards came her 18-months’ en-
gagement with Vedrenne and Dennis Eadie's
company in “The Man Who Staved at
Home.” That was at the old Royalty
Theatre. “Disraeii” also had its premiere
there. History repeated itself when she
played a season with Dion Boucicault and
Irene Vanbrugh in “The Land of Promise,”
“Trelawney of the Wells” and Barrie’s
“The Old Lady Shows Her Medals”; and
Mrs. Brough-Bell thought that a charming
war-sketch full of real pathos. Somerset
Maugham’s “Caesar’s Wife” introduced Mrs.
Brough to the cleverest leading juvenile in
London, Fay Compton, pretty and red-
haired, excellent in both comedy and emo-
tional work. She is of the famous Compton
Comedy Co., and owns novelist Compton
Mackenzie as brother. Mrs. Brough ap-
peared with Marie Lohr, too: that was in
“Home on Leave.” Of the London successes
of the past six years she thinks but few
would please Australian audiences. “Nurse
Benson,” a Marie Lohr success, might.
Of course there were some great re-
unions—with Miss Bessie Major, who was
still with Oscar Asche in “Chu Chin Chow” ;
with Beatrice Day. who war-worked in
France; with Tittel Brune; with Dorothy
Brunton and W. S. Percy (both of them
had bad luck in striking non-stayers, but
later got into successes). Julius Super-
bus Knight was domiciled in a quite
gorgeous flat in London ; he’s appearing now
in a musical version of Peg Woffington.
Prior to that he was the bright spot of a
failure, “The Net,” at the Seala.
Cyril Bell, husband of Mrs. Brougli-Bell,
had a unique war service that took in land
and sea and sky. A Sydney yachtsman, on
declaration of war—he was in Blighty at
the time—he offered his services to the
Admiralty, and was put on the .reserves.
While waiting to be drafted he enlisted for
the Expeditionary Force in France, in days
when the British had one machine-gun "to
the enemy’s 12. with the result that rifles
had to be used until they were too hot to
hold. The retreat at Mons was the begin-
ning and the second battle of Loos the end
of his infantry service. A call by the
Admiralty gave him charge of a mine-layer
in the North Sea, and that and subsequentlv
a sub. and the hunting flotilla filled three
years. Then eye-strain told, and he had
to retire to a shore job. Soon afterwards
came the Armistice; and he was sent with
hydroplane and sweeper to the minefields to
clear up the debris.
May Moore shows you these fine eyes
which belong to Sister Mabel Thurston, a
Maorilander, who, after great service in
France, Egypt and
London, received the
Royal Red Cross
and a n Emp i r e
Order from George
Rex at Buckingham-
Palace. In one way
the Maoriland
nurses confess they
had a more satisfac-
tory time than their
Aussie sisters.
Maoriland had a
general hospital in
Blighty, to which all
damaged Kiwis were
sent. Australia was
bluffed out of that,
and its boys were
scattered all ov e r
the country, thou-
sands of them being in the care of inexperi-
enced Y.A.D.’s. Sister Mabel, back home,
is now matron of Christchurch Hospital.
That good citizen Ruth Beale goes shortly
to America with a brother. Her part
is to study women’s work in the municipal
sphere. One dhy last week she put before a
meeting of women at the Town Hall a plan
for getting cheap fruit and vegetables from
the markets. Men of the Fruit Growers’
Association supported the lady, but the women
mostly dodged the issue. In a nutshell, her
plan is this. Householders should form
groups, with a buyer to go to the market and
purchase requirements, goods to be sent
to one home and called for. Simple and
practical. Meantime fruit and vegetables go
to the tip, and the cost of living climbs
another step up the ladder.
The curtain fell on the French-Australian
League of Help after J. D. Fitzgerald had
handed £6585, the balance of the France’s
Day Fund, to Consul-General Campana, and
had received in return a pretty compliment.
“There is,” said the French spokesman, “a
little village in the Ardennes which has asked
leave to call itself Sydney, and there will be
many villages- in France with Australian
names; but not as many as there will be
remembrances of the generosity of the Aus-
tralians and the bravery of the soldiers in the
broad hats.” All told, the French-Australian
League of Help gathered for France close
on £300,000. A case of pipes was a parting
souvenir to Mr. Rowe, who had been honor-
ary packer to this depot. Then came tributes
of thanks to the secretaries and officers, and
to the Government for endowments and
assistance; and Archbishop Wright hurried
in to the Benediction.
The Society of Women Painters spent a
whole afternoon fixing to members’ satisfac-
tion the 68 or so typed paragraphs which
represented the “Rules and Constitution” of
the newly-organised society. Most amicable
were the proceedings, though a storm-cloud
appeared when the Selection Committee was
mentioned. Mistakes of the past were pro-
vided against, and all members are to be
bound to sign the Rules and undertake to
abide by them. About the only sure office
appears to be that of the Trustees, who,
according to Rule, “must die, resign or be
removed” in order to lose their honorary
distinction. An intellectual, Bohemian
atmosphere is now exchanged for that of the
purely social of the club’s first year. And
the women painters run the show. Officers
now stand : President, Mrs. F. W. Parsons;
treasurer. Miss Laura Booth; sec., Miss
Will-Slade; with E. W. Perkins hon. soli-
citor and Mr. Sherwood one of the trustees.
Good-looking Maurice D’Oisley, the lyric
tenor who scored in Australia with the
Quinlan Opera Cb., has just married Rosina
Buckman, Maoriland> ? s high-class soprano.
Maurice and Rosina are both leading lights
in Beecham’s Opera Co. in England these
days.
Devonshire House is again being pushed
into the limelight—this time as a suitable
place for a Dominions Club. It is in the
most highly-rated part of Piccadilly. Its
frontage is equal to that of any other two
palaces in this street of palaces, and there
is over an acre of ground attached to it
The Duke of Devonshire, although technic-
ally a millionaire, has been trying to get
rid of it for years, the upkeep being more
than the family revenues can stand. Syd-
ney’s Union Club affords a useful example
of the folly of club-promoters overdoing it
as regards acreage. With its big. spreading
premises and pleasant garden it seemed a
reasonable enough proposition—half a cen-
tury ago. To-day—well, things are so hot
in the way of taxes, ground rents and su
on that the members are seriously thinking
of getting out and amalgamating with a
much humbler institution in Macquarie-
street.
.Tack Massie and his pretty Newcastle
wife arrived home on the Sonoma last week
He had a spell in Sydney in 1915, and then
went to England with a batch of 3rd Divvy
reinforcements. He has latterly been in
charge of the sports organisation at liorse-
ferry-road.
Memories of the “Fortieth Foot,” the
first regiment to visit these parts, arc
awakened by the visit of Captain J. Hislop.
of the South Lancashires, in which the, old
corps is now embodied. On six months'
furlough from India, the captain is en route
to see his homefollc in Maoriland : then he
expects to take up duty in Ireland. While
in Sydney he has been delving in the
archives of the Mitchell Library for data
about the Fortieth.
Mrs. Young, widow of Captain Young.
R.A.M.C., lost when the Clenart Castle was
torpedoed, is in Sydney. Born in the Vic-
torian bush, she was sent to England to
school, and has been away ever since. A
play writer of some note, she made a tidy
hit with her pen for war funds. When her
husband was stationed in S. America, one of
her plays, “A Victim otf Circumstances.”
netted £587 for the Red Cross and Prince
of Wales Funds. In spite of the war she
says there’s still crass ignorance in London
regarding Australia; and she wants to
study our conditions so as to be able to
deal out the truth when occasion calls for it.
Mrs. Young is accompanied by her cousin.
Blanche Goodwin, daughter of the late Ladv
Mary Goodwin, and a grand-daughter of
the Dowager Countess Sondes. She intends
remaining here for good. During the war
she was a worker at A.I.F. headquarters.
Mrs. Pope, once Leslie Grant Cooper, now
the wife of Lieut.-Commander Pope, is back
in Sydney with an infant daughter. She
witnessed the surrender of the German
Fleet; then she was quite ready to come
home. Her husband left in the Sydney and
returned in the same good ship.
Next month Roy Dimmick, of Melbourne,
who did his bit at the war, will marry the
girl he left behind him —Myrtle Monie,
daughter of SamJMonie, of Randwick. Bride-
elect is a Sydney V.A.D. Her future home
will be in Melbourne.
Mrs. Henry Hill Osborne —she was Mar-
jorie Lord and a Sydney belle —is down from
her Queensland home, Clifford, after a stren-
uous time with drought and the domestic-
help problem. From the Pacific she has gone
to Mount Cooper. Small son Rupert went
with her; also little Diana Cumberlege, who
gets her first introduction to the bush.
Returned from Erin last week, after 14
years, Father T. A. Fitzgerald, of the Order
of Friars Minor, best known as Franciscans.
During his absence Father Fitzgerald has
become well-known in the literary world,
and as a Gaelic scholar. Coming back
home he put in three months in Wilson's
Territory in midwinter, and is sure now
of one thing, that Australia is God’s country,
and not the land across the way. Inciden-
tally he treasures, and still wears, a clerical
coat made in Aussie 15 years ago!
The Sonoma brought back to Sydney Mrs.
George Bell, widow of the silver-tongued
Colonel who Consuled here for Uncle Sam
years ago. Mrs. Bell is out on a health
trip, having knocked up while nursing
doughboys.
Taylor Darbysliire (late of J.C.W., Ltd.!
and his family are settled at Bromley, in
Kent. The two daughters are at Kensing-
ton High School, and Mrs. Darbyshire has
already joined the musical world there. As
Kitty Rickards she was a few years ago
Brisbane’s most brilliant accompanist.
Novelist Mrs. Katherine Watson Dearden
called in here this week from Brisbane on
her way to Melbourne, where she remains
a fortnight. Her daughter’s education and
a new book are reasons for the visit.
Little Miss Dearden will be schooled at
Geelong.
R. K. Manning, whose little girl was
accidentally killed in Manly last week, be-
longf to the family whose best-known mem-
ber was William Manning, the Supreme
Court Judge. Clara Manning is one of his
cousins, and Mrs. Tregarthen is another.
Charlie Manning, who was a well-known
Equity barrister before the war, did good
work on Gallipoli, rose to major’s rank, and
was killed in France.

Every Guest Sincerely Enjoyed
the Evening
Those who sang were at their best.
The accompaniments—-played the
Beale-Player way-possessed a charm-
ing sympathetic feeling that formed a
perfect background to each guest’s
effort.
Those whose conception of music was far in
advance of their manual dexterity, experienced
the keenest pleasure in being able to sit down
to an instrument which supplied all they lacked.
In the first half hour everyone was acquainted
and the evening rippled to a swift end—enjoy-
ed by all.

as a pastime. It
describes in detail
the Drawing Course

WESTON, Austra-

It explains the
difference between
learning to COPY
and to DKA \V.
It points out the
pitfalls to be
avoided by the
beginner. It ex-
plains, in clear,
concisfe language
what the Weston
Course is, and why
Weston tuition is
the most success-
ful. .

Bushmen —“The Watch”
The “Super Fx. and R.” Watch has no equal for hard bush wear.
With 80 years of experience we KNOW this. What a Watch it is!
Every movement known to horological science is in it. It is
especially made for us for Australian hard-wear conditions.
Knowledge, effort, money unstinted, have been used to produce a
watch that a man can set at standard time, go with it into the
bush for six months, and return to find his watch on time.
All needed is that it be wound. Jewelled where the wear occurs.
We guarantee it for 15 years, and keep it in order free for 12
months, breakages excepted.
The price is not low, 63/-. in a steel case, but wh-’t reMlv first-
class tested mechanism is ? But the value is there, and more. The
watch will give PERFECT leults for 25 years.

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Copa: “Cashiered” is good enough to be
true; but the spare colonel on the staff says it
couldn’t have happened. .. .Scot: Yes; that has been
pointed out before. Can you suggest anything to make
the system better ?. .. . Alan B.: But you say no more
than the other man did.... Fifth Bat: Can’t place
the Inky Way par you refer to. Yours is a dull
screed, anyhow... .Jack: We have got a lot further
than that. But these are hand-looms, introduced .or
a special purpose to meet a special want.. . .The
Moralist: Not nearly.... M.T.M. (probably): Cer-
tainly we’ll publish them. Anyway, this much of
them:—•
It seemeth so to me
That the great salted sea
Is like a bird of prey,
Ever waiting the day
When, catching its victim,
Having ehok d and lick’d him,
Down into its foul, dark
Depths where lives the fierce shark.
Paula F.: A long way to go yet.... Emily B.:
“Beauty Seekers” misses.... E.W.W.: Not enough
• skill to carry the slight amount of thought....Recip.
Cyn.: “Trade and Commerce” not for us... .Seigillda:
Not enough there Aecton: Verse doesn’t get near.
.. ..H.F.W.: “Hog Sense” doesn’t make much of a
yarn... .Snarky: Dreary... .105: The donk yarn
deserves better telling... .F.A. (Waverley) : No use.
T.W.W.: “The Doubter” won't do. ...W.F.: “The
Ship Sails On” to very little purpose.... Nyx: Not
up A.W.S.: "Perfect World” doesn’t hit us hard
enough... .W.M.8.: Don’t care for either.... Harold
S.: N 0.... Sydney L.: Not much suggestion of Shaw
there... .E.F.0.: Very barren.... Titus Hye: Have a
look at some of it in print:—
From city, ships and Outback,
Composed the restless, waiting crowd;
Who mingled, with Digger and Anzac,
Their cheers, that mocked the showry shroud,
“When Birdwood came.”
.... Tortoise: A woman in a shop in Florence asked
you to come upstairs and you ran away into the
street. Well, well 1... .Reginald S.: Don’t hold tip
a good yarn while you drag in poor samples of
frayed humor. It’s one of the ways they have in
America; but we’re in a hurry.... Flicker: Wood-
chopping isn't absolutely inevitable if you take the
other work seriously and put brains into it.... Kay
Jay: You don’t contrive to make it interesting....
Mick: Tlie basket gets it... .T.E.H.: P00r.... Dorothy
W.: Some nice feeling. Pity to waste it. Have
another try.... Bell: The thought is generally
commonplace, and there are many clumsy lines....
M.E.F.: “Blacksmith” nearly. The “Babes” go to
pieces on lines like “Oh, a hundred hearts them
fathered”... .C.M.L.: The dawn-morn rhyme right
at the start 1... .E.R.P.: That yarn was decently
told in an American magazine. You’ve made a hasp
of it... .E.L.S.: A very commonplace wind that....
Bellerive: The dream has all the old tender magic:—
... .C.C.: Nothing fresh in treatment of a very
print-worn theme... .Ina: “Love of only he” is im-
possible. .. .P.D.P.: No use for “The Artist”....
Marjorie S.: If it had come along four years ago it
would have had a chance... .A.H.W. : “Triolet”
doesn’t strike us W.R.8.: Clumsy. You rhyme
“Gawd” and “roared,” which is proof of a pumpkin
ear... .Sarky: Doesn’t move u 5.... John A. G.: No
use....G.Y. (Melbourne): Hopeless that way. Try
it in honest, simple sentences.... Pearl: They flutter
feebly... .Marjorie B.: Verse moves heavily with an
occasional stagger... .L.G (Hobart): “Lil” hasn’t
enough interest... .J.A.P.: Goes along very nicely
till you strike the rhyme “Shah”-“are.” Why did you
do that?... .Hugh S.: Verse too much like the Parra-
matta-road... .Frank P.: Well enough done; but it
doesn’t do much more than create an unpleasant
taste... .D. 8.: Sorry, but time has killed the interest
in them... .Ignaw : Too much moving-picture absurdity
about O’Grady... .M.L.R.: No use... .Kemo: “Break-
away” doesn’t carry conviction with it... . Will C.
G.: The point is so small that the story would have
to be remarkably well told to carry it over that
distance...-Heave-o: Well, it wouldn’t be the first
mistake of the sort that’s been made in importing
a man. There is or was a Judge who got the job
through being mistaken for another man of the
the same name.... Jim B.: Aim at directness. You
wouldn’t talk like that if you were trying to per-
suade a mate to go fishing with you.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
K.W.C.: Uncle doesn’t seem to fit into the chair
too well. The open-air girls are better. A little
more animation... .T.A.8.: Yes, you made them both
with a hack-saw.... H.: It is no good, so it doesn’t
matter much whether it is a zebra or a porcupine.
F.D.: In art there is a very limited demand for
perfectly flat people... .E.D.: You didn’t get in early
enough with that gag....N.5.: The fat man who is
making the bright remark has come out with the
wrong hat....N.F.: Not this time, but keep going.
C.H.: All your people are too small, too ugly,
too flat. Sell the garden roller and draw people as
they are made... .II.B.: Bulges in the wrong places..
T. MeG.: You’ve been looking too hard at a Frank
Reynolds Punch drawing S.H.: Don’t want the
dreary old lady or the soldier Char: Give your-
self a few more years L.T.: Too crude and per-
sonal. .. .Iv.C.M.G.: Not good enough. Call .t
C.M.G F.W.N.: You’re only fumbling. Draw
smaller and save material.
’Twas midnight when I retired
To my couch of repose,
When in drowsy slumber
My eyelids did close;
Methought I reclined
In a weird-like dream
In the shade of a tree
Upon the banks of a stream,
When from the foot
Of the bending tree
A huge centipede
Crawled on to my knee;
I struck at the viper,
But the faster it clung;
When I uttered a groan
I was fiercely stung ;
With a rough-knotted stick
I did slash it atwain;
From it's saffron poison
I did writheth in pain.
The flush of the morning
Through the window did stream
When I awoke with a start
From the horrible dream.

Are you a Rexona Girl, too?
Rexona and Rexona Soap ensure that
clear, fresh skin and beautiful hair that
sjo so far to give any girl that natural
charm and beauty which is her rightful
heritage. If you are already a Rexona
Girl, tell your friends how good Rexona
is, so that they may be Rexona Girls,
too, or, if you have not yet used the
Rexona remedies, you should try them
at once, and it will not be long before
you, too, are a Rexona Girl. We have
received more than 5000 testimonials
from beautiful Rexona Girls in every
part of Australia, and they all praise
Rexona, not only as a rapid healer, but
say it keeps their skin in perfect con-
dition, free from all blemishes, and that
Rexona Soap should be used by every
woman who values her appearance.
Miss Nell Fallon, who was so popular
as principal girl in pantomimes and a
favorite with all theatre goers, writes
us as follows: —
Having used Rexona for some
considerable time, I feel that 1 must
congratulate you on the wonderful
results obtained through using same.
Theatrical make-up is apt to make
one’s skin very rough and unbecom-
ing, but I find that after washing my
face with warm water and Rexona
Soap the bad effects immediately dis-
appear and leave the skin fresh and
healthy.
Yours truly,
NELL FALLON.

GET THE REXONA HABIT.
A habit formed is hard to break. Had habits are easily formed; but good habits
can be attained almost as easily. The Rexona habit results in health and beauty,
and once formed will never be broken. , . , , , , ,
There are two Rexona habits—that of using Rexona Ointment to heal all injuries
to the skin, and the Rexona Soap habit, which consists of keeping oneself clean and
pure with a delicately-scented and medicated soap. Rexona Ointment and Rexona
Soap mean skin health and beauty, comfort to the user, and immunity from disease.
So form the Rexona habit.
Take a tablet of Rexona Soap and a triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid Healer,
home to-night. You will be delighted with them and wonder how you ever got along
without them.

Do not tolerate mere substitute reproduction

The difference between ordinary “talking machines” and the
NEW EDISON is greater than between ordinary violins and
the Strad. There is no exaggeration. Instead, it is impossible
to exaggerate the life-like powers of the NEW EDISON,
whose re-creations cannot be distinguished from the voice
or instrument of the living, breathing artist.
There is no scratching or “tinny” sounds—every overtone
and slight shade of music or sound being re-created with
marvellous clearness and beauty.

WE tramp and travel by moon and

To the gipsy tune of Fate,
But what's the use when the journey’s done
Of a kiss or a thought too late?
"I fellow the path of the sun." he laughed
As he shouldered his heavy pack,
A moment stayed, and a moment chatted,
And was gone on the nomad’s track.
‘‘But where will lie go?” said the wide-eyed
child
With her chin on the woman’s knee
"Oh. his eyes were sad and his look was wild,
But his hand felt kind to me.”
“‘Maybe to the south, to the north or west,
To the swing of a wanderer’s rhyme.
Who travels on in the hope of rest
Must tramp till the end of Time.”
“But, mother, the floods are high in the creek.
And the dead little lambs drift by.”
"Far, my child, is the shore he seeks,
And it’s little use to cry.”
"I wish that he’d come to the door again,”
Said the child, ‘‘in the day or night.
Ilis heart maybe is a place of pain
And a kiss might make it light.”
The wanderer went by the moon and star,
And he slept by the cedars dim ;
But never knew how afar, afar
Went the heart of the child with him.
We tramp and travel by moon and sun
To the gipsy tune of Fate;
But what’s the use when the journey’s done
Of a kiss or a thought too late?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ WT FAAj ’ rm Wowed!”
\\ Spiky Stott looked at the old
’ * man in the corner of the tram
who was staring open-mouthed at a strap-
hanger and glancing round for a sympathetic
soul with whom to share his discovery. A
plaintive, shabby old man, shabby even to
the point of a piece of string acting as one
shoe-lace; an old man not in the least like
the three ladies who had got in with him
at Darlinghurst corner and paid liis fare.
“Wot’s the matter, mister?” Spiky said,
being one of the sympathetic souls m the
tram. „ , .
“Ever since I come to Sydney a week ago
I’ve bin wondering wot them straps was for
—an’ now I know!” The other sympathetic
person chuckled before she could strangle
the impulse. The old man beamed at them
both, the red-haired larrikin boy and the
lon el v office-girl. Catching the aggressive
eye of the eldest of the three ladies, he
lowered his voice. ■
"We’re goin’ to the Show, he said por-
tentously. “I ’aven’t bin to Sydney this
last 20 years, wot with the girls’ schoohn
an’ clothes an’ one thing an’ another, but
we managed it this year at last.”
Spikv. the hawk-eyed Ishmael that is the
youth of the ’Loo, thought the three ladies
looked as if the cost of their clothes would
have kept any countryman out of a holiday
for more than 20 years. Miss Spencer con-
curred in the main. In some details she
knew better; but certainly in display of
turnout nothing much was left to be desired
or to the imagination or to anything else.
In her mind, too, the old man was too much
contrasted in his plaintive manner and shalv
biuess with the dominant, over-colored ladies.
“Now. Dad, you’ll have a pleasant time
lookin’ around Moore Park,” said the eldest
lady, “and you’ll meet us at the gate at ’alf-
pas't five, won’t you?”
“Why, ain’t I cornin’ in with yer?
“Course vou’re not, Dad; you know we
fixed all that to meet Mrs. Davis from the
Austral and ’er party an’ all. Don’t be so
silly. You meet us outside like we said;
you’ll be all right.”
The old man’s face cried to Heaven tor
vengeance. Spiky, hard as the ’Loo makes
’em from childhood to death, thought, it was
a shame. Miss Spencer, knowing not
much beyond Alberta Terrace and a type-
writer in Sussex-street, nearly wept. The
tram stopped under the Moreton Bay figs
and the people tumbled out, Miss Spencer,
the old man and Spiky in the same group
at the end. The over-colored ladies bustled
through the gate of the Showground with
the crowd, on whose skirts the three were
left standing. Spiky felt that something
should be done; he had come to see Clifford
Nimbles in the ground if he could, but this
forlorn old man turned out to play was too
much for him. And for Miss Spencer, ivho
waded in at once.
“Will you,” she said to Spiky, “take this
and pay for all three of us? .You needn’t
stay with us, but I can’t ask him.”
Spiky took two of the shillings, added his
own. and it was done, the old man protest-
ing feebly and ineffectually. Inside. Miss
Spencer told Spiky again that he could leave
them if he wished, but Spiky didn’t wisb-
not yet, at any rate; the old man was just
as much his business as the tart’s with the
brown, friendly eyes. Great beasts, not any
of them dumb, stared at the three drifting
round, the old man absorbing every grain
of dust in his Mecca of the 20 years and
trying to be polite to his hostess at the
same time. His face, no longer calling for
vengeance, was afl the politeness his hostess
thougfit she would ever want. Sniky, play-
ing the unusual part of third fiddle, pre-
sently became bored ; the long days of bond-
age in Pibble’s new shop were better than
this, he thought, even with old Miss Morti-
mer and Dr. O’Grady messing about with
the books. His boredom broke as he saw
from his seat in the teashop Clifford
Mimbles. the Bayard of his childhood's
dreams. Worn and tired, Cliff sauntered
past the window, beautifully dressed —one
of the heads, all right, and a man and
brother, too.
Cliff came sleepily down the room, only
Spiky marking the cold, watchful eyes paus-
ing for a second at each occupant of the
crowded room.
“Hullo, kid,” he said when he reached
their table.
“Why, Mr. Fraser,” said Miss Spencer, “I
thought you never left Melbourne?” She
held out her hand; Cliff’s eyes narrowed
and dropped as he took it and the chair
beside her. Fraser had been a lonely young
man. living very quietly in a St. Ivilda
boarding-house for the three weeks follow-
ing the hold-up of the Wagga bank messen-
ger. Miss Spencer and he had comforted
each other a bit. Spiky beamed at his hero
in silence; it was Cliff's business what his
name was. The old man punctuated his
never-ending monologue by startling gulps
of tea.
“Still as lonely as ever, Mr. Fraser?”
Miss Spencer smiled reminiscently at Cliff,
a distinguished young man whose speech and
manners hadn’t seemed to matter at Mrs.
Brownlow's, where he had really been a
great comfort to her. A fop, but with such
a telling personality that you didn't mind
that.
“No, not now,” Cliff said with an answer-
ing smile in his eyes, a rare thing that
Spiky sometimes saw and few others.
“You’ve come over for the Show?”
“Yes,” said Cliff, non-committally.
"It’s a great sight, mister, ain’t it?” the
old man contributed. "I ’aven’t ’ad such a
day since Gertie was born. The pumpkins,
an’ them pigs-j-I.ord you never stop learnin’.
do yer?”
Nobody replied; two hours of the mono-
logue had made that practically impossible
and quite unnecessary. For Cliff, tired and
ceaselessly anxious day'and night (when da.\
and night were his and not the law’s), the
girl spending a cheap holiday in Melbourne
had made a quiet patch in the picture two
years ago. She embodied for him his best
"get away” to date, too; the Wagga hold-up
was still a mystery. lie had been alone,
and the luck had held like God’s own, even
to a train running late at Alburv. But that
was not all. The cool verandah in St. Kilda
was still often visible when ’Tilda was
screaming at home in the ’Loo, and Clift
heard again the quiet, kindly voice of the girl
sitting white and shadowy in the half-light.
It was a good place in his memory, a good
restful place in a picture without much
rest
"Oh!” Miss Spencer’s hrown eyes looked
out of her white face in horror at Cliff. She
had been busy with her handkerchief and
a couple of small parcels for a moment.
“What is it?” said Cliff.
“My purse has gone,” she said, trying to
laugh, “and a whole month’s pay in it! Oh,
my goodness, what shall I do? Where did I
buy anything last?” to Spiky and the old
man. “Was it at the lolly-stall, or that
beef-extract woman?. No, I’ve searched
everywhere.”
Spiky was looking frantically under chairs
and plates and searching his own pockets in
desperation. The old man sat in helpless
despair.
“I couldn’t have dropped it; there was a
new strap put on only last week. Oh, gra-
cious me! And all that money!” It was a
hard job not to give way. Looking at Cliff
hopelessly for inspiration, she saw his face
grow hard and purposeful for an instant as
he turned to Spiky.
“Got any money, Spike?”
“Yes. Why?”
“Sit ’ere and eat while I go to the Lost
Property. I shaift be long. Don’t worry,
Miss Spencer; I’ll do my best. You never
know the luck, you know.”
“Thank you, Mr. Fraser; I don’t suppose
there’s much chance” Cliff got away
from her anxious eyes as soon as he could.
As he paused outside the door a little, fat
sport grinned as he went by.
“Here, Shorty !”
“Yes, Cliff.” Shorty was clearly anxious
to please.
"A tart in the tea-room’s lost her money-
box. Go past the window an’ take a look at
’er—big brown eyes, good-looker, sittin’ with
an old cocky an’ a red-’eaded kid. See if
anyone’s got it, will yer, an’ let me know.”
“Righto.”
For 20 minutes Cliff, bored and magnifi-
cent, promenaded with Fashion. Presently
Shorty stopped for a moment beside him.
“No go! But see the Beak; ’e’s in Lani-
gan’s bar.”
At the far end of the bar Cliff saw the
white face and Roman nose of the Beak ; he
made room for Cliff and motioned to the
bar-tender. Cliff took dry ginger; he was at
work.
“Any good?”
“Fifty-fifty,” the Keak said; “you doin’
anythin’?”
“Yes, lookin’ for a money-box.”
The Beak laughed. “So say all of us,”
he said confortably.
Out of Cliff’s eyes the personality Miss
Spencer had likecl shone, cruel and bitter
hard, on the Beak.
“Tart with an old man an’ young Spike.
Know anythin’ about it, Beak?”
The Beak’s white face looked wet and
helpless with Cliff’s purpose tearing at his
brain.
“Mum. Cliff?” Cliff nodded. “ ’Tilda’s
got it. Over at Alf’s.”
* * * #
Sergeant Melnstry, plainclothes, saw the
small crowd and ’Tilda “going on” in the
centre. ’Tilda with a halo on again, he
thought, as- he walked across.
“No, I’m if I will!” It wasn’t a
very bright halo yet, but it was there. “You
an’ yer fancy pieces an’ their purses. Why
should I?”
“Listen, ’Tilda. You know you promised
not to touch the snatehin’ or anything on
yer own when you’d ’ad one. Pass it up and
I’ll cover it all right. You an’ me don’t
want to be scrappin’ ”
“Oh, don’t we? An’ ’er all eyes, an’
lookin’ after dear little Spiky? Go an’ tell
her yer couldn’t find it, yer bastard!”
Melnstry took his cue. “What’s up. Cliff?”
he said.
“ ’E’s bin pinchin’ a pore girl’s purse, that
beauty ’as. Look at ’im; ’e can’t deny it.”
Melnstry was doubtful. “That’s small
potatoes for you. Cliff —bag-snatehin’. ’Ave
you come down in the world?”
Cliff’s harsh mouth grinned mirthlessly.
“It isn’t true, Mac; you know better than
that. I was lookin’ for a purse a friend
lost, an’ ’Tilda ’ere found it.”
Melnstry had to laugh. Cliff looking for
a friend’s purse that ’Tilda had found —
could you beat that?
With a flash of inspiration ’Tilda came
at them again. “Yer pinched it! Tike it

DO YOU FEEL LIKE GIVING UP?
Does your back ache constantly? Do you feel dull,
miserable and tired all the time? Do you wonder why ordinary
daily duties wear you out? Do you have “blue” days and
restless nights?
Kidney Sickness silently plays out the strongest person.
A dull, draggy ache in the small of the back will tell on the
healthiest man or woman. And if the kidneys fail in their task
of filtering uric-acid poisons from the blood, it leads to painful
attacks of neuralgia, rheumatism, sciatica, gravel, headaches —
to worrying attacks of dizziness, nervousness, heart palpitation,
scanty, painful and too frequent urination.
Don’t neglect weak kidneys. There is danger of running
gradually into dropsy or incurable kidney disease. At the first
sign of backache or disorders of the urine, use Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. A remedy that has cured your neighbor will
cure you.

Mrs. H. Sturgeon, 70 Marlborough Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, says:
“It gives me great pleasure to say a few words in praise of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. For a good while I was a martyr to kidney trouble, the
symptoms being backache, urinary disorder, and dizzy attacks. My back
ached fearfully and every movement was accompanied with a twinge like the
.stab of a knife. The secretions were cloudy and scalded a good deal in
passing, this symptom clearly showing my kidneys were very much out of
order. I heard good reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so decided to
give them a trial. The first bottle gave me relief and by the time I had used
three bottles I was cured, and I have been well ever since—a period of over
twelve months.”
Mrs. Sturgeon confirms the above four years later: “My cure still holds
good, no sign of kidney disorder having returned since I took Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills five years ago.”
Mr. Robert Larcombe, monumental mason, Lideombe, Sydney, says:
“Off and on for years I suffered from backache and kidney trouble. I would
go to bed feeling fairly well, but on rising in the morning my back would
ache terribly. The pains were sharp and shooting, and centred just above
the kidneys. I was advised to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills and I
sent for some at once. After using the first couple of bottles I felt better,
and five bottles completely cured me.
I can recommend Doan's Backache Kidney Pills to all who suffer with
their kidneys, and feel sure they will derive benefit from them.’’
Seven years later, Mr. Larcombe says: “It is over seven years since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me of kidney trouble, and I have had
no return of the complaint all that time.”

with yer,” ho said.
Mclnstry was still doubtful. “What ‘ave
you been up to?” he said, looking from the
angry face to the wary, expressionless one.
v'liff felt a touch on his arm.
"W hat is it V" said Miss Spencer. “You
were so long that I left t.lie boy there and
came to find you. What is it? I can’t
understand any of what they're all saying.
Have you found my purse for me?”
Officialdom clothed Mclnstry. “Are yon
the owner of the lost purse/ madam?” lie
asked briskly.
"I lost my purse, yes,”-said Miss Speucer,
“and Ml. Fraser Went to look for it.”
“Mr. Fraser be damned!” said 'Tilda
venomously. “That’s Clifford Mimbles, the
slickest crook in Noo South Wales. ’E's
done 10 years all told if . ’e’s done a day.
Mr. Fraser 1 You pore little sehooliuarm!
'lD’s me ’usband an' a thief an’ a gaol-
bird,” said 'Tilda, rising to the halo, “an’
there’s yer purse I picked up.”
“Here, that's enough id' that,” said Mcln-
stry, “move along there. You’re satisfied that
that’s your purse and that you lost it,
madam? I must warn you that both
Mimbles and his wife are bad characters, if
you wish to prosecute.”
“No -thank you,” .Miss Spencer said.
’Tilda’s work being done and, as she told
h rself, well done, she moved along with
the little knot of people. Miss Spencer looked
down at the purse turning over and over in
her hands. When Cliff couldn’t stand it
another second, she spoke.
; “Thank you for the quiet little parties and
sprees in Melbourne ; I have always remem-
bered them. You taught me a lot while
you were being kind to me that time —a lot
of patience and pluck, too.” She kept her
eyes still on the fumbling purse. “So for
that time and wlmt it meant to me then,
thank you again. I shall always remember it.”
She looked up at last, and Cliff saw that
ther eyes looked bigger than ever. She held
out her hand in silence, and smiled. He
took it without speaking, and watched her
walking towards the tea-shop. She went in
and disappeared.
“Could we look ’em over a bit. Cliff? I
came out 'ere to see if I could fiud yer;
'oaly said last night you was ’ome.” Spiky
blushed to his hair; asking favors was right
put of his line, “If yer’ve got the time, that
is. ’Ere, where are ,ver goin’, Cliff?”
“Home,” Cliff said, insensate rage em-
bodied.
Spiky looked at. the tall figure striding
through the gates. There went Ills day at the
Show, and his job at nibble’s he was going
to tell him about and everything. Funny!
That tart must be at the bottom of it, some-
how. “That’s what it is,” growled Spiky,
turning back into the empty Show —“skirt,
bloomin’ skirt!”
FRANCEI BRIEN.
Going to the Huts.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
u I DON’T know,” grumbled Hyams, the
I trader, mopping his fat, red face with
a gaudy bandana haudkercl^ef —“I
don’t know what the devil you youngsters
think you're talking about. You fellows are
calling a man ‘poor chap’ just because he
went to the huts. My boys, life in the
islands isn’t the conventional humdrum of
your cities. But you’re too damned young,
both of you.”
“Young—hell!” snapped Braseby. who
was choleric at the best of times, and all
the more peevish on this occasion as the
result of too much sun, sleep and whisk}.
“Anyone would think you were a blinkin’
rajah the way you go rushin’ along your
rotten criticism!”
Ilyams, Braseby and myself were island
men. Ilyams had been trading at Papeete,
Moorea and It aia tea for about .’>s years, while
Braseby and myself had sunk our little pile
in a plantation at Faaa, which would per-
haps pay the interest on the bill some 50
years after we were dead. We landed on
Tahiti Island not knowing a soul, and with
the stigma of having bought a German plan-
tation hanging over us. ilyams, who was at
that time 00 and a bachelor, had befriended
us.
On this occasion we were travelling from
Moorea back to Papeete, after a week-end
on the coast where the Iversaint lies bleach-
ing on the reef. It was a hot day—hot even
for Tahiti —and we were not feeling too
merry. As whisky after whisky led to dis-
cussion, we finally got to talking about a
chap who had come out to the Societies to
write poetry and other junk. He wrote two
poems, and then went to live with a little
brown lady from Papeete. That was over
a year ago, and he was a real “gone-blacker.”
It’s all right, you see, as long as you don’t
go mixing with the whole brown family.
You can have your little brown girl, but if
you have any sense —well, you’ll stop at
that.
“Braseby,” said Hyams suddenly, “I’m
going to show both of you boys how much
you don’t know. I’ve lived in this group
a long time, and I’m no chicken. I'm going
to (ell you something that will convince you
that there are worse things in this life than
going to the huts. I was in Papeete when
old John Hart brought his clipper inside
the reef for the last time in his life, lie had
pirated the Pacific, for the final bit of booty
and he died without any fuss. Mrs. Hart
went to Auckland, and she’s there still.
Now, among the crew of that clipper was
a. young Englishman. I don’t know what
he was, but he seemed to be a fairly flash
’tin—a blind man could see that. And Lord
knows where John Hart got him from!
After the old skipper passed out, this young
fellow just mooched round Papeete, boozing
and having a hell of a good time —and I
didn’t blame him. Braseby did the same,
didn’t you, sonny?”
Braseby grinned sheepishly.
“Well/Tahiti in ISSI was not a fit place
for a Methodist mission. The market-place
ran with liquor, and the morals of the town
were just about as bad as they could be.
A couple of degenerates from Toulon were
supposed to keep things- fairly decent, but
a lot of use they were! So my young fellow
kept on having a good time and spending his
money like a tourist.
‘“I don’t know whether you fellows have
been to Lavina’s. The old lady died during
the ’flu last year-. But, anyway, in the
’eighties the old girl was running her pub at
■a big profit, and no questions asked. It was
the best hotel bn the island in tnose days—
d la carte dinners and so on ; and the trad-
ing crowd used to meet there of a night,
drinking their whisky and grenadine.
“Orn nieht. when Emile Duparrez had
his old roulette-wheel on the go in the supper-
room, young English eocky-me-lad walks up
and says:
“ ‘See here, Duparrez. I’ve been losing
steadilv for weeks. I’ve been watching your
game to-night, and I think you’re a damned
cheat and scoundrel.’
“Duparrez was a little squirt of a man and
a crook, but he answered like a shot; “Get
out! And come back when you’re sober!’
“The Englishman turned “quickly to the
rest of us in the room: ‘Gentlemen, I have
but one way to deal with thieves and black-
guards, and here it is !’
“He strode over to the Frenchman, and
before we knew what was going to happen
had struck him in the face, leaving a livid
mark. Smiling a bit Duparrez bowed, and
feeling in his pocket handed the Englishman
a card, which the latter accepted. ‘To-
morrow?’ asked Duparrez. ‘To-morrow!’
said the Englishman.
“This, boys, you will have to take my
word for. When Duparrez left Lavina’s that
night he rushed over to Point Venus, to a
little shack below the beacon. He stood at
the door for an instant.
“ ‘Raita !’ he called. Immediately a well-
built native girl with a pretty face and a
sinuous form came to the opening. She was
as comely as the rest of ’em ; but, lads, she
wore a white cotton sheath on the first
finger of her right hand.
“ ‘Raita,’ said Duparrez, ‘how is the
finger?’
“The girl’s face clouded. ‘Bad, dear one.
But you will not tell!’
“ ‘No, I will not tell,’ said Duparrez
shortly. ‘Raita, somehow I feel 1 shall be
leaving the islands to-morrow night. I am
going to—well, I am hoping for the best.
Before Igo I want a promise from you. You
understand where you would be if it was not
for me, do you not?’
“The girl shuddered. ‘Ah, dear one, I
realise. I cannot thank you enough.’
“ ‘Good,’ said Duparrez. ‘We understand
each other. You know the Englishman from
Hart’s shin? The tall one?’
“The girl nodded.
“ ‘Raita,’ siiid Duparrez ; ‘if I go I want
you to live with him. Go to him. Say you
want to be his housekeeper—make love to
him; fascinate him with your dances. He
is to be your own.’
“The girl bowed her head in assent.
“ “Kiss me, Raita,’ said Duparrez, ‘for 1
shall never see you again. I feel that you
will keep your word.’ ”
* * * *
“There’s not much to tell about the duel.
It was a very ordinary affair. We all met
behind tlie old Barracks, aim Duparrez, cool
as a cucumber, won the toss. He drew the
blank pistol. The Englishman fired, and
every spectator gasped as Duparrez stag-
gered and fell.
“Two weeks later Raita and the English-
man were living together at Olua. You see,
things happen quickly in these islands. And
that’s the end of that little affair.”
"ii’mph,” grunted Braseby. “And can
you kindly tell me where, particularly, the
worse-than-the-liuts part comes in? That
was a deadly kind of yarn, Hyams!”
The old trader carefully lit a cigar, and
ostentatiously blew out the match.
“Dear lads,” he said, “you should learn,
amongst other things, not to'be impatient.
Unfortunately, about two weeks after Raita
had ensnared the Englishman, Doctor
Gauthier, who was a friend of the lad’s,
drooped in for a drink one afternoon. Sud-
denly he saw Raita’s hand. That’s the end
of it.
“The Englishman and Raita are at
Malietoa Leper Station to this day—l think
they have a grown son. I send them news-
papers occasionally.”
We both gasped.
“Duparrez was a hard citizen, wus he
not?” said Hyams.
F.E. BAUME.
A Fool’s Dreams.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A MAN works but his soul dreams
Of a green wave curling tall,
A white beach where a gull screams
And the high cliff’s shadows fall;
Where the sea rides to the sky’s rim,
And the world is blue and gold—
But work’s real and life’s grim,
So he grows old.
A man sighs for a hill’s crest
With a tall dark pine and grass,
A soft couch on the earth’s breast,
Where the young winds play and pass,
With the great sweep of the far range
And a vast cloud in the sky—
As days go and years change
The longings die.
A man waits for a fair face
And the lips of his desire,
A wild love in a calm place
By the red glow of a fire.
The maids trip by on their small feet,
And are good to look upon ;
His heart seeks for his dream sweet....
And youth has gone!
VICTORIA.
