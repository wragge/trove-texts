Here is iron ore from Australia being unloaded at the
doorstep of one of the great mills in Japan which make the
steel that goes into Japanese machinery . . .
Before very long this and other mills will take iron ore
(and coal) from Australia at the rate of 100,000 tons a day...
in turn Australia will be importing more Japanese machinery,
which already she is finding ideal for the advancement of her
own industries.
This is one illustration of Australia and Japan as the
interdependent, reciprocal countries they have become.
Their growing need for each other is the assurance of a wonderful
future for both.
It is in the hope of further promoting
mutual understanding between two
countries which are so important to each
other that Prime Minister Sato has
come to Australia this week.

No more bed
and board for
our Cliveden set
IT IS GRIEVOUS news that the two
Clivedens have succumbed, all within
the space of six months. The first
Cliveden, in Buckinghamshire, was the
country estate of the Astors. Last year
when the second Viscount Astor passed
on it was presented to the nation. Then
just last May there was a grand fire
sale of all household effects which, in
our money, fetched $400,390. Yes.
Cliveden was awfully famous. Both
Queen Victoria and Christine Keeler
are reputed to have slept there.
Now much worse news has arrived.
Our own Cliveden, that huge pile in
Wellington Parade, is up for sale. The
directors announced that it has been
losing money since July 1. You will
detect a note of jealousy. We have
always felt that our Cliveden Mansions
in East Melbourne rather had an edge
on the Cliveden in Buckinghamshire.
You see, the landed gentry, the nice
people who were pushing toward their
first million, always reserved a town
apartment at Cliveden Mansions. In-
deed the advertising brochure of 1920
stated: “Although but a few minutes by
car, or by the recently inaugurated mod-
ern fast electric tram service which
passes its doors, from the heart of the
city, Cliveden is flanked and fronted by
an EDEN of enchanting beauty.”
Unlike Lord Astor’s Cliveden, our
Cliveden has no Roman sarcophagi,
no Villa Borghese balustrade, no gazebo,
no rustic theatre, and ... ah ... no
swimming-pool where models can meet
Ministers for War in the Bolte Govern-
ment, but, sir, it has everything else.
Sir William Clarke, the first Australian-
born baronet, grandfather of the present
millionaire Sir Rupert Clarke, built
it in 1887 for £91,117. Think that over.
Then the working wage was about £2
a week. In our thinking, Sir William’s
charming town house cost more than
half a million. Town house is the opera-
tive word, for he had already built
Rupertswood at Sunbury for £50,000.
Actually, Sir William built Cliveden
to be a dead ring of the Bucks Clive-
den. It had a ballroom 100 xsoft., a
huge billiard-room, dining-rooms, re-
ception-rooms, 28 bedrooms, and, what
was sensational in 1887—five bathrooms.
Then there were 17 rooms for the ser-
vants. Not many? Well, you must un-
derstand these were only for the indoor
servants groomsmen, gardeners, and
such slept over the stables.
All the oak panelling came from
London, the acres of stained glass from
Italy, and, of course, a team of Italian
workmen was imported specially to do
the wood carving.
Where did Sir William get the
money? His father, the Hon. William
Turner Clarke, was one of Australia’s
pioneers. He had properties in New
South Wales, South Australia, Tas-
mania, Queensland, and his 31,000 acres
at Sunbury ran from Williamstown to
the Macedon Ranges. He was the wool
king of the world, but he had a terror
of spending money. He only liked mak-
ing it. When he died in 1874 he owned
more land than anyone else in Aus-
tralia and he left his son more than
£l4 million.
William Jun. immediately set about
getting rid of the cobwebs on all that
money. He gave thousands to charity
in cheques up to £lO,OOO at a time.
The story goes that in a train ride with
some American guests from Melbourne
to Sunbury—23 miles—he lost £5OOO
at cards. This cured him of playing
cards.
The Bulletin in 1883 described him
as not as clever as his father, but more
liberal. “He bought a baronetcy by
sundry timely and public liberalities. He
is a good fellow enough and perfectly
harmless.”
He bought a string of racehorses. He
bought a great yacht, but perhaps most
charming of all, he set up his own
regiment, the Rupertswood Battery. He
bought three Nordenfeldt field pieces,
he imported a famous British soldier as
drill instructor, Sergeant-Major Daley,
and his son, Rupert, became command-
ing officer. Always there were two
soldiers on guard duty outside the main
entrance to Cliveden and they were
marvellous for a guard-of-honor at a
party. That ballroom used to hold more
than 1000 people, every one of whom
would always rate a mention in “Table
Talk.”
The regiment, with drill three nights
a week, cost Sir William nigh on
£2OOO a year. Ah, but this was his
Mary, wife to Sir William Clarke. ..
one of the first of our big spenders
pride, and he sent the whole regiment
home to England in 1893 to compete
in military competitions. It was
rather like a cricket tour. But the
battery in fine uniforms, white spiked
helmets and all, did well. Joe McKeon,
Sunbury’s blacksmith, proved to be a
crack artillery driver and he won a
special gold medal from Lord Wol-
seley, Commander-in-Chief of the
British Army.
Sir William liked his visits to the
old country. The Bulletin in July, 1886,
reported that he paid £lOO for a royal
box at the colonial show, “a darned
good sum.” And we stated that it was
a wonder Clarke Senior didn’t arise
in wrath and expostulate with son
William for “slinging away a cool
century for the sight of a stout old
regal lady of 67.”
In 1897 Sir William stepped off a
cable tram in Collins Street. He col-
lapsed to the pavement and died of
a heart attack. The “Herald” brought
out a special “extraordinary” edition
and Sir William had one of the biggest
funerals ever seen in Melbourne. As
it set off from Cliveden more than 2000
people marched behind the hearse.
Cliveden was meant to be the home
for a long line of baronets, but it lasted
only one generation. In 1909 it went
to the Baillieu family for a mere
£22,000.
There was a public auction of all
the furniture and Melbourne “Punch”
was particularly rude. It pointed out
that such a halo hung over every-
thing to do with Cliveden that the
auctioneers had brought in furniture
from all over. It provided such an
oppoi’tunity for housewives in Colling-
wood and Fitzroy. Instead of having
something that was merely second-
hand, they could say: “Yes, a nice settee,
isn’t it? It used to be in poor, dear
Janet’s, Lady Clarke’s, morning-room.”
After 1910 an extra storey was added
and it became Australia’s finest board
house 57 apartments all with sitting-
room, bedroom, bathroom, and tele-
phone, for heaven’s sake.
After World War II one felt it
didn’t have the nobility of clientele
that it had in the ’2os. Yet on a recent
visit your correspondent noted that it
still had an aura about it. The beauti-
ful English oak panelling was still there,
so was the superb oak staircase, the
chandeliers, the marble fireplaces, and
the Italian stained glass. The dining-
room had space for three fireplaces.
The only place to beat this begging
Cliveden’s pardon -- is the bar in the
Mildura Workingman’s Club, which
has five. One huge stained-glass window
depicts a gorgeous plump Italian
Renaissance lady inviting all to enter
plus the words “NONE COME TOO
EARLY NONE TOO LATE RE-
TURN.”
But there were signs of decline. In
the bowls there were plastic flowers
and on the roof a huge electric sign
which advertised Stock 84 Whisky.
Sir William, Lord Astor, no, not even
Christine Keeler, would have stood
for either.

When a reptile's
under the weather
he's quite snaky
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THREE DAYS’ travelling 1500 miles
to and around Bourke on the Darling
River and what does John Cann come
back with? Two black ’uns. A friend
nipped up to the Murray River, stayed
five hours, and returned with 28! Well,
that’s the snake business for you. One
day they’re there, the next they’re not.
You can’t tell with the little devils,
even if this is the height of the Aus-
tralian snake-catching season.
Fifty-two weekends of the year,
weather permitting, John Cann and
his brother George turn out with their
snakes by the Bite-Well Bait cafe at
La Perouse in an attempt to teach the
public a bit more about Reptiles
They’re Likely to Meet and How To
Cope With Them. They both reckon
it is disgusting the way Australians
know so little about their snakes,
especially people who live in the coun-
try. Dad Cann started it all in 1918
and when he died they said it’s now
or never, either we carry on or the
whole thing finishes.
Now, George’s wife supposes she’s
used to snakes after 17 years of mar-
riage, not that she could touch one
unless she had to like the time her
little girl wrapped a snake around her,
and Mrs. Cann thought it looked a bit
tight but she doesn’t mind picking
up lizards. George, who does night
construction work, John does days, has
great respect for snakes. If one is too
strong and he can’t catch it he throws
it back. Why not kill it? ask friends.
Oh, no, says George, if he’s that good
he deserves to live. Anyway, if it
weren’t for snakes this country would
be overrun with rats and mice.
What makes them laugh is the way
house visitors say they hope there
aren’t any loose snakes about, and look
nervously at cushions and rugs for a
give-away wriggle. In fact, the snakes
about 60, mostly Cann-trapped, but
some bought at the going rate of $1
for common ones to $lO for rare ones
are hot-housed at the bottom of
John’s garden in a constant 80deg.
temperature, which item costs $3 a
week electricity. Then there’s the cost
of breeding rats and mice, which
snakes adore, the snap-freezing for
instant freshness (snakes are per-
nickety), and the storing in a refrigera-

tor. They also enjoy eels, frogs, fish,
and birds, in that order. Every 3ft.
of snake requires roughly two of what
is on the menu.
John Cann says really it’s much less
trouble keeping a dog or cat. Snakes
are delicate creatures, prone to coughs
and colds, and you can tell one’s under
the weather because his nose runs.
They bruise and sore easily and they
don’t like being held by their tails very
much. Well, it’s like us standing on
our heads, the blood rushes up. They’ve
got moods like humans, too. They can
be cross and grumpy and they can be,
well, if not exactly warm and friendly,
reasonably accommodating. A lot
depends on the weather. When it is
cold a snake is sluggish, when it’s
warm, just watch it. You don’t take
liberties then.
What the Cann brothers drive home
is, snakes don’t attack unless they are
attacked. A screaming woman, for
instance, will seem like all hell let
loose to a snake (they are deaf, but
pick up vibrations through their fangs).
What she should do is shut her mouth
and turn into a statue. A sudden jump
back could be fatal; there may be
another snake behind. Ideally, anyone
planning a trip where snakes are
expected should carry anti-venene. “If
bitten, however,” says George, as if
announcing the next train to Newcastle,
“tourniquet above the knee and above
the elbow.” And go like the clappers
to a hospital.
The Canns are not fond of their
snakes but they are, as it were,
attached. “Let’s put it like this: If
someone offered $4OO for them we’d
say no, if they said $5OO we’d think
about it,” says John. “Oh, John,” says
Mrs. George Cann, “I know two you’d
never part with, they’re priceless.”
Well, all right. They’d stay. It’s all
very hush, though, and the Canns lower
their voices. You see, there are some
snakies who would like to get their
hands on these two priceless specimens,
they’d stoop to anything to get them.
“I’ll tell you what, though,” says John,
perking up, “there is one I’m beginning
to dislike. I call him Hateful. He’s
started a nasty habit lately of lying near
the roof heating and going for my ear
when I’m not looking. It comes as a
bit of a shock because I forget to be
careful with the non-venomous ones.
Now then, did you say you wanted
to see the collection? I don’t let many
have a look. I’m a bit particular . . .”
Down in the hot-house the snakes
lie in knots and coils round branches,
under stones, in hollow logs, behind
cubicles with glass doors. John Cann
starts inspecting them and opening
doors, something he very kindly ceases
on request. They’re all in here some-
where, the copperheads, the brown
snakes, the tiger snakes, the black
snakes, the whip snakes, the slate-grey
snakes, the Macleay water snakes, and
five species of python—including one
who’s been off his grub for five months
and the way things are going may end
up as shoes. There’s a bootmaker look-
ing forward to his arrival in Adelaide.

ONE MORE
WEEK
Gladrags
ELABORATE camouflage is being
tried in an apparent attempt to make
American Servicemen on leave in Syd-
ney from Vietnam blend into the local
scenery. The visitors have been
“advised” by their own authorities not
to wear dark glasses or smoke cigars,
and they are wearing Australian clothes
during their stay.
The men arrive in uniform, then
choose outer clothing, except shoes.
For the five days they hire a suit, or
a sports jacket and trousers, two shirts,
tie, and belt for $lO. At the end of
the visit the clothes go back into the
stock of the Sydney manufacturer who
won the contract to supply the clothes,
and are on the racks for the next batch
of arrivals. Of course, in time, some of
the more enterprising young women
around town may learn to recognise the
clothes, even if the face is unfamiliar.
Champagne for one
IN A TERRIBLY dull Melbourne
Show Week this story had a rare and
beautiful quality. The hour was 2 a.m.
When Dante Triaca answered the door
at his Triaca’s Hotel in Exhibition
Street.
A very, very happy South Australian
grazier was standing outside with a
ram with a blue ribbon round its neck.
“What could you do?” said Dante. “He
was so pleased you couldn’t turn him
away.” So he took grazier and ram
upstairs in the lift and gave them a
suite.
The grazier then asked for a drink
for his prizewinner. Beer? Water?
“Geez, no,” said the grazier. “This ani-
mal is worth $6OOO. Get him cham-
pagne.” So champagne was poured into
a bowl, plus an aspirin. Then they
took a blanket off the bed and accom-
modated the champagne-drinking ram
in the bathroom.
Both ram and grazier slept sweetly
and triumphantly. And if you don’t
believe us, ask Dante Triaca. He said:
“No names, please.”
Constant caller
SIR MALCOLM SARGENT, who
died in London last week, came to
Australia seven times. The first time
was in 1936 when he was the first over-
seas conductor at the subscription series
arranged by the Australian Broadcast-
ing Commission; the last visit was in
April this year.
Australia’s debt to Sir Malcolm is
immense. His combination of musical
and social gifts (on concert tours he
generally stayed at Government House
in each State) made him the prototype
of the conductor the ABC is always
seeking for its orchestras on a per-
manent basis: someone who is musically
sound and who can get along with
people.
Former general manager of the ABC,
Sir Charles Moses, recalled that Sir
Malcolm’s first concert here in 1936
included Elgar’s “The Dream of Geron-
tius.” Two years later Sargent was
back and conducted at a concert in
Sydney with players from the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra and Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra combined.
“Sir Malcolm then said that Austra-
lia should concentrate all its best
players into one good orchestra,” Sir
Charles said. “We did not do this, for-
tunately, because we now have several
good orchestras. Of course, no one
could have visualised the strides that
we were going to make in music in
this country.”
Goldrush
WHILE so many writers are preoccu-
pied with the national identity of the
Australian of the 19605, poet and
anthologist Nancy Keesing has brought
out a book about Australians of a cen-
tury ago, those who went to the gold-
rushes.
An account by a young British
naval officer who inspected the gold-
fields described them this way: “There
is a curious mixture of persons here,
a few being decayed gentlemen and
not a small sprinkling of seamen, which
I was sorry to see . . . The general
good behaviour and even civility among
all classes was most striking, and I
saw but one drunken man during the
day among the tents.”
His is one of 127 pieces which Miss
Keesing has unearthed in libraries and
extracted from private manuscripts in
2\ years of research for her book “Gold
Fever.” “It’s by no means definitive
for instance, I haven’t used anything
from all the ne.wspapers published
during the goldrush days,” she said.
“And I’ve still got enough for a
second book. I’ll never do it, of course.
I’ve always thought that the best Aus-
tralian writing is along documentary
lines, and I think these pieces bear
out the truth of this, even in the early
days.”
Mr. H. A. Ellis, a retired geologist
in Western Australia, is the only living
contributor to the anthology. His pre-
viously unpublished account of a 1936
expedition to find the fabled Lassetter’s
Reef closes the book, bringing the story
of the goldfields into this century.
Miss Keesing’s jackdaw qualities
first developed when she worked on her
first anthology, “Australian Bush Bal-
lads,” which she and Douglas Stewart
had published in 1955. This was fol-
lowed in 1957 by “Old Bush Songs,”
and they will soon be bringing out a
collection of the best of both books.
“The first one took a couple of years
to get together. We didn’t quite know
where to start, so we got the Mitchell
Library to drag out every publication
with ‘bush,’ ‘song,’ or ‘ballad’ in the
title. We turned up all kinds of
things.
“It was strange when we started,
Burl Ives had been in Australia and
at first had been told there was no
Australian folk material. Then a col-
lector in Melbourne gave him the
material for his first Australian record,
but there was nothing else other than
some sheet-music produced by Mar-
garet Sutherland and Vance Palmer.
After that, though, the Bush Music
Clubs started, and it all snowballed
from there. I think even without the
folk revival, all these things would have
brought the music to light.”

MOST OF US don’t give a damn, but
Australians should be really worried
about the mess the Western world is
making of its relations with the under-
developed countries. For a large num-
ber of the underdevelopeds are very
close to us; apart from being trading
partners (who would become much
better customers if only they were
not so poor), the underdeveloped
countries of South-East Asia are get-
ting such a raw deal that they are in
real danger of complete disenchant-
ment with the Western world. And
no wonder. As the rich nations of the
world get steadily richer (with one or
two exceptions, like Britain and New
Zealand), the poorer nations are get-
ting steadily poorer and hungrier.
And the reason is not the infertility of
their soil qr the indolence or stupidity
or dishonesty of their peoples. It is
largely the result of conscious policies
being pursued by the rich countries of
the world; policies that put short-term
economic self-interest before long-term
responsibilities; policies that are restrict-
ing the scope for economic growth of
the heavily populated underdeveloped
countries in order to protect the inter-
ests of small groups in the rich coun-
tries; policies that are bringing re-
lations between the rich countries and
the poor countries to the brink of dis-
aster.
And we are right on the edge of
it all. South Asia is the slowest grow-
ing region in the world in terms of
gross domestic production. Its rate of
growth in the 1960 s has been even
slower than in the 19505. In terms of
growth per head of the rapidly rising
population, it has averaged less than
1 percent a year so far this decade; even
southern Europe has managed an
annual growth rate of 5.7 percent in
this time. Things are only a little better
in East Asia (Nationalist China, Indo-
nesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines,
Thailand, and South Vietnam), where
the growth in real terms of gross
domestic product per head has reached
2.3 percent.
This slow rate of growth means that
nearly two-thirds of the population of
the 95 less-developed countries of the
world live in areas where the standard
of living has either risen only very
slightly so far this decade or else has
actually declined. The recent annual
report of the World Bank is a. horrify-
ing document, not because it talks
about starvation and not only for the
facts it reveals about the increasing
poverty of the poorer nations and the
increasing riches of the developed coun-
tries but because of the lack of effec-
tive action to do anything about it.
The World Bank reports that in 40
developing countries it surveyed, agri-
cultural output lagged behind popula-
lation rise—and agriculture is the main
industry in most of them. On top of
that, the World Bank’s report gloomily
says that not only has the slowdown
in world trade adversely affected de-
mand for most primary commodities
but the prospect for the remainder of
the 1960 s seems to be for an even
slower growth in the export earnings
of the underdeveloped countries.
So the developing countries in the
World Bank’s list had a trade deficit
of $U.5.5300 million last year, follow-
ing the third successive worsening in
their trade position; in three years the
adverse trade gap has got 47 percent
worse. And since aid is not big enough
to close the gap, the developing coun-
tries lost a further $U.5.1390 million
of their international reserves to their
richer neighbors in 1965, the latest
figures available.
This is the crux of the whole prob-
lem. It is a disaster of modern capital-
ism that government and institutions
in rich countries recognise the justice
of demands for higher wages for
workers but refuse to recognise the
same justice in their dealings with the
underdeveloped countries.
It has largely been as a result of
wage rises and other benefits that the
cost of industrial products of the
developed countries has continually
risen since the war. But the “wage”
that the rich countries are prepared to
pay for the commodities they use in
these products and which come from
the underdeveloped countries is not
subject to such humanitarian consider-
ations. It depends for most of them
on what price the rich countries can
knock the sellers down to. So the com-
modity producers find they have to
grow and sell more commodities at
steady or even falling prices to be
able to buy the products of the indus-
trialised countries, the prices of which
are steadily rising. One example of
the effect of this is that in 1965 prices
that developing countries had to pay
for their imports had risen faster than
the aid they received, so the real value
of the aid they got was less than four
years previously.
Then why don’t these developing
countries do something about it; set
up new industries and export their
products? The answer in fearfully
many cases is that the tariff policies of
the rich nations prevent the poorer
countries from getting access to their
markets in manufactured goods. This
is regarded as “unfair” competition
from cheap labor areas, and so the rich
countries keep it out.
The latest example of this is the
desperate position facing Malaysia be-
cause of the fall in rubber prices (as
the U.S. Government depressed the
market by selling from its stockpile);
it is the same problem that typifies the
problem that exists over most of South-
East Asia, from Indian jute to
Indonesian coffee. There is no doubt,
of course, that some of the producing
countries add to their own problems,
like Malayasia adding to the costs of
rubber production by splitting up the
old big estates and so on. But this is
not the major point.
As the “Far Eastern Economic Re-
view” said in a recent editorial, the
advanced nations could make the pro-
cess of improving efficiency in pro-
ducer nations less painful if aid
programs were more lavish and specifi-
cally geared toward raising production
standards. And then it urged the
establishment of industries to process
these raw materials in the countries
where they are produced. “This will
only work if the ‘North’ abandons
its tariff policies, which are designed
to give the developed countries a
monopoly of the world’s processing
industries. Asia by itself cannot over-
come the problems created by declining
commodity prices. The region des-
perately needs generous treatment
from outside to assist the drive to
come to terms with the difficulties
caused by the march of science that
has so enriched the industrialised
economies.”
The crisis of the underdeveloped
countries will reach a head next
February in Delhi, when UNCTAD,
the United Nations body that tries to
help the less developed countries, will
hold its second conference. This will
deal with recommendations about tariffs,
commodity agreements, and aid that
are vital to their future. The tariff
proposal is the basic one—and is of
particular relevance to Australia, with
its high protective barrier against the
major manufactured products of so
many of the underdeveloped countries.
The proposal is that developed coun-
tries should not only get rid of their
barriers against products of under-
developed countries but actually give
them a tariff preference. But even if
they agreed, the rich nations would no
doubt demand a restrictive quota, to
keep the trade under control, so the
prospect of even such a progressive
move as this paying off for the under-
develops do not seem bright.
The problem is not just one of find-
ing enough aid. The old catchcry of
“trade not aid” is as real as ever; all
that the underdeveloped really need is
a fair deal.

AS I SEE IT
Can Holt's
Second XI
handle Whitlam?
By ALAN REID
IF THE PRIME MINISTER, Mr.
Harold Holt, has any sense he will,
after last week, realise that he has
another major problem on his plate.
This is the problem of Liberal-Country
Party relationships and the weakening
effect their deterioration is having upon
the day-to-day effectiveness of his ad-
ministration.
As I see it, the Liberals and Country
Party have over recent years been able
to feud with impunity. No matter how
stupidly resentful of each other they
became, they basically did not have
anything really at stake. Labor was
so disorganised and electorally unpopu-
lar that they .would survive as a
Government whatever the state of their
internal relationships.
While Sir Robert was Prime Minister
he was a stablising influence.
A product of his own history, he
realised that he lost the Prime Minis-
tership back in 1941 because the
Liberal-CP coalition of that day fell to
pieces. He was determined that history
would not repeat itself, and when things
developed really dangerously he al-
ways intervened to dampen down
excessive enmities.
But the situation has changed con-
siderably over recent months. I must
confess I do not pay too much at-
tention to by-election results and con-
sequently Capricornia and Corio are
to me interesting rather than significant.
I cannot remember in my time in
politics and that is nigh on 30
years any Government winning an
Opposition-held seat in a by-election. 1
watched Labor win the blue ribbon
Liberal seat of Flinders in the 1952
by-election with a majority of nearly
4300 over the Liberal candidate, saw
it return to the Liberals at the 1954
general election with a 1500 majority,
and lived long enough to watch another
13 years of Liberal Government.
Experiences like that do not leave
you with a great deal of faith in the
value of by-elections as pointers to the
future.
Nevertheless, there is a changed
situation in Federal politics that makes
this issue of Liberal-Country Party re-
lationship much more important than
it has been in the past.
The changed situation has been
produced by the new Labor leader,
Gough Whitlam. Either Whitlam him-
self (or his advisers) have reverted to
the acceptance of the shrewd axiom
that Oppositions under our democratic
set-up do not win elections. Govern-
ments lose them; though, paradoxic-
ally, Governments can be helped to
win elections by the idiocies of Oppo-
sitions.
Whitlam is. concentrating upon
building up a good public image of
Whitlam, saying not what Labor pro-
poses to do (a habit to which both
his immediate predecessors, Arthur
Calwell and the late Dr. Evatt, were
prone), but concentrating upon what
the Government is doing or is failing to
do, and glossing over the fact that the
ALP machine, over which he is presid-
ing, rather than leading, is still basic-
ally the ALP structure that has been
rejected by the Australian elector with
increasing severity at elections over
the past decade.
His speech on the Budget was a
criticism of the Budget rather than an
exposition of how Labor would handle
the situation. As regards Vietnam (the
issue that cost Labor so dear elector-
ally at the last election) he is in effect
saying, “Labor policy has no relevance
we are not the Government.”
It is possible to maintain this atti-
tude in politics only while you can
get away with it. Whitlam is un-
doubtedly getting away with it, and
this is where the Liberal-CP relation-
ships become a factor.
’One effect of the immensity of
Menzies’ stature during his 17 years’
rule of the Liberal-CP Coalition is
that beneath his large shadow few
among his followers were able to
develop their own stature. The only
people who had stature during the
Menzies administration were Holt him-
self and the Country Party Leader
John McEwen. Since Menzies’ resigna-
tion, Treasurer William McMahon,
External Affairs Minister Paul Has-
luck, and Defence Minister Allen Fair-
hall have undoubtedly become more
prominent, but with the possible
exception of McMahon prominent
on the administrative rather than the
political side.
This weakness on the political side
came through on the debate on the
Hong Kong petitions signed by five
members of the Victorian ALP Execu-
tive and an N.S.W. ALP Executive
member in the terms of a protest note
sent to and rejected by the British
Labor Government.
On the rights or wrongs of the issue,
the Holt Government could not lose.
The facts spoke for themselves. Here
were members of the ruling elite of
the ALP joining with Communists in
a protest against the actions of British
authorities in Hong Kong trying to
maintain law and order and apprehend
the murderers of Hong Kong citizens.
Whitlam could not win. So what he
set out to do was to try to ensure that
he did not lose. And I think he suc-
ceeded in this. He made a brilliant
debating speech which neither of the
Ministerial spokesmen put up by the
Government Transport Minister
Gordon Freeth nor Immigration Minis-
ter Billie Snedden could handle. But
it was only a debating speech. It had
so many holes in it that if you
inspected it in dingo country you’d go
home and get your rifle.
His speech, in fact, went some way
to establishing what the Ministers were
trying ineffectively to establish that
on this question of association with
Communism he was all talk and no do.
He deplored the description of the
British authorities in Hong Kong as
“fascist-like,” said that this descrip-
tion was “unwarranted, ill-informed,
and reprehensible,” but then refused to
vote to censure those who had sent the
petitions. “They (the views in the peti-
tion) would not hit the deck at any
meetings of (ALP) or trade union
bodies if they were moved,” he
declared, magnificently.
He ignored the fact that he had al-
ready described members of the Vic-
torian ALP Executive as “an influential
handful of men who had flouted ALP
policy on unity tickets, organised or led
political strikes in defiance of the
ACTU, disregarded and repudiated
ALP and ACTU policy on the man-
ning of ships to Vietnam, and organised
demonstrations against the Trades Hall
Council Executive.”
Just viewing it as a parliamentary
exercise, I think that the outcome of the
debate would have been completely
different if the Government had put
up McEwen to follow Whitlam.
Labor would still be licking its
wounds, as it was after the last time
McEwen participated in a political
debate, which significantly is as long
ago as March 29 last year, when he
bought, devastatingly from Labor’s,
viewpoint, into a debate on Labor’s
changed foreign affairs policy.
This is only a minor aspect of how
Liberal-CP relationships and their
present strained nature are weakening
the effectiveness of the Liberal-CP
Coalition Government as a parliamen-
tary force.
But Holt, in view of the shortage of
political as distinct from administrative
thinkers in Cabinet, obviously needs to
utilise effectively whatever political
strength there is in his Cabinet. And
equally obviously, while the present
state of Liberal-CP relationships con-
tinues, this political strength is not going
to be used. It is a problem that sooner
or later he has to face up to.


AUSTRALIA
Good reason for Australia to
help New Zealand (more?)
WHEN EXTERNAL Affairs Minister
Hasluck was in New Zealand in June,
he said he sympathised with N.Z.’s
hesitancy in developing relations with
Australia. He had been brought up and
lived far away from the eastern heart
of Australia. As a Western Australian
he was farther from Sydney than New
Zealanders. Sand-gropers, as they were
called once, shared with Kiwis similar
feelings about the big neighbor in the
middle “feelings which may have
an element of envy, some tingle of fear,
and perhaps a suspicion, too, that be-
cause our neighbor is more prosperous
than we are, he must necessarily have
grabbed more than was due to him.”
And so Mr. Hasluck correctly pre-
dicted. For last week, on his first visit,
Mr. Holyoake went out of his way to
whinge about the workings of NAFTA,
the convenient acronym for our
recent free-trade agreement. He had
intended at first indeed to devote the
whole of his official speech at the par-
liamentary luncheon to economic re-
lations between the two countries, but
the Australians diplomatically, of
course urged him to talk of less
contentious things: the Anzac tradition
and fighting side-by-side. And to give
Vietnam and the American alliance a
plug. He obliged by doing those things,
pronouncing the familiar phrases, in a
rather belabored manner, but he re-
turned to prepared notes when express-
ing his dissatisfaction with the workings
of NAFTA, specifically referring to the
forest products dispute.
When pressed on the subject, how-
ever, N.Z. officials are not nearly so
critical of Australia as their boss
appeared to be. The position at present
is that both Governments have agreed
the matter should be left to the two
disputing firms APM and Tasman
Pulp - to resolve between them. They
are in the middle of that, and there is
no indication of any breakdown in
negotiations.
The only conclusion must be that
Mr. Holyoake’s outburst was a sop to
the domestic New Zealand suspicions
of which Mr. Hasluck spoke. Austra-
lia’s dealings with New Zealand have
been so far on a tough, dollar-for-
dollar basis. It has been very much a
matter for the Trade Department,
which is well known for its fierce pur-
suit of the interests of Australian manu-
facturers, and its subsidiary but signi-
ficant concern for powerful rural lobbies
Prime Minister Holyoake... proper
protection
such as the dairyfarmers. The New
Zealanders never really wanted a cross-
the-board free-trade arrangement. They
wanted a forest products deal which
would open the large and rapidly ex-
panding Australian market for paper
and timber to the highly efficient pro-
ducts of a country with ideal climatic
conditions for growing trees.
But the Australian Trade Depart-
ment, with promises of an umbrella of
proper protection for N.Z. manufac-
turers, offers of access for meat and
cheese, and plans for eventual action
on the tricky question of access for
butter, got the New Zealanders to
agree to the framework for an all-
round Trade Agreement. Each year
the Governments are committed to
confer to add to the list of goods to
be put on the free trade list.
Both sides agree that the Agreement
is unlikely to achieve quick spectacular
breakthroughs, but that it does give
hope for steady year-by-year progress.
The greatest potential for progress in
economic relations lies in two areas
not being given publicity. One is what
the bureaucrats call three-seven arrange-
ments, the jargon term for negotiated
industrial tie-ups, whereby a New Zea-
land firm in return for gaining big
orders for the supply of, say, fan-belts
to an Australian car manufacturer will
be given an opportunity to act as agent
for a number of duty-free Australian
cars.
In return for large-scale, highly pro-
fitable New Zealand manufacturing con-
tracts for small component items, re-
latively cheap Australian manufactures
will gradually become available to the
N.Z. purchaser.
Three such tie-ups have already been
agreed on; deals are being talked about
in the car industry, electrical motors,
lift components, chemicals, electrical,
and radio components.
The other possible breakthrough is
in Australia providing New Zealand
with the opportunity to compete more
freely in the export of its traditional
primary products. Right now there are
a series of barriers we hold up against
the influx of New Zealand products.
The Australian Health Department’s
overzealous officials (encouraged no
doubt by local interests) are often
extraordinarily restrictive in their
treatment of New Zealanders.
Our friends across the Tasman have
strict quarantine regulations them-
selves and good animal health stand-
ards. But our people seem to regard
them as dangerous purveyors of exotic
wogs. Their cattle are not allowed to
be exported here, despite the fact that
the alleged offending wog, “blue
tongue,” is as carefully guarded against
in N.Z. as here. For some unknown
reason, our Health Department puts
barriers in the way of the N.Z. export
of sheep, which not only has prevented
the New Zealanders earning some
foreign exchange but has also hindered
us in rebuilding our livestock numbers
after droughts.
There is no substantive argument
either for our embargo on potato im-
ports or for our restrictions on New
Zealand early spring mutton. The New
Zealand seasonal surplus comes when
we are still afflicted by seasonal short-
ages.
Australian Trade Department
officials are insistent, too, that “eventu-
ally” (when they are retired?) they
want to see the really dicky question
of free trade in dairy products tackled.
They have started by providing New
Zealand with an import quota for
cheese, duty-free, and want to expand
this year by year. But they are quick
to admit that some time we will have
to get around to some scheme to let
the New Zealanders sell butter here.
This is where some Australian
officials outside the Trade Department
mesh in with their arguments about
Australia-New Zealand relations. They
say that if Australians are serious about
letting the New Zealanders in, we will
have to be prepared to offer them more
in hard-cash profits for less in the way
of economic sacrifices. It is time, in
other words, that Australia’s Govern-
ment started to think beyond financial
profitability in dealing with its small
brother across' the Tasman.


How? By immediately stating that
Australia intends to see that New
Zealand gets a fair go selling its paper
products here. By putting some Com-
monwealth forestry development money
into New Zealand as well as into the
Australian States. By urging Australian
firms to set up plants in New Zealand,
so undermining New Zealand fears that
Australians want them to act as a
quarry to supply the crude materials
for our industries. By offering really
generous, cost-price, credit arrange-
ments for New Zealand to purchase
Australian-produced defence equipment,
and offering them free servicing for
their aircraft.
The clinching argument of this is
that Australia has a strong long-term
interest in helping New Zealand get
out of its immediate economic diffi-
culties. These have meant that it has
felt constrained to grow almost naked
militarily. New Zealand’s regular army
numbers 5620, with six transport heli-
copters. In Vietnam until recently it
had only six guns. Now it has added a
company of foot soldiers, but only at
the expense of cutting by a third its
commitment to the Malaysia-Singapore
region.
What the New Zealanders really need
is a Singapore approach to their prob-
lems —a tough vigorous administration
which devotes itself to establishing
manufacturing based on exports to solve
its balance of payments problems, and
is prepared to put up with the unpopu-
larity of conscription in order to build
a meaningful defence force.
ALP leaders
When two minds do
not think alike
A WIDE GAP BETWEEN the think-
ing of Labor’s Gough Whitlam and his
counterpart in the Senate, Lionel
Murphy, was visible last week in the
political action Labor followed in the
two Chambers after Prime Minister
Holt’s statement on the use of VIP
aircraft.
An amazed Government learnt on
Wednesday shortly before Prime
Minister Holt was to make his
statement in the House of Representa-
tives that Labor MHRs would not be
carrying on with the debate. At the
time Government Whips were selecting
Speakers for the expected “no holds
barred” affair. But, as the Melbourne
“Age” pointed out next morning, as far
as the House of Representatives was
concerned it was a “damp squib.”
Opposition members in the Senate,
with several Government “scalps”
already to their credit this year, includ-
ing the mid-session rejection of the
Post Office regulations, were prepared
to make as much political capital out
Murphy...
scalps
Whitlam...
no holds
of the issue as possible and, under
Senator Murphy’s now thoroughly
respected manoeuvring, succeeded be-
yond their expectations.
They even coaxed three Government
members to cross the floor which,
with the added weight of the DLP’s
representation of two (both of whom
object strongly to the Government’s
ruling that they cannot use VIP air-
craft), plus the two Independents, gave
the Government its soundest thrashing
since 1949. Full credit must go to
Lionel Murphy.
The amendment, introduced at the
11th hour by Senator Hartley Cant, of
Western Australia (and disclaimed by
Government Leader Senator Henty as
“The worst experience I have had in
my 18 years in this place ... I have
never seen this type of behaviour be-
fore”), was couched in similar terms
to Murphy’s notice of motion already
on the Senate notice paper. There was
little doubt who was the tactician be-
hind the development.
The Government will try to obey
the Senate’s direction to table the costs
and details of operations of the VIP
flight. The Prime Minister has asked
his Ministers to advise him whether
“any meaningful, useful dissection of
costs can be made.”
In the meantime, Opposition Leader
Whitlam (who is reported privately
to have declared he would not
debate the use of VIP aircraft
because he supported their use)
privately, if not publicly, faces growing
condemnation by disappointed Party
members over his attitude and refusal
to try to make political capital out
of what is regarded by many members
of the Labor Party as a vote-winning
issue.
Whitlam also has to shoulder the
knowledge that his rival in the Senate,
Lionel Murphy, long regarded as his
opposition within the Opposition, is
going to collect a lot more kudos over
his latest achievement, and after this
is not likely to have much regard for
Whitlam’s advice on debating proced-
ure.
High Court case
The ACTU's tilt at total wage
THIS WEEK the Federal wage-fixing
system went on trial in Sydney for a
second time when the High Court be-
gan hearing an ACTU “appeal” against
the Arbitration Commission’s total wage
decision last June. The ACTU took
out three Writs of Prohibition against
members of the Arbitration Commis-
sion’s Reference Bench, which included
Commissioner Winter, mainly on the
grounds that it did not have the
power to change the basic wage
under Section 33 of the Conciliation
and Arbitration Act, which limits this
power to a Bench of Judges.
These writs are also directed against
Senior Commissioner Taylor and
Commissioner Portus, who applied the
$1 increase to most of the 380 Federal
awards and agreements, when the trade
unions showed reluctance to apply for
it. Only 70 or so remain to be amended.
During the national wage case two
Benches sat conjointly to hear three
applications: the employers’ for total
wage, and the ACTU’s for basic wage
and margins increases. The result was
a unanimous decision to lump together
the old basic wage and margin for
skill, express them as a total wage,
and award the $1 increase to both men
and women.
Now the ACTU has applied also for
a Writ of Mandamus directed at the
second Bench the President, Sir
Richard Kirby, Mr. Justice Gallagher,
and Mr. Justice Moore. If granted by
the High Court it would command
this Bench to hear and determine the
ACTU’s original basic wage increase
application.
The High Court proceedings have not
only held up finalising the remaining
awards, but have interfered with moves
aimed at getting an equal pay case
on a broad basis to the Arbitration
Commission.
The ACTU challenge is the first
aimed at: the Arbitration Commission,
which was set up under amended
legislation in 1956, after a High Court
finding that the old Arbitration Court
did not have power to make awards for
settling industrial disputes, and also the
power to enforce them.
The Menzies Government then set up
the Arbitration Commission, and also
the Commonwealth Industrial Court,
with enforcing powers. This time,
should the High Court upset the pres-
ent system, Mr. Holt’s Government
could be embarrassed in having to
introduce further amending legislation
on the eve of a Senate election.


Voyager Royal Commission
50 days' proceeding half speed ahead
AFTER 50 DAYS’ hearing evidence
from more than 100 witnesses the sec-
ond Voyager Royal Commission was
still groping last week toward the
establishment of one basic matter: was
Captain Duncan Stevens of Voyager
fit to command his ship, or unfit as
alleged by his former executive officer,
Lieutenant-Commander Peter Cabban.
Cabban’s evidence was not brought
forward during the first Royal Com-
mission which sat for 55 days and
heard 155 witnesses while determining
the facts of the Voyager-Melbourne col-
lision. Last week the present Com-
mission’s average of two witnesses a
day was being speeded up, mainly by
president Sir Stanley Burbury’s careful
but sharp assessment of what current
evidence might have been covered
before.
In the roughly 50-feet-square court-
room in Sydney, present and former
RAN men, just arrived from or about
to return to such places as Melbourne,
Townsville, and Singapore, were still
trying to give the Commission a clear
picture of events up to four years ago,
when Voyager was on a Tokyo visit
and Captain Stevens may or may not
have drunk too much on specified
occasions, and turned his ship over
to Lieutenant-Commander Cabban for
the first few days out of port.
As they searched their minds for
answers to questions put to them by
some dozen counsel, the young men on
the stand screwed up their eyes and
seemed to be staring at the fluores-
cent lights overhead, the wall panelling,
the lawyers around their volume-
stacked table, the public including
members of the Stevens family, the
large scale model of Voyager across
the room, or the three Commissioners
seated at their right under the Com-
monwealth coat-of-arms.
But the real search was within their
minds, for the actual in the vague,
blurred, time-distorted pictures of shore
parties, men present at either of two
defaulter’s parades on a certain day
four years back, and which officer had
been present at each parade. It would
seem a pretty hopeless business to the
layman.
The Commissioners: Mr. Justice Asprey, Sir Stanley Burbury, and Mr. Justice
Lucas outside the Court in Phillip Street , Sydney
Only one event gave it life during
the week: the refusal of a Melbourne
“Truth” journalist to name his source
for information contained in a news-
paper article with the heading
“Drunken Duncan.” The Commission
has no power to commit for contempt,
but the Royal Commission Act pro-
vides a penalty of $lOOO. The appropri-
ate papers were to go to the Attorney-
General this week.
For all the painstaking slowness of
the proceedings, or because of it, the
Commission-room atmosphere after
those 50 days was relaxed but not flat:
the Commissioners retained enough
sparkle for occasional bubbles of wit
to reach the surface; and even the
Service-conscious witnesses smiled
through their cautious nervousness. The
legal men, despite fees running from
hundreds of guineas for brief appear-
ances to many thousands for continued
attendance, looked about the most
downcast there.
Superannuation
Whose initiative?
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT
has agreed in principle to set up a
scheme which would make superannua-
tion results portable from one job to
another, but like its Budget proposal to
widen the range of stamp duties it is
running into big problems of practice.
Comforted by solid support for the
principle from Mr. S. W. Caffin, the
Commonwealth Insurance Commis-
sioner, in a talk to the Institute of
Actuaries in Canberra last week, the
Government hopes to get at least a
limited scheme off the ground and lead
the way for other States to follow.
The Government’s present idea is to
make it obligatory for firms taking on
new employees to take over and con-
tinue superannuation policies initiated
by previous employers. By this it would
end a long-held grievance that on leav-
ing a job an employee receives only
what he has put into superannuation
and pension funds and has to start all
over again in his new employment, thus
losing all the benefits from money put
in by his old employers. It would also
materially assist the mobility of labor
and remove the suspicion that many
employers use the forfeiture of super-
annuation rights to bind their staffs.
In its present form the proposal is
to make the registration of all super-
annuation funds in Victoria compulsory,
to provide powers for their supervision
by the Government, and subject them
to audit. This is coupled with the sug-
gestion that the investments of the funds
should also be supervised so as to
safeguard them from capital loss, say
from company failures. This has
already had an unfavorable reaction
from managers of some of the big funds
who prize the right to put their money
where they want to and have made
some very big kills in equity invest-
ments over the years.
Mr. Caffin got heavy support from
the actuaries for his advocacy of port-
able pensions, and the provision of paid-
up superannuation benefits. Some at the
Canberra conference believed that the
Commonwealth and State Governments
should take the initiative in leading
private firms to adopt them by making
Public Service accrued pension funds
portable. Mr. L. T. Cohn, of the
National Mutual Life Association,
thought this would help to sell the idea
generally; but, he said, most of the life
offices in Australia and N.Z. have trans-
fer schemes operating already even if
not on a wide scale.
The “Age”
New era
WHEN 89-YEAR-OLD Mr. Oswald
Syme died last week, the new era at
“The Age” formally began. “The Syd-
ney Morning Herald” group became a
joint controller of one of Australia’s
most respected newspapers. On his
death, the arrangements that were an-
nounced last December by which the
SMH, through John Fairfax and Sons
Ltd., was to become an equal member
with the Syme family in a partnership
controlling David Syme & Co. Ltd.
(publisher of “The Age”), now come
into effect.
The deals that took place last Decem-
ber, when John Fairfax was allotted
one million shares in David Syme (for
$2.22 million) and also bought an un-
disclosed number of shares from the
beneficiaries (apparently on a delayed
delivery basis), had not of themselves
given the Fairfax group any real con-
trol over “The Age.” The David Syme
trustees continued to hold a controlling


interest in David Syme & Co. Ltd. until
the trust’s termination. And that was
on the death of Oswald, the last remain-
ing son of “The Age’s” founder, David
Syme. The David Syme Trust, compris-
ing beneficiaries under the will of David
Syme, had held 60 percent of “The
Age’s” capital before the placement of
one million shares with the SMH re-
duced this proportion to 50 percent.
The SMH deal means that, from last
week, all these Syme family shares
(there had been three million of them
before an unstated number were sold
to the SMH) will now be “committed
to the partnership” between the Syme
trustees and the SMH. The partner-
ship will control four million of David
Syme’s six million shares. Under the
scheme, two John Fairfax men and two
representatives of the Syme beneficiaries
will operate the partnership with equal
rights. What happens if they disagree
has not been publicly explained.
The SMH group has acquired half
of the control but has probably only
had to buy one-third of the shares
(two million out of the six million on
issue) to do so. The other side of this
coin is that two-thirds of the share-
holders (the Syme family and the pub-
lic) have been left with only half the
control. So it does not seem a very
good deal for them, especially as the
chances of getting a good price for
their shares if any other groups had
wanted to make takeover offers has
now gone.
Had it not been for the SMH deal,
the death of Oswald and the end of
the trust, after 59 years, would have
meant that the family’s holding would
have been split up among the second-,
third-, and fourth-generation descend-
ents of Mr. David Syme. These bene-
ficiaries would then have been free to
do what they liked with their shares,
which could well have fallen into the
hands of rival newspaper groups. (The
Melbourne “Herald” group had already
acquired 10 percent of the shares.)
Instead of that, “The Age” has sought
out a big brother to keep other intrud-
ers away. The extent to which its
new big brother will try to tell its little
brother how to behave is yet to be
seen. Partnerships are the business
equivalent of marriages; easy enough
to get into, hard to run, and difficult
and expensive to get out of.
Divorce
Non-publication
THERE WAS LITTLE interest in
May last year, when an undefended
divorce matter came before a Supreme
Court judge in Melbourne. The case
would have passed almost unnoticed,
but for the judge making a non-
publication order under Section 123 of
the Commonwealth Matrimonial
Causes Act, 1959.
This section of the Act carries a
restriction that nothing else can be
published except names, addresses, and
occupations of the parties and wit-
nesses, the name or names of the mem-
ber or members of the court and of
the counsel and solicitors. The section
also goes on to, say that even these
items can be the subject of a non-
publication order.
The penalty for a first offence is a
fine of $lOOO or six months’ imprison-
ment. For the second offence it is a
fine not exceeding $2OOO or imprison-
ment, not xceeding one year. As far
as it is known, these penalties have
not yet been imposed, but Australian
newspapers and magazines have chosen
not to disobey the judge’s order. Simi-
lar fears have stopped overseas’ publi-
cations, particularly the London-based
ones, from using the details of this
divorce.
Overtures were made to several
Labor Federal MPs to have the matter
mentioned in Canberra, under parlia-
mentary privilege. Labor’s Federal
Caucus put a stop to this.
Now the case but certainly not
the details is back in the news
following Independent Senator Turn-
bull’s appeal to the Government to
review the Act and take the special
power to suppress names, etc., away
from the judiciary.
Senator Turnbull, referring to the
case in Victoria, said he would not
abuse his parliamentary privilege by
revealing the names of the parties in-
volved.
He added: “However, it has been
reported to me that because of the
publicity given to the matter many
people in Victoria have come under
suspicion, as it were. As far as I know,
the person involved in the case I have
in mind does not live in Australia
at this time, which should make it
clear to those people in Victoria that
the bone is not pointed at them.”
The Senator’s remarks make it clear
that there have been several non-
publication orders made since May last
year in Supreme Court in Melbourne.
One of the judges does not believe
in such orders and, in fact, has made
only one, years ago. These views are
not shared by the judge who presided
in the case referred to by Senator
Turnbull.
TAB, or Services' SP?
Bets for the hoys
Shot down, one low-flying kite
THE TAB IN VICTORIA is prepared
to organise betting facilities for Austra-
lian troops in Vietnam over the Caul-
field and Melbourne Cups period, and
even more regularly if Commonwealth
and Army authorities approve.
The general manager of the TAB in
Victoria, Mr. Davis, told The Bulletin
last week that he could readily organise
staff to fly to Saigon, Vung Tau, and
other places where Australian troops are
stationed. “We can offer them betting
facilities for the two Cup meetings,
or even regular Saturday betting
facilities if the Commonwealth Govern-
ment can arrange for communications.”
There are two possibilities open to
the TAB for relaying information back
from Vietnam. One is to use the
Seacom capacity co-axial cable with
Hong Kong as the relay point. The
cable runs via Cairns, Madang, and
Guam to Hong Kong, which has a
direct radio link with Saigon.
The other is through the Army’s
direct radio - teletype contact with
Saigon. At present the Army circuits
carry operational messages only and
are not normally used to full capacity.
Informed of the TAB’s offer, an
Army spokesman said last week that
no official approach had been made on
the matter and that it was not the
policy of the Army “to chase kites.”
He instanced the case of a well-known
Australian entertainer who had made a
number of offers through the Press to
tour Vietnam, but never to the Army
direct. “And until he does,” said the
officer, “he can stay back home.”
The Bulletin informed Mr. Davis of
the Army’s attitude and asked him
whether he intended to renew the
TAB’s offer direct to Army head-
quarters or the Minister. Mr. Davis
said his offer still stood and his
organisation was prepared to arrange
for its facilities to be used by the troops
at any time. However, he did not intend
to make a formal approach and would
wait until the Army requested his or-
ganisation’s services.
So the Army won’t chase kites, and
the TAB will not make a further
approach to the Army. And thus the
home fires keep on burning.

Asia
after
Vietnam
By RICHARD M. NIXON
Written by the man who could
become the next President
of the United States, this article
represents a seeking for alternatives
to the present administration policy
that could later revolutionise the
American role in Asia.
"If our long-range aim is to pull China back into the family of nations,
\ve must avoid the impression that the great powers or the European
powers are 'ganging up'; the response should clearly be one of active
defence rather than potential offence, and must be untainted
with any suspicion of racism .. . For the United States to go it alone in
containing China would not only place an unconscionable burden on
our own country but also would heighten the chances of nuclear war
while undercutting the independent development of the nations of Asia."
"Weary with war, disheartened with allies, disillusioned with aid,
dismayed at domestic crises, many Americans are heeding the call
of the new isolationism. And they are not alone; there is a tendency in
the whole Western world to turn inward, to become parochial and
isolationist—dangerously so. But there can be neither peace nor security
a generation hence unless we recognise now the massiveness of the
forces at work in Asia, where more than half the world's people
live and where the greatest explosive potential is lodged."
"One of the legacies of Vietnam almost certainly will be a deep
reluctance on the part of the United States to become involved once
again in a similar intervention on a similar basis. The war has imposed
severe strains on the United States, not only militarily and economically
but socially and politically as well. Bitter dissension has torn the fabric
of American intellectual life, and whatever the outcome of the war the
tear may be a long time mending."
"If another friendly country should be faced with an externally supported
communist insurrection . . . there is serious question whether the
American public or the American Congress would now support a unilateral
American intervention, even at the request of the host Government.
This makes it vitally in their own interest that the nations in the path
of China's ambitions move quickly to establish an indigenous Asian
framework for their own future security . . . The role of the United States
as world policeman is likely to be limited in the future."
"SEATO was useful and appropriate to its time, but it was Western in
origin and drew its strength from the United States and Europe . . . Asia
today needs its own security undertakings, reflecting the new realities
of Asian independence and Asian needs."
THE WAR in Vietnam has for so long
dominated our field of vision that it
has distorted our picture of Asia. A
small country on the rim of the con-
tinent has filled the screen of our
minds; but it does not fill the map.
Sometimes dramatically, but more often
quietly, the rest of Asia has been under-
going a profound, an exciting, and on
balance an extraordinarily promising
transformation. One key to this trans-
formation is the emergence of Asian
regionalism; another is the development
of a number of the Asian economies;
another is gathering disaffection with
all the old isms that have so long im-
prisoned so many minds and so many
Governments. By and large the non-
communist Asian Governments are
looking for solutions that work rather
than solutions that fit a preconceived
set of doctrines and dogmas.
Most of them also recognise a com-
mon danger, and see its source as
Peking. Taken together, these develop-
ments present an extraordinary set of
opportunities for a U.S. policy which
must begin to look beyond Vietnam.
In looking toward the future, however,
we should not ignore the vital role Viet-
nam has played in making these de-
velopments possible. Whatever one may
think of the “domino” theory, it is be-
yond question that without the Ameri-
can commitment in Vietnam Asia
would be a far different place today.
The U.S. presence has provided
tangible and highly visible proof that
Communism is not necessarily the wave
of Asia’s future. This was a vital factor
in the turnaround in Indonesia, where
a tendency toward fatalism is a
national characteristic. It provided a
shield behind which the anti-com-
munist forces found the courage and
the capacity to stage their counter-
coup and, at the final moment, to
rescue their country from the Chinese
orbit. And, with its 100 million people,
and its 3000-mile arc of islands con-
taining the region’s richest hoard of
natural resources, Indonesia constitutes
by far the greatest prize in the South-
East Asian area.
Beyond this, Vietnam has diverted
Peking from such other potential
targets as India, Thailand, and Mal-
aysia. It has bought vitally needed time
for Governments that were weak or


unstable or leaning toward Peking as
a hedge against the future—time which
has allowed them to attempt to cope
with their own insurrections while press-
ing ahead with their political, econ-
omic, and military development. From
Japan to India, Asian leaders know
why we are in Vietnam and, privately
if not publicly, they urge us to see it
through to a satisfactory conclusion.
Many argue that an Atlantic axis is
natural and necessary, but maintain, in
effect, that Kipling w'as right, and that
the Asian peoples are so “different” that
Asia itself is only peripherally an
American concern. This represents a
racial and cultural chauvinism that does
little credit to American ideals, and it
shows little appreciation either of the
westward thrust of American interests
or of the dynamics of world develop-
ment.
During the final third of the
twentieth century, Asia, not Europe or
Latin America, will pose the greatest
danger of a confrontation which could
escalate into World War 111. At the
same time, the fact that the United
States has now fought three Asian wars
In the space of a generation is grimly
but truly symbolic of the deepening in-
volvement of the United States in what
happens on the other side of the
Pacific which modern transportation
and communications have brought closer
to us today than Europe was in the
years immediately preceding World
War 11.
The United States is a Pacific power.
Europe has been withdrawing the rem-
nants of empire, but the United States,
with its coast reaching in an arc from
Mexico to the Bering Straits, is one
anchor of a vast Pacific community.
Both our interests and our ideals propel
us westward across the Pacific, not as
conquerors but as partners, linked by
the sea not only with those oriental
nations on Asia’s Pacific littoral but
at the same time with occidental Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, and with the
island nations between.
Since World War 11, a new Asia has
been emerging with startling rapidity;
indeed, Asia is changing more swiftly
than any other part of the world. All
around the rim of China nations are
becoming Western without ceasing to
be Asian.
The dominant development in Asia
immediately after World War II was
de-colonisation, with its admixture of
intense nationalism. But the old
nationalist slogans have less meaning
for today’s young than they had for
their fathers. Having never known a
“colonialist,” they find colonialists un-
convincing as scapegoats for the present
ills of their societies. If dissatisfied with
conditions as they see them, the young
tend to blame those now in power.
As the sharp anti-colonial focus blurs,
the old nationalism is evolving into a
more complex, multi-layered set of
concepts and attitudes. On the one hand
are a multitude of local and tribal
identifications the Montagnards in
Vietnam, the Han tribes in Burma,
the provincial and linguistic separatisms
that constantly claw at the fabric of
Indian unity. On the other hand, there
is a reaching-out by the governing
elites, and particularly the young, for
something larger, more like an Asian
regionalism.
The developing coherence of Asian
regional thinking is reflected in a dis-
position to consider problems and
loyalties in regional terms, and to evolve
regional approaches to development
needs and to the evolution of a new
world order. This is not excessively
chauvinistic, but rather in the nature
of a coalescing confidence, a recog-
nition that Asia can become a counter-
balance to the West, and an increasing
disposition to seek Asian solutions to
Asian problems through co-operative
action.
Along with the rising complex of
national, sub-regional, and regional
identification and pride, there is also an
acute sense of common danger a
factor which serves as catalyst to the
others. The common danger from com-
munist China is now in the process of
shifting the Asian Governments’ centre
of concern. During the colonial and
immediately post-colonial eras, Asians
stood opposed primarily to the West,
which represented the intruding alien
power. But now the West has aband-
oned its colonial role, and it no longer
threatens the independence of the Asian
nations. Red China, however, does, and
its threat is clear, present, and re-
peatedly and insistently expressed. The
message has not been lost on Asia’s
leaders. They recognise that the West,
and particularly the United States, now
represents not an oppressor but a pro-
tector. And they recognise their need
for protection.
This does not mean that the old
resentments and distrusts have vanished,
or that new ones will not arise. It does,
however, mean that there has been
an important shift in the balance of
their perceptions about the balance of
danger, and this shift has important im-
plications for the future.
One of the legacies of Vietnam al-
most certainly will be a deep reluctance
on the part of the United States to be-
come involved once again in a similar
intervention on a similar basis. The
war has imposed severe strains on the
United States, not only militarily and
economically but socially and politically
as well. Bitter dissension has torn the
fabric of American intellectual life, and
whatever the outcome of the war the
tear may be a long time mending. If
another friendly country should be
faced with an externally supported com-
munist insurrection whether in Asia,
or in Africa, or even Latin America—
there is serious question whether the
American public or the American Con-
gress would now support a unilateral
American intervention, even at the re-
quest of the host Government. This
makes it vitally in their own interest
that the nations in the path of China’s
ambitions move quickly to establish an
indigenous Asian framework for their
own future security.
In doing so, they need to fashion
arrangements able to deal both with
old-style wars and with new with
traditional wars, in which armies cross
over national boundaries, and with the
so-called “wars of national liberation,”
in which they burrow under national
boundaries.
I am not arguing that the day is
past when the United States would re-
spond militarily to communist threats
in the less stable parts of the world,
or that a unilateral response to a uni-
lateral request for help is out of the
question. But other nations must recog-
nise that the role of the United States
as world policeman is likely to be
limited in the future. To ensure that
a U.S. response will be forthcoming
if needed, machinery must be created
that is capable of meeting two condi-
tions: (a) a collective effort by the
nations of the region to contain the
threat by themselves; and, if that effort
fails, (b) a collective request to the
United States for assistance. This is
important not only from the respective
national standpoints, but also from the
standpoint of avoiding nuclear collision.
Nations not possessing great power
can indulge in the luxury of criticism
of others; those possessing it have the
responsibility of decision. Faced with
a clear challenge, the decision not to
use one’s power must be as deliberate
as the decision to use it. The con-
sequences can be fully as far-reaching
and fully as irrevocable.
If another world war is to be pre-
vented, every step possible must be
taken to avert direct confrontations
between the nuclear powers. To achieve
this, it is essential to minimise the
number of occasions on which the great
powers have to decide whether or not
to commit tljeir forces. These choices
cannot be eliminated, but they can be
reduced by the development of
regional defence pacts, in which nations
undertake, among themselves, to
attempt to contain aggression in their
own areas.
If the initial response to a threatened
aggression, of whichever type —whether
across the border or under it can be
made by lesser powers in the immediate
area and thus within the path of aggres-
sion, one of two things can be achieved:
either they can in fact contain it by
themselves, in which case the United
States is spared involvement and thus
the world is spared the consequences
of great-power action; or, if they can-
not, the ultimate choice can be pre-
sented to the United States in clear-
cut terms, by nations which would
automatically become allies in whatever
response might prove necessary. To put
it another way, the regional pact be-
comes a buffer separating the distant
great power from the immediate
threat. Only if the buffer proves in-
sufficient does the great power become
involved, and then in terms that make
victory more attainable and the enter-
prise more palatable.
This is particularly important when
the threat takes the form of an ex-
ternally supported guerilla action, as

The Unmarried
Mothers
By ROSEMARY KIELY
A YOUNG UNMARRIED mother kept
her baby in the back seat of a car for
four days after leaving hospital because
she had nowhere to live. In the same
State, but in a very different class, an-
other teenager became critically ill
after a late abortion. The schoolboy
father committed suicide. The girl is
alive, but sterile.
An unmarried epileptic woman last
year brought her fourth epileptic baby
to a social welfare department for
adoption. “I wish they could do some-
thing for me, to stop me having babies,”
she said. But they couldn’t. Sterilisation
is illegal except where pregnancy would
endanger the mother’s health.
A 32-year-old private secretary has
taken her small daughter to the creche,
or school, for seven years. She hopes
that nobody in the street where she
lives in her trim maisonette knows that
she has never been married. A 21-year-
old woman, overwhelmed with the prob-
lems of living, has finally given up her
small son after a four-year battle to
keep him, which included two years in
creches and foster homes.
In Melbourne, two doctors facing
abortion charges have been acquitted
by a jury after three women told the
court that these doctors had procured
their abortions.
A Greek kitchen maid gave birth to
her baby unaided, and its body was
found in a Canberra park with a scarf
wound around its neck. The judge,
putting her on a good behaviour bond,
said, “This woman has suffered in a
way no woman ought to suffer in a
civilised community.”
The community, from Government
down to the neighbors, casts a blanket
of indifference and intolerance over
the problems of the unmarried mother
and her child. This blanket is only
occasionally lifted by compassion, like
the judge’s, and then it is often too
late to save either.
The Press regularly runs articles on
unmarried mothers, but most of the
discussion centres on the decline of
Christian morality, the growing wicked-
ness of the young, and abortion. Apart
from a request by a woman Senator for
a committee to look into the problem
of pregnancy among young girls, noth-
ing has been done.
One in every 16 babies in Australia
is born illegitimate, and one in three
unwed mothers rears her babies. The
number of illegitimate births 15,531
in 1965 continues to rise although
the live births total has been falling
since 1961. The illegitimate percentage
of total births is higher than ever be-
fore in the history of the Common-
wealth. This figure declined from 6.2
percent in 1900 to 3.8 percent in 1940-
41. It has been rising steadily for the
past 15 years, to 6.7 percent in 1965.
The census figures for 1966 are ex-
pected to continue this trend.
Most of the increase comes from
the young. This is due only in part to
the increase in the number of teenagers
born immediately after the war. The
rate of illegitimate births to girls aged
15-19 went from 1 to every 104 in
1963 to 1 to every 85 in 1965. In
contrast, the number of babies born to
unmarried women over 30 years of age
declined between 1963 and 1965, per-
haps due to the influence of the Pill.
The experiences of unmarried
mothers vary as widely as their person-
alities and circumstances. They come
from diverse cultural, social, and eco-
nomic backgrounds, but there are dis-
tinct types, with separate problems.
Many are fortuitous unmarried mothers,
according to Miss Esther Phillips, the
social worker in charge of adoption and
foster care in Victoria.
Miss Phillips says such girls are often
young. They tell her they didn’t use
contraceptives because they didn’t ex-
pect to need them when they went out
that night. They think in no terms but
adoption and usually don’t repeat their
mistake. The pregnancy and subsequent
signing of adoption papers may be a
personal ordeal for these girls, but
their practical difficulties are compara-
tively easily solved.
Most keep their pregnancies secret,
and spend the time away from home.
Those who book early enough go to
maternity homes, where they can afford
to live on the Commonwealth unem-
ployment benefit which is paid as an
unofficial “pension” to any unmarried
mother-to-be who produces a medical
certificate.
One of these, Kedesh, run by the
Anglican Church on the banks of the
Yarra, in Kew, Victoria, looks more
like a modern cream brick boarding
school than a home for unmarried
mothers. The boarding school impres-
sion is strengthened by the pleasant,
though disciplined, air of the place,
the little chapel, and the laughter in
the corridors. Kedesh girls receive in-
struction in housework and cookery,
and last year four sat for public ex-
aminations. Nearly all are young and
have their babies adopted. There is no
absolute rule on this, as Kedesh’s
Matron Stephens says, but social work-
ers do not send to Kedesh those girls
who want to keep their babies.
No girl is allowed back to Kedesh
for a second birth. As Matron Stephens
says, “Kedesh is quite the nicest home
for unmarried mothers in Melbourne.”
For the girls who want to keep their
babies there are other homes, but they
are grimmer in appearance.
Already, a third of unmarried
mothers rear their own babies. Research
evidence suggests that this is a grow-
ing trend, despite the practical diffi-
culties and prejudice faced by these
mothers, and the near-unanimous advice
against it of counselling social workers.
They have to be breadwinners as well
as mothers to their babies. They do
not even receive the breadline widow’s
pension, which goes to every other
mother bringing up children without
paternal support.
They may claim confinement ex-
penses, maintenance, and medical ex-
penses from the fathers, but few do.
Some are reluctant to humiliate the
fathers with a court action which may
also embarrass themselves, or they may
be, as a Law Department official sug-
gested, unaware of their own rights.
They are entitled to claim certain
fringe benefits from time to time, but
these are so deviously concealed that
few unmarried mothers have the time
or resourcefulness to seek them out.
The Commonwealth Government
provides a special benefit (worth $8.25
about half the base rate widow’s
pension), from six weeks before to six
weeks after the birth, and in certain
other cases of need, each being decided
on its merits. A mother whose de-facto
husband deserts her after three years
may get it, but if she is deserted after
six months, or before the baby is born,
she may not. One unmarried mother

child for a short while went to inquire
about this and was told, “If you had
two babies we might be able to help
you.”
There is the usual maternity allow-
ance and child endowment, and an
unwed mother who is insured with a
hospital benefits organisation may re-
ceive half the normal benefit for con-
finement expenses.
There is unemployment benefit for
the unemployed; sickness benefit for a
mother who is sick or breastfeeding or
has a sick child. Most State welfare
departments pay small amounts of aid
in special emergencies, and contribute
to medical, dental, hospital, food, and
clothing bills for the children. In some
States, voluntary agencies take care of
gaps in these services. But none of
this aid is enough to live on.
To rear her baby, an unmarried
mother needs an above-average (or
live-in) job, good health, stamina, and
a special brand of endurance. “You
have to be pretty brave to walk out in
the street with a baby in a pram,” said
the almoner of a city hospital.
Illegitimacy is not always and every-
where a problem. The existence or
absence of a problem depends on the
community’s response to the out-of-
wedlock child. In parts of South
America, where the illegitimacy rate
reaches 70 percent, illegitimacy is of
course accepted.
Even in Australia there is more tol-
erance in those outback parts of
Queensland, Western Australia, New
South Wales, and the Northern Terri-
tory, where from 10 percent to 34 per-
cent of babies are born illegitimate,
than in the major cities (from Mel-
bourne’s 5.84 percent to Brisbane’s 8.59
percent) and more closely settled coun-
try districts (in Victoria, under 3 per-
cent). One unmarried mother who
went to a hospital in Northern Queens-
land to have her baby told me she was
relieved to find she was not regarded
as a freak. Three of the six unmarried
nurses on the staff also had babies, at
home, being minded by their mothers
while they worked.
The Anglo-Saxon attitude to illegiti-
macy dates back to the sixteenth cen-
tury when it became compulsory to
celebrate marriage in church. At this
time, too, Henry VIII was breaking
up the great religious estates, and the
orders could no longer care for found-
lings. This duty now fell upon the
parish, and ultimately the parishioner.
Illegitimacy became “an offence against
God’s and Man’s laws” and an affront
to the pocket, too.
This led to the first of a succession
of harsh Bastardy Laws, which
stretched oppressively over four cen-
turies. A law of 1610 stated that
“every lewd woman who shall have a
bastard which may be chargeable to
the parish shall be committed to the
House of Correction for one year.” A
repeat of the crime brought life
imprisonment. Infanticide became
common.
The unmarried father could be
flogged, jailed, or brought to church in
handcuffs to marry the mother of his
child. The child had no legal rights
or claims on its father or mother; legally
it was filius nullius —nobody’s child. By
Victoria’s reign, the punishment for
the unmarried mother was to deprive
her of her child, if she did not prefer
to live with it in the workhouse.
The first glimmer of change came in
the late Victorian era, when Josephine
Butler pioneered the policy of helping
the illegitimate child by helping his
mother to keep him. By her death, in
1906, a strong Anglican Moral Welfare
movement had formed around this
policy and it began to be adopted by
the British Government 12 years later.
Labor and Women’s Rights move-
ments were bringing change to the posi-
tion of the unmarried mother and her
child in Scandinavia. In Norway, 1915,
the Minister of Justice, Johan Castberg,
introducing the Children’s Rights Laws,
said that the present arrangement
(which was principally the same as ours
now) was a “repudiation of the demand
for civil liberty and for the equal rights
and duties of man and woman.”
The legislation gave the natural child
and its mother the right to the father’s
support, according to his social posi-
tion and means, and the State the
duty of trying to establish paternity in
all cases.
There has been no Castberg or Jose-
phine Butler working for this tolerant
approach in Australia or America, and
consequently the unmarried mother and
her child are less acceptable to these
societies. In both countries, the emphasis
has shifted solidly to a policy of adop-
tion in the best interests of the child.
In America this was a result of a
number of studies which showed that
“the girl who has a socially unaccept-
able illegitimate baby often comes from
an unsatisfactory family background
and has developed a neurotic character,
the illegitimate baby being in the nature
of a symptom of her psychological ill-
health.”
The most influential of these was an
impressionistic study published in 1954
by Leontine Young, Professor of Case-
work at Ohio State University. Miss
Young maintains that in America almost
all unmarried mothers are motivated
by self-punishment. They become preg-
nant because of the penalties involved,
though they may not be aware of their
purpose. Their neuroses began in a
childhood hopelessly dominated by one
parent to the exclusion of the other.
The mother-ridden girls are not pro-
miscuous, nor do they care for their
baby’s father. They deny responsibility
for the conception, fail to use contra-
ceptives, and want to take the baby
home to mother. They have never been
allowed to escape from a state of in-
fantile dependence, Miss Young says,
and in having an illegitimate baby their
unconscious purpose is the fulfilment
of the pre-oedipal fantasy of having a
child by (and for) the mother.
The father-dominated girls seek out
masochistic relationships with men, and
use the baby as a weapon of vengeance
against their own fathers or the babies’
fathers, or both. Unmarried mothers,
therefore, are neurotically incapable of
giving their babies the loving care they
need and should be encouraged to have
them adopted.
Miss Young makes no claims for her
sweeping thesis beyond the taboo-ridden
American social milieu. Healthier
societies give rise to a lower proportion
of neurotics among unmarried mothers,
she says.
Yet, for hard-working Australian
social workers, with no time for their
own research, Leontine Young’s work
has added a weighty new reason to the
case for adoption. Her plea for under-
standing for the unwed mother who-
does keep her child has been largely
ignored.
An up-to-date Australian survey tells
a different story. Mr. Wilfred Jarvis,
a clinical psychologist and lecturer at
the University of New South Wales,
has found from 15 years of research
that unmarried mothers are not more
likely to be psychologically disturbed
than is a random selection of unmar-
ried girls.
He excepts an identifiable group
who “deliberately and consciously
attempt to become pregnant in the hope
that this will solve some of their diffi-
culties. In the majority of cases, girls
motivated in this way are suffering
significant psychological disturbances.”'
In addition, Mr. Jarvis says he is
satisfied that “girls who have endured
unsatisfactory relationships with their
parents and particularly those whose
relationships with father have been seri-
ously impaired —have a greater statisti-
cal likelihood of becoming unmarried
mothers than do girls who have estab-
lished and maintained rewarding and
mutually supporting relationships with
parents.”
The dynamics of this, he says, are
complicated. “For example, with girls
in the early teen years, unsatisfactory
relationships with father during in-
fancy are frequently displayed in strong
attachments to males older than them-
selves during early adolescence. Such
relationships may end in pregnancy
simply because the lass is hopelessly
ignorant about the mechanisms of re-
production and the male is careless or
maybe also ignorant.”
Mr. Jarvis says that present pro-
visions for unmarried mothers are very
inadequate. “Society forgets the prob-
lem after the child is born; yet some
of the most unpleasant aspects of the
total problem begin to develop at that
time.” The pregnancy is a difficult
period for most girls and a stressful
one for their families. But during preg-
nancy, the unmarried mother is pro-
tected by “certain biological defence
mechanisms, which seem to make the
mother less vulnerable to psychological

stress than she normally is.” She also
has the shelter of the maternity home.
“Their most serious traumas occur
after their confinement, when they
return to their own world.” This is
true, Mr. Jarvis says, of the neurotic
and the normal, whether or not they
keep the child. The nature of post-
confinement stresses is determined by
such factors as the accumulated psycho-
logical resources of the girl, the degree
of support of her family and friends,
and perhaps most importantly, Mr.
Jarvis says, by the decision she reached
concerning the destiny of her child,
and the ways in which these decisions
were arrived at.
“I have concluded that the decision
the girl makes about the future of her
child is one of the most complex and
significant decisions she will ever
make,” says Mr. Jarvis. “Normally the
girl is bombarded with advice usu-
ally ‘You should adopt the child for
its own sake.’ The maternity home can
also be a powerful factor. Some re-
quire her to sign a document declaring
that she will have the child adopted
before she is admitted; others permit
considerable freedom of choice.
“It is impossible for her to know, at
the time, that the emotional conse-
quences of the decision will be flour-
ishing within her permanently.”
Mr. Jarvis is now studying the con-
sequences of this decision, for mother
and child, about 15 years later. He
has found that “Mothers who surrender
their children for adoption seem to
suffer chronic bereavement for the rest
of their lives. And, as if to complement
this, adopted children usually manifest
a keen and often obsessional wish to
locate and meet their natural mothers,
which becomes dominant during ado-
lescence.”
He has found that unmarried fathers
also suffer bereavement and guilt long
after the child is born and adopted,
although most have by then terminated
their relationship with the mother.
The unusual scope of this study, com-
bining the depth of individual psycho-
diagnostic examinations with a wide
statistical sampling, means that it is a
long time before anything is published.
Already Mr. Jarvis has been studying
this phenomenon for 15 years. Publica-
tion of his work should promote under-
standing among the public, the policy
makers in government, and social
workers in the field.
Meanwhile, public tolerance is in-
creasing and unmarried mothers rarely
meet the overt hostility that was once
considered a part of their punishment.
But still the basic problem remains— ■
for between the family, which is shocked
and ashamed, the friends who do not
speak, and the acquaintances who gossip,
the unmarried mother still has to battle
for the self-respect she needs if her
future is to be worth while for her baby
or herself.
Hand in hand with the need for
acceptance is the need for economic
security. This can be provided by the
State taking the initiative in securing
maintenance from the putative father,
as in Scandinavia, and the payment of a
pension, with means test. This reform
is, to say the least, unlikely to come
from the present Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, with its laissez-faire approach
to social services.
It is further obstructed by attitudes
like that of the departmental social
worker who told me that this “might
create a situation where girls are going
to say ‘all I need to do is have a child
and I can get a pension.’ ” There is
no evidence that reform leads to increas-
ing illegitimacy. Norway, in contrast
to its neighbor Sweden, has one of the
lower illegitimacy rates in Europe, and
Sweden’s was even higher before the
reforms were introduced.
But reform requires action. And who
is to act? In other countries social
workers have built organisations to work
for reform. The National Council for
the Unmarried Mother and her Child
in Britain also does casework, helps in
affiliation cases, and exercises a co-
ordinating role in national policy. In
Sweden, a voluntary society built a
block of flats for unmarried mothers,
and Maternity Aid, in Denmark, pro-
vides grants of money and flat accom-
modation for mothers taking courses of
training.
In contrast, most Australian social
workers seem to be satisfied that in im-
proving adoption facilities they are
doing enough for unmarried mothers.
Of course there are exceptions, such
as the farsighted hospital almoner who
saw that eventually unmarried mothers
would be accepted as a normal element
in society in the same way as adop-
tion, once regarded as “taking on other
people’s trouble,” has become accepted.
However, she did not want to be quoted
by name.
In Mr. Jarvis’ words, society seems
implicitly to say -- “Well, if you keep
your child you had better not expect
any help from us; for we believe that
you should surrender your child.”
A Victorian social worker (male)
says that one factor retarding com-
munity help for unmarried mothers is
other women. Until recently there has
been among Australian women a tradi-
tion of conformist stay-at-home-with-
the-housework mediocrity. It has made
the hearth, in many older homes, a
bastion of prejudice.
The Australian Association of Social
Workers has no policy on the prob-
lems of unmarried mothers, and the
head of a church social welfare mission
told me that he couldn’t remember any
proposal to help unmarried mothers
being discussed at any social welfare
conference he had attended.
Even deserted wives who run their
own self-help organisation named (or
misnamed) the Supporting Mothers’
Association in Victoria and South Aus-
tralia have refused to allow unmarried
mothers to be members. “It’s a question
of social status,” said the association’s
Methodist chaplain, Rev. Frank Hartley,
who, nevertheless, would like to start
a similar group for unmarried mothers.

N.S.W. OBSCENITY LEGISLATION
Its a Trash Bill not a Posh Bill
IN THE SOMETIMES florid debates
about the new- Bill to amend the N.S.W.
Obscene and Indecent Publications Act,
it is as well to remember that the Bill
only changes the position of literary
and artistic w-orks in two ways, both
of them for the better, and that some
of the more important “debates” on
the Act are still going on in the Court
of Appeal or High Court and will not
be affected by the Bill, anyhow
especially on the meaning of
“indecency,” on the issue w-hether a dis-
play is “publication,” and in the issue
whether “undue emphasis on sex, etc.,”
in any w-ay extends the established
test of obscenity. Basically the new- Bill
is a Trash Bill, not a Posh Bill.
As far as literary or artistic works
are concerned, the Bill makes two
obviously progressive amendments.
First, it allows trial by jury of any
person charged w-ith an indictable
offence under the Act. In recent years
decisions on literary works, paintings,
or sculpture have been made by magis-
trates, and, while some decisions have
been enlightened, many have not been.
Juries are not necessarily enlightened
(for example, it w-as a jury- that found
Robert Close, author of “Love Me
Sailor,” guilty), but a writer, artist, or
painter will almost always prefer a jury
to a magistrate.
Secondly, the Bill will change that
part of the Act which gives immunity
to a literary, artistic, or scientific work,
unless, despite its merit, the Court is
satisfied that the method of distribu-
tion or exhibition was not justified in
the circumstances (for example, an
exhibition of meritorious but indecent
paintings to all and sundry, including
children). As the Act stands, the pub-
lisher, distributor, exhibitor has to
prove his method of distribution was
justified. The Bill will place the onus
on the prosecution of proving that the
circumstances do not justify the method
of publication and it will have to
prove this beyond reasonable doubt.
This issue arose most recently over an
exhibition of Michael Brown’s satirical
pop paintings and is now settled in the
artists’-writers’-publishers’ favor.
The Bill also allows for uniformity
between the Federal and State authori-
ties on censorship decisions. More has
been made of this than the Bill justifies.
In fact the relevant legislation will be
almost entirely Federal, and the N.S.W.
Bill merely refers to the new National
Literature Board of Review—a division
of w-hich (five members) will replace
the present (Federal) Literature Cen-
sorship Board and the full Board of
which (nine members) will replace the
present Appeal Board—and protects its
members from civil litigation arising
out of its decisions. Three of the
Board’s members will be selected from
a joint-State panel and the other six
will be Federal appointees. The idea be-
hind this is purely administrative: it is
understood (but not allowed for in any
Act) that neither the States nor the
Federal authorities will take action over
any book which the Board advises may
be imported or published in Australia.
This should remove the anomaly of,
for example, Victoria taking action
against Mary McCarthy’s “The Group,”
which the Federal authorities had
allowed into the country and which
other States refused to “ban.” How this
will work depends on how and why the
Board makes its decisions. Disunity has
the advantage that it makes reactionary-
censorship look silly; and uniformity
involves the risk of a narrow- uni-
formity. But the new- arrangements
also mean that the less enlightened
authorities will be outvoted. The
Federal authorities have the upper hand
on the Board, and their enlightenment
is shown by- the fact that the Council
for Civil Liberties cannot at the moment
find one banned book that is worth
going to court over. (Even “The Ginger
Man” was released the other day. If
some other one turns up and is pub-
lished in an Australian edition, as in the
case of “The Trial of Lady Chatterley,”
it will, if prosecuted, be able to have
a jury trial under the amended Act.)
The most far-reaching provisions of
the Bill, how-ever, are the introduction
of the category of “restricted” (not
banned) publications, and the estab-
lishing of a State Advisory Committee
on Publications. The Committee will
have, in fact, three jobs altogether.
It will refer locally published books of
literary merit to the National Board
for advice. It will also advise authors
of popular unpretentious works, who
may choose to seek such advice,
w-hether or not their work will be
liable, if published, to be the subject
of proceedings: a clearance from the
Committee w r ill provide immunity from

prosecution. Pop writers and pub-
lishers need not seek such a clearance
nor accept the advice.
But the third function is the most
controversial. The Committee will
advise the Chief Secretary whether a
publication is unsuitable for children
under 16 because of its indecency or
heavy emphasis on cruelty, drug addic-
tion, sex, and so on. If it is deemed
unsuitable its sale will be restricted.
(The Committee is, unlike the Queens-
land and Tasmanian Boards, not con-
cerned with outright prohibitions.) A
“restricted” publication may still be
sold in shops, but it may not be sold
by street pedlars nor advertised on
posters nor displayed in shop windows
and doorways. An offence by a com-
pany involves a fine of up to $250 for
the first offence, and one by an indi-
vidual a fine of up to $125 or up
to three months’ jail. The Bill also
aims at restricting not only one issue
but future issues; and not only one
magazine but a “class of publication.”
This is aimed at the current crop of
smut magazines, whose publishers have
found a way of surviving, without
advertising revenue, for longer than
their ancestors did throughout the past
100 years that is, by recruiting
armies of beatniks to peddle the publi-
cations in the streets. If you agree
special action should be taken against
them (and it may be that heavy liti-
gation costs would shortly knock most
of them over, anyhow), it is difficult
to see how any other kind of legisla-
tion could catch them. To prosecute
over one issue for obscenity takes time,
leaves “future” issues untouched, and
may fail they are often not obscene
in the classic sense; to knock over one
magazine and not a “class” would
leave the publisher free to change his
magazine’s name and carry on.
It is clear, however, that the Minis-
ter will now have a “dragnet” power
over “future issues” and “classes of
publication” and the dealers face more
simply proven charges than the com-
paratively difficult-to-prove one of
publishing an obscene work. Few people
are particularly concerned about the
fate of the magazines aimed at; the
■controversy is about the possible abuse
of the “dragnet” power and its possible
use against satirical magazines such as
“Oz.” (Not that it is much good, but it
would be a pity to see it knocked over
as a result of restrictions on its methods
of sale.) I personally believe the power
will not be abused any more than the
old-established “dragnet” power to
close down stage shows is abused. But
although “dragnet” powers are always
undesirable, critics of this aspect of
the Bill, who agree that some action
is desirable, can try to think of a
more suitable technique.


OVERSEAS
Things are looking blacker
in the White House
IN ONE OF THE largest hotel ball-
rooms in Washington on Friday,
October 6, the Democratic National
Committee held a dinner-dance in
honor of President and Mrs. Johnson.
It was no secret that tickets had not
exactly sold like hot cakes.
Part of the reason for this may lie
in their price $lOOO is a lot of
money to pay for the privilege of eating
the usual hotel food even in the grand-
est company. But another reason may
lie in the title the occasion was given
as long ago as last July: “A Salute to
the President.” That in itself may ex-
plain why so many of the invitations
went straight into the dustbin.
Virtually all those who keep watch
on U.S. politics are agreed on one
fact: that there has never been a time
when quite such a startling lack of
confidence and trust has existed between
the American people and their Presi-
dent. Mr. Johnson’s personal predica-
ment could scarcely have been more
harshly revealed than it was the other
day when a Gallup Poll came up
with the news that if an election were
held tomorrow the for-the-moment
purely national Republican ticket of
Governors Rockefeller and Reagan
would swamp the incumbent President
and Vice-President by a margin of 57
to 43 percentage points.
Almost simultaneously, another poll
announced that, given the choice, even
Democratic voters by an easy majority
would prefer to see Robert Kennedy at
the White House rather than Mr.
Johnson.
Among seasoned veterans of the
political wars there has always been a
tendency to be sceptical of sudden
revelations such as these. One of the
weaknesses of polls is that they can-
not help dealing in what is essentially
a world of unreality. An election is
not going to be held tomorrow, nor
are Democrats ever likely to be offered
a straight choice between LBJ and
Bobby Kennedy. It is at least partly
for reasons of this nature that the pre-
vailing balance of expert opinion still
believes that in the end Mr. Johnson
will somehow succeed in getting him-
self re-elected next year.
Could it be, however, that all the
prophets and the pundits are being very
blind—that the writing is there on the
wall and that they are simply refusing
to read it? Certainly the present politi-
cal mood of the American nation is a
strange and curious one; and it is at
least arguable that beneath it personal
decisions have already been taken that
can only publicly be registered when
the time comes to pull the levers in the
polling booths 13 months from now.
For one thing, of course, singles out
LBJ from any of his predecessors in the
White House. In his more maudlin
moments he is said to enjoy picturing
himself as the most vilified President
in American history. It is not true;
equally bad, if not worse, things were
said in their time of office about his
three immediate Democratic predeces-
sors, Roosevelt, Truman, and even
Kennedy. What, however, does dis-
tinguish Mr. Johnson is the striking
absence in his case of that counter-
balancing battery of admiration and
even affection that most Presidents can
count on in time of trouble.
It is this factor that tends to get
ignored in most of the analysis now
going on about the President’s re-
election prospects. Superficially 1948,
when Truman dug himself out of, if
anything, bigger trouble than Mr. John-
son is in today, has all the appearance
of being the exact historical equivalent
for the President’s current political pre-
dicament.
But those who advance the theory
(and they include members of the
White House staff who, from time to
time, produce for the President’s en-
encouragement papers comparing his
Johnson’s Tax Bill was blocked last week by Congress ... “success deserting him”
electoral situation with that of Truman
before he defeated Dewey) naturally
have difficulty in facing up to the
central issue. In 1948 the bulk of the
American electorate came to see in
Harry Truman a gutsy little guy
battling all on his own against tre-
mendous odds. However badly the
opinion polls go for LBJ between now
and next year’s election, it is hard
to imagine him managing to create
that kind of impression in anyone’s

From the beginning his entire politi-
cal career has, in fact, been based on
one simple pattern justification by
success. And it is because success
even on the mundane level of getting
his own legislation through (as witness
last week’s blocking by Congress of his
Tax Bill) —is now deserting him that
he has come to look so unexpectedly a
vulnerable figure. Nor have his public
reactions to adversity done much to
help.
Britain and the EEC
The Pound barrier
THE MOST IMPORTANT aspect of
the Common Market Commission’s re-
port on Britain’s application to join
the Six is the doubt it casts on British
ability to reconcile membership with
the maintenance of the Pound’s present
exchange rate.
The report is sympathetic to the
application; it sees no barriers that
cannot be surmounted, if the British
Government really wants to join and if
the present members show a reasonable

degree of goodwill. It also sees con-
siderable benefit to the Community
from British membership—notably from
the very large British investment in
scientific and technological research.
Nevertheless, the section on sterling and
the strength of the British economy
coolly and diplomatically raise a
fundamental problem. Put bluntly,
the chances of maintaining the present
exchange rate and becoming a full
member of the European Economic
Community in the foreseeable future —
say, the next five years —are extremely
slender.
There can be no question that the
Commission’s analysis of the sterling
problem is fair-minded and based on
good economics. The basic arithmetic
of the immediate effects of full mem-
bership of the Community on the
British balance of payments is broadly
agreed: it would probably be £5OO
million a year worse than now. This
is mainly because of the Community’s
agricultural rules and its px-ovisibns for
free capital movements.
An additional £5OO million a year
is an alarming figure in relation to
British balance-of-payments experience
in recent years. Since another payment
deficit is expected this year, this means
that for the fifth year in succession
Britain is failing to pay its way in
the world, in spite of the imposition of
restrictive policies throughout the past
three years. Nor is there any reason to
be confident that Britain will turn the
corner into a payments surplus in 1968.
If. the latest National Institute figures
are adjusted in the light of current
knowledge and the prospect that output
will rise 3 percent next year, the out-
come is that in 1968 Britain is likely
to mark up yet another deficit.
So long as Britain continues to ac-
cept 500,000-750,000 unemployed and
does not take on any of the obligations
of membership of the Community, it
can struggle along. If pushed, it could
cover its deficit and repay some of
its debt by using up the rest of the
official holdings of dollar securities and
then conscript some of its privately
held overseas assets. But this still leaves
the question is there any hope of
achieving the massive improvement
needed to produce a surplus sufficient
to repay debts out of income and
absorb the cost of joining the Six?
The Government pins its hopes on
two things. One is to slow down infla-
tion to the level of competitors: but,
unfortunately, they show a remarkable
reluctance to let their inflations run
faster than Britain’s. The other is to
make productivity grow faster, which
most people seem to believe will auto-
matically strengthen the balance of pay-
ments. But, unhappily, this piece of
conventional wisdom has no obvious
justification. Faster productivity growth
means fast rises in real income. In
itself this is fine but it also implies
a faster rise in demand for imports,
which tends to make the balance of
payments worse.
The grave doubts about sterling in
the Commission’s report are reinforced
by fears about additional strains arising
from sterling’s role as an international
currency. Such fears lead to alarmingly
heavy speculative pressure against the
Pound when it is weak.
The Six do not want a newcomer
whose balance of payments has little
chance of standing up to the respon-
sibilities of membership. None of them
can forget that France was in a similar
position when the Rome Treaty was
signed and put things right almost
overnight by a combination of firm
domestic economic policies and a well-
timed change in the exchange rate.
Macao
Marriage of mammon and Mao
By DENNIS BLOODWORTH
THE HYDROFOIL subsides into the
water at the Macao Pier after smash-
ing its way aggressively across the 40
miles of choppy island-studded sea from
Hong Kong. But the split second of
silence that follows is at once broken
by a heavenly chorus in the Chinese
idiom. The radio station of this tiny
Portuguese overseas province on the lip
of Communist China is broadcasting
“The East Is Red ”
And so is Macao, it seems. For 410
years Lisbon has lorded over these six
square miles of colonial dependency
10,000 miles from home, embellishing
them with numerous ornate churches,
with balconied stucco villas, and with
fine pink palaces in the Iberian style
to house the Governor and give him
office space.
Last week the town was a riot of
red. Red triumphal arches straddled the
streets, on rooftops fields of red flags
fluttered in the light breeze, and a
thousand small hands clutched the
red breviary of Mao Tse Tung’s
thoughts as a long, neatly dressed file
of schoolchildren queued to see the red
exhibition in the Chinese Chamber of
Commerce, headquarters of the com-
munist movement in Macao,
For this enclave of 300,000 souls,
only 6000 of them holding Portuguese
papers, now serves two masters—one
in the big pink palace, the other in a
little red book.
The closed British Consulate and
Consular Residence are plastered with
defamatory slogans. No one removes
them. The Left Wing is a law unto
itself.
Yet the triumphal arches celebrating
the October 1 anniversary of the
Chinese People’s Republic were later

stripped of their Maoist’s slogans to
make way for October 5, Portugal’s
national day. By agreement, the Chinese
effaced themselves and allowed the
Portuguese flag to fly. China does not at
this stage want to take over Macao, for
this might provoke a startled flight of
business from Hong Kong, its main
source of foreign exchange. Portugal
does not intend to scuttle Macao, be-
cause this would encourage the rebels
in its African territories. There are
signs, therefore, that the sane on both
sides are ready for a modus vivendi, and
to buy time by blandly accepting
Macao’s many incongruities.
The offices of the communist-
directed Macao “Daily News” are
draped with eulogies of Chairman Mao,
whose moralistic teachings denounce
gain and exploitation and advocate
continence. But just a step farther along
the waterfront the rattle of chips in
Macao’s gaudy floating casino is chal-
lenged by the hammering of carpen-
ters, who are adapting its nightclub
stage for a forthcoming Japanese nude
show. Chinese Leftists, aware of the
austere conditions of life just across the
border in Mao Tse Tung’s homeland,
nevertheless breathe with a certain
equanimity the dubious air of this gross
tourists’ paradise, with its dog-racing, its
annual bullfights and grand prix, its
gambling and karting. Macao’s
principal income is derived from the
operation of two wealthy syndicates
one for gaming and one for gold, both
of which run hydrofoil services to bring
in the other main economic attraction,
the holidaymaker from Hong Kong.
One has a sense of uneasy, almost
blind, compromise. The compromise
whether the marriage of mammon and
Mao, or the live-and-let-live policy of
Chinese Left-wing moderates is per-
sonified by the popular and philan-
thropic Mr. Ho Yin. Ho Yin is a mil-
lionaire member of the gold syndicate,
a proprietor of bus and taxi companies
The British Consulate in Macao, still closed and plastered with slogans
and cinemas, whose name also figures
on the boards of banks. But he is also
chairman of the Left-wing Chinese
Chamber of Commerce, member of the
People’s Political Consultative Confer-
ence in Peking (as well as of Macao’s
Legislative Council), holds both Portu-
guese and Chinese passports, and is
China’s principal representative in the
province.
But the current ascendancy of the
Ho Yins, with their pragmatic common-
sense outlook, may not be permanently
established over the more fanatical
leadership of the communist-led trade
unions. Everything depends on events
in China, and it may not be possible
to hold down Macao’s militant teachers
and students if the cultural revolution
regains momentum. Many fear renewed
violence on December 3, anniversary of
the bloodshed last year.
For the moment, however, the
Chinese seem satisfied with their de-
struction of Portuguese political
authority, and a split-level solution in
Macao “City of the Name of God”.
appears to suit all parties. For the
vast majority are tax-paying Chinese

Salazar’s and unto Mao that which is
Mao’s.

up the shutters in Canberra and re-
turned home, but possibly a third and
less obvious explanation' is the truer
one.
On the surface, the rift in Austra-
lia’s valued amity with Cambodia was
hastened by Prince Norodom Sihanouk’s
letter last month to the Melbourne
University Labor Club, giving the
address of the Cambodian-based repre-
sentatives of Vietnam’s National
Liberation Front, and by the Australian
Government’s “disappointment” over
the letter.
But even before the row about
attempts to send aid from Australia to
the NLF, there was the publicised sen-
sitivity of Cambodia’s Head of State
about his country’s frontiers. Australia’s
disappointment over the letter was
matched in July by Prince Sihanouk’s
“regret” that Australia was only able
to “respect” Cambodia’s territorial in-
tegrity within its borders and stopped
short of actual recognition of the fron-
tiers. This alone might seem to have
been a vexed enough issue to start the
freeze.
But some Far Eastern observers are
now speculating that the NLF issue,
and Australia’s fence-sitting on Cam-
bodia’s frontier dispute with Thailand,
South Vietnam, and Laos, couldn’t have
been better timed for Sihanouk’s pres-
ent strategy, that under the cover of
resentment he has been able to retreat
from an uncomfortably close link with
a pro-Western country at a time when
new tensions have shown up between
Cambodia and China, formerly his No.
1 friend.
The trouble Cambodia has been
having with its local Communists, the
dismissal of Left-wing Cabinet Minis-
ters, and closure of communist news-
papers in Phnom Penh have taken the
gloss off Sino-Cambodian cameraderie,
something of far more concern than a
falling out with distant Canberra. A
practised tightrope walker between
East and West in recent years, Sihanouk
sees neutralism as the only hope of his
hemmed-in kingdom. He would not
want any coolness with China, still his
most important ally, to be exacerbated
by friendship with the West, and Aus-
tralia had been one of his few Western
friends.
Canberra is without a Cambodian
mission, but Peking isn’t. When China,
like Australia, announced its “respect”
for Cambodian territorial integrity,
Sihanouk was going to bring his man
in Peking home, too. But after a mes-
sage from Chou En Lai last month he
changed his mind, announcing that
Peking’s declaration implied full recog-
nition of the boundaries.
The Australian Ambassador, Mr.
Noel Deschamps, is still in Phnom
Penh, no doubt working quietly to
restore a mutual regard that took 15
years to build up. But, Viet Cong aid,
boundaries, and even Canberra stone-
throwing notwithstanding, it seems
likely Australia’s special brand of mate-
ship with Cambodia foundered on sub-
merged hazards, pot the surface ones.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The Australian National Line in
the overseas league
THE GOOD NEWS about the Govern-
ment allowing the Australian National
Line to enter the tough arena of over-
seas trading nevertheless brings with it
some problems. If the ANL is admitted
to the Northbound conference to
Japan (and it would be unthinkable
that it would not be) then there will
be a public measuring stick available
of the profitability of this run now
Australia’s biggest export route. This
means that if the ANL, because of its
higher crew rates, finds it cannot make
money out of the route and if the con-
ference sticks to its generally alleged
principle of setting its freight rates
to suit its weakest member, then the
cost of exporting goods to Japan could
rise as a result of the ANL’s joining
the conference. The alternative is that
the ANL could not seek a freight rise,
but could instead ask the Government
for a subsidy on its Japanese operation;
this would give the other conference
members strong ammunition for freight
rises anyway.
So it is vital that the ANL do well
in this export trade; and the chances
are that it will. True, crewing costs in
Australia are far higher than elsewhere,
but with the sort of highly auomated
ships that the ANL would run on this
route (it has sought Government ap-
proval to have some roll-on, roll-offs
and container ships built), these are
only a small proportion of operating
costs. It is still vital for Australia’s
best interests that the Seamen’s Union
adopt a co-operative attitude to this
venture. In any event, the ANL has
built a good reputation for itself as a
shipping operation: it does not have
to lean too heavily on the nevertheless
important defence and balance-of-
payments implications of having an
Australian-owned overseas shipping
line to justify itself in the Japan
business.
And, of course, it may be handy to
have an Australian member inside a
shipping conference for a change just
to see what really does go on (although
there are detailed accountants’ reports
of their financial statements already
available, there is probably a bit more
to be learned from the inside).
One intriguing by-product of the
ANL’s application to get into the
Japan trade (which will probably be
made in conjunction with the Japan
Line, with which it is believed to be
planning a joint service) is that it will
raise once again the general question
of membership of the nine-member
Northbound conference. The Japan
Line had been refused entry to the
conference before and had been wait-
ing another appropriate time to apply;
now it looks like getting in on ANL’s
coat-tails. But the three British-owned
“rebels” who were rejected and then
set up in opposition (Port Line, Elder-
man and Bucknall, and Blue Star) will
now be arguing that, if it is good
enough to let another two lines, why
not them? The freight rate war they
began (meat freights were cut 10
percent last week following general
freight reductions earlier) has so far
been very much to Australia’s advan-
tage; it is important that, when the
ANL becomes a conference member,
its first loyalties are to keeping freights
as low as possible, not making profits.
Tariff Board
No need to infer
ONE THING at least has emerged
from the recent ruckus over the role of
the Tariff Board; the Board is in
future to get a clear statement of the
Government’s policy toward an indus-
try when it comes up for examination
by the Board. No matter how offensive
The Australian National Line’s motor vessel Jeparit
it may be for the Board to be told what
it must find (leaving it the task only
of discovering how the Government’s
policy should be implemented), at least
it now knows exactly where it stands
and no longer faces the prospect of
having its reports, like the recent one
on man-made fibres, rejected by the
Government because the Board “had
paid no regard” to the terms of
reference.
For in this instance, as in many
others, the Government (through Mr.
McE wen’s Trade Department) had
included in its terms of reference the
request to the Board to establish
whether assistance was necessary in
the interests of “avoiding the disrup-
tion caused by undue fluctuations in
supply from overseas.” This sort of
inference of Government policy
(which most of the Board ignored any-
way when they decided that fluctua-
tions were facts of life that just have
to be put up with and that it would
not be in Australia’s best interests to
insulate the local industry from them)
will now have to be stated in clear
terms. No longer will the Government
be able to get politically favorable deci-
sions from the Board simply because
of “inferences” in the terms of refer-
ence; now the hand of Government
and its policy is to be clearly and un-
complicatedly evident.
Not that the Board wanted fo be
told that it must do its investigations
having Government policy in mind all
the time; the Board would much prefer
to have a free hand and Mr. McEwen
quite properly reported the Board’s
wishes last week when announcing his
decision to ignore them. On the other
hand, the Board has sensibly taken the
view that if Government policy is to
intrude, it should not be inferred but
stated quite clearly and openly.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy ! September produced a second suc-
cessive monthly deficit in overseas trade when imports
exceeded exports by $31.4m.; August’s deficit had been
$64.4m. The three months of 1967-68 now stand sB4m. in
deficit.
Farm income for 1967-68 may be some slBom. below the
previous year’s as the result of a reduced wheat crop.
For the markets! Industrials became tolerably firm
on Australian share markets, yet the week was dominated
by strengthening miners and oils.
In London equities climbed up on many big individual
gains, aided also by a bullish ICI . . . Interest among the
so-called glamor stocks helped Wall Street to a somewhat
unenthusiastic advance.
For companies! Some recent takeover moves have
grabbed for fresh attention . . . Both Power Mining and
Peko-Wallsend put forth their notices of offer for Mount
Morgan on Friday, October 6; Power is now willing to
take all shares at $4.40 cash each instead of just 51 percent,
but hopes a large Australian interest will be preserved;
Peko takes the conversion from the preference portion, re-
placing it with a transferable option . . . James Stedman
has put in a higher bid than Life Savers in an attempt to
secure Hoadleys equal to $2.68 a share against $2.32;
Hoadleys’ directors have turned toward Stedman.
A brilliant retailing riposte by Myer Emporium saw earn-
ings go from $11,066,022 to $ 13,505,33 7 on sales up by
$34.3m. to $306.9m.; a final percent makes the full 20
percent dividend. Myer is also to make a sl2m. debenture
issue, with no renounceable rights.
More vast quantities of iron ore have been announced by
Messrs. Hancock and Wright, this time very close to
Wittenoom, W.A. . . . Greenbushes Tin may be asking share-
holders for more capital; having ceased bucket dredging for
tin and tantalite, it will investigate other types of alluvial
mining . . . On the aluminium front, Alcan Australia proposes
to finance expansion by raising slBm. from its parent or
other members of the group, while Alcoa of Australia is to
double capacity with the aid of a 20-year loan and a long-
term contract from Furukawa Aluminium, of Japan.
Pipemaker Humes expects bigger sales and profits for the
1967-68 year . . . Pioneer Concrete Services has confidently
brought dividend from 12j to 15 percent on profits up by 30.5
percent to $2,252,423; the dividend should remain after a
l-for-5 issue at 100 percent premium . . . CSR-APM’s Pyne-
board Pty. trebled profit to $770,176.
Appliances aren't holding any terrors for Email, which
has restored a 10 percent dividend rate with a 5 percent
interim and is “trading strongly” . . . The Metters group,
General Industries, has improved earnings in the first half of
1967 and holds its 4 percent interim.
Farm equipment maker Connor Shea showed a dramatic
profit advance from $117,422 to $339,357, so dividend went
from Bto 11 percent . . . Farm and earthmoving equipment
manufacturer Waugh and Josephson made a 15 percent profit
gain, to $616,221; a third successive dividend rise takes pay-
ment from 9 to 10 percent.
Sydney Chrysler and Rootes dealer Harden and Johnston
slumped heavily and had to cut dividend from 20 to an un-
covered 15 percent.
Hotel and colliery owner R. W. Miller maintained 10 per-
cent, although lower provisions were needed to earn a practi-
cally steady profit of $1,928,929; Tooheys, who bought
Miller’s brewery, has made a s2m. private debenture place-
ment . ... . Meat wholesaler T. A. Field plummeted from
$662,033 to $361,928; dividend retires from 8 to 6 percent.
MEN AND MATTERS
DEATH CAME TO two renowned
sons of famous fathers last week when
Mr. Oswald J. Syme died at 89 and
Mr. Randolph B. Carpenter died at 67.
Both these men had been entrusted
with carrying on the companies their
fathers had founded. At his death, Mr.
O. J. Syme had long passed out of the
management of David Syme & Co.,
publishers of the Melbourne “Age,” but
Mr. R. B. Carpenter was still chairman
and managing director of W. R. Car-
penter Holdings Ltd., the island trad-
ing and investment group.
Mr. Syme, the last surviving son of
David Syme, who founded the “Age”
113 years ago, began work with his
father’s newspaper as a clerk in the
“Answers to Advertisements” section,
before moving to the mechanical de-
partments for more experience in how
newspapers work. But his elder brother,
the late Sir Geoffrey Syme, was closer
to the newspaper (he ran the company
after his father’s death).
The family is still well represented
on the board of David Syme & Co.
Ltd.: its chairman, Lt.-Colonel E. H. B.
Neill, is Oswald’s son-in-law; its manag-
ing director, Mr. C. R. Macdonald, is
his grandson, and there are two Symes,
K. A. and D. F., as directors
Mr. Randolph Carpenter, eldest son
of Sir Walter Carpenter, who founded
the W. R. Carpenter group 68 years
ago with a trading post and pearl-shell
business on Thursday Island, in Torres
Strait, became chairman and managing
director on his father’s death in 1964.
Randolph made a lot of changes; in his
13 years at the top, the company’s
shareholders’ funds jumped from less
than $3 million to more than $5O mil-
lion. He took over rival island trader
Morris Hedstrom, bought into a domin-
ant position in the neon-signs industry,
established a major tea-growing project
in New Guinea, and acquired 8.7 mil-
lion shares in Woolworths.
He also leaves plenty of his family
to look after things on the board. His
younger brother, Mr. C. H. V. Carpen-
ter, has been vice-chairman and joint
managing director, and Sir Walter’s
grandson, another W. R., became a
director two years ago.
THE VERSATILITY OF engineers
is as proverbial as their reticence in
public and intolerance of fools. One
meeting these traits, as well as being
one of Australia’s most successful in
carving out a big slice of the construc-
tional cake for the firm he started 18
years ago with a contract to build a
$4OO wool shed, is Melbourne’s C. V.
“John” Holland. Now in his early
fifties, as chairman and managing
director of John Holland Holdings
C. V. Holland
Oswald Syme
he’s just landed another big jetty job
(he built the one in Westernport for
BP) at Port Hedland for Mt. New-
man.
Like the PM, John Holland was a
resident at Queens, Melbourne Univer-
sity, where he took his engineering
degree. The war claimed him soon
after, in the RE’s and “Z” Special
Force, for the full stretch. After it
was over he joined BP and subse-
quently got a group of his old Army
associates together and formed the
John Holland Construction Group,
which went public in 1957 and changed
to its present name four years ago.
These fellows have stuck together and
in the process have won contracts for
practically all the engineering works
you can think up.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Married women
to help the
workforce grow
BY J. C. HORSFALL
MAYBE THE 600 married mothers
and five men who attended the seminar
on “Working Mothers and Their
Children,” organised by the ALP in
Melbourne last week, were not acutely
aware of it but, according to the latest
projections of the workforce, married
women provide the key to a satisfac-
tory rate of growth in the Australian
workforce in the coming decade. This
being so, it might have been appropri-
ate had more men, especially employ-
ers, come along to hear some of the
problems, economic, social, and other-
wise, bearing on the subject. I don’t
want to canvass the social ones here,
rather to focus my attention on the
economic—and especially the situation
in the employment of women in the
past year (that is, to June 30, 1967, to
which the latest Ministry of Labor
statistics relate).
So any hard-headed industrialists
who tend to play down the importance
of married women in their future
employment planning and, for that
matter, governmental planners, should
sit up and take notice. An official
White Paper on the subject in 1965
warned that “It may well be that the
potential rate of growth in the work-
force, and hence the rate of growth
of the economy, is dependent to a sig-
nificant extent on the future increase
in the proportion of married women
obtaining employment.” The plain fact
is that more and more married women
will have to join the workforce to sus-
tain a satisfactory growthrate in the
workforce, because they will have to
make weight for other groups, such
as teenagers, males, and unmarried
females, and indeed the hard-core class
of males between 25 and 59, whose
rates of increase will trend downwards
up to 1976.
It has been projected that, assuming
net immigration of 100,000 a year
(about last year’s rate), the rate of
increase of married women in the work-
force will be about five percent over
the next ten years, compared, say, with
about two percent for the 25 to 59 age
group for males, the lowest rate of
increase of any age group, and with
3.2 percent for women as a whole (in-
cluding married). Although these are
projected figures based on certain
assumptions, which though not infallible
look reasonably realistic, and are not
forecasts, they can be taken as showing
a broad measure of the future role
cast for married women in the work-
force.
Passing from projection to known
facts, it is by no means established
that the projected trend in the employ-
ment of married / women is being
realised, despite the evidence available
between 1954 and 1961. Between these
two census years the numbers of mar-
ried women in the workforce rose
from 258,000 to 406,000 and their per-
centage of the total workforce from
7.0 to 10.9. The projection was for
a percentage of 10.9 to rise to 12.2 in
1971 and 13.4 in 1976. All these per-
centages, it should be said, are below
those already realised by other leading
Western countries. By 1963 the United
States had reached 19 percent, Britain
18 percent by 1964, and Canada 13.5
by 1962.
Unfortunately no census figures are
to hand since 1961; such evidence as
is available suggests that the percent-
age has slipped back since then. We
have to go on the figures for the six
capital cities. These are not wholly
representative, of course, but good
enough because about nine-tenths of
the married women in the workforce
work in them. Since 1961 their num-
bers have risen from 361,000, or about
14J percent of the total workforce in
the six capitals, to 508,000, or 14 per-
cent of the total (both years for May).
So taken over the six-year period,
while their numbers have been going
up, on the average of 25,000 a year
in the past six years, their percentage
has been coming down. On the other
hand, last year to May, 1967, the
experience could possibly have been
more favorable to married women be-
cause, of the 67,000 total increase in
the workforce in the six capitals,
females (including the non-married)
accounted for precisely half, 33,500.
The employment statistics for the
year to June do not differentiate be-
tween single and married women by
types of employment, but the overall
figures throw some interesting light on
the potential directions in which the
female element in general may expect
to be absorbed into employment in the
coming years. Referring to female em-
ployment in Australia as a whole for
the year to June, 1967, but excluding
rural workers and the defence forces,
the number of females employed rose
by 43,100. Of these 12,100 went into
community and business services, tak-
ing the total number of females em-
ployed in that group to 295,600, or
second biggest to manufacturing,
which put on 8400 additional females,
making 305,900. Third-biggest in total
numbers was the commerce group,
mainly retail and wholesale trade, with
a total of 215,100 and a rise of 8800.
The fourth key area of employment
for women was in entertainment, hotels,
cafes, and personal service, which em-
ployed 105,500 at June 30, 1967, or
5500 more than a year earlier. Finance
and property accounting (banking,
etc.) accounted for 70,200, a rise of
2600, and various public authority, em-
ployments not included in other cate-
gories employing 49,000, or 2900 more,
were the only other groups to count
significantly. Two others, transport, and
storage and communications, employed
around 20,000 women each and put on
1700 and 1100 respectively.
It was to be expected, while the post-
war baby boom continues to be reflec-
ted in the supply of teenagers to the
labor market, that service industries
would provide the biggest rise in
female employment last year and, of
course, the secular trend of employ-
ment is also directed that way. How-
ever, even if married women now have
hot competition from their unmarried
sisters in such employments, they can
expect, according to the workforce pro-
jection, for it to fall off sharply.
Whereas in 1961 the proportion of
teenagers in the workforce was 13.2,
the 1967 projection puts it as 11. As
we have seen, between these two years
the proportion of married women is
projected to rise from 9.6 to 13.4 per-
cent, or well above that of teenagers.
Last year was a relatively poor one
for additions to the labor force in
manufacturing. There were a number
of reasons for this, such as the lull in
activity in the first half of the year,
taking up unused capacity in the
second half of the year, when produc-
tion brightened, by greater utilisation
of existing staff, and so forth. This
affected male labor rather more than
female because, of the overall increase
of 19,200 in manufacturing employ-
ment, only 10,800 more males were put
on, compared with 8400 women des-
pite the fact that over all there are
three times as many men in manu-
facturing employment as women.
As one would expect, the major in-
creases in women’s employment in
manufacturing last year were in the
industries already employing most
female labor, notably the clothing and
knitted-goods industry, which at June
30 last employed 74,600, that is,
10,000 more than the next biggest,
foundry, engineering and metal work-
ing. The widespread employment of
women in the latter industry may sur-
prise a lot of people; but contrary to
the general expectation, perhaps, it put
on more women than any other section
of industry last year. This seems to
belie the impression that women are
not accepted in the heavier industries.
But there may be something in the
claim by the Victorian Employers’
Federation that they are frequently in
a minor role within a firm and if a
position of responsibility occurs, are
not even considered. The VEF thinks
the latter is neither in the national
interest nor a wise policy for employ-
ers who have a traditional reluctance
to give females more demanding work.


Timidity in industrial research
LAST WEEK the Government
began to operate its new scheme
for financing industrial research
and development. Advertisements
by the Australian Industrial Research
and Development Grants Board
called for organisations seeking ap-
proval under the Act to submit
their applications.
Under the Act, industrial research
and development means systematic
experimentation or analysis in the
fields of science, engineering, and
technology carried out either by a
company or on its behalf in Australia.
Two weeks ago, the chairman
of the Industrial Research and De-
velopment Grants Board, Mr.
M. H. Scriven, attended an Aus-
tralian Institute of Management
seminar in Sydney on this topic, to
explain to businessmen how his
organisation will work.
But the new scheme goes only
part of the way toward solving
the research and development
problem now facing Australia. An-
other speaker at the AIM seminar,
Mr. L. P. Coombes, formerly the
officer in charge of the Depart-
ment of Supply’s Aeronautical Re-
search Laboratories, strongly
criticised the Australian industrial
research effort. His paper is sum-
marised on this page.
THE SITUATION in Australia regard-
ing industrial research and develop-
ment is one for concern. The Govern-
ment has at last adopted a positive
policy to encourage the growth of R
and D in industry, but when compared
with that in Canada, the Australian
policy appears timid and restricted. The
new Industrial Research and Develop-
ment Act will have to be liberalised to
have any real effect. In addition other
steps to encourage the development of
new and advanced industrial products
should place procurement contracts of
this kind for some part of this require-
ment. Research contracts with industry
instead of expansion of Government
laboratories should also be used where
possible. A more imaginative approach
to the economics of local development
and manufacture is required. The
small local market is a hurdle to
economic production, which can only
be overcome by selective aid by the
Government. There must be areas in
which the national interest shows that
this is justified.
Many factors conspire to deter the
company wishing to innovate. Licences
are straightforward and profitable, while
R and D not only has an element of
risk but entails high initial expense and
annual running costs, together with
special staffing problems. Finally, many
Australians have little faith in the com-
petence of their own countrymen and
are loath to buy Australian-designed
goods. The broad result is that the
percentage of GNP spent on R and D
in Australia is the lowest among the
more highly developed nations, being
between 0.7 and 1.0 percent.
With a population of only 11 million,
the absolute amount Australia spends
-on R and D must be small in com-
parison with other Western nations.
In consequence industry is capable only
of imitation or limited adaptation and
is often incapable of coping with its
own technical problems. Natural evolu-
tion cannot be relied on to correct
this situation: in fact, the large influx
of foreign capital and the many take-
overs of Australian firms by overseas
companies threaten to make it worse.
Like Canada, the Australian Govern-
ment is apprehensive of the situation
and is, rather belatedly, taking steps to
Introduce positive measures to encour-
age the growth of research and develop-
ment in industry. More generous tax
deductions for research were strongly
pressed for by the manufacturing in-
dustry but were rejected mainly be-
cause of Treasury opposition.
Australia is average in its tax
measures. While not ungenerous, it has
not thought fit to bring in the sort of
tax measure which the U.K. and
Canada consider necessary to stimulate
innovation. Canada and the U.K. allow
specially generous tax deductions.
Instead of further taxation deduc-
tions, the Australian Government this
year has introduced an Act to provide
for the payment by the Commonwealth
of grants in respect of industrial re-
search and development. However, the
method of implementation and extent
of the grants may not achieve its objec-
tives. The grants are confined to com-
panies incorporated in Australia and
engaged in manufacture or mining in
this country. A basic condition is that
grants are for new R and D expenditure
only, i.e., will only apply to,companies
which increase their R and D over that
in the base year, 1965-66. To give
confidence in continuity the scheme will
operate for five years and then be re-
viewed.
The grants are of two kinds. The
first are automatic and equal to 50 per-
cent of the eligible expenditure up to
$50,000 in a year, i.e., the maximum
grant is $25,000 in any one year. The
total of such grants is not unlimited;
within a Budget allocation, the funds
will be apportioned according to broad
national interest. In the second category
are selective grants to cover expenditure
beyond $50,000. Whereas, in the first
category, firms have complete freedom
of choice, for selective grants the pro-
jects must be approved, though not
necessarily before work commences.
The Government may vary the grant
below 50 percent of eligible expendi-
ture, this being the maximum.
Grants are controlled by a Common-
wealth Industrial Research and
Development Board, consisting of a full-
time chairman and two part-time
members. It is assisted by a part-time
advisory committee of eight members.
Eligible expenditures are increases in
(a) professional and technical salaries
of full-time R and D personnel, (b)
expenditure upon R and D done for
the company by an approved outside
R and D organisation, and (c) all net
expenditure on plant and equipment
intended solely for R and D. How-
ever, there must be a balance between
capital and other expenditure and
grants for capital will not exceed the
amounts for “work.”
Certain aspects of the Bill have been
criticised in industrial circles. For
example, under both schemes, the grant
is classed as income and is therefore
subject to tax which may be as high
as 40 percent. This would significantly
reduce the Government contribution.
In addition only the salaries of profes-
sional and technical staff engaged whole
time on the research are eligible and
no ancillary staff or other overheads
can be claimed. A company may easily
be spending more than twice its eligible
expenditure on research which in effect
would further reduce the Government
contribution to 15 percent or 20 per-
cent of the total. Whether an induce-
ment of this order is sufficient to stimu-
late the growth of research remains to
be seen. Again, the grant for capital
expenditure must not exceed the salary
costs. In the early years of research
it may be necessary to acquire large
amounts of equipment before staff can
be put to work and the proviso may
operate harshly. The above two restric-
tions do not apply if the research is
carried out for a company by an outside
research organisation.
The provision of Government re-
search laboratories, whose services are
available to industry, is found in nearly
every country, e.g., DSIR in the U.K.,
CSIRO in Australia, NRC in Canada,
NBS in the U.S.A., and CSIR in India.
Some such laboratories are a necessity,
for example, standards laboratories,
which would be beyond the reach of
practically all firms and which would
in any case be wasteful to duplicate.
The national value of most of these
facilities is unquestionable but care has
to be taken that on a national basis-
too great a proportion of funds is not
channelled into Government labora-
tories with corresponding lack of en-
couragement for industrial research
capacity to grow.
In Australia the Government con-
tributes somewhat over 50 percent of
research costs. In countries like the
U.K., the U.S.A., and France, where
defence and space programs are pur-
sued actively, the Government finances
70 percent to 80 percent of R & D, a
large part of which is done by contract
in industry.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
A time to buy
and sell,
but mostly buy
In the City
They sell and buy,
And nobody ever
Asks them why.
But since it contents them
To buy and sell,
God forgive them!
They might as well.
HUMBERT WOLFE’S words, not
mine. And while we’re at it, I would
suggest buying rather than selling as
a good “rule of thumb” at the moment.
The reason? Of the 711 companies
that have reported for 1967, 70 per-
cent have upped their profits and 29
percent have done likewise with divi-
dends. To cap this off, a good number
of companies have announced that
they’re going to do a Linda McGill
in 1967/68 and smash all previous
records.
My own buys this week are both
companies I thought about buying
earlier in the year and didn’t. I should
have. Both are doing remarkably well.
The first one is Nylex Corporation.
This company, which formerly answered
to the name of Moulded Products, is
very big in plastics. Its manufactures
range from floor tiles and industrial
mouldings to hoses, bottles, and gramo-
phone records. Because of this, profits
are very much related to the state of
health of the industrial and consumer
markets. As both markets are
very robust at the moment and look
like staying that way for a while, it
can reasonably be expected that Nylex
will follow suit.
Incidentally, when the books are
ruled off on New Year’s Eve, it will
be the first year that the accounts will
show the result of the company’s $7
million takeover of the fabrics division
of ICIANZ. Clues to the effect of the
healthier markets and the takeover on
trading results were given by the com-
pany’s interim report. This showed that
profits for the June half-year were up
by over 100 percent, while funds
employed by the company were only
50 percent higher (mainly because of
the takeover). Directors said that the
reasons for the profit rise were the
ICIANZ deal and increased sales
activity in the rest of the company’s
operations. They also predicted that
prospects for the rest of the year looked
pretty good. I think so, too.
My second buy this week was Bennett
& Wood, the Honda people. This is
the stock I mentioned about three
months ago as being a good prospect.
Brilliantly, I didn’t buy any. More fool
I. The 1966/67 results show a profit
that has rocketed from a miserly
$44,700 to a handsome $197,700 and a
dividend that has been hitched up from
eight to ten percent. However, things
still look good. The chairman told the
annual meeting that sales for the first
two months of the current year were
already up by 25 percent and that he
expected last year’s turnover of $10.2
million to be eclipsed by a record $l2
million before this year is out.
If the chairman’s prediction comes
true the company will enjoy an earning
rate of 18 percent on capital. If direc-
tors then decide to maintain the cur-
rent dividend cover rate of 1.5 times,
shareholders will be set for another
dividend rise. Although there are a
few “ifs” involved in all this, I still
think the company is a good buy, and
have acted accordingly. Also, I must
admit that the fact that new motor-
cycle registrations have risen 76 per-
cent (yes, 76 percent!) in the eight
months to August did nothing to
dampen my enthusiasm.
The week’s sales earned me two
profits and one loss. The profits came
from two of my oldest holdings, Dun-
lop and Mid-East. They earned $5l
and $l7 respectively. The loss was $2l,
and came from Goliath. It serves me
right. I should have sold this stock
about two months ago when I was
ahead.

A Jones not keeping up
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
WHY CAN’T DAVID JONES keep up
with its rivals? At a time when all of
them have been coming out with excel-
lent results, DJ’s has reported a frac-
tional net profit increase (the $18,643
rise lifted earning rate to 23.33 percent
from the previous year’s 23.23 percent).
And the only reason it rose at all was
an unexplained reduction of $81,511 in
taxation.
The reason for DJ’s stagnation is not
that it is failing to make sales. Like
Grace Bros., it refuses to reveal its sales
figures, but it has reported that sales
rose by nearly seven percent despite
the fact that it was “a difficult trading
year.” But Grace Bros, did not find the
year difficult enough to prevent it lifting
profit by 15 percent after a “substantial”
increase in sales, although it did com-
plain about the stagnant first six months
and the increasingly competitive trad-
ing conditions.
Myers, of course, showed them both
up, with a 13 percent sales rise and a
21 percent profit lift. And there seems
little doubt that, despite the real attrac-
tions of the Grace Bros, group, Myers is
the liveliest retailer in Australia. Myers
promises to do even better in the future,
for it is following the Grace Bros.’
Sydney technique of encircling the city
by doing the same thing in Melbourne;
last year it opened its Northlands centre
at Preston to add to its Chadstone
centre (south east); its Eastlands centre
at Ringwood opens this month; its
Southlands centre at Cheltenham opens
next year.
Myers’ higher dividend (up from 174-
percent to 20 percent) and the $l2 mil-
lion debenture issue at the modest rate
of seven percent suggest that this is all
the benefit that shareholders can expect
this year. But a bonus is not too far
away; the company cannot push its
earning rate much above this year’s 45.4
percent without doing something about
it. Myers’ balance sheet is not yet out,
but the differences between the Grace
Bros, and the DJ’s accounts are striking.
For instance, DJ’s has been running
down its customers’ debt position, with
hire purchase and credit sales debtors
falling $| million to only $5.9 million,
while Grace Bros, lifted its by $300,009
to $6.2 million.
It is also striking that despite its
substantial rise in turnover, Grace
Bios, only made a \ percent addition
to its stocks, at $ll million; DJ’s res-
ponded to its seven percent turnover
rise with an eight percent stock lift
to a gross $27.9 million. But the ratio
of net profit to stocks is fairly simi-
lar for both companies: for Grace Bros,
it is 18 percent and for DJ’s it is 17
percent. In addition, the Gra'ce Bros,
gearing of borrowed funds to capital is
much higher than DJ’s, with almost $2O
million of borrowing on a capital of
$8,2 million against DJ’s similar bor-
rowings on a capital of $22 million.
Nevertheless, there is one significant
difference between the two: Grace Bros,
profits have been rising and DJ’s have
not. It is possible that DJ’s establish-
ment expenses at Bankstown (all of
which were met out of profits) had a
significant impact on DJ’s results, so
that their absence this year should bring
some benefits. But even if DJ’s profits
do rise appreciably this year —as they
should in view of rising consumer
spending the others, particularly
Grace Bros, and Myers (and probably
Waltons, too), seem likely to be able
to do even better.
MORE EVIDENCE to confirm the
view that Consolidated Milk Industries
may be past the worst came last week.
The now-waning war in ice-cream was
clearly the main reason for the 56
percent profit fall and lower dividend
from Consolidated Milk Industries, as
was suggested here recently. For last
week’s result from the Peters Ice Cream
Pty. Ltd. subsidiary showed a reversal
of $272,339 (accounting for all but
$60,000 of the group’s profit fall) as
the previous year’s net profit of
$151,343 turned into a $121,996 loss.
Now that ice-cream prices have
started back up again (although they

The Chartist says:
Mining-conscious investors could well consider CONSOLIDATED RUTILE
as it is in an extremely interesting technical situation with the potential of con-
siderable long-term capital appreciation. The stock was listed late in 1965 and
fell to a low point of 62c before moving in a 140 percent uptrend which achieved
an all-time high of $l.BO in August, 1966. Since then, prices have fallen to 88c
and consolidation has taken place below the $1.40 level. Should prices move
above here on high volume in the short term, a first target of about $2.50 is
indicated and the overall picture suggests that prices could eventually rise to
$6.80 over the longer term. Last sale price on 3/10/67 $1.29.

AUCKLAND REGISTRY
D No. 209/65 IN DIVORCE:
To: FREDERICK WILSON, of Sydney,
laborer, but now of parts unknown,
the husband of MARGARET LILIEN
WILSON, of Auckland. TAKE NOTICE
that your wife has filed a petition for
divorce on the grounds of a verbal
agreement to separate which has been
in full force and effect for three years
or alternatively of desertion. A copy
of the petition with the annexed notice
containing information for you will be
forwarded on application to my office.
If you do not file an answer to the
petition within thirty (30) days from
the date of the publication of this
advertisement the Court may hear the
petition and grant a decree without
your being heard. A marriage is not
dissolved until the decree nisi made in
the first instance is later made abso-
lute and a decree nisi is not a defence
to a charge of bigamy. DATED at
Auckland this 17th day of August,

implications for Peters are significant.
For the company claims it has held its
share of the market despite the savage
competition (and the need to supply
cut-price chain grocers w'ith “own
brand” products that undercut Peters’
own brands). Higher prices should now
bring better results.
SPAWNING NEW types of investment
trusts has offered scope of infinite
variety both here and overseas over the
years. Apparently it is not yet ex-
hausted. The latest to appear on the
local financial scene, the Common-
wealth Securities and Mortgage Trust
No. 1, is really a by-product of the
insurance of mortgages by the Housing
Loans Insurance Corporation, whose
officers, though not connected with it,
are most enthusiastic because they hope
it will give the present thinnest of the
thin market in mortgages a shot in the
arm. The basic idea is to invest the
trust funds in loans secured by
mortgages by the HLIC,. which are, of
course, as safe as a house, because the
latter is guaranteed by the Common-
wealth Government. The expected
minimum commencing net rate of 6J
percent to be paid by the trust and
the higher yields still forecast in the
prospectus, being higher than those on
any bonds except to those favored by
special tax concessions such as the life
companies under the 30/20 rule, should
therefore ensure considerable support.
Apart from mortgage loans insured by
the HLIC, the trust’s investments are
restricted to government securities and
those otherwise guaranteed by the
Commonwealth Government, and de-
posits with the short-term money
market and banks.
Iron ore
A bonanza near Wittenoom?
WESTERN AUSTRALIA’S remark-
able iron-ore pioneer Lang Hancock
has found that doing business in a gold-
fish bowl pays off. It was only by play-
ing on public support that he persuaded
the State Government to grant him the
iron-ore leases he sought at the head
of the Fortescue Valley in August.
Now', either these areas have paid off
to a remarkable extent or Hancock
continues to play the goldfish game to
retain the public support he has won . . .
and w r hich he will need to get his ambi-
tious Fortescue Valley scheme off the
ground.
Last week, with only one drill work-
ing in the area, Lang Hancock and his
business partner, Peter Wright, claimed
that they had turned up Australia’s
biggest deposit of high-grade hematite
within half a mile of Wittenoom blue
asbestos mine w'hich they bought last
year after Australian Blue Asbestos, the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. subsidiary,
had given it up as uneconomic. The
reaction to their find w r as reflected in
the way Perth’s two daily papers
handled it; the “Daily News” ran the
story at the top of page one, spilling
inside, while the “West Australian”
buried it, in comparison, with a 44in.
mention at the foot of page two. The
variance in these news-value assessments
coincides roughly with the variance in
mining men’s assessments of the claim.
Those who believe it is not exag-
gerated can point to the fact that Han-
cock found the original vast Pilbara
orebody and triggered the iron-ore
boom, and w'ith the same aerial spot-
ting technique used around Wittenoom.
Also, he is working with geologist Dr.
Bruno Campana, the man w r ho defined
what is now the Hamersley Iron de-
posit for Hamersley’s parent company,
the Rio Tinto organisation. But those
who detract from the claim, considering
it exaggerated to the point of being
dangerous, point out that some of the
world’s biggest mining companies spent
many years proving up their oreboaies;
for example, Western Mining Corpora-
tion spent months, with extremely con-
servative figures, before slowly ietting
out the extent of the Kambalda nickel
deposit—and this was a crash develop-
ment program. Hanwright Iron Mines
state their estimate of deposits at 300
million tons after only a few weeks
of solid exploration. They are coming
up with very big numbers on territory
which a drill is yet to penetrate.
Against this it can be argued that
other companies were working virgin
country. Hancock, who knows this
scarp of the Hamersley Ranges intim-
ately as pastoralist and prospector, also
ran the Wittenoom blue asbestos mine
for ABA. If he is right, this com-
pany’s face should be red, for one of
their diamond drills, he says, cut
through what he believed to be rich
iron ore.
Hanwright bought the mine last year
and planned to reopen it on the cash
generated from sales of the low-grade
iron ores that abound throughout the
region. This scheme would be given
tremendous impetus if what they claim
is borne out by drilling, but there is
still a long way to go before the rail-
way haulage line that will be the key
to any development.
Hancock and Wright, who plan to
plough back the $4O million in mineral
royalties they say they have or will get,
want this to be the first all-Australian
iron-ore venture. They are taking a big
risk in making known, at this stage,
what they could only have guessed.

The Melbourne marKet
Plugging brokers'
pet favorites
BROKERS’ CIRCULARS are one-
eyed affairs these days. One Melbourne
firm, which used to be noted for floating
smallish companies rather than big ones,
sent us a circular this week to say by
way of introduction that the Australian
economy was soundly based, this should
be a good year for most industrial and
mining companies, company results
have been largely good and many chair-
men optimistic in their surveys of pros-
pects for the current year. The intro-
ductory chit-chat ends there and, of
course, one can heartily agree with it.
But if you are wondering why indus-
trials are pulling themselves up ever
so slowly compared with the latest
bus-catching in mineral shares, it is
because they are having to do so by
their own bootstraps.
This broker, and most others, is
plugging the latter to the virtual ex-
clusion of anything else. It is a pity, be-
cause an awful lot of investors won’t
touch mining shares with a barge pole.
However, even if brokers are not say-
ing it, it seems pretty obvious that
sooner or later the mining boom will
rub off more positively on industrials.
Meanwhile, Western Mining is king
of the market. Not that BHP has been
dethroned exactly, because on Friday
afternoon when WMC had slipped (!)
momentarily from its week’s high of
$26.70, the traditional market leader
bounced up somewhat effortlessly to
$14.00. The superior leaps last week
in WMC would seem to be propelled
by advice such as received from Wm.
Noall and Co. at the end of last week
as much as by anything tangible in the
company’s situation. It will be noted
that the shares had put on 370 cents
between the printing and posting of it.
The advice is that WMC shares are
still cheap at $23.00 on probable de-
velopments in nickel-copper over the
next year to 18 months. A discovery
rate of some 300,000 tons of payable
ore (as has occurred in each recent
month and assuming an average grade
of 2 percent nickel) would justify a
smelter and refinery capable of pro-
ducing 40,000 tons of metal a year. This
compares with an actual current pro-
duction rate of only 5500 tons. The
initial capacity is expected to be be-
tween 15,000 and 20,000 tons a year
and profits of the order of 100 cents a
share could result. Doubling this scale
of operations might well treble profits,
the circular adds; the firm would expect
a higher share price as ore reserves
mount and the huge production
potential is recognised widely.
This is a very good summing-up. But
does it mean the sky is the limit for
WMC? For those who might doubt
it, the circular offers but one alternative
in the text of its circular. You’ve

guessed it. BHP. In case anybody is
wondering, Noalls add that “Western
Mining and BHP are now commodity
stocks.”
BEFORE THE MYER record profit
result there was a mild sort of Mon-
day-morning star-bargains bustling for
the shares and they were jostled up to
over 402 for the first time this year.
Heavy profit taking was absorbed but
they went under the big figure before
returning to 402 cents by the end of
the week as the result was more deeply
reflected. Some of the selling after
the result might have been attributable
to the $l2 million debenture issue
announced simultaneously (though it
is a relatively small one in the general
Myer set-up) and the fact that an in-
crease from 17£ to 20 percent in the
dividend, announced previously, had
already been discounted. The deben-
ture issue is notable in several ways.
It is the first fixed-interest capital Myer
has sought since 1950 (it hasn’t made
a cash issue since 1926). It more or
less ends the long drought in the new
issue market for debentures.
BOTH WILLIS & SONS the jewel-
lers and Wilke & Co., printers and
publishers, drew market attention to
themselves this week, the former for
a one-for-five bonus, a higher profit
and payout; the latter for a one-for-
four issue of 50 cent shares at 75 cents
premium and news that the $3.5 mil-
lion redevelopment of its printing works
at Clayton is well under way, the first
$2 million stage being signalled for
completion by next July.
Despite its dividend lift from 10
to 11 percent and all the rest, the
market is not much dazzled by Willis,
which it puts on a dividend yield basis
of, at first sight, an attractive 8.8 per-
cent with the shares a bare 26 cents
above their dollar par after their
modest rise last week. The profit in-
crease last year was very marginal, a
bare $lOOO or so to $80,742. This gave
earnings of 16.4 percent.
WILKE IS A rather different kettle
of fish, although the shares have been
rather frowned on by the market
since the disclosure of a substantial
write-off being necessary following the
liquidation of M. A. White & Staff
Pty. Ltd., who owed it $321,952 and
a substantial part of which will be lost.
The new issue also brought in sellers
of the shares and the price has come
back from a year’s high of 210 (in
front of the recent result) to 185-190
at the end of last week, at which the
yield was 4.0 percent. The White busi-
ness is only a spasm and with the
shares down this could well be the time
to put a few of them away, since the
group is heading for much better things.


Behind the balance sheets
On being wrong about Bruck
CAN BRUCK KEEP it up? In pricing
the 50 cent shares in Bruck Mills
(Aust.) Ltd. at only 98 cents to provide
the massive earnings yield of 19 per-
cent, the stockmarket clearly has its
reservations about the company’s ability
to keep its profits up around the
recently reported $918,000 (36.9 percent
on capital) for last year. But the stock-
market has been wrong about Bruck in
the past and there is every prospect
that it is still wrong. For so far in the
current year there seems every indica-
tion that profitability is at least as
good as last year and probably
better. At last month’s meeting, the
chairman said that forward orders were
at a record level and the board expects
another growth year, so the vigorous
1967 earning rate could well be
equalled in 1968.
But the reasons for the market’s
caution are quite sensible, in that it has
had its fingers burned in the past by
textilers in general and Bruck in par-
ticular, and that there can be no doubt
that it does depend heavily for its
profitability on Australian tariff policy.
However, that policy has now been
clearly stated and the company is at
last working in a stable environment fol-
lowing last year’s acceptance by the
Government of the Tariff Board’s new
principles in its handling of this
Industry.
In rough generalities, this was to
allow little protection on the “long
run” lines which could invariably be
produced much cheaper overseas, but
to protect these with shorter runs. This
has been ideal for Bruck, which has had
the double benefit of producing a good
enough product in some categories to
transform items that once were regarded
as suitable only for purely short runs
into longer-run items. The economics
of this has meant that both the com-
pany (through higher profits) and the
consumer (through lower prices) have
benefited. This is particularly so in
furnishing fabrics, where Bruck un-
printed fabrics are having significant
retail success, particularly at the
expense of imports.
The chairman has pointed out that
Australia is well on the way to inde-
pendence in cloths and fabrics as a
result of the tariff structure. Bruck
sells more than 20 percent of all man-
made fibre fabrics produced in Aus-
tralia, and has sold fabrics in the free
port of Hong Kong and in U.S.A.,
surely the best measures of its competi-
tiveness. It formed an N.Z. subsidiary
to market Bruck fabrics in 1966-67. It
Is true that success in this industry de-
pends heavily on an ability to stay with,
or ahead of, fashion trends. Bruck’s
management seems well able to take
care of that problem.
Inhibitions which the market has
about Bruck originated in the loss of
$62,000, recorded in 1959-60, a difficult
year, when imported fabrics flooded
into the country. The profits of the
middle and late ’sos were not sur-
passed until 1966, and the latest year’s
advance of 40 percent lifted profit to
not far short of the million-dollar mark
a record. Pre-tax profit rose rather
less, 30 percent, because tax provided
was only 35c in the $1 owing to some
considerable tax relief from invest-
ment allowances, a policy of the Gov-
ernment which has encouraged many
another firm to modernise. Investment
allowances this year could be just as
beneficial in 1967 (capital commit-
ments at 1967 balance date were up
from $814,000 to $978,000) and there
will also be some taxation allowance
for expenditure on developing exports.
A five - year program of vigorous
development begun in 1962 was
scheduled to end this month. (Cost of
plant in the 1962 accounts was
$2,884,000, and at June 30, 1967, it
was $5,319,000 before depreciation,,
after a couple of takeovers.) But, in
fact, capital expenditure is continuing
apace. In the past two years Bruck
spent sl.sm. on new machinery and
another sl.sm. will be spent in the
next two, but, in relation to the sort
of cash flow which Bruck is now gener-
ating, this would not extend finances as
much as it did.
The plant currently works on a
three-shift basis five days a week, with
servicing on the weekends. As the
chairman (Mr. R. J. Vicars) pointed
out in his 1967 address, the re-equip-
ment at the mill and the great expan-
sion of productivity over the past nine
years have been achieved without re-
course to outside financial sources
other than its bankers.
Company policy is to develop an in-
creasingly integrated vertical organisa-
tion manufacturing from basic yarns to
finished fabrics in automated mills.
The trend in profitability (earning rate
has accelerated from 10.9 percent in
1964 to 36.9 percent three years later)
vindicates this policy. Bulli Spinners,
which became a wholly owned sub-
sidiary in 1965-66 after a small loss,
when Bruck bought out its partner
John Vicars, can ensure quick delivery
of specialised high-quality yarns. It
supplies 20 percent of Bruck’s raw-
material needs. (Bruck uses nearly 300
different types of yarn, both filament
and staple, comprising twenty dif-
ferent natural and man-made fibres
from Australia, America, Canada,
Japan, and Europe.) A further example
of integration is the purchase of a
substantial interest in Martin and
Savage Pty. Ltd., a fabric wholesaler
(the $lOB,OOO “other” investments in
the balance sheet) and a small share-
holding in Universal Textiles Hold-
ings because of the close association
with Tennyson Textiles (which mer-
chandises some of its fabrics). The
latest pursuit of this policy is to buy
(for cash) Jertex Pty. Ltd., the Mel-
bourne manufacturer of double-knit
and jersey knitted fabrics.
The company now claims it is among
the most modern and versatile pro-
ducers of high-quality man-made fibre
fabrics in the world, with operations
covering yarn spinning, throwing,
weaving, dyeing, and finishing. The
biggest single end use of these fabrics
is in the fashion field, but a broad base-
has been secured to minimise fluctua-
tions caused by fashion changes, and
other fabrics are used for men’s wear,
furnishing (developed largely over the
past three years) for industrial use, by
the armed forces, and for car uphol-
stery.
The company was established in 1946-
to take over the Australian business of
the then U.K.-based Bruck Silk Mills
(now Bruck Mills Ltd.), which retains
a 19.8 percent financial interest and
technical liaison. It took over a war-
time plant at Wangaratta, Vic. (the-
basic factory was very cheap) and one
of the greatest benefits from this de-
centralised position is the extremely
low labor turnover. The dramatic re-
covery in profits in recent years has
permitted frequent upward revisions of
dividend from 8 percent in 1963 to 12£
percent for the past two years, and the
generation of a cash flow which has-
multiplied more than four times since
1963.
Last year’s decline in current ratio,
because of additional investment of
$571,000 (up 30 percent) in stocks (out-
weighing the 8 percent or $193,000 lift
in debtors) and the 40 percent lift in.
bank overdraft (up $303,000) plus the
capital requirements for plant to be
installed this year, suggest the com-
pany will remain faithful to the tradi-
tion of the percent dividend rate,
at least this year. The company has
never paid higher than this, and 12£
percent was the rate paid for five years
in the ’sos.
For the time being, shareholders
who are buying only about 5 years’
earnings, can count safely on an in-
come yield from a current purchase of
6.4 percent. Shareholders of long stand-
ing have seen their shares recover from
below par a couple of years ago to
their current level of around twice par
value. This market reassessment has
been made on performance, a criterion
that suggests further investment support
could be expected in the future.

Security analysis
What’s the price to bank
on the Wales?
IT IS BECOMING increasingly dif-
ficult to group together companies
which are included in the Fifty Leaders
Index into an industrial classification.
I have chosen the following six com-
panies for this next series: Bank of
New South Wales, National Bank of
Australasia, lAC Holdings, Elder Smith
Goldsbrough Mort, Burns Philp & Co.,
and W. R. Carpenter.
The first two are trading banks, the
third is a “hire purchase” and the fourth
is a pastoral finance company. The
remaining two are not so easily classi-
fied. W. R. Carpenter is classified by
the Sydney Stock Exchange’s Research
Bureau as an investment company, but
Burns Philp appears under the main
industry grouping of “Trade and Ser-
vices.” Both companies could be classi-
fied either way because both have sub-
stantial investment portfolios and both
are engaged in Island trading. For
convenience only, I have decided to
treat them both as “investment com-
panies.”
The activities of these six companies
are, with the exception of the two
trading banks and the two “invest-
ment companies,” sufficiently different
for their results to be quite different.
One could perhaps expect that the first
four might all be affected to some ex-
tent by monetary conditions in the
economy generally, but the distribution
of their customers is probably such that
the effect will be different in each
case. The Bank of New South Wales
will be considered first.
From the point of view of an analyst,
the accounts of the trading banks must
be “taken as read.” It would be desir-
able that some of the requirements of
the Companies Act should be applied to
the trading banks, because the old
catch-cry that the banks must present
a picture to the “public” that inspires
confidence is surely somewhat dated.
The first item which appears on the
right-hand side of the “Statement of
profit and loss” takes sixty-four words
to describe and it could be likened
to “trading profit” if it were not for
the fact that movements to and from
contingencies have been included, as
have profits and losses on the sale of
assets and “amounts written off assets.”
The last item could be a significant and
variable one because the bank only
seems to have “premises” in its balance
sheet and no equipment of any kind.
This suggests that all equipment is
written off as it is acquired. On the
left-hand side of the Statement appears
“Expenses,” which included, so far as
the Bank itself is concerned, $34,000
directors’ fees and $BOOO audit fees in
1965-66 —a total of $42,000 out of
$53.6 million.
Perhaps it will be a help to set out
the figures which are available in a
comparative form. To this end, use
has been made of the pie chart which
appears in the annual report and the
figures have been kept in $ million:
Year to September 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
The sixty-four-word
item 56 6 61 0 70 0 75.7 80 5
Salaries, etc. 31 2 33 5 37 4 40.5 44 6
Other expenses 11.8 12 2 14 9 18 4 19 2
Taxes 5.8 73 89 83 8 0
Profit 7 6 8 0 8.7 8 3 8.7
Indices 1962 equals 100
The sixty J four-word
item 100 0 107.8 123 6 133 8 142 1
Salaries, etc. 100.0 107 2 119 9 129 9 143 0
Other expenses 100.0 103 3 126 2 156 0 162 9
Taxes 100.0 125 9 153 5 143.1 138 0
Profit 100 0 105 2 114 2 109 1 114.2
There must be a fair measure of
estimation in these figures, but, rough
as they may be, they do indicate that
“Other expenses” (whatever they may
be) have been the main factor which
seems to have prevented “profit” in-
creasing at about the same rate as “the
sixty-four-word” item.
Under ,the heading “Profit and loss”
in the review of the year’s activities in
the last two annual reports, there has
been given the percentage increase in
“Gross income (before interest)”. The
increase from 1964 to 1965 was “almost
11 percent,” and from 1965 to 1966
“about 10 percent.” The net figure in-
creased by 8 percent and 6J percent
respectively. This would suggest that
the “cost” of money so far as the bank
is concerned has been increasing at a
much faster rate than the “return” on
money, but without knowing the other
factors which go to make up this net
figure it is not possible to be certain.
The reports have made mention of the
increasing proportion of interest-bearing
deposits, and it may well be that this
trend has had quite a serious effect on
the net figure.
Some idea of the trend in the income
earning assets is of help, and these are
now classified in the approximate order
of the return from them, the lowest
first:
As at September 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
$ mill'liion
Cash, etc. 82 94 112 96 86
SR Ds 113 1 22 180 172 123
Short-dated securities 64 77 71 65 42
Long-dated securities 474 563 614 648 775
Bills receivable, etc. 170 212 250 276 282
Loan's and advances 671 721 822 928 1014
This classification is somewhat arbi-
trary on my part, but there is some
indication of a trend toward longer-
dated and therefore more remunerative
assets. However, as is well known, the
Reserve Bank can control such trends
to a certain extent through the LGS
convention and also by calls to the
SRDs.
At the present time the future looks
a little brighter for the trading banks
generally, and there is little doubt that
the Wales will take full advantage of
any opportunities which may present
themselves. The Wales has always been
quite enterprising, and today it has a
substantial interest in one of the most
highly regarded finance companies
Australian Guarantee Corporation a
thriving Travel Department, and an
Investment Management Division which
manages $175 million.
What will this improvement in pros-
pects mean to the shareholders (beg
pardon, “proprietors”)? Fairly regular
share issues were made from 1907 until
1927, roughly at three-yearly intervals.
Since the end of Wqrld War II there
have been four issues: 1953, l-for-2 at
37£ percent premium; 1956, l-for-3 at
25 percent premium; 1958, l-for-4 at
no premium (par); and 1966, l-for-5
at 50 percent premium.
The long gap and the much higher
premium cannot be ignored so far as
the last issue is concerned. After the
usual adjustment for the bonus content
and assuming that the bonus dividend
paid this year is a “once and for all”
affair, dividend income from a constant
investment made in the Bank of New
South Wales’ ordinary shares in 1962
would have increased only by 8J per-
cent.
We are now perhaps in a position to
fill in some of the usual statistics:
Year to September 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Net profit $ m'HF'on 66 80 8 8 8 4 8.7
Ordinarv caoital $ m. 43.9 43 9 43 9 43 9 52.7

share prices
high s 4.73 6 57 6 95 7.10 5.68
low $ 3.42 4.70 605 5.57 4.82
Currently the shares are selling at
$6.24, which is fairly close to the high
point for 1967 of $6.30, but the price
did fall as low as $5 at one time. Those
who bought the shares back in 1962 at,
say, $4 (the mid-point between the high
and low for the year) would now be
showing a capital profit of nearly 70
percent. They would, of course, have
done better if they had sold out close
to the high point of 1965 • presum-
ably while the speculation was on about
the next issue.
The question is whether the shares
are worth today’s price, showing a divi-
dend yield of only 3.2 percent on the
basis of a 10 percent rate or 3.5 per-
cent if the rate should be lifted to 11
percent. The price/earnings ratio is
13.8 if we assume that this year (which
ended only a day or so ago) the bank
will earn 38 cents per share on the capi-
tal increased by 20 percent 18 months
ago. I cannot answer the question, but
I believe that those who made up their
minds to sell the Wales shares above
$6.50 and to buy below $5 would have
made quite a bit of money over the
past five years and wouldn’t have been
out of the stock for overlong periods.

There’s only one way to avoid it. Get off the plane in time. Fortunately,
between Sydney and Hong Kong, being specialists in The East, we offer 65
different places to do just that. Starting with Manila. And ending up with
Zamboanga. Only one problem. It isn’t that easy
to get off. Because we fly with everything from
French pastry to classical music on the way. We
figure we’ve got you hooked once you get to Manila.
Because Hong Kong is only $4O away. Although
$9.65 to Baguio, return, is pretty enticing, too!

Mining
Who pays for development?
BY AND LARGE Australian mining is
in the hands of big, powerful, and
largely internationally linked groups.
Far from it being any the worse for
that, it is an assurance that inter-
national funds will continue to be
attracted into the industry and its full
development, with attendant social
benefits to the whole economy. This
state of affairs is also good for local
investors, who can do some reaping of
their own as the giants cut their broad
swathes among the ripening corn. From
the national viewpoint it ensures the
utilisation of our vast minerals resources
in the interests of ourselves and the
world at large.
So far, so good. Now, Mr. A. A.
Parish, general manager, subsidiaries,
BHP, raises the further question of the
extent the industry should receive
national assistance in getting its mining
projects into and through their gesta-
tion stages, rather in the same vein as
Mr. Donald Hibberd, of CRA, when
scouting the possibilities of getting sub-
sidies for minerals research a few
months ago.
To some people, like Professor
Maureen Brunt for example, the case
rests on the point that, as the com-
panies enjoy the fruits of their suc-
cesses, so should they pay for doing
all the dirty work. In his talk to the
American Chamber of Commerce in
Australia last week, Mr. Parish put
the case for heightened tax concessions
for mineral search and development on
the Canadian and South African pat-
terns on the grounds that it was a costly
and risky business, but stopped short
of saying that it wouldn’t be vigorously
prosecuted without such assistance. Is
it just possible that in its own case,
as it contemplates the provision of
huge new sums of capital, BHP is try-
ing to touch the various Governments
on the soft spot of local ownership?
This was a spot not within the reach
of Mr. Hibberd.
ABERFOYLE HOLDINGS usually
manages to find an inch or two in its
report for Greenbushes Tin NL, in
which it has a 27 percent stake and
takes more than a mere fatherly inter-
est. This year, Greenbushes was not-
able for its absence, despite it being a
subject on which a few words would
have been most acceptable from the
Aberfoyle board, whose managing
director lately set out for the Far West
on a costly salvage operation of the
company. He has also taken over its
chair from Mr. R. Hare, who has
resigned. Going on the Aberfoyle
report and also on the absence of
questions about the company at last
week’s meeting, shareholders could
have been thinking that everything in
the garden of Greenbushes was lovely.
How wrong they were, though, for its
part, the market had signalled that
trouble was afoot long ago, despite the
latest satisfactory-looking quarterly
report from the field, and had marked
the 50-cent shares down to the dubious
class with a price tag of 24 cents or so.
When the full story blew last week it
was pointless putting them much lower.
EZ INDUSTRIES, whose shares have
swung from 208 to 347 cents this year
in the waxing and waning of profit
expectations, are now under the
shadow of a 20 percent power cut to
operate from the beginning of October.
Sellers now predominate around 275
cents, about midway between the high
and low for the year. The shares have
a lot on their back besides the power
load. The dividend was reduced from
18 to 14 percent in face of a profit
drop from $8,027,000 to $6,786,000 for
the year to June 30 last, largely con-
sequent upon lower realised prices for
sales of zinc, copper, and lead. Last
week’s news from the Tasmanian
Hydroelectric Commissionery was that
the power cuts will get more severe.
London metal prices for zinc and lead,
too, looked on the easy side at
£stg.9s/5/- and £stg.B2 respectively.
PRACTICALLY EVERY other good
thing has reached the Australian min-
ing industry of late, so how far off
is the arrival of computerisation? Dr.
H. Sichel, director of the Operational
Research Bureau in Johannesburg, who
has been over here this last six weeks
or so for the International Statistics
Institute’s meet and has been looking
over our mines from the north to the
south to the west, says it will have
to come soon. He’s not impressed with
our antiquated calculation methods,
which compare most unfavorably with
those in South Africa. He said last
week that full application and statistical
evaluation had lifted output of open-
cut mines in South Africa by as much
as 15 percent. His country could help
Australian mining in solving some of
the deep-level problems such as are
at present being encountered at Mt.
Isa, which is full of “hop spots,” as
Dr. Sichel put it.
THERE’S KEEN competition in the
seas offshore and astride the South
Australian border with Victoria as
both ESSO-BHP and Shell plumb the
depths there with their drilling bits to
see who strikes oil first, if at all. Shell
has so far had no luck at all in the
Otway Basin, and in this, its third
try west of Port Phillip, it has been
having bother again with its giant
Sedco rig. Now it is stuck at 3362 ft.

Commodities
Developing nations
fare poorly
CONTRARY TO what might have
been a general impression, world ex-
ports of the main agricultural com-
modities rose by about 4 percent in
value during 1966. Small as the in-
crease was, it fortunately bettered 1965,
when no advance at all was recorded.
Yet the 1966 improvement still re-
mains under the average rate of the
past few years.
In discussing the result, the Food
and Agriculture Organisation of the
United Nations can only repeat an old,
old story the developing countries
are still benefiting the most from com-
modity dealings. This position is chiefly
traceable to great differences in in-
dividual performance. FAO’s blunt con-
clusion is that the developing countries
“fared poorly.” Total foreign exchange
earnings from the principal commodity
exports dropped by 2 percent in 1966;
between 1962 and 1965 these earnings
had been able to manage an average
4 percent gain each year. As one conse-
quence, the developing countries are
being forced to use more IMF com-
pensatory finance.
Of particular commodities, wheat,
coarse grains, and wool displayed the
biggest gains in value; dairy products
and fats and oils did not advance so
substantially. The declines were many:
cocoa, tea, hard fibres, sugar, cotton,
and rubber. The developing nations
were only able to count on coffee and
jute for significant increases in value.
Coffee presumably felt the benefit of
a 26 percent reduction in overall out-
put, proceeding largely from a 50 per-
cent cut in Brazil’s crop. Jute and
allied fibres put on 10 percent in value,
Pakistan’s lower exports being more
than compensated for by growing ex-
ports of kenaf from Thailand.
Among the items of special interest
to Australia, the FAO mentions that
sugar prices hit their lowest level since
1941. Importing countries are becom-
ing more self-sufficient in the long
term, while the short term is influ-

enced by “uncertainties caused by the
failure so far to negotiate a new
Sugar Agreement.” Russia is now the
largest consuming country.
Wheat’s record crop in 1966 stemmed
mainly from increases in Russia and
North America; the developing coun-
tries produced less.
FREE MARKET prices for wolfram
(tungsten ore) have effected some re-
covery during the past month. The
rises are due almost entirely to worries
about supplies from China. There is
great concern that China’s political dis-
turbances may lead to a cessation of
supplies and to cancellation of the
Canton Trade Fair, which normally
opens on October 15.
China is the principal supplier to
the free market. The October fair pro-
vides one of two opportunities each
year for the Western world to buy
Chinese wolfram.
One other factor influencing the
market at present is that last year’s
Canton shipments are far from running
to schedule; only small quantities are
apparently leaving China.
The alternative, of course, is to buy
from the U.S. General Services Ad-
ministration stockpile —• at much
higher rates and for somewhat lower
quality. It has also to be remembered
that wolfram is a strategic material, so
extra demand could perhaps impel the
Americans to lift their prices.
There are, too, some prospects of
increased supplies from Canada.
December should see Canada Tungsten
Mining Corporation start operating
again; its plant fire last December
(1966) played havoc with the market,
although small quantities kept on com-
ing through.
CASH COPPER (wire bars) ended
last week £stg3.lss higher on the
London Metal Exchange. There had
been a hopeful drift back during the
week, also represented in the forward
price, when it was learned that the
striking American union had suggested
a wage proposal to Kennecott. The re-
action was too optimistic, for the sub-
sequent talks led to no basis of settle-
ment; the talks resumed this week.
American buying on the LME has
naturally been accompanied by cover-
ing moves. October wire-bar dates are
still being protectively covered.

Dealings look particularly busy and bright, with minerals and
oils providing most of the show; the mass of industrials appears
a good deal more staid, though quite firm on sizable volumes.
BHP came up again with a vengeance, adding 80 cents to finish
at $14.00 after hitting $14.05. Western Mining’s contribution
was a $2.70 advance to $25.50. Hamersley also was prominent
with a 70-cent rise to $8.30; CRA gained 50 cents. Oil Search
achieved a par 50 cents by a 15 cents gain. Thiess climbed
another 15 cents to $2.80, while the brewers Tooth and Tooheys
put on 32 cents and 6 cents respectively.

THE LAND
Some advantages of having
a farm consultant
THE CRY OF perpetually rising rural
costs does not cease out of the land.
In such an atmosphere it is surely
no accident that the role and usage
of farm-management consultants appear
to be increasing. Again it would seem
symptomatic that these consultants are
now being tapped as much for their
economic knowledge as for advice on
farming technique. The change has
become particularly obvious over the
past five years.
More and more farmers, especially
the smaller ones, should begin to
realise the benefits to be gained from
this kind of consultancy. The growth
of the extension movement and ade-
quately trained consultants is a very
necessary element to raise farm
efficiency.
To convince the sceptic, or the old-
fashioned, the two latest issues of the
“Journal of the Australian Institute of
Agricultural Science” have brought sig-
nificant evidence. There are substan-
tiated claims that some clients have had
their net farm incomes lifted by more
than 200 percent in five years. In other
cases that increase has actually been
accomplished in two or three years.
Perhaps the chief importance of those
kinds of statistics is to illustrate what
had to be done in the first place.
The initial procedure is usually to
establish a five-year budget applying to
any particular farm, covering methods
to improve productivity and returns,
■estimates of profitability and returns on
capital. A projection takes care of the
necessity for further capital invest-
ment, and the return on this, over the
budget period. More attention is now
being given to the increased capital
value of the property, which may some-
times grow by 50 percent in five years.
Consultants are now finding that the
effectiveness of their economic fore-
casting can be bettered by arranging
actual production trials. These would
doubtless bring even greater advantages
when the one consultant serves a group
of farmers, in a farm-management club.
Between 1960 and 1965 the number
of such clubs in Australia rose from
eight to 82; in this period, too, the
number of consultants grew from two
to 29, the club usually takes in about
40 members, each paying from $2OO
to $4OO a year to employ and share
the professional adviser.
The private consultants are mostly
practising in N.S.W. and Victoria. The
“Journal” sees a swing in N.S.W. away
from clubs to the private consultant,
who has often been encouraged by his
club to start a private practice.
Backing up these generalisations, the
“Journal’s” current issue records
detailed results from a group of farmers
using consultants in the Corowa district,
N.S.W. Twenty-three farms have been
examined, of average size 2214 acres.
The article’s author, Mr. Paul Mc-
Gowan, chairman of the Institute’s
farm management section, does indicate
one moral which runs well with the
way of things “experience has shown
that the best farmers in the community
employed consultants and their returns
would be ahead of the average, whether
or not they employed consultants.” His
survey, therefore, avoids farmers who
did not use professional advice, con-
trasting results from consultancies of
various lengths.
Farmers who had first engaged a
consultant in 1964 earned a gross 1965-
66 income of $19.93 an acre, a net
return of $9.43 an acre, and enjoyed
a total increase in net worth of $5772.
With first advice in 1963, the respective
figures became $21.40, $11.40, and
$10,665. “Old clients” of consultants
showed gross income $24.93 an acre,
net income $13.72, and an increase in
net worth of $14,597; gross income had
advanced from $17.27 in the first year
of consultancy and net income from
$5.97. Those kinds of figures speak for
themselves.
It is worth mentioning also that con-
sultants (and the various departmental
advisers) must have a very special part
to play in the rehabilitation of many
country areas after drought. This can
involve almost as much call for
economic expertness, in directing the
wise use of limited or reduced financial
resources, as for purely technical skills.
An application of cost-benefit is de-
sirable in agriculture as well as in
industry or large-scale development.
Agrisearch
The pride of rural Victoria
VICTORIAN AGRICULTURISTS
are in a boastful mood at the
moment. Apart from the recent display
of pampered animals and polished
produce by the Royal Agricultural
Society, the retiring Director of Agri-
culture, Mr. F. M. Read, has main-
tained the tone in his address of fare-
well. He declares that he knows of no
farming community in the world that
is more productive than Victoria’s.
Each Victorian engaged in agricul-
ture now feeds and clothes 50 people,
Mr. Read says. Since the early 19205,
when he abandoned a whim to become
a doctor and began to cultivate an
interest- in agriculture, he has watched
average farm productivity expand by
four- to five-fold and the total produc-
tion of the State triple. In 1920 the
number of Victorians busy in agricul-
ture was 150,000, but this workforce has
fallen to 100,000, while the total popu-
lation of the State has doubled.
Mr. Read does not claim any per-
sonal credit for this grand achievement,
although he could. Several of his
recommendations have become stand-
ard procedure in the horticultural
industries. Other suggestions of his have
led to improved storage and market-
ing methods. Much of the progress,
he feels, can be traced back to the
School of Agriculture at Melbourne
University. It has engendered a spirit
of readiness to accept technological
change and a respect for knowledge
among the State’s farmers. However,
he recognises that the introduction of
sub clover, Wimmera ryegrass, and
other pasture species has put most of
the whoosh into the Victorian agricul-
tural machine. Disease control,
mechanisation, irrigation, and the
organisation of farmers into political
pressure groups are also acknowledged
as other vital cogs.
The early pasture species were all,
of course, fortuitious introductions.
They could just as well have been
weeds, in which case Mr. Read would
have had a vastly different story to tell.
But his Department was quick to
recognise the immense potential value
of these species and energetically pro-
moted pasture improvement based on
them. The importance of the system
of ley farming engineered by his col-
leagues, and now widely practised far
beyond the State’s borders, should not
be understated, even in a message
designed to congratulate the men on

the land on their undoubted initiative
and enterprise. The cereal breeders of
the Victorian Department of Agricul-
ture also have an illustrious history.
Many of their wheats have been grown
by farmers throughout Australia’s
southern wheatbelt.
Mr. Read’s one regret is that he has
not been able to preside over the
development of an adequate extension
service to complement the work of his
research teams. He believes that new
findings frequently lie idle too long.
The State cannot begin to recoup the
heavy costs of running research facili-
ties and paying scientists until their
discoveries are integrated with prac-
tice and actually making money on the
farms. This issue is likely to become
more pressing. The Department now
has an elaborate fact-finding arm
operating smoothly. The number and
complexity of research results issuing
from the laboratories and field stations
are, therefore, likely to grow rapidly
into a bewildering maze. In addition,
the university schools, CSIRO, and
several other institutions are churning
out facts, figures, systems, and ideas.
Whereas, once upon a time the farmer
was left groping in his lonely isolation
for information, and with nothing to
guide him but his own hard-won
experience, he is now in danger of
being snowed under by facts. Clearly,
an equivalent arm sifting and sorting
and working to keep farmers abreast of
what is pertinent with respect to their
own individual farms is already man-
datory. As Mr. Read says, “extension
must be developed to the highest pos-
sible degree.”
This one-armed system is not pecu-
liar to Victoria, of course. Indeed, all
the other States, with the possible
exception of Tasmania, lack an exten-
sion service. It is a pity that this
State’s productivity cannot be compared
with the others. Generally, however,
the return to capital invested in farm-
ing is greatest where the acres are
broadest. In such areas farming follows
a relatively simple form. This seems to
suggest that as farms become more
intense and complex the farmers run-
ning them need more managerial
skill, but a number of other factors
are involved.
High productivity per acre is the
Government’s goal, but a high return
on capital pleases the farmer best.
Since these two aims tend to be in-
compatible, there would seem to be
some obligation on Government to pro-
vide an independent extension service
to help make the ends meet. A recent
editorial in “Stock and Land,” a Vic-
torian weekly newspaper, intimates that
Mr. Read’s hopes were dashed by Pub-
lic Service Board policy. Meanwhile,
the Commonwealth Government step-
ped in and offered the States a con-
siderable sum for extension. The offer
seemed to be without strings when it
was made over a year ago, but nothing
has been heard of the money since.
It may have been returned to the
Treasury and lost to farming.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Swooshing with Williamson
By DAVID SALTER
“ARE WE IN TUNE?” and after
exactly 4| bars, Malcolm Williamson
had made the first of the 50 or so inter-
ruptions which were to extend the re-
hearsal time for his concerto to more
than an hour longer than the scheduled
studio booking. There had been 30
minutes wasted while the New Sydney
Woodwind Quintet and three other
pianists besides Williamson himself
argued over the most effective seating
arrangement, manoeuvring the two
Steinways and finally pulling the lid
off one.
The wind players retuned to the
piano’s A and began the lento opening
movement again. As they passed the
original trouble spot, the wince of ten-
sion disappeared from Williamson’s
face. They were in tune.
Williamson, short and tubby with
Malcolm Williamson
thin, blond hair reminded one -of a
spectacleless version of Piggy from
Golding’s “Lord of the Flies.” His
dress is a living lesson in how not to
wear colored shirts and paisley ties in
conjunction. But beneath is a person-
ality far more potent and self-assertive
than this gently scruffy exterior would
imply.
Representative of an .earlier Great
Migration to Europe, Williamson left
Sydney for London in 1952 with the
single aim of becoming a composer.
This he did. In the 14 years since he
began his overseas studies and work he
has risen to a position where he is one
of that small handful of British com-
posers who can support themselves and
their families on commissions and
royalties.
He is known perhaps to Australians
only through his music for the Help-
mann ballet “The Display” and the
violin concerto performed at the 1965
Commonwealth Festival. The William-
son catalogue is, however, vast, includ-
ing assorted chamber works, ballets, and
six operas.
At the rehearsal in the ABC’s Forbes
Street studio the uncompromising probes
of a Williamson discussion became
swiftly apparent. Every comment has
an unavoidable sting, usually framed as
a question: Did you miss that entry?
Don’t you think this is a little slow?
Why are we so loud here? Wouldn’t
that be better legato? and with a special
barb, to the other pianists after a par-
ticularly ragged tutti. Can you hear
us? He is intolerant and quick to show
it, an anger which, while rehearsing, the
musicians would rather ignore than
argue with.
Long seasoned in the politics of prac-
tical music,' flautist Neville Amadio,
leader of the NSWQ, kept the peace
by making more interruptions than
Williamson. Soon the composer was
forced to regard himself as just another
player, sharing equal rights both to
comment and make mistakes. Everyone
was happy.
Over a late dinner at the Cross
Williamson talked of the British music
“scene” and the problems of keeping up
with it. To succeed one has to be as
effective a politician as an individual
talent, and Williamson made no bones
about the struggle.
This struggle has turned composition
for Williamson into the decidedly un-
romantic thing it has been for all suc-
cessful composers plain, hard,
utterly exhausting work. He composes
before breakfast, throughout the day,
and into the night “until I drop.” The
strain was so great that at one time
he became an alcoholic of quite serious
proportions. Now, he drinks very
little (if at all), leaves his potatoes and
“dangerous” vegetables on the plate,
and drops Sucaryl in almost-black
coffee.
Even in a relaxed atmosphere, away
from the pressures of a rehearsal, his
“you tell me” response to questions
was an unnervingly political approach.
This persisted when the conversation
strayed to general areas of musical
interest: one came away thinking that
he had few distinct attitudes, or at
least that .he disliked them being made
public.
But what emerged was a composer
vitally interested in the theatre, and
one who recognises the peculiar de-
mands it can place on music. Quite
honest about his ruthless treatment of
librettists (after spending months
working on an opera with one, he
calmly told him that he was very
sorry, he would get another libretto
from someone else), he adopts the
reverse attitude in ballet. The choreog-
rapher has the final word, and William-
son has been quite willing to rewrite
long sections of a ballet score to
accommodate a company’s seemingly
trivial whim.
Like most contemporary composers
he has a tremendous respect for the
late romantics Strauss, Bruckner,.
Mahler -- but, quite unfashionably, he
names Brahms as a special favorite.
Early in his career (another charac-
teristic he has in common with the
modern school) he was a serialist com-
poser a la Schoenberg, but rejected
this technique as restrictive and in-
appropriate to the breadth of forms
in which he wanted to compose.
At present he is particularly inter-
ested in writing for, and making
music with, children. “Moonrakers,”
his most recent opera, is a do-it-yourself
seven minutes of fun where the audi-
ence of children do all the singing
and make effect noises to boot. But
even when directing this piece, as he
did last week in Canberra, he cannot
break the habit of disguising his criticis-
ism as a pointed question: “Is every-
body swooshing?”
Art
Praise the CAS!
By ELWYN LYNN
Contemporary Art Society Interstate
Exhibition and Roy H. Taffs Prize.
Farmer’s Blaxland Gallery, Sydney.
SO MANY PEOPLE have been blow-
ing their own trumpets of late that
you’d think the CAS didn’t have a
trumpet, so though I am closely asso-
ciated with the CAS here’s a bugle
blast on its behalf, for in a community
that gauges its artistic culture by the
activities of commercial galleries, the
CAS remains unprofessional in its
opposition to mercenary promotion and
goes unnoticed in the art areas where


aesthetic discrimination amounts to
choosing between dealers.
Maybe it was not a happy coincidence
that the rise of new art forms was
accompanied by a mushrooming of
commercial galleries, for this has
allowed plenty of galleries there are
exceptions to take the edge off the
■avant-garde movement by having one
or two wild horses in the stable, a
mixed metaphor appropriate to the un-
usual mixtures that one finds in galler-
ies all around.
The CAS plays a kind of under-
ground role; it is irreverent, oppo-
sitional, and concerned not with the
promotion of artists but with art; it
promotes, but does not canonise; it
presents but does not pontificate. What
it does in New South Wales on its
slender means in a year is surprising,
and it is the excellence of the present
exhibition that induces one not to
restrain the hyperboles: it is superior
to the Blake, where 79 works were
chosen from over 400, and the best of
the Waratah exhibition’s artists are
found on the CAS walls.
The Society’s monthly lectures have
none of the effetely polite atmosphere
that prevails at Art Gallery Society
lectures; it has a unique prize of $lOOO,
donated this year for the sixth time
by Roy H. Taffs, the clothing manu-
facturer, a prize won by the noted
artists Len Hessing, Carl Plate, Margo
Lewers, Eric Smith, and Dick Watkins.
This year the judge was Patrick Mc-
Caughey (who had not judged at the
time of writing), critic of the Mel-
bourne “Age” and editor of the Vic-
torian CAS’s broadsheet, as the writer
of this piece is of the New South Wales
broadsheet. The flavor of the broad-
sheets may be gained by noting that
McCaughey has recently discussed the
criticism of Herbert Read, Rosenberg,
and Greenberg and has deplored the
lack of intellectual comment in “Art
and Australia.” Certainly that two such
iconoclastic broadsheets should exist
indicates the need for a more contro-
versial magazine.
The New South Wales CAS (there
are branches in all States) arranges a
Young Contemporaries’ Exhibition each
year to allow younger painters an un-
restricted opportunity to exhibit.
Naturally, the present show is pre-
dominantly abstract and the abstracts
reveal how this form is capable of
varied rebirth; there is the analytic
crispness of Nancy Borlase, the worn
yellow-and-grey plinth by Judy Cassab,
the flickering, swirling foliage forms by
Stan de Teliga, Margo Lewers’ free-
floating shapes with casual linear links,
Carl Plate’s subtle, loose, and elusive
forms in subdued hues, and Alan Old-
field’s crisp, scalloped shapes put down
with the firm eclat of a Stuart Davis.
All these, and the bas-relief by Weaver
Hawkins and the set of six collage-
paintings by Jackson have in common
an analytic rhythm, a dynamic play of
shapes concerned with the way one
shape gives impetus to another.
Others are concerned with shapes
that disrupt areas and the picture
plane: the bright purple, pink, and
orange boomerangs on the top of Mc-
Gillick’s green canvas remain in a
tense situation as if they don’t know
which way to turn; with Watkins the
movement of banded curves and an
outlined “box” reach out of the paint-
ing; in Col Jordan’s triangle, the waves
of colors harden and soften, rush and
waver toward the apex; Michael John-
son slams a large ultramarine Stella-
shape on black; Salkauskas invades
his misty-grey with a beam of black,
splendidly arrested in its trajectory,
and de Groen has a choreography of
swelling and slender shapes in black-
and-white.
There’s a new lyrically rhythmic
approach around, too, with Carole
Symonds’ white flower-like foam un-
furling, Syd Ball’s luxurious ochre flag
striped in praise of Persian elegance,
Warren’s wedding of fragile, crisp
shapes with nebulous voids, Harpur’s
most sensitively placed “smudges” on
white; on Wendy Paramor’s yellow,
plain elusive rows of golden diamonds
are wafted up, and Aspden has a great
crimson-purple, pulsating raincloud.
There are more associational works
with Peascod’s unrelenting textures, Joe
Rose’s romantic-surreal figures, and
Eva Kubbos’ smoky landscape; Jones-
Roberts has a swirling, melting bather,
Looby some distorted men, emaciated
and tightly packed and hating every
moment of it. At the opposite pole Roy
Churcher has a Bonnardish still-life
with finely controlled areas all about the
easy life, and though last on this list—
and to list here, as with Old Testament
genealogies, is to praise Ken Rein-
hard presents one of his most subtle
balances of nude, geometry, and colored
cubes.
Oh, yes, Robert Parr has an actual
battered table with two lemons and a
real cornet which you can’t blow . . .
but I hope I’m forgiven for this one
blast for the CAS so splendidly sup-
ported by its members.
Films
Lame game
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Game Is Over. Director, Roger
Vadim.
Pharaoh. Director, Jerzy Kawalerowicz.
IN HIS CREDIT TITLES Roger
Vadim is careful not to say that his
film is based on Emile Zola’s “La
Curee” it’s only “inspired” by it.
Frankly, I believe Zola would disclaim
even such a vague connection as that.
Certainly the central situation is
Zola material the bored second wife
of a businessman starts a casual love
affair with the stepson, who is much
nearer her own age, then, by falling
desperately in love, a passion which
embarrasses the much less infatuated
youth, involves the family in tragedy
and despair. Zola can treat such a
plot on a deep emotional level, bril-
liantly illuminating the conflict of man’s
basic passions and his acquired social
rules.
But Vadim’s treatment is all on the
surface. The film is glossy, modish,
shallow; the very clarity of the color
photography removes any impression
of reality or, despite the numerous
love-making sequences, of eroticism.
Jane Fonda and Peter McEnery are
a pretty pair indeed, but they generate
no more human warmth than a pair
of expensive dolls. So one can’t work
up any great sorrow for the sufferings
of the woman destroyed by irresistible
passion. The profoundest emotion I
felt was irritation at a silly chit who
didn’t know when she was well off.
She had the game sewn up (not over),
being young and pretty with a nice,
indulgent husband, who was often away
from home, and a lusty lover actually
living in the same house.
The ending is abrupt and unsatisfac-
tory, as if Vadim himself had tired of
the whole enterprise; he never explains
his numerous shots throughout the film
of the husband’s pack of savage hunt-
ing dogs, who’ve been snarling and
slavering in a most promising manner.
A pity—l’d expected great things of
those dogs.
The many admirable qualities of
the Polish-made “Pharaoh” sometimes
become its greatest disadvantages. In
its very attempts to avoid the excesses
and vulgarities of the usual historical
epic it often goes to the other extreme
of stodginess and understatement. The
dubbing into English, taking absolutely
no account of the players’ lip move-
ments, is no help; it’s drearily written,
and the unseen speakers are a dull and
droning lot. But the film is often inter-
esting visually and gives an admirably
unromantic, unglamorous view of a
brutal era of power politics and the
young Pharaoh’s sincere attempts to
free his country from the thrall of
the High Priests and the Phoenician
financiers. Honestly dedicated, but hot-
headed and immature, he’s no match
for the professionals.
Aside from the dubbing, the sound-
track is imaginative, with natural
sound instead of the surges of pea-soup
music that generally accompany an
epic. Kawalerowicz makes interesting
use of the rasping whisper of feet in
dry sand, the harsh breathing of
exhaustion, the thud of stones on
shields, footsteps echoing in a stone
temple. Indeed, he’s so obsessed by
footsteps that nobody seems able to
move an inch without either crunching
or clanking. Pharaoh’s love scenes with
three different girls, who confused me
by looking identical, seem rather per-
functory, as if the director felt in duty
bound to include sex in an epic, how-
ever irrelevantly. He even gives us the
standard orgy, which looks as dull as
ever.


Theatre
Quixote alive
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Man of La Mancha. Dale Wasserman.
Comedy, Melbourne.
White with Wire Wheels. Jack Hibberd.
University of Melbourne.
THESE DAYS any author, alive or
dead, is likely to wake up one morn-
ing and find that he’s been orchest-
rated. This undignified fate has be-
fallen such unlikely bedfellows as
Steinbeck, Shakespeare, Shaw, Wilde,
Dickens, Michener, Coward, and
Robert Browning. But could there be
a more surprising librettist than Miguel
de Cervantes?
I approached Broadway’s Quixote
with understandable trepidation. How-
ever, it is my duty to admit that “Man
of La Mancha” is a splendid piece of
theatre which does the cadaverous old
crusader proud.
Where most musicals titillate with
tons of tulle and' scintillate with
sequins, “La Mancha” is as severe as
an Army blanket, taking its visual in-
spiration from Dore and Daumier.
Where most musicals are crammed with
hit songs of questionable relevance,
Mitch Leigh’s score is only concerned
to advance the plot. As well as lack-
ing conventional sets and a curtain,
the production dispenses with an inter-
val.
The result is a musical, which, by
dispensing with the usual 19th-century
ballast, is extremely effective in
modem theatrical terms.
The author sets “La Mancha” in the
Inquisition’s prison, as Cervantes awaits
his trial for theological delinquency.
Threatened by the jail’s complement
of thieves and murderers, he attempts
to entertain them with the story of
his woeful knight, giving the prisoners
parts and direction. Scene changes are
suggested in the best Brechtian man-
ner by mime and simple props.
To me, Quixote should be as tall
as a church spire and as poignant as
Chaplin’s tramp as the marmoreal
Cherkassov played him in the brilliant
Russian film. So I was disappointed
by Charles West’s performance. He
seemed too short, sane, and credible.
Yet, there’s no denying that he held
his audience completely captive, Suz-
anne Steel, played Aldonza, the Magda-
lanean whore whom Quixote trans-
forms, and gave an exceptional per-
formance. The only completely unsatis-
factory role was Robert Healey’s
Sancho, who, while appropriately
spherical, lacked sufficient bounce. The
rest of the cast gave an impressive
ensemble performance, and the musical
Edwin Hodgeman, John Krummel,
Jennifer Hagan, and Jeanie Drynan
in "Hedda Gabler ." Old Tote, Sydney
direction and lighting were first-class.
Jack Hibberd, a young Melbourne
doctor turned playwright, borrows
from both Pinter and Humphries for
his first full-length play. He documents
the mores of three junior executives
who view girls with genuine interest
but keep their real passion for cars.
All the girls in “Wire Wheels” are
played by the one actress, as, accord-
ing to Hibberd, young Australian men
believe that a girl is a girl is a girl.
But cars? They’re different.
Wasting no time on euphemisms, his
eight scenes are quite legitimately foul-
mouthed. They are also awash in beer,
a fact which produced increasing
naturalism in the performances. As a
social documentary, “Wire Wheels” is
accurate and depressing.
Strong "Hedda"
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Hedda Gabler. Ibsen. Old Tote, Syd-
ney.
ONCE AGAIN, as we have come to
expect from this company, the Old
Tote has presented us with a crafts-
manlike production, well rehearsed,
well designed, and skilfully acted by the
whole cast. Because a lot of thought
has plainly gone into this production
(as is always the case with Robert
Quentin’s work) the result has a
strength and resilience which enables
it to stand up to discussion and criti-
cism.
This “Hedda Gabler” is a well-
made production of a well-made play.
No matter how shocking its message,
or lack of message, as many com-
plained, may have seemed in 1890,
today one is chiefly struck by the
precision and neatness of its construc-
tion, by the fact that each character
is a careful psychological study, and
that it is set in an elegantly furnished
drawing-room. Nowadays, when chaos
is so often represented chaotically,
such a play seems at first glance almost
cosy. But, in fact, the violence which
explodes in this conventional setting
is the more shocking by contrast.
Robert Quentin has taken the un-
usual step of using a young cast, all
NIDA graduates. He has pointed out
that Hedda Gabler is usually played
by mature actors in their forties,
whereas the ages of Tesman and
Hedda are 33 and 29.
John Krummel is excellent as the
gentle, bumbling, scholarly Tesman,
who is so proud of having captured
the beautiful Hedda Gabler, and who
has no idea what sort of woman his
wife really is.
Jennifer Hagan’s Hedda, dark-
haired and dramatic-looking, restless
but fiercely controlled, is a remark-
ably good performance for a young
actress. At the same time it is illumin-
ating for what it is not. Watching
Jennifer Hagan I thought that I had
never realised before how ill-bred
Hedda seemed in her treatment of the
people who infuriated her: her good-
natured husband, his kindly aunt and
the gentle Thea Elvsted. Then I came
across Ibsen’s note that he hoped the
actress who was to play Hedda would
“endeavor to find a way of expressing
the demonic aspect of the character.”
This “demonic aspect’,’ is not fully real-
ised by Jennifer Hagan, so that at times
she does seem merely vulgar.
Jeanie Drynan, perhaps too pretty
for Thea Elvsted, is nevertheless very
good with- her soft, fluttery manner,
timidly brave in face of the fierce
Hedda. Charles Little’s somewhat dis-
hevelled-looking Eilert Lovborg man-
ages to seem both romantic and
slightly absurd, as he should, even if
he is a little lacking in poetic fire. It
always proves a difficult part to play.
Edwin Hodgeman has an easier task,
which he does very well, as the worldly,
cynical Judge Brack.
The proposal to use the NIDA
graduates in a permanent repertory
company, as outlined in the program
note, promises to work well, judging
from this production. But the further
aim mentioned, of finding a “way of
interpreting the great playwrights,
which is essentially Australian,” seems
to me more dubious. No doubt a local
style will develop, but the aim should
be to understand the dramatist’s in-
tentions and present them as faith-
fully as possible. It is my observation
that there is an Australian tendency to
be rather cavalier about this, but it is
not a fault that has been characteristic
of the Old Tote. However, there is
one small but glaring example in this
production, which is very attractively
designed by Robin Lovejoy, and it is
precisely a fault of sacrificing the
dramatist’s intention to attractiveness:
this is the beautiful blue costume which
Thea wears when she should be quite
unmistakably a little shabby.

Music
Notes on notes
By PAUL FROLICH
TO TEST the genuineness of the grow-
ing interest in good music, including
recent Australian music, Musica Viva
helped to organise the first Canberra
Spring Festival, with 17 varied sessions
spread over three days and four even-
ings. Although Canberra, generally, did
not appear to be aware of the Festival’s
existence, it was well enough supported
by interested and even enthusiastic
audiences. I would guess that at least
half of those attending live in or near
Canberra; the rest came mainly from
Sydney and Melbourne, with a sprink-
ling of visitors from other States.
Performers included the Vegh Quar-
tet (not heard by me on this occasion)
and the Camerata Bern, both groups
from Switzerland, as well as the leading
chamber players from Sydney, Mel-
bourne, and Canberra, and, as a kind
of unifying element, a group of six
composers: Nigel Butterley, George
Dreyfus, Peter Sculthorpe, Larry Sitsky,
Felix Werder, and, brought back from
England after 15 years’ absence, Mal-
colm Williamson. Not surprisingly,
interest largely centred on this group,
. the more so as works by all but Sitsky
were performed during the Festival.
The composers, two at a time,' were
brought forward to discuss aspects of
their work and some of their ideas
before an intelligently participating
audience and it became evident that
many listeners shed some of their reser-
vations about new sounds and new musi-
cal methods in face of the composers’
straightforward explanations.
The music heard was not, of course,
necessarily all novel. The sixth string
quartets by Sculthorpe and Werder,
interesting and well-made works both,
were already known to many of us
from previous readings by the excellent
Austral String Quartet, members of the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Nigel
Butterley was represented by a new
work, “Variations,” scored for wind
quintet, piano, and recorded piano.
Though not, perhaps, of immediate
audience-appeal, I found this to be
stimulating music which impressed by
its terse organisation and many-sounded
variety.
George Dreyfus was represented by
his Galgenlieder for baritone, violin,
flute, clarinet, and bassoon. This cheeky
cycle of spoof-filled songs was even
better fun than on first hearing and
aroused the delighted audience to a
genuine ovation in tribute to a very
fine musician. Mr. Williamson who,
since his recent arrival, has spoken fre-
quently and usefully about our musical
needs, contributed a personality far
more provocative than his music. Dur-
ing the seminar session, he soundly
reasoned for his methods in writing
popularly successful operas and stated,
very justly, that many modern trends
are 1 simply not well suited to opera,
which must, in the first place, be sing-
able. This thesis was well illustrated by
a recorded excerpt from his “Julius
Caesar Jones” in which Strauss’ meth-
ods of writing for the voice are very
skilfully exploited.
After this, it was to be regretted that
Mr. Williamson’s chamber works heard
in Festival performances proved much
less convincing. His “Serenade” for flute,
piano, and string trio proved attractive
enough on first inspection, but I very
much doubt that either its ingratiating
second movement or the third, which
relies almost wholly on speed for its
effect (the composer calls it “almost
a Presto impossible”!) , would keep me
interested for long. Rather worse, to
my ear, was the Concerto for Wind
Quintet and Two Pianos Eight Hands
in which the composer uses all the
thunderous effects of eight hands to
convey a message which one hand
might have amply coped with. Mr.
Williamson’s final contribution to the
Festival was the delightful audience-
participation children’s cantata “The
Moonrakers.” This is good, clean fun,
well organised and it was thoroughly
enjoyed by the many children, who
sang with gusto. It did, however, make
me wonder at the composer’s previously
publicised railings against Sullivan.
Australian works did not, of course,
dominate the Festival not even the
remainder of my own listening. Owing
to the use of two halls, none could
attend all sessions and one’s selection
was arbitrarily dictated by personal
preferences. I had the good fortune
of hearing two concerts given by the
Camerata Bern, a group of twelve
young string players. Whatever their
individual accomplishments may be,
this is easily the best ensemble of its
kind known to me. Seemingly un-
affected by the lack of a conductor,
they gave brilliant and spontaneous
performances of everything they under-
took, their precision unmarred by the
mechanical accuracy which often
impedes such groups. They played very
beautifully in the traditional repertoire
J. C. Bach, Handel, contrapuntal
Purcell, Mozart, and J. S. Bach but
their greatest achievements were in
Britten’s “Simple Symphony,” Stra-
vinsky’s cheekily rhythmic and sonorous
Concerto in D of 1947 and, best of all,
in Frank Martin’s “Etudes,” written in
1956, a clean and vigorous work which
I’d cheerfully hear a few more times.
Listeners whose appetite for more
recent music had been whetted by the
composers’ discussions were afforded a
rare treat in complete performances of
Schoenberg’s masterpiece, “Pierrot
Lunaire.” This seldom-heard work for
voice, piano, string trio, flute, and clari-
net was brilliantly presented under
Robert Pikler’s meticulous direction,
with Marilyn Richardson supplying the
sprechstimme, something in between
speech and song. To my surprise, I
found the music stimulating and far
from unpleasant and should, in fact,
willingly hear it again soon.
As is fitting, the Festival’s greatest
moments were left to its very end, and,
true to Musica Viva’s history of
development, were supplied by the finest
of our own performers in some of the
best chamber music of another era. In
the last concert, vice-regally patronised,
were works by Schubert, opening with
the Trout Quintet played by Ernest
Llewellyn, Robert Pikler, John Painter,
Walter Sutcliffe, and Joyce Hutchinson.
Since his departure from the Sydney
scene, Mr. Llewellyn has been busy
building up the Canberra School of
Music and his concert appearances with
old friends have become rare. For all I
know, rehearsals may have been scanty,
but the spark that flew between
Llewellyn and Pikler was sufficient to
ignite the other players and the result
was one of the most miraculously de-
lightful performances I’ve yet heard.
Readers may be aware that I regard
Robert Pikler as wholly unique in our
musical life and my effusions over his
musicianship are old hat; I must admit,
though, that I found the playing of all
five artists close to perfect. After the
piano quintet, Joyce Hutchinson re-
turned to accompany contralto Lauris
Elms in four of Schubert’s songs. Miss
Elms’ rich voice shone as convincingly
with lyrical tenderness as it did with
dramatic urgency and this vocal inter-
lude was yet another joyful event.
Finally came that greatest statement
for string ensemble, the C major String
Quintet, known as opus 163. With
Donald Hazelwood as second violinist
and the sensitive Lois Simpson joining
her cello to John Painter’s, one could
but sit spellbound lest one’s coarse
breath disturb the urgent breathing of
the enchanted Adagio or the sweet wist-
fulness of the Allegretto.


we have faced in Vietnam, as is even
now' being mounted in Thailand, and
as could be launched in any of a half-
dozen other spots in the Chinese
shadow. Vietnam has shown how dif-
ficult it is to make clear the distinction
between this and an ordinary factional
civil war, and how subject the assist-
ing power is to charges of having inter-
vened in an internal matter. Vietnam's
neighbors know that the war there is
not internal, but our allies in Europe
have difficulty grasping the fact.
The fragmenting of the communist
world has lent credence to the fre-
quently heard argument that a com-
munist advance by proxy, as we have
seen attempted in Vietnam, is of only
peripheral importance; that with the
weakening of rigid central control of
the communist world, local fights be-
tween communist and non-communist
factions are a local matter. This ig-
nores, however, the fact that with the
decentralisation of communist control
has come an appropriately tailored shift
in communist tactics. National Com-
munism poses a different kind of threat
than did the old-style international
Communism, but by being subtler it
is in some ways more dangerous.
SEATO was useful and appropriate
to its time, but it was Western in
origin and drew its strength from the
United States and Europe. It has weak-
ened to the point at which it is little
more than an institutional embodiment
of an American commitment, and a
Somewhat anachronistic of the
days when France and Britain were
active members. Asia today needs its
own security undertakings, reflecting the
new realities of Asian independence
and Asian needs.
Thus far, despite a pattern of rapidly
increasing co-operation in cultural and
economic affairs, the Asian nations
have been unwilling to form a military
grouping designed to forestall the
Chinese threat?, even though several
have bilateral arrangements with the
United States. But an appropriate
foundation-stone exists on which to
build; the Asian and Pacific Council.
ASPAC held its first ministerial-level
meeting in Seoul in June, 1966, and its
second in Bangkok in July, 1967. It
has carefully limited itself to strength-
ening regional co-operation in economic,
cultural, and social matters, and its
members have voiced strong feelings
that, as Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeo
Miki put it at the Bangkok meeting, it
should not be made “a body to promote
anti-communist campaigns.”
Despite ASPAC’s present cultural
and economic orientation, however, the
solidifying awareness of China’s threat
should make it possible if the need
for a regional alliance is put in suffici-
ently compelling terms to develop
it into an alliance actively dedicated
to concerting whatever efforts might
be necessary to maintain the security
of the region. And ASPAC is peculiarly
well situated to play such a role. Its
members (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan,
Thailand, Malaysia, South Vietnam,
the Philippines, Australia, and New
Zealand, with Laos as an observer) all
are acutely conscious of the Chinese
threat. All except Malaysia have mili-
tary ties with the United States. It
has the distinct advantage of including
Australia and New Zealand, which
share the danger and would be able to
contribute substantially to its strength,
without an unbalancing great-power
presence.
I do not mean to minimise the diffi-
culties of winning acceptance of such
a concept. In Japan, public opinion
still lags behind official awareness of
military needs. The avowedly neutral-
ist nations under China’s cloud would
be reluctant, at present, to join any
such grouping. But looking farther down
the road we can project either an
erosion of their neutralism or the for-
mation of their own loose association
or associations, which might be tied into
a militarily oriented ASPAC on an
interlocking or co-operative basis. One
can hope that even India might finally
be persuaded to give its support, having
itself been the target of overt Chinese
aggression, and still cherishing as it
does a desire to play a substantial role
beyond its own borders.
Military security has to rest, ulti-
mately, on economic and political
stability. One of the effects of the
rapidity of change in the world today
is that there can no longer be static
stability; there can only be dynamic
stability. A nation or society that fails
to keep pace with change is in danger
of flying apart. It is important that
we recognise this, but equally import-
ant that in trying to maintain a dynamic
stability we remember that the stability
is as important as the dynamism.
If a given set of ends is deemed
desirable, then from the standpoint of
those dedicated to peace and an essen-
tial stability in world order the desi-
deratum is to reach those ends by evolu-
tionary rather than revolutionary means.
Looking at the pattern of change in
non-communist Asia, we find that the
professed aims of the revolutionaries
are, in fact, being achieved by an
evolutionary process. This offers a
dramatic opportunity to draw the dis-
unction between the fact of a revolu-
tionary result and the process of revo-
lutionary change. The Asian nations
are showing that evolutionary change
can be as exciting as revolutionary
change. Having revolutionised the aims
of their societies, they are showing what
can be achieved within a framework
of dynamic stability.
The “people,'' in the broadest sense,
have become an entity to be served
rather than used. In much of Asia,
this change represents a revolution of
no less magnitude than the revolution
that created the industrial West, or
that in the years following World War
II transformed empires into new and
struggling nations. It is precisely the
promise of this reversal that has been
at the heart of communist rhetoric,
and at the heart of the popular and
intellectual appeal which that rhetoric
achieved.
Not all the governments of non-
communist Asia fit the Western ideal
of parliamentary democracy—far from
it. But Americans must recognise that
a highly sophisticated, highly advanced
political system, which required many
centuries to develop in the West, may
not be best for other nations which
have far different traditions and are
still in an earlier stage of development.
What matters is that these govern-
ments are consciously, deliberately, and
programmatically developing in the
direction of greater liberty, greater
abundance, broader choice, and increas-
ed popular involvement in the processes
of government.
Poverty that was accepted for cen-
turies as the norm is accepted no longer.
In a sense it could be said that a new
chapter is being written in the winning
of the West: in this case, a winning of
the promise of Western technology and
Western organisation by the nations of
the East. The cultural clash has had
its costs and produced its strains, but
out of it is coming a modernisation of
ancient civilisations that promises to
leap the centuries.
The process produces transitional
anomalies such as the Indian woman
squatting in the mud, forming cow-
dung patties with her hands and laying
them out to dry, while a transistor
radio in her lap plays music from a
Delhi station. It takes a long time to
bring visions of the future to the far
villages - but time is needed to make
those visions credible and make them
achievable. Too wide a gap between
reality and expectation always produces
an explosive situation, and the fact that
what the leaders know is possible is
unknown to the great mass of the pea-
santry helps buy time to make the pos-
sible achievable. But the important
thing is that the leaders do know what
is possible, and by and large they are
determined to make it happen.
Whether that process is going to pro-
ceed at a pace fast enough to keep one
step ahead of the pressure of rising
expectations is one of the great ques-
tions and challenges of the years ahead.
But there is solid ground for hope. The
successful Asian nations have been writ-


ing extraordinary records. To call their
performance an economic miracle
would be something of a semantic im-
precision; it would also be a disservice.
Precisely because the origins and in-
gredients of that success are not
miraculous, it offers hope to those which
have not yet turned the comer.
India still is a staggering giant,
Burma flirts with economic chaos, and
the Philippines, caught in a conflict of
cultures and in search of an identity,
lives in a precarious economic and
social balance. But the most exciting
trends in economic development today
are being recorded by those Asian
nations that have accepted the keys
of progress and used them. Japan,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Korea,
Singapore, and Malaysia all have been
recording sustained economic growth
rates of 7 percent a year or more;
Japan has sustained a remarkable aver-
age of 9 percent a year since 1950,
and an average of 16.7 percent per
year increase in exports over the same
period. Thailand shifted into a period
of rapid growth in 1958 and has aver-
aged 7 percent a year since. South
Korea, despite the unflattering esti-
mates of its people’s abilities by the
average GI during the Korean War, is
shooting ahead at a growth rate that
has averaged 8 percent a year since
1963, with an average 42 percent a year
increase in its exports.
These rapidly advancing countries
vary widely in their social traditions
and political systems, but their methods
of economic management have certain
traits in common: a prime reliance on
private enterprise and on the pricing
mechanisms of the market as the chief
determinant of business decisions; a
pacing of monetary expansion to match
growth in output; receptivity to private
capital investment, both domestic and
foreign, including such incentives as
tax advantages and quick government
clearance of proposed projects; imagina-
tive national programs for dealing with
social problems; and, not least, a gen-
erally restrained posture in government
planning, with the government’s role
suggestive rather than coercive. These
nations have, in short, discovered and
applied the lessons of America’s own
economic success.
Any discussion of Asia’s future must
ultimately focus on the respective roles
of four giants: India, the world’s most
populous non-communist nation; Japan,
Asia’s principal industrial and economic
power; China, the world’s most popu-
lous nation, and Asia’s most immediate
threat; and the United States, the
greatest Pacific power. (Although the
USSR occupies much of the land map
of Asia, its principal focus is toward
the West, and its vast Asian lands are
an appendage of European Russia.)
India is both challenging and frus-
trating: challenging because of its pro-
mise, frustrating because of its per-
formance. It suffers from escalating
over-population, from too much empha-
sis on industrialisation and not enough
on agriculture, and from too doctrinaire
a reliance on government enterprise in-
stead of private enterprise. Many are
deeply pessimistic about its future. One
has to remember, however, that in the
past five years India has fought two
wars and faced two catastrophic
droughts. On both the population and
the agricultural fronts, India’s present
leaders at least are- trying. And the
essential factor, from the standpoint of
U.S. policy, is that a nation of nearly
half a billion people is seeking ways
to wrench itself forward without a
sacrifice of basic freedoms; in exceed-
ingly difficult circumstances, the ideal
of evolutionary change is being tested.
For the most populous representative
democracy in the world to fail, while
communist China -- surmounting its
troubles succeeded, would be a dis-
aster of world-wide proportions. Thus
the United States must do two things:
(1) continue its aid and support for
Indian economic objectives; and (2)
do its best to persuade the Indian Gov-
ernment to shift its means and adjust
its institutions so that those objectives
can be more quickly and more effect-
ively secured, drawing from the lessons
not only of the United States but also
of India’s more successful neighbors,
including Pakistan.
Japan has been edging cautiously and
discreetly toward a wider leadership
role, acutely conscious at every step
that bitter memories of the Greater
► East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere might
rise to haunt her if she pressed too
hard or too eagerly. But what would
not have been possible ten, or even five,
years ago is becoming possible today.
Half the people now living in Asia
have been born since World War 11,
and the new generation has neither the
old guilts (in the case of the Japanese
themselves) nor the old fears born of
conquest.
The natural momentum of Japan’s
growth, the industry of her people, and
the advanced state of her society must
inevitably propel Japan into a more
conspicuous position of leadership.
Japan’s industrial complex, expanding
by 14 percent annually since 1950,
already is comparable to that of West
Germany or the United Kingdom.
Japan’s gross national product ($95
billion) is substantially greater than
that of mainland China, with seven
times the population. Japan is expected
soon to rank as the world’s third-
strongest economic power, trailing only
the United States and the Soviet Union.
Along with this dramatic economic
surge, Japan will surely want to play
a greater role both diplomatically and
militarily in maintaining the balance in
Asia. As the Prime Minister of one
neighboring country put it: “The Japan-
ese are a great people, and no great
people will accept as their destiny mak-
ing better transistor radios and teach-
ing the underdeveloped how to grow
better rice.”
This greater role will entail, among
other things, a modification of the
present terms of the Japanese Con-
stitution, which specifically provides
that “land, sea, and air forces, as well
as other war potential, will never be
maintained.” (Japan’s 275,000 men
presently under arms are called “Self-
Defence Forces.”) Twenty years ago
it was considered unthinkable that
Japan should acquire even a con-
ventional military capability. Five
years ago, while some Japanese thought
about it, they did not talk about it.
Today a substantial majority of Jap-
anese still oppose the idea, but it is
openly discussed and debated. Look-
ing toward the future, one must recog-
nise that it simply is not realistic to
expect a nation moving into the first
rank of major powers to be totally
dependent for its own security on
another nation, however close the ties.
Japan’s whole society has been re-
structured since World War 11. While
there still'are traces of fanaticism, its
politics at least conform to the demo-
cratic ideal. Not to trust Japan today
with its own armed forces and with re-
sponsibility for its own defence would
be to place its people and its govern-
ment under a disability which, whatever
its roots in painful recent history, ill
accords with the role Japan must play
in helping secure the common safety
of non-communist Asia.
Any American policy toward Asia
must come urgently to grips with the
reality of China. This does not mean,
as many would simplistically have it,
rushing to grant recognition to Peking,
to admit it to the United Nations, and
to ply it with offers of trade all of
which would serve to confirm its rulers
in their present course. It does mean
recognising the present and potential
danger from Communist China, and
taking measures designed to meet that
danger. It also means distinguishing
carefully between long-range and short-
range policies, and fashioning short-
range programs so as to advance our
long-range goals.
Taking the long view, we simply can-
not afford to leave China for ever out-
side the family of nations, there to
nurture its fantasies, cherish its hates,
and threaten its neighbors. There is no
place on this small planet for a billion
of its potentially most able people to
live in angry isolation. But we could
go disastrously wrong if, in pursuing
this long-range goal, we failed in the
short range to read the lessons of his-
tory.
The world cannot be safe until China
changes. Thus our aim, to the extent
that we can influence events, should be
to induce change. The way to do this
is to persuade China that it must
change: that it cannot satisfy its im-
perial ambitions, and that its own
national interest requires a turning
away from foreign adventuring and a
turning inward toward the solution of
its own domestic problems.
If the challenge posed by the Soviet
Union after World War II was not pre-
cisely similar, it was sufficiently so to
offer a valid precedent and a valuable
lesson. Moscow finally changed when
it, too, found that change was neces-
sary. This was essentially a change of
the head, not of the heart. Internal
evolution played a role, to be sure, but


the key factor was that the West was
able to create conditions notably in
the shoring up of European defences,
the rapid restoration of European
economies, and the cementing of the
Atlantic Alliance that forced Mos-
cow to look to the wisdom of reach-
ing some measure of accommodation
with the West. We are still far from
reaching a full detente, but at least
substantial progress has been made.
During the next decade the West
faces two prospects which, together,
could create a crisis of the first order:
(1) that the Soviets may reach nuclear
parity with the United States; and (2)
that China, within three to five years,
will have a significant deliverable nu-
clear capability and that this same
China will be outside any non-prolifer-
ation treaty that might be signed, free,
if it chooses, to scatter its weapons
among “liberation” forces anywhere in
the world.
This heightens the urgency of build-
ing buffers that can keep the major
nuclear powers apart in the case of
“wars of national liberation,” supported
by Moscow or Peking but fought by
proxy. It also requires that we now
assign to the strengthening of non-
communist Asia a priority comparable
to that which we gave to the strength-
ening of Western Europe after World
War 11.
Some counsel conceding to China a
“sphere of influence” embracing much
of the Asian mainland and extending
even to the island nations beyond;
others urge that we eliminate the threat
by pre-emptive war. Clearly, neither of
these courses would be acceptable to
the United States or to its Asian allies.
Others argue that we should seek an
anti-Chinese alliance with European
powers, even including the Soviet
Union. Quite apart from the obvious
problems involved in Soviet partici-
pation, such a course would inevitably
carry connotations of Europe v. Asia,
white v. non-white, which could have
catastrophic repercussions throughout
the rest of the non-white world in
general and Asia in particular. If our
long-range aim is to pull China back
Into the family of nations, we must
avoid the impression that the great
powers or the European powers are
“ganging up.” The response should
clearly be one of active defence rather
than potential offence, and must be un-
tainted with any suspicion of racism.
For the United States to go it alone
in containing China would not only
place an unconscionable burden on our
own country, but also would heighten
the chances of nuclear war while under-
cutting the independent development of
the nations of Asia. The primary re-
straint on China’s Asian ambitions
should be exercised by the Asian nations
in the path of those ambitions, backed
by the ultimate power of the United
States. This is sound strategically, sound
psychologically, and sound in terms of
the dynamics of Asian development.
Only as the nations of non-communist
Asia become so strong —economically,
politically, and militarily that they
no longer furnish tempting targets for
Chinese aggression, will the leaders in
Peking be persuaded to turn their
energies inward rather than outward.
And that will be the time when the
dialogue with mainland China can
begin.
For the short run, then, this means
a policy of firm restraint, of no reward,
of a creative counterpressure designed
to persuade Peking that its interests
can be served only by accepting the
basic rules of international civility. For
the long run, it means pulling China
back into the world community but
as a great and progressing nation, not
as the epicentre of world revolution.
“Containment without isolation” is a
good phrase and a sound concept, as
far as it goes. But it covers only half
the problem. Along with it, we need
a positive policy of pressure and per-
suasion, of dynamic detoxification, a
marshalling of Asian forces both to
keep the peace and to help draw off
the poison from the Thoughts of Mao.
Dealing with Red China is some-
thing like trying to cope with the more
explosive ghetto elements in our own
country. In each case a potentially
destructive force has to be curbed; in
each case an outlaw element has to be
brought within the law; in each case
dialogues have to be opened; in each
case aggression has to be restrained
while education proceeds; and, not least,
in neither case can we afford to let
those now self-exiled from society stay
exiled for ever. We have to proceed
with both an urgency born of necessity
and a patience born of realism, moving
step by calculated step toward the
final goal.
And finally, the role of the United
States.
Weary with war, disheartened with
allies, disillusioned with aid, dismayed
at domestic crises, many Americans are
heeding the call of the new isolationism.
And they are not alone; there is a ten-
dency in the whole Western world to
turn inward, to become parochial and
isolationist dangerously so. But there
can be neither peace nor security a
generation hence unless we recognise
now the massiveness of the forces at
work in Asia, where more than half the
world’s people live and where the
greatest explosive potential is lodged.
Out of the wreckage of two world
wars we forged a concept of an Atlan-
tic community, within which a ravaged
Europe was rebuilt and the westward
advance of the Soviets contained. If
tensions now strain that community,
these are themselves a by-product of
success. But history has its rhythms, and
now the focus of both crisis and change
is shifting. Without turning our backs
on Europe, we have now to reach out
westward to the East, and to fashion the
sinews of a Pacific community.
This has to be a community in the
fullest sense: a community of purpose,
of understanding, and of mutual assis-
tance, in which military defences are
co-ordinated while economies are
strengthened; a community embracing a
concert of Asian strengths as a counter-
force to the designs of China; one in
which Japan will play an increasing
role, as befits its commanding position
as a world economic power; and one in
which U.S. leadership is exercised with
restraint, with respect for our partners,
and with a sophisticated discretion that
ensures a genuinely Asian idiom and
Asian origin for whatever new Asian
institutions are developed.
In a design for Asia’s future, there
is no room for heavy-handed American
pressures; there is need for subtle
encouragement of the kind of Asian
initiatives that help bring the design to
reality. The distinction may seem super-
ficial, but, in fact, it is central both
to the kind of Asia we want and to the
effectiveness of the means of achieving
it. The central pattern of the future in
U.S.-Asian relations must be American
support for Asian initiatives.
The industrial revolution has shown
that mass abundance is possible, and
as the United States moves into the
post-industrial world the age of
computers and cybernetics we have
to find ways to engineer an escape
from privation for those now living in
mass poverty. There can be no security,
whatever our nuclear stockpiles, in a
world of boiling resentment and magni-
fied envy. The oceans provide no
sanctuary for the rich, no barrier
to hide our abundance.
The struggle for influence in the
Third World is a three-way race
among Moscow, Peking, and the West.
The West has offered both idealism and
example, but the idealism has often
been unconvincing and the example
non-idiomatic. However, an industrial-
ised Japan demonstrates the economic-
ally possible in Asian terms, while an
advancing Asia tied into a Pacific com-
munity offers a bridge to the under-
developed elsewhere. During this final
third of the twentieth century, the
great race will be between man and
change: the race to control change,
rather than be controlled by it. In this
race we cannot afford to wait for others
to act, and then merely react. And the
race in Asia is already under way.

BOOKS
American Radicalism: a manual
for our Treason Kids
By PETER COLEMAN
The New Radicals. Paul Jacobs and
Saul Landau. A Pelican Original. $1.30.
THIS ESSAY and anthology is use-
ful mainly as a guide to the inspiration
of much contemporary student politics
—the American “Movement” or coali-
tion of 57 varieties of radicalism whose
main causes are Vietnam, Civil Rights,
poverty, and universities, whose
prophet is the late C. Wright Mills,
whose hero is Castro, and whose doc-
trine is . . . well, hatred of “liberal
rhetoric” and of the Welfare State.
Like all American ideological books,
it is hard to read, since Americans use
commonplace words like “conservatism”
and “radicalism” in special ways. For
them conservatism is something based
on a peculiar American mixture of ex-
treme business individualism, on the
legacy of a small man’s frontier, on
segregationist traditions, on a classic
puritanism, on gigantic big business.
There are no real counterparts to these
in Australia, where conservatism draws
on different sources. Similarly Ameri-
can radicals use what amounts to a
different language when they attack
American conservative citadels which do
not exist here, or at least are far
weaker here. The Aboriginal question
just can’t be related to the Negro
issue—perhaps it could be to the Red
Indian issue in America, but only a few
radicals are interested in that. For all
our “affluence,” it is fairly small
potatoes by American standards, and
you don’t arouse much interest in this
country by denouncing our over-fed,
over-paid, over-comfortable masses or
by organising demonstrations against
welfare Socialism in the name of exis-
tential humanism. Nor do our inter-
national commitments altogether sug-
gest a determination in Canberra to
dominate the world. The Australian
radical has a different row to hoe.
Nevertheless, the book is bound to
be read here, since the inspiration for
Australia’s Treason Kids is American,
and they are bound to draw ideas from
this anthology, however irrelevant. But
the interesting thing the book suggests
is the confusion in “The Movement,” a
feeling that “The Movment” has
already exhausted itself. Members of
“The Movement” despise “liberal
rhetoric,” but feel they have as yet
little but a counter-rhetoric to offer;
they despise organisation because it
means bureaucracy, but feel that un-
less they organise they are limiting
their activities to gimmicks, demonstra-
tions, stunts. They talk about the need
for an “ideology,” but recognise that
ideology divides, whereas their need is
for some point of unity.
They at least are vocal about what
they are against. “The Movement”
rejects the career and life styles of the
American liberal; in fact, to “The
Movement” the liberal way of life and
frame of mind is “the evil of America.”
Liberals, they believe, have substituted
empty rhetoric for significant content,
obscured the principle of justice by
administrative bureaucracy, sacrificed
human values for efficiency, and hypo-
critically justified a brutal attempt to
establish American hegemony over the
world with sterile anti-Communism.
“ ‘The Movement’ sees the liberals
righteously proclaiming faith in
American democracy from their com-
fortable suburban homes or offices,
while the United States Air Force drops
napalm on villages and poisons the rice
paddies.” For “The Movement,” the
late President Kennedy, an arch-liberal,
was little better than Hitler. (After
all, he supported U.S. commitments
to freedom in Vietnam and made
Khrushchev take his missiles away
from Cuba!)
But the New Values they preach are
Fidel Castro... no liberal rhetoric
far from clear; members, of course,
“make it” inter-racially, acknowledge
and overcome their sense of difference
between black and white races. That
much is elementary. They are also
anti-cool: sincerity and honesty are
everything. At a convention in Michi-
gan, one student “spoke” for 45 min-
utes “an inarticulate highly gesticu-
lating presentation which emphasised
‘gutting with people’.” They are
students, yet they despise the standards
of intellectual excellence. But above
all they have their causes: poverty,
Vietnam, free universities, Negro
rights.
Yet their achievements so far have
not been great. It has been the “con-
temptible” Johnson Administration, not
“The Movement,” that has done most
for Negro civil rights, and even there
not much has been done: Freedom-
Riders and their descendants can claim
credit for hitting Jim Crow in lunch
counters, swimming-pools, bus ter-
minals, and libraries, but, as Bayard
Rustin points out, it is in these fields
that segregation was anachronistic and
dispensable anyhow. Negro soldiers in
Vietnam are doing far more for Negro
rights in America than all “The Move-
ment’s” adherents put together.
At the same time “The Movement”
has attracted huge numbers of the
“wrong type,” who have to be purged.
It has attracted, according to the writers
of this book, too many “beats,” “kooks,”
and “potheads,” too many young Negro
hangers-on who have nothing to do
except “harass white women, mooch
money, drink, and sing, demoralising
office staff and making it difficult for
the spirit of Negro-white units to mean
more than words”; too many Com-
munists interested only in manipulating
“The Movement.” Above all, they have
helped produce an unexpected by-
John Kennedy. .. arch-liberal


product: black Fascism and anti-
Semitism.
Yet without the “Movement” bums,
the Communists and the black Fascists,
the remnant would become either a
collection of study groups (which
wouldn’t do them any harm) or be
forced to join with the rest of us
despised liberals in social reform. But
there are not many kicks in that.

20th-Century Australian Literary Criti-
cism. Clement Semmler. Oxford Uni-
versity Press. $6.50.
LITERARY CRITICISM in Australia
has suffered from divided aims and
from the lack of a clearly defined
audience. The need to justify, and even
simply to encourage, Australian writing
and the reading of Australian books
meant that critics and commentators
tended to write with one eye on the
text and the, other on the public they
had to attract. This lack of adequate
audience and adequate response
accounts for the uncertainty that has
marred much critical discussion here;
it also partly accounts for the failure
of certain talents to develop to the
full.
Divided aims have afflicted Austra-
lian writers and critics in many ways.
Many of them have been the victims
of forces they could not change, even
if they understood them. They have
either identified themselves too closely
with an inferior local tradition or else
have remained isolated in an indiffer-
ent environment where their main
strengths were those of rejection.
There is still a fairly widespread
failure to understand the literary past
and the particular pressures that
writers have had to contend with.
Low’s Stephens... relevance
Clement Semmler ... sources
There is an understandable reluctance
to look back in much detail, and noth-
ing takes more time and energy and
patience to read than second-rate
writing.
This is not new. Archibald Strong’s
pontifical survey of Australian Litera-
ture, published in 1913, was ill-informed
and random in its references, though
“sound” in most of its general state-
ments. Label the whole thing colonial
and express confidence in better things
to come and you can’t go wrong.
The validity of these remarks can be
tested against Clement Semmler’s new
compilation - in many ways a disap-
pointing book. Disappointing because it
is neither adequately historical nor
fully representative. I can think of five
or six critics, from John Barnes to
Leonie Kramer, who should have been
included. The thirty pages devoted to
Frank Robb on “Adam Lindsay Gor-
don’s debt to English literature” are
an indulgence, given the task that Mr.
Semmler had; and then, generally, he
hasn’t gone very far afield for his
material.
Nearly all of the essays Semmler in-
cludes are easily accessible; and one of
the most interesting sources for the
development of modern Australian
criticism, the newspaper columns of the
’2os and ’3os, is left untapped. In
fact, the writers of those years are
ignored and many of them are bigger
talents than Will Ogilvie, Roderic
Quinn, and Bernard O’Dowd, so that
we are deprived of significant segments
of our literary development, in spite
of the title’s suggestion of a vast in-
clusiveness.
Nevertheless, Clement Semmler has
gathered together some items of real and
sometimes great interest. To follow his
book through from, say, Lionel Lindsay
on McCrae to the later comments is to
trace a pattern of development in critical
writing that was universal. Fanciful
belles-lettres were as common in France
and England in 1909 as here. We need
to place these things historically; and
while this doesn’t make them better, it
helps us to discriminate by seeing them
in perspective. It is part of A. G.
Stephens’ strength that he was able to
cut through the period gentilities to
give his criticism permanent relevance.
Semmler’s approach is properly plura-
listic. In Section 2, “The Critics,* the
outstanding articles are, in their dif-
ferent ways, those on Lawson and A. D.
Hope, while the study of “Sound in
Slessor’s Poetry” is an exercise in a
mode too infrequently attempted here.
Slessor is a poet of exceptional verbal
texture (verbal texture inseparable from
meaning) and this piece draws atten-
tion to features often overlooked in
his work.
The best section is Part 3, “The
Poets as Critics.” One is unlikely to
agree with all that Judith Wright says
about Baylebridge or that Slessor says
about McCrae, but a special interest in-
forms these pieces by virtue of their
authorship. Some of the items, for in-
stance, those by James McAuley and
Chris Wallace-Crabbe, demonstrate the
dictum that nearly all good literary
criticism is topical and occasional.
It is worthy of note (the editor does
not record it) that many of the best of
these essays were first delivered in uni-
versities as Commonwealth Literary
Fund lectures. Of the nine contributions
in Part 3, about six were used in this
way. This fact alone tells us much
about the development of Australian
criticism over the past 25 years.
A master
By JOHN BAXTER
The Music School. John Updike. Andre
Deutsch. Price $3.15.
AS WE MIGHT have expected, Up-
dike’s new book of short stories exhibits
the agreeable combination of style and
insight which has distinguished all his
work. Undoubtedly one of modern
fiction’s most competent masters of
literary technique, his writing in this
collection of twenty “New Yorker”
stories from the past five years shows
him working at the very limits of
formal style, exploring the possibilities
of more intricate construction and
greater concentration of meaning as
authors like Burroughs are examining
the opposite extremes. Some of these
tests are failures, albeit honorable ones,
but the best of them suggest new fields
of fictional technique at least as excit-
ing as those opened up by the more
advanced destroyers of conventional
structure.
There are stories in “The Music
School” from every phase of Updike’s
artistic development. “In Football
Season” relates to the small-town
chronicles of his novels, but his obser-
vation of college life is only a brief
footnote to the more meticulous recol-
lection of his young manhood in a
country town which sustained “The
Poorhouse Fair” and “The Centaur.”
This is the first and oldest story in the
book; following it, the tone becomes
darker, the surface more complex.

Updike does not abandon the rural
background which is so central to his
work, but in stories like “The Indian”
and “Harv Is Plowing Now” he tests
and distorts it, as if hoping to find
in less strictly recorded reality a new
truth.
Occasionally he succeeds, especially
when he is able to combine these
memoirs of country life with one or
more of the techniques which he used
to effect in his earlier short stories, as
“Harv Is Plowing Now” introduces
dissimilar subjects into a story in order
to draw parallels between similarity of
response or emotion. His comparison
between the mechanics of archaeology
and his own remembrance of childhood
is especially successful, indicating in-
triguing possibilities in the juxtaposition
and blending of subject and background
which other writers might use to advan-
tage.
Despite the beauty and assurance of
most stories in “The Music School,”
one is struck by the unease which
motivates many of them. From his first
work as a serious writer, Updike was
marked by an almost dewy innocence
of vision.
The innocence of these early works
is not often present in this collection,
with its pitiless depictions of obsession,
loneliness, and alienation. Many of the
stories seek, for what one must presume
are personal reasons, a hint of romance
in a ruined relationship, or embark on
painful periods of self-laceration at the
real or imagined failure of a man to
communicate with the woman he loves.
“Giving Blood” has a couple achieving
a brief understanding while the husband
is dazed from donating blood: “Twin
Beds In Rome,” particularly disturbing,
shows the precise instant of a marriage
falling apart, an insight as unentertain-
ing as the glimpse of an open wound.
It is “Leaves,” however, with its terse
and half-hysterical imagery, that shows
Updike’s furthest exploration of this
subject and the book’s greatest degree
of penetration. One has the sense of
a story written in the extreme of per-
sonal disturbance, of a world glimpsed
in flashes of lightning.
Stories like “Leaves” occasionally
seem too personal. One is disturbed
by their compression, the revealing
nature of their content. Has too much
been said? Updike himself seems to
doubt the desirability of making the
most intimate emotions the subject of
fiction, and many of his stories deal
in detail with the precise mechanics by
which a moment of insight occurs
rather than the insight itself. It is
almost as if the arrogation of magic
moments, which is the short-story
writer’s stock in trade, has met in
Updike its first critic. One of the most
moving stories in this collection, “The
Hermit,” shows, as did “The Crow In
The Woods” in “Pigeon Feathers,” the
process of enlightenment interrupted by
the intrusion of ignorant outside forces,
while “Four Sides of One Story” dis-
sects to the extinction of all romance
a great love story. In each case, one
senses an uncharacteristic doubt, a
determination to test the limits to which
one can go without destroying the
writer’s reason for existence, the record-
ing of truth.
That one is able to examine a short
story collection in terms of its fidelity to
pure truth is an index to the superlative
skill, even genius, of the author. John
Updike may fall occasionally from the
high standard he has set himself, but
even his failures are peaks above the
work, of any other writer in this field.
His is a style as complex and com-
petent as any modern literature has
produced; clear, sharp, a model for any
writer. No professional author can fail
to read this collection without learning
all over again the flexibility of the
English language, no careful reader put
it down who has not at least once been
moved by an illumination of his own
existence.
Lowell's leap
By VIVIAN SMITH
Near The Ocean. Robert Lowell. Faber.
$3.05.
ROBERT LOWELL’S lapse from
Catholicism seems to have coin-
cided with the great stylistic changes
that “Life Studies” announced in his
work. This is not surprising, since
technical changes are usually associated
with emotional and imaginative changes
as technical limitations are associ-
ated with failures of imaginative daring
and grip. The subtlety, though, with
which Lowell registers these things is
part of his great power as a poet.
“Near The Ocean” could be called
something of an interim report, if such
a description didn’t somehow diminish
its admirable force as a whole. It con-
tains seven personal poems and six
translations, of which the version of
Juvenal’s Tenth Satire “The Vanity of
Human Wishes” and the Brunetto
Latini Canto from the “Inferno” are
outstanding. Written with characteris-
tic energy and the weight of contem-
porary speech, they are both very im-
pressive poems. Lowell needs to appro-
priate the poets of the past to enrich
the contents of his work with living
and varied matter that would only
otherwise be available to him as pas-
tiche and with all the deadness that
that implies or else as a kind of
Eliotic collage. That Lowell’s method
is the most fruitful, as well as the oldest
and most conventional solution, seems
to me to be beyond doubt.
This book will be welcomed, too, for
the sequence beginning with “Walking
Early Sunday Morning” and “Fourth
of July in Maine.” Only lengthy quota-
tion could do justice to these pieces
which explore the need for and the
nature of experience and the spirit’s
longing for essential innocence “O
that the spirit could remain, tinged but
untarnished by its strain”; the need to
Robert Lowell . . . changes
balance order and disorder, freedom
and control; while the poem to Harriet
Winslow becomes, in part, a Yeatsian
(or perhaps Jonsonian) celebration of
the nature of identity through posses-
sions (“friends, independence, and a
house”). These poems have more
than one undertone that places them
fully in the centre of our own immedi-
ate world:
Pity the planet, all joy gone
from this sweet volcanic cone;
peace to our children when they fall
in small war on the heels of small
war —until the end of time
to police the earth, a ghost
orbiting forever lost
in our monotonous sublime.

COOKBOOK
No one will beef
about these
vegetarian meals
WHEN WE WERE first married we
met a young couple whose company
we enjoyed very much but whose
dinner parties we always dreaded. They
professed to be vegetarians and, regular
as clockwork, we could count on cauli-
flower au gratin, or nut cutlets. As
we enjoyed their company (if not their
diet) it became our custom to have a
hearty snack before leaving home for
their flat.
After a sojourn abroad our return
to England was heralded with an invi-
tation to dinner at their flat. As usual,
we ate a hearty meal first. Perhaps you
can visualise our horror when we were
confronted with a handsome roast.
Their improved financial state had per-
suaded them to give up being vege-
tarians! I am passionately fond of vege-
tables myself, and I respect immensely
those people who believe that eating
animals is barbaric . . . but it had
never occurred to me that one can
produce dishes at the haute cuisine
level on a strictly vegetarian basis.
My ideas have been drastically
changed since reading a book called
“New Food For All Palates,” by Sally
and Lucian Berg. Published by Victor
Gollancz, it is now obtainable in Aus-
tralia for $3.60. This fascinating book
will provide us (non-vegetarians) with
many months of new gastronomic
experiences. It gives recipes from Eng-
land, Italy, the Mediterranean coun-
tries, Central Europe, and the Near
East. Whether you are a vegetarian
or not, this is one book you will enjoy
reading and find extremely useful and
interesting.
Too often eating “vegetarian” meals
just meant adapting dishes and leaving
out the meat. In this book you will
find dishes that are well worth crack-
ing a bottle of vintage wine for. There
is practically no limit to the variety of
ways in which new tastes can be
achieved. There are casseroles, soups,
salads, appetisers, and spreads of every
description.
At the beginning of the book is a
list of “unfamiliar” foods which you
will find stimulating and interesting. It
deals with things like aubergines, sea-
weed, and sesame seeds and many
other flavors and spices that you may
never have thought of using. Sesame
seeds are not yet very familiar to us
in Australia, but are widely used in
the East and around the Eastern
Mediterranean. One of my own favor-
ite uses for them and not listed in
this book is as an addition to a
simple lettuce salad. Two tablespoons
of sesame seeds lightly fried in butter
until golden add a delicious nutty flavor
to the salad.
This book contains a recipe for
Acorda which brought back memories
to me. I once shared a house in Spain
with a girl who got terrible hangovers.
She used to appear at breakfast time
with her eyes almost shut, feel her
way into the kitchen, and begin to
peel and chop garlic. She would bring
about ljj pints of water to the boil
with about of wholemeal bread
(crusts removed). Then she would add
half a complete head of garlic, finely
chopped, 2 teaspoons of salt and some
black pepper. This would be simmered
until the bread was mushy. It would
then be put into a sieve and pressed
through into the saucepan, and re-
heated. Then she would pour it into
a bowl and sit down at the table to
eat it. Gradually her eyes opened and
she became human once more! Try
Acorda adjusting the amount of
garlic if you have difficult friends.
There is a recipe for Pain Perdu
Quebecois which intrigued me so much
that I tried it. It is listed as a break-
fast dish but I am not that keen
on Cointreau or Grand Marnier at
that time of day, so we had it one
Sunday afternoon.
For 6-8 slices of good white bread
you will require the following: Cut
razor-thin slices of lemon and orange,
leaving the peel on. Divide into quar-
ters. Put on a small plate, immerse in
good liqueur (Cointreau or Grand
Marnier is recommended). Break 2
eggs into a bowl, add 2-3 tablespoons
of cream. Beat well. Heat 2 table-
spoons of olive oil in a frying-pan. Dip
each slice of bread quickly but
thoroughly into the egg mixture and
fry until golden brown on both sides.
Drain. (Add more oil from time to
time as necessary.) Put the crisp fried
bread on hot plates, decorate each slice
with plenty of soaked fruit slices (plus
remaining liqueur), and drench the lot
with maple syrup. Good with coffee.
It seems to me that there are vege-
tarians and vegetarians. Some abstain
from animal food altogether, and there
are some who take it in the form of
milk, eggs, butter and cheese. This
book caters for both.
Many people strongly believe that
our health suffers from the eating of
flesh, and that high morality and a
keen intellect are achieved by keeping
to a simple diet. I am quiet prepared
to believe it, and it may have worked
for Bernard Shaw but I’m afraid I
just couldn’t live without an occasional
piece of beef!


How to appreciate
the beauty, function & quality
of a Brownbuilt desk...
The purchase of your office desk
is like buying a new car;
it reflects your position and your
good taste. It must be highly
functional. It must blend in style
and colour with the office decor.
It must be pleasing to the eye from
your side (and client’s side).
It must be a pleasure to work at.
Brownbuilt realises that a desk
is more than a flat top
held up by drawers.
That’s why there are more than
1,600 different Desk, Credenza
and Table configurations
in the contemporary Brownbuilt
Fliteline series, and hundreds
of alternative combinations in the
more traditional Spaceline series.
All are guaranteed 5 years and
are specially treated
to resist rust, too.
The Fliteline and Spacelineseries
provide you with an office setting
entirely tailored to your taste.
If you want a desk of distinction,
that’s functional and of the
highest quality, come and see it

Are teachers overpaid?
Brian Buckley, in his article “Teach-
ers —a crisis in esteem” (8., Sept. 30),
made one mistake when he assumed
that teachers are professionals in the
same sense that doctors and lawyers
are. Teachers are no more professionals
than Customs inspectors or taxation
officials these are the occupations
with which teaching should be com-
pared.
We should follow New York’s
example and demand Master’s De-
grees from secondary schoolteachers and
then pay them accordingly, but, con-
versely, the teachers in primary and
infants’ schools are, in my opinion,
grossly overpaid, as their work con-
sists of no more than supervision, and
these teachers are among those Mr.
Buckley compares with doctors and
dentists; the receptionists of the latter
would make a more apt comparison.
There should be, I feel, a more dis-
tinct division between the masters, or
“professionals,” and the junior teach-
ers, and a much wider salary range.
This in itself would encourage teachers
to work harder toward promotion and
to compensate a possible shortage in
the junior primary departments the
minimum standard set for these teach-
ers could be relaxed to such a level that
the balance was restored.

Poetry—Rocking the boat
With regard to my Forum article “Aus-
tralian Poetry—Nobody’s Rocking the
Boat” (8., Sept. 16) and the letters it
provoked from Thomas W. Shapcott
and Martin Haley (8., Sept. 30), I
think that only these points deserve
comment.
Firstly, I certainly didn’t claim to be
“in” with anybody: Gwen Harwood
has corresponded with a good many
writers, Mr. Shapcott himself included,
and he should know that she saw some
things wrong with Australian poetry
including “skunky pentameters” be-
fore anybody. I didn’t say that friends
shouldn’t write to one another: quite a
number of poets I know enjoy reading
Mr. Shapcott’s letters.
Secondly, I hadn’t meant to give the
impression of “dismissing Francis
Webb” and, in fact, would include him
among the few really interesting poets
of the past dozen years. My remark
about his conservatism “in his choice of
stanza patterns” followed my praise of
Kenneth Slessor’s “South Country,”
which I said is “very ‘traditional’ in


HEADMISTRESS
TINTERN CEGGS
RINGWOOD EAST, VICTORIA
(Re-advertised)
Applications are invited, not later than
31st October, 1967, for the position of
resident Headmistress of Tintern CEGGS,
to be vacated by the retirement of Miss
C. M. Wood; appointment will be pre-
ferably from September, 1968, or, at
latest, January, 1969. The school is
situated in the suburb of Ringwood, about
17 miles from the centre of Melbourne,
and offers education from primary to
matriculation level, to approximately 540
girls, of whom about 60 are boarders.
The buildings are modern, and are
situated in grounds of 50 acres.
Salary will be determined according
to the selected applicant's qualifications
and experience, plus accommodation,
allowances and superannuation.
Applicants, who should be graduates of
a recognised University and communi-
cant members of the Church of England,
can obtain further information from the
Bursar, Tintern CEGGS, Victoria Street,
Ringwod East, Victoria. Application,
giving in the first instance details of
age, marital and university status, should
be made by 21st October, 1967, to the
Chairman of the School Council, the
Right Reverend F. R. Arnott, St. Paul's
Cathedral Buildings, Flinders Lane, Mel-
bourne, Victoria.
stanzaic and metrical form,” and my
point that the good poetry I look for is
“not necessarily connected with innovat-
ing techniques.” Also, I thought that the
comment on Mr. Webb’s poetry was
qualified by my phrase about “the
modernism of his texture.”
Thirdly, Mr. Shapcott asked whether
I have “talked with any young Aus-
tralian poets lately”: the answer is yes.
One wrote to me recently, sending
some good poems —and, incidentally,
describing Mr. Shapcott as “shining
one hell of a light on the poetic scene,”
if it’s any comfort to him. Young poets
I’ve talked to recently did me the
honor of praising my article and saying
it was long overdue. This, however,
has made me feel guilty about not
mentioning good younger poets, though
there aren’t many, it seems, getting
published. Mr. Haley, 1 think, has a
point here, when he writes, in connec-
tion with “our anthologies,” about “Few
avenues of publication” being “open,
and these . . . mostly selective on a
narrow basis.” However, Andrew Tay-
lor has got some impressive, even ex-
citing, poems into magazines. Tim Bass
has published a few good poems, if I
may offer one more example.
Mr. Shapcott claims that. I “tend to
side-track . . . with (sometimes justi-
fied) complaints about lack of experi-
ment.” In fact, my main complaint is
about “lack of experiment” and about
what I called “stubborn conservatism.”
Perhaps I should have italicised that
word “stubborn.” My objection to the
“discursive mode” is that it encourages
what I termed “the characteristic Aus-
tralian vice of restatement or even
repetition” in poetry and a “declama-
tory slackness.” Poetry that “doesn’t
waste a single word” gains a concen-
trated intensity, gains excitement, and
gives pleasure. So much Australian
poetry is simply dull. I didn’t write
my essay, as Mr. Shapcott believes I
did, because boat-rocking is “great fun”:
I wrote out of the firm and angry
belief that reading the verse written in
one’s own country shouldn’t have to
be a grim sort of aesthetic, patriotic
duty.
I must confess to two sins of omis-
sion. I did that fine poet Vincent
Buckley less than justice in my one
sentence about his “increasing stature.”
Also, I should have identified Rodney
Hall, once a young poet of outstanding
promise and now, as Poetry Editor of
“The Australian,” the leading spokes-
man for “The Poetic Establishment’s
Younger Set”: who helped to “tie a
label, " a political one, on Mr. Buckley.

Tariffs and immigration
Alan Reid quite rightly emphasises
(8., Sept. 16) the importance to Aus-
tralia of a Tariff Policy that recog-
nises the significance of an effective
immigration program.
Whilst not wishing to detract from
the splendid service given to Australia
by Arthur Calwell as Minister for
Immigration, it is worth remembering
that he was supported by a. strong
Cabinet, the members of which realised
fully the significance of all that was
involved in the Labor Party’s policy
of full employment. Chifley, in my
own personal experience of the man
during the war and after, demonstrated
in his typical realistic manner his be-
lief in Australian industry and in the
effective protection of Australian stan-
dards of living through proper tariffs.
Furthermore, the Labor Government
had the benefit of first-class advisers
in the economic field, who, in my ex-
perience, were content to advise the
Government. They did not seek to
take from the Government its right
to make policy decisions on matters
like tariffs.
The Menzies-McEwen coalition fol-
lowed on in the same manner and with
similar success. As Menzies emphasised
in his speech when tabling the Vernon
Committee Report, a Government can-
not leave policy-making to a com-
mittee.
It seems to me now that there is
very great pressure on politicians to
permit their policy-making powers to
be usurped by boards and committees.
So far, McEwen has been able to keep
the present Government on the rails
but the pressure continues. It will
be interesting to see who, in the ranks
of the young men coming up through
the Liberal Party, the Country Party,
and the Labor Party, will have the
courage, as well as the opportunity, to
assert the right of a Government to
govern.
In this connection it is interesting
to note that Cairns, when speaking in
the House on September 21, made
it clear that “the Opposition, in Gov-
ernment, would not necessarily accept
the Tariff Board’s recommendations . . .
and that the responsibility of sometimes
bringing in a different decision from
that recommended by the Tariff Board
is one that ought to be openly faced
and accepted.”

What reviewers should tell
Peter Gough’s attempt to “place” Aus-
tralia's pitifully few good novelists
(8., Oct. 7) in first, second, and third
positions may be suitable to the
national sporting outlook but hardly
seems so in literary criticism. It could
lead to a climate similar to the racing
charts in which a tipsters’ poll heads
the page, with each expert picking them
in different order—and very often all
being wrong.
Not so very long ago other tipsters
than Peter Gough had Mathers high on
their lists, and, earlier, Stow. Whether
C is better than B or A surely is not
important? Whether any of them can
be said to have entered the pitifully
small company of better Australian
novelists may be important to the
reader who might be considering buy-
ing the book.
Most important of all to this same
reader whose money is in the balance
would be some idea of how the local
man, whether C, B, or A, stands in
relation to world authors; not, perhaps,
whether he is top- or middle-shelf, but
what he is worth in relation to authors
working similar ground elsewhere. This
is vital to those of us who like to
read and, not using lending libraries
for one reason or another, budget to
buy, say, one book a month. We can-
not afford too many “bum steers” in
any year from literary critics, so we
tend to play safe and, very often,
this means avoiding Australian books.
This view applies particularly to
writers, such as Keneally, who are
classed by reviewers as Catholic writ-
ers, whatever that means. I would take
it to mean that they deal with problems
of conscience on a Roman Catholic
level rather than a perhaps more nor-
mal catholic one. Graham Greene is
said to do that. How does Keneally
compare with him? Or with Morris
West? I, with my $3.15 in hand, am
not sure.
