ACCOUNTANCY
Young Man Qualify !
This is the age of spec : alisation. The Degree in Accountancy issued by
the Institutes of Accountants is now recognised by employers everywhere
as the hall-mark of efficiency for office men. To-day there are thousands
of good men of ability grinding away as clerks at low salaries, kept down
because they have not realised what to do to get ahead.
What Others are Doing
Up to July 31st, 1920, we have successfully trained in Australasia 6,765 men
as Accountants, Bookkeepers, Secretaries and Auditors. No fewer than 1,496
passed the recognised Accountancy Degree Examination last year under our
guidance, and 683 others of our men qualified as Bookkeepers, Municipal
Clerks and Secretaries. As we teach approximately half of the successful
candidates each year, it means that at least double the above number qualified
in the same period.
The man who plans to succeed as an Architect studies Architecture —the man
who plans to succeed as a Lawyer studies Law—likewise if you plan to succeed
in Business you must study Business Accountancy and Commercial Law.
Make up your mind NOW to win success and promotion
by qualification.

Our Illustrated Booklet “ACCOUNTANCY” tells you all about
our methods, shows you how to qualify, the time and cost, and all
information connected with the Accountancy Course.

never before come to the sea reached the end
ot their memorable ride:—
Afar we saw the shore-line loom:
Our horses, springing freely, strode:
And suddenly m purple gloom
The sea gave greeting as we rode..
We galloped on, nor ever ceased
till gloriously in golden tire
The sun uprose, and in the east
We reached the goal of our desire.
We pushed our horses through the foam,
the breakers swirled about their knees;
And underneath the golden dome
We shouted to the Morning Seas.
All the spirit of the Sydney summer is in this :
If any care rankles —
Away ! and behold
Pink feet and white ankles
On beaches of gold.
And surf that runs after
To kiss clinging dresses,
And white teeth and laughter
And wild clinging tresses.

PINKETTES
A DAINTY LAXATIVE
The day of harsh purgatives, of
big cathartic pills is over —gone for
ever. No need any longer to
swallow a nauseating dose to give
nature the gentle assistance re-
quired. Pinkettes, the new laxative,
are little pink, sugar-coated ovals,
easy to take and pleasant in their
action. They are not drastic,
although certain and thorough.
Pinkettes are designed to
arouse the sluggish bowels and tor-
pid liver, to correct bad breath,
clear the complexion, and banish
biliousness and headache.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Red and White.
Ten lives ago I laughed at an old witch,
For red her eyes were and her lips were
pale;
Then did she brew the left ear of a bitch,
Two claws, a fish’s fin and one small snail,
And dance about the pot when day was
dead —
She cursed me three times three with
mocking laughter,
Vowing that gleaming white and glowing red
Should bring me haunting sorrow ever
after.
Now never does the sunset stain the sky
With heart’s-blood of some splendid cour-
tesan
Who stirred the hearts of kings, and had
to die
When her soft life had run its scarlet span ;
But strange regret moves in me and the
glory
Fades from the sky and leaves the wide
world grey,
Cold as the echo of the mouldered story
Of those bowed lips corrupted by the clay.
White is the moon and lonely, cold and
chaste,
Most gayly piteous and most piteous mad ;
I fear her pale round face and flee in haste,
And nought is in my love to make me
glad.
The moon is up—the mad moon weaves white
fingers,
The world is silver beauty, but I go,
Made wistful by some haunting fear that
lingers
From some forgotten dream I may not
know.
A white rose and a red rose nod and dance
■ And have no sorrow that their day is
brief;
So it is witchery and more than chance
That I am haunted by the fallen leaf,
And all the long-dead roses which have flung
Their hearts to ev’ry breeze and loved all-
comers,
Then crumbled into dust and slept among
The roses red and white of other summers.
Young lips are red and skins are palely
white:
Most magical are these when velvet skies
Wrap round the world in cloakings of soft
night;
So why be solemn, ah! and why be wise?
What though the colors fade beneath the
. touch
Of Time the dauber quick to stain their
shadings,
Why not rejoice—not troubled over-much
By musty thoughts of beauty’s flower
fading?
Yet red is sorrow, white is dull remorse,
Though each is beauty and is beauty’s hue;
The fire’s cheerful heart, a meteor’s course,
A foam-crest curling on a wave of blue,
Snow-mantled mountains yearning from the
earth.
Red-spangled windows of a sunset city—
Surely these things be rather for sweet
mirth
Than for the shadows of a ghost-grey pity!
The witch bound evil spells and bound them
strong.
Dancing upon the hill where rocks rose
stark ;
Her black curse haunts me like a ghhstly
song
Heard amid trees when night is vast and
dark.
In some far land and in another dav
I laughed to see a witch —a lad’s laugh
only;
She stole my joy in white and red away
And set a curse on me to make me lonely!

The Pot.
The water, tortured as it'boils,
Hurls bubbles upward in the pot.
Each bubble, restive, rolls and toils
Whilst at the base the fire is hot;
And when the greatest heat is there
The mightiest bubbles will appear.
Perchance each little bubble knows
Some reasoned creed of right or wrong,
Some little sense of joys or woes,
Or some ambition leaping strong,
As it its upward journey takes
To float a minute ere it breaks.
And some inflated bubble, raised
When hottest fires may burn below,
By its own magnitude amazed,
A dream imperial may know.
But, as for honors vast it thirsts,
It meets the outer air and bursts.
And some perchance a God may place
Beyond the margin of the pan,
A cause why hubbies toil and race
So madly in their little span;
And maybe right....for who knows what
Has lit the fires beneath the pot?
Some joys may haply lie within
The span twixt bubble-birth and ends.
Ah. virtuous bubbles shunning sin,
Assured that Heaven all bubbles sends.
What virtue in the upward toil.
If Hell should keep the pot a-boil?

THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT AND THE
MODERN POLITICIAN.
Most men who went to the war spent at
least one Christmas in the. line. Those who
served in Flanders will recall a tendency
amongst the weaker vessels to recapture the
traditional spirit of the season. After all,
they were Christians, Boche and Britisher
alike. “Sing to us, English !” cried the mis-
erable German privates across the snow of
No Man’s Land after they had sung
carols as familiar to London and Bir-
mingham as to Baden and Berlin.
The equally miserable Tommies complied,
and- there was what the medievalists called
“a truce of God” until the splendid crea-
tures who were making war in comfort and
security many miles away heard about it.
The, demonstrators were warned in Orders
against repeating the • offence. As a dis-
tracted poet, himself a fighting private,
wrote: —
He dared to think, but to think they told him was
treason. '
This little darkness would mean a larger light.
All beautiful things must perish—have tbdir night.
What world than a world of hate could be more
right ?
He was wrong, wrong, wrong, they told him, and
they were right.
What was the “larger light” which was pro-
mised to those who were risking all they
had? No one knew better than the political
and military chiefs that the illumination
must have an ethical basis if those con-
cerned were to be kept up to the collar.
And so the combatants learned that high
moral principles were at stake: that it was
a war for freedom, and against Prussian-
ism ; for self-determination and against pre-
datory nationalism; above all, that this war
would end wars. Nothing served to steel
the hand which sniped or bombed the carol-
ling Bocfae more than the reflection that
the musician’s death would help to make
the world friendlier and more righteous.
* * * *
That was years ago, and inter-racially
speaking things are worse than ever. Serbia
in a sense began the war. According to C.
Delisle Burns ("International Politics”),
kince the Armistice the Serbs have devas-
tated Montenegro and oppressed its people
and interned a commission sent to in-
quire.’ When the deposed King of Korea
oied in 1019 crowds gathered and speeches
were made in favor of independence. The
people had no weapons, but Japanese sol-
diers shot amongst them, killing, according
to the official Tokio report, 399. Some thou-
w r ere then arrested and their cry for
self-determination was stilled. The Ameri-
cans have just had trouble in their protec-
torate of Haiti, and have settled it on tne
blood-and-iron principle as before. Ireland
has had to be placed under martial law —
Ireland, which sent half-a-fiiillipn men to
fight against militarism —and millions of
pounds sterling and thousands of British
lives have been sacrificed in Mesopotamia,
partly, if not wholly, because the British
Government would not or could not keep
faith with the “Middle-Eastern” peoples who
stood by the Empire during the war. There
is a tremendous amount of machinery ex-
pressly designed to avert this sort of thing;
and that the different peoples—as peoples
if not as Governments —want it averted is
shown by the fact that the preventive
engines are there. Treaties, declarations,
arrangements, protocols, conventions, ratifi-
cations, proclamations—all are sops thrown
by diplomacy to nations hungry for the Christ-
mas spirit of peace and goodwill. It is hard to
fix the blame for international or inter-racial,
troubles, and the injustice and oppression
that ensue. The system of secret diplomacy
shields the politicians up to the moment of
the outbreak, and after that everybody, from
the Prime Minister down to tlie humblest
staff-officer, is shielded. Obscurantism be-
comes law. Whoever hints that there may
bo a case for the other side is a traitor.
Every prominent politician is officially a
statesman, and every general a skilful sol-
dier. Such fictions are maintained by legis-
lation for months, even years, after the
fighting has ended, probably for the reason
that if it weren’t so the wild justice of
assassination would be commoner in high
places than it is.
* * * *
We know more about our peace-time auto-
crats. They have to work to a certain
extent in the open. “Peace,” observed
Treitzschke, “is veiled warfare.” He meant
that the Powers are always “in the state and
posture of gladiators,” ever ready to strike
a blow for dignity or aggrandisement.- If
he had said, further, there are individuals
so constituted that they will always, where
possible, make a state of peace resemble
& state of war, the world would agree with
him in the light of modern experience.
These people talk Christianity and make
capital out of dissension. They apply the
methods of a nation in danger to periods
when no real peril is in sight; or no peril,
anyhow, which relates to their activities.
They foster at home the same racial class
and sectarian bitternesses which G.H.Q.
fostered in the trenches between Britishers
and Germans. The State is made as much
like a war-zone as possible. In the Kal-
goorlie election the Government issued a
manifesto which was a straight-out chal-
lenge to Irish racialism and the Roman
Catholic religion, neither of which has any
bearing on Australian politics. If a dozen
Maiions were defeated at by-elections it
would not injure Sinn Fein or trouble the
Papacy—though it would be very profitable,
of course, to Mr. Plugiies. They are fake
issues like the propaganda stories of the
boiling-down of corpses by the Germans for
fat; and their object is the same —to make
victory more certain by arousing sentiments
of anger and disgust. As in international
affairs, so in the political sphere, all sorts
of safeguards have been devised against the
traditional “arrogance of elected persons.”
We have triennial Parliaments, universal
suffrage, rules ordering the business of the
House, regulations to ensure fair voting; in
addition, dozens of governmental theories,
ranging from high Toryism to extreme Social-
ism. They exist because the people, as dis-
tinguished from those who speak for them,
want not only to be free but to do the fair
thing all round. There is no wickeder libel
than the incompetent politician’s claim that
his mistakes or crimes are “Australia’s” or
“the Empire’s” as the case may be. The
truth is he has managed to commit them in
the face of desperate public efforts to make
him go .straight. And if all this is even
approximately correct it would seem that
the cure for rotten politics, international and
domestic, is not more or improved
machinery, but a different type of politician;
and more particularly a different class of
leader.
FORESHADOWINGS OF A COM-
PLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD.
The starting of a different world is serious
enough to be an episode in any old globe’s
history, and there is a foreshadowing of
something of the sort. In both Canada and
the United States there is talk of closing
the door hard against indiscriminate immi-
gration. As regards Canada the change, so
far as all humanity ig concerned, will not
be so very great, for the Dominion, huge as
it is, amounts to a strip of rather moderate
width hemmed in between the United States
to the south and Frost-bite on the north.
Besides, it has never been wholly promis-
cuous. But if the big republic decides to
bar the entrance to all save a dribble of
respectable English-speaking arrivals, the
human race will sit up and take notice.
There are other fields for settlement —par-
tially filled, it is true, but still fields of a
sort: but the U.S. has been the immigrants’
country above and beyond all others. Should
it go out of the general-receptacle business
the event will mark the close of an era
which began nominally with Ponce ue
Leon and Hernandez de Soto and the
other Mississippi men, but really opened in
the years around 1850 —the Irish famine
time. Opened 1850, shut 1920,” may be
the rough-and-ready epitaph. Of late as
many as 30,000 immigrants are said to have
poured in per week —-people unsettled by the
war, nearly half of them unable to speak
English and looking hardly worth tuition.
It is a polyglot crowd, lately of scummy
laces from South-Eastern Europe, bringing
with it mixed religions, mixed feuds and
mixed ideas of sanitation. A change of
policy is inevitable some day, and when it
happens Uncle Sam’s country will have a
different inside and outside. Outside a big,
crowded nart of the world will feel wronged,
defrauded and disillusioned. Ever since the
I)e Soto and Ponce de Leon days it has been
the custom of the adventurous and the dis-
satisfied to go somewhere. This will be the pre-
liminary hint of a non-elastic world in which
there will be no place to go to. As the posi-
tion grows worse the birth-rate in many
countries will have to be reconsidered; also
the insufficient death-rate ; also the increase
ot population of the last 120 years; also the
struggle to preserve the unfit and to hunt
up cures for sleeping sickness, cannibalism,
tribal wars, paganism, human sacrifices, in-
fanticide and other habits which tend to
prevent the dark and partially-nude classes
accumulating three-deep on the face of the
earth. As regards the inside of the country
it will be necessary to face some awkward
and long-shirked problems.
* * * *
The republic lias behind it a boom
career of ab.out 117 years. There was a
brief independent existence earlier than that
and a longer colonial existence earlier still.
Put Washington’s republic was a mere
scrap or nucleus. Life on the big scale
began with the purchase of Louisiana. The
country hasn’t had a moment to itself since.
It hasn’t had time to settle down or to
wash up or to look round. It has enjoyed
two negative advantages or sobering influ-
ences. It never took the foreign loan disease
as Australia did, and it escaped that strange
Chinese torpor by reason of which Austra-
lia s rudimentary or experimental six States
have remained exactly the same old six for
over 60 years. Its other features have been
all of the violently excitable sort. It in-
herited much the same-sized fortune in land
as we did, and if this cost a trifle for
slaughtering the previous landlords the qual-
ity of the property compensated a hundred
times over. To go west and find the biggest
river system in the world —the vast Missis-
sippi-MissourLPlatte-Ohio-Red River net-.
work covering five-sixths of the country per-
pendicularly and about two-thirds horizon-
tally—was different from going west to find
the dry bed of the Cooper and the Place
where the Dead Men Lie. Then the Union
had a far bigger gold boom, silver boom,
copper boom and coal boom than Australia
ever dreamed of, and the world’s greatest
oil boom. And on top it had the biggest
boom in foreign labor —cheap, ignorant, bar-
barous, brawny, willing to work any hours
and sleep anywhere till it learned better —
than anv country ever had since the gilded,
rotten days of imperial Rome. The only
difficulty, as with the Indian in Natal and
the Chinaman everywhere, was to persuade
the stranger to remain cheap. The idea was
that he should assimilate and continue cheap.
Instead, he rose in price and didn’t assimi-
late. On Slav and “Polack” and “Bohunk”
and Irish labor while it was fresh, and on
luck and on machinery, was much of the
sudden greatness of Uncle Sam built. Tffie
industrial army was like the army of old
Carthage that went out 300.000 strong,
shouting in 30 languages and with a mere
handful of Punic officers trying to make
themselves heard in the national language
amid the din. In a very ordinary U.S. fac-
tory it became necessary to put up the in-
struction not to spit in 14 languages. And
they still spat; for the strangers brought
with them anarchism, the Mafia or vendetta
habit, the Irish question and samples of
everything else undesirable beneath the sun.
This immigration boom was really the coun-
try’s third cheap-labor experience, for the
Virginia convicts and the negro were of
earlier date. But they were small and
ordinary by comparison.
* * * *
The question of assimilating and Ameri-
canising the alien population has always been
kept in view, just as Australia keeps in view
the repayment of its debts. There are
practically three generations to be assimilated
—the 12,000,000 foreign-born and not of
British descent revealed by the census of
1910, with any later additions (the additions
in 1914 alone were over a million) ; also
many U.S.-born children and grandchildren
of unassimilated parents who, living in the
ghettos of their own people, grew up
strangers in their native land. The ex-
periences of the war impressed on people that
something much more serious than hereto-
fore should be done to discourage foreign
schools, newspapers, societies, churches and
other agencies which aim at making cohesion
impossible and nationality non-existent. The
question is whether the business, like the re-
payment of the Australian debt, hasn’t been
left rather late. In color matters, when
three persons assimilate one the result is a
quadroon. When one person assimilates three
the result is too dreadful to mention. If the
process of absorption is effective and complete,
a race will develop for which there is no pre-
cedent, the one thing that is certain being that
it won’t be the Pilgrim Fathers’ race, nor
Washington’s nor Andrew Jackson’s. On
the other hand, if nothing is done and the
separate races develop an increasing idea of
their own separate importance and an in-
creasing tendency to assert it, the case may
begin to resemble that of Pharaoh and the
Israelites in Egypt, only with 10 sets of
Israelites and not enough Pharaoh. A weird
possibility has been put forward that the
alien races, under some unexpected impulse
or unexpected leadership, may begin to
assimilate each other, leaving the real pure-
bred Uncle Sam out of the matter, and that
he may ultimately find himself confronted in
his own country with a concrete mongrel
bigger than himself. Daniel did well
enough in the lions’ den while the lions pur-
sued their separate interests and separate
lines of thought. If they had intermarried
and brought up families with a common
object in view it might have been the eclipse
of Daniel. So the feeling increases,
especially in this time of work-scarcity, that
the pol y glot immigrant should be
while the country takes stock of the situ?
tion. Meanwhile there is some debate
whether the difficulty first arose th a t ,°
passionate altruism (through the desired
make the Union a refuge for the oppressed
many of whom, on inspection, looked if
they hadn t been oppressed half as mnruf
they deserved), or if a misguided m-ayffi. for

THE ALLEGED RIGHT OF FREE
SPEECH.
A recent cabled statement that the Russian
Bolshevik organisation has 15,000 agents at
work to spread its views abroad is calculated
to excite surprise at the moderation of the
estimate. The statement that it has 13 print-
ing presses at work abroad —seven in the
United States, four in France and two in
England—excites surprise in the same way.
It certainly takes no account of the plant
which prints the subsidised Bolshevik paper
m Sydney, and apparently it doesn’t allow
toi the One Big Union, which is a Bolshevik
agency supporting the Bolshevik programme.
he reasons for all this activity are obvious
enough. Bolshevism is a religion like
huggism, Mormonism, cannibalism (when
accompanied by holy rites) and Moham-
medanism. It has the same ambition as the
ast to be a world faith. Mohammedanism
might have become a world faith if the
seventh-century Prophet had been able to
found newspapers in London, Paris, New
lork, Chicago, Sydney, etc. The new
creed, being born in brisker times, hopes to
succeed where the old one partially failed.
It. has the spirit of the London Missionary
Society with the difference that it mishes
tor profit, while the society fishes for souls
Wn y a f?u nVei l ed State wiU be a bulwark
fif/nst tbe returning tide of civilisation, and
will probably be a contributor of Peter’s
pence to the Bolshevik papacy at Moscow,
in tact, complete success should make Mos-
cow the centre of the faith—or rather of the
non-faith or anti-CiiRiST religion—rice
Rome (or Jerusalem) and Mecca, ignomini-
ously deposed.
n ?, w ur| faith has something to
offer to its adherents. In these days when
ie tendency is to pull down monarchies and
oligarchies, and substitute for them the rule
ot all the people it is the only political creed
m the market which promises the power,
ie profit and the glory to that perpetually
disqualified, dissatisfied, disgruntled insti-
tution the minority. It is the creed of
.Direct Action or seizure of all things by a
small, well-organised force—the smaller‘the
better, for then there is more to divide and
fewer to share in the division. It was this
f °f things which about 850 years ago
enabled 60,0(10 well-organised Continentals
to take over” England (“take over” is the
expression), and to do it so
effectively that their descendants are largely
in possession yet.
While the Bolshevik movement is still
sboit of success the leaders clamor with
gieat intensity for the right of free speech,
also ot free preach and free teach. Yet if by
free, speech they can climb to power it is
obvious enough that free speech will then end
peimanently. In Russia no paper that
doesn t wholly approve of the Bolshevik
Lovernment survives, and there are poor,
cola times for the person who doesn’t approve
by his vote, for voting is open and under
police supervision. Even freedom of work
is suspended, labor under supervision being
compulsory between the ages of 18 and 50,
and it being a crime to take a day off or to
x> e i i” e '., Australia, though the hour of
Bolshevik supremacy still looks far off (yet
looks may be deceptive), an attempt
has been made, and is still being made,
ip tbe Printers’ organisation, so
that it will refuse to put in type what is dis-
pleasing to the Bolshevik minority or its
bosses. At Broken Hill, which was for
a long while a sort of isolated Bolshevik
republic where no work was done, this stop-
page of the voice of the press has actually
been accomplished. Free speech by Labor
politicians in favor of compulsory military
service during the war, though not then a
contravention of the party’s policy, was
visited with the heaviest penalty w r hich the
bosses could inflict, while uproarious speech
m favor of the repudiation of the public debt,
thouffh that was also off the programme, was
allowed and encouraged. A very small mat-
ter ot free speech brought on "the veteran
Laborite lliggs summary expulsion. In the
N. 8. Wales Legislature untrammelled.,utter-
ance on the part of the new gospellers is
largely slander and coarse insult, and is a


foreshadowing of worse things to come. So
the question arises whether free speech when
it is all on one side, and especially when it
has for its purpose the establishment of a
state of things which will end free speech
for ever, isn’t as much over-rated as free
obscenity or free slander or free forgery,
which is merely too much freedom in speak-
ing another man’s name with a pen on a
document. And the same question arises
when speech is an incitement to murder,
arson, rape and robbery, these being the
inevitable concomitants of revolution, politely
described as “Direct Action,” and an induce-
ment to the formal “taking over” ( i.e., steal-
ing) of other people’s goods'
Unless Australia sacrifices some portion of
what is wrongly called “Liberty,” though it
is a kind that is of no use to anybody out-
side an undesirable minority, it is in
serious danger of havin" no liberty left.
In this matter the germ of an idea may be
found in that impassioned document, the N.
S. Wales Anti-Profiteering Bill of Attorney-
General McTiernan. It says (Clause 4S) :
Every person who in N. S. Wales aids, abets, coun-
sels, procures or connives at, or by any act or omission is
in any way directly or indirectly concerned in or
privy to, the commission of any offence under this
Act ....shall be deemed io have committed that
offence and shall be punishable accordingly.
The drawback’of McTiernan’s measure is
that it creates hundreds of new offenqes which
many people can’t help committing, such as
failure to keep accounts on an impossibly
elaborate scale, and having charged prices or
made profits five years before the measure
was heard of which the Court created under
the measure may deem excessive. But if
Clause 48 was adopted and applied to old-
established offences such as robbery, murder,
insurrection against the rule of the sovereign
people, usurpation of the people’s authority
and the like,_the idea has points. Assuming
that the men who advocate civil war, theft of
factories, workshops and other properties,
conspiracy to destroy valuable industries by
“irritation” strikes or otherwise, and so on,
were deemed to have done those things and
sentenced to the full term accordingly, the
gaols would be much more populous and life
outside them would be much more bearable.
This country has little use for the old-
fashioned sedition laws. .To speak evil of
kings doesn’t hurt kings and wouldn’t matter
much if it did, though if done in language
that is unfit for women and children to hear
it should be suppressed. Advocacy of the
peaceful disruption of the Empire is quite
reasonable on the ground that there are parts
of the Empire that the Empire would be better
without. But only born citizens of Aus-
tralia should be allowed to advocate our dis-
ruption. Most foreign disruptionists view the
cutting away of the support of the British
fVrmy and Navy as a step to the establishment
of a Bolshevik republic in Australia run by
themselves and their alien and often gaol-
bird friends, or absorption by some foreign
Power which is their paymaster. Foreign
Governments don’t matter to us, and some of
them deserve all that is said of them. Some
British Governments do the same. But there
is one kind of sedition which should rank
with parricide—the kind that aims at the
destruction by violence or fraud of any part
of the self-governing rights of the people and
the installation of minority or oligarchic rule
by force whatever name may be used to dis-
guise the act. That is what the Bolshevik or
One Big Union party constantly advocates.
Its definition of liberty, largely for aliens, is
the right of a largely alien mob to destroy
Australia’s freedom, and free speech doesn’t
cover that sort of thing. The man who sells
of conspires to sell the people to enemies
without or within should go the way of sordid
traitors and be held in perpetual execration
afterwards. The misfortune is lack of
sufficient execration to go round.
JAMES EDMOND.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australia First.
According to all the traditions of party
polities Hugh Mahon should have been re-
turned for Kalgoorlie. Had it been an ordi-
nary by-election fought on the familiar issue
between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the
result would never have been in doubt. But
it wasn’t an ordinary by-election, and
Mahon went under. He was the A.L.P.
candidate in a wholly industrial electorate
he had won with a substantial majority 12
months beforl, and the Government he was
opposing had indisputably lost ground in
the meantime (witness its signal defeat at
Ballarat) ; but be had put Irish politics be-
fore Australian interests, and his consti-
tuents decided that a member of that sort
was Do further use to them. . That is the
moral of Mahon’s defeat, and if Labor men
don’t profit by it so much the worse for
Labor. Kalgoorlie is a representative Aus-
tralian constituency—none more so and in
this matter it has spoken for the Austra-
lian people. Australia is fed up with foreign
politics. It is tired of being involved with-
out its sanction in the worries of Ireland
and Russia. It resents being told by recent
importations that they will stir up trouble
in Australia until Sinn Fein gets what i-
wants. It objects to being taxed for the
maintenance of windy individuals like CON-
sidine who rush from one side of the con-
tinent to the other “in the interests of Dau
Eirann.” It is dog-weary of being assured that
it ought to secede from the Empire because
of something that has happened at Derry or
Cork, and that it is a poor, benighted, down-
trodden country compared with Bolshevik
Russia. And it has observed with displeasuie
that many of these propagandists of disrup-
tion are venomously antagonistic to the men
who fought Australia’s battles abroad, and
that nearly all of them, infest the Laboi
party and are not disowned. Australia
has no lov e for fat persons who parade
their loyalty and make political capi-
tal out of it. But it has even less time for
the blatant breed who would smash its in-
stitutions or subordinate its interests to tho.
of foreign countries. Kalgoorlie has chose
an Australian who has never been opt .at t e
country in place of an imported ~
who, as his language shows, is still saturat d
with hatred and prejudices he fought from his
own country. Though the so-called Nationalists
have nothing to be proud of in the “ an “?
in which they fought the election and still
less of the comments of the so-called National
press in the Eastern States, a fair inference
from the result is that Australia prefers
politicians who will put Australia first.

The Difference Between Gold and
Paper.
Australia is addicted to moving in grooves.
No other sort of place with such a vast area
lying waste could have failed to establish
a 'single new State in 61 years. Now it
becomes urgent that it should shake off one
of its old habits and re-arrange its State and
Federal public accounts in two sections —
gold and paper. This is done by every other
country with a local paper currency and
local paper liabilities (like Australia), and
also foreign liabilities payable in gold and
for meeting which paper doesn’t count. That
is to say, it is done by every other country
so situated which thinks it has a character
to preserve. One-tenth of the blatant finan-
cial ignorance shown by the average machine
politician arises through the way the
accounts are camouflaged; the other nine-
tenths are natural. Australia owes (State
and Commonwealth) over £800,000,000. Of
that possibly half is due in gold and half
in paper. Possibly the metal proportion is
larger than that. Certainly at June, 1919,
the States owed £258,200,000 in gold, the
stuff that is §o hard and expensive to get
(France was lately stung by Uncle Sam for
91 per cent, on a renewal), and only
£138,000,000 in easily-got paper. Putting
State and Federal interest at £32,000,000
a year, possibly £20,000,000 of gold is
wanted. And if the budgets don’t show (1)
how much is owing in metal, (2) how much
is on hand, and (3) how much there is
reason to expect, this country hasn’t the
least idea how it stands. To owe £10,000,000
and have £11,000,000 in hand looks like a
million surplus and a reason for wild cheers
about the Government’s splendid manage-
ment, about the great resources of the coun-
try, and about the ripeness of the times for
another orgy and a rise in members’ salaries.
It may really mean that the Government is
short £4,999,999 on its foreign liabilities, and
is on the edge of a .smash in London, while
it has £5,000,001 surplus in paper—the stuff
that the Federal Government prints by the
ream and which no outsider will look at
while insiders may soon like it none too
well. Governments know the difference,
else N.S..W. Treasurer Lang wouldn’t offer
GA per cent, for a gold loan in London and
s is per cent, for a rag loan in Sydney. The
dishonesty lies in lumping the proceeds to-
gether in the accounts as if they were all
good money—good for all liabilities. Of
course, soggy tradition replies that Britain
doesn’t keep separate budgets; but, then,
Britain hasn’t made Government paper-
money a permanency. The ideal budget for
us is like that of Brazil —a country rather
bigger than Australia and also wiser. There
the Government cash-book, ledger or balance-
sheet has two sets of money columns for
both revenue and expenditure, one headed
“gold” and the other “paper.” The liabili-
ties, cash on hand and the Treasurer’s expec-
tations appear the same way. In 1920 the
totals were,: —
Gold. Paper.
Revenue .. £13,272,549 £34,283,880
Expenditure .. 8,041,369 39,971,905
Surplus . • £5,231,180
Deficit .. £5,688,025
The Brazilian Joseph Cook didn’t worry
much about his paper shortage, for he could
print more paper. The great point was thah
he was five millions to the good in the stuff
that pays off foreign debts and which has
its value all the world over. How our men
are situated no one knows, but if N.S.W.’s
Lang raises his £3,000.000 the chances are
there won’t be one half-sov. in the lot.
Experienced Treasurers in solvent paper-
money countries have also a habit of requir-
ing that Customs duties shall he paid in gold.
They reason that if too much is imported
there is a disastrous balance against _ the
country to be settled in gold. If there isn’t
enough gold floating round to pay import
duties with, then importing must slow down
and people must buy more local goods with
paper. For excise, land-tax, income-tax, etc.,
paper may be accepted, but import duties are
different. * If Australians had the financial
horse-sense of these capable South Ameri-
cans the recent commercial crisis in London
wouldn’t have happened.

Nippon at Close Quarters.
Absorbed in the Test match Southern Aus-
tralia was nowise disturbed at the- news
which came over the wires last week that a
thousand or more Japanese had taken charge
of a North Australian town. With im-
movable calm it read that our high-spirited
little brown allies had armed themselves
with clubs and sailed into the Timorese at
Broome, indentured laborers like them-
selves, had attacked and wounded policemen
who tried to protect the fugitive Ivoepangers
and had created a situation so ugly that rifles
were hurriedly issued to the white popula-
tion and returned soldiers were mobilised
under ex-A.I.F. officers, who compelled the
rioters to return to their settlement. Having
assimilated all this and heard, as it were,
the Jap legion thunder past, Southern Aus-
tralia plunged in thought of the cricket
again. It hasn’t got to live alongside a
swelling horde of bumptious Nipponese;
moreover, it is deficient in imagination and
has a way of letting the morrow take care
of itself. But the incident is a warning
which should not be wasted on those who
have the ordering of the national defences
and are charged with the enforcement of
the White Australia policy. Its significance
is that the Japanese in Northern Australia
are not only increasing in numbers but also
increasing in arrogance. At the 1911 cen-
sus there were only 3474 in the whole Com-
monwealth. To-day there are 1200 in
Broome alone. A few years ago they were in
a minority of the races engaged in the pearl-
ling trade. Nowadays the crews 1 of the
luggers that work the North Queensland and
North Westralia beds are mostly Japanese,
and at Thursday Island, as Knibbs men-
tions. they almost monopolise the business.
The immigration records show how Huji-
yama of Nippon has been ousting the com-
paratively mild and docile Malay. In 1911
more indentured Malays arrived than in-
dentured Japanese. But this was the position
in 1912 and subsequent years:—
Malays. Japanese.
1912 .. .. 326 698
1913 .. .. 303 822
1914 .. .. 291 387
1915 .. .. 285 423
1916 .. .. 254 1089
1917 .. .. 190 SBB
1918 .. .. 65 431
In 1914 and 1915 there was a slump in the
pearling industry and Japan was —nominally,
anyhow—at war. From Broome practically
every white pearler of military age went to
one or other of the war-fronts and hundreds
of Jap divers and shell-openers, who were
nearly all conscripts, went back to their
native islands. But in 1916, when the M.O.P.
market revived and it was clear that Japan
didn’t intend to over-exert itself against the
Hun, llujiyama and Kayakawa returned
in unusual numbers, and with them came
merchants and financiers with stacks of
money for the purchase of luggers—
if it could be arranged—and shell. From
that time the Japs have been trying
to make the industry their own. During the
remaining war-years their progress was so
rapid that it looked as if the white population
—except for a few officials, professional men,
dummies and wharf-lumpers—was destined to
be crowded out as the Manilamen have been.
But in the process of extending their power
the Japs contrived to make themselves ex-
cessively disliked. When the soldier-pearler
returned he found their insolence intolerable,
and new men coming into the business were
equally resentful and determined not to sub-
mit. As a result there has been an attempt
to substitute the obedient Malay for the
pushful and truculent Jap. It is a slow pro-
cess., for the training of primitive colored men
takes time, but last year over 400 Malays
(chiefly Timorese) were brought in under
contract and not more than 500 Japanese.
If the movement grows it will shatter the
Japanese dream of dominating the pearling
industry, and bv way pf showing the white
trash that lie is extremely annoyed, and of
asserting his racial superiority over his
humble brown relative (Jap and Malay are
probably first cousins) and of dissuading
mere Timorese and other poor relations from
interfering with Nippon and her ambitious
schemes, Kayakawa has been taking it out
of his lowly kinsman’s hide. It is an interest-
ing example of the methods which have made
the Japs so wildly popular with their still
closer connections in China and Korea, and
even the Australian Government, which is
starving the Navy and Army and hasn’t begun
to think of establishing an air force, might
learn something from it. For one thing, if
Justice, Ewing is available, it could start an
inquiry into the working of the indenture
system.

Another of Prohibition’s Failures.
Thomas Farrow, who was arrested last
week in connection with the smash of the
London bank which bore his name, belonged
to the large and growing army of those who
have fathered legislation that missed the
intended mark. Thirty years ago he moved
up to London from the provinces and started
an agitation to prohibit money-lending at a
high rate of interest. It was a golden age
for the reformer. Stead was at work on
his “Maiden Tribute” and Mrs. Ormiston
Chant was getting ready for her campaign
against the “morals” of the music-halls. A
number of parsons were striving to elimin-
ate the gambling instinct by prosecuting
bookmakers, and the Judges were working
overtime to identify “a place.” In Shef-
field the first conviction for many genera-
tions under the Lord’s Day Observance Act
of Charles 11. had just occurred, and the
anti-liquor forces were mustering round the
Cold Tea banner in the Midlands. Such
being the trend of the period, Farrow was
able to work England up to a great pitch of
excitement by the case which he established
against usury. He said harsher things
about it than the Early Christian Fathers
had done, though they, being Communists,
had regarded it as a crime—as in fact it
was in the eyes of the State throughout the
Early and Mediaeval Church epochs. The
Moneylenders Act went on the Statute Book
in the atmosphere of optimism that existed
in certain quarters when the U.S.A. recently
went dry. The business has never looked
back since. In the old days the usurer was
a vampirish miscreant uniquely deserving in
the popular view of the application of the
Unwritten Law. Borrowers flogged and
kicked moneylenders with impunity. Their
houses were burned down by ruined creditors.
In the 18th century it was fairly safe to
kill a moneylender, his status being about
that of a wizard in the 16tli century. The
Moneylenders Act forbade “harsh and un-
conscionable interest.” In a court of law
the moneylender was now able to demon-
strate the truth of what he had always
claimed —viz., that often he was as much
sinned against as sinning, and that, further-
more, what looked like sin on his part often
wasn’t sin at all. There was the case of
George Bower, gentleman, who with £6OO
per annum of his own used to borrow at
high interest and then plead the Money-
lenders Act. He was the 20th-century
heir to those ages which had flung the
moneylender into the nearest horsepond
when he asked for his dues. Bower was
sued ultimately, and Mr. Justice Lush said:
“Defendant went to the plaintiffs knowing
well that the Act of Parliament might give
him relief. In his (his Lordship’s) opinion
the Act was not passed for the protection
of people who made a habit of borrowing
money at high rates of interest, knowing
their rights under this Act and raising this
defence accordingly.” Judgment for the
plaintiff. There is another and commoner
class of ease, that in which the interest is
high because the security is nil, and in which
it suits the borrower to pay stiffly for accom-
modation. A barrow-man, for example,
might be saved from bankruptcy by being
allowed to pay a couple of shillings a week
for an advance of £lO. Here, too, the Act
takes the circumstances into consideration,
and the money-lender scores, on the whole.
What with one thing and another there
are 10 money-lenders in England to-day
where there was one at the time the move-
ment to exterminate them began; and the
profession flourishes proportionately in other
parts of the Empire. There is a moral to
all this, of course: frontal attacks ou strong
human tendencies are likely to do more harm
(from the attacker’s point of view) than
good. Where gambling is regulated it is
more or less innocuous, as in the case or
the tote ; where it is forbidden it becomes an
adjunct of criminality. England declines to
recognise the existence of prostitution:
France not only “recognises vice” but regu-
lates it. Any Digger will tell any inquirer
the difference between the streets of London
and those of Paris; and the V.D. incidence
figures are enormously in favor of > France.
And just as it is impossible to prohibit bor-
rowing-at-any-price, betting, “Sabbath-break-
ing” and “vice,” so it is impossible to pro-
hibit the consumption of alcohol. The fron-
tal attack represents the valor of fanaticism ;
success, real success, will only be achieved by
strategy.
The Real Enemies of the Empire.
It is fortunate for Australia that the Brit-
ish Empire takes a deal of dismembering,
for certain people are working very hard
to shatter it. The last thing most of them
desire, of course, is to see the institution
that means their safety and prosperity
destroyed or even endangered. Very few
Australians are disloyal in that sense. But
the dogma insisted on at so-called loyalty
meetings is that anyone who differs from
the methods of Lloyd George or W. Al.
Hughes is an enemy of the Empire. The
Divine Bight of Popes went about 500 years
ago; the Divine Bight of Kings finally col-
lapsed with William 11. of Germany. We
now get the divine right of retired solicitors
and ex-umbrella-menders. “As it is atheism
and blasphemy,” wrote Filmer in his “l’at-
riarcha” 240 years ago, “to dispute what
God can do, so it is presumption and high
contempt in a subject to dispute what a king
can do, or to say a king cannot do this or
that.” Substitute “Lloyd Geouge” or
“Hughes” according to taste for “king”
in the passage, and the reader arrives at
the attitude of people like the N. S. Wales
General Rosenthal. The point of view
was too unenlightened for England under
the Stuarts, and it is wildly out of place
in modern Australia. The people who are
exploiting it in connection with the Irish
row and on behalf of a continuance of war-
time legislation are, for the most part, on
the make. Some are politicians who have
failed to score on legitimate lines; some are
parsons who wish to fill their empty chapels.
They know that abuse pays, inasmuch as in
every community there are sections which
rejoice to hear other sections flagellated, the
lure of the dog-fight being imperishable. All
that is needed is something on which to
base the row. And the Empire serves.
There are words which change their mean-
ing by association. Nationalism, for example,
in the past few years has come to signify
Toryism. If Empire becomes a term of
opprobrium in many Australians’ minds, if
it gets to mean a disregard for the principles
of human liberty, combined witk_ cunning,
malice, bad grammar, cant and £25,000 gifts
for politicians who befriend the rich, then
our Imperialists-for-profit will be to blame.
No one can make capital out of an ideal
without splashing it with mud.
The Outlook for Westralia.
The prospect of being isolated from the rest
of the Commonwealth didn’t help Westralia
to digest its Christmas dinner. First the
stewards went on strike for the eight-hour
day, and the inter-State steamers stopped
running. Then the loco.-men on the almost-
bankrupt Government railways intimated
that they would come out on December 31
if their demands weren’t conceded. They
have had two rises in 12 months, the last in
September, and there was a railway deficit
of £400,000 in 1919-20, and of £360,000 the
previous year. Nevertheless, the drivers
want a 255. minimum for a seven-hour day
instead of 18s. lOd. for an eight-hour day ;
also they demand ss. 4d. per hour if they
toil beyond their seven hours; the same for
night work, and 7s. Id. on Sundays. The
firemen claim £1 for an ordinary seven-hour
shift and £2 for Sundays, and the cleaners
will be satisfied with 12s. 6d. per seven-hour
day for a lad of 18, 14s. 6d. for a veteran
of 20, and 16s. for a greybeard of 21, over-
time 50 per cent, and Sunday work 100 per
cent, extra. It looks imposing on paper,
but an agonised Commissioner remarks
that if he has to pay 25. per cent, more
money for 12| per cent, less work
it will mean another burden of £1,500,000
a year on an enterprise that is already
losing over £lOOO a day, and among
other certain consequences that would
“finish the goldfields.” , And even if the
42-hour arrangement is granted there can
be no finality about it, for the secretary
of the other (and larger) railway union
light-heartedly announces, at his periodical
interviews with the Arbitration Court, that
the “objective” of his organisation is the
36-hour week, and the concession of 44
hours was promptly followed by the demand
for 42 hours. Considering the obligations
imposed on the people by the war, the White
Australia policy, the uncertain economic
outlook and the horribly certain rockiness
of the finances, this continent-wide move-
ment for less work and more recreation in
a country that already toils less and plays
more than any other country on earth must
be accounted the most amazing species of
lunacy that ever possessed a nation. It
derives strength from the pathetic belief
that the less a man exerts himself the
more work there will be to go round, the
fallacy of which has been abundantly
demonstrated in N. S. Wales, which has
erected the pernicious nonsense into a sys-
tem, and which, as a result, finds itself
cumbered with an army of unemployed.
This ought to be enough to shatter the
superstition in an educated community, but
Australia is not in the right frame of mind
for receiving economic truths. It has a
craze for dancing after will-o’-the-wisps and
following false gods. The consequences will
be serious, in some cases calamitous, but
nothing can be done to avert them. The
disease, or madness, of shorter hours in un-
payable industries like the Westralian rail-
ways will have to run its course.

Christmas Eve in the Speck’s Assembly.
The Tasmanian Parliament goes into recess:
Premier Lee’s luck, plus a bit of Parliamentary
adroitness not often exhibited in the Speck’s Assem-
bly, enabled him to slip into recess just in time to
avoid • a hurricane that probably would have blown
his Ministry to bits. In hastily reducing to three
months Judge Ewing’s seven-year sentence on Trooper
Smith for the manslaughter of Bernard Burgess,
part-owner of the fishing craft Myrtle Burgess, the
Lee Ministry appears to have mistaken police opinion
for public and legal opinion. No sooner was the
remission made than the heaviest legal artillery
in the State unexpectedly opened fire on the Govern-
ment position. This, combined with a growing fusil-
lade of hostile notices of motion and pointed ques-
tions from the Opposition benches, began to make
things look desperate. When recess was still a
week away came old-man Burgess from Melbourne
to ask Premier Lee whether he proposed to confiscate
the Myrtle Burgess (half-owned by Bernard Bur-
gess’s young widow) as well as permit his police-
man to illegally kill the vessel’s master with a rifle-
shot. It was eventually arranged, after conferences
and interviews and bargaining not unskilfully con-
ducted on Premier Lee’s part, that conditionally
upon the Burgess family giving up any legal claim
against the Crown or its gunmen, and paying all
expenses, the Myrtle Burgess would be returned to
the widow. The settlement was a triumph for
Premier Lee. He announced it in the House on the
last day of the session and declared that the Burgess
family was quite satisfied with his generosity. He
is also alleged to have threatened Opposition mem-
bers privately that if any of them dared to comment
on the< terms of the settlement on the final motion
for adjournment (their oidy chance) he would decline
to ratify the settlement and confiscate the widow’s
little vessel. The threat failed in effect, but when,
on tlie motion for adjournment, lawyer-member
OgiljVie exposed the threat and started to flail
Ministers over the whole Burgess case, Lee and
all his supporters filed out of the Chamber, leaving
the Opposition there by itself. One Ministerial sup-
porter returned to the Chamber to call the Speaker’s
attention to “the state of the House.” The bells
were set ringing, but as the Opposition had unsus-
pectingly permitted four of its men to leave earlier
in the evening, they failed to ring up a quorum.
Thus the session ended, for the first time in 65
years, with snarls instead of felicitations, and
there was no interchange of compliments in the
Refreshment-room. Highly respected citizens (includ-
ing Premier Lee himself) are understood to deeply
deplore the incident, but —Parliament doesn’t meet
again till the middle of next year!
Mr. Pecksniff, P.M.G.
“SfX-AND-EreHT” : The amazing asininity
ot the lostal Department’s attitude towards
gambling thoroughly earned Tiie Bulletin’s
gibes (l(>/12/’20). Its methods show a
desire to subserve gambling provided it is
done in the foetid surroundings of a betting-
shop. A matter which stinks quite as much
as the telegraphic and telephonic facilities
mentioned by The Bulletin is the regular
service maintained by country-town betting-
shops with metropolitan and suburban
courses while race-meetings are being held.
The plan followed is for the shops to have
an agent on the course who, when the start-
ers _ appear, sends an urgent wire giving
their names and betting prices on offer in
the ring. On arrival at the country office
the wire is telephoned to the betting-shop
keeper, who displays the information in his
gambling den. Bets are then made up to
the starting-time of the race. The next
urgent wire gives the result of the race
just run and the starters for the next; and
so the game goes on, the country gamesters
away as energetically as if they
were on the course. To business people
with experience of the sloth-like methods of
the Postal Department the system seems
unworkable because, if the wires were
treated as ordinary business messages
are, they would not reach the addressees
till long after the last homeward-bound tram-
load of well-skinned punters had been
bundled out in the city. Such people cannot
realise what an efficient service this Phari-
saical department can give if only the cause
be unworthy enough, nor how much it will
strain at gnats and swallow menageries.
It will drop like a thunderbolt on the com-
paratively harmless “Adams Consultations”
and shut its eyes hard to Bananaland’s
Golden Casket. It will “Gazette” little
Hobart tobacconists, but will allow its wires
to be used by, and give a most efficient ser-
vice to, these country gambling hells. The
practice is well known; the urgent wires
and the ’phone messages shout the story.
If they did not the crowds of spielers,
loafers, racecourse touts and gamesters—
“sports” they call themselves—that infest
these rooms when a metropolitan race-meet-
ing i§ in progress are a sufficient indication
to anyone with an eye willing to see. The
police, of course, cannot "be expected to con-
cern themselves in this matter; they are
far too busy preventing flagrant offences
which would occur at local cricket and foot-
ball matches were the “foorce” not present.
The remedy? Either cut off the racecourse
telegraphic service, or prohibit the use of
urgent wires and telephones for the purpose
of sending the information necessary to
enable these shops to carry on their nefari-
ous trade. It is so obvious and easy a cure
that until its adoption the Post and Tele-
graph Department must remain under sus-
picion of professing publicly to wish to pro-
hibit, while, under some secret and sinister
influence, it really desires to promote, the
evil.
All Honorable Men.
Joseph Carruthers is the Sir Oracle of
the N. S. Wales Uppish House. Some-
times his manner suggests CincinnaTus
retired from the plough; at other times
Chatham nursing his gout in the House of
Lords; and now and again you get a distant
impression of Carnot humoring the whims
of Napoleon’s House of Peers. There is
infallibility in every syllable and inflection,
whatever the character he recalls. When
the latest salary steal was under discussion
Joseph digressed from the matter in hand
to ponderously rebuke the press. Parlia-
ment, he said in his dogmatic way, wasn’t
respected, and the newspapers were to
blame. They misrepresented and cari-
catured a noble institution, and it grieved
him to the soul. They insinuated that it
was no better than it ought to be, which
was disingenuous and calumnious and
several other grievous adjectives. “Those,”
he concluded, “who portray Parliament in a
false color and a false light are not honestly
performing their duty.” Some of Joseph’s
fellow-members took up the parable when
Joseph sat down. Indeed, the rush to paint
the lily and gild refined gold was somewhat
overwhelming. A story was quoted by J. D.
Fitzgerald:—
The late E. W. O’Suuuvan came in one day and
found a member sitting in the Parliamentary Library.
He went up to him and said. “How are you?” The
member answered, ■ “How am I ? I am in a hell of a
rage.” Mr. O’Suluvanasked, “What is that for?” He
said, “There is a blanky job on, and I’m not in it.”
But the drollery did not appeal to the
pontifical Joseph, who testily observed
THE RECEPTION COMMITTEE.
that “men were just as honest in those days
as they are now.” Whereupon Fitz-
gerald :
If men were honest then, they are just as
honest to-day as ever they were. There are just as
many rumors of dishonesty to-day as ever there were
in any period of the history of N. S. Wales. The anecdote
represents what actually did exist in Parliament at
that time, and no one can deny it. It explains why
we have railways running in all sorts of fancy
directions.
Dr. Nash took up the running:—
A member has said that former Ministers have
built railways and bridges for their own personal
ends. Is that sort of thing ended ? I could tell
of a dozen men, alive to-day, who went out of office
much richer than they went in.
George Black added his testimony:—
I heard a man who is a member of Parliament
say within a week of his being elected, “it is not
what you get this way”—holding out his right hand
m front of him —“but what you get this way”—hold-
ing his left hand behind him.
It was rough on Joseph, but he took it all
in. And he hung on long enough to signify
his gracious approval of the victims of
calumny healing the hurt that honor feels
by awarding themselves another £40,000 a
year. Whereupon returned
to his reaper-thresher.
Practical Decentralisation.
V. C. Thompson gives an account of the
progress of the New State movement in
Northern N. S. Wales:—
In the N. S. Wales Assembly recently the handful
of Northern members who have taken up the New
State movement secured the support of 18 members,
including two Laborites, for a Select Committee to
inquire into the claim of the North for separation.
Twenty-eight members, mostly Laborites, voted the
proposal down. It is a significant incident, and
the city dailies significantly ignored it. But the
Northerners are not deterred. They are going ahead
\\ ith their movement, which is not a politicians*
intrigue but a genuine popular agitation, with a
Press league composed of the principal Northern
newspapers and public leagues representative of dis-
tricts spread over a wide area which have dropped
their ancient squabbles and local agitations and are
concentrating upon this big push towards the settle-
ment of the Northern trouble. The Northern trouble
has been brought about by 50 years of the old State
policy of dragging everything to Sydney. The solu-
tion v e propose is the setting up of a single-chamber
Legislature, minus mid-Victorian frills, with suffi-
cient power to govern and develop our territory on
decentralised lines. That territory contains 70,000
square miles and carries a population of 460,000 —
slightly more than that of S. Australia.
In brief, we are fed up with the One Big City
madness and are after local self-government in
local matters, leaving the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment to deal with national questions. Other parts
of Australia are suffering from the very evils that
we are fighting. Echoes of our agitation are reach-
ing us from Central and Northern Queensland, where
the old separationists are beginning to rub the dust
from their eyes and talk mildly about holding Con-
ventions. There are also mutterings of discontent
from Northern Westralia, the Riverina and South-
east Victoria. In fact, the feeling is growing in
back-country Australia that the great problem of
development must be tackled by means of new
States liberated from the political and financial and
parochial pull of the Big Cities.
One of the immediate aims of the Northern agita-
tors is to keep Hughes up to his promise to hold
the Federal Convention next year. Another is to
create a public opi"nion in favor of the rural areas
being represented at the Convention in proportion
to their voting strength. This can only be realised
by insisting that each State shall be divided into
an equal number of electorates returning an equal
number of delegates on the basis of proportional
representation. If the Convention is not rigged in
favor of city interests there should, according to
Knibbs, be 42 per cent, of representation for the
capital cities and 58 per cent, for the country. Our
hope is that a Convention so constituted would not
sanction Constitutional amendments calculated to
perpetuate the disastrous political domination of the
congested cities.
The delegation of Northern separationists will go
to the Convention armed with a plan for the creation
of new States—not the small, ineffectual provinces
embraced in Labor’s tentative Unification scheme,
but self-governing and self-developing States. If
this proposal is adopted some of the new divisions
will be predominantly industrial; others predomi-
nantly agricultural. For example, if Northern
N. S. Wales were erected into a new State it
would begin with a rural population of approxi-
mately 80 per cent.—even if Newcastle were in-
cluded. Provided the seat of government were inland
and all ports were opened and connected with the
inland railway system, there could not be concentra-
tion at one seaport city; and thus there would be
small danger of a repetition of the centralisation
evil visible in the six existing States.
The present movement began in and derives most
of its inspiration from the Central North. The fact
has chilled some traditional separationists at Graf
ton and other North Coast settlements, and the feel-
ing exists it is just as well to recognise it—that
the agitation was born of a craving to have the
capital of the new State in the hinterland. But
one sure way of avoiding the One Big City disaster
is to take the seat of government inland—prefer-
ably about the centre of the State. Short-sighted
opponents object that Port Stephens is too much in
the thoughts of the North and North-West people
but as a railway from the tablelands to Grafton or
Coif’s Harbor is approved in principle by 99 per
cent, of Northerners it seems absurd to object to the
opening and development of the North’s only great
natural port. Parochial considerations are the bane
of every campaign for the extension of local self-
government. The Northern separationists have reso-
lutely grappled with this danger and are steadily
overcoming it. 1
In the way of organisation impressive things have
been done. There are now over GO New State leagues
principally between Scone and Wallangarra Early
in the new year the Central Executive, which con-
sists of three members of Parliament, two mayors
one alderman and four plain civilians, with Lt.-Col’
P. P. Abbott, ex-member for New England as
president, will make a big effort to organise the
North Coast and the North-West. Casino and Coff’s
Harbor have formed strong leagues, and are organ-
ising their districts, and Grafton, Lismore and
Murwillumbah are following suit. There is all the
eagerness for voluntary work which characterises
every successful popular movement. Tarnworth a
fortnight ago raised £lOOO for the campaign fund,
ami the local league has handed over £6OO to
the Central Executive. Walcha league takes the
local brass band round in borrowed motor-cars every
Sunday to outlying settlements where small leagues
are formed. In the Tarnworth, Inverell, Armidale,
Walcha, Guyra, Glen limes and Tenterfield districts
teams of local speakers go out every week to address
meetings and form more leagues. A Northern Con-
vention is planned to be held at Armidale in Feb-
ruary or March. After that Macquarie-street, which
has hitherto been mildly jocular, will begin to sit
up and take notice.
Members of the present Sydney Cabinet
take turns at explaining how the money
market has gone back on them so that they
haven t had a chance. Thus Estell the
other day:—
We are not in the happy position that many
Governments have been in. Obstacles have to be
K om w,;'-A e W F ! , d ° a “ we can .... Since the
Cieat war it has taken a large sum of money to
re-establish industries throughout the world....We
p •• ' • We are not in the same position as Mr.
E M. o Sullivan was in 1902 when lie approached the
money market lor £3,000,000 and was in the happy
nnn aYin |», lt ° ve , r -subscribed to the tune of
■ihu’f,? 0,00 '- l le ,State Treasurer is not always
able to give Ministers all they want. My own esti-
mates were cut down by £5,000,000.
The late Works Minister O’Sullivan a
hetty and record spender according to the
ideas of that time, got through loan money
at the rate of £4,200,000 a year, though the
resumption of the plague-stricken area of
Sydney absorbed anojther £1,500,000. When
the present two loans, said to be an assured
success, are floated, Estell and co. will
have handled £11,500,000 inside nine months,
in addition to nearly three times as much
revenue money as O’Sullivan and co. ever
had O’Sullivan was certainly offered 13
millions when h-e asked for three, but if he
had asked for 13 be probably wouldn’t have
got a halfpenny. About 1902 N.S W secu-
rities were comparatively ra*e, and investors
rushed them ; but if O’Sullivan and co.
had put them on the market by the truck-
loaa, buyers would have foreseen a slump
and fled out of sight.
«
De Facto” on weather and the races:—
Persons who ought to know better, both in Australia
and abroad, still occasionally repeat the old super-
stition that frost and snow and mists and general
misery are necessary to the evolution of a hardy and
virile race. A recent offender is William
MacDougall, a British psychologist, who has been
making some remarks about the need for cold and
wet the sort of climate MacDougall was .no doubt
leaied in to put iron into the blood and impart
toughness and force of character. But, as Professor
Osborne has reminded the Royal Society of Vic.,
these notions don’t square with some of the evidence!
The most morbid and pessimistic notes in modern
literature have been struck in Russia and Scandi-
navia. The ancient Romans were breS under sunny
skies and in a decently-warm climate and no one
accused them of being short of iron in the blood.
It is true that they degenerated in cold, damp places
like Britain and Northern France, but in Constan-
tinople and thereabouts the remains of the Eastern
Empire held out against long odds for nearly a
thousand years, the sunshine notwithstanding. The
Arabs, who conquered and traded and civilised from
Spam to Java and New Guinea, and from the Ural
Mountains to the Zambesi, were bred under a hot
sun which had shone on their ancestors for ages •
and the Portuguese and Spaniards, who burst the
bonds of ocean and opened up to Europe about half
the world, were not bred in an ice-chest either.
And the evidence given by Australian soldiers dur-
ing the last few years ought to lay the old ghost
for good.


Empire Defence and the Safety of Australia.
Mr. Amery, TJnder-Secretary for the
Colonies, in giving an outline of the naval
defence proposals for the Empire, stated that
it had been decided to adopt “a new system,
consisting of a defensive chain, of which'
each link will he primarily equipped to sus-
tain its own defence.”
Naval Defence is, tq Australia, of grave importance, and calls
for preparedness with ships of war, guns and munitions,
Australia cannot risk her safety by dependence upon others
to supply her needs in these directions. The facilities for
their manufacture in case of necessity must be established
here. This makes essential the development, on a sound
basis, of the
Australian Iron
and Steel Industry
apart altogether from the economic aspect of the question.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE MERRY-GO-ROUND.
The policy of the instinctive criminals
whose avowed purpose it is to destroy^ Aus-
tralian industries by “irritation strikes and
such-like is, naturally, to have as many
strikes as possible. The idea is that the
seamen should “go out” over their grievances,
while engineers, cooks, stewards, etc., He
back. When the seamen have gone in it is
presently time for the engineers to go out,
instead of making one strike of it and faxing
both troubles together. When both lots
are in. the cooks and stewards are beguiled
out After that it is probably the wharf-
laborers’ turn, and then the seamen are
due again. Strike manufacturers of the
irreconcilable sort are quite frank about it;
but why the country allows declared incen-
diaries to hang round its national building
with matches in their hands passes under-
standing. When people declare their in-
tention of lynching Australia it seems a
fair thing for Australia to lynch first.
“A signal victory for Loyalism to the
Empire,” W. M. Hughes said after the Kal-
goorlie election. In other words, the 8000-
and-odd Australians who voted for Mahon —
unionists mostly, whose class had a better
enlistment record than nine-tenths of the pro-
fessional classes—are hostile to the institu-
tion they risked their lives to maintain. The
argument hasn’t even the merit of novelty.
The party to which Mr. Hughes is now
attached used it against him when, as a
Laborite, he was advocating the R.A.N.
The N. S. Wales Ministry has 15 business
enterprises on its hands apart from the rail-
ways and tramways. On 14 of them, mostly
close to Sydney, the loss last financial year
was £16,170 and the accumulated los_s is
£44,784. Most of these supply goods for the
Government and are more or less protected
from the cold blast of competition. The 15th
—the great Murrumbidgee irrigation settle-
ment —lost £284,567 during 12 months, and
the accumulated loss is £1,038,364 or
£1,395,025 —it may be looked at either way.
This is on a capital of £5,136,122, practically
all loan money. The ambitious concern is in
its seventh year and might be supposed to be
round the corner, but as the loss grows bigger
it seems to be round the wrong corner. Even
the four temperance hotels are run at a loss.
Possibly things would be different if the
southern part of the Ma State set up as a
State by itself, and the far-off city, with its
city lawyer and city union politicians,
ceased to control the cheese factory and
the stud horse (even he lost £7O in the year).
If it isn’t city political finance and city
political management that are to blame, the
inference is that it is agriculture which is a
failure, and that would be a great deal worse.
A groan from a Vic. Gallery-man:—
Before the Assembly shut up for the holidays, it
gave a noble exhibition of utter devotion to its job.
In one sitting the Government introduced an Elec-
tricity Supply Bill for £1,143,000, a bill increasing
the authority of the Electricity Commissioners and
a Savings Bank Bill granting help to country indus-
tries. These important measures excited the languid
interest of about half-a-dozen—incidentally, there was
a notable absence of Hayseeds when the Savings Bank
Bill was getting a murmur of approval. But when
the Members’ Salaries Bill came up for discussion
the squash of politicians hungering to bestow a
blessing on the beneficent object almost got the
House fined for overcrowding. Then, having sent
on the Grab for the approval of the Council, most
of the members slid out to their interrupted ludo or
raspberry vinegar.
Captain Mahan first practised the naval
art with the crude tin-kettle ships of Abra-
ham Lincoln’s uncivil war. The book which
made his name, “The
Influence of Sea Power
upon History,” was
written 16 years before
the original Dreadnought
arrived, and is conse-
quently not quite up to
the mark about destroy-
ers, airships, wireless or
submarines. Later on
the old man made a
stern pronouncement
that an Irish republic
couldn’t be thought of
because “Ireland, by geo-
graphical position, lies
across and controls the
communications of Great
Britain with all the out-
side world save only that
portion which borders
the North Sea and the
Baltic. Independent and
hostile it could manacle
Britain.” He no doubt
intended to be friendly;
but if Ireland must be
manacled in the interests
of Britain, on the very
same grounds Britain
must be manacled in the
interests of Sweden,
Norway, Denmark, Ger-
many, Holland and Bel-
gium. On the whole,
somebody had better whisper Mahan’s
admirers to drop that argument. It is too
dangerously suggestive.
At a recent Irish Sunday rally it was
stated by Father Maguire, in Australia’s
biggest R.C. cathedral, that “the treatment
the Belgians were alleged to have received
at the hands of the Germans would not hold
a candle to the state of affairs in Ireland
under a British Government.” Certainly
that condition is bad enough ; still the Huns
didn’t begin by lending the Belgian farmers
£106,000,000 at nominal interest. Next time
treatment is found holding a candle, or even
lighting the gas, this should be remembered.
Mi-. Dooley—not the funny philosopher
but the N.S.W. Minister—issued a pro-
nouncement last week:—
I can assure the public that this Government is
determined, as soon as the financial stringency is
over, to go right ahead with housing on an extensive
scale.
The Government is raising between two and
three millions by new taxation and borrow-
ing this fiscal year just £13,404,750. How
much does it think it will borrow when the
“financial stringency” is over?
There is a vague belief in the N. S. Wales
Labor Party that the millions needed for
McGirr’s endowment of motherhood can be
got by means of sweeps. But there is brisk
competition in the sweep business nowadays
and the experience of the Westralian R. 8. L.
is not encouraging. That body sold 20,000
tickets in a ss. flutter on the Melbourne Cup,
and when it came to balance accounts it
found itself £2O to the bad “exclusive of
the organiser’s remuneration.” It awarded
that functionary an honorarium of £l4O, and
retired from the industry for good.
HOW SANTA CLAUS CAME.
The N. S. Wales teachers’ Christmas was
rather spoiled became the frisky Ministry,
with about £30,000,000 a year of revenue and
£14,000,000 of loans coming in, couldn’t find
the money to pay the increases due them.
So the pedagogue with £3 or £4 a week, who
had been relying on- this little windfall for a
’bus fare to the seaside and a bottle of ginger-
beer when he got there, had to stay at home.
Members’ own increases (to £l6 12s. 7d. per
week) were, however, paid to the tick.
Farmers who had been relying on the State’s
promised prompt payment of 2s. 6d. per
bushel were also a trifle discomfited to learn
that there wasn’t a bean to pay with. But
they hadn’t been thinking of going anywhere
- —save perhaps to the dogs.
It wasn’t always money that came to the
committees which whipped up the gift to
Billy Hughes; for instance, from the Far
North the Brisbane canvasser got this: —
For five years Mr. Hughes has run the Commonwealth ;
for the last two years he has preached and prattled
about White Australia and the settlement, of the
Empty North —the “Achilles’ heel” of the Common-
wealth. Each of the last five years has made the
Empty North emptier and emptier. Another five
years of the same sort of government and it will be
empty altogether, for patriotism and enthusiasm
have their limits. We in the Gulf have had our
£6OOO subsidy for running cargo and mails (once
a month) taken away from us this year. For Burke-
town port alone this has added on a yearly £8460
to the load of the poor fools who are trying to keep
a portion of this Empty North of Australia open and
white, besides curtailing and wiping out odd mails
and post and telegraph depots. Repatriation methods,
the opening of Canberra, the iniquitous delay of the
North-and-South railway, and last, but worst of
all, the enormous debt not yet completed that the
Prime Minister is going to leave with the Common-
wealth stamp him as the greatest political curse
that has ever hit the Commonwealth.
“Henry Horsecollar’s” few remarks: —
Tootling Sunday-school platitudes N. S. Wales
Premier Storey spoke a Christmas carol about the
advisability of employers and employees becoming
reconciled at “the festive season,” about the impor-
tance of Ireland settling down into a state' of repose,
and about forgiving other people’s enemies. “Our
former enemies have paid the price of their folly,
and the time has gone by when we should seek to
crush them,” said Old Copybook. Yet our biggest
foreign enemy, the one who counts, hasn’t begun to
pay any cash indemnity yet; and the little farmer
of the Ardennes or the pig-raiser of northern Serbia,
spending his seventh Christmas among ruins (though
partially repaired now at his own expense), doesn t
want anybody to forgive his enemies for him. John
can afford to beam in the turkey season. He is the
epitome of the slug on the cabbage leaf. He has
£2445 a year—enough to keep eight families and
21- times the pay of one European President —and he
hasn’t even the smallest portfolio to carry. He has
the use of a motor-car, and a free pass, and there
is six months’ holiday ahead. He is Labor, but he
hasn’t needed to soil his hands with real labor for
13 years. He and his 12 colleagues keep up the
pose of philanthropists, men of light and leading
and doers of things, and at the same tiifle avoid the
brain fag of hard struggle and hard contriving by
selling the children and the children’s children into
bondage to the capitalist whom they profess to hate,
and to the profiteer (money-lending variety) whom
they profess to loathe. One way and another I would
as soon take my chance on the Last Day with
Pecksniff and Gomorrah as with a sleek motor-carist
and racecourse patron at £2445 a year who has so
much benevolence for the unrepentant people who
made Europe a shambles, and so little for anybody
whose sin is that he runs an Australian factory and
pays union wages or that he doesn’t fall down and
worship the Anti-Profiteering Bill.
The latest sea-strike was only a day or
two old when an appeal was made in the
name of humanity for aid out of the public
funds for the women and
children involved. It is the
regular thing now to demand
that the people who are
being steadily ruined by
strikes often on the most
trivial grounds, should con-
tribute out of what they
have left to indirectly keep
the strike alive. At least a
partial remedy is available
if some Government could
assimilate a new idea. It is
to enact that every married
woman shall be automati-
cally a member of her hus-
band’s union—both of her if
he is a bigamist; that she
shall have a vote in the in-
dustrial legislatures that run
the things which concern
her as well as in the Parlia-
mentary ones that hardly
count. Then if her partner
decides to starve her it must
be with her consent, or
through her neglect, and she
will no longer be the victim
of unmerited misfortune
whom the community is
almost bound to assist.
There will remain the indirect
sufferers —the non-strikers who are unem-
ployed through the strikes of others—but
they would get their turn of responsibility
when their own strike came round.
The party struggle for votes produces some
queer results. Though the Labor crowd is
supposed to be in favor of unification, the
debate in the Westralian Assembly on the
proposal that, to save expense, the Corhmon-
wealtli should collect both State and Federal
land- and income-tax produced a State frights
outburst from that side. Even the usually
level-headed Collier spoke of “the surrender
of sovereign rights,” although he did not
oppose the measure. It was Tommy Walker,
now of Ivanowna, formerly of Northumber-
land (N.S.W.), who led the attack. Tommy
declared that he was a Westralian first
and an Australian afterwards. In his
view “the Commonwealth was the creature
of the States, created for their benefit and
convenience.” In other words, presumably,
the creature of Tommy Walker, who speaks
for the State. Incidentally, the total, of the
free and enlightened of Walker’s electorate
would hardly make a respectable gate at a
third-rate suburban picture-theatre.
From Sydney Telegraph’s special repre-
sentative in Melbourne:—
According to Mr. Burehell, the Government Whip,
who has just returned from the Kalgoorlie cam-
paign, the issue was narrowed down, on the National-
ist side, to the one question of loyalty and of uncom-,
promising opposition to Sinn Feinism. Labor
attempted to make the issue the general political
policy of the Government and its damaging effect
on the cause of the worker. But the Ministerial
candidate (Mr. Foley) declined to be led from the
real issue of the contest. He is a good platform
speaker apparently, and was able to arouse the
voters to a recognition of what the effect must be
if champions of the Sinn Fein propaganda could cap-
ture an Australian constituency. The Labor party
declined to accept that as the issue, and centred the
whole of their efforts in getting back the seat as a
Labor stronghold on exclusively Labor grounds. Mr.
Foley won, and the Hughes Government has. now an
easy majority over all parties in the Representative
House.
So the new member (assuming the D.T.’s
informant is right) represents nothing but
anti-Sinn Fein. Which is another way of
saving that Kalgoorlie has disfranchised
itself on Australian questions. An undesir-
able, yet practically certain, outcome will
be (again assuming the man who described
the campaign to the Telegraph representa-
tive knew what he was talking about) that
the Hughes Government will take the result
as a tip to run the sectarian ticket in connec-
tion with other seats which they know can’t
be won on legitimate lines.
THIS COMING TEAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In 1921
The world will hardly be the world of yore,
Ere came the blight and bloodshed of the War,
And sane unrest gave place to maddened strife.
Now from infected ground there springs to life
An evil fungus, which to fools appears
A wholesome growth; dark gath’ring clouds of fears
Hide the bright stars of hope from Wisdom’s view,
The while our old year ushers in the new.
What web of trouble may friend Fate have spun
For 1921? *
In 1921
We’ll talk of Test Match, heedless of the things
That greatly matter, and when tea-bell rings
The latest scandals we’ll discuss betimes,
And echo spicy gags from pantomimes.
In little matters —futile, false and mean—
Next year shall be as former years have been:
The future be —for upstart, cad and boor —
The past but entered by another door;
The silly things we did again be done
In 1921.
In 1921
Young love shall bloom as fair, and smell as sweet,
At early dawn, or in its noonday heat,
As in the days of chivalry ; men lie
Who flout romance and voW that love can die,
Or lose its glamor for the coming race
As customs lose their outward forms of grace,
Or, rather, change their fashions; love shall still
Sway all mankind, control all human will;
And girls and boys will seek whom they should shun
In 1921.
In 1921
Grave sober men, content with steady lives,
Untempting, and untempted by, the wives
And daughters of their neighbors, shall increase
Their worldly store, and sleep the sleep of peace,
Whilst prodigals, cast forth among the swine,
Dream of the days of woman, song and wine,
Yet, brooding on the past, be prone to smile,
And think and think the follies were worth while.
No le.-sons shall be new beneath the sun
In 1921. .
In 1921
The birth and death-rates —human come-and-go—
The joys and sorrows, born of weal and woe,
The rain and sunshine, bringing flood or drought,
Shall bear the statist’s cold predictions out;
The passing show proceed in the old way,
And we be players in an endless play ;
Our parts unmeasured, save by prompter Fate,
Who orders all our exits soon or late.
Well, here’s good Death! or Health and Lots of Fun
In 1921.
VICTORIA.

After an unfavorable run, during which war
and ’flu cut deeply, the National Mutual has
just come through perhaps the most suc-
cessful accounting period of its 51 years.
The past 12 months have been remarkable
for: (1) the record volume of business
handled; (2) the unusually light mortality
experience, resulting in a surplus half as
large again as that for 1019; and (3) the
high interest earnings of invested funds.
Tue National Mutual is an unusual office:
primarily owing to the obstinacy of one of
the founders it has never concerned itself
with Indus trial business, and its attentions
have thus been restricted to people who are
in a position to contribute premiums quar-
terly. In most life concerns the Industrial
dept, can be depended upon to serve more
or less as a feeder to the Ordinary branch.
Without that assistance the National Mutual
has now got its income to well over the 21
million-mark, and has nearly doubled its
figures in nine years. In other words, it lias
in those nine years put on as much weight
as it had developed in the previous 42. The
expansion, however, has not been restricted
to the Commonwealth.; besides being estab-
lished in all States and Maoriland, it is
writing business in the U.K., S’Africa and
South-Eastern Asia.
From a claims point of view the 12 months
to Sept. 30' were exceptionally favorable.
During 1919 1831 death-claims made a call
on funds for £035,315; during the past year
only 989 policies assuring £381,154 were
presented for collection. But during the
latest 12 months endowment assurances and
straight-out endowments called for £285,534,
compared with £268,819 for the previous
year. Including with the claims bonuses
paid in cash, premiums returned, surrenders
and annuities, the year’s outgoings to policy-
holders represented p.c. of total
income, compared with t>o.2 p.c. for 1919,
45 6 p.c. for 1918 and 40 p.c. for the year
prior to the war. The improvement com-
pared with 1914 meant that of last years
income £108.235 more remained in the
National Mutual’s coffers, while many people
who might have been expected to die, and
so maintain a normal loss-rate, are still
left to pay more into the Association by way
o f premiums. The improvement was to a
slight extent effected by the improved earn-
ings from investments, average funds now
giving 7s. p.c. more than in 1914. This
comparison shows the steady improvement of
the rate of interest, earned :

These percentages are shown after deduct-
ing taxes, which, at increased rates on an
expanded business, now call for iIo.UUU
more than six years ago. This comparison
gives further details: —

The saving resulting from the milder loss-
rate on an income expanded by improved
interest earnings is offset to a small extent
by a higher expense rate. Nevertheless,
the National Mutual’s business-writing and
administrative costs are less than in pre-war
days:— »

The increase of the expense rate by 28s.
7d. p.c. compared with three years ago was
not altogether due to the general tendency
of costs to ascend. Larger volumes of new
assurances have been flowing in each year,
successive accounts establishing new recoids.
During the past year 16,898 new policies
assuring almost millions were written.
New business is necessarily costly, and
though it is impossible to estimate with
accuracy how much of any year’s expenses
should be set against new policies, as a
basis of comparison over a number of years
the cost of handling old, or renewal, business
may be roughly set down at t p.c. of pre-
mium income, and that of single-premium
business 3 p.c. After deducting these
amounts from total expenses the balance may
be regarded as the cost of the new business.
Applying this formula to the accounts over
many years we get this comparison:—

1919 .. 226,503 151,038 66.7 „
1920 .. 250,796 176,694 70.5 „
There can be no complaints about excessive
new-business costs. Only 10 years ago every
shilling of the first year’s premiums and a
few pence of the second year’s went in put-
ting new business on the books. But
expenses are still not so light as those of
several other offices: the fact that it has
established world-wide organisations may
account for that. In one quarter its expenses
are easier; it has cut its medical exes, to
the bone:—

That percentage is about three points under
the medical costs of most offices.
Last year’s £1,234,031 surplus took total
funds to over 13J millions. Total assets,
however, amount to 15 millions. So anxious
was the management to take up the high-
interest War and Peace Loans that £885,000
is shown as a debt incurred to buy into
gilt-edged securities. Mortgages used to be
the long suit, but even during the past year
big changes have shown up:—

General-manager E. J. Stock, who is also
the actuary, completed his triennial inves-
tigation’ early' this year. Notwithstanding
war and ’flu, he reported all well: assuming
that funds would in future earn only 3£
p.c. p.a. (though actually they were earn-
ing over 5 p.c.), he estimated the Associa-
tion’s obligation to policy-holders (Sept. 30,
1919) at £11,734,881. The assurance funds
exceeded that by £789,488. Though larger
by volume compared with earlier surpluses,
it was smaller in proportion to the amount
of business in for.ee. The whole of the
£789,488 was distributed, providing rever-
sionary bonuses of £1,450,000, adding from
about £4 10s. to £7 per £lOO assured accord-
ing to age of entry of the policy-holder and
the currency of the policy. An interesting
feature of the investigation was that during
the triennium claims were 96 p.c. of the
management’s expectation—“2o p.c. higher
than any previous experience,” adds g.-m.
Stock. The fact that even war and ’flu
failed to result in losses greater than the
management had arbitrarily calculated on
indicates the wide margin of safety life
offices work on in normal times. Policy-
holders as a whole pay in considerably more
than is required to provide the cover they
seek. This is the principal source of sur-
pluses and consequent bonuses. Higher in-
terest earnings and more favorable expense
rates than were allowed for are other sources
of surplus. It is interesting to note that
though the latest investigation unearthed
£789,488, during the three years to Sept.
30 last only £26.700 was withdrawn in cash,
the whole of. the balance being _ applied by
policy-holders to purchase additional insur-
ance.
During its 50 years to 1919 the National
Mutual had issued policies assuring over 92
millions, had collected nearly 21 millions
of premiums, eaimed 7i millions of interest
and paid out over 10 millions on behalf of
policy-holders.

During the past 10 years there have been
half-a-dozen additions to capital provided out
of visible reserves. The latest lot of bonus
shares —increasing the holdings by practi-
cally one-third —has come from internal re-
serves. When post-morteming this very
successful co.’s accounts, the “Wild Cat” on
many occasions has remarked that it would
have been surprising if, during its great run
of prosperity, the management had not carved
down the book value of its belongings. The
threats of the McTiernan Anti-Profiteering
Act probably decided the directors that it
was advisable to disclose something of what
had been thus reserved for contingencies. So
£78,277 was lately shaken out of the sleeve
and tacked to capital. There were, in fact,
two sleeves; in conjunction with the move-
ments resulting from the past half’s opera-
tions the book value of freehold properties
lias since April last been taken from £51,201
to £82,884 and borrowers’ and purchasers’
balances from £247,915 to £289,499. The
increase in these balance-sheet entries practi-
cally coincides with the bonus additions to
capital. It is unlikely that even new book
figures represent present actual values. The
directors declare that the whole of the
£78,277 capitalised was profit earned prior
to June, 1914 (therefore not subject to
Federal taxation), which had been “held in
suspense.” No doubt, further profits have
been hung away out of sight during the
past six years.
The Intercolonial is the most successful
suburban land and building concern in the
Commonwealth. The heavy borrowing policies
which have been inflicted on the Ma State
ever since the first Labor Government
started to buy popularity with Cohen’s
money have helped the achievement; but the
Intercolonial has also been blessed with a
management which has taken full advantage
of all opportunities and developed subdi-
visioning to a fine art. The volume of
business handled by the co. is not disclosed;
but the magnitude of the present turnover
compared with that of 10 years ago can be
gauged from the fact that whereas in 1910
paid capital was only £56,122, the past year’s
disclosed net profit was £41,789: That
profit is so handsome that, on a paid capital
which had been expanded to £313,724 with-
out calling upon shareholders for penny,
it gives a return of over 13 p.c. Not only
is the dividend return very sweet, but there
is remarkably good security for all the bonus
capital which has been issued. Apart from
any internal reserves that may still remain
there is £94,715 of visible reserves besides a
taxation reserve of £ll,BO0 —no doubt also a
genuine reserve. Put another way, there
are net assets with a book value of 275. 9d.
to represent each £ of paid capital.

ing! On the full tally of assets of £103,947,
considerably more than half of which con-
sists of city and suburban freeholds, the past
year’s gross profits gave a gilded return of
over 20 p.c. In spite of the fact that the
Commonwealth, particularly the big con-
gested cities, has experienced boom condi-
tions during recent years, and though the
huge increases of ordinary and savings bank
deposits tend to support the belief in the
plentifulness of cash, Uncle is doing more
handsomely than ever. For some people
credit can never be over-stretched, and in
such times as these, when even the more
cautious are wallowing in luxuries on bor-
rowed money—a wise old banker told the
“Wild Cat” recently that in appeals for
accommodation new motor-cars figure most
prominently on the lists—it is not surpris-
ing that the three-balls industry should be
prospering on higher interest rates.
years ago the book value of pledges, stock,
accrued interest and sundry goodwill items
totted up £36,845; since then no new capi-
tal has been got, but reserves are nearly
£12,000 more. No goodwill items are now
included in the composite asset, whicn
totals £40,351. Meantime interest on
pledges, profit on sales and rents have moved
from £11,852 to £21.591, while expenses have
gone from £8637 to £15,273. Though the
latest net profits show over 48 p.c. on paid
capital, on actual money put into the busi-
ness the return is not nearly so fat. borne
years ago employees tapped the cash-box tor
about £14,000, and capital was afterwards
written down from £21,579 to £12,911.
Besides, there are now reserves of ±1
surplus profits accumulated during the past
six years having added to reserves an amount
almost equal to present paid capital. .
During recent years the Australian M.-de-P.
has been busy buying premises. Two years
ago the directors paid £37.000 for a corner
block which was to assure a central city
position “for all time.” During the past
12 months, however, they have acquired
another corner block which they consider
even more suited for the co.’s business.
Together with the suburban premises—there
are nine branches —the property account now
totals £57,228, compared witli only £3lOO

The accounts give the year’s net profit as
£11,693, but that was after transferring
£3500 to a reserve for taxation and con-
tingencies, and, since current taxes appear
to have been otherwise provided for, in the
table this-transfer to reserves has been re-
garded as net profit earned. The £15,193
is a remarkably fine performance, particu-
larly since directors give the assurance that
“conservative valuations” of stocks were
made. During the past year Lamson Para-
gon has widened its interests/ having pur-
chased the Eclipse Qo.’s business in Sydney
and opened up a branch in Perth. This
expansion necessitated doubling paid capi-
tal ; 24,800 new £1 shares were issued early
in the year at par, and in August 13,000
more were placed at a premium of 2s. 6d.
per share. Divs. of 10 p.c. on the lot gave
shareholders a splendid return, while the
margin of surplus profit left in the business
was equal to a further 12$ p.c. on the en-
larged capital. Of the £9382 undistributed
£3500 has been dropped into the reserve for
taxation and contingencies and £3200 has
been used to write down goodwill to £3OOO.
The business began as a proprietary in 1897,
but was taken over by a public co. 11 years
ago. The progress made since the first
accounts of the co. were presented has been
very rapid : —■

liquid assets (including the conservatively-
valued stocks) over liabilities has expanded
from £10,016 to £50,638, and the book value
of fixed assets is now £27,718 greater. So,
with the assistance of £45,480 of new capi-
tal and £1792 of premiums, net assets have
advanced £68,340; or, put another way,

business with £47,272 of new funds, profits
remaining after the distribution of good divs.

capital, the co. now shows 255. 7d. of net
tangibles—an excellent 10 years’ perform-
ance. JLamson Paragon at present runs two
factories, but during the past year a free-
hold was acquired in Sydney, where, later
on, manufacturing will be concentrated.
For the first 11 months of 1920 the
decline in the gold yield went on even a
shade faster than usual, and the year bids
fair to be the worst since 1851. The best
year of_the first (or Victorian) gold boom
was 1856. The best year of the second
(or mainly Westralian) gold boom was
1903. This was really the bigger boom of the
two. The date of the next boom, if there ever
is one, is quite uncertain; but both the old
ones, which were 52 years apart, are dead.
It is noteworthy in this connection that
Stawell (Vic.) has followed the example of
Ballarat and closed its last mine without
any doxology. It is significant also that at
Ivalgoorlie there were 2000 less visible elec-
tors this election than last. Stawell and
Ballarat have other things to live on, but
Ivalgoorlie, when it closes, will probably be
desert again. Westralia built its big debt origi-
nally on the security of Ivalgoorlie, and tacked
a sinking fund on to it, recognising that
a Golden Mile is a fleeting proposition.
But the very swift debt is £ll7 per inhabi-
tant ahead of the very slow fund, and the
latter seems out of training. Also, the
accumulated deficit, which is the third party
in the race, is almost as big as the sinking-
fund, and some people are putting their
money on it.
“ J.L.S.”: The Monash-Michell contro-
versy on Kiewa v. Morwell left out of
account the essential fact that Morwell
must become the ultimate source of Vic-
toria’s fuel requirements, and its opening-
up as such is complementary and not sub-
sidiary to the power scheme. The future
programme for Morwell has, as its initial
object, the opening up of the deposits on such
a scale that Victoria’s fuel needs may be
locally met as soon as possible. This will
involve the sale of raw coal and raw-coal
briquettes bcjore the sale of power. As it
is essential for the success of a briquetting
scheme at Morwell that it shall be entirely
self-contained, the Electricity Commissioners
had no option but to go to Germany for
their briquetting plants. English and Ameri-
can briquetting machines working at low
pressures (up to two tons to the square
inch) can produce very satisfactory dried
lignite briquettes using 10 per cent, of raw
coal-tar binder, and their initial cost for
the same output is lower than the German.
Unfortunately! if a binder briquetting in-
stallation were decided on as the best thing
for Morwell, there would not be sufficient
tar available from Victorian sources to
supply more than a small quota of the
requirements for the large output of bri-
quettes contemplated, and dependence upon
supplies of tar from the N. S. Wales gas-
works and coke-ovens would defeat the
main object for which Morwell is being
developed, viz., complete independence of
supplies of fuej and auxiliaries outside the
State. It is certain that briquettes made
by German presses without binder, and at
pressures up to 12 tons to the square inch,
will be superior to the raw coal in calorific
value, will save freight, be better for stor-
age, will weather better, and value for value
they will certainly be cheaper than the raw
coal at the respective vending prices. The
question of carbonising the raw coal for
by-products and briquetting the carbonised
residue, using tar from the process as
binder, for the production of high-grade fuel
is not likely to be adopted until ithe power
scheme is well under way. There are tre-
mendous difficulties in the design and mani-
pulation of suitable installations for satis-
factorily retorting Morwell brown coal, and
it is likely that the ultimate solution of the
problem will be along coke-oven lines rather
than those of low-temperature carbonisa-
tion, which has not yet advanced beyond
the experimental stages anywhere in the
world. Herman’s mission to Europe is not
only to arrange for the supply of German
briquetting presses, but to look carefully
into the question of the most likely method
for carbonising the raw coal in the manner
and for the specific purposes that the local
conditions obtaining in Victoria demand.

Wage increases granted by the Westralian '
Arbitration Court to mine-workers on the
Ivalgoorlie and surrounding goldfields have
staggered mine-owners. The increases, it is
claimed, add about £350,000 to production
costs, apart from the effect of the granting of
shorter hours underground, holidays, mini-
mum pay for contract workers, higher over-
time rates, etc. Even with gold at its present
inflated price, the Chamber of Mines declares
that only one or two of the big mines of
the field can hope to carry on at a profit.
Tributing on an extensive scale is suggested,
but although, to the discredit of the Boulder
Perseverance Co., tributors have flourished
on that property, they are not likely to fare
so well on most other Golden Mile mines.
Besides paralysing Kalgoorlie and knocking
the bottom out of the Hampton Plains mar-
ket, the award has caused several options, ir.-
eluding the one held by the Boulder No. 1
on Block 45, to be thrown in. Apparently
Westralian gold-mining is in for a very cold
time.
The mill appears to be smashing two more
Westralian idols. Kanowna Red Hill was
officially declared to have a reef worth 30dwt.
over a width of several feet, with ounces in
places. From work done the gold seems to be
almost wholly confined to quartz veinlets of
ribbon to string width in flat porphyry forma-
tion, the picked stone averaging about lodwt.
Most of the returns obtained from the show
in years gone by, and about which so much
was made when the present co. was floated,
were got by dollying and crushing sorted
stone. Shares have slumped, and it will take
something more than present prospects to
buck up the market again. The other idol
is Edna May Battler, to which The.
Bulletin has so far refused to bow. Chair-
man Tricks assured shareholders at the
recent meeting that the profit from crushing
the ore in the dump should more than pay
the co.’s debts, which were then declared to
be about £4OOO. He also cheered holders by
saying something about a lode worth 9Jdwt.
over a width of 10ft. to 40ft., which he opined
could be mined and milled for £1 per ton.
Reports, however, disclose that the battery
is not doing as well as expected, and shortage
of water is also put forward as an excuse for
unfulfilled promises.
Gold-stealing is still proceeding in the
West, and despite the Chamber of Mines and
special police vigilance thieving of bullion,
amalgam, specimen stuff, etc., seems to be in-
creasing. Years ago the audacious and
affluent receiver used to run a battery on a
dummy mine and treat what was stolen by
himself and others, and when that method
was exhausted he went round the country
buying up and getting sensational returns
from tailings which others had found unpro-
fitable to treat. Now the practice is to peg
out a lease, get reports of rich finds published
in the newspapers and follow them up with
good crushings. This is how the bullion
stolen some years ago from the Bullfinch was
got rid of.
Kanowna Deep Deads (W.A.) is again
being probed for gold-bearing wash, and the
usual yarn about good prospects is being
spun. Many attempts to find wealth there
have been made during the past 20 years,
and several cos., including a couple formed
in Adelaide and Melbourne, have been in-
cluded among the failures. The gold is
there all right, but quantities are too small
to make profitable extraction possible.
* * * *
Burbridge, near Southern Cross (W.A.),
where the remains of the Bronco Horse-
shoe and other defunct ventures are laid to
rest, has just had another sad bereavement.
This time the Great Victoria, which, was
once offered to the Gt. Boulder for £50,000
cash together, with a share interest, and
afterwards to another London-controlled
Westralian co.. has closed down. The lode
in the property is immense, but its gold
contents are very poor. The average extract-
able value is under 24dwt.
* * * *
“Quarry Hill’s” requiem :
The Magdala Co., formed in 1869, sank to 2409 ft,
at Stawell (Vic.), to find those horizontal reefs, the
Oriental and Cross, . which yielded so much of the
stuff we read about and nowadays very seldom see.
The craze for deep-sinking, that curse of Bendigo,
killed Magdala, as it has destroyed Bendigo—but
only temporarily. Up till 1885 shareholders had
put up £120,000, and the mine was then sold to
the Moonlight Co. for £B5O. At 1400 ft. the new co.
struck a rich bulge in the old low-grade formation
and drew £277,000 in divs. Then the Great
Boulder, of W.A., butted in with an option, and
butted out after boring with neither faith nor hope.
Sloanes and Scotchman’s, another Stawell co. with
a vivid early history and a melancholy modern one,
took up the Magdala-Moonlight and dropped its bundle
of boodle. Now the plant has been sold. Stawell
produced over £9,000,000 of gold, and it has always
been a question whether the western slope of the
Big Hill was the best place to explore.
The other great mine whose requiescat this is, the
Chiltern Valley, will for all time be linked with
the name of J. A. Wallace, that courageous old
pioneer miner who made a fortune from gold and
put 75 p.c. of it back into the ground. Chiltern
Valley Co.’s plant the other day fetched £6875 and
will be dispersed. The mine produced gold worth
£1,291,000 since 1876. Wages took £677,164,
materia] £240,961 and divs. £238,530.
* * * *
A low copper market combined with high
freights . and other costs are crippling
potentially great mines on the outskirts of
the Cloncurry (Q.) copper region. Many
of these are in the hands of the original
prospectors or parties with small capital, as
the three big cos. have a string of mines in
all stages of development and are offered
more shows than they can carry, for the
region is extravagantly endowed with copper.
In one mine worked by the prospectors the
freight to rail alone is 355. per ton, and with
back-loading just as dear the only possible
plah is to pick the very highest grade ore;
even medium-grade stuff must be largely dis-
carded. Several of these mines work with
small steam plants and Holman hoists, and
get down 100 ft. or so through the rich red
and black oxides and on to the enriched
secondary sulphides. No development work
is done; as soon as the high-grade oside or
bornite is exhausted the mines are oftener
than not abandoned. It is not uncommon to
see considerable tonnages up to 30 and 40 p.c.
copper sent to the smelters, the net result
being that in future it is going to be diffi-
cult —in some cases probably impossible—to
make ends meet when the time comes to
exploit the deposits on a large scale. It is
difficult to see a solution without dis-
couraging the prospector—and he deserves
all he gets—but inevitably serious deteriora-
tion is produced in mines which should be
great producers.
Queensland Mines Department intends bor-
ing at the Ross River to determine the ex-
tent and quality of the iron-ore deposit
recently located there. The find is in the
Townsville hinterland and about 30 miles
from the seaboard. Since the State iron-
works became a concrete proposal Mines
Minister Jones has had the State geologists
exploring every corner of the Northern State
for likely deposits and investigating every
rumor of so-called mountains of iron, mostly
without much success. Biggenden, the Clon-
curry iron deposits at Mt. Philp, and Mt.
Leviathan were, of course, known ; but the
Cloncurry ore found little favor on account of
its location and its silica content ranging
from 10 to 20 p.c. Biggenden is high-grade stuff
(64-70 p.c. iron) but extensive boring in-
dicated only half a million tons. Iron
Island was likewise good but deficient in
tonnage. The Ross River outcrops consist
of dense magnetite, and some of the lodes
have a width apparently of from 40ft. to
100 ft. While the surface indications are
good as regards quantity, no estimates are
possible until the proposed boring is carried
out. Analyses of the surface material range
from 62 to 67.5 p.c. iron, silica 2 to 6 p.c.,
phosphorus 0.02 p.c. to 0.08 p.c. and sulphur
0.01 p.c. It is the best prospective deposit
located in the State excepting Biggenden
and Cloncurry, and boring results may place
it first. It is only 100 miles from Bowen by
rail.
* * * *
Following a call on the shareholders, the
old Vulcan Mine, at Irvinebank (Q.), is
showing activity again. The manager is on
the ground, bailing of the old workings is in
hand and the surface machinery is under
overhaul. Part of the lease which is not re-
quired at present has been let on tribute, and
from a surface shoot 50 tons of ore sent to
the battery returned just over two tons tin
concentrates. The co. is out to operate in the
deep ground below the present -workings.
The Derek Co., Stannary Hills (Q.), has
been doing considerable development work on
the Lass o’ Gowrie and You and Me, and
the erection of a new 10-hd. battery is nearing
completion. The foundations are "down for a
large concrete dam, but crushing will be de-
layed by inability to secure supplies of
cement. The co. can go ahead as soon
as water is stored, as there are about
16,000 tons of ore in sight in the You and
Me estimated to carry close up to 3 p.c. tin.
The floating of the Mt. Quamby gold-mine
has stirred up interest in Cloncurry (Q.), and
about 300 acres have been pegged out sur-
rounding. Geologist Ball was on the field
recently reporting for the Government, and
his report will be available immediatelv.
Results will be watched with interest, for as
a rule the M!t. Elliott Co. does not let a good
thing slide.
The Empress Mine, at Herberton (Q.), is
on a good shoot at the 255 ft. level, and a
winze has been sunk 50ft. on it. The stuff
so far raised is carrying 11 p.c. copper and
lOoz. sflver, and goes to the Chiflagoe
smelters.
* * * *
High-grade fluorspar is being shipped
south from the Mistake mine, Emuford
(Q.). Eighty tons were sent away last
month, and now that the roads have been
metalled for traction-engine traffic increased
quantities will be available for shipping. The
fluor body is over 15ft. thick, so it ought to
run some distance. The co. is getting £5 a
ton.
“Technologist” : G. Loftus Hills, the Speck’s
fetate. Geologist, has created a precedent in
warning the public against investment* in
cos. formed for the purpose of boring through
the pelionite measures of the Barn Bluff
district in the endeavor to find oil. Recent
research on the origin of petroleum from
vegetable matter has proved that, under cer-
tain conditions and in favorable geological
formations, oil-shales, torbanites, cannel-
coals and the like, occurring high in a series
are good indications of petroleum lower
down. It, therefore, seems of paramount
importance that the State geological staffs
.should thoroughly survey known oil-shale
and torbamte districts to ascertain if such
favorable geological conditions do obtain
betore authoritative pronouncements one way
or the other as to the oil possibilities of
such districts are officially made. Whilst
the Speck s chief geologist does not hesitate
to condemn a project which has a few good
features to recommend it, -the Victorian
Mines Department is ominouslv silent on
the Gippsland oil-boring propositions, which
have much less to commend them than the
Barn Bluff venture. There is, at present
too great a tendency in Australia to rely
on the opinions of drifting oil experts as to
certain geological features being in com-
mon with the oil-fields of Pennsylvania.
California, Mexico, etc., when topographical
resemblances are really meant. So long as
thp authorities allow public money to be
sought through misleading channels, the
harder will be the ultimate task of those
depending upon the confidence of the in-
vesting public to support legitimate oil
prospecting when there is sufficient evidence
to warrant boring on the extensive scale
necessary in virgin oil-field development.
The glamor of oil and the £50,000 reward
offered by the Commonwealth Government
are producing the inevitable wild-cat boring
schemes which nearly always retard pro-
gress. I would suggest that no oil co.
be granted registration until the prospectus
has been approved of by a petroleum-commit-
tee, upon which there should be at least
one geologist of repute and one petroleum
expert.

Claude Tozer, the victim of the Lindfield
(Sydney) tragedy of last week, had had
more narrow escapes from death in the last
hve years than most men. Early in his
A.I.F. career he got enteric and was one of
the last half-dozen patients in No. 1 General
Heliopolis, when the vast million-pound* hotel
was evacuated. In those d'ays all typhoid
cases were automatically returned to Aus-
tralia—-this was by urgent request of the
hrench, who feared infection. But Tozer
worked the oracle, rejoined his unit and
went to Flanders. Brilliant and solid, at
the same time a sportsman, a brave man
and a delightful companion, he was the sort
of M.O. that every battalion wanted. For
some months he saw all the front-line service
any man might want. He won his D.S.O.
for a specific act of gallantry in a disaster
from which few but himself emerged alive.
He was hit by shrapnel on this occasion, and
it went so near the brain that it had to be
left there. When the influenza arrived he
had two bad doses in succession—both
acquired while attending to other sufferers —
and shortly after being invalided home he was
operated on for appendicitis. Tozer had a
wonderful ear for a hard-luck story, and he
could stand up effectively to the most despotic
of brass-hats. He was six feet three, with
a handsome, delicate-featured face, the
readiest of smiles and the cheeriest of dis-
positions—a splendidly vital young giant.

About a military Pooh Bah:—
When Warrant-officer F. S. MeClean, of the
R.A.G.A., was invested with a bar to his D. 5.0., at
Sydney Government House last week, the Governor-
General unconsciously became particeps criminis in
a military offence. The D.S.O. is an “officer deco-
ration,” and Mr. McClean, qua W. 0., has no right to
wear it. As Lieut.-Colonel McClean, of the 4th
Pioneers, A.1.F., he has every right; but if he had
turned up at Government House in that capacity he
might have been put under arrest for the military
offence known as “masquerading,” he being a per-
manent soldier. On the other hand, if he hadn’t
appeared in any capacity he would have been guilty
of “disregarding a royal command.” Another anomaly
of his curious position is that, as W. 0., he is
required to salute at such functions captains and
majors who have never seen any service, and subal-
terns who were under his command in France, all
of whom should salute him in his capacity of Lieut.-
Colonel.
From the Federal Gallery:—
The Federal Labor party won’t go into its deepest
mourning over the loss of Hugh Mahon. He was
never liked, and his concentration on Ireland’s
wrongs to the exclusion of many things that are
nearer and dearer to Australians often erected a
bairier between him and those most sympathetic
to Erin’s aspirations. One remembers him in the
Reps, as a tall, lonely man whose attendances were
not conspicuous, and who could only be aroused from
his forbidding silence by some reference to the ould
sod. To underlings he was nearly as warm and
inviting as an ice-works in midwinter, and he almost
invariably spoke to officials without any of the
friendliness which characterise most other members’
intercourse with the staff. After years in the House
■he knew no menial by his Christian name, though
it took the genial Ryan less than a session to find
out the attendants and treat them with a kindliness
and affability that are invincible in winning loyal
seivice. Whilst Mahon departs a comparative
stranger, Ryan has become a first favorite in no
time by sheer bonhomie, tact and good nature.

Sid b owler, one of the raciest of Back-

ora Miner, the only paper published in the
electorate, and allowed his A.L.P. opponent
more space during the campaign than he
took himself. It was chivalrous, but he
didn’t wm the seat.
“Jarrahlander”: The Japanese riot at
Broome (W.A.) cost Police-Inspector
Thomas his life. Rushing about in the
melee he got heat apoplexy, and worry did
the rest. Thomas was only a handful, and
elderly at that, but he had plenty of pluck.
I recall him as a talkative but very intelli-
gent little chap, a capital chess-player and
a friend to all pressmen, more especially if
they shared his unconquerable aversion to
J s.P. He was one of the veterans of the
force, and it was hardly a kindness to send
him in the evening of his days to a tropical
station where quarrelsome colored persons
abound and the whites are outnumbered 10

“Whitehall”:—
With the death last week of the Dowager Lady
Roberts, England loses the original of a favorite
Kipling character—the managing Anglo-Indian
Colonel’s wife who was first discovered to the public
by Thackeray. She domineered over her great little
husband, and gossip said did a great deal to make
him. A large, square-jawed, plain and dowdy woman,
she yet held his affection to the extent that during
their married life of 55 years, and through all the
temptations offered by Society to a rising soldier, no
scandal ever attached to his name. As soon as he
died (in 1914) she began a campaign to have his
earldom vested in their daughter, the son who, like
his father, won a V.C., having been killed in the
S. African War. She duly succeeded, and when the
new peeress married she settled down with the more
or less young couple for life. Any action on
Roberts's part which was a little out of keeping
with his reputation as a chevalier without reproach
was always placed by the public on the broad shoul-
ders of his wife. For example, his recommendation
to Hector Macdonald to go abroad and shoot himself
after the Colombo scandal, and the F.M.’s persistent
habit of having dukes on his staff irrespective of
their military capacities.
Records are transient things, but J. C.
Mclntosh holds one that will endure. He
left Perth for the war as a stretcher-bearer
in the 4th Field Ambulance. He returned
six years later, having come most of the
way i.e., from London to Melbourne—by
air-’bus and the rest of it by motor-bike.
To be knocked down by a tramcar is seri-
ous at 71, and S. It. Heseltine never really
recovered from his accident last September
in an Adelaide street. A foundation mem-
ber of the Adelaide Racing Club when re-
formed, he brought a business mind to the
secretaryship nearly 30 years ago, and his
power of organisation had much* to do with
the present strong position of the club.
Passed out at Lewisham Hospital, Sydney,
last week, Father James Hanley, a dis-
tinguished missionary, aged 78. A Dublin
man, educated at Castleknock College, he
commenced his priesthood at Cork, came to
Australia 34 years ago and conducted mis-
sions all over Australasia. On retiring from
work 10 years ago he took up his residence at
the headquarters of the Vincentian Fathers,
Ashfield.
Bedchambers, the Humbug Scrub (S.A.)
naturalist, has honor in other countries. He
has received a letter from the Bellchambers
Nature Club, founded in his honor at Farn-
borough, in Hampshire, England, and anxious
to have a message of encouragement from
the great Australian.
Donald Blackwood, M.A., who topped the
1020 class lists of the Australian College of
Theology, stewed for his exam, in a period
of “complete rest” (at least, that is what
the doctor ordered) : he was badly gassed at
the I ront. . Donald put in 34 years on ser-
vice and gained a majority and the M.C.
M. A. Callaway, Under-Secretary in Vic-
toria, is going into retirement after 47 years
in various branches of the service. (In N. S.
Wales the Minister is the Secretary ; the per-
manent head is the Under-Secretary. In
Vic. the Minister is Minister; the permanent
head is the Secretary, except the secretary
to the Chief Secretary—he is the Under-
secretary.) Callaway will be succeeded by
C. S. McPherson, who is jumping from billet
to billet in a most absorbing way. When
1920 was quite young he became Chief Clerk
of Education ; a few months later he won to
a similar post under the Chief Secretary.
This fresh promotion gives him a further lift
in salary and authority.
J. P. Jones, leader of the Labor party
in the Vic. House of Deadly Decorum, and
W. J, Beckett, his deputy in the same
Chamber, are going for a trip to the Co-Id
Country early in ,1921. Both are pretty
well-to-do. Jones has made a lot of money
as a clothing manufacturer, and is recog-
nised as an employer who gives a fair deal
in pay and conditions. He has been a
leader in the Socialist party and is an ideal-
ist. So much is he trusted by the Uppah
House that most of the All Wools would
just as soon have him as a trustee company
for an executor. Beckett is a sporty mem-
ber, who has made a competence in a furni-
ture business in Fitzroy, where he is Mayor
this year.
From the Federal Gallery:—
No one looking at the mild, birdlike face of George
Maxwell, M.H.R., would suspect him of great tena-
city and endurance. Yet given a project to seize his
imagination, he will take all the biffs that come his
way and still keep his enthusiasm. It is years and
years since he developed political ambitions. In
1897 he tried to win the P’ran seat in the Vic.
Assembly from the amiable Mackinnon, who was
outed by ex-soldier Parker the other day. Maxwell’s
ideas were glaringly Liberal and his personal repu-
tation was as glaringly perfect; but he had to tramp
that constituency, wearing out his tongue spruiking
at many a door, to get himself considered at all. .He
lost, but later on was up again, unabashed, with the
determination this time of beating John Murray.
People talked of Maxwell’s audacity in butting into
Weary’s stronghold, but his peripatetic energy, aided
by a respectable tongue and eternal good humor, adver-
tised him immensely, and he just missed by 47 votes.
After that he had three more big struggles before
he reached the Federal Parliament by a microscopic
majority, and he well knows that he is only repre-
senting a volcano liable to engulf him in 1922. In
the last few years Fawkner has become increasingly
Labor, and the strengthening of the R.C. Irish vote
bodes no good for Maxwell unless Ireland’s troubles
are settled in the meantime.
“Topo”: Parker Moloney, iu.H.R., w as
running a college in Beechworth (Vie )
when Tate started out to smash the rotten
system under which only 44 per cent, of
young Victoria received secondary educa-
tion. Vested interests squealed, and the
college masters formed a defensive union
but Moloney re-
fused to join.
“This man,” he
said, “wants to
train children
whose parents are
unable to pay our
fees. I’m with
him.” As a matter
of fact, the pri-
vate schools pro-
fited by the local
interest in educa-
tion which Tate’s
campaign aroused.
When the Depart-
ment got to hear
of t e stand
Moloney had
taken, a job as
State secondary
teacher was
offered him; but
he went into the
Representatives as
member for Indi
instead.
Dr. MORRIS, the
Speck's chief
health-officer.
Jack Taverner, a former Agent-General
who is still making a punch in England,
had a mannerism that used to delight the
Vic. Leg. Assembly. Jack had been a coach-
driver in the way-back, and he got into
the habit of shaking his head and shoulders
to shoo off the flies without letting go
the reins. The habit stuck for years. So
did his habit of having what he called a
“nosebag” in his office, when he was a
Minister, instead of going out to lunch.
Some men have left the Vic.. Government
printing office for their pocket’s good. Max-
well, M.H.R., worked there for a while with
J. E. Mackey, now Speaker of the Vic.
Assembly, and both captured their degrees
almost simultaneously. Another old hand
is the horse-owner known as “Ben O. Ben-
nett.” He has captured a bag of cash with
his squad of young neddies, the most success-
ful being Antarian, which won the rich
Maribyrnong Plate at the last Derby meeting.
Lieut. Mclntosh has again slaked a thirst
for adventure. Recently he and Parer flew a
“ ’bus” from England to Australia; the new
stunt was to cross from East to West of the
Continent on a motor-bike. The trip bristled
with accidents; the worst being between
Kitchener and Zanthus, where the machine
upset and pinned him down for 2\ hours.
Mclntosh declares that he would rather fly
back to England on the oldest ’plane in Aus-
tralia than again rrrake the across-Australia
trip. r
“Concave”: The secret of Brookfield’s hold
on the Barrier workers is that he is utterly
fearless and transparently sincere. When
he first won the selection ballot for Sturt
the Central Executive of the P.L.L. refused
to endorse his candidature. He took two
florins from his pocket and said: “That’s
what stands between Jack Brookfield and
starvation. No employer on the Barrier
will give me a job. If I win this election
I go to Sydney. If I lose I will have to
pick up my swag and take to the bush.”
Sydney it was. At the last election Percy
was in Queensland collecting funds for the
strikers until a week or so before polling-day.
In his own forthright way he said to the
ejectors: “Three years as a politician have
satisfied me that Parliament is only a pal-
liative at best. I’ll go back to Sydney if
you send me there, but you will be only plac-
ing an additional parasite on your backs.”
They made him a parasite again, and he still
puts up with it.
“Ex-Dig.” recalls a warrior:—
The A.I.F. had an interesting officer whose name
was Green. He was of Irish descent and liked to
remember that his people belonged to the Old
Country. Some disparaging remarks at the mess
about the British Army prompted him to heave a
dish of stew over a superior officer, and he challenged
two others to mortal combat. After that he was
transferred to the British Army. But he must have
struck the wrong regiment, for at his own urgent
request he was received back in the A.I.F. It
developed that he had desired to fight all the officers
of the regiment because of some labored witticisms
about the Irish. After that he had another row about
invidious references to the British Army, got into
trouble because he reckoned the men under him were
not being given sufficient latitude, and earned popu-
lar disfavor amongst the same men by insisting upon
salutes. Later on he was relieved of his commis-
sion at his own request, and he got back to Australia
somehow. But within six months he had returned to
France as an n.c.o. and this time a Fritz shell got
the touchy but gallant and good-hearted fellow for
keeps.

who arrived at Moreton Bay in the year ’6B in the
ship Golden Dream.” —Brisbane Daily Mail.
The piers were all aflaunt with bunting gay;
Our dearest waved and wept and shrilled good-bye;
We left the land that knew our natal day
To find green hills and vales and alien sky;
But hope in ev’ry bosom proud was high,
In soul we leapt ashore by Southern stream
And cleft the frondage thick of purple dye,
What time we shipped it in the Golden Dream!
What charm on that far land enchanted lay!
What hidden glories did we dimly spy!
What haunted forests lined its lovely bay!
What golden sands Pactolean lured the eye!
What birds of wondrous plumage rose to fly,
Then sank again in flame and flash and gleam!
What dangers drave us back and drew us nigh,
What time we shipped it in the Golden Dream!
At night the stars with soft inviting ray
Called “On and on!” to timid souls and shy;
The morning breeze would chide us for delay, '
The freshening breeze spring forth and “Courage!”
cry;
We never weighed the wherefore and the why,
And life was gold because it dared to seem— '
How could young pulses leap yet basely lie
What time we shipped it in the Golden Dream?

Dear hearts and true, your visions never die;
Youth sails afresh whene’er its fancies teem’;
With silken flags and silvern oars ye ply
As when we shipped it in the Golden Dream!

GOODYEARITE —Asbestos Sheet Packing—
for safe service and long' service
THE experienced engineer when
choosing packing is influenced
by two main considerations.
The first is the matter of efficiency and
the elimination of shut-downs caused by
faulty joints. The second is the safe-
guarding against injury to machinery
and operatives. And, because it is
unsurpassed in these two important
elements of service and safety, more
and more are engineers using Good-
yearite, the long-fibre Asbestos Sheet
Packing.
The needs of modern specialised
machinery demand higher and higher
steam pressures. These latter require the
employment of a high-grade Asbestos
Steam Packing able to withstand the
enormous pressures and high tempera-
tures without loss of efficiency.
Goodyearite, both white and graphited,
is made from the longest fibre rock
Asbestos obtainable, compressed into
sheets, and contains only a minimum
of binding. Manufactured by a special
Goodyear process, gaskets made from
it resist amazing pressures and heat. It
eliminates the danger and annoyance
of leaky joints and the necessity of
frequent renewal.
Goodyearite is unquestionably the most
economical packing that you can put
into any steam joint except those
carrying very low pressures. We ask
you to make comparative tests with
Goodyearite, the results of which will
fully prove the claims we make.
Goodyearite cannot burn, blow or squeeze. It stands first in all
competitive tests, including the resistance of heat up to lOQOdeg.
Fahrenheit, and steam pressure of over 4001 b. to the square inch.
A sheet of Goodyearite 1-16th inch thick measuring 36 inches by
36 inches weighs approximately 61b. and sells at 7/6 per pound.
For your protection it is stamped Goodyear Goodyearite on every two
inches of packing.
Send to,one of our branches for a sheet, and we will explain the method
of application proved most satisfactory by experience.
Here is an opportunity to prove our claim that Goodyearite is the
best high-pressure Asbestos Steam Packing on this market.

WINES
From the Bar table: —
Philip Newbury got a useful Christinas box out
of the Tkiad last week— £soo damages and an
advt. that should be worth as much again. The
paper’s Melbourne critic had accused him of
“squawking like a turkey.” The Law allows a wide
latitude where people who set themselves up for
public praise or blame are concerned. Why was
the Triad hit so hard? In the first place, no doutft,
because the jury had an idea that to talk of squawk-
ing turkeys in relation to one of the finest artists
in his line that have appeared in Australia is not
iriticism at all. It is more the protest of the

“But not so much as success has to do
with one’s appearance.”
small boy who throws an anonymous brick through
the window of the suburban home while the “musi-
cal conversazione” is in progress and silently flees
into the void. But more than that there was the
sentimental aspect. Newbury is no longer young,
and he has been up against it of late. The defence
actually extracted from him the fact that he had
had to sing on beaches for a living—the same defence
which was trying to explain away his loss of a £35-
a-week engagement, and which had gone Out of its
way to admit that on his merits he should never
need to perform on beaches! Unlike most bf his
trade the little man proved a good witness. He
Captivated the Court by his fortitude and good
humor, and made even Brissenden appear ponderous
by contrast. But, chiefly, the case established a truth
which has been increasingly obvious of late.
With modern juries it is not, in the words of the
bid ballad, “wot ’e sez, but the narsty way ’e sez
it” that counts. Anyone may damn a man with
dispraise, but the use of bottles is barred.

“Mirza”: The morning after Miss Gwladyi
arrived to brighten our boarding-house she
arose with the sparrows and tripped along
tb the bathroom. So did Brown a few
ininutes later —only Brown didn’t trip; hd
shambled —and opening the door which
Gwladys had failed to lock he found her
trying to conceal herself behind the shower;
“Beg pardon, Mr. Smith,” said Brown
smartly, and backed out. Gwladys recounted
the incident to Mrs. Hashhouke. “Ah,” said
that red matron, “Mr. Brown is a born dijfi
lpinhtist; and you want to be careful Of

“Anyone could see even at a glance that 1

bers of a two-up school at Hornsby
(N.8.W.) last week. When raided they
Were playing in the hush. Not as is usu-
ally the case in a city park or a highway
or beneath the window of a police-station,
hut furtively amidst trees, and with the
evident object of evading detection. Two-
hppers are ordinarily charged under Sec.
58 of the Police Offences Act with “playing
to the annoyance of passers-by in a public
place.” As the Hornsby sportsmen were
held to be offending privately they, were
proceeded against under Sec. IV of the
Vagrancy Act, which imposes gaol without
the option. And as they didn’t appear in
court till Thursday they had to spend most
of the allegedly festive season in Long Bay
prison. It suggests a reason why clubs,
hotels, boarding-houses and the private resi-
dences of Judges, magistrates, barristers
and so forth are never raided. All would
have to be dealt with under the “Vag/’ and
there isn’t enough money in the State to
build the gaols to hold them.

“Norbell”: The lately-departed Bishop of
Melbourne occupied th.e star bedroom of an
up-country pub one night. Bung’s little
back office, where all night long a willing
hazard school rattled the dice-box, was
immediately underneath the episcopal apart-
ment. In the morning his Gaiters expressed
his approval of the general arrangements
made for his comfort, f but complained that
he had passed a very disturbed night. “Still,
your industry is altogether to your credit,”
said his Lordship loftily—“l heard you work-
ing your typewriter in your office nearly the
whole night through !”
“Dido” : He came out of a Swans ton-street
bar the other afternoon, and stood in the
doorway, a tall, thin man with a nose like
a slim dromedary, an Adam’s apple to match
and a long, drooping, straw-colored mous-
tache that failed to disguise his two front
teeth. His clothes ran to strings, and his
boots would not hold water. In fact, they
would not -hold
potatoes. He was
drawing on a pair
of yellow gloves
that had no fingers
to speak of, and
as a great touring-
car bowled along
he held up a hand
in a commanding
way. The car
Went on. Came a
neat little single-
seater. He held
up his hand again
impressively, al-
most imperiously.

times he held up

_ “Smike”: The Anglican church authori-
ties in Melbourne are again in trouble.
While endeavoring to still the small voice
of suspicion regarding their alleged desire
to import a new bishop, they have to cone
with another delicate situation up at St.
John’s, Latrobe-street. The pilot of that
dingy fane is said to be High Church, and
apparently through refusing to throw Jus
Madonnas and crucifixes into the dust-bin
lie has been ordered to quit the church
and make room for a Low Churcher. This
action has caused an outburst of anguish
in the flock, which finds many points of
interest in the shepherd. For dde thing;
hd has ihcreased the congregation and
brought a ldt more cash into the plate, and
a man who can perform this miracle these
times is desirable. The crowd is now
talking to Vicar-General Hindley; but appa-

rently he is too absorbed in the appoint-
ment of the new bishop to devote his mind
to a mere matter of ritual. So far the
Election Board cannot agree on a
parson to succeed to the vacant gaiters at St.
Paul’s. It is known that two or three Aus-
tralians possess all the dignity and scholar-
ship required, but the selection committee
apparently feels that it would be parochial
to appoint an Australian if anybody else
can be got. Accordingly, if Professor Mere-
dith Atkinson can be spared from the Uni-
versity, he will presently set out to report
on the eligibles who are found to be less
inferiah than the Australians offering.

William Hutchinson a century ago was
Superintendent of Convicts, and managed
to secure various desirable city properties;
the S.E. corner of King and George streets
was one of them. Bond-street, originally
known as Hutchinson-street, was run
through another of “Old Hutch’s” proper-
ties. When the King and George streets
corner became too valuable for a private
residence, the old gaoler moved to a house,
more like a stronghold than a private resi-
dence, which he had built further out in the
bush. Here he died in 1847. The house
was later occupied by' Dr. Jonathan Croft,
an old Imperial officer, and later for a time
by the Inspector-General of Police. As the
Belmore Markets developed the private resi-
dence was turned into a pub, which later
gave way to the Hotel Chamberlain, sold
the other day for £50,000. Adjoining proper-
ties brought the total up to the afore-
mentioned £SO,OOO.
“PjjX.”: A King’s Bench decision in Eng-
land promises to put an end to an old trick
for muzzling the press. No sooner has a
decision been given in a case involving a
matter of public interest than notice of
appeal has been lodged, with the idea of
silencing critics until the matter has ceased
to have any public interest. It hasn’t been
a question of libel. There is a libel law,
and a newspaper knows pretty well what the
lines are that it must not overstep. But
contempt of court is a much more uncertain
animal. What is and what is not contempt
depends very largely upon an individual
Judge’s temperament—and his liver, which
isn’t open for public inspection, comes into
that. Nine times out of 10 or thereabouts
the appeal is not proceeded with. It is
bluff in most of the nine cases. But it has
served. Now, however, the King’s Bench,
having been asked to declare Lloyd George
guilty of contempt for commenting on an
Irish case in which notice of appeal had
been given, roared with great emphasis that
once a court of competent jurisdiction has
dealt with a ffa&fe, the matter is qjjen fd
coinmferit tiiat is otherwise Within thd law,
The nation hasn’t had much td thank the
little Welsh opportunist for during the last
couple of years, whatever his previous ser-
vices under very different circumstances;
but he has been the means of calling an
Impudent bluff that has hitherto stopped
criticism many a time when criticism has
been badly nedeed.
* * * *
In one case, anyhow, among the Christmas*
crop of murders the force was not left with-
out a clue. As the Telegraph capably put
it, the man who was walking along a street
in North Sydney was himself an ex-police-
man, so he “by force of habit naturally
observed all that passed.” A man and
woman passed :
“It is very hot,” the woman remarked.
“Yes,” was the man’s answer.
, “You had better come in and have a drink,” she
suggested.
Soon after this simple but first-class conver-
sation, the woman, or a similar one, was
found in the house next to the observant
ex-policeman’s. Practically all the crockery
in the tenement had been smashed on her
head in dead silence, and she had also been
strangled several times. Clues, gory finger-
marks and broken bottles lay around in
muffled confusion. No attempt .seems to
have been made to tear down the side of the
house, and the only sign of robbery was some
NOTHING CONCEALED ABOUT IT.
THE MOUSE : “One can read her character
by her face.”
THE CAT : “Yes, it’s plain enough.”
bloodstained water in a basin. Somebody
remembered having seen a young man with
a red blot on his shirt —a young man who
looked hot—leave the house. So the clue
which began with that ably-reported conver-
sation in the street steadily lengthened till
it looked like the shadow of a giant at
sunset.
THE YEAR END.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On this little bridge,
Sunset on yon ridge,
Stood I, eyes aglow,
Long—-how long ago!
Who shall only bring
To Lile s reckoning
Clock or calendar,
March of moon or star?
Though Time be content
With staid measurement,
Numbered are the years
By our hopes and tears.
Oh, how lit was all
Life’s high festival
In the dim and far
Years before the war!
Under plank and pier,
On the waters clear
Drifted leaf and flower
In that far-off hour.
What is this that brings
Dim rememberings
Paling all with grief—
Is it flower and leaf?
Nay, though flower and
leaf—,
Brief, and all too brief!—
Fall from branch
Grief is not for them.
Rather ’tis to those
Who as men arose,
And as heroes follght,
That 1 give my thought.
They were dreagiers, too,
Splendid dreams they
knew;
Dreamers, doers all,
Glorious was their fall!
On this little bridge,
Twilight on yon ridge,
Stand I now, once more,
As I stood of yore.
’Twixt this hour and then
Lie the graves of men,
Making, each and all,
Wide the interval.
Vanished is the glow
Of the Long Ago,
And the fair and far
Years before the war.
Youth and love have gone,
Gone the joy that shone,
Fresh’nihg all the world
To a rose, dew-pearled.
Though we yedrrt and
yearn,
Time may hot return,
Nor, on any day,
June put back to May.
On the waters glide
Swiftly to the tide;
Pausing in its track.
Ne’er a leaf drifts back!

AEOLIAN HALL,
NEW YORK
HEADQUARTERS AND FACTORY ORGANISATION OF THE PIANOLA COMPANY PTY. LTD.
CONFIDENCE
is the corner-stone of the
entire commercial edifice !
p
ARTICULARLY in the piano business is confidence an essential to successful business.
Ninety-nine persons out of a hundred do not possess sufficient knowledge to appraise
correctly the comparative value of different player-pianos.
Therefore, when purchasing a player-piano, the great majority of people are compelled to trust
somebody. The conspicuous success of the Pianola Company (in selling pianos containing the Pianola
as well as pianos without it) has been attained by the confidence inspired in the music-loving public.
This is due not only to the high character of the instruments produced by the ‘Pianola Company, but also
by the sound principles under which these instruments are sold. Our platform from the beginning has
been equal treatment to all.
There are no concessions obtainable by one purchaser that are not open to all. Every
price-tag on a Piano or a Pianola at Pianola Hall means exactly what it says.
In stores which have a secret, sliding scale of prices, you can never be sure of any-
thing. It is not a sound business principle to price a piano so high that there is room for
an elastic system of special discounts and rebates. If you are offered a secret discount,
how can you know that some more favored purchaser is not receiving a much larger
discount ?
It is by strict observance of methods which retain public confidence that
a chain of Pianola Branches, extending around the world, has been made
possible, and the largest business in the entire music industry has been created.

ARTHUR J. USHER,

From a man who has been there:—
The Australian Graves Department at Poperinghe
(Belgium) and in France is doing wonderful work.
At the former place Major Allen (well known in
Sydney), with a band of a dozen or so lads, is still
recovering the bodies of our dead. From eight to
10 is the daily average, and the system of identi-
fication is absolutely thorough, bodies having in some
cases been exhumed three times for the purpose of
following some fresh clue. The official discs, the
Major says, are not always of service, owing to the
perishable material of which some, at any rate, were
made. At the time of our
'-pit, in August, a good many
Australian visitors were seek-
ing the graves of husbands,
brothers and sons, and un-
stinted praise was bestowed
NOW, WHAT HAS SHE GOT TO SAY
TO THAT?
WIFEY: “There's no use talking, I am
positive that you were drinking last
night!"
HUBBY: “Well, if I was, how is it that I am
so thirsty this morning ?”
by them upon the men engaged in a task that is
sacred but not pleasant. Australia, which has a habit
of forgetting, should not forget these lads.
* * * *
“Smike”: “Jack Carse’s” wild paragraph
(B. 9/12/’2O) needs putting right in. some
important particulars. The Alfred Hospital
"is neither extravagant nor old-fashioned. It
is one of the best-equipped hospitals not only
in the State, but in Australia, and the charge
of extravagance carries no weight when a
competent hospital manager who had exten-
sive war experience has control of the cash-
box. But the main point I want to make is
that the Alfred Hospital people had nothing
to do with the suggestion of an operating
theatre. The proposal came from a committee
at the Town Hall supported by the Taits.
J. C. Williamson, Ltd., Hugh Mclntosh and
other theatricals; and as they were footing
most of the bill, they were entitled to say how
the money should be spent. No doubt there
THE FRIENDLY GAME.
“Never since, we've been
married have my hus-
band and I agreed,
about anything."
“Well, why don't you leave him?"
“Oh, I don't know; I suppose it is because
I’d hate always having to argue with
strangers."
are other deserving ways of perpetuating Flo
Young’s memory, but “Carse” won’t change
the donors’ ambitions by working up bogus
horrors about operating theatres. With all
its aesthetic drawbacks and its lack of the
sentimenal obviousness which our “Jack”
wants in the memorial to an actress, an
operating theatre is a dashed useful thing to
the unfortunates who cannot pay for surgical
attention.

“Dido” : A South Yarra romance. There
was a big, good-looking woman, still too
young altogether to be the mother of two
such full-grown daughters. * The two
daughters were rather better than passable,
and Sprowle had been going to the house,
week-days and Sundays, for over three
months before it was quite definitely under-
stood which he wanted to marry. He settled
all doubts by marrying the mother. Com-
plications followed. Each daughter thought
she had been jilted and consulted a solicitor,
and poor Sprowle was asked to nominate the
gent, one who would receive service on his
behalf in connection with breach-of-promise
actions. The matters stopped short of the
court, because the girls were per-
suaded by relatives that the situation
would be altogether too ridiculous.
Sprowie, explaining his conduct,
admitted that he had been attentive
to Grace, and on the whole had given
Henrietta reason to entertain tender
hopes. “However, I came to the con-
elusion that Ellen” (the mother) “would be
an abominable mother-in-law,” said he, “so
I married her.”
“Copabella”: For the disarming tarra-
diddle glibly handed out as evidence, no
court equals that of licensing jurisdiction.
This one comes from Geelong (Vic.). Found
on the premises after hours, a seafarer
explained that his duty was to watch over
the lights which mark the port channel. An
excellent view of these could be obtained
from a sea-view pub, so he had acquired a
kind of habit of going to that pub’s corner
—which had thus become a station on his
beat. At times Mrs. Public-house would
look out of her door about the time he w r ould
be passing, and they would chat together.
Unbelieving police butted in upon one of
these chats, which was taking place, as it
chanced, near the open-after-hours bar. A
Bench that had no imagination siyd “Forty
bob.”
“A.J.”: It was at Lemnos prior to the
Gallipoli landing. The smart boy of the
village was a Greek, who had spent some
months in America and acQuired a little
English and a lot of twang. Three of us
went along one night to buy "Some wine from
him. It was bright moonlight, and there
seemed to be rather a mob at the door. We
discovered six or eight coldly-infuriated Dig-
gers clustered round our Greek friend, who
was on his knees raising passionate hands
to the starry heavens, ilis voice also was
raised. “No, by my God, Australia,” he
howled, “sure, I swear it—it was not kero-
sene.” We decided to remain thirsty.
♦ * * *
“8.G.”: Things were as bad as could be in
El Kuneitra just before the Armistice.
Rations were still “iron” —“bully and bik-
kies” for the man and a hatful of
grain per day for the horse. Requisi-
tioning officers had requisitioned until
there was nothing edible in sight.
The General was getting tired of his
morning reviews
of dusky complain-
ants, some a sheep
short and nothing
to show for the
deficiency, others a
sheep short and a
s c reed reading
“Kick this impos-
tor hard.” I suppose" he still
wonders where we found all
those things. One, night a
Digger sighted a load of hay
from the hills entering the vil-
lage. He followed the ox-
waggon and saw it unloaded.
The following night 30 men
made three trips each, and a
troop of horses enjoyed the best
feed they had had since leaving
Queensland. The sergeant, an
early riser, saw a trail of hay
from the horse-lines to the vil-
lage, thought of a possible life-
sentence, and turned the troop
out. On the other side of the
stone wall was another troop, whose
picket was doing its watch in bed. Eager
hands untied the sleepers' horses and set
them on the trail. Within an hour the
incriminating line was erased. The
General had his usual review that morn-
mg, but —horses never tell.

Act 111. (at the street corner) :
He was standing, balanced on the kerb of the
main street of an Australian metropolis, a tall,
attenuated man, hollow-eyed, hollow-cheeked, in a
sadly strained suit, fringed at the heels. His hat
was a disgrace, and his boots gaped. He leaned upon
a stick, and seemed interested in nothing and nobody,
till a closed-in motor-car drove up, and stopped
with the door at his elbow. A face appeared at the win-
dow, the pale face of a woman. The man looked at
her a moment, and then he said: “Three cheers for
Miss ,” using the name of a once-popular actress.
He gave the three cheers himself, sotto voce. “You!”
she said. Her quick eye went over him. “You—
here!” She dropped back into the car, and
presently a hand appeared, and three crumpled notes
were pushed out. The man looked at the money,
folded it carefully, and, while the white face at
the window watched’ him, crossed the footpath, and
dropped it into the tin of a blind man sitting against
a shop wall. Then he stood erect, squared his
shoulders, and, holding his chin high, walked clown
the street.
Melodramatic ; but it happened.
* * * *
“8.C.”: “616’s” reference to the .scarab
(B. 16/12/’2O) reminds me of the summer
we spent at Wadi Gliuzze, in Southern
Palestine. To secure protection from
bomb-splinters, and to increase the dimen-
sions of their bivvies, Diggers dug holes
about three feet in depth and put up
bivouac-sheets over the cavities. When the
little scavengers found our horse-lines,
shovels were needed to clean out the bivvies.
The scarab would select his dinner at the
horse-lines and retire with it until trapped
by the holes; then both scarab and load
fell to the floor. Many devices were tried
to deal with the nuisance, but the most
effective was a trench around the bivvy.
The flat of a shovel kept the scarab popula-
tion down, but this made trouble with the
Gyppos, to whom the wretched beetle is
sacred.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: The infantry was taught many
things before it .was sent into the line,
but nobody told us anything to speak of
about the various brands of murder that
were waiting for us there. Of course, we
soon learnt; but the learning might have
been costly. One of my early jobs was to
help clear up an old artillery possie—the
work came to us during a “rest” period. I
didn’t then know that a time-fuse on a
shell that had become a dud might resume
business if the dud.was shifted; and I was
wandering cheerfully with a dud-shell on
my shoulder to the dump at the roadside
when I noticed something queer about the
Ordnance men who were checking the shells.
They swore venomously, and dived into holes
when they saw me coming. One of them
yelled anguished advice to me to dump the
blanky thing into a shell-hole and get for
my life. I lost no time. The shell plunked
into a hole half-filled with water as I sped
in the other direction. In the circumstances
the explosion wasn’t as spectacular as it
might have been, but if it had occurred on
my shoulder it would have saved The Bul-
letin accountant some trouble.
* * * *
‘ Sixenate”: My charlady is a husband-
beater. I have seen her beating him —and
no doubt he deserved it. It occurred when
the lady had retrieved him from the local
pub. He was in such a condition that she
had to hold him up; and every now and
again she walloped him heartily ; and, when
lie feebly protested, she did it with compound
interest added. The next time she washed
at the "Sixenate” mansion she confided to
me that “I give the old man a terrible ’iding
wen I got ’im ,’ome.” Then she explained
her seeming cruelty to the being she had
sworn to honor and obey. She is in the
habit of giving her lord a hiding every time
he gets drunk ; but he never remembers any-
thing about it. When he sobers up and
discovers his body is a mass of bruises, he
decides that he must have struck a heap of
trouble when he was'boozed, and it makes
bun afraid of beer. “An’ ’e don’t got
blithered again as long as ’e ’as a bruise on
im to remind ’im of what ’appens,” the
matron said. After all, a man who gets so
drunk that he ceases to have the satisfaction
of knowing he is drunk deserves all that
comes to him.
* * * *
“Jarrahlander” on politics and art: —
My friend Demetrius, the Athenian, is gloomily
wondering how the restoration of Tino will affect
the steak-and-da-oyst industry. Great events from
trivial causes spring, and just as a caprice of
fashion in Paris can bankrupt a colony of weavers
in Japan, or a settlement of trappers in Alaska, or
of bird-pluckers in Papua, so the reappearance in
a third-rate Levantine town of an elderly bloke
with a, spiky moustache may depress the consump-
tion of stewed oysters and boiled snapper in Aus-
tralia. In short, the return of Tino may mean
for Demetrius and his swarthy tribe a return to
191 1, and to tumultuous days of broken windows,
flying crockery and unpaid-for suppers, and the
prospect is too exciting to be pleasant. Yet even
in 191 1, when the hilarity of an exuberant soldiery
bad exhausted itself, Demetrius, as he ruefully recalls,
could borrow surcease from strife by proclaiming
himself a Venizelist. Fervent became the devo-
tion of the fried-fish trade to the Cretan and liis
cause. A highly-discolored portrait of the liberator
appeared in every fly-specked window. It was at
once a pledge of loyalty and a never-failing talis-
man against trouble. But Venizelos has been dished,
and his homely features have lost their potency. Por-
traits of Venizelos have becorfie a drug in the fish
market, and the outlook for Demetrius and his
brethren so it appears to their uneasy imagina-
tions is as black as Kcmbla pit. This accounts
for the peculiar behavior of Demetrius in his fish-
joint the other night. With tears in his eyes and
a flaring oleograph of the bald-headed islander in
THE LUCKY KID.
“ Oh, John, this paper says every third baby
born in the world is a Chinese
“Good Lord, is that so! Thank goodness this
is our first."
liis hand, he besought Shader, the caricaturist, to alter
Venizelos to Alphonso of Spain or Peter of Servia
or Emanuel of Italy for three and six in cash and
two pounds of fried leatherjacket to take home.
The suggestion was obvious: Demetrius is anxious
to assume the nationality of and transfer his loyal
rapture to any neutral or pro-ally ruler whose linea-
ments can be made to blend with those of the
bearded Cretan. I fear he over-rates the resources
and under-rates the rewards of art, but the contract
is open, for a consideration, to all unemployed cubists
and colorists, house-painters by no means excluded.
Shader declined it. ■
IN THE DISTANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The big trains thunder down the line,
The yawning people gaze and see
A distant roof and window-shine
Half-hidden by a pepper-tree.
A little patch of tufted corn,
An old grey fence, three cows on grass—
The engine makes a noise of scorn,
The gazers gape, the swift wheels pass.
I often look upon this scene;
And as it fades 1 softly sigh
And think of things that might have been
If wheels could move less harshly by.
Ah, Jane, I saw last Tuesday morn
One added feature to the view,
Across the grass, across the com,
A slim, high petticoat of blue.
The wind had raised the airy thing.
The striped and distant bannerette
Tossed on the line appeared to sing
A silent song of long regret.
So slim, so blue, yet distant far,
I guessed whose hands had washed it fair —
Oil, happy waist, where clothes-pegs bar
The fondling fingers of the air!
Down the long vistas of my dream
Old longings stir at night and morn;
I see the distant window gleam,
I notice both the cows and corn.
The big trains thunder up the line ;
And still and still I gaze and see
The girl who never can be mine
VY hose home is near a pepper-tree.
Alas, alas, and still alas!
She might be Jane, she might be Sue,
The girl whose home I often pass
Who wears a petticoat of blue.
But does she wear it? Ah, sad heart,
Distance is vague; its visions tease.
It might have been —the slow tears start—
Bill’s working shirt upon the breeze.

A Glass of Bubbling
SAL HEPATICA
before breakfast means
continuous Good Health
Sal Hepatica has been known as the happy home medicine because
it is so pleasant and beneficial. A spoonful in a glass of water
makes a sparkling saline drink that tastes good and keeps you well.
Headache in the morning, biliousness, indigestion, heartburn, and
the enervating effects of a disarranged liver are easily overcome
by Sal Hepatica. It is widely prescribed by the medical profession
as a safe and effective remedy in various stomach and liver disorders.
There is no condition that is a greater handicap to good health than Constipation,
which, if neglected, opens the way to serious illness. As a remedy for constipation
and as an eliminant of its poisons, Sal Hepatica will be found the ideal remedy,
being pleasing, safe and most efficient. Likewise with Rheumatism and Gout.
Sal Hepatica has been found of wonderful value in disposing of uric acid by its
action on the blood.
Sal Hepatica is a Pure Saline Preparation similar in laxative and tonic properties
to the well-known natural mineral waters of Europe. As a peifect aid to continuous
health Sal Hepatica is unique for young or old.

BEHNING
Drawing-
Room
GRAND
T
HE BEHNING GRAND PIANO is
an exquisite instrument with the
stamp of quality in every detail.
In brilliancy, resonance and volume of tone the
“Behning” represents the highest achievement of this
type of piano construction. The delicate responsiveness
of touch is a real aid in obtaining the finely-shaded
tone effects that add distinction to the performance
of the accomplished pianist.
The Behning Drawing-room Grand is designed to look
well in homes where space is precious. Adapted to the
acoustic properties of even small rooms, it is yet an
instrument of such exquisite tone as to invite comparison
in quality with the noblest of Concert Grands.
BEHNING GRANDS are de-
signed by artists with a view
to expressing in them, by sym-
metry of outline proportion,
that sense of richness which
best accords with their intrinsic
qualities.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“M.P.A.”: A couple of bullocks are going
round the various shows in Maoriland. The better-
conditioned is Samson, a shorthorn bred by Robert
Trotter, of Kurow. He was sold by auction at
Addington on August 4 for £204. When the tape
was run over the animal, Scotch fashion, it showed
height, 6ft. 2iin. ; length, 15ft. from tip to tip;
girth, 10ft. His weight was 35001 b. Samson
is seven years old, and is as handsome as a melo-
drama hero. It is wonderful what an attraction a
fat bullock has for Wire Whiskers. One bullock
on exhibition at these shows drew his purchase-
money inside a month.
“Try Mine”: The paths of the innocent
are strewn with thorns and broken bottles. Which
explains “Mypharry’s” advisers on tobacco-curing.
“Russo” (B. 2/12/’2O) recommends the use of salt-
petre and rum. Why saltpetre?- “Mypharry” being
a hard-working cocky—all cockies are hard-working—
will probably want a smoke that doesn’t require a
full-time stoker on duty. A pipe of “Russo’s”
tobacco would die of heart failure before the match
had been thrown away. Rum makes heavy tobacco.
Water is a good substitute if a light tobacco is
desired. I would advise “Mypharry” to pick the
leaves when they have apparently finished growth,
and when he can discern a small brown spot on the
bottom leaf. Pack them in a pyramid about two or
three feet high, in a dry, shady place. Fermentation
will commence. In, say, two days take out those
leaves from the centre that have been “colored” and
hang them in the barn to dry. Keep on removing
the colored leaves; then stem and carry on as per
“Russo’s” advice.

“Barcoo”: “Ida O.” (B. 11/11/’2O) says
he can name the four best roughriders in Australia,
but cannot reduce the selection to one. I’m not so
modest, and will name the best four horsemen of 10
years ago in their order—Skuthorpe, Waite, Kemp am
Dempsey. But I must add that this is taking into
account work both in the saddle and on the ground.
Each one of the four had his strong points. Once the
tackling was on Skuthorpe was aboard in a flash and
was there to stay, even in the plainest of “poleys.”
His horsemanship, too, was highly artistic. Waite was
the master in the attack on the ground. He went at
his horse in great style. Ilis confidence in handling
and in the adjustment of tackle seemed to mesmerise
the colt until he was mounted, and then it was too
late to protest. Waite was a sticking-plaster in the
Bananaland knee-padded stock saddle. The difference
between him and Skuthorpe was the difference between
the sticking-plaster behind kneepads and the “bal-
ance” rider on the “poley” saddle. Great as those
two were in the pigskin, when it came to a test of
barebacked horsemanship the utterly fearless “Pro-
fessor” Kemp was the master of both. He would
mount a blindfolded outlaw bareback, remove the
blind, and when the prad got to business would
discard the bridle, riding the animal to a standstill.
But unlike the other two he was “all over the roof.”
Nor was he the “heady” horsemen that the other two
were. Dempsey was the happy medium between Waite
and Kemp, and a great horseman ; yet both of them
excelled him in some points of the game.
“H. 8.”: Allow ine to enter Bob Moon,
of Buchan (Vic.), a youth of 69, for the cattle-
throwing championship. He was mustering cattle in
the Deddick country (which, by the way, is about
the roughest patch in Eastern Gippsland), when he
came up with a three-year-old Hereford bull. After
a dash down a steep, rocky siding, Moon, with a
dexterous tail-twist, overturned, the bull whilst in
full flight; then, leaping from his saddle, he “doc-
tored” the animal without the aid of ropes or
other ties. Time, 43sec. Know of any other infant
about Moon’s age who can beat this record?
“Ellenvale”: When I landed at the home-
stead I put my horse in the stable to give him a
feed. I was just going to empty the chaff into
the manger when I discovered two hens sitting, one
in each end of the manger, and a cat with seven
kittens in the centre,
so I shifted to another
stall. Next day one
hen had cleared; the
other I found fighting
the cat for possession
of the kittens. The
fowl won the argu-
ment and the cat
climbed a post and
looked to me for help.
The hen kept posses-
sion of the kittens for
some time —until they
began to cry out for
lunch. Then the cat
prepared for battle,
and she managed, after
a great struggle, to
get the infants away
one at a time. We
caught the old hen next day and put her on 15 eggs,
and she seems quite happy now she has something
to go on with.
* * * *
“Cruma”: There was one old scoundrel
of a rat that none of your patent steel-wire spring
traps would catch. We baited them with cheese,
meat, bread, anything—even soap, for which he
seemed to have a liking. Sometimes the traps went
off, sometimes they didn’t, but they never caught
Cuthbert. We got him at last with Ye Olde Bushe
Ratte-trappe. It is the most efficient I know; I
have set it at night and discovered as many as five
rats in it in the morning. Here’s the recipe for you.
You punch a hole in the lid and bottom of a small
round tin (I used a baking-powder tin) and thrdhd
a piece of fencing-wire through the two holes. Then
you attach the two ends to opposite sides of the
top of an opened-up kerosene-tin, so that the small
tin can spin round on the wire. To set it you
half-fill the kerosene tin with water and smear the
round tin with remains of steak or other such tasty
substance; finally you leave a board slanting down
to the ground from the edge of the kerosene-tin at
one end of the wire. Your rat walks up this and
out to the round tin. He can balance himself all
right on the wire till he puts his front paws on
the smeared tin; this twists round a bit and tips
him into the water. He can’t jump out if his feet
can’t reach bottom, and the sides are too smooth
for him to climb out, so it’s “Good night, nurse.”
“Exul”: “FY7” criticises (B. 9/12/’2O)
my comments on the alleged law of telegony, and is
very unconvincing. He makes the assertion —which I
did not deny—that many breeders believe in it. He
vaguely refers to the sad experience of a fox terrier
bitch “of high degree,”. without stating how far back
all the ancestors of the bitch and her second mate
had been shown to be pure-bred. I claimed that these
alleged cases of telegony were instances of ancestral
reversion and “FY7” attempts to refute my argument
by quoting as telegony' a case which is most obviously
one of reversion. Telegony by definition is confined
to one generation and one particular female animal.
The occurrence of black children in the families of
white parents who had a black ancestor three or four
HIS GOOD OPINION OF COHEN.
“Cohen's place is nothing but a heap of
ashes. What d'ye think of that?”
“Dunno , my friend, but I think it wath
probably Cohen'th ecthelent judgment."
generations ago is as plain an illustration of my
claim as could be wished for and has nothing to do
with telegony. The superstitions of breeders are
notorious and cannot stand for a moment against the
deductions of careful scientific observers. Prof. Cossar
Ewart, after his Penycuik experiments, concluded that
“the evidence of any undoubted telegony is very un-
satisfactory.” Prof. J. A. Thomson, the famous stu-
dent of evolution and heredity, holds that the case
for telegony is “non-proven” and believes the apparent
cases of it to be due to normal variation or ancestral
reversion. (If the law held we should expect also each
succeeding child of one pair of parents to approach
more and more closely to the paternal type; we do
not find this to occur.) I quote a counter-case to
that of his fox-terrier bitch. A pair of bluish
Japanese kittens with no tabby ancestors was taken to
England. The first pregnancy was to a common tabby
and resulted in a mongrel litter. The second was to
the Jap mate, and showed no trace of the tabby’s
influence. “FY7” does not recognise the difficulty of
being sure of* the purity of the breeds. To go back
10 generations only, his “fox” bitch has had up to
2046 aricestors. So also has her second “pure-bred”
mate. Will he swear that none of these 4092 was
a retriever? Until he can do that and more, as 10
generations is not the limit of ancestral influence,
he cannot reasonably maintain that telegony is any
more than a damaging superstition.
* * * *
“Vailima”: Cephalotus, the Westralian
pitcher-plant, is a beautiful little vegetable, found
only in the neighborhood of Albany, and related to
the N. S. Wales Christmas bush. It has a ring of
brilliantly-colored little pitchers, each about half an
inch long and provided with a lid. Ceph. is a very
efficient insect-trap, anti I have seen dozens of the
little pitchers each containing at least a teaspoonful
of the mortal remains of its numerous victims, it
is provided with a number of ingenious contrivances to
attract insects, and to prevent their escape when
they have entered the pitchers. One curious point
about it is that each pitcher is inhabited by a
number of larvae of a fly of the March-fly family.
The adult fly is able to enter the trap, deposit its
eggs and escape without any trouble. The larvae
live upon the insects caught by the plant. It is
remarkable that they should be able to live in the
fluid of the pitchers, which has the power of digest-
ing other insects. But it is not a solitary instance.
The forked sundew, which has been flowering very
freely in Sydney Centennial Park, usually has one
or more bugs on its leaves, living on the insects
caught by the plant for its own food. 1 also saw
on byblis, a Westralian insect-catcher, a bug closely
resembling the suhdew-bug and having similar habits.
Instances of the same thing have been observed in
the true pitcher-plants ( Nepenthes ) and other
insect-catchers.
Australia gets an unexpected look-in in a
puzzle propounded by London Strand. Problem, to
name a word in which five vowels occur one after
the other. Answer: “Cooeeing.” The editor, evi-
dently thinking that readers may doubt if the word
is part of the English language, carefully explains
what it means.
“Ragar” : Recently died in Torres Strait
an ancient Rarotongan whose memory of his early
days was still green in his old age. His father was a
noted fisherman ; so, according to the custom of burial
of medicine-man, king, priest or chief fisherman, he
was planted for three days and then dug up. His head
was cut off and a eocoanut
planted in its place, after
which the body was cov-
ered with earth again. The
head was kept in a palm-
leaf basket and secured in
the bows of a canoe, where
it was supposed to act as
a sort of sea-god who
brought good luck to the
fishing. In the fishing sea-
son, which lasted four
months September to
December—each canoe was
fitted with a eocoanut frond
t>ed to the bows, and no
canoe would dare to ven-
ture out beyond the reef
without this protecting
charm. If the canoe was
caught in bad weather the
head was taken from the
basket and held aloft,
while the crew chanted
prayers to the particular
god who was supposed to
be looking after their in-
terests. The boats of the
more distant relatives
v'ould at times use the
hands and feet of the dear
departed in the same way,
the crew placing as much
faith in these less impor-
tant relies as the nearer
relations did on the head.
After the removal of the
head from the grave, and
f he. planting of the cocoa-
nut, the site was tabu,
and as the young palm
grew it was carefully
guarded. The nuts from
these trees were never eaten
by the islanders, but were reserved for the use of
strangers or visitors calling there.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Writing of the peaceful sig-
nals used when chumming up with strange savages,
“Laloki” (B. 9/12/’2O) says that Macgregor, of
8.N.G., relied on “waving g'reen branches.” But
the old boy always kept his powder dry. That
green-branch business is popular with the unsophis-
ticated savage, but does not always mean peace. I
have known it used as a range-finder by the Good-
enough Islanders, and they opened up in style with
a “five rounds rapid” from their long slings when
we had come close enough to them. Macgregor
may have quietened the Collingwood Bay cannibals
with a Waterbury watch. But he also cut off a
great raiding party which had ascended the Musa
River, and after what he did to them they were as
good as gold—those that ever got back home through
the sago swamps. For all his solicitude for the
native, old Billy always kept in mind the advice of
Polonius as translated by Mulvaney: “Niver look
f’r trouble; but whin ye’re in ut, hit th’ nose av’
um first an’ frequint.”
* * * *
“Cab”: Two more of the old Burrendong
(N.S.W.) horsemen, Geo. Dutfield and Bill Turner,
have ridden beyond the sunset. George was 69 and
Bill 71, and in their day they were great mountain
and buckjump riders, like ail their fellowship. The
horse was never foaled that could throw Jim

When I pass the footmen sweatin’ under swags through

With their blistered trilbies peepin’ through the

I am proud to see their envy as they does the toe an’

An’ their looks of admiration at my ancient splnnin’
wheel.

Mine has got it’s second wind by bein’ stuffed with

Pace counts more than paint or polish when the bush-

Melts the rubber in the ragged tyres that sprint with
you from Death
Over tracks that God created on his first rough sketch
an’ plan—
That’s when flash machines would let you roast among

An’ yer only livin’ company is mobs of watcliin’

Where the binde-i, like carpet tacks, lies thick upon

Use Cocoanut Oil
For Washing' Hair.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most soaps
and ready-mixed shampoos contain excessive
quantities of alkali. This dries the scalp,
makes the hair brittle and is very injurious.
Just ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponified but quite greaseless liquid) is
far better than the most costly soap you could
possibly use for a shampoo, for this cannot
possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub. it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful makes a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and cleanses
both hair and scalp thoroughly. The lather
rinses out easily, and takes with it every trace
of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive oiliness.
The hair dries quickly and evenly, and comes
out fine and silky, bright, glossy and fluffy,
appearing to be heavier than it is. And best
of all, this colinated cocoanut oil leaves the
hair as easy to dress again as though you
hadn’t washed it at all. You can get colinated
cocoanut oil at most any chemist, but be sure
it’s “colinated,” wlych is not expensive—a few
ounces lasting a long, long time.
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated oil, as recommended above.

If Favorite Foods
Upset Stomach
Take Magnesia.
If some of the foods you like best do not
agree with you and make your stomach sour
or burn, producing acid indigestion, do not
think you must give up eating these good
things, and do not, either, make the mistake
of swallowing pepsin pills or soda water after
every meal. Instead just make a practice of
taking a teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia
in half a glass of hot water right after eating
The hot water will force a needed blood
supply to your stomach, and the Salix Mag-
nesia will instantly neutralise any excess of
stomach acid, and your digestion will bp
natural and painless. Salix Magnesia is not
a laxative, and its continued use is entfrelv
harmless, as it never weakens natural diges
tion. It can be obtained at any well-stocked
chemist’s shop (in powder or compressed tab
lets form). Be sure to get Salix Magnesia Do
not use other forms of magnesia for this
purpose.
‘‘Balfour”: In the early ’eighties Forbes
(N.S.W.) had a well-known inhabitant, Bupdaburra
•Tacky. At language and liquor Bundaburra was never
beaten, and he was a frequent guest at the local lock-
up. One day, outside a pub, Parson Dunkin, noticing
the abo., walked across to him. “Now, Jacky,” he
said, “why don’t you give up this bad life and be a
good man? Then when you die you shall go to Heaven
and be an angel.” “Could I fly to Mr. Strickland’s,
Mr. Dunkin?” asked Bundaburra. (Mr. Strickland
was Bundaburra’s old and favored boss.) “Certainly,
Jaclcy,” replied the parson. “An’ could 1 fly to the
Parkes an’ Forbes races, Mr. Dunkin?” “Yes, Jacky,
you could—if you wanted to. Now what do you think
about it?” “Well, Mr. Dunkin, I think it’s better
than plurry-well walkin’.”

“Biologist”: “Mirza” (B. 2/12/’2O) can’t
say whether a turtle lives six hours after being
killed. The only individual life is the cell; and
an organism like the turtle is a conglomeration of
cell lives, the brain being a group of cells control-
ling its later-evolved organs. Organs evolved before
the brain are self-directed and often self-sufficing if
properly fed. Thus when a garden worm is cut in
two the head half grows a new tail and the tail
half a new head. Dr. Carrol experimented with the
heart of a fowl: it continued to function for weeks
after amputation; and a piece of skin from the same
bird continued to grow. A common fact relating to
this matter is the growth of Hair and nails after
death.

Werrimee : Two northern aborigines
were recently poisoned through drinking out of a tin
that had been used by Government workmen for
mixing arsenic. The same thing has probably killed
many a swagman. Travellers generally pull up where
others have camped by the roadside, and plenty of
those place have been lately used by dingo scalpers,
’possum snarers and bunny slaughterers. Tins used
for mixing or carrying poison are thrown down any-
where, and unsuspecting persons, wanting a vessel
for some temporary purpose, pick them up. Clean
baking-powder tins, which look innocent enough, are
often used for carrying arsenic, perhaps for washing
skins as a protection against vermin. At one old
camp I found a bottle of strychnine stuck in the fork of
SIMPLY COINING MONEY.
THE YOUNG 'UN: “Can’t make it out-
frightful lot of side these hens are
puttin' on lately!”
THE OLD BIRD : “Well, you can’t wonder at
it. Think of what eggs have been fetch-
ing.”
a tree. Another time, on dismounting at a small water-
hole on Connulpie Downs (N.S.W.), I noticed a strip
of tin lying on the ground with “Poisoned Water”
painted on it. The notice had been insecurely tacked
to a tree. But even if it had been ever so plain to see,
what good would it have been to a thirsty aborigine
or a white wanderer who couldn’t read? This way-
back carelessness with poison wants hitting with a
legislative sledge-hammer.
“Wee Bobbie”: The othei 1 morning on the
Guadalcanar coast, Solomon Islands. I saw the fin of
a shark short-tacking in the shallow water. Suddenly
there was a commotion, the water being torn about
as if a propeller was underneath doing 500 revs.
AS IT WAR IN THE BEGINNING.
JIM (looking at window display of sketchy evening “creations”) : “I say, Bill, why do
they call ’em ‘Fall Fashions’?”
B ILL: “I dunno. I suppose it’s a sling-off at Eve.”
I grabbed the .44 and, hurrying along the beach,
had a couple of shots at the whirlpool. As the
row stopped I thought I had killed or at least
wounded whatever it was, so put out the dingy to
investigate. After a look round we found the
corpse of a seven-foot shark with its tail-end ' gone.
That afternoon a native came and told me there
was an alligator asleep on the beach. I got the
rifle, crawled for about 300 yards on my hands
and knees, waited until I ceased panting, took care-
ful aim and fired. The alligator stopped. When
I went down I found that he had been dead some
time. A shark had bitten a hole in his stomach,
and part of the shark we had found in the morning
was still inside. The alligat'or is top-dog in shallow
water, but has a very poor chance in deep. Sharks
are supposed to hunt in couples, and the deceased
shark’s mate had evidently had a snaf) at the alli-
gator.

“Paul C.” : The little fly calls attention to
himself just now. He is with you from dawn till
dark. He seems to have no settled abode. You may
ride 50 miles in a day, and he’ll accompany you all
the distance. He’ll bog about in any filth and then
promenade across your pudding without
washing his feet. He’ll engage in mixed
bathing in your beer or in high diving
into your soup. His unremitting atten-
tion causes you to place obstacles of
shocking language between you and Para-
dise. Being driven almost frantic by
about a million of him in massed forma-
tion as I rode along, I swore in my beard
that I would leave him behind. I was
mounted on a Cup winner, so I bashed
my tormentors off me with a bush, and
then set sail for half a mile. I found
some kept leisurely buzzing along by my
ears, while others circled round me as I rode. I
pulled up in disgust, and several thousands that had
gone on in front nearly knocked me off the horse as
they flew back to see what was detaining me.

“A.R.S.”: The absent-minded bullocky
referred to by “A.C.R.” (B. 9/12/’2O) was matched
by a country parson who, by the way, was father-in-
law of one of our present N. S. Wales M’s.L.C. When
visiting members of his flock, which he did per
horseback, he invariably, if the calling places were
handy, led the animal, with the reins slung loosely
over his shoulder, himself in deep thought. One day
he was on his rounds, and was pulled up by a friend
who inquired where his horse was. He had dragged
the bridle along for half a mile from his previous
call. It had slipped off the horse, which was duly
found grazing contentedly by the roadside.
“Montalex”: I can confirm “Bill R.” (B.
2/12/’2O) about the absurdity of that fox-tiger-cat
yarn. The so-called tiger-cat is more vicious -than
plucky, and has no claws that can do any damage.
While living in the Dandenong Ranges (Vie.) I had
a small bull-terrier that used to quest round after
dark, for “tigers,” and never had any difficulty in
demolishing one, though he didn’t always find it
quite so easy with the smaller spotted species. Pity
these animals have been mis-named cats. The family,
DasyuHdce —quite unrelated to the Felidce— ranges in
size from the “spotty” aforesaid (D. maculatus) up
to the Thylacinus, which—about the height of a
retriever-dog—was called, from its sharply-striped
hind-quarters, the Tasmanian tiger. The Tasmanian
devil (D. ursinus) is about the ugliest of the family,
and carries probably as much fiend to the square-inch
as any created thing.

“Karee”: I don’t know how long a turtle
lives after losing its head, but I guillotined one on
Stewart Island, and when I passed by its head the
next morning it snapped at my pants. I know, for
a fact, that if you poke any individual piece of sea-
turtle, chopped up for the frying-pan two days
after the original owner has gone ad patres , it will
shudder like Billy Hughes at Mahon’s disloyalty.

“10-2-4” on a disastrous storm :
Meteoiologists and the weather-wise generally may
talk or “the Dandenong year” or “the Maitland
year, but to us it will alwavs be “MacPib’s vear”
or alternatively “that time old MacPib got blind.”
the Rev. Horace MacPib only ministered to our
comi «unity at intervals, his spiritual
O.H.Q. being about a dozen miles up the road
°urs is one of those quiet little centres whose
residents live by purloining each other’s fowls during
the winter months, and on city visitors throughout
the summer. But to MacPib it was a place of sen-
sational wickedness. When the fruiterer’s daughter
took out her affiliation order against the “generally
useful ’ at the pub he drove down and preached a
special sermon on the fate of the Cities of the
Ilain. “Drunkards, blasphemers and Sabbath-
breakers —such was his estimate of us. As a result
he was unpopular, and at the time the great storm
broke bis regular congregation numbered but seven.
Ihe lake used to rise and lap the frail wooden
foundations of the MacPib tabernacle even after
normal rains. It was at the back door adjoining the
altar before our record gale was half-through. De-
ceived by a lull in the weather the sainted man
arrived and the faithful seven poured into the church
after him as usual. On the verandah of the pub
which surmounts a little crest near-by sat most of
the male adults of the district and marvelled at the
ways of the religious. The wind howled and the rain
teemed with renewed vigor, almost drowning the
wails of the harmonium and of those who were sing-
mf it over the way. “She’s rising fast,” said
old Bill Doyle, whom MacPib had several times com-
pared to Heliogabalus; “I never saw her come up like
it before.” The reference was to the lake, which
was indeed stealing with astonishing speed over the
swampy ground on which the little church stood.
A fresh blast, of unprecedented violence, screamed
past. “By God, she’s off!” yelled Harry Dobbs,
orunkard and unlicensed plumber. The assemblage
saw the kennel-like edifice which contained their
fellow-villagers and the pastor swing drunkeniv
round and make off, slightly down at the head,
across the raging waters of the lake.
Gone now was all memory of the unfortunate cleric's
harsh words, gone all resentment at the superior moral
attitude taken up by his flock. The watchers
swarmed into the tempest like a raiding party their
objective being O’Halloran’s boatshed. Bv the time
the water-logged four-oared skiffs were off the slips
the church was a hundred yards away, and gaining
impetus every minute. The distorted countenance of
AlacPib appeared momentarily at a window. Bill
Doyle s aunt was seen to wave from the front door,
which was now the strange craft’s stern. Immediately
afterwards, the angle proving too acute, no doubt,
she slid abruptly back. By the time the rescue
party drew alongside, the building, ballasted by
70 or 80 stone of humanity, was practically sailing
on its head.
One by one the half-drowned worshippers were
hooked out. MacPib was reached last. “He’s dead,”
said Doyle. “They bin standing on him. He’s
drowned.” “This’ll fix him,” said pushing a
bottle half-full of rum into the divine’s dripping
whiskers. MacPib shuddered. “Give ’im some
more,” urged Doyle; “it’s bringing him round.”
MacPib was dosed at intervals during the weary
struggle back to the boatshed ; and before a fire at
the pub he was given dry clothes and hot brandy,
“How is it?” asked Dobbs after a time. “Bonze,”
hiccupped the cleric, transformed by the magic
alchemy of alcohol from Savanorola to Falstaff.
“Never felt better. Gimme another.” All too
generous hands ministered to him, and presently he
slept heavily, and was undressed and put to bed.
Rightly has it been said that a great storm up-
roots more things than Chinese gardens and the
chimneys of jerry-built villas.

“Ragar”: Re death-adders, and others of
that ilk, stinging with their tails. There is nothing
for them to sting with in that part of their anatomy.
The idea probably originated in the movement made
by the insect when striking. He qurves himself up,
head to tail, and then, suddenly straightening, jerks
himself forward in the strike. His poison is sup-
posed to pay all a man’s debts in three minutes.
That’s wrong. I’ve had natives working on planta-
tions come to me after being bitten, and they’re
working still. As long as 20 minutes passed in
the last case before the “boy” reached the house.
His mates had killed the crawler, and had brought
it along for me to see. It was a death-adder all
right, and had got the boy in the calf. 1 gave him
a stiff nip of whisky, put a ligature tightly round
the leg above the knee, cut deep into the flesh
around the bite, and«rubbed in pot. permang. cry-
stals. The victim swore he was going to die, and I
swore he wasn’t. 1 told him that if he died I’d
beat him up pretty badly. He decided not to risk
the beating, and two days later was back at work
wearing a cheerful grin and a filthy bandage round
his leg—it was all the covering he l had. That
treatment I have found goes every time. Once
let a bitten person see that you think liis case is
hopeless, and you may just as well tell someone to
dig his grave. Funk kills far more than snakh-
poison.
* * # *
“Steve Hart”: Struck two swarms t’other
evening. I was, cooking my steak ’n’ onions in the
galley when out' of a slab suddenly came some mil-
lions of flying-ants. In less than a minute my tea
was ruined, and in another 30 seconds the fire was
out. I sat in the growing darkness, semi-naked,
pulling the crawlsome things off me. And then the
second swarm arrived. Fireflies! It was their first
appearance this summer. The whole gully in which
I camp (I’m a Waler) was a milky way of flicker-
ing diamonds. By their light one could easily read
small print. Never in a long bush experience have I
seen so many before. All night they flickered
in .and out my dugout, and for three nights after-
wards they turned on the gas from every crevice in
the hut. I wish I knew their life-history.
Can any Abo. name another
bird besides the pigeon that can satisfy its thirst
without raising its head from the water? With this
one exception, all the feathered tribe that I have
noticed collect a beakful, the head is raised higher
than the body and the law of gravitation does the
rest.
HE COULD ALMOST FEEL THE
STRINGS.

CORRECT LINES
The foundation of good dress, like the foundation of good art,
is an understanding of proportions and grace of line. In the
figure of every woman lie the possibilities of beauty, yet so
elusive that an ill-chosen corset may distort it to unattractiveness .

The most beautiful line
of a womans figure is
the graceful curve from
the armpit to the ankle.
The beauty of this line
determines the effective-
ness of all your clothes.
M

s
To the comfortable per >
suasion of a Gossard, the
prominent hips, the fleshy
back or too-short
waistline of maturity
give way to the graceful
proportions of youth.
A recognized authority on women’s dress has said that if you
would have an infallible guide to determine what is becoming,
you must master the correct line of the individual figure.
Study yourself; conserve the flattering lines of your figure and
subdue the inartistic details. Shun the artificial in corsetry.
The “tight waist” or the appearance of obvious corsetry is con-
spicuously unsmart; if there is a bit more indication of waistline
in some of the accepted Autumn and Winter modes, it is gained
by the skill of the dressmaker who fashions the clothes to follow
more closely the lines of the figure so the accent at the waist
becomes largely a matter of optical illusion.
As more and more women have come to a knowledge of those
things that are the fundamentals of all good dressing, the
demand for Gossard Front Lacing Corsets has grown amazingly.
There is not a type of figure, however unusual or difficult to
fit, but can be successfully corseted in these or ginal front lacing
corsets, and in them women of every type have found com-
plete expression of their ideas of becomingness and good taste.

N point of beauty, purity of tone and respon-
sive action the horizontal piano has always
been recognised as the peer of the upright. It
conforms to more mechanical laws. The world’s mas-
ter musicians, in private and public, use nothing else.
The main barrier, however, to the more universal sale
of short horizontal grands, hitherto, has been their
price. To-day that barrier does not exist. The Beale
Home Grand is an instrument possessing all the
attributes of horizontal construction. Yet it sells
for the same price asked for a high-grade upright.
The technical reasons for the superiority of horizontal pianos are
very interesting. Write for descriptive literature.

for God had sent his Maid to help the right.
Her military capacity consisted in inducing
her men to live cleanly, forswear sack, take
not the name of the Lord in vain, and to
attack the English with a new fury.
She could neither read nor write, so they
seem to have guided her hand while she
made a signature, and fashioned an impres-
sion from it which she used later. Where
her letters show cunning and literary capacity
they were probably paraphrased for her by
some clever priest; but there are a few
which are simple, innocent and childlike in
their faith in spiritual things at that fright-
ful time, and probably these wei’e written
verbatim from her dictation.
The men who surrounded her were, accord-
ing to our standards, utterly wicked, and in
contrast with them she shines forth inno-
cent and heroic; even Anatole France, who
has attempted to write her life dispassion-
ately, di'ops into pitying adjectives as he
describes her trial and execution. One
cannot resist the impression that Charles
VII., for whom she gave her life, first used
her as a kind of mascotte, and later feared
and deserted her as a witch ; hut after all
we must remember that we really know
very little about her, except that she
existed, was pure and heroic in body and
soul, and was burnt as a witch.

The Land of Blue Murder
A very interesting but unbalanced book
(the last of a seines of four) is Twenty
Years of Balkan Tangle, by M. Edith Dur-
ham. The Tangle is not a puzzle—only a
muddle. In the narrow peninsula there
are, or recently were, five States of fairly
equal tonnage —Roumania, which professes to
represent old Rome, Greece, Turkey, Serbia
and Bulgaria. The first three want, or wanted,
the whole peninsula because their ancestors
held it. The last two want great overlapping
hunks of it because their ancestors held
hunks. The claim to outlying parts of “Old
Serbia” is based on a mere 20 years’ pos-
session about 550 years ago. This is even
worse than the claim of the Hebrews of
Judah and Benjamin to all Palestine be-
cause their forebears held it in full sove-
reignty for 73 years somewhere about 2641
years ago. The Macedonians of the Penin-
sula, not a nation at present, also owned
the whole place once. No race will take
any save a murderous view of another s
claim. Then they represent many faiths, in-
eluding some extinct ones. Ihe last know n
Bogumil—a sort of sun-and-moon people-
died only the other day, and there are still
tattooed sects. They take their religion
seriously, and much disembowelment follow;.
These complications make the Balkans d;tti-
cult to rule. Australia’s John Storey
down that it is easy to govern a country it
one is honest,” but he never saw the Balkans.
The result of Miss Durham s 20 years
experience is that all Balkan Governments
are bad, the nearest one being the worst be-
cause one sees most of it. Every one
deteriorates on acquaintance. It is a land
where every moral prospect displeases and
man is easily riled. The Montenegrin in
particular, who occupies the foreground ot
the picture, isn’t a picturesque hero to Miss
Durham, though many think him one. lie
is, she says, a lazy, loafing, lying, ignorant,
murderous, insufferably conceited and bug-
infested giant. The Albanians, however,
having no government of their own, are posed
as heroes and martyrs and quite too good for
this world. Their treatment by the Greeks
and Serbs was, she thinks, infinitely worse
than that of the Belgians by the Iluns. But
the lady apparently never went to Belgium
in war-time; and, anyhow, it wasn’t in Bel-
gium but in France that the unspeakable
horrors were. She views the Austrians, and
Turks, who were rather beyond her horizon,
with considerable admiration. They are dis-
tant hills and look green. In her last chap-
ters she suffers “shame and disgust” and is
madder than a wet hen because Britain
didn’t keep out and allow the Hun to take
Belgium and the Channel ports, as its inter-
ference brought it in on the same side as Ser-
bia and Montenegro. In fact, she has
reached a point where the whole solar system
revolves round those spots, one of them one-
fifth the size of Tasmania.
The murder of Franz Ferdinand by an
Austrian subject in Austrian territory is
debited to Serbia apparently on the principle
that when a Serbian is near no crime is left
for anybody else. Still, many people set it
down to the Austrian Government itself.
Ferdinand was an unbearable nuisance. The
tragic dying or disappearing habits of the
later Hapsburgs made him heir. He was
married to a lady who wasn’t royal and
couldn’t according to starched etiquette be
empress. In the archduke’s private capacity,
if he had one, she was his wife. In his
imperial capacity she was his concubine and
not presentable, and her sons couldn’t suc-
ceed. Ferdinand was to reign as an un-
dignified grass-widower or grass-Kaiser with a
skeleton in the background. There was
always the chance that he would be willing
to burst up the ramshackle empire if he
could save a few px-ovinces where people
didn’t worry much about concubines —possibly
his wife’s country of Bohemia —as a king-
dom for his eldest son. He was better out
of the way, so the theory is that he was sent
to Bosnia with almost no protection—sent
on spec., as Edward Carson might be sent to
Galway when the excitement was highest, or
as a leaky ship that nobody wanted might be
sent round Cape Horn.
A Year’s Gleaning in Melbourne
The Australian Poetry Annual, 1920, is
a selection made by the members of the
Melbourne Literary Club from the pages of
its monthly magazine Birth. Thirty-seven
writers are represented and most of them
are well known, but the collection as a
whole is not striking. There is much good
average work, an occasional stanza that is
above the average; but there are few pieces
that could make the reader desire to rush
away to his best friends and share with
them the fine things he has discovered.
Mary Gilmore contributes this: —
O for my children,
His —and yet mine !
O ! for my children —
Wine to his wine.
I drift as a leaf in the wind of the Living,
Asking the Giver of Life for the giving.
I am the waker of life unawaked,
Water to thirst that quivers unslaked,
Calling, forever, the dust from the dust since
living began.
Give me to carry thy dust,
O man !
That appears on the first page and is very
characteristic of the author. It has force;
it sings ; but the descent .in thought from the
high trumpet note of the wine of living to
the drab business of dust-carrying is a trifle
teasing to the mind. Still the verse is
thoroughly alive and there is nothing better
to follow it; This sonnet, “The Headland,”
by R. A. Broinowski, is fairly typical of the
verse selected : —•
The spacious curve of beach finds end at last
Against the grim, grey rampart of the rock
That stands on high, immovable, to mock
The rolling onset of the ocean cast
With breaking roar and bitter tempest blast
Upon its flank. Again—the rending shock
Dies down, and round the base white waters flock
With murmuring echoes of the clamor past.
Eternal, with the sun upon its face,
Touched by the moon, or dripping with the rain,
It looks across the ever-changing plain,
And scorns majestic all the whims of space,
’Tis like the steadfast hope in stress and strain,
To which we cling, our footing to regain.
That is neither bad nor good. The thought
is a commonplace of verse-writers ; the lines
are never striking; the illegitimate couplet at
the end gathers up the obvious moral in
rather a lame way; but the sonnet, as a
whole, is not particularly noxious. “Spider
Orchids,” by Marie E. J. Pitt, is a charming
fancy that dances to good verse; L. H. Allen
sings that his “heart was set for Araby” in
lines that try to catch some note out of a
remote past and miss it by many tones;
while I\ I. O’Leary has a pieefe of preten-
tious and very bad vers lihre. Louis Lava-
ter’s “The Green World” has a thought which
is worth while ; but' the rhyming prose hurts
in stanzas, like this: —
Think of a red-souled world of robbers, then,
Of birds, beasts, fishes, beetles, worms and men,
Whose very sustenance whereby they grow
Is sack and plunder, and the green world’s woe.
A dozen lines on “A Nor’-Wester Sunset,” by
Jessie Mackay, give no hint at all of the
magic she worked in other years; and
“Yellow,” by Clarice G. Crosbie, is very
slight, though satisfying enough as far as it
goes. “The Grey Man.” by Sydney Partrige,
stands well out of the ruck and sings gaily to
its close; but Frederick T. Macartney’s
“Prayer for the Distressed Soul of a De-
parted Damsel” is neither inspired nor
mirthful. Bernard O’Dowd has An Ode to
Sydney” in which he says:—
If svelt Romance
Returning sought her myriad loves m vain
Through faithless Europe, whither would hei wit
Wheel the disquiet of her opal wain.
But to the bourn where lilac Devas flit
In looping dance
Through jacarandas to the elfin train
Who far below , „
The pink rocks strew with morning glory s blue <
Whither in trance
Long, long ago
Lured the White Doe
Oisin? And whither ArLiur did they row?
Surely to the tarn of queens
Over whom like lover leans
Sydney,
As a jonquil dreaming, Sydney!
An ode should sing; but nobody could
possibly sing that. O’Dowd is here steadfast
to all his faults throughout three pages of
verse. There is the old easy dropping of the
article before the noun, the old gathering up
of references to this, that and the other thing
which can have little real relationship to the
subject, the old use of the mystifying word,
the old spreading out of a very thin and
verse-worn thought through torrents of un-
usual and often unmusical verbiage. The
stanza quoted is by far the most attractive
in the “Ode,” but it is curiously unsatisfying.
The whole thing cries the need of thought
and work in every line. .
From pretentious emptiness ot this land
it is good to turn to the last page of the boek.'
There Elsie Cole sings—really sings—of
“First Fear” : —•
We had made a grave for the little black cat,
And Rifle’s fingers have smoothed it flat
And rimmed it with shells, but now she stands
Pondering, under the lasiandra,
And the last shells drop from her busy hands.
What is she watching? The roses wake,
Sweet wild breezes pounce and shake
Tear-shaped petals of solemnest blue
From the soft and sorrowful lasiandra
Where little round sunlights patter through.
But Elfie frowns on the roses fair,
Her dear lips tremble, her dear eyes stare,
For sudden it .seemed that a clear voice cried:
“No more Fluffy for ever and ever!”
And her face is puzzled and terrified.
What does it mean, oh, what does it mean?
The garden’s a sparkle of blossom and green
Where yesterday Fluffy was mad with play—
Then out of Somewhere Something touched him,
And Fluffy is hidden with earth to-day.
And how can the heartless world be glad?
Should a blackbird sing when a child is sad?
Oh, the mocking imps round Sorrow’s skirts
When beauty chills like a sharp black shadow!
For it is not Death, but Life, that hurts.
Run home for comfort, you poor little maid
Who have looked at Life, and felt afraid —
Grieved by the freshblown flowers that wave,
But most aghast at the cruel sunlights
That play like paws on a kitten’s grave.
Nobody would pretend that that is great
music; but in its sympathy, in its call to the
deeps within deeps, in its new setting of the
old heart problem, in its evident sincerity
and simplicity there is something of the
divine essence of poetry. The. book is re-
deemed and made worthy by its first and
last pages.

Referring to the advantages of
“Pioneer” Wood Pipe Mr.
Ludowici, Managing Director
of Mangrovite Belting, Ltd-
writes:—“We have pleasure in
stating that our 4in. pumping
main, 101 ft. x 4in. x 50ft. head,
has been in use for the past
six years, and has given splendid
service, being in daily use dis-
tributing tap liquors through
the tanyard. Our water supply,
500 ft. x 4in. x 300 ft. head pipes
carrying the city pressure,
has given no trouble, and the
difficulty and loss caused by
rust in the iron pipes formerly
in use has been entirely over-
come. We use Burrows taps
for connecting the 1 in. iron ser-
vice pipes with the wooden
pipes. In addition to the above
we have about 300 ft. of Gin. and
Sin. pipes carrying lime, sodium
and tannic-acid liquids, which,
after six years’ service, are as
good as when first laid. We are
always glad to allow our wooden
pipes to be inspected by any-
one interested.”

The Henry Jones Co., which started in
Tasmania and subsequently boiled over into
Victoria and N. S. Wales, lately bought
McEwin’s jam factory in Adelaide, and as
it was burned out later a big place is being
put up at Keswick, the suburb that started
with the military headquarters and is now
becoming an industrial centre. The new
place is to cost £60,000 and employ 600
people. It is well under way, and hopes

“Copabella”: How the gentle bureaucrat
tries to teach the international trader how
to suck egg& is told by a flour-miller who
is selling out. The Wheat Board commis-
sioned millers to mill several thousand tons,
which the Board would market as flour. It
met a trifling difficulty—that no one wanted
to buy the flour at the Board’s price.
Millers, their mills idle, then sought round
for their old pre-war private markets. This
one learned that he could put through a
deal with Chinese buyers. Application was
made for wheat with which to fulfil the
orders, but the Board said: “No, give ’em
some of the flour we’ve got stacked up wait-
ing for a buyer; nothing doing in wheat
till that’s sold!” The stacked flour is in
1501 b. bags, the Commonwealth’s own
special Chapman size, but John Chinaman
has always been accustomed to buy Aussie
flour in 491 b. calico bags, decorated with
Chinese characters. The Board, regarding
it as like their d— cheek for Chows to
want flour in any but bags of Commonwealth
approved size and texture, stands pat. So
the mill remains idle, and the chance to
recover trade passes into other hands.
* * * *
“Beef-bones”: Another effect of the mania
for sending away raw materials and dragging
something else in to take their place was
mentioned the other day by Prof. Osborne,
of Melbourne Uni. Australia is poor in
phosphates, so poor that it has to import
a lot of stuff from various remote plac.cs for
its wheatfields. Yet it is exporting phos-
phates all the time, not merely in the form
of meat and rabbits and such-like things,
but in bone —especially from Queensland.
We can't go on for ever stripping our
grass-country of phosphates. Sooner or
iater we shall pay for the folly in exhausted
land,

The Australian universities call their
official year books “calendars,” and the Postal
Department, which has never quite recovered
from Webster’s poems, insists that a calendar
is an almanac and nothing else, wherefore it
is subject to special rates. A calendar or
calender is also a machine for finishing cloth,
a list of prisoners awaiting trial and a der-
vish who is a sort of insanitary Mohammedan
monk. How much postage the hide-bound
Department would charge on a dervish is a
matter for inquiry.

■ “Lex”: The right of a casual shareholder
to inspect the works and property of the
co. whenever he takes a fancy to” do so is
being warmly discussed in England. The co.
that raised the point is English Oilfields, Ltd.,
which is boring in Norfolk. A holiday-maker
dropped in, explaining that he was a share-
holder, was refused admission, and wrote to
the papers indignantly about it. Most wen-
established works welcome, inspection, but
this one argued that “there would be danger
in promiscuous visits of a shareholder to a
mining enterprise. Pie might come away
greatly impressed or the reverse, and in
either case his deductions might be ill-
founded. Possibly his erroneous views,
expounded in all good faith, might affect the
value of the shares.” Apparently the mat-
ter has not been tested in English courts;
but in N. S. Wales W. J. Miles, by far the
largest shareholder in a meat-preserving co.,
failed to get any satisfaction when he moved
the Court to compel it to give him access
to its accounts.

“Adam Selector” (Q.) puts the case for hie
tribe:—
Yes, it’s a crime against posterity, as “E.S.S.”"
(B. 11/11/’2O) says, to destroy valuable timbers, but
the selector cannot afford to wait for posterity.
Try as he will he cannot grow grass or bananas in the
standing scrub. “But why not sell the timber?” the
city man asks. Well, I had occasion, to clear a
few acres of scrub this year, and ordered my feller
to cut everything and burn it.- He advised cutting
and selling. I listened to the voice of the tempter.
One firm took two good loads and one small load
with 16 bullocks, and up to the present time I have
been paid £3 10s. for 13 logs. For six more, so
far, I have received no money. It cost more for
the man’s labor than I have got, without counting
my own time.
This is not a solitary instance. The farmer or
selector is regarded by the milling companies as
fair game. The companies pay 18s. and £1 per
hundred to the Government for royalty, but it is
rarely that the private person. gets more than ss.
One of my neighbors could get no more than 4d.
per hundred a couple of years ago. These prices
are for pine. Is it any wonder that the nation’s
heritage is wasted?
One day next week I have to fall an ironbark-
tree that is in .the road of a few clumps of bananas.
The tree is about 18in. at the butt and 13in. 50ft.
up. If I could sell, it would bring sd. per running
foot. If that log were in a shipbuilding yard it
would be worth 10s. per foot at the least. I have
been a wheelwright, and know it is beautiful stuff
■ for naves. But sd. per foot—that is the limit!
Of course, I know that it is wicked to burn such
wood. But we don’t do such things for the fun of
it. We do it because we. couldn’t make a living
if we did anything else.

What Keeps a
Battery Young'.
To be reliable, a storage battery
must have well-made plates.
Battery solution must be proper
strength and required purity.
Battery jars must be mechanically
strong and must allow no leakage of
current or battery solution.
But it’s the insulation between
the plates that keeps that battery full
of life and adds months to its term of
useful service.
Willard Threaded Rubber Insula-
tion has made many wonderful records
in keeping batteries on the job far

NELSON ROBERTSON,

W. E. Stewart, who has been made head-
master of Yarrawonga (Vic.) State Higher
Elementary School, began as a copy boy on
Melbourne Herald. Then he tried store-
keeping, and was in early manhood before he
qualified for teaching and got a Uni. degree.
He was at Mansfield High School as acting-
chief during the war.
From loan funds, set apart for the de-
velopment of Morwell brown coal for elec-
tricity generation, it is proposed to spend
£70,000 in putting up several storeys on the
Marine Board building in Melbourne to pro-
vide offices for the Electricity Commission-
ers. But Monash may be depended upon, if
he continues in command, to see that if other
State officers occupy the building rent will
be debited. With McPherson and Monash
driving a bargain there should not be many
shavings to pick up.
While young Treatt was snapping a
Rhodes Scholarship in Sydney with £lOOO
from Ben Fuller to help him through with it,
another of the family was snapping a tiger.
It was in Java; the beast, a man-eater, had
been shot while prowling near Soebang, and
Miss Treatt had her camera ready. In-
cidentally there’s been a lion, too, in those
parts—Clemenceau, of France. But The
Bulletin’s friend who helped to entertain
him says she can only think of him as a
downy old bird.
One day recently there was a demonstration
of eurhythmies by students of a Dalcroze pro-
duct at Frensham, Mittagong (N.S.W.J, and
visitors were bidden to note what a training
this is for concentration and alertness of
mind and muscle. The idea is to “realise”
the sense of music by bodily movements.
The students beat the time of their accom-
paniment by graceful arm flexions, while
their feet beat with the values of every note.
The carriage of the body expresses crescendos,
phrasing and feeling. Eurhythmies are
always performed in loose costumes, which
give the limbs full play and publicity, and
a great sight was offered by the barefooted
lasses dancing on the sward, their whole
frame throbbing with music. Headquarters
of the cult are in Geneva; but our own
black brother did something of the kind at
a corroboree in Australia; and M. Jaques
Dalcroze, the superintendent of the Geneva
Institute, ought to see the Maoris doing a
haka.
“P.P.” : It is a familiar tragedy. Binks,
despite the increasing frigidity of Mrs. 8.,
was getting along well enough in matri-
monial harness until he found that the lady
was employing a private detective to have
him watched. She admitted having done it
for months, and declared with symptoms of
hysteria that the sleuth had found him
acting suspiciously and hoped to catch him
some day. To have told her that her sus-
picions were groundless would have been
turning good money away, and his kidney
never do that. The customary separation
followed, and Binks removed to a boarding-
house. Thither came a siren who induced
Binks, a small but obliging man, to escort
her across the neighboring park, explaining
that she was nervous. The rush of events
that followed still bewilders Binks. Pie
was suddenly confronted by the sleuth—a
discharged policeman, too massive to be
effectually assaulted —by another man, and
by Mrs. Binks, and the lady who was afraid
to cross the nark alone artistically threw
herself down and admitted horrible but
wholly imaginary things. The divorce went
through without question of the veracity of
the faked evidence. Binks paid the costs
and has secured a freedom which he didn’t
desire in exchange for a permanently black-
ened reputation. Mrs. Binks writes him
broken-hearted letters suggesting that he
should re-marry her and live a better life in
future. Meanwhile, the private-inquiry
ruffians are setting their traps for fresh
victims.
BUNNY SWANK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was a time and not so long ago
When I was reckoned ev’rywhere pestiferous;
Extermination for me high and low
Was urged; the cry was frantic and vociferous.
To wipe me off the earth then was the craze;
But now we live in 11.C.L.-ish days.
The deadly arts—poison, the trap, the gun—
All were employed to make a speedy end of me ;
Madly and ruthlessly each mother’s son
Has tried, and failed, and now they’d make a
friend of me.
Thousands who can’t afford the price of meat
Have found out I am good enough to eat.
And so it does me proud to know at last
The honest traders our good name would vindicate,
To know that through us fortunes are amassed,
And that we’re “run” by many a wealthy syndi-
cate ;
We’re the tit-bit of many a bill-of-fare,
And fetch at present two-and-nine a pair!

“The leading part in last week’s economy cam-
paign before the League of Nations was played by
Senator Millen oh Australia.”— Cable.
Fantastic instances of steel-chilled nerve
May fairly easily be conjured up;
Imaginary deeds of cheek that serve
To fill to overflowing wonder’s cup.
A creditor receiving a demand
For payment, of an overdue account
With a cold, highly-moral reprimand
And no attempt at finding the amount;
A bankrupt lecturing the assignee
On all the ills that follow in a splash,
And winding up with an impassioned plea
That all should carefully conserve their cash—
Such blatant cant would probably inspire
Emotions of astonishment in all;
In fact, one might suggest disgust and ire
As being still more likely to befall.
Yet none of them betrays such peerless hide
As Millen railing at extravagance,
With England, startled England, by his side,
And facing him the thrifty face of France !

9osts "PI Or
Fifteen
If you wish to purchase a car of the very highest class in which performance and
appearance are above criticism, then the Wolseley Post-War Fifteen is THE car
that you should decide upon.
The “Wolseley” retains all the various excellences of design which made it famous before
the war, modified and improved by the makers’ war experience in manufacturing aero
engines and fine naval mechanism.
The “Wolseley” has been very severely tested for a long period and tried out both in England and Australia under
the most difficult actual road conditions. Its power is a revelation; there is always a pleasant sense of reserve power
that is delightful to the experienced motorist. The responsiveness, flexibility and speed of the engines are such as can
only be obtained from a car of the very highest class.
The appointments are luxurious from start to finish; not a single equipment for perfect comfort and convenience of motor
travel is omitted; whilst the finish of the bodywork is the finest in the Coachbuilder’s Art.
Complete weight is under 23cwt., and taken from the stripped chassis weight of 1 6cwt. and brake-horsepower of 45h.p.,
the power-weight ratio equals 3h.p. to the cwt.
The equipment includes: Patent Canvas hood, adjustable windscreen, upholstered best leather, buttoned cushions,
Electric starting and lighting equipment (full set of lamps), spare wheel and tyre on carrier, electric horn, speedometer,
8-day clock, bulb horn, dashboard lamp, folding luggage carrier, and number-plate, with painted number at rear.

and crowd out useful plants and grasses, allowing

cultivating, harvesting, and marketing of their
crops. In short, tlaey’re Weed Farming.
Blackberries, Boxthorn, St. John’s Wort, and Rag-
wort are in undisputed possession of thousands
of acres of valuable country, mostly because their
eradication is considered impossible or
too laborious.
But, is their extermination impossible?
Not a bit of it, Mr. Landholder! Granted
you have used every conceivable means in
vain—have you ever used
"VALLO” Weed, Scrub
and Tree Killer ?
Have you heard that in all parts of
Australia “Vallo” has effectively killed
every kind of Noxious Growth to which
it has been applied—Blackberries, Box-
thorn, St. John’s Wort all included ?
“Vallo” is the easiest, handiest, and most
economical Weed, Scrub, and Tree Killer
procurable. It’s in powder form, very
soluble, and is used as a spray.

THE PALACE HOTEL,
PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA-
THE LEADING HOTEL OP PERTH,
Overlooking the Swan River.
. JOHN T. GLOWREY, Proprietor.
Australia hasn’t said good-bye to the Anglo-
Saxon race yet. At a school picnic in
Tarampa (Q.) recently the prizes were won
by such sturdy representatives of the old folk
as Meier, Dargusch, Shimke, Rasmussen,
Jendrachowski, Schroeder, Wendt, Kohler,
Marschke, Profke, Schulz, Muller, Iverkow,
Jackwitz, Lukritz, Reinhardt, Ruthenberg,
Lublte, Mememdorf, Pagel, Schealler and
Czislowski. But the local correspondent
thoughtfully adds that “Mr. F. G. Woodward
opened the Paddy’s market.”
Topping the list in naval examinations is
becoming a habit with Winn Loclcyer
Reilly, R.A.N. In England recently, he was
first among 75 candidates from the R.N. and
the R.A.N. Two years ago, in the exam, for
sub-lieut., his name likewise headed all the
rest. The young man is a native of Geelong,
and derives on the maternal side from Capt.
G. T. Potter, of the 28tli Foot, who came to
N. S. Wales with his regiment over a cen-
tury ago, and married a daughter of Major
Lockyer.
Alec Peacock’s dream of 24 years ago has
become a reality. Without reference to Par-
liament wages boards can now he created
in Victoria by the Governor-in-Council. And
the Leg. Council, which would only enact
factory legislation for two or three years
at a time up till about 15 years ago, put
the authorising bill through even more
promptly than the Assembly. In 1902, when
Irvine got his shock dissolution, all the
wages boards lapsed and had to be revived
by legislation. Peacock had charge of the
bill just passed, but it was" Lawson who
put it on the programme at last election.
The three R.C. women of Sydney upon
whom the reigning Pontiff has bestowed a
“pledge of his affection and special apprecia-
tion” are Mrs. Freehill, Mrs. John Barlow
and Isabella Sheil. Mrs. Freehill is the
widow of Frank, the solicitor, and has pots
of money, a newly-acquired house at Point
Piper and piles of art treasures, and in her
spare time is a patron of St. John’s Col-
lege, of which her late husband was a Fel-
low. Isabella Sheil is of the Tyson clan,
and the mainstay of the Altar Society of
St. Mary’s. Mrs. John Barlow needs no
introduction. In all R.C. movements she is
behind the wheel—nothing is so hopelessly
bogged in debt that Mrs. John can’t help it to
dry foundations. Her special care is the
Catholic Women’s Association. The Cross
of Pope Leo is the decoration bestowed on
these three, and it is the first time it has
reached these parts. It is a gold Maltese,
with a medallion of Leo as the centre, and
its moorings are a yellow, purple and white
ribbon.
“Gregor”: “G.C.D.” has a lot to learn
about the art of robbing pillar-boxes (B.
9/12/’2O). The method most in favor among
practitioners requires nothing more compli-
cated than a piece of string with a small
lead sinker attached, and some firm gum, or,
better still, quick-lime. The latter is
smeared on the sinker, which is dropped
in through the aperture in the box. If
a policeman isn’t handy, letters may then
be removed one by one .simply by pulling up
the string. So popular did this method
become years ago in the U.S.A. that the
authorities introduced a new kind of pillar-
box, so fashioned that when the flap was
raised and a letter inserted in the opening, a
plate of steel was interposed between the
opening and the interior of the box until
the flap was lowered again. This device
crippled letter-stealing, and the artificers
who followed it had to do something, else
for a living. Probably they emigrated fo
Australia and went into politics. Here the
industry still flourishes, and most of its pro-
fessors work in pairs, one of whom keeps
“nit” while the other operates the string
and lead.
“0.K.”: A price-fixing Commission that
commends itself to commonsense will put a
limit on the price of fish, fresh and smoked.
One thing quite certain about fishes is that
they have not reduced their hours of swim-
ming or raised their wages since the Avar.
They are indeed more plentiful than ever
owing to increased restrictions placed on
fishermen by the fish-ring agents who buy
their catches. The reward for increased sloth
on the part of the fishermen is increased
prices for such fish as the agents take off
their hands daily. The market supply is
limited to meet the ends of profiteers,
and this scandalous regulation of the blessed
law of supply and demand continues in the
face of innumerable Boards that profess to be
concerned in an endeavor to lessen the cost
of living. As for smoked fish from M.L., its
gradual rise in price from Bd. and lOd. to
2s. per lb. is not more palpably an imposi-
tion than the doubling of the price of
kippered herrings from Britain. Take the
chairman of a fair-prices Board by his ear
and lead him to a kipper in the window of
a Dago fish-shop, and ask him to suggest any
honest reason for pricing the thing at 6d.
instead of 3d. as of yore. Increased payment
to the fishermen who caught the herring?
Why, a good catch of herrings is a million
at one. haul. Increased cost of freight? For
a' herring it is an infinitesimal consideration.
The fish-seller gets 80 p.c. of the enhanced
price in extra profit. He didn’t raise the
tariff 100 p.c. all at once, but by instalments,
whilst he was feeling the public Avillingness
to stand his squeeze. His profiteering admits
of no serious denial, yet these commissions, of
one name or other, have continued for years
without in any case attempting to throw a
light on the fishy business.
THIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The debate was continued in a very thin House.’
—Daily payer.
Weakly the words are rolled about;
None fears to fail, none hopes to win,
None keeps a faith, none airs a doubt —
The talk is thin.
The game is played the old dull way;
No heart-beat stirs the wobbling chin.
The very spleen that urged the fray
Is now too thin.
God save the pride of Parliament!
Here stands the punishment of sin ;
These “represent our continent”—
The yarn’s too thin 1

Mark that Insures the Result
The Beaver Board Trade Mark, is printed on the
back of every panel we make. It is a symbol of service
—a guarantee of quality.
When you go to buy Beaver Board, this trade mark is the
first thing you should look for. It means that when you do your
panelling, you will get real Beaver Board results —rigid, crack-
proof, permanent walls and ceilings of Canadian Spruce.
Beaver Board is made from sturdy Canadian Spruce logs,
reduced to fibre, and converted into knotless, flawless panels.
You simply cut it to the required sizes, and nail it on to the studs,
or over the old papered or plastered walls.
The Patented “Sealtite” sizing process gives Beaver Board
a surface ready for instant decoration. It is non-absorbent, and
takes water colour, oil colour and distemper with excellent and
artistic results. Quality, adaptability, simplicity and “ready-ness”
—these are what the Beaver Board Trade Mark stands for.

“H.H.”: The restoration of It. D. Meagher
to the roll of solicitors by Act of the N. S.
Wales Parliament is in keeping with the
new order of things under which one Judge
was imported to camouflage the release of
certain prisoners, another appointed to find
excuse for the raising of members’ salaries,
and a third sternly warned that his job was
in danger if he wasn’t more careful to decide
as a Minister wanted. The reversing of a
judicial decision—not the alteration of any
law under which it was given, but a solitary
act as a favor to a solitary friend m the
same kind of spasmodic autocracy. I here
have been any number of solicitors struck
off the rolls, but only one of them knew how
to turn the matter into a lifelong advertise-
ment. Even the fact that he has enjoyed
prosperity since he left the legal profession
was quoted by his friends as proof that he
was a martyr of the deepest dye. One ad-
mirer calculated his sufferings at iI(X),UUU.
Joseph Carruthers grew incoherent and
said: —
I shall vote to-night to give that mercy to Mr.
Meagher which I hope to God when I am judged
will be meted out to me.
The business when put on that basis looks
less an act of justice than a fire insurance
on Joseph's soul. If R. D. Meagher is an
unfit solicitor to let loose on the community,
then letting him loose won’t help Joseph s
soul. If he is a fit man, then the matter
is one of bare justice carrying no specia
merit, and Joseph shouldn’t drag Ins soul
into it.

THE SIGN OF
PERFECTION
Bostock’s Violo Polishes, Ltd., Sydney.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
Without a superlative wardrobe or haunt-
ingly lovely ballets “Cinderella” moves
smartly at Melbourne Princess’s. The show
is strong in singing, the greatest volume com-
ing from Amy Rochelle, an Australian “boy”
of striking stature and shapeliness, who
compares more than favorably with the un-
dersized importations elsewhere. Villiers
Arnold, as King Rat, whose face expresses
the maximum of panto malevolence, also pro-
duces a cultivated voice along with Pearl
Ladd, who is compelled to remove Fairy
Snowdrop from the featherweight class.
Linda Dale, as Cinderella, has some good
notes in her soprano, and her behavior is
sweetly consistent with the allegation that
she is constantly sat on by the rest of the
family. But Cinders cannot be. congratu-
lated on her relations. Mark Erickson, as
her dad, the bad Baron, looks like some-
thing that has strayed from a safe anchor-
age in a bar-room, and his two ugly daugh-
ters (Daisy Merritt and Lola Hunt) hate
quaint ideas about decorum. Stiffy and Mo
make extensive incursions into the plot.
Stiffy "is the loud Nat Phillips, who, being
producer, never spares himself in trying to
deafen the audience. Roy Rene (Mo) is
smoother and more effective ns a Yid of
conventional type, but has just as much to
say as his voluble partner, and never lags
superfluous in the wings. However, these
people matter less, artistically, than the
youngsters in the panto. The Royal Nine
Wonders, a troupe of infant acrobats, are
truly surprising, and the dance of “The
Swan,” introduced here by Halina Sehmolz,
is cleverly interpreted by the midget Leila
Dabsoheck. Also Jack and Zenda bunny-
hug and jazz in most acceptable mimicry
of their swaying elders. Scenically the
show would make a bigger hit if Rege
Robins were equal to the creation of more
charming pictures. But his color-sense
seems defective, wherefore his conception of
a golden palace interior traduces the glint
of the noble metal.
Every day’s a matinee day at Melbourne’s
panto houses this week, and four of them are
panto houses if “Chu Chin Chow” be in-
cluded in , the hunch. The beautiful show
that sprang out of Oscar Asche’s “Kismet”
success disclaims blood relationship with the
hardy annuals of the “Aladdin” variety, but
in one of its scenes and another of its inci-
dents “Chu Chin Chow” descends to stereo-
typed foolishness. The situation of Kasim
Baba when the robbers trap him in their
cave is the same fatal catastrophe for Kasim,
in the same impossible surroundings, that
ever it was at Christmas time. The rob-
bers’ cave is an absurd storeplace for pre-
posterous hoardings. It contains enough
wealth, seemingly, to provide all the rob-
bers with handsome retiring allowances,
plus old-age pensions, yet they go on living
a comfortless, predatory life at the bidding
of an acquisitive Hasan who collects emer-
alds and diamonds by the sackful. Another
unconvincing item in these picturesque pro-
ceedings at Melbourne Tivoli is Vera
Pearce’s pretence of killing the 40 thieves
with a few teapotfuls of boiling oil. Vera
as the murderous slave-lady, is not more
satisfactory than Miss Morgiana used to be
in the old out-and-out pantos. Morgiana
never counted the jars to see there were
40 of ’em, or measured the vessels to assure
herself that they were too small to hold a
robber. Vera is just tas careless. She
looks at half-a-dozen jars large enough to
hold a small boy, pours in enough oil to
scald his feet, and then says the poor demon
of the jar is dead\ because he remains silent
instead of asking her what kind of a 40
thief she takes him for.
At Melbourne Majesty’s the deposed King
and his consort continue to cater for holi-
day-makers at the Honeymoon Hotel until
a futile Enchantress smites the obedient
establishment with .a magic ispelj, after
which the plot against the monarchy peters
out—owing to the real Humpty Dumpty
proving to be an empty egg-shell who was
fraudulently impersonated by the village
imbecile —and the balance of power is re-
stored. The eternal verities never get a
look in at Her Majesty’s panto. It is, per-
haps, rather over the odds in that respect.
The idea of a sorceress expecting to replace
a royal family from the contents of an
empty egg-shell suggests that sorceressing
couldn’t have been all it was cracked up to
he when knights were bold. The lady didn’t
know much. She must have hhd phantom
rats in her supernatural garret. She and
the silly old Gnome King, whose bursts of
blue fire never come to anything in the long
run, are only fit to help push the triumphal
car of Santa Claus. Helen Temple does
her best to be impressive in her assumption
of deadly purpose, but it’s a vain assump.
As the frugal Dame in a home-made con-
fection, Albert Le Fre is really more appal-
ling.

sents with grim

•without making
him a potentate

Colin would he a
much better hit if
he would cast off
his brilliant trap-
nings and warble
in a part more
suited to his per-
sonality. As an
amorous black-
smith, for instance, he would touch many
a flapper’s heart with a melting ballad of
love in the shade of the old forge.
“The Boy” is still going well at Mel-
bourne Royal. The high Christmas tem-
peratures somewhat affected the size of the
audiences, but it made no impression on
Arthur Stigant, who had been living in a
warm atmosphere since the show started,
and was inured to anything up to 200° in
the shade.
The Fisk Jubilee Singers, who started a
month’s season at Melbourne Athenaeum on
Christmas night, still have Professor White
at the harmonium, and Belle Gibbons con-
tinues to decorate the melodious chorus in
front. Belle rolled her eyes in a selected
solo on Saturday, and her warbling in the
conspiracy of chants ‘and medleys has not
lessened in ecstasy since this writer last saw
her. Harold Wilson is back with the sub-
terranean bass that sounds like a juvenile
earthquake at play, and Violet McAdoo is
exhuming “Daddy” to illustrate her quality
as a lady baritone. Marshall Palmer dallies
in the limelight in picturesque movie trap-
pings and supplies much .soulful ballad. Of
the newcomers Leila Wyburd brings a spaci-
ous soprano, pretty Vi Peet is the most culti-
vated artist of the crowd, and MacKenzie
and Guest, xylophonist, banjoists and
pianists, are from fair to good. Sid Haynes,
the colored tenor, is also tuneful and jolly,
but overfond of granting encores. If Sid-
ney insists on being a South-street competi-
tion at every sitting, this paper can see the
manager in the wings waving a slice of
water-melon to entice the songster off.

Another Melbourne variety show
The annual show for the Melbourne National Gal-
lery students this year includes Miss A. E. Perry’s
prize canvas for the Travelling Scholarship. It is
the usual underdone subject of a lady in a red and
white crinoline exhibiting her enormous expanse of
skirt to a mild old gentleman and a youngster in
the background. Simple and bald as the picture is,
it makes a greater splash than Miss Pye’s second
prize—four females in a studio who have evidently
learnt in advance the artist’s intentions towards them
and are lodging a protest. They suffer from bad
drawing and have a grievance in the color scheme.
The other color sections are not a great advertise-
ment for the school. The artist who captured the
trophy for best-painted head won by a whisker from
an indifferent field. The same might be said of B.
Wallace, who gets home for a Sargentesque portrait
of an enamelled saucepan, two or three onions and
a bottle. But there is more promising stuff amongst
the charcoal workers. E. Buckmaster is the hero in
this department for the best head and nude from
life and also study of antique drapery. The - back-
view of a well-built man is excellent in its model-
ling. The old anatomical figure, which is one of the
first hurdles in a conservative art training, brings A.
Colem’s name to the fore, and M. Haysom has
another antique which in the opinion of the referees
wins easily on points. J. I. Moodie gets the verdict
for the antique head, but some of the other studies
are so close that the judges were probably kept in a
state of suspended consideration for a while.
* * *
“Baby Bunting,” which arrived at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday night, is bound to'
succeed this hot weather. The plot calls
for no strenuous mental effort. The music
arouses no violent emotions. The show has
the restful charm of some well-remembered
landscape in a peaceful and rather flat part
of the country. Dorothy Brunton is about
two-thirds of the performance, so far as
allurement and finished art go, but her so-
journ in London has robbed her personality
of a certain riotousness which made a tre-
mendous local appeal. Her acting has im-
proved out of sight: her voice seems to have
weakened. Madge Elliott and Cyril Bitchard
do the usual dance with their customary
grace, and Alfred Frith and Field Fisher get
every ounce' of effect out of the comic stuff,
and a bit over. William Greene,.Cecil Brad-
ley, Jack Hooker —these and many other
established favorites perform admirably; and
the dressing is amazing—amazing in its
clamant expensiveness, and amazing also,
occasionally, in its beauty.
** * *
“Three Wise Fools” continues its run at
Sydney Palace Theatre, which is almost too
small for the multitudes desirous of witness-
ing the lovable asininitv of J. D. O’Hara and
his two old friends and the romantic conduct
of Lizette Parkes and her youthful lover.
Nevertheless, it will give way to “Welcome,
Stranger,” with the same co. as interpreters,
on Saturday next.

Anita Stewart double-banks herself on
Sydney Crystal Palace and Strand sheets
in a tidal wive of intrigue and mystery
called “The Yellow Typhoon.” Anita is
her own good and bad sister. As the good
girl of the family she becomes a secret-service
agent who helps to blow international plots
sky-high; as her own blonde adventuress
sister she becomes a spy and a courtesan in
a large way of business —like the League of
Nations, all things to all men. Robinson
Crusoe and Man Friday have discovered their
desert island at the Lyceum. Same address
finds Mabel Normand running away from
her circus home. Her alibi this time is
Jinx. May Allison as a girl artist in ravish-
ing overalls asks the question “Are All Men
Alike?” Her problem is oaus/ed mainly
by a pair of kissable lips. At the Strand
“The House of a Thousand Candles,” which
is an evergreen delight of flapperdom, has
grown up and developed into a movie under
the title of “Haunting Shadows.” But the
old house with the banging doors and the
shuddering lights, the noises at the back of
the family portraits, the nefarious lawyer,
the only-pretending-dead uncle and the pro-
digal nephew and the sweet little school
inarm give you all the old thrills over again.
Globe and the Haymarlcet shelter a get-rich-
nuick young man called Homer, and Enid
Bennett anchors her husband’s affections by
a brace of “Hairpins.”
From the N. S. Wales Gallery:—•
Parliament, which, as Dicey once remarked, can
“do anything but make a man a woman or a
woman a man,” has restored R. D. Meagher to
the roll of N. S. Wales solicitors in the teeth of
the Courts’ opposition. The hostility of the legal
profession to Meagher had little to do latterly with
his original lapse, grave though it was. Meagher
wasn’t “respectable.” He smoked cigars at the
wrong angle, and wore his hat over his right eye, and
frequented prize-fights, and every now and then came
out with a bitter attack on someone who did none
of these things, thus indicating an unrepentant and
demagoguish spirit. Also there were dark rumors
and furtive murmurings concerning his methods of
finance; but these, after all, are liable to befall any
man. The life of one of Sydney’s most prosperous
retailers was for about 20 years made 'Unpleasant
by baseless stories of the impending bankruptcy of
his business. One of the most sensible remarks made
during the extraordinarily inept debate in the Legis-
lative Council came from wise old Jimmy McGowen.
“If Mr. Meagher were reinstated,” he said, “the
public would know all about him that could ever be
known. They would have to pay to find out as
much about other solicitors.” That is so. There
are more dangerous men on the rolls than Crick’s old
partner; but even if it weren’t so any Judge, jury
or client who is deceived by Richard Dennis after
the 30 years of warnings that have been issued
against him by press, Parliament and the Bench is
incorrigible in credulity.

“Ritt Streeter”: I ran across a cheery
mummer yesterday. “Things pretty good in
.your line,” I couldn’t help remarking; “I see
the Federation has been putting in a deal of
time in the Arbitration Court making life
easier for you.’ lie smiled. “Dunno,” said
he. “From what I can make ouf we still
have to rehearse for nothing, living on air
meanwhile; we still have to pay for sleepers
when we’re travelling (they’re 17s. 6d. nowa-
days) ; we still have to lose time and salary
when the manager wills. Not that it affects
me much,” he concluded; “I«haven’t had a
job for six months.” A well-known man,
too.
“Hamfat”: Most of the decayed persons
who used to act as supers when the rate
was two and six a performance have been
pushed out by an invasion of smartly-dressed
young-men-about-town, hut a few of the old
school still hang on. One of them confided
to me that bis long experience keeps him
in a “shop,” although his appearance at the
stage-door ought to, be enough to put the
“Three Wise Fools,"
at Sydney Criterion.

blight on an y
show. Over a
pint (for which I
paid) he declared
that there hadn’t
been a production
in Sydney worth
talking about since
McKee Rankin and
Nance O’Neil
staged “Macbeth.”
Remembering the
performance, I re-
marked that the
banquet scene was
good. “Good?
Good? My Gad,
sir!” he thundered,
“the best staging
ever seen 'in Syd-
ney ! Why, sir, all
the meats on the
table were real —
solid, juicy joints
with vegetables
and gravy. All
genuine, sir, right
down to the mus-
tard, and every
night after the
performance w e
actor-rs shared the
banquet behind the scenes.” I left the old chap
hoping that the wheel of time would bring
back a management that should once more
stage a dinkum feed, in the interests of
verisimilitude and hungry supers.
“Nero”: Notwithstanding the much-
boomed Actors’ Federation, or perhaps be-
cause of it, the dramatic side of the theatrical
profession in Australia has never known a
worse season than the present. Dozens of
well-known, capable actors and actresses who
unfortunately cannot sing or dance are “rest-
ing.” With the exception of Fuller’s stock
co. there is only a single theatre in Mel-
bourne or Sydney housing a dramatic show,
and the co. playing there consists of imported
American artists to the extent of quite one-
half. Nor are tho prospects of the indigenous
actor any more favorable in the immediate
future. No big dramatic productions are
foreshadowed. Joseph Coyne is coming to
play a few farcical comedies, but he will pro-
bably bring most of his company with him,
and what he doesn’t bring will be provided for
by the inclusion of “left overs” from recently
imported companies. The Big Combine
claims that there are no dramatic plays
written nowadays that could be pro-
duced in Australia with any chance
of success. What of “The Great Lover,”
“The Right to Strike,” and “The Garden of
Allah” ? The last of these has been
packing Drury Lane for months, and has
actually ousted the annual pantomime. It is
undeniable that the movies have to some ex-
tent captured the lovers of dramatic fare, but
the success of the Fullers’ stock companies
proves conclusively that there is still a con-
siderable audience for the “spoken” drama.
What is wanted is a new theatrical firm with
capital enough to build a few modern theatres
and sufficient enterprise to produce plays
which do not depend solely on catchy airs,
extravagant dressing and more or less shapely
limbs.
“Rienzi” : The originality of these panto-
producers makes one gasp. This year the
Firm repeats for the manyth time the frayed
idea of damsels appearing in tiers in a black
background. Also Maggie Dickenson and
Sid Yates repeat old dance forms, she going
through the usual evolutions as the fright-
ened butterfly destined to be the victim of
the cru e 1 grass-
hopper. Elsie
Parkes at the
King’s has almost
the same experi-
ence as a moth
leapt upon by a
youth represent-
ing a candle-flame.
In minor matters
the two shows
have apparently
had the same brain
waves. Both
pantos appeal to
the audience t o
join in a ichorus
song. B o t h
dames try for
laughs with comic
knitting, and both
of them mention
dear old Foots-
cray. This last
innovation must be
due to the Tait-
Williamson amal-
gamation. When
J.C.W. and the
Taits were com-
mercial enemies,

out the old laugh-getter for 'fear of being
charged with plagiarism.

abandonment of young parts by old mummers
it would have sounded quite reasonable. But
they surely wouldn’t deny a woman of over
live dozen and five, and a man of more than
70, the right to play characters as old as their
years? An old dog for an aged part every
time. Look at Joseph Graham, of the “Man
from Toronto” co. With his reminiscences of
Hoskins, and ITis elderly manner, Graham
must be somewhere adjacent to 70, but no-
body would suggest that he breathes an age of
compulsory retirement from the elderly part
of'Leila’s long-suffering guardian. His peculiar
fitness for it is in his unaffected manner of
presenting his natural self. Look at Mrs. G.
B. W. Lewis, or Rose Edouin, as she re-
called herself after returning to the England
of her young days. She has given some fine
representations of old women on the stage
since she was 65. A portion of the strength
of the original Brougli-Boucicault co. lay in
the fact that Brough’s elderly mother —Miss
Romer—played the principal old-woman parts
without being required to look older than she
was.
“Dido”: I feel the keenest sympathy
for the choruses in the average Australian
pantomime or musical play of any sort,
noting how hard they work and how well
their work is done and how greedily the lead-
ing ladies mop up all the applause. An
imported dame, with an indifferent voice,
which she produces wretchedly, trips out and
sings some song, good, bad or paltry, and
sings it with the air of a mistress of the
lyric, hurling a lot of mock abandon in at
intervals. Then troops in a smartly-dressed,
handsome gang with excellent voices, sing-
ing the chorus with real gusto and in a
musical and workwomanlike way. and the
house is suddenly gladdened and bursts into
a storm of applause. It wants it over again,
and once more; and every time the solo
singer lingers behind and scoops up all the
glory, bowing, prancing and smirking. Never
is the chorus that is really responsible for
the general delight allowed to back in and
bow, and grin, and throw kisses at the gal-
.lery. On one occasion I did hear a gallery
voice advise it, referring to the flat soloist:
"Oh, pitch ’er into the orchestra, and do
it yourselves!” and once more I was on the
side of the gods.
"Royce Rolls”: The songs and music of
“Sinbad the Sailor” at Melbourne King’s
suggest that Australia, musically speaking, is
becoming a suburb of Noo Yoik. The ditties
make allusions to Manhattan, Tiffany’s and
Noo Yoik’s foreign population, and there are
even a couple of items in which dear old
Wyoming is mentioned. Most of these num-
bers are drivel, so the management’s im-
portation of the stuff is not so annoying as
it seems. It is clearly an intimation that
the rubbish is not obtainable from Australian
writers.
“C. Ockney” : The original head-gaoler and
assistant-tonnenter in "The Yeomen of the
Guard” was the late W. H. Denny, who
gave Australian audiences a taste of his
quality as a comedian in 1903 in the George
Musgrove Shakspearean productions. It was
Denny’s first part at the Savoy, Gilbert
figuring him as the ideal Shadbolt after see-
ing bis performance of the bucolic constable
in Pinero’s "Dandy Dick,” of which part he
was alsp the original exponent.
“Hannibal”: "On Our Selection” was
screened in our N.S.W. North Coast town-
ship at the same time as "On with the
Dance.” Dad and Mum drew a packed
house,' but there was a large expanse of
vacant timber at the American show. And
the roars that issued from the hall in which
the Rudd comedy was being unfolded showed
that Bill and Annie recognised the types as
true to life. City critics should acquii'e some
knowledge of wayback Australia before tak-
ing Steele Rudd to task because his bush-life
hasn’t the city’s do-dah culture. After all,
the people of small country towns are best
qualified to judge the essential truth of the
Queenslander’s stoties.
“Orb” : The daybiljs advertising the present
G. and S. revivals announce “Trial by
Jury”; but that cheerful outbreak is not
likely to occur during the present Sydney
season. It was advertised in Melbourne, but
never happened. Now that we have to pay fan-
tastic prices to see the show, the management
might tack “Trial by Jury” on to the brief
“Pinafore,” at least, as was done in the
cheap old days. The Firm used to give us
an "extra” with other operas sometimes. I
remember May Pollard, Elsie Cameron,
Lissant, Rosevear and Billy Elton doing a
“musical proverb” by Arthur Cellier,
“Charity Begins at Home,” as an afterpiece
to “lolanthe.”
“Film Up” : Don’t agree at all with “R. 8.”
(B. 23/12/’2O) that “the newest English
films are as bad as the earlier pictures.”
I saw an excellent British-made racing pic-
ture the other night—an adaptation of one
of Nat Gould’s yarns. Though the photo-
graphy was not up to the best American
standard, the acting and the details of the
race were far superior to anything I’ve seen
from Yankeeland. “R. 8.” sneers at English
sentimentality as being “merely mush.”
This strikes me as merely amusing. The
U.S. story-writers, as a rule, out-mush the
mushiest, and there is/evidence that audi-
ences are getting a bit tired of the treacle.
The stage effects of Chung Ling Soo, the
Scotch Chinaman, well remembered as a
Rickards turn in Australia, were sold by
auction the" other day in London. They com-
prised some curious “lots” —“disappearing
and other fakes,” “a vanishing bench girl in
wood case,” and “a Pretty Polly illusion.”
But the oddest assortment put up included
“papier-mache life-sized lions and elephants,
the Holy Bible printed in Chinese, four
volumes of an English-Cliinese dictionary and
a death-chair illusion.” There is no doubt
that the late Chung was the complete con-
jurer.
“J.W.”: The Three Wise Fools preen
themseltes on being called Athos, Porthos and
Aramis. But they are not real enthusiasts
for the immortal work of Papa Dumas. Had
they been so they would surely have made it
their business to attend a performance of
Henry Hamilton’s play when it was presented
in little old N’Yark.. Then they would have
tumbled to the fact that there is no earthly
need to drag in "The Soldiers’ Chorus” from
Gounod’s “Faust” for the use of the Three
Musketeers. "In banquet or battle in tavern
or tent, W’hether feasting or fighting or love
be your bent, There’s none that can equal
or even come near Y’our roystering devil-may-' 1
care Musketeer —Your King’s Musketeer.”
That is the slogan of the Three Musketeers,
and it is set to a version of “A Little Bit of
String” raised to the power of the heroic,
musically speaking. The tune is as catchy
as “The Marseillaise” and would ensure a
hearty round at the exit, if such be the actor’s
desire. “The Soldiers’ Chorus” is quite out
of place.
“A.D.D.”: If the revival of the Gilbert.and
Sullivan operas can resurrect some of the old
Savoy traditions much good will result,
especially in amateur circles. One of the
best accepted of these was “Punctuality is
no virtue.” It was regarded merely as a
simple necessity of polite society. In many
amateur bodies of to-day where no system of
fines operates it is almost impossible to secure
this quality, but in the Savoy hey-day casual
lateness was treated as a personal insult.
“Silas Snell”: There was a giant known
as Great Scott showing in connection
with a Wonderland in Melbourne. Lie was
a tremendous Caledonian, with a brogue
like pairrrritch and a foot like an outsize
in coffins. He greatly diminished his value
as an exclusive spectacle, however, by seek-
ing cheap publicity in pubs, his fondness
for the spirit of his fathers being his down-
fall, so that eventually brither Scots had
“The Lilac Domino,"
at Sydney Tivoli.

to club their baw-
bees to send him
home. One night,
shortly after he
reached these
shore's, he was en-
tertained at the
residence of a
Scot named
McDougal, a man
o f considerable
means. When he
left after midnight
he was almost and
the brithers were
quite fu’. Next
morning McDougal
called on the giant
at his lodgings,
an d found him
a-bed. “Rufus,”
said McDougal,
“y o u carried o ft'

hoose oot o’ ma
gairden last night.”
“Ah deed na seech
thing,” replied the
giant. “My, but
ye deed, mo n.
There it lies in
yer ain gairden the
noo.” The giant
looked out of the
window. True
enough there lay a
quaint structure
something like a huge long-stemmed mush-
room with shreds of creeper all over it.
“Mu conscien6e!” gasped Great Scott, “and
what the deil did I do wi’ my own umbrel’?”
“Norbell”: Lester Carey, the Australian,
was once on the same bill as Caruso. He
says that the “going on” of the potentate
was as ceremonious as the launching of a
man-o’war. First the s.-m. and assistants
shooed any profane trespassers from the
wings; then when the “all clear” was given
the High C. was escorted to the entrance,
while a couple of dressers hovered in "he
rear, and a fireman stood at attention. One
dresser handed a cigarette, whilst the other
held a light and the ash-tray. Caruso had
a couple of draws, then dropped his fag on
the tray, and the fireman saw that it was
properly extinguished. But soon all this
pomp and pose was forgotten in the glory
of the incomparable voice.
“75” (London) ; Many managers and
lessees of West-end theatres are abolishing
the gallery from their houses. The gallery
no longer exists at the Little, London Pavi-
lion, Criterion, Playhouse and St. Martin’s.
Some of the managements still retain the
gallery but have altered the price. Right
through the war and afterward the “bob”
gallery (plus tax) was retained, but Is. 6d.
or 2s. (plus tax) is now required to gain a
seat in the cheapest part of Daly’s, the Gar-
rick, the New, the Palace, the Empire and
the Hippodrome. The new prices are caus-
ing many old-time “gods” to stay away,
which is a pity, for, generally speaking, a
London gallery crowd is the best-informed
part of the ho_use.
TO AN OLD-TIMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw you sitting in time place
Where once to hear you people ran,
And cheered at sight of your dear face.
This night unknown to any man
You sat and watched the players through,
And I silt near by, watching you.
Your cheek was pale, the glow was gone
That once upon the merry scene
Like sweetest Spring-time sunlight shone.
You took small joy of this, I ween.
No interest stirred you, and no smile
(Played lightly on your lip the while.
The crowd about you nothing knew
Of those bright nights when, like a fay,
Through some gay operetta flew
A creature debonair and gay,
Whose sweet voice ever will for me
Ring down the groves, of memory.
For you were sweet and very fair,
The dancing soul of merriment;
And though to people gathered there
You nothing were, this continent
Holds thousands still to whom in truth
You live, a thing of joy and youth.
1 watched until the play was done.
A tear slid down my cheek, I vow,
For here was not the old-time fun,
And weariness was on your brow.
Then drifting forth it seemed to me
I’d seen you play your tragedy.

Cohn joined the party at the play,
Six Hebrews, in a row.
Good Mrs. Cohn and Moses they
Were next to Joseph’s Flo,
And Rachel Moss, and Sapt, her friend,
Were seated at the other- end.
The play was very bad indeed;
The gallery hissed in scorn;
■ co. was poor, the wretched screed
Of truth and wit was shorn.
Said Moses: “Neffer in my days
Haf I sit oud so bad a plays.”
The people in the other rows
They guyed it openly,
And from the pit derisive crows
Assailed each scene. With glee
The young men eased the awful ijk
By asking actors to get work.
Sighed Mrs. Cohn: “I do atmit
Eet vos der wretchet blay.”
“Don’d say doze things,” said Cohn, “for it
Aindt ve our money pay ?”
“Hear, hear ! Hear, hear, my friend !” cried Sapt.
And six fat Hebrews sat and clapped.

Pleasurable Motoring
does not depend on covering as many miles in an hour
as possible, or of getting from town to town in the
shortest possible time. The permanent charm of
motoring is the ability to get away out into the open—
away from the rush and bustle of modem life—in fact
a new. world awaits the motorist who knows how to
really enjoy the benefits conferred by the motor. Leave
the wild rush across country to the “ younger bloods,”
let your pace be set by road conditions, and don’t aim
at covering long stages. We depict one of the many
pleasant associations of the car—a run along the water
front, a sojourn for afternoon tea followed by-a pleasant
chat, then home in the cool of the evening* This
is motoring at its best. Certain essentials necessary,
viz., a reliable car, and strong, sturdy, dependable tyres.
As to the latter; you will find Australian “Railroad”
DUNLOP
TYR
meet all requirements, giving thousands of miles of free-
of-trouble travel at a lower running cost than any im-
ported tyre. “Dunlops” don’t chip or cut, are particu-
larly free of casing troubles—in fact no other cover or
tube gives you the satisfactory service that you can
always depend upon getting from the “Railroad’’-the
most popular tyre in Australia to-day. All garages
can supply in “beaded edge” or “straight sided’’types.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
Dr. Claude J. Tozer, who had a tragic
death near Sydney last week, on the top rung
of Australian batsmen; but ill-luck pursued him.
Though he got a place with Macartney’s XI in the
trial match, he was omitted from the N.S.W. v.
England fixture, but the Board of Control lifted him
into the Australian XI v. England match at Bris-
bane. There was no room for him in the southern
tour, but the N.S.W. selection committee solaced him
with the captaincy of the N.S.W. XI v. Queens-
land on Saturday. Last year Tozer’s best effort was
against Queensland at Brisbane (51 and 103), and
in Sheffield Shield matches he averaged 25.50 for
two innings. With University in Sydney premier-
ship he topped the season’s aggregates in 1910-11
(794, averaging 72.18) and 1913-14 (842, averaging
76.55).
* * * *
In the Sheffield Shield match Victoria did
well to get N. S. Wales out for 366 on a perfect
wicket. Ransford was mainly responsible. He had
to stand down, and his substitute, Ironmonger, got
4 wickets for 127. Bardsley made a practically
chanceless 125. Macartney again fell in trying to
■•divert a straight length ball. Gregory laid the wood
on to the tune of 46 (n. 0.). He i% put in rather
late for a batsman of his calibre, and the practice
further means that if he gets a score he has to
begin bowling right on top of it. The Vic. bowlers,
as usual, suffered from dropped catches, the prevail-
ing epidemic in their club cricket. Their opening
batsmen were beaten by Gregory’s pace. Mayne,
Lampard and Baring all made brief stays. Park
and Armstrong stopped the rot, although Mailey had
both tied up frequently. Park eventually reached
his century, the ball beating the fieldsmen seven
times. Time was when no star player would have
dreamt of keeping his bowling hand out of the way
of a fast ’un, as Kelleway did, in the case of one of
Armstrong’s shots. The fashion seems to have been set
by the Englishman Parkin. However most ' of our
men, and notably the best of the bowlers such as
Mailey, still have a go at anything.
* * *
“0.K.”: From the day when one of the
Victorian boys scored 100 off the bowling of Parkin,
Woolley, Douglas and all the other bowliiig strength
of the Englishmen save Hitch and Waddington, I
couldn’t give the visitors a chance of ever getting a
Test team out cheaply in both innings. Parkin
apparently was their main hope, and his trundling
tricks were comparatively crude and simple. All
that the Victorian team needed was, confidence to
treat the English bowling as commonplace stuff.
Douglas’s meq were the feeblest team from England
that I could call to mind, though I remembered be-
ing profoundly unimpressed by an eleven that in-
cluded the futile W'aimvright among its crack
bowlers. Seems to me that after a long pause be-
tween Australia v. England struggles the Australians
will always have much the best of it. Conditions in
this country are favorable to the development of
tricky bowling and patient batting talent, whereas
the English wickets mostly play into the bowler’s
hands and encourage batsmen, cramped or free, to
play a comparatively slovenly game. But the Eng-
glishmen derive a more powerful tonic from a Test
match series than the Australians get. They are
sharply reminded of their shortcomings. So, while
the Australian team mat goes to England next year
will be all the better for passing from summer to
summer, it will not have as soft a job as the Aus-
tralian team has now. England will have learned
something from her young rival. For one thing she
will have been-reminded of me absurdity oi putting
Test-match trust in bowlers who, without being won-
ders with the ball, are duffers with the bat.
* * * *
“Orb”; The Sydney cricket serangs, who
snorted about their tender consideration for the
public in connection with their shabby treatment of
the South Aus. team, might have shown their regard
for the comfort of the record crowd at the Test by
providing a band on at least one day of the match.
No one particularly wants to see Gregory bowl to
the strains of “Abe, My Boy,” but the savage bar-
rackers who had to stand patiently in the sun
during the many intervals might have been soothed
by a little music.
* * * *
Pat liendren is England’s best run-getter
in Australia. In the nine matches he hasn’t missed
double figures, and has an aggregate of 746, averaging
74.6. In the Test Hendren hung out with extraor-
dinaiy patience for 28 and 56; but the effort was
so ungainly and unlike his style that it was painful.
He who was once a dashing stylist is now a crouching
batsman.
“Point”: The improved confidence of the
Australians, as well as of the Englishmen, when they
came to bat a second time, shows again that the
quality of a side’s bowling is largely a matter of
how the other side regards it. I remember tlwt
famous fifth Test match which was won for England
by a little Yorkshireman named Brown when it
seemed probable that we should do the trick with
100 runs to spare. Everybody, including Stoddart,
played a cramped, nervous game till Brown came in.
He started to hit fours, and in less than an hour
had reduced our bowlers to despair. Afterwards he
said that anyone could have won that match. The
bowling was no good, he insisted: the only credit
he deserved was for perceiving at once the oppor-
tunity for any competent batsman to bang the ball
about without any nervous misgivings as to what
would happen if he made a bad stroke.
Johnny M. Taylor (N.S.W.), who had a
brilliant batting “double” of 34 and 51 in the first
Test, is a thick-set Aussie of 25. He played for
N.S.W. in Sheffield Shield cricket in 1914-15 and
averaged 24.50. Next season he was in top form
in Sydney premiership cricket, and piled up 857
runs, averaging 45.10. Warren Bardsley alone beat
him with 868 for that season. With the A.I.F.
XI Taylor scored 1748 runs in England, his cen-
turies being 104 v. Oxford, 138 v. Forbes’ XI,
146 v. Sussex. In all matches this year he has
scored 435, averaging 62.14. In his schooldays
he played with Newington (Sydney), and was the
most brilliant batsman in G.P.S. cricket in his years.
Jack Hobbs was England’s best batsman
in the first Test, and the only batsman who felt easy
at both the wiles of Mailey and the whizbangs of
Gregory. His 49 and 59 were the best aggregate
on England’s behalf. In the first innings he was
out to the foolishness of attempting to pull a
straight ball from Gregory; in the second, Arm-
strong tricked him l.b.w. with a “straight break,”
and a wry face told of the chagrin he felt at being
so easily outed. In all matches of the tour Hobbs
has piled up 595 runs, averaging 59.5.
Warwick Armstrong’s brilliant 158 v. Eng-
land is his best effort in a Test match. He was
at the wickets 34 hours, and hit 17 fourers; but
some of the boundary hits were allowed by fields-
men who wouldn’t risk stopping the cannon-shots.
His aggregate of 1726 for 52 completed Test innings
averages 33.19. Armstrong’s other Test century
was 133 not out A Melbourne ip 1908. In first-
class cricket this year he has scored 625 runs,
averaging 156.25; and despite the millstone of 41
years and nearly 19 stone, Armstrong is still one
of Australia’s best.
* * * *
The Englishmen began a two-days’ match
against a Bendigo XV on Boxing Day. Losing the
toss they batted on a soft wicket. Hobbs delighted
the citizens with a free and open innings of 52.
Makepeace got six more, but was not nearly so
attractive. Douglas, as the pitch improved, settled
down to some sparkling cricket. Parkin was the
only other to do much. He was also on the spot
with the ball, and completely deceived the goldfields
talent by his change of pace.
H. L. Collins’s “double” of 70 and 104 in
his first Test v. England puts another Australian
record in the book. Collins is a great find, because,
among other things, he is proving an excellent opening
batsman —and he came when Australia wanted such
a one badly. Collins has been the most successful
batsman v. England this season, since he piled up
18 and 106 at Brisbane and has an aggregate of 298,
averaging 74.5. He is captain of the N.S.W. XI v.
Victoria, and a brilliant field.
Sydney Grammar had two fine wins in the
inter-State G.P.S. matches at Melbourne. St.
Peter’s (Adelaide) was downed by 386 to 201, of
which a brilliant 130 by A. Smith was the biggest
lump towards Sydney’s total. Against Melbourne
Grammar the Sydney youths had the good luck
of first use of the wicket, and piled up 309—Pratten
(captain) scoring 115 and Gay 70. The rain
spoiled the pitch for the Melbourne Grammars, and
they crashed for 106 and 100. The star bowling
efforts were lan Wood’s (Melb.), six for 97, and J.
Pratten’s (Sydney) five for 24.
Backers usually come a cropper over the
A.J.C. Summer Cup. They did it again on Monday.
After winning a week previously over a mile and a
quarter the Tartan gelding Booster was backed
down to 3 to 1. Then a coterie of big bettors
wheeled up solid wads for Millieme, and at the close
Booster had lengthened to 4’s and Millieme short-
ened to 7 to 2, with the ancient Lingle at 7’s and
Braille at B’s. Neither Millieme nor Booster looked
like a winner at any stage of the race. Four fur-
longs from home it was clear that the Prudent King
gelding Braille, taken up recently by Tom Scully
after a long spell, had the race at his mercy. He
was travelling along freely in front and showing
anxiety to make the going faster. At the turn the
youngster on top let go his head, and drawing away
he ran in an easy winner three or four lengths ahead
of his stable-mate Arch Marella. Millieme staggered
home a couple of lengthy further back, pursued
wearily by Finmark and Booster, who bore the
appearance of a pair of rocking horses. Booster got
badly placed over the first part of the journey and
when asked to move up hadn’t half the stamina
required. The performance strengthened his reputa-
tion as a nag with one good race and half a dozen
bad ones in him per season. Braille, who is owned
by a couple of small punters, had already won over
13 furlongs at Randwick. He was reckoned to have
a first-class chance of taking the Metrop. before
last, but became indisposed before the day and
was turned out.
* * * *
Racing prizes, as well as prices, are going
up. Stakes at Caulfield on Boxing Day and Fleming-
ton on New Year’s Day are now getting to be quite
considerable. The ancient Caulfield fixture is worth
3150 for six events, whilst half a dozen V.R.C.
races on New Year’s Day will average £660. The
Standish and Bagot Handicaps, one time a popular
double, are worth £lOOO apiece this year.
* * * *
Of all the cross-country jockeys in Vic-
toria J. N. McGregor has had the worst luck in bump-
ing against obstacles and the best luck in not getting
killed. He met his latest mishap when schooling a
novice over hurdles at Mentone. He was almost
unconscious when picked up, but long acquaintance
with stunning falls has made him an almost impos-
sible subject for any sort of complete insensibility
save death. And nobody supposes that an accident
to J. N. McGregor is capable of being fatal.
The Great Northern Foal Stakes (for
two-year-olds, 6 fur.), on the first day of the Auck-
land (M.L.) Summer Meeting on Boxing Day, went
to Mermin, winner of the Wellesley Stakes at Welling-
ton, by a neck from The Hawk, in lmin. 13 4-ssec.
That is good going for youngsters, who, however,
usually race up a straight six furlongs in the
Ricketty Isles. In the Auckland Gup (2 miles), at
the same meeting, Starland prevailed by a neck
over First Salute, with the Demosthenes colt Gasbag
third. On the same day, at Palmerston North, Client
won the Manawatu Cup, giving the Martian mare
Esperance 311 b. and Moutoa Ivanova (by the same

THE'RULING PASSION.
THE ENTHUSIAST : “I hear you. were play-
ing out on the links yesterday. What
did you go in?”
THE FLAPPER : " My new gabardine frock —
it's a dream.”
The Bananaland Turf Club started a
meeting at Eagle Farm on Monday, and the prin-
cipal race, the Newmarket Handicap (lj) mile),
Was somewhat of a procession. Three " lengths
separated Parmsdec from the favorite Galas, who
was the same distance in front of Bobby Boy. A
brother of the brilliant Molly’s Robe, Lord Syce,
won the Flying, and in the Welter Glenbern turned
the tables on Woodripe, the Sunripe horse and the
winner running away from the field.
* * * *
There is no Eurythmic among the West-
ralian three-year-olds this year, and the W.A.T.C.
Derby was annexed by the third-rate Sydney per-
former Fluent (Flippant—Starland) from ithe locally-
bred Jolly Cosy (Jolly Beggar—Tea Cosy) and
Mountain Heath (Green Mountain—-Red Heath).
Fluent went out at 16’s, and won by a length and
a half. Rupert Clark’s Skysail (The Welkin —Cape
Hatteras) was an even-money favorite but failed
ingloriously. Bobaris (5 to 4 on) landed the w.f.a.
Perth Stakes from Bardus and Sam Mackay’s Out-
look, but only headed the Kalgoorlie Cup-winner
in the last stride, and the latter will start at short
odds in the Perth Cup, which is to be run on
Saturday unless the threatened railway strike causes
a postponement. But Bardus will have his work
cut out to beat Lustroso, a fine-looking English
horse by the 1911 Derbv-winner Sunstar. Lustroso
has shown fine staying ability, but . is a difficult horse
to ride.
* * » *
On the second day of the Port Adelaide
races the Pistol horse Paratoo followed up his Lans-
downe Stakes by getting home in front of Seamada
in the Port Adelaide Cup, with Crusader again
filling third place. The winner’s chance was con-
sidered second to none, and he ran away from the
second horse at the end. Crusader was at the head
of the rest, a bad third; the heavy going spoilt
Dependence and King Bier’s chances, and Lord Setay
was not asked to do an impossible task. In spite
of the soft track the Commemoration Handicap for
two-year-olds (5f.) was won in the good time of
lmin. 3sec. by Alocosia, a daughter of Pandanus.
* * * *
Three months ago when Sid Godfrey,
thin-lipped and palefaced, saluted a Sj'dney Stadium
crowd, there was hardly a cheer of welcome. On
Saturday night he got a greeting that the shade
of Les Darcy might have envied. When he got to
work on Arthur Wyns the impression was strength-
ened that in this spare, impassive lad Australia has
one of the most remarkable feathers in the world.
He beat the Belgian champion for round after round,
on points, always keeping that wicked right of his
poised for the finishing stroke if opportunity should
offer. In the ninth round it did. Wyns. momen-
tarily forgot the ever-present danger, and uncovered
the near side of his chin. The steam-hammer came
across with a thud, and the fight was over. On
the form disclosed in the last two engagements,
Criqui should make a great match with Godfrey.
There is little doubt that it will materialise if the
Frenchman is willing; but when last sounded he
viewed the idea without enthusiasm.
* * * *
Alf Grenda’s fine pedalling was the feature
of Sydney cycling carnival on Saturday. In a
special match he defeated J. G. Atkins (N.S.W. mile
champion) in two straight heats in 2min. 6 l-ssec.
and 2min. Csec. ; and in the five-mile scratch he
brilliantly cut out Jackie Clark and Hans Ohrt
(America) in 12min. 20sec. The long Tasmanian is
having a monopoly of the prize-money this season.
* * * *
The inter-State 16-foot cdiampionship was
sailed on Port Jackson last Saturday. Nineteen skiffs
faced the long championship course in a light sou’-
easter, and the Queensland representatives Agnes (T.
Deane), Nile (J. Watts) and Memory (V. Lucas)
soon showed their off-the-wind qualities. Agnes was
first to haul a breeze at the light, with half a
minute to spare, from Valetc, one of the few N.,S.
Wales craft to show up in the race, and Valete was
6sec. ahead of Nile. Clar Melv, splendidly handled by
A. Whereat, displaced Valete after a while, execrable
extra-setting on the part of the Sydney crew being
to blame. Agnes ultimately lobbed home with
30see. to spare from Clar Melv, which in turn held
a 3sec. advantage over Nile, the third Bananalander,
whilst Memory lifted fourth money. Dart (P.
Mills), which came fifth, was the first N. S. Wales
boat to cross the line.
* * * *
W. Herald, Manly club’s Olympic rep.,
did the hundred in 57 3-6 sec. on Saturday. This
is 1 l-ssec. better than Tod Solomon’s club record.
He is training hard for Kealoha, who beat him by
only four feet over the 100 metres’ course at the
Games.
* * * *
Bananaland’s champion sprint swimmer,
E. S. Collin, caused a stir at the Booroodabin en-
closure last week, by carving out the 220yds.
breast-stroke event in 3min. 7sec., which are new
figures for the distance in Australia. Although
accomplished in fresh water, the swim is only
2sec. slower than C. Atkinson’s world’s best, estab-
lished at Wanganui (M.L.) in February, 1913.
* * * *
A one-time well-known N. S. Wales athlete,
H. F. H. Wyse, has just gone west. At 18 he won
long-distance running and walking championships in
Maorilaiul and later lyas well known on the tracks in
N. S. Wales. He long held the pole record, and at
Orange when he was 47 he won a vaulting contest
against competitors from all over the State.
* * * *
Ernest Barry having failed within three
months to clinch Dick Arnst’s challenge, the hefty
Maorilander claims the world’s sculling champion-
ship. Arnst out-raced the other challengers with his
£lOO deposit after the Felton fiasco; and Barry’s
retirement gives him the championship again. Pat
Hannan (M.L.) has, the first challenge to Arnst, and
■ other hungry scullers will have to wait till this argu-
ment is over.
Fred Searl, who died at Strathfield
(N.S.W.) recently, was one of the most enthusiastic
of bowlers. He played with Petersham, and helped
that club’s rink land the Rawson Cup in three suc-
cessive years; and he tripped with the Australian
team that had a royal time in England in 1912. He
was 64 at the end.
* * * *
One of the toughest nuts J. R. Hooper
will have to crack before he wins the English bil-
liards championship is the holder, S. H. Fry. Fry
is in great v form, judging by his play in the first
round. He defeated Fraser Farrer by 2000 to 821
and exceeded the century once, making a break of
101. Fry is the son of a well-known English book-
maker.

An ambitious attempt to make its newly-
acquired allotment at Kooyong the “Wimbledon of
Australia” is involving the Vic. Lawn Tennis Associ-
ation in a noble cadge for funds. Owing to a
neighboring creek threatening to overflow after heavy
rain, the ground has to be protected and this and
other works have already consumed £9269, exclusive
of £2434 for the land. There is a bill of £16,781
in sight for grandstands and so forth, and tennis
enthusiasts are cheerfully parting up for 6 p.c. deben-
tures to keep the scheme going. The main reason for
this elaborate outlay is to make the ground fit to
stage the Davis Cup ; and beyond the Cup there are
only the annual championships to bring a bit of
coin into the hat. The Association has to reckon on
possible expense, too, in keeping the ground dry. It
is a low-lying area, and has the further disadvantage
of being a good tram-ride from Melbourne. The
old courts at the Albert Ground were superior for
position and convenience, at any rate.

“Furph” (Noo Yoick) : It is rumored here
that Hughes will himself be the first High Commis-
sioner at Washington, which means that it will have
to be an Embassy. As the last Australian Budget
scuppers the idea of an effective navy, his staff will
presumably not include a naval attache. To fill the
vacancy in the entourage I beg to urge the appoint-
ment of a sporting attache. For over a fortnight
since November 2 loyal Australians in New York have
made daily pilgrimage to the little office on the 30th
floor of a Broadway scraper where Mark Sheldon rolls
up his sleeves as plain Commissioner for Australia,
but without avail. He is unable to tell us what won
the Cup.
BLIND JUSTICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A number of two-up players appeared before
a Sydney suburban police-court on Thursday. The
magistrate explained regretfullv that as they had
been charged with playing ‘in the tush' instead of
‘in a public place’ he had no option but to order
their imprisonment over the festive season. Had
they played publicly he could have merely fined
them.” —New a item.
Jones belonged to a two-up school, and Brown to a
city club:
Brown risked money behind brick walls and Jones
in the waving scrub.
In short, Brown played in privacy, a thing Jones
never could do —
And neither, unless you had a club to do it in,
could you.
Jones was anxious to play in peace, which was why
he sought the bush,
Where, concealed by shelt’ring trees, men may
gamble beneath the cush.
“If ■ Brown is safe, then we are safe,” so reasoned
the two-up school.
Jones cordially agreed with this, thus proving himself
a fool.
Haled to court he excused himself: “I played,”
he argued, “by stealth —
Played close hid from the public eye, like men of
fashion and wealth.”
“Yes,” the magistrate shrewdly said, “and that’s
where you crashed, my lad.
“Play henceforth in a public place. And now I’ve a
duty sad.
“Take a spell in the Long Bay gaol.” “Good
heavens!” cried Jones aghast—
“Sent to prison! You mean to say the Law sees this
diff’rence vast
’Twixt my failing and that of Brown, who gambles
by day and night!
If it’s so, then the Law’s an ass, stone-blind to what’s
just and right.”
“Cut that out,” said the magistrate, “and learn this
undying truth:
What you do doesn’t mean so much to an Act, my
festive youth.
Where you do it, and how, and when, in fact whom
you chance to be—
These count most with Statute Law in this land
of the brave and the free.”

GOOD HEALTH—Have You Got It?
My Scientific Exercises are keys to Health and Strength.
Your health and strength depend upon exercise. Exercise is the
judicious movement of the organs of the body, so that they will
NOT become flabby through want of use. When an organ becomes
flabby it cannot carry out its functions in a natural way. It goes
from bad to worse. Eventually it is a source of never-ending
annoyance—then chronic ill-health.
Judicious exercise is the key of Health. It cuts out
monotony, accomplishes permanent results quickly, takes up
very little time —every movement goes right to the spot.
My Postal Course of Health
and Strength Exercises
will make you fit and keep you strong and healthy. The
exercises you receive will be most suited to your individual
needs just as the particulars you furnish tell me you require.
Write your name and address across this advertisement and
send it to me with three stamps, and I will send you a
copy of my interesting booklet, “Health and Strength from
Self-Culture.”

Whence comes
all that is
Exclusive
Town has been like a stirred aivts’ nest for
the Christmas shopping. This year there has
been an epidemic of toy wheelbarrows. Thou-
sands of youngsters have been in the streets
at one time wheeling the disease in wrapping
paper. There have been awful casualties in
consequence. Tin whistles have been trampled
to death and Jap dolls suffocated. The cries
of the wounded and bereft have been pitiful.
The- generals of the army—mostly mother or
auntie—have been demoralised early in the
proceedings and have followed the battle with
the look of the lost.
Three senior members of the Bar, H. W.
Bryant, 11. I. Cohen and J. It. McFarlan,
have taken silk —the K.C. is given by State
Order-in-Council. Peacock was in the
Thrner Cabinet when it created a former
batch pf silks, who lasted for a very long
while. Bryant has very nearly been a Bar-
leader for many years, but somehow others
have time after time forged ahead of him.
The selection of the three has come as a
sharp the publie that the per-
sonnel of the first line of the Vic. Bar has
changed notably in recent years.
The few members who refused to take the
salary increases in the House of Beps have
dwindled to an almost imperceptible minority.
Best, who talked loudest against the grab,
has, on the advice of his constituents,
accepted the extra with pain. Francis, who
is Mayor of Malvern, has yielded to the same
pressure. Stewart and Gibson, of the
Country party, have also fallen into line, and
now there is not a genuine anti-grabber in
the Reps, except Brfice, whose burnished hair
and exquisite style bewitched Flinders at the
last election.
Walter Lucas, chief of the Expropriation
Board at Kabaul, is having an exciting
tussle in Melbourne with a small army of
brides. They are not Lucas's own brides —
he is not a Mormon —but they are a great
responsibility, all the same. Returned sol-
diers are being placed on plantations and at
other work in New Britain and the Islands.
Every soldier who finds a job hurries to get
married —if he be not already married—and
naturally wants his best girl shipped with
him. Lucas will not have this. lie wants
his staff army to be mobile. A man must
be tested at his work before he becomes a
fixture. Proved unsuited to one thing, he
would possibly be useful at another. More-
over, some of the staff jobs can only be
temporary, and few of them are stationary.
The men of these temporary jobs have a big
chance, later, of a plantation. There is great
work to be done in the settlement of the ex-
soldiers ; but this takes time and toil. Tho
blfides and their ’grooms count Lucas hard
and unfeeling. The fuss is gigantic, and
susceptible members are taking the matter
up in the House.
A congestion of brides at Rabaul would
be tragic—of bride.s waiting to be shipped
to husbands in far islands or till the loca-
tion of the said husbands was stationary.
The question of housing the men before they
are distributed has been a problem. An
equally sudden invasion of women looking
for quarters would drive the Administration
crazy.
Nothing has been heard of the once-familiar
name of Clara Southern since the growing
demand for Australian landscape paintings
set in. Clara, who became Mrs. Flinn in
private life, has been nursing a sick husband
for years past, and now that her long, long
task is over and the devoted wife is a widow
with a ripened experience of hills and soli-
tudes and river-valleys, her friends are urging
her to get re-wedded to the art she loved so
well. There was always something poetic in
the Clara Southern pictures, and it is one of
the compensations of sorrow that it rarely
fails to add charm to an artist’s work.
From a gadabout in London : —•
You are shortly to have a visit from Lord and
Lady Airedale and their two daughters. Both the
girls—the Hon. Violet and the Hon. Enid Kitson — ;
are pretty, and pa plays the piano as well as any-
body in the peerage.
Mrs. Russell Jackson, whom Melbourne knew better
as Kitty Boyes, is about to trip homeward, after
having spent years in foreign parts.
The Times announces the engagement of young
Allen Leeper, son of Melbourne’s fervent Orangeman,
to Janet Christina Monteith, youngest daughter of
Vereker M. Hamilton. Leeper, who saw war ser-
vice and sustains a C.8.E., has a billet in the
diplomatic service.
Everyone is sorry that Justice Hood finds
himself in a weak state after an attack
of pneumonia, and nobody thinks the in-
valid hasn’t earned six months’ leave of
absence; but one can hardly stop one’s
teeth from clattering against the teacup
when his Honor protests that he has had
no holiday for 19 years. What are vacations
for if not to give a holiday to the learned
old gentlemen of the Bench? Barristers
may have work to keep them busy when
courts are not sitting (some barristers only
wish they had), but Judges have no briefs
to study or reserved decisions to compose
between terms. After all, the poor Judge
gets more holiday than the clerk who keeps
his bank-account, or the ordinary embezzler
whom he sentences to hard labor.
Neil Smith, late sec. to Victoria’s former
Governor Stanley, is going to drive a pen
for Governor Stradbroke. Smith allowed a
fine vocabulary to go to sleep on Sir Arthur’s
correspondence, and no doubt his wide know-
ledge of vice-regal English has made him
just the man for the approaching earl. For
some years he has been sec. of the Vic. divi-
sion of the British Red Cross, and in his
spare time —which isn’t much—he turns his
mind to his almost neglected profession of
consulting mining-engineer.
Scholastic circles were thrilled w’lien John
Drought and Miss—Peters became man and
wife at All Saints’, St. Kilda, last week.
John, who left Geelong Grammar to help
across seas, got back early last year, with the
rank of major and a Military Cross. Now he
wears a curate’s collar. He has just stepped
to All Saints’ after some months as assistant
chaplain at Geelong Grammar. His only
brother, the late Captain Charles, M.C., sleeps
under a wooden cross in France. The pair
were sons of the late Toorak Anglican canon
and his widow, who was a Godfrey. The
bride decorated the teaching staff of Mel-
bourne Grammar Prep.
The panto managements have not im-
ported all of their music this year. Fred
Hall, who used to wave a baton at the
Tivoli orchestra, has given a hand with the
music of “Humpty Dumpty” and “Sinbad the
Sailor.” In the first he is responsible for
the eccentric tune that Moon and Morris
step to os spooky figures in the half light of
a special scene in the second act. Sinbad’s
bathing scene and the quaint jazz wedding
finale in the same panto are from the same
frivolous pen.
Speaker Johnson, of the House of Reps.,
has wished his friends a Merry Christmas
in an elaborate way this year. In addition
to the usual greetings printed on expensive
cardboard and tied with ribbon, there is a re-
production of a water-color of the House
from the Speaker’s own brush. There was
a time when he described himself as an artist;
but it is a good while ago.
When Linda Phillips was six a piano was
her biggest pal, and even before that she
was improvising with extraordinary preco-
city. When she was big enough the late
Alberto Zelman took
her in hand, and
then Edouard Scharf
made a competent
pianist of her. At
the Uni. Conserva-
torium Edward Goll
kept an eye on her
scampering fingers,
but the girl was set
on composition, and
at the time had
written the music
and words of 50
songs, the best of
which were sung at
a Chamber Music
concert a while ago.
and gave her some
press clippings that
were worth keeping.
At the composers’ night of the Musical
Society of Vic. recently she woke the critics
out of their calm and harvested a fresh
crop of adjectives. The clever girl, who is
providing much of the music for A. C.
Bartleman’s coming song recital, is a P’ran
native, and it is a P’ran photographer,
Gainsborough, who gives you her latest
smile.
The Dowager Countess Roberts, widow of
“Bobs,” is dead. Australians knew the
brother of Lady Roberts—Bews, of Warrnam-
bool, who lived for years in the Western
District.
The Stewart Balmains —she was a Fair-
bairn —tare off for another look at deah
Europe. The two sons are to have their
education in the Fog. It is sufficient if the
sheep grow up in the sunshine.
Dr. Kent Hughes and Mrs. Hughes gave a
party at their Toorak home to 30 cripples
from the Free Kindergarten at Carlton.
Motors were sent for the youngsters, and Dr.
Vera Scantlebury, sister Faith Ireland, Miss
Glendinning and matron Wilson, of the
Children’s Hospital, helped to give them a
lovely time.
Artist Ida Rentoul Outhwaite is due here
in a few weeks. In London she has been
selling fairies like hot cakes.
Lucy, the flapper-daughter of the late Rear-
Admiral Tickell, and of Mrs. Tickell, of Del-
mira, Kew, has promised to share the name
and alphabet of John W. Wright, A.R.V.I.A.
Arthur Barlow’s widow has made a second
matrimonial engagement. The solitaire was
giyen by a son of the Crombie Smiths, of
Hillside, Upper Hawthorn.
The Scobie Mackinnons have gone down to
I ortsea, where they have acquired an acreage
large enough almost for a sheep-run. The
Toorak palace just missed being taken as a
new State vice-regal residence. Mrs. Scobie,
who was a John Sirnson girl, looks a heart-
broken woman since the loss of her adored
only daughter Margot, who passed out after
an appendicitis operation. The only Mac-
kinnon son, Donald, is at Geelong Grammar.
Friends of “Queen Emma,” the imperious
lady who practically ruled German New
Guinea in its very early days, and who b.uilt
up one of the greatest of the businesses which
the Expropriation Board has now to handle,
describe her as of the most generous instincts
and her hospitality was boundless. It was
not her fault that the Germans had any part
of New Guinea : she favored her father’s
people, and her father was British Consul in
Samoa. s Later, when her husband, Forsayth,
died leaving but one son, and it became de-
sirable to float the business into a public
co. or at any rate bring in outsiders, her
efforts to interest English people failed; they
were not prepared to put their money into ;i
German colony. So the German co. was
formed ; and that led on to the lady’s second
marriage, with one Kolbe. He and his wife
died a very few years ago within a day or so
of one another in Europe.
Treasurer McPherson has given a year’s
Ministerial salary to the Uni. fund. A little
while ago he posted a cheque for a thou,
to tlie Scotch College building fund, and
the Hawthorn Tech, lias had more from him
than he has ever mentioned from a housetop.
Mrs. Biiesst, who, with her small grand-
daughter and young Keith Garvie, is track-
ing half-way round the globe to visit her
scattered family, sends first a coo-ee from
’Frisco, and then a long-drawn shriek of
horror at the outrageous cost of living under
the Stars and Stripes. The prices of
clothes, food and hotel accommodation are
“fierce,” and passengers by train or vessel
are stung outrageously for extras, Prohibi-
tion —;which is America’s present whipping-
boy—is blamed for these highway robberies.
The Biiesst party found the home of the
Jap race clean and picturesque but expen-
sive. They incidentally embellished their
life’s history by weathering a typhoon, which
was a revelation in thrills and noises in out-
sizes.
The ship-owning Jimmie Mills’s son, who
served with the GOth King’s Royal Rifles,
lately wedded in England the Hon. Mrs.
Philip Fitzalan Howard. Mrs. Phil is a
good-looking war widow in the early twen-
ties, her first venture being a son of Lord
Howard, of Glossop. The James Mills lady
has family connections herself; she was one
of three beautiful, well-born, impoverished
Irish girls who came to M.L. in the long
ago to seek their fortunes governessing and
the like, but all married well at the earliest
opportunity. All had gorgeous complexions,
and were proud of them—-it was commonly
believed in Maoriland that Mrs. Monson,
one of the three, regularly bathed in milk.
One of the patients at Melbourne Hospi-
tal last week had got there in a quite un-
usual way. He came in the first place with
two companion mariners to see a sick friend.
It was late, and they were not in the right
state -for seeing anybody very clearly, so
their p'rayer for admission was refused. One
of them vowed he was going upstairs with-
out permission, whereupon his less fussy
mates expostulated, and one of them hit
the rowdy one so hard that he did go up-
stairs.
Comedian Theo Leonard has left the lime-
light for a rest at Wagga, where with a male
relation he has acquired a hotel. Mrs. Theo,

David Low, from London, November 21:
To-day is the first anniversary of my burst into
English print. I never want to work so hard again
in this life. Things are a good deal better now,
though, and I turn out my daily cartoon with more
freedom ; but the awful sweat and toil of having to
learn up the new people and the new politics kept
me so close at it that But I suppose it was
worth while. The results include a much-extended
view of humanity, and that’s worth a bob or two.
Lately I have actually managed to scrape a little
spare time to break into the “higher flights”—
book-illustration, etc. The Graphic has been pub-
lishing a page or two also. The future looks good
enough. Harrison Owen seems to be doing all right;
he is now cropping up here and there pretty fre-
quently. I have no doubt that he will arrive with
bells on ultimately; for Fleet-street is hungry for
humorous jingle.
The present Davis Cup in Auckland will
probably be Norman Brookes’s last appear-
ance in international tennis. Norman has
spent a lot of time wandering from .court to
court in recent years, and has a feeling that
he would like to be a married man again.
Engineer-Lieutenant Brett has left the
Navy, taken a little house ashore and settled
in business .in Melbourne. Mrs. Brett—a
pretty, fair girl—comes from military circles,
dad having been a major in the 14th Hussars!
Brett has a title in his family ; the late Lord
Mowbray was his cousin. Tasmania’s ex-
Governor Gormanston was connected, too.
Ronald Glen, the new sea. of the
Alfred Hospital, specialised in the con-
trol of -war hospitajs in England, France
and elsewhere. He
was in command
of tlie Auxiliary Hos-
pital at Dartford,
and had just got the
Kitchener Hospital
in working order
when he was
switched to Abbeville,
in France, and told
to grow a hospital
there in the shortest
possible time. He
did the job, and the
medical bigwigs
wrote his name in
many despatches.
Previous to going to
England he had the
Abassia Hospital,
near Helouan, Cairo,
under his win*?, and he also helped in the
medical organisation on Gallipoli. The
reputation he had won was shown on the
outbreak of the ’flu epidemic in Melbourne,
when he was handed the management of the
emergency hospital at Broadmeadows.
Young, vigorous and experienced, he has
great hope and faith in the Alfred, but
yearns for the best part of £51,000 to make
it what it should be.
Sister Adelaide, at 109° in the shade:—
The Weigalls struck a blazing day for their first
garden-party and tucked themselves as far lack as
they could into the shade of the house while they
shook hands with their 3000 or so guests. The
procession crawled slowly—very slowly—from the
entrance gates up the drive and across the southern
lawns to the strip of red carpet, and was mostly
red of face and moist of hand by the time it got
there. The vice-regal host and hostess stuck it
nobly, though small Patricia gave it up and retired.
Lady Weigall smiled in a foamy frock of rare lace
and georgette topped by a droopy hat with a touch
of silver blue and shaded by a Paris-built sunshade
of black and gold. Sunshades were the item of the
dressing. Mayoress Moulden’s was a transparent thing
of lace, but the Japanese affairs that were on every
Sydney beach a year ago sunned themselves proudly
as the latest trick. There were bright spots in the
dressing—net frocks that were a joy in their cool-
ness and grace, and one adorable garment of white
georgette and lace that showed a glimmer of a rose-
festooned petticoat beneath. The vice-regal exodus
to Marts]e Hill is billed for this week, and it’s
glad they’ll be to get there.
The Supreme Court has turned down Miss Kitson’s
application to be a notary public, not because it
doubts her ability for the job but because the Act
that allowed woman to become a lawyer doesn’t
include notary in the list of offices she may fill. Our
thousand and one women’s societies will soon get
that put right.
The Acacias, the Edwin Smith old home at Marry -
atville, is to be a Homan Catholic convent, and
the young person now studying at Loreto, Norwood,
is to be transferred there almost at once.
The Methodies, very strong in S. Aus., have opened
a “Memorial” hospital to hold 72 beds. It began
by acquiring Ru Rua, a private hospital opposite
the Adelaide Oval; then, funds rolling in, it bought
the adjoining Simpson Newland and Magarey homes,
right up to the Children’s Hospital. Old J. M.
Mcßride of the Burra, the largest subscriber, did the
official opening, though he is close on 90.
Sun blazed down upon the Wards of the Nation
Fete, when a Christmas treat for the children of
men who fell in the war or are now in military
hospitals was held at the Jubilee Oval. Balloons
innumerable floated gaily from a tree in the centre
of the ground, long tables piled with parcels were
on the grass in front *of the grandstands, there was
every kind of side-show, from Punch and Judy to a
bored donkey that took the children for rides, and
there were ices and sweets and drinks. The
Weigalls came in time for Priscilla to hand out
the first of’ the parcels, and that young person went
away with a gift or two for herself. The show
was chiefly run by the Mothers’ Band —women who
have had sons of their own at the war, and who
have made the care of fallen soldiers’ dependants
their post-war job.
In the evening there was an At Home in the
Mayoress’s reception-room at the Town Hall, where
A. G. Fenner auctioned a flag on what we call the
Bugler system, and raised £920 for Christmas com-
forts for the men at the Bedford Park and Myrtle
Bank hospitals for consumptive soldiers. The ensign,
which had been autographed by Jellicoe, was finally
knocked down to Syd Kidman for £230 10s.
The artist Coates couple were on board the incom-
ing Morea, and may come back to this village with
some of their canvases when they have been to the
Eastern States.
The Bach Society struck a sweltering night for its
performance of “The Messiah” in aid of the Soldiers’
Cemetery Fund, but for all that there was almost a
full house at the Town Hall. The soloists were
Millie Revell, Lilian Wilkinson, Leslie Martin and
Sydney Coombe, all of them in good form, though
limp rags at the end of two hours’ stewing.


Of course you want
PLUME ?
The garage man knows Benzine values.
He knows that a satisfied customer comes
again and brings his friends. That is why
such a number of garage fnen say :
“Of course you want Plume?”
They know that Plume gives genuine
continued satisfaction that it gives easy
starting, quick acceleration, full power, and
good mileage.
Satisfy yourself that these are not
empty statements. Put Plume to the test
on the steepest hills ; test it
on the level for power and
mileage. Test it for easy
starting on a cold morning.
You will be delighted with the
result. When ordering, ask
for Plume —don’t say Benzine.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
David
Jones
Catalogue
The Victoria League extended its best
white kids to Lady Forster last week, and
the Women’s Club was chosen as the spot in
which to lay down the welcome mat. The
Cullen lady, who is president of the close
corporation, was mistress of ceremonies, in
dove grey crepe de Chine, and a flowery black
hat; her Ex. took the oath of allegiance in
pastel tints with a dash of navy. Mrs.
Brodrick, who came under the vice-regal
wing, also wore a dress of undetermined
shades and a big black hat. Among the
also-present were the Elworthys and Miss
Tripp, held up by the strike on their way
back to Maoriland. (The Elworthy dia-
monds, by the way, were a feature of the
Orvieto dinner-hour.) And, of course, all
Sydney Society that is still broiling in town.
There were two kinds of receptions at
Parliament House within the past fort-
night—the one given to the Premier’s wife
by the Ministry's missus, when - the guest
was presented with a handsomely-fitted tra-
velling-bag (and you don’t find them handed
out with a pound of tea these days) ; the
other the reception given by Premier John
and his party to the down-at-heel and poorly-
nourished mothers from the slums who had
come with hope in their hearts from Surry
Hills and Miller’s Point, from Alexandria
and the ’Loo. After all, why worry—hasn’t
it been written that those who ask for
bread shall be given a stone? And wasn’t
there long ago a Christmas babe against
whose poor parents the doors of the inns
were shut?
The Sailors’ Wives were in high feather
the other afternoon when Lady Forster came
to the farewell tea poured out in honor of the
treasurer of the Friendly Union, Mrs. Can-
ning, who is leaving for England. There was
a gold brooch for the lady, and this was handed
over by her Ex., who wore georgette of old-
fashioned “milkmaid” blue—it suggests wide-
apart blue eyes and innocence and Devon-
shire cream, though the fluff merchants and
“Irene” have taken away its atmosphere
and called it Alice .blue. With this was worn a
.cornflower-wreathed hat. and a pink and
mauve bouquet. President Mrs. Edwards
threw the soft word to Mrs. Canning. Mrs.
Cumberlege, the Leroy Duck mother with her
pretty honey-haired chick, Mrs. Miller, the
courtly Dumaresq and Engineer-Commander
Canning were a tiny bit of the party which
endorsed Mrs. Canning’s certificate of good
conduct.
Tom Heney, gentlest and most courteous
of editors, slipped away from Sydney last
week to take the helm of the Brisbane
Telegraph, Dr. Ward’s old paper. Journal-
ists —as many as could muster to a short-
notice rally—met at the Press Club to say
good-bye and good luck. Mrs. Heney gave
wifely support to the Institute’s first and
only president; Mary Gilmore and Mrs. Cur-
lewis came in for a parting word; so did
Dowell O’Reilly, looking as gentle and fine
as his new book “Five Corners,” and Tom
finally went off with a volume of Ure Smith’s
etchings under his arm, and more good
wishes than his simple soul ever dreamt
would follow him to his new domain.
Goulburn almost regards Governor David-
son and Dame Margaret as its property.
Every time is has asked them to come and
open a show or do any other little local job
they have consented promptly. Now they have
accepted the invitation of the Tirranna Pic-
nic Race Club to the annual races on
January 13 and 14. This time they will
stay at Springfield, A. L. Faithfull’s home,
whei’e they will be shown the post behind
which sheltered one of the bushrangers who
put up a fight with the four young Faith-
fulls on a morning in February, 1865. The
affray, which took place just outside the
gates of Springfield, is one which old hands
recount with pride. Four of the Faithfull
boys were driving into Goulburn, when they
were attacked by Ben Hall, Gilbert and
Dunn. One of the boys had a single-
barrelled rifle, another a revolver, the other
two were unarmed. They opened fire. Gil-
bert, mounted on the stolen racehorse Young
Waverly, rode up to within 20 yards of the
brake, pulled np, and fired his revolver. The
horse threw up its head, and the bullet
struck it just - behind the ears, killing it on
the spot. Gilbert then took refuge behind a
post, -which stopped a bullet intended for
him, and after further firing, the boys, their
ammunition finished, retreated to the house.
On their return, reinforced and with better
arms, the ’rangers had gone'. The racehorse
which was killed ran on the Goulburn course
in 1863. If the Governor and his wife ask
Miss Faithfull for details, they will hear as
good a story as any they could dig up in the
State —far better than they would get from
any of the brothers. They -were the original
Diggers in their modesty. By the way,
Percy, one of them, settled these many years
at Neutral Bay, leaves with his wife on a
visit to Maoriland early in January.
James Burns gave away his youngest
daughter, Caroline Amy, in the seclusion of
the Gowan Brae drawing-room last week.
The young man is Lieutenant Ray Pierson.
D.S.C., R.N.. who was supported by chum
Alexander. The wedding party was of the
tiniest —besides the family, just old Parra-
matta friends like the Bettingtons and a
Bowman or two. The bride dressed herself
in Jersey silk.
Everybody who got a card went to the
dance on the Tingira last week. There was*
some idea that a breath of the sea might find
its way down the spinal column, even as far
perhaps, as the knee-caps, and certainly there
was a bit more in its favor than any other jazz-
party of the week could boast. For the rest
it was the usual hop aboard, with the same
people to criticise one another as in the
beginning of things.
The other women who were on the Sonoma
with Ola Jane Humphrey Ilassan Broadwood
still, talk of the wonderful dressing of the
lady on the trip across. One afternoon, for
the sports tournament, the ex-Princess
knocked everybody in the eye with a costume
carried out in tones of yellow shaded from
palest primrose to newly-minted sovereign.
Nearly all her evening gowns are black, back-
less, with gold designs. Her favorite wrap
was a midnight hue, with large gold beetles
having monster green eyes beaten (so it
would seem) into them. Going ashore at
Honolulu she was gowned in her favorite
black and gold, with a Baronda turban, rising
into a gorgeous gold brush from the centre
front upon her head, a gold fringe several
feet in length finishing off the skirt, and a
brilliant illumination swathed Carmen-like
around her hips.
An arrival by the Sonoma was Mrs. Nelson
with a portfolio of photographs of daughter
Gwen, who is kept busy dancing in films, and,
besides, has now a small singing part in a
Broadway attraction, “Honeymoon Nights.”
The newly-married Bert Evatts, finding
their honeymoon trip by the Niagara post-
poned indefinitely through the usual Christ-
mas strike —this year it was the stewards'
turn to hold things up—had the unexpected
luck to find berths in the Sonoma. But the
delay means that they will have only about a
fortnight in the U.S.A.
This is Ruby Coxhead, the clever leader of
Sydney’s clever amateur dramatics, the Yaga-
boiuls. The little group held together all
through the war, and
is still working in
the most friendly
way in the world,
principally because
no one person wants
to be lead all the
time, and because
each one is out to
help to the utmost
the charity of the
moment. Formed at
the beginning qjf the
war to aid patriotic
funds, the members
decided that no per-
sonal outlay should
take away from the
profits, and they have
re d need expenses
almost to vanishing
point. If you know any member of the Vags.
don’t confide to her that you possess a single
presentable rag, for she’ll beg, borrow or
steal it for the next performance. “Costumes”
have never been among the debits on their
little sheet. Their energies at present are
directed to the endowment of a cot in the
Renwick Hospital.
Mrs. Hart, of Bowral, with daughter Ger-
trude, leaves for Europe at the beginning of
the year. Daughter Gertrude was at school
in Belgium when war broke out in 1914, and
her parents, here in Australia, went through
a horrible week of anxiety until a cable
reached them assuring them of her safety.
At the first hint of trouble an aunt in
Ireland had rushed over, and just managed
to get her niece clear of the trouble. The
travellers will spend a few weeks in Italy
before going on to England for the Spring.
The kindergartens emptied themselves
into beflowered lorries and drags in the
early days of last week, and the Little Citi-
zens, the Miller’s Pointers, the Montessoris
and hundreds of other baby Portias and
Premiers were lifted down at Farmer’s
doors, marshalled two by two through the
mercery up the back stairs and into the man-
nequin theatre, where Polly Perkins and her
tiny friends Christmas Bush, Christmas
Bell, Waratah and Flannel Flower danced
for them and sang with them till Godfather
Cockrane, the biggest baby of all. cascaded
into glittering globules of joy all over his
bald patch. They were jolly parties these,
ending up with Santa Claus, a Christmas-
tree and a tea-party in the big marquee
on the ground where the Firm’s new butter-
fly net is soon to be spread.
There’s to be a masked ball at the Went-
worth on New Year’s Eve. Powder and
patches and domino—what material for a
Mary Forrest outburst of red roses and hot
passion, of jealous husbands and Lochinvar
lovers! Only, alas, there are no assigna-
tions in the garden or on the corkscrew-
stair for the modern missus. Cupid’s new
weapon, the automatic, prevents any
romance being “continued in our next.”
Whereas Cupid’s dart merely punctuated an
affair with a comma or an exclamation-
mark, the automatic has an abrupt way of
making a full-stop in crimson. As Edward
Dyson wrote:—
The fair young lover takes his sweet and walks be-
neath tlie moon ;
In blue translucent atmosphere all nature is a-swoon ;
He does not talk to her of doves, or roses burning red,
But takes his automatic out, and shoots her through
the head.
All of which has nothing to do with the
Wentworth. Stick to the jaz£ and let the
gardens take care of themselves!
The second Rupert Clarke infant duly
arrived, and insisted on being another boy,
although all the ribbons had been changed
from blue to pink in the hope of inducing a
girl-baby to give the glad eye to the Baronet’s
nurseries. ' These rooms are the most gor-
geous places, with nursery-rliyme pictures to
paper the walls (made in America, these;
though if Rupert had only known there are
a dozen Australian girls could have given
him just the thing he wanted), and the
babies’ bathroom is inlaid with pink tiles*
on which Jack and Jill and Mother Hubbard
and Humpty Duinpty live all over again.
S’Rupert, by the way, can’t keep right out of
the show business. lie is building a “picture
palace” now at Drummoyne—almost a real
palace. Tlieo Marks is the architect, and
there’s to be a champagne opening
in Sydney, and sharpening her pen-
cils, Kathleen Ussher, of Mosman, who
went away just before war broke out to
study art. She made a start in Chicago,
then rushed into war jobs, doing canteen duty
in Salonika, and working with the “Wrens”
on Gibraltar, Kathleen has just written and
illustrated a clever sketch for Aussie and a
cover for “The Aspen Tree,” a book of pre-
cocious verse that Tyrrell’s is publishing.
In Chicago she let herself loose over the
illustrations of the Edward Lear copybooks.
Her job was to make a picture to go with the
quaint little verse at the top of each page,
and she did it in the most charming manner
imaginable.
A couple of weeks ago Colonel Oswald
Watt and his brother Ernest decided to
throw away a few hundred pounds on a
racehorse. It has been Oswald Watt’s
boast for some 20 years that he knows no-
thing whatever about horses, though he
owns a station or two and spends a lot of
time up-country; and his brother’s tastes
are mainly literary and dramatic. Natu-
rally the animal won at the first time of
asking last week, the price being eights, and
the owners both having fair sums on at
that figure. It is what the Ring in its bit-
terness calls beginner’s luck.
Mrs. Bertie Kelly is not returning to
Australia just yet, after all, and her hus-
band has left to join her in London. The
whole family is now in foreign parts, Maisie
Kelly of the wonderful voice having mar-
ried a soldier of the same name, though no
relation, and settled in England, and Willie,
the ex-M.P., being domiciled more or less
permanently anywhere between. Bond-street
and the Rue de la Paix.
Ex-Governor Beauchamp has gone into
collaboration-with Marie Corelli. At any
rate, he has allowed the films to reproduce
Madresfield Court as the model English
home in the lady’s “Innocent.”
The Niagara brought the Syd Hoskins
couple back to Sydney. They have been
away for the past nine months visiting Eng-
land and America. Everywhere they went
they found prices sky-high, but they weren’t
so used to them that they didn’t gasp when
£l5O was asked for a five-days’ passage
across the Atlantic by a big Cunard liner.
Kathleen Hoskins, who has been abroad too,
got back just in time for her 21st birthday.
A dance was given as a welcome to her by
her sister, Mrs. Crago, of Strathfield.
One who was present at the dinner given
lately to E. R. Abigail on his return from
“abroad” tells the story. H. D. Morton, ex-
Speaker, was in the chair. On his right was
the guest of the evening, and on his ieft was
Maddocks Cohen, who is a Hebrew. Abigail
is net. The chairman, in responding to a vote
of thanks, said he felt “like the blank page
between the Old and the New Testaments.”
Court news from Port Moresby:—
His Excellency Judge Murray, the man whom “only
the King can shift,” will sail for the South by the
Morinda on December 15, leaving his Honor Judge
Herbert to watch the seething hot-pot. What with
the planters’ native-labor troubles and the discontent
amongst the Government officials anent the recently-
nublished classification of, the Public Service, the pot
is at boiling point, and it needs a skilful cook to
avoid catastrophe. Judge Murray will make his
annual visit south to find the wherewithal to replenish
the exchequer, which at the present time is sadly
empty.
Would you like to buy time? Dozens
of little ones are doing it every week at
their music lessons with Mary Cochran at
the Conservatorium. This teacher, because
she loves children as
much as she loves
music, has evolved a
system of teaching
the piano that
simply lures the-
baby mind and
hand. She doesn’t
talk of lessons, she
agrees with Dr.
Montessori that
children are only
interested in play-
ing ; therefore every-
thing is a game,
and clef and notes
and rests are learned
by actually hand-
ling them in stiff-
paper models. The
children play shop.
buying and selling crotchets, quavers, semi-
quavers and the expensive minim. They
know that if /they play softly the fairies
who live in the piano will sing softly to
them, but if they bang the goblin will come
out and make perfectly horrid noises. They
learn to relax muscles by the sleepy game,
and end up a happy afternoon by the biscuit
game that saves them from going home
hungry.
A suburban preparatory school has had a
festive breaking-up. Being friendly with
the head-mistress the local dramatic club
undertook to amuse the children with a fairy
play, “Bt. George and the Dragon,” but St.
George was rather too tumultuous. He had
been hitting the bottle rather hard, and when
lie arrived on the improvised stage in his
hired armor he mistook himself for a real
knight, and clasped the fair Una to his
spiky breast until she shrieked. Then he
went for the dragon with astonishing ferocity.
This was the part of the proceedings that
the kids enjoyed most. St. George’s weapon,
though not deadly, must have hurt, for the
dragon made violent efforts to escape,
finally parting in the middle and dodging in
two pieces about the platform, while the
champion of virtue nerformed prodigies of
valor with his whirling blade. Then the
scandalised elders tried to interfere; but the
lied Cross knight prodded the Mayor's bulg-
ing shirt-front with his property sword and
announced his intention of rescuing all the
distressed damsels present. It was heroic
odds, but the spirit of old knighthood was
upon him. and it might have gone hard with
many of the elders had the hero not noticed a
part of the dragon escaping and gone in pur-
suit. Finally a policeman arrived, seized the
intrepid knight, and sat firmly upon his
armor. There will be no repetition of “St.
George and the Dragon”—not at that semi*
nary, anyhow.
A Brisbane postcript:—
Our new Excellency has been doing the rounds
of the military hospitals, wishing the boys Merry
Christmas, and beaming on Y.A.D.’s and Red Cross
workers. Rosemount put on its best pinny, decked
the walls with flags (mostly held in place by “issue”
forks), and enjoyed a sing-song. Just before Sir
Mat arrived a returned Digger solemnly did the
wards, uttering .a few vice-regal compliments to eacli
invalid. It was a pity our cheery Excellency didn’t
see this part of the show. He would have enjoyed
it.
The T.B. cases at Corinda and the convalescents
at Grange Hill also had decorations and a Christmas
celebration, and contralto Lena Hammond, who has
done more patriotic work than her share, pianiste
Gladys Frost and the Musical Bowlers gave sing-
songs.
Cremorne Gardens has a Christmas panto, “Cinder-
ella,” and is rewarded with packed houses. Clarice
Hardwicke, loaned by H. D. Mclntosh, is making a
hit as the Prince, while Alice Bennetto is a very
satisfactory lady who lost her shoe. Elton Black
scores heavily as the Dame, his cretonne frocks being
bright features of the show.
The Brisbane Musical Union, as usual, unpacked
its “Messiah” scores and breathed Handel over its
Christmas patrons. Eunice Cochrane (contralto)
secured the blue ribbon, though tenor Billy Crisp,
who came to conductor Sampson’s rescue when an
imported musical-box failed him, ran her a close
second, in spite of the fact that he had less than
a week to rehearse.
Edith Shand tea-ed a bunch of friends at the Gar-
dens’ Kiosk the other day in honor of Evelyn
Browne, who is to be a New Year bride.
James Cowlishaw, the “father” of the Leg.
Council, was 86 on Sunday. He has perched in the
House of Life Nominees for 42 years.
Violet Wamsley, of a squatting family, is to be
married shortly to solicitor Ellison. Numerous teas
in her honor have happened, May Fitzgerald being
the last of a series of hostesses.
Major Cyril Corser, son of the M.H.R., came
home last week. After his active service he remained
in charge of a bunch of A.I.F. students who went to
Uncle Sam to study irrigation and farming methods.
Major Tom Macleod, C. de. G., will hand the usual
gold ring to popular Ruby Shannon early in January.
The wedding will be in Toowoomba.

Paste -Li Quid - Powdered
PREPARED WAX
S YOUR linoleum dull and dead-looking? Bring it back to life and it will
reflect a bright, clean, well-cared-for home. All you need is Johnson’s Prepared
Wax and a cloth. Johnson’s Wax brings out the pattern of linoleum—preserves
and protects it from wear. It doesn’t take long —an ordinary sized floor can
be polished in less than an hour and it may be walked upon immediately.
The Secret of Beautiful Floors
Beautiful floors are largely a matter of prevention the great secret is to put
them in perfect condition and then keep them that way. Doorways, stair-
treads and other parts receiving hard usage should be polished
frequently. This requires no great amount of time or effort if the
proper finish is used.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax Paste is the proper finish for floors of all kinds—wood,
tile, marble, composition and linoleum. It does not show scratches
or heel-prints and floors polished with it can easily be kept in
perfect condition.

Rejuvenate Your Furniture
with J ohnson’s Prepared Wax Liquid. It imparts a hard, dry, velvety
polish of great beauty and durability. Use it also on your leather goods,
woodwork and automobiles. Johnson’s Prepared Wax forms a thin,
protecting coat over the varnish, similar to the service rendered by
a piece of plate glass over a desk or dresser top.
Your dealer has a JOHNSON’S 99 —do not accept a substitute.

GRASSHOPPER
OINTMENT
Draws Out the Poisons.
Impurities in the blood produce many ailments, including boils, ulcers, carbuncle,
bad legs, certain forms of eczema and rheumatism. Albert’s Grasshopper
Ointment does not drive these poisons back into the system, where they would
be likely to attack the lungs, heart, liver or other organs. Owing to its
powerful absorptive properties it draws the impurities absolutely out of the
system. This restores the blood and skin to a pure, healthy state, and causes the
boils, ulcers, pimples, eczema, carbuncle, etc., to heal up and disappear. The
Proprietors of Grasshopper Ointment, having perfect confidence in its efficacy,
urge its use in treating all maladies due to poisoned and diseased blood. The
written testimony of a countless number of persons who, during the past half-
century, have used the Ointment with beneficial result, renders it impossible to
doubt its surpassing value in treating all blood and skin diseases. The Ointment
is absolutely harmless and contains no injurious ingredients. PLEASE
BEWARE 'OF SUBSTITUTES AND IMITATIONS.
As a tonic, liver medicine, blood purifier, and for those who suffer from
headaches, the
GRASSHOPPER PILLS
are equally effective. Do not be persuaded to purchase any substitute preparations.
GRASSHOPPER OINTMENT AND PILLS are sold by all Drug Stares and
Chemists throughout the Commonwealth.

but it is very thin porridge. . .Joy: Really, though we
hate to say it, with the cackle of the Christmas poultry
in our ears, and all the other signs of peace and
goodwill about, it is very rotten verse.... Bogie
River: You write because when you can’t sleep
“thoughts come flowing thro’ ” your head. You
ought to dam some of those thoughts and send
them... .M.M. (Sydney) :No use... .Dick B.: “Cot-
ton Wool” not smartly enough written to carry
conviction.... E.E.S.: The verse goes heavily....
Francis F.: “Our Town” is intolerably dreary....

Timber”.... Kalamaeia: Both miss; but it was
touch and g0....M00l Boel: Not enough in it....

....Oliver B.: It’s a bit late for the ’bug, but a
thing like that could never be out of season:—•

the old things in lumpy and mechanical verse....
E.C.C.: Can’t quite see a place for “The Baby
Wings”... .J.H.: “Next Year” isn’t up to your mark.
. ...0.W.H.: The matter isn’t worth attention; and
the verse is poor, anyhow. .. .R.H.M.: It has color,
but how do you pronounce “Benares”? And what
on earth is a “pixie” doing on a coral reef?....
W.T.J.: “The Hunters” ought to be better done.
Try. .. . W.J.L.: “The Star” is commonplace in poor
verse. .. .E.M.H.: Terrible.... George M.: With a

use. .. .Chunjoberree: “Darkilbo” has too many worn
phrases and obvious tags. . . .Artemus H.: Misses. .. .
J.M.C.: The verses are not up. The thought is
never very fresh; and grammar, metre and rhymes
are all shaky... .A.E.G.: “Now and Then” is not
very interesting L.V.8.: “Comics” hasn’t the
touch to carry it...,J.H.: Your account of the
deluge has a lyric quality that would carry it
through any menagerie:—
. ...J.8.L.: It is not well enough done.... Chick S.:
You’ve still a long way to go. .. .Kathleen W.:
Misses. How do you pronounce “mirage” “!....
J.M.S.Y.: They all have facility to the point of

also-ran... .C.0.T.: To read your verse is like

of Success” fails to reach the first rung. .. .D.E.:
Drawing mostly of comfy chairs; now swing them
round and show us whether you can really sketch
live people... .H.S.R.: Indefinite scratching®. ...
Rossy: Quite impossible.
Now that we have Christmas again so near,
May it bring happiness and joy;
Get your turkey and your beer,
And the toys for the girls and boys.
Of course, mother will provide with plum poo,
She always did as far as I knew ;
With brandy sauce and money too,
We ate and ate till we saw it through.
Then cheer O! cheer O ! be as happy as can be,
Whether on land or an angry sea;
See that you get your Christmas-tree,
For happiness it wilj, bring for baby and me.
Two miscreants in their filthy den
Divided goods that they’d stolen,
When one arising in his ire
Pushed the other into the fire.
The thief arose in anger fierce
To try the other’s heart to pierce;
Then each one drawing out his knife
They both engaged in deadly strife.
Till he who had been foully singed
The other ’gainst the wall impinged;
Then with one desperate dart
He stabbed him to the heart.
The lion’s roar
Doth bring to Noah
The tidings of a kingly pair:
With such address
The lioness
And he are come,
The crowd among'
To join the social gathering there.
The Bull doth sound
His bellow round,
But foamless are his nostrils now;
Nor paws the ground,
Nor glares around
With fiery spark,
But to the ark
Doth bring along his fair-eyed cow.
By two and two
This angel crew
Foregather in ensemble fine,
And Captain Noah
Doth close the door
And down doth pour
For days two score
The rain—and then again the bright
sunshine.

MRS. V. MITCHELL (from a photo.)
For years I suffered
with my kidneys, causing
backache and bad head-
aches. I saw your Gin
Pills advertised an d
thought I would give
them a trial. They worked
wonders, cleared my kid-
neys, and 1 feel a new
woman. I used to be a
sallow color, and these
pills have cleared my skin
wonderfully. I always
got up in the morning
with a terrible headache,
and feeling very tired and
languid, but since taking
your Gin Pills these aches
have completely left me.
Any woman suffering with
liver or kidney complaint
could do nothing better
than take Dr. Sheldon’s
Gin Pills.

The First New Year.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DO you remember, grey old world.
What earth was like the first New
Year?
A pallid blossom, part unfurled,
Unfinished mountains, raw and drear,
Waiting the growths of many a spring,
To weave a vernal covering?
Can you remember, grey old world,
The islands rising from the sea,
A thousand future buddings furled
In some torn flower, by a bee;
And, spawned betwixt the soil and sky,
The magic of a butterfly?
The evolution of the deer,
The delicate and antlered tiling;
The first white winter on its bier,
Grudging its sceptre to the Spring;
The shrivelled leaf that blushed with shame
When Autumn turned the woods to flame?
Ah, God ! To think of almond blooms
Adown the world ere Man had sinned!
Ah, God ! To think of turf for tombs,
And the wild requiem of the wind!
No funeral train to blackly creep,
But just a lying-down to sleep!
To think of how the forest grew
The first frail plant that made a tree;
The hollow where the primrose blew ;
Primeval petals’ mystery;
The first bound stalk that burst its sheaf
And joyed to know itself a leaf!
When, blue-eyed in the dusky grass,
How proud proemial bluebells rang!
How challenging the winds that, pass
The first-fledged bird took heart and sang,
Till, besom of the dappled blue,
The win'd caught up the music too!
Do you remember, grey old world,
The first white rain that swept your hills?
The scattered twigs by raindrops pearled,
The sudden chorus of the rills;
The indignation of the sun
To find his yellow rule was done?
Do you remember, tired world,
The first star stabbing at a cloud,
A primal moon through storm-drift hurled,
The first fine snow that wrought a shroud
About the green of little things
That knew not there were other Springs?
Do you remember quiet caves,
Where the first blinking bat drew breath;
The pioneering of the waves;
How first came Life, how first came Death ;
And, rustling through the matted brake,
Initial loopings of the snake?
Can you remember, growing old,
What life was like that first New Year?
The new Man Thing, erect and bold,
The first Brute Thing that fled the spear?
When Woman saw her rose-white grace
First mirrored in the river’s five?
Do you remember, when the morn
Had scaled the rim of midnight skies
To sow blue fields with sunlight corn,
How eyes discovered other eyes?
The broken laugh that silent grew—
The first kiss that a woman knew?
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Mistress Morgan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the City of Sydney was a few
months older than six years there
came sailing into Port Jackson
a very truculent and ungracious master-
mariner, whose ill manners and ill conduct
made a name for him that stank in the nos-
trils of Lieut.-Governor Major Francis Grose
whenever he sniffed its recollection. John
Locke was this unpleasant person’s name.
It whs about the middle of 1794 when
Captain Locke stepped ashore from his boat
in Sydney Cove, on a bright and sunny win-
ter’s day; and with him was the surgeon
of his ship, Mr. Thomas Blackburn, lately
of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London.
Captain Locke was one of those scowling,
cursing, heavy-fisted seamen who were good
navigators, indifferent gentlemen and gross
and unclean livers. Mr. Blackburn was a
young rip who had “walked” Bart.’s for
two years before he found it advisable to
leave England as hurriedly as he w T as able.
It is true that the immediate cause of his
having had to seek the sanctuary of the
South Seas was only the trifling matter of
a little body snatching, but he had been
indiscreet in the selection of his anatomical
subject. You could not, even at the end
of the eighteenth century, dig up a rich
alderman from beneath the interior pave-
ment of the church of Saint Peter upon
Cornhill, at dead of night, without getting
yourself into trouble. It had been very
lucky for the reckless medical student that
Captain Locke wanted a surgeon for the
voyage to Sydney, and that he was not
particular as to the reasons why such
surgeon swam out to his ship as she lay in
Limehouse Reach.
These were the two gentlemen who in-
vaded Sydney that bright afternoon, and
immediately betook themselves to the True
Blue Inn in Sergeant-Major’s Row. Here
they met with that very fascinating and not
uncomely lady. Mistress Dorothy Morgan—
“per ship Lady Juliana; shop-lifting; seven
years.”
Since the lady is the heroine of this story,
it is necessary to describe her also. Her
age was 27, but she might have passed for 35.
The experiences that an unprotected female
were liable to here, in those days, were un-
doubtedly a little ageing, and Dolly Morgan
had not been without her share of them. But
she had a fine black head of hair, soft brown
eyes into which she Con VI command the tears
of outraged innocence, a good bust, and a
figure that was slim and shapely. Moreover,
she was not a prude. Quite the reverse.
And that even though she could blush as
prettily as a chaste maiden of 17 who had
had no experiences at all.
The True Blue Inn, kept by ex-Sergeant
Daniel Bates of the Marines, was a funny
looking house with a thatched roof that
gave cover to not a little iniquity of such
sorts as were common in Sydney circa
1794. Two-up had not been invented then,
but less reputable kinds of gambling were
common enough, and you might indulge
in any of them here. You could not drink
anything else but very bad rum, but no one
was ever refused a drink while he had any
money. It was nearly always possible, if
you were clever enough to get in early, to
rob somebody or other. And there wer
always women—of sorts and all sorts —with
whom a man might do pretty well what he
pleased. Dan Bates was a liberal-minded
host, and seldom interfered with any gent
man’s amusements, innocent or otherwise.
It was just the place for Captain John
Locke and Surgeon Thomas Blackburn
after the long voyage which they had re-
cently concluded from the Thames.
“Bring us something to drink, ye pot-
bellied old growled the master of the
storeship Resolution to Mr. Bates as the pair
seated themselves in the dark taproom that
was also the kitchen of the establishment, the
table d’hote restaurant, and, apparently, the
sleeping apartment of mine host. “And look
alive, blast ye, else I’ll hurry ye up wi’ a
touch of bootleather.”
“Look ye,” snarled the landlord, a little re-
sentfully. “I’d have ye for to know” lie
did not conclude his observation that he was
master in hi.s own house, and would not be so
addressed, for the simple reason that Captain
Locke jumped up from the bench beside the
greasy table of roughly-adzed slabs, seized
him by the collar, and shook him till his
teeth rattled. Then he flung him into a
corner, and sat down again, growling obsceni-
ties that reflected On the landlord of the
True Blue. That astonished gentleman picked
himself up, gasping, and tremulously in-
quired what he might do for their honors.
“Didn’t you hear the captain request some
refreshment?” asked Mr. Blackburn, a trace
of annoyance in his tone.
Silently and fearfully the old soldier
hastened to place a rum-bottle and a couple of
pannikins upon the table.
“Will ’ee please to knock upon the wall if
ye want anything, gentlemen both,” mildly
requested Daniel, with much awe in his shaky
voice. “I’ve some cookin’ for to attend to at
the back.”
“Well, ye rascal, don’t go far away,”
roared Mr. Locke at the frightened old man,
“this won’t last us long. Ye’d better mind
y’self, ye !”
Humbly Mr. Bates bowed to his gentle-
manly guest, and went out the back door.
Captain Locke poured himself out a nob-
bier and drank it neat. Then he helped him-
self to another, and pushed the bottle to the
surgeon.
Mr. Blackburn looked admiringly at his
commander, and was about to say something
in approval of his effective fashion of requir-
ing service from such scum as innkeepers
when he was startled to hear a laughing
female voice that came from behind them.
He turned round, and had his first glimpse
of the lady who was to treat him so shame-
fully.
“Oh —he-he-he, I love a strong man.
Won’t you ask me to join you both?”
In the half-light of the dim interior Dolly
was almost a vision out of Heaven to
seafarers, who had been long on the
bosom of the great waters. Not unnaturally,
she approached the younger man, while she
looked admiringly at Captain Locke. The
surgeon made room for her on the bench
beside him.
“Oh, delighted, madam,” he said politely.
She was about to seat herself on the bench
beside him, when the captain reached out a
long arm, grabbed her round the waist, and
swung her on to his knee.
“No, you don’t.” he said. “Here, Black-
burn. you go to H—l out o’ this. Two’s
company. Get out —blast ye! Don’t ye
hear me?”
“Oh, certainly sir,” responded the surgeon,
almost as humble as Mr. Bates had been.
“And when may we expect ye at the boat, sir
—if I may ask?”
“Get out. ye fool! D’ye want me
to throw ye out?”
Surgeon Blackburn took the hint.
On November the 12th of that same year,
the Judge-Advocate of the Colony, Captain
David Collins, had the following affidavit
sworn before him. It gives a point of view
of the conduct of the agreeable John Locke
that is not without interest:—
William Day, serjeant in the New South Wales
Corps, came this day before me and voluntarily made
oath that he had charge of the guard which was
placed on board the Resolution, storeship, by order
of the Lieutenant-Governor, for the purpose of pre-
venting convicts or other persons being received on
board without permission; that on the morning of
the departure of the said ship from the harbor
information was sent down to the master, John
Locke, that some convicts were missing from the
Colony, and were supposed to be secreted on hoard
his ship; that he (the deponent) assisted with the
serjeant who came down in searching her, but with-
out effect; that he (this deponent) went from her
on board the Salamander to search there; that while
on hoard he perceived the Resolution getting under
way, on which he returned and caused the master to
come to an anchor; that having sent up the pilot and
the boat to receive the Lieutenant-Governor’s further
orders, that as soon as the boat was out of sight the
master again got up his anchor, notwithstanding the
remonstrances of this depondnt, who urged him to
wait the return of the boat; that the said John
Locke made use of many execrations, refusing to
wait, under an idea that he might be ordered to
return into the cove; that the Salamander’s boat
came alongside, and when the ship was between the
Heads she returned; this deponent remaining on
board with his party (three soldiers), waiting for
the return of the boat with the Lieutenant-Governor’s
orders; that the said John Locke repeatedly asserted
with curses that he would not furnish this” deponent
with a boat from the ship, but that he would cer-
tainly land him and his party on some desolate part
of the coast if he persisted in waiting for the boat
from Sydney ; that firmly believing he would put his
threats into execution, he with some difficulty made
himself heard by the people in the Salamander’s
boat, who returned and took him and his party in;
that going down into the cabin, just before this de-
ponent left the ship, he perceived the surgeon
(Blackburn) and the second mate (Gibson) filling
several cartridges with powder, which he supposed
were intended to be made use of in case any boat
should attempt to come on board them, the master

Is Backache Wearing You Out?
"Every Picture
Tells a Story”
DOES any little exertion leave you tired and
worn? Do you feel weak, nervous, “all un-
strung?” Do you suffer daily backache,
dizziness, and sick headache? You shouldn’t! Too
many folks drag along day in and day out, thus
handicapped. And too often they overlook the kidneys
which are likely at fault. Weak kidneys cause many
queer aches, pains and kidney irregularities. But, if
taken in time, kidney ills are usually easily corrected.
Neglected, even a slight kidney weakness may turn
into gravel, dropsy, or fatal kidney disease. Don’t
wait! You owe it to yourself to get well and to stay
well. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills! Doan’s
have brought thousands of weak, tired, discouraged
people back to health. Sydney folks tell the story.
Ask your neighbor!
TWO SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Robert Larcombe, monumental mason, Lidcombe, Sydney, says: “Off
and on for years I suffered from backache and kidney trouble. I would go to
bed feeling fairly well, but on rising in the morning my back would ache ter-
ribly. The pains were sharp and shooting, and centred just above the kidneys.
I was advised to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Rills, a nd I sent for some at
once. After using the first couple of bottles I felt better, and five bottles com-
pletely cured me. I can recommend Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to all who
suffer with their kidneys, and feel sure they will derive benefit from them.’’
Seven years later, Mr. Larcombe says: “It is over seven years since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me of kidney trouble, and I have had no return of
the complaint all that time.”

having repeatedly sworn that no boat should board
them ; that at the time this deponent left the Reso-
lution she was eight miles without the Heads of the
harbor. And further this deponent sayeth not.
On the 21st Captain Collins received this
additional testimony regarding the ill con-
duct of the master of the Resolution:—
Serjeant David Jones, of 'the New South Wales
Corps, personally appeared before me and made
oath that on Sunday morning, the 9th of this instant
month of November, he was sent on board the Reso-
lution (John Locke, master), then at anchor just
above the South Head of this harbor, with a message
from the Lieutenant-Governor, which message was to
inform the master that he was about to quit the
port without having received a certificate of the
number of persons he was permitted to receive on
board belonging to the colony, and that he was not
to take any person away without the Lieutenant-
Governor’s permission; that this message being de-
livered to this master, he replied to this deponent
that he did not think he had any business with a
certificate ; that on telling the master he was ordered
to search for a woman of the name of Morgan, the
master said she was not there —he knew nothing
about her; that having searched for the space of
four hours, during which time she could not be
found in this ship, this deponent went on board the
Salamander to search that ship, and while he was*
there he perceived the Resolution getting under
way, though he had communicated to the master the
necessity there was for his waiting until he heard
further from the Lieutenant-Governor.
* * ■* *
Sergeant David Jones’s affidavit is the very
last that was ever heard in New South Wales
of the elusive, fascinating, and, it is to be
feared, somewhat unscrupulous Mistress
Dorothy Morgan, until this moment. The in-
formation here set out may nevertheless be
relied upon, though it is a little late to be of
any use to those who would have most re-
joiced in its possession.
She has been alluded to as “Mistress” be-
cause of her undoubted right to such title.
Since the day when lie had made her
acquaintance in the True Blue she had been
John Locke’s mistress, although Surgeon
Blackburn had very good reason for suppos-
ing that she regarded Itim as her lover.
When the time came for the Resolution to
take her departure from Sydney—she was
going for a .cruise in the southern whale
fisheries —Captain Locke saw no good reason
why he should deprive himself of the comfort
of Dolly’s society. He had grown used to it,
and had come to regard the lady as almost
a necessity. It would be dull and lonely in
the cold Southern Ocean, and sometimes,
when at sea, he had found himself so bored
by the company of his mates and the surgeon
that it had only been with the utmost diffi-
culty that he had refrained from belting
one or more of them over the head with a
belaying-pin or a handspike. So he re-
solved to take her with him. Mistress Mor-
gan welcomed the idea with enthusiasm,
though had she realised his intention of
putting her on shore in any convenient place,
so soon as he should have grown tired of her,
it is doubtful whether she would have been
quite so keen about absconding in the
Resolution as she was.
There would undoubtedly be difficulties in
the way of accomplishing the pleasant design.
But being a person of resource, Captain
Locke was in no way disturbed by them. He
determined to seek the help of the surgeon
in arranging the lady’s escape from Port
Jackson. As to the male convicts whom he
was taking away, to assist in the whaling,
he would pick them up easily enough at some
point on the coast, just far enough away
from Sydney to be out of sight of the signal-
station on South Head. That would be
simple. It was not quite so simple to remove
a female.
“Dear,” cooed Dorothy to the infatuated
young doctor, “dear, you must —oh, you
must —help to get me out of this horrid
place. It doesn’t matter that I have to
endure that —that bear’s caresses for a
little time, does it? ’Tis our only way.
A.nd when we cgn do so safely we will leave
him and slip away together. Together, dar-
ling—for always.”
So Mr. Blackburn, being equipped with
a somewhat superior quality of brains to
those of his commander, had set them to
work and devised a plan. He told it to
Captain Locke as they sat drinking in the
True Blue a day or two before the ship
was to drop down the harbor from Sydney
Cove to await her final clearance and a
' favorable wind at the Heads.
“ ’Tis the best I can think of, sir,” he
said, “and ’tis not so risky as it might
appear. If she can be got aboard in the
Cove I’ll have the means at hand to hide
her until all their searching is over.”
“And what the H —l will ye devise? ’Tis
a pretty thorough fashion of search they go
in for here. Jacob Toll, the master of the
brig Christian Brothers, told me at the Cape
that they’d closed every hole a-leading to
the ’tween-decks, and smoked out six pris’-
ners he’d stowed away in a space he’d kept
clear below the cargo. It cost him, in fines,
all the money he’d been paid in England
to smuggle the rascals away. That’s why
I’m not picking up the fellies I’ve shipped
for th’ whalin’ until we’re clear o’ Port
Jackson an’ out o’ their reach. Ye’ll have
to put her somewhere where that can’t
happen to her, ye young , or I’ll
keel-haul ye when we get to sea.”
Mr. Blackburn laughed—a little uneasily.
“Never fear, Captain—l’ve thought of a
dodge that’ll circumvent that.”
“What is it—-blast y’r hide?”
“ ’Tis this, sir. As you know—and as
many amongst the principal people in the
Settlement are aware—l’ve been a-colleeting
kangaroo-skins to take home with me. I’ve
got about a hundred of them. I’ll apply
to the Commissary for a large packing-case
out of the Stores —the sort they use to
bring out the clothing for the convicts.
We’ll have the case all labelled at the
Stores, and take care to spread it about
what’s in it. Make the news everywhere
known what I’m doing. I know the Provost-
Marshal pretty well, and will get him to
come down and assist me with his advice
about their proper packing. He’s one of
those fellows who delight in giving advice
about everything whether he knows any-
thing about it or not.”
“Well,, what th’ —— h —l has that got
to do with th’ business of hiding Dolly in
the Resolution?”
“Don’t ye see, sir? As soon as she’s
aboard we’ll take the skins out of the case
and put her in it—with food and drink, of
course—and leave it on the quarter-deck
where non;} of the soldiers sent to search
can fail to see it. There’ll be a hole or
two bored in it for air, and she’ll be quite
comfortable with a mattress to lie upon.
Those cases are nigh as big as a house. You
know them, sir—we had some in the cargo
on the outward voyage. That’s the plan,
sir.”
‘-‘Well, d —n your eyes and limbs, ye
sawbones, if aught goes wrong ve know what
to expect. I’ll flog ye first and then keel-
haul ye till ye drown. Well, see about the
business, blast ye. I’ll look after getting
the wench aboard the night before we drop
down the stream.”
With this amiable acceptance of the sur-
geon s plan, Captain Locke rose and went
out, leaving Mr. Blackburn to settle the
score.
As we know from the affidavits of Ser-
geants Day and Jones, Mr. Blackburn’s in-
genious plan succeeded admirably. Not less
successful was Captain Locke’s little scheme
for shipping his extra hands.
When the Resolution was safely rid of
Sergeant Day and his three soldiers, she
stood straight out to sea until she was out
of sight of land. Then she tacked and ran
back towards Btoken Bay. Again she went
about and came down the coast, heaving-to
several times, and at dusk was off the south-
ern end of Cabbage-tree Beach, as they used
to call the ocean front at Manly. Here she
set a boat ashore into the little bay round by
the Fairy Bower, and picked up some of the
people she sought—the others came aboard
from a fishing expedition that had been
spending the Sunday somewhere off Blue
T ish. These things accomplished, she stood
away into the night, and was lost to New
South Wales. And then the appalling
treachery of Mistress Dorothy Morgan broke
Mr. Blackburn’s foolish heart before it cost
him his life.
lie was seated in the cabin after supper
with that deceptive lady, and, being alone
with her, sought to express some measure
of that tender passion with which lie re-
garded her worthless personality.
<( “Lolly, dearest,” he murmured softly,
come, give me a sweet kiss. ’Tis to your
faithful Tom you owe this deliverance from
bondage at Botany Bay.” (All Australia
was Botany Bay then.) “Will ye not
reward me? Come, my own darling.”
Mistress Morgan looked round cautiously
towards the captain's cabin.
“Where is he?” she whispered.
“He’s on deck, having a row with Mr.
Gibson. ’Tis quite safe.”
She said nothing, but smiled at him—as
he thought—tenderly. So emboldened was
he by her manner that he rose to his feet,
picked her up in his arms and smothered
her face with hot kisses.
She struck him on the cheek suddenly and
began to scream.
“Oh, oh—help! Help! For the love o’
God, help! Oh, Captain Locke —where are
you? Come quickly—save me from this
monster. Oh my God, help !”
The outraged creature had seen the cap-
tain’s face at the open skylight overhead.
There was a bellow from the poop, a sound
of heavy sea-boots pounding the deck, a roar
at the door leading to the quarter-deck, the
sudden rush of a pea-jacketed figure of great
burliness, and Surgeon Blackburn received
a crashing blow in the face from a fist like
a leg of mutton, that broke his jaw and
stretched him senseless upon the deck. When
he came to it was to find that most of his
ribs had been broken also.
In the forenoon of Monday, the Resolution
lay, hove-to, off the barren lump of rock that
is known as Montague Island. Presently an
inert form was lowered over the side into a
boat, and, as its crew pulled away towards
the lee of the island, a woman’s shrill laugh-
ter rippled across the waters. Also, there
came the bellow of an infuriated bull.
“Rot there, ye ! I’ll teach ye to
poach on John Locke’s presarves.”
Twenty years later Captain Eber Bunker,
voyaging from Hobart Town to Sydney’
landed on the island. In the report of his
voyage which he furnished to Governor Mac-
quarie, the worthy seaman—whose spelling
was not the least original thing about him—
wrote this passage :
Wee went ashoar, itt been a carni, and here was
a skilliton of a man thatte must have lay their many
veres. The jaw-bone, which I took for a reliek, was
broak, and so was ye ribbes many of them. ] ha\e
litel dowt ’tis ye reemaynes of some poore man who
was marouned their an dyed after greavous treat-
ment at ye hands of some person.
But Mistress Morgan, the Resolution, Cap-
tain John Locke and Mr. Blackburn, the
surgeon, had long been forgotten in Sydney
by 1814.
J. H. M. ABBOTT.
Child Song of the Moon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s the moon-lady!
Lift a pink finger !
Silver and shady
The little leaves linger
To make her a bonnet
With curly frills on it.
Lift a pink finger!
There’s the moon-lady!
Wave hands to the lady!
Up ever so high
From tree places shady
She climbs to the sky.
As round as an apple
She glides in the dapple,
Where clouds ever so high
Wave hands to the lady.
Yellow as butter—
Blow her three kisses!—-
She makes a bright flutter.
See the star misses
All merrily glancing
Like dewdrops set dancing
By clopdy moon-kisses
As yellow as butter.
The moon-lady’s going—
Wave her good night!
A cloud shawl comes blowing
< All fluffy and white,
So cool, it’s no wonder
She’s dipping right under.
Wave her good night!
The moon-lady’s going!
