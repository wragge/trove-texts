Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
'63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the ’63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this year’s reasonable price
and in the light of possible
future shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying ’64
now, you gain some 20 to
30 cents a bottle each year.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been ’54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

Before too long, Australia's one and only Van
Gogh will be hanging in the new gallery of
the Victorian Arts Centre now being built in
Melbourne. You’ll enjoy going there it will
be a very pleasant place to look at pictures.
And Alcoa aluminium in a new kind of roof
will help make it that way. It will play an
important part in the control of interior
temperatures—keeping things bright and
dry and cool.
The designer of the Victorian Arts Centre has
taken advantage of the characteristics of
Alcoa aluminium particularly its superior
nght finish in a patented process of sun
control. Bright Alcoa aluminium sheeting is
Pierced in a pattern of small slits, and the
8 eet expanded in such a way that the slits
form three-dimensional apertures. The expan-
ded sheet is vacuum-sealed between two
panels of acrylic, and the panels are formed
into a series of curved rooflights. This forms a
screen of tiny apertures which admit desirable
light, reflect intense beams of direct sunlight
and keep out rain. Very ingenious. And the
light which filters through the screen is evenly
pleasingly diffused throughout the building.
Yes, Alcoa aluminium will help present Aus-
tralia’s only Van Gogh and all the art
treasures from the previous home of the
National Gallery of Victoria in the best
possible light.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
For men only,
and everything so
discreet
IT HAS TO BE admitted that at
last things are being done in Mel-
bourne for the pure beauty of man-
kind. For the first time in memory
there have been showings of the latest
spring suitings for gentlemen. We have
had male models striding aggressively
up and down the catwalk in the
Venetian Room at the Australia, show-
ing exactly what has to be worn at the
Cup Carnival.
What’s more, another “hairpiece”
firm has moved into town. You must
appreciate that wigs are now called
hairpieces and barbers are called
hairstylists. So now we have two
hairpiece giants, “Sirs” and “Garreau
of Paris,” appointing hairstylists all
over the place as their agents. They
both have huge advertising programs
and they are fighting out a battle
hairpiece for hairpiece. One hopes
there is enough bare territory avail-
able to go around.
Mr. Leon Le Grande, of Garreau,
has been arranging cocktail parties at
Menzies. His trick is to fill the room
with luxurious growth, not a bald
spot in sight, and then he announces
in firm, even tones: “Twenty-five per-
cent of the men in this room are bald.
I defy you to pick them.” It is a
tense, even uncomfortable moment. I
had one awkward experience. A young
female looked intensely at my hair-
line for five minutes and one could
see her mouthing the words, “Uh-uh,
you’ve got one on for sure.” I felt
like saying: “Yes and I’ve got serious
doubts about your bra also.”
Mr. Le Grande told us that in the
United States bald men were simply
not being chosen for executive posi-
tions. The hairpiece was as essential
as false teeth. He said famous people
like Bing Crosby, Sean Connery, and
Charlton Heston all had their hair-
pieces.
But the real point of this exercise
is to advise you that here in Mel-
bourne we now have our first male
beauty parlor. It is called The Gentry.
It is not, as you might expect, at the
Paris end of Collins Street. It is, more
sensibly, at the financial end, in the
Royal Insurance Building.
mi . O
ine minute you enter the door you
know this is an all-male domain. I was
going to say that the decor was that
of a fine, old club. Actually it’s not.
The atmosphere is that of a new club
that is trying to prove itself. The carpet
is soft and wall-to-wall. There is a side-
board covered in beer pots and good
pewter, and on the walls there are prints
of 18th-century Venetian scenes. I was
met by Mr. Bruce Young, who has a
barbers’ school and a chain of hair-
stylist establishments. Gentry, he said,
filled a need, and already they had a
great number of executive clients.
I looked around. There were shelves
of the best potions for males, names
like English Leather and Monsieur
Lanvin, their elixirs contained in cedar-
wood boxes. There were six booths,
each utterly private. We entered one.
“You will notice,” he said, “there is
none of the horrid atmosphere here of
the barber’s shop. This room is exactly
like the executive’s own office. You see
no bottles, taps, pots of haircream.”
Yes, things were very discreet. The
sink was utterly hidden. It was in a
black desk. Lift the top, and 10, the
basin was inside. The barber’s chair
wasn’t like a barber’s chair at all. It
was on castors, in black leather, and
to give it a public-service rating you’d
just about have to be Sir Roland Wilson
to score one. Mr. Young pointed out
the comforts. Coffee was served free.
The telephone was always available at
one’s elbow, for outgoing or incoming
calls. Secretarial services were available
and one’s trousers could be taken away
and pressed in the time it took to have
a manicure.
“Precisely what sort of people come
in here?” I said. Mr. Young replied:
“A lot of overseas people. To be truth-
ful, we’re still a little conservative here.
We get the younger executive between
30 and 50. We get Americans, we get
Japanese, we get a lot of graziers, also
“Do you take this man as your hus-
band? the undetectable hairpiece
and false teeth are optional extras!”
TV actors and announcers.” Now as for
services, he said, there was the style
cut, $1.25; the razor cut, special head
treatment, blow wave and such, $2.50;
facial, $2.50; permanent waves, hair
tint, hair straightening and that sort of
thing could be anything up to $6
depending on the immensity of the
task involved. Mr. Young said hair
straightening was one of their biggest
assignments. Frizzy hair was utterly out.
Young men couldn’t bear it, and this
could be quite a task. Hair coloring,
too, required great subtlety. They had
a special American treatment.
“Say an executive is going very grey.
Well, we change the color of his hair
over a long period, say six to eight
weeks. Slowly, step by step, we bring
color back into his hair, and nobody
ever notices the change, except that he
appears to be getting more youthful.
It’s better doing it that way. No em-
barrassment. The same thing, of course,
goes for the man who wants the color
of his hair lightened.
“There are other services here, the
sauna, the vibrator, the sun lamp.”
“What about a massage?” I said.
“For God’s sake don’t ever mention
that word,” said Mr. Young, “or people
will think we do frightful things like
they do in Sydney. Now what are you
going to have? I would suggest a facial
and a manicure. Marvellously relaxing.
Takes away that flabbiness under the
chin and tightens the face muscles. Our
girls can stop the ravages of time.”
How could a man resist ravage-
stopping like that? I went into another
booth and there was waiting a pretty
young lady, Miss Valda. She said take
off my coat and tie and she placed
me in a lie-back seat that went almost
horizontal. Then another lady came,
wheeled up a tray full of instruments,
and looking critical she said: “You
have very dry cuticles.”
It’s pretty disturbing when you
learn you have dry cuticles. Miss Valda
had very soft hands. She started gentle
circular motions around the cheeks,
under the chin, across the forehead. She
started with a cleansing cream. Then
with an astringent to tighten up the
muscles and at stage three she applied
placenta jelly. “This must be massaged
deep,” she said. “This is to tone up
your skin.” Next, to continue the pro-
cess of youth embalming, she brought
on an electrical gadget which gave
electrical shocks to the skin. (One
presumes it was the same sort of gad-
get that Madame Xena used at the
Easter market back in the 1880 s:
“Electric shocks. Restore male vitality
for a shilling.”)
But it was very nice, very invigor-
ating. Oh, it was fun. Then Miss
Valda applied the face mask. “This is
cream,” she said. “It dries hard, and
as it tightens gets rid of wrinkles.”
There was more facial treatment,
and finally the sun lamp.
After one hour ten minutes, face
tightened, muscles unflabbed, time un-
ravaged, and with fingernails never so
clean, I stepped into Collins Street.

This is
what happened
to Millie
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
AFTER MILLIE, last year’s plas-
tered lady at the Granville Boys’ High
School art show, come her daughters,
Bertha and Daphne. They take up a
great deal of room at the Darlinghurst
Galleries, Sydney, where the boys are
holding an exhibition of their work.
Daphne is thin, life-size, with mauve
skin, red hair, green eyes, and wears a
bright purple dress and sits on a purple
chair. Bertha’s skin is shocking-pink
and naked and absolutely matches the
bath in which she reclines; Professor
Bernard Smith, Director of the Power
Institute of Fine Arts, who is here to
open the show, examines Bertha’s
generous puce curves closely and says
yes —well—all he can say is she had a
very hot bath indeed.
For the moment, Professor Smith has
his mind on other things. After 25 years
of public speaking he still gets nervous,
he can’t think w'hy he lets himself in for
it, and tonight is no exception. It’s only
just beforehand that he feels jittery. No
such agonies for Alderman John Arm-
strong, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, and
Mr. Hedley Yelland, Director of
Secondary Education. They couldn’t
come to the show. They sent their
apologies. Oh, and the Director-General
of Education, Dr. Harold Wyndham,
was invited. He didn’t reply.
The professor, punctuating away
with horn-rimmed specs, delivers a
lively off-the-cuff tribute to the boys’
work. Artists and sculptors, in green
blazers and grey trousers, sip lemonade
and savor his w'ords. There was a bit of
a students’ demonstration at Professor
Smith’s last opening—the Rodin exhibi-
tion at the N.S.W. Art Gallery—when
he announced the setting up of an
artists’ studio in Paris by the Power
Bequest. Someone wrote to a news-
paper: a flat for artists in Paris! Dis-
gusting. But tonight, except for built-in
sound effects from Ron Newman’s
mobile sculpture—his sister typing,
water running, and other household
noises, Ron’s Mum got sick of him
rushing round with the tape-recorder—
except for these, all is peaceful; amid
applause Professor Smith breathes a
great sigh of relief.
These yearly exhibitions from Gran-
ville High, now as much a part of
Education Week as anything, began out
of a joke. You should see what the
boys are doing out in that rough, toueh
industrial area,” said Art Master Ke
Reinhard three years ago to Mrs. Clun!
of the Clune Gallery, “they’re worth
exhibiting.” And why not? said she So
they were. And now people say oh, yes
Granville High, the art-show boys, not’
oh, you mean that place where all the
factories are? “All the same,” says Art
Master John Seivl, whose own first
one-man show comes on soon, “it’s
marvellous to think the captain of the
First Fifteen goes home after arduous
matches and paints an exquisite, intri-
cate, decorative picture of a peacock
and several of his star footballers are
producing aesthetically advanced wav.
out stuff.”
They’re all here, standing by their
photographs stuck near their work,
The Dover Heights Girls’ High School
is coming on Thursday. Miss Ann
Cross, their mistress, says they’re very
excited. She thinks they’re coming to
look at the boys’ photographs as much
as anything.
Bertha smiles ambiguously from her
tub, the by-product of a Merrylands
backyard, and one of the boys down
the room slips his telephone number
to a prospective buyer. No one’s
actually allowed to buy tonight. The
school doesn’t want the boys to get
too big for their boots. Anyway, com-
mercial profit isn’t the object.
By the way, someone asks, whatever
happened to Millie? You know, now
Third formers at Granville Boys’ High
School, Dennis Hill, Norman Bailey,
and Robin Grosse, sculpting Daphne
and Bertha
we’ve got her two daughters here and
all that. Well, it’s like this: last year
a man wanted to buy her, but the
school was proud of Millie and said
no. Millie should live at Granville and
be appreciated by all. And so she sat
for some time in the main building,
and with a thousand boys coming
through daily the few marks she
gathered weren’t all that bad.
However, to make sure she would
last, they moved her to the safest place
of all, the art department. They found
Millie here one morning, bashed to
pieces. And they scraped her up and
tipped her into the garbage can.
That is what happened to Millie

PETER SAMUEL WRITES ON
ECONOMY
The Budget that
was two years
too late
MR. McMAHON must be pretty happy
that the critics of his Budget don’t go
much beyond the hackneyed retort that
it is “uninspiring.” For that is hardly
a substantial criticism. Most of us are
occasionally “inspired” by a sunset, a
football match, oratory, or architecture,
but I find it hard to conceive of being
similarly moved by the announcement
of a Government’s annual accounting
exercise.
I knock my fellow Budget critics
because really our task this year is very
easy. When we say the Budget is dull,
we are really saying that the accounts
of a dull Government are dull. Here
we are approaching September, 1967,
faithfully fixed to financing a defence
program conceived prior to September,
1965. That, we might remember, was
the month in which the promoters of
the Peking-Djakarta axis made their
bloody little bid for total power in
Indonesia and lost miserably. With that
loss went the urgent need for this
country to have 100 modern specialised
interceptor planes, 25 of the world’s
most advanced bombers, and half a
dozen electronic-computerised ships
and submarines. But since then there
has developed a need for more foot-
soldiers plus helicopters so that we
can meet our commitments against
wars of insurgency on the Asian
mainland.
And here we are in 1967 with a
classic “anti-Indonesian” defence Bud-
get at a time when the Indonesian
Government is firmly established in the
anti-communist camp. Our Army (cap-
able of putting 4500 combat troops in
the field and providing them with what
they call “teeny-weeny airlines” 20
helicopters) gets an 8.5 percent addi-
tion to its funds, $3O million, or just
about the amount Mr. McEwen’s sugar
farmers get in extra subsidy. The “anti-
Indonesian” Air Force, on the other
hand, gets a whopping 34.4 percent
increase, $96 million extra, and the
“anti-Indonesian” Navy a 15 percent
boost or $3O million more. And our
good friends in Malaysia, being deserted
by the Brits, find that Australia, despite
noises to the contrary, is retrenching,
too reducing defence aid from
$8,036,000 to $6,286,000.
Dull is just too kind a word for the
Treasury-inspired nonsense about
defence in Mr. McMahon’s Budget
speech. Defence is only a heavy balance-
of-payments burden because the
Government, rocklike in collective
intelligence and adaptive capacity, re-
mains committed to buying electronic
toys being manufactured at unknown
but certainly spiralling prices from
foreign factories, when the great and
pressing need is for many more 100
percent Australian-made, Canungra-
trained Diggers. Dull is too polite a
description for the proposition that in
an economy, which expands overall by
an odd $2OOO million each year, we
cannot, “without deep impairment,”
afford to go on increasing defence
expenditure by $2OO million annually.
We aren’t in Lotus-land any more, our
leader tells us, but then at the end of
the month he lets his accountant present
us with a bill which includes not one
tax increase and which, in fact, gives
us some small discounts.
Do they think we, the critics, are dull
when they tell us that by giving the
Post Office a new bank account they
will be able to work managerial and
productivity miracles? This vast organ-
isation is still to be as hamstrung as
ever by the old squabbling troika to
which it is harnessed the Public
Service Board, which sets employment
conditions and supervises staffing, the
Treasury, which tries to pennypinch,
and the Parliament, which exerts pork-
barrel pressures for telecommunication
patronage.
We might point to a rather dulled
sense of humanity in a collection of
men who will not put an extra two
cents on the petrol tax or a cent on
beer in order to maintain the value of
pensions and other social service pay-
ments eroded by inflation, but who give
the Australian National University 2G
per cent (or $4,000,000) more to squan-
der than it squandered last year. (Has
the Universities Commission chairman
—formerly famous as a Treasury penny-
pincher—quietly retired?)
But what could have been duller
than the series of rhetorical questions
with which the Budget speech ended?
Is our workforce growing fast enough?
the Treasurer asks; so we go and look
in his immigration target for a big
bold increase. There isn’t even the
smallest increase. It’s the same dull
figure of 148,000. Is management doing
“the job national greatness demands”?
Not if this Budget is any indication.
Are we mobilising capital and allocat-
ing it properly? Do we have a policy
to control costs? the Treasurer asks.
Not with tariff policy in the control
of one of your colleagues, we can in-
terject. And we can ask him whether
he is encouraging chemical, textile
dairy, and sugar industries to “be effi-
cient.”
But, anti-climactic though it may be
we are forced to end on a kind note’
Within the constraints imposed by a
dull Holt Government, your Budget
Mr. McMahon, is a tidy one. You’ve
stolen the, thunder of economist critics
by an unerringly competent and de-
tailed presentation of the likely econ-
omic impact of your Budget. We can-
not argue convincingly that there is
anything wrong with your assessment
of economic trends and your statement
Mr. McMahon. .. dull is too kind a
word for his Budget
of the economic context in which your
Budget is framed. We may think you
are rather on the cautious side in not
risking a few more pressures on re-
sources by making the Budget about as
expansionary as last year’s turned out
to be. But we cannot honestly argue
that with much conviction. As an
economic exercise your Budget and
its papers with their expanded technical
appendices are most professional.
Your Budget looks from this point
in time to be very well framed to
steer us on the right path to keep clear
of unemployment and lost production
on the one side, and inflation and bal-
ance-of-payments problems on the
other. Your very competence in this
narrow field directs our critical atten-
tions to the Government’s more general
inadequacies.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Birthday present
AUSTRALIA’S best-known expatriate
painter, Sidney Nolan, turned 50 this
year, and he has returned to Sydney
to receive the N.S.W. Art Gallery’s
birthday present to him the largest
retrospective exhibition it has ever held.
It will span 30 years of Nolan’s work,
contain 167 paintings, and has taken
four years to prepare, a task made
easier by the painter himself, as Hal
Missingham, the Gallery’s director,
explained in a welcoming speech:
“Some artists are plain difficult. They
don’t know when they did paintings,
where they are now, or who bought
them. But Sid’s so cunning that he
never lets a painting go without know-
ing who the buyer is, who his mother
and father are, and everything else
about him which helps tremendously
when you’re trying to gather and cata-
logue paintings.”
Amid the tangle of television equip-
ment and well-wishers, Nolan seemed
a slight, insubstantial, and perhaps ner-
vous figure, more schoolmaster than
painter and with none of the noticeable
Australianisms of Drysdale or of his
friend, writer George Johnston, one of
those there to welcome him.
He has no idea of the number of
paintings he has done, making it his
policy to forget the problems of each
painting as he finishes it. “I never
change my mind about a painting. If I
did, I would just be going over and
over the same ground, and not getting
any further. I work on one painting at
a time—some taking ten times longer
than others. I don’t know why . . . it’s
not that they’re more complex, just
that you miss your cues somehow.”
Despite his policy of forgetfulness,
does he own any of his paintings? “Oh,
yes, there are those you become fond
of,” he said, smiling as he momentarily
forgot the circling television camera.
“You keep them . . . under the bed.
Publishing palace
THE AUSTRALIAN end of British
publisher Paul Hamlyn’s empire is
under construction at Dee Why, Syd-
ney, with plans that augur an opulence
new to publishing in this country.
A pagoda-style archway, landscape
gardens, and fountains will be part of
this air-conditioned, computerised
palace for which the British publisher
has budgeted a million dollars. “We’ve
bought five acres at Dee Why with the
idea of building a showplace for books,
as well as a central warehouse. It should
be finished by December,” said Kevin
Weldon, Hamlyn’s managing director
in Australia.
7 hings have moved with some speed
for Mr. Weldon (formerly manager of
Grenville Publishing Company, part of
the K. G. Murray group) since he met
Paul Hamlyn at a cocktail party during
the publisher’s visit to Sydney eight
months ago. “I wasn’t even sure why
I d been invited until Hamlyn phoned
next morning to say he wanted me to
handle things here for him.
“After I’d accepted, he said, ‘Right,
work out what you want. And then
you'll have to come back to London
with me for three months to get a
better idea of the organisation.’ I ex-
plained this wouldn’t be so easy, as I
hadn’t long come back from an over-
seas trip for my previous job, and my
wife would be threatening me with
divorce if I left again. He considered
that for a while, and said, ‘All right,
bring your wife, too.’
“We spent two weeks travelling
through the East and Europe, then six
weeks in London and New York. He
has a branch in Mexico which he wanted
to show me, so we went there, and on
to Los Angeles to look at another com-
pany. He believes in speed.”
He also believes in promotion. A
Hamlyn book is never placed straight
into the bookshops without attendant
publicity, and projects editor Joan
Clibbon is coming here from London
in September, as is Hamlyn himself,
to promote the company’s first titles.
Thirty Australian titles are already
planned, all conforming to the Hamlyn
patter of prestigiously presented books
dealing with “leisure-time activities.”
Except for fiction, this seems to take in
most things, from art to cake decorating,
and while Australian books represent
only one percent of the turnover for
the first year, this is expected to be
increased to ten percent by the third
year. As many as possible will be aimed
at the world market and Hamlyn looks
upon his Australian operation as a base
for future possible expansion to Asian
countries.
“We’re planning a look about Aus-
tralia,’ said Mr. Weldon. “There are
lots on the market already, I know, but
ours will be as well produced but half
the price. That’s why Paul Hamlyn is
successful. He can afford to sell books
more cheaply than anyone else because
he prints five times more than anyone
else. He backs his judgment.”
Once more, slowly
SCIENCE AND ART are taking some
tentative steps toward each other in the
rehearsal rooms of the Australian Ballet
Company this week. The medium is
choreology, or dance notation, a ffiort-
hand-like system of symbols by which
complete ballets can be translated on
to paper step by step.
So far only one person in Australia
can understand choreology 25-year-
old Elphine Allen, a former dancer with
the Royal Ballet who graduated at the
College of Choreology in London in
1963. Originally from Canberra, she
returned to Australia in 1965 with a
book containing all the movements of
Rudolph Nureyev’s ballet “Raymonda.”
Nureyev didn’t have time to come to
Australia to prepare the ballet himself,
so Elphine and choreology came instead.
This week she is clasping a book
containing details of “La Fille Mai
Gardee,” the Australian Ballet’s first
production for its coming season. The
ballet was first danced in 1789 but has
since been forgotten, so Sir Frederick
Ashton rechoreographed it for the
Royal Ballet in 1960. Elphine’s nota-
tions were made during a series of
rehearsals by the Royal Ballet, and she
is using them to teach the ballet to the
Australian dancers.
Choreology may be exact, but it is
also laborious. “I can naturally watch
only one dancer at a time in fact only
one foot .or leg at a time. And unlike
shorthand, with which you can listen
and write at once, you miss movements
as you write and have to add them
at a later rehearsal.”

AS I SEE IT
The Left-wing
victory out
of defeat
By ALAN REID
PRIME MINISTER HOLT last week
in Parliament said there was not
much difference between the ALP Viet-
nam policy decided in Adelaide and the
proposal of university students to collect
funds for the National Liberation Front.
There were cries of protest. Labor
spokesmen pointed out that though the
students were from Labor clubs these
clubs had no connection with the Labor
Party and that Labor disapproved of
what students were doing.
But it is difficult to see how Labor is
going to meet the charge implicit in
Holt’s comment that Labor’s Adelaide
decision represents assistance to the
NLF, political wing of the Viet Cong
against which Australians are fighting in
Vietnam.
If you analyse the Adelaide ALP
decision it is of far more assistance to
the Viet Cong and the NLF than a few
students’ scanty financial contributions,
particularly if a Labor Government is
elected to power in Australia. It is
undoubtedly designed to help secure
peace in war-torn Vietnam.
But equally as clearly, if the condi-
tions Labor lays down as the price of
keeping Australian troops in Vietnam
were accepted by the U.S., it would be
a peace that would put the NLF in the
dominant position.
Briefly the Adelaide decision was
that a future Labor Government would
ask Australia’s allies (the United States
is the one aimed at) to fulfil three con-
ditions or Australian troops would be
withdrawn. The first condition is to
cease bombing North Vietnam.
The argument in this one is that if
bombing ceased it might be possible
to persuade North Vietnam to the
negotiation table. The United States
has said that it is prepared to cease the
bombing once North Vietnam has indi-
cated any willingness to talk about
negotiation, but North Vietnam has
shown no sign. Still the argument is a
respectable one, though the ALP has
left no loophole. The bombing is to
cease permanently whether or not North
Vietnam agrees to appear at the nego-
tiation table.
The second condition is that the
NLF be recognised as a principal party
to negotiations.
At the Adelaide conference Mr. W. R.
Colbourne, N.S.W. Secretary, angrily
charged that the rest of the motion was
wrapping designed to get the passage
of this condition.
Colbourne said the motion was
designed to get support for the proposi-
tion that the NLF was the force fight-
ing in South Vietnam that it was
not North Vietnam, China, and com-
munist countries that were keeping the
fighting going. He paused challengingly
to allow anyone to express a contrary
opinion. There was silence.
After his recent visit to South Viet-
nam the Deputy Labor Leader, Mr.
Lance Barnard, had said publicly on his
return to Australia that it was clear
there was invasion of South Vietnam
from the north.
The third condition is that operations
in South Vietnam be transformed into
holding operations . and provide
sanctuary for anyone seeking it.
Without in any way questioning the
genuineness of the desire of those who
voted for these conditions to secure
peace in South Vietnam, it is clear
that this can only strengthen immeasur-
ably the hands of both the Viet Cong
and North Vietnam.
North Vietnam is not being invaded.
It is being bombed, but there are no
ground troops there. There are sections
of South Vietnam that are being held
by North Vietnamese and the NLF.
I have no military knowledge what-
soever, but common sense suggests that
if you are holding only what you have
and are committed to not seeking to
regain what you have lost you are
conceding the part held by your enemies
permanently and for all time. What the
ALP policy tells the United States, the
South Vietnamese, and Australia’s other
allies to do is acknowledge themselves
as defeated outside the areas they now
specifically hold, but to continue to
hold indefinitely enclaves in South Viet-
nam (which they must do if they are
going to “provide sanctuary for anyone
seeking it”).
As I see it, the conference merely
confirmed the Calwell doctrine that a
Labor Government would withdraw
Australian troops now in Vietnam but
tried to give it a respectable gloss by
setting out an ultimatum to the United
States that boiled down to:
The United States must acknowledge
defeat in South Vietnam.
It must no longer try to win.
It must acknowledge the NLF as the
legitimate South Vietnam Government
in those areas which the allies did not
actually have troops stationed.
A thing that has puzzled me is that
this resolution was depicted as a Left-
wing defeat merely because conference
rejected a Western Australian resolution
to which the six W.A. delegates were
committed, and which was moved
Mr. F. E. (“Joe”) Chamberlain. 7
The facts are these: originally the
Left Wing agreed to go along with the
recommendation of the Federal ALP
Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee
This opposed continuance of the war
in Vietnam and Australian participation
in it, but in the hope of securing elec-
toral advantage left magnificently vague
the whole issue of what would happen
about Australian troops serving there if
a Labor Government was returned.
But the Left-wing leaders could not
hold their own followers. The Left-
wingers either did not trust the new
Labor leader, Mr. Gough Whitlam, or
felt the issue too important to worry
about electoral considerations. They
wanted the Parliamentary Labor Party,
which would provide the Ministers if
a Labor Government came to power
tied right down on this issue, whatever
might be the electoral consequences to
Labor’s parliamentary wing.
Tasmanian and South Australian
delegates got together and they com-
posed a draft policy. They secured
Victoria’s support. Even though Dr.
Jim Cairns, MHR for Yarra and a
Victorian delegate, was committed to
supporting the committee’s recommen-
dations (Colbourne reproached him for
his “flexibility” and his later switch
during the public debate), Cairns was
persuaded to draft the policy in a
form that would be acceptable to all
those wanting a firm “tie the parlia-
mentarians down” line. A master con-
ference strategist, Chamberlain sug-
gested that they put up their own W.A.
resolution (which also called for the
withdrawal of Australian troops from
Vietnam), to which they were com-
mitted, have it defeated, and then vote
for the “tie the parliamentarians down”
policy. This was the course W.A. ulti-
mately followed.
South Australian Premier Don Dun-
stan then nearly wrecked things.
Though an S.A. delegate to the confer-
ence, he had been absent for a while on
official duties. When he got back, he
found his co-delegates committed to
“tie the parliamentarians down.”
He knew Whitlam was terrified that
endorsement of the proposed policy
once its implications were realised
would wreck Labor’s electoral prospects
at the next elections. So he opposed the
policy. For a while he swung two dele-
gates to his side and S.A. deadlocked
three all. But finally one of the two
apostates was talked back into ortho-
doxy and Dunstan was overridden.
Because Chamberlain’s W.A. motion
(which he was committed by W.A. to
moving) was defeated, this was inter-
preted as a Left-wing defeat. But it was
Whitlam and the Right Wing that suf-
fered the defeat, and paved the way for
Holt’s thrust this week that there was
little difference in principle between
what the university students were doing
to assist the NLF and what came out of
the Adelaide conference.


AUSTRALIA
Australia's running, jumping, and
standing still defence policy
AUSTRALIA IS A KIND of stop-
hoppity-stop country. We can go on
for years not changing our ways. Then
we can move very quickly . . . hop,
hop, hop, like a kangaroo. Then stop:
where are we Hopping to now?
This mixture of conservatism,
adaptability, and sudden doubt has been
superbly dramatised in what goes by
the name of our defence policy. At
the end of the long Menzies era we were
one of the oddities of the “Western”
(viz. prosperous) world because, in
relation to our population, our defence
expenditure was so low. Suddenly, in
proportion to population, we are ahead
of everybody except the United States,
the United Kingdom, and France.
But we are still behind most other
similar countries in what we are actu-
ally putting down on the ground in
the way of military strength. And we
are also behind them in deciding what
our military strength is for.
It is true that we have a combination
of problems that no other “Western”
country of our size has to face. We
have to worry about what China is
up to. We depend more immediately
than others on the American alliance.
We face the problem of the British
pull-out from South-East Asia. And
until recently we faced the opera
bouffe of Soekarno’s “confrontation,”
a kind of problem that we must still
prepare ourselves for.
Our trouble is that our Government
doesn’t seem to have been able to fix
itself up with a policy toward our
armed forces that takes into account
this special combination of problems.
We are now re-equipping our Navy
and Air Force to counter-confront a
Soekarno who has disappeared. But
we haven’t enough Army troops to play
a full part in our American alliance,
or to bolster our friends in South-East
Asia in their uncertainties about the
British pull-out.
The proportionately huge increase
in expenditure on our armed forces
happened because a few years ago
the Americans rightly whinged that we
weren’t spending enough. But the
Government’s decision was mainly to
up expenditure to a point (five per-
cent was the arbitrarily chosen figure)
which would look good as a propor-
tion of Gross National Product.
Each of the three Services was given
its fair share—and off we went on a
kind of drunken sailors’ and airmen’s
spending spree which means that a
huge proportion of our Defence budget
goes out of the country to buy sophisti-
cated equipment that has no relation
to the one war we are fighting, and
the main immediate effect of which is
a deflationary one in an economy that
still shows some sluggishness.
It is true that, in the Menzies era,
money spent on weapons and equip-
ment was so small that foreign
exchange reserves now have to be used
so that we can at least stay where we
are. The same goes for internal spend-
ing on base installations and service
housing. Between them these two con-
siderations mean that half our military
budget goes out on defence “capital.”
But even so it seems crazy that, in
a situation in which the provision of
Army troops seems our immediate con-
cern, we have so few troops to put on
the ground.
The NATO countries have between
4000 and 8000 soldiers per million of
their population (with the exception of
Canada, which has concentrated on a
huge air force). Most of the Com-
munist nations have more than 10,000
soldiers per million population. Neutral
Sweden and Switzerland have around
6000. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thai-
land rate 3000 to 4000. But Australia
has only 2900. And there are no im-
mediate plans to increase this figure.
Only New Zealand, Japan, India,
and the Philippines have proportion-
ately fewer soldiers than we do.
Holland, a NATO country of similar
population to ours has an army of
85,000 (to our 41,000). Sweden, with
two-thirds our population, has 50,000
and a huge trained reserve. And of
the eight battalions that make up our
Army, only half can provide service
overseas at any one time, that is to say,
about 5000 combat troops.
There is very little sign that the
Government will find new policies be-
tween now and the next Budget, even
though it has to plan for a South-East
Asia without the British and also has
to pick up another three year’s defence
planning.
For years its catchphrase has been
“forward defence.” This meant prim-
arily providing more soldiers. The
Army now has plans for a three-
division 150,000 man force by the mid-
-19705, a force which would allow us
to deploy a full division overseas at any
one time. This would allow us, for
example, to have a full brigade in
Malaysia, replacing the British part of
the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve,
plus three times the present Task
Force we have in Vietnam.
But, ironically, just at the time when
we look as though we might be on the
verge of actually carrying out a “for-
ward defence” policy, there has been
some back-pedalling on the whole con-
cept of “forward defence.” Within
policy making departments in Can-
berra there is now something of an
upsurge in isolationist thinking. The
term “Fortress Australia” is being
Stop ... hop pity ... stop


thrown around. The logic of this mili-
tary isolationism is partly defeatism
about the outcome in Vietnam and a
generalised conclusion that “wars of
this sort” cannot be won; partly the
feeling that the United States is going
to be increasingly reluctant to maintain
commitments in Asia; partly intense
scepticism about the practical useful-
ness of SEATO, ASEAN, ASPAC, and
other regional organisations; and partly
a leftover colonialist collapse of nerve
in commitment to South-East Asia.
Government spokesmen talk a lot
about Australia’s role in the Asian
region. But they now seem to be pre-
pared to shut up rather than put up.
After the brief liberations of the early
Holt period, when the Prime Minister
showed his face all over the peripheries
of South-East and East Asia, they now
seem to be dreaming of an Australia
that is somehow just like Western
Europe.
The Treasury line is that defence
can be framed in West European terms.
If it’s good enough for Holland or
Norway to spend five percent of their
GNP on defence, and feel secure, then
all we have to do is to do a bit of
statistical magic and meet their figures.
That is almost exactly what the
Treasurer said in the Budget. Behind
the Treasury line is the belief that
just as the Western Europeans get sup-
port for their defence system without
committing troops to South-East Asia,
so could we.
For the Treasury people, our support
of American activity on the Asian
External Affairs Minister Hasluck ...
wilting
mainland is ephemeral, something
which will pass with the end of the
Vietnam conflict. Not as real as filling
in forms and worrying about the
Auditor-General. They also have a con-
servative view of our economic capacity
to support a continued defence build-
up, as evidenced in the irritated asser-
tion in the Budget speech: “Plainly we
cannot continue for long to meet any-
thing like the rate of increase (of
defence spending) of recent years
without deep impairment of the
economy.”
Our present five percent of GNP
is spoken of as the absolute maximum
proportion of economic resources which
defence should take, just as there is
held to be something vitally important
in keeping taxation below 25 percent
of National Income. If these Treasury
tenets are not effectively challenged our
forward defence policy and our in-
volvement in Asia will remain empty
phrases and the isolationists will come
to dominate defence planning.
And not only defence planning.
There are already signs that the
External Affairs Department is wilting
under its new challenges. To play an
independent, active, and brotherly role
among our neighbors in South-East
Asia is a challenge that the Depart-
ment is slow to meet. It has bored the
Indonesians by coming in with too little
economic aid too late. It is now per-
haps affronting the Singaporean and
Malaysian Governments by showing no
immediate initiative in face of the
British pull-out —except to cut military
aid. It is also slow to respond to the
initiatives of a Japan that is beginning
to resume a diplomatic interest in
Asia.
Is Australia again to slip back into
the dream that it is nothing more
than a province of Western Europe?
A nation owed its prosperity by the
world, and not required to act as a
nation in its own right?
Parliament
Funds to the VC
THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED
boldly in Parliament last week to the
DLP move for action against protest-
ers seeking to send money to the Viet
Cong. The Prime Minister arranged a
“Dorothy Dix” question in the House
of Representatives so that he could
make a statement before Senator Mc-
Manus could speak to his “urgency
motion” on the matter.
Adeptly, he explained the Govern-
ment’s inaction to date in terms of its
desire “not to magnify this matter out
of proportion,” conceding, as every
other speaker did, that only a tiny
minority of students was involved.
He was concerned to assure our
soldiers in Vietnam that “they have
the full backing of the Government
and, I believe, the overwhelming
majority of the Australian people.” He
promised that the Government would
do “everything in its power” to stop
the Aid-the-NLF committees.
It is understood that banks were
immediately asked to block any
attempts to transfer money which
might be destined for the Viet Cong.
Other exchange control measures were
being investigated.
The Attorney-General was being
asked to examine the legal aspects and
have a submission ready for considera-
tion by Cabinet the next week. Within
the department there was a lot of
understandable reluctance to recom-
mend the application of the “treachery”
section (24AA) of the Crimes Act be-
cause of the .harsh sentence on con-
viction: life imprisonment.
There were two alternative courses
under consideration at the time we
went to press. One is to apply section
7A, which refers to incitement to com-
mit an offence and carries a penalty of
$2OO or imprisonment for 12 months
Application of this section would stili
require the proclamation of the Viet
Cong under section 24AA. The alter-
native being considered is some more
suitable legislation with more flexible
penalties.
The Prime Minister also spoke of an
organised campaign of psychological
warfare against the Government’s
policies in Vietnam. The Australian
Security Intelligence organisation is
being asked to gather information for
a report which the Attorney-General
will make to Cabinet on this broader
subject. Ironically, as the Prime
Minister spoke inside, the House, the
Reverend Alan Walker was telling a
televised protest meeting on the '.awns
outside the Parliament of a “world
Christian consensus” against the war in
Vietnam.
“Having recently returned from
America, I am convinced that dissent
has become so strong in America that
within 12 months it could force
America to disengage its forces in Viet-
nam,” he said.
Mr. Holt’s third and unspoken rea-
son for raising the matter is that he
can embarrass the Labor Party with it.
The ALP caucus wisely decided to dis-
sociate itself from the Viet Cong fund
raising committees and said it “dis-
agreed” with them, but there was a
Senator McManus. . . urgency
half-hearted note about the statement.
DLP Senators were able to list the
number of occasions on which promin-
ent members of the Labor Party had
spoken at meetings of the various
Labor clubs with which they claimed
no association.
Members of the Government are also
able to point to the similarity of views
between the ALP and the VC fund-
raisers. Labor Party men have spoken
so eloquently and often of the evil role
our forces are playing in Vietnam and
have downplayed so greatly the nastier
characteristics of the Viet Cong that
there is a moral and logical connection
between their policy and the fund-
raisers’ action.


CONSERVATION WEEK
ALP and Vietnam
New-worse policy
/\m >
fhPi(j£NOO£
Too
briber)
FIKE !
THE LABOR PARTY IS in as much
trouble as ever over its foreign policy.
This became quite clear in the foreign
affairs debate in Parliament last week.
Mr. Whitlam, following the Ade-
laide Federal Conference, is as firmly
bound to a policy of capitulation in
Vietnam as the hapless Mr. Calwell.
In fact, the new policy may be a
greater electoral liability than the old
one. It was at least simple. It said:
we are getting out.
The new one as developed by Mr.
Whitlam and his deputy, Mr. Barnard,
is more complicated and more de-
manding than Mr. Calwell’s. First it
demands that the allies unilaterally
cease bombing operations in North
Vietnam, foregoing the protection
gained by harassing the infiltration of
supplies and soldiers from the north,
and granting the northern regime
privileged sanctuary.
Second, that despite the increased
dependence and subordination of
Communist forces in the south to
Hanoi, their claim to an indigenous,
autonomous character is to be recog-
nised, and their political front organi-
sation negotiated with.
Third, the defence of populated
areas is to be abandoned “to avoid
the involvement of civilians in the
war.” Labor says “objectionable
materials of war” are not to be used
—a prescription capable of indefinite
extension, conceivably leaving the
Americans with nothing more to drop
from their bombers than canisters of
propaganda pamphlets.
Were the Vietnamese or Americans
not to see the wisdom of this
“de-escalation,” an Australian Labor
Government would “consider it had
no alternative other than to withdraw
our armed forces.”
Despite this, both Mr. Whitlam and
Mr. Barnard make it clear they be-
lieve that the Americans have a strong
moral responsibility to ensure that
anti-Communist Vietnamese are not
persecuted by the new Communist
government. “An amnesty and asylum,”
Mr. Whitlam said, “will need an
American presence military, eco-
nomic, and political.”
Mr. Barnard spelt it out at great
length: “It is not reasonable at this
stage to contemplate immediate with-
drawal of American forces from Viet-
nam. The Americans have made a
commitment and have undertaken
serious responsibilities. Perhaps be-
tween five million and seven million
people in South Vietnam have a vital
interest in the American presence and
continued American support.”
The Labor Party is going to have
obvious difficulty in explaining just
how these people can be protected if
the allied forces are to retreat into
isolated military bases defended only
by “unobjectionable” weapons of war.
Victoria
DLP “second stage"
SINCE THE LABOR SPLIT of 1955
the Democratic Labor Party has
worked hard to make public contrast
between its own political unity and
the internal divisions and faction
fights in the ALP. Some years ago
there was a rumpus, stirred up by
former parliamentarians Bourke and
Keon, about the influence of the
National Civic Council on the DLP’s
membership and policies, but the
appearance of unity was quickly re-
established and harmony restored.
In recent months there have been
signs of mounting tension beneath the
skin. A significant eruption occurred at
this month’s annual conference of the
Victorian DLP. At the closed Sunday
morning session the Caulfield branch
moved this resolution:
“The Conference declares that the
DLP in its 12 years of service to
this nation has fulfilled the first stage
of its historic task by preventing the
establishment of a pro-Communist
Government in Australia. And that
this conference directs the Central
Executive to streamline its ideology,
its social, economic, foreign, and cul-
tural policies, and its organisation, with
a view to initiating the second stage
of its mission, that of winning the
Government of this country.”
According to one delegate: “Then,
a real Donnybrook broke out. Apart
from a bit of a skirmish over the
executive’s report on the Corio by-
election, the conference had been going
along very smoothly. But this motion
really split the boys down the middle.”
Most of the delegates saw the motion
as a challenge to the prevailing DLP
orthodoxy that the Party should per-
sist in keeping the ALP out of office
but remain ready to do a deal with
the ALP, and even rejoin it, when that
Party finally destroys its Left-wing
faction and adopts an anti-Communist
and pro-American foreign policy.
But there is now a strong faction in
the DLP which has lost interest in the
possibility of an eventual merger with
the ALP and wants the DLP to for-
get Whitlam and Barnard and go all
out for the “second stage” objective
of “winning the Government of this
country.” Proponents of this policy are
known as the “Third Party men.”
Support for the Third Party policy
in Victoria comes largely from the
younger members who joined the DLP
after the split and regard the ALP
as out of date and reactionary, from
the strong Western District branches
which believe that they will shortly be
able to win seats in the State Parlia-
ment, from New Australians who be-
lieve that the ALP is basically hostile
to Continental migrants, and from
middle-class members who would like
the DLP to shed the title “Labor.”
The vote on the “two stages” motion
showed their combined strength. After
the fierce debate it was carried 78 to
59. According to one source, a DLP
leader voted for the motion on the
voices, but with some signs of reluc-
tance voted against it when a division
was called.
Most of the permanent officials of
the Party, and those members who are
influenced by the National Civic Coun-
cil of Mr. Santamaria, were opposed
to the motion and made their oppo-
sition loud and clear. They believe that
the motion is unrealistic and that the
DLP can never hope to increase its
vote much beyond present figures. The
Young Turks and their country and
New Australian allies believe that the
DLP has a big future if it can get rid

miles of the Murray.
The recent announcement by the
River Murray Commission that the
Chowilla Dam project has been de-
ferred was a severe blow to plans for
South Australian development. The
Premier described the Commissions’
decision as “ominous.”
The State-wide disappointment even
provoked suggestions that the scheme
may have been sabotaged by Victorian
interests.
Sir Henry Bolte replied that such
suspicions were nonsense and claimed
that Victoria was all in favor of the
project if it were technically feasible.
But he added that in the light of the
most recent technical information the
dam was a “hopeless proposition.”
Three problems have forced the
River Murray Commission to defer
further construction work on the
project: cost, salinity, and evapora-
tion. In 1962, when the four Govern-
ments agreed to proceed with the dam
the estimated cost was $2B million. A
couple of years ago it had risen to
million. The Commonwealth Min-
lster for National Development, Mr.
airbairn, has now indicated that
replies to tenders show that the cost
of the dam would be close to $7O mil-
lion. There is no chance of New
South Wales and Victoria putting up
half that amount (under the agree-
ment each Government is to pay a
quarter of the costs).
One of the reasons for the increased
estimates is the necessity to maintain
minimum flows at the Victorian fruit-
growing town of Mildura so that saline
content can be reduced to an acceptable
level for irrigation. Another, and po-
tentially more troublesome saline
problem arises from the nature of the
subterranean basin on which the dam
would rest. Under the Chowilla flood-
plain is a deposit of water, probably
more than 20 million acre feet and as
salty as sea-water. At present this
water seeps into the river without
markedly increasing salinity. Some
hydrologists fear that the pressure
forcing down from the projected Chow-
illa Dam could push this underground
water downstream into the river and
raise salinity to a dangerous level.
Hydrologists now estimate that the
salinity problem could be serious in-
side the dam because of the heavy rate
of evaporation, which is expected to be
much greater than was at first anti-
cipated. Water loss from evaporation in
a dam which would not be very deep
but would be more than 10 times the
acreage of Sydney Harbor would be
extensive over the long, dry summers
in the Chowilla region.
With the other State Governments
losing interest and the Commonwealth
looking hard at the technical problems,
the South Australian Government has
threatened to enforce its legal rights.
The Premier told State Parliament last
week that his Government could force
the other parties to keep to their com-
mitments because legislation for the
erection of the dam and for the sharing
of expenses had already been ratified.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA’S Minister
for Health, Mr. Albert Shard, and the
State’s Director-General of Public
Health, Doctor P. S. Woodruff, spent
ten days in New Zealand recently
examining the school dental nurse sys-
tem the first of its kind in the
world.
A very impressed Mr. Shard said
South Australia would have a scheme
similar to New Zealand’s, and it’s being
established with the help of the New
Zealand Health Department’s division
of dental care.
One of the division’s dental nurse
inspectors has been seconded to Adel-
aide for two and a half years, and two
Adelaide dental instructors have done
some training and observed administra-
tion in Auckland.
Dental care for New Zealand child-
ren is claimed to be the world’s best.
The Government provides all children
between the ages of to 16 with free
dental treatment at six-monthly inter-
vals. Under the direction of a district
dental officer primary and pre-school
children are treated by trained school
dental nurses at clinics attached to
schools.
The principal of each school is
assisted by dental surgeon instructors
and dental tutor sisters. After graduat-
ing the girls are posted to the 1207
field clinics, usually under the charge
of an experienced nurse at first.
Eventually they are appointed to sole-
charge positions, each responsible for
about 500 children. Finally they may
become dental tutor sisters, dental
nurse inspectors, or matrons.
Under the Social Security (Dental
Benefits) system introduced in 1947, the
post-clinic group is cared for by pri-
vate practitioners, who also undertake
treatment beyond the scope of the
school dental service. There is a free
choice of dentists, who have the right to
decline patients, although 98 percent of
dentists in general practice are con-
tractors under the scheme.
New Zealand’s school dental health
scheme has helped other countries.
Under the Colombo Plan, the World
Health Organisation, and the special
Commonwealth African Assistance
Plan girls have come for primary and
post-primary study at the training
centres from Ceylon, Singapore, West
Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Sabah,
Hong Kong, Ghana, and Sarawak. A
senior dental officer and senior tutor
sisters were sent to Ceylon to help
organise a similar service there.
And at the request of the Govern-
ments concerned, New Zealand has also
assisted by sending staff to West
Malaysia, New Guinea, Sabah, and
Singapore. The dental division has also
seconded officers to the South Pacific
territories administered by New
Zealand.

What kind
of CATHOLIC
EDUCATION?
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
CRITICS OF Catholic education in
Australia commonly make two kinds
of attack, often without seeming to
realise their apparent incongruity. On
the one hand the schools and their ad-
ministrators are accused of being too
devoted to bricks and mortar, to build-
ing programs, to expanding the
physical appurtenances; on the other
they are alleged to be too quietistic,
too sure that God’s Grace will flow
in once the walls are up, too ready
to assume that when the nuns and
brothers are set up all kinds of spiritual
and educational benefits will follow.
In the former case they are too
materialistic; in the latter spiritually
presumptuous, members of a kind of
Christian cargo cult.
These are, of course, tough times
for Catholic administrators and organ-
isers. Surrounded by an increasingly
literate and liberal Catholic intelli-
gentsia, both clerical and lay, anxious
to try out its new vocabulary of terms
like “essentialism,” “integralism,”
“triumphalism,” “nominalism,” as well
as the old ones such as “materialism”
and “quietism,” it is a wonder that
any of God’s children have got wings
at all.
The laborers in the vineyards of
education must be feeling the most
bewildered. For a hundred years they,
and their forefathers, have borne the
heat of the day without complaint, and
now they have to worry about whether
they have been worthy of their hire.
For most of that time the Catholic
Church in Australia has devoted up to
80 percent of its clerical and financial
resources to establishing and maintain-
ing its own system of schools. Bishops
have spent some of their deepest
energies in raising mortgages, priests
their time in trying to pay them off,
and brothers and nuns their lives in
poverty, chastity, and obedience: all
so that Catholic children could go to
Catholic schools.
And now the question is up, to be
quelled by no possible censure: has it
all been worth the effort? Has the
school system been far too great a
rain on the Church’s spiritual and
temporal resources? Do the Catholic
schools even work more harm than
good? Are they successful even in
secular studies? They are questions of
consequence not only to Catholics.
Dr. Brian Crittenden, an Australian
priest, has recently maintained that
historical circumstances have changed
and there is no serious reason for a
Catholic school system today. He has
gone so far as to speak of the Govern-
ment school, “the agent of civil societv.”
as the “bearer of the common values
of our culture.” In the new and im-
pressive Catholic journal of education
called of course “Dialogue,” a
Catholic lay-teacher has produced an
eight-page article, “The Arguments
Against a Catholic School System—a
Summary.”
In the United States the abolitionist
point of view has been put by Mary
Perkins Ryan, who says “No” to the
question put by the title of her book
“Are Parochial Schools the Answer?”
Such an answer must seem ungenerous
to the nuns and brothers, until recently
mostly of no great education them-
selves, who have toiled away under their
three vows (and often under the lash
of punctilious and moralising Superiors)
with huge classes in ill-equipped
schools, for the glory of God, but,
evidently, the ingratitude of man. Per-
haps they should also have a closer
look at the judgments of the Bishops
who started the system and brought the
religious Orders in to man it.
Professor A. G. Austin, of Melbourne
University, explains that the Catholic
Hierarchy in Victoria, after the publica-
tion of the “Syllabus of Errors” by Pope
Pius IX and under the threat of free,
compulsory, and secular education, ral-
lied their forces against three kinds of
religious instruction: the non-dogmatic,
the kind which consisted of Bible read-
ing even under a Catholic teacher and
of the Douay version, and that which
consisted of a period of religious instruc-
tion taking its turn with other subjects
in a non-Catholic school.
The first was not acceptable mainly
because it falsely assumed that there
was a common doctrinal ground on
which Catholics and Protestants could
get together; there could be no dia-
logue with heretics. It was also alleged
to encourage arbitrary selection of
doctrines and indifferentism. The
biblical approach was considered un-
acceptable because the Bible itself
could not be regarded as containing the
whole of Revelation and the Bible
needed the authority of the Church for
its interpretation.
As for the daily catechetics period in
an otherwise secular school, Christian
education needed a total environment
in which to form souls. A daily dose of
religion was not enough. All school
activities needed to be brought within
the influence of Christian belief and
harmony. True education required a
Catholic atmosphere for the whole day.
The feelings of the Catholic hier-
archy about the secular Government
schools may be seen in the attack by
Archbishop Vaughan and episcopal
colleagues in their Joint Pastoral Letter
on Education in 1879 in which the
Public Schools of New South Wales
(in Victoria these are referred to as
State Schools) are called:
“. . . seed-plots of future immorality,
infidelity, and lawlessness, being calcu-
lated to debase the standard of human
excellence, and to corrupt the political,
social, and individual life of future
citizens ... I would call these schools
‘Scavengers’ daughters,’ because they
are the most effective instruments in-
vented by man for squeezing very grad-
ually and almost imperceptibly the
Catholic faith out of the Catholic
people.”
The children of the Government
Schools it was alleged had “manners
rough and irreverent; they have little
sense of respect and gentleness; they
have no attraction for prayer . . . Our
clergy look on the future of such wild,
uncurbed children with grave mis-
givings . . . and the ‘larrikinism’ which
seemed to be fostered by the Public
Schools.”
The Bishops’ intransigence cost them
much more money than some of them
had dreamed of—many expected State
aid for separate Catholic schools—but


their determination to resist secularism
in any form was at least physically suc-
cessful, largely because of the generous
responses of the Orders of teaching nuns
and brothers, especially the Sisters of
St. Joseph, an Australian Order, and
the Sisters of Mercy, and the Irish-
based Christian Brothers.
Since that time it has been claimed
that the Australian Church has spent
four-fifths of its human and financial
resources on providing for its ideal of
every Catholic child attending a Catho-
lic school. In the post-war period, under
the pressure of increasing costs, greater
demands for secondary and tertiary
education, the hill in the post-war birth-
rate, and European migration, the
Catholic school set-up has proved in-
capable of fulfilling the ideal. This has
been the most appropriate time for the
question to be asked: has the Catholic
school system been worth the effort?
In the welter of conflicting opinion
one circumstance has been outstanding:
the small amount of hard and detailed
research by which opinions could be
tested.
One depressing piece of evidence for
Catholics was contained in the publica-
tion of the Hohne Report between 1951
and 1955. Dr. Hohne inquired into the
careers of students who entered Mel-
bourne University in 1943 and 1944.
The students were classified according
to the systems of schools in which they
were educated. He observed that
students from Catholic schools were less
successful in both Humanities and
Science courses than students from
Independent and Government schools;
in the Humanities about 17 percent
below and in the Sciences about 16
percent below the others combined.
Hohne found that students from non-
Catholic Independent schools performed
the best.
The Hohne Report induced, under-
standably, some panic in Catholic
education administrators, but for some
years little was done to investigate the
situation more fully. More recently re-
assurance was provided by the Fensham
investigation into Commonwealth
Scholarship distribution. Catholic school
students w'ere found to win proportion-
ately more scholarships than students
from all other schools taken together.
On closer inquiry it w as established that
boys from Catholic schools performed
much better than those from the other
schools combined, but that Catholic girls
performed worse than girls from other
schools. Among the boys, those from the
Independent (mostly Public [Sydney
equivalent is GPS] and Grammar
Schools) did slightly better than the
Catholic schools and the results of
Government schools were significantly
worse.
The Fensham scholarship inquiry
produced results fairly similar, as far
as it goes, to those now reported in a
monumental study of Catholic educa-
tion by the Melbourne Jesuit Dr. Noel
Ryan. After the publication of the
Hohne Report, Dr. Ryan was commis-
sioned to make a survey of Catholic
education in Victoria. The survey he
has made is based on a complete census
of students from Victorian Catholic
Schools who sat for Matriculation be-
tween 1950 and 1958 inclusive. It fol-
lows their academic careers until the
end of 1964. The first section of the
survey compares the results in Matri-
culation and at the University of those
from Catholic schools with all other
schools taken together.
Dr. Ryan explains that “The survey
was undertaken in order to answer the
question: are the results of the Catholic
higher educational system seriously,
consistently, and significantly below
those of the other educational systems
taken together? The data gathered in
the course of answering this question
enabled us to study a subsidiary ques-
tion: where are the areas and sources
of strength and weakness?”
The statistical compilations are
enormous in scope, volume, and com-
plexity. Dr. Ryan found that between
1950 and 1958 inclusive 67 percent of
students from Catholic schools passed
the whole Matriculation compared with
63 percent of those from all other
schools. In the triennium from 1956 to
1958 the Catholic students improved
further to a 70 percent pass rate com-
pared with 64 percent for the others.
In the overall results of all schools
girls performed better than boys for a
number of presumable reasons; there
are fewer of them than boys sitting for
Matriculation and generally the girls
who stay on to the final year of sec-
ondary school are relatively more intel-
ligent and more able; they may also
be more mature at this age. But whereas
the girls overall score a 69 percent pass
rate to the boys’ 61 percent, Catholic
girls score 67 percent and Catholic boys
66 percent. Catholic boys’ results, there-
fore, are better than those of the other
boys combined, but Catholic girls are
not so successful as girls from other
schools.
Overall the performance of boys
from Catholic schools is better than
the performance of all other boys; 66
percent to 60 percent. These results
(my guess) may partly be due to two
factors: the high performance of boys
from some Brothers’ schools, particu-
larly in the Sciences, and the falling
away in the figures of some of the more
recently established Government high
schools.
In the compulsory subject English
Expression students from Catholic
schools are well ahead of the others:
80 percent to 70 percent; and superior
in both sexes. In the winning of honors,
the Catholic students are slightly
behind over the nine-year period in-
vestigated, although there has been no
significant difference between the two
over the last triennium.
Dr. Ryan makes these judgments:
• Catholic students as a group per-
formed at least as satisfactorily in
Matriculation as the students from the
other systems of education taken to-
gether: tests of significance even sug-
gest that the students from the Catholic
system are more successful on the
whole;
• the Catholic girls’ results were on
the whole as good as the Catholic
boys’, except in science;
• the Catholic boys’ results were bet-
ter on the whole than those of the boys
from the other schools;
• the Catholic girls’ results were
worse than girls from other schools,
especially in science.
“The Catholic system,” he writes,
“has the resources to maintain its
position in comparison with the other
systems by all reasonable standards,
but within the system there appears
to be either an unequal distribution
of resources in favor of one sex at the
expense of the other or an attitude
that promotes achievement in one
section of its community but not the
other.” ( .
Dr. Ryan also found that in Matric-
ulation results:
• socio-economic status was signin-

cant for boys’ schools, in favor of the
higher levels, but not for girls’ schools;
• size of Matriculation class was
significant for boys’ schools, in favor
of larfer classes (20 or more, com-
pared with 10 to 19), but not for the
larger classes in girls’ schools (10 to
19, compared with 1 to 9);
• locality (metropolitan, urban, rural)
was not significant for boys’ schools,
but it was for girls’ schools, in favor
of metropolitan compared with urban
schools (Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo);
• practically no significant difference
was found for accommodation (board-
ing compared with day schools) or for
educational classification (A and B
class schools).
At the university Catholic students
were found to perform less satis-
factorily than others in their first year
but matched the performance of those
from other backgrounds in the next
years. These facts suggest that
Catholics as a group may not be so
well equipped in intellectual maturity
and in social temperament as others,
or that they suffer from some group
tensions in the plurality of university
life. This may be because of a some-
what different order of values and
norms in Catholic and other schools.
Having been both student and teacher
in both Catholic and Government
schools I may be able to indicate some
of these differences.
Until a few years ago, the pattern
of values and norms in Catholic edu-
cation probably had not changed much
for a century. You can still hear hymns
like “O Purest of Creatures” being
sung with devotion.
“O Purest of Creatures, sweet mother,
sweet maid,
The one spotless womb wherein Jesus
was laid,
Dark night has come down on us
mother and we
Look out to thy shining sweet Star of
the Sea.”
The hymn must be known to all Aus-
tralians educated in Catholic schools.
The tune is a cross between “sing-song”
and dirge. The words go well with a
background of holy pictures and Pelli-
grini plaster-cast statues. The senti-
ments, however, whatever their rating
on an aesthetic scale, are strong.
“Mother of Mercy,” “To Jesus Heart
all Burning,” “Sweet Sacrament
Divine,” and other hymns you may still
hear walking past Catholic schools
today. In a primary school, after a last
rousing refrain, the strains of the hymn
may fade into a quick round of arith-
metical tables: “Six ones are six, Six
twos are twelve, Six threes are eighteen
“O Purest of Creatures” is worth a
mention, because it is one of those
representative hymns; a witness to one
of the distinguishing values and
emphases of Catholic schools. Such
hymns and prayers with words in them
like “pure,” “spotless,” “immaculate,”
“undefiled” are evocative of a non-
sensual, non-sexual (and sinless) order
of things. A kind of virgin world in
which the flesh is subject to the com-
mand of the will and concupiscence is
unknown, as in a well-run convent.
(Faith, hope, and charity; and the
greatest of these is “chastity” is a popu-
lar joke among the more emancipated
laity and clergy and it identifies the fact
that compared with Government schools
and some Independent schools sexual
chastity is very high in the Catholic
order of priorities, possibly just under
religious observance.)
The order of priorities in Catholic
education seems to go roughly like
this:
religious observance
sexual morality
scholastic diligence
verbal honesty
financial honesty
personal charity
economic and social ambition
social conscience
■good manners
(In girls’ schools good manners
moves up at least two places.)
There are noticeable differences in
Government schools, schools in my
judgment formed from teaching experi-
ence and from many discussions with
teachers; scholastic diligence seems to
lead from honesty and personal charity
in Government schools. Whatever the
practice, it seems that strict sexual
morality is down the scale, probably
below ambition and on a par with
social conscience. Church or sacramen-
tal attendance probably is about as
important in this scale as sporting ex-
cellence is in a Catholic boys’ school
a not insignificant place.
Teachers in Protestant Independent
schools, when asked to comment on
this scale, have generally agreed that
honesty leads scholastic diligence, and
sexual morality comes next. It is
claimed that in some Protestant schools
there is a great deal of emphasis on
social conscience, and not only of the
noblesse oblige kind. The emphasis on
church and/or sacramental attendance
varies a lot from school to school. Good
manners rate higher than in Govern-
ment and Catholic boys’ schools.
The order of values in Catholic
schools has possibly been sensed by
those with little direct experience of
it. Some Catholic girls’ schools report
an increasing number of inquiries from
non-Catholic parents who claim that
they would like their girls to enjoy the
“discipline” of the nuns if they can be
excused from religious instruction. One
senior nun explained that these parents
were mostly concerned about the real
or apparent moral laxity of children in
other schools. i
There are even some reasons for
exchanging the top two positions on
the Catholic school scale. In some
schools consistent failure to attend Mass
and the Sacraments is tolerated on the
grounds that such sinners need all the
help they can get. After all, the Gospel
says, there is more rejoicing in heaven
at the salvation of one lost sheep than
at the due rewarding of a hundred of
the faithful. Serious sexual trans-
gressions, however, normally lead to
heavy punitive measures and, often ex-
pulsion. In rarer cases, so do theft and
drunkenness.
In the United States a study under-
taken by Greeley, Pinto, and Rossi
suggests that the products of Catholic
schools more regularly attend the
Sacraments, know more religious doc-
trine, are more orthodox, and obey
Church discipline more readily than
Catholic students in Government schools.
However, it seems that they are just
as influenced by racial bias, as much
anti-Semitic, and no more ready to
defend civil liberties than Catholics at
secular schools. This study also sug-
gests that students of Catholic schools
may be less personally charitable than
their fellows in other schools. Further,
60 percent of Catholics without Catholic
school education thought it more impor-
tant to love one’s neighbor than to
abstain from meat on Friday: Catholic
school students scored only 53 percent
On this test.
There is reassurance for Catholics in
the available statistics of Matriculation
and University results, but behind the
figures still lurks the question of whether
the results on a larger scale have been
worth the effort. Are Catholic schools
anything like the episcopal propaganda
about them and their necessity? In
Australia the negative forces are gather-
ing strength. Scarcely a week passes
without a clerical “spokesman” or a
“prominent” layman entering the cor-
respondence columns on one side or the
other.
The Catholic Church in Australia
has built its pyramids and some of
them, no doubt, house dead bones. But
even the most progressive Catholics
may be moved by the judgment of
the tough-minded apostate Mary Mc-
Carthy, whose memories of her Catho-
lic girlhood in suburban U.S.A. seem
remarkably like those of many Aus-
tralians raised in the Faith:
“Looking back I see that it was re-
ligion that saved me. Our ugly church
and parochial school provided me with
my only aesthetic outlet, in the words
of the Mass and the litanies and the
old Latin hymns, in the Easter lilies
around the altar, rosaries, ornamented
prayer books, votive lamps, holy cards
stamped in gold and decorated with
flower wreaths and a saint’s picture.
This side of Catholicism, much of it
cheapened and debased by mass pro-
duction, was for me, nevertheless, the
equivalent of Gothic cathedrals and
illuminated manuscripts and mystery
plays . . .
“If you are born and brought up a
Catholic you have absorbed a great deal
of world history and the history of
ideas before you are twelve . . . What
I liked in the Church . . . was the
sense of mystery and wonder . . .”


FORUM
Australia’s
Forgotten
Ocean
By K. G. TREGONNING
WHEN I FIRST went to Singa-
pore 15 years ago there were still
many indications that it was a colony
and had no indigenous heart of its
own. The Union Jack flew over Govern-
ment House, and a British Governor
drove in state; his subordinate officers
were all non-Asian, and Singapore was
not their home. The education of the
area was colonial, too, based, not on
the region in which the island was
situated, but on Britain and British
overseas. Even at the kindergarten stage,
children were taught to sing “Here we
go round the mulberry bush” when none
had ever seen one, and the holidays
they observed, from Guy Fawkes’ Day
to the August Bank Holiday, were
British, and had no relevance to Singa-
pore.
All this has now changed, and Singa-
pore people are freed of these powerful
debilitating forces that prevented them
from thinking as Singaporeans. They
are now able, with a national education
and national outlook, to study them-
selves not as a remote appendage of
Britain but in their own environment.
Here in Australia some equally
irrational factors have prevented or
hindered us from thinking as Aus-
tralians, i.e., as people in a particular
regional environment. The non-national
elements in Australia that divert our
thinking and which diminish our ap-
preciation of our own true position are
almost as strong as those that weakened
Singapore, and are too numerous to
list. Collectively, without doubt, one
effect of them has been that for too
long we have failed to appreciate the
importance of the ocean that laps our
shores, and which links us —or separates
us—from the world. Despite the fact
that two-thirds of our exports and im-
ports go on this ocean and that its
tranquility is of utmost importance to
us, we have given no thought to it, or
it has been regarded, if at all, as of
interest merely to Western Australia.
This ocean is not one that should
concern only Western Australians. The
Indian Ocean should be a major factor
in the thinking of all Australians, for
on this sea moves nearly all our trade.
Yet most Australians regard the Pacific
as the sea, even though the Pacific is
controlled by a powerful friend of Aus-
tralia, the U.S.A., and therefore can
be relegated to a secdndary position in
our strategic thinking. The Indian
Ocean—vital though it is to Australia—
is ignored by all.
At this moment, acute tension, which
has led to the closing of the Suez
Canal, is in evidence at its north-east
extremity; a communist State—Kerala
—is on the shores of the northern part
of the ocean; in East Africa, communist
influence is very strong; while between
Western Australia, with its vast new
mineral wealth, and Japan, its main
buyer, is constant turmoil and political
instability.
The major threat to the peace of the
world lies in Asia. In the decades ahead
China, with its atomic power, may well
come to dominate its neighbors. In the
likelihood of this event, the countries of
South-East Asia can be expected to
move, defensively, into a policy of non-
alignment. Such non-alignment would
bring the reward from China of being
allowed to exist, but such non-alignment
would pre-suppose the expulsion or the
withdrawal of all non-Asian powers.
This development is but one of several
possibilities, but, merely because it is a
possibility, it should be a factor in Aus-
tralia’s national planning. We must
think, and plan, in depth.
A similar possibility is the disintegra-
tion of India. Are we to assume, auto-
matically, that the division of the
Indian sub-continent with the two
political units of Pakistan and India is
to exist for all time? Are there not
major factors working to make dis-
integration into further units a more
and more likely possibility? Could not
this disintegration react against our own
national interests?
There are other grave political crises
looming in East Africa, and in Western,
Southern, and South-East Asia. From
these we may emerge. The worst may
not occur. But we should be considering
it and moving toward the establishment
of a defensive presence on a vital Aus-
tralian highway—the Indian Ocean. If
the area does not disintegrate, if
Malaysia and Singapore remain our
allies, and if India and the Middle East
establish stability and growth no harm
will have been done. But to political
realists the presence of a power vacuum
demands attention. Some consideration,
then, of the politico-geographical reali-
ties of today’s Indian Ocean surely is
necessary.
It is the smallest ocean in the world
—30,000,000 square miles in area—but,
nevertheless, it stretches from 6-deg. N.
(Ceylon) to 75-deg. S. (Antarctica) and
is twice as large as the land mass of
Asia. Historically, it is the most ancient
ocean used in commercial and cultural
exchange. Excluding the Norse voyages,
the Atlantic separated Europe and the
Americas until late in the 15th century.
The Pacific—excluding the Polynesian
voyages remained uncrossed until
Magellan in the 16th century AD. But
as far back as 3000 BC Egyptian sailors
journeyed down the coast of Africa; by
2000 BC Indians were trading with
Mesopotamia, and by 1000 AD Indo-
nesians were crossing to Madagascar.


From then on the ocean was constantly
in use, the regular winds of the mon-
soons being a great factor in all the
centuries of sail-power.
During the late 18th century and
19th century the Indian Ocean came
under the control of Europe; in par-
ticular, Britain. And this is how we still >
regard it; forgetting the great changes
of the past 25 years and not seeing the
true picture. If we remembered our .own
regional environment and looked out-
ward, with the Indian Ocean as the
centre of our concern, Britain could be
seen dimly beyond the periphery as a
spectator walking away from the oval.
This spectator was once the umpire.
With Britain goes the rest of Europe.
We alone remain.
India was the basis of Britain’s
Empire, and British policy was shaped
toward its defence. British policy,
whether in the East African colonies, in
Persia, Arabia, India itself, or in
Burma and Malaysia, British policy all
round—even to the settlement on the
Swan River—was to enforce a Pax
Britannica in the Indian Ocean. Other
powers were kept out, and apart from
British naval strength—at Simonstown,
Aden, Bombay, Trincomalee, and Singa-
pore—no other naval or military power
existed.
The core of British defence in the
1939/45 war was in the Indian Ocean.
If the Germans and the Japanese had
met and broken through this core, even
if the Japanese had maintained their
control of the ocean for several years
without linking up with Germany, the
problems of victory would have been
almost overwhelming. And just as the
Indian Ocean had been a triumphal
arch of Empire with India as the
coping-stone, so it was in the Indian
Ocean that the triumphal arch of
Empire was dismantled.
The crucial fact of the end of
Empire was the achievement of the
independence of India. That was 20
years ago. The basic strategic interest
of Britain in the colonies of East Africa,
in the coastal States of the Middle East,
the Indian boundaries of the Mac-
Mahon line, in South-East Asia, and
even in Australia, all this was under-
mined and vanished. The interest of
European settlers in East Africa, the
oil of the Middle East, and the rubber
and tin of Malaysia were to remain,
but only as isolated interests without
the grand design, of the Pax Britannica.
It is these isolated interests, now almost
non-existent, that have bluffed us into
thinking the British are still in control.
The basis of the strategic plan has
been lost by a pattern of political settle-
ments. These make British power at its
best conditional and its use provisional
and permissive. Simonstown is in the
hands of S. Africa, opposed to Negro
political power; and Britain has no
rights there. The Suez Canal is con-
trolled by Egypt, and even the over-
flight of aeroplanes depends on the
sanction of African States; the extrac-
tion of oil for the use of oil-less Britain
depends on the Arab goodwill; Trin-
comalee is deserted; Bombay is Indian,
and the Singapore base is yet another
under the sovereign control of an
independent State. In addition, the indi-
vidual States which have taken over
the strategic bases and inevitably
and rightly so see them in relation
to their own isolated defence, and have
not combined to establish by joint co-
ordinated efforts a Pax Afro-Asiana,
even though it is in their interest. As
developing countries seeking the mini-
mum dissipation of their scarce re-
sources for military purposes, and the
minimum active involvement in the con-
flicts of the Great Powers, they have
steered clear of any co-ordinated mili-
tary effort. This would have been more
serious; were it not that Asia as a whole
is a land animal; so, too, Africa.
The India sub-continent, already
weakened by the Indo-Pakistan divis-
ion, has not taken on its own shoulders
the responsibility for the peace of the
ocean which is called after it. Nor
except in negative terms of extruding
imperial-power bases has it taken
a lead to establish by regional treaty
a pattern of peace. Peace has been
sought in the spirit of the first Ban-
doeng Conference by the withdrawal of
power, not its acquisition. In the spirit
of the revolutionary Asia and Africa of
today, however, with the power-
assertiveness of Peking and Djakarta,
it is a balanced presence of power
which is required. The Indian Ocean
cannot remain as a vacuum of power.
Where is the presence? Where the
power?
The British maintain a presence far
too small, and shrinking all the time.
Should the whole line become revolu-
tionary or chaotic, it has no firm foot-
hold in the area. What has taken
Britain’s place? For East Africa, there
is no defence pact at all; for the
Middle East, merely the about-to-be-
vacated Aden and the precarious
British presence based on it with
Egypt and Saudi Arabia competing
for power; India, facing both Pakistan
and China, with a weak navy, and
with a declining Commonwealth com-
mitment; and finally a declining
SEATO. A vacuum attracts, not repels,
and it is impossible to imagine that
the Indian Ocean will remain a power
vacuum for much longer.
What can we do about this? One
basic fact is clear. It is not in our
national interests that we should be
powerless on an ocean that could well,
in the years ahead, be hostile to us.
Economic, political, and strategic
reasons impel us to make a major and
concerted effort to change this position.
When you may be entering a path
lined with thorns, you do not go naked;
yet we are naked.
We have at Fremantle harbor facili-
ties that the State Government claims
could not even lengthen a State vessel
by 30 feet, and the vessel has been
sent thousands of miles to Taikoo
Dockyard in Hong Kong for this to
be done. It is also an empty harbor.
For political reasons, superficially dis-
guised as strategic, our Australian
Navy is in Singapore or in Sydney,
guarding the Pacific. One round of
talks with America would establish
America as the guardian of that ocean
it has been, after all, her ocean
since 1942. It is incredible that, faced
with this Indian Ocean vacuum and
the quite easily foreseeable develop-
ments, we do not have one active
naval component there, while the
Pacific, on which the might of the
U.S. Navy moves, caters also, in a
most irrelevant way, for all the major
components of the RAN. For many
years, the U.S. Navy was based only
on the Atlantic. Just in time, it created
a Pacific Fleet, too, and was saved.
Will we be in time with an Indian
Ocean fleet?
In a desultory way Canberra is mov-
ing to have a feasability study under-
taken of Cockburn Sound. It is a scan-
dal that in this year and age such a
study has not yet been made. Even at
such a late stage, it has yet to be under-
taken. What we need here is the Navy
and the Air Force, but, above all, we
need at attitude of mind that looks out
and accepts the Indian Ocean as basic
to Australia’s defence. The appointment
of a Commander-in-Chief Indian Ocean
Navy, symbolising an outward-looking
responsibility, would be a dramatic way
of establishing this attitude. We need
acceptance of this ocean, not as a sub-
sidiary factor, but as our major defence
responsibility.
We cannot ensure this with our own
limited resources. It is essential that we
show' clearly our purpose and resolve
by active measures aimed at defending
the vast trade that moves to and from
Australia; but we should then actively
seek effective support. Firstly, we should
endeavor, through international diplom-
acy, to consult all who are in-
volved in the Indian Ocean. No or-
ganisation exists —political, economic,
academic —that brings together all who
are involved in this ocean. We should
foster such organisations. Perth is the
ideal place to hold conferences on Pan-
Indian Ocean affairs, and attempts there
should try and stimulate a Pan-Indian
Ocean awareness. Politically, some
peaceful pact could follow. Economic
Pan-Indian Ocean efforts should be con-
sidered, and other organisations on a
Pan-Indian Ocean basis sponsored,
preferably in Perth.
Secondly, we should be moving to
have our minute efforts reinforced.
There is only one ally here w'orth con-
sidering. Britain cannot be considered
for a moment. It is moving out, not in,
and friendship should not disguise
reality. The U.S.A. is the only ally,
and I see no reason why it should not
be brought at once by us into a de-
tailed consideration of this Indian Ocean
vacuum. Albany would be an ideal
base for nuclear submarines, as the
submarines and their atomic weapons
could vanish into the vastness of the
Antarctic. But whether it is Albany or
Cockburn Sound, we should secure
American involvement in the mainten-
ance of a peaceful Indian Ocean. Time
is of the essence, and we have sat in the
sandhills for too long.

A tourist's nightmare of Canberra
By CHARLES HIGHAM
IN THE ART GALLERY at Parlia-
ment House, Canberra, a painting
shows the artist’s vision of an ideal
capital, conceived in 1901; an Anti-
podean Venice, with a series of moss-
green spires, a Byzantine tower, the
Governor-General’s water-gate entrance
on the left. A pillar surmounted by the
British lion stands in the foreground,
and “on the sloping hillsides and down
to the water (of Lake George) are the
palatial buildings of State and learning,
whilst dotted among the foliage appear
the villas of the residents.” This bizarre
Vision Splendid may not have been
matched in Canberra today, but the
beauty of the setting, arboreally elegant
and formal, and the city plan itself,
with its two great hubs from which
spread, like the spokes of wheels, the
long and leafy streets, reflects an
approximately pretty ideal.
Behind the city the Brindabella
Range is like a series of cardboard cut-
outs, changing from a threatening
thundery black to mauve and violet and
pink and scarlet, under whorls and sails
and forks of cirrus and cumulus. But
in Canberra itself the texture of the
scene is altogether different. It seems,
in the floating mists of morning, entirely
Chinese: camel-humps of hills in collars
of white vapor, spiky bare branches
piercing the clouds, rolling fields that
could be leading up to the Great Wall,
a spectacle still and formalised as a
landscape scroll.
Against this exquisite setting, Can-
berra itself barely seems to exist. Most
cities impose their beauties or horrors;
they assault and batter the senses. Can-
berra retreats palely from the line of
vision: discreet, self-effacing, so that
from certain angles, even at the heart
of the city, it almost vanishes in a
series of planes behind its thousands of
imported trees. It is lost not only in
earth but in space; the sky and the
bowl of mountains enclose it in a
shimmering emptiness that altogether
swallows its pomposities.
And there are pomposities in plenty.
I encounter the most grandiose of these
almost right away: Parliament House.
A flight of steps leads up to Ivor Hele’s
portrait of a Menzies like a pouter
pigeon, and, on a flanking pillar to the
right, Dargie’s insipid likeness of the
Queen. Nearby there’s a stone lion and
a unicorn from the British Houses of
Parliament, and framed between them
a chunk of stone coated with London
grime bearing the legend: “Lest we
forget” that the British house was the
mother of this one, presumably; but we
aren’t likely to, in a hall in which mas-
sive paintings of the Governors-General,
resplendent in a blaze of ceremonial
robes, beat into nervous retreat a batch
of Australian politicians looking like
undertakers.
For some reason, Parliament House
does double service as a kind of weird
art gallery reflecting various aspects of
Australia’s and Britain’s past: Ivor
Hele’s daub of the Opening of the 3rd
Session of Parliament, and a represen-
tation of an earlier royal opening with
the imperial lady visitors awkward in
cloche hats, busts of Pitt and Fox, pic-
tures of the Chief of the Sandwich
Islands and of the death of Cook, and
an exhibition of Marian Rowan’s New
Guinea pictures of birds and flowers,
flanked by the lady herself.
I leave the building, and everything
is extraordinarily still. We are in a
city near to noon on a working day,
but nothing is stirring. Ahead, a great
avenue sweeps pink and green to
the defiantly ugly war museum. Cars
are seldom heard, and I have spoken,
so far, to only one person.
Next day, a series of tours, driven
by guides whose voices have been made
monotonous by long practice. The
tours are faced with the rare problem
of a city almost totally without color
or spirit, so that the sight of Phar Lap’s
heart in the Institute of Anatomy a
141 b. object like a huge broken white
shell in a bottle assumes a fantastic
importance. The Area’s history is rep-
resented by a small cottage with patch-
work quilts, harmonium in the corner,
and leg-irons on the mantelpiece, and
by the Governor-General’s overbearing
mansion, originally owned by the
Campbells and luckily to be seen only
from the hilltop. And that’s all. A
series of hikes around dams can scarcely
raise a flicker of interest in even the
most eager tourist. The Mint, though,
causes some facetious passengers’ jokes
about making off with the money, and
we learn that it would take 30 years
using oxy-acetylene torches to drill
through the vault’s steel walls.
Of the tours’ other objectives, the
most peculiar is that pacifist’s night-
mare, the War Memorial, a gleeful
bumper collection from several wars,
so fanatically assembled that even the
carrier pigeons have been stuffed or
kept, and bits of shrapnel, tattered
flags, a Boer War chocolate tin, a Cav-
alry bit from the Jameson Raid, a shell
from the siege of Ladysmith and the
Emden’s bell (stolen in an interna-
tional incident in the ’thirties), guns,
spades, helmets, even dried flowers
that grew on the fields of France have
been preserved. Huge dioramas show
tiny khaki figures in wax dodging
exploding mines and a blaze of min-
iature guns.
In the Hall of Memories you walk,
stupefied, into a circular green-domed
edifice at the end of a reflecting pool
down a courtyard lined with scores of
thousands of grey names of the dead
stamped for ever into steel. The Hall of
Memories is 80ft. high from the floor
to the top of the dome, dominated by
a hideous 18ft. statue of a soldier in
green patinaed bronze, symbolising, it
says, the spirit of the veteran, set
against an apricot mosaic, and sculpted
by Raymond B. Ewers. Even more dis-
agreeable are the three huge stained-
glass windows; the “glass ranges
through a scale of a hundred shades,
from deepest sapphire and turquoise to
the palest of greys and blues.”
Above you is the mosaic like a
scooped-out orange covering 13,694
square feet containing more than six
million pieces of glass tesserae. “It
took,” says the veteran soldier on duty
at the door, “one Eyetie three years to
do the glass.”
After a day of this, Canberra at
night looks more funereal than the
Memorial itself. The Civic Centre,
humdrum and deserted, the bleak,
uninspiring clumps of building at the
ANU, and the distant shapes of Dun-
troon and the Governor-General’s resi-
dence are lifeless chunks of stone in
the middle of nothing. A cold, full
moon stares down on streets haunted
only by cars full of teenagers, shouting
at nobody to relieve their boredom.
Only at the Chapter One, a vast re-
sounding cellar discotheque cum teen-
age concert hall with bright red walls
decorated with huge blow-up photo-
graphs of a naked girl, a tiny six-inch
figure of a man crawling all over her
helplessly, can Canberrans under 21
find a degree of life, noise, and color.
But even here the tone is far less vivid
than Sydney’s. “The kids here are a
year behind the ones at home,” says
the Chapter One’s manager, former
Sydney pop singer Laurie Crooks. “In
clothes and in music. I’m doing my
best to bring them up to date.”
-Outside these rare foci of life, Can-
berra at night is a fearsomely dreary
place. The lake glitters icily, and some-
body I’m driving with says you can’t
survive in it more than three minutes,
and that the night before a man tried
to throw himself in: no wonder. Im-
ported pine forests in the moonlight are
as lifeless as a church, almost no local
animals have settled in them, and there
isn’t even the cry of a bird or the
scratch of an insect; you can walk here
for miles and not see a living thing.
Even the wading birds seem to hover
anxiously on the edge of the lake as
though they would much rather be back
in the natural splendors of Lake
George.


OVERSEAS
Made-in-Japan Diplomacy
EXTENSIVE TOURS to be under-
taken in the next few months by
Japan’s Prime Minister, Mr. Eisaku
Sato, are taken to be part of Japan’s
new, active role in Asian-Pacific affairs.
Mr. Sato’s tours will take in almost
every non-communist country in the
area. He began last month with a visit
to South Korea, and will make three
more journeys, visiting Thailand,
Taiwan, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, South
Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New
Zealand, and the United States. On
present plans, he should be in Aus-
tralia in October.
Mr. Sato’s journeyings will underline
the recent theorising of the Japanese
Foreign Minister, Mr. Takeo Miki.
Mr. Miki has been talking more and
more about what he calls an Asia-
Pacific policy. He says that Japan is
uniquely placed to act as a link be-
tween the advanced countries of the
Pacific and the developing countries
of South-East Asia and somehow to
bring them together in a common drive
against poverty.
Australia’s Minister for External
Affairs has already welcomed Mr. Miki’s
scheme, and the Americans, who have
been prodding the Japanese to do this
kind of thing for years, can only be
delighted. Mr. Miki feels sure that New
Zealand and Canada will be happy to
tag along. All that remains to give the
plan concrete shape is concrete action.
The Japanese are still laggard aid-
givers. Although they are the largest
contributors, apart from the Americans,
to the Asian Development Bank, their
total overseas aid $251 million last
year—constitutes only .38 percent of
their national income. This is a con-
siderably smaller proportion than that
given by all Japan’s potential partners
except New Zealand. Recently the
Japanese cabinet registered its good in-
tentions by promising to “try hard” to
raise its aid to the magic 1 percent of
national income that has been urged as
the minimum for advanced economies.
Mr. Miki’s movement toward a more
active foreign policy indicates a grow-
ing Japanese awareness that the ad-
vantages of two decades of passive
diplomacy have now been exhausted.
But economic worries are also behind
the shift in policy. Many Japanese are
afraid that if Britain should one day
get into the European Common Mar-
ket this would tend to leave Japan
small and isolated in a world of com-
peting economic goliaths. Mr. Miki
Prime Minister Sato... on the move
is hoping to take advantage of Britain’s
weakening ties with Australia and New
Zealand (and, perhaps, with the
United States if its Common Market
bid comes off) by pushing Japan into
a new special relationship with them.
Although Japanese traders are al-
ready extremely active, Mr. Miki
would like to use his projected charity
organisation for South-East Asia as a
means of winning wider access to these
rich markets.
Japan now sends more than a
quarter of its exports to the non-
communist countries of South-East
Asia. But its imports from this area equal
only 60 percent of what it sells. So
it is in trade, even more than in aid,
that Japan will have to improve its
performance if it genuinely wants to
assist its neighbors. But it is doubt-
ful whether Japan’s Liberal-Demo-
cratic Government will ever consent to
a more generous policy toward South-
East Asian imports when it knows that
this would weaken two of its staunchest
bastions of political support agri-
culture and small-scale industry.
Nigeria
No quick victory
THE DANGER of external involve-
ment in Nigeria’s civil war now
seven weeks old —is increasing rapidly
with neither the Federal Government
in Lagos nor the Ibo-dominated break-
away Republic of Biafra in sight of
victory.
Both sides are anxious to find allies
to supply them with military and other
support to enable them to achieve a
quick and clear-cut result.
Britain, as the traditional supplier
of arms to the Federal Government,
has resumed its shipment of arms.
Two twin-engined jet fighters supplied
by Czechoslovakia have recently ar-
rived in Lagos. Aid has also been
sought from Russia. The Biafrans are
also succeeding in getting supplies
through secret arms dealers in Europe.
Meanwhile, fragmentation of the
250 linguistic groups among Nigeria’s
50 million inhabitants is spreading
and the country’s economy is being
strangled. Already, the entire charac-
ter of its power structure has changed
dramatically. No longer is it a
country dominated by the three major
national groups the northern
Muslim Hausas, the Yorubas of the
west, and the Ibos of the east. The
era of the old northern-dominated
Nigeria has passed. It is now effec-
tively broken up into six States.
There is also a clamor to divide the
western region into two Yoruba
States.
Today, the army of the Federal
Government is largely dominated by
the minority groups, especially by the
Plateau and Benue peoples of the
north, the mid-westerners and the
non-Ibo easterners. General “Jack”
Gowon a Christian from a tiny
Plateau tribe—typifies the new leader-
ship of the minority peoples. He is
surrounded, both in the army and the
civil service, by key people drawn
from the minorities.
Significantly, the July 6 decision to
“crush Biafra” was explained by the
Federal Government not in terms of
stopping the seven million Ibos from
seceding but to prevent them from
“carrying off” the five million non-
Ibo minority peoples in their break-
away republic. “Let the Ibos go, but
they must go alone,” is the federal
slogan.
So far, the two successes of the
federal troops have been in Ogoja and
Bonny, both minority regions. There
are reports, too, of local insurrections
in the swamps of the oilfield region.
Although the university town of
Nsukka was captured by federal troops
a month ago, no significant advance
has been made from the frontier post
of Iboland into the Ibo heartland. The
lesson is clear: while the minorities
either welcome or passively accept
the federal troops, the Ibos are ruth-
lessly defending their hearths and
homes in every bush village.
Their successful counter-thrust last

week to take' Benin, the capital of the
mid-western Region, inflicted a severe
setback on Federal Army plans.
The capture of Benin was not
achieved so much by Biafra’s armed
strength as by the clever exploitation
of allies within Colonel David Ejoor’s
military command. This was helped by
the presence of about 750,000 Ibos in
the mid-west.
However, it would be a great mistake
to suppose that Biafra can consolidate
its hold on the mid-west Region, two-
thirds of whose people are not only non-
Ibo but bitter opponents of the Ibos. As
a piece of strategy the capture of Benin
was brilliant; but its longer-term effects
on the Ibo minority within that region
could turn out to be disastrous in
increasing the scale of the civil war.
The drain on Nigeria’s resources is
impossible to reduce to statistics. Gross
national product and foreign exchange
reserves were falling before the fighting
began. Oil exports and oil revenue
about s22£ million last year to the
Federal Government and other regions,
about S2BJ million to the east have
ceased. A more permanent fear is that
the fighting has scared off foreign
investment.
The Federal Government, one of its
officials recently remarked, “is prepared
to spend itself into bankruptcy” to win
what it calls “a police action against
Ojukwu and his rebel clique.” That
could mean a long time: beset though
it is by fiscal problems, Nigeria remains
basically wealthy. Biafra, on the other
hand, can run out of credit more
rapidly. Its reserves were never that
large, and its expenditure on armaments
has been very heavy.
But economics will not decide the
issue. The Ibos regard the war as a
struggle for survival and are fighting
accordingly. Reports from the east
indicate that northern Hausa troops are
having difficulty distinguishing civilians
from combatants in villages where al-
most every hut and bush houses a
sniper. General Gowon is believed to
be trying to make sure that they at
least make the attempt.
Apart from wondering how long the
fighting can last before Federal troops
General Gowon ... no victory in sight

U.S. Negroes
Guerilla tactics
NOW THAT BLACK POWER has
moved ahead to a new phase as a guer-
illa movement in cities throughout
America, it can be seen that the new
Negro leaders differ radically from
other Negro leaders and organisations.
They are outside the establishment
and do not have access either to white
liberal leaders or to the President.
Furthermore, at this point, they have
no wish for such contacts; rather their
program is one of negation and
rebellion. They are neither for civil
rights nor for racial integration. Thus
their strength derives from their hatred,
and their plan calls for destruction and
violence.
Thus it is a revolutionary dogma that
is being preached by the advocates of
black power, like the militant H. Rap
Brown, and, while their numbers are
small, they command the attention
and the respect of a sufficiently large
number of urban Negroes to pose a
genuine threat to law and order. For
what is only now becoming clear for
the first time is that these black nation-
alists have direct lines into the Negro
communities and are in closer contact
with the ghetto than are the leaders of
the regular Negro organisations. In
part, this is why the major Civil Rights
groups did not demur when black
nationalists pushed through calls for
“blacks only” policies black co-
operatives, black banks, black civic
organisation.
None of this would be quite so intimi-
dating if it were confined strictly to
politics and jockeying among Negro
leaders. However, the black militants

are now taking up guerilla tactics and
are seeking to co-ordinate some of their
activities. A few of the nationalists pro-
claim that they are Maoists, but the
majority are non-ideological, except of
course that all are anti-colonial and
anti-white. Moreover, what unites the
two groups is their newly found interest
in underground military tactics. Thus,
in Detroit, one plan counted on wide-
spread looting to draw the police force
to the downtown Negro area, while the
nationalists selected targets for burning
and destruction in white sections of the
city. The police, however, were not
lured in.
It should be added that these are
local, not national, plans. So far, each
city has its small group or groups and
its own leaders, much in the manner
of gangs. A black power group may
consist of less than one hundred mem-
bers but it is strengthened by the fact
that the Negro community will conceal
and protect them. Furthermore, the
ghetto itself is ripe for unorganised,
chaotic insurrection.
Meanwhile, a few militants have been
travelling around the country train-
ing black nationalists to use automatic
weapons and tactical plans of operation
have been drawn up by several groups.
The absence of a national leader and
of national headlines has helped con-
ceal much of this. There is a con-
certed (and successful)' effort to con-
tinue this secrecy.
For the moment, much of white
America is merely frightened; but it
will take only a few incidents which
do finally manage to penetrate the
larger white community (thus far the
destruction and the fighting have been
contained in and around the ghetto)
for white militants to organise. It is
this prospect that the Administration
finds particularly alarming. Vigilante
groups in the northern cities could well
touch off a domestic race war. To the
advocates of black power, this is desir-
able, for then they expect that they
will be able to mobilise the Negro
masses. (Black Muslims, for example,
have already indicated that they sym-
pathise with some of the black power
aims.) Moreover, they are counting on
white vigilantes to force Negro soldiers
and ex-servicemen to become black
nationalists, contributing their exper-
tise and, where possible, their weapons.
There are at present 100,000 Negro
soldiers in Vietnam, and perhaps as
many serving elsewhere in the Forces.
That such a course of action is nihil-
istic seems self-evident. There are, after
all, 20 million Negroes as opposed to
180 million whites in America. A bitter
racial war, practised guerilla fashion
or not, could lead to mass killings of
Negroes by troops and eventually to
some form of concentration camps.
But then, several black nationalists
have already exclaimed, “If we don’t
fight now, they’ll lead us to the gas
chambers in another ten years.”


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Four successes, one failure
By JOHN CARGHER
Rigoletto (Verdi); Don Giovanni
(Mozart); II Trovatore (Verdi).
Elizabethan Trust Opera Company.
Her Majesty’s, Melbourne.
AS I REMARKED when the Eliza-
bethan’s opera season began, perfection
in repertory is rare and only attained
at the expense of many failures. With
only one failure in five the Trust’s new
“Rigoletto” was bought cheaply. It is
as close to perfection as any opera
house could wish; an astonishing
achievement for this company, it is even
better than last year’s “Trovatore.”
Verdi’s opera is far from foolproof, yet
the much maligned (by me among
others) Stephan Beinl has produced an
ideal stage picture peopled by believable
characters. In this he is helped by a
fine set by Ron Reid, which almost
solves Verdi’s unsolvable problems, and
some superb costumes which, like most
of the Trust’s best costumes, were de-
signed by someone not acknowledged
on the program.
But the glory of Verdi lies in the
singing, and this is so good as to be
almost beyond criticism. Raymond
Myers is surely on the way to world
fame. His Rigoletto is the most genuine
jester I have seen, and with experience
he will surely touch the heart in the
later scenes. Vocally he is magnificent,
with positive prospects of becoming-
superlative when he acquires the arts
of a crescendo and diminuendo. Donald
Smith’s Duke can hold his head up
anywhere. Fine Verdi tenors are hard
to find and we are indeed fortunate to
see and hear him in his prime. The
Gilda of Janice Taylor is of the small-
voiced coloratura type we have come
to accept (wrongly) for this part. She
sings well and looks superb. The rest
of the cast is equally good; in fact,
Donald Shanks’ Sparafucile is almost
better than the fine major principals,
while Luciano Borghi makes a real
character out of Monterone and Morag
Beaton’s Maddalena is most suitable
man-bait.
Verdi demands more than usual
from the chorus in its small contribu-
tion to this opera. The first scene is
not choral work but ensemble singing
of some complexity, and here the
chorus is indeed an ensemble of soloists
instead of a homogeneous mass of
voices. Robert Feist conducted very
well, though lesser voices might have
been overshadowed by the orchestra’s
volume.
‘Don Giovanni,” presented as a game
of chess, proved a mismatch and
Mozart gave up after the first few
moves. Twenty-one-year-old Jim Shar-
man may be a budding genius but he
knows nothing about opera and com-
mits blunder after blunder from the
very opening, in which the Commen-
datore is killed by a thin rapier pierc-
ing solid armor plate, to the end, when
the same Commendatore (now dead)
appears as a white-faced statue wearing
brown corduroys and silver boots. Mr.
Sharman also knows nothing of chess,
which has two leading ladies, not three.
But then any pretence at keeping to
the original idea was dropped by pro-
ducer, designer, and cast very quickly
and we were left with a bare stage
production well-sung without any
attempt at Mozartian precision or feel-
ing. The singers were well matched in
voice but made little individual effort
at co-operating with each other or the
conductor. Neil Warren Smith’s Don
was good enough. Rosemary Gordon
and Marcella Reale showed plenty of
Raymond Myers ... genuine jester in
“Rigoletto”
voice without any recognisable style.
Only Maureen Howard gave full value
with a well-sung and superbly elear-
dictioned Zerlina, and Robert Gard
unexpectedly provided four minutes of
good Mozart in “II mio tesoro.” But
even at the best of times the singers and
Thomas Mayer’s orchestra sounded
muddy in ensemble, and Mozart without
clarity is a bore, which is as good a
description of this production as any.
The revival of “II Trovatore” estab-
lishes a good precedent, keeping good
productions in the repertoire. Any
opera as well sung and as well staged
as this is worth seeing again, and the
pattern should be continued with this
year’s “Rigoletto.” Donald Smith and
Lauris Elms were as good as ever,
while Rosemary Gordon improved on
her Leonora of last year. Luciano
Borghi took over Ferrando and, while
singing well, was the principal victim
of Gerald Krug’s impossible tempi,
which moderated in the second half,
presumably because of strong protests
from the stage.

ground in the Warhol sense. They
could hardly have been more Aus-
tralian if they’d been filmed on hes-
sian and screened on rusty galvo.
But there were redeeming moments,
such as the very beginning, a little
spoof called “The Vincent Report,” in
which a ponderous address on the state
of the industry is filmed with glorious
clumsiness. While the learned gentle-
man reassured us of the cinematic talent
that abounded in Australia, the boom
wandered in and out of frame, the
image lost focus, and the camera
lurched. It was a wickedly appropriate
introduction to the ardent but inexpert
productions that followed.
John Bale’s “Portrait of a Girl”
recorded, in gruesome close-up, the pro-
cess of applying make-up. The skin of
an eyelid looked like elephant hide. The
down on a lip bristled like a hair-
brush. The lips themselves had the
texture of a perished inner-tube. Greatly
appreciated by the audience’s misogy-
nists, but over-long and sloppily edited.
“Watt’s Last Voyage” looked like
someone’s first film. It concerned an
old recluse who liked to take the
helm of a derelict ship and issue com-
mands to the seagulls. Director Brian
Davies loaded the action with so much
pathos and emphatic humor that the
film sank with all hands. A parable
about war toys, “The Heroes,” was
noble in its intent and had some nice
moments. But the theme was poorly
developed. A strong moral doesn’t make
a good film.
The ABC’s Christopher Muir con-
tributed “A Beach Day,” in which Oz
seaside habits were seen through Euro-
pean eyes. While the largely professional
cast gave of their best, direction seemed
non-existent. So did editing. The editor
seemed to have been content to merely
stick the ends together as they came
from the lab.
“The Green Carnation” was one of
four films in the Goon/Richard Lester/
Norman McClaren genre. Concerning
a blossom with overwhemingly aphro-
disiac qualities, it shared the common
fault of running longer than its ideas.
However, it was a wild diversion beside
“Daydream,” an interminable under-
water opus.
Recording the frantic flight of a
youth eluding conscription, John Lord’s
“Joseph L” was well sustained, com-
plex, and cleverly shot. However, the
only completely satisfying films were
two made for children by John
Richardson. In the first a monochro-
matic shopping trip turns to color when
a little boy escapes his mother and
takes a ride on a train. In the second
a group of boys create a huge totemic
guy for their bonfire and then fight
to defend it from an invading gang.
Both films were splendidly photo-
graphed, directed, and edited. Richard-
son mightn’t be a significant innovator,
but he’s a thorough and well-disciplined
film-maker.
Music
Monteverdi be-in
By DAVID SALTER
Monteverdi Quadracentenary Concert.
University of N.S.W.
THE MONTEVERDI be-in in sound
and image presented by Sydney critic
Roger Covell for the Dante Alighieri
Society was a pleasantly embellished lec-
ture on the personal history and artistic
achievement of the greatest of the
sixteenth century’s magnificent crop of
composers. Its careful combination of
a commentary, given by Mr. Coveil,
musical performance, from the instru-
mentalists and choir of the Leonine
C onsort, and projected slides provided
an unusually flowing and detailed
account of Monteverdi’s career and the
climate in which it progressed.
dhe musical performances ranged
through the demanding and incredibly
varied Monteverdi repertoire. Madri-
gals, sacred works, and even excerpts
from the historic operas colored the eve-
ning s listening the Consort and its
soloists attacking each with equal vigor
but enjoying equally varied amounts of
success.
And for the first time in at least my
memory of the Consort’s history it was
the instrumentalists who contributed
most to the occasional shoddy and
approximate rendition. The main flaw
here was a lack of decisiveness and
rhythmic energy in the strings. Monte-
verdi ripieno scores are notoriously
awkward, but unless they are sounded
with firmness and clarity the singers
have little chance to produce a solidly
unified collaboration. Soprano Marilyn
Richardson’s appearances in arias from
“II Ritorno d’Ulisse in Patria” and
“L'lncoronazione di Poppaea” seemed
disinterested and offhand disappoint-
ing in the light of her recent outstand-
ing performance in a programme of
contemporary music.

Laughing at "Luv"
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Luv. Murray Schisgal. St. Martin’s,
Melbourne.
ONE OF THE THINGS that’s been
hurting serious theatre in recent years
is its wretched seriousness, its lack of
existential laughter. Instead of the pur-
gative chuckle, we’ve had a funeral
march set to the tempo of breastbeat-
ing. To mix metaphors, most avant
garde plays have been little woe-boats
bobbing about in seas of pessimism.
But Schisgal is a laugher, a play-
wright who uses humor to take the

mickey out of his melancholy contem-
poraries. He’s no Pollyanna, feeling his
angst as keenly as the next man. But
he prefers the smile of irony to the
pout of self-pity.
“Luv” begins as one Harry Berlin
prepares to throw himself off a bridge
only to be halted ‘by a joyful voice.
This belongs to Milt Manville, an old
classmate who is as dapper as Harry
is dilapidated. Where, he wonders, has
Harry’s life gone wrong? Harry blames
everything on a harrowing childhood
but in a series of escalating examples
Milt demonstrates that his own was
equally horrific. Then Harry confesses
that everything came apart the day a
dog approached him in a crowded park
and lifted his leg on his trousers.
But Milt believes that Harry’s prob-
lem is a simple case of sexual depriv-
ation and it happens he’s got a wife he’s
not using. Enter Ellen Manville, brand-
ishing a Kinseyish graph of her inade-

quate sex life and cursing the Education
Department that ruined her woman-
hood by awakening in her a first-class
intellect. Guiding the Pathetic Harry
into his wife’s open arms, Milt rushes
off to marry his mistress. But the re-
arranged relationships don’t work out,
and soon bodies are leaping from the
bridge like lemmings.
Schisgal writes his dialogue, which
is almost entirely a parody of the ulu-
lations of other authors, for fast, even
blurred, delivery. The whole production
needs to be treated as a sort of avant
garde vaudeville, with over-stated
characterisation and tap-dance tempo.
But George Fairfax sets a medium pace,
which makes the lines sound limp and
the second act drag. Nonetheless, the
producti.-n is in objective terms the
most worth while at this theatre for a
long, long time.
The cast: Dennis Miller employs
some funny Groucho Marx movements
and mannerisms as the twitchy Mr.
Berlin but fails to produce the loony
intensity the role requires. Monica
Maugham plays Ellen too woodenly,
without sufficient contrast between the
first and second act. Only Terry
McDermott as Milt really captures
Schisgal’s scatty idiom.
Theatre
Worth the money
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Half a Sixpence. Theatre Royal, Syd-
ney.
A MUSICAL ADAPTATION of
“Kipps”, this slight, amiable little show
skates lightly through the story of the
obscure draper’s clerk who inherits a
fortune without attempting to reproduce
any of Wells’ rich characterisation or his
implied social criticism: the plot,
stripped to its bare bones, is there as an
excuse for a number of merry song-and-
dance numbers.
It is a strangely old-fashioned musical
—the songs aren’t used to develop or
comment on the action; rather the dia-
logue sequences are there to provide the
occasion for a production number. But,
fortunately, the music and lyrics are
gay and lively, the cast is enthusiastic,
and Betty Pounder’s choreography man-
ages ingeniously to give the impression
that the dancers are doing a good deal
more than they are. And above all it
has in Mark McManus a star of en-
ormous vitality and appeal, who brings
not only energy but a genuine warmth
to his picture of the underling delighted
and bemused by his sudden wealth.
Altogether an engaging entertainment,
only marred by one of the thinnest
orchestras imaginable, who sounded as
if they all three of them were
playing several blocks away rather than
in the pit of the Theatre Royal.

Beholder's eye

American Painting. Art Gallerv of
N.S.W. 7

Sydney.

Alun Leach-Jones. Watters Gallery,
Sydney.
CARTOONISTS and columnists who
had fun noting how people stared into
Ad Reinhardt’s three black voids, seek-
ing a sign of the symmetrical crosses
or of eternal truths or of the suicide
of art as one critic averred, were, like
many a humorist, skirting the edge of
truth. In fact, some Gestalt psychologists
suggest that we should stare at simple
forms and seemingly empty painting to
see what is happening. That old Gestal-
tian, Cezanne, said, “Time and reflec-
tion change the sight little by little till
we come to understand,” and in this
matter Reinhardt and Watkins are
exemplary.
Reinhardt’s “black” paintings, with
hardly discernible crosses, should
please the retina though they may out-
rage one’s preconceptions of w'hat a
painting should be; they are relaxed
and free of tensions, but prolonged
scrutiny bears out Rudolph Arnheim
(“Towards a Psychology of Art,”
Faber), who says that after some time
the eye, which biologically seeks to
note changes, begins to fragment the
forms, and the mind, wdiich can’t stand
visual boredom, begins to restructure
the shapes. In one of Reinhardt’s paint-
ings, the cross-bars alternately expand
and contract, four triangles of black em-
phasis appear where the bars cross and
the black-violet grows stronger. Simple
forms, as in Reinhardt and Watkins,
create after-images, and with Reinhardt
the effect is that these “dead” areas
begin to pulsate and the after-image
effects are so pervasive that the black
works seem composed of shifting veils
of dark grey.
Is that art? It is as relevant to ways
of looking as is the traditional proced-
ure where one’s eye is stimulated to
skip around the painting by related
forms and colors. Reinhardt and, to
some extent, Watkins rely on the effects
of visual satiation wdiich forces us to
reconsider each form in its relation to
others.
Watkins, who was briefly a good
action-painter, then a rough-carpenter
with driftwood, a more skilled one with
colored slats, and most recently a hard-
edge abstractionist relying on the pres-
sures of areas, is now more linear,
using forms more in the manner of a
Krushenick or Stella. Some are like

Pow! In Homage to Busby Berkeley ,
(96in. by 96in., $750) a scalloped pale
yellow flower-shape, outlined in green,
is caught on a deeper yellow ground,
between two stepped areas of blue. A
series of dark red arcs leap across the
flower form and the effect is one of
luminous ecstasy and the sudden emer-
gence or creation of forms. On con-
templation (no passive activity, by the
way) the scalloped form begins to
roll, just as the huge and beautifully
placed green hammer on pale pink in
Axel’s Castle seems about to sound a
gong to make the whole painting rever-
berate. .
These two works and his two largest,
each 96in. by 120 in., are not so con-
cerned with the Gestaltian ploy of hav-
ing us complete movements, join bro-
ken shapes, and so on, though Axel’s
Castle does have a set of oblongs about
to invade a pink field enclosed by
black. In fact, artists like Watkins start
where we find ourselves after ten-
minutes’ contemplation of a Reinhardt
the forms are tense and fragmented
and our job is to restructure them into
satisfying works of art. (The Gest-
altians, of course, close their pure eyes
to the idea that heavy oblongs that
pierce receptacles of various shapes
might arouse sexual associations.)
In some works Watkins is con-
cerned with pure tensions and visual
completion tests: Harlow’s Dawn
(52in. by 54in., $300), on crimson red,
has an undulating black rhythm, making
us provide the shape of the set of
oblongs it traverses; a repeated L-shape
is halted at the bottom edge by a
hollow triangle of grey that arrows
against the general direction of the
painting. The “negative” areas are posi-
tive and there’s a little bowl-shape of
red that could be used in libetians to
Watkins’ splendidly muscular sensitivity.
Sunday Light (66in. by 66in., $350),
where bars of tan cut into a scalloped
blue disc, set the disc oscillating through
the after-images they create.
It is a fine show; the color, as with
some Americans, is often a little sour,
and, curiously, some works are in the
abstract mode of the ’thirties (like some
titles) while others are rewardingly
avant garde. What distinguishes Wat-
kins is he thinks hard about the
recent past and the present, and Rein-
hardt, himself a scholar of Oriental
art, how he realises what prolonged
contemplation (not rumination!) means
visually.
Watkins, as Patrick McCaughey, the
Melbourne critic, pointed out at the
recent seminar on “Intellectuals in Aus-
tralia,” arranged by the Australian
Association for Cultural Freedom, is a
color-field abstractionist who does have
the perennial vitalism of one stream of
Australian art, but for non-analytic, non-
proselytsing vitalism, one has to look to
an Olsen, Warren, or the Melburnian,
Leach-Jones.
It is the kind of vitalism found in
Julius Bissier, Klee, Kandinsky, Miro,
and the late collages of Matisse; in the
painters’ world, where artists incline to
disown their parents, to mention father-

Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world’s choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia’s
leading imported pipe tobacco and there are three blends to suit all tastes.

comes in the red pouch.

figures seems a worse aspersion than
that of actual illegitimacy, but the fact
is that artists often have kinships of
which they are unaware. It is a kin-
ship, in the cases of Warren and Leach-
Jones, that they share rather than
depend upon.
Guy Warren, in an inspiriting show so
floats crisp, elongated, toothed, ’or
foliate forms in a void that they take
on varied roles of attraction, opposi-
tion, defiance, collaboration, and rejec-
tion of neighboring forms. This is done
lightly, not dramatically; with a Victor
Pasmore, the balance is tense, with
Miro and Klee there may be a whim-
sicality, but Warren has much of the
cool sensibility and deliberation of a
Ben Nicholson.
In most works Warren uses a large,
melting stain that sinks into the void
like a whirlpool and draws the crisp
forms toward it; it emphasises the void
and irrupts the surface simplicity. In
Blue Expanding and Prometheus 2
irregular shapes like ice-floes line up
to be drawn into the whirlpool. How-
ever, in Red Expanding and Greens
Floating (a bar of purple on a blue
stain sets up a glowing after-image)
centripetal forces are rejected by crisp,
collage-like, scalloped forms of a
bright green or red that cut in from
the frames’ edge. In mid-career War-
ren has made a most rewarding change
of approach though some lighter
aspects of romanticism remain in Lake,
Mungo Bush , and the watercolor The
Marvellous Void, No. 1 and the ease,
grace, and sharp elegance is marred
only slightly by an occasional irreso-
lution in paint surface.
It is an irresolution that most of the
splendid Americans at the N.S.W.
Gallery and Alun Leach-Jones would
abhor. Leach-Jones is a painstaking
precisionist who places a circle
four in one case in the centre of a
uniformly painted square; the mes-
meric placement of square and circle
are reinforced by the kaleidoscopic,
labyrinthine mazes and convolutions
within the circles, where flat patterns in
green and red, or blue, orange, and
pale yellow, or red and yellow cavort
or gently intertwine. Three of these
“Noumena,” as he calls them, are so
hung that one progresses from quiet
folk-art patterns on purple to wil-
low-plate, art nouveau shapes on dark
blue, and, finally, to a dazzling red
and green pattern on pale yellow, where
the after-images swarm in such profu-
sion that one is physically compelled to
look at the quieter edges to readjust
the optical nerves. Others, like Blue
Ikon and Karma, are stiller and carry
a border of bright oblong mosaics to
push activity to the periphery and let
the centre, which looks like a micro-
scopic slide stained by a master dyer,
go more calmly on its infinitely varied
way.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Hopes for a 5 percent
growth rate
MR. McMAHON IS confident that the
economy will again grow by about five
percent this year. In framing his
Budget he obviously sees a good many
more expansionary forces at work than
last year, because on a straight figur-
ing the Budget is as neutral as it could
possibly be. Government outlays on
Australian produced goods and services
are to increase by $435 million or 8.5
percent. By some stroke of coincidence
(or Treasury merrymaking), receipts
are estimated to expand by exactly the
same absolute amount, to the nearest
million dollars.
Last year’s Budget was much more
clearly expansionary. It saw domestic
outlays rise by $482 million. A greater
proportion of this year’s Budget is lost
overseas as a result of big payments on
the F-llls. And whereas tax receipts
this year are to take $435 million out
of incomes and spending, they only
took $293 million out last year.
The economy can be said then to
be relatively unaffected in its pace by
the Commonwealth Budget this year.
It must be remembered, though, that
there is a certain built-in stability in
the tax system. Should the economy not
expand at five percent, tax receipts will
not be so high, and the Government
won’t be taking as much out of the
economy.
If it is trends within the private
sector which will determine the course
of economic activity during the year,
then there is no cause for gloom or, on
the other hand, for any great expecta-
tions. Most economic indicators are on
a modest upward trend, business capi-
tal expenditure being the only excep-
tion. There is, however, reason to be-
lieve that it will be picking up in the
last quarter of this year and regain
strength in the first half of next year.
The Treasury
Cash results out
“DEFICIT” IS a word which has dis-
appeared from the Treasury lexicon.
And so, for that matter, has the word
“surplus.” The logic in this is that to
concentrate attention on the likely
“cash result” of a Budget is more mis-
leading than informative. For one thing,
cash results are notoriously difficult to
pt edict, since the loan-raising element
cannot be nearly as accurately forecast
as the amount of taxes raised.
More importantly, loan raisings are
not significant in determining the over-
all impact of the Budget on the
economy. They are filled by huge
financial institutions, not small inves-
tors, and as such merely’ mean that a
certain amount of funds are parked
with the Government rather than some-
where else. They do not detract sig-
nificantly from any flow of income
which might otherwise be spent. They
do not, therefore, have the same re-
straining effect on spending as taxes.
The impact of a Budget is better
measured by looking at the relation
between total Government outlays
which generate and add to income and
the tax revenues and the earnings of
Government business undertakings,
which subtract from private incomes.
This difference between “receipts” and
“outlays” is described by the Trea-
sury in its publications as the “net
increase in indebtedness” of the Gov-
ment assuming, of course, that as
usual the outlays exceed the receipts.
Of course it isn’t a precise measure
of the Budget impact, because different
taxes affect spending to different de-
Treasury’s Sir Richard Randall
grees. A tax on beer or cigarettes will
hit spending harder than a tax on
luxuries bought by wealthy people.
Similarly, outlays to pensioners will
have larger stimulative effects on spend-
ing and incomes (multiplier effects, in
the jargon) than outlays to subsidise
fertilisers, say. Outlays on imports have,
of course, virtually no impact on the
local economy.
Shipping
Bucking freights
CONSIDERING THE FATE of Heine
Bros, venture into the Australia-Japan
trade a few years ago, the announced
venture ‘of a new British company to
tread on the Conference lines’ toes
seems foolhardy and will not get off
the ground if the combined forces of
the Government and the Conference
can help it. The Government is at the
moment playing pussy. But Conference
spokesmen have been shouting loudly,
saying it was unlikely the new company
would be able to force its way into
the trade and that if it did succeed
the additional vessels employed would
lead to an increase in freight rates.
The line of the latter argument is
that there are enough ships already in
the trade and any addition would
mean hulls were not filled. The
diminished cargoes per ship would
have to be offset by higher charges.
In the meantime, an increase in
freight rates between Australia and
Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and
the Persian Gulf has become a cer-
tainty. They will rise by 1\ percent
as from the beginning of next month
except for wool to Pakistan, where the
rise will be only four percent, and for
flour and cereals to the Persian Gulf,
for which the increase will be $1.25
a ton.
Thanks to progress in containerisa-
tion we will soon be saving some
freight in the Britain trade because,
also from September 1, the U.K. and
the Continent to Australia Shipping
Conference will start calculating freight
charges on actual gross weight or
actual dimensions of individual pack-
ages in the container at tariff rates
for each commodity. This will work
out cheaper than the old method of
charging. The British initiative in
containerisation is to be commended to
the Australian Wool Board, who
promised to bring out its report on
the subject early in August. Where is
it?


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Mr. McMahon could not “meas-
ure precisely either the monetary effects or the economic
impact of the Budget,” although the noteworthy Statement
6 believes the initial impact should be expansionary, but
not to the same degree as its predecessor.” The Bulletin s
interpretations are given by Peter Samuel on page 8 and
J. C. Horsfall on page 39.
July’s registered unemployed totalled 69,781 (seasonally
adjusted), against June’s 70,136; vacancies moved 1084 lower
to 36,453.
Trading bank advances went up by $62.9m. to $3243.8m.
in July, to compare with a $56.2m. rise in July, 1966;
deposits fell back by $6.2m. (previous July $53.9m.) to
$5258.6m.
For the markets: More of the improvement on
Australian share markets has spread to a wider range of
second-line industrials; some of the top mining issues appear
somewhat variable.
Equities in London received a mild lift from the better
July trade figures . . . Wall Street went higher early, but
profit-taking intervened before the close.
For companies: A mounting flood of reports re-
ceived great impetus from the building and associated
industries . . . Melbourne’s A. V. Jennings led in the tribe
with a 44 percent profit lift to $1,458,052 and a 12 percent
payment on higher capital . . . John Holland went up ten
percent to $537,546 (earning rate 34 percent), to pay 12|
percent on bonus-increased capital ... A l-for-3 bonus
issue is to mark G. E. Crane’s centenary; 1966/67 sees a
steady 14 percent dividend . . . Leighton Contractors shot
up by 57 percent to $358,906, giving earnings of 41.1 per-
cent on issue-increased capital . . . Concrete pipe maker
Rocla pushed dividend from 14 to 15 percent; on nine
percent more sales, earnings rose about five percent to
$BlO,OOO ... A mere 80 percent profit leap sent earnings
of Consolidated Quarries to $288,319 and dividend from
12| to 14 percent.
Finance interests of all kinds swam high on the flood—
Mutual Acceptance endured a slight earning rate droop
yet profits advanced by 21 percent to $1,266,581 ... A
l-for-8 par issue will raise another slm. for Finance
Corporation of Australia, which also announced a 16.8 per-
cent gain in profit . . . Deposit and Investment’s bad debt
problems have faded, so earnings go from $511,488 to
$1,254,111; no dividend results, but the P&L deficit is nearly
gone . . . The ES & A Bank’s Esanda added earnings of
$303,004 to reach $2,330,298 and paid $50,000 more, or
$BOO,OOO, to its parent.
Gear maker Borg-Warner (Aust.) picked up considerably
in its June 30 half-year to turn the corresponding half year’s
$268,541 loss into a $298,885 profit . . . Repco also had a
good June half to send 1966-67 earnings from $4,625,806 to
$4,747,001 . . . BMC distributor and vehicle assembler Larke
Consolidated took help from a non-recurring profit to get
earnings up by $185,570 to $656,965.
The tariff and record sales allowed Union Carbide a nine
percent lift to $1,634,072 ... on the pharmaceuticals side,
Drug Houses edged down from $1,805,747 to $1,753,107.
“Pop” in all senses is EMI (Australia), since dividend
went up 2 percent to 18 percent on 10 percent better earn-
ings . . . No pops for Consolidated Milk, which couldn’t
manage a final, so paying only a reduced 4 percent interim
. . . Australia Hotel had to endure its first loss since 1932,
at $38,386.
Scrap metal merchant A. G. Sims keeps to its improve-
ment, as, expectedly, does Woolworths (for a half-year).
MEN AND MATTERS MATTERS
EVEN IF AUSTRALIAN trading-
banks exclude their working executives
from their own boards, many other
companies are anxious for the direc-
torial services of banking general
managers when they retire.
Mr. C. R. Darvall ends a dis-
tinguished banking career of 44 years
with the ANZ on August 31. He has
been GM there for six years, and now
steps down at the age of 61 in favor of
his deputy, Mr. C. H. Rennie. Roger
Darvall did not make the board of the
London-based parent bank, although he
was chairman of the ANZ Savings Bank
and chairman of the Australian
Banker’s Association in 1962/63. But
he gained a seat on the most prestigi-
ous Australian board, that of BFIP,
late in 1964, and expects to devote
more time to that giant after shedding
banking interests. He also recently
joined the board of Australia-New
Guinea Corporation group, and now
steps into a seat on H. C. Sleigh’s
board.
In 1965 the Queen conferred on Mr.
Darvall a CBE for outstanding contri-
butions to the banking industry and
commerce. He is associated with many
charitable and community interests,
including the lan Potter Foundation,
of which he is a governor, and the
Nuffield Foundation Australian Advis-
ory Committee, of which he is chair-
man.
A Victorian by birth, he was edu-
cated in Burnie, and served the Union
Bank and later the ANZ Bank in Lon-
don in the late ’4os and early ’sos.
Although it is hardly recreation any
more, he enjoys motoring and a game
of bowls. It is a fair bet that the
boardrooms will see more of him than
his clubs, the Melbourne, Australian,
and Athenaeum.
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT of Com-
merce gave its market development
officer, assigned here for the recent
international engineering show, three
months to round up possible customers
for its exhibitors. The officer was
Douglas A. Harward, an ex-Army man
who saw service in the Pacific in the
last war and is now in the mid-fifties.
He returned to Washington last week
a pretty exhausted fellow, having made
contact with about 12,000 Australian
firms, being prospective buyers, agents,
or joint venture possibilities, and claim-
ing the initial response on a percent-
age basis was higher than in other com-
parable U.S. exhibition participation
overseas. Fifty-one American firms
participated in the exhibition and dis-
played some of the most advanced

equipment available in the States.
A Yale graduate, Mr. Harward did
post-graduate work at Columbia Uni-
versity before going to the War Pro-
duction Board in Washington at the
start of the war and later to command
a platoon in the Pacific. Since then
he’s been in a lot of countries dispens-
ing U.S. foreign aid. He established the
U.S. aid program in Mali and was
responsible for planning, negotiating,
and administering the aid program
there, in Guinea, and four other coun-
tries in Equatorial Africa. His present
job is the promotion of international
trade, as chief of the planning and
research staff in the appropriate section
of the Department of Commerce.

TOUCH
Budget takes risks
with portents of
inflation about
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IN HIS SECOND Budget speech Mr.
William McMahon gave a reasonably
faithful outline of the economic situa-
tion last week but refused to look the
inflationary portents squarely in the
face. Beset with rising and formidable,
if not precisely predictable, defence
commitments, it was right to admit
that defence expenditure, coupled with
more buoyant domestic activity, was
pushing the economy nearer the posi-
tion of full employment of resources.
But the virtual stand-still in tax rates,
and an even heavier reliance on bor-
rowing to cover an even wider gap
between estimated receipts and outlays
than last year, looked risky in the light
of the open invitation to private enter-
prise to employ more resources.
It was rather a “let ’er rip” Budget,
doing nothing to abate inflationary
pressures already finding relief in a
disturbing rate of increase in con-
sumer prices.
How the Treasurer can talk of free-
ing more resources for the private
sector and in the next breath admit
that Government expenditure is to rise
by 9| percent in a year when national
productivity cannot be expected to
increase by much more than 2 per-
cent is best known only to himself and
his departmental experts. It is all very
well to say that last year expenditure
rose by 11 percent and that, speaking
in percentages, this year’s increase will
be less. This is entirely irrelevant.
What has to be considered is the likely
impact of the massive increase in ex-
penditure in relation to all t! <■ other
forces bearing on economic activity.
The answer I come up with is that,
though the pull of the public sector
on resources will be relatively less than
last year, when combined with the
expected stronger pull of the private
sector it will intensify the inflationary
pressure in the economy.
Tracing the upswing in the economy
so far in 1967, I have recently pointed
here to likenesses to developments in
1959 which led on to the 1960 boom.
The inference was drawn that at the
very least it would be prudent now to
put both fiscal and monetary policy
on a sterner footing.
If, up to this stage, rising domestic
prices (at an annual rate of 5 percent
nationally and as much as 6.4 percent
in \ictoria) look, if anything, to have
stemmed more from cost than demand
pressures (I wouldn’t split hairs on this
because the sharp upturn in consumer
spending this year must owe a good
deal to the big increases in award
wages over the last year), it could well
be that from this point on demand
forces will be the more potent. The
latter have been given an open go by
the Budget, whereas, at least so far as
wage increases go, at least the year’s
holiday on total wage cases, if not
the pending rises from work values
findings, will help on the cost side.
In short, then, the broad strategy of
the Budget might have been better
designed had it been directed to reduc-
ing inflationary pressures. These - look
to have reached the point where their
subsidence can only be effected by a
much stronger fiscal policy coupled with
monetary measures working toward a
curtailment of credit (that is apparently
not. in the Treasurer’s economic glos-
sary) and higher official interest rates.
For the time being at any rate,
McMahon has shied away from fiscal
restraints. He prefers to let economic
buoyancy fill the tax tills and credit
from the Reserve Bank and cash from
the loan market, strongly buttressed by
banking system support, balance his
books at the inflated level set by the
avidity of the nation’s demands for
Government services, including, of
course, defence.
In effect, there is nothing in the Bud-
get, not even the higher post office, air,
and other charges, to help contain
inflationary pressures and there’s a lot
in it, especially that 9| percent increase
in expenditure, to exacerbate them.
The Treasurer has apparently taken
the view' that the time is not ripe to
mop up spending power by increasing
personal tax rates because he wants to
keep the spending revival going hop-
ing (sic) that this will eventually filter
through to industrialists’ investment
expectations and restore private invest-
ment (if it does that he will certainly
have a boom on his hands).
There is no hint that the Government
is, in the broad, thinking in terms of
cutting back consumption to make more
room for defence exactly the oppo-
site, for the Treasurer is only concerned
that private spending should increase
even at the expense of governmental!
With the economy bowling along so
freely now under the whip of wage
increases, record export income, high
industrial income generation, and record
Government spending, I doubt very
much if either a sharp increase in per-
sonal taxes or even some lift in company
tax would have created much, if any,
unemployment. Nor would fiscal meas-
ures directed to reallocation of labor
for defence. But if they had, it would
probably be a great deal better to have
a modest rise in unemployment now
than a big rise in it later on, should
the bursting of inflationary pressures or
a weak balance of payments occasioned
by an upsurge in imports (as would
be likely if the economy boomed) force
the authorities to retreat on the scale.
I would say that this Budget is going
to put to a stern test Mr. McMahon’s
faith in the Government’s ability to
maintain full employment by means of
controlling effective demand. Unless he
acts very quickly to curtail credit and
the impact of private income generating
sources on demand through a stronger
policy, it now seems he will have missed
his chance of curbing effective demand
through this indirect means. In that case
he would be left with only fiscal
measures in a “little” Budget later in
the year to achieve his object—that is,
higher taxes and charges for Govern-
ment services as mopping-up devices on
the one hand and curtailment of
Government expenditure on the other.
From a budgetary viewpoint it will
readily be seen why the Treasurer is
most reluctant to tighten monetary con-
trols because, despite some offset in that
higher bond rates would favor loan
raisings, he would be forced to rely even
more heavily than otherwise on the
mopping-up measures and on restriction
of Government expenditure. For a tight
monetary policy from a present bud-
getary viewpoint would mean on
balance, or at least it should mean, that
loan raisings should rely far less heavily
than last year on bank finance.
However, in a situation where all
sources of income generation are going
strong (even capital inflow has bucked
up lately), the Treasurer, now faced
with a need to dampen down demand
and not to stimulate it as this time last
year, had seemed rather better placed
than then to carry his Budget without
the help of the trading banks. Such a
line would have required a tough
Budget, including a sharply reduced
increase in the Government’s net
indebtedness in 1967/68. We did not
get it.

GLAMOR DEVELOPMENTS IN
CENTRAL QUEENSLAND
By VIC WORSTEAD
A VISIT TO Central Queensland after
a gap of six years has been, on the
whole, a cheering experience. Queens-
landers seem to have become notably
more optimistic and self-reliant, less
apt to blame “the south” for their eco-
nomic troubles and more capable of
looking out for ways to help their
industrial selves.
Indeed, there may even be signs of
the dangers of a kind of State chauvin-
ism following the considerable develop-
ments in the past few years. It is not
really rewarding to hear Mr. Charles
Court, Western Australia’s Minister for
Northern Development, tell a hugely
enthusiastic Queensland country audi-
ence that their State and W.A. should
perhaps make a pincer takeover of the
southern States “because they are earn-
ing so much of Australia’s export in-
come.” Development is surely an all-
Australian business, to be kept in an
all-Australian proportion.
None of this progress, also, has
brought any of Queensland’s basic diffi-
culties much closer to complete solu-
tion. There still remain nagging prob-
lems in population size and spread, de-
centralisation, and a sensible industrial
diversification.
It sounds very pleasant to hear, as
one does on all sides, that Queensland
has reached the (fashionable) “take-
off” position and that major industrial
growth is assured from the present
base in the future. There are risks in
too complacent an acceptance of auto-
matic growth. No one can deny the
obvious advances, but the future calls
out for a skilled and sophisticated
leadership which is now largely lacking.
Central Queensland on display
means principally the brigalow scheme
(to be the subject of a separate article),
Moura coal, and the crowning glory
of alumina and the port of Gladstone.
It is, perhaps, a reasonably self-
contained area, on whose development
some $250 million has been spent
during the past three or four
years. Capital expenditure on the
Gladstone alumina plant represents the
greater part of that sum, about $ll5
million. The other high points are the
Callide powerhouse and dam, the
Gladstone-Moura railway, and the
Kianga-Moura coal development.
These are all meant to hasten “the
transition from an economy which for
so long was largely dependent on the
income derived from its great rural
industries,” as Sir David Muir, the
Director of Industrial Development,
puts it.
Sir David is convinced that “by their
very nature these major activities will
attract associated industries, and their
integration into compact industrial
complexes will, in turn, create oppor-
tunities for the establishment of indus-
tries on a smaller scale commensurate
with local or regional requirements.”
Some economists continue to throw
doubts upon Central Queensland as a
region for prolonged manufacturing
development, maintaining that Bris-
bane-Moreton is still the “best area.”
Nevertheless, Moura and Gladstone
stand as particularly impressive
achievements, thoroughly established on
a firm basis of abundant natural
resources. The Moura coalfield, about
105 miles direct from Gladstone, has
been operated by Thiess Peabody Mit-
sui Coal Pty. Ltd. since July, 1961. Its
high-grade hard coking coal goes to the
Japanese steelmakers and comes from
both open-cut and underground mines.
Visitors are shown with delight the
huge Marion 8900 dragline in opera-
tion at the open cut. This weighs_66oo
tons and possesses a bucket capacity of
130 cubic yards. More significantly it

makes a terrific demand on the pre-
sent electricity supply. The company is
planning to install a second and simi-
larly sized dragline, but will be unable
to do so unless the local power sources
are consideraby augmented. Power is
a genuine problem in all these regional
schemes, having tended to lag behind
industrial demand. It is fair to men-
tion that Callide will eventually be able
to cope with the Gladstone alumina
refinery, Moura coal, the projected
Blackwater coalfields, a mineral sands
plant at Gladstone, “and many other
industries large and small, already
established or taking shape in central
Queensland.”
The new Moura-Gladstone railway
should be in full use by its proposed
completion date, April 1, 1968. It will
carry three million tons of coal the first
year and five million tons a year bv
1970. The line gives a saving of 83
miles on the present Moura-Rock-
hampton-Gladstone route.
Gladstone itself is a shambling, hap-
hazard, unplanned country town with
a superb and ranging harbor, destined
without doubt to be spoiled by indus-
tries to be dotted about its foreshores.
The population has leapt from 7000 to
12,000 in three years, putting great
strains upon housing and services. Its
citizens are convinced that the town is
fated for industrial advancement. A
vigorous council and harbor board are
doing their best to provide the infra-
structure but still have to house many
of the alumina refinery operatives and
construction workers in caravans and
dormitories.
The refinery, using Weipa bauxite,
was officially opened on August 4,
though it had come on stream well
before that date. Indeed the first ship-
ment of aluminium oxide (alumina)
reached America on June 28. It is
history now that announcement of a
50 percent increase in the current
rated capacity of the plant, 600,000
tons, was made before the actual
official opening.
This article has been concerned only
with major industrial developments in
Central Queensland, and a glamor col-
lection they make. Yet it is easy to
see the changes in Queensland’s indus-
trial composition have a long, long
way to go and have not quite ridden
free from the old, traditional problems.
Too much is still proceeding along
ad hoc, unco-ordinated lines almost
with an air of thankfulness that indus-
trial development is taking place any-
how. Many of the new industries
(alumina, fertilisers) are capital and
not labor intensive a seasonal
employment situation from the older
processing industries remains. Public
services roads, railways, water,
power call for vast and speedy
expansion. All these are tasks which
"'ill plainly tax Queensland’s reservoir
°f political, business, and academic
leadership.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Get ready to
ride with
the Budget wave
SO THE BUDGET has given the
green light to the business community.
It has left all the gates open for a mini-
boom or better in 1967/68. Companies
should now have the confidence
needed to slip into top gear and go-go-
go for the rest of the year. The current
spate of good reports is only the fore-
runner of even better ones to follow.
All this augurs well for the Stock Ex-
change. So does the walloping increase
of 50 percent to $l2BO in allowable
life assurance deductions. Not only does
this mean increased business for the
life offices, but it also means added
funds for investment in equities. The
index should benefit accordingly.
As has been pointed out so many
times before, the present high level of
the index is really due to the mining
sector; the industrial sector is not pulling
its weight. However, with the improve-
ment of performances in industry, the
increasing number of buyers rekindling
their interest in the market, and the
life companies buying up bigger than
ever, perhaps we will soon see some of
the “good old days” type of trading.
The first companies that will benefit
from this trend are those whose fortunes
ride along on the economic wave. A
company in this category which looks
ready to wake from its forced hiberna-
tion and spring into a lively economic
climate is William Adams. The com-
pany’s business couldn’t be more cycli-
cal. Its past performances have been
almost completely correlated to the state
of the economic nation. I guess this is
what you would expect of the country’s
largest supplier of industrial merchan-
dise, steel, machinery, and machine
tools. If business is booming people are
buying; if business is quiet then they’re
not buying. Thus the company is an
excellent gauge of the economy. Right
now it looks ripe for an all-time record
year. Already sales are up 11 percent
for the May to July quarter and direc-
tors have gone on record as saying they
expect the profit chart for 1967/68
to run right off the top of the graph
paper and on to the wall. With their
strong product lines such as BHP
steel, Lysaght sheet steel, Alcoa
aluminium, and Caterpillar tractors, they
are probably right. Remembering that
the stock was up over the $3.00 mark
only two years ago, it now looks
decidedly cheap at $2.12. At least it
looked cheap enough for me to buy 300.
Another company I bought this week
is Stegbar. Its claims to fame are the
Cedar and Panaview aluminium
windows which it makes. The company
was listed two years ago and made an
immediate impression on the market
by lifting its 1964/65 profit by 20 per-
cent. The good image was, however
quickly shattered in the following year*
when its earning rate crashed from
19.3 percent to 14.6 percent. This year’s
performance may again put it in inves-
tors’ good books. The half-yearly report
was that sales and profits were up in
all States and that aluminium doors
and windows were really catching on
in a big way. This is particularly so in
Queensland, for the company has ex-
panded its activities at Miami, on the
Gold Coast, where the usage level is
very high, to take full advantage of the
situation.
A technicality was the reason I
bought Thomas Nationwide Transport.
The other day, one million of the
company’s shares, which were part of
the recent Alltrans merger, were pri-
vately placed on the market. Reason-
ing that such a large parcel would
have a somewhat dampening effect on
prices for a few weeks, I decided this
was a good time to buy. I’ve always
admired TNT’s performance and reck-
oned that any company that grows
from a one-truck-one-man show to the
nation’s largest transport complex in a
short twenty years must be a good in-
vestment. I also like the company’s
idea of sharing profits with the staff.
This is always a good spur to better
performances.
On the selling side this week I de-
cided to have a bit of a clean-up. I
swept out S.A. Brush at a slight profit,
Bali Plantations at a slight loss, and
Patersons at a net profit of $5B.

Come to the Budget dance of
industrial shares
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MR. McMAHON’S “let-’er-rip”
Budget is an open invitation to a merry
dance in industrial shares in the com-
ing months, though it sent only one
special card, that is, to the MLC, the
only listed life company, which, like
the rest, should now reap a harvest in
increased life premiums. Though essen-
tially a Sydney company, which in its
darkest Palmer days was the object oi
heavy bear selling by a big Melbourne
operator, its new attractions, even
after recently regaining the ground lost
in the Palmer debacle, were as obvious
as its electric weather vane in Collins
Street. Wouldn’t it be nice to have on
the list the AMP, the CML ... oh
well, there’s no harm in wishing, even
if we’re doomed to be merely policy-
holders for ever!
C. T. Looker, chairman of the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange, was the first
broker up to tell of the good days por-
tended when on TV, almost before the
Treasurer sat down, he hailed the Gov-
ernment’s new open-hearted line to-
ward the private sector. He gave no
clues to what shares to buy. As usual,
this was left to sharebrokers John N.
Robertson, Thompson & Co., whose
advice, reaching us on the morrow of
the Budget, contained the comforting
message, I agree with Croesus on
what should have been in the Budget
for everyone’s sake I believe we will
want some heavy-handed monetary-
policy later on.” Yes, but the green
light is now on and all the traffic is
moving forward, some of it pretty fast.
If the Government wants its economic
heads seen to, that is no concern of the
market. Not yet, anyway.
After pointing to the strange
absence of specific measures affecting
the market outlook (with the exception
of that relating to life insurance), the
broker seems to think the Budget’s
main market implication lies in its
pointer to a generally favorable invest-
ment market. This doesn’t get us very
far, except that the most obvious can-
didate would presently lie in the con-
sumption goods fields, such as tobaccos,
breweries, and retail stores. In fact, the
market has been going for these in the
days following the Budget. Not exclus-
ively, though, nor, as a matter of fact,
at all urgently, even considering that,
apart from BHP (now as much an oil
stock as an industrial one), the indus-
trials market has been rising only at a
moderate pace in the past few months,
and nothing like the mining section.
While consumer goods companies are
obvious candidates for present atten-
tion, it takes some stretch of the
imagination to bring in those which
would do best in a restoration of pri-
vate fixed investment. From what he
said in the Budget speech, the Trea-
surer is looking forward to the day
when the revival in spending, which has
been proceeding for some months and
now gets encouragement to proceed
further, is translated into orders for
more new equipment, plant, factories,
shops, offices, and so forth which make
up the bulk of fixed private investment
by industry. If that occurs, then com-
panies in the heavy engineering and
construction fields would come into
their own again, and this could well
be the time to anticipate the event.
It s true, of course, that numerous
companies in this field have even been
doing extraordinarily well in the past
year or so. This week, for instance,
excellent results were reported by
Leighton Contractors, Rocla Industries,
John Holland Holdings, Consolidated
Quarries, and A. V. Jennings. If these
companies can do so well when pri-
vate investment is in the doldrums,
naturally they will do so much better
if it improves. It may pay now not
to go for such companies, whose shares
are already standing high, and look for
others who’ve been under the weather
and whose shares are correspondingly
depressed providing they are basic-
ally sound and under good manage-
ment. One of these worth bearing in
mind could be M. B. John and Hat-
tersley, which, although maintaining its
dividend, last week reported a decline
in profits from $856,981 to $682,948,
though there could be no hurry to
get in, perhaps.
Banks and finance companies are set
to do even better than they did last
year so long as the Treasurer main-
tains his liberal attitude toward credit
creation, both for his own govern-
mental purposes and for private sector
expansion. But it has to be remem-
bered that companies in this sphere
would be the first to feel the impact
of a credit squeeze and have already
taken a fair share of the market’s
The Chartist says:
DAVIS COOP & CO. LTD. now appear to have interesting technical possibilities
for further capital appreciation. The chart has only been reproduced back to 1962,
although the high and low points for both 1960 and 1961 have been indicated in bar
form. The best performance was of 100 percent uptrend from early 1964 to a high of
40c until March, 1965, when a decline took prices eventually to a low of 19c.
However, the downtrend was broken in March of this year on high volume and
prices have already moved up to the 1961 resistance level at 45c. Should prices
move above this point accompanied by high volume over the next few weeks, it is
quite likely that a short-term rise to between 70c and 80c would be possible. The
base projection suggests a longer-term target of between $l.OO and $l.lO. Last sale
price on 16/8/67—39c.

spoils this year. Some of them could
prove “toppy,” though this is not
implying a credit squeeze is just around
the corner or even further.
It seems reasonable to go along with
what Melbourne financier A. C. Goode
told the Junior Chamber of Commerce
a couple of days before the Budget—
that this is the right time to buy
ordinary shares, most of which were
scarcely above their low points touched
in the recent trough. Mr. Goode also
thinks they should be locked away
until there is a resurgence of overseas
interest in our share market. He said
that “this participation by the over-
seas investor is one of the great
dynamics in the Australian share
market and when it returns as I
am sure it will between now and the
mid-1970s the strong and broad
ordinary share market will be
strengthened, expanded, and lifted.”
ALTHOUGH HELPED along by tax
allowances on heavy capital investment,
Union Carbide’s profit increase for
1966/67 was very soundly based on
record sales in all product divisions
(plastics, chemicals, and consumer
products) and strong export sales, des-
pite tougher competition. The com-
pany was grateful for price stability,
although chemical and plastic products
were at lower levels after the Tariff
Board report.
Dividend increases in each of the
past two years (to 14 percent), after
stagnation at ten percent for 12 years,
transmits board confidence to the inves-
tor. Now down to a dividend yield of
2.6 percent, the market has returned
Union Carbide to the blue chip leader
status it was once accorded with less
justification.
AS HE SET OFF to Newport for the
America’s Cup, did Mr. Emil Christen-
sen, of Petersville, smile smugly at
the sad news from the N.S.W. cousin,
Consolidated Milk? Profit was more
than halved and dividend hacked from
11 to four percent, yet its long-time
chairman, Mr. A. E. Macartney, said
last April, six weeks before he died,
“We’re a darn sight better off than
Petersville,” by way of refuting rumors
that Petersville would take over his
company.
Should he bring back the old mug,
Mr. Christensen may be in conquering
mood in the business arena, too, and
Consolidated Milk could be cheaper
then. The shares are just holding up
above par, 50c, at present.
LARKE CONSOLIDATED hopes the
Harper Davidson ladder business will
bridge the profit gap left by dropping
the Fiat franchise. While it expects
the continuing activities to be more
profitable, it makes no other profit
predictions for the current year. The
profit just announced for 1966/67 was
not far short of that recorded in. 1964
and 1965. The fact that 84 percent
of the profit came from the motor
industry apparently surprised the
management, for they described this
as an extraordinary achievement, not
likely to be repeated this year.
For years Larke has been trying to
diversify from motor distribution to
motor building, engineering, and indus-
try services. But by acquiring the
assets and trading name of P. and R.
W illiams it becomes the largest volume
retailer of BMC vehicles in all Aus-
tralia. The 7.3 percent income yield
and 14.8 percent earnings yield now
offering from the stock at $1.03 or
thereabouts is very reasonable. Although
the company is continually shuffling
its interests, it rarely makes a bad
deal.
EMI s 1966/67 profit record probably
derived from records, that is, musical
ones. In the ten months to April, 1967,
Australian phonograph record produc-
tion soared 28.6 percent (compared
with 7.3 percent in 1966 and 11.5 per-
cent, years to June) and EMI, with its
HMV, Columbia, and Parlophone
labels, is the top Australian presser.
The unprecedented popularity of pop
records of British origin in recent
years has meant considerable growth
in this division.
Australian production of radios and
radiograms, gramophones, transistors,
fans, toasters, and irons, all of which
EMI makes, has been higher in 1966/
67 than the preceding year, although
the television market is still quiet.
Dividend was stepped up to 18 per-
cent on capital, which still left 60 per-
cent of profits for internal use. In pric-
ing the shares at $2.55 to yield 3.5 per-
cent, prospects of a bonus are not
wholly discounted.
THE INCREASE IN container selling
prices last September surely contri-
buted much to Broons’ 25 percent
better results, although directors men-
tioned only higher efficiency and a sub-
stantial sales growth in the container
division. All the profit improvement
came in the second half. Intense com-
petition and higher costs in the build-
ing industry hit Broons’ timber and
construction divisions.
The 8 percent dividend had the best
earnings cover in the history of the
holding company, with earning rate at
17.4 percent. This once more focuses
attention on prospects spread across the
whole container industry.
THE CHARTIST furnishes the follow-
ing additional comments:
BHP was recommended in the
issue of June 18, 1966, at about the
$5.90 level and again in May, 1967,
at $6.96. At this point a base projection
of $lO.BO was indicated; this has been
exceeded in the spectacular rise to
$12.30 over the past few weeks. As in
the case of Western Mining Corporation,
which continued to rise on heavy volume
after achieving the base projection,
B.H.P. is now a case for trending and
if the 400 percent trend rate held for
some months now continues, this stock
could rise close to the $15.00 level be-
fore October, 1967. Last sale price on
16/8/67 $12.10. Further comments
will be issued as and when necessary,
but, as in the case of all fast-moving
stocks, they should be followed on a
daily chart.
A. G. SIMS was referred to during
May of this year and failed to break
the critical support level at 60c. The
trend has remained neutral until
recently. However, market action now
suggests that a further move up to
about the $l.lO level is likely for the
longer term. Last sale price on 16/8/67

Security analysis
C.I.G.: a model company
for the analyst
ALL FINANCIAL analysts should be
friends of Commonwealth Industrial
Gases Ltd., particularly those who
believe that analysis is impossible with-
out sales figures. CIG has disclosed its
sales figures for the past fifteen years at
least. It also gives details of sources and
application of funds with more clarity
than most other firms.
The analyst always feels much hap-
pier when he has the sales figures,
because he can calculate the ratio of net
profit to sales and perhaps some
expenses to sales. He can calculate the
rate of debtors’ turnover and he may
well calculate also the ratio of stock to
sales and call it “stock turn” —forgetting
,*hat this figure can only be calculated
from the cost-of-sales figure. Whether
past disclosure of sales helped to pre-
dict the sharp drop in profit in 1965/66
is impossible to say, but the level of
share prices prior to the announcement
would suggest that even if the profit
fall was predicted by any analyst they
failed to convince any investors in the
company’s shares that the shares should
be sold.
The usual statistics (without any
sales ratios) are as under:

Low 5 3 82 4 20 4.90 3 25 2 25
These figures would suggest there
was a fairly marked drop in the rate
of return on shareholders’ funds in
1964/65, although there would seem to
be a downward trend over the whole
period. The tax provision seems high
in relation to pretax profit throughout
the period, but in the past two years
it has been reduced by the effect of
investment allowances. Depreciation as
a percentage of the written-down value
of plant has been fairly steady,
although it dropped noticeably in the
1965/66 year.
Even without sales figures one would
have been inclined to wonder whether
the growth period of the nineteen-fifties
had not come to an end and whether
the future pattern might not be rather
more cyclical than in the past.
During the past five years, sales
figures and trading profit (net profit
before tax, depreciation, and interest but
excluding investment income) have
been as follows and the various ratios
are quoted also:
Year to
Sepember 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 l%j,
Sales 5 million A 26 6 28 4 31 7 34 4 35 7
Trading profit s'ooo B 6870 7167 8128 7813 7500
B % A 25 9 25 3 25.7 22.7 20 4
Debtors Average
Collection 55 62 60 60 65
(period—days)
So far as I can see from these
figures, they tell much the same sort
of story except that the trends are not
as well delineated. Perhaps it is pos-
sible to make other calculations and a
rather obvious one would be the ratio
of sales to total assets, but I doubt
whether the picture would be any
clearer.
Some knowledge of the various fac-
tors that have been operating in the
industrial-gases industry over the past
five years is necessary, and one would
need to know whether the declining
margins which are apparent from the
sales figures are general throughout the
range of products manufactured and
distributed by CIG, or whether the
decline is much more severe in some
lines than in others and what percen-
tage of the total sales, total assets, and
total profits can be ascribed at least to
the major product groups. That is, what
proportions of the business arise from
industrial gases sold in cylinders,
industrial gases sold in bulk to BHP,
medical gases, welding equipment, and
spray equipment.
From the latest half-yearly report,
it seems that the first half of 1966/67
showed a considerable improvement
over the corresponding six months of
the previous year. Sales were up 10.4
(but it is not clear whether the sales
of Cobalide (Industrial) Pty. Ltd. have
been included or not), and pretax
profit excluding Cobalide was up 20
percent. It is likely that there has been
some increase in industrial activity dur-
ing the six months ended March, 1967,
as compared with the six months ended
March, 1966, and this gives reason to
believe that ClG’s fortunes may be
very closely tied to the general
level of industrial activity. Growth,
then, is unlikely to be of a high order
in the future and profits will continue
to be limited by competition, particu-
larly in the equipment field.
In fact, even after making a gener-
ous allowance for the second half of
1966/67, it seems highly unlikely that
total earnings will exceed those for the
1964/65 year when average ordinary
capital was very much less than it is
now. Of course, gross profit has to bear
an increased interest charge during
1966/67 probably about $400,000
more at least and this puts quite
a strain on net profit in ClG’s position.

SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS
AT CRANBROOK SCHOOL
An independent
Church of England School
FULL DAY AND BOARDER
SCHOLARSHIPS WILL BE AWARDED TO
SUITABLE APPLICANTS ON FRIDAY,
OCTOBER 27th, 1967.
A Number of Exhibitions and Bursaries
are also to be awarded.
An Old Cranbrookians Association
Scholarship for sons of Old Cranbrookians
is also to be awarded to boys entering
the sth Year of Secondary Schooling.
It is valued at $2OO per annum for 2
years.
Details from the Registrar, Cranbrook
School, Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill,
N.S.W. 2023 (Tel. 36-7200).
The Bulletin Index for 1965 is
now available. Copies may be ordered
for $2.46, including postage, from the
Australian Consolidated Press Library,
54 Park Street, Sydney, or Box 4088,
G.P.0., Sydney.
Next year, the interest charge will
again rise as a result of the new
issue of $3 million debentures now
being made. At least another $210,000
will be added.
It is admitted that CIG was a
very low-geared company in the past
and that some gearing is probably es-
sential to most companies these days if
they are to improve their earning rates
bn equity capital. It is, however, rather
concerning to find that over the past
two years $l4 million have been raised
by issues of debentures and shares, yet
total earnings have declined. The new
funds seem to have had the effect of
increasing sales and decreasing profit.
Currently the shares are selling at
about $2.65 and it looks as though
earnings for 1966/67 should be about
18 cents per share at the most. If one
assumes that the chairman s state-
ment in his last address to shareholders
(“. . . it is hoped, therefore, that the
oncoming year will yield higher profits
than in 1966 so as to avoid any review
of the current dividend rate”) may
now be ignored, the dividend yield is
4.1 percent. The price/earnings
multiple is 14.7 and I would have ex-
pected future growth in earnings per
share of about 4 percent per annum
compound for such a multiple.
Mining
Companies get nothing from Budget
THE MINING MARKET wasn’t
expecting anything much from the
Budget, not even a hint that Mr. Don-
ald Hibberd’s recent feelers to get
general subsidies for minerals search,
like those for oil search, had touched
a soft spot in Mr. McMahon’s heart, or
anything so realistic as, say, depletion
allowances on the scale that mining
companies enjoy in a lot of other
countries, such as the United States
and Canada. The best it got was an
assurance that the Treasurer would
smile at the private sector this year
and that, with all those extra premiums
likely to be attracted to the institutions
by the $4OO raise in the allowable ceil-
ing for life insurance, those companies
looking in the direction of the insti-
tutions for mining finance might get
a slightly better hearing. There was
nothing extra in the Budget for the
gold producers or the oil search com-
panies.
In other words, the mineral world
and the market in its shares are told
to stand on their own firm feet as be-
fore. The market shrugged off the
absence of any new concessions and
continued on its lively course to dis-
count the news coming from the indus-
try, with perhaps a mild suggestion that
industrial shares were stealing some of
its thunder and attracting some switch-
ing in view of the all-clear the
Treasurer gave to them. The industry’s
news has been a pretty mixed bag
lately, yet, in the event, the Melbourne
metals share index, which had come
up strongly—six points on the Tuesday
(Budget eve) —edged higher in the
next, few days and finished the week
only a shade under its peak of 373.3
for the year, registered some weeks back.
The oil share index did even better,
getting above 150 for the first time
this year before the end of the week.
Although now focused in both the
current iron ore and nickel spotlights,
getting W.A. nickel leases last month
(Lake View and Star, in which it has
a big stake, got some too), Consolidated
Gold Fields proved a mixed blessing to
the index over the week. Having
recently been up to $6.50 the shares
were hit below the belt by the Reni-
son result the week before and have
been gamely trying to recover the lost
ground. The blow from Tassie must
have stung, but the effect will pass off
as the pay-off of the company’s half
stake in Renison seems ultimately to
be assured when the problems with the
new plant are ironed out in the not-
too-distant future.
Admittedly Lake View and Star, on
its.gold mining front at any rate, looks
rather depressing at the moment, be-
cause last week it reported it has
reverted to a loss basis on its gold
mining operations in the year just
ended. Thanks only to a doubling of
Government subsidy, the overall profit
drop was confined to $134,950, leaving
net profit after allowing for London
office expenses at $350,000. However
completely offsetting this, the group’s
biggest minerals sands company,
Associated Minerals, of which Gold
Fields owns 60 percent, turned up a
very big trump last year to June 30
following a rise of 20 percent in its
output of rutile and zircon. Associated’s
sales of zircon were stepped up from
56,155 to 65,376 tons and of rutile,
rather marginally, from 73,372 to
75,449 tons.
The upshot was a 36.9 percent profit
rise to a record $984,757 (including
about two months profit from Wyong
Minerals, which was acquired during
the year), yielding earnings of 64.1
percent from which the dividend was
lifted from 32 to 40 percent for the
year. All this was grist to the mill
while Gold Fields awaits the certain
juicy fruits from its iron ore venture
and success in its pursuit after nickel,
which would seem to be the only
justification for the current elevated
price of its shares.
Low-grade copper producer Mount
Morgan was another share to give the
market the jumps last week because,
although strongly supported earlier in
front of its profit announcement, the
latter, which disclosed a 96 percent in-
crease in face of an indifferent metals
market during the year, immediately
attracted profit-taking when the news
was out. The shares dived from $3.90
to $3.50 in one stroke without a qualm
last Friday, recovering just a few cents
before the week’s close. The trouble
here is that, although the dividend has
been lifted from 15 to 22 j percent, the
company expects profit to be lower in
the current year; this thought should
persistently overhang the market in the
course of it. Against that the board
could certainly have lifted the dividend
higher than it did on the basis of last
year’s earnings, and would probably
have done so had it not been concern-
ed with the prospect of holding it at
22J- percent for the current year.
As yet off market limits, another
massive iron ore venture was getting
off the ground in W.A. last week with
the signing of an agreement by the
State Government and Messrs. Lang
Hancock and E. A. Wright, the pioneers
and now the reapers of considerable
sums from the iron ore bonanza in the
Hamersley. At the very least (that is,
not counting a proposed rejuvenation
of the Wittenoom asbestos diggings,
which isn’t mentioned in the agree-
ment) this could emerge as a $l5O
million project and rival the three
others now exploiting the Pilbara.
Also, of course, although they hope
to attract overseas capital to pursue
it, the authors, being local and bred
to the area, can be hopeful of Mr.
Brand and Mr. Court being most help-
ful in its prosecution.
The first aim of the group operat-
ing under the name of Hanwright Iron
Mines will be to develop huge
goethite ore bodies in the Mt. Lockyer
area. It’s aiming mainly at markets in
Europe and not, like the earlier iron
ore developers, the Japanese market.

Commodities
Pressure continues
on zinc prices
AUSTRALIA’S ZINC producers came
into line with world producers when,
in June, they cut their price back by
£stg4 to £stg9B a ton and took an-
other five percent drop in output. This
latter followed a lowering of produc-
ion by ten percent in November, 1966.
Notwithstanding these moves, prices
are still under considerable pressure,
with LME spot rates remaining under
the producers’ desired level.
Officially, of course, a cartel does
not exist. But the above announcements
happened to come just after an
informal meeting in Brussels of the
world’s main zinc producers outside the
United States.
On the whole, the zinc producers’
unofficial pricing scheme, in operation
for some three years now, has been
remarkably successful. One reason no
doubt is that very little zinc comes
from politically unstable countries. An-
other is that the amount of supply
outside producer control coming
mainly from Eastern Europe and from
scrap is nothing like as important as
it is in copper. More important still,
although zinc mining is in many hands,
smelting capacity is far more concen-
trated with most of it controlled by
the large mining interests like Rio
Tinto Zirtc in Britain and Cominco
in Canada. It has been the smelters
who called the tune.
How much longer can the present
producers’ price last? Hitherto world
demand and supply have been in near
equilibrium at the prices set by the
producers. Over the last seven months,
however, mine production outside the
United States has had to be reduced
by 15 percent. This year there is ex-
pected to be a sharp jump in world
mining capacity. The new Texas Gulf
venture in Canada alone can produce
another 250,000 tons a year or 7 per-
cent of last year’s Free World produc-
tion. Further production cutbacks—a
gift to Canada—are hardly likely to be
agreed on easily.
Price reductions on the other hand,
unless they are sizable, do little to
increase consumption. Even if the more
efficient producers were to drop their
prices regardless, it would take some-
thing like a £2O drop below 7 the present
£9B a ton before it made any impres-
sion on supply, and the more efficient
might not make enough in extra sales
to offset lower margins. Thus for the
moment the producers within the
Brussels “club” are unlikely to do any -
thing to break their uneasy co-
operation.
Pressures from outside the club,
however, are mounting. Stocks with
American producers are climbing fast.

They have nearly doubled in the six
months to last April. Unless the Ameri-
cans can agree on production cutbacks,
which are bound to be scrutinised
under the anti-trust laws, they will be
forced to lower prices. This will then
begin to make it profitable to ship
American zinc to Europe, and a lot
harder for the producers to support
prices on the London Metal Exchange.
Furthermore, new smelters outside pro-
ducer control like the Metallgesellshaft
one in Germany are coming into pro-
duction this year, and it will become
increasingly difficult for these smelters
to avoid undercutting their competitors.
Most of the Australian lead-zinc pro-
ducers have recently been receiving
plenty of sharemarket attention be-
cause of their exploration and invest-
ment interests. It may become increas-
ingly necessary to examine them in
terms of their basic operations.
OBSERVERS OF The Bulletin’s
London Commodity Prices table will
have grown well used to the fixity of
the aluminium price. Some European
commentators now see the £stg.l96
level under threat. In view of the
various large international interests
throughout the Australian aluminium
industry, and the industry’s continuous
expansion, any possible changes in
Europe warrant close attention.
Large scale aluminium dumping in
Europe may well be in the offing.
A good deal of eastern European alu-
minium is already finding its way into
western European markets at prices
more than £25 below the £196 a ton
producers’ price. Hitherto most of this
east European aluminium has been

producers led by Alcan and Alusuisse
on ?i gentleman’s agreement and at a
discount below their own price. It has
then either been passed on to their
own semi-fabricators or sold to the
independent semi-fabricators at the
official producers’ price.
The producers defend this arrange-
ment on the ground that the eastern
block countries left to themselves would
dump their aluminium regardless of
price with the prime object of getting
foreign exchange. The amount of east
European exports are not thought to
be much more than 60-70,000 tons a
year. But they are increasing and
already constitute a sizable propor-
tion of the requirements of indepen-
dent semi-fabricators outside the
United States.
The negotiations now in progress for
a renewal of the gentleman’s agreement
between the producers and the east
Europeans are apparently bogged down.
The eastern Europeans want to lengthen
the contracts beyond one year; the
western producers want a better discount
on the metal they buy.
The impasse comes at a particularly
tricky time for the industry. World
demand is no longer growing at the very
fast rates of the past few years. Free
World consumption was 12 percent up
in 1966, but last month Alcan had to
close down one of its ingot-making
plants in Canada. On the semi-
fabricating side where over-capacity, is
again becoming a big problem, un-
official price-cutting in the form of
loyalty and quantity discounts is now
widespread.
The producers’ price is coming under
increasing pressure. The big question
mark hangs over the American market,
where there are nine different companies
producing aluminium ingots. If demand
continues to slacken it is unlikely that
many will be prepared to cut back pro-
duction though Alcan hopes that its
example has not gone unnoticed. Fur-
thermore, should negotiations with the
east Europeans break down, leading to
a sharp increase in the availability of
cheap aluminium supplies, the producers
might very well have to contend for
the first time with an official European
free market in aluminium on the Lon-
on Metal Exchange. If this happened
it would be at prices well below their
own one of £196 a ton.
The independent companies can only
compete if they get their aluminium at
comparable prices to what the big semi-
fabricators pay. Whether the present
system amounts to a cartel which ought
to be broken by the establishment of a
new free market depends on whether
the producers are supplying aluminium
to their own semi-fabricating sub-
sidiaries at a more favorable price than
they sell it to the independents. Well,
are they?

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
The markets awaited the Federal Budget in fair shape and
with reasonable aplomb, then dutifully made most of their
moderate week’s advance after Mr. McMahon’s speech. Some
of the bigger miners look a little patchy, while industrials have
also proved responsive to special situations. BHP went bril-
liantly to a $12.15 peak, finishing at $11.95 for a net five cent
drop. Not unnaturally, G. E. Crane leapt forward a total
79 cents to reach $5.65. Borg Warner showed a 30 cent gain
at $l.BO, yet Repco shed five cents to close at $2.25. North
BH put on 30 cents and Mount Morgan lost 20 cents.

ASK THE MAN FROM
(for the facts about Handigas-power)
Handigas (liquid propane gas) is the most economical fuel you can use
to power fork lifts. Not only economical to buy —but, because Handigas
allows your fork lift trucks to work three times longer without needing
major overhaul, than those using conventional fuels. How come? With
Handigas there’s a simpler carburettor and no fuel pump —so fewer
problems—and, because Handigas burns clean, there’s no carbon, sludge,
or sticking valves and piston rings. Also, spark plugs last longer and
there are no noxious exhaust fumes. Use Handigas and save hundreds
of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs on every fork lift. Convert your
trucks to Handigas-power! For further information on how Handigas
saves you money, call the man from CIG and he'll convince you why
Handigas-power and the full CIG service which supports it, is for you.
Call the man from CIG and find out why Handigas-power is a better way!
Or write for detailed information and literature.

THE LAND
Eggs - industry of the absurd
By the RURAL EDITOR
OBSERVERS OF Australia’s egg in-
dustry are fond of saying that the kind
of thing that goes on here is what might
be expected in Russia.
No, no, no. It couldn’t happen in
Russia. It couldn’t happen anywhere
but in Australia. Batman or Ross Camp-
bell should be writing this. It is the
industry of the absurd.
The story of this industry is worth
recounting in that it is an example of
what can happen with statutory market-
ing schemes in Australia. It behoves all
other primary industries to avoid get-
ting into the same situation.
The firm policy of the Common-
wealth Government, the Country
Party, the Labor Party, and all farmer
organisations is that marketing schemes
can be brought in only if the primary
producers indicate by referendum that
they want them. But there was no ref-
erendum to bring in the Council of
Egg Marketing Authorities plan which
is the root cause of the current troubles
in the egg industry.
Egg Boards (State bodies) market
stamped eggs. Free-traders market un-
stamped eggs. Both kinds get much the
same scrutiny for faults and packaging
and the unstamped eggs come under
brand names which serve the same pur-
pose as the stamp.
In Victoria the free-traders’ group
collected 21,000 signatures from house-
wives in support of unstamped (i.e.,
brand-name) eggs. This was tied to the
“Baby Jones” gimmick. The 21,000
signatures are an impressive effort. They
were handed to the Chief Secretary, Mr.
Rylah, who might have done something
with them, but he handed them to the
Victorian Minister for Agriculture, Mr.
Chandler, who obviously is in no posi-
tion to do anything much as a result
of getting them.
Coinciding with the housewives’ peti-
tion was the great egg restamping
mystery. The Egg Board reported (and
got wide coverage) that a person had
been found restamping second-grade
Board eggs as first and it was hinted
that the, free-traders were behind it. The
free-traders countered by describing this
as a “red herring” and stated that they,
as much as the Board, were opposed to
this type of deception. They offered to
help the Board track down culprits.
A day after the restamping story
broke, f u 11 - p a g e advertisements
appeared in the Melbourne dailies,
inserted by retailers who take Board-
stamped eggs. These praised “genuine”
stamped eggs as supplied by the Board
and sold by the retailers concerned.
Then it was discovered that there
was no law on the books which made
restamping of eggs a crime. Apparently,
when the original stamping legislation
was passed, no one considered the possi-
bility of anyone restamping eggs.
As new legislation was required there
was an interesting session of Parliament
coming up. Several backbenchers had
indicated that they would ask some
very awkward questions concerning the
Egg Board and its operations. The free-
traders reckoned they would, at last,
have an airing in the best possible place
—Parliament.
It was freely tipped that discussion in
Parliament of the new legislation would
inevitably lead to a Royal Commission.
It didn’t. The discussion never took
place. Instead, the Governor-in-Council
simply issued a statement that it was
now illegal in Victoria to stamp eggs
without the authority of the Victorian
Egg Board.
There was still a chance that the
pending court case against the fellow
caught restamping eggs would prove
interesting. Not so. The fellow was
charged not with forging stamps or
some such crime but with obstructing
an Egg Board inspector in the course of
his duty. This amounts to pretty well
nothing at all. It happens all the time.
Victorian Chief Secretary Rylah ...
21,000 signatures about unstamped eggs
Poultry farmers are forever obstructing
inspectors in one way or the other. The
man was fined $3O and $2O.
Then the free-traders, at a Press
conference, revealed details of a secret
agreement between the Board and a free-
trader between 1960 and 1961, whereby
the Board supplied unstamped eggs, in
plain trucks, to the free-trader.
Legally there probably was no crime
here—at that time, prior-to legislation,
interstate eggs could be sold in Victoria
quite legally. Ethically, however, the
Board has been embarrassed greatly by
the disclosure—its entire marketing and
promotion is based on stamped eggs.
To the average consumer, who under-
standably is unconcerned with most of
these goings on, the most startling piece
of information is that very few of the
eggs which are sold either stamped or
unstamped in Australia would meet the
quality requirements observed in the
U.S., the U.K., or most European
markets.

Sex among merinos: chapter 2
A CSIRO study of the sex life of
Merino sheep was recounted in this
column in The Bulletin issue of July 8.
It was said then that bossiness among
rams was not a problem. The CSIRO
scientists claimed that the dominant
ram in a flock does not get more ewes
than a subservient ram, except perhaps
in a very small paddock. It was also
suggested that the ewes actively seek
out the rams.
These views on mating behaviour
have since been contradicted by Mr.
M. E. Bourke on the basis of an experi-
ment conducted at the N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Research Station
at Cowra. While the CSIRO study was
carried out in 4£-acre paddocks, Mr.
Bourke used 20-acre paddocks, yet
found that a bossy ram was compara-
tively well rewarded. For instance, in
one set of observations the top ram got
78 mounts to the subservient ram’s 43.
The third-ranking ram in this flock got
41, but he was lucky to have had as
much success.
When working among Border Leices-
ter ewes the performance of these rams
altered. Thus, while No. 1 had 46
mounts to No. 2’s 11, No. 3 ram served
20 ewes. In this instance bossiness was
self-defeating. No. 3 was able to do so
well for himself because while trying
to keep out of the way of the other
two rams he kept bumping into scat-
tered ewes on heat. Border Leicester

sheep spread out to graze and range
over a wide area. Merinos, on the other
hand, tend to stay in relatively compact
flocks and the boss ram can see what’s
going on and retain control more easily.
Mr. Bourke flatly denies that ewes
seek sex. All initial approaches are made
by the ram. However, after a ewe has
once been mounted by a ram she tends
to stick by him—for up to a day or
so, anyway.
Mating behaviour in sheep is by no
means a frivolous subject for close scru-
tiny. Better knowledge of it could per-
mit more profitable production. For
example, a dominant ram could be
infertile. If Mr. Bourke is correct, the
consequence in such a case would be
a low lambing percentage. Or a boss
ram may be less virile—as, in fact, Mr.
Bourke observed. One of the senior rams
in the group he studied took ewes away
from the junior ram and then would
not bother to serve them. Again, a boss
ram need not have the most desirable
genetic characters.
Cowra may be nearly 200 miles from
Prospect, where the CSIRO’s great
sheep research laboratory is located, but
it is scarcely too much to expect that
this Organisation and the Department
of Agriculture would get together and
sort things out rather than release con-
flicting and confusing results. Such co-
operation is vitally important as long
as we lack a self-sufficient extension
service.
Concerning drought feeding of sheep,
seemingly less controversial facts have
been derived from a co-operative study
between officers of the CSIRO and the
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture. Ex-
periments some years ago had made
clear that low-protein roughages are in-
adequate for lengthy drought feeding.
It is also known that even when supple-
mented with better-quality feedstuffs
sheep continue to die unless the nitrogen
content of the supplement exceeds a
certain minimum.
Thus, good results can be obtained
when the nitrogenous fertiliser, urea, is
added to drought rations of roughage.
Similarly, linseed meal, which is also
rich in nitrogen, allows sheep to survive
on very poor fodder even when pro-
vided very sparingly. Unfortunately,
linseed meal is often hard to obtain, and
urea is dangerous unless fed out very
carefully.
Lucerne hay, however, can usually be
bought at reasonable prices in the
pastoral areas and it contains plenty of
nitrogen. Accordingly, an experiment
was designed at the Glenfield Veterinary
Research Station to ascertain how much
of it should be added to a roughage
to provide a satisfactory maintenance
ration. Briefly, it was found that two-
tooth Merino wethers do well on chaffed
wheat straw and lucerne mixed in the
ratio two to one. A five to one mixture
is definitely not good enough. This
ration contains 5.2 percent crude pro-
tein. The former has 7.6 percent CP.
The experiment, which was run in
pens, also showed that the two feed-
stuffs should be offered well mixed.

Stopping Power
A lot of ads talk about power.
Stopping power seems to us to be more
vital.
The driver of this car had all the power to
get him where he wanted, probably
faster than he needed to.
But, at a critical moment, he didn’t have
the stopping power to avoid disaster.
A simple brake adjustment would have
made the difference. He would have
stopped and lived.
Next time you drive, make a critical test of
your stopping power. Don’t settle for a
“fair” performance.
If your brakes are not absolutely right, do
something about them.

The stopping power which he can restore
to you could save your life.

BOOKS
“A latter day Elizabethan
who never quite grew up”
By PETER COLEMAN
Mcrrison of Peking. Cyril Pearl. Angus
and Robertson. $6.95.
AT FIRST GLANCE a 400-page
biography of a “Times” foreign corres-
pondent may seem excessive, even to the
warmest admirers of journalists. But
“Chinese” Morrison—explorer, doctor,
“adviser” to the Chinese Republic, and
one of the most celebrated Australians
of his day—was no ordinary journalist.
It is extraordinary that he has not had
a decent biography before—either one
using his life as a peg on which to treat
some great theme such as the emergence
of China or Japan (which he covered
as a journalist) or one in a series on
Representative (one cannot say Great)
Edwardians—representing a time when
the Victorian creed of Race and Empire
still inspired spectacular feats by many
who did not see that the game was up.
Cyril Pearl in this biography mentions
these themes, but is not really interested
in them. His is the quarry type of
biography. He went through the Mit-
chell Library’s 255 boxes, volumes, and
packets of Morrison’s letters, tele-
grams, pawn-tickets; and he researched
in China, Japan, and England (where
Sir William Haley, of Morrison’s
employer “The Times,” “hindered me
by curtly refusing me access to its
archives ... I put this on record in
case any future student might seek the
co-operation of ‘The Times’”). In his
Preface he strikes the thematic note
and then hands out all the results of
his detailed research in chronological
order. But the quarry is a rich one and
the reader can pick and choose.
And what pickings. Before he settled
down as a journalist in Peking, he had
as a youth one-upped Burke and Wills,
21 years after their disaster, by walking
their route alone (2000 miles in 123
days); he had gone kanaka-hunting
(“nearly all the reading I did on board
was confined to Milton and the New
Testament and I honestly feel changed
much for the better”) and provoked an
inquiry into the traffic by a series of
exposures in the Melbourne Press —only
to be defamed for his pains by the
Queensland Premier Griffith, a future
Chief Justice, as a “very young man
who does not bear a high reputation”;
he had led a pioneering expedition into
New Guinea, graduated as a doctor in
Melbourne, worked as one in Spain and
Morocco, and walked from Shanghai to
Rangoon. Throughout this early period,
as well as later, he kept diaries, record-
ing physical, financial, sexual details.
His fame, however, is based on
Peking, where he worked for “The
Times from 1897 to 1912, when he
foolishly became “adviser” to Yuan
Shih-k’ai, first president of the Chinese
Republic. (How many other political
journalists have imagined they would
be better running the State than report-
ing it!) As “adviser” he was, inevitably,
a failure, and it may be a measure of
his understanding of China that he ever
thought he could be more than a front-
man or PR man for the Republic—
though this is the sort of question Pearl,
the quarry-man, does not explore. In
any case, Morrison was soon dis-
illusioned. (“Here I am paid nearly
£4OOO a year and kept in complete
ignorance” . . . and, pathetically, from
the apparent China expert: “These sus-
picious orientals, suspicious of each
other, especially suspicious of the
foreigner, are impossible people to
understand . . . This is a damned rotten
country to be in and a putrid people to
serve.”) He got, for his “advice,” the
Second-class Order of the Excellent
Crop.
Morrison’s real forte was reporting
the daily news in Peking, from the
Boxer Rebellion to the fall of the Man-
chus. If his stories do not always stand
up years later—how could they?—his
diaries fill them out with choice and
often scandalous detail. I especially
enjoyed his account of the Allied Occu-
pation of Peking after the Boxer Rebel-
lion—a simple case of why the Chinese
regard Europeans as barbarians
(although the Japanese plundered as
thoroughly as any). The British Minis-
ter at the Manchu Court and his wife
devoted themselves to looting (185
boxes of treasures) and the British offi-
cers formalised the orgy by compulsory
auctions of loot on a profit-sharing
basis. The Russians denuded the Sum-
mer Palace, raping women and murder-
ing men while they were about it. The
French were the most thorough thieves
and the Germans the most savage, but
they were only a few steps ahead of the
Spaniards, the Austrians, the Italians,
the Americans. Morrison himself got
Morrison in Yunnan, 1894, during a walk
across China. Photo, Mitchell Library
away with some jade and “gold things’
(while exposing the whole thing in “The
limes”). His diaries supplement the
reports: “Leitch says ‘I sent my servam
on a message. He was robbed by
Russian, buggered by a Frenchman,
killed by a German. In my dismay I
made complaint to a British officer. He
looked at me, put his eyeglass into his
eye, and said, ‘Was he really? What a
bore!’ ”
In his gloomier moments as Chinese
front-man he thought of entering Aus-
tralian politics. But while he always
remained Australian in sentiment and
lectured conscientiously during World
War I on the coming threat from our
then ally Japan, he really was out of
sympathy with the Lotus Land. “What
a shocking condition is Australia,” he
recorded on a 1917 visit after 15 years’
absence. “Disloyalty. Government by
the unfit. Drunkenness. Prostitution.”
Of Sydney: “What a laxity of public
decency, this appointment to two of the
highest offices in the State of a dis-
barred solicitor and public crook.” Of
Archbishop Mannix’s anti-conscription
campaign: “Very marked brogue. Poor
stuff, vulgar, and commonplace.”
And this is the enigma. Morrison was
a prodigious adventurer and prolific
writer (15 years as a journalist, 42 years
as a diarist) —who had little to say and
seems to have understood little of what
was going on around him. The fascina-
tion of his life as evidenced in this book
is what he reveals of his age rather
than what he understood. A boy won-
der, he was a boy to the end—fortu-
nately, a talkative one.

Sound assessments
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Landscape of Australian Poetry.
Brian Elliott. Cheshire. $7.50.
THE AUTHOR IS CONCERNED
with the process by which Australian
poets have assimilated their landscape.
A blending of scholarship and criticism,
it ranges over the whole of Australian
poetry from its beginnings to the late
’forties to become a repository of extra-
ordinary detail, out-of-the-way refer-
ences, and unusual pieces of information
as well as a skeleton history of Aus-
tralian verse.
Dr. Elliott has chosen a major theme
that needed full-scale treatment. As he
says: “So long as landscape remained
a phenomenon imperfectly understood,
it had bounded and circumscribed the
expression of all the poets. Whatever
their talent, they could not get outside
it. But as the young nation became
more sure of itself, and as social and
international forces operated to bring
out its independent spirit, its growing
sense of identity demanded that it
should rest more completely and un-
questionably upon its own spiritual
resources.”
Sections of the early part of Dr.
Elliott’s book must have involved much
rummaging in dead undergrowth; they
tell a story that needed telling. Much of
this part makes intentionally funny,
sometimes oddly fascinating, reading,
and the author is under no illusions that
he is dealing with writers, many of
whom are so negligible that respectable
words like “slight” and “minor” can
hardly be applied to them. They belong
to sociology rather than to literature,
but they give Dr. Elliott the chance to
make some pertinent remarks about the
relation of talent to its society. On
writers of some substance —Kendall,
Harpur, and O’Dowd —he has some
excellent new points to make. Swift
comparisons with American and
Canadian writers—like the later analo-
gies with painters—give the whole
added breadth of interest.
The book quickens considerably, to
my mind, from the 1920 s on (Brennan
is included at this point), when all
that is of most interest in Australian
poetry started to come to life. Dr.
Elliott has some ruthlessly relevant
comments on the “Vision” group
and especially on McCrae. His quick
impressionistic style can lead to
occasional glibness, but his patient
leisurely pages on the Jindyworobaks,
with their warmly sympathetic
account of Rex Ingamells are the
best yet written on the subject; and his
sound assessment of the Ern Mallev
affair ought to be taken as the last
word on that burnt-out case.
The validity of Dr. Elliott s


approach can be seen at its most per-
suasive in his comments on Hope,
where it enables him to make impor-
tant observations on the theme of
isolation, and elsewhere in his apercus
into imagery for instance those on
colonial Egyptian imagery.
There are, of course, points that one
wants to quibble at. In view of the
book’s concerns it is hard to account
for the omission of Furnley Maurice’s
“The Gully” (a poem Marianne Moore
was interested in, incidentally); and
difficult to fathom the relevance of the
comment on Fitzgerald’s “Moonlight
Acre.”
But this is a packed and extremelv
useful book. It will take its place with
Judith Wright’s “Preoccupations” and
the small but impressive body of essays
concerned with various aspects of the
contents of Australian poetry.
Paterson . . . man of his time
Paterson's prose
By NANCY KEESING
The World of “Banjo” Paterson.
Selected by Clement Semmler. Angus
and Robertson. $4.75.
YEARS AGO I addressed (I can’t
think why) a noisy gathering of Univer-
sity of Sydney students, one of whom
persistently and vociferously offered his
thesis that Australia could never have a
literature because none of our “popular”
writers had been war correspondents.
Hemingway was his god. I set up
Banjo ’ Paterson as local candidate for
this peculiar honor and, to my surprise,
the heckler immediately, and very
irrationally, subsided.
Obviously, there is little to compare
between Paterson and Hemingway
thank goodness for each of them. But
Paterson’s first-rate journalism has
always (even in his lifetime) been
eclipsed by his skill and popularity as
a balladist. It is, therefore, rewarding
to see tins large selection of the best of
his prose. It is enlightening, too—Pater-
son was very much a man of his time
his country, and his Empire. His assess-
ments of people, places, and events may
not be ours in 1967, but for this very
reason his interviews and articles con-
cerning “Chinese” Morrison, Kipling,
Olive Schreiner, Archibald, Allenby and
many others are intensely interesting.
Semmler includes stories, bush
sketches, interviews with people great
and humble, war dispatches, and sport
and racing articles. As Paterson’s only
full-length biographer, no one is better
qualified than Semmler for the making
of this book. It would be impossible to
dispute its range or fairness, and I can
imagine few readers who will not enjoy
Exploring Nabokov
By R. G. HOWARD
Escape into Aesthetics. The Art of
Vladimir Nabokov, Page Stegner.
Eyre and Spottiswoode. $4.25.
ANY REAL ATTEMPTS to critically
assess Nabokov’s work begin with this
book. Without necessarily approving the
current practice of dissecting authors
alive, one cannot help wondering why
Nabokov has been spared until now. In
part it may be that his own attitude to
critics, his self-protective bombardment,
to quote Stegner, of anyone who writes
about his work, has caused them to shy
away. On the other hand, the very
nature of his work, full as it is of pit-
falls in which a critic could lose his
reputation, has no doubt acted as a
deterrent.
Despite the dangers presented both
by author and his work, one intrepid
critic has at last dared to cross the
frontier into Nabokov territory, and it
is not altogether a case of fools rush in
where angels fear to tread. While one
might differ with Stegner on almost
every point of interpretation and while
his book contains its share of sheer
nonsense, the overall judgment of
Nabokov it offers can be fully endorsed.
“It is, perhaps, obvious,” he writes
summing up the man and the writer,
“that I think Nabokov a great writer,
and my tendency throughout has been
to spend little time pointing out his
evident faults—primarily because they
seem to me to have little to do with his
art. As a critic he is often arrogant and
intolerant . . . and he has adopted a
pose of supreme indifference to critical
opinion of his own work that I find
difficult to believe of any writer. But
he has written one, possibly two, great
books and a number of good ones . . .
It is, perhaps, through his characters
that an author most tellingly exhibits
his true sensibilities, and most of Nabo-
kov’s novels reveal a creator with con-
siderable feeling for human beings and
their comic absurdities.”
When it comes to the principal
thesis of the book it is not to easy to
agree with Stegner. He sees Nabokov
so repelled by the ugliness and horror
of reality that he tends to retreat into
an ivory tower constructed from art.
There may be a grain of truth in
his assertion, but it is hardly the key to
Nabokov’s fiction. Stegner, in fact, has
to do a great deal of distorting in the
attempt to fit each of the novels into
the template of his theory.
He makes frequent reference to
Nabokov’s hatred of the convention-
bound, unthinking approach to life,
without making clear that his books so
beautifully teach us to look at our sur-
roundings and our neighbors with
intentness, freshness, 1 and curiosity.
Nabokov has contrived to make his art
as enchanting as life can be. The most
important general point made in Steg-
ner’s book, following Mary McCarthy,
is that the conjuring tricks with words
and narrative method in the novels are
not irrelevant cleverness, but the genu-
ine expression of his view of life. Find-
ing nature full of illusions and decep-
tions, Nabokov has echoed this in Kls
art.
Stegner’s comments on the individual
novels offer some insight, for instance,
in pointing out the parallels between
“Bend Sinister,” and “Pnin,” but he is
also frankly derivative and sometimes
misguided. In trying to solve some of
Nabokov’s word games, he hobbles
behind the fleet-footed Miss McCarthy,
and much of what he says about
“Lolita” also, avowedly, follows,the lead
of fellow scholars.
But for all his faults, one feels his
heart is in the right place. There is a
fairly widespread belief that Nabokov
is ultimately a frivolous writer, not
worthy of serious consideration. “Escape
into Aesthetics,” though premature in
one sense, may be timely in another. It
takes for granted that Nabokov is not
only a serious waiter but a great one.

Asian migration
I enjoy' the pleasantly exasperated
tone in which Peter Samuel reviews the
recent symposium entitled “Asia's
Population Problems” (B. July 29), but
two comments seem to be called for.
First, to my mind he seriously under-
rates the papers by my fellow con-
tributors. I must not praise the work
of friends, but may I draw attention
to a valuable chapter, “Indonesia’s
Population Problem,” by Everett Haw-
kins? Beside me is an unsolicited
testimonial from a leading Australian
student of Indonesia, who writes that
the paper “is valuable, as I know of
none that is equally comprehensive and
sensible.”
Secondly, on the evidence of Gallup
Polls and many Press cuttings, Mr.
Samuel is mistaken in saying that the
case made in two of the chapters for
greater non-European migration to Aus-
tralia “is now thoroughly accepted.”
The number of Australians opposed to
any increase in the present inflow should
not be exaggerated, but neither should
it be underestimated. Hence the case
for reform must be made many more
than umpteen times, Samuel’s own ser-
vices being still needed and highly
valued in that regard. In particular, we
should realise the prevalence in Aus-
tralia of the understandable view that
the well-trained non-European can be
more use to the world if he stays in
his own country. That generalisation can
only be answered by spelling out in
detail the circumstances where it does
not apply, and it was here, principally,
that my chapter sought to break new
ground.
Kenneth Rivett
University of N.S.W.,

Peter Samuel is being excessively
naive when he chides Clunies Ross and
Kenneth Rivett for putting “once
again ’ the case for Australia taking
some Asian migrants (B. July 29).
It has been put “umpteen times be-
fore . . the case is unassailable, the
argument is now thoroughly accepted.
But I would venture to say that much
more is needed than “a trip to Can-
berra to point out to a small handful
of politicians and bureaucrats . . . that
there is no longer any opposition to
progressive change. . .”
There is a vast gulf between the
intellectual submission of the few and
the willingness of the many to back up
any such conviction with constructive
action. The “politicians and bureau-
crats of Canberra (and other places)
are more percipient and more aware
than Peter Samuel allows.

Je viens de prendre connaissance d’un
article publie sous le titre “The Freeze”
par The Bulletin du 5 aout 1967 et y
releve avec regret de graves erreurs
et une interpretation fort malveillante
de la position du Cambodge en regard
de ses frontieres. II m’apparait done
necessaire de clarifier une fois pour
toutes une question que certains milieux
etrangers tentent de rendre confuse.
II me faut d’abord preciser qu’il est
absolument faux que le Cambodge ait
revendique des parcelles des territoires
Thailandais, Vietnamien et Lao mais
que par contre les pretentions des
regimes de Saigon et de Bangkok aux
depens de l’integrite territoriale de notr e
pays sont bien une realite. C’est d’ail-
leurs compte tenu de cette realite que
le Gouvernement Royal a demande a
tousles pays du monde une declaration
qui confirmerait le gel et l’intangibilite
des frontieres Cambodgiennes actuelles.
De nombreux pays amis ont repondu a
cet appel. Les uns ont proclame leur re-
connaissance desdites frontieres et
d autres mention de leur simple respect.
Mais le Gouvernement Australien ete le
seul a preciser que ce respect n’impli-
quait nullement la reconnaissance du
trace des frontieres Cambodgiennes.
Le caractere illogique et contradic-
toire des reserves Australiennes a ainsi
contraint le Gouvernement Royal a
demander a tousles pays une precision
supplementaire quant a la reconnais-
sance des frontieres actuelles du Cam-
bodge. La seule exception concerne la
France qui est juridiquement respon-
sable de leur trace. Or si la Chine vient
de donner satisfaction a cette nouvelle
demande l’Australie pour sa part main-
tient que les frontieres Khmeres ne sont
ni definies ni delimitees.
Votre journal nous informe que le
Gouvernement Australien ne fera pro-
bablement pas de compromis pour ne
pas risquer d’offenser les regimes de
Saigon et de Bangkok et affirme que
“c’est maintenant a Sihanouk de
decider.” En retour je vous informe
que le Gouvernement Royal n’acceptera
aucun compromis avec l’Australie ou
tout autre pays qui entendrait laisser
une porte aux visees expansion-
nistes des voisins du Cambodge. Nous
ne demandons que la justice et il appar-
tient au Gouvernement Australien de
decider souverainement si son interet
est de cautionner ouvertement ou tacti-
quement la loi de la jungle adoptee par
nos ennemis.
