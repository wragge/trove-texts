THE RED PAGE.
In the matter of Bums, George Black
continues—
Your critic ingeniously says ‘ Burns never
claimed credit for many of the verses which his
Eulogists attribute to him. If heyiid, he might
have claimed credit for a Clean-Steal tike the
Dusty Millet*” ’
' t! 1 * 8 s^’P‘B h°d stuff has any meaning, it is
that Burnsdid not use the ‘Dusty Miller * as his
own Nevertheless, it.is styled a ‘Clean-Steal.’
uex t • The faets are that Burns re-wrote
the first stanza of the * Miller nmefa improving
it—and added tlierewi an entirely new verse. He
did not sign it, and, in tbie notes to his poems, this
information ib gi-ven. Consequently, only the
most superficial of Burns’ admirers could view the
Dusty Miller’ as ‘an egg of genius that only
Burns nwiul.could lay.’ There are minds that lay
other varieties of eggs- the egg of innuendo, of
misrepresentation, of suppression, of absolute un-
truth 1
* • * *
Red Page also asserts that: “ The two beat lines
ui Scots Wha Hae ’ are not Burns’; ‘ Auld Lang
Syne ’ is not Burns’ ; ‘ Cornin’ Thro’ the Ry e > i 8
not Burns’; ‘My Love is Like the Red, Red
Rose ’ is not Burns’. ”
Of ‘Seots Wha Hae.,’ Burns says: “I have
borrowed the last stanza from the' common-stall
edition of Wallace—
* A_false usurper sinks in every foe,
AudLiberty returns with every blow.’ ”
Your critic is too eager to injure Burns. None,
but those willing to be misled, will dream that the
lines quoted are equal to Burns’ version of them.
Nor are they, even after being subjected to his
polish, in my opinion, superior to any other two
out of the twenty-four lines that go to make up
the song.
* * * *
You fully quote ‘ My Luve is Like ’ in order to
prove that Burns had'ho fire of« his own, and
firphtd the poetic flame. •In Cunningham’s edi-
tion it is.admitted that this was a paraphrase of
an oldiNitlis’dale song. The first verse was little
improved by Burns. The two other verses
Xou quoted first appeared «in a chap-book
(1792},,. and if the poet had no hand in
putting them there, then > only the verse
beginning ‘As fair art Thou, My Bonnie Lass ’
can be* wholly attributed to him. -But Burns’
patchwork lives as he left it always never as he
foutfd jt, and Henley is forced to style ‘ My Luve
is Like,’ a ‘mosaic of rather beggarly scraps of
English verse, ... exquisitely done, of course.’
be no clean-steal which Burns never
olaimed ; at most, ft is'a vamp.
_ * * * •
Henley does, not quote anything as a probable
source of inspiration for Burns which remotely
resembles ‘ Cornin’ thro’ the Rye.’ Cunningham
«*y| 'Bu»ns*took tihe old strain . . thrashed
loose chaff from about it, and sent it
to the ‘ Museum.’ / He quotes a verse of the ‘old
strain,’ whose style, and particularly its use of
the word ‘ gloom?’ leads,me'to think it post-dates
Burns. No evidence exists to justl fy the assertion
that 4 Cornin’ thrbugh the Rye ’ is not*Burns*.
Henley s notes on ‘ Auld Lang Syne’ are b
little-more complete t'han those of‘ Cunningham
iSurns said thait the lines he unproved had ney
been even m manuscript until be took them daw
irons the singing of an old man. In styling this
derived song ’ for onoe yon are right. Whe
you say it_is not Burns!, you err and eontradi
yourself. lour ©f tte nve verses are wholly his
the first verse and the chords—inspired, withou
doulit, by the lines yqji quoted on Bfec. 4th—ar
immeasurably superior to the originals. In fact
only an'enthusiast, oompetent to &eh latent po^
hihties e.wwftl write, as did Burns t« Mrs. Dm
lop Light lie the turf on the breast of tl
haaven-mspired poet who* composed this gloriou
fragment.’
* * * «
„.° n , , 4tt ' Dec., you quote with approval ‘
VVaukin as an example of the old Ballad diamond
lhe quotation does not uphold your case. Of it
sixteen lines at least twelve—aecording to Henle
(who styles it ‘a masterpieee by Burns’) anc
T, re Durnsbowß. 'ihie lines you juxtapose
When Braving Angry Winter’s Storms,’ as a
example of the Bums’ paste, are in his very w.ors
style. It is palpably untrue that it is his • typica
Very Own.’ He says himself: ‘Theee Englis
songs gravel me to death. I have not the com
mand of the language that I have of my nativ
ongue. In fact, I think that my ideas are mor
barren m English than in Scottish.’ Your critic’
devices for the discrediting of Burns are certainly
ingenious. Are they honest? By the way
Henley does not assert that Burns filched any o
the verses ‘The Bulletin’ sets down as clean
stolen. His words are: ‘Burns had a lead.
Derived is, therefore, the term.
• • • •
On Deo. 4th you said ‘The clean-steal class
slides imperceptibly into the neat vamp, in which
Burns contributes so much to the construotioi
that the product is practically a new song. ’ Never-
theless, a little further on you insinuate that thp
E, lie, and especially ‘the average Scotchman,
ave been deoei ved too long by a reputation which
is legendary and Scottish,’ and throughout the
pervading idea is that Burns should be expur-
gated of the Neat-Vamps (the ‘ practically new
songs’) as well as the Clean Steals. The gross
contradiction of the two positions—likely to
escape a careless reader—is now made evident to
all. Another contradiction :In one place you sa\
that Bwrns is credited with 108 songs which are
neat-vamps ; further down, in the table, you oredil
him with 108 Neat-Vamps and Derivatiyes wher
bunched together. Starting out to take away i
man s reputation, you ought to at least to make
some appearance of accuracy. You also said that
among the vamps must be included ‘The Birks ol
Aberfeldie,’ ‘Macpherson’s Farewell,’ ‘For our
Rightful King,’ ‘The Siller Tassie,’ ‘John Ander-
son, My Jo.’ The man who would call ‘The
Birks of Aberfeldy ’ a vamp is either cursed with
literary opthalmia or is guilty of deliberate false
testimony. It has five verses—all Burns’ ‘very
own,’ and he only ‘ vamped ’ the chorus from that
of an old song. Therein it ran thus—
‘ O bonnie lassie, wilt thou fro
To fhe birks of Abergeldy ? ’
Therefore, the extent of Burns’ indebtedness is two
lines of very matter-of-fact entreaty. Further
the chorus has had so little influence on Burns’
song as not to qualify it for the derivative class.
• * * *
Of the 24 lines that make up ‘ Macpherson’s
Lament,’ three are borrowed, but none of the
others, in spirit or in language, owe anything to
the old baHad.
* • * •
Henley says of ‘ A’ for our Rightful King,’ that
Buchan, w!k> attributed it to Captain Ogilvie, was
‘ still bent on fathering everything on somebody
—a line ‘The Bulletin’s’ Red Page might with
advantage cctfntnifc to memory. There is nothing
in the line I must go fight for My King’ to sug-
gest It was a’for our Rightful King’; and*of
Burns 30 lines, none of the others owe anything
to ‘ Mally Stewart,’ except his third verse, which
has been taken from the old poem almost verbatim
and, Henley, ‘ set in a jewel of Eurasian
gold. Cunningham acknowledged the loan.
* * • .
Usually known as ‘My Bonnie Mary,’ ‘The
Siller Tass-ie,’ without doubt, owes 14, if not 15,
of its 16 lines to Burns. The poet told the pub-
116her that he took the fifst half-stanza from an
old ballad. The borrowed lines or line hardly
©ontain the motive of the song; which can never
be honestly calle’d a vamp. It does not look
as if your sparrow-hawk were going to get away
with even one chicken out of Burns’ clutch.
* * * *
Of John Anderson, My Jo,’ 16 lines are printed
m the ordinary editions, but there are eight others
in existence which Burns left out, because they
had not tii© pathos of the linos r©tain©d.
As a matter of fact, Burns borrowed nothing from
the g@ne : before but the refrain of five words
‘ John Andersen, my Jo John.’ So, where the
vamp theory has a rightful footing none but a Red
Page may say. Is the Page too red to raise a
blush ?
* * * »
Burns never claimed ‘ O were my love’; which
you have placed in his list of vamps. In the
Cunningham edition, ‘the 'average Scotchman ’
has been supplied for over sixty years with reli-
able information as to what is Burns’ a«d what i-s
not. On pa'ge 84 of the V. volume, in a letter to
Thomson, it is stated bv Burns that, in order to
eke out a song to the air ‘Hughie Graham,’ he
had added eight lines to an ‘inexpressibly beauti-
ful fragment ’ taken from Witherspoon’s Scottish
Collection. The eight lines beginning ‘Oh, were
my Love yon Lilac Fair’ are wholly Burns’; the
eight lines which commence ‘Oh, gin iny Love
were yon Red Rase,’ belong to some gifted Un-
known whose muse Bufns has slightly assisted.
The whole line of attack suggests a grimy little
boy trying to kic-lc down the wall of an impreg-
nable fortress.
» * * *
It is not necessary to further follow the tortuous
track of yosr reviewer. One would almost flunk
that, in consultation with the editor, he began by
saying : ‘ Gr. H. Reid is a Scotty : let us down
Burns to discredit his fiscal policy ! ’ However,
let me sa-y that the Red Page attacks on Burns—
especially the first—were apparently built up by
two men. One iknew something of his subject,
occasionally saw all sides of it, and was inclined
to he just. The ®t'her simply strove t© be clever,
and eared not how far he strayed from facts in
his efforts after the unattainable. If not the
result of a partnership, then the page of 25th Oct.
is the work of a dual-minded journalistic Jckyll-
and-Hyde.
* * * *
I have already shown some contradictions ; here
are others. In several places the Scotch are
damned as an unpoetical and unimaginative race
—this, in order to discredit the Burns of whom
they think so much. In another place, again
for the purpose of discrediting Burns, the aneient
Sootoh song-writers are thus lauded :
The sincerity, the ring, the intensity (either of humor
or pathos), the charm and the power, these are always the
property of the rough, so-joyous, so-sad old rhymers
(Scbtch) from whom the song-Burns borrowed. Often his
sympathy gave their work a better form, but thefrs was
the living fire. . . . The divine fire that those earlier
Titans (Seotch) stole from Heaven.
• * « »
These are peculiar terms to use in describing an
unpoetioal race ! But there are other contradic-
tions. In several instances, Henley is congratu-
lated on his production of a book whose revelations
unmask the impostor who has been so long mas-
querading as a poet. But in another place it
is calmly stated that * It has always been known
or guessed that Burnt was scarcely ever a com-
pletely original writer.’ One statement negatives
the other ; neither is correct. Henley’s so-called
revelations have been common property for over a
century.
• * * *
Ijet me parallel a few Red Page contradictions :
‘By dint of his versatile ‘Burns fits his unimagina-
energy Burns summed up tive countrymen and they
and excelled the achieve- fit him. He inspires a
ments of a dozen poets, on Scotchman less because he

Certainly no one will ever aecuse your re-
viewer of inability to ‘soar far from his facts ’; or
indeed out of sight of them. Albeit, not tether-ed,
in this matter he assumes somewhat the com-
plexion of a goat.
* * * *
Loath to begin, my case ie so strong that I a*n
loath to leave off, but let me say of tIW New Ctrlt
in Criticism that it is unhealthy; it reeks of
misetable conceits, and savors of cant and trickery.
It presents to us the statement that Burn's had
too healthy a body to be a first-class poet—Henley
says his health was ruined by overwork as a
growing boy—and that good writing is the pro-
duct of a diseased brain, arfd a disordered liver.
I will admit that this hypothesis may account for
the remarkably ‘good writing ’ seen on the Red
kut it is not borne out by general results.
Ibis brings me to an extraordinary statement from
Henley which ‘ The Bulletin ’ applauds
A lyrical idea-by which I mean a rhythm, a burden,
and a drift—once found, the song writes itself. It writes
itself easily or with difficulty, it writes itself well or-itl,
but in the end it writes Itself.
Herein, Mr. Henley easily writes himself down
an ass. Ihe difference between the ‘ lyrical idea ’
vyhich writes songs easily and weH, and the
Jynca l idea’ which writes songs with diffioulty
and ill, is to be found in the difference between
the men at the end of the respective pens If the
lyrical idea alone did the work, then the completed
song eould never, by any mischance, be ill. One
thing is certain : Take ‘the lyrical idea ’ of any
song that Burns ever wrote of any value and
place it m the hands of Henley,.and all ‘ The
Bulletin bards that ever spoiled clean paper, and
I will engage that in everything which goes to
make a lyric, Burns ; is easily first and the rest
nowhere. But ‘The Bulletin’s’ review of Hen-
ley s Burns is simply a peg on which to hang an
attack on the poet and his countrymen, *lt is
almost as unfair to Henley as it is to Burns • for
there is qothing in Henley’s criticisms, cfrnotes or
alleged discoveries, which warrants the savagery
of your onslaught. Henley says of Burns
He is an amazing compound of style and sentiment with
gaiety and sympathy, of wit and tenderness wkhladiant
humor and an admirable sense of art. . . . He had more
genius, and genius of a finer, a rarer, and more generous
quality than all liis.immediate predecessors put together.
He wrote masterpiece after masterpiece with a rapSiity,
an assurance, a command of means, a brilliancy of “fSfeafc,
wh'ich makes his achievement one of the most I remarkiahle
in English letters. . . . Burns, among the general at
least, is better sung than read. But if his songs he the
more national, the Poems are the greater, and it is chiefly
to the Poems that Burns is indented for his place in
literature.
* * * .
Let this quotation from Henley be my last
word —
In the sequel, Burns is found to have a place of his own
in the first flight of E itrWsh poets after Milton, Chancer,
and Sha'kh-p are. . . . Burns, the amazing peasant o!
genius, the inspired faun, whose voice has gone ringing
through the court's of Time these hundred
more, and is far louder, far clearer now than when it first
broke on the ear of man.
[Parts of this are self-answered ; parts involve detail
comparisons for which readers must be the
tons et origo mali, Henley’s ‘Burns’; parts may he
handled later. One explanatory word meantime. The
object of the R.P. is to give rather stimulus than state-
ment. For the attempt (even) at presentation of wholes,
four curtailed columns and one hurried newspaper-person
don’t suffice. In the matter of Tennyson, for example,
there was as much to be said on the other side:
but it had all been said already. That side
had not been said already; and it badly wanted
saying. So with Burns. His other side had been said
already ; but it had been suppressed, overlain, forgotten,
and clamored to be said again. Also : Good readers read
with brains and sympathy—express the unexpressed, com-
plete the unfinished, make some allowance, too, for the
utter incapacity of words to portray ideas, no matter how
one tries. From no single Red Page can a final deduction
be drawn: even a synthesis of Pages made by amiableminds
will doubtfully yield the wished-for conclusion. But one
does what one can, and tries what one can’t. That the
R.P. endeavors to be impartial, George Black, with his
* journalistic JekyH-and-Hyde ’ (same fellow, of course)
bears gratifying witness. That means that heredity,
training, patriotism, prevented him from seeing both sides
of the shield. And one word more. Take apVesent-day
writer of Australian verse—Henry Lawson. What should
we say of him if his apologists had to admit that this
poem he borrowed, yonder one was half-written by an-
ether hand, for the idea and swing of a third h"e was
indebted to some obs 'tire bush hard whose MS. he edited ?
Would he still be the Henry Lawson that we knew and
admire? And if 100 editions of his poems had been putin
circulation, containing a body of songs of which a full
half contained traces, or fragments, or substantial wholes
of other men’s work—born of their brains, not his;
nourished by their inspiration, not his; roughly, if in-
artistically, completed by their hands, not his—and if
these 10@ editions were title -paged as ‘by Henry
Lawson,’ and gave not one clue to the real author-
ship of the oonveyed items, not one word to indi-
cate that Lawson was getting credit, and praise, and
world-wide reputation for ether men’s work —then would
not every Australian rise and expose the despoiler? And
cannot Scotchmen, in similar ease, do as much for Burns?
It does not matter what Burns admitted, or what some of
his editors partially admit in expensive editions.unread
by the majority. To every man Burns is just what that
man conceives him to be, and if there is room for one
reader to misconceive tthe authorship of one poem attri-
buted to Burns, then to that extent it is the duty of
Honest Literature to denounce and destroy— not the real
Burns but—the popular Burns, the Burns myth, the
ridiculous monstrosity slavered and belauded at Scottish
clubs and centenary celebrations.]
Writes Paris Nesbitt —
Let me atjd my opinion to that of the Local Dogmatist.
Except as to plagiarism, with regard to which I rather
agree with George Black—holdingthai the poet(fesfamtur
Mirabeau and Watson) may gather leaves from every tree
—I concur with the L.D.’s estimate of Burns. Matthew
Arnold’s summary, ‘A beast, with splendid gleams,’
smacks perhaps a little too hard of what my friend Hugh
Gilmore sailed • the superior pairson ’ ; but it is not far
from the truth.—. This from.the Refractory Ward, Lunatic

JUST A WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You ask me why I lovedie-r ;
Not a ohatm oa-n you discover.
Would yen see
The heart Chat a shut rose la,
And whose beauty ae’er unclose*
Save for me ?
She is not rich or eleven,
But’her speeches thrill me ever;
with bliss
My heart at her tones Sutters,
Though the wisest wovd she utters
Is a kiss!
All evil things have shunned her,
Aaid with a w-ide-eyed wonder
Is'she tasked,
What lavish god has given
In her earth so unToh of heaven
All unaskeeb?.
She has no gifts or graces,
But the gladness in her face is
Sought of kings;
She cannot ohant a measure,
But her heart with a grave pleasure
fiver sings.
Though her gown is of the whitest
The hem is-soiled the slightest:
Little worth,
She has no wings to,fly with,
And she prefers to hie with
Me on earth.
There is no hint of heaven,
Or glimpse of deep thought even.
In her eyes ;
She is warm and she is human,
Just a weak and willing woman—
Not too wise.
Her thousand beauties singing,
I have not said how clinging
Are her arms—\
But—not loved and not the lover—
Dare you ever hope discover
Half her charms ?

SURGEON LANGSTON, M.R.C.S., Eng.,
THE GREATEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL PRACTI-
TIONER IN THE WORLD.
But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emin-
ence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has .become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other nWn you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed
in an acute or chronic case of long standing, where other
physicians have failed. He addresses himself in particular
to cases that have baffled the skill and science of other
doctors. His name is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect
cure of every case he undertakes. Consult him this day.
It may save you much mental and physical suffering, and
add golden years to your life.
YOUNG MEN. You will find this distinguished doctor
your best friend and benefactor. If you are troubled
with want of sleep, a tired, gloomy feeling, and loss
of energy, which impair both your body and brain,
and absolutely unfit you for study, business, or the
proper enjoyment of life; if you are suffering from these
or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE- AG ED MEN. There are many of you afflicted
with weak, aching back and kidneys, loss of mental and
physical power and vigor, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated
that in all such cases of middle-aged men, as well of
young men, his success has been almost invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female com-
plaints, liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder,
kidney and heart disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele
and kidney troubles.
VARICOCELE. Surgeon Langston's Electric Quadrant
with double compress, price £2. Constitutional or
acquired weaknesses treated successfully.
CONSULTATION is free to all, but where £1 is
enclosed a careful diagnosis of the case will be made, and
appropriate medicines sent. Before confiding your case
elsewhere, consult the old and successful Specialist,
SURGEON LANGSTON. A friendly letter or call may
save future suffering. New edition of my latest work,
“Mens Sana in Corpore Sano,” nearly 100 pages, sent free
to men. N.B.—The only Qualified Surgeon practising as
a Specialist who has held Government Appointments.

without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms

Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN
DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickesn
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely:—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, Ac.,
&c.. should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

skin diseases may be quickly and permanently

common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.

opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send fid. in

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
arid immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and iiri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
•‘After suffering from Asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cured me, and
I nave much pleasure in recommending it. —ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
"We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by

A drunken Gordon Highlander recently
broke into an English village church at 2 a.m..
and had a high old time ringing the bell and
strumming on the harmonium, till the alarmed
population carried him by assault in its nightshirt
and ran him in. “The Gay Gordons” again !
Brisb. Tramway co., piloted by an aggres-
sive Yankee engineer, demands permission to
drive its electric cars through the main streets at
from 15 to 22 miles per hour (10 miles over cross-
ings). Rapid transit means fewer cars and less
expense all round. Bulletin suggests that, if
Transit Commission agrees, it should be clearly
understood that the co. must stand the racket
when the big smash comes off.
Coromandel Sun (Maoriland) pegged out
the other day. Its last issue was printed in
crimson ink as a sign that its orb was low down
on the western horizon. In a bright-red obituary
notice the editor briefly farewelled thus : “ The
Sun, which for two years has thrown its radianc*-
across Coromandel, ceases to exist. It shuts
down. It closes up the show. It perishes as th-
flower by the wayside. It dies without funk and
without prejudice.” Then he solemnly slopped
it on to the local authorities for the last time for
not lighting the wharf, in consequence of which
five people had fallen overboard in twelve months,
and after that he locked the front door and gave
up the ghost.
A horrible story of a woman who was “ in
trouble ” has partly leaked out in Maoriland. It j
was the usual kind of trouble and she wanted to i
get out of it in the usual kind of way to save her
orthodox respectability. She couldn’t make ud
her mind to explain things to a doctor, so _sb- i
fersuaded a female friend to perform an operation i
n their colossal ignorance the operation Vra- j
apparently performed with a knife and fork—th- '
amateur operator, with the best intentions anr:
magnificent nerve and an amazing ignorance of
anatomy, seems to have sawed her friend open. !
There was a funeral shortly afterwards, and' th-
victim’s reputation was saved, anyhow.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their i
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on pag-
-27 of this issue.*

Deep hid by virgin branch and bole,
With new-born leaves their bed I made,
And buried there with them my soul.
And lingered long around and turned,
With heavy heart, my feet away ;
Blood-red, to west the sunset burned,
And Night came in with shadows gray.
Beside my path a river flowed
To seaward, from the mountains down ;
From crest to crest where went the road
I saw the garish glare of town.
And phantom voices filled the air
That made the blood within me start,
And phantom shapes with bosoms bare
Revived the hunger of my heart.
But I went on, f»r well I knew,
Than these things, better dust and drouth :
Beside my way the phantoms flew,
Their phantom kisses on my mouth.
And one had eyes that warmed the blood,
And one had lips with passion wet,
And one had breasts that never bud
The summer blew could rival yet.
The heart within me turned to fire,
The blood within me molten hot,
The hounds of passion and desire
Were loosed in me, and I forgot—
Forgot the two I laid to rest
What time the sunset gathered red,
The one with lilies on her breast,
The other, laurels on her head.
FRAMCIS KENNA.
THE INVESTIGATORS.
In Deep o’ Dreams I heard a hammer beating
nigh,
From Deep o’ Dreams I rose with sudden, startled
cry.
Men nailed a coffin-lid a-down with direful din,
The corpse of gentle Joy lay deadly calm within.
They placed that coffin cold upon this heart of
mine—
(Pray God such burden grim be never laid on
thine !)
In anguish deep I turned —I prayed, and wept,
and pled :
“ Take off this load,” I cried, “ and give me Death
instead! ”
They gazed upon my face with cold enquiring air—
“We fain would learn, O fool, what human hearts
can bear.”
And all impassive then they turned on ready heel
And graved on brazen plate with cunning style of
steel:
“ Though crushed by cruel load, though struck by
direst ill,
The broken heart a-sob in life will linger still.”

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1898.
Slow Progress.
The Federal Constitution gets on slowly, and
a good deal of its progress is sideways. Also,
a good deal of the progress which isn’t side-
ways is endways instead. Still it does pro-
gress with a loud and violent crawl, and after
a certain fashion. So far as things have
gone this season, the river-control question
has been dealt with, and a definite resolution
has been arrived at to give up trying to
arrive at any definite resolution whatsoever.
In other words, the river problem has been
practically left to the Federal Parliament,
without anybody knowing for certain whether
the Federal Parliament has power to deal
with it or not. Still, as the Federal Parlia-
ment will probably, in the end, manage to
get whateverpporerw r er is absolutely necessary,
it will presumably get over the difficulty
somehow. The question of railway control
and the public-debts problem have both been
left over in like manner. It seems to be
agreed that these subjects will be re-opened
and talked to death again before the
present session ends, . but the inevitable
result, so far as appears up to date, is that
they will be also left unsettled with a
general understanding that they will
come out all right somehow, some time in the
future. In any case, the Federal Parlia-
ment, whatever it does with them, can’t
make them much more wrong than they are
at present. And a fearful and wonderful
scheme of Federal finance has been drawn
up by the committee over which Premier
Reid presided, which scheme appears, at
time of writing, to have a fair prospect of
acceptance. Considering how consistently the
Convention has shirked all serious difficul-
ties up to date, the prospect of it definitely
accepting anything has its advantages.
* * * *
The new financial plan is a heroic effort to
please everybody, and it gets as near there
as could reasonably be expected. The Com-
monwealth Parliament is to enact a uniform
tariff inside of two years from the date of its
establishment. If the deadlock gets so bad
that it doesn’t manage to get its uniform
tariff established inside two years (and as no
remedy for deadlocks is provided this is just
possible) the Constitution doesn’t say what
is to happen, but the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment will have to get over that difficulty
somehow. For five years after the uniform
tariff is established quite a number of diffi-
cult or nearly impossible things are to happen.
Each State is to be debited with its own
share of the Federal expenditure charged
on a population basis. Each State is also to
be credited with the amount of customs and
excise duties collected within its borders,
and, after its share of the Federal ex-
penses has been deducted, is to receive
back the remainder subject to certain
mixed and complicated conditions. If goods
are imported and duty is paid upon them at
Melbourne, that duty will, in the first place,
be regarded as part of the Victorian contri-
bution to the Federal revenue and credited
accordingly. If the same goods are after-
wards sent across to New South Wales,
account shall be taken of them at the border,
if they can be identified, and the duty origin-
ally paid upon them and credited to Victoria
shall be debited to Victoria again, and
credited to New South Wales. This is per-
fectly fair and honest, though a trifle cum-
bersome. It represents a vast amount of
labor and ink, but at the worst the system
is to last for five years only, after which time
the Federal Legislature may make any new
arrangement that it thinks fit.
* * * *
Westralia is by far the largest consumer
of imported goods in proportion to its
population, and will, for the first year
or two, lose far more by the abolition of
interprovincial tariffs than any other State
of the union. Therefore, to save it from
insolvency, another hideously complicated
proviso is inserted. As already mentioned,
a record is to be kept of the amount each
State contributes to the Federal Treasury by
customs duties on goods imported into the
State for its own consumption. In addition, a
fearfully intricate record is to be kept of the
amount each State would have raised by
customs duties on the same goods if its old
provincial tariff were in force instead of the
Federal tariff. The difference between the
amount in customs duties each State raises
under the Federal tariff, and the amount it
would have raised under its own tariff suppos-
ing it had used the same quantity of goods, is
to be accurately arrived at; also, the average
amount of this difference per inhabitant.
And if it proves that Westralia is losing more
revenue per inhabitant by the new tariff
than the average loss per inhabitant of
the other four provinces, it is to re-
ceive from them a contribution which will
make its average loss of revenue per inhabit-
ant no greater than the average loss (per in-
habitant) of the other provinces. This
terrific arrangement will probably drive a
good many Treasury officials into the lunatic
asylum, and it is a truly fearsome thing to
read about ; still, if Westi’alia will come in on
these terms and on no others, there seems no
serious objection to Westralia getting these
terms.
* • * *
There is no possible doubt that Westralia,
with few manufactures and little agriculture
and an altogether abnormal dependence on
imports, will supply for a while far more
than its fair share of the Federal customs
revenue. The proposed clumsy arrangement
looks as if it would make things reasonably
level in its own clumsy way—provided it
doesn’t break down utterly in practice. If
it does break down the Federal Legislature
must find a way out. In any case the
elaborate book-keeping process and the
possible necessity for small contributions by
the other States to keep Westralia afloat, are
only to last for five years, and at the end of
that period the Federal Legislature, with five
years’ experience to guide it, may devise some
simple and comprehensive fiscal system of a
permanent character. It will be Australia’s
own fault if it doesn’t. Even if the book-
keeping horror was to last for fifty years
instead of five, it would be a very moderate
price to pay for the making of an Australian
nation. The benefits of Federation will
belong to the community at large, while the
financial complications necessary to arrive at
these benefits will only kill a few book-
keepers and a Treasurer or two at the
worst. Considering all things, the price
seems moderate.
* * '* *
If the new fiscal scheme devised by Premier
Reid and his fellow - committeemen be
adopted, it will be one of the most satis-
factory things which the Convention has
accomplished up to date. Supposing it
does prove a huge blunder, there will be a
complete revision about lfi'Kl, when things
can be put right in the light of new experi-
ence, and, as Federation will have been
secured in the meantime, the blunder can’t
be so huge as to outweigh the advantage
gained. There must necessarily be many
mistakes in the course of so vast
an experiment as the making of an
entirely new Constitution under an almost
entirely new set of conditions. The one
essential is that there should be some con-
venient method provided whereby these
mistakes can be put right when they are
discovered; so long as there ai’e sufficient
facilities for repairing the Constitution when
experience brings its weak spots to light, it
matters comparatively little how defective it
is to start with. So far as concerns the
financial aspect of the case, the proviso which
makes a complete revision possible at the
end of five years covers nearly every sin
which could be committed in the course of
the preliminary experiments. The pity is
that the Constitution, so far as it has been
devised, though elastic enough on this point,
isn’t nearly so elastic otherwise. The general
tendency seems to be towards an arrange-
ment under which it can only be amended
on the vote of an absolute majority of both
Houses of the Federal Legislature, and the
separate approval of a majority of the elec-
tors voting at a national referendum; also,
the proposed change must be carried
by a majority of the separate States.
This makes the road to any future
repair of the Constitution tolerably rocky,
inasmuch as it provides that a reform
which is urgently demanded by both Houses
of the Federal Legislature, and endorsed by
an overwhelming majority of the people, may
still be rejected if the three least-populous
States give the smallest kind of a majority
apiece against it. Still, even this proviso
doesn’t absolutely block the way to reform
in the future, and if nothing more liberal
can be arrived at, the proposition is good
enough to pass muster.
* * * *
One thing which is growing more and
more evident, is that the Federal Parlia-
ment will have to find its own way out of
most of its difficulties. The Convention is
too hopelessly at variance to settle many
things definitely. As matters stand, it seems
that, should deadlocks grow too frequent
between the two Houses of the Federal
Parliament, they will have to devise some
remedy for deadlocks between themselves.
If the divided river control becomes impos-
sible through one or more provinces grab-
bing more than their share of the water-
supply for irrigation purposes, and leaving
their next neighbor dry, the Commonwealth
Legislature will have to construct some law
which will meet the case. If the differential
railway tariffs interfere with trade or give
undue preference to one port over another,
it will have to find a remedy for this also,
the Convention having practically given it up.
The financial problem is to come back on the
hands of the Central Government five years
hence. In short, the Convention, apparently
without knowing it, is drifting more or less
into the position advocated by Samuel
Griffith when he offered the very wise sug-
gestion that Australia should trust its own
Federal Parliament, elected by its own
people, to be as honest as the average pro-
vincial Parliament, and give it the same lati-
tude. After all, what else can Australia do ?
To Slattery and Others.
The remnant of the Cabbage-tree Mob has
risen to announce that it will do all it knows to
prevent any Federation unless N.B. Wales
receives a special bribe by the establishment of
the Federal capital in its territory. Attorney
Slattery states hysterically that “ we,” there-
by meaning N.S.W., are “being laughed out
of our rights to demand, as a condition prece-
dent to Federation, that the city of Sydney
shall be fixed as the seat of Government.”
N.S.W. is thus outraged, in the opinion of
Slattery, because it has been decided to leave
the fixing of the capital to the Federal Parlia-
ment, in which N.S.W. will have a bigger vote
than any other province. The desperately
narrow and dreary Lyne has demanded in the
Federal Convention that the consent of his
province to the making of an Australian nation
shall be bought by the placing of the capital in
Cornstalk territory. The equally parochial Pre-
mier Reid made the same demand, and slander-
ously alleged, in effect, that his mercenary pro-
vince wanted to be bought over by the vulgar
process of tip. According to Reid (also Lyne
and the Cabbage-tree Mob in general) N.S. W. is
entitled to demand the Federal capital as a
matter of right. Also, it is entitled to demand
it because, in the words of Premier Reid,
“N.S.W. will have to bear the main burden of
Federation,” and because the possession of the
capital will be only a moderate compensation
for the great sacrifices it is making on behalf
of the other provinces. Just here The Bulle-
tin reckons it might assist materially in bring-
ing about a settlement of the difficulty if this
little band of windy provincial bigots would
explain what are these alleged special sacri-
fices which N.S.W. is making, and how it will
bear more of the “ burden ” than any other
province ; and what right it has to any special
consideration beyond what its voting-power in
the Federal Parliament and its contribution to
the Federal revenue will give it ? No other
province has put forward such extraordinary
claims to be the large tin-god among the
federated States, and the Cabbage-tree Mob
should give some coherent reason for its alleged
rights. The mere assertion of Lyne and Reid
and T. Slattery that the rights are self-evident
is insufficient.
* * * #
One frequent argument advanced in this
matter is that N.S.W. has special rights as the
“ mother-province ” of Australia, but this
theory is a legend with very little in it. The
original colony included N.S.W., Queensland,
Victoria, Tasmania, and a part of S.A. and the
Northern Territory. The first four of these,
at all events (N.S.W., Victoria, Tasmania,
and Queensland), being wholly within the
boundaries of that early convict-time depen-
dency, stand all on the same footing ; they
are all the “ mother-province,” and, bar-
ring the fact that Queensland, as containing
the biggest part of the real, original mother-
province, may be possibly entitled to put on
more frills than the others, there is verv little
to choose among them. In reality there is no
mother-province at all now, that historical she-
parent having gone into many pieces and
entirely lost her original shape and form and
existence, lasmania is the oldest self-govern-
ing province of the group ; Victoria the second
oldest—neither of which things count for any.
thing either, though they are as good argu-
ments as the “mother-province” idea. NS
Wales possesses the oldest city, which also
doesn’t count for anything. It is no more
essential tlgiot the Federal Government should
be in the oldest self-governing province or in
the oldest city, than that the Federal Govern-
ment should be run hy the oldest inhabitant
If the V mdther-proviiice ” has any special: claim
to the federal City then it may be pfajifhfl
either in N/S.W., Tasmania, Victoria, M
eastern part of 3. A.—or in Queensland, whert
that Piebald Land comes' in. They are all
equally the “ inotfier not that it matters a
straw whether they are or not. Therefore, if
N.S.W. is invited to waive any rights it pos-
sessed as being the “ mother-province,” it is
only making the same surrender as most of its
neighbors.
* * * «
It is also a plaint of the small crowd of pro-
vincialists that N. 3. Wales will have to surren-
der its Freetrade system for the sake of unity,
and one section of the Little Cornstalk Party
points to this as a great sacrifice, and one
which calls for special consideration. But,
in reality, N.S.W. has no Freetrade sys-
tem to surrender; only a revenue-tariff sys-
tem, which gathers in a very large customs
revenue per annum. And, in surrendering its
fiscal system, N.S.W. does no more than any
of the other provinces. If the five provinces
federate, all the five tariffs go into the melting-
pot together, and, as the province with the
largest Parliamentary membership, N.S.W.
will have a bigger say in the formation of the
new Federal tariff than any other member of
the Commonwealth. N.S. W, and Victoria may
both be said to have made a surrender when
they agreed that the less populous provinces
should have equal representation with them in
the Federal Senate, but they made so very
nearly the same sacrifice that one has just
about as much reason to demand special com-
pensation as the other. As regards money-
matters, the only semblance of an agreement, so
far, is that each province shall be credited
with its own contribution to the Federal
Treasury, and, after paying its own share
of the Federal expenses, shall receive
back the remainder, and on this basis
no province will sacrifice a halfpenny for
the benefit of its neighbor. This agreement, it
is proposed, shall last five years, and, at the
end of that time, the Federal Legislature—in
which N.S.W. will have a louder voice and a
greater voting power than any other province—
is to reconsider the situation. If any special
consideration is extended to Westralia in the
meantime, it will be at the expense of the other
four provinces equally.
* » » *
When the federation of the railway systems
was still one of the possibilities of the situation,
the voice of the Little Cornstalk Party was
raised very loud concerning the “ sacrifice ” by
N.S.W. that would be thus involved. Con-
sidering that, according to the Auditor-General,
the N.S.W. railway system has an accumu-
lated deficit of £7,735,000, and has an annual
shortage varying bet ween £200,000 and £400,000
per annum, and, further, considering that both
S.A. and Westralia now show better aggregate
results than N.S.W., the sacrifice is open to
considerable doubt. By all appearance, the
Little Cornstalk Party calls everything a brutal
robbery of N.S.W. on principle. But the
“sacrifice,” if there would have been one,
isn’t coming off, so this matter need not be
further considered. Again, when it wms
proposed that the Murray River system, which
spreads over Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria,
and S.A., should be made common property,
and be kept in a navigable state at the common
cost, so that western N.S.W. should have a
cheap outlet to the sea, and Tasmania and
Westralia would pay part of the cost of keep-
ing that outlet open, the voice of the Little
Cornstalk Party was raised in a deafening
clamor about another great sacrifice demanded
from the “ mother province.” This sacrifice was
quite as devoid of any visible evidence as the
others, but, as it also does not seem to be
coming off, it is another matter which may be
dropped out of the discussion. A proposal to
lump the public debts, so that Victoria, which
owes £4O per inhabitant, should go shares with
N.S.W., which owes about £5O, was barely
considered, but, when the matter did come up,
the cry of the purely provincial crowd in Sydney
about the sacrifice demanded from N.S.W. was
something terrible to listen to.
* * * *
Almost the only financial question which has
been decided so far is that the posts and tele-
graphs shall be combined, and that the large
postal deficit of N.S.W. and the smaller deficit
of Tasmania shall be thrown in along with the
profits of the other three provinces. This
isn’t a very great matter certainly, and
it will be a rather smaller one when a
uniform postal charge is established ; still, the
N.S.W. annual loss is so great, as compared
with the large profit shown by S.A., that there
is hardly any doubt the so-called “ mother-pro-
vince ” has, in this instance, got ahead of the
other partners to the proposed deal. And
these other partners haven’t, up to date, got
ahead of N.S.W. on a single visible point ex-
cept that of equal representation in the Senate,
in which matter N.S.W. and Victoria suffer
about equally. Therefore, when the Lyne and
Reid and Slattery push proposes thatN.S. W.,
instead of taking its chances with the other
provinces, should demand possession of the
Federal capital as a matter of right and
as compensation for the “sacrifices” it is
making in the cause of union, The Bulletin
reckons it a fair tiling to ask for further par-
ticulars. In short, it wants that brazen crowd
of political confidence men to explain where
these “ sacrifices ” are. This question is all the
more pertinent as the enraged Cabbage-tree
Mob threatens, in effect, to do its utmost to
keep N.S.W. out of the Federation and thus
burst up the Commonwealth, unless the just
claims of its province to be bribed or tipped or
greased in consideration of not bursting up the
Commonwealth are sufficiently recognised.
Federation has enough difficulties to content
against without having these difficulties in-
creased by the action of any gang of political
blackmailers.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Men Who Nearly Did Something.
Michael Flurscheim, the German-Jewish
social-reformer, proposes to settle in Maoriland,
and there advocate Land Nationalisation, and
possibly establish his Exchange Credit Bank.
Ben Tillett, the last social-reformer who came
this way, would also have settled in Maoriland
had the requisite funds been forthcoming. This
tendency on the part of social-reformers who
drift into this end of the South Pacific to make
a bee-line for what is almost, if not quite, the
most Democratic State on earth, where the row
is easiest to hoe, and where the social-reformer
is least needed, is rather disappointing. Ben
Tillett went to preach a Labor gospel—■which
was, after all,, only the crude, primitive gospel
of trades-unionism and strikes —to the Labor-
men who had captured the Government, and
were really running the machine of State on
their own—practically the same as sending a
mission to teach Krupp, of the great Krupp
gun, how to make and use the shark’s-tooth
club. Flurscheim goes to teach land-reform
in the country where they have the absentee
land-tax ; the graduated land-tax, which is fast
breaking up the big land monopolies; the
closer-settlement policy, by which the State
buys up big estates for subdivison on
sale or lease ; the State Land Bank ; the
State-managed Bank of N.Z. and the State Life
Insurance system. AH, these, agencies, no
doubt, are slower than, the ardent theoretical
reformer desires. But there is a limit to the
number of able politicians that any small com-
munity can find, and there are only so many
hours in the day, and so much money available
each year, and it is only possible to organise
and conduct successfully so many intricate new
financial operations in a given time while doing
the routine work of the, State as well, and
altogether the progress being made in Maori-
land is amazingly rapid. The chances are that ,
even Flurscheim can't accelerate it. Mean- ■
while, there are Tory provinces like Tasmania
and Westralia quite handy, where a reformer
is urgently wanted to break up the rocky soil
of monopoly and bigotry, yet no social reformer
settles there. The tendency is rather to go
where the heavy end of the log has already been
lifted and the biggest rocks removed off the
arable surface. The Bulletin, possibly because
it is growing older and more cynical, doesn’t
believe in the brilliant social reformer nearly
so much as it did. Henry George was
a great man, and he left a cult behind him
which is everywhere in a minority. It is a
very widespread minority which is eloquent
everywhere and yet grows strong enough no-
where to seize the reins of Government and
put its theories into practice as an object-lesson
to humanity. Richard SEddon is only a small
man in the world’s eyes, but, instead of preach-
ing a State Land Bank idea loosely all over the
earth, he grabbed hold of one small corner of
the globe with two big, gnarled hands and did
it. George Turner and Charles Kingston
did likewise ; they might have covered the
earth with eloquent literature advocating State
mortgages instead of private usury, but, in-
stead, they took hold in their own small way,
and set the thing actually going. Henry
George preached the taxation of land values to
60,000,000 people and things remain in the
United States practically as they were ; John
Ballance reached out for the reins of office in
a community that was small enough for him to
manage, and started the thing as an object les-
son to the world at large. They are both dead
now, but, on the whole, this paper would rather
have been Ballance than Henry George,
after all.
Cheap and Nasty Immigrants.
Dear Bulletin, —Strikes me that one of the
difficulties which our political connection with
Great Britain must bring about, will concern
our objection to alien races, as part of our
population. We may be able to. fix up John
Chinaman, and Dost Mahommed, and Ram
Jam Sammy. But what about Epaminondas
and Guiseppe? As an old shellback, I declare
that these gentlemen (the sort we get here)
are, taken in bulk, the dirtiest, falsest, most
immoral scoundrels on the face of the earth.
And they are coming in fast: All through Aus-
tralia and Maoriland you shall find these un-
savory persons loafing on the communities. They
live in companies, and force their presence upon
us very much as the Chinese do—passively, but
surely. They do not till the soil, nor build,
nor mine, nor engage in an avocation the pur-
suit of which benefits others as well as them-
selves. The Greek, it is true, generally
figures as an oyster-seller or fruit-vendor.
But, then, he returns very little to
the community. He employs only his
own countrymen, who work for a trifle and
live on a few beans and bananas. And so he
thrives, while the Australian or Britisher,
hard by, who consumes much meat and bread
and beer, and flings around in a decent and
philanthropic way, edges into the Insolvent
Court. Patriotism, somehow, has no show
against the base economy which prompts people
to buy from the Greek at a cheaper rate than
from the Australian. A halfpenny per dozen
for peaches turns the scale against the Australia-
for-Australians motto. As for the Italian, do
we not find him flourish as a bay-tree, with his
fiddle, or ice-cream cart, or lolly-shop ? And
he returns, as a consumer, as little as the Greek.
But, though we have at present no way of keep-
ing these people out, we might follow the ex-
ample of U.S. by reserving the oyster and
fruit trade to our own degenerates. We might
claim that these provinces have as yet no ear
for street-music, and so bar the entrance of
peripatetic fiddlers and twangers. And, in the
interests of public health, we might make it
penal for any Italian to vend icecream in the
streets, and sleep in the society of his freezer at
night. In a word, it could be done this way :
“What is your name?” “ Epaminondas Muiialospis,
your Excellency.” “ What country do you hail from?”
“Greece, great lord.” (Slaps his breast.) “Whattrade?”
‘Eh?” “ What tradlV hoW do you earn your living?”
• Ah—oh —yes. Excellency, I shall sell the fry fish.”
• No go, Epaminondas—qriifed'ftsli* is reserved to our own
people.” “ Ah, then, the o-raffiftf the nut—the ba-nana.”
“Sorry. It can’t be qone. J -You must go back, my
classic friend. Can’t land here. We want men—white
men—clean men.” “ Excellency, I am a man ; also white
—also clean. Pears’ so-op—yes, I know him.” “ By re-
pute, doubtless. He is well-advertised. But it can’t be
done. Next, please! Now, then, who are you?”
“ Andrea Orsini, Excellency. I am Italy.” “ You look
it. Well, what trade have youV “I makea vine to grow.
Also the wine, and the raisin, and the olive, Excellency.”
“All right. Brought a fiddle or organ along?” “Si,
signor; mucha musica.” “Confiscate to the State. If
you come here to grow the vine and olive, and make old
Panton sit up with joy, as a manufacturer of good wine,
all right, sonny. But no music, please. And you
haven’t brought a monkey, eh ?” “ Alas, signor, he died
in the Red Sea.” “Good. Well, now, deposit £5O with
the Department, as security of good behaviour; and
guarantee that you do not lapse into street art, or
beggary, or maccaroni, or ice-cream adventures, and you
can come in, Andrba.” “Signor! Fifity ponda ! Santa
Maria ! Ffifty ponda ! Signor ! If I have a fifity ponda !
I livia in Italy a polricca, for evera an’ evera, amena.”
“ You haven’t got it ? ” “ Alas ! Excellency, you laugha
at me.” “ Not I. You are not a humorous subject. Off
you go back to your ship. Try Japan, my son.” Thus
would it be quite possible, without disturbance of inter-
national relations, to keep out the offal that is being
thrust upon us by the worn-out and rotten States of
Europe.— Old Jack.
The Vision of P. Morgan.
An impression is beginning to arise in this
country that Pritchard Morgan, formerly of
Queensland and now a British M.P., has gone
off his head and is gibbering at the moon with a
very wild gibber indeed. The idea is based
principally on a letter addressed by the ex-
Queenslander to Joseph Chamberlain, the man
who is supposed to boss the colonial affairs of
the empire. Pritchard Morgan suggests that
Britain should confiscate all Queensland north
of a line drawn somewhere about Bowen, and
all Westralia north of Roebourne, and resume
possession of the greater part of the Northern
Territory, and create out of them a new
“ colony.” The self-governing powers of the
people are to be abolished, and the territory is
to be handed over to, and governed by, a
syndicate of British adventurers to be en-
gineered, apparently, by little Morgan. The
said syndicate, therefore, proposes to grab a
good part of the Charters Towers goldfield and
all the-Croydon, Hodgkinson and Palmer fields,
three or four railroads, a great stretch of
telegraph line, the towns of Cooktown,
Townsville, Palmerston, Normanton, &c.,
and fully one-fourth of Australia —about
the best - watered fourth. Nothing is
said about it taking over the local debt,
or paying for the assets, or asking
the consent of . the inhabitants. Pritchard
Morgan promises, as a special inducement,
that his syndicate will fill this new Northern
Australia with Chinamen and niggers, and thus
relieve the pressure of population in India
and Hongkong ; and he assures Chamberlain,
on his own unsupported weather-report, that
Queensland and the other provinces would be
quite willing and rather glad than otherwise to
hand over all this territory and all these big
towns, and the railways and public lands and
other things ; and that they wouldn’t object in
the least to the great nigger and Chow influx.
He also remarks that if Australia was thus
opened to the Chinaman, China would doubt-
less give valuable privileges to the Englishman
in return, and little Morgan points out
enthusiastically, almost in so many words, that
Australia would be so glad to see the English-
man get valuable privileges in China that it
wouldn’t in the least mind paying for them by
giving up a good deal of its own country in
exchange. All of which suggests that little
Morgan must be very mad indeed. If Britain
wants to get valuable privileges in China, why
not pay for them itself by offering Wales, which
is Morgan’s own country, as a field for Chinese
settlement? Nobody would miss Wales very
much.
. ♦
Mummer Morality.
Clement Scott, who writes inflated balderdash
for London D.T. in his character of “great ”
theatrical critic, has lately stepped from his
pedestal to pass a few' rational remarks con-
cerning the morality and otherwise of the play-
acting world. He couldn’t say anything that
was not already known to well-informed
outsiders, and he left unsaid a number of truths
which are patent to every thinking person.
Clement Scott, as a contributor of platitudes
to the eternal discussion on actors’ and actresses’
lives behind the scenes, is not of any more real
importance than Scott, the journalist; but he
happens to be a much-advertised person, there-
fore. Melbourne Herald sent a young man
round to Wilson Barrett with instructions to
get that great actor’s answer to some
statements by the great critic. An actor’s
answer to imputations against the honor of his
business is hot expected to be a solid argument.
Wilson Barrett didn’t disappoint expectation
in this respect. He said, among other things,
“ A good woman on the stage in a well-con-
ducted theatre is in no more danger than a good
woman anywhere else,” which is equivalent to
saying that a fierce competition for public
applause doesn’t tempt actresses to sacrifice
small moral scruples for the gratification of a
great personal vanity. Wilson Barrett would
have us believe that an actress is under as much
social suasion to “ keep straight ” as a “ gover-
ness, female doctor, artist or shop girl ”
that the law of Mrs. Grundy controls theatri-
cal life to the same degree that it rules the less
gaudy lives of women whose “respectability”
is absolutely essential to their bread-winning.
He would fain convince us that fear of the con-
sequences of a scandal is as strong in an actress
as in a governess, and yet Mr. Barrett must
have been personally acquainted with many
stage women whose scandalous notoriety is their
principal stock-in-trade. Has he never heard
of women selling their decency for a position on
the boards ? Has he ever heard of a girl going
wrong in order that she might achieve the
glory of teaching arithmetic to a parcel of brats ?
Mr. Barrett protests too much on behalf of
his professional sisters. Of the men, he says,
“The statistics of the criminal courts prove
that, as a body, actors are singularly free
from crime.” To this The Bulletin will
reply : The complaints of hotel and board-
ing-housekeepers prove that actors num-
ber more than their due proportion of
petty swindlers. Faults ami misfortunes
which bring other men to the felon’s dock are
inoperative, so to speak, on the mummer
character. A drunken working man may
brutally ill-treat, or murder, his unbeloved
wife because he is oppressed by a sense of
matrimonial bondage. An actor deserts the
woman he has wearied of. Not infrequently
they agree to desert one another. A commer-
cial man in money difficulties may embezzle
and suffer much from disgrace or legal conse-
quences. An impecunious actor, likewise an
actor who has not arrived at his last shilling,
will too frequently cadge, bilk, and borrow in
a small way, and be ten times as shamelessly
dishonest as the other fellow without getting
into trouble. The actor class, vain, hollow,
and false by profession, includes, to put
the matter mildly, quite as large a pro-
portion of unpunished rogues as any
other. They owe much of their dis-
honorableness to the special circumstances
of their meretricious lives, no doubt.
The world recognises this fact by not putting
much faith in actors. When a Poverty Pointer
“borrows” half-a-sovereign from us we don’t
dream of ever seeing it again. W hen the
gentlemanly young stage lover begs an intro-
duction to our tailor we expect the tailor to
get the worst of it. In fact, this hard
world has come to take the average actor’s
deficiency in moral principle for granted, and
when Wilson Barrett claims the virtue of
“ charity in an exceptional degree ” for the
most self-loving, envious, and tale-bearing
fraternity on earth —well, we should smile.
The Papuan Land Grab.
The news that a British syndicate, consisting
mainly of Lowles, M.P., and Wales’s well-
known hanger-on, Somers Vine, has obtained a
grant of 250,000 acres in New Guinea, is a
w'hole prize essay on Bull’s favorite mode of
boodle. New Guinea is, in an indefinite sort of
way, an Australian dependency—that is to say,
Australia pays almost all the cost of govern-
ment, whife the Governor, profane old Bill
M ‘Gregor, takes his instructions solely from
England. Whatever pioneering has been done
in New Guinea has been done almost wholly by
Australians. They would have done a great
deal more only that Governor M‘Gregor has
systematically discouraged prospectors, and
has mostly warned-off intending Australian
settlers. Britain has done nothing for the
island save supply a few itinerant sky-pilots to
lecl ure the little nigger. Somers Vine has
certainly done nothing for it at all. But Vine
is the friend of the corpulent heir-apparent,
and, apparently in consequence of that
fact, he came along with a note from
somebody which read, “ Give this man
250,000 acres.” When the concession of Vine
and Co. is pegged out, that enterprising firm
will, presumably, lie low, somewhat after the
manner of the famous Hampton Plains syndi-
cate in Westralia, and wait for results. The Aus-
tralian prospector will find gold for it in course
of time (if there is any gold there), not know-
ing that he is on Vine’s allotment. Australia
will pay some kind of a police force to keep the
nigger off Vine’s grass. It will open up the
country for population, which will make Vine’s
little plot of ground valuable. The Australian
will provide some kind of legal machinery, so
that the fat Vine can haul him up before it and
have him fined and cast in damages for inter-
fering with Vine’s privileges. And Somers
Vine will lie round comfortably in his pleasant
haunts in London, and pose as the enterpris-
ing hardy pioneer who helped materially
to—haw !—develope Papua. By-and-bye, if
the opening-up of Papua proceeds favorably,
and big mineral deposits ate discovered, -..rid
valuable lands are made accessible, other hardy
pioneers will proceed to develope the country
(in London) in the same fashion. If Britain
would send out 40,000 or any other number of
practical emigrants, and give them a square
mile of Papua apiece, probably no one would
object—-there is no earthly reason why anyone
except the Papuan nigger should object. But
the British city money-grubber is a curse to
every new country and every old one, and if
Britain is going to share Papua out among
Wales’s push the sooner this country stops
paying Governor M ‘Gregor’s salary and the
other expenses the better.
“ Robin Studholme ” writes from Maoriland :
“ Ignotus ” concludes that there is no such thing: as
unimproved value in land. When anyone wants land it
has a value, and directly Fatman sees that some poor
beggar desires it, he fences it in with capital, and
the more the poor beggar craves for it, the higher
grows the fence. In Maoriland rating on unim-
proved value is optional. When a certain number of
ratepayers propose the adoption of new rating, a poll has
to be taken. The little town where I have the honor
to be chairman of the Town Board Commissioners (a sort
of minor mayor—a civic foal) has lately adopted the sys-
tem. It is not an easy measure to carry, and the enemies
of it lie like L. Their chief contention during our litcle
election was that it would make the poor man poorer and
the rich man richer. The boss agitator against it started
writing in a metropolitan weekly as soon as the first
whisper of the movement got abroad. He signed himself
“ Watchman,” and when his identity became known, it was
understood that he intended to watch and prey. “ Watch-
man ” said in the paper that if a pore wharf-laborer
in the city of Wellington had a section of land and a cot-
tage in the same street as a certain knight had his man-
sion, and if both sections were of equal area, the hard-
working man would have to pay as much in rates as the
bloated aristocrat, and it was making the poor poorer.
Somebody replied that the wharf-laborer was a blessed
fool to stick his piggery in an aristocratic quarter, and
that he was not a poor man, as the capital value of such
a section would amount to a fortune for a poor laborer.
Then “ Watchman ” said, if a rich man bought 200 acres
in the country and a pore man an equal area, the former
would lavish' his wealth in clearing the land, fencing
and stocking it, and would send any amount of pro-
duce away to cut up the roads, whilst the struggling
settler opposite was rearing a family to enable
him to battle with the bush, get help to fence
the land, and earn money to stock it, and all the time he
would be paying rates to keep the roads for the rich man’s
carts and carriages to run on, and it was robbing the poor
to help the rich. Nevertheless, the proposal for rating
on unimproved values was carried by a good majority.
There was a lot of dirty work. Ananias could not have
done better had he been on the spot. Owners of vacant
sections were told they would be forced to build, and
their sole salvation would be to sell their sections to their
informant at his own price. But it did not eome off.
Cottagers were shown that they could own eight sections
and a cottage for the same rates as they were then pay-
ing for one section and a cottage. That fetched them.
Now that N.S.W. is considering a huge irri-
gation scheme in the western Riverina, and
Victoria is dreaming about another vast water
enterprise on the Wimmera plains, and con-
sidering also that even these are only a very
small beginning, The Bulletin desires to
repeat certain things which it has already said
quite a number of times. (1) When a reason-
ably complete system is established—one that
is large enough to irrigate all the irrigable
lands along the Murray river system—the
Murray, in ordinary seasons, will be abolished
as a river, and practically hone of it will
reach the sea at all. (2) Therefore, as it
will be necessary some day to divide its.
waters out fairly among the three provinces
interested (New South Wales, Victoria and
S.A.), unless they are ultimately to fight for
the precious fluid and spill each other’s blood
along the border-line, it is necessary to have
Federation, and to place the whole Murray ■
system under Federal control. (3) It is prac-
tically no use considering the Murray and its
affluents as permanent future means of naviga-
tion ; this horribly dry land can no more spare
fresh water to float vessels on than it can spare
beer for the same purpose. Australia must
depend on its railway system for internal
communication, which is just the reason
why its railways should be built in every
case to give the shortest and cheapest
outlet to the sea, irrespective of provin-
cial boundaries. And they can’t be so built
until Australia is federated and its railway
system is also put under Federal control.
These statements are getting pretty threadbare,
but as the local public has probably forgotten
all about them in its excitement about Giffen’s
refusal to hit a round thing hard with a bit of
wood they are here repeated on spec.

Wrixon wails that if appeal to the Privy
Council be abolished in Australian causes it—
Will necessarily produce diversity in dealing with the
principles of common law which are now one and un-
divided throughout the empire. Inevitably in due time
differences in viewing questions of contract, construction
of written instruments, such as bills of lading, charter-
parties, policies of insurance, etc., and matters of evi-
dence will spring up.
Wrixon says this argument has never been
answered, the assumption being that it is un-
answerable. But, in the first place, it is not
“ inevitable ” that such differences should arise ;
and, if they do, the Australian court would
differ from the English because it thought it
right, considering Australian circumstances, to
differ, in which case it would probably be
proper that there should be a difference. Any-
how, is there any more reason wh}' Australian
decisions should not differ from English de-
cisions than why Australian laws should not
differ (as they do, radically) from English laws’
Go to, Wrixon ! Thou art undone.
Gov. Brassey is not popular. The old man,
despite his English Liberalism, is too conserva-
tive to fit in with “colonial” ideas. He runs
bis domestic policy on the Hinglish country-
gentleman’s lines. The lord -of - che-manor
benevolence, such as Addison gave us in his
Sir Roger de Coverley pictures, reads well in
print, but it doesn’t appeal to a community
largely made up of young cocks in the full blast
of their first crow on their first dunghill. The
vice-regal-cum-paternal air with which the
good old Brassey contemplates “ his people,”
worries the self-pride of young Victoria just as
flies pester a short-tailed horse. Brassey has
a fondness for the benevolent-dictatorial style.
He has always a lecture on hand for the im-
provement of the popular mind —a discourse on
Federation, and the Church of England, and
Scripture-teaching in State schools —any sub-
ject about which he ought to keep his mouth
shut. But he means well, which is per-
haps where he fails. Well-meaning people are
generally unpleasant people. It is the cheery,
selfish, don’t-care-a-d n for anybody who is
usually the more popular in any society, from
Government House to Collingwood Flat.
Brassey is too earnest in a commonplace direc-
tion. He is made for the limited area of rustic
appreciation in dear old Hingland. Out here
we want something fresher, younger, more in
touch with the Devil and his ways.
“ When a man in the ‘ best ’ society committed
a dishonorable act—indeed, a crime—that
society banded itself together to screen him,
instead of hanging his body to a tree.” That
is what Lord Charles Beresford said, the
other day, at a dinner given by the New Vaga-
bond Club. Also he said : “ Any vulgarian, no
matter what his nationality, or the manner in
which he had made his money, could buy his
way into the society of the best and proudest
in the land.” That’s all right, and no news,
anyway. Trees are getting scarce in England ;
and, besides, a fellow-feeling makes us won-
drous kind. If all the men in the “best”
society who commit dishonorable actions were
hung up on trees, the parks of London would,
indeed, stink. And that is the reason why
“ society ” bands itself together to screen any
member that may be found out. As for the
money power of any vulgarian to purchase his
entry into the society of the best and proudest,
that is easily worked out. The best and
proudest (alleged) society at ’Ome is as shoddy
as any rag sent forth from a Manchester mill to
swindle the credulous. From Wales down —-
if there be a further depth—the best and
proudest (conventionally speaking) are the
worshippers of Money. Observe how readily
the Sassoons— Bombay traders in a poor
way before the cotton - famine days—
were taken in hand by Wales when
they came to England gorged with the
wealth they had made by accident. With
all the bad points of “society” half a
century back it was not then possible for any
greasy adventurer who might have collared
hold of a fortune to force himself within the
guarded gates of the “best” circles. It is all
rot, anyhow, because any sensible man knows
that the “ best society ” at any time, and in
any country, has always meant the worst, in a
moral sense. The best, in every worthy regard,
and especially as concerns decent conduct,
honorable traditions, a clean record, and intel-
lectual superiority, has never been the society
of a Court. As a general thing in Great Britain
the best society is “ county ” society. Even
in these days a man cannot buy his way into
that. A vulgar money-lender, or a lucky
diamond-merchant, or a rich pork-packer, un-
less he possesses merit other than his dollars,
will find it harder work to get into the houses
of some impoverished country squires than into
Sandringham or Windsor Castle. Tubby and
all his breed hold gold as the first of virtues.
All the same, good for “ Charley ” Beresford.

At Her Majesty’s (Sydney), on Saturday,
the new French Maid’’ started her sunshiny
existence where the previous Maid stopped four
months ago, and everything dropped into its old
place, just as if that little fluffy demoiselle had
never left off. The new season opened with a
large boom, and any other properties it could
abstract out of the hat-rack when the owner wasn’t
looking. When this paper went to press it still
boomed gaily. There is no solid food in this
frivolous little play ; it doesn’t represent the large,
gory beefsteak-and-damper of literature in any
sense—which is possibly the reason of its popii-
ianty. It is intangible, like the faint, far-off
recollection of the drink a fellow had,in a previous
state of existence. The heroine spends most of
tier life on one fantastic toe with the other one
pointed more or less at the stars, and sheds a
radiance around generally. The low-spirited
waiter is prepared' to smash all the kitchen
crockery in her service, and the sailor-man, and
her other adorers, including the huge, wooden
H rench policeman, are prepared to smash anythin**
and everything. But nothing really happens all
through, except innumerable song and dance, and
scenery and Chinese lantern. Two or three
people suffer from temporary execration on the
stomach through the idea that their wives or their
best girls are unfaithful, and a severe female who
would obviously defend her virtue with her green
umbrella to the last, is suspected of having been a
Woman who Did. All these suspicions evaporate
however and leave nothing behind them but
music and high-kick, and a glittering recollection of
much _b rench girl being hugged at the Casino,
also a vast amount of illumination and pictorial
gorgeousness.
* • • •«
Most of the old people fill their old
parts and the things, mainly favorable, which
Ihe Bulletin said about them four months ago
are still on deck. The old French Maid is gone
however, and Ada Reeve occupies the brief skirt
of Susette instead. She fills it quite as well as
her predecessor, too. The new Maidsings prettily
and acts what acting there is to do admirably, and
is a very beautiful atom weighing five-stone or
thereabouts. Regarded as a joyous speck of
frivolity who seems to make a humble but honest
livelihood and keep herself in frocks by being
honorably hugged at the Casino, it would probably
be difficult to improve on her. Bert Gilbert, in
the capacity of sailor Brown, is also a subject of
general approval, though the marine Brown is a
part, with only moderate possibilities. May Pol-
lards Dorothy is a nice girl with nothing very
particular to do. though she sings “I was Dream-
“S ? v ° lce which is reminiscent of Nellie
Stewart in the better days of that idol. As re-
ga^“tof; erow d : the evergreen Colem in,
and Phil Goatcher’s scenery, and the six girls who
do the tarantella-dance stand out conspicuously
ihe overwhdming success of the show, however,
is Albert Whelan (of Melbourne), who fills the
small, wrigglesome character of Alphonse, the
Gaul who rushes round with the hot plates and
the soup. Alphonse himself doesn’t amount to a
row of pms, but Whelan’s songs and imitations of
well-known actors brought down on him fifteen
encores in the first two nights. And no spidery
young man with a large comedy mouth could make
a much bigger hit than that.

Madame Albani, a songstress whose repu-

Sydney (February 23rd and 20th, and March 1)

In the absence of any positive news to the
contrary it is assumed that the stolen money
which Johnston Weir put in King Hedley’s
pocket at the Lyceum, will be found there every
't,, . r some little time longer. “ Man to
Man is a play which is good for a three weeks’
run under any ordinary circumstances. From a
strictly le.jal point of view it is a thing for the
smallest Jew solicitor s office-boy to mock at. The
average dramatist gets his hero into gaol logicallv
enough, as a rule, but, not having the faintest idea
how to get him out m a decently probable fashion
he causes him to he released in the last act on the
order of a benevolent friend acting on the unsup-
pqrted I reetrade statistics of the dying woman
with the mass of rat s-tail hair. Still, as almost
every dramatic hero gets out of gaol the same
way, there is nothing to be said against the pre-
sent drama more than against others. And the
railway accident is logical enough, anyhow, seeing
that it arises through a free and independent
British signalman trying to work 18 hours a day
f a vveek . so that he will have the other six
hours to spend thinking over the investment of his
savings.

A sudden and bitter disagreement which
took place last week between Phil Newbury and
the gods, and which culminated in Phil throwing
hisresignationat the great aggregate “ bloke ” in
the Tivolii gallery has apparently been healed.
Anyhow, the melodious Phil is still on the pro-
gramme and certainly the Tivoli without him
wouldn t be the same cheerful entertainment by a
long way. Iho Hegehnanus are still as described
last week-a strange and awful German mystery
that is past exp,anation, and an outrage on the
laws of gravity. Rickards has now got rid of his
magnificent white elephant, the Palace, which is
shut up and forgotten, so the Tiv. has again a
monopoly of the variety-show business, and pros-
pers in its old fashion.

The unhappy Sydney Opera House, where
fou climb over the ghosts of dozens of dead
managements to reach the stairway, opens again
on Saturday. The writer has tried to remember
how often this haunted barn has been opened in
the last seven years, and gives the problem up,
but its openings have been innumerable, and, in
spite of them all, it has been mostly shut,
its closings, too, have been many and pain-
ul, and at least a dozen different companies
have threatened to stoush the manager in its
mouldy side-entrance. The new firm, Messrs,
and Barnes, starts with “ Shamus
U linen, and announces “prices to suit the times
—dress-circle, eiyhteenpence.” Which should just
about suit the times—the lean and fleshless times
which were to be jolly and fat. During the Reid
regime three significant facts have arrived in Svd-
d’c K at; the Lyceum, the Is. Gd. dm.
' he Opera House, and the 3d. show at the
Royal Standard. And the penny drama is coming.

Silver King, at Melbourne Princess’s
proved its claim to be “ the most interesting pro-
duction of a memorable season,” by drawing a
bigger crowd than has attended any previous 're-
vival which the present writer can call to mind,
lherewas a well-acted and beautifully mounted
i \er King effort at the Royal, some time ago,
but although manager Westmacott worked on
popuiar prices he couldn’t persuade the multitude
that he was giving it a special treat. Walter
Bentley, under patronage of the local clergy, had
the lead m a more boomsome “Silver
King season at the Princess’s some time before
then. Bentley had the vote and interest of the
constituency which now plumps for Wilson Bar-
rett. Charles Warner and Alfred Bucklaw of
yore, were associated with only fairly successful
editions of this favorite show, and even Titheradge
the last time his Wilfred Denver was revived in
Melbourne (at the Princess’s) didn’t shake his
snowy locks before a crowded Saturday audience
ihe rush to see Wilson Barrett as the Silver
naturally sets one thinking of how circumstances
alter the financial cases of even the most unques-
tionable attractions. Middle-aged Australia
svyears by Tith.’s picture of the Silver King, and
'T'™ £° od reason - The BuLLEriN, way back in
the 80 s, comparing Tuheradge’s performance with
that of Wilson Barrett in London, and handsome
Osmond learle in New York, decided that the
first Australian Denver was the greatest of the
aforesaid trinity Yet it would probably be im-
possible to get Melbourne excited nowadays over
a • starring ”of Titheradge as Wilfred Denver.
* * * *
Theatre-goers who have grown critical
through experience always judge classic revivals
by comparison, therefore The Bulletin presumes
that the Wilson Barrett company’s rendering of
fcnlver King will be most admired by new-
comers to the play. The play is a fine melodrama,
capably acted and admirably staged, like all W
and, M. shows. Oidy the critics who have seen,
or think they have seen, better renderings of the
same play, will find fault with the entertainment,
in much the same way that they object to one
brand of whisky as being less soothing than another.
Wilson Barrett is served out to them as a
three-star brand, figuratively speaking, and
they take a carefui analysis of the article.
Ihe performance on Saturday revealed some
new departures in the stage-managing, and these
are not improvements as a rule, but they may
pass without protest. Bulletin readers are par-
ticularly interested in the question whether the
Denver family, Darnel J aikes, the Spider and his
wife, Elijah Loombe, Corkett, and the three his-
toric gossips at the village pub. are each, or any
of them, as convincing as the best of their prede-
cessors. ihe present writer says “No” for
general information, and for the sake of avvaken-
ing a responsive echo in the souls of all experi-
revivai reaC * erB wb ° may bave sam P le d the present

Horace Hodges, as Jaikes, holds his own
against memories of Phil Day and Royce in one
or two places—notably the recognition of Denver
outside the cottage, where he is stronger than
Elton ever was-but the new Jaikes Ts rather
wanting in humor where humor is expected. The
other chief people, without exception, are less
forcible, or less humanly natural, than the Aus-
Kw^r I *, ‘ Jlay r b ? n at tile Royal in Westmacott’s

to the end of Wilson Barrett's season. His name
has a share in the celebrity of the play.
“The Shaughraun,” best of Irish dramas

old friend Grattan Riggs was the blioy in the red
coat once more. Many Conns, of uncertain age

tion the fact Outside of Grattan Riggs, the
oompany at Melb. Royal, taken altogether is
several degrees higher than the average “Shaugh-
raun company of recent times, and Boucieault’s
work gets a fair chance to remind one of its intrin-
sic worth. J. p. O’Neill and G. Chalmers make
amends for the inflexible young man in charge of
the Balleyragget army. Miss Duggan and Miss
-Ida Gresham are putting on charm and polish
pretty rapidly, and Miss Alice Deorwyn
is a less pronounced actress—consequently a more
acceptable Moya—than she was a while ago.
Manager Holloway, as the praste, breathes piety
with an oppressive emphasis which betrays his
long stage experience in villainy of the deepest
aye, but he has done his best in stage manage-
ment and sceuery, and “The Shraughraun ” on

Also, “ Jack the Giant-killer” promises to
run till further orders at the Opera House. No
pantomime is a fit subject for serious reflection,
ana Kicicards pantomime seems to be peculiarly
lull ol gorgeous vanities and irrelevant pomp and
circumstance. There must have been a book at
the foundation of this expensive affair, but the
poor little bit of literature was probably
danced out of knowledge by many push-
ing feet. Anyhow, very little trace of
it is left to tell the tale, and when
a vision of Britannia, surrounded by her hired
defenders, crops up at the tail-end of the enter-
prise, nobody would feel astonished if the Tiller
Quartette damsels were to come along and tilt her
helmet with a fascinating back-kick. Melbourne
loves the Tiller Quartette. The city likewise
adores a number of other incidental angels, some
of vyhorn wear wondrous tights, and the frequent
tailing down of several popular comedians is
favorably received.

Dan Barry, at the Alexandra, continues to
execute a new order for topical drama every week.
Bast Saturday s horror was “ Black Thursday, or
lhe Jury of the Blames,” and a large, heated
audience cheered violently, on the understanding
that the author had derived his five acts from the
latest Gippsland bushfires. Gippsland, at the
Haleck, turned out to be a level tract of coun-
try suffering from parallel lines of blazing
cardboard bush. The Mayor of Melbourne;
or somebody came to the relief of the district on
a smaU matchwood engine, and having stopped his
bicycle he rushed into a shanty ana brought forth
the unconscious figure of a Toorak heiress who
had been put there to burn. Among 30 characters
K ns ° n th , 6 , Black Thursday ” bill was one
*ied. Chyrnside (a wealthy and foolish young
Victorian), also Mrs. Chyrnside (a philanthropist).
Ihis looks as though a well-known Victorian
family is expected to take the hint.

The re-opening of Melbourne Bijou, with
a first-class company in a first-class play will
happen on Saturday (19th) as The Bulletin men-
tionod last week. It is an interesting experiment,

by the 1 ederal Con ventioners, has been premised

Many conflicting and unfair statements have been made
anent a popular Australian baritone who lately returned
from London after, it is alleged, receiving just one lesson
from the great Santley. But Santley-himself wroth
over the loss of his pupil—admits that the Australian
naa many lessons from him, after which there
was no more money to pay fees. The mere fact that the
baritone in question came back to Australia under en-
gagement with a high-class concert co., run by people
who know,” proves that he was not considered such a
stick.
“Talking of elocutionary arts,” remarks a Bulletin
correspondent, “ do you admire the preliminary hissing
by Wilson Barrett before enunciating the letter
b t Really, if your attention wanders from the stage
for a moment, and in the meantime some catastrophe
overtakes the heroine, you get quite a start when W.B.

An Albani yarn. In her earliest London days, when the
rivalry with Patti was at its height, two medical students
were looking at photos, of both songstresses in a big
Kegent-street shop. Said one : “There’s the new soprano',
Aibam ; she’s singing Patti out of town.” A lady in the
crowd at the window turned slowly round, faced the
speaker, remarked “ Thank you, sir,’’'bowed, and walked
off. It was Patti. The rivalry died out long ago. There
was room for both ; and each treasures photos, of the
Other (presented by the other) now.
The statement that George Rignold intended to devote
himself solely to management in future was premature,
and rested on no good foundation. Anyhow, he savs
that he hasn’t retired from the footlights, and he ought
to know something about the matter.

Demise, comedian Blakeley, the most unctuous old-man
actor since “Primrose” Hill, the original Cattermole.

to Wyndham, and doing all the wicked old men of his

healthy mind. How different to the hearty old man of
the old comedy !

The Melbourne proceedingsagainstOrange-
nien, during which it came out that members of
the police force belong to the L.0.L., emphasise
Ihe Bulletin s recent remarks against State
servants belonging to secret societies. It is cus-
tonaary to ask Vic. police recruits, on being sworn,
if they belong to secret societies. The usual
answer is no ! Anvhow, it doesn’t signify', be-
cause, if “yes!” nothing is done, and, often,
recruits don t join the societies till after they are
sworn. It is a fact that Chief Commissioner
Ohomley, in order to prevent the police from
marching in the Brunswick Orange procession, is-
sued the ingenious instruction that no member of
the force was to appear in public, on that day un-
less in uniform. The police-court proceedings to
test the Green v. Orange squabble were disgraced
by flagrant Jaypeeism. The bench was adiriit-
tedly,packed yvith Orangemen, and “the other
side thereupon sent a special J.P. along to
ensure committal. With a bench so constituted,
the proceedings were an obvious farce ; but, as the
main object is to get a cold, legal opinion on the
issue, these preliminaries don’t matter. The diffi-
culty now will be to get an impartial jury.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Last year the Australian Widows’ Fund tackled
in a manful spirit its share of the legacy of trouble left by
the boom, and wrote £124,977 off its assets —nearly 10 per
cent, of the whole accumulation. This vigorous policy
has evidently brought its values down about bed-rock, for
sundry properties sold during the year realised £2259
more than the values now set against them. This sum,
with any future receipts from the same source, is wisely
set aside as a reserve against any possible further depre-
ciation to come. As far as the general business is con-
cerned the Widows’ Fund is still suffering from bad times,
too much competition, too heavy expenses caused by over
competition, excessive surrenders, and similar troubles.
The last few years show 7 as follows :
Renewal Premiums. New Premiums.
1892 .. £153,525 £15,474
1893 .. 152,816 10,559
1894 .. 145,361 10,094
1895 .. 139,208 12,060
1896 .. 137,517 13,236
. 1897 .. 136,603 12,056
This means that the total premium income has fallen in
iix years from £168,999 to £148,659.
For 1897 the amount added to the funds is
only £49,005. In 1896 the funds increased by £68,392.
In 1893 over £lOO,OOO was added to the accumulation.
The loss by surrenders in 1897 was £35,600, equal to nearly
a quarter of the premium income. Also, the expense-rate
continues very high, being nearly 25£ per cent, on pre-
miums. In 1893 the expenses gotdown to the comparatively
moderate figure of 22 per cent. They rose to nearly 27
per cent, in ’95. In 1896 they got down again just below
25 per cent., and now there is another serious rise
The good features of the Widows’ Fund are
that the interest receipts (£58,446) keep up very well,
though even after all the writing off they only equal £4 16/6
per cent, on the average funds. The amount of interest in
arrear (£2934) is small, and looks well for the soundness
of the securities. The “ freehold properties acquired by
foreclosure ” only amount now to £49,466, which is a
Very moderate burden. The Widows’ Fund, how-
ever, still estimates future interest receipts at 4 per
cent., whereas the best offices are now cutting down their
estimates to 31 per cent, for greater security. Altogether
the W.F. looks a mediocre concern with no very dazzling
prospects. The large writing-down of values (a proceed-
ing which some other institutions in the same business
unfortunately lack the courage to imitate) places it in a
sound position, but the steady falling-off in business
keeps the expense rate high and the ex.’s swallow up
altogether too much of the profits.
* * * *
Messrs. Fraser and Dick, the retiring directors
of the Australian Widows’ Fund, were re-elected without
a struggle, after all. Joske, the protegee of Attorney-
Gen. Isaacs, found that it was useless for two Hebrews to
try conclusions with a couple of Scotchmen in bidding for
what is largely a Scottish vote.

Things look better this half-year with the
Southern (Marine) Insurance Co. (Melbourne), the profit
being £2774. A 5 per cent, dividend (£1250) is paid, and
the other £1524, added to previous balance, leaves £13,757
at credit of profit and loss. Last half-year showed a dead
loss of £10,762, so there is a very large improvement. The
pity is that the Souihern didn’t cut down its dividend to
the present moderate figure long ago, instead of eating
large holes in the concern by paying big dividends which
w 7 ere not earned. The following statement shows the
wild career of the Southern of late years !
Dividend Paid.
June, ’92 Loss £1914 15 per cent. = £3750
December, ’92 Profit 291 „ 3750
June, ’93 „ 5546 „ 3750
December, ’93 „ 9639 „ 3750
June, ’94 „ 3931 „ 3750
December, ’94 ~ 5364 ~ 3750
June, ’95 Loss 1393 10 per cent. = 2500
December, ’95 Profit 1689 „ 2500
June, ’96 „ 3431 „ 2500
December, ’96 Loss 1521 „ 2500
June, ’97 „ 10762 nil
December, ’97 Profit 2774 5 per cent. = 1250
Net Profit £17,105 Dividends £33,750
The directors of the Southern Co. are invited to
seriously consider these figures. They paid eleven
dividends in the last twelve half-years, three of them
being paid against an actual loss, and two more being
greatly in excess of profits. In the six years they paid
away £16,645 more than they received—in other words,
they paid aw ay nearly twice the net earnings. They kept
up an average of 11 j per cent. Even allowing for the
fact that the tremendous loss at June, ’97, was probably a
thing that no management could foresee, and leaving it
out of the calculation, still, in five normal years—June,
1892, to December, 1896—the Southern management
earned £25,093 and paid away £32,500 (or £7407 more
than its earnings) in the insane struggle to keep up an
average dividend of 13 per cent, per annum. And it did
this at a time when it was compelled to take £5OOO from
its reserve fund, which never got to be over £50,000 even
in its best days, as a provision for possihle losses which
should have been charged against revenue. Whether the
£5OOO is sufficient to cover depreciation it is difficult to
say. Anyhow, the Southern is now a good deal smaller
concern than it was six years ago ; it is also a good deal
smaller than it was ten years ago ; and unless the board
sticks closely to its new and eminently wise policy of
economy it has every chance to grow smaller still.
* * * *
Sydney and Suburban Hydraulic Power Co.
earned a profit of £10,016 for last year. The profit for
1896 was £7209 ; for 1895, £6536 ; and for 1894, £4740 ; so
this concern is steadily improving its position. A 10 per
cent, dividend swallows up £7500; £750 goes to reserve
for renewal of plant (making it £2550); £1250 goes
towards depreciation, and the balance makes £2302 at
credit of profit and loss. The co. has now written off all
its preliminary expenses, and it should next seriously
consider the advisability of gradually writing off that
other paper asset, goodwill (otherwise “ Parliamentary
rightsyand concessions ”), £15,000. Goodwill, in any shape
or form, is a very shadowy asset, and though it came in
handy to square the accounts in the early, unprosperous
days, it shouldn’t remain there permanently.
* * * *
Broken Hill Water Supply co. shows a profit
for the half-year ended 31st December, 1897, of £15,705,
as compared with £13,365 (or £8879, after allowing for
depreciation) at June, ’97; £10,077 at December, ’95;
£6686 at June, ’96 ; and £12,901 at December, ’95. There
is thus a very steady and solid improvement in the last
two years. A dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per
annum absorbs £9325, and the other £6380, added to pre-
vious balance, leaves £18,567 at credit of profit and loss.
There are sundry contras, however, to be set against this
favorable result. The new half-year has to face an outlay
of £2OOO fora new main, in place of one which recently
gave way ; also, 16000 for a new filtration scheme. One
of the co.’s assets is “ Water rights, leases, Parliamentary
Bills, &c., at cost, *25,193;” this is really in the nature
of goodwill, and will have no definite value when the co.’s
rights expire. Therefore it ought to be extinguished by
a sinking-fund, yet no such fund appears. Also, no de-
preciation seems ever to be written off the £150,u00 or so,
original cost of construction, and there is a reserve of
only £2500 for cont ngencies. Further, this half-year
there is no sign of any allowance for depreciation of plant,
tools and fittings. Even with all drawbacks, however,
the position looks pretty good. Some day, probably, the
silver deposits will end, and then Broken Hill will shift
bodily, and leave the Water Supply co. to earn a pre-
carious living at irrigation; but that disaster is a long
way off yet.

Balmain New Ferry Co. (Sydney) reckons its
last half-year’s profit on paper at £1306, a very solid im-
provement on some previous returns. Unfortunately, the
co.’s fleet blazed up beautifully one morning not long
since ; and the loss (amount not yet ascertained) is very
inadequately covered by insurance ; also the co., even
after stopping payment of the usual dividend, has only
£3200 of reserves with which to meet the shock (the
natural result of much 10 per cent. div. in the past), and
the present position is undefined. Meanwhile it has bor-
rowed the sere and greeny tub—the affair which gets
badly licked when it and the wharf have a race now and
then—from its hated rival, the old Balmain Ferry Co. (in
liquidation), and its own gathering of singed ruins is
under repair.

N.S.W. Land-Tax Department insists that the
Equitable Insurance Co.’s allotment, George-street, Syd-
ney, near the Post Office, is worth now about £BOO a foot
frontage. Yet last week the Government offered forsale the
old No. 2 police-station site, 122 ft. frontage to the busiest
part of George-street with 140 ft. frontage to Pitt-street,
close to the railway-station ; and, after much advertising,
the best offer was £127 per foot.

The New York Life Insurance Co. proposes
hereafter to base its calculations on the assumption that
its funds will only 3'ield 3 per cent, in the future. No in-
crease of premium is involved by this precaution. The
other two American offices doing business in Australia
base their estimates now on 3) per cent. So do the
A.M.P. Society, Mutual Life Association, andM.L. Govern-
ment Department. The bulk of the offices here, how-
ever, still stick to the old 4 per cent, estimate, which
looks as if it might become just a trifle dangerous in the
not-very-distant future.

In Sydney, the other day, one Funston, man-
ager of the “ Scottish Trade Advocate and Fidelity
Society,” was charged with giving an unstamped receipt.
He pleaded that he wasn’t personally responsible, being
only the paid manager of the society. Further inquiry
elicited that the “society” consisted solely of the man-
ager’s wife. A good many people who put their un-
reasoning faith in trade protection societies would do well
to inquire if their particular society also consists of one
lady and a man who gives unstamped receipts.

Coming close upon the Melb. warehouses fire,
the enormous country losses by bush fires in Vic.
bid fair to either wipe out, or cripple for many years,
quite a number of the Australian fire-offices. Those
co’s which combine marine with fire biz. are still worse
off, as two very heavy Australian marine losses during the
last 12 months are both almost entirely covered by local
institutions.

The interesting question is to be shortly settled
in Melb. whether a solicitor, engaged in the defence of a
forger, can be held as an accomplice of the forger, where
he (the solicitor) has, as is alleged, received for his
services the whole or part of the "proceeds of his client’s
forgery.

Much rejoicing amongst the Melb. community
of swindling grass widows who have husbands “some-
where,” at a recent decision which prohibits married
women being charged on fraud-summons. The only
means shopkeepers now have of protecting themselves is
to insist on the wife leaving her husband in pawn to the
shopkeeper until the goods bought are paid for.

Says Mr. Ludowici, the well-known Sydney
leather-merchant :—“ The English War Office, in declining
to buy Australian leather, gives a big Protectionist sop to
the Freetrade English tanner. The War Office’s stated
reason is that it will have only English leather because it
is the best. But what else could the War Office say when
it desired to make its leather-trade a monopoly for the
English tanner ? The stated reason is too false and too
obvious an excuse. In India the locally-tanned leather
has proved remarkably superior to the English ; while the
tests of tensile strengths made by Prof. Warren, of Sydney
University, a few months back, show that Australian is
better than English leather by 12| per cent. The inferi-
ority of English leather is becoming a public fact, and
much backstairs influence at the War Office, and every-
where else, is needed to prop up the falling industry. It
is not because English leather is the best that the War
Office has decided in favor of it, but because English hide
is the thickest, and is on the spot to engineer its schemes.
Australia, for the greater part, has perfect climatic condi-
tions for tanning ; there is not the need here to treat the
liquors in winter, as is necessary in England, in order to
keep the tanning process going.”

The plant for the Kohler zinc process is to be

The process is well introduced, anyway. Carmichael, who

The dry-crushing and cyanide plant of the Over-
flow mine in far western N.S.W. is to start this week.
Sampling shows about £oz. per ton, and if the return is
equally good The Bulletin congratulates the squatters on
having a mine. Many calls have been made, and up to date
only one small lot of shares forfeited. Probably this can be
said of no other mine in N.S.W., where most mines are
regarded by shareholders as swindles after the third or
fourth call.

HJohn Howell, in his report on the mines largely
owned by the Smelting co. of Australia: “ The White
Rock is steadily improving, and I should be much sur-
prised if it has not a bright future before it. With careful
management, it promises much.” By the Great White
Polar Bear—when ? Over £lOO,OOO has actually been spent
on this mine, which has been promising big things for ten
years.

The Emma Co., London, has passed through
much tribulation and reconstruction. Was founded by
Baron Grant in ’7l, with a million capital, to take over
silver-mines in Amerioa, for which it paid half-a-million
cash. They went to the bad. Two years ago it promoted
the Hannan’s. Golden Pebbles, and some £20,000 has since
been swallowed up and the co. has gone into liquidation.
The Emilia still goes on her way. She is about to turn
attention to the opening up of the Post-office mine,
N.S.W. The writer only happens to know one mine ot
that name in N.S.W., and, if it is the same, his advice
would be “ Whoa ! Emma.”

A new manager from Ballarat has taken control
of the Eleanora mine, Hillgrove, N.S.W. Some of the
directors, too, have made way for others, All that is
wanted now is a new an 4 richer lode. This mine was
bought some seven years ago for £35,000 cash, and has
since paid away in wages some £35,000 a year. That,
with the exception of one or two small divs. and the £2OOO
now at credit, represents the whole of the gold and anti-
mony produced.
» * * *
The Mt. David (N.S.W.) G.M. Co.’s balance-
sheet is a woeful document. The co. appears to be over
£BOOO in debt, against which the directors have the as-
surance of the new boss that, during the process of
development, the mine will be self-supporting. The
former manager says that, ten tons from the opening of
one drive going ljoz. per ton, he was led to expect pay-
able results all through, “ but the crushing proved that
the stuff, taken all through as we did, would yield only
about 3dwt. per ton. ... I find that the gold is confined
to veins going all through the main body of the lode.”
Exactly what was said of this show more than a year ago
and denied by persons who were certainly in a position to
know the truth. Hutchens, who has lately taken charge,
declares that the battery has been put in the wrong place,
and the main shaft “ is completely out of place.” . . . “ If
your present ‘ ratting’ system is persisted in, you will be
closed down, nolens volens, in a very short time, and 10-
head of stampers will be all you require to do it.” The
directors have very little to say, and some of that is mis-
leading. “ It is satisfactory to know that the sample of
the last blanketings marked No. 2 B.A. contained over 9oz.
of gold to the ton, and that this gold was in the pyrites
(magnetic iron), and not in the form of amalgam.” No
allusion to the other assays of blanketings—one of which
is under an ounce—is made, nor to the manager’s remark :
“ The amount of blanketings for fortnight approximates J
ton.”

Hannan’s Oroya balance-sheet to hand, and, for
practically a non-producing mine, the expenses in London
are appalling. Over £37,000 has gone on account of the
mine, nearly £3OOO in London, £720 in Adelaide, and in
this case, too, there is “ Mr. W. G. Brookman, special fees
and travelling expenses, subject to adjustment, £750.”
Sundry debtors, £1515 ; cash in hand, £3OO. The
manager says “ there are great possibilities of your mine
becoming a'first-class gold-producer.” It will need to be
—it is already a first-class gold-consumer. Another re-
construction looms.

Lady Maude G.M. co. A shareholder who

alone sends along her report and balance-sheet. Two
little crushings for the year aggregated 39 tons'for 28oz.
gold. Most of the gold is in the tailings, and hope is ex-
pressed that some day cyanide will take it out. The boss
advises “ judicious expenditure and a little more working
capital”—and there is £35 in the bank. There is one
thing striking about Lady Maude—the boss * is named
Baker, the legal manager Miller, one of the directors
Pollard. Alas 1 the solicitor’s name is Croaker 1 ____

Brookman Brothers’ Boulder, W.A., meeting,
London. Decided to increase capital to £175,000 by the
creation of 55,000 new shares of £1 each; £35,000 to be
held in reserve, the other 20,000 to go to shareholders at
255., or one for every six now held. An amendment that
all future issues should be made to the shareholders pro
rata was lost. Why, in common fairness, should such a
rational proposal be negatived? The meeting, too, was
assured that the whole issue had been guaranteed. Why
go to that trouble, seeing that the market for the shares
was 50s. and they are issued at 255. ? It will probably be
found that the guarantors have a call on some of the
reserved shares. This is the sort of thing that takes place
in nearly every English reconstruction. The Associated
Mines’ new issue was guaranteed at 505., though the shares
were worth 90s. It would be interesting to know if Bull
gives guarantees for nothing, and, if not, how much this
guarantee—so-called—cost the company ?

Warm meeting of shareholders of White Feather
Main Reef mine, W.A., lately held in London, at which
certain directors were described as a set of plunderers,
and the person who applied the epithet declined to spell
it with a “ b ” to make it a little more courteous. Raised
in gold from the mine, £5757 ; sunk in London in direc-
tors’ fees, &c., £5200. Spent in mine development,
£18,528. The directors’ financial ability is shown in their
borrowing £4OOO at a cost of £BBO, or 22 per cent. The
co. has been through one reconstruction, and it is now
proposed to go through another which may cost £14,000.
Many victims in Adelaide, where the local directors re-
signed in disgust. One shareholder remarked : “ This has
been an exceedingly damaging business between Australia
and England; it destroys confidence.” Refreshing to
hear something said in London re the confidence of Aus-
tralia. How can Bull expect to get any more mines if he
destroys Australia’s confidence ?

The violent efforts made from Kalgoorlie to
boom the Bank of .England mine in Adelaide create more
fun than effect. The Adelaide dailies that never tire of
publishing wearisome reports from W.A, mines sometimes
have two and three a week from this show. The authori-
ties are great on possibilities and potentialities—their
latest is that if this and that happens then the value of
the mine will be increased at least £50,000. The market
has decided to wait and see.

Much was said by newspapers of the crushings
as they occurred from the W.A. Proprietary cement
leases. Never a word as to the limited nature of the sup-
ply. That was the shareholders’ funeral. Their lamenta-
tion comes from London. Total amount of gold recovered,
74000 z., to win which cost the co. £30,084. This was
attributed to high wages, enormous quantity of work
before the value was proved, and the amount of labor,
whether useful or not, to comply with labor conditions.
One subsidiary co. had turned out an awful disappoint-
ment as far as cement was concerned, but the manager
had explored and found a reef and was hopeful. The
parent co. was in a bad way. The cement was worked
clean out, and careful examination gave no hope of find-
ing anything payable in the way of reefs.

The recent Westralian Mines-office ukase that
the dry-blower shall not mine for alluvial at a greater
depth than 10ft. demonstrates that, in the opinion of
Forrest and co., the country must, at all costs, be run for
the exclusive benefit of the heterogeneous riff-raff of
mine-spielers and bummers who control the Westralian
market in London. The milk in this particular cocoa-nut
is said to be that Zeb Lane and Haw-haw Waddington
were negotiating for the Ivanhoe Venture mine, of which
Moran, M.L.A. for E. Coolgardie, is chief Panjandrum.
Lane was satisfied with the mine, but objected to buy a
law-suit—the dry-blowers, having found surface gold on
it, were agitating for the right to enter upon and win the
alluvial. “Would the Mines-offiee assist in the matter!
Would it guarantee a title?” After some parley, th 6
Mines-ofiice was willing to practically override any pend-
ing or future judicial decisions in relation thereto. Any-
how, the now famous proscription of the rights of the
alluvial miners has sounded the death-knell of the Forrest
crowd as at present constituted.

The “ Victorian Gold Estates C 0.,” a strong
Bull venture, to open up deep alluvial at Moolore, Vic.,

the shareholders that boring had proved the lead to be

Haack’s alluvial claim at Kanowna is in thp
centre of the cemetery. Driving from the 45ft. level one
of the workmen “drove his pick right into the centre ot
a playing-card —‘ three of hearts.’ It was glued to a piece
of mullock, but, with the exception of being slightly

Hampton Plains Estate: This co. has reached a
ricketty stage at which its shareholders can chew cold
iron in reflecting on what may happen to men when they
attempt to hog a principality for all that is above and
below the earth. It was on this Westralian estate that a
pup co. modestly proposed that prospectors should work
on thirds—one clear third for the pup, one for the parent,
and one third for the prospectors, who had to find every-
thing out of it. “Unfortunately,” says the chairman,
“ the subsidiary companies have not achieved the success
anticipated.” How extraordinary ! The Coolgardie
Water Works Co., in which it was largely interested, had
been so far disappointing, attributed to the shutting-down
of so many mines. The live sto k which the co. had pur-
chased had not proved profitable. Altogether £350,000
had been set aside for depreciation. To the development
of the mineral resources of the estate the directors had
given chief attention, and it was decided to throw it open
for a licensing-fee of ss. and £1 an acre rent —the finder of
any reef having the right to take 24 acres, while the co.
keeps a reserve around any area so pegged. Though last
year’s results had been grimly disappointing, shareholders
were asked not to take too gloomy a view.

On behalf of the “unfortunate outsiders’’ a
Crown Lyell shareholder wants to know what they may
hope to gain by reducing their interest in the mine from
a one-125,000th to a one-300,000th per share ? Well, they
gain salvation from the risk of paying calls, and in the
event of the mine not proving to be all that fancy paints
it, what more could the shareholders expect to gain ? The
complainants in this case are, as usual, the simpletons
who paid up to 28s. for their shares on spec., without
understanding aught about the nature of their spec.

A Canadian official report shows that gold has
been worked in Klondyke region since ’72 ; also, that a
Scotchman named Marks, who has been there for 12
years, has been able over the whole period to make but a
bare living ! Great Scott, what a place to go to! When
a Scotchman named Marks can’t do any good, what sort
of a show has John Smith?

Victorian Mt. Morgan—The mine is about to
assert itself, the 10-head battery, pelton-wheel and water-
race are ready, and the boss “ has great hopes of the
crushings turning out according to expectations. The
chairman submitted a sample of ore which had just been
received from the Great Boulder, W.A., which is exactly
the same character of ore as samples submitted of the
ores now being crushed by the Mt. M.G.M. co.” But why
leave its great namesake alone ? This comparison busi-
ness is a bad sign, and indicates mining babyism.

Mount Deddick strings continue to be pulled
violently at intervals, and the bold advertisement ob-
tained for this far-away show seems to have brought
forth a few genuine buyers at wildly fluctuating prices.
Begelhole, who one time painted a golden future for the
Gen. Gordon (W.A.) district, is now assisting to shed a
silvery light on the Deddick question. If the Vic.
Minister of Mines wants any stronger assurance than
Begelhole’s that a Deddick railway ought to be con-
structed he had better journey to the Mount and in-
spect its richness for himself, and come back with a ser-
mon on the Mount for the guidance of mining investors at
large.

The astounding Horace Tozer, Q. Home
Secretary, speaking at Gympie :
Since office was conferred on me in 1890, my two watch-
words have been, as they were my harbor lights through
life, “Honor and Truth.” (Laughter.)
Gympie is the headquarters of Tozer’s electorate,
where his glorious political unveracity is known
even to the school-children—so no wonder they
laughed. Then Tozer indignantly proceeded :
Yes, I say truth, and there is to that hospital of yours
the sum of £lOO to any man who can come on to this
platform, now or at any time, and show that I ever broke
a promise, failed to pay an obligation, or said a word in
public or otherwise that was not in accordance with
truth.
This from the politician whose name has been so
often associated with large, airy—well, say, exag-
gerations—that the Q. vernacular has a new
phrase—“ That’s a tozer ! ”
The English amateur cricketers say
that the reason they didn’t shake a leg at the
Glen Innes ball which they attended was that they
were never properly introduced to any of the
ladies. The ball-officials, on the other hand, aver
that they were all ready to introduce the visitors,
who, however, showed no inclination to take active
part in the proceedings. Strange that this sort of
misunderstanding should so frequently occur at
dances given mainly in honor of the visitors !
Thb Bulletin suggests that in future, to prevent
misunderstanding, Ranji and co. (if they really
want to dance, and have no flies on their noses to
put ’em out of step) should be addressed in the
vernacular by the M.C. : “ Now, gents, collar yer
mutton —’ere’s yer little bit of skirt! ”

Apropos the abuse of hospitals by the
opulent: The other day a very plainly-dressed
man took a richly-ar rayed child of about five
years to Sydney Hospital for free out-door treat-
ment. His brutal manner to it caused the pre-
scribing doctor to ask him what relation he bore
to the child. “None,” he replied, “it ain’t my
kid—it’s the boss’s.” “ And who are you ? ” asked
the medico. “Oh, I’m the bloomin’ servant,
graftin’me soul out for twelve bob a week, and
got ter cart the kids ter the hospital whenever
they’re sick.” “Hoes your employer keep any
other servants?” “Oh, yes! two more besides
me ! ” The doctor very rightly refused to treat
the child. What a fund of humor must be
possessed by the man who sends his children in
charge of a servant to be treated as paupers !
In one city hospital, where out-patients are
attended to in the order in which they take their
seats, a hospital employe is told off to see that
this is done, and to prevent crushing and squab-
bling. One day two “ sports,” anxious to get
away to a ponv-meeting, had the nerve to call
this official aside and offer him 2s. 6d., and then
ss. each, to smuggle them into the doctor’s room
first.

A Mrs. Catherine Rickarby, of Melbourne,
who lives conveniently adjacent to the theatre
and the cable-tram, and presumably has gas and
water laid on, lately wrote to Vic. Council of
Education pointing out that girls ought to engage
in rural work instead of crowding into factories.
In other words, Mrs. Rickarby wants girls to
“go on the land.” The suggestion calls up a
bygone picture in the writer’s mind. It was a
Saturday evening and dusk ; it had been raining
for three days and was still raining, and a wall of
mist rose up before and behind. He was driv-
ing a weary horse and a muddy trap along a
road near Castle Hill, and reckoning dismally
that he would probably persuade the frag-
ment of tired brown meat into Parramatta
somewhere about ten. A cow suddenly emerged
from the gloom in front—a red cross cow with
an indignant tail, and a comely girl of about
20 ran after it with a branch. She had taken off
her boots and stockings to get through the mud
easier. Her head was bare —a country girl hasn’t
enough new hats to waste them in such weather—
and she had a short, sodden skirt which wasted
two graceful legs on the desert air. The writer
struck up an acquaintance, the unshod girl sink-
ing visibly in the mud while she conversed. It
appeared that the cow had strayed, and she had
been looking for it nearly two hours. She had
only a mile co go, she said, and then she banged
the animal on the tail with the branch, and her
two bare heels disappeared into the mist.
This is ! probably one of the reasons why the
average girl isn’t actually screaming for a chance to
go on the land. And if Mrs. Catherine Rickarby—
whose personal acquaintance Theßulletin hasn’t
the honor to possess—will take off her hat, and
her boots and stockings, and her frock, and let
her hair down, and go out in a short brown skirt
with a club in her hand some wet evening,
and chase a bad-tempered cow down the St. Kilda
road half-wa,y to Brighton, and then run after it
all round Elsternvvick, perhaps she will under-
stand what the writer is driving at better than
can be explained in words.

“An active member of a charitable
society,” while congratulating “ Hard-up ” on his
lucid summing up, in The Bulletin, of his im-
pressions of Sydney Charities, maintains _ that
enquiry from neighbors about the recipient’s
habits is an unfortunate necessity. He instances
a case in which, though his society was assisting a
family with both money and food, the children
appeared to remain in a starving condition until
enquiry elicited that the mother regularly drank
the money and then sold the food to buy more
drink. The deserving, it is added, have always
to suffer a little for the faults of the impostor.

Certain members of Sydney Water and
Sewage Board object to supply water free of
charge to alleged charitable institutions which
carry on laundry-work. Quite right. Most of
these institutions.are dens of despair where smug
gentlemen and real lydies, in the holy name of
charity and prison-gate philanthropy, work
broken-down street-walkers, convicted thieves
and drunkards, for long hours without pay. Free
labor and free water make the competition in-
vincible, and only bad work gives the other
laundries a show. Any attempt to revive private
gaols and hiring-out of convict-labor in this
country should be treated as high treason.

N. : “ The Mayor of Melbourne and others
have caused righteous indignation by a ukase that
the Gippsland bush-fire subscriptions are only to
be ladled out by way of loan. How Fatmanic!
The subscribers had not the faintest idea of be-
coming money-lenders. No, the generous impulse
of the subscribers is to relieve distress. The col-
lection of such semi-Shylock philanthropic loans
A PROUD LINEAGE.

WOULD-BE-FACETIOUS LOOKER-ON: “ What’s the pedigree?"
AUCTIONEER: “By Divine Providence, out of condition!”
would be impracticable and impossible. The sub-
scribers provided financial rain for the thirsty
ground. Let it fall, on thrifty and thriftless.”
Also, with regard to the business aspect of the
case—the money is only to be lent. Therefore,
the soulless committee proposes to collect it again
by instalments from the persons now relieved.
When that money comes back it can’t be returned
to the donors, for many of them are unknown.
So who is going to hang on to it, or divert it to
the service of his own little fad, or what is to
become of it?

Hardly anything could bring more forcibly
home to the mind the devastation wrought by the
Gippsland bush fires than the grim joke of one
burnt-out and ruined farmer :
If you want roast beef, pork, veal, lamb, or baked
potatoes, you may get any of them at my place. There is
plenty of it there, and you can help yourselves. In one
heap there are 50 head of milking- cows, all baked. In
another are hundreds of sheep, while the third is com-
posed of many pins and potatoes.
Another sufferer lost, by burning, no fewer than
1600 sheep and 150 head of cattle.

A heated Melb. visionary wrote to the
papers suggesting that the Railway Dept, might
make a sackful of money if it ran special excur-
sions to the fire-ravaged districts in Gippsland.
Cold-blooded Commissioner Mathieson scouted
the idea—it would not be possible to “assure a
view of the flaming forests ” with a certainty of
the excursionists returning. Strange, what a
fascination a big fire has for nine people out of
ten ! Thousands crowded in by train, tram, bike,
and on foot from every suburb, to gloat over the
burning of the great Flinders-lane> soft-goods
houses. There are some people who would go to
Hell, to see the local illuminations, if they could
be sure of getting back.
*-* * *
A glance at the titles of sermons delivered
in Melb. churches during the last few weeks re-
veals a significant fact. Not one of them even
remotely hinted at Sheol. The preachers seemed
to feel that congregations who had sweltered
through the late infernal weather would have
greeted the mention of Hell with scorn and derision.

Dear Bulletin.—How many people pre-
at the recent R.C. function at Waitara
(N.S.W.) were able to appreciate the unconscious
humor of-Card. Moran in hoping that the name
would frequently crop up again in religious affairs ?
Waitara is a Maori word with a distinctly vulgar
purport, which has apparently been maliciously
grafted upon the unsuspecting province of N.S.W.
About half the names of localities in M.L. are un-
mistakeably improper, yet they are repeated in
the most matter-of-fact way by resident's fully
aware of their meanings. But even Grundy-ridden
England has several towns and villages, mention
of which is no less vulgar to the casual stranger.—

A romance in real life comes from a Melb.
pub., identified with the noble art of the bashed
pug and the black eye. A year back the licensee
and his wife went into the Divorce Court, and the
husband succeeded in his petition, and left the
court a triumphant bachelor. Somehow the thing
didn’t prove as good as he expected. Down at the
old home nothing seemed the same. The beer
didn t guggle out of the pump with its pristine
vigor ; the gong he banged on Saturday nights in
the big ring upstairs was set in a minor key • and
the music had gone from the thud of Hooligan’s
fist on the jaw of Maloney. All was so drear and
lonely that a month back the saddened publican
sought out his former wife, and, after a hesitating
proposal, led her once more to the altar as his
blushing bride.

A M.L. doctor has been captured at San
Francisco, after a long stern chase, on the usual
charge of “ performing an illegal operation,” which
chanced to end fatally. It was the usual story.
Susan Sparks was “in trouble,” and applied to
the doctor to get her out of it. He allegedly pro-
ceeded to risk his neck for a small consideration—
or, as his friends allege, for pure charity or chivalry
—on the invariable condition that the matter should
be kept dark. When things went wrong, Susan
Sparks gave him away on her death-bed, as 99 per
cent, of women do under the like circumstances.
In such a case the woman almost invariably breaks
her solemn pledge of secresy, and makes her peace
with Heaven, and does her hardest swear to bring
about the hanging of the man who assisted her,
and then dies in the hope of a blessed resurrection.
This view of the case almost makes one feel a
touch of, sympathy with the shady healer who
lives on abortion. In these days of “lodges” a
good proportion of the profession would starve if
it wasn’t for. the woman who is “in trouble,” and
'competition is so keen that the profession risks its
neck at a marvellously cheap rate nowadays.

Pearson’s Weekly (London) still persists

Yankee paper in a long skit about a Maori prin-
cess who wants to wed a white man. PEARSON S

of the lady, in answer to which the able editor
gives the address of the princess as “Maoriland,

One strange fea-
ture of Australian f
cial life is the per-
fectly casual way in
which men marry for
no ostensible purpose
except the purpose of
vanishing wearily
■round the corner im-
mediately after the
•cereropny. In a Syd-
ney case now on hand,
the husband, it is al-
leged; married in ’.94
and shortly afterwards
made- his tired, indif-
ferent exit round the
■corner and never came
back. In ’96 he mar-
ried-aga.in, and imme-
diately faded away up
the street. He never
lived with'his second
wife. When he was
arrested on a charge
of aggravated harem,
he offered no explana-
tion whatever. Ap-
parently he only did
it because a fellow
must do something,
and, if a cove isn’t
doing something, then
what is a cove to do ?
This perfectly casual
kind of husband is one
of the institutions of
Australia, and not one
of him ever explains
what there is about
the proceeding to
make it worth doing.
And why, in this Land
of the Great Tired
Bloke, any bloke
should take so much
trouble over so very
little is a thing that
no bloke can under-
stand.

One result of the Adelaide Hospital row is
the multiplication of private hospitals in city and
suburbs, at which “ striking ” doctors and recal-
citrant nurses reign supreme: Under present
legislation, there is no check to their increase and
no power of State or municipal supervision.
• * * *
Dr. Russell, the fired-out superintendent
of Adelaide hospital, has a big following ; and his
sudden neek : and-crop ejectment, and some other
recent-incidents, are making many hitherto thick-
and-thin supporters of the Kingston Govt, in the
hospital rumpus waver. The effect can be seen
plainly' in the country papers, which, generally
speaking, are not within the medical unions
influence, and are therefore a fair guide.
For sheer senseless obstructiveness (writes
a Sydney merchant to The Bulletin) it wouldn’t
be easy to beat the refusal of the Sydney
health-authorities to allow telephonic communica-
tion between the .quarantined Caledonien passen-;
gers and their friends in Sydney. Here were
people who had come 14,000 miles, many of them
on imperatively urgent business, and some of
them possibly even on matters of life and death,
while all of them were seriously inconvenienced by
the dislocation of their personal arrangements,
and a dunder-headed officialism refuses them a
means of communication with the outer world,
which not only involves no possible risk to the
public health, but might make a momentous differ-
ence in the""after-lives of those who ought, if possi-
ble, to. have a dozen telephones placed at their
immediate service. Quarantine shouldnt mean
gaol. To refuse the telephone to a quarantined
man is simply to falsely-imprison him.

previous .to this, painted legs of bunk with car-

on the Very same day. Buried in clothes and
boots next day; no clergyman, no service, no
medical examination —though (wonderful to re*
late !) there actually was a coffin !

Sydney isn’t the only city where the re-
signation of the town-clerk is just now directing
public gaze towards municipal ways and means.
At Hobart, Mr. George Steward, formerly Pre-
mier’s secretary, and only lately appointed town
clerk at =£l2o a year better screw than the under-
secretaryship carried, has quietly gone back to his
old post. The ways of aldermen seem to have
disgusted the energetic and well-washed Steward.
Reports made by him as to sanitation, and recom-
mendations submitted re improvements in the
working of municipal machinery, so shocked the
ancient conservatism of the aldermen that they
brought all the weight of a passive antagonism to
bear on the sinner and utterly crushed him.
“They don’t want a town clerk,” says Steward,
“ they require a junior clerk: somebody who will
do as he’s told and ask no questions.” But the
breeze has died away—no violent measures have
been taken to disturb the unholy worship of the
great god, Smother-it-up. Of some hundreds of
insanitary premises officially reported in Hobart
during ’97 only 18 per cent, were attended to. Yet
Hobart professes to wonder where the typhoid
comes from.
Municipal socialism in Hobart, let other cities
do as they list, isn’t in it with Private Enterprise.
The residents in the least dreary section of the
least dreary street in that melancholy village have
clubbed together to employ an active youth as
street-sweeper. This munificent tribute to the
dirtiness of the regime of Eat Aldermen in the
City of Dreadful Stinks is duly lauded by the
“ leading ” daily paper as “ in every respect credit-
able ” to the place !!
“ Many visitors from the mainland,” says a Bul-
letin correspondent, “ this year cleared out of
Hobart almost as soon as they could catch a
steamer. Reasons : Smells innumerable from the
open sewer running through the centre of the
town, and the lack of fairly-sanitary accommoda-
tion far enough away from aforesaid sewer to make
the stink bearable. The hospital cart rumbles
ominously through the streets, and tan bark, to
deaden the sound of the traffic for some fever-
racked patient, occurs too frequently in the public
highways to make anybody want to stay in Hobart
longer than he can help.”

Lord Brassey started the city sewage
system the other day by taking a boy-stood-on-
the-burning-deck attitude on an elevation before a
paunchy multitude, and spinning a wheel. H.E.
performed the function in a manner becoming the
representative of Her Majesty the Queen, and as
the pent-up sewage was heard to gUrgle a cheer
broke from the assembled personages, who imme-
diately partook of the usual luncheon. The
dailies contrived to be quite poetical in describing
this interesting ceremony, and enlarged upon the
running waters, and the balmy breezes, and simi-
lar stock-pot items. This imbecile affair (the flow
of sewage, the capering, EitzGibbon, the speeches,
the vice-regal exhibit, and the feed) is all a ghastly
bad joke on the gubernatorial institution. But
hungry personages are dreadfully dull and humor-
less, and when the sewage was flowing satisfac-
torily, and they were buzzing amongst the victuals,
they all felt that in some way they had served
the Empire again, and it was well with them.

Dear Bulletin, —Re
“ Cole’s ” par. about women
being exasperating shoppers.
When the fine folks from
Penrhyn Castle used to go
shopping into Bangor, N.
Wales (carriage and pair,
livery, &c.), their general
practice was to go into shop
after shop, have the whole
establishment turned over,
and finally buy a penny
real of cotton. One day
Lady Penrhyn and some
friends marched into the
leading draper’s shop and
kept turning up their noses
at all the stuff brought
from all parts of the shop
for their inspection until
the counter was fairly strewn
with goods. Suddenly the
proprietor, who had been
watching the performance
from behind a stack of
tweeds, walked up and
blandly observed :
“ These are my goods,
ladies, and—that’s the
door.” Would that there
were more like him.—

A Sydney lady engaged
a new abigail, who when pre-
liminaries had been settled, re-
marked, “ I should like to have my

smile, “ I suppose you mean your young
man?” “No, I don’t,” replied the girl,
firmly, “I mean my young gentleman!”
And why not ?

Lucky chance for Sydney Argentine Consul
Tillock that an Argentine vessel happened to pass
the Royal Arthur during Tillock’s official visit to
the Admiral. The warship immediately saluted
the flag of the republic, and the proud soul of that
wholesale grocer can now rejoice in the memory
of an additional nine guns.

Working about 14

positions in the world, and the wonder is that ser-
vant girls don’t become broken-down sooner than
they do. Their digestion, however, is always more

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
„ Sydney, February 15, 1898.
Mr Dear Mtee—
At Rushcutter’s Bay Oval on Thursday last a
cricket-contest was languidly fought out between
the Union and Australian Clubs. Both elevens
seemed rather weary, but the Union Clubites
were a shade more tiah’d than their opponents,
who therefore won. Socially, the function was
made interesting—as far as the few fagged-out
spectators could work up an interest in anything
—by the appearance of the new Admiral and Ad-
miral ess. She was clad in stereotyped tailor-
made blue cloth, with unremarkable hat and red
brolly. Englishwomen have always such original
ideas in garmenture. The Admiral looks like the
sort of captain who would be testimonialised and
silver-plated by admiring passengers at the end of
a voyage, and who would “ respond in a few well-
chosen words.” An ex-Gaiety girl set off her
blondness successfully with black and pink ; and a
smart, new, baggy blouse adorned a fawn costume
on a slim Woman. But it wasn’t a dressy outing:
-b ebruary functions never are. Clothes and their
wearers both looked washed-out.
A well-known Sydney lady, who has recently
returned from a Jubilee visit to London, has been
contributing to S.M. Herald her views of some
Ome ways and customs, particularly the great,
evergreen servant-girl trouble, and, wonderful to
u although the writer is from the ranks of
the Missuses, she is bn the side of the local Betsy
Jane. It’s quite refreshing to find a woman with
her eyes and ears wide enough to see and hear for
herself in this unoriginal world. Most women
return from ’Ome singing “Te Deums” to the
~well-trained English servants,” and raise a con-
tinual moan about the impossible “ generals ” of
the benighted colonies. “ Eucalypta so she
signs alleges that the haughty menials of a
London house won’t do half the work which
an Australian slavey gets through in the
course of a working day. The domestic hire-
lings of the Big Smoke take less money, but
more of them have to be boarded and lodged, and
though underlings are seldom privileged to eat
high-priced food as the family,”.yet even
the servant s-hall must see a joint on its table occa-
sionally, and a leg of mutton costs seven shillings
in Merry England. [English servants won’t eat
Australian meat, and they know it when they
see it, while “the family” often don’t.] The
London perfectly - trained ’’ house - machines
are respectful and demure to their betters,
but they have the faults which generations
of servitude have engendered. There is be-
tween missus and her servant an unabridged
gulf quite non-existent in this free-and-easy
land, where the cook of yesterday is the lydy
of to-day, and where Mary Ann from the kitchen,
who departed Westraliawards two years ago, turns
up again as the wife of a gilded mining-expert,
and gets into a classier set than her former em-
ployer.
‘ Eucalypta ” is wrong about the shops,
though, She has the usual plaint of the bargain-
hunting Australienne that “you can get it cheaper
at any Sydney shop ” —a wail which makes the
Cockney more snortful about Antipodean ideas
than any other criticism of his beloved city. And
it isn’t the fact. It’s begging the question to say
that outside Regent and Bond streets there are
very few first-class gown and bonnet paradises, as
those two thoroughfares are the acknowledged
. sh'cm- You might as well say that out-
side David Jones’s and Foy’s and Hordern’s there
are really no big drapers in Sydney. Moreover
there are a few little tape-and-button stores in
London outside the charmed circle. What’s the
matter with suburban Whitely’s, and Silver’s
and Harrod’s? If “Eucalypta - ” had sought out
Mrs. Billolloway, m Bedford Park, she would
have taught her all there is to know about shop-
ping, as that lady is one of the most confirmed
bargain-hunters, and always ready to put an
Australian friend on the right track for the mam-
moth stores.
Mrs. Josephson, the deservedly-popular widow
of udge Josephson, was married on Monday
to Mr. Grimshaw, of the N.S.W. public service,
lhe bride was the third wife of her first husband
and now she is herself going in for a second ven-
ture. As Tweenways, in “The Amazons,” used
to say, they have the marrving bias strongly in
that family,
„ A mild Httle,flutter, suggestive of “ Who killed
Kobm. has arisßii over th© Ferguson
baby’s joy-bells. The inauguratory ding-dong
of a single big bell, rung by some stupid person,
frightened citizens, who peered about for half-
mast flags, and thought it heralded a burying and
not a baby. The only bells set ringing by the
proud papa were telephone bells, for he rang up
all his acquaintances to tell them of the joyful
event. And the question “ Who tolled the bell ? ”
hasn’t yet been satisfactorily answered.
One of Sydney’s best-known and most indefatig-
able dancing-men, Mr. G. Swift, is departing in
the China on a combined business-and-pleasure
trip for 12 months. As a conscientious ball-goer
who thoroughly fills his programmes, and doesn’t
shirk “ duty whirlings,” he is much sought after
by worried hostesses in these days when most
“ sassiety ” men are wall-supporters and smoking-
room fixtures. G. Swift’s season-record is five
hops per week, not counting gipsy-teas and moon-
light harbor trips. Also, as he is a musical person,
he is generally turned on to play “the extras ” in
that hiatus when the band retires to feed itself.
The above facts from the life of a society-shiner
are merely given to show that pleasuring nightly
after the day s biz is over is like knocking off work
to carry bricks.
Albani, the high-priced musical sensation of
next week, will begin warbling on Wednesday,
J eb. 23. At both Adelaide and Melbourne pro-
minent folk are sitting up and giving parties in
her honor, but nothing in a complimentary shivoo
way has yet been fixed for Sydney, except the
Mayoral reception at the Town Hall. The Cana-
dian songstress has chosen a programme for her
opening concert which people seem to like because
it isnt startlingly new, but presents old and
favorite numbers. Mrs. Gye travels under royal
patronage : the smile of Vic. R. never leaves off
beaming on her, just as the royal gift-bangle never
leaves her wrist; and most of the crowned l.pnvL 0 f
Europe have similarly decked the prima-donna.
Several globe-trotting Australians have met Albani
in London, and all note the charm of her manner
in private life. She doesn’t expect every new in-
troducee to fall down and worship her as prima-
donnas are popularly supposed to do. Local
musicians are ruefully regarding the complete oq.
linjiorted along with Albani, reflecting that nativjß
talent might well have got a show in supporting
trie star. However, Australia has no tenor like
Orlando Harley.
Her Majesty’s just now is a bright spot in this
dull and deserted city. It is the only place to go
to, and the few somebodies left turn up there of an
evening among the anybodies and the nobodies for
a friendly chat. Sometimes the singing is loud
enough to drown the d.c. • converse, and then
everybody “ hushes ” everybody, but, on the
whole, a friendly talkee-talkee goes on through the
new “French Maid’s’’ capers. Ranji is a per-
severing play-goer, and rolls his Oriental eyes
from a side-box ; and the d.c. is usually dotted with
resting pros. _On Monday a hilarious male con-
tingent occupied the Gov.’s box, as part of a send-
off to one of them who is going to roam abroad.
A newly-wedded pair were the stars of the circle,
he in white duck and the bride in full rig of cream
silk. -May Pollard, replacing Juliet-Wray in the
cast, gets herself up h la Blanche Massey with
tied-up tow-color curls and clinging satin frocks.
Her white and gold muslin, a poached-eggs har-
mony, has a bunchy waist sash suggesting a bustle,
a horror which threatens us for the coming
season, like a ghostly bird-cage in every show-
room. A gay tricolor frock in satin and spangles
is Ada Reeve’s Casino costume, and though her
scarlet tootsies are fetching, yet it makes me tired
to record that a stage-girl can apparently only be
frivolous in a pointed folly-cap and multitude of
ribbon strings. Bert Gilbert has a more convinc-
ing way than Shand of making love in R.N.
fashion, and Coleman, as the waiter, displays the
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit quite untar-
nished by its few months’ rest.
Ihe latest industry for girls is to be drug-store
assistants, and the first one of her sex to serve in
a chemist’s shop in Sydney is in W. H. Soul’s,
where a natty little sanctum has just been fitted
up in charge of a nurse-uniformed girl who hands
out to lady-customers toilette mysteries and other
things which they would blush to mention to the
young man at the counter. Also, there is a
fitting-room for the trying-on of any required
surgical appliances. So that no woman need limp
about now with a misfit corn-plaster, or grin a
ghastly purple under the wrong shade of rouge
when she can step inside and be accurately fitted
or matched.
Feminine frillery was never more elaborate than
at present. The days of the modest “dozen-of-
each ” wedding outfit are quite vanished. A
Sydney bride wedded this week has been dis-
playing to admiring friends piles of those under-
things which in ’Murka they reproduce photo-
graphically to accompany the penned account of
the wedding, but at which the Australians mere.lv
modestly hint, by demurely remarking that the
best part of the trousseau isn’t on top. Divided
skirts, which are supposed to decorate only the
Jaeger-clad, and in tweed at that, now beautify
non-reticent shop-windows in airy fancy lace and
muslin, and are usually included in every toney
outfit. If rational costume means flannel under-
wear and ugly tweed knickers, then rational
costume as an accomplished fashion is farther off
than ever.
The trouble with conductor Delaney and the
Sydney Liedertafel condenses itself into trebles v.
tobacco. Delaney and his backers wanted to
innovate to the extent of associating female voices
permanently with that tuneful body. The liberal
party think that Liedertafelism as such—that is, a
large crowd of magpie-clad men harmonising in
four-part warblings—is dead as a box-office force ;
they want some new attraction, and the extra
color and life which a women’s choir would give.
But the “ chubby ” element wants to stick to its
old, quiet, humdrum warblings of glees and
catches about bands of comrades marching several
hundred leagues and swallowing several hundred
gallons of lager at the march end, though the only
march the respectable elderly singers do is from
the suburban tram to the office and back. But
they like to uplift their chant at smoking concerts,
and, of course, if ladies are admitted, there will be
no more puffing. And so the conservatives have
black-balled the sex every time, for —“ A woman is
only a woman, but a good cigar is a Smoke.”
The Gregory sisters and other skirted willow-
wielders who intend to take the field against a
theatrical team next month, must feel gratified to
the D.T. silly-season correspondence for giving
them a useful advance-notice. “ Native’s ’’sug-
gestion that a team of. lady cricketers should be
picked to play against the English Eleven in the
test-match was taken seriously and called down
floods of indignant correspondence into the editor’s
box. The enthusiastic girl who helped the English
fielder at the last match by throwing the ball
back from the boundary ought to have had her
say in arranging the proposed humiliation.
Some new music from Paling’s includes “ Dors,
mon Enfant,” a cradle-song by E. de Beaupuis—a
brilliant composition, though a cradle agitated
violently to six-eight time in six flats would surely
be enough to give any infant fits. “Orotava”
waltz is in fairly well-marked time, but the com-
poser of the “Diamond Jubilee’’ waltz is a day
behind the fair in her title; Jubilee stock is dead
now.
The public demand for the “Tin Gee-Gee,”
the song which Miss Fannie Wentworth popu-
larised here, is still strong enough to warrant
Glen and co. publishing an edition of it, graced
with a cover-picture of Fannie on her bike. Also,
Glen and co. send “Soldiers of the Queen,” a jin-
goistic jingle sung with great success by the large-
limbed Edie Hayter in Rickards’ panto.
Compulsory cooking-lessons are advocated now
by drawing-room-meeting agitations, at the insti-
gation of the National Council of Women—osten-
sibly that the working-man of the future may have
his chop properly grilled and his porridge unsinged.
But the sweet, sisterly interest of the Nat. Council
for the working-man’s digestion is quickened by the
thought that the State-trained servant gal will be
a slavey who has been taught to cook at Govt,
expense.
Hospital canvassing will soon be raging. A
house-to-house rounding up of possible subscribers
to the now dormant Consumptive Home move-
ment will start soon, and the woman doctors mean
to hand round their subscription cards on behalf
of a proposed women’s hospital, run by women for
women. The scheme is yet a castle in the air;
the promoters will feel satisfied if they can start.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The Australasian picture of Gov. Brassey in
the waterwas the most treasonably ludicrous thing
ever seen. A photo’d head of the Old Man of the
Sea had been cut out and pasted on paper, and
little crested waves drawn all round it. The digni-
fied, stolid, solemn calm of the expression, and the
absence of all appearance of wetness, suggested
that Uncle Tom was just in his bath, and was
taking pains to keep his hair dry. On the Sun-
beam near, the ladies of his household were
depicted looking on quite calmly, as though they
didn’t care a single rap whether he ever came out
or not.
“The weekly Brassey accident took place as
usual last week. Something went wrong with the
ropes which hold the standard on Govt. House
tower. His Ex., ever anxious to show the uni-
versality of his genius, climbed up the flag-pole
hand-over-hand and adjusted the rope. On coming
down he managed to strain a muscle rather seri-
ously, and has suffered much pain in consequence.
Think of a man with three or five millions shin-
ning up a flag-pole for fun !
“ The Ballaratites became frenziedly excited
over last week’s visit of the delegates to their city.
So frenzied did the local Mayor’s anticipatory
messages to the visitors become that, when a
Melb. official wired to ask for how many should
he provide railway accommodation, he received
the intelligent reply, ‘ City will be brilliantly
illuminated.’ One long train, containing two
delegates and some hundreds of unaccountable
persons, left Spencer-street at 4.20, and a second,
with a few other delegates and still more unac-
countables, left half-an-hour later. When the
first train arrived at Ballarat there was drawn up
on the station an imposing phalanx of assorted
mayors and councillors, with their women-folk—
in a high state of frilly shoulders and new kid
gloves—eager and anxious to make the best
possible impression on the ‘ dellygytes,’’ while, on
the footbridge overhead, a small but extraordi-
narily noisy band rattled chaotio music. The
disappointment which spread over the faces of the
welcoming ones when the 1 unaccountables ’ poured
out of the train with never a delegate visible
among them, was so overwhelming that Mr. and
Mrs. Carruthers and Mr. Peacock, who arrived in
the crush, were allowed to pass unwelcomed.
“At the banquet in the Alfred Hall in the
evening most of the women wore hats and cloaks,
a conspicuous few were in evening dress, and some
sported a compromise between walking-costume
and dinner-dress. Mrs. Carruthers looked ex-
ceedingly well in dove-grey with black hat and
boa. This much-observed lady is slight ar.d
girlish-looking, and towers head and shoulders
above hubby. Mrs. G. H. Reid, Mrs. Isaacs, and
Miss Edith Berry were also much admired by the
gazing throng, who were quite frank in their
audible comments that most of the ladj--visitors
were ‘a shabby set.’ On Saturday, after another
gorgeous spread, there was a garden-party in the
gardens, whereat guests in ulsters and rain-cloaks
wandered about and endeavored to keep from
freezing to death, and thought almost longingly of
the lofty temperature which had been served out
at the Ministerial garden-party only a week
before. Mrs. Shoppee, Mayoress, in copper-silk
shrouded with black lace, made an agreeable
hostess, and seemed to be the calmest person in all
the wildly-excited throng. She was backed up in
her duties by various other mayoresses and many
minor luminaries, all of whom worked at the task
® n !' er^a,n ' n ? the visitors with such enthusiasm
that it won’t be their fault if their beloved city
isn’t chosen as Federal capital, after all.
“Compared with the life-tragedies of doom-
driven Romans and Manxmen, the transient
troubles of the Silver King and his Nellie seem
milk-and-watery. For one thing, Denver in his
gay days is such a pig to look at that spectators
feel nothing but misfortune ad. lib. will ever lick
him into shape. Ugh ! the fattish, beery, and
skittly creature, with his brute of a beard, shiny
top-hat stuck on the back of a sleek curled head
and light-colored dust-coats and frock-coats and
things attracting attention to the wearer’s prone-
ness to ‘ bow-window ’ waistcoat contour. Later
as the supposed murderer, Wilson Barrett, is him-
self again—smooth chin, pale smile and all, thanks
to less bagmanlike toilette tactics, in conjunction
with a few hours’ tribulation, compulsory fasting l
railway adventure, &e. Pity we can’t all, at

“One thing certain, Mrs. Denver (Maud
Jeffries) never drove hubby to drink by dress ex-
travagance. Even before the worst comes to the
worst, her clothes’ colors are all helter-skelter-
grey woollen skirt, blue stuff blouse, black belt
brown cloak, old-hen hat; not that finery is abso-
lutely necessary to the long-suffering Nellie with
more good looks than she has any use for. ’
“’Tis said that, so far as England is concerned,
the dress policy adhered to by Miss Jeffries in her
representations of not over-well-off heroines is
true to fact. One hears of the total lack of
clothes-ambition manifested in Britisli country
towns, provincial churches, &e. In Australia ’tis
otherwise. Dowdiness with us is by no means a
sine qua non of poverty. Summertime, penniless
Australiennes are fresh and starchy ; in Winter
it’s harder to manage, but even ‘then our she-
pauper is more apt to look tawdry than frumpish.

The Suffield Case.
?• S. Larpent: Tiie Bulletin is quite ready to print
. the other side of ihe Suffield case. So far, however, it
is utterly unaware that there is any “ other side ” to
the matter. It is for the Crown to prove Suffield guilty;
it is not for Suffield to defend himself until a clear case
*p r the proseoution has been established. Suppose that
Suffield, on the evidence advanced in support of the charge
of rape, had been sued by Ann Chambers for the support
of an illegitimate child ti>e alleged result of her alleged
encounter with him, would the evidence have been re-
garded as sufficient to establish paternity—in view of the
legal rule that no man shall be taken to be the father of
an illegitimate child on the mere evidence of the mother
a Jone? And suppose the magistrates had affiliated the
child to Suffield, how would the case be regarded oil
appeal by a superior bench which cold-bloodedly weighed
the evidence ?
Writes A. T. Bailey from E. Murchison, W.A. " One
cannot say anything else but that the jury was influenced
by the Judge. And men who can be influenced in such a
case, in such a way, are pot lit to sit on a jury to decide
the fate of their fellow men.’’
Editor Bulletin,— Perusal of the pamphlet in this case
makes a heap of things at once apparent, but one cijscmn-
stance is the awful carelessness displayed by defending
counsel in failing to seize hold of facts. For instance,'
prosecutrix swore that Suffield held her hand* while she
struggled with him—and yet never a word was asked the
doctors if they had observed any marks or bruises OB tret
wrists. Again, the tameness of Suffield’s solicitor tit the
police-court in being “ sat ” upon by the P.M. The only
man who seems to have had any grit is Suffield himself,
when he. declared the proceedings a farce. But the
greatest eye-opener of all is to find twelve enlightened
’possums who, after being browbeaten into giving a yet-
diet for the Crown, crawled out by saying they wert
driven to it by the Judge.— Sievikr, aoulburn, N.S.W.,
Feb, 11, 1898.
The same old girl turned up in Melb, again last week.
Like Mary Jane Hicks and the rest, she was 14 or 15
years old, and she had the perennial yarn of outrage by
burly ruffians. But there were several novel points about
thp young lady’s romance. Despatched from her home
with a cheque to pay a bill, she did not return all night,
though searched for by the police. Next, morning, how-
ever, the missing damsel strolled home in a male suit,
and with her hair eat short, making an extremely pass-
able boy. 'Twas then she unravelled her little romance.
On her way to the creditor two men had accosted her,
and, by a pathetic tale about a dying chyild, had
decoyed her into a vacant house. There she had no sooner
entered the gate than a sponge of chloroform was shoved
over her face and she became insensible. When she
awoke she was lying in a distant suburb, in the middle of
a large garden ; her head was cropped, and her form
clothed in boy's clothes. She then lost no time in getting
home. The story fell so glibly from her lips that even
the cynical detectives were at first inclined to swallow it,
but the young lady’s description of her assailants, down
to the very tins of their boots, seemed a trifle too de-
tailed, and gave rise to a brutal cross-examination. The
beginning of the end was when the “victim” of this
awful outrage failed to account for some chocolate-creams
in her trousers pocket; and ultimately she con-
fessed that the whole yarn was a fabrication. Remark-
ing that she “ wanted to make a sensation,” the girl
explained that with the money entrusted to her she had
bought the boy’s clothes, abandoning her female attire in
aii out-of-the-way paddock. The two burly ruffians,
“ about 25 years of age, with dark coats, light trousers,
lace-up hoots, and light moustaches," were utter figments
of her imagination, the chloroform was a myth, and the
vacant house a fiction. She had simply put on the pant*
and coat, cut off her curls with a purchased scissors, and
walked about till daylight. Medical exapiinatioji
showed—as far as it ever can—that the yarn of outrage
was also bogus. Yet it is upon the mere word of girls
and women that men have been, and are still being,
hanged and flogged and immured in prison for eight
years—like Suffield.

Pointed out by a S.M. Herald correspon-
dent that in an article on Gov. Phillip’s life pub-

He must, therefore, b« the true “discoverer”

“Bob the Fisherman,” otherwise Robert
Watson, whose dead body was found in a Murray

the fire-eating characteristics of his early life
having wholly died out.
Elver Greenough Fry, the Adelaide civil
servant who killed his family and himself last

The case of Lord William Neville and the
promissory notes is chiefly deplored in Hinglish
sassiety circles as an awful example of uppah-class
brainlessness. The dupe who wrote his name to

palpable ass than the noble swindler that asked

The two aldermen, Varcoe and White, who
topped the polls last week in the adjoining muni-
cipalities of Moss Vale and Mittagong, arrived in
Sydney in the same vessel 41 years ago. They
prospected and led diggers’ lives together in
various parts of Australia ; joined the N.S.W.
railway service together, and retired about the
same time. Now, both are “ independent,” and,
within coo-ee of each other, have climbed to the
same spot on the aldermanic poll.

Abbey Altson, who took the
Vic. art scholarship in succession
to Longstaff, has scored a solid
success with high-toned color-work
in Pearson’s Magazine (for Dec.),
illustrating Lewis Morris’s song
“ To Venus, the Evening Star.”
There are four illustrations, very
“ decorative,” yet artistically sane
in sentiment, the faces being evi-
dently drawn from models of the
Morris - Altson persuasion. The
pictures so impressed one of the
proprietors of Pearson’s that he
promptly gave tie artist an £BOO-
- to paint frescoes at his town-
house, and, when a talented Hebrew
gets fairly into the golden swim, he
remains there evermore, as a rule.
If Abbey Altson wants to draw
a large income, he can get the
finest possible models from among the Chosen.
When old Jack Robertson was living at
Watson’s Bay he occasionally missed his boat into
town. Then the residents wondered what had
happened, for the language which resulted
shrouded the town like a pall. John Norton now

his boat. _ And then—well then the locals think
old Jack is alive again.
Primate Smith’s contribution of over£2ooo
of his episcopal income to the general clergy fund
of his diocese parallels the action of Broughton,
Australia’s first bishop. The latter offered for
the same purpose one-half his income 50 years ago,
and although only a quarter was at the time
accepted, he added afterwards to the amount till
his original figure was reached.
A correspondent:—The recent Bulletin
paragraph re Mrs. Humphrey Ward’s parentage is
somewhat mixed. Thomas Arnold’s wife was a
Miss Julia Sorell, daughter of William Sorell,
Registrar of Hobart Supreme Court, and Eliza-
beth, his wife, daughter of old Anthony Fenn
Kemp. The novelist is, therefore, great grand-
daughter of the historic rum-seller.
Hume Cook, M.L.A. (Vic.), gave an
address on “National Character” at Haw-haw-
thorn the other evening. He said that the great
wants of Australians were thoroughness, stability,
definiteness of aim, clear-thinking, and self-
dependence. Also, that they were egotistic, fond
of adulation, and apt to be satisfied with a thin
veneer or superficiality of knowledge. Yet this
is the Hume Cook who used to glory in being
called “a typical Australian native.”

A titled of Gov. Brassey’s staff

before he left Australia. Newspaper inquiries
elicited the information that his lordship was
merely suffering from a bad cold, or something,
together with the injunction that the news was

Fitz-Gibber, Chairman of Melb. Board of
Works, on Gov. Brassey’s accident: —
We also know that His Excellency’s deep and noble
love for the sea is amply reciprocated. For has she not

As the sea where Lord Thomas happened in is
mainly sewer-water and ships’ slops, Fitz’s poetic
simile is nauseous as well as fatuous.
Majah-General Tulloch, boss of the Vic-
torian forces, prior to Holled Smith, seems to be
quite a needy warrior. He was lately granted a
good-service pension of £(>o a year, which looks
rather beneath the dignity of the average retired
majah-general. However, The Bulletin approves
of the extra =£s a month for Tulloch, if necessary.
A man who has to figure freely at official functions

J. H. Gordon, the S. A. delegate, is one
of the most interesting personalities in the Federal
Convention. He is a brilliant speaker, with a
charming musical voice, and will be remembered
as the irreverent person who gave Parkes a well-
earned trouncing at a former Convention. All
the same, Gordon is one of the conspicuous failures
of S. A. politics, owing to his innate laziness. With
the faculty of learnedly rhapsodising for hours
over a sea-shore pebble, he lacks the industry to
master a dry-hash departmental docket. Born in
humbler circumstances, Gordon would have been
a policeman.
James Lainbie, M.A., erstwhile assistant
to Rev. Dr. Strong at Scots Church, Melb., died
at the Athenaeum Club, Sydney, on Friday night
last. On leaving the church Mr. Lainbie joined
the Argus editorial staff; later on he became
attached to S.M. Herald. For long he had been
obviously dying on his feet, but stood up to the
very last—was at work within an hour or two of
his demise, and left the Herald office to “ take a
holiday.” He is now enjoying the working jour-
nalist’s only holiday. The deceased, a man of
brilliant scholastic and high literary attainments,
was of most amiable, though intensely reserved
disposition, and unworldly as the typical scholar.
Sydney Daily Telegraph suffers yet
another important defection from its staff in the
person of leader-writer Harry Taperell, who
returns to his native Maoriland to control the
Wellington Times. For years the Wellington
morning journal has languished as the mouthpiece
of the M.L. Liberals, but the present proprietors
intend to reverse the order, and make tied don and
co. the speaking-trumpets of their paper. Taperell
is just the man to accomplish this. Only 34, he
will be the youngest editor of a metropolitan daily
in Australasia ; the rule—in M.L. especially—is
for a man to attain editorship only when he is get-
ting cobwebs in his hair. “ Tap’s ’’career is another
noteworthy instance of M.L. grit and tenacity of
purpose. He was earning his living on his ninth
birthday, has been office-boy, striker for a black-
smith, tobaoconist’s assistant, wheelwright,
assistant-librarian, clerk, printer’s devil, rab-
biter, scrub-cutter, &c., and, like Henry Law-
son, has “done a bit of painting.” He
theorises that his life is governed by a
seven-years cycle. When first he wandered
into the Wellington Times office for a job
he had to tip-toe to look over the counter,
and the manager told him to call again when he
had grown a bit. Accordingly, he went away to
Masterton, and grew for seven years. After
learning to pick up type and “ sass ” the head-
printer, he returned to Wellington, and put in for
the chief reportership of the Times, Proprietor
Chantrey Harris appreciated the pluck of the lank
youth in the big straw hat, and took him on. Pre-
cisely seven years later, Taperell received a cable
offering him a billet on the Sydney D.T.—where
his dramatic criticism has shown him to be some-
thing more than a mere playhouse reporter —and
seven years to the day had elapsed when another
wire came from the M.L. metropolis holding out
the editorship of the inevitable Times. The long
arm of coincidence reaches still further, but a
theory absolutely proven becomes unpicturesque.

Chief Justice Madden has quashed the
contention of a Melbourne importer that
“ Quaker ” oats are not oatmeal for Customs
duty purposes. Madden’s ruling was, how-
ever, a very kind advt. for the goods. The
learned authority went out of his way to ob-
serve that Quaker oats “ outrivalled ” ordi-
nary oatmeal for making porridge, so an ex-
tract from his Honor’s judgment is bound to
appear shortly on the wrappers, and without
it none will be genuine. Also the local millers
may be expected to arise and rail against Madden’s
taste in porridge oatmeal.
Alone : “It rings in one’s memory un-
pleasantly, the pity and humiliation of it. Von
Mueller made a special request in his will that
flowers should be placed on his grave on the anni-
versaries of his death—he loved them so, the good,
simple-minded old man. On the first anniver-
sary, it is alleged, there was no kind or thoughtful
person in Vic. to put forth a hand to do his
memory this small honor. The one solitary token
(a wreath) was sent from another province.” Yet
the explanation is simple and not wholly dis-
creditable. The world is too busy sending flowers
to live women to send them to dead men.

MICHAEL FLURSCHEIM,
Political Economist.
Photo., Atelier Nienborg, Godesbera.
A valued Bul-
letin correspon
dent sends a note
about Flurscheim
and Singer:—
Michael Flurscheim
(of whom a portrait
appears herewith) is
a thorough - going
Protectionist. He
at tributes'the colos-
sal trading develop-
ment of Germany (of
which country he is
an ardently aggres-
sive protagonist) to
the almost prohibi-
tive tariff introduced
bv Friedrich List,
the great economist,
and claims that Ger-
many is now in a
position similar to
t hat of England when
the latter country
repealed the Corn
Laws. Ignatius Sin-
ger, on the other
hand, is a Freetrader
of Freetraders, a
scientific anarchist, and, by profession, an analytical
chemist. Flurscheim and Singer are the best of friends,
but in their attempts to settle the affairs of the
Universe, and convert each other to his own parti-
cular “ ism," they kept inmates of adjoining cabins
on the s.s. Barbarossa awake during the passage out until
four, five, and six o’clock in the morning. The scientific
anarchist who believes in everybody having his individual
fling, so long as he interferes with nobody else, does not,
apparently, extend the principle to keeping folk awake
on shipboard. Suffice it, however, that the conversion of
either to the views of the other never took place. Flur-
scheim remains a Protectionist; Singer is still a Free-
trader. Besides being a Protectionist, Flurscheim is a
dreamer, a visionary, a believer in spiritualism, a whole-
souled prophet of humanity’s day of jubilee. He is as
earnest about ghosts and clairvoyance as the eten.ial Mr.
Stead. His friend Singer, the author of “ The Story of
My Dictatorship,” being an analytical chemist, applies
the analytical method to ghosts and creeds and opinions
with the same impartiality he would display to a post-
mortemed stomach. Flurscheim is one of the kind-
liest and most benevolent of Hebrew gentle-
men. He goes to Maoriland to establish a Bank
of Credit and Exchange, yet hails ecstatically the
day when “interest” shall be a prehistoric word.
One half of his physiognomy symbolises “Protection,”
the other half the Georgian principle as applied to the
soil, but the nose of Israel accentuates the fact that his
knowledge of the currency question should not be that of
an absolute neophyte. On board the Rotomahana it was
Ignatius Singer, with a keen eye to what was absolutely
necessary, who organised a pleasant little luncheon
to the friends who came down to see him and
his confrere off; but it was the genially visionary
Flurscheim who suggested the champagne, which lent
a cheerful mellowness to the valedictory proceedings.
At the reception tendered the visitors hy the Single-
taxers of Sydney Flurscheim was particularly careful to
avoid the fiscal question ; but when the Freetraders pre-
sent over-brimmed their casual remarks with deification
of the Cobdenistic policy, he restrained himself no longer.
He proclaimed the industrial advancement of Germany as
the absolute outcome of the policy of his friend, List, and
claimed for Protection the indubitable fact that it, and it
only, was the way out for a country whose imports
were greater than its exports. No other way was
there but bankruptcy. Singer is the finer speaker.
His Teutonic accent simply clarifies his enunciation
with an additional carefulness His points are always
telling. He is aggressive, keen, quick, and intellectually
alert. His periods close with a snap, and bristle with
literary and artistic allusion. He is never at a loss.
Physically and facially he is reminiscent of “ Paraguay ’’
Lane. There is much in a reputation. The carriage-
dogs of the reporting staffs chain themselves to the axle
of the well-known’s name The daily press always be-
butters the much greased Hence, Flurscheim, who is
not a too-fluent, or a too-happ.v, speaker, received four
times the space of his much more brilliant co-worker,
Singer.

Here lie the strangled in their quicklime bed—

Despite the sneers of puny punsters, and feeble wits,

Let us hope so—if only to put to shame and con-
fusion the feeble wits and punsters who have dared
to make scurrilous jests about Fitzgibbon and his
city and his sewer. —

The well-known firm of J. C. Ludowici
and Son, Ltd., with its branches in N.S.W., Q.,
Westralia, Tas., and S. Australia, is fighting the
good cause of the local producer by strong, tactful
measures. The firm has done an extraordinary
amount of good work in putting on the market
home-tanned leather of unsurpassed durability and
cheapness, and it is also very active in stirring the
tanning industry into taking active steps to secure
what legislation is needed for its legitimate de-
velopment. At present it is trying to get a Bill
into Parliament to rectify the existing lawful sys-
tem of branding cattle. It has been proved over
and over again that hides are greatly injured by
the present system—ip fact, a beast has only to
change hands a few times in order to get its hide
spoilt with brands.*

Recent dust-storm item from the Mil-
parinka district (far-west N.S.W. on the road to
Gehenna-upon-Styx), as reported in Sturt Re-
corder :
For half an hour it was darker than the darkest night.
I was holding a grey horse by the bit and could not see
him. After he got away from me I lay flat down on the
batter of a tank and tried several times to see my hand
only a few inches from my face, but could discern
nothing.” Another : “My mate and I took shelter in a
tent and lit a candle, but for a minute or two we could
not even see the light, and for some time were unable to
see each other, notwithstanding the candle was still
burning.”
Young man, go on the dust!

A traveller the other day, on the Gipps-
land road, drove past a clergyman’s house. He
saw the gentleman lighting a fire, in the back-
yard, within a dozen yards of a paddock of long,
parched grass. So he got out of bis buggy, and,
unslinging a bucket, went up to the parson and
asked him to let him draw some water from the
well for his horse. Which the good man willingly
permitted. But when the traveller, having drawn
the water, pitched it on to the fire and put it out,
the shepherd ruffled his feathers, and wanted to
know things. “ I was making a fire for my wife,
sir. It is washing-day ” —be was a very poor par-
son —“ and too hot to build a fire in the house.”
“ You’re a fool, for a parson,” said the other.
“ See that paddock ! A spark would set it alight,
and burn the whole country. You ought to know
better.” And then he left. And then the parson,
wroth in his heart, proceeded to relight his fire.
And that night the whole country-side was sweat-
ing to put it out. So that a man may be a good
parson and, at the same time, a blazing idiot—as
this particular parson’s neighbors have realised.

Dear Bulletin, — Re a current discussion.
That hundreds of dead fish could fee found in rivers
in the Tas. fire-area is very probable. They could
not be roasted, but they could, perhaps, be boiled
if the heat was sufficient to make running water
boil—which is hardly likely. Here (Taranaki,
1V1.L.), in 1890, quantities of fish, offspring of im-
ported trout, were found dead in streams flowing
where bush-fires had been fierce, but they were
neither boiled nor roast— been killed by
suffocation owing to the great quantity of asli
from the fires choking their gills. When first found,
they were sound and wholesome food. Probably
the same thing caused the death of the Tas. fish
in question.— Oeta.

A Tas. squatter (verra Scotch), the other

catastrophe.
Dear B. —I
was waiting re-

station, when an
inquisitive over-
strapper fished
from the filter
with a piece of
stick a lump of

which had origi-
nally been about
12in. square. The
understrapper was
then hauled in,
and, after receiv-
ing a severe rat-
ing, he proceeded
to inspect the
filter from a point
of vantage on a
chair. The un-
derstrapper was
only about sft.
tall, the top of
the filter was
much higher, so
of course he
couldn’t take the

whether some fes-

there was always

Scrub-cutting will soon be a thing of the
past in mulga country. Bullocks, with good
handy horns, are being substituted for axemen.
One beast will break down enough mulga in a day
to feed himself and a hundred sheep. The latter
are mostly glutted before the horned-one gets a
show. They dog him from tree to tree, watching
every movement of the limb as he twines his horns
about it, and pouncing on it greedily the moment
it comes down. He may get a mouthful or two,
but mostly he can’t see it for wool. Occasionally
he’ll lie down in disgust. The sheep stand and
stare at him, and some go up and smell him. At
times they’ll lie down, too —all round him ; and
maybe an old ram will go away back to get a good
run on, and fetch him a whack that puts him
on his legs again in no time. A chorus of ex-
pectant baa-ing greets him, and the procession
moves on again.

Writes “Plover: “Re jackasses and

and arrogance. I have seen, not once, but dozens
of times, large snakes killed by jackasses. Not
longer than a month since I saw a 3ft. snake in
jack’s mouth ; on the Hunter, a few years ago, I
saw a black snake, within a few inches of sft. long,
killed by a pair of jackasses—but they didn’t
attempt to take him away, nor yet eat him on the
ground. I have also seen a young jackass with
fully 6 inches of a large lizard protruding from his
mouth, for which, apparently, he had no room
below! By next-morning the lot had been swal-
lowed.”

Dear Bulletin, —Can any bush -naturalist
decide for me what is the real popular Australian
name of Hydrosaurus varius? Is its aboriginal
name “goanna,” or is that merely a corruption of
“ ’guana ” —-itself an abbreviation of “ iguana ”
the great South American edible lizard ? Hydro-
saurus is very far from being an iguana, but that,
of course, would go for nothing in the hap hazard
nomenclature that makes a shrike a “ magpie,”
and calls dasyurus a “ cat.”— Alex. M.

It was the custom on Cross-cut Station to
play cards on Saturday night to decide who should
wash for all hands on Sunday. One night it fell
to “Sonny.” a new hand, and a johnny at that.
Everyone overhauled his kit for soiled duds, and
Sonny bundled ’em all up and carried them down
to the creek to “put ’em in soak till moi'nin’.”
He forgot the tub on the bank—just dumped them
in the pothole. That night it rained “heaven’s
hard,” and just after daylight Big Tom went to
see how Sonny was getting on, and found him
sitting on the bank laughing at a roaring flood.
“What the are yer laughin’ at?” “Why,
dontcherknow, there’s no washing to be done now.
Bai Jove, now, that’s a fine body of watah.”
Then a body met a body. Sonny had a long swim
before he landed, and a long walk after to the
pub. With “ a bottle in each hand ” was the only
way they would allow him to return to the hut.
No one offers to wash even a shirt for a man on
Cross-cut now. It wouldn’t be safe.

Saw a rabbit the other day in the top of a
bush-willow in Tibooburra district. The lowest
branches were sft. from the ground, and the only
way it could have got up (without springing from
another tree) was by climbing the straight trunk.
It ran down the limb and sprang to the ground
like a ’possum. A station-manager told me that
he’s had ’em jump on to his saddle when riding
under trees and that he’s seen them climbing
wire-netting hand-over-hand. This was first ob-
served by a small land-owner, who put his know-
ledge to practical use. He fenced in his run with
wire-netting, giving it a good lean outwards.
Bunny went up and over without trouble, and
soon the old fellow had the whole tribe shunted on
to his neighbors.— Wkekimee,
Some of the joys of the heat-wave
season out-back. One day recently the coach
started from God-forgotten Mil parin' a
(N.S.W.) for Tibooburra. It began the
journey with five horses, but four of them
died on the road, and the remaining animal
and a borrowed dray-horse dragged the
vehicle into Tibooburra many hours behind
time. The Land where the Dead Horse lies !

Jim and I had the carriage to our-
selves as far as Wagga. Jim got out for a
stretch, leaving his bag on the corner seat he
had occupied from Albury. The carriage
filled, and a N.S.W. District Court judge,
violating the unwritten law of travel, move d
Jim’s bag and took the seat. Jim jumped in
as the train started, and, of course, expos-
tulated. His Honor, with a Lord-have-
mercy on-your-soul air, ukased that nothing
less than absolute occupation constituted
pre-emptive right to a seat in a railway
carriage. [A recent English decision con-
flicts with this dictum, the court holding
that inasmuch as it is sometimes necessary
for a passenger to temporarily leave his seat
he should have the right to do so without
being deemed to have thereby vacated it.—
Ed. B.] “You can’t engage a seat here as
you would in a theatre,” said His Honor.
“ Your bag ? Nonsense ! Your bag doesn’t
pay a fare ! You should occupy your seat
if you wish to keep it ! ” At next station
His Honor stood at the window talking to
an acquaintance. Jim slipped into the seat.
His Honor blustered, but Jim, smiling
serenely, said, “The seat was vacant—you
slrould keep your seat if you want to occupy
it.”— Ponte.

Dear 8.,- — Be purchase of “second-
hand ” false-teeth for re-use. The other day
I was chatting with a popular Melb. dentist
when a lad entered with three old sets in
vulcanite, and said, “ Please, mother sez will
you buy these? ” “ No, my boy,” quoth the
dentist, with an assumption of insulted dig-
nity, “ I never buy false teeth like that. If
they had been in gold I might have taken
them for the setting.” The boy looked sur-
prised and crestfallen, and urged “But you
bought some the other day,’’ whereupon he
was violently shooed out of the shop.—Q.

Ethel took to the boards whereon she has broken

debut was at Melbourne Princess ; then she went
“On Change,” title-roled in “Sweet Lavender,”
toured Australia, and was cast into pantomime,
fairly singing the wolf’s claws off in “Red Riding

CYCLES
(Fitted. with 33unlop Tyres).
In connection with these easy-running machines, we have just issued a daintily
got-up brochure, fully illustrated, entitled “ Cycling for Ladies,” containing some
very useful hints for beginners, and for those who are anxious to look as smart
as possible when wheeling. A really good hint given and received at the right
time often decides the all-important question of whether a lady looks awkward or
elegant when cycling. For those interested in cycling from the racing standpoint,
we have also issued a little souvenir booklet, containing an account of the dis-
tinguished
m
rider C. F. Barden, whose appearance ALONE on the scratch mark of the Austral
Wheel Race made the Swift the cynosure of all eyes. This Xmas season we are
sending to all our old customers an entertaining Xmas story, entitled “ Xmas in
Australia ” illustrated by our own special artist. Should any of these esteemed
natrons be accidentally omitted from our list—which is a very long one—a post-
card to any of our depots will command instant attention.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Jew all, who attempted to “scrap” with S.A.
Premier Kingston the other day, was handicapped by
having only stumps for legs—he lost both limbs when
a boy. Yet as an athlete he continued a marvel. Some
years ago,a “fly ” friend found him a small gold-mine. The
fly friend, talking sport to a simple-minded acquaintance
—a new-chum for choice—would eventually offer to pro-
duce a man who would swim 100yds. without wetting his
toes. In nine cases out of ten the wager would be taken
—and Jewell produced. Not only was he a powerful
swimmer, but he sat a horse well, too. Altogether his
head was about the \v>akest part of him.

“ The best pull I ever gave a horse,” said a well-
known jock., the other day, “ was in the Maribyrnong
Stakes, some years ago. Poor old Mick O’Brien had a pot
going on his certainty, but got hopelessly blocked just as
he was going to make his run. ‘ For God’s sake let me
out,’ he fairly screamed. I had a good place, but I looked
at him —never shall I forget that face. I p illed out. He
won. When mv days of bad luck came he never forgot
that pull-out—he stuck to me like a mother, and put me
on my feet again.”

Peter Jackson, quiet and harmless as he was
clever, could stand no malicious allusion to his color.
Having a friendly go one night with an amateur cham-
pion, at the M.A.C., the dark man sparred, while the
amateur fought, and the crowd of “toffs” howled with
delight. Peter stood it all and smiled, until color was
spoken of. Then he looked wild and said: “You call
yourselves gentlemen. You asked me here for a friendly
spar and fair play. But if Mr. — : — wants to make a
fight of it, this dam big, black nigger, as you call me, ’ll
give him fight quick and lively.” The amateur cooled
dow'n and wasn’t taking any.

Porirua (near Wellington, M.L.) possesses a
jockey club, with a racecourse on the,beach, and at race-
meetings the tide plays an important part. The last race
at one of these gatherings was finished in the dark, and
the judge was to be seen craning his head out of the box,
with a lighted match, to spot the winner. After giving
his decision, the owner and rider of the second horse said,
“You know you oughtn’t to have awarded the race to
the first horse.” “ Why not ? ” said the judge. “ Because
he ran inside the last three flags, on account of the sea-
water on the course.” “ Then why didn’t you protest?”
“ Protest! Why, I did the same, and so did the others ! ”

A couple of Melb. bookmakers got into trouble
the other day, through protesting that “ suburban race-
courses are run in a disgraceful way.” The Mentone
management was in question at the time, but the secre-
tary of another suburban club took upon himself to
reprove one of the angry “books,” with the result that
he (the reprover) suffered a left-hind smack fair in the
middle of his official countenance; after which the by-
standing malcontent “ also interfered ” A fine of £1 for
each bookmaker ought to be met by public subscription.
It is well for punters to learn, from the mouth of Ikey
Mo, on opening, that pedy race-meetings are not respect-
able places to lose your money at.

Stoddart’s present team is immensely superior
to his ’95 crowd in one respect, that there are no chronic
drunks. At least two of the previous team came within
this category—one was in such disgrace right through the
tour that the captain threatened to
expo 9 him on his return to England,
and only relented on the return
voyage. The present players are, how-
ever, a steady, hard-working lot, and
they cannot attribute their failure to

Clem. Hill is surely a cricket
prodigy—witness his scores during his,
as yet, brief first-class career. As a
boy of 16 he made 352 (retired) in a
college match, thus wiping out Laver’s
Australian record (since beaten by
Worrall, however). This brought him
promotion to the N. Adelaide club,
the team for which his father once
played, and the boy scored again. Then a player dropped
out of the S. A team through illness, and Clem, jumped
into the vacancy, playing for his province before he was
20 years old. Then Hill—his luck has been good—just
scraped into the Australian Eleven by making 205 for
S.A. against N.S.W. in March, ’96 ; and the boy, rising. 19
years, came out third in the averages of the tour, making
1196 runs for 49 innings, average 27 - 81. Clem, is the
fourth son of John Hill (an enthusiastic Adelaide cricket-
supporter), and has three brothers playing in Adelaide
cricket. Popular old John Hill, moreover, says there are
two more younger than Clem, coming on, but The
Bulletin fears there can he only one Clem.

Storer’s playful habit of appealing at every
third ball is not an outcome of this tour. For the same
thing his county had occasion to “ speak to him
seriously ’’a couple of seasons back. During the third
day oi the last test, Storer became even more aggravating
than usual, crossing the wickets every few minutes to
argue with the umpires that the smoke from the hush-
fires was justifiable cause for stopping the match.

Though prominent in most athletic exercises
Maorilanders are proverbially behindhand at cricket.
Some years ago an English team was playing 22 of the
cricketing flower of Wellington province. Lillywhite and
anoth r Englishman were batting, and had been in for
hours. At 4.30 it struck the local men that they hadn’t
seen any of the non-batting visitors for some time.
Enquiries were made, and it transpired that they had
gone to the Wairarapa—so miles away -on'a trout-fishing
expedition early in the day, leaving, with the greatest
confidence, two of their number to keep the game going.

The cfficjrs of a certain N.S.W. lunatic-asylum
lately arranged a cricket-match with a team from town,
and, being a man short, they ran in a tame lunatic who
was not a bad bat. They put up a good score, and were
winning easily until one of the opposing batsmen lifted
the ball clean out of the ground. The ratty fieldsman
jumped the fence, but instead of throwing the ball over
he put it in his pocket, and sprinted off towards the set-
ting sun. The batsmen proceeded to run it out, while
sundry of the fielding side pursued the lunatic, who, after
a stern cross-country chase, was captured and hauled
back. But the match was all over, as the batsmen had
run 180 and won the match.
A DISCOURAGING FACT.
“You talk about encouraging children. Vy, look ’ere, I bought
my daughter Becky a music-stool, and vould you
believe me, she can’t play one single tune on it.”
A lady-correspondent of a London paper sug-
gests that c.vclistes in lonely places should go provided
with a supply of pepper, “to be dashed instantly into the
eyes of any male brute who appears inclined to molest
them.” Yes, and the chances are that the person to be
blinded would he “ the mildest-mannered man that ever ”
tried to get across the road just as a hysterical woman
was passing.

Latest bike-yarn is of a cycliste who, to get
rid of a persistent masher, jumped off her wheel and
began to examine the pedals. Off in a moment skipped
also the p.m. “Allow me to assist you!” She gave
him the wheel, and, while he was stooping over it, she
quietly punctured his tyre with a hat-pin—then, as soon
as he had found that there was nothing the matter with
her wheel, she mounted and was off, and when the p.m.
.vied to give chase !

Of old-time bowlers, George Martin, of the East
Sydney and Carlton Clubs, came nearest to Jones and
Richardson in pace. The wicket-keepers would not
stand close to the sticks in those days when Martin was
sending them in, and it was not till he was losing his
pace that O'Hanlon came on the field and stood up to
him. Martin on one occasion hit Dave Gregory on the
shin, and ever afterwards Dave wore two leggings on his
.right leg when facing the fast ’uns.
The Nelson-Tozcr-Tomjoe Govt, suppressed all
sweeps, lotteries, etc., and refuse admission to Queensland
of all newspapers containing advts. for same. Still, in
the piebald North, and probably in the South, the Chinee
bank (lottery) flourishes like the yellow heathen himself.
Youths of all ages, and adults of both sexes, put their
sixpences and shillings into these gambles, which are
carried on quite openly under the very noses of the
“ foorce.”
One reason why the Jap brothel and Chinee
bank flourish in N.Q. “Pleeceeman boss, he welly good

“ SURPLUS.”
The term “surplus ’’ is applied, in life insurance
affairs, to the balance, ascertained periodically,
between the assets and the liabilities. Out of this
balance or surplus, distributions of profits are
made to the policy-holders entitled to participate.
The natural tendency of distribution is to diminish
the surplus for the moment ; but in the case of a
prosperous company, the decrease is speedily more
than covered by accessions of profit from various
sources. It is clear, however, that the more
liberal the periodical distributions of profits, the
more gradual will be the growth of the surplus.
Conversely, if a life insurance company withho ds
from its policy-holders the full benefit of the pro-
portion of profits immediately available, and
prefers to accumulate in the interest of future
participants, it follows that the surplus will in-
crease more rapidly in proportion. Of course it
is easy to keep in hand more than the future will
reouire under any possible circumstances; and,
when that course is followed, injustice to present
participants is inevitable.
Now, The Mutual Life of New York, while
careful to make abundant reserves for future
bonuses, has always been equally careful to dis-
tribute to its policy-holders the full immediate
benefits which they are entitled to claim. The
Company has never sacrificed the interests of
policy-holders entitled to immediate participation,
to the formation of an imposing but empirical
surplus, never likely to be required even in the
remotest future. The surplus shown by The
Mutual Life at the end of 1896 was ,£6,105,444.
It is a steadily increasing surplus, which, need-
less to say, is more than ample for all the
demands for which it has been created.
But, supposing the Company had, throughout
its history, acted on the principle which
has been adopted in, at least, one prominent
instance —of reserving a large proportion of the
surplus at every distribution, and, in addition,
reducing the surrender-values allowed for discon-
tinued policies, what does the reader suppose
would have been the amount of The Mutual’s
surplus in 1896 ? Not six millions, but upwards of
24 millions sterling J This is not guesswork. The
figures are based upon the official report issued by
the Insurance Department of the State of New
York, which gives annually the exact recoi' ! of
every company doing business in that State.
Since itsorganisation, The Mutual Life has pan I
in bonuses and surrender values to its policy-holders
.£44,445,244, which is more than twice the amount
paid for similar items by the next largest company.
Observe, then, what a magnificent surplus The
Mutual could nave-exhibited to-day, had an
illiberal policy been pursued in relation to the
assured—a surplus exceeding that of any other
office by more than 150 per cent. But, fortunately,
the Company preferred to sacrifice a mere useless
and vainglorious display to the solid interests of
the policy-holders. Who shall say that, in taking
thiscourse, the Mutual Life of New York has
not chosen the better part? and that, in so doing,
it has not well earned the high reputation which
it has attained in every part of the world as “ the
Policy-holders’ C 0.,” “ the Co. which does the most
good ? ” The intelligent reader will not allow him-
self to be misled by the parading of sums of no
use to the present generation, and in excess of
any possible needs of the generations to come.*

A PARTHIAN SHOT.
“ Any more hints , Ranji ?”


The Trump-Card.
(A LATTER-DAY ALLEGORY.)
By “ Chevron.”
Picture to yourself a luxuriously-fitted chamber
overlooking a well-kept garden, where the butter-
flies flitted and the bees sung gaily in the sunshine.
Gazing abstractedly out of the window, a gaunt,
haggard man lay heavily on a lounge, his head
propped up with pillows, and his whole attitude
bespeaking pain and weariness. So looking, so
reclining, he had passed the daylight hours of
nearly a month, a disappointed man in spite of
his wealth, as indifferent to the unwearing devo-
tion of his attendants as he was to the beauties of
the scene so revealed to him. Apparently he sat
alone; in reality, as Le himself afterwards ex-
plained, there seemed to stand in front of him an
indefinable something—a spectral-like visitor who,
half-remaining in the shadow of the window,
occupied his fleshless, talony hands shuffling a
pack of playing cards. It was' a weird fancy, the
conjuration of a man in the worst stages of some
serious illness, whose nerves had become shattered
and whose brain was throbbing under the pressure
of a dull kind of delirium. Plainly as it appeared
to the victim, that awful shadowy shape had all
the terrible outlines of a skeleton, and was there
preparing the cards for a last game with the inva-
lid before him : DEATH HIMSELF DEALING
TO A HELPLESS OPPONENT A PACKED,
DESPERATE HAND.
Picture to yourself the agony of that poor
creature as he lay there, unwilling and unready, a
compulsory contestant against one who seemed as
invincible. And imagine, if you can, how that
agony grew and grew, day by day, as the battle
between them waxed more and more hopeless.
At last, when this ghastly condition of things
seemed ending, when, grinning in his triumph, the
horrible shape opposite was about to step forward
to throw a presumably conclusive card, there
silently entered the room a beautiful white god-
dess, who, with hand uplifted, her benign brows
supporting a helmet of elaborate design and her
left arm an impregnable shield, glided to the side
of the patient and passed into his trembling grasp
a wonderful magical card. This, guided by the
inspiration of her presence, the racked, tor-
mented sufferer played on the final one of his un-
welcome first visitor, and the game was won : IT
WAS MINERVA’S TRUMP CARD AGAINST
DEBILITY AND DISEASE, AND, IN ITS
PLAYING, ANOTHER LIFE WAS SAVED,
AND DEATH, THE EXPECTANT, ONCE
MORE VANQUISHED.
A Word to the Wise.
Who would envy that poor wretch, rich though
fie was, the awful ordeal of that dread month of
travail? H'is beautiful home, his inviting plea-
sure grounds, of what use were they to him—a
man sacked with pain, and tortured with the
fear that he would never get better ? Who, when
the means of recovery was handy, when the
remedy was available that would restore wasted
energy in even the worst cases, would hesitate to
avail himself of it? Certainly not any person
willing to profit by the following relation of the
experiences of prominent and well-known citizens.
Mr. Cole’s Terrible Illness.
HOW HE SUFFERED AND HOW HE
WAS SAVED.
MINERVA MAKES A MARVELLOUS
CURE.
Almost everyone has heard of Mr. W. H. Cole,
who for so long time ably filled the duties of head
master of the Petersham (C. of E.) school. His was
indeed a bad case : what with overwork, teaching
in the day time and studying in the night—verily
burning the candle at both ends—and severe
mental worry he was so run down that at one time
it looked as though recovery was hopeless. Weak
and debilitated to a degree, his appetite lost and
nervous system shattered, with failing memory
and rapidly-departing interest in his daily avoca-
tion, Mr. Cole had almost given up when an inti-
mate friend advised him to try MINERVA
TONIC.
This advice he acted on, and the happy result
may be imagined from the following letter, which
the saved sufferer wrote in his gratitude to the
manager of the Minerva Company :
“ ‘ Roslyn,’
“ Erazer-Rd.,
“ Lewisham, April 2, ’97.
1 The Manager,
“ The Minerva Co.,
“ Sydney.
“ Dear Sir, —I have derived so much benefit
from the Minerva Tonic that I think it only fair
to write and thank you for the same. 1 have
tried almost every tonic on the market, conse-
quently can speak with some authority, and I
have no hesitation in stating I have never found
anything to approach it either as regards efficacy
or flavor. I am now advancing in years, and
therefore require some stimulants, but since I re-
commenced your Tonic I find nothing else is
necessary. I have taken four bottles with the
result that I feel ten years younger, my appetite
is good, nerves strong, and I sleep soundly.
Whenever I have an opportunity I will gladly
recommend the Minerva Tonic, as I intend always
to keep a bottle in the house. Wishing you every
success,
“ I remain,
“ Yours very truly,
“W. H. COLE.”

Mr. W. Cassin was a Race Secretary.
BUT HAD TO RESIGN THROUGH
ILL-HEALTH.
lIOW MINERVA CAME TO HIS RESCUE.
Mr. Walter Cas?in is one of the best-known
residents of Newcastle, where he was more than
esteemed as Secretary of the local Tattersall’s
Club. Read, mark, and inwardly digest the fol-
lowing eloquent letter :
“ Hunter-street, Newcastle,
“April 28th, 1897.
“ The Manager,
“ The Minerva Company,
“56 Margaret-street,
“ Sydney.
“Dear Sir, —Some months ago 1 was Secretary
of the Newcastle Tattersall’s Club, but was coni-
-1 tolled to give up the position through ill-health.
have now taken three bottles of your Minerva
Tonic, and have thus tested the truth of the state-
ments contained in your advertisements. You
claim for the Tonic that it is powerful enough to
strengthen and build up people who have become
debilitated and weak, and this is just what it did
for me. I feel better, am better, and all my
frien Is tell mo I look better, and T tell them in
turn that Minerva Tonic did it all.
“ Yours truly,
“WALTER CASSIN.”
A Testimonial from the Highest.
Tll v£ £AP 1)INAL ’ S PRIVATE secretary
WRITES IN HONOR OF MINERVA.
The Minerva Company has reason to be proud
of the quality of its testimonials which embrace
names representative of all classes and all con-
ditions of men. This is one from no less an
authority than Very Rev. Hr. O’Haran, Private
Secretary to his Eminence the Cardinal-Arch-
bishop of Sydney:
“ St. Mary’s Cathedral.
.. _ , “ Sydney, October 14th, 1897.
To the Minerva Company,
“ Sydney.
“ Gentlemen,—
I have much pleasure in bearing testimony to
the high value of your Minerva Tonic. During
the holding of the Grand Australian Fair it was
very greatly appreciated here by the Clergy and
others, who found it most palatable and energis-
ing. Everyone who has had experience of it pro-
nounces it admirable.
“ Yours faithfully,
“DENIS F. O’HARAN."
A Famous Public Lecturer,
TESTIFES IN UNRESERVED TERMS TO
THE GOOD DONE HIM BY MINERVA.
Mr. L. Hart, F.R.M.S., late Government
Photographer to the Colony of New South Wales,
and now lecturer to the Bendigo and Ballarat
Schools of Mines and at tho Working Mens’ Col-
lege, Melbourne, writes in the following terms
“ 11 Affleck St., South Yarra, Melbourne.
. April 17th, 1897.
I he Minerva Company.
“Dear Sirs, —
“ Having taken your Tonic at intervals during
the past two years, I have pleasure in being able
to certify that it has proved a distinct success.
Acting upon the recommendation of my medical
adviser to take a tonic when necessary, I choose
the Minerva, and every reason to be satisfied
with the result, so much so that I always keep it
in the house; and when, from stress of work, I
feel run down, I have recourse to the Tonic, which
invariably has the desired effect, and, after a few
doses, I am right again for some months.
“Reeling that the Tonic has done me much
good, it will be a pleasure to recommend it, and I
have no objection to your publishing this report.
“ I am,
“ Yours, etc.,
“ L. HART.”
Queensland Adds its Contribution.
HON. M. H. MORETON TALKS
PLAINLY.
“ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN
WORDS.”
Hon. M. H. Moreton, Samarai, British New
Guinea, one of the best-known gentlemen in public
life in Queensland, writes:
“ Brisbane,
“ November 7th, 1897.
“To the Minerva Company.
“ Dear Sirs,—l am very much pi eased with the
benefit I have received from the use of Minerva
Tonic, and, as ‘actions speak louder than words,’
you may send me one dozen bottles of the Tonic
at once, as I am returning by to-morrow’s steamer.
“Yours faithfully,
“M. H. MORETON.”
Useless Reiteration.
In this way the Minerva Company might con-
tinue almost without cessation, quoting from its
piles and piles of letters from grateful sufferers
whom Minerva Tonic lias positively regenerated
when hope appeared almost as useless. These
embrace testimonials from members of the Legis-
lature, prominent clergymen, and citizens of note,
whose bona-fkles are unquestionable. To this
fact, unique in the history of proprietary medi-
cines, the Sydney press has already drawn atten-
tion in complimentary paragraphs by its own paid
representatives. As instance that well-known
journal
THE SYDNEY EVENING NEWS,
detailed one of the best known of its excellent,
reporting staff to make inquiries into the standing
of the Minerva Company, and of the ladies and
gentlemen who had expressed themselves as cured
through having taken the Tonic. And this is how
it concluded a congratulatory paragraph : “The
Minerva Tonic and Emulsion are two of the
Minerva productions which are finding most sale
and obtaining appkeciative testimonies in all the
colonies. The Company conceived the idea of
making their preparations in large quantities from
prescriptions prepared by the most able physi-
cians who could be retained for the purpose, and
that the result has justified the means is evidenced
by the testimonials received.”
THE SYDNEY SUNDAY TIMES
was equally gracious when drawing particular at-
tention to one of the Minerva Company’s unique
testimonials: “This is a testimonial relating to
Minerva Tonic, and, like other testimonials to the
Company, carries with it the signature oe a
gentleman in a leading position who derived
benefit from taking the Tonic.”
THE SYDNEY FREEMAN’S JOURNAL,
in referring to the excellent qualities of Minerva
Tonic as acknowledged by Very Rev. Dr. O’Haran,
said: “There is little doubt that a proprietary
medicine carrying such evidence as this can be
safely recommended.”
Those are the kind of notices that make the
Minerva Company proud, and with, too, a pride
that is born of conscious merit. Unreserved as
they are, the letters and extracts given speak with
the voice of Stentor, and carry prompt and lasting
conviction.

“AS an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO’S ‘FRUIT
SALT.’ I have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO’S ■ FRUIT SALT’ he now ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.- I remain, yours faith-

POLITICAL
POINTS
“rt ,T r * ter * n London Daily Chronicle :
If all our statesmen were born in the colonies,
Jingoism would be uncontrollable.”
Queensland, Bananaland, Boodleland,
Kanakaland, Slaveland, Mongrelia, Leperland,
Fiebaldland, Niggerland, Japland, &c. Heavens,
what a shower of baptisms ! And now—Tozer-
land.
The postponement of the appointment of
8. A. Agent-General, vice Playford, seems to sup-
port. the rumor that there is dissension in S.A.
Ministry over the rival claims of Holder and
Uockburn.
Sydney Alderman David Davis has a burn-
ing desire to give the Water and Sewerage country
employes a cricketing holiday they haven’t asked
lor. Now, what constituency has Davis in his
prophetic eye?
JAMES SERVICE , M.L.C., OF TO-DAY.
The Bulletin grins to see the Tory Bris-
bane (Q.) Courier editorially calling Queensland
a province ” —a term forced into currency con-
cerning the Australias by this high-kicking paper.
Not a beastly kawliny !
Q. Boss Tozer at Gympie : “ Last year,
too, the Premier and my colleague, Mr. Byrnes,
were called upon to attend the Jubilee functions
in England.” “My colleague, Mr. Byrnes”
called upon himself to attend, if you please.
John Norton is now either selected or is
mentioned for 125 N.S. Wales constituencies.
The only possible way to do him justice is to apply
the referendum to him, or make him a party ques-
tion. Like the fiscal question, he cannot be sunk.
FEDERATION.
Is Federation in the air?
We listen to opinions dinned
By narrow men who bicker there,
And feel it isn’t in the wind.
W. J. Sowden succeeds Finlayson as editor
of S. A. Register. He was formerly a “comip.,”
and, like “ Finny,” worked his way up. Sowden
did brilliant Parliamentary work, and has the
great recommendation of having no political
opinions.
The Daily Telegraph eggs on Premier
Reid to put the Referendum into his armoury;
S.M. Herald says No. The Herald eggs him
on to fill the vacancies in the Leg. Council ; the
D.T. says No. Now, what can a toffy-constitu-
tioned politician like G. H. Reid do ?
The flare-up of the U.S. people about the
German prohibition of American fruit importation
is natural enough. In punching Uncle Sam upon
the fruit-can Cousin Fritz has got home on a
very sensitive place, though, after all, if America
retaliates straight on the sausage, honors will be
pretty easy
Just as "Van Dobson was about to address
the Convention the other day the band at the
Parliamentary garden-party blared out, whereupon
Van gasped, sat down, and said the music had
driven all his ideas out of his head. Van Dobson’s
ideas ! To facilitate business, let the band play
continuously.
Price, M.P. for Gloucester in N.S.W.
Assembly, is a most popular man in his consti-
tuency. Wherever he goes he is feted and pic-
nicked, and kiss-in-the-ring is an ordinary feature
of his triumphal processions through his elector-
ate. An enthusiastic supporter of his gave awav
the secret the other day thuswise : “ The secret of
Price’s popularity lies in the fact that he’s a
single man, and the womer. influence their male
relatives in his favor. But the moment he marries
—he’s ‘ cooked ! ’ ”
Not only in England may an election hinge
upon dog. H. H. Brown will encounter much op-
position in Durham (N.S.W.) because he would
not get the electorate a dog-tax exemption. His
chief opponent is Bennett, of the Dungog
Chronicle. Brown is suspected of edging back
towards the Govt. camp.
Amongst the candidates more or less cer-
tain to contest the next N.S.W. election in the
Protectionist interest are those well-known politi-
cal letter-writers, W. E. Abbott, William Mainer,
K. Scott Ross, John Bergan, I. Reginald Cohen,
Pro Bono Publico, Lover of Liberty, Native, Vox
Populi, A. de Lissa, and Colonna Close.
The Turner Government's path towards a
policy of profitable expenditure ”is being care-

What Melb. Age and Leader have been saying
was said again last week by Mayor M‘Eacharn,
who _ took his cue from friend David Syme.
Coming events cast their speeches before.
While the Fed. Convention delegates were
fighting tooth and nail over Rights of Navigation
and Irrigation in connection with the “ Great
Australian River Murray,” people were driving
almost dry-wheeled over the bed of that mighty
A?-T t 0 the frantic distress of the Customs
officials on Albury bridge. The irony of Nature
again.
How Tozer accepted the Q. Agency-
Generalship, according 1 to Tozer. Medical adviser
said, Holiday and rest,” and T. told Nelson so.
When he “ told Nelson so ” not stated, but “ when
Nelson returned from England he told me he had
to select someone to fill the position of Agent-
General, and asked if I,” &c., &c. Transparent
fake !
Alex. Hay, squatter and ex-M.L.C., who
died in Adelaide the other day, was once one of
Australia’s biggest pastoralists, but recent droughts
must have eaten into his fortune deeply. He
started life as a shepherd, and was one of the
moribund politicians who received their quietus
when the laborites swarmed the polling-booths a
few years ago.
A syndicate, hungry for the paltry profits
of the shilling-a-load sand-carters at S. Melb.
beach, is approaching Lands-Minister Best with a
view to securing a lease and shutting the sand-
carters out. It’s to be hoped that Best will bor-
row backbone enough to resist any attempt to alter
the present method, which works well, and gives
a livelihood to many struggling men.
Now that the Protectionist stock in New
South Wales is going up a little, the party is
suffering from a sudden accession of “dingbat”
candidates, some rapid converts from Freetrade,
some outcasts from the solidarities, and some
adherents recently liberated from gaol. These
will all be used by the daily papers as unanswer-
able arguments against the policy of Protection.
The Federal Convention has apparently
decided to leave the river question where it was.
It has also decided (unless it re-opens the ques-
tion) to leave the railways and the public debts
just where they are now. The Convention solves
pretty nearly all the difficult questions by deciding
to skip over them like a gladsome child, and let
them settle themselves in the dim future anyhow
they can.
Are the Federal delegates sufficiently well-
informed on the danger of introducing the Ameri-
can system of “ tyranny by Supreme Court injunc-
tion ” into the constitution without safety-
valves? The possibility of the danger hasn’t
been properly discussed. Perhaps the delegates
areasunconscious of said danger as they appear
to be of the existence of Queensland tributaries of
the Darling.
Josh Symon, Q.C., so prominent in the
Federal Convention, has an enormous practice at
S.A. bar. He “lays to his book” by keeping
out of politics, unlike his legal rivals, Downer and
Kingston. Symon was landed long ago as the
one remaining member of a big land-syndicate,
and he slaved at his practice for ten years in pay-
ing off the whole liability. He is one of S.A.’s
biggest vignerons.
Quite a number of the Sydney female
abortionist brigade have their addresses at post-
offices, and call regularly for letters. No less
than three of them use one suburban branch-office
in this fashion. Does P.M.G. Holy Joe Cook
know that he officially acts (gratis) as agent for
the battered harridans who take in the lady from
the country, and, if required, murder her infant
afterwards at moderate rates ?
Calico Sargood is back from England with
the latest word from the British investor : he will
be shocked if federated Australia abandons the
“ appeal to the Queen ” ; such action will frighten
•way capital, and stop investment and destroy
confidence. Conservatism in Australia has no
other politics now ; its one policy is to refrain from
shocking the British investor. What price Federa-
tion under the British investor ?
Premier Forrest, at the Federal Conven-
tion, looks like a bullock - driver. Red - faced,
thick - necked, sneerful - mouthed and narrow-
minded, he makes Eastern representatives smile
when he talks Toryism and gibes at popular
franchise. The other day he pooh-poohed the idea
of delegates considering the effect.that the drafted
constitutions might have on their constituents,
“Of course!” retorted Reid, “you have never
given your people a chance of expressing their
opinion of you. When you do, you won’t ‘ pooh-
pooh ’! ”
Re Pritchard Morgan's proposal to create a
North Australia and hand it over to a chartered
company, are Q. M.’sP. Macdonald, Dawson,
Browne, Jackson, Hoolan—also Ned Lowry—to
go with the lot ? And are the Cloncurry, Gilbert
and Woolgar diggers—a pretty tough crowd—to
become servants of the company ; or are they to
be crowded out to make way for coolies ? Further-
more, what’s to become of Croydon? Unless the
perverted Pritchard can settle these things his
scheme —up a tree, anyway—will have to roost on
a branch right out of sight.
Ex-Governor Norman boasts in London
that in all the political crises which occurred
while he governed Queensland it was
his and not his Ministers’ advice
which uniformly prevailed.
Things are still so muddled
there that probably Laming-
ton is continuing the Nor-
man rule.
There are more ways
than the Australian of
looking at the judicial
wing of the Privy Coun-
cil. Chamberlain has been
“ feeling ” certain Aus-
tralians to discover
whether provinces which
use the P.C. Judges could
not be induced to pay
proportionately for the ad-
vantage.. He professes to
take no interest in the ques-
tion of Australia paying
Way. What he wants is that
the total expenses of the judicial
branch of the P.C. shall be distri-
buted pro rata over all the provinces
which admit its authority and claim the
right of appealing to it. Chamberlain is
not illogical. Australia and the Cape should
pay for as much of English goods as they use, or
each should construct its own Federal Court ol
Appeal.
The Dreyfus case actually reeks with sus-
picion. Zola is clamoring for “ papers and per-
sons,” but the French Government obstinately
refuses to produce the incidental documents or to
allow the officers concerned to give evidence.
Zola is being Windeyered and Goulded.
N. ; “ Last night I heard a disquisition on
the Profound Loyalty of Young Australians, not
to their country, but to the person of their gracious
Queen. Of course this was under the shadow of
the Church. Such a glorious thing, this devotion
to Our Lady. How long is she to last ? I hear it
impressed on the young that Americans cannot
possibly be as loyal as English. ‘A country,’
says one enthusiast, ‘is a mere abstraction.’
Well, Queen Victoria is certainly not that, but
she must be abstracted. As Cranmer says of
Baby Elizabeth, in ‘ Henry VIII.,’ —the gods
will claim her.”
A. G. Taylor, the one-time giraffe of
Mudgee, doing two columns of weak blast-and-
milk in the Star on the horrors of Federation
If a man has six teams of bullocks and a driver to
each team the team will progress harmoniously, but
what would be the result if the drivers could indiscrimin-
ately interfere with the different teams—because this is
exactly the change that Federation is designed to make.”
Quite wrong. Australia is only one bullock, and
for the best part of a century six drivers have been
shouting to six different parts of the animal to go
different ways. Federation means that there will
be only one driver, which should be enough for
any one bullock.
Sydney Telegraph, in a recent leading
article entitled “ Mr. Copeland on Protection ” :
“ The exports per head for the three periods re-
ferred to (1881, 1891 and 1896) were respectively:
N.S.W , £2l 95., £22 13s. 9d., and £l7 17s. 4d.
(per head); Victoria, £lB 13s. 6d., £l3 19s. 6d.,
and £l2 Is. What this shows us is that while in
N S. W. production jor export has increased rapidly
under Frcetrade, it lias seriously declined in Vic-
toria under Protection.” By the Telegraph’s
own figures production for export in N.S.W. has
diminished rapidly in N.S.W. from £22 13s. 9d.
per head in 1891 to £l7 17s. 4d. in 1896, and the
great Shoddy organ has the front to call this fall
of nearly £5 per head a “rapid increase.”
BLOOD WILL TELL.—AT THE HIGHLAND
GATHERING .
ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN (to Scottish-Australian, who
has never heard the pipes before ): “ Well,
A lick, what do you th ink of that damned

ALICK : “ It’s no row at all, domned or otherwise.
Ah’ve ne’er h[?]rd them before —but look here,
mion, ah’d follow them to hell! ”
Brisbane (Q.) Worker is making some-
what cynical overtures to ex-Opposition leader
Powers to re-enter politics, and partially coalesce
with the Labor-party as a new united Opposition
—a chance the Labor-party spurned in ’96. Which
action disgusted Powers, and consolidated the
Ministerialists. If Powers will re-assume the
Opposition leadership his followers will spring up
like Roderic Dhu’s men. But his agreement
with the Labor-party must be well before the
elections—still nine months ahead—so that in an
electorate where a straight-out Labor man has the
better,show, a Powers man shall not “split the
/otes ” ; and, on the other part, Labor must con-
cede the straight-out Opposition the same terms.
However, there is a (yet “unconeepted”) “farmers’
party ’ to bn procreated, that threatens to make a
new disturbing element in this wonderful Q.
effervescence.
Jhe dreadful Levi, M.L.C., states that
“ the time has arrived when Victoria should take
action to restore itself to its former state of pro-
sperity,” by borrowing a few millions every year
for the next 10 years. Why, cert’nly. Any coun-
try can get itself into any state of prosperity, if
it only borrows enough every year. The trouble
is that, as the interest bill got bigger, Victoria
would have to borrow more every year to keep
the state of prosperity going. And, finally, a
scared Bull would stop lending, and then the
downfall of Poland wouldn’t be a row of beans by
comparison with the smash that would ensue.
Levi says wildly that if Victoria borrowed a mil-
lion or two annually for 10 years it would only
mean .£30,000 a year extra for interest. Let’s
see ! Two millions a year for 10 years would be
£20,000,000 more debt. And the interest on that,
at 3 per cent., would be £600,000 a year, or just
20 times what Levi says it would be.
Thus San Francisco Wasp :
We can see no reason why, at this stage of our national
development, we should draw any closer to England than
we have in the past century. When the Union needed
friends England was its foe. Now that the growing
strength of the United States causes alarm to despotio
Governments all over the world, it would be a great thing
for England, harassed as she is by great dangers of many
sorts, to form a union of mutual interest with this young
Giant of the West. It would be very convenient to have
a strong alliance with a country which is capable of sup-
plying bread and meat for her millions—a thing she is
unable to do herself. An alliance with England at this
stage of our career, however, would be the most unwise
thing that the United States could engage in. It would
make us a party to the many quarrels that she has on her
hands with European and Asiatic powers, and will be
called upon one day in the not far-distant future to
settle. The wise and the only course for our Government
to pursue is to let things go as they have been going. We
have done pretty well so far.
Blood isn’t always so very much “ thicker than
water,” after all; also, Yankeeland contains, say,
ten million foreign-born residents—with Germany
and Ireland chiefly represented. This calm, cold-
headed contemplation of Britain’s dangers and
difficulties should let a little of the gas out of
the frothy enthusiasts who shriek about the
common interests and inseparable destinies of the
“ Anglo-Saxon race.”

In the Ararat district, Vic., the other day,
there was a Rechabite children’s picnic, which
apparently got lost, for the vans did not
return till four in the morning, when the child-
ren had to find their way home. One poor
little fellow, aged 10, went to sleep on the railway
line, and got his head chopped off. Suppose this
had been a Licensed Victuallers’ picnic !

Public appreciation of that charming mechanical
exactness of RED BIRD is evidence of the fact that
it is a bicycle scientifically and understanding]}' con-
structed. There are many imitations of RED BIRDS.
Some imitate our style, some our color, and some our
advertising.
Imitations are not RED BIRDS, as the public knows.
RED BIRDS are the acknowledged leaders of “ the
wheel of high degree.”
That’s why they are imitated.

High-class agents only wanted in towns where we

WHAT ONE RED BIRD RIDER SAYS OF HIS
MOUNT.
“ The GooiiT) Bicycle Co., Ltd., “ Bth Feb., 1898.
“ King-street, Sydney.
“Dear Sirs, —On the 4th Feb., 1897, I purchased
from your firm a ‘ Red Bird ’ Road Racer, and have
ridden it continuously ever since on roads that are far
from being of the billiard-table variety.
“The wheel has not cost a cent for repairs of any
kind, although having been subjected to repeated
severe strains. The tyres— Electric —are showing
practically but little or no signs of wear; the first
puncture during the time they have been in use
having been sustained to-day, the übiquitous tack,
business end up, being the culprit. That tack has
been secured as a memento. During my cycling
career I have used several makes of wheels, ana have
had numbers under repair; and when I say the wheel
to eclipse the ‘ Red Bird ’ has yet to be constructed I
mean it, and speak from experience.
“ Faithfully yours,
“ W. T. Palmer. ’’

A- London paper published this terrific bellow
over j e before the Ranjitsinhji crowd
went down with those I hree painful thuds and lost the
rubber The whole Anglicised world is ringing to-day
with their glory—with the tale of how they are upholding
the renown of cricketing England against the forces of
the only other country whom we admit as rivals. Mac-
J..iren s luo and Ranji’s 112 notout against New South
Males sent the Australian onlookers into paroxysms of
amazement and delight. Ranji in particular is drawing
boundless admiration. Before the entry of the Indian
Prince to the Australian cricket-lit Id the colonials had
never really known what perfect cricket Was ! Now, when
their own dimmed stars make the cuts and drives that
once delighted them, they will sigh tothemseh os and say,
Ah, hfi.cant do it like Ranjitsinhji!.'.. In the English-
men s brilliant victory by eight wickets peer New South
Males, and in the rest of the games that have been and
are to be played, Australian cricket will 'receive such an
educational influence that will never be forgotten so lon<*
as the game is played in Australia.” Which only goes to
show once more that prophecy is an even more unreliable
occupation than catching the wild alligator by the tail at
6d. per dozen alligators.

Dear Bulletin.—Without any apparent con-
sciousness of “colonial blow” you print such poor pro-
vincial stuff as this: “There are a good many Aus-
tralians who want test-matches won chiefly in order to
spoil John Bull’s insufferable boast that at cricket and
everything else he can whop creation.” Who the dickens
is John Bull in this connection ? Fifteen years ago a
high-toned English cricket amateur brought a team out
here (not an All-England team on its merits) with the
avowed object of recovering “the ashes of English
cricket." Inasmuch as Murdoch and co. had beaten an
All-England team in London by six runs or so, the visi-
tors referred to themselves as representatives of a beaten
country anxious to turn the tables on their conquerors
Mas there anything of the “eternal British braggart”
about the John Bull who came for “ those ashes?” His
team cut up very moderately, and for the next year or
two Australian journalism gloated over the 'aliened
sujireniacy of Our Boys. Then the “ ashes ” went back
to Eng and and remained there, I suppose, seeing that no
Australian Eleven in England has, up to now triumphed
in a series of test-matches. But John Bull's newspapers
have not denied full credit to Australia’s cricket-players.
Only the other day the cable reported sundry English
acknowledgments of the Englishmen’s comparatively bad
play. I have yet to read an Australian confession of a
defeat which wasn’t largely due to bad luck. Anyhow,
John Bull’s bragging is not so essentially spiteful and
vindictive as Young Australia’s “ blow.” it seems to me
that John Bull compares very favorably with Ranjit-
sinhji as a taker of “gruel.” Ranji is a thorough
colonial.”—Sweet ’Omk

(ieo. (riffen stands out of S. A. cricket-team now

penses.” Giff. doesn’t increase his popularity by going
back on his own province, but the gain to S.A.‘ cricket
will he great hi the end. So long as the champion re-
mained captain, ’young bowlers h*d no chance.

Howell, probably Australia s best length-bowler
just now, should be playing for years yet. He is a teeto-
taller to such an extent that his onlv drink is plain
water. Should he go ’Ome with next team, it will much
puzzle the Englishers how such a rabid teetotaller could
have got into an Australian eleven. Howell will And that
his temperance principles will bring him little joy; it
will no doubt he his duty to journey round the different
hotels and collect the drunks. Phillips, by the way,
offered the bee-farmer a billet with Middlesex, but- the
prospect of a trip with an English team is more alluring
at present.

P. : “Struck at the third test (Adelaide) an
enthusiast who had ‘run down for a sight of it’ from
White Cliffs. Which is away back in the N.S.W. Never-

Lightning bowler Jones was a pro. bowler years
ago. An enthusiastic Crystal Brook (S.A.) medico per-
manently engaged Jonah to wreck opposing teams, and
he got remarkable averages in those days. Then he
went to Broken Hill and broke batsmen’s legs on the
hard Silver City wickets with monotonous regularity, but
it was his great football reputation which attracted an
Adelaide club. Directly he secured a footing in cricket,
however, Jonah like Clem. Hill, his clubmate—gave up
the rougher and riskier game.
• * * *
Little Briggs looks back sadly to the time when
he could do pretty well what he liked with Australian
batsmen in this country. Nowadays they do as they
S lease with Briggs. His average in the match with
r.S. W. was 3 for 199.
Wainwright, having suddenly struck form in
Patting, may, perhaps, put up a respectable bowling per-
formance in the final test-match. Thus far, the swarthy
Yorkshireman has taken i wicket for 269 in 11-a-side
games.

A par. in last Bulletin re the weak batting of
the average English professional bowler was made to look
ridiculous by a printer’s error in punctuation. It should
have read : “ The number of professional experts in noth
departments visiting Australia during the past 15 years
oan be counted on the fingers of one hand—Ulyett,
Barnes, Lohmann, Peel, Hayward (full stopj Attewell
and Briggs certainly rank as bowlers and batsmen, but
not much of the latter in comparison with George Palmer,
Midwinter, Giffen, Harry Trott,” &c., Ac. And now the
listof Australians who have done something startling on
both sides of the game must include Howell’s name.
• • • *
Dear Bulletin. —You say “ What’s wrong with
pitting an All Australia second eleven against the Eng-
lishmen?” Nothing is wrong with the suggestion. In
fact, Australia will never be level with the dear old
Muvver Country until she has defeated All England, in
England, with two different elevens in the same season.
I remember that two rival visiting teams, captained by
Stoddart (or W. W. Read) and Shrewsbury respectively,
took the shine out of an Australian Eleven before it
sailed for ’Ome.—Britisuah.
• * • *
Dear Bulletin. —Your correspondent who
speaks of Jones going through the "Lion’s” tail like
rotten cheese can’t have been present in Melbourne the
other Monday afternoon when Richardson and Briggs
were spoiling Jonah's average.—K.

S.S. : “Ranji also put in an evening at Melb.
Princess’s after the last test, but he did not • sit haughtily
forward ’; quite the contrary, he acted the giddy garden
goat, like an escaped schoolboy on a ginger-beer jam-
boree, and frisked about between the acts with a giggle-
some frivolity quite feminine in its effusiveness. He
grinned a large, glittering, innocent grin throughout the
evening, and moved with a giddy little skip suggestive of
exuberant youth. Bubbling boyishness is Ranji’s com-
plaint, apparently, and Captain Stoddart should be
entreated not to spare the rod. By the way, the Ranji
grin should become traditional; he smiles with the width
and insistence of a barmaid who has got 'em ail in ”
* * • *
Ranji being silent, the senior morning paper
took his place as apologist. “ The Indian’s dismissal was
due to the luck of cricket.” "Thecollapse of the English-
men ’—beaten by 239 runs—" was due for the most part
to bad batting,” although immediately afterwards we
hear “ Maclaren was completely beaten all the wav by an
excellent ball from Howell,” and further—" It is doubtful
if Noble ever bowled better in his life.” It reads in
Rank's best style, and almost looks as if the originator of
the fly episode has taken a billet on the Herald staff.
Ranji s remarks on the last match, N.S.W. v.
England were eagerly looked for in Saturday’s morning
PfP ers > ° ut th f.V weren’t there. By the way', Maclaren’s
replj, when asked jocularly “ Where’s the fly ?” is not fit
lor publication.
* * * *
Rumored that the indisposition of a certain
prominent cricketer is the result of a rough-and-tunihle
with a .beastly common professional, who resented some
r, e J”~ r , nla de by the aforesaid superior person, and
. biffed ’■’him.
* * * *
The tour of the Englishmen has been prolific of
, centuries. Ilill, two (200 and 188); Maclaren, six; Ran-
ptsmhj1 ’ three ; Mason, two ; Darling, two ; Druce, two ;
Stoddart, two : and Hirst, Hayward, M'Leod, M’Kenzie
and Gregory one each.

Mackenzie’s 80, 59, 130, and 52 against the

Even the devoutest worshipper of the Austra-

unfitness of banqueting trainer Kelso in a semi-official
manner at Sydney Town Hall. They actually wanted the
Mayor to preside, but have had to be content with the
wagging of the jaw of Ranji Slattery. The attempt to
glorify the obscure Kelso after this absurd fashion is
enough to make everybody of real national or public im-
portance fight very shy hereafter of the “ distinction ”
of being formally entertained by the city of Sydney.

Comforting to hear that the owner of the
Launceston Cup winner didn’t have the “ good fortune ”
to receive a percentage of Tatt.’s sweep-money. The

the race.

It is when Melb. Punch tries to express its
gratitude for a free drink that the slobbersome sassiety
journal becomes humorous. Take this paragraph re a
* leviathan bookmaker : —‘‘ Amongst those who came
back to town this week from Lome is Mr. Alfred Joseph,
who, for a fortnight, was a sort of social king atone of the
leading hotels, and spared no expense in treating his sub-
jcr.ts in a most regal manner, ending up his glorious reign
with a champagne supper on the evening before he left
the township by special coach.” Fat Alf evidently en-
joyed himself after his own heart, and “shouted” his
own praises in a most deserving manner, but why, O why,
did the Paunch sycophant describe him as “assort” of
social king? What sort?

What would happen if the favorite Amiable
were bought by.lkey Mo before the race? At time of
writing, the deal is “ off,’’ and people are wondering
what could have been Mo s intentions towards the New-
market Handicap mare, and whether he has now decided
to make other arrangements. If Amiable runs, may she
not run with a fly on her nose 1

Newhaven, at Bst. 81b., looks a possible “cer-
tainty ” for the City and Suburban Handicap (lj miles),
due on April 20th. Presuming that the Australian cham-
pion has taken kindly to the change of climate and is
being prepared for English Spring engagements, the
value of his City and Suburban chance must be estimated
from the evidence of Australian horse “ form,” as given
by Merman last October. There is no denying
man ranks as a good horse in England,' although the
“ class” of W. R. Wilson's cast-off is still an open ques-
tion. Newhaven, on Australian calculation, is faster than
Merman, who may be in the first class, and Bst. 81b. is a
very favorable handicap for the champion even if he
be no better than the other animal. The Australians are
getting kinder treatment than visiting American racers
received in the time of Iroquois and Foxhall. " .

The Tasmanian R.C. advertises—“ All sailors

It isn’t often that W. R. Wilson gets a good
race out of a horse which has been more or less infirm,
and the public were not disposed to take Resolute very
seriously until he had “ walked in ” for the Futurity
Stakes at Caulfield. Now that Resolute has done some-
thing to justify the tales told of him 16 months ago, when
he was crippled by bad feet, the trouble will be to guess
exactly how good he is, if he doesn't feel unwell. It
looks as though W. R. Wilson and Sam Hordern will
loom large at the V.R.C. meeting—in handicap events,
anyhow.

Glenloth, the ’92 Cup winner, is in work again.
The man who drew him in the big sweep was out-back
fencing, or dam-sinking, and when he returned to the
home station he found ticket and result slip. Having
no chance to lay off he drew the full £27,ooo—with which
he went straight home to his ancestral glen in Scotland
and bought a farm.

Sent ’Ome, the Cambridgeshire and a pot of money would
probably have been at his mercy, and many other races
besides, whereas he was kept here and “ messed.” Now,
at 11 years of age, he has been sold for 300 gs. to do stud-
duty in Queensland. With a few good wins at ’Ome, his
fee would be about the same figure as his present sale
price. '

Earl Rosebery, speaking at the annual Gim-
crack Club dinner, said that winning the Derby in his
year of British Premiership was his chief political crime.
The Nonconformist Conscience wouldn’t have objected to
his horse finishing “ nowhere,” but it couldn’t approve of
a victory under the circumstances. And because the
aforesaid Conscience howled so loudly, he, the horsey
Earl, found himself overthrown at the next election—in
favor of a more sporting party !

The occasional activity of the Sydney police in
their crusade against the tote-shops is a mystery. These
prosecutions and magisterial threatening take place
spasmodically, and leave off just as suddenly. When no
prosecutions are taking place the police aver that in the
present state of the law they are practically powerless,
and urge the amendment of the Betting Houses Suppres-
sion Act. At other times, when the strong blue arm of
justice is in active operation, the public are authorita-
tively told that the police are determined to do their
duty and will carry out the law in the face of all diffi-
culties. Also when a heavy fine is imposed, the Justice
Department frequently remits a portion of it; and, again,
a tote-keeper who has been fined often mysteriously dis-
appears in the eyes of the police, so that the fine really
can’t be collected, yet common folk see that missing indi-
vidual about town daily ! What a howling' farce it all is !
Who gets paid by the tote and double-shops, and how
much doe? he (or they) make a year? One man who used
to turn over scores of thousands annually in the business
—he was a decent fellow, too, whose word would be taken
for anything by anyone who knew him —is represented as
saying that he made a fortune in the tote business, all
right, but he had to pay away so much of it to the powers
that his game wasn’t worth the candle, in the long run.

Q. Postmaster-General Dickson has declared
that all Southern newspapers arriving in Queensland
will be examined for obscene and gambling advts.
at the first post-office in Q. which they reach. Dick-
son startled the local Philistines by denouncing the
anti-gambling Act. He said : “We passed the statute
in a state of sentimental panic. There are expres-
sions in that statute that come within the penalty of
the law, and yet are only ordinary medical terms. . . .
If I were to express my- own private opinion, I should say
that no such statute should exist. I disclaim such censor-
ship, and I should be very glad for the House, in its
wisdom, to re-consider the question.”

AtDrouin (Gippsland), the other day, a trainer
and jockey were charged with cruelty to a horse by affix-
ing to the bridle a “ checker ” or “ pricker ” —apiece of
leather studded with tacks —for the purpose of keeping
the animal from boring. The evidence showed that the
practice was a common one, and fines were imposed.
• « * *
The champion meanness just now in the North
consists in docking the tails of horses and selling the hair.
No man can thoroughly appreciate the despicable cruelty
of this trick unless he has been out West during the fly
season. The era of bloated bank and financial institution
rule has driven all the best of the bushmen class out of
Western Queensland, but no one knew how mean was the
residuum until the above eventuated. By the way, the
Countess of Lathorn, a grande dame of English society,
was killed the other day while driving, through the reins
getting under the tail of her (docked) pony and frighten-
ing it. Had the pony’s tail not been docked, it is im-
probable that the reins would have got out of place.

Once again The Bulletin points out to the
N.S.W. Agricultural Show people the mistake they make
in scheduling prizes for “buggy horse,” and “buggy
horse 15 hands and under.” A 15-hands horse, if good
enough, is big enough to take the open event. If a class
for galloways, 14( hands, were substituted for the 15-
hands event, it would produce one of the most- numerous
and best entries on the programme.

Boxing of the better class has been taking hold
of Sydney in a quiet way for some time past. Fine apart-
ments have been secured almost in the centre of the city,
and negotiations entered into with retired champion
Foley, with the object of forming an Athletic Club on the
lines of the National Sporting Club, London, and the New
York Olympic. Fole.v, during the last score of years and
more, has instructed most of the moneyed and pro-
fessional men of the city, many of whose sons are now in
his hands, and the chib is assured of liberal support.
Boxing contests at the club will only be for a limited
number of rounds, between equally-weighted, scientific,
well-trained men.

The good-hearted boss of a well-known pub and
boxing-hall was taken in by five country-looking young
men. “ Stand us five long beers for a peg (Is.), all we’ve
got—so help me,” said one. It looked straight, and, after
a grumble, the long ’uns were passed over. “ Drink up,
boys, and luck,” said the spokesman, as he coolly placed
a clothes-peg on the counter, smiled, and retired. The
boss was speechless, but when he spoke the air was blue,
and he swears that he will give them a sov. each if they
will call round for that peg.

A well-known M.L. detective, boasting of his
strength and skill, alleges that he can handcuff anybody,
no matter how much stronger than himself. A black-
smith demurs, and a i's wager is made, the ’tec to have
the bracelets on the scoffer inside TOmin. After sparring
and struggling, the blacksmith gets the ’tec over his hip
and throws him hard. ’Tec hits with handcuffsat smith’s
head and misses, but stops a few sledge-hammer clouts
with his eyebrows. The ’tec has to get a week’s leave •
the blacksmith gets the fiver.

The ruling spirit. A N.S.W. country paper
records the departure of a “young tradesman” for St.
Something-or-other’s College, at Sydney, and fervently
concludes that, “with the training he will receive at
college in this respect, we hope to see him one day win
fame among the champion sprinters of Australia.’’

Dead—“Choppy’'Warburton, the well-known
English past-generation long-distance runner. As an
amateur he won 511 prizes, and after he turned profes-
sional he went to America, where he ran in a big 25-miles
race at Buffalo City. Choppy agreed to go down, but
played the “double cross.” When asked why he had
thrown them over, he replied, with a twinkle of the eye :
“ You should have stopped the band. When I heard them
playing ‘ See the Conquering Hero Comes ! ’ I could not
stop.’’ Over distances of three and six miles he beat the
wonder, W. O. George. He covered six miles in 31min.
12$sec. ; and ten miles in 54min. fijsec. Some of his
friends declare that in a private trial he showed them 30
miles inside three hours.

Corr: “The river Yarra, within eight miles of
Melb., is swarming with Murray cod, blackfish, English
and Murray perch, English trout and dugong ! The last
named seem to have migrated there lately. They have
so far as the writer knows, never been 'known in the
Yavra till this season. They give good sport, and are
capital eating.” Dugong? Is this an item in the fish-
lie competition ?

Body, the sturdy M.L. cyclist, rides merely ag
a means towards an end, and that end is the develop-
ment of a submarine boat which he has invented. Body
gets a big machine and tire allowance, and his winning*
tot up high, .so he will probably be about the first inventor
in the world to run his own show and reap the profit or
loss of his own brains. The average inventor of a revolu-
tionising idea gets £lOO -while the financiers of that £lOO
draw £lOO,OOO apiece.

The bolting bike increases in numbers. A Melb.
man the other day, while wheeling down hill, lost control
and found th side of a shed and concussion of the brain.
Bikists generally don't seem to know (remarks a Bulletin
correspondent) that by simply putting the toe of the shoe
under the fork crown and pressing the sole on the tyre, a
bolting machine can be at once “pulled up,” while, at
the worst, only a very harmless spill can result.

God and one divine person, I would acknowledge
the attempted assault. I did attempt to kick
him.” This is what comes of tangling your intel-

Sydney adherents of the “New Church
signified by the New Jerusalem in the Revelation ”
(the denomination’s official title when it is all out)
crept from their accustomed resting-place, the
other day, and jubilated over the foundation-stone
of a new sarcophagus. Hitherto they have been
entombed in the local Temperance Hall, along
with the 1.0.G.T.’s and L.O.L.’s, together with
the Sons and Daughters of Rechab, and dear
Mister Knapp ; and the week-day odor of tripe-
and-onions from the adjacent hash-house merely
gave place on Sundays to the discordant psalmody
of half-a-dozen antagonistic sects. The afore-
mentioned ceremony resurrected well-meaning
hobbyist W. J. Spencer, who once endeavored to
reform the universe in one month by means of a
forlorn Sydney weekly journal crippled with bi-
metallism, and at least two other hopeless fads.
And, of course, Bro. Spencer was at pains to point
out that theirs was the one and only Church, and
the corner-stone of all true religion—statements
which have been so frequently and painfully re-
iterated by Bishop Bobcab Smith, Card. Moran,
and other interested persons that The Bulletin
is becoming quite confused. Also, Bro. Spencer
claimed that the followers of Swedenborg made a
speciality of elucidating “ the divine sense of the
word of God, even where it did not appear on the
surface ” —which exactly defines this misguided
journal’s grudge against creeds in general. How-
ever, so long as the New Church makes no more
show of elucidation than heretofore, and settles
down comfortably into its new sarcophagus with-
out trying to kick open the lid, The Bulletin
doesn’t mind.

“ Hundreds of lives are ruined and many homes
are rendered desolate by 'continued and wilful
neglect of the ordinary precaution against ill-
health.
Many people have heavy doctors’ bills to meet;
and are never free from sickness, pain and worry,
when, by just taking a commonsense view of the
matter, they will find that they wijl have a per-
manent and speedy Cure almost at their doors,
which, while renewing the BLOOM OE HEALTH
AND VIGOR, improving the body and mind,
costs but a trifle.
How often we see strong
men in the prime of life
suddenly
Stagger in the Street,,
and, on arriving at their
homes, find that they are
in for perhaps at least a
long and painful illness,
the cause, no doubt, of
neglected disorders, which
have for sometime past
been devouring their mind
and reducing their
strength. Cases of this
kind occur daily, and an

How to excel at Billiards.
Only a few days ago a wonderful game of
billiards' was witnessed in one of the principal
billiard saloons in this city, which fairly astonished
everyone present, inasmuch as one of the players
■ was known to suffer from a long-standing nervous
affection, so much so that he could scarcely hold
the cup in his hand ; but notwithstanding this he
offered his opponent (who was a professional) 50
in 100, and beat him by 20. And he gave Herr
Rassmussen’s Alfaline Vitality Pills the
credit for his wonderful improvement.

•• I have tested the HAPSBURG PIANOS in all the

Court have been much pleased by the quality and sweet-
ness of the Instrument.
Mrs. KENION will have much pleasure in recommend-
ing the HAPSBURG PIANOS.
Theatre Royal, 28th July, 1883.
I congratulate you on your successful introduction of
the HAPSBURG iron-framed Pianofortes. I have used
several of them in different towns, and have invariably
found them all that could be desired in a first-class Piano-
forte. Being extremely powerful, sweet, and clear in
tone, the touch is elastic and sympathetic ; and, although
tuned above concert-pitch (a test which, few-Pianos will
stand), I can always depend upon the HAPSBURG
PIANOS remaining well in tune. I can strongly recom-
mend the HAPSBURG Pianos to anyone desiring a first-
class instrument at a very reasonable price.—I remain,
gentlemen, yours, etc.,
J. A. DELANEY, Conductor Montagu-Turner
Opera Company.
| Sir WILLIAM C. ROBINSON, Governor of South Aus-
tralia, has given his unqualified approval of the HAPS-
BURG PIANOS, after careful examination. This being
duiy reported in the two Adelaide papers, a storm of cor-
respondence ensued from jealous competitors. The good
opinion of the talented composer of “Unfurl the Flag"
may well be highly esteemed.
Sir ARTHUR PALMER, Acting-Governor of Queens-
land, expressed his satisfaction, and purchased a HAPS-
BURG for his own use on account of its special sweetness.
From M. HENRY KOWALSKT, the talented composer
of ihe well-known “ Marche Hongroise ” and others, a
member of the Jury of Class 13.(musical instruments),
Centennial Exhibition, Melbourne
Sydney, 18th May, 1890.
In answer to your inquiry concerning the qualities of
the HAPSBURG PIANOS, I will say that they possess a
good musical tone, easy touch, and can occupy a superior
stand amongst the great number of instruments imported
into Australia. I consider that they are durable, their
mechanism showing every element which constitutes a
careful work and conscientious making.
I remain, Sir, y ours truly,
HENRI KOWALSKI.
From Signor ROBERTO lIAZON, the eminent musician
and composer, conductor of the Philharmonic Society,
formerly conductor of Orchestra in Teatro Della Scala,
Milan, leading theatre of Italy, and largest in Europe :
Sydney, Bth August, 1889.
Having had experience of the HAPSBURG PIANOS in
many places, I preferred to purchase one here for my own
house. I have much pleasure to say that it is in all re-
spects a very perfect instrument. The construction and
mechanique ate suited to this climate. I commend them
for the splendid finish and faithful workmanship. The
tone and power cannot be excelled.
R. HAZON,
From the Royal Conservatoire of Milan, Italy.
Rev. W. G. LAWES, New Guinea, writes:—Port Mores-
by, February- 19th, 1880. —The PIANO purchased from

ably well.
Rev. J. LEVY, 137 Phillip-st., Sydney:—l beg to inform
y’ou that the HAPSBURG PIANO I purchased from you
is highly toned, and is to my entire satisfaction, and I can
confidently recommend them to the public.
Rev. HENRY JOBSON, St. John’s Vicarage, Cowra, 12th
August, 1889.
The PIANO mentioned was purchased by me for one of
my parishioners, Mr. Robert Brien, Back’ Creek, Cowra.
It gives every satisfaction, and they seem very pleased
with it.
Very Rev. J. T. MARRIOTT, D.D., Dean of Bathurst,
N.S.W., 13th August, 1889.
The HAPSBURG PIANO supplied to me three years
afro by you has iriven satisfaction. Its tone has been
much admired, and it stood the test of the last extremely
dry season without the slightest injury.
Rev, J HORNSBY-SPEAR, St. Peter’s Parsonage, Mount
Victoria, N.S.W., 2nd April, 1890.
I purchased a HAPSBURG PIANO from you eight years
ago, and although it has been constantly in use, and has
borne the brunt of at least six journeys (some of them
very long ones), yet it appears to me to be in as perfect
order, condition, and tone as when it first left your ware-
house. (This gentleman also mentioned that the piano
had only required tuning once during the eight years.)
Rev. R. THOMSON, The Manse, Tenterfield.
The HAPSBURG PIANO which I obtained from you
has given us every satisfaction. It seems to be excep-
tionally economical in the matter of tuning.
Rev. JAS. S. SCOTT, The Manse, Woodburn, R.R.
I cannot speak too highly of your HAPSBURG PIANOS.
A better-toned instrument I have never heard than the
one you supplied to me. Since I got it the flood-waters
have been twice in the house, the piano being simply
removed above water-mark, and yet it retains the same
surpassing brilliancy of tone and high exterior polish.
Rev. CHAS. H. GIBSON, M.A.
Macdonaldtown, March 11,1890.
I have much pleasure in informing you that the
HAPSBURG PIANO you sent me five years ago has
given entire satisfaction. It is a very fine instrument,
sweet tone, and easily kept in tune.
Rev. JAMES MOSS, Ladies’ College,
Waverley, 28th July, 1890.
We have had one of Beale and Co.’s HAPSBURG
PIANOS in constant use in our school during the last six
years, and have thus proved that the instrument is good
in tone and durable in quality.
Rev. MATTHEW MADDERN,
Orange, July 31st, 1890
I have much pleasure in certifying that the HAPS-
BURG PIANO which I purchased from you seven years
ago is a capital instrument, and seems to improve in
sweetness and mellowness of tone with age. It is a
charming piano, and though I have moved it about in
my itinerating life to all points of the compass, and it
has been in all varieties of climate, nothing seems to
knock it out of tune or repair.
Rev. JAS. MATHESON, Archdeacon,
The Rectory, Warwick (Q.).
I desire to convey to you the hearty thanks of myself
and the other members of my committee for your kind-
ness in lending us, on the occasion of both concerts,
and also during the several days on which the bazaar
was held, one of your famed HAPSBURG PIANOS. The
music rendered on such an instrument was a real treat,
and considerably enhanced the success of the several
benefits, which, you will be glad to hear, have resulted
in furnishing sufficient money for the object required.
Rev. J. O. WARNER, Parsonage,
Warwick, Q.
I may say that we are very much pleased with our
HAPSBURG. It keeps its tone well, and is as sweet to-
day as when it was first received. We can speak very
highly of it now, and we trust and expect that we will
always be able to do so.
Rev. HENRY PLUME, M.A.,
Vicar of St. James’s, Townsville, Q.
I have great pleasure in testifying to the superior
quality and tone of the HAPSBURG PIANO forwarded
to me by your firm in Townsville. It has been in my
drawing-room through two dry and wet seasons, and yet
has not only preserved, but improved, its original quality
and tone. I do not know of any other piano so well cal-
culated to stand the trying seasons of the tropics as the
Hapsburg.

The Rev. Mother of St. Joseph's Convent, West Kemp-

Richards, the British M.p. who was the
recipient of a certain amount of subdued grovel
on his recent visit to Australia, has been stating
that, but for the beastly Labor ' parties, Australia
would have a population of 25 millions instead of
only five. Probably it would flabbergast this
weird character to know that it is only eight years
since Labor parties really appeared in Australian
politics, and since they appeared (going by the
latest available returns, from 1891 to ’96) the
population of the country has been increasing by
just about as many per annum as it did in the
boom-time from ’Bl to ! 90, and by a lot more per
annum than it ever did before ’Bl- when -there
was no Labor-party. Therefore The Bulletin re-
gards Richards, M.P., rather -in sorrow than in
anger, as an ignorant and dunder-headed lout. At
the same time, it trusts that these well-deserved
remarks won’t create any ill-feeling.

A Languishing Lady.
fIOW SHE LOST FLESH AND BECAME
PALE AND PALLID.
A HINT FOR A FAIR ONE’S TOILET.
Since the days of Eve the acquisition of perfect
health and beauty of form has been the desidera-
turn of every woman. Ninon del’Enalos, the
celebrated French beauty, attributed her health
and beauty of form to the care which she bestowed
upon her toilette. In these latter days Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People have come
to be regarded as an indispensable adjunct to a
lady’s dressing-table, and to those suffering from
the many ailments peculiar to her sex. In sup-
port of the statement we append the case of Miss
May Dickenson, who was miraculously cured of a
very obstinate case of anaemia.
Miss May Dickenson was born at Soldier’s
Hill, Ballarat, Victoria, some eighteen years
ago, and lived there up to three years since,
Dr.
Williams’
when her family removed to Tasmania, her
father having purchased a selection on the
“Seven.” Shortly after her arrival in the tight
little island, Miss Dickenson commenced to ex-
perience very uncertain health, which, as time
went on, showed no improvement, and caused her
parents considerable anxiety. Medical advice was
sought, and various tonics advised and taken, but
without any noticeable result. In the early part
of the year, change of air was advised and Miss
Dickenson came back to Victoria, with a hope
that her native air would succeed when “doctors’
medicine ” had failed.
Having some relations in Essex-street, Ballarat
East, Miss Dickenson took up her residence with
them. Still she continued unwell, and again
medical advice had to be obtained. Unable to
take solid nourishment, she lost flesh to such an
extent as to make it a labor to undertake any
exertion. Nothing is more weakening than
anaemia, or poorness of blood. Energy departs
and leaves listlessness to fill its place, the blood
goes from one’s lips and tongue, and a terrible
pallor, ghastly to behold, is the result.
“ Could you not seek any nourishment?” asked
the representative, who met Miss Dickenson at
her aunt’s, Newry-street, North Fitzroy.
“ Well, a little, but most of it refused to stay.
I had pains in my back, and had to sleep on mv
side.” J
‘‘Did you see any medical men in Melbourne ? ”
Ves, one, who said I was overgrowing my
strength, and gave me a tonic ; but in spite of all
advice and medicine, nothing would stay on my
stomach. One day I was in a chemist’s in Bruns-
wick-street getting a prescription made up, and
the dispenser asked me if I had suffered much
On my replying in the affirmative, he said
‘ Why don’t you try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills?’
Somehow that took a hold on me, and I pur-
chased a box, and commenced to take them
instead of my physic.”
fit?
Did you receive ben-
“ Yes ; shortly after I
commenced to take them
I experienced a vast im-
provement, and within a-
few days I ate my first
substantial meal for IS
months. In a week I
gained 61b. in weight,
and I kept on improving
until three weeks since,
when I felt justified in
discontinuing them, hav-
ing taken seven boxes. ”
“ And you consider
yourself fully cured ? ”
“ Undoubtedly; and I
can imagine the surprise
my friends will receive
when I return to my
parents next month.”
Complimenting Miss
Dickenson on her very
evident robust health,
the representative re-
tired.
In the Toils of Indigestion.
WHAT BUSINESS MEN FREQUENTLY
SUFFER FROM.
A TALE WORTH READING.
A reporter called on Mr. Green at his home in
Newtown the other day, and, on making himself
known, he asked :
“ Is it true that you have been suffering for over
four years from indigestion, Mr. Green ? ”
“ It is, indeed ; and it has been so bad at times
that I have often felt tempted to go up to a
stranger in the street and get him to punch me in
the back. I have often had friends to do it, and,
Bimple as it was, it gave me relief for a time.” ’
“ Did you have any other ailment at the time.
Mr. Green ? ” '
“ Yes, I also suffered from a nasty cough in the
i
summer time ; it
was also on me, on
and off, for about
the same time as
the indigestion.
As an example, I
would cough, and
immediately a lot
of thick, black
phlegm would fly
up into mymouth.
I presume it came
from my chest, on
account of the
ticklish feeling I
would feel there.
For that, I have
taken numerous
concoctions, in-
cluding cod-liver
oil, which did me no good ; but now I am thank-
ful to say I feel grand, and hope the cough will not
return. In one sense I miss it, as I have been
acquainted with it so long; but it is a very
welcome miss.”
“To what do you attribute this marvellous,
happy alteration in your health, Mr. Green?”
“ To one medicine alone, and that is Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills for Pale People ; for from nearly
the first pill I felt relief and an improvement in
my appetite. I went steadily on taking them
until I got as I am now; and there doesn’t seem
much the matter with me, does there ?/’
“Indeed, no, Mr. Green; you look the very
picture of health and strength.’’
“I feel so, and I assure you that I have such
unbounded faith in their restorative properties
that I have recommended them to plenty of my
customers, numbers of whom are taking them,
observing the wonderful improvement in my health
and condition. Why, I have actually gained 1/flb.
in weight since taking them, and I continue to put
on weight daily. I learnt of them first through
an advertisement in one of the papers, and I can
truthfully state that they have done all and more
than I expected them to do.”

A STORY FOR SCHOOLGIRLS.
Miss Alice Marner, of Victoria-road, Auburn,
Vic., said recently to a reporter that she had com-
menced two years previous to feel very ill after
returning home from school. “I did not feel
sufficiently unwell to take to bed, but experienced
a continued languid feeling that made me most
miserable. Father took me to see a medical
man, and he said I was overgrowing my strength,
and I was not to exert myself. As I had no in-
clination to do so, there was no fear of my dis-
obeying this order, and I took the ‘ quinine tonic ’
given me with regularity. Then I commenced to
feel a lot of pains in my shoulders and back, and
at night I could scarcely get any rest. ”
“We tried everything to induce sleep,” inter-
posed Mr. Marner, “but it had no effect, and
then I consulted a well-known Collins-street prac-
titioner. He said my daughter was suffering
principally from weakness, and advised a change.
Her mother took her to Queensland, but she re-
turned looking worse than she went. Shortly
after passing her sixteenth birthday she became
worse, retching on rising in the morning. Any
food taken could not be kept down ; she lost flesh,
and became a mere ghost of her former self.”
“This time last year,” said Miss Alice, “I
weighed 7st. 31b., now I am 9st. 71b.”
“No ; all the medicine I got did me very little
good. Actually Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
deserve that credit. Just before the Jubi-
lee holidays last year father bought me a box of
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills at Mr. Pleasance’s,
Chapel-street, Prahran. They did me so much
good that I continued with them. It is four
months since I discontinued taking them, and I
am now as healthy as anyone could wish to be.
I merely speak from experience, but that has satis-
fied me.”

Locomotor Ataxia.
STILL ANOTHER CURE.
THE CASE OF A DOUBLE BAY LADY.
Travelling has now become so pleasant, popular,
and accessible that nearly everyone goes away to
the country or to another colony for an annual
holiday. Mrs. Denver, now in Sydney, came over
from Tasmania some years ago, but her stay in
Sydney was. not destined to be free of trouble.
Whilst residing in Hobart, Tasmania, she had a
nasty fall which seriously injured her spine, and
about two years afterwards very distressing symp-
toms began to appear. Mrs. Denver, on being
interviewed with reference to the same, proceeded
as follows :—“I commenced to suffer from great
weakness and dizziness, and an intolerable feeling
of exhaustion; in fact, I felt so nervous and
uneasy that I feared to cross the street,
alarmed that I might meet with si me
accident from a passing vehicle. Not at first
recognising the really serious condition to
which I was reduced, I did not seek medical
attendance, but, when I at last became
aware of my serious condition, I was persuaded
by my friends to go to the Sydney Hospital, where
I remained two months without receiving any per-
manent benefit. On leaving the hospital I again
rather neglected my state of health, and on apply-
ing for re-admission was informed that my case
was perfectly hopeless. Being, unfortunately, not
over-blessed with this world’s goods, I obtained
admission to the Newington Asylum, where I re-
mained seven months ; yet still I got no better,
being unable to swallow any nourishing food. I
then took two courses of electric baths, for which
I paid six guineas, and after them, with the ex-
ception of some slight alleviation of my suffering,
I cannot say that they did me much good ; in
fact, I could not even walk, so I returned home
feeling very despondent, and imagining that
there was no cure in store for me. One day,
on reading the daily paper, I noticed an account
of a marvellous recovery effected by Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and considering
that this case (the one of Boiler-maker Jarvis,
suffering from Locomotor Ataxia) closely resem-
bling mine, I determined to make a trial of them,
and sent a boy from the house to buy some for me.
I experienced relief from the first box, and have
steadily improved ever since; my appetite re-
turned, and I ceased to suffer from that terrible
feeling of nervousness. lam now in my seventh
box, and I can confidently assert that I am most
most decidedly improved in health. My friends
also notice a marked improvement in my condi-
tion, and this I entirely attribute to the health-
giving properties of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills; in
fact, it must be Bolely due to them, for I have
For
tried no other remedy. The proprietors of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are at perfect liberty to make

for I feel deeply grateful for the benefit I have
derived from them.”
A Suffering Selector.
TORTURED EOR TWENTY-TWO YEARS.
BY THE HORRORS OF BRIGHT’S
DISEASE.
“Is it a fact,” said the Mayor of Walcha re-
cently to a selector named Mr. Denis Walsh,
“that you have been cured by Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills ? ”
“It is,” he replied. “ I was in great pain for a
considerable period, but now I can do any amount
of hard work with the greatest of ease. I first
felt the pain after being thrown from a horse, and
was laid up for eight months. I tried almost
everything without receiving any benefit.”
“And what is your object in giving an un-
solicited testimonial?”
“ Simply that others may derive benefit by the
same means. For a long time I was in such
frightful agony that I could do nothing. I had to
crawl to a log to get on my horse. I could not
hold myself upright. I saw different doctors. One
told me that my spine had been injured, and that
I should have to undergo an operation. Another
said that I had Bright’s disease. After a time I
saw Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills advertised. I tried
to get a box, but none kept them in Walcha, so I
sent direct to Sydney for the first two boxes. After
taking the first box I obtained relief, and con-
tinued to do so until completely cured. I have
used five boxes in all. Life is now a pleasure. I
can mount my horse with ease, raise heavy logs,
and I feel as well as ever. I have recommended
the pills to others sufferers to their great benefit.
While taking the pills I followed the directions
given on each box. Many people I know have
taken them without adhering to the instructions,
and have obtained no relief. Rubbing did me no
good; but, after taking Dr. Williams’ l’iuk Pills,
I was convinced that my complaint was caused by
the state of my blood. I can now run up and
down the falls with the best of the hands on the
station. The men on the station know the pains
I suffered and the expense I was put to in my
endeavors to find relief from torture.”

“You certainly look well," remarked the re-
porter from the Walcha Witness, who was
present.
“ Yes, thanks to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are
sold only in boxes bearing the firm’s trade-mark
and wrapper (printed in red ink). Experiencing
any difficulty in obtaining the genuine Dr. Wil-
liams’, send direct to the Dr. Williams Medicine
Company, Sydney, who will forward (post paid,
on receipt of stamps or post order), one box for
2s. 9d., or half-a-dozen for 15s. 3d.
As a summer medicine Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
far surpass all other remedies. Their action on
the blood and nerves is prompt, and the effect is
wonderful. Lassitude gives way to a feeling of
renewed energy, and the lurking seeds of disease,
resulting from the indoor confinement of the
summer months, are speedily expelled from the
system.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are
not a patent medicine, but are a thoroughly scien-
tific preparation, the result of years of careful
study on the part of an eminent Edinburgh Uni-
versity physician, and they were successfully used
by him in his every-day practice for years before
being offered for general sale. They positively
cure Rheumatism, Sciatica, Lumbago, Neuralgia,
and Influenza’s after-effects, and are a specific for
all diseases of women, such as anaemia, poor and
watery blood, female irregularities, nervous head-
aches, and hysteria.
Mothers and Their Maidens.
What can be more distressing than to see a girl

Instead of bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and

that bespeaks disease and an early death if proper

To Parents and Guardians.
Upon parents and guardians rests a great re-
sponsibility at the time their daughters are bud-
ding into womanhood. If your daughter is pale,
complains of weakness, is “tired out” upon the
slightest exertion ; if she is troubled with head-
ache, backache, pain in the side, if her temper is
fitful and her appetite poor, she is in a condition
of extreme peril, a fit subject for the development
for the most dreaded of all diseases —Consumption.

health’s roses to the cheeks ; bright eyes and light-

With a Veil Between.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ever since her pigtail had made way for the fluffy
knots of hair at the back of her head she had
given herself seriously, and for all time, to Litera-
ture, and maimed moro nibs than her plan of
economy bargained for.
For she was poor—wonderfully poor.
Her poverty was of a kind that increased with
her increased wealth. The more she earned, the
more she was obliged to give. There was a gaping
fissure always ready to swallow it up with an airy
reluctance that had absolutely nothing but air in
it. This gaping fissure was her father.
She kept herself and him with her weekly
columns of society news, and with the paragraphs
which she made for anyone who paid for them.
And sometimes she wrote verses for advertise-
ments, and now and again a story, and between
them all she managed to keep up their lives.
In her twenty-third year she met a man,
attracted him until he loved her, then loved him
and became engaged to him.
He was not an ignorant man, and he had learnt
physical geography in his school days, but he be-
lieved now that the sun and the moon and the
stars all rose and set in the grey of her eyes ; that
all the color of the flowers was in her cheeks ; that
all the warmth and graciousness and beauty of the
universe had centred in her soul. His love for
her was blind as only a man’s love can be.
There was only one superlative which he denied
her : she was not the greatest poet that ever lived.
Possibly, being a man, he loved her all the
better for that. But she would never have be-
lieved it. She adored her work, and could not
realise that anyone could think much of her, and
little of it.
One day she came to him with something she
had just written. It was a poem, and she had
called it “An Interlude.” Even before he had
read it he was saying to himself that the name
was trite—
Work and skirmish, battle for bread,
Strife for freedom of heart and thought.
Day after day, till we lie down dead,
And Death the Lesson of Life has taught.
Every day with the sun-gleams early
Rise we fresh for the coming day.
Every gloaming the night winds whirling
Joy from our jaded souls away.
Day after day the joys grow lesser,
Day after day the weariness deepens,
Till our toil-stained hands have lost their pressure
On all that they loved in the Golden Past.
And aye and anon the red lights flicker
From some far Westland we may not pierce :
And then a spark of the old joys quicken,
And life is not so weary a space.
But the space of light is soon dimmed over,
And shadowy darkness falls down like a feather, '
And the moment’s gleam is again eclipsed
In a gloom that heightens the wintry weather.
Only gleam of light, and only
Faint far sparks from an unknown clime ;
But the interlude was sweet, and living
Is sweeter now for that little time.
He had a sphinx-like command of countenance,
but he wished she would not watch while he read.
When he had finished it he looked up and met her
eyes. They were fuff of questioning.
“ It is no good,” she said—that was her usual
preface—“ I know it is no good, but ” ——
Her pause meant “ What do you think of it ?
You like it, don’t you ? ”
He was very diplomatic.
“ I don’t know that I understand it,” he said.
Her face brightened wonderfully.
“ Don’t you? ” she said.
She evidently received his remark as a very
flattering compliment.
“ But which verse do you like best ? ”
“ Which verse? Well, I think I like the —er —
first as well as any, dear.”
“ The first, do you ? I don’t know. Perhaps
it is best. I thought I liked that one ‘ And aye
and anon the red lights flicker from some far
westland we may not pierce.’ And the third, ‘ Tiff
our toil-stained hands have lost their pressure on
all they loved in the Golden Past.”
“ Well, but Little Girl, where is your rhyme for
Past ? Not deepens, is it ? ”
“Oh, no, there is only one rhyme in that verse,
lesser and pressure.”
“ But the first verses have two rhymes.”
“ Oh, yes, I know, but Why, that doesn’t
matter, does it ? ” She looked a little hurt.
“ Well, but you are not going to rhyme living
and only, and pierce and space, and eclipsed and
over, and quicker and flicker, are you ? You
musn’t mind me saying so. We agreed, you
know, that anything but truth in literary matters
was detestable.”
“Yes, yes, I know. And don’t you like the
verses ? ”
They were interrupted. The father had
shambled into the room.
“ Where’s dinner ?” he said loudly. “ Where’s
dinner ? Where’s the damned dinner ?”
The man saw at a glance what was wrong, and
pity for the little girl who wrote such extra-
ordinary verses quite overcame all his critical
capabilities. He saw how the lines in her fore-
head deepened, and how a little of the color went
out of her cheeks, and he vowed fiercely to him-
self that no word of his should ever help to bring
another cloud to the poor little clouded brow.
“ I love you,” he whispered, as he held her
hands a minute in the passage; “if you would
only marry me, and let me take you away from it
all.”
“There is such a lot to do,” she said vaguely.
She was thinking ot her work. She had built
golden dreams about the future of her work.
“ And then, too, there is my father.”
But when he had gone, and her father lay
sleeping the heavy sleep of intoxication on the
sofa, she sat by the fire, and other reasons came
into her head.
She began to think of what he had said about
her verses. It seemed to her that he had looked
no further than the rhymes, and those were to her
of very secondary importance. Possibly they
were a little disorganised, but what did that
matter ? It was the spirit of the thing which she
had wanted him to feel with her, and it seemed
that he had been quite blind to it.
And, then, how quickly he had read them!
She could hardly believe that he had read right
through every verse in that short time. She had
noticed this brevity of his in reading her writing
before.
There was a photograph of him on the mantel-
piece, and she looked up at it suddenly. His
face was a quiet one, and well cut, with closely-
cropped hair, and deep set eyes. She looked hard
at it, and a little dissatisfied look crept over her
face.
“I wonder,” she said . . . “I wonder.”
Just above it hung a likeness cut from a maga-
zine of a famous modern novelist and verse-writer.
His eyes were prominent, and his head bulgy
with the length and thickness of his hair.
Possibly she mistook the prominence of his eyes
for deep-souled intelligence, and the length of his
hair for breadth of brow, for she turned again to
the face of her lover, and the dissatisfied look
deepened.
“I wonder does he care for books at all,” she
said. “ I wonder what he reads —I must ask
him.”
The next evening when he came she began her
catechism. “Have you read ‘The Yellow
Aster ? ’ ” she asked.
“ No,” said the man. He smiled.
“ Oh ! haven’t you ? Why everybody read it.”
“Well, but that is just the reason why I did
not. The books that everybody reads as they
come damp from the printer’s are not the books
for me.”
“You are like ‘The Silver Domino.’ It says
that ‘ Never did a name go up like a rocket but it
did not come plump down like a stick.’ ”
“ Did * The Silver Domino ’ say that ? Then it
used very bad grammar.”
He was tired of talking of books. He wanted to
talk of her and of himself. They had only been
engaged three months.
“ Why, it is one of the cleverest books of the
day,” she said, indignantly.
“ That is bad grammar, all the same,” he said.
“But have you read it?”
“ No, I have not read it.”
“ Oh, haven’t you ? Why— ”
She was going to say that everybody had read
it, but remembered what he had just said anent
that qualification.
“At any rate, it is a wonderfully clever book.
Do you know, I wish you would read it. How can
you know what it is like if you have not read it ? ”
“ Well, if you want me to, I will read it.”
“Oh, but I don’t like to think that you only
read books because I want you to.”
“ You need not think that, Little Girl.”
“ Do you read many books then ? ”
“ I read all those I care for.”
“ Have you read ‘ A Superfluous Woman ’ ?”
“No, I have notread that.”
“It is by Ella Dixon.”
“Is it?”
“ Well, have you read ‘ Ships that Pass in the
Night,’ or ‘The Wages of Sin,’ or ‘The Master’? ”
“ No, I am afraid I have not read any of those.
But I will. I will read them all, every one of
them, if it will give you the least little bit of
pleasure.”
The result of this catechism seemed decidedly
unsatisfactory to her.
“ He has read nothing,” she said to herself in a
dismayed tone. “ Absolutely nothing ! ”
She was making a mistake common to the age,
the mistake of measuring a man’s intellect by his
familiarity with modern fiction.
About this time he was very busy with some
work which he wished to turn to account for her
sake, and perhaps he saw less of her than usual.
At any rate it was some time before he became
aware of the change that was creeping over her.
A petulant despondency had taken the place of
her former brightness and happy-mindedness.
“ What are you always thinking of?” he said.
He was smoothing out the wrinkles on her fore-
head,
“ Oh, I don’t know,” she said.
She jerked her head away a little. Then she
was repentant, and laid her head against his arm
a minute. Then grew gloomy again and moved
away from him.
She was telling herself that he did not satisfy
her. He did not understand her. She could not
bring her innermost thoughts to him. He did not
care for poetry. He had read nothing. Ha
picked her rhymes to pieces, and gave no thought
to her thoughts. And she was telling herself that
perhaps, 'perhaps she had made a mistake. It was
a terrible thing for a woman to marry a man who
was intellectually her inferior, who had no tastes
in common with her, and scoffed at all that other
people admired in literature.
And the lines on her forehead deepened. She
was making up her mind.
It was the man himself who helped her most
effectually to do so. He brought her a book to
read one day—anew, inviting-looking look, with
the pages stiff uncut. It was called “In the
Stress of Life,” and was composed of some half-
dozen papers on different subjects.
“ I want you to read it,” he said.
She saw by the pages that he had not read it
himself and she was sorry for him, with a tinge of
contempt in her sorrow.
* • * *
A letter came to him next day. It was from
her, the Little Girl. “ I want you,” she said.
“ Come and see me to-night.”
She was alone in the little shabby sitting-room
when he came, sitting by the fire, and in her hand
was the book he had given her. She rose when he
came in, but did not go to meet him.
“I want to speak to you,” she said. “To—to
tell you—oh, can’t you understand I cannot
bind myself down to a life with you. I want you
to set me free. You are always good to me. You
are too good, too kind, too patient with me, but—
but”
She paused: He was white, but very. calm.
“ But what ?”
“But you are not large-souled enough. Oh, I
want a mind that is high above mine; a grand,
strong, clear mind, with sentiment as well as in-
sight, and a love for good books. I have felt it
for a long time. I—l bore you. You think me a
dreamer. You get impatient with me sometimes
—you never show it, but you must, and I cannot
talk to you about the things I care for most —books
and poetry. You do not read, do not care about
poetry. I have felt it all for a long time, but last
night I knew, all the scales fell away. It was
that book you lent me. It is wonderful, beauti-
ful. And I felt that you are too small, too earth-
centred. I want a big-souled man like the map
who wrote that book. He understands everything.
He would feel with me. I could marry that man.
But you, you, I cannot marry you.”
“ Little Girl,” he said, “ I wrote it.”
“ What?”
“Yes, it was I.”
“ What are you paying ? ”
“It was I who wrote it.”
“ You?”
“Yes.”
“ But you can’t write.”
He was silent. If he smiled his face was grave-
seeming.
“ But you, you never think ! You wrote it!”
“ Yes.”
“ But you never read ? ”
“Sometimes.”
“Oh, you didn’t, didn’t.”
“ I do think,.and I do read,” he said, “but I
have not the gift of turning myself inside-out at a
moment’s notice.”
Suddenly she turned and flung herself along
the sofa, and dropped her head in the cushions,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They’ve stitched him up in his canvas shirt
As stiff as a frozen board ;
They sewed pig-lead at his feet an’ ’ead,
And they sloshed him overboard.
The “ Old Man ” hadn’t a conscience,
Exceptin’ his wheel and his chart,
He pulled on sight, and his aim was right,
For he shot him through the heart.
His girl she waits in Grosvcnor-street,
That's hard by Sydney Quay,
His girl she ivaits in Grosvenor-street,
This two long years waits she ;
And 'er heart may weep, but he's sleeping deep
In the North Atlantic Sea.
He shipped with a Nova Scotia man
Last time that he ever signed ;
His cash was spent and ’er sails were bent,
And he was drunk and blind—
A man must take what he can get,
There’s plenty of men to spare,
With Danes and Swedes and the Dago breeds,
And ships go everywhere.
He laid his hand to a marlin’-spike,
Oh, he was a man to know !
And the deck ran red where he fell and bled,
But he shouldn’t ’ave acted so.
His blood was up and the threat came free,
But the high seas ’ave their ways,
And that was the end of a lover and friend,
And these are the better days.
’Tis round and round, as the world goes round
With a civil tongue in your ’ead,
’Tis do as you’re told though you’re starved and
cold,
And bitterly driven an’ led,
’Tis to and fro as you sign and go
Till Death he crosses your hawse,
You're stinted and worn, you’re tattered and torn,
But the owners make the laws !
A girl she lives in Grosvenor-street —
O, Lord l that I hadn't to go—
A girl she lives in Grosvenor-street,
And ’twiU break 'er 'eart to know
How he fell and bled, arid I wish I was dead,
But he shouldn’t ’ave acted so.

LAND OF THE CROCODILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
In the days when the old Union Club was
yet alive in Brisbane, and Jimmy Tyson was one
of the members, Tom Pickett was providore. A
big brown parcel, securely fastened, and with dabs
of sealing-wax here and there, arrived addressed
to Tyson. It came from America—from Chicago.
Tom put it under Tyson’s bed, >nd left it for
three weeks until Tyson returned'. Then he
brought out the parcel and placed it gently on
the table. Tyson told him to open it. Now the
nine was about *a month after the Phoenix Park
tragedy, and imaginative people were filled with
excited visions of slaughtered kings and mangled
millionaires and red-haired anarchists flying
through the air like devils and scattering death-
dealing bombs among the tyrants of mankind.
Therefore Tom Pickett calmly replied that he was
not prepared just then to accept the risk of
opening that package. Then Tyson observed
that he was not feeling very well that morn-
ing, and was also in an unusual hurry to go and
attend a meeting which he had nearly forgotten ;
and consequently Tom might just as well put the
package away, until some future occasion ! He
warned Tom, however, not to put it back under
the bed ! So the mysterious object was placed in
the store-room, and remained there for two years !
The day before Pickett left the Union Club, he
.hauled out the long-forgotten relic and opened it.
At this time he had been reconciled to any form
of death by an amateur-tenor squatter, who sang
“ Home, Sweet Home ” and “ Molly Riley ” every
morning and evening, and by a Maranoa poet who
daily recited a nine-foolscap blank verse poem on
a dead stockhorse. The infernal machine from
the Chicago anarchist proved to be a 141 b. tin of
beef preserved by a new process, and sent as a
sample to Tyson and the Queensland squatters !

This happened at an entertainment in aid
of the Congregational church. For grotesque
absurdity it probably stands without a parallel.
A Caledonian member of the congregation was
down for a recitation. Mac had a small dog that
insisted on following him into all sort of places,
frequently in defiance of stern requests to remain
at home. On the night in question the dog was
tied up but managed to get off chain, and rambled
joyously wagging his tail on to the platform, just
as Mac was in the second verse of “ Lord Ullin’s
Daughter.” With wild eyes and extended arm he
thundered forth,
Oh wha be ye wad cross Loch Gyle
This dark and stor-r-r-my watter?
Oh I’m the chief of Ulva’s Isle,
And this —
Here Mac caught sight of the dog at his feet, and
with one tremendous kick he lifted the unhappy
animal and shot it half-way across the audience,
concluding with a ferocious,
—Lord Ullin’s datter.
as if the dog personified that long-lost female!
The poor beast struck a fat lady in the eye. The
howls of the dog, the yell of the fat lady, and the
ungodly and irreverent shriek of frenzied laughter
from the whole congregation made up a chorus
probably never heard in any earthly church since
the Arian controversy of the 14th century.

The wife of a well-known Queensland
M.L.A. is a very pompous person who puts on
more airs than Cleopatra, and with considerably
less reason. She lately acquired a sharp-tongued
Italian lady named Bridget, who occupied the
position of cook. The mistress entered the kitchen
and interfered in the culinary business. Bridget
brandished the frying-pan with a Donegal war-'
whoop and yelled, “ By hivins, if yez doan’t git
out o this in foive seconds Oi’ll bang ye over the
head wid this froyan-pan! ” Mrs. M.L.A., in a fit
of attempted dignity, exclaimed, “ Bridget! do
you,know that I’m a lady ? ” “ You moight have

At Bundaberg I met an old German colonist
who was present in the Court House at East
Maitland in February, 1851, when Major Cram-
mer, the P.M., presented a brass plate and an
address to “ Jackey Jackey,” the aboriginal of
Kennedy’s Cape York expedition of 1848. Had
that black nob been with Kennedy, the whole
party would have vanished without leaving a trace
behind them And this reminds me that Jackey’s
native name was “ Galmarra ” (a composer of
songs), that he came from the Patrick’s Plains
tribe on the Hunter River, and finally killed him-
self with rum at Newcastle. Also that the Queens
land Govt. Botanist, Mr. Bailey, has named a
Russell River (N.Q.) grass Paspalum Galmarra, in
memory of that heroic savage, who was far more
entitled to a monument than Burke. Jackey
saved Kennedy’s papers and the lives of the two
men (Carron and Goddard) who survived out of 12,
while Burke’s folly caused the death of seven men
and did no good to anybody. ,

Up in Queensland a white man had for
some time as housekeeper a young gin of 19 years,
a daughter of the gods, divinely black. This
tame savage maiden had come to regard him as
her personal property. But the man lost his heart
to a white woman and decided to marry her.
The gin sharpened a nulla and waited. She is a
fiery daughter of a fiery mother, that mother being
now one of the last two of the old Moreton Island
tribe—an exceptionally powerful woman. There
was an entertainment at the local school-house.
The faithless youth was there with his white
bride. The deserted gin was there also—with a
nulla, and the blood of many generations of savage
women was fizzing in her veins. Suddenly there
were wild cries and sounds like a strong cricketer
banging a flour-bag with a bat. The clergyman
working the lantern rushed outside to ascertain the
cause, _ and got. a whack on the head that
sent him racing inside with his hands on his ears.
The white bride rushed to her young man’s
assistance, and was promptly caught in a black
whirlwind that rolled her over several times and
left her in a draggled heap. Then the gin belted
the young man with vehemence, and expeditiously
laid out several injudicious persons who interfered
on his behalf, and finally kicked and bit with
great impartiality at two old warriors who grabbed
her in the ancient style. The young man foolishly
summoned her to the police - court, where a
chivalrous Bench sympathised with the wrecked
affections of the gin and acquitted her without a
stain. But had “ Garaunpin’s” mother, “Bulla,”
stepped into the battle arena that night with a
yam-stick there would have been a record tragedy,

Robert Maekie, of Fairymeadow Station,
had an old Irishman, who owned a watch that he
claimed as an heirloom from one of his ancestors,
who took it off a Cromwellian officer he had
killed at the sanguinary battle of Ballynamuck.
Mick’s unquestioning faith in the infallibility of
that,ancient timepiece was, if possible, stronger
than his belief in the Pope himself. Maekie met
„.nru k i n ? ckin 8' off one evening earlier than usual.
What is your time, Mick?” Mick took out
his watch, looked critically and reproachfully at
the setting sun, and expressed a firm belief that
bhure the sun’s goin’ down a bit late to-night,

In the early sixties, the late Col. Drury,
of Q.N. Bank fame, was Brisbane manager of the
Bank of Australasia. The chief cause of that
bank dispensing with his services was an un-
authorised Overdraft of =860,000 he gave to certain
scions of nobility, who ran a Northern station on
r A UD x> a^?'C^ ami>agne Principles. Then Drury and
A. B. Buchanan started the Queensland National
Bank m opposition to the Australasia, and
Drury s own overdraft in that bank when he died
was *60,000 !

Parson Sydney Smith had a very wasting
Someone asked how much flesh he had
iost. About an average curate.”
Item from North Melbourne police-court :
Taking a comprehensive survey of the audience in
court, Dr. Lloyd apparently fixed his eye on a baldheaded
man, who is said to be a regular habiting of the court.
Addressing the audience generally, but with a glance
fixed on the baldheaded man, Dr. Lloyd spoke.
My fellow colleagues have asked me to make a few re-
marks. It is regrettable and melancholy for me to see
you gentlemen assemble here every court day with such
painful punctuality. Ido not think, however; that the
court is a proper place to idle away a long summer’s day.
Instead of wasting your time, gentlemen, listening to
nonsensical cases, you should be eagerly searching 1 for
employment. Yop should go into the highways and by-
ways. Attending this court only engenders bad habits,
laziness, and loafing. You, gentlemen, are a waste of raw
material. (The audience moved uneasily.)
The Baldheaded Man : We can’t get work, or else we
wouldn’t be here.
Dr. Lloyd : What does that man say ?
. Senior-constable O’Shea : He says he wouldn’t be here
if he could get work.
The Baldheaded Man : If you will only tell us where we
can get “ graft,” we will go and look for it. (Chorus of
Hear, hears.)
Dr. Lloyd : What does that man say ?
The Baldheaded Man : We can’t get work.
Dr. Lloyd : Put that man out.
The Baldheaded Man : We can’t get
Dr. Lloyd : Senior-constable, put that man out.
The baldheaded man, in a state of collapse, was then
led out into the street.
Which is all so very like the typical beak. The
c °urt lB public property and is open to the public,
and the bald-headed man stepped in to rest and
get out of the glare, and to avoid the flies that
rinked on his bare skull. He didn’t speak to the
Bench ; the Bench started talking to him without
an introduction. The bald-headed man kindly
overlooked that fact, and, like a gentleman, he re-
sponded when he was spoken to, and almost before
he got his mouth fairly open to make an affable
observation to the Bench he was assailed and
thrown out. And yet that Bench presumably
calls itself a gentleman.
