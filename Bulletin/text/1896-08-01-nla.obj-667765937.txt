LITERARY NOTES .
It is disappointing that Ethel Turner’s new
book of short stories should be disappoint-
ing ; yet it is. One turns back to “ Seven
Little Australians ” to see if the praised
charm still holds ; and it does. Then
why. . . ? Certainly “The Little Duchess ”
and another story or so first appeared in The
Bulletin, and The Bulletin was adorned
by their appearance. Then why . . ?
Perhaps it is on account of the massing :
you must take Little Duchesses in little
doseses : too many sweets cloy. Or perhaps
it is on account of the immaturity : were
not many of these tales composed before
the child-romances ? Or perhaps and
in this there really may be something—
it is because Ethel Turner paints best the
children whom she has known and studied,
not the grown-ups who are nearly all what
her fancy paints them—and nothing more.
And that’s what the public likes, generally
speaking. It’s a nice point to consider
whether they are better or worse off, on the
whole. Does the man of culture who smiles
now and again at Pinero enjoy life as much
as the man of no-culture roars in
ecstasy through a tawdry “variety enter-
tainment”? Were it not wiser to remain
intellectual children, with minds sensitive to
the least air of pleasure-giving excitement,
than to narrow in knowledge the circle of the
emotions, and find all things barren or mono-
tonous. Remember the delirium of Mayne
Reid, the first meeting with W. S. Hay
ward ! Thackeray and Meredith are better,
we know; but are they as good ? Is the
decrease in quantity of pleasant sensations
which comes with age and knowledge com-
pensated by increase in quality ? It’s a nice
point to consider.
* * * *
Only a little aid comes with subtle rele-
vancy from Matthew Arnold :
When I shall be divorced, some ten years hence,
From this poor present self which I am now ;
When youth has done its tedious vain expense
Of passions that for ever ebb and flow ;
Shall I not joy youth’s heats are left behind,
And breathe more happy in an even clime ?
Ah, no, for then I shall begin to find
A thousand virtues in this hated time 1
Then I shall wish its agitations back,
And all its thwarting currents of desire ;
Then I shall praise the heat which then I lack,
And call this hurrying fever, generous fire ;
And sigh that only one thing has been lent
To youth and age in common—disoontent.
• * * *
Yet—resuming—if the public wants emo-
tional cagmag, it might as well have its
cagmag neatly sauced and served. Mr.
Hennessey talks good English, anyway ;
he doesn’t outrage probabilities more than
he must; and he maintains an unusual level
of interest. And, as he is a very industrious
writer, his books are “catching on,” and
verily he hath his reward.
* * * *
In cash, of course, which is far more filling
than critics’ kudos. Becke and Jeffery know
this, who strike the public iron while it’s hot
with ‘ ‘ The Mystery of the Laughlin Islands ”
—a dull booklet which one is sorry to see
Australian writers’ names to. The fourth
and final part of it might have made a short
story—it is all the yam there is : the pre-
liminary padding merely supplies a back-
ground to semi-maudlin characters who damn
each other unconvincingly. The mystery is
a convicts’ escape from Port Jackson, and a
subsequent half-caste population on a South
Sea island—which doesn’t seem so very un-
natural after all.
* * * m
As a fact Becke and Jeffery—the latter’s
name, by the way, is still suppressed in
Publisher Unwin’s circulars—are going
quite the wrong way to work. A little
statement has been blown about to the
effect that “A First Fleet Family” was
written in twenty-eight days, “ only twenty-
eight days ” —as if it were a boast. A boast!
It is akin to that of the local literary lady
who foregathered at a theatre with a careful
and capable dramatic critic, and was as-
tonished when the latter excused himself
towards the close of the performance with—
“ I must go now ; I have a good half-column
to write ; I don’t suppose I’ll get away before
two or three in the morning.” “ What ! ”
said the lady, bristling notes of ex-
clamation, “ why ! I write a column an
hour ! ” She did ; and such a magnificent
column it was. For skipping.
* * • •
There is no getting away from the truism :
easy writing is damned hard reading. The book
written in twenty-eight days is forgotten in
twenty-eight days : the book that lives is the
book that costs a life and takes a life-time.
We want an Australian author to spend, like
Flaubert, years in meditation before spending
years in execution ; the local writer, so far,
is too hasty, too scrappy ; he will not take a
large canvas and ample time—or a small
canvas and ample time —ans create a master-
piece. One seems to see here and there the
minds to do memorable things ; but where
are the zeal, the persistence, the capacity to
“ toil terribly ”to a far-off goal ? Is there
in our febrile national temperament, with its
quick alternations of exaltation and depres-
sion, a something antagonistic to sustained
efibru on any line ? Is it our nature always
to flare fiercely for a moment, never to cast
a steady radiance over an eternity of time ?
* * * *
[And here, half-way up the hill of argu-
ment, a pause is made for the tired reader
to glance at the scenery in a verse or two
from Arthur Symons’s recently-published
“ London Nights” :
AT SEVENTEEN.
You were a child, and liked me yesterday.
To-day you are a woman, and perhaps
Those softer eyes betoken the sweet lapse
Of liking into loving—who shall say?
Only I know that there can be for us
No liking more, nor any kisses now,
But they shall wake sweet shame upon your
brow
Sweetly, or in a rose calamitous.
Trembling upon the verge of some new dawn
Yon stand, as if awakened out of sleep,
And it is I who cried to you “ Arise ! ”
I who would fain call back the child that’s gone,
And what you lost for me would have you keep,
Fearing to meet the woman of your eyes.
A PRAYER TO SAINT ANTHONY OF
PADUA.
Saint Anthony of Padua, whom I bear
In effigy about me, hear my prayer:
Kind saint who findest what is lost, I pray,
Bring back her heart: I lost it yesterday.
SLEEP.
As if tired out with kisses,
Content to be at rest,
Here, on my breast,
Her mouth, that aohed with kisses,
Drooped to my shoulder, then she sighed
A little, smiled,
Then, like a happy ohild,
She fell asleep upon my breast.
Love comes and goes, and this is
(Love, that I once caressed 1)
Love, like the rest,
And goes the way of kisses.
Yet one hour lives, of all those hours that died,
When, like a child,
She turned to me, just smiled,
And fell asleep upon my breast.
Rested ? Allons 1]
• • * •
These be high and solemn questions.
Possibly things will better as the wealthy,
cultured, leisured class increases. (Yet
Buckle’s showing that the progress of know-
ledge depends on the increase of wealth—
for the race—is strangely confuted by in-
dividual examples. Indeed, it is true only
to the point of a specialisation of industry
which need not imply wealth-accumulation
in the ordinary sense of the words).
Hero is a down-at-heel, out-at-elbows author
(neither of these phrases apply locally, by
the way: our facilis-descensus frequently
begins with the hat, or without the shirt—
and as to the ladies ?) who is seized with a
great epic idea—a stage for goddesses and
giants to strive upon. What does he do with
it ?—sit down for five years and make it im-
mortal? No fear; he sits down for five
hours —two, more likely—and turns it into a
short story which may be a minute’s marvel
ere it is swept away and forgotten. But he
collects—poor fellow ! —his guinea.
* * m *
If he would only sit down for a week, it
would be something ; but he cannot afford
even to do that. Yet there are in Australia
three or five fortunate gentlemen who are
able to spend £lOOO a year in buying books
which they never read and rarely permit
others to read. If The Bulletin were as
well off, its thousands and its libraries should
be devoted as that noble bookman Stenhouse
(the so-good friend to Kendall, and Deniehy,
and many a bright spirit else) fifty years ago
devoted his— to encouraging struggling young
writers to shun the snares of superficiality
and give to their generation and their country
the best that was in them. When one can-
not be Horace, how fine to be Augustus !
* * * *
Thus could the rich man in his life-time
do something to kill that pest of the age —
the plague of little books, dull books, weak
books, books more ephemeral than the
ephemeris, yet each doing its possible to
tempt and trap the unwary reader to his
mental undoing. Even all-quarantining
Australia does not quarantine these. One
pardons, of course, a little book to a be-
ginner, especially when it is good; but good
is not enough. We want better, and best,
and better than best. Several bright Aus-
tralian writers are now bringing home credit-
able firstfruits. But .... compare them with
the masterpieces of literature and note the
difference, the distance. Wherein lies it?
That you might toil for a year, through a
volume, to explain— so hard is it to get a clear
mental image of the felt idea, and to put that
image into words which do not utterly cari-
cature it. But to say that those Australians
are comparatively lacking in force of thought
and intensity of expression ; that they want
Passion and Conscience ; that their often
brilliant objective visualisations are pre-
sented as detached impressions, floating out-
side themselves, not brought home and fused
and ordered in subjective consciousness, and
then re-presented in their relation and pro-
portion to the great tin sof existence ,
this is to say something of what should be
said. We seem to want to think and
generalise more ; our logical processes stop
half-way ; we are all induction and no de-
duction ; our details bear no reference to
principles.
* * * *
Of course, one doesn’t desire to turn an
emu into an ostrich : one doesn’t expect that
little Joey will jump as far as old-man kan-
garoo. (This for the benefit of silly people
who won’t read with sympathy, and won’t
understand that any given word has ten
thousand given shades of meaning to a thou-
sand different people, and won’t be content
to take the spirit when the letter is impos-
sible.) If lovely Thais writes beside you,
you take the good the .gods provide you, and
are properly grateful. But, all the same,
The Bulletin will never rest contented till
Australian authors touch the highest stan-
dards set in literature ; and then it will set
the standards higher and preach discontent
anew.
Fancy is a very good thing, but it cannot
take the place of knowledge gained by close
observation. To be strong you must be
natural; to be natural you must study from
nature—paint your landscapes on the spot,
daisy by daisy, as Scott did ; watch
your characters for a week to get the
characteristic trait, as Maupassant did.
The characters in “ The Little Duchess
and Other Stories ” are like the shepherds
and shepherdesses in the china-shop, exqui-
sitely pretty, and dainty, and fragile, and
utterly unlike any shepherds and shep-
herdesses that ever existed. Consider the
story “ Wilkes of Waterloo,” which is beau-
tifully-finished in its way. The author takes
a lot of neat little emotions, and polishes
them with a neat little phrase - duster,
and puts them up on the mantelpiece
each exactly where it ought to be ; and you
feel as you gaze that they are most
elegant ornaments, arranged with charming
taste, and no mantelpiece could look prettier.
And .... after all, why cavil that china
ornaments aren’t alive ? Only because one
hopes for living things from Ethel Turner.
“ Wynnum,” by J. D. Hennessey, of Syd-
ney (Sampson Low), seems a book marvel-
lously well adapted to the public taste. The
public, the British public, the public that
buys—or a good three-fourths of it- -doesn’t
want artistic literature or intellectual litera-
ture. It wants a little romance, and a little
easy humor, and a little blood, and a villain,
and plenty of brave Alonzo and fair Imogene,
and a good bang-clatter of incident all the
way to the happy ending—typical melodrama,
in fact. Ask the experienced newspapers
which print serials. They have found out
that it’s no use feeding first-rate stuff to
fifth-rate intelligences. So London Times,
and Sydney Daily Telegraph, and all the
long stretch of journals between, stick to
unheard-of authors, or authors to bore you to
idiocy (if you read them), and find it pays.
Nothing so easy, say the wise men of the
evening papers, as writing above your public :
you can’t write below them. What does
Waldo’s clerk-friend tell him in “ African
Farm ” ? “ Ever read a book called the
‘ Black-eyed Creole ? ’ That’s the style for
me—there where the fellow takes the nigger-
girl by the arm, and the other fellow cuts
off. That’s what I like.”

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I lie ante,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medici' e for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S. W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearue’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed his New and Centrallv-situated
JElectrical & Consulting lioonis
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fee.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILITY,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.

THE PROMISE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They dreamed that life would last till love
Was dead, and knew love could not die.
And then the woman heard a Voice
That called her, called her, silently.
It had no substance in its sound,
It stirred no motion of a breath ;
She dulled her ears, it called aloud :
Her lover heard the voice of Death.
She had been his—mate, lover, wife;
Men called her wilful, but he knew
The marvel of her love for him.
In some shut sanctuary it grew.
Love had been lavish, and had laid
A holy softness in her eyes,
That washed their wilfulness away
And led him into Paradise.
He, only, knew the soul of her:
Slowly he learned it, day by day.
One soul alone can see our soul;
The world must stand a world away.
“ Oh, heart of me, and very life, _
Oh, saint and soul, what spirit sighed ! ”
He felt the clasping of her arms.
“Oh God ! It is not Death ! ” he cried.
“ Oh, soul of me and only saint,
Oh, forehead with the gold above ;
Oh, only mouth my mouth has known,
Oh eyes that taught my eyes to love !
“ Oh feet where I forever kneel,
My only potent place of prayer ;
Who could unlock your life from mine,
My woman with the shining hair !
She held him in her woman arms,
Her tender mouth began to moan.
“ They call me, but I will not go.”
(The Voice had loud and louder grown.)
She cried to Love to saviour her :
“ I served thee as a loyal slave.” _
But Love stood back with folded wings :
His eyes were sad. He could not save.
She held her lover in her arms,
And bent his face against her breast.
“ Some day, some night, I will return,
God shail not stay ” —Death stilled the rest.
His woman with the shining hair
And wilful mouth and wifely eyes,
Was hurried from his pleading hands,
Her hair made light in Paradise.
And now the autumn held the earth
Against her gentle, russet breast :
Red leaves with color carpeted
The dust their corpses scarcely pressed :
And nightly all the west was washed
With tones made of moist air and fire :
The poets in their gardens dreamed
Such loves as dying leaves inspire.
The russet of the dying life
Of nature paled to winter white,
And in the day she did not come;
She did not come through all the night.
He saw the shining head of her,
He heard her love-lips breathe his name.
“ I wait, I wait, I wait,” he moaned,
Lest she might hear. She never came.
Not when the wave of spring light broke,
And flowers found breath, and birds found
wing.
Straining through lambent twilights, he
Heard nothing but the stir of spring.
No glimmer of her gown or hair,
No touch of hand, no light of eyes,
Nor hroken breath, nor burning tear,
Came back from lonely Paradise.
Day after day he saw her die,
And heard again that wild, fond breath :
“ Some day, some night I will return ;
God shall not stay.” Then silent Death.
God shall not stay ! Then who had stayed
Her stealthy steps from spirit-land?
He saw her fighting some vast shape
That held her with a ruthless hand.
“ I know that she will come ! ” he said,
And watched and waited, year by year ;
Not Spring nor Summer heard of her,
Autumn and Winter did not hear.
The birds knew nothing of her now
They had forgot her merry voice ;
The flowers forgot her love of them,
Even the jonquils of her choice.
“ She said she would come back,” he said;
And often, in the midnight hush,
He stretched his arms out to the dark
And dreamed his hands had met her touch,
And even dreamed that she was there —
Her gown was still the snowy same—
And smelt the sweetness of her hair,
And.heard her breath. She never came.
After the waiting of a life,
A Voice—not hers—called silently;
His weary eyes were fired with flame,
He stammered in his ecstasy.
“ I knew that you would come,” he cried ;
“ But, oh, beloved, the long, long years ! . .
But when he knew whose call it was,
The flame was flooded out with tears.
Those who were nearest heard him moan
(The hardest could not help but weep):
“ Why did you promise, soul of mine,„
jL promise that you could not keep!

G. REID’S PIECE OF COLD IRON.
According to a return presented to N.S.W. Parliament by Premier Reid, certain Government stores which cost £10,132 in N.S.W., cost, in Victoria, £21,069. “That,” said
G. H. Reid, “is a piece of cold iron for Protectionists to chew.” The figures have since been proved to be erroneous in almost every particular, and the official who is alleged to have drawn
them up has been called on for an explanation.

Local Option All Round.
Within the last few years it is sufficiently
obvibus that the Cold Tea movement has
made material advances in Australasia. In
almost every province the alleged blessing of
Local Option seems to be in sight, or very
nearly so ; therefore Parson Boyce rages
in the press with a wilder, madder note
°f joy than heretofore, and Parson Isitt lifts
up his voice on high, and the Cold Tea party in
general is more or less jubilant. Meanwhile,
in all the provinces, the number of public-
houses is steadily becoming less in proportion
to population ; and the consumption of
liquor per head is apparently decreasing;
and 'either the number of aggravated drunks
is also decreasing, or else the police don’t
arrest them with the same vigor as of old.
Whether the teetotal party will help on this
process of reform by trying to forcibly ac-
celerate it, or will create a violent reaction,
no one can tell for certain until the great
experiment of Prohibition is tried. The
point to be considered in the meantime is
that Local Option is apparently coming all
over Australasia, save in those places where
it has already come ; that Local Option is the
natural forerunner of National Option, under
which system a whole State will vote as one
constituency for or against the abolition of
the drink-traffic within its borders ; and that
National Option, as likely as not, will lead,
some time or other, to straight-out Prohibi-
tion. Where Prohibition will lead to, no one
can tell yet—probably to the re-establishment
of the drink-trade as a State or municipal
monopoly ; but this is not the matter at
present under discussion.
• * * *
The question just now at issue is whether
the Option business, either local or national,
shall be carried to its legitimate conclusion,
or whether it shall go just as far as suits
the anti-liquor party’s convenience, and no
further. The Local Option idea is based on
the simple rule that the majority must
govern. This rule has been adopted, not
because the majority is a great success, but
because there is absolutely nothing else to
fall back upon. The majority may be, and
often is, an illogical ass, but so also quite as
often is the minority, and between the two
the only resource is to let the more numerous
ass carry the day. As civilisation advances
the number of matters which are referred to
the decision of the majority necessarily in-
creases. The commiwiity grows more parti-
cular about the things it sees and hears and
smells, and the necessity for compelling the
minority not to make itself a nuisance to the
taste of the majority keeps growing more
urgent. Therefore the time must needs
come when, if the majority objects to the
sight or smell of liquor, or to the manners
and language of the person who has been
drinking it, it shall claim the right to sup-
press liquor to the best of its ability. The
Bulletin doesn’t deny this right by any
means. What it objects to is that the tee-
total fanatic unduly limits the power of the
majority, and wants to have it narrowed
down so ridiculously that if the Cold Tea
crowd is uppermost it shall have all manner
of authority to dictate what the whisky crowd
shall drink, but a whisky majority shall have
no such power in return. In other words,
the Cold Tea crowd proposes a duel in which
it shall shoot at its antagonist until it hits
him, but he shall not shoot back.
* * * *
A very large section of the Cold Tea party
is rampantly Tory in all matters outside its
own little fad. It believes enthusiastically
in the Referendum as applied to alcohol, and
wholly disbelieves in it as applied to every-
thing else. If the Democratic party in the
Legislatures helps the Cold Tea faction to
get its own Referendum, a great many mem-
bers of that faction will thereafter do their
utmost to prevent the extension of that
Referendum to other purposes. Therefore,
Democratic politicians should sit down hard
and fast on all Local Option measures which
refer to drink only, and demand instead
Local—or, rather, National—Option in every-
thing, and make the method of referring
questions to the people the same in every
case. It is necessary, of course, to surround
the system with restrictions—a certain pro-
portion of the Assembly or a certain
number of electors must demand that a
question be referred before the expense of
taking a poll is justified, else the system
would be run into the ground by every casual
crank, and the polls would be unending, and
the expense incalculable. But if the anti-
liquor party can raise the requisition pre-
scribed by law, it should gets its national
vote, just as the State Bank party, or the
Freetraders, or Protectionists, or Land-
Nationalisers, or Single-taxers, or Socialists,
or bi-metallists, or any other party should
do in similar circumstances. It should be
under exactly the same conditions as to the
number of votes required to make the poll
valid and the majority necessary to alter the
existing state of things. In short, the
teetotal-party should have just the same
Referendum as every other party and no
more.
* * * *
The questions which the Local Optionists
desire to submit to a popular vote are
generally three in number : Shall the number
of licensed houses remain as it is, or be re-
duced, or shall licensed houses be altogether
abolished ? If they win, therefore, they
gain something ; if they don’t win they lose
nothing. Under a fair and logical system it
should be competent for the other party, if
it can raise the necessary requisition for a
poll on its side of the subject, to have a vote
taken on the equally pertinent question :
Shall the number of licensed houses be in-
creased, and, if so, to what extent ? The
Local Optionist demands the power to take a
popular vote as to whether the minority
shall be compelled not to drink whisky, and
it is equally just that the other party, if it
can comply with the terms of the Referen-
dum Act, should be able to take a vote as to
whether the minority shall be compelled
to drink whisky, or at least to pay
the State for the whisky which the
majority thinks, on the basis of its own
experience, it ought to drink. And along
with the popular vote for the abolition of
the whisky-seller there should be exactly
similar facilities for taking a vote as to the
abolition of the teetotal lecturer, in case a
majority of the people should desire to get
rid of him. The fact that there is very little
probability of any one ever obtaining a poll
on the latter question makes no difference
whatever in the equity of the situation.
Every question has two sides, and a scheme
which carefully provides that the people
may, if they like, vote aggressively in
favor of one side, but only defensively
in favor of the other, is wholly ridiculous.
If any Protectionist politician suggested a
popular vote as to whether the New’ South
Wales tariff shall remain as it is, or be
altered in the direction of Protection, but
proposed that there should be no vote at all
on the third possibility—a further advance
towards Freetrade ; or if a Freetrade poli-
tician suggested a popular vote as to whether
the tariff should remain as it is, or be
abolished altogether, but demanded that no
one should be allowed to vote for Protection
by the simple process of leaving it out of the
ballot-paper altogether—the people would
probably set him down as a person who was
too absurd for further consideration. Yet
this is exactly the sort of thing the Local
Optionists demand, arid their absurdity has
apparently not yet fully dawned upon any-
body.
* * * •
The last court of appeal in a democratic
community is the majority. It is not by
any means a perfect court of appeal, but it
is the only one possible. The extent to
which the majority may rightly interfere
with the personal liberty of the minority is
absolutely undefined, and the only power
which can define it is the majority itself. If
the majority says it has the right to decide
that the minority shall not drink alcohol,
then it has the right—the practical right,
anyway —for the last court of appeal has
said so, and the matter ends there until
the court changes its views. If the majority
says that it has the right to make the
minority drink alcohol, then it has that right
also, for the sufficient reason that no one save
the majority can prove, by any effectual pro-
cess, that it hasn’t. It has a right to Local
Option in men as well as in drinks ; the com-
munity which votes the expulsion of liquor
has an equally good title to vote—as was
done under the old Greek law of ostracism—
for the expulsion of an individual whose pre-
sence displeases it. Therefore it has a per-
fect right to hold a Local Option poll to
decide whether Parson Boyce shall or shall
not be sent over the border and warned not
to return under pain of death, on the ground
that he is ugly or foolish or unpicturesque,
or on no ground kt all save that it thinks it
can do without him. And it is no earthly
use for Parson Boyce, while demanding
Local Option in drink, to allege that such
doings as these would be an undue interfer-
ence with the liberty of the subject. The
only practical measure of what is undue in-
terference is the decision of the majority.
The majority— Boyce’s majority—has all due
authority to say that somebody else shall not
drink whisky, if there is enough of it to do
so. And any other majority has an equally
good right to enact that Boyce shall chew
tobacco. The only necessary proof of the
majority’s right in either case is that the
majority enacts that it has the right. There
is no right which the majority hasn’t got if
it enacts in legal form that it has got it.
* * * *
When Prohibition comes to pass, by virtue
of the majority, it will close up the public-
houses, breweries, distilleries, vineyards, and
all other properties belonging to the trade.
It is safe to assume that the owners of these
won’t be compensated, for two reasons.
First, the Prohibitionist majority will prob-
ably decide that they are -wicked people who
deserve no . consideration ; secondly, there
will have to be an enormous increase of
direct taxation to make up for the loss to the
Treasury through the extinction of the drink-
revenue, and another enormous increase for
compensation-purposes would be more than
the country could stand—in fact, the country,
in all probability, couldn’t compensate if it
wanted to. A third reason—that it would
be a cold, hard proceeding to deprive the
minority of its drink against its will, and
then tax it to pay for being deprived of its
drink—would not come into consideration,
for that would only affect the minority, and
the minority doesn’t count. Assuming, there-
fore, as the Cold Tea party alleges, and as
many other people allege, that a Cold Tea
majority has every right to destroy the pro-
perty of drink-sellers and drink-makers with-
out compensation, in pursuance of an object
which the majority alleges to be good, then
a Socialist majority lias an equally good right
to shut up private banks without compensa-
tion, if it wants to start a State Bank ; or to
shut up private insurance-offices in order to
start a State Insurance Department; or to
confiscate the private drink-trade, not in the
Cold Tea interest, but for the purpose of
starting a State Drink Department ; or to
confiscate the church lands, if it had a use
for them; or to confiscate Papson Boyce’s
own tabernacle, if it has a desire to build a
public-house on the site. There is no legal
reason why all these things shouldn’t be
done if the majority enacts that they should
be. There is also, from the point of view of
the majority, no moral reason; the thing that
is right, so far as the majority knows it, is
simply the thing which the majority thinks
is right, and if the majority thinks any or all
of these things are right, then they are right,
for all practical purposes, until it changes its
views. When it changes its views, then they
are not right.
* * * *
The moral of all this is that The Bulletin
believes the Cold Tea party should have its
Referendum so long as every other party has
also a Referendum on exactly the same con-
ditions, hut if the Cold Tea party is against
the Referendum in general then it should get
no more consideration than it gives. The Bul-
letin believes that the dispossessed publican,
brewer, and vigneron should have compensa-
tion for the destruction of their businesses by
law, provided that the manufacturer whose
trade is ruined by the establishment of Free-
trade, or the importer whose business is
smothered by a reversion to Protection, or
anybody eke whose industry is killed ’by
a vote of the majority, is compensated also.
And, if the drink-seller does not have com-
pensation, it doesn’t see why the bank, or
insurance co., or pawnbroker should have it
either, if the majority decides that the State
should take over these businesses. It
believes that the majority has sufficient right
to confiscate the brewery business just as it
has to confiscate any teetotaller’s house and
land to make way for a new railway ; and it
has just as good a claim to enact that the
minority shall not drink as it has to enact
that the minority (Boyce’s minority) shall
be intoxicated every Saturday night, if it
prefers to vote that way. In short, this

The Burns Myth.
A blasphemous person, himself no mean poet,
sends the following to The Bulletin under the
outrageous heading above printed :
It is true that even Carlyle, who professed
to care nothing for any poetry that was not
epic, turned on his full orchestra in praise of
Burns. But then Carlyle was also a Scotch-
man ; and blood, especially Scotch blood, is
thicker than water. Robert Burns was cer-
tainly a poet, but by no means a great poet.
The light that never was on sea or land ivas to
him at times visible, but the vision was never
long sustained. His was not
the amule pinion
That the Theban eagles bear,
Sailing with supreme dominion
Through the azure fields of air.
How, then, was his world-wide reputation
obtained ? In the first place, through his hav-
ing—at a particularly barren period in British
literature—dared to compose verses whilefollow-
ing the ploughtail. The Scottish reading public
of that day—a very small minority of the popu-
lation—-accustomed to the academic verses ol
their Beatties and Blairs, were paralysed
with astonishment when they heard an authentic
human voice singing lyrically in the fields ol
Ayr. It was to them as though the shovel-
headed mole had become vocal. And so they
regarded Burns as a sort of incarnated Scotch
miracle. They, in their learned ignorance,
looked upon him as an example of daemonic in-
spiration because he had (what they had not]
the eyes to see the beauty and the poetry ol
“common things.” As though a ploughman,
starting at the beginning of his furrow at dawn,
and having the sky above him and the air
around him all through the day, had not (if he
had the singing-gift) a better schooling in the
Poetic Academy of Nature than the cultured
gentlemen who wrote about the dawn by lamp-
light ! As a matter of fact, the odds were all
on the side of Burns. But none of his innu-
merable critics and laudators appear to have
had even a dim suspicion of this fact. Another
reason why Robert Burns is so idolised by his
compatriots : he was a humorist, and, as such,
a phenomenon in the kingdom north of the
Tweed. To alter the lines of Pope to suit the
occasion—
Humor in Scotland is so very rare
Scots wonder how the devil it got there.
And, therefore, it is not unnatural that they
should combine to worship the Bard of Ayr.
He supplied a national want —or, let me say, a
national deficiency. But supposing that the
songs of Burns were divested of the original
airs to which they were written—“Ye Banks
and Braes o’ Bonny Boon,” for example—would
they stir the hearts of men as they now do ?
Hardly. And, however the Pattersons and
Johnstones and Armstrongs and their ilks
may like to hear it, all Scottish poetry —
wherein is contained the vision and the faculty
divine—is either emphatically and absolutely
Celtic, or Celtic by suggestion. Nearly all the
old airs, to which Burns wrote words, were
Celtic. The Lowland Saxon could never have
composed them. It wasn’t in him to let his
soul go forth into the night as is the n ay of
the Celt. Take for another instance “Robin
Adair.” This is supposed to be a Lowland
Scottish song, and this is how it begins :
What made th’ Assembly shine ?
Robin Adair!
What made the ball so fine ?
Robin Adair!
And so forth, in the same Cockney strain. The
air to which these fifth-rate dance-saloon words
were written is Irish, and, in its own country,
is called “Aileen Aroon.” It is said to have
been improvised by an Irish harper of the 13th
century who was in love with the daughter of
the De Burgos —now called Burke. His horse
was standing in charge of one of his clansmen
outside the castle gate, and he gave the signal of
elopement to his sweetheart by playing upon
his harp and singing in Irish a song, the first
verse of which is feebly and faintly translated
as below :
A hundred thousand welcomes,
Aileen Aroon !
With welcomes more and more
And welcomes still in store
Till love and life be o’er,
Aileen Aroon !
The foregoing, though worlds away from the
true spirit of the original, is, at least, many
times better than the pinchbeck rhymes
associated with “ Robin Adair.” The author of
them was one Carroll O’Daley, and it was his
elopement with the heiress of the De Burgos
which gave to Scott the idea of his ballad,
Young Lochinvar.” If any Scotchman should
feel aggrieved by what has been said up to this
point, the writer is ready to apologise-to him in
the whisky of his country. Furthermore, to
show that he (the writer) has also a soft spot
tor Scotchmen in his heart, he will quote the
iollowing lines from a poem—which ninety-nine
out of one hundred Scotchmen have not seen—
written by an almost-forgotten American poet
named Fitzgreen Halleck concerning th©
Scottish idol :
There have been loftier themes than his,
And longer scrolls and louder lyres,
And lays lit up with poesy’s
Purer and holier fires ;
Yet read the names that know not death,
Few nobler ones than Burns’ are there,
And few have won a greener wreach
Than that which binds his hair.
And still, as on his funeral-day,
C °U earth-couch around
With the mute homage that we pay
To consecrated ground.
Su <* graves as his are pilgrim-shrines—
Shrines for no code or creed confined :
The Delphic vales, the Palestines,
The Meccas of the mind.
But what to us the sculptor’s art,
His funeral-column, wreaths, and urns ?
Wear we not, graven on our heart
The name of Robert Burns ?
Nevertheless, Burns is not a great poet per se
But he is a great Scotch poet. And as a Scotch
humorist he is unique and miraculous—a dis-
tinct and quaint interposition of Providenck.

inspired ploughman is to expose the fustian character of
his sentiments and t le ridiculous effrontery of his verse.
• Burns in a geneial way, was a puerile rhymester who
talked Scotch or English just as the metncal require-
ments moved him. Take an imitation, manufactured tor

of the Kennedy Family warblers of Scottish ditties.

of it

And heartsome gill.

E’en to this distant Southern land, _
And, more by token, there’s my hand
And heartv cheek.
But, how is it that you’re let a-going
With such good will.”

A Sabbath Suggestion.
Dear Bulletin,— If there is anything more
urgently wanted than another in Australia just
no w I think it is a solid Anti-Sabbatarian Asso-
ciation. Sunday, as it is kept at present, is a
day of mortification and gloom. lhis more
particularly in Victoria, where the dour Presby-
terian Puritans are both spiritual and temporal
tyrants, and take the best of care that if those
who disagree with them should (by some barely
conceivable kink in the iron chain of predes-
tination) escape having a bad time m the next
world they shall at least—in order to make up
for any mistaken leniency on the part of the
Almighty —have a hell of a time in this one.
Some few days ago Castlemaine Borough
Council, egged on by local clergymen, an-
nounced that for the future it would refuse
permission for the holding of Sunday concerts
in the Botanical Gardens. And the concerts
referred to were, be it remembered, sacred con-
certs. Perhaps this made them all the more
objectionable to the ministers. Nobody likes
to have his monopoly interfered with, lhe
Rev EA. Crawford— may his tribe increase .
-was the only Protestant clergyman who re-
fused to take part in the ignominious business.
Two or three days afterwards Hamilton
Borough Council was applied to by the Blind
Singers, who are now touring the pro-
vinces for a living, for the use of the local
Town Hall on the following Sunday night. Ihe
B.S. guaranteed that none but sacred selections
should be given, but a number of the council ors
rejected the application with pious horror, stat-
ing that the Sabbath should not be desecrated
while they could prevent it. Prom which it
will be seen that if the Lord liasn t sense or
spirit enough to look after His own Imsiness on
what is (entirely without His authority) called
His own Day, there are (in Victoria, at any
rate) plenty of black-muzzled saints to look
after it for Him. Meanwhile, anybody who
isn’t a black-muzzled saint must take the con-
sequences. If he is a citizen of Melbourne he
may spend his Sunday afternoons in any of the
following ways— viz. , by visiting the cemetery,
attending a pleasant Sunday afternoon-service,
lying in bed and sleeping the time through, or,
finally, by getting clandestinely drunk in a
Sunday-trading pothouse. Of these different
methods of murdering time, the pleasant Sun-
day afternoon method is the most dismal.
Some months ago, G. R. Sims, writing on this
very theme, said :
We are all living our lives lor the one and only time.
All the rest of eternity we shall pass somewhere else an
tirohablv amid vastly different surroundings. It is, ifyou
think of it, monstrously unjust that dunng °
snell —at the best, sixty or seventy .veais out of millions
of icons—we should have to submit to the rules and regu-
lations of a handful of narrow-minded, tyrannical bigots,
who object tfl anything that is not intimately connected
with sackcloth and ashes. If we don t ’
we don’t get a little fun and recreation out of our spare
time now, we shan’t have the chance later on. This is oui
chance to get the best out of life and the best out of the
world. If people would only recognise this fact they
would value and prize life and its privileges. and t
would be such a mighty uprising against the sour Killjoys
of Puritanism that they would be swiftly swept away
from the Council Boards of the City and the State, and no
body of bigots would ever again attempt, by absurd re-
striction or monstrous persecution, to reduce the free-boin
Briton to a condition which is half schoolboy and half
slave.
This is just the sort of uprising I am yearning
to see uprise, with bloocl in its eye, here in Aus-
tralia. The strength of our local bigots lies in
their unity and their fanaticism. They made
up t heir minds long ago that the rest of the
community should, in spite of itself, spend its
Sundays in their groanful fashion—or in tribu-
lation of another sort. And, by dogged persist-
ence they have carried their point and brought
the entire public under their dreary yoke. This
n ,i <rht have been thrown off over and over again
if the public could have been shaken out of its
besotted lethargy and made to see what an ass
and slave it was. There is only one way of
doing this, and that is fighting the bigots with
their own weapons, and opposing their Societies
for Keeping the Sabbath Miserable by an Anti-
Sabbatarian Association that will work strenu-
ously and bulldoggedly till it has compelled
the sour-eyed Killjoys to take their shackles off
the Sabbath so that it may once more become a
free and bright and reasonable Sunday.—Yours,
Creeve Roe.
The Medicoes in the Manger.
An Adelaide medico, it is said, has applied lhe
epithet “ cur” to the doctor who comes to take
the vacant hospital headship. This term of
opprobrium probably expresses the professional
view of the case from the narrowest trades-
union standpoint. The origin of the dispute
between Premier Kingston and the physicians
of Adelaide hospital now matters nothing.
The aggrieved doctors had a perfect right to
resign under the circumstances, or under any
circumstances; and they did resign. But now
they exceed their rights Certainly the
spectacle of a union of allegedly cultured pio-
fessional men out on strike has its humorous
side. Their human nature proves to be the
identical human nature met in a union of brick-
layers or shearers. '1 hey abuse the enemy ,
they bribe his customer-patients with free food
and lodging and attendance not to deal with
him ; they write to the trade newspapers
warning comrades that a strike is on, and there
must be no application for billets ; they
denounce as blacklegs the interlopers who per-
sist in coming to take their places, and resolve
to boycott them socially and professional y.
It wants little, apparently, that there should
be picketing, and “ stoushmg, and trouble
with the police, and a call-to-arms of
the local militia. But who is the enemy
of these enraged medicoes in the manger,
who will neither eat Adelaide hospital hay them-
selves nor suffer anyone else to eat it. the
enemy is not Premier Kingston— he suffers
nothing though the hospital should be per-
manently closed. The enemy is the people, the
sick and suffering people, who are to be denied
medical attendance because of a squabble amo g
their officials ! Apparently the Adelaide doc-
tors are quite prepared to abolish the hospital
altogether, and let the sick poor go die, rather
than allow others to take up the humane work
which they scornfully refuse ! fn other words
the medical guild not only refuses to attend the
hospital itself, but will actually not permit any
one else to do so. Which is a fine, large, brutal
attitude for the alleged healing profession to
assume. _
The Municipal Auditor.
Dear Bulletin,— Your remarks re muni-
cipal auditing are very good, lhe Victorian
municipal accounts are also audited by a
Government Auditor who specially qualities
himself for the position by examina-
tion, and receives his appointment from the
Governor in Council. Being, apparently,
backed un by the Government, this qualified
auditor has regarded himself as thoroughly in-
dependent of the men whose accounts he is in-
structed to examine and report upon. it is
proving otherwise. The Local Government Ac
under which the examinations are held and the
appointments made has no 01 J®
auditor to recover his fees. The Council, when
annoyed at the discoveries made by a too-
zealous auditor, simply passes a resolution that
the auditor’s claim is exorbitant and be no
paid. Sometimes a cautious councillor wil
move an amendment that the auditor be called
upon for an explanation. This is invariably
lost. The Council thereby defies the Act. The
Councillors then stigmatise the auditor as a
robber and his fees as legalised robbery, care-
fully omitting any mention of the reve-
lations which have been made. Council-
lors and officials are thicker than thieves
when the latter are incontinently put into
gaol for “retaining” money—the former then
feel they have a grievance against the audi-
tor 1 The next step for the Council to take in
support of its position is to throw dust in the
eyes of the ratepayers by getting inspired para-
graphs inserted in the local press totheeflectthat
the audit took too long—aud the auditors went
into things too far back, and so on ad nauseam.
The only remedy for the auditor is to enter
upon a highly risky and technical legal process
by asking the Supreme Court for a mandamus
to compel the municipality to pay the audit-
fees in accordance with the Act. Seemingly, a
Judge solus doesn’t like the mandamus applica-
and he refers it to the Full Court. Ihe
Judges do not always take things as they come,
so as to when those fees will be received by the
auditor it is a matter of conjecture, lliere are
some half-dozen or so Government auditors now
waiting the decision of the Full Court before
proceeding to take steps to recover their fees, and
it goes without saying the reports of these 'par-
ticular auditors, were all of a highly unpleasant
character. In some cases embezzlements by
officials have been pointed at, and m others the
financial vagaries of the councillors have been
laid bare. The undertaking of contracts by coun-
cillors (of course, illegal) when discovered gener-
ally stirs up the councillors to make nasty
remarks at public meetings upon the auditors,
both Govt, and local. The councillors would
like to say what books and documents should
be looked at and what questions should be
asked by the auditor. The Govt, of Victoria
might fairly answer these questions :
(1) Why was the power to recover fees omitted from the
L< (2) Why was the Minister of Public Works deprived of
his power to decide disputes between cre d it o r S and muni-
cipalities, such power being given him undei the Statute
prior to the consolidation of 1890? „
P (3) Will they remedy a glaring defect in this direction
when they have before them the abolition of the lo^al
aU (4) t Will they have sufficient courage to propose that all
auditors should be qualified by examination
(5) Will they take public opinion as the guide, and detj
the directors in the two Houses by makmg auditors o
companies’ accounts thoroughly independent of the influ
ence of directorates and proxies ?
I write very fully on this subject, because I am
suffering keenly—l have lost my money in the
past through inefficient auditing of the com-
panies where it was invested, and 1 have to
risk my money now to recover audit-fees from
the shire for what I know was efficient
auditing.—Government Municipal Auditor.
Australian Hospital Sweating.
Ed. Bulletin,— Concerning your remarks on
the sweating of nurses by Charity: W hat
about the sweating of medical men attached to
hospitals ’ Just think of the enormous number
of patients treated by the honorary medical
staffs of the hospital! These men are, like
nurses and other servants, subject to the rules
of the Hospital Boards; they perform a huge
amount of arduous professional work and do
not receive any payment whatsoever for these
services ! Sweating does not necessarily in-
volve long hours of work. To make any
servant give his or her services at an
unreasonably low price or gratuitously is
unquestionably sweating. And it does not
matter who is the master your capi-
talist,” the Government, or the Hospital
Board and Charity. Nor does it make any
difference that, as soon as a vacancy occurs on
the doctors’ or nurses’ staff of a hospital, there
are dozens of applications for every post. It is
nevertheless sweating. It might, of course, e
said that the difference between a decent
remuneration for the services and the actual
remuneration constitutes the donation to charity
on the part of the doctors and nurses. But this
is absolutely erroneous, for no doctor would, of
his own free will, spend the money-value of Ins
work as honorary medical officer to a hospital on
charity, because", measured by the ordinary rate
of fees, this money-value of his work would be
at least ten times his total income. It is, there-
fore, not because medical men are more charit-
able than the rest of human society, but simply
because they have allowed themselves to be
sweated that they give such an enormous
amount of workdo hospitals gratuitously, lo
a certain degree, therefore, medical men deserve
their undignified position. Still, the sweating
is unquestionably an injustice, an abuse of
power on the part of the Hospital Boards and
of the community. On the continent of Europe
this injustice has long been removed in a very
simple way. Take Germany : There does not
exist any honorary appointment to a hospital,
no honorary doctor, no honorary board. It has
long been recognised as the duty of the munici-
palities to provide for their sick (and poor).
After one has lived for a certain period in a
municipality this municipality is responsible
for his care and attendance in case of sickness
combined with poverty. The municipalities
therefore own the hospitals and levy from every
citizen a hospital rate just as any other
rate, and from this rate all expenses of the
hospitals medical salaries included are
defrayed. A hospital, therefore, is not an
institution depending upon voluntary contri-
butions of charitably-inclined people, but a
commercial undertaking of the same order asa
municipal gasworks —not conducted for the
purpose of producing revenue, but with a view
to be fully effective on the one part and on the
other to be as small a loss to the municipal
purse as possible. Thus sweating exists just
as much or as little in German hospitals as
in other municipal or Governmental workshops
and offices. And the result is a good one tor
all concerned. 1. The medical man receives
only fair pay for his work, performs Ins duties
cheerfully and with a high sense of duty and
dignitv. 2. The sick, consisting of none but
genuiiiely-poor people, enlist the sympathetic
interest of their medical attendants. S. All
people able to pay for medical attendance are
strictly excluded from the benefits which the
taxpayers wish to have conferred upon the poor
in their midst. Altogether, the system of pro-
fessional men giving their professional services
gratuitously to charity is a rotten one. G.E.
[Then why do they give ? From sheer inherent
altruism? The Bulletin smiles. “ G.L. s sympathetic
statement of the doctors’ case leaves out the cardinal
factor. What is “sweating”? In essence, services
rendered without quid pro quo. And the doctors have no
quid pro quo\ have they not? Then whence the enoi-
inous competition for unpaid hospital appointments bj
medical men in well-paid practice ? For love of humanity
and the greater glory of God ? The Bulletin smiles some
more Why, the quid pro quo is on the surface of the
argument: it is experience; experience which has a
solid cash value for extra-hospital practice. lo
the public hospitals gravitate all the most in-
teresting ” and complicated “ oases —cases which
don’t come to the average practitioner once m
a lifetime. The hospital surgeon makes his _ ex-
periments—gets his hand in; the hospital phj sician
strengthens his powers of diagnosis—fires his drugs in ,
in corpora vili. He cuts and carves, or shoots and hits or
misses, “ without prejudice.” Deaths go to the hospital
account; not to the operator’s. And all the while he is
accumulating most valuable knowledge—knowledge
worth guineas and guineas to him then or afterwards.
He is at least as much student as professor ; he learns as
much as he teaches; and the hospital actually supplies
him with this splendid practice, gives him this priceless
course of study, and throws in subjects, drugs, instru-
ments nurses, operating room, everything necessary to
his success—all absolutely without fee [—“gratuitously,
as “ G.L.” puts it. —Ed B.]
The Privy Council Will-o’-the-Wi&p.
Apart from the Imperialistic device foi tighten-
ing those silken bonds, &c., the chief reason
given for the proposed appointment of an Aus-
tralian Judge to a seat in the Privy Council for
the purpose of colonial appeals, is that in such
cases he would be useful as a sort of expert in
colonial law. Let us see how far his usefulness
in that capacity would extend. Seeing that lie
is needed only as an expert, his presence would
be superfluous in cases which have to be decided
according to the principles of common law only
(and many such go from the colonies to the
Privy Council), becauseour common law issimply
the common law of England, in which the Eng-
lish Judges are, or are supposed to be, more
skilled than ours. The same remark applies
to cases depending on colonial statutes which
are identical with English statutes. So that
we get the sphere of usefulness limited to cases
depending on the statute law of the colonies, so
far as it differs from the English statute law.
Again, as many colonial statutes aie peculiar to
one particular colony, and as there is, generally
speaking, a w'ide difference between the statute
laws of the various colonies, it follows that the
said sphere of usefulness must be further
limited to cases depending either upon statutes
in force in the colony from which the Judge
has been chosen or upon statutes of other
colonies which have a parallel in that colony.
For instance, a Judge from New South Wales
might be useful in a case from Queensland
which depended upon the Real Property Act
of that colony, because there is a somewhat
similar statute in force in New South \\ ales.
But in a case depending, for instance, on the
Dividend Duty Act of Queensland, which is
peculiar to that province (and there is such a
case actually pending now), a Judge from any
of the other provinces would be useless as an
expert, as he would have no more official
knowledge concerning that Act than the
present Judges of the Privy Council.
An analysis of the colonial appeals decided by
the Privy Council during 1895 shows that, if
Mr. Justice Winpeyek, whom it is proposed to
appoint, had been a Judge of the 1 tivy Council
during that year, the very outside limit of his
usefulness as an expert would have been con-
fined to six cases out of 29. The other 23 cases
depended either on purely local laws an
statutes outside of N.S. Wales or on the
common law, or on statutes identical with
statutes in force in England, in all of which, as
has been pointed out, the presence of an Aus-
tralian Judge as an expert is useless and supei
fluous. ;
Ed. Bulletin,— N.S. W. Labor-members would
suffer little financially were the motion to re-
duce their Parliamentary salaries by one-halt
carried. At present they are dogged by
needy followers who practically claim a share
of the spoil. No member who, before entering
Parliament, used to earn £2 or £3 per week can
satisfactorily explain to these followers why he
now needs the whole of <£6 per week. ence,
part he must or prepare himself to be tree ed
as a traitorous enemy. On the other hano, l
the allowance were but <£lso a year, camp-
followers would have no case, and the
member would possess as much as on the
average he is now able to retain. Further, tie
purity of his motives would be less doubted.
This is no small matter. That a man may
Drofit himself and his country at the
same time is quite possible. But the
producer of the twofold profit must stand the
ieers of passers-by. Tories who want to. kil
Labor-representatives could do so by raising
Parliamentary wages to ,£l5 a week. Labor-
representation without payment of members is
on a large scale impossible. Labor-representa-
tion on high salaries, unless the member can be
tied down under legal bond to give most of it
to his class, is equally impossible ; and if so
tied down he diverts the revenue into improper
channels, for, instead of payment of members,
his theory is payment of members and members
hangers-on. —O’B.
Editor Bulletin.— /?e late remarks of yours
as to the intemperance of temperance advo-
cates. How much of the energy of these loud
snorters may be owing to the alcohol they
denounce—energy inherited, perhaps, from
ancestral wine-bibbers? For it can hardly be
a coincidence that the three great progressive
races, the spawning, dominating peoples, the
British, German, and Russian, are now, and
always have been, enormous consumers of
strong drink. Certainly the Briton, since the
time his ancestors drank mead from the skulls
of their enemies, has been a drunkard; Ins
aggressive energy seems to have developed, by
the habit ; for only in this respect is he notably
superior to many of the people he has con-
quered. The south of Europe, Turkey in-
cluded, is notoriously temperate—it should be
the Paradise of Good Templars ; but one fails to
hear of aught exemplary reported from that
direction. Medical testimony, that once sup-
ported the apostolic injunction to “ take a little
wine,” is now nearly solid for the cold-water
party ; but does it not prove too much ? Should
not our race have been exterminated genera-
tions ago, if the cold-water deductions are cor-
rect? Alcohol may be a curse to individuals, it
may cause much of the evil charged against it;
but this is the handicap attached to all special
advantages. You excel at your peril. Nature
gives only two-edged swords. The three-bottle
man, who lords it over millions of Hindoos,
puts his son in an asylum for inherited
alcoholism. Newgate is crammed with criminals,
Westminster Abbey full of heroes, suckled on
the bottle. Genius is notoriously intemperate,
whilst cold-water and mediocrity are twins.
Australia’s future in this respect looks gloomy.
The young bushman has little taste for.alcohol;
he prefers to ruin his digestion with billy tea ;
and to suppose a great race can be developed on
the cat-lap of Confucius is to ignore all his-
torical experience.—H.F.
A Vic. legal correspondent addresses The Bul-
letin ve the Law Society of Victoria, just
established for the purpose of effecting the
unification of the legal profession in Victoria,
and thus to give effect to the Act of the Legisla-
ture passed in 1891 ” :
Some of the reasons that justify the founding of the
Law Society are—
-1 The scales of costs have not been altered since the
professions of barristers and solicitors were combined.
The .Judges have allowed four years to pass without
making any effort to give effect to the new law. Instead
of accepting the new law, they sneer at those who obey
the law ; tney smile upon those who endeavor to make the
law abortive. . ~ __ , ~ , ,
If a lawyer conducts a case in the County Court, he will
be allowed— practically speaking—only one-half the costs
he would have obtained if he briefed another lawyer to
appear at court. Is this right !
If a lawyer makes an application to a Supreme Court
Judge—say in Chambers—he will be allowed one guinea.
If he briefs another lawyer, the Judge will allow 7 three
guineas. Is this right? Thus on.
In spite of the Judges, however, the keenness of compe-
tition in the profession is forcing amalgamation. Already
in the county court, the Insolvent Court, in general
sessions, in the criminal court, in the assize courts
throughout the country, one man conducts the proceed-
ing °Selborne Chambers are agitated. Briefs are fewer.
The future is to the competent man who knows his profes-
sion, not to the society bantling of an attorney who re-
tains another man to give opinions, draw pleadings and
conduct all proceedings.
9 The Law Institute, of course, consists of the swell
solicitors for the banks and building societies, insurance
offices, wealthy squatters, &c., &c. —the old firms accus-
tomed to the old ways. They, of course, don t want to
appear in court. They brief another man to do the work.
Now is it not right that struggling merit should have a
chance ’ Is not open competition the wisest course ? Let
the man who does the work reap the reward. Under the
present scales of costs the man who briefs another to do
the work gets the reward.
3. If the scales of costs were remoulded, litigation
would be much cheaper. . , . ,
4 If the unification of the profession were a real fact
and not a mere theory, procedure would be revolutionised
and consequently cheapened. There would be no expen-
sive briefs to draw, statements of claim, statements of
defence, replies ; seldom orders for interrogatories, orders
for inspection and other interlocutory applications that
prolong proceedings and swell expense. Whilst a law-
suit has to pay (1) an attorney and his clerks (2), a
barrister and his clerk ; but nearly always two and fre-
quently three barristers with their clerks, the costs must
be prohibitive.— Barrister and Solicitor.

The Commercial Banking Co., of Sydney is
almost the only one this half-year which doesn’t show a
downward tendency. 'Jhe profits are £40,303, whereas
the previous half-years panned out for £39,474, £38,037
and £36,599 respectively. The usual div. at 8 per cent,
per annum absorbs £39,965, leaving £338 to the good.
The paid-up capital is now £1,000,000; reserve £1,010,000 ;
and balance to credit of profit and loss, £15,071. The
deposits (£9,976,000), advances, note-issues and cash-
reserve all show a decline, but still the Com-
mercial of Sydney has the magnificent coin re-
serve of £2,388,000; and coin and liquid securities
together amount to £3,066,000. Altogether, it is a very
sohd-lookmg institution, and the fact that its profits are
a little better than they were six months ago is note-
worthy. The last half-year has been one of general
disaster, and almost every other bank in the Eastern pro-
vinces whose June balance-sheet has yet appeared shows
the effect in diminished profits—very seriously diminished
m some cases.

Treasurer Reid is absolutely unequalled at
r o a W lce - o , ourt smartness. P’rinstance : Three of the
■N.B.W. loans have sinking-funds attached. There is an
annual payment of £70,000 a year to cover principal and
interest on the Railway loan of 1867; £150,000 a year
under the Treasury Bills Act of 1889 ; and £75,000 a year
under the Railway loan of 1889. Other Treasurers simply
included these payments in the “ Special appropriations,”
where they weren’t noticed. G. Reid puts them under a
serrate heading as “ Payments in reduction of the public
*~">, ± ' 259 > 00 9 —the amount ought to be £295,000, but
that doesn t signify with G.R.-and already the Freetrade
tocsin is being banged about Georgey Reid as the first
Treasurer who started to pay off the public debt. The
great George R. knows more small halfpenny dodges than
a monkeys. 8
Bank of Sydney produces a balance-
sheet for the half-year ended 30th June, which isn’t calcu-
lated to make the proprietors feel good. The dividend,

J* " s the City Bank is that it always earns almost the
exact amount of its dividend. The previous half-year its

The half-yeai ending June, 95, ifc earned its 5 per cent.

. The lmlt-year’s report of the Commercial Bank
of Australia is mostly disaster. The loss for the six
months is £24,054, as compared with a profit of £lOBO last
and lff at J 2?? e ’ ’St : £]3 > 351 at December, ’94;

P r ' ° dts of two years ago. Considering that this

by £470,000, a decrease of £6OOO in the half-year’s ex-
penses, and a decrease of £600,000 in the fixed deposits—
which means a saving of £13,000 in interest for the half-year
T, a r ompi \T. l Wltb ’94, this decline is something enormous.
There is nothing m the balance-sheet to show why the

thTrtrt if f lB . 4 ’ 000 -. The liquidation of the dead assets of
Ol d bank is getting on steadily, the amount being
du f ced Slnce lasfc balance-sheet by £200,000. These dead
they didZst V h»’lf Seei^ tohaVe eamed a ° ood deal less than
,/‘ 6y . dld laB * half, and consequently appear to be getting
deader as time goes on, and possibly this is where the
trouble mostly comes in. As far as can be llrned by
X,f athel ' fanty information supplied, £5,868,000 of
actual!v ° f ante-reconstruction days are now
actually realising only a minute fraction over 1* per cent
per-amium, whereas only a year ago they seemed to be
realising considerably over 2 per cent., which is a con
siderable difference. Apparently, the Commercial is
steadily realising the best of the old assets and is fast
getting down to—well, to the sulphide stratum.
When the Commercial's re-construction scheme
was announced, The Bulletin (in its issue of July 11) ex-
nn)Sihd the opinion that it didn’t provide enough lelief to
Pmt ban , s rtaight. Apparently, the opinion, in which
this paper stood practically alone, was justified. At the
L Jff nnmB i! kb. 6 institution will save about £29,000 each
half-year by the new arrangement, and apparently £2l 000
of that is gone already, and there is no guarantee that tom
about e £ls ono* ; •° o,lti Tv, 1899 the saving will'be only
ab °ut. £15,000 in each half-year, so, unless there is a
material improvement, the institution will, on present
figures, be £9OOO to the bad. Things pro a) 1 , f
prove but the margin, if there is one, Fs patefully s nafi'
and there is no evidence that there is anv margin at all’
The Bulletin still thinks that the State should come to
the rescue of the Commercial, which is too big an institu

fad; a " d f‘ve its creditors 2 per cent, debentures In pay!

and exchange rates have been cut down vlry low by
severe competition, and the fall in the Victoria’s profit 3
probably arises in part from this cause. The usual 5 per
cent. div. on preference shares takes £10,41!), and £464Tis
carried to profit and loss, making the balance £31,410.
When next balance-sheet appears the Victoria will have
the benefit of a large saving of interest through the re-
lease of one-fifth of its deposits, and with these prospects
m front it was possibly justified in paying the aforesaid
5 per cent., though in the present unsettled condition of
things any dividend is an arguable question. During the
half-year the Victoria has reduced its liability to deposi-
tors by £600,00.'), and in spite of this great reduction its
cash balance is larger than it was six months ago, and its
liquid securities(£l,7o3,l6o)are £12,000 better.' The cash
and Government debentures alone equal 24j/> per cent, on
all liabilities to the public, and the business looks
thoroughly sound and prosperous. It certainly seems as
it the Victoria could release its deposits with absolute
safety 7 very much faster than it is doing.

reserves in Australasia ; and it looks solid in everv
respect. •’

Business is evidently booming with the S.A.
otate Land Bank now that it has really got into operation.
A very few weeks ago it made a start by issuing £20,000
worth of 3J4 per cent, bonds, which were taken up locally
at over £lO2. Since then £lO,OOO worth have been pri-
vately sold ; £30,000 were issued the other day, and were
rushed by the public at a premium ; and another £5O 000
worth are shortly to be issued. This shows that the State
iiank is already doing a considerable business. As it
issues its bonds in small quantities, the Adelaide market
is quite large enough for its purpose, and will probably
continue so, even when the transactions have run into
! n “' I ,°, ns - The bank has no big unproductive balances on
hand to pay interest upon ; the premiums received on the
ponds sold have, so far, gone a long way to pay the work-
ing expenses of the institution ; and the bonds themselves
are a convenient and valuable investment. Altogether,
Kingston s Land Bank scheme seems, so far as the evi-
invpnt h | ave gone ’ the most P erfect thing of its kind
invented up to now.

justification for paying more than 5 or 6 per cent at

and uncertain as scrubbing a live lion, and, untilthings
improve !t is decidedly reckless to cut things so fine as
the Southern Co. has been doing. S S 0 nne as

wdl their money back. Some of them will
probably invest it m enterprises that will pay better than
the one they are ejected from, and seme in entelmrise a
that pay worse. The latter might, with some faint show
of reason, have a claim on the State to make “•ood their
loss, but, if so, the State has an equally good claim on the
former to compensate it for the service it rendered them
by driving them to a more profitable occupation. More-
over, if the State should compensate the dispossessed
shareholders then the dispossessed employes have an
equa ly good claim. And if the Standard Insurance Co
should be paid for the destruction by law of its fire busi-
ness, then have not Goodiet and Smith, of Sydney a
much better claim to be compensated for the destruction
0f th ,Y, lr c f nent business, seeing that they not only
lost the profits of the cement trade but also a lot of the
capital invested m it ? In short, where does the com-
pensation question end ?

The Australian Gas Light Co. (Sydney) has
- Id f n , >y been struck by the depression. The profits for
the half-year are £46,874, which is considerably below the
average. The dividend at 15 per cent, per annum
absorbs £51,135, so the co. goes £4261 to the bad in its
efforts to keep up the old rate, and the balance at credit
of pioht and loss diminishes from £6226 to £1965. How
long the co. can go on at this rate the board which is
mostly Cohen and should consider seriously.

, r^J le is disappointing-. After the
x’u?uri° t s e Sllver -mining boom everywhere lead was to
steadily advance; and so it did. The B.H fToml V!
imaged £9 12s. in the middle six months of '94, and
the average rose in successive half-years to £9 18s.,
±lO Bs. Id., and £ll Is. Bd. Still, that is a long distance
irom the £l5 realised in ’BB. But lately the market has
been very erratic. At the beginning of last December it
t the middle of March it was down
to £lO 17s. 6d. Since then it has improved a trifle. Sta-
tistics are unreliable; but most likely the new sulphide-
plants, which turn out proportionately more lead than
silver, are having an effect. As for the B.H. Proprietary,
however, the fall in lead-production has been out of pro-
portion to the fall in silver-production. The biggest
silver out-turn in any half-year was 7,287,3370 z. in the first
. of ’94 ; last half-year the out-turn .was
4,10/ ~>7Boz. The biggest out-turn of lead was in the
nrst half of ’92 —20,843 tons, as against 11,958 tons last
half year.
During the first half-year of its existence the
* rom the B.H. Proprietary Co.’s mine averaged
741%°z. per ton. Last half-year the average was 18'84oz.
A tip for Westralian speculators. How the B.H. mine
was gutted of easily-operated lead ores is shown by the
uechne m the average extraction of lead. Term by term
it has de Cl d from 15 . 71 p er oen k j n beginning of
92 to i ’O4 last half-year. And along with that have, of
course, fallen profits—from an average of £4 ss. 6d. per
ton of ore treated in ’9l to £1 2s. sd. per ton in the last
term.
B.H. Proprietary Co’s record to date of last re-
(H years): Ore treated, 2,884,930 tons; silver,

Prom June 1, ’95, to Nov. 30, ’95, the B.H.P.

last six months, £21,340. General-manager Stewart men-
tions that “the consumption of timber in the undisturbed
portions of the workings has been further reduced, and it
is expected it will be possible to reduce the amount re-
quired to still lower limits.” Look out!

stulr is compact and, in the present state of metallurgical
knowleduT-, absolutely valueless. In the official and semi-
official reports, though, the ore is made to appear almost
cA )O !’ enough, with a fair percentage of lead and 9oz. or so
of silver. But not a word about the excessively high per-
centage of zinc so intimately associated with the other
metals as to destroy the value of the ore.

According to Sydney E. News, two plodding
miners have for two years been mining for gold in the
immediate vicinity of Botany Bay. They have been
working stone of a most extraordinary character, *‘re
tj- 1 ?! , s^es bacon.” Kaolin, similar “to the Broken
liill stuff,” has also been met. They have had to pene
trate the rock with hammer and gad, “explosives being
h O Su- ostly '” Assa^s . show gold ldwt. 15grs., silver l9grs.
This the men admit would not pay to cart for crushing,
but they are confident that, if a small plant could be
erected adjacent to the mine, it could be kept going with
payable results.” It is very important to learn that the
miners living four miles away have to walk that distance
in the morning, and the same distance back in the even-
ing, after working in the shaft all day.

The burning question up Nundle way (N.S.W.)
at present is “ Are they diamonds or are they zircons ? ”
If diamonds, then Nundle is going to be second only to
Kimberley, and the Bingara and Boggy Creek diamond-
mines will not be in it, in which case the writer will be
very sorry for Capt. Rogers, the blind diamond octogena-
rian, who supplies the Sydney papers with periodical sen-
sations. The N.S.W. Govt. Geologist, backed up bv Prof.
M Coy, of Melb., has declared that the stones submitted
are zircons, but a London cable says they are diamonds
and worth 10s. a carat, and the people of Nundle on this
occasion prefer to believe the cable. “ Well, if they are
diamonds,” said a miner to the writer last week, “ I know
where I can get a cart-load of ’em ? ” The indefatigable
Dowell “ has pegged out a large area.” This phrase has
appeared so often of late years that the public must
wonder what has become of all the other large areas
pegged out by the same Mr. Dowell, and if they nre all in
an active state of development how much of NSW
mineral lands are left unpegged by Dowell 7

The writer of the articles bn the W. A. goldfields
appearing in Melbourne Age and Sydney D.T. is “ Billy ”
Briggs, a well-known member of the Age staff, who had
some years’ hard practical mining experience on Bendigo,
and was afterwards for some years mining-reporter for
the Bendigo Independent. Unlike 99 per cent, of jour-
nalists who attempt to write on mines, Briggs knows
something about his business. He practically confirms
what has been said in these columns for the last two
years —that the Coolgardie-boom will yet be known as
the biggest fraud of the nineteenth century. Of the 12
miles around Coolgardie, he says : “It is amazing to con-
template the immense amount of capital sunk. It wearies
one to drive mile after mile through this inhospitable
bush and see an endless succession of shafts sunk in the
hope of picking up another Londonderry or Bayley’s
Reward. Some have succeeded in finding fairly strong
bodies of unpayable ore, but a large majority have failed
to even find a reef.”
* * * *
It lias transpired that a parcel, alleged to con-
tain 400 oz. gold, forwarded from a Westralian mine to
Melbourne mint, contained only lOoz. gold, the remainder
being iron. Clever theft or blushless booming—which ?
• * * »
At last another reported rich strike comes from
Bayley’s : “The stone is precisely similar to that from the
mine in its palmy days.” If so, then it’s 1000 to 1 that it
will be lost as suddenly as it was found. As if in its
favor, it is said that the find has not been made in the
Reward mine proper, but at the 100 ft. level from Cock-
shott’s shaft, 60ft. to the north. Other pockets were get
from time to time in the vicinity of that shaft three years
ago.

Kalgoorlie : “ Splendid specimens have been
brought in from the Golden Crescent mine, Black Flag,
assaying over 6!)oz. to the ton. It is proposed to float the
mine in the East or on the field.” The writer predicts
that the East will have a chance of going into this show.
A mine with splendid specimens and 60oz. stone could not
possibly be worked without floating. Where would the
money for machinery come from ?

The £30,000 representing the unpaid part of the
Plunderderry purchase-money locked up for shortage of
area, was released by order of Justice A’Beckett in Mel-
bourne last week. The owners’ shares, 116,000, have also
been released in London. Mills and party have now had
£lBO,OOO cash and 116,000 shares, and J. Bull has the
mine. But the trouble is not all over. The owners claim
heavy damages at law for the alleged illegal lock'ng-up of
their shares, which prevented them from quitting when
the scrip was as much above par as it is now below.
* * * *
Another crushing from Brown Hill mine, W.A.:
119 tons for 2740 z. This was the mine which the news-
paper hummers declared twice a week for months would
lick the Boulder. It is now all on account of the dry
crushing-mill, which was also going to do great things.
When is the public going to get an official denial that the
bottom of this mine is “ dicky ” ?
* * * *
Great news founded on great assays has been
received and widely published in London about the amaz-
ing richness of the Star of Coolgardie mine, now worked
by the Flagstaff Co. A sample sent to London by the
manager was assayed for a return of 260 z. to the ton.
“This the directors viewed as so exceptional that they
cautioned shareholders against looking upon it otherwise
than as specimens of unusual richness.” A similar
opinion was sent to the manager. However, someone has
officially reported from the field (so it is printed in a
London paper) that “thousands of tons of stone of this
class can he got. If the ore had been free milling there is
no doubt that before now this would have been a notorious
mine ; the only thing to make it so now is a suitable
plant for extracting the precious metal.” The examiner
does not say, it would seem, what sort of a plant would
be suitable to save such rich “ tack.” The trial crushing
put through Bayley’s battery was a failure—from which
it would seem that a stamp mill is quite out of the ques-
tion. Yet the same report says, “ arrangements have
bem made to use 10 heads of the United Mill, and a 50-ton
trial is now being made.” This is dated London, June-18.
At 260 z. the 50 tons should have returned 130)oz. The
Bulletin has not heard of it, but expects to find that it is
all in the tailings, as usual. N.B. —The fact that this
mine, with 200 tons of this 260 z. ore at grass, was sold for
£lOO, does not appear in the London financial papers.

Prince Regent, Ballarat, has had no rich speci-
mens to boost its half’s yield, hence the poor return of
4970 z. 18dwt. from 1765 tons. When the deeper levels are
tackled, however, the mine should do well, if the success
of the adjoining claim is any criterion.
Shenandoah, one of Bendigo’s deep-level div.-
payers, last half knocked 48430 z. lOdwt. from 6953 loads
from the reef at 2782 ft. ; div., £11,200-equal to 7s. per
share. Good quantity of stone yet to stope, and im-
proving as it gets north of the slide met some time back.
New Chum Railway still wears a healthy look,
the reef standing well up to 30ft. thick, and milling a
fair average—about an ounce. Going deeper, another
lift to get at that portion of the reef gone underfoot in the
south end.
Eureka Extended has to face an 800 ft. sink before
it can expect to out the N.C. Railway’s reef—a work that
will bleed scrippers heavily. At present, the co. is
struggling with a thin make of stone at 1230 ft., with
medium results.
Koch’s Pioneer, while seeking the Windmill
Hill reef with its 1250 ft. north level, is stamping divs. out

touched. Bi-term results : 5496 loads for 34550 z. lOdwt.—
average 13dwt.; div., £11,875. Good talk for a mine
labelled “ dead ” about a year ago.
New Prince of Wales dropped hack last half to
an Sdwt. average, reducing 2820 loads for 1084 oz. 7dwt.
So far prospecting below 300 ft. has not proved anything
brilliant, but the co. is hopeful that it will shortly happen
on to the rich shoots coming down from the upper levels.

The half-year shows the average yield is lower than the
previous term by 3dwt. 13grs. per ton, evidence that the
vast body of flat spurs in the 685 ft. level is badly slump-
ing in gold contents. Divs., £2400.

“The Victorian Mount Morgan” is on the
market with reports of its great possibilities. Five tons
put through a battery on Bendigo returned 2oz. Bdwts.,
and on this big calculations have been made. The con-
centrates, of which there were 15 per cent., assayed Boz.
Mr. Thureau, late Tas. Govt, geologist, says 7 dwts. per
ton will cover all charges. E. M. Cairnes,
3dwts. ore should leave a margin for profit even with a
10-head battery. James Clingan, who signs himself
“ mining-manager, Bendigo,” “ full}' believes that this
lode will eclipse Mt. Morgan in size and returns, for the
ore can be mined and crushed for a cost of 3s. per ton.”
These are not the only discrepancies. Thureau says there
is sufficient water-power available to operate 40 to 50
heads; Cairnes, that it is enough for 100 heads, at least,
and Clingan confirms this estimate. The latter is the
discoverer. No mine can be proved a Mt. Morgan by
treating 500 tons, much less five. Why is the report of the
Yic. Govt, geologist, who recently examined the show,
not published?
* * * *
From London comes the first news of the
Frederick the Great crushing (Bendigo)—4so tons, gross

So possibly were the English shareholders. The prospect
of J. Bull and Co. taking any more Bendigo mines after
this is not very bright. Like Australia with English
artists, Bu’l gets Australian mines when they are pretty
well played out.

S.S.: A capper for your story of the brand-new
miners who used a whole coil of fuse in exploding a
charge. The manager of the Golden Crown had put on a
couple of wild, shaggy “miners,” on the order of a city
director, who guaranteed them to be careful and experi-
enced workers. They went into the winze at No. 2, night
shift, and, at about 2 a.m., the manager was knocked up,
and heard a voice in the darkness: “Be gob, sor ! the
fuse ye gav us won’t do at all, at all.” “ How’s that, you
furious galloot ? ” “ We’ve thried it, sor, an’ it won’t rach

The latest cry of the Sydney Woman Suffra-
gists : “ Equal work and equal pay, for women as for
men,” is one that the male trades-unionist ought to back
up. Care should be taken, however, that the equal
pay ” does not level down to the present woman s standard,
but that it rises to the man’s. When a typographical
union denied membership to a female compo., it com-
mitted a blunder typical of acts of foolishness that are
being done all along the line of sex demarcation. A
female doctor deserves as high a fee as a male doctor
who is not more efficient than she ; a female typewriter
ought to be as well paid as a male one ; a female compo.
should charge as high rates as her male colleague. The
of females from trades-unions, however, pre-
vents all this. It does not keep the female out of trade
competition ; it merely lowers the “ minimunnwages.”
As a modern mining-camp, Cripple Creek,
Colorado, U.S., wins easily from all others. It is but four
years old, and last year returned one-sixth of the gold-
output of the States. In the absence of fuel, the ore has
to be transported sucb a distance that all under 2oz. rock
is left for future treatment. Of the 2000 claims taken,
over 400 are regularlv sending away ore. Forty-eight
men who went there within the last four years have made
over a million dollars each. The output for the first three
months of this year was 50,000 tons, from which over
£500,000 in gold was got.
Westralia either has the gold or has it not. On
the chance, a mere toss-up, W.A. has been capitalised up
to the capital value of the Rand. The capital has been
mostly got out of British speculators, on reports and pro-
spects crammed with lies—which are tie only ‘proofs
that W.A. is uniquely auriferous. The p’oof that it isn it,
is that it didn’t produce £1,000,000 worth of gold in its
tenth year.

There is a legend that several smart, out-of-
work canvassers once got ahead of an insurance society
for a tidy sum by a very simple ruse. The co. allowed
commission in certain cases, sa} v , ten times the
first premium handed in by the canvassers from the
assured. Thus in infant insurance, say 3d. weekly is the
premium. The system was for the canvasser to send m
the name of the infant he assured with 3d., the amount of
first premium, and to receive as his “ commish ” from the
co. 2s. 6d., the co. trusting to future payments to make it
all right. The co. in question was doing a big biz. in
infant assurance, which suddenly ceased. It seems the
canvassers had filled in some hundreds of names (genuine
enough), planked down their own threepences, and
cleared 2s. 3d. a head profit from the co. The lapsing of
98 per cent, of the business before a fortnight passed gave
the whole thing away.

Westralian leaseholders and small syndicates
are lamenting. The present stir is in scrip. Many claims
are always on the point of being sold, but in most cases
it fails to come off. A mine is never sold nowadays till
the money is down.

Writes a pick-and-drill expert from Westralia to
a Bulletin man : “The locals here wail about the scarcity
of water, and wonder what wouldn’t their great country
be if this district had a few decent rivers, but this lack of
water has been the making of the place. Take it from
me, if there had been plenty of water here hundreds of
well-boomed mines would have duffered-out long ago.”
It is not generally known that Australian diggers
played an important part in opening up the mines in
Mashonaland. In 1864 Karl Mauch brought back accounts
from that region verifying Livingstone’s stories of alluvial
gold washed out by the natives. People laughed ; but a
party of Australians thought the thing worthy of a trial,
and in ’67 a band of them went north and set up a small
battery on the Tete (near Zambesi). This was the first
serious attempt in modern times at gold-mining in South
Africa.

A miner, in recommending to N.S.W. the
M.L. custom of fines for evasion of labor conditions
instead of forfeiture, makes a very sensible suggestion.
Insecurity of tenure is the curse of the industry. And when
a lease is forfeited the State should at least share the
plunder with the jumper.

A recent English decision (Paterson v. Gas Light
Co.) has much interest for gas-consumers. It shows
clearly that an incoming tenant is not liable for the arrears
of gas incurred by the preceding tenant, unless by virtue
of an agreement between them. The case was one for an
injunction to restrain the Gas Co. from cutting off the
supply on default of payment of said arrears. Australian
cities are not altogether unacquainted with this develop-

An applicant fora junior clerical position (i.e.,
office-boyship) in any Sydney bank nowadays undergoes
much ordeal ere the billet heaves in view. The formal
letter of application requires to be personally substantiated
by one or two well-known citizens, customers of the par-
ticular bank preferred. Then a letter to the secretary of
the Bankers’ Institute is handed by the bank-manager to
the cowering candidate, authorising his examination by
the Institute, and directing that official to forward the
result to the B.M. The C.C. presents this, and is notified
to attend upon a certain day, the field of examination
being specified. However, on arrival of due date he again
attends, and is then requested to fork over £1 for exam.-
fne, no previous intimation of this charge having been
given. The despairing youth hastens forth, returns with
this sum and his stock of lore re English history, geo-
graphy, English composition, French, arithmetic, &c.,
and is then inspected. Then, should rival applicants
have been bested, he is, after further formality, duly ap-
pointed to the position upon three months’ probation,
after which he draws a salary of £25 for an indefinite
period. Truly, bank-billets are not what they were before
the boom.
Dear Bulletin, —Be the “age of consent,”
a long medical experience tells me that the older
(within certain limits) a woman or girl is the more
easy she is to seduce. Therefore, would it not be
more logical to enact that—instead of, as at pre-
sent, under 16 —no woman shall be competent to
give consent over the age of 25 or 30 ? This would
cover everything.—Yours, F.R.C.S.

Jim was a shearer—a jolly young fellow
whom everybody liked. But he wasn’t called Jim
—“ Let-a-fellow-sleep ! ” was his name ; for, lazy
snoozer ! the phrase was always in his mouth.
They had just cut out at W ,on the Barwon ;
and Jim, wanting to make a daylight start and
knowing his weakness, had asked the boys to call
him bright and early. They did. “Gome on,
turn out, sleepy ! ” “ Here, ‘ Let-a-fellow ’ ! Jim !
wake up ! ” “My God ! Jim’s dead !” _ Then
someone remembered having heard him say
drowsily, in the middle of the night, “ Stop it,
chaps ! let a fellow sleep ! ” They found the snake
—a black one—coiled up in the blankets. Poor
Jim ! He lies just opposite the woolshed, on the
sunrise side. There is a stake with a board nailed
across, and on the board is painted with tar and
turps: “ Jim, shearer, aged 21. Let a fellow
sleep.”
A blind Melbourne man, notable for the
facility with which he traverses the crowded
streets, says that the sense of smell is his chief
guide to locality. He can easily detect the odor of
restaurants, tailors’, fruiterers’, tobacconists’ and
other shops, and can even distinguish between the
city’s most fashionable cafe and other restaurants,
and between certain of the hotels. The sense of
feeling is also used ; the material of which the
building is composed being a guide. Sound is a
further aid, the passing traffic having a different
ring, as the buildings are low or lofty. On a
Sunday, when the shops are closed, he experiences
greater difficulty in finding his way about.
Dear Bulletin, —In my native comer of
Britain there is a particularly sturdy brand of
Presbyterian who mostly refuses to “ kiss the
book,” and for whom the oath-administrator, as
the witness raises his right hand, makes the ad-
dendum : “Do you consider this form binding on
your conscience ? ” And, with the answer “yes !”
the witness is considered duly sworn. The cere-
mony is probably just as futile as kissing a bit of
greasy leather, but there’s a dignified simplicity
about it that makes it look like a better guarantee
of veracity. And, anyhow—putting aside the dirt
and danger of the Bible-mumbling mummery-
will any believer therein explain—l: Would a
torn-out leaf invalidate the oath ? 2: If not,
would a single remaining leaf carry the whole
weight of the Wurrd ? 3 : If not, again, at what
precise number of pages, or lines, or words, does
hell-fire for the false-witness begin ?—Pagan.
With farther reference to a paragraph in
The Bulletin of June 6, based on statements
which Q. ex-Chief Justice Lilley was reported to
have made in Brisbane Courier of May 26, to
the effect that a letter published as from him in
Sydney Daily Telegraph of May 23 was “not one
consecutive letter, but a compilation from several
letters ” which he had written to Mr. J. T. Ryan,
and was “apparently a free condensation ” of his
letters : The Bulletin is assured on behalf of
Mr. Ryan that “the letter published was an exact
copy of Sir Charles Lilley’s letter ” to him, “ and
the matter was contained in one complete letter.”
The Bulletin accordingly withdraws unre-
servedly the paragraph referred to, and tenders to
Mr. Ryan its sincere apology for the paragraph’s
appearance.
Certain female crusaders, having learned

At Melbourne, on Monday, that dangerous
and notorious criminal, Butler, who had been
acquitted of robbery-under-arms, but had pleaded,
guilty to housebreaking, was sentenced to 15 years’
penal servitude with periods of solitary confine-
ment. Prisoner, on leaving the dock, exclaimed
that the sentence was brutal and iniquitous
which, in at least one respect, it, in The
Bulletin’s opinion, emphatically was: for when
society has safely caged its human tiger, now
beyond middle age, for a term the expiry of which
will see him a grey-haired if not a decrepit
man, why should it torture him with
solitary confinement ? Then the Judge, after
rebuking Butler for his exclamation, said that
THE PRISONER BUTLER.
lie had only meant to pass a sentence of ten
years —which the prisoner will now serve. Butler,
it is said, was at one period of his life a school-
master ; he is a man of rare but perverted natural
ability, and has on more than one occasion dis-
played such talent in the conduct of his own
defence as to make it more than clear that, under
other circumstances, he might easily have become
an ornament to the Bar. Rarely has there been
seen behind the spikes in any country a man
endowed with such cynical eloquence and facility of
generalisation. Apropos, it is interesting to note,
re Butler’s remark that “people who part their
hair in the middle usually have weak minds,”
that Butler himself, at or about the time he was
tried in Dunedin (1(5 years ago) for the murder of
the Dewars, wore his hair parted in the middle as
shown in the accompanying old photo.
Despite the antiquity ot the belief that
the human animal isn’t naturally intended to wear
any more clothes than it’s born with, it is a bit of
a staggerer to find that nakedness-unashamed will
shortly be upon us here in Australia, in the
person of one Macdonald (good name for bare
legs!), who, “in the interests of beauty and
morality,” has been happening along in England
“ mid nodings on ” except a light netted shirt and
a rudimentary pair of pants. Full-dress, this ;
as for the other thing—” Myself and my neigh-
bors,” records the ingenuous Mac, “experienced
the greatest amusement when I was working ” (in
the fields) “ completely undraped / ” If this apostle
of starkitude doesn’t lose, en voyaqe, the courage
of his opinions, The Bulletin will await with
much interest the efforts of the Social Purity
people, per medium of the large, blushful police-
man, to have him provided with clothes—and
board and lodging to boot —at Government ex-
pense.
It is reported that the Venezuela frontier-
dispute may, after all, be submitted to arbitration.
At present Britain has five chronic disputes in
South and Central America. One is with Ar-
gentina, from which the dear old mother-country
snavelled the Falkland Islands. One is with
Venezuela, over the ever-extending boundaries of
British Guiana. There is also a dispute with
Brazil over the southern boundary of Guiana, and
another over the island of Trinidad, which was
grabbed a few months ago. And the fifth
dispute is with Guatemala, which is being slowly
eaten up by the unaccountable expansion of British
Honduras. A sixth difficulty is preparing on the
Mexican-British Honduras border, which is also
undefined, and keeps moving. British colonies, in
regions like these, grow by their own volition.
Fifty years ago the British in Guiana persuaded
the Brazilians to move out of a little forlorn border-
town, then claimed by both parties, and arbitrate
over the ownership of it. Now the British frontier
has moved lOOmiles beyond that old, unsettled fron-
tier, and the border-line is still undecided. If the
Brazilians don’t get a definite settlement and build
a stone wall along the border, and put 1760 soldiers
along each mile of wall to watch that it doesn’t
shift, the British frontier will gradually wander
southward till it reaches Rio Janeiro.

The vicc-regal gravel dispute at Perth
(W. A.) has at last reached a settlement. When
Captain and Aide-de-camp St. Leger—who pro-
nounces his name “ Selliger ’’—married the
daughter of plain Gov. Smith, it appears that he
caused gravel to be spread outside the cathedral
to lend tone to the proceedings, and he sent the
gravel bill to the municipal council on the ground
that he had been repairing the roads. Council re-
fused to pay on the ground that no unauthorised
person had any right to interfere with tiie roads,
llm captain then stated that if the bill wasn’t
paid he might cause the gravel to be scraped up
again and removed. The council replied that the
captain couldn’t remove anything off the road
without its permission. Then the captinck sim-
gested that they should—haw—pay the bill

is so delicate that he cannot go through the fatigue
of preaching a sermon—a fault which has made
him popular in the sacred city. The couple, how-
ever, will not depend upon pew-rents for their
bread and butter, as Mr. Hawker is heavily gilded
and his bride received a handsome dot.

The wedding-gift of the future will not be
counted on as a realizable asset. Some recent
local fashionable marriages have shown that this
system of social blackmailing is falling to pieces.
Hem-stitched doyleys and photo.-frames are now
held even by relatives as an equivalent for an in-
vitation to the obsequies and a nibble at the bridal
show-bread, when formerly no guest would feel
honorably franked for the ceremony by anything
under a plated egg-frame or a whole case of tea-

As the age of consent will soon be a burn-
ing question in Australian Parliaments a glance
at the legal marriage ages of Europe may enable
advocates on both sides of the important theme to
buttress their theories with statistical facts. For
instance, in Switzerland a man at 14 may marry a
woman at 12. In Spain, Greece and Portugal the
same law holds good. In Hungary a Catholic
man at 14 may marry a Catholic woman at 12, but
if Protestants the man must be 18 and the woman
15. In Belgium the man must be 18 and the
woman 15. In Austria both must be 14. In Ger-
many the man must be 18 and the woman 15 ; in
France the man 18 and the woman 15; and in
Turkey both at puberty.
Miss Janet Michie, a foremost Melbourne
woman’s rights advocate, writes in the Age of
“ those unnatural men who oppose us.” This is a
turning of the tables on the part of the short-
haired women and long-haired men. The general
idea was that the unnatural man was the long-
haired sort that shrieked for “ woman’s rights.
True there is now a class of sweet girl graduates
on the woman’s rights platform whom any natural
man would wish to support with all his arms—it is
the ancient order, which passeth, that he finds
insupportable.

One of the most popular of Melb. girls,
Miss Marie Torrance, was married last week to
Mr. Geo. Lyne, who has brought gold from the
West. Among the Yic. artists Miss Torrance has
long reigned as a sort of innocent Trilby ; her
pretty, vivacious face painted by Fox was seen m
Paris Salon last year, and the picture was pre-
sented by the artists to the bride as a wedding-
gift. 4 ,

The “ladies” of Bundaberg (Q.), who feed
their “ slaveys ” on 21 meals of fried liver per
week, are agitating for the renewal of servant-girl
immigration. They want servants, willing to
accept cheap wages, imported at State expense,
and they ask the hon. member for Simpson (elected
through an informality in his opponent’s nomina-
tion-paper) to put the matter through for them.

“ One pound for marriage—one pound for
divorce. Nothing for marriage nothing for
divorce. I call that fair,” yelled a pot-hatted
Sydney Domain orator one Sunday lately. “ Your
barbarous law proves itself a hideous man-trap, m
that it lets a man in for a pound and won’t let
him out—unless he’s a pauper —under fifty. Ive
been there ; and I’ll never rest till your laws are
reformed in this direction. ”

Australians show
marked preference for
divorce outright as com-
pared or contrasted with
judicial separations.
When, however, these
latter take place, griev-
ances of a bitter kind
frequently arise. When
the wife obtains her
separation she discovers,
as in some recent cases,
that the maintenance
allowed her is far below
what she expected. The
Court’s finding seems to
her to depend more on
the state of its liver than
on any reasonable calcu-
lation of income and out-
lay. Of course, husbands’
incomes vary; but in-
stead of ordering a man
to pay so much per week,
the Court might bind
him to pay a certain
fixed proportion of his
income.
H. : “ Yesterday the train in which I was
ran over and killed a poor little girl, while it
was slowing into the station at the gates. ihe
most pitiful thing ever I saw. The people all
looking out of the windows, while the mangled,
bleeding sacrifice was laid on a stretcher. .Some-
one comes with her little cap,- another with a shoe.
A white quilt is fetched from the gate-cottage to
cover her. The wooden-legged gatekeeper, him-
self once the victim of a similar accident, protests
‘ I does all I can to stop ’em-.’ ‘ Whose child is
it?’ is asked; the little mates reply; and away
goes the stretcher to mother, the victim taking the
news herself, as it were, in this awful way.”

Melb. cabmen are appealing to Parliament
for protection : they want a law to enable them to
deal promptly with the man who won t pay. Is
the tribe deteriorating ? Hitherto cabby has had a
very effective way of dealing with this sort. Ihe
writer once saw and heard a Melb. cabby curse a
stockbroker from the Town Hall to the Exchange.
“ And all for sixpence ! ” somebody remarked.
“ Yes, mate,” replied the crimson Jehu, but it s
the blue, blanky principle of the thing.
Cabbies in general should demand some
such legislation as that now before the British
Parliament, dealing with the obnoxious hirer who
either can’t pay or won’t pay. Under the British
Bill cabby will be empowered to demand proof
that the hirer has money enough in his pocket to
pay. Further, if a hirer doesn’t pay he may be
arrested and held until cash is forthcoming, when,
in addition to the fare, he will also have to pay
40s. for the trouble given.
A ROTORUA LOVE SONG.
Oh, dearest, darkest maiden, my heart is calling
thee,
Come forth from out thy whare, and have a bath
with me.
The ti-tree waves a welcome; the half-moon soft
doth shine;
The sulphur fumigates the air as thy flat nose
meets mine.
All day while catching crayfish thine image went
with me —
I thought how in the warm bath I’d eat them raw
with thee.
Then come and have thy bath, love, and see the
half-moon shine,
And, eat the jucy kuras, and rub thy nose with
mine.

The second edition of the “ Trip to China-
town ” went up at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday
night, and will fill in the last two weeks of the long
season. . The difference between the new edition
and the old one lies in the musical part of the
show —the frivolity itself frivols just the same as
before. Prank Lawton, the heavenly whistler of
the co., now toots an entirely new series of melodies
which are, if possible, better than the old ones.
Lawton’s whistle is an oasis which is capable of
brightening a whole Sahara of burlesque; he makes
amends for the commonplace of the stout tenor and
the ordinariness of the stout baritone, and for the
painful resemblance of these two stout people to
each other, and for many other things besides.
The audience didn’t really want a new edition of
Lawton—the old one was good enough for any-
body ; but it accepts it with thanks all the same.
The other changes are mostly for the better, and
the signs are that “ Chinatown ” will boom to the
bitter end of the season. Mrs. Brown Potter and
the ambrosial Curly B’lew are due at the Lyceum
on the Bth. They strike Sydney at a good time
when competition is at itswery lowest and shows
are almost as scarce as bunyips on Pharaoh’s
pyramid, and if they don’t boom exceedingly
under these conditions, then there is no good in
them, and Curly is a lost and hopeless Bellew.

Bland Holt runs the “Woman’s Revenge ”
at Sydney Royal until Monday night, on which
date the bloodshot eye of Cosgrove will finally fix
Norman through the window, and Miss Watson
will be triumphantly acquitted, and the wicked
attorney will fall in the soup of retribution, all for
the very last time. After that Bland removes his
vast show to Brisbane for a three weeks’ season,
and the evergreen Maggie Moore takes possession
of the Royal on Wednesday with her “Trilby”
burlesque, the Franco-Irish maiden with the un-
dressed feet being played, of course, by Maggie
herself. This is understood to be really and truly
Miss Moore’s farewell till she comes back again,
and as a guarantee of good faith a copy of her pas-
senger ticket by the Mariposa is ad vertised on the
programme. The lady also advertises that she
comes with a specially-selected co. and a grateful
heart. The co. has already been tried in Mel-
bourne and pronounced good, and Maggie’s ad-
mirers in Sydney will take the grateful heart for
granted. When the “Trilby” season is over,
Bland Holt returns to his old quarters and pro-
poses to let loose a whole series of new plays on a
staggered public. He has about a dozen on hand,
and in at least eight of them the British flag
waves gloriously over the battle-field while the red
sun goes down on heaps of slain—after which the
hero proves his innocence, or finds the lost docu-
ment, or recovers his ancestral mansion, or some-
thing.

The Frantz Family turned up at Sydney
Tivoli on Saturday, and swept the audience off its
fc et with sheer enthusiasm. In the great art and
mystery of india-rubber bounding there is abso-
-1 itely nothing which seems to come amiss to the
Frantzes. They are the boundingest combination
this paper knows of, and they appear to be inde-
pendent of gravity and cohesion and everything
else that is possible to dispense with —except
clothes. They swallow themselves and spit them-
selves out again frequently, and any one of them
can fall up on to nothing at the shortest notice.
Also, each Frantz climbs on top of himself, and
then hauls himself up with his hands and climbs
up again. The Family is presumably an orphan,
its male parent having taken a high jump some
years ago, and not come down since. There are
three ladies and four gentlemen in the combina-
tion, which is a high-toned affair and turns somer-
saults in evening dress. If anything in these
remarks seems to approach towards fiction it must
be set down to pressure of necessity, The Bulle-
tin having used up all the facts about this remark-
able crowd during its Melbourne season. Taking
them all round they seem to about exhaust the
possibilities of acrobatism, and the next Family
which comes along in that line of business wiil
have to hustle considerably if it wants to make
bread and cheese.

Gill, the rowdy person who fell out of the
gallery at Sydney Tivoli while trying to jump
somebody else’s front-seat, and fell fatally on top
of Alfred Neander, was last week found guilty of
manslaughter and sentenced to six months. Con-
sidering the hobnailed rowdyism of the case,
the public wastes little sympathy over Mr.
Grill. Further, he was ordered to enter
into his own recognisances to be of good be-
haviour and not fall on top of anyone else for a
period of 12 months ; so, if he does fall on anyone
within that period, his recognisances will be for-
feited. As he probably has no earthly use for his
recognisances, and never knew until now that he
possessed any, the chances are that he doesn’t care
much. The simple faith of the bench in recog-
nisances as a means of putting down rowdyism is
touching and beautiful to behold.

on the 22nd, and the very last ef all in Adelaide
on 11th September. After which the Rev. Clark
—the best lecturer who ever struck this country,
and the only man who ever made a pile by lectur-
ing in Australia —moves Englandwards, with no
expectation of ever coming back..

Nat Goodwin, supported by his company
from America, made a first appearance at Melb.
Princess’s on Saturday. The test-piece chosen for
this occasion is said to be one of the most popular
in Mr. Goodwin’s repertoire, and, insofar that its
name-part enabled him to prove his quality before
a strange audience, “A Gilded Fool ” was a suc-
cess on Saturday night. The character of the
G.F. is neither novel, nor well-constructed, nor
anyway fascinating, but the comedian obtains a
strong compound of humor and pathos from it.
Clearly, Nat Goodwin is an excellent artist, of the
quietest and most natural American type. He
exaggerates nothing, nor ever forces a point, and
he is, for intelligent people, a very acceptable con-
trast to his clever predecessor, Kyrle Bellew. To
the same extent that a polished American gentle-
man is about the “nicest” English - speaking
person of his sex, Nat Goodwin is about the
nicest sort of comic-serio actor that grows.
A less stagey performer of a somewhat impossible
character couldn’t be found. Goodwin’s gilded
fool (who is inconsistently wise at times) presents
a droll appearance and does many absurd things,
consequently his love-scenes, ridiculous to the eye,
need to be made interesting by the suggestion of a
genuine 18-carat heart. He achieves this purpose.
The unheroic Chauncey Short shows himself a
hero; and probably most of the women in the
house feel equal to adoring him at the finish,
despite his unromantic and badly-tailored per-
sonality. The leading lady, Miss Blanche Walsh,
is also an admirable artist who bestows her stage
affections on the funny man with good taste and
feeling. The human interest of the play is con-
fined to this pair of lovers.
* * * *
‘‘ A Gilded Fool ” has a poor little wire-
drawn plot running through the last three acts.
The first act simply introduces Nat Goodwin to
notice as a rather vulgar young capitalist, suffering
a recovery from an overnight drunk, in his bache-
lor’s flat. The bed and bath rooms are shut off
from the reception-room by curtains, and the
bachelor is seen tumbling from his bed to his bath-
reserve in pyjamas, after which he prowls around
in a state of uncompleted toilet. The first 40
minutes are devoted to superfluous dialogue. Then
the unscrupulous elderly-partner in a firm of
stockbrokers schemes to get the gilded fool's
capital into the business to save it from ruin, which
is objected to by the other elderly partner, who
happens to be the father of the girl. How-
ever, the fool pays money into the firm previous
to its collapse, but, at the same time, he makes a
million dollars or so by operating on his own
account, and so he reconstructs his father-in-law
elect and marries the girl, after having got rid of
the unscrupulous partner. It is a weak narrative.
The two grey-haired partners are monotonously
similar in all matters save their sense of honor,
and this one distinction makes no difference in
their acting. Two or three young men hover
around the sordid commercial incident, likewise
two middle-aged ladies, one of whom is our well-
preserved idol of other days, Miss Emelie Melville.
She is a slender idol now, but not much thinner
than at the time of her third visit to Australia.
Anyway, the audience recognised its beloved
Emelie in an instant, and gave her a warm recep-
tion.
* * * ♦
A cheerful little actress, Miss Ethel Brown-
ing, who speaks with a full twang and garbs her
frail figure to the least possible advantage, may be
said to run up and down the love-passages ; but
she, like several of the others, is only a make-
weight item in the cast. As far as one can judge
from a first piece, there is no phenomenal merit in
Mr. Goodwin’s company, apart from himself
and Miss Walsh. The other ladies seem quite
good enough, whilst the heavy gentlemen are cer-
tainly not so. As a whole, the co. doesn’t come
near to the Brough- Boucicault combination ; there-
fore, considering the recent ill-success of B. & B.
in first-class comedies, it wouldn’t be safe to pre-
dict too huge a triumph for “A Gilded Fool.” The
mounting, by G. and J. Gordon, is exceptionally
solid and regardless of expense.

At Melbourne Bijou the experiment of
“ Fun on the Bristol ” will result in “ A Trip to
Chicago,” another of John Sheridan’s musical
farces, on Saturday. A slight enlargement of the
present company will suffice to meet the new bill,
and meanwhile “ The New Housemaid ” is post-
poned indefinitely. Bijou matters are, however,
reported to be a little mixed owing to the indispo-
sition of Miss Marie Luella, and the above
arrangements are to be received with caution.
The Opera House is chiefly depending on
Charles Godfrey just now, previous to a re-
appearance of Carl Hertz, the high-toned
illusionist whom George Musgrove first imported
to Australia some years ago. Concert music has
slowed down in Melbourne for the moment, but on
Saturday a second season of Mdlle. Trebelli,
assisted by a somewhat stronger company than
before, will start at the Town Hall. Also, old
friend Musin, the violinist, is to make melody in
the Athenaeum Hall at an early date.
Maggie Moore’s good-lucky season at Melb.
Royal ends on Friday. To-night (Thursday) that
evergreen appealer to Irish sentiment revives
Struck Oil,” under distinguished patronage, for
the benefit of herself and the public at large. And
to-morrow, probably, the time-honored attraction
will repeat itself by general desire, after which the
departing manageress will speak a few farewell
remarks m the voice that never fails to fetch ’em,
and cover her retreat with a promise to appear
again next year.

George Rignold the Great takes possession
of the Royal on Saturday, when the long-looked-
for “ Cheer, Boys, Cheer ” is to be set up with a
strong cast and much gorgeous scenery, likewise
a tender regard for necessary adjuncts and minute
details. George Rignold captured this big show
during his recent visit to London, and has been
working at its production like a giant refreshed by
ozone.

It is wired from Rockhampton to a Bris-
bane daily that “the Brough Comedy Co.’s visit
to Rockhampton is causing quite a sensation.
Special trains are coming from Longreach and
Clermont daily next week, and upward of 2000
seats have already been booked.” Longreach is
nearly 500 miles from Rockhampton.
At Poverty Point.
The unostentatious return of Emelie Melville with Nat
Goodwin’s co. was the sensation to Melbourneites. And
what a reception she got! She has come back as charm-
ing as ever, though, of course, less voluptuously so, and
as a comedienne is distinctly a success.
Emelie Melville’s return will re vive innumerable memories
of that operatic light of other days. During her prime,
the adorable little woman could never appear in the
streets without having a curious and admiring crowd

Arthur Garner’s wife joined him in New York early in
May, and they were to sail for Europe June 20, leaving
London for Sydney early in Sept. “To-night,” writes
Mr. Garner from N.Y. under date 24th May, “ we dine
with Herr and Mdme. Vogrich (Alice Rees), who are
settled here and doing well —the latter is looking wonder-
fully well and much improved since the old “Patience”
days. lam in negotiation with some very strong attrac-
tions for the Palace Theatre (“ Tattersall ” Adams’ new
Sydney hall), and shall be much disappointed if the new
venture does not turn out a very big success. By the
way, an uncontradicted statement has been made in the
S.M. Herald that Mr. Phil. Goatcher has been appointed
managing-director of the new Palace Theatre, so I have
written in for the scene-painter’s billet.”

Reuben Fax and Edith Crane don’t play much in the
same yard—if one may judge from the fact that the great

flowers passed over the floats for her during recalls.
Melbourne Age of Saturday last is rough on somebody—
“ Would that the same sentiment restrained the actors
and actresses of the present day from sidling on to the
footlights because a few employes of the house make a
noise to enable the alleged spontaneous tributes from the
florists’, paid for by some simpering Johnny, calculating
manager, or even by the fair artiste herself, to be pre-
sented in due form ! ”
Maggie Moore’s benefit at Melb. Royal provided an out-
let, this last week or so, for the furious enthusiasm of
Clifford Ferley, who represents her in front of the house.
Ferley never seems quite happy unless he is acting as
honorary secretary to a testimonial committee. That’s
the young man’s amiable vice. If he ever gets aloft he
will insist upon arranging a benefit for St. Peter, and the
authorities will receive a letter, signed C.F., inviting them
to purchase a bundle of tickets in consideration of the
archangel’s long and faithful services.
Mr. Harry Nathan, organist of St. Mary’s Church
Waverley (Sydney), has been appointed organist of the
Anglican Church at Charters Towers. Mr. Nathan was
one of Montague Younger’s most capable pupils and used
to act for him when necessary. He can sing as well as
play, and his rendering of Glover’s “Consider the Lilies,”
in which his manly baritone revels, is a musical treat.
Miss Edith O’King, a close relative of the well-known
Newcastle organist, hails from the N.S.W. Northern dis-
trict, and is just, now one of Sydney’s favorite sopranos.
She has done good work at St. Patrick’s Church under
the beneficent influence of Wiegand ; and, since Colborne-
Baber’s departure, has practically taken her position as
the principal local soprano.
Bellew and Potter during this Melbourne season put up
at Middle Park, and, taking-the air on the seashore as
they did daily, they were a spectacle for the gods. ’ La
Potter looked limp and eerie, with storm-tossed hair, and
wore eccentric garments suggesting the idea that Cora
had just escaped from a fire and was looking for someone
to button her up, and over all was an outre Bernhardtian
abandon that knocked the droves of bicyclists silly and
all the whirled wondered. Bellew, too, wore clothes’ that
never were on land or sea, and an assumed and interesting
pallor, and a quantity of grey hair becomingly dashed
back. The pair were sicklied o’er with the pale cast of
advt.., and, seeing them, one thought only of a mad
angular poster by. Aubrey Beardsley, inviting attention to
the fact that “ Camille ” was being played nightly—prices
as usual. 1

Managers of snide shows in Q. country towns often in-
troduce the names of popular Southern artiststinto their
programmes, and even go so far as to use the names of
pros, playing in the province. Last week W. Gourlay had
o insert an advt, in local papers that he would not
appear at a show for which his name had been billed
without his authority. The Frantz Family and Harry
Kickards may some day visit a far-northern town

kiocal editors often could give the game away, but it
would spoil orders for job-printing.
When Georgius Rignoldus Kex is galled beyond endur-

very long ago, Warner was reported alive in America, and
his son, a likeness on a reduced scale, is W. B. Warner,
the comique. Our friend, wiry little L. M'Gowan, used
often to be confounded with Bob M'Gowan, a big, fat

Wallace Brownlow has joined the digger-ranks at
Hannan’s. The local Athletic Club gave him a compli-
mentary social the other Sunday evening, at which the
handsome baritone sang no less than five songs.
The “Trilby” eight-night season at Adelaide Royal
beat all records. On four evenings every stall and circle
seat was reserved.
George Bryer, who longtime looked after things for his
relative Willie Edouin, at the Strand Theatre, London,
has been managing the Luella-Cosgrove show at Melbourne
Bijou. Bryer came to Australia last summer with a
few comedies and light musical pieces in his bag, but he
doesn’t seem to believe overmuch in the land of his birth,
and talks of getting back to London shortly. Willie
Edouin, at latest dates, was touring the English provinces
in a new musical comedy called “Newmarket.”
Brisbane lately had six shows all running at once :
“Trilby,” Brough’s, Holloway’s, English Concert Co.,
Fitzgeralds’ circus, and Speed’s variety show.
F. Barron Morley, the son of Fred. Morley, organist of
St. John’s Church, Darlinghurst, and nephew of the
eminent English composer of same surname, is one of the
most promising of young pianists. He is not unlike Mark
Hambourg in abruptness of style, and with his father’s
practical advice and assistance bids fair to make a name.
He will shortly tour Australia. Sydney Liedertafel has
already started to acknowledge the young artist’s excep-
tional abilities.
There’s something objectionable in the platform de-
meanor of at least two lady vocalists who appear at Mel-
bourne concerts when the Brasseys are about. They have
a habit of favoring His Ex. and co. with a private and
confidential bow of recognition, which suggests that they
are about to warble for the sole benefit of those exalted
acquaintances, and don’t care a button for the vulgar
herd. One of the ladies in particular takes a jaunty pose
on the platform, with her hands behind her back, tips a
liberal smile to her friends and relatives in the front seats,
and then proceeds to catch the eye of the Gov'nor’s party,
way up in the balcony. Having captured the vice-regal
optic, mdlle. jerks her head in an easy here-we-are-again
style, and trills her little lay. The vulgar herd feels as
though it were intruding on a “ sassiety At Home.”
Among concert-goers there is a growing feeling against
the stupid old custom of artists leaving the platform after
a song, when they might as well retire behind a screen,
and so save a lot of time in coming back to take “ re-
calls ” and encores. Neither is there any reason why the
accompanist shouldn’t stay at the piano, except during
the 10 minutes interval. Concerts are made almost in-
tolerable by waits between songs, more wait between the
song and the recall, and again between the recall and the
encore, which last wait is prolonged by an interval
between the return of the pianist to the piano, and the
arrival of the lady or gent who has “ yielded to the
wishes of her (or his) admirers.” The public are accus-
tomed to get their encores quickly in a grand opera per-
formance, and the foolery associated with second-rate
warbling of trumpery ballads makes them very tired.
Let some enterprising concert-manager advertise : “ No
running up and down stairs between numbers. Carriages
at 9.30,” and try the effect.
George Musgrove wanted to arrange vwh manager
Courtneidge for a production of “Djin-Djin” at Prince’s
Theatre, Manchester, next Xmas, but our old friend Rocco
was already committed to “Babes in the Wood,” for
which he has engaged a big company.
At some of the English theatres they serve two courses
of “ early door.” Say the performance starts at 7.30 p.m.
and the minimum price for pit seats is a “bob”—from
6.15 to 6.30 there is a half-crown “ early door,” and from
6.30 to 7.15 the charge is a florin. In the common event
of the'pit being filled a quarter of an hour before curtain-
rise the “ bob ” admission fee doesn’t get a look in.
Lohr will take Charles Godfrey on tour when he
leaves the Rickards company. Lohr’s latest idea is to
make a particular feature of the vocalist in “ Balaclava ”
and other “ military-sketch ” songs, appertaining to
“Deeds that won the Hempire,” and probably Charles
will travel with a lecturer in attendance.
Gordon’s scenery for “ A Gilded Fool ” was built before
the original American designs came to hand, and only
slightly altered to meet Nat Goodwin’s suggestions at the
eleventh hour. Goodwin found the Firm’s “ sets ” hand-
somer than the originals.
Nat Goodwin is the difference between an artist and a
Johnny Tooleyan comic lecturer.

Dowager Countess Fortescue, who died in

in various respects, and are almost certain to b©
contradictory of one another’s statements. Besides,
not one hundred people will buy three lives of
Parkes published in one year, or three books of

Governor Gormanston (Tas.) likes to shoot

The R.C. doctrine of Purgatory is in close
touch with the Theosophical theory of re-inoama-
tion. According to the priest a soul must work
out its own salvation in one purgatorial period,
and according to the old-new philosophy the same
thing is accomplished through a more or less long
series of earthly lives. Had Mrs. Besant been m
Melbourne a few weeks ago, when father Isaao
Moore delivered his denunciation of the tailao,
that Repentant Fat-men can comfortably fall
asleep in the Lord,” a luminous controversy upon
the rival merits of Purgatory and Re-incarnation
might have given a shake-up to Australian irre-
ligious thought. It is worth remarking that the
most bigoted Roman Oatholios and the most ad-
vanced agnostics agree in ridiculing the cardinal
doctrine of Protestantism, whereby a converted
murderer is adjudged capable of being hurled
straight to Abraham’s bosom by a jerk of Nosey
Bob’s lever.
That ‘ ‘ Barcoo rot ” has
its origin in splinters or dust
from certain scrubs getting into
scratches or slight sores has long
been suspected, but never pro-
ven. An interesting support of
this conjecture is that doctors
have recently noted amonjj
workers in teak timber a curi-
ous inflammation of the skin,
and named it “ teak-disease.
This inflammation followed by
suppuration has been expert
mentally shown to be caused
by small splinters piercing the
skin, or teak-dust setting on
abraded surfaces, such experi-
ments confirming the belief of
the teak - workers themselves.
“Barcoo rot ” might well be
similarly investigated.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Insolvent members are now sitting both in
N.S.W. Council and Assembly.
Hancock’s definition of Vic. Labor-party :
“ Pace-makers to the Turner Ministry.”
There is neither a Roman Catholic nor an
Irishman in the present N.S.W. Ministry. But
Premier Reid professes to dearly love Tipperary
Dan.
Viator: “Australian loyalty to England
is geographical. Like a pudding where the plums
sink to the bottom. Warmest in South Australia
Proper, coldest in South Australia Improper —Car-
pentaria!
There are within Sydney metropolitan
area 42 clubs retailing liquor and paying no license.
How will Local Option get at these? If Local
Option shut up 40 pubs., will not 40 additional
clubs take their places?
It may be right sometimes to crawl, and it
may be all right sometimes to fight; but mingled
fight and crawl is a sorry spectacle. The sight of
a minister of the crown being dragged around by
the boom-press with all the fight bumped out of
him is too despicable for words.
Thus the Argus, July 13 :
A fiscal system is not to be judged by either six weeks
or six months of its existence. Six years would be a
moderate term of experiment.
And then it whoops through a column about the
success of N.S.W. Freetrade for the last half-year.
Old-man Parkes seems to have kept every
letter he ever received, and amongst his corre-
spondence have been found epistles from several
N.S.W. Labor-members promising to support the
want-of-confidence resolution he moved against
Reid. Which letters may possibly make a public
appearance just before next general election.
How railway deficits are made. On aQ.
suburban line nearly 7000 stoppages are made to
pick up and set down about 950 passengers. Depart-
mental figures give the cost of stoppages at about
£3O, and fares .£6O, but the actual cost of stop-
pages seems to be about =£27o. A railway official
is said to own a hunk of land near the station.
In Sydney to-day over 2000 families, total-
ling about 10,000 human beings, are receiving
bread from the Benevolent Asylum each week.
Even then single men have to be refused in most
cases, in order that the married destitute with
children may be fed. No wonder the Benevolent
Asylum report has been suppressed for political
purposes.
The PuNCH-like attempts of the Anglo-
Australian daily press to be funny about the “ Boy
Orator of Nebraska’s ” nomination as U.S. Presi-
dent prove conclusively that the writers have never
heard of the clause in the U.S. Constitution which
debars “ boys ” from occupying the Presidential
chair until they have reached the fairly mature
age of 35.
Melb. Argus on the “ special audit” clause
in Vic. Companies Bill: —
The 37 members who were opposed to him (the Attorney-
General) yesterday are not conspirators. They include,
indeed, the pick of the Assembly for character and
capacity.
At any rate, they included Chimside, Madden,
and M‘Arthur!!!
Fink, M.L.A.
The list of public men in Victoria —men who had ad-
ministered the affairs of the country—did not contain the
names of many who had been brilliant successes in finan-
cial matters, whereas it did contain the names of many
who had met their downfall in business-concerns.
True. There are many roads to the Benevolent
Asylum, and politics is one of them.
H. : “ The Argus is sarcastic on an orator
who, at the Orange-Catholic fight, urged both
sides to drop their nonsense, and join in belting
the monopolist. This is what every newspaper
man knows to be wisdom, but, as Hamlet says, he
does not think it wisdom to be here set down.
While the Uganda niggers fight, as Orangemen
and Catholics, ‘Me Prostan, you Catlick! ’ it
would be unfair not to keep up the balance at this
end of the globe.”
M‘Farlane, M.L.A., has before N.S.W.
Assembly a Bill for the abolition of usury. It
provides that no interest, bonus, or other consider-
ation for money lent shall be lawful if it exceeds
15 per cent. But it doesn’t say as definitely as it
should whether, supposing a man lends £lOO at
40 per cent., and can’t recover his interest privately
through his client’s fear of exposure, he can then
sue for his principal and 15 per cent., or whether
the fact that he has broken the statute makes his
principal and interest both wholly irrecoverable.
Tasmanian Parliament retains the old
joke about introducing a bill. The member
appears at the bar of the House, flourishes a bit
of the Mercury rolled up, or one of Tattersall’s
hand-bills, and yells out, “A bill, Mr. Speaker.”
The Speaker says, “ Bring it up,” and the mem-
ber does, and hands it to the clerk of the House,
who drops it into the W.P.B. The second read-
ing is made an order of the day for that day
week. One day the late clerk, Mr. Manning,
found that “ the bill ” was a butcher’s account be-
ginning, “p. saus., 31b.”
The Maoriland Oppositionists are in a
parlous state. Every day their chances of
ousting Se 4don grow more remote; every
day their tactics become more desperate.
THE RIGHT TIME TO SWEAR OFF.
PARSON : “ When will up the cursed drink?"
TOPER : “ When I can’t (hie) help meself."
They are now stealing the Govt, policy to
make their own platform. They are like their
fellow favorites, who come to a digging after
the Caucasian has deserted it, and make a living
by working over the tailings. Their big gun,
Stout, resembles nothing so much as the geological
phenomenon known as a trapdyke, a spurt of old
lava running at right angles to the line of the
strata. Trapdyke Stout!
After a year’s continuous demands by
Parliament, and three promises that it should be
produced “immediately,” the list of the Reid
Government’s civil service appointments turned
up the other day. The figures show that the
God-fearing and retrenching Ministry made 733
appointments in about 18 months—almost as many
as their predecessors made in three years. And
yet who doesn’t remember the fearsome howl of
THE RUMINATING ANIMAL.
“ Oh, mamma, can I have some more?"
“ There is no more, dear."
“ Oh, mamma, I DO wish I was a cow so that I could chew it all over again."
G. Reid over those Dibbs appointments ? One of
the earliest appointments is said to be Mr. Reid’s
own sister-in-law. App’int Mrs. Maloney.
This year Vic. Leg. Council passed the
Shops and Factories Bill—rejeoted last session—
almost without a murmur. Also, it almost looks
as if the Companies Bill might get through as well
which would be still more surprising-. Apparently
Turner’s policy of saying nothing about the Coun-
cil’s rejection of his measures but peacefully send-
ing them up again and again without comment
and leaving the old men to talk each other to
death over them, is beginning to act. Also
Solicitor-General Cuthbert grovels so beautifully
to the M.’sL.C. that even they get mollified at
times.
The Vic. Government has introduced an
Insolvency Bill, which abolishes the secret-com-
position curse, and the private trustee who gener-
ally bolts with the assets, and most of the other
bad features of the old law. The Turner Ministry
is putting up a good record by tackling the big
questions which its predecessors have shirked for
the last 25 years, and it does its work without
banquets and progresses through the country and
blowing of the big, brass trumpet of advt. If it
lasts four years longer it should about manage to
make Victoria an up-to-date Democratic country.
And by then it will probably begin to wear beauti-
ful towels on its boots and be made a K.C.M.G.
and it will be high time for it to go.
Although 45 years ago N.S. Wales sent to
England a protest specifying among other points
“ that all offices of trust should be conferred on
colonists, except that of Governor,” Deputy
Mint-Master J. Macdonald Cameron, who figured
the other day among the Burns enthusiasts,
was nominated and appointed by England, with-
out any consultation with N.S. Wales, and is paid
monthly by N.S.W. taxpayers.
Brisbane is making desperate
efforts to emulate Sydney and be*
come the port, par excellence, of its
province. It is a mournful but
indisputable fact that poor old
Rockhampton, with its dreadful
sewer of a river, actually beats
Brisbane in the matter of exports,
and Townsville, for all its lighter-
ing, is very little behind. Mean-
while, the true ports of Bananaland,
Gladstone and Bowen and Cairns,
are patiently waiting till the
ancient log-rollers step aside and
give them a chance.
Cabled that “ the French
Chamber of Deputies has rejected
the income-tax proposals intro-
duced by the Radicals by 29 votes.”
Once again France stands out
against a tax which even monarchi-
cal countries have adopted, and
which is accepted by ultra-Liberal
and Liberal economists generally
as a valuable instrument for the
equitable apportionment of State
burdens. But it is historical sen-
timent and not economic science
which in this matter appears to
dominate France. The National
Assembly of 1789, under the sway
of La Rochefoucauld and Talley-
rand, laid it down that “every
system of taxation which necessi-
tates personal and arbitrary inquisi-
tions for its execution is inconsis-
tent with the maintenance of a free
people.” This is identical with the
Australian argument against in-
come-tax. But when France carried
the proposition the tax had become
an inordinately vexatious extor-
tion, and it is possibly a remem-
brance of this extortion which
keeps the proposition alive.
Premier Reid certainly takes a very opti-
mistic view of things if he imagines, as stated in
his budget speech, that the first year’s cost of in-
augurating and collecting N.S. W. land and income
tax will be under 10 per cent., and that the annual
cost will be from 3to 4. Taking the experience of
other places, it may be safely said that 20 per cent,
will be nearer the mark for the first year, and the
annual cost thereafter will be fully 7 per cent. By
the way, do the land and income tax commis-
sioners make any allowance to the postal dept, for
having their letters and papers franked through
the post ?
On Thursday of last week, Premier Reid’S
list of prices of .N.S.W. and Vic. Government
stores was duly circulated in print. Considering
that the said list had been proved several days
previously to be a lie and a delusion, and G. Reid
had already shunted the blame of it on to the
Govt stores official, and that person had acknow-
ledged that lie had somehow taken a wrong list
and that his facts were consequently all out, any
politician with a conscience might have been
expected to suppress the document—or at least
attempt to do so. The idea of calmly putting the
exploded Ananias into circulation as if it! was
something quite good and new looks unique.
Stout, of Maoriland, has a Bill in hand
providing that no person shall have power to will
more than one-third of his or her property away
from the widow or widower and children of the
deceased. This will knock the stuffing out of a
good many of those church bequests, by which the
dying reprobate tries to effect a big fire-insurance
on his soul at the expense of his family. Every-
body has met the huge marble tombstone of that
deceased benefactor who hung on to his money
with teeth and claws, and enjoyed it all his life
and when he was quite done with it piously
sacrificed his family in the good cause, and left
most of the pile to “ charity.” The Bulletin has
always yearned to kick that cheap benefactor.
According to Premier Reid, “ it is not an
argument to say that Protection has been (and is)
the policy of many nations.” It is not an argu-
ment in fa/vor of personal cleanliness to say that
Premier Reid washes himself. Thousands of
people are indisposed to wash themselves, and if
they were all massed together in one nation, their
national policy would be soapless. Yet the fact
of P.R. preferring to keep himself clean is the
best practical proof of his disbelief in dirt that he
can show. And proofs are the nearest approaches
to argument that one can get. Freetraders are
outnumbered by Protectionists to about the same
extent that the absolutely dirt-encrusted people
are outnumbered by cleaner people. This is not
quite an argument, but very near it.
The M.L. Postal Department is being
vigorously canvassed for subscriptions to a Ward
testimonial. The movement was started by some
of the boss officials, so the miserable underling is
made to distinctly understand that his bosses look
favorably on the scheme, which practically means
that they will look unfavorably on the man who
doesn’t support it. Also, Seddon approved of the
movement in Parliament, therefore the vast
shadow of Digger Dick falls on the man who
doesn’t pay up. So the ill-paid postal official is
terrorised and blackmailed into giving his money
and his enthusiastic sympathy to the busted specu-
lator of Invercargill, and Richard of Kumaramakes
another big mistake through not knowing when
to throw his Jonah overboard.
F. C. Gray, M.L.A. for Prahran (Vic.), on
Federation:—
Respecting the question of Federation, I ask the publio
to exercise the greatest care in selecting men of judg-
ment, honor, and ability as its delegates to the forthcom-
ing conference.
Men, in fact, who have not —to use his own
immortal phrase—“ wives in every suburb.” If
the Vic. public has any sense, and such politicians
really exist, it will enthusiastically elect them as
delegates. They are, though sinners, at least men,
with enough red blood in their veins to feed their
brains, whereas politicians of the Gray type are
merely colorless agglomerations of human veal
whose vital force is composed of white corpuscles
and watery serum, out of which nothing good or
bad ever did or could or can come.
The Aveak point of the Yic. Factories Bill
is that it leaves out the laundries worked in con-
nection with “charitable institutions.” The
private steam-laundry must be registered, must
work its employes only certain hours or else pay
overtime, and must have a certificated engine-
driver in charge of its machinery. The charitable
one is exempt, therefore it can work its sweated
employes any hours ; it doesn’t pay overtime—in
fact, it often pays no wages at all, but takes in the
poor and suffering and oppressed in the sacred
name of benevolence, and works them 10 or 12
hours per diem in return for food and clothes and
a hard bed, and much pious exhortation. And for
some wholly unaccountable reason it isn’t com-
pelled to have a qualified engineer, so it may
wreck half-a-street when its mismanaged boiler
goes ker-smash, and scald all the neighborhood
with impunity.
The Yic. Government has produced its
Bill for the regulation of the export-trade. It
provides in the most definite manner possible
that no live-stock, meat, fruit, or dairy produce
shall be exported to any country outside Austra-
lasia unless it has been inspected by a State
official and passed as thoroughly sound. This is
about the roughest thing that ever happened to
the “liberty of the subject,” but it has been found
that the men who send to England damaged pro-
duce of any kind not only get low prices them-
selves but bring down prices all round; one big
consignment of bad butter, for instance; can make
all Victorian butter almost a drug in the market
for weeks afterwards. Therefore, the liberty of
the subject goes under once more in the interests
of the majority. One quaint clause in the Bill
provides that the Agricultural Department may
“declare any spot to be a cool store within the
meaning of the Act.” What’s the matter with
declaring Gehenna to a cool store ?
The life of John Donaldson since 1890 is
the awful moral of what may happen to the
Queenslander who defies M £ ll wraith and the
Q.N. Bank; his death is the point. As Treasurer
to the Morehead Ministry Donaldson brought
down one of the most Democratic budgets seen in
Australia. Its feature was a thumping property-
tax which gave Q.N.B. Manager Drury a fit. All
the overdrafters, and landlords, and mortgagees
started to ring the tocsin, and sulky MTlwraith
came back and gulled the electors, as usual.
Fat-Man took a dire vengeance on his pre-
sumptuous assailant. Donaldson was driven out
of politics and harassed into insolvency ; and
the man who died the other day was only a wreck
of his old self. Latterly, broken in purse and
spirit, he compromised with the enemy, and was
glad to be permitted to take the Logan seat as a
Govt, supporter. Donaldson was an Australian
native, and an honest, straightforward, manly
felloAv whom chicanery found an easy victim.
Crick, M.P., has a comprehensive Bill before
the N.S.W. Assembly, for abolishing the port-
folios of Attorney-General and Postmaster-Gene-
ral ; and for creating a Department of Industry;
and to define, in certain cases, the duties of certain
Ministers. The last idea is so complicated that it
will probably kill the other two. What is wanted
is a measure to make the P.M.G. a permanent,
non-political official, on a purely business basis,
like the Commissioner of Railways ; and to make
the Attorney-General a permanent legal adviser
outside Parliament and the Ministry. Then the
best available lawyer can be appointed, instead of
only the best available lawyer in Parliament on
the Government side of the House, who can spare
time from his private practice—or from his fishing-
excursion. And, being out of Parliament and out
of politics, he will be able to do his duties in a
calm, judicial spirit, which can’t be expected
when Crick and Meagher, and other politicians,
are yelling in his ear and calling him all kinds of
animals.

What a choice collection of smells there is
in Smelb. just at present! Chaffey’s Mildewra,
Eergusonia Longmuiriatica, and the Telephonic
asafoetida. And all in a week !
Notice stuck up in Westralian diggings
butcher’s shop“ Residents are respectfully re-
quested not to interfere or tamper with my colored
shepherdesses, others not working being avail-
able.” There are over 100 white men and only six
white women in that camp.
Miss Batten, the Kilmore (Vic.) postmis-
tress charged with forgery and embezzlement, wasn’t
let loose on light bail, like lawyer Geake. Bail
for the unhappy woman was fixed at exactly
£lOOO more than Geake’s, and she went to prison
upon being committed for trial. One law for
women, another for lawyers.
A Melb. District Court case last week sug-
gests what may be the outcome of that which Miss
Watt-Tanner, in “ The Amazons,” calls a season’s
hunting, in the familiar Saturday afternoon waltzes
in the woodlands, by church choirs, varied by
kiss-in-the-ring. Complainant, described as a
prominent member of a Church of England choir,
got a verdict for the maintenance of her “fine
chubby ” child, by defendant, whilom the church-
organist, a married man.
Two Yankee physicians have devised an
ingenious instrument known as the Eell-O’Dwyer
Artificial Respiration Apparatus, for use in cases
of opium-poisoning. The symptoms after such
poisoning are hard, stertorous respiration, followed
by deep coma, with cyanosis or “blue ing” of the
skin. The apparatus consists practically of an
ordinary spring bellows, worked by the foot, which
drives air in regular spirts into the lungs. In one
bad case it took 2f hours from coma setting in to
counteract its effect. Another opium-case took an
hour. Records prove that, while practically use-
less in coma supervening on cerebral hemorrhage,
it is an almost certain remedy in all cases of
coma due to poisoning by opium preparations.
Such apparatus could be extemporised from an
ordinary kitchen-bellows connected to a rubber
tube, which could be pushed well back into the
mouth.
About the most sensible thing in connec-
tion with the recent Brunswick {Melb.) Orange-
trouble was the remark made by Crown-Prosecutor
Smith, in the subsequent legal proceedings. He
said his father was a Mason, and he had had
enough family experience of the Masonic society
to make him abstain from belonging to any
society holding its meetings in secret. He did
not even join the A.N.A., regarding them as
being as bad as Orangemen. Now the A.N. A. is
after Smith’s scalp, and the Orangemen are up in
arms over the insulting comparison.
Meagher, to the electors of Phillip at his
meeting last week, said “he hoped again, some
day, to be of service to the land that gave him
birth. ” What, again ?
There has been no vice-regal infant born
at Govt. House, Brisbane, till the youthful and,
at present, exceedingly ruddy Master Baillie-
Cochrane appeared last week, since Lady Bowen
added a son and two daughters to the population.
A Maoriland and a Portland (Vic.) clergy-
man agreed to a twelvemonths’ exchange of pul-
pits. Three months of the time has expired, and
each shepherd wishes to return to his own parti-
cular flock. Neither parson can collect any money
in his new vineyard. “ A bad deal,” one of them
remarks.

A crop of libel-actions, as anticipated by
The Bulletin, is about to issue from the Anglo-
Franco-Westralian mining case, heard in Mel-
bourne the other week. Cayron claims £5OOO
damages, for alleged slander, from Dr. Crivelli,
a local sassiety medico ; also, a like amount from
Adolphe Russell, defendant in the mining-suit,
and £lOOO from Jules Borgels, watchmaker.
Meantime, the English syndicate which did such
unsatisfactory business with the Russell faction,
through Cayron aforesaid, is carrying its case
to the Privy Council, and seems certain to starve
the impoverished Frenchmen into capitulation.
At present Russell is clinging to the mine in dis-
pute, without having refunded some £l2OO of
English purchase-money, paid on a contract which
he repudiates. This doesn’t prove a legitimate
sale, but it goes towards supporting a statement
that Judge Hodges, who presided over the case of
the Liberty and Alliance Co.’s v. Russell, failed to
understand it. No outsider could understand it
thoroughly, and a Judge is only a learned out-
sider, after all.
In Adelaide, holy Adelaide, a petition with
20,000 signatures upon it was recently presented to
Parliament demanding that public-houses should
be opened on the Day of Rust.
Melb. Herald : “ The peculiar theory has
lately been propounded that all persons who par-
take to any extent of malt drinks have large feet.
The Herald man must have been very upset in-
deed when he measured his head under the im-
pression that he was taking the dimensions of his
feet.
A novel mouse-trap was discovered, the
other day, by a Melb. man, who, when putting
some fresh oysters into his pantry, dropped one on
the floor and omitted to pick it up. Feeling the
air stuffy in the night, the bivalve gaped his shell
for more, whereon three prowling mice inserted
their paws. Oyster gripped them, and kept them
prisoners for the cat.
Dear Bulletin, —Do you think N.S.W.
Govt, could be induced to distribute, among
shearers, drovers, prospectors, travellers, and
others, a few pounds each of imported grass-seeds,
such as rye, prairie-grass, &c. ? Bushmen would
be only too glad to carry and scatter it along the
numerous barren tracks of the interior. — Cooee.
[Dunno ; is grass-seed saleable at a shanty ?
Ed. B.]
An excellent bush-telephone can be made
from the top wire of a fence, good enough to carry
over 25 miles. At straining-posts, a small wire
should be wound closely round the wires on each
side of the post. Gates are overcome by attaching
poles to the gate-posts, and carrying a small wire
across from the fence wires. The mouth and ear
pieces are the usual ones. Of course, in wet
weather the telephone cannot work as well as in a
dry time.
Melb. detective force is arranging a testi-
monial and smoke-night send-off for burly John
Coleman, who retires from the service on his
Eension at the end of the month. Coleman, who
asn’t been a sufficiently prominent thief-catcher
to excite anybody’s jealousy, is popular among the
d’s because he dignifies their calling with his broad
commercial aspect, and can sing a jolly good song.
He’s the plump tenor of the crowd.
Northern Queensland experience seems to
show that the tick is only formidable in coastal
districts. On the Western plains and downs the
exposure to winter-cold and summer-heat seems to
be unfavorable to rapid spread and increase.
Many native birds, particularly the ibis, are very
fond of the insects as food. So rapidly does the
scourge advance southwards that the Bananaland
Parliament needs to revise its tick-legislation every
fortnight.
King O’Malley, of S.A., the wild-eyed
canvasser who has just got into Parliament,
says that the employment of barmaids is “be-
spattering with mud the loving, moon-eyed goddess
of Democracy.” O’Malley’s figures of speech
have a warm fleshiness about them, and a rich,
fruity, soulful hugginess, and a poetic sentiment
of “ the altogether.” Even when discussing the
finances of a road-board his language is that of a
man who is embracing a lovely woman ap lie talks,
and is troubled through her ambrosial fringe
getting into his mouth.
Editor Bulletin, —Apropos your recent
par. on Melb. medical-clubs, let me, as one who
knows the subject, enlighten the public by a few
facts from actual experience. To begin with, al-
though (id. weekly for attendance and medicine is
low enough for anything, the average rate paid
for attendance only by the friendly societies is
only 3d. weekly, and their cost for medicine, it
may be safely said, does not exceed Id. weekly.
Even allowing for cost of canvassing and collect-
ing, this leaves a small margin in favor of the
private club. True, again, that the latter will
take the man at =£s weekly and the navvy at ss. a
day ; but it will not, like the friendly society, take
the well-to-do publican or lawyer or estate-agent
or storekeeper or the retired squatter or the civil-
servant at <£looo a year, members of all of which
classes (and I speak by the card) are -bene-
fiting greatly by the 3d.-a-week arrangement.
Eurther, the arrogance, the injustice, and
the utter want of consideration shown by
most friendly societies towards their medical
officers have driven many of them to seek
any loophole of escape from what is, in many
cases, an intolerable position. The opinions uni-
versally expressed as to friendly societies by
medicos, when only medicos are present, do not
vary throughout Australia. (In Melbourne they
are only a little more violent than usual.) The
private club has this further advantage, that the
subscriber can, in cases of incompetence or neglect,
change his doctor without forfeiting any other
privileges; while the doctor can eject an
obnoxious member without quarrelling with
a powerful and generally spiteful secret
society. As to the allegation of incapacity
to do the work properly for the sum mentioned, I
find that, for a busy month, the average number
of patients seen is at the rate of six a day for every
100 members that is, a lodge numbering 1000
members, and bringing in a fair income, would
involve seeing 60 patients a day. Fair work, but
nothing overwhelming, for it must be remembered
that the majority of cases are quite trivial—in fact,
many men in good practice daily see twice that
number. The medico with the private lodge
can only slouch his work or be ignorant of it at
the expense of losing it altogether—members are
not easy to get and very easy to lose ; and he can-
not square any friendly Nob’e Grand or arch
Buffalo or boss Forester to keep the rest of the
flock in order. It is pretty cutthroat work in
Melb., but it is certainly a case of the survival of
the fittest. Apart from all this, the private medi-
cal lodge is doing good work, for there are thou-
sands in this destitute city who cannot afford
more than 6d. a week (the friendly society’s total
subscription is from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d.), and there
are thousands more (single women and men of a
certain age) who are not , eligible for friendly
societies. —G.D.

Dear Bulletin, —Be the “ gibba ” quartz-
crystal found in an aboriginal “ bora ” cemetery.
During a flood on the Macleay River a stray abo-
riginal youth, making his way to the main camp
situated on the high land, swam the river naked
and was found by a friend of mine dangling from
a gum-stump by his toes —quite dead. He had
on him a tin match-box in vogue in the sixties ; it
measured about Gin. long, and inside it was a
smaller one which, in its turn, enclosed another.
The crystal, about the size of a pumpkin-seed,
was contained in this last and wrapped in rag.
The blacks came when the flood had subsided, and
searched closely ; also inquired for the talisman ;
but my friend, was afraid to give it up, for if a
woman keeps this “mundi mundi,” as it is called,
she is killed with the tomahawk. By the way, in
the Awaba dialect of Port Macquarie “ bora
ground is “capera” ground, the place of rites,
burial, and battle.— Dulcangi.
Over two cartloads of mussels were re-
moved from the bottom of a barque docked at
Wellington (M.L.) recently. Which recalls the
fact that mussels were unknown in Port -rlump
until the docking or beaching of an English vessel
at Sandridge in the early days. The molluscs, as
they were scraped off the vessel, dropped into the
bay, and became the progenitors of the countless
tons of mussels which rot, during summer, upon
the foreshores of St Kilda and Albert Park.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“ Monico ” writes to The Bulletin from Lon-
don :—“The collapse against the M.C.C. and Ground
was too overwhelming to be painful at the time, and
Darling’s dour determined stand next day was badly
wanted to save Australians’ prestige for pluck from
obliteration. The Adelaide man, with his left leg behind
his bat to stop breaking balls he missed, refused to he
hurried by wicket-eager bowers. Over and over again
the trundier had to turn back in his preliminary whilst
the batsman calmly mopped his brow, carefully took up
his position, and grimly tried to avert the one-innings
defeat. And the crowd was with him, too. Applause
follow d every score, and his reception at the close
almost approached an ovation. Had Giffen but gone in
to keep up one end—if a man can lounge about the
wickets he can stand at the wickets—the result might
have been slightly different. At present the less said
about Giff. and other matters the better. The opinion of
Bill Murdoch, whose persuasiveness availed not, would be
valuable—and vigorous.
“For the first time in Ehgland Eady batted
with confidence—after the opening overs—and on an im-
proving wicket, against J. T. Ilearne, Pougher, Davidson,
Grace, and Jackson, made his highest score up to date.
The Tasmanian is a raw colt, and after placing a ball in
the long-slips stood half-way up the pitch to see if it were
fielded. ‘ Run ! ’ roared Darling ; and the giant got home
and spread himself in a broad, boyish smile. When the
Englishmen were batting-, ‘ long-off ’ was missing at the
opening of an over, and discovered, still at ‘ deep square-
leg,’ absorbed in thoughts of Raspberry Land and hitting
Windsor for ‘ sixes.’
“Gregory, with an average of 41, is batting
pluckily and consistently ; Darling and Trott with not too
much luck ; Giffen, Donnan, and Hill should do better ;
Graham throws his wicket away; Iredale seldom has it to
throw away ; Eady rapidly improving ; Trumble surpris-
ing the scorners; Kelly doing doggedly; and Jones,
Johns, and M Tib bin not attempting to upset expecta-
tions.”
* * * *
An Australian abroad gossips to The Bulle-
tin : —“ Old IC. M. Grace, now 52, has rarely played county
cricket of late, and it was only as a last resort'that he was
included for Gloucester against the Australians. The
doctor (for, like ‘ W.G.,’ he practises medicine in his spare
moments) still plays a lot of cricket, however, as captain
of the local club, and there he rules the roast. On one
occasion he was given ‘out’ l.b.w. by the umpire. He
protested : ‘ Nonsense, I was not out.’ 1 No,’ replied the
umpire, ‘not out, the doctor knows best’ —and E.M.
stopped where he was.
“ It will be a pity if such matches as the Aus-
tralian XI. have played at Wembley Park and the Crystal
Palace are allowed to find a place on every programme.
‘ An Eleven of England’ is such a vague, unrepresenta-
tive combination, as a rule, that nobody cares how the
result goes, and the games are only arranged to give
amusement-managers a chance of a cut in at a good spec.
The fact that both of the above-named matches must
have meant a loss to the speculators who gave the Aus-
tralians a £250 guarantee, is not to be deplored.
“ The Lord’s crowd howled with delight and
derision as the Australians went down one after the other
before the M.C.C. In comparison with those howls the
dead silence amidst which the previous victories had been
won seemed, on reflection, almost abject.
“ Commenting on the opinions of the press that
‘ funk ’ was responsible for the score of 18 Australia made
against M.C.C., Trumble remarked, ‘ All I have to say is
what Bonnor said years ago under similar circumstances :
* The ball that bowled me would have bowled the Creator,
and there was no funk.’
“The stand made by Darling and Eady in the
Australians’ second innings against the M.C.C. was most
interesting, as with Giffen ill and M'Kibbin only to come
in, it was the last chance of saving an ignominious defeat.
At the same time, the play was of the slowest. During
40min. only two runs were made, and Eady did not break
his duck until he had been at the wicket over half-an
hour. Before each ball he received Darling would take
an extraordinary time bracing himself up, patting the
turf, and finally settling himself to bat.
“ To be dependent on Eady to save a match is a
most anxious time, for he swings his bat in such wild
fashion before each stroke that it looks anv odds against
his eventually getting on to the ball. You never feel he’s
really set.
“J. T. Hearne, who bowled so well for the
M.C.C. against Australia and got all the wickets in their
second innings, is undoubtedly, on his present form, about
the best bowler in England. Pougher, on the other hand,
who did such sensational work in the same match, though
a good bowler is not great, and would certainly not be in-
cluded in an All-England eleven unless great weight is
given to his performance on this particular occasion.
Richardson is very in-and-out, and is either very effective
or very expensive, according to the ground.
“ Taken as a whole, the cricket-grounds of
England are badly-managed. The catering is almost in-
variably of the worst description. The scoring-boards are
most primitive, even at Lord’s. The public are allowed,
nearly everywhere, to encroach upon the playing-ground
—sometimes to the extent of 20yds., and invariably four
or five, and at some places the batsmen have to push their
way through the crowd as they go to and from the
wickets.
“ Few Australian cricketers would know Iredale
for the same man if they saw him batting in England and
had no previous experience of his play but the brilliance
of his performances in his own country. It is only now
and again that one of his strokes even resembles Sydney
form. At the beginning of the tour he was excused on
the ground of strangeness to English wickets ; now it
seems to be faint-heartedness only.”
But there has been no faint-heartedness about
Iredale’s latest innings.
* * * *
“The Australians, who batted first, began
badly,” and “The Australians went first to the wickets”
(Argus and Age reports of the M.O.C. match). If this
had been Trott’s seventh successive time of losing the
toss, instead of winning it, the point would have ob-
truded itself considerably. As for example : “ The extra-
ordinary bad luck of the Australians still pursued them,
and the choice of innings fell to their opponents, as
usual.” Up to then Trott’s two-headed bob, or whatever
the talisman may be, had taken 18 tosses out of 22. He
started the tour with a sequence of six wins, against
which the odds were 50 to 1, or thereabouts, and has
beaten that record since.
* * * *
Strange that the Australians should make a
disastrous beginning in each of their first three matches
at Lord’s. They must have suffered from over-anxiety to
astonish the cockneys.
* * * *
Hulme, the Derbyshire bowler, was no more
good against the Australians when, the novelty had worn
off his attack. He took their wickets freely the first time
they met him ; next time he didn’t trouble them much ;
the third time, which was last week, he was seemingly as
easy as falling off a log.

A Cockney cricket-reporter dubbed Iredale “the

M.C.C. and Ground means the “amateur”

Ed. Bulletin,— Why not .call the last test-
match, not England v. Australia, but “ Australia v. Europe

* * * *
The Age did not post up the final result of the
second test-match on Sunday ; but the Argus was honest
enough to admit that it works on Sunday, and stuck up
the full scores as soon as they came through, and, more-
over, left them up all the evening for the church-goers to
see.
* * * *
It is not impossible that Giffen will, after all,
come out with the best Australian batting average.
Gregory, Iredale, and Qo. have meteoric flashes, but
George pegs along all the time, never going below fourth
on the list. He has not come with his big score yet.
* * * *
M.C.C. was deprived of a victory by the play-
for-time policy of Trott and Co. ; still the Australians are
entitled to the credit of achieving 331 runs in their
second innings. They made a fair bid for a “ draw,” and
got it, as they did at Sheffield Park in their first match.
But showing the difference between the two schools of
batting—on the second day M.C.C. scored 181 before
lunch, and on the third day the Australians stuck at the
wickets until five o’clock for 218. In fact, they had alto-
gether about twice as much time at the wickets as the
Englishmen were able to get, and only made 68 more
runs. C’est la guerre, mats ce n’est pas magnifique.
Iredale and Giffen together may be credited with
about 50 per cent, of the Australian victory in several
recent matches.
» * * *
The first turn days’ play in a Sussex v. Somerset
match produced 924 runs.
* * * - *
The selection of the nest All-England Eleven
will, no doubt, be considerably influenced by the form
which M.C.C. and Surrey professionals have shown against
the Australians. Anyway, M‘Laren, always a patchy per-
former, and Briggs, if not Stoddart or Jackson likewise,
may have to stand aside in favor of three bowlers who can
bat a bit, whilst Pougher may take the place of J. T.
Hearne. Peel is a probable choice on account of the
veteran left-hander recovering some of his old skill with
the ball. But it seems impossible for All-England to raise
a formidable bowling team that shall not have a weak
batting tail. And the main hope of any selection would
be Richardson. If that important item happens to be out
of sorts, the Britishers-cum-Ranji will be shorn of half
their strength.
* * * *
In age and weight, the All-England lot can still
do the Australians, although the young and scraggy
Indian Prince detracts from their supremacy in both par-
ticulars.
* * * *
Re the third and final test-match. With a good
wicket to start upon the All-England eleven are verj r
likely to win easily if they get first whack at the ball,
whereas the Australians are not likely to have much to
spare if they win the toss, unless the' weather works in
their favor. With a bad wicket throughout the match
the Australians arc very likely to win, whichever way the
luck of the toss may go. No Australian team has been
beaten by All-England in bowlers’ weather, nor had any
A.E. combination been licked on their own ground in
batsmen’s weather, until the other Saturday. And then
they weren’t licked much. Only two of them were clean
bowled, as against five Australians. Two of them (in-
cluding the “crack,” Jackson) got run out, whereas none
of our men threw away their chance of scoring. Poor old
Grace fell over in attempting to swipe one of Trott’s
slows, and was ignominious; y stumped. The awful failure
of all their bowlers, bar Richardson, put them almost
beyond the possibility of winning. They batted rashly,
had bad luck, yet they were only beaten by three wickets.
For the Australians, it is contended that Jones wasn’t
able to bowl his best, but considering the form shown by
M'Kibbin it seems doubtful whether Jones’ breakdown
wasn’t a gain instead of a loss. They can’t all be bowling
at once. M'Kibbin was picked as Jones’ understudy,
and when called upon to act in place of the Adelaide man
he did exceptionally well.

Dear B.—The Bulletin, strangely enough, is
the only Australian paper I know that displays a British
bias in its comments on international cricket. It has an
astonishing weakness for explaining away Australian
victories, and pointing out how different it might have
been if something had happened that neglected to occur,
or if somebody were on the job who was dead or unavoid-
ably detained. For this reason The Bulletin should be
interested in my three Englishmen. The first was a tram-
conductor with a Yorkshire flavor. On the Sunday on
which the finals of the second test-match came through
I asked him for the very latest. “ The Englishmen have
lost it,” he said. “ They can win when they like, you
know, but they must have had a bit on.” The other true
Britons I met during the afternoon, and each assured me
on his honor as a gentleman that the All-England Eleven
had sold the match. Here is patriotism in its noblest
form! The Britisher says: “Think us rogues if
you like, but don’t imagine for a moment that you can
beat us at cricket.” For my part I know that the three
matches the present Australian Eleven have lost were
sold in the open market to the highest bidder.—Yours
Australian Blow.

What with ten falls, the death of Dungan, in-

no end of sport at Moonee Valley Saturday. Waterloo

From Melb. Age’s account of Galway’s sensa-

hats went up, and in the vice-regal box Lord Brassey and

outpaced him in the G.N. Hurdle Race at Flemington, the
light-weight, being equal to big jumps, should beat most
of the older stagers for the four-mile race—that’s about as
certain as anything can be in racing argument. Also,
leaving the aforesaid defeat of Dungan out of the ques-
tion, Zouroff is a tempting chance, for the Hurdle Race
at Caulfield next Saturday, Tub Bulletin is disposed to
fancy Artist, though not with much enthusiasm. Mr.
Miller’s horse is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as to
whether he would have finished near the front at Flem-
ington under luckier circumstances, and anyone who
backed Artist for the race in whicli he came to grief might
as well go for a recovery of the lost boodle by trusting
the same animal this time. At any rate Artist has won

The travelling Q. team walked over Sydney’s
Rugby corpse in Saturday’s interprovincial leather-argu-
ment. The visitors were too fast and clever for the locals
and there was no luck about their 18 to 7 win. Short
passes were a prominent feature, and the occasional
monopoly of the ball in this respect really decided the
game. Also, the Q. backs were stubborn and sure, and
wing-forwards were discarded. This gave an additional
man to the scrum. Sydney had “ wings,” but they were
promptly clipped every time.

every point in Maoriland, bar perhaps Taranaki. The un-

Saturday’s Melb. football-matches, so far the
most interesting of the season, left the Premiership posi-
tions undisturbed. Essendon’s lOg. to 3g. against Foots-
cray were mainly got by systematic forward rushes.
Croft, a junior recruit, was responsible for three goals
besides a fine game. Collingwood and S. Melb. each woni
their matches. Melb. beat Carlton 7 to 3, and Fitzroy
Port Melb. Sensational St. Kilda played another brilliant,
game against Geelong, winning for the fifth year in suc-
cession by 7g. to sg. August will probably decide the
Premiership, as the leading clubs, Essendon, Collingwood
South Melb., Melb., and Fitzroy, meet one another. ’
* * * *
The case of umpire-stoushing at North Mel-
bourne last Saturday is another nail in the coffin of Vic-
torian football, regarded as a game for respectable patron-
age. Blackguardism grows more demonstrative as the
general public begins to stay away, and in accordance
with the eternal fitness of things the rorty Collingwood
team will probably win the blanky futball championship
for the blanky season. Let them win and wear it ever-
more.

Gov. Brassey—or was it the N.S.W. potentate ?

scale in favor of Collingwood versus “Noreth,” or
“ Sowth,” or the other way, is a terrible thing for an un-
armed person to deal with.

cap from scratch in Brisbane, is a 19-year old, 9st.
youngster of thin build, and, like the great Zimmy, is an
astounding “ take-down.” Seen for the first time Turner’s
clumsy way of working his machine causes the spectators
to laugh at him until he gets his calfless limbs into play.
Then he does travel; possibly, like a few other men,.
Turner’s calves are on his heart instead.

Eno’s “Fruit Salt” is particularly valuable. —
No TRAVELLER should leave home without a
supply, for, by its use, the most dangerous forms
of FEVERS, BLOOD POISONS, &c., are pre-
vented and cured. It is, in truth, a FAMILY
MEDICINE CHEST in the simplest yet most
potent form. Instead of being lowering to the
system, this preparation is, in the highest degree,
invigorating. Its effect in relieving thirst, giving
tone to the system, and aiding digestion, is most
striking. Sold by all chemists and stores.*

H. Hayes, riding first in the recent big N.S.W.
road cycle-race, won a “ performance ” vvhose hum shou.d
reach the bounds of the Australian cycling world. Also,
the Humber cycle notched a win which will give it
another peg on which to hang sold Humbers. The race’s
first prize was a Humber, given by the Humber people,
and Haves, the winner, rodoa Humber, with Dunlop tires.

The absurdity of the League of Yie. Wheelmen
officials in choosing the Coburg to Somerton course in-
stead of a decent stretch of road, for the decision of the
25-Mile Road Premiership, last Saturday, did not prevent
A. A. Middleton from pedalling over its bumpy surface in
1 hour 16min. 36sec. This really magnificent perform-
ance will not directly benefit the plucky wobbler one iota
individually, as the prizes are awarded only to the clubs
on points, and Middy’s E. Melb. mates were too far behind
to score nearer than a second place to S. Melb.
* * * »
The Interprovincial Cycling Conference sitting
in Melbourne has given a nasty slap to Melb. Bicycle Club,
whence all the Vic. delegates are drawn, by ruling that at
all League-patronised meetings the entrance and accept-
ance fees of any race shall not exceed 1 per cent, of the
prize-money, the M.B.C. has for years been paying the
whole big prize-money of its much-boomed Austral Wheel
Race (£250) out of its entrance and acceptance fees, which
totalled £2 per man.
During the past couple of seasons, cycling has
been made farcical by every tenth-rate back-block town-
ship running a “ one-mile champidnship of Australia,”
With £l, 10s., and ss. prizes, at its annual sports-meeting
in ptlWlican Dooley's paddock. Henceforth, only one
championship per year is to be allowed, each province to
have the different distances in rotation, and prizes of not
less than £lO and £5 are to be offered. A suggestion that
only bona fide residents of Australia be allowed to com-
pete was fired out—in the interests of “ gate ”
Some enthusiastic Victorians are discussing the
probable result of a match between their idol Parsons,
and Linton, the English crack. Martin, who is not in the
same class as Linton, showed himself to be Parsons’ equal
at any distance, so that if the match eventuates the
swelled heads of Parsons’ admirers will collapse with a
bang.

Marschner, the trick-rider, the other day rode
his machine over the top of a Melb. factory in order to
demonstrate the many advantages of a local two-speed
gear. The invention is simple and works well enough,
but is never likely to pass beyond the fad-stage, as the
tourist is not in a hurry up a hill, and the margin between
the low and high gears is not sufficient to be of service to
the racing-man.

Cyclist Martin has bagged coin in Q. At one
place he won five out of six events, and at another a £25

present Brisbane at Sydney League’s meet next month.

Melb. demise: Octogenarian boat-builder (Green-

though the first ran away from the other two with the
business. Greenland was the Yarra Dictionary, “The
Man in the Ditch,” the oracular Capt. Jack Bunsby of the
concern. When he put in his oar on the rowing question
criticism was dumb.

Pretty safe to say that the Murkan scullers

The extra meetings initiated by the Y.R.C. last
year showed a bare profit of £42 all told. Oup-week

thoroughly healthy condition again.

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her life Miserable, but She is
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Bead the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg:, Victoria, whose por-
trait is also given:

“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
•and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the, blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla,, and I began taking it.
Before 1 lmd finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

THE AUSTRALIAN HEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Naturalist Milligan, of Traralgon, Vic.,
avers that the white-eyed crow has “ loyal ” brown
eyes when a fledgling, which become china-white
about a year after hatching. Though often called
the “ carrion crow,” he won’t feed on carrion. In
captivity he wall take fresh meat, but is strongest
on garden fruit and pepper-tree berries, especially
in summer. Round about Corner Inlet, flocks of
white-eyed crows chum up with sandpipers, sea-
curlews and oystercatchers, and feed with them on
the marine life left by the tide in sand-shallows
and mud-flats.
A quaint example of the disjointedness of
this great h’Empire appears in a divorce-case on
which the English Courts are now trying their
teeth with small results. That is to say, the
results aren’t much so far as the case is concerned,
but the floor is covered with teeth, and the law is
next going to tackle the problem with its gums.
The case is something like this : One Dunster got
married in England, and afterwards settled with
his wife in N.S.W. He was divorced there, the
separated wife going to England, while Dunster
moved on to Maoriland. He was married again
in that province, and later on he and his
wife went back to England, where they ran
upagainst the old wife. Then the trouble
began. The old wife sued for divorce on the
ground that Dunster had deserted her and com-
mitted bigamy, it being alleged on her behalf that
the N.S.W. divorce is of no account, being only a
common colonial separation, and that she is still
married to Dunster and wants to get rid of him.
Dunster opposes, on the ground that he and the
first Mrs. D. are already separated and can’t be
separated any more ; if he doesn’t maintain this,
and the Court only divorces the first Mrs. Dunster
now, it follows, of course., that the second Mrs.
Dunster has not been married until now, which is
an awkward situation. And the English Divorce
Court professes not to know whether a N.S.W.
divorce can dissolve an English marriage, that
being a superior kind of marriage which can’t be
lightly interfered with by any “ blawsted kaw-
liny.” At recent advices the case was adjourned
indefinitely to allow the parties time to pour
water over each other to cool their heated brains.

Extracts from the “ true poem of aN.S.
Wales lunatic-asylum keeper ” received by The
Bulletin
I am a Lunatic Asylum Keeper
In this land, so beautiful and free,
And I don’t suppose a deeper,
Harder, soul-destroying occupation there could be.
Every day, from morn to night,
Lunatics I have to dress and feed ;
And oft before the morning’s light
Round Bedlam’s walls I have to speed.
I must the worst abuse repel
With nought but words like honey sweet,
For else the doctors will expel
My humble self into the dusty street.
Severe attacks I have to stand
From raving madmen, fearless, strong and bold,
Who bite, and strike with hand
As hard as Cromwell’s Ironsides of old.
At night, when other people sleep,
I have few hours that are still;
Some maniac will cry and weep
All night, until I feel quite ill.
All this I have to bear
For fear of losing place and pay ;
And, if I drop a tear,
Remember: I get shillings four per day.
I shall, however, pay them back;
Some day I really mad will be,
And then i will them whack
Until the rank injustice they can see.

Hobart Town, has been on the spree, but had re-
plenished his swag before starting the orgy.
Sobering up, he asks Paunchy, the publican, tor
h s bundle. This is not Billy’s first failure in
Borrowaway, so Paunchy tries to ‘ have him.
“Why, you sold it to me for fourteen bob!”
“ You villain, I’ll have the value !”- —and he put
his fists through all the bottom windows of the
Royal (God save the name !). When ascending to
complete the decoration of the top storey, the law
reached out its long arm. “Three months, but
you must get your swag back : there was no sale.
After fourteen weeks, Billy again breasts the
bar : “Paunchy, I’m here to smash more windows.
A clay’s free drink and a solatium of five shillings
induce him to migrate across the river into Vic-
toria, muttering as he goes, “A crown sd- -cl
little for three months.” Oh ! for the good old
times and timers.— Scotty the Wrinkles.

Report by ROBERT GIBSON, Esq., M.E., Consulting Engineer to the Octagon Syndicate.
To the Promoters of the Kalgoorlie Prince of Wales Mine.
At your request I have made a thorough inspection of Gold Mining Lease No. 2688 E, known as
“Hannan’s Hill End Extended,” and beg to hand you herewith my report on same.
This property comprises a total area of 15 acres, being surveyed portion No. 2GBBE. It is
splendidly situated, adjoining as it does the famous “ Hannan’s Reward ’’ on the east, the Hannan s
Proprietary Co.’s property on the west, whilst to the north lies the Hannan s Reward ISorth and
“ Hannan’s Central ” Gold Mines. I look upon this section as one of the best position blocks available
at the present time in this district. On the Hannan’s Reward property they have proved the lode
down to a depth of 300 feet in hard country, and at that level the lode has an assay value of 2oz. gold
per ton, over a width of 5 feet. , .
Towards the centre of the section is a small hill, and along the cap of this rise is the outcrop of an
immense body of quartzite, quartz, and ironstone mixed, which varies m width up to 20 feet The
trend of this outcrop is almost due north and south, and underlying east On the top of the hill, and
on the west side of the outcrop, a shaft has been sunk to a depth of 100 feet, and a crosscut driven east
to cut the lode formation. At a point 100 feet from the shaft the first indications of the lode were met
with the crosscut passing into an ironstone formation, intermixed throughout with quartz seams. This
has been driven on for a short distance, but, in my opinion, it is merely an offshoot from the mam body
of stoned At 128 feet from the shaft the main lode was struck. The crosscut is now 5 feet into the
lode and no walls are showing. It is a fine body of stone, and has a much more pleasing appearance
than on the surfaeeyeontaining as it does a much larger percentage of iron in the form of hematite, and
bands of quartz intermixed throughout the quartzite. .
The whole of this lode gives very encouraging prospects, and it is a promising indication of better
results being obtained when further developed. _ .
Further north along this outcrop another shaft has been sunk to a depth of 80 feet, and a crosscut
driven east, but this will have to be extended a considerable distance further to cut the reef as it is
dipping eastward. A gold-bearing quartz leader is also showing m the west side of this shaft foi a
width of 6 to 8 inches.
Towards the RE. corner a costeen exposes a strong ironstone formation for a width of 2 feot. This
has been proved gold bearing, and is well worthy further development. It has a trend IN. ~ an
probably junction with the main lode within this section. ... . ,
In addition to the visible outcrops on this area the surface indications point favorably to the
existence of other gold-bearing formations.
The developments on the surrounding properties are more than sufficient to warrant a vigorous
policy of prospecting being carried out. The position of this section leaves nothing to be desire ,
I have no hesitation in strongly recommending it as a mining venture of undoubted value.
I am, dear sirs, yours faithfully,
Robert Gibson, M.E.,
(Consulting Engineer to the Octagon Syndicate).
Report by BRIAN HOOKER, Esq., A R.S.M., Lond., Late Mining Manager for
Ivanhoe Gold Mine.
To the Promoters of the Kalgoorlie Prince of Wales Mine.
Acting under your instructions, I have inspected Lease No. 2688 E, known as Hannan s Hill
Extended.
The Lease, containing an area of 15 acres, is situated about a-third of a mile east of Kalgoorlie
township and is bounded on the west by Hannan’s Reward Gold Mining Co., on the north by
Hannan’s Reward North Gold Mining Co., on the east by Hannan’s proprietary Development Co.,
and on the south by the Colonial Goldfields, Ltd.
On the top of the hill, in the centre of the Lease, is a bold outcrop of quartz and ironstone, striking
north and dipping east, which can be traced for a long distance through the property ; this lode carries
gold, its thickness has not been determined, but it is without doubt large.
There are two shafts sunk to test this lode at a depth, each of which is 100 feet deep.
In the north shaft, at the bottom, is a reef about a foot thick, striking north, dipping west; but no
development work has been done on it. A crosscut has been driven to the east, 80 feet in length, but
the lode has not been reached as yet, though there are indications that it is not far off.
The most important development is in the south shaft, from the bottom of which a crosscut has
been driven to the east 128 feet long. At a distance of 100 feet a lode formation 4 feet thick, striking
north, dipping east, has been passed through, and has also been driven on to the south 12 feet—it is oi
the same character as the usual Hannan’s lodes. At the end of the crosscut another formation has been
struck and penetrated for about 4 feet without reaching the hanging-wall ; it is composed of silicious
ironstone, and carries visible gold, at times coarse. It is impossible to give its thickness as yet, nor yet
its strike, 5 but it is dipping to the east. It is, in fact, premature to give as yet a decided opinion as to
its value,'but I think that when the hanging-wall is reached it will be found to be of even greater value
than it is at present.
In the north-east corner of the lease another lode, about 2 feet thick, has been exposed by means of
a trench, from which lode a prospect can be obtained by dollying.
The lease derives considerable value from its position alone, apart from the fact that a lode has
been proved to exist to a depth of 1.00 feet, so, from my knowledge of the Hannan’s district, I fee’
myself justified in recommending the property as one .well worthy of development.
Yours faithfully,
Brian Hooker,
(Associate of the Royal School of Mines, London ; late Queensland Government Mineralogist;
late Manager Ivanhoe G.M. Co. ; Manager North White Feather Consolidated G.M. Co.).

BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Oigans, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrifca-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the, loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
these Bitters I also recommend in D\ spepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herhal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like
Others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, piomoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
w ., deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
Of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—It is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.

Dear Bulletin,— Re a recent par. of yours.
If only Randolph Bedford would go seriously for
the G«vernor-generalship of Australia, what a
time the country would have ! “ What a time .
Whatatime ! What a glaring time!” — J’Aiderais.
“Hyde Pank, London,” writes an Austra-
lian abroad to The Bulletin, “ was almost gal-
vanised out of its rigid vacuousness one recent
morning by the appearance of a lovely girl on a
pink-enamelled bike, followed by a flunkey m
groom’s garb, also on two wheels. The maiden
was innocently young, and her long, loose hair
quivered in golden undulations to her shapely
waist (“ The Heiress of Hyde Park, or the boiled
Flunkey”). She wore a skirt-costume of bright
red, lavishly trimmed with snowy white, and rode
like a bush belle who could ride. The flunk a
nigger dressed in dark green with rosetted
topper and Wellingtons, and a flaring yellow belt,
looked like a gangrened black-pudding with a
pain in its middle.
A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.

hand 'Books ; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, T ancy

11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Child s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. Ihe
mam walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long.*
Any Victorian Homer looking round for
an epical theme is recommended to Jos. Symes s
“ Secular Society ” :
This troublous association was initiated in’B2, and the
first row occurred in ’BB between Symes and certain of his
council of thirty—over Symes and co.’s anarchial tenden-
cies. The trustees, secretary, and 16 councillors seceded.
Symes’s crowd then elected new members,_ also new
trustees and a new secretary, excommunicating the old
lot and declaring them bogus. Time passed, and Symes
half-built a hall on the land which was bought by the
undivided whole—but the old trustees held the deeds of
the land. More time passed, and a second secession took
place—anarchy again the trouble. New and old seceders
joined forces, and, having gained admission to the hall
built bv Symes, by stratagem barred the other side out.
Symes’s hall-porter had, however, barricaded himself in
his own room, and at 1 a.m. Symes’s party, provided witn
scaling ladders, effected an entrance into this room. The
other side had, however, barricaded the door from the
outside. The barricade was broken down, and the
besiegers attacked the garrison left to hold the fort, lhe
latter were easily driven out from the back premises, but
the main hall was defended by a stream of cold water from
afire-hose. Symes’s pal'ty, however, gallantly breasted
this, and utterly routed the defenders, who fled into the
street, leaving Symes in triumphant possession. At 7
a.m. the commissariat department of the beaten side
turned up with a large basket of provisions and drink-
ables. A disguised voice hailed them from an upper
window, and asked them to send the basket up
by a rope, it being unsafe (so the voice said) to
open a door. This was done, and Symes and party
then appeared at the window and jeered at the
disgusted commissariat and ate and drank with much
smacking of lips. Then the old trustees successfully in-
stituted proceedings against Symes for possession of the
hall, and defendants and their furniture were thrown into
the street by the sheriff. Nominees from both parties
remained to watch the furniture and effects all night.
Early in the morning the sheriff’s officer left the building,
and' Symes and party rushed it. Proceedings were at
once taken to attach Symes for contempt, but unsuccess-
fully. However, fresh proceedings were successfully taken
for possession, and Symes and party had again to retire,
but they then brought an action against the old trustees
for breach of trust. The case lasted seven days; Symes
lost, and the hall was let to the Spiritualists.
Now Vic. Supreme Court is trying, with much
tribulation, to wind the whole thing up, and won-
dering how on earth to get to work, seeing that
the “Secular Society” was neither limited co.,
unlimited co., nor partnership concern. Mean-
while, Joe Symes sits amid his ruins and raves
and weeps. It’s all really very churchy.

TO MINING COMPANIES, BATTERY OWNERS
AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha’s
Patent Battery Plates.
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased bv fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

Latest alligator perjury from the North
(the term crocodile is unknown in Northern par-
lance). A citizen of Cooktown secured several
alligator eggs, and, intending to keep them as
curios, placed them inside his shirt for safety on
the way home. Feeling a slight irritation after a
while, he opened his shirt and found that the heat
of his body had hatched the eggs, and that three
sprightly young saurians were burrowing for
tucker in his manly bosom. Next!
H. : “If you’ve got power, you’ve got to
keep it. Czar Nicholas 1., who obstinately re-
fused to free the Serfs, like Palmerston with
Reform, used to go alone about the St.
Petersburg streets with impunity, looking into
the shop-windows. The freeing of the Serfs was
the first stab at the Czardom. Resembled Louis
Philippe’s action in fetching Napoleon’s ashes
from St. Helena. Mistaken generosity—from the
trade viewpoint.”

From a Letter written by Henry Withering,
Engineer in Charge N.E. Division, to Chief
Engineer, Works Department, Calcutta.
* * * * . .
“ Of course, by this time, you have seraa my report to
the Governor-General on the whole matter , and probably
the incident is looked upon at headquarters as merely i W
unprecedented coincidence. I know what the -
think and say—they say the bridge was destroyed by the
Brahmin high-.priest, who literally played it into destiuc
tion with a fiddle. ,
“ Now, that a whirlwind should come down from. Heaven
and destroy only a powerful suspension bridge," h .
no rigid resistance in any direction, is remarkable » >
for we know these circular storms have a path < 1
drop like thunderbolts : but that this should happen just
when a British force was about to cross it, with a moral
certainty of overtaking the fugitive rajah, who 1 ' ■
ing with him Brahminical treasure valued at millions
sterling—l say, that all this should happen at this
precise moment staggers the imagination. Ik J ~
much interested in the wave theory in physics, and in the
recent expositions of the effects of sympathetic vibration.
I, therefore, wish to recall to your mind a peculiarity of
the Indian fiddle-tbat is, that it possesses subsidiary or
sympathetic strings, not touched at all by tne per-
£o‘“you are familiar with the swaying rock in Cashmere,
estimated to weigh eight thousand tons, which rockea
only at a certain musical festival, and you remenihei pio-
bably that since the destruction of the large bell 111 the
temple hard by, the rock became a fixture , though
may tell you that the priests have been hard at work
casting bells ever since. . . . , T
“ Altogether, as it were in spite of my judgment, I
seem forced to believe that the Hindoos have carried the
vibratory thesis to a stage of w'hich we have on y 1
dimmest conception.”

From the Private Papers of Surgeon H.
R. Macdonald, formerly of the Indian
Army.
# * * *
“ The playing of the man with the fiddle began to weary
me. It had been quite pleasant at first—something of a
solace to my imprisonment—but the monotony of it now
troubled me. The music always beat 111 the same measure,
and ever returned in its melody to the same motive-key.
“ Exactly how long the old Brahmin outside had been
playing I could not tell : he certainly was busy when I
first woke in the morning, and now, though the evening
was drawing in fast, he gave no sign of cessation. Oi the
contrary, it seemed that the volume of sound from his
instrument increased very slightly, biH continually. •
“The other priests, in the small Hindoo laboiers hut
where I was confined, swung their bodies unceasingly to
the regular rhythmic metre of the music. ~
“ 1 had fallen to sleep, and woke again more than once
before I perceived a peculiar straining and whistling
sound which also seemed to mark the time. This alone
hardly interested me, but I sat up suddenly enough on
my mat, with a feeling of more than mere curiosity,
when I first noticed that the beams of the moon, stream-
ing through the hole in the wall which served for a
window, were partly obscured and dismayed alternately,
in accordance with the eternal measure of the music.
And then, in addition, I became aware of the noise of a
yreat wind, which roared up to the hut at the darkening
of the moon, and receded again, only to rush up as before.
The same wind stirred in my hair and rustled the gar-
ments of the priests; but they, all indifferent and with
eyes ecstatically seeing nothing, continued then obei-
sances, yet now more violently and hysterically, as
though their task were approaching some culmination.
“ This indifference of the Brahmm-the unusual
noises—the rush of the tempest the now entire blotting-
out of the moon.by some enormous interposition all this,
happening synchronously with the ebb and flow of the
strains of the Bralnnin’s fiddle, impressed me with I know
U °“ i' pulled out my watch to try and note the rapidly-
shortening duration of the musical period. The wind
had increased to a screaming typhoon, amidst clankmgs
of the chains of ten thousand convicts. I was sensible of
a tremor of the earth. . . Urged by an uncontrollable
terror, I sprang for the door, deflecting with my pinioned
hands, in passing, the ready dagger of one of the priests.
It went ripping through my clothes, but I dashed on and
gained the open. , .

“The waters of the river which the bridge spanned
were forced into a black hollow by the wind which went
with its swing. The clanking noise I had heard was that
of the chains"which supported the bridge, and the darken-
ing of the interior of the hut was caused by the interven-
tion of the bridge in its pendulmn-swing between the
window and the moon.
“ Suddenly I saw the strings of the fiddle fly asunder ,

limit of-tension, burst with an awful clang ; and the huge
structure rushed instantly into the river beneath, lhe

Nine hundred head of cattle, alarmed by
kangaroo-rats, stampeded, the other day, at
Mudgee (N.S.W.), and some of them were not re-
covered. Not long ago a colonial-experience man,
smoking on watch alongside a camp-fire, was sur-
prised to find a steer sniffing at the fire-stick with
which he had just lit his pipe. Out of mischief he
just touched the animal’s nose with the lighted
end, whereupon the beast turned tail and stam-
peded, the whole mob following. Once Billings
menagerie halted at a cattle-station, and in the
early morning an attendant flung open the doors
of the tigers’cage and exposed them —behind the
bars, of course—to the view of the mob of cattle.
At one roar from the tigers the whole mob stam-
peded. In the Crimea, all the horses of a cavalry
regiment stampeded, and were galloping towards
the Russian lines when a bugler had presence of
mind to sound the dinner-call. They all turned
and trotted back. They were British horses.
A recent Melb. insolvency-case discovered
to Victorians the champion useful woman. Prior
to marrying insolvent (who had been living apart
from his wife, paying alimony), witness swore that
she had been manager of a coffee-palace, ana,
pitying 1 insolvent’s loneliness, shared hearth ana
home with him in her cottage. When he was out
of work and his wife was pressing for overdue
alimony, she paid it off and kept on paying it out
of a boarding-house speculation. She also was a
successful dog-breeder, and always commanded
highest prices in this line ; also, to furthei occupy
her time, indulged in poultry -farming, which
brought more grist to the mill. Then, finding she
had an hour or two to spare, she made up pinafores
and children’s dresses, and further increased her
banking-account. Time still hung heavy on he
hands, so she added property-speculation to her
occupations, and worked off several paying house
and land deals. The demon of idleness still pur-
sued her, so the balance of her time was devoted
to money-lending and anything else that came in
her way. Then insolvent’s wife died, and, having
a few minute? unoccupied, she married him ; and
although her multitudinous occupations demanded
increasing attention, yet she had contrived to be
present at the court as a creditor in her husband s
estate for <£lBs money lent. Then, having fired
all this off in a stream of eloquence unbroken by
the slightest pause, she invited further interroga-
tion as to her business capacity ; but, beyond
muttering in an undertone that this was the genius
Premier Turner should have secured to straighten
up the national railway - muddle, the presiding
Judge said nothing except that the meeting was
there and then closed.
Perhaps the most interesting and best
authenticated cavalry duel on record, also the
fairest “test match” of lance v. sword, was the
charge of the British 7th Hussars on the French
Lancers in the main street.of the village of Hemappe
on the day of Quatre Bras, as detailed by bir
Evelyn Wood in “ Cavalry m the Waterloo Cam-
The centre paved roadway has here a wide, umnetalled
track on either side and three vehicles can move abreast
along it without difficulty, It will allow of froml2 to 14
horsemen moving in a line on it. As the head of the
French column of Lancers in red jackets appeared at the
exit from the street the 7th Hussars, working unde the
immediate eye of Lord Uxbridge, were iet; go,and they
galloped boldly at their foe drawn up on t ero ul. 'rhe
Lancers pulling the flank men close to the walls of the
houses, dropped their lance-points and at the halt awaited
the attack. This, was vigorously pushed home, but the
Hussars were unable to penetrate the line of steel
pofnte Both the French and English squadron
leaders hemmed in by the crossed weapons, weie
killed ’ and the Hussars failed to break through
the line of Lancers. They fought desperately for
some time, but were eventually driven back, The tfuceis
then followed them up hut were attacked by a fresh
squadron of Hussars and driven back mto the town.
Again and again were these charges renewed , as Lord
Uxbridge wrote : “ A determined see-saw being kept up
for a considerable time.” Lord Uxbridge eventually
withdrew the 7th Hussars, and riding to i t to
regiment (another light cavalry regiment) ordered it to
advance upon the French Lancers. Our men had, how-
ever, learnt to appreciate the power of the lance, and
Lord U.’s address, “ not being received with all the en-
thusiasm he had anticipated,” he ordered the regiment to
the rear. .
Sir Evelyn Wood, further on in the same article,
states that “ the French lancers were small men
on light horses, and, being new levies, could have
had but a very elementary training. ¥et under
absolutely fair conditions they were able to hunt
off the field one of the crack British Hussar
regiments—which seems strong testimony to the
sujjeriority of lance over sword in cavalry charges.

Extract from a teetotaller’s letter on the
Vic. wine-industry, in Melb. Age
Scores of families have been absolutely mmed inthe
north-eastern district by wine-making. Vanou t of
that district, which takes in Eutherglen, have witnessecl
some of the blackest domestic tragedies that ever dis
figured a nation’s history as the result of wme mak g.
One valley alone, extending a distance of about 12
and which presented a scene of flourishing "idustry prior
to the introduction of wine-making, came to■ be sub-
sequently known as “Drunken Gully after the farms
were turned into vineyards. Every once-prosperous home-
stead with the exception of one, was rendered desolate.
I could cite numerous instances of tragic deaths caused
bv the wine, some dying bottle in hand, others found
dead by their own wine-casks, others being killed while
drunk with wine by falling from drays, from horse-
back • and among many other cases I can cite one of
a wife and mother calling upon God to curse the wine,
then taking an axe and staving in every bari'd ni the
cellar. Instances of drunkenness, rum and death abso-
lutely heartrending and appalling, could be multiplied.
If Mr. Buckley is disposed to stigmatise these statements
as exaggerations then let a board of inquiry be appo.mtcd
to make strict, impartial investigation, and it will be
found that the history of wine-making in the north-east
is simply black with horrors. Giving a bonus to such an
« industry ” (?) is very like paying a premium for the luin
of the nation’s manhood and womanhood. The moral
disasters that have occurred in this district m connection
with wine-making are far and «.way beyond the power of
language to exaggerate.
Premier Turner had bettei appoint that ooard of
inquiry at once. The God-forgotten region above-
described should be worth inquiring into.

The First Mate’s Finger.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They had “risen” whales —a perfect
School of them—miles ahead, early in the after-
noon. The Derwent was a “clean ship,” so there
was hurry to be away after the “fish,” even
though it meant a long pull to windward. Two
boats lowered, the first and second mates in charge
respectively. There was little wind, and, but for
the long ocean swell, the sea was calm.
A hard tug at the oars brought them up with
their prey. Both boats were soon “fast” and
travelling swiftly away in contrary directions, in
tow of big whales. The second mate was for-
tunate ; he soon killed his fish, and proceeded to
tow the carcase to the ship, which had worked up
to within three miles of them when they adminis-
tered the coup de grdce. By the time they got to
the vessel it was dark, and, in the excitement of
securing the whale alongside, those on board lost
sight of the other boat, which, when last seen, was
miles away but still “ fast.”
* * * *
The mate had hitched on to a regular
tartar, which, when struck, had started off by
“ sounding ” till nearly all the line was out. Then
he appeared on top again, but before they could
haul up to him he was off once more at racing
speed, dragging them away from the ship. So
the conflict went on. As the afternoon drew to a
close the question of cutting clear was discussed,
but the majority applied the Yankee whalers’
dictum, “ a stove boat or a dead whale,” and
held that the fish could not last much longer, and
that the night being fine, the ship would soon
pick them up. It was nearly dark when they got
up to him and made play with the lances till he
“spouted thick blood.” Then came the “ flurry”
—and a short, mad rush. Ere the crew could pull
clear, so unexpected and sudden was the rally, the
whale came straight at the boat, scattering occu-
pants and gear in the sea. It was his last effort —
the final. A swirl of foam-beaten, blood-tinged
water, and the fish floated dead.
* * * *
Only four of the crew came to the surface—
the other two were not seen again. Probably
stunned, or entangled in the gear, they went to
their last account without a struggle. The sur-
vivors held on the upturned boat and reviewed
matters. Night was closing in, and, strain their
eyes as they might, they could see nothing of the
ship. Then they attempted to right the boat to
ascertain the extent of the damage. This cost
mother life ; one of the hands disappearing sud-
denly. With the fear of sharks in their hearts,
the three who were left clambered on to the boat’s
bottom. Then came the struggle with Death.
The boat, rolling in the trough of the sea, flung
them off as often as they bestrode her, for there
was nothing by which they could retain their hold.
At last one said he had “ had enough,” and, with
a farewell message, gave up, leaving now only the
mate, Johnson, and the boat-steerer.
With words of encouragement to each other,
these two continued the fight. After great diffi-
culty Johnson managed to shove the plug out of
the “garboard strake,” and then was able to keep
his position across the keel of the boat by insert-
ing his right fore-finger—his companion holding
on to him. The blackness of night over and about
them; the eternal swish of water ready to engulf
them as it had engulfed their companions ; no
signs of help. Still, they clung and hoped.
* * » •
All at once Johnson felt his comrade’s
grip slacken, as with a moan the man fell into the
sea. His first impulse was to attempt a rescue,
but he found that he could not now detach him-
self from his place his numbed finger had so
swollen as to completely block the hole. He,
“the last of six,” was left alone. So the night
dragged on.
* * * *
On the Derwent a diligent watch was kept
up through the hours of darkness —the vessel
making short boards to windward the while.
Lights were burnt and guns fired at intervals. At
first signs of daylight eager eyes resultlessly swept
the horizon. It was nearly noon when one of the
look-out-menreportedlargenumbers of birds ahead,
almost in the vessel’s course. Then they sighted
a dark object which was at first mistaken for a
whale. As they got closer they made it out to be
a boat with a figure astride it. It was Johnson,
frantically waving his free arm and yelling to
frighten the birds which every now and then
swooped down at him. A boat’s crew was soon to
his relief, but before they could remove him they
had to chop the plank to release his finger. He
could not have fallen off had he wanted to.
It was a thoroughly unnerved man they received
on board. Now that the worst was over, Johnson
became like a frightened infant, sobbing convul-
sively and talking incoherently, and clutch-
ing and holding on to everything within grasp as
they bore him along the deck. He thought of and
knew nothing beyond holding on for dear life, and
his arms had to be secured ere he could be carried
down the narrow companion-way which led to his
berth.
He pulled round—though he lost his faithful
finger—and fastened to many another whale.

TAHUNE LINAH.
A Maori Play,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The capture of the Kelly gang in Victoria was an
event which excited the greatest interest among
the Maoriland aborigines. To them Ned Kelly,
the outlaw, was a hero greater by far than the
bravest soldier of whom they had any knowledge.
He was a man whose name they revered, whose
deeds they cherished, whose life was full of merit.
The break-up of the Kelly gang happened at a
time when the Maoris were reaping a rich harvest
from the sale of their lands, and when they had
more money than they knew what to do with.
Some of the leading tribes had gathered into
Waikato to watch their interests before the Land
Court, and all kinds of diversions were indulged in
to make the time pass merrily. There were con-
certs and dances, boxing-matches and drinking-
bouts, horse-races and football-matches.
Some of the native dandies, knowing that I
wrote for the papers, asked me to write a play.
They thought that if I could dramatise the capture
of Ned Kelly they could make it “go” among
their people, and even the Europeans would come
to see it. They grew so enthusiastic over the idea
that they soon overcame any scruples I might
have had, and induced me to undertake a task
for which I felt I was ill-fitted.
J wrote the play. I do not say so boastingly,
for it was not a success. When the curtain went
down on the memorable scene that represented
the final the last act there were no calls of
Author; on the contrary, I honestly believe
that bad the author been recognised in the build-
lng he would have come in for a very bad time
Ihe piece was called “The Last Stand of the
Kellys, or the Battle of Glenrowan.”
There was a stormy time, to begin with, in
settling the cast. Fully half-a-dozen members of
the tribe wanted to take the part of Ned Kelly
and when that was settled there was a prolonged
squabble as to who should be Ban Kelly and Steve
Hart The selection of the lady to take the part
of Kate Kelly gave rise to so much bad feeling
and dissension that for a week the play was at a
standstill. At last the gentleman who was cast
for the part of Ned Kelly, and who was finding
most of the money for the venture, carried his
point and established in the part his sweetheart, a
pum-blooded, excessively-tattooed girl of sixteen.
Ihe play was interpreted into Maori, and re-
hearsals began. The town was billed, leading
people were invited, seats were marked off, and
in every respect the appointments were generous,
this was the bill :

When the eventful night arrived the curtain
went up on a crowded and demonstrative house.
Ihe great bulk of those present were Maori or
halt-caste. Ihe play was written more as a
tragedy than as a comedy. Yet, as it was inter-
preted, it seemed to be nothing but comedy, or
as the local paper termed it, “a tragedy bur-
lesque. It certainly did suggest the idea of a
screaming farce at some points, and narrowly
escaped, towards the close, resulting in one of the
most real tragedies that the stage has ever wit-
nessed.
The first act was a bush-scene with the sticking-
up of an invisible mail-coach and the rifling of the
passengers, one of whom was knocked on the head
by a bushranger in a manner so realistic that the
luckless fellow fell across the footlights and nar-
rowly escaped being roasted alive among the
fragments of a kerosene-lamp.
The audience roared with delight at this, and
the actors exchanged words of encouragement
with their friends “ in front.”
The second act was a representation of the bush-
rangers’ dance in the Glenrowan shanty, where
the Kellys made merry with the girls before the
police arrived. So as to make the scene thoroughly
realistic, bottles of genuine liquor were put in cir-
culation, with the result that when the curtain
rose on the third and last act there was not a sober
sri^^,„Tkr m TiiS digl,testeffottre “^
•A 11 t} ! e b? an k-cartridges having been exhausted
in the sticking-up scene in the, first act, there were
none available for the battle of Glenrowan, with
which the play was to be brought to a thrilling-
termination. It was therefore agreed that ball-
cartridge should be used, as the audience would
d ‘ fferei \ ce ’ Particularly as all shots
could be fired through the roof and not directly
at the objects of attack on the other side
When Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, and Steve Hart
appeared, each with a nail-can on his head and
carrying tin armour and a brace of revolvers, there
were shouts of delight. The police-party (some of
them trouserless) came on and retreated, subse-
quently taking up their position at the wings,
10m the shelter of which they fired on the out-
iaws every time the latter emerged from their
iding-place. Ihe shooting, which was slight at
first soon developed into a fusillade, and the
SIVS 18 ! 6 ?! across the stage in all directions
until Ned Kelly was seized round the legs and
carried off triumphantly through the wings, the
wounded outlaw emptying his pistol through the
root as he vanished amidst great cheering.
How act three ended without a fatality I have
never been able to understand. That there were
many narrow escapes was clear from the bullet-
fioles in the w-alls as well as in the roof, some of
those who fired aiming merely over the heads of
them opponents. The youth who took the part of
toteve Hart had a particularly narrow escape—he
got off unwounded, though his visor was pierced
in two places.
