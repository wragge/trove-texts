Alcan adds ideas to
aluminium... so foil
can seal milk
safely every day.
Each morning when your milkman delivers the goods, it's thanks
in part to Alcan.
Milk. Fresh. Protected by Alcan aluminium foil bottle tops. Hygienically
sealed with the pouring lip sterilised for total protection.
Next time you take off the top remember this: more than 8 million
clean, fresh, sterilised bottles of milk are sealed tight, sealed right, every
day with Alcan aluminium foil.
Just one of the many ways every Australian benefits by the ideas Alcan
puts into aluminium.
"Automatic machines fill and cap milk bottles at 400 a minute.
Foil must be precision-machined for absolute accuracy. (A flaw in gauge,
width or consistency could jam the process.)
Alcan adds ideas to aluminium and the result is foil that seals milk safely every time.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Where there's a Pill
there's a way to
get Leslie to Wesley
YOU WILL APPRECIATE, of course,
that in the egalitarian 1960 s the cachet
of the independent school label is no
longer necessary. The opportunities are
equal regardless of school. So many
people believe this that the struggle to
pay $2OO a term for your child has be-
come the greatest competitive education
struggle of all.
Here in Melbourne we humiliate our-
selves by pleading with tears in our
eyes to headmasters to take our chil-
dren. A child must be entered for the
favored school on date of birth, and
the month has to be early in the school
year. Well-organised pill-taking Mel-
burnian public school mothers are now
careful to have their children in
January.
This week we have had the best
chance of looking at one of our great
public schools for many a day.
Wesley College has done well for pub-
licity. A fifth-form boy, Brian Hall, 16,
wrote a letter to the school magazine,
the “Chronicle.” Maybe because Sir
Robert Menzies and Harold Holt were
old boys, it made the front pages of
the newspapers. He talked of lack of
school spirit, of hooliganism, of thefts
of school property, and went on to
say that boys at the tuck shop acted
like a horde of savages. He began his
letter: “As one who first believed
Wesley to be one of the best schools in
Victoria, my confidence in that ideal
is fast being destroyed by the disgust-
ing hooliganism, which one can see
every day in the school grounds, by-
boys who are supposedly products of
a superior education. After five years
in the school I have seen standards of
discipline go from bad to worse and
it is high time something was done to
remedy the fact.”
The headmaster, Dr. Coates, replied
with beautiful restraint, “The road to
perfection is a long and hard one, and
when it is reached all schools will be
out of business.”
Then in the midst of all this we
received a copy of the school history,
“Wesley College—The First Hundred
Years,” by Geoffrey Blainey, James
Morrissey, and S. E. K. Hulme. Most
school histories are about as exciting as
the parish paper, but, by heavens, this
one is different. It tells the truth.
For example, there was a headmaster
who fiddled the funds. The school pros-
pectus stated that he was a salaried
headmaster, which meant he was “freed
from the anxieties of financial arrange-
ment.”
Mr. Thomas Palmer needed more.
He gathered £lOOO and kept on gath-
ering. In 1902 he was caught. The
committee felt “silence” was the wiser
course for the school, and Mr. Palmer
quietly departed.
And for those of us who sweat to
find the right tie for our offspring, it is
interesting that in the first 50 years the
competition was on for students. It
was the same at all church schools
there weren’t enough fee-paying scholars
to go round. The school wasn’t par-
ticular if those scholars weren’t Wes-
leyans. Publicity was important, so
speech days were great events, more
important than now. The Governor
of the Colony always attended and the
prizes offered were numerous, often
valuable. The young headmaster, Pro-
fessor Irving, was very good at this. In
his five years as headmaster he gave
the school a brilliant scholastic reputa-
tion and in 1871 built the roll to 266
boys, a figure that wasn’t approached
again for 30 years. He even snared
Rupert Clarke, son of the ultra-Angli-
can and very rich Sir William Clarke,
Bart.
What other incidents? Irving’s suc-
cessor, Henry Martyn Andrew, got into
trouble for losing his temper and flog-
ging a boy 21 times around the back
and shoulder with a cane. The boy's
father took him to the Prahran Court.
In court Andrew recalled Irving’s part-
ing advice as headmaster: “Andrew,
don’t flog rashly, but when you flog,
flog well, that you may not be required
to do it again.” The court didn’t agree,
convicted Andrew, and fined him £5.
But the public was all on Andrew’s
side. There was a subscription fund to
pay his fine and the “Argus” in an
editorial on February 25, 1&76, said
that corporal punishment “is even more
“Well, er,... we are trying to be
ecumenical!”
necessary here than it is in the mother
country, because domestic restraints are
so much weaker in Victoria, and the
physical and mental development of
the young proceeds so much more
rapidly.”
L. A. Adamson, Wesley headmaster,
1902-32, was a huge figure here, the
Dr. Arnold of Australia. In the book
he is treated with a curious mixture
of love, respect, awe, and at times
outright scepticism. Some Wesley col-
legians already have been terribly
shocked by the line “Adamson was not
an outstanding scholar, athlete, teacher,
or sporting coach.”
Adamson adored the ideal of the
schoolboy athlete and in the Edwardian
years Wesley had incredible success.
Adamson used to compose songs about
his most brilliant boys. “Harry Rover”
was composed in honor of Harry Prout
who dominated school football from
1903 to 1907.
There’s a chap that Wesley’s known for
many a day,
We mostly call him Harry just for
short —
He can run a bit and jump a lorigish
way,
But at football he’s a quint-essential
snort.
He’s a ducky. He’s a daisy. He’s a trick,
He’s an injia-rubber idiot on the spree.
It would take a double eighteen for to
lick
Little Harry when he’s going strong and
free.
Harry, alas, was no great scholar and
he hadn't proceeded far with his edu-
cation when advancing years forced him
to leave school. Yet the Adamson era
created a remarkable list of great men,
including Menzies and Holt. We are
told that Menzies proved himself one
of the school’s outstanding poets when
the writing ol verse “was considered the
most estimable intellectual pursuit.” At
the end of his third year he won the
English Exhibition. But although some-
thing of a walker, Menzies was no
athlete “and in Adamson’s mind poetry,
intellect, and notable qualities of leader-
ship did not make a man a prefect.”
Harold Holt, thojugh, was one of Adam-
son’s favorite students in the 19205, and
much admired for his outstanding skill
as a footballer.
In 1933, after Adamson’s death, the
school was rundown, dilapidated, and
overcrowded. Then, incredibly, unin-
vited along came the brothers. A. M.
and G. R. Nicholas and, at the height
of the Depression, gave £200,000 for
the re-building of the College, the rich-
est gift ever to an Australian school. For
ever after at boat races we chanted
“ASPRO, ASPRO YAH YAH YAH,”
but it was worth it for Wesleyans, for,
after this, the school never looked back
and is now a very great school. But if
they are having any discipline troubles
there’s always the advice of Professor
Irving: “Don’t flog rashly, but when you
flog, flog well.”

dred Years.” Robertson and Mullens.

Earthman, take
me to your
leader-writer
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
WE LIVE IN troubled times, with
conflicts in Aden, Detroit, Canberra,
Leopoldville, and elsewhere. Few
people pause to give thought to the
difficulties of the men whose thankless
task it is to comment on these events
in the daily Press. So I am going to
describe the scene one afternoon
recently in the office of the editor of
the “Daily Announcer.”
The editor was frowning as he read
a typed article. He said to the leader-
writer: “You refer here to the ‘deep-
ening crisis’ in American race rela-
tions. Are you sure a crisis can become
deeper?”
The leader-writer said: “We had a
heightened crisis last week in a leader
on Britain’s balance of payments. I
thought if we could heighten a crisis,
we could deepen it, sir.”
“That heightened crisis was on my
night off,” the editor said. “I doubt
whether we can regard a crisis as hav-
ing dimensions like height and depth.”
The leader-writer said petulantly: “I
wish there weren’t so many crises. I
have to write leaders about them all
the time. Crises in the Labor Party,
in Vietnam, in traffic congestion.”
“Remember,” said the editor, “that
if there were no crises there would be
less work for leader-writers.”
“I suppose so. But we always run
into this problem of what to do when a
crisis gets worse. It sounds feeble to
say it’s more critical.”
The editor looked out of the window.
“Can a crisis become more critical?”
he said. “I feel a crisis is a turning
point, and once you’ve reached it,
things are as critical as they can get.”
“But surely a critical situation can
become more tense, sir?”
The editor said: “Then let’s think
along the lines of tension in U.S. race
relations.”
“What do you say to ‘the mounting
tension in America’?”
The editor drummed his fingers on
the desk. “I don’t like a mounting ten-
sion much more than a deepening
crisis,” he said. “A tension does not,
strictly speaking, rise or mount. The
word, being derived from the Latin
‘tendo, I stretch,’ has the notion of
something pulled sideways, like a rubber
band.”
The leader-writer ran his fingers
through his hair. “Very well, sir,” he
said. “Let’s say the tension in America
is growing or increasing.”
“That is correct, but it’s lacking in
force. Increasing tension is something
we have in minor places like Tan-
ganyika or the Bankstown Council. We
view it with concern. On second
thoughts I believe we must regard the
American situation as critical. Let’s see
if Roget has a good synonym.” From
the Thesaurus, he read out: “ ‘Crisis:
emergency, extremity, predicament,
quandary, pickle, stew, kettle of fish’.”
The leader-writer mused: “That’s
what Queen Mary said when Edward
VIII decided to marry Mrs. Simpson,
‘This is a pretty kettle of fish, Mr.
Baldwin.’ Could we perhaps say: ‘The
kettle of fish in America is growing
prettier’?”
“It’s vivid and unusual,” the editor
said. “But it doesn’t strike the note of
high seriousness we aim at. I don’t
like predicament, either. That’s a word
I prefer to leave to our book-reviewers
they’re always worrying about the
human predicament. And pickle and
stew are too colloquial for the ‘Daily
Announcer’.”
“If you don’t mind, I’ll go away
and think about it some more,” said
the leader-writer.
He came back 15 minutes later and
submitted a revised leading article. The
editor pursed his lips. He said: “You
say now that ‘the American crisis has
reached a new pitch of gravity.’ To
me gravity connotes heaviness, a force
acting downwards. Pitch suggests some-
thing going upwards, as in pitch and
toss. So ‘a new pitch of gravity’ raises
the same difficulty we had with
mounting tension.”
The leader-writer thought hard.
“ ‘The American crisis has increasingly
grave implications.’ What about that,
sir?”
“Splendid! That’s just right.” As the
leader-writer turned to go, the editor
added: “By the way, in that leader
on Whither the Economy? you said:
‘Australia has entered an inflationary
spiral by riding on the sheep’s back
while sheltering behind the tariff wall.’
At ‘The Announcer’ we don’t do those
three things at once.”
“I’ll remember that, sir,” the leader-
writer said.

Young world
A PHENOMENON of life at Kings Cross is the Saturday
night invasion from the suburbs. After the pubs and pictures
have closed, young people leave the outer suburbs, where they
believe nothing ever happens, to go to the Cross, where they
expect to see life. All that happens at the Cross is that the
people who live there go to bed, and the young people walk
around the streets, looking at other young people from the
suburbs, and thinking this is life.
A WHOLE excit-
ing world reflected
in a pair of dark
glasses.


GOING up the Cross is a symbolic
excursion. The only expenditure need
be on a cup of coffee or some
coins to feed a juke-box, as local shop-
keepers can testify with some bitterness.

A MINORITY of the young people investigate
the seamier side of Kings Cross, a few are
looking for fights or kicks, but for most aimlessness
is the aim; and surely time on one’s hands
is the condition and privilege of youth.

Must be a link missing here
Any area of your business relying on
"blotter calculation"? Then, frankly, you
have a link missing. A vital link in a
system planned not only to cut out such
risky "blotter calculations", put to bring
you a dramatic increase in overall effici-
ency and hence contribute to a greater
profitability.
For instance, our experts can after
a fact-finding survey plan a Link-
System for you in which you link a
Remington Calculator to a Remington
accounting machine linked to a Rem-
ington Rotaprint.
Even with the basic system you would
be in an advantageous position of being
able to calculate, handle all book-keeping
details, typing, and at the same time
print all necessary documents even
in colour.
Get the idea? And whatever Link-
System you may need, we also guarantee,
without cost to you, to train your staff
(including EDP people) to efficiently
operate that system. Your enquiry will
be given our experts' complete concen-
tration. And security. All obligation-free
of course.

The high cost
of living
the past again
THE COMMERCIAL BANK of Aus-
tralia, to mark its centenary, made a
handsome and imaginative gift of
$50,000 to restore Old Government
House, Parramatta. It would, how-
ever, cost $50,000, give or take a few
dollars, just to restore the building’s
original shingle roof.
This is one indication of the cost
and difficulty of restoring old build-
ings. However, work by the National
Trust of Australia (N.S.W.) is going
ahead well at Parramatta and the whole
may be finished and open to the public
in November, 1968.
When it is it will be both the oldest
and most important public building
restored and open to the public in Aus-
tralia. Old Government House was
built by Governor Hunter in 1799 and
added to substantially by Governor
Macquarie in 1816. It was in use until
the 1850 s ar*d has proved a much better
survivor than Old Government House,
Sydney, which was pulled down soon
after the present State Government
House was finished in 1845.
Old Government House will put
Parramatta well ahead of Sydney in the
race (if. it is a race; nothing much
happens in Sydney) to restore and
preserve older buildings. Parramatta
now has Experiment Farm Cottage,
which has had as many as 500
American tourists from a Matson liner
converging on it at once, the Lancer
Barracks, Hambledon Cottage, and St.
John’s, and will eventually have Eliza-
beth Farm. The opening of Old Gov-
ernment House will give the National
Trust the opportunity for regular,
organised historical tours of the area.
The first excitement of the present
work was to find, under the floor-
boards of a room affected by dry-rot,
the foundations of an earlier house.
These are being accepted for the
moment by the National Trust and the
honorary architects as belonging to the
house which Governor Phillip built in
1790 and as such are the remains of
the oldest building in Australia.
Beneath the floorboards was also a
tree-stump, which the convict laborers
could not be bothered grubbing out.

Governor Hunter demolished Phillip’s
house, but it seems the foundations
were not removed. One clue is that
the bricks from the earlier foundations
are larger and softer and the mortar
little more than mud, compared with
the Hunter bricks, which again are
larger and softer than the Macquarie
ones.
However, this room is being left
for the moment. Later it is hoped to
do a proper dig beyond the bounds of
the house, in a yard at present covered
with bitumen, to see if, with luck, an
outline of a substantial part of the
“Phillip” house can be unearthed.
Otherwise, if it appears that the rest of
the foundations are under Old Govern-
ment House, a small part may be left
exposed.
Expert advice is being sought (the
tree-stump has been identified by the
Forestry people as probably iron-bark)
to find out the true origin of these
foundations, but carbon dating, which
can narrow periods down from millions
to thousands, has no application when
the period is something like 25 years.
The second discovery is that although
it has always been accepted that the
front part of the house was Macquarie’s
and the back Hunter’s, the reverse may
be the case.
None of these speculations is, of
course, holding up work on the build-
ing. One of the honorary architects, Mr.
Leslie Buckland, of Parramatta, says
that structurally the building, which has
115 squares, is very sound, although
some work is being done on the roof.
Although major structural changes
are not needed, much detailed work is.
Workmen are restoring the fireplaces,
using old sandstock bricks from the
splendid stockpile Mr. Buckland has
built up during other demolition work
in Parramatta. Some have become so
enthusiastic that they go off into the
bush to find suitable sand for mortar.
Fireplaces of redwood and other alien
timbers are being ripped out and re-
placed with cedar. Mr. Buckland also
has a fine supply of old cedar for this
work. There are also beautiful old door-
knobs and locks, as well as enough
handmade nails for any carpentry to
be done.
However, the real benefits of the mag-
pie instincts of the National Trust mem-
bers will be felt when the building is
being furnished. The original purpose
of many of the rooms, such as Mac-
quarie’s bedroom, dressing-room, and
breakfast-room, is known, and it is
intended to furnish as a Governor’s
residence of the period to 1850. So
far, only one piece of the original fur-
niture has been retrieved, but the Nat-
ional Trust remains hopeful that enough
will be received as gifts, or can be
bought, to furnish a house of 115
squares.


MICHAEL BAUME WRITES OK
THE
ECONOMY
Devalue, deflate,
diversify: N.Z.'s
strategic choice
IT IS EASY enough on this side of
the Tasman to tell the New Zealanders
what to do about the mess they have
got themselves into; the three “Ds”
(Devalue the currency, Deflate the
economy, and Diversify exports and
markets) seem inevitable strategies from
over here. But New Zealanders are
refusing to have anything to do with
the first of them, have only gone part of
the way with the second, and have
made only tentative stabs at the third.
This is not simply because they are
unaware of the seriousness of their
present situation, or how much worse
it could so easily become. They refuse
to devalue their obviously overvalued
currency because they consider it quite
inappropriate to do so at the moment;
they are only playing with deflation
because they feel their present moder-
ately recessive measures are tough
enough to solve their immediate prob-
lems; and they are not strenuously
diversifying their exports or markets
(they are doing a bit, of course) be-
cause they cannot envisage a situation
in which Britain will not continue to
be the main outlet for New Zealand
produce, come hell or Gompion
Market.
These objections are not as silly
as they may sound. Firstly, no matter
how ridiculous it was of the New
Zealand Government to let the country
slip into the current economic mess,
it is not simple pigheadedness lying
behind its obstinate refusal to devalue;
secondly, there is some merit in not
kicking the economy really hard if
there is a reasonable chance of the
present measures working; and thirdly,
there is no doubt that the British
market will still be there after the U.K.
goes into Europe and that New Zealand
will be a supplier (even if a smaller
one). There is also no doubt that no
replacement for Britain as a con-
sumer of New Zealand produce seems
likely, so diversification attempts can
only have limited success.
The main case against devaluing is
that most of New Zealand’s export
earnings come from products sold on
foreign markets at world prices; a
fall in the value of the New Zealand
dollar (they decimalised very smoothly
last month) would bring no real advan-
tages to New Zealand producers in
foreign markets nor increase their sales
volume. It would simply increase the
money incomes of New Zealand ex-
porters in their own currency and so
prompt an increase in their spending,
which is exactly what is not wanted. And
there is little likelihood of these higher
money incomes to producers encourag-
ing any significant increase in local
production for export.
At the same time, devaluation would
make all New Zealand’s imports so
much more expensive and would
increase the production costs of its
export earning industries (freight and
fertiliser, its two biggest cost items,
would go up, for example). But be-
cause import restrictions have already
chopped much of the top off import
demand, devaluation would probably
do very little to reduce the level of
imports any further, even though their
cost would rise.
That does not mean devaluation can
be ruled right out. If the price of wool
stays below 30 cents a lb. for much
longer, there could be a drift away from
woolgrowing in New Zealand which
could have a damaging effect on exports
(provided anybody still wants the wool
and the New Zealanders don’t keep
having to buy it up themselves to
prevent the price from collapsing even
further). In this case there could be
some pressure for a devaluation to keep
the wool industry afloat.
The only significant immediate bene-
fits of a devaluation would be in the
tourist industry, firstly as an incentive
for more tourists to come and spend
more money in New Zealand because
it would be cheaper, and secondly to
discourage New Zealanders from going
overseas as tourists because it would
cost them so much more. But in all
the talk about devaluation the fact
remains that if Britain devalues so will
New Zealand; 56 percent of New
Zealand’s export trade is still with
Britain, which supplies 40 percent of
imports.
What about deflation, then? Is
there a need for a greater effort to
knock the top off the demand boom?
This has been a factor in the rapid
rise in imports and, consequently, the
balance of payments crisis that blew
up when exports income slipped back
a little from its peak. But the most
striking thing about the ridiculously
large rise in spending in New Zealand
in recent years is that the Government’s
own expenditure was leading the
upward rush. Much of its spending
has been ostentatious and unnecessary,
such as on roads and electricity gener-
ating. Some steps have been taken to
halt this.
But the Government,, is being gentle
in applying restraints to its own spend-
ing. “We’re not reducing the total of
Government expenditure but reducing
the rate of increase, so that new capita!
expenditure is being cut back,” is the
official line. It is being a little more
severe on the private sector, but this
is not really tough by our standards.
So far, the recessive measures have
not really bitten all that deep.
Unemployment is still very small even
by our standards, at { percent of the
workforce; import demand is still so
high that there is no likelihood of
import controls being removed within
the next two years (although the
Government hopes that it may be able
to get rid of them soon after that if
its latest measures really do work); it
is still possible to raise money, although
with luck some of the riskier borrowers
may go to the wall; in general the
comfortable life of New Zealanders has
not been very badly disturbed (except
in some specific areas like the Hutt
Valley and so on).
But the importance of the Govern-
ment’s measures should not be mini-
mised; this year’s action has represented
a major and long overdue change in
official economic policy. No longer is the
“she’ll be right on the night” brigade
in charge; now there is a realisation that
New Zealand is no lucky country and
that she will have to rely on more than
luck to get it through. The most strik-
ing change is clearly the decision to
allow unemployment to rise above the
level of 1000 or 0.1 percent of the
workforce (most of whom were per-
sonally known to the authorities) which
had been an article of faith in post-
war New' Zealand governments.
Another striking policy change was
in the spread of the “user pay” prin-
ciple. This meant the end of subsidies on
local food prices (which should have
happened years ago, along with pay-
ing for power capital costs, and so on).
And then there has been a clear move
into more indirect taxes to control con-
sumer spending, particularly on luxuries.
The measures the Government took
last May w'ere a ten percent across the
board cut in bank overdrafts, a rise in
sales tax on motor vehicles from 33 1-3
to 40 percent, a 4d rise in duty on pet-
rol, higher motor vehicle registration
fees, higher duties on cigarettes and
alcohol, and further cuts in import
licences, bringing the total cut to 32
percent in two bites (licensed imports
cover 2-3rds of total private sector im-
ports). All this meant that the Govern-
ment was at last following the advice of
its officials, who had been urging res-
traint for years, but whose advice had
been consistently ignored in the hope
that something would turn up to solve
the problem and it always did. “We
took an optimistic view of the future
against all the advice we were given,”
says Deputy Prime Minister Marshall.
“The wool price fall has made a diffi-
cult but manageable situation doubly
difficult.”

WEEK
Instant Australia
A YOUNG Melbourne man, Brian
Goldsmith, is causing a revolution in
the jaded souvenir industry. First he
brought out the eucalyptus-scented
koala in the can. Next we had the
koala in the billy with a packet of
tea and how to make billy tea in 11
languages. It had such lines as: “Never
scrub billy, just rinse. The older the
billy the better the brew.”
Next he produced the “dig your own
opal.” This was to save the tourist the
tedious business of digging his own
opal in the 115 degrees at Coober Pedy.
He produced a tin of sand with a piece
of opal inside, plus a small spade.
Now Mr. Goldsmith has produced
a small tourist’s LP record with
genuine Australian noises: windmills
pumping, milk bottles being delivered,
rain on a galvanised iron roof, a
mopoke’s call, question time in Can-
berra, and even a Melburnian tram.
Two deeply Australian sounds, in-
credibly, have been overlooked, the
crunch of a one-armed bandit and the
delicious PHUT of a beer can being
opened.
In pursuit
THE IMMIGRATION DEPART-
MENT is already doing its bit to
reduce Post Office losses this financial
year. It is sending post-paid reply regi-
stration forms to all of Australia’s
400,000 resident aliens whose addresses
are known, an innovation “designed to
make registration (under the Aliens
Act) both easier and more effective.”
This, says Immigration Minister Sned-
den, will allow an accurate and up-
to-date register of aliens to be main-
tained. An explanation of why we should
need such a register of aliens is not
given.
Jetting to Moscow
V-JETS IN MOSCOW? Not quite, but
the Australian and Russian Govern-
ments have started negotiations to
establish reciprocal rights for their
international airlines, Qantas and Aero-
flot.
The airlines themselves can say
nothing because discussions are still in
the hands of Government officials, but
if agreement is reached it will probably
take a year at least to get the service
off the ground.
Whether Aeroflot would take advan-
tage of the rights is open to question.
At present they have enough trouble
getting long-range jets to replace prop-
jet services to the U.S.A. Qantas is
more likely to be the benefiting party.
At present the only more-or-less direct
route from Australia to Moscow is by
Air-India, and they haven’t publicised
it much.

stan might find himself without an
available ear for his latest pronounce-
ment.

importance for local newspapers as

Fish business
“HAUTE CUISINE IS DEAD.” The
remark, oddly enough, was made by
Michel Ray, owner of the Ozone Cafe
at Watson’s Bay, which art critic Robert
Hughes described as a microcosm of
Australia. Mr. Ray said those words
over a delicious lunch cooked by him-
self of scallops en brioche farcie, lob-
ster Hunter River (a recipe of his
own), and cherries at Ozone 11, his
new restaurant in Potts Point, awaiting
final official approval before it opens
(he hopes) in the next week or so.
Ozone I is to revert next February
or soon after to its owners, the Doyle
seafood clan, who have had the place
in the family since it started as a shop
nearly 80 years ago. Luckily, the
Doyles, who let Mr. Ray have the cafe
on a 10-year lease in February, 1957,
will continue to run it; there will still
be somewhere to take foreign visitors
and talk convincingly about the Medit-
erranean charm of Sydney.
Mr. Ray told us that he began his
culinary career as a cook on board
Atlantic liners; at the outbreak of
World War II he was stranded aboard
the Pasteur in Nova Scotia, and the
crew had to live off fish caught on
the shores of the rock-bound coast. A
steward, he thereby learned the rigors
of cooking under primitive conditions.
He worked with the Free French in
London, on convoys and finally on
ships ferrying American troops from
Sydney to Guadalcanal in the Pacific
War. After the war, he manufactured
biscuits in Noumea then went into the
cake business in Sydney.
Finally, he took over the Ozone.
Since then, Marlene Dietrich (many
times), Shirley Bassey, Margot Fonteyn,
Vivien Leigh, and many other famous
people have dined there.
Three years ago, Mr. Ray bought an
old house in Rockwall Crescent,
Potts Point the first Sydney book-
maker’s house. “I’ve pulled up floors
and knocked down walls looking for
the hidden money,” Mr. Ray said.
Since then, Mr. Ray had had a bit-
ter battle to get permission to open the
place as a restaurant, and felt at
times that some mysterious force was
against him. He still awaits permission
from the Minister of Local Government.
Ozone II will accommodate 150 people
and will have an ornamental garden, a
roof garden, and private rooms. “We
want to restore the flavor of old Paris
House,” Mr. Ray told us. “The great
restaurant Sydney used to have, in
Phillip Street. A total restaurant,
with every part of the house used for
eating, and a cooking school for 20
pupils upstairs. Of course, we cannot
have haute cuisine. Nobody can pay 50
dollars a head for food here. Haute
cuisine is dead.” But, huddled in over-
coats in the as yet unheated but beauti-
ful Ozone II over our superb lobster
Flunter Valley, we began to wonder if
Mr. Ray was right.

AS I SEE IT
Is Cairns
crossing the
McMahon line?
By ALAN REID
DESPITE THE PRESSURE that is
coming on for a reform of the tariff
system, Trade Minister John McEwen
does not appear to be budging an inch.
Part of the reason for this is the
McEwen approach. McEwen does not
look upon tariff machinery exclusively
as a vehicle to produce economic and
financial results. He looks upon it as a
means of producing jobs and wealth
for Australia.
Without tariff protection of the type
now being provided, jobs would be
fewer, he argues. Without creation of a
sufficient number of jobs, the Austra-
lian immigration program must slow
down even more; Australia’s strength
and prosperity cannot grow at the
dramatic rate it has achieved since
World War 11, and, as a by-product,
there cannot be an equitable distribu-
tion of wealth among Australians with-
out jobs.
Oddly, there is a strange likeness
between his position and that of former
Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell who,
as Minister for Immigration, has left
his greatest monument in the shape of
an Australia that benefited in wealth,
growth rate, cultural enrichment, and
population increase from his immigra-
tion drive.
Calwell was probably the only person
who could have persuaded the Austra-
lian Labor Party and the Australian
trade-union movement, both tradition-
ally suspicious of the migrant, to accept
at that point in Australia’s history a
migration drive of such immensity and
imagination.
McEwen is probably the only person
in Australian politics with the stature
and prestige to persuade his own
Country Party and bucolic followers,
as suspicious of his high tariff policy as
Calwell’s Labor was of his, to accept a
tariff system behind which burgeon new
Australian industries of a range and
complexity that only a short time be-
fore were believed beyond Australian
capacity and ingenuity.
McEwen has certainly run into
trouble on his tariff policy. The
Treasury does not like it. Their yard-
stick is efficiency rather than the social
element. Woolgrowers, feeling the pinch
of falling prices now, have grown aware
of the line that McEwen is following,
and a section of them do not like it.
Their yardstick could even turn out,
if prices fall further, to be the harsh
one of survival. The Labor Party, or
at least some sections of it, do not like
it.
Strangely, McEwen is closer to the
traditional Labor policy that jobs are
more important than the economic
and financial factors than are some of
his Labor critics.
The approach of Opposition Leader
Gough Whitlam on this subject is com-
paratively shallow. He equates tariff
concessions to Australian manufac-
turers with contributions to McEwen
House, the proposed Country Party
headquarters in Canberra.
It is an easy, convenient, but cer-
tainly unjustified smear which saves
the trouble of thinking the very com-
plex tariff problem through to a more
rational conclusion.
Dr. Jim Cairns, the Victorian who is
Labor’s shadow Trade Minister, is the
one who appears to have done the
most thinking on this subject. He starts
off with the advantage that Labor
policy on this subject is very loose.
The section in Labor’s platform
reads “effective tariff protection of
Australian industries and import em-
bargoes in favor of Australian industries
capable of supplying the home market
in each case subject to control of
prices, to protection of Australian work-
ing conditions, and to due efficiency in
production.” The looseness of this
wording has enabled Cairns to develop
a thesis that has outraged those Labor
traditionalists whose thinking is closer
to McEwen’s, and who believe with
McEwen that jobs and the advantages
that flow from the provision of jobs is
all-important, since it is the human
factor in tariff policymaking that out-
weighs all other considerations.
Cairns, an economist in his own
right, has just put out a paper which
shows that he has given considerable
and anxious thought to this question
of tariff policy. Basically, he comes out
against McEwen, whom he accuses of
seeking such a high general level of
tariffs that inefficiency would be widely
encouraged in the economy. Cairns
claims that he does not go as far as
Treasurer William McMahon, whom he
accuses (without producing any con-
vincing evidence) of seeking to reduce
tariffs on a scale that would produce
significant unemployment and capital
losses.
Whether intentionally or not, Cairns
leaves the impression that he is much
closer to what he describes, possibly
without justification, as the McMahon
line of lower tariffs, coupled with
greater efficiency, even if it means the
extinction of quite significant Austra-
lian industries.
Writes Cairns: “The ALP does not
believe that every industry that seeks
protection should be granted it . . .
There is a strong feeling not only that
important sectors of the Australian
economy are not economic and effi-
cient, but that the Tariff Board has
done little in recent years to induce
better economy and more efficiency.
The Board’s report on the chemical
industry, for example, leaves an indel-
ible impression that the industry is not
economic . . . the Tariff Board hopes
that the Australian market will grow
fast enough to make the industry
economic. But a better way to achieve
an economic industry may be to
reduce the number of firms in the
industry.”
Cairns complains in his paper that
the Tariff Board between January, 1965,
and April, 1967, dealt with industries
employing only about 140,000 people
(the chemical industry was one of
them).
“What about all the other tariff-
protected industries?” Cairns asks.
“May it not be that protected by those
tariffs there may be industries that are
not economic and efficient.”
Whatever the economic value of his
argument, Cairns does not seem to
realise the blind alley that he is run-
ning into politically on this issue.
“It is beyond doubt that much of
Australian industry is not very com-
petitive,” Cairns writes. “More com-
petition cannot be introduced in the
old ways because this -would damage
investment and employment too much
and suddenly. Instead, we must use the
Tariff Board to ascertain those changes
in organisation structure and methods
which will produce greater efficiency
and then lead or induce those changes
by tariff policy and by other appropri-
ate measures.”
As Cairns has complained that, in
just over two years, the Tariff Board
dealt without sufficient realism (in the
chemical industries case, at any rate)
with industries involving the jobs of
140,000 workers, the clear implication
of what he is saying is that he wants
the Tariff Board to deal realistically
with industries involving the jobs of
hundreds of thousands of workers.
Against that background, McEwen is
clearly quite cheerfully digging in his
toes. He is going to pursue his policy,
and politically you cannot blame him.
Cairns might have the economic
logic on his side, but if the crunch ever
comes on this issue, McEwen is in a
politically unassailable position. He can
point out that he is protecting the jobs
of hundreds of thousands of Austra-
lians, and, in his view, the future con-
tinued growth of Australia and the
Australian economy.

How could he be safer than you?
Well, take a look at the “tread” on his tyre.
It grips the wire, gives him the necessary stability

So how about taking a critical look at the tread on

AUSTRALIA
Gently loosening another of
the links with Britain
ANNOUNCING HIS decision to exer-
cise the Government’s power in limit-
ing appeals from the High Court to the
Privy Council, Attorney-General Bowen
explained that this was “consistent with
the growth of Australia as an indepen-
dent nation.” It was this statement
with its implication of gently loosening
another of the links with the Mother
Country which focused attention on
the role the Council has played since
Federation in Australian Law. In num-
bers of cases it has not been so impres-
sive, but it seems significant that over
the past decade or so, the yearly quota
of disputes which have made that costly
trek to London has gradually risen.
In the past few years, the Privy
Council has heard such appeals as the
Ipec-Civil Aviation case, the Marrick-
ville Holdings (margarine)-N.S.W.
Government petition, the “Border
Hopping” case (now a query in inter-
state cement haulage), and the appeal
against the execution sentence on
Ronald Joseph Ryan. All these actions
were eventually dismissed and in fact
very few recent appeals have been
upheld by the Council.
The legal technicalities of the
Attorney-General’s decision are in them-
selves interesting. Falling under Section
74 of the Constitution, the matter will
most probably involve an amendment
to the Judiciary Act. Ironically, this is
one of the few sections under which
any intended changes must be reserved
by the Governor-General for the
pleasure of the Queen. As in this case
she would be advised by the Governor-
General (who is in turn advised by
Cabinet), the amendment when passed
is sure of having an untroubled final
ratification.
An appeal before the Privy Council
is an expensive affair and for a
“colonial” Q.C. to land a London brief
is to pull off the jackpot of his pro-
fession. In a Federal case, this will not
only involve the barrister representing
and his junior counsel, but also separate
barristers from the States who invari-
ably seek leave for representation before
Council. Appeals tend to drag on and
total costs have been known to exceed
the $200,000 mark. In the larger Federal
hearings, the Q.C. can expect fees of up
to $BOOO.
Canada (in 1949), India, and Pakis-
tan have already abolished appeals to
the Privy Council. With Australia now
certain to follow suit, the number of
constitutional links with Great Britain
seems likely to suffer further pruning.
What is left? We still have an ensign
and not a national flag; we still stand up
to the British anthem, not our own;
our officers are commissioned by the
Queen; our countrymen receive their
honors from London; our head of state
lives 13,000 miles away. However, even
if these relics of colonialism finally pass
into extinction, it seems likely that Aus-
tralian barristers and judges will still
be wearing their 18th-century wigs.
Liberal Party
Facing up
THE PRIME MINISTER brandished
a copy of Labor’s new policy with a
striking black-and-white cover portrait
of Gough Whitlam. “It’s just a new suit
on an old carcass,” Mr. Holt said,
waving Mr. Whitlam’s portrait in the
air. The 54 Liberal members gathered
in Canberra for the 22nd annual confer-
ence of the Party’s Federal Council
roared their approval.
But although the Liberals could
afford a laugh at Labor’s “new suit,”
many of them believed that their own
suit could do with a little patching.
And the Liberal suit had frayed the
most on a subject to do with the
Federal Council.
The Party officials were very touchy
about unfavorable comparisons between
Federal Council and Labor’s notorious
Federal Conference. Both Mr. Holt and
the Liberal Party president, Brigadier
Jock Pagan, went out of their way to
stress that Labor’s new conference was
still “the 36 faceless men plus the
chosen 11.”
In a statement headed, “We don’t
give orders,” Pagan declared that the
Liberal Federal Council was not a
council of Party bosses. “The public is
entitled to know the position, because
one or two printed comments I have
seen in recent days don’t state the facts,”
he said with a stony glance at the
assembled Pressmen.
“If we reach conclusions about Fed-
eral policy, we send them to the Gov-
ernment as recommendations —we
don’t give orders to the Government.”
What Brigadier Pagan said is of
course quite true. Only two days after
the Council meeting, the Holt Govern-
ment ignored Council’s rejection of a
motion to abolish appeals from Aus-
tralian courts to the Privy Council,
and abolished appeals on Federal mat-
ters.
But, stripped of the ballyhoo, there
are some remarkable similarities be-
tween the Liberal Federal Council and
Labor’s Federal Conference. Both are
constituted on a State-equality basis.
The Liberals have eight delegates from
each State, and Labor seven.
The Liberal Council is just as “face-
less” as the Labor Conference and only
a sprinkling of the delegates at last
week’s meeting were known “faces,”
such as politicians. (The Liberal Party
Pagan (left) and PM. . .. don’t give orders


rules specifically state that politicians
on the Federal Council must be in the
minority.)
And both are described as the “Gov-
erning body” of their respective Party.
The real differences between the two
bodies is that the Labor Conference
decides actual policy for the Party
while the Liberal Council does not, and
that the Labor Conference is open to
the public while the Liberal Council
is not.
The Liberals were rnost sensitive to
criticism of their closed Council and
to any suggestions that the Labor
Party’s deliberations were now more
democratic. If, as observers asked, the
Council is only an advisory body, why
not open it to the Press and public?
The Prime Minister showed he was
receptive to this argument. Three days
after the Council meeting he told
Parliament that there was nothing in-
herently permanent in the closed-shop
discussions of the Liberal Party.
“I believe there is something to be
said for holding these meetings in public
rather than have distorted versions
getting out to the Press,” he said.
With Holt’s backing for open dis-
cussions it seems that the controversy
over the Liberal Council versus Labor
Conference is likely to go a few more
rounds.
Parliament
Poor estimates
“HOW POORLY OFF I AM,” com-
plained Liberal backbencher Richard
Cleaver to sympathetic colleagues in
the House of Representatives, “When
my secretary is due for her leave I have
to do the work personally, pay for a
relief secretary, or call on my wife to
meet the emergency.”
Mr. Cleaver was airing his grievances
in the an'nual debate on the parliamen-
tary estimates ($3,940,000 this financial
year), in which Federal members take
a long look at the institution of Parlia-
ment.
Nobody seemed particularly happy
with what they saw. Members com-
plained of everything from lack of
secretarial and research staff to the
diminishing role of Parliament itself.
Donald Cameron, the 27-year-old
new Liberal member for Griffith, in
Queensland, weighed into the debate
carrying a two-foot-high stack of de-
partmental reports. “It is almost impos-
sible to read one-quarter of what we
receive,” Cameron said, claiming that
parliamentarians needed assistance from
research workers.
Mr. Jeff Bate (the member for
Macarthur) urged that Parliament be
moved from “this bush capital” to the
outback. “We sit here smugly and corn-
Bate ... expenses
Scholes ... words
placently in Canberra, in the south-
east corner of the country,” he said.
“The real Australia is out in the hot
white light, -in the great expanses of
this country.”
Mr. Gordon Scholes, the new member
for Corio, expressed surprise at the
language used in Parliament. Members,
he said, had been accusing other mem-
bers of being traitors and of having
treasonous intentions.
“These words should not be used
lightly, and should not become part of
the daily language of the Parliament.”
Mr. H. B. Turner, an advocate for
parliamentary reform, admitted that
Government backbenchers were in a
dilemma. They could not participate
in the framing of policy, as this was
done by the Ministers and the bureau-
crats, nor could they oppose the Gov-
ernment. They, therefore, became
merely voting members who supported
the Government on all occasions
whether right or wrong.
But members’ biggest headache
lack of facilities will not be solved
until a new Parliament House is built.
The present building was opened in
1927 as a temporary home.
The Government’s idea is to build a
new Parliament House on the shores of
Canberra’s Lake Burley Griffin, and
Mr. Cleaver seemed to air the exasper-
ation of most members when he said,
“I wonder how long it will be before
we see plans.”
Erosion
Pressures
A RECURRING CYCLE of low-
pressure weather troughs can be blamed
for the storms which have lashed the
east coast of Australia this winter, eat-
ing huge hunks out of some famous
beaches and gouging out the founda-
tions of buildings built much too near
the beachfronts.
Since 1870 there have been four or
five such “low” periods. Nobody knows
their exact cause, but all the experts
say the erosion will stop.
One expert, Dr. D. Brannigan, a
Senior Lecturer in Geology at the Uni-
versity of Sydney, points out that on
the whole the coastline is increasing,
not disappearing, as delta areas form
round river entrances and lagoons bank
up with sand.
Explaining the pattern of the storms,
Mr. J. Johnston, Regional Director for
N.S.W. at the Sydney Weather Bureau,
said that the low-pressure troughs occur
in both winter and summer, but it is
only when the trough remains for
longer than a day or two that the
vicious seas are whipped up.
The larger-than-usual waves have
combined with the extra-high king
tides which happen at this time of year
because of the conjunction of the sun
and moon.
The high waves then pound the coast
and wash away the sand too fast for
it to run back after the wave has struck.
The trouble occurred first in Queens-
land, especially on the Gold Coast.
Now the lows have moved south down
the N.S.W. coast.
“There always seems to be extra-dry
weather in Victoria and Tasmania
when we get these low troughs and
storms,” Mr. Johnston said. “But we
can’t be sure yet that there is any
direct link.”
The erosion damage appears more
drastic on “developed” beaches like
Sydney’s Collaroy and Manly, and
Surfers Paradise.
The construction of artificial sea-
walls backing many of these beaches
has added to the trouble. Natural dunes
are necessary if a beach is to continue
to replenish the sand which is continu-
ally ebbing and flowing from the shore
to offshore sandbars.
Much research is being done into
causes and cures for beach erosion. At
the University of N.S.W. Water
Research Laboratory at Manly Vale,
Sydney, Mr. D. N. Foster, Senior
Lecturer in Civil Engineering, stipulated
two lines of action:
Short-term sea-walls to bastion the
houses which are in present peril from
the sea; long-term, positive action, with
a policy of “beach nourishment,”
replenishing hungry beaches with new
sand.
Mr. Foster pointed to almost ident-
ical damage to Collaroy and Manly last
time the “lows” sat put. The damaged
beaches all recovered in time.

Interstate trade
Un-cementing
N.S.W. PREMIER ASKIN drew some
sharp comment from Tasmania last
week when he told Ready Mixed Con-
crete that he might stipulate that only
N.S.W. cement must be used on Gov-
ernment contracts.
This was a move against RMC’s im-
portation of much cheaper Goliath
cement from Railton, in Tasmania;
only six percent of RMC’s require-
ments at present, but Mr. Askin’s aim
was “to discourage increases that could
have crippling effects” on the N.S.W.
cement industry.
Tasmania’s protests, with mention of
interstate trade, Section 92 (probably
not applicable), and some vague
references to reprisals, were met with
a firm statement (although with
piteous undertones) that the Tasmanian
firm had the advantages of sea trans-
port “which is cheaper than rail” and
“our comparatively low port charges.’.’
The N.S.W. statement followed two
years of investigation by a govern-
mental committee headed by the
director of the Department of Decen-
tralisation and Development, Mr. W. A.
Butterfield. The immediate concern,
said N.S.W. Premier Askin, was the long-
term implication for decentralisation
of industry and the possible crippling
of the State’s s2om. a year cement in-
dustry.
A spokesman for the Blue Circle
group, which claims to have already
lost business to Goliath, attacked
RMC’s arrangement with that com-
pany. “The serious aspect,” he said,
“is the direct link between a manu-
facturer and a particular user and the
danger that it will be the prelude to
a situation which has developed in the
U.S., where vertical integration be-
tween the concrete premix industry
and the cement industry is far ad-
vanced and neither industry appears to
be in a healthy state.”
All this seemed beyond the essential
point that competition begets efficiency
both in the ready-mix and cement-
concrete sectors of the industry, and
that efficiency in both rebounds to
the consumer’s benefit. There is no
question of the RMC-Goliath agree-
ment being a horizontal type of line-up
and as such holding dangers for end
prices in the industry which are hot
implicit in vertical line-ups.
There is more in the Blue Circle
spokesman’s second charge, that local
CN.S.W. producers should not be sub-
ject to cut-price competition from out-
side the State and, lest unemploy-
ment spread and the industry’s de-
velopment in the State be retarded,
the Premier would seem to have in
this a sound reason for his action. This
seems true even if such competition
would lead to increased efficiency.
Premier Askin ... sound reason

"Togetherness"
IN FEW SMALL towns in Australia
would “togetherness” have kept 250
men idle for three months. In Collins-
ville, Queensland, when the men strike
or are dismissed, they stick together and
the women have always been right
behind the men and sometimes even
in front of them in the picket line. And
the town, with a population which has
never risen much over the 2000 mark,
has never had much option but to
string along with them, too.
Collinsville, named for Labor M.P.
Charles Collins (elected for Burke and
Bowen in 1909; died 1936), is 770 miles
north of Brisbane. Although a Labor
man gave it its name, the town is politic-
ally noteworthy mainly for the solid
support its miners gave to help Com-
munist Fred Paterson into State Parlia-
ment in the 19505,
From 1919 to 1961, the State Coal
Mine was the town’s main employer.
Over the years, the cost to the Treasury
of running it was estimated at a debit of
$1,400,000. In 1952, 120 men stayed
down the mine for nine days (at a cost
to themselves of $BOOO in wages) over
an issue involving something like $6O
and the women approved,
In 1954, national sympathy was with
the town when seven men died in the
mine from poisonous carbon-dioxide
gas. A Royal Commission followed.
In February, 1961, there was a three
weeks’ mine strike. Later, it was decided
to close the State mine. In May, 25 cars
of Collinsville miners drove to Bris-
bane in convoy to campaign for a re-
opening. In September of the same year
the mine was sold.
This year Collinsville has had its
most extraordinary three months, be-
ginning with a stopwork on a new
Powerhouse construction project on
June 6, moving toward an attempt at
strike-breaking by nearly 50 men said
to be AWU members but simple
“industrial renegades” to Collinsville.
Eventually, after fights in barracks
being shared by dismissed project
workers and some of the strike-breakers,
unions and management came to an
agreement two weeks ago and the
trouble seemed over. Early last week
both dismissed workers still in Collins-
ville and “renegades” were to have been
signed on for a new start.
Then, singly and in batches, the
“renegades” were set on and literally
chased out of town, except for five in
hospital. The local police force, in-
creased from a normal four to 16, did
not intervene.
Meanwhile, in Brisbane three State
Industrial Commissioners held a com-
pulsory conference and ordered the
contractors, John Holland and Co., to
reopen the job. One Commissioner said
he would visit Collinsville to “assist
in any way to settle any local problem.”
A Queensland Employers’ Federation
director commented sharply on the
equanimity with which “intolerance, in-
humanity, and brutality” had been
accepted almost without rebuke.
That was another view of “together-
ness,” Collinsville style.
Western Australia
The Base
THE PROBLEMS OF the Australian
construction colossus Concrete Indus-
tries (Monier) Ltd. over payments of
moneys from the U.S.A. for construc-
tion of the newest and in many
ways the most significant edifice yet
created in this country to the all-
important Australian-American alliance
have gone with Harold Holt this week
when he began a trans-continental
trip (by VIP aircraft) to officially open
the Exmouth Gulf U.S. Navy Base
next Saturday.
Members of the parliamentary Press
Gallery accompanying Mr. Holt on his
travels to the North West Cape com-
plex and the little village of Exmouth
received individual well-stuffed manila
envelopes last week.
The roneoed information inside spelt
out in clear detail Monier’s difficulties
in squeezing money out of the U.S.
Navy for work on the huge $U.5.34.8
million communications complex, and
Monier’s present unenviable position,
face to face with at least a SA6 million
loss on the project.
None of this added much to any-
one’s knowledge, and is certainly not
likely to make the Prime Minister
deviate from the traditional flow of
“opening” platitudes on Saturday.
But it would be only human for
him to have some private reflections
on Monier’s troubles as he looks over
the 13 steel towers the heart of
the complex. Undoubtedly, one of the
things to be considered and feared is
the blow Monier experience in this
major Australian-American project has
dealt to future joint ventures between
Australian and American contractors.


Brisbane
Valley Venuses
BRISBANE MAY have been a
striking city in many ways last week,
but it seems doomed to failure in
trying to compete with Gold Coast
glitter. In fact, an attempt to introduce
gold-suited hostesses to hand out change
for a new five-cent-fare shuttle-bus
service between the City and nearby
Valley helped trigger off a bus-tram
stoppage on Monday of last week.
The Brisbane Tramways Union,
which has had a trying time recently
as trams have been literally burnt up
in the gradual City Council change-
over from trams to buses, saw the
cheaper fare, extra shopping bus ser-
vice as a threat to 10-cent-priced trams
on the same route. The Valley Venuses,
who were to dispense change at pick-
up stops, were seen as a non-union-
labor threat.
The golden girls were a publicity
gimmick thought up by the Valley
Business Council and after the strike
the businessmen decided to give up the
idea. Gold suits, gold caps, and gold
boots were put into cold storage. And
the girls? They were members of the
Shop Assistants’ Union and are back on
their usual shop-assisting jobs in
Valley stores.
Road, deaths
Black band
WESTERN AUSTRALIA IS looking
into ways of weeding out potential
killer-drivers by psychological testing.
Such a move would create a tremen-
dous outcry from angry parents of 17-
year-olds, no doubt, but the Minister
for Traffic, Mr. Craig, regards the
problem seriously enough to have ap-
pointed a top-level committee to inves-
tigate it. And the five men already
have some strong arguments to back
measures they may recommend.
The most startling of these is a
graph showing the male mortality
rate with its telling hump in the
15-22 age-group. A Perth doctor who
has been concerned officially with this
“black band” believes this is a problem
that has not yet begun to be faced.
It should be treated as an epidemic,
he maintains. “In all other age groups
male and female death rates run almost
parallel. I can’t see how this 15 to 25
rise can be caused by anything other
than accidents most of them road
accidents.
“We’ve managed to decrease the
death-toll in every other area, and
expectation of life is increasing
steadily. But the deathrate of males
between 15 and 25 is rising uncon-
trollably, and we watch it rise, im-
potently, year by year. I feel it is
because many young men need to live
adventurously. This need is often sat-
isfied by sports with an element of
danger skindiving, surfing, drag
racing, even Rugby and Australian
Rules. Others need to take it out on
their cars. Surely we can devise a
personality test computerised if
need be to eliminate those likely to
use their cars the wrong way.”
H. G. Wells suggested that nations
to come might need specially created
danger areas, where young men, de-
prived of the tribal proofs of manhood
like hunting and fighting, could prove
themselves men by artificial means . . .
even at the risk of occasionally killing
themselves. Western society has just
such an arena —but on these roads
the proving ground often claims not
only the man under test but the inno-
cent.
Norfolk Is.
Showdown
TROUBLE HAS BROKEN out in
paradise 1035 miles east-nor’-east
from Sydney at Norfolk Island. Reports
filtering across the troubled waters
chewing pieces out of Sydney’s fore-
shores and on into Canberra last week
indicated a “showdown” was imminent
between the Island Administrator Marsh
and the local populace.
Reports reaching Canberra early in
the week carrying threats of Mr.
Marsh’s pending resignation were fol-
lowed by new reports at the end of the
week that he had resigned.
It is doubtful whether the operative
word should be “resigned” or “retired,”
as Mr. Marsh’s two-year period as
Administrator was drawing to a close.
His trouble with the local population
is the direct result of the island’s main
industry, tourism not because too
few tourists are arriving but simply
that not enough are leaving.
The island’s population, 1152 at the
last count, are extremely upset by their
unwanted settlers, particularly the
“opportunists,” who come to Norfolk
on holiday, gauge its potential pickings
from the tourists, set up shop in opposi-
tion to the locals, and then depart
again when they have harvested some
of the best pickings from the seasonal
tourist crop.
The people’s body on Norfolk
Island, the Island Council, has been
pressurising Mr. Marsh, the Council
ex-officio chairman, to put a stop to
this practice.
They went over his head last week
and asked Federal Territories Minister
Barnes to come to the island himself
or appoint a parliamentary committee
to look into their problems.
Mr. Barnes has done neither. Instead,
he has revealed he has taken steps to
hurry along the preparation of new
legislation to stop people staying on the
island. He hopes to introduce it into
Federal Parliament in the current
session.
New Zealand
D-day
NEXT SATURDAY, September 23,
New Zealanders will vote in a non-
compulsory referendum on liquor
licensing hours. In the last one, in 1949,
the vote was 470,000 for six o’clock
closing and 150,000 for 10 o’clock.
No wonder N.Z. Attorney-General
Hanan has asked every eligible person
to vote this time, saying that a poor
response to the poll would be a great
misfortune, whichever way it might go
forwards or backwards.
For if the vote favors a changeover,
it will not be the first time in New
Zealand for a night sale of liquor in
hotels to the public.
In 1842, hours were fixed at 6 a.m. to
10 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. to
7 p.m. on Sundays. The licensing jus-
tices could grant an extension to mid-
night. Sunday opening has been pro-
hibited since 1881. The midnight ex-
tension was altered to 11 p.m. in 1893
and abolished in 1910. Six o’clock clos-
ing, which \yas introduced as a war
measure in 1917, was made permanent
in 1918.
The poll decision, as in 1949, still
rests between 6 and 10 p.m., with a
provision that local conditions might,
even if 10 p.m. is carried this time, call
for an earlier closing hour. There will
be no provision for a meal break.
If a change is adopted, the drinking
hours will not exceed 11 hours in one
day, as against nine hours at present.
Temperance groups are against any
extension of drinking hours and the
campaign theme of the New Zealand
Alliance is “Stick to Six” on D-Day.
The Public and Social Affairs Com-
mittee of the Anglican Church of New
Zealand says if extension beyond six
p.m. is approved, it is not obvious
that more liquor would be consumed
in total, and certainly drinking would
take place in a more civilised manner.
The Presbyterian Church’s Commit-
tee on Liquor Problems approves of
later closing and points out that in
Victoria, following later closing, there
were fewer drunken drivers and
pedestrians on the road and fewer
drunken parties.
Chief-Inspector B. W. Gibson, of the
national police headquarters, who
attended a course for senior officers
at Manly, Sydney, said on return that
Australia’s licensing laws are far
healthier than those in New Zealand.


COMMENT
How to give ourselves a greater
sense of self-importance
THE SWIFTNESS with which Mr. Holt reacted
to the news of the British pull out from Malaysia
and Singapore has created instant reactions in South-
East Asia of the kind that have now become associ-
ated with his dynamic policy toward' our neighbors.
There was immediate praise of his offer to Malaysia
and Singapore of six Australian battalions and a
squadron of Phantom bombers. As Mr. Holt pointed
out, with only three of our 20 battalions in Vietnam,
it is good for training, as well as neighborliness, that
other Australian battalions should have a spell of
service overseas. There was particular praise, in
South-East Asian comment, for Mr. Holt’s statement
that the role of Australian defence aid to Malaysia
and Singapore should be carefully defined so that
it did not conflict with the achievement of Aus-
tralia’s final objective: the establishment of an
Oceanic Alliance between Australia, New Zealand,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia,
aimed at the mutual security of all six nations. The
speed of Mr. Holt’s announcement was compared
with the way in which, some time ago, the Aus-
tralian Government initiated special aid to the new
Indonesian Government, with a grant of $l5 million.
There has also been comment on how, as a result
of its continuing policy for the Armed Services, carried
on throughout the 1950 s and 19605. Australia has
established itself as the principal military and eco-
nomic strategic power in its own region.
•
None of this has happened, of course. In fact, all
that happened last week was that Mr. Holt told the
Liberal Party Federal Council in Canberra that Aus-
tralia was not going to be self-reliant in his lifetime,
or in the lifetime of any member of his audience.
Yet Australia is a nation which produces each year
about three times the wealth that Indonesia pro-
duces, and, for that matter, almost half the wealth
that India produces in a year. In a global sense
Australia might not be self-reliant. But at least in
a regional sense the Government should accept self-
reliance as an immediate national objective.
We have engaged in our first paragraph fantasy
of what Australia might now be doing if it had
emerged from its post-colonial lethargy earlier to
dramatise our cover story, written by an Australian
military expert, on Australian defence policy. We do
not necessarily endorse all of his findings they are
simply put forward to encourage discussion but
the truth of one of them seems inescapable when
he says that “it is in the use of armed forces as a
means of providing muscle and weight in diplomatic
manoeuvres that Australia is particularly inexperi-
enced.” We are still doe-eyed with the idea of
ourselves as the little brother of some great ally so
that all we have to do is to bring our defence
expenditure up to the point -that makes a great
ally remain faithful to us and be able to supplement
his armed forces if he is engaged in some action in
which he requires our co-operation. Behind this, as
our contributor puts it, is an obsession with a policy
for our Armed Services that imagines only clashes
between great powers and that envisages massive
slaughter.
What Australians do not allow for are the little
wars that are more usual in the history of conflict or,
even more important, the sense of strength and
importance that can be given to a nation by its
armed strength (and, one might add, its economic
strength) even when that strength does not have to
be used. If we are to play a role in our own neighbor-
hood our options will be very greatly widened if we
learn how to deploy some of our prosperity into
armed strength, and some of it into economic
manoeuvrability. If we do not learn how to act like
a strong power, diplomacy can do little more for ,us
than provide a few fair-weather friendships. Nice
chaps, the Australians, but they don’t amount to
much.
The possibility for Australia to act with initiative
and independence in its own region is enormous.
The main limitation lies within the imaginations
of those who rule Australia. Either they see them-
selves as the leaders of a self-reliant nation, guided
by self-confident principles; or they fall back and
cringe with an infantile provincialism.




DEFEND AUSTR ALIA - WHERE?
BY A CMF OFFICER
IT’S A WONDER we got away with
it for so long. From Federation to
World War 11, Australia’s armed
forces were an appendage of British
Empire defence: similarly, our foreign
policy expressed not our efforts to
shape a future as a Pacific nation but
rather to do nothing to cut the
imperial umbilical cord. Provincialism,
always close to the surface of the Aus-
tralian character, ran riot. We did not
have to stir ourselves to think about
anything beyond our sea frontiers.
Even allowing for the benefit of
hindsight, one can only look with
amazement on the dream-time of the
’thirties . . . economic stagnation at
home, matched by blissful ignorance
of the plainly expressed intentions of
Japan. As a small boy in the late
’thirties I can remember being terrified
of a Japanese invasion ... I assume I
received my lurid thought pictures
from the adult world. If this was what
the adult world was thinking, why on
earth didn’t they take some steps to
counter it? I imagine the answer lies
somewhere in the colonial mentality
. . . that when nagging worries about
the Japs, Yellow Peril, etc., came up,
the adults, voters and politicians alike,
were able to find refuge in the myth of
imperial defence and safe return to the
contemplation of starters and riders
at Flemington.
When our moment of truth came
after the fall of Singapore and Prime
Minister Curtin sought aid from the
United States, the interesting thing was
not that we were swopping father
figures but that we were able to do it
without embarrassment. In fact, there
was. even a sense of outrage that our
late protector had let us down. Pro-
tection was our natural right.
Yet the post-war generation has not
done any better. If, with the British
pull-out from South-East Asia, the
colonial period is finally about to end,
it’s not because of any initiative on our
part but rather that events have finally-
caught up with us. While Britain
fought a long counter-insurgency cam-
paign in Malaya—ultimately in our
interest employing 100,000 soldiers
before she won it, and while the U.S.
partially mobilised for the Korean
war, we again got by with the absolute
minimum defence establishment. This
hiatus in defence was explained .in
economic terms: that during this period
we maintained one of the highest
investment levels in the Western world.
Whether this was in fact a masterly
piece of real politik or a carryover
of ’thirties attitudes —which conceived
wars as things fought between big
powers somewhere else —is not certain.
But the fact remains that during this
period our armed forces lapsed into a
state of unpreparedness which they are
only now beginning to recover from.
The average Australian is more
interested in defence than many poli-
ticians give him credit for. This is
not to say that he is more interested
in defence than in his suburban pur-
suits or his sporting contests but that
behind his political attitudes, whether
left or right, is the instinctive feeling
that the future for Australia in the
years ahead may not be absolutely
guaranteed. In fact, a political leader
who could learn how to channel this
underlying concern about national
security would probably be in for a
long term of office. The electorate
was able to swallow the precedent-
began to react to the Vietnam require-
ments as if the whole thing had sud-
denly sneaked up on us. Say the
British had left South-East Asia before
Sukarno began his Confrontation.
Would we have stood by and watched
Malaysia go down the drain? Or,
even if we had wanted to counter the
threat as skilfully as the British, what
forces would we have had to do it
with?
Another symptom of our dependency
is that, although it is quite obvious
that we are not a super-power and that
therefore our ability to control external
happenings is limited, we do not recog-
nise that it is no longer true to say that
we can have no influence whatsoever
on events in our corner of the world.
We are a wealthy, industrially strong,
and socially successful nation. We have
much to give our underdeveloped
"Whatever happens in the
next ten years we will be for
the first time largely on our
own in our corner of Asia"
breaking decision to conscript 20-year-
olds and send them off to a war which,
to say the least, is not universally
popular, because most of us, if offered
a choice between positive and negative
defence proposals, will generally choose
the positive.
As we tremble on the brink of the
uncertain ’seventies, having had
Britannia’s last skirt whipped away
from in front of us, only one thing is
certain. Whatever happens in the next
ten years we will be for the first time
largely on our own in our corner of
Asia. With the U.S. attention focused
farther north and the U.K. withdraw-
ing we will have to bear the respon-
sibilities for our own defence and
foreign policies when we actually
evolve them. Yet we still show many of
the symptoms of dependency. One
of the greatest of these symptoms is
that we still see wars, alarums, and
excursions as occurring somewhere
else, and with action sufficiently
delayed for us to have time to do
something about it after the event.
In World Wars I and II we raised
large volunteer forces when the war
began. In 1942, after the Japanese
invasion seemed imminent, we got
around to thinking about conscrip-
tion. Lately, after allowing the defence
forces to exist in semi-poverty, we
neighbors in the way of technical as-
sistance and training ... and we can
give it in an Australian way, which is
often better suited to Asian susceptibili-
ties than other, more massive efforts. We
are not, despite the record, automati-
cally equated with the “imperialists” by
many Asians. It may be that the time
is now to mobilise our resources, diplo-
matic, technical, and military, to bring
our influences to bear on our part of
Asia and have a clear voice in the
future of the area. History has cer-
tainly provided us with the opportunity.
In a clash of two super-powers such
as the U.S. and China we can only
be very small beer. We must take such
a possibility into account in our defence
planning. But we should primarily con-
sider the role we can play in the part
of the world closest *to us. What is
most important for us is to stop think-
ing automatically of war as conflicts
like World Wars I and 11. These two
near Armageddons were exceptions,
or rather aberrations, in the history of
warfare. The great majority of wars
have been minor conflicts fought for
limited ends. It’s as well that we can
still recall the massive slaughter of the
two recent super wars as a remindei
of what happens when national policy
or diplomacy runs off the rails when
ends are confused with means. The
sort of challenges which are likely to
face us in the future are not of this
magnitude; rather they will resemble
the 40 or so small wars fought since
1945. From this point of view it is
worth considering in detail the way the
British replied to Sukarno’s Confronta-
tion. Their actions were a classic ex-
ample of the use of force to achieve
limited military aims. In their last mili-
tary act in our part of the world, the
British left a lesson for us and the rest
of the world in the correct response to
a limited threat.
After the Indonesians attacked in
Borneo and made raids on Malaysia
itself, it would have been possible for
British air and sea power to reply by
bombing the main cities in Java, des-
troying internal communications, wip-
ing out internal sea traffic. This would
have caused the Indonesian Army to
wither on the vine for lack of supplies.
Wisely, this course was rejected, for,
although this response would have been
militarily easier, long-term chances of
a settlement would have been impos-
sible. Bombing (inevitably of civilians)
increases the psychological heat of a
conflict by putting civilians into the
front line. In the short but bloody his-
tory of “strategic” bombing the result
has always been the opposite of that
intended. The will of the civilian popu-
lation has always been strengthened, not
sapped. To an authoritarian ruler bomb-
ing can be a gift, for the enemy can
be seen by all to be as “evil” as the
State propaganda has always claimed
Further civilian casualties add fuel to
the fires of hate and make a sane
settlement harder than ever to achieve
Had the British bombed Indonesia
one wonders if Sukarno and the PKI
wou ld now be discredited,
In Borneo itself, the British had two
alternatives: one was to dig in to
defend the frontier and virtually wait
to be attacked; the other was to in-
vade the Indonesian side to destroy his
Army and cut his communications. For-
tunately, they chose the first altern-
ative, though this was militarily less
satisfying. It was important that the
Indonesian Army should not be crush-
defeated. The Army was the only
organised group with the strength and
1° cou . n^e , 1 r Communists within
the .. S,ate " sel , f - Had “ , been ' rushed
”,,“ s ”° *e communist
coup may well have succeeded. The
Britishi like experienced la coun .
tered eve ry bid with the minimum card
needed to take the trick. While fight-
ing the war they were thinking settle-
ment for the true aim of war is
peace and military action, though a
last resort, is, or should be, a rational
act. Total victory can never be the
object only a negotiation which
enables both sides to inhabit the same
planet. Crushing defeat of the enemy
robs us of the fruits of victory by
practically guaranteeing revenge at a
future date. Fortunately, the British
have left us an Indonesia with its
basic dignity intact and few scores to
settle.
It is in the use of armed forces as
a means of providing muscle and weight
in diplomatic manoeuvres that Aus-
tralia is particularly inexperienced.
Marshall Saxe, the eighteenth-century
general, regarded it as a failure when
he actually had to fight a battle. This
seems a quaintly Ruritanian attitude
to most of us in the twentieth cen-
tury, who in the newsreel of our imag-
ination often see war in terms of
death or glory, blood and guts, all or
nothing romanticism. The rational
eighteenth-century mind saw it differ-
ently; it was the job of the diplomats
to achieve the aims of the State, and
war, if it came, was only a reflection
of their failure. To generals like Saxe,
success or failure in war was not meas-
ured in casualties mutually inflicted
or battles won, but in aims achieved.
If keeping an enemy out could be
achieved by manoeuvre alone, he did
it and kept his army intact. Where
battle was unavoidable, it was fought
with the minimum violence necessary
and at the enemy’s weakest point. You
don’t find Saxe among the great mili-
tary heroes like Napoleon and the
up - and -at - ’em generals of World
War I, for somehow in the West we
fell into the trap of measuring success
in war by the number of enemy killed.
Yet this really has nothing to do with
it.
If you think Marshall Saxe an amus-
ing exception to the rule, then there’s
an example closer to our own time. The
most significant war fought in the
twentieth century took place between
1948 and 1964. It began with the Ber-
lin Blockade and ended sometime after
the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from
Cuba. Not a shot was fired in Western
Europe, there were no battle honors
nor any medals, but it was war just
the same. Its leaders were men in dark
suits around conference tables or uni-
formed officers in underground com-
mand posts. Its aims were a trial of
strength, between the Soviet Bloc and
the West with Western Europe as its
prize. Its weapons were nuclear war-
heads, bombers, and toward the end
inter-continental missiles. Fleets
manoeuvred against each other in the
air and at sea but they mostly saw each
other as blips on a radar screen. Its out-


come was more important for the
world than either World War I or II
and yet there was no mass slaughter.
The only casualties were the ex-
tremists, who became un - persons on
one side and untouchables on the other.
The world is probably a better place
in that there was no decisive victory but
that it was, in the eighteenth-century
way, settled.
In considering Australian military
policy as not merely battles and bayonet
charges, but more often well-balanced
forces coupled with intelligent dip-
lomacy, in trying to raise discussion on
defence from the visceral to the cere-
bral level let us now consider the
present dispersal of our forces, and
then the position of each of the Ser-
vices.
If you take a map of South-East
Asia and put pins in wherever Aus-
tralian forces are located, you get an
immediate picture of the dispersed
and diffuse military commitment in
the area. We are spread from Übon
to Nui Dat, from Rabaul to Pucka-
punyal, from Terendak to Borneo.
For a nation of limited military
strength, we cover a lot of ground and
it is difficult to see how this ties in with
the key principle of war —concentration.
The answer is, of course, that it doesn’t,
that none of our forces are posted to
act in an independent role, they are
there as contributions to one more
treaty or agreement. The question we
should be asking ourselves is are
we getting the best return on our capi-
tal by this sort of dispersal? If we
consider that the main role of armed
forces is showing the flag to our allies
for future protection, then the present
agreement is reasonable, since we have
our flag flying in some far-flung out-
posts.
With the British on the point of pull-
ing out of Malaysia, however, it may be
that this dispersal is no longer practical.
It depends on what we think our
national aims are, of course, whether we
should concentrate all our resources
around Malaysia and the Pacific, or con-
tinue as we are. We are capable of
succeeding Britain in this part of the
world and there is a good case why we
should do so. There is a requirement for
a stabilising force in Malaysia and near
Singapore. Neither of these two nations
have reached the stage where they can
look after themselves. Both of them are,
in fact, looking forward to our assuming
more defence responsibility. This is one
area of Asia where Australians are wel-
come. We should take up this respon-
sibility with all the strength we can
muster, for this is one of the decisive
regions for Asia’s future. Both Malaysia
and Singapore are democratic and pros-
perous and have every chance of
developing into stable and just societies,
the very model which we should hold
up as an example to the rest of Asia, but
both of them could be destroyed by
external military adventurism, or from
within by internal subversion. Australia
must see that this never happens. It
should also be remembered that
although the counter-insurgency battle
was won in Malaysia, some 500 or
more Communist terrorists are still
holed up just over the border in Thai-
land as a potential menace in the future.
Strategically, this area is a land bridge
between the mainland and Indonesia. It
is of primary importance to Australia
that it remains in friendly hands. Should
the worst come to the worst and Thai-
land was the victim of overt aggression,
then a strategic reserve stationed in
Malaysia would be the swiftest way we
could fulfil our SEATO commitments.
On every count, our front door recom-
mends itself as the area for our maxi-
mum effort. There would be little dis-
agreement in any political quarter about
it. The only differences would be how.
By concentrating our military strength
around this area, we would in fact be
making a more valuable contribution
to the U.S. alliance than we are in
Vietnam. Two battalions are neither
here nor there against the total Ameri-
can commitment. But a strong, mobile
Australian force of all three Services in
Malaysia would be a different matter
entirely. It would be an aid to stability
in an area where U.S. forces are not
welcome . . . Even if preservation of
the American alliance is our overall
aim, it would be better served by our
deployment on our own front door.
Nature abhors a vacuum and the likeli-
hood of one in the North Indian Ocean
in the ’seventies is a distinct possibility.
Now let us consider each of the Ser-
vices in turn, in light of the kind of role
Australia might be expected to play.
There is always an equipment prob-
lem for small nations in their Air
Forces and Navies. The roles they have
to perform are often as diverse as those
of large powers, yet their budgets are
fractional. The RAAF has a require-
ment to achieve air superiority, there-
fore it needs a high-performance fighter
like the Mirage and all the expensive
black boxes that go with it. It also
needs attack aircraft if it’s going to
have teeth, ground - attack planes for
close Army support, and transport
aircraft, both strategic and tactical. It
gets a fraction of what it needs.
It has a good fighter in the Mirage,
but not enough ground-control radars.
It has no attack aircraft other than
the obsolete Canberra. Enough has
been written about the Fill already —■
but why we should have jumped from
the Canberra to this highly sophisti-
cated weapons system has never been
satisfactorily explained. The Fill is
designed to penetrate the electronic
defences of a first-class power, but there
don’t seem to be any first-class powers
in our immediate neighborhood un-
less the planners decided we might join
an international nuclear strike force. If
not, we have been saddled with an ex-
pensive complex aeroplane too sophisti-
cated for the sort of job we might do.
Why we didn’t buy the half as dear
supersonic Phantom, the fighter-
bomber workhorse in North Vietnam
operations, which comes in a number
of versions and is all the time being im-
proved, is hard to understand. We
could have bought twice as many for
the same money and had them in ser-
vice now.
To an Air Force which is struggling
to get a few warlike aeroplanes, trans-
port requirements take second place.
Yet we can overlook mobility only at
our peril. The prime requirements
for us in the future will be the ability
to move our limited forces for long-
distances quickly. In most operations of
war, a small force moved in quickly is
often worth four times the number
brought in later. Air mobility also
allows a small power to make more
effective use of limited strength. We
need the capacity to move a task
force at short notice. At present we
would be struggling to move a battalion.
The Navy, as at present constituted,
is largely a defensive force. Almost
all the ships in commission have an
anti-submarine role. Thanks to the
locally designed Ikara missile, the
ships fitted with it have sub-killing-
potential second to none. Like the Air
Force, however, the Navy has a multi-
tude of tasks with a third-rate budget.
In a world war, there would be obvi-
ously a threat to sea communications
from Russian submarines. But short
of World War 111 it’s hard to see
what other submarine threat there is
around the Pacific. A Navy has other
more important roles. It needs strike
capacity via aircraft-carriers and
therefore a deterrent ability. In an
area such as ours of long sea distances
and few developed airfields, an aircraft-
carrier is still the best way of getting
strike power to a trouble spot quickly.
And speedy reactions are what we
should be concentrating on.
Carriers take with them their own
ground - control, maintenance, and
supply system, facilities that take time
and money to build up in South-East
Asia. They come pretty expensive at
around S2OO million a unit. However,
we would not need the very latest •
just good, solid vessels, bought second-
hand. It is hard to see how we can have
an effective Navy without them.
The main brunt of the defence
expansion has fallen on the Army.
From a standing start of just over
three battalions, it had to form eight
and it had to do this while enlisting
and training National Servicemen.
The Regular Army, with its National
Service component, is now formed into
three task forces of two battalions each.
Of the remaining two battalions, one
is in Malaysia. The rest of the ARA
is absorbed by Army schools, workshops,
and headquarters. Two years ago, the
Army underwent a reorganisation
which superficially resembles the old
divisional structure of World War 11.
The big difference was that a division
became air-portable, a sound concept


for operations in our part of the world.
Every unit and its equipment was cap-
able of being lifted in an aeroplane no
heavier than the Hercules. At the
same time, the divisional air regiment
was started, to fly light fixed-wing
aircraft and light helicopters. After
a demarcation dispute, the RAAF
managed to retain control of anything
heavier.
In Vietnam, the utility helicopter
has become what the three-ton truck
was in World War 11, and in addition,
to combat-troop carrying and supply,
it can, when fitted with armament,
become a very effective and accurate
fire platform. It can save lives by
putting down fire yards in front of
the forward troops. But our Task Force
in Vietnam is supported by only nine
Australian utility helicopters. The
RAAF, preoccupied by fighters and
bombers, has neglected Army support.
This is not entirely the RAAF’s fault,
since limited budgets have not allowed
purchases in all fields of aviation.
On the other hand, the RAAF should
not be involved in Army tactical sup-
port at all; these aeroplanes should be
flown by the Army as they are in the
U.S. The Americans have gone even
further by forming air-mobile divisions
. . . self - flown combat formations
which can react three times as quickly
as ground-based units. One might also
ask why we buy VIP aircraft when
we’re short of tactical support aircraft
for use in combat now. For major
troop lifts and helicopter gun - ship
support, we are dependent on the U.S.
Army in Vietnam. Likewise the heavy
artillery which reaches out to protect
the far limits of the Task Force area
in Phoc Tuy province is also Ameri-
can. In two major areas of modern
warfare we are incapable of operating
without the help of our great and
powerful friend.
On paper, the CMF is organised on
the same lines as the Regular field
force. In fact, it has only a fraction of
the equipment or capability. The role
of the CMF is described as a back-up
force for the Regular Army in time of
limited war. If manpower require-
ment and reinforcement problems were
overcome, it would probably take be-
tween three to six months to field a
CMF unit. In an emergency, could
we wait that long for the other half
of our Army? One of the reasons they
were able to get away with such a
small defence budget during the Men-
zies era was that the Army, and the
CMF in particular, limped along on
World War II equipment. At long
last this is disappearing from the
shelves, but so far there has been only a
trickle of the new equipment reaching
the part-time Army. By juggling and
staggering the camps, most units can
get by for a fortnight per year. What
would happen if all the units were
called up at once?
If Australia is serious about the CMF,
then it should be properly equipped. If,
on the other hand, the citizen army has
outlived its usefulness, then it should be
scrapped. Defence decisions based on
sentiment or politics lead to situations
like Dunkirk or Singapore. In any case,
one would have thought we had learnt
our lesson in two world wars about
raising forces which were improperly
equipped. It seems strange that in 1967
one should have to argue at all on these
lines. There is no middle road with
defence forces. If you raise them, you
equip them so that they may be used.
If not, you scrap them and save your
money. A halfway house is an invitation
to disaster.
The CMF is the last repository of
the voluntary system in the Services, the
last place where a citizen can make a
part-time contribution to national de-
fence. This is more important than mere
numbers. There has been a strong tradi-
tion in Australian history for the volun-
tary principle in defence. Part of the
national myth is based on it. Though
our pacifist friends abhor it, Australia
is best known overseas by the reputation
of her citizen soldiers who volunteered
in two wars. Although the CMF has
suffered by being at the end of the line
in an era of low priorities, its strength
has been growing since the advent of
National Service. In the future, it can
either continue to languish as a token
force, or be called on to take a more
active part in defence. As we inevitably
take on new commitments when the
British withdraw, our manpower prob-
lems will become acute; there is no
reason why battalions, or even Task
Forces, of the CMF should not be called
up for limited periods to share some
of the load. This would have the addi-
tional advantage of giving experience
to the post-war generation, who are now
in the majority. The recent example of
Israel proved that a citizen army, prop-
erly led, is still a force to be reckoned
with.
It seems to be a fact of life that
young Australians won’t join the Regu-
lar Army in sufficient numbers to main-
tain any reasonably sized field force.
Therefore it follows that National Ser-
vice is here to stay. It would be in-
teresting to see the results of a survey of
why so few young men are attracted
to a career in the Armed Forces. Argu-
ments about a softer generation and too
much prosperity can be instantly dis-
carded, but one wonders how much
Government lack of interest in defence
over the past two decades has rubbed
off on the younger generation. The
three Services are concerned about a
parallel problem, the re-engagement
rate. Experienced personnel are leaving
the Services at the end of their first en-
gagement. High wages and full employ-
ment are probably the major reason,
particularly among technical people,
but they are by no means the only
reasons. Shortages of equipment and
the sense of low priority inevitably
affect morale. The Treasury influence
is all-pervading and the Services are'
run on strict sets of financial regula-
tions. This is as it should be, but the
Public Service atmosphere is not always
appropriate in an Armed Service.
The Defence Retirements Benefit
Fund, for example, has become a focus
of discontent. This scheme requires
quite heavy contributions for mem-
bers in order to ensure a reasonable
pension on retirement. Gone are the
days when the old soldier went on to
half pay on retirement. Now he’s got
to start thinking about paying for his
pension from enlistment. Officers claim
that the fund is actually less generous
than the public servants’ own super-
annuation, and they point out that there
is more to running a Service than sets
of regulations and laborious accounting
procedures, that the member of an
Armed Service differs from the public
servant in one striking way he may
be called upon as part of his normal
duties to lay down his life. He has an
unlimited liability clause in his con-
tract. Since we require him to do this,
we should at least see that he is not
unnecessarily penalised in other ways.
Despite the general feeling that they
run a bad second in status to public
servants, the officers in the Australian
Armed Services give the taxpayer good
value for his money. The great
majority of them are skilful and effici-
ent by world standard. It’s remarkable
what a high calibre we do manage to
attract, even with the disadvantages.
They have to attain standards which are
far more rigorous than anything to be
found outside. Promotion examinations
are difficult. Officers are reported on
annually from the beginning of their
service; these reports follow them
through their careers. And one black
mark can be disastrous. This tends to
put a premium on “safe” organisation
men rather than imaginative activists,
but even these have been known to
overcome the hazards of rule regula-
tion to emerge at the top.
The shape of our Armed Forces can
only be determined when our national
aims are clarified. Of course as a last
resort we can always retire into
“Fortress Australia” and shrug off all
entanglements. No reason at all, if we
are content to sit in our little enclave
of prosperity being spectators and not
participants in the history of our
region. But if we have something to
offer in terms of co-operation and
security to our friends in the area, then
we should go all out and offer it. The
myths we have built up around the
Australian characters are not reflected
in our foreign policies. One looks in
vain for anything which is adventur-
ous or even independent. A younger
generation of Australians needs some-
thing to be proud of.
Fostering the American Alliance
makes good pragmatic sense, but it is
not an act which necessarily makes us
hold our heads up any higher as an
independent nation. While we have it
now, we should remember that the
Americans don’t live here. They may
pull out in the decades ahead. The
pitfall of alliances with a strong pro-
tector is that the weaker partner tends
to complacency. “What’s the use,
we’ll never be strong enough to look

after ourselves” is a not infrequent
comment in this country. Fortun-
ately for them, the Israelis, outnum-
bered 10 to 1, never subscribed to this
argument. The other effect is more
subtle and diffuse. National character,
sense of purpose, qualities which dis-
tinguish a nation from a colonial settle-
ment, tend to wilt under protective
umbrellas. The young Australian is
some of the best raw material in the
world. It is a pity that we only seem
to develop leaders in a crisis.
Defence and Party politics are not
always a sound mixture. Using defence
as a vote-getting issue, turning on
crises at election times and scoring
parliamentary points on superficial
issues, are vices on both sides of the
fence. The Holt Government has had
the thankless and expensive task of
refurbishing our Armed Services after
nearly 20 lean years. They have begun
to achieve results, but it seems in the
latest Budget that what were matters of
urgency last year can be played down
this year. Refitting the Daring-class
destroyers is to be shelved and the
Army will not get its Sheridan tanks.
One can hope that the Government
will be closely questioned on the lat-
ter, since there is an immediate need
for amphibious close-support vehicles
in the Task Force in Vietnam. Defence
equipment must be seen in terms of
lives as well as money. In our short
history, we have always tended to under-
equip our Forces.
Defence is expensive, particularly if
you buy equipment from foreign sup-
pliers. Nations like Sweden have
lessened the cost by manufacturing all
their armaments. This in turn creates
employment and increases industrial
capacity. If we can make Mirages, why
can’t we also be making helicopters,
light aircraft, and transport planes?
We have one of the fastest growing
civilian markets in the world for these
aircraft. Our big automotive capacity
is hardly touched by defence.
As we approach the uncertain
’seventies we find we have an Air
Force which is capable of fighting an
air-superiority battle against first-class
aircraft and eventually (when we get
the Fill) able to hit targets half a
globe away, but which is not equipped
to support a counter-insurgency opera-
tion like the one we are engaged in
now. Our Navy is equipped to run an
anti-submarine battle in a global war,
but has little or no strike capacity to
fight either a limited war or support
a Vietnam-type situation. The Army,
on the other hand, is well trained for
the type of war it’s involved in, but
lacks some supporting weapons and
air-mobility which would make a truly
independent force.
Whether we can get away with this
patchwork planning in the future will
depend on events in our near north.


FORUM
Australian Poetry—nobody's
rocking the boat
By ALEXANDER CRAIG
IT OUGHT TO BE possible to write
straightforwardly about the present
state of Australian poetry without fear
or favor. It isn’t, however. The position,
in one way, is a bit like inquiring at
a hospital about the health of certain
patients and receiving an equivocal
reply: in this instance, you’re more
likely to receive a misleading answer,
because the patients, are also doctors
with a particular professional pride in
their skill, though very few of them
could really be called professionals. In
a different way, you also find that much
writing on Australian poetry is con-
cerned with personalities. The “literary
gang warfare” of a few years back,
when, for example, “Australian Letters”
attacked A. D. Hope in schoolboy satire
and, with notable lack of taste, lam-
pooned the person of James McAuley,
appears to have mostly subsided: there
doesn’t seem, to be quite the amount of
crossfire and sniping at one another
from the poets of Adelaide, Melbourne,
and Sydney.
The English critic A. Alvarez has
said (and Walter Allen wrote at length
on the same theme): “The first fact
that has always faced the American
writer is precisely, I think, the blank-
ness and indifference of his audience
... It is this assumption of a funda-
mental isolation that makes for the
peculiar strength of the American
artist.” That first sentence is equally
true of the Australian writer of poetry,
but Australian poets at various times
have tended to form a kind of club for
mutual comfort and protection: they
gain a collective strength which, un-
fortunately, is not artistic. R. A. Simp-
son wrote a satirical poem not long
back called “All Friends Together,”
subtitled “A Survey of Present-day
Australian Poetry,” in which “Geoff
and John and Nancy . . . Tom and
Les, Robert, Nan . . . Rod and some-
one else” chummily review one
another’s books. This certainly shows
an important aspect of the situation in
1967. We’re all sailing along calmly.
And no one’s going to bloody well
rock the boat!
It needs to be said that this kind of
sailing resembles the progress of a heavy
ferry in some bay or backwater
sluggish and downright boring. It needs
to be said that the five or six good poets
writing now are arrant individualists
with no attachment to a coterie. Among
these poets are Gwen Harwood, Ran-
dolf Stow, William Hart-Smith, Evan
Jones. Their work, thought frequently
exciting, is just as frequently ignored.
A more famous poet, A. D. Hope, could
be added to the list. The Poetic Estab-
lishment’s Younger Set soon becomes
just as reactionary as the parent group,
just as hostile to valid or successful
poetic experiment (it’s not hostile to
gimmickry and superficial novelty): the
conservative Establishment controls
most of the avenues of reviewing that
have long substituted for any body or
canons of literary criticism in our coun-
try. It knew how to deal with an extre-
mist like Bertram Higgins of the short-
lived magazine “Stream” in 1931 and,
when new poems of his appeared from
1945 to 1947, sending him from the
1950 s onward into a career of editing
school anthologies, hiding under two
initials; it turned Max Harris into the
public personality we all know, writing
his sensitive and powerful poems still,
apparently, but in secret.
William Hart-Smith, one of the five
or six good poets whom I’ve mentioned,
disappoints me from time to time by
being a bit too loose —in that he tends to
fall into the characteristic Australian
vice of restatement or even repetition.
Good poetry, for me, now, is extremely
concentrated and concise in all its parts,
doesn’t waste a single word, and has a
clarity of sensory content and movement
and at least one immediately accessible
layer of meaning (if this seems to imply
that it has other layers, that’s right).
'Hart-Smith gets this sometimes, many
present-day Australian poets never. It’s
not necessarily connected with innovat-
ing techniques: Kenneth Slessor’s
“South Country,” very “traditional” in
stanzaic and metrical form, frequently
seems to me now perhaps the best single
poem ever written by an Australian. It’s
deeply personal; it has what a friend of
mine (in an entirely different connec-
tion) called “a fine, hard-edge quality”
in the right places: it avoids any element
of the currently fashionable “auto-
biography,” that chatty stuff (often in-
volving somebody’s “aunt” or such)
that dominates the work of even some
of the better poets today. Slessor’s final
image is one of tremendous emotional
force. I offer the poem as a corrective
to a lot of things happening now.
There’s no sense in innovation for
its own sake as a young man who wrote
to The Bulletin a year or so ago seemed
to think, the poor bloke who asked:
“What hope have we in Australia of
developing poetry along the ‘modernist’
lines of the 19605; e.g., the serialist
poetry . . . the concrete poetry . . . and
the kinetic poetry . . ?” Innovation’s
justified only if it’s functional: it must
meet an immediate, individual, poetic
need; and referring to one technique
(no longer at all new) wise old Eliot
once remarked: “No vers is libre for
the man who wants to do a good job.”
I found it hard to justify the stub-
born conservatism of Australian verse
to any American friends. What the
heroic couplet was to the first half of
the English 18th century the quatrain
has been, is now, and (it seems) ever
shall be to Australian poetry. It dom-
inates even more than do those padded
or leaden pentameters that plod relent-
lessly across many pages of the annual
“Australian Poetry” anthologies more
than the stock adjectives, the unfunc-
tional or merely pretty epithets, the
stale neo-Georgian diction in many of
the poems. This isn’t necessarily the
editors’ fault: they have to harvest the
best of the yearly crop. John Thompson
had a particularly bad year in 1965;
my hopes rose for Max Harris’ forth-
coming selection, until he complained
recently in “The Australian” of the dull-
ness of current Australian poetry.
Charles Higham at first wanted to blame
A. D. Hope for the dominance of
quatrains though, like me, he very
much admires Hope’s finest work
but you can find enough in early R. D.
Fitzgerald during the late 1920 s and,
before him, in Brennan. There are
plenty of quatrains from him back to
Harpur. However, it’s a pity to find a
poet of such lyric sensitivity as Vivian
Smith apparently condemning himself
to a ceaseless round of alternately
rhymed, elegiac, four-line stanzas. Geof-
frey Dutton, whom I think of as the
worst famous poet in Australia, usually
sprawls in long verse-paragraphs, but

he has at times adapted his repetitiously
discursive meanderings to the quatrain.
Despite the modernism of his texture,
Francis Webb is conservative in his
choice of stanza patterns and also in
the line-lengths he plays his variations
on: so until recently was Evan Jones —
the most underrated poet in Australia,
to my mind. Chris Wallace-Crabbe
seems to be moving toward a fresh
conception of poetry. Wallace-Crabbe,
of course, has just lived for a year and
a half in the U.S.A., so the goodness
of his new poems is quite likely to be
measured by the intensity of the poet-
tasters’ cries of “Go home, Yank!”
America can give an Australian poet
perspective and distance: it needn’t give
him influences.
Vincent Buckley’s example demon-
strates that one way of discounting a
poet of increasing stature is simply
to tie a label on him. J. R. Rowland
should perhaps be placed among the
best poets, but such poems as his
recently anthologised “Canberra in
April” piece show him apparently
being corrupted by Hope’s “discursive
mode.” There was never any need
for Hope to recommend this to Aus-
tralian poets: its has been practised
since verse was first written in English
on this continent. Dutton has merely
brought it to its present high pitch of
imperfection. I know that Dutton’s a
nice bloke and all that. But this has
nothing to do with the fact that he’s
a pretty bad poet —except perhaps for
two very early short poems about
flying. The shallow, selfconscious,
stilted, reactionary metrics of the very
recent James McAuley are at the
opposite extreme from the declamatory
slackness of a Dutton and are a great
disappointment to those who remember
the rhythmic energy and the imagina-
tive sweep of his first book of verse,
“Under Aldebaran,” and parts of his
second, “A Vision of Ceremony.” It’s
possible to have a great admiration for
Professor McAuley personally and yet
to see that, as a poet, he no longer
has any hold on the 20th century.
In Judith Wright’s “Preoccupations
in Australian Poetry,” Webb shares
much of the last chapter with John
Blight. Having recently seen some
newly published poems by Blight, I’m
reminded of her book, and it’s difficult
to see how anybody, let alone a poet
of Judith Wright’s technical skill, could
give any prominence to him. It’s not
so much that he’s “unfashionable” (as
she puts it), though he’s certainly old-
fashioned—a sort of clumsy oceanic
equivalent of “a poor man’s Robert
Frost”—but it’s simply that Blight is
awkward, graceless, and limited not
only technically. I suspect that what
we have in “Preoccupations” is the
partiality of friendship.
Judith Wright earlier in her career
wrote some of the finest poems we have
in this country, particularly in the first
part of “Woman to Man.” There’s no
taking away from that achievement.
But in 1967 and for a few years previ-
ously, Gwen Harwood has been
immensely her superior: in some ways,
Gwen Harwood is the best Australian
poet writing today. She hasn’t been
responsible for much technical innova-
tion yet, but it’s worthy of note that,
in personal letters, she has long ex-
pressed considerable dissatisfaction with
“skunky pentameters.” She appears
to be nearing the height of her powers
as an incisive, original, deeply human
poet: she possesses vigor, music, and
variety: she even has a sense of humor,
and there’s not much of that in Aus-
tralian poetry these days! With the
urban poem “Typists in the Phoenix
Building,” Judith Wright seemed
briefly to be on the verge of a really
new development, but that was a few
years ago, and soon we were intro-
duced to the now-famous aviary with
its mostly moulting feathers.
I sometimes think it’s a pity that
we’ve never had a William Carlos
Williams in Australia, to exemplify a
really contemporary, colloquial, ele-
vated, indigenous language, one sensi-
tively and imaginatively employing
idiom and, at the same time, showing
toughness and adaptability to our con-
temporary and largely urban society.
Such a poet doesn’t consciously set out
to create a particular local tone and
rhythm, and this should grow up natur-
ally in a poetry, certainly. Such a
language isn’t the “Ben Bowyang,”
“Weird Mob” diction of, say, an lan
Mudie, who also goes beyond free
verse into free prose. There’s a favorite
quotation of mine from Allen Tate,
that “the arts everywhere spring from
a mysterious union of indigenous mater-
ials and foreign influences: there is no
great art of literature that does not
bear the marks of this fusion . .
Williams also bears these marks, and
his best poems have a sort of in-
evitability of shape and a rightness of
their own, the kind of rich economy,
that we require of poetry. A poet like
this could possibly have helped to
rescue our verse from its conservatism
of metrics and its heavy rhythms, point-
ing toward a functional, experimental
technique based on a living speech.
The forceful development of the con-
crete image, the writing without meta-
phor even in the most intensely evoc-
ative poems, the polyglot heritage, are
other things that younger men and
contemporaries might have been able
to draw on or differ from. Such a
poet would at least have forced them
to clarify, define, and justify their
individual directions.
In mid-1967, I don’t find many Aus-
tralian poets infusing life into tbe old
forms. Our “Beat” poets are copies of
copies (without a tenth of the talent
of an Allen Ginsberg): their American
models go back to Whitman for rhythms
and aren’t very interesting technically
(even Ginsberg’s successful poems be-
ing mainly triumphs of imagery, tone,
and diction). The “new” forms and
the anti-forms are largely fake or
spurious and don’t amount to anything.
A good Australian poet in 1967 must
find subjective devices which are his
alone and, possibly, of use only to him-
self.


SYDNEY’S HAPPY
HIPPIES
By MARGERY DAVIS
AT A MEETING last week to launch
Sydney’s second hippie newspaper,
which should be a pretty glossy pro-
fessional affair, some of the hippie in-
telligentsia took some time out to take
stock.
The talk was in general terms. Do
Australian hippies really know the
meaning of love? Is their committal
absolute? Will there ever be a hippie
district in Sydney resembling the
Haight-Ashbury district in San Fran-
cisco? It emerged that someone was
trying to arouse interest in communal
farming, which would be a start, but
he didn’t have much money.
One of the group was preoccupied
with a project called Kiva, which, he
said, was an American Indian word
meaning a tribal gathering. With the
help of subscribers he wanted to buy a
house in the inner city area for people
who had nowhere to sleep. This later
would extend into a library and arts
workshop. But his problem was also
money.
We brought up Indian mysticism and
the adoption of Red Indian dress. The
intelligentsia sighed into its coffee.
If Senta Taft and the Native Art Shop
at the Cross expect to do well out of
these developments they will be dis-
appointed. There is no attempt to trans-
late them into local idiom. Only those
who had been on the scene in Frisco
and had returned to Sydney seemed
aware of these new blossomings of the
flower children.
One of the group had lived in
Frisco and had been turning on with
“acid” as long ago as ’6O.
Man, said the group, to think we
knew nothing about it then.
That’s right, said the traveller. Don’t
expect it all to drop into place all
at once. Just let it happen, man. Seven
years it took over there; that’s a long
time to get a scene off the ground.
I brought up the Arts and there was
talk of a new era.
In painting, Gordon Mutch seemed
to be out on his own. His scratch-back-
rub-carbon techniques coupled with his
blow-ups and intricate penwork had
suggested hallucinogenic extensions of
the mind and out-of-this world phan-
tasies for a long time.
Before psychedelia was heard of, I
can remember Mutch pulling sheets of
carefully protected dusted carbons out
of his inevitable briefcase and bidding
the gathering to find the figures, or
the Mutches, or the Martians, or the
devils in his current masterpieces which
he would rotate slowly, shaking his
head in wonder. lam eternally grate-
ful that I once appeared on the shoul-
der of a cowboy in a letraset collage.
But in those days Mutch’s entreaties
were regarded as part of a parlor game.
Now his work is not only “in” but
in demand. At a psychedelic jazz con-
cert he helped promote recently he
sold hundreds of his posters at 30c each
and a Melbourne fashion company is
anxious to pay a lot to hire one of his
psychedelic films for a promotion of a
new dress material.
The Wayside Chapel, Kings Cross,
so far has produced two psychedelic
bands. The Wright group emerged first,
bombarding its audience with powerful
sound, partly rock. They played three
nights of the week until they dropped,
except for the guitarists, who kept going
only until he had broken every string.
More recently John Terry, who studied
music for seven years at the Sydney
Conservatorium, has achieved a fol-
lowing and a good Press for his more
controlled sound.
As far as writing goes, the only
examples so far to be seen are in poetry.
There cannot be much around because
Sydney’s first hippie newspaper, the
“Psychedelic Stir,” a roneoed militant,
went to the trouble to obtain rights to
publish the works of American hippie
poets Walt Whitman and Allen
Ginsberg.
The night of the Purple Mystic Art
Factory was a distinct disappointment
to both police and the Press. Despite
their regalia, all the hippies actually
DID was walk around with flowers in
their hair. The talk was soft, but
hardly abstract. Many wore “insane
gear,” but police conceded there was
not much of that other “gear” around.
For these very reasons, the hippies pro-
claimed their first happening a suc-
cess, an example of the spoof-on-society
tactics of the U.S. hippies.
To illustrate his point, one organiser,
moustached David Graves, who wore
white and purple, told the story of a
Los Angeles hippie who was ecstatic
at having rallied 30,000 hippies in an
anti-Vietnam march. But his hipper
friend had replied: “Man, when we get
30,000 people marching for no reason
at all, then that will be something.”
When last heard of the Purple Mystic
Art Factory was mulling over the idea
of holding a happening on the site of
the Sydney Opera House.
Then one drizzly Saturday morning
in Wynyard Park we went to Sydney’s
first hippie wedding. Grateful at hav-
ing been filled in, we arrived ready
to join other Pressmen and the police,
but there were no police and no other
Press representatives.
A self-appointed celebrant, Moham-
med Sharaf-El-Din, joined the happy
couple beside a Be Tidy bin under a
tree which was the “largest phallic
symbol” they could find. The bride
kissed all the females present, and the
groom, barefooted and dressed in a
Union Jack, kissed all the males. They
are married, according to Mohammed
Sharaf-El-Din, until they decide to go
their separate ways.
He has meanwhile formed Australia’s
first Hippie Marriage and Divorce
Bureau at his headquarters in Forbes
St., Kings Cross. He is now open for
business, with a mail box at the G.P.O.
and a soap-box in the Domain.
Recently, within 10 days, three pub-
lic happenings took place.
The most professional of these took
place on a Sunday night at the Cell
Block Theatre, where promoters, well-
known jazzmen, and Mutch’s posters
attracted 800; 200 had to be turned
away. One of the promoters was Don
Westlake, a member of the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, who had pro-
moted four classical concerts. A serious,
sound, unlikely sort of man to invade
psychedelia, he is overjoyed that a
rabbi, several over-sixties, and many
serious music lovers had obviously
enjoyed his psychedelic jazz happening.
Westlake does not take LSD, but he
told the musicians to simulate a “trip.”
The climax came in the second half
when the musicians blew wild sounds
and wailed against flashing lights,
revolving prisms, and Mutch’s psyche-
delic films.
Mutch and Westlake will take their
concert to Canberra to play at the
Canberra Theatre on Saturday, Sep-
tember 16.
Two nights later there was a charity
happening at Darlinghurst with music
and Albie Thoms’ ÜBU films. Two
dollars a head to cover the hall and
to raise money for legal defence for
three musicians from the Id group
who are on bail for a marihuana
charge. At least one of the Id plans
to plead guilty in a first step to obtain
a test case for the legalisation of mari-
huana.
Finally, a few nights ago, there was
Clem O’Connell’s Explosion Happen-
ing at the Cell Block Theatre. This
proved to be a switched-on but casual
affair, with Mutch and ÜBU films once
more in attendance. Music was pro-
vided by fluorescent-paint-daubed
Black Allan and Just Human, and the
Big Apple Union. Wearing resplendent
white robes and sunglasses was Abdul
Kashmir Carpet IV, a new arrival
from the London scene.
The psychedelic groups, we were told,
were now beginning to get regular book-
ings around Sydney, even at the clubs,
which seems just one more example of
the institutionalisation of the avant
garde.


FAIR-DINKUM CHINATOWN
By SANDRA JOBSON
PILES OF ROTTING cabbages litter
the streets around Sydney Municipal
Markets like a never-ending salad, and
Chinese jokes: “Bananas Always on
Hand” adorn the warehouse entrances
of Hie Lee and Co, You see “D. G.
Liu and H. J. Wah trading as John
Orr, also as Sydney Banana Co.” And
on a high shelf inside the darkened
warehouse of Yep Lum and Co. rests
a daffodil in a cup.
This is where Sydney’s Chinatown
began. The Chinese came to Australia
with the goldrushes of the mid-19th
century and stayed on to grow vege-
tables and dutifully prepare Chinese
meals. In the old days, “Chinese” and
“market gardener” were practically
synonymous, but opposition from post-
war immigration from Southern Europe
(and from Australians) has entered
their market garden of Eden, and now
less than half of the warehouses and
wholesale concerns are owned by
Chinese.
A fifth column of Italian restaurants,
too, is infiltrating this traditional bas-
tion of Chinese custom. An Italian
restaurant advertises boldly that Luigi
Is Here, but Luigi is in a back alley.
And sitting right on the sunniest corner
of Dixon Street itself is a somnolent
cafe named Gi Gi, in which doze a
tortoiseshell cat and an aged alsatian,
and Chinese men sit sipping Coca-Cola
after a hard morning’s work at the
Markets.
The restaurants and cafes in Dixon
Street started out as cafes for the
Market workers, and even today they
are open very early in the morning for
customers from the Markets.
Each of these neighboring streets
has been regarded as the centre of
Chinatown at one time or another.
Before 1942 and the American Forces’
“invasion,” when eating Chinese food
became immensely popular, it used to
be along Campbell St., toward the
Tivoli Theatre, part of rundowntown
Sydney. Since the war everything has
gradually moved again, back toward
Dixon Street.
In this short, narrow street, squeezed
between a rococo Trades Hall and the
drab Markets building, spruce red and
black posters advertised a recent per-
formance of traditional Chinese Opera;
here you see torn announcements of
“Vietnam Bombing Protest at Ameri-
can Embassy,” peppered over with ads
for a Chinese film with English sub-
titles, “The Imperial Lady.” Chinese
tennis and social clubs, church groups,
and business committees announce their
coming events on notices pasted on
windows of cafes such as Yip’s Inn.
On the walls near the Paper Slitting
Company, Godfrey’s Boring Company,
and Taylor’s Gun Repairs you see the
sign of the Australian Colour Council,
and through an empty beer bottle
standing on a faded green window ledge
you can make out an ad for Camel
cigarettes, in Chinese.
On this side of the street is a spank-
ing new Chinese dry cleaners, one-day
service, waiting for the patronage of
Sydney’s Chinese population of about
8000 (no one knows the exact figure).
No longer the traditional steam laundry,
this establishment nevertheless savors
of “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” with a
notice on a door leading to the back
region: Chinese Club Members Only.
Back up the street, businesses thriv-
ing. With no regard for politics, the
general stores are selling Chinese deli-
cacies from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and
even the Northern mainland. Here,
traditional Chinese housewives in black
dresses and tight pigtails skewered with
tortoiseshell combs potter about among
the sacks of rice and bean shoots.
All day the customers come, Greeks,
Italians, Lebanese, and more and more
Australians, and each year the variety
of tinned goods and other wares
increases. One Dixon Street shop has
had to expand into another department
to cope with its growing stocks of
Hong Kong toys and jewellery and
china (good quality stuff, mind you).
Mr. King Fong, who inherited his
store from his father, along with six
other buildings in Dixon Street, tells
us that his father came from Fiji in
1946 and established his store in Dixon
Street. His children and their children
have lived all their lives in Aus-
tralia and, like most second- and
third-generation Australian Chinese,
they have been to school, matriculated,
and many of them attended university.
“The younger generation is impos-
sible,” said one Chinese businessman.
“All they want is to be Australian.”
But he brightened as he dwelt upon
their academic progress. One son is a
doctor, another a dentist. Nephews are
accountants, architects. They are doing
well. The Chinese in Sydney are fan-
atical about learning, and a university
education means status for them.
Despite their parents’ worries, the
young, swingingly clad Chinese still
show a healthy interest in the two-day-
old Hong Kong newspapers which are
flown four times a week to Sydney,
and they seem to enjoy the Hong Kong
movie magazines which tell of the
sagas of top stars like Ivy Ling 80,
Li Ching, and the tragically Monroe-
like Lin Dai, who suicided last year
despite adulation and riches.
Chinese cover girls are mostly fully-
clad and always grace the back covers
of the magazines, which start from the
back and work forwards. On the wire
rotating book stands are stacks of
Chinese paperback-to-fronts with lurid
jacket designs of helpless females hand-
cuffed or attacked by tigers.
In these general stores you can buy
books about watercolor painting, giving
scientific instructions and explanations
for traditional delicate landscapes. One
book tells you what shade of cobalt-
blue you will need to create “The Dairy
Farm in Pokfulam,” Lesson 20; “A
Bright Day in Fanling,” Lesson 13; or
“The Rock,” Lesson 16.
Plastic back-scratchers huddle against
tiers of sequined slippers in the stores,
and Chinese pandas gambol on the
painted sides of chamber pots. The
shops stock hand-painted bowls and
plates and ginger jars, and the tradi-
tional joss sticks and incense are attract-
ing flower-clad hippies to the scene like
moths to a candle.
There are but two joss (“sacred”)
houses left in Sydney, one at Ultimo,
the other at Waterloo. They are pat-
ronised only on festival occasions such
as the Chinese New Year, and their
restrained atmosphere is far away from
the crepe-paper dragons on sale for
“10th of the 10th” celebrations.
Nowadays many Chinese in Aus-
tralia have been converted to Chris-
tianity, some by the evangelical groups
who campaign for Christ with Chinese
placards and sermons on Sunday even-
ings round Dixon, Campbell, and
George Streets.
“But most Chinese have only one
religion dollars and cents,” said a
smiling merchant at the door of his
warehouse in the market area.
Apart from trade, Sydney’s Chinese
business community has two other
important matters in its mind—a plan
to rebuild Dixon Street into a true
Chinatown and the state of a Chinese
cemetery a few miles west at Rook-
wood.
“Our cemetery is in the doldrums
at present and we are planning a new
image for it,” Mr. King Fong said at
his Say Tin Fong general store in Dixon
Street.
Over a pot of rose tea at the Green
Jade cafe, Mr. Alan Lai Hung, chief
chairman of the Cemetery committee,
outlined their plans.
“The cemetery is only the begin-
ning, we hope. We want to build a fair-
dinkum Chinatown here in Dixon
Street, with shop awnings like in
Hong Kong. Perhaps we will have a
Chinese library, too. But we must not
rush too fast. First we must build our
summerhouse at the cemetery.”
If you see a Chinese man walking
down Dixon Street clasping a little
book to his breast you can be certain
it’s not the Thoughts of Chairman Mao
it is his bank book. And you can be
sure that nothing in that is red.


OVERSEAS
South Vietnam’s elections: the
best-known team won
from PETER SAMUEL in Saigon
“Y’KNOW I WORKED for that great
newsman Hearst, an’ I remember once
when he ran for office, for mayor, or
was it gov’nor? Don’t matter which.
Anyway the night the result was to
come out was unusual, busy. Two
separate editions of the papor was all
set up. One for if Hearst won. Its
headline said: HEARST SWEEPS
IN. The sub-head was New Era
Dawns or some such corn. The other
edition, for if he lost, was quite simple.
It was headed in massive black type:
FRAUD.”
Another American observer, a
southerner, told a story about “Big
Bill Thompson”, famous for quick
switches of ballot boxes in Chicago.
And not to be outdone, I retailed the
practice of graveyard-canvassing which
is so often a productive way of gather-
ing the extra few hundred “pensioner”
votes in the inner suburbs of Mel-
bourne. And one or two of the stories
of Australian trade-union elections be-
fore the days of court-controlled
ballots. And a Labor fixer’s advice to
his followers: “Vote early and vote
often.”
With this sort of banter common
currency among the several hundred
odd foreign journalists and observers at
the South Vietnam elections, there was
a good deal of competition to unearth
fiddling and fixing.
Opposition candidates made it one
of their main themes. The leading
civilian candidate, stumpy bent little
old schoolteacher Tran Van Huong,
early on alleged some of his campaign
organisers in the delta were being
intimidated. Journalists who hared out
there found they were wasting their
time when Huong’s leading organiser
in the area knew nothing of his
leader’s allegations. Huong then
claimed that the military would be
able to vote twice since they were
being issued with voter cards both at
home and at their barracks. Yes, there
was evidence, but it couldn’t be pro-
duced because it would incriminate the
soldiers involved, who would suffer per-
secution. But why not to the Aus-
tralian observers, someone asked at a
Press conference? They would surely
treat the material confidentially.
“Ah, but it is a great humiliation,”
Huong said, “for Vietnam that foreign
observers have to be called in to verify
our elections. I will present the evid-
ence to a proper investigating com-
mission of the Vietnamese National
Assembly.” At later meetings he down-
played his accusations further.
Others, however, took up the theme.
The prestigious Suu-Dan ticket actu-
ally finished their campaign with a
detailed explanation of ten different
forms of “Election Irregularity” and
the report of this filled four columns
in the broadsheet “Saigon Post” the
morning before the election. It did not
allege that a single one of these had
in fact occurred, but warned voters
and observers to “beware.”
At a meeting at Hue the first speaker
spent half his 15 minutes abusing
Nguyen Cao Ky for using Government
planes and helicopters as transport.
Almost providentially, as he was get-
ting up oratorial steam, helicopters—
most of which had brought us journa-
lists along half an hour before—roared
overhead on their way back to the air-
port, deafening out the public address
system, for 40 or 50 seconds.
That, he declared, was evidence that
the Government was trying to sabotage
his speech.
Election day went much as expected.
The three-quarters of the population
which lives in areas of reasonable
security and Government control,
turned out a high vote over 80 per-
cent.
There were incidents at only about
two dozen of the nation’s 8820 polling
places. Even so, about twenty people
died and a hundred were injured on
election day. And the sight of just one
polling place, a schoolroom in Cholon
into which a hand-grenade had been
tossed, its ballot box splintered, chairs
and tables smashed, and its walls and
floor splattered with blood, was enough
to make a point.
The Government’s police and soldiery
were out in great strength that day to
protect the voting booths, and it was
this, maybe, which caused the Com-
munists to resort mainly to indirect
attacks with mortars and rockets.
General terrorism was four times the
normal rate of 60 civilians killed and
120 wounded in the last week of the
election campaign. Election day saw
the Communists indulge in one parti-
cularly grotesque operation; near
Danang a squad of the Liberation Army
burst into a hospital and machine-
gunned patients in their beds. The vic-
tims included children and several Viet
Cong prisoners being treated for
injuries.
Otherwise the voting day was un-
eventful. Occasionally queues banked
up as people waited to get their ballot
papers. The entry of eleven teams for
the Presidential contest and 48 lists for
the Senate made the balloting very
cumbersome. Each entry was repre-
sented by a ballot paper with the
names, photographs, and symbol of the
team, and the floors of the booths soon
became littered with discarded paper.
But at the time of writing there have
been no reports of irregularities. The
election system, devised by the con-
stituent assembly, is a. complex of
checks and balances, which makes rig-
ging extraordinarily difficult. The com-
plete absence of censorship of the local
Press, the presence of 500 foreign
journalists and 100 observers, plus
Part of the electioneering scene —young campaign workers carry posters on their biker

AUSTRALIA’S ™ ™BTuLmNGSOCIEn
innumerable candidates and their repre-
sentatives with axes to grind ensured
that infractions would get reported.
There is little doubt that some pres-
sures were applied by the Government.
Some soldiers said they had been told
to vote Thieu-Ky by their officers. A
number of province chiefs and Govern-
ment officials probably worked to
“deliver” votes to the Government. But
what happened in the secrecy of the
voting booth is anybody’s guess.
Thieu and Ky, as men in power are
apt to do, made full use of their accu-
mulated prestige and of the Govern-
ment facilities at their disposal. Fami-
liar Australian debates about the use
of VIP planes were reproduced in full
in the villages and towns of South
Vietnam.
Against that must be put the fact
that the Government agreed to do a
great deal for the opposition candi-
dates: it printed at its own cost tens of
millions of pamphlets and five million
posters, gave candidates equal free time
on the radio, organised joint meetings,
provided transport, and gave each tic-
ket $30,000 for other campaign ex-
penses.
In a country without developed
political parties, with a covert style of
politics and no public-opinion, predic-
tions of the result were bound to be
mere hunches. Thieu and Ky probably
won because they are best known
throughout the country, because they
looked the most competent team offer-
ing and because they had and used the
usual advantages of incumbents.
Truong Dinh Dzu’s position as
runner-up astounded local observers.
Almost without exception they had put
Huong and Suu ahead. And yet Dzu
was throughout the campaign the most
vigorous, articulate opponent of the
Government. He had by far the most
effective campaign style. At meetings
he followed a set formula. A cheer
squad would be on hand to respond
to his gesticulations. He would start
by identifying himself with the region
in which he was speaking: “I was a
student here in Hue,” “In my 12 years
in this city of Saigon . . .” Again and
again he would declare: “I am the
opponent of Ky,” and he would sub-
stantiate this by out-abusing all the
other candidates abusing the Govern-
ment. Like the rest he was for “peace”
but he emphasised it by adopting the
dove as a symbol. When the rest spoke
cliches about social and economic im-
provement, he got down to specifics: “I
will clear your streets of rotting gar-
bage. I will get rid of pools of stag-
nant mess. I will build decent hospitals.
I will clean up the police . . .”
He undoubtedly took much of the
“protest vote” which was expected to
go to the older politicians Suu and
Huong.
And his organisation, around the Tan
Dai Viet party was obviously effective
in getting votes from Ha Thuch Ky,
the man expected to dominate Central
Vietnam.
The Communists have made obvious
their concern that successful elections
would strengthen the political and
diplomatic position of the Saigon
Government. In Hanoi, celebration of
the Democratic Republic’s “National
Day” was advanced from September 2
to August 31 in order to provide a
platform for anti-Saigon propaganda.
At the same time it gave great pub-
licity to what it described as an “extra-
ordinary meeting of the National
Liberation Front in the Liberated Area
of South Vietnam” in the middle of
August. This meeting had been con-
vened by its Central Committee to
discuss the political program, and
“over 200 delegates from all over South
Vietnam” turned up. It produced a
very long document, only the second
expansion of the Front’s “Ten Point
Program” since its establishment in
December 1960.
A typically turgid document, it is as
hardline as ever, dismissing negotia-
tions and saying that “the only course
is to continue stepping up the sacred
Top polling civilian candidate Dzu (leaning)
talks to Huong
war of resistance against U.S. aggres-
sion, for national salvation, till not a
single U.S. aggressor is left in our
beloved South Vietnam.” Under the
title “Concrete Policies,” it determines
the need “not to recognise the puppet
National Assembly rigged up by the
U.S. imperialists and their lackeys; to
abolish the constitution and all anti-
nationalist, anti-democratic laws enacted
by the U.S. imperialists and the puppet
administration.” It attempts, for the
first time, to match the Saigon Govern-
ment’s “Chieu Hoi,” or amnesty pro-
gram, by offering defectors good treat-
ment, and it also puts forward its own
equivalent of Saigon’s “National Recon-
ciliation. Program,” which offers VC
defectors equivalent positions should
they switch sides.
But it ends on a stern note, promising
to “severely punish the diehard thugs
acting as efficient agents of U.S.
imperialism.”
Officials in Saigon interpret the
program and its associated publicity as
a major propaganda offensive to
counter the effect of the successful
Government elections.

South Arabia
End or beginning?
THE ROT has set in in South Arabia
more swiftly than even the gloomiest of
prophets had predicted. The rebel
National Liberation Front (NLF)
finally emerged all-powerful to
announce its readiness to take over the
administration and negotiate a transfer
of power once Britain recognised the
NLF as the true representative of the
people.
The collapse of the authority of the
South Arabian Federal Government dis-
sipated any lingering British hopes that
the “Federalis,” the traditional local
sultans and sheiks who formed the
Government and leaned on Britain,
might continue to run South Arabia
and Aden when it becomes independent
after the British withdrawal scheduled
for next January 9. This exit may now
be sooner than it would have been had
not terrorism finally triumphed.
The most prominent leader of the
NLF is Qahtan Ashaabi, who was chief
director of an Arab terror squad respon-
sible for killing scores of the NLF’s
Arab nationalist rivals and 56 British
servicemen.
Ashaabi, 47, dark and unshaven, a
hitherto implacable enemy of Britain,
has stayed largely in the shadows, but
he came out into the open, flanked by
three other NLF leaders, to make his
demands for Britain to withdraw recog-
nition of the old Federal Government.
He said the NLF had cadres efficient
enough to administer the whole of
South Arabia. The NLF’s other condi-
tions for negotiations with the British
were the release of political detainees,
the lifting of the state of emergency,
and the immediate withdrawal of British
troops.
As Ashaabi spoke out, 12 of the 17
small States of the Federation were
already under NLF control. Most of the
sultans, ministers, and ruling families
had been arrested or had left the
country.
The NLF’s rapid seizure of power
was attributable to two factors. First,
it succeeded in persuading the South
Arabian Federal Army to remain poli-
tically neutral. Second, it gained sup-
port of the tribesmen against local
rulers by showing sympathy with their
economic and social grievances. Inside
Aden itself, the NLF also increased its
influence in the trades-union movement,
formerly dominated by its chief nation-
alist rival, FLOSY (Front for Libera-
tion of Occupied South Yemen).
Last week it was certain that any
independent new State which emerges
from the chaos will have a radical
national type of government which is
unlikely to be subservient to either
Britain or Egypt. &
It has been hard enough for Britain
to stay in South Arabia getting out

won’t be easy, either. No sooner had
the British High Commissioner, Sir
Humphrey Trevelyan, indicated willing-
ness to talk about the future than the
NLF backed up with more demands,
and its FLOSY opponents, reeling on
the ropes, complained about the way
things were going, too. Even the
defunct Federal Government Britain
had backed managed to get in its
squawk of protest, too.
Insisting that Britain wind up its
military, political, and economic affairs
as a pre-condition to talks, the NLF,
after a four-year fight for supremacy,
seemed in no mood for concessions to
anyone. But in the cause of starting in-
dependence off with at least a chance of
working, Britain still has a card to
play. She has promised not only some
external aid for South Arabia, after
quitting, but also £l5 million over the
first three years to maintain the coun-
try’s defence budget. Every penny of
aid will be needed whatever Govern-
ment is in power, for the economy of
Aden will be devastated by the with-
drawal of British troops, and if the
Suez canal remains closed much longer
even Aden’s port may never regain all
its old trade.
The NLF must secure the loyalty
of the Federal Army for the sake of
stability and Britain might use her aid
to encourage the NLF to a discreet
bargain with the Army.
But even in the quagmire that was
South Arabian politics last week, the
most hopeful sign was probably the
one that seemed most ominous at first
glance the emergence of the NLF
as the dominant political force. At
least the future is open again, which
is more than most people would have
predicted last May when Sir Humphrey
Trevelyan was called from retirement
to supervise the last eight months of
South Arabia’s murky road to indepen-
dence. At last, with an established
leader in the struggle to inherit Britain’s
old power, a new chance arises of
creating a viable Government before the
Union Jack* comes down in Aden.
Indonesia
Resurgent Reds?
HOW STRONG is communist power

never far from the surface since the
unheroic collapse of the Communist
Party (PKI) in the abortive coup of
September 30, 1965, which speeded
Sukarno on his downhill path, was be-
ing asked openly again last week. The
reason was that Acting President
Suharto has been busy widening his
anti-communist campaign.

of. two subversive organisations whieh
reportedly took their instructions from
the Chinese Embassy, in the capital.
Under arrest in the Celebes were 40
members of a gang accused of trying
to start a new PKI. And in West
Kalimantan, Borneo, the authorities
reported the apprehension of a ter-
rorist group who had killed Service per-
sonnel in an attack on an Air Force
base there three months ago.
And, back in Djakarta after tour-
ing Central Java, a KAMI (student)
group member of the House of Repre-
sentatives claimed that pro-Sukarno
Leftist elements were advocating rebel-
lion in Central Java, and had begun
using minor clashes to test their pow'er.
The collapse of the Indonesian Com-
munists, after the disastrous September
30 coup, w'as due to a premature call
to rebellion, based, perhaps in turn, 'on
faidty judgment. Now, after a period
of despair, a certain consolidation of
communist ranks is apparently taking
shape. Some of the leaders are demon-
strating more courage and self-con-
fidence before the courts than they did
a year ago.
A new' Central Committee of the
PKI seems to have been established in
Djakarta, or perhaps in Central Java.
The Party line has switched to radical-
ism. Since only China is willing to
support the Indonesian Communists’
struggle against the “fascist gang of
Suharto-Nasution,” it is the Chinese
road to power which has to be pro-
claimed. The Russian Communists are
behaving extremely cautiously, and
appear to be playing a game of “wait
and see.” But the last word has not
yet been said. The chances of China’s
success in building tip another PKI
appear dubious. An Indonesian Com-
munist Party with a Chinese face and
heart would provoke hostility among
Indonesians of all social strata, united
as they are by anti-Chinese feeling.
A new-style PKI may well be able
to establish some armed revolutionary
bases in distant areas, such as Kaliman-
tan, Borneo, or the outer islands, and
perhaps even in Java, but these will
probably be of little significance. The
radical Moslem Darul Islam movement
maintained itself for about ten years in
rebellion without changing the course
of history in Indonesia. Armed, des-
perate men of the Peking brand of
Communism may succeed in some ter-
rorist hit-and-run activities.
But the shock of the abortive com-
munist putsch, and the annihilation of
most of the old senior cadres, seem
to have been too severe for a full-
fledged communist • renaissance in
Indonesia. Communist infiltration into
existing parties would probably be a
much more dangerous tactic, even
though, from the Reds’ viewpoint, a
revisionist one. Communism, new- or
old-style, appears to have a real chance
again only when Indonesia’s New Order
is seen to have failed to provide the
common man’s daily bowl of rice.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Shearston leaves the scene
By SANDRA HALL
FOR SOME TIME NOW the folk
scene has been deserted, the minstrels
have wandered on. Those darkened
havens of coffee and guitars have turned
into discotheques or shops selling
fashionably scrubbed furniture. And
now the longest-established and most
enduring of all the minstrels is going
abroad.
Yet, although Gary Shearston is still
wearing his elastic-sided boots, the
purists are probably saying he really
abandoned the scene some time ago
last year, in fact, when traditional
music turned sour on him, and he took
six months off “to think about doing
what I really wanted to do.” (He leaves
for Britain this week in pursuit of what
he wahts to do.)
The carefully researched bush ballads
and his faithful re-creations of them no
longer held the same enchantment for
him, and so he felt the need to try
something new. “I picked a strange
time to change my mind about it, too
right in the middle of a song I was
doing on an Arts Council tour. But
I’d been doing the same thing for too
long and I had to stop. So I locked
myself away in my house in Balmain for
six months and just thought.”
The result is a more forceful Shear-
ston sound than that of the protest
songs and bush ballads, and music that
contains the kind of experimentation
which has a place in the new-style pop
music, but not in legitimate folk songs,
“Some singers can go on doing tradi-
tional songs and can give them some-
thing new every time. I don’t know
how they do it, but I know I can’t.”
If people hit him with the charge
of “going commercial,” Shearston says,
“Let them. Let them do what they want
and I’ll do what I want.” But his
feelings about his musical development
are really not quite as casual as that,
To him, the folk boom is not over, it’s
just moved on to enrich pop music
and give it the direction folk exponents
always wanted it to take.
“The folk music of the day” is too
facile a definition for him to stomach,
but he thinks the Beatles and the rest,
with their Eleanor Rigbys and their
pop hymns to the love generation, are
transmitting messages as potent as the
most vehement protest song. “It’s as if
they’d got an old printing press, put
out their own broadsheet, and sold it
on street corners.”
Shearston is hardly a survivor of the
folk boom he sang before it, through
it, and after it. “The only difference it
made was that for
a while we were
getting paid a lot
of money for
something we’d
always done. We
rode the crest of
a wave.
“At the begin-
ning, I suppose
there were ten or
ll of us singing
at the Troubador
good, compe-
tent performers—
and the people
who came to
listen were given
a good evening’s
entertainment.
“Then other
places opened. It
was so easy for
cafes to clear a
space in the cor-
ner and put in
some long-haired
bird with a guitar
who fancied she
could sing like
Joan Baez. No, it
didn’t harm us. I
suppose it did
some good in a way, because the kids
who learned the guitar then are good
now.”
At 28, he admits his is a less angry
protest than it once was. “I am still an
idealist, but I have become aware that
I cannot afford as many ideals as I’d
like. You could say I’ve learnt over-
indulgence in humanitarian feeling can
lead to injury.
“We used to sing awful slogan-bash-
ing songs, because we believed them
and because people wanted to hear
them. But we didn’t try to influence
people, because we didn’t believe it was
possible. I still don’t think it’s pos-
sible for an Australian entertainer to
wield an influence, but I think it is
for some of the magnitude of Peter,
Paul and Mary.”
Like so many of his contemporaries
who have made a pastime out of stick-
ing pins into complacency, Shearstoit
went to an independent school. But,
unlike the Walshes, the Nevilles, and
the Sheads, with their comfortable,
middle-class city backgrounds, he spent
most of his childhood in the country,
coming to Sydney only after his family
had suffered an unlucky season on the
land.
“I resented going to a GPS school,
because I felt my parents were making
an unnecessary sacrifice for some-
thing they wanted and I didn’t. The
school did do one thing for me, though
it put me in the cadet corps and
gave me a hatred for the Army. Here
I was able to handle field guns,
.3035, hand grenades a 17-year-old
turned into a piece of precision. I didn’t
like it.”
After school came odd jobs with an
automotive-spare-parts company and a
sportsgoods store, while he waited to
start work as a journalist with United
Press International. He spent several
years there, but the occasional singing
dates increased and Hayes Gordon’s
Ensemble Theatre claimed more of his
time until these were no longer
part-time jobs.
He returned to the Ensemble last
year to do a play, and has recently
appeared in one of the ABC’s Austra-
lian Playhouse productions “Enough
to Make a Pair of Sailor’s Trousers.”
“I’ll take anything that comes along
and looks good. To be frank, I took
the part in that play because I couldn’t
resist playing a poultry farmer from
Wagga.”
To his delight, the Arts Council has
been quick to accept the new Shearston
music (“at one time there were even
suggestions about introducing contem-
porary popular music into school con-
certs”), and for his last tour it used
a program note written by Shearston’s
friend, Michael Thomas. Perhaps, com-


ing as it does from a friend, it is the
best answer to the purists.
“Gary has been singing songs and
the songs made sense; now he is sing-
ing beautiful music and the music
makes you laugh and makes you cry:
he is somebody to be afraid of and
somebody to celebrate, and everything
is just the way it ought to be.”
Theatre
Student throwout
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Little Malcolm and His Struggle
Against the Eunuchs. David Halliwell.
Dramsoc. Union Theatre. Sydney
University.
THE FACT that this is a contemporary
play about students, performed by
students for student audience, is surely
part of the reason for the excellent
liveliness of Aarne Neeme’s production.
The acting is skilled, but as well as this
the actors seem very much at home in
the play. Student theatre in Sydney has
been in the doldrums for so long that
it is a great pleasure to see such a
talented group.
Malcolm Scrawdyke is not so much
a dropout as a throwout: after five
years as a disaffected art student on a
government grant at the Huddersfield
Technical College, he has just been
expelled. Plotting revenge in his attic,
he first bullies and cajoles two admiring
friends into resigning from the Art
School in sympathetic protest and then
enlists them in a revolutionary party
“to do battle with the eunuchs.” This
boils down to a plot to kidnap and
humiliate the offending art teacher.
The Party develops into a kind of
miniature Nazi Party. It is short on
ideology, but makes up with ritual and
regulations. The main action consists
in the three revolutionaries, plus an
aspiring novelist called Nipple, acting
out their fantasies of violence with the
aid of badges, banners, armbands, and
a ragged Nazi salute, culminating in a
kind of Moscow Trial of the unfor-
tunate Nipple. It is. all very colorful
and theatrical and sinister and funny,
but what is the point?
The upshot is that the plotters do
absolutely nothing. It is all fantasy. The
girl whom Scrawdyke admires, but is
terrified of, sees through them: they
are all bluster and scared stiff of girls.
The play ends with a whimpering
Scrawdyke, but it looks as though he
will summon up the courage to ask the
girl to the pictures after the play ends.
Well, that is nice. But David Halli-
well’s implication that the terrifying
totalitarian systems of the twentieth
century were built up by little men
with a gift of the gab because they
were scared of women, while a simple
and convenient theory of history, is
unlikely to appeal to historians.
David Halliwell, like a lot of
dramatists writing nowadays, has a
genuine theatrical flair and an easy
flow of dramatic rhetoric, but lacks in-
tellectual force. This makes for lively
and colorful theatre, but it is lacking
in nourishment.
This production will move to the
Turner Hall from September 13th to
16th and to the University of New
South Wales Theatrette from September
22nd to 24th.

TV.
IT WOULD BE EASY to gather from
the Australian Playhouse series that it
is impossible for Australians to write a
half-hour TV play capable of satisfy-
ing a moderately demanding viewer.
Other nations can do it, especially in
the humor range, often with to
work over an old theme teams of
two writers, flint and steel minds which
spark good situations and dialogue.
One example, “Occasional Wife,” pre-
ceded last week’s Playhouse in Syd-
ney. Four or five sketches were
zipped around the stock, skeletal situ-
ation, with narrator’s voice behind the
stopped frames which ended each
sketch, and the whole added up to a
trifling but at least occasionally amus-
ing story. But Oriel Gray’s “Brass
Guitar” in Playhouse was a fussy,
fancy, rather desperate essay into
quirky humor which failed mainly
because it needed sharp dialogue but
had nothing more original than, “This
boy has nightmares that could win
Melbourne Cups.” In its favor: Alan
Clarke’s op art set, and Terry Mc-
Dermott’s appearance as a raincoated,
very Orstralian detective.
McDermott, ex-“ Homicide,” played
a much more useful part the previous
Wednesday night in Sydney (last Wed-
nesday in Melbourne) in Newcastle
journalist Ron Harrison’s “Ride On the
Big Dipper,” which was what TV
drama should be. McDermott gave a
well-paced, intelligent performance as
an efficiency - Frankenstein who got
clobbered by his own mother in the
cold, bloodless mayhem of business.
Nothing novel or exciting in the plot,
but everything so in seeing it in Aus-
tralian terms; a believable drama of
the times, with believable dialogue.
As it was Harrison’s second TV play,
and his first one-hour drama, I can
only echo the ABC’s Phillip Mann,
who said, “It was the kind of work
we receive all too rarely, and we hope
he intends to stay with it.” A sense of
drama seems to be the rare old some-
thing he’s got, and here’s hoping he is
a stayer, because he seems to have the
field to himself.

A NEW RECORDING of “Elisir
d’Amore” has been long overdue and
there was every reason to expect a lot
from this set. The opera is a joy for
ever and almost foolproof in its many
comic and light passages. The differ-
ence between a good and a superb per-
formance lies in the romantic passages
which supplement the comic. Mario
Sereni and Renata Capecchi make the
most of the latter. Mirella Freni’s Mimi
gave one cause to expect a perfect
Adina; she turns out to be merely a
good one. Nicolai Gedda disappoints
more. His Nemorino lacks the pure
vocal line of the ideal Italian voice and
he does not bring across the pathetic
charm of this one operatic tenor role
which has real character. Gedda is one
of our best singers today, but he is
being pushed too much and too often.
Nevertheless, this is still the best “Elisir
d’Amore” to date and chances of a
better in the foreseeable future are
small.
The issue of “Lucrezia Borgia” will be
welcomed, if only because RCA classi-
cal releases are scarcer than hens’ teeth
in this country. Flow one of the world’s
greatest recording organisations can


neglect the Australian market' as it does
is one of the great mysteries of high
finance; or has low finance something
to do with it? Montserrat Caballe is
one of the two singers who have the
potential to replace Maria Callas. Per-
haps an obscure opera like “Lucrezia
Borgia” is not the best vehicle to launch
this ship, but the conclusion is inescap-
able that Callas at Caballe’s point of
career would have made this set a
runaway best-seller. Caballe does not.
She has a beautiful voice which is dead
right for the part. But the runs are not
clean and there is little characterisation.
Her tenor, Alfredo Kraus, is good and
so is the rest of the cast. The opera itself
is the usual confection of infectious
Donizetti tunes without the dramatic
depth of “Lucia di Lammermoor.” It is
a valuable addition to any operatic col-
lection and as such can be heartily
recommended.

IT IS A DUBIOUS pleasure to see
the film of a book you admire as
sincerely as I do Richard McKenna’s
“The Sand Pebbles”; but Robert Wise’s
screen version seems to me to have
so little reference to its original that it
didn’t annoy me at all. I found it a
decorative, slow-moving but reasonably
entertaining adventure story which only
occasionally inspired the fleeting
thought: Why, that reminds me of a
scene in that fine book.
The novel, set in China in the late
’2os, presents a meticulous dissection
of the character of Holman, chief
engineer on a superannuated U.S. Navy
gunboat a born loner, a man who
longs to belong but is prevented by his
lifelong training in solitude and his
stubborn refusal to consider other
people as anything but individuals with-
out reference to their accents, color, or
political views. It also gives an aston-
ishing picture of a political situation
of which I, for one, knew nothing, and
which makes later events considerably
more explicable.
Wise’s movie has understandably had
to condense the action of the novel, and
has pretty well discarded the entire
consideration of the political rights and
wrongs, contenting itself with establish-
ing the Americans as the goodies and
the Chinese as well, perhaps not
baddies, but at any rate wrong-headies.
Similarly, the character of Holman is
inadequately explained, beyond a hint
that he had an unhappy childhood
(though his Mom, fortunately, was “a
good dame”).
Yet, despite the deficiencies of the
script, Steve McQueen gives a remark-
ably impressive performance in the
central role. Though the character,
through no fault of the actor’s, remains
enigmatic, it is always believable and
even sympathetic.
Most of the others fare less well, with
roles that are practically caricatures
nobody could blame Richard Crenna,
for instance, for his inability to make
scene out of the ludicrously written role
of the captain, who talks about nothing
but Honor and The Flag and in general
behaves like a loony.
Even though Wise has compressed
the action of the book, he has also man-
aged to make it too long by dragging
out pretty well every sequence far past
its moment of dramatic impact; and
he and his expert cameraman, Joseph
MacDonald, haven’t been able to resist
a willow-pattern picturesqueness in the
background shots.
The first sequences of “The Leather
Boys,” in which background and char-
acters are established, are almost
amateurish, but we have to remember
that we’re seeing the movie some three
years after its making, and in the
meantime English film-makers have
become much more expert in these
scenes from working-class life. Here the
characters are almost caricatured
Rita Tushingham’s earlier scenes are
completely unconvincing (the fault of
the script, not the actress).
The whole thing is a slapdash piece
of film-making, but there’s a good deal
of emotional depth in the later
sequences of this story of a boy who
after a too-youthful marriage to a
pretty, irresponsible flibbertigibbet
finds a true and rewarding friendship
with another youth. Their growing
affection is delicately but not romantic-
ally presented; and though the young
husband’s final discovery of the sexual
undercurrents in their association lacks
subtlety, the wordless farewell of the
friends is genuinely sad and moving.
The film is a failure, but an honorable
and interesting one.
Art
Melbourne moves
By ELWYN LYNN
Peter Dickie. Tolarno Galleries, Mel-
bourne.
Ken Reinhard. South Yarra Gallery,
Melbourne.
Prints. Crossley Gallery, Melbourne.
Print Council Prize. National Gallery
of Victoria, Melbourne.
THERE IS A curious disunity in the
art world of Melbourne. No doubt it
arises from the dispersal of galleries
and the near, but necessary, chaos that
prevails at the National Gallery where
everyone is projecting their lives across
the Yarra to the Cultural Centre; but
it’s a city without an ideological
centre. In Sydney the galleries are
closer in and one is more aware of
movements; in fact, the Central Street
Gallery, with its appropriate name, is
committed to one kind of art, and
lately the Art Gallery of N.S.W. has
taken initiative from the dealers and
has become the venue of visual
activities.
Peter Dickie’s tormented pop-imagery
recalls the cohesion that Blackman,
Perceval, Boyd, and Tucker once gave
the art world, even though his work,
strident and vigorous with multiple
images, is in itself the antithesis of
cohesion. As he has something of the
Gareth - Sansom - Baldessin approach,
there is plenty of slithering flesh,
entrail ribbons, proliferating bulges,
unpredictable tubular. movements,
“tough” picture collages and the com-
mon obeisance to Bacon, especially in
The Director in the Dark Room, where
a swirling, inchoate, violently slashed
pink form splendidly restates the
emotional force of action painting and
fierce color.
In the huge Castle and the Country-
side he pushes a reddened, pink form
like a flood of smashed pipes into the
corner underneath a vast black sky. It
looks as though a surreal automobile
must have struck a Bacon on the
D’Arcangelo highway, and has a surge
of violent mania found in most of his
works; indeed, Mamma Mania with its
convulsion of pink bodies and Bye Bye
Love (Bye Bye Sweet Caress) with its
silhouette of Mandrake and lady who
is not topless but bottomless, are full of
those zany, incoherent clues one finds
in a Saul or Telemarque. Ritual to a
French Discus Thrower has a half-halo
of discus hurlers above a torso in green
disintegration; the discus throwers’
hurling circle drips blood. What it’s
about eludes me, but certainly man can-
not live by sport alone, or by circuses,
for that matter, for Circus Twist, with
its blue arm across a black void and
the figures so falsely bright, has an un-
easy, enigmatic twist.
What look like twisted entrails in
one work become gay streamers in Re-
flection of a Pool with a man and his
camera crossing the bright green to
church while a crane lifts a smashed
car and the stages of pregnancy are
shown in a series of collages. If the
paintings were not so frenzied and so
full of Melburnian instant-impact they
might recall a Bosch gone Pop; Dickie
certainly uses collage as Bosch used
symbols. In Just Out that Door and
Upon the Hill the disparate, meaning-
less lives of humans are linked by huge
pipes as though all life surged through
subterranean and celestial tunnels.
There is nothing of the chic and kinky
Pop of London here; in If I Don’t For-
get I Think I’ll Go Mad, with its car,

I’ve appraised Reinhard before and only

Carnaby Street had set up an outpost
in Antarctica; when he lets his tubes
follow the contours of a silk-screened

sensuous delight ensues.

It raises the question: is not the
work of such a gallery, devoted to

importance? The variety, intensity, and
desire to experiment revealed in its

Music
Team troubles
By PAUL FROLICH
Andre Gertler, violin, and Diane
Andersen, piano. Town Hall, Sydney.
THERE hi AYE BEEN previous occa-
sions, as during Igor Oistrakh’s Aus-
tralian tour in 1963, that made one
doubt the rightness of husband-and-wdfe
teams for concert appearances. The
finest ensembles of this kind have
usually consisted of great artists who, off
the platform, led independent lives
Lili Kraus and Simon Goldberg, Stern
and Zakin, Francescatti and Casadesus
are among those that come to mind.
The team of Andre Gertler and Diane
Andersen is not, alas, as successful. The.
husband is a Hungarian-born Belgian,
the wife a Belgian-trained Dane. He
plays the violin in a curiously and
attractively old-fashioned manner,
strongly reminiscent of Bronislav
Hubermann in his stance, his bowing,
and some of his odd intonations. She
plays the piano in a thoroughly modern,
percussive, and heavy-pedalling style.
Where Gertler is introspective and
seems to be searching for the inner-
most meaning of a phrase, Miss Ander-
sen appears content to follow the com-
poser’s score and instructions faithfully
and accurately, careful not to add any-
thing of her own personality to the
music.
Recordings and broadcasts had con-
vinced me that Mr. Gertler is quite a
remarkable musician and in works such
as the Bartok and Berg violin concetti
he stands almost unequalled. In the
event, though the program was adven-
turously chosen, the concert fell short
of success.
The first piece was a two-movement
sonata fragment by Mozart, K. 402, not
previously performed in Sydney as far
as I am aware. The work begins with
a slow movement, hardly an encourag-
ing start. The work itself is rather in-
determinate, vacillating between pre-
dictable Mozart and fugal echoes of
Bach. Mr. Gertler tried to enter into
the spirit of Bach, but his partner
played and pedalled in a romantic 19th-
century manner.
This was followed by Bartok’s Violin
Sonata No. 1, of 1921, which I’d last
heard in 1955, played by Maurice Clan'
and Hepzibah Menuhin. Mr. Gertler’s
undisputed authority in Bartok now
came to the fore and we were rewarded
with quite a convincing interpretation,
with clear development of the folk-
elements which enter even Bartok's
most abstruse music.
The third sonata programmed was
Janacek’s No. 3, completed in 1914,
which turned out to be one of Jan-
acek’s most ingratiating works, wholly
coherent and permeated with charac-
teristic Moravian melodies. The son-
ata is distinguished by some brilliant
writing for the violin and proved that
Mr. Gertler’s is an instrument capable
of producing very beautiful sound.
It was in the final work, Brahms’ D
minor Sonata, Opus 108, that we heard
the best of the teamwork. In this
highly dramatic music, oozing emotion,
the two players maintained a near-
perfect balance and Miss Andersen's
percussive style asserted itself success-
fully, even if she could not hope to
match her husband's impassioned im-
petuosity in the Adagio. Unfortunately,
it is a fact that wdiat sounds best on
the violin is rarely suitable for the
piano, and vice versa. The recital gave
four separate demonstrations of how-
various composers have tried to solve
this almost insuperable conflict, and if
the players appeared to remain dis-
united the blame should not be wholly
theirs.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A breakthrough for Cliffs, and
more local equity?
CLIFFS WESTERN Australia Mining
Co. are negotiating what will be one
of the biggest minerals deals in history.
The operation will become bigger than
those of the Hamersley Iron or Mount
Newman groups and will involve an
initial contract worth more than $l3OO
million. Colossal as this figure is, there
is perhaps greater significance in the
fact that Cliffs are working with
limonitic ores. There is several times as
much limonite in the West as there
is the higher-grade haematite. Until this
contract, it had not been firmly estab-
lished that limonite was a commercial
proposition. In fact, only a few weeks
ago informed opinion gave Cliffs very
little hope of getting off the ground
because of the technical and financial
problems the group faced alone.
Western Australia’s Premier, Mr.
David Brand, recognised the extent of
the breakthrough when he said the
contract would open up many millions
of tons of limonitic ores for export. As
anticipated, Cliffs have changed their
export outlet from Cape Preston to
Cape Lambert, which Mr. Brand be-
lieves will become one of the biggest
industrial complexes in the north of
Australia. By exporting through Cape
Lambert, Cliffs will be crossing Hamers-
ley Iron’s haulage line between Mount
Tom Price and Dampier. This will open
the way to an agreement between the
two groups to use each other’s port if
one becomes inoperable. Mr. Charles
Court, Minister for Industrial Develop-
ment, sees this as “of great importance
to the general security of the area both
so far as the companies and the buyers
are concerned.”
A cash flow will start for Cliffs when
their limonite fines begin to move. The
contract as reported from Tokyo gives
them a 3.5 million ton throughput
annually for 15 years, with a price of
10.75 U.S. cents per unit for this ore-
dust, with its 56-57 percent iron con-
tent. About a year later the pellets will
start to shift at the rate of 4.2 million
tons annually over 21 years; these will
have been upgraded to an iron content
of 63-64 percent. The acceptance of
limonite fines, even at what might ap-
pear to be a low price, is a major
advance with significant long-term im-
plications for the industry.
Before the contract was re-negotiated,
Cliffs’ price was 19.1 U.S. cents per
unit for pellets, with a throughput of
3.6 million tons annually. So this could
answer the first question that arises
from last week’s report of the offer:
will it be accepted? The price reduc-
tion is considerable; the announcement
came, not from Cliffs, who have been
reticent about their new scheme, but
from the Japanese steel mills. It would
seem that the offer is as good as
accepted.
The second big question leaves much
more room for speculation. Who will
participate in the new Cliffs consort-
ium? And on this no answer is likely
for some time perhaps not until the
end of the year. The original Cliffs
was comprised of Cleveland Cliffs Iron
Co., of Ohio, with 51 percent, Mitsui
and Co., of Japan, with 35, Garrick
Agnew Pty. Ltd., percent (Agnew
prospected the area and then brought
in Cleveland Cliffs), leaving percent
of the equity swinging. Not only is
this to be allocated, but there are indica-
tions of a major re-carving of the Cliffs
cake. Daniel K. Ludwig’s National Bulk
Premier Brand: millions of tons.
Carriers and oil companies Esso and
Gulf have been mentioned among
negotiators for a slice; Agnew is be-
lieved to be hoping to increase his stake,
and there is strong speculation that
whatever he gets will become part of
a public company, which he will con-
trol.
Charles Court has said he believes
Australians will get “considerably more
than 1\ percent,” while refusing to be
brought into the matter further than to
say that he will be meeting Cleveland
Cliffs’ principals before they go to
Tokyo in mid-September. Llis attitude
that the less said about this the better
is familiar; it has, in the past, been a
prelude to a Court coup. Even more
than the originally available 14 percent
is likely to go to Australia.
Cliffs’ image has changed remarkably
since the group first set up. Its stocks
were high when it negotiated the most
lucrative of the iron-ore contracts.
They fell when BHP moved out to
manage Mount Newman, leaving be-
hind only one-half of what was planned
as a Robe River partnership, as well
as the impression that limonite was
simply not a technically feasible
proposition a view which Garrick
Agnew refused to accept. Since then
the consortium has worked quietly and
most efficiently to its present position.
The gold bug
Pigeonholed at IMF
YES, LIKE HIS predecessors in the
annual flight of the Federal Treasurer
to the World Bank and IMF meetings,
Mr. McMahon is going to espouse the
case for an increase in the price of
gold. This is right and proper, but, even
with Mr. lan Shannon beside him to
give him the points of the case,
McMahon isn’t likely to get very far
with it.
When Mr. McMahon confronts his
opposite numbers from other countries
at the meetings he will find that the
question of whether to increase the
price of gold is hardly on most of their
minds. This is because, from last week’s
meetings of finance ministers and
central bankers in London, has emerged
an agreed plan, albeit a cautious one,
for supplementing the world’s existing
monetary reserves. It has taken four
years of study and two years of inten-
sive negotiations to find this way of
creating some species of international
monetary reserves out of thin air. This
being so (and about time, you say!),
the gold price question is going to be
pigeonholed.
Though the plan is still a skeleton
and would only acquire flesh on specific
agreement that a shortage of reserves
existed, it provides for a new special
drawing rights (SDRs) administered
by the International Monetary Fund.
Countries would be able to save these
SDRs in the same way as they keep
reserves and to encourage them to keep
them, or at least not to get rid of them
too quickly, they would carry a modest
rate of interest. They would be distribut-
able in annual amounts to all members
(106 at present) of the IMF in propor-
tion to their quotas or subscriptions in
the Fund.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy : August’s international trade threw
out a current account deficit of $10.8m., against July’s
$26.9m. surplus (both figures seasonally adjusted). Imports
jumped from $238.7m. to $285m., while exports went from
$265.6m. to $274.2m.
Merino wool prices gained 2| percent over the week’s sales.
For the markets : While industrials remained broadly
firm on Australian share markets, a little nervousness became
visible towards the close. Miners have not wholly regained
their strength.
Equities in London found a buoyant week after the
Government’s, reflationary proposals . . . Wall Street looks
mixed as it tries to take the motor strike into account.
For companiesS Iron ore assumed a further vivid
glow from Hamersley’s new $2 70m. contract with the Jap-
anese steel mills —40 m. tons (30m. tons of ore fines and
10m. tons of lump), deliveries to go over 10 years from
October, 1969; overall terms are within the old Federal
Government guidelines for export . . . Cleveland Cliffs Iron
Co. is soon to complete negotiations in Japan involving 140 m.
tons of pellets and fines from Robe River sources.
Earnings of tin miner Aberfoyle Holdings fell back from
$643,198 to $320,574 in 1966-67, on which percent was
paid; directors still intend another dividend before the close
of 1967 . . . Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie dropped heavily by
$259,806 to $446,000, principally because of lower grades;
the 1966-67 year saw five percent dividend, but no half-
yearly payment will be made next December.
Developers were brightened by L. J. Hooker’s repeated
improvement, to $1,206,000 after the previous year’s $765,000,
on very conservative accounting procedures; directors con-
template a final dividend for 1967-68 . . . Sydney project
builder James Wallace has switched a $725,069 loss into a
$157,338 profit and had slBm. of work in hand at balance
date.
Textile interests looked well when Brack Mills weighed in
with a $164,392 advance to $918,389 and kept payout at
12£ percent; earning rate goes to 36.9 percent . . . Felt and.
Textiles could not be kept down either, moving up from
$1,557,533 to $1,815,732, thus arresting three years of decline
. . . Then came Yarra Falls’ $282,496 profit and a four per-
cent payment after a three-year dividend gap.
Our largest woolbroker, Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort,
has pushed dividend up by 1 percent to 11 percent following
a 14 percent earnings gain (to $5,988,226 and a 25 percent
earning rate) . . . Cresco Fertilizers went significantly from
$659,830 to $1,052,840, holding 10 percent on higher capital.
Abnormal weather, higher costs, and irrational competition
beset food processor Petersville as profit slipped from
$1,760,207 to $1,565,478, yet 12|- percent remains.
Retailer Myer Emporium brings its dividend from 17J to
20 percent, the highest since listing; pre-tax profit and sales
are at a peak ... In Sydney, David Jones was steady at
$4,766,229 (previously $4,736,814); so was the 13J percent
dividend.
Concrete Industries (Monier) still contemplates “very
substantial” losses on the North West Cape project, whatever
satisfaction comes from claims and “extraordinary relief.”
Fire fighter Wormald Brothers slipped badly from $875,107
to $533,426; the dividend was knocked from eight to four
percent . . . G. E. Crane held its 14 percent, although earn-
ings dropped from $1,130,822 to $930,369; copper price
fluctuations provide the main explanation.
Australian Chemicals executed an 81 percent recovery to
$726,018; the 10 percent was unaffected.
MEN AND MATTERS
NOBODY KNOWS their oats better in
Australia than seventy-year-old Clyde
Edwin Clements, chairman and manag-
ing director of the proprietary company
bearing his name. Before he left last
week for Peru (he is its honorary
consul in Melbourne), he said he wasn’t
sure whether the President of that
country or himself would be opening
the company’s new grain-processing mill
(a joint venture with Peruvian interests)
at Lima. From there he was going to
Chile to negotiate the expansion of ship-
ping facilities with South America, and
then flying over to Kuala Lumpur to
open his company’s new mill there, and
-on to Japan for more business calls.
The upshot of all these developments
makes Mr. Clements’ show Australia’s
biggest oat grain processor and, after
Quaker, the second biggest around the
globe. The new accent is on cooked
grain in bulk rather than bags, and
export trade has risen to s4m. to
Malaysia and Peru alone.
This is big business for a $300,000
company, but it also has bigger money
in it, said Mr. Clements; he wouldn’t
let us say whose. At the Australian end
it must be pretty influential, because the
Melbourne Harbor Trust is currently
building three silos for its exclusive use
on a rental basis (the Peruvian Govern-
ment is coughing up also with new
wharf facilities at Lima).
Mr. Clements came originally from
Tasmania, but is now well and truly
a member of the Melbourne establish-
ment. A veteran of World War I, his
local interests over the years have
covered high office in the YCW move-
ment, the RAC, the Australian Auto
Association, and the Tourist Develop-
ment Authority. He’s a member of the
exclusive West Brighton Club, among
others, and he lives down that way, too.

The "Free List" Drug Business
Moving quickly into Exports
By J. C. HORSFALL
(Continued from last week)
THE DIRECTOR - GENERAL of
Health, Sir William Refshauge, in his
report for 1966-67 issued last week
pointed the bone for the rising cost
of the free-list drug bill more at the
doctors for prescribing too many of the
more-expensive drugs on the free list
than at the manufacturers for their
prices in supplying them. This gave a
rather more balanced picture of the
rights and wrongs of the mounting
cost of free-list drugs (prescription
medicine is the word preferred by the
industry) than we’ve been given lately
by some unofficial spokesman in the
drug play. While the main implica-
tion from the report, which reveals that
expenditure rose by 11.4 percent to
$101.3m (a slightly higher figure than
given in the Budget papers) compared
with a rise of 9.4 percent the previous
year, is that the onus is on doctors to
prescribe less - expensive drugs, the
Department can hardly fail to redouble
its efforts to bring the prices charged
by the drug companies down. Nor,
after the report, can the chemists be
at all hopeful of getting the increase
in dispensing fees they’re looking for
from the Government.
Turning quickly from the highly
charged “political” issues of the drug
bill to some of the economic advant-
ages conferred on us by the industry,
the broadest, of course, stems from the
gains to national productivity flow-
ing from the use of drugs in the com-
munity. If you take the Commonwealth
Government’s drug bill at, say, $lOO
million, it is probably not stretching
the imagination to say that this is offset
entirely by gains in productivity arising
from the use of the drugs entailed in
it. Perhaps it is worth several times
that drug bill. As far as I know, no
calculations have been made for this
country for the offset, but in Britain,
as Sir Derek Dunlop, Emeritus Profes-
sor of Therapeutics and Clinical Medi-
cine in the University of Edinburgh,
who was out here last year, explained
in the following passage to an industry
audience, at least some estimates have
been made:
“The vast saving in mortality result-
ing from the use of modern drugs is
well documented,” he said, “but the
tremendous saving to national
economies which they have effected in
diminished morbidity, less time lost
from work, and fewer and shorter ad-
missions to hospital, is more difficult
to compute. Taking tuberculosis as an
example, however, it has been esti-
mated with fair accuracy that the sav-
ing to the economy of the .United King-
dom from the use of modern anti-
tuberculosis drugs is about $135 million
a year, or nearly half the annual drug
bill of Britain’s National Health Ser-
vice.” That, of course, is the produc-
tivity gain derived from the cure of one
disease alone. So if that from the use of
650 or so (the number fluctuates over
the year) free-list drugs were to be
calculated for Australia, it is pretty
obvious that the productivity offset
would be enormous.
There are other gains to the economy
from having the industry rather than
having to rely on imports. It employs
people, Australians mostly; it is con-
tributing to fixed capital investment
in a big way; it pays its share of taxa-
tion, and so on. But perhaps best of all
it is emerging as one of the fastest-
growing export industries.
In the past ten years exports of
drugs from Australia have increased
about fourfold. Most of this has
occurred in the past four years. And as
one would expect with the industry’s
striking growth (mainly in N.S.W., but
some big new plants like Squibb, for
instance, have recently been built in
Melbourne also), imports have been
reduced. Most of the exported drugs
are those on the free list of the pharma-
ceutical benefits scheme and a wide
variety of prescription products. The
projected $l6 million capital expansion
of the industry (its capital as invest-
ment at present, taking in all aspects
of the industry, is now around $l6O
million) is calculated to increase ex-
ports even more rapidly, especially to
South-East Asia, but by no means only
that area.
The range of export markets being
penetrated by the industry is extensive,
and the achievements of some indi-
vidual countries already most striking.
For instance, Abbott Laboratories,
which won the D of T export award
last year, has increased its exports ten-
fold in the past ten years, selling as far
afield as Britain, France, Belgium,
Pakistan, and India. Eli Lilly had no
exports five years ago, but last year its
total was getting up toward $1 million;
a figure already reached by Abbott.
Smith Kline and French, with no ex-
ports in 1960, is also nearing that figure,
and now has 20 overseas representa-
tives. Cyanamid-DHA and Pfizer have
like achievements. Merke, Sharp and
Dome has set its export target at $2.5
million for this financial year, five times
that achieved two years back. Its major
markets are NZ and South Africa, but
it has also been successful in South-East
Asian countries, Pakistan, Ceylon,
Kenya, and Fiji among other places.
Even if the pricing of products in
overseas markets by these companies is
not an open book, it seems highly
likely that the industry is looking for
higher profits per average unit of sales
than it is from sales in the Australian
domestic market under the high degree
of competition ruling in it. This,
coupled with the higher volume output
and attendant economies from it, should
assist efforts to get the price of free-
list drugs down. There may also be
scope for getting the companies to
dilute the charge they put into their
costs to pay for research. The industry
claims it makes on average slightly less
than ten percent net on its sales. Ad-
mittedly this may, compared with some
other industries, not be excessive, but is
it a fair thing to take eight cents out of
every sales dollar before arriving at that
figure? The answer probably lies some-
where in the proposition that there are
still many diseases unconquered by the
drugs of the therapeutic revolution, and
research must be continued on an even
more costly scale to find them. The
research chemists have not yet come
to the end of the spectrum.
This, particularly the research-based
companies in it, is an international
industry, just as surely as the oil in-
dustry, and it now sees Australia as a
base for launching an export assault
into Asia. It is good business for us to
have it here whether we like its proli-
feration, its prices, and some of its
practices or not. It is not now a question
of getting a better drug deal either in
free-list or balance-of-payments terms
by turning the clock back to reliance on
imports for the bulk of our drugs. The
industry, foreign-controlled and all, is
here to stay. We will have to live even
closer to it and bend it more to the
national advantage, even drive much
harder price bargains with it for its
supply of free-list drugs.
Price bargaining will not be a push-
over but, as Australia comprises only
about two percent of the world market
dominated by the U.S., Swiss, German,
and British research-based drug manu-
facturers, the prices they get for drugs
here is probably not too great a concern
for them in their world roll up. This
should work in our favor in squeezing
the industry a bit harder.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Getting the line
on economics
from a Hawke
BY J. C. HORSFALL
TAKING A LINE from the word the
Greeks in their City States had for it,
in the old days economics used to be
called political economy. When you
think hard on it or, say, listen to the
exposition Mr. Hawke gave on
economic and related matters on tele-
vision after the ACTU Congress, the
old appellation seems to fit the sub-
ject better than the modern one.
Although Mr. Hawke is, up to this
stage, to be regarded as a discarded
prospective politician, he had plenty
to say on what the ALP would do in
the economic arena if it got into power.
This could suggest that the industrial
wing, which, going on the voting at
the ACTU Congress, is veering to the
left, knows better what will happen
if the ALP gets in than the political
wing under Mr. Whitlam, with his
rightish predilections. Looking for
light, the impartial economic observer
remains rather bewildered. The ALP
could do with an authentic economics
spokesman to come to the centre of
the stage to tell us what really portends.
There’s probably not much to choose
between Mr. J. M. Riordan, of N.S.W.,
and Hawke on the industrial side as
best qualified for such a role. There
is no doubt about who is the less
reticent of these two to fill the bill.
Mr. Hawke’s self-assurance fascinates
me. It comes, I suppose, from his long
confrontations with Arbitration Com-
mission benches and earlier exercises
at Oxford where, as a Western Aus-
tralian Rhodes Scholar, he doubtless
felt obliged like most such scholars to
make a name for himself and equip
himself to carry the lifelong millstone
of a Rhodes around his neck. In the
circles he chose to make his career
he is something of a deus ex machina
and must have felt acutely, especially
early on, that intellectuals are not
exactly persona grata in Australian
trade-union circles. Not that there is a
lack of earth in his make-up. There’s
lots of it to go with the astute brain
and the acquired learning to make a
powerful compound.
The earth shows through in his
prickly reactions to opposing opinions,
in his undisguised aversions to the
establishment (a fair target for him
at all times) and capitalists generally,
the Melbourne “Herald” lot in par-
ticular. He has put his money on the so-
called “working classes” and, if these
don’t always understand him, they
listen and even venerate. So in public
he has to play it smart, project the
old-style Labor biases, and trust this is
the right formula in the affluent society.
But is it the right formula? It could
be a question whether Australia is yet
ready for Hawke or it could be that
his old-world class consciousness is out
of date; that he has missed the bus as
it were. As another well-known Western
Australian of his vintage has found
in the Eastern States, it could also be a
question of whether intellectual aggres-
sion really pays off in them.
If Mr. Hawke is sure of his own
philosophies, speaking in public he
seems less so in dilating on Labor’s
political-economic intentions. Take
price control, for instance. From what
he said on TV, Mr. Hawke wasn’t at
all sure that, although it is official
Labor policy, price control v/ould be
implemented by a Labor Government.
He spoke of it being put on some
essentials, but when asked whether he
thought it worked in South Australia
he was rather evasive and inclined to
the negative. This seems at very strange
odds with the practically unanimous
vote in favor of price control at the
ACTU’s seminar on the subject about
ten months ago. On that occasion the
idea of holding a referendum to get
the necessary powers was strongly sup-
ported in default of the accession
of Labor Governments to power Aus-
tralia-wide, when suitable alternative
arrangements to get price control could
presumably be made. On this vital
question it now looks as if Labor is
very much up in the air, at least on
Hawke’s showing.
Against that, there was no question
of Hawke being up in the air on
taxation in his meet with the Press.
There would be a capital gains tax.
That was that. When quizzed on the
point that this was a most costly tax
to collect and in some countries the
expenses had proved higher than the
returns from it, he replied that most
Western countries had one so we should
try it also. His immediate concern was
to get more money to pay higher pen-
sions and social services. Few, except,
perhaps, a majority of Federal Mini-
sters, would deny the worthiness of that
object. Also there would be quite a few
people in this country who would like
to see a capital gains tax as a sort of
“soak the rich and the speculators”
measure. However, as Hawke seems to
see it and he is not alone in his
view there is no inconsistency in
making capital available for income
purposes via this route. This, of course,
is a cardinal eonomic sin and cannot
be condoned, especially when income
redistribution tax processes are to hand.
One would have expected Hawke to
have been more convincing in talking
about his particular field, wages. But
after attacking the Arbitration Com-
mission rather bitterly for, as he said,
breaking its promise not to imple-
ment the total wage until the work
values cases were completed, he went
on to give a very much tongue-in-
cheek explanation of why he objected
to the total wage itself. He said it was
simply because the basic wage con-
cept meant so much, in that it guaran-
teed a minimum. But surely the new
minimum wage associated with the
total wage is better because it is higher
than the basic wage would now be.
Anyway, the real reason why Mr.
Hawke is against the total wage is well
known; it rules out leapfrogging. Al-
though he’s not likely to, it would
be much better if he admitted it,
stopped beating about the bush, pinned
his faith on the work value arena for
the establishment of just margins, and
stored up his energies for the next
economic case at the Commission.
With the next of those cases a year
away, almost, Mr. Hawke is far from
just kicking his heels. He was down at
the CEDA seminar on wages the other
day when J. E. Isaac’s work “Wages
and Productivity” (reviewed in The
Bulletin, July 15) was put under the
microscope. Apart from making a
wholly supportable broad attack on
Isaac’s discussion on incomes policy
(which I’ll look at in a moment), he
gave some interesting personal views
on issues raised in the book. Among
other things he said he was not in
favor of abolishing cross-examination of
witnesses and experts at the Commis-
sion’s hearings and quoted Sir Robert
Menzies as having said in 1947, when
there was a Labor Government (“so
you can see I am going well back into
history,” Hawke said), that “evidence
that has not been cross-examined is
not worth much.” In fact, he was
against most of Isaac’s proposed innova-
tions in what he termed the mechanics
of the Arbitration Commission and also
against putting economists on the Bench.
His broad swipe at the book was on
the grounds that its espousal of an
incomes policy to be worked under the
colors of the Arbitration Commission
would put wage-earners in the position
of being the only members of the com-
munity whose rewards would be con-
trolled and “leave free all other sectors
of the economy who derive their in-
comes in other fashion.” He said such
a policy, in the opinion of the trade-
union movement, would entail a “very
distinct risk of aggravating what we
regard to be in existence already, a
gradual move away from wages.” How
oil earth he interpreted this to be Isaac’s
thesis I don’t know, unless it was to
give an airing to an opinion expressed
in 1959 by the Committee of Consti-
tutional Reform, that the Federal
Government doesn’t have the necessary
weapons (such as capital issues control,
consumer credit controls, and so on)
with which to implement an effective
economic policy. He had simply turned
the book’s main idea upside down.

Roll forged twist drills cost no more, yet are so superior in performance,
that the cost savings they make possible in your production programme
can mean all the difference between your obtaining full profit margins or
just getting-by! Is this a problem you’re facing? You’ll find that twist
drills made by the roll forging process have superior, heavy-cutting
ability, provide increased drilling rates well in excess of B.S. requirements,
and possess a hard, burnished surface-finish that ensures longer life and
fewer re-sharpens. Up to twice as many holes per drill! All this because
as the result of the roll forging drill-manufacturing process, the granular
structure of the high speed steel used, follows the contour of the cutting
edge. No interrupted end-to-end grain where flutes have been milled or
ground out. Roll forged strength throughout! For better drilling
specify P&N Roll Forged Twist Drills, Silver Jet or Black Jet surface
finish: range 1/16th to 1/2-inch. That’s the way to make more
dollars by direct savings in cost!

Merry hell looms
from the
computers
AS 1984 APPROACHES, the appear-
ance of an ever-increasing number of
"buttons for pushing” is a constant
reminder that George Orwell's con-
cept of an age saturated with com-
puters and organisation may not be
too far fetched after all. Already there
are lights which tell us when to walk
and when not to, recordings to tell us
the time and weather conditions, doors
that are self-opening and now, in the
U.S.A., they have even got computers
to tell them which stocks to buy and
sell and when. Very versatile com-
puters they are, too. They can pump
out reams of decision-enlightening
information.
The only things these machines can’t
do is look into the future or apply
intuition to a situation. Thus the lot
of the security analyst is not an un-
happy one. Much of his hack work
is being done for him, yet he is not
in danger of being replaced by a
machine; only he can make the neces-
sary calculated guesses about a com-
pany’s future and understand the
emotions of the market. He also has
the added advantage of having a lot
more information, on a lot more com-
panies, at a much faster speed than
has been possible in the past. The only
problem I can see is that all the com-
puters could come up with the same
advice at the same time and cause
merry hell as everyone moves in to
take the same market position.
I should probably mention that this
week’s selections are based only on
old-fashioned non-electric-type slide-
rule calculations and other such antique
methods. They are, however, tempered
with native intuition (if that’s worth
anything) and human views on future
prospects. The companies I have
chosen are Thiess and Consolidated
Rutile.
Thiess, w hich is now r selling for $2.18,
could, in my opinion, reach $3.00 by
Christmas. The company’s ill-fated
Snowy Mountain project is now in
the past. In the present and future is
a contracting division which is trad-
ing profitably and holding contracts for
$5B million, a profitable and expand-
ing Toyota division, and an extremely
lucrative coal division. It is the coal
which holds the main clue to Thiess'
future fortunes. More precisely, the
company’s 22 percent interest in Thiess
Peabody Mitsui Coal Pty. Ltd., of
Queensland. This consortium already
has contracts to supply Japan with 40
million tons of coal, and more orders
from both overseas and local sources
look assured. Current annual capacity
is 2.5 million tons; by early 1968 this
will be 4.5 million tons. Apart from
the dividends Thiess receives from its
equity holding, it also receives
royalties from the project. These fees
will be up to $780,000 a year when
the capacity increase begins to oper-
ate. And, for a final bit of cream, Thiess
has also staked claims near Kalgoorlie
to look for nickel, copper, gold, and
tin.
Consolidated Rutile is another stock
which looks as though its price could
improve quite considerably by the end
of the year. The company mines beach
sands at Stradbroke Island and has just
announced a 1966-67 profit of $112,000.
This result was panned by one news-
paper as disappointing and lauded by
another as being a good effort in view
of the teething problems and losses en-
countered by the company in the first
half of the year. I agree with the latter
line of thinking and, on the basis that
the company’s problems are now behind
it, bought 200. If the shares recover to
their early 1967 price of $1.61 'there
will be a healthy profit of almost 40
percent to be made on the deal.
On the subject of profits, a few weeks
ago I mentioned that William Adams'
directors had predicted that thews
would be exceedingly healthy. What
they in fact said was that their sales
would be ahead, whereas the deductions
about their profits was purely my own.
This week the stocks I sold earned
me a net profit of $241. John Martin,
which I had almost given up,
brought in $32 when, with a sudden
burst of enthusiasm, it went up $0.10;
Hecla turned in a profit of $4l when
it was sold on the last day before going
ex-issue; best of all, A. G. Healing
came good with a bonanza of $l6B.

SIR lAN POTTER is an early riser,
no less in his mellowing than in his
youthful years. You have to be to catch
American bankers, not only at the
smart work put over the local fringe
financiers by the First National City
Bank of New York in combination
with Waltons last week, but in getting
the right price for your share in a plot
of what Mr. McEwen would call “the
local farm.” What price Sir lan got
for the 443,000 ordinary shares held by
him and associated Potter interests from
the Morgan (U.S.) people we may
never know, but it can hardly have been
much less than $2 million. So rather
ingloriously from the national view-
point, because the deal dilutes Aus-
tralian influence and stiffens overseas
influence on private finance, AUC be-
comes virtually an overseas merchant
bankers province and Sir lan retires
finally to the sidelines.
In terms of shares of the AUC itself,
it would appear that Morgan’s (count-
ing other New York parcels) now have
about 20 percent of the company,
including preference holdings; two
U.K. merchant bankers have a shade
more than this, with Morgan Grenfell
(which is linked with the Morgan mob
in New York) 11 percent, and Lazard
Bros., of Old Broad Street, about 10
percent. Lazard Frere and Co. also got
a stake on the merger with Anglo-
Australian Corporation in 1963 which,
together with that going to the above
partners in Anglo-Australian at that
time, brought their combined interest
U P to 35 percent of the company. The
sale of the Potter shares now puts them
solidly in the majority with Morgan
Guarantee International Finance Cor-
poration, one of whose executive vice-
presidents is now joining the board,
So does Mr. T. J. Foley, chairman of
British Tobacco, probably representing
the Bank of New South Wales, which
has also bought 75,000 shares,
With these stratospheric shifts corn-
pleted, the painful exit of Sir lan,
painful that is, to the many who
his d ture from a world he
ma de his looks dreadfully final
In the meantime life for the invest-
ment minnows goes on. And it does a
bit more merrily than last week, when
prices were overcast by one of those
accustomed eclipses that occasionally
occur in a bull market. It looked as if
the correction, which lasted about a
fortnight, was over, the way clear for
a further advance. But one or two
damp squibs were being thrown by the
likes of Mr. Ken McMahon (no rela-
tion to Bill) to put a damper on the
idea that the sky has again become
the limit for mining shares. Talking
as chairman of Mineral Securities Aus-
tralia at the annual meeting in Sydney,
he said “the new public awareness of
mining and the minerals industry is
a good thing to see but it is hoped
that the investing public does not get
carried away to the stage where share
prices become abnormally high and
investors are hurt.”
THOSE WHO WENT home happy
with the very nice news from Elder
Smith Goldsbrough Mort last week
when a 13 percent lift in profit and a
rise from 10 percent in the payout
were announced should spare a thought
for the wool-buying brokers who had
it really rough last year. Unlike the
wool-selling brokers such as Elders,
who simply sell for clients and don’t
have to finance stocks on their own
account, the wool-buying brokers buy
wool and carry it for considerable
periods on their own account. There
are three S.E. listed buying brokers,
Wm. Haughton (by far the biggest,
with extensive overseas operations),
Wilcox Mofflin, and H. B. Smith; of
all these which had a particularly
rough trot last year, Wm. Haughton
came out far the hardest hit because
of its huge trade in crossbred types;
these prices slumped heavily from July,
1966, and haven’t shown any great im-
provement yet.
Speaking to the company last week
The Bulletin got the impression from
Wm. Haughton that the tide had
turned, that the exercise of having to
hold such big stocks as it was caught
with early last year is not being re-
peated this one, that the company has
tightened up its costs in all directions
and though crossbred-type wools are
still pretty low (the N.Z. Wool Com-
mission is still having to support the
market at the reduced rever price),
the strain on the company’s finance has
been lightened. The shares are worth
a good look at around their current
price. Buyers were offering 40 cents
last Friday with sellers at 56. The
shares have been sold up to 75 cents
this year.
“HOWEVER MUCH we recover from
the claims . . . without extraordinary
relief we will ultimately lose a very
substantial sum,” Mr. J. W. Blaiklock

North West Cape radio base, which is

subsequently declined to a low of $1.78 in 1965, but the recent break of the
downtrend and the rise in price to $2.45 on high volume indicates that a move
to approximately $2.60 is likely, where some reaction could be expected. The
base consolidation suggests that a longer-term target of close to $3.40 is likely.
Last sale price on 5/9/67 $2.38.

costly as it is proving, is to see that
we endeavor to recover moneys by just
claims and fair treatment where excess
costs have arisen due to changed cir-
cumstances which were never envis-
aged by either party at the time of
tendering,” he continued.
The projected maximum loss figure
of s6m., mentioned in 1966 accounts,
was arrived at after allowing for a
minimum claim recovery (of unspeci-
fied proportion), so for investors to
interpret with optimism the success of
three claims (with a fourth to be
decided) is unrealistic. Not a cent will
be paid by the U.S. Navy until their
audit is completed. Meantime ssm. of
Monier’s funds are tied up in the Cape
project, restricting normal expansion.
The 1967 profits from normal busi-
ness activities will be around last year’s
level of sl.sm. (8.6 percent on capital).
Mr. Blaiklock also knocked on the
head all talk of capital return for the
time being. His sober analysis of the
situation sent the shares reeling from
48c to 39c overnight. There are so
many imponderables in Monier’s North
West Cape position, including the
finances of its defaulting American
partner, Paul Hardeman, that the only
certain beneficiaries are the lawyers.
THE RECOVERY of International
Footwear was well anticipated by the
market and before publication of the
$221,000 profit (after two years’
losses) the shares had put on 15c to
48c in a month. There has been some
relapse since the preliminary report,
when no dividend was declared,
although it would have been asking
too much to expect one. Investors have
been given the assurance that if profit
is equally good this year (it gave earn-
ing rate of 18.2 percent), a dividend
would be paid.
The managing director was careful
to make clear that the company is in
the fashion field, making predictions
difficult, and this the market should
recognise.
The basic wage increases of recent
years have been largely offset by the
developments in shoe machinery, des-
cribed as “miraculous.”
International Footwear sold nine to
10 million pairs of shoes ($10.3m.
worth), of which around 6 percent
were imports. It is not unduly con-
cerned about Australian imports of
cheap footwear from Asia.
Taxation provided in 1967 was only
about 24c in the $. Fairly substantial
tax losses in one subsidiary will be
fully utilised in the current year.
The last dividend paid was 12-|- per-
cent in 1964. After the chastening ex-
perience of a three-year absence from
the dividend lists, a more modest rate
for 1968 would be prudent. Tangible
asset backing is now more than par,
about 10c up on 1966’s 43c, but the
shares may not warrant par value on
the market for another 12 months.


Behind, the balance sheets
Bigger, brighter benefits from
Amalgamated Holdings?
RIGHT NOW Amalgamated Holdings
Ltd. is bouncing along near its highest
price for the past few years; every year
it seems to get up around this $1.40
before the market’s confidence wanes
once again about the good things that
are hopefully anticipated. Will this
time be any different? There is a
chance that it may. There seems every
prospect that the Amalgamated Hold-
ings picture could be a lot bigger and
brighter this time next year.
For now that the threat of tele-
vision is finally past and the picture-
theatre business has settled down to
the normal pattern of depending on
the supply of good films for profits,
directors could well be feeling suf-
ficiently confident about the future to
make some sort of gesture to share-
holders. This is particularly so as its
diversifications, like Rank Xerox,
should soon be contributing hand-
somely to profits. At the recent annual
meeting, the chairman of Amalgamated
Holdings agreed with a shareholder
that the board would at least look into
the question of a bonus.
And it is clear that the accounts of
the Greater Union group (in which
all but a fraction of Amalgamated’s
funds are invested) show that there
are plenty of resources from which a
big bonus one-for-one, for example
could be paid by Amalgamated if it
simply revalued its investments in
Greater Union to something like their
real value.
But really this is one of those com-
panies that is probably good buying
only because it seems to be good buy-
ing; the few surface indications of its
wealth that are available suggest that
the group is very wealthy indeed. Just
how wealthy is something that only
Sir Norman Rydge and his boards at
Amalgamated and Greater Union
would know. For the accounts they pre-
sent to Amalgamated’s shareholders
are among the worst ' (in Australian
Institute of Management terms) of
publicly listed companies in Australia.
Yet if the accounts obscure the
group’s position it is only on the side
of conservatism; the board is far too
honorable for anything else (in fact,
with one knight and three honorables
it is probably one of the most
“honorable” boards in Sydney).
Nevertheless, it is irritating that in-
vesting in Amalgamated Holdings Ltd.
is a bit like the old Saturday night at
the movies when you used to go along
because you didn’t want to miss out,
even though the programs were usually
pretty awful. You always hoped that
one Saturday night you would get your
reward.
Apart from a modest dividend rise
a couple of years ago, shareholders in
Amalgamated Holdings are still wait-
ing for their reward. And the stuff be-
ing annually served up to them in the
meantime that passes for information
about their investment is making the
waiting all the more difficult. For
although their assets are almost ex-
clusively employed in the Greater
Union group of companies, the docu-
ment that is provided to them as repre-
senting that group’s financial position
is far below the minimum that the
Companies Act demands of a listed
public company.
There is no Greater Union, profit
and loss account whatsoever; there is
no list of subsidiaries to which the
accounts refer; there is no explanation
of exactly the extent to which “pup”
companies of the group are consoli-
dated (for some quaint reason it

appears that some companies which are
jointly owned by Amalgamated Hold-
ings and Rank of Britain are “consoli-
dated” into the Greater Union group
accounts even though theoretically they
are in a different structure).
To make things even worse, the
Greater Union accounts that are served
up as a guide to Amalgamated share-
holders are not based on audited
figures, but, as the group auditor care-
fully explains in his report, are com-
piled from the balance sheets of group
companies as at December 31, which
have been prepared by the companies’
officers. The auditor, Peat Marwick
Mitchell & Co., says that these group
accounts have been “correctly drawn
up,” but for what it is worth, he does
not add the usual phrase that they give
a “true and fair view” of the state of
the company. The Greater Union
group companies all balance at June
30, the same date as Amalgamated
Holdings, yet the audited accounts of
these companies are not sent to share-
holders in Amalgamated Holdings.
And, to cap it all, Amalgamated
Holdings’ accounts give no indication
at all about the proportion of profits
that come from film distribution and
screening operations and from other
activities beyond saying that the
highly profitable Rank Xerox oper-
ation has not yet contributed any divi-
dend whatsoever. Nevertheless, the
hints of riches are there and share-
holders can hope that the troubles be-
setting the British Rank group may
continue for long enough to encourage
Rank to show its hand in Australia,
declare a dividend that was more
closely related to its earnings here,
and so bring increased returns to its
Australian partner. ThereYlittle doubt
that it all depends on the Rank organ-
isation; on an earlier occasion Sir Nor-
man Rydge said “we also have to take
into account our other partner in
Greater Union when discussing our
accounting procedure.”
If Rank did decide on generosity,
Amalgamated Holdings could easily re-
value its major asset, its investment
in GU. In existing accounts, share-
holders’ funds (excluding minority
shareholders’ interest) are more than
five times paid capital of GU. Because
of the inbreeding in the GU group,
and the complications of preference
shareholdings, a direct correlation can-
not be determined, but Amalgamated’s
shareholdings in GU, including the
Union Theatre preference shares, is
valued in Amalgamated’s accounts at
only $2.4m. As this includes slm of
preference shares in GUO, the remain-
ing sl.4m could be multiplied three
times to approximate GU’s reckoning.
But the big question is one of earn-
ings; and there is no clearcut evidence
of what sort of cash is really coming
into this group each year. Since the
profit shrinkage of the late ’sos and
early ’6os, GUO has made a profit
comeback in the past three years. Latest
reported result of $791,000 (up 8.4
percent on 1965) is within reach of the
$850,000 earned in 1956 and $864,000
in 1955 before making hefty provisions
for TV contingencies. The GU group,
being private, does not divulge depre-
ciation figures, but as tax provided is
consistently high in relation to declared
profits (showing 47-50 percent on
average, compared with standard tax
rates of 42| percent) the inference is
that generous depreciation rates are
provided, leaving net profit figures
erring, if anything, on the side of
understatement.
Prior to television’s direct onslaught
on cinema business, Greater Union
Organisation provided sl.3m out of
profits for TV contingencies. Since
then GUO has gone through a period
of conversion, expansion, and consoli-
dation, involving the closing down of
suburban theatres not in key locations,

the re-fashioning of city theatres to
accommodate long runs of quality
films, and the investment in non-
theatre activities. But Amalgamated
Holdings management is still cautious
as to the future. Their attitude is that
future prospects depend on the pro-
ducts available from America and else-
where, voicing the uncertainties in the
motion picture industry today, and the
hazards of correctly measuring public
taste. There is no doubt that since TV
entered three out of four Australian
homes, the public is much more dis-
cerning about the films it wants to see.
Gone are the days of the regular book-
ing at the local cinema to see whatever
was showing. During 1966, year
ended December when GUO balances
its books, GUO had at least three films,
“Alfie,” “Born Free,” and “They’re a
Weird Mob,” which were good money-
spinners, whereas the previous year
there was a dearth of good. entertain-
ment on their circuit.
The public company, Amalgamated
Holdings, has one-half of the ordinary
capital of the major companies of the
Greater Union Group, and all the
preference capital of the Greater Union
Organisation Pty. Ltd. The major
operating companies (owned jointly by
Amalgamated with the Rank organis-
ation of England) are the Greater
Union Organisation Pty. Ltd. (the
major theatre-operating and property-
owning unit of the GU group); Rank
Film Distributors of Australia Pty. and
British Empire Films Pty. (film dis-
tribution); Sixteen Millimetre Aus-
tralia Pty. (audio-visual equipment and
studio equipment, photographic and
optical products, and 16mm. and Bmm.
film library); and the National Theatre
Supply Co. of Australasia Pty. ( cinema
equipment). One half of their assets,

porated in the consolidated accounts

■^■ s Amalgamated Holdings is not an
operating company, the GU accounts
must be examined to assess the worth
Amalgamated shares. The GU group
has investments in its 1966 accounts at
$3.2m, which comprise a one-third
interest in Village Drive-In Ltd., (oper-
atin§ 13 theatres and a motel m Vic-
f ona and on , e th u eal : re and two . “L 0 * 1 ®

$BOO,OOO in 1965; investments in the
Consolidated Drive-In group (in which
Hoyts and some outsiders are the other
shareholders); interests in individual
drive-in companies; and a one-quarter
interest in Rank Xerox acquired in
1962-63. Rank Xerox is yet to pay a
dividend, although it has made very
good profit progress in 1965-66, the net
result doubling from $164,000 to
$332,000, after the company had come
to fresh terms with the Tax Commis-
sioner. Xerographic copying equipment
has been depreciated at the rate of 20
percent per annum, but until 1966 the
Tax Commissioner allowed only 10
percent a year; he has since com-
promised to allow 15 percent. The
1966-67 results are not known publicly
yet, but GU anticipates no dividend to
come into their accounts for the year
to December 1967. (As they said, “It
depends on Rank Xerox.”) The Vil-
lage Drive-In improved profit from
$159,000 to $277,000 in the year to
June, 1966, but 1967 results are not yet
determined.
Fixed assets are shown in the latest
GU accounts as $15.4m, subject to pro-
visions of sB.3m for depreciation,
amortisation, repairs, renewals, and
obsolescence (a description which
surely covers every contingency). Of
the $ 10.8 m in freehold land, buildings
and improvements, slo.lm is at cost.
Shareholders frequently point out that
many theatre properties were acquired
in the ’3os, and could therefore be re-
valued for a bonus issue. The con-
servative chairman (Sir Norman
Rydge), who heads the board of both
GUO and American Holdings, has in-
formed shareholders in the past that
some of these, being suburban proper-
ties, may be worth little more than the
land on which they stand. GUO’s
policy is to own nearly all its theatre
properties (leaseholds are only
$400,000). ‘
Nearly three-quarter million dollars
is held in Commonwealth securities,
deposits, and cash, for which GU makes
no apology. It says that these funds
will rapidly disappear with the building
of the new theatre in Brisbane (corner
of Albert and Elizabeth Streets) and
two new drive-ins at Heddon Greta (on
the northern coalfields) and at Browns-
ville, near Wollongong, in N.S.W.
Although the chairman in his review
spoke of saturation point in some areas
for drive-ins and uneconomic patron-
age, Hoyts has just completed a drive-
in at Tamworth, and independents have
established two new drive-ins in
Queensland, and one in Lismore, and
his own company has not stopped in-
vesting in selected areas.
The GU group has always been a
liquid company (in 1962 it had over
$1 million in liquid funds), and Sir
Norman, defending his conservative
accounting practices at last week’s
annual meeting, showed pride in the
fact that the company has no external
indebtedness. (The only secured liabili-
ties are mortgages, $125,000, and over-
draft, $119,000.) Sooner or later some-
thing’s gotta give at GU. When it
does, shareholders in Amalgamated
Holdings should do handsomely out of
it.


Security analysis
Pricing Aust. Newsprint for
the “general public”
IN APRIL, 1959, the two major share-
holders let the public into Australian
Newsprint Mills Holdings Ltd. at $2.85
per $2.00 share. A one-for-ten bonus
issue has since been made, which has
the effect of reducing the net cost of
the shares to $2.60; this latter figure
is precisely the price at which shares
were issued to the two new share-
holders who were allotted million
during the 1965/6 year. If we assume
that the 1,100,000 shares which were
originally placed have remained in the
hands of the “general public” that
is, that the newspaper companies have
not repurchased any at the market
prices which have prevailed between
April, 1959, and today the news-
paper companies own about 71 percent
of the Australian Newsprint, Tasman
Pulp and Paper about 16 percent, and
“others” about 13 percent.
Tasman Pulp and Paper seems to
be the only substantial shareholder who
has paid well for entry, for the cost
per share (ex bonus) to this New
Zealand company was $3.37. The
statistics below show the prices which
the “general public” have been paying
for their shares over the five years to
December 31, 1966:

Over this period, after adjusting for
the one-for-ten bonus issue in April,
1963, the price has ranged between
$4.30 and $2.90. The price ' paid by
Tasman Pulp was just over 6 percent
below the mid-price in this range. The
price paid by News and by Australian
Consolidated Press was 10 percent
below the lowest price and they don’t
have to put up all the money until
1970.
The deal seems to be quite a good
one for the two new shareholders, be-
cause the pre-tax return would be
nearly 13£ percent assuming tax at
42| percent and the maintenance of
the 10 percent dividend rate. Cur-
rently the shares are being traded at
$4.15 and at this price the “general
public” only receives a return of 4.8
percent. The question is, then, what
sort of growth in dividends per share
can be expected or what will occur in
the future that will cause the shares
to rise above their high point of the
1961-1966 period?
One good prospect is that, when the
new shares are fully paid, the com-
pany may distribute the share pre-
mium reserve in the form of a bonus
issue. This was done at the time the
two million shares were allotted to
Tasman Pulp, so there is a fair chance
that it will happen again; it must be
pointed out that only half of the share
premium received was so distributed.
On the same basis, the bonus issue
could only be a one-for-thirty, but if,
after 1970, the company decided to dis-
tribute all the remaining share pre-
mium reserve, then another one-for-
ten bonus issue would be possible.
At the back of the 1966 annual
report there is a reprint from an
article by Mr. L. R. Benjamin, which
appeared in the June, 1966, issue of
“Newsprint Log.” The final sentence in
the reprint reads: “With a shining new
concept of what the industry can be-
come, Boyer is standing on the thresh-
old of an exciting and prosperous
future.” Mr. Benjamin was referring
in his article to technological advances
that were being made in the pulp-
ing process and it seems that these
advances will have important cost sav-
ings. In recent years, the company
must have effected many cost savings,
because the price of its product has
been falling steadily.
It now seems that the new agree-
ments with the major shareholders, the
newspaper companies, provide that a
price will be paid for newsprint that is
above the landed Canadian price. How
much above that price and whether
the Australian newsprint price is a
fixed one or tied to the Canadian
price have not been disclosed; the
phrasing of the statement in the direc-
tors’ report in the 1966 annual report
suggests that the price has been fixed
for ten years “at a price substantially
higher than the current landed cost of
Canadian newsprint.”
From the annual reports of the past
five years, one can calculate the aver-
age price obtained and the average
production cost per ton of newsprint.
There is a problem in stock move-
ments, but it seems that the average
price obtained as quoted by the com-
pany is calculated by dividing the
figure for “newsprint sales” by the
figure for “newsprint production
(tons).”
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Average price 5 164 6 163.4 160.9 160 0 151.0
Average cost $ 110.3 109.8 109.2 114.3 115.9
The expansion program is designed
to lift production to about 165,000 tons
of newsprint per annum and it will be
financed from the new shares allotted
to News and to Australian Consolidated
Press, from $6.5 million of “accumu-
lated liquid resources” and from $15.7
million of borrowings. By speculating
that the new price is 10 percent higher
than the 1966 price, one can make a
very rough estimate of the profits that
will be obtained when the expansion
program is completed as follows:
$ million
Sales (165,000 x 5165) = 27 2

It has been assumed that there will
be no income from Commonwealth
securities, etc., as these will be sold
as part of the funds which are to be
provided from “accumulated liquid
resources.”
It is immediately apparent that the
figure of $3.6 million is only 50 per-
cent greater than the 1965/66 profit
figure of $2.4 million. The reason is
that, on the figures which I have used,
there would be a gross profit of $49
per ton, so the increased production of
72,000 tons will give an additional
gross profit of $3.5 million. The in-
creased depreciation charge of $BOO,OOO
and the interest charge of $l.l million
will only leave an increase in pre-tax
profit of $1.6 million. It is also im-
portant to realise that if the price
should be only $155 per ton of news-
print this increase in pre-tax profit
would disappear entirely, as it will
if production costs per ton rise by more
than 9 percent.
The company has done an excellent
job in controlling production costs and
it seems unlikely that a rise of the
order of 9 percent will occur in the
next five years. The price per ton of
newsprint has been fixed for the next
ten years, but we do not know at what
precise level.
With an assumed net profit of $3.6
million, earnings per share become
about 31 cents. This figure also repre-
sents an increase of about 50 percent
on the 1965/66 figure and it should
be achieved within the next five years.
This means that, at current prices, Aus-
tralian Newsprint Mills Holdings shares
are selling at 13.4 times 1971/2 earn-
ings. If the new newsprint price has
been overestimated, then the prospec-
tive price/earnings ratio will be even
higher. Of course, the company may
be able to increase production above
the figure of 165,000 tons, perhaps to
about 180,000 tons, and this would
have the effect of increasing earnings
and lowering the price/earnings
multiple.
Fixing what is an appropriate price
for the shares when such a small per-
centage of the total capital is available
for trading must be hazardous. The
entreprenurial shareholders have only
paid up to $3.37 and this would seem
to me to be a little on the high side.

Mining
Wapet, and two uraniums
STRANGE, WASN’T IT, that the
market paid so little attention to
Wapet’s prodigious oil flow from its
third well on Pasco Island, which is a
nub of a place about 4J miles south
of Barrow Island, off the W.A. coast.
Ampol Exploration shares, which
admittedly are on the very thin end of
the broad wedge of interests with a
stake in the field, hardly batted an
eyelid in the region of 165-170 cents.
The two holes on the island scarcely
discovered a cracker, but this one’s
1750 barrels a day is the best of Wapet’s
finds so far. It puts all the finds on
Barrow, now an established oilfield, in
the share and comes into the Esso-BHP
range.
Perhaps speculators need a bit more
than one hole to make a new summer
in oil-search shares. But Ampol
Exploration might be a good one to
get hold of just in case the drill con-
firms the latest find when it’s put down
for a fourth dip. In the meantime, the
market has taken the bit of metals
shares again, though not all that
strongly. The drive still seems, to be
coming from London, whose overnight
prices have again been beating our own
market close in a number of mining
shares by a fair margin. Yet let us look
beyond the bigshots this week and take
in a few of the lesser brethren.
UNITED URANIUM NL, whose
shares were down to 45 cents earlier
this year, have been coming under
notice as the uranium horizons loom
a little, if not all that much, closer.
At 50 cents at the beginning of July,
they got up to 96 last week but finished
below the best. The immediate interest
is, of course, the new arrangement
come to with three other companies to
intensify exploration for uranium in
the company’s South Alligator and
Pandanus Creek prospecting and lease
areas. The three partners, who will
earn a 40 percent interest in the areas
on spending $1.2 million by the end
of 1970 (with an option to purchase
8 percent more at a premium at that
time), are Electrolytic Zinc (E. Z.
Industries), Peko-Wallsend Investments,
and a U.S. group, Newmont (which has
a subsidiary here, Newmont Pty. Ltd.).
This is in part consummation of a
joint exploration intention announced
by E.Z. and Peko for northern Aus-
tralia in June this year, when the other
two participants were not mentioned.
This is the second arrangement
United has come to with outsiders to
explore its outlying areas to the east
of its old uranium workings at El
Sharina, which ceased operation in
September, 1964, when its uranium
contracts ran out. But little has been
heard of the successes or otherwise of
this other one, in which another big
U.S. group, Western Nuclear Inc., of
Denver, paid United $150,000 last year
for prospecting rights to earn an 85
percent interest over a 2918 sq. miles
area in the Parsons Range and another
2715 sq. miles in the Mt. Marumba
area. At United’s last annual meeting
the chairman was perhaps too engrossed
with disappointment about the
Government’s ban on uranium exports
in April and also with the regression
at the Moline lead-zinc-silver mine to
mention Western Nuclear, except that
it had paid over its money (even with
that $150,000 taken into account,
United’s loss went up from $104,978 to
$157,371 last year).
Obviously, United Uranium shares
are not worth their present price until
uranium turns up trumps. At least the
board is active in preparing the ground
for that event, a bit more earnestly per-
haps now that the Moline mine, which
started operations early this year, is
now not expected to produce dividends
nor, for that matter, make much of a
contribution to exploration expendi-
ture. Last year the chairman held out
the prospect of the mine earning some
$500,000 a year, but as development
proceeded this prospect vanished. In-
stead of persisting, the lodes, which
earlier had given recoveries of 70 per-
cent for both silver and lead and 80
percent for zinc, became narrow and
erratic.
So, it is very helpful to have all this
exploration money coming in from out-
side. There is also a possibility of the
Japanese coming to the same sort of
party with United, as this was one of
the companies the Japanese mission
here earlier this year called on (others
were MKU and Kathleen Investments).
Apparently the Japanese intend to fol-
low up these first approaches, despite
the intervening ban placed on uranium
exports, which, incidentally, United’s
chairman doesn’t think will stay on all
that long.
Dr. Teiji Kamimyana, director of
the Japan Atomic Fuel Corporation,
whose predilections for nuclear-power
stations are well established, said last
week he was in close contact with the
Atomic Energy Commission here and
is thinking of sending another explora-
tory mission here next year.
WHILE ALL THIS is a sweetener for
United Uranium, another company
with the metal’s name in it but also
not currently producing any of it (nor
likely to in the foreseeable future),
North Australian Uranium Corpora-
tion, got a lift in the market from its
profit rise from $139,846 to $171,359
in the year to June 30 (this excluded a
capital profit of $58,046 from the sale

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN—Any
person knowing the whereabouts of
Kathleen (married name unknown)
daughter of Mrs. Belle Borison, de-
ceased, formerly of Auckland, New
Zealand, is asked to communicate with
the undersigned: ALLEN, ALLEN &
HEMSLEY, P.O. Box 50, SYDNEY
2001.
of Cleveland Tin shares). This com-
pany, which is half-owned by Aber-
foyle Holdings Ltd., is, of course,
strictly a tin and wolfram proposition
now, with its operations concentrated
at Storeys Creek mine in Tasmania. In
the previous year profit was about
halved, mainly because of various write-
offs and increases in operating costs at
Storeys Creek. In that year the grade
of ore dropped from 1.02 to 0.86 per-
cent, but in the latest year the Dorset
dredge treated 1.5 m. cubic yards (1.7 m.
the previous year) for 102 tons of tin
concentrates, compared with 83.6 tons.
So, although the preliminary statement
doesn’t say precisely by how much, the
grade treated during this past year
would have been distinctly higher. Wol-
fram output was down from 326.39 to
311.75 tons, but substantially better
prices for this metal materially assisted
the result.
NAUC passed on all the shares it
got in the float of Cleveland Tin last
year to its shareholders, who will see
from this week’s report on this fledgling
of the five-brothered Aberfoyle tin
family that it’s growing up rapidly to
be a producer and with the minimum
of growing pains, apparently. Another
Tasmanian proposition, up to June 30
about $5.5 million bad been spent
capitalwise on Cleveland and another
$l.l million had been committed. About
$8.6 million had been estimated to
bring it to the production stage; it
seems it won’t need as much. If so, the
company should be able to repay its
extensive borrowing, or some of it,
rather earlier, to compensate generally
for the lower tin prices ruling compared
with original estimates, and leave more
to spare for development and explora-
tion. The report omits to mention any
results from current exploration. These
would be helpful. Operations are now
expected to start early next year and
the commissioning performed before
the end of the current one.
Commodities
Tin prices may soon stabilise
SPOT TIN PRICES on the London
Metal Exchange, at around £stgllBs
a ton, now stand some £stg2oo below
their average for the first six months
of last year. Recent markets have been
fairly well supported by the Interna-
tional Tin Council’s buffer stock, which
remains in a very good position to con-
tinue such support. Indeed it can com-
mand about £stg3o million, which could
even hold prices over a period of two
■or three years.. .
As always with tin, a good deal of
the technical situation depends upon
U.S. stockpile policy. At present the
alternatives are to release less or let
the stockpile selling price go below its
existing level at £1232 a ton.
Some authorities are still able to
see world production and consumption
reasonably in balance this year and
a stable price not too far under £l2OO
a ton. They forecast an actual 1967
output of 167,000 tons and stockpile
releases of 9000 tons a total 176,000
tons. Consumption may move a little
higher than 1966, to 170,000 tons. Net
deliveries to Iron Curtain countries of
5000 tons should bring full demand
to 175,000 tons.
For 1966, mine output reached
163,000 tons and was augmented by
16,000 tons from the American stock-
pile, thus making available 179,000
tons. Western consumption took about
167,000 tons, while 3000 tons moved
behind the Iron Curtain. All this left
a surplus of 9000 tons.
Some earlier hardening of prices
was, of course, a result of the Suez
Canal closing. Expected influences
from the Bolivian mines’ labor dis-
turbances and the Nigerian war did
not affect the market for very long:
Bolivia’s troubles were settled and sup-
plies were maintained from Nigeria,
With production generally going up
and current demand not all that excit-
ing, the buffer stock controller may
decide to allow prices to fall a little
further,
THE CHAIRMAN of Australia’s Milla-
quin Sugar Co., Sir Douglas Forbes,
neatly summed up the sugar situation
in his latest annual report: “The world
price of the commodity is, however,
the weak spot in outlook and I can
see no great hope for higher profits
until a new and effective International
Sugar Agreement is negotiated. We
£ et temporary shortfalls abroad to
bring some surcease in the interim, but
nothing really gainful or of a per-
manent nature.
On top of these desperate circum-
stances comes news that an international
sugar conference will almost certainly
convene in April, 1968—not late this
Y ear as was previously hoped. The
necessity of the conference is widely
admitted.
A fresh production quota system will
naturally be aimed at. Very import-
antly, Cuba is to attend, although per-
haps merely as an observer. That
country precipitated the present crisis
by asking for a 10m. tons quota in
1962.
Supply is still ahead of demand over
the whole world, with every prospect
of this situation getting worse. Optimists
are talking about a “reasonable”
balance by 1970.

If it was previously BHP’s retreat, last week it was ebulliently
BHP’s renewed advance confident on the eve of the Halibut
report; stimulated by London buying, the shares put on a
net 45 cents to a new $12.40 peak. Preliminary results helped
Elder Smith up eight cents to $2.60 and Felt and Textiles
seven cents to 60 cents. The Bank of N.S.W. added 24 cents
to reach SS.SO. Australian Chemical even went up a dramatic
20 cents to $l.BO. Western Mining looked 30 cents brighter

THE LAND
“Pessimism and unrest” for
the wool industry
WOOL’S TRIBULATIONS continue
to scatter a sourish note over the
economic scene. Perhaps last week’s
sales tended to remove a small measure
of apprehension, with their rather firmer
prices for better quality Merinos. Yet,
discordant explanations of this improve-
ment, and of longer-term trends, are
doing little to release a mood of doubt
which has seeped through the industry.
The National Council of Wool Sell-
ing Brokers appears to believe that
“wider competition and stronger
demand has stabilised prices.” Sir Wil-
liam Gunn would seem to be still
puzzled, willing to ascribe all declines
to overseas economic conditions “if
the market continued to fall.” He
doesn’t fortify predictive certainties
much when, speaking of the earlier
price collapse, he adds, “How much of
this was due to actual weak demand
and how much to the cumulative effect
from some initial lack of confidence it
is impossible to know.”
A large buyer, Sir James McGregor,
hazards that the local market will grow
stronger in a few weeks, criticises the
July-August sales timing, and “blames”
the usual overseas economies.
To complicate a rather dubious week
came the news of Du Pont’s 18 percent
reduction in its British-listed prices of
“Orion” acrylic fibre. It is, of course,
well known that Du Pont’s principal
U.K. rivals, Chemstrand, and Court-
aulds, have been particularly indulgent
with discounts and price-cuts. The
latest pricing moves may well be dic-
tated by the lower (crossbred) wool
levels. Their message is plain.
None of this mass of disturbance was
notably dissipated when, also last week,
the Australian Wool Board presented
its report for 1966-67 to the Minister
for Primary Industry, Mr. C. F. Ader-
mann. Chairman Sir William Gunn’s
introductory letter had to admit that
“in Australia, the price decline, allied
with the effect of rising costs of produc-
tion, generated some pessimism and
unrest in sections of the industry.”
The report does not bring any cheer
to those who think leaders of the wool
industry should be sitting down to
thrash out fundamentals. Relative
calm, on the other hand, may be one
way of weathering all these distressing
storms. Yet it can’t be easy for many
woolgrowers to agree that “in a set of
circumstances that reduced the average
price per pound and the value of wool
sold at auction to 47.38 cents (greasy)
and $709.3 million respectively the
lowest returns for some years wool
withstood the price pressure of syn-
thetic fibres quite outstandingly.”
That portion of the report dealing
with the International Wool Secretariat
points tfmt that 1966-67 was a bad year
for the textile and fibre industries in
almost every major consuming country
in the European region. It takes com-
fort that wool (excluding strong cross-
breds) came through these drab condi-
tions. The conclusion doesn’t sound
unduly hopeful, though: “Within the
next year, however, the situation of
the wool textile industries of the world
is unlikely to be relieved to any
dramatic extent. Indications are that
recovery will be slow.”
The Wool Symbol program comes
in for a strong pat on the back, while
“the crossbred situation emphasised the
necessity of the work being carried out
by the I.W.A. economists to define the
end-product outlet for certain types of
wool, despite lack of data.”
WOOLGROWERS could take some
heart from the remarks of well-known
Merino stud man Mr. J. Maple Brown,
who has just returned from a keenly
observant tour through Japan, Britain,
the United States, and South Africa.
Despite the price falls he has come
back feeling that world demand for
fine Merino wool will increase. He
stresses that manufacturers must be
enabled to market the end product
competitively, and also that consistent
demand is there for 64s count and finer,
and between 2\ and 3 inches long.
Coarser wools will almost certainly
be the permanent victims of the syn-
thetics upsurge. At any rate, this view
is confirmed by Burlington Industries
Wool Go., of Virginia, U.S.A., whose
mills, despite synthetics, are increasing
their usage of fine wool.
While the Wool Board tends to give
the impression that containerisation and
unit loading can bring cost savings,
Mr. Maple Brown sounds somewhat
sceptical. High-density dumping and
container methods may bring higher
costs at both ends of the wool pipe-
line, he suggests.
Mr. Maple Brown’s most revolu-
tionary ideas are centred on the breed-
ing of a dual-purpose (wool and meat)
Merino. They will provide the subject
of a further comment.

Simplicity of programming and multi-programming
was one of many factors considered by the
Queensland Main Roads Department in selecting,
after careful evaluation, an I.C.T. 1905 computer. It
is being used for motor vehicle registration; traffic
and transportation studies; bridge and road design;
terrain model design and studies; plant usage
and accounting. Like many other users in govern-
ment and industry, the M.R.D., quite simply, was
looking for the computer which offered the
highest productivity in relation to its price.
Fast Delivery: Deliveries of I.C.T. start within a
year for most configurations.
Simplicity in Operation: Communication with
I.C.T. Series 1900 is simple. A typewriter is used
to pass instructions to the computer system in
plain language and an Executive Master Program
takes over.
Direct Access: Information can be obtained
within a fraction of a second by the use of mag-
netic discs in the 1900 range. This means instant
answers to all questions.

Farm products and
the China trade
CHINA’S POLICY, perforce, is to
trade with the West. She cannot “leap
forward” otherwise. The Eastern Bloc
countries either cannot, or will not,
supply her greatest needs. These are
grain, textile fibres, rubber, chemicals,
metals, and machinery. At the same
time, at this stage of her development,
she must export farm products if she
is to achieve her ambition, which is
to transform a backward agrarian
economy into a modern industrial
State, topped with a powerful military
machine. Her export potential lies
largely in rice, soybeans, tea, vegetable-
oil seeds, tung oil, tobacco, silk, small
animal products (eggs, fur, bristles,
skins), textile manufactures, and cer-
tain non-ferrous metals and coal. Her
predicament has already provided out-
lets for some of our surpluses and
holds further possibilities for us.
Take cotton, for instance. If our
cotton industry continues to expand at
its present rate, we will begin to accum-
ulate large quantities of raw cotton
after 1970. Since 1960, textile exports
have been China’s main standby, despite
reduced domestic cotton production.
Severe textile rationing and increased
imports of raw cotton have made this
possible. It seems; unlikely that the coun-
try will be able to get off this treadmill
in the foreseeable future. In the present
political chaos it is said that some
cadres and communes are cashing in
on the cotton shortage by switching
from food production. However, this
trend, if indeed it exists on any con-
siderable scale, cannot continue in-
definitely. China has less than 8 per-
cent of the world’s tillable land, yet
must try to feed one quarter of the
world’s people. Already with less than
half an acre of arable land per person
and with her population still expand-
ing, food production must ultimately
be given priority.
Production of vegetable-oil seeds has
also been slipping in recent years.
Meanwhile, our safflower crop has been
expanding spectacularly. Cotton-seed
oil has, of course, been swelling fast
and our peanut crop has increased way
beyond the requirement for edible
nuts, so that substantial quantities are
now being crushed for their oil. Im-
ports of both industrial and edible
vegetable oils have bottomed and we
are already sounding out overseas
markets. China has not been able to
keep up her customary sales of soy-
bean oil to Japan and elsewhere.
China’s losses in the vegetable-oil fields
could become our gains, although we
will meet strong competition from the
U.S.A., which has a well-established oil-
crop industry geared to export markets.
We have been making small but per-
haps significant sales of the coarse

grains, oats and barley, to China for
some time. These could grow to valu-
able proportions. China has been pur-
suing a program aimed at increasing
livestock production and has achieved
some considerable measure of success.
(The only other notable agricultural
success story that the country can claim
since the fiasco years at the end of the
last decade is with sugarcane.) As part
of the policy to obtain hard foreign
currency, China has managed to com-
pete with West European farmers for
markets in eggs, poultry, and certain
processed meats, mainly derived from
the pig. If this program is maintained,
we might find China asking for more
animal-feed grains. Australian plans to
get into grain sorghum production in a
big way could become reality if China
decided to buy from us rather than
from her new-found friends in Africa.
Much of the huge volumes of wheat
imported from us has been used for
animal production. Also in line with
the foreign money-making policy, the
regime intended that the wheat pur-
chases be used to facilitate larger ex-
ports of higher-valued rice. This sound
economic scheme was partly imple-
mented, and it would be interesting to
know why it has not been operated
more fully. Since China is a kind of
middleman in this set-up, one would
expect her to want our entire wheat
crop and not be satisfied with just the
one-third share that she has been taking.
The fact is that China’s rice exports
in 1965 only reached about half the
1959 figure and at best would not have
offset more than a third of the cost of
the wheat imported that year.
But we could find China competing
with us for some markets; for example,
in fresh and canned fruits. American
observers have noted with smug satis-
faction that any increases in agricul-
tural exports from China have been of
the products that are ordinarily raised
on the private plots within the com-
munes. Thus sales of eggs, poultry,
vegetables, and fruit have risen. Canada
is a big buyer of our fruit and a major
seller of wheat to China. The two
might some day strike a bargain that
would leave us out in the cold.
Much depends on the outcome of
the present political unrest in China.
If the peasants gain greater independ-
ence, as they have in Russia in recent
years, the pattern of China’s imports
and exports could alter considerably.
But behind all the slogans, banner-
waving, and rampaging, the realities
of the country’s agricultural economy
stand like stone.
It must have come as a terrible shock
to the Chinese to find in 1961 that
for the first time in their long history
they had become net importers of agri-
cultural products. They have been
working hard since to throw off the
effects of the Great (Foolish) Leap
Forward program which was launched
in 1959 and abandoned two years later.


In the land that invented business flying
the British have sold
20% of the new generation business jets.
Americans and Canadians have so far bought
more than 70 Hawker Siddeiey business jets. On
average, world membership of this exclusive club
grows at the rate of one a week.
The Americans have a vigorous home industry for
executive jets. But they are finding that the British
125 is exactly the right recipe for business flying.
It seats up to 8 passengers and has the most
headroom of any of the twin jets. It has a range
of 1,500 miles and speed up to 500 mph. And
with the new, more powerful Bristol Siddeley 522
turbojets it has an even better payload and hot and
high performance. What’s more the 125 is built by
the Company with the world's longest experience of
building civil jets.
Big enough. Fast enough. Cheap enough. This
simple formula is giving the HS 125 its phenomenal
sales growth in the world's toughest and most
discriminating market.

BOOKS
South America: a preposterous
continent poised for change
By PETER COLEMAN
Inside South America. John Gunther.
Hamish Hamilton. $6.60.
DESPITE EVERYTHING, I always
like Gunther’s “Inside” books. He never
underestimates my ignorance of the
places he writes about and you always
know he has worked hard to get the
facts for you. Indeed, he is conscientious
to the point where painstaking must
be a literally true description. Not for
him the pleasure of staying longer in
a country than he- had planned to
simply because he is enjoying it; the
first thing he does on arriving any-
where is to find out how and when to
get out and he sticks to his timetable.
He approaches every country with a
minimum of preconceptions (I remem-
ber a sentence in his autobiography to
the effect that before going anywhere
“a bit of reading can be profitable”
but clearly not too much) and with a
massive program of interviews. In
these interviews for this latest book
he did 722 of them he never does
anything so easy as use a tape-recorder
or take notes immediately the talk: he
makes his notes immediately after each
interview; and, if in that way risks
forgetting the early part of an inter-
view, that shouldn’t matter too much,
since the last two or three minutes of
an interview are usually the best, at
least with many political figures, who
spend the time dodging and clouding
the issues until they see you are leav-
ing, when they may relent a little and
talk more frankly. All interviews
finished and sorted, Gunther then re-
searches through his tremendous lib-
rary of clippings dating back 40 years.
(He prefers clippings to books; they
keep the newsiness in his style, and
Gunther is, above all, interested in
news and facts, not Truth.) Then he
settles down to write three drafts of
every chapter, and by a lavish use of
semicolons packs all his facts together:
indeed, Gunther is the great Semi-
colon Man of our time. >
South America was a special chal-
lenge to him. Americans, James Reston
has said, will do anything for Latin
America except read about it. Even
Edmund Wilson makes a point of
never reading Hispanic literature, let
alone visiting the place. For most
Americans, and probably most Aus-
tralians, it is enough that South
America means a gigolo aristocracy,
illiterate and cruel generals picking
their teeth while dozing on mangy
horses, voodoo, gauchos, head-shrinkers,
cha-cha-cha, and a revolution every
Saturday night —a sort of bad D. H.
Lawrence movie starring Carmen Mir-
anda. But, in any case, Gunther has
done the trip once before —26 years ago
when he published “Inside Latin
America,” a bigger field than covered
in “Inside South America.”
This is, however, an entirely new look
about new issues. (There is naturally
a little overlapping: he still has to say
Brazil is big.) In 1941 the issue was
the threat of Nazi invasion and Ger-
man-backed Fascist revolutions; now
President Frei ... liberal Catholic
Communism, Russia, and China are the
threats. In 1941, South, America was
immobile and General Smedly D. But-
ler had said, “I helped make Mexico
safe for American oil interests in 1914.
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a
decent place for the National City
Bank boys to collect revenues in. I
helped purify Nicaragua for the inter-
national banking house of Brown
Brothers. I helped make Honduras
right for American fruit companies.
Looking back, I might have given A 1
Capone a few hints”; now the con-
tinent is in flux and it is the period
of the Alianza, the Alliance for Pro-
gress.
It is still a preposterous continent.
Two percent of the people own 70
percent of the wealth, and the rich
still ship hundreds of millions of dol-
lars annually to banks in Switzerland
and New York. It has 170 million
people now and will have 700 million
in 30 years; of these 170 million, 40
million need housing, 85 million are
illiterate, and the average life expect-
ancy of all is 40 years. The drinking
water in most capital cities is unsafe.
Smallpox is entrenched in Brazil, Peru,
and Colombia. Twenty percent of all
Brazilian children die in their first
year, and in Bolivia, where 70 percent
of the population are Indians, 75 per-
cent of the Indians die before they are
two. Ten percent of Bolivians, that
is 340,000 people, are fed daily by
U.S. handouts, and U.S. aid is 30 per-
cent of the national budget. The
Revolution of Rising Expectations has
reached the people, but they are still
Lost Expectations, the oligarchs are
still the most powerful force, and land
reform is still only a scrap of paper.
The countries of South America will
in fact, with India, be the test case for
John Gunther ... optimism
those, now on the defensive, who claim
that modernisation is still possible with-
out destroying a country’s traditions,
who deny that a ruthless communist
dictatorship with all its horrors is the
only way of waging a Holy War
against reaction and squalor. Gunther
himself, after his examination of the
ten countries, is not pessimistic. It is
no longer possible, he says, to describe
the power situation in terms of feudal
landowners, commercial oligarchs, cor-
rupt caudillos, and a reactionary Church.
On the plus side, he says the day of the
caudillos Peron, Vargas, Perez, Jim-
enez, Trujillo is gone. Only Para-
guay, Argentina, and perhaps Brazil


and Bolivia are dictatorships today, the
rest are working democracies. (Ecuador
is a toss-up.) The Armies are now con-
scripted (not private gangs) and are
controlled by educated, middle-class,
and often radical officers who espouse
a sort of Creole Nasserism. (The
Navies are still upper-class and con-
servative; the Air Forces are pro-
American. Costa Rica, of course, does
without the lot.) The oligarchs are
beginning to lose power; Peron cut
them back in Argentina for ever, and
neither the liberal Catholic President
Frei of Chile nor President Belaunde
of Peru is a puppet of the oligarchs.
Some of the oligarchs may even have
to start paying taxes at last: when
Gunther was in Chile, the first case
ever recorded in the history of
South America occurred in which a
businessman was jailed for non-pay-
ment of tax; at least it’s a start. The
extreme Right Wing has lost parliamen-
tary power everywhere, the non-Com-
munist Left is respectable, and organ-
ised Labor has risen spectacularly. The
Church (one third of the world’s
Roman Catholics are South Ameri-
cans) is gingerly entering a Liberal
phase. (Anti-clericalism is official only
in Uruguay, which has abolished Christ-
mas Day, renamed Easter Week
Peru’s Belaunde (l.) ... no puppet
Tourist Week, and where the Press
refers to the Pope as Mister Montini.)
Even women are beginning to change:
if at sophisticated dinner parties they
still sit silently like well-taught pets,
the universities are full of girl students,
and in Argentina women are a third of
the total work force.
But if the continent is obviously
poised desperate for change,
Gunther’s evidence for optimism is. not
really reassuring. Whatever encroach-
ments have been made on the ancien
regime, they will not satisfy the popular
rising expectations, and Gunther him-
self admits this when he mentions the
other great factor in the ancien regime,
in fact, its bulwark the terrifying
power of the United States. The Com-
munists have only come close to win-
ning one South American election, in
Chile in 1964, and their power any-
where is confined to students, intel-
lectuals, some unions and guerillas.
But for the immediate future it is
ultimately the United States and its
determination to intervene, not the
power of domestic forces, which give
the Communists little prospect of suc-
cess in South America. Yet even this
miserable hope is uncertain while
Castro, however discredited otherwise
as a Kremlin stooge, remains a symbol
of a weak country that told the Ameri-
cans where to get off and got away
with it, and while any radical pro-
gressive move in South America is
bound to take an anti-American direc-
tion. And if there is one safe predic-
tion to make about this continent it
is that it will have a dozen revolutions
in the coming few years.
The Soviet puzzle
By EUGENE KAMENKA
The Fate of the Revolution. Walter
Laqueur. Weidenfeld and Nicolson.
$6.60.
IF TSARISM WERE overthrown, the
Russian Minister of the Interior Dimi-
try Tolstoy predicted to Prince Bulow
in 1884, then its place would be taken
by Communism “Communism pure
and simple, the Communism of Mr.
Karl Marx, of London, who has just
died and whose theories I have studied
with attention and interest.”
The Communist State in the Soviet
Union is now 50 years old; Karl Marx
has succeeded St. George as the official
patron saint of its rulers and ruled;
the confident Western predictions of
1917 and 1918 that a planned
economy would grind to a halt within
two or three years and that Bolshevik
“anarchists” would be incapable of run-
ning a State —now strike us as ludicrous
at best. No serious thinker would now
doubt that the impact of the Russian
Revolution was as important as that
of the French, that Lenin was at least
as significant a historical figure as
Napoleon, and that Stalin can rank in
the history books of the future beside
Ivan the Terrible, whom he came to
admire so much.
But there most of the agreement
ends. Was the Bolshevik Revolution
the first historic step on the road to
building Marx’s communist society or
was it an unprincipled seizure of
.power by a dictatorial party in a back-
ward country, bound to compromise the
cause of socialism for decades, if not
centuries, to come?
Were the now generally admitted
horrors and idiocies of Stalinism a sur-
face aberration or were they deeply
rooted in Leninism, or even Marx-
ism? Was the forced collectivisation of
1929, with all its suffering, a monstrous
mistake or an absolute necessity for an
under-industrialised country faced by
the possibility of war?
And if Marxism in Russia went
wrong, when did it go wrong? With the
Bolshevik - Menshevik split in 1903,
with the April theses of 1917, with the
suppression of the Left Social Revolu-
tionaries in 1918, with the bloody
butchery of the Kronstadt sailors and
the Tenth Congress of the Party in
1921, or with Stalin’s purges in the
19305?
On all these questions there is among
serious and competent historians still
no agreement. On some of them, per-
haps, there never will be. The archives
of the Soviet State are not available to
any historian who will write honestly.
Those of the French Revolution have
been available for over a century, and
men argue about the French Revolu-
tion as much as they do about the Rus-
sian. The large questions in history have
no simple and self-certifying answers.
Nevertheless, one has only to read
Western writing about Russia in the
19205, and again in the 19405, and
then in the 19605, to realise what very
real progress in the understanding and
rational assessment of Soviet society
has been made in the past 50 years, and
especially in the past 20. If there are
still many, many competing interpre-
tations of Soviet history, they are now
Lenin and Stalin, 1922. .. purges
for the most part rational, in-
telligent interpretations, combining an
understanding of Russia with sociologi-
cal imagination and an appreciation of
the Marxist tradition.
The leading writers in the Sovieto-
logical field and in contemporary-
history today have a great deal on
w T hich to congratulate themselves. One
has only to compare Professor Ulam
with Sir Bernard Pares, or Klaus
Mehnert with the Webbs, to realise
the tremendous strides in sophistication
that have been made in the study of
Bolshevism and the Soviet State.
And as one reads more deeply one
notes with interest that this sophistica-
tion has been brought to the univer-


sities largely from outside, by men
whose first interest was ideological
politics, by Continental emigres and
disillusioned Communists. Until
academics learned to use words like
“ideology,” “police state,” “mass
terror,” “liquidation,” and “front”
without distaste, they simply could not
understand what Bolshevism was about.
Most of them, and most of those
remote from Marxism, really did not.
Sir Bernard Pares and Churchill were
not the only non-Marxists to see Lenin
as a butcher in 1918 and to see Stalin
as a respectable head of State in 1944.
The myth that power confers respect-
ability is one against which only ex-
Marxists seemed professionally immune.
Walter Laqueur, now Visiting Pro-
fessor in the History of Ideas at Bran-
deis University, editor of “Survey”
(the excellent London journal on Soviet
and East European affairs), and of the
new “Journal of Contemporary His-
tory,” is one of those men whom one
would cite as examples of the sophisti-
cation of political history today and
of the contribution made by those who
came late to the groves of academe.
His studies of Communism and Nat-
ionalism in the Middle East, of the
German youth movement, of German-
Russian relations, and his writing on
the Soviet Union have been models of
readability combined with historical
seriousness and intelligence. “The Fate
of the Revolution,” based on a series
of lectures given to students at Bran-
ded, is a slighter work, but at its level
completely satisfying.
Professor Laqueur does not aim to
answer questions about the Russian
Revolution, to develop his own inter-
pretation, but only to present a read-
able guide to the intepretations there
have been and to make, by the way,
some points about the nature of con-
temporary history as a discipline and
about the minds of people who have
studied Russia.
He begins with the remarkable
naivete of supposed Western “experts”
writing on Russia at the outbreak of
the Revolution, in the 1920 s and 19305;
he describes the gradual growth of
Soviet studies; he traces the disputes
about the nature of the 191? Revolu-
tions, about the role and character of
Lenin, about the inevitability and
necessity of Stalin; he casts£,a side-
glance at Soviet historiography. In a
very interesting chapter he discusses
the mind of E. H. Carr, how it makes
him see history and the Soviet Union,
and how it changes as he writes.
No one interested in Russia or Com-
munism will find this book either dull
or unprofitable. He may wish Mr.
Laqueur had written more, that he
were a social theorist as well as a
historian, and that he had been less
deliberately self-effacing. One puts
down the book with a whetted appe-
tite, rather than with a feeling of
repletion. No doubt, that is precisely
what Professor Laqueur intended in the
lectures.
Factual content
By ADAM RICHMOND
Variety of Men. C. P. Snow. Macmil-
lan. $4.60.
THE CRITICISM THAT used to be
made of C. P. Snow was that he was a
snob because he chose to write about
bureaucrats and dons, and was con-
cerned with themes of power. His critics
belonged to the “human relations”
school of novel-writing. Members
of this school seem to believe that the
best of all themes for a novel is a
simple, sensitive study of the sex life of
another novelist. This criticism of Snow
was only one more manifestation of one
of the most remarkable characteristics
of recent British contributions to con-
temporary Eng. Lit.: that some of the
most highly praised novels are those
that have little to do with anything that
matters very much.
Snow was at least concerned with
themes of some importance. What was
Lord Snow... second-rate writer
wrong with him was not his choice of
theme, but the fact that he was not a
first-rate writer. There seemed to be no
basic “style” illuminating his view of
life: he did not have the artist’s capacity
for patterning a world that is distinc-
tively his own. But it seems unfair to
lob this criticism at Snow in particular.
It is a characteristic of much good
second-rate writing that it lacks style.
(Have you ever noticed how many
Penguin novels, for instance, all seem
to be written by the same author?)
Now that Snow has come out with
this book of sketches of nine great men
two physicists, a mathematician, two
writers, and four politicians some of
those who have attacked him have
chosen to praise him. They have, no
doubt, been impressed by the import-
ance of his subject matter. You can’t
very well say it is merely snobbish to
write about Einstein or Stalin.
But it can still be said that Snow
lacks style. Not only because most of
this book is put together as if it were
a series of radio talks, but in the more
important sense that no theory of what
greatness is seems to inform his view of
great men. He mutters now and again
that he is a “Tolstoyan,” but he can-
not even borrow from Tolstoy to give
shape to his narrative. It’s just one
paragraph after the other.
His very simplicity, however, makes,
the book easy to get through if
intellectual sloppiness does not irritate
you. Better no style than a bad one.
And he has dug out, or retold from
personal experience, sufficient bits and
pieces that are likely to be new to the
general reader for the sheer factual con-
tent to make the book worth a bedside
read. The principal critical note about
the book is that he has confirmed that
he’s not much of a writer.
Scoring high
By NANCY KEESING
The Pleasure Bird. Griffith Watkins.
Longmans. $3.15.
THIS WESTERN AUSTRALIAN
novel is good by any standards. The
fact that it is a first novel makes one
feel optimistic for Watkins’ future. It
has several welcome virtues which are
uncommon in this decade of grace. It
is rich in imagery and perception but
is presented without obscurity, inten-
tional or otherwise. It is exhilaratingly
generous with ideas which Watkins
flings into his book through dialogue,
reverie, action nothing stingy or
withholding about this writer. But per-
haps most uncommon of all “The
Pleasure Bird” is a book about young
adults, not crazy mixed-up kids, not
worrying or worried parents and parent
figures, but people in their twenties
who are blessedly grown-up.
This is not to say the characters
have no problems, sorrows, neuroses.
Everything centres on the grief, bit-
terness, anger, and aspiration of Bren-
ton Price, its central character. But
Price, when his neurosis tips him into
irresponsible, even cruel behaviour,
analyses himself and other people like
a man not like a peevish child or
wayward beatnik. He gives and takes
pleasure like a man, punishment like a
man, love like a man, and he seeks
sexual love with women, not with silly
little girls. Uncommon indeed.
Where Watkins scores high also is
in his ability to describe things, people,
action in which the reader may have
no predisposition to be interested, in
a way which both explains and enthralls
at once, and which is always relevant
to his book as a whole.
Instances of his skill are in the two
boxing episodes. No one could be less
interested in, or know less about box-
ing than this reader. I couldn’t skip a
word or a word about the breeding
and raising of rare fish, or, and per-

haps the greatest test of all, a word
about Brenton’s paintings. Usually
novels about painters and their paint-
ings fail to convince and grow tedious,
this does neither.
But the cleverest description of all
is surely of the young woman Karen,
seen through Brenton’s eyes. The prob-
lem here was to show a girl attrac-
tive enough to engage his attention,
intelligent enough to hold his interest
even for an intentionally brief affair,
sufficiently compatible to arouse his
passion (for he is a reasonably fas-
tidious man) but yet not nice enough
to cause regrets.
Price treats Karen badly she re-
taliates with an over-mean revenge that
is entirely in accord with what we know
of her of her eyes, her hands, her
impulsiveness. This entire episode is
subtle, sure, consistent. Indeed these
qualities pervade the book and make it
very satisfying and complete within its
own compass.
Hilarious stew
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Angel and the Cuckoo. Gerald
Kersh. Heinemann. $3.85.
GERALD KERSH’S LATEST novel
must be one of the raciest, most enter-
taining rogues’ galleries of London since
Gay conceived the “Beggar’s Opera” or
Hogarth zestfully followed the “Rake’s
Progress.” It bursts with the same
irrepressible delight at flouting con-
vention but somewhere just seems to
miss out on that vital extra dimension
that might have secured it a similar
place in immortality.
Set in a murky Soho cul-de-sac
(Masham Court on the map but Pud-
den Bag Alley or the Road to Hell to
the locals), and covering roughly the
period of the two World Wars and
the “terrible peace” between, it
sketches a bizarre backwater where
once even the guide-books feared to
tread.
The migrant restaurateur Steve
Zobrany, the eternal predestined
victim, is tricked into buying the
sleazy Angel and the Cuckoo. Mis-
used, abused, betrayed a thousand times
by his vagabond friends, Steve remains
blissfully, idiotically happy to the last
the one innocent cherub in an over-
crowded nightmarish nest of outsized,
man-eating cuckoos.
There is Perp, the gigantic, misshapen
gargoyle turned master-criminal, exud-
ing evil, magnetism, and pickled onions
from every sweaty pore; Maundy Pen-
tecost, the pornographic bookseller and
petty blackmailer; Geza (alias the Baron
de Cseh), confidence trickster de-luxe,
later elevated to fame as the millionaire
Hollywood director Gaby Chess;
Madame Alice, part witch, part abor-
tionist; Steve’s faithless wife, Alma,
the cuckoo-in-residence; the “intellectual
keyhole” Tom Henceforth, failed
would-be-genius and later to become
the second Lord Haw-Haw; and many
more.
With these spicy ingredients, peppered
with the odd obscenity and the
occasional two-language joke, Gerald
Kersh cooks up a hilarious, knock-
about stew and serves it all with
genuine professional wizardry. If the
author one day tames his tremendous
talent long enough to pause occasion-
ally and plumb the depths instead of
having so much fun making waggish
and ribald gestures as he skims over
the surface, there is no knowing what
his prolific pen might still turn out.
Gerald Kersh... genuine wizardry
Books in brief
Attenuated shadow
Shadow on the Sun. Wynwode Reid.
Rigby. $3.50.
WYNWODE REID’S
FIRST novel,
“Doomsday Morning,” was set in a
remote Queensland town, but its themes
and problems were modern and in-
dustrial. With her second book she
moves to the city and to the topical
problems of pharmaceutical research
and business, professional and personal
ethics. A large number of characters
centre on Roger Clisby and his family
after Clisby’s old-established drug
manufacturing business is taken over
by a go-getting firm.
This book is an ambitious and worth-
while attempt. I am therefore sorry to
report that “Shadow on the Sun” is
boring — too long, too predictable, and
often too exaggerated.

Keaton. Rudi Blesh. Seeker and War-
burg. $6.50.
RUDI BLESH indefatigably followed
the late Buster Keaton around for
years, and this is an affectionate record
of the comedian’s career from early
vaudeville efforts through silent slap-
stick and the fantastic high comedy of
features like “The General’’ and “The
Navigator” to the tragic decline into
alcoholism and fits and the final climb
back to fame, culminating in an appear-
ance in “A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum.”
Keaton is as unfunny to some as he
is hilarious to others; the glum white
deadpan mask that greets us from the
Keaton movies does not in itself seem
designed to produce more than melan-
choly, and this is a book more sombre
than funny. But the classic comedy
routines, the image of the little man
threatened by inanimate objects remain
when all the words have been
exhausted.

Beyond Belief. Emlyn Williams. Hamish

THE AUTHOR OF SUCH well-worn
dramatic concoctions as “Night Must
Fall” and the aptly titled “The Corn
is Green” here turns his hand to a
Truman Capote-like study of the Moors
case. Mr. Williams’ feverish involve-
ment in the story is expressed in prose
at once mannered, fussy, sick, and
slack. The tone varies queasily from
the fake-vernacular to the grandly high-
falutin, reaching a climax of fatuity
in the last page, when Mr. Williams
assumes something of the air of a
latter-day John Knox: “But (the mur-
derers’) souls are together, buried in
one grave in moors of their own mak-
ing. And when on Judgment Day these
souls will be dug up, they will stink
to heaven.” “Beyond Belief?” In its
badness, yes.

A Most Private Intrigue. Leo Rosten.

HYMAN KAPLAN’S creator has
turned to a spy thriller. Most of the
action is in Istanbul. There are rich
opportunities for his skill in depicting
funny foreigners (even the sinister
chapters are funny, and the nuances
of dialogue are a delight). However,
I wondered uneasily just how much
readers are intended to laugh, or were
we rather to tingle with frissons of
suspense? If (and the blurb seems to
take Rosten’s thriller seriously) he
meant this as a genuine spine chiller,
I can only say that other writers in
this genre are infinitely more accom-
plished, although the plot is intricate,
exciting, and reasonably surprising.


Period Piece at
the Pink House
SHORT STORY BY LYNDALL HADOW
UNCFE GEORGE, mirabile dictu, was
coming home.
He cabled from London: “Secre-
tary Manton Plains Pastoral Company
Saint Georges Terrace Perth Western
Australia stop Sailing from South-
ampton in Royal Mail Steamer Orontes
leaving port next Wednesday twelfth
February 1958 via Suez arriving Fre-
mantle fifteenth March stop Arrange for
conveyance to Rosa Haus Lincoln
Place Perth for self and Prince Igor
and luggage and advise Mr. Desmond
Manton and Miss Myola Cavan stop
Trust all well in Westralia stop George
Manton reverse charges stop.”
Young Robert, in the Manton office,
read the cable over the telephone to
Great Aunt Myola at the Pink House,
where for years she had busied herself
collecting the Western Australian history
of the Manton family. “Now Uncle
George is coming home at last. My,”
he said, “maybe he’ll do something
about my flying.”
“I doubt it.”
Great Aunt Myola’s voice implied
that she had had experience of Uncle
George in kindred situations. “If you
want to learn to fly, your best approach
is to show him how he’ll benefit. Show
him once you have your licence you’ll
be useful to the Company. He’s been
away so long, he probably doesn’t
know what the other pastoralists
are doing. He’s not hep,” said Great
Aunt Myola with a grin. “Not hep to
it that most of them are using light
aircraft for all kinds of work on their
properties now. And,’’ musing, “when
he went abroad they didn’t even know
the motor-car was taking over from
the horse.”
“Of course. But, My, I want to fly
outside Australia. Big stuff. Not just
whiffling about with dingo baits and
running messages around the stations.”
“There are ways and means for you
to get your ticket, Young Robert, but
Uncle George isn’t one of them.”
“He’s my grandfather. You’d think
he’d do something for me apart from
just a job in the office.”
“I wouldn’t,” said Great Aunt Myola,
“and I’ve known him for over fifty
years.”
She gave the Pink House to the List-
ing Bureau. “For sale, gentleman’s
residence in unusual location near the
city. This is an old colonial home in
its own grounds, and modernised.”
The family descended on her.
George’s brother Desmond, grizzled,
shaky old Desmond, took the oppor-
tunity to get away from Manton Plains
for a week or so; he flew down, MMA,
leaving the station, as he put it, to run
itself with the help of the under-
manager, the foreman, die housekeeper,
cook, yardboy, jackaroos, and native
stockmen, not to forget the Chinese
gardener and the native women (but
he called them the gins, of course).
He flew down, installed himself at the
club, and bombarded Myola with tele-
phone calls from the sanctity of the
chair by the window that even the
newer crop of club men refrained from
using. He had reminded them it was the
Manton chair. George had donated it
before going to the war. “The first
affair, you’ll remember.”
Now to Myola, Desmond said with
the voice of authority acquired in the
later years of George’s absence, “On
no account must you allow the Rosa
Haus out of Manton hands, Myola.
George would never countenance such
a move.”
Then came George’s sons and their
wives, to call on Great Aunt Myola
Cavan. It was a nuisance, having to
come up from the Great Southern and
down from the Midlands. James’ wife,
Annette, even cut short her stay in
Bangkok, where she was observing for
the Save the Children Fund, to get
home to Perth to see what the old
lady was doing about the property.
“There’s an abominable collection of
Victorian junk in the place, not worth
worrying about; but think of the
Georgian Sov’s head facing left, and
the Venetian.”
Her sisters-in-law all pondered as
bidden; they told Myola of their con-
clusions, singly and together. The Pink
House must stay as it was, a home for
Myola and a treasure house of Manton
historical relics. “Until such time,” they
said to each other, “until such time
the old lady passes on,” and each one
to herself, “then we can see who gets
what.” Singly and together the family
descended on Great Aunt Myola at her
home in Fincoln Place. They tele-
phoned her at all hours. They waylaid
her daily. The Pink House remained
with the Listing Bureau.
George Manton and his younger
brothers, Gordon and Desmond, had
taken over Manton Plains from a
negligent father early in the century.
Their grandfather had found the place
simply by following his sheep as they
grazed their way to it over a leisurely
season or two, way back in the ’6os.
This grandfatherly epic shed lustre on
the family name, while the vigor with
which George organised the efforts of
his brothers and of the simple black-
fellers of that part of Western Aus-
tralia kept the firm of Manton Plains
Pastoral Company in a desirable state
of solvency; so much so that the three
brothers were hailed as exceedingly
eligible bachelors by those mothers with
marriageable daughters down in the
capital, who rated desirability in terms
of acres up North and credit balances in
banks down South. The brothers made
the most of this popularity when they
descended on the capital from the vast-
ness of Manton Plains. Especially
George.
George was, in season, always the
first to arrive. Whichever black ship it
was that he met at the Nor’-West port
after his week on the road (a leisurely
drive, four-in-hand through his own
holding, the lesser ' acres and lesser
homesteads of his neighbors), what-
ever ship, Gorgon, Bambra, Centaur,
had the honor of conveying George
Manton, Esquire, of Manton Plains,
to Fremantle, became, from his Nor’-
West port, the gayest ship of the year.
At Fremantle, the voyage completed
in a haze of cigar smoke, champagne,
memories of the dance, of the snatched
kiss, the fervid embrace, the card table,
the ship saw George depart from the
wharfside in the solitary splendor of
a horse cab from the rank, his steamer
trunks and valise following by another.
But through the haze of joviality those
who had run and fetched and carried
and waited at his bidding, the dark men
in their imperturbability and white
coats, pocketing George’s tips that were
so much less than those of the unobtru-
sive Government servant from some-
where on the coast, the stewards, watch-
ing George Manton head for the capi-
tal, spat overboard.
In Perth, the mamas with daughters
held their dances, conversations, and
musical evenings for him, which George
so often failed to appear at. The hotel
by the Swan (only place in town worth
staying at), the club (man’s spiritual
home), and Government House (chap’s
always welcome there), these were his
life until it was time to board another
ship for Melbourne and the Cup.
Whatever stories of George’s life in
Melbourne seeped back to the West
from time to time, the mamas of Perth
were more than surprised and put out
of countenance when, one Christmas,
George returned with a wife. Their
chagrin led them into extravagances
of conjecture regarding the conduct of
a young Melbourne girl thrown into
the strange new world of the Nor’-
West. Some foresaw her running home
to Mother. Others expected love affairs
with handsome jackaroos. Others were
of the opinion she would take to drink.
She would never manage the house-
hold “blacks.” Her heart would break
when the children had to come down
to Perth for their schooling. Boredom
would be the death of her, one so
young, with no station background,
married to George Manton. “Much too


unsophisticated for Manton. Most un-
fitted for station life.”
None of these forecasts was proved
correct.
For all the years that Faye Manton
remained the wife of one of the richest
of the West’s pastoral plutocracy, she
never set foot on those fabulous plains
that were the source of the Manton
incomes. When George brought her off
the ship from the eastern States with
her trunks and boxes, her Persian cats,
her canaries in their ormolu cages, her
three-month-old son Young George
Manton, and her sister Myola Cavan;
when George ushered his menage ashore
he headed straight for the Pink House:
and the Pink House rejnained Faye
Manton’s home until she died.
The year was 1909. The year before
that, George had worked his black-
fellers as usual, sired his half-caste sons
as usual, Faye in Melbourne had car-
ried his first son to bear his name, and
the Pink House had been built.
Desmond and Gordon Manton had
spent their holidays, their one annual
break from the endless detail of Manton
Plains, immersed in the new but still
seemingly endless detail associated with
the building of their brother’s town
house. There were masons from Italy,
terrazzo artists from Venice, the Mar-
seilles roof tiles had a French fixer to
put them in place.
Walls were lovingly panelled in
exotic timbers, and parquet floors were
laid, and there were leadlights, windows
and doors of rose-tinted glass that
called for men from Belgium to frame
them in situations advantageous to the
lighting and embellishment of rooms
and verandas. Surrounded by its five
acres of paddocks, the Pink House
nestled in one corner under the lee of
the stand of Moreton Bay figs planted
by the Manton grandfather in the far-
off days when he lived, a bachelor, in
his bat house two miles fropi the capi-
tal’s main street, along a cart track
through the sand. Now, in 1909 they
were a landmark, the Moreton Bay figs,
a focal point in the rapidly rising
suburbs north of the town ... a worthy
setting for the Pink House. With its
stables, carriage sheds, lofts, its wind-
mill, with Francine the milch cow shar-
ing the paddock with the pet lamb
Pitti-sing and Myola’s hack, Floradora,
the Pink House was indeed a jewel in
its acre of lawns and English flowers
... a fitting home for the wife and
children of George Manton and their
Aunt Myola.
Thereafter, each year George would
descend from the Plains, leave the Pink
House and the children in the care of
this trustworthy aunt, take his wife to
the Melbourne Cup, where her beauty
and her lavish dressing, her charm and
grace would be freely acknowledged by
the world of fashion and wealth. Back
home in the Pink House, George would
give a party, the one Manton enter-
tainment of the year, the fabulous Man-
ton New Year party, which started
with a morning picnic under the More-
ton Bay figs for parents and children
alike, finishing with breakfast on the
East Veranda for those of the one hun-
dred guests who survived the cham-
pagne hospitality of the dinner and
dance.
By first ship after the party, George
would return to the Nor’-West, leav-
ing his wife in Perth to produce
another son by midwinter . . . until
that hibernal period came when Eng-
land went to war with the Kaiser and
the three Manton brothers came down
to the Pink House by first ship from
the North.
George arranged his commission and
one for Gordon in the first troop of
Nor’-West Light Horse, sent Desmond
back to see the war through growing
wool for the Empire on Manton Plains,
kissed his wife and Young George, John,
Henry, Gilbert, and Ronald, committed
them to the care of Myola, and rode
away from the Pink House, to the war.
The days and weeks and months
passed at the Pink House as they do
in places removed from the noise of
battle.
“I don’t understand why they don’t
let George Manton come home to us.”
George Manton’s wife said it prettily,
frowning delicately. Her sister reproved
automatically, “You’ll get wrinkles.”
Then, practically, “Dysentery isn’t very
serious, after all . . . not serious enough
to send him all the way back here.”
Faye shuddered, again with delicacy,
at the word applied to her husband,
and Myola, who was still seeing Young
George, John, Henry, Gilbert, and
the others, including the new Margot,
through their childish attacks, smiled
at the thought of what a leveller it
could be. In the meantime, while Gor-
don was busy getting himself killed at
Gallipoli, George nursed his own stub-
born complaint in Cairo. The Army
seemed to forget him then, allowing
him no chance of showing his bravery
from such places as Cairo Base Hos-
pital or Horseferry Road, where he
found himself for the rest of the war.
Then there was no longer any war
to concern the Australian Light Horse;
what was left of those who had em-
barked from the West came home;
except George Manton. He preferred
a quiet, small villa in Kensington, Lon-
don, plus a quiet, small villa at Antibes,
to the Pink House, Perth. Soon it be-
came apparent that he preferred the
company of Lilli the girl from Paris
and their son, Robert, produced inad-
vertently by Lilli early in her wartime
association with this colonial officer
of her country’s gallant ally; preferred
their company to that of Faye and
Young George, John, Henry, Gilbert,
and the others back home in the West.
“Yes, it’s all very confusing,” Faye
would admit to Myola in those post-
war days of the early ’twenties. “I’m
here with you and the children. There’s
no doubting that, is there? The child-
ren are too solid not to be real.”
“And there’s Gordon lying cold in his
grave on foreign soil and Desmond up
there on the Plains by himself.”
“With a full station staff,” Myola
would remind her, passing over the dis-
tant grave. “And the natives.”
“And there’s Manton in London. It’s
all so confusing.”
“Why don’t you go over to him?
Take the children.” Myola was a woman
of action, but her sister blanched at the
idea.
“No, no. Manton would never allow
it. We must be patient. He will come
home.”
There, Faye was right. Come home,
he would. But wheh?
George remained in London and
Antibes with his Lilli, and when she
left him to keep an inescapable appoint-
ment elsewhere, George reorganised his
life by transferring the care of his son
Robert, called Robaire, to the enduring
hands of Myola at the Pink House,
Faye fluttering in the background,
George, himself remaining seemingly
content to move between Kensington
and the Riviera.
Robaire had unexpectedly thoughtful
eyes, legacy probably of Lilli. Certainly
not of George. An unusual lad he was,
at thirteen years, unsure of himself
mainly, it seemed, because of Uncle
George. When you know that your
father has a real wife and family in
Australia, when you know that you’re
different in that respect from other boys
around you, and when your mother
doesn’t seem to mind, well, maybe
“Uncle George” sounds better than
“Father.” So George Manton had be-
come in the avuncular and Robaire con-
tinued to be unsure of himself. Until
he arrived at the Pink House, Perth.
“He’s not really your uncle, is he?”
Margot, Faye’s youngest, had a fellow
feeling for Robaire; Margot, the only
one of the Pink House flock who gave
time from her own absorbing affairs
to communicate with this strange
relative wished on the family. “He’s
really not your uncle. He’s your
father.”
“And yours, too,” Robaire would
remind her, “even though you call
him ‘Uncle George,’ too.”
“Well,” with earnest consideration,
“I haven’t met him yet, he hasn’t seen
me, I’m fourteen, nearly; it looks to
me as though he doesn’t care about
being my father, so, well, I think per-
haps ‘Uncle George’ does sound best.”
So it remained, their secret wonder-
ings about George a bond between
them; the years went by until the day
that Robaire came home in the blue

of the Air Force, home to a Pink House
already clamorous with the khaki-clad
leave-takings of Young George, John,
Henry, Gilbert, and the others, bound
for the Middle East or places there-
abouts.
“I’m on draft for Parafield, that’s
South Australia,” he told the family;
and later that evening, out of the
hurly-burly, “Margot, it looks as
though I might have to go anywhere
in the world . . . England, Canada. The
Empire Air Training Scheme can send
us anywhere.”
Margot whispered, “I can’t bear to
think of your not being here, Robaire.”
Robaire, visioning the years ahead, or
would there be only months? . . .
Robaire said, “I can’t think of life
without you, anywhere, Margot. What
can we do?”
Myola Cavan supplied the answer.
First, she sought out her sister.
“Faye Manton,” she said, “you’ve
known for a long time those two are
in love.”
Faye protectively dissembled. “In
love? Robaire and Margot? They can’t
be . . . they’re, they’re . . .”
‘.‘They’re what?”
“He’s her half-brother. How can
they be in love? Nothing can come of
it.”
Myola put down the khaki sock she
was knitting.
“I heard them tonight on the East
Veranda. Voices carry to my room.
It isn’t the first time I’ve heard lovers
there.”
“Young George and John and the
others did their courting there.” Faye
laughed, but not with the complacency
of a fond mother.
“And others.” Myola was watching
as a cat might watch a bird on the
grass. “I remember one night in par-
ticular. A long time ago, Faye. You’ll
remember, too. The night you met
someone there, it was the night be-
fore . . . before George sailed with
the Light Horse.”
Faye let out her breath carefully.
“Well? George! What of it? George
and I ... he was going away . . .
my husband . . .”
“A pretty little fabrication, Faye.
Or, rather, it’s a black lie. What one
might almost call a downright wicked
lie . . . only we Cavans were taught
not to use such words, weren’t we?”
Faye laughed again, a vague, brush-
all-this-aside kind of laugh, that flut-
tered with her hands and faded into
nothing.
“Don’t be wicked, Faye, any more
wicked than you’ve been already. Don’t
ruin two more lives. Tell the truth. Tell
Robaire he can marry Margot. If you
don’t, I will. Tell Margot . .
“What?”
“Tell her she’s not George’s
daughter.”
“No!”
“I’ll tell her, then. I’ll tell her I
waited for Gordon that last night . . .”
Now Faye smiled; the simper of the
cat that has already caught and eaten
and enjoyed the bird. “Yes. You
waited. But Gordon came to me.”
Myola rose. “It’s too long ago now,
Faye. Too many years of forgetting.
You can’t hurt me any more. But you
won’t spoil Margot’s life as well as
mine. I won’t let you. Margot and
Robaire are only cousins. They can
marry.” She was at the door. “Will you
leave it to me to tell them?”
Faye turned her face from the light.
Was it the glow from the rose-colored
window, or did she blush? She nodded.
“Yes. You tell them for me. I can’t.”
“You wouldn’t even spare me this,”
Myola said, her spinsterhood frozen on
her face for a moment as she turned
from the mother of the Manton brood,
“you who had so much.”
Robaire and Margot were married
and on a breathless day when Margot
sat, heavy-bodied under the Moreton
Bay fig trees of the historied house,
Robaire met the death in the sky he
had expected, over the Arafura Sea; so
he never saw his son, Young Robert.
In her due time Faye died, having had
the grace to transfer to Myola, to live
in and enjoy, the Pink House, Faye’s
wedding gift from George.
George, who had known all along
what farewells had been made at the
Pink House during that pre-embarka-
tion week in 1914, George, who had
rationalised Lilli and Robaire as a can-
celling out of one such farewell, George
had nothing to say about the marriage
of Margot and his son; and no one
bothered to tell him that the Pink House
was now Myola’s.
So the years went by until, a slight
attack of nostalgia for Manton Plains
creeping in to keep his gout some com-
pany, George sent hi s cable . . . “Sail-
ing from Southampton . . .” and Great
Aunt Myola passed the Pink House to
the Listing Bureau, who sold it to her
advantage. With some of the money she
gave Young Robert, clerk in the Manton
office, a full-time course in civil flying.
Uncle George died on his way through
the Suez and was buried at sea. Prince
Igor? No one wanted a flea-bitten old
dalmatian hound, so he went to the
Dogs’ Home. Where the Pink House
once stood there is now a modern and
commodious service station, lubritorium,
and garage.
Great Aunt Myola has a pair of
bookends and a paperweight made
from the wood of one of the Moreton
Bay figs which the bulldozers pushed
down. Last heard of her, she was head-
ing, with the cash from the Pink House
sale in her pocket, for the Nor’-West,
where she plans to spend her next few
years tracing the products of George
Manton’s early miscegenations.
Myola, always a stickler about family
relationships, has a conscience about
them, too.
(Among this generation of authenti-
cated Mantons a slight frigidness exists
over the Georgian and the Venetian,
Myola having, en passant, indicated that
they could fight out its disposition
among themselves.)

“Dear Mr. Kerr
FV e got it straight now.
Ife called
Clarified Butter.
What doldo with it?”
“Well, we're over the first hurdle, aren't we?
Now, what do you do with it? That's easy to
answer. You cook meals that are tastier,
more tender, more digestible than any
you've cooked before. Clarified Butter, you
see, is simply pure dairy butter with the
water, salt and curd removed. It gives your
cooking the natural goodness and flavour of
pure dairy butter—brings out the flavour of
the food itself in a way nothing else can. By
the way, you use Clarified Butter much more
sparingly than other cooking fats and oils;
just enough to cover the bottom of the pan
produces first class results every time. And
you use it at lower temperatures, too. So
you'll find that protein fibres are cooked
more gently; they don’t toughen up. Try this
recipe, it's a good way to get to know just
how much Clarified Butter can add to the
pleasure of eating. (P.S. Sorry to confuse
you at this stage but Clarified Butter is also
sold as Ghee or Butter Oil.)

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
A way to keep
children healthy
and parents happy
HOUSEWIVES WITH YOUNG
families often confess to me that they
are confused about whether to prepare
meals with herbs, spices, and wine for
their children. The mothers find that
children don’t like richly seasoned
dishes, mainly because they are not
used to them.
Of course, there are exceptions,
especially some young mothers who
start their children early on an interest-
ing and varied diet. I know several who
feed their three- and four-year-olds on
meals which include wine. A dish con-
taining wine that has been simmered
for five minutes has no alcoholic con-
tent. Having made this quite clear, I
can own up to the fact that my chil-
dren eat fish and meat garnished with
wine sauces.
Where children take their evening
meal with their parents, it is not prac-
ticable to cook separate meals for the
different age groups, and the tendency
is for parents to fall in with the desires
of their children. This is not a good
thing, because by the time the children
get off one’s hands there has been
about 15 years of standard, bland
cookery, and it isn’t easy after such a
long time to adopt more venturesome
eating patterns.
So how can a family with such estab-
lished eating habits change its ways for
the better by cooking with herbs,
wines, and spices without upsetting
the kids?
One answer is to give the children
their meal about five o’clock. At this
point a couple of hundred amateur
child psychologists will leap into the
fray with impassioned statements like
“parents should eat with their children
in order to create a bond within the
family,” etc., etc. Well, I say.it is
better for the children if there is affec-
tion between the parents, and this isn’t
normally generated over the dinner
table if the parents eat early with the
children, when the husband has just
returned, tired, from work, the wife is
exhausted from arbitrating on after-
school quarrels and preparing dinner,
and even the children are often too
tired to eat.
With all the things we have to dis-
tract us at home these days, radio, TV,
records, newspapers, books, magazines,
it’s all too easy to be uncommunicative,
but the dinner table is one place where
these interruptions should not be
allowed. It should be the place where,
after a full day, parents communicate
with each other and older children.
So now let’s think about the younger
children again. They go to school either
with a packed lunch or 20 cents, per-
haps, to spend at the tuck shop. They
mainly eat sandwiches, and I doubt
that this way they get enough protein,
the raw material which is turned into
energy, according to the child’s require-
ment, by a complex system of con-
version to sugar through the liver.
If insufficient protein is given to
the child in the middle of the day, the
calls for energy in the afternoon
energy to play or to study can’t be
fully met. The result is inattentiveness
and lack of vitality. By the time the
child gets home, tiredness creates the
familiar problems at mealtimes.
I believe the only answer is to give
children a hot, protein-packed meal at
school at midday. They would then need
only a light, snack meal in the even-
ing. Easily prepared, it would not con-
flict with the preparation of the adults’
meal, and the children would go to
bed on a relatively light stomach, which
is so much better for them.
For a hot midday meal at school,
facilities would have to be provided by
the Education authorities. They would
also have to arrange contracts with
caterers, fix rigid specifications for
acceptable standards, and employ food
supervisors to see that the standards
were maintained.
There is now a midday break of one
hour in which to play and eat lunch
(but maybe it gets thrown away on the
way home). An extra half-hour would
have to be added if a hot meal was
supplied. This would mean getting
home half an hour later, and, of course,
would affect transport schedules. The
repercussions are far-reaching, but this
action has already been taken in many
countries.
Probably the nearest country to us
in culture is the United Kingdom, and
I understand that there the charge
made for school lunches is 33 cents a
day, paid by the parents. I imagine
that here, for that money, an excellent
meal could be provided.
I have spoken to several headmasters
who shall be nameless because of
the obvious political implications
and they support this view 100 percent.
They are concerned about the falling
off in attention in the afternoons, and
also worried about the standard of
packaged luncheons.
They feel a hot-meal service would
benefit the academic standards of their
students. So now it’s over to parents.
If you are worried about the health,
the physical and mental welfare of
your children, then support the case for
hot school meals. Urge your Parents
and Citizens’ Association to look into
the question, and to make recommen-
dations to the Department of Educa-
tion. We, the parents, are going to have
to bring this reform about.

Shooting kangaroos
The amount of hysterical pub-
licity about shooting kangaroos during
the past couple of years, together with
your cartoon (8., August 26), requires
an answer from the other side of the
fence.
It is about time all those whose
imagination has been stirred by grim
pictures of Australia without any kan-
garoos bestirred their imagination a
little more and tried to see the situ-
ation as it is, not as lots of well-
intentioned but ill-informed public
figures think it will be.
First let us imagine Australia as it
was before the white man ventured
into the drier parts. Millions of square
miles of country with no kangaroos.
Quite simple, because there was no
water, no kangaroos. Also none of the
kangaroo’s main enemies, the Abori-
ginal and the dingo. No doubt, the
kangaroos spread into some of this
country during the wet and stayed
while surface water lasted.
This being so, the place to find kan-
garoos would have been within travel-
ling distance of waters. These waters
would have been the domain of the
Aboriginal and the dingo, too, both
depending for a lot of their protein
on kangaroo. I would venture that the
’roo’s lot was not a happy one in those
days.
All of this country is occupied and
watered now. It is also well covered
with kangaroos. These kangaroos, even
with present-day hunting methods,
have a much easier time than their
forebears. Not many Aborigines live
on ’roo meat these days, and the dingo
is to some extent controlled.
It is important to recognise here that
kangaroo shooters are in business
whether they are after skins or car-
casses. They will not stay and shoot
country once the ’roos become thinned
out or gun shy. They are only after
mature kangaroos and do not disturb
young and partly grown ones.
Another point the critics have not
been able to imagine is the sheer vast-
ness of the country. The areas I’m talk-
ing about would extend upwards from
4000 acres. Even 4000 acres is three
miles by two. Can any critic imagine
driving about in an area even this size
at night and seeing every kangaroo, let
alone getting within range of it
I live on a block of 14,000 acres.
More or less five by four miles, which
was in an area shot over by a profes-
sional shooter last year. He took over
500 kangaroos here and similar num-
bers on similar areas. It is nothing to
see mobs of 20 ’roos about now. These
figures are common all around here,
and in parts the ’roos taken are many
times higher, but they are still seen,
in these areas, in droves.
It is time people realised that the
only way country of this area could
be free of ’roos would be if a major
drive was undertaken. If kept up long
enough, a given area may be freed of
’roos for a while. It would only be a
few weeks, though, when they’d be
creeping back from the bordering
country.
To conclude, I’d like to quote from
the August issue of the “Queensland
Agricultural Journal” an article written
by a zoologist. The conclusion of an
article about the red kangaroos states:
“There is no field evidence that the
present level of shooting, which has
been virtually unchanged since 1887,
has had any detrimental effect on the
red kangaroo in Queensland.”

Catholic education
Brian Buckley has played plenty
of discords in his article on Catholic
education (8., August 26) in fact,
quite a few notes seem to be missing
entirely in his presentation of the work.
Education has a much wider key range
than the mere acquisition of the ability
to secure lucrative employment. A
Catholic education does this in its
application of a score of standards to
guide a child through life standards
which if not supplied in the home must
be either undertaken by the schools
or churches.
Scholastically the results compare
favorably with non-Catholic schools,
which is quite an achievement when
one considers that these church schools
are understaffed, or staffed at most
times by teachers who are not always
university graduates and who are not
even paid in the currency of Caesar as
an added incentive. These teachers give
a child an appreciation of the often-
neglected intangibles in life virtue,
beauty, spirituality, happiness or
as quoted of Mary McCarthy the
aesthetic outlet. One of these outlets,
as quite derogatively appreciated by
Brian Buckley, is the hymn singing
which goes hand in hand with the
recitation of the multiplication tables.
Why is this method of praising God and
His Kingdom a lesson in love
any different than the age-old lullaby,
the raising of voices in patriotism, or
honoring the flag?
The cry of the present day is con-
cupiscence in teenagers how can
such a system of education which in-
culcates personal chastity be cited as
something not-quite-with-it. Children
today are using their own slide rule of
morality not surprising when even
clergy are dissenting on points of
virtue. Religion, together with sport
and instruction, should all be part of
education, and not be doled like water
out of a tap. That is the kind of
Catholic education a child receives. A

In Western Australia the Teachers'
Union has expressed concern at the
effect of State co-educational high
schools on increase in juvenile delin-
quency theft in boys, immorality in
girls. Perhaps Archbishop Vaughan was
then right in describing purely secular
schools as “seedplots of future immor-
ality, infidelity, and lawlessness.”
Education which leaves out God and
his religious worship suggests to child-
ren that God and His Commandments
do not matter. Thus secular education
in State schools is not an acceptable
alternative to Catholic schooling where,
in the words of the English Hadow
Report, "the teaching of religion lies
at the heart of all teaching.”
It is thus that Catholic parents
throughout Australia have combined to
make Independent school education a
political and social reality. In this they
are now joined by all other Indepen-
dent schools.

Tasmania was first
In your article “Best Teeth” (8.,
August 26) the impression is given that
South Australia is the first State in
the Commonwealth to undertake a
School Dental Nursing scheme. I would
like to draw attention to the fact that
such a scheme has, in fact, been in
operation for two years already in Tas-
mania. The first 10 students will com-
plete their two years’ diploma course
this coming December.
The Tasmanian School of Dental
Nursing was based on the New Zealand
one, and received much assistance and
advice from that country. The school
at present has twenty students in train-
ing, ten first year, ten second year. Girls
may commence training between the
ages of seventeen and twenty-five and
should have reached matriculation stan-
dard or similar. They are paid dur-
ing training and on graduation are
allotted to schools all over the State.
They will then work in clinics or cara-
vans located near to the schools.
At present the ten second-year
students operate, under supervision, ten
dental chairs at the Dental School in
Hobart. Outstanding results are be-
ing achieved with children at this clinic
and parents are most satisfied. Already
many children are receiving treatment
which might have been delayed in-
definitely but for the Dental Nursing
Service.

Buttering dairy-farmers
Your comment in July (8., July 22)
and three-page cover story on dairying
continued to see no merit in dairy-
farmers nor did it mention the in-
dustry’s real problems.
It is true that farm incomes vary
widely, but this is true of members of
all industries and all wage structures.
To evaluate an industry’s economy on
either the highest or the lowest income
earners is quite wrong.
The only true yardstick is to mea-
sure the farmers’ incomes relative to
dollars invested and labor used. All
secondary and tertiary industries are
assessed on this basis, so why should
rural industries be assessed on mumbo-
jumbo?
A high-income farm may have a
lower co-efficiency than a lower-income
one. Is there any other industry which
does not have the majority of its mem-
bers on a lower-income group?
If Australia is to develop it must
industrialise, and it cannot do this
without substantial initial protection to
secondary industry. This protection and
consequent industrial boom has grossly
inflated cost structures and placed a
tremendous burden on local industries
with export affiliations.
That these must receive some com-
pensatory assistance is conceded by all
know ledgeable and fair-minded people.
Even in 1960-61 primary industry (in
tariff and subsidy support) received
$l7O million, while secondary industry
(a near non-export earner) received
$9OO million (Vernon report). Need
more be said?

I wish to comment on your agricultural
writer’s conclusion (8., August 26)
concerning the disagreement between
my findings and those of CSIRO Pros-
pect.
The Journal in which my article was
published is a research publication and
as such it represents a forum for scien-
tific findings and opinions. Obviously
the very fact that my results disagree
with those of other authors is alone
of scientific interest, and in my con-
clusions you will find the statement
that: “It is hoped that these preliminary
observations may stimulate further
work in this field.”
These results are thus not the basis
of any extension recommendation, in
fact, until a lot more work is done it
is difficult to know what will be
recommended. When and if a change
in husbandry practice is recommended
it will be based on much more work
than two conflicting pieces. At that
time I am sure it will be made by
informed extension officers, with the
support of both CSIRO and the
Department of Agriculture.

GROWING
WITH A NATION!
The rapid development of Australia, as a great commercial
nation, is plainly evident wherever one may look. Rapid growth
calls for an equally rapid extension of power. To match this
extension. Olympic Cables provide a continually expanding
range of high power transmission cables & conductors.
This vast span of aluminium cable across the Appleton Docks
in Melbourne is one example of how Olympic Cables help the
nation live and work better electrically.
