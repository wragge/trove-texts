MOST famous of Scotland’s
storied Western isles is lona,
which had its fame long before
Edinburgh was a village, before
William sailed over from Nor-
mandy. The fame of lona rests
upon its association with the
Christianising of the Piets and
Scots, for it was to lona that the first
missionary came. He was St.
Columba, who landed from Ireland
and founded a monastery here in the
year 563. In the ninth century lona
was made a bishopric in the province
of Trondhejm, when Norway had
rights over the island. Later, about
1507, the old bishopric having be-
come extinct, a new one was created
and the thirteenth-century abbey
church of St. Mary became the
Cathedral of the Isles. During the
Reformation the cathedral was ex-
tensively damaged. The property
passed eventually to the eighth Duke
of Argyll, who presented the ruins
of the old cathedral to the Church
of Scotland, and in 1905, after
restoration had been carried out, the
cathedral was reopened. The Scot-
tish kings from the second Fergus to
Macbeth were buried here, and
among the historic remains is a
memorial of a Macquarrie of Ulva
with its effigy of a chief in battle
array, the memorial of a Lord of the
Isles with an interesting galley and
the monument of Macleod of Mac-
leod in the centre of the chancel.

LACHLAN MACQUARIE .
Lachlan Macquarie, His Life, Adven-
tures and Times, by M. ,H. Ellis
(Dymock’s), is the story of an extra-
ordinary Scotsman who was born in
1761, governed N. S. Wales from 1810 to
1821, and died in 1824.
Unimpeded by those constitutional re-
straints which forced most of his suc-
cessors to become figureheads, Macquarie
did govern N. S. Wales. It is almost true
to say that he re-created the “outpost of
Empire” which Governor Phillip had con-
templated in 1788, and which ignoble
land-grabbers, trade-monopolists, weak
Governors and uninterested British
Cabinets had allowed to deteriorate into
chaos.
When Macquarie assumed office in
1810 neither the colonists nor the Home
Government knew precisely what N.S.W.
was or what it might become. In such
circumstances the imaginative Macquarie
made his own plans for the fashioning
of the settlement, adapting them to what
he thought was British policy—or what
he thought should be British policy.
Under his impetuous and energetic
leadership the settlement rapidly de-
veloped territorially, economically and
socially. But the liberality of his rehabi-
litation policy, under which ex-convicts
easily became landed proprietors and
were restored to full civil status, was
strongly resented by the free-settler sec-
tion of the community, who feared a pre-
dominant emancipist influence in the
colony of the future. This dissension
came to a head when England had finally
interned Napoleon and had leisure to
study her own domestic problems.
The issues raised in that dissension
were disquieting to the British Cabinet,
which had expended much capital on
transportation, and now, faced with the
problem of getting rid of its redundant
post-war criminal population, learned that
the continued existence of this overseas
penal station was in jeopardy. " Undpr
Macquarie’s rehabilitating policy N. S.
Wales had ceased to be a deterrent to
English criminality, and its obvious
economic progress indicated that a recog-
nition of its free destiny could not be
long delayed. After an official inquiry
a compromise was effected, according to
which the predominance of men of capital
was ensured and British convicts were to
provide the labor for pastoral develop-
ment. Obviously, Macquarie could not
fit into such a policy.
In brief, that is the history which Mr.
Ellis has to expound and amplify in this
book. It is, perhaps, the most important
section of Australian history, for it marks
the end of the specifically penal colonisa-
tion system and the inauguration of free
institutions. Mr. Ellis’s task is to deter-
mine how far Macquarie was personally
responsible for these changes or to what
extent they were due to natural growth
and the efforts of free settlers. Moreover,
he should assess the social and economic
losses or gains that arose out of Mac-
quarie’s daring and stubborn emancipist
policy, and finally adjudicate the his-
torical accusation that Macquarie system-
atically thwarted free immigrant settle-
ment.
These are the greater problems which
dozens of writers have discussed incident-
ally and inadequately for a century.
Three specific surveys have been made of
the Macquarie period. Dr. Marion
Phillips did a fine, but necessarily incom-
plete, piece of work on the subject in
1909 —Macquarie’s personal papers were
not then available. The late Professor
A. G. Wood also essayed the task, leaving
behind him an extensive manuscript,
which in his scholarly fashion he refused
to publish until it should be rewritten
after further research. And recently
Marjorie Barnard published a racily
written and somewhat impressionistic
sketch of the period. Nevertheless, despite
the fact that Macquarie has been more
repeated on than any other Governor,
an arathoritative survey of his career has
been long overdue.
Mr. Ellis’s book is the result of 20
years’ painstaking research in India,
England, Scotland and Australia. His
exhaustive and well classified biblio-
graphy is a welcome aid to students of
history. The text of his book makes it
clear that he has not cursorily scanned
through the voluminous and familiar per-
sonal documents of Macquarie and Bigge,
but that he has digested these to such an
extent that the Macquarie period is as
familiar to him as the twentieth century
is familiar to us. He knows when it
rained; he can generally locate any
prominent official on a given date; he
could have written the biography of every
person of any prominence who was
associated with Macquarie.
Despite its extent of 700 pages the
book reveals a condensation of facts, as
js evident from his numerous source-
references, which are frequently multi-
plied to substantiate the statements made
even in one sentence. The sections which
he devotes to index and reference notes,
each occupying 50 pages, must prove of
inestimable value to students who appre-
ciate finding their historical sources and
leads ready-made for them.
It is essential that the reader should
make up his mind whether he wants to
view this book as a biography of Mac-
quarie or as a history of the Macquarie
period. The art of the biographer differs
from that of the historian; one portrays
the man in his times and the other out-
lines the trends and movements in which
the man functioned. Mr. Ellis’s book is
essentially a biography, one of the best
biographies written in our times. Though
he could have done so, he does not sub-
divide his story into the specific economic
or constitutional divisions of the historical
method, but leaves the way clear for
others to follow along these lines, while
clearly indicating to them how they
should go about it.
A few of our Governors are worthy of
biographies. Phillip and Bligh justly
have been honored in this way. Bourke
and Gipps also deserve the honor. Mac-
quarie pre-eminently deserved it and was
providentially adapted as a biographical
subject from his romantic youth to his
tragic and premature death, which was
the penalty paid by him for his indefatig-
able labor in Australia.
Only seldom are such colorful subjects
presented to biographers. His qualities
were manifold but diverse. He had cul-
ture, imagination, idealism, romance,
generosity, honesty and industry. He was
grandiose, power-loving, stubborn, im-
petuous, 'hasty in judgment, vain, even
vindictive on rare occasions. An aristo-
crat, contemptuous of some of the new
and dubiously rich Australian gentry, he
turned appraisingly to emancipists, who
not infrequently failed to appreciate what
it cost him in loss of prestige to lift them
from the gutters, where other Governors
would have been content to leave them.
His virtues and faults have proved a
godsend to the multitudes who have
lightly pronounced judgment on Mac-
quarie. Mr. Ellis, however, makes it
clear that many of these shortcomings
were not so pronounced as we had been
led to believe. He does not balk at the
episode of the flogging of the free men,
which was an impetuous mistake, but
he reveals the sordid background of
intrigue that worked it up into a major
governmental crime. In the light of
accumulated details, some of which are
new, the reader cannot fail to appreciate
a considerable degree of forbearance in
Macquarie under the expertly contrived
and long-drawn-out campaign of opposi-
tion directed against him by highly placed
officials of Church and State.
It was well worth' waiting a century
to have this satisfactory biography
written. It could have been done less well
in the earlier years when writing was
slipshod and lacking in historical method.
Worse still, it could have been under-
taken in recent 8 times by that shallow
school of “debunkers of history,” whose
“only muse,” as Charles Morgan said of
them, “was the spiteful which they dig-
nified with the name of ironic.” These
are the people who would have exploited
the constant appearance of the name
“Macquarie” attached to foundation-
stones, streets, rivers and settlements.
But Mr. Ellis enters on his task joy-
ously, making the Macquarie career sane
and balanced, picturesque, but also tragic.
He writes buoyantly, adopting, strangely
enough, in so large a book which follows
the classical traditions of biographical
presentation, the recognised journalistic
style of brief paragraphing. Nevertheless,
the general tone of the book is lyrical.
See this in the chapter titles, which at
first appear disconcerting, but later emerge
as adroit summaries of episodes and
periods. “The Dashing Lieutenant” as
the key to the early period of Macquarie,
which in Scotland and India is a fascinat-
ing story. “Lord Ullen’s Daughter” is
obviously that charming Lady who shared
her husband’s triumphs and inspired his
ambitions for the penal settlement. “The
Dangerous Contagion” is almost com-
mentary enough on the machinations of
the coteries of the Bents and Marsden.
And “John M’Arthur Holds Trumps”
speaks as volumes might about the man
who wanted to hold and extend his
50,000 acres and threatened to make a
monopoly of his Merinos if thwarted,
kowtowed to Commissioner Bigge,
engineered and consolidated the opposi-
tion against Macquarie in London, and
simultaneously went “fawning to the un-
suspecting Governor to warn him privily”
of the Commissioner’s prejudices against
him. Nevertheless Mr. Ellis is sufficiently
judicious to appreciate the pioneering and
economic importance of that inexplicable
John M’Arthur!
As might be expected from so ex-
haustive a study, Mr. Ellis throws much
new light on the history of the period,
sometimes by discovering new facts, but
more frequently by giving the correct
emphasis to, or interpretation of, facts
already known.
Without attempting to analyse the book
in this review, which is meant generally
to introduce this interesting volume to
the public, I shall mention only a few
instances where the author’s fuller know-
ledge clarifies historical points or where,
I believe, he might have expanded his
observations. For example, he corrects
the prevalent notion that Macquarie’s
foundation of the Bank of N.S.W. was
a haphazard, hastily-conceived thing. It
was economically necessary, considered
over a long period by reputable citizens,
and its legality was determined by the
highest legal authority in the colony.
Mr. Ellis is particularly interesting on
the procedure of Bigge’s Enquiry in the
colony, but makes, I think, an insuffi-
cient analysis of Bigge’s ultimate findings.
It might be said, of course, that the Bigge
Reports were published after the Mac-
quarie period, but because they were
fundamental judgments on the past and
the key to the future, they merit a very
full consideration. The author, how-
ever, makes a brief but potent use of
that comparatively little-known docu-*
ment, submitted by Macquarie to the
House of Commons in 1822 in reply to
Bigge’s published first Report. This per-
sonal vindication and apologia was not
published as a Parliamentary Paper until
1828.
The account given by Mr. Ellis of the
opposition waged by the brothers Bent,
the only Judges then in the colony, clearly
demonstrates the harassing and undigni-
fied tactics adopted by them. Neither of
them was an inspiration to a community
just emerging from lawlessness. But, in
this instance, Mr. Ellis should have ex-
pounded the badly-defined legal situation
of the colony, dating back to the original
and deficient grant of civil jurisdiction of
1787 and still left obscure by the new
Charter of Justice that became effective
in 1814.
This vulgarly-expressed controversy in-
volved fundamental issues, such as the
freedom of the judiciary, as contemplated
by the Bents, and the absolute power of
the Crown, as envisaged by Macquarie.
The surprising feature of this problem
was that Great Britain failed to recognise
its importance, and deliberately or through
default allowed this indeterminate legal
situation to develop and endure until
1823 —possibly because it desired to await
the findings of the Commission of Inquiry
determined on by Bathurst in 1817.
Also, it is a little disappointing to find
that Mr. Ellis does not critically examine
and analyse the conflicting tables of
statistics, relative to population, stock,
land-grants and the productivity of the
settlement at the end of the Macquarie
regime, I refer to the earlier Bigge
Appendix figures, those contained in the
Emancipists’ Petition, and those supplied
by Macquarie himself at the end of his
career. Mr. Ellis, of course, uses these
statistics and also refers to those of
1822-28, but does not, I think, discuss
them adequately.
The solution of the Macquarie prob-
lems and controversies hinges largely on
these figures, and a true assessment of
them is necessary for any clear view of
"the economic condition of emancipists
and freemen after his long administration.
For many years historians, particularly
the economic historians such as Shann,
have refused to jump this hurdle, and
consequently have drawn generalised con-
clusions that lack conviction.
However, those observations should
not be regarded as indicating major faults
in this excellent volume. As I said at the
beginning of this review, the volume must
primarily be regarded as biography. And
it is biography of a very high order,
based on accurate research and presented
with judgment and restraint. Like any
other good biography of a highly im-
portant person of national significance, it
should inspire historians to make speci-
alised studies of the wider problems which
are indicated in it, such as the legal and
economic issues to which I have referred.
It is a worthy study of an Australian
pioneer who was, if not the greatest, one
of the greatest figures in our history.
This biography is for the general reader
as well as for the student. It is a story
of amazing interest, portraying romance,
adventure, conflict and generosity, quali-
ties that are rarely found in the more
sophisticated leaders of today. Those
who are inclined to believe that the
twentieth century is pre-eminently the
age of supermen in politics might profit-
ably learn from this volume that high
levels of personal integrity and public
devotedness could have been, and were,
manifested in the penal settlement of Aus-
tralia more than a century ago.
It would be unjust to conclude with-
out congratulating the publishers on the
expertness of their work. This is one of
the best productions of recent times and
(priced at two guineas) favorably com-
pares with those books that have been
issued in limited editions at rare intervals,
at rare prices and for those rare people
who are wealthy enough to buy them.

Poems by Mary Finnin.
Every year, or regularly enough to
give that impression, Mary Finnin brings
out a new book of verse, usually with a
few poems reprinted from The Bulletin.
The latest is Alms for Oblivion (W. A.
Hamer Pty., Ltd.), containing 33 poems.
Neither the Harbor nor the Yalta
bursts into flame on these occasions ; and
for this, good as the work is, there are
reasons. Take the verse at its best, as
in the impressionistic sketch of daybreak
entitled “Watch Tower” —
and, though fine, it is also elusive almost
to the point of vanishing. There is a
tiny crystal of clarity and delight, solid
enough to be recognised as minor poetry
of genuine quality, but so minute that
both reader and writer are only just able
to hold it in the mind’s eye: “thought
spins in pinpoint light.” The vision is
too rarefied to make a great blaze in
the world.
Moreover, unless the writer happens
to be born a Shaw Neilson, and even he
slipped into repetition, a vision so pre-
carious is not easy to fix and fasten in
verse. Everywhere among Mary Finnin’s
poems there are fine thoughts and phrases
—trees “large-hearted as a bird,” the
“flower-face” of an owl —but often it
seems that the original inspiration has
been lost. As in “Breaking of the
Drought,” the form wanders ; or as in
many shorter poems, the precision of
truly inspired expression gives way to a
medieval romanticism of phrase.
In such poems as “Dark King Passes”:
Big mob moon sit down
Since white things came,
Firesticks growing from Their hands,
Mouthing smoke and flame —
Mary Finnin has made an attempt,
influenced by nationalistic trends in Aus-
tralian poetry, to rid herself of her
“javelins,” “rigadoons,” “harlequins,”
“liveries,” “wolves,” “dragons” and other
too facile aids to enchantment, but here
the writer has surrendered to another kind
of facileness: readymade, popular
emotion. Her “dark king” is a creation
of the city intellectuals.
It does not matter, ultimately, whether
a writer expresses himself in terms of
javelins or tractors. Walter de la Mare
is still a finer poet than Cecil Day Lewis.
The important question is whether or not
the imagery helps or hinders the clearest
possible expression of the original inspira-
tion. In Mary Finnin’s case the medieval-
isms are an obstruction, interlopers. She
sets out to write about parrots, and finds
they have turned into harlequins. She
sets out to make a “crystal cup” of a
mountain lake and, after filling it with a
noble “mountain image, two miles high,”
turns the cup into “paradise”—which is
a facile word, a popular word and, how-
ever sincere her religious beliefs may be,
not what she meant to say at all.
Because they say exactly tvhat the
writer wants to say, conveying her own
emotion, in her own words and from her
own observation, such light and amusing
poems as “Monday’s Child Is Fair of
Face” (about washing-day) and “Brother
Berg” (comparing a cube of ice in a gin-
squash with an iceberg, like a smaller
edition of Roy Campbell’s poem on a jug
of water) are really preferable to the more
ambitious poems that go astray.
But whether or not the poems wholly
succeed, there is always the feeling of
poetry underlying them ; something which
has half-escaped the writer but which
still is glimpsed in lines and felt in
mood. A strong and attractive Australian
feeling runs through them —even if the
parrots, in an unguarded moment, dance
a “rigadoon,” how many other Australian
poets have written at all of gang-gangs
and galahs?—and the five books of verse
Mary Finnin has published since 1938
provide a substantial background for the
rare lyrics “spinning in pinpoint light.”
Night breathes around
Close as furred hands;
Thought draws me forth
From sleep’s white bands.
Thought spins in pin-point light—
The thief of time —
With colors chiming through windowed
words,
And a lost .rhyme.
Sudden as shaken bells
A blackbird calls, then two,
And into my dancing mind
Bright day breaks through.—

Efow many Australian peers are
there ?
There are only three Australian
peers—Baron Hankey, the South Aus-
tralian-born diplomat and statesman,
formerly secretary to the Council of
Imperial Defence,and later Chancellor
of the Duchy of Lancaster in the
Churchill Ministry; Baron Hunting-
field, a native of Queensland, who
was Governor of Victoria (1934-39);
and Viscount Bruce of Melbourne, a
former Prime Minister of Australia.

Why is Australia comparatively
immune from earthquakes?
Earthquakes invariably occur along
recognised belts, unstable portions
of the earth’s crust known as seismic
faults. Australia at present does not
come within the influence of one of
the greater of these faults, hence its
comparative freedom from earth-
quakes. At the same time there are
weak belts where small disturbances
occasionally occur — for instance,
along the Gulf coast, south of
Adelaide.

Who was it that described Glad-
stone as being “inebriated with the
exuberance of his own verbosity,”
and when and where?
Disraeli, in a speech at Knights-
bridge on July 28, 1878. Gladstone
had shortly before described the Con-
vention of Constantinople as an in-
sane convention, and Disraeli referred
to Gladstone as “A sophistical
rhetorician inebriated with the exuber-
ance of his own verbosity, and gifted
with an egotistical imagination that
can at all times command an in-
terminable and inconsistent series of
arguments to malign his opponents
and glorify himself.”

What causes constitutional acidity?
With incorrect diet the acidity may
be acquired; in certain cases it is
inherited. The latter constitutes the
true or positive type and as such
the trait persists. A badly-balanced
diet tends to aggravate acidosis when
the reserve of alkaline salts is de-
pleted by overuse of certain foods
and lack of others. Red meat, sugar
excess, white bread and fats produce
f c i dity ’ fruit » and green vege-
tabcs alkalinity.

From Mr. John Podsnap, a pom-

Friend. He continually protests
against anything likely to “bring a
blush into the cheek of the young
person” (his daughter), and always
knows the exact design of Providence
(which invariably coincides with his
own).

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
ROUGH ON ROOSEVELT.
If the debunking criticism of
Franklin D. Roosevelt appearing
in various U.S. publications was
being voiced elsewhere the
American outcry would probably
be terrific. Some of it could
not have been worse if Roose-
velt had led the country in a
losing war.
As George Creel puts it in his
generally sympathetic appraisal
Rebel at Arms (published by
Putnam); “Intimates and even
acquaintances have remarked on
Franklin Roosevelt’s preoccupa-
tion with the judgment of history
on his record. Those who
admired and loved him should
be glad that he will not hear it.”
Creel sums up the main case
against Roosevelt;
From the very first he exercised the
right of independent action, making
decisions without the authority of law
or without submission to public
opinion, and hiding his improvisation
under the pretence of military
security. Eyes fixed on the new
world order that would make him
another prince of peace, he handed
out munitions, planes, ships and mil-
lions with never a thought of exacting
promises in return. Had he bargained
realistically, demanding agreements
with respect to post-war policies the
world might not now be shattered into
hate-filled fragments.
That is putting it politely; at
the other extreme are such as
the “Journal-American” writer
Westbrook Pegler; “Day by
day, as the memoirs accumulate,
Roosevelt appears more fatuous
—a grinning, tragic, two-bit
wise-guy, played for a fool by
smarter men who kept him
thinking he, was the smart one.”
Also; “The American people
elected this mischievous faker
four times. Yet the man who
made fools of so many millions
of a breed who think themselves
the shrewdest and most civilised
on earth, himself was played for
a fool for more than a decade
by Josef Stalin.”
Liking none of the Roosevelts,
Pegler has further growled:
“His own son, Elliott hardly
more silly and conceited than
the, old man himself... .wrote a
boastful record, which never will
be expunged, of stupidity and
crassness in a man whose fol-
lowers have labored to raise him
up as a monument of hope,
morality and compassion.”
And, speaking of monuments,
Pegler challenges: “Name an-
other American who was so well
convinced of his political im-
mortality that he built a
memorial to himself! ” As with
practically all the attackers,
Roosevelt’s chief fault, in Peg-
ler’s view, was his something
more than confidence in Stalin:
“All experience shrieked that
Stalin was no better than Hitler,
that the Muscovites had Roose-
velt pegged for a silly snob and
that they laughed at his con-
fidence in their word.”
N. Y. “Daily Mirror” editorial
comment can be listed as an-
other typical example in the
Pegler class; “Why did he [then
Secretary of State Byrnes] not
cry out at Yalta; ‘You cannot
imperil my country —not with
me as witness!’ He did not do
that. Nobody did that. They
all gathered together to save the
face and political future of a
President who did not know
what he was doing and who
hoped his ‘grand design’ would
work out, much as a gambler
hopes his system will work out.”
The “Daily Mirror” must have
read Byrnes in hop-step-and-
jump style; one of the hard
points Byrnes makes in his book
regarding Yalta is that Roose-
velt’s sell-out to Stalin there hap-
pened after Byrnes had left;
Stalin having pressed Roosevelt
to stay another day, and Roose-
velt, when he returned to Wash-
ington, not telling his Secretary
of State of the secret deal that
had been made. Though he
should normally have been the
first told, Byrnes knew nothing
of it till after Roosevelt’s death.
That secret deal has been de-
scribed, jn what adds up to a
particularly trenchant criticism
of Roosevelt, by one of
America’s leading pre-war and
war-time diplomats, William C,
Bullitt, in a “Life” article:
At Yalta, on Feb. 11, 1945, President
Roosevelt signed, with Marshal Stalin
and . Prime Minister Churchill, sec-
retly, behind the back of China, an
agreement by which vital rights of
China in her province of Manchuria
were sacrificed to Soviet imperialism.
No more unnecessary, disgraceful and
potentially disastrous document has
ever been signed by a President of
the U.S. Unnecessary, because at a
time when it was obvious that no
power on earth could prevent Stalin
from declaring war on Japan at the
last minute, we bought his entry into
the war at the expense of a major
injury to our ally China. Disgraceful,
because all the weasel words in the
world cannot convince any fairminded
man that we kept our Cairo pledge
to China. Potentially disastrous, be-
cause we handed to Stalin a deadly
instrument for the domination of
China and thereby paved the way for
war in the Far East.
In a biography of himself,
written with his collaboration
and running currently in the
“Ladies’ Home Journal,” former
U.S. Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson speaks of Roosevelt’s
“constant effort to keep all the
threads in his own hands: one
man simply could not do it all
and Franklin Roosevelt killed
himself trying.” Stimson be-
lieves that Theodore Roosevelt
would have provided better
leadership in the, period before
Pearl Harbor:
T.R.’s advantage would have been
in his natural boldness, his firm con-
viction that where he led, men would
follow. He would have been able to
brush aside the contemptible little
group of men who wailed of “war-
mongers,” and in the blunt strokes
of a poster-painter he would have
demonstrated the duty of Americans.
Franklin D. Roosevelt was not
made that way. With unequalled
political skill he could pave the way
for any given specific step, but in
so doing he was likely to tie his own
hands for the future, using honeyed
and consoling words that would re-
turn to plague him later.
The temperate Arthur Krock
—N. Y. “Times” Washington
authority—joins in on an in-
teresting point, commenting on
claims that Roosevelt was
“highly critical of any agree-
ment he thought the ‘slippery’
Neville Chamberlain was likely to
make” at Munich. Krock men-
tions Roosevelt having asked
everyone on “the following Sun-
day [after Munich] to pray for
continued peace” and quotes the
report from Washington at that
time: “The greatest gratification
was evident here over the peace-
ful outcome of the Munich con-
ference.” And, finally, Krock
refers to “the congratulatory
telegram which Mr. Roosevelt
was said to have sent to Prime
Minister Chamberlain.”
Most of the writings about
Roosevelt, hostile or friendly,
have some reference to his
“Dutch stubbornness.” As a
matter of historical accuracy,
the writer of a friendly article
on him in “Life” declares: “The
fact is that Roosevelt was almost
90 per cent. English and only
about 3 per cent. Dutch.”
Justice Webb’s Recall.
Chicago “Tribune” took a
very poor view of the recalling
temporarily of Mr. Justice Webb
from the Jap war-crimes trial.
Criticising the protracted
“judicial marathon” as making
“the Nuremberg trial of Ger-
man leaders, which lasted 10
months and 10 days, look like a
sprint,” and commenting that
“the very duration of the [Jap]
trial reduces the proceedings to
a farce,” the “Tribune” edi-
torially hit hard at the recall;
The record had reached page 32,663
on Nov. 14, with nobody knows how
many more thousands of pages of
exhibits, when Sir William Webb, of
Australia, the presiding Justice of the
11-nation Court, introduced a new
twist in the accepted code of judicial
conduct. Webb announced that he
had received a cable from the Prime
Minister of Australia, requesting him
to return for the November sittings
of the High Court of Australia, of
which he is a member.
“The November sittings commence
on Tuesday next and will continue
until the 20th of December,” Webb
stated. “I am returning to Australia.”
Webb thus proposed to absent him-
self from his post as presiding Judge
for more than a month just when the
defence was reaching the heart of the
proceedings
It is a fundamental right of the
accused to be faced by the Judge who
is to pass sentence on him at all
times during the proceedings and
especially when he gives his own
testimony, but Justice Webb did not
regard this as a compelling duty.
Owen Cunningham, of Des Moines,
counsel for Hiroshi Oshima, former
Japanese Ambassador to Germany,
argued that Webb’s decision to walk
out on the trial confronted Webb,
as president of the Court, with these
choices; That the Court be adjourned
during his absence, that he disqualify
himself from further participation in
the trial and permit Gen. MacArthur
to designate a successor, or that the
case be dismissed and “we all go back
to our own countries.”
Asserting that the privilege of
absence had been abused by other
Judges during the trial, Cunningham
said “It is my contention that no
Judge should hold down two Judge-
ships at the same time or positions
on different Courts at the same time.”
Webb responded that the charter con-
stituting the Court expressly permitted
Judges to be absent, whereupon Cun-
ningham rejoined “The charter never
contemplated a trial by absent
Judges.”
Webb did not hold with Cunning-
ham’s views, and, when Cunningham
called upon him to cite legal authority
for his position, the presiding Judge
brushed aside the demand with the
observation “Some things are so
elementary that authority is not called
for.” In other words, he took the
position that, with authority to vote
hanging for all of the defendants,
he need not even listen to the evi-
dence to arrive at his determination
in the case.
“Since this case,” Cunningham
continued, “involves the question —
‘Do international obligations super-
sede national obligations?’—it seems
that the president of the Court should
decide which duty calls him; but both
should not be allowed to call him at
the same time.” He suggested that
Australia should make its sacrifice
to the cause of justice by waiving
Webb’s services until his present
assignment is concluded.
“It is not for you to tell Australia
what her duty is, nor for me to listen
to you,” Webb replied.
After further particulars of
the clash between Cunningham
and Webb, L, the “Tribune”
wound up with the comment;
“Here are the Allies, professedly
trying to acquaint the Japanese
with ‘democracy’ and to incuL
cate in them respect for law,
while themselves violating the
most elementary requirements
of fair trial wkh absentee Judges
and mail-order justice.”
Wallace v. Truman.
Cables presented the an-
nouncement of Henry A. Wal-
lace’s U.S. Presidential candidacy
as practically meaning that Mr.
Truman would be a cooked
goose next November.
The Republican chairman was
quoted: “I think Mr. Wallace’s
candidacy assures. that Mr.
Truman will be defeated and a
Republican elected in 1948.”
Also the publication “PM”:
“With Wallace’s candidacy only
a political miracle will prevent
Mr. Dewey or Mr. Taft from
being President of the United
States a year from now.”
A very different assessment
has been made by one of the
most careful of American
political journalists —N. Y.
“Times’s” Washington onlooker
Arthur Krock. Not given to
getting himself out on limbs,
Krock reports Mr. Truman as
not regarding the Wallace in-
trusion as a serious threat.
Among reasons for Mr. Tru-
man’s calmness Krock states:
The President knows Mr. Wallace
and he knows his record. In neither
is there much testimony that the new
candidate is a man who will fight
to the end along a straight course
to a stated destination. Mr. Wallace
has changed his mind and gone back
on his commitments often. And it
should be noted that, in a press
conference, Mr. Wallace said he
would withdraw “should either of the
major parties become definitely a
peace party before the election.”
Krock sees that as leaving the
way open to Mr. Wallace to
declare either side a “peace
party” any time between now
and November, and hence be
able to “base withdrawal on con-
viction or expediency, and ex-
pedient decisions occur fre-
quently in his public record.”
After analysing various com-
plexities of the American poli-
tical scene to show that Mr,
Wallace’s candidacy need not
necessarily be a Republican
advantage and could prove a
disadvantage to that party,
Krock adds:
The President also may have in
mind the fact that at any time Mr.
Wallace’s silent partner, however un-
welcome in the firm, can remove
whatever appeal his candidacy may*
have among citizens to whom there
is magic in the Wallace voice and
the word “peace”; and who fear that
our foreign policy is accelerating the
prospect of a war with Soviet Russia.
This silent partner, the Politburo in
the Kremlin, now the captive of its
own propaganda against the West,
any day may find it necessary for
political self-preservation to make a
move or a series of moves that will
subtract from Mr. Wallace’s potential
following all but the Communists and
the fellow-travellers. Mr. Truman
must also realise that there are con-
ceivable steps by the Kremlin which
would frighten Mr. Wallace into with-
drawal under the lash of outraged
public opinion.
On all counts, Krock con-
cludes that the greatest prob-
ability is that Mr. Wallace’s entry
“will not have a decisive effect
on the Presidential choice or on
national policy... .and that he
will not finish the race.”
Moscow Deflation.
The Soviet currency manipu-
lation, as viewed by G. L.
Schwartz in London “Sunday
Times”;
The Russians [in December] effected
a drastic amputation of currency and
credit. Notes in circulation are to
be exchanged on the basis of one
new rouble for 10 old. Bank deposits
up to 3000 roubles will be exchanged
at par, the next 7000 in the ratio of
two new to three old, and above
10,000 in the ratio of one for two.
Investments in State loans are to be
written down by two-thirds. At the
same time rationing is to be abolished.
The significance for us of the
measure lies not so much in the
harshness and inequity of the measure
as in its principle. It is an act of
deflation. As the Soviet authorities
explained, there was much more
money in circulation than was needed
for the national economy. The
remedy was to eliminate the excess,
whereupon the free market could be
restored. •
Now it has been unsafe to argue
on these lines in this country [Britain]
for the last two years, on the risk
of being certified as a criminal lunatic.
The word deflation has become
anathema, and the term and concept
have almost passed out of circulation.
It is significant that many commen-
tators here described 'the Russian
measure as one of devaluation. It is
just the opposite of that: it is de-
flation ....
“Intellectually wrong and morally
reprehensible.” Such was the official
Left condemnation of the policy of
deflation. And now the boys in the
back room of the Ministry of Finance
in Moscow have coolly endorsed it as
the logical method of restoring
equilibrium. Deflate purchasing
power and restore the free market.
The Western world, including the
United States, still funks the issue.
The existence of excess purchasing
power is acknowledged, and the cure
is sought in a mixture of cajolery,
bluff and controls. The Soviet method
is brutal and discriminatory, and
more equitable methods of deflation
are at our disposal, but the longer
we shirk it the more painful and
inequitable the process will be.
Now that the Order of the Red
Star has been conferred upon de-
flation we may see greater use of the
instrument of finance made here. If
so, prepare for a grand mopping-up
budget next April. And if it comes,
do not attribute it to the promptings
of hard-faced bankers and money
barons enthroned upon their seats of
gold. Give credit where credit is
due. Let Joe have it.
[lncidentally, regarding the abolish-
ing of rationing mentioned in the
foregoing article, “World Report”
states: “The Russians are not quite
through with rationing, after all.
Control by shopkeepers, it now
appears, replaces control by ration
coupons. Retailers are authorised by
the Government to limit sales, even
of food and clothing, to make stocks
last. It’s ‘one to a customer’ again.
Only difference is that now merchants
do the rationing—under Government
inspection and control. High prices,
two or three times the ration prices
of 1946, add another obstacle for
consumers. Price, as in capitalistic
countries, does some rationing.
Moscow fanfare on the end of ration-
ing may have been somewhat pre-
mature.”]
Greece No Spain.
On the formation of the
Markos Communist “Govern-
ment” in Northern Greece it was
freely suggested in cables that
Greece would soon become
“another Spain” ; the local war
turning into a battleground for
all.
N. Y. “Times’s” chief Euro-
pean correspondent, C. L. Sulz-
berger, has cast doubts on that
assumption, his optimism based
chiefly on the ground that “Mos-
cow not only does not want war
—nobody does —but does not
dare risk it.” The main issues:,
Behind Markos are the Communist
bases of Albania, Yugoslavia and
Bulgaria. Behind them is the citadel
of world Communism Moscow.
Behind Markos are Albanian terri-
torial aspirations for Epirus, Yugo-
slav territorial aspirations for Mace-
donia, Bulgarian territorial aspirations
for Thrace.
Behind all these are Russian terri-
torial aspirations for an outlet to
the Mediterranean, for control of the
Aegean, for domination of the
Bosporus and Dardanelles. Greece,
with its immense coastline and its
strategically situated islands Crete,
the Dodecanese, Samothrace, Imbros,
Lemnos, Corfu has enormous
strategic significance.
Despite that background, the
correspondent expects the situa-
tion in Greece to cool “when
Moscow sees its game is
checked.” His view is that the
“Markos venture was a trial bal-
loon,” liable to deflation by
strong U.S. reaction. With that
reaction—expressed by the U.S.
Navy force appearing round
about Greece and the increasing
of U.S. strength in Greece itself
—the Greek situation should be
“stabilised without war after a
few difficult months,” on which
“Soviet pressure will be shifted
westward and to the Far East.”
Dragnet Digest.
Canada’s Big Part. —Canada’s huge-
scale war effort staggered everybody;
N. Y. “World-Telegram” points out
that it still goes on; “While there is
much discussion of the United States’
aid to Europe, not so much attention
has been given to what Canada has
done. Canada has loaned a total of
$1,850,000,000 to European countries.
In terms of relative population that
is equivalent to a United States out-
lay of $20,350,000,000. In terms of
national income, it is roughly equiva-
lent to an American outlay of
$27,750,000,000. To the world’s need
in war or peace, Canada makes a
bold and sacrificial contribution. But
she does it quietly, without fanfare.”

“Marvellous Gall.” For anyone
clinging to the idea that U.S.-British
negotiators haven’t been patient
enough with Russia, an example re-
ported from Vienna by N. Y. “Herald
Tribune” correspondent Joseph
Alsop: “Totally incredible as it may
seem, the Soviets blandly announced,
in the fruitless meetings of the Aus-
trian Treaty Commission, that they
were the owners of Austrian roads.
The Nazis had constructed auto-
bahnen in Austria after the Anschluss.
The Soviet negotiator, Novikov, had
the marvellous gall to claim that both
these roads and the land underlying
them belonged to the Soviet Union.
By the same token he laid claim to
a number of public buildings. But
as a gesture of infinite generosity, he
offered to trade off these roads and
buildings against stock in industrial
plants which even the Soviets could
not call German.”

Indonesians and Dutch.— Maj.-Gen.
David P. Barrows, in N. Y. “Journal-
American,” sums up on the Dutch
and Indonesians rather differently
from the “policy”-makers at Can-
berra : “The accounts of the Dutch
and the Indonesians do not agree,.
This does not justify according
superior weight to the native outcry.
These are new and unknown leaders;
they are known to have co-operated
with the Japanese; their moral re-
liability is unproven. On the other
hand, the Dutch are one of the most
fully-tested peoples of Europe. Their
reputation for honesty is second to
none. They have offered a complete
change of policy respecting colonial
possessions, but it should not be
considered that their work and re-
sponsibility in the colonial field should
abruptly terminate. If it does, native
government will almost certainly fail.
Civilisation will revert toward bar-
barism. The economic resources of
this rich archipelago will wither.”

Rolls-Royce Competition. —Hartfort
“Courant” on a line of trade not
altogether peculiar to the U.S.: “In
New York the Rolls-Royce is back
and available for on-the-spot delivery
at $19,000. It remains to be seen how
the used-car boys will view this new
competition.”

Farmers’ Co-operatives. —An official
U.S. publication gives three out of
every five American farmers as be-
longing to “cb-operatives.” It adds
that more than $4,000,000,000-worth
of farm products are marketed
annually by co-operatives, and another
billion dollars-worth of seeds, fer-
tilisers and other supplies are pur-
chased by farmers through them.
Since 1935 some 1,700,000 farmers
have been supplied with electricity
through more than 900 rural electri-
fication co-operatives. The first co-
operative hospital in the U.S. was
organised by farmers. While the
main strength of co-operatives in the
U.S. still lies in marketing and pur-
chasing, a wide variety of new ser-
vices, such as housing, automobile
repair and maintenance, cafeterias,
family cold-storage lockers, and
medical and hospital care, are “prov-
ing increasingly adaptable to co-
operative enterprise in both urban
and rural districts.”

NATION OR SLAVE CAMP?
Australia is not yet a Communist
police State, but it is travelling that way.
It has a party in power with an objec-
tive designed by a committee on which
were the then head of the Communists —
he described himself as consul for the
U.S.S.R.—and two men who became
“Labor” Prime Ministers. And the means
for reaching that objective have mostly
been devised or developed by Com-
munist union leaders —industrialisation
of the unions, with use of “key” men for
blackmailing; introduction of drastic
measures of “nationalisation”; per-
manent exercise of powers taken in war-
time ; and regulation of every phase of
private life and enterprise, in particular
by control of house property, income and
savings. Income is struck at by brutal
taxation, the fruits of which are used for
political bribery of the less-worthy sec-
tions of the community and the accom-
modation of great and growing masses
of Government employees.
It has become recognised in the party
philosophy that no man who does not
support “Labor” has any right to con-
sideration. On the other hand the com-
missar, once elected on a “Labor” ticket,
has a billet for life. Election as a
“Labor” member is no longer election
for three years. It is election to per-
manent ease. A Minister who made him-
self a laughing-stock, whose “call for a
report” has become standard American
as well as Australian Army slang, is,
when defeated at the polls, appointed to
a richly-endowed High Commissioner-
ship. An associate of Communists,
thrown out of the House largely because
he falsely accused the father of an only
son —killed on the Kokoda Trail, after
brilliant fighting service in the Middle
East —of sharing in the profits of a -
house of assignation, is appointed to an
office in which he will be able to learn
secrets of value to the defence of the
country.
The ideas behind this sort of thing
were imported into the party by Com-
munists and crypto-Communists, to whose
beliefs a “Labor” Minister impiously
applied the term Christlike. They have
penetrated so far that not many steps
will be needed, short of an ultimate burst
of violence, to bring methods of govern-
ment in the Commonwealth into line with
those of countries governed by men who
authorised Australian Communism and
who operate under Communist systems.
Three of these mentors of Australian
Communism and of the ideas with which
Australian “Labor” policy are now very
much in line are in the public eye in
Europe. One is Rakosi, who is ruling
Hungary for the Kremlin, with political
machinery consisting mainly of a rope
and a firing squad. He it was who an-
nounced by cable to the Australian Com-
munist party its admission to the Com-
munist International. The second is
Kolarow, director of policies affecting
the British Dominions in the' Foreign
Office of the U.S.S.R. It was Kolarow
who issued the Australian Communist
party’s charter and accepted in return
its pledges, one of which bound it to
“dispense with avowed patriotism and
also with dishonest an,d hypocritical
pacifism” and demonstrate to the workers
the need for violent revolution.
The third is Dmitrov, instructor for
years of the Australian Communist party,
and after whom it named its official press.
Dmitrov wrote for it its war-time bible —
scrapped when Hitler double-crossed his
friend Stalin —in which it demanded that
the workers should force the Common-
wealth Government to make a shameful
peace with Hitler. This ruffian has done to
death the leader of the Opposition in his
country and threatens survivors with the
same fate. He appears to be emerging
not merely as the Russian-appointed
master of Bulgaria but as the Russian
Governor-General of all the Russian-
conquered countries of Europe. In one,
Poland, he was the official Kremlin
satrap when that tragic republic was
divided between the totalitarian im-
perialists of Moscow and Berlin.
By the instruments of these men and
their cringing associates of the “Labor”
party, Australia has been dragged far
along the road to serfdom. Even in Mos-
cow the ordinary citizen is scarcely more
subjected to spying and control by
officials. The Taxation and Prices De-
partments snoop into every corner of
private life. Privately-grown produce is
no longer private property. This was
demonstrated when 18,000,000 bushels of
wheat, every bit of grain commandeered,
was sold to “Labor” New Zealand at ss.
9d. when the fair export price was 16s.
and rising to £l, and higher still.
The small private trader looks warily
at every stranger who enters his place
of business, never being sure whether he
or she is not an agent provocateur. A
few women cannot meet together to form
a political organisation without being in-
terrogated by the police. And to the ordi-
nary civil police there has been added a
vast and increasing body of Common-
wealth “security officers” who investigate
such matters as the origin of anti-Com-
munist slogans chalked on walls, and whose
commanders are high-ranking military
officers. Free postal communication with
other parts of the British Commonwealth
is threatened. The operation of the law
of supply and demand on an open market
has virtually been abolished. Parliament
has become a mere registering-machine
for a secret junta or juntas. And
“justice” so operates that the small shop-
keeper who overcharges in a petty way
is pursued relentlessly while huge black-
markets in liquor, in cars and in real
estate are carried on with impunity and
have become a national disgrace.
Upon every phase of Australian life
the brand of totalitarianism has fallen,
and not least upon individual freedom.
The Canberra “Government’s” attitude of
mind is shown by its demand that Aus-
tralian girls and others employed by the
United States authorities, in Japan and
other countries, should instantly return to
Australia and hand over their small dollar
savings for conversion into pounds, shil-
lings and pence. Its action in this matter
forms a striking parallel to that of the
Communist Government of Yugoslavia,
which has ordered all Yugoslavs in Aus-
tralia who are likely to be useful, irre-
spective of nationality, to return immedi-
ately to Yugoslavia with their movable
assets otherwise their relatives will be
made to suffer. The “Labor” Govern-
ment has not gone that far, but the under-
lying principle is the same.
The Australians concerned were per-
mitted to leave the country only after
complying with drastic formalities and
agreeing to pay Australian income tax
during their absence. Though they are
adult, “free,” white and twenty-one, they
are now ordered to come home and
threatened that if they “defy the order”
they will be left without credentials.
Even now some have no passports, merely
“exit permits.”
The Government has no means by
which it can force the girls to return.
But in the event of “disobedience” it is
prepared to deprive them of their Aus-
tralian nationality and leave them
stranded in an enemy country. Oriental
at that—a cruel and barbarous threat,
worthy not of a free English-speaking
nation but of a Slav Slave State.
Drongo-bird in Java.
Our Foreign Policy, which has so often
“changed its plumage in mid-flight,” has
become a bird of ill-omen in the near-
Australian air. What it amounts to in
the wider skies of U.N.0., after Dr.
Evatt’s chairmanship of the Palestine
Committee charged to provide for peace
in that country after the British leave,
may be judged from the Jewish-Arab
war now rapidly steaming up.
Our Foreign Policy in Java opposed
that of Britain and America and played
up to that of Russia —as it tended to do
also in Japan until the change of plum-
age occurred. Two senior members of the
new Evatt school of diplomacy resigned
in disgust, and now the dux of them all,
Colonel Hodgson, is coming home —“for
consultations.”
On the economic side Our Foreign
Policy has prevented any revival of the
once-flourishing Australian trade with
the N.E.I. Since 1945 the waterfront
unions, which the Chifley Government
has allowed to mould and interpret our
relations with Indonesia, have banned
that trade and still ban it. Before the
middle of last year the loss was put by
spokesmen for Australian merchant
houses at something like £3O millions’
worth, and that will have grown since.
The raw materials and fuel from the
Netherlands East Indies which the whole
world sorely needs are about the best
doliar-earners currently listed, and Aus-
tralia could have had a fine share of that
business. The Australian “Government”
has deliberately sacrificed the oppor-
tunity because the Communist - run
unions declared it “black” and Mr.
Chifley refused “to crucify the workers'.”
Whether interpreted by these unions
or by Dr, Evatt, Our Foreign Policy has
antagonised America and embittered the
Dutch, become the scoff of Moscow and
made us look fools at U.N.O. head-
quarters. Its only constancy so far seems
to have been in pursuing the idea of
codifying in statutory form some defini-
tion of “human rights”—-an obsession of
Dr. Evatt’s at U.N.0., which, it may be
remarked, is violated in every socialistic
move of Dr. Evatt’s “Government” at
home here in Australia. What “human
rights” in this “Labor”-ridden com-
munity have non-unionists, minorities of
any sort, traders who want to expand
their business or young women who
undertake work for our American allies
and have earned a few dollars for them-
selves (the latest crime a citizen can
commit) in the process? Canberra is
very keen on a “free vote” to determine
regional status in Java, but the idea of
a secret ballot in any militant Australian
union before its executive orders a strike
against the community is anathema to
every member of the Cabinet,
To ram home its failure Our Foreign
Policy, “larrikin strain” and all, let down
its own friends. What the disil-
lusioned Dr. Sjahrir said about his recep-
tion in Australia after his unobtrusive
“goodwill mission” in December must
have scorched a bit more earth in the
already well-scorched mid-Java regions.
Wharfies and seamen, it seemed, did not
want any goodwill, and Mr, Chifley and
Dr. Evatt were otherwise occupied in try-
ing to ensnare Dr. van Beel, the Nether-
lands Premier, to visit them in Canberra
on his way home —for the sake of what
they called goodwill. Dr. van Beel,
through a secretary, replied to the invi-
tation that his time was much too
precious. As the Communists of the
Waterside Workers’ Federation were
making it clear that they would not per-
mit trade with, the N.E.I. to be restored,
what was the use of his coming to Aus-
tralia to talk with Ministers who yield to
these Communists at every point?
Dr. van Beel had, in fact, pulled off
the game which the Dutch had been
patiently playing in Indonesia in defiance
of all outside busybodies—which, as they
conveyed in polite language, went for
U.N.0., too. They had the support of
the United States Government, together
with the sympathy of the British Govern-
ment, and that was all they wanted. The
cease-fire agreement which the much-
reduced “Republicans” have been obliged
to sign is claimed by the Australian dele-
gate to the Good Offices Committee of
three as a signal of success for that body.
This ought to raise some wide-ranging
ribald laughter considering that:
It is the Australian member who says
so, representing as he does the Evatt
Foreign Policy bird, which, launched as a
dove of peace, after rambling about as
some kind of an anti-homing pigeon,
tumbled to earth looking like a more-than-
usually-stupid owl.
The G.O.C. (not to be confused with
anything savoring of command) was not
the intervening body that Australia tried
to get at U.N.0., was not an arbitrator,
and was virtually disowned long ago by
Mr. Chifley as anything worthy of his
interest.
Whereas the Australian “Government’s”
effort was directed to aid the “Indernesian
comrades” against the Dutch, to nullify
the Dutch police operations of July and
August and to support the untenable claim
of the Japanese-established minority to be
an independent “Government,” the result
now brought about justifies the whole ,
Dutch stand and has created a basis for
the United States of Indonesia (as con-
ceived in the Cheribon agreement), in which
ten other Indonesian States should well
outweigh the “republic’s” political influence
in the federation.
What Mr. Chifley intended when he
referred the Indonesian situation formally
to the Security Council on July 30 was
that U.N.O. should provide an arbitrator
whose decision should be binding on
both parties. It would be enforced by
economic sanctions if necessary. He sug-
gested this from Australia as an impartial
neutral —when already his “Government”
had allowed economic sanctions to be
imposed in the name of Australia by
the bosses of the Waterside Workers’
Federation. What annoyed Mr. Chifley,
as it annoyed the Communists, was that
the Dutch, weary of the rebels’ procras-
tination over releasing Dutch and other
citizens interned by either the Japanese
or the Indonesians, and over the restora-
tion of Dutch plantations and mills, took
swift and resolute action, which has
proved effective.
Apart from these considerations. Our
Foreign Policy was showing its usual
waywardness in submitting the matter to
the Security Council at all, for Dr. Evatt
had already described such a process as
futile. “The Security Council,” he had
said a few months earlier, “is in this
appalling position, that nothing can be
done about a dispute that comes before
it —from the beginning you know that
nothing can be done about it.” When the
Australian motion (with which India was
associated) did come on it was watered
down by an amendment from the Ameri-
can delegate calling on both parties to
cease fire and settle their dispute by peace-
ful means. He offered America’s good
offices to this end; and to a Good
Offices Commission of three Holland then
nominated Belgium and Indonesia nomi-
nated Australia. That knocked out any
further pretence of Australian imparti-
ality, as Mr. Chifley’s observations from
Canberra testified. He had wanted, he
said, an arbitration decision which should
be final: “any offer of mere good offices
.is not adequate.” Later Dr. Evatt also
thought it “a great pity.”
The G.O. Commission did not arrive
in Batavia till early-Novefnber, and the
“cease fire” has only now been arranged.
For most of two months after the de-
cision to send the commission the
Security Council bandied about inci-
dental questions. In early August Russia
had moved (vainly) that the forces of
both parties should be withdrawn to
positions occupied before operations be-
gan. Colonel Hodgson, for Australia,
opposed, saying “this matter has given
my Government more worry than any-
thing else, but it was finally decided not
to include it in the motion.” The Rus-
sians renewed the motion in October,
and to the astonishment of everybody at
Lake Success Colonel Hodgson then
“suddenly declared for it.” No doubt
this reflected Mr. Chifley’s dissatisfaction
with “good offices” as a cure.
In the upshot the independent, pro-
Communist Indonesian “Republic,” for
which Mr. Chifley was prepared to com-
mit Australia to formal adoption of
economic sanctions against the Dutch, in
which his “Government” has acquiesced
since September, 1945, has been ex-
posed for the vamped-up Moscow-
serving minority in Java that all
well-informed people knew it to be.
The Dutch have recovered the vital
plantations in east and west Java
and in north-eastern Sumatra over which
these rebels had asserted their reign of
terror, and exports should soon be pos-
sible again. The Dutch Premier has com-
pleted arrangements for the federation
of the N.E.1., to which the “republican”
rump in Java may now adhere or not, as
it wishes, without causing much harm
either way. Indeed, the “republic” has
lost so much “face” and territory that
British observers on the spot believe it is
unlikely to last another six months. Its
“cabinet” has now resigned, but not, of
course, dictator Soekarno.
Judge Kirby, Mr. Chifley’s delegate on
the G.0.C., is going to Lake Success with
the Belgian and the American members'.
Of course those Arbitration Court duties
of his about which Mr, Chifley developed
concern some weeks ago may supervene.
And it might occur to Judge Kirby to ask
Canberra again (if he ever did ask be-
fore) when the results of his earlier
Javanese peregrinations, respecting the
murder in 1946 of three Australian
officers of the War Crimes unit, is likely
to be published by the “Government”
that commissioned him to undertake an
inquiry and prepare a report—as he did.
The officers butchered by “our Inder-
nesian comrades” or by Japanese wearing
their motley uniform have not been for-
gotten by their families and comrades,
however much “Labor” may choose to
forget.
Ebery.
Victoria’s modest seer:
S. H. Ebery, who has a meteorological station
at Black Rock, on the shores of Port Phillip,
whence he issues seasonal forecasts to sub-
scribers, has been out of the news lately. Dur-
ing the long drought, which he predicted, he
was much in the news. Even Cabinet Ministers
took an interest in his apparent ability to say
what the weather would be three months hence.
The State Government found that he had
been 80 p.c. correct in his predictions over a
long period, and Mr. Dedman gave his depart-
ments instructions to facilitate the Ebery re-
searches by supplying upper-air data.
With the return of a flush season Ebery has
been forgotten, just as, when the grass is green,
bushfires are forgotten. But, while Ministers
of Agriculture like Mr. Pollard were issuing
optimistic estimates of the wheat harvest, Ebery
was sending out forecasts of abnormal weather.
That issued on December 1 is an almost
uncannily accurate prediction of the cyclonic
conditions, the heavy rains and the gales, that
scoured the southern half of N. S. Wales,
the east of South Australia and the whole of
Victoria and Tasmania and made people wonder
if the atomic bomb at Bikini had upset the
balance of Nature.
Ebery is not an astrologer, a teacup-reader
or a professional meteorologist. He was a
plain farmer, born with a scientific bent. At
12 he became so interested in the phenomena
of Nature that he used to improvise barometers
and other gadgets out of grass-seeds. With
E. T. Quayle, 8.A., whom he regards as one
of Australia’s most outstanding meteorologists,
he tried to find a way of forecasting the
weather, not from day to day, but in its
great seasonal variations. Quayle, much to his
regret, went the way of sunspots, but Ebery
stuck to his upper-air investigations. He doesn’t
think that either sunspots or Antarctic expedi-
tions will solve the problem, but believes that
it can be solved within Australia’s own boun-
daries if and when a sufficient number of
trained and truly enthusiastic cirrus-cloud
observers are placed at strategic points to obtain
and dispatch data.
In a recent broadcast he offered thanks to
The Bulletin for “its fine efforts to secure
iome enthusiasts in this highly important field.”
At present he has to rely on a handful of
voluntary observers —one in Victoria, one in
N. S. Wales and three in Queensland. Between
20 and 30 are required, and apparently they
can’t be obtained except by Governmental
assistance. The cost to the nation would be
a minor item in the estimated expenditure of
£750,000 on meteorological services for the
current financial year, the results of which will
still leave the farmer at the mercy of the sky
god.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Ward in the Box.
Hearing of evidence in the Garden case
began in the Special Court, Sydney, last
Wednesday, and was proceeding when
this issue went to press.
Garden was “liaison officer” to E. J.
Ward when that Minister of Transport
and External Territories-was in control
of Labor and National Service, October
7, 1941, to September 21, 1943. He con-
tinued as such under E. J. Holloway, and,
till his exit last month, continued to have
the entree to the Ward office in the Com-
monwealth Bank Building, to which his
own office was handy. Thus he was a
Holloway “liaison officer” during the
period covered by the three charges
against him, which are that he forged
documents and falsified a letter and a
plan, all relating to a non-existent Ex-
ternal Territories concession to Ray Parer
for the milling and export of Bulolo
Valley timber, “a valuable stand of pine
and cedar.”
The Crown alleges moreover that
Garden, his son Harcourt, one Edward
Farrell (“of Epping”) and Parer were
members of a syndicate which entered
into an agreement to sell “the rights” to
Hancock and Gore, an old Queensland
firm of timber merchants, and received
half the purchase money, £lOO,OOO, in
two amounts of £12,500 and £37,500. To
a detective-inspector, according to his
testimony, Garden admitted having re-
ceived £4500, “the total amount due to
him,” and having “placed the Minister”
(Ward) “in a very embarrassing position
by signing his name to a document pur-
porting to have come from the Minister”
(Ward).
Told by the Minister (Ward), who de-
nied all knowledge of the syndicate,
while admitting that Garden had spoken
to him about “Parer’s application” on
“innumerable occasions',” that he must
refer the matter to Commonwealth In-
vestigation, Garden said “If you do I’m
a goner!” The detective-inspector had
asked Garden whether he had thought
he could get the concession for Parer
by “paying money” to Ward. “Not
possible,” Garden replied:
Nobody could offer him anything under
any circumstances, not even a postage-
stamp.
This in no way prepared the crowded
Court for the line of cross-examination
taken by Garden’s counsel (Simon Isaacs)
when the Minister (Ward) was in the
box, nor was the Minister found in the
mood in which the sentimental drawing-
room tenor sings “I Know a Lovely
Garden.” It began with counsel asking
whether it wasn’t “just plain humbug” of
witness to “deny any knowledge of the
syndicate,” and “weren’t you in this trans-
action up to your neck?” “No, you’re a
liar,” witness replied.
Wasn’t your share twenty thousand? —
You dirty liar; no!
You were to receive five thousand out of
the first fifty thousand, and the other twenty
thousand out of the balance? —I know
nothing about it. I took the proper
course and informed the Commonwealth
Investigation Branch.
Will you deny that five thousand in ten-
pound notes was produced in your office?
—You are a liar!
You told the person producing it to
take it to Bill Urquhart and he would
know what to do with it? —No, you dirty
liar!
Here the magistrate intervened with
“Mr. Ward, please answer the questions
yes or no,” and the eruption of objurga-
tions ceased. But. not the cross-examina-
tion :
Witness did not tell Garden that he himself
had his “corner” all right and that “the five
grand” had been delivered to Urquhart
and was going into witness’s safe deposit.
Urquhart was a National Security officer
in 1945 and a constant visitor to witness’s
house “to attend to/ the requirements of
my constituency.” Witness had in 1946
recommended Urquhart’s appointment as
managing director of the Sydney Pincombe
Proprietary [a typewriter agency in a pretty
big way of business] but had no shares
in it nor any investments save a few
Commonwealth bonds. Nor had his wife
ever won £ll,OOO at the races or told any-
one she had. Nor had he got £6OOO out
of a New Caledonia transaction with the late
“Mossie” Hyams, “a friend of mine and
a member of the Labor party.” [“Mossie”
was also, in the old do’ and Sunday
“carnival” businesses and on the fringe of
the racing game.] “Mossie” had asked
him to expedite “Mossie’s” visit to New
Caledonia. Witness had a current savings
account in the Commonwealth Bank, a
safe at his office and a safe deposit at
the Bank of New South Wales in the
name of himself and Mrs. Ward.
Counsel: It has been established that
£37,500 was paid to Farrell on November
26, 1945. You made a personal visit to
your safe deposit on January 4, 1946?
I can’t remember the exact date,
i A safe deposit is a very convenient place
to keep a big sum of money?—lt is for
disreputable people; but I am not one
of that class. You may be.
Mention of the safe deposit “at the Bank
of New South Wales” brought a gale of
laughter. It was “sternly suppressed.”
Blackmail and Scare.
Mr. Hanlon is a singular fellow.
Singular in that he was the first returned
soldier to become head of a “Labor”
Government, and in that his “Labor”
Government, with all its faults, is no
squib Government.
Last year Mr. Hanlon refused to be
coerced by the Miners’ Federation and
Mr. Chifley into handing over Queens-
land’s coalmining industry, with its fair
promise of greatness, to the Joint (Com-
monwealth-N.S.W.) Coal Board on a
basis of permanent minority representa-
tion for Queensland. Thereby he served
his people well, and when North Queens-
land gets its own State his action will be
remembered with respect. By standing
out of the Joint Coal Board outfit, and
by going ahead with the Blair Athol
undertaking, facing down union threats,
he saved Queensland from being dragged
into the latest criminal N.S.W. coalfields
strike.
That was started by the Federated
Engine-drivers and Firemen in repudia-
tion of a Central Coal Reference Board
award for which they had asked, and in
contempt of a statement by the chair-
man, Mr. Gallagher, who had been trans-
ferred to the Reference Board to meet
their “wishes,” that its operation would
be suspended if they threw the mines
idle by holding “stopwork meetings.”
This they did, with the drearily familiar
consequences—no coal; gas and trans-
port restrictions ; savage threats to house-
holders boiling the kettle in prohibited
times, and preparations for closing down
industries on a vast scale. All this as a
sequel to a week otpoor production, for
which the Miners’ Federation, fresh from
three weeks’ holidays, was wholly respon-
sible.
A “spokesman” for the strikers
promised them victory if they held the
country to ransom long -enough, empha-
sising exultantly in his: own crude words
what the chairman of the Joint Coal
Board had said dolefully at the begin-
ning of the previous week; “There are
absolutely no reserves.”
This was rank incitement tol and justi-
fication of blackmail, and under criminal
law blackmail is one of the gravest
offences. This is not the case under
industrial law, though deprivation of
coal may be a sentence of death to poor,
sick, aged people, and though Mr.
Hollway and his colleagues have
shown that union blackmail can be
met and worsted by a Government with
guts, and with a Parliament ready to
pass; any measure required. Under the
Commonwealth and N. S. Wales Coal In-
dustry Acts, as Mf. Hanlon has pointed
out, “the Prime Minister may, in agree-
ment with the Premier, issue directions
to the Joint Coal Board on matters
of policy.” No such direction was
issued, the country, already called
upon to find £250,000 for N.S.W. coal-
fields “amenities,” having been delivered
over as a sacrifice to union blackmailers
by squib “ ‘Labor’ Governments.”
What the Stars Say.
Astrology has been defined as “the
ancient art or science of divining the fate
and future of human beings by the posi-
tions of heavenly bodies.” A current
reference to Dengar (pronounced
“Garden”) Publications prompted the pur-
chase of a copy of “Review” (Incorporat-
ing “Today’s Astrology”), and in this was
found some thrilling stuff for persons
born under the sign of Leo— i.e., between
July 23 and August 22 —as were Shaw,
Belloc, the King of Norway, Lawrence
Binyon, Orville Wright, Princess Margaret
Rose and J. S. Garden.
There is, first, some general advice to
persons born under the sign of Leo:
Do not swerve from your principles.
The temptation to compromise with your
own beliefs can be rather persistent dur-
ing this vibratory cycle. Conserve every
constructive element so that you can have
the support you need in any emergency
that is due to obstructive conditions or
through unforeseen excitements. Verify
statements and postpone all financial
arrangements unless you have a full guar-
antee that you will under no circumstances
be required to risk your capital.
Be alert to safeguard property, real
estate and all similar assets that you own
outright. Communicate with a friend
either through writing or by telephone.
Don’t let enthusiasm for a proposed pro-
ject lead you . into making a rash promise.
Avoid taking any unfamiliar route. Stick
to your customary'''way of doing things.
Although ambitious efforts may not pay
off immediately, the results will show
eventually. Say a few kind words or give
encouragement to a depressed person.
There follows a day-by-day description
of what is in store for “Leos”;
TUESDAY, JANUARY 20.
Finances will be especially important at
this time. Moves for agreements made
at this time will have a splendid run of
success. Any matter that is hanging fire
will be adjusted on the best possible basis.
Finances. Everything overoptimistic
should be curbed.
Health. —Good.
Romance. —Keen wit and intelligence and
love may be cool or jealous.
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 21.
New opportunities or contacts with
strangers may be inspiring or profitable.
Unexpected opportunities cash in on goods
or services should be grasped. News, visits
or moves will add to goodwill and good
cheer.
Finances. —Very well aspected. Superiors
may be surprisingly hard-hearted but never-
theless behind it all you will find that
success will attend your way.
Health. —Good.
Romance. —The evening is very tricky
and sudden changes will force drastic loss
to reputation or money.
THURSDAY, JANUARY 22.
Creative work in industry or personal
advancement should have fresh vision and
impetus. Strong purposes will be stimulated
by love and high ideals.
Finances. —Income can be increased by
a broader scope or by applying new
methods to routine work.
Health. —Good.
Romance. —Just take things easy.
FRIDAY, JANUARY 23.
Secret hopes will fizzle out in the dust.
Today, even keen estimates may be miles

All that The Bulletin knows about
astrology is confined to a distant memory
of the essay in which Swift predicted the
death, “of a raging fever,” at 11 p.m. on
March 29, 1708, of Partridge, the reigning
astrologer of his day, who protested a
fortnight later (the Dean refused to accept
the protestation) that he wasn’t dead.
It will have to correct its ignorance.
POLITICAL POINTS
There has been another increase in the
basic wage, which will be followed by a
rise in prices, which will be followed by
an increase in the basic wage, which
will be followed by a rise in prices. It
recalls the Indian philosopher who was
asked to explain how the world was held
in position. “It stands upon an elephant,”
he said. “And what does the elephant
stand upon?” he was asked. “A tortoise.”
“And what does the tortoise stand upon?”
“I’m sick of metaphysics,” said the philo-
sopher, relapsing into contemplation.
No non-starter M.P. at Westminster
would dare to attack the honor of a
soldier-member as the unspeakable
“Labor” publican Mulcahy attacked the
honor of Blain, that fighting soldier of
two world wars, twice wounded in the
first and a three years’ victim of Oriental
barbarities in the second. Nor, if any such
Westminster outrage can be imagined,
would the Commons have referred it to
a Committee of Privilege composed of
four “Labor” members without military
records and three Opposition members
with military records —two are Old
Diggers and the third enlisted at 18.
Far differently constituted was the com-
mittee it set up to report on the case of
Labor-member Allighan, who, among
other things, had made “unfounded im-
putations of insobriety against unknown
members” ; and it expelled Allighan.
Having refused Blain an open inquiry,
the unmilitary majority of the Evatt-
headed Committee of Privilege heard and
read the evidence. It was all to the effect
that the member for the Northern Terri-
tory was a true soldier of the King who
risked his life and suffered torture in
the hope of saving fellow-Diggers. Some-
body blabbed to friendly Sunday-
paper boys that the committee had found
him guiltless of unsoldierly conduct. No-
thing more than that; nothing about the
beer-pump slanderer Mulcahy. “Labor”
won t get away with it. For a far less
grave offence Mulcahy’s compatriot
Mahon was expelled the House; and
Mahon had had two sons in the first
German war.
That leakage from the Committee of
Privilege was, of course, a breach of
privilege, and a good deal will be said
about it when the House meets. But it
will probably suit the Government to
have the debate switched to a red herring.
N. S. Wales is to have a new Police
Commissioner, the mercurial Mac Kay
having died suddenly. Mac Kay was too
much the man-about-town and had too
many pals to be a Commissioner of the
Mitchell or Fosbery type, but-—as he
maintained to the last —he and his force
got a raw deal from kind-to-criminals
magistrates, Judges and Ministers. And,
after being anathema to “Labor” for
years, he served it well, especially when
“Labor” had the wind up. After the
latest of these occasions he was promised
another trip abroad “on an important
Government mission” (apparently to be
the new formula for these times of dollar
scarcity) which he was fated not to under-
take.
There was a luckless sequel to Federal
“Labor’s” order to the working girls em-
ployed by the Americans in Japan, Guam
and the Philippines to come home at once
and look for jobs, meanwhile turning in
their dollar savings for compulsory con-
version. It was provided by the good-as-
“ Labor” Parry, M.L.C., who was
allowed to go abroad while a Federal
royal commission was examining his
associations with the Federal land-sales
office in Sydney—condemned, though in
wishy-washy sentences. Parry returned to
Sydney with a short account of his travels,
with three members of his family, in
Mexico and the U.S.A. “Labor’s” good-
as-“Labor” protege probably used up
more dollars on these “Labor”-permitted
excursions than “Labor” will get by in-
timidation and extortion from all the
working girls.
During an exciting week for Ward and
his beloved U.S.S.R. (“it has made more
progress in 25 years than any capitalist
country has made in 10 times that period”)
the Americans reported a Ukrainian in-
surrection. They may be wrong, but they
were right about the run on Russia’s One
Big Bank and the Great Rouble Robbery.
And the U.S. State department published
some of the secret documents seized after
the German surrender. They showed that
Stalin and his gang harbored a hatred of
England strikingly suggestive of Ward’s,
though not as impotent—they helped
Hitler with everything in every way until,
their greedy imperialism threatening his,
he turned dog on them. And there are
obviously more chapters to be given to
the world.
The latest wicked coal strike brought
the customary N.*S.W. “Labor” threat to
half a million harassed housewives —those
spied on and found guilty of boiling
water for the teapot or the baby’s bath
would be fined £5OO. This from a party
which habitually whines that £lO fines,
if imposed (as they wouldn’t be),
couldn’t possibly hold the “workers” to
their responsibilities as citizens and as
parties to legally enforceable industrial
awards. The time is coming when
“Labor” will have to satisfy an outraged
people—except in Queensland, where
Hanlon is showing some of the Old
Digger spirit—that it hasn’t been given
over to chumps, cowards and crooks.
Holloway (Labor and National
Service), answering Anthony (October 14,
1947 ; “Hansard,” p. 675):
Mr. J. S. Garden is a member of the
staff of one of the departments I administer.
He occupied that position long before I
began to administer the department. His
duties involve maintaining contact with
employers and trade-unionists, and assist-
ing the industrial section of the Depart-
ment of Labor in New South Wales. Dur-
ing industrial disputes he keeps in contact
with the leaders on both sides and reports
direct to me as well as to the officers of
the industrial section. He has been, and is,
a very useful and helpful officer. In the
exercise of his functions he has been the
means of avoiding the outbreak of many
disputes by notifying me in the early stages
of the trouble. He occupies a very small
room in the Commonwealth Bank building,
Sydney, because he can there keep in close
contact with everybody whom I want him
to contact.
Extracts from the N.S.W. “Industrial
Gazette,” a State Government publica-
tion: “Time lost in dispute dislocations
Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 1946, 752,451 man-
working days; eight months to August
31, 1947, 901,532 man-working days.”
Doctrinaires can’t leave well alone.
When the U.S. tariff on wool stood at
34 cents a pound, “clean content,” the
Americans were buying Australian wool
as they never bought before. Going to
Geneva, Dedman and his Dr. Coombs
campaigned against this tariff —to such
purpose that the Americans stopped buy-
ing, with the result that “Australia is
facing a drop of 32 to 48 million dollars
in its wool cheque from dollar areas for
the financial year to June 30.” At Geneva
also the pair of theorists gave way on
the question of Empire preferences, and
Dedman continued the “fight” for some-
thing or other at Havana (“Australia
Takes Firm Stand at Havana Confer-
ence”). Now the producers of cane-sugar
and dried-fruits are wondering dismally
what is goirjg to happen to their export
trade, without which they will be in the
cart.
Most of the Victorian railways will be
electrified within a few years if the huge
hydro-electric works projected are com-
pleted within that time. Then N.S.W.
coalminers will have lost another good
customer, as they have lost others all
round the Pacific. Their pranks have
kept Victoria on short commons for years
past. Now the Railways Commissioners
are facing the necessity to make further
cuts in country services where one train
already does the work of two.
British “Labor” asked the “national-
ised” coalminers to hew 200,000,000 tons
last year. They failed, though
240,409,400 tons was the output in 1937,
before “nationalisation” was thought of.
The steel industry, still “unnationalised,”
was invited to produce 12,500,000 tons,
and it did, earning compliments from the
“Times” —given to Leftist aberrations
these latter years —on “the remarkable
record rate of steel output,” which
dwarfed the 1938 output of ingots and
castings: 10,393,800 tons. If blather-
skites like Aneurin Bevan have their
way the steel industry will be “national-
ised” this year, in which case it will re-
peat the shocking story of the “national-
ised” coalmines and airways, with the
“nationalised” railways and canals to
keep it company.
There have been fierce anti-British
(and anti-American) riots in Canton and
Shanghai, followed by virulent demands
for a British withdrawal from Hong-
kong. And only yesterday the second
Roosevelt was hailing strife-rent China
as one of the Big Five! Poor Roose-
velt! We Australians owe him much,
for he was generous to a fault; but there
is no getting away from the fact that he
gave in to Stalin at Yalta, being too sick
to realise what he was doing; and that
his niche in history has already sagged
horribly,
Ms.H.R. from four States having ob-
jected, the Chifleys have abandoned their
idea of doubling the number of members
of both Chambers. All the same, “it is
expected that Cabinet will recommend
increasing the membership of the House
to 120 and that of the Senate to 60.”
That would mean 10 Senators from Tas-
mania ; population, 253,000. There are
two from New York; population,
14,000,000.
One of those columnists has a story of
“a well-known punting ‘Labor’ Senator”
who landed a wager of £lOOO to £4OO at
Randwick and was paid in tenners, re-
fusing to take £2OO in fivers. To the
columnist “it doesn’t look as though the
Government intends calling in the tenners
and changing the currency.” It does
“look as though” the politician wanted
to be different.
The revival of the New England New
State movement had a healthy beginning
at Armidale when the summer school of
the Australian Institute of Political
Science was in session. Bishop Moyes
spoke earnestly on the evils of remote
control, and Justice Nicholas described
the formation of new States as “the only
safe form of decentralisation, the best
protection we can find against our
two enemies, dictatorship and anarchy,”
and the emergence of “a lopsided Consti-
tution under which power is divorced
from responsibility as. nowhere else in
the world.” The opposition, very feeble,
was led by an unsuccessful “Labor” can-
didate from Sydney, one Godfrey, “leader
of the socialisation movement in the
State A.L.P.”
, Chief Conciliation Commissioner
Mooney in Melbourne has deferred a de-
cision on claims by motor-body builders
and metal-workers because he wants “to
see how the 40-hour week works out.”
He won’t have long to wait.
It looks as if the soaring cost of
living and the increasing difficulty of ob-
taining materials are impressing even
some “Labor” minds with the fatuity
of trying to create prosperity—“more jobs
than men” —through either spinning out
work or denying reserves of essential
stocks, such as coal. Courtice told the
A.W.U. delegates’ annual conference in
Brisbane that “only the workers them-
selves could put the brake on rising liv-
ing costs.” The A.C.T.U. timidly sug-
gested that increased production might
“offset any tendency of prices to rise.”
Any tendency! Chifley himself admits “a
danger that shortage of labor will reduce
the tempo of industrial expansion.” But
as he addressed his remarks to em-
ployers, with an addendum about a de-
partmental committee to teach them their
business, he still turns a blind eye to the
real troubles and trouble-makers.
An enforced reduction of Evatt squan-
dermania in the dollar areas is “under
consideration.” The farce of keeping
Ministries and staffs in Chile and Brazil
is now too costly even for Our Foreign
Policy to maintain. But these “birds” —
“birds” is the term approved by one
lately numbered among them —are not to
be called home and disbanded. They
“may be sent to Europe to expand Aus-
tralia’s representation there,” and pre-
sumably to maintain the fiction of “full
employment.”
British shipbuilding was leading all
competitors, as always, till socialism
arrived, and with it curtailment of
materials and the shorter working week.
Now “five leading British steamship com-
panies are to boycott British yards be-
cause building costs are too high.” So
easily does socialism kill a nation’s pros-
perity.
There is a daily shortage of 1000 wharf-
laborers at the Port of Melbourne,
and so ships can’t pick up any labor.
As ships are arriving faster than they are
departing, the port has become a forest
of funnels. Of nine ships due to depart
on one day, only four could and did.
Back in the U.S.A. from Czecho-
slovakia, where he was his country’s am-
bassador, one L. A. Steinhardt said a
good thing:
Europe’s greatest need, next to food, is
habeas corpus. That applies to any country
where the police can arrest and hold people
without bringing them before a really in-
dependent tribunal.
Czechoslovakia is becoming one of those
countries, though the Communists are not
yet in full control. “Labor” Government
(Canberra and Wellington) have let it
have a lot of wool on tick. A poor risk.
Thirty pieces of silver:
If publicity is an art, somebody near the
Prime Minister should receive the recognition
due to an artist. When Chifley went to
New Zealand this genius was at his elbow
moving him to empty his pocket and display
its contents —30 shillings. And on the voyager’s
return it was made manifest that he still had
Is. though he handsomely admitted that
his secretary or purse-bearer had a few shillings
more.
And when Chifley prepared to set out for
Westralia, intent on catching up with
Fadden, he was exhibited again in the charac-
ter of a modest, frugal fellow, not at all the
kind to abuse banking or prices powers. A
T.-A.A. girl said there Was no seat for him
on the Government plane about to hit the
breeze for the West. With the humility of
true greatness he accepted the intelligence.
Actually the jaunt to New Zealand was made
in a Liberator specially fitted with half a dozen
seats, a bunk, an observation turret and a few
other luxuries, and carrying a special crew.
Fuel consumption must have been round 1000
gallons. And while the double trip was being
made the R.A.N. held a corvette in readiness,
steam up and crew at stations; 60 men or
more prepared to leap into the Pacific at the
first word of danger. In addition to this pre-
caution a Catalina and a Liberator stood by,
crews at the ready and propellers set to swing
at the first indication that the P.M. was likely
to fall into the drink.
Dollars? Economy? They have no meaning
for “Labor” when “Labor” elects to recruit
its flagging powers at the public cost.

Air-Commodore V. E. Hancock,
0.8. E., D.F.C., to be Commandant of
the new R.A.A.F. Staff College at Point
Cook, graduated from Duntroon in 1928
and was seconded to the RA.A.F. for
three years, but in 1930 decided to make
flying his career. Adjutant of No. 3
Squadron at Richmond in the early
’thirties, in 1935 he became staff-officer to
the C.A.S. After a course at Andover he
spent 12 months with the R.A.F. in 1937,
and towards the end of 1938 he was made
director of Works and Buildings. During
the war he commanded No. 1 Bombing
and Gunnery School, was acting C.O. of
Western Area and then Director of Post-
ings. In 1945 he went to the command
of 100 Squadron, and a couple of months
later took over 70th Wing, with which he
took part in 53 strikes. For his leader-
ship, keeqness and energy he received the
D.F.C. Since fighting ceased he has been
Director of Air Staff Plans and Policy
at R.A.A.F. H.Q.
Another Australian to figure in the re-
shuffle in Indian affairs is Major-General
Ross C. McCay, recently appointed
Chief-of-Staff of the Pakistan Army. He
went from Scotch College, Melbourne, to
join the first batch of trainees at Dun-
troon, graduated, but was passed out
through ill-health. He enlisted in the
A.I.F. in World War One and emerged
a major with the D.S.O. and an artillery
brigade command. He then transferred
to the Indian Army, became Military
Secretary, and was Lord Mountbatten’s
adviser at the time of the attempted ass-
assination of the Viceroy at Peshawar.
Australian artists lost a friend and a
patron in the worthiest sense of the word
with the death last week of Howard
Hinton. An Englishman who came to
Australia as a young man with an in-
timate knowledge of the galleries of
Europe, ho early decided that Australian
art and artists were worth encouraging.
He was working for a shipping concern,
and with his spare pocket-money he
began to buy Bulletin black-and-white
drawings Lambert, Minns, Leist,
Mahony and others who were turning
out fine work in the ’nineties. After a
few years he commenced to add paintings
to his collection—the eajly works of
Hilder, Gruner, Norman Lindsay and
Streeton forming the nucleus. As time
went on he bought not to keep, but to
give away. He gave pictures, to his
friends, to galleries—several hundred to
the National Gallery of N.S.W. —and
above all to the Teachers’ College at
Armidale, to which institution his gifts
ran into over a thousand pictures and
more than 500 books on art. Although
there is probably no front-rank Australian
artist who has not benefited financially
from Hinton’s hobby, he was no mere
collector of names; in every purchase he
showed discriminating taste and a real
sense of artistic values. Eighty-one at the
finish, he had been a trustee of the
National Gallery for nearly 30 years.
In the Eire elections next month De
Valerais biggest headache will be the
New Republican party, whose gains at
recent by-elections caused the Irish leader
to go the country. N.R.P. leader is
Sean Mcßride, who should be capable
of causing loads of trouble if there is
anything in heredity. His father was
Major John Mcßride, a stormy petrel in
Dublin and elsewhere at the beginning
of the century. The major fought for
the Boers with the Irish Brigade and was
later shot for his part in the Easter Re-
bellion in 1916, leaving a widow from
whom he had been separated for some
time. She had been Maud Gonne, in her
day something of a beauty. Poet Yeats
allegedly lost his heart to her, and
romantic souls even averred that for her
sake the stern Kitchener remained a
bachelor.
Replying in the House (April 10, 1946)
to a series of questions asked by Blain,
Chifley said, among other things, that
Jock Garden “is now, and has been for
30 years, an ordained minister of the
Presbyterian Church.” Who’s Who’s
authorised version (1938 edition) is that
Garden went to Bible colleges in Glasgow
and Melbourne, and proceeds: “Minister,
Baptist Church [“former min.” in the
1947 edition] ; Evangelist Church of
Christ in Aus.” These conflicts of
authorities are apt to be embarrassing,

“Becks” on an American Elder States-
man: —
Giving evidence before the U.S. Senate
Foreign Affairs Committee, Bernard Baruch
urged what amounted to a defensive alliance
between America and the countries included
in the Marshall Plan. It isn’t the first time
he has offered advice to his country, though
it hasn’t always been taken. During World
War I President Wilson put him at the head
of his War Industries Board and after the
Armistice asked him to become Secretary of
the Treasury. Baruch declined that job, but
went to Versailles with the President as economic
adviser and had quite a lot to do with the
framing of the financial and economic clauses
of the Peace Treaty. A Democrat, he was
more or less on the outer during the Harding,
Coolidge and Hoover Administrations, but
Roosevelt respected his judgment and consulted
him. frequently, especially during the early years
of his Presidency. It was said of Baruch that
he “probably did more than anyone else in
the country to keep a rein on the New Dealers.”
Baruch is 77, still fit and active and his
wiry figure unwinds to 6ft. 4in. At the be-
ginning of the century when he used to drive
a Panhard “horseless carriage” he was already
a wealthy man, with a fortune made on Wall-
street, and he hasn’t lost much since. In
middle-age he turned his attention to agri-
culture and farm economics and became in-
terested to such an extent that he acted as
adviser to several nation-wide associations of
farmers. In the early years of the war he
adopted the practice of spending half the week
m Washington, holding himself available to the
Government as a sort of free consultant. If
Roosevelt needed him Baruch used to call on
the President; everyone else had to call on
him. In 1943 Roosevelt decided it was time
s^ r f planning for post-war reconstruction
and Baruch was appointed to draw up plans
for “economic demobilisation,” a job into
which at 73 he threw himself with vigor. A
less exacting post, but one of great importance,
was that given him by Truman—chairman of
the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. It was
probably what he learned in that capacity
that caused him to urge his alliance plan upon
the Foreign Affairs Committee. He has no
illusions about Russia; he is the man who
coined the phrase “cold war” to describe
Soviet policy.
Guide lecturers at the National Gallery
in Melbourne have sometimes had
more enthusiasm than knowledge.
Arnold Shore, appointed to the position
under a grant, is .an experienced painter.
A Gallery student under Fred McCubbin
and Bernard Hall, he joined the revolt
against that institution when Max Mel-
drum established his first art school; he
subsequently went into an art partner-
ship with George Bell. Shore has ex-
hibited at the Royal Academy and the
French salons and won a lot of Aus-
tralian prizes, sharing with John Long-
staff the “Herald” art prize of 1938.
From 18 applicants for the job of
academic head of Canterbury University
College, M.L., Dr. Henry R. Hulme, now
scientific adviser to the British Air
Ministry, has been appointed. Holder
of the Cambridge degrees of D.Ph. and
M.A. and lecturer at Liverpool University
for three years', Dr. Hulme is only 39.
His war-time jobs were head of the de-
gaussing section of the Admiralty and
director of naval operational research.
Dead in Sydney at 62, William John
Mac Kay had been N.S.W. Police Com-
missioner since 1935. A Glaswegian and
son of a policeman, he came to N.S.W.
in 1910 and joined the force. In
10 years’ he rose to first-class ser-
geant and a few years later was a
detective-inspector in the C. 1.8. When
he became head of the branch he was sent
on a tour of Britain and America to study
methods of crime-detection, and on
his return he reorganised the C. 1.8.
In 1932 Lang made him Metropolitan
Superintendent, and three years later
Stevens appointed him successor to Chief
Commissioner Childs. Mac Kay was re-
sponsible for the youth-welfare movement
known as the Police-Citizens’ Boys’ Clubs
and the police school for detectives.
Death came suddenly ; he was shortly to
have left on a trip abroad.
Paul Malone, Canadian Press
at Canberra and admirable guide and
philosopher to two Canadian High Com-
missioners, is returning to Ottawa. • He
takes with him as mementoes of his stay a

The elongated features depicted here
by Prior when added to the right body

man whose height, 6ft. sin., entitles him

Oxford as N.S.W. Rhodes Scholar, but
during the past 18 months it has enabled
him to travel in comparative comfort in
contrast to the cramped quarters of the
Beauforts of No. 1 Squadron in which he
served as an observer in the Darwin area
during the war. Before joining the
R.A.A.F. he commenced an engineering
course at Sydney Uni. ; he continued it
after discharge, but switched last year to

the Deas Thomson scholarship for

Edward Goll, the Melbourne pianist
and one of Australia’s most distinguished
teachers, can trace his pianistic descent
back a long way. Haydn was a pupil of
Bach, Mozart of Haydn, Beethoven of
Mozart, Czerny of Beethoven, Liszt of
Czerny, Sauer of Liszt and Goll of Sauer.
There was another link between him and
Kubelik, and when that sensational young
conductor was in Melbourne the first
person he wanted to seek out was Goll.
As a young man Goll was soloist with
his father when that great violinist was
touring Europe, before he went to his
extraordinary successes in America and
U.K.
John Macnamara, dead at 83, had two
unique claims to distinction. He was the
first police magistrate in Melbourne to
order 14 days’ imprisonment for drunken
driving without the option. His stern
attitude towards the alcoholic road-hog
made him conspicuous in the ’twenties—
he retired in 1932. He was clerk of the
courts before he became a P.M., and in
1887 won an Empire competition for.

The Very Rev. G. Haydar, recently
arrived to take over St. Nicholas Ortho-
dox Church on Victoria Parade, will find
plenty of friends in Melbourne. He enter-
tained many Seventh and Ninth Division
soldiers at his home at Tripoli, in
Lebanon. He will represent the ancient
Patriarchy of Antioch and will be able to
conduct his services in English, Greek,

Cfocker has been in charge of the pasture
survey of the South East. He crossed

Made his last landing, Group-Captain Alfred
William Leslie Ellis, M.C., one of the edriy
birds among Australian fighting airmen. He
was 53, and dropped dead at the end
of a day’s work. He first saw the light at
Steiglitz, Victoria, and was an engineer in
Malyern when he joined the infant Australian
Flying Corps for World War I.
He served with the renowned No. 1 Squad-
ron, A.F.C., in the early desert fighting at
Romani —flying one of the old B.Es. with
Wackett as his observer —and continued with
the unit through the Gaza fighting into Pales-
tine, by which time he was a flight-commander.
In Sept., 1917, he was transferred to the
Western Front to No. 4 Sqn., A.F.C., of
.fighting scouts (Sopwith Camels), and to-
wards the end of the war commanded the
squadron and took it to Cologne—the only
Australian unit in the Army of Occupation.
During the stay in Cologne Les Ellis and his
brother-officers did his country the service of
compelling the Cologne “Gazette” to publish
an abject withdrawal and apology of a de-
famatory statement about the" A.I.F. in
1916; it was “publish or have your office
wrecked,” and the editor published. Les Ellis
was in charge of the R.A.A.F.’s Bradfield Park
during World War 11, and between wars was
director of the Studebaker Corporation of
Australasia, vice-president of the A.F.C. and
R.A.A.F. Associations, of the Imperial Service
Club, and a councillor of the United Service
Association.
Into the Silence:
At Monterey, California, at 68, ex-Maori-
lander Roland P. Prentys, former world cham-
pion pistol shot. West Coast manager of the
National Lead Co., he retired in 1942 after
32 years’ service. He served in the British and
Canadian forces in the First World War.
In Melbourne, at 73, Ernest George Monk.
An Englishman, he was one of the munitions
Experts who came from Waltham Abbey factory
in 1910 to establish the works in Melbourne
which grew into the vast war-tiffle acreage of
buildings at Maribyrnong. A. E. Monk, sec-
retary of the A.C.T.U., is a son.
In Melbourne, at 70, Samuel Lyons Mc-
Kenzie, one of the first padres to serve with
the Royal Flying Corps. A graduate of the
Royal University of Ireland, he had been with
Australian Presbyterian Church since 1920.
In Melbourne, at 76, Walter J. Andrew, shire

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Amicus”: “Modern Youth” (B.
1/4/1896) strikes me as being an un-
thinking young cub in questioning the
likelihood of an early start on the Eastern
Suburbs (Sydney) railway. My good
friend George Reid assures me in
confidence that “Yes, it won’t be
long now; no, there will be no
delay,” and Sir Henry Parkes has
made a stirring call for volunteers to
“Stand at my right hand and dig the
tunnels with me.” This proposed railway
will undoubtedly open up the rural area
known as Queen’s Cross, which is ideal for
closer settlement by Semitic races dis-
placed by the Bulgarian Atrocities. Fur-
thermore, having easy access to the sand,
spray and salty airs of Bondi, the cultured
youngsters of future generations will be
able to enjoy pleasant week-ends in sea-
side solitude, far from the madding
crowds.
* * * *
“Spokeshave”: Chairman Jessop, of
the Melbourne Board of Works, has made
a strange request to citizens; he has
asked them to use more water. January
is generally the month when water-users
are being treated like opium-smugglers,
but this summer there has been so much
rain on the catchment-area that the board
has now a record storage of nearly
20,000 million gallons, while daily con-
sumption has been smaller than ever be-
fore, Jupiter Pluvius supplying all the
moisture necessary for suburban gardens.
“We should like people to use more water
now,” says Mr. Jessop, “because we need
the revenue in these days of high costs.”
The spectacle of the home-gardener
drowning his tomatoes in superfluous
moisture or substituting water for beer in
order to help the Board of Works out is a
picture I can’t quite gdt into focus.
* * * *
“Coongan”: I had thought that popular
ditty “The Maori’s Farewell” was worked
to death during the war when it was used
to farewell almost every ship and train
that left from anywhere to go anywhere
else. Now, apparently, it is having its
brief hour as “smash hit” in the U.S.A.,
where, under the title “Now Is the Hour,”
it has been recorded by Bing Crosby,
Kate Smith and Tommy Dorsey’s
orchestra—sales of the records and sheet-
music are, as usual, “fabulous.” A back-
wash of excitement has arisen in Sydney
over the original author of the song.
Friends, relatives and acquaintances of
the late A. B. Saunders claim that he
wrote the ditty and sold it as “The Swiss
Cradle Song” for two (or five) guineas to
a Sydney music-house which published it
under the name of “Clement Scott.” The
music-house, on the other hand, main-
tains that the song was written by an-
other man, still living, who prefers to
remain anonymous. Personally, I dunno
and don’t care—l’m a little tired of the
ditty—but one fellow will be disillusioned.
I first heard the thing sung by an alleged
Maori on a Sydney showboat about 10
years ago. The chap sitting next to me
remarked, “No doubt about these Maoris
—they’ve got some lovely old tribal
songs.”
* * * *
“Conda”; Replying to criticism of the
new war cemetery at Kranji, in Singapore,
Brigadier A. E. Brown of the Imperial
War Graves Commission explained that
the cemetery was not nearly completed. I
haven’t seen Kranji, but the Commission’s
war graves in New Guinea, Rabaul and
Guadalcanal are beautifully kept and
sited. Moresby’s, up towards the Owen
Stanleys at Bomana, nestles in an amphi-
theatre of the hills, the white crosses
reaching in ordered array over lawns of
clipped green. Lae cemetery is, perhaps,
the most colorful, with paths bordered by
flowering tapioca and coleus bushes.
Against the green of palm and banyan-
tree, flowering hibiscus and poinsettia
hang like drapes of motionless flame.
Here, among other heroes, lie Newton,
V.C., and Chowne, V.C. Perhaps the
saddest work in all the Pacific was going
on at Dreger Harbor, where 10,000
Americans were buried. Here members
of the U.S. Grave Maintenance Unit were
exhuming bodies, digging amongst earth
and rotting clothing to find a few pitiful
bones to ship back to America for re-
burial in the soldier’s home town.

“Bob Fee”: In the naming of war-
ships (B. 7/1/’4B) tradition plays the
major part, though smaller ships, such as
destroyers and submarines, frequently
have a common initial letter as the dis-
tinguishing mark of a class. Certainly
the R.N. has no production-line method
for its names of ships as is the case with
our Yankee friends. The U.S. Navy
names its battleships after the States of
the Union, its aircraft-carriers after battles
(Coral Sea, Midway and the like), its
cruisers after the State capitals, its de-
stroyers after its seamen of yore, and its
"You can both come down now — l’ve caught ’em!”
auxiliaries after geographical groups of
names depending on the type of vessel.
In war-time, when requisitioned shipping
steps into the fray, the R.N.’s traditional
naming sometimes has to go by the board.
Then such treasures as Clarinet (a boom-
vessel), Dorothy Duke, Polar Bear and
Zaza (trawlers) and Indian Summer (a
drifter) appear in the Navy list. Still,
Whitesand Bay is not offside by R.N.
rules. Whitesand is well steeped in naval
history, as it is near Plymouth Sound and
Drake and his merry men must often have
anchored in it while waiting for wind or
tide to enter harbor.
“Macnell”: Tell “M 8” (B. 7/1/’4B)
that H.M.S. Whitesand Bay, name not-
withstanding, is a fine little seafighter
whose class-mates were largely respon-
sible for winning the Battle of the
Atlantic. She is a Bay-class frigate de-
signed for A.A. escort work. She mounts
four 4in. dual-purpose quickfirers and a
viper’s-nest of eight Bofors, four of them
twin. But her main offence is the Hedge-
hog on the foc’s’le, a deadly weapon only
recently removed from the secret-list.
This machine, a platform bristling with
steel stalks, over which fit small direct-
action depth-bombs, throws its searching
load in a wide pattern into the sea ahead.
On striking the submerged sub. the bomb
explodes and betrays its position to the
depth-charge rails on the quarter-deck,
Then the big 3001 b. charges drop down.
The frigates possess excellent sea-
keeping qualities, essential, of course,
in their job of ocean convoys; recently
two Bay-class frigates rode out a China
Sea typhoon without mishap.

“Craiser”: The case of the small boy
who was saved from death by crushing
between an 8000-toii steamer and a wharf
in Brisbane by the united pushing of 200
wharfies recalls a cafe controversy in
Melbourne between some first-year
science students and artists. Claim was
made that even a 15,000-tonner could be
moved by a push with the finger provided
the pusher had an external purchase. The
arguments of the laymen so impressed
the budding physicists that the whole
party adjourned to Victoria Docks for a
practical demonstration. Two of the
physicists were invited to push against
the massive bulk of an ocean-liner tower-
ing far into the night above them. The
vessel moved perceptibly half an inch, and
I have never been able to decide whether
it was the tide or whether there was some-
thing in the theory.

“Skipper”; Jimmy, the cabin steward,
hid his 2000 cigarettes in tins which he
placed in buckets of dirty water with
mops standing in them. The buckets
were in full view on deck and the Cus-
toms officers continually walked past them
until one man, somewhat unsteady on
his feet after the ship’s hospitality, tripped
over one. He was most irate, and immedi-
ately removed the mops, emptied all the
buckets over the side and placed them
on the hatch out of the way. Jimmy,
watching the proceedings, muttered,
“Well, it was a good hiding-place, any-
way.”
* * * *
“Spokeshave”: One of the redeeming
features of the Melbourne tram strike was
the absence of noise and the appalling
spectacle of citizens packed to suffocation
and being rocked and bumped into a state
of stupefaction in the double-decker buses.
As with other alleged amenities of our
civilisation people put up with these dis-
comforts because they come under the
guise of “progress,” and things are becom-
ing worse instead of better. I read that
an American experimenter has succeeded
in projecting a vehicle of some sort along
rails at a speed of over 1000 miles an
hour. There was nobody in it, but one
can’t believe that in a few short years
the scientists won’t find a way of convey-
ing passengers from the suburbs to the
city in a similar container. The only
advantage is that it will travel faster than
sound, so that the victim won’t hear his
own screams of anguish.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: In some trepidation I
endorse “Zake’s” remarks concerning the
female leg (B. 24/12/’47). But did he
see the photograph of the male leg that
won a heat in the female leg competition?
Such twin yards of pump-water would
have disgraced any masculine contest. I
once saw a masculine leg competition con-
ducted at a surf carnival. The judges
(feminine) haggled long before reaching
a majority verdict on the winner, but
promptly and unanimously allotted the
booby prize to “The knobbiest, ugliest
legs seen on this beach.” Those defamed
pins were renowned on the football field,
and had borne their owner to victory in
the beach-race event at more surf car-
nivals than you could poke a stick at.
* * ♦ *
“Becks”: I’m all for looking on the
bright side of things, but I can’t help
feeling that the man who last week
advertised a large sedan car for sale,
mentioned that it was fitted with radio
and suggested that it was “most suitable
funeral hire-car” was going a bit too far.
Still, maybe he was right. Radio pur-
sues us everywhere nowadays, so why
shouldn’t it follow us to the grave? Any
enterprising broadcasting station would
be only too willing to supply an appro-
priate programme, and there should be no
difficulty in getting a “mortician” to
sponsor it. And what better finish could
a radio-fan dream of than to be carried
to his repose with a favorite “session”
in full blast? That, of course, would
entail some careful timing of the cere-
mony, and the Gravediggers’ Union
would probably have something to say
about that.
* * * *
“Fox-how”: I read that in future sea-
men and firemen on Australian ships will
be served with the same food as officers.
There would have been trouble on some
of my old ships if seamen had had to
content themselves with saloon fare.
Most who dined amidships rarely enjoyed
the savory blackpan and oodle that the
sailors and firemen Cooked up for them-
selves in the stilly watches of the night—
although I did manage to wrap myself
rounds it at times. I remember on a
trip from Sydney to Melbourne part of
our deck-cargo consisted of bagged
oysters. Late at night I passed the galley
on the way to my cabin, and the air was
laced with the rich smell of oyster stew.
The firemen’s Peggy put his head out.
“What do you say to a spot of oodle,
Sparks? I’ll bring you up a plateful if
you like.” “You bet!” I said and went
up to copy the news. Some time later
the curtain was pushed back and in came
Peggy, a mess-tin full of stew, bread and
butter and a mug of coffee. He grinned
at me, turned his head towards the wire-
less and said, “Don’t s’pose you’d mind
telling a bloke the Randwick results?”
It was my turn to grin. “It will always
be a pleasure,” I said, and handed him
the extra copy of the news bulletin I’d
made in anticipation. I got oodle every
race-night after that.

“Annerley”: Stalwarts had defaced a
brick wall in South Brisbane with the
notice: “Nationalise Banks, Coal, Steel.”
Someone with an ounce of critical
brain had chalked out the last three
words and substituted: “Brothels, Two-
up Schools, S.P. Books. Stick to what
you understand.” It seemed such good
advice I feared it would be wasted. It
was; someone with a mop and water
had the whole wall swept clean next day.

“Jemac”: Deserted since the war, the
Officers’ Training School, in Flinders
Naval Depot, which trained all lower-
deck aspirants during the war, is again
flying the white ensign. Re-commissioned
on January 7, the school’s new trainees
are recently-selected naval aviation pilots,
the first of the R.A.N.’s ambitious flying
scheme. Most are experienced opera-
tional pilots, five having served with the
British Pacific fleet; but as seamanship,
regardless of scientific developments, is
still the Navy’s primary concern, all
trainees must first and foremost be ex-
ecutive seagoing officers. Here in a con-
centrated course of 4\ months they will
learn naval discipline, navigation, naval
traditions and customs and all the. multi-
farious subjects that go to make a sea-
man. Then they will be let loose in the
air. «

“F.S.”: I find, with some amuse-
ment, that I am now permitted to read
Farewell to Arms, The Well of Loneli-
ness, Moll Flanders and a long list of
other works I read long years ago, the
Customs ban on their importation having
lately been lifted. Some scribe has dis-
covered that no reasons were ever given
for their banning, and none for the
removal. This is natural. Official cen-
sors don’t know why they ban books, and
even if they gave reasons the reasons
given wouldn’t be the real ones, for
most of our motives are quite uncon-
scious. This can lead to some quaint
situations. In pre-war days a committee
was formed to fight book-censorship, and
a monster meeting was held at the Mel-
bourne Town Hall. One of the speakers
produced a copy of a banned book and
asked for permission to read certain pas-
sages. The committee hastily perused
the volume, and after an agitated con-
ference the chairman announced that the
speaker’s request could not be granted.

“The Capt.”: When some New Year
roisterers put a nose-bag on the South
African war-memorial horse in Anzac-
square, Brisbane, most of the citizenry
were resentful of the desecration, but old
Light Horsemen remembered seeing the
equestrian statue of Ibrahim Pasha in
Opera-square, Cairo, dressed in a com-
plete suit of Australian uniform with a
slouch-hat on his head (kangaroo-feathers
included) and a nose-bag attached to the
horse’s head. The cry against that out-
rage can still be heard today when every
now and again the Gyppos howl against
the British.
A TOLERANT CENSOR.
“Mr. 0. J. Alexander, Commonwealth Film Censor,
explaining why some films are barred or cut and
others not interfered with, mentioned that there was
no irrevocable ban on expletives, such as the word
‘bloody,’ if they are used- naturally and are essential
to the humor of the dialogue.”
You chaps who fashion talkies for the mob
And find the Censor’s concept of his job
Useful to study,
Here’s one assurance you’ll be glad to con:
There’s no irrevocable ban upon
Such terms as “bloody.”
The context and the tone in which it’s heard,
The emphasis that’s laid upon the word,
Mild or intensive,
Are the deciding means employed to tell
Whether it’s rude and reprehensible
Or inoffensive.
It may be used for rounding off a quip,
Something no reasonable censorship
Wants to sub-edit.
And obviously quite a lot may rest
Upon the point to whom it was addressed,
Also, who said it.
If featured in some hall of high debate
A brisk blue-pencilling would be its fate
One may conjecture;
And what a storm of protests ’twould incite
Served up as seasoning for some erudite
Professor’s lecture!
You couldn’t put it in a drawing-room scene
To spice the speech of (say) a rural Dean,
But there are places
(Like pubs) where such objection none advances.
Localities as well as circumstances
Will alter cases.
Without such expletives what would you do,
You playwrights holding up the mirror to
Ways mired and muddy?
So mind, when next crisp dialogues you plan,
There’s really no insuperable ban
Imposed on “bloody.”

T. THE R.


“Oxmead”: “The purest poetry,” a Red
Page writer (B. 21/1/*4B) tells us, “has
always been that from which adjectives
were eliminated,” and he goes on to
buttress his theory by citing some of the
most beautiful and unforgettable lines
that Shakspeare ever wrote;
Daffodils
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty.
Well and good, but how about two other
gems of pure poetry, perhaps as often
quoted, which have long been accepted
as unbeatable for inspired word-music.
The first, of course, is from Coleridge,
the second from Keats:
A savage place, as holy and enchanted
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
Consider the wealth of adjectives packed
into these few lines.

“Pookie”: In one of those small but
prosperous little shops in King’s Cross a
slight woman in a raincoat was placing a
large order: “Eggs ... ham .. . bread ~ .
tomatoes . . . bananas . . . Oh, and you’d
better give me a pound of tea.
Butter ...” The goods piled up, and
the happy immigrant behind the counter
said “Dat iss all?” “And a packet of
cigarettes, please,” said the shopper
calmly. “No cigarettes,” said the pro-
prietor with a marked diminution of
geniality. “In that case,” said the shopper,
putting her coupon-book and a pound
note back in her bag, “I can’t do business
with you. I must shop where I can get
cigarettes.” “Zat iss nod ze way I do
buziness,” shouted the proprietor, furious
at being bearded in his own den. “I just

the small woman, “And it is the way Ido

business.” Calmly she went out of the
shop, leaving me breathless with admira-
tion and the proprietor stricken behind
his heaped eggs, ham and two dozen
bananas. Buying some of these fruit I
reflected humbly that a few more strong-
minded women in the neighborhood
might enable me to buy cigarettes without
paying Is. 3d. for a packet of 10. With
a glow of vicarious courage I said “Any
smokes?” and got a packet—at the right
price. The proprietor still looked a little
dazed.

“Casey”: A new angle on the 40-hour
week. At the Third Test at Melbourne
a bloke at the back of me was discussing
the new rule whereby the captain of the
fielding side can call for a new ball after
40 overs. The Indians had bowled 45
overs before Amarnath called for the ball.
“Why,” demanded the bloke at the back,
“is there a new ball at 40 overs? Why
40?” His mates thought on this point
for a while, and at last one tentatively
suggested, “Well, it’s a 40-hour week, and
it fits in, doesn’t it?” Then after brood-
ing on the matter he ventured, “That
ball’s entitled to five overs’ overtime!”

“Millswyn”; A pub in Prahran (Vic.)
has the uncommon name of The Duke of
Windsor ; it discarded its old and honored
name shortly after the abdication of
Edward VIII, and assumed for its own
the new title of the ex-king. My vote
for the oddest-named hotel in Melbourne
goes to The Gasometer View, in Fitzroy.
“Waddlin’ Willie”: One of Victoria’s
oldest pubs—Mack’s Hotel, Geelong —
has given up its licence after 108 years.
When the first liquor law became opera-
tive on January 1, 1839, Mr. Andrew
McNaughton (after whom the premises
later became known as Mack’s) applied
for a licence. It was granted with the
endorsement: “First licence granted for
Geelong.” Meetings for the launching
of most of the pioneering activities of the
district were held at the pub. Even
royalty honored it; the Duke of Edin-
burgh was entertained there in 1867.

“Craiser”: Melbourne “Age” solemnly
announced, under headlines, an “ufi-
usual casualty” treated at the Royal Mel-
bourne. A young man sought medical
attention to a finger which, he said, had
been bitten by a goldfish. “Having been
assured that the bite was not poisonous,”
the paper added, “the patient, after treat-
ment, went home with his mind at ease.”
Nobody was more surprised to read this
item than the young resident m. 0., who,
having cut his finger, had been asked by
the nurse to what she should ascribe the
accident in the official logbook, and had
retorted: “Oh, bitten by a goldfish.”
* * * *
“Findy”: Now that drinking conditions
are getting back to something like normal
one can look back on the war-time pig-
swilling with a slightly less jaundiced eye.
I recall an occasion in a Brisbane
pubbery in 1944. With beer short and
pubs open for only an hour or so queues
of thirsty beer-hounds used to form up
outside every hotel an hour or more be-
fore the beer was due to be turned on.
To avoid obstructing foot traffic the police
used to make the queues i keep to the
extreme edge of the footpath. The blokes
would wait there more or less patiently
until the doors were opened; then there
would be an unholy rush, and woe betide
anyone who got in the way. Meeting
softie mates one day I joined a waiting
queue. I was new to the custom and un-
prepared for the rush. When it came I
was lifted off my feet and swept
into the pub, finishing up right alongside
the bar. I didn’t object to that—quite
the contrary. The ones who objected
were the two middle-aged ladies who hap-
pened to be passing when the door
opened, and in a split-second found them-
selves for the first time in their lives
breasting a hotel bar.
“Oliver Filter”: During the war the
C.Os. of two small northern R.A.A.F.
stations about 100 miles apart were given
to relieving the monotony by exchanging
facetious messages. When one of them
received a warning note from his cobber,
“Accountant officer coming our way. Very
difficult bloke,” he replied, “Thanks for
the tip. Will kill him with kindness,” By
that time the first C.O. was experiencing
the accountant officer, so he dispatched
a further word to his cobber: “An ex-
cellent idea. Poison might be quicker.”
A few days after the A.O. arrived at the
second station he collapsed in his tent
with a violent attack of food-poisoning ;
he was very ill and weak for several days,
but recovered and went south again,
where his favorite topic for months
was Flight-Lieutenant Soandso: “Never
known such a splendid fellow. He nursed
me like a mother for 24 hours a day
and even had them fly a doctor 300 miles
to make certain I was all right.”

“Also Ran”: I don’t think “Ex-C.G.’s”
explanation of the derivation of the word
“drongo” (B. 14/1 /’4B) is correct. I un-
derstand the word to be a combination of
“drone” and “dingo”—the attributes of
both of these, combined in the one per-
son, produce the drongo.

“Youanmi”: Ever since senility set in
about 40 years ago, my wife’s grandfather
has risen, retired, eaten, bathed and
gardened by the stars. Having been
cautioned by an astrologer, he has always
refused to eat eggs lain by roosters, or
mushrooms grown in dry, sandy places,
and he has always avoided throwing him-
self under moving trains on Tuesdays. At
last, however, the old boy has forsaken
the stars, the cause being some astro-
logical matter published in Sydney’s
“Daily Mirror” of January 20, 1948:
Tomorrow is January 21 The sun
moves into Aquarius at 1.25 p.m.—an event
of some importance to the world, because
it is a “key month” in the great new
“Golden Age.” The entry of the sun
into Aquarius will start the long trek of
mankind into sanity, so that by 1962 we
shall be almost as prosperous as we were
in 1930.
As grandfather maintains, if the stars are
going to lead us to the “prosperity” of
1930, Chifley or somebody had better get
the sun out of Aquarius, and pretty damn’
quick.

“Strop”: Despite the scorn of “F.S.”
(B. 24/12/’47), photography is as much
an art as music, with rules of grace,
harmony and balance in composition just
as rigid. The trouble is that most camera-
clickers play by ear and “vamp” instead
of studying the elements of design. It
can easily be demonstrated that the Old
Masters and the new experts in poster-
work follow a definite “scale” which is
universal and eternal. In a recent con-
test in S.A, the three “placed” photos
all followed the same pattern of optical
centre, balance from left-top to right-
bottom, and selective harmony of parts.
Probably neither the judges nor the com-
petitors knew the rules, but- the results,
accidentally or deliberately obtained, were
so pleasing that the awards were inevi-
table.

“Lackspear”: Among the latest addi-
tions to the P.M.G.’s stamp menagerie of
Australian fauna is what looks likb a
crocodile in a Scotch tartan. A border evi-
dently representing a plan of the maze at
Hampton Court surrounds the figure,
which is labelled in clear firm letters
“Aboriginal Art.” “Technical College
Art” would be a better title.
* * * ♦
“Bullengro”: The institution of women
traffic-police to Sydney evoked both com-
plaints and compliments, but it seems
that the ladies can do their job well
enough. And there’s no reason why they
shouldn’t, provided they have the endur-
ance, mental and physical, to stand up to
the exasperating and generally thankless
task of keeping pedestrians and motorists
apart. I can see some possibilities, too.
After making a minor blue a man can
always smile tenderly at the female battle-
axe as she descends upon him and mur-
mur, “I was startled by your resemblance
to my dear mother.” Or, if she s young
and trim, the embarrassed approach
might work: “Well—er—you know you
looked so nice and fresh standing there
that my mind wandered from the wheel
for a moment.” But it’s the drunks I
fear for. Males, including policemen,
generally have a measure of good-natured
tolerance for a bloke under the weather.
But women! They just don’t understand.
* * * *
“X.S.”: Melbourne police patrol-
women now have a natty uniform just
like their male colleagues, and on their
first night out they ran in one of their
own sex as a drunk and disorderly per-
son. The official assumption is that the
wrongdoer will show respect for the uni-
form whatever gender is inside it. Before
the war policewomen went about their
business in mufti, and on one occasion
two policemen were having difficulty with
a drunk —an abusive and violent wharfie.
He was as powerful as a gorilla and their
united efforts couldn’t get him into a taxi.
They were both lying on their backs
when a policewoman came up and led
him off like a lamb.

“Camsa”: - There’s still resourcefulness
in the Australian, but it comes mostly
from the inland. Anxious to catch a
special tram from Glenelg to link with
the mines train returning from Adelaide
to Broken Hill after the Christmas holi-
days, a harassed miner asked the dis-
patcher to hold the tram until he found
his wife, who was shopping. The dis-
patcher said the tram must go on time,
so the miner, loaded with his holiday
gear, walked between the tracks with the
tram at his heels until he spotted his
wife. He yelled for her, she got on the
tram and he joined her.

“F.S.”: Thanks to the Felton Bequest,
Melbourne National Gallery will shortly
have another Gainsborough to add to the
two portraits it already possesses. The
new acquisition, “View at the Mouth of
the Thames,” cost £9OOO and, if it is a
good example of the English master’s
landscape painting, sounds a good buy ;
the last Gainsborough landscape sold in
England fetched £19,000.

“Allwet”: One tramless morning in
Melbourne I stood vainly thumbing pass-
ing cars; then ray neighbor forties
guided me alongside a shimmering blonde
a little further down. “Try and look
like someone who lives down the same,
street and knows her brother,” he ad-
vised me. Within the minute a sleek
sedan had pulled in and the blonde was
comfortably settled in the front seat;
forties and I were in the back. “It never
misses,” he confided, “fust pick out the
prettiest girl in sight. She always gets a
lift.”

“Itchy” on oddities of the calendar:
Next month, February, 1948, bears more
than usual significance by virtue of its added
leap-year day. But it holds another distinction
in that, this year, it contains five Sabbath days.
According to Archdeacon H. B. Atkinson, this
state of affairs has occurred on only seven
occasions since 1611! The first day of Feb-
ruary holds some fascination for students of
numerics, for on that day we will date our
outward mail with the mystic symbols 1 /2/’4B
—doubling each succeeding figure as we write.
We saw the combination in reverse in the year
of the second Commonwealth Census: 8/4/’2l.
Another odd date this year will be the repeti-
tive 4/8/’4B, in August. However, we get an
example of this type every year. Nineteen
thirty-three and 1944 gave us the rarer 3/3/ 33
and 4/4/’44 respectively. Not for another
seven years will Father’ Time oblige us again
with a “rhyming date-line” on May 5, 1955.
At the breakfast-table one morning in the dim
and misty future a suburban wife will observe
a really provocative date on the top of her
morning newspaper. “2/4/’68,” she’ll exclaim
thoughtfully. To which her weary husband,
quite disregarding its true significance, will
probably mumble: “Yair; buck in, don’t
wait! ”
ADJECTIVES.
“The purest poetry has always been that from
which adjectives were eliminated.”— R.P., Zl/I{’4B.
You bards whose job’s to woo the Muse,
Metres to watch and rhymes to find,
Here’s what will help you if you choose
To keep it ever in your mind;
While quite a lot of parts of speech
Our language liberally gives
And places well within your reach,
Go gently with your adjectives!
TEstheticism sets no curbs,
When inspiration comes your way
On preposition’s, nouns and verbs
Wherewith your talent to display,
But would you up Parnassus climb
And find your songs a source of divs.
Here’s something you should learn in time:
Eliminate your adjectives.
Conjunctions, interjections too,
May profitably be employed
To engineer a sonnet through
Its course or fill in ballad’s void.
No ban upon the adverb lies
(Unless it splits infinitives)
But listen, comrades, you’ll be wise
To have no truck with adjectives.
But is this poetry? With a brow
Of scorn I hear the critics scoff.
Well, maybe not, but anyhow
It claims one attribute thereof.
Excepting where my stanzas end
(And there, of course, they’re substantives)
You’ll note this slab of verse is penned
Without recourse to adjectives.

This big Victorian brewing organisation,
which enjoys a lion’s share of the trade in
its home State, finished its last term with
an expanded turnover but smaller profit.
Advancing costs were, and still are, the
trouble. Hops and barley were scarce —
some hops had to be imported—and the
price high. Also bottles were in short
supply, which meant that more of the
brew than usual had to be sold in bulk,
which is slightly less profitable than the
bottled stuff. Wage-lifts and an all-round
rise in prices bumped up outgoings, while
selling prices, fixed by official edict, re-
mained steady, and have done so since
1920.
Some idea of how turnover has stepped
along can be had from the following com-
parison of Federal excise collections on
beer; —

Growth last year was £4,726,917, approxi-
mately 21 p.c., and the Treasury expects
a further increase of £254,000 in total re-
ceipts for 1947-48. Excise per gallon
ascended by irregular steps from Is. 9d.
in 1939 to 4s. 7d, in 1942, and has re-
mained steady since. The Government
now makes off with 14s. 7d. of every
pound the brewer receives for bulk beer.
The other ss. sd. has to cover the whole
cost of production, distribution, adminis-
tration and taxation, as well as profits,
which are taxed again as dividends in the
hands of shareholders.
The contraction in net earnings was
£47,076, making the slip £66,807 over the
last two years. The £403,659 of profit
was written after deducting outside share-
holders’ interests, allowing for minor re-
serve adjustments, depreciation (£52,851,
down £2080) and whatever was considered
necessary for taxation. It is not clear
whether provision was made for War-
time (Company) Tax, which has been
abolished in respect of 1946-47 earnings.
The £403,659 was 12.4 p.c. on the
£2,925,000 of capital (it includes 300,000
£l7 p.c. prefs., which advance with the
ords. beyond that rate), compared with
15.4, 16, 16.1, 14.7, 17.2 and 19.1 p.c.
back to 1941. The div, was kept at 10 p.c.
for the fifth year in succession—it was
steady at 12-y p.c. for the half-dozen years
before that—but the board “did not ex-
pect the rate tp be maintained.”
Since the close of accounts sugar has
gone up a pound, adding about
£28,000 p.a. to the co.’s outgoings ; and
each lift of 3d, a bushel in the price of
barley means an extra'£ls,ooo p.a. to the
co. The price of other materials has risen,
too, and so have the basic wage and
margins for skill, while introduction of
the 40-hour week from the beginning of
1948 has further aggravated the position.
Apart from the effect of the time factor
on costs, the 40-hour week is equivalent
to a 10 p.c. lift in hourly wage rates.
Because of all this an interim div. at the
rate of 8.3 p.c. p.a. has just been declared
for the current term. With one exception
(1935, when 8 p.c. was paid) it is the
lowest rate of distribution since 1919,
C.U.B.’s capital is not held directly by
the public, but by the following holding

In addition to divs. from their holdings in
C.U.8., some of the cos. gather rents,
etc., from property on their own account.
Carlton has just declared an interim div,
for the current term at the old rate of
13 p.c. p.a., but it is doubtful whether all
the other holding cos. will be able to
maintain the old rates of distribution. A
slight shading in the market price of their
scrip can therefore be expected.
C.U.8., which owns a little over 8 p.c.
of the hotels in Victoria, has a million-
pound remodelling and rebuilding pro-
gramme ahead, when labor and materials
become available. It is unlikely that
shareholders will be asked to assist:

for the £1 ords. —follows the completion
of a deal whereby the Austin Motor Co.,
Ltd., of England, takes over a Melbourne
concern, Ruskin Motor Bodies, Ltd.,
which had been making Austin bodies
since 1945. “This was done,” Austin
Motors’ chairman told his own share-
holders in England the other day, “be-
cause for some time now the production
of bodies in Australia has not been keep-
ing pace with the shipment of chassis
from Birmingham. Members of our pro-
duction staff are now in the Ruskin fac-
tory, and we hope by rearrangement and
by new tooling and assembly methods
to increase the output considerably....
Equipment for producing the A4O Devon
and Dorset bodies is now being installed.”
A4os are the new 10-1 Ih.p. vehicles
which Austin is able to turn out by mass
methods since Britain abolished the
former graduated tax on horsepower.
Mass-production should improve Austin’s
output by over 50 p.c., the target being
3400 vehicles a week. The great majority
will be for export—with special emphasis
on U.S.A., though this country also is
sure to benefit.
Austin Distributors, Ltd., a purely
Australian co. holding the Austin fran-
chise for Victoria and part of the Riverina
(N.S.W.) district, has been soundly man-
aged since it came under the public gaze
in 1931. Anticipating the cessation of
overseas supplies in 1940, the co. bought
so heavily in advance that throughout the
war it was never out of stock of new
cars, though deliveries had, naturally, to
be restricted to essential users. Repair-
work offered further war-time occupation,
but the funds which formerly financed a
large “terms-sales” business and stock re-
placements had to be diverted to in-
vestment in Government and industrial
securities. Since 1945 these funds have
been steadily reconverted into new stocks
—the disposal of £45,071 in shares bring-
ing in £7693 more than their cost-price:

the long Victorian metal-trades dispute—

Tax-relief, the absence of long indus-
trial hold-ups so far this term, and the
prospect of both larger chassis imports
and a more forceful handling of the body-
building problem all suggest improved
earnings in the near future. Later on

a chain of 90-odd stores in country dis-
tricts in Vic., N.S.W., S. Aus. and Tas.
It also owns woollen and hosiery mills at
Collingwood (Vic.), thus gathering whole-
sale as well as retail profits on many
lines. The Victorian stores are at Col-
lingwood, where the business was set on
its feet by Mark Foy in 1868, Prahran,
Fitzroy and Bourke-street, Melbourne,
where about £500,000 was paid for the
site in 1926.
The co. ran into heavy weather during
the economic blizzard of the early 1930’5,
when the Brisbane store (opened in 1903)
and some of the factories were closed.
At end July, 1940, pref. divs. were
years in arrears. By that time, however,
earnings had made a splendid recovery,
and the prefs.’ slate was cleaned in 1943,
when the ords. came into the picture again
with 6 p.c., which was repeated with wide
margins for the three succeeding years,
followed by 7 p.c. last term.
The year to end July last was a sellers’
market, and all the co.’s stores enjoyed
substantial increases in turnover, the gain
being more marked in suburban than in
city centres. The mill earned more, too,
despite shortages of labor, soda-ash and
soap and difficulties associated with fuel.
The Westralian co. paid 9 p.c. as against
7 p.c. for the previous year, but nothing
was received on the holding in O. Gilpin,
which stands in the books at £509,169
(cost).
Gross earnings from all sources
(£1,053,749) shot up £220,048, about
25 p.c. Administrative exes. (£595,870,
up £96,301) took 56.6 p.c. of gross as
against 60 p.c. for the previous term.
After allowing for rates, land taxes, etc.
(£58,174, up £4835), depreciation
(£34,883, up £2518), income tax (£141,252,
up £47,750) and contribution to the staff
fund (£lO,OOO, up £5000), the net amount
available for shareholders was £213,570
(up £63,644). It covered the 6 p.c. pref.
div. (£21,000) and 16 p.c. on ord. capital
as against 11.8 p.c. for the preceding
year. Money was wanted in the busi-
ness, so only a point was added to the
div., making it 7 p.c., of which 4 p.c. was
tax-free. The £108,570 that remained
lifted reserves to £473,657, excluding
£401,175 excess par value over cost of
inter-co. holdings.
To provide more working capital for
the mill and for replacement of some
worn-out equipment, the board sought
authority to gather £300,000 of fresh 5
p.c. pref, capital. Shortly before the
close of accounts permission was given
to put out 150,000 of these shares, of
which 120,000 were taken by those on the
ord. register and the balance by em-
ployees. When the books closed paid
capital was £1,630,572 in 350,000 6 p.c.
and 150,000 5 p.c. cum. prefs. and
1,200,000 ords. There was then £69,428
to come on the new issue:

To meet the year’s growth of £117,162
in stocks and of £68,310 in debtors’
balances the co. added only £16,016 to
the outside debt, making it £1,128,311.
The' improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£1,198,768 including share-
holdings) was £164,866,
The three main factors governing the
level of retail profits today are: (1) turn-
over, (2) gross margins and (3) costs.
With costs advancing and gross margins
diminishing, profit has now become
largely a function of turnover. Hence
the chairman’s warning that:
A marked decline in sales could not be
offset by a prompt and equivalent reduction
in costs, and, in that event, net profits
would fall away very much more rapidly
than the decline in sales would suggest.
When retail turnovers get into reverse-

Zinc Corp., New Broken Hill
Consolidated and Imperial
Smelting Corp., all London-
controlled, have jointly decided
to set up new‘]plant in Australia
for production of sulphuric acid
from the roasting of zinc con-
centrates, for utilisation of the
acid in the fertiliser and chemi-
cal industries, and for produc-
tion, fabrication and commercial
use of zinc metal, D. P. C.
Neave, managing director of
Imperial Smelting, is to visit
Australia next month to decide
details connected with the ven-
ture. Work is to begin as soon
as manpower and materials per-
mit. At the moment only por-
tion of the zinc concentrates
produced by the big mining cos.
at the Barrier is taken and
treated by Electrolytic Zinc at
Risdon (Tas.); the balance is
sold mainly to Imperial Smelting
for treatment in Britain. Erec-
tion of new roasting and zinc-
treatment plans in Australia is
not likely to interfere with the
activities of Electrolytic Zinc,
and ought to mean much so far
as employment is concerned, as
well as make a handsome contri-
bution to our export income.
For many years all the mining
cos. at the Barrier have played
an important part in the de-
velopment of Australia’s heavy
industries.

R. C. Wilson, late state
Mining Engineer,” in the pros-
pectus describes the leases as
1568 X Mt. Eba and 1567 X
South Lease, each 24 acres,
and:; —
The ore-body is a quartz reef in
greenstone country, having a strike
of N.3odeg. and an easterly underlay
of 50deg. from the horizontal. As
will be noted from the surface plan
prepared by Mr. J. T. Eddy, the reef
outcrops at the surface for a length
of some 750 ft. It pinches in places
to a few inches in width and widens
out in others to 6ft. or 7ft., and will
p ®£aps average 16-20 inches in
width. The principal workings are
wt°Z, a L p, e WhiP
shaft and the Windlass shaft.
!n these two shafts, the workings
f a f r °f X nna ly
extend for a length of LOft. Else
where all workings appear to be
under 50ft. in depth.
As to future development, J.
T Fddv minim* ennineer is
• f ° ay ’ mmmg en B lneer 5 ts
quoted ;
It is recommended, as the first
step, to sink the Whip shaft a fur-
ther 100 ft., and drive at that random
say 200 ft. This work would be better
carried out on contract, the esti-
mated cost should not exceed £2OOO.
Tbp nmcnpetiK docpriho* the
Ifie prospectus describes me
reel as
a fissure reef of varying size, with
clean walls, of considerable length,
and has every indication of persistence
at depth. The values appear to be
in shoots, at frequent intervals and
all evidence available indicates that
the average of these will enable pro-
fitable mining to be undertaken. The
ore is free and presents no treatment
difficulties
Mr. Wilsons report on pro-
duction from the property since
1898 speaks of 822 long tons
treated by various interests for
a recovery of 375 fine ounces of
goid by amalgamation, an aver-
age of 9.ldwt. The sands he
estimates, would average 3dwt.,
making total gold content
12.1dwt. a ton, Mr. Eddy men-
tions 21 samples taken by him
‘•from the surface and under-
ground" averaging lOdwt over
20 inches width.
The body of the prospectus
id fl little hard tn follow on the
auestion of ore reserveT' -
quesuon or ore reserves.
Reference to the report of Mr.
J. T. Eddy will show an estimated
production over a length of 200 ft.
down to the 170 ft. level (assuming
the continuity of the reef at depth
an d an average value of lOdwt. per
ton). From this it will be seen that
Mr. Eddy estimates that a profit of
£13,486 will be obtained to the 170 ft.
j eve j Profits probably obtainable
over the 400 ft. known extension of
the ore-body have not been estimated,
but it will be seen from the repmt
that the ore available would be in-
creased 13,350 tons over the pro-
jected 170 ft. level,
Mr. Eddy puts it this way:-
, ;, ... .
The probable ore reserves indicated
above the 170 ft. level would be 4650
tons and a further 400 ft. extension
northwards would indicate 13,850
tons -
He estimates mining and treat-
ment costs at 30s. a ton, apart
from the contract charge for
development already mentioned,

The Franc
The projected devaluation of
the franc, from 480 to the £
sterling to 864, has been in the
wind for over a year. The 480
figure was regarded as flattering
to the French economy when
first established in 1946, and
sterling, overvalued though it
may have been in dollars at the
official rate, was a keenly-sought
currency in France. The heavy
depreciation of the franc is con-
trary to the terms of the Inter-
national Currency Fund Agree-
ment, and it will put sterling at
a greater disadvantage than
ever, mainly so far as exports
“Now please calm down. Madam; there'll be no charge .”
from Britain to France are con-
cerned. Other world’s markets
may not be greatly affected by
the slide in the franc: it is still
easier to sell goods than to buy
them, on the whole. Should
Britain be forced to revalue
sterling at $3 or thereabouts in-
stead of $4.02 the Australian
rate on London may require ad-
justment, as the “exchange” cost
of imported—especially dollar —
goods is already fantastically
high compared with our own in-
ternal purchasing-power parity,
and the situation is misleading
to the extent that it implies a
lower level of Australian pro-
duction costs which, in terms of
man-hours, does not really exist.
The Trade Agreement
The international tariff agree-
ment to which Australia is a
party, and under which it re-
ceived a particular benefit
from the United States in
the form of a cut from
34 cents to 25£ cents a poupd on
greasy wool, has to be ratified by
each country concerned after
six months’ operation. Already
the agreement has been severely
criticised b y manufacturers’
representatives in the Common-
wealth, and their objections will
have to be taken seriously.
When the time for ratification
does arrive it will be entitled to
receive more than the usual
chopped-off Parliamentary dis-
cussion. A sort of promise has
been made that the “Labor”
Government will allow this.
Not so long ago the “Labor”-
party Ministers who have now
become such travelled authori-
ties on matters of trade, finance
and world affairs would have
scorned to consider “trade”
seriously on the grounds that it
was not “humanitarian.” The
whole thing deserves proper
attention by those who have not
been so fastidious, prejudiced or
just plain dumb as to refuse to
acquaint themselves with the
hard realities of world trade —
including the aspect of home-
production costs.
However, the gesture of inter-
national co-operation is right
enough. Without question pre-
war world trade was in a shock-
ing state, and, since the initial
move in reform seems to rest
with the United States, it is up
to the countries with grievances
to attempt to co-operate, politi-
cal considerations having a very
important bearing upon Wash-
ington’s actions. A genuine
attempt by other countries to
achieve something concrete is
always likely to bring a friendly
political reaction from the great
Republic. Therefore, before
disowning the tariff agreement
entirely at the end of six months,
let us find out where it is wrong
and press for amendments. Even
if King Solomon had been in
the chair at the 1.T.0. confer-
ences it is unlikely that an en-
tirely satisfactory plan would
have been evolved right from
the beginning.
So it is with the World Bank
and International Monetary
Fund arrangements. Difficulties
are bound to arise, and will have
to be straightened out unless the
enterprises are to collapse. That,
of course, should be understood;
success of the whole thing de-
pends upon the skill and good
intent of the representatives of
the nations consulting together.
It is true that Minister E. J.
Ward and some of his followers
have opposed the World Bank
plan right from the start in a
spirit of back-alley distrust.
But Mr. Ward’s monument for
any kind of practical effort on
his part is to be found in the
mess he has brought to New
Guinea.
Latham Withall, director of
the Associated Chamber of
Manufactures, has attacked the
International Trade Organisa-
tion, declaring that, “for all
practical purposes, it was estab-
lished by the State Department
in Washington,” and that it was'
the first step towards imposing
the State Department’s “short-
sighted and retrogressive fiscal
theories” upon British countries,
which together transact nearly
half the total external trade of
the world. A few days later it
was cabled from Washington
that the leader of the U.S. dele-
gation to the 1.T.0., William
Clayton, told Congress during a
debate on the Marshall Plan
that, eventually, British prefer-
ences would be completely
eliminated, with an initial re-
duction as soon as the Marshall
Plan became effective. It is hard
to tell how much is internal poli-
tics and how much is taken
seriously in Washington ex-
ternal-trade and international-
finance manoeuvres. But, in the
long-run, it will do British credit
in the U.S.A. little good if
promises are extorted from the
Empire that later on, through
sheer necessity, have to be
broken. The seeds of future
international discord will be
sown now if the United States
is not prepared to be generous
and farsighted in its inter-
national trading arrangements.
It, more than any other country,
has an economic responsibility
to the world of trade, commerce
and finance.

Strength and stability were
again evident in the Australian
sharemarket last week, with
spectacular rises in North
Broken Hill and B.H. South.
Strength in Barrier shares coin-
cided with President Truman’s
annual economic report to Con-
gress: he spoke of great present
industrial activity and indica-
tions of a 35 p.c. increase in
national output over the next 10
years provided inflation did not
bring about an economic reces-
sion. A little later it was cabled
that a shipment of Australian
lead had been sold in the
United States at above the rul-
ing market price. North ss.
shares rose Bs. 6d., to 91s. 6d.,
and settled at that figure after
minor fluctuations. Souths
jumped 2s. 6d., to 48s. 6d.
North’s last div. was ss. a share.
South’s 4s. 6d. B.H.P. scrip has
been firm at around 575. 9d. for
a couple of weeks ; an increase
in the div. and/or a new issue is
looked for here. Industrial, pas-
toral and base-metal shares have
led in the upward movement of
share prices in 1948. Retail-
store scrip has fallen back a
little.

British experts are interested
in the possibility of bringing
“white coal” (hydro - electric
power) from Norway through
cables laid across the North Sea.
One problem is to find an effec-
tive method of transmitting a.c.
power as d.c. and converting it
back to a.c, at the receiving end.
(There are heavy losses of a.c.
in transmissions over long dis-
tances.) Research is going on in
Britain to overcome the conver-
sion problem following intensive
work in Germany during the war.

☆ ☆ ☆
One Hundred years ago the Royal
Insurance Company first offered Insurance
services to the energetic, enterprising
pioneers of our land.
From that day it has steadily become a
more and more important factor in the life
and commerce of Australia. New facilities
have continually been developed to meet the
needs of the Commonwealth.
Today we look back with pride on a cen-
tury of service to our clients, knowing that
such a record, could be based only on a
foundation of confidence and mutual trust.

From the first pay period in
February the Federal basic wage
will rise by 25., to £5 145., a
week in Sydney, Melbourne’s
base wage goes up by 45., to
£5 135., Hobart’s' by 35., to
£5 10s., Adelaide’s by 25., to
£5 Bs., Brisbane’s by 25., to
£5 75., and Perth’s by Is., to
£5 7s. . These wage-rates are
based on living costs, and are
probably a forerunner of other
rises each quarter during 1948
as the costs-inflation prompted
by the 40-hour week gets into
its stride. Industrial unrest has
not been reduced by the Arbitra-
tion Court’s award of the
shorter working week —in fact,
the Melbourne tram strike arose
out of the method by which the
40 hours are to be worked.
Since the war began the basic
wage has risen by 39 p.c., while
nominal working time has been
reduced by 9 p.c., and actual
working time by more than
that.
The proposal by Federal
Minister Lemmon to establish a
Commonwealth-wide policy for
the sale of State and Federal
houses to tenants appears im-
practicable to Mr. Lyle Moore,
president of the N.S.W. Real
Estate Institute. He quoted
official figures to show that cot-
tages cost from as much as £144
a square in N.S.W. to as little
as £9l a square in Westralia.
“If the sale price of the houses
was to be bqsed on their cost
such variation in State cost levels
would make it impossible to fix
one price level,” said Mr.
Moore. He suggested that each
State fix its own price for dif-
ferent standards of housing at
a level related to building costs
and market value. This might
involve State Governments in
some loss, but the purchasers
would be more fairly treated.
Whatever type of house W.A. is
building for £9l a square, it cer-
tainly puts N. S. Wales to shame
—N. S. Wales, the State which
produces the steel and many of
the other building materials that
have to be carried over 3000
miles to jobs in the West. Little
wonder that a wage of £5 7s, in
Perth buys as much as £5 14s.

December forecasts of new
capital moves by N.Z. Forest
Products, Ltd., have blossomed
into proposals to issue £1,250,000
of 4\ per cent, debentures, with
15 to 20 years’ currency. This
won’t be enough to cover the
first part of the co.’s develop-
ment programme, a mere two
millions; but the co. is coming
to light with the balance of
three-quarters of a million from
internal sources. On the outlay
side are: Pulp mill, £850,000 ;
sawmills, £500,000; wallboard-
mill extension, £175,000; hous-
ing for employees, £126,000;
multi-wall bag plant, £90,000;
working capital, £205,000;
corrugated - container plant,
£40,000 ; total, £1,986,000. De-
bentures will be divided equally
between Maoriland and Aus-
tralia, after allotment of
£250,000 to the Melbourne
underwriters; so there is half a
million for the public on each
side of the Tasman, and they’re
given from January 28 to
February 18 to get in, unless the
directors exercise their right to
shut the door sooner. Sinking-
fund payments will be % per
cent, yearly for five years, and
then 2\ per cent, to maturity.
Further schemes ahead (when
this programme is through) in-
clude building a paper-mill to
draw materials from a plant pro-
ducing kraft pulp from the co.’s
forests. Directors say industries
so far set up afford quickest and
most profitable outlets for trees
at the milling stage, but output
is a long way short of market
demands, in Maoriland and
abroad. If shareholders ask as to
when profits will flow their way
there’s no answer yet. Their
wealth is in land, plant and
forests; it’s a mammoth task to
turn it into dividends.
N.Z. Forest Products earned
£87,872 before setting aside
£50,000 for taxation in the year
to JVlarch 31, 1947, Interest on
the £1,250,000 debenture issue
would call for £56,250 a year,
and would be a charge against
profits (unlike pref. dividends),
thus reducing the liability for
taxation. The one-half per cent,
redemption charge for the first
five years would make total de-
benture charges £62,500 a year,
which should be well covered if
profit-earning keeps stable.
* * * *
Pleased with the flow over*
two years, Maoriland’s’ Govern-
ment is keeping the “tap”
turned on for a third non-stop
loan, on unchanged terms (15
years at 3 per cent.), and for the
same ends; “national develop-
ment and repayment of existing
loans.” There is no easier
borrowing, if it works; and
£39,696,170 invested over-the-
counter in 1946-47 has satisfied
M.L.’s financial “wizards.” Pub-
lic-works programmes haven’t
lacked cash, old debts have been
wiped out, and inflation has had
a channel to spill over. No one
seems to be sure whether there
is any difference between tap-
borrowing and a fixed-dated loan
when it comes to controlling in-
flation, but the Government feels
that in drawing from the tap
it’s “doing what comes
naturally.” There is a governor
on interest, too, as long as funds
are plentiful enough to keep the
tap running. But when funds
get tighter the flow will peter
out unless interest is' lifted.
There are signs of hardening in
interest on the distant horizon.

ARCHIBALD AND
WYNNE.
William Dargie has again
been awarded the Archibald
Prize, this time for a portrait of
knight Marcus Clark; and the
Wynne Prize for landscape
painting goes to Russell Drys-
dale’s “Sofala,” a disenchanting
piece of country - town street
with spidery verandah-posts,
seen in the red glow of a con-
temporary studio mood.
Since nothing is quite so
humanly offensive as success —
particularly continued success—
Dargie’s painting will certainly
be roundly criticised. As a re-
minder that a great period—the
period of Lambert and Long-
staff—has passed, the award is,
perhaps, saddening. But there
were no Lamberts among Dar-
gie’s competitors, and the paint-
ing itself is a sound, straight-
forward —if sober —portrait, in
some ways superior to his por-
trait of L. C. Robson, which
won the prize last year. In the
absence of the grand manner
there are craftsmanship and
composition, technical dexterity,
wary use of flesh-tones, precisely
realistic detail and, in a minor
way, the genuine sparkle of life.
There is character in the face,
but it is not dramatised.
It may be asserted by oppo-
nents of the award that Mr.
Dargie, having previously won
several Archibald Prizes, has
already, so to speak, had his
money’s worth. But that is a
frivolous criticism, more proper
to the world of sport than the
high and serious atmosphere of
art and art galleries. Paintings
are judged on their merits, be-
side their competitors, and in
relation to changeless values.
Painting, like poetry, is not only
a reflection of man’s environ-
ment, but an expression of his
immortality, and has no con-
nection with the fortunes of
racehorses or the popularity of
pugs.
Or has it? For there is evi-
dence of a kind of sporting
generosity a rough-and-ready
see-saw of this school of paint-
ing and that —in awards in the
Wynne and Archibald Prizes
over the past few years. Some-
times it is a conventional
painter; sometimes a “modern-
ist.” Last year Lance Solomon’s
fine “January Weather” won the
Wynne Prize. This year it is
Drysdale’s “Sofala,” and a few
years ago it was Sali Herman’s
“McElhone Stairs,” which in-
troduced a European fashion of
slum painting which Ms spread
and endured to an astonishing
degree.
Considered purely as comedy,
there is something disarming
about the trustees’ curious
duality of mind—a kind of con-
sistent inconsistency. But con-
sidered from a wider viewpoint
the position is more tragic than
Gilbertian. For if there are
good grounds for awarding
Dargie the Archibald Prize there
can be none for Drysdale re-
ceiving the Wynne. And if—
by some impossible distortion of
values —it is right and necessary
for Drysdale to receive the
Wynne Prize, then the Archi-
bald should logically go to
Goodheart’s distinctly amateur-
ish “Don Bradman,” or to J.
Carrington Smith’s ashen-faced
caricature of Professor A. L,
McAuley.
But there were no good
grounds for awarding the prize
to Drysdale, The winner, obvi-
ously, was Lance Solomon’s
“Morning in the Bush,” a de-
lightful oil with bush and light
and color, poetry, and, to
strengthen the poetry and sus-
tain it, the accurate measures of
detail; every stick and blade
which should be observed
painted lightly and plainly, but
never so plainly as to descend to
prose.
If Solomon’s painting is
poetry, then Dargie’s is prose.
But it is good prose, whereas
“Sofala,” at best, is dull. Other
paintings in the Wynne section
were, on the whole, poor. There
were a nice piece of country
road, a shed and a fine warm
gum by Fischer, and a hand-
ful of watercolors, among
which, lacking competition
from more experienced
painters, Rufus Morris’s work
stood out. It is a pity that
the leading Australian water-
colorists do not enter for the
Wynne, for they could raise the
standard considerably. But this
year, if the Wynne had not gone
to Russell Drysdale’s “Sofala”
it would, in all probability, have
gone to Sali Herman’s “Pad-
dington Scene” ; or to something
of the same sort.
On the Archibald end of the
see-saw there were, besides
Dargie’s portrait, two portraits
by Hanke with respectable
claims to consideration. One, of
Lance Solomon, was a fine, mel-
low and competent painting,
rather dark and lacking the
finest observation of character,
but with a pleasing sureness,
almost a slickness, of execution.
Hanke’s other portrait, of Ted
Scorfield, was spirited, rugged,
and again lacking in the inde-
finable fire and finesse that make
great art. Hanks needs less mud
in his paint and more imagina-
tion in his compositions,
Mary Edwards’s “M r s.
Charles Prins” belongs' to a
special category something
quite apart from the solid meat
of Hanke and Dargie, the dull
competence of the majority of
entries and the weirder composi-
tions of beginners and experi-
mentalists. The portrait has
grace, color, dignity—all re-
fleeted and emphasised in a
charmingly indirect way in the
nodding plumed hat, the gay
sleeves and the purplish-dark
sheen of the gown. Here indeed
there is a touch of poetry, yet
paradoxically there is more color
than substance.
Joshua Smith’s “Professor
Harvey Sutton” belongs to the
prose class, good, stern prose,
detailed report but with terrible
enforcement of crimson in the
gown.
Among the mass of paintings,
in both sections, inevitably
worthy, even good paintings are
crowded into corners. Two
paintings by A. D. Colquhoun,
“Miss Jean Whitman” and
“Mavis Jackson,” catch the eye.
The former is more fortunately
situated —beside the Archibald
Prize winner—but, with a sur-
face charm and a charming
length of white gown, is essen-
tially slight. The other, a small
painting, has a dark warmth
under the faintly irritating man-
nerisms of slick brush work.
Of minor paintings there are
many; there is even one of Mr.
Chifley. But there is nothing
with the fire, the poetry and the
special contribution and state-
ment of Lance Solomon’s
“Morning in the Bush.” And it
needs to be sufficiently empha-
sised that the Wynne Prize, after
all, is an award given for Aus-
tralian landscape paintings, with
the intention, implicit if not for-
mally stated, that the prize
should foster both the painting
of Australia and the understand-
ing of it. Poetry and painting
can do that. But Drysdale’s
painting, however charitably
viewed, is not an understanding
—not even an interpretation—
but an attack. A clumsy attack,
true. But the clumsiness only
emphasises the absurdity of atti-
tude of the judging body. And
their solemn see-sawing, taken
in conjunction with the increas-
ing clamor of daily-paper criti-
cism and the huge gullibility of
half-baked public opinion, which
accepts everything labelled
“modern art” as not only art
but modern, cease to be merely
absurd.
In opening Kenneth Rowell’s
show of ballet drawings at
George’s Gallery, Melbourne,
Miss Sally Gilmour remarked
how much she liked the pictures'.
But if the vivid little lady who
can make the most diverse roles
seem real when she dances
looked in the mirror and saw
herself like one of Mr. Rowell’s
strange wooden scarecrows' she
would have a fit of the hysterics.
Fearn Rowntree’s Tasmanian
watercolors at Melbourne Velas-
quez Galleries are pleasant
souvenirs of Hobart, Launces-
ton, Deloraine and other places
with their old stores, mills,
bridges and waterfront shops
dating from an era which was
socially the worst in Australian
history, but when, for some rea-
son or other, convicts built
under the whip more beautifully
than the modern worker does
under shorter hours, high wages
and better economic conditions.

The dispute about Laurence
Olivier’s Old Vic. Company still
seems to be smouldering—the
pother began when Actors’
Equity threatened to stop the
company from playing in Syd-
ney unless (a) a percentage of
the principal roles were given to
Australians, or ( b ) alternative
employment were found for
local players displaced by the
visitors. It was finally announced
that the company would open
at Sydney Tiv. at the conclusion
of the Ballet Rambert season,
which begins next Saturday.
Last Sunday Sydney “Truth” re-
ported a “new arrangement”
under which the current, and
very successful, Cicely Court-
neidge show “Under the
Counter” would move from
J.C.W.’s Sydney Royal to the
Tiv., leaving the former theatre
for the Old Vic. On the follow-
ing day J.C.W.’s general mana-
ger very smartly denied any
such move or any negotiations
with the Tiv. The remarkable
thing about the whole business
is that, while actors and com-
panies are struggling for theatres
in Sydney, the city’s film-houses,
of which there are more than a
dozen and some of which are
suitable for legit., seem to be
battling to get films.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
Last Friday this Letter made one of a
swarm of painters and writers buzzing
around the Archibald prize portrait and
the large company it leads. The portraits
are hung about one of the lower courts
in the Art Gallery, and next-door the
Sulman and Wynne exhibits keep com-
pany. To a woman’s mind the lady in the
pink-satin frock at the top of the room
dominates the show. The satin in that
frock is so luscious, and falls so grace-
fully, that every woman seeing it must
breathe a sigh of envy. One of these
mornings Gallery Director Hal Missing-
ham is likely to come in to find that some
female with a clothes-conscious complex
has nicked off with that frock. Next to
her sits knight Marcus Clark, the winner.
He looks pleased and benevolent as
though thinking: “That’s all right. I’ve
won £4OO for that artist chap Dargie who
always paints to win.” One thing you’ll
have to admit William Dargie has
painted this subject of his nice and clean,
not looking as though he has just emerged
from a mild bath, like some we have seen.
There’s a picture of the Braddon lady
looking handsome and serene, and one
of pianist Beatrice Tange, black-velvet
frock setting off the red-gold of her hair.
And there’s a very elegant Mrs. Prins
painted by Mary Edwards. Nora Heysen
has done a full-length one of father Hans
standing up, which reminds that the Girl
in the Flat Opposite says that all portrait
subjects should stage a “sit-down strike —
far too long to be expected to stand until
the paint and the canvas wear out.”
The Bulletin’s Ted Scorfield is there
with his friendly, direct gaze, and Ben
Chifley, too. Said one woman standing
before the picture: “No matter how they
smooth him out and dolly him up, he
still looks a taxation wolf.”
One of the nicest things about the show
was running into art critic Jimmy Mac-
Donald and prize-winner Bill Dargie just
outside the Gallery. Bill drove Jimmy up
from Melbourne, and, arrived here,
Jimmy was a guest of his old friend
Dattilo Rubbo. The Frank Clunes gave
a lunch for Jimmy and Mr. Dargie last
Friday. Mrs. Macdonald sends greetings
to all Sydney friends.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite has
bought a new outfit in order to acquire
the “new look.” She admits frankly she
doesn’t like it—“too much like going back
to telling the time by sun-dial when you
are used to an electric clock.”
Blinding rain at Randwick last Satur-
day, the first day of the Anniversary
meeting, didn’t keep the girls back. On
the track and in the stands they were to
the fore. Even when the fillies didn’t
win their races they held their own —look
at those glamor girls Sheba and Du
Barry in the Sledmere handicap. It must
be all very encouraging to the Feminists.
Frankly, of course, from a smart social
event point of view, the vista was dis-
tinctly blurred. The stands had a desolate
air, numbers being minus and raincoats
plus. Plastic and nylon raincoats, palely
green, blue, yellow and cyclamen, moved
about above rubber shoes and bootees,
or platform-soled footwear, like an ani-
mated mural in water-colors. Among
well-knowns glimpsed were Sadie Budge,
Biddy McPhillamy, Mrs. Keith Morris,
Mrs. Noel Vincent, Mollie Oxenham.
Sydney Ure Smith loves the city for
which he was named. The affection for
its streets, its Harbor and its buildings,
old and new, has pointed his pencil and
given color to his brush in the drawings
reproduced in The Sydney Book. If
you are one of those who like the past
interwoven with the present, you will
gloat over the reproduction of Butler’s
Stairs leading from Pott’s Point to Wool-
loomooloo. There is a fine sweep in this,
the scene opening out from in the fore-
ground the old Victoria-street steps,
across street and building and tree to
the crowning impressiveness of St.
Mary’s. There are old houses at Miller’s
Point, and there is the quiet beauty of
Elizabeth Bay and the harbor. It’s the
sort of book that would bring a flock of
poets and painters as migrants to these
shores. The originals of almost all the
pictures are in the National Art Galleries
of the different States or in private col-
lections.
Sydney is stepping out of its After
Christmas drowsiness and shaking things
up a bit in preparation for the men of
the U.S. Task Force 38. This is due in
Port Jackson at the end of the week.
Already the Consul-General and Mrs.
Nielsen have arranged a reception for
Saturday late afternoon. The Australian
American Association has sent out cards
for a buffet-lunch in the Trocadero on
February 2. The American National
Club is also busy planning hospitality.
Also there is the Liberty Younger Set
dance at Torch Bearer Headquarters on
Sat., Jan. 31. The American Task Force
has received an invitation through the
American Centre, and the committee,
directed by president Mrs. Mansfield, is
working hard for a great success.
There’s no getting away from these
Celts. The first ballerina with the Marie
Rambert company, to open in Sydney
this Saturday night, is Sally Gilmour. She
got the spring of the heather that’s in her
feet from her Scots parents, and no doubt
her deep feeling for tragedy and comedy
from a long line of Tartan and Piper an-
cestry. In “Lady Into Fox” she is Mrs.
Tebrick, who is so tragically transformed
into a fox. Sally created this part when
she was 17, and it is now so closely
associated with her name that, in the
jargon of the radio world, it has become
her “signature” theme. Those of us who
have read “The Sailor’s Return” and wept
a little over the pathetic “Tulip” are
almost afraid to see her poignant misery
as depicted by Sally. Melbourne audi-
ences were so moved by this ballet that
26 curtains had to be taken. This picture
shows Sally at 26. She celebrated that
birthday in Melbourne last week. She
was born in Singapore.
Saturday’s steady downpour of rain
could not prevent Sydney citizens in their
thousands turning out to say silent fare-
well to Commissioner of Police Mac Kay,
who died suddenly last week. The funeral
service was held in St. Stephen’s Church,
Macquarie-street, The street was crowded
with onlookers, and in the church
itself it is said there were 2000.
Every rank of the service he had com-
manded was represented in the funeral
procession, from mounted police to police
cadets. Through the sodden morning the
Lament played by the Police Pipe Band
sent grieving note. There were masses
and masses of flowers. The State’s highest
and richest and some of its most lowly
were in the procession that moved so
slowly to Taylor-square, passing on its
way Martin-place, where lads from the
Police Boys’ Clubs formed a guard of
honor. The boys were sad knowing they
had lost one of their best friends.
Women members of the Overseas
League are saving their best nylons for
the League’s cocktail party on Friday,
February 13. Guest-of-honor will be
Commander D. C. Kinloch, R.N.
(retired). During the war he commanded
destroyers on Atlantic, Arctic and Medi-
terranean convoys. For his services in
the Arctic he received the D. 5.0., the
0.8. E. was pinned on for his training of
officers, and for his work in the Mediter-
ranean he was mentioned in dispatches.
Commander Kinloch, who is now De-
velopment secretary of the League, and
is on his way, in the Stratheden, to make
a six-months tour of Australia and
Maoriland, will find friends across
the Tasman. Many Enzed seamen gained
their commissions in the training squadron
he commanded in 1943-44. In peace-time
he was flag-lieutenant to the C.-in-C. of
the Home Fleet.
Film-actress Jane Barrett, who arrived
by air to play lead in “Eureka Stockade,”
has a blithe speaking voice, and a pleas-
ing, rather modest manner of telling of
her achievements, under cross-examina-
tion by the interviewer. Last Sunday
night over the A.B.C. she played lead in
“The First Joanna,” the play which won
the 1947 Playwrights’ Advisory Board’s
prize of £75. The writer is Dorothy
Blewett, of Melbourne. Jane, who is
just 24, was married last September.
Husband is artist Hans Helweg. She
goes to Singleton this week to start work
on “Eureka Stockade,” in which she is
cast as the pretty school-teacher with an
18-inch waist. Slender and all as she is,
brown-haired Jane has to make use of
an ingenious bit of corsetry called a
“waist nipper” to get this result.
From Melbourne
Almost 1000 dancers came to St. Kilda
Town Hall when the third-year nurses
of the Royal Melbourne Hospital held
a ball in aid of their nominee. Nurse
Elizabeth McCutcheon, who now be-
comes an entrant in the War Nurses’
Memorial Centre search for a queen.
Other queens in the contest present at
the ball were Staff Nurse Pat Mc-
Naughton, Nurse Judith Slaney (second-
year nurse’s representative) and Rose-
mary Elliott (first year). Elizabeth, who
was chosen during the evening, has
already raised £9OO for the appeal.
Among the dancers were Jill Tolley,
whose floral skirt was worn with a white
blouse, and Sue Annear, who was in
blue. Lynette Lee, a very pretty nurse
at Royal Melbourne, chose a white-
brocaded satin gown. Audrey Balmer,
who was in charge of the lucky enve-
lopes, wore a deep-amethyst taffeta
gown ; a pleated frill at the hem of the
slim skirt and a pleated fold outlining
the sleeveless bodice were attractive
trimming. Elizabeth McCutcheon pinned
white ostrich feathers in her hair and
wore a white georgette gown. Among
guests in the official party were Dr. A. E.
Coates and Mrs. Coates, she in a blue
full-skirted evening gown, and Mr. and
Mrs, Massey Burnside ; the latter wear-
ing a deep japonica-pink satin gown, the
skirt featuring full drapes.
On the same night the nurses of
Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital held a
dance at 203 Domain-road in aid of their
candidate, Sister (“Mickey”) Syer, who is
an ex-p.-0.-w, Mickey looked very
charming in an aqua-blue crepe gown
with a full sunray-pleated skirt. Presi-
dent of the committee, Matron Lucy
Edwards, wore a floral georgette gown.
The secretary. Sister Betty Riley, chose
black taffetas. Colored butterflies winged
their way over the black taffeta worn by
treasurer Sister Wilson* Hay. Sister Sheila
Leonard’s amber- and white-striped cot-
ton gown was white-braided on the skirt.
Among the dancers were Dr. and Mrs,
Gavin Flannagan ; her white crepe sleeve-
less gown had a draped skirt. Mrs. Ray,
wife of Major Ray, O.C. Heidelberg,
topped her white-crepe skirt with pink
and silver lame,
Madge Ryan, playing the role of
Birdie Hubbard in “The Little Foxes,”
the Independent production now at the
Princess, was born in Townsville (Q.). In
private life she is Mrs, Michael Rundle,
has a small daughter of eight, her home
being at Epping, a rural setting on Syd-
ney’s outer fringe, Madge, who is' tall
and slim with an engaging manner, has
toured under the Firm’s banner with
John Nugent Hayward in “The Patsy,”
“Fresh Fields” and “Claudia.” For the
past six years she has been a member
of the Independent Co. and is also well
known for her radio work. Photo by

Racegoers to the Moonee Valley
meeting organised for the War Nurses’
Memorial Centre appeal revelled in the
glorious sunshine and soft, cool breeze
and the summer ensembles which they
had almost given up hope of airing.
Pastel blues, pinks and greens fashioned
frocks in many designs, and the large
white straw hat was well in evidence.
White frocks were few; blue was the
predominant shade. The two-toned shoe
still holds its popularity; the single-
toned ranged through every color in the
spectrum. Not so happily chosen were
black frocks, agleam with sequins and
others with “the new look.” The hot sun
brought sparkle to the sequins, but frocks
of this type should really be confined to
the cocktail hour. Buttoned cotton
dresses were, with white accessories, just
right for the day. Most of the frocks
featured very full skirts, achieved either
with unpressed pleats or flares.
The Hon. Mary Rous was frocked in
blue ; her sister, the Hon. Penelope Rous,
chose a blue floral frock. Their mother,
Lady Stradbroke, wore a sheer black
frock with a small natural-straw hat
trimmed with beige and green chiffon to
form scarf-ends. An unusual hat was
worn by Mary Morris with her navy-and-
white sheer jacket suit; of navy straw,
the white crown was banded in brighter
blue velvet, while the tail-ends were gold-
studded and a gold chain looped across
to hold the two ribbon ends together.
Shirley Watts was in navy and white,
her small navy hat featuring bows of
navy and white in front. Barbara Sel-
leck’s frock was light blue and white, a
wreath of white flowers forming her head-
wear. With Col. Ralph Michaelis was
his wife, whose black sheer frock fea-
tured a very full skirt of the new length ;
her wide-brimmed pastel-green straw hat
was trimmed with green satin ribbon and
roses.
Julia Mary Rouse chose pastel-pink
linen strictly tailored. Mrs. Theo
Lewis’s frock was of cinnamon-
brown linen, the skirt full and
flared, the bodice carrying a deep
shoulder fichu and tiny bows sewn from
the shoulder to the waistline ; her large
white chip straw hat was trimmed with
emerald velvet ribbon, Mrs. A. G.
Warner chose an ensemble of greige
crepe ; her small hat of lime-green straw
was trimmed with matching taffeta with
an edging of black-and-white checks.
Mrs. P. Mace topped her pastel-pink
frock with a navy straw hat edged with
pink. Helen Hill! Smith’s gaily-patterned
silk frock was worn with a white hat.
Her mother, Mrs. Robert Lane, was smart
in navy blue and white. The jacket of
Mrs. George Formby’s royal-blue suit had
white trimming to match her small white
hat. Mrs. Robert Young’s pale-mauve
sequined frock and matching gloves
were worn with a large shady white hat.
The first exhibition of watercolors
held here by Fearn Rowntree, an Infant
Mistress Inspector in the Tasmanian Edu-
cation Department, was opened by
Leonard Mann, author of Flesh in
Armor. There were a few Tasmanians
on hand to lend their support to the
artist, among them Ida Quigley, Art
Director of the Hobart Teachers’ College,
and Irma Bull, a member of the A.B.C.
orchestra in Hobart. Fearn’s brother
Edward was also at the opening. Other
interested onlookers included Anne Rod-
gers, who wore a black coat over her
beige frock and off-the-face beige hat,
Mrs. Hickman, who with her husband,
the new headmaster of Cary Grammar
School, has just arrived from Tasmania,
Mesdames Arthur Salmon, Charles
Bryant, in aqua-blue suit and white hat,
and A. Bilscarrow, the latter with her
sisters Peggy and Kathleen.
St. John’s Church of England, Toorak,
was the venue of a double wedding;
that of Susan Jane and Robert, daughter
and son of Robert Hamilton, M.L.A.,
and Mrs. Hamilton, of Toorak. Susan,
the elder daughter, was married to Bruce
Alan, only son of Dr and Mrs. Rupert
Hyett, of Geelong. Her gown was of
white brocaded satin, and the long tulle
veil was crowned with white roses.
Bridesmaids Margaret Kent Hughes and
Shirley Hyett were frocked in sky-blue
crepe. Robert’s bride was Patricia,
youngest daughter of Mrs. I. G. Swin-
dells, of London. Her gown was of white
Swiss embroidered muslin, and her veil
was held in place with stephanotis. Her
attendant was her sister, Mrs. N. J.
Morgan, whose gown was also of sky-blue
crepe. The reception was held at the
near-by Hamilton home. Mrs. Hamilton,
whose frock of cornflower-blue French
sheer was worn with a small hat trimmed
with matching panne velvet, with her
husband received the guests, who in-
cluded R. G. Menzies, who proposed the
toast to the young Hyett couple, and W.
S. Kent Hughes, who performed the same
service for Rob Hamilton and his bride.
Mrs. Swindells was unable to be present
at the wedding, for she left London for
Australia just a week ago, being unable
to catch an earlier boat. Weddings could
not be postponed, for the Hyetts have
booked for London and will leave shortly,
while Rob had to get back to his job in
the Department of External Affairs at
Canberra.
Sally Gilmour, of the Ballet Rambert,
confessed in opening Ken Rowell’s ex-
hibition of drawings that it was the first
time she had found herself in such a role.
But Sally did quite well and said she was
captivated with the fantasy and imagin-
ative qualities of Ken’s work ; especially
in the* designs for ballet. Sally’s black
frock was cut on simple lines, and her
bonnet-shaped hat was finished with
ruched taffetas on top of the brim.
George’s Gallery was well filled for the
opening day, and members of the Ballet
Rambert present included Margaret Scott
and Walter Gore. Sydney visitor Mrs.
L. Fischer was in a suit of hunter’s-green
corduroy velvet, and her small white-felt
hat was trimmed with green pompons.
Reta Findlay’s outsized hat of grey lacey
straw was worn with a pastel-pink frock ;
her unusual bracelets were of pink and
blue shells.


THE SERVICE MAN
THE SINGAPORE REPORTS.
“Ek Dum”: The first of the
commanders’ reports on the
Singapore campaign has been
issued. Air-Marshal Sir Robert
Brooke-Popham, who bore the
burden of the anxious time be-
fore the Japanese, attacked, tells
his story in 40,000 words.
Having had to deal with the
Australian Governments mainly
before “Labor” came into
power, he speaks well of their
co-operation. He did not have
to suffer much of the period of
vacillation and panic which
affected Canberra after the pre-
sent crowd reached office. He
praises also the Dutch, who
openly showed which side they
would be on long before the
fight began, making their air-
fields available to our R.A.A.F.
and co-operating in every way.
His polite praise of Australia,
however, does not alter the fact
that Singapore was our affair
even more than Britain’s; that
if we had sent three divisions
there in 1940 as we could have
done and if we had had a Navy
and an Air Force commensurate
with the stake involved Singa-
pore would have been a differ-
ent story.
It is worthy of notice that the
people who did most to prevent
this consummation —the present
party in power at Canberra —
were also the pnes most
abusive of the British, whose
shores had been under fire daily
for over two years when the
Pacific War broke out and who
had been defending the whole
world’s communications, for not
providing the means of defence.
There is very little new in the
Brooke-Popham report, which
covers the period October 17,
1940, to December 27, 1941.
But it contains some remark-
able statements. One was that
until the end of November, 1941,
the British war leaders did not
believe that Japan might be on
the verge of starting war.
This will surprise a lot of ob-
servers.
It is certain that the Ameri-
cans knew the chances. The posi-
tion seems to have been that by
agreement Japan was considered
as a United States responsibility
and the United States fell down
on the intelligence side. The
KumSu mission momentarily
blinded them to the imminent
danger, with the result that.they
were caught unprepared.
This is an inconceivable posi-
tion in the light of the know-
ledge of the facts which have
since been published by the
United States War Department.
The department had known,
through the breaking of a
Japanese code, of the general
plans of Tokyo since the pre-
vious July.
The cold truth was that Singa-
pore, whose defences were based
upon a conception in which it
would be the kernel of United
States naval defence in the west,
was faced with a “command of
the sea greater than we ever an-
ticipated.”
It is unfortunate that in telling
their stories commanders are
limited not merely to what is
within their vision. They are
bound to what is within their
personal concern.
Air-Marshal Brooke-Popham’s
version of what took place in
the days before the actual inva-
sion and • the discovery of
Japanese convoys by the Hud-
sons of No. 1 R.A.A.F. squad-
ron at the limit of their patrol
range is therefore far from
complete, and places' the British
command in a worse light than
it need be. And the same applies'
to some subsequent events.
There is little doubt from the
report what the reasons for the
fall of Malaya were. Even
allowing for underestimation of
Japanese military capacity under
Malayan conditions, there is no
question that the deciding fac-
tor was overwhelming weight of
Japanese resources on the spot,
in the air, at sea and on land.
Singapore might have held
out a little longer than it did,
but iq the end the result would
have been the same.
When war broke out the
actual deficiency in air-defence
requirements was 400 in num-
bers—nearly three-quarters of
the total need on service esti-
mates. And without air support
neither battleships nor small
naval craft were much use.
The Army was short by 17
battalions of the force required
to complete the defence plan ;
short also by four ack-ack regi-
ments and two tank regiments.
There were no tanks and few
armored cars.
And the reason for this was
not negligence. It was mainly/
desperate European needs. In
equipment almost everything
which was vital for Singapore
and the Far East was being sent
to Russia, whose Communists
immediately showed their grati-
tude by using the Singapore
campaign as an evidence that
the British were a cowardly and
incompetent mob.
It is neither fair nor possible
to fully review the Singapore
affair without the reports of all
concerned. When these are
available they will be dealt with
at length in these pages.
Murder Will Out.
“Ek Dum”: “Revelations” by
the United States State Depart-
ment and a following speech by
Mr. Bevin in the House of
Commons both show how des-
perate the situation between the
Western Powers and Russia is
and was in 1940.
It also illustrates the need to
deal urgently with the Com-
munist party in Australia before
it is too late.
"Mr. Bevin has attacked the
Russians for their territorial am-
bitions, and the most serious part
of his speech is that in which
he admits that the frontiers
of the U.S.S.R. and Communism
have shifted west as far as the
Elbe. He seems to admit in fact
that Eastern Germany, Poland
and the Balkan countries have
been swallowed up completely.
They are now Russian colonies
at best and, at worst, integral
parts of Russia, though some of
them don’t know it yet. And
stiil Stalin and his greedy off-
siders are not satisfied and are
prepared to plunge the rest of
Europe in anarchy to achieve
their ends.
The documents issued in
Washington “for the enlighten-
ment of American and world
opinion” confirm what was al-
ready long and strongly de-
duced on the basis of Russian
actions and Communist propa-
ganda: In every country in the
world in 1940 the Communist
party was a traitor organisation
working for the Nazis under in-
structions from Moscow and
from the Comintern (General
Secretary, Dmitrov), which had
its headquarters in Vienna. The
papers have been extracted from
the official files of the German
Foreign Office covering the
period from August 23, 19 59, to
the invasion of Russia in June,
1941.
Helping Germany
In them Washington State De-
partment writes a necessary foot-
note which explains and eluci-
dates the position in a way which
has never been done before. It
shows clearly that the pro-
gramme advocated by Comrade
Stalin and by his agents in Aus-
tralia and elsewhere was a
plan designed in collaboration
with Hitler for the defeat and
dismemberment of the British
Commonwealth and France, not
to mention the Americas.
It was agreed between those
two convenable thugs, Molotov
and Hitler, that the world should
be split into Russian, German
and Japanese spheres of influ-
ence.
South of the Soviet Union in
the direction of the Indian
Ocean was to be a Russian
sphere of territorial aspirations.
This explains a great deal. It
explains why the Australian
Communist newspapers devoted
spa ? e to lfi e denuncia-
, • "ish A ulll India. It
7 hy * Australian Com-
mumsts devoted so much time
in 1939 to espousing the cause
of lascar seamen whom they
lured into winm wartime
mrea into serious war-time
strikes and the insistence of their
demands thai inHionc T-.-co
mands that Indians should rise
and rub the nose of the British
lion in the dust it evninins
fi m dust - , 11 , explains
further, perhaps, why the Com-
mumst party in Australia is so
interested in getting the Dutch
out of Indonesia and securing
Leftist control over it.
Next, Russia demanded the
right to include the Persian oil
and Eastern Turkey in her
This was at the time when
Australian Communists were
engaged in a vigorous anti-
recruiting campaign-led by two
men who have been placed by
the present Government in high
positions in which they have
access to many a Cabinet secret
concerning defence—to persuade
young Australians not to enlist
on the ground that they were
not to be used to fight Germans
and Italians, but to invade
Russia through the Caucasus,
“That makes me two up”
Moscow was quite evidently
looking for a pretext to seize
Persia down to Bahrein, as it
had just seized the Baltic States.
After the fall of France, when
Communists were urging revolt
in London and a shameful peace
with Hitler on the lines of
Lenin’s precedent, and when an
Australian Communist - party
branch was caught collecting
military information to send
abroad and disseminating advice
written in Vienna to its branches,
Stalin was ready to recognise the
Mediterranean as Mussolini’s
Mare Nostrum, if Italy would
do the same in respect of the
Black Sea —a proposal which
would have spelt the complete
end of Turkey.
And, finally, the position of
the Soviet Union at that time
was clearly defined by an official
message from Stalin to Hitler
conveying the former’s “warmest
congratulations on the splendid
success of the German armed
forces” in the west. These suc-
cesses were against British
soldiers, British and Australian
airmen and the French, Nether-
landers, Belgians, Danes and
Norwegians.
It is noteworthy that in De-
cember, 1941, Moscow did not
contradict the statement made
by Tokyo Radio that a repre-
sentative of the Soviet Union
Embassy had called at the Jap-
anese Foreign Office to convey
Stalin’s congratulations on the
sinking of the Prince of Wales
and Repulse and the shooting-
down of Australians and other
British airmen in Malaya—this
at a time when Russia was an
“ally” shouting greedily that
every other war activity should
be dropped by Britain and the
United States to open a second-
front against Hitler.
War Material for Hitler
The break between the two
power-mad thieves of Middle
and Eastern Europe and Asia did
not come until large quantities
of war materials had been sent
from Russia to Germany, until
Russian ports had been used as
German submarine bases.
It did not come because of the
shortcomings of Hitler so much
as the insatiable rapacity of
Stalin, who wished for
“security”— i.e., control —in the
Balkans and Finland, which the
Germans were not prepared to
concede.
Stalin then treated his German
allies much as he is now treating
the British and Americans,
whose sacrifices for his starving
and—until they fed him with
huge war supplies beaten
country cost them dearly.
Stalin throughout showed con-
tempt for Britain: “The British
Army is weak and the Navy no
longer deserves its previous
reputation.” He told Matsuoka
in March, 1941, that Russia
never got along well with the
British, and Ribbentrop that “if
Great Britain dominated the
world it was due to the stupidity
of other countries which had
allowed themselves to be
bluffed.”
He himself was all in favor of
bluff, and quarrelled with Hitler’s
proposed joint German-Russian
communique on the division of
Poland as being too frank be-
cause it presented the facts all
too plainly. Molotov demanded
that the Russian part of the
move should be represented to a
deluded world as an heroic move
by the crusading Soviets to
rescue Ukrainians and White
Russians burning to return to
their fatherland from the blood-
drunk clutches of the reactionary
Polish landlords,
Australian Activities
All this squares well with
Communist propaganda in Aus-
tralia.
In October, 1939, the Com-
munist party in Australia issued
a pamphlet written by the Bul-
garian revolutionary Dmitrov,
Secretary-General of the Comin-
tern!, and a colleague on the ex-
ecutive of Comrade Sharkey.
This effusion, which was issued
so suddenly after the Russians
seized Poland that there was
little doubt about its having
been here in cold-storage when
war broke out, quotes on its
opening page an interview which
Comrade Stalin had given to
Mr. Roy Howard, of the Scripps-
Howard Syndicate, in which the
Comrade “stressed that the chief
cause of the war lies in capi-
talism, in its imperialist, pre-
datory manifestations”:
You remember [he said to Mr.
Howard] how the first world war
arose. It arose out of the desire to
subdivide the world. Today we
have the same background Capi-
talism in its imperialist phase is a
system which considers war to be
a legitimate instrument for settling
international disputes
Mr. Dmitrov in 1939 opined
that “events of the recent period
completely confirm the correct-
ness of these far-sighted warn-
ings by Comrade Stalin” and also
“testify to the timeliness of the
tenacious efforts of the Com-
munist International for the
establishment of a powerful
fighting - front against war”—
i.e., at that stage, against war
directed to defeat Hitler, who
had invited the Comintern to
establish its headquarters in
Nazi territory at Vienna.
Common Treachery
Not merely were Britain and
France condemned by Dmitrov
as imperialist warmongers for
continuing to wage war against
Hitler, who had divided Poland
with Russia, but the U.S. was
accused of being the chief sup-
plier of war material to Imperi-
alist Japan. It was held that
“the responsibility for the war
lies with the bourgeoisie of the
capitalist countries, and prim-
arily with the ruling classes of
the belligerent States.” It was set
out that Germany was faced
with the dilqmma of going to
war with the U.S.S.R. as an
underling of British - French
imperialism, or making a de-
cisive turn in its foreign policy,
and taking the path of peaceful
relations with the Soviet Union.
Germany (he says) chose the
second path;
The British and French imperi-
alists _ miscalculated [wrote the un-
prescient Comrade Dmitrov], They
staked on an anti-Soviet war and
lost. The Soviet Union, conducting
socialist foreign policy, by conclud-
ing a non-aggression pact with Ger-
many, frustrated the insidious plans
of the provokers of war, ensured
peace between the two largest States
in Europe [Russia and Germany]
The bourgeoisie of Britain and
France turned to the path of armed
straggle against their chief imperialist
rival [Germany], They did this under
the pretext of defending their vassal,
reactionary landlord Poland By
concluding the German-Soviet amity
treaty, the U.S.S.R. not only elimi-
nated the immediate danger of war
for its peoples, but also created a
barrier against the extension of the
imperialist war.
How great a barrier was
proved 18-odd months after-
wards when Moscow was yell-
ing to the imperialists to save
it from their blood-drunk allies,
who had broken not only
through the “German-Soviet
amity treaty,” but through the
“barrier” which Comrade Stalin
allegedly had created agaiqst the
extension of imperialist war.
However, Comrade Dmitrov
urged that “the one correct stand
for the (Australian) working-
class was an irreconcilable,
courageous struggle against im-
perialist war, a struggle against
the culprits and the agents of
this war primarily in their own
country, a struggle to end this
predatory war.... — by sur-
render to Hitler.
The Communist party of
Australia did its utmost to carry
out the instruction, using every
means within its power to pre-
vent the development of
munitions manufacture, seeking
to discredit the British Govern-
ment, seeking to persuade mili-
tary recruits that they were
being enlisted to attack Russia,
using every pretext to create
strikes and breakdowns in muni-
tions factories and to hold up
shipping.
Comrade Stalin in a special
speech on Nov. 7, 1939, urged
Communist parties everywhere
to do their part by overthrow-
ing their Governments and
systems violently, and telling
them that they could look on
Moscow as a base for their
revolutionary operations, on
which they could rely. Mos-
cow he claimed was a
powerful and open centre of the world
revolutionary movement that it never
possessed before and around which it
can now rally, organise and unite the
revolutionary front of the proletarians
and of the oppressed nations of all
countries against imperialism.
Every line of the published
documents tends to add evidence
of how right Mr. Churchill was
when he declared on January 20,
1940, that “Communism rots the
soul of a nation and makes it
abject and hungry in peace, base
and abominable in war,”
It is no wonder that the Rus-
sians found it so easy to get on
with the Army of Von Paulus
after their capture at Stalingrad.
The Nazis of Stalingrad and the
Nazis of the Kremlin were all
boys together, speaking the
same language of treachery.

This box makes weather to order! It’s one of
the big reasons why Goodyear Tyres give good
service in both hot and cold climates. The
flexomeler, as it’s called, can create temperatures
ranging from 32°F. below zero to more than 212°F.
In such extremes of heat and cold, it rapidly flexes
strips of tread, carcase and side-wall rubber gives
them the kind of stretch and strain they would get
in tyres on your car. This punishing test makes
sure nothing goes into Goodyear Tyres but tough
materials that will take the punishment of both heat
and cold long after lesser tyres fail.
Here is just one more reason why Goodyear Tyres
have been the world’s first choice
for 33 years.

WfHEN you try your luck at a shooting gallery
you start a chemical reaction. The rim at the
back of the cartridge contains a very sensitive
explosive called the “priming.” When the trigger
is pressed, the firing pin of the rifle strikes the rim
of the cartridge and explodes the priming which
in its turn ignites the propellant charge in the
cartridge. The short rimflre .22 cartridge—the one
generally used in shooting galleries—contains little
more than one thousandth of an ounce of propellant,
but when ignited its temperature rises to nearly
5000 deg. F. It decomposes into a mixture of gases
and expands sufficiently to fill a pint mug three-
quarters full. This sudden expansion drives the
bullet from the rifle. The British
chemical industry provides the marks-
man with his lead bullets, copper cart-
ridge cases, priming and propellants.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
In one thing particularly Mel-
bourne racing has it all over that
of other States: the number of meet-
ings held in aid of charities. Satur-
day’s Moonee Valley meeting was for
the Memorial Centre which is to
honor Victorian nurses who died in
the war. Attendance excellent and
conditions perfect.
Features of the day’s racing were
the successes of owner O. R. Porter
and of the progeny of imported St.
Magnus; three winners each and
some places. Standing at G. R.
Nicholas’s Shirley Park Stud (Vic.),
St. Magnus is a son of the English
Derby winner Sansovino and the One
Thousand Guineas winner Fair Isle;
his parents between them won well
over £30,000 in stakes.
First winner for St. Magnus (and
Porter) was the outstanding two-year-
old Scotwyn (R. Heather), carrying
a rather lenient topweight of 9.4 to
comfortably defeat Head Mistress and
Blessing in the first Niddrie Handi-
cap of five furlongs. Not a race for
the small punter, with the books
calling “I’ll take threes!”
Another St. Magnus, Gay Saint,
carried topweight and started favorite
for the second Niddrie, but was sur-
prisingly easily beaten by the Helios
colt Nauplia (J. Purtell). Dawson
(St. Magnus-Palmy) was third by
evidence of the camera, in use for
the first time at Moonee.
Porter scored again with his old
New Zealand-bred gelding High Play,
tossing Audacity and Hawa Rani in
the first Magdala Highweight. A
tiptop effort on the part of the win-
ner, who, with a slug of 10.2, con-
ceded Audacity 161 b. and the others
more, and, winning by two lengths,
equalled the course record of 1.12
for the odd distance of six furlongs
and 20yds. The second leg of the
Highweight went to Sandy Bay (B.
Sellars), with Aggressor and Mexican
Champagne in the places. Curious
name for a horse, Mexican Cham-
pagne, but apt enough; he’s by
Aztec from Market Merry.
Denhoti was' the Porter candidate
for the main event, the William Reid
Stakes, but he failed by something
less than a length to hold the Derby
runner-up, Chanak, making a re-
appearance after a spell; Galway
Pipe was third. Chanak, too, equalled
the course record of 1.12.
1
Yet another St. Magnus, Orthodox
came out on top in the Cranmallan
Handicap, a 13-furlongs test of
stamina, and a poor result for most
punters. Second was Queen of the
Fairies, like the winner a 10-to-l
chance, and third the favorite Stene-
laus, another of Porter’s.
Almost incredibly, the final race of
the day, the mile Caldermeade Handi-
cap, saw both Porter and St. Magnus
again successful —represented this time
by the stable champion St. Fairy (H.
Badger), lumping 9.7 to down. Law
Case and William Tell. Over the
afternoon Porter won £1560 in stakes
and progeny of St. Magnus altogether
took £1720. Total prizemoney dis-
tributed was £6500.

Facing about the limit in miserable
weather for racegoing, a very slender
crowd at Randwick on Saturday was
rewarded by seeing hot favorite Gay
Monarch (W. Cook) take the Chal-
lenge Stakes. Last most of the way,
Gay Monarch commenced to move
up at the turn and sustained a power-
ful run to win comfortably from
Heroic Sovereign and Earl Pentheus.
Reflecting the state of the rain-sodden
track, Gay Monarch took 1.14 for
the six furlongs—-slowest time re-
corded since Captivation clocked 1.15
in 1933. It was Cook’s fourth Chal-
lenge win.
Second to Brazier in last year’s
Challenge, Gay Monarch is a six-year-
old son of Coronation Day, himself
a son of that remarkable old horse
Coronach, still at stud in N.Z. de-
spite having won the English Derby
more than twenty years ago.
Darby Munro has probably come
in for even more abuse than most
riders are accustomed to stopping
at times, but he proved a great friend
to punters on Saturday, having three
mounts for three wins on well-
fancied horses.
It should have been a happy after-
noon for Munro, but stewards took
the joy out of it by ordaining two
months’ suspension. After winning
the First Paddington Highweight on
Fra Diavolo (one to remember when
the going is soft), Munro survived
a protest entered by the rider of
imported Cursory (second), but after
lengthy inquiry was found guilty of
interference to the third horse,
Burnley.
Munro also won the second leg
of the Paddington on the Newcastle
performer Last Bowl, downing
Souvenir and Brilen. His other
winner was the oft-disappointing
Shading, in the mile Valicare Handi-
cap for three-year-old fillies. Odds-
en favorite Nizam’s Ring finished
second last —an effort too bad to be
true. Her owner, F. W. Hughes, said
that but for arriving at the course
too late he would have scratched her
because of her tidy weight, the heavy
going and her being recently off-color.
In other events a couple of 10-to-l
chances obliged the bookies: Jacern
(F. Williams) downing Crosby and
Simpkin in the Two-year-old, while
lightly-weighted three-year-old Royal
Lad (A. Podmore) beat Debenture,
Menelik and others
in the 10-furlongs
January Handicap.
* *
Conditions being
good, handicappers’
judgments proved
sound in early events
of the Anniversary
Day meetings at
both Flemington
and Randwick. At Flemington top-
weights won the first and second
events —Azores the Hurdle; Ungar
the six-furlongs sprint for two-year-
olds. The Australia Day Cup went to
Sanctus, one of the lightweights,
downing Black Law and Oatcake.
At Randwick, second topweight,
Wattle, won the first race from top-
weight Grey Nurse; Jacern and
Steady, both topweights, took the
next two events. The bottom line
had its turn in the Australia Day
Handicap, Smooth Action, on the
limit, downing second topweight Gay
Monarch. The other leg of the day’s
double, the 12-furlongs Anniversary
Handicap, was won by topweight
Crusader, leading practically all the
way and getting there by a head
fr.om second topweight Kerry Lad.

Shannon was beaten into third
place in his first American race,
finishing on well over the seven fur-
longs. His real test will be the Santa
Anita Handicap on February 28.

Calling at Mount Gambier to
annihilate a South Aus. Country XI
by an innings and 106 runs, the
Indian tourers invaded Adelaide for
the fourth Test and shortly saw that
poor old has-been Bradman (vide
ex-cricketer sports scribes last season)
hit up another double century, plus 1.
It made Bradman’s 37th double cen-
tury in first-class cricket another
record; one better than Hammond.
Barnes staying with him for 112, the
first day’s play ended with Australia
3 down for 370.
Hassett sticking there for the rest
of the innings (for 198 not out; his
highest in a Test), and Miller con-
tributing a stylish 67, the Australian
score mounted to 674 (highest for a
Test in Australia). Then India began
in the worst possible fashion: 2 down
for 6; Sarwate and Sen bowled by
Miller with the last two balls sent
down on Saturday.
On the excellent principle that it’s
best to go down fighting, Amarnath
started off on Monday as if the
scores had been the other way round.
He went well for a while, too; get-
ting into the forties before Bradman
caught him off Johnson. But the
position was plain hopeless.
Bill Brown got going at last in the
Q. v. S.A. Sheffield Shield match, his
second-innings *83 (not out) helping
Queensland to win by four wickets.
Q., 331 and 6 for 209; S.A., 262
and 277.

The Wallabies, in their last en-
counter in France, beat He de France,
30-12; a crowd-pleasing, open game.
Howell, who scored two tries, was
elusive and forceful, playing one of
his best attacking games. The Wal-
labies’ next match is at Cardiff,
against the Barbarians.

Here for the National Athletic
championships, Jamaican Herb Mc-
Kenley has been feeling one of the
disadvantages of long-distance air-
transport —the almost overnight com-
plete change of climatic and other
conditions is no good for the highly-
trained athlete. Holder of the world
record for 440yds., McKenley suffered
his first defeat over that distance,
John Bartram winning the title by
"Well, lose it again!”
four yards. Eighteen-year-old Morris
Curotta ran a grand race till he
stumbled and fell near the finish.
Bartram was in great form, also run-
ning Treloar to an inch or so in the
100yds., with McKenley third. Against
McKenley, also, was the fact of our
national championships being con-
tested on turf; cinder tracks are
standard anywhere else in the world.
On Monday Treloar added the 220
to his record.

Biggest upset in the Australian
championships at Kooyong was
the quarter-final success of veterans
Harry Hopman and Jack Crawford
against Brown-Dart; in the semi they
went down to Bromwich-Quist. The
other doubles finalists were Colin
Long and our best youngster, Frank
Sedgman. The final produced prima
donna displays from all except
Sedgman, who played correspond-
ingly better tennis, though under the
strain of the occasion he netted an
easy shot when holding match point.
In fact, he and Long dropped three
match points, after which Bromwich-
Quist (mainly Bromwich, with Quist
trying to detect some hidden flaw in
his racket) recovered, took the set,
and the remaining two sets of the
match.

Australia’s “icebergs,” who go in
for mid-winter plunges in the sea, are
made look a bit sissy by the English
variety. As reported by the “Times,”
London’s “icebergs” disport in the
Serpentine, in which ditch the tem-
perature was “unusually high” round
Christmas-time at 44deg. But that’s
the least of the Serpentine “icebergs’ ”
worries: “One foggy morning one
of them lost his sense of direction
while out in the middle of the pond.
Fortunately friends heard his calls
and guided him back by means of
electric torches. Another man was
in the habit of diving from the top
board, a distance of 33ft. A deeply
religious man, he used to write out
a prayer which he carried down with
him when visibility was such that
he could not see the water or any-
thing that might be on the surface.”

Taxes, according to an American
boxing writer, are what keep Joe
Louis fighting: he’s out of funds
when they fall due and has to fight
to raise the wind. No one, says
the same scribe, ever saw Joe swag-
gering up to the bar, throwing down
a bankroll and shouting in the fashion
of his prodigal predecessor John L.
Sullivan; but Joe has his ways of
getting rid of it: “His personal
charities, which he prefers kept sec-
ret, run into big sums. He is ex-
tremely generous in gifts to his
friends and open-handed toward his
family. He never says no to financing
sports for negroes: his bills for
trophies run heavy. He doesn’t stint
in personal expenses, and the only
diversion on which he doesn’t bet is
fights.”
Archie Kemp (9.9£) got there on
points against Les Fuller (9.9 J) at
Melbourne Stadium. A tough fight,
and nothing much between ’em.
Experience helped former amateur
champ. Billy de Belin (10.6 i) in the
early stages of his Leichhardt scrap
with Harry Hayes (10.7), but, fighting
better all the way, Hayes won it
well on points. Hayes is country-
bred —hailing from Griffith (N.S.W.)
—and is young and tough. Teacher-
mapager Jack Dunleavy a good
judge thinks he’s another Jack
Haines.


ABORIGINALITIES
V
“Old-timer”: Warroo Walters had been
20 years in the back-country without a
break when he won a £lOO lottery-prize
and decided to have a holiday by the
sea. He blew into a N.S.W. South Coast
resort in the casual way of the bushman
and discovered that in these days accom-
modation has to be booked months ahead.
Warroo absorbed a few beers at the pub,
cogitated, then turned to his dog. “You
an’ me has camped out before, Sooner,”
he said, “an’ we can do it again.” So he
bought a tent and camp-gear, fishing-lines,
etc., and wandered round till he found a
secluded little bay on the estuary. Next
morning he looked out of his tent to see
a young woman in her birthday-suit run-
ning along the beach, chased by a second,
similarly unclad, while a third, with a
towel round her middle, brought up the
rear, Warroo eyed this phenomenon until
the maidens disappeared; then he made
a hurried breakfast, folded his tent, went
to the station and caught the first train
going outback. “Yair,” he told the crowd
in the Dingo Crossing hotel, “they’ve
gone the limit down there; wimmen
runnin’ about with nothin’ on an’ every-
thin’! No wonder none o’ the blokes
down there ever do any work.” And
the three daughters of the clergyman
from Bullock Elbow, holidaying by the
sea, never knew how their innocent frolic
in the dawn had ruined the reputation of
all coast-dwellers as far as Dingo Cross-
ing was concerned.
* * * *
“Naturala”: While perusing a nest of
sergeant-ants—s.-w. W.A. red variety, a
full inch in length and straddled on legs
which lift the abdomen a good quarter-
inch from the ground—l found myself
stung right through the thick skin of the
top of a finger. Pain was equal to the
worst bee-sting, but lasted much longer.
No swelling, however, followed at the
time ; now, a week later, the spot is hard
and numb, with the pain returning, A
favorite theme of past novelists was to
tie a victim down on top of the home of
such red devils. I couldn’t imagine any
human surviving half a page.
“Strop”: “E. 2” (B. 24/12/’47) evoked
my sympathy for the man who was stung
by a bull-ant. The pain is out of all
proportion to the size of the puncture.
When my first dose was jabbed into my
forefinger I had no standard of com-
parison, but it reminded me of the time
when my thumb foolishly came between
an anvil and a sledge-hammer.
* * *
“Palms”: I’ve read all sorts of reasons
why coconuts never grow along the N.Q.
coast. The nuts are there, and I’ll wager
that there’s a drift nut every 100 yards'
of the coastline. The main reason against
germination is the salt-soaking of the sea
while they drift south. For 20 years on
the coast I’d never known one of these
ocean wanderers to germinate. Then,
during 1936, particularly among the
islands of the Passage, I struck nuts
sprouting in a dozen places. The fact
that it was a leap year might explain it.
* * * *
“Wippegong” : Those concerned with
seniority lists and their hallowed rules of
precedence should find much interest in
the promotion system practised by the
ticks on a wombat. New recruits start
behind the animal’s ears, where they may
learn to cling and burrow and suck in
comparative shelter; then as they gain
familiarity with the routine required of
them they edge their way aft until in
sight of the bold spirits exposed on the
shoulders. Here the battle begins, for
once out on that eminence the insects
must withstand the bumps from narrow-
ing walls at home, survive being lain on,
and weather the flying dirt when the
host decides to extend his quarters. Those
that come through gain positions along
the ribs and back, as vacancies occur,
and if they’re not scraped off by the
scrub arrive in time around the rump,
where they settle comfortably in per-
manent ease. There is little movement
among the big-shots ; they just hold down
their possies in the lee of the weather,
and grow round like peas. I suppose
they drop off when their days, are done,
allowing a mild “general post” to ripple
along the wombat’s ribs until all places
are again taken, but, as in other systems
I’ve noticed, no junior is allowed to settle
in the Realm of the Polished Seat.
* * * *
“Skipper”: Nowadays only an odd
fishing-boat ventures into the stormy
waters of Tasmania’s wild south-west
coast. Before the turn of the century
several families made their home on the
shores of Port Davey, gaining a com-
fortable living out of Huon-pine-logging
on the fringes of the waterways. Living
was primitive, and apart from reserves
of flour and bacon they lived on the
country until the pine was cut out. Game
and fish are still plentiful, providing
tucker for the lonely prospector who
occasionally tries for riches in the great
barren marshes and mountains. In Mela-
leuca Inlet, one of the port’s many
"I'll toss you for her. Bob: head or tail?”
marshy areas, the King family have
struck it, panning a ton of tin monthly.
The dwelling is on the Nissen-hut prin-
ciple, familiar to members of the A.I.F.
Made comfortable with open fireplace
and cooking-range, the furniture has
been fashioned from the natural shapes of
timbers. A fishing-boat calling every
three months with stores is the only link
with civilisation, wireless being useless
because of the geological formation of
the country.
* * * *
“Uramao”: A Yank ornithologist visit-
ing New Zealand some years ago saw
“fantails,” and declared that he would
cheerfully award them ap “Oscar” for
their “gosh-darned acrobatics.” Explain-
ing the extraordinary flights of these
small birds, a local ornithologist said
that their gyrations were a natural part
of fodder-hunting. He asserted that while
watching a “fantail” one day in a planta-
tion he noticed a shaft of light penetrate
the shade. This lit up the bodies of
microscopic insects on the wing, and the
“fantail” then showed his partiality to the
almost-invisible flies and the reason for
the “jitterbugging” which had confounded
the American. “Fantail” also pursues the
ordinary housefly and appears to kill it
not for food but from sheer hatred.
* * *
“Stinger”: “Dronestung’s s'’ 5 '’ dissection
of a bee’s probe recalls my meeting with
the business end of a stingray. As re-
venge I later pulled that sting apart and
decided that there was no poison in it;
slime and assorted filth which coat the
sting do the damage. I boiled the sting
down, and when the slime came away it
left the bone, almost exactly inches
long, hard as ivory and tapered to a point
from a flat base. The interesting thing
about it was the number of barbs
—not noticeable till the slime had
been removed. There were 110 on
each side, needing a magnifying-glass to
distinguish them. The barbs weren’t
measurable on my footrule; but, at a
rough comparison, they’d each be as long
as the point of a medium “J” nib is
across. They held the slime in place.

“Don E.”: On the Prince’s Highway,
about eight miles north of Benandarah,
a tall green stringbark was recently
struck by lightning. The path taken by
the earthing charge is plainly visible,
starting near the top of the tree and fol-
lowing the trunk down in a slow spiral.
The bark is furred out from nine inches
to a foot all the way down a track that
is about six inches wide. But the unique
feature of the whole thing is the fact that
the track ends about 18 inches from the
ground and then appears about three feet
up on the other side of a trunk about
four feet thick, thence running down to
earth. Apart from this narrow track
down the trunk and a couple of small
limbs smashed off near the top, the tree
is unmarked and yet it is doomed and
dying.

“Gem”: Jim trudged on along the
barbed-wire fence wiping the sweat from
his brow and snorting that a lost whip
was not worth being baked for, even if it
was the boss’s keepsake, and nearly 20
years old. Shimmering “heat-devils”
laughed in his eyes. He trudged on over
the parched brown paddocks and at last
came upon the corner stockyard. Through
his squint he saw the whip-end hanging
loosely from the rail and grabbed for it.
Suddenly startled, the goanna almost
slipped from the rail, caught its balance
and turned two beady eyes to stare upon
the man holding its tail with outstretched
arm. Came a mighty “ ’Struth! ” from
Jim, a hectic cawing of crows in
the gums, and then a silence broken by
the padding of Jim’s feet as he started on
the 10-mil© trip to the Royal. The old
goanna settled himself again,

“Hanko”: The boss was kneeling-in an
outside row when he snatched his hand
from a sheaf and glared angrily at
Choom, who was turning on the stack.
“Why the devil don’t y’ yell out ‘thistle’
when y’ see one in a sheaf?” he growled.
“That’s the third time I’ve got pricked
with the flamin’ things in the last ten
minutes.” “Sorry, sir,” Choom mumbled,
and in his agitation landed the next sheaf
butt-first against the trump’s neck. The
boss roared like a bull as he clung des-
perately to the stack’s edge. A calm for
a while, and then Choom began to say
something. The boss, by now quite
jittery, jerked his hand from the sheaf,
examined it closely, then scowled bale-
fully at Choom. “There ain’t no thistle
in that one,” he bawled. “Oi didn’t say
there be, sir,” said Choom. “Oi were
a-goin’ to say. This’ll be third load since
loonch,’ when you intercepted me.”

“Gravelsnatcher”: A ton of swordfish
cleaving the water at 60 m.p.h. (B.
24/12/’47) —fast enough to drive the
sword through 20in. of stout copper-
sheathed wood—creates an impression of
extreme animal energy. Yet, pound for
pound, a man possesses, and uses, nearly
twice as much strength as a fish. A man,
harnessed to a line and' played like a
fish, registered a pult of .3 of a pound
per pound of weight. In the same test,
the best a shark could produce was .17
of a pound. Fortunately for the shark,
he doesn’t need the extra power. He can
travel five times as fast as a man —in
water —for the expenditure of half the
energy. Not so the whale. As a penalty
for living in an unnatural element, he
employs something like 50 horsepower
for a speed of 11 m.p.h., with the neces-
sity for frequent refuelling. The whale
uses its tail as a propulsion unit—its tail-
flukes act as two blades of a propeller—
whereas in a true fish the tail is not the
main driving force. It derives its speed
from the undulations of the body, which
“ripple” against the water and propel it
forward, and the “induced streamline”
system with which it is equipped. This
system consists of jets of water squirted
through its gills very like the scheme
employed for the same purpose on
modern steamers —a device which, oddly,
was invented before the discovery of the
natural type.

“W.P.T.”: The Digger was looking
over a block of land and considering its
possibilities. The agent suggested wheat,
sheep, cattle or even rabbits. The
Digger was silent for a long time. “It’s
a pity it’s so far from the sea,” he finally
remarked. “Otherwise I could start a
new industry up here.” “What?” asked
the agent. “Oysters,” said the Digger.
“There are enough rocks here to grow
millions.”
* * * *
“Flip”: Harry Barr staggered into
Casey’s, slumped on a chair near the bar
and called for something strong. As the
mob edged in to hear the worst, Harry
spilt it: “I came into town this mornin’
to get me thatch trimmed and headed for
Alf’s ; he wasn’t in his shop, so I grabbed
the chair and waited. I heard footsteps
behind me and hollered, ‘Cut the lot off,
Alf! ’ Then I looked in the mirror,
A woman!—clippers and all. She
told me that Alf’s gone down to the city
for his holidays. She’s his cousin. Come
up to take over the practice for a month.
She starts talkin’. ’Strewth, Alf was
bad enough—but her! We talked
about this here new hemline, creep-de-
sheen blouses and leg-a-mutton sleeves.
When I got out of the chair I was rocking,
so I headed out back for a game of
snooker to steady the nerves, and then I
found that she’s got pot-plants in the
cuspidors and has all the pills arranged
in pairs around the table so they’ll look
prettiest. It was horrible, blokes, hor-
rible.” Obviously shaken, the mob dis-
persed, each vowing to let his hair grow
long for the next four weeks. But one
of them completes the story: “Harry
was cunnin’ all right. Later in the day
I seen him with a bunch of violets in his
hand, lookin’ over his shoulder until he
disappeared into the barber’s. So I moved
up across the street from the shop, and
there’s Harry through the window, all
smiles and lather, bein’ shaved. ’E was
married to ’er in a fortnight.”
* * * *
“Big Billy”: During training days of
the recent stoush, a pair of wagtails
chose the ridgepole of our tent for their
new home. A carefully-folded towel pro-
tected the nest from the eagle eyes of the
orderly-officer until it was in an advanced
state, and then combined representations
by the “tent” allowed it to remain. And
before our four months’ stay was over
the parents had hatched-out their healthy
brood free from the worries of prowling
felines, the lizard family or winged pre-
dators.
* * * *
“Propalong”: Binghi is often cited as
a perfect example of the awful things that
can happen to a race or an individual
whose life activities are regulated solely
by custom, tradition and the word of the
old men. It seems more reasonable to
suppose that tribal custom, restrictive as
it was, embodied the’practical experience
of the race and was, therefore, of great
survival value to a primitive people who
had no written expression. Personal ex-
periment on the part of an enterprising
boong who had decided that there was
nothing at all in the tribal tradition of
tiger-snakes being deadly would pro-
duce merely a “gone coon.” It is the
advent of the white man, breaking down
this elaborate system of tribal marriage
laws, which has done more to kill out
the native than anything else.
* * * *
“Waddlin’ Willie”: For sheer deter-
mination the droving trips of Frank
Hann, Lawn Hill station, Burketown, be-
tween 1870 and 1900 take some beating.
Included were his extensive explorations
among the rugged King Leopold Ranges
between Derby and Wyndham. Toward
the end of the last century Hann took up
Grace’s Knob, a rugged run on the outer-
most limit of settlement, 200 miles north
of Derby. Largest tributary of the Fitz-
roy, the Hann River, is named after him.
He also blazed the track from the gold-
fields to Oodnadatta and crossed and re-
crossed that illimitable plain of mirage
and thirst where today speed the luxuri-
ous “Trans” train and the four-engined
Douglas Skymaster. During the war
years I saw many of his marked trees on
the Charnley River and, with a R.A.A.F.
cobber, cut away the encroaching bark,
slowly effacing his markings—“F.H.,
1898.”
A LAY OF LOST HORSES.
Where are the horses we loved of old,
The brown, the bay and the grey,
With their limbs of steel and their hearts of gold
To tackle the longest day ?
Crowded out of the ways they went
And the old rough roads they trod,
Are they feeding now in a long content
On the frontage plains of God?
No need for them now in the old bushland
With a new love calling to her —
A steering-wheel for the bridle-hand
And a pedal in place of spur.
We can remember them, you and I,
As they bunched in the station yard
With the Warrego mud on their flanks half dry
And the foam on their shoulders starred.
We can remember them ranged in line
On the hitching-posts in town,
Waiting so patiently, yours and mine,
The bay, the grey and the brown.
We can remember the galloping days
When we mustered the colts of old,
And flashed through the mulga-scrub like a
blaze
To wheel them and head them and hold.
We can remember —but why regret,
And why for the past repine?
There are dreams in the night when we ride
them yet,
Those favorites—yours and mine!
SCOTLAND.

“C.E.”: Bob Hanlon dropped off his
horse where Paddy was mending the
fence. “Charlie been along for his
milkers yet?” he inquired. “Not yet.”
Paddy squinted up at the sun. “Should
be along any time now,” he added. “It’s
going on for five, and I’ve never known
him ... yair, here he comes,” he added as
a figure appeared over the rise. “Or ...”
He straightened up and shaded his eyes.
“Or is it?” Bob, too, turned to stare
wonderingly. “Yes, it’s Charlie all right,”
he nodded. “But what’s the matter with
him? Must be crook or something.”
“Don’t think so,” puzzled the other. “He
was right enough last night. Looks dif-
ferent, though. Seems to be his feet. Per-
haps he’s got new boots. Doesn’t appear
to be limping, though. Cripes, I dunno.”
They watched as the old bloke came up,
nodded and reached for the makings,
“What’s the matter with y’, Chari?”
Paddy asked, still taking him in. “We
hardly knew y’ coming along.” Charlie
looked sheepish. “Knew y’ couldn’t help
but spot it,” he mumbled. “But y’ see
he lamed himself this morning chasing a
rabbit, so I just had to come for me cows
today without old Darkie!”

“Blinker”: Introduced into Queensland
to combat the sugar-cane beetle and now
a problem itself, the hardy toad can eat
more than lighted cigarette-butts without
a shudder. At least one in our Queens-
land training camp, however, came to
grief via its voracious appetite and habit
of flicking into its mouth with its tongue
any morsel, tasty or otherwise, thrown in
its direction. Our Sergeant Ammunition
Examiner, struggling with his weekly
letter home, idly broke off pieces of cor-
dite and tossed them to the ground, where
they were eagerly consumed by the toad.
A lighted cigarette-butt followed, and
was flicked into the accumulation of
H.E. The toad expired with a dull ex-
plosion.

“Flathead”: Whether he was after
jewies, bream or whiting, Alf used the
same 300 yd. line of tough cord. He had
just tossed it out, tying the other end to
the ring in the bow, when a sudden jar
followed by a slow movement of the boat
behind the straining cord suggested a
whopper: Alf grabbed for the oars and
took in some slack. Still circling the bay
half an hour later, the fish headed for
the foreshore, and Alf set up a bow-wave
getting in to have a look at it in the
shallows. When he spied seven feet of
“You advertised for a comic-strip model, I believe?”
Grey Nurse under his dinghy Alf took in
as much line as possible, tied it again, and
then sat back waiting for his wire trace
to be bitten through. Deciding on further
walkabout, however, the big fish cruised,
and Alf suddenly spotted one of those
prize goats who upset life-assurance cal-
culations by swimming in the open
water and bellowed “Get out, mate!”
The bloke’s head, only partly show-
ing, replied with a raspberry. Alf
warned him again: “All right, mug, I’m
not rowing and I ain’t got a motor in this
craft, see—yet I’m movin’. Have a look

“Plop”: I had heard that Mrs. Bar-
nett was an admirable, proud cook, and.
determined to be courteous on my visit,
I ate everything placed before me; by late
Sunday afternoon of the gluttonous week-
end it seemed only a matter of time be-
fore I exploded. Usually sure-fire safety-
valves, the side-fasteners of my trousers
had ceased to operate on the previous
day, and I lay back in the chair sensing a
feeling of great inward strain and being
so full that I could not close my eyes.
However, I managed to smile when I re-
called how my martyrdom had seemed
to please Mrs. Barnett, and how happily
she had ladled out my third helping of
steamed pudding at lunch-time. The lady
herself interrupted my thoughts when she
came in to announce “Dinner’s ready,
Will you call Harry and young Alfred?”
I managed to get on to my feet and call
to her husband and son to come up from
the vegetable-patch, trying to sound eager
to begin the meal. The first inkling I
had that I’d made a bad slip somewhere
came in the course of that dinner —pork,
with a horrible profusion of apple-sauce
and green-peas. Young Alfred piped
up: “Daddy, why did you say Mr. Plop
was mullet-gutted—what does it mean?”
General confusion, thin smiles and some
involved explanation. Alfred was quiet
for a while, but he had another query:
“And what did you mean when you said
Mr. Plop would make Mat Gabbett look
like a piker?” That was enough. I stood
up without a word, rolled over to the
hallstand, grabbed my hat and left.

“Dong”: Snoozer Williams claims he
could coil up on the Inchcape Bell and
awake refreshed in the morning—l quite
believe it, for I’ve seen him actually sleep
comfortably in a dog-box Old Master of
“Who put soapy Water in the radiator ?”
N.S.W.G.R. He gives as his recipe for
sound slumber: “Never get eixcited about
nothin’.” Only recorded incidence of his
really being awake was the time he took
a hand in a shearing-shed poker-game.
The historian declares that Snoozer
snapped up his hand from the table and
remarked that he felt lucky; 20 seconds
later, when the dealer asked “How many
d’ya want?” Snoozer is said to have re-
plied with a low whistling snore, uncon-
cerned by the trifling fact that he
was full on aces.
* * * *
“Camsa”: Young Dan Cooper, who
last October broke a world machine-
record by shearing 325 Corriedale weaners
in eight hours at Glenara Station, Lang-
koop, Victoria, is back in Adelaide after
shearing on the Kimberley and east gold-
fields runs and in the W.A. wheatbelt.
His father broke the machine-record in
1909, when he shore 316 in* eight hours
at Bundooran, Queensland. Young Dan
started shearing five years ago and did
some of his learning with Bob Sawallish,
a member of the “Mad Eight,” who shore
9176 the first week and 8770 the second
week at Williambury in W.A.
♦ * * *
“Plankton”: “Chestnut” is the correct
term for the horny knob on the foreleg
of the horse (B. 7/l/’4B), and according
to the experts “This rounded tubercle
actually represents the coracoid bone.”
It is reduced to a projecting extension on
the inside of the shoulder-blade in man,
also in the rabbit; in the young of the
latter, however, the bone is separate.
Examine the skeleton of a domestic
chook, and there it will be .found the
coracoid is a straight strong bone ex-
tending from the shoulder to the fore end
of the breastbone. The term “chest-
nut” obviously comes from its similarity
of form to the seed of the horse-chestnut-
tree.
* * * *
“Shorty”; The village Smithy was not
only a place of romance for youngsters
(B. 5/11/ ’47). It was a cosy hide-out for
wife- and work-dodgers. * The assorted
hardware, anvil, swedge and sledge-
hammer, invited feats of strength with
yarns to suit. It was the place where
the wags of the village brought out their
latest sidesplitters, though usually the
boss was able to cap them, for his was
a tough breed. Our Bob Smith had a
favorite dodge when there were young-
sters about. Huddled up in a dark corner,
the kids would be already shivering at
the strangeness of it all when Bob would
give the anvil a quick “dust” with his
apron and plant a good spit in the middle.
Then out would come the glowing piece
of iron fair on top of the spit and down
would come the hammer. The resulting
crack would send those urchins crawling
up the wall. ->
♦ * * *
“Bogaduck”: I’ve met men who have
seen the death-adder actually try to sting
with the spine of its tail and others who
swear that it will strike when any por-
tion of its body is touched. The South
Australian Museum has now conducted
a series of investigations which should
settle all arguments. Their experiments
show that the death-adder can be rolled
around with a stick, poked, prodded and
generally mishandled without evoking any
response unless the sensitive tail-tip is
touched. When that happens the adder
whips around in a curve —it does not bend
over backwards- —and strikes in a flash.
Dissection shows that a network of nerves
is connected with the tail-tip and that
when the tip is touched it causes a reflex
action.
“M.”: The fence borderedi the main
road, and the contractors had been on
the job barely half an hour when Harry
Matthews rode along and swung side-
ways for a yarn. Two hours later, as he
disappeared in the dust, Bob Hanley
pulled up. He was followed in succes-
sion by Bill and Rod Wilson, Mack
Scanlon and Coxie, After two more
days like the first, Charlie specu-
latively took in the small amount of
work done. “Can’t ask Woolbales t’ make
it day wa-ges,” he murmured. “We
got t’ work it diff’rent though, if we’re
goin’ t’ make tucker.” Next morning
Harry Matthews found Charlie working
alone. * “The very bloke I’m lookin’ for,”
Charlie greeted him. “Give us a hand
in with this strainer, will y’? Bit awk-
ward on me own.” Harry gave a hand.
“That’s it. Now just hold her while I
do the rammin’,” Charlie went on.
“There’s a lot o’ these posts a bit heavy.”
He was glancing suggestively along the
line when the visitor left. Further along,
Harry'met Ted. “Can’t give us a hand
t’ run this wire, can y’?” Ted asked hope-
fully. “Want t’ finish this span t’day.”
A couple of days later the pair got no-
thing but handwaves as the busy locals
hurried on their way.
* * * *
“Chick”: “Betcha’s” outsize thirst (B.
31/12/ ’47) can be cured easily by break-
ing the drought with a half-teaspoon of
common salt in a large glass of water and,
if necessary, following up a bit later with
another of the same. This will not pre-
vent “Betcha” from having several cups
of tea if he wants them —as a matter of
fact, with a freshened palatei he should
find the tea even more enjoyable.
Abnormal thirst is Nature’s way of ask-
ing for something to be done about the
internal shortage of saline.
* * * *
“D.R.H.”: Many seem to have the
idea that lizards and shakes enjoy degrees
of heat that would scorch the hide off
asbestos. I walked all the afternoon
over the* tableland and along a
variety of watercourses. There were
plenty of lizard-tracks in the red earth of
the creek-flats, but I sighted none of the
blokes that made them. It’s many weeks
since I’ve seen snakes out during the day,
but a half-hour’s walk the other evening
brought me across three fresh tracks, at
the end of one of which was a hefty
“brown” that had just left the thick cover
of the swamp to hunt mice in the sandy
hummocks. As the reptilian body tem-
perature rises and falls with that of its
environment, any Joe Blake exposed to
the sun on a scorching day would soon
turn it in.
* * * *
“Anthropo”: The notion that Binghi
had soles tougher than buffalo leather
(B. 24/12/’47) is widespread but wrong.
Actually the abo.’s soles were quite nor-
mal ; he didn’t walk metalled roads but
the soft leaf and sand of the bush. He
had an ancient trick of advancing on an
enemy with open hands but with long
spears held between each big-toe and
the next, dragged unseen through the
grass. Could that have been done by a
foot with a half-inch sole?
* * * *
“Yow”: North Queensland bushmen
give the snake belt for deadliness and
viciousness to the taipan, better known
as the “McLellan Brown.” This fellow
attains a length of eight feet, and has a
charming disposition that makes it go
out of its way to greet anything that
moves about its territory. An Ingham
(North Queensland) canefarmer died,
despite medical aid, within 15 minutes of
being bitten on the leg. There is no anti-
dote for poison of the taipan, and he
snaps like a terrier, injecting up to a tea-
spoon of venom at one strike. Instead
of following the usual snake practice of
slithering out of sight at the approach of
a moving vehicle it stays put, rears its
head and strikes at the nearest part
LONG NIGHT.
I cannot sleep. Deep in my tired mind
The tide is swelling, and the old moon calls.
The surging darkness presses. Light is gone,
And grief burns phosphorescent on the walls
That crush and hold me in. And I can find
Only the rusted past. The hours beat on.
The shadows drift out with the moon and float
At last into the west. Now morning wakes
And walks upon the hills. The great stars fade.
I diear the surf of grey belahs that breaks
Like waves of those forgotten seas that wrote
Their histories here in the rocks they made.
Beyond the moaning trees,
Where cold wind-currents run,
In the moon’s ebbing light
A curlew cries, as one
Out on the timeless seas,
Out on the tideless night.

WHAT does a Jig look like? What does it do?
A Jig, in the parlance of the engineer, has nothing
to do with the Emerald Isle, the Blarney Stone or
the 17th of March,
Engineers build Jigs for specific tasks. A Jig is a
guide to continued perfection in the machining of
certain parts. It is as essential to accuracy in manu-
facturing as a limit gauge, and is a vital factor in
modern production methods.
The precision which Jigs make possible cannot
be over-estimated. They are used in many dif-
ferent stages of the manufacture of Ronaldson-
Tippett Engines, doing their part in assuring that
standard of precision which has made these en-
gines famous throughout Australia.

Higher Drenching Costs.
“Dungaree”: Various factors
have affected supply and costs.
Carbon tetrachloride and tetra-
chlorethylene are made here, and
their prices are practically un-
changed. Both very economical
to use, they have the advantage
of a small dose-rate when used
against liver - fluke and large
stomach worms; they are in-
effective against intestinal and
bowel worms. In a wet sum-
mer like this they should be
widely used to keep down an
infestation that is bound to be
serious this season.
Bluestone-nicotine, the one-
time mainstay of the sheepman,
has practically vanished. Still,
the special leaf from which it is
manufactured is now being
grown in Australia, and nicotine
for drenching purposes is pro-
duced here. This makes us in-
dependent of imports, but the
cost of the locally-made article
is high. However, it is still
cheaper on first cost than pheno-
thiazine, and may be used for
general drenching in a year
when worm infestation is bound
to be severe and when drench-
ing will have to be done much
more frequently than usual.
Nicotine is no good against
nodule and bowel worms, nor
against black-scour worm. A
large percentage of sheep in
every flock don’t respond to it,
while on those where it does
reach the intestines in sufficient
strength to attack the worms it
cannot be regarded as highly
effective.
The price of phenothiazine
has risen slightly, though still
cheaper in Australia than in any
other part of the world except
America, where it is produced
in very large quantities and
where its widespread use en-
ables the cost to be kept to a
minimum. C.S.I.R. experiments
have shown that in spite of its
high first cost it is undoubtedly
the best drench of all. It has no
effect on liver-fluke or tape-
worms, but the damage dope by
the latter is negligible provided
the sheep has no other worms.
Phenothiazine is the only
drench that will kill nodule and
bowel worms, and it is much
more effective against black-
scour worms, which are the
greatest enemy of young sheep.
Phenothiazine is supplied chiefly in
powder form, which is mixed with
water to form a drench of soupy
consistency. Latterly it has been put
up in liquid form ready for use, but
this is much more expensive, and ,
there is also the danger that the
active ingredient may settle in the
bottom of the tin, like cement, with
the result that it takes nearly as long
to mix as the powder.
One disadvantage of both forms is
that apy drench spilled on the wool
or wiped on the fleece leaves a stain
which will not scour out. To over-
come this phenothiazine will shortly
be available as tablets for the sheep
to swallow. The oblong tablets, if
properly administered, cannot be
brought up by the sheep. When ad-
“ I'm sorry if it wont fit; it's the largest bucket I can find.”
ministering, the balling-gun must be
placed so that the tablet is given just
over the base of the tongue. Several
tablets will be required per head, the
number depending on the age per
sheep, and for speed iq administering
an automatic gun is necessary.
The cost of drenching with carb.
tet. is approximately Id. per head;
two years ago bluestone-nicotine cost
approximately .3d. to drench a grown
sheep; it now costs about Latest
C'.S.I.R. recommendations give two
dose-rates for phenothiazine, as it
has been found that black-scour
worm is harder to kill than large
stomach, nodule, and bowel worms.
The lower dose rate for the last-named
works out at about 2|d. per head
for lambs, up to 4d. per head for
grown sheep, while the black-scour
worm dose-rate ranges from 3d. for
lambs to 4|d. for grown sheep. Cost
of the new tablets will be about 2£d.
per head for lambs, rising to 6d.
per head for the maximum dose at
the higher rate for grown sheep.
However, it should be remembered
that this will be used chiefly for
lambs and the cost is practically on
a par with that of powder, and on
the whole cheaper than liquid pheno-
thiazine.
Handling a Colt.
“Wirrameju”: Having taught
your colt to be caught easily,
the next thing is to tie him up
and handle him. The best thing
on his head is an extremely
stout headstall. Make certain
the throat-leash is tight so that
he cannot slip it off. Pass the
neckrope (a 10ft. manilla about
lin. thick) round his neck and
tie in a bowline —the com-
monly-called “sailor’s knot,”
which will hold well and will
always undo easily. Pass the
loose end through the lower
part of the noseband and then
round a post—never a rail.
He’ll probably play up for a
while and hang back. Ignore
this; he’ll get used to it. Get
your flagging-stick and go over
him with it, avoiding the flanks,
head and neck and lower part
of the legs. As soon as he is
quite quiet put away your stick
and go over him with your
hands, but firmly. If he is quiet
enough pick up his front feet.
Do this then every time he is
caught and gradually make him
pick them hp himself. This will
save your farrier a lot of
trouble and yourself if he casts
a shoe. Don’t try the hind feet
until he is reasonably quiet or
you’ll rear a kicker.
Then, too, you can start
grooming him with a soft brush
until he objects. The hard brush
can be used in a week or two.
The curry-comb is for cleaning
the brush and for clearing the
hair. It should never be used
where the bone is close to the
skin and never on a colt.
Catch him and tie him up
often. Whenever you have a
spare moment catch and tie him
up for 10 or 15 minutes, A
good idea is to do it when feed-
ing him, so that he begins to
associate the two and will be
caught willingly. Just catching
him, picking up his feet and
letting him go again will do a
great deal for him at this stage,
and can easily be done four or
five times a day,
A great deal depends on his
being handled quietly and con-
fidently. For at this stage you
can make or break his confi-
dence. He is getting used to
having you round, and is learn-
ing that you are not going to
hurt him unless he plays up.
Remember he is mentally a
child and his mentality, like a
child’s, will develop if you help
him with good care and hand-
ling,
Milk-Fever.
“K.W.R.”: It may occur in
ewes before, during, or after
lambing, and is caused by a sud-
den drop in the amount of
minerals circulating in the blood-
stream ; the condition becomes
more prevalent as the age of the
ewe flock increases.
An attack may come from
fasting during shearing, crutch-
ing, or jetting, or as the result
of a railway journey or eating
poisonous plants. Many plants
regarded as good sheep feed con-
tain at various stages of growth
large quantities of oxalic acid
which, when eaten, lowers the
blood minerals and sets up milk-
fever. Salt-bush and pigweed
are rich in oxalic acid.
A diet low in minerals—green
oats are notoriously bad in this
respect —may predispose animals
to attacks. Exercise also may
cause a sudden mineral defi-
ciency in the blood, while para-
sitic infestation, such as a high
infestation of hair-worms, will
decrease the blood’s minerals
and precipitate symptoms of
milk-fever.
First symptoms noticeable are
excitement and unsteadiness on
the feet. Backs become arched
and heads are thrust forward in
an attempt to prevent falling.
If sheep do go down they have
extreme difficulty in rising, and
if lifted up they assume a
cramped attitude and refuse to
take weight on their.feet. Severe
muscular trembling also is pre-
sent. If a sheep remains down
it becomes drowsy and finally
unconscious; food is regurgi-
tated from the paunch, the nos-
trils become blocked, and the
animal snores when it breathes.
Untreated sheep usually die
within 24 hours, particularly if
the weather is cold.
The most obvious and success-
ful treatment, restoration of
minerals to the bloodstream, is
effected by injecting under the
skin from 30 to 50 c.c. of a 20
p.c. (4oz. to a pint) solution of
calcium borogluconate. A hypo-
dermic syringe is required. If
no response is obtained within
20 minutes, this injection should
be followed with one of about
5 c.c. of a 5 p.c. solution (loz. to
a pint) of Epsom salts. Where
there is no response to calcium
or Epsom salts solutions, it is
reasonable to assume that the
animal is affected by one of
several other conditions of whicn
the symptoms simulate hypo-
calcaemia (milk-fever). Except
in big grazing areas, the disease
is easy to treat provided the
necessary equipment is always on
hand, and prompt action taken
when an outbreak occurs.
Fertilisers and Food.
“Agric”: The Agricultural
committee of U.N.F.A.Q. has
recommended the organisation
to take steps “towards the elimi-
nation of the fallacy that the
rational use of fertilisers may be
harmful to humans, livestock
and soil.” There has been con-
siderable diversity of opinion
about this, and if expert advice
is worth anything, we should be
hearing less from the anti-arti-
ficial fertiliser enthusiasts in
future. Another interesting
statement is that from 3 p.c. to
12 p.c. of foods produced are
destroyed by insects, mites, bac-
teria, and mould fungi; this loss
is claimed to be equal to one-
half of the foodstuffs entering
world trade.
The Australian delegation to
U.N.F.A.O. reported that, in the
United Kingdom, the additional
amount of food required to bring
the diet of the population up to
the desirable health standard re-
presents an increase of 25 p.c. :
for meat and from 60 to 70 p.c.
for other animal products, fruit
and vegetables, while even in
the U.S.A. one-third of the
population had insufficient suit-
able food to maintain a desirable
health standard; butter produc-
tion would need to be increased
by 15 p.c. and fruit and vege-
tables by 75 p.c. to provide an
adequate diet for every citizen
of that country.
Citrus Bugs.
“W. Court”: They are among
the worst pests of the Queens-
land fruit industry, but they can
be exterminated by a spray
solution of resin, caustic soda
and fish-oil. To make a con-
centrate, grind 101 b. of resin,
then dissolve 31b. caustic soda
of good quality in 2gal. of water
over a steady fire. With the mix-
ture boiling slowly, gradually
add the powdered resin, stirring
constantly to dissolve the latter
properly, and to prevent it from
adhering to the sides of the
boiler. The mixture will expand
during the boiling, so a deep
vessel should be used to elimi-
nate risk of boiling over. When
the solution appears fairly clear
but dark beneath the surface
scum, stir in lylb. fish-oil and
boil for about lOmin. more. It
should be diluted with 38gal. of
cold water for use at once, or
stored in an air-tight vessel.

Cattle-Sheep Ratio.
“Mr.”: My 10 sheep to one
head of cattle, mentioned as a
desirable ratio to maintain a
grass-clover balance in a pasture
(B. 3/12/’47), applies to Vic-
toria and similar temperate coun-
try with a 20-40 in. rainfall, and
not to dfy inland areas as
“Woolly” suggests (B.
24/12/’47). It applies also to
land on which there is clovef,
for obviously land without
clover would not require this
grazing treatment. If it’s risky
to put cattle with sheep in a pad-
dock with a dam in it, because
of the danger of the sheep bog-
ging, why not replace the dam
with troughing? The good
farmer no longer scoops out a
dam as a watering-place. When-
ever one of these fluke- and
mosquito-infested mud-wallows
disfigures his property, he fills it
in or fences it out until he can
get time to put in troughs.
Phalaris Management.
“Prof.”: Established Phalaris
is an excellent grass, very palat-
able, mixes well with other pas-
ture plants, withstands severe
droughts and, the opposite ex-
treme, severe flooding. Although
it grows on a wide range of soil
types it does best in fairly deep
sand overlying a firm subsoil.
In this it competes with veldt
grass as a pasture, though veldt
is quicker to establish and easier
to manage. On the other hand,
Phalaris will grow under much
wider conditions than veldt. For
the first two years Phalaris
stands must be allowed to de-
velop without check, and on no
account must a cover crop be
sown with the seed, as Phalaris,
when young, will not stand com-
petition. Established stands
must be mowed whenever neces-
sary to keep down stemmy
growth. Lucerne, 51b,, and
Phalaris, lib., makes a first-
class pasture greatly appreciated
by dairy cows.
Meadow Hay.
“E. 2”: It’s come to the fore
as reserve stockfeed on dairy-
farms in Victoria so much that
silage and oaten hay are out of
fashion. The best comes from
topdressed, well-balanced pas-
tures of clovers, ryegrass and
cocksfoot, which follows on for
subsequent rotational grazing.
The hay has much better feed
value than silage, though sub-
ject to the likelihood of rain
damage while curing. Latest
methods beat everything but the
weather.
The grass is mown and left
lying to cure, then raked into
rows. A new type of hay rake
picks up the hay and feeds it by
continuous side-delivery to the
rows, the machine having rotary
rakes. Next a pick-up press—
one kind handles over 200 bales
an hour with two men —gathers
the harvest in short time.
Some presses are worked by
contractors, others are owned
and used on a co-operative basis.
The latter, where a fair system
and understanding is worked out,
have proved highly satisfactory
and least expensive. Contract
price for pressing is a bit steep
at present, and it’s said that a
group of farmers would make
up the cost of a machine by
saved contractor’s fees in a
season.
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrrhee”: To make white
hide, place the dehaired and de-
fleshed calf-hide in a solution of
alum 41b., salt 41b., and water
4gal., and leave for six days,
moving the hide round in the
liquid a couple of times a day.
Then stretch out in the shed to
dry. When half-dry rub tallow,
fat (unsalted) 'or neatsfoot oil
well into both sides and keep this
up until the hide is nice and
supple.
“Gip”: Plough-harness should
be cleaned and oiled at least
once a week. Rub it over with a
cloth dipped in metho., paying
particular attention to the inside
of the collar and the top of the
backhand, cleaning off all lumps
formed by a mixture of dirt,
grease and hair, which if left
would soon cause a sore. Allow
it to dry, then rub well with
neatsfoot oil.
“Plane Creek”: If corn or
cane takes up the richest soil,
vegetables like French beans,
cabbage and tomatoes can be
raised between the rows. If
planted out when young plant
cane is showing through, the
vegetables will be ready to pick
long before the cane covers
them. It is not wise to crop
sizable areas in this manner,
sitjce the inter-row veges. pre-
vent the normal use of the
scarifier between the cane-drills
and may have an adverse effect
on the crop.
“Malo”: To remove warts
from a cow’s teats apply vase-
line after drying carefully. Cas-
tor-oil is' effective if regularly
applied. For persistent warts
give more lucerne and green-
stuff, and have the chemist mix
salicylic acid and collodion in
the proportion of one to sfeven.
“Gres”: If a sub-artesian bore
has stopped pumping because of
a hole in the casing, it can be
temporarily remedied in a few
minutes. Turn the pump off
until the water has sunk to the
level of the hole, then drop
down a ball of wool rolled with
mud or wet sand. Leave a few
minutes for all earth to dissolve
and start pumping again.' Three
to four pieces are enough—they
effect a complete blockage. We
have sometimes had difficulty in
finding the hole when the cas-
ing is drawn, it being plugged
so effectively.
“R. I. Red”: Keep the water-
supply up to the chooks in hoi
weather. Fowls will perish
rather than cross hot ground for
water ; nor will they drink stale
water. See that they do not
“crowd” together during heat-
waves. We look at ours about
every half-hour and rarely lose
any. Our neighbor, “a night and
morning visitor” to his, lost 30
out of 70 White Leghorns one
day last year through the crowd-
ing.
“Sarina”: The waxed card-
board covers of dry-cell batteries
make great fire-lighting material.
Torn into pieces, they burn with
strong heat and make the use
of small wood unnecessary in
firing logs. One of the carbon
rods carefully sharpened at one
end may be used as a marking-
pencil by Carpenters. Thrown
into the kitchen stove, the zinc
cells prevent soot from accumu-
lating in the chimney. Further-
more, if a very small fire is
kindled and an old dry-cell
battery laid upon it, the
chemicals will burn with pretty
colors, which will be very notice-
able at night.
“Bill C.”: Before handling
arsenical tree-killers smear your
hands liberally with vaseline or
some similar grease. The toxic
material won’t penetrate through
the fatty coating to get into skin
abrasions on your hands and
cause blood-poisoning.

Temporary Embarrassment.
“A New York woman won a
divorce on the grounds that her
husband made her walk behind him
in the street because her shortness
embarrassed him.”
When my uncle Alcibiades
found that his wife was em-
barrassing him in public, not-
ably by wearing a hat compris-
ing an emu’s nest complete with
a clutch of eggs, he took more
assertive steps.
His first attempt at retalia-
tion was to go out with her in
his work - clothes. His job at
the time was a model for a
statue of Phoebus Apollo, so his
costume was, to put it i ndldly,
classical. My aunt, hetfeyer,
circumvented him by carrying
with her a voluminous Mexican
poncho, which she threw over
his head. The hole in the centre
was just too small to admit his
head, and the duration of his
struggles enabled my aunt to
lead him home, while she dissi-
pated curious sightseers by ex-
plaining that he was an escap-
ologist travelling incognito.
My uncle next attacked her
through her sense of pride.
Selecting a busy corner, he
would stop, remove his hat,
assume a downtrodden air and
break wistfully into the strains
of ‘Til Walk Beside You” vor
“Danny Boy,” My aunt defeated
this by a simple act of co-opera-
tion. She caused the crowd to
disperse with startling rapidity
by passing round uncle’s hat.
Uncle’s' last throw hit the
jackpot. When he pretended to
suffer from recurring attacks of
invisibility, refused to admit
that people could see him and
waited expectantly to be walked
through, she gave him best and
returned her hat to the bereaved
emu. She took it back again,
however, when uncle stoutly re-
fused to be visible to two medi-
cal friends of his, and was re-
moved to another place.
Having since been very visible
to uncle’s creditors, we are be-
ginning to have doubts about his
insanity.

BRIAN BUREAU.
“Stunt” Press Editors’ Quiz.
1. Consequent upon your
board’s intimation that the
paper’s political alignment for
the week is to be “slightly right
of centre,” you launch a fierce
editorial attack on what you call
the wild socialistic schemes of
the twin political dangers Ward
and Calwell. Two days later
in a letter to the editor a reader
points out that the week before
your editorials were heaping
lavish praise on Messrs. Calwell
and Ward for their “statesman-
like qualities” and for their
“great moral courage in putting
into effect what after all is the
first plank of their party’s plat-
form,” and that you had com-
pared the two favorably with
the younger Pitt. He wants to
know can’t your rag make up
its mind what party to back, and
dares you to publish the letter.
What reason other than lack of
space would compel you to
“kill” the letter?
2. Newsprint restrictions have
compelled you to eliminate one
of two features. The first is an
old - established column, well
written by a man who
thoroughly knows his subject,
on international affairs of the
day; the other is a column of
advice for ’teen-agers on boy
problems by Margot Morkish
(old Joe, in room 72, who shaves
every third day and spends most
of his time humming beer and
pipe tobacco). Quite apart
from the paper’s oft-expressed
opinion that the ’teen-ager is a
Most Important Person, give at
least five other reasons why the
column on international affairs
is the one due for ditching,
3. It being April 1, you con-
sider it appropriate to launch a
spirited attack on the too-preva-
lent craze for gambling, with
particular reference to s.-p.
betting. Just as the type is about
to be dropped into the page you
realise that it will appear oppo-
site the inserted s.-p. supple-
ment. Would you consider it
prudent to mark this sub-leader
“Hold” and dash off something
pn the need for our country to
place its faith in peace, not in
a strong defence, but in U.N.0.?
4. On the day the Beach
Lovelies Contest sponsored by
your paper opens a famous
British medical scientist whose
discoveries have resulted in the
saving of thousands of lives
arrives here by air. Glancing
over the make-up you are horri-
fied to find that the scientist’s
photo has been splashed on the
front page, while the first contest
entrant, a Bondi Beach Lovely
who has been snapped at an
angle which appealingly dis-
plays her no-strap one-piecer,
has been relegated to page 10.
After arranging necessary trans-
positions explain why you would
tick off your subordinate for
this gross carelessness.
5. You have conducted a Gal-

Air Transport
“Tackline S.’s” suggestion that Govern-
ments are trying to tax air travel into
the luxury class (B. 3/12/’47) is almost
funny. It is a luxury—a very expensive
one —and one thing exercising the minds
of Governments today is how they can
get out of paying the major part of the
cost without eliminating the business
altogether. Few thinking people still
believe that future developments will en-
able air transport to bear the whole cost
itself, and there’s a growing realisation
that even Governments can devote only
so much of their resources to one object.
It is that fact, the astronomical overall
cost of modern air transport, which is
holding up the British “Brabazon” —that
and the £6O-per-passenger loss incurred by
8.0.A.C.
“T.S.” obviously believes that his air-
line ticket covers the whole cost of the
service. No doubt he also believes in
the virtues of “free” education, “free”
medicine and “free” social services.
I can usually take an abstract view of
transport matters, but now I have a real
and personal interest. Our local Govern-
ment has just introduced income tax, the
reasons given including the usual medical
services, education and social welfare, all
of them to be “free.” Civil aviation, too,
is due for a large handout, but it is
Changi airport which is to have millions
all to itself to make it fit for Constella-
tions. The powers-that-be have been
honest enough to tell us that we’ll never
get our money back,
“T.S.” may find air travel sufficiently
cheap for union secretaries and the like,
but I’m hanged if I enjoy paying through
the nose so that droves of politicians, the
Roaches and Thorntons may fly through
here in more luxury than I can afford for
myself.— Tidapa (Singapore).
“Titoslavia”
The press has been hard put to ex-
plain why a lot of Yugoslavs are leaving
Australia to return to their native hearth.
The conclusion seems to have been that
Tito had ordered them back and they
were too weak to stand on their right to
remain here until such time as an Aus-
tralian Government deports them —a
most unlikely eventuality.
Without wishing to praise unduly any
one of the many forms of Communism
in the world today, I’d like to give some
reasons why I should return to Yugo-
slavia were I a national of that country.
I have been there a few times during the
last two years and can speak from ex-
perience.
First, everyone in Yugoslavia is work-
ing, and working hard. There is no 40-
hour week —there is a task for each
worker, and it is always done. Houses
and roads are being built everywhere,
and good houses at that. They may be
small and ill-equipped by some Aus-
tralian standards, but in the short time
that I have been in Australia since my
return from U.S.A. and Europe I have
seen many houses here that would be
pulled down if they were in Monastir,
Skoplje, Split or Electric light
is being carried into the remotest villages
now, and railways are being modernised.
Of course, all this is being carried to an
extreme —and only that which is to be is
any good ; all that was is bad.
Elderly people are the most unfortu-
nate, because they will never see the re-
sults of the changes for which they are
suffering. Respect for parents arid elderly
people is much less evident than it used
to be.
And, of course, there are psychological
reasons for these Yugoslavs’ return. After
all, it is their homeland they are going to,
and how anyone who had the leisure to
enjoy the Dalmatian coast would ever
want to leave it is more than I can
imagine.
If any of those who are returning have
been civil servants in Australia they had
better mend their ways if they want to
enter the civil service in “Titoslavia.”
A civil servant there must be civil and
he must be a servant of the people or he
will find himself transferred very quickly
to a railway- or irrigation-construction
camp. I have had it on my conscience
for some time that I complained to a
member of the Government in Yugo-
slav Macedonia about the attitude of a
junior official. I heard later that he was
transferred to a labor camp the follow-
ing day.
Yugoslavia is a country that is work-
ing for its future, and it will have a
bright future if it is not made the cockpit
of international big-Power squabbles. At
present the country needs trade and eco-
nomic assistance, and for that reason it
has turned to Russia. But anyone who
believes that Tito would leave his country
dependent on any country one
minute longer than necessary for the well-
being of Yugoslavia had better think
again. I might add that I’ve met and
talked with Tito. — Ex-nx-twofigures

Petrol Wastage
Mr. Chifley’s trip to Perth by T.-A.A.
to avoid using petrol in his own aircraft
was a belated gesture. His trip to Maori-
land in a Liberator using 60 gallons an
hour probably accounted for something
like 1500 gallons of high-octane petrol.
He could have gone by Tasman Empire
flying-boats without the use of an addi-
tional gallon of juice.
Mr. Ward’s sending a Government car
to Brisbane to bring his wife home, while
he flew down, and Drakeford’s prodigal
use of his perspnal aircraft are not likely
to inspire the general public to conserve
its petrol. Our Federal politicians could
take a lesson from the British Govern-
ment, which has instructed Ministers to
use public transport wherever possible.
One has only to live in Canberra for
a very short time to realise the colossal
waste of netrol by Ministers and their
“Got a match ?”
families. Children are driven to and from
school, wives are driven to do their
shopping, although there is an excellent
bus service. I was waiting my turn in a
hairdresser’s one day when the wife of a
Cabinet Minister rang up to cancel her
appointment because her husband needed
the car. She was then at a hotel only
seven minutes away by normal bus
service! — Wilydah (N.S.W.).
Measles
In campaigns against diseases, gastro-
enteritis and polio-myelitis rightly occupy
the forefront, but there has been insuffi-
cient research into prevention of the less
spectacular but deadly scourge rubella,
alias German measles. This disorder
usually evokes the same kind of semi-
derisive sympathy accorded the wearer
of a black eye, since the effects on the
sufferer appear both slight and tem-
porary.
Investigation has shown, however, that
rubella is a subtle and dreadful enemy
of unborn children. It strikes through
the mother during gestation and does
irreparable damage. Evidence collected
and tabulated by E. S. Holle, head
teacher of the Blind, Deaf and Dumb
School, Brisbane, over several years has
shown that, within the scope of the in-
quiries and in the absence of congenital
weaknesses or syphilis, the mother of
almost every child born deaf, and many
of those born blind, suffered from
rubella during the early months or mid-
months of pregnancy. Children attending
the school fall into fairly sharply-defined
age-groups, and, without exception, the
birth years of the various groups were
years of rubella epidemics.
In Queensland all such unfortunate
children become wards of the State, and
specialised education in well-equipped
boarding school is provided. But that is
not enough. A team of experts should be
commissioned to try to evolve a pre-
ventive treatment. Tax revenue is spent
on many less important things. — Jim
O’Keefe (Q.).
Repat. Hospitals
Unless the Federal Government ensures
an ample supply of nurses for repatria-
tion hospitals Australia’s sick, and weary
war veterans will have a long journey
back to normal health.
The Repatriation Commission has ad-
mitted it could place another 300 nurses
in Victoria and N. S. Wales alone, yet
the Government has done nothing to
alleviate the position. Several wards at
the Victorian Heidelberg Repatriation
Hospital have been closed because of
staff shortage. Men who should have
been able to convalesce in the hospital
have had to return home a few days
after leaving the operating theatre.
Evidently Immigration Minister Cal-
well considers nurse migrants to Aus-
tralia are unnecessary. He has only
brought out a handful, and they went
straight to private and big-city public
hospitals.
Immigration officers in Europe should
be told to search for women anxious to
come to Australia to nurse its Diggers.
The Federal Government has an inescap-
able obligation to give medical attention
to its ex-servicemen.— Waddlin’ Willie
(Vic.).
Lotteries
“A.D.” (B. 7/1/’4B) holds a brief for
gambling, but makes the usual bloomer
of confusing it with “business.” Is the
life-insurance business a gamble? The
company certainly takes a “risk,” but
everybody interested in the policy obtains
a benefit and nobody loses a penny. In
a lottery every “investor” loses except
a few who have rendered no service in
return for their rake-off.
A bob-in sweep, added to a ticket in a
“consultation” and a punt on the races,
is often the last straw that breaks the
back of the family budget in thousands of
homes. Ask the women who do the
budgeting if it “hurts.”
As for gambling being “inherent,” the
same could be said of human frailty in
general. What “A.D.” soft-pedals or
ignores is the fact that all lotteries of any
kind or size are uneconomic and anti-
social, enriching the few at the expense
of the many. If the losers get a “kick”
out of them that is certainly all they get.
Selling one’s salary for a kick is not
business at all, but only h short-cut to
bankruptcy. — Mug (S.A.).
“Don’t Keep Talking”
The Communist method of dragging
out the Victorian railwaymen in the abor-
tive Melbourne strike was of the usual
mob-dazing sort. At the Newport work-
shops the Communist Brown tried to in-
flame a meeting of 500 by saying that the
railway union was “high priority on the
Government’s list for the next attack.”
He then asked if anyone wanted to put
any questions:
Unionist; “What did the tramwaymen
do to support us?”
Brown: “Don’t keep talking about what
the tramwaymen did. That’s what the
Hollway Government wants you to do.”
A voice: “Will the A.R.U. pay us strike
pay?”
Brown: “You don’t expect me to tell
you what we’re going to do, do you? Last
time we got what we wanted by calling
out a key section.”
So are strikes made and extended by the
extremists whom the unions elect to
executive office. Less than nothing to
them are the misery and bankruptcy they
cause. — Merbein (Vic.).
Flytrap
When I was a child I spent an idle
hour watching flies getting caught on a
sticky flypaper. I wasn’t surprised at the
first few being duped, but my wonder
grew as hundreds followed them to their
doom. Each new arrival could see the
agonised struggles of those already in
trouble, but they seemed quite eager to
share their fate. So I asked my dad to
explain the mystery.
“Quite simple, sonny,” he said. “Every
fly has a thousand eyes, but he can’t see
further than his nose. He thinks he sees
a chance of getting something for noth-
ing, plenty of tucker without working or
searching for it, so he hops right in for
his cut. By the time he gets well stuck
into it it’s too late to pull out.
“It’s an old dodge, but it works equally
well with men. If you promise them
everything for nothing or without work-
ing for it they’ll take a chance. Whole
nations have been caught that way, but
there’s always more flies and plenty more
promises. Get another paper, sonny —
that qne’s full up.”—Buzz (S.A.).
Golden Age
As long as the popular cry is “shorter
hours and more pay,” we will continue
to find things hard. Houses for the
people is a daily cry, and yet few young
couples are able to build because costs
have nearly trebled since 1939. The rise
is explained to some extent by the
lethargic attitude of workmen—it was a
very poor bricklayer who did not lay
between 800 and 1000 bricks a day be-
fore the war ; now one man in N.S.W.
may not lay more than 200.
There are more men in industry than
ever before, and materials are available
in a limited quantity. Anyway, lack of
materials on a job should mean the
cutting-down of labor, but we find the
exact reverse. Unions can demand, and*
get away with, such piratical rules as
the laying of only 200 bricks per day.
Where does this attitude come from?
This lethargy is not only in the building
trade* but in almost every walk of life.
Pre-war courtesy is gone because jobs are
easy to get—no one who left school in
the pre-war days could walk into a job
and earn £3 to £4 a week.
The natural question is “How long will
it last?” Golden Ages have always been
followed by Dark Ages, and history has a
nasty habit of repeating itself.—A.P. C.
(A.C.T.).
Root of the Matter
The Government’s order that Aus-
tralian women working for the Americans
in Japan and Guam must come home at
once is as dictatorial as Russia’s re-
fusal to allow Russian wives to join their
British husbands. Manpower controls
went out a few years ago, and the Gov-
ernment has no power to direct anyone
as to where they shall work or for whom
they shall work. It seems to, be a case of
petty official dictatorship with the bless-
ings of Mr. Calwell. — Simple Simon
(N.S.W.).
That Australian vote with Russia which
helped to defeat the British move at
U.N.O. to unite Russian wives and their
British husbands (B. 21/1/ ’4B) was fol-
lowed by an almost apologetic “explana-
tion.” The vote, it was stated by a Gov-
ernment spokesman, was in keeping with
Australia’s policy of deporting the
Malayan husbands of Australian women
from this country. There may be a
parallel, but it’s hard to see. And it’s
certainly impossible to reconcile the Aus-
tralian vote at U.N.O. with the Govern-
ment’s action in allowing misguided
young Australian women to join their
dusky husbands in Java —most of them
were disillusioned ' only tpo quickly.—
Oliver Filter (N.S.W.),
The review (B. 7/1/’4B) of The Parlia-
ment of Tasmania refers to Clark as a
“co-inventor” of the Hare-Clark voting-
system. That is an injustice to the
memories of both Hare and Clark. Hare,
who gave the idea to the world in 1859,
was the “inventor” of the system, advocat-
ing its application to a whole country as
one whole constituency. Clark adapted it
to apply to constituencies of manageable
proportions —in the case of Tasmania,
when first applied (January 20, 1897), to
Hobart and Launceston —and originated
an adjustment of Hare’s “quota” to suit
those conditions. Just over 50 years ago
it was used for the first time in the British
Empire (in Tasmania) and it has been the
basis of the Assembly electoral law in
Tasmania since 1907. To, Hare rightly
belongs the honor as author of the sys-
tem ; ta Clark its first practical applica-
tion.—C. I. Clark (Tas.).
The controversy between the motor-
trade people and the Minister for
Customs, Senator Courtice, is amusing.
The Senator must be blind and deaf if
he doesn’t know what goes on in the
second-hand-car racket. He should go to
a State where he is not known and spend
a day trying to buy a second-hand car at
the pegged price. I tried to buy a light
used car, and £lOO over the pegged price
was the cheapest offer I received. I gave
up the idea. —B. F. (N.S.W.).
