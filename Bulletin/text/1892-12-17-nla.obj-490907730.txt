ESTABLISHED in 1886.
This eminent Specialist is a graduated physician of
Harvard University, U.S., registered by the Governments
of N.S.W. and N.Z., and has devoted Sixteen Years
to the special study of the CHRONIC and SKIN
DISEASES of MEN and WOMEN. All applying
to him will receive his honest opinion of their com-
plaints. No experimenting ; no mercury used. A posi-
tive cure guaranteed or forfeit t'2oo. His vast experience
tells him that where there is no organic disease, and
nothing but an inorganic trouble, or, in other words, a
conglomeration of symptoms producing a certain result,
there is no reason why it cannot be removed with the
proper remedies ; therefore he guarantees. He claims to
be the most skilful ana successful physician in N.S.W. in
his particular speciality, viz., the CHRONIC DISEASES
of MEN and' WOMEN.
Examination and Advice Free to all.
Office Hours : 10 to l‘i u.iu. ; 2to 4 and
7 to 8 p.m.
In consequence of the prevailing
HARD TIMES,
Dr. SPEER has determined to REDUCE his FEES to
exactly ONE-HALF of those usually charged, and he
trusts that this will prove itself
GOOD NEWS INDEED
(o those thousands of poor but honest sufferers, who,
though willing to pay a small fee proportionate to their
means are quite unable to pay the enormous charges so
often made.
Dr. SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
■curable case in hand he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
completely cured. It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.
NERVOUSNESS.
CONSULT Dr. SPEER in all cases of NERVOUSNESS
■ and WEAKNESS, for his many years of practice with
these diseases enables him to remove all traces of them,
and to return the victims to full VIGOR and HEALTH.
N.B.—TWENTY SHILLINGS is sufficient to
send for remedies necessary for the cure of
NERVOUSNESS and WEAKNESS.
In all cases of
"WEAKNESS consult Dr. SPEER.
HAVER AND KIDNEY COMPLAINTS consult Dr.
SPEER.
ASTHMA consult Dr. SPEER.
•BLOOD DISORDERS consult Dr. SPEER.
SKIN DISEASES consult Dr. SPEER.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Chap. I.—Thk Bbryggeses and the Gaffneys.
It was an evening in November. The rays of
the setting sun shone softly on the western
windows of Bbrygges Towers, a stately mansion
standing within its own grounds in the splendid
and exclusive suburb of Toorak. By one of these
windows in the full glory of the sunset sat
Waratah, the heiress of the House of Bbrygges,
like a fair picture in a golden frame. Beside her,
on a Japanese table, lay an open book, from
which she read in tones of deep reverence the
following weird lines
The blazoned banners shuddered in the hall,
The arras shook upon the panelled wall,
The hot blood of the revellers ran cold,
And fear did to their lips the flagons clue ;
But only those within whose veins the blue
Be Boos blood ran the spectre might behold,
Whose ghastly advent ever did foretell
Some woe to the great House it loved so well.
“I shall speak to pa about the matter —I mean
the spirit—this evening,” she murmured, enigma-
tically, as she closed the book and rose from her
seat by the window.
It would have been hard to find within the
bounds of the seven provinces a handsomer maiden
than Waratah Bbrygges as she appeared at this,
moment. She was a superb, but serious brunette,
with dark, earnest eyes, and a colour in her
cheeks like a reflected glow from the flower of the
waratah. Her curious Christian name had been
chosen by her mother, partly out of patriotism,
but chiefly from motives of romance. This
romantic taste she had transmitted to her
daughter, who had carefully developed it by a
judicious course of reading, comprising the
historical novels of Scott, Lytton, Harrison
Ainsworth, G. P. R. James, Miss Jane
Porter, and others too numerous to mention.
Her pretty head was stuffed with tales of chivalry,
and knights in armour with flashing swords and
tossing plumes galloped through her dreams. She
was, moreover, proud beyond measure of her name
and noble pedigree—of which, more anon—but
for all that inclined a not inattentive ear to the
wooing of young Tom Gaffney, the only son of a
neighbouring magnate, who was a first-rate
athlete but no hero of romance. She had, it is
true, treated his suit somewhat coldly at first,
being under the impression that his family was of
lowly origin, but this unjust suspicion was
startlingly dispelled one evening when he made
his appearance at their usual try sting-place, in
company with a hired man wheeling a barrow
containing a huge roll of thick, wliite paper,
covered with strange hieroglyphics.
“ What is it, Tom?—some new design in wall-
paper?” she enquired, wonderingly,
“No,” he replied with dignity, “it’s my pedi-
gree,” and, nodding to his attendant, said, “Pay
out.” Whereupon the hired man turned himself
in the shafts of the barrow and walked slowly
down the garden-path, reeling the paper out
behind him as he went. When he came to a turn-
ing in the path, Tom cried, “Halt !”and marching
down to the barrow, then some 40 yards away,
gravely inspected the roll, which was but little
diminished in size. He then returned to where he
had left Waratah standing with an expression of
mingled amazement and awe upon her charming
features, and observed, in tones wherein she
fancied she could detect a slight touch of hauteur,
“ That takes the Gaffney family back to the time
of Moses when they were Kings of Kerry. Shall
I tell him to pay out any more? ”
“No,” she answered faintly, “that’s more than
sufficient.”
And so it was. She had treated him as an
equal in blood if not in sex ever since that even-
ing. Her father, however, looked upon the affaire
dc canir with different eyes. He had higher things
in view for his daughter than, as he said himself,
marrying the son of old Pat Gaffney.
A few words of explanation are necessary here.
Bbrygges and the elder Gaffney had been friends
and partners in the early days of the diggings but
had quarrelled bitterly over some trifling matter—
a barmaid, young Gaffney said, but his parent said
it was the colour of a horse —and become enemies
for the rest of their lives. Bdth had prospered
remarkably well, but Bbrygges had a higher con-
ception than Gaffney of what was due to Society,
and, as ho rose in the social scale, had added a
letter to his name from time to time. He had, by
singular ill-luck, failed to obtain a title—though
he had done all that mere colonial man can do to
deserve one —and consoled himself with these
innocent amplifications of his signature, which
were, however, an unfailing subject of derision to
his former partner. It galled Bbrygges to theqnkk
to think that the latter had
known him as plain bald
Briggs, though he was in
the habit of informing his
■ friends, in confidence, that
the additions referred to had only
restored a portion of the pristine
glory of his patronymic, and that
he was entitled to put “ De ” before
it if he chose.
This assertion was not made with-
out good reasons in black and white,
argent, or, and gu/es. He had,
shortly after taking his place among
theToorak aristocracy, written to a
certain distinguished and eminently
complaisant genealogist at ‘ ‘ Horae,”
to send him particulars of pedigree, together with
bill for same, and, in reply, had received a diagram
of a Family Tree —which looked like an instan-
taneous photograph of a stringy-bark struck by
lightning—showing that he was descended from
King Alfred (in common with another illustrious
Anglo-Australian) through Eadgy tha, who married
Jone-de-Fer (Iron-cheek) de Bbrygges, who came
over with the Conqueror. According to this
reliable record, a De Bbrygges (Sir Hugo) had
accompanied Richard Coeur-de-Lion to the
Crusades, and another would have appended his
mark to the Great Charter at Runnymede,
when the barons bearded King John, if he had
been sufficiently sober on that celebrated occasion.
Subsequent De Bbryggeses upheld the power and
glory of the House till the Civil War, when the
family estates were confiscated by Cromwell.
Charles the Second, who was an absent-minded
monarch, forgot to restore them when he himself
was restored. After this the family fell into
obscurity and dropped the “De ” before their
name, which was by degrees denuded of spare
letters till it assumed its modern form of Briggs.
This valuable information was accompanied
by an illuminated coat of arms, crest, and
other heraldic furniture proper to the
family, and—the bill of costs as requested.
Bbrygges, though communicative enough with
regard to the other items said nothing about the
bill—not even to his wife or daughter. Old Pat
Gaffney hooted at the pedigree when he heard of
it, and suborned Dick Loder, a friend of his son
Tom, who was very clever with his pencil, to make
a caricature of the Bbrygges Family Tree, which
caricature he (old Pat) had hungup in his bedroom
in order that he might relieve his feelings by
throwing at it boots, glasses, empty bottles, and
other missiles of a similar character, when he was
laid up with the gout.
Young Tom did not like this, you may be
sure—for was not Waratah the glorious and
perfect fruit of the subject of the carica-
ture, and was not he, Tom, in love with her
more than any other man was ever in love with
any other woman since the beginning of the
world ? Most certainly, but though old Pat was
well aware of this interesting fact, he was not the
man to be baulked of his humour for fear of hurt-
ing the love-sick susceptibilities of his son. And
so while the latter, when he could not contrive an
excuse to see her, went mooning about the place in
a perpetual day-dream of which Waratah was the
central figure, the former continued to bombard
Dick Loder’s preposterous cartoon —which, by the
way, represented several alleged ancestors of
Bbrygges hanging from branches of the Tree in
various uncomfortable positions, but chiefly by the
neck—with unabated vigour and virulence. Tom
tried to quarrel with Dick over this graceful
flight of fancy, but when Waratah asked him
some leading questions about his own pedigree he
was glad to fall back on Dick’s inventive genius
with the result previously described in the Episode
of the Hired Man, the Wheelbarrow, and the
Roll of Paper. He felt ashamed of himself while
carrying out this deception, for he was by nature
an honest and ingenuous youth, but he also felt
that he could be guilty of even worse things for
the sake of winning a smile of favour from the
proud red lips of Waratah Bbrygges.
It should be said here that Bbrygges pere,
though he had his weaknesses, was not the man to
extend his vendetta against the elder Gaffney to
young Tom. On the contrary, he had a real
liking for the latter —which, however, didn’t go
so far as to wish to have him as a son-in-law. He
had, as said before, higher things than this in view
for his daughter. But it sometimes happens in
this free country that while the father proposes
the daughter disposes. And Waratah had disposed
of her heart to young Tom. Her father, who was
not blind to the state of affairs between the couple,
knew that there was only one way of causing an
estrangement between them—namely, by working
on the family pride of his daughter. How she
herself played unconsciously into the hands of her
wily parent will be seen in the next chapter.
Chap. 11.--Waratah’,s Wish.
“ Papa !”
“ Yes, dear.”
“You told me I was to make up my mind as
soon as I liked as to what I wished you to give me
for a Christmas present.”
“ 1 did-well?”
“Well, I h ive made up my mind.'’
“I am delighted to hear you say so, my dear.
And what shape is the present to take?”
“ It is to take—don’t be frightened, papa t—the
shape of a ghost.”
“ A WHAT?”
“ A GHOST.”
Old Bbrygges lay back in his arm-ch dr an i
laughed till the tears ran down his red face.
-‘-Well, well,” he said at last, seeing that his
daughter was regarding him with an unmoved
countenance, “a. ghost ia..about the rummiest
(though an aristocrat Bbrygges had his vulgar
moments) Christmas box I've ever heard a young
woman ask for. Are you sure that nothing less
than a ghost—though I don’t see how there could
be much less—will suit you ? Wouldn’t a skeleton
on wires answer as well ?”
“ Rapa —l am serious if you are not.”
“ Don’t be offended, my dear. If you must
have a ghost you shall have one. I think I have
sufficient influence with the theatrical managers
for that, anyhow. Would you prefer to have
Banquo’s ghost, the ghost of Hamlet’s father, or
the ghost that walks on treasury-day?”
“ Papa, this is no jesting matter. I want a real
family ghost. We have been without one too long
as it is. All old families of any account have
them, and I’m sure our family is old enough to
have several. Can’t you remember any traditions
about a ghost appearing, from time to time, in the
corridors, or on the battlements of our family seat
in England to give warning of some danger
menacing our house? Try to remember, papa, for
my sake. ”
Bbrygges made what appeared to be a herculean
effort to remember, but had to give it up at last,
and replied in some confusion ; “The fact is, my
love, I was too young and thoughtless then to pay
much attention to spirits of that description.
And —er —to tell the truth, I can't remember hear-
ing any traditions of the sort you mention.”
The good old gentleman was too careful of his
daughter’s feelings to wound them by telling her
that the family seat in England was hardly big
enough to contain the live Briggses of the day,
let alone having space to spare for the dead
Briggses to wander around in.
Waratah looked grievously disappointed, and
tears began to gather in her eyes.
This was more than Bbrygges could bear, and,
putting his arm around her waist, he said;
“There, there, Warry, don’t take on about it.
You shall have a ghost, or, as Hamlet says in the
play, ‘By Heaven I’ll make a ghost of him that
lets me.’ And now give me a kiss and run away
and dress for dinner.”
Late that evening Mr. and Mrs. Bbrygges sat on
the balcony in the moonlight talking about
Waratah’s curious fancy.
“She says that a family without a ghost isn’t
worth mentioning,” remarked Mr. Bbrygges. “Is
that so, Sarah ?”
“ Oh, yes,” replied his wife. “ All the genuine
old families have them. My family has always
had a ghost.”
Mrs. Bbrygges was a Tasmanian Ffolliott—a
clan whose members were in the habit of spelling
their surname with a surplusage of consonants, as
if they wished thereby to impress common Smiths
and Browns with the idea that the Ffolliotts were
great people in the land, and had the run of the
alphabet when the English language was first
invented—and seldom missed an opportunity of
reminding her husband of this fact, even going so
far at times as to hint that he had taken the idea
of the double B in Bbrygges from the double F in
her maiden name : an insinuation which, we need
hardly say, he rejected with scorn.
“Then, by thunder !” he exclaimed, slapping his
thigh with his thick palm, “the Bbryggeses shall
have a ghost of their own, if I have to make one
of somebody with my own hand!”
“ Oh, don’t say that, John,’’said Mrs. Bbrygges,
“and don’t roll your eyes in that dreadful way.
You frighten me.”
But Bbrygges’s pride was aroused, and there was
so much of it that, once up, there was no telling
when it would subside again. A lurid light—the
dawn of some terrible thought—crept into the
corners of his eyes. His wife watched him with
mingled amusement and alarm. Could he be
really contemplating some desperate deed ?
“Sarah,” he whispered, hoarsely, at last, “I
think I’ll kill old Pat. Gaffney !”
Mrs. Bbrygges drew a long breath of relief. He
had been threatening to do this for years, and she
felt reassured when she heard the old, familiar
menace again.
“No,” he said, after along interval, during
which the lurid light died slowly out of his eyes,
“on second thoughts, I won’t kill him. His ghost
would make the house uninhabitable.” He paused
and looked at his wife, as if he expected her to say
something.
“ Why ?” she asked.
“Because,” he replied, triumphantly, “it would
smell so infernally of brimstone !”
He chuckled at this joke so heartily that his
wife had to rise from her chair and slap him on the
back to keep him from choking.
“Well,” he remarked when he recovered his
breath, “ I’ve never disappointed Warry yet, so a
ghost I’ll have to get—by hook or by crook.”
“ It would be nice to have a ghost for Christmas,
John,” said Mrs. Bbrygges, in amusing tone. “It
would be so unique and recherche, you know—but
I’m afraid I should feel creepy if it were in the
house. Perhaps ” —here a happy thought struck
her—“perhaps we could induce it to haunt the
stables.”
Mr. Bbrygges shook his head dubiously. “I
don’t think,” he said,* “ you could ask the sort of
ghost that Warry wants to do that, Sarah,”
‘**Have you any idea in your mind as to how you
will procure it?”
“ Not the faintest—not even a ghost of an idea.
Ha ! ha!”
“ Ha ! ha !” echoed Mrs. Bbrygges, hollowly.
“But I’ll find out, never fear. Money ” he
rattled the coin in his pocket as he enunciated
this nineteenth-century axiom—“ money, my dear,
can do anything.”
Char. lll.— The Hiring of the Ghost.
Now, how did Dick Loder learn that a ghost
was wanted in the Bbrygges family ? Nobody
knows, and nobody could ever find out. But he
was aware of the fact on the day following the
conversation reported in the previous chapter, and
at once communicated the news to the elder
Gaffney, between whom and himself there existed
an occult sympathy and understanding beautiful
to behold. A nod was as good as a wink to either,
coming from the other, because both belonged, by
virtue of a rare twist in the temperament born
with them, to the great Freemasonry of Humour.
And so it came to pass that the Old Wag and the
Young Wag laid their wicked heads together and
evolved a plot.
Next morning, when Mr. Bbrygges was opening
his letters at breakfast, he found in one of the
envelopes a card, inscribed as follows :
CHUNDER I) ASS,.
Practical Mahalfna and Ghost Purveyor,
13 Mediaeval Chambers.
Collins Street,
MELBOURNE.
Mr. Bbrygges looked perplexed. Then he
smiled, and put the card in Ins pocket without
saying a word to either his wife or daughter.
Two hours later he was standing mr tirotmtersidm
of a green baize curtain in the office of Mr.
Ohunder Dass, waiting for the appearance of that
eminent dealer in the supernatural. He had not
to wait long. The curtain was slowly drawn
aside, and he was face to face with the Mahatma.
“Be seated, Mr. Bbrygges,” said the latter,
politely, “I have been expecting you.”
Bbrygges sank down, a loose heap of
awe - stricken astonishment, on the nearest
chair, and gazed in goggle - eyed silence at
the weird figure before him. It was well
for him at that moment that he was a man
of temperate habits. This was what he saw.
A tall personage, dressed in a high yellow hat or
mitre, of pentagonal form, with blood pentacles
painted in front and at each angle, and a yellow
gaberdine, with a red dragon rampant on the
breast, and a scroll-work of serpents swallowing
each other around its borders. This garment,
which had much the look of a crazy quilt produced
in a lunatic asylum, was bound round the middle
with a girdle, inscribed with the signs of the
Zodiac. Very little of the face of the figure was
visible, owing to the upper part being hidden by
a pair of enormous smoked spectacles, and the
lower part concealed by a long white beard. But
the voice was pleasant, and seemed curiously
familiar to Mr. Bbrygges.
“You are looking for a ghost, I think?” said
the Figure, cheerfully.
Bbrygges, who had by this time recovered from
his astonishment, replied in the affirmative. Then
a thought struck him suddenly, and he said,
“ May I ask if you are the sender of this card ? ”
—showing the card he had received a couple of
hours before.
“ Yes,.” was the answer, “I am Chunder Dass,
at your service.”
“But how did you know I wanted a ghost?”
exclaimed Bbrygges.
Chunder Dass smiled —there was just room for a
smile between his spectacles and his beard.
“That is a professional secret,” he said, “and
now, as I have not much time to spare—l have
be at a meeting of Mahatmas in Thibet this even-
ing—perhaps you will ”
“Oh, certainly,” gasped Bbrygges, “let’s get to
business. I wouldn't have you miss your appoint-
ment on my account for anything.”
“Well, then,” observed the Ghost Purveyor,
“the question is—What sort of a ghost do you
require ? ”
“ It’s my daughter’s fancy, not mine,” murmured
Bbrygges, “she wants a family ghost.”
“Just so—and a very proper tiling to want,
too,” remarked the Mahatma rubbing his hands
together like a shopman, “I make a speciality of
ghosts of this class, and have supplied spectres to
some of the first families of Australia. Would
you like to have the spectre of a lady—time of
Charles ll.—that glides through passages and
corridors, pointing to the blood stains on the front
of its dress, and moaning in a way to make your
heart break ? ”
Mr. Bbrygges shook his head and said he
thought a ghost of that sort would be too depress-
ing to have in the house as a permanent visitor.
“ Perhaps you’d like to go further back in
history,” said Chunder Dass. “If so, I think I
have the very article to suit you. It’s the ghost of a
baron who was beheaded during the wars of the
Roses, and it carries its head in its helmet like a
shin of beef in a soup-tureen.”
“ No, thank you—l think I’d rather have a ghost
with its head where it ought to be.”
“ But that is its little bit of ‘ business ’—and is
most effective, I believe, when sprung suddenly
on people who are inclined to be nervous, or have
a touch of heart-disease. It’s very quiet, too, and
gave great satisfaction to the last family it was
with ”
“ Why did it leave, then ?” interrupted Bbrygges
a second time.
“ Well, you see, its a ghost that’s very fond of
children —I think it must have been a family man
itself when it was in the flesh—and it was always
wanting to get into the nursery to play with the
baby. One day it left its head in the cradle to
amuse the youngster when it woke up. Youngster
was frightened into convulsions. After that, of
course, the family had to choose between the ghost
and the baby. They chose the baby, as was, per-
haps, natural, and the ghost had to go. It must
have got very much attached to them because they
told me afterwards that when it was leaving its
helmet was running over with tears, as if it had
been making gravy of its head.”
“ Very touching,” said Bbrygges, “but I don’t
think my daughter would care for that kind of
ghost. She would consider it too maudlin.”
“ Ah, I see —young lady wants something more
romantic. Well, I have a most superior appari-
tion —said to be the ghost of a nobleman murdered
in the Tower during the reign of Richard lII.
whose/orie is to wander round the house it may
be haunting at the time, clanking its chains and
shrieking, ‘ blood ! blood ! blood ! —buckets of
blood !’ Do you think the young lady would fancy
that class of ghost?”
“No,” replied Bbrygges, drily, “neither would
I. It would be too exciting for a quiet household
like mine.”
“Never mind,” said Chunder Dass', with a
smile, “ I have many more on my list. There is,
for instance, the Ghost of a Crusader—it’s in
Europe just now with a family that went home a
year ago, but it’s engagement expires to-morrow.
They have written to inform me that they are
unable to renew the engagement because of the.
eldest daughter having married an eminent
scientist who doesn't believe in a future state, and
who would, therefore, be annoyed if he saw the
ghost. Do you think this one would do?”
“Yes, I daresay,” replied Bbrygges, wearily,
“ but 1 want it at once.”
“ You shall have it to-morrow evening, Mr.
Bbrygges,” remarked Chunder Dass, with a polite
bow.
“Thank you. But may I ask how you manage
the business. You can’t send a ghost by cable-
•gram, eh ?”
“ No, but we can send it or recall it by astral
current, which is much quicker—ever so much
quicker. Didn’t you hear Colonel Olcott when he
was in Melbourne ?”
“No,” replied Bbrygges, with a half-stifled
yawn. “I don’t take much interest in military
matters.”
Chunder Dass smiled. “Well, it is of no con-
sequence,” he said, “but, if you think you have
made up your mind to engage the last-mentioned
ghost, I will let it know, and you will find it
waiting for you to-morrow night when you go
home. I suppose you have a room ready for it?”
“A room for a ghost ?”
“ Certainly. Did you ever hear of a ghost—of
course, I am speaking of a highly-connected ghost
—that hadn’t a secret chamber of its own to
which it might retreat when it grew tired of
haunting backstairs and corridors and passages?
I believe there are some vulgar spectres—spooks,
I think they arc called by the common persons
whose houses they haunt—that are content to pass
the hours of daylight in old tanks, boxes, and
even barrels, but I never heard of a ghost of a
good family coTnnYg' down so low. I’m very sure
none of mine would.”

Mr. Bbrygges chuckled inwardly at this remark.
He was thinking of his wife’s suggestion to him to
get a ghost that would haunt the stables.
Then he said, “It won’t have any reason to
complain about want of accommodation in my
house, Mr. Dass, I assure you. It can have the
whole run of the top-storey to itself. Also, of a
private staircase which is never used leading from
the top of the west turret to the garden below.
And now, about the terms ?”
“ You shall have the ghost for a month on trial
—it is a rule I make. If you are satisfied with it
at the end of that time we will draw out the
engagement for any period you like.”
“ That is more than fair, Mr. Dass. I will now
say good-day.”
“ Good-day, Mr. Bbrygges. Is there any ques-
tion you would like to ask me before you go ? ”
“ Well—er—l hope you won’t think me imper-
tinent, but I've been wondering why you wear
such enormous smoked spectacles.”
“ I wear them for two reasons,” was the reply.
“ In the first place, because some of the ghosts I
huvfi to deal with are so attenuated that even I
Cali see them only through extra large glasses, and
in the second place, because others of them are
not good to look at through a clear medium —I
refer to tho e that come from .” He paused
and pointed significantly at the door.
“ Thank yom I understand,” said Bbrygges—
“ t hope ydur Crusader isn’t one of these.”
“Oh dear no. It 'is a ghost of excellent moral
character —for a Crusader’s ghost, of course—and
i, merely under the necessity of walking the earth
for a time on account of a few peccadilloes, such
as the flaying alive of certain Jews who refused to
advance moneys to the good knight, while in the
lies'll, to enable him to make a figure befitting his
i-ank at the Holy Wars-simple errors of judg-
ment, in fact, such as any cf us might make in
similar circumstances.”
“ You take a weight off my mind, Mr. Dass.
Once more, good-day.”
Was it an hallucination, or did old Bbrygges
really —as he cast a farewell glance behind him
whin leaving the Chamber of Mystery —behold
the August Adept to whom he had been talking
performing a wild eurrobboree on the carpet with
his pentagonal mitre tilted rakishly over his right
ear? _
Bbrygges, as he descended the stairs, decided
that it was an hallucination.
But he himself performed a strictly private
pirouette before passing out into the street, and,
catching a reflection of his face in the windows of
an office, bestowed upon it a wink of infinite
significance.
Chap. TV.— The Hon. Cikilmondeley Col-
quhoun.
After leaving the Mahatma; Bbrygges went to
his club, where he had ail appointment to meet
the Hon. Cholmondeley Colquhoun, to whom he
had been introduced a week or two before this
story opens, and whoso acquaintance, after learn-
ing that he was the second son of an Earl, he had
assiduously cultivated. Nothing could exceed the
delight of the good man when he found out how
his new friend spelt his name. What was
Bbrygges, or even Efolliott, as an orthographical
extravagance to the magnificent prodigality which
wrote a nanie pronounced Chumley Cohoon with
twenty-one letters? Hi: was perfectly respect-
able, too, was tho lion. Cholmondeley, and
Bbrygges, who had long cherished the idea of
allying himself with the English aristocracy
through the marriage of his daughter to one of its
scions, immediately began to dream dreams in
which lie saw himself, as a grandfather, dandling
on his knee a future carl with a name not unlike
Cholmondeley Bbrygges Efolliott Colquhoun.
“You have a ghost in your family, of,course,
Mr. Colquhoun? ” he said to his new friend.
The Hon. Cholmondeley smiled and replied :
“Oh, yes, I think so”—imagining that he was
answering an eccentric old millionaire according
to his humour.
Bbrygges grasped his hand and shook it warmly,
saying “I might have known you wouldn't be
without one.” And straightway he invited the
young English aristocrat to pay a visit to Bbrygges
Towers. “ We’ll expect you to-morrow,” he said,
as he took leave of him.
The Hon. Cholmondeley sat meditating for a
long time. “Yes,” he murmured, “we’ll go
Home to live —and leave tho old man behind in
Australia. He’s an ornament here; he’d be a
nuisance at Home. I wonder if she talks with a
twang ?”
Chap. V.—Th*e Ghost at Work.
They sat up late in Bbrygges Towers on the
following evening. The talk ran chiefly on here-
ditary spectres. Mrs. Bbrygges had told the story
of the Efolliott phantom, and the Hon. Cholraon-
deley (who arrived before dinner) had, with much
sprightliness of style, narrated the legend of the
Colquhoun apparition, and then the conversation
flickered out for want of fuel. Bbrygges said
nothing, but his face wore a look of disappoint-
ment. Waratah kept silence also, and from time
to time glanced reproachfully at her father.
Crash ! Clank ! Clank ! Clank !
Mrs. Bbrygges sprang nervously out of her
easy-chair. The Hon. Cholmondeley started up
and looked enquiringly at his host. Waratah had
already caught her father’s eye, and, with a cry of
delight, she rose and kissed him on the forehead.
“Burglars, John!” gasped Mrs. Bbrygges,
sinking back into her chair again.
“No, Sarah,” remarked her husband, with
dignity. “It’s tho Bbrygges family ghost.”
“Then it must have fallen down a flight of
stairs,” muttered tho Hon. Cholmondeley under
his breath.
There was silence for a moment, and then
another crash more terrific than the first.
“Fallen down a second flight of stairs,” mut-
tered the Hon. Cholmondeley to himself. “The
Bbrygges ghost is evidently intoxicated.”
“It’s coming nearer—it’s coming in I ” cried
Mrs. Bbrygges, in a suppressed shriek,
Mr. Bbrygges said “Don’t be alarmed—it
won’t hurt us—it belongs to the family, you
know.”
Waratah was certainly frightened, but she bore
up bravely, and there was a glimmer of triumph
in her dark eyes even in the midst of her fear.
The Hon. Cholmondeley sat smiling in a light,
sceptical way, regarding her admiringly the while.
Presently a hurried, trembling knock came to
the door, and the butler tottered into the room,
his usually rubicund face all pale and flabby—the
liquor*illumination, which was wont to shine and
burn there, faded out and dead —his knees knock-
ing together audibly. Behind him, in a shudder-
ing group, stood the rest of the servants.
_ “ Sir,” he said, “ Mr. Bbrygges, we’ve come to
give you notice immediate. We’re sorry, because
us and you got along together pretty well up to
now. But you’ve got somethin’ in the ’ouse
to-night which was never in it afore, and we can’t
live in the ’ouse with it, and that’s the long and
the short of it, and I ’ope you’ll take no offence.”
‘'What the devil do you mean, Higson.? ex-
claimed Mr. Bbrygges, affecting wrath and
astonishment. .
“Stand forth, Mnar, ousemaid, said lligson,
in a dignified tone, by way of reply, 'an tell the
master wot you sees wen you goes hupstairs to-
night to the hupper story.”
A young woman of coquettish appearance* but
evidently in a state of genuine terror, stepped out
from the throng of servants huddled together
behind the portly form of tae butler.
“Now, M’riar,” said thelatter, ‘ hout with it.
“I was goin’upstairs,” she gasped, “and I got
to the top-landin’, and wasgom’ down the passage
when I sees a figger comm towards me with its
arms spread out and its eyes blazm m its ed like
tram-lights—oh lor !”—and she threw her apron
over her head and began to sob hysterically at the
recollection,
“Describe wot it was like, Mnar, observed
Higson, who had, by tacit consent of the others,
assumed the office of cross-examiner.
She drew the apron from her face and replied in
broken accents: “It ’ad a great iron pot, with
feathers stuck in it, on its ’ed Waratah listened
eagerly “ and a iron jersey”— coat of mail,
murmured Waratah—“ and iron pants and sea-
boots, and it ’ad a great haxe with a spike at the
back in one ’and, an’ what looked like a big boiler-
lid with a cross painted on it on its left arm.
“ Sir Hugo, the Crusader,” exclaimed \V aratah,
and, rising from her seat, she flung her arms
around her father and wept tears of gratitude
that trickled down between his shirt collar and his
neck.
Nobody but her father understood what she
meant by the exclamation, and Higson took it
upon himself to request Maria not to be so realistic
in her description, because she was “frightenin’
the young lady.
“May I ask what the gentleman in the non
suit said to you?” enquired the Hon. Cholmon-
deley, speaking for the first time.
Maria, the housemaid, cast down her eyes and
played with tho hem of her apron. Then she
looked bashfully at her interrogator and an-
swered, “He —it asked me for a kiss, sir.
The Hon. Choimondeley placed his outspread left
hand— the hand nearest to Waratah—over his
eyes as if to concentrate his thoughts, and be-
stowed on M aria a lightning wink, which was by
no means wasted.
Some of the other servants were called, and,
although they did not profess to have seen the
Iron Apparition, they all declared that they had
heard the frightful racket it had made.
So yon sec, sir, said the butlei, when the
examination had come to an end, “ that wo can’t
“ What! a Crusader in jack boots!”
possibly stay in your service no longer. If the
ghost was a ornery ghost p’r’aps we could manage
to get used to it in time, but a cast-iron ghost is
more’n flesh and blood can stand. We wish
(taking a firm tone) “ to go to-morrow, if it’s not
inconveniencing you, Mr. Bbrygges.”
“ Go and be d — r d !” said Mr. Bbrygges, for-
getting his manners in his wrath.
AVhen the Hon. Cholmoudeiley Colquhoiui
retired to rest that night he found that his room
was on the top storey “ with a fine view of the
bay, and all Melbourne,” as his host informed
him. „ ....
“This is the ghost-walk, 1 suppose,” said the
Hon. Cholmondeley, taking his bedroom candle
(he had a prejudice against gas) from the trembling
hand of the housekeeper, when they had arrived
at the bottom of the flight of stairs which led to
the landing, and the haunted corridor in which
Maria, the housemaid, had met the armed phantom.
The housekeeper apologised for not accompanying
him any further, and he remarked, “never mind
'me, madam. We have all of us a ghost inside us,
and, if the worst comes to the worst, it is only a
question of trying whether this particular ghost is
a better ghost than mine. ” The mellow moon of
November was shining through the windows ot
his room, and her radiance lay in a flood upon the
carpet. “The ghost of gold,” he murmured,
smiling to himself at his own fancy.
Then he sat down in an armchair to smoke a
last cigar, and think.
“ Waratah !” he soliloquised, a strange but a
charming name ! She is more beautiful than I
expected. More beautiful! She is a dream a
wandering spirit from the realms of old romance.
I Would marry her to-morrow if she hadn’t a
penny.” , , , .
The Hon. Cholmondeley had never before given
utterance to such a disinterested sentiment.
Which shows how badly hit he was on this
occasion.
Chap. YL— The Ghost at Bay.
He was abruptly aroused from his pleasant
occupation of building castles in the moonlight,
by the sound of heavy footsteps, and the same
clanking which he had heard in the room below,
only that it now appeared to come from just
outside his door. His heart sprang into his throat
for a moment, and then he felt his scalp begin to
tighten, and his nostrils to twitch like the nostrils
of a scared animal. And then he lay back in his
chair and laughed softly. “ What an ass I am ! ”
he said to himself, “and I thought I was a philo-
sopher. Still, on reflection, it is possible to be
both. But to think that I should for an instant
be deluded into fancying that a ghost—an impalp-
able spirit—should bring its feet to the ground as
heavily as a fourteen-stone policeman ! ” And the
Hon. Cholmondeley, who, in spite of what he s'aid
to himself about himself, was courageous both by
constitution and culture, took up his candle and,
walking to the door, turned the handle sharply,
and looked out into the passage. There within
three yards of him stood the spectre, looking
almost as Maria the housemaid had described it,
except that a plumed helmet, and coat and hose of
mail, and a shield bearing the device of a red
cross, took the place of the homely articles which
appeared in her story. Also the spectre shone
with a lurid light which Maria had forgotten to
mention.
The Hon. Cholmondeley gazed at this awful
figure for a moment, and then retreated suddenly
into his room. Because he was afraid, after all ?
No, but because he wanted to light the gas.
“ Good Lord !” he chuckled, as he performed this
operation, “a Crusader in jack-boots !” The gas
being lit, he walked to the door, and, throwing it
wide open, said to the visitant from the other
world —“You must find it lonesome out there,
my friend. Come inside, and take a drink, and a
cigar, and then you can start on your beat again
if you wish.” All that the spectre vouchsafed by
way of reply was a hideous rattling of a chain,
which the Hon. Cholmondeley now observed it
carried over its right arm. “ I’ve some splendid
cigars, and you can have your choice of iced soda
or seltzer,” he continued, ooaxingly. The spectre
gave no answer, but stepped back into the dark-
ness of the passage, where it wavered and shim-
mered in a ghastly and appalling style.
“Well,” said the Hon. Cholmondeley, “if you
won’t come you won’t, but I may remark that I
have also a bottle of brandy, which I’m just about
to open.” So saying, he stepped back into his
room, and had the satisfaction of hearing the
footsteps of the spectre following him.
“I thought the brandy would fetch him,” mut-
tered the Hon. Cholmondeley, diving into his port-
manteau for a corkscrew.- After finding that
familiar yet wonderful utensil—the key of heaven
and hell—he said to the spectre, which loomed
terrific in the doorway, “Sit down, dear boy, and
make yourself at home. You must be tired
carrying around that heap of old iron. Also, put
up your visor and be sociable.”
But the spectre did not sit down, neither did it
put up its visor, nor
become sociable. On
the contrary, as the
gaslight fell full upon
the clear-cut features of
the Hon. Cholraon-
deley, it seemed desir-
ous of returning to the
gloom from which it
had emerged. That
calm and unruffled aris-
tocrat mixed for him-
self a long, luxurious
drink of brandy and
seltzer, with ice in it,
lit a cigar, and sinking
down in an easy chair,
sipped and smoked
with an air of languid
enjoyment which would
have overcome the reso-
lution of an anchorite.
The temptation was
too strong for the
spectre-it fell igno-
miniously. Three
strides brought it to
the table, and, stretch-
ing out an iron-plated
arm, it seized the
brandy bottle, and fil-
ling a tumbler drank
the contents raw, lift-
ing its visor just high
enough to do so com-
fortably. Then, with
a great clatter, it
dropped into a chair
near the door, and sat
immovable, with one
iron-clad leg crossed
over the other.
The Hon. Cholmon-
deley regarded these
proceedings with an
eye full of quiet amusement. He allowed
the spectre a few minutes wherein to over-
come its diffidence, and then arose, replenished
the empty tumbler with brandy, and, walk-
ing over to where it was sitting, with solemn
courtesy handed the liquor to his silent guest.
The latter tossed off the drink at a draught.
“ H’m,” muttered the Hon. Cholraondeley, as he
replaced the tumbler on the table, “old Bbrygges
must have made a mistake in some way; this
apparition ought to be haunting a distillery.
“Come now,” he said, after he had re-seated
himself, “you have had liquor enough to loosen
your toneme, even if you were the phantom of a
petrified Trappist. Do me the favour of informing
me whom I have the honour of entertaining?
“Sir Hugo de Bbrygges,” replied the Spectre,
in hollow tones.
“Happy to meet you, Sir Hugo. You are a
Crusader, I perceive, by the device on your shield.”
“You bet I was —I mean certainly,” responded
the Spectre.
“Ah ! ” said the Hon. Cholmondeley, placing
the tips of his fingers together, “this grows in-
teresting. X have often wished to find out the
truth about those famous filibustering expeditions
known in history as the Crusades. I'ne accounts
given in standard works on the subject are vague
and confusing. But you were an eye-witness, and
you can tell me what the facts really were. I m
very glad to have met you. Permit me to fill your
glass again.” ... , ~ ,
The spectre offered no objection and swallowed
the liquor as before, exposing a stubbly, brick-
coloured beard in doing so.
The Hon. Cholmondeley made a silent note of
this feature and continued, “I would like, to
begin with, to know your private opinion about
SaTadin. To me he has always seemed the most
fascinating figure of his age.” .
The spectre shuffled its feet uneasily and emitted
a husky cough. It was evidently suffering from
embarrassment. Its host, however, affected not
to observe this, and said pleasantly, “ Perhaps
your memory has grown rusty about Saladin—
any memory would be likely to grow rusty if it
were shut up in an old helmet as long as yours
seems to have been. But you ought to remember
the defence of Acre by Sir Sydney Smith at any
rate.,”. . .
The spefitre replied in a fretful tone that it
“ had no head for names,” but now that it had
been reminded of the incident it recollected Sir
Sydney Smith very well. He was—here it became
more animated—a red-whiskered man and a great
smoker. Could cut a Turk in two with his battle-
axe and without taking the pipe out of his mouth.
The Hon. Cholmondeley listened to _ this
reminiscence of the Holy Wars with unfeigned
enjoyment,
“ Who put you up to this game?” he observed
at length.
“ What game ? ” flatteringly enquired the
spectre.
“Why, the game of playing ghost—and the
Ghost of a Crusader ! He might, at least, have
had some respect for the unities, if he had none
for you. Jack-boots on a Crusader I. Why you
are only fit to be a ghost in a pantomime. Now,
you’ll either let me know all about this swindle,
or I’ll go downstairs at once and tell what I have
discovered to Mr. Bbrygges, who will probably
send for the police.”
“ For Heaven’s sake don’t do that!” groaned the
spectre, falling on its knees.
The Hon. Cholmondeley hadn’t.the slightest
intention of carrying out his threat, but he never-
theless moved towards the door with a look-of
stern resolution in his eyes.
“ Why shouldn’t I ?” he said, “ you may be one
of a gang of burglars who intend to rob the house,
for all I know to the contrary.”
The spectre suddenly raised its vizor.
The Hon. Cholmondeley stepped back a pace in
genuine astonishment.
“Pontefract”{“Pumfret” was the pronuncia-
tion he gave to it).
“ Cholmondeley !”
They didn’t fall upon each other’s necks and
weep tears of joy, as brothers so long separated
should have done—if only for the sake of doing
justice to the dramatic situation—yet they were
brothers all the same.
“Take that d d pot off your head, and sit
down and tell me everything,” growled the Hon.
Cholmondeley. The sham spectre obeyed the
order, humbly enough, and revealed a weak but
good-natured visage, dominated by a nose of an
angry red colour, to which, when they were
charged with alcohol, the blood-corpuscles rushed
like torch-bearers to a bonfire. This nose was,
like an Egyptian obelisk, a history in itself—the
history of the decline and fall from respectability
of the Hon. Pontefract Colquhoun.
“Tell me all about it, Pum,” said his brother,
pushing the box of cigars towards him.
It was not much of a story. Pontefract had
been the black sheep of the family, and after
having irretrievably ruined his prospects at home,
had been sent out to Australia, where (as the
family were given to understand) the sheep were
nearly all black, and he would be in the fashion.
Of course, he had spent his money and had
become dead-broke a few weeks after landing.
And after that—well, he had lived on hope—and
charity—for the most part. Nobody had ever
offered him any work since his arrival until the
previous day when a gentleman came to him and
told him that he could put some money in his way
if he were willing to play the part of Family
Ghost for a number of nights. Of course he was
willing—and that explained why he was in
Bbrygges Towers.
“Do you know the name of this—this person
who hired you?” enquired his brother.
“He called himself Brown—but I don’t sup-
pose that was his real name,” was the reply.
“ Did he tell you what end lie had in view in
getting you to work this swindle ? ”
“ He said it was in connection with a wager,
and was only a joke. I didn’t ask him for any
further particulars.”
The Hon. Cholmondeley turned his brother’s
story over in his mind for a few minutes, and at
length came to the conclusion that old Bbrygges
was at the bottom of the plot, though it was hard
to sec what his purpose was.
“ Well, as you’re in for it, you had better play
out the game, Pum.—and I wouldn’t advise you
to be so heavy on the liquor in future. -AMhat
made you try to kiss the housemaid ?” ? c . -
The Hon. Pontefract looked his brother: in the
eyes and laughed. “ Because I was. getting lone-
some—and because she was so doosid pretty, 1 ’ he
replied.
“ Well, you managed to give her a fine fright—
and I don’t wonder at her being seared, poor girl,
when she saw you. Why, you nearly scared me/”
“ I forgot all about the rig I was in,” said the
Hon. Pontefract, apologetically. “ I fell down
twice in the passage, too, and had all I could do
to get up again, these d d things are so heavy.)’
“ Yes, the whole house heard you,” remarked
the other, drily. “By the way, that armour must
have been borrowed or stolen from an artist’s
studio. It’s not stage-armour, I’ll swear, anil
you’ve rubbed it with phosphorus, haven’t you?”
The Hon. Pontefract assented by a nod.
“ I may ask you for the loan of it one of these
nights, old man,” continued his brother; “I’ll
tell you my reasons later on. And now, hadn’t
you better camp in here to-night !”
“No, thanks,” replied the Spectre, rising and
shaking hands; “I’m all right in the lumber-
room.” \ ;
“ But what about provisions?”
“ Plenty there, thanks.”
“Well, good night—and don’t frighten the
girls again.”
“Good night!” And, with a wink—and the
brandy-bottle—the Spectre vanished.
Chap. YlL—Confidences.
The servants did not leave in a body next day,
as the butler had said they would ; nor did that
imposing functionary himself appear to bo taking
steps for an immediate departure. He bad bis
own reasons for this sudden change of mind. In
fact, Mr. Bbrygges bad sent for him early in the
morning, and had —with the air of one man of
science confiding an important secret to another—
informed him that the figure which Maria, the
housemaid, had taken for a ghost, was in reality
nothing more than an electro-biological automa-
ton, with which he (Mr. Bbrygges) was working
out certain curious scientific experiments. He
would rely upon Higson to keep the servants from
intruding on these experiments, if only for the
sake of their own safety, because, although the
automaton was not supernatural, it was better left
alone by those who didn’t understand its way of
working. Higson was highly flattered by having
the mystery explained to him in this manner—-
more flattered, indeed, than he would have been
had be understood the explanation. But this
was more than even Mr. Bbrygges himself did, as
it had been suggested to him by the Hon. Chol-
mondeley only a few minutes before, as a good
way of accounting to the servants for the presence
of the armour-plated figure in the upper storey.
Higson re told the tale in the servants’ hall with
embellishments and amplifications which, if lie
could have heard them, would have delighted the
heart of a comparative mythologist. There was
no further talk about leaving after that.
Mr. Bbrygges took the Hon. Cholmondeley into

his confidence—hot suspecting what little net d
there was for doing so —about the ghost, and they
became great friends. It was evident to the young
Englishman that his host would not be disinclined
to receive him as a son-in-law. But the Hon.
Cholmondeley, though he had a keen eye for the
main chance, did not belong to the class of for-
tune-hunters who care little for Idve as long as the
lucre is certain. He wanted both. He was an
epicure, in this as in other respects. Still, he kept
his vision cleat, and was never led astray by
his natural prejudice in his own favour. Arid he
could not help seeing that, although the heiress of
Bbrygges Towers appeared to like his company
and conversation, he had coiile too late on the
scene to make a serious impression on her heart—
that, lie felt rather than saw, was already in the
possession df some liickier Idver. It seenled td
him, tdo, from certain remarks his host had let
fall oil two dr three Occasions, that, this lover’s luck
did not cover the good will of Waratah’s father,
artd the latter did ndt require . much pumping
before he admitted that young Tom Gaffney was
the lover in-question. “ 1 have nothing against
the lad personally,” he said, “but his father is a
d——d old rascal and son of his shall never marry
daughter of mine with my consent.” And with
a snort of wrath Mr. Bbrygges dismissed the
subject.
THE ELDER GAFFNEY.
But the Hon. Cholmondeley did not dismiss it
from his thoughts so brusquely. What he had
heard had touched, the chord of chivalry in his
nature and he made up his mind to do all in his
power to increase his influence over his host in
order to assist, the lovers. This piece of Quixotism
would cost him nothing, as he knew that he could
never gain the girl for his own. It was, thus that
he tried to make excuses to hjs worldly self on
behalf of his better self because he was about to
perform a generous action. There are some men
who are never so much ashamed as when they
catch themselves red-handed in the doing of a
good,deed. The Hon, Oholmpndeley was a man
of this kind.
Chap. IX.— Tom’s Troubles,
On the afternoon of the following day Tom
Gaffney was walking with Waratah in the myrtle
avenue at the end of the garden furthest from the
house. They bad been having words. This is
often the way with lovers who have known each
other for a number of years. They quarrel almost
as much as if they were married. The English
visitor at Bbrygges Towers was the cause of the
little unpleasantness between Tom and Waratah
on this occasion.
“I don’t see, Tom,” said the latter, “what
objection you can possibly have to the Honorable
Chumley ”
“ The Honorable New-Chumley, you mean,”
remarked Tom in a tone of withering irony. It
was the ohly jest the poor fellow had ever
attempted—and yet she didn’t even smile at it.
“ You should not speak of your superiors in
that style, Mr. Gaffney,” she said severely—“you
would perhaps adopt a more respectful manner if
you knew that the Colquhoun family have a
ghost of their own.”
“ If they haven’t, they soon will have, unless
New-Chumley is mighty careful,” observed Tom
gloomily.
“ Don’t be tragic, Tom.”
“ I’m not tragic; but, Waratah, I love you,” he
exclaimed passionately, taking her two hands in
his own; “ You, yourself ’not your father’s
money- not even your own beauty—but you kuqw
what I mean better than I do myself. T would'
love you just as much,” he concluded incoherently,
“ if—if you had a wooden leg.”
Waratah turned her face aside to hide her emo-
tion. But the task was too much for her.
When she looked at Tom again her eyes were filled
with tears—of laughter.
“Oh, I know,” lie said sulkily, for ho was in
deadly earnest and perfectly conscious of tho
ludiorousness of his climax, “ I know that I’m
not romantic, and can’t quote Tennyson, and
.Shelley, and all that sort of stuff, but, Waratah.
whatever I may riot Jbe I am a man, and I love you
with all the strength of heart and soul that God
has given me.”
There was a ring such as Waratah had never
heard before in his voice, as he made this declara-
tion. Surely this could not be the same being-
that, boy and man, had been her slave—her
humble worshipper—for years ? ”
She gazed at him curiously for a moment. He
certainly had all the appearance of a man, and a
handsome one, too. He was tall and strong and
glowing with the health that comes from constant
muscular exercise. Indeed there might have been
a suggestion of the merely splendid animal in his
magnificent physique if it had not been for his
large blue eyes, soft and earnest as her own, and
almost as feminine.
“I must go in now, Tom,” she said gravely,
holding out her hand —“good-bye.”
“ Good bye, Warry,” he responded with a return
of his old humility.
She walked a few yards up the path that led to
the house, and then looked back over her shoulder.
Her lover was still standing where she had left
him.
“Tom ! ” she exclaimed softly.
Ho was at her side ill a moment.
“ We have a family ghost, too,” she said, “what
a pity there isn’t a ghost in your family !”
“ If there were would you marry me ? ”
“I might.”
“Right away?”
“Papa would have something to say about that;
I think. But you must first produce you! family
ghost.” She Smiled with her lips as she said this,
but her eyes retained their usual earnest expres-
sion.
After this interview Tom \Vent at Once in search
of Dick Loder, and poured the story of his troubles
into the ear of that faithful friend.
“So Miss Bbrygges vVill not bestow her fair
hand upon you unless a Gaffney family ghost is
forthcoming? ” observed the latter when Tom had
concluded his tale of woe.
“It looks like it,’’Tom replied, “whatdb you
think, Dick ? ”
“I think she won’t,” observed that candid
young man, coolly lighting a cigarette.
“Then what am Itodo ?” said Tom, desperately;
“ there’s a d d haw-haw English swell, who
can’t pronounce his own name, staying at the
Bbryggeses, and I know the old man prefers him
to me. Can’t you think of some way of getting
me out of this scrape, Dick ? ”
“ Haven’t I always got you out of your scrapes
since you were first put into trousers ? ” remarked
the latter, regarding Tom with a glance of mingled
compassion and humour.
Tom nodded affirmatively, and admiringly.
Dick had spoken nothing more than the truth.
But he had omitted to say that the majority of
these scrapes were of his own making.
“ Well, now,” he exclaimed, “as the want of a
ghost is the chief obstacle in the way of your
marrying Miss Bbrygges, the first thing to do is
to procure a ghost. That's clear enough, I hope,”
“ But how in thunder ”
“J’m talking, please. We don’t want any
common, jack-in-the-box spectres that can do
nothing better than pop up in dark corners and
frighten servant girls. We want a dignified and
time-honoured apparition that will do credit to
the ancient House of Gaffney. What do you say
to a Banshee? A Banshee is a deuced sight more
of a swell in the spiritual line than an ordinary
ghost.”
“I’m not sure that I know what a Ban-
shee is, though I’ve heard my father speak of
such a being. But, of course, there are no such
things as ghosts or Banshees in these days.”
“Don’t be too sure ! There are more things in
Heaven and earth—but I need not finish the
quotation as you have no, philosophy of any sort.
A Banshee is the spirit of a female—usually an
ancestress of the family to which she is attached,
and, as a rule, one who has met with a tragic fate.
Her favourite apparel is a red cloak, and she wails
around, the house when members of the family are
about to die, or experience some great sorrow.
None but the very oldest families —meaning, of
course, Irish families —are attended by a spirit of
this description. We haven’t one ourselves
though we are Irish, but I suppose the reason is
that we are not sufficiently Irish —not Milesians,
in fact, like the Gaffneys. I know, however, for
certain, that the family of Larry Hoolahan, our
coach,tnan, has one, because he told me so himself.
We might ask him, to lend you his Banshee for a
while, if the lady herself has no objection.”
“All right, Dick,” said/lom, “I am in your
hands now.”
“ Is it a Banshee?” said Larry, when they found
him. “Troth thin, the Hoolahans have had a
banshee time out of mind, and, I make no doubt,
cud have had a dozen o’ thim for the askin’ in the
grand oujd times whin they wor Kings of Killaloo
and all the counthry around for miles,”
“ Tom, you’d better walk down the garden and
have a smoke while I settle this little matter with
Larry,” remarked Dick, who knew that when
the scion of the Royal House of Hoolahan got
upon the topic of the ancient glories of his family
he would never stop as long as he had a sym-
pathetic listener. Dick, he knew by experience,
was not a sympathetic listener, and so, when Tom
had passed out of earshot, he gave his attention,
to what the former had to say. The conversation
did not last long, and, when it was finished, Dick
strolled down the garden, and told Tom, that the
matter was settled, and that, the Gaffneys would
have a banshee of their own before the setting of
another sun.
“ But how is it going to be managed ?” enquired
Tom.
“Never you mind,” replied his,guide, philoso-
pher and friend, “ Larry has, the secret of how to
recall these old, aboriginal Irish spirits to.their
duty. Ah you have to do in the rhatter is to lie
low and not appear surprised at anything that
may happen.” Tom promised to obey these
instructions to the letter and they parted—Tom
with a hopeful light in his eye, and Dick smiling
like a man who enjoys his own thoughts.
Chap. X.— The Banshee.
Waratah was walking alone, “ between the
gloaming and the mirk,” in the myrtle avenue,
some evenings later. She whs thinking of many
things, but chiefly of Tom. Her heart reproached
her for the manner in which she had treated him
at their last interview. After all, though he
Was not a hero 6f romance,* and coulfl not lay
claim to 1 an ancestral apparition,' she loved him
very dearly.' Then there carhe into her mind the
saying she'had often heard offered as' an exciise
for early marriage—“ What is enough for one is
enough for two.” If this were true in other
respects, why shouldn’t it be true with regard to
a family ghost? She was suddenly roused from
these thoughts by a sound of sweet, strahge sing-'
ing, which appeared to come from the other side
of the wall that ran between her father’s grounds
and the grounds of Gaffneyden—so cfdled by old'
Pat Gaffney as a sarcastic set-off to Bbrygges
Towers. She listened intently. The voice was
the voice of a female, but had something weird
and unearthly in it—or, at least, she imagined so.
The air was unknovVn to hhr, and shfe thought she
had never heard anything so wild and melan-
choly. After a time she fancied khe cOuld make
out words something like the following:—' : " ”
“Oil, Ireland, why did
I lave you, dear,
And be misguided
To come out here,
Where for a sperrit
There’s no career?
Ochone ! Ullaiu !”
“That’s an Irish banshee, I do believe,” said
Waratah to herself in a solemn whisper. “ How-
ever did she get out to Australia?” The song
continued
“ My nature’s cheery;
My heart is glad;
And I am weary
Of being sad ;
The life I’m living
Will dhrive me mad.
Ochone! Ullaiu I
“ If I’d a lover,
HovV fond I’d bo !
His lips I’d cover
With kisses free,
And ire would call me
Ills own Banshee !
Ochone ! Ullaiu !"
The Voice of the singer sank lower and became
inexpressibly mournful in the stanzas that fol-
lowed
" But night-winds soughing
Through graveyard trees;
And storm-winds ploughing
-The wild salt seas,
These are thy lovers;
And only these
Ochone! Ullaiu!
*' My brain wid rhymes of
The ould days rings;
The grand ould times of
The Gaffney kings;
’Twas then 1 lived in
The thick of things—
Ochone ! Ullaiu I”
Waratah’s heart beat fast. This was, without
doubt, the ancestral Banshee of the House of
Gaffney. What a triumph for Tom !
The voice died away in the distance, and
Waratah fancied she saw a cloaked phantom flit-
ing through the trees, A feeling of not unpleasant
awe stole over her, and she shivered and smiled
simultaneously as she walked slowly back to the
house.
But Waratah was not the only person who
heard the song of the Banshee. As the first
strains floated upward through the summer dusk,
a head was thrust through a casement in the
west turret of Bbrygges Towers, and, before the
song had ended, a figure in armour descended the
secret staircase, and crept cautiously into the
garden. There was a step-ladder lying at the end
of the myrtle avenue. The figure seized it, and,
placing it against the dividing wall, climbed up
the steps and looked over. The Banshee was
still singing—
“ O Ireland, jewel
Of earth and sea !
The Fates are cruel
That exile me
From thy green valleys,
Asthorc Machree!
Ochone ! Ullaiu !■
She passed along the path that ran by the wall
on the Gaffneyden side, and the figure in armour
coughed. She looked up quickly and saw a
helmeted head staring at her from the top of the
wall. Even a Banshee has nerves, and can be
startled if a surprise is sprung upon her too
suddenly. So she screamed, and, tucking up her
cloak, prepared to run. But the head spoke
reasoningly, and, in a few moments, the super-
natural couple were engaged in conversation.
“Where did you get to this evening ? I couldn’t
find you anywhere,” said the Hon. Cholmondeley
to his brother an hour or two later,
“ Went down into the garden for a breath of
air,” with a conspicuously unsuccessful attempt
at nonchalance. The Hon. Cholmondeley smiled
quietly, but said nothing at the time. But before
the Hon. Pontefract retired to his lumber-room
for the night he said to him ; “ I shall want you
to lend me that suit of yours, Pum, for an hour or
so to-morrow evening. You don’t mind, I sup-
pose ? ” Pontefract said that he didn’t mind, but
said it with a very bad grace indeed. His brother
affected not to notice this, and from that time
forth donned the armour every other evening.
One night,, about a fortnight after her first appear-
ance, the two brothers were talking in the Hon.
Cholmondeley’s room. The conversation turned
on the Banshee.
“ She has a lovely contralto voice,” said Ponte-
fract with, enthusiasm,
“ Soprano, you mean, ” observed Cholmondeley.
“No, I mean contralto,” said the other
doggedly. “ I suppose I can trust my ears.”
“ You might trust them to help you along if
you wanted to run, before the wind,” remarked
Cholmondeley, in, a sarcastic tone, “ but as far as
helping you to a knowledge of music is concerned,
they might as well be dogs’-ears in a dictionary. ”
It was evident that the : brothers had grown very
jealous of each other sinpe the Banshee had begun,
to appear.
Chap. Xl.— The End op the Bbryggbs-
Gaffney Feud,
It was Christmas Eve, The hot, fierce day had,
died in the west, and the moon, looking like the
purified soul of the sun, soared in the deep blue
heaven and shed her hallowed, light, upon the
earth, beneath, A, little br.eeze, gentle as the
breath of a dreaming infant, stirred the air„ and,
sent tiny wafts of perfume from the garden below
through the open French windows of the drawing-
room of Bbrygges Towers. In the drawing-room
itself a small and select party was assembled to
witness (of all unlikely things in their little world),
the betrothal of Thomas C'olumbkille Gaffney, and
Waratah Rosamond Bbrygges—their full names'
were, of course, used, on such a solemn occasion.
The Hon. Cholmondeley was the god out of the
machine that had caused this unexpected thing to
happen. He liad brought his powerful personal
magnetism, backed by his, aristocratic prest-ige, to
bear upon old Bbrygges, and had at length con-
vinced Him that the only way to assure the. Happi-
ness of his daughter was to bestow her, baud,
along witli his blessing, bn the map of her choice,
youiig Tom Gaffney. The goofi-hatuyed English-'
man found it a more difficult task tp get his host,
to'see that he ought to make up his quarrel with
the elder Gaffney, but even this was brought,
about, partly'by argument, partly by ridicule.
The Hon. Cholmondeley gravely informed
Bbrygges that, as far as old families like his own'
Were concerned, feuds had died out with the'
feudal age. This settled the matter and, greatly
to the joy of everybody, Bbrygges wrote a gener-
ous letter to his old mate informing him that he,
Bbrygges, was willing to forgive him and let
bygones be bygones. Old Pat Gaffney was
nowisd offended at the serenely gracious tone of
the letter. On the contrary, he was delighted. It
tickled his sense of humour. And, bo
was very fond of his son and thought highly, of
Waratah.
So it came to pass that on Christmas Eve he was
sitting in an armchair on one side of the fireplace
—which was filled with and Chiist-
mas-busli brought from Narbethong—in the draw-
ing-room of his ancient mate and enemy. Opposite
him sat that gentleman himself in another arm-
chair. They were a curiously contrasted pair.
Bbrygges was bald, stout, and red-faced. Old
Gaffney was spare and wiry,of figure, with a thick
thatch of iron-grey hair on his head, bright,
twinkling eyes, and a brown face, the wrinkles i“
which had all an upward curl, marking him out
as a man who was in the habit of looking mostly
at the droll side of things.
As for young Tom Gaffney, the heto of the
Occasion, he was absolutely foaming at the eyes
with beatitude, as Dick Loder informed him after-
wards. He went out on the balcony at intervals
and shook hands earnestly with the latter and the
Hon. Cholmondeley—of whom he Was no longet
jealous—who were there talking together. Dick
and the young Englishman, though they had only
met a few times previously, had taken a great
liking for each other. This was fortunate as
things turned out subsequently.
“You have not met my sister Amy,
Colquhoun ?” said Dick, casually.
The Hon. Cholmondeley regretted that, so far,
he had not had that pleasure.
“I brought her here to-night—l suppose she’s
somewhere witli Miss Bbrygges. But I’ll have to
leave you now. I have to arrange a little dramatic
sensation, and I think it’s time for me to take the
stage. You stand here by the side-wings and see
how the thing comes off.”
While they had been talking, Mr. Gaffney,
senior, and Mr. Bbrygges had successively taken
the floor and addressed each other, and the
company in general, in nicely-turned, ceremonious
little speeches. The former said that, next to
being the lineal descendant of an Irish king, who
kept hia own distillery, and lived in it most of his
time, nothing could, in hia opinion, compare with
being descended on the mother’s side from Alfred
the Great. He, the speaker, thought that
Waratah was too fine a girl to be wasted on such
an inappreciative young scamp as his son, (Toni
looked proudly at bis father, and then at the
company, as much as to say, “ There’s a wag for
you ! And at his ago, too !”) He envied Tom,
and considered it was very lucky for him that they
were not both of the same age. If they had been,
the son might have found a rival in his father.
A few other remarks in the same pleasantly
facetious strain concluded the address of Mr,
Gaffney, senior, Mr. Bbrygges then rose in his
place and observed that, though he had met
with many agreeable experiences—he might say
triumphs, if he were given to blowing his own
trumpet, which he was not—in the course of a
long and, he hoped, not altogether unpraiseworthy
career, yet he could say sincerely, with his hand
on his heart (suiting the action to the phrase),
that this was the proudest moment of bis life. He
was glad to clasp once more the hand (reaching
over and clasping it) of his old mate in renewed
friendship, and, though, as a genuine John Bull,
he could not acknowledge that he had been in the
wrong with regard to the old dispute, yet, as it
had all happened so long ago, he would say no
more about it, but trusted that by the marriage of
his daughter with the son of his old mate the
union of the two families would be cemented in a
lasting manner, and that he and his friend would,
in their declining days, smoke their pipes together
while they watched the sports of the young
Bbrygges-Gaffneys, who would, without doubt,
in time to come, take their proper place as the
First Family of Toorak.
It was felt by all present that both old gentle-
men had done ample justice to the occasion. “ I
never saw anything half so good on the stage,”
whispered Amy Loder to Waratah. “If they
went broke to-morrow they could get an engage-
ment as heavy comedians from any theatrical
manager who knew his business.” Amy—a brown-
eyed blonde—was a good type of the Australian
girl at her best; full of vivacity, audacity and
good-nature, with a sou peon of slang added as
seasoning.
Dick Loder now thought that the time bad
come for him to take a part in the performance,,
and he stepped forward accordingly and said —
“ Ladies and gentlemen. As a mutual friend of
both families it gives me great pleasure to. be pre-
sent at this friendly re-union. At the same time
I think that, while we give all due credit to the
natural means by which it was brought about, we
should not forget the supernatural machinery.
I will now, with your permission, introduce to
you. two of the leading characters in the charming
drama which is rapidly approaching its denoue-
ment.”
He went out of a side door and returnedl in a
moment bringing with him the Hon. Pontefract
in full war-gear, but with his visor up, and the
red-cloaked figure that had sung ip the Guffueydey
grounds.
“ Ladies and gentlemen;” said Dick pointing
first to one and then the other figure, “ The Ghost
—The Banshee. ”
MR. BRRYGGES.
“ But not my Ghost,” cried Amy Loder.
“ Npt my Banshee,” exclaimed the lion. Choi-
mondeley^stepping into the room.
The two last speakers saw and recognised each
other. Amy blushed and hid her face behind her
fan, in the middle of which was a neatly cut
aperture through which she surveyed the Hon.
Chohnondeiey witli one wicked eye. The gentle-
man in question looked perplexed and embar-
rassed, for, perhaps, the first time in his life.
“What, two Ghosts and two Banshees?” said
old Pat Gaffney, with a chuckle. “This looks
very much like a comedy within a comedy, friend
Dick.”

“ I don’t understand it,” said Dick, “ but if
there’s any hitch it isn’t my fault.”
He evidently did not understand the situation
just then, but he did at a later period.
“ Why, that’s Kitty Hoolahan, your maid,”
whispered Waratah to Amy Loder. “And I’ve
been taking her for the family Banshee of the
Gaffneys ! Oh, it was too bad to deceive me in
that cruel way.”
“Well, dear,” observed Amy, “you can’c say
she’s not as good-looking a ghost as your family
hobgoblin. But don’t be offended, Warry; you
know I’m only speaking in fun.”
“ I’ve heard about that Banshee song that was
sung in my garden,” remarked old Pat Gaffney,
“but I’d like better to hear the song itself.”
Waratah and the Bbrygges ghost looked at
Kitty Hoolahan. The Hon. Cholmondeley looked
at Miss Amy Loder. The latter rose up and
went to the piano. “I think I know it,” she
said, “come, Kitty, and we’ll sing it as a duet.”
They did so very effectively—Kitty’s rich
contralto blending beautifully with the clear
soprano of her mistress.
The Hon. Cholmondeley sauntered across the
room to where his brother was standing.
“ Soprano, as I said,” he murmured.
“Contralto, as I told you,” replied Pontefract.
Then both smiled and shook hands, unseen by
the rest of the company. They were jealous of
each other no longer.
“Who composed that song?” asked Mrs.
Bbrygges.
“ VVords and music by Richard Loder, Enquire,”
replied Amy, glancing mischievously at her
brother.
“ What does all this mean ? ” enquired Waratah
of Amy.
“ It means, my dear,” was the reply, “ that my
clever brother thought to carry out a little comedy
without letting me know anything about it. He
asked Kitty Hoolahan to play th© part of the
Banshee, and, of course, she came and asked me if
she might. I told her to say ‘yes,’and she did.
Then we took night about in playing it. We had
no trouble in doing this, as old Mr. Gaffney was
in the plot, and used to let us into his grounds
himself. Bub Dick knew nothing about my
escapade. I have something more to tell you, but
it will keep till another time.”
“I’m sorry Ghunda Dass isn’t here,” said Mr.
Bbrygges in a reflective tone.
“Are you?” exclaimed Dick Loder, who was
standing near him, “ then, perhaps, we may find
him. I suppose you wish to settle with him about
keeping on the ghost ? ”
“No, you young dog. You can take away
your ghost. He was a good card, but why did
you trump him with a better one?”
“How?”
“ With the Banshee, of course. But never
mind, I begin to think it was all for the best.
Waratah, my dear, you asked me to give you a
Ghost as a Christmas Box. Yonder he stands.
Take him and be happy.”
“ I think somebody else has a claim on him
already,” remarked Amy with a sly glance at
Kitty Hoolahan.
Dick Loder saved his two performers any
further embarrassment by taking a hand of each
and leading them out after making a ceremonious,
managerial bow to the company.
“ I’ll never believe in a Family Ghost again,”
sighed Waratah as they disappeared.
“I thought,” observed Mrs. Bbrygges, in a
musing tone, “that a Banshee was never heard
except when some trouble was about to fall on
oil© of the members of the family to which she
was attached.”
“ Well, isn’t Tom Gaffney about to be married,
poor fellow?” said Amy Loder.
Envoi.
Tom and Waratah were married about six
nlorlths afterwards and sailed to Europe to spend
tlleir honeymoon. With them went the young
Englishman who had done so much towards bring-
itig their love-affair to a successful issue. He was
the Hori. dholmondeley Oolquhoud no longer, but,
id oorisequenoe of the death of his father and elder
brother, Earl of Oloughcholme (pronounced
Glome). With him went the sister of Dick Loder
—Amy Loder no more but Countess of Clough-
oholme. They are all as happy as it is good for
them to be in this sphere of trial. The Hon.
Pontefract came into a considerable sum of money
when his father died, and elected to settle down in
Australia. He became a reformed character
and is in great demand as a Chairman at Total
Abstinence Corrobborees. Kitty Hoolahan that
was, the Hon. Mrs. Pontefract Oolquhoun that is,
is a bright star of the Melbourne social firmament
and one of the few ladies of society who are always
Welcome guests at Government House. What

“Bess o’ the Rivers,”
A Tale of the Riverine.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
“ One —two —-three —-four—five— tally /”
And through the five coils was passed the rope-
sling.
Truck H 72 was being unloaded. It was a box-
truck, and the red seals of the Customs House
clinging in fragments to the parted doors, showed
that its contents were “in bond.” And, there-
fore, the complete variety of tally-clerks were in
attendance.
Her Majesty’s Customs Department in Victoria
was represented ; so was the Customs Department
of that (to Victoria) foreign-state and disguised
enemy, New South Wales; so was the Victorian
Railway Department; so were the for warding’ and
shipping agents; so was “ the boat.” Four clerks
and a mate—these constituted the company of
“ tally-ers ” which supervised the transfer of a
few tons of fencing-wire from the railway-truck
to the barge of the Tooronga.
It is a way we have “ in the colonics ”, of fetter-
ing every branch of industry and department of
social activity with shackles, in order that some
civil servant may be paid to take them off. The
advantages of this system are obvious—to the
owners of property in the capital cities, to the
politicians, and to the civil servants. It is not so
apparent to the men who have to employ bone and
sinew to make the earth yield its riches arid to smile
with harvests, or who are seeking to build homes
and coin fortunes out of their own energies. But
then, this latter class is of no importance com-
pared with the gentlemen who are privileged to
levy toll on their fellows. This has nothing to do
with the story —and yet has everything to do with
it.
mm*
For Archie Black, the Tooronga’s mate,
thought in this way, and being of the elder race
of river men who, having an idea, were accus-
tomed to fling it out in vigorous speech in scorn
of consequence, he took the opportunity of the
stevedore’s “ Spell, O ! ” to declare as much.
“I say,” he said to nobody in particular, but to
the group of tally-clerks in general, “ this wire’s
for M'Farlane, of Nap Nap. I wonder what old
Tommy thinks he’s payin’ for the stuff? ”
“What d’yer mean, Archie ?” asked Banks, of
the Victorian Customs. “Of course he knows
what he’s paying ! Nine pounds a ton, I s’pose,
in Melbourne in bond. Any donkey can add rail
carriage, duty, steamer freight, and agency
charges to that.”
“Jest so, jest so!” said Black. “That’s all
right so far as it goes, but it don’t go far enough.
Those are what you raajr call the straightforward
charges. What I mean is what you can’t call the
straightforward charges. Look at all you Customs
chaps now —half-a-dozen o’ you in Melbourne to
see as nobody carries out o’ bond in his w’est eoat
pocket a ton or two o’ the wire, an’ so diddle Her
Most Gracious out o’ a few quid, an’ then another
half-dozen o’ you at this en’ to pass the coils from
the truck, an’ see Her Most Gracious ain’t robbed
here. Why, all you coves’ screws are to be paid
out o’ Nappy Mac’s pockets, an’ the pockets o’
such like fools.”
“We do our day’s work for our day’s pay,”
growled Banks. “We didn’t make the work.”
“I didn’t say as you did, did I?” pursued
Black. “I don’t blame you. But Ido say as all
this Customs business is all red-tape an’ rot.
The squatters are bled, an’ the selectors are bled,
an’ the boat-owners are bled—all to put gold-lace
an’ frills on you Gov’ment chaps. What
nonsense it is that we can’t carry a few coils of
wire from one side o’ the river to t’other for a
man’s fence, an’ help him to pertect his prop’ty,
but we’ve to pay shipping dues, an’ wharfage, an’
tide-waiters’ fees, an’ transfer fees, an clearin’ fees,
an’ all the rest o’ th’ humbug.”
Black said all this with the perfect good-humour
characteristic of him. He was always amiable
was Archie, except when, once a month, he “used
to get the drink in him.” If, however, his temper
was not ruffled by the warmth of the controversy
he had excited, that of the civil servants was.
The stevedore’s signal for the resumption of
work was allowed to pass unnoticed in the bitter-
ness and heat of the discussion which ensued.
The number and scope of the “charges” of the
several Public Departments concerned with the
Riverine trade were, at this period, a constant
irritant to the legitimate workers, and the men
who profited by them, feeling their position inse-
cure and ever assailed by the adverse opinion of
their paymasters, clung the more tenaciously to
their brief authority and their fees. Archie’s
attack was accordingly resented with virulence,
and the immediate work at hand was neglected for
the time. But the stevedore, to whom time was
money, did not care to submit to loss in order that
the corruption or the uselessness of the Govern-
ment officials might be exposed. He was at the
winch himself, and as the five coils were already
slung waiting for the hoist he “let her go ” with-
out, however, the customary shout of caution.
The dispute distracted him.
As though the steam had gathered a new fierce-
ness during the short “Spell” time, it beat the
valves and roared and rushed through the
cylinders in a spasm of revolt against the cogs and
ratchets that tried to conquer and regulate it.
The stevedore lost, for one fatal instant, his grip
and his nerve, and as the barrel madly revolved
the great bundle of half-rusted iron was
caught up—swung defiantly out of the grasp of
the lumper who sought to guide its course, and
poised for so long as a child might breathe, then
flung itself over the barge that lay beneath the
cranes. With a cracking and creaking that blis-
tered the ears with repellant sound the tense
chains fell through the sheaves of the crane-jib and
hurled the coils to the bottom of the barge-hold.
The craft quivered with the shock from stern-post
to stem, and had it not been that something came
between the coils and the planking and dulled the
impact, the wire would, in all probability, have
started a plank and sank the Tooronga’s barge
where she lay. But the —something—served as an
effective fender.
# # ' #
When the winch was mastered, and, with
slow revolutions, hauled up the chains and rope
again, the sling did not come up slack and empty.
It seemed a brutal way of sending the thing up,
but it was the most expeditious way. From the
river level to the decking of Echuca wharf the
ascent was by narrow and tortuous steps up which
it would have been a gruesome and arduous labour
to have carried a corpse. So the lumpers in the
hold tied the body of Geordie Allen, late steers-
man of the Tooronga’s barge, into the sling and
sent it up. An infinitesimal experience of paralysis
—and then, death.
Between the tallying of five coils and the tally-
ing of ten, and all because of an off-hand remark
in which there was more joke than earnest, a soul
had gone to its account. Of such accidents life
everywhere is copious enough, but on the rivers,
in the early Seventies, it was more than copious—
it was prolific. Next to the indifference of the rich,
Death finds his most successful ally in the thought-
lessness of the poor.
# # #
So, again, thought Archie Black, when,
next day, after the inquest, the river men in port
followed Geordie Allen to the little cemetery on
the hill. And so thinking, he spoke to the
crowd which, not ignoring the time-honoured
fashion of a river-man’s funeral, gathered the
same night in the long-room of the Esplanade
Hotel. “ Boys,” he said, in the pause that
followed the first gulpings of “she-oak” and
“ brown-sherry ” —ruin was still a favourite drink
on the Murray— “ tain’t no manner o’ use blamin’
the boss stev’dore an’ the owners for accidents
like Geordie’s. Geordie’s gone inside because
chaps as ought to ’a been doini their dooty was
chin-waggin’. I’m not goin’ to shirk my whack
o’ the blame. I set the hall a-rollin’, an’, now 1
thinks of it, pretty near ev’ry accident as has hap-
pened in my time is just because some fellow’s
been doin’ the same thing. ’Tain’t the bosses
always. If we chaps as has to do the graftin’
were a little more mindful o’ one another, we
wouldn’t ha,’ to fork out for the widders an’
orphins so often.”
“ ’Ear, ’ear !” in respectful, subdued tones from
several places in the apartment. The Esplanade’s
patrons were not garrulous and noisy to-night.
The shadow of that inscrutable “ Inside ” was over
them. And—which of them would be the next ?
“An’ sol says, boys, I’m chiefly ’sponsible for
the puttin’-away o’' poor Geordie Allen. If I
hadn’t gone for a dig at the civil service coves,
I’m quite sure that Geordie, instead of bein’ a
stiff-’un, would ha’ been here takin’o’his liquor
like a man, an’ ”
“Beg parding fur interruptin’, Mr. Black,”
said, solemnly, a red-gum sawyer. ■ “Wot’s —I
mean as wot was Geordie’s fav’nt’. p’i’sori ? ”
A youngster “ roustabout river-men never
would say “ rouseabout ’’—laughed enquiringly.
It was his first “ relief ” meeting, and the incon-
gruity of the question struck him, but the only
explanation tendered him was a cuff on the ear,
and a “Shut up, younker.”
“Geordie’s poison, boys” answered Mate
Black, “was rum hot!” And, checking himself
in his speech, he prepared for the ceremony which
inaugurated every “ relief” meeting.
“Shillin’ in, boys, an’ winner pays for rum
hots round. Balance starts the fund.”
There was no applause, nor dissent. This was
the expected—the “regular thing.” The shillings
were thrown down—some modestly, others with a
touch of display, like the method of the land-
boomer of a later day as he dropped bis five-pound
note into the collection-plate, still others with an
element of grudgingness about them. Forty-three
shillings—and forty-three rums hot.
While the drinks were being prepared in the
bar, the Mate took up the thread of his address.
“ As I was sayin’, chaps, we ain’t half careful
enough o’ one ’nother. An’ so as to put the brake
on this sort o’ thing, I puts it to you as we should
’stablish a new custom on the rivers. Whenever
one chap is indirectly or directly the cause of
’nother’s goin’ inside, it’s to be understood as he
starts the fund with a month’s screw ”
“I thought as the shillin’ in was to start it,”
exclaimed the “younker,” irrepressible in his
flashy ignorance.
“ That ’twas the old rule. We makes a new
one to-night if you’re agreeable. An’ ”
“ Are you willin’ to begin the custom in this
’ere case of Geordie’s ?” persisted the boy. “You
takes the blame, yer ses. Are yer a-willin’ to
come down now with yer month’s screw?”
“ If that whipper-snapper an’ cheeky sapling
’d held his tongue for ’nother minute, he’d ha’
heard me say that very thing. The coves wot
know me on the rivers, know I ain’t a chap to
ask others to do what I daren’t do myself ”
“ ’Ear ! ’ear !” in deep-chested chorus. The
mate had the reputation he claimed. He did not
order merely—he was wont to do.
“ An’ so, whether you falls in with my ’dea or
not, I shall plank down my screw for this month
into the hands of the cove you selects as treasurer
—twelve-thirteen-four,”
“’Ear! ’ear!” again. And so, barring forty-
four sixpences, the relief-fund for “ Bess o’ the
Rivers” was started, and a new river custom
established.
* » «
The “rums” were brought in, and Pippy
Taylor, the landlord, threw his shilling down also,
for his chance. And then they counted round to
see who should take the pool, pay for the drinks,
and head the list “ , J!1 25.”
Mate Black, presiding, began the call. “ One I”
he said. And so the numbers went round—now
gruffly, now shrilly, now in bass and now in
treble, now grunted, now sung, till 77 was reached.
That was the winning number. A fireman of the
Cumberoona was “77,” and his face was good to
look upon as he gathered in the coins, paid half to
the landlord, and handed the other moiety to the
chairman. Generosity invariably blesses the
giver—especially when he is giving what others
have subscribed.
“‘Fred. Jones —Cumberoona,’ Mr. Black—
twenty-two boh ” —he called.
And his name went down on the list, and
beneath it : “ Archibald Black, Tooronga ”
twelve-thirteen-four.
* m #
Black rose with his steaming glass in his
hand. And those of the throng who had seats
followed his example—till all stood,
“Boys,” Black said, “ here’s luck to the woman
Geordie’s left.” And Geordie’s tipple was drank
to the future of the woman Geordie left. There
was always a woman. And what better com-
pliment to the dead than to drink his favourite
p’ison to his dear one’s luck ?
“Wife or mother?” questioned one, when the
glasses were down again.
It was curious how, after a fatality, relief meet-
ings were frequently convened before any precise
information was to hand as to the position of the
bereaved. And it was as pathetic as curious, for
it proved the existence of a belief that the man
who “ went inside sudden ” generally bequeathed
no other legacy than the distress which is the
more poignant because accentuated with penniless-
ness.
Black answered —“Neither I think—nor sister
—but a sweetheart.”
“ In ’Chuca ?”
“ No, Town. An’ I’ve got his last letters to
her from his bunk—l can’t find any o’ hers, an’
his ain’t finished—but he’d got the envelope
written —an’ I guess as she’s neither mother, nor
sister, nor wife, but his girl.”
“Wot’s her name?’ asked a deckhand of the
Riverina. But the look the “chair” gave him,
aud the sibillant hiss from the crowd, made him
wish he had not spoken. They didn’t mention
women’s names lightly in thejriver-workers’ meet-
ing. They left that to the fine gentlemen of the
Millewa Club who were the elite of the aristocracy
of the Riverine.
“Never mind her name,” said Black. “At
least all of it. Her first name is Elizabeth—poor
Geordie calls her ‘Bess,’ an’ that’s enough for
ev’ryone as ain’t on the committee. It ain’t like
as if she was his own kin —then you could call this
fund straight out ‘ Mrs. Allen’s Fund ’ or ‘ Miss
Allen’s Fund.’ Bub you can’t call this by her
name. You can tell pals here she’s his girl, but
you can’t stick it up, as ’twere, all over the
country.”
“ ’Ear, ’ear ! ” said most. But one exclaimed :
“You must have a name for the fund.”
“ Yes,” responded Archie. “ So I moves as we
call it ‘Bess’s Fund—Bess o’ the Rivers.’ That’s
like takin’ her under our pertection.” And to
these honest souls the words conveyed no double-
entendre.
“ I second the proposishun,” said a burly
engineer from Mackintosh’s mill.
Aud the “ Ayes ! ” had it—deeply and sympa-
thetically, but not quite unanimously.^
Then a sub-committee was appointed, with
Black as chairman and treasurer, and the sub-
scriptions were recorded. From “fivers ’ to
“ five bobs ’’—the latter sum from the “younker,”
who was just “on wages’’—were noted. When
the cash was not forthcoming, orders were drawn
on the boat-skippers, or mill-foremen. And at
monthly pay they would be duly honoured.
All subscribed but three or four. And they, not
because they did not regret Allen’s death or were
unsympathetic, but from another reason, declined ;
“They didn’t see why they should furnish the
house for another chap,” said one, aud he spoke
for the other dissentients. The reason had some
force, and for some minutes the proceedings were
stayed. At last —
“ The committee have decided to read Geordie’s
unfinished letter,” said Archie. “They’re going
to take the sense o’ the meetin’ as to whether the
girl to whom Geordie —as clear-headed and good-
hearted chap as ever breathed—writes like this
can’t be trusted to do what’s right with money
given to her because we liked him. An,’ them as
don’t think so needn’t subscribe. An’ now, I’U
read the letter. The chap what interrupts or
laughs will be chucked out. There, that’s
straight!” The caution was needless. There was
no desire to laugh—the “ younker,” even with his
youthful lack of sentimentality, looked and felt
interested.
* m *
“Dearest Bessie,” the letter began—the
reading was halting—
“ I hope this will find you well, as it leaves me at pre-
sent. I have asked the skipper to tell the agents’ Mel-
bourne office to give you my pay this month—l don’t
want none, and, dear Bessie, 1 know as it’s better with
you than me, for you know, dear Bessie, I would go on
the tear a bit if I had the cash. You say I am not to
come down soon so as to save all the more for our mar-
riage .”
Black paused. More than one brown and blistered
hand fumbled with pipes here. The blessed things
wouldn’t draw !
The reader went on :
“ I thought as you was a bit hard at first, but now I’ve
considered it over, you are right as you always are, dear
Bessie. I know you wants to see me as bad as I wants to
see you, and it’s a .”
“ There’s a blot here,” said Black. “He forgot
he was writin’ to his girl.”
“ It’s a good thing as your pretty little head is screwed
on right .”
From among the intent and breathless audience
the fireman of a timber craft jumped to his feet.
“Look here, chaps,” he said, a generous
passion conquering his reluctance to speak, “ we’vo
heard enough !”
“ ’Ear ’ear !” From most,
“None of us would like the words we write to
our girls to be seen, would we ?”
“No —no !”
“ Then stash the readin’, I say. The girl’s all
right. And we’re poor, God-damned sort of
creatures if we can’t trust the girl to make good
use of what Geordie’s left her. For that’s jest
what ’tis, chaps. Tis really Geordie’s legacy to
her—what we gave him for old-times’ sake.”
Again the resonant “ Hear, hear!” shook the
room. Mate Black refolded the blotted, ill-
scrawled sheet of paper, with a calm, judicial;
“ I knew you’d say that, boys !”
And then the dissentients fell in with the views
of the majority. What with cash and “ orders,”
the subscription was sixty pounds odd. That
meant, by the time the boats then running trips,
and the river-township’s “pubs.,’’and the Customs-
houses had been canvassed, a full hundred pounds.
The girl might want it, or she might not —they
really could not say. But, as Black remarked,
“The chances are she does. Bargemen’s girls
don’t roll in wealth. An’, besides, it was a
damned good opportunity for ’stablishin’ a custom
o’ maltin’ us pay for one ’nother’s deaths, when
Tis our fault.”
# * #
And the girl—for whom these rough fellows
were so solicitous? Was she worth the rude
chivalry of their protection ?
The morning after the meeting, Archie had to
sail for Hay. But the machinery of charity
organisation was ever ready on the rivers. The
much-derided civd service fellows knew bow to
get the lists out, and how to get them in again.
Charity was red-hot among the boating interests,
for, to tell the whole truth, the river-men were
huge drinkers, and the pub-keepers who cashed
pay-orders in advance had a nasty habit of getting
them lodged at the agents’ offices in readiness for
pay-day. When a boathand was “on the tear,”
he was apt to forget both his friend’s woes and the
orders he had given to alleviate them, And so
the civil servants who were supposed to attend to
the clerical work of the subscription-funds—and a
lot of work it entailed one way and another—used
to circulate the lists quickly, and get them in as
speedily. By the time Archie came back from
Hay, there was the hundred pounds and a few
pounds over.
As the Tooronga’s skipper entered at the Vic-
torian Customs, Banks said to him; “There’s
that money for Bess o’ the Rivers —Geordie Allen’s
girl. Can you let Archie run to town about it ?
Francis, the stationmaster, has promised a free
pass if you will.”
The skipper promised, and Archie Black
travelled, at the Government expense, “ to fix up
the fund.” He took with him a Bank of Victoria
draft.
# # #
In four days he was back. And the draft
was uncashed in his pocket-book.
He had gone to the address given on Geordie
Allen’s envelope, and had found it a stnall shop in
Lonsdale-street.
“Can I see Miss Russell?” he asked timor-
ously of the sodden-featured drab behind the
counter. The mate had tackled a crowd of
drunken deck-hands fearlessly, but he became a
coward, he felt, in approaching the bereaved
woman who was dead Geordie’s love.
“ Russell —Miss Russell? I don’t know no girl
of that name! ” grumbled the drab, who had
anticipated a customer.
“No! Not Miss Bessie Miss Elizabeth
Russell ? ”
A sudden gleam of interest flashed into tiie
filmy eyes of the shopkeeper. She stood and
faced him.
“ Where’r you from ?” she asked.
“ Echuca !”
“ Oh, oh— you’re Sal’s chap, are yer? You’re
her chap, Alien —I tol,d her I’d give her away !
Look here, you fool •”
Black raised his hand. “No,” he said, “I’m
not Allen—he’s dead. I’m a friend of his !”
“Dead!” was the brutal rejoinder. “An’ a
d d good job for him, too! He’d ha’ been
dead soon enough had Sal married him. What a
fool he must ha’ been to ha’ been taken in
by her !”
“ Where is she? Isn’t her name Bessie Russell?”
“ Bessie Russell—my eye, an’ Betty Martin !
I know’d he wrote her under that name to here,
hut she an’ me ’s fallen out, an’ I won’t ha’ no
more to do with her. She’s Sal Gordon —the
worst girl on Melbourne streets.”
“ Where is she ?”
“ You’ll find her in Romeo Lane —an’ —look
’ere!”
“ Well.”
“ Take a hobby wi’ yer, if yer goin’ there !”
st # *
In a small, low room, that was furnished
with scarce aught else than the memories of a
thousand lecheries, he found Geordie Allen’s love.
The Bess o’ the Rivers fund was merged into
the next local charity subscription.


BUNTHORP'S DECEASE
BY
LRNEST
FAVENC
Tk s y
poetry, does ho ? ”
“Yes, and worse.” ■'
“ Worse ? Impossible ! *
“Tries to set it to music, and accompanies him-
self on the concertina.”
“ Great heavens ! I must see about it. Deane
was a real good fellow, and I can’t let his son go
to the dogs without an attempt to save him. Tell
Billy to run up Rocket and Revolver from the big
paddock first thing in the morning.”
So spake old Bunthorp, of Wattlemere Station,
as he and his nephew yarned on the verandah one
evening, after the return of the latter from attend-
ing a general muster at Branksia Downs, some 40
miles distant.
Bunthorp shortly retired to bed, and Jim
Newton strolled over to “the quarters” to play
euchre for tobacco, any higher stakes being strictly
forbidden on Wattlemere.
Next morning saw the old man seated in a buck-
board buggy behind Rocket and Revolver, trotting
sedately along the road, winding through alternate
belts of scrub and plain, that separated the two
stations.
“ Awful thing,’ he thought, as he sipped the
mid-day quart of tea at “ the yellow waterhole,”
rather more than half-way. “Fancy Deane’s boy
taking to scribbling poetry. Why the cattle will
go to the deuce in no time. I don’t believe Deane
ever wrote anything but a horse-receipt or his
name to a cheque.” Musing thus on his dead
friend the old gentleman dropped off into a
pleasant doze under a sheltering brigalow tree,
while Rocket and Revolver, carefully hobbled out,
stood nose to tail in an adjacent patch of scrub,
sleepily whisking the flies off each other.
“ I say, guv’nor 1 ’
Old Bunthorp opened his eyes and looked
sternly at the disturber of his forty winks. A swag-
man, with “genus sundowner” written all over
him, had oast his rolled blanket on the ground and
was busy putting together the smouldering sticks
that had boiled Bunthorp’s quart-pot.
“ S’pose you’ll give a fellow a feed ? ” he re-
marked.
Bunthorp nodded majestically, as if to impress
the man with the idea that he had only closed his
eyes for a few minutes in order to meditate better
over the advantage of, only a first cross of Here-
fords; but the new-comer, quite unimpressed,
strolled down to the water to fill the small “billy ”
he was carrying. When he returned, Bunthorp
was just starting off with the winkers in his hand
to catch his horses ; he indicated the remainder of
the bread and beef to the man, who acknowledged
the favour with an easy nod as he piled the blazing
sticks around his billy to facilitate a speedy boil.
When the old gentleman returned with the nags
the stranger enquired for the tea and sugar with
the cool familiarity of an acquaintance. “ Not a
bad sort of a prad that brown one,” he remarked ;
“ looks a little gone in the near fore-leg.”
Bunthorp was speechless. Rocket, the prad in
question, was rising five and as sound as a bell.
He slipped on the collars whilst the swagman
made and sweetened his tea. Then he busied
himself putting the contents of the buggy straight.
Meantime his uninvited guest attacked the bread
and beef.
“How far to Branksia Downs?” he said, as
Bunthorp was preparing to start.
“ About fifteen miles.”
“ You wouldn’t give a fellow a lift, would you ?
I’m dog-tired.”
Now, Bunthorp was the best-natured of men,
and, moreover, was never slow in boasting how he
had risen from the ranks himself; but the idea of
driving up to Branksia Downs homestead with
this disreputable-looking dead-beat beside him,
was rather a staggerer. He hesitated.
“ Come, guv’nor, if you knew how just about
done up I am, you wouldn’t think twice. What’s
my weight to two such bits of stuff as those ?”
“Well, look sharp and finish your grub,” said
the old fellow, “ I won’t wait long.”
The seedy stranger made but a lew bites of the
remainder, swallowed his tea scalding-hot without
winking, and in a few minutes took his seat with
the greatest coolness beside James Bunthorp,
Esq., of Wattlemere.
Rocket and Revolver soon cqvered the fifteen
miles, the swagman beguiling the way with a little
general advice on pastoral matters, hints as to
breeding, &c., winding up by urging his disgusted
companion to always drive with a cross-bar on the
pole, in future. In fact, when they arrived at the
paddock-gate, half-a-mile from the station, Bun-
thorp could scarcely determine whether he had
given the stranger a lift, or the stranger had given
him one. At the gate he saw his opportunity. The
man got down to open it. “Iwill send your swag
to the men’s hut,” said Bunthorp, as whipping up
his horses he drove on, leaving the discomfited
wayfarer to close the gate and follow on foot.
“Well, Fred, my boy,” said the old man, as a
young fellow came out to greet him. “ Heard
such terrible accounts of you from Jim that I had
to come over myself and see about it.”
“What has Jim been saying?” returned the
other, as he shook him heartily by the hand.
“But come inside first; George will see to the
buggy and horses. Glory ! what sort of a swag is
that you’ve got on board ?”
“O ! 1 gave a fellow a lift on the road. There
he is, coming up the paddock now. Give him his
swag, George, when he comes up,” he continued
to the groom, and then both men went inside the
house.
“Have you got any of the old whisky left,
Fred, or was it all swamped this muster?”
“Not quite !” returned the other ; “ rather too
good for the general public, who only want some-
thing that bites as it goes down. No fear, here
we are.”
“His heart is in the right place,” murmured
old Bunthorp as ho put the amber-coloured fluid
!to his lips. “Your father
and I bought this whisky in
bond six years ago,” he con*
tinued aloud. “Unfortu-
nately my share is gone,
but —here’s to his memory.
Now, Fred, 1 must speak
seriously.”
“Suppose we wait until after dinner,
it will be ready at six. 1 just want
to run down to the yard for a minute;
meantime you know your old room.
Go and rinse some of the dust off.”
“Seems nothing wrong with him—wonder if
Jim has been taking a rise out of me !” thought
the old man, as he turned into the bedroom he
generally occupied. “My word !”
There had been some changes in the interior
arrangements of Branksia since his last visit, and
young Deane had forgotten that he had trans-
ferred his own belongings to the former guest-
chamber, consequently, when Bunthorp turned
into what he thought was his room, he found him-
self in Fred’s. But this had not occasioned the
exclamation. Fred’s room in its simple bareness
was quite familiar to him. There was the collec-
tion of whips, the row of boots, from a dandified
pair of tops that he once rode a steeplechase in to
the reach-me-down bluchers that he wore in the
drafting-yard, a few native weapons, a picture of
Carbine, and the necessary furniture, that was all
as it should be ; but there was something fresh—a
new picture on the wall: a photograph got up and
finished in the style these things are done nowa-
days. The likeness of an exceedingly pretty girl.
Bunthorp picked up his valise again and beat a
retreat, chuckling. “The young dog, won’t I
roast him !” And it was only after three or four
immersions in cold water that he managed to wash
the sly look out of his jolly face.
Meantime Deane was astonished to find no one
at the yard. There were a few head of cattle to
be drafted, some outsiders, missed during the
muster, and he wished to draft them overnight, so
that the calves could be branded at daylight in
the morning. A sustained yell brought two or
three men out of the hut.
“Nearly forgot all about the cattle, Mr.
Deane,” said one, as he swung himself over the
cap. “Blessed if we were not all laughing so at
that cure of a fellow Mr. Bunthorp gave a lift to.”
“ Regular bush lawyer,” said another.
“Then he won’t get a job from me,” replied
Deane, as he picked up the drafting-pole and
opened the gate.
“Job!” said the man who had first spoken,
“ he don’t want no job—lives upon blow.”
“ Rocket and Revolver stood nose to tail in an adjacent patch of scrub, sleepily whisking
the flies off each other.”
At dinner Bunthorp was brimming over with
facetiousness. Mysterious allusions to a coming
volume of poetry, to the expense of re-furnishing
the house and building “a weaning paddock”
(nursery), to breaking in side-saddle horses, and
various other old jokes, at which he laughed so
much himself that Fred had to join him.
“Now, when is it to be!” he said when they
were seated in the verandah doing the regulation-
pipe.
Fred felt glad it was comparatively dark, for
the old man’s fun was rather merciless.
“I suppose,” he said, “that beggar Jim has
been telling tales about me. ”
“ He said you had taken to writing poetry, to
spouting it, and singing it to a concertina.”
“ Confounded old ass he must be. I only asked
him his opinion on a few lines of verse, and as for
the concertina business—why, we were just trying
to pick out a tune together. But I suppose I may
as well own up—l am engaged.”
“ Who is she, Fred ?”
“Come in to the light,” returned Deane; and
going to his room he returned with the portrait
Bunthorp had seen hanging on the wall. “Do
you know her?” he asked, as Bunthorp regarded
it admiringly and curiously.
“1 seem to recognise the face,” said the old
gentleman; “seems as familar as possible now
and again, and then it’s all different.”
“ You have not seen her for five years, and she
was only 13 then .”
“Not Maggie Barlow?” cried Bunthorp, with
the fun gone clean out of his face and voice.
“ Certainly it is. Why, she used to be your
greatest pet at one time,”
“ Ah, that was before Deane found Barlow out.
I admit I did like her immensely, as a child, but
you can’t alter a bad breed, no matter how good-
looking the calf is ; it will come out by-and-bye.”
Fred coloured, although he also felt inclined to
laugh. “Of course, I stand you saying things I
would not let anybody else utter, but you’re very
unjust, to say the least of it.”
“Unjust! Why? Was I not acquainted with the
whole of the circumstances ? Did not your father
confide everything to me, and, by my advice, did
not prosecute him ? Only for me, Fred, Barlow
would now be in prison. Your father was not a
merciful man, you know, although nobody could
be juster.”
“ I know the man yielded to a great temptation,
and he has bitterly repented it ever since,”
returned Deane; “but I believe, and I think you
do, that it was done to save his son.”
“That’s another pretty thing,” cried the old
gentleman, who was now excitedly walking up
and down the room. “You mark my words ;so
soon as ever you are married, that precious scamp
will turn up and sponge on you.”
“I think you know me better than that. Am I
such a weak-minded individual ?”
“ No, Fred, you’ve got plenty of backbone, but
he’ll try it on. He’ll hear of it, even if he’s in
Pentridge or Darlinghurst.”
“I think he must be dead. Maggie has not
heard his name mentioned for years. But we
won’t talk any more to-night. Sleep on it, and I
know you’ll give me your best wishes in the
morning.”
Half-an-hour afterwards Deane was alone,
strolling about in front of the verandah, smoking
and thinking of the late conversation. The night
was dead calm, and the voices from the men’s
quarters sounded clear and distinct; one in par-
ticular, which he could not recognise, seemed to
monopolise the conversation.
“The bush lawyer, I suppose,” thought Fred,
and by way of amusement he sauntered within
hearing. The men were lounging about in the
broad verandah of the kitchen, and the traveller
was holding forth.
“Bunthorp ! Who’s Bunthorp?”he was saying;
“ why, you coves seem to think that he’s the Hem-
peror of China. Now, I’ll bet you a fiver all
round ” —here there was a burst of laughter—
“ What are you laughing at?” demanded the
unabashed swagman.
“Produce your fivers, old man,” said one of his
audience.
“Well, I ain’t got ’em about me just now,”
returned the shabby stranger, “ but I would bet
you if I had ’em that you give old Bunthorp a
French book to read and he won’t understand a
word of it, and give it to me and I’ll translate it
straight off the reel. Yet he drives his buggy and
I have to walk.”
“Except when he gives you a lift,” said the
cook.
“ Hang his lift,” returned the other. “ Mighty
generous thing to do with a couple of fat, strong
horses in the traces. ”
“ I don’t know whether he understands French
or not,” said the stockman, “ and I don’t care, but
he’s a decent old boy, and I wish there were a few
more of his sort knocking about the district.”
“ Decent old boy !” sneered the swagman.
“Who couldn’t be decent with a good-paying
station and a fat balance in the bank ?”
“Plenty of ’em,” said the cook, “ I know lots
far richer than Bunthorp who are as mean as you
make ’em.”
“ Just so, ” returned the traveller, “and the
worst of it is, it’s catching. Now, if old Bunthorp
came to you and said ‘Bill, I’m short of change ;
lend me a note,’ you’d say, ‘certainly, Mr, Bun-
thorp, take two,’ now, wouldn’t you?”
“Of course I would, if I had it.”
“ Of course you would, and if I came to you and
said ‘ Bill, I’m stone broke ; lend me a note till I
get a job,’ what would you say ?”
There was an ominous silence ; then the stock-
man reared up his long, lean form, and, knocking
the ashes out of his pipe, remarked : “ I’m going
to camp ; we’ve got to be up the first thing to
brand those calves, boys.”
There was a general dispersal, and the disgusted
swagman was left with his question unanswered.
“I wonder,” thought Deane, as he made his
way to bed, “ how it is that that fellow’s voice is
so familiar to mb ? Bad egg, I suppose, who speaks
like a gentleman by accident now and again.”
11.
Barlow had been Crown Lands Commissioner in
the neighbouring township five years before. He
was a widower, with one girl, but people who
knew everything said that the Barlow who got
three years for embezzlement from one of the
banks was his son. It was a much-talked-of case,
from the despicable efforts made by the culprit,
who was bank-teller, to put the guilt on to an inno-
cent man. Deane and Bunthorp knew the truth
for they had been fast friends of the commissioner
until the fatal day when a broken, miserable man
rode to Branksia Downs and confessed to the
owner that he had used his name criminally to
obtain money ; and gave him back the price of
his shame. Bunthorp, who was there, believed
that it was a mad attempt, made too late, to save
his son from disgrace, and begged his old friend,
whose nature was less placable, to take the
money and spare the unfortunate father. Deane
did so, Barlow applied for a change, and his name
was never willingly mentioned by the two who
had been his friends. All these things came into
Bunthorp’s mind before he fell asleep ; and as the
old man knew, too, that black sheep were to be
found in nearly every flock, he gradually came
round to the opinion that possibly a young fellow
like Deane, with his head screwed on right, could
not come to much grief by marrying a girl like
, Maggie, whose only fault was a disgraced brother,
i and a father prematurely broken down by that
son’s disgrace. Before Bunthorp fell asleep, he
had in spirit bestowed a fatherly blessing on the
young people.
Fate seemed determined that his slumbers
should not be as calm as his conscience merited.
Somebody touched him; somebody whispered,
1 “Mr. Deane!”
Bunthorp was not nervous, he had gone through
too many rough episodes. “Who is there?” he
asked in an equally low tone.
“Bell! Sergeant Bell! We are after some-
body, and I think he’s here. I don’t want to
disturb the place or he might give us the slip.
Any strangers here to-night ?”
“I’m Bunthorp. Fred has changed his room.
There was a traveller on the road. I gave him a
lift. He’s here to-night, I suppose.”
“ Where did you pick him up?” said the
sergeant, still in a whisper.
“ At the yellow water hole.”
“Yes, that’s where we lost his tracks, we
guessed you might have picked him up so we
came straight on here. I suppose he’s in the
men’s hut. But I’m glad I saw you first ” —this
was allegorical, for it was pitch-dark—“can you
come outside for a minute ?” Bunthorp noiselessly
slipped on some clothes and, barefooted, followed
the policeman, who had also left his boots outside.
Out of hearing of the house they put on their foot-
gear and went a short distance to where a black
tracker stood holding three horses.
“I should like to get this fellow away quietly
without troubling Mr. Deane,” said the sergeant,
“now that I have the chance; for I’ll tell you
who he is. That son of old Barlow’s who served
his time for the bank swindle.”
Bunthorp whistled. “What has he been up
to ?”
“Valueless cheques for one thing, and doctoring
a cheque for another, turned seven into seventy ;
very neatly too, I understand. He got a warning
from somebody and gave the Brisbane police the
slip; he’s splendidly got up as a hard-up loafer,
and has got all the patter off like a professional
hand, no one suspected him but a girl at the
Royal, in ——, who knew him in his bank days.
She gave him away. Of course, you know, Deane
is sweet on the sister, so I should like to take him
quietly for both their sakes.”
“Very thoughtful of you, Bell, I am sure
said Bunthorp; “ how can we manage it ?”
“We can’t take him now without waking the
place, and if we wait till daylight he might give
us the slip—he’s so artful,’ returned Bell.
“Deane will be down at the yard for an hour or
two after daylight, there are a few calves to
brand. Could you manage it then?’’
“I think so, it’s not more than two hours off
daylight now. We’ll turn our horses out behind
that patch of scrub, and be up there at crow-chirp
and catch my gentleman in his blankets as soon
as the others go down to the yard. There’s an old
hut alongside the kitchen we can plant in.”
“I’ll slip in and get you a bit of grub, our
supper is still on the table,” said the hospitable
Mr. Bunthorp, and like a substantial phantom he
disappeared in the darkness, and presently
returned with some provender and a drop of the
incomparable whisky, which he had smuggled
out without wakening Deane, the only other
occupant of the house. Bunthorp had no desire
toyeturn to bed, but shared the sergeant’s watch
until the first streak of light in the eastern horizon
warned them to be on the alert. Quietly they
stationed themselves in the old hut, whence,
through the chinks between the slabs, they could
see what went on.
It was done without any trouble at all. Deane
and his men were busy at the yard when Bell
stood over the sleeper and requested the pleasure
of his company. Before they started, Bunthorp
got leave to sajf a few words* privately' to the
prisoner.
“ I know who you are,” he said, “ and for your
father’s sake, whom you nearly ruined, I should
like to do something for you. What can I do?
I presume you are guilty of this charge ?”
Barlow looked at him with his manner partly
changed ; and the old man noted with sorrow the
likeness to his sister, which he now saw plainly.
“ I may get out of this,” Was the answer, “ I 1 think
there’s a legal quibble or two in my favour ; if 1
do, may I ask a favour of you ?”
“ Yes, I will do what 1 can. What is it ?”
“ When the time Comes I will ask it,” and he
turned away. Next minute the sergeant and his
prisoner were gone.
When Fred came up to breakfast, he was in
blissful ignorance that his prospective brother-in-
law had just been marched off in handcuffs ; and
there was some laughter amongst the men when
they were told of the swagman’s exit.
Bunthorp naturally scanned the papers with
some degree of interest, until he saw that Barlow’s
favourable anticipation had been only partially
fulfilled. He had managed to wriggle out of the
graver charge, and escaped with twelve months’
imprisonment and a severe lecture from the judge
for one of the minor offences.
Fred Deane was married, and Bunthorp had
beamed on the union. Eighteen months had
flown by, when he received a letter he had been
for some time expecting; it was from young
Barlow, asking for the promised help. The letter
touched the good old man. There was no hypo-
critical pretence of reformation : the writer simply
stated his desire to leave Australia and begin life
anew in another country, mentioning the Cape as
the colony to be honoured with his patronage, and'
asking for a sum of money to enable him to go
there. Needless to say it was at once forwarded ;
and Bunthorp trusted that that page was folded
down for good.
“My dear Fred,” he wrote, some six months
afterwards, “ I have just remembered that the
sth of next month is your wife’s birthday, so I am
coming over the day before to stop the night, and
bring a present to deliver the next morning. Don’t
show this to Maggie, or she may be curious.”
On the evening of the 4th, according to promise,
Bunthorp and Jim Newton drove up to Branksia,
but the most inquisitive glances cast into the
buggy, still drawn by the faithful Rocket and
Revolver, could not discern anything unusual in
its contents. This was not to be wondered at,
for “the present” was but a letter with a Cape of
Good Hope stamp on it, telling of young Barlow’s
bright prospects, and conveying a kind message
to his sister, and an assurance that the future
would atone for the past. The old man had a
small gift as well, but this was the surprise he had
planned. That night he slept in the room made
memorable by the visit of Sergeant Bell, and it
was with a decidedly nervous start that he
found his slumbers once more disturbed. Some-
body was moving about the room, apparently
examining the contents of the dressing-table.
Bunthorp sprang out of bed as fast as a
stout, old gentleman, who had been sleeping on
his back, could be expected to spring. As
that was not very rapidly, the intruder had gone
before Bunthorp had reached the spot where his
shadowy form had been visible. Bunthorp went
but to the verandah, but an outcry of dogs by the


stables told him that the pursuit was vain ; the
quarry had too good a start. Returning to his
room he struck a match, and, having lit a candle,
proceeded to investigate. Apparently nothing
had been taken, but on the table was a leaf from
a pocket-book, folded and addressed to himself,
“If you want to save your friend Deane some
trouble and distress,” it ran, “take a walk down
the paddock, as far as the gate, before breakfast,
as soon after sunrise as possible.”
“Is this Queensland or one of the disturbed
districts of Ireland?” muttered the old man,
savagely, as he got into bed again. “I’ll take a
walk down the paddock with a good whip in my
hand, and all the dogs with me and in a few
minutes he was sound asleep again. Like all
bushmen he instinctively awoke at daybreak, and,
dressing himself, went out just as the red sun
appeared above the low tree line. He had a heavy
crop in his hand, and a whistle brought at least
half-a-dozen demonstrative dogs of all breeds to
his heels, eager for a morning gambol.
The paddock-gate was out of sight of the home-
stead, being screened by some clumps of scrub ;
leaning against it was a man, who, when he turned
and faced the new-comer, revealed to Bunthorp’s
intense amazement the features of the former
swagman, young Barlow.
He was fairly well-dressed, and a good horse
was fastened to the fence a few panels away.
“So you’ve come back from the Cape?” was
Bunthorp’s exclamation.
“I’ve never been to the Cape, you old fool!”
was the amazing reply. “ That letter was posted
by a friend of mine who went there. No ; I have
got a long score to settle with you before we have
done with each other.”
“You d d thief, you took my money— 1 —”
began Bunthorp, violently.
“Yes,” interrupted the other, “I took your
money under false pretences; and I put it on the
Melbourne Cup, and, by George, I won, and I
intend to get some more out of you, so there.”
“No, I’ll bo boiled down if you will,” said the
“ 'S’pose. you'll give a fellow a feed?' he remarked."
old man. “What score have you to settle with
me ?”
“Didn’t you put that sergeant on to me?
He told me all about it. When you found out
who I was, why didn't you give me warning and
get me away ? You could easily have managed
it. Hang you and your friendship for my father.
Between you all I’ve been shamefully treated, and
I intend to take it out of you.”
During this harangue Bunthorp had been, so to
say, stoking ; he was now at boiling heat and ripe
for an explosion. “ You hang-dog gaol-bird,” he
commenced, “ you been shamefully treated ! why
you have never had your deserts yet. Take it out
of me, you abominable scoundrel? Why don’t
you do it? ” and he fairly danced with rage.
“Keep cool, old boy,” said Barlow, “you’ll
want all you’re breath before you’ve done with
me. To-day is Maggie’s birthday, and lam going
to present myself to wish her many happy returns,
I can assure you some of my prison anecdotes will
quite liven up the conversation, and I really won't
stop away under a high consideration.”
“ You’ll not get a red cent, that I guarantee.
Fred Deane is not such a fool as to be blackmailed
by you; try it, and see what you’ll get,” returned
Bunthorp whose business faculties at once came to
the front.
“ Oh, but that is not all; you and Fred’s father
compounded a felony; you know you did ; that
will be a nice little story to rake up.”
“Whether we broke the law or not I do not
know, but every honest man will be on our side,
and I don’t care a snap of the fingers for the
rest. ”
The two men looked at each other defiantly
across the gate, but the swindler had failed and
he knew it. He turned away jauntily. “Well,”
he said, airily, “ I’ll call round after breakfast, see
you again. So long, old Bun. ”
This was the crowning insult. Flinging open
the gate Bunthorp with upraised whip rushed
at the sneering Barlow while the joyous dogs
surged tumultuously around. The two men
struggled together- and the dogs, wild with
delight, sent up a chorus of yelling, barking, and
snapping that raised some laggard cur at the
station and attracted everybody’s attention.
Barlow’s horse, startled at the uproar, broke his
bridle with an indignant snort and trotted away
in the bush.
“ The dogs have got a kangaroo stuck up at the
back of the scrub,” said one of the men, and two
or three of them came running down.
Bunthorp had got in several stinging cuts
before Barlow seized the whip, and then they
struggled hard for the possession of it, the dogs
making indiscriminate and quite impartial
snaps at the legs of both. The younger man
succeeded in wresting the crop from his opponent,
who was soon winded ; he threw him off and
gave him a blow with the butt as he did
so, unfortunately, on the head. Bunthorp went
down senseless and Barlow started to pursue his
horse, but the pack of dogs had to be first
scattered with the whip. By this time two active
men who had taken a short cut through the scrub
appeared on the scene. They vaulted over the
fence, and as Barton’s horse was now nearly out of
sight, he saw it was useless to Tun, so stood still
to await them.
“The old fellow turned on me with his whip,
and in the struggle I knocked him down,” he
said, when they reached the spot. They bent
over Bunthorp, and one of them gave a
loud eoo-ee that brought others down —amongst
them Deane and Newton. They carried the old
man up to the house and marched Barlow along.
He did not reveal himself, although some of them
recognised him with surprise as the swagman.
Once at the station he requested to see Deane
alone, and told him who he was, asserting that it
was only in self-defence he had struck Bunthorp,
which was literally true, and insisting on being
allowed to depart in search of his horse. Deane
was rather puzzled ; he compromised matters by
sending a black boy after the horse and telling his
brother-in-law that he would not allow him to
leave until Bunthorp was conscious : meantime, if
he wanted any assistance, he had better keep him-
self quiet and not attempt to see his sister.
Between them, Mrs. Deane and Newton had
now recalled the unconscious Bunthorp to life
once more. “I gave it to him, Jim,” were the
first words he spoke. “ Called me old Bun.” Then
he lay back and closed his eyes. Presently he
opened them again ; “Maggie,” he said, “I want
to be alone with Jim for a minute.” Mrs. Deane
nodded and left the room. “Look here, Jim,”
said the old man eagerly, “I’m going to die.”
“Go to blazes !” replied his astonished nephew.
“In about an hour’s time I shall expire,”
repeated his uncle. “No, I’m not wandering.
I’m in solemn earnest. Do you think you could
get me a drop of that old whisky : I feel faint ?”
Newton, with astonishment all over his face,
left the room, and Bunthorp went off into a series
of chuckles; evidently he had got hold of a
brilliant idea.
His nephew returned, and Bunthorp swallowed
the spirits. “ What’s become of that fellow?” he
asked. :
“ Deane has looked him up somewhere. ’
“Right! Now, Jim, I’ll explain myself. So
far as dying is concerned, it would take more than
a knock like that to kill me ; but that scamp is
young Barlow, who, of course, you’ve heard of.
Now, he can’t do any real harm, and Fred is not
the man to be sponged on and robbed, but he
might make things unpleasant. People would
talk, Maggie would feel it, and there might be
trouble between husband and wife, because, after
all, people are only human. Now, if I die—you
twig—Barlow will stand his trial for murder.
Deane gives him a chance to clear out and he’ll
take care never to show up in Queensland again,
where he’ll think there’s a halter waiting for him.
Savee, James?” And the restored Bunthorp dug
his amazed nephew in the ribs.
Barlow was confined in the store ; he had been
reposing on the top of a pile of flour-bags reading
a yellow-back, for some time, when the door
opened and Deane appeared. He appeared greatly
excited. “ The old naan is dead,” he said
hurriedly, “ I can’t see you hanged, for you’re
Maggie’s brother after all. Your horse is tied up
at the paddock gate, the men are at dinner, slip
down through the scrub and be off before Newton
comes, for he’s going to take you into the police-
camp himself.”
“But,” said the other, “it was only man-
slaughter ;he attacked me. I’ll stand my trial.”
“You infernal fool, what show have you got?
Look at your character, who saw him strike you?
who will believe you ? The men took you red-
handed with the whip in your hand. Stay and
be hanged if you like. Newton will swear your
life away, he’s furious.”
“I have very little money,” said Barlow
sullenly.
“ Here, take this, it is enough to pay your
passage and give you a start somewhere. Now,
for God’s sake go, before it is too late.
Barlow moved to the door ; he was beginning to
grasp the situation, and didn’t like it.
“ Keep off the roads,” said Deane, “and slip
out of the country like greased lightning; every-
body liked Bunthorp and they will search high and
low for you.”
Deane stood at the door as though keeping
watch; he saw his brother-in-law disappear in the
first patch of scrub, and that was the last he ever
saw of him.
Few livelier corpses have ever been seen at a
dinner-table than Bunthorp’s was that evening.
Newton said that “ a crack on the cobra” must
have a more stimulating effect on the brain than
any amount of the incomparable whisky.
The Sea Gave Up its Dead.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The troopers were walking slowly and carefully,
one after the other. In fact, there was no other
mode of progression possible, for we were follow-
ing an ill-marked native path through a mangrove
swamp. The four “boys” had nothing on but
their blue twill shirts and a belt of cartridges. In
spite of their bare feet and the pointedly-aggres-
sive shoots of the mangroves that studded the
path, they got on quicker than I did with boots on.
The steam from the flats and the closeness of
the atmosphere—for not a breath of air was
stirring—were causing all of us to perspire pro"
fusely. The black legs of the boys glistened with
moisture, and my shirt was saturated. In the
salt pools, as we tramped through, foul bubbles
would arise and burst, and from the slime on
either side sharp cracks and reports would be
heard. Sometimes an army of blue crabs would
sidle away in haste, suddenly to disappear as if
the black earth had swallowed them up; or
spiney-backed lizards coursed swiftly over the
mud and ran up the leaning trunk of a mangrove,
to gaze at us from a safe position.
I felt relieved when we reached higher ground
and emerged on a little marine plain on the bank
of a salt-water creek, down which the tide was
running rapidly. On the opposite side was a
sandbank and a corresponding small plain ; on the
sandbank an alligator was basking. A little to
our left was a clump of bushy mangroves wherein
a swarm of flying foxes were making their mid-
day camp—some sleeping, some head-downwards,
others flapping about, chattering and whistling :
the vampires of the legends.
We halted on the bank of the creek. The
alligator opposite slid lazily into the water, so
slowly and surely that he disappeared without
leaving a ripple on the moving surface. He need
not have troubled himself—we were after blacks
and had no intention of announcing our presence
by a rifle-shot.
What the blacks had done to bring prospective
punishment on themselves need not be told, it has
nothing to do with the present story. Suffice it to
say that the day before the officer in charge of the
party had staked his foot badly while trying to walk
barefooted in the mangroves, so that he had to
stay in camp with the horses, much against his
will, and I accompanied the boys alone. It was not
the orthodox thing to do, as, according to the
regulations, no outsiders were supposed to be with
a “dispersing” party; but in those days, and
that part of Far Northern Queensland, regulations
were winked at, and the sub-inspector, or lieuten-
ant as he was then called, was only too glad to
have somebody from the station with him for com-
pany’s sake.
This digression explains why I, an unofficial
personage, was standing on the bank of a salt-
water creek, in company with Corporal Fred, a
Dawson boy, and three other black troopers who
hailed from Wide Bay, with the avowed intention
of overtaking and dispersing certain aborigines
who had offended against the Queen’s peace. The
blacks had split up, and the boys had lost the
tracks —I could see that at once when we pulled
up. I was resting under the shade while the boys
scattered about and sought to find out which way the
main body had gone ; a low whistle attracted my
attention. Fred was standing on the bank gazing
earnestly at some object in the water. I got up and
joined him.
Following the direction of his pointing finger, I
saw something approaching, borne down by the
receding tide, that made me start.
“ What name, Fred ?-” I said.
“White fellow —dead fellow !”
The object came closer; Fred gave a whistle of
surprise.
“ White woman, by gum,” he said.
There was no doubt about it; in fact, I ought
to have guessed it before, for the corpse of a
woman always floats face-uppermost, whilst a
man’s floats faee-downwards.
This white face of a woman, with long hair
half shrouding it, was now nearly abreast of
us. The other boys had come up and were silently
watching.
“ We must get it out,” I said to Fred,
dancing down stream, I saw that the creek
took a sharp bend, the projecting point being on
the opposite side; probably the set of the current
would send the body within reach of bur bank.
The black boy noted my glance and ran down to
the bend, where he stationed himself with a long
stick. It would, of course, have been easy enough
to swim in for it, but as, in addition to numberless
alligators, there were probably plenty of sharks,
nobody felt inclined for the experiment.
Fred was successful in his ghastly fishing, and
the poor body was drawn ashore. It was that cf
a dark-haired woman, fully dressed, and had been
in the water some days. Round one of the
swollen fingers was the glint of a wedding-ring
half-buried in the flesh.
“ Missie White,” said one of the boys, as we
gazed at the corpse.
I looked at Fred ; he nodded.
White and his wife kept an accommodation-
house and sly-grog shanty at the crossing of a
river, some short distance to the westward. How
did the body come to be in this blind creek? Had
she got lost and wandered on to it and fallen in ?
All at once the solution flashed upon me. The
White’s shanty was at the head of salt water on
the - X- river ;in all probability this saltwater
creek either ran into the river near its mouth, or
into the sea close by. The corpse had come down
the river, and a returning tide had brought it back
up the creek. It was on its way seaward again
when we arrested the journey.
I scribbled a note on a leaf of my pocket-book,
and sent one of the boys back with it to F ,
telling him he would have to come on it he had to
crawl on all-fours. It was not far to the camp in
a straight line, but it would have been hard work
to carry the body there through the mangrove
scrub. Fred had a tomahawk in his belt, so the
boys set to work digging a grave in the sandy
plain with pointed sticks.
It was late in the afternoon before F limped
on to the scene. He recognised the woman at
once —I had never seen her alive myself. We
then had the repulsive task of seeing if there were
any wounds to account for her death, but ap-
parently she had been drowned. The shallow
grave was ready, and we buried her with such
“maimed rites” as we could remember. After
filling in the grave, we put some logs over it to
mark the place, and left the ill-omened spot to the
flying foxes and the jnosqui toes, which commenced
to swarm down in armies. F agreed with me
as to the way the corpse came to be in the creek,
for the creek was but an estuary, and the head of
it was in trackless mangrove swamps. The blacks
we were in pursuit of had a respite.
F asked me to go with him round to the
shanty, and the evening of the day after we had
buried the woman we arrived there. The cook
and knockabout man was chopping wood outside
the rude shelter that served as a kitchen.
“ White inside ?” said F curtly as we dis-
mounted.
“I expect so,” returned the man sullenly;
“ he’s pretty bad with the horrors —been drinking
too much of his own grog.”
“Where’s Mrs. White?” said F .
“She's in there,” he replied, indicating the
house ; “she’s been sick in bed the last few days.”
“ Haven’t you seen her?”
“No, but I hear him talking to her.”
“ Did you hear her answering him ?”
The man stared. “ What’s up ?■’ he said.
“ Oh, nothing.” returned F , “only I want to
see Mrs. White.”
“Well, she’s there right enough. I’ve heerd
her moving about when he’s bin out of the room.”
F glanced curiously at me and we walked
over to the rough slab house. As we entered the
door White came out of an inner room. He was
evidently pretty bad, but when he recognised
F and saw through the doorway the troopers
standing outside with the horses, he seemed to get
somewhat sober.
He bade us good day and apologised for the
disorder of the place, which certainly looked as
though several free fights had gone on in it, by
stating that his wife was sick and it occupied
most of his time attending to her.
“ Sorry to hear Mrs. White is bad,” said F ;
“ what is it—fever ?”
White nodded, and we both certainly heard,
across the low partition, a movement and a
whisper. This was strange.
“ Can you get us something to eat. We shall
camp here to-night ? ”
“ I am afraid not,” said White reluctantly,
“ everything is so upset, you see.”
“Well, never mind,” returned F , “luckily
we have some tucker with us. I’ll tell the boys to
turn out.”
We left the place, and, after a few words with
Fred. F showed the boys where to camp, and
they commenced to unsaddle. White had followed
us out and now stood talking to the cook.
In the midst of the work we were suddenly
startled by a loud yell and a volley of curses, and
the next instant Fred appeared in full flight round
the corner of the house, followed by White raving
at him and brandishing the axe the cook had
been chopping wood with,
“ You sneaking nigger ! ” he shouted.
“ I’ll knock your brains out! ”
F— and I stepped between with our revolvers
as Fred rushed up.
“ Baal Missie White there, Marmie,” he said as
he passed, “ black gin sit down along a bedroom!”
Fred, acting under instructions, had been taking
a peep through a chink in the slabs when White
discovered him.
The man halted, under cover of the two revol-
vers, but it was only for a moment. Fred’s words
told him that his secret was discovered. He was
rushing at F who was just firing when one
of the troopers picked up a waddy, let fly
with good aim and knocked him down. F ’s
bullet went over his head, and ere he could get up,
half stunned as he was, we had the handcuffs on
him.
Leaving White in charge of two of the boys, we
went to the house, and F going in to the bed-
room returned with a trembling black gin in
custody, who had been playing the part of sick
Mrs. White since her disappearance. The cook
had been calmly smoking his pipe and looking on
at the disturbance, and as the gin was too
frightened to speak, we interrogated him; but, of
course, he knew nothing. Whilst in the middle
of the examination a shout from the boys attracted
our attention. White had given them the slip,
and was running swiftly for the river, the
troopers in pursuit. Strung up to desperation
the madman reached the bank first, and with-
out a pause jumped into the dark hole
beneath. We halted on the bank. He came to
the surface once and gave a choking cry, and then
sank for good.
“Sheol!” cried the cook, “he owed me six
weeks’ wages.”
“It’s just as well,” said F to me, after
trouncing the two boys for their carelessness; “it
has saved me a lot of trouble.”
Neither from the gin nor the cook could we
obtain any information. Probably, in a drunken
fit, he had thrown his wife into the river ; and but
for our stumbling across the body his little strata-
gem would have succeeded until he had a plausible
excuse to account for her disappearance. The sea
never ggve his body back, and after the shanty
was deserted it was soon burnt down.
FELIX SLOWBOY.


Ned Darton's Wife
(For the Bulletin)
Ned “picked up” his wife in Sydney He had
come down for a spell in town, and to relieve him-
self of the distress of riches —to melt the cheque
accumulated slowly in toil and loneliness on a big
station in the North. He was a stockrider, a
slow, still man naturally, but easily moved by
drink. When he first reached town, he seemed to
have with him some of the atmosphere of silence
and desolation that surrounded him during the
long months back there on the run. Ned was
about thirty-four, and looked forty. He was tall
and raw-boned, and that air of settled melancholy,
which is the certain result of a solitary bush-life,
suggested some romantic sorrow to Mrs. Black’s
sentimental daughter.
Darton, taught wisdom by experience, had on
this occasion taken lodgings in a suburban private
house. Mrs. Black’s home was very small, but
her daughter was her only child and they found
room for a “gentleman boarder.” Janet Black
was a pleasant - faced, happy - hearted girl of
twenty. She liked the new-boarder from the
start, she acknowledged to herself afterwards,
but when by some fortunate chance he happened
to be on hand to drag a half-blind and half-witted
old woman from beneath the very hoofs of a run-
away horse, somewhat at the risk of his own neck,
she was enraptured, and in the enthusiasm of the
moment she kissed the hand of the abashed hero,
and left a tear glittering on the hard, brown
knuckles.
This was a week after Ned Barton’s arrival in
Sydney.
Ned went straight to his room and sat perfectly
still, and with even more than his usual gravity
watched the tear fade away from the back of his
hand Either Janet’s little demonstration of
artless feeling had awakened suggestions of some
glorious possibility in Ned’s heart, or he desired
to exercise economy for a change; he suddenly
became very judicious in the selection of his
drinks, and only took enough whisky to dispel his
native moodiness and taciturnity, and make him
rather a pleasant acquisition to Mrs. Black’s
limited family circle.
When Ned Darton returned to his pastoral
duties in the murmuring wilds, he took Janet
Black with him as his wife. That was their
honeymoon.
Darton did not pause to consider the possible
results of the change he was introducing into the
life of his bride—few men would. Janet was
vivacious and her heart yearned towards humanity.
She was bright, cheerful, and impressionable—the
bush is sad, heavy, despairing ; delightful for a
month, perhaps, but terrible for a year. As she
travelled towards her new home, the young wife
was effervescent with joy, aglow with health,
childishly jubilant over numberless plans and
projects; she returned to Sydney before the
expiration of the year, a stranger to her mother in
appearance and in spirit. She seemed taller now,
her cheeks were thin, and her face had a new
expres-ion She brought with her some of the
brooding desolation of the bush—even in the tur-
moil of the city she seemed lost in the immensity
o' the wilderness. She answerel her mother’s
every question without a smile. She had nothing
to complain of: Ned was a very good husband
and very kind. She found the bush lonesome at
first, but soon got used to it, and she didn’t mind
now. She was quite sure she was used to it, and
she never objected to returning.
A baby was born, and Mrs. Darton went back
with her husband to their hut by the creek on the
great run, to the companionship of bears, birds,
■possums, kangaroos, and the eternal trees. She
ugged her baby on her breast, and rejoiced that
he little mite would give her something more to
lo and something to think of that would keep the
awful ring of the myriad locusts out of her ears.
Man and wife settled down to their choking
existence again as before, without comment. Ned
was used to the bush—he had lived in it all his
life, and though its influence was powerful upon
him he knew it not. He was necessarily away
from home a good deal, and when at home he was
not companionable, in the sense that city dwellers
know. Two bushmen will sit together by the fire
for hours, smoking and mute, enjoying each
other’s society; “in mute discourse,” two bush-
men will ride for twenty miles through the most
desolate or the most fruitful region. People who
have lived in crowds want talk, laughter and song.
Ned loved his wife, but he neither talked, laughed,
nor sang.
Summer came. The babe at Mrs. Barton’s
breast looked out on the world of trees with wide,
unblinking, solemn eyes, and never smiled.
“Ned,” said Janet, one bright, moonlight
night, “do you know that that ’nossum in the
big blue gum is crazy ? She has two joeys, and
she has gone mad, ”
Janet spent a lot of her time sitting in the shade
of the hut on a candle-box, gazing into her baby’s
large, still eyes, listening to the noises of the bush,
and the babe too seemed to listen, and the mother
fancied that their senses blended, and they both
would some day hear something awful above the
crooning of the insects and the chattering of the
parrots. Sometimes she would start out of these
humours with a shriek, feeling that the relentless
trees which had been bending over and pressing
down so long were crushing her at last beneath
their weight.
Presently she became satisfied that the laughing-
jackasses were mad. She had long suspected it.
Why else should they flock together in the dim
evening and fill the bush with their crazy laugh-
ter ? Why else should they sit so grave and still
at other times, thinking and grieving?
Yes, she scon got a conviction thatall the animals
and birds, - even the insects that surrounded her,
were mad, hopelessly mad, all of them. The
country was now burnt brown, and the hills
ached in the great heat, and the ghostly mirage
floated in the hollows. In the day-time the birds
and beasts merely chummered and muttered
querulously from the deepest shades, but in the
dusk of evening they raved and shrieked, and
filled the ominous bush with mad laughter and
fantastic wailings.
It was at this time that Darton became im-
pressed by the peculiar manner of his wife, and a
great awe stole over him as he watched her gazing
into her baby’s eyes with that strange look of
frightened conjecture. He suddenly became very
communicative ; he talked a lot, and laughed, and
strove to be merry, with an indefinable chill at his
heart. He failed to interest his wife; she was
absorbed in a terrible thought. The bush was
peopled with mad things—the wide wilderness of
trees, and the dull, dead grass, and the cowering
hills, instilled into every living 'thing that came
under the hideous influence of their ineffable
gloom, a madness of melancholy. The bears were
mad, the ’possums, the shrieking cockatoos, the
dull, grey laughing jackasses with their devilish
cackling, and the ugly yellow-throated lizards that
panted at her from the rocks—all were mad. How
then, could her babe hope to escape the influence
of the mighty bush and the great white plains
beyond, with their heavy atmosphere of despair
pressing down upon his defenceless head ? Would
he not presently escape from her arms, and turn
and hiss at her from the grass like a vicious snake,
or climb the trees, and, like a bear, cling in day-
long torpor from a limb, or, worst of all, join the
grey birds on the big dead gum, and mock at her
sorrow with empty, joyless laughter ?
These were the fears that oppressed Janet as
she watched her sad, silent baby at her breast.
“ It was at this time that Barton became impressed by the peculiar manner of his wife ,
and a great awe stole over him as he watched her gazing into her baby's eyes with that strange
look of frightened conjecture. ”
They grew upon her and strengthened day by
day, and one afternoon they became an agonising
conviction. She had been alone with the dumb
child for two days, and she sat beside the hut and
watched the evening shadows thicken, with a
shadow in her eyes that was more terrible than
blackest night, and when a solitary mopoke began
calling from the Bald Hill, and the jackasses set
up a weird chorus of laughter, she rose, and
clasping her baby tighter to her breast, and lean-
ing over it to shield it from the surrounding evils,
she hurried towards the creek.
Janet was not in the hut when Ned returned
home half-an-hour later. Attracted by the howl-
ing of Ins dog, he hastened to the water-hole
under the great rock, and there in the shallow
water he found the bodies of his wife and child,
nnrl Um dull, grey birds were laughing insanely
overhead.

BILLSON'S
DEPARTURE
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
I was on the literary staff of the Bogalong
Banner at the time. In point of fact I was the
staff—barring the boss, and he was always drunk,
so he doesn’t count. Show-time came, and the
foreman-compositor got drunk —he always did at
show-time—and was locked up for furious riding.
So I had a lot of extra work to do, and laboured
nearly all night for three successive nights, besides
dodging about in the rain on the showground all
day, eluding the grievances of the unsuccessful ex-
hibitors and the whiskies of the prize-takers. Hie
consequences of this foolishness were (1) I got the
paper out —“ a blanky good paper, old boy ” —the
boss said ; and (2) I contracted the very worst
attack of bronchial asthma I ever had in a toler-
ably long experience of that luxury.
Now, Bogalong hasn’t half a bad climate for a
man with brass lungs and india-rubber windpipe,
but being built over a swamp it’s just Sheol for
the asthmatic. Said the doctor, on the third day
of my misery, “ Yuli be pegging oot, ma boy, I’m
thinking, if ye stay here.” Between chokes I
ventured to submit that I—didn’t care much if I
—did. When a man gets fairly gripped by the
asthma-devil, he doesn’t, either.
“ Wull, I’m thinking,” said the doctor, “that
likely ye’d do better up on the hill yonder. A
sma’ bit of elevation often maks a great change.
What dy’e say to tryin’ it ? ” Now the hill was
the site of the hospital, and I had never yet
sampled hospital, and didn’t want to. But I had
to* much chloral on board to care much one way
or the other, and the result was that the old Doc.
carried me out to his buggy and ran me up.
11.
I was quite helpless when I arrived, but the
change of air was effective, for, in two days’ time,
I had improved wonderfully, and was able to
walk out to the verandah and sit in the sun.
Then it was that I became a victim to Billson.
Billson was the wardsman. He was an untidy-
looking ruffian, with an eternally dir-ty and
unshaven face and a red nose. He wore a saddle-
strap for a belt, and usually went barefoot. His
feet also suffered from drought, But we didn’t
mind these things a bit ; we would have welcomed
him—indeed, gloried in him—in any or no attire,
and in any amount of uncleanliness, if he would
only—just for one hour daily, say—have worn a
gag. He used to inflict upon us, all day long (his
wife did all the work, including wood-chopping
and feeding Billson’s horse), inconsequential yarns
of appalling length about his doings in the past—
how he had assisted different doctors in the most
critical cases, and had earned their undying
gratitude for preserving the doctors’ renown;
how the leading surgeons of Sydney used always
to consult him—“ Send for Billson,” they used
to say —when any very difficult operation
was in hand ; how he had interviewed
Parkes and Oarington and Dailey and Lord knows
whom else on different subjects. “ Look here,
Lord Oarington ; you’ve got to deal with me this
time. Me! I says”—with many other fantastic
and gaudy lies. But he was worse at night. He
used to conn in every half-hour or so with a lamp,
sit down on one side of his patients, and talk
some more. It was always his grievances with
the committee that he jawed about at night, and
they were as, inifn'y as the waves of the sea. It was
no use pretending to be asleep. Billson didn’t
care. He’d just splutter away (he stuttered most
abominably, too) for twenty minutes or so, and
then go out, “ singing,” he called it. Then every
man (there were eight of us in the big ward) would
swear a little, and then have a smoke and try to
sleep again, only to dream Billson, and to be
awakened half-a-dozen times before rporning by
fresh incursions of Billson. But it wasn’t to tell
of Billson’s clatter that I started this story.
What I wish to relate is why Billson left us.
It was not on account of his loquacity that the
committee shot Billson into the uttermost dark-
ness, for they were not troubled with it much.
No; Billson might have been in charge of Boga-
long Hospital to this day had it not been for the
ungentlemanly way in which he treated one of us.
It was old Muldoon who burst up the Billson
dynasty.
111.
Muldoon was our senior boarder. He had been
in hospital the greater part of his time for the last
three years. “ Senile decay,” the doctor called
his complaint, but there were times when Muldoon
would liven up wonderfully, and then he used to
be discharged, only to re-appear in a few weeks'
time, apparently on the point of death. Muldoon
used to criticise the hospital diet very severely,
and resolutely refused to eat the preparation Mrs.
Billson made for us every morning, and which she
called “porridge,” but which Muldoon named
“ poultice.” We —the rest of us—had to eat it, or
go hungry, but it was vile. Mrs. Billson was
French, and what is the use of a Frenchwoman
trying to make porridge? Muldoon had a bit of
a pull over the rest of us in another way, for he
used to make Billson give him a whisky every
morning at 11, which I tried in vain to do, for
Muldoon wouldn’t tell how he managed it.
Now, one day, Billson got quite drunk, and it
so happened that Muldoon relapsed into a state of
coma the same day. He never did look to be more
than half alive, but this time we all felt sure that
Muldoon’s end was near. Towards evening he
was sinking fast, and when I went to sleep I was
tolerably certain that poor old Terry would never
see daylight again. Billson didn’t tell us any
yarns that night, and we all had a good sleep.
When I awoke in the morning I looked towards
Muldoon’s corner. His bed was empty. Billson
came in just then, very drunk, and weeping.
“Old Muldoon’s gone at last,” he said, with a
violent hiccough.
“ Dead ?”
“ Yes. Me and the missus stayed with him to
the last. He died at three o’clock this morning.
See what I’ve done to my face ?”
I perceived now that Billson had a severe
eruption of gravel-rash on his countenance, and
his nose was much peeled.
“ I was carrying him out to the dead house, and
fell over that (blanky) hencoop near the wood-
heap, It’s committee-day, too, and they’ll all
swear I was drunk. What shall Ido ? My poor
little wife ! It’ll break her heart if we lose our
place. Them to say I was drunk, too !” and
Billson wept some more. “Tell me what I’d
best do ?”
1 recommended him to get as sober as prac-
ticable before 11, the hour he expected the visiting
committee, and he went out to follow my advice.
But the committee, in three buggies, drove up at
9.30, and we could see that something was "up.”
The president marched up to Billson (who hadn’t
had time even to put some court-plaster on his
face), and said he had heard that a patient had
died during the night. Would Billson kindly
allow the committee to view the body? So Billson
led them across the yard, past the hen-coop (at
which point he described his last night’s misadven-
ture with much dramatic effect) to the dead-house.
The door was not locked, and he opened it and
led the way in in his most impressive manner,
with a countenance showing much suppressed
emotion and many gravel-scratches,
There wasn’t any body there !
IV.
They took Billson into the board-room, andMul-
doon was thsre looking as good as new !
“Gentlemen,” said the President, “Muldoon
came to my place early this morning with a very
strange story. Please repeat it, Muldoon. Don’t
go, Billson. We may want you.”
So Muldoon spoke “ ’Twuz that contraptions
cratur uv a Billson that wuz th’ cause of th’ whole
throuble. He has niver a wan of the rudiments
uy dacency in him whatsoever. Sez Ito him only
yistiddy whin he wuz tarin’ th’ whishky into him
frum th’ patients’ shtore. ‘Me poor child, ’ sez I,
will yez give me an exthry wan to-day, for I don’t
feel quite salubrus like ?’ 4 1 will do nothin’ uv

I 1 ?’ Bez he. Thin I ups and sez to

posed to be full. And I mane, Billson,’ sez I ‘to

sonable frequentious. And I will also * make

wuz cowld mate. It wuz most disenjoyable in
there, so I kern away. An’ it’s th’ thruth I’m
tell in’ ye. gintlemin. with no enlargement whatso
ever.”
“Got anything to say, Billson?” said the
president.
Only that I wish to give you a month’s
notice, said Billson, majestically, “of my inten-
tion to leave.”
“Which we decline to accept,” said the
president, promptly. “ Gentleman, we’ll get some
information now from the live patients.”
And when the committpe got it, they were k>
impressed by it that they dismissed Billson, there
and then, quite forgetting the advisability of first
obtaining a successor. Hence that partially
hushed-up scandal of last year about eight patients
being found in a state of tumultuous drunkenness
in a country hospital. We had only one day’s
liberty, but we made good use of it, and things
hummed. But that is another R. Kipling.
Mr. and Mrs. Billson arc now in charge of a
hospital in Riverina, I hear.

Iso more would she chaff the rough drovers and
send them away with a smile,
No more would she madden her lovers, de-
murely, with womanish guile—
The “prince” from the great Never-Never,
with light touch of lips and of hand
Had come, and enslaved her for ever, a potentate
boarded and tanned,
From the land where the white mirage dances
its dance of death over the plains,
With the glow of the sun in his glances, the
lust of the West in his veins ;
His talk, of long drought-stricken stretches,
when the tongue rattled dry on the lips ;
Of his fights with the niggers, poor wretches, as
he sped on his perilous trips.
A supple thewed, desert - bred rover, with
naught to commend him but this,
That he was her idol, her lover, who’d fettered
her heart with a kiss.
They were wed, and he took her to Warren,
where she Avith his love was content.
But town-life to him was too
foreign, so back to the droving
he went,
A man away down on the border
of “Vic.” bought some cattle
from “Cobb,”
And gave Harry Parker the
order to go to “ the Gulf ” for
the mob ;
And he went, for he held her love
cheaper than his wish to re-live
the old life,
Or his reason might yet have
been deeper—/ called it desert-
ing his wife.
Then one morning his horses were
mustered, the start on the
journey was made—
A clatter, an oath through the dust heard,
was the last of the long cavalcade.
As we stood by the stockyard assembled,
poor child, how she strove to be brave !
But yet I could see how she trembled at the
careless farewell that he gave.
We brought her back home on the morrow, but
none of us ever may learn
Of the fight that she fought to keep sorrow at
bay till her husband’s return.
He had gone, but the way of his going, ’twas
that which she dwelt on with pain—■
Careless kiss, though there sure was no knowing,
when or where he might kiss her again.
He had ridden away and had left her a woman,
in all but in years,
Of her girlhood’s gay hopes had bereft her, and
left in their place nought but tears.
Yet still, as the months passed, a treasure was
brought her by Love, ere he fled,
And garments of infantile measure she fashioned
with needle and thread;
She fashioned with linen and laces and ribbons
a nest for her bird,
While colour returned to her face as the bud of
maternity sth’red.
It blossomed and died ; we arrayed it in all its
soft splendour of white,
And sorrowing took it and laid it in the earth,
whence it sprung, out of sight.
She wept not at all, only whitened, as Death,
in his pitiless quest,
Leant over her pillow and tightened the throat
of the child at her breast.
She wept not, her soul was too tired, for wait-
ing is harrowing work,
And then I bethought me and wired away to
the agents in Bourke ;
’Twas little enough I could glean there, ’twas
* little enough that they knew—
They answered he hadn’t been seen there, but
might in a week, perchance two.
She wept not at all, only whitened with staring
too long at the night,
There was only one time when she brightened,
that time when red dust hove in sight,
And settled and hung on the backs of the
cattle, and altered their spots,
While the horses swept up, with their packs of
blue blankets and jingling pots—
She always was set upon meeting those boister-
ous cattle-men, lest
Her husband had sent her a greeting by one of
them, in from the West.
Not one of them ever owned to him, or seemed
to remember the name
(The truth was they all of them knew him, but
wouldn’t tell her of his shame) ;
But never, though long time she waited, did
her faith in the faithless grow weak,
And, each time the outer door grated, an eager
flush sprang to her cheek—
Twasn’t he, and it died with a flicker, and
what I had long dreaded came :
I was serving two drovers with liquor when
one of them mentioned his name.
“Oh, yes,” said the other one, winking, “on
the Paroo I saw him, he’d been
In Eulo a fortnight then, drinking, and driving
about with ‘ The Queen ’
While the bullocks were going to glory, and
his billet not worth a G d—— ; ”
I told him to cut short the story, as I pulled-to
the door with a slam—•
Too late ! for the words were loud-spoken, and
Skeeta was out in the hall,
Then I knew that a girl’s heart was broken, a§
I heard a loud cry and a fall.
Then came a day when the doctor went home,
for the truth was avowed,
And I knew that my hands, which had rocked
her in childhood, would fashion her shroud;
I knew we should tenderly carry and lay her
where many more lie,
Ah, why will the girls love and marry, when
men are not worthy, ah, why ?
She lay there a-dying, our Skeeta ; not e’en did
she stir at my kiss,
In the next world perchance we may greet her,
but never, ah, never, in this.
Like the last breath of air in a gully, that sighs
as the sun slowly dips,
To the knell of a heart beating dully, her soul
struggled out on her lips.
Bub she lifted great eyelids and pallid, while
once more beneath them there glowed
The fire of Love, as she rallied at the sound of
hoofs out on the road ;
They rang sharp and clear on the metal, they
ceased at the gate in the lane,
A pause, and we heard the beats settle in long,
swinging cadence again;
With a rattle, a rush, and a clatter the rider
came down by the store,
And neared us, but what did it matter? he
never pulled rein at the door,
But over the brow of the hill he sped on with
a low muffled roll,
’Twas only young Smith on his filly; he passed,
and so too did her soul.
Weeks after, I went down one morning to trim
the white rose that had grown
And clasped, with its tender adorning, the
plain little cross of white stone.
In the lane dusty drovers were wheeling dull
cattle, with turbulent sound,
But I paused, as I saw a man kneeling, with
his forehead pressed low on the mound ;
Already he’d heard me approaching, and slowly
I saw him uprise
And move away, sullenly slouching his “ cab-
bage-tree ” over his eyes,
I never said anything to him, as he mounted
his horse at the gate,
He didn’t know me, but I knew him, for the
husband, who came back too late.

WHY?
A Murderer Explains the Incomprehensible
to the Unintelligent.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was a brutal thing. They had been leaning
over the piano together, apart from the other
guests, when, as she idly turned over a page of
music, his lithe, strong fingers curled into her
white throat, and quietly, with the passion less in
his eyes than in his hands, he crushed her down
on the seat with an awful power that left her dead
before they could loosen his grip. And later, at
the watchhouse, when they asked him why he had
done it, he could only say ;
“Why? How can I tell ? We had quarrelled
—it would have been nothing in the open air, but
the lights, the hot room, the buzz of voices, per-
haps they had something to do with it. Or it
may have been a flash from her eyes. I only
know that I touched her beautiful, soft arm, and
then ”
When it was known that the defence was
insanity, aconfident “Pooh ! never do, sir, never
do ; known the lad all my life ; sane as you or I,
sir. He had his reasons, take my word for it!”
repressed all desire for argument. That was just
it. They had known him—most of them—for so
many years ; had watched his development from
a sound and keen collegian to a smart, genial
club-fellow and an accomplished “ society ” man.
They had known his father, a merchant of the
city, and a man who had lived till 78 years of age,
and he had never committed a murder. That is
what they said —that superficial world of his.
Then came the trial. The Crown-Prosecutor
had never been so forceful. With dramatic
intensity he pictured the tragedy : the dazzling
ball-room ; the bright dresses, beautiful forms, and
glowing faces; the graceful damsel in fancied
security stealing a few moments with her lover ;
then the dying tones of the piano, the fateful
swirl of the music-stool, the stifled groan as the
murderer seized his beauteous victim—all entirely
fictional—and the blackened face, a moment since
so fair, so enchanting; the soft, grey eyes, with
their tender, soul-light dimmed forever; the yet
warm corpse swaying over the seat—ah, how the
spectators shuddered and crept forward, and
strained their greedy ears for every word of it!
His Honor and the gentlemen of the jury had
neard the plea of his learned friend, counsel for
the prisoner, but was it not absurd, monstrous, a
disgrace to our common-sense and humanity to
suppose for an instant that the terrible crime was
the act of a man insane, whether temporarily or
otherwise ? There was, fortunately, abundant
evidence to prove that he was sufficiently calm
and collected when dragged from the body of his
victim—his prey—to not only understand, in the
fullest sense, the awful deed w'hich he had
committed, but to attempt to palliate it by a cold-
blooded reference to a quarrel—a sudden after-
thought to protect himself from the just laws of the
country. Did that look like insanity ? No doubt
there had been a quarrel. It was known that he
had endeavoured to assert an authority which the
high-spirited girl had declined to recognise, and
that was the undoubted motive which had led the
prisoner to brutally strangle his betrothed in the
prime and spring-time of her maidenhood.
In anticipation of the defence he had been
examined by scientists in brain-diseases, most of
whom pronounced him as sane as a judge—he
begged his Honor’s pardon—and vigorously intel-
ligent on all subjects put before him. There was
no suspicion of any hereditary taint, and there
was no attempt on the part of the defence to
prove such. How, then, could he be mad ? The
whole thing resolved itself into the admitted fact
that he had killed the girl for no reason other
than that they had had a lovers’ tiff, which, at
best, was the frailest of motives for saving him
from the fate to which he had doomed her —death
by strangulation.
That was what the prosecuting counsel said in
effect—that highly-indignant, superlatively-vir-
tuous gentleman who could lay the flattering
unction to his soul that he had never doomed
anyone to death—with his hands.
Sensation on sensation ; the prisoner abandoned
his defence, and was permitted to make a state-
ment. Without the least trace of emotion, he
said :
“You have been told that I killed, in a fit of
temper, the girl whom I loved. That is nothing.
But why did I kill her ? I loved iier; I strangled
her ; and yet your doctors say ‘ He is calm, cool,
clever; there is no brain-disease ; he is not mad.’
They are right; lam not mad now. But they do
not know, and their science does not seem able to
tell them that, any time in ten years, I might
have committed just such a crime as that now
charged against me. It began, I think, in my
college days, when, in my brightest and best
moods, I felt a peculiar impulse to kill somebody.
There was no brooding, no longing, no passion ;
indeed, so far from having to restrain myself, I
simply wondered at the unnatural feeling, and
smiled at the absurd idea of becoming a murderer.
Even after a long succession of these impulses I
was unaffected by them, save in so far as to
remark that they always came in rny idle, happy
moments, particularly when I was engrossed in
the company of my dearest friends—my mother,
sister, father,,or,.in. fact, anyone for whom I felt a
more than ordinary affection, and always vanished
when I took up work which demanded the closest
attention. Mere acquaintances and people un-
known to me, I viewed with indifference—l could
never have killed a stranger. If I could draw yqii
a picture in which my days were spent in walking
behind people longing to spring upon them and
trample them down, you could account for it—
you would say I was mad. If, again, you knew
that I had passed the midnight hours in planning
and gloating over ingenious brutalities, and hoard-
ing up tales of bloody crimes, and all literature of
such sort, you would hold up your horrified hands
and say, ‘ The man is a maniac ! ’
“ But I can tell you none of these things. I
can only tell you that I have sat by my dear
mother’s side, all affection, all smiles, and felt an
impulse to kill her—an impulse, only without the
slightest will-power. I can only tell you that I
have escorted my sweet sister to a concert, or a
theatre, and, while delighted at her enjoyment,
have felt an impulse ! Can you understand that
1 have been inclined to murder a hundred times,
and yet that I have only murdered once ?
“ Well, 1 came into a fortune and plunged into
society, and the old impulse came again almost
every day. I took up professional work and
quietly fought the thing into an idle dream.
Social engagements multiplied till my whole time
was passed in lounging in drawing-rooms and
dilly-dallying over afternoon teas. Back came
the impulse, and I began to feel that I was born
to kill somebody. But the impression was still so
subtle, so dispassionate, that I remained as calm
and collected as ever, except that I commenced to
wonder which of my friends X w T as going to kill.
That was my deepest thought at any time. But
still no longing, no brooding; in fact, at this
period I was the happiest man on earth, for I
had met and won her, I simply accepted it as an
assured fact that I had to kill, but the details,
the when, where, or how, never once disturbed my
customary equanimity.
“ So, till the night of the ball, when at the
height of the music and gaiety, I was seized with
a conviction that my future victim was amongst
the guests. In the most whimsical fashion, I
wondered if I could settle that point. I felt that
it would be something to know, and selecting my
most intimate friends I began to test myself, by
conversing, dancing, or otherwise engrossing my-
self with them. The result was more than I had
expected—and less. I felt that I could kill them
all; that I ought to, but that I must not. I put it
to the proof with each one by allowing my feelings
to lead me on from theory to practice, but without
avail. If I stretched my hand towards a lady’s
neck it went no further than the lappel of
my coat ; if, when sitting, I rose to throttle
a male friend, I finished by taking him by the
shoulders, and relating a good story ; if, while
dancing, my arm curled in to crush my partner,
it ended in confusion and apology. There was
nothing definite ; nothing but hesitation and dis-
couragement, which seemed to show me that my
fancy had played me false, and my future victim
might remain unknown to me for years.
“ An hour afterwards, I went over to my dar-
ling and strangled her. There was no hesitation
then. I had not applied the test to her because I
had been so constantly with her without experi-
encing any emotion but love, and yet on this
night, when I sought her out to smooth over our
little quarrel—the merest trifle—and looked into
her eyes, I knew, in a flash, that it was she
whom I had waited ten years to kill! There was
no uncertainty. The impulse came as it had never
done before, for it brought with it a wild, black
passion which began only when my cruel fingers
gripped her beautiful throat, and ended when I
had become her murderer—the one passionate
moment of my whole life. If, after this, you can
say why, through ten years of impulse, I did not
kill anyone else, then you can tell me why I killed
her. What do you say now ?”
They hanged him—that is what they said.
You, prosaic Judge; you, unimaginative
money-grubbing jurors; you, greedy clergymen
whose god is not in the stars but in the
land-syndicate; you, dull, sordid trading doctors,
who should have been family butchers; you,
wolfish lawyers who should bargain under
the three balls of Lombardy, will say that the
man was responsible. But I myself saw him in
the dock and I felt that he feigned nothing; I
put myself in his place—l clutched her throat
myself. And standing around in the court I saw
two doctors and watched their faces as they gave
evidence, and saw that they, too, they alone of all
the doctors sworn, could put themselves in his
place—that they, like me, had been on the Border-
land, that they had once at least by a supreme
effort torn themselves away from the awful
fascination of the swiftly-approaching train, of the
high open window fifty feet above the street, of
the fathomless mountain abyss; that they had
suddenly cast away their razors while shaving.

[The above is a graphic definition of the insane impulse
which leads to murder. When the law, which has of late
been hanging the Wilsons and Johnstons and Colstons of
society, fully realises the meaning of that impulse, it
must either abolish capital punishment in such cases, or
else it must kill the assassin, not as a deterrent, for
nothing can deter a murderer, but simply as a precaution.
Almost every man of strongly imaginative mind has felt,
at some time or other in his life, the insane desire to
commit homicide-whether in the form of suicide or mur-
der-and some day the law will sentence such men on a
charge, not of murder, but of being nervous individuals
with deficient will-power. And when that time comes it will
probably hang the writer of “Why”—on a strictly
logical basis.
And then Tiif, Bulletin will get no more good
psychological stories.—Ed. B.]

That Other Fellow.
A TALE OF THE SEVENTIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
unoan Mclntyre
_ |l sat on the cap of the
of horse-breaker, he was
about to mount for the
first time. The colt was
also contemplating Duncan, and wondering what
fresh devilry he meditated. Only a week ago and
he was as free as air; now, he was penned in by
posts and rails, ‘his mouth sore with a breaking-
bit, a roller had been buckled around him in
which he felt as comfortable as a girl in her first
corset, his mane and tail had been pulled, and to-
day a saddle had been girthed on him—all these
indignities he justly attributed to the man “cocka-
tooing” on the fence. He had been violently
taking it out of himself bucking round the yard,
and now stood breathlessly gazing at his enemy.
Duncan knocked the ashes out of his pipe, re-
placed it in his pouch, and sprang lightly down
into the enclosure. A blackfellow, who had been
sunning himself in a corner, arose also on noticing
the movement. Between fear and exertion the
colt was sweating profusely, the perspiration
dropped from his body on to the dusty ground,
and ran in dirty streams down his legs.
The pair looked in each other’s eyes like two
duellists. Neither man nor horse could foresee
the future; there they were on an equality of
ignorance. No instinct could tell the animal that
a time would come when he would appeal to his
hated foe with piteous whinnies for relief, and die
with that hand caressing him, and those eyes full
of unshed tears for his fate.
The blackboy approached the horse’s head while
Duncan made the usual preparations to mount.
*“My word !” said the boy as he got hold of the
colt’s ear, “ this the fellow Sherman Jarley say,
kick out mid his front feet that time we brand
him.”
“Yes, Billy,” returned Duncan, flipping the
stirrup-leather once or twice against the flap of
the saddle; and if you don’t let go quick he’ll
shake hands with you as he did with German
Charley. Now!”
With a quick, easy movement he was in the
saddle, and the boy stepped back. For a moment
the colt stood motionless, then started pawing
and rearing, and again stood doggedly still.
“Get your horse, Billy,” said Mclntyre, and
fffg’ boy, after letting down the rails, mounted an
old hofse which had been standing indifferent and
half-asleep in an adjacent yard; then the colt,
after a little coaxing, went off quietly down the
paddock alongside the old stager.
Duncan Mclntyre was a gentleman who had
gone down in the world. He was one of the
victims of heredity ; only, unfortunately for him-
self, he had not succeeded to the whisky-proof
head of his Scottish ancestors. Liquor ever turned
him from a generous, easy-going, mild-tempered
fellow into a mad rowdy, ready to ride a wild
■race through the main street of a bush township,
fight with his best friend, or drink with his worst
enemy. Fortunately, his manly, adventurous
character had prevented him sinking into the
ranks of the sponger and the loafer. He had
fallen from his own set to an ordinary bush hand,
and could always earn a good cheque at any kind
of work, but this Jwas surely followed by the fatal
and inevitable “ spree some morning he would
awake possessed of nothing but the clothes he had
slept in, “ a liver,” a blue-blanket and a bottle of
sudden-death kindly given him by the publican to
stave off the impending “horrors.”
One day Fate led him to Darromine, a medium-
sized cattle - station. Mitford, the managing
partner, was a man gifted with an exceptionally
good and kindly heart. He knew Mclntyre’s
story,, soon recognised the worth dormant beneath
the assumed roughness of the fallen nature, and,
after some trouble, induced him to come and live
with him, and endeavour to resume once more the
habits of his better days. Naturally, the besetting
sin betrayed itself from time to time, but Mit-
ford set himself to banish the unclean spirit, and
by untiring vigilance, unaccompanied by any
■ostentatious display of solicitude, he partly suc-
ceeded. Needless to say that Duncan had con-
ceived a strong and lasting friendship for the
other.
11.
Some fifteen miles from Darromine there was a
small township, and in that township lived the fair
and only daughter of the police-magistrate thereof,
a widower. She was nineteen and the belle of the
district. Not that she prided herself on that dis-
tinguished position, for there were only five girls
in the district, all told, and the other four were so
uncommonly hard-featured that to be the acknow-
ledged belle in such company was, after all, but a
•doubtful distinction. Doubtless Miss Jennie
Webster cherished a hidden conviction, in which
■she was quite justified, that, had she to compete
with more favoured rivals she would have held her
■own ; but this notion she kept to herself, and did
not assume any undue airs as the belle of Corraville.
•Jennie smiled upon all alike, but favoured no one
in particular.
Now, it happened that the very day on which
Duncan gave the colt his first lesson had been
selected by Mr. Webster to drive his daughter to
Darromine on a visit. Mclntyre and Billy were
walking the horses quietly homeward along the
•Corraville-road, which led through the paddock,
when at a turn amongst some scrub they were
suddenly overtaken by the buggy. The colt shied
violently and commenced to buck. It was rather
awkward in the scrub, and Duncan was nearly
getting into trouble two or three times ere he
brought his green mount under control. After
■offering his apologies for unintentionally frighten-
ing the colt, which the young lady accompanied
with a frank smile of admiration, for most women
like to see good horsemanship, the police-magis-
trate and his daughter drove on.
“What a quiet man that Mr. Mclntyre is,”
said Jennie, “ I can never get half-a-dozen words
out of him ; but he can ride.”
Her father smiled somewhat grimly; Mcln-
tyre’s past was known to him, and he was glad to
see the change that was being worked,
Mitford was one of Jennie's victims. For a
long time he had been ready to lay himself and
his share of Darromine at her feet; the present
visit, therefore, translated him to the seventh
heaven.
“ How well you ride, Mr. MTntyre,” said Miss
Webster in the course of the dinner; “I must
confess I like to see a bit of good buckjumping.”
Duncan smiled. “ I nearly came to grief under
that low brigalow though,” he said.
“ I saw it,” she returned ; “and I can assure
you my heart was in my mouth, for it was all our
fault.”
“ How does he shape?” asked Mitford, alluding
to the colt,
“ Very well indeed. I have taken a great fancy
to him, he lias no vice—it’s only nervousness. In
a week he’ll get confidence, and in a month I’ll
make a lady’s hack of him.”
“There! Miss Webster,” said Mitford; “may
I send him in for you to ride this day month if
Mclntyre guarantees that he is fit ?”
“ Certainly, I accept the challenge,” she re-
turned, for she was a good horsewoman. “I will
rely upon Mr. Mclntyre’s skill and judgment.”
Duncan bowed and the subject dropped; but
thenceforth the colt, christened Challenger,
became the object of special care and attention.
The month passed, and Miss Webster, arrayed
in a workmanlike habit of dark-blue serge,, was
seated on the verandah reading a book, and occa-
sionally glancing along the road which led to
Darromine. A rider with a led horse presently
made his appearance, but, sooth to say, the young
lady looked slightly disappointed. “He might have
come too, to see how the colt went,” she thought.
“ Are you ready, dad ? ” she called out; “ here
comes Mr. Mitford with the horse.”
Mitford rode into the stable yard, and the
magistrate and his daughter came out to inspect
the colt. What a difference to the sullen, fierce-
eyed rebel who had snorted defiance at his enenfiy
only thirty days before !
“Oh, dad, isn’t he a beauty!” cried the little
lady in her delight.
“Mclntyre has handled him so that a child
could ride him, but he is full of pluck all the
same,” said Mitford, delighted at her pleasure.
Challenger was soon saddled, and the three set
out; the trim-figured Jennie forgetting her annoy-
ance at the non-appearance of Mclntyre in the
pleasure of her mount. The ride was a success,
and thenceforth Challenger was entirely at Miss
Webster’s disposal.
It is impossible for a man and a girl to be on the
verge of a violent passion for each other without
both knowing it, although never a word may have
been interchanged on the subject. Jennie had
not quite suffered herself to fall in love with the
interesting Duncan, but she was perilously near it.
Mclntyre himself was lost. He had fought
against the feeling tooth and nail; had told him-
self over and over again that the curse which
shadowed his life made it a heinous crime for him
to think of marriage; and had almost won the
fight. Suddenly the fatal knowledge came to him
that it needed but a word from him to obtain the
confession of her affection. The flower was
unfolding for him to pluck. He almost threw
caution to the winds. Almost—not quite.
Mitford came back from Corraville one evening
with his sunny face clouded ; he had ventured
all, and lost.
“lam sure she would have had me, old man,”
“ His friend had dragged him out of the sun into the only shade there was on that hare plain."
he innocently confided to his friend, “ but there’s
another fellow in the way; she as good as
admitted it.”
Duncan was silent for some time; then he rallied
his companion, and somewhat roused him from his
despondency.
“ Look here, Mclntyre,” said Mitford, “ You
have heard of the country out west beyond
the Queensland border? We are thinking of tak-
ing a bit up, and sending out some of our spare
stock to form a station. Will you go out and
manage for us for a third share and a salary ? ”
Duncan rose and shook the other’s hand.
“ Your offer is too generous. You could get a man
anywhere for a couple or three hundred a year.”
“No, we couldn’t, not such an all-round man
as you. Besides, it’s not all beer and skittles
living out there. What with fever and blacks
and short commons, you’ll earn your third share.”
“ When do you propose to start ? ”
“You and I and a blackboy will go as soon as
possible and inspect the country. When we come
back we will start the cattle, provided we find
anything good enough.”
After a few more words they parted for the
night. Mclntyre lay sleepless, thinking of what the
day had brought forth. She might have accepted
Mitford, but for that other fellow. He, Duncan
Mclntyre, the ne’er-do-well, was “that other
fellow.” His way was clear : before him lay
escape from the temptation of love, and perhaps a
drunkard’s death—he must go, and go quickly
without speaking.
Of a sudden he asked himself would she forget
him? Would not his exile in the wilderness
arouse the very flame he sought to extinguish, by
adding the touch of absence and romance ? No,
that other fellow must go under in a way that
would conclude the matter. Mitford on his return
would probably get a favourable answer. “ That
other fellow ” went under that night, although
Mitford on his restless bed little thought so.
Mclntyre had broken out again. That was the
last news in the little township where news was
so scarce. Everybody said they had expected it
all along, and everybody, saving the local pub-
licans, said they were very sorry. It had been
“an old man spree.” Duncan had damaged the
sergeant of police, who was good-naturedly trying
to induce him to leave town. Mitford had to
come in and bail him out of the lock-up. Jennie
had heard of it, and shed some bitter tears, but,
with all a woman’s faith in the reforming power
of love, still believed that had she the right she
could exorcise the evil spirit. Alas for Jennie,
the worst was yet to come.
Mclntyre went “on the tear” again, and this
time capped all his former delinquencies. One of
the publicans had imported a new barmaid, a
young damsel with gold-washed hair. Duncan
rode Challenger into town, and an hour or two
afterwards Flossie might have been seen steering
the colt down the main street in the sight of all
people. Jennie saw her, saw this garish young
party mounted on the horse that had been kept
sacred to her use, that Mclntyre had devoted
weeks to breaking in for her. Challenger, her pet
who ate sugar from her hand !
From that moment poor Duncan was to her a
thing Of the most bitter scorn and contempt. He
might have damaged the whole of the police-force
and painted the town scarlet, and been forgiven ;
but this insult was too much. That other fellow
went under for good and all.
One small bit of triumph was afforded her.
The vain-glorious Flossie, flushed with the pride
that precedes a fall, took opportunity, when
parading before the P.M.’s house, to give
Challenger a cruel and undeserved out across the
ears. This for a horse of spirit, accustomed to be
treated as a gentleman, was unendurable. Already
irritated by the antics of his strange rider, he
gave a side-bound that seated Flossie, to her sud-
den astonishment, in the middle of the dusty road.
Challenger trotted off, and the forlorn damsel,
holding up her skirt, had to follow on foot, amidst
much chaff from the spectators.
Mitford got Mclntyre out of town, somehow.
Hurt as he was, he refrained from reproach, and
he was rewarded. Ere they started he asked once
more, and this time he was told, “When you
come back I may say ‘ yes.’ ” What more would
he have?
Only once did Jennie allude to the disgraceful
episode. “ I hope you are taking that horse with
you ; I never want to see him again.” Mitford
assured her that the innocent animal which had
done its best to protest against indignity, would
never more be seen by her, little dreaming of a
time to come when life and hope would be bound
up in Challenger’s endurance and his rider’s faith.
They parted, and Jennie, watching, saw another
horseman join him in the main street, and she
turned into the house with a bright sparkle in her
eye and a flush upon her cheek.
111.
A wide stretch of grey plain, bounded by a
shimmering haze, a haze that grotesquely magni-
fies what few objects are visible ; turning a stone
into a rock, a bush into a tree. A shallow de-
pression, bordered by dry polygonum bushes, with
here and there a crooked, distorted coolibah
tree, threads this plain. At one point in this
apology for a creek, there is a pool of
milky-looking water. From the edge of this
pool a short growth of green grass extends for
a little distance up the bank, and on this patch of
sward, the only green thing visible, some horses
are feeding. Under a scanty shade of boughs,
erected near one of the largest coolibah trees,
Mitford and Mclntyre are sitting, blackened by
sun and wind, thin with semi-starvation, and
cursed with “ the infinite torment of flies.” The
blackboy is curled up under the trunk of the tree.
He lets the flies cluster around his eyes, infest his
mouth and nostrils, and makes no effort, like the
white men, to drive them away. The others are
less patient, and a hasty exclamation continually
escapes them. “When shall we get out of this
purgatory ?” says Mitford.
They were in a trap. They had penetrated far
into the unknown country west of the Queensland
border. From one scanty water-hole to another
they had made their way to their present position,
and now they could neither advance nor retreat.
Before them there was an illimitable expanse of
dry country ; behind them the water-holes had
dried up, and their return was cut off. Sturt, at
the Depdt Camp, was in the same fix, and scores
of men since have been caught in a similar way.
A hundred and twenty miles of dry, cracked,
gaping plains lay between them and a large per-
manent lagoon they had found on their outward
journey. No horse could travel that distance
without water under the vertical summer sun.
No horse could traverse half the distance over the
soft, spongy soil full of holes and deep cracks, and
live. Their only hope was a kindly thunderstorm,
for the water-hole where they were camped was fast
shrinking, and when that was gone it meant death.
Day after day they watched the clouds gather,
dark and threatening, only to break in wind and
dust, and a few tierce flashes of lightning.
At last, an ominous cloud gathered in the east.
As night drew on, the heavens darkened and the
setting sun was reflected from the opposite hemi-
sphere in a quickly-fading flush of angry scarlet.
A black night closed in. The air was heavy,
oppressive and sultry ; the two men and the boy
stood silently watching. Their fate was hidden
in that sullen bank of vapour. Quick, bright
flashes of lightning soon commenced to blaze,
followed, after a long interval, by a low, distant
mutter of thunder. Presently even this ceased,
and, with a sigh of bitter disappointment, the
men stretched themselves on their blankets and
sought forgetfulness in sleep.
“How far off was that storm?” said Mitford,
breaking the silence.
“Any distance over seventy miles,” returned
Duncan. “ Did you not notice the long interval
between the flash and the thunder ? ”
Mitford replied wearily, and both men soon slept.
In an hour or two Mclntyre awoke, and in-
stantly noticed a change in the atmosphere. The
wind was blowing faintly from the direction of the
late storm,' and with it came the unmistakeable
smell of wet earth. Rain had fallen to the east-
ward at last. The wind had brought the message,
but from how far had it come?
Duncan aroused Mitford, and together they
stood and sniffed the cool, damp air.
“We must get out of here somehow,” said
Mclntyre at last. “ Now, listen. lam going to
take Challenger and a pack-horse with water, and
ride in the direction that wind comes from ; I have
the bearing, a little south of east. I will let the
pack-horse go in about twenty miles, after I have
given Challenger a drink from the bags; the
pack-horse will come back here. I shall go on
until I find where that storm fell. If I don’t
come back you will know it is too far, and that I
am done for; then you must shift for yourself. If
I find water I shall come back.”
“ But, Duncan, what nonsense ! Why can’t we
all go and chance it ? ”
“Because I might get a little puddle of water
that would serve me and the horse and would not
be enough for all of us. Man, don’t you under-
stand ! I owe you a debt and must pay you in
my own way. For Cod’s sake, don’t thwart me.”
Mitford could say no more. Mclntyre roused up
Billy, and they strode into the darkness after the
horses, which were soon caught, and, under the
now starlit sky, the two men said good-bye.
About three hours after daylight, Mclntyre
pulled up, watered Challenger by means of a tin
dish he had on the pack, then released the pack-
horse to find its own way back to camp, and pro-
ceeded on his lonely way. Hour after hour of
monotonous progress over the dead, dry plain, the
only break an occasional shallow depression bor-
dered with brown polygonum. Hour after hour
through the great stillness of the night, save for
a short occasional rest for his gallant horse.
Daylight again, and the outlook unchanged—no
sign of rainfall visible. As the sun got hotter
Challenger began to show signs of distress, so
Duncan started to walk, and together man and
horse stumbled over the treacherous plain. He
had a small canvas bag of water on his saddle, but
only a scanty remnant of the former contents was
now left. Death was walking beside them, step
for step.
At last Challenger began to give in. His flanks
were pinched and the hollows over his eyes deep
sunken; he rubbed his nose against Duncan’s
arm, whinnied, and looked pleadingly at him.
These are the things to break a man’s heart in the
wilderness. Still there was nothing in sight but
the heat-haze and the tall columns of dust raised
by the wandering whirlwinds that crossed their
track. A false step and the horse went down.
Mclntyre tried to get him up, but Challenger
was too far gone—he must proceed alone. Wetting
his lips with a few drops of the water fast
evaporating from the bag, he went forward on the
course he had been keeping.
Suddenly, right in front of him, rose a small
flock of birds. They wheeled and chattered and
settled down again ! It could only mean water,
for since leaving camp he had seen no living thing,
and now he recognised the birds as spur-winged
plover.
With perspiration nearly blinding him, he
staggered on, and then he must have crossed the
crest of an almost imperceptible rise, for before
him the plain was covered with sheets of shallow
water. He had reached the extreme edge of the
thunderstorm.
When Duncan lifted his face from the tepid
pool after slaking his thirst, his first thought was
of the dying horse on the plain. lie filled his felt
hat and the bag, and dragged himself back to
his dumb companion. Challenger lifted his
head when he saw him, and whinnied piteously.
Four times more he made the journey back-
wards and forwards, and then the plucky
horse managed to get on its legs and follow
him down to the water. There was a soli-
tary coolibah tree not far off, and in the miserable
shade that it afforded Duncan sat down and tried
to eat some of the dried horse-flesh he had brought
with him. He was conscious of a fearful head-
ache—he had been bareheaded when carrying
the water to Challenger. He must get back as
soon as possible, for the water on the plain was
but a few inches deep and fast evaporating. Still
he must spell his horse ; after such an ordeal
the colt would not carry him half-way without
rest. At last he felt too stupid to think, and sank
into a sleep that lasted until sundown. His head
was still throbbing painfully when he awoke, and
he arose and bathed it in one of the pools, but the
water was warm and afforded him no relief.
Challenger seemed greatly recovered, and was
feeding on the dry Mitchell grass.
One thought haunted Duncan during the en-
suing night of pain—the scorching ride back over
the drought-smitten country. Suddenly a whisper
seemed to come from the darkness, “Why go
back ?” To the eastward the country was well
watered, and a few easy stages would take him to
the Queensland border and safety. Mitford would
wait, and at last give him up, start back on some
other course, and probably perish. It was one or
other of them. The colt would not carry him
more than half-way back to camp; then he must
walk, and the sun would soon make an end of him.
All through the dark hours of semi-delirium the
voices from the surrounding solitude kept up the
refrain, “Why go back?”
On the fifth day after Mclntyre’s departure
Mitford started on Duncan’s tracks with a pack-
horse laden with water, hoping to encounter him.
The pool was failing rapidly and in a few days
would be dry. Fifteen miles from camp he
thought he saw a figure moving towards him. It
could only be Mclntyre, for in that solitude there
was no living soul but themselves. He hastily
dismounted, and, water-bag in hand, hurried to
meet him. Duncan did not know him; he was
blindly, instinctively following his tracks back to
the camp, and it was not until Mitford had poured
the water over his head and breast and down his
baked throat that his bloodshot eyes lost some of
their wildness. His friend had dragged him out
of the sun into the only shade there was on that
bare plain—underneath the belly of the pack-
horse. Here he lay a while with his eyes half-
closed. At last he began to speak coherently.
“ I’ve got back, old man. Follow my tracks out
and you will get to the water, but be quick, for
it’s drying up fast. Boor old Challenger ! I shot
him—it was all I could do for him ; he never gave
in until he was dying.” His head fell back on his
friend’s knee, and he was silent for a time. “ I
must go on,” he muttered presently. “ Blast that
sun !it has done for me; but I will get back
and he struggled to rise. Mitford kept him down,
and he sank into unconsciousness once more.
An hour passed during which Mitford kept
pouring water over the burning head; then
Duncan opened his eyes and his friend saw that
his senses had returned. “Mitford, old man, I
tell you that you must go back to camp and
start at once, or it will be too late. The water
is so shallow it will dry up in a day or two. Poor
old Challenger, you’ll see his body as you go ; but
start now and you’ll get home safe. That other
fellow is going another road. Good-bye.”
And soon that other fellow was gone.

THE MYSTERY OF BAINE'S
DOG
HE trouble was first caused by the Malin-
gers, and, needless to say, it was a case
of chtrchez la femme. One of the youth-
ful members of that tribe had forcibly abducted
a maiden of the clan of Layovah, and red
war ensued. The worst of it was that they
selected as convincing-ground a spot close to
a much-frequented cattle-camp, on the boundary
of two large runs where the herds met. This
greatly extended the circle of commotion, I he
noise and tumult of battle, ‘‘the thunder
of the captains and their shouting,” coupled
with the shrill yells of the gins, were enough
to unsettle the temper of any well-regulated
beast, and at the end of the engagement the
casualties were—one blackfellow seriously injured
by falling over a stump during the heat of combat,
two slightly scratched, and one gin very hoarse
through screeching. The cattle scattered to the
four winds. Most of the Seldon Downs beasts
fled on to Inverlochy, and most of the Inverlochy
ones to Seldon Downs—all vowing in their bovine
hearts never again to set foot on that camp.
So two stations, whereon the owners had dwelt
for years in peace and amity, fell out on account
of an obscure aboriginal quarrel. Jack Bell, of
Seldon Downs, said it was the fault of Tom
Devine, who should have kept his niggers in
better order ; and Devine said that Bell knew as
much about managing blacks as he did about
squaring the circle. The cattle were soon mustered
and put right, but the remarks were repeated and
remembered.
The two erstwhile friends ware in this em-
bittered state when Baines, the hawker, w; s
murdered at the old boundary hut. Then tlie-
smouldering feud broke out. Devine maintained
that it was evident the man was killed by the
natives on Bell’s station ; and Bell held it as his
conviction that the unfortunate fellow met his
death at the hands of whites, probably some men
lately discharged from Devine’s. So the matter
stood when our story opens, and the ends of
justice were finally defeated because the
Malingers quarrelled with the Layovahs. It is
as well to trace things back to their first cause.
I.
Dick Baines, the hawker, had been murdered ’
of that there was no manner of doubt. He had
camped at the boundary-hut, an old, deserted
sheep-station, and a traveller passing the next
day found him lying alongside his dray with his
head cut open. His own axe, with a blood-stained
blade, lay beside the body. Evidently he could
not have done it himself. On that point everyone
agreed.
His horses were safe, and his goods apparently
untouched, and herein lay the mystery of the
crime. He had only just started on his round
with a full load, and what little money he had
taken w'as found on his body. There seemed no
motive for a white man to commit the deed, and
if any of the blacks had done it, why had they not
sacked the dray ? It was an enigma worthy of a
first-class detective-story. Meantime, during its
elucidation, there was nothing to do but hold an
inquest over what was once Baines, bui j it, and
let the law do the rest.
The deceased had been some time in the dis-
trict and was noted for Ids reserved manner. He
always travelled and camped alone, and seldom
drank. He was not extremely popular, and most
people suspected that lie had “a past. One
singular feature of the tragedy was that his dog, a
smart little fox-terrier, had disappeared. The
matter had almost run the orthodox nine days,
when interest in it was suddenly revived by the
arrest of a man in the small township of Boolah, a
short distance from the scene of the murder, who
was formally charged with the crime. He had
Baines’ dog with him.
McFarlane, the man accused, was well known
in the district and bore an excellent character.
He had been working at Devine’s on a fencing
contract and had been paid off and left the morn-
ing before the hawker was killed. Had started
for Seldon Downs, the road to which led past the
boundary-hut. Thence he had gone round by two
other stations to Boolah. He stated that he found
the dog astray in the township, recognised it as
the missing animal, called it by name, and the
dog followed him. He was about to inform the
police when he was arrested by the sergeant.
Scarcely had the surprise occasioned by this
been well digested, before a more astonishing fact
turned up. Baines’ dog was also found in a
blacks’ camp on Seldon Downs.
One of the men riding by the camp noticed a
gin scuttling away with something in her arms
that yelped and struggled. Rounding her up, he
found she was vainly trying to conceal Baines
well-known and apparently übiquitous dog.
Further search revealed nothing more, and the
gin made the astounding assertion that the dog
had been given her by a white woman. Beyond
that no intelligible information could be elicited
from her. The blacks were well watched and the
dog taken down to Boolah, where McFarlane was
to appear before the magistrates’ court.
It now transpired that there were two dogs
marked exactly the same, identical in size and
appearance, and both answering to the name of
“ Rattler.” But the question was, which of the
pair was Baines’ dog ? Never since the judgment
of Solomon had law-court a more knotty problem.
The animals on being introduced promptly fell on
each other tooth and claw, and were with diffi-
culty separated. Bell and Devine, both J.sF.,
were sitting on the bench with the police-magis-
trate They differed in opinion. Bell declared
that the dog found with McFarlane was the dead
hawker’s; Devine was equally confident that the
dog found on Seldon Downs w’as the one wanted.
After much heated discussion Bell left the bench
and desired to give evidence.
He stated that the last time he saw Baines, the
hawker showed him a trick he had been teaching
his dog. It was an old and well-known per-
formance. The dbg sat up on his hind legs with
a piece of meat or biscuit balanced on the tip o I
his nose; at the words “ready, present, fire!
he tossed it up, caught and swallowed it, and
dropped on all-fours again. 801 l selected the dog
he thought was the hawker’s, and put him through
the performance amidst the hushed attention of a
crowded court-room. It was a complete success,
and he looked up with an air of triumph.
“ Yes. That’s the dog found on Seldon Downs,
said Devine from the bench.
“Nothing of the sort,” returned Bell hotly,
forgetting his position as witness. “ It’s the dog
found with McFarlane.”
Devine was indignantly replying, when the
P.M. interfered and asked the sergeant which dog
it was. The sergeant looked at the dogs, then at
the two policemen, and they looked blankly back
at the sergeant. Then the truth burst upon every-
body with such suddenness that a roar of laughter
convulsed the court. .
The two dogs had got so irretrievably mixed
in the fight that now no one could tell one from
the other.
When order was restored (Bell and Devine had
nearly come to blows) the P. M. decided to remand
the case for a week. Bail was allowed McFarlane,
which Devine readily found. One of the dogs, the
one which could perform the trick, was ordered to
have a collar put on for distinction, and both were
given in charge of the lock-up keeper. The en-
quiry had simply complicated matters. Baines’
dog was identified, but nobody could say for cer-
tain at which place it had been found. Bell and
Devine were, of course, equally positive, but that
was mere party feeling. Most people believed in
McFarlane’s innocence, but Bell vowed that he
would bring the murder home to him.
“ Can you recall anything suspicious the night
you passed Baines ?” said Devine to McFarlane,
as they went out after signing the bail-bonds.
“No, sir. He had hobbled his horses out and
was lighting a fire. I got off, lit my pipe, and
stopped yarning for about twenty minutes. Then
I went on to Seldon Downs.”
“ And from there ? ”
“ I came to Boolah by Thirglemere and Bingle-
doon. I had been here about two hours when I
recognised the dog, and directly after I had
coaxed him to follow me, I was arrested.”
“ From the boundary-hut, going round b”
Seldon Downs, Thirglemere, and Bingledoon, ; ■ u
made it about eighty miles to here and
took your time ? ” .
“ I stopped two days at Thirglemere and two at
Bingledoon. I was a week coming here alto-
“ But anyone could ride from toe boundary-hut
straight in to here in about thirty-five miles.
“ Yes, by the old j;rack, but you have fenced
fUnf TIOVV. ,,
“ The wires could be easily strapped down, or
cut, for that matter. Let’s see, I don’t suppose
it’s been used for years, and there has been no
rain since Baines was killed. I’m going to run
the old track.”
“Will they let me go with you?”
“ I’ll fix that,” said Devine—and the next
morning the two departed for the old track to the
boundary-hut.
During their absence, however. Bell was not
idle. He returned to the station, and, after much
ado, he had the old gin, from whom the dog had
been taken, brought into Boolah. As they arrived
Devine and McFarlane rode in, returning from
their trip to the old hut.
On being shown the two dogs, the gin imme-
diately claimed the one without the collar as
being her property. This was satisfactory, to
Bell at any rate, but at this moment Devine came
upon the scene. Disdaining to do more than
civilly sneer at the test just gone through, he
drew the sergeant on one side and held a short
conference with him. The sergeant disappeared
with the two dogs; the others waited, Bell scorn-
fully impatient. Presently the two dogs reap-
peared. On being told to pick out her dog, the
gin at once selected the collarless one.
“That’s the other one this time, is it not, Ser-
geant ?” said Devine. .
“Yes, sir ; I shifted the collar just now.
“It’s not fair!” broke in Bell. “ The poor
devil’s frightened out of her wits ; she picked
right the first time, but you’ve bothered her;”and
he marched out of the yard in deep disgust.
When Devine and McFarlane left the township
they did not trouble to look for tracks until they
were well clear of all the stray animals. When
about ten miles away the old bridle-path was quite
plain Both men rode on in silence, scanning the
ground carefully ; at times, with a low whistle,
one would call the other’s attention to something
he saw. Just as they got within sight of the
fence, they pulled up.
“ It’s plain enough, McFarlane,” said Devine,
“a horse has been ridden along here about the
time of the murder.”
McFarlane nodded. “We shall make sure at
the fence,” he answered, and they rode on. It
was a wire fence, and where it crossed the track
the wires were taut and evidently untampered
with. The two turned and rode along the fence in
opposite directions. A shout from McFarlane
brought Devine back to him. He had come to
a panel that bore marks of rough usage, from the
way the upper wires sagged. “The top wires
have been strapped down and then brushed
across,” said the fencer, pointing to the withered
boughs lying about.
“And the horse did not fancy tackling it,’
added Devine; “look how he has been hanging
back.” Inside the fence the ground was much
more" bare and dusty, and the tracks of a horse’s
stamping hoofs deeply indented were plainly
visible. . , ...
“ Whew !” said McFarlane, getting through the
fence, “ look here !” Devine followed him. On a
particularly dry and dusty bit of ground was the
plain imprint of a boot. There should have been
nothing strange in this to make the men stare so
intently at it ; it was only what they might have
expected to find.
Placing his hand on McFarlane’s shoulder to
steady liimself, Devine put his foot down close to
the track without actually touching the groftnd.
The difference in size was at once apparent.
“Either a boy or a woman,” said Mcl*arlane^
“ And the gin said a woman gave her the dog,
returned the other.
Carefully getting back so as not to deface the
tracks, the two men mounted and rode a short
distance down the fence to where they knew was
a small gate. Making for the old bridle-path
again, they followed it on the hut,
McFarlane drawing Devine’s attention to the
track of a small dog now plainly visible on that of
the horse. . , , , , ...
They stayed that night at the old sheep-station,
but no further evidence rewarded their careful
search, beyond the fact that some blacks had
camped in the neighbourhood, apparently about
the date of the murder. They returned to Boolah
in time for Devine to be present at the dog-test,
as already narrated. McFarlane met him as he
was coming out.
“It has just struck me to whom that second
dog belongs,” he said.
“ Whose is it ?”
“Mrs. Brown’s; you know, at Boomerang
Creek.” . .
“ By Jove, you’re right,” said Devine. It
must have been stolen from there.”
Devine was doubtful whether to communicate
the discovery of the suspicious track to the police
or not. Against his better judgment he did so,
thinking it his duty. They went out, accompanied
by Bell, who volunteered his services, examined
the track, and reported that it had been made
some time since the hawker’s death, and so had
nothing to do with that occurrence. In this they
were partly prompted by Bell, and partly by the
fact that as they had searched for tracks, without
success, at the time of the murder, it would never
do for them to go back on themselves. Devine
cursed himself for a fool, and that was all he could
do. When McFarlane’s case came on again he
was, of course, discharged. The evidence was
altogether too slight, and several people came for-
ward and testified to having
seen the dog in Boolah
before McFarlane’s arrival.
“ I’ll find out about that
other dog,” said Devine
to himself.
11.
Nearly forty miles
from Boolah, on the way
to the seaport, in the
opposite direction to the
site of the tragedy, stood
a wayside publichouse,
on the bank of a large
creek, crossed by the road.
Mrs. Brown’s, on Boomer-
ang Creek, was noted east
and west for its neatness,
cleanliness and good accom-
modation. People travel-
ling stretched a
f point to make
the place for the
night’s stay. The
coach -passengers
who grumbled a t
the meagre fare of
the other accommoda-
tion-houses were told to
wait till
they came
to Mrs. Brown’s.
Brown, for there
was a Mr. Brown,
was devoted to out-
door work, but Mrs.
Brown was the presid-
ing genius of comfort indoors, and, therefore, the
place was generally known as “Mrs. Brown’s.”
When the Judge was on circuit, he always care-
fully fell ill for a day or two at Mrs. Brown’s.
Men from the hot western plains, who had lived
for weary months upon pigweed and “ salt-horse,”
rested at Mrs. Brown’s with calm contentment.
Freshest of vegetables, of butter, of eggs, and best
of cooking, what could a man with a salt-junk-
saturated liver want more?
As cheery as her well-kept table was the appear-
ance of the’hostess herself, a plump little woman,
who perennially had a smile upon her pretty face,
and a kindly greeting for everybody. She was
devoted to her quiet, easy-going husband, who
warmly reciprocated the feeling. A word from
Mrs. Brown would steady the most drunken
fellow, and when she was in the bar the language
of all hands was painfully discreet.
It was at this calm haven of rest that Tom
Devine dismounted one evening in his character of
amateur detective. He was, of course, well
known, and Mrs. Brown, as she flitted in and out
of the room seeing after his comfort, kept up a
lively flow of chatter. .
“ I suppose you miss something, Mr. Devine?
she said as she invited him to table.
“ Well, no ! Everything seems as comfortable
as usual, Mrs. Brown.”
“ I’ve lost my dog since you were here last.
You remember little Rattler ? ”
“Of course. WFy, that must be your little
terrier the police have in Boolah,” said Devine 1
with infinite hypocrisy.
Mrs. Brown nodded and smiled brightly. Yes,
I only heard of it the other day. I must send up
and claim him.”
“ How did you lose him ?”
“J am not sure. He was stolen, I believe ; but
we had so many travellers staying here at the
time that I don’t know whom to suspect.”
“Any women amongst them?” asked Devine,
Quickly p - i
“Yes, one. I don’t know who she was; she
was going with her husband to some station out
west.” . .. ,
“ Would you know her again if yon saw her ?”
Mrs. Brown was positive that she would, and in
her turn asked what made Mr. Devine so curious.
“ I will tell you,” he said, after a pause. “ on
have heard all about the murder of Baines, tin
hawker? Well, one of the dogs .was found in a
blacks’ camp, and the gin who had it; asserts that
it was given her by a white woman.”
Mrs. Brown looked down on the table upon which
her hand rested. “1 should be sorry to hear that
she was mixed up in it, for she seemed to be a
very nice person,” she replied.
“But if the gin has told the truth she must
have stolen your dog.”
“ That is true,’ she remarked.
Devine was up at sunrise next morning, after
resthss dreams about a strange woman who went
about stealingdogsand killing hawkers Hestrolled
out and commenced yarning with Brown, who,
bucket in hand, was standing at the milking-yard
waiting for the cows.
“The missus has gone down the paddock for
them this morning,” he confided to Devine ; “ got
up very early—she couldn’t sleep at all last
night.” .
At this moment the first of the lowing herd
made its appearance. Mrs. Brown was behind on
foot, driving them up and leading her horse. One
after the other they blundered over the rails that
had been carelessly let down at one end only.
Mrs. Brown followed, but the horse she was lead-
ing suddenly stopped and refused to step over the
“Confound that horse!” said Brown, “he
wouldn’t lift his legs oVcr a pack-thread if he
could help it.”
Devine did not answer. His thoughts were en-
grossed in a sudden flash of memory. The horse
that obstinately hung back on being required to
step over anything ! The tracks at the wire
fence !
Brown went into the yard and commenced milk-
ing. Mrs. Brown having succeeded in getting her
horse over the rails, went on to the stable, Devine
walking by her side.
“ Mrs. Brown,” he said, quietly. “ / know who
killed Baines, the hawker.”
She started, stopped, and looked him for one
moment in the eyes, read there that he knew the
truth, and turned so deadly white that he
was afraid she would faint. She recovered her-
self, however, and walked steadily on to the
stable. Stopping at the door she glanced around
to see if anybody was wdthin hearing, then said
firmly : “Had I better tell you everything, or go
and give myself up to the police ? ’
“Perhaps you had better tell me,” he replied,
after a pause.
“Very well. I will, presently.”
Mrs. Brown went about her work that morning
apparently unmoved by any unusual emotion. _ It
was not until nearly noon that she found time
and opportunity to see Devine.
Her story, which, for the most part, is un-
fortunately a common one, need not be given in
full. She was an orphan, brought up on a farm
by some distant and not over-kind relatives.
When only an ignorant girl of eighteen, Baines,
who then travelled that district, persuaded her to
elope with him under a promise of marriage that
he never kept. For two years she lived with him
as his wife, until, tired of ill-usage and broken
vows, she ran away and took service as a barmaid
in a country town, where her husband met and
married her.
Fate, unfortunately, brought them to settle
close to the district where Baines was now plying
his trade. The township of Boolah, however, was
his limit, and he had never been to their house
until about a week before his death. Then, on
recognising his former victim, he revengefully
threatened to expose her past life to her husband.
“He was one of those evil-minded men,” she
went on, “who must have something to torture.
It was only out of sheer love of cruelty that he
threatened me, because he saw I was happy with
Brown. He vowed that when he came back from
his trip he would do it, and showed me some old
letters and photographs of mine which would
prove his words. You can fancy my feelings when
he left me with this hanging over my head. My
home to be broken up, and my husband turned
against me ! At times I was tempted to confess
it all to my husband, but then I should have to
admit that I only did it under fear of exposure,
I made up my mind that if I could succeed in
getting the letters and things from Baines, I
would dare him to do his worst, and some days
after he left, I started under the pretence of pay-
ing a visit to a friend in Boolah, with a mad idea
of somehow stealing the letters.
“ I overtook him at the old hut, and intended
to wait in the scrub until he was asleep, but my
little dog, which had followed me, betrayed me
when he caught sight of the other one. They were
twin puppies, and were called ‘Rattler the First ’
and ‘Rattler the Second,’ and when I ran away
from that wretch, I took one with me. I had
nothing for it but to come forward when he recog
nised the dog.
“You may guess what brutal taunts he used
towards me. and when, in despair of getting what
I wanted, I was going away, he tried to stop me
by force. His axe was leaning against the wheel,
and 1 picked it up and dared him to touch me.
He laughed, and the next moment I struck him
down. I scarcely knew I had done it until I saw
him lying there.” She stopped, and, after a
pause, went on.
“ My first thought, of course, was to get away ;
then I remembered my letters. The deed was
done, I might as well get what I came for. I
soon found the letters and things, and left the
spot.”
“And what about the dogs?”
“ They both followed me. About a mile from
the hut some blacks were camped. One gin was
squatting ai the fire, and I called her over and
gave her what I thought was Baines’ dog, thinking
it would get away from them and go back to the
dray in the morning. It was dark, and in my
flurry I made a mistake and gave her mine. When
daylight came I found it out, but I could not
drive the dog away, and it followed me home, for
it remembered me. After hanging about, how-
ever, for a few days it disappeared, and, I sup-
pose, made back to Boolah, where it was found.
Everybody, of co irse, took it for my dog while it
was there.”
“ How did you come to know of the old track ?’
“ I did not know of it. I came on it by chance
in the dark, and my horse followed it. As it was
leading in the right direction I kept on until I
came to the country I knew near Boolah.”
“ And had some difficulty in getting your horse-
over the fence?” said Devine. “Did it not strike
you that giving the dog to the blacks would throw
suspicion on them ? I hope it was not done with
that motive.”
“It was not,” she said, eagerly ; I made sure
that the dog would get away, and I scarcely gave
myself time to think. Afterwards, when it was
too late, what you say occurred to me. Now I
have told you everything. What I did was done
almost in self-defence, and it was only what a
father or a brother would have done for me had I
had one.” .
She ceased and Devine was silent for a while.
At last he spoke.
“ Nobody has any suspicion of this but I.
McFarlane saw the tracks, but I can easily put
him off. The best thing to do is for Brown to-
ride back with me to Boolah and get your dog.


Wolfe’s Schnapps is the greatest tonic and
most beneficial stimulant of the day.
Gladstone Liberals smoke nothing but G N IT N
Darlings.
For my part I shall hold my tongue and advise
you to do the same.”
Now, if the Malingers had not quarrelled
with the Layovahs, Devine and Bell would not
have taken opposite sides in the affair. Devine
would not have constituted himself an amateur
detective, and the matter would have been left to
the proper authorities, who might, possibly, have
blundered on to tlie right culprit. As it is, the
death of Baines, the hawker, has remained a
mystery to all save one woman and one man.
DELCOMYN.
Jonah’s Luck.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Out of luck, mate ? Have a liquor. Hang it!
where’s the use complaining ?
Take your fancy, I’m in funds now, I can stand
the racket, Dan.
Dump your bluey in the corner ; camp here for
the night, it’s raining ;
Bet your life I’m glad to see you—glad to see a
Daylesford man.
Swell? Correct, Dan. Spot the get-up, and I
own this bloomin’ shanty ;
Me the fellows christened “Jonah” at Jim
Crow and Blanket Flat,
Cause my luck was so infernal—you remember me
and Canty ?
Rough times, them—the very mem’ry keeps a
chap from gettin’ fat.
Where’d I strike it ? That’s a yarn. The fire’s a
comfort—sit up nearer.
Hoist your heels, man ; take it easy till Kate’s
ready with the stew.
Yes, I’ll tell my little story; ’taint a long one,
but it’s queerer
Than those lies that Tullock pitched us on The
Flat in ’52.
Fancy Phil a parson now ! He’s smug as grease,
the Reverend Tullock.
Yes, he’s big—his wife and fam’ly are a high
and mighty lob.
Didn’t I say his jaw would keep him when he
✓ tired of punching mullock?
Well, it has—he’s made his pile here. How
d’yer like your whisky—hot ?
Luck ! Well, now, I like your cheek, Dan, You
had luck, there’s no denying.
I in thirty years had av’raged jest a wage of
twenty bob—
Why, at Alma there I saw men making fortunes
without trying,
While for days I lived on ’possums, and then
had to take a job.
Thunder! man, you don’t know bad luck—never
had it thick and thorough :
Gold once ran away before me if I chased it for
a week.
I was starved at Tarrangower—lived on tick at
Mary borough—
And fell and broke my thigh-bone at the start
of Fiery Creek.
At Avoca Canty left me. Jim, you know, was not
a croaker,
But he jacked the whole arrangement—found
we couldn’t make a do.
Said he loved me like a brother, but ’twas rough
upon a joker
When he’d got to fight the devil, and find luck
enough for two.
Jim was off. I didn’t blame him, seeing what
he’d had to suffer,
When Maginnis, jest beside us, panned out fifty
to the tub.
We had pegged out hours before him, and had
struck another duffer,
And, now, every store upon the lead had laid us
up for grub.
After that I picked up Barlow, but we parted at
Dunolly
When we’d struggled through at Alma, Ad’laide
Lead, and Ararat.
See, xny luck was hard agin him ; he contracted
melancholy,
And he hung himself one morning in the shaft
at Parrot Flat.
Ding it ? No. Where gold was getting I was on
the job, and early.
Struck some tucker dirt at Armstrong’s, and just
lived at Pleasant Creek.
Always graftin’ like a good ’un, never hopeless-
like or surly,
Living partly on my earnings, Dan, but largely
on my cheek.
Good old days, they like to call them—they were
tough old days to many.
I was through them, and they left me still the
choice to graft or beg—
Left me grey, and worn, and wrinkled, aged, and
stumped—without a penny—
With a chronic rheumatism and this darned old
twisted leg.
Other work ? That’s true—in plenty.. But you
know the real old stager
Who has followed up the diggings* how he
hangs on to the pan,
How he hates to leave the pipeclay. Tho’ you
mention it I’ll wager
That you never worked on top untilfyou couldn’t
help it, Dan.
years went by. On many fields 1 worked, and
often missed a meal, and
Then Vic. seemed entirely playedl out, and the
yields were very slack,
Bo I took a turn in New South, ami tried Tassy,
and Now Zealand.
Cash ! I worked the journey ower, and;l sneaked
the passage back.
Times were worse. I made a cradle, 4 and went ,
fossicking old places ; 1
But the Chows had been before me.'and had
scraped the country bare.
There was talk of splendid patches ’mongst the
creeks and ’bout the races,
But ’twas not my luck to strike them, and I
think I lived on air.
Rough? That’s not the word. Bo help me, Dan,
I hadn’t got a stiver
When I caved in one fine Sunday—found I
couldn’t lift my head.
They removed me, and the doctor said I’d got
rheumatic fever,
And for seven months I lingered in a ward upon
a bed.
Came out crippled, feeling done-up, hopeless-like
and very lonely,
And dead-beat right down to bed rock as I’d
never felt before.
Bitter? Jest! Those hopeful years of honest
graft had left me only
This bent leg ; and some asylum was the pros-
pect I’d in store,
P’r’aps you know jest how I’d feel then —cleaned-
out, lame, completely gravelled—
All the friends I’d known were scattered widely
north, and east, and west —
There seemed nothing there for my sort, and no
chances if I travelled,
Now my digging days were over, and I had to
give it best.
Tho’ ’twas hard, I tried to meet it like a man in
digger fashion —
’Twasn’t good enough—l funked it ; I was
fairly on the shelf,
Cursed my bitter fortune daily, and was always
in a passion
With the Lord, sir, and with everyone, but
mostly with myself.
I was older twenty years then than I am this
blessed minute,
But I got a job at last there, knapping rock at
Ballarat.

Two-and-three for two-inch metal. ’Course you’ll
say there’s nothing in it,
To the man who’s been through Eaglehawk and
mined at Blanket Flat.
Wait, you’d better let me finish : Weak and ill,
I bucked in gladly,
But to get the tools I needed I was forced to
pawn my swag.
Now I had no thought of patches, but I needed
■ tucker badly,
And this job, I think, jest saved me being
lumbered on the vag.
Fortune is a fickle party, but in spite of all her
failings,
Don’t revile her, Dan, as I did, while you’ve
still a little rope.
Well, the heap that I was put on was some heavy
quartz and tailings,
That was carted from a local mine, perhaps the
Band of Hope.
Take the lesson that is coming to your heart, old
man, and hug it
Tight. I started on the heap with scarce a soul
to call my own,
And in less than twenty minutes I’d raked out a
bouncing nugget
Scaling close on ninety ounces, and just frosted
round with stone.
How is that for high, my hearty ? Miracle ! It
was, by thunder!
After forty years of following the rushes up and
down,
‘Getting old, and past all prospect, and about to

Struck it, lucky knapping metal in the middle of

JPass the bottle ! Have another ! Soon we’ll get

But my pile was made beforehand—made it

That’s the yarn I pitch the neighbours. Here’s

EDWARD DYSON.
FINIS!
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He was the life of the hut. Good-looking, jolly,
and devil-may-care ; singing a good song, telling a
good story, and tremendously given to blow about
his exploits amongst the girls. Just the sort of
fellow to take an ordinary woman’s fancy, he was,
too. Crisp brown hair, twinkling blue eyes, curly
yellow beard, no brains to speak of, and the self-
confidence of the Devil himself. This particular
evening he was in great form. Sunday it was,
and we had all been drinking, but the rest of us
had no chance to talk much. Jordan —Jim Jordan
was his name—did all that for us ; and, as usual,
his subject was himself —and the women !
“ And didn’t ye never feel sorry for any of thim
hearts ye say ye broke ?”
We all stared, for the question came from old
Tim, a man who didn’t open his mouth once a
month, unless somebody spoke to him first. Tim
was a curious fish, and no mistake. Tall and
big-framed and lean, with a short, grizzled
beard, and rather kindly-looking eyes under
a pair of eyebrows that would have made a
decent pair of moustaches. Nobody knew his
other name, and most of us thought there was
some mystery about the old chap, but, as he did
his full share of work and minded his own busi-
ness, we never troubled to fit him with a history.
Still, we were rather surprised when we heard his
voice from the background.
“Don’t ye niver feel sorry?” he repeated, for
Jordan looked a bit disconcerted, and wasn’t
quite so pat with his answer as usual.
He took a mouthful of rum - and - water.
“ Hullo, old Stick-in-the-Mud !” he said then.
“Found your tongue at last, have you? Sorry?
No—devil a bit! Why should Ibe ? If the silly
little animals choose to go crazy about me, that’s
no fault of mine. It was to be, I suppose. It’s
all life, you know; all life, and there’s an end of
it!” And then he laughed, and drank again.
But the old man’s question had told upon him,
we could see, for, when he had lighted his pipe,
he went on in less rollicking tones.
“There’s one affair I do feel a bit sorry for, at
times. Only when I’m out of sorts, though.”
He puffed hard at his clay, and I waited for
more —sure that the man’s vanity would be too
strong for any temporary regrets he might feel.
“It was a girl down at Kokallin,” went on
Jordan, presently. “Leastways, it was a
married woman, but only a girl in years. She
was tied to a man old enough to be her father,
so it was natural enough she should t ike up with
me. Poor Liz. ! She was fond of me, and no
mistake !”
Old Tim got hastily up and went to the door
then came back as suddenly and plumped down on
his seat again. “ Thought I hoard rain !” he said,
seeing us all staring at him.
“Trifle off your dot, old chap!" commented
Jordan. “I’m thinking you must have murdered
somebody in your time ! ”
But Tim only glared at him over the bowl of his
pipe, and Jordan went on :
“Very fond of me, was Liz; fonder than any
of the others —and, of course, it was all honey
while it lasted.”
“ How did the old man like it ? ” I asked.
“The husband? Oh, he never knew anything
about it. Not then, at anyrate. Fact is, I never
set eyes on him. He used to travel about a good
bit, cattle-dealing, and Liz took precious good
care that he was out of the way before she’d let
me come near the place. But it couldn’t go on for
ever, and the devil of it came when she wanted mo
to make a bolt of it with her. Of course that
wouldn’t wash, and so I told her.”
“ How did she take it ? ” I asked, for the brutal
and naked selfishness of the man began to interest
me in spite of myself. It dawned upon me sud-
denly that, despite all his taking ways and hand-
some outside, he was simply a beast of prey-
nothing more !
“ Oh, the usual thing ! Prayers and tears and
despair, and all that ! Couldn’t live without me,
and so forth. Bless you ! it’s what they all say.
So, like a wise man, I just cleared out and got
away from her. And there’s an end of it.”
“ Was that the end of it?” said Old Tim, rising
suddenly to his feet and pointing his pipe-stem,
with a naturally dramatic gesture, straight at the
narrator.
Jordan flinched as if the stumpy briar had been
a revolver. “Sit down, you old fool!” he said
angrily, “ and don’t stand there glowering like a
mopoke! I don’t see what the devil it’s got
to do with you; but I may as well tell these
chaps the finish. She—well, I believe she drowned
herself ! But, enough of this ! That bloomin’
old scarecrow has given me the creeps. I’ll go
and have a smoke outside before I turn in.”
He emptied his pannikin, filled his pipe again,
and went out. Tim followed him, and I followed
Tim, for I was certain there was tragedy in the
air. There was a faint moonlight, and as I got to
the hut-door I could see Jordan standing on the
bank of the creek with his back towards me. He
turned as he heard Tim’s step behind him, and for
a full half-minute the two looked each other in the
face before Jordan spoke. Spoke more quietly
than I expected ; but his voice had changed—it
had a note of uneasiness in it now.
“ Well, old Fly-by-Night! Come to ask more
questions, eh ? Seem to take quite an interest
in my little yarn. You’re not such a cursed old
mummy as you look, after all! Been a demon
amongst the women yourself, I shouldn’t wonder,
some time or other !”
“ I just—wanted—to ask ye—one more ques-
tion,” said Tim, dragging the words out as if they
choked him. “ What might have been —her other
name—that Liz. ye spoke of to-night?”
“ Her name ? What’s her name to do with
you? However, since you want to know, her
name was Barker —Mrs. Barker. What an awful
old fool you must be to bother your brains about a
dead woman ! There’s nothing in it —it’s all life,
you know.”
“ Life!” repeated the other, with a savage laugh.
“ No, you dog ! —it’s death this time !”—and,
closing suddenly with Jordan, over they both
went, slap into the creek.
I yelled out, and the rest came running from
the hut. But we could do nothing. The bank
was like the side of a house, and the rain-swollen
creek ran swift and strong. Once, fifty yards
down, there came a slight splashing, and then
again the silence of the night, seeming doubly
deep and awful as we gazed in each other’s dazed
faces. Jordan could swim, we knew, but we also
knew, now that the truth was out, that there
wasn’t much likelihood of his getting the chance.
And so it proved. They were found stranded in a
bend at Terramundah, eight miles further down,
and there had clearly been no swimming, for Tim’s
hands were still fast upon Jordan’s neck with a
grip that would have strangled him or any other
man —in the water or out of it.
RINGTAIL.
Kohnke’s Christmas.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was Christmas Eve. The rain was fall-
ing in torrents, and Kohnke was on thorns, lest
his water race should be washed away. The wind
was blowing with continuous fury, and chain and
forked lightning were somewhat of a novelty to us
in Maoriland.
At six o’clock in the evening, Kohnke could
bear it no longer. Taking a lantern, he resolved
to brave the storm, and open every by-wash along
the race. He left his wife and children at table,
and sallied forth.
# # #
The race wound round a rocky hill.
It consisted of fluming, tunnel, and open
ditching. Kohnke must have been to the
very end of the race, for the connection
with the creek was shut off. On his re-
turn he saw by the light of the lantern, at a place
where the track passed just below the flume, one
of the boxes beginning to yield. Had a friendly
flash of lightning at that supreme moment revealed
the nature of the disaster, it might have saved
his life. As it was, he only saw the box
going, and the doomed wretch strove to hold it.
In the darkness of that awful night, the hill
gathered itself together, and slipped down into
the creek. Kohnke clung to the box. Amid the
howling of the wind, and the roar of the thunder,
and the driving rain, we in the camp heard a
fearful tumult.
* # #
Hours passed. Kohnke did not return.
All night it rained. All night the wretched wife
knelt by the bed. At day-break we started off,
and soon arrived at the scene of the land-slide.
* * *
Kohnke had been about the centre. Far
down, a tree-trunk stretched athwart the gully,
forming an arch. Tons of dirt went underneath.
The space filled. Kohnke, uninjured, was passing
over the beam when the box came and pinned his
legs against the tree. Tons of dirt were pressing
on the box. Thus pinned, he had dangled all
night. He had been alive. The creek rose higher
and higher, and about midnight he must have been
drowned. He had worn all the skin from his
arms in a mad attempt to hold his head out.
Who dare say Kohnke did not have a happy
Christmas ?

Blood for Blood.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Silence everywhere, the spell of heat on every-
thing. Kites, which have been soaring on strong
pinions away back in the dry country, swooping
down on the grasshoppers, have had to come in to
this lonely waterhole tired out and wearied ; and
now sit dozing on the branches of the motionless
coolibah. One who has left it too long has had
only sufficient strength to reach the water and
flounder in, and stands with bedraggled feathers
.moping at the edge of the muddy pool, There is
no animal nor human life to be seen—just a round
clay hole, a few withered polygonum bushes, and
some gnarled and warped coolibah trees.
Aroufid ! a bare plain with a bewildering heat-
mist hovering over it.
The slow, hot hours creep on. The sodden kite
standing near the water suddenly topples over and
falls dead ; at times one of the others flops heavily
down from its perch, takes a few sips and flies
back again. These are the only sounds, the only
living movements that break the stagnant mono-
tony.
There is neither track of man nor beast to be
seen, but for all that what was once a man is lying
there beneath one of the shadeless trees. It has
been lying there for over six months, so there is
nothing very repulsive about the poor corpse
but its shrivelled likeness to humanity. When
it staggered in there alive the hole was
dry, and it sank down and died. Since
then a quick, angry thunderstorm has passed
and partly filled the hole, too late. But no prowling
dog has found the body, not even the venturesome
crow has been to inspect it; the desert has pro-
tected it from white tooth and black beak, and it
lies there, dry and withered, but the form of a
man—and a white man, still.
This is the story of that unburied, unwept, un-
tended corse. It is a story of thirst, of treachery,
of revenge.
Years ago, when stations were valuable and all
things pastoral looked bright ahead, three men
pushed out beyond the bounds of settlement in
search of new country. Two of them were fast
friends, although there was considerable difference
in their ages. The third was simply on the footing
of ordinary friendship and of about the same age
as the elder of the other two. The party was
completed by a black boy.
Far beyond the lonely water-hole where the
wearied kites sit watching the silent dead, they
came on to good country—fair, rolling downs and
deep permanent holes. At one of these they fixed
a camp and inspected the country on all sides with
a view of dividing the runs fairly. One day the
younger of the two friends and the third man
went out together. They took a long excursion
northward, and .finding no water made, the next
day, for a small hole they had passed on their way
out. Fatal mistake—the hole was dry, with the body
of a misled dingo rotting in the bottom, and with
thirsty, tired horses and nearly empty bags they
were now forty miles from their camp, the nearest
water.
They turned out for a short spell and lay down
to catch a few moments of slumber. The young
man slept soundly, dreaming of long, cool swims
in the river ; of watching it sparkling and leaping
amongst the rocks; then he awoke suddenly to
find himself companionless in the desert He
raised himself on his elbow and looked around.
The clear starlight showed him nothing; he was
actually alone; his mate and all the horses
were gone. He went to where they had hung
their water-bags on a tree. They were gone, too.
He comprehended it all. His treacherous friend
had taken the two freshest horses and the remnant
of the water and started for the camp, trusting
that one would get in where two could not. The
other two horses had probably followed of their
own accord, to die in their tracks.
He had no hope that his companion meant to
come' back with succour. A man who could do
such a deed would never suffer his victim to bear
witness against him. He had the choice of two
deaths—a lingering one where he was, or a quicker
one in a desperate attempt to gain the camp. He
chose the latter. He had no expectation that his
own old friend would come to his relief, for he
guessed he would be deceived by some specious lie.
When the end came, as it soon did, and he fell
for the last time, he prayed with his dying breath
that the man who had wrought his death might
die as he did.
Late that night the survivor, with one remain-
ing horse, reached the camp, and told the anxious
occupant how his friend had died of thirst; how
lie had helped him on to the last, and only
jeft his body when aid was useless and his own
jife in jeopardy. “ I must start at daylight and
bring his body in if possible;” was the answer at
last. Then one lay down to sleep the sleep of
exhaustion, the other to watch and mourn.
Over-tired men seldom sleep soundly. Some
rambling words from the haunted sleeper roused
the watcher’s attention. He listened, as the
dreamer restlessly babbled out his secret. Ho
understood it all, and for an instant his hand was
on his revolver; but no. Ho would have proof,
and then
Next morning, with the black boy, he was on
his way before the stars were paling. Proof was
easily forthcoming by the tracks. The body of
his young friend lay by itself on the plain; no
horse-tracks led to it, none from it. He had died
by himself, and the story of staying with him to i
the last was false. What use in following the
trail back further? He returned to camp with i
a calm face, but with vengeance in his heart. 5
It was easily done. The other suspected nothing- 1
One morning the two rode out together for a last
look to the southward before returning. Twenty
miles from camp they stopped at a scanty belt of
timber; beyond was nothing but a boundless
plain.
“Get up one of the trees,” said the avenger,
“ you may be able to see a little better from that
elevation.”
The other dismounted and complied. He stood
on the highest limb, no great height, and looked
all around; nothing visible but the blue mirage.
He looked below. His companion was a hundred
yards, or more, away leading his horse. He
stopped for an instant and turned in his saddle,
and the words smote on the listener’s ear hotter
than the blazing sunbeams : “As you served that
poor murdered boy, so I serve you. If by any
miracle you survive and I hear of you again
amongst men I will take your life wherever I find
you.” Then he turned and rode away deaf to
calls and entreaties.
Stumbling over the plain, now cursing in impo-
tent rage, now begging and praying for mercy the
guilty man followed the silent figure leading the
horse. Followed it until his sweat-blinded eyes
could see no longer, and the poor, abandoned
wretch felt the lonely horror of the desert encircle
him, for he knew he should never see the face of
his fellow man again.
He reached the camp during the night. It was
deserted. The threat was carried out to the
letter. Aye more, for a ghost sate there by the
dead embers, that he only could see, but it drove
him forth into the night, and with desperate,
hopeless purpose he made for the haunts of men.
Who knows what he suffered before his dying

take me to them,” she pleaded, pulling his hand.
He yielded, and they went down the street.
“What the am I to do with the kid?”
growled he, as they walked.
Beauty’s steps grew heavier and heavier till
at last she stopped, and said :
“ I’se so tired. Carry me, please.”
“ Carry you ! Well, I’m damned ! ”
“ Mammie always carries me. I won’t be heavy.”
Then he lifted her up, till her soft hair brushed
past his cheek and the little head closed on his
shoulder. Then she started coughing.
“ What’s up, now ? ”
“ Dat nasty smoke ! Take it away!” and he
put his pipe in his pocket.
They came to a public garden, and as she gave
no sign of wakefulness, he sat down on the first
seat, to think.
He knew he ought to give her up to the first
constable he met. But, then, he did not
meet one, and he didn’t want to. He
might have left her in the street —he could
do so now. But he knew the city too well
to leave a young child alone in it, and he felt he had
a right to protect her. Besides, the feeling of the
child’s regular breathing in his arms was so novel
and pleasant a sensation that he did not like to
end it, or even think of ending it. So he waited.
With one hand he managed to get at his pipe, and
sucked at it without lighting it for fear of waking
Beauty. He began to doze, too, till he was
roused by the creaking of the turnstile at the end
of the avenue. Ah! he knew those slow, measured
footsteps. A helmeted shadow appeared in the
moonlight and bore down towards him.
“Halloa!” it said. “What are yez doin’
there ?”
“Trying to doss. My kid’s tired, and we’ve
got nowhere else,” replied the Beast, speaking
very low.
“Oh, Oi’ll soon see about that,” said the police-
man, turning his lantern on the pair.
“ Oh, keep that infernal light off her face!” said
the Beast, shielding Beauty’s eyes with his hand.
“Oho! so it’s you, Jim,” recognising him,
“ye’re wanted, me malm. What are viz doin’
with that gurrel? ”
“ I found her. She was lost. Can’t you speak
quiet! You’ll wake her.”
“Oh, ye found her, did ye? Loike enough,
Come along,” and he gave the Beast a tug at the
collar to help him.
The j c rk awakened Beauty. She screamed.
“ Curse you ! ” said the Beast.
“ All right, me little dear, don’t be afraid.” She
cried and clung to the Beast’s shoulders.
“Give her to me,” said the constable.
“ I3e hanged !”
“ None of your nonsense, Jim, it’ll only be the
wurse for yiz,” and he pulled the child out of
Jim’s arms.
“Damn yer ! Leave her alone.”
“ Come along, now--think yerself lucky if ye
don’t get charged with kidnapping.”
The Beast’s blood was up now and he gave the
policeman one between the eyes. Then they
scuffled, while Beauty looked on.
As the policeman was the stronger he soon had
“ the darbies ” on Jim.
And when the case came before the court the
Beast got three months for assaulting the police.
This was in addition to another sentence.
He spent the time cursing himself for having
been such a fool as to notice that “ blessed kid.”
“ Please, Mister, I’se lost!”
The Beast looked down as he heard this, and a
little hand crept into his, and a little tear-stained
face looked up from the pavement.
It was Beauty’s.
He had been watching the painted shadows of
the city rustling past him, and even his eyes could
see the difference. He felt puzzled. Beauty’s
fingers clasped his so tightly, and yet, for various
reasons, he wished to avoid notoriety. He had
just done six months, and therefore felt entitled
to a holiday. There were various accounts out-
standing between him and the police, and he had
no desire for settlement just yet.
“ Take me home, please.”
“ Where d'ye doss?” he asked.
The child’s eyes wondered.
“ Where d’ye live, then ?”
“At home, with mamma and auntie. Please

In perfume from my blushing roses.”
Bracelet said : ‘‘ My rubies red,

Beauty mused awhile, and said

In winter they will buy me roses.”
THE PASSION FLOWER.
’Tis said that the Passion Flower,
With its figures of spear, and sword,
And hammer, and nails, is a symbol
Of the Woe of our Blessed Lord.
So still in the Heart of Beauty
Has been hidden, since Life drew breath,
The sword and the spear of Anguish,
And the hammer and nails of Death.
A SONG OF ROVING.
When the sap runs up the tree,
And the vine runs o’er the wall,
When the blossom draws the bee,
From the forest comes a call,
Wild, and clear, and sweet, and strange,
Many-toned and murmuring
Like the river in the range—
’Tis the joyous voice of Spring !
0 rise up, rise up, light-hearted,
And take your staff in hand,
For it is the time for roving
Through the green and pleasant land.
On the boles of grey old trees
Lo, the flying sunbeams play
Mystic, soundless melodies—
A fantastic march and gay—
But the young leaves hear them—hark,
How they rustle, ev’ry one !
And the sap beneath the bark
Hearing, leaps to meet the sun.
Then arise, arise, and follow ;
The music goes before.
For it is the time for roving, \
Though we should return no more.
0, the world is wondrous fair
When the tide of Life’s at flood !
There is magic in the air,
There is music in the blood,
And a glamour draws us on
To the Distance, rainbow-spanned,
And the road we tread upon
Is the road to Fairyland,
So arise, arise, companions,
As quickly as you may,
For it is the time for roving
O’er the hills and far away !
Lo, the elders hear the sweet
Voice, and know the wondrous song ;
And their ancient pulses beat
To a tune forgotten long ;
And they talk in whispers low,
With a smile, and with a sigh,
Of the years of long ago,
And the roving days gone by,
Then arise, arise, so gaily,
While brightly shines the sun !
For we’ll go no more a-roving
When the roving days are done,
“GNOTHI SEAUTON.”
Upon a time long past there lived a sage
Who said the core of Wisdom might be found
In these words, “ Know Thyself.” For many
an age
Men praised his apophthegm and called it
sound.
But those who took the words too much to
heart,
And made of Self-Analysis a craze
(If Duty in their Creeds had any part),
Praised it no more ; not having breath for
praise.
For, when they had found out the kind of men
They really were, they lost all thoughts of
mirth,
And went and hanged themselves, right there
and then,
Or otherwise evanished from the earth.
A sample, this, of how the odds and ends
Of Ancient Clap-trap now for Wisdom

The Conquest of "Barkinses."
( FOR THE BULLETIN. )
When Mr. John Wisken, after due con-
sideration, decided upon entering the service of
the Department of Public Instruction of New
South Wales, he was not fully aware of the mag-
nitude of the troubles that such a course would
involve. Mr. Wisken’s knowledge of back-blocks
peculiarities in manners and customs was purely
theoretical, and his lively imagination conjured up
a picture of the homely joys which he believed to
be the accompaniments of rural life that was quite
charming. He was a well-meaning youth, and it
is, therefore, a pity that his first experience of
Australian bush life did not realise at least some
of his expectations. But it was Wisken’s fate to
learn his first lesson in bush manners at “Bar-
kinses.” And “Barkinses” —as Mr. Wisken
afterwards fully admitted—was “ a corker.”
This was the way of it. Wisken had come out
from “ home.” He spent all his money, and then
bis remittances ceased with painful abruptness.
For a few months he lived on the remembrance of
his former glory, but that faded at last. Then
someone advised him to go into the bush as a
school-teacher. “ It’ll be better than the Domain,
anyhow, ’ Wisken reflected, and accordingly went
through the necessary preliminaries. Some time
after he had signified his desire to serve his
country as an instructor of its youth, he received
a big letter stating that some gentleman whose
name Wisken could not read had been directed by
the Minister of Public Instruction to request
that Mr. Wisken would proceed at once
to Barkins’ Creek, near Bogalong, for the
purpose of acting as teacher, of the public
school thereat, pending the consideration of his
appointment, by authority, to that office; that
salary would be paid to him at the rate of £!J(j per
annum from the date of
his entrance on duty;
that the Barkins’ Creek
School was under the
supervision of Mr. In-
spector Hoskins, with
whom Mr. Wisken should
communicate regarding
all matters connected
with the school under
his charge ; and that the
gentleman who signed
the letter had the honour
to be Mr. Wisken’s most
obedient servant.
So Wisken borrowed
some money, and went to
Bogalong, and inter-
viewed Mr. Inspector
Hoskins, with a view to
obtaining information
regarding Barkins’ Creek
and its inhabitants.
“Going to Barkins’
Creek, eh ! ” said Mr.
Hoskins. “ Pretty rough
shop, Barkinses.”
“How far is it, sir?
and how am I to get
there?” inquired Mr.
Wisken.
“It’s about thirty-
seven miles from here,”
said Mr. Hoskins, cheer-
fully. “ How’ll you get
there? Well, I suppose
you’ll have to take the
pony for it.”
“ The pony ! Which
“ Shanks’, you know.
There’s no other way,” explained Mr. Hoskins.
“ You can do it in two days, easily.”
Mr. Wisken smothered a sigh, and inquired if
there was “any good place to stay at on Barkins’
Creek ?”
“ Well, it’s hardly what one would call a good
place. You see,” Mr. Hoskins explained, “there’s
only one family there that’ll take a boarder—old
Barkins’, the place was named after him—and
he’s rather a rough diamond. Miss Jones, your
predecessor, didn't get on well with Barkins at
all.”
“No?”
“No. She said she never got anything to eat
except goat and pork, and that Barkins fed his
pigs on ’possums.
“ And she didn’t like the flavour ? ”
“ No. And then she didn’t like her bed-room
having no door, but only a kind of reredos arrange-
ment, made of a flour-bag cut endwise.”
“ Um —some young ladies Mwnh/objeotto that.”
“ Yes. Then she said she had to sleep on a
bark-stretcher, without sheets. And the rain
came through the roof and made the floor muddy>
so that she used to get bogged.”
“But, Mr. Hoskins, you can’t expect every
comfort in the bush. If you get among nice
kindly people, you know, you can put up with
little inconveniences.”
“ That’s just it. Miss Jones said that Mr. and
Mrs. Barkins were not nice people. She said that
Mrs. Barkins was very jealous, and that she
threw a dish of pig’s food over Miss Jones because
of that.”
“Was Miss Jones very friendly with Mr.
Barkins, then ? ”
“ She says not. In fact, she took quite a dis-
like to him after a breach of good manners he was
guilty of in her presence.”
“ What was that ? ”
“ Well, you see, Miss Jones and all the Barkins
family were sitting round the table after supper,
and Miss Jones was reading. The table wasn’t
cleared they never altogether cleared it at
Barkins’, Miss Jones says—and old Barkins put
his bare feet on the table. Miss Jones says she
always thought, after this, that Mr. Barkins was
no gentleman. But I mustn’t detain you, Mr.
Wisken. Get out to Barkinses and begin work as
soon as you can. I’ll be out to examine in a month
or two. Good morning.”
* # *
Wisken’s predecessor, Miss Jones, had
stayed at Barkinses for four months. Four days
sufficed Wisken. From the very outset, he met
with discouragement. On the second day after
leaving Bogalong he arrived at a long, straggling
bark residence, placed in the midst of a treeless
waste with an outcrop of nubbly rocks, amid
which a herd of lean goats wandered. There was
no fence, and the entrance to the mansion was
obstructed by the household-brigade portion of
the goats, some ducks, and a detachment of pigs,
which were listlessly rooting into the ash-heap.
Just behind the ash-heap Wisken saw an athletic
woman dragging a struggling goat along by the
hind legs. As he approached, the woman looked
up with a gratified expression, and said :
“Come and gimme a hand with this here goat.
Just sit on him while I cut his throat. You’re the
noo schoolmaster, I s’pose ?”
Wisken, regardless of his new pants, rendered
the assistance required, and while the unhappy
goat slowly died from haemorrhage, the lady
wiped her knife on its hide and continued :
“I don’t think you can stop at our place. The
old man’s been on the booze for the last three
weeks, and he won’t let anyone inside the house.
Exceptin’ me.” (This with modest pride.) “He
can’t ” —sticking the still ensanguined knife into
the ground—“ keep me out. He druv out the two
boys yesterday, though, an’ Sal., with a gun.
Bub 1 think he’ll sober up now, because all the
grog’s done, an’ I’ve copped all his money. Get
up now an’ I’ll whip this feller's hide off.”
After the deceased quadruped had been hayed
and hung up, Wisken arranged with Mrs. Barkins
PLAIN WORDS FROM THE BENCH.
HIS WORSHIP (to prisoner): “Obscane langwidge av all langwidges is the langwidge above all landwidge that the law must put its
fut down upon wid a firrum hand. Six months!”
that he should become an inmate of the Barkins
household, provided the consent of Mr. Barkins
could be obtained when he “sobered up,” and
providing, also, that his active resistance to Mr-
Wisken did not upset the arrangement in the
meantime. Then the new-comer timidly entered
the abode of Mr. Barkins (the owner was, for-
tunately, asleep), and after partaking of a meal of
fried goat and damper served by the fair hands of
Mrs. Barkins, retired to rest.
The next day was an eventful one to Mr.
Wisken. When he emerged in the morning, he
encountered a tall man, with black whiskers and
bloodshot eyes, who asked Wisken who the
Gehenna he was, and what the blazing lower
regions he was staring at. And, when Wisken
replied in the most conciliatory manner, the tall
man swore several times and threw a bottle at
him. Wisken shortly afterwards went outside,
because he thought a walk in the fresh air would
do him good, and because Mr. Barkins was
tremulously trying to load a gun, and Wisken did
not want to bo in his way. So he did not wait for
breakfast, but began a tour of the neighbourhood
at once. He visited the homes of all the leading
residents of Barkinses, and announced his inten-
tion of setting the local educational machine at
work on the morrow. He endeavoured to persuade
some of the inhabitants to accommodate him with
lodgings, as he was beginning to think
that living in the same house as Mr. Barkins
might prove to have its disadvantages, but was
unsuccessful. And, indeed, had the folks been
ever so willing, it was plainly impossible to find
room for a lodger in a bark humpy consisting of
two rooms, such as was occupied by most of the
people of Barkinses. “No,” they said, “teachers
at Barkinses boards with Barkinses. They get a
whole bedroom to themselves there, and what more
can they want ? ”
When Wisken returned to Barkins’ roof-tres
that evening, he found that the banished membere
of the family had returned. He was first made
aware of this fact by meeting two long-legged
youths near his lodgings who, as he surmised,
were Mr. Barkins’ sons. They advanced towards
Wisken in a hostile manner, and the longer-legged
of the two at once requested of Wisken that he
would put up his (adjective) props. Before Wisken
could reply, the other youth struck him so
violently on the chin that Wisken fell down,
whereupon the youth informed him that
that would teach him to knock the youth’s old
man about when he was too “ tanked up ” to take
his own part. Wisken now perceived that the
youths were under a misconception, and, after a
deal of trouble, he managed to persuade them that
he had not been guilty of an assault on Mr.
Barkins, senr., whereupon they allowed Wisken
to rise and shake hands with them, and they
entered the house together in amity.
But Mr. Barkinf, senr., was still in an un-
friendly mood. He' was irritable, too, owing to
his recent indisposition, and announced that it
was his deliberate intention to make things very
unsettled for Wisken. So, when that unlucky
youth entered, Barkins directed him to “get out of
that d d quick,” and followed up his command
by whistling for his dogs. Under the auspices of
these bloodthirsty animals, Wisken made his
exit with great promptitude and despatch, and
with a full determination never more to brighten
Barkins’ threshold with his presence. He had
eaten nothing all day, and now made for the
school, where, with the aid of some tea and sugar
and sour bread he had borrowed from one of
Barkins’ neighbours, he prepared a frugal repast,
and then went to sleep on the floor, weary and
worn and sad, and fairly brimming over with
profanity.
In the morning he felt much the same, only
more so. And when, about nine a.m., a score of
wou l d-be students arrived, and Wisken saw among
the baro-footed, tangle-headed crowds of youths
and maidens the two gaunt persons who had
assailed him on the previous day, and heard them
relate, in the most humorous manner, how “ the
master ” had been chased by their old man;
Wisken felt altogether too broken-up to proceed
with his educational duties. He briefly announced
that there would be no school that day, and dis-
missed the whole crowd. When the last one had
disappeared into the depths of the surrounding
bush, Wisken gloomily departed and never came
back.
* * *
Now, Inspector Hoskins is a man of
wisdom. And when he was asked to nominate
a successor to Wisken, resigned, he proved it.
Brown is the name of the man he sent, and
Brown has now been stationed at Barkinses for
two years. He is very highly thought of by the
populace, and last week they gave a “darnce”
entirely in his honour. He boards at Barkins’,
but the head of that family no longer graces the
festive board with his presence—or his feet. For
Brown had studied ear-marks in his youth,
and when Barkins behaved uncivilly to him,
Brown applied his knowledge, with special
reference to Barkins’ sheep, and the result
was that Mr. Barkins was found to have quite
a mixed lot, and he got five years’ hard labour on
account of this. Of course, Brown means to get a
remove before Barkins comes out, but, in the
meantime, he is very comfortable where he is.
The visionary ideas of the two youths were soon
disposed of by Brown. The elder youth lasted
five rounds, but the younger was knocked out in
the very first per medium of the round-arm swing
invented by Mr. La Blanche, the Marine. And
now Brown makes them catch his horse and clean
his boots and bring a hot dinner to school for him
daily, and grow potatoes and other luxuries for
his exclusive use, besides cultivating a herd of
poultry.

Inspector Hoskins says, vide last Education
Report:—
“ Some difficulty has been experienced in getting
teachers to accept appointments in remote and
sparsely populated localities ; but the discomforts
and inconveniences of such have been greatly
exaggerated, and are always to be overcome by
persons possessed of tact and energy.”

A Quiet Departure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So far they had been very happy. His dinner
was not always ready, but the girl was invariably
at home to welcome him with kisses that brought
the blood into his big restless eyes. If perchance
he returned earlier than usual to find nothing
done, she would tease him, saying, “ A gentleman
friend of mine called, dear,” and he laughed
pleasantly at her little jest —for twelve months.
Then he thought, thought at night and thought
ail day (it is really only madmen who can think so
industriously), and one day he went home and
she kissed him and joked him more merrily than
usual.
It was an unconventional sight. The man
resting his weary limbs in a large wicker fo’ding
chair calmly smoking his pipe, spitting every now
and again, sometimes on the carpet, sometimes on
the corpse. Oh, yes; the corpse was just about
a yard from where he sat, the feet nearest to him
and the dainty, yellow head turned a trifle askew
by a sudden contact with the door as it fell. The
body of a woman very young, very plump, very
dead.
Raising bis eyebrows in gentle perplexity, the
man thought aloud :
“ Let me see, I suppose I’d better bury her
to-night;' then, after a long pause and many
sucks at his pipe, “yes, Frisco I think, it’s
a long while since I was in California, must
be 15 years. Dear, dear, I’m getting old.” He
turned in his chair and
yawned.
Caught ? Oh, no. The
landlord called for bis
rent two or three times,
and no one seemed to be
in. At last he broke
open the door.
“Funny!” he said,
when he found the house
full of furniture and no
one about. Walking
through to the little back-
yard, he found that his
tenants had kept their
one solitary bed of
flowers (only nine feet
by four) in good order.
The blood-red geraniums
promised to be trees ere
long. A sale of the
furniture yielded con-
siderably more than the
rent due, and the land-
lord accepted the loss of
his tenants with resigna-
tion.
“Of course, they were
not married,” said the
neighbours, “ so, when
her people heard of it,
they went quietly
away. ”
Quite true, neighbours,
quite true, very quietly.
But not together. The
one was taken and the
other left.

refreshing and agreeable of balms for the skin.”

The God-Forgotten Election.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Pat M‘Durmer brought the tidings to the town
God-Forgotten :
“ There are lively days before ye—comrnin
Parlymint’s dissolved ! ”
And the boys were all excited for the State, of
course, was “rotten,”
And, in _ subsequent elections, God-Forgotten
was involved.
I here was little there to live for save in drinking
beer and eating,
But we rose on this occasion ere the news
appeared in print,
Jor the boys of God-Forgotten, at a wild, up-
roarious meeting,
Nominated Billy Blazes for the “ comrnin Parly-
mint.”
Other towns had other favourites, but the day
before the battle
Bushmen flocked to God-Forgotten, and the
distant sheds were still;
Sheep were left to go to glory, and neglected mobs
Of cattle
Went a-straying down the river ac their sweet
bucolic will.
William Spouter stood for Freetrado (and his
votes were split by Nottin),
He had influence behind him, and he also had
the tin,
But across the lonely flatlands came the cry of
God-Forgotten,
“Vote for Blazes and Protection, and the land
you’re living in !”
Pat M‘Durmer said, “Ye soheemers, please to
shut ye’re ugly faces,
Lend ye’re dirty ears a momint while I give ye
all a hint :
Keep ye sober till to-morrow and record ver vote for
Blazes
If ye want to send a ringer to the comrnin
Parlymint.
As a young and growin’ township God-For-
gotten’s been neglected,
And if we’d be represinted, now’s the moment
to begin—
Have the local towns encouraged, local industries
purtected ;
Vote for Blazes and Protection and the land
ye’re living in.
“J don’t say that William Blazes is a purfect
out-an’-outer,
I don’t say he have the learning, for he never
had the luck ;
I don’t say he have the logic, or the gift of gab,
like Spouter,
I don’t say he have the practice — but I say he
HAVE THE PLUCK !
“ Now the country’s gone to ruin and the Govern-
ments are rotten,
But he’ll save the public credit and purtect the
public tin,
To the iverlasting glory of the name of God-For-
gotten
Vote for Blazes and Protection and the land ye’re
living in !”
Pat M‘D, went on the war-path, and he worked
like salts and senna,
For he organized committees full of energy and
push;
And those wild committees riding through the
whisky-fed Gehenna
Routed out astonished voters from their
humpies in the bush.
Every thing on wheels was “rinted,” and half-
sobered drunks were shot in ;
Said M‘Dimmer to the driver, “If ye want to
save ye’re skin,
Never stop to wet yer whistles—drive like h—l
to God-Forgotten,
Make the villains plump for Blazes, and the
land they’re living in.”
Late sojourners in the graveyard (for the purpose
resurrected)
Plumped for Blazes and Protection, and the
country where they died ;
So he topped the poll by sixty, and when Blazes
was elected
There was victory and triumph on the God-
Forgotten side.
Then the boys got up a banquet and our chair-
man, Pat M‘Durmer,
Was next day discovered sleeping in the local
baker’s bin—
All the dough had risen round him, but we heard
a smothered murmur,
“ Vote for Blazes and Protection, and the land
ye’re livin’ in.”
Now the great Sir William Blazes lives in
London ’cross the waters,
And they say his city mansion is the swellest in
West End,
But I very often wonder if his toney sons and
daughters
Ever heard of Billy Blazes who was once the
“ people’s friend ?”
Does his biassed mem’ry linger round that wild
electioneering
When the men of God-Forgotten stuck to him
through thick ami thin ?
Does he ever in his dreaming hear the cry above
the cheering :
“ Vote for Blazes and Protection and the land
you’re living in ?”
Ah, the bush was grand in those days, and the
Western boys were daisies,
And their scheming and their dodging would
outdo the wildest print ;
Still my recollection lingers round the time when
Billy Blazes
Was returned by God-Forgotten to the “Com-
min Parlymint, ”
Stilt I keep a sign of canvas—’twas a mate of
mine that made it— '
And its paint is cracked and powdered, and its
threads are bare and thin,
Yet upon its grimy surface you can read in letters
faded :
“Vote for Blazes and Protection and the Land
you’re living in.”
Syd., Feb., ’9l.
JOE SWALLOW.
In the Night.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Steady now, old man; do you feel better?
Here ! hold hard ! I’m not a nigger.”
The wounded man had struggled desperately
as though still wrestling with his foes.
One dead white man, speared through the
body; one with his head cut open, whom the
speaker was trying to revive, and four dead blacks,
lying on their faces with outstretched arms—the
posture in which niggers usually die who meet
with a violent death. The sun had set, and
darkness was rapidly closing in. Presently the
wounded man regained his senses somewhat.
“ How’s Joe? ” he asked.
“ If Joe is your mate, I’m afraid it’s all up with
him, as it would have been with you if I had not
come. Not but what you had done pretty well
before I came. I can only account for one,” and
he motioned towards the dead.
“Yes; I remember. Joe was speared at the
start. He was picking up wood for the fire. How
did you come here?”
“ I ve been after horses all day, and was on my
way home when I heard the row. I got here just
as you had this crack on the head; and the niggers
cleared. I suppose you fellows were bound for
the Cloncurry?”
“Yes. Poor old Joe! Are you quite sure he
is dead ?”
“ Quite sure. Now, what’s the best thing to do
about you ? I suppose you can’t ride ?”
The other shook his head wearily.
“ It’s fifteen miles to the station. The boss has
got a buggy in there, and we’ll bring it out for
you if you’re game to stop here alone while I go.
I’ll be back by daylight. There’s no fear of the
blacks turning up again,*l know the run of these
fellows. ”
“ I’m game,” said the wounded man faintly,
“ Right. I’ll load your revolver up for you, and
be back as soon as I can. Keep your pecker up,
you’re safe enough here.”
With this rough but kindly consolation the
stockman departed, and the survivor of the two
men who had been suddenly attacked by the
natives when camping, was left alone. Not a
pleasant position, but nerves are not supposed to
be known in the outside country.
There was a first-quarter moon, and the
shadows soon got darker and darker beneath its
feeble light. The man with the broken head had
quite recovered his consciousness but he still
felt dizzy and weak. It was an awful time to
wait until daylight. Supposing the niggers came
back again after all! Then he recalled all the
stories he had heard of the blacks mutilating the
dead bodies of their enemies. If they came back
at all it would be for that. Supposing he was
unconscious when they came and they commenced
on him ! He must watch all night to prevent
that. Poor old Joe, his mate, he wouldn’t like
him to be cut up by the darkies.
Surely, he thought, one of the bodies has
moved. The moon gave such a sickly half-light
now it was sinking that it was impossible to make
certain. Yes, it was a dark figure creeping up
to Joe’s body, not one of the dead ones, for he
could still count them—one, two, three, four. A
live nigger crawling up to hack Joe about. He
took aim and fired. That dropped him, he could
see him writhing in the streak of light that broke
through a rift in the trees. Go and finish him, to
save another shot. On his hands and knees he
crawled over, picking up a dropped club on the
way. Then the silence of the night was broken by
fierce, heavy blows, and he crawled back to his
tree and fainted.
The moon had set when he opened his eyes
again, but, by the pale light of the stars, he saw,
to his horror, another black shadow approaching
the dead body of his mate. Another successful
shot and, full of rage, he again crept over and
used the formidable club. But the savages were
not to be deterred: one after another the dark
forms came creeping up, to fall beneath revolver
and club, until at last the man’s senses left him.
The day had broken, but the sun was not yet
up, when the stockman and another man drove up
in the buggy. They jumped out, and hastened
to the apparent sleeper, but he was dead.
“Have the niggers been back and killed him ?”
Ihe stockman shook his head. “I can’t make
it out look at this club in his hand covered with
blood and ”
The two stood up and gazed curiously about.
One, two, three, four black bodies and one red
heap.
“ He wasn’t like that when I left him,” said the
stockman, hastily; “he was speared clean.”
The head was pounded out of recognition, the
body and limbs smashed by maniacal blows ; the
corpse of the wretched Joe was beaten out of all
semblance of humanity.
“There have been no blacks here since I left.”
“ What can be the meaning of that club in his
hand ?” was the reply.

When Your Pants Begin To Go.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When you wear a cloudy collar and a shirt that isn’t
white,
And you cannot sleep for thinking how you’ll
reach to-morrow night—
You may be a man of sorrows, and on speaking
terms with Care,
And as yet be unacquainted with the Demon of
Despair;
But I rather think that nothing heaps the trouble
on your mind
Like tho knowledge that your trousers badly need
a patch behind.
1 have noticed when misfortune strikes the hero
of the play,
That his clothes are worn and tattered in a most
unlikely way ;
And the gods applaud and cheer him while he
whines and loafs around.
And they never seem to notice that his pants ar e
mostly sound;
But, of course, he cannot help it, for our mirth
would mock his care,
If the ceiling of his trousers show’d the patches of
repair.
You are none the less a hero if you elevate your
chin
When you feel the pavement wearing thro’ the
leather, sock, and skin ;
You are rather more heroic than are ordinary
folk
If you scorn to fish for pity under cover of a
joke;
You will face the doubtful glances of the people
that you know,
But —of course, you’re bound to face them when
your pants begin to go.
If, when “flush,” you took your pleasures—failed
to make a god of Pelf,
Some will say that for your troubles you can only
thank yourself—
Some will swear you’ll die a beggar, and you only
laugh at that,
While your garments hang together ahd you wear
a decent hat;
You may laugh at their predictions while your
soles are wearing low—
But a man’s an awful coward when his pants begin
to go.
Tho* the present and the future may be anything
but bright,
It is best to tell the fellows that you’re getting on
ail right,
And a man prefers to say it—’tis a manly lie to
tell,
For the folks may be persuaded that you’re doing
very well;
But it’s hard to be a hero, and it’s hard to wear a
grin,
When your most important garment is in place*
very thin.
Get some sympathy and comfort from the chum
who knows you best,
That your sorrows won’t run over in the presence
of the rest;
There’s a chum that you can go to when you feel
inclined to whine,
He’ll declare your coat is tidy, and he’ll say .
“Just look at mine!”
Tho’ you may be patched all over he will say it
doesn’t show,
And he’ll swear it can't be noticed when your
pants begin to go.
Brother mine, and of misfortune ! times are hard,
but do not fret,
Keep your courage up and struggle, and you’ll
laugh at these things yet,
Tho' there is no corn in Egypt, surely Africa has
some
Keep your smile in working-order for the better
days to come!
We will often laugh together at the hard times
that we know,
And get measured by the tailor when our pants
begin to go.
Now the lady of refinement, in the lap of comfort
rocked,
Chancing on these rugged verses, will pretend
that she is shocked,
Leave her to her smelling-bottle ; ’tis the wealthy
who decide
That the world should hide its patches ’neath the
cruel cloak of pride,
And I think there’s something noble, and I swear
there’s nothing low,
In the pride of Human Nature when its pants
begin to go.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Kiss of Dolly Day.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Did she marry Brown, I wonder ?
Nasty, opulent old beast;
He’d a brow as black as thunder,
And was fifty-five at least.
I have heard no tidings of her
Since she left me in a pet,
But in dreams I’m still her lover,
And I taste her kisses yet.
P/9
Tc" 1 ”
Lives there any other woman—
Wily widow, wife, or miss—
With that subtle, superhuman,
Soul-enthralling kind of kiss ?
I have found some lips as willing,
Hot, and eager for the fray,
But their touch was not as thrilling
As the kiss of Dolly Day.
She would shut her eyes and shiver
When my cheek encountered hers ;
To the sigh I used to give her
She replied with gentle purrs,
Like the purring of a leopard
Feasting fondly on its prey—
Kectar, spiced and cayenne-peppered,
Was the kiss Of Dolly Day.
’Tis a memory that lingers
Though a score of years have fled •
To the tips of all my fingers
I shall feel it when I’m dead*
Of the raptures love-begotten
Which have come and gone for aye
There is one I’ve ne’er forgotten—
That’s the kiss of Dolly Day;
And was crabby Brown her chosen—
Did she marry wealth and ease—•
Was her nature chilled and frozen,
Like the former Mrs. B.’s ?
Aes, of course—the old, old story*
She is gentle, good, and gray,
And the world has lost the glory
Of the kiss of Dolly Day.
EDMUND FISHER.
Melbourne*
When you meet a runaway horse, don’t you
“give him room? ’ When the trams are coming,
don’t you “step aside?” If you see a falling
brick, don’t you “ stand from under?” Of course
you do ! You are aware of the impending danger,
and get out of the way. There are other dangers,
though, that you are much more careless of.
You are careless of your health; you abuse your
strength, perhaps in one way, perhaps in another;
it, however all amounts to the same thing. Where*
ever one draws upon life’s fund so must the
vitality decline; as the health and strength is
depleted so must life be shortened, or made
miserable. Take warning when that tired feeling
first comes on, those intense and occasional head-
aches, those aching limbs and sleepless nights,
they are signs that the nervous system is about to
collapse, and that danger is at hand, it may be
disease, perhaps insanity, perhaps death. Be
warned in time, tackle the first signs ; do not let
debility get a hold on your system or it may be
too late/ When nature warns you that disease is
about to attack you, do the same as if you saw a
chimney-pot descending on your head— stand from
under ; send to your nearest chemist or store-
keeper for Clements Tonic, and continue its use as
long as there is the slightest sign of any disorder.
Don’t think that one bottle is going to restore
strength that you have been wearing out for years.
You can’t nail patches on the human body like
you can on a barn ; you must use proper means to
restore the impaired vitality naturally, and this
cannot be done in a day, but it can be and has
been done in hundreds of severe cases by a proper
and continued use of Clements Tonic, a medicine
that can be depended on to cure every curable
case, and that is saying a good deal. The value
of such a remedy is absolutely proved by Mrs.
Wilson, Times Office, Bulli, N.S.W., who writes ;
—I have much pleasure in adding mine to the
many undoubted testimonies of the value of
Clements Tonic. I have been a long sufferer from
weakness and nervous debility, often unable to
perform some light household duties, and becom-
ing quite prostrated at times. Resort to medical
prescriptions has scarcely ever made any per-
manent improvement in the state of my health.
At last I was induced to try Clements Tonic, and
incredible as it may seem, one bottle produced a
marvellous change—appetite restored, digestion
improved, sick headaches and low-spiritedness
altogether removed. I have given it more than
one trial, and in future shall not be without it or
fail to recommend it to my friends.—(Signed) S.
A. Wilson, Times Office, Bulli, N.S.W,

In making their annual retrospect through the columns of The Bulletin, desire to recognise,
with pardonable pride, the generous patronage given to their
SAFE tIHIDIEi
which, in spite of Professional Opposition and Commercial rivalry, continue to hold their own
in popular estimation and support.
In numberless instances prejudice against Proprietary articles, as such, has to be over-
come before the use of these Remedies is adopted. Much valuable time is thus lost, while the
complaints grow in intensity and the chance of recovery is imperilled. Yet tic . tc icines lave
gained the appreciation of many who have at length tested their value, even under these unfavor-

There is, we are assured, no truth what'
ever in the recently-published statement that the
-A.U.S.N. Co. are interested in the enterprising
firm of Howard Smith and Sons, Limited. The
two companies have absolutely nothing in com-
mon, except that they run side by side in the
trade and charge the same rates over a section of
the coast. Year by year Howard Smith and Sons
(whose only shareholders are the sons of the late
Captain William Howard Smith) are extending
the area of their operations ; they now run all the
way from Port Pirie. S. A., to Townsville, Q.,
calling at every port on the way. They have not
combined with anyone, and don’t mean to.
AN INTERESTING STORY.
Mr. Nicholson, of Leichhardt, called at the Wholesale
Depot of Colemane and Sons a few days ago and expressed
his great thanks staled that some years ago he had been
severely bruised and internally injured, and had tried
various doctors and remedies. His wife noticed in IlieT.
and C. Journal an advertisement of Colemane and Sons,
and suggested his trying same. He scornfully refused,
but a woman’s persistence caused him to take same intern-
ally ; and after taking the contents of five large bottles,
2s. 6d. size, lie is able.to get about and do his duties once
more. Colemane and Sons’ Eucalypte Extract can be vised
also for Coughs, Colds, Asthma, Bronchitis, Rheumatism.

Here at Last!
Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appeals herewith, whereby she became
A. MYSTER.Y
Which no one can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this ; She lay dying of a compli-
cation of diseases ; often she would faint off, and lie unconscious
as long as 30 hours at a stretch— frigid as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance,
often at a cost of Five Guineas a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could suggest was tried ;
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours’ sleep
daily. At last, in desperation, some said, “ Try Mesmerism.”
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; but Mrs. Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own,
never could see anything in it but a hobby of his, and so, when
urged to try it, she ridiculed the very idea ; but they said, “ Try
it for sleep only— you will go mad for want of rest.” For a long
time she could not bring her mind to submit; at last, after much
prayer to God for guidance and help, she was willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passes, she
went off into a peaceful'hypnotic state, which lasted, as was
intended, from eight at night till ten next morning; and she
awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repeated, when
Lo! Everyone was Startled
Mrs. J. N. HARLE.
To find that, whilst to all intents and purposes she was asleep, yet in another sense, the mind was far more awake,
and she commenced talking about what the servant was doing on the ground floor, what an acquaintance was doing a
mile away, what was happening in the home of a dear friend some few blocks away, and so forth. Then she was
requested to look into her own body ; this she did, and was surprised herself, and surprised everyone else, by tracing
the cause of her trouble, which proved to be mainly an internal cancer. She then told them how to cure her.
Crowds of Friends Came to See Her,
For she had a large and influential circle of acquaintances. She astounded all by her marvellous powers of vision—
to see into their bodies as if they were made of transparent glass, to see the members of their families, to know all
about their commercial affairs, seemed quite easy to her; England, America, New Zealand, etc., seemed just like next
door.
The Sensation was Immense!
Drawing-room, Sitting-room, Dining-room and Bedroom were crowded with inquisitive people, and the invalid became
a phenomenon. The doctors were nonplussed with their patient-she gave directions how to soften the cancer to the
lancing state: this was done ; then, as they dare not give chloroform on account of her heart, Mr. Harle put her under
mesmerism, whilst Drs. Teague, of Collins Street, lanced it. She awoke without having felt anything that had hap-
pened. Everyone said: “ Start and use your powers for doing good, you can
Save Lives by Thousands.”
But her health was too low. First, she cured herself—in three months’time she was again taking her accustomed
drives on the Esplanade, in her phaiton, to the astonishment of the whole district. To properly tone the system a
change of climate was needed, and she came to N.S. Wales. For a short time she resided in Maitland ; her retreat
was known by those who were aware of her powers, and she got no peace till she agreed to start practice. Five years
ago Mrs. Harle opened in Newcastle ; three years out of the five have been spent travelling in the Northern district,
and away in the bush discovering gold mines, and she seems to be able to find gold as easy as trace disease.
Seven Thousand People Have Consulted Her
In her mesmeric state ; some about business, but most about their health. Not one can say :“I am worse for your
treatment,” whilst all who have followed the advice and treatment, rejoice in restored health. Mrs. Harle describes
each diseased organ, finds the cause of every trouble, and prescribes remedies and treatment. Her wonderful mental
vision or clear sight enables her to see just what medicine, and how long it will take to cure it, often giving the
medicine three months ahead, and never changing a bottle.
Warning!
If you wish to mortally offend Mrs. Harle, just class her along with the card-reading, palm-scanning, fortune-telling
crowd, and the task is done. No such rubbish ! Mrs. Harle is mesmerised by her husband, and when in the hypnotic
state, she sees with her mind. She cannot open her eyes, yet she hears, talks, asks and answers questions, etc. When
the mesmerism is undone, she awakes, and knows no more of what has happened, than if she had been chloroformed
or dead. n
It Causes a Terrible Mental Strain,
Therefore, Mr. Harle reserves the right to say when she has done enough, and may refuse any or all at such times.
The Fee is half-a-guinea for bodily examination, and a guinea for business advice. The half-guinea includes a
complete tracing of your case, and a full statement of how to cure you. Business men have vo'untarily paid as high as
£5, and even £l5, for the arrangement of a business tangle. She guarantees in all cases a full value in the treatment,
and more satisfaction all round than can possibly be obtained by any other means whatever. Special medicine is
prepared for each case treated. Mrs. Harle is prepared to work with the family physician or any qualified medical
man, if her suggestions are carried out. She is prepared to treat any case that can be cured, but insists upon only
using her Eclectic Botanic Remedies -she has no faith in mineral medicinefe. It is desirable to make appointments or
come early in the day, whilst her brain power is fresh. Outdoor visits must also be arranged.
Simple cases send £1; Complicated Cases send £s—with age, sex, occupation, all symptoms, particulaily state of
bowels, how long suffering, and a Photo, if you have one (w-e will return it) and you will receive post or rail free a
course of Mrs. Harle’s latest marvellous remedies and her personal care of your case—with full advice on diet and
exercise, &c.
p.S.—Mrs. Harle’s chief reason for visiting Sydney for some six months is to introduce her Remedies to the
Public, and open a Dispensary w'here people may call and see her or write for the Remedies or call for them.

ITHOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 515 George Street,
, Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, do hereby
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “ UNIVERSAL ALFALINE
FILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since. /
THE ALF ALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

Opinions of the Press.
Proving the Wonderful ALFALINE REMEDIES to
be Genuine^
“ Herr tlasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist,
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-
forming many great cures during the last few years, as his
numerous testimonials will prove.”—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials Which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.”—Sydney Evening
News.
“Herr Rassmussen counts the cutes effected by his
Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian
Reputation, and has secured the respect and gratitude of
numerous patients whom his Remedies have restored to
Health and Happiness.”—“Centennial History of N.S.W.”
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of
the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.”— Australian Star.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to
the Australian public to require any additional praise from
Truth. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.” — Truth.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical
Herbalist, holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.-S. Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland.” — Cooktown Courier (Q.).
“ It may not be out of place to mention that Herr
Rassmussen has now been established in the colonies for
nearly 10 years.”—Sydney Sunday Times,
“Herr Rassmussen’s press notices in all the other
colonies agree in regard to the skill he possesses as a Herba-
list, and the bona fides of his testimonials appear to be well
established.” — S.A. Register, Adelaide.
“ Herr Rassmussen has achieved a high reputation for
his skill in botanical treatment of disease.”— Evening
Journal, Adelaide.

Coleraane and Sons, Cootamundra, whose trade has in-

Mrs. Beetou says: “ Claret should be
sound, fruity, and soft as satin, and all the com-
ponents happily blended into a homogeneous
whole. Easy of .digestion, it is a mildly stimu-
lating drink, in every way fulfilling the Scriptural
character as a ‘ wine that maketh glad the heart
of man. 1 ’” Innes’s Boar’s Head Clarets, at all
grocers, at Is., Is. 6d., 25., and 3s. a bottle, can
be recommended as purer and better wines than
French clarets, and they are only one-third of the

With reference to a recent Bulletin
paragraph concerning the Brilliant Worcester and
Victory Co.’s mine, Charters Towers, we have it
on the best authority that the statement to the
effect that Mr. Clarke, the Towers hotelkeeper,

untrue. We have to express our regret that the
statement in question should have been published.

the real true light of legitimate knowledge, acquired only by years of hard study and practical
experience. Mrs. RUPPERT does not powder or paint you, but clears your skin to a natural, healthy
state. Tithe wears our skin the same as it wears our gowns; then why not, by natural means (not
cosmetics), do all we can to improve it? Mrs. RUPPERT begs Ladies not to hesitate to call on her,
as her profession is a purely scientific one, and they need have no hesitation —all matters in perfect
confidence. In America and England, where Madame RUPPERT is known to be such a helper to
her sisters, Ladies consider it rather an honour to b,e able to see this eminent specialist, whose every
hour is taken up while there. She cannot change facial expression, but can conscientiously say—
guarantee —that her excellent SKIN TONIC will positively remove all discolorations and imper-
fections such as acne, eczema, freckles, roughness, oilyness, excessive redness, &c. ; these ailments all
being the result of the blood purifying itself and leaving its sediment in the skin. This wonderful
SKIN TONIC is not a cover, but a tonic which tones and cleanses the pores, leaving them healthy.
Mrs. RUPPERT has already cured numerous patients of acne, eczema, &c., since her stay in England
and France, who had been previously treated by famous doctors and received no benefit, living
examples at her offices. All over the globe this excellent SKIN TONIC-is guaranteed and sold at

‘ IDEAL.
The Loading’ of the Pride.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Clipper ship, the Pride of Commerce, loading- now
with hides and wool,
Advertised to sail on Monday— stevedore must
get her full,
Stevedore must have her ready, be he well or be he
HI,
And, if stevedore won’t do it, we can find a man
who will.
Re-a-rally! Ri-a-rally! “Twenty men to go below.
Xuw, my lads, I want no loafing—grafters only
gets a show.
Boss I am, and boss I will be, and I’ll have no
skulking here;
It’s Drafting down below, men,
It’s go it all you know, men,
Till the skipper gets his papers and the ‘peter’s’
up to clear.”
Tropic climate, iron vessel, greasy wool —peculiar
smell
Down below, the atmosphere is very near allied to
Hell,
Down below in shirt and trousers, sweating,
swearing like a Turk,
Stevedore is stowing cargo, glad enough to be at
work.
“ Re-a-rally ! ri-a-rally ! Give that screw another
shake.
Agent says we’ve got to load her, ev’ry bloomin’
pound she ll take.
Promised owner “ goby Monday ’’and we mustn’t
miss a bale —
So it’s ram her, jam her, cram her,
Fire her cargo in and damn her,
For the other boat is loading and they’ll race her
for the sale. ”
Stevedore is mostly idle while the winter drags
away,
Now, the sun of work is shining and he means to
make his hay ;
“ Bob ” an hour and sweat, half-roasted, till his
socks are wet with slime;
“ Bob ” an hour and, if he’s lucky, one-and-six for
overtime.
“ Re-a-rally ! Ri-a-rally ! Why the devil don't you
sweat ?
Don’t you see them after-hatches ain’t been
touched at all as yet ?
S’elp-me-Gawd ! you make me shrivel; can’t you
bend your lazy back ?
If you don’t go at it quicker,
May I never drink my licker,
But I’ll go below and give you, every mother’s
- son, the sack !”
Skipper, in the after-cabin, has, a “ lady ” to
amuse;
Mate and friend are sipping whisky—mate is
somewhat on the booze.
Purser comes aboard for dinner, “ second's” taking
tally here,
Crew are for’ard making merry on some bad
colonial beer.
“ Re-a-rally! Ri-a-rally! Stand from under ! Mind
the slings!
Hang it! Use yer hook, you duffer ! Can’t you
catch her as she swings ?
’Tarnal fool! he’s gone and missed it ! Hist away
there, quick’s y’ can !
Why the blazing Son of Thunder
Couldn’t he have stood from under ?
Leg’s broke ! Can’t move ! Look sharp ! Fetch
along a basket —and a man !”
Pulleys’ strain and winches’ rattle echoed from the
rival ship;
Both must be “at home” discharging when they
sell the season’s clip.
London market must be studied. Monarch’s wait-
ing for the tide,
And I’ll sink the ship or beat him, says the captain
of the Pride.
“ Re-a-rally! ri-a-rally, re-a, ri-a-rally ho!
Come ashore and lend a hand, lads ! Slip her
lines and let her go.
Yes ! she draws a lot of water, but they’ll get her
out by dark,
And I’ll wager half-a-crown, sir,
That the Monarch’s deeper down, sir,
Even if the Pride is just aleetle past her Plimsoll-
mark.”
Agent on the wharf stands smiling. Says to
skipper with a bow :
“We have kept our promise, captain, to her owners
you’ll allow.”
Hatches down and gangway hoisted —Pride’s in
tow behind her boat,
And, his help no longer needed, stevedore puts on
his coat,
“Re-a-rally! ri-a-rally! Now, then, fill ’em up
once more.
All the crew was drunk as niggers when the pilot
kem ashore !
And the captain and the mate, sirs, was as tight
as tight could be ;
But we’ve earned a ‘ bob ’ or two,
Let her sink or struggle through,
We’ve crammed her to the hatches —that’s enough
for you and me.”

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Is everywhere recommended as the best rem-
edy for the cure of scrofula, scrofulous and
cancerous humors, chronic catarrh, eczema,
boils, pimples, sores, and all disorders origina-
ting in impure blood. It neutralizes and elimi-
nates the acids that cause rheumatism, gout,
and dropsy. It regulates the liver and kidneys,
gives tone to the stomach, increases the appe-
tite, aids digestion,
Cures Dyspepsia,
and makes the weak strong. No other blood
purifier is composed of such carefully selected,
highly concentrated, and skilfully united in-
gredients. For nearly half a century this prep-
aration has, in both hemispheres, been the
standard tonic and strengthening medicine. It
is universally approved by the medical profes-
sion, and benefits the enfeebled system at all
seasons of the year.

PEMELL’S
SNOW-WHITE
HOLLER ELOUE.
The last act of a Chinese drama has just
been played at Wellington (M.L.). A year or
two ago some larky youths went out late one night
and started staving in some Chinamen’s houses
with stones. The Chows defended themselves
gallantly; they swarmed out of their bunks and
fought naked in the highway, and in the melee
one white man was stabbed and bled to death,
and one Mongol’s head was fractured with a fence-
rail. The white man was buried ; the Mongol
who killed him got off on a plea of self-defence;
and the broken-headed Buddhist recovered physi-
cally, but his intelligence gradually left him. At
last, after a gradual course of brain-softening, he
was found going round the city with cabbagee at
2 a.m., and then he was locked up in the asylum.
There he grew violent, and after filling the place
with din and riot he staved in his head, nine ribs,
and his breast-bone against the cell-floor, and
died. At least, that was the story told at the
inquest, but the local papers are raising a row
about an alleged habit which some asylum
attendants have of walking on refractory patients
with their knees. When a man batters himself
to death in an asylum it almost always happens
that his ribs and breast-bone are stove in, and as
no lunaiio outside an asylum ever suicides that
way, the matter seems to call for a whole lot of
inquiry.
DOROTHY STANLEY,
wife of the great African explorer, visited Colemane and
Sons’ Branch Wholesale Depot, Christchurch (N.Z.), a few
days ago, to lay in a stock of their celebrated Eucalypte
Extract before leaving for Europe. This noted Coota-
mundra firm has just had a large order from Germany,
where the influenza is raging. The Rev. J. A. Soper, of
Petersham, under date January 30, writes: “I have just
.come out of a severe cold by use of your Eucalypte fix-
tract. I did not know the virtue of it till now.” See that
you get Colemane and Sons’ ; also their Special Oil for

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
nT V T WORTH CALLS.
GHIIS MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACllfiS has been
surveyed by Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydiiey, int° 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
J>GBidential Blocks to lOj Acres, situate only 500-yards
Rom the WENTWORTH FALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of K. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger,on the Groat Western railway.
W hen the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may be'safely described as
The Madeira of I lie Blue Mountains.
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing-parity of the ’mountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
is well described by the poet, viz.:—
The waratah, all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
Shines through the clustering ferns;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
Falls in soft showers, its deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know?
’Tis the charming Estate of Fontainebleau!
The Blaxiand Road is now being-made from the Railway
fence, and, as it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be without exception the finest
Carriage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the most elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls far and away
superior to the land on the other side of the line. The
picturesque views and the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Daily Farms,
for which Nature seems to have intended it.
KSF" Early Buyers will do well to secure their Lots at
once, as they are likely to largely advance in value. The
terms are liberal, to suit all buyers. For lithos., and all
