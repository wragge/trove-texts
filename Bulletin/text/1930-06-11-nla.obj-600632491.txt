Kendalliana—(1)
A word to recent protectants that. Kendall
c not the poet he 'haSbocn acclaimed to
be. Read his early work in "Poems and
bongs (1862) and produce another writer
who lias so deeply felt and so truly inter-
preted the spirit of Nature, the landscape
and seascape, of the s.-e. corner of Aus-
tralia For singing pictures of that little
bit of native Bush, all its beautiful and
curious sights and sounds of air and earth
and water, Ivendall is unsurpassed. There
are other ways of poetry; that is one good
Australian way; and Kendall first travelled
it to something like poetical perfection.
Really he .has been misrepresented by his
editors. Alexander Sutherland., the Mel-
bourne schoolmaster, and . after him
Frederick Kendall have, preferred .in selec-
tion the “literary” poems, the rhetorical
poems, that .Kendall wrote when he was try-
ing, poor chap! to improve himself. Always
he was getting farther from natural vision
and sincere feeling into conventional senti-
ment and sonorous verbiage.
It is settled that Kendall was born- in
1839, not in 1841, and that his true name
was Thomas Henry Kendall, after his
grandfather the missionary to New Zealand ;
not Henry Clarence Kendall; though he
wrote his name “Henry Clarence Kendall”
when he married in 1868.- Why? Perhaps
the best explanation is that it was “a. bit
of swank.” Despite his current of satirical,
levity, Kendall took seriously himself and
his poetic calling. While lie could, he
strutted like chieftain in front of an
admiring tribe.
Kendall as a Civil Servant at about
the time of his marriage, decked in tall
silk hat, frock-coat and kid gloves,-■ was a
sight worth looking at. When lie came in
1869 to Melbourne, he clung desperately,
poor poet! to his garb of dignity. He could
not be separated from his umbrella, rolled
tightly into the mode of fashion. Vainly gay
sparks at the Yorick Club sought to seduce
him from the protection of the umbrella—
that badge of professional gentility con-
temned by Henry Parkes. “But what do
you do when it rains, Sir Henry?” “I take
a cab,” squeaked the sly old statesman.
Kendall existed for about two vears in
Melbourne (1869-71). After his death ii
1882, G. G. MeCrae, reminiscing, said lie
“looked like an undertaker.” In Melbourne
Kendall’s family and Sydney friends—Daley
Myers, Holdsworth—remembered him as
finite a lively chap; in spite of underlying
sadness.
MeCrae was brought to Victoria as a chile
in the early days, and spent his manly life
in the Victorian Civil Service. Retired oi
pension, he was known even to this genera-
tion in Melbourne as a fine old Seottisl
gentleman till his death at the honorable
age oi 94. An amiable and persistent dilet-
tante in art and letters, he wrote innumer-
able verses in his spare time; and pub-
lished several little books now forgotten.
The Kendalls, returning to Sydney, grate-
fully acknowledged MeCrae’s kindness in
Melbourne; but—poets are an irritable race.
As a youngster, I frequently heard P. J.
Holdsworth repeat Kendall’s own recollec-
tions of his gruesome life in Melbourne.
Kendall’s notion of MeCrae, as repeated
by Holdsworth, is .worth putting against
McCrae’s notion of Kendall; resented by
Kendall’s warm-hearted Sydney friends.
Leaving the office in the afternoon,
MeCrae liked to fraternise with the Mel-
bourne literary clan at the Yorick Club,
founded by Marcus Clarke. Liberally he
paid his footing; but—he carried his poetry
in his pocket!
Holdsworth pictured Kendall, both hun-
gry and thirsty, sitting in one of the two
rooms that constituted the Yorick Chib in
1870, trying to do himself and his patrons
credit in his best shabby Sydney clothes.
Fro Ck-coat, tall hat, gloves and umbrella—
the relics of his own Civil Service job in
Sydney. Poor fellow! he had no other gar-
ments.
Sitting coughing gloomily, on the chance
that somebody would come in and offer him
a pound to write an article; sitting desper-
,aJely—because it was bitter cold in the
Melbourne winter, and his best clothes had
been pawned to pay the rent of the Bruns-
wick hovel where his wife sat thinking of
her dead baby, and waiting for Harry to
turn up something in the way ot employ-
ment. Sitting shivering, because he had
only a crust of bread and a cup of tea for
breakfast; and had missed his dinner, and
there was nothing under the frock-coat bid
an undershirt, a collar, and a “dickey.” Not.
a penny in his pocket, and hugging his um-
brella as his sole defence against the bleak
rain ot Melbourne; because his overcoat
was shelved with “Uncle” and he had no
money to redeem it.
To him enter MeCrae. the prosperous and
kindly Civil Servant with a literary hobbv;
MeCrae. with a questing eye, glittering when
it iastened on the haggard and broken-
down Ivendall—glittering with the emotion
ot the poet who perceives his audience, his
prey. Kendall lifts his sunken gaze and
shudders; not altogether with the cold; he
knows the doom that approaches. He has
a clear opinion of McCrae’s poetry; but,
in courtesy, he must not utter it.
After the genial welcome and the hospit-
able preliminaries. Kendall, with fascinated
eyes, watches McCrae’s hand go to his
pocket, and come forth with a sheaf of
manuscript. “Er—since I have had the good
fortune to meet with you, Mr. Kendall
—you know how highly I value your
literary opinion—will you permit me to
read to you some of my own little verses?”
And “Kendall looked like an undertaker ”
“\\hy not?’ asked Holdsworth. “He was
burying the dead.”
A.G.S.
A Sydney Realist
L. VY. Lower's "Here’s Luck” (Angus
:uu! Robertson) is the first novel about
Sydney in which all • the characters are
unmistakable. Sydneyites, and probably the
first that has ever, beep written on the
subject of a. drinking bout. It is an
extravaganza with an undertone of tragic
disillusionment.
Gudgeon, suburbanite and dipsomaniac,
is the father of Stanley (“about eighteen
or nineteen, I am not sure which”) and the
husband of Agatha,
It is absolutely ridiculous to call a man of fortv-
eiglit old. I am perhaps u little under medium
height, hut then mere, height is nothing. .Notice
the relative Importance of .Napoleon and the. giraffe.
Stanley, who is taller and thinner, and
supposed to be working for a Public Service
examination,, is “a fountain of fluid elo-
quence.”
lie comes home in the small hours of the morning
with an ironclad alibi, and even the wife can
find no chink in his armor of excuses. *
Father and son go off to a city restaurant,
having been refused dinner at home, pick
up a couple of women, -and are found out.
Mrs. Gudgeon and her sister Gertrude go
home to their mother and Gudgeon and
Stanley organise a party.
There were the Boys: a crowd of immature dance-
hall thug's who ran mainly to legs and reactionary
suits. There was Sadie and a hoy friend, and a
girl friend and her boy friend, and the barman
and chief chuckermut at Flannery's. The. milkman
was there with an alleged female of the ultra-
modern type who could not be definitely placed as
a boy or a girl, but was best classified* as a Boil.
People I did not know kept coming in in bunches.
I tried to count them, but they moved about too
much.
Later, Gudgeon and Stanley back winners
at Randwick find have another party.
Agatha’s brother from the backbloeks ’is
thera; and Woggo, a pugilist whom' they
have met with Steak and Eggs, the restaur-
ant ladies, introduces a few friends:—
“This is me spariin’ partner, Cocoa Collins, - ’, said
Woggo. “One er the mob. This is Smacker. ’E’s
a fireman at the Crematorium. V’ know Dogsbody,”
In- added as Simpson came to the gate in front’ of
five imore men. “The big bloke with the chewed
car is the ’eavyweight ehampeen of Tasmania,” he
continued, pointing them out one by one.. “Bung
Thomas ’is name is. This is Mickey the doorkeeper
at Watson’s two-up school. ’E’s only little but ’e’s
all there. The other three is Johutio, Corpsey and
Splinter. Preliminary boys. Ten roundersj and
none of ’em work. Any’ow you’ll know ’em all
before the night’s out.”
Gudgeon is last seen where he would end
in life-—in an inebriates’ home. His wife
is Coming to visit him (having forgiven him
as the wives of such men usually do), and
•So is Flannery, the pub-keeper. “I hope
Flannery doesn’t fail me,” he reflects, and
writes a letter to Mr. Sloove, M.P., who had
Ipeen at the second party, suggesting a job
for Stanley “in some fairly remote light-
house.” After which the cynically true
ending: “Here comes Flannery. Thank
God!”
Mr. Lower makes no concessions to senti-
ment or respectability. He is ruthless in
depicting life as he sees it, and he owes
nothing to any other writer in style or out-
look. His -humor is as expressive a* Wode-
house’s (“The champagne enlivened me.
It thrilled and uplifted me like the fangs

and drunken atmosphere in which his
characters move. Grossmith (“Diary of a
Nobody”), Street (“Trials of the Ban-
tocks”), Jerome, Anstey, Pett Ridge, Bur-
nand and others have dealt with suburban-
ites pf the financial status of Gudgeon. But
their smug, class-conscious Londoners are
as different from Lower’s ribald and lawless
Sydneyites as if they inhabited another
planet. It may not be a cheering thought
for the righteous, but no one who is
acquainted with Sydney will deny that he
has provided a recognisable picture of a
section of it.
JOHN DALLEY.
Lambert: Painter, Sculptor, Egoist
George Lambert managed to get out of
57 years of life a tremendous amount of
work and fun. He was not born in Aus-
tralia, but was one of the best of her
adopted sons; a man of all-round talent,
a wonderful raconteur and the life of many
a social gathering. But always he had to
come first.
George was born in St. Petersburg, and
when his father, an engineer of railways,
died the mother and son left for England
and later for Australia, where they went
on to a relative’s sheep station out west.
There George learned all about station life.
He could fence, shear sheep and all that,
and learned to ride. All this time his spare
moments were filled by drawing everything
round him. He was a born draughtsman,
so that when he came to Sydney he sub-
mitted some of his pen-drawings to Mr.
Macleod, of The Bulletin, and they were
shown to me. I suggested they showed
great ability and that the draughtsman was
worth encouraging. Shortly afterwards he
joined the Art Society’s classes tinder Julian
Ashton, whom he subsequently acknow-
ledged as his master.
Before he won the Society of Artists’
travelling scholarship for three years, got
married and went to Paris he made several
sketching trips to the country. One party
at Richmond (N.S.W.), where he did a good
deal of work, included “The Breaker,” the
old Bulletin contributor who later was shot
in South Africa. About one happening
there George was always quiet. A man
at the hotel wanted to fight, and George
arranged a go in one of the bams near by.
This came off one afternoon unknown to
any of us. They fought all the afternoon—
no seconds, no timekeeper, just a fight—
and we only learned of it after when George
came out for a bucket of water to restore
his antagonist.
When George had done his Paris three
years he came over to London to make
some money, and did work for the “Pall
Mall Magazine,” signing his name, “G. W.
Lambert of N.5.W.,” which looked curious,
but showed his loyalty to Australia. He
continued also his work for The Bulletin,
for which he made in all over 200 drawings.
His first picture in the Royal Academy,
hung on the line, was a portrait of artist
Thea Proctor. At that same exhibition and
in the same gallery was the work of 18. Aus-
tralian artists—it looked like an Australian
exhibition. Lambert held an audience all
day in front of his work, which was very
fine. From this on he painted portraits
and small pictures, but his output was not
very large; he was a slow worker, but very
persistent and thorough—-a great craftsman.
At private views George always made him-
self known. He was a great showman as
well as a fine artist; he said it was no good
producing a fine picture without letting-
people know it, and he did it quite well.
When the war started in 1914 most artists
at the Chelsea Club joined the United
Arts Corps; but, for all our good inten-
tions, the War Office wouldn’t recognise us,
so some of us enlisted. Lambert went into
South Wales to boss a mob of stranded
Russians and Poles cutting timber for the
mines. - Then he was appointed official
artist to the A.I.F. in Palestine, which suited
him because he was attached to the Light
Horse and knew he could draw a horse
inside and out. With his uniform and
beard he looked very much like General
Smuts, and was saluted by staff officers in
Whitehall and elsewhere—which also suited
him.
He had a supreme belief in himself. Once
he spent a whole evening telling me of a
small domestic row he had had. I suggested
at last that he was going back on his own
judgment. He thought a minute; then,
slapping his chest, he said “By God, you’re
right, of course,” and cheerfully returned to
the fold.
A. HENRY FULLWOOD.
A Unique Book
The Legion Book (Cassell; Angus and
Robertson) has been called unique, and
the description is probably right in several
ways. It was written and illustrated at the
personal invitation of the Prince of Wales.
It holds new work of upwards of 50 lead-
ing writers and artists, fairly representative
of the Empire. Profits will go to the
British Legion, the ex-servicemen’s organi-
sation which the Prince has helped more
than once before. In Britain, at least, the
money resulting from its sale is regarded as
a thank-offering for the recovery of the
King. One other thing; as the Prince of
Wales has characteristically put it, the book
is “not a dud.” It is splendidly bound
admirably printed; an excellent collection
of first-rate writing, with drawings of the
King, Queen, Prince, Prime Ministers and
others.
In this section Australia is represented
by Low; a page from his sketch book. Low
may not be doing the great cartoon work
that made his reputation on The Bulletin,
but in caricature he has few equals. His
page includes beauties of Chesterton,
Bennett and Churchill. Australia’s repre-
sentative in the literary section is Professor
Gilbert Murray; a translation from the
Serenade to Amaryllis. South Africa’s
representative is Sarah Gertrude Millin,
and Bliss Carman stands for Canada.
Britain’s mighty host includes Galsworthy,
Hugh Walpole, Kipling, Edgar Wallace
(not a horror yarn, but a human inquiry
into the character of Thomas Atkins),
Bennett, Bridges, Binyon, Margaret Ken-
nedy, Huxley, David Garnett, Newbolt,
Coppard, Squire, Storm Jameson, Wode-
house, Drinkwater, Blunden, Chesterton,
Belloc, Humbert Wolfe, Davies, Edith Sit-
well, Rebecca West and Walter de la Mare.
The artists include Augustus John, Max
Beerbohm, Epstein, Sargent, Mcßey, Cope,
Llewellyn, “Poy,” Clare Leighton and
sundry others. There are pencil drawings,
woodcuts, chalk, charcoal and wash illustra-
tions. The literature includes short stories,
the beginning of an uncompleted novel,
essays and verse. The price is a guinea,
and, considered as a literary offering alone,
there is good value for the money.
A Satchel of Books
The Specialist, by Charles Sale (Put-
nam’s; Dymock’s). The fine English edition
of the slightly Rabelaisian, broadly funny
experiences and homilies of Lem Putt.
Marry at. Y'ols. 13, 15 and .16 of Dent’s
inexpensive edition of the Service romancer
are “Joseph Rushbrook or The Poacher,”
“Monsieur Violet” and “The Privateersman.”
The edition will be completed in 22 vols.
New Worlds to Conquer, by Richard Halli-
burton (Bles). Travel over Mexico, Nica-
ragua and thereabout, with 70-feet dives into
the Well of Death, a 50-mile swim in the
Panama and such-like exploits. Breezy; a
bit juvenile; fair of its kind.
A Wedding Gift, by John Taintor Foote
(Appleton; Dymock’s). Reprint of the
harrowing story poured by George Potter
into the ear of a friend whilst awaiting the
train on which liis wife was returning to
“hear his explanation.” George, confirmed
rod fisherman and bachelor, married a sweet
young thing and took her fishing for the
honeymoon. Breaking point came when
Isabelle, posted with the landing-net to finish
off his few hours’ struggle with a magnificent
trout, lifted the net and brought it down
wallop on the fish. George thereupon told
her to . Well, any man who has ever
fished will know what he told her to do.
Travellers’ Rest, by Mrs. Henry Dudeney
(Collins), suffers from the defect of most
religious novels. It is prosy. Clara Foun-
tain is first encountered in a convent (Angli-
can variety) on the morning of an unspeci-
fied festival as the bell is ringing for mass.
She is thinking of becoming a nun when
her brother Richard, who is a priest, takes
her to live with him. Then she marries the
half-demented Simon Flattery, who thrashes
her (“Mother,” he says after one painful
episode, “you must save me from Clara. I
might have murdered her if she hadn’t got
away”), leaves him, and commits bigamy
with the absurd Bruce Fury. It is impos-
sible to sympathise with this unbalanced
young woman, or to feel that she would have
muddled things less completely in a convent
than in the world.
Games and Gamesters of the Restoration
(Routledge). Contents; “The Compleat
Gamester,” by Charles Cotton (1674), and
“Lives of the Gamesters,” by Theopbilus
Lucas (1714), with an introduction by C.
H. Hartman and illustrations from contem-
porary prints. Cotton, with his usual
seriosity, describes the prevalent games in
his pre-Hoyle manner, and thus provides
interesting comparisons against the same
games as played to-day. Lindrum makes a
fair break with an umbrella, but he might
not score many with the business end of a
hockey stick, which somewhat resembles the
cue’s forerunner. Lucas writes potted biog-
raphies of gamesters, which ring suspiciously
of the fib, but make brighter reading than
Cotton. Quaint documents, spicy as a Christ-
mas duff, but lighter.
Beast or Man, by Sean McGuire (Cecil
Palmer), has great possibilities. A mis-
sionary and his wife are butchered by
gorillas in West Africa. The gorillas rear
their baby boy, and his descendant has the
strength of a gorilla and the organising
capacity of a human being. He creates a
gorilla army, and is its general. A grand-
niece of the missionary’s wife is engaged
to John Passinger, who goes hunting gorillas
in West Africa, and captures his fiancee’s
cousin. At this promising stage the story
goes to pieces. The hairy warrior is civil-
ised, given a name (Peter), and transformed
into a thorough-paced prig. Then Peter
gets killed while heroically rescuing a child
from a fire. He had become a social suc-
cess (“there was hardly a man, woman or
child who did not attend the funeral”), but
it was a happy release. The next stage in his
education might have been to make him
wear trousers.

“Ela”: The latest locality to be bitten
by the censor bug is Port Moresby, an
Arcadian spot in Papua which, in the past
at least, never fashed itself greatly about
morals, good or bad. The local Library Insti-
tute has been overcome by some aspects of
“Jew Suss,” which has, apparently, only
just reached that somewhat retired spot,
and has condemned it to be burned by
the public hangman or his local equivalent.
Furthermore, it has appointed a special com-
mittee which will in future sit in judgment
on all new books coming to the institute.
What it will do with some of the old ones
on its shelves, including the Bible, which
was part of the institute’s foundation-stock
of books, only the future can show us.

THE TIDE HAS TURNED!
Australia has been supplied with complete
commerce returns for 10 months of the
year 1929-30, and they show that up to
the end of April the bad position was still
becoming worse, but not quite at the old
pace. The patient was still sinking, but
not so fast. In addition returns of Customs
revenue have come to hand for 11 months
—to the end of May. The complete
trade records for the same period won’t be
available for another four weeks, and they
are anxiously expected, but the figures deal-
ing with Customs receipts are highly satis-
factory. They show, though without much
detail, that the tide has turned in a
definite way and that the patient isn’t
sinking any longer. He is rising. The fact
that tariff revenue for May, 1930, was
£674,145 less than that for May, 1929, is
proof that imports are heavily on the
decline, and the fact that the yield from
duties has fallen, though the rate of duties
has greatly increased, indicates that the
decline in imports is more than the mere
figures might suggest. A great deal of
polite consideration was shown to the over-
seas manufacturer whose goods were under
order, or actually on the way to Australia,
when the new tariff was established, so it
required quite a while before its beneficent
effects were apparent to any great extent.
Meanwhile the Freetrader scoffed with a
vast scoff, and talked of “failure.” Now
that the effect is really manifest and Aus-
tralian white-labor products get a show, his
attitude is that Australian wares are inferior
in quality, and sometimes |d. per ton
dearer than overseas articles. Being always
anti-Australian one scoff avails him as well
as another.
Until extra money begins to come in
from other sources through the return of
prosperity, it is liable to follow that the
Treasurer will be short of paper income.
If £lOO of foreign debt and the eternal
interest thereon, both payable in gold, are
saved, and in addition Australian employ-
ment and wages receive a great impetus,
the immediate temporary loss of £25 in
paper money is excusable. Everything costs
something. Even all-round sobriety would
involve a staggering deficit in Customs and
excise receipts, licenses and fines collected
for drunkenness and “language.” Economy,
possibly a little extra taxation, and some
small local loans payable, principal and
interest, in paper will easily meet the tem-
porary difficulty.
The size of the problem which accumu-
lated till the stoppage of overseas loans
made further shirking impossible may be
put in a few simple figures:—
Imports to
Exports, be Paid for
Including Gold, Including
but not Interest
Gold Reserves and Other
Abstracted Outside
Year, from Banks. Liabilities. Deficit.
1925- .. £146,426,345 £183,217,425 £36,791,080
1926- . . 135,212,345 197,327,759 62,115,414
1927- .. 141,686,723 181,936,540 40,249,817
1928- . . 142,867,986 178,281,449 35,413,463
10 Months
1929- 83,427,046 143,842,438 60,415,392
That explains the closing years of a “good
time,” and the situation as it is to-day. In
1922-23-24 Australia had quite a pile of
money (its own money and unspent loan
funds) available in London. The sum
at its credit was put down at 51 millions
in 1921-22 and there was still remaining
2H millions in June, 1924. It spent that
to begin with. It spent new loans on a
gorgeous scale till the overseas loan market
began to fail. It spent, and is still spend-
ing, the proceeds of bank overdrafts and
other odds and ends of accommodation.
Then it exported and spent £24,000,000 of
the banks’ gold reserves, and this process
could go a little further, but not very much
further, without becoming dangerous. Now
rumor has it that a great British institu-
tion, or certain institutions, will see. the
Commonwealth through for a. reasonable
period, provided it puts its house in order.
In the interval the overseas loan market
may revive, but it is advisable that this
country should be able to dispense with it
as there may be no big revival for a long
while.
It might be classed as the cussedness of
inanimate objects that the great fall hr
prices came at, the worst possible time. No
one is responsible for the fact that nine
months’ exports of wool and wheat to
March, 1930, were valued at £34,000,000 as
compared with £66,000,000 to March, 1929,
and that other things dropped as well. No
one can make the prices go up. No one
can say when or how far they will go up.
No one can grow enough extra wool and
wheat in any reasonable time to anything
like make good the loss, even if the arrival
of all that extra produce on the market
didn’t tend to depress prices. And no one
can beguile the importer to reduce the cost
of foreign goods sufficiently to balance the
local troubles. So the Government has
taken the line of restoring the balance by
a forcible reduction of imports, which is
the one thing it can do, and has done it
amid the bitter protests of Freetraders who
only want office, and now and then of Com-
munists who rather want national bank-
ruptcy and revolution as things much
favored in Moscow.
WHERE ARBITRATION WORKS.
The Federal Conciliation and Arbitration
Act is not, as experience has proved, an
effective implement for the preservation of
peace in industry, and it obviously needs
to be either mended or ended. As the
electorate will not allow it to be ended,
the duty of the Government to mend it is
plain. To that end Ministers propose to
repeal certain punitive clauses which they
consider provocative and unnecessary, and
to entrust all the detail work of making
wages awards and settling conditions of
labor in the hands of Conciliation Commis-
sioners, the object being, as expressed in a
proposed new preamble to the Act, “to
promote goodwill in industry by conciliation
and arbitration.”
This is a reversion, in its main principles,
to the system prescribed in Maoriland’s
I. C. and A. Act of 1894, under which Con-
ciliation Boards were set up, consisting of
one to three representatives on either side,
with a chairman from outside the industry.
These boards heard evidence and in effect
drafted a tentative award, which might be
accepted by the parties. If they did not
accept it the case went before the Arbitra-
tion Court and was threshed out all over
again.
For a few years that system worked well.
Wages were low and hours long and the
boards and the Court were able to give the
unions substantial benefits. But the
boards practically ceased to function after
1901, the Court was overworked and the
hearing of cases was delayed sometimes for
as long as a year. The authority of the
Court and the impartiality of its Judges was
not, however, challenged till 1906. Between
1906 and 1913 some of the stronger unions
grew restive and kicked over the traces.
Judges were, personally attacked; attempts
to inflict penalties on striking unions proved
farcical. The end of the Conciliation Boards
came in 1908, mainly as a result of the
vast waste of time and effort involved in
the endeavor of the Canterbury farm-
laborers to obtain an award. A Concilia-
tion Board, the chairman of which kept a
fancy-goods shop in Christchurch, toured
the province for months and heard hun-
dreds of witnesses. And then the Court
spent a great deal of its valuable time
over the same dispute.
Under the amended Act of 1908 the
boards were scrapped, and Conciliation
Councils, consisting of three assessors on
each side, with a Conciliation Commissioner,
an officer of the Labor Department, as chair-
man, took their place. These councils in
practice are purely conciliatory. The chair-
man has no judicial powers, and acts merely
as a mediator. At first the system was rather
distrusted by the unions; but when the era
of rebellion came to an end in 1913 with
the breaking up of the Federation of Labor,
its advantages began to make themselves
clear. As Dr. Condliffe in his just-published
book, “The Making of New Zealand,” puts
it, the Commissioners “quickly developed
both skill and ability to gain public con-
fidence There is little doubt that this-
wise step taken in 1908 has been the salva-
tion of the arbitration system. It is re-
ported that in recent years the Conciliation
Councils Lave settled more than 90 per cent,
of disputes.” But, as eveiy Commissioner
warns the parties: “If you don’t settle the
point, the Court will, and you know more
about your trade than the Court does.”
Maoriland has saved its arbitration sys-
tem without any departure in principle
from the lines laid down by Reeves, its
founder. He insisted on compulsion as a
cardinal necessity, against the opposition of
the Conservatives and of such sturdy old
Liberals as Stout, who feared the law
would mean a “reversion from contract to
status”—an idea enlarged upon at a later
date by Belloc in “The Servile State.”
Another principle of the highest import-
ance which has been evolved is that,
preference to unionists must be a reward
reserved to those unions which loyally dis-
charge their responsibilities under the law.
If, as seems implicit in the Scullin amend-
ments to the Commonwealth Act, compul-
sion is to vanish and preference to unionists
is to become an unqualified right, the Com-
monwealth arbitration system will be a
watchdog without teeth. The strong, trucu-
lent unions may gain something; the
weaker unions, though very likely the most
deserving, will suffer.
And so certainly will the community.
For the essence of arbitration is the enforce-
ment of an equitable bargain; and attempts
to press down the balance on one side or
the other are foredoomed to failure.
A LAND POLICY FOR THE NEXT 20
YEARS.
The modern world had begun to treat its
farming lands very badly. There was a time
when what the crops took from the soil was
more or less returned to it by natural
manures. Then came mechanical haulage,
and the farmers’ “dung-heaps” dwindled as
motor-traction grew, until in many cases
they disappeared altogether.
Happily the chemist was at work in his
laboratory, and the science of soil analysis
has been developed enormously in the past
30 years. In this connection Australia had
one great stroke of good luck. Individual
areas have their own special needs for
special purposes, but generally it was found
that Australian soils lacked chiefly the
phosphates for which grain-cultivation
makes so heavy a call upon them. And
there were the world’s greatest known sup-
plies of phosphate rock awaiting exploita-
tion handily in the South Pacific—mainly
at Nauru and Ocean Island. The limit
of the profitable use of this fertiliser is still
a long way off. Twenty-five years ago
Jenkin Coles estimated that cultivation
with “super” had added a bushel of wheat
to the acre in South Australia. Professor
Richardson, of the Waite Research Insti-
tute, addressing the Science Congi’ess at
Brisbane, estimates the gain now at three
bushels to the acre. Yet “super” is hardly
more to the farm than the dose of castor
oil to the farmer’s household. There are
not many cases in which it will not do
some good; but there are plenty of cases in
which something else is indicated. Thus
the application of manganese to certain
lands in South Australia has given results
little short of miraculous in regard to both
quality and quantity of the wool clip.
An astounding feature of the situation is
that while the pastoral industry has done
amazing things in improving the breed of
its stock, and especially its sheep, it has
shown very little disposition to put the
achievements of chemical science to practi-
cal use: there are probably twice as many
men getting the best out of Australian
wheat lands as out of Australian grazing
lands. Even on the exceedingly fertile
North Coast of N. S. Wales there are
large areas over which neglected paspalum
is permitted to cumber the earth to the
total exclusion of infinitely more valuable
clovers and such like. What it is possible
to do in similar country used also for dairy-
ing purposes the North Island of Maoriland
is showing.
The truth is the vastness of our territory
has been a curse to us rather than a bless-
ing. Large areas being available, P 0 ® 1
farming methods have been almost universal
indeed, there was at one time a pronounced
distaste for everything in the shape ol
intensive cultivation—that was "Chinaman
farming.” The aim of what at one time
was the average farmer, and is still that of
the very frequent farmer, is a large area.
intensive cultivation is of far less conse-
quence than buying out old Smith next
door. The wretched financial showing of
our countiy railways is one direct conse-
quence of this rotten policy; for it is not
too much to say that if the lands in, say,
the Eastern and Central divisions of
N. S. Wales were producing as much as
science could make them profitably produce,
harvests of wool and wheat equal to the
present average could be won from half
the area now occupied. We have, however,
preferred to rely upon large areas, so that our
railways have no more than half the traffic
per mile they should carry. Thus the tax-
payer is left with a heavy burden, while
the freight bill of those who have been
pushed unnecessarily far out consumes one-
sixth of their entire crop.
For the next 20 years Australia ought to
concern itself very little with the opening
up of new lands, other perhaps than those
of the Far North. Our outstanding task is
to enormously increase the production from
lands already in occupation. In no other
way can we do so much to relieve ourselves
of the burden of our railways; in no other
way can we so effectively reduce the cost
of producing those staples on whose export
we depend to pay our interest bill—and at
the moment that is one of the most urgent
of all our problems.
THE NINE STATES OF AUSTRALIA.
Dear Bulletin, —The proposal re “A New
Federal Capital” (B. 28/5,/’3O) should not
be lost sight of. The recent Labor Con-
ference at Canberra introduced a number
of new people to the spot, and their
opinions were as bleak as the surroundings.
Ogilvie, K.C., leader of the Tasmanian
Labor party, was one more who threw in
his vote for abandonment on the best .terms
possible, and considering the prospects it
is difficult to arrive at any other view.
Sydney would have been the natural
capital of Australia, just as the great city
ports of Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Ayres
are the natural capitals of two other big
Federations. But narrow and blatant State
Frights politicians took their own view of
the matter. They were willing and anxious
that Sydney should be an Australian
metropolis provided it remained, and re-
mained first and foremost, a State metro-
polis and under State control. The Com-
monwealth was to have a bedroom in an
obscure corner. It was to have no place
where it could keep a military or naval
force, or any other of the customary appur-
tenances of sovereignty, except by State
permission.
There being a general demand that
Federated Australia should have a home
of its own, the next alternative of the anti-
Federal and State rights faction was to see
that it was provided with an unsuccessful
home, surrounded by the territory of one
State, and with no chance to grow into
even a second-rate town. Australia reversed
the policy of Frazil and Argentina, where
the Commonwealth occupies the principal
city and port and some adjacent territory
in full sovereignty, and the State to which
they appear to belong on the map has found
a political centre of its own suitable to its
circumstances.
There is plenty of time to repair the
blunder. Capitals are not necessarily per-
manent. Winchester was much older and
more historical than Canberra when the
English kings abandoned it for London, and
Toledo when it gave place to Madrid.
Should it come to pass that Sydney, with
500 or 600 square miles of adjacent terri-
tory, became a Federal centre, Australia
would be composed of nine States or Pro-
vinces (and have the hope of more when
Westralia and Queensland are subdivided),
with areas and populations, somewhat as
follows: —
Square Miles.
Victoria . . . . 87,884 1,777,065
Federal District (Sydney) 600 (about) 1,450,000
New South Wales . . 309,772 (about) 1,035,867
Queensland . . . . 670,500 930,871
South Australia . . 380,070 580,271
Westralia .. • • 975,920 416,763
Tasmania . . • • 26,215 219,066
North Australia . . 287,227 (about) 2,470
Central Australia . . 236,393 (about) 2,000
It is not proposed, of course, that the
Federal District should be disqualified as
a voting unit for the Federal Parliament.
That fad was adopted in the case of Can-
berra, in servile imitation of the Yankees
at Washington, and like many other servile
imitations it has been a failure. The in-
habitants should have full representation in
the House of Representatives, and in the
Senate the Federal District should rank as
an ordinary and full-blown State. But it
would have no State Legislature. The
capital of Australia being common pro-
perty, the common Parliament would
naturally legislate for its concerns. New
South Wales would have to provide itself
with its own metropolis, and it should be
stipulated that it be a reasonable distance
from Sydney to prevent the politics becom-
ing* mixed.
The consent of a majority of the States
would be required for such a change, and
the majority would have to include New
South Wales as the State to be subdivided.


NO SILLY NONSENSE ABOUT ’EM.
“In the new Arbitration Bill the Scullin Government proposes that Arbitration Judges shall be instructed not to take economic consequences into account when fixing hours
or wages.”
“What I likes about these ’ere Scullin blokes is there’s no blasted nonsense about them. They says we [?]ughter have beer when we want beer, whether we can pay
for it or not.”
It should be possible to count on Queens-
land, Victoria, South Australia, Westralia
and Tasmania, or most of them, they being
tired of Canberra, tired of subscribing to-
wards its foundation expenses, and not re-
garding it as much of a common asset in
comparison with Sydney. As regards the
vote of New South Wales, there are hopes
that the majority of 1,450,000, dazzled by
the prospect of their city becoming the
metropolis of a continent instead of a
mere abode of bad-tempered and _ abusive
local disturbances, would outweigh the
minority of 1,035,867, even if it included
Lang and all his satellites in their worst
frame of mind.-

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Shall Garden Be Lord Mayor?
In spite of its handicaps, the Commission
appointed to clean up the putrid mess
which Labor aldermen and the Municipal
Laborers’ Union had made of the city
of Sydney has accomplished a great deal.
The staff, which had been stuffed with Labor
aldermen’s friends, was reduced from 6304
at the beginning of 1928 to 5112 on Sept.
30, and there has been a very decided
improvement in service. The blackmailing
of contractors was stopped. On coal tend-
ers, which, as a Royal Commission reported,
were associated with long-standing corrup-
tion. savings estimated at £41,000 were
effected, and general savings, for which
chapter and verse are given, are reckoned
at £386,022 to the end of December. Then
the electricity department, which showed a
loss of £22,000 in 1927, the last Labor year,
returned a profit of £200,000 in 1929. This
is the concern that was the special prey of
Labor aldermen and their friends; Maling,
the assistant general manager, extorted (or
at least received) a bribe of £lO,OOO from a
contractor for power plant, and swore that
lie gave £7500 to a Labor alderman to
share with other Labor aldermen.
Now the Commissioners are packing up,
for an election will be held next week. The
('lectors have had no say in the nomination
of candidates; that work has been done for
them by a few obliging individuals on either
side. The A.L.P. executive, which chose
the Labor lot, did not dare to endorse the
ex-aldermen named in the Maling case
and the coal-contract inquiry, but it is run-
ning Garden, the Moscow repudiationist,
who is to be Lord Mayor if the Communist-
Labor ticket wins. In that case, as Garden
lias announced, “it is going to be spoils to
the victors with a vengeance.” The Com-
munist-Labor policy is “work for the work-
less I do not care a fig where the money
comes from, but we will get it.” Other
Communist-Labor candidates have publicly
promised “to absorb thousands who are now
unemployed.” This can only mean, in the
first place, loans floated at ruinous interest,
or crippling rates, leading to still greater
unemployment. The ratepayers are much
to blame for letting Tammany run riot in
1924-27. If they have learned nothing from
that evil administration and the decent, if
humdrum, regime which succeeded it; if
they have so little regard for their interests
and so little feeling for their city as to
allow Garden and his basher-gang ruffians
to capture Sydney, they will deserve all that
will be coming to them.

Brand Your Goods!
Unless the Federal Government passes a
law requiring Australian goods to carry the
name of the manufacturer, the tariff will
fail to do a great deal of what it should do
for Australian industry.
Take boots as an example. In some
States there is a local law obliging the
manufacturer to put his name on his wares
—a law passed not to do something for the
manufacturer, but for the protection of the
wearer against shoddy. In consequence of
this law, in those States where it operates
the Australian maker of high-class shoes
gets full credit for his wares. Consequently,
unless he is hopelessly prejudiced against
Australian goods, a person in one of those
States never dreams of assuming that only
the poor-quality shoe is made in Australia.
But in N. S. Wales, where there is no law
obliging the manufacturer to brand his pro-
duct, the manufacturer is often required to
put the retailer’s name on the high-class
shoe; the poor stuff he can brand with his
own name if he likes. So whether he
deserves it or not the N. S. Wales boot
manufacturer has the reputation of turning
out shoddy, while the Victorian is admit-
ted to be quite a good man at his business.
Much the same thing is happening with
regard to most other lines. So long as the
manufacturer is not required by law to
brand his goods, so long will there be
retailers who will require him to put their
names on lines which they think will do
them credit. Thus the Australian manufac-
turer is worse than unadvertised: he is
advertised only or chiefly by his second-
grade goods.
Australia has suffered from this sort _ of
thing for 50 years—long before Federation
arrived. Her operatives were always re-
garded as crude, until an Australian brand
on an article almost damned it. There is
not a retailer in Australia who is unaware
of the difficulty of selling anything Aus-
tralian to some of his customers; there are
hundreds of traders who have sold Aus-
tralian goods to these customers as French
or English or American, helped thereto by
the fact that the article was unbranded;
and every such transaction has been a
wrong done to Australia. The Federal Gov-
ernment has a chance such as never before
presented itself of altering all that. It
can require all Australian goods to be
branded. Thus Australia will get the credit
for its good goods and will be discouraged
from producing bad. And it will enable
the manufacturer—the small manufacturer
in particular—to build up a goodwill with
whose assistance he may be able to carry
on even if at some future date a Govern-
ment less Australian than the present should
succeed to office and proceed to play ducks
and drakes with the tariff.

Trade with Maonland.
In the early days of colonisation Maoriland
drew practically all her imports fiom or
through Australia, and as late as 1862 the
proportion was 60 per cent. The rate has
fallen more or less steadily in the interim
till last year it was only a shade over 8 per
cent., and foi the first time m the tiading
history of the two countries their accounts
with each other practically balanced. From
1914 to 1928 inclusive the balances in Aus-
tralia’s favor aggregated £26,600,000 in re-
spect of goods of Australian origin, and
£35,600,000 in respect of all goods shipped
from Australian ports, an average of
£2,100,000 a year to the Commonwealth’s
credit.
Not a great deal has been done to foster
this profitable trading relationship between
Australia and her nearest neighbor. From
the inauguration of the Commonwealth
to the end of 1921 Maoriland admitted Aus-
tralian goods at British Preferential tariff
rates, whereas Maoriland goods entering
Australia were dutiable under the General
tariff as applied to foreigners. In Decern-
ber, 1921, Maoriland retaliated by putting
Australian goods on her General tariff list,
and within nine months a reciprocal treaty
was made—a complicated affair, arrived at
after much negotiation. The arrangement
has worked fairly smoothly, but the decreas-
ing trade is in part, at least, a measure of
the Dominion’s growing dissatisfaction with
the bargain.
The amiable Mr. Fenton is to be sent
across the Tasman to put things on a better
basis, and he should not have a very diffi-
cult task. Such dissatisfaction as exists on
the other side, is almost wholly centred on
Australian restrictions on such farm produce
as butter, potatoes, onions and oats. These
are widely fluctuating items, dependent of
couise, on the needs of Australia and the
ability or otherwise of Australian farmers
to supply those needs The biggest ship-
ments m recent years have been £74 ,900
worth of butter in 1927, £152,000 worth of
potatoes m 1926, £9300 worth of onions m
the in sa “ e r and £88,500 worth of oats
1927l 927 - .The average yearly shipment of
all four items for the six years ended 1928
was only £325,700 not worth making a
fuss over with a customer whose purchases
from us in the period averaged five millions
a vear. If Maoriland could be mollified
over these items she might admit Australian
, , )• i , u„,.; nrr
wheat, which her balers mast on having
on more advantageous terms than those at
present, m toice.

Freetrade and Low Wages.
It is some time since the Commonwealth
had a definite Freetrade leader of the
George Reid stamp, and the lack of one
became more than usually conspicuous when
Scullin and Co. began to do things. So that
disastrous financier ex-Treasurer Page
apparently decided to take over the billet,
the only one available.
A formal statement which he issued to
the press_told various tales of the familiar
brand. For example:—
« Bcfore Federation Hoskins and Co. were
able to secure the tender for the Coolgardie
water supply, one of the biggest jobs of its
kind in the world, in open competition with
t }le rest of the world, and made all their own
fr° n PlP es in Australia. Before the war
H. V. McKay and Co. were able to export
agricultural machinery to the Argentine. To-
day, with duties multiplied many times,
McKay’s are no longer able to do this. We
are no longer able to compete with the rest
of the world in the open market with our
other products.”
It is a pity Dr. Page and his kind don’t
come into the open and honestly denounce
high wages. In 1909, which seems to be as
far Back as complete statistics go, the aver-
a § e wa § e paid in factories (the places where
ir ° n PTes and agricultural machinery and
°ther things are made) was £B3 per worker
P er ann P. r P; 1913, just before the war,
P cr annum - Bast year it was
over £205 per annum. At the same time the
fact stands out that in 1903 502 persons out
of every 10,000 inhabitants had jobs m
factories, in 1913 702 per 10,000, m 1928
'45 per 10,000. Thus, it Australia got back
0 ,e cheap ways of 1903, when the Kal-
"ooyip- water scheme was opened, it looks
a f “ mean sacking 243 people out
0 evei ’y 10,000 inhabitants,
But, then, a medical man or a lawyer can
afford, to take a more lofty and dispassion-
ate view of fiscal matters than a manufac-
turer who employs Australian labor. Neither
P e [^ c nor legal opinions are imported,
m hu *k or otherwise.

THROUGHOUT HER LONG, LONE FLIGHT
MISS AMY JOHNSON USED SHELL SPIRIT
POLITICAL
POINTS
The new powers which N.S.W. Railway
Commissioner Cleary was to receive in order
that he might put the lines on a more sol-
vent basis have been so whittled down as
a concession to the Country party that the
position promises to be pretty much where it
was. Cleary gave up his place as boss of
a nice warm brewery, where there wag a
pleasant odor of malt instead of a stench of
bankrupt engine grease, and took the train
job at his old salary, though he could have
had more. Then he surrendered half his
pay as an act of charity. He is assured,
however, that he will have his reward in
Heaven —provided it isn’t crowded out when
he arrives.
“To avert wholesale dismissals” or “to
avoid having to pay compensation which
might run into six figures” (both reasons
are semi-officially given), the work of the
permanent staff of the C.M.F. is to be
rationed. T,wo-tliirds of them will have to
take liberal holidays in 1930-31 without pay
—for eight weeks in 894 cases. It is vaguely
understood that the training of the new
volunteer army will continue in a sort of
fashion, but perhaps training will be
rationed, too. The scheme does not apply to
the Defence Department clerks. They belong
to the union and so are immeasurably more
important than mere soldiers.
Commanded to attend Melbourne Trades
Hall and explain why he isn’t withdrawing
the police so that the union may drive the
volunteers off the wharves, Vic. Premier
Hogan bluntly refused, saying that Goddard,
the union president, was responsible for the
continuance of the wharf strike in 1928,
and so for the unionists’ present plight.
He added that if the T.II. council w;anted to
make any further representations his official
address was the Premier’s office. Hogan
went to the Chamber of Commerce banquet
instead and brought down the house with a
speech in which he bespoke the co-operation
of employers in lifting the State out of the
slough. Responsibility has made- a different
man of the erstwhile destructive critic from
Ballan.
Garden has explained frankly that if he
and his “Labor” associates recover muni-
cipal control of Sydney they will return, not
with a view to governing the city well, but to
provide billets for their supporters. All the
1.790 superfluous employees whom the Com-
missioners dispensed with are to be rein-
stated, and Garden says the necessary money
PROSPECTIVE COMMUNIST LABOR LORD MAYOR:
“What about lending us a jew million
before we nationalise credit?"
will be got somehow, whether anybody will
lend it or not. It seems very like a looting
expedition pure and simple.
During the S. Aus. election campaign
Butler, then Premier, was blamed for the
deficit and the depression, also for the low
price of dried fruits and the drought. Butter-
field, Labor member for Newcastle and
former Minister, has since told a Pleasant
Sunday Afternoon meeting in Adelaide’s
Botanic Park that Butler was no more
responsible for the depression than Premier
Hill is, and that “wages must fall.” It is
confidently predicted now that something will
happen to Butterfield.
Russia had a railway catastrophe, in which
45 people were fatally fizzled up and 23
injured, on April 16, but though the pyro-
technic display happened only 20 miles from
Moscow the affair was kept out of the papers
till May 30. That was something like cap-
able censorship. But in the published re-
ports of the killed and damaged on Australian
lines the year 1924 still remains a blank
so far as Queensland is concerned. It is
simply stated that figures are “not avail-
able,” and the total is described as “incom-
plete.” It was the year of the big smash,
and the Labor Cabinet seems to have buried
the victims secretly.
Canberra proudly announced the 1 other
day tha*t its army of public servants had
decided to contribute a penny in the pound
of their weekly salaries to an unemployment
fund, and the ratepayers of Lane Cove,
Sydney, grinned. They are giving the local
council a shilling a week each for the same
purpose, in addition to meeting the State
income tax and unemployment tax (3d. in
the £) from which Canberra* is exempt.
And not a few of them are State public
servants whose salaries are to be reduced by
one-twelfth. At bottom the Cans, are pro-
bably just as good-natured as the Coves,
but living in a bleak village with grandiose
pretensions a*nd brooding on the grievance
of having to be there at all are apt to blur
one’s sense of the fitness of things.
As the Vic. rural
Nationalists are keen
upon non-Labor unity,
the Country party has
renewed its invitation to
them to come in. With
a party of 22, capture of
Dunstan’s Country Pro-
gressive four would be
easier, and the A Han-
cocks could count on sup-
port from the six met-
ropolitan Nats, and pos-
sibly from Jimmy Me-
Lachlan, the North
Gippsland Independent.
Such a combine as this
might mean the Premier-
ship for John Allan
again; he had it for 21
years (1924-27). John
is no statesman, but he
has a knack of getting
his own way when he
asserts himself.
The present disturb-
ance between Church
and State in Malta is
a curiously ill-selected affair. The Church
ordered a certain priest, as its spiritual
subject, to leave Malta, his native
island, assumedly because it objected to
his politics. The Prime Minister, N.S.W.’s
one-time Governor Strickland, replied that
the reverend gentleman was the tem-
poral subject of the British Empire, and that
it said he needn’t go. Then the Church ex-
communicated the priest, and added a broad
hint that Strickland should go also. It
dropped a half-interdict on his party, and
forbade people to read his paper. The Pope
has become a recognised temporal sovereign
ruling over 109 acres of ground, but the tem-
poral status doesn’t come into the case.
Minister Green has obligingly offered to
sound the Indian Government as to employ-
ing some of the Australian n.c.o.’s whom his
party’s calamitous defence “policy” has left
iobless. That sort of emigration would be a
lasting disgrace to the Scullidores, but it is
not likely to happen. -Time-expired British
soldiers clamor for employment in India
rather than return to their homeland. The
great railway companies appoint men of this
class —especially if they are sappers—to gang
supervision work, but thousands are turned
away regretfully every year. Minister Green
ought to be aware of this, but he has every-
thing to learn about his billet; and he is
rising 61.
Union after union is quitting the Com-
munist-controlled Sydney Trades and Labor
Council; the Clothing Trades organisation,
3090 strong, is the latest. The. Clothing
Traders draw the line at contributing to the
expenses of three Reds to go to Moscow and
“study the economic position.” A true report
wouldn’t interest the union, nor a lying one
either, and the lying one is the more pro-
bable. Australia can’t afford to send money
abroad to pay for unnecessary imports,
whether they are Communist opinions or
beer.
Sydney Trades and Labor Council can
always preserve a show of “affiliated” unions
and Red delegates while the Pump-Menders’
Association and the Horse-shoe Half-solers’
combination and similar bodies remain true
to their salt. But these bodies are not rich,
and hig combinations with money for trips
to Moscow tend to fall away. Among these
which have left, besides the Clothing Trades,
are the A.W.U., the Printing Industry Em-
ployees, the Waterside Workers, the Water
and Sewerage men and the Furnishing
Trades. They are willing to return if Jock
Garden and his heelers leave, but Jock would
much rather stay on in an empty house
than be chucked out of a full one. Until
the office keyhole is actually seized for debt
there is always hope.
There has been a significant increase in
the French-African military establishment.
Refused the Rhine frontier, and the Anglo-
American guarantee to which Wilson and
Lloyd George agreed, France feels that it
will have to fight a German war of revenge
without allies; so the country that pat
SOO.OOO blacks into the firing-line against
Fritz and his friends is prepared to go
further. It is natural enough, considering
the 1814, 1870 and 1914 invasions, but his-
tory shows that a nation which buys mer-
cejiaries is in turn the prey of those
mercenaries. The prospect of the bene-
gambian nigger becoming a power in Lurope
is not comforting.
Melbourne tramways, which are staggering
under the burden of motor competition, have
had to hand over £29,700 to consolidated
revenue as their contribution to fire brigades,
hospitals and the like. This makes over a
million pounds so contributed in a decade,
and Cameron, head of the Tramway Board,
is loud in his protestations. Nobody has
satisfactorily explained what trams have to
do with fire brigades or infectious diseases,
but there are lots of things in Melbourne
politics which call for satisfactory explana-
tion.

A senior lineman at Ipswich (Q.) was
fined £2 by the Postal Workers’ Union for
refusing to supply it with departmental in-
formation which lie' is bound not to give.
The Nationalists took up his case (they
usually let victims of this sort of tyranny
fight their own battles), and Postmaster-
General Lyons told the arrogant union bosses
it wouldn’t do. The matter was raised in
the House, and it led to a discussion on the
Government's efforts to force all public ser-
vants to join unions. “Hansard” (page -11;>)
reports the head of the Government as fol-
lows :
[These] plaintive appeals on behalf of non-
unionists are simply part of a vendetta against the
public service organisations, at whose hands the
party opposite met its fate at the last election.
Scullin has had eight predecessors, and they
were a mixed lot; but not one of them ever
said, or had any reason for saying, that he
owed his high position to the Postal W orkers
Union and other public service organisations,
much less suggested that it wa*s something to
be proud of.
At a Church of Christ conference in Syd-
ney Davey Hall, Holman’s old political col-
league, put in a kindly word for Communism,
as a Scriptural institution. He quoted from
the Book of Acts: —
And the multitude of them that believed were of
one heart and one soul; neither said any of them
that aught of the things which he possessed was
his own; but they had all things in common....
Neither was there any among them that lacked;
for as many as were possessed of lands, or houses
sold them 'and brought the prices of .the things
that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles
feet, and distribution was made unto every man
according as he had need.
But the story is disappointing, for it runs
to only 16 verses, and 10 of them are taken
up with the premature deaths of Mr. and
Mrs. Ananias on a charge of bilking the
common treasury. The name is given of
one man who sold his allotment and paid
up honestly, but one swallow doesn’t make
much of a summer, or much of a fund
either.
Much was made during the last few weeks
of the coal trouble of the fact that for a
year the miners of the South Coast and
Lithgow and Broken Hill had been parting
up 2s. 6d. in the £ of their pay. It was
regarded as something colossal —and so it
was. Yet for years past thousands of poorer
people than many of these miners have been
paying 3s. and more in the £_ through the
tax on the earnings of companies on which
they are dependent. And there is no relief
for them in sight—and won’t be until public
services can be made to pay and administra-
tive exes, are reduced by one-third.

The Wheat Marketing Bill got through the
House of Reps, amid an atmosphere of sus-
picion ; in fact, suspicion seemed to grow as
time went on. It was mentioned that if 4s.
clear is guaranteed to the farmer, which
means 4s. 9d. or so at port of shipment, there
will probably be a big bill to pay, especially
as the U.S.A. is reported to have an unpre-
cedented pile of unsold grain left from last
harvest. Each State is to meet half the loss,
if any, on its own crop, and that doesn’t
appeal to Westralia, which last season had
36 p.c. of the Australian crop and only 7 p.c.
of the taxpayers. A voluntary pool operates
in Westralia, along with private buyers, and
lots of farmers prefer this arrangement to
a compulsory pool plus a guarantee, portion
of which guarantee may be dragged from
them in the form of income tax. Also, at a
time when capital is. scarce it seems folly to
dam up the source represented by the buyers
and depend altogether on funds raised by
the Commonwealth Bank, especially when —
if Canadian and U.S.A. experience is any
criterion —large quantities of wheat may have
to be held indefinitely. Opposition to the
Scullidore scheme is growing in all the wheat

“10-2-4”: This unemployment problem has
me baffled. I know there are thousands out
of work in Sydney; most of them have bor-
rowed money from me. But when it comes
to getting work for money—well, here are a
few recent experiences:—
Attempt to get cool: at 30s. a week.
(1) Slatternly young woman, alleged to be French
cook, reported for duty. After two nights food-
SOMETHING WAS DOING IT, ANYHOW.
MOTHER: "Don’t jump about like that, pet. You only make mother worse sick when
you rock the boat.”
mining asked for £1 advance, got it, and never
turned up again.
(2) Aged lady, resembling stage duchess, took
over. Much given to discussing her relations—
members, one and all, of the higher nobility, such
as solicitors and dentists. Rotten cook. Showed
signs of surliness. Complained to wife that she
“was used to being treated as one of the family”
and that I treated her “like a dog”—though I had
never voluntarily addressed her. Resigned un-
expectedly one night when we had friends coming.
(3) Middle-aged woman marched in. Red-faced,
noisy, loquacious. Proud that both sons had dodged
compulsory service. Good cook. Seen throwing hot
water over our inoffensive cat, and sacked. Found
later blind drunk, drenching my desk with tears.
Had to pay for removalist taxi and help to shove
her into it with neighbors looking on.
Attempt to get small car and garage cleaned -
chiefly on account of grease on garage floor.
Breezy lad covered with oil blew in, ran car
out of garage backwards and jambed mudguard
against wheel of stationary bottle-oh cart. Drenched
garage with water, but left grease as on arrival.
Fee, 15s.
Attempt to get small plumbing job done in bath-
room.
Immigrant plumber estimated job would cost
“between thirty bob and two quid.” At hint that
this was excessive said proudly “I’m no slave,” and
left.
At present I am trying to organise a Non-
Lenders’ Union (one that will declare me.
“black” for life if I lend a farthing, and give
me a badge or ticket to prove it) in the
intervals of plumbing, garage-cleaning ar.o
helping in the kitchen. It seems the only
answer to the ruthless hammer-blows of tne
Borrowers’ and Unemployed Unions.

“Percy Pawnticket”: Mrs. Malaprop was
a delegate to a recent temperance gathering
of her sex. A lady had declared that it
would be a* fine thing if young women could
he induced to decline marriage with drink-
ing men, giving point to her words by recit-
ing the old verse in which the girl vows that
lips that have tasted wine will never touch
hers. Mrs. Malaprop supported her, but
wanted to go further. “Let this be the motto
of our girls,” she suggested: “‘I will kiss no
lips that 'have cigarette stains on their
lingers.’ ” Prolonged applause.

“X.S ”: There was a flutter in the Fitz-
roy (Vic.) court when a one-legged man on
crutches was fined for riding a too-vociferous
motor-cycle. The constable confessed that
he had doubts as to whether accused was the
right person; the man he had arrested was
indubitably two-legged. The Bench looked
puzzled, but all ivas made clear when the
motor-bike rider explained that he had an
artificial leg which he had left at home.

“Smilax” : The women of Western Queens-
land are not far behind their southern sis-
ters in climbing into man-made positions.
I recently heard a feminine J.P. sentence
the township ne’er-do-well to 24 hours tor
obscene language. She gave it to him hot
and strong, enlarging eloquently on the
plight of his poor wife and children.
The lady took care to preserve one privilege
of her sex —she had the last word.

“G.M.” : From the moment we left. Fre-
mantie Australian money became worthless
on board the Esperance Bay. The com-
pany issued books of coupons, charging Is.
6d.‘in the pound exchange; apart tram
English notes and silver this was the only
legal tender. Every penny the ship’s barber
took lie examined carefully; “they try to
swindle me with Australian money,

niglit because a man had passed off an Aus-
tralian florin for four English sixpences. It
was a good fight, but the whole business is
humiliating to Australians.

“G.P.E.”: In the carriage were a dignified
matron with four youngsters at an active
stage of convalescence. When the train
stopped at a country station a man dashed in
and took possession of the one unoccupied
seat. Madam glared at him, "I must warn
you,” she said coldly, “that mai children
are recovering from whooping-cough. You
would be waise—very waise—to choose
anothah carriage!” “Can’t be ’elped, lady,’
he replied breezily; “there’s only another
vacant seat, an’ that’s nex’ to a ’oneymoon
couple. I’d rather ’ave the ’oopin’-cough.”

goes to New England he will have to mind
his p’s and q’s if he dines at a certain bush
ANOTHER PROFESSOR BOWLED OUT.

pub. Another distinguished Englishman
called at the place for lunch, and the pro-
prietress, a stout lady of Irish extraction,
waited upon him herself. “Roast beef or-r
por-rk?” she demanded. “Madam,” he
smiled, “I’m a thorough Englishman.” “An’
who said y’ wus a Chinaman?” the lady
retorted. “Roast beef o-r por-rk?”

“Karaways”: A neighbor of mine makes
a hobby of fortune-tellers; a working-
woman, with three children dependent
upon her. she spends no money on
picture shows or amusements of a>ny kind,
but once a week she visits a clairvoyant, a
crystal-reader, a palmist, or a reader of hands
or cards. The fees paid range from a
shilling to a crown. Presumably the higher
they arc the better the seer's powers, for
Mrs. Next-door tolls me she is longing for
the day when she can afford a ten and six-
penny consultation. “But do these people
benefit you in any way?” I asked. I should
think so!” was her enthusiastic rejoinder,
“Whv. a palmist, an astrologer and a clair-
voyant have all told me I am to inherit a
large fortune next year. Think of having
that to look forward to!’ I left her to her
dreams.

“Schlagerfest”: The German Surgery
Society has protested against a new clause
in the penal code forbidding the traditional
duelling contests among university students.
It points out that lighting is less
dangerous than boxing, which is steadily
growing in vogue j and theic is a lot m the
contention. The be-bolstered, »
schlager fighter has only the top of Ins lie
and portion of his face vulnerable. It n
impossible to hit with the heavily-padded
sword-arm, all the strokes and parries bem»
made with the wrist, while only the exposed
parts of the head are permitted as targets.
Surgeons are always in attendance, and tne
scrap is stopped as soon as a hit is made
until the wound has been dressed. Ihe
students’ custom of removing dressings as
soon as possible in order to cultivate the
ugly yet honorable scars most of us have
seen on German faces is responsible for the
occasional fatal cases of blood poisoning.

“F.J.G.” : Although it was at Glenelg that
Governor Ilindmarsli landed from the Buf-
falo 94 years ago to proclaim South Aus.
a colony, the seaside place has no thorough-
fare or public building bearing either of
these historic names. It evidently considers
the jetty, built over 60 years ago, more
Avortiiy of commemoration; the street lead-
ing to the jetty is called Jetty-road; a neigh-
boring pub is called the Pier Hotel; and
there is a Pier-street. Glenelg could atone
for its remissness and at. the same time
emphasise its intimate connection with the
founding of the State by erecting a statue
of H'indmarsh on the fine approach to the
jetty ‘ * * * *
“Hops-and-Scotch”: Ross Smith’s arrival
at Sydney by air was much more thrilling
than Amy Johnson's. I was on top of
the old Sydney “D.T.” building the day
the Smith ’plane came over the city. The
birdmen dropped some circulars for charit-
able purposes. “How sweet!” cried a darl-
ing near me; “they're throwing out con-
fetti!"
% * * *
“Beauclerk”: The Johnsonian Club in
Brisbane is putting up the shutters. Founded
in the ’seventies —Brunton Stephens was an
original member—the club grew into a
centre of hospitality for eminent visitors,
and not only writers and artists. In my
day it entertained celebrities so far apart
in their callings as Kubelik and Sandow,
while its literary guests ranged from David
Christie Murray to Bryce. The hospitality
was of the good old Queensland type, though
some of the great men didn’t remember much
about it when they got up next afternoon.
Its passing is regretted, but there is no
place for literary clubs in these days of
motor-cars, picture-papers, bridge and the
talkies.
* * * =!=
“Super-Gun”: To wind up the argument
about Fritz’s Big Berthas, seven were made ;
one exploded prematurely. The guns required
enormous emplacements and each tipped the
scales at about 200 tons. The shells, how-
ever, were relatively small, weighing only
264 pounds; the bore was smooth, as they
turned themselves. The trajectory of the
guns was 24 miles high. After each shot
accurate calculations had to be made of the
temperature of powder and gun ; even the cur-
vature of the earth was very carefully figured.
From March to August, 367 shots were fired
at Paris from a distance of about 75 miles.
“No Gent”: The almost insuperable dif-
ficulty of being a gentleman was interestingly
evidenced by one Frederick Howard in an
article on “Redheap.” He quoted Cardinal
Newman’s famous definition :
He never mistakes personalities or sharp sayings
for arguments his disciplined intellect preserves
him from blundering- discourtesy.
Having thus demonstrated that he had the
right idea, Frederick proceeded to call Lind-
say “a lavatory scribbler,” “a spoilt child
with nothing important to say,” the posses-
sor of “an inflated reputation,” and “a small-
boy novelist” deserving of “a kick in tin-
pants.” In private life Fred is probably a
mild old gentleman who would hesitate to
raise his foot to a strange dog discovered Li-
the act of devouring the picnic sandwiches.
But controversy makes politicians of us all.
I can’t think of one public man in Australia
(the officially silenced classes excepted) who
bears the slightest resemblance to a gentle-
man as set forth in the classic definitions.
What would the late Archbishop of Canter-
bury have thought of Opposition-leader Lang
in action? Or Premier Bavin? Imagination
boggles at the thought.

r,o,.^^ ena^ e 'i : , young woman whose
parents had been misguided enough to
christen her Cinderella has figured in a
Sydney divorce-court case. It was a story
ot sackcloth and ashes without any fairv
godmother to cheer the proceedings; but there
was a prince, and he spoke his piece in the
■witness-box. The prince had not waited for
any glass-slipper business; he said he was
merely a laborer, but he worked hard, and
havmg found Cinder a good missus during
the two years he had lived with her, he was
prepared to get the Church’s blessing if a
divorce were granted, her husband being
worse than two wicked sisters. In the
circumstances the Court waived its scruples
and untied the knot.

“Macgee”: Enterprising spirits in our
{sydney suburb are not troubled over-much
because depression brought them the sack,
iwo young fellows arrived at our house with
buckets, mops and cloths, and offered to
clean the outside of all the windows for
tenpepce. A.s it’s a job every housewife
abominates, they were engaged, and in a
few minutes, having set to work as if their
lives depended on it, the pair walked off a
shilling richer, the missus explaining that
it would be mean to haggle about tuppence
with two decent youngsters who were trying
to make the best of bad times. Subsequent
inquiry revealed that both our neighbors had
been similarly moved to two-penn’orth of

generosity; and I have no doubt those
toilers are earning more than the basic wage.
Another battler found himself with no job
and a half-paid-for t.-p. car., His inspira-
tion was a direct car sendee to the nearest
station. In a fortnight he had a second
car on the run; in two months a good-sized
char-a-banc. Now he’s making bigger money
than he dreamed of in the old days—and
making it with a fraction of the old effort.
* * * *
■‘X2M”: If the march of science has
evolved a more scientific process of “pickling”
Chinamen than that of formalin injections,
it is not in use at sea. The fee of £2O
mentioned by “Sea Nomad” (B. 9/4/’3O)
and “Dr. Nil” (B. 7/5/’3O) remains the
same, but it is divided equally between the
chief officer and the surgeon. ' In the event
of the defunct one being a pauper, as is often
the case, the money is collected by the
bos’n from the crew and passengei’s, and
no allowance is made by the company.
Evidence of the financial depression was
brought to light recently when a wise chief
officer demanded the money before proceeding
with the job. “No have got!” said the
bos n. "Right,” replied the mate, “no ca<tchee,
no havee! We’ll dump him over the side!”
A few minutes later a breathless bos’n
appeared with the dollars. Kwang now
sleeps in an honorable grave, but doctors
and chief officers of the line have received
a circular from H.Q. directing that, in
future cases, pressure must not be brought
to bear if the £2O is not forthcoming.

“Hamer”: Now that the Lennox Bridge
at Parramatta is to go, Australian anti-
quarians will demand that the name of the
great pioneer bridge-builder be given to one
of his other structures—the Lansdowne
bridge over Prospect Creek, still in good use.
although it was opened early in 1836, is
one. In the old toll days this bridge was a
good revenue-earner, netting £034 in 1843
and £685 the next year. Lennox was
appointed Superintendent of Bridges in 1832
at a salary of £l2O, and there was no go-
slow about him and his convict gangs. The
Lapstone Hill bridge took a mere six months,
and the Lansdowne, with all its heavy stone-
work, only a little over a year.
* -i= * *
“Dropper”: The cabled story of the Aus-
tralian cricketers’ failure to catch trout
during their stay in Hampshire made fiy-
fisiiermen grin. The two rivers flowing into
Southampton Water, the Test and the
Itchen, are inhabited by trout of great size
with the wisdom of a thousand years behind
them. These streams are sacred to the
superior person who fishes with a dry fly;
anyone attempting to employ a wet fly, a
worm or a minnow in one of them is never
heard .of again. It is some comfort to hear
that Kelly, the manager, carried back some
fisli caught by his host. That host was
Heseltine, one of the world’s acknowledged
experts in dry-fly fishing.
* * * *
“Verri”: There are lots of ways of seeing
the sights of a big city. A Melbourne
couple chose, an inexpensive method when
they left their boarding-house and sought a
near-by land-agent’s office. To him they
explained that they were a newly-married
pair from Victoria, seeking a domicile in a
pleasant suburb. She fancied Bondi while
he had an inclination towards .Coogee, and
in the agent’s ear they thoroughly “did” both
localities. Then they went farther afield,
motoring round the outer suburbs under the
same satisfactory, conditions. One agent
ran them some miles out to a newly-opened
area where they boiled a billy and had tea
before returning. As the real-estate busi-
ness is dull,, they found the whole tribe of
agents obliging. On their return to Mel-
bourne after a fortnight’s sojourn in Syd-
ney they had the satisfaction of knowing
they had thoroughly inspected Bavin’s city
and its environs, the expenses being borne
by the land-shark industry.

“Bill O’C.”: The dealers in faked pictures
a*re roughly m two classes. One lot are the
brassy liars, with their assurances and epis-
tolary proofs of very private purchases from
Lord Hardupp, and a liberal use of “we
guarantee.” If you are tempted to buy you
are liable to see another “work” of
the same artist displayed in the win-
dow a day or so later. The other sort
is more subtle. I met a sample of him
in New York, where I saw what looked
a lovely little flower-piece with the name
Fantin Latour” boldly displayed on the
frame. I inquired the price from the gentle-
man inside. “If you’ve got two hundred

“Pinkenbah”: Brisbane Customs officers
made another interesting haul the other day.
PURELY EDUCATIONAL.
“Dear, what do you men really mean by a cert?”
“A cert is the horse you bet on.”
“Then what’s a dead cert?”
“Oh, that’s what you lose on.”
It was all in one lump, and the sophisti-
cated finders agreed that the owner must
have been a person of catholic tastes. The
swag held 10 bottles of vermouth, 8 of
whisky, 2 of gin, 100 cigarettes, 100 cigars,
1 set of silk pyjamas, 2 silk kimonos and
1 silk nightgown. A perfect cocktail party
wrecked.

“Buna”: It’s our policy to give a day’s
work to one of the unemployed when we
can, so when the ancient with the battered
straw-hat arrived with a pitiful tale we
engaged him to weed
the garden. “Lady,”
he said solemnly,
“it’ll be weeded like
it never was before.”
We believed him an
hour afterwards when
we went out to inves-
tigate, and discovered
that he had cleaned
up a side bed, includ-
ing a violet border
that had been our
pride for years.
“Vi’lits,” he said
when our protests
arose, “ain’t ’ealthy
things to have around
an ’ouse. Too smelly.”
Someone was deputed
to watch him after
that, and again
sounds of altercation
disturbed the domestic
calm. This time it
was a rose-bush—a
worthless variety, he
maintained, though,
according to cata-
logue, it was the very
latest and most expen-
sive. At this point
we produced his w r age
and told him he
had done enough for
one afternoon. He
was reluctant to go.
“I’ll probberly come around ter-morrer and
finish up,” he said as he departed. It
entailed an early morning for the family,
but as he did not appear we had a peaceful
replanting of his uprooted specimens.

“Centurion”: Amy Johnson has been
made a* C.8.E., and women are indignantly
protesting that she will rank as inferior to
the land-agents and pony racecourse pro-
prietors who adorn that order. Still authority
didn’t thrust the 0.8. E. on the lady,
so things might have been worse. I know
three Light Horsemen who were reduced to
begging a Great Personage’s permission to
decline the 0.8. E. One of them was so dis-
gusted when offered the pinchbeck gaud—
the D.S.O. was due to him, but it was
collared by his Brig.—that he made his
sentiments known in lurid terms. He was
denied all further promotion in the A.I.F.

“Piecrust” : Nowadays the city youngster
with his soapbox on wheels often brings

round Melbourne’s fruit and fish markets.
They keep a sharp eye on the gutters, and
it doesn’t take long to get a boxful that
only needs a good wash to be palatable.
Cabbage-growers left with small stuff often
give a couple for the asking, and waste
leaves may be had by the ton. It is at
fuel-gathering, though, that the small boy
really shines. The foreshores are combed regu-
larly, and when the City Council recently
relaid a long stretch of wood-paved road and
gave notices that the old blocks could be had
for the cartage, the competition produced
brisk fights. A good deal of cement paving
and similar work is being done in Melbourne,
and the paper bags which have come into
fashion for cement are eagerly sought after.
And on Sunday the outer-suburban urchin
gets up at dawn and prospects about the
local hall for the bottles of the night before.

“C.Q.”: Virtue was its own reward in the
case of a Melbourne milkman who light-
heartedly asked an inspector he happened to
pass on his rounds to examine his milk.
Satisfied with the ability of his cows to fulfil
all requirements of the law, he watched the
official take a specimen from the bottom of
a nearly-empty can. He got a shock when
he received a summons for selling milk below
standard, which resulted in a fine of £1 and
three guineas costs. The conscientious ven-
dor hadn’t bargained for the fact that the
dregs of a can are bound to be impoverished.

“Morita”: In a village we camped in for
the night on the way to Lagnicourt there was
not one complete house. Another crowd
had grabbed the best of the battered dwell-
ings and had just stoked up the fire wffien
the whole show went up—one of Fritz’s
delayed-action mines. The mob frantically
tore. away the wreckage, locating the first
victim by strings of curses coming up through
the broken brickwork. Uncovering his head
and shoulders was the best they could do for
him whilst they dug out heavy beams and
the like, and he was wedged upright, with
only his top portion showing. “Stick a fag
in me mouth and light it,” he said; and
smoking it he calmly surveyed the toilers.
“Stiff you didn’t get a Blighty out of it,” a
mate called down to him. “I got all I
want,” the entrapped one grinned. “One of
me legs is bang up against the hot stove
we wuz squattin’ around. She’ll do me.”

“X.S.”: Melbourne magistrates have not
the same prejudice against slang as their
Sydney colleagues; hence their vocabulary
is continually being enlarged. A youth charged
with stealing a baby car was asked where
he had met his accomplice in the crime. “At
college,” he replied. “What college?” asked
the sergeant. “Pentridge,” said the accused.

SHADOW SHOWS.
The
STATE
THEATRES
SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE
“The Exploits of the Emden,” a silent
picture, is a remarkable example of inter-
national co-operation. The Emden sequences
were produced “under the segis of the Ger-
man Admiralty,” the Sydney sequences by
First National, Aust., with the assistance
of the Australian Navy. The two ele-
ments have been dovetailed together with
extraordinary skill to make a connected nar-
rative.
The -picture opens with the map of Europe
bursting into flames. The Emden is at
Tsingtao. She is ordered to sea with her
consort, the Markomannia, under secret in-
structions. En route to the Indian Ocean
she meets and farewells Von Spee’s squad-
ron on its way to extinction at the Falk-
lands. We see the first Australian
convoy moving out, shepherded by the
Melbourne, Sydney and a Japanese warship.
Von Muller makes his ill-fated dash on
Cocos. He passes the Australian convoy on
the night of Nov. 8, 1914. The landing party
at Cocos blows up the wireless mast a few
seconds too late to stop the warning mes-
sage to the Sydney.
The fight is amazingly well recreated. At
first the Emden fires brilliantly, carrying
away the Sydney’s forward fire-control sta-
tion. Then Glossop manoeuvres out of range,
and proceeds methodically to pound the
enemy to pieces. Under a continuous rain
of hammer-blows the Emden crumbles, her
last fighting effort being an attempt to tor-
pedo the Sydney, before grounding, littered
with dead and dying, on North Keeling
Island. The curtain is drawn on Von Mfil-
ler’s Odyssey, with that gallant officer being
told by Glossop to retain his sword, the final
scene being the sea burial of the Australians
killed by the Emden’s first lucky salvo.
Amongst the few important omissions is
the Emden’s most spectacular exploit—her
dash into Penang harbor, where she sank a
Russian destroyer and a French cruiser
while most of the crews were on shore galli-
vanting. This exploit did more damage than
the sinking of merchantmen. It spread a
belief in German might throughout the Brit-
ish 'possessions which caused unrest in
India and led to the Singapore mutiny. More
might have been made of the vital part played
by the cable staff on Cocos, and the sub-
sequent adventures of Von Miicke and his
landing party would provide material for an-
other picture.
On the whole, however, the film is a
notable achievement. Its realism founded
on historical records is a welcome antidote
to the bogus war pictures of Hollywood. It
is typical of Australian entrepreneurs who
are so fond of calling their theatres
“national” that it was not put on at one
of the big houses, but left to the little Strand
in Bourke-street.

George Bancroft, as Joe F'orziati in
“Ladies Love Brutes,” has a part which
was evidently carpentered for him, and him
alone. This Paramount picture is at Syd-
ney Capitol. Joe, millionaire and ex-navvy,
falls in love with fashionable Mimi Howell

the delicately
beautiful Mary
Astor), who
is living apart
from her hus-
b a n d. We
don’t believe a
word of the.
subs e quent
p r o c eedings,
but they are
none the less
exciting for
that. In order
to win Mimi,
he has her
child Jackie
k i d n apped.
The idea is to
stage an im-
pressive . res-
cue. Unfor-
tunately the
chauffeur who
does the job
is in the pay
of Joe’s
enemy, Mike Mendino, gangster. When
Joe strolls along to salvage Jackie he
finds himself in a trap with his own
kid Joey and Mike’s armed hirelings
ready for action. Another lesson is
given in the decline and fall of assassi-
nation amongst those of Latin stock.
(It was chiefly owing to the finished tech-
nique of the assassins of the Roman Empire
that only one son was ever born to a reign-
ing Caesar, and the standard was still higher
in Rome during the Renaissance.) Mendino
and his army not only fail to bump off
Joe, but get knocked unconscious themselves.
Joe doesn’t marry Mimi; the title of the
film is a misnomer. All he gains—assuming
he has the brains to analyse his conduct,
which appears doubtful—is the knowledge
that in attempting to play a shabby trick,
he has made an ass of himself.
Bancroft puts up a couple of furious
scraps, his glorious organ voice is heard to
advantage, and he looks suitably proletarian.
Other commendable features of the show are
the two small boys (the naturalism of these
American kids is delightful) and the Men-
dino of Stanley Fields. Stanley has a face
that would help materially to get him con-
victed before any unsquared jury, and his
acting is as hideously satisfying as his
appearance.

“The Divine Lady” of Corinne Griffith at
Melbourne State is not the robust cook’s
daughter whom English portraitists delighted

waits. Varconi is extraordinarily well cast.

In “Happy Days” (Fox* Movietone), at
Sydney Regent, musical comedy reaches the
goal towards which it has been moving
ever since the talkies arrived. It is without
so much as a vestige of a plot, and the char-
acters are film-favorites who appear as
themselves.
Marjorie White, soubrette, has a row with
Dick Keane, hoofer, flees to N. York, and
gets into the Stage and Screen Club l>y
disguising herself as a page. Her identity
is disclosed when a member kicks her hard
in the expansive seat of her trousers (this
is a matey sort of club where the members
use the servants to play practical jokes on
one another), and her hair comes down.
She persuades Victor McLaglen. W ill
Rogers, El Brendel, Warner Baxter and
about a hundred more to come to Memphis
and help the owner of a financially embar-
rassed show boat.
A vaudeville show follows, with all the per-
formers doing their most popular acts,
Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor sentimen-
talise over love in a cottage; McLaglen and
Bow quarrel about women ; Brandel’s pants
fall down; Whispering Jack Smith croons
the theme song, and so on. A colossal enter-
tainment with plenty of innocuous fun. The
ballets are elaborate but dim, which may
be connected with the fact that “Happy
D ays” is seen elsewhere on Grandeur films.
Love, Live, Laugh, another Fox pro-
auction at the Regent, is a picture of life
New Yorks Italian quarter.. George
Je*sel—small, plain and Semitic, but with
endearing ways and a charming singing and
speaking voice—is the stricken hero He
helps everybody, does his duty in all cir-
cumstances, meets rebuffs with cheerful cour-
age, and then gets blinded at the war and
loses his girl. Which is much more like
life than most talkie plots. The restraint
of Lila Lee as the girl wh i thinks poor
Luigi has been killed, and of Kenneth Mac-
Kenna as the doctor who marries her, adds
to the simple realism of the story. Holly-
wooden pretentiousness intrudes only once,
The young medico’s home would tax the

“Sarah and Son” (Paramount), at Sydney
Prince Edward, is a Mother Love film with
a Lost Ohc-ild motif. But the directress gets
away with it, chiefly owing to the superb
acting of Ruth Chatterton and Phillipe do

boys for whom drama has to thank the

Tears are shed by the pint throughout
the show, and there is hardly a smile in it,
yet it is never tedious, and the closing scenes
are exciting. Would a real-life Bobby turn
with such alacrity to a stranger from those
who have done nothing worse than spoil
him, and who admits are “not bad as
parents go”? Probably not. But such is
Miss Chatterton’s art that she makes us

odd anomalies. Mrs. Ashmore (Doris

Alexander Gordon, who has collected a
K.B. at the advanced age of 72, has spent
his life doing unexpected things. He mar-
ried Margaret Thomas, a J.C.W. musical-
comedy star, just a quarter of a century ago,
when Sydney had decided that he would die
a bachelor. Four years later he went on the
Bench, which involved, amongst other social
sacrifices, saying a long farewell to the card-
rooms of the Union and Australian clubs.
And he became a Divorce Judge, though his
whole professional career had been spent on
the Equity side. He went to England with
his wife and two children, after retiring from
the Bench, and has interested himself in
charitable work since his return.
One of the King’s birthday knighthoods
went to E. H. Macartney, the Queensland
Agent-General. Born in the north of Ireland,
Macartney arrived in Queensland in 1883,
and after a spell at banking served his
articles with the late A. J. Thynne, whom he
was later to partner in one of the State’s
biggest law firms. He sat in the Leg. Assembly
for over 20 years, holding the La*nds port-
folio under Denham ; afterwards, when Labor
came in, he led the Opposition. The keenest
of golfers, he was one of the foundation
members of the Brisbane Club, and until he
left for his London job was its president.

Mrs. Forbes, wife of Maoriland’s new
Priminister, is about the nicest-looking
woman who has ever been chatelaine of the
official residence in Wellington, which is
part of the perks of the head of the Gov-
ernment. She has never played any part
in public affairs, but she can claim to have
indirectly founded her lord’s political for-
tune. When Forbes first decided to stand
for Harunui there were other Liberal aspi-
rants, and Seddon had them all on the carpet,
looked them over and asked them what sup-
port they could command. Said the young
farmer from Cheviot, “I’m only sure of one
vote, Mr. Seddon.” “Your own?” snapped
King Dick. “No, my wife’s,” replied Forbes
softly. Seddon liked that. '“God bless her!
God bless her!” he roared fervently. Forbes

It was curious that when J. E. Davidson
felt in a position to buy a newspaper and
say some of the things he had long wanted
to say, he should return to within a fevfr
miles of his birthplace. His father was a

and it was on this holding that teamsters
broke the first load of ore ever sent from the

J. E. DAVIDSON.
Davidson bought the “Barrier Miner,” which
has always been the Radical paper at Broken
Hill; and he had great joy in running it for
three or four years. Then he widened his
field. “Davey” was one of the founders of
the Australian Journalists’ Association, and
even when he became a newspaper proprietor
his colleagues at some conferences with news-
paper workers thought he ought to have
been sitting on the other side of the ffiible.
The affable individual whom Westralia
knew for 20 years as Judge Rooth is dead
in England. He was brought out from that
country after his fellow-Englishman McMil-
lan, now C.J., had made good, but he fell
so far short of the McMillan standard that
a joker found wide acceptance for the story
that the letter inviting him to become a
Judge had been intended for another Rooth
altogether. Perth accepted him good-
humoredly, as it did his Asiatic valet, his
patronage of racing (he was a shrewd tote
punter) and amateur theatricals, and his
refusal to be inveigled into the married
state.
The tallest man in uniform to shake
Vic. Governor Somers’s hand on King’s
Birthday was Colonel Carroll, of Heidel-
berg, whose breast bore Boer War and Great
War medals. Carroll was one of the oldest
members of the A.I.F. to see service in
France. He got himself transferred from
second in command of a transport to a>
battalion and stuck it until he was invalided.
He was not far off 70 then.
W. J. Gall, who has stopped a C.M.G.,
was born in Ipswich, “the Queensland
Athens,” and went early into the Home
Department, of which he is now the execu-
tive head. Among the many tough jobs he
has tackled was the settlement of the tangled
accounts of the Queensland regiments that
served in the Boer War. They took a long
time to unravel, for army pay methods were
gloriously confused in those days, but Gall
ended up by satisfying everybody.
William McPherson is returning from
Europe by way of North America; ho is
due back in Melbourne shortly after Par-
liament reassembles on July 23. The Oppo-
sition leader is being kept well informed of
the progress of events, and, incidentally, of
how shabbily his constituency, Hawthorn, is
being treated by the Government, although
its member made the State a present of its
Domestic Economy College and has been a
public benefactor in other directions. While
Prendergast was Opposition leader for 20
years no non-Labor Government dreamt of
giving his constituency the cold shoulder.
The Order of Merit has been bestowed on
Dr. Samuel Alexander, and he is the first
Australian to get it. Born in Sydney 61
years ago, Alexander was at Wesley College
and Melbourne University before going to
Balliol College, Oxford. He has long been
recognised as the foremost professor of
philosophy in the Empire; his association
with the Victoria Uni. of Manchester has
elevated its repute amongst the scholastic
institutions of the world, and his “Moral
Order and Progress” and works on Locke and
Spinoza have established his fame as a
writer. Maoriland already boasts an O.M. —
Rutherford, the great chemist, who also won
a Nobel prize.
Toranoski Kitamura, who has died at
Kobe while on a visit to Japan, was a
pioneer of Sydney’s little Japanese colony
of woolbuyers. He was head of Kanematsu,
Ltd., which, founded in a small way in 1889
as a branch of the original firm in Kobe,
grcw r to be one of the biggest concerns of
its sort in Australia, exporting an annual
average of 36,000 bales, besides tallow and
other by-products. A man of sterling char-
acter, he. did not forget the country in which
ho made his money; his princely gift of
£25,000 to Sydney Hospital will preserve
his name.
Frank Williamson, having passed the re-
tiring age, is leaving the State teaching
service (Vic.). For nearly half a century
the poet-dominie has labored to implant a
love of literature in the mind of the young-
sters he has taught from the Murray to
the sea. Adamson, of Wesley College, was
his master for a time, and he had Adam-
son’s active encouragement in this especially
valuable part of his good work for Australia.
Charlie Bernays, Queensland’s Clerk of
Parliament, can now append the 1.5.0. to his
name. He may be said to have been cradled
in the precincts; his dad, the late Lewis
Bernays, was Clerk of Parliament before
him. Long as the father’s record was, the
son has exceeded it, for it is 53 years since
he took up his first job in the Parliamentary
offices.
David Ross, who has died at Yarra Glen
(Vic.), at the age of 80, c iscovered two
comets. One of them is still sailing through
spa<ce unaware of the fact that since 1884
its name has been “Ross’s comet.” Ross was
one of the world’s leading amateur astro-
nomers, and his observatory on top of the
beautiful Christmas Hills was invariably the
rendezvous for visiting stargazers. Up to
1915 he was a National Bank manager.
The Rev. Sam Forsyth is recalling
memories to old South Australians. In the
early ’nineties, when times were bad, too,
there was a great shout of “Back to the
Land!” and Hugh Gilmore, a Methodist
pai*son from the
English North
Country, was
one who greatly
helped the move-
ment. Now the
new head of the
Adelaide Cen-
tral Methodist
Mission, Sam
Forsyth, an-
other North
Count ryman,
but from Ire-
land, has begun
a crusade and
wants to put the
best of the city’s
unemployed
young men on
land which the
Government has
made available
at Kuitpo
F'orest. It is
handy to the
city—within 25
miles —and the

idea is to con-

dairying, pigs
and poultry,
which are quick

Clarke, managing editor of the “News.” It

assistant-editor of Melbourne “Herald,” but
was lured away from Australia by a visit-

controls the cocoa press. Clarke is a small,
black-haired, dynamic Englishman with a
passionate and oft-expressed love of Aus-
tralia. Since his return to London the
“Daily News” has had more items about
the Commonwealth than any three other
British papers. Clarke also gives Australia

inexplicable thing about our accent is its
fortuitousness. Scullin, heard on the movie-
tone, talks like Boyce; Theodore, like a
London actor or barrister. Personally, I
prefer the Boyce-Scullin method, which is
resonantly audible, to Theodore's, which,
though unaffected, is on the muffled and
throaty side. Both varieties are of course
preferable to the muted Australian accents
of Bruce and Bavin. Speakers of this type
sound every now and again like Old
Etonians gone wrong.
CASUALTIES.
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
“Deceased was a returned soldier and was suffer-
ing from war disabilities. An inquest will be held.”
The peace is thinning out the ranks
That war had shaken witli its strain.
Too hard the struggle, small the thanks,
For those who had to fight again
To win the place their service cost,
Which men by war unweakened fill;
Into a shameful discard tossed,
Our comrades they are falling still!
They staggered back from Bullecourt
The remnants of a gallant band;
At Passchendaele they bled and fought;
At Villers-Bret. they made their stand.
Thinned, .sadly thinned, they homeward came,
The men that harsh war did not kill,
To die in misery and shame—
Our comrades who are falling still!
War had some pity in its heart.
Had honor for the men who fell;
For him who falters in the Mart,
Who shall the beads of pity tell?
Wounded and worn, they struggle on
Till dark defeats their brave hearts chill;
Then sudden from our ranks are gone
Our comrades who are falling still.

ESTIMATED PROFITS AND RETURNS TO INVESTORS.
The sale of better-class Records, i.e., 10-inch and 12-inch Records, retailed at from 3/- to 6/6, amounts to approximately
10,000,000 annually in Australia and New Zealand. Popular Dance and Vocal Records, with the demand continually
increasing, are usually retailed at 4/- each. It is the intention of the Company to sell to the public a product
equal in every respect to these Records, embracing an extensive range of the very latest theme songs from talkie
films, and the latest hits from musical shows, in both vocal and dance form, at the popular price of 2/6 each,
and a range of 12-inch Records, comprising world-famous and ever-popular light classical, operatic and standard
numbers by many famous artists, orchestras and military bands (usually retailed at 6/6) for 4/-. It also intends
to support the sale of these Records by an extensive advertising campaign. On this basis the following estimated
profits for the first year are considered conservative. It is anticipated that during the first two years £30,000 will
have been spent in advertising and developing the sale of the Company’s Records, which, with the normal expansion
of business to be reasonably expected under these circumstances during the second year’s trading, fully justifies the
Directors in estimating a considerable increase in profits for that year, and they, therefore, consider it not unreason-
able to anticipate that the following Dividends will be paid:—
10 PER CENT. DIVIDEND—First Year. 20 PER CENT. DIVIDEND—Second Year.

Anyone who believes that vaudeville is
one of the dead languages should go down
and see the show they put on at Sydney
Stadium on a Monday night. Going, you
may pass near two of its old stamping-
grounds—the Tiv., a shuttered, decrepit pile
with the paint peeling off it; and Fullers’, loud
with talkies. Thereabout the ancient art is
At the wrestling—where one touch of ill-nature makes the whole world kin.
alleged to have died a year or so ago—
senile decay, some said ; others, suicide. It
did not die at all; it simply lapsed for want
of a quorum. This having been found, in
the form of entertainers called wrestlers —
great players to the gallery; prime fallabout
merchants; choice givers of the open-handed
left smack to the car and the deft right bite
to the nose—the art boometh again at the
new address.
A difference between this vaudeville and the
old is that it can get right over to the audi-
ence. For instance, though last week in the
ring a broth of a bhoy named Pat McGill
(15st. 81b.) partnered a wee bit laddie named
George McLeod (lost.), theirs was not the
best turn. The best was done by a small
member of the audience named Frith. When
George hurled Pat out through the ropes in
round three, Frith’s dive over four rows
of seats and under the fifth was acrobatics
of a very high order. Then when Pat threw
George out, Frith proved his vaudeville versa-
tility by staging a really good vanishing act.
He simply disappeared. George looked sur-
prised, disappointed, even discouraged. His
expression, as he climbed back into the ring,
seemed to suggest that that sort of thing
wasn’t done. What else was Frith and the
rest of the press put round the ring for,
except to act as cushions? Still, Frith was
not inexcusable. Even an artist, accustomed
as the breed is to nudes, is likely to over-
look ethics when 15st of flesh, however de-
lectable, is thrown at his head. Besides,
wrestlers have been known to lapse from
ethical grace themselves. It is on record
that one night at this same Stadium one of
them picked up his comrade and hit a poli-
tician with him. That, of course, was quite
legitimate, even commendable, but when the
other fellow retorted by hitting his comrade
T HE CHAP ON THE MAT ( bitterly ): “Hoots,
mon, ye’re no woman!”
with the politician that was unanimously
regarded in all the best wrestling circles as
getting a bit low. _
However, overlooking Frith’s occasional,
and perhaps sudden, lapses, there was no-
thing that could be construed as bad form
about last week’s engagement. Unless,
maybe, it was George. Billed as the Ter-
rible Scot, he entered the ring dressed in a
dowdy old-gold sateen gown and maroon
trunks. Some thought that the bagpipes were
played as he emerged from his dressing-
room, an understandable mistake, consider-
ing the noise the trams were making outside,
But George didn’t even wear a twig of
tartan, and he finally refuted all claim to
recognition as a Scotchman by going through
to the seventh round without having a drink.
Even then the stuff he took looked crimin-
ally like water, and, though the broadcaster
up aloft shouted into his microphone two
or three times that George looked groggy, the
“Sydney Morning Herald” was probably
right in calling the fellow an American.
On the other hand, Pat, billed as the Irish
Terror, wore a green dressing-gown, with a
gold harp on the back of it and gold sham-
rocks inside, and when he stripped this lot
off he was modestly clad in green trunks.
These last proved a happy omen for at least
one young lady, who backed Pat because of
what she called “a happy coincidence.”
Pat won, with what a bull-voiced chap stood
up in the ring and called a “crotch back
slam.” It might have been called a no-
trumps grand slam if it hadn’t come so
soon after Pat had raced four times round
the ring with George after him, industriously
kicking the fleeting green trunks south of the
line. That might have been good wrestling,
but you’d hardly call whatever retort Pat
made “grand,” even if it was a slam.
Still, that is one good point about wrest-
ling—there appear to be no rules. When
the competitors step into the ring the referee
runs his fingers through their hair and feels
their trunks for horseshoes, but after that
he doesn't seem to bother about them any
more. Someone dongs a gong, and the two
slightly disguised nudes (or it may be prima
donnas incog.) rush over to the middle of
the ring and grab each other’s head. Then
they sit on each other and grunt. Then
they get hold of each other’s feet and twist
them to see if they’ll come off, after which
they seem to get tired of wrestling and try
boxing for a while. A few examples by
George of tossing the caber; Pat in the Old-
Man-of-tlie-Sea act from “The Arabian
Nights,” a polite interlude in which each in
turn puts his knee in the other’s stomach
and tries to push it through; George as
Mark Antony in the lend-me-your-ear scene;
Pat in a clever imitation of Pavlova’s Dying
Swan; then back to their cornel’s, where
they sit and brood. They seem to have done
everything to each other short of man-
slaughter : the crowd shows its appreciation
by counting them out —for not trying!
W’hile the chief actors sit and think about
their art, you may look round the audience.
Near at hand it is composed mostly of poli-
ticians, pressmen, a sprinkling of women and
a fair array of collars worn back to front.
Back in the gods a gentleman is obligingly
lifting the metal tops off beer bottles for his
friends with his teeth. Boys are w’alking
around talking to themselves about peanuts.
You sight a face through the thick smoke
that is somehow familiar. Also, it is tragic.
An old boxer out of a job. An ex-A.I.F.
man who turned prize-fighter, and of whom
The Bulletin once said that he had
“solved the problem of repatriation with a
punch.” And look at him now! It calls
for genius to do him justice, and you might
as well call in genius to do it —that sterling
poet “Bellerive,” in a stirring, hitherto un-
published masterpiece, “Past Celebrates of
the Ring”:—
Grifo and Tim Heggarity,
And Hock Keys in their time
Shone among the lightweights
Of our Australian clime.
Willing Jack McGowan ;
In a long agressive bout,
Could give and take a slogging
And wear a rival out.
A wizard was Tim Heggarity,
Who early passed away,
And fearless Jack McGowan
Lies mingled in the clay.
Meeghan, Walsh and Whiting
Were effective, fast and clever;
Downey was a stayer as
Tough as solid leather.
Recalled by old ringsiders,
Grey haired and o’ercast,
Are scientific boxers
Whom battled in the past.
But now the chaps who have usurped
their ring are at it again. One leads with a
fine right tickle to the ribs; the other
counters with a clever left spit to the eye.
The referee forgets himself and attempts
to interfere, and is rightly brushed aside.
They lock their hands together and hit each
other that way. They roll on each other
and groan. They jump on each other and
grin. They kneel on each other and gloat.
After about an hour and a half of this they
get out of the ring as they got into it,
perfectly fresh, leaving the audience to find
its way out, perfectly exhausted.
You go home and have a game of bridge
to recover your ego. Even you might get
a slam at bridge.

“Man and Superman,” Pshaw’s 100 p.c.
talkie, was produced by the Beresford
Fowlers at the Queen’s Hall, Melbourne,
last week to a crowded house. Despite the
amateur acting of a number of very raw
recruits, the piece was reasonably well inter-
preted, and helped to confirm this critic’s
suspicion that there never was a writer so
consistently wrongheaded in his judgments
than the prescient G.B.S. “Man and Super-
man” is less direct observation of life than
second-hand Nietscheanism worked out in
terms of a set of thoroughly inhuman beings.
One of Shaw’s theses is that the motor-car
and a State-school education will turn an
average Cockney into a philosophic cynic
who prattles of Voltaire and Beaumarchais.
Five minutes’ conversation with any of the
taxi-drivers waiting outside the Queen’s
Hall would have given the audience a
sounder idea about the matter. It is an
even bet that they were discussing Amy
Johnson and the Grand National chances
of Seegur Ghat.

The Backhaus season at Melbourne Town
Hall was being indefinitely extended when
this paper went to press. The grave little
man’s most entrancing concert of last week
was the one in which Schuinann’s symphonic
studies had place. The perfection of his
touch was shown by his ability to say one
of these variations with a blast and then
whisper the next, while miraculously pre-
serving the balance of the whole.
The Melbourne Showman owes an apology
to Backhaus for his recent remarks con-
cerning that virtuoso’s programmes. Like
a good strategist, it seems, Backhaus is
bringing up his heaviest artillery at the end
of his musical offensive. Beethoven’s Op. 106
Study in still-life, Wrestlers resting.
and 111 were to be played last night (Tues-
day), and if they were executed as magni-
ficently as the Sonata Quasi und fantasia,
Op. 27, was at the matinee on Thursday,
the writer is prepared to make any amends
short of eating his hat.
* * *
Hugh McCrae’s lecture, “My Father and
His Friends,” delivered at Scots’ Church
Hall in Melbourne, was continuously inter-
rupted for the first 20 minutes by late
arrivals (the comp, can make it “late
elephants” if he likes) and a committee
anxious to accomodate them with chairs. Poet
Hugh has obviously made himself a public
speaker by brute force. In his discourse there
were some gems of literary ray supreme, and
the re-reading of them so entranced their
author that his emotions mounted to his throat
and choked their utterance. Nevertheless,
lie painted a picture of Melbourne’s Golden
Age which also entranced his hearers. His
description of an early omnibus trip was
an excellent piece of childish reminiscence.
The lecturer’s Golden Age is, of course,
a myth. Any age becomes Golden after
a sufficient lapse of time, just as does
any wedding, provided the Divorce Court
doesn’t intervene. Anybody who cares to
keep a diary or is blessed with the Proust-
like memory of McCrae will find the present
Tin Age has become miraculously aurifer-
ous and many of its midgets giants in
another 40 years.
If hard work returns theatrical dividends,
Nellie Bramley should collect at Sydney Opera
House. She is putting on a new show weekly,
and doing it well. No suggestion- ot the
rush gets over the footlights; the solid
bunch of players know their jobs better than
most do in longer rehearsed offerings. Sound
acting is helped in the current piece, “Anne
100 Per Cent.,” by very good effects, and the
show altogether is a good entertainer in the
light comedy line.
FRITH (benor) : “ Shure, a little bit of
Heaven fell from out the sky one day!”
An enthusiastic crowd turned up to the
matinee given by the Firm in aid of Muriel
Starr at Sydney Majesty’s last week. Edith
Taliaferro, Clem Dawe, Gus Bluett, Nellie
Bramley, the Westminster Glee Singers and
the pick of the legit, generally helped the
show along with joyous brevities, and Muriel
herself appeared in the first act of “Within
the Law.” Among them they provided a
first-class afternoon’s entertainment.

A very promising youngster, Hugh
McClean, fiddled before a big audience at
Sydney Uni. Con. one night last week. The
lad plays the Kreisler arrangements of
Paganini and Tartini with assurance and
finish ; his style is good, and his tone clear
and sonorous. His playing has aroused the.
enthusiasm of Associated Board examiners,
and they are not easily impressed. McClean
is to be sent abroad to finish his musical
education.
The Palette~
The show by Minnie Baynes at the
Society of Arts gallery in Adelaide adds one
more to the pleasant but uninspired exhibi-
tions. The lady is an Australian with long
English experience, and the programme roves
from Mount Gambier to St. Ives. Sometimes
in the -lower tones, and particularly when
dealing with old buildings, the result is
admirable, but this occurs too seldom.
The travel sketches by Charles Wheeler
a*t the Sedon Galleries, Melbourne, are 16
years old, and, as often happens, are very
much more vital than the pallid nudes
self-consciously posing in an atmosphere of
unreality of the later Wheeler. The pencil
drawings in particular are delightful. When
the artist did these he was an ardent explorer,
full of hope that the Promised Land lay
round the next corner. Nowadays he is only
a picture maker.
The Society of Artists got together a
varied and on the whole interesting collec-
tion for its special exhibition at the Blaxland
Galleries, Sydney. The “special” aspect of
the show is a maximum price of 25 guineas,
an arrangement that would help to make
many other art exhibitions less ridiculous
INDIGNANT BROGUE PROM THE GODS : “Hit
him a kick yerself, Pat!”
than they usually are. Daryl Lindsay’s
lot includes a fine “Landscape to Tooradin,”
and there is faithful painting in land-
scapes by Robert Johnson, S. Woodward
Smith and John Rowell. Sydney Gallery
bought some tree trunks by John D. Moore.
Alfred Enes might change his name to
Greens, if only as a safeguard against using
such color irrespective of its honesty.

This Week’s Investment Tip.
Five out of six of those who write to this
paper’s busy Service Department for advice
about putting money into new ventures are
people of small means who cannot at all well
afford losses. And three times out of four
or thereabouts they ask whether The Bulle-
tin ‘‘thinks this would be a safe investment.”
Every class of investment suits somebody.
The “Wild Cat” some time ago classified 50
well-known Australian , stocks, arranging
them into 10 divisions according to its
opinion of the risks they carried. Class 1,
the very safest, were yielding 5 p.c. or less;
and in the other classes the return rose
generally with the risk. Moreover, there are
shares, debentures, etc., not quoted and not
classified, attractive only to the pure
gambler. The first thing the investor, great
or small, needs to do is to classify him-
self. Does he want the most safety it is
possible to get? Or how much risk is he
prepared to take in return for the possibility
of getting a higher interest rate?
In most cases, if he hasn’t much money
and pounds are very precious, he will go
not only for safety but for something with-
out any further liability and readily sale-
able. And he can be assured that nothing
is readily saleable unless it is listed on a
Stock Exchange. The exceptions to that
rule are negligible so far as the general
body of small investors are concerned.
The person who is trying to sell you £1
shares, and wants only ss. down, will tell
you that the other 15s is put in so that it
may be paid out of profits and you can then
get dividends on it. In 999 cases out of 1000
he is a poor devil who is lying hard to
make a crust. Once you put your name on
the dotted line you are liable for that 155.;
? IK I . you can ’t get out of the liability by
forfeiting the shares. Nothing that the poor
devil aforesaid has told you or promised you
matters.
If you can afford to lose your money
you can afford to apply for shares in a new
venture. But rarely otherwise. Of course
there are new cos. that succeed and go on
succeeding. For every success, however,
there are countless failures. And quite
naturally. _ Success in business depends on
a dozen things; and all of them are rarely
possessed by a new co.
Even when an old business is taken over
by a new co. there is risk in it. Very
often the old proprietors go out because
they feel themselves slipping; and in many
cases they form a new co. because that is
the only way in which they can turn obso-
lete plant and stock into money.
Shares in new cos. occasionally turn up
trumps. But these are the prizes: these are
the things that compensate (more or less)
for the countless failures. With rare excep-
tions, then, shares in new cos. are a gamble.
If you are looking for a gamble rather than
an investment, they may be worth buying.
But if you are looking for a safe invest-
ment, involving no risks or the minimum of
risks, you will go rather to the old-estab-
lished concern for which there is a proved
need, whose management has been tested,
and whicji is past the often long and tedi-
ous business of establishing a goodwill.

£3592, £3124 and £975 back to the be-
ginning; total £28,434. The figures through-
out are very largely guesswork. They leave
out of the reckoning substantial sums spent
on establishment, etc., and charged up to
share premium account; if the sums so
charged were not enough, then ordinary
banking profits were better than claimed,
and, of course, not so good if things were
the other way around.
At February 28 the co. had put out 492,612
£5 7 p.c. cum. prefs. and 22 ords. of £1 each
—only 10 new shares were issued during the
year. The lot are called to £1 eacn, and
paid capital is £438,803 (up £4368 during
the year), so there was still another £52,531
to come in. The prefs. were issued at a pre-
mium of a pound each, and the premium
reserve, which was apparently drawn upon
for £3308 last year, stood at £61,706 when
the books closed. Assuming that the full
amount of premium has been received on all
shares issued, establishment, including the
heavy cost of wide and vigorous share-selling
which forced the opening of many doubtful
outposts, has run off with £430,906. To
represent that and the paid capital, share-
holders can see £528,943 belonging to them
in a business scattered over all the Aus
tralian States.
Banking is not the profitable business
many people think it is, nor are the profits
therefrom so good as they used to be either.
Few of the old-established Australasian
banks show better than 8 p.c. on share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves com-
bined), notwithstanding that they have
accumulated large inner reserves, which
assist the earnings. So until substantial
reserves have been accumulated, only very
moderate returns need be looked for from
this institution, and regular divs. are not
yet in sight. Meanwhile shareholders who
are depositors will have to content them-
selves with interest on their quarterly
balances—the co. pays 2 p.c. on current
accounts. Of course the pref. div. is accumu-
lating, but that does not mean anything one
way or another, because all but a handful
of the capital is pref. money; in other words,
these shareholders merely owe the unpaid
divs. to themselves.
In its service to the community as a
lender the bank has made steady progress
and done good work:—

The co. did very well indeed last year to
retain all but £8169 of the pile of deposits
it had built up during a run of favorable
years. To meet this small shrinkage, and a
reduction of £23,347 in other liabilities, and
to add £34,909 to the advances and £12,427
to the premises items, the board drew upon
liquids for £75,020. Liquids thus dropped
back to 30.5 p.c. of the liabilities to the
public as against 33.9 p.c. and 42.8 p.c. at
the two preceding balances. The £1,391,720
of deposits, etc., not covered by liquids,
were secured by advances, premises, etc.,
with a book value of £1,920,663 at Feb.
28, and depositors w r ho were not shareholders
could see £2,024,279 of uncalled capital
besides. It is a satisfactory position, but it
means low earning power.
One of the co.’s difficulties is to get
branches on a payable basis.

During the last half, which includes the
Christmas trade, gross profits (£70,553)
slipped £10,517, while exes. (£28,874)
were*' got back £6241; thus, after allowing
for a small unexplained addition to reserves,
the final figure was £9376 poorer than that
of the preceding term. Still, after handing
the profs, their £4OOO, what was left was
at the rate of 16.3 p.c. p.a. on the half-
million of ord. capital, compared with 17.9
p.c. for the 12 months to March 31, 1929,
and 16.5 p.c. and 14 p.c. for the two years
before that.
Nevertheless, the 2 p.c. bonus with which
the board surprised the market 18 months
ago was dropped, leaving the div. at 10 p.c.
It was lifted a couple of points to that rate
three years ago, and although earnings may
ease further yet, they are very comfortably
in excess of 10 p.c. Also the buttress for
capital is becoming more substantial, though
it is not so stout as the bare figures in the
table suggest; they are there labelled nomi-
nal because they are subject to £118,074 of
goodwill. The management has lately de-
voted a lot of attention to weeding out dead
lines and livening the turnover in others.
Additions, etc., to premises have provided
improved facilities, and the Maoriland busi-
ness is on a better footing than it used to be.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures disclose it, with comparisons showing
the improvement over the last five years:—

Last year £30,143 was lopped off the mort-
gage and £21,259 off the amount coming to
sundry creditors, but overdraft is £101,293
greater. Stocks, which are claimed to be
valued on a conservative basis, were £BlBO
lighter, and book debts were reduced £24,072.
The sudden growth in other assets is mainly
on account of payments in advance
(£113,006, up £102,507). Altogether the
more or less liquid surplus (£405,519 includ-
ing stocks) was £71,854 lighter than at
March 31, 1929.
All shares rank equally in respect of capi-
tal, and at the close of last accounts the
backing was 245. 4d. in net tangibles. The
ords., which were at 335. 6d. six months ago,
recently sold for 275. Allowing for the
div., the return at the latter price is
7.7 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The prefs.,
which carry a fixed cumulative 8 p.c., are
tightly held.

This Melbourne hosiery co. was launched on
the flood-waters of the post-war boom. Soon
half its capital _ had to be jettisoned; but
that got the business on an even keel. Then
executives were sent abroad to investigate
production methods and costs, and the in-
stallation of full-fashioned machines followed
lmrnediately. Technical difficulties were
quickly overcome, and the management gave
attention to marketing, the policy being to
improve quality rather than cut prices, and
to push sales by vigorous advertising. Splen-
did results have been achieved, and the
business continues to step along briskly,
despite depressing conditions.
Gross profits, which were only £37,679 in
1925, mounted to £317,898 last year, when
the spring was £14,103. Exes. (£87,298)
made off with all but £676 of the increase,
and there was more capital to feed; still,
after handing the prefs. their £4580, the
balance of the year’s net earnings was an
attractive 37.7 p.c. on average ord. capital
compared with 44.1, 30.3 and 34.7 p.c. for
each of the three preceding years. The
special 5 p.c. bonus sent out with the final
div. in 1929 was not repeated, and share
premiums make the 15 p.c. (5 p.c. of it
carries the usual bonus tag) worth only 10
p.c. on all capital gathered since 1925, while
the writing down, already referred to, re-
duces the return to half the declared rate
on old holdings. However, margins are
wide; over the last five years approximately
49 p.c. of. the aggregate net profits have re-
mained in the business to fertilise earnings.
And more machines are on order, as the
present plant is being driven to its full com-
fortable capacity.
Last year £35,459, including £14,033 of
share premiums, was gathered on scrip
issued shortly before the close of accounts in
1929, and at March 31 there was a further
£14,967 of capital and £7483 of premium
moneys still to come:—
1925. 1928. 1929. 1930.
Paid capital.. £33,1.81 £111,710 £130,786 £155,242
Debentures .. 9,563
Overdraft .. 7,460 9,864 84 9,906

Cash.. .. 6,679 25 24 10
Thus, with the year’s surplus earnings and
£20,675 added to the debt, the board was
able to spend on fixed assets £52,926 more
than was written off and carry an extra
£35,980 of stocks. Book debts were £16,204
lighter, but there was little change in the
more or less liquid surplus—£lo3,367, in-
cluding stocks.
The market expresses its confidence in the
future and the management by paying 17s.
6d. for the ords. (fully paid to 10s.) as
against 21s. a year ago. At the current
figure the return is 8.5 p.c. on a 15 p.c. div.
basis: the backing amounts to 12s. 6d. in
net tangibles. The £1 8 p.c. cum. prefs.,
which have priority as to capital, can be
had around par. Last year’s net profit was
more than 6J times their annual require-
ments, and the cover is £4 2s. 3d. in net
tangibles.

Profit margins are so narrow in the Maori-
land freezing business that even a small
drop in Smitlifield (Eng.) mutton prices is
liable to play havoc with the freezing cos.’
figures; and last year’s markets for mutton,
wool, hides and tallow all weakened. Never-
theless Southland was able to pull through
with scarcely a quiver. The verra consairr-
vative board, which had given shareholders
an extra taste in each of the two preceding
years, exhibited a few pounds more profit
than was necessary to repeat the < 12 p.c.
div.
That the co. was abl*fc to make such a>
good showing is due largely to the fact that
the works are at Invercargill, Mataura and
Makarewa. When supplies are plentiful, as
they were last year, the co. does not have
to compete for stock in the crowded Can-
terbury markets, nor do buyers for the
works further north reckon it worth while
coming to the extreme southern end of the
island. Also, during the fat years of the
British meat-purchase scheme and other
war contracts, the board put by very much
more than it distributed, notwithstanding a
cash bonus of £22.761, which was sent out
together with £45,522 of gift-scrip 10 years
ago. Thus reserves £16,577 in excess of
the £113,547 of paid capital had accumu-
lated at the close of last accounts, and no
less than £101,165 was invested outside the
business. No hint is given as to what these
investments turn in. but in the circumstances
it is reasonable to assume that they are sub-
stantial contributors to the pool.
Further, there are good grounds for sus-
pecting that as opportunity offered addi-
tions were made to fixed assets and charged
up against earnings. In 1913 plant stood
in the books at £129,711; the figure grew to
£153.915 in 1920, but was back to £116,082
at Dec. 31, 1927. Meanwhile the capacity
of the works had been greatly increased, and
the outlay must have been considerable.
Last year £5339 more was spent on fixed
assets than was written off, thus advancing
their book value to £126,266.
Here is the skeleton of the business as
balance-sheet figures present it:—
1924. 1927. 1928. 1929.
Paid capital.. £113,539 £113,547 £113,547 £113,547
Liabilities .. 40,587 48,453 50,049 41,699

Book debts,
cash, invest-
ments eta 139,037 157,980 157,508 143,340
The position is very solid. At the close
of last accounts the more or less liquid
surplus (£124,218 including stocks) covered
the £26,160 of pref. capital over four and a
half times. After allowing bare cover for
the prefs., the balance was equal to 245.
9d. per pound of ord. capital, and there
was a further 28s. lid. in the written-down
book value of the fixed assets.
The prefs. advance with the ords. in any
distribution beyond 5 p.c., and enjoy priority
as to capital. Both classes of scrip are at
80s. Sd. on the market, the return at that
price being 6.8 p.c. on a 12 p.c. div. ba«sis.

But the collapse of wool values and the low T
prices ruling in the sheep and produce mar-
kets bit deeply into earnings. For the nine
months to March 31 the Australian average
per bale was £l3 9s. lid., the lowest figure
since pre-war days, and no less than £8 2s.
below the average for the 1928-29 season.
Also, mainly owing to the extension of the
auctions, there were 20,071 bales in the co.’s
store when the books last closed.
Because of all this, and possibly a larger
provision for contingencies, there was a
sharp drop of £17,811 in the year’s gross
profit. Exes. (£66,092) were got back
£1154; thus the final figure eased to 7.4 p.c.
on average capital. So no bonus was paid
to clients, who are mostly shareholders, and
three points were knocked off the div., reduc-
ing it to 7 p.c.
For the preceding eight years regular 10
p.c. divs., aggregating £44,304, were paid,
£65,834 was handed out in rebates —30 p.c.
on wool and 15 p.c. on livestock and pro-
duce charges—and £27,042, or approximately
22 p.c. of the total net earnings, remained
in the business. Deducting bonuses to con-
signors the balance of the net earnings was
13.6 p.c. on average capital in 1929 com-
pared with 14.8, 14.8, 12.5, 10.7 and 12.6
p.c. back to 1924.
Since then the business has stepped along
briskly; £62,707 of fresh capital has
been gathered and £110,791 added to the
debt in order to finance the brisker trading.
The new money enabled the board to make
additions to the co.’s wool store, thereby
eliminating double handling and storage
charges, but most of it was put out on
advance to clients:—

Last year’s difficult conditions show up
in a reduction of £82,021 in the amount
coming to sundry creditors (now £75,906).
This was due largely to the with-
drawal of deposits, to meet which the
board w’ent to its bankers for an extra
£84,330, raising the overdraft to £121,327.
There was thus 275. Id. of outside money
at risk in the business for every pound
belonging to shareholders at March 31.
The debt, which was then £10,779 in
excess of the more or less liquids, may stand
in the way of an increase in the div. rate
for a while, especially if bonuses to clients
are to be restored. Much will depend upon
the course of wool prices; these have recently
strengthened, but a return to former levels
need not be looked for.
The backing for each pound of paid capi-
tal is 295. in net tangibles ; all of it repre-
sented by freeholds, etc. The scrip is not

Vocalion (Australasia), Ltd.
This is the co. which is being promoted
by Radio and Record Pty., Ltd., to take over
its gramophone record manufacturing, etc.,
business at Richmond (Vic.), and to buy the
distributing business of Picot, Rosenthal
Pty., Ltd. Nominal capital is £300,000 in
£50,000 £1 8 p.c. cum. par. prefs. and a
million ords. of ss. each. All the prefs. and
400,000 ords. are offered.
The price for the manufacturing business,
which was previously carried on by Vocalion
(Foreign), Ltd., a pup of the Vocalion
Gramophone Co., London, is £125,000 —
£40,000 6i p.c. 10-year debentures, £45,000
in fully-paid ords. and £40,000 cash or
scrip at vendors’ option. The assets, inde-
pendently valued, comprise plant, £56,250;
recording studio, £6500; fittings, etc.,
£1425; stocks, £42,867; goodwill, rights,
etc., £23,177. Also £9500 of trade debts
are to be taken over. The rights, which
cover Australia and Maoriland, include the
matrix services of the Vocalion Co., London,
and the American Record Corporation, and
the use of “brownlac,” a new material for
making records; the lot valued at £14,500.
The Vocalion goodwill and trade-marks, and
the agency for Cowey Gramophone motors
and a 10-years’ lease of the factory premises,
with an option to buy the freehold for
£14,500, are priced at £8677. The Picot,
Rosenthal business is to be bought outright
for £22,000 by an exchange of ord. scrip
at par,, and the services of the two principals
are to be retained. Precisely what assets
the co. get* in connection with this deal
is not disclosed in the prospectus.
In addition to the manufacture of records
from matrices obtained overseas, the co.
will conduct a local recording studio and
make portable gramophones, needles and
radio combinations a-s well. The intention
is to make a cut of about 38 p.c. in the
selling price of records, launch a vigorous
advertising campaign, and with the assist-
ance of the tariff against foreign competition,
thus make a bold bid for local trade. But
turnover in this class of business threatens
to be restricted until conditions become more
settled.
No hint is given as to what the earnings
of either of the two old businesses amounted
to in the past. In the new co. divs. of 10
p.c. for the first and 20 p.c. for the second
year are spoken of on a paid capital of
£l72,ooo—that assumes, on a full sub-
scription of the present issue, that the prefs.
will be called to 10s. and the contributing
ords. to 4s. each. Gross profits for the first
12 months are put at £65,000, and exes.,
including taxation and debenture interest,
at £41,100, leaving £23,900 net.
The prefs. have priority as to capital and
the right to advance with the ords. to 10
p.c. Excluding the distributing business, and
subject to preliminary exes., full subscrip-
tion of the present issue w r ould provide net
tangible cover of £3 Bs. 4d. for the prefs.,
mostly in plant, worth what it can be
made to earn. Estimated net profits are
over times their minimum annual require-
ments.
The co. has gone to allotment on the
firm underwriting of only £20,000 of capi-
tal, which, however, is not to form part of
the vendors’ consideration. Brokerage is
fixed at p.c.
On the board are R. Rich, John But-
ters and A. G. Arnold, all of Sydney; J. S.
Emanuel and W. V. Worth, both of Auck-
land ; and C. L. Ivempton, London.
Another old Queensland field is to be raked
over. This is the Hodgkinson, a near neigh-
bor of the Etheridge, and, like it, a first-
class producer in its time, though mostly from
small shows. In its heyday, some 50 years
ago, the Hodgkinson boasted over a dozen
batteries stamping good stone, and is credited
with a production of over a million pounds’
worth of the metal. The ores, like most of
those in the far nor’-west of Queensland, got
more and more refractory, and the field was
gradually abandoned in the 1880’s when
Croydon and other N.Q. fields showed more
attractive prospects.
* * * *
Mount Coolon, which for some time has
been the only Queensland goldfield to ma*ke
a show of regular production, and that on
a mighty small scale, has been successful
in catching the attention of the elusive
capitalist. Recently the Mt. Coolon Co.
itself granted a three months’ -working option
to the Australian Development Co., a London
concern. The directors of the Native Bear,
a near neighbor, have given a w.o. to the
same co. The two mines are among the most
important on the field, which has never had
a thorough development on modern lines.

“Oof Bird” (W.A.) ; Re the reef 12 miles
long. 10ft. wide and 3oz. rich said to
have been found years ago in Central Aus-
tralia by H. B. Lasseter. Lasseter was
picked up by an Afghan sandalcutter and
handed over to the care of a survey party,
which took him to Carnarvon. Later, at a
period estimated from one to three years,
he returned with Harding, the leader of the
survey party, and again located the reef.
The area has never been surveyed; there-
fore the exact location of the show is not
known. It is said to be more readily acces-
sible from the west than from the east.
A request to the Westralian Government for
assistance in equipping an expedition to
search for the reef was recently refused.
* * •■!=
Thomson’s recent discovery, eight miles
from Edjudina, is responding well to pre-
liminary development, which is thus far con-
fined to surface -work. Earth has been
stripped from the reef over a length of 60ft.
in the Patricia South lease, and fine and
coarse gold can be seen in the quartz. No
systematic sampling has yet been done, so
it is hard to estimate what yield to. expect
from the first parcel to be treated from the
Patricia South in July. Nevertheless it pro-
mises to be satisfactory.
* * * *
Westralia’s State batteries (there are
about 20 at present) have been very helpful
to out-back prospectors and small mine-
owners. To date they have crushed about
a million and a half tons for a yield of
£6,280,860. Capital expenditure has been
nearly half a million, and working exes,
have made off with million. These mills
have never paid their way, but without them
the treatment of the bulk of the tonnage
mentioned would have been impossible.
Two Australian owned dredges in Malaya
sat on the splice last week, and others may
be expected to follow suit. Larut is dis-
mantling its No. 3 dredge for shifting into
better ground, and Tongkah Compound No.
2 has closed down for the time being. Tong-
kali’s dredge is an old one, and much more
expensive to work than the modern plants.
Petal)ng, one of the big English shows
operating in Malaya, recently published some
interesting details in this connection. Even
with metal at last year’s prices it found
that its old dredges were exhausting ore
reserves without an adequate return, where-
as three new machines worked at half the
cost of the old ones, recovering ore which
enabled the co. to pay a 60 p.c. dividend
for 1929. So Petaling is replacing its old
gear by up-to-date plant, despite the heavy
initial cost.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) What are the prospects of Day Dawn
Blocks (New Guinea) N.L.? (2) What does
N.L. stand for? (3) I have paid the first
call, need I have done so? (4) Having done
so must I continue? (5) Do I forfeit rights
by not responding to ca115? —6545.
(1) Co. has not yet taken off its coat to
the real thing. The Sydney office is await-
ing latest report from the field, but share-
holders may have a long wait after that.
(2) and (5) No liability. Cos. in this class
are restricted to mining ventures. Share-
holders are not liable in respect of any call,
non-payment of which results in automatic
forfeiture of the scrip. (3) and (4) No.
What is the value in Sydney or Melbourne
of haematite (iron oxide) analysing iron oxide
84.6 per cent, and silica 15.4 per cent., color
first-class, ground very fine for paint? Likely
buyers in quantity? Demand? —6012.
The paint trade requires an oxide high in
ferrous content and also with a good staining
quality. If the ore is a poor “stainer” it
would be worthless even although the ferrous
content were about 90 per cent. Present
price of approved quality for paint purposes,
about £2 10s. in lump form, or £4 in powder
form, delivered Sydney. Try Frank Ham-
bridge, Bridge-street, Sydney, with a sample.
Demand limited.
(1) Much demand for free alumina? (2)
Value? (3) Will a deposit of decomposed
rock carrying 40 per cent, of free alumina
pay? (4) Will anyone buy the untreated
ore delivered’ f.0.r.? (5) People interested?
—6565.
(1) Eimited demand for it for manufacture
into sulphate of alumina. (2) Depends on
sample. (3) Not possible to say more than
that deposits of aluminous iron ore or very
ferruginous bauxite (the ore of aluminium)
in the Crookwell (N.S.W.) district have
been examined by an officer of the Mines
Department, and that, as in other parts of
the State, both quality and quantity were
found to be lacking. (4) and (5) Sulphates
Prop., Ltd., 395 Collins-street, Melbourne,
would bo the best people for you to communi-
cate with.
Any information about Mercantile Bank of
Australia, Ltd. (in liquidation) ? —7012.
The work of the liquidators has been held
up by legal problems;. these are expected to
be out of the way in a few weeks. Until
then it is not possible to say what amount,
if any, is likely to be salvaged for share-
holders.
I hold bonus certificates on life and endow-
ment policies. Each certificate states: “The
amount is payable along with, the policy at
maturity.” (1) Can bonuses be cashed? (2)
What is each £5O of bonuses worth?— 7o32.
(1) In practically all offices nowadays
bonuses have a cash value; but a common
note on the bonus certificate is: “Not a cash
bonus, but an amount payable at maturity
of policy provided said policy has been two
years in force. Until such period bonuses
cannot be dealt with in any way.” (2) Cash
value depends on the number of years before
the policy will become a claim, according to
the law of averages. If you are 30 and hold
a whole-life policy, your £5O of bonus addi-
tions are worth about £l2; if it is an
endowment policy payable at death or 50,
they are worth about £2l. When you are
49 the bonuses on that policy will be worth
about £47 12s. 6d. The amount you get is
what the office reckons will, at compound
interest, produce the amount of the bonus by
the time the policy runs out.
What arc the prospects of Pioneer Cell-
tyre Co., Ltd., of Goulburn (N.S.W,),
and have these shares any value?.- —6707.
In 1927 the Hibbert Pneumatic Cell Tyre
Co. was formed to acquire and market a
patent. Tests were made of the tyres, and
Goulburn was very well satisfied with the
results. A larger co. was formed, and shares
were scattered over the West. Further satis-
factory trials were made; and that is all the
co. seemed able to do. Mr. Hibbert put his
money into brick-works, and, after that, even
Goulburn apparently gave up hope.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
Vestus: Fair; but if safety is important
choose an older co. with proved management....
Scot: Quite good. But by sacrificing about $ per
cent, you can get public securities that carry less
risk. .. .F.N.8.: You can do much better.—J.W.L.:
A pure gamble; consult your own circumstances.
. ...K.K.R.: Take the whole-life policy; It gives
you the most cover for your money during early
years of married life; and that is the most important
consideration at that period... .A.A.H.: About 10s.
6d. for each metal is considered a fair assay fee
in Sydney. A qualitative assay would cost about
£2 12s. 6d. per sample for, say, six metals. Mel-
bourne prices about the same George E. B.: Send
details of the concentrates to Frank Hambridge, 22
Bridge-street, Sydney, who will advise you. .. .W'.F.:
Reports don’t warrant serious attention being given
by prospectors to Granite Creek (Q.) ... .C.L.J.:
(1) Well backed and liabilities well covered;, still
not an investment stock. (2) Nothing much is
likely to happen until the co. makes its first attempt
to transport heavy mining machinery by aeroplane to
its ground on the Bulolo. (3) Don’t think 50....
2011: Dispute payment of premium if you are
asked for it. There was apparently misrepresentation
and incapacity on the part of the co. to carry out
the contract when it was made... .L.8.F.: (1) Still
a gamble; and the fact that a div. has been
declared doesn’t make it a fraction less so. (2)
All gambles. (3) No F.C.8.: Don’t.

“Purple Brigadier”: Swizzle, R.M. on the
island of Rum, was a terse man, severe in
his sentences, and unfeeling in his strictures,
SETTING DAD’S MIND QUITE AT REST.
DAD: “ You’ll always look after her, large, and see she wants for nothin’.”
JARGE: “Yes, Dad. I’ll promise yer that. Mum mid Strawberry and old Bundle, too.”
and the missionary was shocked at liis
brutality—so shocked that he wrote to the
Powers that Be, and Swizzle was told offici-
ally to watch his step and unofficially to
conciliate the missionary by speaking more
kindly to malefactors brought before him.
The day after the receipt of these advices
Swizzle, well fortified by gin-slings, sat in
the judgment seat to try a notorious mur-
derer, also suspected of witchcraft. The
evidence was clear, and Swizzle, with an eye
on the missionary, delivered sentence. “In
two weeks time.” he cooed in dovelike
tones, the refreshing rains will be falling.
The birds will be putting on new plumage
and singing their love-songs to the morn
A delicious aroma of roast pig will pervade
the villages, and the plantations will glow
with verdure. All nature will rejoice. . But
as for you” (here he turned to the malefactor)
you lop-eared, _ bandy-legged, sliark-toothel
cannibal, you will be swinging in the breeze
troin the highest branch in the island! I
have spoken.” And Swizzle stamped off to
his bungalow with the air of a man who had
put the matter with consummate delicacy
and restraint.

“Wang”: The parson was staying for
the night at the Sliprails’ house. He had
to officiate at a concert in the hall three
miles down the gully that evening, and as
Dad Sliprails had a poisoned hand and
couldn’t drive, and Dave and the girls were
going to the concert on horseback, young
.Timmy, the handy boy, was deputed to
drive the parson down and bring him back
after the concert was over. The entertain-
ment seemed of interminable length to
Jimmy, and he was bored stiff with it, and
when, at a late hour, the parson announced
that Mr. McWarble woud sing “Somewhere
a Voice Is Calling,” Jimmy could contain
himself no longer. “Too right it is,” he
wailed from the back of the hall. “It’s
callin’ that it’s time t’ get th’ blarsted cows
in fer milkin’.”

“Eureka”: The union rep. was inspecting
the arrangements at the shearers’ camp and
was not at all satisfied with the water supply.
“It’s the best we can do,” Bluey, the cook,
told him. “What precautions do you take
to see that the water is pure?” the man from
the city a*sked. “Well,” says Bluey, “first of
all we boils it.” “What else?” asked the
rep. “Then we filters it,” Bluey told him.
“That’s about all the precautions you can
take, 1 suppose?” the union man said. “No,”
Bluey replied, “to be on the safe side we
drinks nothing but beer.”

“Gelt” : For many years I have marvelled
at the fact that New Guinea (Mandated
Territory) natives suffer very little from
toothache or dental trouble. Some people
say it is due to the constant mastication of
betel-nut. The laborers’ cook-boy gave me
a new line of thought the other day when
he explained that he wished to obtain the
rice ration early, in order that the rice
could be cooked and allowed to cool before
meal-time. It made their teeth no good to
eat hot rice, he explained. Subsequent
questioning elicited that natives in this ter-
ritory very rarely eat hot food. Roasted pig
is always allowed to cool; baked or boiled
taro and sweet potatoes are eaten cold: fish
is picked to pieces long after it has been
roasted on the coals. Fish soup is usually
taken hot, but only when the diner is feeling
off-color.
THE WRONG MAN.
THIRSTY: “Did yer nip th’ tall bloke?”
SOZZLED: “ Yeh, but it ain’t ’im—’e says Vs short."
“Harold Ilardupp” : Probably the greatest
surprise ever given to the Centralian abos.
was supplied by Alec Ross, a pioneer of
those parts, when, living at TJndoolya, he
shot the moon for their benefit. On account
of the trouble some of the black brethren
were causing, it was advisable to give them
a warning of the shooting possibilities of
the Martini rifle, and the news of an im-
pending eclipse of the moon offered a good
opportunity, Word was passed to the
niggers and, timing the shot to the second,
Ross fired before a good gathering. Almost
immediately the moon turned blood-red and
the blacks with howls of fear dashed for
their camps, and when a hole appeared in
the edge of the satellite they lay face down-
wards paralysed with fear. Paddy, Ross's
native horse tailer, returning from an expedi-
tion next day, heard about it and grinned
at the boss delightedly. “You bin good-fella
shooter,” he said. “Me sce-em blood every-
way longa hill.”

“Homfrey Beale”: The ’possum is ana-
thema to the rabbit-trapper by
reason of the many traps lie
gets away with. The ’possum
takes the trap up a tree and
into the hollow where he. lives,
and wears the fetter till it and
the paw or paws it is attached
to drop off. The weight doesn’t
seem to worry him. The other
day Jack Hills, a Blayney
(N.S.W.I trapper, missed a
trap from a set along Brown’s
Creek. While looking for it a
noise overhead drew his gaze
to a gum top, and there was
a ’possum over 40ft. up with the
trap, a Bunyip, depending from
its hind leg. The thing
weighed just on three pounds,
and had an extra heavy chain
attached.

“Vil N.”: Our township’s fishing club was
having a night out on the breakwater. Be-
tween drinks the conversation turned to
water horrors. There’s a lot of queer things
in the sea and we heard about most of them.
Then little Wogton the chemist, who doesn't
drink, spoke up. “I was diving unblink-
ingly into the abysmal vasthess when there
shot into view a creature encased in a trans-
parent, bivalved shell, through which I could
see its pulsating heart. Then its feathery
antennse parted and in the middle of its
head, which projected from the shell. I saw
a single eye, black and incredibly malignant
Down its sides were five pairs of waving
finny limbs, like clumsy fingers, which acted
as gills and helped the nightmare to swim.
The body ended in a spiked tail and I
glimpsed near it a curved claw. The heart
palpitated wildly; the fingers clutched at
me, the menacing claw moved, and then”
“You woke up,” chorused several beerj
voices. “No,” said Wogton. “I took mj
eye from the microscope. You chaps win:
haven’t seen a water-flea don’t know much
about the perils of the deep.”

“Wang”: Dave had just returned home
from a trip to the city, and was proudly
displaying to the family some tattooing he had
had done to him whilst on his holiday. The
design was on one of his arms, and repre-
sented a greyhound chasing a rabbit, the
latter animal careering over the shoulder.
Dad eyed the artistic effort with a frosty
eye. “Is that all yer can find t’ spend yer
money on?” he grumbled. Little Tilly crept
up, and eyed the picture in wonderment.
“Where is the rabbit running to?” she
asked with childish innocence. Dad answered
promptly. “It knows its job,” he said
sourly. “It’s makin’ fer Dave’s ear-hole. It
knows his head’s empty.”

“Cooramin”: They were talking about

“The well-known river lighter Moorara is to be
reconstructed and engined and put into the Uulf
trade.
All along the Murray,
From Wenttvortli to “the Hill,”
I know each bend and billabong,
And every home and mill.
Through many a gloomy winter
I ve dozed upon the mud;
And I ve raced across the lignum swamps
With the first October flood.
But—Gol-gol, Coltawang,
■Crawford and Kalkein,
The Look-out and Mondellamin
I’ll never see again!
I’ve loaded wool at Euston,
And at Annuello, too;
And at Narroween and Toolybut
Before Mildura grew!
I’ve watched the anabranches fill
From Kosciusko’s snow,
And poked my nose between the gums
Where few would dare to go.
But the new-sprung clover-burr
That’s had an inch of rain,
And the old-man pelicans
I’ll never see again !
They’ve towed me down the river;
They’ve towed me out to sea !
And when I've got machine insides
A coaster-bo a*t I’ll be,
And all my sister-barges
Will envy me—the sluts!—
And say, “Well, she ain’t any luck
To get them engine-guts!”
But—l’d give all the lot o’ them
To be back near Moulamein
In the cool, calm billabongs
That I’ll never see again!

“Bad Australian”: There is evidence in
favor of the contention that the Sn'ck was
at one time connected
with the mainland.
The Cape Otway dis-
trict (Yic.) closely
resembles the oppo-
site side of the Straits
in geological forma-
tion and vegetation.
The blackwoods and
the giant eucalypts—
messmate, blue gum,
peppermint, etc. —are
the same, and the
locally-named beech is
identical with the
Tas. myrtle. There
is no appreciable dif-
ference in the big
tree-ferns, dogwood,
musk, hazel and other
undergrowth, and the
open spaces carry a
heavy growth of but-
ton-grass, which, as
far as I am aware, is
found on no other
part of the mainland.
The kangaroos, walla-
bies and ’possums
show little or no
variation except in
the case of the so-
called black ’possum,
and the wombats are
the same except in
size, those of the
mainland being con-
siderably larger than
the Tassy variety.
The waters falling
into the Straits carry
the same kind of
fresh-water cels, and
the black-fish, which
should not be' con-
founded with the
small, pilchard-like
fish of the same name
once so common in
the Murray and its
tributaries. There are, of course, no thy-
lacines or “devils” on the mainland, but
the fossilised remains of both these animals
have been found on that side.

“Viau” : There isn’t much mystery about the
garamut (drum) signalling of New Guinea.
Apparently astonish-
ing feats of rapid and
long-distance trans-
mission of news admit
of a simple explana-
tion. New Guinea is
the country of the
unseen eye, the ever-
open ear and the long
tongue. At all times
and in all parts no
minute passes in
which one native does
not meet another and
exchange news, gossip
and scandal. There
is, at large, a vast
swirling volume of
general information
hovering over every
portion of land, chang-
ing only as new
scraps of information
are infused into it.
Thus the people con-
cerned have all details
of a death ready to
hand before the actual
event, and a simple
garamut signal, giving
no name or detail, is
all that is needed to
confirm known facts.
In some four years
of bush work in the
Territory I have not found any case in which
strict detail of an unexpected or sudden
event travelled faster than an ever moving
a«nd eagerly receptive chain of people could
send it by word of mouth. In the case
quoted by “Moe” (B. 19/3/’3O), details of
death in the jaws of a crocodile and the
name and location of the European victim
were known facts; the linking of the two
would enable most natives to pick the scene
of the fatality.

“Dimon” : The Wagga rug and the Mur-
rumbidgee blanket, better known to earlier
generations than to this, are not to be
despised when Jack Frost is about the
premises. The blanket, which got its name
from its common use by old “whalers” along
the Murrumbidgee and neighboring rivers, is
a bag split open, hemmed and bordered, and
does duty as a« quilt. The Wagga rug, which
originated in the same locality, is also a
split bag, but has an old woollen blanket
sewn on for lining. Both were once plenti-
ful, especially in new settlements and among
old fossickers and campers on inland river-
sides, but prosperous times pretty well pushed
them out.

“Tributer”: Is thei’e anything horses
vjon’t eat? Years ago a party of buffalo-
hunters on the Adelaide River in the N.T.
were flood-bound, with no fodder for the
horses. Geese eggs were abundant, and the
hunters engaged the natives to bring them
to the camp in canoe-loads. The eggs were
broken into the feeding buckets, and the
horses took to the diet with relish and throve
on it.

“E.S.”: In the days of land selection
before survey, selectors had fine pickings,
but their methods of measurement were
sketchy. Supplejack had picked a nice
patch of thin forest, stuck a peg in one
corner, then, watch in hand, waited for the
tick of noon to strike along the peg’s shadow
for a true north a*nd south line. He
stepped the distance to the next corner,
where he squared the block by the square
of his shoulders, and so on till he got back
to his starting-point. He carefully cut out a
sandhill and a swampy patch as useless, and
included a nice little rise near his north-
ern boundary for a building site. He and
Stringybark were selecting together, and
when Supplejack won the toss for the
rise, Stringybark was consoled by the in-
clusion of a small lagoon at the bottom of
what he called his back paddock. When the
surveyor came along the theodolite revealed
some awful angles and upset the calculations
of both. It shifted the rise into Stringy-
bark’s block and gave Supplejack both
the sandhill and the swampy patch he didn’t
want, while Stringybark’s back line just
missed the lagoon. Stringybark said it was
all through Supplejack’s watch being slow;
and they didn’t speak for three years.

CROP DISEASES—WHY?
“Hortus”: I read tha*t onion-growers are
complaining that diseases are attacking their
crops, and that gumming disease is again
prevalent in the cane ai*ba<s. What is the
root of the trouble in both these cases?
Using the same ground year in and year
out for the same crop.
The “continuous wheat experiment”
carried out at Cowra* (N.S.W.) is well
worth reconsidering. In 1906 three plots
were prepared; No. 1 was devoted to wheat-
every-year, No. 2 to wheat-after-bare-fallow
and No. 3 to wheat-after-fallow. The best
seed was used and the greatest care given
to cultivation methods. In 1910 wild oats a*nd
Saucy Jack appeared in No. 1. In 1912 the
manager reported that “but little wheat is
taken from No. 1 plot, and the weeds have
become a menace to the cleared adjoining
areas.” In six years, therefore, the crop
was practically ruined.
What happens to wheat applies to other
crops, but the latter are affected in, perhaps,
other ways. Crops like onions and Sugar
cane, being large feeders and consequently
exuding more poisonous matter, become
diseased in themselves and the returns suffer.
There is no real remedy for crops smitten
with disease on land continuously used by
them without change. Some advocate lim-
ing and it may do some good. The only thing
for it is rotation.
It is best, of course, to change the crop
every year, but some farmers arc not in a.
position to do so. I should advise in these
cases a scheme of gradual rotation. Divide
the cultivation area into four sections:
A, B, C, D. Sow down A, B and C with the
desired crop, and either let D lie fallow or
use part of it for something else suitable
to the climate and general conditions. Fallow
A, B and C in the same way, so that each
section is fallowed every fourth year. There
is nothing wrong with fallow as rotation.
In the Cowra experiment the wheat-after-
bare-fallow plot averaged 24.8 bushels,
whereas the wlieat-after-fodder averaged only
1.6 bushels more. So with a little less area
under crop, each section gains the benefit
of improved soil conditions, an improved
moisture supply for the growth of bac-
teria, which indirectly leads to significant
quantities of plant foods being rendered avail-
able for the crop. Weeds also a*re con-
trolled and eliminated from competition with
the crop (an important point) for supplies of
moisture and minerals.
It would not be out of place here to
refer to the published results of experiments
carried out at the Merredin (W.A.) experi-
ment farm. In April (about nine months
after the ploughing) the fallowed plot, which
received five cultivations, contained nearly
1101 b. more nitrate-nitrogen per acre than the
corresponding unfallowed plots. This is
equivalent to 5501 b. of sulphate of ammonia,
or 7101 b. of nitrate of soda*. In April the
fallowed plot contained a greater amount of
moisture than others; the equivalent was
nearly 14in. of rain distributed through the
soil to a depth of three feet. The enormous
increase of nitrate-nitrogen in the fallowed
plots was due to the favorable tilth of soil
and the improved moisture conditions during
summer and autumn. The crop yield on the
unfallowed plot was only 73 per cent, of
that on the fallow—l 6 bushels 61b. as
compared with 22 bushels 131 b. The lesson
of these Westralian experiments is: Study
the soil more; give it every possible chance
by “spelling” it, and reap the reward of a
better harvest and no disease worries.
LOSSES IN DIPriNG.
“Trepex” : There a*re two chief causes of
losses in sheep-dipping—(l) failure to mix
the dip in accordance with manufacturers’
prescription; (2) faulty handling of the
sheep. The first error is easily rectified ; the
second requires more study and care.
Overcrowding in the yards must be avoided.
Otherwise of the sheep are bound to
be crushed. And, even if the injury is only
slight and temporary, it unfits the poor
beast for its coming ordeal. An injured
sheep suffers in strength and vitality, and
will be trodden under water in the tank by
some, of its fellows. The entrance to the
tank itself is sometimes a source of trouble.
The sloping board arrangement, with _ the
plunge at the end, may mean one strong animal
jumping into the midst of those already in
the water, so pushing one or more of them
completely underneath. With the tip-plat-
form contrivance, trouble is begged for ; jamb-
ing and struggling in the water are bound
to ensue. Complete submergence is to be
avoided, and the sheep should be given a
chance to get through without any knocks
or strains.
“Quietly does it” should be the watch-
word at dipping-time.
FUEL-SAVING 6UT BACK.
“Kripple”: Casual engine-drivers picked
up for shearing, pumping or other short-
time jobs are rarely economical, or lack
knowledge to give best results. It is not
sufficient for a man to keep the- wheels going
round. Cases are numerous, particularly at
sheds having steam for the motive power,
and where six-, eight- or ten-horsepower
engines are doing three-, four- or five-horse-
power jobs on settings suitable to the higher
power, where, by a simple adjustment of the
slide valve—for which provision is generally
made —large quantities of precious water
and fuel could be saved.
Slack off the clamp bolt securing the
eccentric sheave to the block on the crank-
shaft and reset so that the slide valve cuts
off steaA at 4, § or f stroke, according
to load, thus allowing steam to continue
expansively. The earlier the cut-off, con-
sistent with sufficient power, the greater the
saving. Many old-time sheds where the
number of machines in use have been largely
reduced have the same old engine working
on the same old setting, when the foregoing
tip could be profitably applied. If in doubt
how to proceed, get the machinery inspector
on his next visit round to show you how.
Where oil-engines are in use, don’t have
them racing along at 450 to 500 revs, when
the work could be done comfortably at 350
to 400. A judicious arrangement of pulleys
allied to speed-setting spells economy. On
the other hand, if the engine labors a little,
speeding up may give you the extra bit of
power required provided the engine is not
too small for the job.
FATTENING SHEEP BY HAND.
“Fysh”: A neighbor in our Queensland
district bought a small line of cross-bred
store sheep off dry country at 10s. 6d. He
trough-fed them for six weeks on oats and
chaff grown on the place, and this topped
them off so well that he realised 41s. 6d.
for them. The first fortnight they received
41b. each of chaff and oats per head per day,
the amount being raised to fib. of each for
the rest of the time. The market value of
the food consumed by each sheep was 4s. 3d.,
leaving a gross profit of 265. 9d. per sheep.
Even with freight and commission taken out
the result was eminently satisfactory, and
the farmer intends to go on with the good
work.
AFRICAN VELDT GRASS.
“Garrabarra”: A Queensland experiment
with an introduced grass may be worth men-
tioning. African Veldt grass (Ehrharta caly-
cina) was planted in April, 1929, in a poor,
sandy soil after seven inches of rain during
the preceding month. It shot about a week
after planting. There was little rain through
the winter; about two inches fell in the late
spring and early summer of 1929.
The grass grew well, seeded and grew
again. The dry period of 1929-30 brought
it to a standstill, as it did the native
grasses. There were days with a few points
of rain during the early months of 1930;
after every little shower the grass responded
well, but early in May it had every appear-
ance of being dead. Then came three inches
of rain, which has given it a new lease
of life. Fresh seed is growing and the growth
from the old butts has outstripped every-
thing else in the same line. The grass
blades are eight to nine inches in height,
fresh, soft and succulent-looking.
The plot is only small, but on this show-
ing this African grass should merit a trial
in arid and semi-arid regions.
RINGBARKING IN QUEENSLAND.
“Columbus”: The Bulletin controversy
on the effects of ringbarking came at an
appropriate time, particularly to Queens-
landers, in view of their Government’s action
in removing anomalous legislation discourag-
ing this means of land improvement.
Formerly ringbarking as an improvement,
in cases of resumption, was held to depre-
ciate at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum,
and in no case could be valued at more
than 2s. 6d. per acre. Thus, after a decade,
when the benefits of axe-work are becoming
mo-st appreciable, the originator was allowed
no compensation for his expenditure. This
absurdity is now removed, and encourage-
ment to ringbark is given in the way of
extended leases and other concessions, whilst
financial assistance is also promised when
money is available.
The drain on shallow subterranean water
by green timber is enormous. One large
tree will account for some hundreds of
gallons per week. The erosion which would
result from the destruction, of the root-
systems is counteracted by increased growth
of grass. But; it is in the sweetening and
improved feeding capacity of the country
that the real benefit lies. It is a sound
axiom that country which will grow big
timber will grow anything, and the benefit
to grasses when the forest sustenance is
diverted, together with humus, potash, etc.,
from decayed or burnt timber, is obvious. It
will be generally found that the capacity of
average Queensland forest is at least doubled
by ringing, and tha*t at a few shillings per
acre, without additional' watering, fencing
and overhead charges.
A case in point is the so-called ‘ desert
country of C.Q., where little more than
experimental ringbarking has yet been done,
because men of means have been attracted
by the open downs further out. These areas
are ordinarily rated at one sheep to five,
acres. Experiments indicate that ringing
brings the capacity up to that of the downs,
and the appearance of new soft grasses is
astonishing. A further advantage held by
forest country is that usually a fair pro-
portion of the timber and bushes is edible.
THE USEFUL KURRAJONG.
“Wiandit”: I agree with “U. Murray” (B.
14/5/’3O) as to the virtues of the kurrajong ;
and there is one he did not mention* When
feeding sheep or cattle on kurrajong you
can use inferior scrubs with it; for example,
blue-leaf ironbark, mountain brigalow and
tea-tree, which are not much good on tlieir
own. _. .
Here’s a hint when transplanting. Pick
an old tree and lop all the branches pretty
short, leaving no leaf at all. Choose showery
weather, don’t put any manure in the hole
with it, and don't have the soil too fine.
When he’s in, keep the water up to him.
TREE SURGERY.
“X.5.A.”: Fruit and other trees which
have been ringbarked by hares or rabbits
may be saved by bridge-grafting. This is
a simple operation which serves to maintain
a flow of sap across the ring until the bark
grows over and covers the wound.
The upper and lower barks are connected
by “bridges” of young wood, these being in-
serted into the green and healthy bark above
and below the barked portion. Scions for
this purpose should be taken from wood of
the previous season’s growth, and the opera-
tion performed while the tree is dormant.
They should be cut a little longer than the
space to be bridged, with a bevel on each
end to face outwards. They are then
slipped into vertical cuts above and below
the gap, bound round tightly, and waxed to
keep water out. The necessary number
varies according to girth of the tree or size
of the barking, but. about 4in. apart will
generally do. In time the bark will grow
over and cover the whole, merging into the
original bark.
When cutting out decayed or injured or
diseased wood, care must be taken to sterilise
and waterproof the wounds so that they will
not suffer through decay. If left open, the
wounds will be exposed to an attack of
fungi, besides which they will be weakened
by the shock. Orchardists should consider
the structure and physiology of their trees.
All wounds (and pruning comes under that
category) should be watched and given im-
mediate attention if troubles ensue. Tools
should be sharp, clean and sterilised. Weak
formalin is good for this purpose, and will
kill the bacteria, spores, etc., which might
otherwise be spread from tree to tree.
When protecting the cuts on healthy trees,
ordinary white lead will do, but when dis-
eased parts have been cut away, an anti-
septic, such as coal tar or creosote, is neces-
sary. I prefer creosote. It is sometimes
necessary to fill a cavity, thus preventing
an extension of rot. When this happens all
dead and diseased wood must be cut away,
the walls treated with _ creosote and a mix-
ture of cement (1 to 3 in clean sand) firmed
into the cavity. Trees which might other-
wise snap off will thus be strengthened.
It is important always to cut well into
the healthy bark or wood. Try to leave
as small as possible a surface to be healed
over.
ONE CITRUS GROWER TO ANOTHER.
“Armadale”: The performance of
“X.o.A.’s” citrus grower (B. 30/4/’3O), who,
with the aid of a crippled lad, does all the
work on a 22-acre orchard producing 5000
bushels annually, is outstanding- It IS ' Pi?"
bably not bettered anywhere in Austrain
nor equalled in this State (Westralia;.
“X.5.A.” would be doing a big service t
citrus growers generally by publishing some
of his man’s methods. I am trying to im-
prove my own, and have enlisted the ant oi
The Bulletin’s Service Department, among
others, with hopeful results. Still, though
.not a front-ranker amongst citrus growers,
I don’t think I’m a dud. My production per
tree and price per bushel are both above
State and Commonwealth averages, and 1
believe I hold the record for prices realised
for Australian oranges on the London mar-
ket ; namely: Navels. 30s. per f-bushel case ;
Valencia, 28s. per f-bushel case; Joppa-, _os.
per f-bushel case.
There are several things I should like to
know about “X.S.A.’s” grower :—-
(1) What is the rainfall during the three
main marketing months, .Tune, July, August V
In our district in 1926 it was 23in.: in
1927, 22in.; in 1928, 29in. In July, 1928,
loin, fell, which meant that practically the
whole of the fruit picked during that month
had to be dried.
(2) 'What quantity of rain generally falls
between the end of blossoming and the com-
mencement of marketing? This has. an im-
portant bearing on the working of an
orchard. In two recent summers we had
spells of six and four months without any
rain above a few points. _
(3) Into how many grades does “X.S.A.V’
friend sort his fruit? I market (and brand)
three, the number shown in a market report
of the Vic. Central Cit. Assoc, which I saw
a year or two ago.
(4) What is the mean difference in each
size packed? With me it is Jin.
(5) How many bushels of windfalls drop
in a week (peak period)? Are they all
picked up? If so, how long does it take
each time? If not, what happens to them?
On this place (area about 9 acres) about
30-40 bushels drop in a week, though a bad
storm might bring down 100 bushels. They
are picked up twice a week, each job taking
over a day.
Most of the foregoing relate to local con-
ditions. Other useful items of interest,
which would come under the heading of local
management and might be more or less
applicable anywhere, would be : Size of shed
necessary for quantity of fruit handled,
number of sizes in sizing machine (presum-
ably one is used), implements and number of
horses.
Considering the limited area of suitable
land (with good conditions) available, the
prospects for citrus look brighter than for
a good many other primary products.
FRUIT TREES TO SPECIFICATION.
“Hop Scrub” : All our fruit trees, apples
excepted, are worked on seedling stocks.
Experimental results indicate that there is
much variation in seedling stocks, and that
the stocks cause remarkable disparities in
the growth of varieties budded pn to them.
In an endeavor to secure standardisation
of tree stocks the experimenters are using
stocks propagated vegetatively by cuttings
or layers, thereby eliminating, one great
cause of seedling variation —cross-fertilisa-
tion. With standardised stocks coupled with
the selection of buds from trees of good
growth and fruiting habit, the growers would
be a bit nearer “factory” production. Soil
and climate conditions cause sufficient varia-
tion in growth without adding another, in
the shape of seedling stocks.
Not every grower is inclined to do his
own propagation, but any reputable nursery-
man will not only supply varieties prescribed,
but if given an order well ahead will secure
buds from high-production strains and work
them on any stock the grower cares to
specify. It would be to the advantage of
both parties if trees were built-to specifica-
tion from the underground up.
OPEN DAMS.
“Bunny’’: Open dams are. a curse, particu-
larly to the dairy-farmer. It is bad enough
for the water to lie stagnant for 12 months—
in dry times, it may be for two or three
years—but every beast that comes to drink
walks into the dam, stirs up the. mud. and
adds further pollution before leaving. Every
dairy cow requires 10 gallons of water a
day, but it must be good water. All the feed
in the world won't make them thrive if
the water is bad.
Dirty dams, especially when they are
nearly empty, are the cause of more sick-
ness in cows —fever, mammitis, caked udder
and stringy milk especially—than all other
causes put together. The udder is tender
and susceptible to ills, yet cows are habitu-
ally allowed to drag their udders through
these pools of filth. A neighbor of mine
was deprived of the services of 10 of his
best milkers this season through caked
udder and fever: three died and the others
lost quarters and went right off their milk.
As soon as he changed them from a filthy

Cyclone Ring-Lock Farm
Fences are made in several
heights and with various
spacings of wire to suit all
classes of stock.
ORIPPED0 RIPPED in the vice-like hold of the “Cyclone”
Ring-Lock, the heavy upright wires are clamped
to the line wires and cannot be moved upwards,
sideways or down.
“Cyclone” Ring-Lock Farm Fences are machine-made
from heavy galvanized HARD-DRAWN Steel wire
and will not stretch, sag or rust.
It’s impossible for sheep or any stock to bend the fence
upwards and scramble through, as the stiff upright
stays hold the cross wires taut and firm.
“Cyclone” Ring-Lock Farm Fences are cheaper and
easier to erect and last longer than a plain wire fence
with droppers.
Consider these facts, then post the coupon for a free
illustrated “Cyclone” Catalogue.

dam to well water there was no fresh infec-
tion, and mild cases soon recovered.
_The dam should be enclosed and a wind-
mill or pump put on it, or the water syphoned
out by a pipe through or over the bank. In
most cases this should be easy; 90 per cent,
of dams are on a slope.
\ •"
A STEAMER for pig feed.
“Fysh” : One of the drawbacks in cooking
ground grain for pigs is that one lias to
stand over it to prevent the feed scorching.
Any farmer can easily fix up a device which
will do away with this trouble.
Make a false wooden bottom to fit your
boiler, perforate it with a number of lin.
holes—the more the better, as long as you
do not unduly weaken it. Erect a piece of
2in. pipe perpendicularly through the centre
of the false bottom—it should project about
din. below the bottom of the wood so as
to provide room for the water. At the upper
end of this pipe a perforated cap is fitted;
cover the false bottom with wire gauze.
Put this! device in the boiler, pour in water
to about the level of the false bottom and
add enough dry feed to leave about two
inches of the pipe and cap projecting.
When the water begins to boil, the steam
forces it up through the pipe with sufficient
force to spray it over the entire surface
of the feed. It seeps down through the
feed, filters through’ the gauze and repeats
the operation again and again till the feed
is thoroughly cooked.
The contrivance not only prevents the feed
burning but cooks it much more evenly. It
requires no attention at all except for replen-
ishing the fire at intervals.
A HANDY TIN-CUTTER.
“Brady’s Lookout”: If you want a tool
to cut galvanised iron or tin you can soon
make one, if you have an old chaff cutter
knife about the farm.
First sharpen the knife to a good edge ;
then get two pieces of sawn hardwood,
each 4ft. 6in. in length and 2in. by ljin.
Place the two pieces side by side in a vyce,
exactly level, with the narrow sidqs upper-
most, and bore both together with a fin.
bit—at 4in. from one end, at Bin. from first
hole, at 16in, from second hole, at 20in.
from third hole. These measurements are
for an 18in. knife, measured from point to
point of the curve.
Now run the bolts (3in. x fin.) through
the two pieces of wood, placing an ordinary
washer on the first bolt and between the
pieces of wood. Run the second bolt through
the end hole of the knife, with the knife
between the wood. In the same way place
a washer on the third bolt; the fourth bolt
will not need a washer. Then through the
two holes in the free end of the knife bolt
a hard wooden handle so set that the end of
the handle is 9in. back from the end of the
knife, and 3in. above the frame when the
knife is down and resting on the third bolt.
If this isn’t done your knuckles will suffer
when working.
Now get two pieces of hoop- or strap-iron,
each 19in. long, and drill near edges to take
ordinary box nails—a very slight counter
sink will leave a level surface. Nail hoop-
iron to top surface of frame so that the
knife works freely between them; and you
are set.
Mark with straight edge and pencil the iron
(corrugated or plain) you want to cut, feed
it in under the knife with one hand and
cut with the other, the frame lying on the
ground. You can cut corrugated at any
angle with this tool. I have had one in use
for over 20 years and it is still going strong.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) How to poison coola-bah (■snc'kers and
young trees)? (2) Ditto gum? (3) What
poison, and quantities? (4) Wliat time of
year? (5) Can brigalow be poisoned?—
6933.
(1), (2) and (3) Young eucalypts and
suckers of same may be destroyed by cutting
the growth off close to the ground with a
V-shaped cut and immediately swabbing the
cut surfaces with a 30 per cent, solution of
arsenic pentoxide (31b. to the gallon of
water). For ordinary frilling and poisoning
a 20 per cent, solution of arsenic pentoxide
should be effective. (4) Immediately after
the trees have finished their maximum growth
for the season. Under ordinary conditions
March and April are the best months and
the period may extend into the middle of
May in some localities. (5) Yes; if done at
the right time of the year. In all cases
poison should be applied as soon as the axe
has been used. In the case of suckers, two
or three quick swabbings are advisable to
ensure a good absorption of the poison.
(1) How to grow a laurel hedge for
shelter? (2) What sort of pine-tree to
plant for shelter?—' 66B2.
(1) If in a cold district, plant English
laurel, 4ft. apart, in well-dug ground. If in
a warm district, plant camphor laurel, Bft.
apart. (2) Finns insignis.
What variety of grapes should be grown
in volcanic soil? —6663.
Practically any variety can be grown in
volcanic soil, but drying varieties are better
suited to irrigated areas. Climatic condi-
tion is a big factor in determining whether
vines should be grown.
I propose to buy 20 acres in the Windsor
district (N.S.W.), jetting half in citrus
fruit and half in tomatoes. (1) Which is
most profitable , oranges or lemons? (2)
What are the most profitable strains? (3)
What are the average returns for tomatoes
per acre? (4) How many trees ( orange
and lemon) per acre? —644s.
(1) On the river fiats oranges are gener-
ally most suitable and profitable. On the
higher levels, other conditions being suit-
able, lemons could be profitably grown. (2)
Oranges, Washington Navel and Late
Valencia; lemons, Sweet Rind. (3) Tomato
pulping firms usually contract at a price
of about £7 or £8 per ton. On the good soils
in the Windsor district it should be possible
to secure a yield of 8 to 10 tons per acre.
The returns from early tomatoes are usually
much higher, but a very large area cannot
be cultivated if the plants are to be pruned
and staked. (4) If on the river flats, where
the soil is rich, the citrus trees should be
planted 24ft. apart—7s trees to the acre.
On the higher lands, where the soil is some-
what poor, they should be planted 20ft.
apart—loS trees to the acre.
(1) Symptoms of eelworm scab in
potatoes? (2) Control measures? —6904.
(1) Tubers affected show a large number
of small pimple-like outgrowths on the sur-
face, with a slight depression round each
pimple. Just below the pimple there is a
darkened ring in the flesh which can be
seen when the tuber is cut open. In the
centre of the discolored a«rea a small glisten-
ing body about the size of a pin-point may
sometimes be observed. This is the female
eelworm. In severe cases of infection the
tubers become warty, roughened and dis-
colored, necessitating considerable wastage in
peeling for table use. (2) Avoid the use of
affected tubers for seed and boil them before
feeding to stock. Practise rotation of crops
and avoid growing susceptible plants con-
tinuously on the same land. Crops resis-
tant to eelworm include the cereals and
grasses, certain American varieties of cow-
peas and velvet beans. Onions and peanuts
are also fairly resistant. Cultivate clean
areas before proceeding to areas which are
known to be infested. Drying out the soil
or flooding is usually fatal to young eel-
worms in a comparatively short time, and
fallowing two years usually kills off the
pest.
(1) What is the cause of my fowls yawn-
ing? (2) Is it a forerunner to diseaset (3)
What treatment? (4) What are sharps ? —
6729.
(1) May be caused by worms in the
throat; some obstruction, such as a seed
lodged in the throat, or by an accumulation
of pus or matter caused by a cold. (2)
If due to a cold it may develop into roup.
(3) Take one of the affected birds to the
Veterinary Institute, Flemington-road, Park-
ville (Vic.), and have the trouble diagnosed.
(41 Sharps is the term used in England to
identify the mill offal known in Australia
as pollard, but it is much superior to most
pollard produced in Vic.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Wescocky”: A handy tool for clearing
rubbish from the tines when cultivating or
combine drilling can be made from a hay-
fork, handle or a sapling about 7ft. long.
Take a Hn. bit and bore two holes through
the thick end—one, say, 4in. and the other
13in. from the end. * Next get a |in. iron rod,
about 2ft. 6in. long, or a hay-rake wheel
spoke; thrust it through the hole at 13in.
and bend it past the handle into the shape of
a hook. Secure with a wire hitch through
the hole nearest the end.
“Flor”: There is an easier way than
“Grouper’s” (B. 14/5/’3O) of extracting an
axe-handle. If it is broken, saw or chop it
off close to the axehead and stand same on
blocks leaving the socket free, sawn end up.
On that end place a square bolt-nut of a
size to just go through. One smack with
the poll of an axe will generally. start the
handle-end enough for a short length of
hardwood to finish the job; if it does not,
follow the first nut with another.
“Red on Black”: Reckon up the time
spent in washing teats and cleaning bails
caused by muddy cowyards. Then reckon up
the loss' caused by cows standing belly-
deep in mud on a cold winter morning and
you have a good idea why the cowyard
should be kept clean. The so-called mud is
for the most part well rotted manure. By
using a scoop you can quickly move it to
a cultivation paddock.
“Wrasli” : Red polls in the dairy herd have
advantages over other breeds. The average
maximum age at which ordinary cows yield
best is eight years, but some of the red poll
heaviest milkers are 12 years or over. They
are singularly free from tuberculosis, and
with gentle handling become very tractable.
They are hardy doers in times of fodder scar-
city.
“J.H.A.” : The orehardist who can afford
it should buy a truck of shooks. In Vic-
toria they ca*n be bought now for Gkl. each
and can be made up during wet weather at
a low cost; lewt. of nails is sufficient
for 1300. All that is necessary besides
is a bench or table with parallel slats nailed
down to hold the case ends, a hammer and
elbow grease.
“Cuchulain”: These frosty nights it pays
to carry a ball of twine or wool in pocket
or gardening apron. Lettuce beginning to
heart and cauliflowers to form can be tied
up, the leaves being gathered over the heart
and tied loosely. This protects the hearts
from frost, makes them form moi*e quickly '
and keeps them clean.
“Bonzo”: A substitute for soldering tin
utensils. Clean off dirt or oily matter round
edge of hole; apply a thick coat of paint;
paint a piece of canvas or flourbag and place
painted side on part of vessel already
treated; then paint well over the back of the
patch to make it adhere. Let the paint dry
hard. A hole in a tank may be mended in
this way except that hot tar must be used
instead of paint, and sugarbag for the patch.
Treat inside of tank the same as outside.
“Goomarin”: Eggs are rejected for export
by the Commonwealth inspector because they
are dirty, stale, or have broken, unsound or
abnormal shells. Remedies: Keep your
laying boxes clean and your fowls in good
health, and don’t overfeed —that causes blood-
spots. Shell-grit won’t always remedy thin-
shelled eggs; five per cent, of bonemeal in
the daily mash will.
“Disc Hari’ow”: After drilling holes in a
block of metal that cannot be conveniently
turned over, the best way to extract the chips
is by 'a magnet. Get a screw smaller than the
hole and allow it to cling to the magnet; it
will explore the hole and clean up all the
chips.
“Fysh”: It is an exasperating job to hang
a carcase of a sheep or pig on the ordinary
gambel; it usually slides to one side at a
touch. This can be fixed by making a double
hook. Any piece of round iron can be bent
to the required shape in a vyee or over an
anvil. Hang the hook over the beam, their
place the gambel in position on the carcase,
and lift it up on the hook.

in South Africa. Seed has been tried from
N.S.W,, but it is said that most of the seed
is obtained from eastern Tas. and western
Vic. (4) It is found that the treeless,
grassy highlands of Natal are specially suit-
able for wattle culture. Also there is an
abundance of cheap labor available.
(1) Is it possible to become a barrister
or solicitor without attending a uni.? (2)
If so, how could one qualify? (3) How long
would the course of study take? —6831.
(1) Yes. (2) In the case of a barrister
by passing a preliminary (literary) exam-
ination and Intermediate and Final exam-
inations in law. These examinations cover
all branches of law, including Roman, inter-
national and constitutional. In the case of
a solicitor, a term of articles, five years, has
to be served, and examinations in all the
principal branches of law passed. (3) Five
years at least for solicitors; in the case of
barristers it would depend largely on the
student’s native ability—but probably four
or five years, and not less than three.
What duties are performed by the S.A.
Dept, of Chemistry? Does it carry out any
beneficial research work, and are progress
reports of its work issued? —6875.
It is principally engaged in general routine
chemical examinations and analyses for
various Govt, departments, but the chemical
investigation of local products and industries
forms an important branch of its work. The
dept, administers the Gas Act, the Inflam-
mable Oil Acts, and the provisions of the
Marine Board and Navigation Act relating
to explosives. At first the dept, issued
bulletins, of which nine have been published,
but since 1918 the results of investigations
made have been embodied in the reports of
the Advisory Council of Science and Indus-
try of S.A.
(1) On what grounds can imported films
be rejected or “cut” by the Commonwealth
Film Censors? (2) How is the censorship
l>oard constituted? (3) How many films
passed intact last year, and how many were
cut or rejected? —6B49.
(1) No film can be registered which in the
opinion of the censor is (a) blasphemous,
indecent or obscene; (b) likely to be in-
jurious to morality, or to encourage or incite
to crime; (c) likely to be offensive to the
people of any friendly nation; (d) likely to
be offensive to the people of the British
Empire; or (e) depicts any matter the
exhibition of which is undesirable in the
public interests. (2) There is a censorship
board of three persons and an appeal board
of the same number, the headquarters of
both being in Sydney. Importers have the
right of appeal to the Minister. (3) In 1928
(latest figures available) films numbering
1492 passed without eliminations, 420
passed after eliminations, and 58 were re-
jected.
(1) What value in house property is a
person in receipt of an invalid pension
allowed to hold? (2) Must the pensioner
reside in or on the property? (3) What
amount • in cash may a pensioner possess?
(4) If receiving £1 per week, what amount
may a pensioner earn? —6659.
(1) and (2) If permanently residing
within the house property, same is exempt
irrespective of its value. Where applicants
have property valued at £4OO or over in
which they do not permanently reside a
pension would not be payable. (3) £5O. (4)
There must be no earnings.
I am thinking of putting on the market
an indigestion remedy composed of non-
poisonous ingredients, (1) Would I have
to register it under the N.B.W. Drugs or
Pure Food Act? (2) How much would} this
cost? (3) Where could I secure information
regarding trade-marks? —0605.
(1) The giving of a guarantee under the
Pure Food Act is optional. Application
should be made to the Receiver, the Trea-
sury, Sydney, who will supply forms and
information. (2) No charge. (3) Patents
and Trade Marks Office, Martin-place,
Sydney.
What are the chances of securing a posi-
tion in the New i Guinea police? To whom
should I apply, and personally or hy letter?
—6765.
No vacancies at present. In the event of
further appointees being required, vacancies
will be advertised in daily newspapers in
Australian capitals, stating form of appli-
cation.
Would rain descending to the ground, at
an angle (such as during a strong wind)
register a less amount in a gauge than what
actually fell?- —6880.
Yes, if the wind were very strong. To
obviate this, gauges should be sheltered by
walls, which should, however, be not higher
than the distance between the gauge and the
foot of the shelter.
(1) What is the training necessary to en-
able a 14-t/ ear-old hoy attending first year
at a commercial school to become an indus-
trial chemist? (2) Is a uni. course neces-
sary, and cost? (3) What are the pros-
pects of the profession? —6so3.
(1) Continue the present course of school
training up to the intermediate standard and
include amongst other subjects elementary
science. If successful at the intermediate
certificate exam., studies should be continued
up to leaving certificate exam. (2) Not
absolutely essential, though desirable. Fees
amount to £lO5 for the three years’ science
course. A satisfactory course is provided at
the Technical College, where the fees amount
to 50s. per annum for three lessons per
week. For the diploma course the charge is
£3 3s. per annum. (3) An excellent calling
for a lad with scientific bent; for a searcher
and student. Opportunities for placement
are at the present time remote, but will
undoubtedly increase. Salary and working
conditions are in the majority of instances
attractive.
(1) I have a rambling rose about two
years old (grown from slip) which does not
bloom. What’s the remedy? (2) Name of
a rambling rose that will bloom freely in this
climate (Maryborough, Q.)f (3) A book
on rose culture for the novice? —6656.
(1) Probably it is making very vigorous
growth, which would delay blooming till the
second or third year. (2) Crimson
Rambler does splendidly. Other good varie-
ties are Paul’s Scarlet Climber, Royal
Scarlet Hybrid and The Beacon. (3)
“Modern Roses in Australia,” by B. V.
Rossi, 10s. 6d.
What constitutes the demand for trochus
shell? What is its appearance and where is
it obtained? —6900.
It is a top-shaped shell, about 3in. high,
colored with broad stripes of alternate red
and white, beneath which is solid mother-of-
pearl. It was formerly abundant on the
coral reefs of Northern Australia, but
through vigorous collecting has become com-
paratively scarce. It is used for the
manufacture of “pearl” buttons, principally
in Japan, and in some cases the mollusc
which it houses is smoked and exported
to Oriental countries.
How to harden bitumen so as to prevent
it from being softened or liquefied by heat ?
—6710.
Depends on thickness. If it was only Jin.
thick, a dusting of fine dry sand would
harden it; if it was lin. it would be neces-
sary to melt the bitumen, adding blue metal
screenings of Jin. gauge to dust, lay while
still hot, and finish off surface with fine
sftnd. Should a greater thickness than lin.
be required, it would be necessary to lay a
base course of hot bitumen and blue metal
of from 5-16 in. to fin. gauge and then finish
off with the lin. course as described.
IJow to mould rubber tops? —666o. _
The rubber is put into the mould in the
form of a dough and vulcanised for a certain
period according to the quantity of the dough
used. It is a job for an expert equipped
with elaborate machinery.
(1) Number of war pensions paid in
respect of members of the Aust. forces?
Amount paid in war pensions annually ?
(3) Cost of paying such pensions? —662B.
(1) For the year'ended June 30, 1929,
war pensions were paid to 73,436 incapaci-
tated members of the forces, 36,182 depen-
dants of deceased members and 163,013
dependants of incapaeited members. .(2)
7,734,921. (3) Close on £200,000.
In what manner can an alteration be made
in the 'Commonwealth Constitution? —6626.
Firstly an amending Act must be passed by
an absolute majority of eacli House of
Parliament; then not less than two months,
nor more than six months after its passage
it must be submitted to the electors, or it
either House refuses to accept an amending
bill twice passed by the other House, after an
interval of three iponths, the proposed law
may be sent on to the electors by the
Governor-General. To become effective, the
referred proposal must be accepted by (a)
a majority of all electors voting, and (b)
a> majority of the States. Furthermore any
amendment affecting the provisions of the
Constitution in regard to any particular
State ( e.g., altering its proportion of repre-
sentation or affecting its territorial limits)
must also be accepted by a majority of
electors in the State affected.
(1) How long does it take for wood to
petrify? (2) Which four horses rank as the
greatest stake-winners in Australia, and the
amounts? (3) At a country race meeting
a horse went out with a wrong number on
its saddle-cloth and .Should it have
been disqualified? (4) In four-hand crib-
bage A plays 2, B plays 4, C plays 3 and
takes run of 3; D plays 1 and takes run
of 4; A plays 5 and takes run of 5 ; B plays
6 and takes run of 6. Is that correct? —
6654.
(1) Impossible to say. Probably some
hundreds of thousands of years. (2) Up
to end of 1929 season: Heroic, £38,062;
Eurythmic, £36,891; Windbag, £35,936;
David, £31,410. Amounis is now on top
with £40,693. Gloaming won £43,100, but not
all of it in Australia. (3) No protest can
stand because a horse goes out with the
wrong number, but his connections are liable
to fine or censure. (4) Yes, so far as the
runs are concerned, but A should also get
two points for completing 15.
What is the largest ship afloat? The
Americans claim that the Leviathan is the
biggest. The White Star line ( British)
advertises that its ship the Majestic leads
the world, —6Bsl.
It is a matter of different standards of
measurement. According to U.S.A. rules, the
Leviathan, which is Bft. shorter than the
Majestic, has a tonnage of 59,957. The
Majestic is rated, according to British rules,
at 56,621 tons. If the Majestic were
measured on U.S.A. rules her tonnage would
be 61,206, and if the Leviathan were put
under the same calliper she would be assessed
at 54,282 tons.
(1) How much wheat did U.S.A. produce
for the. last year for which figures are avail-
able, and what is the average annual yield?
(2) Yield per acre same year, and average
annual yield per acre? (3) How much Can-
adian wheat is exported through U.S.A.
ports ?• —6895.
(1) In 1927 U.S.A. produced 871,705,000
bushels of wheat. Average of the three
years ending 1926 was 790,501,000 bushels.
(21 In 1927 average yield per acre was 14.88
bushels; average annual yield per acre
(1924-26) 14.56 bushels. (3) In 1927,
111,500,000 bushels.
(1) What are the principal factors to be
considered in establishing a iveekly news-
paper in a Vic. country town? (2) What
news services are available, and is it possible
for another paper in the town to have a
monopoly of all services? —6811.
(1) Principally, whether the district
selected is large enough and prosperous
enough to support your journal, from the
standpoint of circulation and advertising.
Whether there is or is not already another
journal in the field, you would be wise to
ascertain, by personal canvass, the amount of
support the venture is likely to receive.
(2) Either Country Press Co-op. Co., 390
Collins-street, or Provincial Daily Press,
349 Little Bourke-street. both Melbourne,
could arrange services. Vic. Provincial Press
Association, 380 Collins-street, could advise
as to whether a monopoly exists.
A suburban municipal council (Sydney )
■refuses to allow me to build d brick garage
with an iron roof, considering material and
design unsatisfactory. Can I make use of a
galv.-iron shed on wheels? —5657.
The District Court recently upheld an
appeal against a fine inflicted by a magistrate
upon a motorist who took this course, so
apparently you would be within your legal
right.
The N.S.W. Railways were for many years
a paying concern and large sums of money
were handed over to consolidated revenue.-
Has this money been credited to the capital
account of the railways, or are they still
paying interest on this amount? Would it be
possible to find out how much has been so
paid by the railways, and what amount it
would represent to-day tvith interest added?
—6805.
Up till June 30, 1925, profits were credited
and losses debited to the Consolidated
Revenue Fund. Accounts are _ now kept
separately. By examining the railway state-
ments back to the commencement of railway
undertakings in the State it might be pos-
sible, in conjunction with an examination
of the loan accounts in each year, to make
an assessment of the sort you suggest. The
Commissioners state that whatever profits
the railways made in past years have been
absorbed by losses in other years. For many
years prior to 1907 annual losses were
pretty regular. In 1890 the earnings were
onlv 3.17 P-c. of the capital outlay, in 1895
3 31 p.c.,Hn 1900 3.43 p.c., in 1905 3.40 p c.
The first substantial surplus was m 1910,
when interest earned was 4.58 p.c. and
interest paid 3.53 p.c. But the period of
deficits began, again in 1915.

HALF-HOURS WITH THE CENSOR.
Australia’s stipendiary vice-chaser was
indignant. “I don’t care if she was an Old
Woman,” he cried. “And this business
about living in a shoe is simply a blind, I
expect. The point is, who was the father
of all those children? As far as I can see
she was a nymphomaniac. The whole thing
reeks with suggestive possibilities. Out
with it! As for ‘Little Red Riding Hood,’ ”
he continued, “Sergeant Muldoon tells me
that it features a bedroom scene. Who do
these authors think they’re writing for, I
wonder? Immoral, filthy-minded degenerates
or what? Have the disgusting thing burnt
at once.”
“That finishes our list, sir,” said his off-
sider. “Australians have nothing left to read
now but ‘Hansard.’ ”
“And a good thing too,” muttered the
Censor as he grabbed his hat and made for
his favorite picture palace, where “Miss
Nudity of New York” was being shown.

NOTES RE THE PLAY.
(By our Special Representative with the

Note: Regardless of expense the “Daily Tosh” has
made arrangements for the publication of these
notes by a cricketing has-been and literary never-
waser. Prizes are offered, as announced elsewhere,
for the first reader to detect anything in these
notes that mightn’t have been reported by one who
had never left Australia. Further prizes are offered
to those who discover the greatest number of mis-

takes in spelling and grammar in our contributor’s
effusions. For particulars see page 13 and, if they
aren’t there, look somewhere else.
The innings of 397 n.o. made by Bradman
in the Loamshire match, which puts him
within hail of his 2000 notches, gives reason
for hope that this sparkling young smiter will
strike his true form before the end of the
present much-discussed tour, if not before
another dozen matches ha*ve been played, as,
indeed, should occur, always assuming Old Sol
resumes the mastery, and wickets
are in consequence suited to the
liking of Aussie’s Cootamundra
crack. The English papers are
already beginning to take notice of
the famous 21-year-old’s epic per-
formances ; in fact, his photograph
has been published in one or two
papers. Nevertheless, the cham-
pion should have been out when
his tally stood at 390. He made
a weak stroke which went up in
the direction of the outfield, and
would have been a certain chance
if there had been a fieldsman at
the position in question and the
ball had not gone over the fence.
This marred what might other-
wise have been regarded as a
chanceless knock.
If Bradman’s form shows a con-
tinuation of this improvement our
prospects in the Puddleshire match
look fairly good, always provided
his mates back him up and Grim-
mett, H’ornibrook and Fairfax
strike form with the ball. A
leading expert said to me
this morning: “If they can take
wickets they will get the Puddle-
shire men out.” A significant
admission in the circumstances.
The failure of Jackson to keep
going when he had only 91 runs
to get to reach his cen-
tury was a distinct disappoint-

Similarly if Bradman goes Off scoring
centuries m the Tests, lie may quite possibly
make runs. Further, if \\ alker continues
his good work behind the sticks he may yet
surprise us with' his virtuosity as a stumper,
And provided Richardson strikes form now it
will seem like it if he gets going in the
Tests. It may be a little confusing to some,
of course; nevertheless if this is good plaiD
English it will be understood if it is quite

He made a mystery of that —
He seemed the kind of schemer
Who kept things dark. Well, anyhow,
His moniker I don’no;
But be lie Moslem, Jew or Chow,
His Christian name teas Johnno.
I can’t describe him—tall and slim,
Or short and fat as butter;
There's but one fact impressed in him,
That’s this ’ere truth I utter:
Whatever race or creed was he
I cannot tell—l don’no;
One fact alone appealed ter me,
His Christian name was Johnno.

HOWTO
ENJOY
YOUR
WHISKY
Pour out a portion of ' W W HIT E
HORSE ” and add an equal portion of
water. Roll it round in your glass. First
test it by the nose, and its delightful and
pleasing aroma will at once be apparent
to you, an aroma which almost baffles
description. Then test your "WHITE
HORSE” by slowly sipping it. Roll it
round your tongue. Do not swallow at
first—allow your palate to detect and
appreciate its distinctive and delicious
flavour. No other whisky gives such a
deep sense of satisfaction and enjoyment.
HAVE YOU A
MEDICINE
CHEST?
Every home should
have a bottle of
“WHITE HORSE”
in its medicine chest.
Good whisky is in'
valuable in cases of flu,
sudden illness, severe
winter colds, etc. Be
prepared!

Poverty
Point
“Monodist”:, One of those Italian opera
stars left behind in Australia (B. 28/5/’80)
turned up in Christchurch recently, and
dropped the following note to the Mayor,
asking him to insert it in the “Sun,” It
appeared thus: —
I am a single Italian singer, all my life I sung
in Operatic Companies, but I don’t like Australia
because too hot too dry and too dusty, and the
population not give value to the good singing, there-
fore my business not go too well. My age she is
40, and 1 am not tall. I wish, to marry a lady
pianist with some money for help me, and if possibly
thin and fair. Don’t care which church she belong.
I heard about New Zealand, sure I like, and I will
try if I am. lucky if one I will find kindly you will
sec if she belong to a good family.
“Say Bo”: The very latest reasons for
divorce have been advanced at wonderful
Los Angeles, where Mrs. Viola Barton, a
circus fat lady who rejoices in the trade-
name of “Little Baby Viola,” proceeded for
a divorce against her husband on the ground
that he worried her so much that she was
losing her sole professional asset fast. At
latest advices her weight had declined from
36st. 81b. to 26st. 81b., and was still sinking.
“L. de R.” : As far as its legitimate enter-
prises arc concerned, the Firm put its head
in the oven and turned the gas on when it
placed an electrically-driven gramophone in
the orchestral well at Melbourne King’s for
the “Journey’s End” opening. The tiling-
refused to do anything but growl spas-
modically, and J.C.W. explained later that
the whole production had been rushed on
owing to the late arrival of the co. from
Adelaide, so a fault in the wiring had de-
veloped. It was a lame excuse considering
there are hundreds of unemployed musicians
walking the capital, with no faults in their
wiring but a very empty feeling in their
stomachs.
“G.D.S.”: Some of thdse amateur actresses
lead a strenuous life. One was recently
shot at Sydney Turret at 9.80, then rushed
across the harbor to the Community in order
to poison herself somewhere about 10.35
and all for art!
“Blum”: Strindberg’s playlet “Madame
X,” which has only two actors, one of whom
is silent, is outdone in the matter of stage
economy by the three-act drama “Courtesan,”
by I. K. Davis, which had a premiere in
New York last month. There is a cast of
one—the naughty lady of the title. A
murder off-stage and the suicide of the cast
at the end of the play are the highest lights
in the production. But think of the saving
in salaries !
“Lorette” (Penang) : The Salisbury Co.’s
excellent production of “Journey’s End” in
Singapore was distinguished by the appear-
ance of Noel Coward in the role of Stan-
hope. The brilliant actor-playwright-pro-
ducer happened to be touring the East with
his friend the Earl of Amherst. Coward
has taken beck with him to London one play
written during his tour.
.“Flaming Youth”: Cabled that Jacques
Cordon, who gets £2OO each time he plays
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,
dressed himself up as a beggar and played his
priceless Strad. on a street corner, but
gathered only £1 3s. 3d. It was an experiment
to test the public appreciation of music. A
Sydney man of all-round talent, who taught
French and music and was a concert singer,
did better than that financially. For a bet
he turned out in evening dress, wearing a
ma‘Sk, and sang in front of theatres and
hotels, then open until 11 p.m. The bet was
that he could not make £2O in a week ; he
gathered it in a few nights. It was unfor-
tunate for him, because he decided to make
“the Mystery Singer” a permanency, and in
a little time the silver ceased to come in.
There were, however, always free drinks at
the pubs, and eventually the end came at
Long Bay, where lie was taken on the
“vag.,” mainly because the police wanted to
give him a bath. He had become so unused
to baths that the waSh-np was fatal.
“Craiser” : The plays put on by William
Faversliam at Melbourne Comedy weren’t
as good as the music provided in the inter-
vals by that admirable organisation, the
Sisserman Trio. Not long ago the Firm
sacked an orchestra and replaced it with a
gramophone. When the new policy is ex-
tended to the other side of the footlights
a renaissance of the legitimate theatre may
be expected.
“McGuiness”: No more need The Bul-
letin refer to Sydney Town Hall as Bleak
House. Funds have just been made available
and more will be added to complete a scheme
for warming the big hall up in winter a<nd
cooling it down in summer. A special effort
is also being made to cater for a dancing
public. Cloakrooms and such-like conveni-
ences have been installed, the vestibule has
been converted into a foyer and assembly
room, and tables and chairs have been pro-
vided in the main hall, so that dances can
be arranged on the cabaret principle.
“Macann”: Doris Fitton, who has been
appearing at Sydney Turret, .is moving to
give Sydney a new repertory theatre, to be
known as the Independent. The aim is to
establish a repertory company of a limited
band of players, presenting a repertoire of
the best inodern comedies and lighter dramas.
Harry Tighe, playwright and novelist, will
look after the producing side.
“Cauboy”: Melbourne Repertory Society
can give points to legit, producers in the
matter of staging. Frank Clewlow makes
his own rough sketches and hands them to
E Kimpton, a painter of the Meldrum
school. The knowledge of tone (a dark
mystery to the orthodox scene-painter) and
of broad natural _ effects enables the latter
to build sets which succeed, even on the
small stage of the Playhouse, in conveying
the impression to an audience that they are
looking at the battlements of Troy or the
housetops of Jerusalem. The producers of
the regular theatre generally boast that
their scenery costs fabulous sums, insignifi-
cant as the result may be, The Rep.’s
setting for “Good Friday” cost £lO, and for
“The Ivory Door” £l5.
“Cine Ma” : The title wasn’t the only mis-
leading thing about “The Country Without
Women,” the recent German film purporting
to depict Australia. The producers put an
advt. in a Bucharest newspaper which ran :
Wanted, 413 young gills to go to Australia for
the purpose of getting married. Apply to the
English Migration Department, London.
Before the announcement stating that it was
only a publicity manoeuvre appeared the
next day, 53 girls had applied, one turning
up in London in person.
“Cauboy”: Danny Denny, whose eight-
feet odd of attenuated humanity has been
a perpetual source of amazement to the
juvenile patrons of Wirtlis, is the latest
Australian actor to seek fresh fields and
pastures new in Europe. The ship that
took him away from Melbourne had to pro-
vide him with a special bed in which to
stretch himself. Denny’s sole asset is bis
inches. As a comedian he is a melancholy
fellow, like most persons whose glandular
secretions have given them abnormal height
or abnormal lack of it. lie is a native of
Waugaratta (Vic.).
“L.H.P.”; Mrs. Glover, William C. Mac-
ready, Samuel I ’helps, Edward Sothcrn, the
Kendals and Sir llenry Irving are great
names in the history of the British stage.
They never acted in Australia, but some
of their descendants did, not always with
success. Young Glover, grandson of the
famous Mrs. Glover (nec Betterton),
appeared in Melbourne in the ’sixties in
Scotch drama, but like Macready’s son
Edward, to whom Barry Sullivan gave a*
show some years later, Glover lost his head,
or something, and became for a time a mere
hanger-on of Melbourne theatres. What
became of him and Macready is not
known. Samuel Phelps, the younger,
was introduced to Sydney in 1874 by
Billy Hoskins, playing the title role
to Billy’s Hawkeshaw in “The Ticket-
of-Leave Man.” He also played Captain
Absolute apd other juvenile leads in classic
comedies, but Sydney would have none of
him. Lytton Sothern, son of Edward, the
creator of Lord Dundreary, took his father’s
famous part in Sydney (1877). He
also played Surface, Garrick, etc., but pa’s
mantle had certainly not fallen on the son.
The Kendals sent a son billed as W. H.
Dorrington to appear with the Brougli-Bouci-
cault co., and a daughter, Dorothy Grimston,
to lead a J.C.W. dramatic co. H. B. Irving,
son of the Lyceum knight, toured Australia
in 1911 in some of pa’s famous roles.
The Inky Way
“Snifter ’ (London) : Fifteen minutes after
the arrival of the Australian cricketers Fleet-
street and its side alleys became menaces to
the pedestrian because of swarms of picture-
agency boys skidding around corners and
swooping headlong to the various art editors.
The first in with their prints get the fat of
the fee percentage, and some slick moving is
necessary. Last night Woodfull’s flock were
flashed” at Victoria at 7.40.‘ The mile to
I leet-street, the developing and printing and
the distribution were covered by 7.58.
“Steele Rudd”: Re par. (B. 28/5/’3O)
stating F. J. Millington, just passed out,
once took _ over ‘Steele Rudd’s Magazine’
and in no time slioved the circulation up to
15,000.” Truth is Millington (a good slow-
yarn writer and long-distance thinker) and
another started out to purchase the maga-
zine. But though an artesian well of cham-
pagne was turned loose on the deal at
Daniell’s Hotel, Brisbane, the purchase
money didn’t turn up, and after a few issues
the "inventor” took the reins again. I
found it hard going to work the magazine
up to its previous circulation (10,000 a
month) even though I enlisted the services
of Lai a Fisher, Frank Daly (just passed
oyer, too) and Con Drew, giving the last
his first pen job as sports writer.
Sydney-born Henry Kellett Chambers, who
for the past 40 years lias been toiling on
Ilearst publications in New York and San
F'ranciso, was on the .staff of each of the
four Sydney dailies of his time. He worked
for a while in Fleet-street, then slipped
across to U.S.A. Like his brother Haddon,
lie successfully turned his hand to playwrit-
ing, and wrote “Abigail,” “A Case of
Frenzied Finance,” a dramatic version of
“David Copperfield,” “The Butterfly”
(written for Lillian Russell), “An American
Widow,” “Betsy” and “The flight to Be
Happy.” He is also a good caricaturist.
At present he is on the “Literary Digest.”
“P.X.”: Sydney Full Court threw news-
papers a crust the other day. Verdicts for
less than 40 bob in libel cases in N. S. Wales
don’t carry costs unless the plaintiff can get
a* certificate that the libel, however frivolous,
was printed without reasonable ground or
excuse. In this present matter the plaintiff
asked for £lOO9, the defendant paid in Is.
and the jury gave him a farthing. The
Judge refused the order under which the
plaintiff might have recovered costs notwith-
standing that the verdict was for less than
405.; now the question was whether the
plaintiff could get even his fa*rthing. The
Chief Justice (speaking apparently for the
three, including the very learned Ferguson
and Halse Rogers) ended that controversy
with this observation, one of the most impor-
tant made in any Sydney libel suit for
years past: “The amount [of damages to
which the plaintiff was entitled] being less
than the amount paid into court, in full
satisfaction of its liability, it seemed to him
that the defendant succeeded at the trial.
Having succeeded at the trial, the defendant
was entitled to the general costs of the
action.” From which it seems that, where
something is paid into court in excess of the
amount awarded by the jury, the plaintiff
is liable to be plugged not only for his own
costs, but for part at any rate of the costs
of the defendant. The amount paid into
court, by the way, is paid without admitting
liability, and the payment is not disclosed
to the jury.

“J.C.” (London) : At the “Daily Mail”

“Disc Harrow”: Australian fruit has been
bringing low prices in London. Pears from
the Maloja were sold at Is. per case, repre-
senting a loss of about 10s. per case to
the shippers. In their own cool stores
growers can keep fruit perfectly for eight
months, and something’s wrong if it won’t
last five weeks to England. Anyone on the
Melbourne wharves can see cases of fruit
being dropped instead of carefully lowered,
and 14-stone men think nothing of tramping
over cases when stacking. Such treatment
would damage cocoanuts.
* * * *
“The Ghoul”: How’s this for Australian-
made? In 1920 at a Defence Department
sale of surplus stores I bought a navy-blue
woollen cardigan coat for 10s. I have
worn it every day since—not all the time,
of course, but for a couple of hours in the
morning and all Saturday afternoon —and
it looks good for a year or two yet. Another
I purchased for a friend served him for five
yea*rs, and then his wife cut it down for a
child, who still has it.

“V.H.R.”: With the purchase off the
Surrey Hills forest by Paper Makers, Ltd.,
from the V.D.L. Co., one of the biggest land
deals in the Speck’s history has been com-
pleted. The 123,000 acres of forest, with
approximately half a million acres of other
lands, was acquired by the V.D.L. Co. under
charter 105 years ago, and has been held by
the English shareholders ever since. It is
only 40 miles from Burnie, where the new
owners will establish pulp and paper mills.
The price paid for the forest and the factory
site (160 acres) was £150,000. A bounty of
£4 a ton on newsprint produced is expected
to be forthcoming from the Federal Govern-
ment. A good deal of the money laws already
been put up, but more is wanted.
* * * *
“Golarinna” : It is hard to understand why
footwear manufacturers should import goat-
skins (B. 30/4/’3O) when, in the far north
of S. Aus. and in Central Australia, goats
are almost the only stock left by the drought.
Could we realise ss. per skin most of us
could keep the mortgages at bay. .Tust now
Binghi covers his humpy with goatskins (in
preparation for the “big fellar rain”), and
they serve as rugs or packing on camel
saddles; but there is no market for them.
My last consignment of skins to Adelaide —
and a first-class lot they were—didn’t bring
enough to pay the railway freight. Were it
not for the meat and milk supply, William
and Mary would long ago have become ex-
tinct animals in Australia. What is the
defect in home-grown goatskins that sends
manufacturers abroad for their require-
ments?
* * * *
“Old Shaver”: In our business we don’t
have to study statistics to find out the
state of the country. Shaving’s the best
business barometer you can have. Things
boom and there’s many a man will want two
shaves a day who will make a once-over at
home do when depression hits us. In my
saloon there are two chairs. In February
things were at their worst; March wasn’t so
much better that the improvement was worth
mentioning; April showed an improvement
that you could notice, apd every week in
May has been better than the last. In
February and March we averaged 22 shaves
a week less than in February and March
last year, and 22 shaves, don’t forget, are
16s. For May we’ll be back, by the look of
things, to about 15 or 16 less than last
year’s. Which shows you.

“Bad Australian”: Although the old-
timer’s tale of the “good old days” is usually
taken with a grain of Salt, it would appear
from the following announcements, taken
from a Sydney daily of 60 years ago, that the
cost of living bore less heavily on the citizens
of that period than it does on the present
generation: “At Penman’s Golden. Fleece,
81 King-street. Bill of fare, this day:
Wallaby soup, meat, vegetables, pastry, salad,
cheese and a* glass of ale —one shilling.”
“American Restaurant, 192 Pitt-street.
Breakfast, lunch, supper, first style. Six-
pence. Furnished room for single gentle-
man, ss. per week.” “Bull’s Head, opposite
Central Police Office. Best French cognac,
2s. 6d.; superior Old Tom gin, 35.; whisky,
35.; Findlater’s stout, Bd.; Bass’s, Allsopp’s
and Tertnant’s ale, lid.; beer, 6d. per bottle.
* * * *
“Suds”: Until recently New Guinea box-
ing and sluicing methods have been very
crude. The lawyer vine riffles have lost as
much gold as they have held. It is a very
usual thing to get a couple of grains to
the dish of tailings in many of the old work-
| ings, and someone will yet make a fortune
out of the “mustard gold” which is distri-
buted for 40 miles down the Bulolo River.
This is a total loss now, and much “flaky”
gold dodges the process of recovery. Heavy
black magnetic sand helps to choke the
riffles and provide a surface for escaping
colors. At one stage of the mining here there
was not a single piece of matting or blanket,
in any of the boxes on the creeks, and
Ned Cokely’s famous 116 oz. nugget was
found in land that had been well worked
over.
* * * *
“Kokopo”: A fresh New Guinea venture is
coffee-planting, which is to be undertaken on
a large scale in the Mandated Territory by
a company headed by C. W'. Marr, a Minister
in the last Federal Government. Two thou-
sand acres have been acquired, and native
labor at Is. a day will do the work. The
Federal duty on foreign-grown coffee is £2B
a ton, so the co. should find a margin for
profit. Both Papua and North Queensland
started coffee-growing years ago. Disease
and the then Federal embargo on black-
grown produce set the Papuan industry back
badly. The Queenslanders, who had done
well under the State protection policy, were
blown out by the early Federal tariffs.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Offspring of Greenstead have Avon a power
of races this season. One of the smartest
of them is Greensea, who was a strong ianoy
for the June Stakes at Raiuhvick on Mon-
day. Threes was the quote while they were
at the barrier, but a longer price was laid
previously. Greensea soon had the lead, and
nothing could deprive him of it; he cut out
the six furlongs in the uncommonly good
time, of lmin. llsec. As at Warwick Farm
on May 30, Price’s pair, Casque d’Or and
Remora, were second and third; Casque d’Or
has been an unlucky nag.
The Bulletin’s idea that the A..T.C.
Hurdles would prove a match between
Grosvenor and Songift was borne out in the
actual race. Songift was in tne lead mr
the greater part of the journey, and he was out
by himself when Perides fell, Grosvenor
being well back. It wasn’t till they entered
upon the last half-mile that Carter began
to drive Grosvenor along; this he did to
such purpose that the big chestnut had
Songift’s measure before they reached the
last obstacle. Taking this in good style,
Grosvenor came away and credited A.J.C.
committeeman Pat Osborne with his second
success in the £2OOO race; Songift was
second and Paul T. third. Grosvenor’s
price 'closed at 9 to 2 after 5 to 1 and better
had been offered; Songift was at 5 to I
and Paul T. at 14 to 1.
The meeting will be continued on Satur-
day. Some fancies:—
Flying Handicap: Casque d’Or; next,
Fuji San.
A.J.C. Steeplechase: Grosvenor; next,
Songift.
Winter Stakes • Loquacious; next,
Bacchus.
Exeter Handicap: Aorangi; next, Poi-
tiers.

A succession of short-priced favorites,
notably Valess (5 to 4), Veneer (5 to 2),
Trevallion (6 to 4) and Shillingsworth (3
to 1), arrived at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.)
on Saturday; but, in spite of thrilling stories
to the effect that “Jack Brothuvaboy laid
£9OOO to £2OOO in one hand to Sydney’s
dashing lady punter,” and all that sort of
thing, doesn’t take unnecessary
risks on minor events at suburban meetings.
Only two or three horses are backed for
these unexciting sprints, and it is not in his
nature to be careless. He probably held mo re
on the Canterbury Cup than on any three
other races, and the Cup went to the rankest
of outsiders —Hustler, Avho led all the way
and romped home from the favorite, Vertoy,
and Inducement. Very few pencillers wrote
a bet against Hustler; his nominal price was
20 to 1, but the tote, paying three divi-
dends, returned £lO 2s. 6d. (19£ to 1) for
10s. Hustler is owned by Bob Bailie, Avho
had David and Don Moon in their great days,
and is leased by him to his son-in-law, E.
M. Williams; and so is The Quaker, who
took the Ashbury Handicap at tens.
Aorangi and King William Avere the favo-
rites for this race, but neither showed up,
though both should do better presently.

V.R.C. Grand National candidates are
diminishing fast. Cable hurdler) was killed
Avhile schooling, and his brother, Henare,
not being sufficiently long in work, had to
be scratched ; the pair were trained by Joe
Mulcahy. Bhopal (steeple) injured a stifle
through colliding with a gate post, but may
be all right again in a few days. Her stable
companion. Seegur Ghat, fell with Harris
in the Ilopetoun Steeplechase at Flemington
on Saturday, and had to be destroyed. Un-
less Bhopal recovers, Gus Powell will have
only Mosstrooper to depend on in the G. N.
Steeplechase, instead of a formidable trio.
Epical, who was strongly fancied for the
G. N. Hurdle, has experienced a recurrence
of last year’s leg trouble, and it is very im-
probable that he will reach the post.
His Ilopetoun Steeple success has brought
Nightlark into the limelight for the big
timber classic. lie Avas equal second-favorite
with Seegur Ghat, and in merely half a
point less demand than Sandhurst. Five
of the eight competitors failed to finish.
Nightlark outjumped Sandhurst, and beat
him for speed as avoll. The topweight tired,
and old Namera, coming home Avith his
familiar courage, credited Norman Turnbull
with second money. Nightlark has been
regarded as a non-stager, but on this occa-
sion he slioAved no sign of stopping, and
trainer R. Burbridge is confident that he will
see out the National distance. Like Sir
Alogy, winner of the Australian H'urdle and
Steeplechase of 1928, Nightlark was bred in
the neighborhood of Balranald (N.S.W.) ; D.
E. Murphy races him on the share system
with Burbridge.
Cobranveil was favorite for this season’s
Grand National Hurdle until he missed a
place in the race over the little sticks on
Saturday; howmver, that form may have to
be disregarded. Consequent on overnight rain,
the going proved heavy. This did not pre-
vent Cobranveil being well forward at the
second last flight, but he went right through
the obstacle, and that ended things so far as
the Lilyveil gelding was concerned. Horo-
scope (7 to 2), in generous galloping mood,
overhauled the pacemaker, India’s Hope, and
stalled off Tirade by nearly a length. The
most impressive effort was that of Moss-
trooper, who, making his first appearance
over jumps since August of last year, gained
third money. It is believed that he will
try to equal Redleap’s 1892 achievement in
annexing both Grand National Hurdle and
Steeplechase.
Scintillation, one of four prads that E.
M. Pearce had catalogued for sale by auction
in the following week, registered a brilliant
win in the juvenile race. She was as good a
favorite as Yaropian, who shaped far below
expectations and finished in the ruck. Near-
ing the judge’s box, Scintillation cleared out
from her rivals, and scored by four lengths
from Haraga. Scintillation is by Australian
Sun, sire of Glare.
At the Sydney autumn meetings, Park-
wood ran prominently in several races, but
failed to take a trick. On the strength of
track trials he was installed a 5-to-2 favorite
for the Royal Handicap, and made the
opposition look cheap. He is partly owned
by E. L. Baillieu, and another V.R.C. coni;
mitteoman, E. Manifold, handed the Royal
Handicap with Harbinger (6 to 1). Divi-
HIS ULTIMATUM.
DISGRUNTLED WING THREEQUARTER : “We get te ball orright, but te centre he feed te
orra wing all te time. He starve me next spell, and py korry I broomin’ well
fed up.”
sions of the Buckingham Welter went to El
Rey (5 to 1), a half-brother to Waranton,
and the almost invincible Alligator (3 to 1).
Jack Holt now trains El Roy for Mrs. L.
R. Buxton, who owns High Syce and High-
land.

Out of luck in Sydney for a couple of
mouths, McCarten, the Maoriland jockey, who
has settled in Australia, had a very profit-
able visit to Brisbane. On Cup day he
landed a double —on Rhonite, the Randwick-
trained son of Valais—Sibar, in the Sires’
Produce Stakes, and on Trainer in the Bris-
bane Cup. Rhonite, who is decidedly prom-
ising, but may require time, shared iavoiit-
ism,' at twos, with Monash Valley, another
son of Valais, who was left at the post
(he won the Claret Stakes, at evens, on the
last day) : but Trainer was at 7 to 1, Rube
Paddington and Lady Bine being in better
demand. He won by a length from Mintman,
who lost a lot more than that by dwelling
at the post; the Sydney colt Sir Kibble was
a poor third. Trainer, who is owned by
R. J. Spence, is a six-year-old gelding by
Chantemerle —Stable Girl, and is only a
plugger. He finished nearly last in the
Moreton Handicap, run on Saturday and
won in the last stride by an outsider, Dudley
Persse (20 to 1), from the favorite, Marella,
and Mintman.
* * * *
Some Quality added to the noteworthy
achievements of mares in rich handicaps
this season by capturing the A.R.C. Birth-
day Cup at Victoria Park, Adelaide, on
Saturday, after a desperate tussle with
Leahcim. That hardy veteran won a w.f.a.
race at the meeting, and so has distinctly
earned his oats since his return to the
turf; he won the Birthday Cup seven years
ago. He is by St. Anton (sire of Nadean)
out of Quoin ;.Some Quality is by Ethiopian
—Sessa. Her div. (for fl) was £4 25.;
his was £2 11s. Jones, the Melbourne jockey,
was on Some Quality; he also rode Doradus
and Amant, winners of the Goodwood and
City Handicaps respectively, so he has done
well in Adelaide this season.

“Thormanby”; This year’s Derby pro-
vided a skinner for Mcßagg, an 18-to-l
outsider in Blenheim getting home from
Iliad (25’s) and the solidly-backed winner
of the Two Thousand, Diolite, who went out
at 11 to 4. The winner is by Blandford,
sire of Trigo, the Irish nag 1 hat: won last
year, his dam running back to that great
sire Martagon. tie had a very decent record
as a two-year-old, but did nothing in the
early part of the season. He is owned by
the Agha Khan, which is something of a
record in itself. The Derby has been won
by all sorts of people, from royalty to
rooks, and by Frenchmen, Hungarians and
Yanks. The Agha is the first native of
India to collect the coveted race, and is
certainly the first saint to do so.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Yankee Benny Golden showed a strange
reversal of form in his scrap with Billy
Jones, of Newcastle, at Sydney Stadium. In
Golden’s first fight a few weeks ago he easily
defeated lightweight champion Norman Gii-
lespie. He shaped poorly against Jones
from the start to the 11th l and, when
Golden’s chief second announced that his
charge had had enough. A broken hand was
given as the cause of the stoppage, but the
Stadium doctor found no break, and the

football are to be revived.

iai ?£ ea , kaw£^”: Vor the first time since
IHld Sydney Grammar School’s XV has visited
Queensland. The first match in Banana-
land was against a representative XV from
the metropolitan schools, and the Sydney
lads won easily by 22 to 16. On the follow-
ing Saturday the tourists went down to
Queensland Secondary Schools by an uncon-
verted try. Toowoomba Grammar beat them
ci j loowoomba Grammar XV may visit
Sydney to play the Sydney schools. So far
iu its half-dozen matches, the
I.G.S. XV has not had its line crossed.
The Fifteen
In spite of rain interruptions, the Aus-
tralians scored a good win against Hamp-
shire, coming out ahead by an innings and
S runs. The tourists ran to 334 in their
cay knock, the inevitable Bradman con-
tributing a dashing 191. Even more cheering
was a lively 65 by McCabe. Jackson again
tailed to everyone’s disappointment, and
pcae of the others did much. Boyes, a slowish
lefthander, bowled finely for Hants, as his
figures (6 for 90) show. The county went
vr 1 • its ? econd Brown (47) and
llosie(24) again offering- the only serious
opposition to Grimmett (7 for 56) and
Hornibrook (3 for 51).
* * * *
Woodfull’s men scored the sixth win of
the tour when they defeated Middlesex at
Lords by 5 wickets. Australia’s first inn-
ings of 270 included a characteristic 102
from Kippax, while Bradman, McCabe and
bail-fax all ran into the thirties. The ex-
Australian Allen was the best of the
Middlesex trundlers, with 6 for 77. Middle-
sex could only catch 103 at the first try.
Hornibrook taking 7 for 42. They did
better at the second attempt, Ilendren help-
ing the total to 287 with a fine 1.38--the
first century scored against the tourists.
Australia had 121 to win, and got it with
a string of double figures, in which Jack-
son’s 26 was the highest. Hornibrook took
11 wickets for 102 in the match.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: A disquieting feature of the
Australian XI on the eve of the first Test
is the regular inability of the later batsmen
to make runs. Nearly all the big scoring
has been done so far by Bradman, Ponsford
and Woodfull, though Kippax’s centurv
Lords has come as a
wm-lr, . r , elief . for a century at Lords is
worth a couple on most other English
grounds However, McCabe is now getting
among the runs, and his troubles seem to
Dtmver. If only Jackson can get going the
outlook for the Test tourney is rosy. Hor-
mbrook and Grimmett have exceeded all
expectations with the ball, while Wall is
ale KS gster? W Start “ «“
* # * *
Tfent Bridge”: Britain’s batch for the
nist lest at Nottingham 'contains onlv one
newcomer to Test cricket, Robins, the'Cam-
bridge and Middlesex bowler. The rest are
ohl acquauitances, with Chapman as skipper.
Hobbs, Hendren, Sutcliffe, Hammond, Tate,
Larwood, Geary and Duckworth are the
others, with Woolley, Duleepsinhji and Ley-
land standing by for the eleventh place,
llie selection is something of a confession of
weakness, since outside Robins, who is only
a possibility at that, the bowling is not
impressive provided the wicket is good. Geary
is probably the most dangerous of the bunch.

• <<o l d /^ rafford ” Bradman’s feat of notch-
mg 1000 runs in Ma<y has never been
equalled by an Australian batsman, while
only four Englishmen have turned the trick.
Ihese were W. G. Grace, Walter Hammond,
lorn Hayward, and the Lancashire left-
hander C.. Hallows. The Bowral boy’s per-
formance is the more impressive since the
weather curtailed the number of innings he
played. Grace, who- was 47 when he put up
his performance in one of the driest summers
England had seen for years, averaged 112.88
tor the month. Bradman’s average when he
reached the four figures was 148.
Racquet and Brawl
‘‘Top Spin”: The results of the French
tennis championships, though disappointing
to Australians, showed our Davis Cup men
m a very good light. A most unfortunate
accident put Moon out of the running when
he was promising well in his singles semi-
final against the Italian De Morpurgo, and
it was left for Cochet to collect the title
from the veteran Tilden in the final, the
local man winning by three sets to one.
1 rench barracking upset the ageing William,
who at one period of the game announced
his intention of throwing in his racquet.
Better counsels prevailed, and the tempera-
mental one carried on to take his medicine
like a little man.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Matrimony evidently
h?sn t staled the infinite variety' of Helen
Wills, for under her new name of Mrs. Wills-
Moody she collected the French women’s
singles championship last week for the third
year in succession. Her opponent in the
final was another America®, Helen Jacobs,
none of the English girleens getting near the
finals, though Fraulein Aussem was well up.
I erliaps Mrs. Helen’s example will have its
effect on our own Daphne Akhurst, who has
also turned to the life matrimonial, and is
said to be considering the abandonment of
tennis.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: England’s flapperdom
squealed with indignation as one female when
it was announced that Betty Nuthall had
been left out of the English Wightman Cup
team to meet the America® young persons.
Betty has had a wonderful press for some
years, but Mr tennis capacity has never
quite equalled her gift for publicity chasing,
and she may now be ranking with the also-
ra®s. Another pet of the flapper press,
Eileen Bennett, was also left on the outer,
but since she has changed her na*me to
Mrs. Furnley-Whittingstall one ceases to
wonder. There’s no room for a name like
that on an ordinary tennis court.
The Nineteenth Hole
. Hoylake” : Bobby Jones having now won
the British amateur championship must find
hi ms oil at a loose end. Though he has won
the British open event twice, the amateur
blue ribbon had always eluded him. The
American is a marvel of consistency, and his
success is probably due to the fact that he
plays _ very little golf outside the big stuff.
American players have not had too good
a spin m this event, though W. J. Travis
won it as long ago as 1904—and he was an
Australian, by birth at least.
* * * :|s
Sandringham”: Australian golfers have
noted with interest that the Hon. Michael
Scott lasted well to. the end of the British
amateur golf championship, downing, among
others, that formidable Yank Yon Elm.
Mick must be pretty long in the tooth by
now, tor he was no chicken in his Royal
when he won the Australian
open in 1904. He repeated the trick three
years later, and also annexed the Australian
amateur title than four times. •
.“Divot Digger”: The N.S.W. golf cham-
pionships have drawn big entries for all
events, but interest will naturally centre in
wTil ing es \ which s t ar t on June 14. Ivo
Whitton, who has a careless habit of winning
State championships and then forgetting to
turn up and defend them on the next occa-
sion is going to do his best to hang on to
his last year’s blue ribbon this time. He is
up against that very solid player R. H.
Bettington in the first round, which will be
played at Kensington.
* * * *
“Gregory Terrace”: With Brisbane City
Council now committed to the construction of
a municipal golf course in Victoria Park, ail
ardent golfers in the Bananaland capital who
cannot afford to join up with the clubs will
heave, a sigh of relief. The terrain is a very
sporting one from a golfer’s point of view,
though the soil, mostly schistose rock thinly
covered with grass, is likely to give trouble
to anyone desiring to take a divot. The
only folk likely to regret the intrusion of
are the- lovers and the cows that
used to frequent the area in my time, and
possibly still do so. The lovers won’t care
no one plays golf at night—and I doubt if
the cows will either, it being difficult to
upset Strawberry’s equanimity.
* * * *
“Cranoustie’’: That blessed phrase “ama-
teur status” is engaging the attention of
N.S.W. golfers. A club member was
objected to on the ground of profes-
sionalism. His iniquity lay in the fact
that he had worked as a caddie after
reaching the age of 16 years. St.
Andrews altered their rules some time
ago to permit lads to act as paid caddies up
to 18 years. N.S.W. golfing authorities have
not adopted the new rule. What is good
enough for the barnacled old boys of historic
W-* Andrews should be good enough for the
A.SAY. golfing heads—probably the most
Hidebound mob of their kind in Australasia.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz’: Kaye Don was no sooner back
from his run of bad luck on Daytona Beach
than the most cherished of his records was
reft from him. This was his spin of 134.23
m.p.h. on Brooklands track, which was only
designed to carry speeds up. to 120 mp h
with safety. 11. R. S. Birkett, described as
the millionaire driver,” was responsible. He
clocked 104.60 for the first lap, and then
wound off three others at an average of
135.33 m.p.h. in a 4J-litre supercharged Bent-
ley.
* * * *
“Differential”: "When Australians Norman
Smith and Don Harkness established a
world’s record for a 10-miles motor spin on
the Ninety-mile Beach at Kataia, in Maori-
land, some months ago, in a car built by Ilark-
ness round a Rolls-Royce aeroplane engine,
the pair turned their thoughts to still higher
achievement. Through the good offices of the
Federal Government the British War Office
lias, consented to lend one of the secret 'plane
engines designed to win the Schneider Cup,
and Harkness will fit it into a chassis. Little
is known of the engine save that it develops
1700 b.-h.p. at 4000 revs, per minute, but
Smith reckons he will get 300 xn.p.h. out
of it on the M.L. beach.
* Hf * *
“Poppet”: The Yanks are merely copying
Yurrup in the production of immensely high-
powered cars for the use of wealthy and
menta*lly-deficient road-hogs. The Miller
Eight, mentioned by “Hoppit” (B. 21/5/’3O),
possibly can do 150 m.p.h. on the open road
if the. road is made of concrete and the
wind is behind it, but I wouldn’t like to
back it against some of the monsters that
the Isotta-Fraschini and Hispano-Suiza
people have been turning out these 20 year’s
past. An “1.F.” two-seater roadster built
before the war for a wealthy Italian “sports-
man” had a racing of 250 h.p., and the His-
pano firm emitted at least one monstrosity of
considerably bigger capacity. In a really
civilised world it would be a criminal offence
to let such freaks loose on a road frequented
by ordinary traffic.
Miscellaneous
“Shell”: The world’s professional sculling
championship changed hands last week when
Ted Phelps beat Albert Barry on the Thames.
Phelps had an astonishingly easy win, lead-
ing all the way over the long Putncy-Mort-
iake trip of 4| miles, which he covered in
22min. 45sec.—very good time for that tricky
course. Phelps, like the defeated Barry,
comes of a long line of Thames watermen.
He was Bob Pearce’s pacemaker when the
latter was training for the sculling event
at the Amsterdam Olympiad, and no doubt
picked up a few wrinkles from that incom-
parable sculler.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Maoriland is sending a
strong team to the Empire Games in Canada
besides the rowing eight. Lay will tackle
the. javelin throw, while Elliott will be the
sprinter, Savidon the distance runner, and
Johnson the hop, step and jump representa-
tive. A solitary damsel, G. E. Pidgeon, will
figure among the swimmers, the others being
Bridson and Calder.
* * * *
“Ride Off” : The Ashton brothers continue
to play good polo in England. At Hurl-
lngham, they beat the Hurricane Club
13-8, the home side, rated the. strongest in
England, being asked to give the Goulburn
men a 6-goals allowance. Playing at Rane-
lagli a couple of days later the Australians
beat another strong side in the Knaves, 12-4.
On English rating, the losers should have
given the N.'S.W. men a 3-goals allowance,
but since the event was an open one, the
Roeha*mpton Cup, both teams started level,
lhe quality of the Australian ponies has
been the subject of astonished comment
among English players and the strong Ameri-
can contingent, which comes to Britain for
the polo season every summer.
* * * *
“Jigger”: If Walter Lindrum made little
or nothing out of his record-breaking Eng-
lish trip (B. 21/5/’3O), his personal expenses
must have been on a par with some of his
breaks. Walter’s tale of woe, unfolded in
a Sunday paper on the eve of his leaving
England, provoked a reminder from Bur-
roughes and. Watts that they had paid him
12193 as his share of gate receipts from
matches played undor his contract with
them,, and an extra £350 for setting up a
world’s record and incidentals. That sum
by no means exhausted the tally of his
takings; and as for the presents he brought
back !

“Both in work done and low cost of
doing it, my Chevrolet Six Tipper
has been wonderful, and my class of
work is particularly hard on the
truck . My truck has done 10,563
miles and is still on the original tyres.
My repair bill is 16/-. The truck is
very light on oil and I get 20 miles
per gallon of petrol.
“I might mention that a friend of mine
who runs a fleet of Trucks was so
impressed by the work my truck does
that he is changing to Chevrolet,”
writes Mr. James Carmichael,
Municipal Road Contractor,
of Wonthaggi, Victoria.
Typical of Australian-wide enthusiasm is
Mr. Carmichael’s comment. Typical also
is his friend’s change to Chevrolet. For,,
in these days, when conditions necessitate
economy, haulage users are swinging to
Chevrolet in ever-increasing numbers.
Low first cost —low running cost —low
maintenance cost —ability to work hard,
long, and dependably —these Chevrolet
qualities help you to handle more jobs
in less time at lower hauling expense.
With a Chevrolet Truck you gain greater
goodwill, through better delivery. Greater
profits follow. The small business grows.
The big business becomes bigger.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Have you
ordered
Kraft Cheese?
Probably the 5000 —or was it 50,000? —
men, women and children Avho were out at
Mascot at 7.30 the other morning to be in
time for Amy Johnson’s arrival at 2.30 had
forebears who sat for a week ahead on their
campstools before the gates of the Roman
Circus when Nero was offering a star attrac-
tion. Such enthusiasm could not be the out-
come of a single generation of show addicts.
That Mascot was mud to the ankles, that
the sky was a sulky blue-grey, meant nothing
to the watchers. While Amy was picnicking
with Charley Ulm and his Avife in the
National Airways’ Southern Sun, Mascotians
refreshed themselves with a sardine sand-
wich and a thermos. But there must have
been a good deal of nourishment in the sar-
dine—or it may have been the thermos —
judging by the hurricane of yells that swept
the air when the Southern Sun and its
escorting flotilla of 20-odd planes, six of
them piloted by Avomen, skimmed along the
sky-line. Jason’s Quest, Amy’s own ’bus,
in the capable hands of Captain Brain, was
received with almost as wild applause as
the girl flier when, standing erect on a motor
lorry, every tooth flashing, arm upraised in
greeting, brown-haired, her cheeks pink from
excitement and windburn, she rode around
the barriers, so that the cheering crowd
might gaze its fill. Then came the trial by
dais, with speeches springing on her, like
unleashed wolves, from every direction. The
Attorney-General, the Chief Civic Commis-
sioner, Mr. Mutch (for the people of
Botany), the Mayor of Mascot, Captain
Hughes, Maoriland—all had their say. Then
came more cameras, polite chit-chat to ladies
on the blue-card dais (the seidlitz habit still
persists: a white-card holder was in a
farther-off reserve) , a procession to the Town
Hall, press interviews, and finally the calm
of Government House.
Even' if work or inclination kept you in
the city, you got a thrill out of the landing,
for the ’planes flew' low over Sydney: and
the startled pigeons in Martin-place added a
cloud of grey to the grey atmosphere.
There w T ere misunderstandings and a little
confusion over Amy’s reception and enter-
tainment, but that w'as inevitable, because
no tAvo people view'ed the girl’s performance
from quite the same point. Most of these
flights had been stunts financed by news-
papers which arranged all things to suit their
own ends. This wasn’t one of that sort,
but nobody knew exactly what sort it was.
So a score of little groups struggled to
adopt Amy as their own. The newspapers
Avanted her paraded before as many people as
possible in the interests of publicity and
circulation; the Empire builders pushed
her forward as one who had done all this
to bind us closer together : women societies
claimed her as an aerial Joan of Arc sent
to show that woman was man’s equal in
everything, and commercial interests crowded
round to discover hoAV it could all be used to
their advantage.
After studying her this Letter comes to the
conclusion that nothing she might sa*y just
now would throw much light on the real
Amy Johnson. She is in a state of mental
confusion, in which exaltation is most pro-
nounced at present: by and bye, if she is
not careful, it is likely to be followed by
equal depression. She had only the vaguest
notion of wdiat she was facing; she had
become infatuated with flying, and, having
resolved (like so many of us) to do some-
thing tremendous, she Avas almost trapped
into this Anglo-Australian flight. The strain
of it was very great, and there is no doubt
she Avas on the verge of breakdown when she
reached Darwin. , Which explains several
things that happened afterwards;
Sir John GoodAA'iu, the medical Governor
of Queensland, intervened in Brisbane, and,
besides driving her to bed, forbade her to
fly to Sydney in the Jason. He AA’as so
concerned about her condition that he wrote
to Sir Philip Game asking that he Avould
receive her as his guest in order that she
might have the quiet which Sir John
believed Government House alone could
secure for her. In Sydney, Dr. Black-
burn immedia*tely ordered her to cut out
all engagements for the next 24 hours at
least—an order Avliich (characteristically of
patients in this condition) was disobeyed.
What is ahead of her nobody knows. But
doctors who have Avatched her believe
that, unless she is kept Avell in hand, she will
at any rate do no more solo flying. Fortu-
nately she is physically very strong, and that
alone has enabled her to carry on thus far.
Ernest Truman thundered out “The Con-
quering Hero,” “Johnnie Comes Marching
Home” and such like, and into a Town Hall
filled with long trestle tables surrounded by
women and spread with cold meats walked
Amy Johnson. Twittering around her were
the ladies of the committee which had
arranged this Women-Citizens’ luncheon.
They were inclined to be anxious and coddle-
some—rather like a drove of finches pro-
tecting an eaglet. The public they seemed
to fear as one might a cat that, unwatched,
would spring upon the winged one. How-
ever, nothing beyond salvos of applause
occurred to break the air-girl’s peace of mind.
At a table on a dais in front of the stage
she sat between Mrs. Bavin and Mrs. John
Garlick —not nearly so vivacious a figure as
she had been at the civic reception earlier,
when the Admiral had borne her company.
She wore the black musquash coat with
the squirrel collar and cuffs which the Arts
Club had contributed to her wardrobe per
medium of Mrs. Florence Taylor; and, as
earlier in the day, she wore no hat to hide
tlie light-brown hair with its heavy waves of.
which she seems justly proud. There were
roses in high standard vases before her.
Red and pink gold, they were laid in two
flat chains the length of the table; at her
back the three crowns of Hull in blue and
gold rioted on a shield; the outline of
Australia in wattle and gold was at the
base of the dais, and aeroplanes as thick
as a cloud of locusts had settled on name-
cards and cakes.
Tickets for the luncheon cost 55., and at
2s. the galleries were filled with people who
gazed on rows of women doctors, lawyers,
w T riters and intellectuals struggling with the
carcase of the turkey that surely led the
flight of the Jew across the desert into the
Promised Land. Before the contest with the
bird started Florence Austral swept on to
the platform and poured out great round
hallelujahs till the roof nearly lifted.
Applause threatening to hold up the traffic,
somebody came out and announced that Miss
Austral would give an encoi’e if the lunchers
would kindly refrain from clattering their
knives and forks. They refrained, and Aus-
tral retaliated with Brunhilde’s “Battle
Cry.” Then she brought her smart beige
outfit with its high hare collar to a seat
amid the Mighty. After that, if you w T ere
an eater, you ate; if a lookeivon, you looked,
quietly and peacefully. Then came the
speeches, led by Chief Justice Street’s lady,
who was followed at some length by Dr.
Lucy Gullett, who threw a posy in passing
at Mr. Hinkler, whom she described in her
deep contralto notes as “the greatest of
them all.” Then at the hands of Mrs. Bavin
and Dr. Constance D’Arcy the English girl'
gathered in another couple of brooches.
After which she got ready to depart.
Then up sprang Mrs. Garlick. “Don’t
touch her!” she commanded. “Don’t
touch her!” The Town Hall officer, who is
usually one big cheery smile, hypnotised by
the tone, stepped ahead of the procession
down the hall, his arms filled with presenta-
tion vegetation topped by a Teddy bear, and
“Don’t touch her!” he chanted solemnly—
“ Don’t touch her!”
The air-girl turned up at the Flying
Corps Ball in a beautiful velvet -wrap. It
■was of apple-blossom pink, made with a
storm collar of white fur; its sleeves had
a graceful cape effect, and it was cut with
a long peplum back. Under it a frock of
floral georgettes swayed and dipped, and a
moment after she arrived in the vestibule
of the Wentworth her hands were brimming
with presentation red roses. The committee
was so glad to see her even at the tenth
hour that it nearly ate her up. Sim had
been too fatigued to come to the dinner
arranged by the Sliell Oil people at the same
hotel, and the atmosphere of uncertainty
persisted in spite of a barrage of com-
muniques from Government House, where
Amy is a bed-and-breakfast boarder.
Interest was kept up by the circulation of
the brooch the A.F.C. was presenting to
the Yorkshire lass, the badge done in gold,
diamonds and pearls. The Julius lady and
Cyril Westcott piloted the air-maid to the
ball, and president George Hartman and
his wife, she in blue satins of Grecian cut.
did the welcoming.
The A.F.C. is nine years old, and already
is of such a strength that the ballroom was
crowded by its members and their friends.
Of the general public there Avas scarcely a
sign. Famous air names were heard on every
side. Here were Flight-Lieut. and Mrs. Les
Holden, she in dark green lace cut with a
shoulder cape; the C. T. Ulms ; Boris Kings-
ford-Smith, a cousin of the airman, in
powder-blue georgette; Dr. Geordie Hamil-
ton and his wife; Squadron-leader Garnet
Malley’s wife, in silver grey; and Mrs.
Cobby, who came with her sky-pilot, in blue
lace. * About half-past ten Sir Philip and
Lady Game dropped in on their way home
from the Big Brother rally in the Town
Hall, bringing A.-D.-C. Gifford, Miss
Crowdy and young Philip Game. Oscar
Blackburn was secretary of the flutter, and
had a landing area of carpet bounded with
cushiony lounges and chairs for Miss John-
son and the Vice-res. But for the press-
women, who had to stand around all night,
not even a wooden perch was provided.
Gifts poured upon Amy in such a flood,
and the young woman was so patently ready
to receive them, that before the end of the
week somebody had made up his mind that
a business was being made of it. So the
order went out that Government House was
not to be used for “business,” and a great
pilgrimage of tradespeople bearing gifts
to lay at the feet of the new goddess was
hastily cancelled. Really some sympathy is
due to the Games. No doubt, as a distin-
guished airman, Sir Philip was glad to wel-
come Miss Johnson ; but to have this invasion
before the family had time to turn round in
its new home was a little more than even a
Governor and his wife should be asked to bear.
Dear Mollie Poynter is dead; and every
land that she has known in her wanderings
is the poorer that she will walk its ways
no more. Of all people this writer has known
this lady had been endowed in the greatest
degree with the gift for friendship. That
is a rare gift; it means that the owner is
constantly giving out sympathy and spend-
ing herself in love and generosity for others.
She had lived with her husband, Sir Hugh
Poynter (Australian head of Baldwin’s),
only three years in Sydney, yet probably
no woman who has lived here all her life will
be more widely mourned. She was a bril-
liant talker, she knew life and lands not
only with the knowledge of the traveller,
but with the soul of a poet. As a tiny girl
she once walked hand in hand with Oliver
Wendell Holmes, and all her life the great in
literature and art have been her companions.
The Burne-Jones and Kipling connections,
through her husband, were her greatest
pride. She wrote charmingly. “Along the
Winding Road” and “With the Seasons” are
two books of exquisite poems. Her “When
Turkey was Turkey” is as intensely interest-
ing as one knowing the author would expect.
Her father, Charles Dickinson, had been
Consul-General in Turkey for 16 years. It was
in Constantinople she and Sir Hugh met
and married —he was then Assistant-Comp-
troller of Technical Services. Since the war
the two have been in Canada, France and
America, and it was only a few months ago
they felt settled enough to send for their
household treasures and arrange them about
their Turramurra home. Lady Poynter’s
brother was with her at the end. He arrived
at Sydney about three weeks ago.
Troop-Sergeant Boyer, a little bit gnarled
with the years but still sound all through,
stood very erect in his uniform of the Legion
of Frontiersmen when his turn came at the
King’s levee last week. On the dais with
the Governor were Lieut.-Governor Cullen,
Rear-Admiral Evans, Brig.-General Heritage
and Squadron-Leader Cobby. With Troop-
. Sergeant Boyer stood Chief Pet-ty-officer E.
T. Crane, V. H. Branwhite and T. N. Cres-
wiek, who fought in the Soudan in 1885, and
IV. J. Rawlinson, whose decoration was the
Zulu War ribbon of 1879. Troop-Sergeant.
Boyer spoke: “I bring you greetings, yo'ur
Excellency, from the Veterans and the Fron-
tiersmen of New South Wales, with wishes
that your stay with us will be a happy one
and non-contentious. Should it prove other-
wise, God Save the King!” And after that
how drab the robes of Judges, the scarlet hoods
of learning! We were all King’s Men here.
Enough gold and green to tie up the entire
Trish Free State was flaunted at the Big
Brother Ball. The Town Hall lights dripped
streamers of the inspiring colors. Gold and
green in plaques blazed around the galleries.
Palms tied up with gold had a rakish look.
But there was nothing rakish about the
ladies of the committee. They were decorum
itself in white kid gloves that reached to
the shoulders when they assembled to greet
the Governor and his lady. And then Lady
Game and Miss Crowdy walked in without
as much as a glove button between them.
So much for these glove edicts from over-
seas ! This was the fourth Big Brother
Ball, and, being a special effort, the found-
ers of the movement, Richard Linton from
Victoria and his sweet-looking wife, had
made the journey to Sydney to add further
lustre to the party.
The State Exes, arrived about half-past
nine, Lady Game’s black moires and Miss
Crowdy’s emerald greens presenting a fine
contrast. There were four consular tables,
eight debs., and a pageant of Australia’s in-
dustries. Each set laid an offering of fruit
and flowers at the feet of Lady Game, and,
as the Herrings were also present—not. to
mention the Garlicks —there was nothing
wanting to make a meal. Mrs. Berge had
written the lines introducing the sets, was
matron of the debs, (one of whom was Laura
Chaffey, a fair-haired daughter of the Chief
Secretary) and had also composed a song
for Amy Johnson which was sung, although
that lass did not materialise. Mrs. Bavin’s
black georgettes, Mrs. Ferrari Passmore’s
amber glittering with gold beads, the black
laces of Mrs. W. G. Layton, ex-chief Justice
Cullen, and the Lintons sat about a table
whoso chief decoration was an enormous aero-
plane of red roses and a flower doll, both
intended for the missing A.J. One of the
jolliest parties was under the direction of
the Tom Kavanaghs. Near by sat Miss
Charles-Fairfax and her guests. Knight
Henry Braddon brought a party; so did Mrs.
George Taylor, the Luscombe-Newmans, and
many other well-known people.
After the business of their reception, new
Governor Philip Game and his lady made
their first public appearance at the All Aus-
tralia Ball. Brig.-General Bertie Lloyd organ-
ised it as a preliminary to his £lO,OOO drive
in aid of the offshoot of St. Margaret’s which
is to be known as the N. S. Wales Hospital
for Women and Children. The Wentworth
was the gayest spot in town that night, for
large sections of the community turned up
in their gladdest raiment to greet the State
Vice-res. They were a bit tardy off the
mark, and at nine o’clock the ballroom was
still a spirited scene of sugar-icing debs
blown across the floor like a snowstorm by
the blast of a megaphone which told them
where to assemble; of General l“loyd, im-
pressive and embonpointish, button-holing
George Fitz Patrick, thin as a candle-flame
after his illness, but waxing stronger; ol
a lovely little bud in petal-pink, clutching
a posy of golden wattle; of Muriel Herbert
in black georgettes speeding from one point
to another, her pink posy streaming like an
immature feather-duster ; of a. handful of
couples in the last lap of a competition foxtrot.
Suddenly came a hush, and committee
ladies hurried to the front of the house.
Then two lines of military males, one in Air
Force blue, the other in mess-kit, stood to
attention. The band played “God Save,’’ and
up the human aisle walked Sir Philip; his
lady in a slim gold dress and shoes; Miss
Crowdy, in a nice smile, flowing black and
four decorations ; A.-D.-C. Gifford, who looks
like a jolly Maoriland schoolboy; and young
Philip Game, who with his fine flushed
cheeks this Letter is tempted to call Daisy.
The whole ballroom stood at gaze. General
Lloyd called for three cheers. His Ex. said
“Thank you,” and then the debs, were
brought on. A niccr-looking line of girls,
each with an escort in uniform, has surely
never been presented. One answered to the
name of Frederica Broomfield. She was a
souffle of tulle and she was blonde. Other-
wise she was a replica of mother, Mrs. Reg
Broomfield. Railway Commissioner Cleary
and Mrs. Cleary were among the dancers,
she in eggshell-blue moire ; and on the dais
were Premier Bavin and his wife, and Admi-
ral Evans and Mrs. Evans, she in rose-pink
chiffons with floppy side pieces. Ann Lane,
one of the secretaries of the success, added
flowered pink taffetas to the color scheme.
The memorial fountain given to the City
of Sydney by J. F. Archibald, the founder of
The Bulletin, which lias been on show in
the Salon of French Artists in Paris, will
soon rear its grandeur in Hyde Park. It will
stand in that beautiful area of Sydney that
has St. Mary’s for a background, while
across the park tower the buildings of Eliza-
betli-street, and to one side in King-street
St. James’s raises a bronze finger .to the sky.
The fountain, which is the work of the
French sculptor Siccard, has a base 65 feet
in diameter. Here Apollo towers above Pan,
Diana, Theseus and the Minotaur. At
Apollo’s feet is the Rising Sun; cascades
gush from the nostrils of the chariot horses,
overbrimming a series of small basins, finally
flashing into the great basin surrounding
the group of statuary. Still lower than the
figures, dolphins fling up jets of water to
lave the feet of the immortals. The whole
is to be a blaze of electrics, and at night
each jet will be multiplied in the rippling
waters of the basin.
One of the happiest parties of the week
was tucked away in the Arts Club. There
were no wings about it, except wings of song,
and Florence Austral and John Amadio
were the guests. Wattle was the principal
decoration, and shone mistily gold through
the twilight of the big room. The Queen
Victorians wore the hostesses, and in her
green and pale gold tiny Mrs. Arthur Seriv
'ener, their president, looked like a butterfly
blown up against the black velvet outfit of
the heroically buit Austral.
Canon Cakebread’s daughter Joy was mar-
ried last week. Father tied the knot that
bound her to R. John McNiven, of Coog>-e,
in his own church of St. Jude’s in Rand wick.
Chiffon velvet, mellow as old ivory and
girdled with diamente, a 'Limerick lace
veil rich with years, and an armlet of
orchids and cream roses created the proper
atmosphere, while two ’maids in apple-green
-tulle and a flower girl in rosy taffetas made
up the procession. The canon and Mrs.
Cakebread later on exchanged good cheer for
good wishes in St. Jude’s Hall.
In regard to an official objection to Gov-
ernment House being used as a parcels
office for Sydney shopkeepers’ presents to
Amy Johnson, one paper snorted indig-
nantly: “The Duke and Duchess of York'
received gifts while staying there, and so
did the Prince of Wales.” Evidently it’s
all one to be Queen of the Air or Heir of
the King.
OVERHEARD.
Wive: “And Amy, on her way to Sydney, lunched
in the air.”
Bored Husband: “On a hunch of dates, no doubt.”

O NATIONS as to individuals comes in life a dark hour when
depressing troubles must be faced.
To Australia the dark hour has come. Financial trouble has
depressed the spirit of the nation —has cramped the spending power
of all.
But —sound at heart, brave in the face of adversity, Australia
knows that u the darkest hour is just before the dawn.”
For Australia there is promise of a tomorrow when, stronger
than ever, she will be able to look back on this dark hour as a
blessing.
How far away that much desired tomorrow may be depends
on the individuals who go to form the nation.
If each of us realises that prejudiced, unthinking methods of
buying and selling are the soil in which depression flourishes; if each
of us develops a new belief and a greater pride in the resources with
which our country is so rich, then the tomorrow for which we all
hope will dispel the gloom of our dark hour NOW.
If we do NOT realise these things, our tomorrow may
NEVER come.
Let us face the facts. Our country produces most of the things
we need for our very existence and for our generous pleasure.
Our products are equal to the world’s best.
Let us follow the splendid lead given by our Federal Government
in their effort to consolidate Australian Industry—to keep the Nation’s
wealth in Australia.
Let us buy Australian products freely. Let us remember that
hundreds of thousands of our fellow countrymen exist on our support
of the industries which employ them.
Let us realise that these industries, as they prosper by our support,
will be able to provide more employment, better conditions, and make
certain their permanency.
As with so many other re~
quirements of life, so with
whisky.
Australia produces the
world’s purest whisky —
“OLD COURT .” Its quality
has won for it the largest sale
of any single brand of
bottled whisky selling in
Australia. But thousands
upon thousands of Aus-
tralians have still to be con-
vinced of its superiority.
When they do become con-
vinced, the industry which
produces this fine spirit will
be able to enhance its use-
fulness to the nation by ever-
increasing employment and
even more substantial sub-
scription to the nation’s
wealth.

Governor Somers’s annual handshaking
at Parliament House in honor of George
Five’s natal day is an exclusively male affair,
like a funeral, though the skirted sex is
beginning to ask why. Still, the ordeal is
a heavy one and takes the form of an obstacle
race under and over the furniture of the
Legislative Assembly room, along sundry
draughty corridors, up stairs and down,
until the long snake of uniforms and elderly
gents, in spats and frock-coats that have
seen better days pokes its head into the
Queen’s Hall. In the queue last week was
the veteran little Samuel Mauger, a former
Minister of the Crown, whose hatter’s shop
was once the rendezvous for Deakin and
other great statesmen of his day. To show
the aides around the awkward pitfall of his
name the Hon. Samuel has “pronounced
Major” in large red type inscribed on his card.
What with the brisk, boyish-looking Somers
in his skin-tight naval breeks, his retinue
like a* series of fashion-plates of famous
British regiments, and the cohort of scarlet-
robed legal lights, ecclesiastical dignitaries
and naval and military guns, nobody would
have been surprised if the crowd on the
dais had broken into a chorus from “The
Vagabond King.”
Melbourne ought to make up its mind on
which day it will celebrate the birthday of
George V. A statute, • which is supposed to
have more force than a Dominion Office
request or old custom, fixes the following
Monday for the observance, if the birthday
anniversary does not fall on a Monday. This
year flags were flown, powder was exploded
in the Domain, and a levee was held on
June 3, and then there was a public holiday
on Monday, June 9. There are many people
who would be quite satisfied With the flags,
guns and levee without the holiday, and cer-
tainly his Gracious would have no objection.
The burst-up which is to deprive many
people from seeing Amy Johnson arrive in
Melbourne' happened this way. Sundry
churchmen, headed by Dean Aicken, called
on the reception committee with a stereo-
typed protest against the flying damsel being
allowed to desecrate the Sabbath. Lud
Mayor Luxton, with unexpected Machiavel-
lianism, countered the thrust with a sug-
gestion that the occasion should be turned
into a religious ceremonial. The ecclesias-
tics took the bait, but when the announce-
ment was made that “the greatest religious
festival ever to be held in Australia” would
take place on the Flemington Racecourse, the
sectarian cat was out of the bag. Other
denominations denounced the idea as
impious, and ordinary intelligent citizens
damned it' as absurd. At this stage the
V.R.C. cleared the sultry atmosphere by
announcing that it had religious scruples
of its own, and must decline to allow the
course to be used for the purpose proposed.
So Miss Johnson will land on Monday at
Moonee Valley, and experience has shown
that even with the smaller attendance ex-
pected an army of police will be barely able
to prevent the crowd becoming a mob.
Snow clouds darkened the sun and the
rain froze into hailstones at times for the
first day of the King’s Birthday meeting at
Flemington, and feminine dressing was a
matter of coats and goloshes. Everybody
wore goloshes, and people who had bought
them only that morning told in awed tones
of the tremendous number of persons who,
according to the young man who took their
measure, had beaten them to the bright idea
in the same shop. Seven thousand was
mentioned by one enthusiastic purchaser, but
she must have got it mixed with the number
of her car. At lunch-time it was revealed
that tweeds are still holding the field for
woman’s winter wear, which is a very good
thing for Australia, since this Chatterer has
been credibly informed that it is almost
impossible to make tweed without using some
wool. As for the topcoats, those of colored
leather, worn with berets of the same hue,
were favored by flappers, and there was the
usual seasonal array of furs. In the mem-
bers’ pen were Mayoress Luxton, who wore
a black cloth coat with mink collar and
cuffs; Mrs. L. K. S. Mackinnon, wife of the
V.R.C. chairman ; Mrs. A. Currie and Mrs.
Rupert Downes, the last-named in a suit
of heather tweed jersey cloth and fawn hat.
Mrs. J. S. Feelian, wdio was with Mrs.
Downes, wore fawn-toned tweed, with one
of the new knitted head-coverings of the
sort known as “fisherman’s cap.” Meta
Power, Mrs. John Turnbull, Mrs. A. V.
Kewney, in black trimmed with fox fur; Mrs.
Rogers Thomson, in costume of deep beige
tone and blending felt hat; and her daugh-
ter Kathleen, with red leather coat and stone-
colored felt hat, were others who faced the
weather. Mr. and Mrs. A. V. Hiskens, the
Ben Chaffeys, Captain and Mrs. Dawson,
and Dr. and Mrs. Barrv Thomson were
there, Mrs. Thomson and Mrs. W. Mitchell
wearing coat-posies of lily-of-the-valley and
orchids.
Naval, military and Air Force uniforms
made an effective foil for chiffon and silk
frocks at the United Services Ball, held in
Essendon Town Hall last week. The. colors
of the sSth Rifles Battalion were prominent
in the decorative scheme. Lord Somers went
to the dance with his lady, whose- sable-
collared gold la<me coat covered deep blue
georgette. The Mayor and Mayoress Fenton,
she in soft raiment of black, welcomed dis-
tinguished guests.
The “winter sales” have commenced,
though the winter has just begun. You get
things a bit cheaper, it is true, but it. runs
away with time. In the showrooms you wait
and wait while unperturbed sales-girls pull
clothes on and push clothes off their vic-
tims. There is nowhere to sit down to wait,
because the chairs and lounges bear heaps of
rejected coverings. In the scrum it is diffi-
cult to tell the shoppers from the servers,
since ununiformed helpers have been engaged
and many bargain-seekers wander around
hatless. To attend these bargain-contests
with any definite shopping mission in view
is a waste of energy. The best that can be
hoped for is that one may drop across some-
thing cheap that may come in handy some
time—a sort of White Knight method of
selection.
The cosy clubrooms of the Victoria League
offered a haven from a rain-splashed city
and chilly atmosphere on King’s Birthday,
when six hostesses did the honors. The
Allen lady found the occasion a good one
to push the interests of the V.L. library,
which provides books, papers and magazines
for people in lighthouses, remote wireless
stations, the Solomon Islands and other
places where they can’t buy an evening
newspaper. It was divulged that 9000 books
and 3000 magazines are annually distributed
to the exiles. Dawn Harding and Capt.
G. S. Doorly sang for the company some
ditties which the captain had set to music
himself; the words he had written when
he was chief officer of the Morning and
that gallant craft was scouring Antarctica
for Captain Scott and his party in 1902.
The Victoria League made a bid for the
support of the junior members of society at
a tea party at Mrs. Arthur Hordern’s flat
one afternoon last week. The Mitchell and
Creswell ladies expatiated on the League’s
mission, and seven companies of workers
were collected. Rear-Admiral Munro Kerr
was -made head of the new battalion,
with Mrs. Frank Faulkner as h'on. sec.
The maintenance of the bush library and the
entertainment by the younger members of
our best families of visiting members of
overseas branches were the objects most
directly aimed at.

The Oxford Club, intellectual in tone, is
located at Oakleigh Hall, East St. Kilda,
which has many associations with the early
political history of the State. Built by
Ambrose Kyte, the old house has shel-
tered three of the royal Princes who
have visited Australia —-the last being
the Duke of York, now George V. Samuel
Wilson was at one time the owner of the
mansion, and a later occupant was Pri-
minister Fisher, who held many a cabinet
meeting there. Some of the fine trees about
the well-laid-out grounds were planted by
the Duke of Edinburgh, and the room that
potentate occupied is still pointed out to
visitors. Miss W. Bansgrove, who pur-
chased the place from the late Andrew
Fisher, is running the club upon up-to-date
residential lines, with ballroom, cardrooms,
tennis courts and all the modern appurten-
ances.
Royal Melbourne Golf Club has announced
its intention of building a new clubhouse
that will cost about £30,000. Designed on
the lines of an old English manor, it will be
perched on a rise on the Sandringham links,
near the 9th hole. The house will have
residential!, accommodation for 15 members,
in addition to a wing devoted to the com-
fort of associate women members. Another
golf development projected is the conversion
of the space on Spencer-street between the
new bridge and Queen’s Bridge into a
miniature golf course. A cafe, a drive and
flower beds are included in the scheme for
beautifying this stretch of the Yarra bank.
Robin redbreasts and icicles were all that
was required to complete the English Christ-
mas effect of the dressing at a wedding which
took place at the Church of England Gram-
mar School chapel on Thursday. The bride,
Mildred Sanger, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
.1. W. Nicholas, of Monaro Yale, Berrigan,
N. S. Wales, wore the conventional lengthy,
long-sleeved ivory satin garment, over which
trailed a veil of Honiton lace. Barbara
Bayles and Betty Mills, her ’maids, bright-
ened the picture with holly-red chiffon frocks
and straw hats of the same color, and they
carried posies of berries and foliage. Max
Armstrong, of Bungowaunah Park, Albury,
a son of the T. S. Armstrongs, of Marnong,
Mickleham, was the bridegroom. The after-
rejoicings took place at No. 9.
A Dickinson-Monteath camera caught this
glimpse of Barbara Bryans, one of the bevy
o f amateurs
who appeared
iu the revue
“I n c r edible
II a p pen in gs”
at the Bijou.
She has a
talent for the
stage, and
has been a
bright ray in
many a char-
ity show in
which she has
taken a
comedy role.
The Women’s
Hospital and
the O.W.A.
shared the
takings of the
p r o d u ction
that provided
her latest
opportunity.
In the course of “Incredible Happenings'’
pianist Henry Penn was joined by the two
Blogg girls, Gwenith and Betty, in music for
three pianos—“Penn and His Nibs,” the
turn was styled. The Nibs, who have just
returned from Europe, wore long frocks
whose white satin bodices melted into
flounces of cream, orange and ruddy-toned
tulle. The ballet’s costumes included romper
suits of red and white check gingham, blue
satin overalls and frothy skirts of silk net,
surmounted with glistening haloes. Beryl
and Maisie Cowper did duo dances grace-
fully. Barbara Bryans, in sports attire or
masher suit, crooned ragtime ditties to a
banjo accompaniment. Joyce Turner was
well in the spotlight, her attire ranging from
a tulle Paris model to the garb of a con-
ventional comedy kid. Bea Fischer was
a charming widow in black velvet. Nancy
Syme and Natalie Wood sported yellow and
blue chiffon frills in a woodland scene, with
diaphanous hats. Norman Atkyns stage-
managed. The first-night audience included
Lord and Lady Somers, her Ex., who col-
lected a gorgeous bouquet, wearing a beau-
tiful Oriental coat over a green chiffon
frock. The Mayoral Luxtons, the Mitchell
lady, Mrs. James Alston and Mrs. J. S.
Fraser, president of C.W.A., were gathered
about the vice-regals.
The latest assault on the sanctity of the
Sabbath is from the air. The Larkin Air-
craft Co. has lately started Sunday “affter-
noon-tea” flights. On the opening day over
1000 people flocked to Coode Island aero-
drome, which is less than 10 minutes from
the centre of Melbourne, and over 80 went
up.
We were told the other day that the
notion of observing good Queen Vic.’s birth-
day as Empire Day had its origin in Mel-
bourne. This information was imparted at
the unveiling of a drinking-fountain in Surrey
Gardens, erected to the memory of the late
Arthur Brooks by the Surrey Hills Pro-
gress Association. To Mr. Brookes, who was
one of the founders of the S.H.P.A., is
attributed the suggestion.
Reynard was chased over fences and pad-
docks round Cranbourne for nearly 12 miles
at the first run this season of the Melbourne
Hunt Club. A chill wind and a spatter of
rain didn’t daunt the ardor of the 80 or so
who joined the meet at the new kennels.
There was many a cropper, and Generals
Johnston and Blarney were among the fallen,
but the services of the Army Medical Corps
weren’t required. Pink coats a<re getting paler
almost every day, for our four hunt clubs
are in full blast.
The Geoffrey Syme residence at Kew was
recently the scene of a young people’s dance,
the hostesses being Felicity, a daughter of
the house, Mi-, and Mrs.' Herbert Syine'f-
chick Barbara and Judith Campbell. The
trio had the aid of their respective mammas
in engineering the function. Mrs. Geoff
Syme’s good looks were set off by reseda-
green lace; Mrs. Herbert Syme had silver
embellishment on her black robe; and Mrs.
Charles Campbell displayed the fashionably
unevenness of skirt hem-line in a frock of
wine-red georgette. Felicity Syme wreathed
her dark hair with leaves to enhance the
effect of a gown of white chiffon sprayed in
floral design in pastel hues; madonna-blue
georgette was worn by her cousin ; and the
third miss was in primrose ninon. Com-
mander and Mrs. Geoff Haggard, she in a
patterned black frock, Mrs. Oswald Sym<
and some other relations were there. Cynthia
and Elaine Brookes and Betty Corbin, from
Adelaide, the last-named with a froth of
flounces of bronze tulle linked to a velvet-
embossed bodice, were among the young
dancers.

a serious business, and in - his lightei

bcen busy of late airing his views on tin
optimistic attitude adopted by Acting-Minis
ter for Customs Forde. Peacock reckons that
the encouragement given to overseas maim
facturers to set themselves up in Australia
isn’t as good as it sounds. Though it means
wages for out-of-works, the profits, or most
of them anyway, go over to Yankeeland or
Deutschland or some such outlandish spot.
Peacock tells us that Australia is gradually
selling herself to foreign interests, and tin-
country is being bled. But if Australians
won’t jump in and do the jobs that are wait-
ing to be done—well, this Chatterer really
doesn’t know how the invasion from overseas
is to be helped.
‘‘l enjoyed it immensely,” said a woman
as she left the King’s Theatre on Saturday

characteristic verdict on “This Thing Called

Nancy Gordon wears a cream lace gown
that terminates in flounces bordered with
brown tulle. Another of the faintest pink
lace has billows of tulle cascading from a
long pipe-like tunic. Mary Macgregor's
evening frock of black taffeta and lace shows
a lining of pink about the skirt licm ; and her
oyster-grey satin garb is finished with cream
chiffon collars and cuffs piped with rose.
Rowena Ronald does her vamping in fine
black lace over pale green, and, as the vamp-
ing progresses, dons a blue satin gown with
a cape that opens on the shoulder. Dulcie
Cherry dresses herself on the stage, starting
with an undergarment of ecru lace anil
green satin, a foundation for a bunchy
taffeta frock of apricot tone with oddments
of ribbon and roses in shaded brown tones
hitched about the hip-line.
Girl Guides and Brownies gave Sybil
Irving, their State secretary, an original
send-off. Just as the boa*t was leaving, a
couple of these young folk stepped on board
with a mail-bag full of letters containing
good wishes for her holiday. A substantial
bank draft was handed to Miss Irving at
headquarters earlier in the week. The
Chauvel lady, as deputy-State-Commandant,
entertained the voyager at a farewell lun-
cheon at the Alexandra Club.
Elsie Woolley, an Adelaide songbird who
has had training abroad, carried off the Sxjn
aria prize at the Bendigo competitions. Her
mezzo-soprano voice greatly impressed the
judges and other critics.

The Leslie Stuarts’ Toorak home was in-
vaded by bridge players on Thursday after-
noon and evening, and St. Martin’s and St.
John’s C.E. Home for Boys profited. The
chatelaine of Logan House, besides lending
her ballroom and reception-rooms, provided
the four-o’clock snack. The St. Kilda-South
Yarra helpers of the institution have now
every hope of securing the £l5O they are
after. Mrs. Ernest Poolman, their president,
Mrs. Alfred Couchman and Mrs. Fred
Krcrouse, who shared secretarial duties, and
Mrs. J. Beacham Kiddle, who looked after
the finance, were the chief engineers of the
party. Sales of flowers and .sweets and some
raffles brought in coin.
A knot-tying of interest in Uni. circles
was that of Doris Pittard and Geoffrey
Green. The bride, who wore ivory chiffon
velvet with a cascade of Limerick descend-
ing from a circlet of orange buds, had as
’maids Dr. Pleyell and Dr. Walker, who
added a touch of blue to their chiffon frocks
just for luck. There were rejoicings after-
wards at the Lyceum Club rooms.

Synopsis : His father. Bob Cal-
laway, drowned at the bar of the
Passage, Lew has to support his
mother, Hughie and two other child-
ren. Lew is a fisherman, satisfied
enough with the life, but slightly dis-
gruntled at the idea of having to carry
the heavy end of the log all his days.
He resents the determination of his
mother ( Anna ) not to allow Hughie
to become a fisherman. But Hughie,
Lew admits to himself, has brains: it
was Hughie Uncle Tony called when
anything was wrong with his boat: so
when Kunkcl offers Hughie a job at
his store Lew agrees that he should
take it. Hughie buys a motor-lorry,
and soon is running a car service. He
docs so well that he goes to town to
set up in car business. Anna had been
disturbed over Lew's attachment for
Clem McNair, daughter of a man
who made money out of patent medi-
cine and has sold a large area of land
on one side of the Passage to Osborne,
a speculator, who has started a young
township upon it. Lew's diffidence
prevents closer relationship, and Clem,
disappointed, decides to go abroad.
Lew then marries Lena Christensen,
ivho had been keeping company with
Craig, a surveyor, but had. assured
Lew that affair was “all off.”
CHAPTER XX.
Peter.
PETER was a seven-months child. That
was what Dora Wiegert and the other
women were always reminding Lew
consolingly when he looked worried about
the future of the frail little mite that seemed
to have so feeble a grip on life. Lots of
youngsters like that grew surprisingly after
the first year or two, they said. Peter
would be big as his father some day!
It. was hard to believe,, especially during
his first summer when they were fighting
to keep him alive on the strippingsi of the
best Jersey Lew could procure in the coun-
try around. Peter didn’t seem to have any
of the robust will to live that had marked
all the Callaway children, making their
rearing an easy business for Anna. There
was a wan look about him, and the image
of his puckered little face and undersized
body was continually with Lew as he moved
about his work on the big jetty it had
been necessary to build since the arrival
of the new boat. Lew had always been
proud of his strength, and took for granted
any son of his would inherit it. It had
been a bad blow to learn that the child
he had fathered only weighed five pounds
and was so weak it couldn’t take its
mother’s milk.
But the very weakness of Peter intensi-
fied Lew’s affection as the youngster grew.
In the long, hot nights, when he carried
him up and down the verandah, trying to
soothe him into a few hours’ sleep, a pro-
tective passion stirred in him and gathered
weight. Threads of life went out from him
around the small body. They were rein-
forced by the memory of Lena lying back
among the pillows, flushed, but self-
possessed, the tiny, red-faced atom in the
crook of her arm, and a peculiar smile
flickering through her eyes.
“Well.” she had asked him. “Satisfied
now. Lew?”
At first he hadn’t grasped her full mean-
ing.
“Satisfied?”
“Better be,” she told him. “I’m not
going through it again.”
She was serene and happy, but there was
a look he recognised in the lines of her
mouth. It was no mere reaction of the
moment, this determination not to bear
any more children. She had been pondering
on the matter and had made up her mind.
Lew didn’t care, one way or the other,
for he had never looked ahead and counted
on having a family; yet Lena’s ultimatum
made Peter more precious in his eyes.
Rahilly and the other men laughed at the
way he would sometimes drop his hammer
and look up attentively at the. house when
a thin wail pierced the morning air. They
laughed more when they came upon him
sitting on a chair beside the stove, drooling
out baby talk to the child as he gave it
the bottle. Queer to see Lew so thoroughly
under the thumb of this tiny fragment of
whimpering life! You wouldn’t have
thought he was the sort to grow so foolish
over a youngster! He rarely made a trip
to town with the boat now, and when he
did there was always a strained look on
his face as they neared the jetty. Not till
he heard that Peter was all right would his
muscles relax.
“You can tell the state of the kid’s
stomach by the look in Lew’s eyes,” Rahilly
said. “Poor old Lew! Gets his head out
of one family noose only to stick it in
another.”
Even Lena joked about Lew’s solemn
preoccupation with the child’s well-being.
She was fond of Peter herself in her lazy,
careless fashion, but no anxiety about his
health ever kept sleep from her eyes.
There was an amused detachment on her
face when she watched him sprawling naked
on a. rug, or chewing at the silver case of
Lew’s watch. Babies were queer little
animals! Was she really the mother of
this one? At any rate no one would doubt
that Lew was the father; Peter’s dark little
face had his coloring, his intensity, even
his rather shapeless features.
“A real Callaway to look at,” people
said. “Though he’s more like his grand-
mother than any of the rest.”
It didn’t please Lena to be reminded of
the child’s grandmother. If that were all
the reward for what she had gone
through
In spite of the relief Anna’s absence gave
her, life had grown dull for Lena since the
family had gone to town. The cottage was
occupied by the Haigs, a sour, hard-living
couple with very little to say and no
interest in anything but their growing
children and the need of making every
shilling do double work. Milly, the eldest
girl, helped Lena in the house; her mother
did the washing; but their attitude towards
Lena was dry and defensive, as if they
secretelv resented having to work for her.
Haig himself had been a railwayman once
and had been sacked with a few others, so
the rumor went, because of the way goods
had a habit of disappearing from the trucks
they handled. It was a grievance that had
eaten into the very bones of the family, so
that even the fifteen-year-old Milly had a
sullen look as she slopped about the house,
warming Peter’s bottle and carrying the
breakfast things out of the kitchen.
“Some people have all the luck,” her
eyes said when she saw Lena lounging in
her deck-chair.
But Lena was far from realising her
privileges; She missed the little jaunts in
Hughie’s car, the sound of his horn on
drowsy afternoons (“You inside, Lena?
Coming for a spin as far as the new
hotel?”), and the atmosphere of breezy
good-humor he brought to the house when
he dropped in for an occasional meal. Then
there had been Dot, always lively and
ready to go with her to the dances in the
hall on Saturday nights. Nowadays the
flat seemed to be more cut off than ever
from the new world that was growing up
at Lavinia. Visitors from Osborne’s hotel
sometimes wandered down to stare curi-
ously at the men mending their nets, the
unloading of cargo when the boat was in,
the piles of queer junk in the Wiegerts’
back yards; but their noses were usually
wrinkled apprehensively, as if they were
afraid of contamination from the smell of
stale fish and mullet-weed. And the fisher-
men, even Lew 7 , resented their presence.
“Blasted nosey packers! Asking silly
damn questions any youngster’d know.
Why don’t they stay where they belong?”
Lena, sitting on the verandah in the
drowsy afternoons, rocking Peter’s cradle
with her foot, had' a sense of silence creep-
ing in on her, lowering her vitality. This
was very different from the rowdy, vivid
life she had expected when she married
Lew. Vaguely she had pictured herself
queening it over a crowd of men, taking
the wheel of the boat as it moved down
the Passage, racing along the sands bare-
backed when the tide was out, organising
picnic parties when the summer visitors
were down. Eyes upon her always, men’s
eyes, in which she could see herself radiant
and magnetic! But those around her had
long ceased to take any particular notice
of her. She was just Lew’s wife, a part of
the place. And she had nothing in common
with Dora Wiegert, Dave’s wife, Mrs. Haig,
or the other w'omen. She was bored by
their talk of their illnesses, or the different
ways they had of cooking fish to make
their men eat it; it irritated her to have
to listen to their advice about the rearing
of Peter. That was the worst of being' a
mother! It brought you down to the level
of any old trollop who had borne children.
And it was no comfort to learn that
Hughie and the family were beginning to
do well in town. Hughie had set up in
business, and thej r were talking of building
a modem bungalow of their Own at the
Hamilton. Dot’s bubbling, girlish letters
gave the impression of a continual round
of concerts and motor picnics.
“You’d enjoy the life here better even
than I do, Lena,” she wrote. “I sometimes
feel you have rather a dull time of it back
there. Couldn’t you and I swap places for
awhile? I’d just love looking after Lew
and Peter.” .
But the thought of living under the same
roof as Anna, even for a few weeks,
brought a grimace to Lena’s lips. Some-
thing would snap if they were thrown to-
gether for very long.
Indeed the thought of being free from
Anna’s watching eyes almost made her
contented with her lot; though sometimes
when she went over to Lavinia and saw the
women playing golf on the new course and
the crowd of visitors about the hotel, she
had a particularly acute disgust with the
life of the Passage. How free and irrespon-
sible these women in colored jumpers and
plaid skirts looked! As if they never knew
what it was to have a dull and sodden
moment! But it was hard to make even
occasional visits to Lavinia now that
Hughie had gone.
“Why don’t you get a car, Lew?” she
asked. “We’re stuck in a hole down here
like an old punt on a mudbank. Barnacles
growing all over us.”
Lew’s face was merely stolid.
“Can’t run to it. We’ll have to scratch
for another year or two to pay off the new
boat.”
“Oh, that boat!” she retorted. “I’m fed
up with hearing about that boat. Do you
ever think of anything else on God’s
earth, Lew?”
“Yes,” he parried, bending down over the
youngster’s cradle. “About Peter.... Got
to have a water-tight pair of shoes for you
to step into when you’re ready, haven’t I,
boy?”
And he chuckled as the small hands
waved like tentacles and the itching gums
finally fastened on his calloused forefingeff.
Lena was exasperated.
“You old plodder, Lew! I thought you
took pride once in never looking ahead.
Now you do nothing else—just like a
drayhorse in blinkers. ‘We’ve got to build
up something for Peter.... Peter’s future
is what we’ve got to consider.’ What’s the
good of talking like that? If Peter’s got
any spunk in him he won’t want to step
into anyone’s shoes—he’ll kick them out
of his road.”
“Perhaps so. More power to him.”
“You say that, but all the same you want
us to scrimp and save and miss any life
that’s going. Not for me, thank you.”
She was jealous, not exactly of Peter, but
of Lew’s absorption in him. He never
seemed to give her his full attention now,
no matter how she was dressed or what
she was talking about. Their married life
had become a matter of habit, only rising
at its highest point to perfunctory caresses
and phrases that had lost all their sap;
she longed to do something that would
rouse that fiery glow in Lew that had once
attracted her. There was a glow about him
still, but it came from banked fires some-
where away down. The things that fanned
it and brought depth to his eyes were never
things that touched her own feelings. She
wondered whether he would take her so
much for granted if there were other men
about.
And at such times she thought of Craig
and the first passionate kisses he had*
pressed on her mouth behind the crumbling
grape trellis at Glenrowan. She could feel
the lift of her body towards him, the
flicker of her heart beneath his hand. There
had hardly been a word spoken, then or
after, that she could remember; Craigie
was not the sort of man to make love with
his tongue or give reassurances. It had been
the way he looked at her, his bold direct-
ness in moments of passion and his easy
camaraderie at other times, that had con-
vinced her no other woman would ever
count with him. How little she had known
of the world then, or the ways of men!
She would never forgive Craigie for going
off with such casual abruptness, not even
bothering to send her a line..
But it was rarely she thought of him
with any bitterness or poignancy. No senti-
mental mooning over the past for her! She
was fond of Lew in her own way, proud
of having a man who, as Mrs. Dave said,
“could walk a plank with two hundred of
flour on his back and never bat an eye.”
Then there was little Peter. It was amus-
ing to watch him grow, to find him picking
up some fresh trick every day, to puzzle
out what he meant by the strange sounds
he repeated over and over. She liked
taking him down to the edge of the Passage
in the mornings, lying in the sand with
a novel while he kicked and splashed in
three inches of water. Suck of the tide,
clang of men’s voices from the spindly
jetty, drowsy warmth flooding in from
above and around....
So passed the first years of her married
life.
CHAPTER XXI.
A Voice prom the Past.
“You’ll be glad to know I’ve been work-
ing very hard. I’ve just painted a head
and hands of the most charming French
lady imaginable. M. Loubet is absurdly
pleased with it. He seems to be delighted
at the rate I’ve got on—but he needn’t
be. I’m leaving him next month because
lie’s too pleased with me—like my restless-
ness and ingratitude, isn’t it? But I’m
always desperately afraid of becoming
satisfied with myself”....
It was Clem’s voice speaking, breaking
in upon a silence that seemed to have
washed around Lew for years, repeating
itself in his inner ear. A queer under-
current, of excitement moved through him
at the sound of it. Sitting in his office
at the end of the verandah, with the
shaded lamp throwing a circle of yellow
light over his table, he took out the
crumpled envelope with the foreign post-
mark and pored over the small, irregular
writing, though he knew every word ot it
by heart. The queer thing was that Clem
didn’t attempt to give any detailed account
of her life in the last few years; she just
plunged into the maze of her immediate
interests, taking for granted he could fol-
low her. She had been staying with some
other students at Florennes, a little village
on the Mediterranean coast, and the color
and Light had reminded her of home.
Curdy-white beaches and seas that almost
blinded your eyes with their greeny-blue
glitter! She didn’t want to come back
yet, though. Perhaps she would feel the
need to return some day, when she had
grown more sure of herself.
But to Lew that letter, straying in so
unexpectedly, had the effect of bringing her
back with extraordinary vividness. He
hadn’t thought of her very much. The
background of her life had seemed so
remote and beyond his power to imagine
that she herself had become unreal. Her
very features were elusive; he could only
remember them when he looked at an old
snapshot of her, taken over on the sand-
bank—bloomers, bare legs, eyes screwed
up against the sun glare. And he himself
had changed since then, toughened and
hardened, become thoroughly immersed in
his business of running the two boats and
making a comfortable living for the family.
Rarely did anyone find him lying on hi?
back staring at the flight of a. bird or the
shape of a tree now. From the time he
rose till the time he went to bed. hardly

a thought passed through his mind that
hadn’t some practical end.
Yet here was Clem talking as if there
had been continuity in their lives and
their growth had been together! He was
astonished at the way the written words
had made her alive for him again, put
breath and substance into a vague image.
He could almost feel her in the room, hear
the rhythm of her voice. A disturbing
awareness was in all his being; beneath
the crust that had formed on him delicate
nerves of memoiy were quickening; he was
conscious of rising out of his own life a
little and looking at it with detached eyes.
Clem hadn’t asked him any questions, but
the echo of her words evoked them froip
the empty air around. Hadn’t some of the
spring gone out of him lately? Wasn’t he
becoming content just to plod along, with
one eye fixed on what he was paying out
for wages and the other on his returns for
freight? Life! There should be some-
thing more in it than that!
Two things that had been worrying him
lately were Hughie’s requests for help and
Lena’s restless desire for a change. For
some months Lena had been trying to per-
suade him to leave the old home he had
become so fond of and build a new one
on the blocks he held at Lavinia. She was
always poring over modern architectural
designs in magazines, and the variety of
arguments she could bring to bear on him
was amazing.
“‘Daddy,’ came a small, treble voice.”
“Surely to goodness, Lew, you don’t need
to live on top of your work like old
Kunkel at the store! If you had a car
you could run down every day from Lav-
inia. What’s the good of piling up money
if all you get out of it is just enough
to feed and cover you? This place isn’t
good for Peter —there’s hookworm about.
You’ve said yourself it must be hookworm
that keeps the youngest Haig kid so stunted.
And the sandflies get worse every summer.
Peter’s always scratching and the sores take
such a long time to heal.”
Any reference to Peter always touched
a live spot in Lew, although he knew Lena
was only using the boy as a trump in the
playing of her hand. It was nonsense, of
course, to say the place wasn’t healthy;
all his own family had been reared there,
and when had they ever wanted a doctor?
Yet Peter certainly wasn’t thriving; he
slept and ate too little, and his face looked
older than his body. Hookworm? There
had been talk of it a couple of years
before when one of Dave Wiegert’s young-
sters was in hospital.
What annoyed him, though, was that
Lena had got it into her head that he was
making money and was too mean to
spend it.
“You old Shylock, Lew,” she sometimes
twitted him.
And it was one of the few taunts that
stung; he had always loathed men who
were tight about money, and yet here he
was, still looking twice at every shilling!
Was it his fault he had been forced into
that, though? It was true he was doing
well since the second boat had been put
on the run and the Lavinia stores were
giving him all their carrying, but he had
heavy debts to pay off even yet. And
now there was Hughie asking for financial
help! First it had been a loan of fifty
pounds, then of a couple of hundred; finally
what he wanted was general backing for a
Tourist Service he and his partner were
organising. Lew had complete confidence
in Hughie, but he had come to believe that
the boy was biting off more than he could
chew.
He turned to his figures for a few
minutes and then let his pen drop and
felt among the papers on the table for his
pipe and plug of tobacco. Queer how
Clem’s phrases kept running up and down
in his head, churning up something inside
him, making him wonder if he wasn’t grow-
ing set and sodden! She was as far away
from him as the moon, really!
“Daddy!” came a small, treble voice.
It was Peter, pattering in through the
half-open door in pyjamas to say good-
night before he went to his cot on the
verandah. A few excited steps and then a
bump as he tripped on the seagrass mat and
fell against a chair. At the sharp yell of
pain Lew bounded up and took the dazed
youngster in his arms, soothing him clum-
sily and bluffing him out of his fright.
“It’s all right, Peter! Why, man alive,
you’re not going to make a song about a
little thing like that, are you? Hurt the
chair more than it hurt you, I’ll bet!....
Show me! No, not even a mark! What
a hard little nut you’ve got, Peter! Going
to butt into all sorts of things before you’re
a man, isn’t it?”
The boy was hiding his head on Lew’s
shoulder, ashamed of the fit of sobbing that
still shook him. He hadn’t wanted to cry;
he was always trying to control himself.
But the world was full of things that leapt
at you when you weren’t expecting them,
knocking you over and sending a flood of
terror through you!
“'Here, sit down and tell me about Marie’s
puppies,” said Lew r taking him on his knee.
“Did she snap at you to-day?”
No, she hadn’t! And Peter had gone
quite close and patted her—he was proud
of that. Three of the four puppies had
their eyes open. The Haigs wanted one of
them, but they mustn’t have the black one.
Lew held the youngster close to him,
listening to his inconsecutive prattle about
the things that had happened during the
day. What had always worried him was
Peter’s fear of being hurt, and he patiently
tried to understand the funk that paralysed
the boy when any small risk had to be
undertaken. How often had he perched
Peter on some stump a foot high and held
his hand tight:
“Now then, Peter. Jump!”
And Peter, white-faced and tight-lipped,
would nerve himself to make the effort.
Sometimes, even, Lew caught him practising
by himself, bracing his will till he looked
like a delicate bit of mechanism that had
been wound up tight. There was no doubt
about his pluck. All that was wrong with
him was that he seemed to carry in his
mind some image of a violent and mon-
strous world that was intent on crushing
his feeble little body. His mother couldn’t
understand that! She laughed at his fears
in a queer, unrestrained way, as if they
were as funny as his struggles with long
words.
“Bedtime, Peter!” she called, coming
to the half-open door. “Why, you ought
to have been asleep an hour ago.”
“That’s right,” said Lew, dropping him
from his knee. “Run along, Peter.”
But Lena picked the boy up by the door
and dandled him in the air, holding him
out from her with a laugh and then burying
her face in his neck. A darkness fell over
Lew’s eyes. He couldn’t bear Lena’s way
with Peter, and that was the truth. She
had an instinct to tease him. stirring com-
plex emotions of anger and jealousy in
him when she pretended to go off and
leave him for the day, smothering him with
baby talk and caresses at the wrong times.
There was an unpleasant hint of flirtation
in all this, and it was more than the bov
could cope with.
“Run along, Peter!” repeated Lew, with
a frown.
The boy stumbled off in a sleepy way to
his cot on the verandah, but when he had
gone Lena lingered in the room desultorily,
picking up some of Lew’s papers from the
floor where the wind had blown them,
straightening the chintz cover of the sofa,
yawning sleepily behind her hand. There
was nothing to keep her there, but she
didn’t want to go. She was annoyed by
Lew’s tone, and she resented the way he
shut himself up in his room of an evening.
It couldn't be that there was so much work
to do! He had merely got into the habit
of drooling over papers, like some old
soaker at the pub with his pint of beer!
Sitting on the edge of the table, with one
leg swinging, she determined to catch his
attention and hold it. Her fingers itched
to rumple his hair, to tweak it even, and
rouse him to a sense of her presence.
“Who’s that from?” she asked, her eyes
suddenly resting on the envelope with a
foreign stamp.
Lew’s hand instinctively w'ent out to
cover it.

The Jaw students gave their ball at the
Troeadero. There was a court scene at
the entrance to the ballroom with a red-
robed, wlnte-wigged Judge weighing the
issues before a jurybox. The ballroom
■was m grey, like a prison yard, and jury
*°° m s. flock, marriage registry office and
uit “mi were in the alcoves round the
kail. The players in the orchestra wore
wigs and gowns ; and a ballet performed legal
burlesques. Poinsettia branches were in the
supper-room. Chief Justice Blair and his
ffidy received Sir John and Lady Goodwin.
T*? r x - ' v Y as 111 nasturium-tinted mariette.
Miss C. Beirne, of Ipswich, was the only deb.
The Mater Children’s Hospital Ball took
place in the City Hall. Decked with vases
°t Pale pink roses and sweet-pea, the v.-r
table looked very pretty; a debs.’ cake
vyas placed on a pedestal alongside, and
the Governor cut it. Lady Goodwin
received the top tier. Pale-blue tulle and
crystal vases of narcissi and roses were on
the debs, table, the room being decorated
with a canopy of blue and white. The Gov-
ernor was met by Mrs. H. J. Windsor, who
presented Lady Goodwin with crimson roses
and maidenhair. Lady Goodwin wore dull
gold lace, and Mrs. Windsor was in black
Chantilly. Mrs. Windsor presented the IS
buds who carried pink and white posies.
Betty Davies, author of “A Touch of
Silk, was feted by the Repertory Society at
the Dante Society’s rooms, Barbara Sisley
being hostess. The playwright was pre-
sented with a posy of deep red roses and
violets, tied with ribbons. Mrs. Davies, who
was accompanied by her husband, wore
ocean-green taffetas and a pastel-blue chif-
fon coat with white fox furs. Miss Sislev
was in mustard-yellow with black satin cape.
Vance Palmer’s “Telling Mrs. Baker” and
Mrs. J. S. Barrie’s “Seven Women” figured
in the evening’s entertainment.
The Victorian League had it* third annual
summing-up in the Mayoress’s room at the
City Hall, ivhich was decked with red roses
and Union Jack. Lady Goodwin was in
the chair. Sir John arriving later. Jean
Rigby and Gwen Bradfield sang.
Poinsettia decorated the Carlton cabaret
when a dance and bridge party were held to
open the post-graduate course of the B.M.A.
Dr. and Mrs. S. P. McDonald received the
guests, Mrs. McDonald wearing sea-green
with a Paisley wrap, and carrying a posy
of carnations and roses.
Poinsettia was also picked for the adorn-
ing of the Women’s Clubrooms on the oeca-
sion of- the at-home for the women graduates
m Brisbane for the Science Congress, Mrs.
E. B. Harris, the president, and the execu-
tive committee being hostesses. Mrs. Harris
and Gwen Hughes spoke, beginning with a
rebuke of the weather, which was rainy.
Gwen Hughes, Dr. Jean White Haney and
Dorothy Taylor were the main speakers, and
Victoria Blakey, Lena Hammond, Nellie
Gray, Gwen de Grant, , Cecile Pritchard,
Gladys Frost and Mary and Vada Jeffries
made music.

Grey clouds scuttled rudely in front of
the sun s face, but there were no showers
for the race meeting on Foundation Day. A
smart turnout was Mrs. Doy Forrest’s lemon
jersey suit with a contrasting black band on
her lemon hat. Mrs. Olden found a fox’s
winter coat sufficient protection for her lido-
blue georgettes. Brown headwear fetched
out the tones of Mrs. Archie Burt's tweeds.
Peter Moustaka was attractive in a grey
tailored coat and little grey hat, and tweed
suits and beige felts were chosen by Mrs. E.
Atkinson, \ iolet Holmes and Mary Hitch.
Mrs. George Ridgway was well tailored in
navy, and Mrs. Sidney Bell looked neat in
a black coat and skirt and white satin tuck-
in. Hope Robertson wore black satin and
a clever little black headpiece.
I’lay on the last of the three new Metro-
politan links was commenced by the
Governor, who followed up his drive
b.V joining in a Canadian men’s foursome.
The links are a boon to girls who earn their
own bread and butter, as they are open to
women as well as men members during
week-ends and on public holidays.
A few days before the Orsova took Coralie
Clarke off to London the women journalists
spread a dinner in her honor at the Karra-
katta Club. Miss Clarice was editor of
"Dawn,” the official organ of the Women's
Service Guild and sub-editor of the Uni.
“Black Swan.” Her pet interest, is.
however, the stage. She wrote, produced
and acted in a play for the Repertory Club
and intends to take advantage of her P. and
O. and Orient scholarship and delve into the
drama.
Bracing winter air and the prospect of
gallops over wet green paddocks is luring
young folk out of town. Moosie and Peggy
Butcher have migrated for the winter to their
station home, Nangetty. Yvonne Nairn is at
Geraldton and Beth Johnston is sampling
the attractions of rural life at the McKenzie
Grant’s Newmarraca-rra. The Merton Clif-
lons of York have Tinka Salom as a guest.
One of our pioneers, Mrs. Phoebe Growse,
passed her 94th milestone this week. She
came here as a child of seven and her father,
the Rev. Poslethwaite, was made incumbent
of the Anglican Church at Upper Swan.
She spent four years of her girlhood as com-
panion to Mrs. Fitzgerald, an early Gover-
nor s wife. Most of her married life was
spent at Toodyay, but when she was left a
widow with nine hungry young colonials to
S3* sh £ to ° k of the Northam school,
here she taught for 14 years.
i E ea }lbuyer J. B. Marco and his wife are
back in E erth. They have spent the last
few months dodging around Australia and
up through the East Indies collecting ocean
gems. They sail this month for their head-
quartersin Paris, with a break of journey in
Italy, where they will see something of Mrs
Marco s parents, the William Tiveys.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Only a Douglas Mawson could have
enjoyed the weather at Victoria Park for
the first of the three A.R.C. meetings. Even
i? i l *, coa t. s the poor women shivered. His
Lx. blew in for a short period, prior to
attending 1 arafield to witness the flying for
the Grosyenor Cup. There was a perfect
tush tor afternoon tea, and the committee
room was crowded. Chairman James
flail and his two pretty daughters dispensed
hospitality. Miss Hall chose a navy ensemble
and hat to match, and Gwen Hall sported a
co^ 1 t and a .small brown felt hat.
His Ex. presided at the potpourri of
annual meeting, afternoon tea and gift fete
organised by the Ladies’ Harbor Lights
Guild on behalf of the Mission for Seamen
at the Liberal Hall. The guild gave and
bought liberally. Mr. E. Lakeman was on the
platform and had to hide his blushes while
things were said by his Ex. and the Bishop
about his gift of the Lakeman Institute.
Music and afternoon tea helped to make
the affair a society gathering.
The Lyceum Club has had a bombshell
cast into its midst. The London Lyceum
lias written inviting all the members to con-
tribute short plays to the mother club, to
be presented as “made in Australia.” As
there are only two or three literary women
amongst the members, the request is causing
worry, because London seems to have great
expectations.
Lady llore-Ruthven opened a fete arranged
by. the City Division of the Girl Guides to
raise money for winter fuel for the sick
poor. There was a good attendance, and as
Mrs. 11. C. Cave (president) and an ener-
getic committee had seen to it that there was
no lack of things for sale, there was a satis-
factory financial return.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
R. Nettlefold did the honors for Clare-
mont Golf Club on President’s Day. Heavenly
weather tempted players to take their eyes off
the ball and enjoy the view. A good muster
included Mayor and Mayoress Soundy and
the Gepps.
Supporters of the clever little pianist
Jessie Wakefield organised a concert at the
Town Hall to swell a fund which is being
raised to send her abroad to study. His Ex.
and Mayor and Mayoress Soundy and all our
musical folk were there, and the gifted
youngster made a very good impression.
Mrs. T. K. Robson, formerly of Sydney
but now a Launceston resident, is a woman

Clcmes Dramatic Club revived “The Pri-
vate Secretary,” under the direction of John
Roylc, a*t the Clemes Memorial Hall, the
object being to raise the wind for a new
school laboratory. The play ran for two
nights to full houses.
Artist L. _ Deschaineux discoursed at a
recent Rotarian luncheon on the subject of
Ilobart s . architecture, offering the opinion
that, while climate and environment were
given due attention by the first builders of
the city, later additions copied from foreign
sources are giving the place a crazy-patch-
work appearance.
AT THE RACK OF THE NORTH .WIND.
Darwin.
At the civic welcome to Amy Johnson, the
Town Hall was crowded to the doors, and
Darwin cheered itself hoarse. The heroine
was in flying kit, breeches and shirt. At the
V ictoria League’s welcome in the evening she
appeared in a dainty silk dress of gold color,
with circular skirt, and gold stockings and
•shoes to match. Despite her long day’s fly-
ing she danced as vigorously as any.
The reporters who flew to Darwin to await
the arrival of Amy Johnson had to spend a
week kicking their heels in idleness, but
one of the pilots made hay while the sun
shone by taking eager Danvinites up for
five-minute flights at a pound a time. Among
those who went aloft was an aboriginal
named Banana, on the local Administration
staff. His white employers clubbed together
to give him a* fly, but judging from Banana’s
remarks when he found himself on terra-
firm a again, he didn’t enjoy the experience.
The Anglicans had a combined annual parish
meeting and garden party at the Rectory,
when welcomes were given to the Bishop of
Carpentaria and his wife, travelling through
on their way to the Lambeth Conference, and
to three missionaries and their wives, also
birds of passage, in whose company was the
chairman of the Australian Board of Mis-
sions.
Shelagh, daughter of the Gerald Piggotts,
formerly of Coogee, Sydney, and now of
North Australia, has given a promise to

“No one you know, Lena.... Someone
miles away.”
“Miles away?” she repeated. “And a
woman, too! It must be that McNair
girl. Who said I didn’t know her? I
remember her since God knows how 7 long,
coming here with her brothers for holidays.
What’s she writing about?”
“Nothing particular. Something reminded
her of this place, I guess.”
For a few moments curiosity gleamed in
Lena’s eyes, narrowing them to a point of
concentration. Did the letter mean any-
thing to Lew? He and this girl used always
to be out together when she was down, and
she remembered Craigie making a joke
about the pair of them.
“Had a sentimental attack, did she?” she
teased him. “Something reminded her of
this place and so she wrote to you
Going to tell her you’re finished, Lew—
that you’ve got a wife and little boy?”
Lew’s face had a stony, impervious look.
“It w'ouldn’t interest her. Not if I had
half a dozen of each.... What are you
getting at. Lena?”
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Lena, her laugh
coming jerkily. “When a girl comes to
writing to a man for news She didn’t
want to know wdiether Mina Kunkel had
had another operation, did she, or how the
Lavinia golf club was getting on?”
There was a hint of malice in her voice,
but only a hint. The McNair girl was too
remote from her to rouse her jealousy; she
found it hard to recall even her coloring.
And Lew was not given to running after
women. Sometimes she half wished he
would; there might be a bit of a fillip in
having to battle for him with a creature of
flesh and blood. What irked her was his
mere indifference, the difficulty of rousing
him from his sober preoccupation with his
work and with Peter. How good it would
be to see passion darkening his eyes again,
carrying him out of the rut and making
him do swift, unexpected things!
She sat dipping his pen in the ink and
making the little blobs spread on the
blotter. Still, though she changed the con-
versation from the McNair girl’s letter to
Peter’s failure to put on weight and the
way lots were selling at Lavinia, she couldn’t
capture Lew’s full attention. He sat back
in his cane chair, watching her hands rather
than her face, and letting his monosyllables
fall like slow drops of water from a plugged
tap. The bananas trailed against the tank;
Peter moved uneasily in his cot on the
verandah; the tinkle of a gramophone
sounded out from Haig’s cottage by the
water. Suddenly Lew leaned forward and
grabbed her by the wrist:
“For God’s sake, stop doing that! It’s
half-witted.”
She let the pen drop from her fingers,
her mouth falling open in astonishment.
“What is?”
“Stabbing at the blotter like that and
scattering ink about. It would get on the
nerves of a seal.”
She slid from the table with a queer
laugh, moving over to him and rumpling
his hair. There was an indolent triumph
in her eyes at having roused him.
“You old humbug, Lew, I didn’t think
you had any nerves! They’re generally
wrapped up in cotton wool, anyway.”
He was half ashamed of his outburst.
“And you want to strip off the covering,
eh?”
“Perhaps; but it isn’t easy.”
She stood back from him and looked at
him with lazy, half-closed eyes. Then she
linked her hands across his forehead, lean-
ing her weight down on him provocatively.
“Do you know what’s wrong with you,
Lew?” she said. “You’ve run on a mud-
bank and stuck there. Sitting up late every
night and stewing over those old papers!
It’ll make you grey and round-shouldered
before you’re fifty. Why don’t you run
round to the hotel at Lavinia now and
then in the evenings and see a bits of life?
Find out what the new barmaid’s like
they’re all talking about! Don’t think I’d
mind; there’s never been any dog-in-the-
manger about me.... I’m’going to bed
now. Coming?”
“In a while.... Or perhaps I’ll run round
to the pub in the truck before it closes.
See what that woman really is like.”
It was a response that came from him
half playfully, half mechanically.
But when she had gone, he went out to
the breakwater and lit another pipe, sitting
on the wooden coping and looking side-
ways at the dark hull- of the new boat that
was moored to the jetty. A vague unrest,
such as he hadn’t felt for years, was in his
blood. The faint skin that had been form-
ing over his days had been pierced, though
until now he hadn’t known it was there.
Was he beginning to realise that his life
with Lena lacked something? Yet he had
had a suspicion of that long ago, even be-
fore Peter was born. There was a cold-
ness inside her that her easy good humor
didn’t mask; perhaps it was the secret of
her good humor! Often when he had
thought he was getting close to her he had
touched that kernel of stone. Never had
he been able to penetrate the source of her
feelings, and he had come to hiding his
own from her. She wasn’t moved by the
sort of things that moved him.
But what did a man want in the woman
he lived with? In some ways they had
got along together well enough. Or was
it that he hadn’t asked much, that a habit
of day-to-day living had deadened him to
the sting and savor life used to hold for
him?
Haig’s dinghy drifted by in the dark, a
dim lantern in the bows, nets humped up
in the stem, oars moving in their rowlocks
without a creak. He knew by the way the
faint drip struck his ears that his senses
were more acute than usual. Strung up,
. was he? He could have choked Lena for
the way she prodded at the blotting-paper
with the wet pen. Yet it wasn’t just the
particular thing she was doing that created
the explosion in him. There must be some-
thing else nagging at him, deeper down
Voices from Haig’s jetty where the men
were unloading their catch, the firefly flicker
of a lantern backwards and forwards, a
gleam of phosphorescent white in the dusk
where a mullet leapt! Half-furtively Lew
looked over his shoulder at the window in
the front of the house. The light was
still burning there. He thought of Lena
lying half-undressed on the bed, turning
over the pages of a magazine; he saw the
lazy smile in her eyes when she opened the
door; a sudden repulsion shot through him.
Not till the light was long out would he
go inside.
{To be continued next week.)
The Dancer.
How she danced! And oh, the heels of her!
Light as a* feather that flies before the wind,
Linking hands with lusty youth to leave old
age behind!
How she danced! And oh, the smile of her!
In her dark eyes glancing like a springing
flame
And in her heart for ever the crying of a
name!
How she danced ! And oh, the grief of her!—
The terrible slow grief of her when her feet
were swift as wind !
She is dancing like a hunted thing to keep a;
fear behind.
How she danced! And oh, the love of her!
Danced till her feet were bruised, and failing
was her breath'.
Yet the only thing she did not fear, the
while she danced, was Death.

Black Bees.
Within a well-loved cave
That faces the green south,
We sought a shelter from the fiercer rain,
Saw through its curtain diaphane
White ridges at the river mouth
Where wave met adversary wave.
Rees on the wild water, raindrop bees,
Why did they swirl in ominous A’ortices?
No sand made soft the beach,
But a crushed bank of shells,
Storm-broken flakes of undefeated hue,
Carmine, and saffron, mussel-blue;
Chipped spiral cups and bells
Flung where the utmost tide could reach.
We ran it through our hands,
That piteous beauty grain;
We smelled the sweets of dripping clematis
Cliff hung, blent with salt ocean’s kiss;
But always watched the angry rain
Black beating on the water lands.
Bees on desolate meadows, blind with quest,
Leapt, vanished, leapt again in cold unrest.
From ashen and grief-grey skies
On to an iron sea
Fell little globes and rods of crystal life—
Two waters clashed and sprang away in
strife.
Each raindrop briny powers antagonise,
Recoiled, a buzzing bee.
We wondered who might taste
The poison honey stored
By those most swift and ill foreshowing flecks
Of ebony, see their hopes part into wrecks,
And love’s delight laid waste
By some insidious stinging horde.
Dark bees, still unforgot!
That day, faint felt, although we guessed
it not,
In shuddering throes drew its first breath
Estrangement, bitterer for us than death.

To One Unseen.
Be not too beautiful
With fairy gleams.
Nor be, O dream’s desire,
Too like my dreams.
Glide not, a ghost of flame,
From some wan star,
With gaze that seeks a goal
For ever far,
When that you come to me;
But may your eyes
Hold human wonderment,
A child’s surmise!
So be not like my dreams,
When you come true:
For dreams are like to death,
And life is you!
Nor walk, as dreams are wont,
Gossamer-shod,
But with worn sandals tread
Where all have trod.
We follow far who seek
A phantom bliss;
Over our haunted sleep,
If sleep it is,
La Belle Dame Sans Merei
Laughs, throned above;
Be you more pitiful,
And bring me love.
For bitter wisdom mocks
My heart with this :
Not all our dreams are worth
One happy kiss!

AS WE SAID BEFORE
This Page will be devoted week by week to reproductions of the
gems in picture, story and verse published in “The Bulletin of last
century, so that pleasant memories may be revived in old readers and
anew generation may enjoy the things that delighted an earlier one.
Tlie she-cricketer is a strange and aggres-
sive sight. I [Sappho Smith] was much
entertained by the spectacle of “N.S.W. v.
Victoria.” visible on Sydney Association
DAVID SYME, OF THE “AGE.”
Ground last week. They were all attired in
cream flannel skirts, very saggy about th.e
hems, and blouse bodices, Victoria choosing
dark blue ribbons and white duck hats, while
N.S.W. had pale blue bands round their
small “sailors,” from beneath which their
sun-kissed noses gleamed with a gleam like
unto boiled beet, and each team had dark
blue hosen with the garters fastening above
the knee as I had frequent opportunity to
observe, and generous feet, and put on more
“dog” than Spofforth ever did. They were
a very stagey lot of darlings, too, and one
round-arm bowler’s “business” ere she sent
the leather at her adversary’s head was
bewitching—once she seemed to wink witn
her right tan shoe, which went up whenever
she raised her right arm, and the rest \vas
a blur of scarlet undergear, while the umpire
looked another way. The batsladies, too,
whenever they didn’t hit the ball, went
through a sort of waltz with the willow, the
force of each mistaken slog turning them
completely round. As for _ the scouts, they
were simply scufflers. Cricket is a lovely
game for men, but no woman with a remnant
of vanity about her should play it.
An English clergyman wants to know if
the Australian kangaroo is utilised for dairy
purposes. This question reads curiously m
the great Australian cities which between
them now consume probably not less than
160,000 gallons of marsupial milk daily. 1 cr-
imps 70 per cent, of the Australian butter
exported to England is made from kangaroo
milk, which, though it was hardly used at all
during the first 50 years of Australian his-
tory, is by far richer and more palatable
than that from the cow.. The very best
qualities of Australian butter, however, are
produced from the milk of the bunyip, which
beautiful and docile animal is always milked
at night—generally by carefully trained
aboriginal servants, who for some as yet
unascertainable reason succeed in making it
yield 20 per cent, more milk than can be
extracted by white men. Bunyip milk gives
no less than 20 per cent, of cream, and is
thus more valuable than even goat’s milk.
A number of exuberant persons, male and
female, in a certain Melbourne suburb de-
cided to give a surprise party in the house
of a mutual friend. They arrived to find
that another surprise party had got in
ahead of them and was in possession of the
house. He was a bailiff. Some of them then
began to see that their visit might be con-
strued as an indelicate intrusion on the
privacy of domestic life, but two or three felt
the imbecility of their position so keenly
that they clubbed together and actually
bought out the bailiff and
held their party in the house
after all. Their host was
geniality personified, and en-
tertained them royally on
their own provisions and
liquor till dawn, with velvet
foot, came stealing o’er the
eastern hills and brought
the milkman whooping on
his rounds. It was only dis-
covered by accident a few
days afterwards that the
whole thing was a “plant.”
The impecunious one had
got wind of their intentions
and induced an acquaint-
ance, not known to any of
the party, to personify a
bailiff, which he did _ with
great success, as previously
stated.
John Cathie, of Ballarat
(Vic.), was the first under-
taker who sat in an Austra-
lian Parliament. When
Parliament opened, Cathie
put on his professional black
clothes and took his seat in
what he called the ’Ouse.
During the first pause in
the proceedings, he elevated
himself and excitedly blurt-
ed out that “it would be a
very good thing for the
country if the members and
supporters of the Govern-
ment were all dead.” Then
up rose Aspinall, with one
of his cynical smiles, and
retorted, “Good thing for
you, you mean; you might
get the job of burying them.” And then
Cathie fell back with the sigh of a man
who had just been rapped over the head with
the shinbone of a pirate’s corpse.
There was a lovely creature in the giddy
throng at a recent Melbourne ball, with a
dress that looked like a dream of summer
clouds, and a sort of patent bouncable india-
rubber bust, and a gold roof to her mouth,
and other expensive fittings, and for three
hours or so she had a high old time of it.
Then, alas! she came to grief. Her dress
was buttoned up behind, so tLe ardent ad-
mirer who presented her with a bouquet
about the size of a raspberry-tart had to
pin it to her bust. The next thing he was
aware of was a horrible wheeze from his
partner’s chest, and a current of blowing
in his face, and in about five seconds the
lady degenerated into a baggy thing of
ignominy, with an old, broken bird-cage
framework —a creature wdiose upper half
seemed to be roughly constructed of one
clean-picked bone, covered with ropes; and it
dawned upon him that the bust had burst.
BREAKING UP THE DROUGHT.
AQUARIUS (to Young Australia) : “Say when!”
AUSTRALIA: “Fill her right up, old man.”
She got away somehow —she never knew
exactly how, neither did he—but the people
in the flat below 7 her were disturbed by
sounds of dancing overhead, that continued to
a late hour, and when a lady at last went
up to remonstrate she. saw through the key-
hole a set of teeth in a glass of water, a
crushed bonnet, a pair of high-heeled boots,
and a female wdiose complexion was half-
washed off with tears, and who couldn't have
passed for 47 except at night with the light
behind her, attired in skimpy petticoats, and
dancing a fandango on the shapeless tatters
of what had once been a bust. The visitor,
who had come to holler, respected her tears
and old age, and silently stole away.
Two Carcoar (N.S.W.) girls made a bet
recently as to which would dress in the
quickest time. The winner did it in 5
hours 15 minutes 42 seconds.
It was at a swimming-bath. The exact
address doesn’t signify, because anybody who
wants to know can get it by applying to
the bath-keeper, and the date doesn’t matter
much. Also, the names of the parties con-
cerned are of no consequence. A thoughtful-
looking man in a blue bathing-suit had stood
looking at the waiter for about half an hour,
and at last he becKoned to the man who lent
out the costumes and gently said: “You
change the water pretty frequently, don’t
you?” “Twice a week; had it in clean this
morning. Any fault to find with the water?”
“Oh, dear no! Not at all, not at all! In
fact, all the arrangements are admirable.
But —er —when do you let it out next/
“Next Wednesday. Lost anything/ Well,
not exactly; no, I can’t say Ive tost: any-
thing” (here the man in the blue bathing-
suit "lowered his voice to a whisper) ; the
fact is, I was bathing with my wife s motliei
and I don’t seem to see her anywhere. Mie
was a stout woman in a black costume.
You haven’t seen her anywhere, have you.
The attendant said he had not. Well, l
-just remembered that I trod on something
soft down there at the deep end a wine
ago, and an idea struck me—- Let * see.
Wednesday, you said. I think 111 drop
round then, if you don’t mind. Of course,
it isn’t of any particular consequence, but
I may as well look in. Tliauks; good
morning.”
An ideal wife —another fellow’s.
Theodore Emmond is charged in New
York, says a Dalziel cablegram to the Lon-
don press, with conspiracy and defamation
of character. He boarded with a _ Mrs.
Dusen, and, dissatisfied with the quality of
the food, placed a phonograph in the kitchen
and bribed the cook to set it going while
her mistress was talking. This she did, and
then Emmond set the phonograph talking
before the assembled boarders and Mrs.
Dusen: “Mary, you don’t want to pay over
S cents a pound for meat, anyhow. It’s
good enough for them. You can get it in
Mulberry-street for that. You are giving
too much for steak. If they don’t like it
let them eat more vegetables. Yesterday
you bought fresh pie: how often have I told
you to save 5 cents by getting it stale and
warming it up! Then this bill of 25 cents
a pound for coffee is too much; coffee at
15 cents a pound will do in the future. I
have got enough trouble to make both ends
meet without feeding three men at 8 dol-
lars a week on porter-house steak.” Mrs.
Dusen streaked for her lawyer without hear-
ing all. Case proceeding.
A woman who threw a bucket of water
over two lovers was fined £5 ,by a Sand-
hurst (Vie.) magistrate a while back —for
contempt of court, we presume.
THE LITERARY FRIEND.
Once I wrote a little poem which I thought
was very fine, . .
And I showed the printer’s copy to a critic
friend of mine.
First he praised the thing a little, then he
found a little fault;
"The ideas are good,” he muttered, “but the
rhythm seems to halt.”
So I straightened up the rhythm where he
marked it with liis pen,
And I copied it and showed it to my clever
friend again.
"You’ve improved the metre greatly, but the
rhymes are bad,” he said,
As he read it slowly, scratching surplus
Wisdom from his head.
So I worked as lie suggested (I believe in
taking time),
And I burnt the midnight taper while I
straightened up the rhyme.
“It is better now,” lie muttered; “you go
on and you’ll succeed ;
It has got a ring about it—the ideas are
what you need.”
So I worked for hours upon it (I go on when
I commence),
And I kept in view the rhythm and the
jingle and the sense;
And I copied it and took it to my solemn
friend once more,
But it ’minded him of something he had
somewhere read before.
Now the people say I’d never put such
horrors into print
If I wasn’t too conceited to accept a friendly
hint,
And my dearest friends are certain that I’d
profit in the end
If I’d always show my copy to a literary
friend.

Grey Hair is always taken to be a sign
of age or worry, and in a woman, especi-
ally if she be in early years, amounts to
a tragedy. A woman should never let
herself go. The signs of youth should
always be protected. The well-known
preparation, Dr. Allen’s Mexican Walnut
Stain, removes all trace of grey. It is
easy and safe to apply and can be done
in the privacy of the home.

JOHN CRISP
TELLS THIS DELIGHTFUL STORY OF THE INNOCENCE
OF AUNTY.
!’VE seen some crook stuff done during me
sixteen years’ ridin’. Plenty o’ times I’ve
’ad it shoved up to me, by punters as
well as the books. I could’ve put a lot o’
money in me kick by pullin’ ’orses when
me instructions was to win, an’ it’s a
shame what I could’ve made by winnin’
when me instructions was to run a bye.
But I never listened to ’em either way. I
never forgot what me old mother told me
the day 1 ’ad me first mount. “Tim,” she
said, “don’t ever forget, Honesty’s the best
policy.” That’s always a great sayin’ of
’ers. “Always,” she said, “obey your in-
structions.” It’ll show you ’ow I stuck to
’er advice when I tell you that not once
have I ever been disqualified on me own;
the owner or trainer, or both, has always
been put up with me. That’s ’ow it is, I’m
trusted by everybody in the game.
But the ’ottest thing I ever ’ad put over
me was once in the bush. I suppose you
think it funny me ridin’ at a bush mectin’?
Well, it was years ago, an’ I went to Bulla-
wop to ride a ’orse for me aunty, Sarah
Macslaver. An’, ever since, what I always
say is, that every young ’orseman ought to
try an’ get bush ridin’ experience. I learnt
more in two days’ ridin’ at Bullawop than
Sydney an’ Melbourne learnt me in five
years.
Well, it was this way. Me Aunty Sarah
an’ me mother was sisters, but me mother
’adn’t ’eard from ’er for donkey’s years. All
of a sudden. me mother gets a letter from
’er sayin’ I ought to spend a ’oliday on ’er
farm, an’ sayin’ she’d ’eard I was a cornin’
jockey an’ a straightgoer, an’ she’d like to
see me, especially if I could get there for
the Bullawop races to ride a ’orse what she
'ad nominated for the Cup on the first day
an’ the ’Andicap on the second. _ An’ she
finished up by sayin’ she didn’t ’old with
racin’, because there was _ so much crook
stuff in it, but she was anxious to show the
people of Bullawop that racin’ could be a
clean sport, if only clean people was in it.
Well, me old mother was terrible pleased.
“The change’ll do you a world o’ good,
Tim,” she says, “but for mercy sake,” she
says, “watch your P’s an’ Q’s. Your Aunty
Sarah is a terrible religious woman —a lone
widow, what thinks of nothin’ else but
slavin’ on the farm an’ makin’ ends meet.
An’ don’t whatever you do take your battery
with you,” she says.
Me aunty turned out to be even a bigger
woman than me mother, but not so old. _ 1
couldn’t make ’er out for a bit. She ’ad
me bluffed; the way she looked down at me,
as if she was goin’ to search me. She an’
Joe, the bloke that worked former, met me
at the station. When she saw me she put
up ’er ’ands an’ said, “Good gracious, Tim !
What an awful little rat you are!” Then
out loud to Joe, “Fancy a sister of mine
’avin a child like that!” Then she turns ’er
eyes up, an’ says: to ’erself like, “God’s will
be done.” She was a terrible goody-good,
readin’ out o’ the Bible every night an’
prayin’ out loud. When we was ’avin our
scran she most always talked about money,
sayin’ ’ow ’ard it was to get, an’ ’ow thank-
ful we ought to be to Him that we could
work ’ard an’ wasn’t cripples.
At daylight the mornin’ after I arrived
she gets me out o’ bed, an’ shows me the
'orse, an’ a good-lookin’ big bay he was, an’
she tells me she picked ’im up cheap from a
milkman wot went broke. The milkman, she
said, ’ad drove ’im for a couple o’ years
on ’is milk round. He told ’er the ’orse was
terrible well-bred, was only five years, but
’ad never been raced because he’d got tan-
gled up in a fence when he was a foal.
What gets me is the way he is lookin’ —
coat like silk —till Aunty explains that Joe,
who ’as been preparin’ ’im for the Cup,
knows the job, havin’ been brought up to
the game by ’is old man, who was a well
known trainer out back. Then Joe ’ops ’is
frame in, an’ saddles ’im up, an’ we go
out to the big paddock to try ’im out.
Joe rides ’im for a start an’ lie moves
like a racehorse. Then I stretches im out
for six furlongs, an’ he surprises me. By
the end of a week he was jumpin’ out of ’is
skin an’ the Cup was in two days’ time.
The distance was a mile an’ a quarter, but
two miles wouldn’t trouble ’im. He was a
true stayer all right. I was satisfied that
whatever beat Amen would win. Joe, know-
in’ most o’ the other starters, said he was a
cert barrin’ accidents.
Funny name. Amen, wasn’t it? It’s out
o’ the Bible. Me aunty asked Joe to think
of a good name for the ’orse, but said it must
be out o’ the Bible, an’ Joe says he only
knows one name out o’ the Bible —Amen.
An’ me aunty said, “So be it.” An’ that’s
what he was registered.
Well, me aunty ’ad a terrible set on bet-
tin’. She used to say to me at nights, after
leadin’ the Bible an’ prayin’ out loud,
“Tim,” she’d say, lookin’ at me very 'ard
like, “I do ’ope you’ll never take to gamblin'.
You ought to,” she’d say, “pray mornin’ an"
night, connected as you are with racin’, that
you might never be tempted to bet on the
"orses.” An' though I kept tellin’ ’er -what
a straightgoer I was, she always put me in
the long shut-eye prayer every night.
Well, a couple o' days before the races,
Aunty says to me, “Tim, the Cup is worth a
'undred pounds, an’ the ’Andicap seventy-
five pounds, an’ I can’t ’elp thinkin’ what
a lift it would be for a poor woman like
me if Amen could win those races, or even
one of them.” An’ then she asked me what
I really thought of ’is chance, an’ when I
said I thought we was ’ome an’ dried, she
said, “Well, that settles it. I must go into
Bullawop first thing to-morrow mornin’, an’
tell the editor of the paper what we think of
Amen, so’s he can publish it, an’ give the
poor souls that bet a chance to get on to the
right ’orse.” Well, I couldn’t say nothin’,
but I was wishin’ I could get to a bookmaker
before she got to the paper, as I intended
‘avin’ a bob or two on Amen, which wasn’t
goin’ against Aunty’s prayers, because it
ain’t gamblin’ if you can’t lose. Well,
Aunty put it in the paper all right, an’
I didn’t get a chance for a bet till we was
on the course, an’ finds that Amen’s a j
hot favorite for the Cup. As early as I could
I gets a quiet word with the leadin’ bookie
of Bullawop. He’s a local hairdresser an’
tobacconist an’ runs a big billiard saloon as
well, an’ does all the big bettin’ for the dis-
trict. A great big bloke he was with a ter-
rible loud voice, an’ they said he thought
nothin’ of holdin’ three or four thousand
quid on one race. The best I could get was
three to one, so I takes sixty to twenty, all
the money I ’ad with me, an’ I didn’t do so
bad, as Amen started at evens.
Well, strike me dead, it's a shame what
a good thing Amen was in that race. There
was only one ’orse that could’ve paced it
with ’im—a black thing called Night Owl, a
stranger to the districk —but I could see
the way ’is rider was ’andlin’ ’im he wasn’t
’avin’ a go. I strikes a good possie, an’ 1
’olds ’im there, an’ waits me chance. An’
let me tell you he took some ’oldin’. ’ls
mouth was ’ardcr than goats’ knees. At the
six furlongs post me chance comes, with an
openin’ on the rails. We leave the mob an
turn into the straight with a good lead, an’
a licll-for-leather pace on. He looks a
winner all over. Then out o’ the corner o
me eye I sees the big bookmaker with ’is
bag on rush up to the rail in front ot'
me, an’ just as the ’orse’s ’ead is level with
’im he yells “Milk-o!” An’-—strike me pink
—the next thing I know the ’orse ’as stopped
gallopin’, ’is front feet is slidin’ on the
grass, an’ I’m sittin’ on ’is neck. The
wonder is we don’t bring the field down,
but they keep clear, an’ a twenty to one
chance wins. Now what do you know about
that?
Hidin’ back to the paddock Im all in, an
terrible down-’earted, more for me poor
aunty’s sake than me own, though I’ve done
me roll. While me an’ Joe rubs 'im down
an’ rugs ’im up, the mob’s all round us,
lookin’ down in the mouth, an’ very quiet.
But I can see they don’t blame me. Knowin
I. suppose what a straightgoer I was.
When I gets a word with me aunty, I’m
surprised to find what a good sport she was.
I tells ’er what ’appened.
But she won’t ’ave it that ther big bookie
ca«lled “Milk-o!” to stop the ’orse. _
“Listen, Aunty,” I says, “that big stiff
’as found out about Amen bein’ in a milk
cart, a*n’ if Amen loses it’s worth 'undreds o’
quids to ’im, an’ he knows the ’orse’s been
educated to stop if anyone yells “Milk-o!”
So what does he do”
“Nonsense, Tim Toon,” Aunty comes back,
throwin’ ’er ’ead in the air, an’ lookin’ as if
she might get off ’er bike, “whoever ’card of
such a thing?” she snaps. “I’d never believe,”
she goes on, “that any man in this districk
would do the likes of tha<t.” Then she calms
down, an’ puts ’er ’and on me shoulder, an’
gives me the oil about meself. “Tim,” she
says, sorrowful, like, “your racin’ career an’
the company you’ve kept ’as rooned your
faith in ’uman nature.” Then she puts ’er
’and to ’er eyes, an’ says, “Let’s bow_ our
’eads to the will of ’Raven. It wasn't to
be, Tim, that I should ’ave the stake.”
Well, I felt terrible sorry for me poor
aunty, so I made up me mind I’d do ’er a
good turn next day. unbeknownst to ’er. 1
could see that me aunty was too iunercent
to ’old ’er own against the racin’ mob. So
I says to meself. “Tim, this is where you
take the law into your own ’ands, an’ pulls
your old aunt out o’ the mud.” I don’t go
’ome with Aunty that night, because I ’ave
to stay in Bullawop to look after the ’orse.
While I‘m ’avin tea on me own I chews over
the position. I gets this: if Amen wins the
’Andioap Aunty wins seventy-five quid, an'
I win nothin’ because I got nothin’ to back
’im with, an’ I’m losin’ twenty quid. But with
a good ’orse like Amen losin’ the ’Andicap,
there ought to be a bit more than seventy-five
in it for Aunty an’ a little wad for me. Now
I’m satisfied that Amen, if he wasn’t inter-
fered with by milk-cart talk, was too classy
for anything in the Cup barrin’ Night Owl,
the black ’orse that ran the bye. An’ no
’orse was startin’ in the ’Andicap that didn’t
run in the Cup. So I finishes me tea an’
looks up the connections of Night Owl.
They’re father an’ son an’ don’t belong to
the districk. The old man’s the owner an’
trainer an’ the son does the rulin’. You’ve
only got to look at the old bloke with ’alf
an eye to see that he’s a take, an’ when
he starts maggin’ you find out that the small
stuff’s no good to ’im. They was terrible
glad I looked ’em up. They said they was
set to pick up a poultice on the ’Andicap, it'
they could get Amen, the only ’orse they
was frightened of, in the bag. They reckoned
I pulled Amen up in the Cup, an’ I lets them
think so.
Well, we gets down to business, an’ it’s
agreed that Amen should ’elp Night Owl to
win the ’Andicap, an’ if it came off the
old man was to pay me .on the course five
hundred quid. Then they tell me what they
want. “All you’ve got to do,” said the old
man, “is this. At the fall o’ the flag, go
for the lick o’ your life, an’ break up the
field, an’ when they’re strung out Night Owl
will go through ’em. That’ll prevent,” he
says, “any chance of our ’orse gettin’ jambed,
or any rough stuff they might try to pull on
us. They’re a dirty lot of cows round ’ere,”
lie says. “Then,” he went on, “you steady
your mount along the ba*ck stretch, an’
Night Owl w r ill go up to you. Then you can
pace him to the top o’ the straight, where
lie’ll leave you.” The old man gives a low
laugh, claps me on the shoulder, an’ says,
“How’s that?” An’ I says, “It’ll do me.”
■Well, I couldn’t ’elp thinkin’ I was bein’
a real ’elp to me poor aunty, an’ as I’ve
always been a straightgoer, I makes up me
mind I’d split the five ’undred with ’er —
fifty-fifty. Two ’undred an’ fifty quid, I
thinks, ought to be a small fortune for ’er
the way she is.
Well, ’ow did we get on? ’Struth, don’t
ask me! The goin’ was good till we gets
into the straight. I broke up the field all

right, an’ Night Owl gets through an’ comes
up to me at the top o’ the straight, but
I feels he can’t pass me. Amen’s in great
nick an’ terrible determined. But I wasn’t
worryin’. AH I ’ad to do to stop ’im was
to shout “Milk-o.” I takes a quiet pull at
’im, an’ he shoots ’is ’ead out an’ nearly
pulls me out o’ the saddle. Night Owl’s
all out, an’ ’is rider’s roarin’ at me to take
a pull. I gives it another go. But ’is neck
is stretched right out, an’ I’ve got no ’ope
that way. So I says to mcself, “ ’Ere goes,’’
an’ I yells “Milk-o!”
The words ain’t out o’ me mouth before
the big bookmaker leans over the rail an’
yells in the ’orse’s ear, “Nothin’ to-day.”
With that the ’orse starts to unwind a
gallop I never knew was in ’im. Night
Owl can’t stay with ’im, an’ I’m just about
all in. There’s less than a furlong to go.
I'm game, an’ ’angin’ on to ’im with all
I’ve got left. Night Owl comes again. He’s
within ’alf a ’ead of Amen. I gets enough
breath to let go another yell, “Milk-o!” An’
blast me if a woman on the rails doesn’t
scream “Nothin’ to-day!” an’ Amen bounds
past the post with nothin’ in front of ’im.
“That’s put the lid on it,” I kept sayin’
to meself as the clerk o’ the course escorts
me to the judge’s box. I’m wonderin’ what
Night Owl’s connections’ll want to do to me,
and what I’ll say to them. An’ I’m feelin’
the loss of two ’undred an’ fifty quid some-
thin’ terrible. But I try to keep me mind
on the one bright spot—Aunty won’t be
able to thank me enough for winnin’ ’er
seventy-five o’ the best. So I dress quick
an’ ’urry out to find ’er.
I don’t 'ave to look far. She’s waitin’
for me at the door o’ the dressing-room.
’Er face is like a meataxe, an’ she’s mutterin’
to ’erself an’ ’oldin’ ’er umbrella by the
middle. I don’t ’ave time to wonder why.
She reaches out for me. Gets ’er fingers in
me shirt-collar an’ shakes the knob of ’er
iimbrella in me face, an’ spits at mo, “You
little crook, I oughter break every bone in
your body, tryin’ to rob a poor widow, an’
your aunt an’ all!”
At last I manages to jerk out, “What’s
the matter with you? I won, didn’t I?”
“You won, you pasty-faced brat!” she
snaps. “Nothin’ o’ the kind! You tried
to stop ’im yellin’ ‘Milk-o!’ a*n’ would ’ave
only for me an’ Jim shoutin’ ‘Nothin’ to-
day.’ You nearly cost us the best part of
a thousand pounds, you little blackguard.”
Well, I can’t make nothin’ of ’er, so I lets
'er go on, an’ after a bit she calms down.
Then I think it best to tell ’er ’ow I tried
to get ’er two ’undred an’ fifty quid. That
seems to get ’er all right. She laughs like
anything an’ says, “Well, well, I suppose
you was-actin’ for the best, accordin’ to your
lights. But what a ninny you are!” she
says. “Don’t you know that if Night Owl
’ad won,” she asks, “you’d ’ave got notnin’?”
“ ’Ow do you make that Qut?”— — I
began.
“Stop talkin’,” she says, “an’ listen. I
found out all about Night Owl an’ ’is con-
nections, an’ I gave the facts to the stewards.
Night Owl was a ring-in. He’s been dis-
qualified, an’ your friend the owner is in
the lock-up. What Jim an’ me was fright-
ened of,” she goes on, “was the favorite.
He was third, an’ runnin’ on at the finish,
an’ you, monkeyin’ with Amen, might ’ave
let ’im win.”
Well, I thinks that the win, maybe, ’as
turned Aunty’s ’ead, au’ it wasn’t till we
was drivin’ ’ome in the evenin’ that I got
the strong of ’er. When we was clear o’
the racecourse I says to ’er, “Aunty, who
is Jim? An’ ’ow do you make out that if
Amen lost it would ’ave cost you nearly a
thousand quid?”
For a start she said nothin’, but ’anded
me the reins, lookin’ at me with that funny
way of ’ers. She opens ’er bag, takes out
a ’andful of notes, counts out twenty, an’
’aiids them to me, sayin’, “That’s yours,
Tim, from Jim. That’s the twenty pounds
you put on Amen in the Cup unbeknownst
to me.”
Things was movin’ a bit fast for me, so
I don’t say nothin’, an’ Aunty carries on.
“.Tim,” she says, “is the big bookmaker, an’
.Tim an’ me is engaged to be married. We
been engaged a long time. Ever since he
’ad the milk-run. We’d ’ave been married
long ago but he wouldn’t stop puntin’ on
’orses, an’ I refused to marry ’im till he
did. Well, he rooned ’isself with ’is bettiu’,
an’ at the sale of ’is place I buys up a lot
o’ stuff, includin’ the ’orse Amen. Watch
where you’re goin’,” she breaks off, an’ tugs
at the rein to get the trap out o’ a ditch—
I forgot I was drivin’.
“After that,” she went on, “I takes Jim
in ’and. I was determined to cure ’im of
’is vice. An’ I did. I did it by makin’
’im a bookmaker. In other words,” she said,
“I made a taker, out of a giver. The book
that Jim makes is his an’ mine. Of course,
I ’ave the biggest share, because I find the
money. (You’ll be into that fence in a
minute,” she calls out, givin’ the reins an-
other tug.) “An’ I’m glad to say,” she smiles,
“that since I set ’im up Jim ’as never
again taken to the broad road that
leads to destruction. He’s never put
a penny on a ’orse. The result is we’re
doin’ well. What I makes on the farm Jim
trebles with the book, an’ if we’re spared
next Easter will see us married. Now,
Tim,” she finishes, “is there anything else
you’d like to know?”
“What’s the strong o’ you, Aunty?” I
asks, “wantin’ Amen to win the Cup when
he was favorite?”
Aunty gives a gurgle an’ says, “If you
remember it was me that made ’im favorite
through the local paper; but that doesn’t
mean I wanted ’im to win. I knew he
wouldn’t. Jim would attend to that. That's
is job. Favorites don’t win if Jim can ’elp
Business is business.”
“Then you must ’ave ’ad a good win over
the Cup,” I says.
“More than a thousand,” she says, quiet
like.
“An’ the ’Andicap to-day?” I asks.
‘ I don’t know yet,” she says, “but it will
be a fair bit Amen started at twenty-fives
to-day, but Jim was ’oldin’ only five pounds
ot it. So now you can see why I was angry
with you for interferin’ with our business
by draggin in that low-down crook stuff you
learned in town.”
At that the ’orse throws up ’is ’ead an’
snorts. An’ I looks at ’im an’ says to meself,
Im a bit with you there.”
The Waggon Wheel.
WILLIAM SEBBENS’S
TALE OF THE BIG TIMBER.
WHEN I topped the hill that overlooked
the little home, my spirits dropped.
There was a simple peace and con-
tentment about everything that made my
mission hurt more than ever. Birds whistled
merrily as they rustled in the fragrant
wattle-.blooms around mo; bees hummed a
drowsy chorus; and from some distant gully
came the tinkle of a cowbell. Through it
all I was carrying a message of worse than
sadness to the little, old-fashioned, unpainted
cottage nestling peacefully by the roadside.
I felt like a criminal as I opened the broken
gate and hesitatingly crept along the path to
the verandah, where honeysuckle and rose-
blooms breathed their fragrance. A sweet-
faced, white-haired old mother answered my
knock and I broke up completely.
“‘Could I have a glass of milk, please?” I
managed to stammer.
“Of course, lad ; come right through. It’s
a thirsty day, sure enough.” The welcome in
her motherly voice cleared my flustered mind,
and I followed her into the kitchen, where
she filled a glass with creamy milk and
handed it to me. “Take a seat and drink it
up. There’s plenty more.”
* It gave me time to control myself, though
I doubted now whether I would ever raise
sufficient courage to tell her the true pur-
pose of my visit.
“Don’t you feel lonely here, Ma’am?” I
asked as I sipped the milk.
“No, lad. We Dennings have learnt not
to be lonely. When father was killed me an’
mother lived for months in a bark humpy
miles from anyone. An’ when my husband
was killed I reared our only son here alone.”
“Your husband and father were both
killed?” I repeated almost unthinkingly.
“Yes, the waggon wheel got ’em both,
The brake broke with father down on the
coast when he was drawin’ sleepers an’ the
wheel runned over ’iin. An’ my husband”—
she paused to let her misty eyes wander to
the distant wattle-clad hills—“was capght up
there. The wheel crushed ’im against a
blue-gum.”
“And your son—where is he?” I was
curious to know if she had guessed the
truth.
Her eyes softened and filled with tears, but
through all shone a light that was unmis-
takably pride.
“He went over to France with the boys
in ’16,” she said slowly. “He died for his
country; an’ somehow I’m glad, for I was
always afeard the wheel would get ’im too.”
t- * * *
, I said good-bye, and left her standing on
the verandah, where the scented honeysuckle
and rose-blooms grew, a lonely contented old
soul. And as I rode off down the road my mind
wandered back to that scene in the big
bush of Gippsland. Once more I was dragging
the broken body of my mate from under the
wheel of a wrecked waggon. In feeble voice
and rambling words he was telling me of a
war he had shirked ; of faked papers and a
changed name; of a mother he wanted to send
a message to. He died with my promise to
tell her everything. Now, as I rode down the
road, I realised I had broken that promise;
but when I topped the hill and looked back
on the little old-fashioned cottage bv the
roadside, I was glad,
The Soldier Farmer.
Clouds piled in the hot blue sky,
Sudden thunder rumbling;
Warm rain, and the clods long baked and
ary
Now soaked and crumbling.
The dusty trees washed green,
With big drops dripping under,
In the long silences between
The peals of thunder.
Over the soldier’s farm
The storm rolls with a roar;
And a brown man leans 'on his sunburned
arm ■
__And stares from the homestead door.
\\ hat vision does he see
T Of Flanders far away
Where a thousand graves of years to be
Were filled in a day?
O firey skies suddenly dark!
Destruction falling like rain
On upturned faces of men! O hark —
The guns again!

Morning Joy.
As I went idly wandering
By fields of tasselled corn,
I heard a magpie lifting up
A song of joy at morn.
To me it seemed, charmed by that song,
As on and on I strayed,
Harp, violin or troubadour
Such music never made.
I visioned dewdrop, flower and pearl,
And gold without alloy,
As through my soul it thrilled and throbbed,
That song of morning joy.
And then and there, so rapt was I,
This thought awoke in me—
Could I but steal that magpie’s strain
A happy thief I’d be!
Could I but make his joyance mine,
Like him untroubled sing,
All round and round the rolling world
I’d go a-carolling.
And all who hearkened to my song
Would feel the joy of morn,
And hear alone a. bird that sang
O’er fields of tasselled corn!

Famous People-
l
and a Famous Medicine
\
Cream of Yeast is a genuine way to better
Health—the remedy chosen by famous
people who dare not let headaches, a bad
nerves” and dull complexions take their toll.
Cream of Yeast is a product of chemical skill and
great resources; it is improbable that, for average
needs, a more beneficial medicinal tablet could be
made ; it is certain that this remedy gives satisfaction
to the public; it is a positive fad that it is safe.
Take Cream of Yeast when tired and depressed. Take
it for aches and pains, « nervy spells,” sour stomach,
listlessness and dull complexion. Do not suppose
plain brewers’ yeast can give the same benefits. Re-
member: this remedy is a medicinal yeast-compound,
costing more to make than plain yeast tablets, yet
costing you no more. Your money back if the very first
bottle of Cream of Tea® doesn't do you a 'world of good l
en
In an interview in one of the greatest newspapers in the
world, Dr. Victor Pauchet* a leading French Physician,
Commander of the Legion of Honour, recipient of the
Croix de Guerre, recommends Yeast as a remedy for
intestinal stagnation. He says “ Yeast ... is a food
rich in Vitamin B and increases vitality. It is thus a boon
to the health of humanity.”
In a London interview reported in another great news-
paper, Dr. Leonard Williams, Fellow of the Royal Society
of Medicine, educated in England, Scotland, France and
Germany, and well-known author of several books on
He..lth, said “ I frequently see people who, though they
claim to be well, are nevertheless much below concert pitch.
