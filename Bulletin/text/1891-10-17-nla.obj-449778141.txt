conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guarantee a ferment and Complete Cure in every case I undertake,
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great

THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR, KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,

“Thrift.”
Somewhere about eighteen and a half cen-
turies ago a great Asiatic reformer and
philosopher arose in Syria and floored the
human race with the statement that a man
with property was not necessarily any better
than a man without. In fact, he distinctly
intimated that the probabilities all tended
the other way, and throughout his whole
career all his blessings and his promises were
for the poor, and all his anathemas were
directed against the rich. Ho has now some
350,000,000 followers, and except, possibly,
some two or three dozen, mostly in gaol,
they are all bogus. For the Christian world
still sticks to the great worldly axiom that
property is the one criterion of merit, and
never, under any possible combination of
circumstances, does it act up to its alleged
spiritual creed. There is no real democracy
in any yet explored region of the earth -
what is called a democracy only deserves the
name because it is a shade more democratic
than an aristocracy. There is no church
which does not snuffle lifty-two times per
annum about the blessings of being poor,
and yet almost every one of them will holler
for the police if an unshod vagrant—the
living symbol of the blessed state of poverty
appears within its doors. There is no
modern social reformer who will not
admit that all men are born equal, and
if there is one who will act up to
the creed in its entirety his name is
not known and his address is unavailable.
The worship of property, in some shape or
other, has grown with a thousand centuries
of grovel, until it has become an instinct, or
a disease. Possibly it is an incurable com-
plaint, and if so the Christian faith is a
failure and an impossibility, and had better
be given up.

In Melbourne, a few days ago, the old
trouble broke oflt afresh. The so-called
“Country Party” held a meeting to con-
sider the Bill for the abolition of plural
voting, or, in other words, for the abolition
of a certain form of outward and visible
grovel to the god of Property, It is a
measure which recognises that—in one
sense at least—all men are born equal, and
therefore it proposes to grant to all native-
born or naturalised adult male citizens an
equal share of political power. It is not
supposed, even by its most ardent sup-
porters, that the Bill will lead to the
extinction of the oldest and most enduring
of all superstitions. The belief that
property is the one thing worthy of respect,
and that religion, genius, patriotism, and
everything else that the world whoops for so
much in theory, are of small account com-
pared to the dignity of being a fat ignoramus
with a wilderness of bricks and mortar, will
remain as fresh as ever. The individual
who owns a house will glare with
the same bilious green eye as hereto-
fore at the individual who doesn’t
own a house ; and the person who has two
houses will look down on the person who
hasn’t any boots with the same loathing and
scorn as the feudal dignitary of old looked
down on the unconsidered member of the
common herd. But the measure for the
abolition of plural voting is the expression of
a growing opinion that it is advisable to
smother these sentiments as much as possible,
and to grovel inwardly instead of outwardly;
and it is the symbol of a new conviction that
man shouldn’t grovel at all if he can help it.
In other terms, the old politician claimed
that it was right to abase himself before
wealth, and did it accordingly ; the new
politician does it also, but admits that it is
not right; and such measures as the one in
question are meant as an attempt on his
] art to chain himself up, and keep himself
from abasement by making such a pro-
cess unprofitable. Even the most ardent of
the Victorian democratic party will probably
pay sixty times as much reverence to the
owner of Rupertswood as to an equally
moral and intelligent individual who lives in
a wooden cottage in the goat-infested regions
of Collingwood ; but he will feel more demo-
cratic when he recollects that he can only
get one vote as his reward in either case.
* # *
But the Country Party broke down be*
neath the strain. About three years ago*
when the old and artful Duncan Gillies
introduced a Bill providing that all men
should be politically equal, it gave in its
adhesion to the new faith, and for many
weary months it hadn’t openly grovelled.
All that time it had struggled to look as if it
felt that property was not the one thing
needful, and that a man with a manure-heap
and a goat was not necessarily any more
worthy of respect than a man without them.
All that time it had hardly once used the old,
unctuous phrase about the person who had
1 ' a stake in the country.” And gradually it
came to feel as a Protestant might who had
been converted to Catholicism by violence,
and who at last began to realise that he must
curse the Pope or burst. It was filled Avith
the sensations of the opium-fiend who has
sworn off. The general election was ap-
proaching, and for the sake of its billet and
its honorarium it wanted to keep up the
democratic show ; but its craving for one
refreshing grovel was too much for it.
Therefore, it met in semi-secresy, and at the
instigation, apparently, of L L. Smith, the
individual who trades on the young man
who “ doesn’t feel well,” a resolution
was carried to the effect “that thrift
should be given representation ; ” and it was
further decided that everybody who paid
rates should have two votes, one for his
manhood and the other for the property on
which the rates are paid. By this proposed
arrangement some 20,000 voters will have
one suffrage each, and about 220,000 will
have two suffrages ; and for all practical
purposes it would amount to much the same
thing if everybody got two votes, or 16
votes, or 100, and everybody was credited
with a property qualification, and the
Country Party grovelled to everybody in
one act. The scheme is about the same as
that of dividing the adult male population
into 220,000 dukes and 20,000 common
people.
* * #
When it had fired off its old platitude once
more the party evidently felt better. It
wisely refrained from going into explana-
tions, and why thrift should have extra
representation was not expounded. The old
Conservative always whoops for this one
particular virtue, but he never ventures to
assert definitely that it is greater than any
other virtue. Thrift, after all, is only the
habit of accumulating coin, and is merely
another branch of the great virtue by which
a monkey accumulates nuts. It is the art
of shoving the ratepayer’s aged parent
in the benevolent asylum or the work-
house, and putting the money that would
otherwise be spent on the old man’s feed in
the bank. It is the science of wearing a
dirty shirt, and thus economising on the
wash-bill—the noble trait of sleeping fourteen
in a room and keeping down the rent—the
shining virtue of working and walloping a
weary, bony horse to death, and lending out
the profits of the animal’s misery on good
“ shecurity.” If the typical Conservative
were asked whether it was a better and a
grander thing to be a common money-
grubber and ultixxxately go to Sheol—
the Conservative is a hog on Sheol—or to
be a Christian of the apostolic pattern and
finally go to heaven —he is also a whale for
heaven—ho would answer unanimously and
at once that the latter was far preferable,
but he always proposes that the money-
grubber should have several votes, and never
once suggests that the genuine Christian
should have more than one. This shows
with sufficient distinctness that his Chris-
tianity is a lie, and that he might as well be
a Chinaman of the most aggravated type.
If he were asked whether it was better to
have the freehold of a mud hovel, or to be
a patriot of the order of Korner or Gari-
baldi or Bruce, he would undoubtedly
whoop for the patriot, but he never suggests
or dreams that a man who has done good
service to his country should have- extra
voting power, and that the gilded animal
who lias never served anybody save him-
self should not. This demonstrates that his
patriotism is also a lie of the choicest desci'ip-
tion. And he never by any chance moves
that the poet or the philanthropist or the
man of genius of any variety should have an
extra share of political power ; the only indi-
vidual in whom he takes any interest is the
one who has scraped money together, no
matter how he got it. And this proves that
the Tory is a grovelling lie altogether, from
his soul to his boots, and that the only thing
he values in all the earth is cash.
• * *
Possibly it may be that only a few
among the most retrogressive of Tories
venture even to think coherently that the
man who possesses property is necessarily
better or wiser, more moral, c r more
patriotic than the man who does not. To
put the idea into shape would be to give
the lie direct to Jesus Christ and all the
Apostles, to repudiate the whole theories of
the Churches, to jump upon and blast
Christianity in general ; and to go back on
the teachings of all the philosophers from
Diogenes and Moses down to Henry
George ; and even the common or garden
groveller seldom ventures therefore to for-
mulate his creed in words. Neither does he
ever venture to declare distinctly that the
one noble feature of the human race is the
desire to possess earth and bricks, and that
no other trait is worth preserving ; he in-
variably acts on that assumption, but he
never dares to state it in definite language.
It is a solemn thing to possess a political
faith that is too foul to be expounded
in comprehensible terms, but three-fourths
of civilised humanity travels, more or
less unconsciously, on such a creed, and
apparently will continue to do so in-
definitely. It was, perhaps, too much to
expect that the Victorian Country Party,
when it threw up its uncongenial billet as a
democratic body, would have honestly
stated its position, but it would have been a
pleasant and refreshing thing if it had done
so. Then, instead of laying down the axiom
“ that thrift should be given representa-
tion,” its resolution would have run thus :
We hereby resolve that the chief end of man is to own
ground and bricks, and, compared to this, honour,
honesty, religion, intelligence,’ industry, philanthropy
and everything else are of no account.
* # #
The peculiar system of plural voting pro-
posed by the Country Party would be, as
it happens, of no possible use to the cause
of Property. It would half-disfranchise
about 20,000 electors, but it would strike
equally at the itinerant shearer and the
bank-dude who lives in a boarding-house,
and the results would be about even. But
the 29 members who adopted the proposition
had to get off the hoary gag about the person
with a stake in the country once more, or
else burst from internal pressure. They
hadn’t found a chance to unroll the old
statement and look at it since they became
democrats in 1888, and the want of it
had been preying upon them ever
since. They felt like a dreadfully profane
individual who hadn’t been allowed to curse
for three years, or like a Hebrew who had
been shut up for thirty-six months along
with a hunk of pork. They knew that their
resolution couldn’t be carried in Parliament,
for the country would repudiate the principle
of it ; and that even if it was carried it w'ould
do no possible service. They knew that the
much-advertised person with the “stake”
aforesaid was an exploded sham, and was
merely another name for a person -who had
the money to bolt with and get out of the
way whenever his country wanted him.
They knew they were going back on their
creed, and risking their seats and their
honorariums. But they had sworn off
grovel for three years, and the tempta-
tion was too much. They wanted to hear the
sound of the old sacred drivel once more ;
they felt in throwing off their misfit demo-
cratic theories, like Mr. Silas VVegg, the
man with the wooden extremity, when, after
months of waiting, he found himself at last
in a position to rise up and curse Mr.
Boffin, and repudiate the whole of his
situation except the salary. It was a case
akin to that of the man who has been saved
for 40 years, and who goes on a drunk in his
last moments simply because he wants to
have some refreshing sin, and even with his
reward in sight he can’t keep saved any
longer. It was Booth in his old age
solemnly repudiating the big drum by which
he made his money, merely because he had
seen the implement so often that the sight
of it made him sick. And in a general way
it was a melancholy spectacle and a dire
mistake.
Parnell.
For. a nation which is on such intimate re-
ciprocal relations with the Most High that it
has made Him a functionary of the State, Eng-
land has received of late an unaccountably large
number of hard knocks. That bourgeois in
excelsis, Bookstall Smith, has died, while Glad-
stone is permitted to live on and gain in men-
tal breadth and physical strength with his
waxing years; the Heir-apparent, “instinct
with kingly virtues and inspired by the exalting
traditions of a great race,” vide Lord Salis-
bury, has been revealed as the commonest type
of spieler, and the Heir-apparent’s Heir-ap-
parent only passes from the penumbra of the
Clevelaud-street infancy to be again eclipsed by
another heinous scandal ; that incarnation of
the British spirit of heroic emprise, as Gamp-
bridge terms Stanley, turns out to be a mere
blundering filibuster on the multitudinous grab
incarnadine; the Tory party is only rescued from
instant annihilation by stealing the policy of its
opponents—-all these shocks of fickle fortune
have visited England during recent weeks, and,
as though they were not enough to afflict her,
Parnell has died inst in the very.nick of time
to bring Home Rule within a measurable dis-
tance.
* # #
“ Nothing became Parnell during In's life
like his leaving of it.” While he lived, the
consolidation of the two elements of the Irish
party was impossible. On the one hand were his
personal followers, the men who would not allow
a social slur to blot out an unexampled record
of patriotic achievement; on the other, the
tremendous alliance of the forces of bigotry
and of the rancorous tribe which brook no
eminence with those slaves of indifferentism
who infallibly join the side which can shriek
the loudest and longest. Between these two
sections reconciliation was impossible while
Parnell lived, and while they were divided
Home Rule was as from practical
politics in Britain as the question of the anti-
quity of the cave-men. Irish nationalism was
worse than dead while the feud of the two
parties was perpetuated, for it was a living
mortification and an animate corruption. It
is the curse of the Irish nature that it will
degrade the magnificent conception of a united
and independent Ireland to the level of a fac-
tion fight between the O’Tooles and the
O’Reillys. Parnell living was a victim, as
Grattan had been and O’Connell had been, to
that fatal tendency ; but Parnell dead will
awaken the sentimentalism which—a still more
powerful quality of the Hibernian character—
impels the Irish to adore their chieftains as
soon as the breath is out of their bodies.
Over and above their hatred of each other, each
of the two sides will now evidence that common
reverence for Parnell’s services and a common
remembrance of what every Irishman indivi-
dually, and the Irish people collectively, owe
to him. The centripetal impulse will be more
powerful than the centrifugal, and Parnell
will effect from his coffin the union which his
living personality was powerless to create.
This is why the rulers of England will say in
their hearts that the Uncrowned King should
have died hereafter. Parnellism is resurrected
with that Glasnevin burial,
* # *
’We discredit the rumour that Parnell com-
mitted suicide, and yet we should not be sur-
prised to learn that he had done so. His pre-
scient statesmanship may have shown him that
in spite of his measureless services to his people
he was the obstacle to their union, and conse-
quently a stumbling-block to the attainment of
his and their aims ; and he may have realised
that the highest statesmanship does not mani-
fest itself overtly and positively, but that the
most refined type of patriotic endeavour may
express itself in passivity, in abnegation, and
in withdrawal. Suicide, on this hypothesis,
would neither be cowardly nor treacherous.
It would be no admission of defeat. It would
be a fresh revelation of that sublime contempt
tor the precedented, and for the conventional
modes of leadership, w hich formed the secret of
his supremacy. Suicide would be but the
gathering together in one cynical, contempt uous
grasp the points of his adversaries’ spears so
that the men who followed him might break
through the opposing ranks to victory.
* # •
A dozen politicians and a hundred journalists,
who cannot penetrate the surface in a compari-
son, have called Parnell the greatest leader of
the Irish people since O’Connell. This
implies he was less than O’Connell, but the
comparison is crude, and therefore false.
Parnell was immeasurably the greater of the
two, for he inspired the people, while
O’Connell was inspired by them. The
Liberator was Catholic, he was racy of the soil,
he had that perfervidity of temperament and
recklessness of restraint both wdiolesome and
unwholesome, which are indubitably and char-
acteristically Celtic. Personally expansive, he
disguised mastership under bonhomie , and won,
by the subtle tentacles of personal magnetism,
hearts and minds that he could not draw to
himself by the grapnels of reason. Parnell
had none of these qualities. He w’as Irish,
but he was Protestant - Irish with an
English training, which had imparted to
him the priggish and repellant taciturnity of
the dominant race. Secretive, he was the
antipodes of O’Connell. His intimates got as
far into the’corridors of his mind as strangers
get into other men’s, ami he made even a
Dillon and an O’Brien feel the heel of his cold-
blooded autocracy. He was self-contained and
self-centred, while O’Connell’s genius w r as as
much reflected as original, and just by so much
as the original is greater than the derived was
Parnell greater than the Tribune of the Eman-
cipation era. O’Connell dreaded the House of
Commons while he insulted it. Parnell in-
sulted the Chamber and added a more vitriolic
poignancy to the sting of fiis insults because he
made it clear at ihe same time that he despise''
it. He took its rules and its procedure, the
cherished outer-fortifications of the Constitu-
tion, and from their shelter hurled his attacks
upon the Constitution itself.
* * #
Grattan, O’Connell, Shaw, Butt, had
fought in the Commons for Ireland on lines
of strategy and tactics laid down by their
foes. They had oftener received the attack
and acted on the defensive than the re-
verse. Parnell altered all that. To adopt
a phrase from Saint Beuve, avc may say that
he saw r no reason why simultaneously with
the defence of Rome, Carthage should not
be threatened. He safeguarded the prin-
ciples of nationalism while shocking and
outraging the British fetish, and he flouted
and heaped contumely on the hoary re-
positories of ideas dearest to British insu-
larity, while creating the new life in his
ow’n country. His predecessors in the leader-
ship thought they had exhausted inventive-
ness, when they had forged the weapons of
their agitation. It was left for Parnell to
steal the instruments he wielded from the
armoury of his people’s hereditary foe. There
was more merit in this—that the weapons he
used were foreign to the genius of his race.
O’Connell fought with things and tools that
the Irish had been accustomed to use generation
after generation. He employed satire and in-
vective and the turbulence of passion to arrest
British attention and to enlist Irish sympathy.
The young Parnell seized the forms in which


George Kebball, in a letter to an English
paper, give the following illustration of the abso-
lute reliability of circumstantial evidence :
My client was some years ago a passenger to the Cape,
and one day at dinner a fellow-passenger produced a very
old and valuable coin. It was handed round and suddenly
disappeared. Every effort to find it failing, it vas sug-
gested that all the passengers should turn out their
pockets. They did so with the exception of my client,
who declined, and for the (eniainder of the voyage he was
boycotted. Just as the vessel got into port the coin was
found in a remote corner of the saloon. My client had a
similar coin in his pocket all the while, but dared not say
so, as nobody would have believed him.
The furniture of ;i crofter named Mackay,
a tenant on the Duke of Sutherland’s estate, was
recently removed by a sheriff’s officer and placed
on a neighbour’s ground. The neighbour com-
plained, on which Mackay set it alight, saying
that it would make a better bonfire than any that
blazed for the marriage of the Duke and Duchess.
Maokay’s invalid sister managed to re-enter the
empty house, whereupon orders were given to null
down the building. No one in Urn parish would
do the job, and, though over a score of outsiders
were next offered, by a ducal official, £2 a man for
three hours’ work, these, too, all refused.
~ p fold flaccidity of the English nature moulded
.. gif to fight—and defeat—the English. Only
1 man of supreme powers could have educated
die English nation by demolishing its shrines,
id the Irish by ignoring its national qualities
id its illusions. To create a revolution on
a ' s ide of the Irish Channel by holding back
the revolution on the other this is what
p a rnell achieved.
* =& *
Parnell’s methods of work could, therefore,
not escape attracting to him the intense hatred
f England. Even the party which, as a matter
nf simple policy, allied itself with him, could
not help but hate him, for when he outraged the
national ideals he outraged their persons also.
W one believes that the Liberal acceptance of
Home Rule was due to a sincere conversion tothe
nistice of the cause ; it was a mere decision of
expediency, and was in itself a lamentable con-
fession of a defeat which rankled, and of a
humiliation with an immortal sting. Conse-
uently it was. only to be expected when the
inevitable woman cropped up that the moral
Philistinism of England should seize the oppor-
,unity for revenge. In the same instant it
coukl offer atonement to its outraged gods and
propitiate them with a further offering of smug
hypocrisy. The bourgeoisie saw its way to
regain its complacency of which it had been
deprived when Parnell stopped the car of
Empire, and the moral sense of a nation, which
can never approve an adultery that is not asso-
ciated with a peerage, rejoiced at the opening
for some more hysterical and salacious discus-
sion. The “ Nonconformist conscience,” which
is kept for use in the pocket of an advertising
journalist named Stead, too, appreciated the
opportunity for making a few sovereigns out of
Parnell’s moral smash, and was not de-
barred from the shameful huckstering by
the consideration that, a few months
before, when every material fact elicited
at the O’Shea trial was before the public,
it had declared itself convinced of Mr. Par-
nell’s “ perfect straightforwardness, truthful-
ness, and honour.” With these elements
arrayed against him, and with the Church that
had never liked Parnell but had only tolerated
Him —him, the heretic—though he were fighting
her battle as no son of her’s had ever done, also
forced by her creeds into an attitude of an-
tagonism, Parnell would have been more than
human could he have held his own. He had
committed the unpardonable sin of offend-
ing a religious body which, preaching for-
giveness, never forgives the man who breaks
its canons, and he had outraged the dense
stupidity of the British mind. However he might
despise "the antagonism he could not conquer
it, for there is infinite strength in incensed
littleness. The Gulliver of Irish unity was
held powerless in the meshes of the net woven
by a myriad Lilliputian malignities. Never-
theless, though Parnell is dead, Parnellism
was never so much alive as to-day. At least,
we would be justified in saying so without the
slightest hesitation were it not that in Ireland
everything happens except the foreseen. The
bias of the nation is always towards the inex-
plicable, and what Joubert said of France
could, with greater truth, be said of the poor
Cinderella of the nations : “ There are two
human natures, the general human nature and
the French.” A people which can stigmatise
John Dillon as a murderer of Parnell will do
anything in unreason.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bills Coming Due.
This year the final vestige and tail end of New
South Wales’ prosperity is vanishing over the
horizon. It is the last extremity of the great
financial drunk, before the Foreign-trade pro-
vince gets down to ashes, and hard fact, and
utter desolation. Practically, borrowing has
come to an end; or rather N.S. Wales must
still borrow vigorously, but almost all the
money that can be raised will be wanted to pay
off old loans, and none will be left for current
expenditure. For loans, like curses and over-
drafts, and valueless yellow dogs, and similar
things, always come back again ; they are a
mere shifting of the responsibility, and passing
along of the obligation, and an elaborate shunt-
ing of the trouble on to the next generation.
Every loan which the Parkes Government is
raising to-day is a liability shunted on to the
Treasurer of the future, and how he will pay it
when the bill falls due Heaven only knows ;
but, unluckily, while the Cabinet is thus affably
handing down its personal obligations to pos-
terity, regardless of consequences, the obliga-
tions which its Foreign-trade ancestors floated
—also regardless of consequences—are coming
heavily upon it. The trouble is only just
beginning, and already the position is nearly
desperate. A few weeks ago, in a serious
crisis, the country raised from the usurers
millions at a tremendous sacrifice, and with a
dead lift that nearly broke the back of every-
body concerned ; and of this enormous amount
all, save about £900,000, has gone to wipe out
old debts which had fallen due at an inoppor-
tune moment, and could be staved off no longer.
Yet within the next six or nine months or so
the Government has to pay £3,200,000 on
account of public works, therefore it must
raise at least millions more, or else
nle its schedule and become a ruined
shoddy enterprise. It is apparently hopeless
to dream of floating another huge loan at such
short notice ; yet without it the position is
utterly untenable, and even with it this second
crisis is only postponed for a few months, when
a third crisis will come on the scene. Next
year another old loan of £495,000 falls in, and
money must be borrowed to repay it, thus
raising the shortage to 22: millions. In 1893,
yet another ancient liability of £610,000 be-
comes due, and thus all the loan that is likely
to be raised that year will go to work off the
dead weight left over by the financiers of the
past. In 1894 and 1895 there is about £580,000
t 0 be paid off’; in 1896, an ancient national
note for £1,000,000 becomes due; in
rBJ/ and 1898, £1,800,000 must be borrowed to
meet two more I O U’s handed down by some
f ead and forgotten money grubber —in fact,
every year, up till 1912, there is a gigantic sum to
be raised, not as heretofore, to create a passing
boom and inaugurate a new period of national
prosperity, but merely to pay for the old dead
booms of thirty years ago —to liquidate the bill
for the riotous bursts of the buried generations.
A sum of £16,000,000 is about to fall due in
annual instalments, and when that is wiped off,
the province will enjoy three or four years of
well-earned repose, not because there are no
more liabilities, but because one or two wise
and far-seeing Treasurers shoved the day of
retribution a little further ahead. After this
breathing space is over, the old debts will start
falling due again at the rate of £3,000,000 to
£5,000,000 per annum. Therefore, the great
art and mystery of the period is not how to
borrow so as to keep the public works policy
afloat, and to maintain the ancient fiction that
Freetrade is a paying institution, but how
to borrow at any price to meet the bonds and
debentures with which that ruinous superstition
was shored up in the past. It is a solemn out-
look ; the country has had its drunk, and now
its only prospective joy is borrowing the money
to pay the bill, and then borrowing more money
to repay the money that was borrowed to pay
the bill, and so on ad infinitum through all
futurity. Therefore, as the Foreign-trade
Government has no way of creating a tem-
porary burst of prosperity except by borrowing,
it will probably back out at a comparatively
early date, and leave its shortage to the Pro-
tectionists to deal with ; and then it will stump
the country with a joyous disregard of facts
and dates, and claim that this £16,000,000 is a
Protectionist liability which arose backwards
through the nefarious influence of an unborn
tariff that cast its shadow behind it. And
probably the country will believe it. Past
experience seems to afford ground for the
opinion that New South Wales will believe
anything, so long as the hair of the man who
makes the assertion is long and white enough
and he doesn’t pay 20s. in the £.
Blundered to Death.
When the Fiji stranded off the Victorian
coast, the other day, the telegraphic instrument
at Port Campbell—the nearest telegraph-station
—was out of repair. It had, indeed, been
wrong for several days, the telegraph-
mistress, Mrs. Tbegea, being incompetent to
put it in working-order. Had that instrument
been 0.K., the steamer Casino, which was at
the very time lying at Port Fairy with steam
up, could have been at once despatched to the
Fiji’s assistance, and could have been relied
upon to reach her within three hours. Tbegea,
the husband of the telegraph-mistress, has
charge of the Port Campbell rocket-apparatus.
When he was informed that a wreck had
occurred 13 miles distant, he did not at once
start with these appliances, but lost precious
time in riding over first to look at the situation ;
then he returned home, loaded up the necessary
gear, and once more started for the ship. The
Gellibrand River punt-crossing is nine miles
from Port Campbell. Over this, owing to some
bungling, only half the life-saving plant was
taken on the first trip of the punt. __ A trap
awaited Tbegea on the other side, and he went
off straight away with only the rockets
and life-line, leaving the hawser and
cradle to follow. Arrived at the wreck, Tbegea
did not wait for the rest of the gear, but
started to send the life-line aboard. The line
was caught, on the second throw, by the hands
on the bowsprit, who, being under the delusion
that it was made fast to the expected hawser,
tried to haul it aboard. The men ashore held
on to the other end. This was interpreted by
the sailors to mean that the life-line was to be
their only chance, and so they made it fast.
The steward started along this scanty aid, but
soon let go his hold and sank. The second man
got ashore, the third was drowned, and so the
disastrous alternations continued—just one-
half being lost. The life-line got horribly
entangled with kelp, which hampered the men’s
efforts to escape. The hawser and cradle
arrived shortly after the first man saved had
reached the beach, but then there was no means
of making the men aboard understand that they
should haul on the life-line and secure these
more effectual appliances. When all the
tragedies were accomplished, a magisterial in-
quiry was held into the circumstance by—
whom, think you ? By Tbegea, J.P., the man
in charge of the life-saving apparatus himself.
And thereby hangs a tale. Eight years ago,
one Anderson was returned to the Victorian
Legislative Assembly as member for the district
in which these events happened. Mr. Tbegea
energetically canvassed for Andebson, and is
said to have secured for him every vote in the
locality. Not very long afterwards Tbegea
was appointed a J.P., and, later, the local
post-office was attached to his Port Campbell
store. He was then a widower, and afterwards
re-married. While yet in the full flush of his
newly-found bliss, a telegraph-line was con-
structed to Port Campbell, and a telegraph-
office opened there. Mrs. Tbegea was
appointed operator, and, knowing nothing of
the business, qualified herself by getting
tuition from a lady friend at Warrnambool.
But she is still ignorant on points of defects in
instruments, batteries, &c. Altogether a story
full of suggestions,
| a Revised Scripture Wanted.
A week or so ago the Manning River (N. S. W.)
Independent reprinted a very harmless alleged
Bulletin joke, and thereby it seems to have
irritated one Crane, the local devil-remover,
and made him boil over in his tabernacle.
Anyhow, the Independent publishes a brief
note, which was sent round to its office by the
bearer of good tidings, to this effect:
1 am sorry to ask you to discontinue sending the Inde-
pendent I wish to encourage every good movement and
institution, but 1 do not think the vulgarities and in-
decencies of The Bulletin good pabulum either for mind
or soul.
This is the leaden-headed fiend-shifter to the
life. To his narrow intelligence the mere fact
that a statement appears in The Bulletin is
conclusive proof that that statement is foul and
irreligious, and the mere fact that a statement
appears in the Bible is positive evidence that it
is a holy and sacred statement, and calculated
to elevate the soul; and that it should be
pasted up in every schoolroom and nursery
Yet that same Bible that good shepherd
Crane preaches from and whoops for
every Sunday, and which he urges his
audience to read unceasingly, and ponder over,
is chokeful of statements which couldn’t be
printed in The Bulletin without landing the
whole literary staff in gaol in short order.
And, in addition to that, the mere work of cor-
recting the proofs would put the staff off its
feed for a week, for the ancient prophets and
law-givers and the horrid old kings of Israel
were an exceedingly dirty race, who seemed to
have lived in an atmosphere of moral guano. If
Parson Crane will consider his Bible a little
more carefully he will probably come to the
conclusion that it would have been better for
that publication if some of The Bulletin staff
(we are a modest lot) had been on hand to
revise it when it first came out. And if this
particular sin-hunter has got the courage of his
opinions he is hereby invited to come down to
Sydney and read three chapters—which we will
select—of his own Scripture, in the English
language and in a loud and clear voice,
to a Sunday congregation of 1000 reason-
ably refined ladies and gentlemen who
fully understand that language; and if he
gets through without the congregation running
over him with their feet, or grinding his skull
on the doorstep, or hauling him through the
nearest mud-hole, or otherwise disquieting him,
he will receive £5O in hard cash. And if he
won’t accept this offer, he is further invited to
state what offer he will accept. For The
Bulletin hereby states that Crane lives by
expounding a book that is, in many of its
parts, a—let us be mild—most undesirable
publication, and it oidy asks him to disprove
the statement by reading that book right
through aloud in public if he dare. And it
further requests him not to strike a paralytic
attitude and remark that we are fast going to
Sheol, which is a mean and common way of
backing out, but to stick to the subject. We
have fired this same offer at about a dozen
hostile clergymen already, and they have all
turned up a sad, fat countenance to the sky
and said we were going to Sheol, and the state-
ment gets monotonous. Whether we are going
to that place or to Parramatta isn’t the point
under discussion; we only want Apostle Crane
to read his own Scripture at the top of his
voice, and stand the consequences.

What Might Have Been.
The other day a Brisbane jury returned a ver-
dict of “Not Guilty” in the case of the two
union shearers who were charged with cutting
a railway-bridge during the late row in Queens-
land. As a fair sample of Tory logic, that mean
little paper, the Observer, thus discourses on
the subject:—
M'Kenzie and Riley, union shearers, charged with
cutting this bridge in March last, with a view of wrecking
a train conveying free labourers, have been acquitted.
No one who has watched the course of the trial and is
conversant with public feeling will be surprised at the
result. It may be well, however, to point out what that
result is and is not. The acquittal does not and could not
mean that the bridge was not cut, or even that it was not
cut with the view of train-wrecking. The verdict does
not assert, as in some quarters doubtless it will be taken
to assert, that the outrage was not perpetrated by
unionists, and was not one of the many' and one of the
■worst outrages undoubtedly perpetrated in the supposed
interests of the strikers and against the pastoralists and
free labourers. More than that, it does not positively
assert that the two individuals put on trial for the offence
were not the actual perpetrators of the deed. All that it
does assert is that in the view of the jury there is not
sufficient or sufficiently clear or reliable evidence to con-
clusively sheet homo the guilt to the accused.
The Observer is so particularly anxious to
point out what this verdict does not prove that
the subject is worth expanding. For instance,
the same verdict doesn’t prove either that the
Observer staff didn’t cut the bridge them-
selves ; in fact, it is further from proving that
than it is from proving the other thing, for
while the jury gave the two shearers a clean
certificate of character it didn’t give the
Observer a certificate of any kind. Neither
does the verdict positively assert that the editor
of the paper didn’t boil his aunt alive—in fact,
it takes no notice of such a possibility, and
therefore, by the same process of reason-
ing, he may have done it. Further, the
jury doesn’t seem to have stated that
the proprietor didn’t strangle a female in
Peru ; consequently, though we never heard
of him doing such a thing, he may have com-
mitted that outrage for all the verdict proves to
the contrary. The Observer’s remarks are
simply a pathetic appeal to the people not to be
rashly led into thinking these two objectionable
unionists are innocent, for though they have
been acquitted, and nothing has been proved
against them, yet they may have tried to
wreck that train after all. It is a mean, base,
hog-like device, for the argument that a man
may be guilty, despite the fact that nothing
has been proved against him, can apply with
equal force to any individual or any crime
under the sun. In fact, no one, so far as we
know, has ever proved that the man who wrote
these same statements hasn’t got four injured
wives chained up in an attic and eleven more
in a cellar, and his character wants clearing
for exactly the same reason as do the characters
of M'Kenzie and Riley— not because anybody
has proved that he did anything, but because
nobody has proved that he didn’t do anything.
And lastly, it would be interesting to know
why in this particular case the verdict of “ not
guilty” does not mean exactly what it says.
For whenever an influential citizen is found
“not guilty” on any charge the Observer
doesn’t, and daren’t, publish a leading article
pointing out that the words mean nothing and
don’t even prove that the jury have faith in his
innocence, and why it should do such a thing
in this instance isn’t explained.
Unique Land Policies.
Like “ Diok Deaueye,” the land policy of the
Queensland Government is a bit “triangular.”
Three separate Land Bills have been introduced
into the Queensland Legislature this session.
One of these permits “ unconditional selec-
tion another Bill proposes to sell country
lands distant 20 miles from any railway or
navigable stream at 10s. per acre ; and the
third proposes to buy back improved lands
(formerly sold on as easy, if not easier terms !)
at a valuation, and rc-scll them in smaller
sections. All this is pretty steep from a
Government whose Premier, in 1883, came
into power with a swinging majority on the
Anti-Black-Labour and the “ Preserve-the-
Land -to - the - People ” cry ; and whose first
Minister for Lands introduced a Bill in 1884,
known still as the Dutton Act, that entirely
reversed the land-sales policy of the past, ran
the land revenue down almost to zero,
and necessitated the voting (in a couple of
hours, late in one sitting) of a 10-million loan,
which was spent even before its various portions
Avere actually received. The first-mentioned
Bill means that a man may select, without any
conditions as to personal residence, not only 1280
acres for himself, but 1280 more for his wife, and
1280 besides for each of his children, his man-
servants, and his maid-servants. —all that he has
to do is to pay Is. per acre per annum for 20
years, without interest. This is “preserving
the land for the people ” with a vengeance.
Barlow, Glassey, Salkeld, and other M’s.P.
tried hard to insist on “personal residence,”
declaring that the Bill as it stood was simply
inviting wholesale dummyism, but Minister of
Lands Cowley avowed that the very principle
of the Bill was “ unconditional selection,” so
that they could not make any condition as
to residence or anything else whatsoever.
Premier Griffith, Avith legal sinuosity, argued
that the effect of the imposition of “conditions”
in the, past had been “ to encourage fraud, to
create artificial crime, and to make people
belie\ T e they were doing an honest thing when
they committed perjury.” Which is merely an
admission that the administrative officers
have been blind to dummyism, or wilfully
negligent in their duty. An attempt to
permit those settlers who had paid their'
own passages from Europe, and who had been
rewarded Avith “land orders,” to select under
this Act by payment with the said “land
orders,” Avas promptly suppressed, Cowley’s.
candid confession being that the Government-
wanted spot cash every year, and not their own
I. O.U.’s back again. Co-operative selection by
associations of selectors — d la the great Alice
River venture —is specially provided for, in the
matter of allowing one-half of the associated
members to go away and earn money on wages
while the others stay on and improve the ■
selections ; but, as this is supposed to be an
“unconditional” Bill, the privilege thus
granted to the poor settler is nil —he is allowed
to crowd through Avith partial “residence” as
an act of grace Avhen other settlers are free
of residence conditions altogether. Further,
these co-operative selectors are only allowed a
60-acre patch to each man, and all the patches
must be contiguous. J. G. Drake’s endeavour
to insert village-settlement clauses was sat upon
and flattened out by a vote of 28 to 11. The
Government does not propose to help selectors ;
it requires the selectors to help the Govern'
ment. In fact, the whole position is unique.
The Government is going to pay a top
price for land Avhich it disposed of for
a song years ago, in the hope that it can
cut this land up into farms and re-sell it to
agriculturists. Then, as a set-off, it is going
to sell, in large hunks, as much land as
capitalists Avill buy, at another song, so that, a
quarter of a century hence, a future Govern-
ment can repurchase it at fabulous figures.
Meanwhile, Treasurer MTlavraith cries out
for “Money, more money!” He can’t get
loans, and he won’t propose any more taxation,
because “Federation is coming”—which seems
about as much to the point as the coming of the
potato-bug. And therefore the Coalition lives
on temporary dodges and 800 per shent ex-
pedients, and would sell its mother’s bones to
raise the wind, and its one principle is that it
matters nothing though the country is Avrecked
for a century if Griffith and MTlavraith can
only keep their billets 12 months longer.
At Sydney Quarter Sessions, the other day,
counsel for the defence complained that the
Crown Law authorities had refused to show
prisoner the depositions unless he paid a fee of
10s. 6d. Crown counsel explained that the
10s. 6d. in question was demanded for a copy of
the depositions, and that prisoners could not
possibly be alloAved to read the original deposi-
tions, inasmuch as the destruction or mutilation
thereof might mean the utter destruction of the
Crown case. The Bulletin grants this con-
tention, but it holds that the Crown officials
should supply free of cost to every committed
prisoner a copy of the depositions in his case—
in other words, with the details of the allega-
tions against him. Attorney-General Simpson
Avill surely see the reasonableness of this. A
committed prisoner may not have IDs. 6d. in
the world, and if he be not able to get the
depositions before bis trial that fact alone may
be the cause of sending him to gaol, even
though he have justice on his side. It is surely
< quite enough that the Crown should have a
penniless committed man under lock and key,
unprovided with counsel, and debarred from
communicating Avith his friends and Avitnesses
save through the unprejudiced policemen who
are hunting up evidence against him 1 The
Crown Luav department has a staff quite big
enough to enable it to give every prisoner
immediately after his committal a free cony of
the depositions in his case.

T. S. RICHARDSON,
General Manager
Parkes, the Incurable.
In the New South Wales Assembly last Monday,
Mr. Houghton raised a great democratic issue,
and was contemptuously snuffed out amid
general indifference. The question was one of
vital importance to the Australian nation—ten
times more important even than the crippled
and maimed Representation of the People Bill,
which cumbersome carcase has fallen upon evil
days, and is no longer of much use to anybody ;
and twenty times more important than any
other item in all the programmes of all the par-
ties in New South Wales politics. What Mr.
Houghton demanded was virtually the intro-
duction of the Referendum as practised in
Switzerland, by which any vital principle can
be settled by a direct vote of the people, instead
of being lost amid the chaos of politics, and
hung up to dry that it may serve as a party
watchword through all the ages. The fiscal
question is one which needs settlement, and,
therefore, the speaker suggested that the
new system should be applied to it first
of all, and that the nation should thus
resolve the question of Protection or Foreign-
trade in one definite act. Under the present
method nothing ever is or can be settled. The
only way in which the country can express its
opinion upon anything is by holding a general
election, and then it returns a definite verdict
on nothing at all, for it cannot vote for mea-
sures, but only for men. Therefore, the Repub-
lican Protectionist has often to vote for a
Foreign-trader for the sake of his republicanism,
or for an Imperialist because of his protectionist
views, and the individual who wants Federa-
tion, Protection and Land Nationalisation has
generally to vote against one of his principles
for the sake of the other two, or else against
two of them for the sake of the third. Then
the Protectionist constituency returns a Labour
member because of his democratic programme,
and when he gets in he probably has no demo-
cratic programme worth speaking of, and goes
solid for Foreign-trade ; and the Foreign-trade
constituency returns a Protectionist because he
is going to furnish a new railway, and when he
is in he goes bodily for Protection and forgets
the railway ; and everything is chaos and ruin
and disaster. Even the One-Man-One-Vote
principle will do nothing at all to sort things
out, for the district which wants to go for
eight distinct principles, will still find itself
haunted by four candidates who have two
of these principles apiece, and whichever
it votes for, it must vote against six of its
cherished convictions to save the other two.
The only way out of this hideous riot and con-
fusion is by allowing the nation to decide any
one great principle by a direct vote, and thus
save it from being tangled up with drainage,
railway and Dead House problems, and pre-
vent Protection being lost on account of un-
justifiable expenditure in the Works Office, or
Federation going to wreck over a Divorce Bill.
But the old and slimy variety of politician lives
upon all this confusion, and therefore to
Parkes and his particular satellites the
Referendum is intensely objectionable. The
loud and hairy Foreign-trade boss rose in his
might, and the scheme was cast out on the
following alleged grounds :
Sir Henry Parkes would like to know how Mr.
Houghton could expect he had picked out something
which would be a cure for the evils to which controver-
sial politics were subject when all the men who had gone
before him had never thought of anything of the sort-
men who had shaped the destinies of the country in such
a manner as to place her in a position of lawful equality
with most countries of the world.
For dense, pig-headed, ignorant, blatant Tory-
ism, these utterances stand absolutely alone.
They simply amount to the assertion that the
new reform is useless because Parkes never
thought about it, and the ancient driveller
wants to know how anything that never
struggled into his narrow intelligence can be
any good. He is the essence of J. Bullism—
the last conceivable possibility in the way
of dull Conservatism—the summit and pin-
nacle of human vanity. On the same
basis Parkes himself is of no account
because the people who went before didn’t
think of him, and steam and electri-
city are mere chimeras because they never
occurred to some naked savage of old times,
and nothing at all is of the slightest value
because there was always some dull clod just
like Parkes who didn’t dream that it was
coming. The statement practically asserts
that Parkes and his predecessors are the sum
and total of human wisdom, and what they
didn’t know doesn’t exist, and what they didn’t
foresee will never take place. Any assemblage
with a reasonable amount of brains would have
risen then and there, and voted the old man
into a Home for Incurable Bigots, but probably
the New South Wales Assembly thought he was
there already. Anyhow it concluded that the
Premier was right, and the Referendum is hung
up indefinitely because Parkes didn’t think
about it first.

Robert Campbell, 19 years old, an em-
ploye in the Melbourne Telegraph Office, while
fooling with a pistol, managed to explode it. The
ramrod entered his left cheek just below the eye,
pierced through brain and skull, and stuck out of
the top of his head to the length of 7\ inches.
Campbell never lost consciousness nor nerve, but
wanted a mate to “ pull out the blooming thing.”
The mate wasn’t game, so Campbell walked into
Camberwell—a mile or so—and saw a doctor, who
advised him to go to Melbourne hospital. Five
hours after the accident Campbell entered the
casualty ward at that institution, being still
strong and perfectly conscious. Later on, the
operation of trephining and removing the ramrod
was performed. The patient may die of town-
hospitalism; if he recovers, the sight of his left
eye won’t. We have of late had, in Australia, a
marvellous lot of tough patients with brain-
’tjuries.
[?]
846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Oct. 14,1891.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
People who assert the moral superiority of Woman will
be interested to learn that at the Sydney ’Varsity junior
exams, quite as many girls as boys were caught with
dates marked on their finger-nails and their hollow teeth
filled with worked-out propositions of Euclid. Also that
a Victorian postmistress detected in letter-stealing has
been formally convicted and allowed her liberty on her
father's recognisances. As a youth thus circumstanced
would have got a year’s gaol at least, I hold that our sex
enjoys useful privileges even if it has not yet been given
its “rights.” Shall we lose the privileges when we get
the “ rights,” I wonder?
Woman is certainly knocking off the conventional
shackles with a cold chisel. She now tours with a valet!
At least, one gathers as much from the fact that among
the saloon passengers by a recently-arrived ?. and O.
mailboat were “Miss Blank and manservant!” Now, if
the lady hadn’t posed as a spinster, one might charitably
conclude that “ manservant ” was only the same weary,
bald, male pansy-blossom shaken down at last to his
proper verbal place in the connubial scheme, but as
“ Miss,” such a charitable explanation gangs agley.
Like all distinguished histrions, Nellie Farren (who
leaves us on 26th inst. to join the Oroya at Adelaide) will
forge homewards with an Australian pet, since somebody
—actuated, no doubt, by the exceeding fitness of such a
gift—has presented her with a laughing-jackass. It was
an inspired present to make the Light of Burlesque, and
will remind her of the front rows at Australian theatres
every time the bird emits his vacuous cackle. By the
way, Sylvia Grey copies the “ ha-ha-ha-hoo-hoo-hoo ” of
Jacky so naturally that it’s ten to one the London
“ Johnnies ” hear it in the next Gaiety burlesque. By the
way, the average Gaiety girl carefully leaves her Austra-
lian pet behind.
There seems to be more method about “ Cinder-Ellen ”
at the Royal than there was in “Ruy Bias,” and if the
fairy classic isn’t much in evidence there is a faint sem-
blance of a pantomime plot, the music is pretty and the
mounting very tippy. Florence and Sylvia’s dance in the
first act would go better if the ladies really cracked their
little whips, but their dresses—white satin and blue habits
respectively, with plumed hats en suite, looked charming.
Miss Farren wore two frocky dazzlers, both in the last
act. One in cream satin bordered with ostrich-tips round
the hem and embroidered frontally in gold and silver,
Qainsboro’ hat a mass of cream ostrich tips and diamonds
winking all about her; the other, a wedding-dress
(somehow stage wedding costumes always have a
weird and unkind presence) a| rich white satin
with an express train, the whole trimmed with orange
blossoms. Levey’s brown and yellow turn-out, trimmed
with gold filigree, rather suggested oranges and coffee,
and Danby’s gas-green coat, in the last act, was a living
object lesson as to why a short, puffy person mustn’t
wear a basque, but everything else was like a milliner’s
dream in a prism. The staging was really festive—
especially the closing scene, a high background of
immense bouquets with long sprays of lilies-of-the-valley,
lit from behind in every colour of the rainbow, which, if
it did enhance the pantomimic impression, yet left a
pretty picture in the mind’s eye, Horatio. On the fourth
night there were several theatre parties in the circle—the
largest including a pretty girl in yellow Bengaline with a
chaplet of Russian violets and a cluster at the corsage.
A fainted-hearted handful of “ who-is-it’s?” turned up
at Sydney Association Ground on 7th instant to see a
team of typical Potts Pointers give the Gaiety Co.
cricketers “ beans”—the victory being largely due to the
absence of the intending benedict Turner, who was to
have strengthened the weak bowling power of the grease-
paint eleven. J. C. Williamson, fresh from Melbourne,
wore an aesthetic suit of striped flannel and played a hot
game for the Gaieties. Danby looked fatter than ever in
white flannels ; and a bold scout had slipped his cricket-
ing rig, crimson socks and all, over his black suit with the
result that his two ankles presented as many puffs and
depressions as the foundered fore-legs of the horse the
dealer sells you in a dark corner. But I didn’t go to
wrangle about the cricketers or the game they played—
and as I gazed round the quarter-filled members’ stand
or some little fashionable tin goddess to keep my eye on
behold the only two possible gaping-stocks on top were
Nellie Farren and Sylvia Grey.
It was a golden opportunity for a chat with Everybody’s
Nellie, who hasn’t been receiving many people owing to
various physical woes, culminating in a troublesome
ankle, and I slipped into a chair beside the wonderful
creature and abased myself at her tan feet. She looked
25 (with the sun behind her), and wore a mauve robe, en
polonaise, with sleeves and band of velvet and guipure
girdle en suite, grey jacket lined with grey silk, and
straw bonnet trimmed with green velvet, pansies, and
mignonette, and strings of mauve ribbon. She hadn’t a
smear of powder anywhere—neither had Sylvia Grey,
although her little tip-tilted nose is sun-kissed to whole-
sale lengths. “ None of the Gaiety ladies ’’(she didn’t call
’em Gaiety gals, observe), said Nellie, “ ever paintoff the
stage,” in which case, I thought, the venturesome dude
doesn’t risk arsenical poisoning when he spoons a Gaiety
Tottie on the way to Rock Lily on a Sunday-but I said
nothing. Miss Farren was deeply interested in the match,
but between whiles sh 6 told me with a voice and manner
we pay seven-and-six to gloat over from the d.c. that in
“ Ruy Bias ” she bade adieu to boys’ parti fot over, and
that “Cinder-Ellen” is the very last burl&quc 'in which
she will exhibit her shapely figure—she didn’t ’exactly say
that, but / say it. After that comedy roles. “ Burlesque
is so trying,” she said—“ to have losing, dance, speak, and
act—Just fancy 1 ” “ And isn’t the dressing more trouble-
some." said I. thinking of the worry it must be to climb
into ao many pair of tights. “That’s where it is. In
comedy it's just ordinary dress and lots of time to change
—but burlesque ! ” she ended with a note of exclamation,
and I was about to ask her if this hurry was the reason
why the Gaiety Company put as little on as possible, when
somebody came up to offer afternoon tea, and the subject
dropped. People formed round Nellie then including an
untamed girl who snapped a cigarette out of the case of
a young - man who has dissipated a pile and who came to
join the ring round Miss Farren. And then I took up my
gamp and walked.
In speaking to a Gaiety lady, one should bear in mind
the latest English colloquialisms, in order to avoid a
shocked sensation now and then. For instance, one of
them was speaking recently of a picnic, held in their
honour last year when the weather was wet. “Oh, it
was such a naughty picnic,” she concluded. “ Why didn’t
you leave it and walk ashore?” 1 said, severely—and then
somebody kindly explained that it was the Gaiety way of
recording a failure, and that a naughty English picnic
does not mean what a naughty Sydney picnic means.
Heaven forefend! lam told that a naughty Sydney
picnic was once the means of sending some Bulletin
people to gaol. But that was long ago—before yours
truly was born.
There are some fashionable fads that want their raison
d’etre explained in a loud voice with coloured plates to
help, and the powder-ball—it is always cropping out in
Sydney—is one of them. Any young woman who
embezzles the dredger to snowify her shingles musn't be
surprised when site finds herself looking as old as the
oldest woman in the room ; any debateable darling who
daily goes all over her skull with the tweezers only
hastens the cranial effect her female friends are already
fitting on to Iter, when she stiffens her crown of glory out
of the flour-barrel—indeed the only person who can
blandly afford to ice her topping-off is the lady whom
Father Time has already powdered. But it is certainly
most suicidal for a girl to daub her love-locks with
embryo paste when mamma—a century older than she —
has hair the colour of a miller’s hat. The effect then is
enough to make the most lion-hearted lover hesitate
before he solemnly undertakes to love and cherish “ this ”
with the certainty of its turning into “that,” because it
reminds you of those depressing little skull-adorned
placards which you see in undertakers’ windows—“ As I
am so you will be!” grinning at one another from opposite
pages.
Talking of hair, it’s doubtless very artistic and pro-
fessional when you are a juvenile lead with a limelight
profile, to wear your amaranthine fur fringing on your
shoulders, covered on everyday occasions with a squash
felt, but there are times when you ought either to comb
it up on top or stay at home, and one of them is when
you are going to visit at Government House in a long silk
belltopper. Uncut hair and a tall hat never look the
thing. If the wool is frizzy you say to your soul, “ Here
is Signor Garlic Tenon from ze Italy:” if it is in dank
combed strands you murmur that “ it certainly is a long
time since a hump-rnanipulator hung out his shingle in
Woollooraooloo.” And when you see it ceremoniously
kow-towing in front of Lady Jersey with a grass tree-like
growth hanging out beneath the latest in curly silk brims
you feel that you want a hand as big as the hand of Pate
to smile behind.
Festive folks were largely thrown upon the tender
mercies of amateurs for their entertainment last week.
The “society” amateur dramatic performance at the
Garrick was sat out by a radiant house filled, both stalls
and circle, with a full-dress crowd culminating in Lord and
Lady Jersey, who came with the Mayor and Mayoress,
but not a single “suite," because the gifted trio who
mostly have the bouquet-carrying to do were printed in
big letters on the bill. The “harness” all round the
house was pleasing—Countess J. had on emerald-green
velvet made with a distinct improver and a long, narrow
train, the front of the bodice akd skirt and panels at the
sides of ivory satin richly enftiroidered with glittering
gold; gold filigree necklace land choice presentation
bouquet. Lord J.’s coiffure matched well with a row of
large rubies in the front of his dress suit. Mayoress
Manning wore Francisca-mauve brocade with softenings
of cream chiffon. Miss Manning was artistic in
an Empire frock in pink silk and chiffon with
a big sash lied high ; Lady Innes encored the
nectariYie and apricot frock she wore at the Art conver-
sazione. Miss Innes, in pale-blue silk and chiffon ; Lady
Darley, in black, of course, with a big party—one of her
girls wearing a simple white frock threaded with moon-
shine velvet ; Mrs. S. A. Joseph’s diamonds looked
snappy in the front row ; Miss Austin, in black lace and
beads with green shoulder-knots and a green fillet
in her hair; Mrs. (Dr.) Kelly, in the prompt-box,
wore a pretty mingling of cream and pale-pink.
Miss Roberts, in a silky embroidered white gown
with two little green knots on the shoulder; Mrs-
S. A. Moss, in black velvet and jet with front of primrose
silk, wrap of white, embroidered in gold, the high collar
lined with white feathers. And then a feature of the
d.c. was a young and gushing girl sitting (apparently) on
the floor of the circle with only a head .and neck looming
over the edge, producing the effect of Thauma, or the
Living Bust, from the opposite side.
On the stage the bill went gaily. In the lever de
rideau—“A Pair of Lunatics’’—Miss Gilles as “She”
and“Chumley” as “He” seemed rather too desperately
anxious to get the agony over, but they both spoke up
and banged the furniture about, and the result was a
recall and a big bouquet. Then followed “Tom Cobb”—
a piece built and constructed for the salvation of
amateurs, by the way—in which Mrs. Forbes Angus,
Miss Austin, Captain Leigh, Goschen, Chumley, and
George Forbes all articulated like elocutionists, and
played well together—the “Matilda” of Mrs. Forbes
Angus clinging and burning very effectively in an
msthetic pink rig-out picked out with green: and
Miss Austin’s Irish damsel, withf, her eye on the
main chance, was a favourite from curtain up. One
late entry of Mr. Whipple’s led to a little more
stage-hugging than the lady seemed to care for, and
the prompter’s voice was once overheard in the land, but
on the whole the company deserved more flowers than
they got. The thumping proceeds of the show are to be
expended in variegated charity.
Pressmen ought to be so careful about punctuating
their copy properly before they rush into print! For
instance, in the report of a recent bouquet-giving to a
vice-regal lady, the legend ran Flowers were pre-
sented by Miss Blank, daughter of the Mayor and Miss
Dash ! ” And, talking of printer’s errors, the D.T. let a
fatal mistake get into its report of Henniker Heaton’s
speech. It said that“ The happiest part of his lie was
spent in acquiring colonial experience in the Australian
bush. He often now wearied for the shade of an old
guintree.”
A shriek of dissatisfaction went up from the Band of
Hope Juveniles (and their mas), who were “ entertained ”
at Government House last Saturday. Lord Jersey, who
was to have read ’em a little moral homily from the
verandah, didn’t show up at all, and the proceedings
fiascocd accordingly. Also divers small bandsmen of
Hope were heard loudly complaining that there wasn’t
’arf enough oranges. Taken all round, this little piece of
forgetfulness on somebody’s part is just about the most
awkward thing which has happened at N.S.W. Govern-
ment House during the last seven years. The Band of
Hope kids have all shark-like appetites, and their nia’s
expected to a woman to be fed on roast-turkey up on
che occasion. But no preparations of any kind had
been made, and the oranges and buckets of water were
a brilliant inspiration of Lord Ancrum (laid up with
an injured leg) who happened to be the only personage
on the premises when the 6000-strong surprise party
arrived.
A party of amateurs, including the Misses Galbraith
of “Elsinore,” Potts Point, give a performance of one of
Byron’s comedies at the Randwick Town Hall on 23rd
lost.
It is cabled (possibly by the proud papa) that a mar.
riage has been “ arranged ” (by the way, how would it do
to speak of a “ breaking off” as a marriage disarranged?)
between Miss Mabel Murray Smith, daughter of R.
Murray Smith, of Victoria, and Mr. Frank Cox. No
plans and specifications are given of the pedigree of the
fiance- he is submitted as a bald necessary statement
without garnishing, and the social world of Australia is
just palpitating to know whether Mabel has caught the
fifteenth cousin-german of a duke or not.
I perceive that the history of that very fashionable and
festive Sydney supper, which ended in a pas-de-deux by
two sassiety girls under the gas-lamps outside a cafd, i 8
being dished up as news after all these months !
The inaugural ball in aid of the Western and Illawarra
suburbs cottage hospitals will be held in the Town Hall
on 19th instant, in the presence of Lord and Lady Jersey
the Ministerial party, a bevy of M.’sL.C., and civic
celebrities in profusion. The energetic hon. secs, are
Alderman Bachlor, Josephson, Stanton, Taylor, and F. J
Llewelyn, and the tickets are simply rushing off for this
last ball of the season.
Have you yet seen “How I Spent my Twentieth Year?”
a hook written by (or for) a certain Marchioness of Some-
thing or other, who visited Sydney on her wedding-trip a
year or two ago ? The Marchioness speaks of one of
Sydney’s social leaders as “a handsome lady with tall
daughters.” How grateful those tall daughters must be 1
Now, I want to propound a conundrum : From what you
know of feminine—l was going to say human, but that
wouldn’t do-nature, tell me which the lady in question
wou!d(in these days when eligible husbands a re so scarce and
shy) have rather seen in print -“ahandsome lady with tall
daughters,” or “ a tail lady with handsome daughters?”
Now I come to think about it, and to ponder over the
vanity of even the most mature matron, I believe that
bedde my riddle, that of “ The Lady or the Tiger?” is
childlike in its simplicity.
Yours affectionately’,
SAPPHO SMITH.
It the N.S.W. Labour members accept
from Parkes salaried positions on the Public
Works Committee, there will be a fresh set of
internal jealousies in the party, and then a split
which nothing can ever heal. The men who want
to do any good in the IST.S.W. Parliament need to
swear off, and take a solemn pledge to abstain
from Parkes. The old man is a kind of drunken-
ness, and the men who begin to take him, even in
small quantities, presently get tight and go to the
bad. 1 hey get politically red-nosed and shaky
and become metaphorically pimpled, and they
lose their self-esteem and take Parkes in larger
quantities, and die of him. Of late there have
been signs that the Labour-party has been taking
Parkes, when it fancied that Parkes was taking
it, and the outlook is ominous.
“ General ” Booth takes size seven in hata
he is troubled with his liver, and eats nothing but
tried or grilled bacon for breakfast—this probably
to prove to himself that he is not a Jew—and isa
great believer in boiled milk. Supper after his night
meeting is his biggest meal, which clearly shows
him to be an actor-man at heart—or rather
stomach for whoever met a mummer whose
supper was not bigger than any two ordinary
meals ? Booth says that all the Australian politi-
cians to whom he has mentioned his social scheme
hai e approved of it, hut not one of them will allow
him to say so publicly for fear of the labour
element, and it was not until he reached Queens-
land that he found members of Parliament to
openly support him. He is a monomaniac in
regard to his social scheme, and has no sympathy
with anything outside it. He takes a very
alarmist view of the Australian workmen’s com-
binations, and can predict nothing but a gloomy
future for our country should One-Man-One-
Vote become law. He is attended by two
officers ” who wait upon him hand and
foot. When he writes his name in your
autograph album he appends to it “ First General
of the Salvation Army.” A Brisbane D.T.
reporter extracted from him, in the course of an
interview, that he would not allow his “new
colonists ” to bother about voting in Australia
until they had discharged their liability to the
Harmy'for passage-money, land, &c. ! When they
had done that, when they had fulfilled their con-
tract, then they would be free to do what, and go
where, they pleased, exercise all the privileges of
freeholders of the country, vote and —
Reporter : \\ hat ? Would you not allow him to vot®
until lie became a fiesholder?”
The General paused deliberately ; “No, I do not think
lie need bother about voting. We should not allow him
to trouble about voting.'*

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have ft
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Llizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

sw-B : “The Dancing Girl.”
HER Majesty <<o U rs.”
Criterion
T n “Sunlight anti Shadow,” the mam
fnrv is that of a wife-deserted forty-year-old,
st ?J believing the deceiver dead, gains the
troth of the domesticated daughter of the village
5 ° tor. As usual, the adventuress turns up at
fhis juncture, and, caught robbing a desk, is freed
nnlv through the elderly fiance’s revelation. In
0 /final act. the lame chorus-master-a sort of
flme cat about the doctor’s house-having in-
herited a fortune, is about to wed the now d s-
ronsolate damsel, who cannot give the heart, but
cHves the hand in order to free her struggling
fat-her. Just then, news comes to the golden-
noted songbird that the wife of his predecessor in
We is dead. After a brief internal struggle he is
magnanimous enough to make this known,
and the curtain falls on a blissful reunion.
The underplot deals with the smooth-running
courtship of the selfish sister and a vapid dude.
This play is run on the most stereotyped paths of
modern comedy, except in the money-thieving
nnisode when the author leaps over the hedge
into the domain of melodrama. The new actress,
Marie Fraser, who plays Helen, the family mar-
tyr is a lithe, lengthy, and symmetrical young
Scotchwoman, with a pleasing stage-presence and
a somewhat veiled utterance. bhe is not, so
far as may be judged, particularly strong m
comedy, arid is most telling m emotional moments.
On the whole, Dot Boucicault’s winged bird,
nlaved with the Danny Mann limp, is the per-
formance. Titheradge runs him close with the
Rtaid lover, and shares honours with the Helen of
Miss Fraser. The medico of Arthur Lawrence
gives him no great opportunity, and Lyndall tries,
with some success, to get away from himself as
the easilv-hooked softy. Pattie Browne has an
easv task as the selfish sister ; the adventuress, as
usual, falls to the lot of Jenny Watt-Tanner, and
Mr. Mclntyre, admirably made-up, shows marked
skns of improvement as the boozy gardener. Mr.
Spong’s opening scene, a cottage exterior with a
backcloth of river and wood, is very beautiful.
“Sunlight and Shadow” is hardly likely to hit
the Sydney public hard or often, and Uurs
goes up on Saturday night.

“ Sunny South,” as everybody knows, is a
wild woosh of improbabilities. It is permeated with
nauseous references to “ reverence for the grand
old flag,” likewise “cheers for the Queen, and
since last seen is furnished with a fresh horror in
the singing of Governor Wobmson s Unfurl the
Flag ” These atrocities are toned down a little
bv the sticking-up of a bank, several battles with
bushrangers, and the derailing of a tram on
the Zig-zag. George Darrell, of course, plays
the disinherited heir, the last of the Ches-
ters ” a gent, who smokes cigars, flogs Ins
boots and breeches with a riding-whip in
a lady’s drawing-room, and alludes to her
father as “old boy,” ten minutes after intro-
duction. George is chiefly to be admired for the
admirable manner in which he comes on at critical
moments to fill his hearers’ eyes with smoke and
their ears with adjectives. Dick btewart
who, disguised under the name of Richaids,
played an Arab in “ Potter of Texas,” bobs up
this time as an insufferable person who is for ever
saying; “I’m a digger, I am, and what I says 1
means, and what I means I does.” Christum,
very red and rosy, as usual is abducted with dira-
culty, while in a dead faint. Arthur Greenaway
is compelled to disguise his too fatal beautyas
Eli Grup. Mr. Wilson has furnished some
excellent scenery. “Transported for Life” on
Saturday night.

“ Woodbarrow Farm ” has not been
successful in attracting folks to Her Majesty s a 8
its merits, literary and histrionic, deserved. Lack
of appreciation is, however, not wholly respon-
sible for want of patronage; despite the Gaiety
success, things theatrical are at a mighty low ebb
all round in Sydney. The pretty little play will
be replaced by “ The Dancing Girl ” on Saturday
next, with a stronger cast than that which
handled it in Melbourne.
#* * »
Leslie’s numerous admirers begin to com-
plain that their idol gets somewhat stereotyped
on better acquaintance. In “ Cinder Ellen ” his
best show is as the pedagogue, and his song,
“ My Little Coster Girl,” is quaint, tender and
admirably sung. Some of “ Cinder’s ” dance
music proves ticklesome on acquaintance, but the
watchmen’s chorus and some other things
want working up or cutting out. “Cinder”
runs till Friday, 23rd October. On the
following day the “ props,” scenery and
dresses will be shipped per Orient steamer _to
London for production at the Gaiety during
Christmas. “Huy Bias” will then be played till
Wednesday, and the company will leave on
Thursday to catch the Oroya at Adelaide. On
that evening Mme. Warskitt’s pupils fill the
vacancy with an exhibition of dancing. The
theatre will be closed on Friday, 30th, for a night
rehearsal of “Robbery Under Arms,” which goes
up on Saturday for a fourteen nights’ season of
Alfred Dampier, who is now playing at New-
castle.

provided with a dress-circle and a stage of the

At Melbourne Alexandra Madame’s ben.
saw a good house on Monday, but receipts fell off
on the following nights when “The Barber and
“ Norma ” were put up. “ The Barber ’ is a dull
idiot anyway, it is good music but beastly
and when the bill announces it as a “comic
opera one feels inclined to quarrel with the
printer. Added to this, Signora Cuttica isn t as
funny as a vault full of human bones, and the bad
comedy in her hands becomes worse. “ Norma,
with Guidotti in the name part and Mattioh as
Adalgisa, was about as depressing. But “ Ernani
on Saturday night, was a revelation to the rather
sparse house attendant thereon. The interpreta-
tion of Elvira by Signorina Guidotti was a flaw-
less thing, and Melossi as the King shone far
brighter than did the oysterman-looking tenor,
Guiseppe Vilalta, in the name part, ihe familiar
grand finale of the third act was produced per-
fectly, and a delighted audience rang up the drop
again with their cheers. The scenery is of the
dingiest description, and the chorus is mostly
clothed in job-lot apparel and made up with red
ochre, but the voices of the principals are there,
and Verdi’s spasmodically brilliant music atones
for the variety of coloured waistcoats worn by the
consumptive supers.
“Modern Wives” lias started at the
Bijou, as a stop-gap, for six nights. Messrs.
Brough, Sass and Ward, and Misses Romer,
Temple and Bronton, build this erratic story, of
the possibilities of marriage, and after driving
the tale out of all coherency they drive it back
again, and are happy for ever after.

At the Opera
House “ The Cor-
sair” vainly tries
to catch the
spring-heeled shil-
ling and the fleet-
ing florin, but the
Jugginses who
enter the portals
of the Mac-
Mahonian house
do so in the belief
that they are
about to see a
ferocious pirate
chained up and
eating live rats in
a cage. Instead
they discover half-
a - dozen silk-
skinned girls dan-
cing on the bosom
of the bright blue
sea half theirtime,
and singing
choruses the other
half. But although
the music is almost
bad, and the
libretto actually
so, there aremany
thingstobe thank-
ful for in this
show. For in-
stance, the actors
could act if they
had an opportu-
nity. There is no
Jonel Sullivan or
Duncan B. Har-
rison in it, and
the “Evangeline”
heifer has been
divided in joints

hands.

“ Our Flat,”
a shrieking farce
in three howls,
is still running
to good busi-
ness at the . ..
Princess, and likely so to do for quite a time. The
first of a series of promenade concerts was given
at the Exhibition Building last Saturday, but was
not too pronounced a success to whoop over, ihe
Waxworks and the music-halls, especially the
Gaiety, hang on to burnt cork and are fairly re-
warded for their trouble. A crowd of out-of-
harness pros, appeared at the Temperance Hall
recently to enact that fearful infliction len
Nights in a Bar-room.” It was, with only one or
two exceptions among the actors, a wretchedly-
played thing, although the calibre of the players
is about on a par with the literary merit of the
play. Still the solemn Templars and the pale, fat
teetotallers in black coats are delighted, with the
show, and the incipient bank-embezzler sitteth in
the gallery and groaneth to see how the bottle
does its work.

The Royal filled itself on Saturday for old
“Lights o’ London.” The principal character
in the rehabilitated drama is the Tank, a very
quiet, unassuming actor about 30ft. long by
broad. There are also limelight boxes on the
prompt-side, and a few actors and actresses.
William Rignold has a not too big part in Jarvis,
the comic showman, born of the union of Dickens
and Mrs. Jarley. The change in George Rignold
since Melbourne last saw him was not so apparent
in the comparatively strange enactment of the
♦ ( Merry Wivesas in the more familiar drama,
and after one had looked at the hero of the
“ Lights ” for a few minutes he became convinced
that George Rignold was becoming prosy and fat.
Jewett is only a passable villain, but Oathcart, as
the Squire, is forcible. Sterling Whyte is a good
Seth Preene, and the minor parts are pretty well
filled. Miss Watts-Phillips, who keeps looking
under 20, is very well as Bess Marks, and Bessie
Rignold is satisfactory as Hetty Preene. Ihe
great house of Saturday rose and yelled at Rignold
and Whyte splashing round in the tank, and when
they crossed the stage and left a water-track on
the boards, the enthusiasm almost extended to
tears.

Williamson’s Comic Opera Company con-
tinues its brilliant career of usefulness at the
Adelaide Royal, and the latest triumph has been
“The Old Guard.” This opera, or burlesque
which is a more proper designation, has “ caught
on ” like two usurers and an octopus, and though
the music might be more plentiful, Billy Elton’s
eccentricities are so excruciatingly ludicrous that
no one notices any deficiencies. Influenza has
attacked Bracy, who is consequently out of the
running, but Ryley’s voice is as robust as usual,
while his acting is particularly free from that
cramped, lazy style so peculiar to vocalists m
general. Of the ladies, Violet Varley.llora
Oraupner, Florence Young, May Pollard, Maggie
Melrose, and others too innumerable to particu-
larise, are things of charm and beauty, while
Howard Vernon, Lissant, Syd. Deane, and Rose-
vear worthily represent the stronger sex m the
principal parts. As a matter of course the eg
exhibition forms a joy to the bald and tooth e. ,
and the charming ballet-dance arranged by -Mq 3 -
Royce, is a feature that brings gladness to the
rude forefathers of the land. “ The Old Guar
seems in for a lengthy run. Fitzgerald s; Circus
is announced for a season, and a Wild West bho\
is being exhibited. Also, Snazelle opens at Ear-
ner's Theatre at an early date.

Mrs, Bridget O’Brien, Esq., C M.G., rose
on the horizon at Brisbane Opera House on batur-
day night, in the presence of a sterile dress-circle,
but an otherwise promising house. For obvious
reasons the perpetrator of the crime ism t men-
tioned on the bills, and it is presumed that when
he had written the piece he changed his name and
put on a wig and a false nose, and ned to i hurs-
day Island, where he lies concealed in a hollow
tree and only comes out at night to get food.
Anyhow, these are the precautions we would take
if we had written “Bridget O’Brien.” There are
many boneless characters in it, and they dntt in
at intervals because they are too tired to stay out
anv longer, and remain in because they are too
exhausted to quit. The widow’s smile is like a
refreshing stream in an arid land, and her teetti
are as white as a row of hypocrites’ sepulchres,
but beyond that there is no joy in the show. Fven
the legs of the chorus are thin and tottery, and are
like unto a pair of clothes-props that are walking
away with a stove.

Aeronaut Higgins, spilt out of his balloon and killed
the other day at Leeds (Eng.), was one more victim of
British brutality. There was a howling erale blowing
above, and to go up was almost certain death; and
there was a howling mob of sightseers below, who
demanded that the ascent should be made as promised,
and intimated that it would be absolutely certain death
to stay down. Higgins sized up the chances, and
resolved that he would rather be wreckedmp in the air
than be trampled and kicked by an enljjptened British
crowd, so he went up and was killed. Hra ill-luck stuck
to him to the bitter end, for he didn’t even fall on any-
body, He came down half a mile or so in one sheer drop,
and landed on almost the only spot in the neighbourhood
where there was nobody standing.

Chunk from the Perth (W.A.) evening paper concerning
the production of “ Hedda Gabler” by the Achurch-
Charrington Co., for the “first time in Australia
“The play . . . caused a feeling of disappointment
mingled with disgust. The heroine is an absolutely un-
possible creation, and it would be difficult for anyone,
save an Ibsen enthusiast, to see any merit or genius in
this dull, not to say loathsome, play, the heroine of which
conducts herself like a maniac and never at any time like
a sensible being. She is as loathsome as Frankenstein s
monster and even more unreal, and Miss Achurch is
scarcely to be blamed if she failed to convince and attract.
The part is evidently most exhausting, and ill repays the
study bestowed on it, and the same may be said of all the
other characters except that of George Teaman. The
drama is not only morbid, it is irredeemably dull, and
everyone was heartily glad when }t was over.”

posa for a round-the-world tour may have had its origin
in the fact that Manager Abbey talked in Sydney of leas-
ing Jay Gould’s steam-yacht to girdle the globe Mitn
Patti. ..
B. and B. have bought the Australian rights of The
Love That Kills” and “Passion Flower —both by
Jocelyn Brandon.
Abbey pays Patti £9OO a night during her coming
American tour. She may come to Australia, if he can
hire Gould’s yacht.
One of Tummy’s daughters, it is said, has taken to

A boneless child, 11 years old, that has never talked or

Fortunately it’s an American ; it might have been an

The vacancy left in the department of chamber music
by the demise of the Sydney Orpheus Society is about to
be filled by the formation of a Chamber Matinbe Concert
Co., consisting, firstly, of Messrs, i'oussard, Schmelht-

who, assisted by Monsieurs Deslouis, Wiegand, and

at 3 o’clock.
Frank Emery, who went over to Melbourne some weeks
ago to stage-manage “The Late Lamented,’ fearing that
a severe attack of influenza might involuntarily cast him
for the leading character, was glad to skip back to Sydney
in the Lusitania. He lived for days on beef-tea and

The Victorian Artists Society met for the last timb in
the old Eastern Hill Academy last Saturday night. Mr.
A. M‘Cully read a burial service over a model of the
building, Sidney Dickenson was chief mourner, and Geo.

it in a camp oven. The “Dead March and Razzle

Lord Grimthorpe recently attributed to
Dickens that saying which proclaims hanging to
be the worst use to which a man can be put. Lon-
don newspapers corrected him and gave Bulwer
Lytton the glory. Grimthorpe then corrected
himself and said that John Wilkes was the
originator of the saying. But Voltaire perpe-
trated a similar mot before John Wilkes, and now
someone has rooted out the identical sentiment in
a collection of sayings of Sir HenryWotton, pub-
lished by Isaak Walton, in 1651. The Bulletin
herewith asserts that Confucius was the inventor
of the original idea, when he said: Welly
baddest usee putee man to, allee same skin him
alivee and chopee littee piecee till killee. This
was in 8.0. 46,978, and even then it was plagiar-
ised from a clown in a Missing-Link circus.
Ebenezer Ward, a professional politician
who has got stranded upon the Legislative
Council of S.A., wants the Government to sup-
press all societies any of whose members may be
convicted of breaking the public peace or attempt-
ing violence and intimidation. _ The Honorable
Ebenezer is getting dangerous in his old days.
Experience of numberless shifts has given him the
versatility of a weathercock strolling actor,
intermittent journalist, pseudo - selector, star
squatteu, ministerial tout, chairman of commit-
tees legislative Ishmael, and at long last a loyal
patriot! “Why,” said Ward the other day, in
Parliament, “ if any man called me a Republican,
I’d shoot him ! ” According to the ethics of his
own proposal, the S.A. Legislative Council ought
to be immediately suppressed because of his
membership in it.

Sir Henry Parkes has got out another

The services as a company-director of
Bruce Smith, the N.S.W. Treasurer, are greatly
sought after, and probably yield him an income of
£l5OO a year.

Sir Henry Parkes took up years ago on the Blue

of Sir Wigram Allen,
Spagnoletti : “To-day, in Collins-street,

The old man has lain in Devonshire-street

Our late visitor, Sir Robert Fowler, ex-
Lord Mayor of London, used to preach sermons

of which sum went to charities. Talk is cheap.
Labouchere, who was on a Parliamentary
Committee to whom the amount of Queen Vic-
toria’s savings was stated confidentially, avers
that they are far less than has been generally
supposed.
According to London private letters, an
ex-colonial Governor of some financial reputation,
well known as interested in “companies,” has
recently given a bill-of-sale over his furniture for
£3OO. Guess who it is.
Chief Justice Darley was quite overcome
when sentencing the youth Mallalieu to death for
the Nyngan (N.S.W.) murder, but he had quite
recovered himself when sentencing the Byrock
“rioters.” He was in excellent form then.
Parnell has been buried close to O’Connell.
The deaths of the two men are somewhat parallel,
inasmuch as both died immediately after a split
in the Irish party—O’Connell when the Young
Irelanders seceded, and Parnell when the
M‘Carthy section rebelled.
Sydney D.T., by a graduated process,
reduces Mr. J. P. Howe, M.P., to the level of an
ordinary mortal —“ Arrest of Mr. Howe, M.P.;”
“the charge against Mr. J. P. Howe, M.P.;”
“the charge against J. P. Howe, M.P.;” “the
charges against Howe and Miller.”
The Bishop of Lincoln (Eng.) is said to
have recently offered fresh defiance to the Church
Association by appearing daily in a wideawake

Robert. L. Stevenson compares the ap-
plause given to Gladstone at Scotch railway
stations to the adulation administered to one who
has just “ boozed-up ” a crowd. Exactly, just as
the money earned by a wandering novelist resem-

bank.
“ The London solicitors of Mrs. Parnell
have received an unsigned telegram stating that
Mr. Charles Stewart Parnell had committed

Unsigned telegrams are not accepted for trans-
mission in British communities —nor on the Con-

The British Tories’ one and only hope now
is that Gladstone may die before the general elec-
tion. From Windsor Castle right down to the
quarters of the meanest baronet’s under-butler,
prayers are daily and nightly offered that God
may remove this low and objectionable person to
'another sphere.
London Daily Chronicle says that Sara
Bernhardt forwarded £OO,OOO to France from
Sydney, that being the result of her Australian
tour. Now, as a matter of fact, Madame’s
managers did not take £OO,OOO during her Austra-
lian tour. She may have got £OO,OOO in Australia
but—she didn’t take it at the doors of the theatre.
Zox, M.P. (Vic.), says “ the public will
sign anything in the shape of a petition. They
would even sign a petition to punish him for
wearing a white waistcoat.” The latter clause is
quite true. It is also true that the public would
'‘ av i ° him punished for wearing a belltopper.
Either article is enough to establish a prima facie
case against any man.
General do Galliftefc, himself a beau sabreur,
considers Baker Russell one of the best cavalry-
officers in Europe. Baker Russell is Australian-
born. His father was “dirty” Captain Russell,
of Ravensworth, on the Hunter. He deserved
his sobriquet, for a more untidy man was never
seen. It was said that he never took a bath, and
only washed his face once a week.
“ General ” Booth’s cackle about the
reporters recalls the mother of all his anecdotes,
as related by John Pendleton, in his “History
of Reporting.” At a revivalist meeting the offi-
ciating minister walked up to a newspaper man,
not knowing him, and inquired, “ Are you saved ?”
“Oh, no!” was the I’eply —“lam a reporter.”
Bootli is no more original than Parkes is.
Some one, who professed to know all about
it, was declaiming in a loud voice about the parsi-
moniousness in sartorial matters of Millionaix-e
Tyson. “As you have publicly mentioned the
matter, sir,” interposed a George-street tailor’s
foreman, “allow me to say that Mr. Tyson is the
most particular customer we have, and always
pays eight guineas for a suit.”
Colonel de Quincey, a blood relative
of the great writer, has been appointed to the
Parliamentary librarianship of Maoriland. This
is the fat little billet which the Honourable
Johnny W. Fortescue (now criticising things anti-
podean in the London magazines) was after.
Johnny was thought much of for a time, because
it was rumoured that he had once written some-
thing for the Saturday Review, but the House
of Representatives finally made up its mind that
he was too much of a tough new-chum, tiiough he
A STRONG CASE.
DOMAIN PERSON: “Look-a-here; you lawyers sometimes takes up cases on spec., don't
yer?”
SOLICITOR ( cautiously): “Well—er—yes, sometimes; that is if the cause of action is a
very strong one. What might be the-?”
DOMAIN PERSON : “Well, my case is this here. The census returns says that the wealth
of Noo South Wales is £363 per head, and what I want you to do is to bring
an action agin the Gov’ment or somebody to recover my share an’ I’ll give
you half on it!”
is a good literary man and would probably have
made an excellent librarian.
It is once more related that Mrs. Lang
(widow of_Dr. John Dunmore Lang), who passed
away last week, aged 88, was engaged to Dr.
Lang’s brother, and the latter thought he could
trust Dr. Lang to act as guardian to his affianced
when he sent for her from Scotland to join him in
Australia. But even the stern doctor unbended
oh the long sea voyage, and, alas ! forestalled his
brother by falling in love and marrying his
brother’s fiancee.
It is related that the Prince of Wales,
while out walking with a friend in Yorkshire, met
a miner with two bull-pups, and, wishing to
appear sociable, asked how much he had paid for
them. “Two quid,” bluntly said the miner.
Then the Prince asked whether two pigs would
not have been a better investment for one in his
position. “’Appen so,” replied the miner, “ but,
man, what a bloomin’ fool a chap ’ud look goin’
a-rattin’ wi‘ two pigs !”
A certain Maoriland editor had a libel-
action which he lost because of a foolish admission
made by his lawyer. However, the case was re-
opened, whereupon the journalist made this
announcement: “This time we shall conduct our
own case. It may be true that a man who is his
own lawyer has a fool for his client. But it is
perhaps better to have a fool for your client than
a fool for your lawyer. As we say, we shall attend
personally this time to the case.”
The Mr. Thomas Robertson who died at
Hay the other day was the gentleman who, while
sitting behind the “bar” in the N.S.W.
Assembly, was betrayed by the heat of his feelings
into exclaiming that a statement falling from the
lips of John Haynes was “a lie.” The “state-
ment ” was rather high-flown ; and the House
accepted Robertson’s apology for the breach of
privilege. The statement was that Robertson, a
solicitor, swore in the Supreme Court that he was
one of those sent to buy Riverina for Victoria
through “the stomachs of the representatives of
the people. ’*
Henry Copeland’s attempt to get Hill End
(N.S.W.) electorate named Tambaroora reminds
one that it was at the latter place that Mr. (now
His Honor Sir George) limes commenced his legal
life—as a C.P.S. There is a legend that the
Innes, who was a capital amateur jockey, once not
being up to weight for a local race, strapped a
heavy bag of gold-dust round his waist. The
“ push ” when told of it expressed great regret at
not having been aware of the fact while the
gentleman-jock was steering his horse round the
bush course.
Jonathan Roberts, son of a Maoriland
farmer, has arrived at a good position in the
Chilian army which beat Balmaceda. There is a
spice of the devil in every Jonathan. This par-
ticular one had a little trouble in his native
country about a horse, but daringly escaped and
worked his way to Chili, and when in the recent
war the Congressionalists found themselves with
abundance of troops but few officers, young
Roberts, who had been something in the M.L.
forces, accepted a commission and fought his way
to the front.
Dear Bulletin, —Apropos your par. as to
Sir Henry Parkes’ vaunted personal knowledge of
Wentworth, here is a quotation from his speech
of 6th August, 1872. The occasion was the moving,
by Sir James Martin, that the honours of a public
funeral should be accorded to Wentworth’s remains.
After Martin had spoken, Parkes rose, and his
second sentence was :
It never was my privilege to come into personal inter-
course with Mr. Wentworth.
And his third was :
I never, to the best of my recollection, exchanged a
word with that gentleman in my life,
—Yours, P.W.
The late N.S.W, Chief Justice, Sir James
Martin, had a way of his own of censuring recal-
citrant juries. A man was on his trial for bur-
glary. The man was found in the kitchen, which,
but for a weather shed, was completely detached
from the main house. Sir James tried to make
the jury understand that this connection consti-
tuted the kitchen a part of the dwelling house,
but the jury could not see it. As the kitchen was
empty even of cold mutton, the twelve returned a
verdict of not guilty. The old man paused a
moment, and then sticking the disc of glass in his
eye he queried, “ Is there any other charge against
this honest man. If not, let him be discharged
before the jurors go home. It might otherwise be
dangerous. ”
Labour-member Hancock (Vic.) is having
his name summarily changed for him by the
Sydney daily papers, who rudely dub him Hand-
cock. How would these artists like it them-
selves? Suppose, for instance, the “Fairyfacts
Bros. ?” It is related, by the way, that the death
of John Fairfax was due to something of the
kind. One morning the old gentleman, on reach-
ing office, found a letter awaiting him addressed
thus: —
Mr. JoHn Pair Facts
Sidney Mornin herald orfis

Pitt streat.
The good old man never recovered from the
shock. The idea that there were in this world
people who regarded the S.M. Herald merely as
a paper printed opposite their favourite little pub.
was too much for him.
We wonder whether Capt. O’Shea was
gentlemanly enough to send a message of sym-
pathy to his divorced wife over the loss of her
new husband, Parnell? An Australian (in the
tea-trade) divorced his wife a few years ago and
she was at once married by the co-respondent.
When the latter died, about three months ago,
the lady’s ex-husband sent her a cordial written
message of condolence. Apropos, a Sydney Judge
when travelling on the Continent, not long aor
was approached and saluted by a man with a lartv
on his arm. “ 1 presume your Honor has f O ,.
gotten me. My name is (say) Jones, and vm,'
gave me a divorce two years ago.” “Oh, y t .g r
do remember the circumstance, now you mend!-/
it.” “ Well, your Honor, this is the lady who S
divorced, and now we are married again.”

defendant is a sleek and shiny-faced clergyman
with thin hair, and a retreating chin that makes a*
straight line with his throat, and a chastened eye
and a long nose, and an unctuous mouth, and L
sheep-like expression generally. His wife is - v
thin, haggard, yellow lady with a green patch
over her eye. The servant is a round, rosy, bright
and kissable maid of 20, and hasn’t any patch
over her eye. The wife, with her undamaged eve
found her fat and reverend shepherd sending
“ love and kisses ” to the servant by letter. Some-
body else saw that dissipated object with his armi
round the servant. Some other person saw him,
with both arms round her. The shepherd says lie-
hugged the girl on a purely pastoral basis, and in,
his clerical capacity only, and his wife accepts the-
explanation. She also says she feels as if she
could shoot the slavey for the aspersions she has
cast against a pure and holy teacher. The “ love
and kisses ” are explained as being a means of
“ drawing this little one into the fold,” and the
wife testifies that she herself on one or two
occasions carried the preacher’s tender messages
to the angel of the kitchen, and regarded them as
being all right. As a result of the usual affilia-
tion trouble, the shepherd has been ordered to pay
the girl ss. weekly.
The other day a dank and sodden parcel
of literature was found beside the Yarra, and when
opened the contents proved to be ninety-six
monthly numbers of the Family Herald. Along
with the literature was a letter which ran thus
September 28.—These journals has driven me to the
Yarra to hide my sorrow in a few days and have old
Coroner Youl fishing for me with a walking stick. If you
read them the same fate awaits you. Adieu ! a long adieu i
They haven’t found him yet, but no doubt his
remains will come along in a day or two, softly
washing down the stream with the ebbing tide.
And meanwhile the slush-covered, mud-encrusted
volumes go before, to tell that his corpse
is on the road. His fate excites no wonder-
ment. For eight years he had toiled through the-
blonde governess in reduced circumstances with
her sweet, bright smile, and the massive hero,,
and the dark, bow-legged attorney who had sold
off the girl’s father’s old, red-brick homestead,,
and the black, crawling villain, and the dying
infant in its soft, white bed ; and the combination
drove him off his chump at last. The man who
reads Family Heralds is bound to get into a bad
way. The soft, mild, flabby publication grows
on him, in a manner of speaking, like a muffled
snail in the night, and chews his brains away. It
is like a dank and toothless octopus that comes out
in parts every month. Then, by-and-bye, it leads
to a mild form of drunkenness, that is something
like going on a burst on jelly and boiled blubber.
The reader tipples heroines and consumptive girls
and curates and things, and grows muddled and
boneless, and he becomes blotchy and red-nosed
through drinking in too much governess and bow-
legged villain. Then, last of all, he dies, a worn
and washed-out object, babbling drearily about
tales that are continued in our next; and his whole
life has been a failure.
Nowadays the fiscal policy is always w
prominent plank in the platform of every politician,
yet is it a wise policy on the part of the consumers;
to place a tax on the articles which they do not
make but only consume? Suppose, for instance,
the customs duty is 33 per cent, on imported
goods, the wages of the labourer in all grades of
employment in a country thus protected, should
be 33 per cent, higher than in a Freetrade country,
to make things equal—but, is it ever the case?
True protection, like charity, begins at home, and
in these days when the air is laden with microbes,
bacteria, and other germs of disease, it behoves us
all to be on guard against the common enemy;
old age-kills but few, disease slays its thousands
and millions, and all because' mankind is so
apathetic and careless about first signs of approach-
ing sickness. Neuralgia is one of the most positive-
signs of the approach of some physical affliction,
and requires immediate attention, before it has
progressed beyond human aid and fatal disease
has got hold of some vital organ. S. C. Reilly,
Esq., writes, under date June Ist, 1831, from.
Garner’s Avenue, Marrickville, N.S.W. : “I can
with confidence bear testimony to the wonderful;
curative powers of Clements Tonic. For years I
have been periodically attacked and a- great
sufferer from neuralgia and general debility, and;
anyone who has ever been afflicted with such,
nervous misery can form an idea of what I have
suffered. I have also chronic indigestion, general
languid feelings and an utter dislike to exerfc
myself. The neuralgia was so severe that I have-
paced the hall all night, and the agony was so
excruciating that I was almost out of my mind.
1 tried all so-called remedies, also galvanic treat-
ment, which did no good. At last a friend recom-
mended Clements Tonic, and I was so miserable
and disheartened that I purchased a small bottle
and after the second dose felt great relief. I con-
tinued its use and am thankful to say that after
twenty-four hours the pain had disappeared, and
I was free from the nervous terror. I continued
Clements Tonic, and have taken four bottles ; all
my langour is gone, I am free from indigestion, I
can do a day’s work with any man, and eat 1 ke a
horse ; and have great pleasure in recommending
Clements Tonic to any one suffering from nervous
complaints.—Yours truly, S. 0. Reilly.”

POLITICAL POINTS
Gambetta : “ Clericalism is the enemy.”
What does Bishop Moorhouse want? State
aid in Australia to every Joss ?
N.S.W. Hansard is doctored! A lady
again ! John Davies will explain.
The military, interest has 128 House of
Commons members, the labour interest nil.
S. Australia is going to try that corruptive
political experiment—a Public Works Committee.
The “bunching” system in N.S W. Par-
liamentary elections emanated from the crafty
brain of Sir Henry Parkes.
Stuart, M.P., in Victorian Parliament last
week : “ I’m senior member for East Melbourne.”
Zox: “ And I’m the Jevv-nior.”
There is now no N.S.W. Public Works
Committee. How are the well-paid Public Works
Committee officials amusing themselves now?
The S.A. Conservative party, frightened
at the growing popularity of direct land taxation,
are trying to stir up feeling for a “ progressive
wealth tax.”
Campbell, the new member for Illawarra
(N.S.W.), is proprietor of the local Mercury— a
silent, nervous, unobtrusive man, whose politics
are rather hard to locate.
The Australian democrats will stren-
uously oppose Booth’s scheme for planting the
deadbeats of England in Australia. Let England
consume her own smoke.
It may interest the P. and O. Company to
learn that they won’t get any more mail-subsidy
from N.S.W. Parliament unless they take the
niggers out of their ships.
Dan. O’Connor hopes to see Henniker
Heaton British Postmaster-General. The Bulle-
tin hopes to see Dan. O’Connor get the billet.
And the sooner the better.
Why don’t the democrats in N.S.W.
Assembly give the name of Grey to that part of
Sydney upon which the great Pro-consul first set
his foot ? It’s not too late.
“ Eight-hour demonstration” was acknow-
ledged for the first time this year by the N.S.W.
Parliament. Why? Because the Labour party
tolerates Parkes at the helm.
‘ The Czar has decreed that in future the
newspaper press of Russia shall make no allusion
whatever to the distress which prevails in the
famine stricken districts.” — Cable.
Premier Parkes, as The Bulletin sus-
pected would be the case, intends to bring his
Federal Bill before N.S.W. Parliament at Mel-
bourne Cup time, trusting to squeeze it through
in a thin house.
Gladstone reckons (a month before Par-
nell’s death) that, even though Ireland should
only return from 50 to 00 Nationalists, the Liberal
majority at next General Election will be from
100 to 160.
For the information of flunkeys The
Bulletin records the fact that Queen Victoria
has graciously permitted one groveller to use this
form of address : “May it please your Imperial
Majesty.”
The Bangabasi (native press) newspaper
people were tried at Calcutta for sedition by a
jury consisting of eight Englishmen and one
Indian Whether in Ireland or in India, same
ol 1 J. Bull.
If G. D. Clark, M,P., achieved the total
prohibition of intoxicants, and all N.S.W. voters
became sober by Act of Parliament, he would
have committed political suicide. No sober elec-
tor would vote for him.
Sydney D.T. editorially ignored the death
of the Uncrowned King. A day or so prior to
Parnell’s death it printed a leader describing the
great Irishman as “ only a cypher, whose roaring
would be.a noisy and ill-conditioned nuisance.”
The purging of N.S.W. electoral rolls,
notwithstanding the enfranchisement of the
nomadic classes, means 87,082 electors for metro-
po’ilan seats as against 111,946, and 269,512
electors for the whole province as against 304,648.
The W.A. Parliament will assemble at
Perth on December 7, pass the Estimates, and
then adjourn over the holidays. A four months’
session is confidently expected. Under the old
regime, the session was rarely prolonged beyond
six weeks.
John Bull commenced operations in Aus-
tralia by erecting a gigantic dung-heap, all over
Which big water-melons are now growing. Bull
and Booth propose to arm their thirsty awkward
squad with knives, and send them along to hack
our water-melons.
In a Sydney club it is the fashion to sneer
at certain leaders of the democratic party in the
N.S.W. Parliament because they showed such
“bad form” as to draw a fortnight’s Parlia-
mentary screw. The new Parliament met in the
middle of a month.
Since the election of the present British
Parliament, nine titles in the peerage have become
extinct. But Salisbury has created 21 brand-new
peers, all Tories. Verily, the “ British Constitu-
tion” is a wonderful machine for enslaving and
defying the democracy.
The little Calvinist gang which rule B
Victoria wants a Parliamentary Commission sent
to the New Hebrides, to enquire What the French
are doing there. Now, not one Victorian in ten
outside the ranks of the landgrab parsons knows
where the. New Hebrides are located.
Labour-member Edden, one of Caring-
ton’s numerous humbugees, says that the poten-
tate he adores had a sol t heart, lor lie “saw the
tear in his lordship's eye ’’on the occasion of the
Hamilton pit disaster. We aren’t talking about
Carington s soft heart. We are talking about his
soft head.
Sub-section 4 of clause 0 of the Broken
Hill (N.S.W.) Tramway Bill enjoins on one John
Penrose that -
He shall not without the cinsent of the Council open
or break up at any one tim; a greater length than six
hundred yards oj any road which does not exceed a
quarter of a mile in leuyth.
The N.S.W. Labour-party are beginning
to fear that they will get left in the cold over
Electoral Reform. Should the Legislative Council
pass the single electorates and throw out the Oue-
man one-vote Bill, then the position of N.S.W.
democracy at the ballot-box will be infinitely
weaker than at the last general election.
Derham, M L.A , of Victoria, says: “It
is a fair assumption in the great majority of cases
that the possession of property is associated with
thrift, industry and economy.” True enough, in
AN INVERTED VIEW.
SHE: “If I were you I would go without drinking.”
OLD TOPER: “Hie! if you were me, Miss, you would drink without going. Mine's beer."
many instances; but even Derham, with his soul-
less wastes of gall and his prairies of cheek,
daren’t say it is associated with honesty.
Herr Ignatius Singer, the Hungarian who
used to edit Commonweal in Adelaide and who
went to Europe with a wool-scouring machine of
his own invention, at the Brussels Labour Con-
gress moved that “Woman’s equality with man,
civilly and politically, shall become an article of
the Socialistic creed.” The resolution was
adopted.
Booth: “Since my arrival in Brisbane
enquiries have been made of me for labour in the
suo'ar industries ; I have had the most tempting
offers if I would only take the sugar country.
The same old insolvent cormorant is up to the
same old game. Which explains clearly how easy
it was for the member for Sugar to become “con-
verted ” by Booth. _ t
Sydney Echo is vexed because Carington’s
name has been roughly dealt with in N.S.W.
Parliament. To review the misconduct of a
Governor is “a levelling down process,” and “ it
isofill-omen for the future ”of N.S.W. when
nothing may be held dignified or honorable or
worthy of respect.” Was Judge Jeffries worthy
of respect? Next, Jeames !
Governor Kintore advises the Australian
people to put no faith “in those who advocate
any system as a panacea for human ills. Presum-
ably then, there is no system that will do any
good’ Therefore, let us not have any system at
neither an Imperial system nor any other.
Let’s put no faith in Kintore, because he represents
a system, and having no faith in him let us stop
his salary. This is good logic, anyhow.
The bankrupt Bananaland Government
has voted £IOOO to the Imperial Institute.—
Chief Justice Lilley, of Q., at Booth s
meetings.;—...
My experience enables me to state that many of those
apparently redeemed are only redeemed in appcaianc e,
and revert to their old habits when they reach the shores
of Australia. . . . Hitherto the policy of this country
lias been to import only the best characters from Eng-
land. We have proceeded iq on this great rational idea,
that the country founded upon vice—even though
reformed vice and crime—is not resting updn a sufficiently
sound foundation.
The Bulletin wonders whether it is
really true that an older and better-known
solicitor than the lucky Mr. Ernest A. Smith
refused the N.S.W. Crown-Solicitorship because
it was then labelled £ISOO a-year, and asked for
£2OOO, which was refused. Also, whether Mr.
E. A. Smith, who is understood to be related to
one of the Judges, accepted the billet at £IBOO on
the vague understanding that a rise of £2OO was
beneath the hat ?
The Victorian education authorities pro-
pose to omit the lessons on “morals and
manners” from the curriculum for the sake of
economy. Probably all the morals the depart-
ment can teach aren’t worth spending money on,
and about the department’s manners, the less that
is said the better. Anyhow, it probably knows
its own business, and if it thinks the kind of
morals and manners it supplies won’t be any loss,
this paper declines to contradict it.
Deakin was intensely satirical against
licensed apothecary Smith’s proposed Tory amend-
ment of Munro’s One-man-one-vote Bill, and, in
reply to L.L.’s suggestion that single voting
meant anarchy, asked for signs of anarchy in the
United States, or in South Australia. “Leave
well alone,” interjected the advertising apothe-
cary. “ Leave well alone !” exclaimed Deakin ;
“ what would become of the hon. member’s pro-
fession if he left well alone ?”
N.S.W. Postmasters-General have always
been good patrons of H. H. Brown, M.P., whose
name is now so prominently before the public.
For many years prior to 1871) Mr. Brown supplied
the Post-office with horses and ponies. John
M‘Elhone denounced the arrangement, but could
not induce the Assembly to affirm the principle
that no article or property should be purchased by
the Government from a member of Parliament.
Parkes was Premier at the time !
The N.S.W. “National” Association is
merely the N.S.W. Wool Dray Association-the
N.S.W. Employers’ Political League—as opposed
to the rest of the nation. It is to be federated with
the Victorian “ National ” Association and with
similar leagues in Queensland and South Austra-
lia. Unless the Labour leaders everywhere sink
all personal jealousies, they and their cause are
damned and done for, for these capitalistic asso-
ciations will, in and out of war-time, march as a
phalanx.
Has Premier Parkes magnetised General
Booth, or is General Booth throwing out a sprat
to catch a mackerel ? Parkes’ patronage of Booth
is, of course, dictated by self-interest: he has
evidently bid for and won the political support of
the Salvation Army, or else why should Booth
eulogise Parkes in this superlative sense: —“Sir
Henry Parkes is a great man. Others I have met
in Australia are great, but he is head and shoulders
above them all. His strong personality impressed
me.” Praise the Lord !
Mr. M‘Lellan, of the Victorian Assembly,
struck a paralytic attitude over the Female Suf-
frage Bill the other night, and asked the House,
with horror on his features, if it was aware that
the “fallen woman’ would have a vote. Prophet
of snuffle, what an individual to be off the chain
in a democratic land ! No woman can “ fall ” by
herself, any more than Johnel Sullivan can fight
10 rounds with himself-and knock himself out;
and the man who helps her to fall has got a vote
already. What about that “fallen man?”
Dan O’Connor thus cabled Dublin’s Lord
Mayor re the death of Parnell
My Lord,—I desire, in common with our race all over
the world, to express my heartfelt sorrow at the loss Ire-
land l as sustained in the death of one ot her greatest
patriots and statesmen. Have sent instructions for suit-
able wreath to be placed on the coffin containing remains
of the illustrious tribune.
The Bulletin can, with its find's eye, see John
Redmond reading that Cablegram. We can also
see Parnell rising from the grave as the first tick
of it reaches Ireland.
Minister-bookseller W. H. Smith, who
died last week, once excluded The Times from
sale at his bookstalls throughout England for a
whole day because it had failed to give him an
apology he demanded. The boycott (Smith didn’t
like “boycotts” when they came from Ireland)
was effectual, and The Times “came down.”
Smith’s firm even to-day boycotts Reynolds’,
England’s only Republican paper, which would
have a bigger sale even than Lloyd’s were it not
under the ban of the gigantic Smith firm, which,
per medium of its practical bookstall monopoly in
“ free ” England, exercises a powerful censorship
of free speech.
The Workmen’s Combination Law, which
the N.S.W. Council decline to repeal, was passed
through the English Parliament in a panic on
almost the last day of the session, and in the
teeth of numerous petitions from all parts of
England. The reason urged by the N.S.W.
Council for its retention is that it should not be
repealed unless with the intention of adopting the
English act of 1875; and that if it be repealed
and no law be enacted in its place, that will of
necessity revive the 100 “ horribly cruel ” acts in
operation prior to 1825. The latter reason is a
miserable subterfuge because a statute of the pro-
vince distinctly provides; “The repeal of an
enactment by which a previous enactment was re-
pealed shall not have the effect of reviving such
last mentioned enactment without express words.”
Of the three ministers in the Council the Attorney-
General was ill, the Postmaster-General was not
in his place, while the Vice-President of the
Executive Council, as a matter of policy, voted
for the repeal of the obnoxious act. The situation
is becoming ominous.
“Cobar” Kelly’s pathetic remonstrance
“ with the good sense of the public ” over the
N.S.W. Representation of the People 1 Bill
(S.M. Herald, 22th Oct.) has as much point as an
Echo joke. When he says that under that Bill,
a “ colony ” of Booth’s reformed reprobates, say
50,000 or so, could exert a tremendous force at the
polls, he loads his little gun with a cartridge that
would make a deuce of a report and splutter if
only it would go off, and it won’t go off till Booth
succeeds in getting his 50,000 or so repentant
rascals lodged within the boundaries of the pro-
vince. It will be quite time enough to shriek over
the danger to our “ institooshuns,” as Kelly calls
’em when on his own hearth-rug, involved in the
“ pauper-vote ” of Booth’s people when Booth’s
people are here to claim the right of suffrage.
Booth’s people are not here yet, and they’re not
coining here either, and an argument as to what
will happen in the reverse contingency is about
as sane and pertinent as it would be to discuss
whether the Almighty will have any use for
Dan O’Connor in the next world. Consideration
of the latter point will be only of value when two
tilings can be proved which must remain assump-
tions for all time—namely, whether there is a
next world, and, if so, whether Dan O’Connor
has got the remotest show for admission to the
top storey of it. It would be as rational to con-
ceive of Dan as an angel with a harp as one of
Booth’s paupers with a vote. There ain’t a-goin’
to be no harp for Danny, an’ there ain’t goin’ to
be no vote.
Sir Sam would hide, with gilding cant,

Lord Augustus Loftus, ex-Governor of
N.S. W., writes a Bulletin London correspondent,
seems to be as unsettled as the Wandering Jew.
After living at Baden Baden for some time, he
came over to London. A few weeks there seemed
to satisfy him, for he then took a place at Leather-
head, but ere he had fairly settled down there he
packed up and went off to Bruges, where he is at
present located. The old gentleman is quite
soured in temper, and is irritable to a degree. Ho
will not see visitors, and seems only to wish to be
left alone. There is no appearance yet of the long
promised “ .Reminiscences of a Diplomatist,” and
the publishers are calling loudly for copy. Even
when the book comes out (if ever it does) it is
certain to be very disappointing, for it is not likely
that he will be permitted to say all that he knows
of the inner life of certain families without his
stories being carefully edited. Gussy Loftus and
his wife live with him always. Monty Loftus is
a shining light in Throgmorton-street. He is not
a member of the Stock Exchange, but he works
on commission as an outside man for a firm of
brokers. When he determined to embark in that
business he called upon Lord Rothschild and re-
minded him that he had been on intimate terms
with Lord Augustus when the latter was a big
man in the diplomatic world, and solicited some
of the business of New Court, which was ; t
once gracefully accorded; and in good times
Monty knocks out quite a nice little income.
So he has fallen on his feet in a way. The
Loftus interest at Court has fallen to zero since
the death of the old Marchioness of Ely, for they
cannot land Gussy in a billet, do what they will.
• * #
Yet another monied Australian has tacked
himself on to the fringe of second-class aristocracy
—Norman M‘Lean, son of “Jock” of that ilk,
styled “Honourable” in Queensland, where he
amassed great wealth, having espoused the
Honourable Ethel Kathleen Bourke Roche,
daughter of the late, and sister of the prt sent,
Lord Fennoy. The ceremony was performed in
the Chapel Royal, Hampton Court Palace, where
the bride’s mother has a suite of apartments in
her capacity as a pensioner. Norman M‘Lean
was well known as an Oxford ’Varsity oarsman a
few years ago. He draws a large income from
the kawlinies.
Old Jock M‘Lean was a worthy fellow
himself, and was the architect of his own fortunes.
When he was in a very small way as a runholder
he married the daughter of the landlady of the
lodging-house in Jamieson-street where he used to
put up on his rare visits to Sydney. Miss Mary
Ann Strutt was as pretty a girl as could well be
found, a brunette with lovely eyes. A cousin of
hers badly wanted to make her his wife, and Jock
had a stand-up fight with this young man about
her on the “ Flagstaff.” After Jock’s death she
married again, and not long ago took unto her-
self a fourth husband. She is still pretty, though
very stout. Her daughters are well married.
* * *
Sir George Macleay didn’t cut up quite so
well as his expectant heirs anticipated. There is
a great deal of jealousy amongst the members of
the Macleay family proper at so much being left
to Mrs. Onslow and her children, who have more
property and money now than they know what to
do with. But, as the French say, “ The water
always flows to the sea.” What between the
Macarthur property at Camden and that at
Pyrmont, besides this last little windfall, Mrs.
Onslow must be one of the richest women in Aus-
tralia.

A queer mistake happened in Sydney the
other day. An admirer of a lady who was about
to marry a very frisky old gentleman, went to a
well-known jeweller’s and paid 100 guineas for a
diamond bracelet which he asked should be sent
to the lady as a wedding-present. The jeweller
in mistake forwarded the valuable gift, not to the
purchaser’s friend, but to another lady who had
just got married. The latter, needless to say,
cordially accepted the handsome gift, and in
writing her note of thanks effusively regretted
that the donor had not been included in the list
of invitations. The bracelet has now reached its
proper destination.
* * *
Apropos the forthcoming fashionable
Sydney divorce-case, it seems that the lady
concerned (daughter of a well-known politician),
now altogether denies the truth of the confession
said to have been made by her to her husband.
• * «
About November, one of the Supreme
Courts will be busy over a sensational divorce-
suit. He —an accomplished and erstwhile popular
married teacher of singing—some time ago trotted
off, it is alleged, with a plain but wealthy single
lady, the main attraction, presumably, being her
large interest in Broken Hills. The injured wife
promptly filed a petition, and some good reading
is promised.

A sensational Queensland breach - of-
promise case is gestating. He was, at latest,
mashing the Charters Towers girls, while She was
doing the Mariana-in-the-Moated-Grange business
in Brisbane.

This—from the S.M. Herald —is a fair
sample of how they put it now :
A PRIVATE family having a spare room would
confer a favour on a Gentleman giving up
housekeeping by permitting him to join their circle.
Address E. E., Herald Office.
This is a truly horrible attempt to paint the hash
and to gild the ethereal hash-house. Yet after
all it means exactly the same as the notice on the
lodging-house in Sussex-street, “Clean beds, fid.”
When the individual who runs that place gets
abreast of the times he will also take down his
old sign and put up a new one, setting forth that
he is ready to admit 7<i clean gentlemen, who
aren’t drunk, to his “circle” every evening—no
responsibility taken if their boots are stolen
during the night.

A well-known Australian diamond expert
(whether of Sydney or of Melbourne The Bulle-
tin sternly declines to say) was the other day
asked his professional opinion concerning an
elaborate ornament composed of many fine-look-
ing stones. He asked to be excused from stating
its exact value, as two of the biggest gems which
it contained were so exceptionally large arid'
lustrous as to be unique in his experience. The
European market was the only one for such stones.
“ Would you be surprised,” exclaimed the owner,
“ to know that you can take the whole darned lot
for £2 10s. ? ” They were all paste. And yet he
was a Hebrew.

Apropos of a late “ financial ” smash some-
where in Australia the gilded Moses Ward, an old
“NAKED, IS IT?”
STOREKEEPER : “Buy a trunk cheap, Mickey?”
MICKEY COME HITHER: “Phwat for?”
STOREKEEPER : “Why, to put your clothes in, of course.”
MICKEY : “And go naicked, is it?”
Brisbane resident, now luxuriating in the cool
breezes of Hobart, is fond of relating over his
tea-cup, how, on a recent visit to the city in
question he took occasion to drop into the now
defunct institution —where lie held a large lot of
shares. It was midday as he entered the
portals, and the first* object to meet his
astonished gaze was the cashier sitting on
the counter dangling his heels in the full
enioyrnent of a “ dirty, beastly pipe filled
with the vilest of tobacco ” (Moses detests
smoking). Disgusted, the visitor entered the
ante-room to find the accountant hilariously
familiar and in the hiccough stage. The manager’s
room was then sought for an explanation of this
unseemly state of things. But the manager was
not in a position just then to explain -he was, in
fact, lying on a couch, speechlessly drunk. The
canny Moses investigated no further. He just
went down town and sold every blessed one of his
shares at a profit. Moses is a good name.

A queer establishment has broken up
down South. It was run by half-a-dozen
effeminate gilded youths who had hired a swell
house at a heavy rental. They invited guests on
a recent evening, and among these were some

DAN !
How Death has of late gone a-mowing
Among the tall heroes who stood
At the front as chief heirs of distinction
Through letters, or statecraft, or blood I
How the long blade has glittered among them
And lopped off their lives and grown red!
How old Time has exulted in heaping
His graveyard with eminent dead !
Many lauds have been placed under tribute
By him with the hour-glass and scythe ;
On the leaders and lords he has levied
And from them collected his tithe :
Russell Lowell he took, and though deeply
His going the world must regret,
There is still a broad sunbeam of comfort—
Douglas Sladen is left to it yet!
Balmaceda has gone to his fathers ;
Boulanger, who raised such a dust,
Has passed to where popular clamour
Falls silent and judgments are just
Wrong or right, both had prestige and power
As statesmen and soldiers combined ;
Some may grieve for their loss—hut, what of it?
Dr. Creed being left, we don’t mind.
Poor Parnell has escaped from the turmoil
In which all his last days were spent
For his lapse into sin cursed of many
More sinful by thousands per cent.
And his foeman, Pope Hennessy, also
Is dead ; but our sorrow for him
Can derive consolation substantial
From his popular namesake, great Jim.
Smith, the bookstall god, too, has departed,
Whose back was in “ Pinafore ” scored ;
Will the Judge on his Throne make allowance
For one who was also First Lord ?
Will He crown him and clothe him in raiment,
The richest that Heaven can produce ?
But who cares to this Smith what the Fates bring
So long as they leave us our Bruce?
Let Destruction make general havoc
And only the mighty ones choose ;
If he spares one who, more than all others,
Being greater, 'twould pain us to lose—
Let the victims go down by the edict
Of Death’s all o’ermastering ban,
We can bear with the worst that may happen
So long as it isn’t to Dan !

Old Sydneyites will remember a certain
Pitt-street printer who made tracks for Fiji some
twenty years ago. The Bulletin hears that (the
wicked shall flourish like a green bay-tree) he is
now at the head of a prosperous printing business
in 'Frisco. Mention of the old chap reminds us
of his last neat trick ere scooting for the islands.
He kept a very handsome buggy, with a higli
stepping horse and silver harness —a tip-top turn-
out. This he wished to part with, and found a
customer in a reverend father at St. Mary’s
Cathedral. He took a three months’ promissory-
note for it, and, as he wanted the turn-out for a
few days, the good priest lent it him. His
reverence, however, suddenly concluded that it
was beneath the dignity of his office to give bills
and so waited upon G with a cheque for the
amount. The printer said the bill was at the
bank, but he would get it ere closing-time. That
very evening the printer-man cashed the cheque
discounted the pro.-note, re-sold the buggy—and
scooted to Fiji,

A meek and shining evangelist now in
Sydney put up at the Grand Hotel during his
stay in Melbourne. When he was leaving, the
usual waiter helped him to carry his hair-shirt
and his Bible downstairs, and then he hung about
in the vestibule, softly brushing the dust off the
apostle and waiting for the customary tip.
Presently the preacher spoke in a deep and
thrilling voice. “John,” he said, “I have left
a present for you on the mantelpiece in my room
—a donation, in fact. Go upstairs quickly and
get it.” Then he got into his cab with a muffled
tread and a gentle smile, and the waiter left his
coat-tails behind him in his flight upstairs to look
for the donation. It was all there. There were
two hymn-books in limp covers; a pamphlet about
the tail and hoofs and the blackened hide of the
Evil One, and a publication dealing with the
short way to Sheol. Then the waiter cast them
on the floor and pranced on the shepherd’s present
with both feet, and dashed the hymn-books across
the room, and staved the tracts up the chimney,
and prayed with a loud voice that Grubb’s—it’s
out now ! —head might be scrubbed on the door-
step of perdition, and that he might be preached
to death by wild curates, and cast into a sea of
burning hymn-books, and have tracts read to him
night and day by a devil with a stutter and a
cold, for twenty billion centuries. Grubb had
better not put up at the Grand any more. There
is at least one waiter there who would gladly
creep into his room in the dead of night and choke
him by shoving boot-brushes and table-cloths
down his throat.
# # «
The people of Geelong (Vic.) have been
partially cracked ever since the day when preacher
Grubb aforesaid came along and howled them into
throwing all their property on the platform for
the good of the cause. Some of them are hysteri-
cal, and some have taken to somnambulism and
balance themselves on top of the chimney in their
night-garments at 2 a.m., and some have cataleptic
fits, and the rest distribute tracts, and see visions,
and bear heavenly voices telling them to be of
good cheer. The latest trouble, however, arose
through a parson who got-into the pulpit the
other Sunday, with an awful attack of influenza
and an irresponsible glare in his apostolic optic.
Presently he began to throw his hands about,
and hoot in an unexpected manner, and to
flap with his limbs as if he was swimming.
Then_ he called loudly for a carving-knife,
and intimated that he had resolved to cut
off his arm in the pulpit and preach in one arm
and a stump. Some ladies began to faint, and
some more cantered for the door, at this juncture,
while a quantity of old, hardened Christians, of
the aggravated type, rushed for the pulpit to
choke the expounder off his sanguinary purpose.
They got there in time ; he hadn’t the carving-
knife along with him, luckily, and before he could
tear himself up he was seized and led home by the
ear. Then, ac9ording to the local papers, it was
found he was “seriously indisposed,” which
seems a tolerably probable statement. Judging
by appearances he couldn’t have been much more
indisposed if he had been suffering from imported
dog-bite.

The art of climbing up gradually to the
apex of a subject is nicely exemplified in the
following church bun-struggle item, from Timaru

Mr. Jones, the superintendent, proposed a vote of
thanks to all who had assisted in making the anniversary
celebration the success it had proved to be—those whose
liberality had stocked the tables, the musicians, Mr. lial-
.lantyne for his gift of books, those who had provided
materials for staging and decorations, Mr. Isitt for his
valuable services, the pastor for his services as chairman,
and the Creator for the beautiful weather that had
favoured the festival.
Just think of Jones proposing a vote of thanks to
God ! Also think of Jones taking it for granted
that God had sent the weather for the express
use and benefit of Jones ! Dwell for a moment on
the vastness of it !

Jack Hamilton, M.L.A. for Cook, N.Q.,
the great parliamentary authority in Bananaland
on pearl-shelling, generally approves of MTI-
- Bill for regulating the pearlshell and
beche-de-mer fisheries of Torres Straits. Besides
providing for the supervision of leased beds and
of the fishing, with power to close fishing-grounds
if necessary, the measure proposes to permit only
licensed persons to trade in pearls, with a view of
preventing peculation on the part of workinen-
divers. Hamilton says that no instance is on
record of a big valuable pearl being brought to
the surface by any but divers who were also
masters; when the hired hands come across a
“ find,” they stick to it and hand the bosses only
the small pearls. The writer knew a murky
Malay who used to swallow the gems, and after-
wards dine on hot water and mustard in order to
recover them. He rather fancies that, if he were
a diver on day-labour and came across a sudden
“rise,” he’d pawn a few monster pearls with his
conscience and then graduate as a member of Par-
liament.

A London photographer has got an idea
which should be worth a huge fortune. He noticed
that when he got a lady sitter with a pair of small
and elegant feet, she generally liked to place her-
self so that her fairy-like supports were just
visible; while the lady with the large, misshapen
hoofs and the bulky hoof-cases kept her feet out
of sight every time. From this he inferred that
the latter person would much prefer to have two
small and loveable trotters also, and if she had
them she would want to display them; and then he
conceived the inspiration of keeping feet on hand,
and supplying them to customers who needed them.
He has a dozen pairs of them —small wooden feet
with adorable boots on them, and attached to each
of them is about eight inches of attractive leg
clothed in neat stockings, and with a hook about
half-way up. The lady with the generous
extremities is planted in a chair with her massive
limbs and copious boots hidden as far back as
they can go without dislocating her knees, and
then the artificial legs are carefully hooked on to
the inner hem of her dress. Consequently she
looks like a person reclining in an easy attitude,
with her beautiful feet exposed by accident, and
if she can stand the strain —which is something
awful —the resulting photo, is a beautiful thing to
look at. If she can’t stand the strain her real
feet come forward just in time to keep the
unnatural attitude from wrenching her profuse
joints asunder, and then she appears in the nega-
tive as a quadruped. Sometimes her limbs have
to be tied back with ropes to keep her steady, and
her smile is the happy smile of one who sits on a
hot stove. Still the artificial feet get there every
time.

The people of Dunedin (M.L.) are still
complaining about the necessity of dredging their
harbour. That sort of thing reminds us of old
times. In the old, forgotten years, when we used
to take our best girl down that harbour, it did
want dredging—there was a sand-bank six miles
long extending right down the centre of the bay,
and the tide used to go out so unexpectedly that
the bank would rise up and hit your boat, leaving
you a sudden wreck with three miles of dry sand
on either side. One awful Christmas the present
scribe took a little, laughing maiden out on an
expedition there, and he was also constrained to
take her stout, grey-haired mother for the sake of
appearances. Then as they were all drifting
homeward in the summer dusk they were left on
that awful bank, and he got his boots off and
climbed out into the mud, and turned himself into
a beast of burden. Nobody, save one who has
dragged his best girl and her mother along for
one and a-half hours in the middle of a harbour
can fully realise the situation; they seemed to be
two females of solid lead. It grew cold and dark
as he tugged and hauled and cursed that boat
through the sludge ; and then he would get
behind and shove in a wild frenzy, and sometimes
he w r ould butt the vessel with his head. Half a
mile from the open water he struck, and then very
reluctantly the girl took off her boots and started
dragging also, and they plunge! along in the slush
and darkness, hauling the ponderous mother
behind them, and treading on crabs and things
amid the gloom.
It was nearly eleven o'clock when the girl
broke up and impressed her mother into
the job. The lady was set to haul at the
painter, and the other two shoved like fiends
behind. Now and then by the light of the nearest
beacon the feet of the struggling parent would
become visible in the van of the procession,
as she puffed along with her hair falling
down, and her dress bursting with her exertions ;
and the rest of the time she could be located by
her groans ; but she hung on like grim death to
the rope, and pulled as if she was shoving a
mountain. This lasted for a while, and then the
daughter gave {up utterly, and was deposited
nearly dead in the boat; and the parent and the
other fellow w r ere left to shove along by them-
selves in the murky midnight. It was half-past
12 when the game old lady and her blistered and
half-fainting offspring were safely landed and sent
home in a cab, and then the writer fell down and
went to sleep on the jetty. Therefore The Bul-
letin endorses the statement that Dunedin Bay
wants dredging badly, and will lend its moral
support to anybody who will tackle the job. Any
individual who has been wrecked at midnight
opposite Ravensborne, and has had to get two
women home by brute force would do the same.

A yarn is current concerning a popular
pressman (now in N. Q.) who, when he was in
Melbourne, used often to be sent for his paper to
sassiety kick-ups—mayoral and masonic balls,
functions at Government House, and the like. He
could always command two or three lady’s-tickets.
It was his wont, previous to these occasions, to
wait upon a certain Hebrew financier, and, after
enquiring after his health and that of the family,
he would ask if he might be permitted to have the
pleasure of taking Miss Financier to the ball, pro-
mising to introduce her all round, and so on. It
worked like a charm, always. He would take
Miss F. and introduce her right and left. Next
day he would call on old F. at his office, and, after
the usual small-talk enquiries, would suddenly
snap in with— “O, by-the-bye, I want you to dis-
count a little bill for me.” And Mr. F. would —
did it often, in fact, till the pressman one day
suddenly left for his present location. Which is
remindful of Marcus Clarke’s retort to Aaron
Waxman when that gentleman once reproachfully
said, with the air of a man having a grievance—
“ You never pay me, und I shtill lend you my
monish ; but I also treat you as a frendt; did I
not invite you to mein private house? ” “Well?”
groaned Marcus, also with the air of a man having
a grievance; “ well, and didn’t I go"!”
Important Notice.
On The After Effects Of Influenza.
The “ Grip,” or, as it is sometimes called, “La
Grippe,” although it is nothing more or less, in
all probability, than the old complaint known in
our early days as “ Influenza,” but greatly inten-
sified in all its most painful and depressing
symptoms, is once again amongst us, and exer-
cising its baneful effects upon all sorts and
conditions of men. The fearful prevalence of the
malady may readily be ascertained by making a
casual visit to one’s circle of business or profes-
sional acquaintances, when, in five cases out of
six, the principal or manager in an establishment
will be found absent through a more or less
dangerous attack of the almost universal com-
plaint of the day. But the danger lies not
so much in the disease itself, which by laying up
and taking special care of one’s self may be
speedily conquered, but in the after effects pro-
duced on the system. Past experience has proved
that a great many people have become afflicted
with weakness and debility which they never as
yet have been able to overcome. The virus of
the influenza produces a most damaging effect
upon the mucous membranes of the whole system,
and especially so upon those of the kidneys, livfer,
and digestive organs, and it is on this account
that those who have had the disease experience
such a depressed feeling from which it seems
almost impossible for them to rally. Many
have been suffering from this depression, from
this weakness and tired feeling for several
months after acute symptoms of the “ Grip ”
seem to disappear, yet the effect produced upon
the mucous structures has never been radically
removed. Under such circumstances a persistent
course of treatment with Warner’s safe cure and
Warner’s safe pills will most undoubtedly prove
entirely successful and curative. If the kidneys
and liver are at all impaired in. their action, they
certainly cannot elimimate from the blood the vile
acid that is constantly being formed. Hence we
advise every person who may be suffering from
that depression of body or mind which has
followed the attack of influenza to at once give
themselves a thorough treatment with Warner’s
safe cure. It is certain to give renewed life and
energy at a very trifling expense.

Pall Mall Gazette recently referred to
Earl Kintore as “the Governor of Australia.”
Let us federate—with people who think that
Maoriland is a suburb of the capital of Queens-
land, which is Sydney.
It is cabled that Parnell’s last words
were : “ Give my love to my colleagues and to
the people of Ireland.” On the arrival at
Willesden Junction, en route to Dublin, of the
train conveying the body, 600 persons passed
through the van where the remains lay, and
kissed the foot of the coffin, the wreath placed
on which by Mrs. Parnell was inscribed, “ To my
true love, my husband and king.”
A London dock-labourer, during the busy
season, will hump as much as 90 tons on his back
in one day. Therefore, when the gaudy parson
preaches that he should be content in the station
of life where Providence has called him, we would
respectfully ask that fatted expounder to turn up
the Scripture, and show where Providence has
called anybody to be underneath 90 tons of
merchandise.
The best Australian books to send to
friends abroad are The Bulletin’s “History of
Botany Bay,” illustrated by Livingston Hopkins
and Phil. May—post-free to any Australian
address for Is. 3d. in stamps: and “A Golden
Shanty,” tales and sketches in prose and verse
from The Bulletin —post-free to any Australian
address for Is. 3d. in stamps. Queensland pur-
chasers supplied by J. H. Thompson, bookseller,
George-street, Brisbane. Now in the press and
will shortly be published, “Tales of the Aus-
tralian Convict System,” from The Bulletin, by
“ Price Waning.”
“ Droughts and frosts have nearly
destroyed the Rhine wine harvest this season.”
This should make an opening for an Australian
wine boom. And what an industry the Austra-
lian wine business will one day be—greater than
either the wool or the coal trade, or gold or silver-
mining. An indication of its future is supplied
by the case of a vigneron in the Rutherglen (Vic.)
district. He began life as a baker, but began to
grow vines, and has now 500 acres under crop.
His gross income is now £10,000 a year, he nets
over £5000, and it cost £2000 to furnish his
beautiful house, within view of which are the
homesteads of several men almost similarly cir-
cumstanced. Again, Trouette and Blampxed, of
the Great Western, Stawell, who lately sold out
to Hans Irvine for £73,000, made it all in wine
within less than 20 years from the day on which
they first arrived on the spot with their swags.
Judge Manning, before whom Henry
Madore was tried and acquitted last week, for
writing and sending a letter threatening to kill
Premier Parkes, directed the jury that if they
considered prisoner had sent the letter in a
drunken frenzy they must regard him as insane
and acquit him. This is a new Australian legal
doctrine. Supposing that Madore (who pleaded
obliviousness, and said, with a fine cynicism, that
“ his respect for Sir Henry Parkes was as great as
that of any other man ”) had killed the old man,
how would the judicial doctrine of obliviousness
have fitted the case? If obliviousness is a good
defence in a case of mere threatening to murder,
it is on logical grounds likewise a good defence
against a charge of actual murder. Anyhow, as
Premier Parkes has several times publicly
prophesied that he will live to the age of 120
years, and as he not long ago publicly told a lot
of Bathurst (N.S.W.) ladies that children would
be born to him at that age, it is hard to see how
any threatened attack on his invulnerable life
should be made penal.
A coveted sporting appointment recently
given to a highly popular and very efficient racing
connoisseur in one of the Australasias calls to
memory that massive individual’s sudden re-
generation and subsequent steady progress up
life’s scale. Many years ago he was, without
exception, the prize “awful example” of a bush
township. He was then a “remittance-man.”
The arrival of the monthly English mail meant a
week’s delirium for him, to be followed by three
weeks of starvation and loaferdom. He was
deemed incorrigible. Vet he was “of good birth,”
highly educated, and, as events have since proved,
a right down decent fellow at bottom. One
morning, with shivering jowl and palsied hands,
he entered the bar of a hotel where he regularly
spent most part of his monthly remittances, and
asked the Hebe —“For goodness sake, give me a
brandy, please ; I’ll pay you by-and-bye.” “I’ll
not,” was the tart reply ; “you’re nothing but a
bar-loafer, and you don’t get anything here on
tick—go to where you got bad.” He was
about to turn away, when a man entered
from the side passage, and, noticing his
condition, asked “ What was up?” “The girl’s
refused me a drink on credit, and I’m shaky.”
“I’ll stand you a drink. What’ll you have?”
“ Brandy.” Hebe collected the new-comer’s six-
pence and poured out a nobbier for the other. The
latter took up the glass as if to drink it—paused—
looked at it—looked at Hebe—seemed struggling
with irrepressible emotion—then, with a “To think
that I should have fallen so low as to be called a
‘ bar loafer ’ by this woman !” flung the contents
of the glass over the counter, and strode out of
the pub., vowing—“ I’ll never drink another drop
as long as I live.” For 15 years he kept that
promise sacredly. Of late, he permits himself to
indulge in a glass or two of claret per diem, but a
Full Court judgment couldn’t make him drink
anything stronger. And this is the summed-up
wisdom of his experience :—“ When I used to
liquor-up, I used to think I had fun. Now, I know
I didn’t. I now mix freely with the boys, and
watch them drink while I keep sober. They’re
out of it. I see all the fun that’s going, while
they’re blind.”

If you are suffering from languor, debility,
pimples, boils, catarrh, chronic sores, scrofula, or
any disease arising from impure blood, take Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla—the safest and most economical of
blood-purifiers.

they say, has had his official screw raised already.

An old Indian general named Tulloch
asserts in the London Standard, apropos of the
Holy Coat, that a Mahommedan relic gets there
just the same as any other one. In 1849, he
says, a tremendous fire broke out in Lahore, and
the city seemed doomed, but when the conflag-
ration reached a building where Mahomet’s pants
were preserved it stopped unaccountably. In
fact, barring the prophet’s pants, there was no
possible cause or explanation of the stoppage, and
Tulloch is half-inclined to believe that if there had
been no pants it would have been all up with
Lahore.


The Old Regime dies hard. A coachman
got drunk in Sydney last week, and his master
sent a letter to the magistrate asking the latter to
“ deal severely with the prisoner.” An equivalent
this to the good old : “Give bearer 50 lashes and
oblige, yours truly. J. Smith.”
According to the N.S.W. barristers,
“ tradition ” will keep the wigs and gowns on the
judges and lawyers even though Parliament
should consider them unnecessary. So that
barristerial tradition is superior to even the edicts
of Parliament itself.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Mr. “ Jack ” Want’s horse, The Tyler, which is
backed to win £40,000 in the Melbourne Cup, came out in
the Rosehill Handicap on Saturday after a long absence
from public. He was backed down to level money, and
as he had been heating Muriel and Theodore in his work,
it looked good goods, but he was like the little boy who
fell out of the balloon, not in it, and actually finished last
but one. If The Tyler now starts for the Melbourne Cup
he can hardly have shown his true form at Rosehill.
# * #
There was a good deal of betting over the Caul-
field events in the Paddock at Rosehill on Saturday.
Several wires went through to say that Marvel was a non-
starter for the Caulfield Stakes, and at one time 5 to 1
was freely offered against him, and 2 to 1 that he would
not start, so that his win came rather as a surprise. Mr.
George Hill was at Rosehill, and said that to the best of
his knowledge Marvel would start for the Stakes, but then
Mr. Hill is not one of the sportsmen w ho carry their
intentions on their sleeve. In fact, Mr. Hill is one of the
sort who usually has a bit up his sleeve.
# # *
The result of the Caulfield Guineas would lead
one to suppose that Stromboli, the son of Chester, has a
soft spot in him, and, like his brother, Volcano, will yet
descend to a Selling Plater.
# # •
Breeding does not always tell. On the first day
of the Warwick Farm meeting the Selling Race field was
composed of five horses, two of them being by Chester.
Neither of them ran well, and the winner turned up in a
horse by the Works from an unknown mare.
# # •
Rather a “nice ” point came before the umpire
in the Carlton-Sydney match. Sydneys were at the
wickets, and one of the batsmen cut the ball boundary-
wards. Turner chased and held the hall half a yard from
the fence, but the impetus carried him to the palings,
and he was compelled to put out his hand to save himself.
The men had run three, and, under the impression that
the hit was a fourer, were returning leisurely to their
respective creases, when the ball \vas thrown in to
Bannerman, who knocked the bails off. It then had to
be decided if three or tour should be counted. If three,
the man was out, but if four for a boundary hit, the ball
was, of course, dead. The umpire gave four, and the
batsman resumed his innings.
# # #
An item of interest to N.S.W. readers is sup-
plied by a London correspondent:—“ Young Tom Cadell,
having bravely held out for years against his enemy,
rheumatic gout, has had to cave in at last. He is now
completely hors de combat, and has not been out of bed
since last November ; indeed, as he says himself he will
never leave it until he does so for good—more’s the pity !
He keeps up his spirits marvellously. He is still as keen
as ever on his pet hobby, poultry and pigeon-fancying,
and exhibits at every show with very considerable success.
His favourite birds are brought in to him for inspection,
and everything connected with his loft is carried on under
his own management. He is also in partnership with
Lord Hawke in breeding fox-terriers, and in this is also
fairly successful. One cannot but marvel at the pluck
which carries him through. It is much to be feared,
however, that it will not be long before you hear that
‘poor Tom has gone aloft.’ He lives at a village called
Bedfont, in Middlesex.
* * •
The Alliance Marine Assurance Co. have voted
a further sum of £lOOO to Mrs. Clark, widow of their late
Sydney manager, the well-known and well-beloved old-
time amateur oarsman.
* * *
“I often wonder,” says an English correspon-
dent of The Bulletin, “ that no attempt has been made
in Port Jackson to revive the old class of thirteen-footers,
on the keel. Years ago, when 1 was young, the races
between the * Will Watch,’ sailed by Martin, and the
‘ Sea Belle,’handled by Captain Summerbell, were some-
thing to be remembered. The amount of canvas that
they carried was astonishing. There were other boats of
this class besides those I have named, but I cannot recall
their names. It was the old thirteen-footer which made
the Sydney boys the finest boat-sailors in the world.”
# « *
The long-drawn-out game between Roberts and
Memmott was concluded at Melbourne Athenaeum on
Saturday night. The match was for £2OO a side, 12,000
up, Memmott receiving 7000 points. When play com-
menced the scores were—Roberts, 11,001; Memmott,
11,512. Roberts played a wonderful game, his biggest
break being 262, with a number of seventies and
thirties. Memmott’s best total was 44. At 10 o’clock
Memmott had put together 11,958, and Roberts was just
40 ahead. He missed at the finish of his 75 break, but
Memmott couldn’t score, and the champion secured his
last two and went out with an easy cannon, winning by
42. The champion benefited on Monday afternoon and
evening, when exhibitions were given by Lindrum,
Evans and others.
# * *
The death of a member of a well-known Wagga
family recently, brings to mind a little joke played, years
ago, on old—well, we will say, Kerfupps. K. was a
Wagga identity at the time the writer speaks of, and was
the favourite butt for the “ flash ’* young squatters. One
race night old K. sauntered down town arrayed in a long
silk dustcoat, which was altogether too tempting for the
rowdiest of the many young Wagga hloods, wfflo crept up
behind, pinned a newspaper to the dustcoat, and in less
time than it takes to tell, old K., or rather his new
purchase, was in flames. Afterclap, a court-case and
heavy damages, and as old K. passed the “incendiary”
upon leaving the court he remarked, in his inimitable
style, “ I shall be down town to-night in a new silk coat,
my young friend, and you can have another flare-up at
the same price.”
# # #
The inventive genius possessed by the late Mr.
Spencer has descended to his son, Mr. John Spencer, the
well-known dentist. Mr. “ Jack ” Spencer has just in-
vented a “starting har,” a specimen of which is now
being used at Lillybridge for use with the ponies. The
bar is of telescopic construction, and at the word “ go ” a
spring is touched and—hey ! presto !—the bar flies back
by means of indiarubber springs and the course is clear.
If the writer recollects aright, Bill Beach’s celebrated
gliding-seat was invented and made by Spencer pfere.
# * *
The bearing-rein, used in reason, is equally use-
ful on a “ moke ” as on a hard-pulling horse. Many horses
have the habit of stretching their heads out, and down,
when pulled up, and in many cases the slack of a rein
gets under a shaft. A friend of the present writer had
necessity one day to call at a house, leaving his wife
sitting in the buggy, to which was harnessed a remark-
ably quiet horse. The horse reached down to rub his nose
on his knee, and, raising his head sideways, got the shaft
over his neck, when, in his fright, he commenced to
plunge, and the lady, in jumping out, broke her leg. A
slack bearing-rein would have been no inconvenience to
the horse and would have prevented the accident It is
the abuse, and not the use, of the bearing-rein which is
objectionable, in which connection the prevention of
cruelty to animals people should look up the owner of a
pair of ponies driven about Sydney with their heads
yanked up cruelly with taut overhead checks.
* * *
The story goes that a rather aggressive Sydney
sporting scribe got a fearful thumping the other night
from a publican'pug.
# * #
The only beforehand spiritual tipster we ever
neard of was one Morgan, in Collingwood, who gave Joe
Thompson Little Jack for Caulfield Cup.
* # *
Joe Abrahams laid 200 to 30 against Dillon for
the Caulfield Cup after the result of the Stakes running
was known. The price was good considering he meets
Bungebah in the Cup on 19 pounds belter terms.
# * *
Another link between the old-time and present
Sydney sportsmen passed away on Sunday last with
“Gam” Welch, better known in Sydney by the name of
his stepfather, Busby. “Gam ” was a good all round man
sculler, boxer, skittle-player, billiardist, audit required
something out of the common to take him down at cards.
“Gam ” used to tell how he was taken down, though, and
that when he least expected it. In his younger days he
formed one of a poker-party which used to meet at a
well-known Sydney hotel, and of the party was a young
man whose strongest expletive was a mild “deuce take
It 1” when perhaps taken down on a hand over which
another man would have raised thereof with swear words.
Well, one night they started to play and the good young
’un had a great run of luck, flush after flush would he
throw down until he had the whole party pretty well
denuded of coin. Play continued, and still another flush
was held by the simple youth, and then Gam jumped up and
swore that even if he was at Government House he would
count the cards. Counted they were and found short,
and after a bit of a row the guileless youth owned up
that he was sitting on the missing cards; “but,” added
he as Gam threw off his coat preparatory to throwing
him out of the window, “ a gambling-hell is not allowed
by law in a public-house, and if there is any row here
landlord will lose his license.” And the'youth departed
in peace.

Answers to Correspondents.
“ Rolling Stone ” : We like your nigger, but
we haven’t room to publish him. He is a capacious
aboriginal “Gnomon”: Story yields the usual
return ; 10 per cent, bush township; 25 per cent,
bullocks, 45 per cent, noble bushman ; remaining 20 girl
and flood. Assay not good enough “Maurice
Marvel”: There is no reason why you shouldn’t be a
tolerable writer some day if you want to, but what in
thunder do you want it for? It doesn’t pay. Become a
parson if you like, or a brigand, or a politician, or an
opium-fiend, or become a Chinaman and take to
“ washee-washee”—there is money in all of them barring
the opium, and there are dreams in that, but there is no
money in journalism. ..“Surcingle”: We prefer to
treat the individual with silent derision. It would be
wasting good Sheol to heave verses at him “J.
D.” (Fitzroy): Your letter is as incomprehensible as a
ghost in a fog “Three Star” (Taree): Thanks
“Our Neighbour’s Dog”: Good sentiment, but abject
Verse....“ W.H.T.F.” (Alexandria); Sorry we cannot
tell you where the lines occur. Perhaps you wrote them
yourself—who knows? They aren’t superhumanly ex-
cellent “Percy H. J.”: Next week, thanks
“ Uriah T.” : You don’t state the title of your poem.
“Sculp” (Adelaide): You seem to be afflicted with the
common theory that anything that happens to a nigger
must be funny because he is a nigger “D.” (Fitzroy
Market): Too elaborate a-hoax. Also too dull “G.S.”
(Wellington): “Poems” in cockney slang are just as
much out of place here as poems in low Chinese. You
are only a base imitation of Punch anyhow ... “ J.M W.”
(Dunedin): Please send along the story “H.H.”:
Thanks. Yes, it is in the N.S. Wales gallery...
“J.P.” (M. River): Many thanks “W.E.F.”: Too
long anyhow. We like to finish up the paper as it goes
on. If we were given the ten commandments as a serial
we would not publish the first until we had the tenth in
hand “Percy H.L”: Thanks. ...“Ibus” (W.A.):
Thanks “Saltbush”: Many thanks “A.M.P.”:
We believe that an ante-nuptial settlement can be upset
on certain conditions. Most such settlements are given
in consideration of marriage, and when a woman is
divorced then marriage obviously fails. The contention
that it would be unjust to upset a settlement on the
strength of which credit might have been given to the
woman on whom the settlement was made is good so far
as it goes, and her creditors would probably have the
first claim on the money if it could be shown that they
had given her personal credit. As a matter of public
policy it would be bad if a woman could obtain an
irrevocable settlement ere marrying a rich man she hated,
in order to obtain funds to maintain herself and the man
she intended to elope with. It is a question for the
lawyers. (2) If a woman is divorced for adultery then
her children can be taken from her and she can be com-
pelled to contribute to their support out of any money
which she may personally have. In such a case the
Victorian Supreme Court once took away £BOO a-year out
of £llOO a year inherited by an erring wife “ E.M.M.”
(Adelaide): You don’t tell us during what period the
Moonta dividends were paid “Bendable Boy”:
Thanks ...“ E. 8.” (Hobart): The epitaphs are not smart
enough “A. Wright” : No harm trying “Alfred
Lawn Tennison”: What was the name of it?
“ J;B.” (Bingara): Thanks “A.C.”: Pyrmont was so
called from the discovery of a spring on a farm owned
by John M'Arthur there. John himself was the dis-
coverer “A.J.M.”; Artistic lying is a necessary pro-
test against crude and inartistic fact. Anybody who con-
siders how uncouth and unfinished facts often are will
understand this. Parkes is a fact, for instance “D.
Costello ”: (1.) Yes, most assuredly. (2.) Utterly unintelli-
gible. We are all broken up trying to make out what you
are driving at. (3.) We presume the Catholics you speak
of read The Bulletin because they like it, or something
of the sort ...“F.T.” ([Sydney): You say the cause of
republicanism isn’t coming along. Yet you admit that
Dibbs and many of his followerers, also the bulk of the
Labour-party, are avowed republicans. And 20 years ago
the people would have thrown every one of them out for
that very reason. Isn’t that something like progress?
“ Subscriber” (Russell River): There are whole stacks of
Catholics in the House of Lords, and have been for many
years “A. Hutchison”: He must taka all the tricks
“ The Patriot ”: Thanks, but the subject has already
been dealt with.... “ Jarrok :We like you rather. There
is a large, wild-eyed, wholesale and retail cursing about
your libels that is refreshing “ Euchre Billy ” (Broken
Hill): The market value is about six guineas, and several
copies are known to exist. Lewin is buried at Ryde, not
Parramatta “A.M.J.”: The reason Australia has
trouble over the New Caledonian escapees is that we do
not yet fully occupy our own territory “A. 5.8.”:
Sara B. did not make and save £60,000 in Australia ;
£16,000 would be nearer the mark ; £6OOO possibly nearer
still. How many nights and afternoons did she play?
£BOO odd was the largest sum she ever had in an Austra-
lian theatre at one time. Multiply say £5OO by the
number of her Australian appearances and you will have
her manager’s approximate total takings “Freeport”
(Woollongong, N.S.W.): It might be all right it every
country were strictly Freetrade. But, just consider the
bulge a protected neighbour gets on a Freetrade land.
Just now, for instance, Queensland is flooding New Eng-
land, N.S.W., with its surplus maize at a price with which
the N.E. farmers cannot compete, because the Queens-
land growers, having a protective import duty on maize,
can keep up local prices, and, when over-production
would operate to produce a local fall, they limit the
supply at once by exporting the surplus over the border.
... “ A.C.F.” (Lane Cove): Will consider. But the dead
bushman is a little stale. There are so many bushmen,
and they are all dead sometime or other “Rappahan-
nock”: Hardly suitable “Palerang”: If you go on
like this you will become a chronic and incurable poet
someday. Better swear off in time ..“ Bendable Boy ”:
This is a carnivorous paper. Consequently we don’t sym-
pathise with vegetarians. Where does the joy come in of
living on bean-hash ?....“ Pakeha”: To hand ; next
week “Fred W.” (Paddington); To hand “Andys”:
Good sentiment, crude verse “Thistles”: Many
thanks ..“G.W.C.": To publish your verses would
make Parnell arise from the tomb “ J.H.K.” : You are
the most forcible poet we ever met. Listen to yourself:—
And on the Baron’s bold belief
A blasting blight has burst,
For in his ghastly gory grief
This feature was the worst.
If you had said “ A blasting blight has banged ” it would
have been better. Blights don’t burst. They don’t bang
either for that matter.

When “ General ” Booth was in New York
a reporter sprang into a cab which was con-
veying the Salvationist from his hotel to the
railway-station, pumped him dry in about five
minutes, made the cabman halt at his own news-

nonchalant “So long!” When Treasurer
MTlwraith (Q.) was in the States, he tried to dodge

when he woke up in his hotel bedroom, he found
a scrutinising stranger seated on the edge of his

“ Good morning, Sir Thomas; I’m Popponew of

Ex-Treasurer M‘Millan (N.S.W.) objects
to the Referendum, because the Swiss Legislature
passed a number of democratic measures, which,
upon being submitted to the popular vote, were
almost all rejected by a majority of the nation.
This theory has been dished up so often, that it is
almost time to point out that there is no bottom
in it. In the first place, the laws of every
country should represent the will of the people ;
if the Swiss people want Conservative laws,
then the Diet has no possible right to pass
Liberal ones; and, on the same basis, if the
people of New South Wales want democratic
measures, then M'Millan’s boss and his party
have no right to enact Tory ones. If the fact of
the Swiss people having vetoed a liberal pro-
gramme is any reason why the Cornstalk nation
should not be allowed to veto an illiberal one, then
logic is dead and buried. Also, in the second
place, it is quite possible that the Swiss people are
as qualified to judge of what really is a democratic
programme as the small, shrill Calico-Jimmy, of
Sydney. The fact that M'Millan claims Foreign-
trade as a democratic axiom shows clearly that he
doesn’t know the meaning of the word when he
sees it.
"OFT
IN THE
STILLY
NIGHT"
“OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT,”
You will hear the predatory mouse careering
around the bedroom, madly endeavouring to get
at the candle, or the sweet morsel of confectionery
which a loving mother has placed on the mantel-
shelf to give to Tootsicums in the morning.
Presently there is a crash of something tumbled
to the floor, the result of misplaced judgment on
the part of the pursuing cat, and an agitated
female voice huskily sounds the alarm, “John!
get up at once ; I’m sure I hear a burglar in the
house.” Paterfamilias does not believe it, but
knowing the vainness of argument upon a woman
with a preconceived notion in her head, testily
obeys the mandate, and having gained the floor,
strikes a haphazard bee-line for the spot where he
thinks he left the matches before retiring.
“Ouch ! ” is the first sound that breaks the still-
ness of the room. “Why, what have you done,
dear ? ” gently inquires a voice from beneath the
coverlet. “ Oh, nothing, only smashed one of my
toes into a jelly against that confounded rocker
that you will persist in leaving in the middle of
the floor.” “ Well, lam sure lam awfully sorry;
but .” “Of course you are; save up your
sorrow for someone else ; it won’t do me any good ;
where’s the St. Jacobs Oil?” The same question
is asked daily in thousands of homes all over the
world on the happening of an accident, or when
the symptoms of rheumatism,"neuralgia, or some
such complaint make known their unwelcome
presence. Prevention is better than cure, and the
best time to tackle any ailment is when it is in the
incipient state. In such circumstances recourse
to the use of St. Jacobs Oil is always attended by
the most beneficial results, although its curative
powers are by no means confined to warding off
in their infancy the ills which human flesh is heir
to. On the contrary, it has, even in the most
hopeless cases, been found to accomplish that
which medical skill had failed to effect, viz., a
speedy and radical cure. It is, in short, a valuable
remedy that should find a place in every house-
hold.

The educational force of the Waterbury Watch
has been felt all over the world. America,
Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australasia have
shared in its civilising and encouraging impulse.
The peasant of the Russian Empire, the Kirghis
on the steppes of Asia, the Arab horseman of the
desert, and the Egyptian Fellaheen upon the
Nile can, and do, boast of a timekeeper, which for
utility, accuracy, and rough service is the peer of,
and often more to be relied upon, than any
elaborately jewelled pocket piece carried by the
nobility or richer classes of their respective
countrymen. In Japan, throughout India, in the
forests of Brazil, upon the plains of Buenos Ayres,
and in the furthest backblocks of Australia the
Waterbury Watch has found its way, and where-
ever the people are industrious there the Water-
bury Watches are worn; there the people are
daily becoming more punctual, enterprising, and
successful.

“ What for you walking like that, Johnny ?”
“ Oh, welly bad ; allee same loomatios. . . ,
Ow, ow, hi-yah, yoo-ooh, mucheepa, muckee hi 10,
wow!” shrieked and howled the unfortunate
Chinky.
“Ha ! you squinny-eyed heathen, so that’s the
reason, is it ?”
« • «
To understand the above the readers must
transport themselves mentally on board a China
mail-boat resting alongside a Sydney wharf. The
dramatis personce are a Customs House officer and
a heathen Chinee—one of the steamer hands—who
has obtained a permit to go on shore on ship’s
duty, and whose peculiar gait had aroused the
Customs officer’s suspicions and prompted the
above question. When the Chinaman pleads
rheumatics, the officer seizes the situation and the
Chinaman, and makes a discovery. Underneath
the Oriental smock of faded dungaree, from a
waist-arrangement with “ falls ” back and front,
is suspended a packet containing four half-pound
tins of opium—Chinese cooked opium for smoking
purposes. Each of those tins is worth 10s. in
China; the duty here is 20s. per lb., so that the
profits to be derived from smuggling in opium can
be at once understood.
The Customs officer at once confiscates the
opium and then racks his wits to consider whether
he had better give the Chow into custody. For,
remember, there is a poll-tax of £lOO on every
pigtail introduced, and this country doesn’t want
the Chinaman, anyhow. The easiest method is
simply to freeze on to the illicit goods in the name
of the Crown, and accelerate John’s departure
with what footballers call a “mark.”
There is a story of an over-zealous Customs
officer in one of the Australian colonies who ran-
in a Chinaman once, and when the fine was paid—
the Chow’s steamer having in the meantime left
for ’Frisco —was confronted with the alternative
of either paying Ah Sin’s poll-tax of £lOO, or
keeping him privately in custody till the return of
the vessel. He chose the latter, and kept the
Chinaman prisoner in his own house for several
weeks, making him clean boots and knives for his
keep, and having him chained up every night and
padlocked to a post near which his shake-down
had been placed. When the steamer returned, the
skipper good-naturedly took the “ hand ” back on
board.
# * #
Sydney Customs officers could tell you
some curious smuggling yarns. Their dealings
are, of course, not always with Chinamen. They
religiously search every vessel that enters the
Heads, boarding the vessels in the Bay, and com-
mencing the search immediately the ship “ re-
ports.” It would be injudicious to do so before,
as the ship’s manifest could then be altered so as
to tally with any premature discoveries. With
the Caucasian, Customs frauds take a deeper and
more complicated character generally, such as
cooked invoices, artful substitution of goods, &c. —
matters that cannot be included in extempore
smuggling. In this kind of precipitate contra-
band, the favourite commodity amongst smug-
gling Caucasians—generally stewards or sailors—
is tobacco. Take the P. and O. boats, for ex-
ample. They call at Gibraltar and Malta, where
bumboats conie off to them. At these places,
where there is no duty on the weed, tobacco is
freely sold at Is. a lb. and sometimes for less.
Here, there is a duty of 3s. per lb. on it. The
temptation to do a safe smuggle is tolerably
strong. A few weeks ago, the Sydney Customs
officers confiscated about 5001 b. of tobacco from
a vessel that had come out via the Mediterranean
and the Suez Canal. Of this lot, about 1501 b. was
discovered in a holy-stone cask, underneath a pile
of stones. The height and top-heavy appearance of
the pile awoke a suspicion that would otherwise
have slept. Of course, there was no owner for the
tobacco. Nor was there any for the 30,000 un-
customed cigars found last week “ planted ” on a
Chinese steamer in Sydney harbour.
# #' *
But the Chinese are the prize impromptu
smugglers, and their staples are—cigars, tobacco,
and opium. The last is most easily taken ashore,
if in very small lots—the containing tins being
small enough to be lost in an ordinary pocket, to
say nothing of their chances of concealment
beneath the loose petticoat-like duds and clownish-
cut pantaloons of the voyaging heathen. The
tobacco is packed in brick-shaped 11b. parcels,
wrapped in paper that looks and feels like tissue,
but is as strong as parchment. The tobacco is
shag-like in appearance, and so thoroughly
“teased-out” that the packages are flexible. A
string of them readily accommodate themselves
to the shape of the body, and a disposition of
several strings deep can be fitted on readily as a
padded vest, or a life-belt jacket. But the main
weakness of Chinese smugglers lies in cigars, and
their artful ingenuity in concealing these is worth
a hearing—though I have not yet beard of any
Chinese evasion so good as the trick of the London
firm who smuggled into England Geneva watches
concealed in the hollow of bogus boot-heels, after-
wards selling the boots, properly heeled, at a trifle
above the cost of old leather, but making a big
thing out of the duty-free watches.
* * *
A vigilant Customs officer, boarding a
Chinese ship, must look in the most unlikely
places—in the most secret and in the most open
parts of the vessel. There is the “skin” of the
ship, for instance. Does the official eye notice a
spot newly painted over? It indicates a plant,
and a gimlet soon reveals its nature. Or a new,
or a freshly-scratched old, screw put in anywhere?
That place must be looked into. The rigging
lights and the masthead lights must be thoroughly
scrutinised ; they are favourite receptacles for
cigars. Even the greenest Customs officer never
forgets the coal bunkers. They are mines of
cigars at times. Perhaps only an old fox would
think of getting down a manhole and inspecting
the refrigerator. Yet, this is what Tide-Surveyor
W. Smyth did only quite recently, and he thought
he had found a tobacconist’s shop—only there was
no “tote” going. From that refrigerator he took
12,500 cigars, and 75 packets of tobacco.
# * *
“ Now, then, porpoise, where are you
going to ?”
“ Longee shoah,” was the answer of the cor-
pulent Chinee, who endeavoured to pass Mr.
Customs.
“ How’s your health ?” asked that jovial official,
giving him a penetrative dig in the ribs—
“ Hello!”
There was a grab and a stripping off of
dungaree and there met Brass Buttons’ gaze a
canvas boa-constrictor-like coil, crammed with
cigars; The rascal had surreptitiously cut off 10
or 12 ft. from the ship’s hose, slit the canvas the
whole length along and sewn in every individual
cigar, so that the threads formed themselves into
a honeycomb of cellular pockets, each cell contain-
ing one cigar. This cumbrous coil was wound ,
round Ah Fat’s body twice and a turnover, and
contained many hundreds of cigars, being relieved
of which Ah Fat became Ah Slim.
* * #
One time, when a tide-surveyor and his
boatmen boarded a steamer in the stream, they
noticed in a nook of the deck a sheep, killed,
skinned, and dressed, hanging up, not, as with
land-butchers, opened and spanned out by means
of crossyard sticks, but with the body closed with
skewers. A boatman happened to knock up
against the dead mutton and heard a rattle
unknown to hollow carcases. He opened out the
body and found four large boxes of cigars, sus-
pended by a string and concealed in the hollow of
the dead woolly-bird.
* * *
Chinamen are very fond of “salt eggs.”
Only they don’t preserve their eggs in salt, but in
“soot,” or a kind of “ blacking.” This coats and
cakes on the eggs until you might drop one from
a height of 6ft. upon a hard floor without breaking
it. To fracture it, you must dash it downwards
with considerable force. These eggs are a
favourite commodity of importation with the
almond-eyed heathen.
A tub—in shape and size like an ordinary wash-
tub—piled with these eggs stands on deck, with
calm, indifferent, sleepy-looking Chinese squatted
near it, smoking in heavenly abstraction.
“ Turn over that tub,” says the tide-surveyor to
his boatman.
“Hi, yah. You no turn ’em out; you blakee
allee egg ; plenty havee payee, you blakee.”
But over goes the pile, rolling merrily and as
unhurt as billiard balls. Eggs above, eggs below,
eggs all round, but jammed right in the centre, a
stoutish bag containing 5000 cigars. Down go
they into the Customs boat, eggs and all. Alas
for the eggs ! The cigars being conveyed to “ The
Queen’s Warehouse,” the tub and the eggs are left
to be retaken aboard. They never get there. The
explanation is that certain men of the sea eat the
eggs and raffle the tub.
* * *
Here is an oil-tin, apparently full of water.
Boatman gives it a turn-over into the scuppers.
About a quart of water comes out. By Jove! it’s
full of tar —solidified tar, as unbroken as perfect
asphalt. A chisel, please! Ding, ding. ’Twas
thought so. Here is, beneath two inches of tar, a
false wooden bottom. The tar had been put in to
make it thoroughly watertight, and then the
water poured in atop of the tar, to make believe
the oil-tin was used as a laundry utensil. Beneath
this false wooden bottom are gingerly and securely
stowed some 500 cigars.
* * *
“ Hello, you cookee licee ? ” says the Tide
Surveyor, to a heathen, who is superintending a
copper-boiler placed on top of a stove, the said
boiler being apparently full of rice in that jellified
condition indicative of its being rather over-
boiled.
The Chinaman nods assent.
“ Let’s have a look at it,” continues T.S., seem-
ing to fathom a want of depth in the rice.
And he empties the stuff into a tin-plate that is
handy, and looks at the copper-boiler. Just as he
thought. A false bottom within two inches of the
top.
“ Why, what’s this ? ” says he.
But the quondam cook has fled and can never
afterwards be identified among the crowd.
Further inspection brings to light about 300
cigars, beneath the false bottom, access being had
to them by turning the boiler upside down, in
which position the real bottom is found to be a lid
on hinges.

“ What name him?”
“ Washee-washee shirtee foh stewahd.”
Mr. Tide-Surveyor is looking at a Chinaman
who is apparently washing a shirt in a kerosene-
tin full of soapsuds.
“Give it a kick over,” says he to one of his
boatmen.
Over she goes. Ha ! The kerosene-tin holds
less than a quart when full, does it ? A false
bottom again very close to the top—the fakement
being securely soldered and watertight. Upended,
this real bottom is again found to be a hinged lid,
and the interior is crammed as tightly as it can be
with cigars. “Washee-washee” has vanished
like a pebble in the sea, never to be identified
among the other no savee pebbles sucked again to
shore.

You would think that Sydney Customs
officers stood but a poor chance of finding contra-
band cigars, opium, or tobacco on Chinese boats
that are searched very inquisitively at Cooktown,
Townsville, and Brisbane before coming down.
But the “ plants ” they drop upon after this triple
search form only half of the irritating wonder of
it. John Chow is so cunning and so patient that
he will be impassively imperturbable about his
success until he thinks that the Customs lynxes
are quite off their guard. So it happens that,
even after a ship has left Sydney, gone on to Mel-
bourne and been searched there, on to Adelaide
and been searched, back to Melbourne and been
re-searched, and back to Sydney, they still find
cigars by the thousand, pound packets of tobacco
by the gross, and tins of opium by the score. And
all these contraband goods have been stowed away
on board ever since the vessel left China Australia-
wards. Cigars are seized at every port of call,
but more are regularly seized in Sydney than in
any other port.
* * *
What becomes of all the forfeited
cigars? In England all smuggled weed is put
into “the Queen’s pipe”—a big furnace—and
consumed by fire. Here, the authorities are more
sensible. It is bestowed for a period—six months,
I believe —in “The Queen’s Warehouse,” a store-
room on the Custom House premises. After
this, it is sold by auction, the reserve limit
being simply the duty that should have been paid
on the goods. If a farthing a dozen more than
the duty is offered, down goes the auctioneer’s
hammer.
Who are the chief bidders? Well, the cigars
are such utter abominable rubbish that it does not
pay any reputable firm to purchase them. They
are bought by Paddy’s-market men and small
suburban hotel-keepers. If you should ever prowl
around Surry Hills or Waterloo, or any similar
suburb, and if, finding yourself in a beer-ken
lubricating your thorax, you should call for a
cigar, you will get one of these. If you look a
swell, you will be charged sixpence; if not, the
beer-seller will be content with half as much. Or if
you are wandering through the park on a Satur-
day night, and an oily nigger ranges up alongside
you, and offers in a muffled tone to trade off a
bundle of weeds—which bundle he presently fishes
up from some place down his back, or in the
region of his ancient black ribs, or in the vicinity
of his thin and spidery legs—you will get the
same lot for one shilling a dozen.

’Twixt the Wings of the Yard.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hear the loud swell of it, mighty pell-mell of it,
Thousands of voices all blent into one,
gee “ hell for leather ” now trooping together, now
Down the long slope of the range at a run ;
Dust in the wake of ’em, see the wild break of ’em,
Spear-horned and curly, red, spotted and
starred,
gee the lads bringing ’em, blocking ’em, ringing
’em,
Eetching ’em up to the wings of the yard.
Mark that red leader now, what a fine bleeder
now,
Twelve hundred at least if he weighs half a
pound,
None go ahead of him, mark the proud tread of
him,
See how he bellows and paws at the ground ;
Watch the mad rush of ’em, raging and crush of
’em,
See when they struck how the corner-post
jarred,
What a mad chasing and wheeling and racing and
Turbulent talk ’twixt the wings of the yard.
Harry and Teddy, there, let ’em go steady there,
Some of you youngsters will surely get pinned,
What am I saying ? I’ve had my last day in
The saddle, I might as well talk to the wind.
Why should I grieve at all ? soon I must leave it
all,
Leave it for ever, and yet it seems hard,
That I should be lingering here, ’stead of fingering
Handle of whip ’twixt the wings of the yard.
Hear the loud crack of the whips on the back of
the
Obstinate weaners who will not go in,
Sharp fusilade of it, till half afraid of it
Echo herself shuts her ears at the din,
They’ll say when it’s over now that I’m in clover
now,
Happy old pensioner, yet it seems hard,
E’en on the brink of the grave, when I think of
the
Times out of mind that I’ve rode to that yard.
Hark to the row at the rails, there’s a cow at the
Charge, how she laughs all their lashes to scorn,
Mark how she ran agen’ little Tom Flanagan,
Lucky for him that it wasn’t her horn ;
He’d make no joke of it if he’d got a poke of it,
There she comes back, but he’s put on his guard,
Greenhide descending now, sharp reports blending
now,
Flogging her .back up the wings of the yard.
The breeze brings their bellowing, soft’ning it,
mellowing,
Till it sounds like a spent giant in pain,
Steals up the valley on, sounding a rally on
Sonorous hills that return it again.
Useless my whining now, useless repining now,
’Twon’t make me any less battered and scarred,
Though I’ve grown grey at it, oh, for a day at it,
Oh, for an hour ’twixt the wings of the yard !
Oh, how I yearn for those times, how I burn for
those
Days, when my weapons, the whip and the
spur,
The double-reined bridle, were not hanging idle,
But I’m old, and as useless as Stumpy, that
cur,
He's no good for heeling now, yet he’s a feeling
now,
Not unlike mine, that it’s woefully hard,
That we should be lying here, groaning and sigh-
ing here,
Watching the cattle come up to the yard.
Life has no salt in it, see how I halt in it,
I, who once rode with the first of the flight,
Watching and waiting now, feebly debating now
Whether the close will bring darkness or light;
Half my time pondering, back through life
wandering,
Groaning to see how that life has been marred,
Seeing the blots in it, all the bad spots in it,
Mustering, bringing past sins to the yard.
Shall I be able to shew a clean waybill to
God, when He rounds up and drafts off His own,
When at the mustering, millions of clustering
Souls come to judgment before the white
throne ?
Is the Lord’s hand on me? have I His brand on
me ?
When I go up will the passage be barred ?
Am I a chosen one ? must the gates close on one ?
Shall I be left ’twixt the wings of his yard ?

The art of manufacturing lathes is said to
late its first notable “new departure’’ from the
turning-point in the fortunes of a canny Scotch
artisan who applied at a big machinery establish-
ment for a job. The managing-proprietor noticed
that the applicant wore an oval hat of timber
material—a pattern then unknown—and .asked the
deadbeat where he acquired it. “ I made it my-
self.” “ But that was never turned in a lathe ?”
“Ay, was it; the lathe wadna gang richt o’
itself, sol just made it gang the way I liked.”
The Scot was engaged, soon became manager of
the works, and afterwards a partner of his firm.
But the marvels of subsequent invention would
dazzle that genius’s unquiet ghost, if it should re-
visit these lunar glimpses. The general catalogue,
1891 edition, of Tangyes’ Machine Tool Co.,
Limited, is a revelation of machinery achieve-
ments. Its contents embrace full descrip-
tions, with accurate engravings, of all kinds
and sizes of lathes ; drilling, planing, shap-
ing, slotting, and milling machines ; vices
and surface plates; punching and shearing,
wheel-cutting, bolt-forging, screwing and wood-
working machines; tool-holders and standard
gauges; shafting hangers; screwing tackle, &c , &c.
The conditions of supply are clearly stated, the
terms being liberal, while there is a useful appen-
dix of comparative tables of the measurements
adopted in various countries. The head estab-
lishment of Tangye’s is at Birmingham, and there
are branch houses in London, Newcastle, and
Manchester (England); Glasgow (Scotland); Syd-
ney and Melbourne (Australia); Johannesburg (S.
Africa); Genoa (Italy); and Bilbao (Spain). With
such extensive feelers outstretched, the company
employs no agents, and intending Australian cus-
tomers should address their communications to

anger, and mutters to Holditt —“ You know, old

remittance-day comes round. It’s awfully annoy-
ing to hear cads talk like that.” “ Tell you what
you shall do,” replies Holditt, “you shall surprise

and finish these liquors. By-and-bye, I’ll get up
and wish you good bye, and you can say, ‘Won’t
you have another before you go?’ and then you
can ask them to join us, and that ought to shut
their mouths.” Florin is duly accepted, and the
pair adjourn to next room. The nectar being
quaffed, Holditt gets up lazily, holds out his right
hand to Sansit, and says—“ Well, good-bye, old
fellow, I must be going.” Sansit; “So long,
dear boy; I’ll see you again anon. I’ve an
appointment, too, just about this time.” You can

Tales of Old Sydney.
No. XIII.—Andy Webster’s Last Will and
Testament.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Here and there among the assignees of
convict-labour who drew their regular allowance
of human flesh, bone and blood from the Principal
Superintendent’s office, Sydney, in the Late
Twenties, was to be found a man who did not
think that his servants were merely Chattels
Tin ngs—N uml >ers.
That the ranko of the Pure Merinos and of the
Upper Crust Emancipists did not include the
majority of these exceptional persons was only a
circumstance to be expected. It was the second-
raters who, as a rule, were solicitous as to the com-
fort of their “assignments.” The Pure Merinos
and the ’Mancipists of the first water were strong
people—people with wills and tempers, people pos-
sessed not only of an abundance of this world’s
goods, but also of those vigorous qualities of mind
and body which are inconsistent with tenderness
of heart and sensitiveness of feeling. When
Governor Denison visited Mount Vernon in
Southern Tasmania, the estate of Captain
Anthony Fenn Kemp* formerly of the Rum-
selling Corps, he complimented the veteran on his
haleness and sprightliness. “ You must have
come of good stock, Captain, to be as vigorous to-
day as you are after having done the work you
did in the early days.” “\es, your Excellency,”
was the old hero’s complacent reply, “of good
stock, and of a good class of men. We officers in
the early times had to be strong, good, all-round
men or the pris’ners would have got the upper
hand.”
Yes, good and strong men were the “ Assigned
Masters ” in the dear, early days. Only—you have
to be careful in defining what meaning you
attach to the adjectives.
* # *
Now, Andrew Webster, of Cambridge-
street, in the nameless region of The Rocks, was
not a good and strong man after the Kemp defini-
tion. He was not a Pure Merino; he was only a
lower-class Emancipist— sent out for nothing less
than being a rank Republican and a believer in
Tom Paine. And he was not very wealthy, for,
unlike Macarthur and Kemp, Johnstone and Blax-
cell, Parson Marsden and Blaxland, he had not
traded in rum. He accumulated no more than
half-a-dozen or so cottages in Cambridge-street,
Essex Lane, and Harrington-street, besides his
own bakehouse—it is still standing in the first-
named thoroughfare—and the bricks of these
erections he had cemented, not with human tears
and the gory dew dropped by the lash, but with
the honest sweat of hard labour. Consequently,
being this negative sort of person, and possessing
a soul (notwithstanding his sentence of transpor-
tation) as white as the best “firsts” flour milled
on Windmill Ridge, he was a kind—nay, a loving
—master to his assigned hands.
He had three —two men and a woman—or,
rather, girl. The girl—an infanticide—served in
the shop and kept the books; and the men did
the bakehouse work. What bread was delivered
he delivered himself. It was hard work, for he
was getting up in years, but he chose it in prefer-
ence to sending his men abroad. “They be oot
o’ temptation in the hoose, they puir deevils ! ”
* Captain Kemp had once dined with Washington, and
called his Tasmanian Estate “Mount Vernon,” after the
ancestral home of the Washingtons.
he would say to Becky Callender. “ Wiles they
be oot in th’ streets, they’re just in th’ way o’ th’
domned rum!’’ And lie laboured and slaved
with his basket in the hot sun or in the cold, wet
rain to save his men from the drink.
Undoubtedly a very weak man was Andy.
# # #
His weakness, however, concerned nobody
but himself and his servants till he died. Then it
was found that the effects of his silly method of
treating the latter survived him. Weakness has a
like immortality with evil. It lives after the
interment of the bones.
For, when his will (drawn by Mr. Pounce,
writing clerkjf was read, and Captain John Piper
and Mr. Robert Campbell (secundus), the execu-
tors, came into formal possession of the estate,
they discovered that Peter Anderson, per Hpeke,
and David Cameron, per England, were left equal
interest in the business and property, conditional
on one or the other of them marrying Becky
Callender, to whom was bequeathed the third
portion of the estate. Becky was to make her
choice which man she would have. If she refused
to marry either, then her portion was to be
divided between the men, and should, on the
other hand, the chosen one refuse to espouse
Becky, then his share was to be handed over to
his, presumably, Jess fastidious comrade. It was
a strange will, and a weak one, but particularly
strange and weak in this : It quite overlooked the
fact that, under the law of the time, not one of
the legatees could inherit. None of them had
undergone a term of servitude sufficiently
long to entitle him or her to a ticket-
of-leave, and consequently they were debarred
from holding property. Poor, silly Andy had
calculated upon living till after his “ Government
people” had obtained their conditional freedom
at least.
* • *
Of course, the assigned hands ■were not
present when the will was first read. Captain
Piper, as soon as he heard of the old man’s death,
came to the house, knowing that he had been
selected as one of the executors. Finding the
document easily, he perceived by his first glance
that he was appointed in conjunction with Mr,
Robert Campbell (the second) —there were three
Campbells—to administer the estate. Accordingly,
he lost not a moment in assuming responsibility.
He called the Government hands together.
“ Now, are you pris’ners or are you free, or have
you tickets ?”
The men pulled tbeir forelocks and the woman
curtsied. Pete Anderson answered for all.
“ We’re servin’yet, your Honor. But —”
“ When are you due for tickets? Answer my
questions, and don’t speak without being spoken
to!”
“ In a year, I’m due,” said Peter.
“In two years, for me, your Honor,” said
Cameron.
“In eighteen months, your Worship, I’ll see my
time out, but the poor master—” The woman
sobbed.
“ Never mind the poor master !” mimicked the
Naval Officer J —he was still Naval Officer, for
the heavy deficiency in his accounts had not yet
been detected. “ You’re due in eighteen months,
are you?”
“Yes, sir !” Becky’s response was sullen now,
and the practised nose of the interlocutor scented
f See Tales of Old Sydney; “Mr. Pounce, Writer and
Forger,” “Mr. Pounce’s Busy Day,” “Mr. Pounce’s
Reprieve,” &c.
fThe Naval Officer was Collector of Customs. \
the incipient insubordination.
“ Yes, sir. If you don’t answer more civilly,
my lass, you go straight to the Factory, instead
of being kept on here till things are settled,
Eighteen months, is it ?”
“ Yes, sir.” This time the response was re-
spectful enough. But it was tearful, for the girl
remembered the familiar “ My lass!” of the simple
old man who was dead, and his constant assurance
that “ Ye’ll no go back to the Fawktoree, my lass,
never !” sounded painfully in her ears.
“ Ah, you can be civil, can ye? I see what ’tis
—old Andrew spoilt ye ! And ye think ye can
play upon me, d’ye? But ye won’t—none o’ye,
so I tell ye. Now, ’way with ye to the back-room
till I see what’s to be done with ye.”
To the back-room old Andy's “ Government
people’’went, but they had no sooner reached it
than they heard the Honorable the Naval Officer
spluttering in wild anger at the facts disclosed in
other sentences of the baker’s Last Testament,
“ Left everything to his Government people—to
his friends, Peter Anderson, David Campbell,
Rebecca Callender ! Outrageous ! Never heard
of such a thing—the man was mad—they coerced
him—twenty pounds a-piece to Robert Campbell
and me for mourning rings ! Good God ! ” So
they heard him go on in his indignation, hardly
breathing themselves as they grasped the astound-
ing intelligence. Could it be true ? Surely it was
too good ! Kind as the old man had been, he
could surely not have gone the length of bequeath-
ing them his property? Surely not, surely not !
Then the storm burst out again. “ Here, ye
wretches, come here ! Come here, ye jade,
Callender, and bring your brother-rogues with ye!
Come here, I say !” The Sydney Gazette more
than once applaudingly referred to Captain Piper
as “a Finished Gentleman of the Old School.”
The imagination recoils from the task of picturing
what he would have been in the rough.
“ Here, ye rascals ! What devil’s game have ye
been up to with that fool, Webster? What d’ye
mean by making him leave all his property to ye
in this mad way ?”
The “Government-men” and the “Govern-
ment-woman” looked at each other wonderingly.
Then, after all, they had not misunderstood what
they had heard? All—poor creatures!—experi-
enced that intense revulsion of feeling which
comes with the rescue of the despairing soul from
the abysses of degradation and its sudden planting
upon the heights of prosperity. But, in the tem-
pest of their emotions, they forgot to do one thing
—to answer the Naval Officer.
“ No answer !” cried that Finished Gentleman,
“ByG , I’ll make ye suffer for your inso-
lence ! It’s 20 a-piece I’ll give you ! ”
Down again from the heights of prosperity fell
the poor wretches. The Naval Officer was a man
of his word in such particulars. And the men
knew it. _
“ Twenty, sir ! We hadn’t time to answer, sir !
We didn’t know what you were meanin’, sir !”
“No, sir!” piteously echoed Callender. “An’
you wouldn’t give me—a woman, sir—twenty ? ”
The girl had been partially protected from under-
standing to what lengths the authorities of Old
Sydney would go—and she was not certain
that the day in which women were flogged in
Sydney had quite gone by.
“Urn! Ah! No —l don’t flog women—but these
men’ll take your dose betwixt ’em, and serve ’em
right for putting ye up to insolence. Thirty
a-piece ye get, an’ be damned to ye! Here,
Orderly! ” ,
The Orderly-constable who represented one of
Captain Piper’s privileges entered from the foot-
path on which he was standing, and saluting
waited his master’s orders,
“Orderly, take these men to the Barracks with
this note, and bring ’em back when punished
D’ye hear ? ”
“ Yes, sir ! ”
“ And Orderly, if either o’the men can’t come
back, tell the Barrack-master that he’s to go into
hospital! D’ye hear ? ”
Of course, he heard. Billet men as a rule were
remarkably quick of hearing when the voice
which was speaking was that of a finished gentle-
man of the Naval Officer’s stamp. And, hearing
the orderly, of course, was equally quick to obey.’
He took the note which Captain Piper handed to
him, and which authorised Barrack-master
Scraggo to summarily chastise Anderson and
Cameron. The days of Governor Bourke were
not yet, and “parlor” courts were still held daily
in old Sydney. As the men were moving dazedly
to the door to pass out for their punishment, the
gh'l Callender turned from the table by which she
had been standing and flung herself before Piper,
011 her knees.
“Oh, mister! Oh, sir, don’t beat the poor
fellows ! The poor master wouldn’t have ’em
beat at all. He said as the cat wur awful, and
ruined a man body an’ soul for ever an’ ever!
An’ they’re good fellows, mister, an’ bar a drop o’
rum, now an’ then, which the poor master
wouldn’t let ’em have, an’ they're ’bedient like,
an ’ mister, we were all struck o’ a heap wi’ the

“Orderly ! ” interrupted Captain Piper, “if y oll
don’t take these men promptly, I’ll see what
your own back is made of ! ”
“ Wur ye born of a wolf or a woman, Cap’n ? ”
asked the “ female hand ” between her sobs.
* # *
It was but a step from the bakery to the
Barrack-square, but it was a sufficiently long dis-
tance for the two Government-men, Anderson
and Cameron, to come to a sense of their position,
Anderson was the first to realise it.
“ Ord’Jy !” he asked, “ may I have a quiet word
with yon chap, Davie? I’ll make it wuth your
while !”
The orderly looked round. Nobody was within
hearing except a dirty, draggle-tail of a woman,
“ It’s agin rules for pris’ners under punishment
to speak to one ’nuther. What’ve you got ?”
Anderson pulled from his pocket some paper
currency—shilling and sixpenny notes—and hold
the lot towards the constable.
“ Just for twelve words, Ord’ly !” The orderly
looked round again. The coast was still clear and
he accepted the bribe, stepping back a couple of
paces to allow the men to come together,
Anderson stooped and whispered. “ Davie,
I’m away, man, for a bolt! I’m goin’ to Pounce
—he’ll not see us done out of the prop’ty ! Do you
keep the slop busy !”
Cameron listened, but could hardly take in the
force of the words before Anderson had started
running. They were passing by Charlotte Place
corner, about the last spot in the city which a
sane man would select as the scene of an escapade,
for though the Rocks, with their countless hiding-
places, were but a few hundred yards away, dis-
reputable inhabitants would think twice before
receiving a refugee in broad daylight, inasmuch
as a proceeding of the kind would have provoked
a general raid by the authorities. If the Rocks
were not aimed at by the bolter he would have to
fly into the heart of the town past the wateh-
house, in front of which were usually grouped
some lower-class constables, or else run the gaunt-

let of the sentries at the Military Barracks.
Perhaps, had Anderson thought of these things
and calculated his chances, he would have con-
sidered the odds too great against escape and
would not have risked it. But he gave himself no
time to think. The notion of bolting had no
sooner entered his head than he resolved to make
the attempt. He only waited to communicate his
plan to Cameron, so that the latter should not
think he was deserting him.
It was the Orderly’s turn to be stupefied now.
He stood still for half-a-minute, so surprised was
he, and then started in pursuit of the escapee,
who, by that time, had covered half the distance
to George-street. Then the constable recollected
that he had one other prisoner, in charge, and
returned to Cameron’s side and grasped his arm as
though to make sure of one at least. One man
tight in hand was worth two running away, he
thought, as he raised the hue-and-cry. He sent
the shout up ;“ A bolter! a bolter! Have him
there; have him there I A bolter !” But it was
too late. The Government man had reached
George-street, and, once there, was collected
enough to stop running and to mingle, with ap-
parent unconcern, in the crowd which thronged
the leading thoroughfare. He was careful, how-
ever, to walk away from the Barracks and not
towards them. The Orderly-constable saw him
no more that day, nor for many days.
* * *
Life in Old Sydney was not without its
humorous side. “There was plenty of weeping
in those days,” used to say Judge Roger Therry,
“ but there was .also plenty of laughter. ” Seriously
as the day had began for assigned servant David
Cameron, and bitter though the pain which it was
to bring him, it would not reach its close without
also bringing the laugh to his face.
As the two men entered the Barrack-yard, a
group were just leaving the triangles. Unto the
most prominent of the group the Orderly-con-
stable presented his one prisoner and the note. '
“ Why does Captain Piper not send his coves
for punishment earlier? Does he think we can
keep the triangles going all day for his conveni-
ence?” grumbled Barrack-master Scragge, glan-
cing over the note, and then tearing it into frag-
ments which he.threw ter the wind-currpnt. Flog-
gings were so frequent, nobody troubled much
about preserving the orders by whioh they were
inflicted.
“ Please, sir ” began the Orderly, anxious to
explain about the bolt.*
“ Hold your tongue, sir. And, now, both of
you strip.”
“Me, sir!” exclaimed the Orderly. “I
brought this man for punishment! ”
“ I don’t say you didn’t! But you also brought
yourself, didn’t you? Come, none of your
nonsense. Get ready there, Seourger! ”
“ But, sir—Mr. Scragge—sir ”
“ I’ll give you ten more for myself, if you delay
much longer, my flash joker.§ The naval officer’s
order saidf ‘ Two men. Give these two men thirty
a-piece !’ That’s what the Captain wrote.”
“ Yes, sir—l mean, sir—l don’t say he didn’t,
sir——”
“ Better not, indeed. Now strip !”
“ But,” said the fellow, frightened to the point
of desperation, “ I had two pris’ners, but one has
bolted. It v»as him, sir, who was to get it,”
“Ho, hof” laughed Mr. Scragge. “That’s
your game, is it? One’s bolted, has he? And,
pray, who’s bolted—what’s his name ?”
But the Orderly-constable, having had no pre-
vious knowledge of old Andrew’s assigned men,
and not having heard their names mentioned,
could not inform the Barrack-master of the
absconder’s name.
“ I don’t —know, sir. He was delivered tome
with this ’un, sir—an’he bolted, sir—an’ I thought
as it was best to bring this ’ere ’un along’”
“ You don’t know. That’s a likely yarn.”
“ ’Tis true, sir. S’elp me, ’tis true. Ax this
pris’ner, sir, if ’tain’t.”
The Barrack-master turned to Cameron. If he
corroborated the Orderly’s story—well, it might
be true; and, again, it might not. It was not
the first time within Mr, B. M. Scragge’s experi-
ence that a convict-constable had brought an
order for his own back to be striped, and had tried
to evade punishment by declaring that the order
was intended for some other prisoner’s benefit —
and back. Consequently Mr. Scragge felt he had
a right to be careful. That was the worst of the
loose system, he was accustomed to say, of a Justice
or Superior Officer sending in men to be flogged
without going to the trouble of making out a
formal warrant —he could never be sure that the
man for whom the punishment was intended
always got it! He used to be tenderly respectful
over this'part of the System, used Mr. Scragge,
and so not to do a thing too rashly, he interro-
gated the prisoner.
“You pris’ner, there ! Is this constable telling
the truth ? ”
Cameron was never very keen-witted, but he
saw how useful a lie on his part would be to
Pete Anderson’s policy, whatever it was, as it
would occasion delay in his pursuit. So he slowly
responded, his natural hesitation being taken by
Scragge as an indication of reluctance in testify-
ing against an officer of the law, “ No, sir—he
ain’t! Me and him were to be flogged, sir ! ”
And so, in spite of his continued protestations
and of his promise that dire vengeance would fall
upon everybody, upon Scragge, and the seourger,
and Cameron, once Captain Piper was made aware
of the indignity which had been heaped upon his
trusted emissary,, the Orderly-constable received
the 30 lashes originally designed to scarify Pete
Anderson’s back.
How Cameron laughed between his tears and
groans ! ’And how merrily the new five-pronged
cat —the Sydney Barracks in the Late Twenties
favoured the employment of the “five-tails,” in
preference to the nine, holding that as much
execution was inflicted by the former as by the
latter, because the nine clogged so readily—fell
upon the Orderly’s skin ! For the seourger shared
the general dislike with which the “ Government-
men ” regarded the convict-constables.
« • •
This, however, is a mere incident of our
story, and we must hurry after Anderson.
That ingenious sinner, who, was being flogged
by proxy, passed along George-street to the wharf-
side and into the back-way of the Hog and
Whistle public-house. This was a place of call for
assigned hands and newly emancipated men, and
was kept by a fellow who had long been free, and
who, by the sale of more or less ‘ * uncustomed ”
rum, and by acting as surreptitious agent in the
thousand and one more or less nefarious trans-
actions to which his patrons were parties, was on
the high-road to attaining the object of his
ambition—the founding of “ a landed family,”
“ Ah, Mr. Anderson ! ’’was mine host’s saluta-
tion, “so you’ve lost old Andrew? Good man,
Andy ! Me an’ him was second fleeters, was in
the same vessel together, an’ same mess—the only
two of our mess who was landed ’live ! ”
“Yes, Mr. Smith! An’ what d’ye think?
Andy has left hia business and prop’ty to me an’
his other Gov’ment pe’ple, an’ that Piper is
goin’ to rob us of it! I’ve bolted, an’ I wants you
to hide me ! ”
“Never!” exclaimed the landlord ! “An’ o’
corse I’ll ’ide ye! An’ I’ll ’elp ye to get yer
rights.”
“ I knows ye would, Mr. Smith, an’ that’s why
I came to ye.” And then Anderson related the
circumstances which had led to his escape, and
his determination to interview Pounce —Pounce,
the writer—and forger—who was virtually the
legal (and illegal) adviser of transports still under
servitude, and of the lower-class Emancipists and
“ conditionally-freed.”
“I thought as ye’d see as Pounce dealt fairly
with me, Mr. Smith, an’ ’tisn’t for me and Dave
as I wish to get the prop’ty, though, of course, it
would be nice for us both, but I’rn out of it ’cos of
the bolt. But it’s for Becky—Becky Callender !
I won’t let her be robbed if I can help it. An’ if
I help her, she’ll do the fair thing by me and
Dave by-and-bye.”
“Was ye a-going’ ter marry’er?” questioned
the publican.
“Dave an’ me didn’t ha’ no time to think of
that. But it don’t matter now—l’m out of it.
But ye’ll send for Pounce, an’ ’ll see he doesn’t
swindle us. He’s a dab at swindlin’ every’un, is
Pounce!”
In reply, Mr. Smith complacently assured An-
derson that though Mr. Pounce might swindle
others, he would not dare to cheat him. “’Tis
as much as ’is neck’s worth. ’E don’t play no
snide game wi’ me. W’y, luk ’ere, Pete. ’Ere’s
’is lettei-s awaitin’ im !” He withdrew from his
pocket and threw on the table a dozen or fifteen
letters addressed to different names or initials, all
in care of the Hog and Whistle, “ I’ve
jest ter ’and these ’ere scrawlies ter the coppers
an’w’ere ’ud Mr. Pounce be? W’y, in George-
street jug, awaitin’ ter be turned orf! Mr. Pounce
don’t play skevare wi’ many, but he does w’ me,
so make yer min’ easy, Pete ! If Pounce can do
enythink, ’e’ll do it fur me !”
* * #
That Mr. Smith’s confidence was not mis-
placed may be judged from the conversation which
occurred between Captain Piper and Mr. Robert
Campbell the Second on the one part, and Mr.
Timothy Pounce on the other, on the morning
following the day whose eventful happenings we
have related. The former gentlemen—Mr. Pounce
was quite the gentleman, too—were engaged in
perusing the defunct Webster's account-books and
few papers in the sitting-room behind the shop,
when Pounce entered, looking as though whatso-
ever things were good and honest and pure, these
things were in his exclusive possession.
“ Good morning, gentlemen ! I devoutly hope I
see you well this beautiful day !” was the old
scoundrel’s unctuous greeting.
“ ’Morning, Pounce. And what d’ you want ?”
was Mr. Campbell’s response. The Naval Officer,
who was a great hand at accounts —he would have
shone in these latter days as a director of an
investment society—was too intent upon adding
up a list of outstanding debts to notice the salute.
“A leetle business, gentlemen—only a leetle
business connected with our unfortunate friend’s
estate !”
“ What is it —a claim? Claims against will be
asked for by advertisement.”
“It is—h’m, ah—not exactly a claim, Mr.
Campbell, but—ah—the matter of our dead friend’s
will.”
The Captain looked up now. “Yes?” he de-
manded sharply. “ And what have you got to say
about Webster’s will?”
“ Not very much, air, but only that I’ve—l’ve
my poor friend’s will in my possession. I little
thought—when—when I was drawing it only a
fortnight ago—he would be so soon taken from
us ! ” Now the venerable old man applied his
pocket-handkerchief to his eyes to wipe away the
rising tear. Also, that he might enjoy without
detection the confusion into which he had thrown
the other gentlemen.
“ Will—a fortnight ago!” Captain Piper
snatched at a foolscap document lying on the
table, and glanced at the date. “ What the devil
are you speaking about.- sir? Here’s Webster’s
will.”
Mr. Pounce dried his eyes carefully, and then
with an appropriate slowness of movement, untied
a package which he pulled from his tail-pocket.
“Ah, gentlemen, that must have been one of
the earlier wills—l have drawn several for the
dear old man—he used to change his intention
every three months or so—ah, how I shall miss
him ! ” He stopped to wipe his eyes once more.
“ Stop that nonsense, and say what you’ve
got to say, Pounce ! ” roared the impetuous Piper.
“There’s some more of your devil’s dodgery at the
bottom of this, I’ll swear ! ”
These words aggrieved Mr. Pounce, angered
him. That he should be so insulted ! he a man
whom notwithstanding that the law had dealt
unfairly with him, was living as good and honest
a life as—well, as any one in Sydney ! He was a
free man now—in the enjoyment of His Most
Gracious Majesty’s—may God bless and preserve
him !—Conditional Pardon—and he would not
stop to be insulted! He would take advice, he
would, as to the legal liability of any person,
official or not, who accused him of dodgery. And
if his Honor the Naval Officer accused him of im-
proper conduct, why did he not lay an informa-
tion in due legal course? So he went on, a
righteous wrath lending fire to his words, and he
proceeded to wrap up his papers again.
“ Oh, come,” said Campbell, “ his Honor didn’t
mean all you think, Pounce. You must say ’tis
strange that this other will should be forthcoming
—if ’tis a will which we have yet to see !”
“ Yes —strange !” echoed Captain Piper, who
was not willing to back down before an Emanci-
pist, whom everyone believed to be as expert a
forger now as he was before his “coming out.”
“ Very strange that old Floury should have kept
his second last will and not his last one ! So
strange that I tell ye, Pounce, I don’t believe he
did anything of the kind !”
“ Very well, sir. I thought as soon as I heard
of the old gentleman’s death it was my duty to
communicate with the persons named in the will
in my -possession as executors. And how was 1
to know you had found another will, sirs ?”
“ Who are the executors of the will you hold?”
Mr. Campbell put the question.
“ Why, you are, sir, and the Captain. The
Captain does not do me the honour to trust
me, sir, but I may as well assure you that when
Mr. Webster consulted me about his will—he
consulted me constantly, gentlemen—then I always
told him he could make no better choice of execu-
tors than you, gentlemen ! Believe that 1 I make
the statement upon honour, sirs! ” And the noble
magnanimous fellow looked the injured innocent
he was so far from being.
His hearers did not believe him, of course, but
still after the delicate compliment he had paid
them they could do nothing else than adopt a
more civil tohe towards the scrivener, and the
Captain, mollified by learning that he had not
been displaced as executor, asked for the Will in
the most conciliatory manner possible to him.
“Certainly, gentlemen, that is my mission here
to deliver the document over to your keeping.

Herr Hassmussen, 547. George Street (near . Liverpool St.-), Sydney.
You will, of course, have no objection to give me
. a leeeipt for it?’
“ We’ll give you a receipt, Mr. Pounce,'for a
document purporting to be the Last Will and
Testament of Andrew Webster, deceased ! ” said
the Captain. There was a nasty sting in the
emphasis which the speaker laid upon “purport-
ing ” that made Pounce wince for a moment, and
possibly, if he could then have safely withdrawn
with the document, he would have done so. But
second thoughts reminded him that he had gone
too far now in the matter, and that his best game
was to brazen it out.
“As you please, Captain Piper. You’ll be sorry
I’m sure upon further reflection, for insinuating—
but never mind, never mind ! 1 have the clearest
conscience upon this matter, sir, as indeed upon
all othei's. Here is the will.”
As he spoke he handed the document to the
Captain, who eagerly grasped and unfolded it.
It was brief and to the point, and a moment’s
reading sufficed for its significance to be impressed
upon his mind.
“ Ha, ha !” He actually laughed at the thought
of how unnecessary his anxiety had been. “ Why,
Pounce, even if the old man didn’t know that a
transport still under servitude couldn’t inherit, ye
might have told him that much, man ! I’ve
heard ye’re as good as a lawyer, Pounce, but your
advice is not worth much if ye didn’t know that!”
“But Ido know it, sir! And I told Mr.
Webster so.”
“ Well, then, ye must know, ye fool, if ye ain't
a rogue, that this will, which I for one am quite
prepared to admit as genuine, now I’ve seen it—
don’t ye, too, Campbell? Look, here’s the old
man’s signature . ”
“You do admit it as genuine, begging your
pardon for interrupting, sir ? Didn’t I say you’d
be sorry before long, sir ?” There was an eager-
ness in Pounce’s voice which amounted to an in-
discreet revelation, but, fortunately for him, it
passed unnoticed by the other men, who were
intently studying the document.
“ Yes, the thing’s genuine enough—at least, it
appears so!” said Campbell, more cautious than
his co-executor.
“ But why am I a fool or a rogue, may I ask ?”
pursued Pounce.
“ Because ye knew that no bond person can
inherit, and ye let the old man leave his property
to a bond person—his assigned woman, Callender
—ye must have known the will was not worth the
paper on which it was written !”
“ I did know it, Captain Piper. And I did
tell our dear friend, Mr. Webster, so. And, as
he would have it so—that is, as he would leave
the property to no one else but his servant,
Rebecca Callender, I advised him ” He
paused. He always liked to roll his tongue over
a morsel of revenge, did Pounce.
“ Advised what, sir?” thundered Piper.
“That he should —instantly employ all his
influence—he had strong influence, gentlemen, in
official circles, as you perhaps know—you will
find evidences of that among his accounts and
papers in the shape of bonds and promissory
notes ” He paused again to look straight into
the Captain's eyes.
“Go on, sir !” The Naval Officer’s voice was
less muscular this time. “What did you advise
him ?”
“ To bring pressure to bear, gentlemen —to gain
the girl ’’
“ What, what ?” demanded the Captain.
“Her freedom, sir. And I’m happy—very
happy to say, gentlemen, that it’s just been
granted! Miss Rebecca Callender can inherit.
To-morrow’s Gazette, as I’m informed, gentle-
men, will contain her name in the list of Con-
ditionally Pardoned ! ”
* * *
It was a nice point, whether a transport
could inherit when he or she only became free
after the death of the testator; but before probate
had been granted, Chief Justice Forbes settled it
satisfactorily to the wishes of the ’Mancipist and
Ticket-of-leave party, and to the discomfiture of
the Crown authorities who were inspired by the
executors. The Judge decided that as the pro-
visions of the will could not take effect till after
probate, Rebecca Callender, recently conditionally
pardoned, must be recognised as heiress to the
estate.
Before, however, the executors took the case
into court on this point, they had tested the
authenticity of the second will. But here, too,
they had been foiled. Mr. Pounce swore posi-
tively to receiving instructions from the testator a
fortnight before his death—and who so likely to
draw up the last will and testament as the man
who had drawn up previous ones? Then the
witnesses to the later will —John Smith, publican,
and Peter Anderson, assigned servant, were
precise and consistent in their recollection of the
circumstances under which they were called in to
witness the old man’s signature. Who, again,
were so likely to be asked to attest as the old
man’s former ship-mate, and present “ first hand ?”
And did not Anderson, still an absconder, when
advertised for, come forward from his liiding-
place—the parties who supported the later Will
could have found him, however, without bold ad-
vertisement ! —to declare the genuineness of his
signature, though he must have known he was
rendering himself liable to severe punishment for
his “bolt,” and escape from a merited flogging?
Surely, no stronger proof could be desired than
that of the hond-Hdes of his share in the docu-
ment ! It was not, his Honor said, as if the
witness Anderson would benefit under the second
Will. His interest, if he had any at all, lay in
supporting the former Will. All the good he
could derive from his evidence in favour of the
later document was the arrears of his punishment
of 30 lashes —Piper, moved by his Orderly’s story,
took care that Anderson didn’t evade the stripes
a second time—and 12 months in the chain-gang
for absconding. No —repeated his Honour, if
there was ever a disinterested witness, it was the
prisoner Anderson ! And so the later Will was
upheld.
Altogether (as an entry in Mr, Pounce’s
diary testifies) this forgery feat was one of
those of which he was proudest. It was so
completely successful in all its issues! And
chiefest feather in his cap he complimented him-
self upon the idea of leaving in the forged Will
the whole property to Rebecca. It was so easy to
get a woman’s pardon through the offices and into
the Gazette. It was the easiest thing—but to
rush through two male pardons as well would have
been impossible. Not that Becky permitted her
former fellow-servants to suffer. How she re-
warded them, how she remunerated Pounce, and,
above all, how she made Captain Piper pay his
promissory-note for £5OO which he had given to
Webster, for money advanced, we will tell you
some other day.
But as to the recompense Mr. “John Smith,”
the esteemed host of the Hog and Whistle,
received for his kindly aid in proving—and
forging—Andy Webster’s Last Will and Testa-
ment, we may here remark that it enabled him to
complete the purchase of the first of the noble
estates which, on the proper page of “Burke’s
Colonial Gentry,” you will find alluded to as the
possessions of his descendants. Becky, yon see,
was badly trained. Having been unfortunate
enough, according to the old-school notions, to be
under a weak employer, she had not learnt to be
ungenerous or unkind.

What a weary thing it is to be ill, especially for a
long time. You are tired of advice, tired of try-
ing this, that, and the other, tired of fancying you
are a trifle _ better, tired of taking precautions
against getting worse. You are tired of pain, and
half believe the sooner you are under the ground
the better for you, and the more agreeable to your
friends.
Here’s a little story. A woman told it lately.
She says ;
[Copy.]
t_ L Mary Jones, of 3, Gal ton-street, Great
Howard-street, Liverpool, declare as follows :
“I have suffered all my life from weakness of
the stomach and sluggish liver. I was always
tired and languid, and often troubled with bilious
headache. My appetite was poor. I never had
desire for food, and what I did eat did not digest
properly. I had always a bad taste in my mouth,
and a slimy scum would cover my mouth and
teeth, and so bad was this that I was obliged to
rinse it away before eating. When I was in my
teens I was very weakly and would faint after
sitting down to my meals. I had trembling at
the heart, with a heavy weight at the chest, pain
at ray side, and a strange giddy feeling would
come over me. When out walking in the street I
used to have to stand and rest for fear of falling.
I was also so weak that when going about my
work I often had to sit down and rest. At times
I had a bad cough and pain in my lungs. I saw
doctor after doctor, and was under medical treat-
ment for more than twelve years. One doctor
said I was suffering from an enlargement on the
liver, another said I had heart disease, a third
said my lungs were congested and that I could not
recover. Thinking I was now in a consumption,
I went to a consumptive hospital and was under
treatment there for some time. The doctors, after
sounding my chest, told me I was in a decline,
and that my left lung was congested. They gave
me cod-liver oil and other medicines, but I got no
better.
“ In July. 18£0, after a bad fainting, I became
so bad I had to take to my bed, and was attended
by three doctors for a month. The first doctor
who saw me said I could not recover. I had
intense pains in my stomach, and could get
nothing to pass my bowels. Various means were
tried and found useless. I could take liquid food
only, and was fast sinking, my case being con-
sidered hopeless by both the physician and the
nurse. At this time it was that my husband
heard through Mr. Parry, the chemist in Great
Howard-street, of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and we were presented
with a book which described a case just like mine
having been cured by it. My husband procured
a bottle of this medicine and I began taking it.
After a few doses I passed a motion as black as
coal and experienced great relief, and shortly after
felt as if I wanted something to eat. When the
doctor called the next day he could see a mark*!
change in me and said, ‘Mrs. Jones, we hav>j
given you the right medicine at last.’ He thought
it was his last bottle that had worked the change,
whereas the nurse had put the medicine in the
cupboard untouched. I went on with Mother
Seigel’s Syrup, and to the delight of my husband,
father, and nurse I never looked behind me. All
the pain at the heart and chest gradually left me,
and in a fortnight I was strong enough to be
removed to the seaside, and have ever since been
in good health.
“ I never felt so well in my life as I do now.
All my friends consider the cure as a miraculous
one, and I wish others to know by what means
my life was saved. I am willing that Messrs. A,
J. White, Limited, shall make whatever use thev
may think fit of this statement, and I hereby
authorise them to do so.
“ Dated this 3rd April, 1891,
“ (Si gn ed) Mrs. Mary J ones. ’ ’
There was nothing “miraculous” about this
lady’s recovery, although it may have been, and
indeed it was, remarkable. But it was all along
the straight lines of nature. She had suffered all
her life from indigestion and dyspepsia, and her
other ailments arose from that, and that alone.
She could not digest her food, and the whole sys-
tem was perishing from the poison in the stomach
and from lack of nutrition. Mother Siegel’s
Syrup did its one work : it cleansed away the cor-
rupted matter and set the digestive organs (the
liver, stomach, and bowels) in natural operation,
and immediate improvement and final recovery
followed as necessary consequences.
Especially should the reader notice the close
resemblance between the symptoms of dyspepsia
and those of consumption, through which most
unhappy mistakes are constantly made. Never
conclude you have consumption until you are sure
it isn’t dyspepsia. The chances are that* the
results will be the same as in Mrs. Jones’ case.

The “insulting behaviour” clause in
Victorian police law is, after all, not such an awful
Damoclean sword over the head of every undis-
tinguished citizen as the “suspected person”
charge, which may fall upon him when he is as
quiet and undemonstrative as a corpse. For
example, six young men were hustled into Mel-
bourne City Court, the other morning, to receive
sentence for being suspected persons amongst the
naval procession onlookers. Four of them, having
previously become ‘ ‘ known to the police,” received
a few months apiece in order, apparently, that the
police may know them better next time. Two of
the culprits, however, had committed their first
offence in getting themselves suspected by those
enlightened guardians of the peace. In point of
fact they had actually done nothing to justify
suspicion,_ or to prove that they were not more
pure and innocent than the best policeman living.
The statutes contained no scale of imprisonments
for this fortunate couple, so they were released —on
finding three months’ sureties for their good
behaviour ! The question naturally arises, why
isn’t every man Jack in Melbourne bound'over to
keep the peace every quarter day ? And how can
a man be innocent until proved guilty, when he is
always subject to police suspicion?

SWORN CERTIFICATE.— One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. / consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time look a great
<lUantitg of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse everyday, wasting away until
I became a- perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of yom" professional skill J consulted you, -find
you told me yon could cure - me for a given sum. I agreed
and Went under your treatment in March last. At the
er,d of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fes-ional skill, I am as well as ever.

Apropos of Chambers’ Encyclopedia
blunder as to Peutridge and Coburg (Vic.), some
of the Pentridgeites were desirous of re-calling
the village “ Merriville,” from the Merri Creek.
•Marcus Clarke killed that idea by asking them
bow would they like to be spoken of as Merri-
vijlaihs? But ’twixt Merrivillains and Co-burglars
there isn’t much choice.
-An old-time coincidence was the deter-
mination of a Victorian Royal Commission to
erect the Beechworth Lunatic Asylum at the head
of a gully which was unnamed on the district-
surveyor’s map. After the foundations of the
building were in, it was found that some early
prospectors had called the ravine “ Madman’s
Gully,” from the circumstance that one of their
party, who had gone off his head, had died there.
It seems impossible for the English pic-
torials to exist without grovelling. The Illus-
trated London News and Graphic get a large
proportion of their subjects from the Royal
Family, whose every idiotic “function” is a job
for some special artist. The Benny Illustrated
Paper plays the same game, for the benefit of the
“submerged tenth,” no doubt, in an even more
nauseous way. Illustrations in a recent number
of this poisonous rag are entitled “His Imperial
Majesty William III., Britain’s Welcome Guest,”
“The Empress of Germany, Our Coming Guest,”
“The Forthcoming Royal Bride and the Princely
Bridegroom,” and “The Bride the Queen
Honoured (Alberta Victoria Ponsonby).” Ugh !
Edwin Harrow, an old Maoriland identity,
called a meeting of his creditors the other day,
owing to hard times, volcanic eruptions, and other
misfortunes. He announced himself as the
“honest pauper of Takapuna.” Before the pro-
ceedings commenced the principal creditor said
grace: “For what we are about to receive may
the Lord make lis truly thankful; ” and the next
largest creditor added fervently : “Blessed is he
that exoecteth nothing, for he shall not be dis-
appointed.” Then the debtor presented the
chairman with a bouquet, and the chairman said
it was a pleasure to meet an insolvent of Mr.
Harrow’s description. Next there were three
cheers. The bankrupt then explained that he was
a lonely and disappointed man with one son, and
that son was a monkey, and that monkey was
dead. Great emotion among the audience. His
forefathers, he added, had fought at Hastings.
Then he read a long extract from the prayer-book
beginning : “ Dearly beloved brethren, the
scripture moveth us in sundry places.” Somebody
got up at this juncture, and proposed that if Mr.
Harrow would get married the creditors should
give him a clean receipt all round. This was
agreed to unanimously, and the insolvent started
to make some further observations about his son
Jeremiah who was a monkey, but he was gently
shoved out, and started away down the street —
presumably on the road bacx, to his lonely
hermitage by Lake Takapuna.

The Kangaroo.
Dear Bulletin’,—Sydney Echo lately awakened to the
fact that the kangaroo (macropus major) is a valuable
animal, and states in a recent issue (Aug. 24) that “ some
. . . step will have to be taken, and that soon, if we
are not to see the kangaroo become an extinct animal.”
Now this sounds well, but it is extremely disappointing to
me to find that the Echo has taken its cue and derived its
inspiration from “an interesting letter written to the
Melbourne Argus.” lam quite sure it will surprise no
one in N.S.W., except perhaps the Echo, to hear that
during the last ten years I have constantly and consis-
tently advocated the protection of kangaroos in most of
the leading newspapers of the province, and it is more
than probable that the author of the “interesting letter”
who has been so extremely fortunate as to attract
the Echo’s attention is simply using my thunder.
I desire now to remind the Echo that in December, 1888,
I dealt with this subject exhaustively in the Sydney
Morning Herald, a little paper published at the Echo
office, and adduced far more good arguments in favour of
the protection of kangaroos by the State than the author
of the “interesting letter” in the Argus submits even
now ; yet at that time the Echo had nothing to
say in favour of the proposition, and the Sydney Morning
Herald, irt reply to ray arguments, asserted in its leading
columns, with considerable vehemence and questionable
logic, that “ all wild animals must go before the advance
of civilisation,” and in a general way formulated and
laid down the dictum that the kangaroo was of little con-
sequence and its extermination need not cause uneasiness.
Echo, admits now that the kangaroo is too
valuable to be allowed to become extinct; will it
assert that it was any less valuable three years ago?
If “it would be a serious mistake” to permit the exter-
mination of the kangaroos now, as the Echo states it
would be, would not the “mistake” have been equally
“serious” in 1888, when I earnestly and emphatically
drew attention to it ? Setting aside the question of com-
mercial value altogether, we Australians don’t want the
kangaroo to become extinct, simply because it is Austra-
lian. Its saucy, fantastic hop is a menace and-a challenge
to new-churaism, and every whack of its tail on the
ground is an emphatic protest against landlordism, Im-
perialism and foreign titles.—Yours, H. J. M ‘Cooky.—
Cadia, Aug. 29.
It is rumoured by a S.M. Herald cable
that Lydia Manton (mistress of a brother of
Manchester’s dnke), a Gaiety chorus-girl who
suicided lately, was haunted while alive by the
dull and flat-headed Duke of Clarence, the future-
defender of the Faith, that hopeful British heir
presumptive with the superfluous shirt-front and
the overflowing cuffs ; and it seems to be implied
that she died to get rid of him. The papers put
it delicately that she was the “ recipient of atten-
tions ” from the prince, which is another way of
saying that he hypnotised her with his dull and
clammy eye. There is no definite evidence yet to
hand, but the male Guelphs have all had their eye
on some ballet-girl or other ever since they arrived
in Britain—barring George I. who brought over
his own harem of old gorgons and giantesses ; and
if the vacant-faced Clarence wasn’t after this par-
ticular girl then he had better prove an alibi by
showing which girl ho was after at the moment.
And if he can’t produce the other girl then it may
be assumed with some show of reason that he was
in pursuit of this girl, for every Guelph is after
some girl all the time.
A British scientific journal quotes certain
Tasmanian meteorological data, based upon the
observations noted at Fort Arthur penal station
years ago. The journal does not know that the
observatory was in the charge of a convict, who
had not the least scientific knowledge, and, as a
regular thing, the current reports were copied
from the data of previous years ! If unscientific,
the observer was, however, a humorist ; as occa-
sionally he varied the year to year transcript by
repeating in winter the previous summer’s data
Extract from the fearsome wail of “an old
.Shellback ” in the Sydney illustrated Imperial
organ re the arrival of the “ Squadron ”:
On Saturday, the sth ult., one missed the hearty, ring-
ing cheers so often heard in other lands, more particu-
larly in the Old Country, on the occasion of a naval or
military demonstration; and I am sure those in the
crowd who, like myself, witnessed the departure of the
Guards from St. James’ Park in 1854, must have felt
ashamed of the silence that obtained amongst their
fellow-colonists when the cruisers came up to their moor-
ings in Farm Cove.
This is interesting as showing the utter indepen-
dence of Australia to Imperialistic demonstrations
provided by the official classes. And when you
look at it carefully, it amounts to the theory that
a man who saw the Guards in Loudon in 1854 is
morally bound to yell in Australia in 1891; which
is much the same as stating that a person who
saw Parkes out here in 1888 is called upon as a
consequence to have a carbuncle in Africa in
1892. We love the drivelling old “Shellback”
who writes this sort of inconsequential hogwash.
We love him for many things, but chiefly for his
ghastly self-importance, which makes him think
that the whole world should go the way lie wants
it, just because he saw the Guards in 1854. And
we suppose the old man would have a fit of
apoplexy if any one suggested that nobody cares
a straw even if he saw the Janissaries in 1570,
and that it doesn’t make the slightest difference.
David Christie Murray, in the Contem-
porary Review, tells of how much he was im-
pressed by the Eight Honrs’ Procession in Mel-
bourne. He saw the representatives of all the
trades troop past with their banners, and last of
all he saw a waggonette load of grey-bearded men,
labelled, “ The Pioneers.” These he imagined to
be the pioneers, not of the Eight Honrs’ move-
ment, but of Australia. He thought they were
the first explorers of a virgin continent-perhaps
he entertained a wild suspicion that they included
Captain Cook and his ore*-. Anyway, as lie
looked around at the tall buildings, church spires,
cable tramways, and crowds of people, and con-
sidered that the grey-bearded veterans in the
waggonette were the veritable founders of so much
civilisation, a wave of emotion swept across the
“distinguished novelist,” and his great heart
swelled with pride. Silly, old, thickheaded Crusty
Murray ! Between the “impressions ” of Crusty
and the opinions of Rev. Fidgett, B. A. (late of
Melbourne D.T.), the cockneys must be just now
picking up a queer sort of education in Australian
history, social, political and otherwise.
David Christie Murray once more :
It is unfortunate that Australians sec the worst types
of Englishmen. English parents give their incorriglbles
a “ last chance,” make them a present of £IOO, amf send
them off to Australia. English cockneys travel in the
colonies, offensively attempt to patronise' their hosts, and
gratuitously flaunt the assumption that colonists are
necessarily inferior to home-bred people. “Met a little
girl th’ other day,” says the eye-glassed idiot, beaming
fatuously round the table, “ little colonial girl, don't you
know. She’d read George Eliot. Never-was more sur-
mised in my life.” “ And this to a company of Austr-
ian ladies and gentlemen born and bred,’ remarks the
writer. Wien Mr. Murray went to the Bluff in New
Zealand to touch “ the southernmost gas-lamp in the
world,” he saw a Scot leaning against that lamp-post in a
state of abject drunkenness, and, as Stevenson says of a
similar personage, “ radiating in dirt and humbii*-.”
“Et’s a nice leetle coal’ny,” said the man, “ but”it
wants inergy, and it wants interprise, and it wants(hic)
shobricty.”

Secretary A, R. E. Burton recently pro-
posed to lecture in Melbourne on behalf of the
National Scripture Education League. At the
appointed hour, six ladies, four men, one clergy-
man, and a little girl rolled up to form an
enthusiastic audience. Burton himself made the
baker’s dozen, and 13 being “ the devil’s own
number,” the lecture was postponed.
The priest in charge of the Argenteuil
Holy Coat avers that the opposition garment at
Treves has only one patch of the real article in it
and as that corresponds in colour and texture with
that at Argenteuil, and is not a bit like the rest of
the Treves coat, the presumption is that the latter
is a fraud except as regards that particular
portion. All the young women who have hitherto
been employed in the Treves restaurants and
hotels have been dismissed and during the
exposition of the relic no females wall be allowed
to wait on visitors.
Says the Argonaut ; —Dynasties crumble j
thrones totter; palaces and churches are swept
from existence by the decaying elements of time.
Therefore we can but question that so perishable
a piece of raiment as this garment, now on
exhibition at Treves, may have been worked up
by the priesthood of this most ancient church for
the delectation of the citizens of Treves, and as a
money-making incentive to its seven hundred
public-houses, and as an excuse for the appoint-
ment of a hundred extra policemen.
Placards, says the cable, are posted all
over Nankin accusing the Christian residents of
gross crimes. No doubt there is something in it.
The best of Christians must have a great struggle
to keep good—in Nankin.
It is notable that the pompous Australian
officials ho “never read the newspapers” kee’p
clerks who clip out of the journals all refer-
ences to their lordly masters and paste up the
cuttings in scrap books.
At a meeting of the Great Extended
Hustlers Tribute 00., Bendigo, the manager in
his report regretted that though the shaft had
been sunk to nearly 2000 ft. nothing payable had
been met with. A shareholder, sick of paying
calls, meekly asked how much further they were
going to sink. “We’ll sink till we reach hell,”
was the reply of Dr. Atkinson, the chairman.
Two occasions on which the cunning
Chinaman didn’t “get there” may be told. Once,
when the refrigerating-chamber of an ocean
steamer was opened, in Sydney, a few frozen
Chinkies, who had been there all the voyage, fell
out and were taken away to be thawed. Another
one in another vessel hid himself away in a dark
corner ; but he was suspected. A sailor went
round with a long pointed iron rod, and jabbed
every dark place until at last he found that some
inches of the rod were covered with sanguinary
liquor. Further search was made and the bleed-
ing Chinkie dragged forth. He wanted so badly
to live in George-street, Sydney, that he didn’t
squeal when the iron entered his wide pants and
started to look for his soul.
From Sydney Echo : —
A goat which has two legs and which, in walking,
stands in an upright position like a human being, is
bringing shekels to the pockets of its owner.
Very likely. The goat is forced to write the
“ Bone Idler” columns in the S.M. Hekald, and
the inhuman owner draws upon cashier Newman
for the money..
