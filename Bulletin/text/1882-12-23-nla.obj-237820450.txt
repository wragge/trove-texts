Pompey Parkes’ Fharsalia
When with a stream of stricken fugitives—
consisting of broken legions mingled with
jobbers, camp parasites, cooks, pimps, and all
the tag-rag and bobtail of Imperial Rome —the
routed army of Pompey fled from the Plains of
Phatsalia to the hills, the victorious C/ESAR found
not only the evidences of the luxuries and the
voluptuousness and the patrician splendour of his
enemies in the swiftly abandoned camps—but what
was most precious of all, his secret correspon-
dence ! The two hundred eagles of his broken
legions, the golden couches, the tables spread
with plate and wines—what were these in com-
parison with the letters to the conspirators of
those days —to the men who had been living on
the eorruption of Eome—who had been distract-
ing the people—fattening on dishonest contracts —
contemplating larger and richer and more
dangerous enterprises ? Hero were all the threads
of all the plots in the hands of Cjssae ; while
Pump by was flying to the iEgean islands, to Cilicia,
to Alexandria.
When our Kiama Pompey, whose Pharsalia has
been fought at Illawarra, fled from his defeat—
with precisely such a crowd as that which (b.c.
48) accompanied the other one—did he leave any
papers behind him ? This is the question of over-
whelming interest just now. We shall no doubt
get the gorgeous bed-room furniture, about which
old “Pid.” had such a lively curiosity — the
pictures and objects of art selected by Pompey,
and by those discriminating artists who bought
for Pompey with our money. We shall have the
furniture—(it is massive, and would be incon-
venient to remove)—but what about the precious
papers ? Shall we be privileged to look upon the
playful affectionate letters from the diplomatic
“shixty per cent.” who plays Ambassador
for us at St. James’s, and who arranged the
Imperial progresses of Pompey in Europe P
Shall we know whether Pompey or Saul, or both,
wrote the telegrams which daily informed us at
our breakfast of the king, or prince, or noble who
was the day before favoured by Pompey’s notice P
Shall wo find many plans and specifications on
sheets of note-paper of bridges to be constructed
at a million apiece by amateur engineers and
mythical capitalists ? Shall we find the tender
originals of Mrs. Bakdweu's epistles on higher
education, with Wilkins’s commentaries for the
use of common schools? Shall we be helped tf
an acquaintance with the costliness of Parliamen-
tary distinction, and be enabled to judge whethei
it is more ruinous to contest an election or tc
accept a seat in a chamber of nominees r Shal
we, in fine, be enabled to obtain the materials of &
faithful political history of the last four years ?
• • *
Or, is it that, notwithstanding Labiends Wat-
son, Lentulus Foster, Afkanics Ben
wick, and Metellus Davies have fled away
into the night, and Pompey himself is lying or
the sands, they have all taken care to leave m
no written memorial of their greatness and om
calamities ? Have twenty centuries of Christianity
and observation and expesience taught us to im-
prove upon the negligence of those patriciai
pagans who fought and bled and died, and left
their letters behind them for the perusal of their
victorious enemy; or were these preoicus commu-
nications carted away as they were on a former
occasion before C.esak entered the camp ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Murder of Murderers.
0:n*of the commonest of the many delusions we oheiish
Is the delusion that we are a humane people. We can-
not hear of a horse being ill-treated or one woolly-
beaded ravage in the Solomon Islands beating the
brains out of another with a club without shuddering
This is very nice and creditable and church-bazaary,
bat infernally absurd when compared with our apathy
with regard to ten times more atrocious things that art
occurring in our midst almost every week. Is it gener-
ally known that murderers are murdered in this country i
If not, it is time that it should be. There is seldott
such a thing as an execution here. We not only allow
the barbarity of banging to exist, but allow it to be
Carrie 1 out badly. At Deniliquin, the other day, an
unfortunate wretch was left dangling and kicking in
the air for half an hour before life was extinguished.
We should like to have got bim to dictate this article
during that time, if ha had not been hindered by a
slight impediment of speech. We don’t understand
legislators anyhow we look at them. One would think
that they would, even for selfish reasons, take some
trouble to see that executions were made as painless as
possible. The law is not supposed to revenge itself by
hanging a murderer. It simply takes his life in exchange
for the life he has taken. There is no reason in the
world, therefore, why a poor quivering creature should
be roped and white-capped and knotted under the ear,
and then jerked and swung and pushed about till he is
stiff. Why not pound him to death at once ? If it is
found absolutely necessary to take a life for a life, it is
very strange that while we have machines for doing
everything else with mathematical exactitude, we can’t
invent one to execute criminals cleanly and promptly,
instead of allowing a brutal hangman to toss them
about as though they were dead dogs, and then pull
and haul at them till they die in long-drawn agonies.
Though they are criminals, they have still something
of humanity about them which should save them from
desecration. We don’t object to a man being hilled at
any time, as long as his slaughter pleases somebody,
but we like to see him slaughtered artistically. Wo
are one with De Qttincet in this. But we think the
mngman should be discharged from his position if ho
hang no better than that. It would be a graceful
"thing to offer him a C.M.G.-ship to retire upon.
The Greek Question.
Un li S3 the Homan Catholic members wish to see the
order for another jehad (issued from Kiama by the
Prophet Parkes) faithfully fulfilled, they will quietly
take a back seat in this Parliament. It is creditable to
the native-born R.C. members that they manifest no
disposition whatever to revive the strife of the past,
and that they are quite content to follow a liberal
Protestant leader who will surround himself in the
Cabinet with moderate men, and shun everything con-
ducive to “ holy war." It is generally understood that
one or two imported Greeks mean to try their “ level
best" to get portfolios, but it is altogether unlikely
they will succeed. We hope, for the sake of peace and
order, that Mr. Stuart will call to his side no Roman
Catholic member but Mr. Dallet, the most eloquent,
and not the least liberal, of native-corn Australians.
A Priestly Dives.
The Archbishop of Canterbury died lately. When he
was alive he had £30,000 a year, and Lambeth Palace
to live in. Christ, his Master, was sold for thirty
pieces of silver, and hadn’t a place wherein to lay His
head. Which shows how Christianity has prospered
since the days of its Founder. We wonder what sort
of a figure the ghost of His Grace cut, when, clad in
the ghost of the fine broadcloth coat it used to weir on
earth, it stood before the Throne of Him who was
content to wear a single seamless garment, and could
not make an-wer for the naked and the needy, the p or
and the hungry, who dragged out r, living death in the
dens of London, while my Lord feasted on the fat of
the land! Sinners as we are, O departed prelate, wn
would not change places with you now. If we had a
chance to do so when you were alive, it might have been
another matter.
Review.
“ Aux pieds de Cockerill je viens m’humilier,
Et gouter le plaisir, do me faire oublier.”
Racine (slightly changed).
We have been favoured with the perusal of one of the
veryfsmallest newspapers, we presume, in the who’.*
world. It is printed on two sheets of rather coart e
letter paper, by Ernest Vcnholder and Co, pics U
Prison A Charleroi. It is called “L’Education Popu-
laire," and its Directeur-Bodacteur is M. Clement
Lyon, who signs his leaders with his commercial title
as “Secretaire de la Chambre de Commerce de Charle-
roi." We may remark that this secretariate is ad-
vertised in several places, and, indeed, somewhat-
off ensively paraded, just as if it were a C.M G. Thus
immediately beneath the column under the heading
“Prix de 1’Abonnement," the title and the address
of the Directeur-Eedacteur are given, and the
world is informed that he may be heard of
“ a Charleroi rue de Montigny, No. 9." A
hasty glance at the journal would suggest the idea,
indeed, that it is an enlarged visiting card *f M. Lyon
or a standing advertisement of that commercial man of
letters. But this would be an error. The little paper
has a leader, as we have said, and, of all subjects in the
world, on Sir Henry Parkes and ourselves. It is
headed: “Apropos de la visile eu Belgique de Sir
Henry Parkes, Ministre President de la Nouvelle-
Galles du Sud (Australic).” Sir Henry is described
in this little paper, (which, by the way, is intellectually
about the size of—say—Dr. Renwick) as "ce vieillurd
respectable et instniit," and is represented as ‘ voyageanlen
simple particulier and as having been very kindly
received, among other places, at Charleroi—in all prola-
bility at No. 9 rue de Montigny. And here, strangely
enough, is where we come in; we, who have the honour
of being described as The Bulletin of Sidney. It wifi
be remembe.ed that, in accounting for the royal w 1.
come to Belgium ef Sir Henry Parkes, we presumed l»
suggest that His Majesty of Belgium was a princi a
shareholder ia the stael-rail factories of Cockerill a d
Co., a firm which has a strong interest iu Australia j
contracts, and to infer than the crowned host appeared
rather in his commercial than ia his royal char-aster—
that he laid aside his crown and took up his Cockerill—
that it was in his Stock Exchange rather than in his
monarchical function that he met the vieillard respectable
who also has a taste for manufactures and engineering
and who possibly at the very moment that he bowed
before King Cockerill had i a his trousers pocket Mr.
Garbett’s design of a million-pound North Shore
bridge sketched iu pencil on a visiting card. However
this may be, all that we did was to point out that
Cockerill was a royal house—a crowned and anointed
factory, the very wheels of which were oiled, not with
your vulgar grease, but with the chrism of a cons.-,
crated king; and that Sir Henry Parkes would d .
wall to be careful in the midst of such grandeur
and mystery. Now, this is the way the little
journal treats ns for our warning. We ex-
tract the final paragraph of M. Clement Lyon .- —
“ Nous U9 sommes pas ii mome d’ 1’autorite.
ni la consideration qui peuvent ou non s’attacher, eu
Australia, an journal anglais Ike Bulletin of Sidney
mais nous tenons a dire que, quelque soit la p. sitiou
que ce journal occupe dans la presse australienue, il so
deconsidere totalemeut dans 1’esprit des hounctcs gens
et de tens les amis du peuple beige en agissaat commo
il vient de le faire; ce n'est pas a uu Roi aussi haute,
ment respscW, pour ses et humaui-
taires, a un Roi paciflque qui deper.se son temps et sc.
fortune, avoc un desinWressement admirable aim
de poxsscr la civilisation au cmur meina do
1‘Afrique, oil rogue encore le honteux tr.ific des
esclaves ; ce n’est pas ii uu peuple qui vit en paix avee
la monde entier, a ii travaille et qui Intte sans rulache
pour la Zc scs industries et de con commerce,
qui, sans craindro la concurrence, arbore franchement
st vaillamu-eat sur lent le maicles, ie drapeau do la
liberty commerciale, qu’on pent adresser d'aussi vils
reproches ; aussi, nous avona l intime conviction que la
population australienne, qui, grace a uu sol excessive-
ment riche, et'au caractere industrieux de ses habi-
tants, a tout intdret a developper aussi ses relations
commerciales avec nous, saura blamer, comme il la
1’acte raalhonnete et jrossier qu’r posd, en sou
nom, The Bulletin of Sidney, alors que la Belgique
hospitaliere vient de faire un accueil si roellement princier
au premier ministre de la Nouvelle-Gailes du Sud."
It will be seen that not one word of contradiction of
our statement, that His Gracious Majesty makes and
sells railway material to the world, is ventured upon.
But we are told that he is a highly respected monarch
—has generous and humanitarian ideas —pushes civili-
zation into the heart of Africa, and so on. No doubt
of it —a most estimable Sovereign—but still a regal
Cockerill. “Prisoner,” said the solemn judge to the
accused, who had received the most flattering testi-
monials to his philanthropy, “you appear to have been
a, man of the purest and holiest life—capable of the
noblest sacrifice—and elevating and blessing society l y
the beauty of your example; but it is equally clear
that you have stolen two pairs of ducks !" We shall
forward several copies of this number to the Roi puci-
fique—and to the Directeur-Eedacteur de L’Educatiou
Popnlaire a Charleroi rue de Montigny No. 9.

“Well-Connected.”
Walter M'Ci.intock, the Post-office clerk who was
caught by the departmental detective stealing money
from letters, got the extraordinary and unaccountably
light sentence of two years’ imprisonment. Mr.
M’Clintock has the good fortune to be “ well-
connected.” Anybody could see, or could imagine,
from the style in which certain witnesses gave their
evidence, that Waltbb was ‘‘well-connected’’ Per-
haps, had he not belonged to n high-toned set, he’d be
now in Berrima doing hia “solitary” like an ordinary
mortal. It’s a grand thing, in this country where we
are all so blue-blooded, to be “ well-counocted ’’ The
thief, even, can get a Government billet, if ho be
a “well-connected" thief. The Post-office, (just now,
would appear to be a den of thieves. The efforts of the
honest men in it are nullified by the doings of “ well-
counocted” scoundrels. Objection has been taken, by
“well-connected" people, to the employment of a
detective in the Post-office. There is no place on this
earth where the services of a detective are more
urgently needed. Everyone in the community has had
a letter stolen. The honest official has nothing to fear
from the detectives, who appear to be dreaded by the
thieves —even by the “ well-connected " thieves. On
behalf of the community we thank Detective Abbott
for catching M’Clintock. We hope he’ll catchall the
rest of the Post-office prigs. We xotice that there are
some law-points reserved in M'Clintock’s case. Should
M'Clistock get off some one will have to be kicked out
of the Crown Law Department. We hope Detective
Abbott won’t be disrated. We trust he is well-con-
nected. We also trust that G. H. Sbid’s tirade against
detectives in the Post-office was a result of the intel-
lectual prostitution to which everv banister has
occasionally to submit. If it wasn’t, then Mr. George
Eeid evidently wants to be “ well-connected.”
The Song of the Shirt.
Mr. David Death, 'of Death, Schiess, and Co., is prasi-
dent of the Melbourne Association ot Ker-ristian
young men, and in his clothing factory David employs
a lot of young women, who are evidently heathens.
They must be heathens. They’ve struck. They’ve
absolutely declined to continue any longer in the
service of this holy man and sew his beatified breeches,
virtuous vests, and pious pagets. There are nearly 300
of these girls, and they’re all “out,” except twenty,
who can’t help themselves, and are forced by sheer
necessity to keep their noses to the grindstone of the
boss of the Young Men’s Christian Association. Hers
is a clipping from the Aoe, Melbourne : — “ A man who
buys a ready-made sac suit of clorhes, and pays £2 10s.
for it, will be surprised to learn that the girl who made
his coat received, before the present reductions
were made, only 2s. 81. for her work j that the maker
of his vest received only lid., and that the trousers
hands received a correspondingly lew price. We are
informed that some twelve months ago the vest hands
were paid lid for men’s vests. This amount was sub-
sequently reduced to lOd , then to 9d., then to 81., and
the employes bore these reductions patiently; bat when
they heard that there was to be a further reduction to
7d., they resisted. Three months ago, it is stated that
coat hands were paid 2s. 8d per coat; this amount was
reduced to 2s. 51, and, last Tuesday, it was intimated
that there would be a further reduction to 2s., which
they also opposed. The trouser hands also struck
against the lowering of their small earnings, and, as
stated before, none but a few coat hands have resumed
work. Most of these have been compelled to do se
from family circumstances. Besides the reductions we
have mentioned, the price paid to what are known as
“ buttonhole hands ” in coats has been reduced to the
extent of Is. in paget coats, and to 8d. in sae coats. We
are informed tint under the reductions two of the
smartest girls in the factory were unable, last week, to
earn more than 15s., though they worked hard for
fourteen hours a day. Girls who used to get 10d. for
children’s holland coats are now expected to make them
for Gd , and it is claimed, as a whole, that girls cannot
honestly make a living at the prices proposed by
Messrs. Death, Schiess, and Co.” We read that two
other big Melbourne firm* are awaiting the result of
this strike with a view of “ regulating ” the wages paid
to their girls. The fact s as stated by the Age have not
heeu controverted. If the Age’s statement is correct,
we say God help the sewing girls of Melbourne, for the
pious president of the Y.M.C.A. doesn’t seem inclined
to help them. We notice that Mr Neville Griffiths,
M.L A., has set a good example by subscribing £5
towards the fund to enable the girls to fight their holy
employer. Now, Mr. Griffiths has never posed as a
democrat, and we want to see our so-ealled working-
men’s members look into this matter. We hope to
see a subscription raised for the girls in every factory
and workshop in the country.
The self-dubbed “Professor” Gilbert, who had the
impudence to bring a speculative libel action against
the Maryborough Chronicle, appears to be a fool who
makes his living because Providence is good and
makes great fools for lesser ones to live upon. He was,
by Lis own admissions, a slab of solid ignorance. When
cross-examined, it was found that he hadn’t the most
distant acquaintance with Latin, and “didn’t know no
Greek.” He gave himself out as a professor of physi-
ognomy. And the next moment he said he “ believed ”
he " had heard of Lavater." The whole of his answers
under cross-examination indicated that he was an
uncultured man who had managed to get at the end of
his tongue a few catch phrases of anatomy and a few
half-understood scientific terms. Bat we don’t
wonder at the fact that Gilbert makes money
by his discourses on “ Amativenoss.” A large
section of the public trusts and supports far
more ignorant men in a much larger and more
momentous sphere. For example, there is, in this
city, the advertising “medical practitionera crea-
ture with huge grisly ears like bats’ wings, and eyes
the dead dull light of which looks like phosphorescent
putrefaction. He is the creature who battens and
fattens on ignorant credulity, who knows no grammar,
no medicine—no anything—who has never been to
college or to school, who shoves men into their graves
as a wharf-lumper sboves a bag of grain down a shoot.
And he is paid by his victims to destroy them. He is
allowed to do these things here. He piles up money,
and soon makes a fortune in New South Wales, where
we have a law which, allowing any unlettered scoundrel
to dub himself “Doctor," provides carcase* for the
vultures.
N.S.W. Friendly Societies’ Commission Re-
port reveals a deficiency to the extent of ill82,588-
defioieucy so large “that any hope on the part ot the
societies of fulfilling- their obligations under the exist-
ing scale of ooutrioutiona and benefits cannot be re-
garded as other than chimerical."

Dead in the Shoot.

It was daylight at the mines, yet all was still as
stone above,
And the eunrays to the children brought God’s
morning-kiss of love;
Whan a fearful cry rang through the town and
all the sleepers there
Woke up wildly with a sudden sense that Death
was in the air.
Then, half-naked from their houses, the men
rushed into the street,
Swearing they would wring its meaning from the
first man they shonld meet.
When they met him, for the women’s sake, their
cry was stifled low —
“ God of Heav’n, the mine is flooded, and our
mates are down below !”
But the women heard the cry, and flew with feet
and bosoms bare,
To the shaft-mouth, where they huddled close and
shuddered with despair,
And a wail broke forth from ev'ry lip as flame
breaks from a spark,
For the husbands and the fathers who were dying
in the dark.
Dawn again. To those whose hearts were not by
sorrow stricken cold
The bright sun shone like a glory from the open
Gates of Gold,
But to these his light was lurid, for it brought
forebodings fell,
And it seemed to burn the skies like fire flashed
from the mouth of hell.
But the miners moved not till the flood went
down, and then a band
Of the strongest dashed into the drive, a pick in
each right hand;
And they worked in testh-sat silence, every man
like twenty men,
Till they brought the buried from the grave —the
dead to life again.
Then a cheer rose up to Heaven, from the crowd
around the shaft,
Women wept for very gladness and the little
children laughed,
Bearded men did kiss each other —each man
bounding like a boy,
And the flags flew from the house-tops, and the
town went mad with joy.
“ Only five of twenty-seven saved as yet, but
what of that ?
Even now, perhaps, the others have been carried
to the plat.”
So some said, then tried as children do to drown
their fears with noise—
“ Let the bells in ev’ry steeple ring a welcome to
the boys.”
Then a man came slowly up the shaft, with pale
face held askance,
But a flash from fifty searching eyes pierced
through him like a lance ;
And a dreadful hush was in the air, till lifting up
his head
With a husky voice, he told the tale, “ Boys, all
the rest are dead.”
#
Shriek on shriek from frenzied woman—tears as
yet they could not shed —
Mother, sister, wife and sweetheart, each one
wailing for her dead—
Tragic-featured, hair-dishevelled, playing out their
doleful parts,
While the men stood like men frozen, with a
horror at their hearts.
“ You, Maloney, you can tell us, you, the strongest
of the five,
Who were brought back from the darkness to the
light of day alive —
You can go right through the story, how our poor
mates met their death,”
Cried the miners crowding round him, fifty speak-
ing at a breath.
Said he slowly—“ Boys, the story’s very short:
the flood came in,
And it caught us, and It orept from knee to waist,
from waist to ohinu—
Though at first we thought we'd bluffed it, making
by the backward route
Till we reached the higher level and sprang up
into the shoot.
Near and nearer, like the trampling of wild horses,
we could hear
The black waters rushing up the rise—our hearts
stood still with fear
For a moment; than a dreadful sound broke on
the stagnant air,
And the waters were upon us, and we cried in our
despair
To the God we scorned when full of strength, and
free from all heart-aches,
And wo prayed to Him to save us for our wives’
and children’s sakes;
Sharp and short but strong our prayers were—yon
don’t patter them by rote
When the eyes of Death glare* at you, and his
hand is at your throat.
Still no rescue came, and still, with sound that was
the ghost of sound,
Writhed the dank and deadly water like a snake
our bodies round;
Then said Ben and Jabez Bellingham, ‘ We’ve
lived together—we
kneeto'knee 8 ° there * t - ed together
Minahan, my mate, stood by me; ‘ Take my place—
it’s highest here—
You have children —live for their aakos,’ so I
whispered in his ear.
Then I went to sleep, and woke to grasp a hand as
cold as lead,
And once more I prayed to God, because I knew
my mate was dead.
So long days and endless nights went by, where
night and day are one,
Until some of them cried out at last that they
could see the sun—
’Twas your candle, you’ll remember, they were
weak and crazy then ;
Ah ! poor fellows, they will never look upon the
sun again.”
Here he ceased. That day the searchers groping
in the dismal dark
Found them lying in the shoot there —twenty
strong men stiff and stark —
Men, whose glazed eyes would no more on earth
wife, child, or sweetheart see—
And apart from these, two bodies tied together
knee to knee.
All this woe will be forgotten, and the eyes that
now are wet
Time will dry, but there are two things that men
will not soon forget—
How these brethren stood up side by side to meet
their tearful fate,
And how gallant Pete Maloney risked his life to
save his mate.

THEGREAT
ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
TN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journal* of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickott, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as hia opinion.
•* I have found St. JACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
oore, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on hy over-ex.
ertdos in rowing. It ia a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble."
The writer listened attentively to the above. It wa#
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he iya
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

everybody, not only in Furniture, but in PANG?
GOODS of every description. One would wonder how
such a vast collection of PRETTY THINGS could bo
got together. There is no sameness about the display ;
everv step you take brings you to something fresh that
yon have not seen before.
PRESENTS POE OLD
Presents for Young
Presents for Ladies
Presents for Gentlemen
Presents for Boys
Presents for Girls
Thousands of articles, choice and beautiful, of tf
variety far too numerous to particularise, have been
brought together and arranged in such a manner that
intending buyers have greater facilities for selecting
what they really require. Nearly every one likes to
make a present of some kind at Christmas, but the
difficulty lies in selecting. What shall I buy ? or what
shall I give ? are words which go the rounds of the
family circle as the festive season approaches. Now all
difficulty of this kind is removed. Those intending to
make presents need not trouble what the articles shall
be; they have only to walk through our show-rooms and
find the articles self-suggesting.
THE BAZAAR
which has excited so much attention, and been so
liberally patronised for the last two weeks, has now
reached the state of completion. In magnitude and
beauty it eclipses anything of tho kind before attempted,
and is consequently reckoned amongst the foremost of
our city attractions.
READER 1 —If you contemplate furnishing through-
out ; if you are desirous of adding to an already fur-
nished and comfortable home, or if it is your wish at
this happy season to make a present to some relation
or friend, purchase at THE GREAT CHRISTMAS
BAZAAR, at the ROYAL FURNISHING ARCADE.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Mr. Bardwell, who was the husband of Mrs.
Bardwell, and used to write long letters on her behalf
to the papers, is dead.
It is currently reported that Henri Ketten has at
last reached the first movement (adagio funebre) of life’s
grand finale. In other words, he is dying.
According to the extreme opinion of his innocence,
&c., entertained in some quarters, Arabi should have a
peerage and Sir Garnet ongbt to be hanged.
Mr. John Duff, late of the Botanio Gardens,
has been appointed Inspector of Forests. Duff's wood-
craft is well known; moreover, he is a buahman, and
the prince of good fellows. If not a poet, he is a good
hand at a yarn—none better.
The fact that Sir Garnet Wolseley and Sir
Beauchamp Seymour have just got £50,000 each and a
peerage for their services in Egypt, reminds us that
after Waterloo the grants to Wellington amounted to
£700,000; to Nelson, nearly £200,000.
Charles Stuart Parnell, the leader of the Irish
National party, is, as is well known, a Protestant. By
the way, the first man who used the name of ” Catholic
Emancipation,” and got up a petition to Parliament
on its behalf, was a Presbyterian minister of Connty
Down.
His Honor the Chief Justice is very seriously
ill, and as he is suffering from more than one form of
organic disease, his medical advisers entertain but little
hope of his thorough recovery. We understand that
Archbishop Vaughan visited Sir James on Thursday
night last.
A son has been bom to Sir Charles Gavan
Duffy, who ia verging on 70, and some time ago married
a very young wife. This confirms the rumour that Sir
Charles has, for a long time, been engaged in the pre-
paration of another number of “ Young Ireland.” This
is Sir Charles’ third marriage.
As Sir W. J. Clarke is the richest Australian,
so Vanderbilt is the wealthiest American. He “holds
it" to the extent of £60,000,000 sterling. Jay Gould ia
worth £5,000,000. Maekay. the silver king, two; Eooke-
fellow, “ the Kerosene Prince,” two ; Stanford, do;
while Cyras Field, D, C. Mills, Fair, J. A. Keene, and
Sloane, though not fo wealthy, have never yet been
obliged to be “out” when their laundresses called.
Nearly all of them, though, chew tobacoo and—what is
worse —say “ Why, cert’nly.”
Mr. Julian Salomons, Q.C., the Australian
Judah Benjamin, has again been compelled by ill-health
to leave for England. The departure of Mr. Salomons,
whose practice at the bar yielded him about £6000 a
year, gives a splendid chance to the juniors. It ia true
that Mr. Barley, Q.C., and Mr. Simpson will soon be
back ; but, then, Mr. John Want will probably be absent
for a long while, and Mr. Pilcher, it is generally under-
stood, will leave for England in the middle of next
year, should politics not interfere with his much-
needed and well-earned holiday.
From Vanity Fair: —“Scone at Balmoral.—
Mr. John Brown, having been sent by Her Majesty in
queatof the Lady-in-Waiting, who happened to be the
Dueheas of M , suddenly stumbled against her. J.
B., loquitur, “ Hoot, mam, yer just the woman I was
looking for." Enraged Duchess dashes incontinently
into the Royal preienao and expostnlatingly exclaims
to Her Majesty, “ Madam, J.B. has insulted me: he
has had the impertinence to call me a woman ? " To
which the Queen replies, with cutting serenity, " And
pray what are you ?” Exit Duchess.
The feeling of the British public towarde Arabi
has completely altered. The change is due to the
simple fact that the public are beginning to know more
about Arabi and his doings than Ministerial speakers
and Ministerial writers bad thought proper to make
known. To no one is Arabi more* deeply indebted for
this change than to the able and impartial correspon-
dent of the Standard. But for that gentleman, says
Vanity Fair, it is not too much to say that he would
have been hanged, drawn, and quartered long ago, to
the great relief of our Government.
Here is what Oscar Wilde says of the “Eose
Leaf and Apple Leaf ” velume of the new poet, Eennell
Eodd“ Some of these poems are as iridescent and as
exquisite as a lovely fragment of Venetian glass;
others, as delicate in perfect workmanship and as
simple in natural motive as an etching by Whistler is,
or one of those beautiful little Greek figures which, in
the olive woods around Tanagra, men can still find,
with the faint gilding and the fading crimson not yet
fled from hair and lips and raiment; and many of them
seem like one of Corot’s twilights, just passing into
music ; for not merely in visible colour, but in senti-
ment also—whieh is the colour of poetry—may there
be a kind of tone."
Even Paris professes to be scandalised by the
last public act of M. Elisha the Communist geo-
grapher, who has just married two of his daughters
according to a form of his own, which, at least, claims
to be simple in its inception and details The lovers of
the two girls, having duly informed the father that they
wished to wed his daughters, he at once gave his con-
sent and a dinner, at which, the choice of the young
couples having beaa semi-publicly announced, M.
■proceeded to give them a secular paternal blessing.
Viola tout I His daughters are now married, he an-
nounoes. If M. makes it known that he is
ready to marry other people’s daughters in a similar
way, no doubt he will have numerous couples anxious to
be tied up, at all events temporarily, in so delightfully
arcadian and illegal a fashion.
During the ordeal of a rush of American re-
porters on the steamer, each eager to interview her
first, Mrs. Langtry scored points all the time Though
it was just after daylight in the mornning, and just off
a sea-voyage, she never looked prettier, and was never
for a moment discomposed. To all questions about her-
self, she replied without embarrassment, and with un-
affected directness. It was suggested she would make
a fortune, and then what would she do with it ? “ Oh I
I don’t know,” she replied, artlessly; •* I don’t think
much of money, although it is very pleasant to have
plenty of it, especially after you have been poor. But
if you have a great deal you won’t have time to spend it
all, and people who make one fortune get stingy—don’t
they ?—and go ahead making more. I think I might
do something for the profession if I should make a
fortune—establish a theatre, for instance.” When a
reporter asked if she was not now judged in England
not as a member of society, but as a member of the
profession, sho replied: “ Yes, that is so, I had a
groat many friends, and they were very kind to me;
but now the people judge me on my merits, and I
haven’t any." Just fancy looking up into those inde-
scribable eyes, and listening to pretty things like
thatl
Mr. J. flenniker Heaton, who, by the way, ia
looking fresh and gay after his semi-regal tour
in the Old World, has received from Lord
Sydney the correspondence (comprising over 200 letters)
between Governor Phillip and his Lordship’s grand-
father, the first Secretary of State for the Colonies.
They give a complete history of the early struggles of
those who formed this delightful settlement. Some of
the letters arc exceedingly interesting—from various
points of view. One of them, which will perfectly
entrall the missionaries, instructs Governor Phillip, on
behalf of His Britannic Majesty’s Government (old
George was Defender of the Faith, you know), as soon
after his arrival in N.S W. as possible to obtain from
the Friendly Islands two hundred women as “ wives ”
for the founders of our aristocracy. Some of these
gentry aren’t very “ white men ” now; but had old
Lord Sydney’s instructions been strictly attended to,
it’s very hard to tell what 'colour some of us might be.
It will be observed that we include our noble selves—in
order to give as little offence as possible. Then there’s
a letter iu which somebody is requested to send out,
also as wives for the colonists, a oouple of hundred
ladies from the London trottair. All this is perfectly
dreadful.
When Mr. W. B. Dailey, the other night, at the
Lecture on Dante, by Dr. Badham, said that the
learned and brilliant Professor had been authoritatively
declared to be one of the very greatest of living scholars,
the speaker had no doubt in his mind the testimony of
Professor Cobet, of the University of Leiden. Gobet
has been pronounced to be the worthy of
Hemsterhuis, Eulmken, and Valcknaer; and in wide
range of knowledge, covering the entire field of Greek
literature, in critical comprehension of the spirit of an
author, and in sagacious emendations of doubtful pas-
sages, to be like Bentley, though with a safer judgment.
He lectures in Latin, and has such a conversational
mastery of the tongue that at the ter-oentenary of his
famous University, his colleague Dozy, the renowned
Arabia scholar, wittily said of him. " II ne reste qne
deux homines in Europe, qui parlent le Latin; ce aonl le
Pape et M. Cobet.” He regards Dr. Badham as the
first of the classical scholars of the age, and has
publicly given his testimony to this effect in these
words, which we publish in answer to an enquiry as to
the European evidences of Dr. Badham’s unrivalled
scholarship: “ Multi anni sunt, ex quo Carolum Bad-
hamum bibliothecas Italioas meoutn explorantem
oognovi, eognitumque ita probavl et admiratus sum, nt
ei omnium qui nostra state literas antiqnas oolnnt
anteponam ne ninam, non tantnm propter aoonratam et
sanam dootrinam, sed prsesertim propter judioli
acumen et sagax ingeninm quo tantnm valet nt Bri-
tannia Porsonum snum et Elmsleiam reddere vide-
atum,"
Sixty-one votes afainst thirty-eight; soK.C.M.G.
and cash go into the Senate, and LL.B. and pre-eminent
culture stay outside. It's all very fine to say that the
Catholics should be more adequately represented in the
University Senate; but, if they want Senators elected,
let them pnt forward University men. We don’t know
whether or not Mr. Jefferis’ nomination was the result
of the desire of a few bigots to run a Protestant against
a Catholic, If it was, then we’re glad Mr. Jefferis is
not " in it ” this time. He is a liberal and gifted man,
and we hope yet to see him in the councils of Alma
Mater. After all, there is no possible objection what-
ever, except on the ground above stated, to the election
of Sir Patrick Jennings, who has been very generous to
our University.
All the facts of the Due de Morny’s connection
with the beautiful young Eussian actress are pretty well
known new, and they all show how unspeakably despic-
able he is. Directly he had rung up his servants to the
wounded girl, he left the house, saying to a valet, “ I
must not let myself be worried any more.” During 30
hours that har strong vitality fought with death, she
intensely desired to see him, bnt her messages were
unnoticed. Directly she expired, she was taken to her
own villa. Her body was laid out on a bed painted blue
and white, and tapestried with ohintz. The hair, which
was blonde and curly, was unfastened by the Sisters of
Charity who came in to lay out the body and watoh by
it. They placed the head on a lace-edged pillow and
garlanded the coverlet with tea-roses. No trace of
beauty remained. The eyes were encircled with dark
bistrous rings. Actresses sent crowns, crosses, and
flowers, but the Duo did no more than order the funeral
coaches, and stipulate that they should be cheap. He
walked, more from bravado than feeling, bshind the
hearse with two of his gilded set, and made a joke
abont “ we three widowers.” The pope o( the Greek
Church, to which the beautiful young wildflower of the
Eussian Steppes belonged, stated that he was distinctly
requested to celebrate the obsequies as cheaply as
possible. And he added “ Mademoiselle Feyghlne
must have been insane indeed to have killed herself for
a Da Moray. Sho should have been contented with
spitting in his face.”
We see that amongst those present at the
Lyceum, on the first night of ” Much Ado,” was Mr.
Charles Dickens. Very little is known abont the suc-
cessor to an immortal name out here, where he is
credited with merely being the author of a guide-book,
and other brochure 3 of a similar kind ; but as a matter
of fact, be is a man of, if not great, at least very varied
attainments As a proof of bis literary aoumen, we
may state that the judgment he displays in editing
“ All the Year Bound ’’ still makes that periodical
the bast thing of its kind published in the language.
It may, indeed, he said to be, if anything, better edited
than in Dickens’s time, since the great novelist wrote
so little in it himself, and insisted always upon employ-
ing the same staff of writers (his personal friends) some
of them—notably Mortimer Collins, Frances Trollope,
and Speight—being totally nnadapted for that kind of
writing. In person Charles Dickens is the very anti-
thesis of hie late father, being short and rotnnd—built
something, indeed, on the principle of the henpecked
Captain in Gilbert’s Bab Ballad. He and his father
didn’t “ hit it ’’ after Dickens separated from his wife,
as the son tided with his mother. At that time C.D.,
junior, was a wine-merchant —and sold very bad wine,
too, so his friends tearfully said; but he dabbled in
literature to the extent of being dramatie critic to The
Queen, and acted in a secretarial capacity to Mr. John
Hollingshead, lessee of the London Gaiety. His bon-
homie made him a great favourite, and he was to be
found at every place worth going to, and at every dinner
where the wine was not of his providing. He was a regular
habitat of Evans’s, and numberless are the bons-mots he
continually let off there, holding his own with such men
as Burnand, Toole, Terry, Thorne, and other aoknow-
lodged wits and farqeurs, Ho never seemed to be able to
commit them to paper, though. As a dramatist—he
adapted his father’s "Battle of Life"—he was a
failure, and has not persevered further in that line, but
on the other hand, he is a capital practical printer, and
is now in a very large way of business, trading as
"Charles Dickens and Evans, of the Crystal Palace
Press.” We should say, altogether, that when this
Charles Dickens dies, his memory will remain green
with a certain section of the London public for several
weeks.
America is ablaze with Lily Langtry. And
New York has rushed to see " the most portrait-taken
woman ” as it has never rushed to gaze on any feminity
since the days of Jenny Lind. Tickets for her first
night’s performance fetched nearly £2000. Exporters
(we’re afraid to say how many) crowded the Arizona as
it came up the bay to New York, and at five o’clock in
the morning (how many beauties could stand that
hour?) they interviewed her. “Flaneur,” correspon-
dent of the ’Frisco Argonaut, was the first man intro-
ducod; and the Tribune, Herald, World, Sun,
Times, and Lord knows who, followed. And then —she
only smiled on them a few minutes, and spoke some
pleasant words —then, they all went onshore again, and
nearly wrote their heads off. It’s worth reading what
they say, tso; for some of it is well written. Here’s a
picture : " Mrs, Langtry had come up the companion-
way, and she stood on the promenade, gracefully poised
upon shapely and dainty feet, that peeped out from
under a short knitted skirt of blue serge. Her hands
were employed with her gloves, her eyes and features
with welcoming smiles from her friends; and her
appearance and bearing presented a realization of their
ideal to the admirers of classic Greek beauty—in all
things harmony; everywhere gracefulness; in outline,
speech, and action, repose. From under a simple little
hat, which did not hide the delicate moulding of her
temples, hung a heavy coil of lustrous, dark
brown hair. Her photographs have made known
the lines of her all bnt perfect profile, but they
have not hinted at the loveliness of her great
violet eyes, nor suggested the marvellous mobility
of her features. In them, and in the perfect purity
of her complexion, lies the charm of her wondrous
beauty.” That’s the Tribune. The Sun says:
“She stood erect, with her shoulders back, the full
lines, of har figure perfectly revealed by a dress that
fitted without a wrinkle. The dark blue bodice was un-
relieved except by a brilliant mass of gold braid down
the front and around the collar, and the plaited skirt
fell ia straight lines within a few inches of the deck.
Beneath were two remarkably small English walking,
shoes, and on her head a small hat named after her.
Her hair was in loose and graceful ringlets over her
forehead and drawn in a simple knot behind. Her
waist was very small, and her whole costume was
characterised by elegant simplicity. Her hair is brown,
with a tinge of rich anbnm that looks like geld. Mrs.
Langtry is unquestionably a very beautiful woman.
Her beauty is of the kind that baffles photography,
and'those who have seen her pictures only have no con-
ception of the charm of her face. Her complexion ia
pure white, and almost transparent. The month in
repose has a pathetic or serious expression, and the lips
are as clearly eut as a statue’s. The eyes, however,
are the most winning feature of all.” But the Sun
man seems to have seen different eyes; he asserts
“they are grey, with little jet black pnpils, and are
shaded by long dark lashes. They are wonderfully
expressive, and certainly very effective, for they did
remarkable work yesterday. Mrs Langtry raised them
slowly, and”—but wa don’t think the Sun man is reli-
able beyond this; he seems to wander. No one
appeared able to decide the eye question. They either
couldn’t get a chance to look at them; or else, when
they did look, they couldn't see anything. The Times
1 judiciously refrained from touching the subject; when
the Argonaut was asked what colour Lily’s eyes were,
he at once observed that " he was particularly struck
with her complexion;” and the World, hesitating
between two colours, takes refuge in poetical quota-
tions, and says "they are eyes full of light, whieh
kindle when she smiles.” Altogether, we opine that it
the golden apple of Monnt Ida had to be again given
away, Juno, Minerva, and Venus would have a poor
chance against the Jersey Belle—if New York reporters
did the judging.

sition at Scotland Yard, bnt in the end his ability,

courtesy he displayed, carried the day. He works from
10 to 14 hours a day, and has introduced great improve-
ments in criminal investigation. Ha strongly advocates

tions, which his earlier career shonld have entirely
unfitted him for. He was a gentleman, bat succumbed
to bad influences, and died as above " Mr. Matthew
Arnold,” says Figaro, " has, on further consideration,
abandoned the idea of going to America. Mr. Arnold
never had any intention of visiting Australia 4 for the
sake of studying colonial literature.’ ” Figaro might
have spared us the sneer—Matthew ought to oome out,
if only to read the Holy Howl and the Morning Bum.

says Mrs. Langtry is not equal to a wonderful girl they
have in America, Miss Detohou. Bead I “ There can
be but one opinion as to her marvellous beauty. She is
without question the fairest woman on the American
stage, and, added to the regal possession of a faultless
face, an exquisite figure, and a voice of unmeasured
sweetness and flexibility, over which she has perfect
mastery, there is an indescribable grace of movement

conquests are not confined to the stage alone. Sweet,
charming, cultured, womanly, and pure, she finds a
social recognition not less flattering than that extended
to her gifts as an artist." Mies Chamberlaine, an
American belle, is another coming beauty—the Prince

SUNDRY SHOWS.

The dramatic critic of the Hekker is all right
as long as he sticks to the language of Dubbo, but gets
a bit mixed when to point his satire he borrows from
the Gaul. He aiys: “ ‘ La Perichole ’ was produced in
one of La (sic) Petit Maitre’s happy times.” Oh, was
it P And who was “ La Petit Maitre," who had these
“ happy times ? ” Variety is as pleasing in literature
as in anything else; but what we don’t much care
about is mystery. Life’s too short to be always un-
ravelling these things. When the Echo people write
again of the “ Perichole,” we trust rather to see their
French seldom there than Offenbach.
We have written the following little lyric to the
order (cash down) of Mr. J. C, Williamson :
If Henry W. Chapman goes on like this, he will
end by eloouting professionally, and thus the Sartorial
art will lose a valued votary, Henry gave an entertain,
tnent on Wednesday last at the Protestant Hall, aad in
the intervals in which he treated hioise’f and his
authors to a rest, a very nice young lady—Miss Annie
Kobertf—did some pleasant things with the piano,
Mr. Chapman only recited nineteen pieces on this
occasion, and succeeded in getting his tongue round
the “ Bells " with commendable ea?o, and we are also
delighted to par-raise his “ Parrhasius.” There wts a
great crowd present, and the Mayor completely filled
the chair. It is rumoured that Mr. Chapman contem-
plates giving another recital in a week or two, im which
is to be embodied all Churchill’s “Duel." “ Para-
dise Regained,” Wordsworth’s “Excursion,” “Childe
HaroJd,” “ Hamlet." the 9th Chap, of Isaiah (with
pianoforte accompaniment), Southey’s “Thalaba" (in
costume), Burns’ “ address to the Deil ” (with pyrotech-
nic and sulphurous Pope’s “Essay on Man,”
Gray’s “Eleg;," “Martin Chuzzlewit,” and Q men
Anne’s “ Kecipe for Coin Cure.” We do not btlieve
now that the interesting entertainments will come off.
Henry, peeple say. has been heavily bribed by the life
assurance people not to give it.

In Melbourne, the Turncis have been giving
Maritana” for a change, but Gordon was indisposed,
and the other night Templeton took his place. Biz. is
bad at the Opera House with the new opera, and the
Polks at the Princess’s are only doing so-so with—
Ociel!— “The Banker’s Daughter." “Jack in the Bean-
stalk " is the name of the Melbourne pantomime, and
the locals have been done by a literary party by the
name of Brown.
* * * *
Harwood had a bumpor of a ben. on Monday,
and on Wednesday (too late for notice), a series of con-
certs were begun at the Royal. The following are the
artistsSignora Marietta Bull! Paoli. Signora Matilde
Boy Gilbert, fignor Angusto Casts!li, Signor Enrico
Shrisoia, Signor Ignazio Viganotti, Signor Davido
Benfereri, Signor Fanstino Ziliani and Giorza. Report
speaks well of the company, so it i« thought pretty
certain that Signora Bulli won’t get the coal shoulder.
Signora Matilda is also s' nted to be a very good Boy
Gilbert, but about Signor Enrico Sbrisoia. we cannot at
this stage Sbriscia-n opinion. Oh, and M Kate Tbayor
(W. E. Chapman) who. was manager for Wilhelm], has
in ken the Masonic Hall for four nights d partir de
Kcrrissemasse day, and announces that a number of people,
including Sheridan, who have “ volunteered.” Amongst
these volunteers are the names of Harry Woods and
Mrs. Hanie. 0. O. Michel and our Sarophonie friend.
Wo hope the affair will be a Hodge success. We
wondtr, by-the-way, what C. O. Michel will do. Inter,
prot probably ; or give imitations of Mr. Marsh and
Judge Dowling “No scandal about Queen Elizabeth,
we hope ” Will Chapman is going to recite, which will
he very nice; and Percy Joses, “the Captain of the
Pinafore” will either sing or dance. We hop® the
latter. Our best wishes go with the show, and wo shall
go into it. We always had a hankering after Volun-
teers.
* * * *
Legitimate drama has been made to pay at last.
The Sheridan season at the Gaiety has been a financial
success. We can’t make this out, anyhow we try it.
More celebrated, if not more justly celebrated, actors
have played here to audiences of dummies and dead-
heads. Is it that the taste of the public is changing ?
Very possibly, wc think, but notin that direction. No,
neither of these things could have been the cause of
this success. What then ?
• • •
It was a very acute and far-seeing thing on the
part of Mr. Sheridan to engage the services of Mr, J,
H. Eainford. Mr. Rainford always attracts the public.
We won’t say whether as a publican or as an aetor; but
it is noticeable that those who see him draw beer rarely
go to see him aot, and those who go to Fee him act
seldom go to see him draw beer. It would spoil the
illusion, y®u know. But a lot go to soe him. auyhow.
Even these, however, are only human, and could not
have gone night after night. Something else must be
found to account for the full houses. Was it the
wreathed smiles of Frank Towers, Sydney Hall, and
J. C. Cox,on the front,that ‘'got” them? We have
seen these smiles, and we don’t candidly think so.
• • •
Then, what in thunder was it ? Perhaps, it was
the never-failing attraction of the Pitti Paiaco scone-
paintings. These arc wonderful-looking things, by the
way. If they were taken down, framed and brightened
up a bit, they might be sold for original old masters.
They are too aged-looking in thsir present state to pass
for specimens of any school of art later than the woad-
painting period and too pra-perspcctive in style to bo
like anything modern, except perhaps the sturgeon-bone
scratchings of the Esquimaux iehthyophagi on th®
beach-mud of the Greenland sea. They are very
gloomy in idea, so gloomy in, fact, that one is left to
waver between the theory that they nro copies from
sketches made with the edge of bib manacles by a con-
detuned criminal on his dungeon wall on tho night
previous to bis execution, or, tho other equally cheerful
alternative, that they must have been photographed
from the bas-reliefs cut out of the rocky sides ol a
catacomb by a tomb-dwaller, whose ohiy light td wdfk
by was a dead man's finger blazing in a nldrderer’s
skull. Scenes of this sort are not calculated to fill tris
mindset the spectators with that gay and buoyrnt
feeling which should be present as a foil to the intensity
of the plav itself. Two of them, however, are not so
bad, inasmuch as they are suggestive of domestic
associations and homely joys. One is an enlarged
picture of a crocodile dinner-pUte—by a Chinese artist,
we presume ; the other is the real skeleton of an oil-
cloth kitohen-table-oovcr.
• • •
But wo don’t think that the audiences were
attracted by these old horrors. People are now on
what might be called terms of free-and-easy, though
frightful familiarity, with them, m>:oh as is the keeper
of a fossil show who rattles along the ribs of the
skeleton mammoth with one of its own broken bones,
in as cheerfully reckless a manner as a boy rattling the
railings of a dead-house with a silok. We give up try-
mg to think what made the season a success.
m m m
“Louis XI.” is the play we are going to deal
with. And right hero wo cm start away on a clean
coarse by saying that wo never saw Buckley in better
force tnan he was in this play. As Richard, he ex-
hibited a combination of statuesque speeohlessness
with dumb and dolorous drollery, such as we have
never in all our lives witnessed before Ho has a fine
frog-like wisdom of appearance, which renders him
invaluable for playing such characters as judges,
officers of the law, and so forth. Besides, be has a way
of standing out near the footlights, aud shaking his
head wearily to and fro, like a musing mule, that is pro-
ductive of mad overmastering Joy in the bosoms of
the audience. And, in addition to all this, he possesses
the Invaluable gift of being abe to wag his ears There
is, we are convinced, a great future before this talented
actor._ As in the physical, so in the psychical world,
there is plenty of outside in all m?n’s lives. We don’t
know exactly what we mean by this, but it sounds well.
And now for the minor characters.
• • •
Mr. Sheridan played the comparatively unim-
portant part of Louis XL He supported Buckley well.
So well, that we will start another paragraph to explain
ourselves farther.
• • •
Louis XI, at the period of the play, was a man
of broken body and worm-eaten mind. He was the prey
of a gloomy superstition, which, after he had committed
a crime, caught him by the throat, and, waving the torch
of fanatic terror before his eyes, showed him the shadow
of himself travelling by dark and bloody ways to hell.
And he clung to life like a bull-dog to a book-canvasser’s
leg. Mr. Sheridan threw out the adumbration of the
old scoundrel superbly. In one place, we remember par-
ticularly, he was matchlessly effective. This is where
he is frightened into his old fit of fears about dying, by
the prattle of one of the villagers, and Martha, a pretty
villageoise, trips up to dispel the impression. He is
trembling with terror at the instant she stands beside
him; then, seeing her beauty and hearing the music of
her voice, ho stretches out his hands, his voice quavers
and trembles along the whole gamut of feoling from
terror back to joy, until at last he draws her to him,
and kisses her on the cheek in the mumbling manner
that seems to be usual wiih aged gallants. We need
not say any more now, save that Mr. Sheridan’s Louis
XL is a performance we shall not soon forget.
• • •
Neither shall we soon forget Mr. Burton, who
stalks in on the stage in a brick-coloured blanket, and
curls everybody up with an irrelevant yell. He pla> s
Francois de Panic —a character of some consequence.
If the soul of Francois is one of those who, according
to an old tradition, have to wander up and down the
earth for a time, in order to purge away their sine, and
if Hall let him in, he will kill Mr. A. L Burton,
We suppose Mr. Burton can’t help talking as if he had
a sponge in his mouth, bat we wish he could.
• • •
The rest of the performers are just as good in
this play as they are iu anything else, and just as good
in anything else as they are in this. Which is not
meant to be sharp, mind you. but is intended to be
taken a& the simple truth. Most of the company are
thoroughly good actors within their lines and according
to their standards. They are, in addition, earnest and
painstaking. Mr. Ireland we have always spoken well
of. and always will, because it is no compliment to him
to tell the truth. Messrs. Joyce, M'Gowan, and Cates
are also well deserving of praise. And, for the ladies.
Miss Louise Davenport—who, by-the-way, played
Martha very gracefully in this piece—is clever, and will
be able to win her own way in the world, and Miss
Burton is, after all, a very nice actr.-ss, and looked
lovely in a dress of The maa who writes the Social
items for this journal has got a two days’ job of carry-
ing coals down on the wharf, and hasn’t got time to
tell us the technical names of dress materials, so we
shall have to call this snow-drift silk. And, now, we
think it’s about time that we had a drink.
* * * *
Zulu Thompson is in town, with Herman, who
was once a venlriloqui-t and a lieutenant, but is now a
lieutenant and an agent. We believed Mr. Herman
was at one tain's in command of the Tenterfield Tangle-
foots, in which regiment he distinguished himself by
carrying a duff-shop by storm under a heavy lira of
beans and gravy. Thompson shows his diorama at
Fred. Hanstead, Esq.’s (’’Young Dutchy ”) Academy
of Musio. The show will be moral, and, what is mere,
Zulu distributes a whole lot of things every evening.
There is certain, therefore, to be a big roll up of those
who have a soul above earthly things. We allude
cheerfully to the clergy. Aud this reminds ns that the
Lingarda had a smash up on the Indianopoiis railroad,
in which both air. and Mrs. Lingard were severely
bruised. This was owing to thoir not having come in
contact with one another for so long before. Soarrelle
was uninjured. Que Dieu soil remercie! And Tommy
Hudson writes ns, iu ink of a peculiar pallor, on
execrable paper, that he is doing big things in Xanachee
with Maven and Cottier He goes shortly to Ceylon,
thence to England for a new company far Australia.
Which recalls the fact that Mary Auderson’s favourite
amusement is smoking at her hotel window and expec-
torating on passing bell toppers. And as this paper
would be incomplete if we did not mention that Fred.
Holloway and the Missis have been giving “ The Mys-
terious Murder in the Strand" (111) at Xiama, and
that Ridge's Circus is at Jamberoo, we smilingly insert
that information. And getting down to the bottom of

There was an awful row at the Theatre Eoyal,
the other night. It appears that Frederick Hanstead,
Esq, and soma one in the tanglefoot line, pushed in
wituout “ parting," and on being informed by the
usher, through Hoodie, that it coat two half-crowns
each to tee “ The Mascotte,” they went downstairs
and called Goodie several things. G L. endeavoured to
remonstrate, but one of the parties landed him a “ a
domino in the kisser,” and several ushers, including
the gifted Moss, comm; to the rescue, things were
speedily made very lively. In the “ frarker as a
gifted newspaper proprietor would call it—Mose lost a
few inches of conchial bark and the tail of bis coat.
Freeman, the Adonis of the landing, got H on his dexter
peeper, and poor little Goodman—just off a sick bed—
was covered with blood, and not only bruised, but a
bruised—wa mean abused. Fred. Hanstead, E>q was
fined a fiver next morning, and there are about twenty
ao'ions and summonses pending against the other
party. Mr. Fred. Hanstead is known at Government
House and the Australian Club as Young Dutchy. So,
you see, we learn something even by a “ fraker ” at the
theatre.

Frank Towers is an enterprising young man.
He is preparing his Christmas bill with any amount of
energy, and, wo hope, on Boxing Night, everything will
be coulcur da 7'osc—or rather sonl«ur da Rosa. His bur-
lesque is to be called “Sinbad the Sailor,” and is an
entirely different thing from the version by Whitetia-
andspectacles, Esq., produced last year, at the Royal,
iu which we were told that
“ Williamson, Garner, and Muegrove, they say.
They’ve got the theatre from next May.’’
Mr. Towors’s “Sinbad” is by Frank W. Green, and
the local author of an unpublished drama who nos occa-
sionally contributed verse of a religious nature to the
columns of this journal. The oast will comprise Frank,
Rosa, Tom Buckley, May Vivian (who is very uicey-
picey iu burlesque), Johnny O’Neil, and novelal. Wo
hear the thing is very funnv. The local author called
to show it to us, the other day; but, being busy, we re-
(JaeSted him to Wait a bit. and g are him tho Shroud to
read on the doorstep. He immediately disappeared.

Lachlan M'Gowan ia going to New Zealand. He
is a nice little follow is Langhie—that’s as near as we
can gat to the spelling of his lovely name — and a very
available actor in special pirt*. Climes at a well-known
stage family, too. He called ronnd at the office to tsll
us all about it, but wo suppose we were out in our lan-
dau at the time. We always go about like this, now.
It makes us look like landauners.

Harry Simmons’ Company is now at Maitland.
They play there during the Christmas week. Their
season up country has been a pretty fair one, and would
hare better if it had sot been for the elections.
Poor old Leake, however, had bad lack—he had one
eye nearly scooped out by the branch ef a tree in the
bush. We are sorry for this, because he is a good
actor and a good fallow.

'* Aladdin,” at the Royal, bids fair to be one of
the biggest things in a spectacular sense that has
ever been produced in Sydney The libretto is very
lively, and ssme of the songs Al, notably, “Nostrums"
sung by Eiobard Stewart, and " We’re going to do
withoat ’em,” allotted to Johnny Hall. There is also
a funny ditty “ Yon can’t get 'em,” the verses of wnioh
are distributed amongst tne principals, and there are
some pretty linos written to a splendid march by
Gierzo, and sung by the whole strength of the company
daring the march of the Jewelled Fairies. AUthtsa
soags have been written, and the book translated into
Australian for the management, by Mr. Harold Grey.,

Mrs. Langtry seems to be getting a good lot of
cruel chaff from the New York pipers. One, which is
run by a Mr. Pox. in the interest, we believe, of the
Hard-Shell Baptists, says:—“The Jersey Lily, the
Prince’s mash, will carefully conceal her big feet on her
first appearance. She is billed to play Hester Graze-
brook in ‘An Unequal Mitch ' to begin the agony, and
Heeter wears long skirts,...There is a piquant rumour,
evidently started by the management, to the effect that
while kiisi'ig her good-bye, the Prince bit her left oar,
and the snide aristocracy and imitation Englishmen of
New York will rush to detect the royal mark."

Marie Prescott, the gusher, who got 12,000
dollars out of the American News Company for an
article on her in Tom Orinqi/e, ia also having a rather
poor time of it. Miss Prescott appears by the evidence
to have been a good deal maimed, her latest venture
being a New York grocer. She, however, “ froze on ”
to Ernest Harrier, a journalist, but the two having a
row, Ernest gave his former sweetheart (which he spelt
“ sweetheart") a “turn" in the paper named. Marie
want in for the Mrs Bardell business in Court, weeping
over two children, the father of whom is not mentioned.
It appears she contracted a habit of writing love-letters
to soap over critics. A waggonful was produced in
Court, in sne of which she said to Harrier that she
would call round if ha sent his clerk out to Central
Park bat-shooting with a flint-musket. II any pretty
actresses, by the way, like to write ns love-letters, wa
invite them to do to. Please enclose a stamped
envelope for reply.

Harwood had a throw ia. There was an acci-
dent on the Hawthorn Bailway line recently, and in
fixing things up, the Government required to buy a
small strip of land. It belonged to the Duke of Piom-
bino, and he gave originally £23 for it He charged
Victoria £2500 only for the property. But then H. K,
was always patriotic.

Our Adelaide correspondent writes :—Wybert
Reeve’s season is at nn end. His last appearance on
the stage of our 1'ttle Boyal was made on Friday night.
It was his benefit. Miss Alice Deorwyn’s performance
on this occasion was remarkable — r«r Miss Alice
Daorwyn. She played the part of Florence Marigold,
in *' Uncle’s Wilt," with much grace. Which enables
one to say with a clear conscience that if she takes
common pains she is likely to improve. The latter
part of Mr. Beeve’s season here was a success Oa the
night in question he appeared on the stage between the
play and the after-piece to say a few farewell words,
and was so pelted with wreaths and posies, that he
looked like a statue of Priapus in a parterre There
was very much of the language of flowers in his little
speech, too Of course he had never been in any city
that be liked better than Adelaide in all his life, and he
would carry away with him a recollection of the oour-
tesy of its inhabitants that would never be obliterated
while life, &o. It would be interesting to know what
his private feelings would have been if be bad carried
away nothing but a “ recollection." Bat, in truth, he
deserved all the success he had. Just a parting
jingle—
O Mister Eeeve, we’ll miss your smile—
To lose you we axe grieved ;
We’ve bean be-Beeva-d a little while.
And now we are bereaved.
This comes all the harder now that we are to be deli-
vered over to mystery, blood, revolvers, chamber-
panelled sewers, and Grattan .biggs. Here is the fear-
some programme. First, “ Tlio Irish Dstootive,"
—which, by the way, opened to a good house, —then
“ Ireland as it Was," “ Josh," and finally—this is a
blood-curdler—an entirely new and romantic drama
entitled “ Grasp," by H. W. Emmett. The Registrar
has applied for an assistant in anticipation of the
increase in the death-rate which the production of
these dreadful dramas will bring about.

The Mascotte girls have been immortalised.
Mr. Wood, the photographer, has shown us a series of
twenty “frames," wherein they are represented in all
torts of poses, from the graceful uprightness of an
cread to the ravishing recumbence of an odalisque
The outlines are wonderfully sharp, and even the
texture of the garments worn by the girls has come out
as clear as frostwork. The principal characters have
got each a frame to themselves. We certainly think
that these are seme of the finest “ professional ’’ photo-
graphs we have ever seen in this country.

We were in a sorrowful fix last Saturday night.
Having grown so accustomed to going out 1o one or
other of the theatres, we find it impossible to stay in
tbe house. And there waslnothing new on in the way
of plays. A suggestion from the missus that we should
goout marketing with her and carry home the Sabbath
sausages was received with savage scorn. Where could
we go, anyhow ? And then on a sudden, we thought of
the popular concerts at the Temperance Hall. We
would go there. We went.
• • •
When we informed the man at the door who we
were he showed us a feat with that sort of caressing
but distrustful politeness which one accords to a dan-
gerous lunatic who may get a fit at any moment and
smash things. Then he handed us a little tea-paper
programme, and we thanked him with such ferocious
suppress# went that he turnt-d round terror stricken and
flea back to the door where he stood shivering lixe the
man who asked Cyril (where art thou now, O mouldy
seer ?) to call up for him the spirit of his father and
was shown the septie of a mule The audience was not
large, but select. A bushy-haired young lady, whom
wa judge from the height of her heels and the profusion
of her silver jewellery to be either the eccentric
daughter of an Earl or the heiress of a Sussex-street
hash-house, sat in front of us chewing taffy and ap-
plauding ail the time, while a milk-feiced young mnn,
attired in what was doubtless considered down in his
alley the height of fashion, sat beside her and watched
the movement of her jaws with speechless adoration.
Evidently they were lovers. New and then he would
gaze furtively round to see thatno one was looking and
then press her massive but honest hand with the tender
energy of affection. Our eyes swam with tears as we
watched these little manoeuvres and thought of our
own romantic youth and Ann Mariar. But Ann Msxiar
fell from a top story window she was cleaning one day
and broke her blessed neex. We still cherish the por-
trait of a piece of her which was found in the next back
yard. Fortunately, our present missus can’t read.

Bnfc wo mustn’t allow these mournful memories
to make us forget the Show. We came in just as an
unshaven map was Binging a song, the words of which
we could not catch, bnt which War believe t© have been
very touching, because everybody wept. He had a
really good voice tor all that. 'linen appeared one
Harry Jaokaon, who wan desoribed on Wfre BMls as ** the
famous comique” or something, and sans another aorp<
at which everybody laughed—a kind of mechanical
laugh, though as if they h\d paid their picmey to V*>
amused at something, and settled themselves Awn to*
it with a grim determination of despair. Mr. Jfleksom
however, acquitted himself a good deal better Man*
some singers of mere pretend >b we have listened to in
more fashiouablepltces before now. But truth com pel a
ns id adm.t that these singers had little else than pre--
tension. After this Mr. El wards s n? “Hear me
gentle Maritana,” very well indeed. He might have
sung it even better if he had not, appxrcntiy, been
nnder the impression that Maritana was deaf, or at
Woolloomooloo, or in a trance at the time. Then Mr.
Somebody else sang another comic song, whiehhe evi.
dently thought was too comic for the audience as ho
buried the funniest parts of it in his hat. Oh, we can
tell you there was some rare old fun at this entertain-
ment. Even a concertino solo was not wanting to fill
up the cup of joy. But here we deem ir. our duty to
censure the heartless conduct of some person or
persons who smuggled a sick cat into the instrument.
It was unfair to the talented musician, cruel to the cat
and very near fatal to the audience. Thee musical
director should be careful that no such practical tekea
are plajei in future.
* * * *
We would like to have sat the show out, but-
dared not. Our taste for this kind of thing has been
neglected, and we reckoned it better not to risk too
much revelry in one night. We will go round as soou
as our new plate armour is ready. And, by the way, we
must not forget to state that Mrs. Colborne Eraser, of
Bed Biver, Manitoba, was the accompany ist.
• • *
Finally, while we believe the intention of the
promoters these Popular Concerts to be good to tho
verge of sanctity, we don’t think they have yet hit on
the right method of “corralling” the people. And,
worse still, we can’t advise them how to do it, unless
they were to engage what is left of the Bed {stocking
Minstrels. Bnt we arc afraid the enormous expense
this would entail would be too much for the manage,
ment. It is a hard thing to make innocent amusement
profitable.

Last Thursday, the Sydney Liedertafel gave?
their third conce.-t in the Protestant Hall, tho place
having been thoroughly fumigated after the Salvation
Harmy Heutertaiument and all tho h’s having been
carefully swept up and piled in tho rubbish-box to-
gether with three of Pastor Allen’s pant-buttons,
“busted” off during his last oration. Miss Kate
Thayer was the star, and so was MalloweP, who smga
capitally when he hasn't got to act. Miss Thayer gav«
an aria from the “ Magic Flute,” and afterwards what
the dear old Bum calls, “ The Nightingale's Thrill.”
Being encored, sue then sang “ Molly Bawn.” Misa
Thayer was much applauded. We might, however,
gently suggest to this lady that there is hardly any
need for her to open her month so wide Lodgings ara
plentiful in Sydney at the present time. Mrs. Haxry
Woods was also very successful in showing by her exe-
cution in Chopins’ andante spiniato all that mechanical
skill can do with the piano Cnopin’s piece interested
the Shroud man vastly. He thought andante spiniato
meant underdone spinach. Mr. Hallewell shaped very
well in “Nancy Lee,” but not so well in the “Erl
King." Mr F. M Qaade played a beautiful duet with
Mrs. Woods, in whicn he was allowed a piano all to
himself. After the piece was over, Huenerbein looked
glum, and, nudging Herr Peohotsch, murmured, “ J\Tou
piano n'en reviendra pas 1” Altogether, it was very
nice. There is only one thing, by the way, longer than
a Liedertafel concert. That is an eloeutiou&ry stance
by Henry W. Chapman.

A lot of—or several —people will remember
De Belleville, a junior member ot the London Comedy
Company, who was first brought into notice by being
hit in the eye by Garner at Adelaide. Well, F. Do Belle,
ville is now leading man of the Union Square Company,
New York, and has just distinguished himself by shunt,
ing the Mrs. De Belleville whom he took away from
Australia, and who was very nice, indeed, and has made
a new Mrs. Belleville (genuine this time) of a Miss
Pferdner. The other Mrs. De B. can’t see this little
arrangement, and is giving Frederick a variety of turns,
Tho Chicago papers are very facetious over it, and from
what we read we are of opinion that Mr. Da Belleville
stands a very fair show of again being brought into
notice by getting another hit in the eye.

The “ Eoyal Middy” has been played to good
audiences at the Opera House during the week. One
change was made iu the cast—in addition to the change
of Beaumont for Harding—which, we think was a piece
of brickheaded injudicieuanesa on the part of some-
body. Of course, we don’t mean to insinuate anything
against the judgement of the discreet as delightful
Emelie, or hint even in a whisper anything that would
savour of a reflection upon the wisdom of her manager,
pretty Casselli. No, we place the whole of the blame
upon the shoulders of the scene-shifters. They are
used to burdens and responsible for changes. And they
can stand it. Briefly, the substitution of Miss Annie
Leaf for Miss Madeline St. Clair, was, wo consider, a
very ill-advised thing. The latter young lady sang iu
time and tune, and was persotally pretty. The former
is, we regret to say, for her sak*. neither pretty nor a
cultivated singer. We are not taking up the gauntlet
for anybody just now — we have quite enough fights of
our own on hand. This matter we simply mention in
passing. Otherwise, the show is very fine. “ Fatinitna’*
will be produced on Boxing Night.

Mr. Henry Copeland, M.P.
Our portrait this week is that of Mr. Henry
Copeland, one of the members for Newtown.
Mr. Copeland’s career in this colony is pretty well
known, and so likewise are his political opinions.
In Parliament Mr. Copeland was the valiant
champion of freedom and progress. He is one of
the men whose shadow haa been on Sir Henry
Parkes for the last five or six years, and the
Government sustained no more bitter defeat than
in his return over Mr. Poster for Newtown. It is
pretty well known that Sir Henry Parkea
carefully avoided conflict with Mr. Copeland
during the whole ot last Parliament. The
opening of the Art Gallery on the Sunday, and
the general declaration in Parliament against
political holiness are due to the efforts of Mr.
Copeland, and in many other ways he has shown
himself an independent and resolute reformer.
Newtown has committed .ta representation to
good hands.
The Victorian subscriptions to the Craswick
Widows* and Orphans* Fund have reached nearly
£10,000.
Professor Stanich yesterday received official
notification of his appointment as aurist to Ills Ex*
cellency the Governor, Eord Augustus Ijoftus.

PEPPER AND SALT.
We have received, and read, with much interest I
a number of The Mornins Bum, a paper which is I
understood to bo issued in this city dally. It tells I
us that "Messrs. M’Blhone and Longhuan (««);
were elected as members for the Upper Hunter I
and also that " Mr. E. (sic) Shepherd, who was formerly
a member of the Assembly, has also been defeated.”
To it we are indebted for the information that, at the
L’edertafel, " A song from * II Flauto Magioo,’ and the
•Nightingale’s thrill,* (sic) were snug by Miss Kate
Thayer; and we further learn by the same issue (Fri-
day’s) all about the “ Friendly Societie’s (sic) report.”
Continuing in this pleasant strain, we are told in this
ga’a issue that “ Mr. C. E. Eiddle (sic) is secretary to
the Union Club;” and also that Mr. C. J. Eoberts,
C.M.G., M L. A , is a supporter of the Government I In
the Victorian Parliament, it faostiously tells ns that
Mr. (sic) MacMahon rose to address the House, bnt
wis ruled out of order by the Speaker” —a curious
mistake for a Melbourne paper to make, truly I The
Shroud has also come out as a comic journal, and one
of its “ humorous ’’ writers, speaking, we suppose, of
a recently escaped lunatio, remarks: ** Says a chap to
me the other day, ‘I always takes the Tribune;
there’s some good things in it sometimes, and
I likes the look of the editor.” And a travel-
ling reporter (what a treat it must be travelling
fir the Shroud!) writing of Tumnt or some place,
rruinously says: “ The hospital—which is in the centre
of a nice garden, shaded by some beautiful trees I
visited in company with mine host of the Commercial
Hotel, Mr. J. O. Phillips.” We havo really derived so
much amusement from the perusal of these two comic
papers that we are sorry they are so indifferently sup-
ported by the public. Why—but let’s have the usual
jaw’s harp jingle
So a lot of Hampton Court Palace is burnt down !
Tant pis/-which we would impress upon the Shroud
people is a Dutch term for pease-pudding. TVs knew
Hampton Court well. Wo used to go and see an aunt
there, who had been awarded three rooms and a pension
for writing a pamphlet on the “ Principles underpin*”
something which has escaped our memory. She was
a snuffy old lady, and used to send each ef the Eoyal
Family a poem on their birthdays. Onr aunt, however,
is now gathered to her uncles, and her suite is ocenpied
by an old party who wont to several battles to keep the
Commanders-in-Chief up to the mark-in their spelling.
Dickens, in •' Little Dorrit "—the most ingenious of all
his novels —makes Clennam visit Mrs. Qowan there,
and delightfully describes the place. Here is tome of
what he says" Ganteel blinds and make-shifts were
more or less observable as soon as the doors were opened5
screens not half high enough, which madedining-roomt
out of arched passages, and warded oft obscure corners
where footboys slept at night with their heads among
the knives and forks; curtains which called upon you to
believe that they didn’t hide anything; panes of glasi
which requested you not to see them ; many objects ef
various forms, feigning to have no connection with
their guilty secret, a bed; disguised traps In walls,
which were clearly coal-cellars ; affectations of no
thoroughfares, which were evidently doors to little
kitchens. Mental reservations and artful mysteries
grew out of these things. Callers, looking steadily
iato the eyes of their receivers, pretended not to smell
cooking three feet off; people, confronting closets
accidentally left open, pretended not to see bottles;
visitors, with their heads against a partition of thin
canvas, and a page and a young female at high words
on the other side, made believe to be sitting in a
primeval silence." Delicious this, is it not ? And se
true 1 Oh. and by-tbe-way, as “ the noticeable man with
grey eyes" is to be the next Minister for Public
Instruction, we hasten to remark that Cardinal Wolsey
lived at Hampton Court Palace. He—er—doesn’t live
there now.

Editors go, in very straight language, for men
who are parasites on the community in America.
This is what an Arizona journalist says of the local
candidate for C.M.G-ship" What is written below is
intended solely for a man, or rather an apology for one,
called Pat Hamilton. Pat Hamilton, you are a liar, a
blackmailer, and a coward. A liar by instinct, a self,
declared blackmailer, and a coward, because you are
afraid to resent an insult. Pat Hamilton, yon are a
loafer, because you have never earned an honest dollar,
and a enr because you are not a fit associate for a
respectable dog. This is enough, Pat Hamilton, to
make you assert your manhood, if you have any, and I
am in this office at stated hours, and have but one road
by which I travel to and from my home.” Of course,
they met and fought. Law don’t settle that sort of
thing in America. Here, now, it would be different. A
man called all those names by a newspaper would go to
court, and after he’d clearly proved by a host of wit-
nesses that he was all he had been called, a considerate
fossil of a judge and a docile jury would give him as
much money as he liked to ask for.

"What can be the matter with the Poet Offioo'P
Is it something in the air, or are the clerks demoralised
by continually handling religious papers ? Here we
have another "well-connected" young man committed
for trial for stealing money from letters. About Walter
M’Clintock being "well connected” there can be no
doubt whatever. He had Bill Eoberts and Henry
Heron, Esq, to defend him. Thers Is a rumour
that one of Walter’s relations is so very high np in-
deed that there would be an off chance of bars end
gyves for even mentioning his name. Mr. M*Clinteck,
however, doesn’t appear to have had any "beastly
pride" about him. A simple clerk in the Dead Letter
Office, he didn’t even " play at concerts ” like the
pious fraud, Healey, (at present in limbo), nor “ attend
chnrch regularly ” like another post official martyr we
could same. According to Detective Abbott, Mr.
Walter only played np. Wo don’t know whether Mr.
Abbott’s evldenee is conclusive in establishing the
charge, but we hope not. We shouldn’t like to see
inether young man, who is “ well connected” sent to
prison. It is whispered that M’Clintook is a bit off
his Kadoova. Very likely. It is only natural the poor
boy—being well connected—should be just a bit un-
settled now, We hope, however, that he will soon
regain his usual health. We really don’t know, m this
silly little affair—this absurd police bungle—whom to
sympathise with most—the young man who is well
connected or his well-connected connections.
They are always doing something to our old
friend, Alick—formerly of St. Petersburg, bat now of a
suburban coal-hole. This time they have been anoint,
ing him with "holy oil.” A Moscow priest was
chartered for this interesting ceremony, and led blind-
folded to the Emperor’s subterranean dwelling. When
well-greased, Alick signed something, and having re-
warded the holy naan with a kopeek, pronounced him-
self erownod, and said that Heaven looked down on the
event. The noble Monarch’s youngest-boni is to be
confirmed shortly. This fact has leaked out in cense,

AMONGST THE FAIRIES.
They were seated on the kerbstone, alternately
comparing slices of bread and dripping and discussing
the political situation. One was a jonng lady of some
ten or twelve summers, who was attired in a brown
cloth skirt (which had apparently been cut out of the
seat of her father’s pants), a straw hat with a green bow,
brass buckle and no perceptible brim, and a pair of
stockings which would have been roomy for John Lucas.
She wore, also, a diminutive jacket of sad, not to say
gloomy aspect; and a moment’s glanee at her caused the
contemplative bystander to become embarrassed in the
perception that she was shod in the bluchers of her
brother. The companion of this young lady was of
smart, even rakish appearance. She evidently
aspired to style. Though reared in the bread-and.
dripping section of the community, she had a soul
above it, and, though of tender years, yearned evidently
tor the steak and oyster phase of existence. Her dress
was a gorgeous spectacle in one so young, being a brown
rep trimmed with bugles, a brown hat with a desperately
wounded feather, and a pair of black dancing shoes,
which had apparently been originally worn by Esme-
ralda in the pas seul in which she “got" the giddy
Archdeacon. The kerbstone on which these ladies sat
was that in which Hoskins Place abuts upon Castle*
reagh-street, in the immediate vicinity of that noble
building which was, up till quite lately, sacred to the
manufacture of journalistic hash.
• * *
Hoskins Place has a distinct individuality. There
is a repose about this thoroughfare which is not to be
found elsewhere. It consists of two rows of little
houses painted, by a happy inspiration of the landlord,
a fiery red. There is no footpath to speak ef,
and the gified architect of the buildings was evi*
dently opposed, on conscientious grounds, to the con-
struction of eh her balconies or verandahs. But to
counterbalance these disabilities, there are lotsoi dust-
boxes always to be found in the gutter, and the
aromatic odour of fried fish floats perpetually
upon the Hoskins breeztM. To the uninitiated a mystery
would seem to pervade this retreat. Not only are the
blinds nearly always down, but the adult inhabitants
are rarely visible. In the morning, silence reigns
supreme in the street. Tno milkmen know the tricks
ot the doors and shutters, and bring out half-pint jugs
from cunning hiding-places, departing without arousing
theinmates. At night the houses are fast closed, the
“kids'* are reposing, and no sign of life is visible. The
place being a cul de sue, there is—we quote one of
Alfrei’s most elaborate phrases—no “vehicular traffic"
neie. From tour to six in the afternoon is the only
cime at which Hoskins Place awakens into even com-
parative activity. Then the will play
;here, and the ice-cream man do a brisk business.
Sallow men will confer with each other in deep voices
at half-opened doorways, and ladies who have “slipped
on" ted petticoats and forgotten their stockings dart
constantly across Ihe road borrowing baking-powder
and box-irons. This is a busy time with them. For
they all belong to the “ perfesh,” one way and another.
Two columbines live in one house with their mother,
who comes on as “ first mob ’’ in spectacular pieces,
and, next door, is a costumier—a lady—whose husband
“ rumbles ’* deeply in opera choruses. A scene-shifter
lives opposite, whose two daughters, being efsymmetri-
oal build, pose as impossible pages on either side of
stage monarchs, and not represent the
flower of the Scottish aristocracy, in bed-cur-
tain rotes, at Macbeth’s banquet. All the Hos-
kins Place people are essentially theatrical. They
cling to the theatre as to a rock, and would
rather work for thirty shillings a week cn the
stage than for double the money in any other sphere of
employment. Their children are the same. Their
world is the world of perukes and spangles, and they
can lisp histrionic slang before they can express their
dislike—singularly professional—for soap and water.

On the kerbstone, then, they were seated, and,
as we passed, the y oung lady in the Esmeralda suppers
said, “Could yer tell us the toime, mister P" “ Ten
o’clock," we replied, with the smiie that has done such
good service, and yet is still in the full zenith of its
power. “ Time to slide, then, Jane Ann," remarked
our interlocutor, rising hastily, and thereby displaying
a Columbinish quantity of hose, and a heartbreaking
amount of very foggv underskiit. “Where are you
going, ladies F" we inquired. “Can >cu sling ua a
sprat, mister inquired Jane Ann, evading the quee-
ti-n. The “sprat" having been duly “slung," we
walked on with our newly.made friends in the direction
ot the theatre. On the way, they bought cherries and
cakes ot a forbidding aspect, and were condescendingly
communicative. “Annie" told us that she was Jane
Ann's cousin, and that both of them were always “look
on" at Christmas time, because they were used to it.
••‘Took on’ where? ’ we inquired. “ At the theatre,"
was the reply. At this moment we were all hard by the
pit-passage ot the Royal. “ Then you are " wa fal-
tered. “ ** hy, bloomin’ fairies, of course,” yelled Jane
Annand in another moment they were wildly whoop-
ing down the lane, and had disappeared through the
stage door.
« • •
There was a “ call ” for “ principals, band, and
chorus" that day. We found this out flora a tall
person known as “Moss," who sits, in a distressing
condition tit whisker, in the inner-office all day, selling
tickets for the night’s admission. The office of the
Theatre Royal, by the way, is a dread and mystic spot.
It is about half the size of a Dawes’ Point 'bur, and
about twice as clean. There is a very small door, which
is never quite open amd never quite shut; and hanging
about th»s portal is generally to be found a choice
bouquet of professional flowers—all more or less in a
condition of nervousness, consequent upon the uncer-
tainty “hanging" to their applications for engage-
ments. In the solitary chair iu the office is to be seen
seated that gorgeous theatrical potentate, Mr. George
Mnsgrove. There Is much interest attached to George,
both inside and ontside the profession. Bearded meu
whisper his name with awe; lovely women pronounce
it amidst a battery cf sighs. Amongst his species, Mr.
Mnsgrove may be said, on one point, to stand alone.
Like the Man with the Iron Mask (slow music, please),
he has never been seen to smile,
* * *
Hut there are lots of “ proa.” who lounge about
the theatre for many hoars who, by reason of their
position in the profession, are not only strangers to
nervousness, but put ou a deal of what is popu-
larly known as “ marmalade." The stand of
these histrionic exotics is under the portico of the
dress-circle, and their banut is George Eastway's, next
door. Look, now, at that tall, rather atont gentleman,
with a fresh complexion, a tawny moustache, and a
light suit of immaculate out. He is smoking a cigar
and talking about lager. Now glance towards Kmg-
otreet, and you wiu observe many ladies passing
ana repassmg, all of whom appear to take a very
large amount of mttjest in the architectural beauties
of the theatre. Borne of these are in carriage-,
but mere are on foot. All, however, gizu
with molting earnestness in the same direction, btay
now! What hare we here? A handsome single
brougham, by the gods ! It stops at the box-office, and
a very elegant lady alights and purchases two seats
from the be-whiskered official. Bhe, doesn’t require
any places, (or she cannot go that night or any other
night, in consequence nf her many engagements.
“Tour change, madam.” “Oh—er—thank yon." A
half a glance as she trips out ef the corridor, and a
whole one as ske skips into her carriage. But all this
time the stout gentleman is standing stolidly there dis-
cussing the merits ot lager, and fondly dwelling on the
virtues of clams—the clams of his native esuntry !
The stout gentleman is, of course, Signor Verdi,
the fascinating baritone I

Through the vestibule and into the theatre.
Gloom. High np above the pilot light burns amidst a
tracery of grimy glass work. The theatre is in
swaddling clothes—and very cloudy ones. It looks
very ghastly and very grim. The crystal chandelier
appears like a big fish-basket with a candle inside, and
the dress-circle is liko unto a graveyard in which a

stalls are seated a number ol ladies. In the distance
they look ghostly, but on approaching they appear nn-
deniably substantial. Here, now, is a lady elegantly
attired in chameleon silk. Her face is in classic repose,
and her costume perfect. There is about her
“ Mother Hubbard” a peculiarly artistic finish, which
savours of a fashionable milliner. Who is this?—the
Countess of Campbelltown ? or the Duchess of Dubbo ?
Neither, in good sooth! This is a chorus lady from
“ La Mascotte.” It is evident that she has solved the
problem of “How to Dress Like a Lady on £25 a
year." Bnt life is too short to go into these things 1
In tho next row is a fair one in a light print. That is
Maggie Stewart. Maggie has been playing a page who
says something in “ The Mascotte,” and before going
away has oome to see how her sister “ shapes ” at
rehearsal. There are a number of other young ladies
there—mostly chorus—many of whom appear to have
solved the problem of the lady in chameleon. Many
these captivating choristers are very fond of ovsters,
and cabs, and Sandringham And they get them all —
including jewellery. Yes—they must have solved it! 1

On the stage. Confusion. Some men are saw-
ing scenery ; others—instructors—are sawing the air.
There is a table at the extreme end of the O P. side,
upon which are a number of papers, and before which
i« seated a gentleman in a light suit, with legs on the
Woodfleld plan, who is busy writing connecting couplets
for the printers. That ia tho Sydney author. In the
centre of the stage, with his hands up to his head in a
despairing attitude, ia a very pleasant-lookinggentleman
in dark grey, who ia trying to hold in hand about 75
people, the combined chattering of whom tends to make
a taearns that would awaken—or stun—the Seven
Sleepers. This is Mr. H. H. Yineont, the redoubtable
Ramirez, stage-manager to the Pantomime. “ Silence,
Indies, if vou please. Now dance. all of you. Like this.
Now." They do it, and do it wrong, and do it again a
good deal worse. Then, at last, they get it. But, by
this time, the stage-manager is hot and dusty ai d tired
—bnt not angry. Oh, no I Harry never lost Lis tonarer
but once in his life, and as his mother-in-law found it
he has been unhappy ever since.

In Fairyland at last, and a land of bustle,
truly. In some parts tbe full depth of tho stage is
exposed to view, ia others a bit of a palace hangs nere,
and here is a bit of a rustic landscape. Ah I hero now is
a brave figure, with military moustache and an imma-
culate get up. This is the funny man who went
" waltzing round with Charley ” in the pantomime last
year. Johnny Hall. He is full of fun and merriment,
having “broken tho back" of a huge part, which he
holds in his hand ; for Johnny plays the great r6ie in
the pantomime "Aladdin"—Ab«uazer the Magician
But he need be happy, anyhow. For standing near him
is Miss Jessie Grey, whom Johnny married witn “no
cards, no cake, bnt lots of fan," quite recently. Mrs.
Hall makes a pretty figure. She has a delightful morn-
iug dress of flowered pompadour, and a hat that was
made to devastate the human heart. We say •• When
the golden bars of a summer sunset shed their glow
upon the perfumed rose, then it is likened unto ,”
when she says " Horry to interrupt you; bnt canyon
tell mo where I can get a pair of shoes with heels like
these ?” Crushed! This tall, thin gentleman, with the
black hat is Sam Pool©, the great aboriginal delineator.
Ho plays Sa-Sli, and Johnny Hall laughingly tells him
that he has got all the "fat" of the piece; whereas, he
drily retorts that he considers the pantomime “ a night
with Johnny Hall." That stout old gentleman standing
hy a stout and not very young lady, is Dick Stewart.
The lady is Miss Docy Stewart, his daughter—an
actress with whom we were desperately ia love
twenty years ago. But who is this vary nice little
lady in a white dress, with her hair curled tightly into
a crop upon her head P She has a bine doable eye-glass
at her waist, and a gold brooch with “ Good Luck " on
it at her throat. This is Maggie Knight, and she will
enaot the title-role, Aladdin. Having always held trne
histrionic talent reverentially, we watch Miss Knight
into a corner where the flre-buokots are, and say,
“ Miss Knight, there has not been, since the immortal
Rachel aroused in the breast of her hearers the fire of
enthusiasm, an actress whom wo can comp — ,’’ when
sho remarks sweetly “ Do you know where I can get
a pair of plain Chinese shoes for tht» first act ? I think
the price would be about three-and-six.” We murmur
a hoarse negative, and slide—not to say slink—away.

But, look here ! Sitting in the second entrance
on the prompt side is a young girl in black, who is alter-
nately biting her nails and worrying an orange. That is
Miss Tilly Lake, the Columbine. Next to her is Mias
Grace Henriques, an attractive young person, who has
been known to score great success in the parts of speech-
less confidantes and to be enthusiastically received in
the r61e of bedizened princes, who, emulating the ex-
ample of the legendary parrot, think a deuce of a lot
but say nothing Miss Henriqnes only plays a very
little part in "Aladdin," but the confidence of the
management is with her. She possesses the inestim.
able art of spreading herself out so as to look a great
deal.

“ Clear the stage, ladies.” Thus Mr. Vincent.
What is this ? Smoke coming np from the orchestra.
Fire ! Mr. Bice, the leader, vacates the chair hastily,
and Musgrove and Goodie rush in from the office. Up
comes the smoke. The first fiddle wheezes, and the
clarionet coughs. The flooring of the orchestra is taken
np, the hose is quickly payed out from the at.'ge, but
nothing can be seen —except smoke. Suddenly some
one runs in, and breathlessly says it’s all right. It was
only the cook next door at the fish-shop who had fallen
head first iato the oyster-stew, and tha steam from the
kitchen had got into the theatre. Taking a
chair, wa then settle down to watch the fairies. We
feel that it is a delightful thing to be in fairyland; hue,
at the same time, we could wish that the big toes of
some of the fays had not been so painfully prominent,
and that some of the pixies, in passing, had neither
munched mutton-pies nor emitted a paradaisioal per-
fume of that goblin nectar known to ns worldly
grovellers as “ tanglefoot.” One lightsome flatterer
had an undecided white skirt, a decided black eye, and
a polonaise of tea-leaf after a long infusion. Another,
who would have turned tha scale at 160 lb , had a blue
skirt on, shoes on the waterman’s wherry system,
fastened on with an ingenious arrangement of calico,
pink tights, and a fog-coloured j ickot. Another came
out in a white pompadour dress of the weak before
last, barber’s-pole stockings, and a hat calculated to
arouse suicidal feelings in tho human heart There was
a fairy in black, too, of attractive aspect, who seemed of
a rather reckless disposition; and a piotty pale-facod
fay in grey, who didn’t seem to care about it. Then
there was Miss Barlow, a lady contortionist, in a red
satin 15 inen skirt, who led one division of the dancers;
and a little girl in black with a frizzy head, and a large
amount of animal spirits, who led another. Amongst
tho mass of girls and children upon the stige there
were a great many who were very attractive, and
even the fairy in the barber’s-polo stockings will light
up at night amazingly.
« * «
Wearying of the fairies, we went, after a while,
into the “ wardrobe ’’ to see the dresses. The wardrobe
is a a small square apartment looking on to Brougham
Place, and tno ; rending genius is Miss Nathan, a
stylish lady, m wboce sole cnarge are all the dresses of
the theatre. The co»iu>nts of "Aladdin" are truly a
wonderful spectacle, la a work-room near Mi»s
Nathan’s temple, nine or ten women are constantly
employed upon them; and as the management follow
up the plan—agood one—observed in " The Mascotte,"
oven the supers will he gorgeously arrayed. Before
leaving the wardrobe department—Mr. Mnsgrove’s
attention being diverted by his having dropped a pant-
fa atton and imagined it was a six-pence—we said to Miss
Nathan, confidentially : “ The exhibition of your great
genius has, we cannot deny, madam, made animpreo
sion upon oar hearts which ,’’ when sho excused
herself and said waa it true that a shop on Brickfield
Hill absolutely sold fresh butter at one and a penny a
pound. Wo then left —dejectedly.

A wonderful place is Fairyland ! We could tell
you of the great Gordon upstairs, in a coat liko Joseph's
—of many colours —evolving marv« l* of stage-piotui es
with colours which seem to be slapped on anyhow—
tho paint being contained in receptacles which, we
badeve, first suggested to the Etruscans their still-
ad ired vases. We could tell you all this, ladies and
gentlemen, and a good deal more, too, but a fairy voice
has just asked us to take something. We hasten to
sa y_with a vivid remembrance still upon us of that
umbrella, those pattens, and the abnormal length of
her tongue—that the voice proceeded from a male fairy.

A New Poet.
Recently there has appeared a volume of poems
by Beanel Bodd, a young Englishman, who is an apostle
of Swinburne, and who dedicates his book, Rose Leaf
and Apple Leaf,” to Oscar Wilde. Notwithstanding
this dedication, his verses are marked by peculiar
merits, and have excited attention in Engl jh literary
circles. Here specimens.
LONG AFTER.
I see your white arms gliding
In music o’er the keys ;
Long drooping lashes hiding
A bins like summer seas;
The sweet lips wide asunder.
That tremolo as you sing;
I could not choose but wonder.
You seemed so fair a thing.
For all these long years after
The dream has never died;
I still can hear your laughter,
Still see you at my side.
One lily hiding under
The waves of golden hair;
I could not choose but wonder.
You were so strangely fair.
I keep the flower you braided
among th ■ S3 waves of gold ;
The leaves are sere and faded.
And, like our love, grown old.
Our lives have lain asunder.
The years are long, and yet
I could not choose bnt wonder—
I cannot quite forget.
DISILLUSION.
Ah I what would youth be doing.
To hoist his crimson sails.
To leave the wood-doves cooing
The song of nightingales.
To leave this woodland qaiet
For mourning winds a., strife.
For waves that foam and riot
About the teas of life ?
From still bays silver-sanded
Wild currents hasten down.
To rocks where snips are stranded
And eddies where men drown.
Far out, by hills surrounded.
Is the golden baven gate,
And all beyond unbounded
Are shoreless seas of fate.
They steer for those far highlands
Across tho summer tide.
And dream of fairy islands
Upon tbe farther side.
They only see the sunlight.
The flashing of gold bars.
But the other side is moonlight
And glimmer of pale stars.
They will not heed the warning
Blown back on every wind.
For hope is born with morning.
The secret is behind.
Wbirled through in wild confusion
They pass the narrow strait
To the sea of disillusion
That lies beyond the gate.

applied to one of onr Bonrke contemporaries fer a tem-
porary loan of two reams of paper, should we succeed in
getting them we will be in a position to issue a good
readable paper on tho I7th instant." If Jones goes on

butcher, serving rations, “ bay, Jack, this smells rather

Butcher: “Well, yes; but it’s better than the other
cows. One was caneared and t’other had pleuro, you
know.” to his mate, “Oh, dammit, Bill, we’ll
go next door." They go next door, where the bland
young storekeeper is waiting with a grin to serve them
with fish or ox-tongue at per tin. With the kindly aid
of the butcher, that talented young storekeeper ados
about £150 to his yearly salary of £25. And, of course,
the bnteher is not forgotten.
The champion burlesque-writer in embryo be-
longs to the Crown-street School. His father was
hearing his lessons at home, and when he had learned
from his offspring that 3 times 7 were 43 and 91 and II
and 63, he banged the scholar’s head with a moot and
said, " Go inside, dunce,” pushing him into the lumber,
room for the second time that day. Then he bawled
throogh the keyhole, “What do you think of that
eh ?’* “ I think," replied the boy-Burnand, " that this
is a strange go-inside-dnnoe.” Next day—in the

A man writes to a Temora editor complaining
that on the preceding night men were wandering about
from pub. to pub. almost in the condition of Adam
before Eve took to slop-making with gum-leaves. This
correspondent the editor very properly rebukes—say-
ing he is wrong to cavil at a “ little jollification at Car-
nivaltime,” We like this very muon; ana would rebuke
our correspondents in the same manner, if we dared.
Things would have come to a pretty pass, indeed, if you

Twin girls have been born in Oban (N.Z.)

Schools breaking-up in all dira-itiona. The

Hchool on the 15th, before a very large gathering. Mr,

coived a present. Same evening, Ht. Joseph’s Convent

number of parents and friends. There was also a long

Drought.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The blinding glare ot the orb of day
Blazed flary fierce where the homestead lay.
And the black cracked earth and parching sand
Showed there wa< drought upon the land.
For months and months no eye had seen
On that arid waste a tinge of green.
Save the stagnant pool that hourly sank—
Sank lmh by inch down tbe spongy bank.
Green slime on its dismal face did float
And carrion crows o’er the dead did gloat
With a ghastly joy; they had nought to fear,
For a dainty feast was outspread here
For them: the emu, the brave dead horse.
The cattle—every cow a corse.
The poisoned fish and the rotten sheep,
And the thousand slimy things that creep,
Creep through the eyes and mouths of the dead.
Lord! what. a banquet the Lord had spread
For His ravens ! He who can hear the sound
When even a sparrow falls to the greund.
Had slain with nought these goodly herds
In the sake of a few foal oarrion birds.
Yet He lets His poor—His dear poor—die
For want and hunger and agony.
Yet Ha hears the ruined settler groan
As by loss and debt he’s overthrown,
And sees him hope against hope in vain
And shuts His ears when he prays for rain,
Till swamped and buried in ruin’s tide.
He adds to tbe ranks of the suicide.
1 1 this God's wealth of love untold ?
Is this how He brings men to his fold ?
If it is we think the odds are level
That God is another name for Devil.
Pure bosh I Learn this, ye praying elves,'
That God helps those who help themcelves.

There are a lot of Italian priests in Queensland,
and that’s why " the olive ” is not cultivated there.
Religion has been at her usua’ “ Christian ”
tricks in a little town—no matter where. The Protes-
tant wife of a heavy Roman Catholic was sick unco
death, and, as a matter of course, an Episcopalian cleric
at once proceeded, according to his lights, to grant her
a free rasa to “ the land that is fairer than day." The
Romish priest and sundry nuns couldn’t however thus
lose a possible client, so they came along at the double,
“ran the rule” over the Episcopalian, and like light-
ning lodged the expiring and almost unconscious woman
in Purgatory. She was, of course, buried as a Roman
proselyte, and now all that remains is for the sorrowing
husband to plank his bottom dollar for masses, and
thus yank her inch by inch into Paradise. We don’t
know the chargo per inch. And this is Christian reli-
gion in this enlightened nineteenth century 1 When
ehall we, to quo'e Marcus Clarke, have “civilization

Dr. Vaughan has announced four advent ser-
mons at St. Mary’?, on the lollowing cheerful eul jeota
—Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell. This, we believe,
was the programme Lucifer ran on. The lectures
should “take well,” and “give pleasure to all." We
cannot imagine anything more attractive than 11 Hell,”
with magic-lantern slides and lime-light illuminations—
especially that scene of Dante’s, in which the damned
souls are whirled madly round in an immense maelstrom
of boiling pitch, whilst the funny little beggars of
devils roott on the banks, fish them up with boat-
hooks, and then turn them inside out and souse them
down again. “Snakes in ye.ur boots" is nothing to
reading Daate, or enjoying * Hell’ ”—at a distance. Df.
Vaughan gave a nigger-minstrel, holy Punoh-and-Judy
and pig show in St. Mary’s a while ago. We see no
valid reason why he shouldn’t run a panorama of hell
there now.

Our contemporary, the Distress, is jubilant
about the number of good Catholics in Fiji. Now,
we’ll just explain how they came there. The result of
a Wesleyan mission at Vanna Leva was that tke
principal chief became a child of grace. He made
goad progress in praying and singing, and was well to
the front in annual reports. Bui just when he was
gettirg fit to hold up as a shining example, it was dis-
covered that Cm Cakau had adhered with a more tbau
religions rigidness to a national eastern of his fathers,
for, scattered at convenient intervals over lis territory,
he possessed thirty or more wives It ceedn’t be said
wbat a hullabaloo was raised when it became known
that a pillar of the church indulged so extensively in a
luxury of which one item is often considered too much
Tui was admonished and adjured—ia vain I He quoted
Abraham, Salomon, and other giddy old patriarchs,
and couldn’t understand why they should have lots ot
jay, and he be restricted matrimonially. In tho height
of his perpLxity, a priest came along, and the old chief,
who hospitably lodged him, told his troubles. Tne
wily Roman insinuated that tho teachers of the “ lotu
wai wai ” (which, being translated, means “city
religion”) bad someulter or ol j ct, and gently suggested
that the “lota popi” (translate that yourself, dear
reader) never interfered with the domestic arrange-
ments of their patrons. Tae old chief lav it at onoe,
and decided -then and there to embrace tne accommo-
dating “ lotu popi’’ mj stery. He sent for a large con-
signment of little metal crosses, be ordered tbe whole
of his tribe to immediately change from * lota wai
wai” to “lotu popi;” and —he kept his wives. Bo
now, you understand, kij-nd friends, how, thanks to the
unremitting and noble efforts of the priests, there are
so many good Catholics in Fiji.
To a crammed house, on Sunday night, Mrs. E.
L. Watson delivered an oration cf singular power. The
title, “ Our Treasures ia Heaven,” was not a taking
one; it was suggestive of tracts about tho sin of doing
something that you never have the slightest wish to do,
which tho unhealthy-looking young man puts into jour
baud just when jeu’ro feeling pleasant, and curdles ail
your good humour on the spot, like thunder turns the
table bear... Briefly, our “ treasures” are to bo enlarged
capacities, iperfect reasoning and executive ‘ powers,
“another ob-uco.” the soul’s desire, truth, oeauty,
memory, sympathy, immortality. But, never mind the
title, '•*Mrs. Watson’s sermou was good, it was a fl w
of choice sentenogs adorned witu gems ot thought and
expression, a perfect control cf ideas, and command of
language, and sequence of argument. Never tripping
tho tongue, never halting for a word, with a strength
and freedom that riveted all she drew her terse word
pictures. With p iuted scorn she lashed the dry the-
ology that is served oat by well-paid parsons to those
who hunger for & living religion ; with impassioBed en-
treaty, vibrant voice, and flashing eyes she shredded
the flimsy creeds that so many mumble, so few really
acknowledge, and none at all understand; ond, with a
scathing satire that would pierce to the mind of the
densest orthodox dullard, she launched derision at the
invented superstitions, as childish, some of them, as
others ate cru d, which are even still clung to, but with
fast-failing hold, by the churches of to-day. Nocontimpt
was thrown on the natural religion of any; only at
what, in blackskinued islanders, we ourselves
arc the first to call heathenism. For instance:
“ According to old dogma, there is one named the
Devil, the great harvester, who reaps of human hie
abundantly, carrying countless millions into the dark
regions of death; while G ,d is but the gleaner, gather-
ing but a few thin sheaves of elected souls, to piaoe in
his little golden prison, and keep forever to his own
g'ory. Isthatso?” Again: “ You are di-tlinosly told
that it is not tho morality of man that saves mm, b it
his faith ; and the more you behove of that which yon
cannot understand, the s ifor you are ! ” About eternal
damnation for non-belief, or for falling ohort o' thi
laid-down standard ot excellence, Mrs. Watson burst
out: “Whatl with our little span ot time, our limit d
capacity, with no choice of birth or conditions of lify,
with our narrow humau view of thingr; arc we to
decide the question of etermt.i, and damu ourselvis
beyond all hope ? Nay, nay 1 God will not leave as so
much power.” And atier a desorip iou of Ihe
“treasures,” followed: “Bat ibis, you say, is too goo 1
to be true ? Not at all, ladies and gentlemen; msnv
things are too bad to be true, nothing is too good to ae
true. The fact of your imagining something go d is
God’s promise in tho sonl fulfilled.” Apart from ihe
question of spiritualism, it is seldom speakers of Mrs.
VVatson’a capabilities address a byduey audience.

Political Disturbance in Wollongong
Cemetery.
A tempest swept over Wollongong the night after
the election, and, to put it mildly, there was a
very disorderly scene in the graveyard. It is as
well to know at the outset that the dead are not
buried at Wollongong. When a respectable resi-
dent goes off the hooks, he is pitched on to the
sand heap at the bottom of the town, and bis
remains in a short space of time mix with those of
his friends of yore. Leastways, it looks like
this. In Wollongong cemetery, a person may
gather in fifteen minutes sufficient remnants of
skeletons, shrouds, breastplates, and other funeral
ewellery, to fill a coal truck. Skulls, shank-
bones, ribs, jawbones, &o., strew the ground in
happy profusion. At least forty shrouds, in a
wonderful state of preservation, are held fast by
tho sand, while the white remnants of humanity
which they enclosed lie scattered round ; and here
and there are the breastplates that fashion
supplies for the information of the worms. Tomb-
stones lie broken in every direction, or are totter-
ing like excited electors. A groat game with the
Wollongong lovers is to pull off the top of the big
brick tombs, and go down and poke fun at the
uncovered skeletons, while lounging in undis-
turbed ease on the back of an unoccupied coffin.
Remnants of the rich and poor are all round.
The ripe and wealthy maiden, followed to the
grave by hundreds, leaves to posterity the beauti-
ful shroud and the satin linings of her coffin ;
while the simple print dress which en-
veloped the form of infant poverty tells
the tale of sorrow in a different station. The
explanation of this extraordinary condition of
affairs ia found: first, in the action of the sea;
and, secondly, the inoperativeness of Purgatory.
The cemetery belongs to the Roman Catholics.
What was once a grass-clad mound is now a small
desert of shifting sand. The frequent storms of
successive years have uncovered the tomb, and,
long before the Judgment Day, the unfortunates
interred there have come out of their graves.
Money has been frequently subscribed to make
things right for the archangel, but the coin, it ia
said, has gone among the living, not the dead.
And so, to the disgrace of the denomination to
whom it belongs, tho old residents are bleaching
away on the sands. The relics are spread all over
the colony. Each travelling showman visiting the
town, who apes Hamlet, teizea a skull; and the
shank bones are used for lodge-room maces. The
Bulletin, when down at tho election, came
away with a trophy in tne shape of a bag of
bones —four fractured skulls, seven shanks, tour
collarbones, four pairs of ribs, a woman’s j iw.
the bones of a foot (eighteen inches), and a busin 1
of curly teeth. Those teeth are good for nothing
but palisades. The view given on page 8 shows
the ructions in the cemetery the night after the
declaration of the poll—a tempestuous night, with
the winds howling and tho billows roaring—and
the skeletons all glorious, apparently on colonial.
At 11 30 The Bulletin and The Herald repre-
sentatives crept down to the cemetery, and the
scene there, even at that early hour of the poll,
was certainly not creditable to either candidate
The pubs., is appears, had been thrown open, and
the liquor had run but the votes hadn't come.
There were some nasty references to certain peo-
ple turning their coats, or, rather, their shrouds,
and an excited educational voter named Dooltgan
hinted that a scrutineer had not paid his funeral
expenses. This scrutineer, James U’Bralligan,
thereupon charged Dooligan with having another
man’s pelvis, and occupying another man’s coffin.
This led to blows, and tne row on top caused
several to turn in their cherry-cases and come out
to vote The scene that ensued baffi id descrip-
tion. Four angry giants rushed round looking
for their skubs, and as many more were tearing
stolen limbs from one another. Toe O’Bralligan
party carried the day or rather the night; and the
candidate who opened the pubs, was defeated by
nearly two to one. Several strange skeletons,
evidently emissaries from tho Baptist graveyard,
endeavoured to stir up bad blood, but as it had all
been spilt, their base efforts proved futile. The
Baptists wore afterwards crushed with tombstones.
At 3 a.m., there was a sudden clearance, and
another disgraceful scene ensued, between two
ladies, over a coffin. A false cry of ‘’Here’s
tho police ” was raised; hence the clear-
ance. An hour later The Bulletin was busy
gathering relic', and they are now on view at this
office. It is said the scenes here depicted occur
after every election. We can’t speak, however,
on this point. All we can say is, that if the dead
could speak there’s many a man in Wollongong
who would blush with sham 3.

The Cruise of the White Blephant.
The 9th December will become memorable in the
naval annals of the colony as the da*e of the first
voyage of the squadron of the New South Wales Naval
Volunteer Artillery. The squadron consisted of the
good hulk Wolverene, and started to put out to sea at
half-past one p m,, bains', as the midshipmite of tho
Rum nautically puts it, “f illy oquipned with guns and
a full complement of hands.” Tula “ full complement"
consisted of the standing Crew of the Wolverene,
numbering 12 ( ). 20 Vernon boys, and 34 “naval
volunteers.” Wnen starting at I fiO p.m., “Captain”
Symons appears to have forgotten to ask the
engineer whether he was ready with his en.
gines, and that offi er not being so ready, the
noble vessel began to valiantly drift towards
the shore, and ahowvd a decided inclination to
■ Northampton " herself. The engineer passed the
word along that the injection valve was choked with
blnbbsr fish (()—or, as dear old Hunter street says,
with k nbbar ” ('!) —ao the port anchor wa* dropped
in order to keen her in deep water. Too much cable
being paid oat, the giddy vessel began to slew, and the
starboard anchor aTo hod to be dropped before she
oonld be brought to. By this time, pearly the whole
of the naval corps had learnt which was their left and
which their right hand, and could discourse learnedly
upon the respective merits of “larboard” and “star-
board." One daring spirit was even beard to bum
“ Larboard _ watch, akoy!” The branch of learning
which knocked most of them, however, was—chewing.
Bat, to proceed. Aid oime from H.M8. Diamond,
and those rascally blabber fish having been
despatched, the anchors were weighed, and
the stately vessel glode out towards the Heads
under her own head of steam It was calculated
that had uot tho Diamond rescue party arrived, it
would have taken the Naval Corps under Captain
Symons just 36 hours to produce the same results.
Under steam till dark, when sail was made. Now came
the glories of a life on the ocean wave. One qcarter,
master was told off to hunt after the Vsrnon b- js, who
were skulking like rats in holes and corners. Six of
the “standing crew” were ordered below for mesa and
lower deck duties, and the brant of the toil and glory
tberafon fell oa the naval corp , which started at this
critical pet iod to look yellow and green, and commenced
to tigh np its last meal. The corpa inol • ded only one
sail >r. The sails were set in a manner tl at would have
delighted the heart: of a land-lubbar—spanker first, then
main-topsail, fore-top tail, and lastly fore-topmast-staj-
sail, A man at the wheel was hoard to observe that he
couldn’t make out why tho ship steered so queerly,
coming to and fading off at its own sweet will; and it
was afterwards discovered that the rudder-head was
gone Whde the bo’sun was rigging up an outrigger
substitute, Lieut. Taylor employed the corps in lugging
away at ropes just for fun, and in order to give them a
solid notion ot the dangers of the seas. As an instruo
tion trip, the voyage was a perfect frost. Tho corps
worked with spirit, kut a?, blindly as immigrants ou a
voy ags out in times of emergency. A rope was put into
their hands, and they were told to lay back on it. Even
the piping to grog was an abortion—tho men each
receiving a glass of ’ Leer t then the squadron funked
on the weather, wnich, as the Herald poetically says,
“ began to look very bad indeed.” The “ gale of wind ”
in reality was a “fresh breeze,” and the “ heavy sea ” a
“ moderate swell.” Tho only astonishing incident ot
the voyage was that “Capt ” Symons shook hands
publicly with Messrs Fenwick and Cavill, the petty
officers of the watches.

capitally done; and, though the musicians are not yet

Sixteen Chinese travelling between Granite
Creek and Cairns (Q ) were attacked by blacks. Seven
of their number were killed, and their bodies taken off
by the niggers. North Queensland blacks are very fond
of Chinamen—that’s to say they consider them good
eating. The Mongolian doesn’t use so much salt as the
white, and his mode of living gives him a much better
flavour than that possessed by his white brother. When
hunting Ghinkies, for whose valour they have tho utmost
contempt, tho Myalls usually make a sudden rush, grab
their victims bv their pigtails, drag them off the track,
and nullah-nullah them. Latest advices say that this
cooking yarn is all a lie.
Fuller’s for Christmas Cards. —A splendid
collection of Christmas cards is now on view at Fuller’s
in George street—perhaps the finest yet seen in any city
in Australia. Judging by this display it would seem
that in Pans, Berlin, London, and New York special
effort has been made to develop the art of producing
these souvenirs The result ia that the pattern is alto-
gether improved, and we have now a description of
card that is wall worth pres-’nting and preserving.
Mr. Fuller’s collection, the last line of which arrived
only a few days ago, embraces the richest and most
attractive productions from Great Britain, the Continent
and America. These comprise richly-designed hind-
paiuted ivory and gelatine specimens, in a thousand
varieties; hamd-paiated satin, to fold, containing four
and six views ; hand-painted photos of flowers and
scenery; humorous illuminated and artistically-coloured
prints; photos of Australian flowers, hand-painted;
and real English and Australian fl >ra, artistically ar-
ranged in pamds— all ia some way rendered appropriate
by means of design or vor-e Tbs display altogether is
unique, and is valued at £5000, A large hall is specially
set apart for the collectiop, and the average daily attend,
anca of the public is about 2000. This is the fourth i ear
that Mr. Fuller has gone extensively into the Christ-
mas and New Year card business, and results ineio y
way justify his liberal expenditure in that direction.

.Though all Jewesses are not exactly handsome,
a distmot tjpe of beauty has been banded down among
the race for countless generation?, and a quaint legend
is thus told by an old writer of how the Hebrew women
have preserved their beanty " When ye Chrietus was
driven to Golgotha, ye men of Judea Him execrated,
wounded, and derided, but ye women, oh ye wcmen
bowed their beautiful heads and veiled their eyes in
their raven hair, and wept salt tears of grief to see ye
iamb so tortured and slain 5 and ye Christas decreed
t “ at “ enc 0 f °rth, yea and forever, ye eves that wept
B £° 1 retain their beau tie, ye foreheads that bowed
should shine as ye moon, and ye hair that was wet with
ye dew of pity should grow thick and lustrous on je
heads of their children and their children's children to
ye last generation.'*
The Prince of Wales has—either found or
created- another so-called benntr Everybody is now
tn king of his attentions to Miss Cbamberlaine, who,
thanks to his notice more than anything else, is daily
growing to be looked npon as a beauty. Strictly speak-
mg’, she cannot be called one. She has a pretty face,
a clear complexion, fluffy, silky, blonde hair, and that’s
all. Figure she has positively none, her shoulders
being high, her cbestnarrow, and her carriage awkward.
According to English taste, a woman simply can't be a
beanty unless she has a good figure. Her voice, too, is
deep and masculine in its tones, and her foot is by no
meins up to the American stuidard of smallness, as
exhibited to European eyes by the hundreds of American
girls who throng the Continent every summer.’* The
Fnnce invites her to his lawn-tennis party every after-
noon, and, of course, his “set** make much of her.
Her papa is supposed to be immensely rich.
Among the novelties of American shows lately
was an “ Author’s Carnival,” of which the feature was
the tableaux given every afternoon and evening by the
ladies of the booths. Some idea of these interesting
spectacles may be gained when wo mention that scenes
were given from Longfellow’s Miles Standish, Evange-
line, &c, from Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand
Leagues under the Sea, from Chancer and Shake-
speare's works, from Hugo’s Notre Dame, from Luorezia
Borgia, Dumas's Joseph Balsamo, and many others.
Tableaux were made from Dord s pictures, and from
the poems of Rossetti (the Blessed Damozol), Morris
(Atalanta picking np the apple), and from Millais
Venus rising from the Sea was the sensation ; a lady of
matchless beauty being prevailed upon to exhibit
as Aphrodite. Swinburne was hesitated over for a
time, and a select committee of matrons debated long
and anxiously over the fleshly Algernon’s works and
though they unanimously voted his Villon a shameless
creature, the “Repentance of Talvasiua” (really
almost a religious sound I) and one cr two minor poems
were represented. Altogether, the entertainment
afforded a dresm of pleasant memories for many a day
to those who witnessed it.
Thirty appointments in the Telegraph Depart-
ment, salary commencing at ten shillings per week, were
lately thrown open to public competition amongst the
women of Victoria. There were no fewer than eight
hundred entries for this extraordinarily rich stake. The
Argus containing the announcement had also a closely
printed column and a half of advertisements—“Domes-
tic servants wanted.” So that want of an opening for
female employment cannot bo the cause of this charge
of tbe eiebt hundred. Female vanity is the motive
power. Biddy O’Hooligan would rather slave in a
coffee palace—Heaven only knows how many hours a
week—for fifteen shillings, than occupy a comfortable
place in tbe house of a private family who pay her just
as well for less work, and give h<r board and
lodging. At the coffeo palaoe she wears a smart
dres« and rap. and U known to the boys ss

is called Bridget, and if ever her employer, old
Jones, catches young Jones kissing the splay-footed

t > say they’re brb flass barristers, or commission agents,
bi'liard markers; and onr daughters are ladks ie

We have to announce the receipt of the London
Illustrated News of 2ft ,h October, with a sepia per
tr‘it of Princess Emineh, witoof the Khedive a lady
of commanding presence and a Maritana get-up. The
Khedive has only one wife, but is otherwise Solomou-
ish. He cannot however, increase his harem without
tbe consent of the Prinorss Emineh; and there’s a row
whan she considers the Khedive is Towflk with any of
her f’onrt ladies. 'I hey live in separate palaces, and
tie Viceroy contents himself with being connubially
blissful by telephone. The Princess is very stout • and
ai she has chiefly gleaned her notions on men and
things from the illustrated papers and the novels of
Ponson du Terrail, her ideas on general topics are a bit
mixed 8ha is a great admirer of Queen Victoria,
having first seen a portrait of that domesticated old
lidp on the lid of a soap-box. Photos, have been
since lent to the Princess by Her Majesty, but Tewfik
fearing the effects of sudden and awful disillusion, bag
always taken care tfcey should miscarry, and laid the
blame of their noc-amval on the •' well-connected ”
young men in the Post Office. This is pretty well all
we the Prince**, as she didn't send us a
confidential note with the piotnre. We can anthorita-
tively Soate, however, that she doesn’t smoko She
may play skittles, though, for aught can say to th~
contrary, though h.-.r weight adapt’ her more to the
aristocratic and enthralling game of Murrumhidgoo. or
the refined and patrician pastime of Tambaroora.

Mather was a young and talented physician, who won
not only a beautiful but a wealthy wife. As his practice
increased atd reputation spread. Dr. Mather was fre-

save her annoyance He was always waked noiselessly,
no bells were heard, he hsd telephones erected so as to
consult at long di tanocs; bat all in vain. The lady
insisted on fcis giving up his night practice, arsing
that the loss of income was immaterial, as her wealth
compensate!. He was an enthusiast in his profession,
and firmly refnsed to give in ; so a case was mutvall;'
submitted to the court. The Judge gave the wife her

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The dates fixed for the A.J.C. Autumn meeting
are 26th, 28th, 30th, and 31st March next.
The New South Wales cricketers were accorded,
on Saturday, a formal reception at the Oriental Hotel,
by the Victorian Cricket Association.
George Montgomery, the veteran open-boat
sailor and skipper of the Lottie and Carlotta, died at
his residence. North Shore, on the 14th instant.
Rush and Laycock’s match has been finally
settled to come off on the 10th March. There will also
be a handicap prize of £50 for an all-comers’ outrigger
race.
Carmelite, who had been first favourite for the
gammer Cup, was scratched for that event on Satur-
day morning. It is reported that the stable have mere
confidence in another horse.
The other day, W. P. Phillips, the English
amateur 100 yards champion, beat H. E. Ball in a 440
yards’ race, by a foot. The time was splendid— 50
1-5 see.
Palmer, the Victorian bowler, has so far re-
covered that it is expected he will play in the Inter-
colonial match on Saturday. He took a preliminary
anter on Wednesday with the Albert Park Cinb.
An exchange observes that an Ivo Blight has
come over our cricketers. Great Evans! What’s this
journal Giffen in this fiendish Slight ? [Mem,: This
item is believed to have originated in the Crown Law
Offices.— Ed. Bi]
The Grafton Rowing Club’s inaugural regatta
on Saturday afternoon was a great success. Following
are the resultsMeillon Trophy, two-pair sculls,
J. E. Donaldson and E. J. Tierney, 1. Cohen Trophy,
pair sculls, J. E. Donaldson 1, E. Donaldson 2.
The next engagement of the English Eleven
will he at Ballarat on Boxinr Day and the following
days. Then they return to Melbourne for the great
match with the Australian Eleven, commencing on
New Year’s Day.
Tho annual meeting of the N.S.W. Rowing Asso-
ciation was held on Monday evening. The eleution of
officers was carried out, the Hon. George Thornton
being re-elected President. The trophies and medals
were presented to the winning crews and members.
The Intercolonial Match is to be played on the
Melbourne Club’s ground, the Club to receive 25 per
cent, of the gross takings of the grandstand. Three
prizes are to be given, of the value of £5 5s. each, for
the best individual play on either side in the match,
namely, for the best bowling average of not less than
80 balls, for the highest score ia the match, and for the
best fielding.
While the English Eleven went north from New-
castle, the Hon. Ivo Bligh returned to Sydney, and was
practising daily on the Association Ground. He evi-
dently intends to get himself into form for the coming
match with the Australian Eleven. He is a fine bats-
man, stands up well at the wickets, and hits hard,
though at present the strokes seem slightly uppish.
Bates, the cricketer, intends to settle in Sydney
when hia engagement with the English Eleven is fnl-
filled It is suggested, in view of his determination,
that he should be selected to play for N.S. Wales in
tho Intercolonial match. This would be questionable
taste, and, though bis services would be invaluable,
we’d rather see N.S. Wa'es play without him. A vic-
tory with him would make Victoria howl.
The Victorian Cricket Association are desirous
that the Intercolonial match should be commenced on
the 23 rd (Saturday) instead of Tuesday, so that the
match can be played out. The only objection is that
two clear days will intervene between the first and
second days, and one of these days is Sunday; conse-
quently, according to the canons of betting, all wagers
made before the change of date will be off.
During a boat-race at Newcastle, on the 14th,
Mr. Clarence H. Hannell’s yacht Oomoobah, while off
Scott’s Point, came to grief through the mast snap-
ping. Mr. Hannell was pitched overboard, but was
quickly rescued. The race was between the Oomoobah,
Captain Williams’ Waani, and a craft from the Ameri-
can barque John Worn ter. The Oomoobah was winning
at the time of the aec'dent. The race was then won by
tho Wanui. The stakes were a champagne supper at
the Great Northern H .tel.
The N.S.W. Cri ket Association have agreed
to the proposal from Victoria, that the Intercolonial
Match he commenced b Saturday, provided that before
the match arrangements be made for the rolling,
watering, and mowing of the wickets; and if thought
necessary by the captain of the N.S.W. Eleven, a
fre>.h wicket be prepared for the second day, whether
an innings be completed or not. In order to widen the
flold (or selection. A, Geary was dispatched to Mel-
bourne.
The Association assembled on Monday evening
te deliberate on Mr. P. Ironside’s prenosal, that a
match bo arranged between tho English Eleven and 21
Juniors with a coach, and they calmly proceeded to sit
heavily down upon it. It was alleged that a bettor 22
could be selected from the members of the junior
Association Clubs. There was a strong disinclination,
should the match be arranged to entrust the selection of
a team to Mr. Ironside. IftheMelbourneC.C representa-
tive is desirous of the proposed match, the Association
have expressed their willingness to relieve Mr. Ironside
of this arduous and responsible duty.
Although the rain prevented the English Eleven
from exhibiting their prowess in the cricket field at
Tamworth, they had an opportunity of playing a good
knife and fork at the banquet given in their honour, at
which the Mayor (Mr. N. Cohen) presided The Tam-
worth people are very much disappointed, and strenuous
exertions are to be made to induce the Eleven to pay
them another visit, when it is to be hoped Jupiter
Pluvius will be more propitious. The Englishmen
improved the dullness of the occasion by some kangaroo
hunting, which they found more congenial than leather
hunting—though, by the bye, they have had none of the
latter yet in Australia.
The Cook Park bowling green was reopened last
week. Great improvements have been effected during
the month that the ground has been closed. It is now
a “thing of beauty and a joy for ever." The green
itself is picturesque, and looks like a spot clipped from
fairyland, but when it is studded with the 18-stone
votaries of the game, the illusion is rather incomplete.
Tradition assigns many shapes and forms to the fairies,
but we have not yet read of elves without wings and
with protuberant “ binjies.”
The Hawkesbury Amateur Turf Club’s meeting
was very uninteresting. The attendance was poor, and
the racing and arrangements were bad Umbula, a
flve-year-old Vat tendon gelding, won the Flying Handi-
cap. The Novel Selling Race was an easy win for
Highlander. In the Windsor and Richmond Handicap,
Rupert retrieved his laurels and won easily. The
Farmer’s Purse was carried off by West Country Dick,
and Malta won the Consolation Stakes. JD. Nicholson
rode the winners of the Flying Handicap and the Con-
solation Stakes.
At a meeting, on the 15th instant, of the newly-
formed Liverpool Jockey Clnb, it was decided to hold
the first race meeting on 17th March next. There are
to be five races, with £200 added money ; Liverpool
Handicap of £100, 11 mile; Flying Handicap of £40,
i mile; Selling Race of £3 J, 1 mile ; Woodlands’ Han-
dicap of £25,7 furlongs; and Farewell Handicap of £15,
1 mile. The club has leased part of the Woodlands
Estate, for five years, and are at work improving it.
Messrs Soarr and Gannon are to be bandioapper and
starter respectively.
W. G. George, the English amateur champion
runner, is in New York, where he will run Myers, the
American champion, a series of races at half, three,
quarters, mile, and mile and a half. George’s records
for each mile, from one (4:19 2-5) to ten (52:561), ara all
bests on record, as is also his three-quarter mile record,
3:8 2 5. Myers has the reeord for all the short dis-
tances^—half mile 1:55 3-5 11000 yards 2:18. George is
about 24 years old, stands 5tt. Him. and weighs, in con-
dition, about 147 lb.
The race for maiden fours in outrigger gigs by
members of the Glebe Rowing Club for the prize pre-
sented by the president, Sir G. W. Allen, came off on
the 14th, and resulted as follows : —Snowball —I Bar-
nett, R. Sanders, M. Mitchell, J. Harper—1. Li Mas.
cotte —P. Williams, W. St. Clair, F. Maoready, P.
Ickorson—2. Both crews rowed well together as far as
Jarrett’s Point; the Snowball then forged ahead, and
eventually won by three-quarters of a length.
A successful meeting was held on the 14th for
the purpose of forming a rowing club for Woolloo-
mooloo Bay. Mr, Frank M'Donald was elected seere-
tary pro tem,, and about thirty names were enrolled
for membership. Thera is to be a second meeting to.
night (Thursday), at Punch's (late Dimonda’) Hotel,
and fully 100 names are expected for enrolment. We
see no reason why the movement should not be success-
ful ; the want of a rowing club ia the Bay has long
been felt.
The race for .£100 aside, in light skiffs, over the
champion coarse, Parramatta River, between the
brothers Jenkins and Messrs. Campbell and Jndge. of
the H outer River, was woe. easily by the former. The
Northern men were the favourites; but the brothers
Jenkins went ahead soon after starting, and, increasing
their lead, they eventually won by about eight lengths.
The Prince of Wales and Ethel steamers followed the
race, but the former got on the flats off Kissing Point,
and the passengers saw no more of the race.
The match for the Furness Junior Cup, between
the Australian and Alexandria Clubs, resulted in a
victory for the former by 54 runs. At the end of the
first day’s play the Alexandria players had to get 63
runs to win, but, through the excellent bowling ©f
’ Smedley and Chapman, and their own bad batting, they
succeeded in compiling only 8 runs, two of which were

As a result of negociations with the secretary of
the Associated Warehousemen’s Cricaet Club of Mel-
bourne, a match has been arranged between teams of
warehousemen from the two colonies. The New South
Wales men, including emergencies, are Cleeve, Searle,
Gosnell, Vallack, Woods, Goldsmith, Keene, Chapman,
O’Connell, Alderson, Upton, Colbron, and Corderoy.
They leave here by train on the 29th, and the match
oommencss at Melbourne on the 6th January. In each
case the players have been gathered from as many houses
as possible, and the Melbourne men have made liberal
arrangements as regards the ex’s of our representatives.
They may find them not snch very “soft goods ” on the
ground; and, if all goes well, it is hoped to make the
affair annual.

“ The Daily News, referring to the victories
recently gained by the Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team in Aus-
tralia, rejoices that at last the pride of colonial
cricketers is being humbled."—Cablegram.
“ Whoop,” says the News ; ” how Ivo's team
Have Austral wiekets tumbled I
Just ain't we glad, just don't we scream.
To see their priae so humbled I
How all their boys, from ‘ demon' Sp®ff.
To bland and bonny Bonner,
Put jam on when our bails flew off—
Now, we’ve retrieved our honour."
Since thus the Daily News man belched,
Onr cricketers havefelt quite squelched.
The moral is: All winners butter,
But kick a man who’s in the gutter.
The Snail’s Bay Amateur Regatta was most
successful. Five started for the race for half-decked
boats, which was won by H. Doran’s Ethel. Six com-
peted in the race of 24-feet open boats under canvas,
the winner being' M. A. H. Fitzhardinge’s Alelphi.
The junior fours in clinker outriggers, was won by the
Oracle. T. W. Spain’s Happy Thought was the first of
the open boats between twenty and twenty-threo feet
long. The race for skiffs under caLvas was a win for J.
Elliott’s Pandora. The Dreadnought, J. Milham and
E Watson—was the winner of the donblo scull race
for residents of Balmain, in watermen’s boats. The
Begins—W. E. Ainsworth—won the race for 16-feet
dingies under canvas. During this race the Victory
upset; one of her crew got on board the Begins, and
climbed her mast, evidently with a view to capsize her
also. The Begina crew pulled him down and threw
him back into the witer from which he was soon
rescued. Five competed for tho maiden single sculls
in club skiffs, which was won by the Eva —3. H. Martin.
The race for 14-feet dingies, under canvas, was won by
E. Walter’s Carrie; that for 14 feet canvas dingies, b>
A. Spencer’s Olivette A Sydney Bowing Club crew
won the maiden string-test gig race, and P. Ives and
T. H. Martin the junior double sculls. The gig and
dingy race was cleverly won by the dingy, G. Hayes.
The prizes were afterwards presented to the winners.
On the first day of the Australian Eleven's
match against Fifteen of South Australia, the game
was slower than any game played on the Adelaide Oval
for years. The Fifteen, short of their most confident
man, Noel, and otherwise disabled, batted during the
first innings with a consistent weakness which made all
spectators grind their teeth. Everything, though, has
an exception, the exception in this case being Jarvis,
who played fine cricket. The Eleven gave their old
comrade a special welcome, and even condescended
to greet him by the whilom familiar name of “ Beef."
Except when M’Donnell fell to slogging, the innings of
the Eleven was dreadfully monotonous. Giffen, as
perhaps might be expected, batted excellently, but
there were some curious decisions which materially
altered the aspect of the scores. Prominent among
these was an early veto which gave Murdoch not out
soon after his innings began, when caught by the
wicket-keeper. It is understood that he quite believed
himself ont, and was retiring amid the frantic applause
of South Australians, when called back by tke umpire.
It seamed too good that Qnilty should clean bowl
Massie and have Murdoch caught at the wicket in the
same over. Yet this is what may have happened.
Bannerman was also missed off Quilty long before Jesse
Hide bowled him, and the fielding of the Fifteen was
something to he for ever avoided by people who wish
to rank as cricketers. Jarvis shone in the local second
innings, too, and, although Murdoch had been in good
form, showed batting no whit inferior to anything done
throughout the game, Spofforth bowled well at first,
but was a comparative failure afterwards. Each side -
suffered from the umpiring, but South Anstralia to i
the greatest extent. A double moral may fairly enough
be deduced from this the first game of the “ All Vic-
torious" on their native soil. First, it is simple
nonsense for South Australia to continue her present
system of playing odds against the best Elevens
Second, it will be a most dangerous proceeding for the
Australian Eleven to meet the Hon. Ivo Blign’s team
without Palmer and Garrett. Wo admit that on
Spotforth’s day out it seems hardly necessary to have
even a second bowler. But then it is not always
Spofforth’s day out, and he is becoming more and more
a " Sunday man."

The memorable match in Chichester, where the
United Eleven, or, more correctly speaking, the United
ten of England, sustained so severe a drab Wag at the
hands of the Australians, was the occasion oi a suit
brought against Mr Gilbert, the promoter of the match,
by a local professional who was pressed into service.
Gilbert offered to pay the plaintiff £5 tor his services,
but this was refused. The plaintiff based his claim on
the assertion that professionals playing against the
Australians were always paid a higher toe than in ordi-
nary matches. He produced a letter from the defendant,
written to theloeal promoters of the match, is which it
was explained that £120 was required to bring d»* sieves*
down, because the men would not play for the
money as in an ordinary matoh. Plaintiff admitted h#
cross-examination that he had received only £6 when
playing for Sussex against the Australian Eleven of
1880. A suggestion was made by the plaintiff's solicitor
that the case should be referred to the Marylebone Club,
defendant paying costs. This was declined, and no evi-
dence was called for the defence. The judge, while
regretting the absence of satisfactory evidence a* to the
ordinary fee to bo paid to professional cricketers,
gave a verdict for the plaintiff for £6, being
the same amount as ha received when playing
for his own county against an Australian Eleven
H. Fowler, of Somersetshire —one of the hardest hitters

the time when Rowell bagged his 10,000 dollars, and
bought a farm with hia pile. Judging from the tone of
the American sporting papers, there are not likely to be
any more trials of endurance tor many a long day, and
the pedestrians will have to look np some other
athletic novelty to catch the pnblio’s patronage

The Canadians have invented a very entertaining game
at cards, which is now much patronised on the ocean
steamers. It is called Quatre Valets. The cards are
dealt out to the players, of whom there may be any
number playing by leaving out cards enongh to make
the deal come out even. There are ten deals, and the
object of each player is to avoid taking a knave, whieh
counts as follows; dabs, 4; spades, 3 j hearts, 2;
diamonds, 1. The best hand is a low band, which can-
not take a trick. Players follow suit, the highest card
takes, and each player tries to get rid of any knave he
may have in his hand by throwing it or any high card
away when unable to follow suit. After playing ten
hands the number of knaves taken by each player is
summed np, and the person taking the lowest number
wins tno game. It is a favourite game at the hotels of
the Canadian watering places The great six-day go-

Last Saturday, Lady Loftus held a reception at
Government House, wuon about two hundred presen-
tations were made, mere than three-fourths of the
number being ladies, whose dresses made the recaption

families were represented, and His Excellency and the
usual routine of household officials were in attendance.
All was over before six o’clock,

Tho world at large will be glad to learn that
Mr. John Kales, junior, has attained the age of 21.
This interesting and important fact was a source of tho
deepest gratification to his respected and affluent
parents, and they, that is to say tno Hon. John and Mrs.
Kales, therefore, gave a grand call at “ Duckenlieid ’’ on
Wednesday, 13th instant, to celeorate tho occasion.
Pu'ly 150 guests were present, ladies and gentlemen
equally divided, and everything was done in a stylo
ti.at spared neither money nor trouble to achieve a
thorough success. Of course, the long journey rendered
it impossible for some of the invited ones io accept,
nevertholefs, many travelled weary miles over laud and
sea to the splendid Duckenttald mansion to grace the
ballroom. It was decorated as befitted the occasion,
with evergreens, flowers, wreathed garlands, and many
devices, and a tall wind-and-string band furnished
music tor the gliding feet of the dancers. Programmes
were white and gold, bourn g the event and data only,
and contained dances enough to last till the
dawn next day. Mrs. Eale-i, the hi stess, wore
a rich peach blossom satin, with suitable trimming,
and an unmarried sister was arrayed in cream nun’s
olotb, slashed with crimson satin, which looked charm-
ingly pretty. A dark young lady from Potts Point dis-
played her handsome figure in cream i atin and lace; a
married lady from Dunmore was very handsome in
white satin broohe and crimson; and a married niece
of the hostess, from the Fatei a m, was one of the most
elegantly attired of the fair guests. Opinions as to
belie varied, and it would be difficult —perhaps unfair—
to indicate ouespecia ly. But several well-known ladies
received os much admiration as any reasonable belle
oould expect. Some admirers would have placed the
honour of pre-eminenoe between two sisters from
Duninald," others would have it rest on an exceed,
ingly pretty as well as amiable girl (since e/i route far
Brisbane) in navy silk and Spanish lace; or on ‘-nice
nineteen ’ from “ Dingloy Dell,” in pale blue nun’s
cloth, cream satin ana wroutti—a divine dancer, and
as sanoy as no mutter." Then, the wife of a ga lUnt
naval captain was also impiessive in cream satin and
diamonds bright, and many others were worthy of fuller
mention; but, though it may break our hearts to
leave them out, we can’t possibly stretch the paper any
more this week. Truth (and it must be that, or no-
bbing, with us, dear readc<) compels us to say that some
of tho Sydney fair did not appear to their best ad-
vantage —the trip up the previous night having taken
tho ‘ go” out of them. The City Catering Co. sup-
plied ; and wo must not forget that there was plenty of
enjoyment in the courtyard, oonservaloriep, push
Louses, hot-houses, verandahs, and billiard-room for
those who wanted variety. And the lawns and gardens
heard the same old story as the night passed on.

Tuesday was an “ open ” night with the Peter-
sham Owls, and they entertained 200 friends at the
local Town Hall. First part of programme was
musical; a selection from “Miritana” bv a young lady
was especially good, and so was “ A Dream within a
Dream.” »\n owl sang ‘‘The Death of Nelson ’ well;
and Mies Whoames, who did most of the accompanying,
played a Fantasia brilliantly. As Tima’s scythi oat the
programme short, some of the combined instrumental

po good at the last entertainment lost a chance. A
recitation from Pickwick was a success, and another
from Hamlet, wasn't. Dancing began about 10 30,
Ilwalatfom and Bamsay playing, none too well. Among
tho dresses, bine bloomed most plentifully; and among
the faces, n one was prettier than that of a maiden fair
with golden hair, frptn Eedf.rn, in light green sateen
skirt, and low-necked black satin short sleeved bodice,
trimmed with lace. A married lady, blonde, wore
pretty black silk and meirc f touched off with pink.
lavender silk was rich. The daughter of a Surry
Hills aldesjpiH (great on fancy birds) were a hand-
some prune satin with cream lace ; and the daughter of
gL rejected patriot wore a cream and Hue sitin, which
put her nearer the top of the poll than her pa was. A
stately and haedsome young kdy of Sbinmore wore a
dress <jt light texture and cardinal hows; and some
Petersham sisters, their bridesmaids’ bines. A large
number of visitors wept from Sydney, and returned
pleased per PITS trai&. Mr. Adams, secretary, was
quite—ahem!—efficacious in bis jpsrjagcment. We'll
always go.

A pretty Goulburn girl, named Esther Mitohell,
Aged 28. sued Frank Fr>er, as engine-driver, aged 30,
PD Friday, for breach of promise. Frank said he didn’t
promt*#, and that, even if he did, the promise had been
annulled by mutual agreement. The cose was a typical
one. Here'., the last letter written by him to her
*• VVagga, Thursday. My dear Essie, Keceivtd jour
last letter. I potpd pot write sooner. I scarcely know
what to say now. I att yflu to forgive mo writing snoh
nasty letters as tho last wepe I was mid. I’ve been
so awfully put about for the ?asp three or four months
—the greatest wonder is I am hsce toVjdte this. You
must h ive noticed my strange conduct on my Jast visit
to Goulburn. The day before I came down 1 got a letter
to say that all the money I had worked so hard for and
pinched myself for was gone. I never told yon how 1
Dad been speculating in mining. I thought to give you
puch a- (surprise. and instead I lost it ail but three or
jfoar popsda. That was partly the causa of my lorg
delay ip speaking to your mother. Would to goodness
I had tohi you the real state of affairs at first. Oh,
Essie, I am broteu..hcart0d. I have done wrong in
another way I cannot flpd ip my heart to leave her now
in trouble. I have driven everyth jng to the last minute.
I tell yon, Essie, I am more to bo pitied ' ban blamed now.
X know you will be sorry fer me when I toll you we have
Dad two fights, ’cause I won’t take your gem out of my
locket. I shall stick to it, Essie, as long as I dare, and
that is to be next Tuesday. Then, a"d not till then,
will I shift it. I don't know what on earth I am to do
when the affair is over. I shall not have sixpence to
bless myself with. I expect we’ll have to go into
lodgings. I can’t leave her at home. This is the
fourth time I've tried to write this letter. Essie, I
must appeal to your generosity not to cause me any
trouble—I know you would not do it of yourself I
expect there woald be nothing else for me only going
to prison, and yon, I know, would not like to see me
rained, bad as I have been. Please, Essie, now, do try, •
and forgot and forgive yonr broken-hearted Prank. I
have all your letters carefully put together. No one
has ever seen one or ever will, except yonr self, Essie,
do forgive me, and only for my sake, if over you loved
me, keep our secret.” She then obtained the return of
her tokens and letters. A certificate of defendant’s
marriage with another was produced at the trial. The
jury awarded plaintiff £300.

On Wednesday a most interesting display took
place in the Girls’ Department of the Crown-street
Public school, it was quite an impromptu idea on the
part of Miss Smith, tho head teacher, and the work
shown had been dene without any idea of exhibition.
In any case, however, it could scarcely have been
dona belter. In the afternooe, there was singing and
pausio in the large class room, which was densely
packed with visitors. A little mite of seven, Katie
jCirle, sang “Little Footsteps” as if she had been
accustomed to public appea ranees all her short life,
a»d very sweetly. Presentations weie made : to Miss
Smith were given an epergne and pair of flowerstands,
with an address ilium Hated by a pupil, Mus Claudie
Hull, and to Miss Tocher, assistant, a centre-piece.
The books of ordinary school woik were extremely
peat, those of Florence Bee by and Beatrice Buchanan
especially. The latter young lady and Claudie Hull
were excellent in drawing. The drawings and illumi-
pations by the pupils of ijrs. O’Byrne, were, indeed,
the feature (to gentjemen) of tie «hcy. cnl gave proof
cot only of ability In the pupils, but of most efficient
training by their o’eyer instructors. Ladies, theugh
were lavish in praise of tho needlework, which was
excellent, Mrs. Beliridgo being the jjacher. It
Is only quite lately that Lscy n-edievuik has teen
introduced, and the emlroidtry, orewe', mucrsjne, and
wool work was faultlessly mat. The room was n oely
decorated, thronged with visitors, the girls were
d flighted to see their handiwoi k noticed, and it will be
all visible to-day (Thursday), from 10 to 5, and is
worth a long walk to lock at. We haven’t time to say
any more just now.

At Armidala, while people were waiting to hear
the result of the election, a man left the crowd, went
d «wn on his knees in the middle of the street clasped
his hands, looked in what is popularly supposed to be
the direction of Heaven, and asked the Almighty to pat
O’Connell at the top of the poll. No one prayed for
Proctor, but someone threw a rotten egg at him. He
went up top, neverthelegg.

In a certain town out West the Returning Officer,

Since Tom O’Mara got in the second time, he
has bloomed forth into a howling swell. Nothing less
now than the lightest of suits, an Ascot hat, and
several yards of cigar. Now, when a certain distin-

has to approach O’M., M P , with hamility. Bather
different to the time when lorn used to write scathers
at tariff price, and in the intervals of labour toss an-
other barrister journalist for pifoi of tobacco. This is
Tumnt-ch ! But we’re all Bohemians.
Monday’s Telegraph delivers itself of the fol-
lowing :—“ Mr. J. Garrard, returned at the head of the
poll for Balmain, sat in last Parliament, and on all
main issues, until the division on the Land Bill, was
with the Government. On that division he went wPh
ths Opposition, bat by no means accepted Mr. Stuait'p
formularies, and his election speeches since, have since
shown him to bs in the same mind. He will continue
his parliamentary career as a Government sympathiser,
except so far as regards the land question.’' This has
all the semblance of an Inspired paragraph, yet every-
body knows that Garrard voted with the Government
in the division on the Land Bill. If we cannot bs
respectable, let os, at least, be correct.
Sir Patrick Jennings would undoubtedly have
gone in for tue Bogan unopposed, had it not oeen for
the underhand tactics of the Dub bo Vaughanites. This
party iu its desire to make bir Patrick feel under an
obligation to “the Church” for the seat, stirred up
the other side of religious sentiment, and the result is,
so far, a pot of money out of Pat’s pocket, and it might
easily have involved a loss to the colony of one of its most
able, eloquent, and honest public men. Batter for him
had ho been “ denounced from the alhar,” like Dillon
and Ueydou.
Mr. E. Rudder (who was beaten by a glove-
poisoned Unpid), is good enough to scud us, for punli-

considerably taller than the Bathursc-street column.

been a real pleasure to us to publish for the delectation
of our readers, the adlressos of defeated candidates for
country oonstituencei. We consider that we em-
barked in newspaper enterprise expressly for this.
Mr. Budder also states that he wilt forward us (also
for publication), his address to the free and independent
at the declaration of the poll, " as soon as he can get
it.” More joy! We think, therefore, we will wait for
this before publishing the other. If there is a hot wind
blowing, Mr. Budder needn’t hurry,

The Morning Rum (or the Weekly Shroud—

Writes a correspondent The appointments of
Batarning-Offioers made by Government era simply a
disgrace to the colony. Out West, a Butarning othcer
was not sober a single hour for two days lefore the
nomination, or, for some time after the polling. In £ ict,
while declaring the poll, he had to hold on to the rail-
ing of the huntings. The same officer has been openly
charged with so far favonr.ng one seotiin of the voters
as to appoint, excepting in one instance, members of a
certain political a-sociation, and the avowed supporters
of one of tbe candidates, as Deputy Beturuing-ofiicer
and poll clerks. Some of these niHcira were actually
saea after their appointment to pull down the bills of
the candidates to whom they were politically opposed,
and otheis mii gled in the crowd and uooted the candi-
dates to whom they were opposed. The Betnmlng-
officer at the nomination allowed, before taking the show
of hands, a supporter of one of the candidates to
harangue the electors, although tbe sai>.e candidate
bad teen duly proposed and seconded; and as a con-
clusion to this ventuman’s (F) antics, he is now trotting
about the slr.ets with shirt and trousers only on."
A large numbar of the supporters of the late
lamented mcmb-r for the Shoaihaven electorate, the
funereal Wos-.'by, are, in American phrase "mad," and
have resorted to the expedient of ‘boycotting" their
political oppmeats. Amongst those on whom they
wreak their spite is the editor of the Milton Times,
who, in reporting Woaeby s address, gen roi Iv bed
hack certain twaddle in the form of weak.kne d bmday
school stories with sickly mnrals attached and care-
fully abstained from publishing person il equina reflect-
ing in any way on Wosebj's private reputation. But
the editor committed the crime of supporting Mr.
Humphery, a gentleman possessing, to far as o.,n be
known of an untried man, many of the qualifications of
an able M P. The editor has been Master of tie local
Orange Lodge for six years, bat fcr the heinoui crime
of exercising bis political independence and refusing
to support a ministerial shuttlecock, forty “ brothers "
tave announced their intention of withdrawing iheir
support from his piper, and have threatened him with
expulsion fro n tne lodge. One snpp rter of the old
n.ember has withdrawn his regular advert's meat inm
the Times and has subs itnted one r fl >oaag on the
circulation of the paper. Orangtism m y be good
enough when it permits a man to te tie keeper of his
own conscience, but when it in till respect attempts to
exercise the rights claimed by the Church cf Rome. its
exponents only succeed in showing that a do id K n,
Billy may be just as dangerous a tyrant as a live Po. e.
