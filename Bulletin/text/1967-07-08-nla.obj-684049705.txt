Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
'63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the ’63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this year’s reasonable price
and in the light of possible
future shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying ’64
now, you gain some 20 to
30 cents a bottle each year.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been ’54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
A freedom struggle
in the south: in
with boots and all
IT HAS BEEN SAID that God wears
football boots in Melbourne. Yet this
season of 1967 something strange and
fearful has happened. Nothing seems
right any more. Indeed, it has been an
unusual winter full of weird phenomena
and incredible manifestations. There
have been great gas and oil discoveries
in Bass Strait, unseasonal cyclones, ter-
rible rains on the Queensland coast, yet
here in Melbourne it has been warm
and dry with long hours of sunshine.
Sunshine in June in Melbourne does
awful things to the temperament.
You see, your correspondent is grop-
ing for some solution to the terrible
thing that has happened. Melbourne
now has an Anti-Football League and
it is growing hourly to become a force
of some dimensions. This week Batman
put on his black cloak and flew round
to the office of the “Sun News Pictorial”
to find out 'the real truth about this
subversive organisation. Quickly he
came up with some answers. The presi-
dent of the AFL is Douglas Wilkie, a
Foreign Affairs commentator. The very
title explained a good deal. Furthermore,
he was born in England.
Wilkie was away, but your corres-
pondent, with much difficulty, gained
an interview with the secretary, Keith
Dunstan, a columnist. He was a typical
product of his time, unruckmanlike,
thin, shifty-eyed, with eyes too close
together.
Batman: Why have you formed an
Anti-Football League?
Dunstan: I shall read you a statement
by the president: “Australia’s faith in
democracy demanded it. The acid test
of any democracy is whether it allows
minorities to enjoy a fair slice of the
national cake. We anti-footballers are
a very considerable minority.”
Batman: Now stop giving us your
Maoist poems. How did it really start?
Dunstan: It happened on a Sunday.
| think it was after the fourth round.
Wilkie was at a very low ebb. You must
appreciate we get up to 23 hours of
football on television previews, in-
9uests, replays, post-mortems the
hours on radio add up to hundreds. But
Its the conversation that’s worse. You
daren’t enter any group unless you
know how many goals Wade has kicked,
whether Barassi went well . . . Wilkie
erupted. He said: “Oh, God, I can’t
stand it. There ought to be some
society to protect us from all this.” So
next morning, very timidly, very tenta-
tively at the bottom of the column, I
put in a few lines suggesting such an
organisation.
Batman: Yair?
Dunstan: Next morning there were
42 letters from people demanding to be
members.
Batman: Is that many?
Dunstan: Normally, only an attack
on the RSL, royalty, or a bishop brings
out that many. But when the letters kept
coming and coming we had no choice
but to go on. Then a curious thing
happened. A letter came from a gentle-
man on the letterhead of K. G. Luke
Pty. Ltd. saying why not have a badge?
He would design us one.
Batman: This is more unpleasant
than I feared. Is not Sir Kenneth Luke
our president of the Victorian Football
League?
Dunstan: Yes, but this chap was just
in the badge division and he designed
us something beautiful. It is so good
a fashion couturier in Collins Street,
Mrs. Rogers, of La Petite, has since
ordered a gross to put on her new
spring-summer collection. We wanted a
badge, small, red, a cube, symbolic of
an object that would not bounce.
Batman: Yes, this desire for a badge
is typical. Why did you want one?
Dunstan: The idea was that this
badge should be worn at all times. Then
when an AFL member recognised
another AFL member he knew that
here was hope, here was a chance for
an intelligent conversation, free of foot-
ball.
Batman: Then what?
Dunstan: Well, it took four weeks
to get the badges made. In that time
we couldn’t get anyone to sell them
and I had to buy the first 600 myself.
Retailers weren’t keen, even though we
made the whole thing in favor of the
Berry Street Babies’ Home. I trust you
will buy one at once. The price is 40
cents, or a dollar if you’d like to make
a handsome donation.
Batman: I . . . er . . . ah.
Dunstan: We put them on sale . . .
“I know! Let’s talk about the weather!”
through the mail . . . couldn’t do it any
other way . . . starting June 18 and the
whole 600 were gone by the afternoon
of June 19. We were overwhelmed. The
letters were coming in at the rate of
200 a day and we had no more badges.
Immediately we had to order another
5000. They’ve almost gone now and we
have put in another repeat order. Col-
lingwood membership is 8000, we plan
to be the biggest club in the League.
Batman: You’re getting rather a wild
look about the eyes. You haven’t men-
tioned the protest letters, have you?
Dunstan: Er . . . yes . . . there were
a lot of letters accusing us of being
Communists, a subversive activity, you
see. One said: “You’re a bloody Commo.
Typical of you lot, always against the
young people.” Another said: “If you
don’t like football, why don’t you get
out. LEAVE MELBOURNE NOW.”
Another said: “What a cheapskate out-
look. Making your badge red is very
indicative.” Another wrote: “Now that
you have got your League why don’t
you all get out of Victoria. There are
plenty of decent Victorians in Sydney
who are pining to get home for the
finals. We could work a sort of exchange
like between the Egyptians and the
Israelis. One decent Victorian in Syd-
ney for 1000 AFL members.”
Batman: Violence?
Dunstan: There have been a few
scuffles in bars, that’s all. Oh, and one
member reported that a man pulled the
badge out of his lapel in Collins Street,
threw it down, and jumped on it.
Batman: You have this army now,
what do you propose to do? March on
Harrison House waving banners and
singing anti-football songs?
Dunstan: Actually, it is difficult to
know exactly where we should go from
here. I feel that we have to be like
the followers of Martin Luther King,
not like the followers of Cassius Clay.
We are a solemn body of protest. I’m
glad you mentioned the anti-football
songs. We do have an anti-football song
being made by one of the record groups.
This will be sung by one of our leading
protest singers and we expect it to hit
the charts. There are plans, too, for
AFL books of matches and AFL
bumper stickers. We have also thought
of issuing non-season tickets, entitling
members not to attend matches for the
season, and some members would like
to construct a 235-yard banner for
erection around the balcony of the
MCG. This would be similar to the
banner used by the Collingwood Cheer
Squad, except that ours would be
totally blank, a silent protest, you see.
Batman: What about the footballers,
how are they reacting?
Dunstan: They have been undermin-
ing us with great subtlety. Norm Smith,
coach of Melbourne, has been seen wear-
ing a badge; so, too, has Lou Richards,
and Harry Beitzel, the umpire, has even
been selling them. This is dangerous.
Batman: How long can you keep up
the campaign?
Dunstan: I don’t know. Anti-football
talk is driving me out of my mind. I
don’t talk anything else.

ON THE
MARGIN
The Thing from
Black Jack's
Lagoon
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
IT IS A SHAMEFUL admission I have
to make, but it has been on my mind a
long time and I am going to come out
in the open with it. I have lived in
Australia, man and boy, for half a
century, and 1 still don’t understand
what the Country Party is all about.
It is easy enough to understand the
Liberal Party. I think I understand the
Labor Party, too, though it is harder
than it used to be. But when I try to
focus my mind on the Country Party I
can see no distinct outline. There is
only a sort of swirling fog or blur, with
the voice of Mr. John McEwen occa-
sionally rumbling from inside it.
Once or twdce in the past I thought
for a moment that I was beginning to
grasp some definite idea behind the
Party, to distinguish it from other
Parties. A knowing friend said to me:
“It’s really a pressure group for farmers
—getting butter subsidies and good
prices for wheat and that sort of thing.”
The program did not sound specially in-
spiring. It was hard to imagine a states-
man making passionate, moving
speeches about the price of wheat. But
the pressure-group theory did seem to
offer a clue to the Country Party’s iden-
tity. To follow it up I read an official
booklet about the Party’s policy, pub-
lished before the last Federal election.
I found to my disappointment that
the booklet put no great emphasis on
the interests of farmers. The front page
bore in large type the words: “Honor to
God—Loyalty to the Crown—Justice
for All.” It was pleasing to know that
the Country Party was opposed to
atheism. Likewise that it harbored no
treasonable intentions toward H.M. The
Queen, and that it subscribed to the
Australian ideal of a fair go. But this
creed had no obvious connection with
the price of wheat or butter.
The booklet actually went to some
pains to point out that the Country
Party was sticking up for the interests
of secondary industry that is to
say, city people as well as primary
industry. It gave no support to the
theory that the Country Party was a
rural pressure group. It seemed to be
barracking for just about everybody
except Communists, of whom the Party
took a rather dim view. The official
booklet left me more confused in mind
about the Country Party than ever.
The essence of my problem is
summed up in the dual character of
the Party’s leader. In his role as Minis-
ter for Trade, Mr. McEwen is pet-,
fectly understandable and also impres-
sive. Part of his job is to drive hard
bargains with overseas Governments,
and he is singularly well equipped to do
it. With his stern and determined mien
he arouses in opponents the same kind
of uneasiness that the Scottish clans-
men did at the Battle of Killiecrankie.
(Perhaps the most heartless instruction
any newspaper editor could give to a
young photographer would be: “Go
out and get a happy, smiling picture of
Jack McEwen.”) But the moment Mr.
McEwen steps out of his role as Mini-
ster for Trade and puts on the robes
of Leader of the Country Party, he
ceases to be clear and comprehensible.
He becomes a dark and mysterious
warlock. He is still unsmiling and in-
dignant but about what?
Lately he has been indignant because
some country people say he is too much
in favor of import duties. But I was
brought up to believe that country
people generally were opposed to im-
port duties. Why is the Leader of the
Country Party indignant with country
people for behaving like country people?
Goodness knows.
I suspect that many others are
baffled. You will notice that nobody
hates the Country Party. You don’t see
written on walls: “Down with Country
Party skunks!” At the same time, no-
body seems to feel intensely in favor of
it. There are no young zealots carrying
banners inscribed: “My Country Party,
right or wrong!” It is hard to either
love or hate something which you can t
understand.
Some of my own trouble in under-
standing the Country Party may be due
to the fact that I am a totally urban
Australian. Kalgoorlie bore me, Mel-
bourne and Sydney undid me. I once
travelled as far w'est as Parramatta to
see a football match, but was frightened
away by the violence of the spectators.
My mental chaos really goes back to
the late Sir Earle Page, who somehow
got the Country Party mixed up in my
mind with medical benefits. But J
haven’t given up trying to understand it
yet. I intend to plod on through the
mist, still nursing the unconquerable
hope, still clutching the inviolable shade
of the Country Party.

Our wines: they
travel like high-
spirited schoolboys
“OF COURSE, your wines don’t travel
well, do they?” In a recent week in
London I have heard this question too
many times. In the stew of contradic-
tions, assertions, prejudices, and mys-
ticisms that apparently make up the
average, ignorant English wine con-
sumer, it rises quickly to the top like
a large blob of fat. And gives me much
the same kind of indigestion.
For there is little justification in the
rhetorical question. Our wines have
a robustness that I have discussed
before, and this very quality is the one
that, under normal conditions, ensures
arrival in top condition. Rather like a
bunch of high-spirited schoolboys
getting off the train.
Of course, we may ask, what are
normal conditions. I am told that ship-
hold heat has caused the top of the
dashboard of every 1600 G.T.C. Alfa
Romeo in Australia to lift from the
rest of the fascia; an item of news that
hardly makes all this struggle worth-
while. And in San Francisco I tasted
a Seppelts Rhymney Chablis that had
been Hollywood Expressed from Los
Angeles, and found it oxidised (its big
brother, Moyston Claret, arrived none
the worse for wear).
Yet in London I tasted over 20
standard lines that we all know at the
excellent Australian Wine Centre in.
Soho, and found them all in their usual
sound condition. There appeared to be
no difference in any of them and, in
fact, I even picked a few of them
blind, Er . . . masked, that is. And
we have the example of famous 1945
Lindemans Cawarra Riesling, nick-
named the London Hock, that rested
ln a cellar in the U.K. for many years
to be returned in the early ’6os. By
this time it had travelled nearly 30,000
miles and, though there was bottle
variation, tasted just like a good old
Hunter white should.
So it appears our wines do travel,
,and travel well. What of others?
For years I have heard of the quality
°f Swiss wines, “though they do not
travel.” This week I have been able to
taste them in Switzerland.
And what a way to taste the Vins du
“ays. On garden terraces overlooking
the Lake of Geneva; in tiny vineyards
high on the stepped hills that provide
a giant stairway down to the water;
more than 6000 ft. up, whilst looking at
Mont Blanc and the Eiger and the
jubilant peaks of the French and Swiss
Alps; and on the marvellous paddle-
boats that feed and ferry passengers
all over the place. (Couldn’t Port
Jackson Steamship Company learn
something from them!)
What Vins! What a Pays! The whites,
the dominant wines, are made mostly
from Chasselas in the area in which I
spent most time. This was around Cully
and Montreux not far from Lausanne.
The reds are from Pinot Noir and
Gamay. The famous Johannisberger,
made mostly from Sylvaner, I found
rather unimpressive.
The qualities I liked most about
nearly all the wines, both white and
red, were their freshness and lightness.
You rarely see any older than ’65.
The Swiss drink them in quantity,
apparently with little effect. This is not
surprising, since it appears the alcohol
could be lower than ten percent, by
volume. Lightness, as against robust-
ness, once again. And I noticed that
after pouring a round of drinks they
replaced the cork. Since they couldn’t
be more hospitable or generous I asked
why.
“So that the spirit of the wine can-
not escape.” Obviously they go flat and
lose their flavor characteristics quickly.
Lightness again.
Nearly everyone agreed that the
wines do not travel well. “Alors! Who
wants them to!”
Finally, I went to a tasting to examine
some local gold-medallists. This was at
the Clos Baussan, run by the Crot
Brothers. Marcel, the eldest, was the
host. Though conversation was difficult,
we hit it off splendidly. The free
masonry of wine?
“Has your family always owned the
building and vineyards?”
“Not the family exactly, but always
of or around this family, or the people
here.”
“How old is the building?”
“I don’t know. But once the roof of
a cellar was in danger, so they put soma
oak beams in to strengthen it. The age
is marked.”
We examined the date by candlelight.
It was 1679.
“Do your wines travel?”
“Who knows? Who cares? But they
do last! I pick all my grapes later than
the others.”
Tasting proved the point. Monsieur
Crot’s wines were both stronger and
sturdier than most of the other wines I
had tasted. I particularly liked a 1964
Cotes de Baussan Pinot Noir which had
good flavor and soft but marked tannin.
Apparently they last, and what is more,
the cork was not replaced between
glasses. I bought a few bottles to travel
and keep. But this is not the answer as
far as Swiss wines are concerned. To
enjoy them and this magnificent
country you should travel to Switzerland
to taste them. You are likely to leave
in far better condition than when you
arrived.

Weighty politics:
Holt, Mr. Australia
and Mr. Universe
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
MR. AUSTRALIA 1967 comes up the
Vella Health Studio stairs and Fred
Vella presents him like a piece of
wedding-cake on a plate. Carlo Zumbo,
he says, giving him a push, d’you want
to talk to him here? Carlo is smiling and
shy, but pleased. Even in Fred’s murky
porch with its ship’s bell hanging in
place of a push-button which the, kids
rang and had him running up and down
all day, the devils, even in this night-
club light Carlo’s thigh muscles show
beneath those knife-creased slacks. What
about seeing Mr. Australia in action?
OK.
The gym here in Kings Cross is filling
with men who come after a day’s work
to spend the evening building their
bodies to bigger and better proportions.
They heave and push weights silently,
watching results in mirrors, breathing
in and out, some resting or perhaps
collapsing, it’s hard to tell, but anyway
concentrating. Fred doesn’t know how
many customers he has. What with
organising the Mr. Australia competi-
tion and everything, his books aren’t up
to date; but he does know 75 percent
are English, and it costs $6O a year,
which works out to 47 cents or some-
thing a session, and his studio has more
equipment than any other in Australia:
11,0001 b. of it, stacked under PLEASE
RETURN EQUIPMENT signs, and a
special corner selling goodies like, Bodi-
Bilda, W.G. (for weight-gaining)
Supplement, Tiger Bomb, and Musle-
Eze to reduce the agony of it all.
Carlo walks out in eau-de-nil swim-
ming-trunks and white tee-shirt and
says what shall he do? Well, your
stuff, replies Fred a bit sharply. You
can tell Fred’s the boss. He makes the
rules and throws out anyone who breaks
them. His two brothers, for instance,
they went. And when the entire Pro-
fessional Section of the Mr. Australia
competition greased themselves he was
in two minds about chucking them out.
However, that would have left a nasty
gap in the program, so he settled for
commanding amateurs and juniors not
to go near the Nivea or they would get
a cold shower.
Carlo busies himself with squats and
snatches and a bit of bar-work. Fred
says there’s no envy in body-building
They go up to one another and say
hey! what have you been doing to your
chest? and pass on advice. All the same
a straight-limbed youth in voluminous
football shorts looks with a certain
yearning toward Mr. Australia’s
physique. Actually, Carlo is a genuine
Before-and-After example of what body,
building can do for a man, but, unlike
Skinny on the beach, he took it up be-
cause he was too fat. If there’s one
thing you cannot do in this business it
is build muscle on to fat, so Fred’s first
move was to put him on light weights
with repetition, which brought Carlo
down from to list, in three
months. Mama mia, said his Italian
father, you will disappear! Fred then
put him on heavy weights, with less
repetition, and in three months he went
back to 12st. This time it was all
muscle, calves and biceps equalling
exactly.
So here’s Carlo at 20, an Italian
migrant of three years, collecting
titles like crazy; 1964’s Mr. Junior Aus-
tralia, 1965’s second Senior Amateur,
1966’s and 1967’s Mr. Australia, and,
somevftiere en route, fitting in Mr.
Southern District. Where does he go
from here—this factory machinist from
Burwood who has more to offer the
world than washing-machine motors?
Yc*s, well that’s just it. This is what
Fred’s been saying. Here’s a man who
stands a good chance of winning Mr.
Universe in London next September
and improve Australia’s image at the
same time, but who’s going to pay his
expenses? Carlo can’t, and Fred’s not,
the way trophy costs are going. This
year’s cups set him back $250! What
he wants is to start an association to
give Australia’s 65,000 body-builders
official status. He thinks the Govern-
ment should help. And—Fred believes
in going to the top —he is going to write
a letter to Harold Holt . . .
Carlo listens in a state of semi-
comprehending wonderment. His Eng-
lish is not too strong —ah—films is what
he wants. Like Steve Reeves, you know,
Mr. Universe in that Hercules film . . .
And advertising. The trouble is, says
Fred, people have this thing about
muscles. The milk people, for instance,
they say they don’t want women to
think milk makes them look like that;
who would drink it? Sometimes agencies
call in for a man to, say, lift a hammer
and they choose someone without
muscles. Well, they say, it looks as if
you’ve got to be super strong to lift the
thing. It’s not normal. But he, jabbing
Carlo’s biceps, he looks normal if he
relaxes.
I’ll tell you, says Fred, the only
reason why people pull faces at muscles
is because they’re jealous. They haven t
got them, and they wish they had.
It is to be hoped that Mr. Holt sees
it the same way.

THE FOOTY
CROWDS
IN THE YEAR 1967, the City of Mel-
bourne was captured by a revolutionary
band of potters from the Eltham foothills.
The wily enemy struck on a Saturday after-
noon in mid-winter. The streets of the city
were deserted, the watchposts unmanned.
There was little resistance.
These are the last pictures taken of pre-
revolutionary Melbourne. The only casualty
in the coup was the photographer who was
injured by a flying football. The last entry
in the official annals of the former regime
records the cryptic message: “The Demons
defeated the Saints.”

Mind stretching
“PSYCHEDELIC” is the vogue-word
of the moment. It has been defined by
no less an authority than “Life” maga-
zine as meaning “mind-stretching.” But
what is its derivation?
The “psych-” part is familiar, com-
ing from the Greek word for “soul” or
“spirit.” But “-edelic” has no known
ancestry in Greek or Latin.
The Bulletin offers a free trip to
Goonland by LSD to the first philo-
logist to provide a correct solution.
Tripping up the trippers
NEW ZEALAND authorities have
just realised that whereas marijuana is
listed under the Narcotics Act and
carries a maximum penalty of 14 years’
jail and a $2250 fine, LSD comes
under the Poisons Act with a maximum
penalty for peddling of $450.
The New Zealand Government now
proposes to have LSD scheduled under
the Narcotics Act. Said Police Com-
missioner Urquhart: “We want to stamp
it out before it gets a hold as it has in
some other countries.”
Mightier than the sword
ONE OF THE utility items on the
desk of the Prime Minister, Mr. Holt,
in his newly renovated and modernised
office is an inconspicuous black
fountain pen, which to the sharp eye
appears to be just a little thicker than
normal.
The reason: it is a high-powered
microphone designed to convey every-
thing said in the office to the equally
high-powered tape recorder built into a
cupboard in the adjoining room. But
a person unknown (or certainly not
named) fouled everything last week
'°y trying to use the “pen” for its normal
purpose. Orders have gone out for
urgent repairs.
Choosing the mouserace
TELEVISION NEWSREADER David
Low has been reported as “leaving the
ratrace for the mouserace,” which is one
way to compare Sydney and Perth, but
not an adequate description of David
Low’s decision.
“I’ve let myself get too caught up in
earning a living here,” he said last week
at Movietone, where he was nostal-
gically recording his last newsreel com-
mentary after 16 years. “And I’ve
neglected some of the things I’ve always
wanted to do, like television docu-
mentary work and writing. In the end,
I hope to retire to my typewriter
altogether.”
His last day at Movietone was bring-
ing memories flooding back of witty,
hard-hitting Jack Davey, for whom Low
wrote newsreel commentaries in the
19505. “I’d write a commentary with a
tag line, Jack would read it, then
change one word, a word which would
make it great. He had a computer
brain, and, at times, a cruel wit. I was
the brunt of it on occasion. He was a
very lonely man, though. I think his
energy kept him so far out in front
of everyone else that he was always
alone.”
Low worked with both Dyer and
Davey in those booming years of the
radio quiz show, and was around to see
both men’s debut in television, one a
success, the other a surprising failure.
“Jack seemed to have the attitude that
television was just radio with pictures
—and he wouldn’t let anyone tell him
differently. I waited for five years before
I tried television, because it was so
‘here they come, there they go.’ ”
Another figure who entered Low’s
reminiscences last week was his famous
uncle, Sir David Low, the cartoonist.
“He left Australia in 1925, so I didn’t
know him well, but we always cor-
responded, probably because I was the
only one in the family to work in com-
munications. His first political cartoon
was published when he was 11. Over
the years he developed an amazing
simplicity of line. Most of our family
like to draw, but I think my younger
brother is the only one who will ever
do anything about it. He seems to have
talent.”
World War II intervened before
David Low had decided where his real
talent lay. After it, he decided on radio,
an audition at 2UW followed and a
few days later he was working. That
was the first big decision of his career.
Now he’s made an even bigger one.
“It sounds corny, but I’ve always felt
television had the power to do a lot
for world peace —just by getting people
all over the world to communicate with
one another. I’d like to do a series of
documentaries in South-East Asia, show-
ing Australia to the Asians and Asia
to us. I’d like to do one on faces all
round the world. These are only dreams
so far, but I’d like to think they’re
possible.”
The Lawson Industry
THIS YEAR’S CENTENARY of the
of Henry Lawson will probably
jnean an upturn in sales of his works,
but there is no benefit to anyone except
the publishers, Angus and Robertson,
bawson, who died in fairly straitened
Circumstances in 1922, had sold the
copyright of his work outright to
various people during his lifetime.
Angus and Robertson later acquired
°ok rights from the Public Trustee
a .nd his works have been selling steadily
since.
Tor the centenary, Angus and Robert-
son brought out two books, one a
definitive edition of his verse, compiled
by Dr. Colin Roderick, the other a
selection of his humorous stories, chosen
by Cecil Mann. Another book expected
to sell well is “The Lawson Tradition,”
edited by Douglas Stewart.
Angus and Robertson have eight
Lawson titles in print. Best-sellers are
two collections of stories for schools,
which sell 12,000 a year between them,
and “Henry Lawson’s Best Stories,”
selected by Cecil Mann, which sold out
4000 copies last year and is being re-
printed now.
In 1964 a monumental three-volume
collection of Lawson stories, once again
edited by Cecil Mann, was eagerly
sought after by Australian collectors;
3000 copies of each volume were sold,
which Angus and Robertson say is pretty
good for an expensive edition.
Angus and Robertson also share the
rights on any recording, broadcasting,
theatre, television, or film ventures.
They are hoping that the American film
company which took out an option on
a series of Lawson stories will go ahead
with plans to film them.
ALL THEIR OWN WORK
For Australians to feel they are
entitled to a substantial equity in
important mining discoveries with-
out having been involved in the ex-
ploration is like claiming an interest
in a Melbourne Cup winner after the
race; the punter should have shown
interest at the yearling sales.

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES ON THE
ECONOMY
Everything was up
except
the stock-market
FORGET ABOUT all that stuff that
says the stockmarket ended 1966-67
ten percent higher than when it came
in. True, the figures in the Sydney
share price index say so, and the Mel-
bourne index of 50 leaders is up at
its highest point ever. But take out
BHP and all the other mining stocks
and the investment section of the share
market looks very dull indeed. In fact,
it is little different from the level it
stood at exactly 12 months ago. And
it is really well down from its 1964
peak.
But is the investment outlook the
same as it was 12 months ago? Cer-
tainly not; it is a darned sight better.
Either the stockmarket w r as too high
then- —or it is too low now. And the
weight of evidence seems to suggest
that it is a bit on the low side now.
The trouble is, it will take a lot to
move it. But it seems a fair bet that
share prices generally will be a lot
better this time next year.
The reason will be performance; by
next year, company results will be
much improved, not only because of
a general improvement in the rate of
economic advance, but also because of
the specific stimulus that will come
from the big developments now taking
place in Australia. (All that mining
in W.A. should do great things for
stocks like Swan Brewery, for example.)
But company performance is only one
of the things that moves markets;
almost as important is the supply of
money for buyers to spend on shares.
In recent times, when company
performance has been generally mod-
est, there has seldom been so much
money around; loans are fairly easy to
come by and savings are high. Yet this
money either is not finding its way to
the stockmarket, or else is doing noth-
ing more than offsetting the departure
of U.S. and U.K. cash from our mar-
kets under the pressure of their domes-
tic economic problems.
There is no doubt about the prob-
lems that these U.S. and UK capital
outflow restrictions could cause; the
Treasury had a lot to say about this
last week in its Information Bulletin,
in which it stressed that there was
more to the foreign investment prob-
lem than simply seeing it as a balance
of payments matter. It pointed out that
it is not good enough simply to replace
the inflow of capital with highei*
export earnings, and think that is
enough; if the level of investment in
Australia is to be maintained, higher
export income must not only be
earned, it must be channelled into
investment a far more difficult task.
The risk is that a large part of this
higher export income would go into
consumption expenditure, both at home
or abroad, instead of being directed
through savings into investment.
So, what would happen to the stock-
market if the Reserve Bank decided
that the rate of expansion needed
to be held in check and, so, tigh-
tened up the money situation? (It
pulled in a few bank reins last week.)
Already it looks as if a possible short-
age of money available for invest-
ment could limit the rate of market
advance unless the stockmarket
puts on such a fine performance
of company results that it attracts all
sorts of people back into the market.
And, anyway, money would only get
tight again if things began to move
ahead a bit too quickly, which would
itself be a symptom of better times for
the market.
So things may not be as bad as
they seem. And there is a fair chance
of a lot of the speculative winnings
from the recent mining boom finding
their way back into the ordinary share
market after the lustre eventually fades
from the mining post (this does not
mean that mining shares will fall, but
that the wild moves may sober down
a bit into a steadier situation).
NO MATTER what the demand from
inside or the pressure from outside Aus-
tralia, are not going to get any
foreign banks coming in here to upset
the cosy competition that exists between
Australia’s “free enterprise banks” and
the one that, with elephantine modesty,
admits to being the biggest. There is a
great queue of foreign banks, particu-
larly in North America and Japan,
wanting to set up shop in Australia.
There are some good reasons wTy we
won’t let them. All we allow is for
them to open “representative offices”
here, where they can look after their
own interests —but not do any actual
banking business.
Last w'eek the Prime Minister, Mr.
Holt, restated wdth a great deal of firm-
ness the Government’s strongly held
view' that it would not issue authority
for overseas banks to establish them-
selves here. This followed last week’s
suggestion in The Bulletin that the
Americans had wanted this concession
(along with some rise in tobacco exports
here) if they were to remove or lighten
the iniquitous tariff they impose on our
wool exports to the US.
The main reason there seems little
chance of foreign banks ever cornino-
here as bankers (although some have
sneaked in as backers of hire purchase
and “fringe-banking” operators) is that
this is one instance where the best
interests of Government officials and
bankers coincide. There seems no doubt
that such a move would radically change
the character of the Australian banking
system—which might not be a bad
thing when you think of the dull way
the banks have gone about their task
of creating what ought to be a lively
commercial - bill market, for example.
But apart from creating a more com-
petitive atmosphere in banking (and
bringing even more wasteful duplication
of banking buildings and functions than
already exists here), the introduction of
foreign banks would disturb the system
of official control of the economy.
No doubt the Reserve Bank would
be most reluctant to see the end of
the present arrangements whereby all
it has to do to control the banking
system is to tell eight banks (one of
them a Government one, anyway) what
they are to do. For not only would
the addition of foreign banks increase
the number, it would also spread the
banking system in another way that
would make it more difficult to man-
age. For at least all the local banks
have Australian attitudes to problems;
even the two British-owned banks in
Australia, the ANZ and the ESA, are
Australian-ish and would have the
national interest as a high priority in
their thinking. But foreign banks
could well have different objectives;
they would certainly have different
loyalties. Disagreements between the
Reserve Bank and them might not be
on the matters of degree that so elec-
trifies the air at times when the eight
local banks get cross, but could well be
differences of kind. For example, cur-
rency speculation could be a question
on which foreign banks may take a
different view from the local ones.
The main test, however, is what
would granting this permission mean
for Australia. The foreign bankers say
it would increase the flow of funds
from overseas to this country. The
locals reply that this is not so; that
the first thing the foreign banks would
do if they set up branches here would
be to accept as many deposits as they
could from locals (particularly from
local branches of U.S. companies now
operating here) and that this would
reduce the incentive they at present
have to find funds for Australian pro-
jects from overseas.
There is no doubt that we are get-
ting the best of both worlds the way
things are; we have the U.S. banks
acting as overseas consortium managets
and fund-raisers for our major P lo '
jects and we don’t have to give them
a slice of our business in return,
seems sensible to leave it that way
as long as we can get away with it.

AUSTRALIA
Despairing sighs of fatalism
at the bumbling bonanza
The 1967 Premiers ’ Conference... immense increase
THERE IS NOTHING very solemn or
scientific about the .processes by which
the nation’s destinies are resolved. Cer-
tainly comic situations abounded when
the polities of the Commonwealth and
the States met to haggle last week in
Canberra at the Loan Council Premiers’
Conference.
The most honest reaction to the out-
come of the two-day affair was N.S.W.
Premier Bob Askin’s “Ah, not bad,”
plus the frank comment: “I haven’t had
the chance to go away and work it all
out yet.”
Then there had been the conference
with the new with-it Premier from
South Australia, at which a be-jeaned
young aide kept cutting in. And the
flood of allegations from officials that
the Commonwealth Treasurer had
mucked things up. And then the
counter-story that the confusion was the
result of a mistake by one ,of these
same officials. Who knows?
And Queensland’s approach to the
Press hardly looked sophisticated when
their Premier was standing in a corner
of a room in Parliament House reading
in nervous staccato from a tiny piece
of paper he could hardly see: “Press
statement. It was a case of mixed for-
tunes, said the Premier Mr. Nicklin in
Canberra. After the meeting . . .”
Which demonstrated well that the
best-laid plans of official advisers often
get swept away on such occasions, and
that our political leaders are just about
as bamboozled by the complexity of
Commonwealth-State financial relation-
ships as most Australians.
The outcome, anyway, was jolly good
for the States. With despairing sighs of
fatalism, Canberra Treasury officials
afterward said they thought the Com-
monwealth had just given the biggest
increase ever in the payments to the
States.
General Financial Assistance grants,
determined by a strange mathematical
formula, are estimated to rise s74m. to
a figure just above s9oom. The money
for works and housing rose by a more
modest s32m. to $677m., but the real
bonanza came with the completely new
deal for “semi-Government and local
authority borrowing,” the multiplicity
of electricity, coal, gas, and sewage cor-
porations outside the formal structure
of the State Governments. They are
able to get up to $311m., or s6om. or
23 percent more than last year. In
addition, the uncontrolled sector was
expanded, borrowing up to a new ceil-
ing of $300,000 being unrestricted.
“There’s hope for a bit of wangling
there,” said one Premier, glass in hand,
cigar in mouth.
And, of course, the Commonwealth
people have to bear in mind the fact
that their Government is committed to
vast new expenditures outside this.
Specific Purpose Payments to the States
for Universities, new Colleges of
Advanced Education, roads and the like
are estimated by Treasury officials to go
up from around s4oom. to over ssoom.
Which tots up to the immense in-
crease of between s2som. and s2Bom.
on last financial year’s total of $2130m.
This is a rise of between 11 and 13
percent, and, as the Prime Minister said
very seriously at his Press conference:
“Anyone in business who can look to
that sort of increase in funds available
is doing very well.”
The State Premiers, whatever whinges
they may have made afterward, did
far better than they expected and
better than the Commonwealth in its
more organised moments intended.
Just before the conference the
Treasury released its annual pre-
Budget survey of the Australian
economy, and the foreword contained
the warning that “if public authority
expenditure (is) to run on at an un-
checked pace, total spending in the
economy may well outstrip the growth
of resources and bring prices and ex-
ternal balance under excessive strain.”
In the text of the statement it argued
that “some steadying (of Government
expenditures) could be timely.”
But, of course, since the $2400m.
doled out last week in Canberra repre-
sents two-thirds of the revenues of State
Governments and one-third of the
revenue of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, any overall tempering of the
pace of public spending is made very
difficult now.
The Budget
Unending demands
COMMONWEALTH TREASURY
officials speak ominously about the
defence demands which are coming be-
fore them in Budget preparation. They
appreciate the need for new equipment
—like extra helicopters and transport
planes—but are increasingly outspoken
about the need for rethinking policy
on military purchases. There was
great interest in Canberra departments
in the argument in last week’s Treasury
bulletin that the way F-11l bomber
costs are rising we might do far better
to spend the money we have ear-
marked on the cheaper and proven
Phantom bombers. There is increasing
feeling that the Service Departments
should not be allowed to continue to
insist on having the very best equip-
ment when more of the next-best would
give us a greater military return on the
taxpayer’s money.
The Treasury review of the economy
contained a long section, frankly out-
lining its worries about the “ever-
mounting” demands on public authori-
ties. “They are subject to continuous
pressure for concessions in charges and
open or concealed subsidies. The
demands are directed to a multitude
of particular needs education, care
of the aged and indigent, health ser-
vices, housing, defence, decentralisation,
the development of particular areas or
regions the list has no bounds.”
It went on with the statement:
“Satisfying these demands must make
claims on the national resources, which
are limited . . . the resources taken to


meet one need are not available for
another. What the public sector takes,
the private sector cannot have. Here
the authorities are faced with difficult
choices.”
So, obviously, the Treasury Depart-
ment is attempting to prepare the pub-
lic for an unpopular Budget. Last
week’s meeting with the Premiers is
obviously going to make it extremely
difficult for the Commonwealth to
avoid tax increases in the Budget in
August. A good deal will still depend
on the way the Government judges the
trend of the economy. Many officials
believe the economy already has quite
enough steam in it. They believe that,
once the current high level of building
approvals works its way through to
new building projects, any slack that
exists will be fully taken up. They also
believe we would pull imports uncom-
fortably high if we were to let the
economy run to a higher pitch. And
so the strong stimulatory effect of the
“States’ bonanza” will have to be off-
set by the dampening force of taxes.
There is, however, a hopeful sign in
the air, and that is what appears to
be a high current rate of growth of
productivity. Despite the fact that
spending and output have been rising
strongly this year, they have been
doing so without drawing very heavily
on labor. Unemployment has remained
at the fairly high level of 1.7 percent
for some time now, and in May (the
latest month for which figures are
available) it rose slightly. Treasury
people will be waiting for the next
figures with interest. A continuation
of this trend would greatly strengthen
the hand of the doves within the
Government, as it would lend great
weight to the argument that expansion
of the economy can be safely allowed
to have its head. Otherwise the
Treasury hawks just must win through
and Australians will be forced to
endure an escalation of taxing.
Teachers
New weapon
SURFERS FOLLOW the waves;
golfers follow the sun; and teachers
follow the State Premiers to Canberra
for every Loan Council and Premiers’
Conference. It’s all part of the teach-
ers’ campaign to win Commonwealth
and State Government recognition that
more money must be devoted to edu-
cation.
For the past 15 years officials of
the Australian Teachers’ Federation
have dogged the Premiers’ footsteps
to Canberra every year, even going so
A letter from a younger Harold Holt
far as to stay in the Hotel Canberra
with the six Premiers.
The day the Conference starts, the
teachers take out big advertisements in
the morning newspapers outlining the
needs of education. When the Premiers
arrive at Parliament House they are
met by a swarm of teachers who press
into their hands a list of education
demands.
After the conference the teachers
can be seen in the lobby of the Hotel
Canberra trying to pick up snippets
of information from State officials and
Pressmen.
This campaign of attrition is slowly
succeeding. Most Premiers have now
agreed to meet teachers’ delegations in
their home States beforehand rather
than be badgered on the front steps
of Federal Parliament. One mark of
success was that Frank Nicklin, of
Queensland, recently met teachers in
his office for the first time since he
became Premier in 1957.
Although they have succeeded in
getting their demands heard by State
Premiers, the teachers have no inten-
tion of giving up their annual pilgrim-
age to Canberra. With the current
state of Commonwealth-State financial
relations, the big ear to get at is the
Commonwealth Government.
And for this the teachers have
found a valuable new weapon. The
New South Wales Teachers’ Federa-
tion was going through its old files in
the throes of moving, recently, when it
came on a letter it received in April,
1939, from none other than Harold
Holt, then a backbencher in Federal
Parliament.
In this letter Holt says he fully
supported increased provision by the
Fedexal Government for education.
“It is my firm belief,” Holt said, “that
no government can spend public
moneys more economically or to better
advantage than in raising the general
standards of health and education of
its people.”
Wheat
Storage problem
ON THE EVE OF the Loan Council
journalists were summoned to a con-
ference at the Hotel Canberra by the
chairman of the Wheat Board Dr
Allan Callaghan.
In his delightful though slightly
inconsequential way, he talked about
all aspects of the Board’s work and his
hopes and fears for the future. The
hardest piece of news was that our
latest sale to China was for cash and
that credit sales may be a thing of
the past.
He also had a shot at predicting
the forthcoming wheat harvest—bigger
and better in northern N.S.W. and
Queensland, most promising in the
West, but quite threateningly bad in
Victoria.
But there was no apparent purpose
to the conference, unless there was
some significance in something he said
at the beginning: “We’ve done damned
well this year to clear this gigantic
crop, but I don’t want the boys to
think we can do it again.” The prob-
lem was mainly in storage and handling
facilities, which were inadequate for
such a crop. Perhaps the conference
was mainly intended to give that a
little publicity.
The Queensland Wheat Board wanted
$lO million to step up its capacity from
22m. bushels to 40m. to meet this year’s
expected harvest. N.S.W. was after sBm.
for extra silos and handling facilities.
It is unlikely that all of Queensland’s
and N.S.W.’s slBm. wheat-storage needs
will be met out of the s32m. overall
increase in State-works loan money.
In Victoria and Western Australia it
is considered that, if not yet adequate,
capacity is moving up at a fairly satis-
factory rate. The Grain Elevators
Board in Victoria is to embark shortly
on a slm. program to cover elevators
and bins at 13 sites completed in time
for the next harvest.
Dr. Callaghan ... not again


B.I.G.
Getting bigger
John McEwen ... flushed a tiger
PROMINENT LIBERALS have been
critical in private discussions of the
Prime Minister’s statement on the
8.1. G. affair. They say he completely
succumbed to pressure from Mr.
McEwen. As he sat at his desk early
in the week reading his statement to
journalists at a hastily arranged con-
ference, it was painfully obvious to
everyone present that he was trying to
get his Party on side with the Leader
of the Country Party.
He went far further than necessary,
Liberals feel. There was no need for
him to completely identify the whole
Government with Mr. McEwen’s
much-attacked tariff policies, since,
whatever the constitutional position,
those policies are the special product of
Mr. McEwen and his department.
In dissociating himself and his
Liberal colleagues from the Basic
Industries Group he was indirectly
giving support to the allegations Mr.
McEwen had made against it.
The beginning of the week saw Mr.
McEwen win a short-term victory in
pressing Mr. Holt into this, but other
Liberals say he has no chance of win-
ning on a longer view. The Country
Party Leader has not merely drawn
public attention to the criticisms being
made by a variety of groups; he has
built up a further reservoir of Liberal
distrust of CP intentions.
The lesson for John McEwen, the
man who thrives on crisis, took a dif-
ferent form. He peppered a bush with
verbal pellets and flushed a tiger.
Nothing had been heard about the
Basic Industries Group since the last
election—and it is doubtful that any-
thing would have been heard from 8.1. G.
before the next election, but for “Black
Jack’s” outbursts of recent weeks. Each
outburst gave 8.1. G. massive promotion
through the mass media. The direct
result of his attacks is that 8.1. G. cashed
m on the publicity he brought to bear
°n the previously almost unknown
group and is now organising on a
national basis.
The Gold Coast
Stout hearts
“SANDBAG PARADISE” the locals
renamed Surfers last week after
150,000 sandbags had replaced the
eroded shoreline where storm-driven
seas took a $5 million bite out of the
Gold Coast within 48 hours.
Erosion had been going on for a
long time, too gradual to be more than
a nagging worry. Then one of
Queensland’s occasional dry-season
depressions brought rain and floods
and, strengthening, drove battering
waves against Surfers and other
beaches.
These undermined sand dunes and,
as they collapsed, carried away great
chunks of the Esplanade, lightpoles,
fences, parking meters, trees, water-
pipes, powerlines, and concrete stair-
ways.
During Tuesday’s night of crisis
nearly 2000 troops and volunteers
battled against pounding seas in an
attempt to hold the beachhead, which
Surfers Paradise, before the storm
. , . and after
was being eaten away at the rate of a
foot an hour, leaving a 25ft. cliff along
the edge of the bitumen Esplanade.
First light on Wednesday morning
showed that homes, multi-unit home-
unit blocks, front lawns, and a
swimming-pool had started to crumble
into the Pacific. But the battering
eased then.
By the weekend the emergency was
over; the people of the Gold Coast
raised the “safe” flags on what remains
of the beach and began a fantastic
rebuilding program.
The Gold Coast Mayor, 71-year-old
Alderman Bruce Small, declared that
“from the mud would rise a new and
better Gold Coast.”
And he outlined some positive action
to fight the combined problems of
canal flooding and beach erosion, pres-
ent and future.
First, a detailed study of damage
caused by both floods and erosion was
to be completed this week; the first
real guide to whether the Council will
apply to Commonwealth and State
Governments for designation of the
Gold Coast as a “benefited” area.
Meanwhile, shorn of its beaches, the
Gold Coast Council is determined to
have a new Esplanade, at least for
bikini-clad tourists to parade along.
The council has engaged a paid work-
force of 1200 contractors and engineers
who are to work indefinitely on a 24-
hours-on and 24-hours-off basis. They
are relieved and backed by 4000 local
residents, businessmen, housewives, and
schoolchildren.
Trucks are arriving day and night, at
the rate of one every minute, with
reinforcing shale being taken from quar-
ries at 80 tons an hour.
The backbreaking shovel work is
being done by businessmen with shovels
issued by council, which hastily pur-
chased every one on sale along the
coast. Others are laying 25,000 sand-
bags filled with a mixture of sand and
concrete every 24 hours.
Perhaps there is more to all this than
fear of losing dollars. This may be the
Gold Coast’s sole opportunity to prove
that there are stout hearts and loyal
minds behind all that gloss and glitter.
Aborigines
Heritage
EXACTLY ONE MONTH after Aus-
tralians voted overwhelmingly to
grant the Commonwealth powers to
legislate for Aborigines, the Govern-
ment released a booklet entitled “The
Australian Aborigines.”
Under the heading of “Integration,”
the booklet laments that Aborigines
lose their traditions as they enter Aus-
tralian society and gives the impression
that perhaps they would be happier
had they kept their nomadic existence.
“The traditional heritage of culture is
in danger of falling apart. Apathy and
‘parasitism’ on the white man have
been understandable reactions in some
circumstances,” the booklet says.


“Gambling, alcohol, and the excite-
ments of the country townships have
often taken the place of the exciting
and ‘gambling’ aspects of the chase
and, indeed, of corroboree and ritual.
The more successful the education
and training of Aborigines for partici-
pation and sharing in general Austra-
lian life, the less meaning will be left
for them in their grandfathers’, and
even fathers’, beliefs, rituals, and man-
ner of living.”
But, if the Department of Territories
is concerned about the difficulties of
assimilation and integration of
Aborigines it need look no further
than 100 miles from the rarefied
atmosphere of Canberra to the small
township of Bega on the N.S.W. coast.
There the N.S.W. Aborigines Welfare
Board plans to house Aboriginal families
in a “white area” of the township. Mr.
Chris Bonnor, a third-year ANU
student who spent two weeks of his
vacation investigating the dispute which
arose, has concluded that Bega residents
were basically not prejudiced towards
Aborigines. “Rather than one of preju-
dice, the prevailing attitude is more
one of passive indifference,” Mr. Bon-
nor says in an article in the journal of
the Aborigines’ Scholarship Scheme,
“Abschol.” “In this respect, Bega people
are little different from other Aus-
tralians,” he says.
“Australians in general would be per-
fectly content to live alongside poverty,
injustice, and inequality so long as it
does not affect themselves, their families,
their property, and their material well-
being. When some or all of these are
threatened, as in this case, people show
a remarkable ability to become aware,
to be informed, and to resist the
threat.”
The sea
Man's enemies
ONCE IT WAS thought that all octo-
puses in the world were harmless, but
following the recent Sydney death of
a young soldier bitten by one, it is
now more common knowledge that all
are not. Australia has the exception,
the Ring Octopus, easily identifiable
by its vivid-blue arm rings which
change color actually flashing out
vivid warning signals.
One of Australia’s best-known experts
on harmful sea creatures, Dr. Endean,
Reader in Zoology at the University
of Queensland, says, “It was not until
1954 when the first fatality occurred
at Darwin that the Ring Octopus was
known to be dangerous to man. There
are two varieties, both looking much
alike. One is found from Fraser Island
south to Victoria, and the other in
waters from Fraser Island northwards.”
Pretty shells are other beach hazards
which give a false sense of security.
Dr. Endean warns against the casual
handling of cone shells found in
Queensland and Northern Australian
waters. Many of these can kill. Sea
urchins, recorded by him in Moreton
Bay and Sydney Harbor in 1962, look
enticing enough to touch, but conceal
poison in flowerlike organisms amid
their spines. Toadfish, common
throughout Australian waters, are small
fish of the puffer species which can
swell out like spheres. These look good
enough to eat, but have poisoned those
who have done so.
The first Australian designed and built
air-cushion vehicle, on a recent test run
on the River Tamar, Tasmania, covered
80 miles in 40 minutes under an all-up
weight of one ton. Air Cushion Vehicles
Australia, of Launceston, say it promises
to be better and cheaper than Hover-
craft or any other overseas a.c.v.
Western Australia
The inexplicable
AMID ALL THE mineral companies’
reports, Premiers’ conference and Loan
Council excitement, government in the
West goes on quietly doing its usual
share of good, bad, and inexplicable. A
sample of the latter was Cabinet’s
action on bushfire prevention work as it
affected Miss Rona Landquist and other
small property holders.
Miss Landquist has a block of outer
metropolitan land where a bushfire
warden called four times last summer
without finding her at home. On the
block she grew more than 50 varieties
of Western Australian wildflowers in
a natural setting, and insists that the
block had been cleared of highly in-
flammable undergrowth. But the Bush-
fire Board felt differently, and without
getting in touch with her, bulldozed
the block and sent her the bill.
A public outcry forced the State
Government to review the Board’s
methods, particularly after others came
forward with complaints.
A committee of Bush Fires Board,
Fire Brigades Board, and Local Gov-
ernment Association representatives de-
liberated and put their views on brush
clearance to Cabinet, which has now
endorsed them. Their recommendations
entail stripping the Bushfires Board of
any right to bulldoze—which is passed
to 23 local government bodies. For
people like Miss Landquist, this could
be simply a passage from the frying-
pan into the fire.
IPEC
New chapter
A FURTHER CHAPTER has been
added to the story of IPEC’s fight all
the way to the Privy Council and back
to operate an interstate air parcel-
express business.
IPEC bought a Douglas DC.4
freighter for their proposed service but
were refused an import licence. Then
they leased a Bristol freighter to air-
express Queensland produce to Cowra
in N.S.W., whence it was trucked to
Melbourne. Some of their sense of frus-
tration came to the surface during the
last Federal election, when the
managing director, Mr. Gordon Bar-
ton, was one of the Liberal Reform
Group leaders in N.S.W.
Now, in London, the DC.4 has been
sold for an undisclosed figure. The
DC.4 was sold because time had
taken its toll of the machine and main-
tenance costs on the idle aircraft were
too high. The IPEC service from Bris-
bane to Cowra has stopped, too. IPEC
believed that it was better not to con-
fuse customers with piecemeal service.
However, their air-freighting between
Melbourne and Launceston continues.
Three round trips, and sometimes up to
eight, a night serve Tasmania. The air-
craft, DC.3s once again, do not belong
to IPEC but to Brain and Brown, a
Melbourne air-charter firm. “We are
getting good back loads from Tasmania
now,” an IPEC spokesman said last
week.

Science
Wool dyeing
CSIRO SCIENTISTS have found and
patented a new way to dye wool, as
revolutionary as the mechanisation of
bread-baking or of brewing. The new
process involves very little heat, is con-
tinuous (up to 10001 b. of dyed wool
per hour), gives brighter colors with
less harm to the fibre, and is compara-
tively cheap ($6000) to set up.
The traditional method has not pro-
gressed much since folk-craft days.
Wool has to be boiled for an hour or
more to let the dye penetrate the fibre
and become fixed. This applies to test
samples, too. The most expert dyers
encounter long and costly delays.
There had been pointers to a way
out. For instance, formic acid was one
of the chemicals known to cause wool
fibres to swell, allowing dye to pene-
trate them immediately, but it was
much too expensive. Then, recently, Dr.
J. Delmonico at the CSIRO’s Textile
Industry Laboratory at Geelong found
that a concentrated solution of urea in
water was a good wool-sweller and dye
solvent with no such objectionable
characteristics as toxicity or corrosive-
ness. Urea is abundant and cheap,
used widely as a fertiliser.
The discovery was developed and
perfected in industrial-scale trials at the
laboratory. The process uses very little
heat, is less harsh on the fibre, does
not turn it yellow and thus reduce the
incoming dye’s brightness. Test samples
can be run in a few minutes, color
fastness is said to be fully comparable.
Dyers are likely to adopt the new
process speedily because of its many
advantages, including cheapness. Its
commercial application can begin as
soon as the CSIRO has built new plant
to turn out the dyeing units. The bene-
fits to the wool industry would be pro-
found, except there is still one unans-
wered question. Can the process be used
on artificial fibres, too?
Sport
Big one
ALTHOUGH ITS MATCHES and
results get little space in today’s sports
columns, men’s basketball is almost
ready to break through as a major
sport in Australia. More than 75,000
players are registered with the Aus-
tralian Basketball Union, as many or
more play it in the schools, and it has
become easily the most-played and
most-followed Olympic sport in the
nation.
The Victorian Amateur Basketball
Association has built a nine-court
stadium with a main-court accommoda-
tion of 2000 spectators to give over

Australians in international basketball
5000 players a place to play each night
of the week. Schools in all States have
realised the efficiency of gymnasia as
against rain-soaked mud patches or dust
heaps, and basketball is played there.
Sydney has a stadium under discussion.
Australian club teams participate in
two Conference series plus the National
title. The Conferences bring in teams
along the east coast —Toowoomba down
to Hobart. Cities now play Can-
berra, Sydney, Hobart, Launceston,
Brisbane, Manly, Newcastle, Dande-
nong, to name a few. All this is build-
ing up strong club interest. Players
travel all over the country and few
have to pay all their expenses.
Already there are rumblings that
some players are being more than just
talked into playing. American coaches
and players are high on the list of
requisites for a top team. Eight Ameri-
can coaches have been employed in the
past few years.
Standards have shot high. In 1956
Australia played its first Olympic series
and learned how far it had to go.
Thirteenth out of sixteen was the re-
sult. In Tokyo, 1964, it had reached
ninth placing and was considered more
than unlucky not to have finished sixth.
A local Melbourne club squad, Church,
toured the U.S.A. last year and won
six games against top university teams.
Now the visit is being repaid. Four
big American teams are touring Aus-
tralia this winter.
Three of these teams are universities
—Oregon, Brigham Young, and Brad-
ley—till now only names on bigtime
American circuits. And these are the
start of what will be a regular inter-
change of visits as the American and
Australian seasons run into one another.
The teams will bring to Australia the
first of the giant players who lope
around the seven foot mark. Six feet
four is considered to be somewhat tiny.
These monsters are not allowed by
rules to stand around the ring, they run
and jump at it with frightening
efficiency. Now the Americans are toy-


;ng with the rules to further prevent
the big men from stuffing the ball down
the basket, which takes away much of
the glamor. _
Australia is beginning to fit into the
“big man” pattern. Amateur clubs
scour schools looking for giants as most
States have the six-feet-four under-17
player in their line-ups. Our biggest
is six-feet-ten, with dozens six-feet-six
or so.
The stage is almost prepared. The
game has a wide base of an ever-
growing number of players and an
array of world class competitors per-
haps all it needs is a promoter to take
it into professionalism.
New Zealand
The crunch
THE MAGNITUDE OF a disaster is
not always immediately apparent. Last
week New Zealanders were beginning to
realise the trouble they were in, some
time after Finance Minister Muldoon
had told them, in Parliament, in a
Budget speech now being recalled as
“doonsday.”
Even before that time the Govern-
ment had ended subsidies on butter and
flour, abolished free milk for schools,
increased postal, telephone, and elec-
tricity charges, and lifted State Housing
rents. As a result, bread went up 100
percent, butter nearly 50 percent, and
there were increases in fish, fruit, vege-
tables, meat, clothing, and footwear, and
public transport charges.
In case people have any money left,
the Government wants them to buy
£NZS special development bonds
(maximum holding £1000) redeemable
at par after six years, with an income
tax deduction as the only benefit. Un-
employment, long almost a dirty word
in New Zealand, has risen from 270
people last winter to more than 5000
at the end of June this year (few jobs
for Australian “working tourists”),
about half of them unskilled workers
from the building and engineering in-
dustries. The Government has ear-
marked half a million pounds for un-
employment benefit, compared with the
£NZ7O,OOO spent last year. Perhaps
Australia should send an immigration
panel?
Meanwhile what might be admoni-
tions in Australia (“keep costs down”
and “reduce spending”) are becoming
desperate cries in a beleaguered coun-
try. New Zealand’s Wool Board Chair-
man, Mr. Acland, sees the 600,000-bale
wool stockpile from last year as a
definite sign of the synthetics crunch,
and says, “We must learn to develop
profits on lower margains . . . raise
efficiency and keep costs down, on the
farm as well as in marketing and trans-
porting the clip.”
Obviously, the best news of last week
for New Zealand was France’s in-
dication that Britain was not going into
the EEC quickly—if ever.
COMMENT
Can we sell everything
and buy nothing?
IT WAS NEVER REALLY on the cards that President Johnson would
reduce the American tariff on wool. Something else may come of it,
of course. Having turned Mr. Holt down on this one, the President
might later give us something that is in his gift. But if Mr. Holt was
doing more than trying a very long shot if he really believed that
he might get this concession he should read a few of the classic
texts on the American political system. Even looking at a few old
movies could remind him that one of the preoccupations of day-to-day
American politics is a concern with Congress lobbies and regional
interests.
Among these are the American woolgrowers and the American textile
industry, and both of these are more important to President Johnson’s
political prospects, both in Congress and at the polls, than the future
of the Australian wool industry. Politically, fighting the war in Vietnam
involves President Johnson in fewer difficulties than would an assault
on entrenched domestic pressure groups. It is the same in Australia.
Because it is a general issue, involving everybody, an Australian Govern-
ment can successfully risk sending an expedition to Vietnam and re-
starting National Service. But it would be a very bold Government
that would risk a direct attack on strong particular interests: the wheat
farmers, for example, or the dairy farmers. Not only party pre-selections,
but national elections could be lost that way. To lament this is a
necessary spiritual exercise, but one should recognise that it is part of
the very stuff of politics.
The central political irony on this particular occasion, of course, is
that someone with a sense of humor in the Johnson administration got
the President out of personal embarrassment with Mr. Holt by suggesting
an unacceptable swop: the Americans would reduce tariffs on Australian
wool if we bought more American tobacco. On the face of it, this
would be a reasonable deal. What we would be likely to lose in increasing
our imports of tobacco might be more than offset by an increase in
the bidding for wool. We should recognise that the Americans put up
a better case than ours: not only would our general economic interest
have been served by the suggested swop, there is also the fact that the
American tariff is at least a tariff and not a straight-out ban, whereas in
our case there is a physical limitation on the import of tobacco.
But the Australian Government could not accept these terms because
of two of our most troublesome conventional wisdoms. Number One:
we have got into the habit of believing that on every occasion, without
exception, it is better that we should produce things domestically and
not import them from abroad. Number two: we also have the habit
of believing that there is something sacred about every section of the
agricultural industry, that anybody who grows anything in Australia
should be protected at any cost.
The reason why we have a tobacco-growing industry on its present
scale comes from these two beliefs. The Government decided only three
years ago to give this industry a very special form of protection so that
it could expand. It created a tobacco lobby. Since tobacco grows from
the earth it had a certain sacred quality and, since this would “save”
us $3O million, it was therefore good. (The wool industry runs at the
rate of $BOO million a year.) Now the tobacco industry represents a
political problem that has stiffened the Government’s manoeuvrability
in serving the interests of our most important export industry.
Where do we end up? Do we seriously believe that we should produce
everything we need in Australia, importing nothing from overseas, while
expecting overseas nations to buy from us everything we want to sell
them? Do we seriously believe that there should never be any changes
in the use of our land, that if dairy cows are grazing on land that
could be better used for beef cattle we should nevertheless preserve
this land at any cost for dairy cattle? Or that farmers growing tobacco
cannot be expected to switch to something else if to do so is in the
interests of our greatest export industry?


Is Holt’s Government
spending too much
(in the wrong way)?
By PETER
SAMUEL
THEY STILL TELL the story of the
public servant, sent with thousands
of others to do farm work during a
war, who was put on to sorting potatoes.
His farmer boss asked him to put small
ones into one barrel, large ones into
another. Coming back half an hour
later he was dismayed to find no sort-
ing done, and the public servant in
tears. He hated making decisions.
Public servants the world over have
for long been the butt of jokes and
cynical comment of this sort. As fot
Australia, one university political-scien-
tist claims that bureaucracy is our
“characteristic talent.” If that is taken
to mean that we are particularly good
at accumulating bureaucrats, most Aus-
tralians would agree; if it means that
our bureaucrats are particularly good,
most Australians would grunt disagree-
ment. We are probably as antipathetic
as any people in our attitudes to
officialdom, government, and politi-
cians. The ivory-towered, legalistic
official, wasting public money in an
inexorably growing Parkinsonian racket,
is a universal popular image of
government. I’m not concerned here
with the extent to which this image
reflects reality, only with the fact that
it is periodically of importance in Aus-
tralian politics. Chifley’s Labor Govern-
ment went out in 1949 substantially on
the boot of public antagonism to a
growing network of government con-
trols and agencies.
Between 1945 and 1950 the Com-
monwealth Public Service proper (ex-
cluding the Post Office) grew by ten
percent or 6000 each year, an increase
which inevitably hit housewives
through its contribution to inflation and
their husbands through the extra taxa-
tion it required. Menzies and the
dynasty he installed got in on the
promises to put value back into the
pound and to dismantle the socialist-
bureaucracy. There wasn’t much hope
of doing the first, though after the
Korean War boom the rate of inflation
was reduced. However, the second
promise was fulfilled, although the new
Government was unable to stop the
momentum of Public Service growth
immediately. The peak was in 1951
when there were 86,000 Commonwealth
public servants and in July of that year
Menzies announced that 10,000 would
be dismissed in fulfilment of his
Government’s election pledges and as
an anti-inflationary measure. They were
dismissed during 1952. Moreover, the
decline continued for two more years,
the Public Service reaching a low of
74,000 in 1954. For the remainder of
the decade there were very small
annual increases, far smaller propor-
tionately than the growth of the Aus-
tralian community it was supposed to
serve. Not until 1964 was the 1951 peak
in numbers regained and only then did
substantial annual growth recommence.
As the graph shows, the pace of Public
Service expansion reached in the Curtin-
Chifley years of government has been
reattained during the past two years.
People have felt the cost of this in the
series of rises in taxation and most
recently in the proposed higher Post
Office charges. A lot of this has been
explained as the price of our big
defence build-up, but, in fact, of the
$llOO million increase in Common-
wealth spending in the past two finan-
cial years, $685 million, or nearly two-
thirds, has been for civilian purposes.
Of the 7000 annual increase in the
number of public servants, only 1500
have gone into the administration of
the defence services. The rest have gone
into the civilian departments, whose
running expenses are going up in the
financial year just ending by 16 per-
cent.
This sort of rapid expansion of the
apparatus of government can mostly be
justified—the Public Service simply did
not keep pace with community needs
in the ’sos; it became demoralised
and grossly undermanned in many cru-
cial areas; it was underpaid; and the
Commonwealth Government faded to
take initiatives. In addition there has
been greater scope for expanding
Government employment rapidly since
1961, both because unemployment was
at first high and more recently because
of an enlarged number of school-leavers
and university graduates becoming
available. Even so, Public Service em-
ployment has for several years now'
been growing at twice the rate of
private employment.
Since 1962 the Commonwealth has
got itself heavily involved in educational
expenditure, in rapidly expanding uni-
versities, technology colleges, teacher
training, and State aid; in major reforms
like decimalisation and railway stan-
dardisation; a large number of boun-
ties and subsidies to non-competitive
rural industries; and quite unpreceden-
ted expenditure on jet airliners for
Qantas and TAA and for new airports
for them to use; the Post Office has
been increasing the total of its equip-
ment 12 percent each year recently.
All this adds up to the fact that Mr.
Holt finds himself in an era of Com-
monwealth Government expansion quite
unlike the quiet Menzies days. Indeed
in its pace it is much more like the
Curtin-Chifley era, as our graph sug-
gests.
No simple analogy makes sense, but
there may be similar problems for the
Government. Voters always tend to
want to have their cake and eat it;
they want a more active Government
providing more and better services
while also wanting them cheap, at low
cost in taxes and charges. And there
is now such momentum in Mr. Holt’s
expansion of Commonwealth activities
that it is going to be extremely diffi-
cult for him to halt the series of tax
rises we have had in the past years and
to end the encroachment into the pri-
vate sector’s workforce. His characteris-
tic affability and his desire to satisfy
everybody around him make it less
likely that he will apply the ruthless
economy measures of which Menzies
was capable. He also has less of his
predecessor’s doctrinaire dislike of Big
Government and Commonwealth initia-
tives in areas of State responsibility.
If the Labor Party is able to bring
itself to act with a measure of political
rationality between now and 1969, it
will try to de-escalate the debate on
foreign affairs and concentrate on the
Government’s potential weak point
its administration of its rapidly expand-
ing responsibilities. Towed further year
by year into the unending business of
protecting weak industries by the Coun-
try Party, the Government may in two
years’ time simply not appear to be
giving good value for the taxpayers
money. Mr. Whitlam could then look
more professional as a national adminis-
trator.
One of the troubles, of course, with
Labor Governments in the past is that
they have rushed rashly into new fields
without having properly designed the
institutional vehicle. Wilson’s aban-
doned “National Plan” is an example.
And Mr. Whitlam does not show any


The graph shows the number of Commonwealth public servants proper (ex-
cluding Post Office workers). On the growth rate of the past two years, the
Commonwealth Service would number 130,000 by 1970, resuming the pace of
expansion set during the 1940s
signs of having thought about how the
machinery of goverment could be made
more efficient.
An agenda for administrative reform
seems in order, and here follows an
outline of what seems most necessary
for giving the taxpayer better value,
and the Government more flexibility:
Put Government business on a
business footing
Half the 200,000-strong army of
public servants work in the Depart-
ment of the Post Office, and this is
beset with problems. It has three
masters. Its staffing is controlled by
the Public Service Board in Can-
berra, its finances by the Common-
wealth Treasury, and its expansion of
services and its rates and charges by
the Government. About the only
people within this vast organisation
who have any autonomy are its en-
gineers.
It cannot possibly function efficiently
on this basis. Like other agencies pro-
ducing salable services it should be
r un as a separate corporation, or pre-
ferably as two separate corporations
one handling mails, the other tele-
communications. And if we want to
keep our general tax bill low, then
Posts and Telegraphs should be made
to pay their way and provide a modest
return on capital just as electricity
authorities, airlines, and banks do.
Another quite unjustified impost on
the general taxpayer goes in subsi-
dising the operation of Australian air-
ports through the Department of Civil
Aviation. A sensible reform would be
to transfer the operation of airports
to an Australian Airports Authority,
which would operate on a business
basis, covering its running costs and
also providing for a return on the ever-
growing bill of taxpayer-money being
sunk in expensive runways and ter-
minal buildings. Harbor trusts charge
their expenses to sea travellers, the
railways have to pay for their stations,
so why shouldn’t people who fly pay
for the services they use? They aren’t
a particularly needy class deserving
of subsidy.
That leaves us with the 100,000
public servants proper.
Consolidate departments
Having hived off the people who run
airports from the Department of Civil
Aviation, there are only the safety men
and the people who arbitrate between
TAA and Ansett left, and they might
as well be put in with the existing
“Department of Shipping and Trans-
port,” renamed on this economy occa-
sion the Department of Transport.
The tiny National Development De-
partment could be combined with
Works, and Health with Social Ser-
vices. Territories could be abolished,
its supervision of New Guinea going
to External Affairs, and of the A.C.T.
and the Northern Territory going to
the Department of the Interior. Cus-
toms and Excise, like Taxation, are
purely an administrative outfit and
should be merged with Treasury.
The greatest economies, however,
would come with an integration of
the defence forces. Canadian experience
has been that a third of the administra-
tive costs of defence can be so saved.
That would be a sum of about $6O
mi'lion a year. Immediate integration
suggests itself in tertiary training, the
RAAF Pt. Cook establishment being
moved to Duntroon, and the Navy
trained there, too, in a full Defence
Academy.
Eliminate internal contradictions
These have developed most acutely
in the Department of Trade and Indus-
try. The “Trade” side, of course, is
concerned with increasing exports and
is interested in trade negotiations which
require us to make concessions in the
way of lowering our tariffs. It should
not be hindered in this work by a
section (the office of Secondary In-
dustry) which as a self-proclaimed
lobby group for manufacturers is only
interested in higher tariffs. At least the
conflict should be brought out into the
open where Cabinet and other depart-
ments can have their say. This is the
one case in which the creation of two
departments in the place of one is justi-
fied. The Office of Secondary Industry
should be made a separate department.
At the same time it should be stripped
of its responsibility in tariff matters, as
these are the interest not only of
industry but of the economy generally.
Tariff policy should be transferred to
the Prime Minister’s Department or
the Treasury and the Tariff Board
should make its reports to the Prime
Minister. This one will have to await
the departure of Mr. McEwen, unfor-
tunately.
One of the present functions of the
Department of Labor and National
Service is to encourage productivity
improvement in industry through con-
vening productivity groups and promot-
ing greater efficiency in other ways.
These functions already overlap with
work being done in the Office of Sec-
ondary Industry, and should be trans-
ferred to it, leaving the Department
of Labor with the work of administer-
ing labor exchanges and promoting
industrial relations.
Clear lines of responsibility
One of the most ridiculous burdens
imposed on the whole Public Service
comes from a piece of legal nonsense
—two conflicting parts of the Public
Service Act, sections 17 and 25. Under
the first the supervision and efficiency


of departments is the responsibility of
; v Public Service Board, while under
th. second the general working and
bu mess of each department is the
responsibility of the Permanent Head.
On a huge range of issues there is un-
derstandably an overlap in respon-
sibility, and endless wrangling, personal
bickering, and inter-departmental
politicking. As if that were not bad
enough, the Treasury with its control
over every item of Government expen-
diture can stick its spanner into the
already gummed-up works. The pro-
duct of these crossed lines of authority
is an unbelievable slowness in action
and a wasteful expenditure of the time
and talents of dozens of men being
paid between $lO,OOO and $lB,OOO a
year by taxpayers.
Cut down to size bureaucracies-
within-bureaucracies
For a start the Treasury Depart-
ment deserves to get the scrutiny which
it so often applies to others. Ironically,
this “economising agency” has expanded
its staff faster than any other part of the
Government. Since 1962 its staff num-
bers have gone up 69 percent as against
the 22 percent for the rest of the
departments, and the 31 percent of
Treasury’s great rival the Department
of Trade and Industry. The last Budget
speech shows that the Treasury pro-
vided for its own running expenses a
tidy $53,596,000 —a 26 percent advance
on last year. Back in 1960 the Treasury
made do with $25 million a year.
The other bureaucracy-within-the-
bureaucracy is the Public Service Board,
which deserves the most critical ex-
amination. As its Chairman, F. W.
Wheeler, admitted in a speech to the
Royal Institute of Public Administra-
tion last year, there is such ambiguity
about its powers that it can really gum
the Government up: “There is no pro-
vision for the Board to have the power
of final decision in the event of continu-
ing disagreement between the Board
and a permanent head. Continuing dis-
agreement merely results in a stale-
mate and, perhaps, the negation of the
objective of co-ordination, namely, the
production of a result.” A remarkable
admission of organisational inadequacy
if ever there was!
The Canadians once suffered from
this ridiculous confusion but they abol-
ished it after a report which said, in
description of the situation which then
prevailed (and still does in Australia):
“Effective execution of authorised pro-
grams is often frustrated by the inabil-
ity to assemble the required number
of people of the right calibre at the
right time. A premium is placed on
overstaffing as a protective device.
Attention is diverted from the real
manpower requirements to an intricate
process of bargaining for increases in
authorised staff levels.” The report
argued for, and got, the integration
of financial and manpower budgeting,
whereby the availability of both money
and people is considered simultaneously
in the internal budgeting process.
For Australia this means that the
Public Service Board should cede its
manpower allocation functions to the
Treasury and to Cabinet. It acts at
present as an autocratic island of irre-
sponsible power, accountable in practice
to no one. It could retain control over
training and supervision of pay and
conditions, though in these things it
should be made accountable possibly
to the Prime Minister’s Department. If
critical staff shortages in Defence,
ASIO, External Affairs, the Bureau of
Mineral Resources, the Prime Minis-
ter’s Department and Trade are to be
overcome, the Government will have to
break the Board’s obsession with uni-
formity in pay and conditions. If it is
serious about filling vacant key jobs,
it will have to pay market rates of pay
rather than cling to meaningless
phrases like “the wage a geologist de-
serves.”
In any case the Public Service Board
itself could be given some slimming
treatment. It had, at last report, 23
executive level (2nd Division) officers
on salaries above $lO,OOO. (By com-
parison the Defence Department has 19
such positions, even the expansive De-
partment of Trade and Industry boasts
only 29.)
Outside research consultants
Survey, research, and advisory work
should more often be done by contract
with outside persons or organisations,
as in the United States. This would
prevent the acquisition of an unneces-
sarily large number of permanent
employees and give departments more
flexibility in their sources of informa-
tion and advice.
Immediate inquiries into the three
blatant examples of public money
being wasted
At the EDP (computer) section of
the Defence Departments, equipment
installed in 1964, once estimated to
cost slsm. and to be operating by
1965, is now estimated to cost s27m.
and is still not working. Further equip-
ment is needed, but according to the
Department of Defence “the extra
capacity required and the cost have
not yet been assessed.” The Depart-
ment can give no firm dates for getting
existing equipment operating. The
principal cause of the trouble is the
adoption of a programming language,
abandoned long ago in the few estab-
lishments overseas which tried it.
There is a gross misdirection of
resources within the 2300-man Bureau
of Census and Statistics. It produces
hundreds of handbooks containing
information so old as to be of interest
only to historians. It continues month
by month to publish a price index
weighted by a production pattern of
1928-29 to 1934-35. But it leaves the
compilation of a monthly industrial
production index to the ANZ Bank,
and a survey of business expectations to
the Bank of N.S.W. and the Chamber
of Manufactures, and it fails to pro-
duce or publish data regarded as
essential for forecasting i n every
advanced country in the world. Series
adjusted for variations due to season-
ality have been promised for more than
a decade, but they just never turn up
and dozens of commentators have to*
do their own very imperfect job.
There should also be inquiry into
the administration of the Australian
National University, which has an
astonishing triplicate structure. When
the old University College and the
Institute of Advanced Studies were
merged by Sir Robert Menzies in 1960
their administrations were supposed to
be merged also; instead, a third
administrative hierarchy was established
to co-ordinate the entrenched two.
Program-budgeting
Adopt within the Commonwealth
Service what the Americans call
program-budgeting, an accounting sys-
tem which isolates the various end
objectives of Government policy and
costs them as discrete programs over a
period of years. This is the system Mr.
Robert McNamara introduced into the
U.S. Defence Department in 1961 and
which President Johnson has ordered to
be extended into all other areas of the
administration.
Program-budgeting has the primary
advantage of presenting decision-makers
with a clearer statement of the alter-
natives they face. At present within
the Commonwealth Service there is
great interest in cost-benefit analysis,
with dozens of courses being run by the
Public Service Board. But they con-
centrate on mathematical sophistry
which cannot be applied extensively
with the existing accounting systems of
the Government. Program-budgeting in
looking beyond the 12-month span of
the annual Budget also has the ad-
vantage of making administrators look
two or three years ahead rather than
muddle through year by single year.
Modernise records
Call in competent management con-
sultants to advise on modernising
records management within the Public
Service. People from every department
complain constantly about the difficulty
of locating files, about hopeless library
and registrar facilities. (The Public
Service Board library has nothing on
program-budgeting.)
Disband the finished-with
Finally, on a negative note, the
principle should be adopted that agen-
cies should be liquidated when their
work is done. The Snowy Authority is
a case in point. Once the Snowy scheme
is finished the authority should be dis-
banded, since there is no other project
in Australia requiring a similar large
complex organisation. There are a
number of relatively small power and
irrigation schemes in Queensland and
N.S.W., but none requiring the massive
Snowy team, whose engineers and tech-
nicians can profitably be employed by
State authorities and private business.
And the taxpayer relieved of at least
one burden.

“LET ME help you look lovelier!”
June Dally-Watkins’ message to women
of all ages, contained in eight flesh-pink
and white pages, is dominated by a
photograph of Miss Dally-Watkins smil-
ing, chin on hand, with three rows of
pearls round the neck and a whopping
diamond ring on her finger.
Last year she helped, at $5O a time,
800 to 900 Sydney women from 15 years
onward look lovelier; 300 to 400 Bris-
banians; an unspecified number in New
Zealand; and is now attacking the
Manila and Hong Kong markets, from
where she recently returned with the
addition of some extra pounds of un-
lovely weight. Swimming, she says, will
soon get that off.
It is 10 a.m. The June Dally-Wat-

doors into what was a billiard hall.
Piped music. Cream pamt. Parquet

of white flowers and ribbon by the door.
Sad gladioli on a table. A copy of
“Flair” magazine. Orange curtains, steel
stackable chairs, newspaper cuttings,
and pictures pinned on the wall.
A middle-aged pupil in a white
knitted suit is propped against the re-
ception desk, telling the girl behind she
is buying a gold dress, gold shoes, gold
bag, and is having her hair gold-rinsed,
too. Lovely, breathes the girl. Mrs. Nola
Clark, the Students’ Organiser, comes
out from an office, replaces two droopy
gladioli with two fresh ones, makes a
dab at the dust, squares up the copy
of “Flair.”
Miss Dally-Watkins has been unavoid-
ably delayed. Well, she is running late,
then. She won’t be long. She is, in fact,
upstairs having her hair done and 30
minutes later swings through the door,
dazzles everyone with a smile, and in-
quires was there somebody who wanted
her? She wears a black suit and a black-
and-white bow in her newly coiffured
blonde hair. “You see,” she says, “you
weren’t there, so I had my hair done
while I waited for you.”
It is 10.35, and at 11 o’clock a
dozen housewives are due for ward-
robing. They are three-quarters through
the course. They have done What Good
Grooming Is and What It Can Do For
Them (Miss Dally-Watkins’ personal
lecture), Basic Posture, Exercises (Yoga
and Diet), Advanced Posture and De-
portment (walking, standing, and sit-
ting), Make-up (skin care), Hairstyling
(setting and looking after), Mani-
curing and Personal Care (deodorants,
removing hair from legs and underarms,
etc.), and after Wardrobing can look
forward to Posture and Advanced Pos-
ture exercises, Social and Business Eti-
quette, and a graduation ceremony in
front of friends and relatives when their
charm, assurance, poise, and beauty will
at last be visible.
“There is that much glamor to this
business,” says Miss Dally-Watkins,
measuring one eighth of an inch with
white-lacquered nails,” and that much
(nine inches) of sheer hard slog.” The
slog began 17 years ago when she won
the Model of the Year award. Friends
pestered her for advice on what to wear
with what, how to put on make-up, how
should they wear their hair? “But why
do it for nothing?” asked mother Mrs.
Kay James, now the school’s Student
Consultant. “Start a grooming school.”
That was in 1950. From a first class
0 f s j x an( j photographer’s studio, for use
after 5 p.m. only, to this sprawling place
with 30 or so teachers coping with
the increasing demand of ladies seeking
to improve themselves isn’t bad. You’d
think the teachers would up and off to
start schools of their own, wouldn’t
you? It has happened only once, and
now Miss Pat Woodley is her only big
competitor in Sydney. “I was hurt ,”
says Miss Dally-Watkms after deep
thought
However despite the slog it is all
1 e s °& . „
very rewarding. Not only financially,
though even that isn’t so big a reward
as some people might think, what with
overheads and things. No. If it were
just the money she’d be off like a shot;
and, of course, if her family of four
children and husband weren’t getting
sufficient attention she’d think twice
about it all. What Miss Dally-Watkins
enjoys is the transformation that comes
over her pupils when they’ve finished the
course. “You’d be amazed how elegant
they look on graduation day. Something
suddenly happens to them _ I dont
know what—and they look marvellous,
It is then the students receive their
Diploma: a pink-bordered document,
red-sealed with green squiggles, birds,
and flowers everywhere, certifying they
have successfully completed their full
course in grooming.
No one fails the course, but some are
better than others. Even if one was an
absolute horror (Miss Dally-Watkins
does not smile) she would have learnt
something en route. No, she doesn’t re-
turn fees. No one has ever asked for
one thing. For another, the school
would have done their bit, it was up
to the student to do hers.
It is 11.15 and the housewives are
late. A few wander by the door, clasp-
ing shopping baskets and pristine white
gloves. Some bring their children, too.
Well, they make allowances for house-
wives. Mrs. Clark says excuse me, would
we like to go into Wardrobing now?
Miss Dally-Watkins considers and thinks
perhaps they should settle beforehand.
Would Mrs. Clark please warn the
teacher she was coming and tell her not
to take any notice? Pretend she wasn’t
there. Carry on as usual. “Of course,
you’re such an ogre ,” chuckles Mrs.
Clark and disappears.
walk into Wardrobing and every-
one freezes. The teacher, a pretty girl
in a navy blue coat and green spotted
bow in her hair (everyone’s got bows,
they’re Miss Dally-Watkins newest thing
from Manila), tries to recapture the
flow of her lecture. Now, who is Pear-
Shaped? I am, says Miss Dally-Watkins,
and everyone laughs. She receives in-
structions how to disguise this fault.
Who is Too Fat? A late-comer rushes
in, says she is 36-26—er—falters at
hips. Never mind. She’s showing confi-
dence saying that much. Who is too
thin? No one. Top heavy? One is, but
doesn’t say so. Too tall? Lucky girl.
Too short? Miss Dally-Watkins says it
is extraordinary, the average Australian
girl used to be five-foot-three, now she’s
five-foot-four. “Anyway, remember the
formula: Proportion, camouflage, line
and color, to play up your best points
and to hide your worst. Whatever
shape, the formula applies. Now, who’s
wearing pointed toes? A man up the
road turns them into squares for four
dollars. Of course, no one is wearing
white shoes now it’s winter, are they
. . .?”
We withdraw, and Miss Dally-Wat-
kins says she is very glad because the
lecture was going back-to-front. There’s
a student being coached privately in the
studio next door. She is going on to
modelling. The student wiggles proudly,
“You’ve a lovely figure, dear,” mur-
murs Miss Dally-Watkins. Up one floor
to hairdressing, a new extension of the
school, where Miss Dally-Watkins greets
an employee ecstatically. She has lots of
news for her about Manila and Hong
Kong. They inspect each other’s stock-
ings - Miss Dally-Watkins wears tights,
and that reminds her. They’re to get
i n to them downstairs at once, she
noticed too many gaps and suspenders
when they bent down. A hairdresser in
g reen pants-dress says yes she’ll get on
to that.
Downstairs, Mrs. James varnishes her
fingernails. Miss Dally-Watkins’ 12.15
appointment arrives. He’ll go to Lov-
able first, then come back. Mrs. James
stands very close and says the school is
not interested in the girl who comes in
with lots of money and plonks down her
fifty dollars. They want to help the girl
in the factory, she’s the real backbone
of Australia. One employer sent his
secretary to the school and said what
they’d achieved was an inspiration to
everyone.
Ten a.m. next day. A telephone call
to Miss Dally-Watkins. She cannot
speak. She is up in hairdressing. Under
the steam-dryer.
“Babeee luv, babeee luv, woooah
babeee luv . . .” sings the pint-size teen-
ager at Pat Woodley’s Grooming School,

it. What does ten by eight look like?
One girl comes out, a flourish of paisley

thanks, just fine.
The time is 4.15. The Grooming
School is on the eighth floor of a block
on George Street, Sydney. Pat Wood-
ley’s mother, sixtyish, grey-haired, and
wearing specs, in turquoise dress and
pearls is there, checking appointments.
Girls in thigh-high skirts and chalk-
white faces flit in and out. It’s a small,
compact place. Contemporary. Like a
hairdresser’s. Gold embossed plastic
wallpaper, washable. Sea-green and
brown trimmings. Chandeliers. Gold
fake flowers on a pedestal. Blown up
black-and-white pictures of models on
the walls.
Mrs. Woodley says her daughter will
be out soon and on the dot of our 4.30
appointment she appears. A tall, big
girl, all in orange, hair dark and short.
Her message is to the Young Set. “How
to make a boy say Wow! How to get a
terrific new job!—How to look prettier,


be a glamor girl!” Mum has worked
out that 1500 pupils come and go
through the school in a year at $5O or
so a head. “I hope,” says Miss Woodley,
looking amazed and worried “that that
is right.” Anyway, they learn all about
charm from the TOP, because Miss
Woodley was Miss Australia for six
months “. . . meeting world-famous
celebrities, film stars, appearing on
radio and television . . .” so that’s all
right.
Pat Woodley’s school is 15 years old.
She celebrated the birthday this year
with a champagne breakfast and got
very good Press coverage. Her personal
story is all there in the slick brown-
and-white brochure she sends to new
applicants for the course. Written by an
advertising agency in a mushy style
that Miss Woodley calls friendly and
warm. Anyway, she won an art scholar-
ship and a scholarship to the Teachers’
College all in the same year, plumped
for teaching, and in 1950 when she was
20 won the Miss Australia competition.
It is nearly five o’clock, and goodness
the interruptions. Miss Woodley waves
her arms up there, behind her executive
desk with its red Chinese lamp and
matching leather accessories, snatches
up the telephone, and speaks to a girl
she can see two yards away in reception.
Sorry about that. Yes, well, if there did
seem more models there that day (the
other side to her school) it was coinci-
dence. Grooming classes for housewives,
teenagers, wives of up-and-coming
executives, you know, went on all day.
At six o’clock we will sit in on the Eti-
quette lesson for teenagers.
Meanwhile, Miss Woodley agrees that
what she teaches at the school could
just as easily be learnt from magazines,
women’s sections of newspapers, and so
on —but, BUT here there is incentive
to keep at it, what with teachers and
other pupils and, yes, parting with $5O
helps, too. Mind you, there are prob-
lems. It would be only too easy to send
out a lot of little Pat Woodleys into
Sydney’s streets, but this is the one thing
she definitely does not do. “This is a
very personal service. Each lass is given
individual advice, and each one gets
value for money. It is terribly impor-
tant to make them feel they are getting
that.” How? Well, she keeps classes
small and—let’s put it another way:
would anyone get their money back if
they were dissatisfied? No. Miss Wood-
ley knew the school had done its best,
anyone who felt dissatisfaction simply
hadn’t tried hard enough.
The school runs seven courses: (1)
Career-Girl, 14 two-hour lessons cover-
ing everything from facial and figure
analysis to voice modulation for $52.
(2) Concentrated: Same as above, all
day, every day for one exciting week.
(3) Private: For quick, concentrated
transformation . . . for your wedding,
perhaps . . . lessons $lO each, motel
accommodation for country girls at re-
duced rates. (4) Photographic: Every-
thing that “makes a good model.” It’s
a rare honor to be chosen for this, costs
$4O for ten lessons. (5) Teenage: As in
Career-Girl, with accent on youth, 14
two-hour lessons $52. (6) Preparation
in Living: children four to seven years,
$3O for ten lessons. Grooming to eti-
quette, art and music appreciation. (7)
Executive Wives and Home-Makers:
14-week midday course to make you a
charming companion, $52.
Candidates for Preparation in Liv-
ing are seasonal. Winter is a dead time
for unlivable-with kiddies. Spring and
summer, business looks up. They are
taught how to do things like clean teeth
properly, brush their hair, how to walk.
“We turn it into a marvellous game:
For example, pretend they are spending
the day at the Zoo. They discuss the
animals they’ll see, they get dressed for
their trip, have lunch, the little boys
helping the little girls to food and their
teacher, Sandra Russell (a former Miss
Personality, which means she’s got
brains as well), watching table manners,
making sure little boys open doors for
little girls and allow them to pass
through first.”
Miss Woodley is thrilled by her work
in this course. She mentions the small
boy who, for the first two lessons,
refused to come out from underneath
the table. On the third he said he didn’t
care who saw him there. Yes, you would
think they’d learn all this at home or
school: Miss Woodley says it is very
strange, children often don’t respond
to parents, but they respond to her.
A girl with eyes made up like the
lead in the “Mikado,” all black
furrows down her nose, sticks her head
round the door. “Hi. Just wanted to
say ’bye.” Now that one, says Miss
Woodley, has an uncanny knack of
knowing what’s coming next in fashion
before it even happens. But those eyes.
Yes, well, they may look strange, but
she’s got this knack of knowing, you
see. But what she wants to add is that,
of all courses, the women most sus-
ceptible to suggestion were those who
came for Executive Wives and Home-
Maker.
The brochure asks: “ARE YOU GO-
ING TO BE A HELP OR A HIND-
RANCE IN YOUR HUSBAND’S
CAREER? It’s a frank question, and
every woman who loves and admires
her husband should answer it honestly.
If you have any doubts, it would be
wise to talk the problem over with
Miss Woodley.”
Having decided she is a hindrance,
the school takes over. But even then
some wives are nervous in case hus-
bands notice they are changing. It
seems a vicious circle, but Miss Wood-
ley has an answer. She teaches, for in-
stance, how to apply make-up so that it
doesn’t show, adding for good meas-
ure advice not to apply it where their
husbands can see them. Eventually, the
hindrance becomes a perfect hostess
and welcome guest; she can also “go to
the plushiest restaurants, and the poshest
places, meet the most famous people
with never a fear of saying or doing
the wrong thing.” And then, like other
students, she graduates.
This is a deadly serious occasion
Sometimes relatives and friends are as
nervous as the girls. Anyway, 80 to 100
people turn up on average for the three
or four weekly graduations to see the
New You walk down the dais to music
in (1) sportswear (2) day wear and (3)
evening wear. After which they pose
for pictures, purchasable at 50 cents
each, and are presented with Miss
Woodley’s diploma: an off-white scroll
signed by her in brown ink to match
the lettering, tied with white satin
ribbon, and through which she sticks a
red carnation. No, she does not serve
champagne at graduations. She will,
however, when she opens at Newcastle,
shortly. Her sister Claudette is up there
now arranging it all.
It is six o’clock. The teacher for Eti-
quette arrives. Elizabeth Stranger. In
bright pink, a color she can’t seem to
stop wearing. In fact, the more she tries
the harder it becomes. Isn’t it silly? Mrs.
Stranger hasn’t taken this Etiquette
class before, she hopes she’ll be all right.
‘‘Of course you will,” says Miss Wood-
ley sternly. Well, you know what it’s
like, they don’t always relax if they’re
not used to you. Anyway, see you up
there, soon? Lovely.
First a quick tour of the school. Mir-
rors everywhere. Arc lamps. Studio
paraphernalia. Make-up room. Girls
silently sticking on false eyelashes. Ad-
miring results. Smiling. Narcissistic. We
go up in a lift. Here’s Mrs. Stranger
surrounded by nine teenagers and one
trainee-teacher. A coffee-table laden
with full dinner setting, flowers and
all, at her knees, . . and when did
you last smile first?” she asks. “Smile.
Walk along the street and smile at
people. You’ll find they’ll smile back at
you. Oh—pick your person, of course.”
Tremulous giggle round the group.
They look shyly down at notebooks
and pencils. Have you, asks Miss Wood-
ley, done Opinions yet? Indeed, yes.
Mrs. Stranger has been trying to get
them off TV and take their binoculars
to the theatre, which only costs 67 cents.
Who didn’t like “Funny Girl?” Oh, it
was you. You didn’t think there was a
story to it? That’s right. We were say-
ing there should be more support for
Jill Perryman. Yes, we got some good
opinions, didn’t we? The important
thing is they should be your own, and
you shouldn’t just repeat other people’s
opinions. “But what if you agree with
them?” asks the blonde who didn’t like
“Funny Girl.” Yes. Ah, well. On with
Introductions. “An introduction is
necessary to place two strange people
on friendly terms . . .”
. . . Miss Woodley says she’s putting a
pink awning up there for a bit of color.
There’s a lot more to be done to the
decor. Meanwhile, she doesn’t think
she’ll come in this Saturday. She is
due for a nice, long rest in bed . • •

OVERSEAS
Jordan: THE NEW EXODUS
BY GAVIN YOUNG
JORDAN IS A COUNTRY enduring
a nightmare of such proportions that
anyone who comes here now must find
himself partially sharing it. Its popu-
lation has been emotionally and
physically shattered. King Hussein
leading his delegation to the United
Nations deserves to be heard with
immense respect. He has made Homeric
sacrifices for the Arab cause in a war
he did not want. His prestige is at its
height. Above all, in disaster, he is
unhysterical.
Anyone who wants to see what the
war has meant in human suffering
should come here. Jordan lost far more
than Egypt or Syria. It is infinitely more
tragic to lose the populated west bank
of Jerusalem than to lose the wastes of
Sinai.
Egypt’s civilian population has not
been much affected. Jordan’s civilians
were caught, panic-stricken, in the war.
The bitter complaints I heard in
Lebanon that the war had emptied the
tourist hotels seem almost indecent from
here. In Jordan thousands have been
made destitute. There are soldiers in
hospital shrivelled with napalm.
Jordan’s plight is desolating: for its
people today the future is a hopeless
riddle.
It seems unbelievable that one cannot
drive any more from Amman down the
new highway to Jerusalem, though the
sad, effusive hotel brochures still say
you can. All else aside, Amman with its
overcrowded streets of aimless, ambling,
west-bank refugees is claustrophobic. It
will be more so.
The refugees are still coming. Two
weeks after the ceasefire I stood on the
bank of the Jordan and watched them
scrambling across the twisted girders of
the Allenby Bridge. An old, heavy
woman was carried over, her feet
wrapped in rags soaked with blood.
There were very old men in dusty suits
clutching battered suitcases; others, in
sweat-soaked shirts, who might have
been their sons, humping mattresses and
possessions in bulging blankets. There
were children of all ages and howling
babies in arms. Two hundred must have
crossed in half an hour while I was
there.
Some of their relatives tensely waiting
on the Jordan side thrust forward when
they saw me, to ask angrily: “When are
they going back? One month, two
months? Tell us!” Today there is no
answer. Many of these fugitives are new
refugees, not from camps but land and
homes in Ramallah, Nablus, and Jenin.
Across the river, Israeli soldiers in
battledress, sub-machine-guns slung,
laughed and talked, seated on wicker
chairs, and watched Arabs crossing.
Is the exodus deliberately encouraged
by the Israelis? I have met no
Jordanian who does not think so. They
believe the Israelis want to settle a
million more Jewish migrants on the
west bank. A senior and moderate-
minded Jordanian officer said: “They
are using a different tactic today. In
1947 and 1948 they used terrorism to
clear out the Arabs. This time they are
giving them transport to Amman.”
In Amman, an English-speaking
Palestinian schoolteacher said: “The
Israeli soldiers knocked at our door
and told us to leave. They gave no
reason. They put us into trucks. They
said: ‘Now go to Hussein, go to Nasser.’
They took all the young men away.”
We talked, squatting on the floor of
a small schoolroom he is sharing with
17 other Palestinians. He and they will
be transferred, in time, to a new camp.
Some refugees have feet terribly torn
from the long walk in the heat. Some
are enraged: “The British and Ameri-
cans helped the Jews. The damned Jews
couldn’t do this alone.”
There is no work for them in this
overcrowded place. They cannot go
back, the Israelis will not let them.
Families are divided and without news
of relatives caught up in the fighting
areas. If they try to get a letter through,
they are told they must put “State of
Israel” after the west-bank address on
the envelope, the last straw of humilia-
tion.
One thing is certain: Jordan was
desperately keen that this war should
not take place. Jordan is pathetically
vulnerable. Under moderate and real-
istic leaders, the economy was at last
making headway. Instead, as Nasser and
the Syrians made their brinkmanship
moves, King Hussein was left no choice
of action. His flight to meet Nasser on
the eve of war and the defence pact
were politically essential if he was to
risk a revolution as a “traitor” to the
Arab cause in the fiery atmosphere en-
gendered by Cairo, Damascus, and the
Palestinian leader, Ahmed Shukhairy.
Jordan’s tragedy is that it cannot
always, between headstrong neighbors,
pursue the course it prefers.
The Jordanian Army was not in an
attacking posture but a defensive one.
Senior officers with families on the
frontier had not even advised them to
leave for Amman, which they surely
would have done if Jordan planned an
attack. King Hussein believed the
Egyptians would 'give him massive air
cover if war came; he is bitter that he
was misled.
When war came most of the
Jordanian Army was destroyed by air
strikes.
In Amman’s military hospital this
The wrecked Allenby Bridge on Jordan River ... heartbreak crossing


week I saw soldiers horribly burnt with
what must, it seems to me, have been
napalm. They had not been “brewed
up” in tanks; they were infantrymen
caught in their trenches by Israeli jets.
One or two whose faces were not a mask
of burnt flesh spoke of “wave after
wave” of planes. They described bombs
spewing flame over large areas. No one
knows here how many men were lost.
Many dead and wounded had to be
abandoned. But the loss in planes and
tanks and trucks was very high. Who
will replace them, people are asking—
and how will Jordan pay?
The economic effect of the catas-
trophe is probably incalculable. Un-
employment stood at about 12 percent
before the war; now with the new in-
flux of refugees no one can tell v\hat
it may be.
Jordan’s development had been doing
well. But it was geared largely to irri-
gation schemes on the west bank, potash
from the Dead Sea area, and tourism,
which would have brought in As 64
million in 1970 the way things w r ere
going. All that has gone.
Those who had sold on credit to
compatriots in Jerusalem today clutched
fistfuls of useless bills. Contractors have
lost a fortune in heavy equipment con-
fiscated by the Israelis, west-bank
smallholders and farmers, who are, left
with wdiat they stand up in, are de-
manding to know who will compen-
sate them.
There is great bitterness at Britain’s
“abandonment” of a traditional friend,
but relations have not been broken off.
America is even more unpopular. At a
Press conference before he left for the
UN to make his demand for condemna-
tion of Israeli “aggression” and imme-
diate, unconditional withdrawal of
Israeli troops from Arab territory, King
Hussein admitted he was not entirely
convinced by the evidence that British
and American planes intervened in the
war. But it is very widely accepted that
there was some sort of collusion.
Fortunately, Jordanians are the least
hysterical of Arabs. They are aware
that if Israel is their foremost enemy,
they have others close at hand. They
will need friends now.
Jordanians are conscious of the fact
that they have suffered most. They are
aware that it is Jordan, not Egypt or
Syria, that has succored the bulk of
the destitute refugee population all
these years, and has integrated the
Palestinian elite into the administration
as its neighbors have not done.
Mr. George Brown’s statement that
Israel cannot expect to hold Jerusalem
brought some minimal relief here; Jor-
danians would have preferred to have
heard him include the rest of the west
bank. It is too early to know if Jordan
would accept internationalisation. Above
all, it is clear that King Hussein will
not sit down to talks with the Israelis.
It is equally clear that, trapped into
a war it did not want by irresistible
gales of Arab-Israeli enmity, Jordan is
in urgent need of international rescue.
And it seems inconceivable that the
tattered, frightened columns of the
homeless most of them refuges twice
over —are to be doomed to subsistence
living for more than a few weeks at
most in the arid camps of the east bank.
Israel
Righteous victors
ISRAELIS, DRUNK AT FIRST on
military victory, release from fear and
the regaining of Jerusalem, are now
beginning to experience a hangover
from new headaches: in the phrase of
their Foreign Minister, Mr. Abba Eban,
“There is a conflict between Israel’s
demographic and territorial interests.”
Meantime strenuous efforts are being
made to restore normal life in the newly
conquered territories. Electricity, water,
food, police, postal, and other services
are running again there, and something
is being done to lessen the inevitable
suffering of war. The stream of Arab
refugees crossing the Jordan to silent
relatives massed on the eastern bank is
not discouraged. But occasionally
Israeli soldiers stop to carry children
to the bridge and give them water, say-
ing “this is not what we fought for.”
The refugee camp at Jericho is now
deserted. The new refugee figure is
estimated in Jerusalem at 150,000, out
of a west-bank population of around
900,000. In contrast, a stream of people
who fled Jerusalem for the hills is
now returning to the old city.
Mingling with this convulsion, amid
the dangers of animosity and un-
surrendered arms, Israelis are jaunting
up and down the west bank, noting its
scenic similarity to Israel and never
tiring of trying to communicate on a
non-political level with its Arab popu-
lation. Israelis display a strong feeling
of belonging, and none of guilt: they
have the righteousness of revolution-
aries, not conquerors, who feel they
were compelled into using force and
know that if the result had been re-
versed the Arabs now displaying white
flags would have been pitiless.
There is a general feeling, too, that
East-West or United Nations man-
oeuvres cannot alter the new facts of
life if Israel stands firm and knows
what it wants. The Government, natur-
ally, is more susceptible to world pres-
sures. Some officials now hold that
Russia’s clamor is designed not merely
to save its face but as cover for a new
penetration of the Middle East based
on the weakness of the present Arab
rulers. The familiar Israeli thesis that
no Middle East peace is possible with-
out accord between the two super-
powers is now linked with a universal
belief that Russia is in a position to call
the Arabs off Israel, but will not do so
Israeli-occupied. Jordan ... orthodox
Jews visiting the tomb of Abraham
as long as it wants a foothold in the
region.
But the crux now, as on the eve of
war, is not what the powers do but
how Israel itself tackles the staggering
problems presented by the unforeseen
scope of its victory.
Only those concerned with economic
planning have even begun to glimpse
the enormous financial burden involved
in the acquisition of 800,000 Arabs now
entirely cut off from their normal
sources of foreign trade.
The biggest headaches are still to
come. Tb Israelis will find it has been
much ea rto conquer the west bank
than to absorb it if this, indeed, is
their intention. But so far nobody in
Israel from the Prime Minister
down—appears to know what Israel’s
policy should be —apart from last week’s
defiant annexation of Jerusalem.
Under the stress of intolerable dilem-
mas, old cracks are reappearing in
Israel’s political fabric. General Dayan,
the Defence Minister, has hinted he may
walk out, presumably because the Prime
Minister, Mr. Eshkol, is disinclined to
move over for him. If he goes, others
will follow. All are agreed about keep-
ing Jerusalem, but there is silence and
confusion about other territories. A
small popular movement is demanding
that nothing be returned. But despite
its oil and mineral riches Israel does
not want the Sinai Desert, or even all

Mr. Don got into office furniture quite by
accident. He wanted a comfortable chair.
So he designed his own. No sooner was
it made than it was sold out from under
him. He made another, and another, and
another. He was forced to put up a new
factory just to build his favourite chair.
Then he started on other chairs, and
desks. Before he knew it he was selling
office furniture all over the place. Which
brings us to the point. Don’s office furni-
ture is functionally comfortable. Good
looking too. And the prices surprisingly
low. Take Mr. Don’s favourite chair for
instance it sells for only $135. An
executive bargain!

The Arabs
Sticking together
NO ARAB REGIME or leader looks
like falling at present as the result of
the Arabs’ defeat by Israel. It may be
that the horrors of the war, the terrible
toll of young life in the Egyptian and
Jordanian armies, the loss of territory,
the plight of the refugees and the
wounded have not yet penetrated fully
to their capital cities though Amman
knows enough of grief. And yet the
aftermath has a quite different quality
from the bitterness that followed the
Arab-Israeli War of 1948.
Then three regimes collapsed and
several leaders were assassinated be-
cause they were believed to have be-
trayed the Arab cause. Today there is
no talk of betrayal. All countries are
believed to have acquitted themselves
as well as could be expected. All the
leaders are still convincing themselves
that the betrayal came from outside
that is, from the United States, which,
they say, encouraged Israel to attack
while preventing President Nasser from
doing so. Arab unity has thereby been
preserved.
President Nasser is taking the lead in
The Arab Foreign Ministers ... problems with or without unity
trying to bury all the old inter-Arab
conflicts and give a life-or-death
urgency to the future of the Arab cause.
He has called for a general reconcilia-
tion. The presence of Tunisia’s Mr.
Mongi Slim in Saudi Arabia has been
interpreted as a sign that negotiations
between President Nasser and King
Faisal are under way. A settlement now
seems possible, since Egypt can scarcely
continue to keep troops in Yemen, and
King Faisal is believed to be under local
pressure not to make his terms for
peace in Yemen too stiff. But he is said
to be insisting that the former King
Saud leaves Cairo.
The doctrinaire Syrians are more
likely to cling to their antagonism to
King Hussein. But absolutely no one
follows them in this, and they risk
isolation if they persist.
In Cairo President Nasser is back
with a popular mandate, and no one
has questioned his taking full powers
to himself by becoming Prime Minister
and Secretary-General of the Arab
Socialist Union as well as being Presi-
dent. This again needs some explaining,
since, by western lights, he would seem
more responsible than anyone for what
the Arabs call their “setback.” But
Arabs set much store by legalities.
Nasser’s case for blockading the Gulf
of Aqaba is considered to have been
legally sound. His only mistake is felt
to have been allowing Israel the first
blow. That this was a vital and terrible
mistake (after virtually daring the
Israelis to fight him) is ignored be-
cause he is the one person still able to
rally the Arabs. The spontaneous
demonstrations that forced him to with-
draw his resignation can be explained
only as an endorsement of what Nasser
supremely stands for in Arab eyes: de-
fiance. In effect, he was being asked
but by people still without a concep-
tion of how dreadful their “setback”
has been to go on with the struggle
rather than accept defeat.
In Damascus, too, little has changed.
The feeling is that anyone who attacks
the regime now would be serving Israel;
nothing is less likely than another coup.

the Syrians will form a spearhead of
belligerency at the Arab summit con-
ference when it comes about.
The Arab Foreign Ministers’ confer-
ence began in Kuwait and continued in
New York between United Nations’
sessions. Draft plans for future action
submitted by Sudan, Kuwait and Syria
and the Palestine Liberation Organisa-
tion showed no important differences.
Agreement on principles will not be
hard to reach; but the exact form of
implementation of an economic boycott
and oil shutoff presents formidable prob-
lems hard to solve with or without Arab
unity. One reform that all the Foreign
Ministers agreed about is the need for a
more intelligent presentation of the Arab
case to the world. The Arabs now realise
that they wrecked their case internation-
ally by appearing to say that they were
going to “annihilate” Israel. They blame
faulty translations. What precisely some
said in Arabic was “remove as a politi-
cal entity.” But the damage was well
and truly done.
The date for a summit conference
may not be fixed until some under-
standing is reached between President
Nasser and King Faisal, and the present
General Assembly session ends. Many
Arab observers are pessimistic about ob-
taining a two-thirds majority condemn-
ing Israel as an aggressor. They expect
Israel to refuse to withdraw from occu-
pied areas and that this will be the
state of affairs that their summit con-
ference will have to discuss. But time is
running out, and King Hussein, with
Jerusalem and half his territory lost, has
announced that he will take unilateral
action if the conference is not called
soon.

India and China
A bombshell
PREDICTABLY, INDIAN OPINION
has reacted sharply to the latest demon-
stration of Chinese nuclear capability.
In Parliament, in New Delhi, members
(including many from the ruling Con-
gress Party) tried several times after the
China bombshell to get the Prime
Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, to define her
Government’s response to the growing
threat, but she fobbed them off with
ambiguous generalisations. This was un-
avoidable; India has yet to decide what
it really wants to do.
Only a small Right-wing minority has
previously wanted to imitate Japan m
seeking safety under a western nuclear
umbrella, but even their views are likely
to be swayed by Japan’s open unease
last week about the Red H-bomb. A
guarantee to India under joint East-

acceptable, but nothing of the kind is

on offer. The feeling has in fact grown
that even if Washington and Moscow
brought themselves to offer one, it
would not be of a kind that could be
made to stick.
Not surprisingly, India’s vocal pro-
bomb lobby has gained greatly in
strength since China staged its hydrogen
blast. A rising tide of emotion is obscur-
ing the issue of costs, both political and
economic, the assumption being that it
is grossly unpatriotic to worry about
solvency when the nation’s security is
imperilled. In the top echelons of Gov-
ernment a few (among them Mr.
Morarji Desai, the Deputy Prime
Minister) are firm and positive in their
opposition to bomb making, while most
In Bombay ... anti-Mao demonstrators.
Now there’s the bigger, nuclear fear
others would favor a solution that
allows India to go ahead with prepara-
tions without a commitment to a
specific weapons program.
This largely explains New Delhi’s
opposition to any non-proliferation
treaty that would forbid “peaceful ex-
plosions.” By and large the military
establishment endorses this majority
view. It is argued that India must do
all it can to keep the technological lead
gained by China from widening any
further, even if this means that the right
to make the bomb must for the present
be defended.
In all the arguments now taking
place, one important facet is altogether
missing. There is no attempt, official
or unofficial, to formulate a long-term
policy toward China. The voices that
were being raised a year ago urging
an attempt to achieve a modus vivendi
in regard to the disputed Sino-Indian
borders have been stilled, first by
China’s involvement with Pakistan and
latterly by the militancy of Mao’s
cultural revolutionaries. The ugly inci-
dents of the past few weeks involving
embassy personnel in both New Delhi
and Peking very nearly led to the break-
ing off of diplomatic relations. Though
this was fortunately averted at the last
minu e, it is noteworthy how few
people here assign any value at all to
the maintenance of a formal link.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The Trust presents its accounts
By MICHAEL BAUME
THERE IS A simple reason why the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust suffered yet
another deficit last year bad debts.
And even though the Trust does not
reveal what these bad debts are all
about in last week’s annual report and
accounts a strangely uninformative
document in the circumstances it is
a fair guess that the ill-fated and ill-
conceived Festival of Asia brought
about these losses. Or if it was not the
Festival, what on earth was it?
“This investment is not recom-
mended. Apart from the company’s
remarkable ability to lose money, its
accounts and reports are so uninforma-
tive that a reasonable evaluation of its
worth is not possible.” This is the sort
of conclusion a security analyst would
come to after looking through the
accounts, which were presented to the
public almost six months after the end
of the year they covered.
Once again the Trust has reported
a deficit and a fall in its accumulated
funds. The latest deficit of $33,582 is
larger than the previous year’s $27,480
but less than half the size of the 1964
loss of $155,108. And if it had not been
for bad debts, the Trust would have
broken even for the year. It wrote off
$40,000 in doubtful debts before reach-
ing its deficit.
The Trust seems a strange organisa-
tion to end up with such large bad
debts in view of the generally small
way it lends money. The Chairman
gives no reason for the extra provision
of $40,000 made this year for doubt-
ful debts to add to the previous year’s
provision of $12,000.
And all these provisions are not
simply for the sake of caution
$32,224 has actually been lost in bad
debts without any word of explanation,
beyond the Chairman saying that the
present provision “should be adequate
to cover any further losses in this re-
gard.” If that amount of money had
not been lost, the Trust’s loans to the
Australian Ballet and its grant to the
National Institute of Dramatic Art
could have doubled or its total of
grants could have gone up by more
than half.
The provisions for bad debts made
over the past two years totalling
$52,000 are larger than all the
advances the Trust has made during
the past two years.
If the Trust lost more money last
year it is telling its members and the
public less about it. In the previous
year’s report, there was a list of gross
revenue and expenditure according to
each section of the Trust’s activities,
ballet, opera, drama, and so on. This
year it is not there. There are some
tables and figures, but they are so
designed that you cannot compare
details of the 1966 result with the year
before.
The accounts do show how the
Trust spent the money it received.
They show (for those prepared to do
the sums themselves) that 53 percent
of the Trust’s non-box-office income
went in subsidies to its own or associ-
ated activities, 64 percent went in
grants to help smaller theatre groups,
six percent went toward covering the
losses the Trust made on productions,
4.7 percent went to meet the costs of
operating the production division, 4.4
percent went in doubtful debts, and
“overhead expenses” took a quarter of
its total non-box-office income.
The higher deficit was despite an
$BO,OOO increase in Governmental sub-
sidies brought into the accounts. These
subsidies now total $780,500, to pro-
Spending money on the
arts is a difficult thing. You have
to learn step by step
Dr. H. C. Coombs, Chairman of the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust, last week
vide all but a fraction of the total
non-box-office income of $870,000.
The Australian Ballet increased its
income by $200,000-odd to $470,000
and the Opera Company began func-
tioning again after the hiatus of the
Sutherland season, so that its income
rose from $36,000 to $230,000. But
drama income dropped by $60,000 or
more than 20 percent to $215,000.
Ballet required a $200,285 subsidy
to add to its $470,000 box office re-
ceipts. Opera’s total box office was
$230,000 and it was subsidised by
$126,700. In the previous year drama
box-office receipts were about $275,000
and the drama subsidy only $70,459,
or about 20 percent of the amount
needed to finance it.
But last year drama cost the Trust
$105,374, an increase of 50 percent,
while box-office totalled only $215,000.
The Athens Drama Company lost
$37,294, the interstate tour of “Private
Yuk Objects,” $13,302, and the Inter-
state Theatre Season, $31,089. To
pay for these follies, the South Aus-
tralia Theatre Company, established by
the Trust with a great deal of fuss
the year before, had its subsidy cut
from $16,910 to a miniscule $6274.
The movements in debtors and
creditors are quite disturbing, indicat-
ing the Trust is in a worsening liquid
state with creditors to whom the Trust
owes money increasing sharply by an
unexplained $33,000 to $121,000 while
fewer debtors owe money to the Trust.
These have fallen by an equally un-
explained $40,000 to $120,000.
It would have been nice for the
Chairman to explain to members just
what the new expenditure item of
$13,886 on “promotions” was all about.
One of these unexplained promotions
is listed as “membership” and cost
$11,363. But if, as it seems, this was
aimed at getting extra members it did
not do too well; subscriptions from
members rose by barely $l5OO.
But if the Trust does not do too well
as a theatrical operator, its success as
an investor cannot be denied. Even
though the accumulated funds available
to the Trust for its theatrical activities
have been falling for the past four
years, it has been adding to its invest-
ments in each of those years. It has
spent $119,607 buying company shares
and debentures,
and these had
risen in price to
be worth $158,604
last December
and should be
worth a bit more
by now, since the
stock market has
risen.
But these shares
are not earning much; the average in-
come from them is only 4.4 percent of
their cost. (Although the mysterious
and unexplained investment of $13,000
in “other company” has suddenly
become very profitable, with a $3OOO
dividend representing a 23 percent
earning rate on this investment.)
But at the same time the Trust had
this investment worth $158,604 earn-
ing a meagre $7900 in income, it was
paying out $24,800 in interest on the
money it had borrowed during the
year the bank overdraft of $337,000.
This interest bill, by the way, had
jumped by $lO,OOO without explana-
tion, although the Trust’s liabilities at
balance date had not moved enough to
justify anything like that sort of in-
crease. So they were an interesting set
of accounts; interesting for what they
failed to say, rather than what they
actually said. They will not win the
Australian Institute of Management’s
annual report award.


Compatibility
By JOHN CARGHER
EMI IN ENGLAND, the world’s
largest recording organisation, has
announced that from July 1 it has dis-
continued the manufacture of monaural
long-playing records of classical music.
In future such discs will be available on
stereo only. This surprise move brings
further confusion to the most thoroughly
undocumented position of the so-called
“compatible” recording, a system which
is supposedly playable as fully fledged
stereo on the most modern machines,
while at the same time giving good
mono reproduction on existing radio-
grams. Today only a few portable
record players, made mainly to play
455, are not automatically fitted with
stereo pick-ups even though many make
no attempt at offering stereo repro-
duction. They are thus leading the
way in the direction envisaged by EMI
—toward the elimination of monaural
discs entirely.
Unfortunately, the fact must be faced
that not thousands but millions of non-
stereo radiograms exist in homes
throughout the world and that record
companies are reluctant to lose this
profitable outlet. Mono discs can be
played without trouble on stereograms,
but the reverse does not apply. The
answer, according to most European
and some American record companies,
is the “compatible” record. However,
the stereo discs which EMI in England
and Australia will issue will not be
compatible and owners of mono players
will have to do without the discs they
want or, short of buying a completely
new outfit, have their machine fitted
with a stereo pick-up which will enable
them to play stereo discs, though they
will sound no different from mono,
i.e., a choice between spending ten to
twenty dollars for no improvement in
sound at all, or scrapping a formerly
valuable machine at considerable loss.
To be truly “compatible” a disc
should lose no quality at all when
played on first-class stereophonic equip-
ment. If this were possible, manufac-
turers, retailers, and the public alike
would heave an enormous sigh of relief.
Unfortunately, the picture is getting
more cloudy instead of clearer with
each conflicting announcement.
The difference between mono and
stereo records lies not in the stylus
used, a common erroneous impression,
but in the ability of the pick-up cart-
ridge to move freely in different direc-
tions. On a mono disc the stylus moves
from side to side only; in the case of
stereo recording there is additional
movement up and down. Since mono
pick-ups are not designed to allow for
this vertical movement, a stereo groove
in contact with a stylus fitted in a
mono head will produce substantial
friction when it tries to lift the playing
head upward, as it is bound to do
sooner or later.
We are told that “compatible” discs
overcome this by having the bass in-
struments placed in a central position
during recording. This reduces the up
and down movement of the groove to
a minimum but, while reducing the con-
flict between groove and pick-up, it
does not eliminate it. Furthermore, it
is ridiculous to arrange orchestras and
artists regardless of artistic considera-
tions purely for the purpose of obtain-
ing a disc suitable for two kinds of
players. Careful listening to the
very best of the compatibles has, in my
case, produced no audible indication
that this rearrangement of instruments
was, in fact, made.
The strongest argument against the
new hybrid comes indirectly from the
heads of record companies, who are not
allowed to call their competitors’ spade
a shovel. Decca’s Arthur Haddy and
EMl’s Dr. G. F. Dutton both politely
refuse to have anything to do with
“compatibles.” Since these gentlemen
between them control the major part
of the world market, their opinion pre-
sumably carries some weight, though
subsidiaries of both companies are
churning out the new discs. They are
taking the view that losses on the sale
of mono discs will be offset by reduced
production expenses and, with the writ-
ing so clearly on the wall at last, that
increased sales of stereograms will pro-
duce more profit still.
On the practical side, record buyers
are rapidly getting more and more con-
fused. The quality of compatibles com-
ing from Germany, for example, is
exceptionally high, yet any sane person
must wonder at the reasoning of
Deutsche Grammophon, who issue discs
marked “STEREO auch MONO
abspielbar” and then also market the
same discs under different numbers as
“MONO”. If the former is playable on
mono, what is the latter for?
The fact of the matter is that any
stereo disc can be played on a mono
machine provided that it is fitted with
a lightweight pick-up and has an
unworn, preferably diamond, stylus. In
the case of a genuine “hi-fi” set little or
no damage will appear for a very long
time. On a commercial radiogram the
quality of reproduction is poor enough
to make a little distortion and minor
wear of the grooves unnoticeable. There
will, of course, be more than the usual
run of tracking troubles, jumping of
grooves, etc., but the general public
seems to take this in its stride. How else
can one explain the continued manu-
facture of sapphire styli and their fitting
to new stereograms? A worn sapphire
can ruin a mono disc in one playing;
the risk is astronomically higher with
stereo or compatible records. In days to
come the fitting of diamond styli to new
machines may become a matter of
course, as it should have been all along.
This, combined with the new light-
weight pick-ups, may well cause the
acceptance of the compatibles by the
public. The serious music-lover will con-
tinue to seek his finer pleasures in true
stereo.

WHY ARE POTS and their ceramic

but they are hardly treated with the
seriousness given to painting or sculp-

of taste? Do they tell more about their
owners than their creators? Oscar
Wilde thought so and, when his blue

could live up to it; and Charles Lamb-
used his old china to deliver a gracious
homily on getting our lives into per-
spective.
In recent years some pots, under the
impact of action-painting and a fresh
look at the baroque, have undergone
violent transformations, but most have
stayed so discreetly within tradition that
they seem aesthetically neutral.
However, Shigeya Iwabuchi, a
Japanese potter, clearly shows how a
tradition, not slavishly plagiarised, can
be a source of inventive renewal; in
comparison, Les Blakebrough, in apply-
ing varied approaches to orthodox
shapes, looks academic, as though he
knows only too well where he is going.
Almost all Iwabuchi’s pieces look like
a fresh personal experience. His large
shiny jars of the darkest green have
trembling lips, thin and delicate in

antithesis to the stalwart rotundity; the
large jars, glowing in Tenmoku glaze
of purple-black on ruddy fawn, have
coppery leaf forms, sometimes like
subtle smudges wafted up from the
darkness as though sombre sheen were
their natural habitat. In one large and
magnificent platter ($590) the red,
brown, and silver flowers are involved
so intrinsically that they cannot be
thought of as decoration. The “decora-
tion” of the platter and its creation
are one and the same process.
The aesthetic of large, simple, shiny,
bulbous pots depends upon compact-
ness and the sharp silhouette; they
meet the air around them in a
crisp encounter, for they are the pots
of a positive presence that is pervasive
to the outer edge. The effect is quite
different when Iwabuchi glazes equally
rotund jars with soft, matt, fawn glazes
or, in the blossom jars, with a powdery,
green, matt glaze that looks at the
edges like a dense, green mist. The
silhouette is there, of course, but there
is no sense of finality in demarcation
from the background, and the light, in-
stead of defining the contours, fluctuates
over the quite beautiful surfaces un-
impeded by decoration. In the soft
fawn jars the surfaces look so tender
that they almost deny their robust
forms, which assert their presence by
showing through the fawn in the
original dark brown of the clay by the
Batsuro wax-resist process that makes
the decoration of foliage and callig-
raphy appear to be incised.
There are other splendid pieces that
raise other issues: pots with a salt ash
glaze, and crunchy surface look a little
archaeological; a fine jug has a way-
ward body but most proper lip and
handle, and the joins of a five-sided
blossom jar are subtly scooped; but
some of his large, thick platters drip-
ping with action-paint show that East
and West can have uneasy encounters.
Iwabuchi shows 80 pieces and Blake-
brough 210; such large numbers must
continue while pottery is regarded as
an artifact and not an art. Blakebrough,
too, has some fine dark pieces, using
iron glazes on jugs and a dusty brown
ochre in six dinner plates in Mittagong
Rock, but he has little of Iwabuchi’s
tense, actual or implied, asymmetry; he
does trail criss-crossing irregular lines
across large platters, but the asymmetry
and waywardness lack an inner necessity
what Hopkins called “inscape”
and this tends to render inert his huge,
opulent shiny pots with irrelevantly
decorative stoppers, and his chests or
boxes, though there is one remarkable
exception among the latter when four
handles loop together in the centre of
the lid and the greys are subtly varied
for each side.
Compared with Iwabuchi (it should
go without saying that compared with
Australians Blakebrough is an outstand-
ing potter), Blakebrough’s decoration is
predictable and perfunctory, but one
weaving line of black on an iron glaze
plate is pure mastery, and elsewhere
the spidery drawing is subtly contrasted
with the large, formidable grey plate
on which it appears. Fie has, too, some
pale grey, undecorated porcelain pieces
reserved and unpretentious, but when
you compare these with Iwabuchi you
see the difference between the plain and
the chaste.
I wonder whether the cool, womb-
like, self-contained pots, used to store
the ashes of the dead and the wine of
life, have psychological implications
largely unexamined; pots might contain
more aesthetics than we imagine.

FILM FESTIVAL SCREENINGS
have revealed a surprising and admir-
able professionalism in Canadian
movies in the recent Sydney Festival
“Winter Kept Us Warm” and the
shorter “Donna And Gail” provided
some of the most rewarding film.
But little of this competence is vis-
ible in “The Trap,” the first big Anglo-
Canadian production, in spite of Robert
Krasker’s beautiful photography and a
remarkably engaging central perform-
ance by Rita Tushingham. t Other
Canadian films have been notable for
the honesty of their approach; the
scripts, quite apart from the screen
technique, were realistic and convincing.
“The Trap,” however, is the sort of
wildly romantic backwoods adventure
that I thought had died out long since.
Set in Canada’s pioneering days when
women were at a premium, it is the tale
of an orphan servant girl, mute from
the shock of seeing her family mas-
sacred by Indians, who is sold to a
rough trapper and taken to a log cabin
in the middle of nowhere. The trapper,
a desperately virile type given to sud-
den roars of baritone laughter, is
remarkably dilatory about enforcing his
conjugal rights; but then his heart of
gold is practically worn on his furry
sleeve, and it is surprising that it takes
our girl so long to realise his true
worth. Any moviegoer could have told
her at the start that this was the man
for her, but she has to fall over cliffs,
be attacked by Indians, and amputate
the trapper’s gangrenous leg with an
axe before love steals into her heart.
Actresses seem to yearn to play mute
girls, and Rita Tushingham here gives
her most attractive performance to date,
making the girl’s silence truly eloquent.
The rest of the players (most of them
Canadian) make up for it by yelling
their heads off. Oliver Reed as the
trapper bears a distracting resemblance


to a young Orson Welles, and is one
of the noisiest of the lot. Apart from
Miss Tushingham, the film’s main in-
terest comes from the backgrounds,
lovingly and lyrically photographed in
subtle color.
The background (Buenos Aires)
is the most interesting part also of “The
Eavesdropper,” one of the big disap-
pointments of the recent Festival, which
had a brief commercial run in Sydney.
This story of a Right-wing political
hothead hiding out in a dilapidated
hotel is full of trumped-up atmosphere.
Torre-Nilsson has obviously been
strongly influenced by Bunuel, but has
none of his genius for evoking an
ambience of macabre decadence by
apparently simple means.
Stathis Giallellis in the central role
registers less as a man with an obses-
sion than as a surly, spotty youth of
whom nobody would have taken a
second’s notice particularly the rich
society miss, played quite attractively by
Janet Margolin.
Music
Most Germanic
By PAUL FROLICH
Youth concert. Sydney Symphony Or-
chestra, conductor Dean Dixon,
soloist, Peter Frankl. Town Hall,
Sydney.
MUSICALLY SPEAKING, Dean
Dixon is one of the most Germanic
conductors I’ve heard anywhere, and
although his reading of Richard
Strauss’ colorful symphonic poem
“Don Juan” may have lacked finesse
and some of the more delicate shad-
ings of color had gone by the board,
the music came to us wholly char-
acteristic of the composer and his
methods. The pace was brisk and the
orchestra’s response accurate and en-
thusiastic, showing them in their best
form.
The other work which, despite its
brevity, sounded convincing was lan
Cugley’s “Prelude for Orchestra,” a
more personal piece than the same
young composer’s “Pan, the Lake,”
presented by John Hopkins last Feb-
ruary. The attractive prelude is scored
for extensive wind ensemble, percus-
sion, and strings (in that order of im-
portance), and, despite a superficial
similarity to Peter Sculthorpe’s static
music, shows individuality.
The most disappointing feature of
the concert, to a lover of Mozart, was
the performance of his Divertimento
K. 138, which followed on a fast-run-
ning version of the National Anthem.
For reasons which appear plausible to
Mr. Dixon, this was played by the full
string sections. Personally, I doubt that
the 16-year-old Mozart, had he been
able to avail himself of modern orch-
estral resources, would have written
music such as this work. Although the
original scoring was for a string quartet,
the step to a small string orchestra
is obvious and it is usually played in
this way. To use full string sections,
however, is a very different matter, and
I certainly object if this leads to dull-
ness where freshness should be heard.
The soloist in this concert was Peter
Frankl, a young Hungarian-born pian-
ist already well known to record collec-
tors. Mr. Frankl’s performance of
Tchaikovsky’s virtuoso Concerto No. 1
was distinguished by remarkable accur-
acy and a truly assured pianistic skill.
Although the performance evoked wild
enthusiasm, it was rather marred by
Mr. Dixon’s almost brutal conducting
and the sound of the piano. The
ABC’s Town Hall piano has rarely been
worse; it was out of tune, with a met-
allic timbre, and whilst the top keys
seemed to strike on glass, the bottom
ones produced a fuzzy blur.

“Fiddler "
Theatre
Facing "facts"
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
On Stage Vietnam. New, Sydney.
Fiddler on the Roof. Her Majesty’s,
Sydney.
THE THEATRE OF FACT, so called,
is not a theatre of fact but a theatre
of opinion. When it comes to passion-
provoking topics like the war in Viet-
nam, “facts” turn out to be like the
rules in those games children make up
for themselves. Both sides win accord-
ing to their own interpretation of the
rules, but neither side can get the
other to yield victory. Nobody, I
imagine, will be surprised to hear that
the New Theatre’s “facts” support the
cause of North Vietnam.
“On Stage Vietnam” is in the shape
of a revue with sketches and parody-
songs and dances. There is also a
narrator who fills in dates and events
and a screen on which are flashed
maps and photographs illustrating
the horrors of war. The photographs
of burned children and agonised
mothers sorted oddly with the conven-
tional revue sketches. Some of the old
familiar Communist revue figures
the French colonial officer and his
wife, whose chief recreations are drink-
ing and adultery, who speak with
comic foreign accents, the idiot British
General with his Bombay bloomers
are almost as familiar as Punch and
Judy, but they do not wear as well.
I find that the shots of burned
children remain with me very vividly,
while the rest of the revue is fading
rapidly from my mind. But in my
opinion these photographs represent
an argument against war in general
rather than against the Americans, as
the New Theatre intends. My main
objection as I watched “On Stage
Vietnam” was that no attempt is made
to distinguish between pacifist criticism
of all war and criticism of American
and Australian involvement in the
present war in Vietnam.
The New Theatre always presents
revue with great liveliness and technical
efficiency, and “On Stage Vietnam” is
no exception. As well, the choreography
by Margaret Barr adds distinction.
“Fiddler on the Roof,” set for a long
run, has the color, simplicity, and charm
of a tale from a child’s storybook with
a title like “Folk Tales from Other
Lands.” It is the story of a village com-
munity of Russian Jews in the late
nineteenth century. As in most children’s
stories, the good characters are poor and
oppressed, while the bad characters are
powerful and tyrannical. But, like most
children’s stories, the musical prefers to
skim lightly over anything unpleasant,
and we scarcely see any Russians except
when they are doing a lively stamping
dance in an inn.
Tevye has five daughters to marry, a
strong-minded wife, and a direct line to
his God, whom he frequently chides
with a good-humored shrug for the
difficulty of his lot. He tries to preserve
the old traditions, but his daughters
have other ideas and insist on choosing
their own husbands. At the end the
Jews are expelled from their village,
and most of them set out for America,
trudging around and around the revolv-
ing stage. This infuriated one London
critic, who pointed out that Jerome Rob-
bins’ previous production had been
“Mother Courage.”
The child’s picturebook settings of
the Broadway production and the lively
choreography by Jerome Robbins are
well reproduced in this Sydney produc-
tion directed by Fred Hebert, while
Hayes Gordon makes a very attractive
Tevye.
But the wry, gentle patience of an
oppressed minority depicted in this
musical seems at this moment far re-
moved from the triumphant purposeful-
ness of the new Israel.


Countries need an income, too.
Exports help to provide it. Electrolytic
Zinc Company’s exports play an
important role in providing Aus-
tralia’s income. Zinc exports to the
United Kingdom, Thailand, Hong
Kong, India, to over thirty different
countries, earned 25 million dollars
for Australia in 1965/66. That's in-
come enough to pay for nearly all
the tea we imported, or cars, or
tobacco. It’s a lot of income for
Australia, earned by EZ’s enterprise
and the quality of their product and
service.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
What happened to the long-term
Commonwealth-State survey?
THE COMMONWEALTH STATE
haggling for funds is now over. One
of the strangest things about the talks
is the fact that the question of a
long-term survey of the future of Com-
monwealth State financial relations was
not raised. Such a survey was promised
by the Commonwealth at the February
talks. Not only has the Commonwealth
failed to do anything about this but
the State premiers evidently forgot to
ask what had happened. Another ex-
planation is that there has been a
mutual understanding that the matter
should be shelved. Despite their public
relations whinging, the premiers were
happy with the outcome. Some of
them may have to increase State taxes
or charges, but they will not have to be
large increases.
As long as the States continue to get
extra Commonwealth money the way
they got it this year, there is no reason
for them to agitate to be granted
greater taxing powers. Why should
they accept the odium of levying taxes
when the Commonwealth will take it
and hand over the money? The Com-
monwealth, on the other hand, re-
fuses to face up to the need to give
the States any new taxing rights. It
is afraid its central powers will be
eroded, and, anyway, it does not know
which way it might let the States go.
Following strong departmental advice,
the Treasurer did last week raise the
suggestion that the States move into a
general purchase tax or a State payroll
tax if they needed more money. But
it was raised without serious convic-
tion.
Mining
A holy alliance
THE HEARTY APPLAUSE for Sir
Maurice Mawby, after his address to
the Australian Industries Development
Association meeting at the Windsor in
Melbourne, was like sealing a holy alli-
ance between our booming minerals
world and local manufacturers now
looking confidently to the upsurge in
mining to give a much-needed new
impetus to secondary industry develop-
ment. The only regret Sir Maurice
seemed to have was that, so far, the
miners had failed to get it across that
theirs was a respectable industry. This
was a difficult task, he said, because
there were relatively few people in it,
its voting power was small, and some
institutions won’t look at big nationally
essential minerals projects unless they
can see an immediate return of seven
and a half percent after tax. If Repco
chairman Mr. C. G. McGrath’s thought
that at least the mining industry’s
respectability has recently been acknow-
ledged on the stock exchanges wasn’t all
that much comfort to Sir Maurice, at
least he had plenty of solid backing
from Sir George Fisher later in the week
for his lament that the institutions were
myopic toward it.
Giving his presidential address to the
Sir Maurice Mawby... “Respectable”
Australasian Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy (during which he said
recent mining developments were as im-
portant as several Bendigos and Kal-
goorlies put together and require enor-
mous supplies of capital), Sir George
made the stinging observation that some
underwriting brokers have been saying
that local capital for mining ventures
was in short supply “except when
prospects of success are such that the
element of speculation is removed.” Mt.
Isa’s chief was equally as cutting on
the question of Australian equity par-
ticipation, making the colorful comment
that some Australians seem to feel that
they are entitled to a substantial equity
in important new discoveries without
having been involved in any way in the
exploration phase. “This is like claiming
an interest in a Melbourne Cup winner
after the race,” he said, and added that
perhaps the punter should have shown
interest at the risky period of the year-
ling sales.
Both Sir Maurice and Sir George
were adamant about the essentiality of
overseas capital in mining, and neither,
particularly the latter, cared much
where it came from, provided we got
it. This wasn’t just the view of the
heads of our two biggest mining groups,
which (CRA as to 85 percent and Mt.
Isa to 59 percent) are predominantly
overseas owned. It was also that of the
Institute of Public Affairs in an exhaus-
tive examination of the local demand-
supply position of capital availability
here in a new release last week in
which the IPA also continues to pour
cold water on the Bankers’ Development
Refinance Corporation as a possible
medium of getting significant relief
from our marginal dependability on
overseas capital supplies.
Western Australia
Saving water
THE W.A. STATE Government has
quickly taken up the germ of an idea
from a Western Australian engineer,
which, developed by the State’s Works
Department, promises to halve the
West’s high evaporation rate in storage
dams and might be useful elsewhere.
Evaporation is such a drastic problem
that extremely expensive covers are
sometimes needed for example at
Geraldton’s town water supply, covered
with 17 acres of corrugated asbestos.
Interlocking hexagonal floats of
polystyrene foam board have been used
over the past seven months on a
100,000-gallon storage tank at Beverley,
in W.A. Last December, when tempera-
tures went into the 90s, the floats re-
duced evaporation, 84 percent.
The idea belongs to 53-year-old
businessman-engineer Mr. James Gal-
loway, who had been concerned with
the high wastage of water on a prop-
erty he is developing in the hot and
dry Balledonia area. He tried putting
conventional protective coating on the
water, but this was broken by wind-
driven waves.
Then he thought of the foam board
and put the idea to Works Minister
Ross Hutchinson, whose department
estimates the life of the floats at five
years (more with protective coatings
being developed) and the cost of saving
1000 gallons of water $1.60.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The States will receive an addi-
tional s2som. or 11 percent, after the Premiers’ annual
wrangle for handouts from the Commonwealth ... The
new Treasury White Paper, The Australian Economy 1967,
shows defence commitments as a formidable item for many
years to come.
Freight rates between Australia and the U.K. rose 3|
percent from July 1.
The N.S.W. State Industrial Commission granted a $1
a week increase to all adults employed under State awards.
For the marhets: Mining fever, the main factor
in lifting Australian share prices by ten percent during
1966-67, eased a little last week, but still pushed BHP to
its best-ever price of $9.44 (which helped the Melbourne
index of leaders to hit an all-time high).
Equities reached new peaks for the year in London. Buying,
with institutions prominent, was persistent throughout.
The stock market in New York was mixed, with the pre-
holiday weekend session bringing sluggish trading.
For companies : Takeovers were big news again.
Macßobertson directors had intended to accept Cadbury-
Fry-Pascall’s offer for half their ordinary shares, until rival
bidder Mars, despite earlier protestations that it would not
enter into an auction, revised its terms up by 5c to $l.BO
for all the ordinary shares, or $2.25 for half, and $2.20
for the prefs. Cadbury’s bid then automatically lapsed . . .
In a complicated series of takeovers, Fibre Containers
(which concurrently acquired H. Jones’ minority sharehold-
ing in its Tasmanian subsidiary) will take over Dodge Con-
solidated and then will itself become a partly-owned sub-
sidiary of British Tobacco.
A mystery buyer succeeded with his offer of 40c cash
per share for 12} percent of Strata’s capital. Discussions
are now taking place between the mystery man and direc-
tors . . Directors of the Victoria Insurance Ltd. unani-
mously rejected the takeover bid of $3.15 cash per share
from Federation Insurance . . . and Stocks and Holdings
bought a 29 percent interest in Auto and General Finance.
Andersons Seeds offered a one-for-five issue of 50c shares
at 10c premium (to raise $250,000) . . . and Sydney elec-
trical and electronic equipment supplier Jacoby Mitchell
announced a one-for-ten issue of 50c shares at 30c premium.
Earning rate is down sharply for James Hardie Asbestos,
whose profit fell 20 percent in the year to March, after
higher tax provision . . . William Adams profit fell four
percent in the face of 3 } percent higher turnover, in the
year to April . . . Hume Far East expects a profit fall for
the year to December, although the 15 percent dividend
should be held . . . and Vickers Australia warns of a profit
fall for the year to October, owing to completion of an
unprofitable contract.
Carlton and United’s profit for the December half firmed
slightly . . . whereas Shelley’s profits for the April half
were lower despite higher sales . . . An 18 percent profit
jump allows Bushells Investments to disburse 12c a share
instead of the usual 10c.
The first nickel concentrate in Australia was produced
by Western Mining at its Kambalda plant on the shores
of Lake Lefroy . . . The nickel prospect of Metal’s Explora-
tion in Greenvale, North Queensland, is revealed as a 30-
50m. ton field of unknown grade, suitable for open-cut
mining . . . Even its directors now know that Hill 50 Gold
Mine has found a richer ore body in its Mt. Magnet mine.
MEN AND MATTERS
ADELAIDE HAS SENT many fine
engineering graduates across the border
to Broken Hill over the years. But
none of them has made a more impres-
sive journey further on to the top of
the Australian mining hierarchy than
Sir George Fisher, who was knighted
in the latest birthday honors. This year
Sir George, a lively 64, has made a
clean sweep of the industry’s own
honors in perhaps its most glorious year,
being president of the new Australian
Mineral Industry Council and also, for
the third time, of the very much older
Australasian Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy, of which he’s been a mem-
ber for 44 years.
A commanding figure at the in-
dustry’s annual get-together in Mel-
bourne last week, Sir George recalled
his early days at the Zinc Corporation
mine with relish and nostalgia, even to
two candles that once lighted his way
as surveyor and ultimately manager
underground there. At the end of the
war he became general manager of
operations. Fisher stayed with Zinc Cor-
poration 25 years, then in 1952 went to
Mt. Isa Mines Ltd. as vice-chairman to
Julius Kruttschnitt. When the latter
retired a year later he took over the
chair, which has been his ever since.
Sir George has performed miracles
at Mt. Isa itself, where he’s presided
over the mine’s development into one
of the world’s biggest non-ferrous metals
operations and
also its refinery
outworkings a t
Townsville. It has
been far from
plain sailing, es-
pecially in labor
relations, where
the image was
blurred by the
disastrous strike
in 1964. But if Sir
George failed to
prevent this, heads
would have be-
come a lot hotter at the Isa without
him.
EX-RAAF PILOT Ronald Walker, for
ten years after the war Reg Ansett’s
right-hand man, was, toward the end
of his stay at Ansett Transport Indus-
tries, executive director for aviation in
the group. He is now flying even higher
in the business world. Ten days after
the Falcon jet he recently bought in
France arrives at Essendon on July 16,
he, as managing director of his own
company, Business Jets Pty. Ltd., will
inaugurate Australia’s first business jet
service to carry Australian businessmen
to out-of-the-way places here (its first
trip will be to Mt. Tom Price with ten
passengers and three crew aboard).
J. Kruttschnitt
Sir George Fisher
R. R. Walker
Costing about $1.4 million each as
well as a substantial sum for adaptation
costs (which Walker hopes to recoup),
the Mystere 20 Falcons he will use (one
for a start) mean that Business Jets, a
company with only $400,000 capital,
has big private backers. Walker admits
to this, but who they are remains a
mystery. It wmuld be intriguing, say, if
Mr. Ansett was one of them, as would
be the possibility of an official link up
with a public company.
Born in Swan Hill, Mr. Walker went
to the high school there, subsequently
went to Melbourne University on a
Myer Scholarship, and graduated in
commerce shortly before going into the
RAAF.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
"Increasing official
controls over
business affairs"
BY J. C. HORSFALL
MR. C. T. LOOKER, probably our
most forceful and articulate financier,
is awfully shy of the public platform. I
don’t know why. He makes more sense
than most when talking about the
Australian corporate financial scene.
It is a pity that as chairman of the
Stock Exchange of Melbourne this last
year or so he hasn’t treated us to
more of his thoughts in the manner
he did some nights ago at a “private”
gathering of the Chartered Institute
of Secretaries. On that occasion he
was a bit surprised that, unlike the
rest of the Press, who were content with
a formal handout of his address, I’d
smuggled myself in to pick up a few
crumbs from his cuff. I promised not
to put him “in” too far.
What disturbed me most about Mr.
Looker’s talk was its underlying premise
that, as he said twice, we are moving
toward a “controlled or planned
economy” and “increasing government
controls over all business affairs l
suppose from where Mr. Looker sits
(and also to most people in the com-
pany world, especially the company
secretaries to whom he was speaking) a
fatalistic attitude on this is under-
standable, considering the intrusions of
government in recent years. To name
a few of these affecting companies since
1960, there has been the 30/20 rule for
life offices which has warped the in-
terest rate structure and poisoned the
whole area of equity investment, the
1961 Uniform Companies Act itself,
coupled with its supplemental legis-
lative strictures on borrowing corpor-
ations and company management, and,
latest of all, the Trade Practices Act,
shortly to be proclaimed.
Now, of course, as Mr. Looker some-
what ruefully contemplated, the, Attor-
neys-General, if not the Federal Govern-
ment per se, are on the warpath again.
They are brooding over a host of
proposed new amendments to the Uni-
form Companies Act, mostly relating to
its audit and accounts provisions. Some
°f these, such as the proposed audit
provisions, Looker thought would do
much to overcome the difficult situa-
tions in which auditors have found
themselves recently. On the other hand
a lot of the others would make the
life of directors and company secre-
taries hell and could complicate invest-
ment to no useful purpose. The latter
relate mainly to the amount of informa-
tion companies are obliged to disclose
about their affairs and to the legal obli-
gations of directors. For instance, it is
proposed that the profit of each sub-
sidiary of a group be stated separately;
that specific figures be given on the
purchase and sale of subsidiaries; that
information be given on the different
business conducted by groups, on gross
revenue and sales and other items. It is
also proposed to require directors to
indicate whether fixed assets realise
their book values and, if not, what
would they fetch!
With all this and much more being
discussed by the A-Gs it was a good
question to ask Mr. Lookef whether
the Stock Exchange was itself consider-
ing tightening up its listing require-
ments. That, for the company secretary,
C. T. Looker... a fatalistic attitude
would evidently be the last straw. Mr.
Looker wasn’t telling about this because
he was only one member on a com-
mittee of ten. For his personal part he
seemed more concerned to stop the
Attorneys-General running riot. With
Looker at the Stock Exchange helm I
would say the odds would be strongly
against more stringent listing require-
ments, at least pending the outcome of
present exercises of the Attorneys-
General. In the interim, Stock Ex-
changes and bodies such as the Institute
of Secretaries should continue with their
strenuous efforts to try to stop the
legislators making bigger asses of them-
selves than they might otherwise in
their enthusiasm to make the law do
all the work of protecting investors,
leaving nothing to the chance that
directors and company management in
general might, wittingly or not, let their
sides down.
Mr. Looker said he subscribed whole-
heartedly to the principle of full dis-
closure. It was only that its full prac-
tical application could lead the com-
pany world into a bog. On its impli-
cations for directors, he said he could
not help wondering if the duties placed
on directors and management by statute
may get us to a position where only
those will accept directorates who either
show great courage or are ignorant of
the law. Again, he asked, “Is what the
shareholder may legally expect from
his company management going to
mean an increasing trend toward
executive directors who assumably will
know more of the company’s operation
and legal obligations?” If so, he thought
it would be a pity because “the out-
side director can make an important
contribution to most boards by virtue
of his probable wider range of know-
ledge from which the executive director
is excluded.”
Even so, Mr. Looker said afterwards
that he was inclined to favor having a
preponderance of executive directors on
company boards. This is the trend, of
course, but at least in the view of Mr.
Justice Menzies the outside director
must not be lost sight of as a valuable
adjunct to boards as he was “likely to
be of particular advantage to a com-
pany, especially by way of infusing
capable and wise counsel and leader-
ship free from any specialist narrowness
that the doing of one job is likely to
engender.” As I’ve said, Looker has no
doubts about the importance of outside
directors, either. Nor should he, because
he fills that role on several boards.
The question of government control
of business aside, there’s no doubt that,
as Mr. Looker said, “as corporations
and our economy grow bigger the mat-
ter of national interest and community
interest as a whole will tend to intrude
itself more and more into decisions.”
Also, in Sir Garfield Barwick’s terms,
a case can be made for “self-restraint
and self-discipline in commerce and
industry” aimed at giving weight to the
consequences for society of any
proposed course. Granted the validity
of these two propositions, I don’t see
why outside directors, as a class in
modern Australia, would be any better
qualified than executive directors to
conform with them. To do their job
properly, be it in the context of the
general community interest or of the
narrower company one, all directors
need to know and understand the place
their companies occupy in the overall
situation of the society in which they
operate as well as in its economic and,
in particular, its industrial structure.
Directors should be able to assess
the consequences of their decisions on
the current and prospective situation
and trends in the community. What is
more, if the vast majority of directors
be so qualified —I am not saying one
way or the other about this —the result-
ing society will be infinitely better for
it. Decidedly better, say, than the one
which Sir Garfield depicts in which
each company blindly follows its own
narrow interest without regard to an
overall picture or to the consequences
of its decisions. If all directors were
inspired by broad community motives,
government control of business could
be reduced to a minimum. How far
we are away from this position and
whether most companies behave much
better than the authorities give them
credit for are two very open questions.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Too conventional to
have the pleasure
of dying rich
WAY BACK IN 1940 a keen, young
Wall Streeter gave the following recipe
for finding the pot of gold (nickel
wasn’t in vogue then) at the end of the
investment rainbow:
“When there is a stock market boom,
and everyone is scrambling for com-
mon stock, take all your common stocks
and sell them. Take the proceeds and
buy conservative bonds. No doubt the
stocks you sold will go higher. Pay
no attention to this, just wait for the
depression which will come sooner or
later. When this depression or panic
becomes a national catastrophe, sell
out the bonds (perhaps at a loss) and
buy back the stocks. No doubt the stocks
will go still lower. Again pay no atten-
tion. Wait for the next boom. Continue
to repeat this operation as long as you
live and you’ll have the pleasure of
dying rich.”
I don’t know what happened to the
young oracle of 1940, but I suspect he
is now either still sprouting advise on
how to make a million or lolling back
in the lap of luxury in Bermuda. I
only mentioned his theory because the
general principles are worth remember-
ing. Financial history can only prove
that the system would work admirably.
The problem, of course, is picking the
right time to act. Selling too early in a
boom and buying too late in a depres-
sion could mean that a $lOO investment
remains a $lOO investment. Neverthe-
less it’s still a theory I would not mind
trying.
But at heart I’m too conventional.
My first conventional move this week
was to buy 200 Brambles. This stock
caught my eye because its price is
down and its turnover is up. Brambles
is one of the largest road transport
companies in Australia. It is also num-
ber one in the “For-Hire” road tanker
business in Australia. The rate of
growth in road freight transport in Aus-
tralia is currently about six percent,
but the co-ordinated road-rail-sea trade
is expected to bring this figure into
line with U.S.A. trends where the rate
is closer to ten percent. More pertinent,
however, to this year’s profit are the
dividends due from the Breckett con-
tract for recovering steel scraps from
the BHP open-hearth slag and refuse
at Newcastle and Port Kembla. This
contract has yielded Brambles around
$300,000 a year over the past few years.
Last year, however, $200,000 due in
dividends to Brambles did not reach
the company in time to be taken into
the year’s results and will now be in-
cluded in the current year’s profit
These pointers plus the directors’
statement that this year’s profits will
“compare favorably” with last year were
enough to stir me to action.
Talking of action, how about the
80.3 percent high-jump in motor bike
registrations for the January-April
period. Not bad, eh? I bet Bennett &
Wood think so. They are the organis-
ation which distributes Honda motor-
cycles (Australia’s top seller) to “the
nicest people” in Queensland and New
South Wales. Last year the company’s
profits took a nose-dive from $142,286
down to $44,734. This year things look
much better, especially when you re-
member that a lot of Honda’s sales are
for farm work and these sales are not
included in the registration figures.
With a price at five cents above the 50c
par and an asset backing of 2.8 times
par, the stock looks a fair buy.
As much as I think the coal industry
is a good one, I’ve decided to cut down
my holding in it. This week I sold
Coal and Allied, but Millers and Thiess
remain. My other sale was Amalga-
mated Holdings. I don’t know if “Alfie”
had anything to do with it, but during
the week the stock went up 15 cents
and I decided to sell. Both deals helped
the profit jar; Amalgamated earned me
19 cents a share in seven weeks and
Coal and Allied added 13 cents a share
over four months.

IN THE ESTATE OF
JAMES GREEN, DECEASED.
NOTICE is hereby given pursuant to
an order of the Supreme Court of
South Australia that all persons claim-
ing as next of kin (or as the legal
personal representative of any person
who is claimed to have at his death
been one of his next of kin) to be
beneficially entitled to share in the
distribution of the intestate estate of
JAMES GREEN, late of Hillcrest Hos-
pital, Fosters Road, Gilles Plains, in
the State of South Australia, labourer,
deceased, who died at Gilles Plains
aforesaid on the 23rd day of Septem-
ber, 1964, intestate, are to send by pre-
paid post full particulars in writing of
their claims to JOHNSTONE &
OLSSON, Solicitors, of Steamship
Buildings, 17 Currie Street, Adelaide,
aforesaid, within one month of the
publishing of this notice, otherwise they
may be excluded from the distribution
of the above estate. DATED this 13th
day of June, 1967. J. Bochur, a Deputy
Master of the Supreme Court of South
Australia. NOTE: It is believed that
the deceased was married to one Alice
Green (or A. E. Green or Alice E.
Green), but it has not proved possible
to locate any evidence of this marriage
or of the present whereabouts or of
the death of the alleged wife. The last
known addresses of the said Alice
Green are 3 Spring Street. Abbotsford,
and 23 Bland Street, Ashfield, in the
State of New South Wales. The de-
ceased was one of the issue of the mar-
riage between Charles Henry Green and
Elizabeth Green, formerly Kelly
formerly Eccleston, and was born in
England on the 6th day of August,
1885. Other than the said deceased
there were five issue of the last-
mentioned marriage, namely Charles
Henry Green, who survived the de-
ceased; Florence Greenlees, formerly
Green, who predeceased the deceased;
Ellen Greenfield, formerly Green, who
predeceased the deceased; Minnie
Smith, formerly Green, and Sophia
Green, both of whom survived the
deceased. If the deceased’s wife, the
said Alice Green, survived him, she
would be entitled to share in the dis-
tribution of his estate.

By JASON
WHAT A WEEK the financial vear
ended on: a buoyant Treasury White
Paper on the economy, the Loan
Council, Western Mining beginning
nickel production, BHP going to a
record price. And, for what it is
worth, the Sydney share price index
closed at 362.54, or only 4| percent
below its all-time peak of 1964.
It all augured well for 1967-68. And
there should be some good profits made
this year. Leaders like BHP and ACI
have an interesting appearance still, and
so do many of the market laggards
that have not yet caught up with the
better times. But the big question of
whether WMC will continue to rise now
the major buyer, Selection Trust, is
out of the market, is yet to be answered.
It seems likely to do so, as there is now
a real scrip shortage, and the news from
WMC is likely to continue to be good.
There are obvious sectors where things
should be improving, such as the steel
merchants, motor vehicle parts makers,
and agricultural equipment makers that
had all been depressed for good reasons.
Stocks like J. Blackwood, that was re-
viewed here last week, or William
Adams, which last week put out a profit
that fell 4 percent, have real interest.
Directors of William Adams expect an
improvement in the earning rate (which
dropped from 20 percent to 15.8 percent
following last year’s share issue), so the
12| percent dividend looks safe enough.
And with most of the group’s problems
apparently due to its tractor subsidiary,
which is expected to improve, the higher
sales (up 3.5 percent) should lead to
higher profits next year.
The chemical companies should do
better, not only from the higher rural
sales that should follow the recovery
period from the drought, but also
because of the impact on some of them
of the new tariff structure.
And so should textiles, particularly
good ones like Universal Textiles, the
old STP-Terryson companies, that the
market has wrongly marked down. And
Bradford Cotton should have a reason-
able year.
Among the agricultural implement
makers, disc manufacturer Ralph
McKay seems an outstanding proposi-
tion at prices well below its pre-drought
levels.
The market is certainly treating
Holden parts makers like Duly and
Hansford most severely, with largest
prices around 90 cents (under the $1
par value) suggesting that investors
fear the 6 percent dividend could be
further cut. There can be no doubt
about the way Ford is eating into
Holden registrations, and that it could
take a couple of years before Holden
can effectively fight back. But Dufor is
a well-respected name in the parts busi-
ness, and it seems unlikely that this
company would fall much further. The
scope for improvement, once things
pick up at Holden, is remarkable.
Another parts manufacturer that
should do better is gear-maker Borg
Warner, but this one, too, could take a
fair while to come good. More imme-
diately, some of the Ford distributors
should be putting in good results. And
so should AGC, which has a large Ford
hire-purchase business.
But BHP is still the most impressive-
looking stock of all. The $3.38 these
shares added during 1966-67 to close the
year at $9.44 is almost justifiable on the
group’s iron ore and steel operations
alone, let alone its staggering oil and
gas prospects.
In its Mount Newman deal, BHP is,
for all practical purposes, getting 70
million tons of iron ore free, for a
capital cost of less than $1 a ton, com-
pared with the export price of $8 a ton.
The cost savings to BHP must be enor-
mous. Admittedly, BHP would not save
all of the difference between $1 and
The Chartist says:
Investors holding AUSTRALIA HOTEL LTD. must indeed be heartened to learn
that the downward trend held since 1960 until late 1966 has now been broken and
the stock is a promising recovery situation. Prices rose to a high of 54c on high
volume at the beginning of this year and a reaction hack to 40c hasi since followed.
It has now established an uptrend at a basic rate of 60 percent appreciation per
annum and once prices move above 50c a short term move to about 75c is indicated
with a longer term target of approximately $l.OO. The situation would call for
reassessment should prices fall below 40c in the short term. Last sale price on
27/6/67 —47 c.


the $8 export price, because BHP, no
doubt, supplies itself with iron ore from
its own quarries at far cheaper than
that. But it does mean it is getting its
iron ore for $7 a ton cheaper than its
Japanese rivals—a saving of almost $5OO
million over its 70-million-ton contract
with itself at Mount Newman.
That saving represents a share.
In terms of the real cost BHP faces
from its own quarries, Mt. Newman
would probably be worth about $2 a
share to BHP, however. And then BHP
has developed its own export deals from
other iron ore deposits it has scattered
around the place. At the same time, steel
production is going up and the economy
looks sounder. So there is still plenty
of scope for oil and gas to make an
even more significant impact on BHP
shares. This is a boom with a solid
backing in fact.
THE SIGNIFICANCE of last week’s
James Hardie Asbestos result is not
that the group’s net profit fell by 20
percent (some sort of fall was inevitable
when the Wunderlich-Humes tax losses
ran out). It was that the company con-
tinued to increase its pre-tax profits; it
exactly maintained its 6 percent 1965-66
growth rate in pre-tax profits despite
the serious impact of a sharp fall in
building industry activity in S.A.
The realities of the James Hardie
situation are that pre-tax profits in the
past three years have risen from $5.5
million to $5.8 million to $6.15 million
in the year to March, 1967—a reason-
able rate of progress in the circum-
stances of the building industry in
recent times. But net profits were
boosted in 1965-66 by the tax losses
available from the acquisition of the
unsuccessful Wunderlich-Humes pipe
operation, which enabled tax to fall by
$787,000, even though pre-tax profits
for that year had risen by $310,000. It
is this “distortion” that makes the latest
net profit figure look so unappealing.
So now the tax provision is back to
its remarkable heights of 53.4 percent
of pre-tax profit (it was 54.3 percent
two years before, compared with the
statutory percent) as the company
continues to charge far more than the
tax commissioner allows as depreciation
on its plant and equipment. Neverthe-
less, even without this distortion, the
rise in profits has not been enough to
offset the higher capital raised in
November, 1965, and so net earning
rate has eased slightly from 29.6 per-
cent in 1964-65 to 27.3 percent in
1966-67.
Housing was not the only factor run-
ning against Hardie’s last year; it has
a big stake in the dull motor industry
through its brake-linings business. With
latest statistics suggesting that these two
sectors could be a little healthier
(although housing, particularly in South
Australia, is still well and truly down)
there seem to be good prospects that
Hardie will have a better economic
climate to operate in during the current
financial year. The latest result should
not do anything to dent its high market
status.
A.I.D.A.
44th Annual Meeting
26th JUNE, 1967
Mr. F. M. WILTSHIRE, O.B.E., President
We now come to the presentation of our 44th Annual Report. You will all
have a copy of the printed Report in your possession. It is not my purpose
to take up the time of the meeting by dealing with the year’s work in detail
but there are one or two matters deserving of comment.
The first is the Act recently promulgated to stimulate Industrial Research
and Development. Already there has been criticism of this legislation in con-
sequence of which some comment is warranted in case its importance is
obscured.
This legislation breaks new ground in Australia; it is basically designed to
meet Australian needs and temperament, and is, therefore, different in concept
from legislation used elsewhere in the world to the same end.
Credit is due to Government for recognising the need and to the Opposi-
tion for accepting the principle. And credit is due to a large number of people
in private industry who worked to bring an understanding of the need to
Government. This Association was one of the bodies involved and its members
have played a part within this and other groups in building a case for Govern-
ment action.
In my view, the passage of this legislation confirms one of the principles
on which this Association stands, namely that sober, informed opinion ex-
pressed by people engaged in industry is of real value to Government, and
is welcomed by Government, particularly in those areas where only industrial
experience can give clear guidance.
Last year I referred to the great satisfaction with which the Association
saw the creation of the Office of Secondary Industry. Our satisfaction arose
from the fact that we had constantly urged Government to give Departmental
status to manufacturing industry as had been done in earlier years to other
branches of our industrial structure. It is with regret that we have read
attacks on this new Office and its personnel, including the responsible Minister.
The reasons for these attacks are somewhat obscure, for this office is a
valuable addition to our national administration and will, I am sure, reflect
in its operations the great contribution to national development which manu-
facturing industry has made and will continue to make.
This leads me to the subject referred to earlier, namely the publicity that
has been given to criticisms of our manufacturing industry and the level of
protection afforded it.
All the evidence suggests that this criticism emanates from small minorities
who are, however, notably articulate. A disturbing feature of the material
published from some sources is that it has an air of propaganda about it
rather than of thoughtful, objective, debate.
It is to be deplored that a matter of such consequence to Australian
development should be used as a pawn in political manoeuvring. The people
responsible should know that the encouragement and protection of all viable
industry is the policy desired by the great majority of Australians, and the
publicly acknowledged policy of all the political parties that serve them.
They should also know that our means of devising tariff's through an
advisory Board is the most open, impersonal, system used anywhere in the
world, and I include here the most highly developed countries. The truth
is that protection in various forms is a tool of development employed by
every country, and the methods used elsewhere are frequently more direct
and rigorous than ours.
It goes without saying that there will be room for informed debate, from
time to time, on the manner in which this economic weapon is used in par-
ticular circumstances, just as there is on the use of other economic weapons
like taxation and credit policy; but we shall not find the right answers in
the emotional climate of political propaganda. The national interests will
best be served by addressing ourselves to the facts.
You will be pleased to know that your Executive is examining plans to
strengthen the Association so that it can express itself more adequately on these
and related matters than has been the case in the past. Unquestionably, the
need exists. I am confident that a way will be found.
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present this 44th Annual Report
and to invite our Chairman of Committees, Sir William Anderson, to support
me.
Sir William Anderson, C.8.E., in supporting the adoption of the Annual
Report, reiterated the theme of last year’s Annual Meeting - namely, the
need for Government and industry to work together and for leading business-
men to make themselves available to serve on advisory boards and committees.
He quoted the lead given by members of A.I.D.A. in this field naming a
number who are giving their time to serve in this capacity. Sir William con-
cluded by asking for complete co-operation and exchange of views with
Government.

The Melbourne Market
Cars, bricks and hot water
WINTERBOTTOM, the Western Aus-
tralian car, truck, tractor, and aero-
plane dealer, has settled round $1 after
the rise which followed the bright
interim report earlier this year. At
this level the 50-cent shares seem ter-
ribly cheap, and they are providing a
71 percent return from the 15 percent
dividend while waiting for the capital
gains which should not be too far
distant.
In 1965-66 the company lifted net
profit 84 percent as a result of its
rapidly expanding market and earned
38.3 percent on capital. As it was the
group’s fiftieth year the usual 2f per-
cent bonus dividend was doubled to five
percent to make total payout for the
year 15 percent. In the first half of
the current year sales and profits showed
a “marked increase.” With any luck
(and not much will be needed) earn-
ing rate for the current year, usually
announced in September, will come out
somewhere around 50 percent.
This must be the only company on
the lists which can earn at such a level
and still see its shares priced to yield
at fixed-interest rates. It is hard to
understand why, but perhaps it is a
combination of the fact that it is a
car dealer, listed only in Perth and
Melbourne. It has the W.A. BMC-
Chrysler-Rootes franchise and the
Nuffield and Case tractor franchises.
Its new-vehicle sales jumped 27 per-
cent in the latest December half, with-
out any help from the new models
which Chrysler has on the market, and
it sold two t)f its “Mooney” aircraft.
In the June 30 half, it should have done
even better.
It seems very likely that money
should be made from the shares in the
near future. At worst, the market’s
realisation of the group’s prospects
should lift the price, perhaps when the
annual result is announced. More
likely is some concrete benefit from the
company itself. If it is earning at 50
percent, the prospects for a dividend
increase are strong the group has
made 25 percent payouts in its day.
Equally enticing is the chance of a
bonus issue. The group’s reserves are
well in excess of its paid capital and it
has made bonus issues before. Or, it
may make a cash issue, especially if the
rapid growth it is enjoying is strain-
ing resources and calling for expansion.
And to add to its attractions the risk
of losing money on this stock seems
slight.
BRAEMAR CAME BACK to its 50
cent par value this week to yield eight
percent from a payout that was covered
twice by earnings in 1965-66. Directors
have said profits are expected to be
higher in the current year, so it is a
little hard to fathom the market’s dis-
enchantment with the stock.
The group is basically in engineering,
specialising in water heating, cooling,
and treatment equipment. It is also in
materials handling and the manufacture
of specialised industrial products, like
valves. Because of its nation-wide spread
in these fields, it should get substantial
gains from the introduction of natural
gas; this of course is a long-term con-
sideration. While its short-term pros-
pects do not sparkle, they do not com-
pletely lack the growth element, and
there seems little reason for the shares
to be as low as par.
SEVERAL FACTORS emerging from
last week’s annual meeting and recent
annual report indicate the 50-cent
shares in Brick and Pipe Industries Ltd.
would be good buying at their current
95 cents for medium- to long-term
investors. There appear to be two direc-
tions from which benefits could come:
first, from eventually increased divi-
dends, and, second, from a share issue
to shareholders.
“The more profits we make, the more
we’ll distribute,” Brick and Pipe’s
finance director, Mr. A. C. P. Shergold,
replied last week to a shareholder who
had been urging a lift in the group’s
dividend from to 15 percent the
rate paid from 1955 to 1962, before a
series of issues, placements, and take-
overs more than doubled paid capital
to its present level. He pointed out, and
rightly so, that the issues had resulted
in a substantial increase in cash pay-
outs to shareholders, despite the lower
dividend rate.
The company’s chairman, Mr. R. I.
Hamilton, spoke of the large spending
on plants and clay deposits and the
need for liquidity. With rising costs,
he felt it would be wiser to wait for

a year or so before considering a higher
dividend; this point is particularly
salient in view of the 20 percent earn-
ing rate, which supplies a relatively safe
cover for a 12J percent payout, but
could not guarantee a continued 15
percent rate if earnings performance
dipped at all in the future. A fact worth
remembering is that most of the men
on the board are fairly large share-
holders in the company and, as such,
would be keen to increase their own
income through raising the dividend.
But increased dividends will not be
feasible without some improvement in
the earning rate. The nature of the
company’s business and the calibre of
its management indicate such a trend in
the long run. For the current year to
March 31, 1968 and 1968-69, however,
the emphasis will be on the fight with
rising costs and the severe competition
which some of the group’s lines are
meeting. If these factors prevent an
improved return on capital and better
dividends, then the second prong of the
fork, which makes the shares attractive
may come into play a share issue. ’
The company’s past history indicates
that the board has a leaning toward
share issues, especially where it can
tack on a premium and so finance
operations at a cost which is closer to
fixed interest levels on the capital
involved.
Mr. Hamilton’s annual address indi-
cated that a share issue may well be
on the cards in future. During 1966-67
the results from some of the group’s
pressed-brick plants and the terracotta
roofing plant were disappointing; this
reflected a swing in the industry from
the lower priced, lower quality pressed
brick to the higher priced, better quality
wire-cut, smooth-face brick. If the
trend continues the company may be
faced with the cost of converting some
of its pressed-brick plants to wire cuts.
The company’s terracotta tiles have
been affected by competition from con-
crete tiles; the answer here lies in
reducing terracotta production costs
through increased mechanisation.
In both fields, the path to greater
profits lies in capital expenditure on
plant. As the group is not in a very
liquid position and has a large bank
loan to repay, an issue to shareholders
may be the answer. As the finance
would not merely be for working capi-
tal, but for expenditure which would
(in theory) lead to increased profits,
an issue would be justified.
At 95 cents the shares are not
historically high. They reached as high
as $2.95 in 1961 and as low as 64 cents
in 1963, so an upward move may be
more likely than a downward. Asset
backing is more than $1 and the cur-
rent yield from dividends is a not un-
attractive 6iy percent after brokerage.
If the company wins against its present
adversity there should be higher divi-
dends before long. If not, there may
be a share issue which should also lead
to success. In either case, medium- to
long-term investors should make money.

Security analysis
“Norths” has more to offer
than lead and zinc
IN A RECENT ISSUE of The Bulletin
(June 17), the Chartist stated that
North Broken Hill was “in an interest-
ing, technical situation, with prospects
of further capital gains.”
For a stock that is often regarded as
being somewhat “stodgy,” the share
price of “Norths” has already appreci-
ated rather dramatically this year from
a low price of $3.21 in February to the
current price of around $5 (having
touched $5.40), which yields 5 percent,
covered 1.4 times by estimated 1966/67
earnings. This has probably been due
to a combination of reasons, e.g., earlier
rumors that the Collins House group
(Broken Hill South, North Broken Hill,
and Western Mining Corporation)
would merge (since denied); uncon-
firmed reports that a large overseas
mining company would make a take-
over bid for Norths; the spectacular
increase in the market value of Norths’
315,761 shares in WMC (now worth
over $6 million, or 33c per North
Broken Hill share); growing indications
that the price of silver is likely to be
increased in the near future; the com-
pany’s now substantial exploration pro-
gram which includes a nickel prospect
(together with WMC) south of Kam-
balda in the Fraser Range; and the
buoyancy of the mining market.
A feature of Norths is the relatively
large percentage of total profits derived
from its investment portfolio.

(B) Assuming maintenance of the present 25%
rate (25c per share)
Norths’ most important investments
are its 30 percent holding in the Broken
Hill Associated Smelters Pty. Ltd. which
in 1965/66 contributed $900,000 in divi-
dend income; its 7 percent interest in
EZ Industries Ltd. ($469,000); and
Its 12 percent interest in Alcoa of Aus-
tralia Pty. Ltd. (to date nil). As indi-
cated in the article on BH South, it is
now thought “most probable” that
Alcoa will pay a 10 percent dividend
in 1971/72. This would provide Norths
with an additional $600,000 in dividend
income (or 3.3 cents per share). In
the case of BHAS, Norths’ dividend in-
come from this source should increase
substantially once the returns flow from
jhe $l5 million electrolytic zinc smelt-
mg plant which will treat lead-zinc slag
from the Port Pirie dump (estimated
to contain one million tons of recover-
able zinc). Consequently, North’s net
investment income seems certain to
continue increasing, and by the early
1970 s could well contribute around 25
cents per share, the current dividend
rate.
With respect to Norths’ mining activi-
ties, the most recent major develop-
ment was the completion in 1962 of the
No. 3 shaft, which cost $l4 million
(financed entirely from internal re-
sources). In 1965/66, the tonnage of
ore mined from the No. 3 shaft area
exceeded that from the No. 2 shaft for
the first time, and by 1970 the No. 3
shaft will have taken over fully (since
it has the capacity and all the required
facilities). The commissioning of this
new shaft has permitted Norths’ ore
treatment rate to increase from the
360,000 tons p.a. level of the 1960/62
period to the current capacity level of
500,000 tons p.a. The No. 3 shaft is
now being deepened to more than 5000
feet.

Zinc % 12.02 12.62 12.48 11.59 10.86
Although the future mine life based
on published ore reserves and current
production rate is less than nine years,
indicated ore reserves suggest a mine
life expectancy of at least another 25
years, and it is believed that the total
mine life is at least 50 years.
The “lower” 1965 and 1966 ore assay
values (which have declined further in
the current financial year) should be
considered in the light of the following
factors. The 1963 chairman’s address
stated that ore mined from No. 3 shaft
was “of consistently higher grade than
from elsewhere” and that “it is con-
sidered that an ore grade of 15 percent
lead should be maintained in the fore-
seeable future because of an increasing
tonnage becoming available from the
new levels where drilling has indicated
a better average grade of ore than on
the levels which provided most of our
output over the past 15 years.” In
reply to a shareholder’s question at the
1965 annual general meeting, the chair-
man said there was “no real signific-
ance” in the decrease in the lead and
zinc assay value of ore treated in the
1964 and 1965 years. Consequently, it
is likely that the assay value of ore to
be treated in the next few years will
recover from the low values recorded
recently. This should enable Norths to
offset any tendency for lead and zinc
prices to weaken further.

mine was emphasised in the company’s
1963 chairman’s address when, in a
since widely publicised statement, the
chairman remarked that: “Ten years
ago lead at £7ostg. a ton and zinc at
£Bostg. would have looked very low
prices to us. The fact that today they
are reasonably remunerative is because
we have available to us at No. 3 shaft
a very well-equipped mine, a very rich
ore body, and an experienced work force
and staff able to make good use of it.”
As the 1962/63 “mine surplus” of
nearly $l.B million (or 10 cents per
share) was achieved despite realised
prices for lead and zinc combined
being some 18 percent below the “rea-
sonably remunerative” prices mentioned
above (though aided by ore assay values
being the highest since 1946), it can
safely be assumed that on the 12 percent
higher ore treatment rate now available,
and the cost economies due to the No.
3 shaft, the “mine surplus” in future
years will not fall below 15 cents
per share (provided lead/zinc prices
combined currently about $460
don’t fall below the $375 “reasonably
remunerative” level, and provided ore
grades recover to around the assay
values recorded in 1962/63). It should
be noted, however, that an increase of
20 percent in the silver price would
provide Norths with additional revenue
of about 4 cents per share.
On the exploration side, Norths have
stepped up their rate of expenditure in
recent years as the following schedule
indicates. (Prior to 1962/63 the com-
pany’s resources were concentrated on
its No. 3 shaft development.)
Outside Exploration expenditure has
been: 1961-2 $100,448; 1962-3 $202,520;
1963-4 $293,694; 1964-5 $390,526;
1965-6 $535,376.
In conclusion, it would appear that
because of the low break-even point of
Norths’ mine and the company’s sub-
stantial investment income the present
25 cents per share dividend rate is not
in jeopardy. Indeed, as there is the
prospect that the investment portfolio
will return this figure in the early 19705,
shareholders can look forward to the
prospect of higher dividends in the
medium term. At current prices, then,
Norths are still quite attractively priced,
and there is the added speculative in-
terest due to the company’s accelerating
“outside exploration” expenditure.

Behind the balance sheets
Fairymead still faces problems
ON THE FACE of it, Bundaberg’s
Fairymead Sugar Co. Ltd. should be
doing a bit better this year, now that
sugar prices both at home and over-
seas are a little better, now that the
drought is a thing of the past (too
much rain at harvest time is the latest
worry), and now that its unprofitable
subsidiaries should be over the worst.
But the company has a long row to
hoe before it gets back to levels of pro-
fitability that would support a share
price very much higher than the pre-
sent $1.40. And behind the scenes
lurks the threat to the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement that would come with
British membership of the Common
Market.
The Australian industry is now suf-
fering from the over-optimism and
over-expansion generated by world
sugar prices of three or four years ago
which were nearly five times as high
as they are now. The one-third of
Australian sugar output which is sold
on the open market has had to stand
the shock of retreat from a peak
£stglo3 a ton in November, 1963, to
£stgl2 a ton in January, 1967. They
have since recovered—but not much.
Queensland and Federal Govern-
ment action in raising the wholesale
price of sugar by 15 percent has les-
sened the producers’ problems at the
cost of the Australian consumer. Those
sugar millers who grow cane themselves
will benefit. Fairymead Sugar grows
something like 30 percent of the cane
it mills.
Despite poor prices, Fairymead was
able to show a profit on its sugar opera-
tions for 1966, producing 77,000 tons
of sugar from a record crushing of
570,000 tons (35 percent upon previous
best), and this was a record for all
southern Queensland mills. The com-
pany’s sugar profit was increased by
directors’ decision to value sugar at the
end of the year to December at a figure
more “realistic” relative to the estimated
final price, taking into account the
changed circumstances regarding mar-
keting of export sugar, but they did
not say by how much. So it looks as
if Fairymead’s initial profit from group
trading, before depreciation and other
charges, of $541,590 compared with the
previous loss of $2OBB (when the com-
pany was severely affected by drought)
is after putting the best possible
interpretation on stocks.
The net final group profit of
$256,195 compares with the previous
group loss of $355,468, and wms after
nominal tax (1965, $34,542), but after
greatly increased depreciation.
In the past, Fairymead’s diversifica-
tions into other activities had been
seen as an advantage in lessening the
company’s dependence on sugar. How-
ever, one disturbing feature is that the
1966 group profit included $132,172,
being minority stockholders’ contribu-
tion (40 percent) to the losses of sub-
sidiary companies. The subsidiary’s or
subsidiaries’ losses were thus of the
order of $330,000 last year. Up to mid-
-1965, the subsidiaries comprised stock
feed and pastoral companies which
could be integrated with the sugar
business, and it was generally assumed
they were mostly profitable. But
closer examination of parent versus
group accounts reveals that the parent’s
profit in 1964 exceeded the group’s by
about $70,000, and the group’s loss
in 1965 exceeded the parent’s by about
$llO,OOO. Without the millstone of the
subsidiaries in 1966 the company
would have done twice as well. The
parent’s profit of $523,000 was a res-
pectable 16 percent on capital.
Croydon and Marlborough cattle
stations both made a profit in 1966, but
Chillagoe was reported to suffer a small
loss as a result of drought. Of course,
when results are marginal, it is possible

to show a profit or a loss, depending
whether capital costs are written off as
expenses, or on how livestock is
valued. In June, 1965, Fairymead
acquired a majority interest in a manu-
facturer of cane harvesters, cane
loaders, and agricultural machinery,
Masterbilt Pty. Ltd. having a different
balance date to Fairymead, Masterbilt’s
trading contributed to the group’s trad-
ing results for the first time with
results for 18 months to December,
1966. Problems with Masterbilt were
unforeseen by Fairymead management,
and the company operated at a loss,
directors admitted briefly in their
report accompanying the 1966 accounts.
Fairymead has always been a leader
in mechanical harvesting, and in 1966
harvested 75 percent of its crop and
loaded 92 percent mechanically. In
the industry generally, mechanical har-
vesting has increased from 9 percent
in 1962 to 43 percent in 1966, so it
is far from universally accepted, for
reasons of economy, terrain, and so on.
During the boom of 1964-65, there was
a fresh approach to mechanical harvest-
ing and bulk handling, but with sugar
prices where they are today it is under-
standable that there is little interest by
other producers in further capital ex-
penditure, even if funds were available.
The immediate outlook for this sub-
sidiary, therefore, does not look very
bright.
Fairymead will begin 1967 harvesting
this week, and the forecast is a crush-
ing of 570,000 tons, the same as for
1966. Use of a diffuser yielded 97 per-
cent extraction overall in 1966. This
diffuser, the world’s largest and the only
one used in the Australian sugar in-
dustry, has attracted much attention.
Designed by Fairymead, it was built
by the Bundaberg Foundry, owned by
Bundeng Ltd. in which Fairymead is
a large shareholder. This shareholding
probably accounts for most of the listed
investments valued in 1966 accounts at
$141,453, but worth at balance date
barely half that figure on the market.
Fairymead’s 1966 accounts suffer
from some degree of ossification. With
sl.3m. extra invested in gross fixed
assets (at $13.3m.), nearly $300,000
more in stores ($707,000) and trade
debtors $Bll,OOO higher at s2m., in-
debtedness to trade creditors had to be
extended by $738,000 (to $1.16m.) and
to bankers by $1,350,000 to $4.3m.,
which, to give an idea of size, is slm.
more than issued capital.
The Windermere irrigation project
to grow cotton, maize, and sorghum
at Warren, N.S.W., was successfully
developed, but as the granting of water
licences was conditional on subdivision
within five years, the company decided
to sell to an American-controlled firm
at a price believed to exceed slm., a
welcome contribution to liquidity.
No major plant additions were to be
undertaken for the 1967 season, and
provided the crops avoid cyclone dam-
age prospects of profit improvement
on 1966 figures are good for the parent.
What happens to the Masterbilt sub-
sidiary in this current year is a big
query. The company made a one-for-
one bonus in 1960, and since then there
has been a placement and share split.
There is virtually no reliance on loan
funds, except the use of extensive bank
credit.
Irrigation saved Fairymead in 1965
from the full effects of drought, but
even so a loss was recorded, the first
for at least 36 years. That crop was
reduced to 360,000 tons v which, at the
then price levels, was insufficient to
produce a profit. Dividend was halved
to six percent, paid out of dividend
equalisation reserve. This reserve now
stands at $522,000, sufficient to main-
tain a six percent rate for 2-| years
more, but 1966 earning rate of 7.7 per-
cent allowed payment of the reduced
rate out of profits.
With restoration of the 12
dividend still looking a couple of sea-
sons off, given the most favorable cir-
cumstances and with so many uncer-
tainties still surrounding the world
sugar situation, there seems no reason
to rush into this stock despite the latest
local price rise for sugar.

The sum of the parts at CRA
THE GLARING DISCREPANCY be-
tween the cost of participating in the
CRA group’s exploration program by
purchasing New Broken Hill shares in-
stead of CRA shares itself poses
some interesting questions of arithmetic.
New Broken Hill has a much smaller
capital than Conzinc Riotinto of Aus-
tralia (14.6 million against 79.4 million
shares), and has a one-third interest in
CRA’s exploration. Hence the share-
holders of New Broken Hill have a
stake some two and a half times as large
as that of CRA shareholders in the
successful outcome of such ventures as
the Bougainville copper investigation
and the Widgiemooltha nickel drilling
being carried out in conjunction with
Anaconda. And this is without taking
into account the difference between the
market prices of the two stocks, which
accentuates matters still further.
Does this make CRA shares too
highly priced? For every 100 CRA
shares, worth a total of $BOO, there is
an underlying “asset backing” stemming
from CRA’s holdings of shares of
68 Hamersley Holdings shares worth
$340, 12 Interstate Oil shares worth
$l2, 3| Mary Kathleen Uranium shares
worth $l6, and almost 6 New Broken
Hill shares worth $43. This gives a total
of $4ll, leaving about another $390 to
take account of CRA’s interests in
Comalco Pty. Limited (50 percent
owned), Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Limited (50 percent
owned), its 23 percent interest in Cobar
Mines Pty. Limited, an 8 percent inter-
est in Queensland Alumina Limited, a
75 percent interest in Sulphide Cor-
poration Pty. Limited, Titanium and
Zircon Industries Pty. Limited (100
percent owned), and The Zinc Cor-
poration Limited (100 percent owned),
as well as all its other subsidiary and
associated companies.
Assuming that an interest in these
other companies is worth acquiring,
how much per CRA share do they
represent? In the case of some of these
companies the question is fairly simply
resolved; The Zinc Corporation would
compare fairly well with New Broken
Hill in terms of ore throughput and
metal production, and it would not be
unreasonable to value this operation at
a level which compares with the value
of New Broken Hill before that com-
pany’s recent market rise following
heightened interests in CRA’s explora-
tion activities. A conservative valuation
of $4 per New Broken Hill share would
give Zinc Corporation a value of $58.6
million, or some 75 cents per CRA
share.
The interests in lead and zinc smelt-
ing via the 50 percent and 75 percent
shareholdings in Broken Hill Associated
Smelters and Sulphide Corporation res-
pectively, could be given a value of at
least ten times the amount these activi-
ties contributed to group profits last
year, and on this basis, which seems
very reasonable, a further $24 million,
or 30 cents per share, can be added to
the “asset backing” of CRA.
Although it received only $1,200,000
from aluminium last year, CRA appears
likely to receive much larger dividends
in future years from its investment in
Comalco Pty. Limited, and its invest-
ment in this company could be worth
perhaps $5O million. This would add a
further $6O per 100 CRA shares, or
60 cents per share.
The valuation so far totals $576 per
100 CRA shares and the nickel strike
at Widgiemooltha added about another
$23 (CRA shares have risen about $2.30
since before this strike), making a value
of $599. The balance of $2.01 per share
is left to take account of the company’s
other operations, including beach sands,
brickmaking, chemicals and fertilisers,
copper mining, etc. On the 79.4 million
CRA shares issued, this balance seems
rather large at $l6O million, as these
other activities earned only $1.7 million
last year. Cash and short-term loans,
including Government securities at
30th December last, would account for
$3O million. These two items could be
given a value of perhaps $5O million;
leaving $llO million, or $1.40 per share,
to cover such things as Bougainville and
Coppermine Island, as well as leaving
some margin of erfor in the overall
valuation for such investments as Com-
alco Pty. Limited and Queensland
Alumina Limited. At $B, with $6.60
accounted for in the above valuation,
CRA shares appear fairly reasonably
priced, albeit containing about $2.30 for
nickel speculation.
But is the purchase of CRA shares
the best way to acquire a stake in
developments like Widgiemooltha and
Bougainville? If this is the object of
investment, it is clear that New Broken
Hill shares offer a much more attrac-
tive proposition. If eventual earnings
from the exploitation of the copper
deposits on Bougainville amounted to
say, $lO million, New Broken Hill
would receive the equivalent of almost
23 cents per share, while CRA would
receive slightly more than 8 cents per
share. And, in the interim, New Broken
Hill shareholders would be receiving a
dividend of 38 cents per share against
the 8 cents per share being paid by
CRA.
In fact, if the attraction of CRA
shares lies in the future rather than in
established operations such as Zinc
Corporation, Sulphide Corporation,
Broken Hill Associated Smelters, Green-
leaf Fertilisers, etc., then it may be
worth considering more direct vehicles
than the omnibus-type of investment
that CRA offers. Looking on the bright-
est side, the future may bring better
results from beach sands mining, a
renewal of uranium mining, an interest
in a nickel mine, development of very
large low-grade copper deposits, in-
creasing profits from the export of
iron ore, and even, it may be hoped, a
share in an oilfield, as well as the more
mundane prospect of long-term improve-
ment in base-metal prices. Rather than
leave half of their investment in the
present, investors interested in the
future could find it more attractive to
spread their money over a group of
stocks giving a more direct interest in
such developments.
A spread of shares in companies like
Interstate Oil, Kathleen Investments,
New Broken Hill, and Hamersley Hold-
ings would provide a greater stake in
the future of each type of mineral
development. For example, the $BOOO
which 1000 CRA would cost would also
provide sufficient funds for the purchase
of 500 Hamersley, 200 Interstate Oil,
1000 Kathleen Investments, and 300
New Broken Hill.

Better outlook for

prices for Australian growers has

clear away the huge surpluses that have

have been given an unexpected boost
by the weather. The Liverpool (U.K.)
quote for 1 inch middling cotton has

kets. At the same time, however, the
U.S. Government took a hard line with
its own growers and cut the aid they
were receiving.
As a result the world’s largest source
of cotton drastically reduced output in
1966-67. Reflecting this, total world
production dipped 6 million bales to 47
million bales lowest since 1961-62.
Now the U.S. crop for this season has
got off to what has been described as
its worst start since World War 11.
With most of the useful cotton sold
from American stocks, the world mar-
ket is bound to feel the effects of any
production fall. Also harvesting and
marketing of the Syrian crop could be
slowed by the Middle East crisis.
Latest consumption estimates indicate
a lift of 1 million bales in 1966-67, to
52 million bales compared with a
trough of 45 million bales in 1962-63.
European demand is not buoyant, but
in Africa and Asia consumption is
generally gaining. Although cotton,
much more than wool, up to now, has
lost markets to synthetics, the outlook
in the future is for a better market.
The Liverpool quote for lin.
middling is the basis for Australian
prices, with growers also receiving a
bounty—which is limited to a total
payment of $4 million. The stage has
almost been reached where exporting at
market prices will be a growing factor.
ALCAN, A LEADING supplier of
aluminium to world markets, has de-
cided to cut back its production growth
for 1967 to 79,000 tons, instead of
133,000 tons. Two Canadian smelters,
with total capacity of 54,000 tons a
year, are to be taken out of production.
Alcan’s production in 1967 will be
about 867,000 tons, compared with
788,000 in 1966 —an 11 percent rise.
World output of the metal is running
at more than 10 percent above year-
ago levels. Consumption, on the other
hand, has recently levelled out. In
Britain, not a buoyant market at the
best of times, usage fell 15 percent in
the first four months of 1967, to about
108,000 tons.
Certainly there are signs of over-
capacity in even the best of markets,
including the U.S., where the price
rises of earlier this year have not
“taken.” Programs to increase pro-
ductive capacity are nevertheless going
ahead at full speed, despite the general
weakening in industrial conditions in
most nations, because such large
developments are long-term projects.
THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE
has so far been little moved by poli-
tical unrest in Bolivia, centred on tin
mines, one of which was declared by
the miners to be outside the laws of the
country.
At present tin buyers can afford to
yiew the disturbances as of no pressing
importance, for there is a world-wide
surplus of the metal. However, supplies
are not so readily available as to be
able to fill the gap should a significant
Part of Bolivian production be lost for
a prolonged period.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
The all ordinaries index reached its highest peak for 1957
cn June 21, Mineral discoveries, gas and oil strikes have helped
the move in the ordinaries index to ten percent above its posi-
tion this time last year. BHP rose to a new peak on the final day
of the financial year. Western Mining’s nickel production report
shook the nickel speculators from their temporary lull. Even
Thiess was infected by nickel rumors and touched $1.84. Two
newcomers to the lists, Kiwi and Cockburn Cement pro-
vided early profits for stags of 45 percent and 25 percent res
pectively.

LeCouteur: countering reckless
propaganda on wool
IT IS NOT SURPRISING that Mr.
G. S. LeCouteur should write a book
on the wool industry. Nor is it surpris-
ing that, on his very first page, he says
that it is time someone wrote a book
to counterbalance the weight of reck-
less propaganda advocating drastic
marketing change and which, largely,
has been the work of “well-intentioned
amateurs.” However it is very surpris-
ing to find LeCouteur striking a
moderate, middle course on promotion
and research.
At the time of the 1965 marketing
referendum in the wool industry one
gathered the impression that Mr. Le-
Coutem and his friends were hawks;
that they would be happy to see the
Wool Board, the International Wool
Secretariat, and the various bureaucratic
appurtenances of both, eliminated. It
is possible, of course, that in those bitter
days there simply was not the time for
discussion of issues other than the para-
mount one—marketing.
There is much to wool besides
marketing, important as that is, and in
“Wool. Modern Myths: New Horizons”
(Cheshire, $4.75) LeCouteur examines
aspects pushed out of sight in 1965.
He has not attempted to write a history
of the marketing issue (which is a pity
in a way); nor has he enlivened his
book with discussion of wool person-
alities.
As the most able spokesman for the
Committee for the Retention and
Improvement of the Free Wool Market
in 1965 Mr. LeCouteur emerged as a
speaker with a quite devastating turn
of phrase and a dry sense of humor.
Whatever the reason, this side of his
past is not apparent in his book. He
may, as a broker (he is general manager
of Australian Mercantile Land and
Finance Co. Ltd.), feel that he got into
the ring in 1965 under unusual and
exceptional circumstances which are
unlikely to be repeated. This does not
detract from the book he has written—
only the one he might have written were
he not general manager of a broking
firm.
The responsible woolgrower, dis-
mayed by the disunity in the industry,
will be at a disadvantage unless he reads
this book. He may not agree with all
of it but he will be lacking in his appre-
ciation of current trends in wool unless
he does read LeCouteur.
It is fairly obvious that the general
view of the wool horizon—as seen by
LeCouteur—coincides with the general
view of several policy-makers in both
the Wool Industry Conference and the
Federal Government. It is therefore
likely that what LeCouteur says
OUGHT to be the policy will, in fact,
BE the policy.
The essential argument in support of
a free market is that the woolgrower
cannot dictate the price which the
world will pay for his wool. LeCouteur
develops this theme (which can hardly
be denied) and stresses that subsidies
are merely palliatives which put off the
day of reckoning. The current buying-
in of wool in New Zealand under their
reserve price scheme and the now dis-
banded U.S. cotton reserve price system
serve as useful reminders to those who
believe the grower can dictate his price.
To return profitability in wool-
growing to 1950 levels, the price of
wool today would have to double. There
is little hope of that happening. Lower
tariffs, he suggests, are one way to
reduce production costs. However,
here again he strikes a middle course
and stresses that protection, in the case
of some industries, is justified.
This is pretty much in line with the
stated tariff policies of the N.S.W.
Graziers’ Association, the country’s most
powerful single woolgrower organisa-
tion.
The majority of woolgrowers are, by
nature, conservative and responsible.
LeCouteur’s adaptive approach to profi-
tability taking in shipping, manage-
ment, promotion, research, and market-
ing—remains conservative and respon-
sible. An absorbing, but not. conten-
tious, section of his book deals with
marketing methods in South America,
the United States, New Zealand, South
Africa, and the U.K.
On promotion and research
LeCouteur supports an improved and
continuing program on pretty much the
same terms as already exist. He
applauds the Woolmark campaign,
which, he says, was introduced “just in
time.” He seeks a better “feed back
of research information to woolgrowers.
The introduction, by Professor K. G.
Campbell, might well have been ex-
panded, and if there is a reprint this
could be a thought for the publishers.
Campbell has the touch of fire which
LeCouteur evidently feels himself
unable to provide, and which, from the
viewpoint of readability (if not accepta-
bility), might have resulted in this boo'
reaching a far wider public than t e

Sheep: "We are
just good mates"
BIOLOGISTS AT THE CSIRO
Animal Research Laboratory, Prospect,
N.S.W., have announced the results of
intimate observations on the mating
behaviour of sheep Among a mass of
absorbing findings perhaps the one of
greatest practical importance to sheep
farmers is that the joining rate could
be reduced. Only one ram is needed
for every hundred ewes provided he is
an active fellow and that the paddock
is not too large.
The Prospect study was conducted in
a paddock with flocks of up
to 200 merino sheep. Other studies else-
where involving British breeds have told
a comparable story. Much higher join-
ing rates have been favored by most
sheepmen in Australia up till now. They
may have been wasting money and re-
tarding flock improvements by pur-
suing this policy needlessly. Better to
put all the money available into buying
a few really good rams rather than to
spend it on several with less desirable
traits. That, at any rate, appears to be
one practical conclusion to draw from
the Prospect announcements.
The Australian sheep industry has
reached a crucial stage in its history.
At the moment flock numbers and
quality need to be lifted together as
quickly as possible at the lowest ex-
pense possible. Reproduction by a
system involving the smallest number,
More lambs... fewer rams
but the most superior of rams would
permit quality to be raised most rapidly
providing, of course, the number of ewes
impregnated was not reduced. The
results at Prospect point to the pos-
sibility of developing such a system on
the farms. In many areas, for example,
it should be possible to join the ewes
in relatively small paddocks.
Unfortunately, there is a marked tend-
ency toward bumbledom in getting
broad, general findings such as this
adapted to suit the requirements of
commercial farming in the different
regions of Australia. It is to be hoped
that the appropriate authorities will lose
no time in exploring the implications
and practical opportunities for using
fewer rams.
Reverting to the proviso that the ram
be “active” it should be explained that
the observation team found that some
rams will serve only eight ewes a day
whereas other rams of the same age
will serve 38 under the same conditions.
From this it would seem that rams
should be given some sort of a vigor
rating and priced accordingly. A ram’s

value after all is not intrinsic but
extrinsic being expressed in the number
and quality of his get.
Keenness to copulate was in fact
found to be very variable for no appar-
ent reason. An important next step
would be to ascertain whether this char-
acteristic is strongly inherited, like
fleece weight, for example. Even when
the most active rams performed up to
40 services a day the sperm content of
their semen did not fall below the mini-
mum required to achieve conception
in most ewes.
Bossiness was also studied. Contrary
to what one might suppose, the number
of sexual contacts made by the dom-
inated ram was almost entirely of his
own choosing. If he was of the active
type he got as many ewes as the
master. The latter’s status does, how-
ever, carry its own reward. The ewes
as they come on to heat foresake the
main flock and cluster around the boss
ram to provide him with a harem, so
to speak. The inferior ram must make
his own opportunities. Presumably he
finds them while the ewes are drifting
toward the harem or to rejoin the main
flock. In a very small paddock the
dominant ram is able to assert his
authority and get a greater share of
the ewes offering. His lesser fellows do
not have enough room to manoeuvre
under these circumstances.
The fact that the ewes actively seek
out the ram is also interesting. Professor
Robinson, of Sydney University, first
demonstrated this phenomenon some
years ago. He tethered a ram in the
middle of a large paddock and found
that a large proportion of the ewes
became pregnant nevertheless. Emphasis
in the past has been put on selecting
rams for their feet and free gait. Less
attention could be given to these points
in future.
Multiple serving of ewes seems waste-
ful, but at Prospect it resulted in a few
extra ewes becoming pregnant. When
only one ram was run with 200 ewes
25 percent were served only once, but
this figure was halved when two rams
were present. By slaughtering ewes at
intervals after mating and examining
the genital tract it was found that eggs
are fertilised in over 90 percent of the
ewes, but a serious number do not
develop further. In one of the flocks
only 76 percent of the ewes that mated
were pregnant three weeks later. In
another, the pregnancy rate was rather
better being 86 percent after one month
and 84.5 percent after two months.
Possibly from listening to the talk of
shepherds “under the hawthorn in the
dale,” Shakespeare acquired some
appreciation of the mating behaviour of
sheep and the problems their habits
created for the husbandman. He wrote:
“My flocks feed not,
My ewes breed not,
My rams speed not,
All is amiss.”

Immediately after her marriage Mrs.
Rod Carnegie went to live in New
York for three years. She thinks that
this period of her life made her self-
reliant and was a tremendous stimulant
for efficiency. The high standards set
oy American women when running their
homes plus, in some cases, careers
seemed to her incredible.
, Mrs. Carnegie says she was always
mterested in the arts, but says that it
her mother-in-law, Mrs. Douglas
harnegie, the well-known patron and
collector, who has helped her to develop
a ect; ive and intelligent interest.
Ihe young Carnegies are slowly
udding up their own collection of
Australian paintings, and their beach-
house with views of Melbourne’s Port
hulio Bay, which was completed only
ten days before these pictures were
taken, has several lovely paintings. How-
ever, their main collection is housed in
town. This small holiday house is a
perfect example of time and motion in
planning and is built for relaxed sum-
mer living. There are no clocks in the
house! It was designed by David
McGlashen.
All the wood used in the construction
of this house is pinus radiata, which has
been treated in order to make it main-
tenance-free indefinitely. Canvas ceil-
ings in place of plaster have been used
throughout. Knobs and catches on
cupboard doors have been replaced by
leather tabs.
The beach-house is strictly modern in
furnishings but Mrs. Carnegie’s other
house combines beautiful antiques,
Painting, “Figure,” by Charles Black-
man, from the collection of Mr. and
Mrs. Rod Carnegie


Living-room has poured-cement floors with a pebble surface, and is covered with
straw matting. Japanese wicker blinds in deep green protect the room from glare
modern paintings, and flower arrange-
ments against stark white walls with no
curtains anywhere. This gives a most
beautiful illusion of space and lightness.
Mrs. Carnegie was formerly Carmen
Clarke. She says that she learnt to
appreciate good food and how to
manage it from her mother. At Devon
Park, her parents’ home, they had an
enormous vegetable garden; she says,
“We always ate in season.” No
asparagus in February!
She does her fruit and vegetable shop-
ping at' Prahran markets and likes the
feeling of being the provider of plenty
in a house stocked with good food.
When she gets home from the markets
she likes to spread her purchases
around the kitchen to admire before
she puts them away.
The Carnegies like to ask a few
friends in for casual drinks and chicken
sandwiches, but abhor large cocktail
parties. They like to entertain at dinner.
Eight is Mrs. Carnegie’s favorite
number. She is a superb and original
cook and with disciplined planning be-
forehand is serene and confident with
her guests.
She manages her parties without out-
side help and puts the dishes in the
dishwashing machine and the pots in
the oven till the morning. I give her top
marks for this. It is an idea a lot of
frenetic hostesses could well copy.
They ask their guests for 7.30 for
dinner at 8 o’clock and the guests are
asked to help themselves. No hors-
d’oeuvre to spoil the meal. Mr. Car-
negie often mixes a cocktail, but they
themselves often start with a glass of
the wine they intend to drink later.
The menus with this article are de-
signed for summer entertaining and
illustrate Derfectly Mrs. Carnegie’s
talent for the simple but perfect meal.

Foreign policy... all the way
from Evatt to Menzies
By DONALD HORNE
The evolution of Australian foreign
policy, 1938-1965. Alan Watt. Cam-
bridge University Press. $6.
WHEN SIR ALAN WATT set out to
write an account of how Australia had
grown up from being, so far as foreign
policy was concerned, a non-nation 30
years ago he had both a strong advan-
tage and a strong disadvantage. His
advantage was that as a member of the
External Affairs Department for 25
years and its head for three of them he
knew more about what was going on
behind the scenes than others who had
written on this subject. His disadvantage
was that the restrictions applicable to
all Australian officials meant that he
could not speak freely from his per-
sonal knowledge.
However, he got out of this dilemma
adequately. His private knowledge led
him to know what was significant: then
he examined the public record and
found that a surprising amount of this
had already become public so that
(although he has had to deliberately not
say some things) from using public
sources he was able to get most of it
down in what is likely to remain for
some time the best straight history of
Australian diplomacy in the Evatt and
Menzies periods. This is not to say
that more interpretative accounts are
impossible.
Although circumstances were pushing
Australia into independent diplomacy
for a couple of years before Dr. Evatt
arrived, Evatt was undoubtedly the
rocket who lit up the scene. He was the
kind of man who could give events
a push. Watt shows him as a limelighter
delighting in power, pushy, and almost
friendless, making a reputation for him-
self in the classic sense, driving and
obsessive. Although he gives a range
of views about Evatt’s influence in the
two fields in which Evatt tried hardest
in getting more support for the
Pacific War and then in improving the
United Nations —Watt seems inclined
toward seeing Evatt’s achievements in
these two fields as not being as great
as, at the time, they sounded, making
the additional criticisms that Evatt’s
fireworks diplomacy loosened Australia’s
connection with the U.S.A. toward the
end of the 1940 s and blinded him to
the toughness of Stalin’s postwar
policies.
This is, of course, the Hasluck and
very largely the Departmental view.
However, when stated in its most ex-
treme forms (quoted by Watt, but not
necessarily supported by him) it is a
type of criticism that could also be
applied to some of the great diplo-
mats in history. Evatt was a familiar
enough type: he sought excitement in
action and he sought glory for himself
and his nation. Whether history sees
such a person as a good or a bad
statesman depends on the causes he
served, on the style with which he
served them, and on the results of his
actions (three different matters which
rarely come together as all being suc-
cessful): it does not depend on the
personality-type he represents. When
Mr. Hasluck made his now famous
attacks on Evatt what he was “really”
saying was not that Evatt was a bad
diplomat but that Evatt had the kind
of style he did not like.
Australian policy went through a
heady “new emerging force” period
under Evatt aggressively nationalist
in style and aggressively internationalist
in substance. We should remember that
such a stage might recur and that the
impetuosity of an Evatt can be as much
part of our political life as the scep-
ticism of a Menzies.
Watt gives a particularly favorable
view of Sir Percy Spender’s 15 months
as External Affairs Minister. The pub-
lic boredom of the latter part of the
“Age of Menzies” makes one forget
how forceful and active Australian
foreign policy was in the early 19505.
Spender’s main mistake was the bump-
tiousness of his approach to the Indon-
esians which undid, in one go, one of
the real benefits of policy under Evatt
(although in this case the policy may
have been more Chifley’s and the De-
partment’s than Evatt’s). However,
Spender has to his credit a reversal of
policy toward.the United States, seek-
ing to find with America the same re-
lation as Australia enjoyed with Brit-
ain; it was under Spender that the
basic work for the ANZUS pact was
done. At the same time most of the
initiative for the Colombo Plan can
also be credited to Spender. To have
been so strongly connected with two
Evatt... glory for self and nation
Spender ... ANZUS and Colombo plan
Casey... effective, personal symbol


of the most significant symbols of Aus-
tralian policy as ANZUS and the
Colombo Plan a combination of
special relations with both the U.S.A.
and Asia gives Spender a signifi-
cance that cannot be forgotten. Nor,
presumably, will it be forgotten that
this was the. period when Watt was
head of the External Affairs Depart-
ment.
The sense of initiative and drive con-
tinued for a while under Casey. This
was the time of the conclusion of
ANZUS, the founding of SEATO, and
of the mysterious ANZAM agreement
between Australia, New Zealand, and
Britain (which Watt sorts out), but
Casey’s special contribution to it was
that he became the first effective per-
sonal symbol of what has now become
the cliche of “Australia’s growing
awareness of Asia.” Watt sees Casey as
a man who gained more from meeting
people than from reading reports (per-
haps the present. Prime Minister is also
developing his foreign policy in this
way) and for this reason he believes
that it was not previous conviction but
Casey’s personal visits to countries in
Asia that enlivened his imagination and
led him to that strengthening of Aus-
tralian diplomatic representation in the
area that now means that among the
diplomats of South and South-East Asia
ours take some beating.
Then things slowed down. It is one
of the themes of Watt’s book that Aus-
tralian foreign policy, in the latter part
of the “Age of Menzies,” became rigid,
and secret. He produces Sir Garfield
Barwick as an exception, but does not
put up much of a case for him. He
suggests that Barwick had bad luck in
being caught between Sukarno’s two
Confrontations, but since one of the
tests of a Foreign Minister is how he
handles crises, this seems no excuse.
Even less convincing is the plea that
Barwick had only two years in the job,
that' he didn’t really have time to get
a feeling for it; yet, as Watt points out,
Menzies... British wisdom and
American power
Spender had only 15 months. Watt
realises Barwick’s greatest weakness:
that Barwick was inclined to over-
estimate the role that can be played by
the skill of pure diplomacy, unrelated
to military or economic strength. This
seems typical of the weakness of a
lawyer in politics: that he sees his role
as mainly that of stating a case. This
also led, of course, to the best in Bar-
wick—that he was interested in public
opinion, and wanted to inform it. He
was somewhat hampered in this, how-
ever, as Watt points out, by his distrust
of the Press.
Watt does not deal specifically with
the period in which Sir Robert Menzies
combined External Affairs with his
Prime Ministership, but he seems to see
the shadow of Menzies looming so large
over foreign policy, in the late ’sos and
the early ’6os, that Watt’s criticisms of
the rigidities of that policy must be
taken largely as a criticism of Menzies,
who set as slow a pace for the past ten
years of his rule as, in the ’4os, Evatt
set a quick one.
In this ten years Watt sees a rigidity
in diplomatic, defence, immigration,
and foreign aid policies that was shaken
Barwick... the skill of pure diplomacy
only by attacks from minority groups
outside both Government and Parlia-
ment. A sense of initiative lay not in
Cabinet but in sections of the com-
munity. It was from outside the Gov-
ernment that changes in defence policy,
for instance, were first discussed. The
central beam of this rigid structure,
according to Watt, may have been
Menzies’ lack of interest in the future,
combined with his view that what
mattered was that “British wisdom sup-
ported by American power should be
supreme.”
Watt also draws attention, in par-
ticular, to the desire not ever to criticise
publicly a great and powerful friend.
He is worth quoting at length on this:
“. . . this attitude deprives those who
differ fi;om their own Government’s
policies of the encouragement and
stimulus of knowing that others share
their views. It also deprives Australian
Hasluck... style of silence
public opinion of precise knowledge of
its Government’s attitude to some inter-
national problems, and makes it appear
to Communist and many Afro-Asian
nations that Australia is merely an
American ‘stooge’—an impression likely
to be greatly strengthened by Mr.
Harold Holt’s unfortunate use of the
Presidential electoral slogan ‘All the
way with LBJ’ during his visit to
Washington in June, 1966. Other
Commonwealth Governments, especially
British Governments, manage by one
method or another, direct or indirect,
to make public their doubts or differ-
ences about certain American policy
without destroying their fundamental
ties with the United States.”
It is in his criticism of its inadequate
preparation of public opinion, along
with its rigidity in policy, that Watt
criticises the Menzies’ style of diplo-
macy, shown most obviously in what
almost seemed indifference to public
opinion during the early period of Aus-
tralian intervention in the Vietnam War.
Here, although the present External
Affairs Minister seems to prefer the style
of silence, there has been improvement.
The External Affairs Department itself
is now active in this field, but what its
officials can do is limited. Yet public
knowledge of foreign policy is one of
the most important functions of foreign
policy. It is more fashionable to see
policy in terms only of self-interest, but
calculations of self-interest often pro-
duce bad results. One can also see
policy as an expression of unselfish
aspiration: telling a nation what it
should be.
This also can aid self-interest, bexause
it is by this means that other nations
can also learn what we would like to be.
As Watt says, in his last sentence: The
world community will judge Australia
not by what it is able to obtain for its
own people by way of creature comforts
and security but by the extent an
significance of the contribution it makes
toward easing burdens on the long)
hard road leading toward peace, justice,
and well-being for mankind.”

American dynasty
By TIMOTHY READ
All in the Family. Edwin O’Connor.
Chatto & Windus. $3.85.
HERE IS ANOTHER fascinating novel
by O’Connor about the rise of an Am-
erican political dynasty. Reading it, one
is reminded again of the great com-
munications gap that exists between the
electors and the elected. American
political history is full of rags-to-riches
stories of families that rise to power.
That hoary old story, of which the
Kennedy family is the most famous
recent example, generally begins with
an impoverished Irish migrant who
makes a fortune by shady means and
ends up manipulating the local political
scene. The birth of sons, however,
brings a new desire for respectability
and so the money and the sons are sent
back into public service. Typically, each
son lives an austere life, attends private
school and college, graduates cum laude
as a lawyer, and has a couple of million
settled on him to free him financially
for the political life. He climbs the
political ladder on promises to reform
corruption and emerges as Governor or
Senator or even as President. The wheel
has turned full circle and respectability,
that essential American virtue, has been
achieved.
Edwin O’Connor’s “All in the
Family” would have been a good book
had it just followed that pattern; in-
deed, for the first three-quarters it does
and is a vivid account of State politics.
But the last quarter takes the story one
stage further, and it is this analysis of
what is happening now in American
politics that gives the book the added
depth of informed comment.
Charles Kinsella, the hero, does rise
to become Governor of his State by
promising to reform the corruption and
graft that his father’s money once sup-
ported. But corruption does not end
with promises to end it; corruption
tends to reappear in another form. It
is Mr. O’Connor’s insight in this book
to see that the form corruption most
often takes in our society today is the
corruption of expediency. A political
machine cannot be turned inside out all
at once; change takes time, ideals are
best implemented slowly, so slowly in
fact that they lose their original iden-
tity.
This analysis of modern politics
would be very dry were it not for Mr.
P Connor’s abilities as a novelist. “All
in the Family” moves irrevocably step
y step to the tragedy, the destruction
°f the Kinsella family, and ends with a
sort of modern harsh justice that will
not please people who fondly imagine
bat there is any honor about politics,
thirdly, there is Mr. O’Connor’s style
Much works much like a stream erod-
lng the heart out of a mountain; it is
Ve ry clear and lucid, there is not much
noise, but it cuts cleanly into its subject
a nd leaves its meaning plain.


Wilder parable
Thornton Wilder ... new gospel
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Eighth Day. Thornton Wilder.
Longmans. $3.85.
WILDER’S FIRST NOVEL in 19
years is a hefty sermon in well-hewn
stone. His main text for our time seems
to be that Creation did not finish with
the seventh day. In some respects, it
was a mere beginning. Life, now and
again, takes a step forward into the
evolution of the “Eighth Day,” but this
apparent progress is the lot of a chosen
few —the unrecognised messiahs.
This idea is the framework for
an unusually treated story set in Coal-
town, a grubby, mid-western mining
village at the deadend of nowhere at
the turn of the century. The two top
families of Coaltown are relaxing in the
garden. John Ashley fires one shot at a
rifle-practice target. His friend Lansing
falls dead. Ashley is tried for murder,
found guilty, and condemned to death.
En route to his execution he disappears
from the face of the earth.
Subjected to all the vicious hostility
of which humans are capable, his family
is victimised and ostracised. But out of
adversity the house of this messiah puts
forth the fruits of genius, and the son
becomes a nationally famous figure in
the newspaper world of Chicago, and
the daughters great singers and reform-
ers. Later, the two houses of the guilt-
less “murderer” and murdered are
joined and in turn produce a son, John,
a miserable specimen the branch is
returning to the average.
Wilder’s technique is first to cut a
piece out of this tapestry, deliberately
leaving the threads to dangle in order
to weave them tidily together as he
traces the source of the mystery and
pieces the fragments into place. Skil-
fully he shows how chance produces
the design of life and a man’s per-
sonality embroiders it with patterns
both good and bad and almost always
ephemeral.
At its best, the writing is super-
charged with an almost unbearable ten-
sion, but for my taste, the parable
could have been allowed to speak a
little more for itself.
Beery thumbnail
By NANCY KEESING
In Search of an Australian. Don Whit-
ington. Lansdowne. $4.25.
WHITINGTON’S field seems no wider
or newer than Donald , Horne’s or Craig
MacGregor’s, and his little digging stick
scratches a good deal shallower than
theirs.
As a way of offering comparisons be-
tween Australians of a past generation
and those of today, Whitington supplies
thumbnail sketches of people from all
over the continent some are from
long-established families, but most are
first-generation of “New” Australians.
The thumbnail is often dipped in beer
Whitington finds the pub a good
place for sociological research, and is
probably right. But Australian pubs
being what they are, women are seldom
interviewed in these pages except as
wives in the background a curious
overall Zenana effect is the result.
In compensation some fascinating
titbits emerge why so many Flinders
Islanders lack finger joints; what hap-
pens at Hunter’s Hill dances; how
“Western Australia ... is moving,
stretching, bursting at the seams.”
Having failed to discover a typical
Australian, Whitington concludes his
investigations at Templestowe in Vic-
toria with this fine rhetorical flourish:
“Here, and in half a hundred, half a
thousand hamlets like it around Aus-
tralia, the iron is being thrust into the
flames to produce a new national type.”
Well, perhaps.
Kylie's "girls"
By FRANK ROBERTS
Ma Jones and the Little White Canni-
bals. Kylie Tennant. Macmillan.
$3.25.
“KYLIE TENNANT HAS NOT only
torn off her label as a serious writer;
she has also, and brilliantly, torn a
strip off all those who take themselves
seriously,” Macmillan’s tell us on the
dust jacket. Publishers’ hyperbole, that.
Neither Ma Jones nor her fictional biog-
rapher (a lawyer) would use such slang.
Ma descends only to sayings like, “Why
give a hen false teeth?” And her
Boswell to such asides as “the most
successful political fixers use charm as
a little boy uses tomato sauce, all over
everything.” Miss Tennant’s alter ego,
the lawyer, jibes but does not tear strips;
which is fitting. She is a well-educated
Australian, unmarried, describable as
one of a bunch of “girls” who admire
Ma Jones for her good heart and good
works.
And she tells us about these in
thirteen tales, linked by her presence
Kylie Tennant ... alkaline remarks
and Ma Jones’. Most of them are
plotted loosely enough to be good-fun
reading for women who can’t be both-
ered with the intricacies of heavily
plotted stories. Ma Jones and her fluffy
friends dart about city and country fix-
ing problems, from tracking down a
missing painter fled to Adelaide to
calming an unnerved Gold Coast tycoon
whose chemist rang about “that arsenic
your wife ordered for you.” While
Ma copes, her Boswell makes alkaline
remarks about the people they meet,
in ladylike prose. But Ma and her
diarist seemed to be tugging against one
another for the limelight, dissipating
the humorous effect.
Naive but fresh
By NANCY KEESING
Tell a Green Man Something. Douglas
Griffin. Leutenegger. $2.75.
THIS novel, privately printed by the
author’s widow, is peculiarly interest-
ing in a way not easy to explain.
The writing is not “primitive” (as
Bellerive’s or Daisy Ashford’s is) but
straightforward and rather abrupt. A
publisher’s note stated that it is part
of a much longer book, but, in itself,
this volume is complete. By any
ordinary standards it is faulty in many
ways, ranging from simple spelling
errors to long catalogues of city detail,
which, by all rules, ought to be tire-
some; and, perhaps because of cutting,
its construction leaves much to be
desired.
The odd thing is that none of this
matters. The plot is an exciting one
concerning espionage and adventure in
Nazi-occupied France where the Aus-
tralian hero, James Brady, works as
a British agent. Perhaps it is the very
naivete, the fresh and unselfconscious
story-telling, which makes this book
seem more authentic and more interest-
ing than the accomplished production
of Bond, Ambler, etc.
If the extraordinary events described
actually happened the book has docu-
mentary value; if Douglas Griffin in-
vented his plot his imaginative powers
were enviable. In either case I hope
his unclassifiable literary achievement
reaches the audience it deserves.

LETTERS
Higham's Sydney
There is a great deal to be said for
Charles Higham’s Sydney article and
something to be said against it. Funda-
mentally, all other comment being
merely secondary to this, Higham is
right—“this is the place to live.” I can
imagine that natural beauty, urban
variety, and a general air of easy-
goingness could surround the citizen of
a San Francisco or a Rome to give the
lift and the feeling of well-being which
Sydney offers—perhaps some smaller
city of Japan does, too. But this is to
establish the most exclusive sort of
league, to allow that in some other
places people may be lucky enough to
live in a Sydney.
Nevertheless, Higham is indiscrim-
inately ecstatic. There is great ugliness
here and it should be named for what
it is, not obscured by a sort of Monet
treatment. The way out to La Perouse
along Anzac Parade must be the most
desolate urban concentration in the
country, for example; while the great
stretches of squint-eyed liver-brick cot-
tages, south and west are the sort of
places that defy the notion of human
potential. I don’t think many Mel-
bourne councils would allow those stark
blood-orange brick blocks of home units
with their cake-icing balconies to erupt
upon places of beauty as they do in
Sydney. Inner areas like Redfern and
Alexandria may have some sort of
"“Mediterranean glamor.” For the most
part they are dreary and depressing
slums, more obviously so than the slums
of other cities, since they all but ring
the central Sydney area.
My second point of criticism is that
Higham determined to ignore what
many people would think is Sydney’s
most distinctive and certainly her most
famous residential area. I mean Pad-
dington, including the older, abutting
areas of Woollahra. It is odd, indeed,
that Higham should cruise out along
New South Head Road without any
apparent awareness of what reared up
on the hill to his right. He mightn’t
like it, but, as your photographer and
myself know, there it most certainly,
ineluctably, is.
Lastly, if Higham fails here to show
something which really, positively is
Sydney, he errs again in the amount of
space spent in describing places which
could be duplicated in any other Aus-
tralian city. Personally, I didn’t come
to Sydney to live the “unpretentious,
peaceful, remote life of Jannali and
Gymea,” but to get away from the
similar life of Nunawading, Beaumaris,
and Highett (where, as Barry
Humphries pointed out, “It’s awfully
quiet”).
It seems to me that Sydney doesn’t
centrally belong to that rather dreary
little nation which is ruled politically
from Canberra and financially from
Melbourne. The great virtue of
Higham’s article is to put Sydney, the
whole splendid jumble of it, in that
international context where it properly
has its place.

P.O: a 1908 idea
I was interested to read Mr. Lucock’s
claim (8., June 24) that he was the
originator of a suggestion that the
Postal Department be removed from
control of the Commonwealth Public
Service Board and established as a
commission.
On June 26, 1908, a Royal Commis-
sion (J. H. Cook, chairman) was
appointed by the House of Representa-
tives to investigate the management of
the Post Office. In its report, tabled on
October 10, 1910, the Commission
recommended that control of the
Department be vested in a Board of
Management and removed from the
control of the Public Service Commis-
sioner.
In addition, Mr. Lucock might find
time to read Gerald Caiden’s “Career
Service” (Melbourne University Press,
1965), where the Commission’s Report
and the reaction of the Public Service
Commissioner are fully discussed.

The Opera House
The people who aim to discredit Utzon
use subtler means now than last year.
But they still bend the truth to suit
their purpose. Thus the writer of your
article “The Last Ditchers” (8.,
May 13) said that Utzon’s big hope,
the Zurich theatre, will now not be
built. The fact is that the Zurich
theatre is going well, as Utzon himself
wrote in a letter to a Sydney friend,
dated June 6, 1967: “Here I am in
Zurich it is going very well fortu-
nately we get some time to prepare the
drawings properly . . .”
Perhaps it is only a minor point, but
it is typical for the methods used
throughout the attack on Utzon and the
Opera House. Anyone who is interested
in the truth of the whole sorry affair
should read Duek-Cohen’s excellent
little book which has been published
since your article appeared.

Arab migrants
The comment by a Canberra immigra-
tion officer (8., June 24), “We don’t
reckon Australians want too many
fellows in nightshirts, or blokes who’d
be liable to drop on to a prayer-mat
in George Street on the stroke of six”
—is astounding!
If the officer was as well informed as
one in such a department should be, he
would know: (a) Not all Arabs are
Moslem, (b) a person walking down
George Street is obviously a traveller
a traveller is exempt from his prayer
at the appointed hour, (c) the time of
daily prayer varies with the seasons,
(d) the “nightshirts” are an excellent
type of dress for the Middle East.
There are approximately 10,000
Moslems in Australia, the majority of
them well assimilated into the com-
munity, living exemplary lives, observ-
ing their duties to God and the State.

More "Seasons"
If Ross Campbell’s preference for
Wolsey over More (8., June 24) is
based on persecution of heretics, he
might cast an eye over the treatment
accorded to Lollards when Wolsey was
in the ascendant. As to popularity,
Campbell’s quotation from Christopher
Morris is somewhat hedging. The fact
is that the divorce, which led directly
to the breach, was most unpopular.
As a great authority on these matters,
Philip Hughes, puts it, “All the law-
making of the spring of 1534 had been
done in an atmosphere heavy with
threats of death ... We are not to
conclude that, because those who
braved the king’s anger were so utterly
insignificant in number, Henry VIII
had on his side any passive goodwill of
the majority. The dispatches of the
envoy of Charles V tell of revolt sim-
mering in every country of the realm,
of great lords coming to him by stealth
with prayers that the Emperor will
send an army to put things right.
From among the people there were two
risings, one in Lincolnshire and a very
serious one in Yorkshire that Pil-
grimage of Grace which timeserving
Norfolk, the king’s general (depicted
all too favorably in “A Man For A 1
Seasons”) knew the royal forces could
not combat by fair means. He tricked
Aske and his men with specious
promises till they disbanded, when he
had the prominent ones hanged.
