THE BED PAGE.
The Thrush is a little better—not so very much.
“The Thrush” —it is an attractive title. “A
Periodical for the Publication of Original Poetry ”
—it is an attractive idea. But the editor, T.
Mullett Ellis, is a rank British ass, seem-
ingly devoid of critical faculty; and his first
volume collects verse which is insipid, colourless,
and little beside. Yet Henley, Arthur Symons,
Nora Hopper, and others of proved mettle con-
tribute. But in every case they seem to have
passed their weakest verses to the undiscriminat-
ing Thrush, with the result that there is not one
really good thing in all ten numbers to date. The
editor is fully endowed with British arrogance, and
his aim i 3
to foster in £he masses an appreciation of poetic ex-
pression ; to nurture beauty in their souls; to elevate
their ideas ; to exalt them to highmindedness, and to
attune their critical faculty and their mental ear to the
reception of all the loveliness that is expressible in
exquisite Song. .
And he proceeds to fill his magazine with his own
execrable compositions, like these lines from a 32-
verse “ballad” on “The Siege of Mafeking.”
The defenders’ hearts were “ sound,” it seems—
Sound — but alas ! too surely our armour was unbuckled ;
The British cannon—old scrap iron, not fit for shooting
buns.
Eight thousand Boers, with Cronje, outspanned and
grinned and chuckled,
With their ammunition ready and Krupp’s great modern
guns.
The rest is as bad or worse. And The Thrush
was destined “to foster in the masses an appre-
ciation of poetic expression ; to nurture beauty in
their souls,” eta ! —and T. Mullett Ellis “passes
on with pity ” when The Saturday Review jibes
The Thrush looks like a private venture, and at
latest it was pleading desperately for public sup-
port. Sometimes the public is singularly wise.
The Muse Misguided.
h
So! there’s no Laureate of Australia
Who may wear the green crown of the gum,
Though scores in her vast penetralia
Take as kindly to rhyme as to rum !
There are poets who ride through the mulga,
Who camp 'neath the gidgea and gum,
And many a one from the Culg’a
Goes westward a-humping his drum.
There's a bard with each big mob of cattle
That comes from the plains of the West;
There are bards where the dryblowers rattle,
And a bard keeps the “ Travellers’ Rest.”
There’s a poet in every region
Who in verse will set everything down,
And yet there’s not one of the legion
Deemed worthy the eucalypt crown 1
So we drink till we get the blue devils,
Till editors turn and abuse, —
For the fear is borne in our revels,
Some rascal has swallowed the Muse f
E.S.S.
The Sweated Newspaper-Man.
WITHIN the last few years, whilst circu-
lations and advertisements of Sydney
newspapers have steadily risen, the
wages of daily-paper employees on the
big daily papers have steadily fallen. The com-
positor, promised princely remuneration if he
submitted quietly to the linotype, finds an average
of £4 or £4 10s. a week hard to maintain ; whereas
in the old days £6 was easily earned. The clerks
in the business department have suffered also from
general retrenchment. But the journalist is the
chief victim of newspaper sweating. A decade ago
the standard wage for a moderately-skilled Sydney
pressman was £6 a week; and salaries ranged
from that to £B, £lO, £l5, and much higher for
special officials. A reporter valued at less than
£6 on a morning paper was a rarity. Now rates
stand at about this level—
Evening paper staff : From nothing a-week (to an im-
prover), by small, painfully small, gradations to from £7
to £lO or £l2 a-week for an editor. Great plentitude of
boy-reporters getting £1 or £1 10s. a-week.
Morning paper staff: From £1 a-week (to the beginner)
to £7 a-week for the tip-top men of the staff ; a few sala-
ries of £8 to £lO for “ officials ” ; up to £2O for an editor.
A typical reporting- staff would be paid thus : Two at £7,
two at £6, two at £5, two at £4 10s., ten more at from £1
to £3 10s.
And there is a strong tendency on most
morning and evening papers to continue to reduce
the number of fairly-salaried men. One paper
which lost three decentlv-paid men within a few
months replaced them all with boys. In fact, the
production of the “ boy reporter ” is now a matter
of business on some of the daily papers. Messen-
ger boys are engaged at from 7s. Gd. to 10s. a
week to carry copy, &c. ; and any showing signs
of smartness are taught shorthand, then drafted
as clerks into one of the business departments.
After a spell there, they are turned on to “the
staff,” beginning with £1 a week, with the pro-
spect (but not the certainty) of small annual
increases.
It would be a fair generalisation to say that the
wage of a senior reporter (required to write short-
hand, 120 words a minute ; to understand enough
of the English language to write a decent paragraph
or report; to dress decently ; to mingle with rich
people so as to “ keep up the reputation of the
office ”; to live so close to the city that he can
walk home after midnight; to be proof always
against the temptation of a proffered “tenner”;
to exercise a skilled judgment as to the compara-
tive value of what he hears at a meeting) is on an
average £4 10s. a week in Sydney—something
iess in Adelaide and Brisbane ; something more in
Melbourne, where the journalist’s wage is the
highest in Australia.
As to the hours of labour, they are almost in-
finite. The sub-editor of one “great daily,”
asked to state for the information of the pro-
prietary what were the hours worked by the
various reporters, gave in each instance the reply :
“ To come to duty at 10 a.m. and work until 3
a.m., if required.” That was somewhat more
picturesque than exact, but it gave a fair indica-
tion of the length of a day’s work on a morning
newspaper. A reporter is liable at any time to
be kept at work from 10 a.m. to 3 a.m., and even
later during the Parliamentary session ; and his
average hours on duty are 80 a week. This then
is the recompense for skill, education, exercise of
judgment, clean linen, general presentableness,
absolute honesty and fairness —90 shillings for 80
hours’ work !—one shilling, one penny, one half-
penny per hour!
How is it done ? Well, as a matter of fact, it is
not done. The senior reporter of a daily news-
paper should be a good, clear writer; with a wide
general knowledge to enable him to appreciate
the important points of a medical meeting to dis-
cuss consumption, of a bankers’ assembly to talk
finance, of a church gathering to talk scandal, of
a Judge’s summing-up and its legal points ; with
a sure, clear judgment to know what to leave out
and what to put in; with a sense of personal
responsibility, of honour, and of dignity to
carry him through temptations of drink, of
bribery, of social influence. In addition, he
should be well read in current events and
current literature, and know enough to ignore
the Latin quotation or the French sentence
of an affected speaker. But whereas a decade
ago he generally filled nearly all these conditions,
now he generally does n’t. Some of the old, a
few of the new school, still commanding fairly
decent wages, maintain the old tradition. But
most of the new race of smartish youths—
ill-paid, over-worked, with never enough leisure
to read if they had the inclination-fail to be
skilled journalists in several respects, and in Aus-
tralia the status of journalism as a profession
steadily deteriorates. The law of supply and
demand, sometimes slow in operation, is generally
safe and sure, and gradually the daily newspapers
are getting for the average Is. an hour, or less,
that they pay as a sweating wage, just about the
sort of man they deserve. Skilled journalists may
be noticed on all sides abandoning their profession
for the civil service, for trade, for anything ; and
their places are'taken by men of callow brains and
boyish judgment, who submit to be sweated on a
daily newspaper just as they would submit to be
sweated in a wool-store, because their measure of
ability gives no chance of relief. There are still,
of course, many excellent men on the various
papers, but their number is fast diminishing, and
will continue to diminish whilst present conditions
last.
In driving away their good men, the Sydney
daily papers are really draining away their own
life-blood. The result is seen in papers gradually
growing bigger and bigger—their sheets increasing
as the capacity of the staff to put the day’s news
in a bright, terse form decreases; in contents
daily growing flatter and flatter; in the Steadily
increasing crop of inaccuracies, banalities, stupid
blunders, glaring mistakes of policy. What
money is saved in staff salaries is more
than absorbed in increased paper-bills, in
libel-costs, and in other leakages. Yet the
foolish process of starving the brains of a
paper, and spending the savings on its feet, is
persisted in—company-managed organs leading
the way, those proprietaries where the chief men
have been themselves practical journalists follow-
ing reluctantly. The results are, for the moment,
injurious enough. When the time comes for
some enterprising man of money to start in each
of the capitals papers whose chief line of policy
will be to pick the eyes out of the existing press
—to get the smartest men available and pay
the highest wages possible, then the foolish-
ness of the cheap-jack policy will be fully
apparent.

The first edition of The Bulletin Reciter con-
sisted of 3125 co des; the first edition of The
Bullet in Story Book was 3875 copies. About 1000
copies of each hook were ordered by booksellers
before publication ; and at present the binders
cannot keep pace with the demand, r rom the
point of view of the trade’ these books are
uncommonly good value; and they look hke
achieving even greater popularity than On Our

is saying a great deal.
Ibsen’s dramas, formerly 2s. 6d. and 3s. 6d., are
reduced to Is. 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the new English
edition which Walter Scott is publishing. And
the new edition is thoroughly revised and freshly
printed. Probably it will remain Wilhapi Archer s
best title to fame that he was Ibsen’s English
apostle.

H.Gr.: As to the Australian Race. My ex-
perience teaches me that the child born in Australia is
either an Australian in every sense of the word, or else.an
aggravated type of Britisher. The biggest Jingo I ever
met was an Australian born of a Russian father and a
German mother. The most characteristic Australian
larrikin in Melbourne bears a French name and is the off-
spring of a Parisian (of the most stagey French type) and
a Norwegian woman. Of course, lam not speaking of the
German colonies in S.A. and Q., where the children rarely
see anybody but Germans.
“Jobber” : As to Lindsay’s way of drawing a
saddle on the ground, note that Mahony makes the same
blunder with the full-page illustration of “ Any Chance
of a Feed Boss?” in Bulletin Xmas number. Any man
who would destroy a saddle by throwing it down on its
flaps, instead of putting it on end, would soon be hunted
from a decent station.

audience.

BLADDER TROUBLES
BRIGHT’S DISEASE
For the full understanding of the curative action
of Warner’s Safe Cure, it is necessary to bear in
mind the processes of nature by which human life
is maintained. Reduced to their essential prin-
ciples, these processes are simply the wasting and
renewal of the tissues of the body.
It is absolutely necessary to life that the body
should waste away, and that its substance should
be renewed by food, water, and fresh air. Night
and day this process of waste and replaceman goes
on unceasingly. Every time a man draws breath
his body gains in weight by the oxygen, etc., taken
from the air, and every time he breathes out it
loses weight by the carbonic acid and moisture
given forth.
Insensibly, too, the body is losing weight all the
time. You can prove this by placing your hand
an a cold piece of polished glass, when you will
Bee that moisture given forth by the skin has con-
densed. Were the body to be entirely covered
with a coat of waterproof varnish, death would
quickly result.
Apart from the skin and lungs, the organs em-
ployed in this process of w iste are the kidneys and
liver , and the maintcn nice of those organs in
thorough working order is the grand secret of good
health.
The Kidneys. —The function which the kidneys
perform is to filter the blood and otherwise
separate from it the surplus water and the various
impurities which it contains. These impurities
are urea, uric acid, and mineral matter, which,
with water, constitute the urine.
When the kidneys have done their work, the
purified blood is delivered to the veins, and is
returned to the heart, having in its course
traversed the body and become laden with a fresh
supply of waste matter. The heart again delivers
the blood to the kidneys, which once more filter
it and extract the impurities. This process is
continuous.
The Livek. —The part the liver plays in the
process of waste is chiefly the manufacturing from
the blood the liquid called “Bile,” which is
delivered by the liver into the intestines, and acts
as a natural cathartic.
The liver and kidneys are very sensitive organs.
Sudden chills, fever, alcoholic intemperance, and
tropical heat are all liable to congest the liver and
reduce it to an abnormal condition. The kidneys
are exceedingly susceptible to inflammation. An
ordinary feverish cold, which closes the pores and
hinders the skin in performing its share in the
removal of the waste products of the body, throws
a burden of extra work upon the kidneys which
they may be unable to perform. Influenza, or
any kind of fever, taxes the kidneys unduly, and
may cause them to break down under the strain.
Any inflammation of the kidneys is very apt to
affect the liver, and vice versa.
Should the liver or kidneys, or both, become
unable to fulfil their purpose thoroughly, then the
blood becomes laden with urinary and biliary
poisons, which are carried to every part of the
body.
Sometimes these poisons become deposited in
the joints or tissues, and cause Rheumatism,
Lumbago, Sciatica, or Gout. In other cases the
blood, being contaminated, is in an unfit condition
to absorb nutriment, which causes Anaemia,
Neuralgia, digestive troubles, and Debility. In
other cases the supply of bile to the intestines
being inadequate, Constipation, with its attendant
evils result; in others, Biliousness. In others
again the impurity of the blood develops boils and
skin eruptions. Sometimes the uric acid is
deposited in the kidneys and produces Stone,
Gravel, and urinary and bladder troubles.
The reason, then, that Warner’s Safe Cure cures
so many apparently diverse disorders is that they
all proceed from one cause, namely—the inability
of the kidneys or liver to do their work properly,
and so rid the blood of these poisons in the
manner provided by nature.
Warner’s Safe Cure has complete mastery over
functional and chronic liver and kidney derange-
ments. and by restoring those vital organs to
health and activity, does away with the cause of
these several complaints. When the kidneys and
liver are efficiently carrying out the wonderful
scheme of work allotted to them by nature, none
of the disorders here enumerated can exist.

relating to Warner’s Safe Cure and the diseases it
cures will be sent post free to any address on
application to H. 11. Warner and Co., Limited,

Epilogue.
We fear not death. We have no tears
For perished hopes. We dread the cold,
On-coming, uneventful years
When even Love himself grows old.
Gnarled Age is near, a grisly sphinx
With stony, ruthless eyes of hate.
(What was her name, that little minx
Who wrecked my life, in Eighty-eight ?)
We care no whit for garish Fame,
The crowd’s applause can’t trouble us ;
The “fit and few” are much the same,
Their praise and censure frivolous.
We’ve lost our heritage of Youth :
That knowledge stings. . (Her eyes were blue:
That other one, the gentle Ruth,
Who broke my heart, in Ninety-two.)
We’re old and hipped and out-of date,
Our wind is scant, our hair is thin ;
And Prudence guards at every gate
Domains we used to wander in.
We’re cheerful as unfeathered crows
In wormless deserts dead-alive . . .
(Now, was it Dorothy, or Rose,
That killed my faith, in Ninety-five ?)
Within the garden of my heart
The trees are leafless all and dead,
And Memory, sitting pale apart,
Weeps for old joys forever fled. . . .
There is a girl across the way,
A lass with eyes that plead and sue,
Who .. . hang it! I will call to-day :
My pulse leaps still. Here’s luck, Nought-two!
T.
FRANK MORTON.
Myra’s Eyes.
He turned his mind from paintings rare
And carven things with strange old looks,
And came from out the musty lair
And witching dust of ancient books
To look on love in noon-time light,
And brown-gold tints of fading day,
And soft and saintly shades of night
That limned her tenderly in grey.
In which of these she was most fair
He could not say; but, did he call
Another lady to compare,
Then Myra was most fair in all.
Her heavy hair was black, her breast
As white as moonlit lily glows.
The pale exotic’s grace, the zest,
The smouldering ardour of the rose
Were blent in her. Her eyes’ deep goal
Such vague enchantments held that he
Was mazed in them. They stirred his soul
Like some old Eastern mystery.
Their purple shadow harboured sleep,
He peered in them as one who braves
The dizzy dangers of the steep,
Or darksome pools in ocean caves ;
And ever strove, by night and day,
With fond devotion to surprise
The wonders that in secret lay
Behind the dusk of Myra’s eyes.
He read within them wisdom, all
The magic of the East, and she
Could never speak a word too small
To kernel some philosophy.
They wed ; and he for one year round
Explored his dream-built wonderland,
Then said, in awe, that he had found
The thing he could not understand.
But came a hopeless day when he
Looked on those orbs in bitter stress,
And in their misty deeps did see
A drear and sterile emptiness.
And then he laughed : “Most learned and wise !
Hast with a soulless creature toyed,
And through the windows of her eyes
Looked three long years into the void ! ”
Y.
EDWARD DYSON.
Faith, Love, and Death.
Grey dawn, and lucent star, that slowly paled
Beyond the utmost flight of fervent prayers,
When boyhood’s heart looked up to heaven
through tears
Of joy, to see the glory of God unveiled :
High noon, and bridal earth, whose footsteps
failed
For very love —when passionate hopes and fears
Dazzled the flowers, made music in the ears,
And through the tranced wood their splendor
trailed:
Calm eventide—afar the lonely West
Dreams of the wondrous day, and dreaming, lies
With silent lips, and softly-closed eyes,
Lapped in the shadow of eternal rest:
Childhood, and youth, and age, for each a prize ;
Faith, love, and death—l know not which is best.

“Alex. M.” writes :
While not entirely sharing the elocutionary enthusiasm
of “ J E ” (B. 30/11/’01), I think that your foot-note some-
what misapprehends him. Elocution, in its proper sense,
has nothing- to do with eloquence. It is concerned merely
with the production of vocal sounds as sounds,
and without any regard to collocation of words.
Therefore, though I heartily agree with you that
we have already in Australia vastly too much
“illoquence” and public palaver generally, I see
no reason for supposing—good enunciation, articulation,
and vowel-tone being admittedly desirable for speech in
its ordinary applications—that scholastic attention to
these matters would involve any considerable addition to
the ranks of Blatherskite. Indeed, my own experience
is that English and Spanish, at least, are most accurately
pronounced by men of unobtrusively comprehensive
intellect and analytical cast, whereas the man who runs
to “ oratory ” is mostly a synthesist, and a bad one at
that—even'when his flourishes do not represent (as in
sundry notable local instances) mere gorgeously-arranged
intellectual indigence.
After which The B. begs to remark again that it
does not care a rap what enunciation, articulation
or vowel-tone a man uses to say “ Pass the salt ”
—so long as he can shut up gracefully : and it
has never heard of a man learning to shut up by
lessons in elocution.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion 1 If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, yon
never can recover, but go on suffering till deatli releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there be wounds j the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, 01
advised to submit to amputation j but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps j but I WILL. Decause
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

More Troops for South Africa.
A CABLEGRAM published on Thursday of last
week reports a new phase of the Ketchener
campaign in South Africa. Hitherto we
have heard much of the burning of houses
and crops, and the wholesale destruction of
private property—of the demolition of the
belongings of non-combatants, the reduc-
tion of widows and orphans to penury because
the British soldiers laid in ashes those of
their belongings which they couldn’t carry
away, and the other features of a campaign
compared to which that of Mehemet and
his son, Ibrahim the Damned, in Greece,
doesn’t look quite so bad as it used to do.
But still it was alleged that there was a
redeeming feature in the case. When the
Boer woman had been reduced, in an hour
or so, from, comfort to beggary, and her
household treasures had been looted and her
cherished possessions burnt, there was still
the concentration camp—the awful invention
of Weyler, the Spanish butcher of Cuba —as a
place of alleged refuge for her and her
daughters. There the food was bad and
scanty, the shelter insufficient, the surround-
ings foul and unwholesome, and the death-
rate worse than in the worst days of the
Plague—but still there was a semblance of
shelter. Thu cablegram (the Jingo papers’
cablegram) of last Thursday states that even
this is now being denied. It sets forth that
the army of humane and chivalrous Britain
now pursues the cheaper policy of burning
the houses, outhouses, and crops, the furni-
ture, clothing, bedding, and all other
supplies that can’t be carried away, and
leaving the women and children to perish in
the blackened wilderness. The nights are
bitterly cold even at this season on that
tableland, from 3000 to 6000 feet above sea-
level : it was in this region that the well-
fed Australian soldier almost mutinied at
being only allowed two blankets. It is the
wet season ; there is no fuel ; the very
occasional passing of a Boer com-
mando, which itself can find no food in
that desolated land, is the only chance of
assistance. It is a horrible story, and
Europe has heard nothing much worse of
any European race since Tilly captured
Magdeburg, in the days of very long ago.
Even Paskievich, whom no one suspected
of mercy or charity, treated non-combatants
more kindly in Poland—though he probably
didn’t intend doing so.
* * * •
This is the sort of literature that comes
now from the seat of war—literature that
reads curiously when we remember that it is
written by a British soldier (from Australia)
about the new British war-methods, and is
published with tacit approval by the papers
of an English-speaking community. No
word of reprobation accompanies it—not
even a line to .state that a grieved editor
trusts it may not be true, or that, at worst,
it is only an isolated instance :
Ah ! here’s open country at last. Johnny Bohr won’t
follow us here, for we are superior to him in point of
numbers, so we halt for half-an-hour, and burn a stray
farmhouse as some slight relief to our feelings. It is now
raining steadily—a rain that is like melted snow—and the
unfortunate women and children, whom we found in the
farmhouse, are left behind in the wet, without blankets
or shelter of any kind. Forward once again into the rain
and darkness ; it’s much too cold for us to ride, so we
sling our rifles to our saddles and trudge forward on foot.
It was so wet and so bitterly cold that even
sturdy, well-clothed men, with food and a
prospect of shelter ahead of them, could not
sit in their saddles without freezing. And
the British soldiery deliberately threw
children out into that fearful night to perish
in the rain, without provisions or blankets
or any place of refuge. And this, according
to the cable intelligence, is not an isolated
instance, but the regular mode of “ warfare ”
now adopted by Butcher Ketchener s bat-
talions—with no serious protest from the
bulk of the British nation !
* * * •
And the reply of the callous Jingo is that
these things are necessary to make the Boers
knock under, and if they absolutely sub-
mitted such things wouldn’t happen. Which
is true to the letter ? It always is true in
such cases. And Alva wouldn’t have made
his name an execration to all time in the
Netherlands if the Dutch had submitted—
it was religious freedom instead of
political freedom that was at issue there,
but the position was exactly the same. And
Mehemet and his son Ibrahim wouldn’t
have set all Greece on fire if the Greeks
had been properly submissive all along.
And Paskievich wouldn’t have desolated
Poland if the Poles had been obe-
dient to their conquerors. And the
Inquisition wouldn't have burnt anybody
if everybody had knocked under ; and the
Austrian rule in Italy would probably have
been gentle enough, and Weyler wouldn’t
have gone butchering in Cuba, and Cortez
wouldn’t have tortured the Aztec emperor
on his bed of live coals, and Mary of
England wouldn’t have fried anybody at the
stake—if the parties concerned had sub-
mitted. Even Tilly, whose dwarf figure
and huge drooping green feather have cast a
baleful shadow across 300 years of history,
only sacked Magdeburg because the Magde-
burgers wouldn’t give way and concede the
point at issue ; and Cromwell’s appalling
massacres of men, women and children in
Ireland rested on the same good and reliable
foundation; and there was an equally
honorable and Christian excuse for the holo-
caust of St. Bartholomew’s Day. Even
the brigand wouldn’t kill his prisoner if that
unreasoning person would hand over what is
required. In the case of the brigand’s
prisoner it is the ransom ; in the Boer’s case
it is the country—the Rand, with all its
stupendously magnificent probabilities. “ I
predict,” wrote one of the world’s greatest
mining experts, six years ago, “that by
1910 the Rand will be turning out over
£50,000,000 of gold annually.”
* * • *
The beginning of the South African war is
now a matter of ancient history. Even if
the Boers commenced the war without im-
mediate justification—a matter which is
open to much dispute—they had the excuse
that Britain had (apart, from the officially-
winked-at Jamieson raid) twice made war
on them, and had taken from them Natal
and the Cape Colony. At the worst, the
Boers were seeking to recover what had till
quite recently been their own—just as
Garibaldi and Cavour did when they
strove to recover Lombardy and Venice
from the Austrians, and as the Greeks
did, and the Poles, and many other
people spoken kindly of in history.
The penalty of unsuccessful war, no matter
what may be the merits of the case, is gener-
ally the payment of an indemnity and the
cession of part of the vanquished State’s
territory. If the Germans had resolved to
annex all France in 1871, or all Austria in
1866, they would also have had to deluge
the land with blood for years before they
crushed out the last embers of resistance,
and they would probably have degener-
ated into utter savagery in the course of
the struggle. So would Britain if it had
attempted to seize all France, or Spain,
when it ended its last successful campaign
against those countries. The demand for
the surrender of everything, as the price of
something so very ordinary as an unsuccess-
ful campaign, must drive a brave people to
the last extremity of resistance. It is a
demand which no white man’s State has
made upon any other white man’s State
since the execrated partition of Poland and the
atrocious doings ofNAPOLEONI. a demand as
outrageously beyond precedent according to
the ideas of the times, as was Alva’s demand
that the Netherlanders should give up their
faith according to the mode of thinking in
his day.
• * * *
And even if it is for the world’s benefit,
which is more than doubtful, that the Boer
States should be annexed, is not Britain an
alleged Christian country—a follower of the
Man of Peace —a bitter and inveterate spreader
of that Gospel which forbids the world to do
evil that good may come ? Truly, it is time
for England to burn the Bible publicly by the
hands of the common hangman, and go back
to the worship of Thor and Odin, so that
its faith may square with its foreign policy,
and its creed and its Ketchener’s gallows
won’t look so hopelessly incongruous. It is
time for it to sell its churches for drinking
saloons, and its bishops as a job lot in a
declmingmarket, and to take any price that is
offering for the national drama in which the
British hero declares that whoever lays his
hand on a woman, except in kindness, is un-
worthy to bear the English name. The
country which used to boast of its admira-
tion for a gallant enemy, and which sen-
tences men to confiscation of their fortunes
and life long banishment, and sometimes to
execution, for doing what Sir Richard
Grenville did, and the defenders of
Lucknow, and the Light Brigade,
and almost every other hero in its
Pantheon —keeping up their end of an ap-
parently hopeless fight—has no use for
bishops. The country which grovelled in
adoration before the Hungarian Kossuth
and the Italian Garibaldi for attempt-
ing to recover their native lands from a
foreign ruler, and hangs the Cape
Boer who does likewise, has no need for
churches. The nation which has got down to
making war on women and children, and
killing them by the slow torture of cold and
hunger and exposure, wants a different
creed and a ijew kind of national drama. In
these respects it acts very much as do other
nations in like conditions—only it strikes a
higher moral attitude than most of its
contemporaries, and sends out more mission-
aries than a dozen ordinary States, and it is
a cold day when Britain has to plead in its
defence that it is no worse than the
Spaniard, and the drill - sergeant-ridden
German, and the American in whose country
men are still burned alive by lynch law with
public opinion behind it. Nobody even
pretends that the women and children
and infants whom Ketchener’s brutish
policy is killing off wholesale are known to
have relatives carrying arms—supposing
th"t would be any excuse in the case of a
Christian people which professes that it
doesn’t war on women and babies. The
women who were believed to have male
relatives in the field were already provided
for by taking them prisoners and putting
them and their children on reduced rations
—as explained by the British Government in
the House of Commons. The campaign has
degenerated into a wholesale looting, burn-
ing and ejection—after the manner of the
Hun of over 1000 years ago, who left no
grass behind him.
* * * *
And Australia is invited by a crawlsome
Minister to send another 5000 men to help at
burning the Boer woman’s house—there
are practically none save women and
children left in these farm-houses now
—and casting her out with her daughters
and her infant in arms to perish in the
bitter nights on the Transvaal tableland.
There is no longer even a semblance of the
silly pretence that “the Empire is in
danger ” —though the suggestion that it was
ever in danger from two isolated inland
communities whose population was less than
that of Sydney or Melbourne was the
grossest and most foolish insult ever directed
at the Empire. And Australia hasn’t even
the bad excuse that it is led astray by a
hunger after territory, for it won’t get the
annexed territories. It’s only possible ex-
planation will be that it likes the work of
burning houses and reducing helpless non-
combatants to misery or death —or else that
it contains a large number of people who are
willing to do any kind of hangman’s
undertaking for 4s. 6d. or ss. Bd.
a day, and a larger number who are
willing that they should do it. As for
those who are trying to engineer the under-
taking, they don’t propose to go and expose
their well-cared-for skins to the chance of a
Boer bullet, nor do they propose to pay —
the bill will merely make another addition
to the deficit, which is constantly being
handed down to posterity. They will
annex what glory they can gbt, and any title
that comes their way, and go to church
regularly, and still put their faith in a gospel
which says that we should not do evil that
good may come. And if there is a Here-
after—but, on second thoughts, it will be a
great deal better for many Australian poli-
ticians if there is no Hereafter. It may be
very long and very lonesome if there is
nothing ahead but countless ages of lying
still, and flat, and silent under the loam,
but even that should be better than meeting
the long array of the ghosts of little children
who died homeless in the cold and rain up on
the veldt, while the farm-burner rode away
to burn out more helpless mothers “ for the
Glory of the Empire.”
Australian Trades Dis-Unionism.
Dear Bulletin.— Your remark (19/10/’01), “Pro-
vided the unions don’t lose their heads,” etc..
touches the weak spot in Australian trade-union-
ism. As too many cooks are said to spoil the
broth, so too manv heads spoil Unionism. Take
N.S.W. First, there is the Sydney Trades Coun-
cil, then the Eight-Hour Union, then the A.W.U.
(which embraces the bushworkers of N.S.W.,
Vic., and S.A.), the Federated Seamen’s Union,
the Newcastle Colliers’ Federation, the Broken
Hill Miners and Trades Council, the South Coast
miners, the mountain miners, and each and every
one of the isolated, unaffiliated, or unfederated
unions in town or country. Each of these bodies,
with the exception of the A.W.U. and F.S.U., is a
purely local government, having no fixed connec-
tion with inter-State unions or federations or
council or what not.
• * * *
Victoria is in the same state. It has a Mel-
bourne Trades Council, its branches of the
A.W.U., and its Miners’ and other go-alone
Unions. Queensland has no Trades Council or
other Central Union body in the metropolis. All
the little one-horse Unions go alone, with the ex-
ception of two or three affiliated with the Aus-
tralian Labor Federation, which embraces the
Bushworkers, several Miners’ Unions and one or
two coastal combinations. The Seaman’s Union,
of course, exists, and the Engineers, which is a
world-wide, and not a purely Australian affair, as
also is the Amalgamated Carpenters.
* * * *
South Australia has a Trades Council, a branch
A.W.U., a branch Seamens’, Amalgamated Car-
penters’, Engineers’ and other Unions. Wes-
tralia has its Perth and Goldfields Trades
Councils, Miners, and Workers’ Unions, and all
the other more or less united or dis-united unions
and combined or disconnected combinations.
And this is Australian Unionism ! The whole
business, so far as the great motto, “Union is
Strength, ” is concerned, is a farce.
* * • *
Union seamen work alongside blackleg wharf-
laborers at Brisbane. Union colliers and lumpers
and trimmers load coal at Newcastle, to be un-
loaded by non-unionists at Albany, where the
local Union men are on strike. If Broken Hill or
Charters Towers mines require free labor to
combat a strike they can get it from Ballarat or
Moonta ; or vice versa. A miner can blackleg at
Newcastle and work Union at Wollongong ; and,
after scabbing at Wollongong, he can go Union at
Broken Hill. A.W.U. men, so the Queensland
men say, take Union tickets in N.S.W. and scab
in Queensland. The A.W.U. men of New South
Wales accuse the Queensland men of doing ditto.
• * • *
There- is talk at present of a Federation
of Wharf-Laborers, another of bakers, and o_
other trades, upon lines similar to the Sea'
men’s Federation. These isolated Trade Fede-
rations are certainly a step towards the right
thing ; but until all the miners, and bush-workers,
andothertradesthroughoutthe Commonwealth are
enrolled as individual Federations under a grand
Commonwealth Federated Trades-Unionism, as a
social or political power they will remain practically
ineffective. Every one of these little Unions has
a head, and a federation with a common industrial,
social, and political policy is the only way to pre-
vent their numberless heads clashing—getting
broken, and lost.
* * » *
There is nothing utopian about the idea ; nothing
more than there was in the National Federal idea.
Already, the Political Labor movement —which
stands apart from the Industrial movement, though
there is no reason why it should do so —has had
its Federal Congress, and drawn up and defined
its platform and attitude. The platform is prac-
tically to give Trades-Union principles the force
of statute law. But no Federal Trades-Union
backs that platform up. The wrangling—or at
least the tacit agreement among the various trade
bodies not to come to a common agreement,
even on the plainest question of wages, deprives
the Federal Political Labor movement of that
support.
* * * », 4
Some of the foolish Unions —who apparently
don’t want to see cheap labor, long hours, sweat-
ing, &c., abolished, and fair wages, &c., substituted
by statute law —eschew politics. More, many of
the rankest Freeraiders, Fairtectionists, Free-
tectionists, and other Conservatives _ flourish in
Trade-Union ranks. Some Unions, in fact, are
strictly old-fashioned and Conservative, and are
mere benefit societies. Other Unions and union-
ists (principally the Bush, Miners’, and Maritime
Unions) are Democratic to the backbone.

And so, what can be said of Australian Union
ism ? Such a thing doesn’t exist —and more’s the
pity ! —X.O.
[Machinery does exist, has existed for some
years, for a general Federation of Australian
Labor Unions ; but a constitution apparently all
right in theory didn’t work well in practice. As-
to the political side of the Labor movement, many
of the Unions were frightened out of that by the
efforts of some schemers to “jump” the claim
and make it an appendage of the Freetrade party.
Most of what “X. 0.” says can be summed up
thus: Trades Unionists, like other people, are
human, and are prevented by various jealousies
from always pulling together; but, when a big
occasion does arise, they generally act with splen-
did brotherhood. —Ed. B.]
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “Permanent and Reproductive”
Tomb.
Among the items described as “permanent and
reproductive works ” to be paid for out of loans in
New South Wales this year is one which reads
“ Memorial for soldiers who fell in the South
African war, £20,000.” This appears specially
under the “ permanent and reproductive ” head-
ing. It represents about the last possible depth
of degradation to which even a conscience-
less Ministry can descend, and Parliament
and the people share the degradation. The men
who charge a tombstone to posterity as a perma-
nent AND REPRODUCTIVE undertaking are
possessed of a brassy insolence that would do credit
to a book-hawker, and a want of any decent politi-
cal conscience which might shame a burglar in the
higher walks of his profession. And to what a
sordid depth has descended the Jingo enthusiasm
of a year or two ago ! It is only about that length
of time since most of Australia was waving an
intoxicated brolly and holding forth at the top of
a thick voice about the “sacrifices” it was pre-
pared to make for the Empire, and New South
Wales was shouting with the best of them. What
unutterable scorn did these wild and bounding
merchants and importers and shareholders pour
on the head of the person who wasn’t prepared,
like them, to make unlimited “ sacrifices ” for the
empire, and how anxious they were to shed their
last drop of blood in the cause, and to guarantee
that the cohentingenter, when he came back from
serving the empire, would find his billet waiting
for him, and all the rest ? And then what a fall


ensued! Queensland paid the wages of its
contingent by the simple process of adding
them to the deficit, and borrowing money to
pay the deficit, and leaving posterity to pay
the borrowed money ! Victoria got over the
difficulty by cutting down its Old Age Pensions
and temporarily suspending the Act which pro-
vides for the repayment of the old deficit—thereby
leaving posterity to make up the difference as
usual. New South Wales added a lot of its war
expenditure to the old deficit, and covered the
rest by suspending a large portion of the pay-
ments in reduction of the said deficit, so, both
ways, it left posterity to pay the bill. And now
it is proposed that posterity should pay even for
the big slab of stone with which certain loyal
political bounders intend to celebrate the war
they didn’t go to and didn’t pay for. Isn’t there
a shred of honor, or conscience, or decency, or
honesty, or even the vestige of a sense of
humor, in the dull-witted N.S.W. Ministry,
which thus proposes to nobly sacrifice its
lOTT in the cause of Imperialism, and to stick
up its permanent and reproductive tombstone
for all the world to laugh at, with the pawn-
ticket adhering conspicuously to the side of it?
The Bulletin reckons that it is the best loyalist
and the best Imperialist and the best Jingo in
Australia, after all. It loathes the whole war
business, but, since there has been a war, it is
willing to see extra taxation put on, and to pay its
share of that extra taxation, in order to liquidate
the bill at once, so that this generation may settle
up for its own folly. It is willing even to pay its
share of the ridiculous monument if the rest of
N.S.W. will do likewise, seeing that it appears to
be decided that the silly object must be erected—
to keep alive a subject that a wiser community
would gladly forget. And it can’t find one Jingo
of them all who is willing to part with a copper
for either of these purposes.

Lunatics, Criminals—and Others.
Two inquiries held, the other day, in Victoria dis-
close the utter incompetence of the administration
of important departments by the Government of
the day. The first related to the allegation of ill-
treatment of a patient in the Metropolitan Lunatic
Asylum at Kew. Premier Peacock appointed
the three visiting medicos a Board to investigate.
The charge was not sustained, but, having decided
that point, this unusual Board went much further
than was intended, and got considerable inform-
ation for its trouble. Nearly all the witnesses—
from Inspector-General downwards—agreed as to
the shameful state of affairs at the asylum.
Built originally to accommodate 500 patients, it
now holds 865. For these and the *l3O atten-
dants there are a medical superintendent and
two assistant medicos, one a temporary officer.
No head nurse ha,d been appointed for 18
months, and the acting nurse is not certificated.
There were no trained nurses in the hospital
wards for 15 months at a stretch. Nobody had
ever seen any air or water cushions used, and
there are no baths on wheels nor any plunge-
baths in the hospital. There are no means of
warming or cooling a room. There are two airing
yards not in use at all, while the one used
is overcrowded, the reason for this piece of
foolishness being allegedly, the parsimony of
the Government in not making certain necessary
alterations. In one ward the board found 23
patients sleeping, six of whom had beds on the
floor because there was no room for bedsteads.
The single rooms were practically unventilated,
while many of the closets required immediate
repair. Out of the 46 nurses there was not one
with a recognised certificate. Last month there
were no less than 26 cases of bruises, &c., due, the
superintendent opined, to inexperienced nurses.
The while these inquiring persons were learning a
thing or two an inquest—on a patient who
had suicided at the Yarra Bend Asylum
across the river—brought out the information
that that “hospital for mental invalids 99 was also
overcrowded to such an extent that refractory
and newly-received patients were placed in a
ward together—apparently with a view to show-
ing the latter to what a state they might attain
with care and close attention. The receiving
warder here naively observed that he thought it
might be better if these two classes were placed in
separate wards, but at present it couldn’t be done
for want of room. This is the state of affairs at
the big metropolitan asylums—what it is like at
the out-of-the-way country institutions Heaven
only knows. (Sunbury asylum has no water
supply, save from tanks, so it can be
imagined how its patients fare for baths.)
All these matters have been reported on time and
again. The superintendent and the visiting doc-
tors have repeatedly asked for improvements ; the
Master-in-Lunacy urged a reorganisation of the
whole system on scientific lines. Judge Williams
investigated matters privately, and then wrote to
the papers charging the Government (and the
public) with callous neglect, if not wilful cruelty.
Even the common, honorary beak has urged the
establishment of a receiving- house. The depart-
mental pigeon-holes are packed with such docu-
ments, and now the fool Department is pained
and surprised at the fuss that is being made.
The only surprising thing about the matter is that
Victoria has any lunatics at all—that the un-
fortunate wretches don’t die off within a week of
their admission. The second investigation also
concerned the Chief Secretary’s department. A
number of prisoners at Geelong gaol have
attempted suicide lately—quite an unusual
number. One of these gentlemen is now doing a
term in irons —the reward of failure; another
succeeded the other day. He was the doctor’s
“assistant”—the department not providing a dis-
penser for this, the hospital-gaol of the State—
and he digested a mixture of belladonna, arsenic,
opium and strychnine—with the anticipated re-
sult. Another assaulted his own head with a
pannikin so strenuously that his gaolers for a
while had doubts whether they would be able to
keep him. -He is now in a straight-jacket, await-
ing the attentions of the visiting beaks. There
was no inquest held on the dispensing suicide, a
magisterial inquirer merely questioned the war-
ders and doctor, and entered a verdict that de-
cased departed through taking too many chemi-
cals at once. Then Inspector-General Evans came
down, looked round and returned, and casually
told an interested public that where there were so
many invalids in confinement there was bound to
be “a little grumbling,” and “there was nothing
out of the ordinary as far as the general system of
control is concerned.” The value of Evans’in-
spection and control may be gauged by the fact
that a sharp knife was found concealed on a
prisoner even while he (Evans) was at the
gaol, but he knew nothing of the matter
till he saw it in next morning’s papers.
Take it all round, the Victorian “ system ” seems
to have almost got back to the gruesome horror of
Norfolk'lsland in the early days. Minister Tren-
WfTH, when refusing a commission of inquiry to a
deputation, the other day, stated he wanted
definite charges and practical suggestions. As
regards the asylums, perhaps Trenwith doesn’t
consider a proposal for building decent up-to-date
structures and supplying them with a sufficient
staff a practical suggestion.

Protectionist Reid, and Protectionist
M'Millan, and Protectionist Pumpkin
Smith.
By this time, there is hardly one N.S.W. Free-
trader in the House of Reps, who hasn’t arot off
the mouldy lie that “industries in N.S.W. are
allowed to take their natural course, and are not
coddled or brought up on a feeding bottle.”
Everybody who knows anything of the subject is
quite well aware that a number of the largest and
most prosperous of cornstalk industries have been
protected for many years, that no N. S. W. Foreign-
trade Ministry could be found with enough faith
in its so-called opinions to abolish that Protection
and let “ the bracing air of commercial freedom”
in on these industries, and that N.S.W. didn’t
protect them for the sake of revenue, but sacrificed
revenue in order to protect them. The charge
against the Retd-M'Millan-Pumpkin Smith
push, which permitted such heavy Protection
to sugar, beer, tobacco, cigars, newspapers, and a
number of other things, is that it is telling a flat
and ungentlemanly falsehood when it says that it
believes Freetrade is the policy which makes the
country prosperous ; or else that while in office it
was a public enemy and a mean traitor de-
liberately trying to injure the country; or else
that it was a shifty and undecided coward without
the of its opinions, or without enough in-
telligence to know for certain what its opinions
were. By not putting the excise on tobacco and
beer up to the level of the customs duty it lost a
lot of revenue, and it lost a lot more by not placing
a countervailing excise on sugar, and by not
levying the same postage on local as on inter-State
newspapers—in fact, the amount of income it
sacrified so as to prevent the cold bracing blessings
of Freetrade blowing on these industries was
something alarming. The appointment of a Par-
liamentary Committee to find out, if possible,
why Reid and M'Millan and their doleful
Pumpkin Smith didn’t follow their own principles
when they had the chance, would furnish an inte-
resting billet for some undeserving person.

Maoriland’s Old liion.
Never, judging by appearances, should the
Seddon Government have been stronger than
last session. The organised Opposition had dis-
appeared ; the ablest Oppositionist had left the
province; the Ministerial majority was larger
than ever. Yet the session was almost
barren of useful results. Measure after measure
asked for by the people was brought in by the
Government, was lukewarmly discussed, and was
finally shelved or dropped. Thus the Referendum
Bill was rejected by the Upper House without
a single protest.from the once militant Seddon ;
the Fair Rentßillandthe State Fire Insurance Bill
were abandoned ; the Licensing Bill was brought
down so near the end of the session as to make its
introduction a mockery ; and the long-promised
County Bill, though printed, was not even intro-
duced. The only noticeable measure passed wasthe
Libel Bill, giving extensive powers to “jug”
pressmen. Every day of the session meant a loss
of prestige to the Government. The flabbiness of its
attitude on Federation was pitiable. The discus-
sion on the Pacific Islands question showed that
Seddon, with wild ideas of “Hempire” in his
head, had incurred liabilities and responsibilities
which he had never foreseen, and which neither
the House nor the province seemed anxious to
take over. The debates on the York and the
Ranfurly expenditure were a most damaging ex-
posure of the seamy side of the recent grovel.
Richard Seddon, in his declining years, has
apparently lost his initiative. He has done big
things, but the men who supplied him with many
of his great ideas are no longer here, and his stock
of inspiration has apparently run out. So, being
accustomed to do big things, he has tried latterly
to be a greater Jingo and Imperial groveller
than any one else, and has fallen back on
the threadbare device of floating big loans,
which have been a comparative failure, and,
after being one of the greatest successes in
Australasian politics it is quite possible that he
may yet end by being one of its most conspicuous
failures Yet in Maoriland, despite all its reforms
and all its progress, there is still a bigger work
left to do than any Seddon has done, and the
largest opportunity of his life is still before him.
The old lion has no need to spend his declining
years running after mice ; there is still an animal
of his own size to tackle. Maoriland has a debt of
some £50,000,000 —-about £63 per inhabitant. The
man who will find a way of dispensing with fur-
ther loans, and of gradually reducing the existing
debt, and who will set in motion a scheme for
converting the foreign debt into a local liability,
would have a large enough contract on hand to
make him the most famous statesman this
country has ever heard of. Seddon, in his
later years, pottering with small things in
which he has lost all serious interest, trying
vainly to think of a big war-cry with which to
rouse the popular enthusiasm as of old, flapping
desperately and uselessly at a big calico banner,
and scheming to annex islands full of useless
niggers, and to have a “foreign policy”—pretend-
ing to be still the same resourceful politician as of
old, with almost all his opponents dead and his
multitudinous friends lukewarm and bound to him
mostly by force of habit—it all suggests the old
humorist trying to behumorous again, orthe ancient
monarch of the forest mooning over the bones that
he accumulated in his fighting days. Seddon isn’t
so very old after all, but he is mouldering for the
want of a big idea, and a big opponent, and a big
fight—also a big advertisement. He would get all
four if he formulated a scheme for dispensing with
loans, and payjng off the loans that Maoriland has
already incurred. And there is nothing impos-
sible, or even improbable, about the idea. It
would certainly involve a big effort to get out of
an unwholesome old groove, but the Seddon
Government, in its better days, used rather to
like getting out of old grooves.
Trial by* Docker.
N.S. W. minor Judge Docker, at recent Quarter
Sessions, sentenced al3-years-old boy to six months’
gaol and a whipping for common assault on a girl.
I'he jury found the lad guilty of common assault
(with a strong recommendation to mercy), but
Judge Docker found him guilty of a more serious
offence, and proceeded to administer punishment
in accordance with his own verdict, not the jury’s.
It would have only been to a small degree more
improper if, after the jury had said absolutely
‘ not guilty,” the Judge had persisted in sending
the accused to gaol, for, as it was, he punished
him—and clearly stated that he punished him—
for an offence of which he was not found guilty.
According to the newspaper report—
His Honor could not understand how any iurv could
have returned the verdict they did on the evidence before
them. On the evidence of the girl it was clear that more
than a common assault had been committed. The law
provided that anyone who committed an assault on a
female might be whipped, and the present was a case
where, he considered, a thrashing would be the'most
salutary form of punishment. He then sentenced the
prisoner to six months’ imprisonment with hard labor,
and to receive 25 lashes. Were he to deal with the boy
as a first offender, the young men who sat in court might
think that they could commit sim' r offences and get off
free The whipping would be a lesson to them as well as
to the prisoner.
This proposal of Mr. Docker to make an accused
person whipping-boy for the benefit of other
young men in Court, has been, fortunately
promptly nipped in the bud by the N.S.W. Pre-
mier, who has countermanded the flogging order
pending inquiries. But something more is neces-
saiy than that strong rebuke to Judge Docker
over this particular case. His contempt of juries
has been so frequent and flagrant that it cannot be
longer ignored. This incident is but one of many.
Its particularly scandalous nature is, however
peculiarly well-fitted to give the prompting to
stern action. The jury found the accused guilty
of common assault, with a strong recommendation
to mercy, and a regret that “ the case should ever
have been brought into Court at all.” That was
their judgment on the facts, and they, and they
alone, had the right to judge the facts. Mr.
Docker brushed aside their verdict with con-
tempt, and substituted one of his own with what
he deemed appropriate punishment. The Govern-
ment, it seems, must choose now between trial by
jury and trial by Docker. One or other must be
abolished ; they are mutually incompatible.

Melbourne Marine Board has been complaining
of the dangerous way in which coal-ships are
/ArcTw \ to ,e oa^e< 3 at Sydney and Newcastle
(N.S.W.). The practice in question is mostly
limited to foreign-going vessels in the English
trade, proceeding by both Cape and Canal routes.
Owing to the high price of coal at Aden and Cape
Town, the object is to carry supplies to last in the
first instance until reaching Port Said. Fuel
is cheaper at Port Said than at Aden, for
ships discharging coal at the former port
pay no Canal dues. On the Cape route the
usual coaling ports are Las Palmas or Ten-
eriffe, in the Canaries—-about 38 days steam
from the last coaling-port in Australia (generally
Albany), and, as very few steamers have sufficient
bunker-capacity to last them for this period, it
becomes necessary to provide what are known as
“reserve bunkers.” These, if under hatches,
make a considerable inroad on cargo-space; there-
fore the decks are used for extra coal-storage,
sometimes up to 400 tons, and often in such a way
that, in a gale, water shipped forward has no
means of egress. The coal on deck thus, by
becoming sodden, much increases its weight and
endangers the vessel’s stability, besides being
liable to shift dangerously with every motion of the
vessel. The master is generally powerless in the
matter, owners’ orders being on no account to coal
at Capetown or Aden. So the poor skipper takes
his chance, praying only for fine weather until
there shall be room enough in his bunkers to let
him shift his deck-load. If deck-stowage is abso-
lutely necessary, the quantity should be limited
to, say, 100 or 150 tons, egress being provided for
storm-water shipped ; and the penalty for non-
compliance should be recoverable, not from the
master, but from the agent or owner responsible
for the deck-stowage.

“H.S.T.” discourses on the Boer butcher’s-bill:—
British War-Secretary Broderick’s recent statement
that “11,000 Boers have been killed, wounded, or have
left the country,” is so vague as to be meaningless. Then
he gives the number taken prisoners, and the statements,
taken together, are misleading. For instance, a Boer,
after recovering from his wounds, becomes a prisoner,
and thus figures in both categories. Also, the fact that
the actual number of slain is not separately given is sig-
nificant. The method of estimating the number killed in
this S’African business is a howling farce, anyhow. After
an engagement, sundry wandering Kaffirs find their way
into the British camps, and a nigger, who often cannot
count up to 10, is questioned, and his unsupported
say-so accepted as reliable. On one occasion par-
ticularly (when the present writer, through the
bolting of his horse, found himself nearer to
the enemy than any man in the British column)
the fighting was confined to one hill, and, after the Boers
scooted, this valiant warrior rushed the position alone
(he didn’t have his bayonet, which was in camp, serving
as a tent-peg), but he didn’t find any downed Dutchmen.
Yet, afterwards, in a dispatch to the War Office, it was
stated that, in this particular scrap, 32 Boers were killed.
I couldn’t make it out until Chamberlain (our dusky
waggon-driver) explained. Pointing to another nigger,
he said, “Duke of York over there. Him terrible liar.
•Him come in camp that time an’tell big boss plenty killed.
Get plenty scoff. Never see fight at all. He awful ter-
rible great liar.” That’s how the British “ Intelligence ”
Department gets much of its information. And you’re a
“ blanky pro-Boer” if you don’t believe it.

“0.P.” to The Bulletin about the opium-habit:
Hume Cook and the others who obtained the 10s.
increase of duty on opium have done a much larger thing
for Australia than some people might suppose. It is not
generally known that the opium-habit has got firm hold
in many parts of the Australian bush as well as in the
cities. Practically the whole of Queensland and portions
of N.S. Wales are affected, and it’s quite common in
those parts to meet travellers of all sorts mooning along
with their “ home-made ” lamps and pipes. The signs of
the curse are evident also in many of the townships—
especially the remote ones. Present writer, some years
ago, went into a Chinese den in Oharleville (Q.),' and
found 16 bunks built around one room, and two white
men on each—one smoking opium and the other “ toast-
ing” for him, turn about. They were a miscellaneous lot
—jockeys, bush-workers, clerks, drapers, and so on ;
some shattered skeletons with the sallow features and
leaden eye of the Chinaman, and others obviously in the
earlier stages of the habit—but all, without doubt, doomed.
On many sheep and cattle-stations, too, in both States
mentioned the drug is working silenttragedies. The mana-
ger or his wife often engages a Chinese cook, or persuades
Chinese dealers to camp at the back door, simply in order
to get opium on the quiet. A Chinaman cook once told
the present writer that the manager’s wife often came to
his room at night for a draw at the fascinating “ bubbler ”
—the Chinaman’s pipe ! Think, too, what the power to
withhold would make possible in such a case ! Think,
also, of the predicament into which the curse drives its
devotees, an inability to work and earn money, com-
bined with the necessity of finding the wherewithal to
procure opium. There are many cases, especially in
Queensland, in which white men do a little work for
Chinamen in exchange for opium, but, having no energy
left wherewith to earn a living, simply beg what they
can and crawl about in rags. There are worse phases of
the matter than these, but they can’t be mentioned here;
and as what I have set forth is mere casual discovery, the
trouble may be ten times greater than is suspected.

Thus the Westralian Worker :
The Bulletin asks: “ Would the miner who wants
cheap German and Chow and Jap. commodities growl if
the artisans asked for cheap minerals mined by Coolies,
or Japanese, or some other 4Jd. a day pick-wielder ?”
The miner doesn’t want cheap German, Chow, and Jap.
commodities. He simply says : If you protect one kind
of industry, why not another ? Why should you make
mining unprofitable in order to make jam-making profit-
able? Why should the miner out in the Never-Never
country be compelled to starve in order that a Melbourne
sweater may get bigger prices for his sweated goods ?
The miner doesn’t want black labor to grow his food or
make his clothes ; he has been the most persistent advo-
cate of white labor in Australia. But he objects to starve
in order that fat exploiters may feast. His motto is : A
white Australia, white wages, and fair play to all in-
dustries.
Verily the Freetrade-Labor paper is a weird
anomaly. The miner doesn’t want cheap Hindoo,
Chow and Jap. commodities. He wants ’em
made by white Australian workers working for
the same miserable wages as the Hindoo, Chow
and Jap. workers sweat. Which is a big dis-
aV 1( ir 10n the slightest difference. The
Melbourne sweater won’t be a sweater if the
working classes stand true to themselves. Give
the manufacturer his protection against the out-
side world, and regulate the wages he shall pay
and the hours his toilers shall work, and the
workers will have sufficient cash to spend to make
mining out in the Never-Never become profitable.
Will the Westralian Worker, or any other Free-
trade-Labor paper please state how we are to have
white wages, and fair play to all industries ”
unless we keep out cheap labor goods by a protec-
tive tariff. The day that is shown possible The
Bulletin will recant absolutely.
When the proposal was made, in N.S.W. Parlt.
more than two years ago, to send a colientingent to
neJp'Jimgland to crush the Boers, Prime Minister
Barton made use of the argument, to squelch
opposition, that it was too late to discuss the
rights or wrongs of the struggle: hostilities had
J ' ; 'o u 'h a j was the duty of all good citizens to
stand by the mother country, whatever
m’ght be individual opinion as to the merits of the
war. -tms argument, or appeal, was successful.
ISow, as the tide of Jingoism begins to turn in
ltmgland, the Chamberlain party appeals to
• U *mT l - n ser| ti mei 't regarding the war as its
justification ! At a recent meeting of merchants
and other wealthy people in Liverpool, a strong-
hold of Conservatism and rampant Imperialism,
the president, in his address, stated that if it were
not for the sympathy and support of the colonies,
they might almost begin to believe the war was an
unjust one.” Lord Salisbury has since said prac-
tically the same thing. In fact all British Jingoism
is now replying to the anti-war party by references
to the enthusiastic colonial approval of the war.
1 lius it now happens that Australians, who were
urged to stand by the dear old mother coun-
try in the war, whether right or wrong, merely
because it had begun, are now asked to carry the
burden of being the makers of the war, as being
the people whose profound conviction of the jus-
tice pf the S’African raid is ample justification of
the British Government’s policy, and full reason
why the enterprise should be persisted in to the
bitter end. This is our reward for accepting the
Bartonian appeal!
«.
The Barton Ministry has gone into recess with-
out taking the sense of Parliament on the timidly-
mooted proposal co send 5000 more men to
S Africa, and this should be a definite pledge
to, the electors that no action can be taken behind
the backs of their representatives. But can Mr.
Barton be trusted in this matter ? There is a
general conspiracy to bamboozle Australia, against
her better judgment, into sending away another
array (Sydney D.T. gives as one asinine reason
for this step that the German press has been
making nasty remarks). The Empire no longer
calls; it merely nudges ; but a nudge or a gentle
kick under the table is as good as a call to a title-
hunting politician, and a treachery to national
interests which timidity would have made im-
possible with Parliament sitting may be at-
tempted during recess. N.S. Wales feeling on
the matter is shown clearly by the stony silence
with which Premier See has received Mr. J. S.
Horsfall’s frenzied appeals to send out more
men to son-in-law Rupert Carrington. Mr.
Horsfall makes it clear that the British authori-
ties want to get the men, but don’t like to ask
openly (he avers that Ketchener himself dictated
or approved of son-in-law Rupert’s impas-
sioned cable). A private and confidential
communication, whilst Parliament is out of
session, to the Federal Ministry seems to be
the most likely thing in the world. Should the
Premier play the Jingo game, then it should
definitely kill the Barton tradition on this
continent. If the Commonwealth is to enter 01
its first war, let it be by the express sanction
of its Parliament after full consideration. That
sanction The Bulletin believes, would not be
granted, or, if granted, it would be after such
debate as would show Jingoism the trend of true
Australian opinion.

“ Pukaki ” writes in reply :
Re Kiwi’s diatribe (B. 30/11/’01) against the Seddon.
McKenzie land system. A big land settlement policy
can’t be run on the lines of “land-value” faddists of
various denominations. “Kiwi’s” admission that the
system has given satisfaction to all classes is surely the
best proof that Seddon and McKenzie, when they framed
the scheme, were acting not like theorisers,' but like
statesmen. “ You can’t fool all the people all the time.”
“Kiwi” complains that the big estates aren’t being
broken up fast enough At all events, they are paying
graduated tax, and, in many instances, absentee-tax, too.
“ Kiwi ” is out of it, by the way, when he declares that
selectors of resumed estates can acquire the freehold.
They can only take up the land on “ lease in perpetuity ”
(999 years). As to “ gambling ” in the leases, the Govt,
has just issued new regulations under the Land for
Settlements Act, by which preference is to be given to
family men and farmers ; and selectors are not to be al-
lowed to transfer for five years. Probably other means

The Foreign Importers’ party had a pretty bad
fall, in the House of Representatives, the other
night. It had been holding forth about the Clyde
(N.S.W.) engineering works as an'example of how
great local industries might spring up under Free-
trade. Whereupon Kingston sent for particulars,
and the manager replied stating that the original
concern (Hudson Brothers) had burst up
in 1896, almost immediately after the Reid
Freetrade tariff came in force ; that the factory
remained in a comatose state till 1898; that
then a new co. bought it solely because it
believed that Federation and a Protectionist
tariff were assured ; and that, pending the
advent of the Protectionist tariff, it had lived on
Government contracts (seven-eighths of its busi-
ness was Government contracts). Then there was
such a silence among the M‘Millan party that
one could have heard the footsteps of a butterfly
half-a-mile off, till a Freetrader got up to say in a
flurried voice that-the matter was really one of no
importance.

Winston Churchill on the war :
Week after week the end of the war has been ex-
pected, week has been added to week and month to
month till now we come upon the third year of waste
and sorrow, and the Ministers who ought to be cease-
lessly planning for the future, seem to drift helplessly as
in a dream. The people who asked the Government to
employ the iron hand and declare the Boers outlaws were
very short-sighted, for what could keep the Boer forces
obedient to their commanders better than the assurance
of perpetual banishment, or even of death, if they fell
into our hands? There is at the present time a most
perilous apathy. The war seems to be regarded as
chronic. Public attention is often diverted from it
Even such things as the racing of pleasure yachts turn
the minds of thousands from it. There is the' loss of life,
and there is also the wealth of the nation draining away
—enough to buy every month four of the largest battle-
ships in the world. There is India. Nearly 30,000 men,
detained beyond their contract with the State, im-
pitinntly await relief in India. Every day increases the
strain upon our military organisation and the embarrass-
ment of our finances. The loyal districts of South Africa
sicken in the grip of martial law ; there is the gulf of
hatred between Boer and Briton growing wider, and every
day devastation and ruin rules over wider areas.

Some years ago, a Polish gentleman, with
a name that sounds like a naked friend being
slapped with a wet towel, wrote a great novel,
and a woefully bad drama built thereupon was
staged at Her Majesty’s on Saturday. The stage
“Quo Vadis” is full of divergences from the
book, and they are all for the worse. An allegedly
comic bald general and his shrewish wife, neither
of whom is in the original story, take up a lot of
valuable space. The great banquet—that brilliant
function at which the palace of the Caesars was
full of the nobility of Rome, and the nobility was
full of liquor, and had slid on to the floor—is
represented by a table, round which about a dozen
persons are gathered. On it are many flowers, a
few cups, and what look like two pineapples.
And into this gorgeous scene, through the guarded
gates and into the guarded halls, there bursts
a sinister - looking brown Christian with a
thunderstorm in his pocket; and this person
straddles his legs far apart, and waves his uncut
mane at the best and most intoxicated Roman
society, and accuses Caesar with impunity of mur-
der, tyranny, incivility, unpunctuality, butchery,
impiety and aggravation. And then the usual
cheap and useless miracle happens—the wasted
miracle that is badly wanted later on when it
doesn’t come—for the lights go out, and lightning
plunges all over the promises like an illuminated
bookmaker trying to get away from his creditors.
* * m m
The play is full of curious and useless in-
novations. Eunice gets 50 lashes instead of 25,
which seems an unreasonable amount of flogging
for such a slender girl. Chilonides, the Greek in-
former, enters the story mainly that he may be
found listening to nothing in particular with
his hairy and neglected ear on Aulus’s doorstep.
Croton takes another large ruffian with him when
he goes to steal Lygia, and Ursus kills two of them
instead of one. The glittering Petronius doesn’t
suicide at a banquet among his friends, but waits
until Tigellinus and his soldiers come to arrest
him. Tigellinus has evidently brought six deaf
soldiers, for they stand gloomily against the wall
despite the most urgent orders to seize and drag
away their prisoner, and Petronius reads a good
deal of literature to them, and uses expressions
about Caesar calculated to cause a breach of the
peace. Then he and Eunice poison themselves at
leisure, and sit around at great length on the floor.
Nero’s persecution of the Christians comes before
the burning of Rome instead of after, which
stands the sense and intention of things on its
head, for the persecution is supposed to be based
on the allegation that the Christians had set a
light to the city of seven hills and fourteen
bad smells. And the dramatist sends Lygia back
to prison after Ursus has rescued her from the
stuffed cow with the starched tail; and Vinicius
is sent there also, and they escape by changing
clothes with Petronius and Eunice after the
fashion of the Irish drama. The two latter are
left in the prison, which takes fire, and then the
cold and imperturbable Petronius hollers for help,
and pounds on the door, like an ordinary person
with a thirst trying to get into an old Roman
hotel on Sunday, so that he may take 3d. out of
the tail of his toga and spend it on beer. Why
all these things are it is hard to say.
A good deal of fine old palace and much
picturesque clothing pervade “Quo Vadis.”
Petronius himself is so like Pete in the “ Manx-
man ” that he leaves behind no impression worth
defining. Ambrose Manning’s Nero is a fine study,
and among the male characters he stands out like
the big tree on One Tree Plain. His Nero is widely
different from Caleb Porter’s, yet it is equally
good. Basil Gill supplies a gloomy, but rather
forceful, Vinicius. Among the ladies, Miss
Lillah M'Carthy and Miss Edyth Latimer are an
early Christian and a late Pagan that are beautiful
to look upon and clever to boot. A number of
miscellaneous Christians, apostles, deacons, elders,
presbyters, martyrs and sundries call for no special
mention. Miss Belmore’s Poppoea only awakes a
sorrowful longing to see Nelly Mortyne back in
the part; and the brothers Majeroni, as Ursus
and Tigellinus, are at least respectable. The
Wilson Barrett season ends on Saturday —“ Ham-
let,” “Othello” and “Virginius” filling in the
last three nights.
*# * *
A. Jefferson’s drama, “ The World’s Ver-
dict,” has a short run at Sydney Lyceum till
“ Greed for Gold ” arrives to preach a moral lesson
of some sort on Boxing Night. The- “Verdict”
was staged some little while back, so it is only
necessary to mention that the villain is married
two deep, and that the usual irrelevant maniac
obligingly tries to dispose of one wife by means of
a home-made guillotine which he has fabricated in
some dark, damp place, evidently without police
interference. This is the juncture when the dress
circle’s lower jaw is supposed to drop on its tariff-
smitten starched collar, and when the gallery
man’s ditto gets a closer grip on his pepper-
mint in the tension of the moment. The
will, which, as usual, Stirling Whyte is killed
for making in act one, turns up secure in
act five, as might be expected.. Ethel Buckley
and Bert Bailey take the parts of two faithful
menials, Bert Bailey’s character suiting him
exactly. H. O. Willard is, as always, an attrac-
tive villain with a graceful habit of turning on hi
which argues deep study of the Family
If icrtALD ; while Miss Helen Fergus is a villainess
of excellent capability, with many changes of
wardrobe.

Sydney Royal is closed at present, but
inside Williamson’s double Xmas bill, “ The Man
who Stole the Castle” and “Alice in Wonder-
land,” isin strong preparation for 26th December.
At Williamson’s other theatre (Her Majesty’s)
there is to be a “sacred and classical concert ”
probably much more classical than the other
thing—by the Italian Opera co. on Xmas-night.
Then on the 26th the “ Commendatore ” and the
signors, signoras, and signorinas will let them-
selves go in “Faust.”

Charles Arnold opens Sydney Palace on
26th December with “ Hans the Boatman ” —the
first appearance of the big dog drama for nine
years, and also Hans’s first appearance at 35., 25.,
Is. Last week Arnold’s manager was advertising
for a lot of “ kiddies ” and a “ good natural baby ”
aged about 12 months to be the infant in the play.
No wooden, artificial, or unnatural baby need
apply. _ Prior to Arnold’s appearance a musical
entertainment, “The Arcadian Nights,” is to
occupy the Palace on three occasions only
(Saturday, Monday and Christmas night).
Miss Maud Celinski will play and Miss
Florence Mack will sing in these pro-
ceedings. Holloway and a melodrama, “For the
Sake of a Woman,” are due at Sydney Cri. on
Boxing Night. Also, the Queen’s Hall opens on
Saturday (21st) with “Our Army,”described as a
“grand military entertainment,” and “Little
Red Riding Hood.”
* * « *
Sydney Empire company still places itself
against a background of roses in the first part.
Hettie Warden creates some considerable interest
by her brisk “Rough and Tumble Boys”; while
Miss Amy Blackie’s fine voice is heard to advan-
tage in “ Kate O’Donohue.” But Amy does not
coiffure herself to advantage, and her f roc king is
out of date. Miss Ida Rosslyn is a practised actress
and makes the most of herself and her voice.
The cricket-match with which the first part con-
cludes shows that the Empire company has
studied the great subjects of the day, and on that
account may be commended. The second part is
brightened by the Elmore Sisters, the “some-
what otherwise comedian,” Fred. Rivenliall, and
Will Stevens, in a Female Impersonation of a
violent and nightmareish description. The Empire
is going to have a pantomime if it can be crowded
into the limited space. “Robinson Crusoe”
bursts on astonished Sydney on Boxing night,
as * * *
The only new face at Sydney Tivoli is the
elderly one of Mr. S. Holdsworth, an American
ballad-singer whose items are illustrated with
chromatic outrages in the shape of magic-lantern
slides. Mr. Holdsworth is a very-ordinary singer
indeed, and Mr. Rickards might have got as good
without going further than Manly ; but the turn
takes with the public. For the rest, the show is
very much the same as before, the first part still
being blessed by the humorous figure of the stout,
bald gentleman in gorgeous clothes solemnly fold-
ing to his breadbasket the arms of two young per-
sons, according, presumably, to the customs of
Venice.

The last week of the Italian Opera co. at
Her Majesty’s (Melb.) has added “Fedora,”
by Giordano, to its list of good deeds. Probably
this will be bracketed with “La Boheme,” in
general estimation, and anyway Melbourne will
remember it as a new experience that ought to
have happened earlier. The four acts of Sardou’s
tragedy are reduced to three in the operatic
version by the simple device of changing the
second-act scene from the house of Countess
Olga to the home of Fedora, where her
lover, after confessing that he killed Count
Vladimir, comes back by appointment to the
lady’s toils when the other guests have departed.
Some of the space between these two interviews
is filled in—what time Fedora sits writing a note
to the Russian police officer—with an orchestral
number not unlike the intermezzo in “ Cavalleria
Rusticana.” For the rest, the libretto is an
extraot of meat from Sardou’s story, and anyone
who knows “Fedora” in English can translate
the Italian opera at sight.
• * * 9
Giordano’s music is in “ La Boheme ”
style, but he hasn’t bound himself to a scheme of
fragmentary melody. There are airs that linger ;
songs with well-defined beginnings and endings to
them. The orchestration strikes one as having,
perhaps, a more durable charm than “ La
Boheme ” effects, and the question as to whether
any of these up-to-date operas will live to be old-
fashioned is not worth discussing. At present
they are a very pretty fashion. Signorina
Bassich is an artistic Princess Fedora, and,
as far as her medium-sized voice and meek
Mimi-like air will permit, is impressive.
But on Saturday the orchestra seemed to
put her into the shade at moments when
her voice should have been brilliant. Dani,
as Ipanoff, sang his best sometimes. Signorina
Vaccari was a gay and sprightly Olga, and Lom-
bardi, as the coachman in the first act, got a
chance to display his fine basso. To-night
(Thursday) the last performance of “Fedora” is
due, and on Friday the season ends with a mixed
bill. After which a number of people will begin
to think they missed something in not going
oftener to the opera when the chances offered.
* * *
“San Toy,” a musical comedy which is
expected to smash the “Florodora” record and
strike the new Governor pink when he beholds it,
is the Xmas attraction at Her Majesty’s. The
Xmas of J. C. Williamson is a movable feast,
and this year, same as last, he will put it ahead
of the almanac. “ San Toy ” is to get born
into this hemisphere on Saturday the 21st,
and Miss Florence Young will be there
at the time. The reappearance of Mks
Young, after three years’ residence in Pans and
other foreign parts, looks highly refreshing on
paper. Also, Mr. Claude Bantock, and Mr
Maurice Dudley will be introduced to Melbourne
as members of J. O. Williamson’s Comic Opera
co., whilst Mr. Spencer Barry is staging the
gorgeous production. After turning those e
names over in its mind, The Bulletin wouldn t
be surprised to learn that the limelight man is
Cholmondeley Vavasour, or something with de
Vaux in it.

The amazing (l War of Wealth will rage
at Me lb. Royal until Tuesday night, when bank-
manager Baker will take his chairman of directors
captive for the last time. Meanwhile, Bland Ilolt
is cracking his stockwhip to satisfactory business.
Bland’s character in the ‘‘ War of Wealth has a
fairly dishonest appearance at the outset, and his
Yankee-Australian language grows wearisome,
but he saves Baker’s bank with a waggon load of
money, and is seemingly the hero of the drama
after all. “The Span of Life” follows the
“ War ” on Boxing night.

At the Bijou, the variety turns around as
before, and the baggy pants and broken discourse
of the Musical Burglar continue to charm good
audiences.

Something new in the Opera House pro-
gramme is Gallando, who chucks lumps of soft
clay at a board and models faces with his fingers
at the rate of about 90sec. per face. The spry
Gallando has an undoubted talent for quick
modelling, and he only nee.ds a little help from
the imaginations of his audience to enable him to
produce a pale mud Kruger, or any other well-
known character within a given period. On
Saturday, he made George Reid the subject for
his last attempt, and George was one of his
failures, but when the artist has got a firm mental
grip of that misguided politician’s countenance,
be will probably push the clay pudding into some
likeness thereof. Leggy Pryde is singing new
songs and pattering other patters than at first,
and the Craggs are always fresh.

The Clown Ballet and numerous altera-
tions in the bill are maintaining Fitzgeralds’
Circus and the ravenous menagerie during the
“off” time that comes before Xmas. Some
educated dogs have been added to the Fitz
animal kingdom. Also the Dunbar who rejoices
in the name of Geraldine is holding on to a distant
bar by 10 toes, and dropping a hundred feet into a
net.

Adelaide Royal has been closed (for the
first time under lessee Pollock's management) all
this month, and the companies that stayed away
are to be congratulated on avoiding the heat-
wave. The Tivoli, without opposition, has put in
a strong time, regardless of weather, with Dante’s
widow, Will Whitburn, and De Wynne. The
latest turn is direct from London, Colby and
Way. The latter is a clever dancer, with a “La
I’oupee ” style ; Colby is a useful ventriloquist,
with some really new jokes.

The income shows the largest increase up to date, and
the amount added to the fund is also the largest. Fur-
ther, the expense rate, after showing a lamentable increase
for a number of years, has begun to move downwards a
little. The following are the expenses of the T. and G.’s
ordinary department since 1894 : —
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1894 .. £20 12 10 per cent. 1898 .. £29 12 4 per cent.
1895 .. 21 6 9 „ 1899 .. 34 12 11
1896.. 27 8 2 „ 1900.. 36 17 8 ,,
1897 .. 27 15 7 „ 1901 .. 32 3 7
The expense rate is still ridiculously high, and no other
office of any respectable pretensions shows such an outlay.
Still the expenditure of £32 3s. 7d. per cent, is an im-
provement in the case of the Temperance and General—
which only goes to further demonstrate what a lament-
able state it had got into in previous years.
The interest earnings for the year were £11,062,
equal to £4 10s 3d. per cent, on the average funds. This
is distinctly better than the figure for 1900 (£4 6s. Id.
per cent.), though it is not equal to previous years. It is
just about the ordinary rate earned nowadays, and the
T. and G. requires to earn something quite extraordinary
to compensate for its most disastrous expense rate.
The Temperance and General’s Industrial
Department also shows a large increase of business, but
otherwise its position is just about as bad as it was last
year:—

There are some weird possibilities about this kind of
business. In seven years the income of the T. and G.’s
Industrial Department has multiplied by four, with,
naturally, an increase of policy liabilities ; and the funds
have diminished by nearly £14,000. In the last eight
years the expense rate has been on the following ratio :
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1894 £32 13s. 9d. per cent. 1898 £93 13s. 2d. per cent.
1895 34 8s. 3d. „ 1899 84 19s. 2d. „
1896 47 5s. 3d. „ 1900 68 3s. 4d.
1897 112 16s. 2d. „ 1901 67 0s. 3d. „ .
These figures ought to be a warning to the foolish and
ignorant class which keeps industrial assurance offices
going. Even last year, when things were better than
thev had been since 1896, the person who paid £1 for
industrial assurance in the Temperance and General got
on the average 6s. 7d. worth of insurance for his money,
and the other 13s. sd. went in expenses. If a savings
bank invited the public to put its money m with the
promise that it would faithfully return 6s. 7d. in the £
with interest, what sort of chance would it have t Yet that
is what the industrial assurance business often amounts
to on the average when the expenses are paid. The 1.
and G.’s industrial department realises about £4 10s. 2d.
per cent, interest this year on its average funds, as com-
pared with about £4 ss. 7d. per cent, in 1900, so there is
an improvement here as well as in the expense rate, but
the whole T. and G. concern requires a lot of further
repair to make it an attractive institution.

It looks as if this was likely to be a bad year
with the N.S.W. railways and trams. Expenses are
growing faster than revenue, though revenue is in-
creasing handsomely, and for the first quarter (July-
August-September) net earnings were £36,395 less than
for the corresponding quarter last year. The drop was
from £333,980 in 1900 to £297,585 in 1901. Interest has
to come out of these net earnings, and the interest bill
has also largely increased during the year. Going back
over 16 years, from the 12 months ended June, 1886, to
the 12 months ended June, 1901, we get these curious re-
sults : In 1886 and 1887 Victoria had the most profitable
railway system in the Commonwealth : South Australia
had the best one in 1888, 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1894 ;
N.S.W. showed the best results in 1893 ; and the Westra-
lian system has been on top in the seven years, 1895 to
1901. But N.S.W. has held the second place with great-
persistence. It was first one year out of the 16, and
second no less than 13. Victoria held first place two
years, and second place two years. S.A. had first place
for six years, and second place one year. Westralia held
first place seven years consecutively but never second
place.

The Fourth Victoria Permanent Building
Society (Melbourne), one of the rare institutions which
met all liabilities right through the reconstruction days,
continues to improve, the earnings for year to 31st Octo-
ber, 1901, being the best for many years. Starting from
the period when the old reserves (£7821) and £28,114 of
capital were written off, affairs have gone thus :
**■ Written Re-
Profits. Dividends. off. serves.

1901 .. 6865 4 „ = 3864 8316
The profits represent £7 Is. 6d per cent, on capital, which
is a remarkably good rate in the building society business
nowadays. Deposits and advances on mortgages are
both increasing, and the Fourth Victoria appears to
have good prospects ahead of it if the management con-
tinues to be as careful as it is now. At present the
society’s own business premises are mortgaged for
£24,750, and it requires particularly to keep its dividends
low until it saves up sufficient to clear off this liability.
With about £30,000 reserve, and no lien on its building,
and no heavy interest bill to pay, the Fourth Victoria
would be in an enviable situation, and it should aim at
getting there will all speed.

Labor-member Law has long had a notice of
motion mouldering on the N.S.W. Assembly notice-
paper to the effect that Sydney gas-works should
be made a municipal property, in order to
“liberate our people from the painful necessity
of continuing to be supporters of a monopoly
which annually declares enormous dividends, and puts
thousands away to their reserve fundyearlj - .” About the
big dividends (15 per cent.) Mr. Law is right enough, but
seeing that the reserves are £26,000 less than they were
10 years ago, and no addition has been made to them for
a very long lime, the well-meaning M.L.A., in the latter
part of his discourse, is merely damaging an otherwise
good case by sheer ignorance.
The Planet Permanent Building Society (Mel-
bourne) for the year ended 3lst October, 1901, shows a
great improvement as regards ordinary earnings, though
the loss on realisation of its old securities is even worse
than before. The following is the record for the past
four years

The improvement in the earnings is remarkable, but the
properties in possession appear to be turning out badly
enough. The situation looks something like this :
Properties sold,

Presumably the assets can’t all be anything like as bad as
this, else the Planet couldn’t earn £2062 profit out of
them ; but the institution has had a pretty bad time so
far. The liabilities are being steadily reduced, and so is
the interest burden, the rate of progress being as follows :
Liabilities. Interest.
1898 £66,169 .. £2,814
1899 56,281 .. 2,368
1900 42,074 .. 1,856
1901 31,035 .. 1,148
With this material shifting of the white man’s burden
there ought to be a still larger improvement in the near
future. And out of the Planet’s £lOO,OOO capital only
half was actually put up by the shareholders, the other
£50,000 being capitalised profits, so even if it loses £50,000
in realising its dead securities the shareholders will only
be where they were.

N.S.W. Government has issued its programme
of public works to be paid for out of loans this year. Of
course, there will be a supplementary programme later
on, but this one runs to £2,597,913 to go on with. Of
this sum £1,789,839 represents works which may pay all
or part of the interest on their cost, or which can have the
benefit of the doubt, while the other £808,074 is made up
of works which won’t pay a single copper, and are not
expected to. These consist of little jobs and repairs that
will recur every year as long as N.S.W. stands where it is

and doesn’t relapse into plain savagery, and any com-
munity which was blessed with honesty or common
sense would charge them to revenue accordingly. There
are many interesting items among these alleged “ Per-
manent and Reproductive Works”: Wharves and
jetties to replace old ones (never paid for)
that have worn out, hospitals, consumptive
home, the lighting of harbor beacons, public baths,
monument to dead contingenters, court houses, police
courts, benevolent asylums, quarantine station, art
gallery, prisons, additions to Parliament House, the
dredging of rivers (which will need, to be dredged
regularly as long as commerce travels on them), purchase
of Government steamer (to replace old vessel, now worn
out, which was formerly bought with loan-money, on the
ground that it was permanent and reproductive 1), repairs
to old dredges (never paid for), and all the usual sundries.
N.S.W. already owes nearly £13,000,000 for unproductive
works that should have been charged to revenue, and the
figure promises to be well on towards £14,000,000 by next
June. Every year the Government describes gaols and the
like as “permanent and reproductive works”—and yet
the Speaker will fall like a landslide on any hon. member
who casts doubts on any other hon. member’s veracity.
The Victorian loan expenditure on “Perman-
ent and Reproductive Works ” for this financial year is
set down at £532,300. This is only one-fifth of the N.S.W.
expenditure, but the ghastly fact is that, barring one
possible item of £50,000, it is all unproductive, and
should all be fairly charged to revenue. Victoria has
been the least dishonest of the States in its loan dealings
up to now, but unless it hangs its Peacock it seems likely
to degenerate. “Maintenance of main roads, £15,000”
(maintena/nce, be it observed—just ordinary daily repairs
‘that the ordinary road-mender does with the ordinary
pick and shovel) is about the most amazing item that has
been seen in a loan schedule up to date. ,

The Adelaide Life Assurance and Guarantee
do. (which does no new business nowadays, and is simply
waiting for its last policy-holder to die or drop out)
doesn’t seem to be much of a speculation for its policy-
holders, but for the shareholders it is certainly good
■enough. These latter individuals apparently annex all
‘the interest earned by the policy-holders’ funds, and
.things go after this fashion :

'The funds are made up of shareholders’ capital, £10,000";
sreserves, £5097 ; and life assurance fund, £35,841. But
the co. is in this remarkable position, that the whole of
its life policies only amount to £28,200, so if all the policy-
holders dropped down dead this afternoon there would
-still be £7641 of the life assurance fund left for the share-
holders to divide. This and the other reserves would
■enable the management to hand back £2 ss. 6d. for every
£1 of capital, and after getting 15 per cent, dividends for
many years, this isn’t at all bad. Moreover, as there is
-even now nearly £7OO a year premium income the surplus
■is still increasing. This method of winding up is one of
■the curious possibilities of the proprietary life assurance
business. When a proprietary co. leaves off business it is
to its interest that the old policy-holders will take their
•surrender values and get out with all possible speed, so
that it can close up and divide the assets and save ex-
penses, and to induce them to stay in by any reckless
(liberality would be sheer foolishness.

Soon after the Canadian Independent Order of
Foresters started life assurance business in Australia,
(Premier Peacock, of Victoria, was invited to test its bona-
,'fides by having an audit made of its accounts (in Canada).
(Peacock declined the responsibility in these beautifully
■non-committal terms, which the institution is now adver-
tising all over Australia as a certificate of solvency :
“ The Government has evidence in its possession that
the business record of the Independent Order of Foresters
In Canada, where its head-office is situated, has been a
perfectly honorable one ; and that it is licensed to do the
(business of life assurance in many States of the United
States of America; and that, after examination and inspec-
tion, these licenses issued annually have been renewed ;
■and because the Government also has evidence that the
institution is incorporated by a special Act of the Parlia-
ment of Canada, that it is regularly licensed by the life
assurance department of the Government of Canada to do
(the business of life assurance in the Dominion, and that
iit is under Government inspection in Canada. The
‘Government also has evidence that it is licensed by the
(Board of Trade of Great Britain to do the business of life
Insurance there, and that its quinquennial valuation of
:assets was duly accepted by that body.”
Which might be put thus :
(1) The 1.0. F. has a perfectly honorable record in
•Canada, inasmuch as i t has paid all claims up to date. Every
•office that is alive has done that, whether solvent or in-
-aolvent; when an office can’t pay claims it dies. The
■fact doesn’t prove that the funds are equal to the lia-
'bilities.
• (2) Ist is licensed to do business in the United States like
any other assessment office. The U.S. is full of the
‘wrecks of dead assessment offices, but it still lioenses the
-survivors.
(3) It is incorporated by a special Act in Canada, which
.'Act compels it to declare itself as an assessment office—
t.e., one which reserves the right to make calls on its
! policy-holders over and above the premium which they
• originally agree to pay, or which reserves the right to
■charge increased premiums. Its special Act is not a cer-
tificate of its special solvency, but is rather in the nature
•'of a special precaution against its being mistaken for the
‘usual kind of life office.
(4) It is licensed in Great Britain, and its valuation of
“assets is accepted there. There is no law in Great Britain
‘under which the State can refuse to accept any assurance
■ office’s valuation. Even the valuation of the Yorkshire
(Provident is accepted, and it has been in business for 30
‘years, has a premium income of over £12,000, and large
inabilities under its policies, and has not only no assur-
ance fund at all, tout has lost most of its capital.

The once great Union Mortgage and Agency
f Oo. of Australasia, and its brother and off-shoot, the
'Australian Estates and Mortgage Co., continue to have
! hard luck. This joint concern was originally the Union
'Mortgage and Agency Co. pure and simple. Then when
I bad times came, the brilliant London management con-
‘eeived the idea of selling most of the properties to the
rnewly-formed Australian Estates and Mortgage Co. As
(the old co. held practically all the shares in the new co.,
‘ this left things just as they were except that there was
1 the cost of the extra management and extra bookkeeping
rto be considered. Later on, it was proposed to sell the
‘ remaining scraps of the old co. to the new co. in order to
save expense of management, which would just make
lit the same old co. under a new name, and now a
“great and cumbersome amalgamation scheme of this kind
is in progress. This is the recent record of this truly
remarkable double-barrelled institution, the two com-
panies being lumped together for convenience :

These two remarkable concerns have a nominal
joint capital of £2,258,660, but of this one co. holds the
other co.*s shares to the amount of £1,229,930, so the real
joint capital is £1,028,730. Nearly a quarter of this has
disappeared. _ Last year, the ordinary income of the
two companies (apart from profits made by repur-
chase of depreciated debentures) was £111,096, and as the
interest on the debenture-liabilities alone absorbed
£153,532, saying nothing of working expenses of
all kinds, the situation looks about as bad as it could be.
The one gleam of real humor in the business happened in
1896, when one co. made a small profit and the other a
considerable loss, the two combined making a net loss of
£999. Whereupon the first co. paid a dividend to the
second co., and pointed to the profit it had made before
paying the dividend, and the other pointed to the profit
it had made after receiving the dividend, so that they
both looked well, though the joint loss of £999 was there
all the time.

The Broken Hill outlook is still gloomier.
Lead has fallen further, going down to t'lo 10s. A weak
market just before Xmas is, however, the common thing ;
but, though there may be a temporary recovery after
the holidays, there is nothing to indicate that bottom has
been reached. In fact, the last published lead statistics
are unfavorable. Meantime, the B. H. miners are more or
less considering the co.’s request to them to accept lower
wages. The employees directly interested have handed
the matter over to the whole body of workmen. The argu-
ment is that if the men in the small mines give way, B.H.
Prop, and Sulphide men will soon be asked to accept too,
so that all are equally interested. But there is this big
difference—the big co.s’ men are not in' immediate peril
of losing their work by deciding against reduction,.while
the smaller co.s’ men are. If it comes to fighting, the
men have nothing to fight with, and they know it ; but
most of them take up this position—“ It’s a wholly inade-
quate wage you ask us to accept, and we will not consent
to accept it. If, however, you force it upon us—well,
that’s another matter.”

No worse report than that of Block 14 for the
half-year ending Sept.' 30th has been issued by any
Broken Hill mining co. Between March 31 and Sept. 30
the co. made a dead loss of £8279, and also reduced its
surplus of liquid assets from £19,041 to £9484, so that it
is over £17,000 worse off than it was at the end of March.
Moreover, nothing is written off for depreciation, so even
above figures don’t represent the real loss. During the
six months 1600 tons more of lst-grade carbonates were
treated than for the Oct.-March half-year, and 20,000 tons
less of 2nd-grade carbonates and sulphides. With only a
surplus of £9484, as shown, in hand, the financial position
of the co. cannot be regarded as satisfactory, and, if dras-
tic economy is not adopted, the mine had best, like some
others, close down till the lead-market improves. With a
view to meeting the situation, the directors have reduced
the salaries of the Broken Hill officers by 10 per cent.,
which means a saving of £3 ss. 10£d. per week.

Dapto Smelting Works : This co. has gone into
reconstruction in London by the issue of 150,000 7 per
cent, cumulative preference shares of £1 each; an
analysis of the financial condition shows that, when every-
thing is provided for, the co. will only have about £ll,OOO
to go on with. It happens to be indebted to Dalgety and
Co. to the extent of £105,000. A disastrous past is ad-
mitted, and, of course, a brilliant future assured. Now
declared that the economic position of the site is better
than any other smelting-works in Australia. That is not
correct. Writer has always said that it occupied a bad
site, and he has never had reason to alter his opinion.
Also, it is averred that there is an abundance of
suitable smelting ore obtainable for a large and profitable
business. Then why is it that the plant has never been
kept in full blast for any length of time ? The works are
valued at £300,009, and it is estimated that by treating
300 tons of ore per day the net earnings show a profit of
about £BO,OOO a year, but where is this ore to come from ?
The Bulletin can only sadly shake its head.

Mt. Boppy, N.S.W. : From London comes the
news that the clean-up for October is 9440z5. from 1900

available the mine should go on the div. list.

Copper continues to fall, and is likely to see
£5O a ton by the time this gets into print. Cabled that
shares in the Amalgamated Copper Co., alias the Ameri-
can “combine,” have fallen from £l3O to £65, that this
has had the extent of depreciating the holding of Thomas
Lawson to the effect of £2,000,000 !—that “ bears ” were
forcing him to sell, and, by this means, Rothschilds and
Rockfeller would be able to control the world’s copper-
market. This cable is somewhat indefinite. Why should
they go for Lawson ? Are they trying to ruin him as the
Vanderbilts many years back tried to ruin Jay
Gould (and would have succeeded but for American
banks coming to his rescue—not that the banks
wished to save Gould, but did it to prevent a panic).
Prices of shares in Australian copper-mines have not
depreciated in proportion to the fall in the metal. Writer
has a cable from London to say that prospects of
immediate improvement are unfavorable. Dr. Reid, a
director of the Cobar Copper Syndicate, fears that the
collapse of the French Copper Syndicate ten years ago will
be repeated ; if so, it will be a bad thing for Cobar. In the
big mine the gold-contents of the copper have been going
down. At one time the gold was 4oz. in a ton of copper,
and now it is only 2oz. Most of the big mines will continue
to work copper at £5O a ton, but only one or two of them
will be able to pay more than wages and working expenses
at that figure. Throughout Australia copper-mining
will be in the same position as the silver-lead mining
industry at Broken Hill. Already Blayney mine has
closed down, throwing 200 men out of work; just
at the time, too, when the mine is looking re-
markably well and might be made to pay with two
furnaces. It is hard luck on the Lloyd’s copper-
mine at Burraga, where they have been for over a
year preparing to more than double their output; and
the collapse occurs just as they are ready to start their
concentrating works. Lloyd’s is a rich, permanent, and
high-grade mine, but with expensive London and
local management, and copper at £5O per ton
divs. will be like angels’ visits. Mt. Lyell can’t
possibly pay with copper at £5O a ton, and with the
loss of its chief customer, North Mt. Lyell. Strange, too,
that these shares should keep so firm, unless they’have
some big developments in the mine’s lower level, of which
the public have heard little or nothing. What hope is
there for Chillagoe under existing circumstances ? Share
6d - ln London and Is. 9d. in Australia. Bad new
travels more slowly than good, and, no doubt, when the
m -n\ ar u VeS .i n London from Australia, shareholders there
horrified with the detailed account of things at
Chillagoe. Mt. Garnet is turning out a large quantity of
rich matte, but there can be no profit at the present
price of copper. The market will have the effect of
shutting up a number of small copper shows, especially in
u u*u n °k pay to work unless copper were
much higher in price. These could be enumerated, but
it is not worth while. If copper stays at or under £5O a
ton, thousands of copper miners will be thrown out of
work sooner or later.

Golden Link, W.A., has arranged for the treat-
mentinFeb. of a 1500-ton parcel at Hannan’s Star mill.
Ibis news probably means the ushering-in of the Golden
« m >. " f the regular monthly producers of the
neid. If it has taken this mine five years to obtain 1500
tons of ore, how is it possible to keep up a regular return,
tor it is well known that it is not the result of recent
mining operations but a laboriously-compiled accumula-
tion. Having what was at first regarded as a splen-
did position (between the Great Boulder and the
Lake View) the Golden Link started work with
an enormous working capital. It has never been
short of money, and must have spent to date up-
wards of £250,000. It has sunk a shaft 1100 ft., put
out crosscuts and levels in every direction, and, while it
has a little ore, there is nothing to warrant the price of
the shares or the things said about it. It certainly
deserves a better fate, and but for London money it
would have shut down long ago and waited till one of the
adjoining mines proved gold up to its boundary. With-
out ever having a crushing, much less a div., this mine
has a market value of nearly half-a-million, while the
bouth New Moon and Clarence mines of Bendigo, each of
which has years of ore in sight, and is paying nearly 100
per cent, on its capital, have only a little more than half
ot the Golden Link market valuation between them
Just think of it!!

Boulder No. 1: The battery on this mine is
being fitted with a plant to treat sulphide by the Riecken
process of gold-extraction worked successfully at the
South Kalgurli. There is no doubt that if the expensive
and enormous sulphide plants on the Great Boulder, Per-
severance, and other mines had not been erected this
process would be in common use at Kalgoorlie. It is
cheaper and more effective than filter-pressing and
ordinary cyaniding. The extraction is if anything
greater, and the bullion is got in a cleaner form. All
slimes are not suitable for filter-pressing, as other mines
outside of Kalgoorlie have found out to their cost, parti-
cularly at the Waihi, where the presses have had to be
thrown out.

The big mines of W.A. : Perseverance, 10,743
tons, 14,1470 z record yield. If the bottom levels in
this mine were as good as from the surface down to 400 ft.
the present price of the shares, £9 155., would be justified.
The bulk of the output comes from a run of gold near
the Lake View boundary. It is nearly 300 ft. long on the
surface, narrows to «oft. at the 500ft.'level, and seems to
have gone right out in the levels below. The second lode,
known as the Perseverance, looks like living to a greater
depth, and may save the mine from disaster when the
other is worked out, which it is likely to be, at present rate
of production, within the next 12 months, unless another
golden zone is found at greater depth. These big ore
lenses of the Lake View and Perseverance do not seem to
carry down unlike the ore in the Boulder and Ivanhoe,
where it runs more in the form of chutes.

Lake View Consols: 10,104 tons, 14,4120 z.
These shares went to £7, but have started to recede, and
are bound to get to £5 before they see £lO, which they will
probably never reach again. Wired to the eastern dailies
that the yearly report will show that the ore reserves
have largely increased and there is now £650,000 in sight.
Allowing for expenses that would not pay £2 a share
in divs. So much development work has been done
without opening up any new ore bodies that there is good
ground to fear nearly everything left in the mine has
been exposed, and something extraordinary will have to
happen to stave off another collapse in the gold yield and
in the share market.
• • • •
Golden Horseshoe : 8758 tons, 15,3270 z: This
mine is a sealed book, although it has leaked out that in
the bottom level the ore, although rich, has a tendency
to string out —indicating that the mine will not maintain
its richness to a great depth.
* * * *
Associated: 3538 tons, 32900 z. It is expected
that tonnage and yield will be doubled within the next
few months, but the mine must be worked more cheaply
than any other on the field to pay divs. from sulphide ore
worth under an oz. to the ton. Shares, 445.—£1,100,000
for such a mine ! Imagine such a valuation for any
Australian-owned mine that had been working at a loss
for two years!
* * * *
Kalgurli (1505 tons, 18690 z.) will have no return
this month, and probably none next. It will take that
time to make the new installation to deal with a bigger
tonnage. About time that this mine paid a div if it’s
ever going to do so. Shares, £3 12s. 6d. Nearly half-a-
million for a mine that has never returned the share-
holders a shilling, but that is a common inconsistency on
the London mining market, and for which there is no
accounting.
* * * *
South Kalgurli (1920 tons, 1900 oz.): Still no
div., and another evidence that there is no profit in loz
sulphide ore unless worked on a bigger scale than this
mine is able to do.
* * * *
Ivanhoe: 10,527 tons, 11,0870 z. An improve-
ment in yield from a largely increased tonnage, but not
so great as anticipated. It would be surprising if it were.
Lake View South : 2122 tons of tailings
cyanided for 5230z5. These tailings did not come out of
the mine, and therefore the gold morally belongs to other
people, butjthey have Buckley’s chance of getting it.
Boulder Main Reef : 1864 tons, 21020 z. Next
year will probably see this mine worked out.
* * m a
Brownhill: 52860z5. for about an equal tonnage
of sulphide ore and sands. It was expected that this
mine would have exhausted its ore-reserves months ago,
but development proved they were more extensive than
supposed even by the management. It will be remarkable
if the present monthly output is kept up beyond Feb. or
March next. This co. is said to be making another move
to amalgamate with another mine—this time with the
Oroya, in which it is said to have already acquired a
good number of shares. Last year it failed in an attempt
to buy the northern Oroya block. It has a hig plant, for
which it will soon have no use, and, as the Oroya is
believed to be a mine without a plant, some good might
come of amalgamation. Last quotation is £3 7s. 6d., and
a big drop is expected shortly. Oroya shares on bore-
hole developments went to 565., and are back to 45s
What’s up ?
• * • •
Great Fingall Consolidated : 3620 tons, 65360 z.
This, it is reckoned, will be increased to at least 10,000 oz.
per month as soon as the new plant gets going. It is
probably the biggest mine in W.A. Shares £l3 7s. 6d.,
and, no matter how great the slump in other directions
they maintain their price. It has no sulphide problem to
solve, but runs a free-milling quartz reef, averaging 15ft.
thick, and opened up in several levels 700 ft. in len»th
With 10,000 oz. a month, it can make as much profit as
any other Kalgoorlie mine with 15,0000 z., and, if next lift
opensup as well as those above, shares will see £2O.
* * • *
Great Boulder: Over 13,0000 z. for the month.
A substantial improvement, but a much greater has
taken place in the mine at 1200 ft. level. This mine has
more ore m sight than any other two on the field, and
will probably maintain its present price—-£l—when
several of the others have fallen 50 per cent. It has a
long life assured. As aloor 12 per cent, mining invest-
ment these shares are as safe as anything in Australia,
and safer than anything else on the field.

Hampden copper-mines, N.Q. Last consign-
ment sent to Wallaroo Smelting Works, 528 tons
Average copper-contents 36£ per cent.: yield, after del
ducting smelting charges, £10,624, or £2O 2s. per ton.
Stacked at the mine 4967 tons of second and third grade
ore, already classified and assayed, containing a present
poss value of £28,838. This mine is probably more
* * * *
Taiisman (M.L.): Clean-up for last month
averaged 275. 6d. a ton, Is. 6d. more than previous month.
This could not be got without sorting the ore, and it will
barely pay at that. And yet the mine has a market
valuation of upwards of half-a-million. Many other
M.L. mines floated in London some few years ago had an
equal, and in some cases, a greater valuation. Komata
reefs were once over £5; present buyers 6d., sellers
Is. 6d. Hauraki, 6d. sellers. They were once as many
pounds. Waihi Grand Junction stay at 30s. because of
proximity to the great Waihi, although it has spent a
lot of money without finding pay ore, and it has been
proved beyond a doubt that the Waihi has got all the
gold in its own ground—an area of 500 acres. New
Zealand Grown, 10s. This mine is a small div.-payer, and
there is a great inconsistency between it and the Talis-
man, the shares of which, based on the share capital, are
tour times a,s high, although it has never paid a div. and
nas got a mighty poor show of ever paying one. A few
months work, and the Talisman will go the way of nearly
all the others, the distinguishing and lasting exception
being the Waihi, which has the largest plant in Aus-
tralasia, and if it does not become the greatest producer
it has a life probably only equalled by Mt. Morgan.

King Conrad, N.S.W.: The concentrators may
or may not be in operation at the end of the year. A lot
ot ore a,waits treatment, and, as there are large supplies
of ore there should be a regular output of concentrates
when the plant really does make a start. Not likely to
pay at current price of its metals.

Government, at 30th June, 1901, had
oi 41 u 0 ' * rust funds in its charge, and of these
x&,U5J,382 has been borrowed by the Treasurer to make
ends meet. This is apart from those funds that are
permanently invested in State securities. If the trust
funds were planted out of the Treasurer’s reach, so that
he couldn’t borrow them at every emergency, the pay of
State officials would be about as erratic as the salary
of a Bashi-Bazouk.

Gibraltar mine, N.S.W., is on tribute now, 60
miners being employed. The co. is, however, extending
operations on the Williams line of reef, where it hopes to
get good stone from the recently-acquired Caledonian and
Woods properties.

Surely it can’t be true that N.S.W. Judge

Gavenlock, should receive 25 lashes from the cat-

lash used, the thing is incredible. If, however,
it happens to be true, then Mr. Ernest Brougham

In an interview on his Divorce Bill, pub-
lished in the Arous, Senator Dobson has much
unnecessary religious doodleflap, but he hits the
nail fair on the head when he characterises
the proposed excision of the three years’
desertion clauses as leaving a condition of
affairs which “weak human nature may not be
able to withstand.” This is a point for the
Church party to remember. If a deserted man
or woman desires to re-marry, and is not per-
mitted to do so, he or she will simply marry
without marriage. Even a big gun of the Church
knows that while a man remains strong and
healthy his religion is very small potatoes beside
his girl, and the same applies to the woman.

bubonic corpses he mouldering in Mouth Head
cemetery—has already been quite lost in some
parts of Sydney. Manly is not far off that ceme-
tery, yet the condition of the public conveniences
at more than one Manly hotel is so unspeakably
filthy as to be a burning disgrace to the lodal
authorities.
* » * *
The recurrence of the bubonic scare has
brought to light in Melbourne the pleasing infor-
mation that thousands of bags of sugar are con-
tinuously stored in the local wharf sheds; that
the rats sample these and spread the contents
abroad, and when the buyer of a hundred bags or
so removes his lot, he always carefully collects the
sweepings and fills up the broken bags.

Attorney-General Wise says he has a Bill
in hand “dealing with” the glaring blue and
green advertisements which disfigure Sydney har-
bor, and The Bulletin trusts that it deals with
them in a ferocious spirit. There is no adequate
remedy save utter annihilation. The growth of
unkempt Sydney is destroying the harbor beauties
surely enough, still its progress is comparatively
slow. But the great spider-legged advt. about
the defunct pill for dead people overruns the
beauty-spots in a night, and the globule and the
porous plaster glare on the astonished wayfarer in
the morning. No man deserves more unanimous
hanging, as a public enemy, than the sordid fiend
who steals the people’s recreation ground and
blots out all its loveliness in order that he may
tell them lies about his four-and-sixpenny pants
or his huge, thick hobnailed bluchers at half-a-
crown. He is a thief, which is bad ; and he is a
soulless Goth, which is far worse. The short
remedy is this : No placard, advt., calico sign, or
hoarding to be allowed on the shores of the har-
bor, or in sight of the harbor. The harbor
should bo, as far as the presence of population
will admit, a place of peace and calm and loveli-
ness—and nobody can be at peace when a fresh
bill calls to him at every headland with a blue and
red yell 24ft. high and 3Gft. long, asking him if
his stomach is out of order, and urging him to
boil somebody’s lager mackintosh for biliousness
with the name blown in the bottle.

The Victorian border town of Bchuca
seems to be about the first place to actually erect
a statue commemorating the late Queen. It is a
£4O affair and represents Cyparissus—who wept
himself into a cypress at having killed one of
Apollo’s stags. The relevance of this ancient
gentleman to Victoria is a dark and beautiful
mystery which is thrown in for the £4O without
extra charge. Anyone, now, with a cheap second-
hand statue of Psyche or the Venus di Medici
might drop in on Dawvid Syme to see if it couldn’t
be palmed off for his Queen Victoria memorial.

Melbourne’s beautiful new avenue, chris-
tened by the little Duke, and over the mainten-
ance of which the City Council and the Public
Works Department are still wrangling, has of
late been elevated into a pony-trainmg ground,
several of the unregistered pony-fakirs doing
their morning gallops there. One, invited to ex-
cuse himself, said he didn’t think he was doing
any harm, and it wasn’t everywhere he could get
a nice, straight two-mile tan track. A hint for
the needy Council: turn the concern into a bike,
foot-and-horse-racing track, rope-in Govt. House
hill, charge a shilling a head, and, with a meeting
every day, down go the city rates.

Another fire at that hideous tinder-box,
George-st. asylum, Parramatta. One of the out-
offices was consumed, and an inquiry was held to
account for the outbreak. Verdict, as usual—
nobody to blame, and no reason assigned. The
fire just happened along. The presiding magis-
trate was very severe on the apathy of Govt, in
allowing the asylum to remain standing, and shud-
deringly referred to the consequences if the fire
had broken out in the three-decker building a few
rods off. Out of eleven millions expenditure no
money can be spared to house the 700 decrepit
inmates. Govt, can spend £20,000 loan-funds to
commemorate the men who died for Cohen at
ss. Bd. a day ; not to speak of £4OO for paintings
or photos, of the Rocks, and a few hundreds here
and there for Heaven know 3 what, but nothing in
order to prevent 700 old people from being
roasted. What an odor of burning flesh will
ascend at Parramatta one of these days !

Chief Justice Darley, in speaking at the
recent N.S.W. Discharged Prisoners’ Association
meeting, assured his hearers that the separate

brutalising and not reformatory.

About twice a month S.M. Herald
devotes a couple of columns to chronicling the
doings of the 41 (less one gone bung) ridiculous
suburban councils around Sydney. Some of the
reports are printed in extenso ; hereunder is a
sample of the history-making solemnly published
by the Herald :
Alexandra.—The Zetland branch of the Simultaneous
Mission wrote thanking the council for the use of the
Town Hall and park, and forwarded 10s. for cost of gas
consumed. The letter was received, and on the motion
of Alderman Brown it was decided to hand the 10s. over
to the charwoman to compensate her for the extra labor
entailed during the mission.

The directors of Sydney Hospital have at
last abolished the system of admitting paying
patients. In future the institution will be used
strictly for what it was intended, the relief of the
sick poor in the Metropolitan area.
“Mary S.” : The woman who possesses
an office in town is a great mark for dead-beats
and small swindlers. I was interviewed, the
other day, by a distressed male, who, with half
his face blotted out with a red handkerchief, con-
fided to me, irrelevantly, that his life had been
ruined by his sister-in-law, and that he was on
terms of intimacy with all the nobility of Sydney
—showing their alleged old clothes on him as
testimonials of the same. He then produced a
portrait of one of his aristocratic relations,
which he said he had consented to raffle
for his own benefit. Could he put my
name on the list ? —a shilling was the
price. Some weeks later, he came in
great grief because the list of names had
been lost; so he was going round asking
everyone to give another shilling and to
write their names again, just to prove
that he hadn’t tried to impose on them.
Another day I was summoned by the
knock of a sorrowful working-man, who
stated that he had been working “right
in front of this’ere’ouse, ” and his lunch
had been stolen out of his basket. 4 ‘ It
seems to me that a lydy wouldn’t let a
poor ’ard-working man go without his
dinner.” The writer (whose own lunch
never exceeds 6d.) donated a shilling,
and he said, “Yus, he could make it
do.” Ten minutes later another sorrow-
ful working-man brought a claim for
vanished lunch, and, when this demand
was refused, wondered (but with gentle-
ness) if present scribess considered herself
a “lydy.”
The M.C.C. got into hot water over the
band at the cricket-match. Its agent contracted
with N.S.W. Permanent Artillery Band for the
series of Sydney matches at £0 a day—a rate far
lower than a private musicians’ band could accept,
and which works out at two or three shillings per
man per day. Minister John Forrest, at the in-
stigation of W. H. Hughes, M.P., very properly
stepped in and cancelled this sweating contract,
and the greedy club had to re-engage the per-
formers at market rates. Apart from the unfair-
ness of the business in engaging a band —the best
in the city —which can tender at, a cut rate by
reason of Govt, support, the club looked rather
mean at haggling over a fiver or so, when the
grandstand could not find elbow-room for the band,
and the attendance represented nearly £2OOO.
Another aspect of the question. The Friday
on which the band was booked to play at the test
match was also the day for the bandsmen to perform
in Hyde Park before the public, who pay them for
that purpose ; but, as is the case in almost every
instance when the band’s public and private
engagements clash, the public have been left to
divert themselves elsewhere while their band went
out on the “make.” What a farce to pay
these men to perform a public duty, and then
allow them to neglect that duty that they may
add to their income by “blacklegging” at the
expense of outside bandsmen ! If the men are
not paid sufficiently for them to live without
private engagements, then Govt, should increase
their pay.
* * * *
Sydney City Council, in answer to popular
clamor, has appointed a local man as city organist,
and, with the usual Australian contempt for the
Australian article, reduces the salary from £5OO
to £3OO. It is only reasonable to suppose that
the Australian populace which insisted on a local
man will stop away in crowds from his recitals.

At last annual meeting of Bulli (N.S.W.)
Cottage Hospital, Dr. Sturt (one of the Board)
then apparently fine and healthy, jocularly called
attention to the fatal number of 13 persons being
present. “ I wonder, now, which one of the 13
here will die within a year ? ” A few weeks after,
the speaker was dead (his favorite horse also
dropped dead on the same day). Speaking of the
fatal 13, writer of this paragraph once attended a
dinner of 13 Bohemians all told. To propitiate
the gods a dummy figure was used. It was left to
George Lambert, artist (now in Paris), to keep up
a conversation with the “silent woman ”on his
right. It was sufficient propitiation. That was
two years ago. The 13 Bohemians are still alive—
but some are married.

A Melbourne small boy has given the
police some healthy exercise over a story about
how he saw two men kill another in broad day-
light close to Moonee Ponds Creek, put his body
in a bag, and carry the bag to a cart which two
other men had in waiting. The vehicle was
drawn by a white horse (this is a point in the
boy’s favor, as a white horse is a possible animal
—if he had said a bright blue horse there would
have been an improbable air about the narrative),
and it departed at a gallop towards Footscray
with its ghastly burden. The police have got
their feet very wet and their boots deteriorated
fishing in the creek for a clue, and hunting along
the banks for bloodstains, wheel-tracks and foot-
prints, and have looked inquiringly over many
adjacent back fences, but so far nothing has come
of it.

Adelaide’s new Mayor has had his allow-
ance fixed at £lOOO, and in giving thanks made the
significant remark that every penny would be
spent on the citizens; his last term of office is
reckoned to have cost him quite three times as
much. Ex-Mayor Ware had shocking luck with
a farewell garden-party. Just before the time
fixed the only rain of the month began, and lasted
till dark, drenching all whom it did not keep
away. The whole Corporation ostentatiously
stayed away.
Ex-Mayor Ware aforesaid has a fine moral
courage. He has been generally accused of mean-
ness in office, and his corporation publicly took
him to task, afterwards refusing the usual vote of
thanks for his services as head of the council. Yet
he has said never a word in reply, neither admit-
ting, denying, or explaining anything. Just kept
quite silent, and went on as if nothing had been
said, or what had been said didn’t matter. There
is a certain strength of character about this.

At opening of Sydney Stock Exchange
this week stock-broker Palmer let what is now a
fairly well-known cat once again out of the bag.
“It had been objected,” he said, “that
the S’African war was undertaken for
the sake of the capital invested by England
in the Transvaal. If so, what then? There
could be no worthier object, for capital repre-
sented the life-blood of the community.” The B.
is pleased to record this candid confession. Pro-
vided that it is admitted that the war against the
Boers is a, war on behalf of British Capitalism,
the question as to the desirability of fighting for
British Capitalism (which is mostly represented
by foreigners) can be safely left to be argued at
another time.
“Nina Jeane” inquires whether this
throws any light on the scarcity
of the domestic servant:
Last week, in a Sydney hotel,
which considers itself of the
better class, but where there
is no “ useful ” or yard-
man kept, I found a girl
who started work at <
4.30 a.m. on week-
days and 5.30 a.m.
on Sundays.
Every morning
(including Sunday)
she had to scrub
out and wash down
the two bars, pub-
lic and private,
after which she
cleaned the boots of
the family and a limited
number of boarders,
and made missus tea
and toast to sustain
her till rising-
time and break-
fast. Then she
had “ to assist
with the cook-
ing, do all the
scullery-work, act
ns chambermaid and
housemaid, and do
the whole of the
laundry - work of
the establish-
ment, which
meant ironing
every night of
lhe week. Also,
while ironing she
had to mind
“the kid ” of the
house while its
proper nurse as-
sisted missus in
the bar. If the in-
fant was asleep she could go
to bed at ten, but if that
infant was awake she had
to stay up to tell it about
the little pigs going to
market till nursey and
mama had finished
beer - pumping. For
all this she received
11s. 6d. per week.
She was from the
country, and now
she has gone back
determined to do
anything in the
future rather than /
accept domestic
service in Sydney.
This particular
grog - emporium
never engages any but
country girls, to be
paid fortnightly, and if they attempt to leave with-
out giving a fortnight’s notice they are told that
they thereby forfeit all wages due. So the slave is
secured for a month, when she disappears right out of the
profession of “ slavey ” for ever.

A Victorian damsel, a few days ago,
charged her father with a horrible offence, and,
though he was undefended, a simple cross-
examination showed that “there was another,”
and that the interesting young person had, to her
grandmother, blamed this other for her “ trouble.”
The father was promptly acquitted. Nothing, of
course, happened to the girl. They play the game
with loaded dice.
* * m m
A blushing damsel faced a Melbourne
Bench, the other day, on a charge of being an
unregistered baby-keeper. She was a single girl,
and was invited to explain why she had repre-
sented herself as married and had adopted a casual
infant. Her lawyer assured the Bench that she
got the baby to convert hard-hearted relatives,
who had intervened between herself and her
young man, to the belief that that young man
must forthwith “make her an honest woman.”
On Saturday at N.S. W Society of Artists’
rooms were exhibited half-a-dozen pictures, mostly
S ortraits, by Mr. H. J. Thaddeus, a painter from
Ingland, or rather Ireland. The chief of these
canvases, “La Obedienza,” an historical picture,
shows much weakness in the treatment of the
’ °bes and background. But the central figure,
(lab of Pope Leo XII., has plenty of life and
character. The Pope is given the face of an
eagle with a sense of humor: masterful, good-
humoredly cynical; a clever Pope must look like
that. Just as good in its way is the countenance
of the Pope’s nephew, a plump, jolly, soldier
figure. Several other portraits by the same
painter were shown—those of Speaker Gully, of the
Duke of Cambridge, and of Lady Howard
De Walden were the most notable. There is
no doubt as to Mr. Thaddeus’ talent for
portraiture, and perhaps his much inferior
treatment of fabrics and accessories is a device to
concentrate the interest on the faces that he pour-
trays. It is comforting to see that the work of
our Australian Longs taff is in no wise eclipsed
when put beside these picked pieces of an English
portrait-painter. On Saturday Cardinal Moran
was among those who saw Mr. Thaddeus’pictures.
Perhaps the fine Pope painting will then be kept
in Australia as an altar-piece, for which it is
emininently suitable.

Bumbledom had a day out at Melb.
Benevolent Asylum lately and enjoyed itself
thoroughly. The committee and committee-men
and women of other institutions gathered and were
thoughtfully accommodated on chairs while the
poor old derelicts were put through their paces.
Those able to walk (including the blind and the

was no earthly reason for this degrading spectacle.

Love and loot. A returned cohentingenter
was recently sued in Maoriland for breach of
E remise. It came out that the engagement ring
ad been looted from a S’African farm.
N.S.W. Board of Health is “considering’
the filthy habit of butchers wrapping up their
wares in stale newspaper. This unclean trick has
had support in various influential quarters— the
sale of “ waste is quite an item in the profits of
the blanket dailies, and at least one N.S.W.
politician used to add to his allowance by
the sale to a butcher of Govt. Gazettes
and other official publications, supplied ,
to him m almost any quantity on de-
mand. But it is hard to understand
how any decent community could
tolerate it for long. Clean, white
paper, too, is so cheap that there is
no excuse for enclosing the raw joint
in ancient “rags.” Just think of
taking home a pound of mystery-sausages
wrapped in the much-clawed report of a
divorce-case.
A certain totally “ h’’-less Melbourne
beak had before him, the other
day, an Italian sailor, charged with
the usual two d’s. Sergeant:
“Was you drunk?” Prisoner
(vacantly): “I no un’erstan’
Inglees.” Beak: “Whatdid
’e 'say ? Tell ’im to put ’is

and speak like a ’uman

he don’t understand Eng-
lish.” Beak (with a por-
tentous frown):“ Now, my
man, just take inter yer ’ed
what I’m sayin’ ter yer.
Was yer drunk or was you not
drunk ? ” Prisoner (grinning,
and holding up two grimy fin-
gers): “Yah ! two long beer!”
Beak : “Fined 55., or 12 hours—
mind,Jnot so much for bein’ drunk,
as for prevaricatin’ by sayin’ as ’ow
yer didn’t hunderstand Henglish.”
Concerning Victoria’s new Governor :
On January Ist, 1901, a.d., the poor little glory of
Australian State governorship departed this life. New
Governors are being shipped to fill the local billets, mili-
tary men of more or less “ distinction,” with a strut and
a mannah, hut the multitude will set no store by these
unnecessary new-ehums. They are beside the mark.
’Opetoun is the mark. A gratifying result of Federa-
tion in Melbourne was visible last week when State-Gov.
Clarke came to hand, at St. Kilda pier, and was driven to
town forswearing-in purposes along thesame route that had
been taken by the awful Brassey some years ago. Brassey
of yore scored a great triumphal progress as compared with
Clarke’s journey to the Exhibition Building. Brassey
was treated as an event by crowds in the streets and
effusive loyalists on doorsteps and balconies. Clarke
went for a mere circumstance. Few people troubled to
put themselves in the way of seeing him pass, and, ex-
cept at those points where the idlers amounted to a
cluster, there was never a cheer. The “ typical Austra-
lian welcoming ” of a new State Governor from England
is going to be silent for the future as regards citizens in
the street. Probably a revival of “demonstration” will
mark the drive-past of native Australian Governors when
Time produces them.
A big effort was made to work up a show at the
Exhibition Building, but some hundreds of tickets for
reserved seats—out of the 4000 odd issued—seem to have
fallen on stony ground. The invitees stayed away in
such large numbers that back-seat holders came forward
to fill the gaps. Some grew tired of waiting for the
mislaid potentate and slunk away, leaving the “ missus ”
to sit out the function. The intense Britishness of it
all was rather irritating to the unofficial portion of
the audience. Municipal councillors came along by the
dozen in knee-breeches and long, warm robes, as though
they were perspiring together to excite ridicule. A cold
climate and a sense of old tradition are excuses for this
civic masquerade in the land of its origin, but as Mel-
bourne doesn’t trace a line of aldermen back to the
Crusades, the mummers who assess the rates from the
corner of Collins-street ought to be restrained from wear-
ing robes when the glass registers three figures in the
shade.
The display of old-world trappings was painfully
general. Lieut.-Gov. Madden sat in splendour to watch
his sun going down, and Barton wore an aspect of con-
scious gilt, which won' no pity for him, seeing that
Peacock contrived to get through his part of the job in a
thin frock coat and a loose, jaunty style. Why
this striving after British effect? What has
even Australian “ loyalty ” in its official bear-
ings got to do with Windsor uniform? Twelve
hundred school-girls provided the one true touch of
Australian nature, not by their sweet young warble of
“ God Save ” and “ Rule Britannia,” but by their free-
and-easy bearing as they marched to the organ-gallery.
The gew-gaws and formalities of grovel looked altogether
foreign to the community which had raised those 1200
women-children, so different from the timid maidens of
Gov. Clarke’s country. There was not one meek and lowly
curtsey-dropper in the whole crowd. They were game to
rush upon the dais and pinch his Excellency’s leg, if the
conductor had given them the word.
Sir George Sydenham Clarke—The Bulletin must
call him Syd. and his wife Lady Gov. Clarke, to distin-
guish them from their local namesakes —is much the
same cut of military person as the little Major-General or
Colonel Somebody or other who played Commandant of
the Vic. Forces ten years ago. He was a trim, bald-
headed, bantammy personage who soon passed out of
memory because he had no feature worth recolleoting.
Gov. Syd. Clarke bears a general resemblance to that
unremarkable has-been. A short K.C.M.G., with a
neat little nose, married to a tall, stately dame
whose aquiline feature spells character, and whose
•daughter takes after papa. Lady Gov. Clarke is
the most leading-lady Melbourne has ever met since
“ dear Lady Loch ” filled the bill. She came ashore in an
airy bonnet arrangement that symphonised with her fine,
upstanding silver hair. Threads of black among the
silvery whiteness of hair and bonnet ; graceful deport-
ment, slender waist for her age, and an eye that sums up
the situation. The limelight will be on my Lady Silver-
hair every time she takes the social stage.

people who knew very little about wealth till the
old cattle king’s pile came their way, and their

barristers is something awful. What with the
best girl, the law, the church and the property
agent, the hot sun is shining on Tyson’s snowball,
and it is spreading out to fertilise the earth.

Some members of N.S.W. Law Institute
intend to challenge, before that body, attorney T.
M. Slattery’s assertion that it is a “common prac-
tice ” for solicitors to represent vendor and pur-
chaser in a property transaction, with the implied
duty to seek, on behalf of the former, as high a
price as possible : on behalf of the latter, as low a
price as possible.

The Bulletin's term “ cohentingents,’
applied to Australia’s S’African troops, originated,
of course, in this paper’s disgust at finding
Australian pluck and muscle enlisted in the
service of the cold-blooded liars and exploiters of
London Stock Exchange. It was one Levy, an
ex-Australian, and his friends (several Cohens) who
first suggested a body of Australian bush men for
service in the golden country. But London Jewish
Chronicle innocently asserts that the “cohen-
tingent jest ” generally current in Australia is a
striking testimony to the prominent part borne
in the S’African war not only by English and
S’African Jews, but by their brethren in all parts
of the Empire. “ Cohentiugent ” certainly wasn’t
invented to mark the number of Jews who went
to the wax'. It was invented to mark the number
of Jews who stayed away from the war and egged
other people to go. This paper pointed out that
long ago one Jew died for the Gentiles, and that
now, to pay for that death, the Gentiles were
dying for the Jews at the rate of 60 per cent,
compound interest extending over 1900 years.

Some Bathurst (N.S.W.) Jay Pees, an-
noyed at Attorney-General Wise cheating them
out of a sectarian shindy by his dignified rebuke
of Police-Magistrate O’Neill’s wild hurroo about
“ the godless public schools,” called a meeting to
further discuss the matter. Mr. O’Neill’s report
to bis Department on the incident was circulated
at the meeting. Some extracts :
Already the whisper is abroad, “ O’Neill will be shifted
over this,” but O’Neill, conscious of no wrong-doing on
his own part, and strong in the belief that he will suffer
no injustice at the hands of the Department he hasfiong
and faithfully served, stands erect with folded arms,
answering bigotry with the eloquence of silent contempt.
From a mother’s lips, in the far-away past, I received my
life motto : “ Always act the man,” and to-day she looks
down upon me from her place in heaven, when I say
the man does not exist who can point to a single incident
in my history that is darkened by the shadow of sec-
tarianism.
Now, could anyone have the heart to take a man
with such a gift of “ iloquence” seriously ?

The other day the cable announced that

British officer (the commander of the Connaught

smell pretty high.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
*, _ . Sydney, December 17, 1901.
Mt Dear Arini, —
In spite of all that our horse-poets have sung,
the cricket bat must be dearer to the people of
this State than the horse. Forty thousand people
at lasfcSaturday’s test match; close upon £5OOO gate-
money taken ! The Englishmen said that the
sight-from the centre of the field was the most
r : mark able of its kind they had ever seen. They
really enjoy the barracking, advice, and criticism
given from the shilling enclosure, and find them-
selves listening and waiting for the jokers’ half-
truths. Little paper bags df dust, which those in
the back seats oarry to hurl at others who obstruct
the view by standing up, also have a charm for
“them Englishmen” when well-aimed. I learn
that the Australian cricketers have nick-names,
more or less appropriate. When you hear a crioketer
cioaking of “Father and Mother and Gertie,”
you think of a nice family group, until you learn
that Darling is “Father,” Kelly “Mother,” and
H. Trumble “ Gertie.”
To secure a seat in the Ladies’ Reserve one had
to be there by 10 o’clock. Lunch-baskets were
plentiful. Those who had brought supplies tried
to keep the seats of those who had not, whilst the
latter-struggled into the tea-room. A large per-
centage of the women didn’t really know the
wicket from the bowling-crease, or the pitch
from that other pitch that can’t be touched
with safety. Fm speaking of the crush on the
lawn. Non-cricketesses on the Stand sustained
themselves by studying the toques in front of
them. One could see little but millinery in such a
crush.
Froeking at the match was gorgeous, but not
tiff the play was over, and the silken trains and
the oceans of'flounces were billowing across the
dusty road to cabs, carriages, ’busses and trams,
could they be fairly seen. It was a flood of frocks
of all shapes, shades, and grades of beauty—white
predominating—but they never took form long
enough to make any distinct impression. One
dainty creation swung a moment on the step of
its owner’s carriage—a pointed overskirt, open-
vested corsage of the palest of sage-green cloth :
three‘lines of the finest of black velvet ran round
the outlines, and the skirt was slashed with cerise
pink; -the ehiffou that gathered round the
neck and billowed up from the open corsage
was pink, with a toque to match. The wearer
just stood on the step long enough to reveal that
from the feathertip of her toque to the tan-shod
foot with its embroidered hose, she was perfect.
The dust and grime of the sweltering afternoon
had passed her bv. Floral muslins were every-
where. A girl swept by in something that looked
like superfine Assam silk, flounced by itself and
set off with a turquoise-studded belt, the joints of
which were petals of a lily; her biscuit-colored
hat was lost in a wilderness of chiffon and roses.
Three girls, hanging en the arms of johnnies who
looked like animated window-figures from their
pink cheeks to their varnished boots, were in fawn
silk. When the sun shone on it the fawn turned
red, and in the shade it glowed like a tarnished
emerald, and gave the fluffy trinity a chameleonic
air.
Lord Hopetouh, attended by Captain Walling-
ton and Major Philson, was present on Friday
and Saturday, coming early and staying late, and
reading the evening papers in the pauses of the
game. He strolled through the members’ reserve
with George Reid (the latter in an ugly little
German-bun hat that was calculated to for ever
discredit the M‘Million's importing policy), and
M.L, A. Jessop's loud voice oalled for a cheer for
“ the best man in Australia.” Then some cheered
the Governor and some the Dry-Dog.
Rosehill race meeting was largely advertised as
Ladies’ Day. Perhaps that is why men went
there in train-loads, and women stayed away. A
few unswerving feminine horse-lovers, who would
probably rather go to a race meeting at Mil-
parinka than see King Edward himself at the
wicket and his heir bowling, were present. But
the keen, gusty wind that blew over the roses and
the hills had few coiffures to ruffle. Half
the “Florodora ” sextette wore out the afternoon
on the lawn and in the paddock ; one of them in
a pretty green linen, another in a “simple white
muslin,” tucked and lace-trimmed into costliness.
In a second-class carriage (the firsts were rushed
by men, it being ladies’ day, you know), coming
home, a middle-aged widow, who had the look of
having done hard work in the Never Never, gave
her reasons for not re-marrying. “Me husband
was as good a man as ever lived, and a woman
doesn’t draw two big prizes in a sweep—at least
it ain’t likely. Tf I’d a bad husband I’d have tried
a second one.” Lightning never does strike twice
in the same place.
Our new Mayoress, Mrs. Tom Hughes, second
daughter of the late Dr. Gilhooley, is tall, fair,
brown-haired, and young. She is a smart dresser,
with a good figure, and in her unmarried days
was by way of being an artist. A member of the
St. Cecilia choir, she is a singer and player of
skill, and a philanthropist of note. St. Margaret’s
Maternity Home is one of her pet charities. Mrs.
Hughes has two sons. Her sister is also married
to a Hughes—two brothers married two sisters.
The position of Mayoress has always struck
me as a singularly unpleasant one. In her
short term of office Mayoress Graham acquired
a worried look, a business-like voice, and a
hurried walk. She was always rushing from one
charity meeting to another, or presiding at a circle
to raise funds to send the latest infantile prodigy
on the piano to Europe, or opening a bazaar in a
hot, dusty suburb, or being At Home at the
Town Hall to a horde of persons who said (as they
say of everybody in turn) that she was very un-
fitted for her position if she wasn’t able to keep
np the conversation with them at the point where
it was left off at the last At Home.
Exoerpt from Mrs. Doherty’s reminiscences of
places where she had in her youth officiated as
“ general ” :—“ It was all right at Mr. Barandy’s;
everything up to the knocker; no ’ot Sunday
dinner, they bein’ very religious. And the boss
wasn’t a bit stuck up, as ’is ’obby was making red-
’ot love to servant-girls.”
As Shakespeare has it “the readiness is aIL”
At a recent picnie, a rising young Sydney dentist
had the carving of a finely-skewered turkey, the
skewers of which sternly resisted extraction until
at last Mr. Pultusky, with a professional wave of
the hand, drew from his pocket a pair of forceps,
and, telling the turkey to “keep still, Miss, and
I won’t hurt you,” had the skewers out in an
instant.
In one of the larger West Coast towns (Tas-
mania), where everybody knows everybody and
mostly everyone lives in two-roomed cottages, a
lady, a recent arrival, was bemoaning the faot
that there were absolutely no class distinctions.
“In fact,’’she went on hopelessly, “there have
been women calling upon me who admit having
milked cows and other things ” —probably ducks.
Consider the inappropriateness of things as
sometimes carried out in Australian country parts.
At a certain township a grand conoert was held in
aid of the local cemetery. Three comio songs and
a comic duet were among the items. Possibly
the comic contributors lost sight of their objective,
else their items must have sounded tragic. At
another entertainment, the recitation “ Moloney’s
Cat ” was followed by the singing of the Doxology.
And the queer association of ideas that some
people have ! Heard a widow planning to raise
funds to provide a headstone for her husband’s
grave and to get her youngest daughter a set of
artificial teeth.
A little girl friend of mine recently showed me
her essay on the commandment, “ Honor thy
father and thy mother,” wherein she set forth
that children should pray for the “ warfare ” of
their parents. She also states that the “lang-
wige ” somp children, especially the elder ones,
use is “ dispeotful,” and gives, as a sample, the
five words, in semi-phonetic spelling, that are
always handed on a slip of paper to the Bench
when a blushing policeman comes into court to
give evidenoe, which “ can’t be spoken, your
Honor.” In giving synonyms for a list of names
she described wedlock as “a cheap kind of pad-
lock that you can buy for sixpence when it’s
rusty.”
Why don’t the New South Wales Railway
Commissioners reserve special tram - cars for
women ? The indiscriminate tram is a
horror. A woman with an expensive, beautiful
dress gets in and takes the seat just vacated by
the man who has been asphalting the pavement,
her nearest neighbor a Chinaman with vegetable
stains on his rags and smelling like a dirty cellar.
Both have as much right to their seats in the car
as the lady, and perhaps the smoker is full, but
her expensive dress is ruined. It is the man who
stands on the car platform and expectorates all
over the space near the doorway that piles up the
horror. Awhile ago I drew a conductor’s atten-
tion to such a man. The car—an electric one—was
not a smoker, and he was alone on the platform and
had the roadway on either side of him for a cus-
pidor. His amazement at being requested to
“ stop that or get off ” was comic, and he got off,
but the state of the platform was sickening.
It seems to be the custom for German-bred
people and nuns to kiss on both cheeks. On a
reception-day at a convent you’ll see the old-girl
pupils and their mothers receiving the two-cheek
peck with unfailing regularity on arrival and de-
parture. When the Duke of York got back to
London after his tour his father “ embraced him
warmly and kissed him on both cheeks,” which
salute, the reporters called “a hearcy British
greeting.” This “British” greeting you mav
see any week on the out or incoming Teutonic
liners. It may be a kingly custom ; more likely it
was just the German blood showing.
Mdlle. Maud Celinski begins a series of musical
fantasies entitled “The Arcadian Nights” at Syd-
ney Palace Theatre on Saturday next. Her pro-
framme, bearing the names of illustrious poets to
e “illustrated,” looks very attractive.
The death in Florence (Italy) of Mr. Robert
Prendergast, the well-known brewer, will send
his wife back to Sydney, where until two years
ago she was the leader of R.O. society, and noted
for her charities and wonderfully youthful figure.
Mrs. Prendergast is a sister of Sir Nicholas
Fitzgerald, of Melb. She has four sons. The
eldest is assayer on the Mt. Morgan mine, the
second is on one of the Prendergast stations, and
the other two.are at school in England.
Miss Hilda Mulligan, a fragile-looking, fair
little 19-years-old soprano, gave her first profes-
sional recital before the Professional Musicians’
Association last week. The room was too small
to allow her voice to be heard to advantage, but
its promise is uncommon, and, when funds are
forthcoming, she will go the way of other song-
birds for study. Miss Mulligan is a grand-niece
of Vincent Wallace, of “Maritana” fame; and
if history repeats itself, has got the right sort of
name to work a boom with.
Among the passengers who left for the laud of
wooden nutmegs and medical and religious fakes
by the Ventura on Tuesday was a palmist person
who is sent to America by subscription to make
further study of Christian Science under Mrs.
Eddy, the lady with the enormous banking
account. A palmist is just about the proper
person—that is, if no crystal-gazer is available
—to study under Mrs. Eddy. Mr. and Mrs.
Bernard Wise went to Maoriland by the same
steamer. While Mrs. Wise looks round the
Sounds and things, the K.C. will study the work-
ing of the M.L. Arbitration Act, and won’t give
himself any recreation at all.
Mary Eddy, announced by Sydney D.T. as the
“ founder and discoverer of Christian Science ’
but not very enthusiastically described by an
Australian lady-worshipper of her cult, who went
on a pilgrimage to the apostle—is said to be worth
about £1,500,000. Exploiting a good idea—which
she didn’t discover, but which is older than
Christianity and nearly as old as Thought—Mrs.
Eddy surrounded it with the hokus-pokus mum-
mery which seems essential to a new experiment
in the religious line, and so makes magnificent
money. There are quite a number of Christian
Scientists in Sydney, but since the report above-
mentioned of one enthusiast who personally visited
the high-priestess, they don’t subscribe nearly
so much to Mrs Eddy’s fortune.
Sydney palmists are at present exhibiting pic-
tures of General Buffer’s hand, and pointing out —
now J—the lines which indicated that, “through
indiscreet loquacity,” he would fall from high
office. How marvellously accurate these past
futurists are—after the fact!
A belated tale of the Census to hand: The
squatter was filling in the paper, and one of his
female servants had given her age as 34 ; he hinted
that he wouldn’t object to a few years subtracted,
but She persisted, and finally he urged that
a misstatement of her years would stand in the
way of her old-age pension. “That’s another view,”
she replied ; “put down what I am—s 3.” Concern-
ing old-age pensions. The authorities, in making
inquiries, have brought out some funny points.
Young men of 30 have married ladies of 70 or
over, and the latter are now applying for pensions,
having settled property on their young husbands.
This anecdotelet is recommended to notice of
the Societies of Art in our midst: Two women
were looking in a shop-window at a picture to be
disposed of by art union. “What a lovely pic-
ture !” said one. “ What is it called ?” “ Called 1”
said the other, laboriously reading the particulars
attached, “ Oh, it’s an art ‘ unknown ’ ! ”
If any politician wants to discover a royal road
to political eminence, let him go round among the
oheap streets and lanes, and interview the aged
and broken women who live on their old-age pen-
sions and the proceeds of a little washing. He
could collect enough pathetio fact to wreck any
Ministry that would even hint at reducing the
present miserable allowance by a fraction of a
farthing.
Concerning dogs: I know a lovable, middle-
aged collie, owned by a first-class family. He has
a curious fad. A year or so ago he picked from a
dustheap an old 21b. jam tin. It was bashed and
riddled with holes, but he brought it home, and
has never allowed it out of his sight since. He
plays with it all day, and takes it to bed with him
at night. Once someone threw it a parish away,
but collie tracked it down and recovered it. He
met other jam tins in his search, quite new ones,
that had once held marmalade, witn pretty labels
stiff adhering, but he was not seduced from his
first and battered love.
This is the 20th season of the Sydney Lieder-
tafel, and it is an institution that all music-lovers
would do well to join. The annual subscription
is only £1 Is., for which trifling sum the subscriber
receives three tickets for each of three grand con-
certs, and one gentleman’s ticket and one lady’s
ticket for each smoke - concert —which is the
cheapest supply of good music that I know of.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The State Parliament and its feminine de-
tachment were just in the humor to beam on an
imported Governor after several hours of the
breezy ozone on the Hygeia, with luncheon in-
cluded. But after past experiences of-the swagger
of the Brasseys, the amateurish stiffness of the
Maddens, and the aloofness of the Countess, they
were nearly paralysed with delight at finding the
Clarkes so very affable—say a little too affable to
last. The bows and wreathed smiles extended
by the new arrivals to the hand-shakers, and
vice versa, made the straight, stiff aide-de-camp in
the rear smile over and over again. He contrived
for a long time to keep his countenance, but,
finding the gushing shakes increasing in warmth
and vigor, he let his laugh go, and defied the
Fates. Mrs. F. C. Mason, who always takes
things quietly, and Mrs. Peacock, who does ditto,
presented posies to the Lady and Miss Clarke, and
made little fuss about it. It was the oleagin-
ous stream of M.’s.P. and their fair attachments
that made the first reception of the Clarkes the
most gushing and effusive affair in all the world.
The State law-makers were so delighted to find
an imported Somebody to wring their hands
warmly and look proud and pleased to meet them
that they nearly fell on his neck and wept.
“Like most men of diminutive stature, His
new Ex. has a habit of calling himself to attention
and standing right up to his inches every now and
then. At these times he spreads his shoulders
and straightens his back tiff he looks almost tall.
Miss Clarke reminds one just a little of Mrs.
Freeman Thomas—of the same height, the same
build, the same complexion, something of the
same vivacity. Miss Clarke is a factor for our
girls to take into account. She has more
attractiveness than was dreamt of by those
who absorbed accounts of her accomplishments,
her musical talent, her ‘ model daughter ’ attain-
ments. But the Governor’s one ewe lamb is fresh
and frisky—despite all this weight of learning and
seminary gilt. One is prepared to be interested.
‘Yes, they had such a delightful voyage, and were
so anxious to get here; and are sure they will be
so happy here, and they know such a lot about
Australia,’ etc., etc.
“ One snap-shotter in skirts turned her, camera’s
eye on the Hygeia at St. Kilda pier, and gave the
astonished Clarkes an idea of Woman’s position
at the front here. The Pier, you must know, was
cleared of the crowd. Only the blue-jackets were
left, and several military offioers with much gilt
about their inflated chests. The camera-fiends
formed a separate detachment, and this one
vigilant female fronted the lot, with her instru-
ment of torture. The hand that adjusts ths
camera rules the fashionable world.
“ Up at the Exhibition Building, Sassiety dames
frizzled in ill-humor and prickly-heat during the
long hours of waiting. Treasurer Turner’s wife
alone sat smiling all through the ordeal, undaunted
and alert. Her hubby, on the other hand, let his
drowsy head droop upon his gilt-edged Ul l^° rm
and forgot the World, the Flesh, and the
Governor. John Forrest, a colossal figure in gut,
grew more like a beet-root every moment, but
cracked jokes and drew many a laugh from nis
tired neighbors. Fringes drooped, faces grew
moist, fans fell limp from apathetic fingers, ana
womankind sat inert, tired of everything. Ad-
jacent chiffons ceased to interest them, complexion
veils at last failed to court conjecture, the long,
sultry hours took the gilt off vanity and made the
whole world kin. In the front of the dais, Judge
Williams’ scarlet robes held their own, and Miss
Muriel Williams scored above all. the frilly
frockers by a black and white creation, as pro-
nounced as the capital head-lines of an American
yellow journal.
“Sassiety made the acquaintance of the new
Exes, at Wednesday’s polo match on the new
Caulfield course, where a syndicate of swagger
sports now booms polo as it was never boomed
before. Some of the smartest rode out on highly-
polished hacks—amongst them Miss Blanche
Watson, of the hunting clan, and Miss ‘ Beaulieu ’
Buckley, just fresh from globe-trotting. . The
Govt. House contingent drove out with their full
ice-cream escort and outriders. The new Gov.,
quietly dressed in tweeds, deepened the previous
day’s impression that he will do very nicely if he
doesn’t incline towards militarism. When intro-
duced to a damsel fair or buckramed dame, Sir
George gives his hat a great sweep through the
atmosphere, bows his bare crown, and falls into an
easy position for a chat. Something of a gallant
he seems.
“Lady Clarke and her daughter might have
been but just returning from their reception, for
they wore the same frocks, the same vivacious air,
and the same smiles as on the previous day.
The party was enclosed by an impromptu
fence of wooden rails. Mrs. Philson left her little
hubby to look after himself, while she talked to
the Clarkes, swinging as she did so on the door
of the carriage. One of the Madden girls, in
billowy blue, hovered close to the party —not yet
used to being herded beyond the V.R. limits with
the vulgar majority. Sister Ruby peregrinated
with a youth. By the way, youths—the
clean, lisping species—are the fashion. No
smart woman who respects her reputation
in the gay world would be seen without one or
two of these callow danglers. One haughty
matron had two of the kind, and also, for a time,
the brand-new aide-de-camp, Captain Browning
(who, in busby and tinware, looks like Charles
Kenningham, doing comic opera ; and, in tweeds,
like a pretty, pouting pet addicted to the society
of his elders). At tea-time, he procured straw-
berries for Miss Muriel Cumming, and carried
lumps of sugar for S’Rupert’s dame. Mrs. Harry
Payne—a Toorak sporting dame, coming to the
fore rapidly—was one of the frilliest of the crowd,
in pink silk foulard, with expensive elaborations
of applique.
“ Mrs. L. C. Mackinnon and Mrs. W. Leonard,
who hosted it at the afternoon tea, where a
supply of ices and creams and wine-cups proved
as inexhaustible as the Tariff amendments, had
the most to say, naturally enough, to our new
Exes. Mrs. Leonard rolled some rich jokes off
her ready Milesian tongue, and sported a par-
ticularly smart costume of butcher-blue linen.
The Doorman Bayles’ dogcart was one of the
trickiest turns-out. The Frank Madden family
filled a brougham as seriously as all the profes-
sional talent might the mourning coach of a rich
patron. Mrs. Walter Cold ham, in bright yellow
muslin, was conspicuous to the eye.
“ Lord Hopetoun lost his jaundiced look after a
few rounds of polo, and later on shed his coat.
The sight of the exalted figure in silk shirt and
vest was a sight that the full-bosomed dames of
the gathering sighed to behold. He reminded
them of a thin paling.
“The Waxellency had a final splutter all to
himself on Monday of last week. During
the most crowded time of the ‘ Block ’
an orderly rode down Collins-street with
a rattle of spurs, blowing a shrill whistle.
Every ear was attracted, and every eye
was turned in his direction. Then all beheld a
carriage in which the Waxellency sat like a very
mighty monarch doing himself proud to give this
last glimpse of a great Representative of Royalty
to the people. A laugli went up and down
Collins-street and all round the Block.
“The Madden entourage marched in to ‘Gor
Save ’ accompaniment for the last time for a long
while, at Mrs. Green’s fancy hop, last Monday.
They went very slowly to their palmy place in the
balcony, as if to spin out the sweet time; whereat
there was a good deal of tittering among the
women, who have been hurt at the Maddens’
profound admiration for themselves.
“At this dance, Miss Florrie Green’s representa-
tion of the enchanting siren, in delicious shell-like
frills of black, heliotrope and silver coruscations,
was a triumph of dexterous posturing. After
her three successive dances of breath-catching
charm she completely collapsed.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
According to a country paper, Jimmy
Governor’s widow has married a half-caste.
The father of N.S.W. Judge Heydon and
solicitor Louis Heydon worked as compositor on
the Sydney Monitor in the forties.
If B. R. Wise climbs the N.S.W. bench,
his judgments ought to have a literary flavor;
and that will be almost a novelty in Australia.
N.S.W. Speaker M‘Court learned type-
setting in the office of Thomas Garrett, afterwards
Lands Minister and candidate for the Speaker’s
chair.
On Nov. 26, N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley
completed his 15th year as C. J. His Honor can
now, at any moment, retire on a pension-of 7-10ths
of his salary.
Mr. W. P. Crick, who announced himself,
a few weeks ago, as a mainstay of N.S.W. Par-
liamentary refreshment-room, is now said to be a
total abstainer.
Archdeacon Langley, nominated to be first
Bishop of Bendigo, is brother of Sydney Arch-
deacon Langley. Both followed secular businesses
throughout early manhood.
Mr. Justice Parker (W.A.) declined to sit
in a recent case, as relatives of his were appearing
for one of the parties. He would not sit in any
case where his kinsmen were counsel.
Lady Barkly, widow of the highest-paid
Governor that any Australian province ever
had, is said to be hard-up in London, her only
income being a £75 Civil List pension.
The Rev. J. J. Kenny, whose name
figured in the Coningham case, may have had his
course of conduct approved at Rome, but his
mission, at all events for some years to come, will
lie in South America.
During N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley’s
year’s leave offabsence, Mr. M. H. Stephen, senior
Pusine Judge, may be'acting C.J.; and Mr. R. D.
Pring an acting Judge, with a permanent appoint-
ment to follow—if B. R. Wise elects to stand out
of the way.
Dr. Joseph Stapleton, found dead at
Wallsend (N.S.W ) the other day, was a brilliant,
though eccentric, doctor, with some reputation as
a surgeon, and a hobby for literary study. He
was said to be one of the best Shakespearean
soholars in Australia.
Memo, for Mayor Hughes : Sydney’s two
latest ex-Mayors (Graham and Matthew Harris)
both lost their Parliamentary seats and their
Mayoralties almost simultaneously. By the way,
Mr. Hughes (not yet 39) is the youngest alderman
who lias reached the chair.
Judge! Walton, the newly - appointed
Judge of the King’s Bench, London, is
brother of storekeeper Walton, of Rock
hampton (Q.). Latter was one of the
first settlers on the Barcoo.
*n 65, Melb. Argus tried the ex-
periment of having a Presbyterian
parson—Jarrett—for its editor. His
reverence only lasted six months : he dis-
tinguished himself by writing a leader in
which he recommended, as a cure for all
the ills of the body politic, a careful
study of THE BOOK.
SOMETHING STRONG.
THE PUSH MONARCH (to intoxicated old gent,
who is vainly trying to rise from the ground):
“’Ere! I say, you silly old gheeser, why
don’t you lean on your bloomin’ breath?”
Among Australasia’s big dividend-re-
ceivers, one name is somehow rarely mentioned —
that of William Hart, who owns the biggest half
of the grand old Tasmania gold-mine. He has
averaged between £4OO and £5OO per week for the
last 22 years—which is very high up amongst
Australia’s records.
Discussing in M.L. House of Reps, the
item “ £l5OO to the Premier for expenses con-
nected with the coronation ” one member referred
to the Premier’s Jubilee trip expenditure as
“some £2O a day, although champagne and all the
other necessaries of life were found by the
Imperial Govt.” The necessities of a Radica
Premier !
Judge Docker (N.S.W.) is a judicial mar-
tinet whose cruel sentences and insolent abuse
of juries are alternated with studies in amateur
photography. Judge Windeyer, when' he wasn’t
hanging a man, delighted to attend and weep at
sentimental amateur theatricals.
One Argue (by name and by nature) has
been lecturing in N.S.W. recently. Some of his
subjects: “ John Norton and Morality ”; “John
Norton and Conscience”; and John Norton in
various other ways. And it is wonderful how the
name of John Norton draws a crowd.
Strange how the prefix “ Sir ” kills Aus-
tralian politicians. “Sir” G. Dibbs, “Sir” A.
Stuart, “Sir” J. Dickson, “Sir” G. Berry,
“Sir” J. Forrest, “Sir” J. Abbott, “Sir” H.
Nelson, and a score of others all seem to have
been slain politically by the charm or bane.
Ex-serrior constable A. L. M. Steele, the
Nemesis of the Kelly gang, recently retired from
the force, but still resides at Wangaratta, Vic.,
within coo-ee of the meeting of the waters of the
Ovens and King. He now cultivates garden
blooms, and is a noted prize-taker at flower-shows.
Australian explorer Eyre, who died the
other day in England aged 86, incurred much
Exeter Hall odium in ’65, when Governor of
Jamaica, by his rigorous suppression of a black
rebellion. Eyre was recalled and never employed
again. Nor was he ever, like the other retired
Governors, knighted. Eyre’s opinion on a White
Australia would have been valuable.
At Ashburton (M.L.), when Premier Sed-
don was parading with the Yorks, some one in the
crowd shouted, “Good old Dick!” whereupon
R.S. smiled and bowed graciously. But when a
beery individual yelled “Goo’ ole Bun-Tuck!”
he frowned and snorted “ something awful.” By
the way, Seddon, who now weighs over 20st., has
of late been establishing in % variety of ways his
claim to be regarded as a purely-oomic personage.
If Rev. W. J. Carr-Smith does not get the
Bishopric of Goulburn, he will shortly warm himself
with- an apron somewhere else. Lord Beauchamp
took him to his bosom, and bragged of him over
the oountry as the future Archbishop of Sydney,
and it is wonderful how closely C.E. clergy and
upper-class laity notice the words of a Governor.
Beauchamp had it in mind for a while to teach
catechism in Carr-Smith’s church, but was
reasoned out of it by more sensible people.
The unfortunate General Hector Mac-
donald-dropped in at Fremantle on Dec. 2 on his
way to England in the Ormuz, and though he had
but five hours at his disposal, underwent a
welcome by the Frpmantle Municipal Council,
another by the Caledonian Society, a luncheon at
Govt. House, and a reception and presentation in
Perth. He returned to his steamer richer by a
possum-rug, a gold-mounted jarrah walking-stick,
and a portentous poetic greeting in Gaelic.
Melbourne Age has had a good succession
of editors, beginning with David Blair (a ship-
mate from England with the late Dr.
Garran, of S.M. Herald), who was
a first-class discursive litterateur.
Ebenezer Syme, a profound
thinker and vigorous writer,
was cut off by death as soon
as he had established his
name. Then the chair
passed to G. P. Smith, a
splendid slang-whanger,
»hose style was founded
on that of Wm. Cob-
bett, of whom Hazlitt
quoted “he had the
back-handed trick bet-
ter than any man in all
Illyria. ” G. P. ’s article
on “ Men PootPes,”
aimed at Captain Stan-
dish and one or two
other Melb. Clu b cele-
brities, attracted so
much attention that it
was posted on card-
board and exhibited in
city shop windows.
James Harrison, who
followed, was a thor-
oughly sound and care-
ful man. The office
gossip always credited
him with having at
least a little to do with
the authorship of the
book on political econ-
omy which bears David
Syme’s name on its
tide-page. There was
not much in the way
of political intrigue
that was not' known
to Geo. Collins Levey,
his successor. A. L. Wind-
sor, who came next, and
reigned 25 years, was a well-
equipped, all-round literary man
who acquired his style from con-
stant study of the Saturday Review in its best
days, and who narrowly escaped being one of the
essayists of his century.
The curtain should now be definitely rung
down on the Baden-Powell farce, with the presen-
tation of that “sword of honor from Australia.”
“Australia,” in this instance, largely represented
the more-or-less unwilling victims who parted
pence in response to the cadging of various young
Evangeline Snookses with penny-collecting cards
—said little missies having had their collecting
industry stimulated by the hope of a public pat
on the back from the Sydney kitchen-gossip organ.
The death of Mrs. Charles Daniel O’Connell,
in England, brings out the fact that the Sydney
Rileys, of £5-bale of drapery fame, are related to
Irish Demosthenes Daniel O’Connell. The lady
just deceased was daughter of Edward Riley, and
her husband was related to Maurice O’Connell.
Old citizens remember the row between Alderman
Harris and Alderman Riley, when the former
charged the latter with saying, one time, he was
of Irish desoent, and later denying his Irish
extraction and claiming to be of an old English
family.
MOTHER'S CARE.
As exampled in sundry inquest and hospital cases of late.
The charge of indolence against Barton,
the Federal Constitution-maker, is, curiously
enough, a repetition of that urered by S.M.
Herald against Wentworth, the N.S.W. State
Constitution-maker, when, in July, 1843, he was
a candidate for the Speakership of the new Leg.
Council: “Of steady and sustained application
we believe him to be quite incapable, and if he be
called to the chair we are satisfied its duties will
be performed in a fitful, slovenly manner dis-
creditable to himself and prejudicial to the public
interest.”
It would not be surprising if N.S.W.
Attorney-General Wise appointed Mr. C. E.
Pilcher, Q.C., to the Chief Justiceship. Mr.
Pilcher probably makes, say, £6OOO or over
annually at the Bar, and his appointment would
mean a distribution of this money among other
wigged leaders, of whom (though this is a side-
issue) B. R. Wise would get the bulk. The
main consideration is that of all names mentioned
for the position Mr. Pilcher’s is the most popular
amongst the Bar men having claims as legatees to
that £6OOO.
“Baldy” Davis, from Bourke, told N.S.W.
Assembly that, during 18 yearn’ pioneering
in the Western Division, he paid £55,000 in
interest. A member interjected—“ You got into
the hands of the Jews.” “No, I didn’t,” said
Baldy. ‘‘ I got into the hands of a good, honest,
Scottish firm.” If Mr. Davis had taken his
troubles to Jewry in the first instance, the end
would have been more speedy in coming, but he
would have probably paid in the aggregate less
interest. These “good, honest, Scottish firms”
know their business.
Fifteen years ago, Thomas Hall, of Christ-
church (M.L.), was sentenced to life-long im-
prisonment for the attempted murder of his wife
by poison. Maoriland law isn’t liberal in the
matter of divorce, but it gives a woman the right
to her freedom if her husband is sentenced to a
term of over seven years for trying to take her
life, and Mrs. Hall appealed for and got her
divorce a few days ago. Away back in 1886
there were many affluent men who would have
gladly married the heroine of the great poisoning
case, but 1886 is long ago.
Mr. T. H. Nesbitt, Sydney’s new town
clerk, is, at any rate, no end of a fine Freemason,
being a member of Tynwald Lodge, No. 1242,
Douglas; W.M. of Spencer Walpole Lodge; a
Deputy Provincial Grand Master; a J.W. ; a
P.P. Senior Grand Warden ; a Royal Arch of A
Mole ; a First Principal; a Past Assistant Grand
Director of Ceremonies; a Mark Master; a
P.P.G.I.G. ; a Rose Croix; and a dozen or so
other things. The Bulletin trusts that some of
these weird honors argue a capacity for dealing
vigorously with street stinks.
King Dick of Seddoiiland has a son, until
a year ago a youth with an adolescent fringe on
his upper lip, the polisher of a stool in a Welling-
ton office. Young Dick had never been a volun-
teer. but his rotund Royal father thought he
would be a fit and proper subject to lead M.L.’s
bone and sinew against the Boer. Getting young
Dick’s commission was an easy matter, and
then “Bobs” begged H.M. Dick, as an especial
favor, for the loan of his gifted son as a staff-
offieer. Now Maoriland has upended itself in
frantic joy on the return of Captain Seddon, and
Dick swells his chest with joy and pride at
“my boy, my boy” as he calls the heavens to
witness that he, too, has given to the Hempire of
his own flesh and blood.
There is a little conspiracy hatching in
Van Dobson Land to confirm Alfred Dobson in
his billet as Agent-General in London at I*6oo a
year, and at the same time appoint a commercial
agent at a good salary to do the work that Alfred
is supposed to do, but doesn’t, because it would
be beneath the dignity of the office. Alfred will
be supposed to shave very carefully every day and
look as nice as possible for the £6OO per annum ;
while the other fellow bustles about and inquires
the price of butter and blue-gum sleepers. To ex-
pect a member of the Van Dobson family to move
round among hide and tallow stores, even for
£6OOO a year, would be preposterous. Anyhow,
the confirmation of any Agent-General in his
office, in view of the probable early abolition of
the States’ A.G.’s, as such, ought to be regarded
with much suspicion.
A. E. Morgans,
the new Premier
of Westralia,
whose Govern-
ment is already
going to pieces, is
a representative of
English capital,
and has held a
seat in Westralian
Assembly for
some years, main-
ly that he might
keep an eye on
the interests of
his absentee prin-
cipals. Except
that he is in favor
of absentees and
foreign capitalists,
his policy and
opinions are little
known, and his
political attitude
has been that of
the man at a dog-
light who sits on
the fence to watch
the referee on be-
half of his friend’s
dog. Morgans
would probably
like to hand over
the Westralian
railways to English companies, from whom some
of them have only recently been rescued with
great difficulty and at considerable expense.
Miss Rose Scott, Sydney’s Woman
Suffrage leader, recently visited and inspected a
large N.S.W. country gaol, a special departmental
permit having to be obtained to overcome the
regulation against women visiting the men’s
quarters. The prison choir was specially told off
to sing “Te Deums” and the musical “I’m
Saveds ” of Sankey. This delightful official
subtlety was a huge success. The impressionable
lady willingly succumbed to the idea that prison
is a paradise, and stated, in big handwriting, “ I
am much comforted by all I’ve seen.”
Charles Sublet, a hearty old citizen of
Rochester (Vic.), has reason to remember the
eventful dawn of Sunday, Dec. 4, ’54, for he was
on sentry duty, with two others, at the corner of
the Eureka Stockade which was first attacked by
the Imperial troops. One of his companions was
shot dead at the first fire, and Capt. Vignol, who
led the attack, fell, shot in the thigh. The Stock-
ade defences consisted of two parallel logs,
against which slabs were fixed in upright position.
Sublet and his other mate found themselves undlr
the slabs, at the point of attack (for the logs
rolled over with the impetus of the stormers), and
escaped to their tents.
“ Cecil P.” to The Bulletin
Octogenarian R. A. Henderson, original discoverer of
lode tin in N.S.W., is still at Gulf Creek (Emmaville) tin-
field in that Sta e. He came out as a soldier in the 11th
Foot, and formed one of the guard of honor at the open-
ing of the first Australian railway. Some time ago, the
N.S.W. Govt. —mainly owing to work by Opposition
leader Lee—gave him a pension, but since the old-age
scheme has been in force this has ceased. Now, if Govt,
was justified in first granting this, it would be only logical
to continue it—whatever else may accrue from general
legislation. The old chap, who has not entered a town
for nine years, rises at four and tramps, jlone, miles away
over the mountains—driven by the spirit of discovery.
He and his wife are thrifty, kindly, and universally re-
spected.
Those who bungled N.S.W. Superannua-
tion Fund may be indirectly charged with
accelerating the death of Superintendent Read.
He has died in harness at 72, but had he been
able to retire on pension, as he was entitled to do,
and visit the old land, as he desired, he might
have added several years to the score. He was 52
years in the police service, 45 in N.S.W. and six
in England. He was one of the 40 who arrived in
Sydney per ship Bangalore in 1855 to form the
nucleus of the present force. It was cruelty on
the part of the Government to keep him in har-
ness so long. His pension would have equalled
his salary, and by keeping him on £470 a year was
saved.
When Thomas Broughton, ex-Mayor,
ex-M.L.A., celebrated his 91st birthday—and for
the last 40 years he loved to celebrate these occa-
sions—he claimed to have had only one rival in
N.S.W. in the number of such public commemor-
ations. That was the late Chief-Ju stiee Stephen.
Other men have lived longer, and in some, way
celebrated birthday anniversaries from time to
time, but Broughton and Stephen made the occa-
sions practically public festivals. Broughton, the
oldest Sydney Mayor, dies at 92, just as Hughes,
the youngest Mayor, takes the Sydney chair at
the age of 39. Broughton’s birthday celebration
lasted into his marriage celebration, as the days
were to-day and to-morrow. His widow is 80.
Acland Oronliyatekha, charged with indecent
assault on a lady typewriter, at the Melb. office
of the Independent Order of Foresters, is said to
be a full-blooded Mohawk Indian. His father,
who is also the “ father ” .of the 1.0. F., was the
young student chosen—so the story goes—to
deliver an address to the Prince of Wales (now
Kifig), when he visited. Toronto University, long
ago. Having fired off his eloquent address in the
orthodox cap and gown, Oronhyatekha came for-
ward again, this time in the war-paint and
feathers of a Mohawk chieftain, and welcomed the
Prince in his native lingo, subsequently translating
the speech into English. The Prince —so the story
goes—was so impressed by the brainy redskin
that he “shouted” him a trip to England and
placed him at Oxford University under the guar-
dianship of equerry Acland. In due course the
original Oronhyatekha married a Mohawk lady of
royal lineage, and their first-born, the young man
now charged with amorous misconduct, was given
the name of Acland after the personage aforesaid.

The Bulletin, the other day, printed a
wondrous sample of N.S.W. journalese. But
North Queensland can beat even that. A citizen
there, accused by a contemporary reptile of having
borrowed two shillings, finds room in the other
Deal paper for the milder part of his feelings thus
(after ->eing, as will be noted, severely pared
down by the editor)^
I was vilified with shameless audacity; and that too,
Great Heaven ! while in articulo mortis ! Had the paper
i« question only suspected that my life would he spared,
diend alone dread of the just chastisement which a
superior journalist was sure to inflict—would have saved
my character and reputation from its reckless, murderous
and unwarrantable onslaught. I make no apology, there-
fore, Mr. Editor, for tying this vile, villainous, and vindic-
rive paper up to the triangles of public opinion, and
publicly inflicting on it that figurative flogging, which its
sa\ agery and brutism have so richly merited. I rejoice
excei < ingly in my superior strength and superior intel-
lectuality ; and publicly challenge this literary assassin—
this journalistic vixen—to meet me in the columns of this
journal, and endeavour to defend itself from the odious
stai n of having tried to libel and ruin its neighbor in the dark
The paper is a liar and a slanderer, lacking only courage
to he an assassin. [More violent abuse here deleted.]
The action of the paper is in perfect harmony with its
every action since it commenced its miserable and ill-
fated career. [Some scathing expressions suppressed.] An
odious organ which is a vile satire on every other journal
in Australia. I detest its slimy ways, its meanness, its
unscrupulousness, its odious, glaring artificiality. This
wretched little paper [more virulent language cut out] is
as false as it is feeble, as cowardly as it is hypercritical, as
audacious.and vulgarly presumptuous as it is servile and
cringing.
X now arraigp this loathsome journalistic organism,'
this literary microbe, before the bar of public opinion :
and I do so in the interests of public peace and honest
journalism ; in the name of everything that is pure and
noble and holy ; everything that is bright and beautiful
and good ; in the name of that high heaven that bends
above us—that God we each adore. Finally, in the name
and in the interests of humanity, and in the broad, sacred
interests of liberty and truth.
But the North must be getting civilised, when
■editors plume themselves upon deleting all
“ violent abuse” from correspondent’s letters and
keeping them (as above) within the limits of
courteous debate.

There is a good deal more of the same sort, but the
job of investigation grows wearisome. Roughly
speaking, one can draw a line from' Barringun, on
the Q. border, due south to the Lachlan, and then
say in a broken voice that everywhere west of that
line and west of the Lachlan, save around the
Broken Hill mines, man is a diminishing quan-
tity. Also, in several counties east of the line
above described —in Culgoa, Narran, Cowper,
Gunderbooka, Canbelego, Mouramba, Kennedy,
Dowling, Sturt, Gaira, Waradgery, &c.—he is
also growing fewer and beautifully less. The
area of diminishing population, taken by counties,
amounts to about two-fifths of New South Wales.

“ Farrier ” : Be rat-exterminating crusade.
Rat is stealing along top-edge of lining-board in
butcher’s shop—is biffed, and falls ’twixt weather-
board and lining. Next morning board is removed
to recover the carcase, but the other rats have
‘ ‘ scoffed ” it, leaving only the hide. Now, are rats
habitual cannibals, or do they only “ get outside ”
their dead mates as a sanitary precaution, when
unable otherwise to remove the corpse ? It cer-
tainly wasn’t hunger that compelled them in this
case to “pass in” their “passed out” friend.

would break up the family, while to take them to

“ Bilby ” re Great West Land, N.S.W.
(B„ 23/11/’01): —
Can’t make out what “ P.X.” is driving at. A very few
lucky ones certainly made a pile in the early days by
selling out at boom-prices, before people knew what the
country really was, and when £5OO might have been
safely offered for any rabbit caught in the district, but
beyond this all is fair ruin ; and the financial companies
that tried to prop the thing up have all been hit very
hard. The fact that absurd prices were paid for many
stations has not made much difference ,in the long run.
The ruination would have come just the same if they had
got the country for nothing. The present trouble lies not
in the high price paid for the stations, but in the fact
that it is fast becoming impossible to carry any stock at
all. As for any western station-owner keeping up a
palatial city residence—why, his wretched drought and
rabbit-stricken desert of miles of cut scrub, sand-buried
fences, and dried-up tanks would drag him down to
poverty if he were a second Carnegie. Draw a straight
line from Brewarinna to Condobolin, and let the rest of
the map be bounded by the Lachlan and the Darling, and
I guarantee that for the last six years the genuine profits
from the whole of that vast extent of country would be
insufficient to run a mud hovel—to say nothing of a
palace !

An aged drover, found in a state of col-
lapse on Bungaree (Vic.) road by a constable, and
speedily taken to hospital, was so grieved over a
couple of old “ billies” the bobby left behind that
the latter seriously thought of going back for
them—till he searched the old chap’s clothing.
Then he changed his mind. In the clothes were
£62 in gold and a deposit-receipt for £llOO. The
ancient died a few hours later, the doctors said, of
absolute starvation. As he had no relatives and
died intestate, the Treasury gets a lift. Another

“H. J. M.” : Be
edible indigenous Aus-
tralian plants. About
two years ago a man,
whose horse threw
and deserted him in
the wild Queensland
South Coast district,
sustained life by eat-
ing fern pith until
found by a search-
party. The pith of
the cabbage-tree is a
good food, and may
be eaten raw —in
which state it tastes
almost like cocoa-
nut ; or boiled or
baked in the ashes, like
damper. The cabbage-like
portion is the part to use ; and
when boiled with corned beef
or bacon is not easy to distin-
guish from white-heart cab-
bage. Roasted under beef or
mutton it is still better, and
is a good substitute for arrow-
root or sago. The marsh-
mallow also makes a good
substitute for cabbage ; and
the buddawong nuts, when
crushed and soaked in run-
ning water for about 10
hours, may with safety be
boiled and eaten. They are very plentiful along
N.S.W. South Coast. The leaves of the pricldy-
pear also, when skinned and boiled, are accept-
able to a hungry or cabbage-sick man.

“ A.P.R.” : “ P.X.” (8., 23/11/01) admits
that the mortgage co.’s have turned out many
squatters in Western N.S.W. ; hut is he aware
that several of the co.’s themselves have nearly
gone “broke’ over western transactions? He
hints that the western settlers don’t deserve con-
sideration, because the de : reciation in land value
and the “ slump in wool ” “isn’t the State’s fault,”
and mentions that one squatter kept two servants,
and another had a fine house—which doesn’t
signify much if these men have involved a fortune
in the West. Would it be the “State’s fault ” if
half our province became a sandy desert, and if
the sturdy pioneers (not bloated-squatters) who are
sweating out the prime of their lives, hoping to
make a Hades habitable (for the good of the State’s
posterity), were allowed to abandon their pro-
perty —ruined? The voice of “P.X.” is that of
the pavement-tripper, not of the man who has
fought the heat, the drought, the rabbits, and the
maddening solitude of the West.

“H.P.” : i?ethe “Neglected Aborigines ” :
Ernest Favenc (8., 12/10/’01) makes a splendid sugges-
tion. And the areas reserved for the blacks would (or
should) be kept for ever- whether the native occupier
died out or nob. Then we would have National Parks —
Yellowstones of Australia. If only as a means of pro-
mulgating that idea, Favenc’s proposal should he kept
before the public. The present “ mission-station ” busi-
ness needs looking into, anyhow. For it seemingly is a
business.
THE LANGUAGE OF THE BUSH.
“ Give us a virtuous lubra !”
“A what?”
“A square gin, phase.”
The now Western Land Board (N.S. W.)
will have to give an early decision covering the
rabbit question. Squatters and selectors are ex-
pected to keep their runs and leases clear of the
post, yet of what use is their trying to do so
while the vermin are allowed to run riot over
travelling-stock routes and Crown lands ? One
Far West homestead lessee complains that,
though for a month recently he poisoned hundreds
of rabbits nightly, they still swarmed in on him
from adjacent Crown lands.

At Kilinore (Vic.), was recently fined a
farmer who for years has struggled his hardest
against therabbit pest, but who could, nevertheless,
be punished under the Vermin Destruction Act
for not performing an impossibility. Defendant
said that the struggle with the pest had cost him
two-thirds of his income, and that it was beyond
human power to cope with the rabbits, which, he
added, would be there as thick as ever long after
the Be.,ch and himself were mouldering in their
graves. The Argus correspondent reported the
ease as being a “ very amusing one.” Amusing !

Be that long-promised N.S.W. Inspection
of Land-Boilers Bill, which seems as far off as ever,
writes “W.H.T.”: —
In the bush there'still exists a goodly number of old
fire-kettles—many of them actually held together with
fencing-wire. A son of mine, 1 found, was employed
driving one of these, and, in answer to my anxious in-
quiries as to his safety, lie said : “ Oh, the old tank is all
right. When I get a full head of steam on, she leaks all
over; I have counted 16 such safety-valves. The worst
of it is, when she gets hot, the wire round her expands,
and you might as well have nothing to hold her in.” Of
course, the young chap is not a qualified engine-driver—
a man who knew anything of the potentialities of a term
would not have been found in the same paddock with
such a murder-machine. And this matter of unqualified
“ driving” also urgently needs legislative attention.
South Australia’s Land Boilers Bill, which lias
hung fire for over 20 years, has just been thrown
out. Until a bishop is blown up, or a judge badly
scalded, the decayed boiler will apparently remain
a neglected danger and a dreary joke for small
wits.

“Emquad” : I knew an old couple in
New England who owned a most remarkable
cockatoo. He could do anything but work. If
you pointed a gun at him he would stretch out his
wings and yell “Murder!” He was a perfect
imp of mischief, and nothing was safe that he set
his eyes on. He would follow the boss about
when he was transplanting cabbages, and pull
them out as fast as the old man planted them,
and when discovered would fly to the missus to
escape sudden death. He wasn’t ungrateful
either, for when said missus died, cocky refused
food, and simply starved himself to death.

“ C.H.R.” writes from a
great distance : Re kitten-drowning.
“ H.L.” (11/5/01) asks, “Is this ex-
perience unique ? ” No, it isn t at
all. It is a miserable cruelty prao-
tised on dumb animals, especially
cats, by ignorant, unfeeling, hog-
like persons with no brains in par-
ticular, It would be as unreason
able to take a useless horse out in
a boat and drown him, when by
one bullet from a rifle his troubles
would be o’er. Generally the
latter course is pursued, presum-
ably because it would be too much
trouble to drag a moke perhaps a
mile or two to a waterhole. A
blow on the head of cat, dog, or
other animal, when a gun is not
handy, is sufficient, when carefully
administered, to cause death, or,
at all events, insensibility at the
first attempt. Cats have been
known to survive under water ten
minutes, and any person who
would unnecessarily prolong a
dumb animal’s agonies for that
period deserves to be kicked from
Carpentaria to the Bight. There
is nothing unique about “ H.L.’s ”
experience, or about “H.L.” him-
.self. He is simply a person wlio
deserves hanging.

“Cosmos ”: Some Bundaberg (Q.) planters
subsidise a tame parson, who is handy for showing
visitors around and explaining how happy the

very “churchy” mill. He waxed eloquent at
prayer-meeting and was promoted. Preached, and
got a further rise. Preached some more, and got a
fancy cuff-and-collar billet. 'Then he had to let go,
and went on a glorious burst. Said that he found
works without prayer of no avail, and so had to
join the mob ; and his rather public explanation
affected the local holiness-market for some little
time. Reminds me that I once worked for a
religious dairyman near Auckland (stronghold of
sweaterdom, bethelism, and juvenile viciousness).
Dirty yard ; dirtier quarters ; hours, starlight to

“Alma”: To say that stones drop more

that more fruit drops from trees in autumn than
in spring, because there is more to drop ; or it may
be asserting that sun and earth, pulling together,
pull harder than when pulling separately ; or it
may be asserting that inorganio things have a
rhythm of life, like organic things;—ora dozen
other assertions.] Looking back over perhaps 100
serious accidents here (Broken Hill) during the past
half-dozen years, through falls of earth, most, by a
long way, ocourred during the day ; while the
other class of accidents, such as falling down
chutes, or through the careless use of explosives,
or getting caught in machinery, nearly all occurred
during the night-shift, when men cannot be so fit
to work, and a second’s lapse of memory may mean

“ Carisbrook ” : In championing the late
J J. Durack, “Spinifex” (8., 13/4/’01) suggests
to me that he is probably a personal connection of
some of the owners of “ indentured ” slaves. I
was myself acquainted with the late Durack, but
as he is “ the late,” I prefer to say nothing about
his treatment of the natives. The contention that
the nigger has a grudge against all white men
because “white man take my country” is pure
bunkum, to be swallowed only by those who
liave not been behind the scenes. I spent years
in the Nor’-West, and I know what I’m talking
about. Can “ Spinifex ” supply a single instance
of a “white fellow” having been strung-up (in
that part of A ustralia) for the murder of a black —
as against the dozens of cases in which niggers
liave been hanged for offences against whites?

“ E.O’D.” : A belated “tight place”
item. Self, mate and a few wage-hands were
fencing in the Yic. Mallee. Mate’s young wife

After one roasting day, when approaching camp
in the evening, we missed the usual smoke; also
the cook. The first man to approach the tank for
the wherewithal to ablute hastily retired with
blushes and blasphemy, and investigation dis-
closed the lady imprisoned in our reservoir. De-
siring a bath, she had got in per opening on top.
Her body swelled a little by contact with the
water, and she couldn’t get out until she cooled
and shrank after nightfall. Sceptic can test
truth of this by immersing his maiden aunt in
water for a few minutes on a hot day and
observing how she expands.
“Trapper” : “G.J.M.” (B. 26/10/’01) is
absurdly wrong in asserting that “only flesh- ,
eating animals lap their fluid,” and that “vege-

garoo does.” It is beyond all

Re the inefficiency of the blockhouse-sys-
tem in S’Africa. The Times urges “ that block-
houses should be placed not more than 400yds.
apart, and that they should be connected by wire
entanglements.” Good old Times ! That would
mean more than four times as many blockhouses,
four times as many men locked up in them, and
four times the expense. Does the Times know
what it means to live for months in a blockhouse
—to be shut up week after week with 15 or 20
others in what is really only a big box, with no
light but what comes through narrow loopholes;
unwilling to open the door for fear of bullets ;
no fresh air, no exercise ? That sort of thing
merely fits men for a lunatic-asylum. The
Times wants more C.l.Y’s. and more Australian
contingents. Well, the Australian who wants to
go to S’Africa to be shut up in a blockhouse is
welcome to it, provided the British Govt, will
supply the asylum he will have to be sent to when
it has done with him.

loan expenditure, to close on £1,000,000 a year. But it
was mostly military expenditure ; Britain’s is mostly
naval. Your Ovens and Murray Advertiser genius deals
with naval expenditure only, and thereby howls under
false pretences Adelaide: You admit that municipal
tram ownership is better than the Snow monopoly idea ;
so, despite your curses, you are on the same side as Tiie
Bulletin. The fact that you can’t get municipal owner-
ship while Adelaide is run by 8 or 10 corporations only
shows, as The Bulletin always said, that the municipal

O.P. : “Argument was unnecessary after he had
gripped his audience.” Just so! The feebler the
listener’s intellect the more “ grip” of him gets the man
of phrases. “ Oratory,” in short, sways most opinions
that are worth least Durban : Chiefly fearsome shriek,
punctuated with a shrewd knock or two. Hit more and
howl less.... Sally W. : Alas! Sarah—you don’t know-
how to begin to write Mount Morgan : Not much in-
formation in your letter.. ..G. Cob.: Some “rings”

Portland Cement .. .. .. 8,000,000

These and 26 other trusts are all of recent origin. Out
of the whole 36, no less than 27 arose in 1898, 1899, and
1900. Figures are mostly up to 1900. Duringl9ol many new
combinations have been formed and old ones enlarged....
W.T. : By British law the reigning monarch is legal guar-
dian, not only of his children but of his grand-children.
Royal marriages and other family arrangements are
regulated by no rules of sentiment, delicacy, or even
decency ; it is always just a question of keeping the suc-
cession safe Mill Manager : What is the process of
“manipulation” you allude to? How is the swindle
worked? James Car. : Supposing that the verdict in
the case of the 13-year-old boy Gravenlock ivas an
illogical one, in face of the evidence adduced, who or
w r hat is to blame ! Simply the reputation of Judge
Docker, whose notorious eccentricities made the jury
decline to trust him with a verdict which would enable
him to exercise to the full the powers of punishment
accorded by the law in cases of this kind O. M'Kaye :
But then, as a weapon to protect a couple of men in charge

poor weapon compared with a breech-loading gun

TO THE EDITOR OF THE AGE.
Kir.—ln 'the report that appeared in your
columns of the recent conflict that has been going
on in the bosom of the Victorian Artists’ Society,
and of the final resolutions of the council, that
body, composed of the principal artists in Mel-
bourne, lias been accused of “aiming at crushing
all aspirants in art,” and reminded that “ its
primary object was the encouragement of national
art.” Now, it isnot the “'pirants to are., but, to 1
speak plainly, the apes of art that

that if the spirit of gambling wastobe checked
the work would have to be done at the.

• Bill was framed with a good purpose,'but he

expected. It was hopeless to try to cute «o®,

Is not civilisation a defiance of natural ten-
dencies? Put a man alone, say, on an island, supplying
him with all the accessories of modern civilisation, and
would he continue the usages of polite society, or would
he revert, in the long run, to savagery ? “ Fingers were
made before forks.” Would the man, for instance, take
to eating his meals with Nature’s utensils, instead of con-
tinuing the use of those provided by Custom? If anyone
with a craving for research would care to make the ex-
periment and will provide the island, we, for our part,
will provide the following: Ivorine Table Knives, at 12s. ;

Miss Susie Vaughan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miss Vaughan said:—“l believe that ‘Lady
Hunt worth’s Experiment ’ will be the plum of the
Broughs’ programme. Carton, the author, is a
tiny little chap, and his wife a fine, tall woman.
She is Miss Catherine Compton, the actress. The
parts in ‘Lady Hunt worth,’ and ‘Lord and Lady
Algy ’ and ‘ Wheels within Wheels ’ were written
specially for her by her talented husband. She’s
the pivot on which the play turns, and she speaks
those quiet, telling lines with effect. She
doesn’t assist Carton in his play-writing. She
leaves it all to him. Carton writes beautifully. I
love his plays. He brings everything home and
makes it sweet and wholesome. I don’t like the
problem-play. It leaves a disagreeable taste in
the mouth. I love Carton. He is more human.
“Your paper calls me ‘the fat woman,’ but I
don’t care. I cut the notice out and pasted it in
my scrap-book. I have a quiet-looking face, al-
though you wouldn’t think it; and when they
photo, me they have to snap me. If they keep
me too long with ‘ Keep smiling like that' That’s
nice ! ’ my photo, comes out with my teeth
smiling, but my eyes looking serious. So I very
seldom have a photo, taken. I don’t mind the
dressmaker, but I hate the photographer.
I love character business ; and I’m very fond
of my work—if I’m out of it I’m miserable. But
I never go to witness a performance ; never go to
a matinee. And I’ve never spoken a line of
onakespeare
in all my 30
years of stage
life. In Eng-
land we are
always en-
gaged in the
same Hue of
business, al-
though there
may b* other
parts that you
are dying to
play. Thus,
for the past lf>
years, I have
always played
old women,
with not more
than three
breaks. An-1,
after all, it
doesn’t mat-
ter to me. It
brings the
money in, and
I’ve got on
s plendidly.
Miss Prim, of
‘Nita’s First,’
was the be-
ginning of my
playing old
women. My
favorite part
is Lady Janet
M‘Clin took in
‘ The White
Heather.’ I
just love it.
It’s a magnificent part; the sort of part you only
fet once in your life. My part here in ‘ Lady
[untworth’s Experiment ’ is the same as I had
in the London production. I love breezv, bright
comedy.
“Do I smoke ? Ido ! I sit on the balcony and
smoke in the evening. It soothes me. If I were
a man I’d love my pipe. If I have a worry on the
mind I take to the cigarette.
“Diet ? Eat anything you want or fancy. I’m
so healthy I can eat anything, and I do. If nature
craves for sweets, I say take sweets. I eat any-
thing and everytliing.
“I never study my parts. I learn my words.
I never think how I shall pose or act. But I’m
not Miss Vaughan on the stage. I lose myself in
the character. That is the only way to act pro
perly. The moment you become self-conscious on
the stage, you’re done. If you begin to think of
your hands—forget you have them. Do the same
by your feet. Otherwise you’ll feel you have fifty.
It’s very difficult to be natural on (' e stage. The
art of concealing art is the great dnriculty of our
profession- I suppose one of the hardest parts is
that of Juliet, where the woman must look young
and yet mjust be thoroughly experienced.
“I believe in exercise. I don’t go in for it
myself, biit I know it’s very good. I believe in
dumb-bells for people who haven’t weak hearts,
f used to vow ; I love it. I love the water; but I
had to. give rowing up because I was getting so
broad in the back. I get on the roof here some-
Jjmes and look out upon the harbour. I do so
longfo get on the water and have a row—l want
to stretch my muscles. By the way, your paper
called me a fat woman. I’d rather be a fat woman
kj ,all ,a scrag. But I’m going to take it off.
W allung ? As a girl I never used to walk much,
although I was a dancer. My feet are fearfully
tender if I walk, although I’ve been treading on
them a good while now.
“ London audiences are very sympathetic and
never laugh at a love-scene. I cannot understand
why Australian audiences laugh at the pathetic in
a love-scene. They certainly don’t know how
heartbreaking it is to artists. It makes me feel
angry enough to throw myself at them, and I
should hurt them if I did.
“Charles Wyndham is the best actor on the
English stage. We have no best actress. We
haven’t one really good actress on the English
there’ll be no actors in England soon,
ihe days of the stock season, which gave actors a
round of characters to play, are over, and an actor
who wants the perfection that comes from real
hard work and varying experience would obtain a
better training with Robert Brough and his com-
pany than he could get in any other school I know
of. But the continual change of programme is
very hard on Mr. and Mrs. Brough, who play the
leading parts—parts that are very long. Brough
mounts the plays here equal to London pro-
duction.
“ I’ve had no holiday from rehearsal yet—when
T do get a week, I’m going to do everything.
During my stay, so far, in Sydney, I’ve never
seen anything but King-st. and William-st. And
now our season here is coming to a close, and,
womanlike, I leave everything to the last minute.
“I never knew what nervousness was until the
last 10 years ; and, even now, I don’t get really
nervous. When I’m waiting at the wings, I get a
little shaky—a little flutter —tjien I hear my cue,
and it’s all over. I didn’t begin my stage-life with
acting ; I began it with dancing. And that is why
I believe I don’t get nervous. With some act-
resses, the nervousness clings to them all their
lives. It fairly gets hold of them, and worries
them in their dressing-rooms, and when they come
out, and stand waiting to go on, they become
actually sick with nervousness—l’ve often seen
my sister, Kate, actually sick on one side of the
stage, and Kellie Barren actually siok on the
other, as they waited for their oues. Nellie
Farren was nearly always ill like that imme-
diately before going on.
“Bernhardt draws in London, but, as a rule,
foreign artists, speaking a foreign language, do
not draw for any length of time. People go to see
them a little while because it is fashionable. But
you will see five men sleeping in one row of the
dress-circle at a foreign entertainment, and when
the curtain falls you will see their five wives nudge
them hard in the ribs, and then the five men wake
up, and applaud. The foreign artist gets more
sincere sympathy from the gods, and that is why
he sings to them —OUT! goes the note, and—
UP ! goes the hand.
“I knew Miss Ida Yeoland, poor girl. It
knocked me over when Mrs. Brough told me
about the two sisters’suicide. Ida was a sweetly
pretty girl and cheery ! —she used to call me Aunt
Susie. She used to say to me, * I don’t know what
I’ll do when you’re gone. Auntie —you buck me up
so.’ She was a very promising girl, too. She
played the parts very well that I saw her in.
“ The profession in London is so overcrowded.
I don’t know how half or quarter of the girls live.
The London managers are to blame, I think, for
the overcrowding. A girl comes along, who is
pretty and filled with anfbition for the stage, and
they tell her, ‘ Yes, we can let you walk on to
begin with, and then you must wait your oppor-
tunity.’ And that’s as far as the girls get. Girls
are more open to temptation on the stage than in
ordinary life; though, of course, that sort of thing
is purely a matter of temperament. If a girl is
inclined that way she will go wrong in a

church—or a coffee-palace. At the same time,
people who condemn girls who go wrong on the
stage, are very seldom in the position to under-
stand how great the girls’ temptations are.
There is much truth in the lines
Fate or force of circumstance
Moulds us all to saints or sinners.
But actors and actresses now occupy a social posi-
tion that was never allowed them previously.
They were called rogues and vagabonds in the old
days, and I suppose they were not far from it.
But now they are sought after and run after by
the best and strictest society. And the extent to
which they are courted is illustrated by the case
of Mary Moore, of Wyndham’s Theatre. A
society lady fell so much in love with her, that
when the lady died she bequeathed sufficient pro-
perty to Miss Moore to make her independent of
her profession, if she chose, all her life.
“Yes, I’m married; I have one son and one
daughter—a pigeon pair.”
S. A. MILLS.
Allerdale Grainger, the newly-appointed
State Agent in London for S.A., moved by some
muddle-headed comment on the Islands Labor
Bill, published by the Daily Graphic, wrote a
short and pointed letter describing Kanaka
labor conditions as “little better than slavery.’
This evoked a long-winded remonstrance from
dreary Q. Agent-General Tozer, and the contro-
versy is the first open discussion in the camp of
the Australian representatives in London.
Curious advt. in a recent S.M. Herald :
~\XT ANTED, EMPLOYMENT as Caretaker, place of
' r trust, by one for 40 years in N.S.W., used carp,
tools for living'; father was first surveyor employed
by Sir T. Mitchell ; mother, with her parents came to
Sydney, 1813, by Rev. S. Marsden, for mission work
in Maoriland ; her father was sent as forerunner by
Gov. Macquarie, March, 1814, with the Mission Brig
Active to Kororareka Bay to clear the way for three
families, who landed from the Active with Mr.
Marsden on the following Christmas Day.
Active, Herald Office.
The legend is an interesting one. Were The
Bulletin a “first-family,” it would get advertiser
a job—if only to keep a valuable historian within
the family circle.

Home and household doomed or wrecked,
Will not own himself defeated,
Nor forego his self-respect.
May we hope this latest message
From a monarch on the raek
Thrilling with most mournful presage
Will avail to win him back ?
Though a continent hath travailed
In a strife by gold-bugs bred^
Will the knot remain unravelled
When the King’s own word is said ?

Dance with death to horror’s tune,
Will he mar the Coronation
By resisting up to June ?
Burglars and Bottles.
Thb man who has once driven a burglar out of his
house with a pistol is likely to keep the weapon
handy by for use in the future.
On a similar principle Mrs. Elizabeth Langmaid
is never without a bottle of Mother Seigel’s Syrup
where she can lay hands on it any day.
About four years ago she was taken bad with
what was called “ a complication of complaints.’’
The doctors said she had an abscess on one of her
lungs, and also indigestion and heart troubles.
And, seeing how she looked and felt, we should
have believed him without a moment’s hesitation.
“You can get an idea,” she says, “how bad I
was when I tell you I lay helpless in bed nearly
nine months.
(That does give us the idea and no mistake.
Save for the hope of recovery—which seldom
3uite perishes in the mind—l would as lief be
ead, and so have the trouble over and done with).
“Finally,” Mrs. Langmaid goes on to say,
“when I got out of bed, all of me that could
waste away was gone. I was just a skeleton
covered by a skin. In truth thoy wrapped me in
wadding—for appearance and for such comfort
and warmth as the protection might give me.
“ Whatever my complaint was I always had a
dreadful pain in my sides and under the shoulder-
blades; but the medicines I took had no more
effect on it than so much sweetened water would
have had.
“ While in this miserable condition I remem-
bered how different friends of mine had spoken of
the virtues of Seigel’s Sprup for many kinds of
ailments that nothing else seemed able to help.
“Anyway I was sure it would be no mistake to
try it,, and. so I got a bottle from Campbell & Co.’s
store in this town. Up to that time I always had
a great feeling of weariness and drowsiness after
eating, and could not shake it off.
“ But, to my delight, I soon discovered that a
dose of the Syrup dispelled this almost imme-
diately, and by the time I had finished the first
bottle I was greatly improved.
“ As you would suppose, I persevered in taking
the remedy until, by degrees, I got strong again.
Gradually, too, I picked up my lost flesh, and
recovered my former good health.
“Ever since then I keep a bottle of Seigel’s
Syrup in the house, and take a dose whenever I
feel out of sorts in any way.
“You may publish this if you like, and I shall
always be glad to hear of Seigel’s Syrup doing for
others what it did forme.”—Elizabeth Langmaid,
Market-street, Muswellbrook, N.S.W., Sept.
26th, 1899.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Home Rule for N.S.W. !” That is to
say, Local Government.
The Govt, proposal that well-to-do rela-
tives of N.S.W. old-age pensioners be compelled
to reimburse the State suggests that the old-age
pension is a charity and not a right; and so
destroys the cardinal principle of the scheme.
Every man who votes for the Bill in N.S.W.
Assembly is an enemy to old-age pension.
Westralia’s new and temporary Premier,
Morgans, has put up something like a record. He
formed a Ministry of six, including himself, and
three of them immediately lost their seats when
they went to their constituents for re-election.
It is but a few months since these same men
werer returned at the general election, so it was
probably being found in Morgans’ company that
killed them.
N.S.W. Assembly, last week, had a sitting
of 30 hours at a stretch. Fourteen hours were de-
voted. to additional estimates (revenue account) of
a few thousand pounds. Then nearly £3,000,000
of loan estimates went through in less than half
the time, and the House turned again to additions
to the additional estimates (revenue account). It
looks as if Parliament didn’t care a rap how loan
monfiy is spent.
W.A. Worker reprints a year-old speech
of the new Westralian Premier Morgans (delivered
in London):
The position I took up upon it was this, that I acted as
the mouthpiece of the Chamber of Mines in the House.
When I tell you, Mr. Chairman, that I brought forward
on that Bill 27 amendments, only three of which I was
able to carry, I think it will be quite easy for gentlemen
in London to realise that at least I did my best to carry
out the wishes of the Chamber of Mines, and also the
wishes of the London capitalists with regard to this Bill.
The only private member in the House who has ever stood
up and defended the rights of the London capitalists is
myself!
THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE.
REV. MR. STUFFENKIDD (who rather fancies himself
in making Scripture lessons entertaining to the
children): “Now, boys, what would you have
done if you had been in Balaam’s place when
the ass spake? ”
SMALL BOR (on front seat): “ Sold him, to the circus!”
(Here you might have heard an elephant drop.)
The indignant consternation with which
Sydney D.T. greets the discovery that the Federal
Labor party knows a thing or two in practical
politics is very amusing. That paper confidently
relied upon the Labor Senators to create trouble
in the Senate over the Aliens Immigration
Restriction Bill, but they wouldn’t. With an eye
on the safety-of the Kanaka Bill, they determined
to take what they could get instead of demanding
the impossible. What angers the D.T. particu-
larly is the artful way in which the Labor Sena-
tors “saved their face” by throwing the responsi-
bility of negativing the absolute exclusion clausa
on the Freetraders. What is “ splendid tactics ”
in Reid or M'Millan is, from a D.T. point of
view, “disreputable manoeuvring” in a Labor
member
They had a financial debate in N.S.W.
Assembly last week on a Bill brought down by
the Treasurer to repudiate a deficit-repayment
agreement, on the ground that N.S.W., despite
the increased tariff revenue, couldn’t spare the
money. Extracts from various financial experts
who spoke
The Howling Dervishes of the Opposition. . . It would
be a hard job to batter your brains out. . . You are
nastiness itself. . . Bananas ! . . I wish, Mr. Speaker,
you would keep this king of the cannibal islands in order.
. . . You’re the wild man from Borneo ! . . . Order. . .
laughter . . . yells . . . order ... I withdraw . . .
order. . . It is absolutely false . . . order . . . loud
laughter.
After these and similar cogent arguments the bill
passed its second reading by 65 to 31.
N.S. Wales M’s.P., whatever they may
say, are solidly opposed to any reduction in their
numbers, and Premier See (who hasn’t yet got his
title) bows his head. The question is to be sub-
mitted in some form or other at the general elec-
tion a couple of years ahead, but as all sides were
agreed at the last contest on the desirableness of
instant reduction, the Government’s course is a
most cheeky one.
Alleged by one politician that, owing to
the inability of the O’Sullivan to say “No” to
any request for a railway, there exists a private
compact between N.S.W. Govt, and its Upper
House supporters to reject any Bill that doesn’t
really meet with the Ministerial approval. The
M’sL.C. can view the storm calmly from a safe
spot, whilst O’Sullivan and co. pose as martyrs
of Upper House obstruction.
Printed again by a London paper that—
The sensation of the next British general election will
be the adoption as part of the Govt, programme of a
scheme of modified Protection—the long-talked-of
Imperial Customs Union, which will be formulated by
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.
Seriously, can Prime Minister Barton be well
spared next year to attend that Coronation, and a
little private conference with screwmaker Judas?
“ I wish my own dogs would not bite me ! ”
was the retort of Labor-member Carpenter, in
S.A. Assembly, when a colleague interjected
during his speech. The Party is very angry
now at being spoken of as “ Carpenter’s dogs, ”
and he has had to suffer much criticism in con-
sequence. He is the tub-thumper of whom
Premier Jenkins remarked: “The hon. member
is too suspicious to be politically honest, and too
pious to be good. ”
The foreign importers’ party has two
deafening dog-howls in its mouth just now. One
is that the Kingston tariff is “prohibitory ” —will
stop all imports—and will therefore produce no
revenue; consequently, it should be lowered, as
lower duties, by not checking imports, will yield
more revenue. The other is that Kingston’s tariff
promises to yield £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 a
year, which .is an absurd sum to take from the
people; consequently it should be reduced so as
to yield less revenue.
William M‘Millan on the tariff: “ N.S.
Wales stands to-day with a clothing industry on
the soundest possible footing without the assist-

Treasurer Waddell’s new Audit legislation
is expected to terminate Auditor-General Rennie’s
connection with N.S.W. official life.
Mr. Rennie’s innings was long.
He came of a scholastic
stock, and took
naturally to a se-
dentary and re-
tired life. He
was clerk in the
Audit Office be-
fore Constitu-
tional Govt, was
granted, and has
been working
about there for
nearly 60 years.
He had some
stiff battles to
fight with Trea-
surers who took
irregular views of
financial obliga-
tions, and a few
years ago was
almost goaded out
of office. Were it
not for the terms of
the Audit Act, he
would have been com-
pelled to resign. Mr.
Rennie has always main-
tained his independence of
Treasurers, even when they
were Premiers. He is now well past
80, but his head is still clear, and he is ready
as ever to tell a Treasurer to keep his place.
Ketchener’s reply to criticisms of his con-
centration camps is a lovely bit of brutal cynicism.
Cabled—
The British columns now leave the Boer women and
children on their ruined farms, disregarding all appeals
to take them to the camps.
It was complained that, at the camps, an enormous
percentage of women and children died— i.e., were
killed by the system—so, in future, the helpless
are (after being deprived of the shelter of their
homes) to be left in a desolated land, where they
must almost certainly perish.
Brisbane Courier describes the “ White
Australia ” idea as a crime against Nature, which
will surely bring about its own punishment. Yes,
Serhaps ! But Nature didn’t put the Chinaman,
ap, Hindoo or,Kanaka here, and what right has
the Courier tojrnow more than Nature as to the
right place for these people ? And it didn’t put
the Courier here dither, or the white man, or the
British authority; and it didn’t- send the Briton
to rule India or Burmah or Egypt or South Africa.
Isn’t it a trifle late to begin growing anxious about
the intentions of Nature ?
The -most soulful plaint about the Tariff
which The Bulletin has yet met is the wail of a
Melbourne bookseller of intensely moral ten-
dencies that the unregenerate Ministry proposes
to exact 25 per cent, on imported scriptural texts,
Sunday-school cards, illuminated emblems an l
other such “ elevating ” goods. He reckons that
unless every home can get its imported motto :
“A soft answer tumeth away wrath,” “In life
we are in death,” at duty-free rates, the Common-
wealth will start on the high road to the imported
Pit where the imported Worm dieth not.
Premier Jenkins, of S.A., made no seri-
ous attempt to establish a State-owned electric-
tramway system in Adelaide. Nor did he make
any attempt to consolidate the eight or ten wild-
cat municipalities into a Greater Adelaide with
one municipal council, so that there would have
been a fair chance of establishing a municipal
system. But by setting apart a night for the
Snow Bill, and keeping a quorum together, he
was mainly responsible for putting the private
monopoly scheme through, and for tin's S.A." will
remember its Jenkins in days to come.
The two voices of Sydney D.T. on the
tariff:—
. Dec. 3 : “ The actual experience of the tariff for the
months of October and November indicates that it would,
if passed in its present form, yield a million and a half
more than the Govt, estimated for the current year, and
between two and three millions more than the estimate
for what Sir George Turner calls a normal year. These
are miscalculations worthy of the financial capacity of
this Ministry of lawyers.”
Dec. 14 (after changes which the D.T. generally de-
scribed as likely to bring in more revenue): “ There is
no possibility of the tariff yielding what had been ex-
pected from it.”
Mr. Arthur Griffith, M.P., hon. secretary
of N.S.W. Labor Party, writes :
I want to contradict your statement (14/12/’01) that the
N.S.W. Labor Party “ was disposed to agree to the Leg.
Council’s amendment in clause 36 of the Arbitration Bill
till Sydney Labor Council demanded them to make a
stand.” From the beginning that party was unanimous
in its determination to destroy the Bill rather than adopt
the amendment, and told the Govt. so.
And yet the statements to the contrary were so
numerous and so detailed. “ The party was
unanimous from the first.” Then what was all
the caucussing about ?
Griffith, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), accuses the See
Ministry of hiring four expensive barristers, at
£5OO a week, to represent it m the Rocks’ Resump-
tion cases. But this is, possibly, unavoidable ;
the way the barrister does things, it is necessary
to hire four of him to make reasonably sure of one
being there. A much more important matter is
this: When the awards are made, they will carry
interest from the date of resumption. Are the
rents which the Government has collected to be
used to pay that interest, or does the See Minis-
try propose to pay it out of loan moneys and use
the back rents as ordinary revenue ? If it does,
it deserves to be kicked out of office, and out of
the House, and into permanent oblivion.

Gr. H. Reid, in one of his moments of •
Nationalism :
While we talk of the necessity of founding these systems
of defence, let us never forget that war is a horror ; let us
never forget that, with all the glitter and glory of heroism
on the field, all these are black, dark chapters in the pro-
gress of humanity. Let our Australian spirit expand ■
itself, not in dreams of military adventure in other lands,
but in qualifying itself to put round continent,
a rampart of triple steel; that is a legitimate ambition
for a man or a country. Do not let the statesmen of
England think, because we are ready to send our men to
Africa, that Australians are infested with any lust of -
military enterprise. We are not prepared to enter ‘hose •
lists.
“ 0.0.” has an opinion :
Re the calamitous Western Lands Bill, I suggest
that “ Boss ’* Croker, of Tammany, be invited to
New South Wales to tender for the billet of
chairman of the Western Lands Commission. I am
certain, if he were given a copy of the monstroui
Bill, and the possibilities under it explained to him by
men “in the know,” the “ Boss” would see enougfi-tnoney
in it to plank down a few thou, per annum for all the
“ rights and privileges ” of the position. He might even
be induced to return 10 i>er cent, of the “ honor of tIm-
position ” to charities. What is the N.S.W. Farmers’ and •
Settlers’ Ass. going to do about it? The members have
a tremendous annual “pow-wow” and picnic, but when..;
are they going to do something?
Sydney Daily Tklkgraph prof esses amaze-
ment at the idea of the Senate agreeing to news-
paper postage without so much as a division. It
points out that as N.S.W., Tasmania, and S.A.
carry papers free, the question as to whether the-
other half of Australia is to impose postage on ,
the Commonwealth is a serious one. Yet the
D.T. sees nothing incongruous in demanding that
the Freetrade half (or less) of N.S.W. should be-
allowed to force its fiscal policy on the five Pro-
tectionist States ! The unanimity with which the
Senate welcomed newspaper postage is a facer to
the Sydney metropolitan press.
After a bout of all-night sittings the
N.S.W. Govt, succeeded in getting its Kstimates-
in-chief through the Assembly with the loss of'
about half-a-dozen items, aggregating some-
thing under £2000. When the Loan Esti-
mates came on, the Government calmly re-sub-
mitted the items which the House had booted out.
a few weeks before, and passed the lot without,
division. Reid, in his palmiest days, never had. 5
the House in such complete subjection as the See-
Criek-O’Sullivan combination. When the pen-
dulum swings back their downfall will probably
be more complete than his —and it must swing •
back some day.
In the division on Treasurer Waddell’s
Bill to drop the new annual vote —which has never •
yet been paid and only exists on paper —to diminish
the N.S.W. deficit from £250,000 to £100,000, and to .
postpone it for a year even at that, only .31 mem-
bers voted No. The great majority of these were
the old Freetrade party, which would just as.
emphatically have supported the motion had Reid
proposed it in his time, and who voted ag-ainst it
simply because the See Govt, party voted for it.
Of the Laborit.es, two only—Griffith and Holman
—opposed the act of repudiation, and of the-
Independent party, who hollered for Reform six
months ago, not one went against the Govt.
Sydney D.T., after sc.oling-on “ the young-
blood ” of N.S.W. Opposition to blither by the
hour in stonewalling the tariff, now savagely
turns on them thus : —
Mr. Sydney Smith, Mr. Conroy, and Mr. J. Cook, of’
N.S. Wales, contributed so much to the debates
the seven months that their “ A few remarks, Mr. Chair-
man,” represented'three and four.daya and nights’ talking-
without intermission. The whole of the ideas contained
in this avalanche of verbiage might be.-compressed into a ,
speech of a quarter of an hour. Mrs. Caudle was hardly-
as incessant or as aggravating.
Hard lines to be bitten by your own mongrel.
Poor Smith, poor Conroy, poor Cook! They
must feel like returned, unpaid cohentingenters.

“ &•" writes : Many readers will re-
member the Mulgrave Central Mill fiasco, near
Cairns (Q.), and the pro-aliens’ emphatio assertion
that this episode proved that the climate was too
hot for white men, consequently the employment
of colored labor was absolutely necessary—and so
read this quote from an account
x® Mossman Central Mill Co., whose estate is
further _ north than the Mulgrave. It will be
found in the November issue of the Mackay
buGAR J ournal, page 89, the official organ of the
Q. sugar-industry. After bemoaning the fact that
white laborers were migratory during the first
crushing at Mossman, the historian—who is the
paid secretary of the co.— remarks •
The migratory nature referred to may have been due
principally to the want of proper accommodation for the
staff and workmen (they lived in tents and in neighboring
v ’j ') until t . he crushi ng' season was well advanced.
Yet under the trying circumstances alluded to the man-
agement did not allow either Kanakas or Japanese to
work in the mill, nor have their services been called into
requisition at any time in the Mossman central mill.
Happily there has been no repetition of similar trouble,
the regular conduct and general efficiency of the mm
comparing very favorably with other centres of the
industry.
This proves what the “White Australia” party
has said all along—that white laborers’ reliability
is in proportion to the treatment they receive.

Perth, June 6,1900.
Dear Sir,—l have been invalided for about 2 years and
3 months. The doctors treated me for Inflammation of
the Lungs, Bronchitis, and Pneumonia, but failed to cure
me. I used to suffer with very severe pains through my
back and chest, and had a very nasty cough. I was in
the Perth Hospital three weeks, but the doctor told me
he could do no more for me, and that I was as well as he
could make me. I was laid aside for 12 weeks at
Fremantle. The landlady of the Club Hotel advised me
to try VITADATIO, which I have done, and after taking
four bottles lam now in splendid health. I will be
pleased to answer any inquiries that any sufferer may
require in the hope that my humble testimony may be
the means of leading others to health.
Yours respectfully,

“Rough-rider” on “Sydney shingle-
shorts ”:
Sydney is more cursed with these than any other city I
know of. A notable example accosted me, the other day,
as I was enjoying a pipe in one of our parks. He was
about 30 years old—usually they’re a lot more advanced
in years. After a long rigmarole about the inconsisten-
cies of the various churches, he handed me a printed
digest of his views. The document was headed “MI
CREDE.” “Oh!" I said, “you believe, then, in the
phonetic system of spelling ? ” My interlocutor looked
strangely puzzled. “ They are,” he answered, in husky:
tones, “the outway of much thought. Six weeks did
those 17 clauses you see take to draw up.” I nodded due
appreciation—“ That there Nieene affair couldn’t well have
taken more.” Looking at this six weeks’result, I read :
“Clause I. Those who see the Great ‘I Am’ insole’s
abode in pitt till End of all things are wrong.” Mildly, if
not reproachfully, I pointed to the errors in spelling. He
only said : “ I wanted a religion, and I sought it with the
Roman Catholics, what did I find ? Incomprehensibility,
Transubstantiation, and such rot .” Here I pulled
him up, for a policeman, possibly of the R.C.
faith, had his eye on us. and returned to the
“ Crede.” Beyond the funny spelling, I saw
little to reward me till clause XVII. gave me sudden
pause. “ Rats is not cats, neither is raysons figgs, still in
chayos there is safety.” “ Yes,” said the phonetic
apostle ; “ I thought that would a bit stagger you like.
My meanin’isthat them like things require incorporation
like in the general complexity of things. D’ye see what
I mean?” I said I did, and he went on: “I’m gettin’
people to assist financial like to havin’ these pamphlets
distributed. I sent one to Archbishop Smith.” “Did
you get an answer?” “No,” he returned, cheerfully.
Then all matter being determined on as bein’ in a state of
flux, and affairs, generally speakin’, commutin’ theirselves
into absorption of the negative, why then we has universal
domination of the unquenchable.” I rose and departed
in great haste. A few days after I re-encountered my
friend in the position of lift-man to a set of chambers.
Some day, when he is thinking out some additions to his
creed he will let that lift go, and an eminent solicitor or
two will be killed.

He was an Australian country blacksmith,
named, say Smith, and he invented and patented a grub-
ber better than any then in use. Now, in the capital of the
province was a Arm which also manufactured grubbers, and
when the partners got to hear of Smith (through failure
to get orders in his district), they laid their Scotch heads
together; and, when Scotchmen put their heads together,
somebody’s got to suffer by it. Just when Smith had got
his little factory in good swing, the firm invited him to visit
the city to see if they could come to a friendly arrangement.
He went gladly, hoping to have his patent brought out and
to get a good royalty. The firm cordially welcomed him,
and, after liquid refreshment, the elder partner said :
“We have come to the conclusion that we can make grub-
bers at about half the cost that you can, through having
better workmen and better machines. Now, supposing-
we give you £2 for every grubber we make of your pat-
tern, will you give us the right to do so, and agree not to
make any more yourself ? You can’t possibly make more
than that on them as it is, and, moreover, we will pro-
bably sell three times as many as you would sell. We
could easily make 10 to 15 machines a day if there is a
demand for them.” Smith willingly signed an agreement
so apparently favorable to himself, and went home to
wait for the royalties to come along. He is still waiting.
The city firm simply never made a single grubber of his
pattern—but they often drink his health in silence and
Johnywalker. , * *
Dear Bulletin. — Re law and liquorers. I once
killed a man with bad liquor quicker than electrocution
could do it. “My corpse” was the victim of competition.
People will have cheap drink, and as the law allows
poisonous stuff to be sold, merchants must sell, and
cellarmen (I'm one) will fake it up. With such success,
too, that the Govt. Analyst (at the inquest) described my
blend as “a cheap but wholesome liquor.” If spirit-of-
wine, seven months old, reduced, faked (mystery) and
sold as “ Fine Old Cognac” was “wholesome,” then the
verdict was correct. I have known a publican to put
into 10 gallons of the stuff that caused the funeral a
double handful of tobacco. The boss seized the stock ;it
was returned to the store ; and in checking the quanti-
ties I made the discovery. From spirit-of-wine I have
manufactured “ Fine Old Cognac,” “ Jamaica Rum,” and
“ Treble Refined Geneva Hollands.” And the firm sold
thousands of gals, of each. If you want half-measures
for this condition of things, I will supply them. But,
with much profanity, I say—away with half-measures. I
have myself used good liquor all my life ; and, speaking
from an altitude of 6ft. lin., and a solidity of 13st., I
appeal to the members of the Federal Govt, to take an
interest in the breed of men. I ask them to put their
feet in cleats and keep pulling until the Fed. Govt, con-
trols the Destiny of Liquor. A white-faced Australia,
supplied with good liquor, need fear no foe.— Lush
Artist.

Morrissey, Vic. Minister of Agriculture, seems
disposed to talk sense about the local tobacco-growing
industry, which is bemoaning the loss of its 3d. per lb.
export 'bonus. He wants to know why Govt, should
encourage the export of Yic. tobacco when its market
price at the other end of the world is much less than the
Melb. manufacturers pay for imported leaf. At present,
122 hogsheads of stripped leaf are “awaiting sale” in
London, a previous purchaser having refused to take any
more of it at 4Jd. per lb. And a bonus of 3d. per lb. was
paid to the shippers of this absurdly inferior article !

Charming bit of German-English from a circular
recently received by a Sydney resident from a Berlin
entomological dealer“ Moreover you will kindly
observe that I am also ready to buy against cash Butter-
flies and great Moths of your country, provided their
price and quality be convenient, and, if you have the
intention to sell Butterflies and great Moths against cash
payment, I request you to tell me the price of your
Butterflies and Moths per 1000 pieces—viz., in Reichs-
mark, Francs, Dollars, or Sterling. When the prices
offered by you are favorable I have no doubt that we
shall arrive to the most animated and agreeable connec-
tions.”

Of all Maoriland industries, bacon-curing will
be hardest hit by the Federal tariff. Within the last two
years hundreds of thousands sterling have been sunk in
expensive plants for hog-curing. The Australian market
was looked on as the big one, S’Africa having proved a
bad frost, and Seddon’s new pets, the Islanders, not
using much pickled pig. The tariff of 3d. a lb. will, of
course, kill the Commonwealth trade. Bacon, unfor-
tunately, is a product the price of which can’t be raised :
as soon as it moves up, people begin to replace it with
fresh meat. The duty should give an enormous fillip to
hog-raising in Australia. What a business could be done
by big capitalists understanding the game, who would
take up northern alluvial lands, cultivate maize, sweet
potatoes, pumpkins, etc., on a big scale,, and feed the
produce to pigs bred wholesale.

A civil servant whom sickness and other mis-

paid off a Sydney money-lender t’other day. Shylock

£5OO, with several guineas and two-guineas as fines for

In view of the expected glut in the N.S.W.
fruit-market, it has been suggested that fruit-growers
should resort to “pulping,” and thus convert into a
vendible article produce which would otherwise mean a
dead loss. “No other producing industry,” it is pointed
out, “ insists on selling the produce raw or not at all, and
no one but easy-going Eastralians would go on doing it
year after year.”

Re the assertion that N.S.W. jam-manufac-
turers largely use pumpkin and turnip in their wares, an
analysis of samples from different factories has shown
that such is not the case, though it was found that in
some instances apple had been used as a bulk-producer.
Instructions have now been issued that where there is an
admixture of apple the jam shall be so labelled.
* # * *
Na'ive statement in Sydney D.T. on behalf of
N.S.W. strawberry-growers : “ We shall never be able to
export them raw, except perhaps to Queensland after the
northern crop is done, but any surplus could be absorbed
for jam, being better material for strawberry jam than
any kind of tomatoes or pumpkins.”
* * * *
From a trade journal, which speaks with
authority:—“ Unfortunately most of our factories in
N.S.W. are undermanned and worked by beggarly-paid
hands, in consequence of which the work is rushed
through, resulting in mottled or improperly worked
butter, untidy boxes, short weight, &c., all of which
defects tend to depreciate our butter on the London
market.” It looks as if even the great natural industry
of butter-making hadn’t been exactly flourishing under
Freetrade in N.S.W.

Editor Bulletin.—The answer to “Fridel’s”
query (B. 12/10/’01) re pawnbrokers and grocers seems to
me simple enough. The pawnbroker doesn’t lend you
84s. and charge you 645. interest per annum. He lends
you 84s. on an article pledged as security, and generally
worth 3, 4 or 5 times 845., at (say) 5. 6d. a month or Is. 3d.
a week ; and, on failure to pay at most two or three weeks’
or one month’s interest, forfeits the security. He gener-
ally deducts the first instalment of the interest. By this
means he multiplies his apparent 80 per cent, by any-
thing from 12 to 500 according to circumstances. He
cannot make bad debts if he knows his business, whereas
the rn-ocer even if a smart business man, often does,
because he’has to give credit for a longer or short« time
which the pawnbroker never do e s.-FAR West.
pawnbrokers-there are some-don t charge the rates nor
carry on the tricks which Far West mentions.-Ed. a. j
“Reg N ” : Re “ J.O.’s” story (B. 19/10/’01) of
the bank-clerk who drew a valueless cheque on his own
bank. I knew a bank-teller who used ha^. 1 , t ; ua ' 1 j 5 [ h t ° ub .
this kind of financing ; but it was neccssar j H
licans who kept their accounts at his bank. He k
exactly when the different “bungs P al d’"“ s f °
them not oftener than once a week-and to one of these
he would go, have a drink, and cash hls °'
which would be held by the publican o" 1 ? 1 Jf 1 ® I r ® K T*
depositing day, perhaps a week ahead day
came the teller would simply pocket tlle che<l “ e '
raise in the same way the same amount of cash to ma
the credit-slip right and his books balance, and this
“floating” would go on and on indefinitely, until the
“ gee-gee ” won or the money he expected turned-up.
A Murray River resident, desiring money-help,
was sent the usual form by the company to whom he
applied. In answer to the question Is there any en-
cumbrance on the property at present ? he wrote . V es,
two sons and three daughters but all well gro
useful.” _ *

There’s going to be a big condensed-milk indus-
try in Australia shortly, and it behoves the authorities
to see from the start that the factories turn out a whole-
some article, with a 1 the cream in, and no salicylic aci(l,
or saccharine. Much of the condensed milk imported to
Australia is only fit to be fed to Boer babies in concen-
tration camps “ from motives of humanity. There is no
reason why Australia should not meet its own demand,
and also make a colossal export of condensed milk.

Sydney Tailors’ and Tailoresses 5 Unions should
issue a Union label to factories paying fair rates. This
would give sympathisers a chance to discriminate against
the sweater.
* • • •
Some few weeks ago, down South, four young
fellows found themselves stone-broke, so, having procured
a couple of tin-lined cases, a few yards of ditto piping,
etc., they hied them to the hack of a bush pub., and
there, in a gully, dug a hole and fixed up their fake then
went to town and informed the authorities that they
believed they had discovered a “ still.” The police were
sent out and watched the place for a week, finally carting
the gear into the Custom House bonded store, where it
lies to-day, while the ingenious discoverers are still living
on the £5O they got for finding and informing.
* * * *
The English Court of Appeal recently framed a
rule that every deponent who, in an affidavit, states
“ his information and belief ” on a point, must give the
source thereof; otherwise the solicitor responsible for the
affidavit must bear the cost of it without any right of
recourse against his client. This regulation is aimed at
the increasing practice of swelling up affidavits with
gossip for which no authority' is given.
• * * *
The Sydney Tailoresses’ Union soon got to
work in demanding an eight-hour day', but only about
half the rate of wages paid the male clothing-makers ' So
long as women can be got to work at half male rates they
will be used to displace men; the women’s political
rights advocates should bracket with their political
demands the concession of equal industrial rights and
wages. Why a woman should not be paid by results for
piecework—as well as a man is paid is hard to under-
stand.
* • * •
“X. 0.”: Some Sydney trade-unions are not
too good at putting their own principles into practice.
In many cases they expect an hon. sec. to do all the work
of the Union practically “ on the nod.” Writer knows
one Union with over 1000 members which won’t pay a
secretary ; and another, with an income of about £2OOO a
year, pays its secretary £l5O a year. What a contrast to
the Bush Unions, which pay their officials £4 and £5 per
week!
* * * *
“ Cove ” : Two years have passed since I washed
my hands of the ownership of a furnished house, to let.
The thing is pleasurable to begin with : What a fool you
are to be petting’ 5 or 6 per cent, for your money when
you can make 15, or more, this way. But soon the
skeleton creeps out of the cupboard. The Fates gave me
all the nice people first, and then came the awful run of
the others. Occupants began to hook it, without paying,
and leaving the key in the front door. There are agents
who live mostly by trucking non-payees from one house
to another. Another class of shifty gents are those who
are constantly having fresh nieces. But this leads me
too much towards the shuddery quagmires into which
the furnished house drifts. Soon I got afraid there would
be a baby buried in the yard, and decided against being
landlord of a furnished house in future.
* * * *
A well-known Sydney jewellery time-payjnent
man, when engaging a new canvasser, always gets his (the
canvasser’s) photo, taken, for police information in case of
default.
* * * •
Complainant in a recent Sydney case was
entrusted by his employer with a fiver to change at a
butcher’s shop close by. ' He met a casual acquaintance,
who had a weird yarn of wanting to pay the same butcher
£3. He couldn’t pay the money in person, as his creditor
had threatened to' punch his head when he got a
chance ; he didn’t want to give him a chance, but
he did want to pay what he owed. So the victim
took the £3, in a purse (it was explained that he might
drop the sovs. without a purse), and for fear that he
might mix up the £3 inside and the £5 he was to change,
his friend offered to mind the bank note. Of course,
there was no £3 or no debt. Neither was there any
friend outside nor any £5. The ingenious prisoner got
six months’ hard. The ingenuous prosecutor—well, the
law at present gives that sort of problem up.

REUTER’S
LITTLE
PILLS FOR
THE LIVER .
Are particularly adapted to the needs
of the family, act in such a manner as to
cause noinconvenience,specially intended
for the cure of all ailments arising from a
disordered LIVER and STOMACH.
After many Years
Of suffering great agony with pains in her back
and head, Miss Ethel Brooks, Kew, Victoria,
found a complete cure—result from the use of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. It is such cases
as this which establish the soundness of the good
results obtained from their use. “ Diseases which
originate in the stomach must be cured through
the stomach.” Every other organ depends on
the stomach for its vitality and vigor, for, by the
stomach and its associated organs of digestion
and nutrition, the food which is eaten is con-
verted into nutriment which, in the form of

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The first of the test-matches between Maclaren’s
team and All Australia commenced at Sydney Cricket
Ground last Friday with a good wicket and weather to
match. Maclaren won the toss and opened the batting
with Hayward, while Jones and Noble conducted the
attack. The Mac. only scored one off the first over, but
slogged Noble for a four and a two in the second, and
settled down to assault and batter the bowling in robust
style. Jones gave place to Howell with the leather, and
Noble seemed to have discovered a kind of ball the
English captain with the Scotch name didn’t exactly like.
The scoring eased off somewhat till the Mac. gave a
fairly easy catch into slips, which Howell failed to con-
firm. By tiffin-time the Englishmen had put up 85 for no
wickets. After lunch M’Leod and Jones resumed theattack
and were slogged round for 139, when Noble gave place
to Laver, and, later, Jones was succeeded by Trumble.
At 154 Hayward slogged Trumble high on the off, and
Hill caught him amid thunders of applause. Then the
luck seemed to change. Tyldesley came out, but he had
only scored one when he was caught by Hill off Trumble,
and was succeeded by Quaife. Maclaren went out leg-
before-wicket, after 3j hours of first-class cricket. Jessop
came on, and the field spread-out apprehensively.
Jessop commenced cautiously enough, but soon broke
loose, and in 15 minutes had hit up five 4’s, sneaked four
singles and been clean bowled by M’Leod. Jones and
Quaife were disposed of for 9 and 21 respectively,
and the stumps were drawn with six English wickets
down for 272. On Saturday morning there seemed to
be a general opinion that the Englishmen were as good as
beaten already, and the five men still alive were spoken
of disrespectfully as “ the tail.” However, when the tail
got to work it proved to be long and hard. The
Australians fielded wretchedly. They clawed at the ball
with both hands and their teeth. They tried to
fall down on top of it, but it got away to the boundary
again and again. The one brilliant episode was when
Trumble, in the slips, sprang up into the air and caught
Blythe (10th wicket), with one hand, off Laver’s ball.
The batting of the Englishmen was artistic: they took
no risks, they gave no chances, but batted on serenely,
and waited for the opportunities to come along. When
they did come, the Britishers carefully placed the ball
where there was no Australian to stop it. When Blythe
was caught, the English total stood at 464.
When the Australians went to the stumps the
awfulness of their fielding became apparent by contrast.
Our men slogged the leather more than the Englishmen;
but it came up against fielding that was like a brick wall.
Gregory and Trumper opened the Australian innings, and
stole runs in a most brazen manner, but, with such deadly
throwing in, it was too dangerous, and they grew more
reserved. In the first five minutes Trumper was caught,
and the score stood one wicket down for three. The Aus-
tralian batsmen settled down, and made heroic efforts to
overtake the long start of the Englishmen, but their efforts
were neutralised by that terrible fielding and lightning-like
throwing in. Twice Hill was all but run out, and the great
Gregory was caught while scoring well in the face of big
difficulties. He and Hill had put up 86 between them.
When Noble joined hfm, Hill played somewhat more
cautiously, and it was necessary. At a few minutes to
six, when the score was only three off the century, Noble
stepped out to smite Braund clean out of the ground. It
was an innocent-looking ball till it struck, when it shot
in. Noble swiped—missed, and before he could step back
to his crease was stumped, for two. Howell came out,
and in the few remaining minutes the Australians suc-
ceeded in carrying the figure to 103. It was not till
Monday that the full tide of disaster fell on them.
Then it came like a tidal wave. The batsmen
were obviously nervous. Blythe and Barnes were bowl-
ing, and Blythe’s infinite variety seemed to get on the
Austral nerves. Hill suddenly cut Barnes to the bound-
ary, but the next ball he chopped right into his wicket,
and the scoring-board showed 4 down, for 112. Then
Howell was caught in the slips by Braund off Blythe.
M‘Leod struggled ineffectually with a ball from Barnes
which took his wicket, and Kelly was bowled by Blythe—
all for 112. Four wickets had fallen without a run being
added to the score. Darling pulled himself together and
made an effort to stem the tide of falling wickets and
shift the curse of 112, but Laver was in difficulties with
the bowling, and Darling could do very little with Blythe’s
curios, backed up with the wall-like fielding, and the
Australians struggled along hopelessly in the face of an
impending donkey-licking. An hour’s play only yielded
34 runs. Australia all out for 168.
Australia (296 behind) followed on, with Darling
and Trumper at the wickets. Darling put all his timber
behind a leg ball which was skimming towards the boun-
dary ■ when Jessop, with a tremendous spring upward,
caught it with one hand. Hill stepped out to drive
Braund, and was bowled for a duck. The English
fielding seemed to be even better than before.
Trumper was caught out at 52 by Lilley at the
wicket off Blythe. Noble went exactly the same way.
M‘Leod was bowled for oby Blythe. Mac. had scored a
brace of fine ducks in the match, one from Blythe and one
from Barnes. Then the sun got in the Englishmen’s eyes,
and they began to miss things. Kelly should have been
out, but was missed by Hayward. Gregory was missed-
in the slips by Braund, but Barnes caught Kelly at point
off Blythe. Gregory and Trumble looked like making a
stand) Trumble slogging Blythe for three fours, two cuts
and a drive. He came to grief playing forward to Barnes,
and was caught by Lilley. Laver joined Gregory and was
stumped for nothing. Howell came out and made some
fours, and Gregory blundered a ball into Maclaren’s hands
at mid-on. Jones joined Howell and the only fragment
of a stand was made. Howell played the game, making
31 runs in 13 minutes, including six fours. Then Jones
skied one, the other Jones caught it on the boundary,
and the Australian second innings closed for 172. The
great match was over, and Maclaren’s allegedly second-
rate team had left Australia away back in the dust behind
the chariot to-the extent of an innings and 124 runs.
* » * «
“J.”: For front the average N.S.W. cricket
barracker wins the average. “ Dick ” Teece, interviewed
immediately after the test-match, suggested, as improve-
ments for the next go, that Jones, Laver and Darling
should be left out. What was the matter with the team,
according to Mr. Teece, was that there were too many
beastly Victorians and South Australians messing about
in it. What is wanted is clearly more men from N.S.W.
Therefore he suggests that we should leave out Laver who
got two wickets, Darling who made the only stand of the
day on Monday, and Jones, off whom Maclaren was missed
at 46 ; and not Howell, the man who missed Maclaren and
only got one wicket; Noble, who failed with both bat and
ball; or Trumper, who showed flukily each time. Unless
the next team is selected under the guidance of clearer-
headed councils than these, Blythe, Braund and co. will
have another romp. y
The one redeeming feature of the Australians’
play Was the. trouble last wicket of the second innings
gave. Bilowell banged away freely and fearlessly, and in
13min. compiled 31, in which there, were six fours.
Sheer, fatuous conceit knocked out Australia.
The local heroes had been boomed by the press until they
believed they had nothing to do but wait till their turn
came at-the wickets and then paste the cover off the
“ feeble” English bowling. Hence slackness in the field,
loose bowling and general want of training-and keenness.
Then Maclaren produced his dark horse, Blythe, and with
him mowed down the blossom of Australian batting
before it came to decent budding-point. The Australians
were confident of getting at least 700 runs on the wicket
provided. But the English fielding, and the three B.’s,
decided otherwise.
A forecast of the next team : Trumper, Darling,
Hill, Noble, Gregory (S.yd.), Jones, M'Beth, Poidevin,
Clark, Kelly, M’Leod, with Trumble as 12th man. Noble
must be retained in spite of failure in one try. Jones had
rotten luck in the match ; Darling cannot be dispensed
with ; M’Leod is the only bowler who came off. Howell
with his one wicket and the general similarity to Noble
and M‘Leod, must stand down. Jones (if he will practise
honestly) will do as well as ever, and, anyhow, you must
have a fast bowler. The three new men suggested are all
from N.S.W. Hack might do better than Poidevin, but
he hasn’t scored off Braund as L.O.S. has. With some-
thing like a return to batting* form, and a little more
swiftness in the field, this troupe should make Maclaren’s
little lot sit up.
* • * *
One clear reason of Australia’s deplorable posi-
tion at the end of test-match No. 1 is the constitutional
incapacity of the Australian to run. To love one’s native
country is a very pure thing, but to prove that love by
the display of a limpet-like attachment to the particular
spot one happens to be standing on in the cricket-field is
to display misplaced emotion. Gregory mo'es about
with some freedom, and Trumper can, on occasions, run
very fast, but the English have a dozen fielders—men like
Jones and Quaife—who are off the mark before the ball is
properly hit, and whose speed is apparently beyond the
possibilities of men burdened with our national tired
feeling.
* * * •
Scutum ” : The ’Stralians made a holy show
of themselves in the first test-match. Most of them
shaped at Braund like schoolboys facing a break bowler
for the first time. Some of them seemed to think that
Braund had something concealed under the pitch which
caught the ball as it touched ground and shied
it into the wicket at an extraordinary angle. But
after much careful searching, and many prods
with the bat, they failed to discover anything
abnormal. Kelly made desperate efforts to knock the
cover off the ball and smash the crowd in the
shilling stand, but his strength was wasted. As a whole
they performed execrably. Gregory stood out above the
rest, but even he never seemed at home. However
praise is due to Barnes (6 for 139), Braund (7 for 101)
Blythe (7 for 56), who bowled splendidly throughout’
Maclaren showed excellent judgment in the placing of his
field, altering their positions for each opposing batsman
as well as to suit his bowlers. His method seems to be to
study the various strokes of each batsman and bis
fallings, and set the field accordingly ; on the other band,
the ’Stralians simply peg away and trust to luck. The
Englishmen likewise made use of their very own umpire
on Saturday : they loaded him up with sweaters and bats
till he looked like an old clo’ man. No doubt Callaway
smiled. To present writer there seem to be marvellous
possibilities in store for the bowler -who can vary his
style of bowling. Blythe sent down a variety in the test,
but he, in common with nine out of ten howlers, makes
a mark from which to start his run. Still, on several
occasions, the ball seemed to leave his hand ere he
actually reached the crease. By varying the style of
bowling is meant changing the method of delivery, i.e.,
the distance of run and the manner of bringing the arm
over. Some years ago, Ironclad 0.C., of Newcastle,
had a bowler who was both-handed. He used to vary bis
bowling by delivering one over from his right hand and
the next from his left, and was fairly successful. But such
instances are rare. In S.M. Herald’s account of the Eng-
lishmen’s first innings, it was stated that M‘ Leod was lucky
in getting Maclaren and Jessop with full tosses. In this
scribe’s humble opinion, bowlers do not make sufficient
use of the full toss. I don’t mean a slow one on the leg,
but a fairly fast one aimed at the top of the wicket
• * * *
Bar Jones, every Australian bowler sent against
the Englishmen in their first innings got one or more
wickets. Jones should have had Maclaren on his list but
for Howell’s mulling. McLeod did best, securing 4 for
84. Trumble’s first showing was when the score topped
100—he accounted for Hayward. “ Points ” Laver and
Noble and “ cover ” Gregory stood out.
• * * *
Jessop’3 first innings lasted 16min., during
which he hit five fours and four ones.
* * * «
Initial innings (Friday last week) of Englishmen
supplied a record for first wicket in test matches played
here. Maclaren and Hayward notched 154 before latter
was caught for 62. Previous best was Ulyett’s and
Barlow’s 122 at Sydney in ’B2. Maclaren and Wain wright
accumulated 111 in ’B9, and Flowers and Read and Brown
and Ward 102 each in ’B5 and ’94 as named. ’Ome record
belongs to Hayward and Jackson—lBs in fifth match of
’99. It’s rather remarkable that Hayward should share
credit in both cases.
* * * *
Clem. Hill grasps the handle of the bat well
down the shoulder, which, though it interferes with free
wrist-play, gives him great command over it. Noble
holds the weapon well up the handle. Hence the differ-
ence in the result when the men jumped out to meet
Braund’s inducers to leave the crease.
• * « *
Oppressed by his run of bad luck in tossing,
Maclaren proposed to the Australians that choice of
innings should alternate in the first four test-matches, a
fresh toss only taking place for the last one. After
deliberation, the local team decided to insist on tossing
anew each match, and the English chief must have
chuckled when he won the first spin of the coin. The
visiting captain’s proposal seems a fair one, but would
certainly arouse opposition. The only other way sug-
gested to minimise the great advantage of winning the
toss is the method that has been adopted in Melb. Pen-
nant matches. There, the side going in first only bats
halt the day, then the fielding side takes 'the wickets,
and so on alternately. This system has not been too
successful. The fact remains that if cricket is reduced to
a science, and luck eliminated from it, the game will lose
considerable charm. Which can also be said of golf,
yachting, and most other pastimes.

Opening-day of first England-Australia test-
match (Sydney)broughtls,ooo onlookers. Visitors dropped
M’Gahey, Garnett, and Robson. Maclaren’s score of 116
brought his runs in test matches to over 1000. His
aggregate at moment of writing is 1049, and average 37-46.
Others with four-figure feats in test matches are Grace,
Shrewsbury, Giffen, Darling(ll39), “ Sid.” Gregory (1086),
and Bannerman. The attendance on Saturday was esti-
mated as verging on 40,000, and the sight was remarkable.
Figures are believed to constitute a world’s record. The
crowd on the occasion of one of Ivo Bligh’s team’s matches
is said to have been as big, but facilities for getting near
accuracy were not so reliable.
* * * »
Ed. Bulletin.—A few thoughts suggested by
the test-match. First, a new captain —someone who
knows something of the placing, of Australian fieldsmen
for English batsmen. In this respect Maclaren easily out-
generalled Darling. Secondly, much is heard of the need
of a goad stonewaller to stop a rot. A stonewaller at one
end usually makes the man at the other end cautious
when wickets are falling. Give us, rather, a batsman of
the Graham type, who would give some confidence to the
others. And why not Graham himself ? Again, the slow
bowler must come, and the man who will probably give
place to him is Howell. Bill is not now the field he used
once to be, and his dropping of an easy catch in the slips,
when Maclaren was 43, probably meant 150 to the Eng-
lishmen. Jones bowled faster and fielded better than in
the S.A. match, but he had no luck. Clarke is men-
tioned as a cert, for the next match, but the slow bowler
who will probably have a place in the Australian XI
before the end of the season is—George Giffen. —G. F.

If the public’s debilitated faith in bike-racing,
as a sport, can survive the result of this year’s Austral
“struggle,” it must be indeed immortal. There was no
secrecy about the things that might be expected to
happen in the big Stakes. Even the daily press, which
usually professes a complete ignorance of scandals apper-
taining to the malodorous Austral, and does its best to keep
the game alive for the sake of the managerial ad. —even
the daily press, prior to the event, made open reference to
this year’s conspiracy'. True, the allegation of fraudulent
intent on the part of some riders (unnamed, of course)
was coupled with a promise that the committee of the
M.B.C. would do its duty to the public. The case was
put in a way calculated to excite interest and swell the
gate receipts. All the same, it was an astounding fact
that the press pleaded guilty to being not quite blind and
deaf, and destitute of the sense of smell.
The Age said on the morning of the Austral :
“ Developments in the betting have given rise to many'
extraordinary rumors as to intrigues, in which several of
those remaining in the contest are alleged to have been
concerned, but there is good reason for believing that the
committee of the Melbourne Bicycle Club will be found
quite prepared to take drastic action in the event of any
reasonable ground for such action being shown by
the running. The competitors will be very dili-
gently watched. Additional time-keepers and um-
pires have been appointed,” &c., &c. The extra-
ordinary rumors—not that any rumors of roguery
can be out of the common in connection with any bicy'cle
race—radiated from the fact that Bill. Martin, whose
recent “ form” didn’t quite justify the betting, was said
to be a “ moral,” and had been backed down to 2 to 1,
6to 4, and evens. And the explanation of the Billmoral
was as follows. A certain person had backed Bill at long
odds to win so much money that his agents could afford
to “ talk reason ” to a sufficient number of Austral
compel itors in various parts of the handicap to clear
the way for a victorious assertion of Bill’s trustworthy
skill, strength and pluck. Everything that money' could
do for the champion had been done by Bill’s backer, who
took it for granted that William would do the rest and
make an honest effort to win. A comparatively slow
pace was the first essential to a bringing off of the
coup. Therefore the stewards, had they been deter-
mined to declare a “no race” in the event of it
not seeming to be run on its merits (rule 73) would have
concentrated the attention of all their extra timekeepers
and umpires on the front mark men. They knew that
scratch-man Bill was the person for whom the event was
said to have been “ fixed,” and that it couldn’t be so fixed
if the front-mark men did their level best to retain their
handicap advantage among themselves, and show their
wheels to the back-markers from start to finish.
* * • *
The Bill Martin Stakes, as it turned out accord-
ing to prediction, was run in lOsec. slower time than last
year’s Austral. Also, this final heat was slow by compari-
son with the heats that the limit men had run on the
previous Saturday, and Bill Martin won in 4.29 3-ssec.
Heaven knows what the time might have been, but for
Lewis’s decent attempt to win on his own. Everything
had happened as per prediction, but inasmuch as good old
Bill, prediction or otherwise, was the best of ail winners
from a showman’s point of view, the stewards saw
nothing suspicious, except in Frank Beauchamp’s sprint.
They disqualified him for 12 months. He was one of the
few men whom rumor had declared to be honest triers.

Whisperings anent final of the Austral, and the
look of the thing should give Vic. legislator Wynne’s bill
for suppressing betting at sports meetings a big shove.
Maximum penalty for an offence is £2O. Persistence in
betting when ordered to stop will bring about arrest, and
persons entering a sports ground after being legally re-
moved incur a penalty of £5O and gaol for three months.
It isn’t likely that Mo will come again. Last year knocked
him limp, and this time he has been completely' flattened
out. Three Melbourne Moseses had a five-thou. book,
which was all snapped up atop of many less amounts
from the smaller fry. Said that Plugger Bill scooped a
fortune and won’t race again. Prize-money was : Winner,
£4OO ; second, £75 ; and third, £25.

Little Tartar got away with Q.T.C. Sandgate
Handicap on Saturday from a field of 13, embracing
Derby and Cup winners. A season or two since Little
Tartar was in Warwick Farm (N.S.W.) stable with a great
reputation, hut did no good and went back to Q. to land
a few prizes and wagers. Bred at Dryaaba (Clarence
River) by late Mr. H. Barnes, L.T. is half-brother, by the
Musket horse Tartar, to the speedy Nardoo, who could
beat the best of ’em at pony meetings. Bigger surprise
still was the squelching of Boreas 11. in the Stanley Plate
w.f.a. race, lm. 3f. Starting at odds on in a field of three
he went under to the Derby winner, Narelle, with Brise-
de-Nuits second.

Result of Bananaland Cup was remindful of
last Melbourne Cup, in that the winner (Drake), like
Revenue, hadn’t previously won a race for two years, and
yet was much fancied by his stable. He is a fine chestnut
that takes the eye well, and was bred in Q. central district
by Mr. Hatfield. His sire, The Drake, still does stud duty,
though 27 years old. His dam, Decoy, is by Golds-
borough from Sunbeam, by The Barb from Sweetheart
(imp.), by Red Heart. Time (3'3l£) is a record for the
race.

Rosehill meet Saturday last caused much weep-
ing and wailing in the ranks of Mo. who, despite the fact
that betting was good on most races, lost to a man.
Finishes, on the whole, were soft things for the winners,
though big fields lined up. Only close go of the day was
Pelissier’s December Handicap. Outsider Barley Bree
rounded the home turn two lengths away, but com-
mencing the last furlong Pelissier got level, and a neck and
neck tussle saw Pelissier pass the post a head to the good.
Three first and three second favorites won the six events.

Manner of Baccarat’s shaping at Moorefield a
week or two since brought her heaps of support for
Rosehill Nursery Handicap. She won easily, and in such
a way as to suggest that when she is after it again, and
the company isn’t absolutely first-class, she’ll be worth
an investment. Baccarat is by the Merton stallion
Dalmeny from All Fours.

Neither bruiser Turner nor bruiser Youngshowed
better than ordinary form at Sydney Golden Gate A.O.
Saturday night, and Turner won a scrambling thing that
gave everybody the blues. How his people sum him up
as having a hope against Melbourne “ Micko ” Walsh, and
why “ Micko ” doesn’t walk from Melb. to take on the
soft snap is a puzzle. Young and Turner were brought
together because the Waterloo (Sydney) iron-encased lad
Lenton had fought a draw with each, but “ form ” in the
pug. biz has rarely panned out right.
Athletic Union supremacies of the continent
will be contested at Auckland (M.L.) this Friday.
Neither N.S.W. nor Q. have anything like their best
teams. Victoria is most fortunate of all visiting sections,
with 10 reps., and among them the cream of the State.
N.S.W. has six, and Q. four. Absence of Rowley, English,
M’Alister and others weakens the Loan State ; while the
Bananalanders’ prospects would have been considerably
enhanced by the presence of Hawkes. Summed up, it
doesn’t look as if Victoria, N.S.W., or Q. has a hope
against M.L., though combined they might make it a
close thing.

This cablegram was printed last week :
There are now no British troops north of the Delajroa
Bay line.
If that is true it amounts to the astounding fact
that the Boers have recovered temporary posses-
sion of more than half the Transvaal. “ What is
truth?” said Pilate. Pilate had evidently been
reading the cablegrams, and had dropped the
paper and taken off his helmet to let the cool
breeze from the Dead Sea blow on his staring head
when he said it.
William M'Millan, importer :
I advocate the fixing- of a duty which will not have the
effect of reducing imports.
No doubt. The rising of local industries which
would reduce imports may be good for Australia,
but it isn’t good for the importer. Again, spe.ik-
ing of Sydney :
It is very curious to note that the trade in a State with
a free port is honeycombed by thousands of agents for
manufacturers. The place is swamped with consign-
ments.
MADE

SYDNEY
Is synonymous with well made. The Brooches we illustrate are
good, solid, well-made Brooches, and will wear a life-time. They
are so different to the 6-carat German and Birmingham made light
jewellery that is so generally illustrated in Sydney.
We have an enormous stock of Brooches—perhaps the most
numerous in Sydney. We make them in quantities.
The prices are less than the Imported ones were under
Freetrade. We have not raised oar Prices.

Kaiser William, talking to his German
contingenters before they sailed for China, told
them to repay sundry “ outrages ” to the Father-
land Flag with 100 per cent., and give the Chows
a horribly bad time. And now two Berlin
journalists have been gaoled for publishing yarns
to the effect that the German troops were
murderous when they got the chance.
A woman-canvasser raises, in Sydney E.
News, a horrified squeal over the fact that, in some
Government offices, employees are, during hot
weather, occasionally discoverable in their shirt-
sleeves. The Bulletin had not thought that
anything so sensible was allowed in Government
offices, and hopes that no official notice will be
taken of the cackle of the kind of meddlesome hen
that necessitates the term “lydy” as a variant
upon “lady.” A lady doesn’t anxiously quest
around for shocks to her propriety.
Freetrader Cameron, of Tasmania, brought
a South Australian and an imported plough-
share into the House of Reps, t’other day, and
became quite violent, in a small Tasmanian
way, about the alleged inferiority of the local
article. Cameron’s superior imported share was
an American one, produced under a stupendous
Protective tariff, so the apparent inference is that
when Australia, has as much Protection as the
U.S., and has it as long,, it may do equally good
work. Anyhow, the spectacle of a Freetrader
holding forth, as a proof of the advantages of
Freetrade, about the excellence of an implement
made under about the heaviest Protective tariff
on earth has its humorous side.
Wondrous sample of the importing party’s
logic from report of House of Reps, debate :
Mr. Willis (N.S.W.), argued that no protection of the
implement industry was necessary, as was evidenced by
the fact that South Australia had been able to send
ploughshares to N.S. Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania,
and successfully compete with all foreign makers.
Which may be summed up thus
(1) South Australia, under Protection, could produce
ploughshares at such a low price that it could compete
with all foreign makers, even in the‘'N.S.W. free market.
Therefore, Protection didn’t raise the price as alleged.
This proves that Protection should be abolished and that
Foreign-trade is the only i sound policy.
(2) If South Australia, hnder Protection, couldn’t pro-
duce ploughshares as cheap as the imported article that
would also prove that Protection should be abolished and
that Foreign-trade is the only sound policy.
(3) N.S. W. under its Foreign-trade policy didn’t pro-
duce ploughshares to any extent. That also proves
Foreign-trade to be the only sound policy.
The people of Holland, who have been
deriving a lot of mild satisfaction from their local
libels on King Edward since his poor old mother
ceased to be a cartoon subject, have now got their
own royal fish to fry. After nine months of
matrimony, the German prince-consort of Queen
Wilhelmina, who is said to be an absurdly
arrogant young potentate, asserted his semi-
divine right to come home drunk to dinner, and
was nagged by his royal missus until lie told her
to go to —we dunno the Dutch equivalent for it.
Whereupon the lodger—otherwise Her Majesty’s
aide-de-camp—took the lady’s part and a duel
ensued, with bad results to the lodger. After
which another “courtier” was kicked in the
bread-basket for interfering between man and
wife. The Dutch court case ought to be well
worth watching. Which way are the sympathies
of the fiery 20-year-old Queen going “to jump?
Does she pity the lodger who took up arms on her
account, or feel inclined to worship the German
husband who wasn’t too drunk to make him sorry
he spoke ? At latest accounts she was sticking to
her old man : a queen is nevertheless a woman.
Apropos the butter-box controversy, the
manager of Tweed River (N.S.W.) Creamery
Co. asserts that he has used local pine for the last
three years with every success.
Broken Hill just now has two men very
badly “set.” These men, on a recent holiday,
when 800 or 900 of the Hill’s hard-drinkers were
picnicking at Stephen’s Creek, lay low for a couple
of sly-grog-sellers. One man went into a shanty,
pretended sudden illness, and asked for brandy—
which was given him, and paid for. Result,
prosecution of the shanty-man and a £5O fine.
The shanty-keepers have now a special bottle
ready for the next man who takes ill on their
premises.
An interesting perjury case was lately
tried before the Ruthyn (Wales) assizes. The
confessed perjuress was a Manchester girl,
who seemingly came along to manage the
refreshment dept, at a fine-arts museum in a
Welsh town of unpronounceable name. At first
her success was great. She knew a thing or two
more than the ordinary girl associated with
museums. Pretty soon she was engaged to the
local schoolmaster, and became “an active church
worker,” and the curate spoke of her in a general
way as “ our dear sister.” After a while the local
matrons drew unfavorable conclusions from the
appearance—the “figure ” —of Miss Redfern, late
and she was asked to retire from
the fine-arts refreshment bar. So she appealed to
theschool master, telling him that he must be the
father of her future child, but the schoolmaster
would have nothing more to do with the siren.
Then Miss Redfern threw herself and her sha-a-me
on the sympathy of the curate, and the curate
gave her enough money to get her through her
trouble. Therefore the grateful girl transferred
her allegations from the tough schoolmaster to the
gentle shepherd, and ultimately obtained an
affiliation order against him. For years the
curate was a wandering outcast, and the school-
master walked in the shadow of respectable sus-
picion. Then a bundle of letters came to light,
letters written by the barmaid to a gardener em-
ployed at the museum gardens. Result : a full
confession by both parties of how the gardener used
to interview Miss Redfern in her room at night by
means of a rope ladder. His name was Madoc Jones
and her child was his child, and he had wanted
to marry her, but she “considered him beneath
her,” she said. The schoolmaster, being a person
of higher standing, Miss Redfern hoped to bounce
or wheedle him into matrimony, whereupon he
advised her to put the baby down to the curate if
she wanted a good ‘ ‘ mark ” for blackmail. Per-
haps the pedagogue had been jealous of her active
interest in church work, or more likely this part
of her confession was a lie invented to damage her
former sweetheart. The two things quite
beyond question in this sweet story are
the rope-ladder liaison (on one occasion a
head gardener removed the ladder, and Don Juan
had to let himself down by a sheet), and the girl’s
profound sense of social superiority to the man
who catered for her passion. What a satire on the
orthodox magisterial injunction to marry the girl,
and make her respectable ! The holy contract of
matrimony, as the candid Miss Redfern sees it, is
an arrangement by which a woman may lose caste
if she enters into it with the lover on whom she
bestowed her favors.

Slowbart Mercury (same editor for 40
years) persists in holding the Labor party respon-
sible for the high tariff and uses dreadful language
—the mild Hobart kind of dreadful, that is. The
high tariff is so low that Tasmania seems likely to
go bankrupt under it unless a lot more direct
taxation is imposed, and a large section of the
Labor party is trying to cut it down further and
make Tasmania more bankrupt still. But a man
who has edited a dreadful paper like the Mercury
for 40 years can’t be expected to notice a little
thing like that.

"Hoehtah!"-A Song of Woman's Eyes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oall night they say to me j
Hooshtah !
J Wheresoever I may flee:
Hooshtah !
“Man ! kneel down upon the sand
Till we bind you with our band
Hooshtah!
Camel-like, I hear them cry :
Hooshtah /
In the valleys or on high :
Hooshtah ! Hooshtah /
’Mid the roses or the gums,
Lo, the order gently comes —
Hooshtah /
And I kneel me gravely down—
Hooshtah! Hooshtah /
By the forest or the town —
Hooshtah /
By the sea’s imperial way
I must kneel me and obey
Hooshtah !
Down in meadowlands of sleep—
Hooshtah!
Doth the order slyly creep—
Hooshtah !
Sweet young eyes for ever call:
“On your knees, O Mammal, fall! ”
Hooshtah I Hooshtah l
And they load me with soft sighs—
Hooshtah !
With dear glances of their eyes :
Hooshtah 1
Bales of bliss they place on me,
As they chatter by the sea—
Hooshtah ! Hooshtah /
It is pleasant labouring—
Hooshtah !
Where the eyes for ever sing
Hooshtah ! Hooshtah l
May I be a camel aye !
Gladly hearing sweet eyes say
Hooshtah l
Life’s a desert for us all—
Hooshtah l
Till the dear eyes softly call
Hooshtah 1
But the desert doom grows dim,
When there rings o’er Silence’ rim,
Hooshtah ! Hooshtah !
Far and near, O hear them cry,
Hooshtah !
Darling eyes half wet, half dry,
Hooshtah !
Call me, sweet eyes, when you will,
I’ll kneel for you though you kill !
Hooshtah !

GRANT HERVEY.
“ Robert Brothers ” writes to The Bulle-
tin of Maoriland women in politics :
Theoretically, women should be enfranchised. All the
argument favors giving her the vote. The woman of
Maoriland have had the franchise of Maoriland a long
time now. When I travelled M.L. and talked with many
hundreds of women, I wanted to see how much in-
terest they would take in the affairs of a country, and
I tried to draw them out ; but, after all my efforts, I
could only get them to look tired and change the sub-
ject at the first opportunity.
The municipal elections were on in Greymouth when
I was there, and every woman over 21 went to the
poll, and enjoyed going. I was talking to one of those
red-faced bushwomen, with an arm on her like a leg
of mutton. She had a husband and seven or eight
daughters, and she told me that they were all going
to- vote for So-and-So. So-and-So was not a nice-look-
ing man. (It is' all bosh about the women
voting for nice-looking men.) But he meant to put
down the drink traffic. And that was why my
friend Biddy was going to vote for him, and make all the
family vote for him. And now I have travelled all Maori-
land, and talked to women in every town, I know that
prohibition is about the only question that interests the
woman-voter.
Yet the average Maorilander is a very sober fellow. It
seems marvellous that so big an outcry should be made
for such a little cause. The M.L. woman has done part
of her business, and that part very badly. After so many
years of temperance legislation the temperance man
heaves a sigh, and admits that it has proved futile. In
days gone by there were many hotels and much drinking
done. I mean much in his eyes ; not in mine accustomed
to the heavier drinking in Australia. The only change
now is that more drinkers go into one bar; and those
men who are lucky enough to have licenses are reaping
big harvests. Prohibition, therefore, has only made
hotel-keeping a better investment, and hotel properties
more valuable. That is one result brought about by the
women in politics.
But they have done more than that. There were men
who had made sufficiently respectable livings out of
hotelkeeping who lost their licenses, and many of these
set up sly grog-selling. Now, sly grog-shops do not sup-
ply pure liquors Then some greater attraction is wanted
than drink, so attractive girls with loose morals are sup-
plied. And, in the third place, only those frequent sly
grog-shops who are likely to be most harmed—young
fellows rising out of their teens, fellows who would not go
into a public-house for the sake of a stimulant, but who
patronise the sly grog-shop because of the distinction it
gives them in their own estimation as men about town,
and the excitement supplied by the loose girls. And that
is the other and worse result of M.L. women in politics.
They have made sly grog-selling pay.
Somehow the average woman doesn’t seem built for
politics. Up at Tuggerah, N.S.W., I once heard a fisher-
man say that he would vote for Protection because then
he wouldn’t have his baskets stolen. Well, the end and
aim of the Maoriland woman seems to be to give her vote
solely to keep her old man from going into the public-
house on his way home on pay-day.
Apropos the above. Theoretically men
should be enfranchised. There is absolutely no
reasonable ai’gument against it. The men of
N.S.W. have had the vote a long time now.
When the writer travelled round at the last
election he talked with a score or two of men to
see how much interest they would take in the af-
fairs of their own country. Many told him they
would vote for old Reid because he wasn’t a
bad sort, and “could sling his slack.” Several
others voted for another candidate “because
he’s a member of our cricket club.” All
the same, writer doesn’t see that that is
any reason why men should not be allowed
to vote. Mr. Brothers’ idea seems to be that
because Prohibition is the chief subject the
collective Maoriland woman is interested in, she
should be deprived of a vote. Will Mr. Brothers
say how many subjects one should be interested
in to qualify for a vote? Also, how many subjects
is Mr. Brothers interested in ?


Premier Barton does not inquire suffi-
ciently into departmental matters, but trusts to
his official “ remembrancer,” with the result that
some of his answers to questions in Parliament
are far from accurate. Supporters of the Govern-
ment are always complaining of these little errors.
Cabled that Roosevelt derides the idea of
U.S. interference in S’Africa. We should smile !
England stands by while Roosevelt and co. grab
the Philippines to perfect their tobacco-monopoly ;
and Roosevelt, like a good business man, returns
the compliment.
What miserable piffle is thought worthy
of the cable nowadays? Just been wired to the
Australian dailies that English cricket-captain
Maclaren “ has been appointed assistant-treasurer
to the Hampshire County C.C.” If it had even
been full treasurer, now !
Obit: In Maoriland, that well-known
Sydney identity, Abraham Friedman, of Castle-
reagh-st. However tough Abraham was as a
lender, he had little personal luck as a speculator ;
he failed to lay to his book. The cigars he gave
to his clients were always of irreproachable
quality.
A collision, which might easily have proved
a terrible disaster, occurred in Port Jackson on
Saturday night last between the harbor-ferry
steamer Lady Hampden and the Colonial Sugar
Co.’s s.s. Fiona. The former, which was much
damaged, had 300 persons aboard. According to
all accounts a large number of the young men
passengers looked carefully to their own safety,
and rushed a relieving steamer for first places at
the expense of the women.
Sydney D.T., trying hard to take its
newspaper postage with dignity, swears only at
the “glaring anomaly” that if 500 newspapers
‘ ‘ weighing eight ounces each are posted separately
to different addresses the stamp charges would be
just the same as if the whole 500 were sent in a
bulk parcel to the one address.” How carefully
it failed to discover the anomaly of allowing 500
paper to go free separately when they were
allowed to go likewise in bulk !
A correspondent to a N.S.W. country
paper alleges—
Before the local P.M. a laborer was fined £2 for using
indecent language ; another laborer, also charged with
same offence, was fined £5 ; then the Mayor of the town
was summoned for insulting language. He was dis-
charged (although he admitted using words equally as
offensive as those the laborers were charged with), the
P.M. expressing a wish that the defendant being Mayor
the newspapers should suppress the proceedings.
The Department of Justice should assuredly
investigate the incident.

British-Indian and German troops in China. In
Hung Chang evidently knew what he was talking
about when he said, “The foreign devils will
begin to fight among themselves. i
■cert” in China is full of discords, and the real
seriousness of this little affair lies m the fac a
it will increase the bitterness aroused m Germany
by Chamberlain’s comparison of German proceed-
ings in France with British proceedings in
S’Africa. The cases are not parallel, and Giiam-
foerlain let his zeal run away with his discretion.
“ History as she is wrote.’ From Sydney
D.T. , ..
Mr. Eyre early began to interest himself in exploration,
and in 1836 conducted an expedition across the Aus-
tralian continent from Sydney to Swan River, W.A.
Eyre’s journey round the Great Bight occurred in
1840-41. No one crossed from settlement in
N.S.W. to settlement in W.A. in 1836.
“ Melb. Man” : Concerning the statement
that The Bulletin, in spite of being “ forbidden,”
gets to S’Africa to a greater extent than any
■other Australasian paper, the evidence of traders
in this city is conclusive. The S’African circula-
tion of The Bulletin is shown by the number ox
inquiries after special goods advertised in its
columns. For instance, Baden Powell (of all
people) lately wrote to the Daylesford Mineral
Water Co. asking further particulars of their
aerated water machine, and a letter from another
officah at the front disclosed the fact that Barnum
P. had written on information received from the
outlawed publication, which is red from cover to
cover.
The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency
Co., Limited, reports Wheat : Some important trans-
actions during the week have taken place, the shippers
being the principal operators, and as a consequence of
their eagerness to secure prime grain the market for such
descriptions has for the time being materially improved,
and for the best Western samples as high as 2s. 10id. has
been reached. Chickwheat, too, commands relatively
high rates, and is worth to 2s. Bd. per bushel. Flour con-
tinues on a comparatively low rate, and the millers cannot
afford at present rates of wheat to operate, except for im-
mediate requirements.*

The Slaughter of the Children.
During October and November there were 5933
deaths among the Boer prisoners confined in
Ketehener’s concentration camps, and 4904 of the
victims were children. For the two previous
months (August and September) 2474 children
died, so the figures are mounting up. At the
present rate of extirpation, the whole of the children
of the Boer race will be hilled off in much less than
two years. The servile Jingo papers still describe
the process of confining women and children in
places where the average life of the confinee
is about twenty-four months, with the alter-
native of burning them out and turning them
adrift without food and shelter in the desert,
as pampering an ungrateful enemy and consigning
her to a palatial existence of unaccustomed luxury,
and so on. But the facts are difficult to explain
away, and the Jingo paper has a hard row
to hoe. The most common explanation now is
to the effect that the chief cause of the awful
mortality is the insanitary habits of the Boer
women and their inefficiency as child-nurses,
which is hardly a convincing lie, all things
taken into account. When the Boer womaTn
is in her own home, and away from the surround-
ings now provided for her by the kindly
Ketchener, she is likely to be just as ignorant
and insanitary as at any other time. Yet the
Transvaal is a country with a low death-rate, and
the Boer child dies off less rapidly than most other
children. In Ketchener’s concentration camps,
where the Boer woman surely can’t have ac-
quired any extra ignorance through association
with the Britisher, the Boer child, among alleged
surroundings of unaccustomed luxury, dies several
dozen times faster than the average. And there
is always the lingering suspicion that if an
examination of the concentration camps would
convince any ordinary person that the hideous
mortality is not Ketchener’s doing, and that
the natural and incurable degradation of the
Boer is wholly responsible, these camps would
be open to a certain amount of inspec-
tion, the Red Cross nurses would not have
been ejected from them, and Miss Emily
Hobhouse, the English lady whom Ketchener, m
an absent-minded moment, admitted to a view of
the inner working of the machine, wouldn t have
been so furiously driven off the premises.
Ketchener and Chamberlain have tried themselves
in secret tribunal over the matter, and found
themselves not guilty, but that species of trial is
apt to be inconclusive.
At Poverty Point.
Melba sent good wishes and regrets that she could not
be present, to Amy Castles the night ot her London
concert. . . .
After all, London press comments seem to -criticise
Amy Castles not as an artist, but as a student.
Albert Whelan, Australian mimic (whose success
abroad, by the way, The Bulletin somewhat enthusi-
astically prophesied) gets a whole bill to himself at
London Empire, with his name in green letters as long as
a page of Hansard, and the rest of the show in purple.
This is indeed fame.
Sydney last week saw two theatrical managers (Denham
and Fuller) hiring expensive legal assistance, and de-
manding blood and hair and damages, over a question of
the right to “The Kelly Gang a stage-howl that
nobody of any literary instinct would care to have found
in his dust-barrel. Long extracts from the dreadful
thing were read to a dazed Judge, who probably never
magined before that the world contained such literature.
A truly extraordinary likeness was the resemblance of
Clarence Harvey (of Josephine Stanton co.), as Beppo, in
“Fra Diavolo,” to John Cole, as “the tramp, in the
panto, of “ The Babes in the Wood,” produced here a few
veare ago. Face, figure, voice, action, were wonderfully
alike ■ yet nothing is more certain than that neither is a
copy ’of the other. It might be worth some manager s
while to try them as the “ two Dromios.”
Several vears ago, Dan Barry’s dramatic co. showed for
one night'at Wellington, N.S.W., and, after the second
act, Dan appeared before the curtain to return thanks.
He told his audience that he had travelled thousands of
miles in his time, and had never been so impressed with a
place as he had been with Wellington (cheers). The
scenery was beautiful, climate superb, and the people
pictures of health and happiness. Next night the co.
appeared at Davisville, eight miles distant, and Dan
again toed the footlights with much the same pitch. A
man in the audience, who had attended the performance
the night previous, interjected, “Oh! you told them
that at Wellington last night ” ; whereupon returned the
ever-ready Dan —“ Yes j but I hadn t seen Davisville
then 1 ”
Percy Grainger, who in ’O4, as a 12-year-old boy, cap-
tured Melbourne concert-goers with his golden curls and
correct fingering, was, at latest, in London, where he made
his debut at a recital in Steinway Hall. His playing gets
most encouraging notices from the leading critics. Six
vears at Frankfort, under Kwast, have transformed him
into a slim youth with the stereotyped yellow mane
(straight) and soulful expression necessary to a successful
pianist.
The hairy Australian millionaire played by Walter
Baker in “ Hearts are Trumps” is a very English concep-
tion of the article. Millionaire Baker is certainly sup-
posed to have emigrated from England, and made his
fortune in a Tysonian way, but that doesn t quite justify
his Lancashire-Yarkshire dialect and his gloomy refer-
ences to “graves wi’out headstones, and bones wiout
craves.” Australian experience “way oop in the dry
North” doesn’t incline a capitalist to tragic oracular
remarks. ,
The Leigh-Pierce comedy co. has played a lengthy
season at Bloemfontein, S.A.-“a town which prior to
the war, was only a three to six nights stand. A curious
licht is thrown upon the local situation by the pass here

George Musgrove seems to have told an Argus inter-
viewer that his “Aladdin” panto, at Melb. Princess’s
will “make a new departure in laying the scene in
China " “ Aladdin ” was a Chinese costume and lantern
show when present scribe saw it in London long long ago.
Also Widow Twankey dwelt in Pekin when “ Aladdin
was last staged in Melbourne—by Williamson and Garner,
at the Royal. By the way, Florence Young appeared in
tights for the first time in that 1890 panto., and Ada Lee,
now of Arnold’s co., was the frisky “ Genius of the Ring.
Plain Bill Holloway has retired from the stage, his fare-
well being given in S’Africa. He had been 36 years on
the boards, and thought that his life work was done. His
daughter, Juliet Sydney, also retires, bn the ground of
ill-health. .
A certain dramatic co., pretty well-known in Australia,
has, according to M.L. papers, had a wild time in Wanga-
nui district. As an excited crowd of creditors was under-
‘stood to be hanging about the railway-station, the princi-
pals drove to Aramoho Junction, where the scouts
reported that more enraged creditors were waiting. So
the principals went on to Fordell, and there struck a
third commando of people, who dealt out blue paper in
terrific stvle. Then the train came in, and the elder pro-
prietor was almost rent in several parts. His co., which
was on board the train, seized his head and shoulders
his creditors, who were on the platform, grabbed his feet
and pants What gave way is not related, but the ? nd of
ft was that theco. on the train hauled the fragments of
their man on board, and steamed away in triumph.
«< q e ” . Josephine Gassman’s pioaninnies are quaint
and amusing little cusses, particularly the tiny watch-
eHition of Irving Sayles, but I’m more interested

browns in cuticle. Josephine’s skin is about the richest
satiny-brown I’ve ever struck, and it fits her without a
wrinkle It seems to me that that pure brown, flawless

pinks and whites of Europeans wilt beside it and look

Strong-man Sampson, who was in Sydney a couple
years back, was recently, at Hamburg, severely mauled
by the Polar bears with which he had been performing.
He had, per programme, wrestled with and thrown one of
the brutes, when the other six escaped from the cage and
fell fiercely upon the man and their comrade, one of them
stripping the flesh and breaking the bones of Sampson’s
forearm. The small Hercules, however, added yet
another to his extraordinary list of quick recoveries.
When in Sydney, he burst a gastric bloodvessel, and, later
on, in St. Petersburg, his “ Roman Column ” gave way
and one of his thumbs was torn out. A similar accident
in Paris caused the dislocation of Sampson’s right knee;
and again, in Buenos Ayres, the platform, upon which he
was supporting 12 women, came down and crushed him
nearly to death. He then invested in £3OOO worth of
Polar bear, with the result above set forth.


THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne, is the largest buyer of
Opals, Sapphires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their parcels direct to him. The firm has
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honorably treated. A trial par-
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance,
is solicited.
A London P. M. lately fined a man £2 and
costs for keeping dogs that barked at night time.
The magistrate laid it down that if the barking of
the dogs annoyed two or more persons defendant
was liable for creating a public nuisance.
From the new paper started by Frank
Harris (late editor of the Fortnightly Review) :
The Duke of Cornwall and York, strange to say, though
born and bred here, speaks with as German an acoent as
do his mother and his aunt, Princess Christian. The
King himself burrs his r’s very oddly, and the Queen has
a most pronounced accent, which a Danish lady tells me
is German-English, and not Danish-English. Her father
and mother, the King and Queen of Denmark, were both
of German stock, and spoke Danish always in strong
German, to the vexation of the people, who loved them
well, and had no other fault to find with a very charming
couple. Queen Alexandra is so beautiful, and her praises
are sung so often, that it may be forgiven to one to hint
that her voice alone is not perfection. A little harsh and
guttural, it hardly seems to belong to her. I hear, in this
connection, that a young girl, engaged in embroidering
the pall for the late Queen’s coffin, remarked, after she
had been interviewed by every English and foreign
royalty at Osborne, “ After all, the Kaiser is the only one
who can really speak English.”
It is seriously proposed in U.S.A. to
change the name of the Philippines to the
M‘Kinley Islands. The awful prospect of being
known as “M‘Kinleyinos” is perhaps responsible
for the recrudescence of revolt among thePilipinos,

A SLUGGISH LIVER
Newcastle Proof for
Newcastle Readers.
A Lesson Worth Learning.
The Case of
Mr. D. LEACH.
(BY A NBWGASTLE REPORTER.)
The work of the press is usually of in-
finite public benefit in its immediate re-
sults, as it paves the way for all those bene-
ficent reforms to which all progressive
people are aspiring. Complete evidence was
lately obtained by a reporter from Mr.
Daniel Leach, of Downie-street, Smedmore,
Newcastle, to justify the above opinion, but
to those to whom the subject is unfamiliar a
perusal of the words of Mr. Leach is re-
spectfully commended.
“ When I left Ratcliffe,” said Mr. Leach,
“ which is a small town about seven miles
from Manchester, I came straight to New-
castle and have been working there ever
since, which embraces a period of a dozen
years. Three years prior to that I was in a
very bad state of health, my internal organs
being s> much upset after an accident in
which my shoulder bone was broken that I
could not get my food to agreed with me
I suffered from a sluggish liver, it was evi-
dent, and the drowsiness which came over
me after meals was distressing ”
What sort of an appetite did you have ? ”
en pared the reporter.
A very fickle one. Some days I felt
hungry and so i e days I had no appetite at
all. When I had eaten freely my stomach
became bloated out, and I felt considerable
pain as if the food was fermenting. If I ate
but very little the same unpleasantness was
experienced, so it was quite plain that in-
digestion was one of my ailments. I became
so melancholy that I lost all interest and
pleasure in life, and the awful depression in
my spirits was even worse when I got up to
work in the mornings, as my loss of energy
was so great that I felt thoroughly incap-
able of lasting the days out. Every evening
I returned home feeling very weary and
fagged out, there not being a diain of
vitality left in my system; but the curious
part of it was that I could not sleep when I
went to bed. My brain was never at rest,
as I started thinking directly my head
rouched the pillow, and as the hours
dragged slowly along my misery increased,
for when the clock pointed to the hour to
arise my limbs were aching intensely, and I
was almost too exhausted to get up. The
only variety I h id was by occasionally fall-
ing asleep for a little time, and then the
most unhappy dreams came to my mind and
woke me abruptly. My tongue was as dry
is a piece of vood, and I also had a foul
taste in the mouth. A fearful pain in my
chest came after I had eaten a little food,
and those pains went right through to the
back and hurt me betw’een the shoulders.
Sometimes there was a sinking sensation in
my stomach as if I were on the point of
starvation, but when food was placed before
mel sickened at the sight of it. I lingered on
like this from w- ek to week, suffering acutely
from aches acrosß my loins, and anxious
fears obtruded on my mind btM.use of my
heart palpitating. This gen. rally happened
when I had been exerting myself by walk-
ing a little distance, but at other times my
heart started beating and thumping with-
out any apparent cause. A strange feeling
came to my eyes, as if they were swollen,
and some days my sight was so bad that
everything I looked at appeared to be
clo ked in a mist. You must know that 1
was quite a young man when all this trouble
c me, and it was a serious thing for me to
be wasting away like I was, and with my
nervous system so terribly affected that I
was set all of a shake by the slightest noise,
besides continually fearing that something
of a dreadful nature was going to take place.
The irregular condition of my bowels was
very injurious, but what was I to do?
Nothing gave me permanent relief from con-
stipation, and the same remark applies to
all my ailments. As I had to work for my
living my daily loss of strength was making
my future look very black, and anybody
who has suffered like I have can understand
what a matter for great rejoicing it was
when I found a medicine to give me re-
lief.”
“ Was it prescribed for you ? * asked the
newspaper man.
“ No. I was very fortunate in saving
doctor’s expenses, as the medicine I took
was simply through reading some of the ex-
traordinary cures which had been effected
by using Clements Tonic. What had cured
others might possibly help me, I thought,
so I sent for some Clements Tonic and began
to take it. When I had drunk two bottles
my appetite had so improved that I could
eat nearly as well as ever, and the pains
were not half so bad as they had been. I
was quite satisfied with the advance I had
already made, and did not lose any time in
providing myself with more Clements
Tonic, which steadily imparted vigor to my
weakened system, and as I got the full
benefit of the food I could now relish I need
hardly tell you that I was soon strong
enough to work all day without feeling the
least distress. To promote digestion I found
that Clements Tonic could not be equalled,
as there were none of those inconveniences
resulting from flatulence after I had been
taking that medicine a while, and my chest
was quite free from the oppression which
had almost smothered me. Bodily pains
were gradually extinguished by Clements
Tonic, and I was exceedingly glad to find
that my heart palpitations had ceased to
exist, while as a nerve-toning medicine I am
sure I was taking the best it was possible to
obtain, for my nervousness disappeared
completely, and my system was invigorated
throughout. It was a remarkable restora-
tion to health which I experienced through
using Clements Tonic, which gave me per-
fect freedom from all my ailments, and as I
continued to use that medicine till my
health was sound in every way it is only
fair to give all the credit to Clements 1 onic.
“ Have you had any illness since then ? ”
“ A few years ago I had four of my ribs
broken, and my system was broken down
again for a while. Indeed, I got intensely
weak and miserable, but I knew what to
fall back upon by my first experience, and
with the use of a few bottles of Clements
Tonic I was made strong and vigorous as
before. Working in the mines is very ex-
hausting labor at the best of times, but in
summer it is particularly hard on the con-
stitution, and when I feel that the strain is
commencing to tell on my strength I get a
bottle or two of Clements Tonic to keep my-
self in proper working order, and the result
is that I am always healthy and happy.”
“ You have adopted a wise plan, Mr.
Leach.”
“ I know that, and others would be
better off if they followed my example; but
when they have read these remarks, which
you can publish in any way, they can judge
for themselves.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Daniel Leach, of Downie-street, Smedmore,
near Newcastle, in the State of New South Wales,
Commonwealth of Australia, do solemnly and sin-
cerely declare that I have carefully read the
annexed document, consisting of four folios, and
consecutively numbered from one to four, and that
ii contains and is a true and faithful account of nay
illness and cure by Clement. Tonic, and also contains
my full permission to publish in any way m)
statements—which I give voluntarily, without re-
ceiving any payment; and I make this solemn de-
claration conscientiously believing the same to be
true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths
Act, 1900.

WHY WE ADVERTISE!
Because Advertising is the legitimate means vouchsafed to enlighten people,
to acquaint each other with their avocations and wants. If a man has a
Speciality, and has devoted years of his life and expended large sums of money in studying that Speciality and in
purchasing the necessary appliances, etc., for treating certain diseases, it would be absurd for him not to announce
the fact and disseminate the knowledge universally, We have no apology to offer for informing the world through
this advertisement and otherwise of the means of relief we can afford to sufferers who need our help. Therefore,
however opposed to your own preconceived ideas and to those of y r our medical advisers, our method of treatment
may be the fact stili remains that it is successful, and this is verified by the thousands of testimonials received from
grateful patients. We make no secret of our mode of practice. We only claim to have utilised in a common-sense
wav the result of scientific research and long experience. If you listen to the counsel of your sceptical friends and
iealous physician you may omit consulting us, but remember if you allow the disease to run riot in your system, you
are guilty of culpable neglect, and are alone responsible for your future pitiful condition.
Nine Diplomas and Certificates of Qualification and Registration by Government

day passes that the news does not reach us of some wonderful home cure of a person living so far, away that a per-

DO NOT BE DRUGGED TO DEATH BY QUACKS
When there are so many quacks and impudent pretenders in the field of Medicine, who arrogate to themselves
the monstrosity of giving counsel and advice in matters of which they are profoundly ignorant, and who have
nothin"- to recommend them but their audacity, sufferers cannot be too careful whom they consult. Although
libertv'of choice belongs to all, discrimination is necessary. In consulting THE FREEMAN AND WALLACE

of those fitted by superior skill and education, the result of special study. Our reputation and unparalleled
success as Specialists entitle us to your confidence.

“ It is astonishing to see
this little device at work
executing the masterpieces
of pianoforte literature
with a dexterity, clearness,
and velocity which no
player, however great, can
approach. Every one who
wishes to hear absolutely
faultless, free from any

playing should buy a Pi-

Has arrested the attention of the
musical world. Its claims have been
investigated and verified by the great
pianists themselves.
This verification of its claims makes them interesting and
worthy of attention.
h
HE PIANOLA is an instrument by means of which anyone
can play the Piano.
This is accomplished by simply rolling the Pianola in
front of any piano, allowing the felt-covered fingers to rest
upon the keys of the piano, then inserting a roll of perforated paper
into the sockets, and operating the pedals. Playing-directions appear
upon the roll as the music unwinds.
Thus the Pianola provides a substitute for the human fingers and
a correct technique for any piece.
The artistic effects and vivifying personality are given to the ren-
dition by the player, who controls the expression. It is entirely subject
to his will. He may vary the touch from the most delicate pianissimo
to the “ lion’s touch of Rubinstein.”
This human element is the distinctive feature of the Pianola, and
removes it from the ranks of purely mechanic al musical instruments. It
taxes the credulity of all who have rot heard it, but is substantiated by
the fact that the Pianola
is the only Piano = Player

of note.

A Surprise-Party.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bob waa a born leader. Everybody said so. The
fact waa apparent by the way he had always
managed our games of football and cricket, our
boating-parties, our camps at Middle Harbor, and
our midsummer dances at Fern Bay. So we
decided to find some fitting means of recognising
his past services. Jim McGrath ran the move-
ment, and devised a scheme that gave general
satisfaction. We were to give Bob a gigantic
surprise-party—a real surprise-party, not one of
those where the person surprised was found to
have previously removed the sewing-machine,
gipsy-tables, photographs and vases from the
front room, leaving only a few chairs and that old
family relic, the piano.
The party turned-up. There were about thirty
of us, including the ladies. Jim, our captain,
was in high spirits and declared the night a tip-
top one for a dance. No one disputed it.
Promptly at eight o’clock he gave the command,
and we moved en masse down street toward Bob’s
place. Imagine our chagrin upon reaching the
house to find a big “To Let” notice in the
window !
There was no doubt about the place having once
been Bob’s residence —quite ten of the party were
ready to swear to it. Several more swore to give
vent to their feelings; but Jim, I must say, acted
manfully throughout.
“ We won’t be done-in ! ” he declared, and ran
next door to make inquiries. He returned in a
few seconds, beaming. “31 Thomson-street,” he
said, and started off.
We followed, not quite so happy, perhaps, for
Thomson-street was some distance away, and our
baskets were heavy. However, the street was
reached at last, and having located the number,
Jim called a halt.
“’Old on,” said he ; “let’s stand back a bit and
go in by twos and threes, like a procession. ’E’ll
never know when it’s goin’ t’end.”
We hailed his plan with delight, and I went
with him to the door. He was very excited, as
was evident from the way he tugged at the bell.
“Well,” said an old man, opening the door
suddenly; “d’ye want to pull the house down ?”
I felt inclined to say that the house looked
rather like the kind that would fall naturally, but
checked myself.
“Not exactly,” returned Jim. “We want to
know if Bob Walton’s at ’ome.”
“Eh?”—the old man looked very Cross at us.
I concluded he must be either Bob’s grandfather
or a lodger. ,
“We wanter know if Bob’s at ’ome,” Jim re-
peated.
“Eh? I’m a bit deaf; you’ll have to speak
louder.”
He placed his hand behind his ear and leaned
forward.
“We—want—to know—if Bob’s at ’ome,”
yelled Jim.
“ Bob ! Oh, is that it ?—Bob ! ” The old man’s
face softened. “ Oh, no, he’s not in just now.”
“ That’s a pity ! ” observed Jim.
“Eh?”
“ I say—that’s—a—pi—ty.”
“Yes, yes. I —ah—understand.”
“ Will ’e be long ? ” shouted Jim.
“Dunno,” replied the old man. “Went out
with his mother some time ago. I don’t suppose
he’ll be long.”
I looked at Jim and pitied his bad luck. Jim
was apoplectic. “ We’ll wait if you like,” he
bawled in the old man’s ear. But the old man
didn’t ask us in. “Just as you like,” was his
answer.
Jim became desperate. “ See ’ere, ”he shouted,
“ we’re some o’ Bob’s partickler friends, an’ we’re
come to give ’im a little treat: so you might as
well let’s in.”
“ I see,” the old man ejaculated—we turned
and saw the other 28 standing at the gate; they
had become impatient—“lt’s a bit of a surprise-
party, eh ?”
We admitted the fact and were invited inside.
I’ll never forget the look on the old man’s face as
he watched us trying to stow ourselves in the
front room. Fortunately, nothing worse than
folding doors divided us from the dining-room,
and we crowded in there also. We then sugges-
ted removing some of the furniture. The old man
admitted the wisdom of the idea, and we set to
work with a will. The girls removed the photo-
graphs, vases, etc., while we shifted the heavier
things, Jim superintending. Nothing was left in
the big double room but the piano. Before this
our chief pianist seated himself and struck some
startling chords, then launched forth into a waltz,
which soon had the effect of filling the room with
a seething, whirling, twirling mass. It was
grand ! We almost forgot that the object of our
entertainment was missing. Even when we did
think of him we consoled ourselves with the re-
flection that the party would be a genuine surprise
to him. Jim pulled us up at 11.30.
“Time to git supper ready,” said he; “Bob’s
bound to be ’ome soon.”
We carried in the tables belonging to the dining-
room and a couple of others from the kitchen;
also chairs innumerable, not to mention boxes and
shelves. The baskets were unpacked, plates and
dishes piled with cakes or fruit, and for the benefit
of a few teetotallers the old man made coffee. He
seemed to have entered into the spirit of the
thing. I was about to go outside for a smoke and
wait for Bob, when above the laughter and
chatter I heard distinctly a woman’s voice. It
came from somewhere near the front door.
“ Good Heavens ! ” it exclaimed. “ Are we in
the right house ? ”
Now, could there have been a more perfect
surprise-party? Here was a woman made to
doubt if she were in her own house. I heard the
old man’s step in the hall.
“Some o’ Bob’s friends,” he was explaining.
“ Bob’s friends ! ” echoed the lady. “ Did you
toll them to come, Bob ? ”
“ No.” I thought by the sound of his voice
(hat Bob had a cold.
“A bit of a surprise-party,” explained the old
man.
“I should think it was!” said the lady—a
remark that made me feel proud of Jim.
Another moment and she stood in the room, a
young man—a friend of Bob’s, doubtless—stand-
ii g bs3ide her.
“ Here's a pretty mess ! ” she cried. “ Who are
they all?”
Jim came forward and the company settled
itself to listen.
“ Who are they, Bob ? ” she again demanded.
To my surprise, the young man beside her
made answer: “ Can’t say as I know any of ’em.”
“Hasn’t Bob come yet?” Jim inquired.
“Eh? Can’t you see him? Here he is!” the
lady exclaimed.
‘ ‘ No, no ! ” said Jim. “ I mean Bob Walton,”
and I fancied his voice trembled.
" Walton, Walton I'* th© lady rej jeated,
Never heard o’th© name. Our name’s Walker.
Eh 1 W-a-l-k-e-rl”
For a few seconds the silence was awful. Then
our collective name became Walker.
* * * *
We have not yet publioly recognised Bob’s
valuable servioes.
TELSIHC.
The Queen-Bee.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
**Yer gathering ’em in,” said,Larry; “but yer
can’t cop me. I’m the queen-bee, Tommy ! I’m the
queen-bee ! ”
Larry was the chief of a noted gang of horse and
cattle stealers on the Southern line, not far from
the Victorian border, in the late seventies.
Tommy was the sergeant of police in charge of
the neighboring police-station. I was Tommy’s
understrapper, and during the previous year, by a
close attention to the gang’s haunts between
sunset and sunrise, we had succeeded in partly
breaking it up. Larry, however, we could never
catch, and for a merry year or two he had been
responsible for the successful theft of several fine
drafts of horses, and their convevance from
N.S.W. to Queensland.
Larry’s remarks related to the capture (which
we had just effected) of one of the gang, whom
we had caught red-handed operating on an ad-
jacent cookie’s fat steer. We brought him in, and
later on he was duly sentenced to the nearest gaol
for two years.
A month later Larry rode into the barrack-
yard.
“Where’s Tommy?” he asked, excitedly. “I
want a warrant for Dick Danty. He’s mizzled
with my grey mare, and the must be well
on to Mimosa by now.”
Dick Danty was Larry’s first-lieutenant, the
smartest horse-thief of the gang, and as hard to
snap as Larry himself.
I brought Tommy out. Larry laid his infor-
mation, the warrant was issued, and half-an-hour
later we were on Danty’s trail. A two-days’ ride
gave us plenty of time to discuss ways and means
for bringing Larry ultimately to book. It was a
sore point with us, for he took no pains to conceal
his contempt for our efforts, and more than once
he had made us squirm in public by giving a
detailed description of our movements on previous
nights, when, instead of being, as we supposed,
the watchers, we actually turned out to be the
watched.
Four days later we had Danty safely in the
lock-up, and the following day he was committed
to take his trial at the next Circuit Court.
* * * *
“ I had a queer dream last night,” said Tommy
to me one morning about three weeks before the
court was due. “ I dreamt that Larry shook that
grey mare outside, himself. We’ll turn up the
Police Gazette after breakfast.
Accordingly, breakfast over, we worried through
the Gazettes, where, sure enough, we discovered
the identical mare’s description. She was missing
from near S some years previously. A few
inquiries elicited that Larry had been away from
home about that time, and a wire through to the
S man, giving a clear description of the
mare, satisfied us that we had the “ queen-bee ” at
last. We arranged for the secret presence in Y
of the S man and a couple of witnesses, when
the court came on.
* * * *
Court-day. Dick Danty had just been sen-
tenced for stealing the mare from Larry, and
Larry was anxious to regain possession of his
beast, which we had, of course, held till the case
came off.
“Now, Larry,” said Tommy, “does that mare
really belong to you ? ”
“ I’ve sworn to that six times already this morn-
ing,” replied Larry. “ What makes you ask ? ”
“ Beoause I’m going to charge you with stealing
her from ,at S , three years ago, and I
reckon I’ve got the ‘queen-bee’ this trip,” rejoined
Tommy. And we landed Larry into a handy cell.
That afternoon he was taken before the P.M.,
and committed for trial at the court then sitting.’
By noon next day Larry had been tried and sen-
tenced to his 12 months, and I took him up to the
local gaol. Dick Danty was just passing the
inner gate, and had evidently heard the news.
“ What’s he got ? ” he asked.
“Same as yourself, Dick,” I replied, “12
months.”
“ Good for you, old man I I’ll do my stretch on
my blanky head.”
N.S.W.
A.E.W.
Ballarat Chinese have decided to ship all
their paupers, 200 in number, back to China—a
good resolution which other Mongolian colonies
in Australia with a desire for popularity might
imitate.
How Gen. Weyler, the Spanish gentle-
man who set the concentration-camp example in
modern warfare, must chuckle! When it was
Weyler’s work, the British and American press
unanimously denounced the system as barbarous
and unutterably horrible, and the U.S.A. was so
shocked that it went to war on its account. Now
both Britain and U.S.A. have their concentration-
camps—in S’Africa and the Phillipines respec-
tively. As to U.S. official sympathy with Britain
in the S’African war, the fact, of course, is that
both nations being out on a thinly-disguised
mission of plunder neither can afford to criticise 1
the other, as both, in point of motive and methods,
are tarred with the same brush.
If the pomps and vanities of British
militarism are recognised as a fair mark for
ridicule in every country where the haw ! haw !
language of the officah is spoken, what should
German newspapers say about the inane arrogance
of militarism revealed in the recent Blaskowitz
scandal? Lieut. Blaskowitz and Lieut. Hildebrant
were returning to barracks from a supper party,
and the latter, being the less drunk of the pair’
was assisting his gallant comrade to walk straight’.
Therefore Blaskowitz, after the manner of proud
inebriates, smacked his companion on the nose.
It is such an awful thing for one German swash-
buckler to get smitten by another that the colonel
of the regiment summoned a Court of Honor, and
the oourt ordered the two lieutenants to fight a
duel. Practically the colonel and co. were minis-
tering to their own humorless sense of personal
greatness when they ordered the other fellow’s
silly “insult” to be wiped out with blue military
blood. Blaskowitz got killed in the duel, hence
the scandal. The death of either combatant is
calculated to bring duelling into disrepute.


Hot-*
Weather
Worries
ASSITUDE, DEBILITY and “SUMMER FAQ” are always
prevalent ailments after a spell of hot weather. There
is no reason why this should be so if the system is in a
healthy state. To attain this condition it is necessary to
brace up the system, and especially to put the digestive organs
in thorough working order. For this purpose there is no
preparation so effective as BILE BEANS FOR BILIOUSNESS.
Acting in a gentle manner, they do not (as many other
medicines do) achieve a temporary abatement of the trouble
and eventually leave the system weaker than ever. They,
on the contrary, strengthen and build up the whole
digestive system, purify the blood and tone up the nerves.
A course of BILE BEANS will increase your vitality and
enable you to take work and recreation alike with pleasure.

EDWARD EYRE,
A Kero of Australian Exploration.
Thk death of Edward John Eyre, at Walreddon
Manor, Dorset (Eng.), was announced by cable, the
other day. But he had been dead for many years
to Australia —Australia so little mindful of the
heroic exploits of its own soil —and that he was
still alive in 1901 was only discovered by Mr. J. H.
Maiden, of Sydney, on his recent visit to Europe.
Mr. Maiden had a veneration for the lion-hearted
explorer, and, visiting England, inquired as to his
burial place, so that he might visit the tomb. He i
THE LATE EDWARD JOHN EYRE (aged 8 6).
was much astonished to discover that the ex-
plorer was still, at the age of 86, alive and hearty,
in his retirement. A correspondence passed be-
ween them, and at Mr. Maiden’s request Mr. Eyre
had, after some demur, the photograph, printed
herewith, taken. Some of the astonishing vigor
of the man, shown in his exploring feats,
had evidently survived extreme old age, as the
handwriting—a photographic reproduction of
which is printed here—shows little signs of feeble-
ness. The dominant note of Eyre’s character was
courage. He had the courage of his opinions, the
courage to go through with his resolves to the
very jaws of death. He was of the breed of men
who do things, not talk things ; and in a strenuous
career, whilst there may have been many mistakes,
there was never an instance of mean timidity.
His greatest exploit was overlanding from Ade-
laide to Perth.
When this feat was first mooted in 1840, Eyre
was at once suggested as the leader of the
expedition. He had already shown skill and
intrepidity as a bushman, and he knew the
country away to the north of Port Augusta and to
the west of Port Lincoln. Fate seemed to point
to him as the man to open up an overland route
from Adelaide to Perth. The scheme suggested
King George’s Sound as the point of emergence.
Eyre, whilst not considering the plan practicable,
undertook to lead the expedition and to bear one-
third of the expense. In due course a party was
fitted out; it consisted of Eyre himself, E. B.
Scott (an ex-superintendent of Yatala labor
prison), four other whites, and two native boys ;
and took 13 horses, 40 sheep, and three months’
stores. A further supply was to be sent to the
head of Spencer’s Gulf, by sea. The party set
forth on June 18, 1840.
Eyre’s plan of campaign was simplicity itself —-
he decided to follow up the Flinders Range until
it led him to the centre of the continent, and then
strike a bee-line for the Westralian coast. The
outsetting was marked by glowing enthusiasm.
Up to the head of Spencer’s Gulf the country
passed through was delightful. On July 3 a camp
was made at Mount Brown to wait for the supply
vessel, the Waterwitoh. Two days later she
arrived, and, while the stores were being landed,
Eyre made a reconnoitring trip northward, as the
result of which he had to admit that an attempt
to proceed northward by hugging the ranges was
impossible. This preliminary trip took 15 days.
On his return to the depot at Mount Arden,
Eyre sent back the Waterwitoh, and led
his party over barren, stony plains and
dry water-channels, into the arid wildernesses,
hoping to conquer by another route, trending to
the north-west. This also failed, and at Mount
Hopeless the explorer was forced to turn back.
He next determined on a westerly route, and on
Nov. 3, 1840, the expedition concentrated its
forces at Streaky Bay, the base for the next cam-
paign against the desert. After fruitless efforts
to round the Bight there, Eyre decided to reduce
his staff. He sent back to civilisation all but the
overseer, Scott, one other white man, and two
native boys; and he wrote to the Governor asking
for more assistance in the form of provisions and
forage. He waited for these at the depot for
about six weeks, and then made another attempt
to head the Bight, with success this time, reaching
a point 50 miles beyond it. The country was
still desolate, hopeless, sterile, ridged with sand,
flecked here and there with scrub, waterless for
stages of over 60 miles. At the head of the
Bight, Eyre met with some natives, who guided
him to grass and water; but they told him that
no more water would be found for over 100 miles.
The hinterland from the coast was flat and open,
with low, prickly bushes, solanaceous plants, and
patches of gum scrub and grassed spaces.
Eyre knit his brows and clenched his teeth.
Turn back he would not ! His heart would break
in the hour of defeat. But travel onward he
dared not with so large a party. He resolved to
reduce his mouths yet again. Scott and another
of his men were sent back to the settlements.
Baxter (his overseer) and three native black boys
only were retained.
On the 23rd February the reduced party set
forth on a terrible journey. As they were leaving,
1 a cutter brought letters from the Governor urging
Eyre to return. The dogged hero of the desert
point-blank refused, and set forth on his stony
pilgrimage. On 7th March, 1841, Eyre reached
the head of the Bight with a party almost blinded
with sand and tortured with clouds of huge flies.
The water at which they camped was the last of
which they had knowledge. Then Eyre set forth
again, “ travelling very slowly,” with one of the
native boys (Wylie) and the sheep. Baxter, the
overseer, was directed to follow on with the pack-
horses.
On the third day, at noon, Eyre was some 110
miles from his last water, and the sheep could not
move forward an inch. Perforce, he left them
behind, and, with them, a note to Baxter to hurry
on with the horses, whilst he (Eyre) pressed ahead
in search of water. After terrible suffering,
Eyre and his black boy reached the edge of the
cliffs on the 11th of March—but of water there
was none. The baffled and thirst-tortured ex-
plorer pushed on for seven miles in despair,
until a break in the rocks, with sand-drift between,
gave water in plenty. The journey through the
desert had lasted five days, and they had traversed
135 miles. At this oasis the party stayed six days.
Resuming the journey, Eyre, after two days,
struck a grassy patch, but no water could be
found. The stock could not last out another long
stage. The stores were therefore buried, and the
overseer was sent back some 40 miles for
water, while Eyre stayed and guarded the
sheep (now reduced to three). The total quantity
of flour in camp was only 1421b5. When
the overseer returned with fresh water everything
possible was dispensed with, and a sheep was
killed for food. The horses began to fall down
from exhaustion as the journey was pursued ; they
had had no water for five days, and those which
could manage to struggle along followed the men
like dogs. Baxter, the overseer, broke down
utterly, and implored to be allowed to return to
Fowler’s Bay. Eyre was stony to his beseeching.
He determined to conquer, or die in his tracks.
On the 30th of March, and 160 miles from
their last water, Eyre struck the saving fluid at
a depth of five feet in some sandhills.
The horses plucked up spirit, a sheep was killed
for food, and the leader shot a wallaby. Baxter
was sent back from this place for some of the
buried stores. He was absent for 10 days. King
George’s Sound was about 650 miles distant, and
there were provisions only sufficient to last three
weeks, with care. Baxter continued to plead for
permission to return. His chief sternly refused,
though himself fish-poisoned and feeble. A horse
was slaughtered for food, and all the party
sickened from eating of the carcase. Two of the
black boys, however, stole a large quantity of the
meat, and their rations were reduced as a punish-
ment. They deserted the camp. Then the last
sheep was killed, and the dreary tramp resumed.
On the 26th April everything, except pro-
visions, arms, ammunition, and the clothes worn
by the party, was discarded. On the first day 15
miles, on the second day 19 miles were gained.
In the evening the horses were hobbled and turned
out to feed. They strayed away, and between 10
and 11 o’clock Eyre went out to look for them.
Coming back he heard the report of a gun, and
reaching camp found the faithful Baxter shot
through the chest. The murderers were the two
black boys who had deserted. Baxter expired in
Eyre’s arms. All the weapons and most of the
stores had disappeared. The next morning
Baxter’s body was wrapped in a blanket and
covered with leaves—all that was possible, since
the earth was as iron. The provisions left in the
camp by the thieves amounted to about 401 b. of
flour, four gallons of water, and a little tea and
sugar.
Still not daunted, Eyre plunged forward on his
tramo of some 600 miles, moving at the rate of
about 10 miles a day, with frequent rests to hus-
band his strength. The two disaffected blacks
followed in his track, trying to entice Wylie
away. Then they, too, faded into the blur of the
rear, probably perishing in the hungry desert.
The horses had had no water for five days ; 150
miles of rocky tableland had been traversed
without a single drink. On the 2nd May a native
well was found and the horses heartened some-
what. Eight days’ rest, and a horse was
slaughtered for food and his flesh dried —then
once more on the track ! From this point the
country improved, and water was easily obtained ;
but Eyre and Wylie were deadly sick from the
effects of eating diseased horse meat. They could
do no better than crawl forward. One day a
native dog carried off some fourteen pounds of
their rotten food, and the outlook was black
indeed. But a day later grassed country was
struck, and Eyre shot a kangaroo. On the 19th
May only four miles were made, but water and
grass were found, so Eyre and his black boy
rested and refreshed for six days, feeding on kan-
garoos, fish and crabs.
Once again the sturdy-hearted tramps resumed
their treadmill path to victory. On May 26 water
was obtainable, but of game there was none. By-
and-by the travellers were reduced to a few
spoonfuls of flour and water. Some reeds
and roots were greedily chewed. Eyre and
Wylie now indeed lived upon anything that
crept or grew. After an aeon of hideous
suffering, the poor wretches made the sea, and
there, to their joy unutterable, rode at anchor a
barque. It was a French whaler, the Mississippi,
commanded by Captain Rossiter—after whom
Eyre gratefully designated the bay. A boat put
off and took the wayfarers on board. There for
some time they rested. With new clothes and
fresh provisions, they once more faced the desert,
and in 12 days reached Cape Barren, 150 miles
from Rossiter Bay. On 7th July they reached
Albany, and Eyre had won.
The biggest cargo ever taken from Aus-
tralia to England is that of the Suevic on her
current voyage. It includes 21,518 bales of wool
and 74,000 frozen sheep.
What the mercantile marine is coming to.
Capt. Salter, of the barque Ancenis, lately arrived
in Hobson’s Bay, reported that on leaving New
York he found that of the “ able seamen” supplied
him by the boarding-master, eight were capable
men, but of the others one had never seen a ship
before, another was an artist who had no
knowledge of the duties, the third was a machinist,
the fourth an actor, the fifth and sixth were
soldiers, and last of all came a cowboy.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
“I am a professional cyclist.”
“In training and racing in the extreme heat of a Queensland summer, which
requires a heavy expenditure of nervous energy and often leaves one thoroughly
exhausted, I have found Ayer’s Sarsaparilla of the greatest benefit.
“It makes you have a good appetite, tones up the stomach, steadies the
nerves, and puts the ‘go’ into you. I tell you, lam a great friend to Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla.” , , „,
Mr. F. E. Shaw, of Edward St.', Brisbane, Queensland, a cyclist well known m
connection with the “Red Bird Bicycle,” sends us this letter together with a
photograph from which the above illustration is made. This is another reason
why Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is called
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Such a testimonial shows how valuable Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is to those who
have to work hard. It removes all feeling of exhaustion, braces you up, makes
your work easier, gives strength to the muscles, refreshes and invigorates, and)
best of all, takes out every impurity from the blood.
