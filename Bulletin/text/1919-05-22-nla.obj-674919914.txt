easy to take and pleasant in their
action. They are not drastic,
although certain and thorough.
Pinkettes are designed to

AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from Indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes correct acidity.of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent abnormal
fermentation of the food, thus allowing the
natural digestive ferments to act, and if
taken regularly after meals they so improve
the digestion that a strict diet becomes
unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol Juj'ubes
are most useful to those who suffer from
Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

Blank Verse
A line of ten syllables alternately accente
and unaccented was used by Chaucer wit
grace and ease for his narrative verse, whiel
in its class, holds almost top place in Eng
lisli to-day. Chancer used rhyme and used
well; but it remained for the experimenter
of a later age to discover that the essentia
qualities of the line he used were there witl
or without the rhyming endings. Old
Saxon verse and the earliest Middle Englisl
attempts were rhymeless and without accu
rate scansion, depending on a rather heavy
weight alliteration to give the matter
hoarse, singing quality different from prose
Among scholars, the Greek and Latin rhyme
less verse with accurate quantitative scansion
was maintained to be superior to anything
attempted in English; but these scholars
continued right up to the seventeenth am
eighteenth centuries to write their verses in
Latin; arid by doing so they found, whm
they probably deserved, an audience of none
Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, in the reign
•of Henry VIII. began trying experiments
He had the instinct for the classical forms,
the remembrance of the Saxon alliterative
method and the rhyming ten-syllable line
to guide him; and dipping deep down into
the very soul of the language he brought
forth blank verse. In other words, he cut
the rhymes away from the line used by
Chaucer, and gaining freedom from restraint
by that cutting, discovered a full, musical
rhythm, which has served as the medium for
much of England’s best poetical thought.
There is only one blank verse. No other
length or shape of line has been discovered
that even approaches it for strength and
melody; but the one line lias become a
thousand in the mouths of a thousand
singers. So flexible is it that it throbs and
quivers to each poet’s thought in a wholly
distinct marfher, yet preserves through all
its simple form unchanged. Some have
used it very loosely with many elided
syllables; others tightly and firmly, with a
scansion that is almost quantitative; others,
again, with a certain disregard for the exact
accent here and there; but always there is
the same marching movement.
Take a few striking examples of the dif-
ferent modes of handling. Hear the voice
of John Milton :
Abject and lost luy these, covering the flood,
: Under amazement of their hideous change.
so loud that all the hollow deep
Ot Hell resounded: “Princes, potentates,
Warriors, the Flower of Heaven—once yours; now
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal Spirits?’
There is the oeean-like roll of sound in that,
which is characteristic of the singer, though
many a more sonorous passage could easily
he found. Now hear William Wordsworth
take up the same metre:
Loving she is and tractable, though wild ;
And innocence hath privilege in her
To dignify arch looks and laughing eyes;
And feats of cunning; and the pretty round
Of trespasses, affected to provoke
Mock-chastisement and partnership in play'.
Again, hear Shelley’s use of the medium :
There was a poet whose untimely tomb
No human hand with pious reverence reared,
But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds
Built o’er his mouldering bones a pyramid
Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness.
And now Keats:
We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs
Have bred forth, not pale solitary' doves,
But eagles golden-feathered, who do tower
Above us in their beauty, and must reign
In right thereof ; for ’tis the eternal law
That first in beauty should be first in might.
And now, strangest of all, Tennyson uses
the same form in a lyric:
All, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds
To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.
What reader, casually meeting the five
examples of blank verse quoted, would take
them to be built on the same plan, scanning
in the same manner and with only the var-
iety to be obtained by choice of "word and
plirasd? Yet the list of quotations might
be indefinitely extended and always the form
would | )e found shaping itself to the poet’s
individuality. Blank verse is not an
arbitrary thing, but something inherent in
the language. A oices rising in pleading, in
anger or under stress of any great emotion
almost naturally fall into its rhythm and
neat. Henry Howard, whose head Henry
j.°r chopped off, stumbled on a wonderful

Tredick
I redick lies between the 70th and 125th
degrees of longitude W. and, in a general
v ay, it is south of Canada and north of
rwnvni-A" f sho . rt > Tredick is any place
-I d by a little black dot on the map
ot .J" e U-S.A. And Freeman Tilden, who
writes Khaki (The Macmillan Co., N’York),
nvod in Tredick; and that makes this his-
tory of how Tredick got into the war, and
how it felt before it got there, something of
a contribution to international history.
To begin with:
I h("'° was a shadowy consciousness that somehow
Bonn ere, the United States had fallen into ar
iionc able debt to France, and had never quite settled
up. But the overwhelming feeling was, after the
war had gone past its second month, and nobody
stopped it, and after it had gone by its third month,
and nobody stopped it, that the war was a terrible
mistake on somebody’s part, and that somebody
should stop it.... Tredick said to Europe in its
heart: “Don’t be foolish. But if you must be
foolish, don’t disturb Tredick.”.... Tredick is part
Of the United States, and is proud of it. The rest
of the world is a queer place, and, though it has
interesting cathedrals and ruins, you never can tell
what may happen there. There was a huge satis-
faction in Tredick that it was not part of that
world, out there, where such disgraceful goings-on
were going on.
Then the Lusitania was sunk; and the
world, out there, wondered why the United
States didn’t “come in.” The historian of
Tredick explains it:—
The news that a great ship, loaded with men,
women and children—not soldiers—had been shat-
tcred on the great ocean, and left to its fate, sent a
sickening shudder through Tredick. This was war,
then. This was war? “If that is war,’’ said Tre-
dick, “we want none of it!’’
‘‘Yes,” it heard the queer place which is the
outer world say, “but these were American
citizens.” Tredick ' said, questioningly at
first, they were warned not to travel on that
ship. Then Tredick said in a louder voice
"What right have a few stubborn people t
drag us into war?” War is a terrible thing
it told itself; and then it said, very loudly
“What right have a few stubborn people t
drag us into this terrible war?”
After that, the President began writing
Notes.
“lie had better be careful,” said Tredick. “Wa
18 a terrible tiling. We are so liappy as we are
See Tredick—how peaceful it i 5.... You would no
send such fine boys to war, would you? Who starte
this war, anyway? Kings and gun-manufacturers
And voa want to drag Tredick into it!’’
The President went on writing Notes, unti
Tredick felt that it ought to put itself it
order. So it met in Perkins Hall and
adopted a Declaration of Peace:—
W hekeas most of the countries of Europe ar
involved in a bloody and terrible war, which we
believe to have been avoidable but for the ms china
tions of kings and militarists and the sowing o:
seeds of hate among various peoples ; and
W hereas the danger of the United States being
drawn into this conflict seems to grow greater even
day, with each new event; and
Whereas we, the people of Tredick, in mass meet-
ing’ assembled, believe it to be the duty of the
United States, to its own citizens and the cause o 1
Universal Brotherhood, not to become involved in
this war. Therefore be, it
Resoiwed that it. is the spirit of this meeting thal
our country should be kept out of the War at all
costs, even at the expense of foregoing any and all
rights we may have as a sovereign people (inas-
much as we can assume these rights again after the
war), and that we do nothing from this time forth
that could possibly bring us into conflict with any
foreign country, and that we propose our willingness
to submit any question to arbitration.
There was one dissentient, and, after saying
what she thought of it all, she strode out.
Prof. George W. Wenliam had the resolution
in hand. He begged the meeting to forgive
the hysterical sister. “The purpose of this
meeting,” said the Professor, “is to pass
resolutions of peace. Do you want war or
do you want peace? Now is the time to
speak. Are you going to declare for blood-
shed, or for the white dove of brotherhood?”
And not a hand went up against it.
That was the second day of April, 1917
three years, nearly, after the war had
started. And then Tredick woke up next
morning to find that the United States' had
declared war against Germany! Tredick
had been too late. So Tredick said: “We
thought peace best, but our President has
spoken for war. We are Americans. We
obey our superiors. Woe to the enemy! Let
the enemy beware of America’s legions!”
It did not occur to Tredick that America had no
legions—that America’s legions were yet on paper,
as were her guns, and her merchant ships and nearly
everything else that was necessary to carry woe to
any enemy.... “There’ll be something coming to the
Germans,” said Wells Hardy, coming down to his
Cash Market. And then Wells Hardy immersed him-
self in the problem of how to collect a bill from a
person who really had no money. And Harry Upton
said, with great enthusiasm : “Wait till America gets
going. She’ll show ’em.” And therefore, confident
that America would take care of everything, Harry
devoted all his time to buying hides to store against
higher prices.
There is a great deal more in this book,
written from Chester (Mass.) ; indeed, all
that lias been printed above is only inci-
dental to the story, which is an excellent
one regarded as a story. And it all winds
up in this way (the war wasn’t then over) :
And we know now that Khaki is no mere color and
weave, but a living, precious thing. It is the symbol
of Service, which is Life itself. Whosoever” shall
wear Khaki, in mind or on the body, cannot die, for
he is wedded to that which cannot die. It is the
very spirit of that selflessness which “conquers death,
strips it of fear, and makes it almost beloved.”
Which, somehow, sounds just like the Fourth
of July.
We like Tredick, and we are obliged to
Freeman Tilden for writing this chapter of
its history. It makes it easier to understand
a lot of things—including the numerous atti-
tudes of Professor Woodrow Wilson.
’Flu and After
I could feel a chill at the onset of it
as old Job might liaye done when ’flu came
to him suddenly, so that he said: “A wind
passed before my face and the hair of my
flesh stood up.” It hit me just like
that—a little breeze with death in it at 10
o’clock at niglit. that worked while I slept
and made me weak as water by the morning.
Remember that story of the sudden visitation
that wiped out the first-born of the Egyp-
tians and left the Jews free to leave Egypt
and begin their long career of pawnbroking?
Just as sudden and decisive as that; and I
lay agonising from head to foot, comforting
myself with the belief that it was only the
old breakbone fever back again, and that it
would ease up on the third day. And the
third day I was almost too weak to feel
pain. A weakness as if bones had turnec
to water, but could not flow away, because
the skin was sealed, and would not let the
water evaporate. You began to understand
the distorted idea of theologians of Hell
after death —the adapted experience of a
man in fever playing the human casserole
or, rather, his skin being like baked paper,
feeling as if he were suffering cooking in a
paper bag. And then weakness and again
weakness—palliated by friends and the kind-
est of volunteer nurses; palliated by light
and cleanliness and care, so that a man had
to think of the poor bearing this disease that
has for its friend a bad landlordism and
overcrowding and ill-nutrition and all the
horror of the slums.
In ship cases the passenger has been prac-
tically immune, where the firemen, and more
the steward —who does not sit down to
meals, but, half-exhausted with bad air. eats
standing up at the pantry—have provided
most of the cases and the deaths. So mak-
ing those resolutions which the possessor of
a portable hell may be trusted to make, the
thinking man promises himself that his re-
covery shall see an attack with a big stick
on overcrowding in shins and cities. I had
to bear modified ’flu with care and light and
cleanliness that prevented its- worst develop-
ment : and therefore I had to think of three
sick in a room in Surry Hills dependent

Memories.
Autumn wind on the land
And brown leaves drifting ;
And the great trees where they stand
Sobbing and lilting
To the first clatter of rain
On a diiu, old window-pane.
There is a long thought
At my still heart sipping
That a young soul caught
From thatched eaves dripping
As the evening fell chill
Over the field and the hill.
Autumns and autumns gone by!
The years are a dying feather;
And my heart goes out with a cry
To the old, grey weather.
Autumn and Autumn again;
And the wind will bring the rain !
April holds in its heart
The dusk of an old November;
And, gazing long and apart,
I remember, I remember—-
God, what a thought awoke
At the smell of the bog-turf smoke!

"O Love divine!” the lover sings,
Quite pleased with his unhappy state;
Emotion all his spirit wrings
And every pang is dedicate
To that sweet creature kindly fate
Has sent to guide his soul above.
But when these wild spring tides abate—
Well, Habit is akin to Love.
Dan Cupid has his little flings,
And then, because he’d simply hate
To fly away, he moults his wings
And pads the hoof with sober gait.
No more the lover to his mate
Speeds on swift wings like Dante’s dove
But still he comes, at any rate,
For Habit is akin to Love.
Old custom, like the ivy, clings,
A circumstance most fortunate;
No flash of dazzling bliss it brings,
Nathless it keeps one fairly straight.
What though delight be out of date,
Still Habit gives a gentle shove,
And he shall come and she shall wait,
For Habit is akin to Love.
Envoy :
Fair dames, be not disconsolate:
Trust the aforesaid gentle shore.
Though Hymen’s scarce insatiate.
Yet Habit is akin to Love.

Blithesomeness.
Turn aside from the highway,
Go where your fancy pleases,
Take the track of the swallows.
Follow the way of the breezes,
Yield to the mood of the moment,
Be as a grass-seed or feather
Now at the will of the wind upswirled,
And now at rest on the heather.
That’s the way, and the only way,
To shut care out of your heart, I say,
And lose yourself to the noisy world.
Throw yourself on the bracken,
Nestle deep in its frondage,
Thinking not of the morrow—
Nay, nor the morrow’s bondage.
Open your ears to the anthem
Harped by the easeful ocean;
Glad it is of the tide and wind,
Glad of its rhythmical motion.
That’s the way, and the only way.
To shut care out of your heart, I say,
And leave the woes of the world behind.
Hearken the thrushes above you,
Song without sadness outpouring,
Caring no whit for the brown hawk
Lazily, lazily soaring;
Deep in the shade of the sheoak,
Peep at the sea through their veiling,
Seeing at times a gull on the blue,
And at others a far ship sailing.
That’s the way, and the only way,
To shut care out of your heart, I say,
And live the life that is best for you.
Cool of the feathery bracken,
Glory of grass and blossom.
Grace of the swaying gum-trees,
Strength of the good earth’s bosom—
Things not sold in the market.
Pawed till their prime be over—
Spoil of the wild, and glorious spoil;
They fall to the lot of the rover.
Gay, oh gay, is the world, I say,
When Jack and Jill on a golden day
Forget the worries of care and toil.

A CAPITAL IN THE TROPICS.
The Japanese has lots of patience like his
Chinese neighbor, as well as much ambition
and organising capacity. He may have
been defeated for the moment in his demand
for the free admission of his people to Aus-
tralia, Maoriland, Canada and the United
States, where they want to go because there
is room, as well as in his request for access
to other League territories where they don’t
much care about going because there isn’t
room, though the demand is made as a
matter of dignity. But the Japanese people
can wait. They have time to spare. A
nation which claims that its present dynasty
has lasted 2579 years, and which expects it
to last 257,999 years more, isn’t pressed for
a minute or two. It is clearly intimated
that, though nothing has been done so far,
Nippon abates no whit of its claim, and
expects to succeed later on. That is to
say, when trouble arises and its support is
so badly needed that it will command a
price, this may be its price. As a big
member of the League of Nations, always
watching its opportunity at the Council
table, it will be in a vastly better position
than as a disgruntled absentee crying at the
keyhole like a lost wind in a desert. In
this matter Australia has very few friends
and it may have fewer. Britain, which
ought to know a great deal about color
problems, being the head of an empire which
is more than three-fourths colored, seems un-
able to understand the matter on either the
industrial or the racial side. It makes
polite allowances for the incomprehensible
Australian, who is in unusual favor just
now because his great deeds in the war
haven't had time to fade, and because the
crowd which wants to repudiate the Public
Debt hasn’t got into power yet. So the
time hasn’t arrived for putting in a receiver
after the fashion of Egypt. But its atti-
tude is really one of tolerance—perhaps
temporary tolerance unless Australia shows
better cause to the contrary. On the eco-
nomic side of the matter Britain’s position
is insular but understandable. It still has
Freetrade leanings. It is very far away
from cheap-labor competition, and until 1914
it had cheap labor of its own to meet com-
petition with. The colored artisan can’t
come and set up in England, for England,
the predominant partner, is twice as crowded
as Japan.. And as regards the racial
view
No nation should know better than the
British that all the pomp and pride of the
most arrogant conquering nation that was
ever invented can’t prevent the admixture of
blood when white and colored live together.
The British population in India numbers
only about 100,000, or one in 3000. They
are practically all creatures of passage who
intend to go back to a country where an off-
color wife and tinted children are practically
impossible. They are a tiny caste hemmed
in by caste prejudices as well as racial in-
stincts. let they have created a mixed com-
munity of some size. The tint doesn’t trouble
the white parents so very much because they
can go home to Europe and leave it, but it
would be a supreme annoyance if India was
their home as Australia is ours and they
had to stay with it. In like manner the
United States has its mulatto and quadroon
population, though it is less mixed than the
countries south of it. There were free
mulattos even in the slave days—free be-
cause freedom or servitude was fixed accord-
ing to the status of the mother, and the
mothers were white and free. The negro
was far lower intellectually than the Hindu
or Chinaman and incomparably lower than
the Japanese, and he was not only black and
ugly—he was a chattel the same as a dog.
Yet the women of the proudest white caste
on earth cohabited with him at times. To
prevent the admixture of blood when white
and colored races live permanently together
is impossible, and it is equally impossible
to prevent the colored race swamping the
white one if it is strong and brainy like
the Japanese, and is in a majority as the
Japanese might be in empty Australia.
Pietists and brotherhood-of-man theorists
say that we shouldn’t recognise any dif-
ference between ourselves and the colored
brother who may be mentally our equal.
Perhaps we shouldn’t. Therefore, as a sport-
ing offer, Australia might agree to reconsider
its position when the unveiled contempt for
the half-breed, the mulatto and the Eurasian
vanishes automatically out of English litera-
ture ; when the white race in India drops its
exclusiveness and forgets that such exclu-
siveness ever existed; and when an heir to
the British throne takes to himself an Indian
or Japanese wife without any national pro-
test and as a matter of course. In both
these Asiatic countries the better classes are
ot very high intelligence. They can show
families to choose from as royal and as
ancient as that of Britain. And an Indian
niarnage would surely be a matter of policy
and a compliment to a country which stands
for two-thirds of the population of the
empire. If such a thing is a thought to be
thrown aside, then Australia’s position re-
quires no explanation.
* * * *
All the same, Australia’s position will
have to be defended, seeing that Japan’s
demand is still in existence and may become
active under much w orse circumstances for
us. And don’t let us make any mistake about
if there is not too much of either physical
or moral force at the back of the defence.
Australia stands for the only race which has
had a chance, so far as history shows, to
establish a pure-white settlement in the
tropics; in every other case the colored per-
son already on the spot has been too multi-
tudinous. It is the only race which declares
that the existence of a pure white race in
the tropics is. not only possible but desirable.
The old British section which judges every-
thing by the standards of India and Jamaica
and Sierra Leone is apt to reply that the
fad is exploded and calls for no imperial
support or encouragement. The north of
Australia is declared to be empty. To a
great extent it is declared to b«* so because
of the way it is governed. Part of it is
run as a sort of Crown cidony or fofp’Vn
possession. The rest is divided into appan-
ages of two States which have their seais of
government in the temperate south—one of
them almost as far south as is possible with-
out falling overboard. There is no tropical
State, though the 359,000 square miles of
(Queensland above Capricorn would make
two fairly respectable ones both for area and
population. Each would be twice the size
of Victoria, seven times the size of Tas-
mania, and twice the habitable area of S.
Australia. And there is no reason why
everything above latitude 25 should not be
tacked on to the nearest tropical capital to
make a better show. Something of the
ort misht be done with the northern
400.000 square miles of Westralia. There
isn t even an Excellency in the north since
(jlLßuttt fled, and not only is there no Par-
liamentary capital there but there isn’t one
within 250 miles of Capricorn. It is
absurd to make it a leading plank of our
Fi? b *te Australia is possible in
the North if not one White Australian Gov-
ernment in the whole seven will live there
itself.
OLD REMNANTS IN A NEW WORLD.
More and more State politics in N. S. Wales
develop into a curious scuffle over issues
which have nothing to do with the State, or
with State politics. In Paddington there is
a by-election which is being fought by two
soldiers, representing Holman and Car-
michael respectively, and one civilian who
calls himself a Laborite. The soldier who is
battling to keep Holman in his job rests his
case on the alleged tremendous things the
National crowd has done for the soldiers.
Carmichael’s man relies on the things his
leader is going to do for soldiers if Holman
is only oufed. The Laborite, one O’Hara—
to his friends, “Fighting Larry”— asks for
supnort on the grounds that he has no sym-
pathy with the soldiers or with the war. and
that, if returned, he will oppose nreferential
treatment of the military. The Nationalists
have introduced the further issue that
Fighting Larry” is a Roman Catholic. It
is no more the State’s business to attend to
a S x wrongs of returned members
of the A.I.F. than it was its business the
itlier day to take the Quarantine administra-
tion out of the Australian Government’s
hands. As in the Quarantine matter, so on
military issues, confusion, ill-feeling and
duplication of effort can be the only result of
State interference. Mr. O’Hara may get
votes by stressing the fury of his pacifism
in the days when the best blood of Australia
was being poured out for the lack of rein-
forcements. But, anyhow, it has no relation
to State politics.
None of the candidates has come forward
definitely, so far, with one big, clear-cut pro-
position which has to do essentially with
N. S. Wales. Not one, for example, has com-
mitted himself and his party to the imme-
diate abolition of the office of State Gover-
nor. The State has been promised this relief
by generations of politicians. Hardly any
one wants the anachronism continued. It is
ruinously expensive, at a time when Aus-
tralia has incurred a debt of £332,000,000. If
the State Governor and his entourage made
a practice of entertaining Bolsheviks, 0.8. U.
propagandists, Domain orators and recently-
naturalised Germans, there .might be some-
thing in the claim that their presence here
strengthens the bonds of Empire. But the
only ones who go to Government House are
those whose attachment to the established
order requires no reinforcement. In any
case, periodical doles of sandwiches and
claret cup are to way to strengthen the
silken bonds. The very State Governors
themselves are beginning to realise it. The
job has been a sinecure ever since Federa-
tion. But till the war woke the world, the
average citizen didn’t see it so clearly. State
Governors still remained public personalities ;
they even ventured, occasionally, to assert
themselves politically. If, at this time of
day, a State Governor was so rash as to do
anything more than draw his salary, and in
return indulge in a little harmless' Society
entertaining, it would be his finish.
# + * *
The reason why State politicians, regard-
less of what labels they attach to themselves,
assail the State Governorship either not at
all _or very tenderly, is that his Ex.’s
position bears a strong resemblance to
their own. Like him they are super-
fluities. Like him they are every year
costing the taxpayers thousands of pounds
sterling, which should go in reduction
of our foreign debt. He justifies his job
v People to dipe and play tennis;
they try to do it by pointing out what they
have, or have not, done for the A.I.F. —the
attention of the public being centred on that
issue at present. Every one of the State
Governors duties could be performed—as
aiT u have been in the Past—by a Judge.
AH the work which at present calls for the
upkeep of two State Houses, a horde of
domestics, a fleet of motor-cars and sundries,
could be done by a drab business body on the
lines of the London County Council. With
the arrival of unification the idiotic pagean-
try which still survives, to the satisfaction of
none but those who are making their livings
out of it, will go. Meantime, all hands
struggle gallantly to justify themselves, and
make but a poor success of it.
LABOR CONFERENCE FINANCE.
Victoria’s Labor Conference was lately in
session carrying resolutions which, if en-
dorsed by the Federal Conference later on,
will become part of the Labor policy of Aus-
tralia. Some few of them are admirable;
the majority of them are curiously futile and
indefinite. In the former category is the
abolition of Upper Houses, so far at least
as it refers to State Legislatures, though this
has been on the programme for a long, long
\Hiile, and every time Labor has been in
office it has treated the plank with scorn,
just as it has done its economy plank and
the one about rhe abolition of State
Governors, But if the proposal is in-
tended to apply to the Federal Par-
nament it would probably mean the
finish of the Commonwealth, for the
uni-cameral system would mean that the
eighth part of Australia would own the
whole power, and if it ran things in the
usual parochial fashion the other seven-
eighths mieht remain pretty empty till the
crack of doom. The initiative and referen-
dum idea and the proposal to subdivide Aus-
tralia into smaller States are wholly com-
mendable, and there the stock of big good
inspirations practically ran out. On the
financial and industrial side the Conference
was crude and amateurish as usual, though
it had sense enough to drop the crazy idea
it r ®P u<^ia ting the public debt and breaking
all. the savings banks and life assurance
societies in one great act. Some of its con-
clusions were as follows:

Altogether an interesting collection.
As regards the first, something like 95 per
cent, of Australian life assurance is run by
co-operative institutions, paying no dividends
to capitalists, admitting every applicant on
equal terms, and managing their affairs very
successfully on a strictly democratic basis.
Ihe only ways by which these institutions
could be “nationalised” more than they are
would be by allowing nominees or non-sub-
scribers to handle the cash—people who
don t care to insure or who are too diseased
or too mad to be admitted—and by allowing
politicians to appoint each other to the best
billets regardless of qualifications. Cer-
tainly the proprietary fire-insurance concerns
might be either bought up or stolen—barring
the zG or so that are foreign-owned, and
which do most of the business of the Com-
monwealth. Or, but for the hatred of creat-
in'” instead of annexing things, a Federal
Department land possibly separate State De-
partments) might be formed, and the private
concerns be allowed a stated time in which
to wind up and retire. Such a concern
should be vastly profitable if run on the
lines of the Commonwealth Bank, and not
made a home for decayed or hustling poli-
ticians; but there is a great lack of detail
in the Conference proposals, and the possi-
bilities of the home-for-politicians idea loom
very large. The taking over of the banks
should be qualified by recognition of the
facts that there are five very robust banks
which, being owned abroad, can’t be annexed
in any high-handed fashion without risk of
Sydney and Melbourne being bombarded, and
that the biggest bank can’t be nationalised
because it is the people’s property already.
The proposal to nationalise shipping is
tempered by the drawback that there is
mighty little privately-owned Australian
shipping left to nationalise, and if it was
proposed to seize what little there is without
compensation it would probably fly to foreign
ports while the Ship Seizing Bill was being
passed. The Government owns a few out-of-
date vessels bought with borrowed money, and
it had a purpose to build 48 ships locally,
and thus nationalise on a big scale. But
the building of 24 ships was abandoned, and
22 more haven’t eventuated yet. The Labor
party showed no strenuous interest in the
scheme, or in any other scheme for doing
things as distinct from “taking over” the
things that other people have done. The
decision that “none of the gold in the
Treasury shall be handed to private banks”
was probably devised by the Conference
office-boy. No Treasury gold is “handed”
to private banks except when they want cash
for Government notes, and if the Govern-
ment isn’t ready to hand out gold in place
of its notes then they cease to be of any
account, and 50 of them won’t buy a loaf.
As for the speedy repayment of war loans,
nothing could be more honest and commend-
able than the repayment of all loans and any
kind of loans, provided no gang of wretched
financiers is borrowing as fast or three times
as fast as it repays. Obviously the first
thing is to stop the increase of debt —i.e.,
to stop borrowing—and then to tackle the
reduction of debt. It is a gradual process
ot patient endeavor and honesty and in-
dustry, and it can’t be done by any spas-
modic or heroic levy on “land and capital,”
especially if there are to be exemptions. The
foreign creditor won’t take small hen allot-
ments or wheat farms on which returned
soldiers can’t live except with the aid of
“sustenance money” in exchange for his
securities. Nor will he take leasehold squat-
tages with, rabbits and cactus on them, and
if he did it would only be making him an
absentee landlord. There probably isn’t
enough private realisable wealth —not squat-
ters’ leaseholds and rabbits—in large lumps
in Australia and belonging to Australians
to make a perceptible dent in the war debt.
The banking and savings bank and life
assurance totals look big, but they are made
ud of everybody’s money. The capital goes
out—£7o,ooo,ooo of it or more in a year—
to pay for imported clothes and interest on
imported debts and such-like, and until plain
local industry puts some sort of plug into
that leak there is nothing heroic to be
done.

In all the schemes devised by the Mel-
bourne Labor Conference for the regenera-
tion of Australia there wasn’t a single men-
tion of. achieving more work; of keeping the
well-paid industries to ourselves, instead of
being wharf-lumpers and beasts of burden;
of having our artisans here instead of in
England, the U.S. and Japan, so that the
debt burden, would be halved by doubling
the population; or of ceasing to sell the
country to absentee capitalists by floating
foreign loans for “development.” All the
talk was of “taking over” something or
stealing something or nationalising some-
thing that already exists. The Conference
called itself “Labor,” but for the foregoing
reasons it sounded more like Loafer.
ON THE VERGE OF THE PIT.
It was not only to get butter on its bread
again that Westralia welcomed with deep
relief the end of the trouble over the unload-
ing of the Dimboola at Fremantle. The com-
munity had had something more than a hint
of the meaning of Bolshevism, and its nerves
are still on the quiver. The alleged danger
of flumonia was the hollowest pretext for
the refusal of the old lumpers to either
touch the Dimboola themselves or permit a
“National” gang to handle her cargo. The
truth was that they had had enough of
scrambling for a bone from which most of
the meat had been stripped by the shipping
cos.’ protegees, and the ’flu seemed a good
card to play for a start. The public suf-
fered uncomplainingly for a time, but after
a week or so of dripping instead of butter
and preserved eggs without bacon, there were
loud yells for Colebatcii to do something.
The outcome was a triangular game between
the Government, the local shipping bosses
and the Federal Controller, who was having
his butter as usual and didn’t care a damn.
A Trades Hall disputes committee took over
the lumpers’ fight and every “Nationalist”
w'orker was chased to the horizon. The
Nationalists live out of Fremantle—for
health reasons—and as they don’t buy the
local beer and slop-made clothes, the Fre-
mantle bung and shopkeeper have always
regarded _ them with sour disfavor. Com-
mercial interests at the port took the side
of the old lumper, while Perth consignees
and non-laborites generally demanded that
the loyalists, who came to the country’s aid
in 1917, when the old lumpers refused to load
an oversea ship, should be given such pro-
tection as would allow them to unload the
Dimboola. Colebatch spent three weeks
in inaction ; then, when he decided to make
a move, he naturally found the industrial
forces solidly organised. The twins I.W.W.
and Bolshevism had been putting in strong
work until it was almost hazardous to wear
an air of respectability in the Fremantle
streets
Having resolved that the “Nationals” were
to work the ship, Colebatch called up
a volunteer party to barricade the wharf
on the Sunday morning. He obviously
had not the slightest idea of what he
was up against. He rallied a crowd
of right-thinking citizens—commercial trav-


ellers and others —to lend the baiu-
caders moral support; and down the river
thev went in launches, with hampers aboard,
in blithe holiday spirits. The picnic aspect
of the jaunt began to fade when the launches
ran the gauntlet of a fusillade of iron bars
and boulders from the two bridges which
span the stream before the harbor is reached.
The enemy’s scouts had been at work, and
when the party climbed on to the wharf
there was a growling, menacing and rapidly-
growing mob on the other side of a flimsy
temporary barrier. It looked as if Cole-
batch and his party were to be the chief
joints of the picnic luncheon. About 125
police, armed with batons, stood between
them and over 2000 men and women who
were seeing red and throwing blue metal.
After a fluctuating battle, with casualties on
both sides, it was seen that only ball cart-
ridge could save the police, Premier Cole-
batch and his party from being swept into
the river. So the Riot Act was read ; and
then Colebatch weakened on the logical
sequel. lie suggested an armistice, which
General McCallum granted. It was only the
great personal influence which this Trades
Hall chieftain can exercise over liis crowd
that saved_ the clash from culminating into
the ugliest affair Australian industrial-
ism has known, and Colebatch had to
undertake to withdraw the police altogether
from the wharves in order to get for his
following safe conduct back by the way they
had come.
From that moment Fremantle belonged
wholly to the mob. It was spread abroad
(quite without truth) that a man bayoneted
by a policeman guarding vital communica-
tions was a returned soldier; whereupon a
gang of hooligans, alleged to be returned sol-
diers, too, commenced to wage a vendetta
against the “force.” On the following day a
single policeman was attacked by about 200,
knocked down and kicked as he lay. He
was rescued by a few comrades, who were
forced to make a feint with their revolvers.
Six policemen were injured more or less seri-
ously, and when night came the authorities
were forced to withdraw every man from
the streets. It is no exaggeration to say
that a lone John Hop on his beat that night
would have been lucky to see the sun rise.
Till well into the next day Fremantle was
without the pale of the law. Pubs opened
or shut as Rung thought fit, and the hooli-
gan did as he willed. Ttfe Disputes Com-
mittee got its crowd in hand then ; but things
remained in a state of tension until a lumper
whose head was cracked in Sunday’s battle
died. At this Hell was on the point of
being let loose ; but fortunately the influence
of those who knew what the State was up
against prevailed to secure a “voluntary”
withdrawal of the “Nationals” from the
wharves once and for all. This barely saved
the Government’s face, but it undoubtedly
saved Fremantle and Perth from an orgy of
anarchy. The industrialists marked their
triumph by dictating a three-minutes stop
for all trains and trams throughout the
State while the deceased “comrade” was
being buried.
At the back of the outburst was a pretty
solid aggregation of grievances endured by
the lumpers. No one will condone their
original action in 1917, when the shipping
of foodstuffs was vital to the Allies; but
it was a gross mistake to create a permanent
body of “loyalist” lumpers. For the past
18 months under 200 men have had pre-
ference and security of employment, while
the great resident body of 700 or 800 men
have had to share the crumbs of the surplus
work offering. Colebatch’s absurd display
on the Sunday fanned the smouldering
embers into a terrifying blaze, and the mis-
chief of it is that the Government has been
shown to be powerless to impose the law. The
worst elements are taking full advantage of
this, while even a number of trade-union and
political-labor leaders who previously were
regarded as sane are frothing revolutionary
stuff in public. Opposition-leader Collier,
who has enjoyed a reputation for sweet
reasonableness, made one of the most violent
speeches heard in the Babel of incendiary
rubbish. The great majority of the Labor
legislators took the stump, and “bloodshed”
and “force” freely interlarded all their wild
talk. _ There are signs that the silly busi-
ness will be gone on with all over Australia,
and that Fremantle provided the kick-off.
It is. tragic. As for Westralia, it is
hurrying towards bankruptcy, undeveloped
and unpeopled, its handful of residents
in a state of semi-starvation if one wretched
tub from the Eastern States is held up for
a week or so. And there seems no one with
ability to stem the tide of industrial in-
sanity and rescue the West from looming
disaster.
FLINDERS.
PLAIN ENGLISH,
Idealism—with a Bludgeon.
Thus President Wilson in the very early
days of the Peace proceedings:—
They fought to do away with an old order and to
establish a new one, and the centre and characteristic
of the old order was that unstable thing which we
used to call the “balance of power”—a thing in
which, the balance was determined by the sword,
which was thrown on'the one side or the other: a
balance which was determined by the unstable equili-
brium of competitive interests: a balance which was
maintained by jealous watchfulness.
All very fine and uplifting, no doubt; but,
as they say in the States, it cuts no ice.
Certainly the old balance of power is dead.
Germany . and Austria have gone 'under.
But .Russia already leans in the direction of
its old enemies; and it is reinforced by Bol-
shevism —a tremendous factor, which w r as
practically unknown when Wilson first pro-
claimed his evangel. It doesn’t make much
difference to the Allies whether the combina-
tion they have to oppose—and quell, in the
event of their Peace terms being rejected —-
is an organised one fighting more or less
according to rules, or a whirling upheaval of
four-fifths of Europe, ill-armed and ill-fed,
but drunk with the wine of revolution and
anarchy. The only considerable thing that
Wilsonism has done to the balance of power
so far is to extend it. Sydney Sun’s
observant representative in Paris wrore
lately of the Yankee dictator :
He repeatedly warns France, Britain and Italy
that if they do not accept his policies Bolshevism
will arise in their countries. He threatens Britain
with an overwhelming United States navy, with
food-shortage, and with the “freedom of the seas.’’
When Britain has declared for the Wilsonian point
of view, or proposed a compromise, France has
nothing to do but to acquiesce. For Clemenceau
knows that he cannot stand out against an Anglo-
American agreement.
The balance, as Wilson sadly noted, “was
determined by the sword” in the bad old
days before he appeared to regenerate the
world. He has changed all that. Because
America came into the war late it occupies
the position of Europe’s chief providore.
Not the least of the tremendous sacrifices
made by France and Britain, during the
years which America spent looking on at
their efforts, was the giving-up of food-pro-
duction and of the ships that brought food
from abroad. If either of these countries
proves recalcitrant, say, over the question
of tonnage-allocation, Wilson now produces
his sword, no less effective though it is not
made of steel, and settles “the unstable
equilibrium of competitive interests” on the
spot. In due course the balance of power
which is represented by the food factor will
disappear. But another balance will imme-
diately arise. Hiero of Syracuse could do
nothing but work to re-establish the balance
of power when Carthage fell; Britain,
Austria and Germany came together to re-
store it when Napoleon threatened to domi-
nate Europe; Prussia by its defeats of
France, Denmark and Austria made the
Franco-Russian Alliance of 1896 and the
Anglo-French and Anglo-Russian ententes
of 1904 and 1907 inevitable. It is a strik-
ing evidence of the unkillableness of the
immemorial old principle that the man who
is theoretically out to slay it is gaining most
of his points by the exercise of it.
Does Labor Approve of Cheap Labor?
When the Australian Labor Conference
meets to do the annual patching or recon-
struction of the party programme, it is to
be faced with the usual suggestion for the
reduction or abolition of “taxation on the
necessaries of life” and their replacement
by “a d.rect land or wealth tax.” There are,
as a matter of fact, no duties on the neces-
saries of life unless the excise on local beer,
spirits and tobacco is meant, for the sugar
excise has been abolished. Imported goods
are not necessaries except in the very rare
cases in which they can’t be produced locally,
and, barring Polar bears for menageries, it
is difficult to imagine what kind of articles
can t be produced locally, We can even
grow the lions. In a general way, imports
represent cheap labor—that is to say, labor
that is cheaper than it ought to be according
to Australian union standards, and which is
consequently able to compete successfully
against Australian products. In classing
imported goods as necessaries, a large class
of Laborites therefore specifies cheap labor
as necessary; and this cheap labor is more
and more of the colored variety, seeing that
India and China and Japan loom larger and
larger on the commercial horizon. This sort
of Laborite is in the same category as the
old slave-owner of the Cotton States, except
that he lacks the honesty to keep his cheap
colored labor openly on the premises and
call it Sambo. His plea is that, the present
duties being too low to prevent cheap absen-
tee labor usurping the place of the white
Australian article paid at union wages, these
duties should be lowered to give absentee
cheap labor a still bigger advantage. Then
when the taxes on the cheap-labor absentees
are abolished, it is invariably proposed to
make good the loss by taxing local wealth
and local land. Local wealth—not the im-
porter’s takings, which are not local —is the
product '-f local white labor or rather of
such local white labor as the competition of
the foreign cheap substitute permits, and it
ought to be encouraged and diffused rather
than taxed except in case of necessity. But i.f
it is struck by more low-wage competition as
well as by fresh taxation, there isn’t likely
to be much left to diffuse. As for land, it is
assuredly a necessity, which imnorted frills
and lollies are not. There is nothing more
necessary under the sun. Land is taxed <o
raise municipal revenue and State Govern-
ment revenue, and super-taxed to prevent
the increase of b ; g estates, and the super-tax
has already broken up so many big proper-
ties into areas which are below the exemp-
tion limit that the proceeds of the impost
are diminishing fast. A great deal of the so-
called good land is so barren that it is sub-
sidised by the carriage of the products by
rail at half cost, and that kind is a poor
subject to load with extra burdens so that the
path of the mixed outs ; der may be easier.
Already the taxes on local land and wealth
amount to double those on the products of
the allegedly necessary, absentee, whereas as
recently as 1914 the absentee paid twice as
much as the local man. So the nerson who
isn’t here seems to call for no special encour-
agement. If his prices are outrageous they
can’t be much alleviated by reducing the
existing duties wlr'ch, apart from drink
taxes, amount to only about a penny in the
shilhng. In many cases the alien who runs
amok when he has no local comnet ; tion to
iear has lately nut up bis charges 200 per
cent., and .the penny is neither here nor
there.
«
Lifeboats of the Air.
From an Australian airman in England:--
Now that the homicidal phase of aviation has run
its course, flying authorities are beginning to discuss
means that may be employed to save the lives of air-
wrecked wayfarers of the future.
The parachute is almost as old as the first hot-air
balloon itself; but it was never received with proper
respect until it proved its worth in Prance bv sav-
ing the lives of more than 400 men who had been
marooned aloft under flaming bags of hvdrogen that
had been ignited by German incendiary bullets.
With war risks eliminated from its dailv life, and
fitted with engines to qualify it as a dir ; gible, the
portly airship is now quite as safe as the average
ground-vehicle, and many degrees safer than its
dashing young relative, the aeroplane. Yet while
the launching of a parachute from the former is
already a simple and oft accomplished act, in regard
to the latter there have been difficulties to over-
come. In the- first place, an open parachute is any-
thing from 12 to 15 feet in diameter ; so it cannot
be carried aboard aircraft like an open umbrella.
Before it became authorised as part of the equip-
ment of the British kite-balloon—or “sausage,” as
the Diggers called it —a container had to' be devised.
This was done, anil it was adopted by the military
in 1915.
Yet, although hundreds of balloon-observers were
saved by its use, the idea of applying it for the
benefit of fighting aeroplane pilots and observers was
for a long time discouraged. British authorities at
last, however, commenced to give the matter serious
attention; and in January, 1917, the first official
test was made by Capt. C. F. Collett. Others fol-
lowed ; and it was found that the weight of the
parachute cost the machine but two miles •in
60 minutes, and 50ft. in a 60-seconds climb. After
that disclosure the matter began to receive really
active attention. Sample machines had been fitted
with a small niche in the fusilage immediately
behind the pilot's cockpit, in which the perfected
apparatus—folded between two discs about 2ft. in
diameter: the whole weighing about 291 b.—could be
stowed without getting in the way. This pattern
was invented by E. It. Calthrop, an English engi-
neer ; and its outstanding advantage was that it was
folded with the mouth ever open to receive the
air that was to hold it up. Other parachutes were
liable to drop with the mouth closed over by stray
folds of the silk. In that case the upward rush of
air caused by the falling weight of the passenger
would press against and keep it closed; the para-
chute would then never open, and —something un-
pleasant would happen to the passenger. Eventually
the Calthrop idea was approved by the authorities
about October, 1918. A thousand were ordered; and
650-odd were delivered. But, alas 1 none were ever
fitted to our fighting machines; for the war incon-
siderately ended. It has since been estimated that
of the thojjiands of airmen killed over the fighting
line about 75 per cent, could have saved themselves
had they possessed parachutes.
The method of using the Calthrop parachute is
simple, yet not lacking in excitement. The passen-
ger nee! only leap from the machine, dragging the
apparatus with him, the container end of it still
fastened to the machine by about 14ft. of shock-
absorbing sling. When he has whizzed this far clear
of the ’plane the pull of his weight tells, and the
parachute then unfolds out of the container in a
long stream. By the time its apex parts from the
container the open mouth below has already started
to receive the uprush of air; and in the course of
the next 100 to 160 feet of the descent it is well-
filled and commencing to bear the weight of the
passenger. After that he has time to think, and—
although the critical point in his descent has been
passed—he also has plenty of time to enjoy an agony
of illimitable misgivings until he finds himself being
bumped along terra firma, some hundreds or thou-
sands; of feet lower down.
The procedure outlined abeve would act very well
in the case of a machine that had caught fire; but
in the case of a machine whose wings had collapsed
something more might be required. For it would
probably be falling at a greater rate than the
passenger and his parachute could leave the ’plane.
With the destructive dangers of aerial fighting
removed, and sane, steady flying the order of days
of peace, such an accident is not likely to happen.
Nevertheless, a method of launching has been devised
by the same inventor to cover thi3 risk also. In
this performance compressed air fills the most im-
portant rfile.
Airships are about to play a greater part in public
passenger-carrying than aeroplane fanciers ever ex-
pected ; and they will be even less liable to accidents
than the already wonderfully-developed giant aero-
planes now to be seen in England. There is no
reason why these should not be fitted with para-
chutes of the kind last mentioned, stowed behind or
above the passengers’ seats; the whole lot to be
released simultaneously by one movement of the
pilot's lever in ease of accident. And in the case
of the airship—although this has not been attempted
yet—a means will eventually be found of releasing
a balloonet (i.e., a compartment of the airship) sup-
porting the passengers only, leaving the heavy
engines and greater mass of the wreckage to sink,
while the passengers drift safely away in their aerial
lifeboat.
A Premium on Negligence.
In reply to your letter of the lilt., relative
to balance of your deferred pay, I have to inform
you that as your non-effective statement has not yet
been received from Abroad, no action can be taken
towards the finalisation of your account. However,
vou will be further advised when same comes to
hand.
This is the sort of missive which is being
dealt out to returned men all over Australia.
Many soldiers relied so confidently on get-
ting the balance of their deferred pay, after
the six-months’ interval fixed by the military
authorities, that they contracted liabilities
which they are now unable to meet. All
they can show to their creditors is the Pay
Department’s airy suggestion that at some
unspecified time the cash may be forthcom-
ing. It is the less satisfying to the credi-
tors inasmuch as they know that in nume-
rous cases these “non-effective statements”
have never turned up at all. There are men
owed sums like £6O and £7O to-day who have
no more prospect of getting their dues with-
out a law-suit than they have of becoming
Pope. The deferred-pay business reeks of
inequity, if not illegality, through and
through. It was instituted when Kitch-
enek’s estimate of a three-years’ war was
regarded by most people as absurdly beyond
the mark. In the past 4J years the Gov-
ernment has had the use of millions of its
servants’ Avages. on which it has paid the
paltriest interest; and the difference between
the rate it fixed and v the market price of
money to-day represe<sjs only a portion of
the amount of which the men have been
robbed. For example, no interest at all is
paid on sums withheld owing to delays in
finalising accounts at Horseferry-road and
elsewhere. In any event, this withholding
of 25 per cent, of each man’s pay for six
months (or indefinitely! was never in the
contract between the soMiers and the Gov-
ernment. It is a crude device to protect
officialdom from the consequences of its ser-
vants’ mistakes. The expeditionary—who
has earned his money if anyone has —is
called on to insure the Department out of
his own pocket avainst incompetence on the
nart of the Pay officials. It is as though,
in a business, an employer pa i- d no Avages
in full till he was satisfied that he had in-
curred no bad debts, that he had not person-
ally rrvsinid any of the petty cash, and that
his wife had not been over-doing it in the
way of new hats and dresses. It is ques-
tionable if the Pav Office has any legal right
to hold back a farth ; ng of a so’dier’s pay
for a day after he lands in the Common*
wealth and claims it; and when Peace is
signed there will no doubt be many to test
the point in the courts. Apart from all that
there is the element of common decency
which demands that if, through no fault of
the soldier, the Government cannot finalise
a man’s account after a reasonable time, it
should pay his claim and look pleasant.
The Mulga Squatter.
Tiie squatter ought to get himself defined by
Act of Parliament. One part of him needs
no assistance, but the other and bigger part
is a victim of misconception. In his brighter
aspects he is a person whose father acquired
the freehold of well-watered country for a
song—or even less, for often lie was hoarse,
and knew no music. At one time, for in-
stance, the old Governor didn’t leave till the
new one arrived, and the last act of the old
Governor was to give the new one a grant
of land if he wanted it. Then the first act
of the new Governor was to give the old one
a grant of land if he felt that it would do
him good. But there is a newer type of
squatter who has all the disadvantages of
the name with little of the profits. In many
cases he doesn’t own as much land as the
worker with a suburban hut and allotment.
On the surface of things he is a great man.
for he is lord—on a rental —of an area
which would be called a principality in Ger-
many. Sometimes he even thinks he is a big
man, and puts on airs unbecoming to a mere
lodger. Occasionally lie makes a fairly big
pile with good management and good luck
but he goes under quite as often as a man in
any other line of industry, if not oftener,
and his estate doesn’t figure largely among
the probate returns. At one time financial
institutions mistook him for a real squatter
of the old type and dealt with him accord-
ingly. In the crash that came about
in the eighties and nineties of last
century those that had made this mis
take struck amazing trouble and wrote
off many millions of money as lost.
It was even up to yesterday the pride
of the chairman of the affair that was pay-
ing 10 per cent, on the tenth of the capital
that wasn’t lost to state, at the annual
meeting, that the Australian Live-Stock
Bank or the Australasian Pastoral Loan
and Rabbit Co. had got rid of the last of the
stations which insolvent squatter-debtors had
left on its hands, and that it would never
have another on its hands if it knew how to
dodge the calamity. Nevertheless, partly
because of the length of his leasg,
the Federal authority taxes him on
what it alleges to be its value; and
there is a current row over it. Really
the length of the lease shouldn’t matter. It
has to be lonaer than the lease issued to the
tenant of Private Enterprise who rents an
apartment in a boarding-house, because in
the case of pastoral leases the landlord only
supplies the floor. The walls, which are
fencing, and the non-removable fui*niture
(buildings, tanks and occasionally a bit of
artificial grass) are supplied by the tenant.
But the length of the lease doesn’t prove ■
that the tenant won’t go broke over it or
that the land is worth any more than the
rent. In some cases the adjacent town, such
as Bourke. is losing population because its
lease of existence isn’t worth having; and
the lease in such a case is interminable.
Officering Australia’s Army.
The case for the Permanent Staff: —
If officers are brought into the permanent service
at their A.I.F. rank, promotion to junior officers will
be at a standstill, the service will be discredited as a
profession for young men, and Duntroon might as
well close its doors. It must also be remembered
that many of the present permanent officers sank
high militia rank on entering the permanent service
as lieutenants, and it is only fair to them that the
A.I.F. men should do likewise. Many of our per-
manent officers, also, have distinguished themselves at
the Front and gained rapid promotion (which
becomes honorary when they return), and these
would, of course, be in favor of retaining their rank
and pay. But this, again, would be most unfair to
various classes of their brother permanent officers!
(1) Those who left with the first or second division
and were wounded or invalided home, and on re-
covery were kept in Australia for necessary staff work.
(2) Those who were kept in Australia the first year
or two of the war as indispensables, and were only
allowed to go to the Front when many of the oppor-
tunities for quick promotion had passed. (3) Those
Duntroon graduates who distinguished themselves at
the Front, and in the ordinary course of events would
have reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel at least,
but were specially kept back for duty on the staff at
major’s rank. These Duntrooners, after four years
of brilliant service and promotion to major, have to
come home and be content with a lieutenant's rank
and pay. This happens to no other regular officer
in the world, and is bad enough without having citi-
zen officers brought in over their heads.
Many brilliant fighting officers are by education
and temperament quite unfitted for the drudgery of
staff-office work and the perpetual grind of supervis-
ing cadets and militia at squad-drill. There are, of
course, a few officers of the Permanent Forces who
have been comparative failures in the A.1.F., and
there is no doubt these should be retired to make
room for and encourage competent juniors. But there
is no pension system for officers retired for non-
medical reasons, and it hardly seems the tiling, pend-
ing such a system, to turn out into a cold world
middle-aged men, good peace officers some of them,
who have done their best and whose “incapacity is
largely due to the meagre facilities Australia gave
them for improvement in the past.
It is not correct to say that officers who have
specially distinguished themselves at the Front have
not received recognition by promotion at home.
Several lists of such advancements have been issued,
and no doubt more are to come. Further, Australia
does not lose the services of her A.I.F. officers if
they remain on the militia establishment. We have
no organisation higher than brigades at present, and
with the early formation of divisions and other units
there will be room for the employment on the divi-
sional staffs of militia officers whose service will
only be needed at the time of continuous training
and a few other days during the year. There should
be lots of room in our militia forces for the absorp-
tion of fighting officers of the A.1.F.; if not, they
can be placed on the unattached or reserve lists,
where many of our best A.I.F. officers came from.
The same situation arises in every country after a
war in which the standing army has been largely in-
creased. It has at present arisen in England and
the U.S.A., but each of these nations knows from
experience that it must stick to the regular officer.

The Gentle Art of Fake.
W. M. Fleming, recently sent a
sort of circular letter to the papers to prove
that manufactures are a failure, while going
on the land is taking the metalled road to
Golconda. This was the gist of the story,
and Fleming said they were Knibbs’s
figures and “unimpeachable” :
The number of persons in Australia engaged in
primary production as at last census was 586,148 ; in
secondary production 562,337 ; and the value produced
in that year was £137,814,000 for primary produc-
tion against £50,767,000 for secondary production. For
the year 1916 primary industries were responsible
for the production of £206,222,000 and secondary
industries £64,205,000... .Primary production gave
Australia more than three times as much return
per head for the numbers engaged therein as did
secondary industry. As the former does this in the
open markets of the world and the latter only by
tariff taxation, etc., etc.
There were only four glaring fakes in the
narrative:—
(1) Fleming nearly doubled the number of fac-
tory operatives—the kind that are supposed to
benefit by “tariff taxation” —by including with
them builders of houses, railways, roads and such-
like. There were 311,710 factory workers, not
562,337.
(2) The output of 311,710 factory workers (not
562,337) was £133,022,090 (not £50,767,000).
The latter amount was the value added to raw
material.
(3) In 1916 secondary industries produced
£172,574,845 (not £64,205,000). The latter was
again merely the value added to raw material.
(4) In the case oi primary production the dear
old Freetrader took, of course, the gross value of
the output, and set it against the net value of
manufactures. Thus the gross values of milk and
wool turned out don’t take account of the cost of
the raw materials, which include the high-priced
ram and the fodder. The gross value of the
biggest branch of agriculture is the value of the
wheat, which is put in regardless of such raw
material as seed, manure and sundries, and in one
recent year the crop didn’t much more than supply
next year’s seed. And the value of minerals dug and
forests cut down was put into the primary produc-
tion as all profit, and set against the net profits of
factories, though the digging up of minerals is not
only in the main a use of raw material, but of
material that will never be replaced. If the digging
up of a solitary diamond valued at £500,000 is
classed with the year’s primary output it may show
that primary industry is a great thing as compared
with manufacturing, but only on paper. And it is
the same with the finding of other things that only
happen once.
In short, W. M. Fleming’s Freetrade yarn
would be all right if all the inferences weren’t
wrong and the facts weren’t upside down.
It shows, at least, that the crop of bunkum
is still a big primary industry if only the
gross output is reckoned and no allowance
is made for the raw material, which is
Fleming’s imagination.
Australian Defence.
From yet another campaigner:—
The campaigner who criticises the Australian
Army Reserve scheme (B. 8/5/’l9) makes three main
points; and they all strike me as feeble.
(1) He complains that the training is only for
four days, and that half that time will be taken up
travelling to camp, pitching tents, etc. But that is
soldiering. Marching, entraining, selecting camp-
sites, laying them out, and getting under canvas—
these are amongst the most essential duties of a
fighting man’s life. In any case, though, this critic
will probably argue, four days is too little. Granted,
or, to put it in another way, 14 or 40 days would be
better. But the element of practicability has to be
considered. It would be unreasonable to expect the
civilians who will compose the rank and file of our
Reserve to do more. Compare their ease with that
of an English pre-war reservist. The English reserv
ist had in thousands of cases never heard a shot
fired. He was paid £5 a year as a retaining fee,
and he not only had no continuous training—he
wasn’t even called on to attend a single parade.
When the war started these men were recalled from
all over the world. They went, and after a few
weeks’ intensive training they were made into very
useful combatants. Every member of the Australian
reserve may be said to be a veteran. These soldiers
have seen fighting in different parts of the world
under the most modern conditions. They are young,
keen, energetic and intelligent. Could any sensible
man claim that they will make up a body other
than trained and effective?
(2) The campaigner of May 8 produces the old
story about Australians being only good at trench
warfare. As a matter of fact, all arms of the A.I.F.
were thoroughly schooled in mobile warfare, behind
the lines, in 1917 and 1918, and that they knew the
job was evidenced the moment Fritz was got on the
move. No better work, for example, was done by
the R.H.A. itself than by some of the Australian
Artillery Brigades from last August 8 onwards.
(3) The final objection taken is that “a soldier
has little or no guarantee that he will be linking
up with a unit that bears the name of his old regi-
ment.” Of course, it is possible that a 13th
Battalion man might find himself living in S. Aus.
or Queensland; and a member of the sth F.A.B.
might be domiciled in Hobart or Perth. What of it ?
The point is that, broadly, the battalions, artillery
brigades anl other units were formed, and still
remain, on a territorial basis. And even if men
here and there were unable to rejoin their old com-
rades for the annual training, this, at any rate, is
sure: when the recall came —in other words, when
the fighting started —every reservist would go
straight to his original unit as fast as the mobilisa-
tion authorities could get him there. And that, of
course, is the real end in view.
“Maori” : Many of the men who have re-
turned to these lonely islands have asked
themselves what is the matter with their
people. And one of the most thoughtful of
them told me in strict confidence that, in
his opinion, it is this: Maorilanders have
frozen souls. If only they could be thawed
out in the fires of enthusiasm, what fine
fellows we should find —what fine fellows
have been found on the battlefield and in the
atmospheres of larger lands! In his own
country the Maorilander looks sideways at
anything out of the ordinary which develops
in his midst. He has great weekly papers;
yet not one of them seriously attempts to
foster a national spirit or line of thought.
They have given him civic and provincial
pride; but he is afraid to think big. Really,
the only thing that is the matter with
him is diffidence. It is this which has
caused him to be ruled mostly by elderly
men. The young men couldn’t bring them-
selves to believe they were equal to the job.
But a new spirit is moving among returned
soldiers, and at the general election at
the end of this year there will be numbers
of young civilian and khaki candidates,
who will do one thing at least —make mess
OH, FOR A SPELL OF PEACE!
Sir Douglas Haig, in the course of a speech at St. Andrew’s University, said the passions from
which war arose still existed in every quarter of the globe. The people must be prepared, and they
should not tail to understand that the yellow peril was of the utmost seriousness. The Chinese must
eventually demand a place in the European labor market.”— Cable.
THE WORLD: "Boo !-hoo! Just as Pm getting it right, here comes a new master!”
of the old superstition that a man should
be voted for because he has been at the
game for donkeys’ years.

Although throughout the ’flu epidemic the
Government of Sydney has again proved
itself one of the most panicky in the world,
in one respect the city has never failed to
keep its head. It has the reputation of being
one of the most venereally-diseased white
ports in the world. It has lost, directly and
indirectly, through syphilis and gonorrhea,
more valuable citizens than influenza could
have slain if it had been encouraged by
every possible means to remain here. Other
citizens are being sacrificed daily; and their
children and their children’s children. Does
Sydney shudder? Not a shudder! Or, at
any rate, its politicians don’t shudder. For
it should be observed that the scares which
are so regularly fomented are in no sense
citizens’ scares. They are the property of
the politician. The people’s only province
is to pay for them. The plague agitation
in ras^e action which followed it
Id years ago made a reputation for sev-
eral Ministers. The “hatters” lie, the yarn
about the Lascars who were pushed off a
rock, and the “Socialistic Tiger” nonsense—
ail these were politicians’ scares. And in its
essence the influenza uproar was the same.
You never know how bad a friend is until
he becomes rich.
The Commonwealth police force, which
Hughes hatched out of the Warwick egg
looks like being allowed to die. It has
just moulted its Commissioner, and the work

The most persistent advocate of a munici-
pal milk-supply for Melbourne is a dairy-
farmer of influence and substance. His
name is John Farmer, and with his milk-
producing labors at Burwood he combines
the job of secretary to the 30-year-old Vic.
Milk-producers’ Ass. Time was when
Farmer was the only man in the association
who spoke for municipalisation. Now all
the members—2oo of them —support the
idea, mainly through Farmer’s continued
advocacy. The prime object-lesson in
favor of municipalisation is at Richmond,
where there are 30 plants supplying milk.
This means 30 owners and 30 managers and
30 refrigerators for the one suburb, with 30
lots of milkcarts covering the one network
of rounds.
It is characteristic of the ways of the
Freetraders who run the Repatriation busi-
ness that the making of pearl buttons and
tortoise-shell knick-knacks should be men-
tioned as a fitting occupation for returned
Diggers. No doubt, as the S. M. Herald
says, the making of pearl buttons and tor-
toise-shell gewgaws is an honorable occupa-
tion. But it is a trade in petty non-essen-
tials. The business is mostly in the hands
of colored folk who work 12 or 13 hours for
35., so that it would require much more Pro-
tection than it is likely to get. And Aus-
tralia has no special advantages—in one of
the lines, anyhow—as it has in connection
with woollen manufacture, where the raw
material is walking about all over the place.
It is the big robust industries to which
attention should be called. Australia wants
to produce shipbuilding and railway-building
material, including steel nlates, boilers anil
engines. Nine-tenths of the troubles of the
last few years arose from want of these
things. It wants to make more rope and
tarpaulins. What railway trouble didn’t
arise from lack of stock came about because
wheat and other perishables couldn’t be
moved in bad weather for want of coverings
for the trucks. Also there was want of
imported galvanised-iron to cover the wheat
that couldn’t be moved, and imported bags
to put it in, and imported wire-netting to
keep the rabbits out of it.
“Croson”: While Millen has no time for
the struggling Anzac tweed industry, which
would employ men, he is very keen on start-
ing reed-loom weaving, which would mostly
employ machinery. For £50,000 2000 hand-
weaving looms could be made in Australia,
providing work for the makers and subse-
quent employment for 2000 Diggers. Each
machine, it is calculated, would turn out
2600 yards per annum, worth, in the aggre-
gate, at a moderate 10s. per yard, £2,600.000.
The reed-loom machines cost £50,000 each,
employ only 20 men, and average £50,000
worth of material a year. But they have
one outstanding merit—they would be im-
ported.
Either the N. S. Wales Lands Depart-
ment claims far too much or the Common-
wealth Bureau of Science and Industry
knows far too little. For just when the
Bureau was publishing a statement to the
effect that a cure for the prickly-pear pest
had yet to be discovered, Ashfoird announced
that his officers had “no hesitation in assert-
ing that a means of destruction has been
found which will certainly destroy the pear,
and at a cost far below that of any other
method.” It is a spraying attack, carried
out, it is alleged, at a cost in chemicals of
dOs. per acre; and the application is very
simple. The tests seem, however, to have
been confined to the Northern tableland,
where, as a rule, the imported cuirse does
not grow more than four or five feet high ;
and the 20ft. jungle of Queensland may be
a different proposition. Still, the million on-
two Australian acres that are being added
every year to the area under the curse are
not tall jungle at once; and the new
development may therefore be of enor-
mous national value. That other imported
plague, the blackberry, which is only second
to the cactus in curse-power, is said to be
not affected by the poison which the N. S.
Wales Lands Department is using.
Sinn Fein leader Eamonn de Valera speaks
French, German, Spanish and Gaelic in
addition to English. What makes him so
dangerous is not his tremendous learning,
though, but his unfailing spirit and good
temper. England can handle the exas-
perated pathriot, but the one who laughs at
her prisons and charges all her actions to
national stupidity is a different problem.
A lady, whose husband didn’t appear to
contradict her, presented to the Melbourne
divorce judge the other day the story of
eight years’ happiness :
(1) That she and her family were frequently left
in empty houses without food or bedding. -
(2) That they were sent to Ballarat for an un-
seemly jest and landed there without a penny. The
old man followed on a hired bicycle, which he sold.
(3) That he frequently sold the time-payment
furniture, and put her out of business by selling her
time-payment sewing-machine. He also sold her
wedding-ring.
(4) That in four towns he paid the household bills
with valueless cheques.
(5) That he wore stolen clothes.
(6) That when he pretended to be a wharf-laborer
he was really a park loafer, and that he blackened
his face with coal dust to make a pretence of honest
toil.
(7) That he threatened to shoot the house-agent,
robbed the penny-in-the-slot gas-meter, stole the lead
fittings from the bathroom, had been in gaol for a
month, then for three months, then for 18 months,
and that the slow feet of the law were after him
for house-breaking and safe-breaking.
(8) That generally he was not up to much.
(9) That she didn’t know where he had got to.
The Court gave her a decree with costs
against her husband. You can’t beat the
Law for doing things in order.
“Otira”: The awarding of the ordinary
battle honors is liable to be a matter of rou-
tine. On one field, brigade H.Q. notified
battalion H.Q. that there were 20 M.M.’s
available, and to send a list. When the
awards were made, not one man on the bat-
talion list was mentioned. Inquiry revealed
that, through a clerical error, the list had
been confused with another, and the awards
had been given to 20 men who had refused to
be inoculated.
About the pushes of Melbourne: —
Much good Bolshevik material is being wasted in
Melbourne on mere pu,sh recrimination. Two
parties, vaguely described as belonging to the
“underworld,” quarrelled some time ago (date not
certain) about something not clearly known, and
have been shooting, battering and knifing, but
mostly shooting, ever since. The mortality is
small, but the intentions are of the worst. The
shooter, when captured, which is hardly ever, gives
no information. The shootee, when he comes to
the hospital with as many as six bullets in him,
gives none either, it being contrary to the rules of
the game to appeal to the police. Besides, to call
them in would mean supplying a clue which might
lead to 200 other clues. The Melbourne police are
a dispirited lot, anyhow. One reason is that the
cheap form of justice is served out mostly by unpaid
J’s.P. Some of them know no law; some are
frightened of the push and don’t want their heads
broken gratis, and some have customers to consider.
A very nervous J.P. in a dangerous district has been
known, when a push affair came before him, to
shout that the case was dismissed for lack of
evidence before the accused was much more than
half-way into the court doorway. Witnesses also
are nervous. Quite recently one had part of his
head knocked off outside the court door in full
view of two policemen who were there in expectation
of the event. A very recent shooting was done in
the busiest street of the city and the middle of
the day. The plaintiff was captured for once
because he stopped to put five bullets into the
defendant and to miss with two more. His grasp-
ing instincts were his undoing. A curious circum-
stance was that the damaged man had been recently
hauled up on two charges of attempted murder and
was out on light bail. Even in the midst of a
small civil war the casual justice of Victoria lets
armed men out on very moderate bail put up by
their fellow-conspirators, who are also armed.
Meanwhile peaceful folk are damaged or scared by
accident, and plate-glass windows are wrecked. In
one matter, a week or two ago, the ladies of a
household were held up by complete strangers while
another went upstairs to sandbag a sick man, and
they were off their victuals for days afterwards.
Pushes not being registered, the Arbitration Court
is powerless.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The state Governments alone owe
£260,000,000 raised in London, and there are
vast Commonwealth and private debts; yet,
though this means that our exports must
exceed our imports by about £14,000,000 a
year in order to pay our foreign creditor his
interest, we actually imported £0,213,000
more than we exported during the seven
months to the end of January. That high
tariff is wanted not only to provide work
for our population but also to save the coun-
try from bankruptcy.
Under the amended electoral law a Com-
mission has carved the Sydney and New-
castle areas into five-member electorates and
the rest of the country into districts that. will
send in three members apiece. The redistri-
bution is necessary, seeing that the new law
prescribes proportional representation; but
as various members see their seats in jeop-
ardy, the chances are that the scheme will
get 'stabbed in the back. In some districts
whose old electorates returned three Lib-
erals, the big Labor minority was perpetu-
ally disfranchised ; while for nearly 20 years
the thousands of Liberals in the far western
third of N. S. Wales never had a voice in
Parliament. The man who, at this hour,
tries to get a dagger into the scheme must
not be allowed to escape it himself when the
election arrives.
S. M. Herald has been wailing about the
shortage of houses in Sydney; and though
it found 14 reasons for the calamity it
didn’t mention the two that count most.
More money would be available for building
purposes if a crazy Government would cease
to mop up at huge interest every copper if
THE FEDERAL FLIRTATION.
THE MA STATE: "The huzzy! If I had
my rights it’d he my knees he'd he sit-
ting on!”
can lay its hands on and spend it on buying
votes under the cover of public works.
While there are Government securities to
be bought yielding about 6-J p.c. no one feels
like building houses unless he gets a rental
of or 15 p.c. They are subject to local
rates, State land-tax and possibly Federal
land-tax ; they wear out; they become obso-
lete ; they call for much repair and some
insurance; they are subject to total suspen-
sion of the interest through bad tenants or
lack of tenants; and, above all, they may
slump to half their value when the loan
boom bursts. Also there would be more
money for building if the insane tariff didn’t
demand that all the spare cash should go out
of the country in payment for imported
goods. During the last seven months Aus-
tralia had to find £6,200.000 in cash of one
kind or another because the value of the
goods—nearly half of them clothes —bought
abroad exceeded to that amount the value
of goods sold abroad. This item alone
would pay for a whole heap of houses to be
let by distracted house-agents.
The A.W.U. executive has had its official
say about the 0.8. U.: —
The drafters of the scheme simply took the I.WAV.
constitution without acknowledgment, with the sub-
stitution of an Australian equivalent in place of an
American term or word, and eventuallv the congress
adopted it holes bolus and put it forth as the work
of the “drafters.”
So the 0.8. U. is merely a camouflaged fire-
stick.
When N.S.W. Works Minister Ball was
boasting to the people of Newcastle at the
recent launching function at Walsh Island
that “ours is the only dockyard in Australia
able to undertake the construction of 10,000-
ton vessels for the Commonwealth,” he for-
got to mention that these dockyards were
constructed by an old Labor Government,
and that he (Ball) and the rest of his party
attacked the undertaking as a wicked waste
of public money. Probably they didn’t beli’ve
it; but* the party madness required them to
say it.
Next month will see a new State office
established in N. S. Wales for the alleged
benefit of poor people who can’t pay for the
litigation they want to start. There is
nothing much wrong with it; yet Australia
would be better off if it got a tariff for the
benefit of poor people who want to start
producing something. Sproule, who has had
a good deal of experience in magistrates’
and district courts and was admitted to the
Bar five years ago, will be in charge of the
new agency. It won’t do the law work
itself, but will pass on approved cases to
sharks in private practice.
The re-shuffle of seats in the Peake Min-
istry (S-A.), consequent on Butler’s ejection,
brings in Ritchie to take charge of Works
(including Railways) and Agriculture.
Peake himself takes over Butler’s old and
difficult job of Treasurer and Controller of
the Wheat Scheme. Peake was Treasurer
first in 1905. under Price, and has had seven
or eight years’ experience of the thankless
job. Ritchie has had previous experience
of office, always under Peake. Meanwhile
Butler, at a large and enthusiastic meeting
at Gawler, complained of “the long and
cleverly-planned smoke-screen raised by
those who were themselves on trial by'
another Commission.” He’s going to tight,
he says.
One of the uneonsiderod perquisites of a
State Excellency is a six months’ salary
bonus, camouflaged as “leave of
absence-” He starts his leave
on the day he vacates his job,
and for half a year remains
Governor by official fiction, his
salary being paid in advance-
SC Arthur Stanlev, the Ex. for
Victoria, begins this final stage
in August, leaving his orna-
mental duties to be taken over
by Chief Justice Irvine. The
six months’ holiday is all in
the game, of course, but what
an absurd game it is! The life
of a State Governor, though not
one eternal holiday, is suffici-
ently easy-going for most of the
time when he’s in town, and is
gladdened by an annual retire-
ment to his mountain home,
where he finds tongues in trees,
sermons in stones, and good in
everything. If he breaks the
monotony of rural joys by going
to town once a month to open
a flower-show or attend a
charity matinee, it’s about as
much work as he crowds into
his annual holiday. Yet an
over-grateful Government can’t
let him tear himself away from
his gilded position without pre-
tending to grant him six months’ leave of
absence, which only serves to emphasise that
he could be done without altogether.
The production of hand-woven tweed has
never been really extinct, owing to the supe-
rior quality of the goods. It is now a fairly
big and very prosperous returned soldiers’
occupation in England, where the making of
“Blighty” tweed employs over 500 men and
expects to employ many more, for the output,
is ordered 10 years in advance. The making
of “Anzac” tweed in Australia showed a
small profit from the very beginning, which
none of the hen- and wheat-settlers did. It
paid from £3 15s. to £4 a week for 40 hours’
work, which is certainly more than the aver-
age farm-hand makes. One firm alone offered
to take the output of 25 looms for five years
ahead at a payable figure, and other orders
could be had in abundance. A request was
made for a steady supply of good yarn (to be
paid for, not cadged) from the Government
mills. The men who were worrying over the
business got it for a while, then the supply
became inferior and precarious. They also
suggested a loan of £5OOO or £lO,OO0 —about
the cost of putting four soldiers on the land
—but the yarn was the main thing. The
Freetrade Minister treated the whole busi-
ness as if it was a criminal with many pre-
vious convictions. Out of the depths of his

times, which the English experience proves
that it isn’t. But it was manufacture, not
agriculture, and the mighty importing in-
terest said it must die.
The Federal Income Tax Department
speaks through the mouth of the Argus :
The mistakes made by income-tax payers _ against
themselves are stated to amount to a substantial sum,
and it must be remembered that it is no part of the
department’s duty to point out errors that do not
militate against the revenue.
If that is right it puts the Government on a
par with the man who, receiving money in
excess of his cheque from a bank-teller,
pockets the lot and walks out. He isn’t
quite a thief, but the difference isn’t worth
worrying about.
The British Coal Commission was recently
favored with the society of the Earl of
Durham, who testified that he owned 12,411
acres of coal-bearing land which was leased
to companies. In 1913 he received as
“royalties, rents and privileges”—-that is,
for sitting back and taking no chances —
£58,911, or £4 14s. per acre. Unlike the
agricultural landlord, who is much smaller
potatoes, the Durham kind of man isn’t
troubled over drainage, repair of farm build-
ings, insolvent tenants and such-like, and
his wife hasn’t even to profess to be a Lady
Bountiful to the ancient, respectful, rheu-
matic, asthmatic villager with snowy locks
and a smock frock. His tenants are com-
panies which don’t wear a smock frock.
In Australia the coal industry as a rule has
to support three classes: (1) the miners;
(2) the carriers, dealers and such-like; (3)
the cos. which found the money for machi-
nery and paid the wages during the long
preliminary term before the concern began
to pay for itself. England has all these to
support and a Durham or Northumberland in
addition, and a man who charges £4 14s. an
acre for looking on without risk or responsi-
bility takes some supporting.
To the complaint that he undermined his
own law by buying off the coal-miners and
mine-owners, Watt says his triumphant
reply is that “the factory whistles through-
out Australia have been sounding their call
to work.” In other words, when the law
threatens to collide with somebody who
owns a big punch, it is best for the law to
come to terms
with the foot-
pad. It can
recover its
majesty when
it meets a small
sneak thief. A
man who says
that and yet
wears a jaw like
Watt’s ought
to be prose-
cuted for false
pretences.

not a bag of

out of Au s-
tralia unless it
is very distinctly
branded “Second Grade” —or “Tenth Grade”
or whatever it may be. The Asiatic buyer

of the Australian exporter; and we can’t

Treasurer McPherson of Victoria went to
London to renew a £4,000,000 loan ; but he
is able to explain that he really requires only
£2,750,000, for his State has saved up
£1,250,000 of its own. This makes him so
absolutely unique that there is talk of classi-
fying him as a newly-discovered animal and
putting him in the Zoo. So Victoria will be
lucky if it gets its McPherson back again.
Of course, it had to come. McPherson
having promised the tradesmen on Vic. rail-
ways that he would make their pay the same
as had been awarded by Wages Boards to
persons outside the service, Lawson has had
to undertake to provide another £40,000 a
year to similar men in other Government
employ. Yet the unfortunate clerk, lawyer,
surveyor, teacher, etc., in the Government
service is always expected, when he views 7m
wretched pay. to remember the compensating
advantages of permanent employment and all
that sort of thing.
At last N. S. Wales Railways have what
they ought to have had 30 years ago—a coal-
mine of their own. That so large a con-
sumer should have been dependent on pri-
vate owners has long been an outrage on
business principles. The scandal has at
last been ended by the Government transfer-
ring to the Commissioners the Western
District property which the Mines Depart-
ment had just started to develop when the
war interposed.
The law is a very tired ass. After long
agitation and many fatalities it decided to
order all Victorian lift-owners to affix a
safety device to the doors of lifts and lift
wells. But it didn’t say anything about
using them, so they are mostly thrown out
of gear and left so.

Periodically this obese co. finds itself dragged
on to the operating-table to be probed by
Royal Commissions. It is again under the
knif-e, and this time, as the directors put it,
“the Commission seems to have been ap-
pointed for the purpose of advising the
Federal Government on the question
whether the control of the industry should
be vested in the Commonwealth. In addi-
tion the Commission is to make recom-
mendations on the measure of Protection re-
quired and on the Government continuing
the fixing of prices and rates of wages and
other conditions." In the report accompany-
ing the accounts, distributed before the Com-
mission began its sittings, there is a bark
which has almost an impudent air about it.
“Another Royal Commission has been ap-
point'd to inquire into the sugar industry.
Only six vears have elapsed since the last one
published a report.” Yet recent wails of the
O.S.R. were alone grounds for inquiry. It is
only six months since the chairman grieved
that, “so far as we are concerned, we would
be glad if the million and a half we have
laid out in Queensland had been invested
elsewhere.” If the co. has nothing to con-
ceal, it reasonably might, in such circum-
stances, have welcomed inquiry. Instead, it
almost groans —and then proceeds to pass
out a special “Peace bonus” of 4s. per share
Nor is this the first time the management
has distributed a bonus at a most inauspi-
cious moment.
Though the last Commission presented its
report only six years ago conditions in the
industry have changed considerably So also
has the position of the C.S.R. To begin with,
since the last inquiry it has disclosed no
less than 34 millions of hidden profits. In
other words, during the periods subjected to
inquiry by previous Commissions th-e pub-
fished'accounts were not disclosing all the
profits the co. had made. In 1915 assets
were written up by 34 millions, the whole
of it being passed out to shareholders in the
form of bonus shares in the C.S.R. Co. ot
Fiji and N. Z., Ltd. That concern’s dis-
closed profits have been as follows:

So, despite all the lamentations concerning
labor difficulties, adverse seasons, unsympa-
thetic Governments (not always Labor Gov-
ernments either) and dozens of other troubles
which cause directors loss of sleep, the co.
continues to make profits. And, after past
experience, the public cannot be blamed if it
refuses to take even recent disclosed profits
seriously. Possibly the management has not
been abie to sock away so much as it used
to. But it should be part of the job of the
present Commission to get into the inner
recesses of the concern and find out pre-
cisely what profit the co. is making out of
one of ihe public’s principal necessities. The
accounts say next to nothing: merely a line
that net profits were so-and-so. There is no
whisper of the amounts clipped for deprecia-
tion, etc., before profits are brought into the
balance-sheets. Maybe the amounts written
off lately have not been excessive; nobody
but those inside knows. It certainly would
be interesting to learn how it is that, despite
all the troubles which are the subjects of the
directors’ half-yearly wails, the Australian
concern can continue to show gradually in-
creased profits. According to the first table
the past half was the best so far experienced,
yet the damage sustained by the fire at the
Pyrmont refinery was “not nearly covered by
insurance.”
So far as Fiji is concerned, there are in-
dications that it is not quite the Land of
Hope that it was thought to be. There is
“an urgent need for immigration.” Even the
British Government has proved a disappoint-
ment: “Unfortunately in this matter [con-
tinued labor supply] we have not received
from ihe British Government, the assistance
in maintaining our rights that we are entitled
to, and which was promised.” No mention
is made of the growing independence of the
Indian labor force. It is not nearly so tract-
able as it used to be; and there is now an
Indian Imperial Association of Fiji which
has its voice heard even in Downing-street,
petitioning that Fiji be not annexed to the
Commonwealth or Maoriland, but “con-
nected rather with India, our mother coun-
try.”
If the co. had not been always so grasping
and often so arrogant, it would now receive
more sympathetic consideration. It has cer-
tainly built up a wonderfully efficient organ-
isation. It has a team of chemists always at
work to chase by-products. The Bulletin
doubts whether either grower or consumer
would benefit fi-om the nationalising of the
industry at present, particularly if it should
fall under the management of politicians
whose greatest claim to the job was that
they had once written an Ode to Efficiency,
or something of the sort. Nevertheless, the
consumer should be protected. Eventually
some form of control, as in the case of N. S.
Wales and Queensland gas cos., will be
attempted. So far. all efforts to put the co.
into harness have failed ; but few things are
more certain than that the very clever man-
ncrem-ert will one day find itself champing
a Government bit.

S. Australia experienced more of the in-
conveniences of war than its Eastern .neigh-
bors ; also because it lias not shared to the
same extent in war spendings, there has not
been the same air of artificial prosperity
about the Middle State. The eight banks
doing business in S. Aus. in March, 1914,
had deposits, apart from Government money,
totalling £11.404.000. At March 31 last
the figures had grown to £14,688.000 —an in-
crease of just under 29 p.c. Meantime N.
S. Wales deposits had expanded 41 p.c.
S. Aus. has done well with its. wool and
metals, and not at all badly with its wheat,
but there has been no such boom on paper
money as some other parts of the Common-
wealth have had. Possibly S. Aus. will be
the better off in the long run for having
escaped some of the bogus prosperity. Any-
how. this is certain: if there is to be a
tumble, it will not have to fall so far as
some of its sisters to reach normal.
Profits are still poorer than they were in
any of the four pre-war years; and in this
case there are fewer reasons, to suspect that
the shrinkage has been mainly due to the
management setting aside profit to provide
against possible future trouble. Consider
a comparison of the balance-sheet figures
since 1914: —

The Bank of Adelaide at March 31 was carry-
ing no less than one-eleventh of the total
debt of the Australian Wheat Board to the
whole of the States. Deduct this £1,796,320,
and that left £2,625,018 representing ordi-
nary advances, and probably a big wad of
this consisted of aid to clients to take up
War Loans. Thus the bank’s ordinary
advances business was smaller than it used
to be, and the chances of sweet earnings were
diminished. In fact, the wheat load was
so heavy that the Government came to the
bank’s relief, and there was £423,384 of
Government monev in the business as at
March 31—all but £15,000-odd of it carry-
ing interest, too.
With Government pools and War Loans
and shipping and exchange difficulties out of
the way, and with business now extended to
the Eastern States, the Adelaide’s profits
should move ahead of previous records. _ If
the bank has so far gained little or nothing
by the war, it has certainly lost nothing in
solidity or prestige. At the latest balance,
it owed the public £5,596,069, and of that
almost 39 p.c. was in liquid assets, not in-
cluding the Government-guaranteed wheat
advances. Including the wheat advances
the proportion was 71 p.c. From the deposi-
tors’ point of view that shows exceptional
safety. From the borrowing client’s, it
suggests that the management should
soon be in a position to make liberal
advances. The bank also shows strength
in another direction: after paying the
current div. there remained £1,083,877 of
shareholders’ funds, and for every £1 of
its own the bank held only a little over £5
of the public’s, which also included the big
Government deposit to help finance S. Aus.’s
wheat.

This is a holding concern only ; but, unlike
most such cos., it has the splendid habit of
bringing the subsidiary offices’ balance-
sheets into the light. Thus it is possible to
obtain some idea of the state of health of the
members of the family group. The Extended
Co. holds all the 150,900 £1 fully-paids
which comprise the capital of Arthur Rick-
ard and Co., Ltd., and 49,422 of the 50,000
£2 paids in the Ilaymarket Permanent Land,
Building and Investment Co. Last year
both concerns showed improved profits.
Arthur Rickard and Co. made £14,996, com-
pared with £12,971 in the previous year,
and the whole of this has gone into the
parent's pocket. The Ilaymarket seems to
be securing a better foothold after an in-
different career, and its net profits last year
amounted to £4675, compared with £2020
for 1917 and only £136 for 1916. There has
been considerable cleaning-up in this con-
cern since it was put in the Arthur Rickard
stable, and over £30,000 has gone in four
years in writing-down old assets and in
meeting losses by unloading lame properties
at prices under book values. Last year tlie
last of the city properties was swept out—
the Occidental Hotel, which had been held
for 30 years and had been a consistent loser
—and the co. was fortunate in getting rid of
it at book value. The directors now say
that “it may be confidently stated that the
assets are conservatively valued, and that
the co. is in a thoroughly sound position.”
Two and a half years’ pref. divs. remained
unpaid 12 months ago, but, by arrangement
with holders, the indebtedness has been con-
verted into 51 p.c. fixed deposits. And as
the cash position has looked up, divs. have
begun to flow again.
Most of the business of the two subsidi-
aries is speculative. If conditions are favor-
able, good profits are possible; but land cos.
are among the first to feel the pinch in dull
times. So far as the security for capital is
concerned, this shows what there is to repre-
sent the £275,839 put up by Extended share-
holders (the figures of the three balance-

There would thus appear to be net assets
with a book value of almost 225. 6d. to re-
present each £1 share. But that 22si 6d.
depends entirely on the valuations at which
the properties, etc., stand in the books. Also,
over £90,000 of the Arthur Rickard Go.
funds are in side-line enterprises (partly
N.S.W. Realty Co. and Hotel Sydney),
about whose affairs little is heard. Property
values at tlie moment are at a very high
level, and the artificial prosperity created by
the war,favors this concern particularly, tor
most of its business is with people _ot
moderate or small means who are acquiring
house allotments on t.-p. terms. At present
there is little trouble in getting in balances,
nor is any damage incurred through pro-
perties being thrown back on the cos.’ hands.
But the investor has to take into account
what will happen if values do slump and
there is little demand for the cos.’ goods.
The security for capital and the chances ot
profits depend on how future values compare
with purchase prices paid by the cos. Are
present favorable conditions going to con-
tinue? It is difficult to forecast, for thougli
there are now many more people able to
launch out into house property (especially
returning soldiers with their savings), tne
effects of the war bill cannot be overlooked.
We have not started to pay for the war yet.

Disclosed profits have improved during re-
cent years, but there was nothing fat about
the co.’s war record. Though the N. S.
Wales South Coast has had better prices for
most of its products, it has not been so pros-
perous that freights and fares could be
skied as thev were by the big concerns dodg-
ing U-boats and other frightfulness and
transporting goods for profiteers. Still .the
improvement may have been a good deal
better than shown. Like most shipping
cos., the Illawarra does not say very m.uch
about itself. But besides the profits shown
in the table, since 1915 a repairs, public risk
and contingencies reserve has grown from
£3500 to £12,500. The dropping ot £9OOO
into this account in . three years was swift,
going, but how much should be regarded as
a set-off against wear and tear, and how
much has merely been dropped into the
stocking for future comfort, cannot be ascer-
tained. Also the past year’s profits have
been curtailed by £2450 which has gone into
a taxation reserve, though presumably all
current taxes have' been otherwise provided
for. Strange things have been happening
in many cos. with regard to these taxation
reserves ; and in some cases they have pro-
vided a handy back door through which to
push some profit when the war-profits tax-
collector calls. If the Illawarra Steam
has otherwise provided for all taxation calls
during the past term, then the half’s actual
profits were the best the co. has 'disclosed.
But everything is dependent upon the
amount provided for depreciation, for with-
out these figures it is impossible to accu-
rately gauge each term’s actual results.
According to the table a surplus of only
£3063 has been shown in four years after
paying an average div. of slightly under 9
p.c. p.a. But here is another view of the
progress made since 1915: —
1915. 1919.
Liquid assets .. £13,427 £51,657
Liabilities .. .. 11,413 6,366
Surplus .. £2,014 £45,291
During that period the ancient little Hill-
meads has been the only vessel disposed, of,
and presumably it did not stand in the books
for much; while no new steamers have beeu
added. But £27.826, or nearly 35 p.c., of
the book value of the fleet has disappeared.
Meantime the surplus of more or less liquid
assets has grown by £43,277.

paid £25,000 into court, and a horribly expen-

-Adelaide Gas Co. has given the City
a squeeze. For years past it has
lighted the streets for £4006 annually. The
j•fl9ift COn * rac * : offered is for three years at
xbold annually, an increase of considerably
over oO p.c. It has been accepted, too.
The Commonwealth’s gold output is
rapidly going from bad to worse. To the
end of April this year 350,4860 z. (fine)
were won, compared with 493,00i)0z. and
411,4620 z. for the first four months in 1917
and 1918 respectively. Westralia’s 266,6520 z.
was over 20 p.c. less than the yield of two
years ago.
* * * . .
When it was floated off 31 years ago Block
14 seemed to have the best position on the
I 1 the Broken Hill Prop.; but they
oidn t know as much about the lode as they
do now. The lode is a sort of V turned
upside down, and the point of the V was
occupied by the northern end of the Prop,
and Block 14. They got the ore first, but
they also got through it first. Hence for
many years past no work has been done on
the north end of the Prop, and Block 14 has
been kept alive by rooting around for car-
bonates. In addition it was left with a
small quantity ot sulphides. There were not
enough to warrant the erection of a modern
mill, so an arrangement was made with
Block 10 three or four years ago to handle
this ore. Last half-year’s output was 3817
tons carbonate, which cost no less than
£3 ss. per ton to mine, and .13,209 tons sul-
phide, which cost 28s. Gd., including railage
the few hundred yards to Block 10. Work-
ing account showed a profit of £7807. When
the end was seen to be drawing near the co.
looked round for another mine; but the only
thing of any consequence it found was the
King Island Scheelite. It has had three divs.
from this, the last (Is. on 39,500 shares)
during the half-year. These and other shares,
at cost less option expenditure written off.
stand in the books at £11,910; so it looks as
if Block 14 will come out all right over its
outside mining specs, so far. Total net profits
for the half were £7745; a Is. div. on all
shares plus interest on the prefs. (10 p.c.
n.a.) took £O5OO. Including the shares in the
Scheelite show, the liouid assets are now
£47,977 in excess of liabilities. What the mines
are worth this paper isn’t going to guess. All
tungsten metals, of which the King Island
product is one, are said be largely over-
stocked ; and. though it may recover later on,
lead will almost for certain go a lot lower.
And it doesn’t look as though costs will.
At Bendigo mining not only looks a bit
better in the Amalgamated’s melon-patch, but
also in the new Red, White and Blue and in
the Central Blue. This little wonder has had
the usual barren time since it shot its
bolt at 300 and 400 feet, although it has
put . out crosscuts at odd intervals while
s'nking to 1900 ft. Now it looks as if some-
thing sweet has shown up in the shaft in the
form of a. make of quartz in centre country,
with a slide at the east end of the shaft at
1960 ft. It won’t take the crowd that runs
the Central Blue long to get the measure
of the development. As usual with stocks
that have a good record, the mere whisper
that stone had been got set the market sky-
ing. New Red, White and Blue, on the
same line, looks as if it was emerging from
the Rip Van Winkle stage, as specimen
stone has been picked up in the crosscut
400 ft. south at 1600 ft. That the dyke is
near may account for the enrichment, so it
is a bit early to go castle-building over the
strike. The co. has moderate stone in the
big run of spurs at this level, and if these
would only yield a bit better another veteran
would give the field a lift.
* * * *
Work is proceeding at 21 shafts in the
Bendigo Amalgamated’s five-souare-mile
block, and it would be queer if Moline could
not see something to give him hope. This
month it is the old Unity that looks better,
for in crosscutting through the lower por-
tion of the Victory spurs north of the shaft
values have improved from 4dwt. to 7dwt..
thus affording some profit. The presence of
gold at this point brings more than the
ordinary cheer, as the stone is ahead of
where the Carlisle is working on the same
big run of spurry country. The crosscut
is to go out further, because the best gold in
the Carlisle has been got in the slates west
of the Victory east back. In the Cornish
shaft good-grade stone is also showing in
the same channel as the Carlisle 1200 ft.
stopes. The cream of the stone being mined
on the field is from the Constellation, where
the 673 ft. intermediate level has at last got
the stone that pitched out of the stopes at
the level below. To the south in the level
prospects show towards the Golden Pyke
shaft, and it is probable that the co. will
have another shot at. the same reef in the
Northern mine at 568 ft. Then things seem
to be more on the turn at .Johnson’s and
the Windmill shafts. But it is all a weary
wait, and with hungry critics about because
calls have come instead of divs.
* * * «
Giblin, of Edna Central (W.A.), the other
day struck Collins-street after years of ab-
sence, and the yarn circulated that he was
over to merge Edna May into his own show,
for no one could believe that, with the
Central just picking up the Consolidated
shoots over the boundary-line, it would agree
to be the one to be swallowed. All this
talk came out of a threat that the Edna
would get what stone it could out of its
ground right to the Deeps boundary at
480 ft., and then move to dry quarters in the
upper levels while looking about for a new
shoot or testing a mine elsewhere. The
truth is that the Central would not disdain
a decent pumping agreement, but it has too
good an opinion of itself to be tacked on to
any other show. That may be all right; but
to take on the water single-handed will be
a very stiff job when the big mine stops its
pumps. The presence of Giblin on the
Block set the bears rushing to cover, though
their risk does not appear to be startling
with a mine wanting every ton of ore that
can be developed, and that’s the position of
the Central. What also has given the
shorts a jolt is that the stone that Giblin
has been following on the Main lode, where
it pitched over the boundary from the Con-
solidated, carries very fair gold. Giblin at
present cannot be very far off the Consoli-
dated at the 320 ft. level, so his legacy won’t
come to hand in full till the next level is
out from the Central shaft. That will not.
be very much before the end of the year. Still
the bit of stone, available will come in very
handy to keep things going till it is known
whether the Edna will be reasonable over
the water question.
“O.B.”: Westralian mineowners are still
agitating for the cancellation of the regula-
tion prohibiting the importation of potas-
sium explosives under the name of gelignite
after the end of this year. It appears that
gelignite containing either potassium nitrate
or sodium nitrate is on the approved list in
some of the Eastern States, the only stipula-
tion being that gelignite containing sodium
nitrate must be rolled in waterproof wrap-
pers unless specially exempted. There is
some talk of manufacturing explosives
locally, but it will be difficult to get mine-
owners to forget their preference for im-
ported articles, and also induce the miners
to use them. The writer has known the
men underground to down tools on many
occasions rather than use explosives which
were not quite to tlieir liking.
Edna May Consolidated (W.A.) has
offered to settle Edna May’s claim for pump-
ing services by paying £2OOO down, and £lOO
a month. The Edna May Board is willing
to accept the £2OOO. but wants £139 together
with some odd shillings and pence a month
in the future ; and says it will not accept a
penny less. As neither side is likely to
give way it now rests with the Warden,
who reserved his decision, to determine what
is a fair thing for Consolidated to pay.
Golden Point, Westonia (W.A.), is driving
on a vein of ore at 140 ft. and publishing
high values in order to buck up an almost
defunct market. The last assay announced
was ISOs, per ton, but whether this was the
average for the whole face or just the value
of a small speck of stone is not definitely
stated. If these reports don’t induce share-
holders to continue paying calls, some bor-
ing will probably be started to see what
can be done in that wav.
* * *" * #
For some time Yilgarn (W.A.) has been
the unhappy hunting-ground of several small
Adelaide- and Melbourne-financed cos., and
now others are butting in. The latest is
the Empress. Its quarry is the Desert
Gold, some six miles south of Southern
Cross. The lode is said to be well defined
and to assay up to an oz. But the mill is
the only test.
Ihe hard-luck story of the people who
lost the Yampi Sound (W.A.) iron deposits:
So Jock Thompson is forming a co. (B. l/5/’l9)
to work Yampi iron ; though it was understood that
when he successfully pushed us out his eo was
already formed. We did not have a fair run.
Excessive freights and other war troubles beat us.
In fact, we had trouble from the beginning. Before
the B. 11. Prop, made a start at Newcastle we were
told that an ironworks proposition in Australia was
impossible. Various experts gave us the cold-shoul-
der; though one party did go so far as to offer us
what we paid for the show! Finally, Percy Kean
went to England, and the reception there was equally
cold. At last some Germans were found to finance
the scheme. But the war settled that. Japan, how-
ever, would have taken the ore all the time. As we
could not raise the quarter of a million required for
works we were left. We would not have minded if
the Federal or State Government had taken over the
show, even if we had made a loss; but to lose it a 3
we nave done hurts.
* * * *
“O.B.”: I revisited Kanowna (W.A.) the
other day after an absence of 20 years, and
found the busy hive of the late ’nineties
merely a graveyard. As on a number of other
\Y estralian goldfields, it seems as if by some
mysterious instinct the earliest diggers were
directed to the richest patches. All the big
lumps of gold and rich crushings were ob-
tained during the first few years, and a
good deal of the wealth first fell into the
hands of men who were subsisting on credit
given them by good-natured storekeepers.
At one time the main thoroughfare was lined
with prosperous pubs, stores, etc., while from
a side street issued a daily newspaper edited
by Samson, who now roams about Federal
Parliament House. The paper shut down
years ago, most of the pubs, stores and rest-
aurants have disappeared, and all but one
or two of the churches have been blown
down. As for mining, it is as dead as last
year’s mushrooms.
*** . *
The slump in tin from £3OO to £207 per
ton has knocked holes in the profits of Mt.
Bischoff Extended (Tas.). The show can
never be other than a slow-goer, as it not
only has narrow shoots to work but low
tin contents to grapple with. Thus the
shoots worked during the last six months
have been only a foot wide. With the re-
covery £ p.c. tin per ton, conditions are such
that butter can only go on the bread when
the metal market keeps high and labor costs
low. To get costs down the co. has added
10 heavy stamps to its mill. The bulk of
the ore sent to the battery is from No. 0.
with some sweetening from the top levels.
The winze going down to meet the rise from
No. 9 some 200 ft. below carries a narrow
lode with poor metal contents. From pre-
sent appearances it looks as if the backbone
of the mine is the stone between Nos. 5 and 0
levels, as below these points all exploratory
work has been on under J p.c. material.
What it costs to keep a show like the Ex-
tended on the move is indicated by the fact
that it took £13,596 to net £2606 in six
months. The good times of the war allowed
a snug reserve to be built up, and that nest-
egg makes the purchase of the new battery
possible. Fortunately the co. is capitalised
on a small scale, so it doesn’t require much
profit to churn out occasional divs.
* * *
Work stopped at Mt. Lyell Blocks (Tas.)
last week and distress signals have been
hoisted. Some time back the co. struck
water troubles in the bottom level, and mine-
manager Carroll fled from the flood and
started a drive at the 630 ft. level, where he
figured on striking bodies of copper clays
which showed profit long years ago. When
about 320 ft. from its destination the drive
lan into ground as hard as the average luck
ot . shareholders, so that “operations at the
mine have been suspended and expenditure
reduced to a minimum.” Probably a further
reason why things are so is the large wad
of forfeited shares. There is talk of another
call, but the Board is going to chat it over
with shareholders. It would be best for all
concerned if the co. sold out to Mt. Lyell
which requires the Lyell Blocks shaft for
a second ouening to the North Lyell. The
the deepest on the field
( Idlort.), should be a good asset, while the
mine and plant might bring in something.
?j U i rse ’ * n even t of sale, supporters
would lose all the “bright prospects” which
have been forecasted ; but they might prefer
to take that risk rather than chance drop-
ping more cash.
* * * *
Round Hill (Tas.) is opening up well.
Ihe lode discovered last October has been
driven on for 240 ft. and risen on 70ft.. and
has maintained assay values. It is between
well-defined walls, and averages 18ft. wide.
The only fly in the butter is, what is to be
the market value of the lead? However,
manager John Craze is pushing ahead with
development work, and there will be a plen-
tiful supply of ore to work on when the
market looks up again.
* * * *
J. L. Strevens discusses briquettes:—
Briquetting industries on the lower-grade Austra-
lian coals are particularly difficult to establish, not-
withstanding the enormous reserves of raw material
that can be readily and cheaply mined, and which
need briquetting in some form or other for then-
best utilisation. The two fields that offer the best
inducements are Collie (W.A.) and Morwell (Vic.),
but in each ease the difficulty ia adequate supplies
of a cheap and efficient binder. In the U.S. and
Britain enormous quantities of coal-tar pitch, petro-
leum residues and asphaltum are available to convert
low-grade fuel into one equivalent in heating value
to the best anthracite. My proposal to convert Collie
coal smalls and fines into a fuel equal to the best
Newcastle coal by partially carbonising and using
the residuum obtained after distilling crude blaclcboy
oil (obtained by a special low-temperature retorting
of the outside portions of the tree) as a binder would
be only a temporary stop-gap until supplies of
cheaper Dutch East Indian crude oil residuum were
available However, as the blackboy product is the
only binder likely to be available at Collie for some
time and as excellent briquettes can be made with
it, a briquetting scheme for the Collie coalfield should
, P? rt ° f an - v I; *rge project having the utilisation
o blackboy in the most economic manner as a
basis. Another disadvantage with Collie coal is
the small oil or tar yield obtained in carbon-
ising. Morwell coal, though much inferior to Collie
from a heating point of view, yields double the quan-
tity of oil or tar on carbonisation, and its dependence
on outside sources of coal-tar supply is reduced to
an amount which could be readily supplied by the
N. S. Wales coke-ovens. The ideal coalfield for
briquetting would be one for which all the binder
could be obtained as a by-product in the coal car-
onising process, but, unfortunately, this does not
Colli 1 whl USt rn lia ‘ 7 he , neareSt a PP r oach to it is
, ’ r e the coal and blackboy are readily and

““1 blackboy for carbonising as it would coal,
the maximum daily output of briquettes could not
be expected to exceed more than about 150 to 200
tons, which is only a very small proportion of the
demand that would arise, especially for bunkering
purposes.

Harry Morton, who had a brief reign as
N. S. Wales Speaker in 1913, isn’t a candi-
date to succeed Cohen, now Judge ; so little
Dan Levy and Colquhoun will fight it out.
Vic. women lawyers are now a full cricket
team. Myra Merfield, 8.A., LL.B., makes

“B. Bovvyang”: This is the story of Djemal
Pasha, late Turkish Governor of Palestine,
as it came to me from the neighbors of four
of his victims, villagers of Duran. A
farmer’s wife was noted for her beauty.
Her two daughters, 15 and 18, also possessed
the mother’s good looks. Djemal Pasha,
visiting Duran in the early days of the war,
caught sight of the family, and the follow-
ing day had the farmer arrested and sen-
tenced him to be shot the next morning on
a charge of supplying information to the
British. A message was sent to the wife
informing her that if she allowed Djemal to
visit her that night the husband would be
released. To save her husband—well, you
can guess the rest. Before leaving the dis-
honored house the beast stated that the
prisoner would be released almost immedi-
ately; but crossing over to the compound
he ordered the man to be shot at once. He
was taking no chances with an infuriated
father.
Colebatch, M.L.C., unable to find a sure
seat in the Westralian Assembly, has passed
the Premiership on to .Mitchell. Morgans
was Premier for 32 days; but Colebatch now
holds the record for suddenness. In Mor-
ass’s year (1901) Westralia had five Mini-
stries; and that is a record which is likely
to stand. For all Australia Andy Dawson’s

six-day Queensland Ministry in 1889, with
Andrew Fisher as Minister for Works, beat
Earle’s Tasmanian Ministry of 1909 by one
day (that was when Jans August Jensen got
his first taste of office) ; and Sudden Solo-
mon (S.A.) tied with Earle. Neither N. S.
Wales nor Vic. have ever shown the same
turn of speed. Dibbs’s 50 days in 1889 still
stands as the Ma State’s best; and Vic-
toria’s is Elmslie’s 13 days in 1913.
“Mr. James’s” N. S. Wales estate pays
probate duty on £558,000, which suggests
that the head wasn’t niggardly towards the
rest of the Fairfax family during his life.
The widow gets £6OOO a year ; and the S. M.
Herald interests are divided pretty equally
between five children. Apparently G.
E. and J. O. were “provided for” when they
were admitted as partners in the old John
Fairfax and Sons firm; so they don’t share
in the distribution of the estate outside the
Herald.
Chief Justice Griffith, who at 74 is said
to have handed in his resignation, never
believed in “sleeping on it.” If he had
a reserved decision to come to he came to it
before he finished his day’s work, even
though it meant reading and chewing it
over until 2 o’clock next morning.
Flume Cook, general sec. (£1250 a year)
of the Vic. National Federation, has quar-
relled with the executive over methods of
administration, and a, new man is being
sought for the job. The versatile Cook got
into the limelight of the A.N.A. 25 years
ago. Then he became one of the members
for East Bourke Boroughs in the State
Assembly. “Kernel” Reay shifted him.
Next he induced Bourke electorate to give
him an innings in the House of Reps.
Deakin took him into one of his Govern-
ments (1908) as an Honorary. But the
electors dropped him, and until a little while
ago he was identified with co-operative fruit-
growing and selling.
Septimus Burt, K.C., acknowledged leader
of the Bar in Westralia. died at Perth on
May 15. Born in the West Indies in 1547,
he was the seventh son of Archibald Burt,
afterwards Chief Justice of Westralia. He
was in the old Leg. Council for some years,
and when Bigjohn formed his first Ministry
under Responsible Government, Burt natu-
rally became Attorney-General. He might
have gone on the bench again and again;
but he couldn’t sacrifice his fine income—
one of the best at the Australian Bar.
As a Queensland politician Chief Justice
Griffith put up the record of having been at
some time or other in charge of every Depart-
ment except Lands and Mines. He was
Premier, Treasurer, Attorney-General, In-
struction, Works, Chief Secretary, and Post-
master-General. Even Bob Philp can’t
equal that, although he was at various
times Treasurer, Works, Mines, Railways
and Instruction in one (the Nelson) Min-
istry.

P erth’s to p-n o! eh chess-
players ; but the game hasn’t
made him a tactician. In
the late trouble with the Fre-
mantle lumpers he spoiled his
chances with three opening
blunders. (Move 1) He told
the Labor leaders there was
nothing but blank cartridges
in his rifles. Of course the
good news got round in no time.
(Move 2) Of all days he chose
Sunday to commence opera-
tions, when all laborites are
free and ready to shy stones
even at a goat. (Move 3) He
sent along only 158 constables.
Alec McCallum, the Labor boss,
doesn’t play chess; but his tac-

Premier.
The Fowler potteries in Syd-
ney have been passed on to a
limited liability co., with a
capital of £lOO,OOO. Enoch
Fowler, the founder of the busi-
ness, commenced in a very small
way 80 years ago in what was
then Parramatta-street, near the
Newtown-road. Later, the busi-
ness was moved out to Camperdown, along-
side the old toll-bar. One of Enoch’s sons,
Robert, was Mayor of Sydney in 1880 and
M.L.A. for the Phillip Division in 1894-95.
But the useful family has mostly stuck to
its clay.
Passed out in the West, Dick Sholl, a
good sport and for many years Postmaster-
General. He joined the Postal Department
in 1863, when a boss, three adult assistants
and two boys comprised the Perth staff, and
when the mails were wheeled round the
town on a barrow for delivery. He became
chief clerk in 1873, and 16 years later was
appointed P.M.G. with a staff of 200 in
Perth and nearly 800 in the country. He
hung on to the job for three years after
Federation arrived and then retired on a
pension. For years he took an active
interest in the W.A.T.C., and was on the
committee when he died.
Sid Emanuel, another “cattle king,” died
in London on April 27. Sid was a son
of a Goulburn storekeeper who once sat in
the N.S.W. Assembly. With his brother he
went to the West in 1881 and did a lot of
hard pioneering in Kimberley. Their for-
tunes were made by 1894, and soon after
that they came to Perth and with the late
Alex. Forrest started business as stock and
station agents and owners. In partnership
with his brother he raced a number of horses,
including Annapolis, Mousme and Prophecy.
Flight-Lieut. Lawrence Kay, an Anzac
who reached Melbourne the other day after
more than four years’ service, holds his war-
record, too. He is the only Australian who
ever survived a 200 ft. “crash.” Kay’s bump
was due to engine-trouble, and he had a bad
time before he pulled round.

HERBERT
HAYES ,
M.H.A.,
Hon. Minister
of Tasmania.
Horace Rounsevell, who has just died at
52, was Adelaide-born and bred, but prac-
tised law at Kalgoorlie in the early days in
partnership with Andrew Henning, one of
the framers of the Australian Constitution.
Returning to Adelaide, he was in partner-
ship with Josiah ttymon till his health broke
down. He was one of the most genial and
popular of his profession.
Gone to press at 55, Alf Ellis Riley, edi-
tor and part-owner of Goulburn (N.S.W.)
Herald. He had been on the staff of thb
paper since his schooldays—was a younger
son of its previous editor, and a good fellow.
“The Happy Historian”: The recently-
executed Budd was the cheerfulest prisoner
tried in Adelaide of recent times, and he
even offered odds in gaol that he would
dodge the hangman. There have been other
gay gallows-birds in days gone by. When
Judge Stow pronounced a death sen-
tence his solemn “and may the Lord have
mercy on your soul” was followed by the
prisoner’s cheerful “And on yours too, old
boy.” But perhaps the sportiest on record
anywhere was Heaslip, a London burglar,
who, on receiving five years, made the Judge
a fair offer for winding the thing up—“l’ll
toss you 10 years or nothing.”
Brig.-General “Bert” Lloyd, just returned
in the Shropshire, is the youngest brass-hat
of that rank in the A.1.F., being only 35.
But he started young, being born in Victoria
Barracks.
The Ist Light Horse was on parade one
day receiving the final touches before the
Landing, when a band in the vicinity struck
up “Auld Lang Syne.” Colonel Meredith,
the troop’s famous leader, sprang to the
salute. Noticing, however, that an officer
near by was “standing easy,” he asked what
about it. “Pardon me, sir,” said the accused,
“but that is not the National Anthem.”
“Well, well, well!” chuckled the old
warrior. “All these tunes are the worry
of my life.”
Redmond Barry’s house is still standing
in Melbourne, tucked away in a corner off
Bourke-street and hidden by Goldsbrough
Mort’s big building, and so is the mulberry
tree under which he sat of a summer even-
ing and handed out improving literature to
visitors before he got busy with the founding
of the Melbourne Public Library. The
house has been deserted for many years, and
it is not as clean as it might be, for the
derelicts left by the land boom used to doss
m it in the hungry times of the ’nineties.
Dark suspicions that these Germans are a
two-faced crowd are confirmed bv a leader
m Melbourne Herald, which says: “From
his chair immediately behind Ra'ntzau. Mr.
Murdoch was able to see every line of the
Prussian’s face.”
Splendid old Clemenceau, who repeatedly
risked his life when visiting the anny, has
got a Croix de Guerre. A poilu has sent
it to him with this letter: “You have not
been given the Croix de Guerre, so here is
mine. It is all I have to offer you.” The
oM “Tiger” doesn’t mind a bit admitting that
this was one of the times during the war
when he couldn’t keep the tears back.
TREKKING SOUTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“AVe are leaving- Tripoli for Beruit, and large num-
bers of the native inhabitants line the roads,
mourning and bewailing our departure.... Many are
loth to lose sight of us, and though we are several
miles along the road we can still see children and
weeping women following the column.”
AA'hile ragged folk are grouping
In squalid lane and street,
The sun is pale, and drooping
The languid sea to meet,
And far away a bugle sounds
The passionate retreat.
' Farewell, poor dame and maiden.
Whom Fate long frowned upon,
Though olive trees were laden
When dew damp pastures shone,
And sunlight kissed the snowy peaks
Of hoary Lebanon!
A r our hearts this day are aching
AA'ith empty, dumb remorse;
AVhen clouds of war were breaking
AA : e greeted you in force;
But we must now bo taking
The charted homeward course.
Long years you'll sure remember
The great Australian cheer
That sang the spent December
Into a calmer year ;
The men who taught you to be brave
And bade you cease to fear.
You blessed our youthf: 1 nation
AVhen we came riding through
To halve our scanty ration
And share our meat with you—
We leave you, for the work is done
That Billjim came to do.
Oh, Billjim won the heart of
A starved and ragged race:
lie ever took the part of
The soul with wrinkled face —
But who will come to Lebanon
To fill his vacant place?
He brought the people gladness
Till they forgot their plight,
And hov’ring wings of sadness
Had wholly taken flight;
But he must saddle up, for he
Is riding south to-night.
So, good-bye sage and stripling
And children of the poor ;
AVe hear child-laughter rippling
Outside the Syrian’s door—
Alas, the tears that fall within
Upon the earthen floor!
The sun a moment lingers
To grace the tide of eve,
On mountain-snow deft fingers
Their magic patterns weave;
But hearts that we had taught to laugh
Have learned thp way to grieve.

There is nothing like having a good
library to fall back on. A patient in the
Broken Hill Hospital was lately having her
spine sponged with methylated spirits. One
of the institution’s 45 nurses left off the
sponging for a minute to light a match in
order to get a better view of the lady. Un-
fortunately, the lady caught fire; and then,
after she had died, some inquisitive members
of the committee asked questions about the
little accident. That was where the benefit
of the good library came in ; for the doctor-
superintendent assured the committee that,
having read up an old treatment for the in-
flammable lady’s disease, he found that a
hundred years ago they used to slightly burn
patients suffering- from this lady’s disease,
that the patient in this case had improved
after the regrettable accident, and that “the
drastic treatment no doubt prolonged the
patient’s life for three days.” Still the
committee seemed to have a doubt whether
even a medical library could be depended
upon to supply evidence that grilling was
good for every sort of patient; so it gravely
resolved that instructions be issued that
matches mustn’t be struck to examine pati-
ents with in future.
Still another collier, the Tuggerah, has
gone to the bottom while making for Syd-
ney—the third within a few months; and
as with the others there was a bad loss of
life. As usual the apology is offered
of mountainous seas. But, as on at
least one of the other occasions, the only
boat launched was able not only to reach
shore, but also to pull around the vicinity
for some time. It has been left for the
Labor party to demand a “strict inquiry.”
It doesn’t do the other parties any good
that they should sit back and say they sup-
pose it can’t be helped. Such things have
yot to be helped.

“Bouragi”: My sympathy goes out to the
unhappy sheriff of Victoria who nearly had
to do his own scragging (B. 15/5/T9).
Years ago, when I was deputy-sheriff of the
Northern Division of British New Guinea,
a native cookie who had murdered his white
boss was due for suspension. As many of
the miners on the Gira had announced that
they were only too willing to turn off the
blank who had murdered their mate, I made
no definite arrangement for an executioner
till the day before. Then, when I walked
into Billy Hancock’s store, where all hands
were met for to-morrow’s show, and called
upon any one of the dozen volunteers, I was
met with a frozen silence. Pleadings and
blasphemy were useless. After an interval
for refreshment, I selected the least asinine
of my native police, and, with the aid of a
bag of rice, rehearsed the stunt till mid-
night. The bag with a rope fastened round
its neck was hoisted up to a beam by a
rope under its armpits. Then the Iviwai
policeman, who sat on the beam, would cut
rope No. 2 with a tomahawk and the bag
would drop, till brought up by the neck-
rope with a thud. The Governor and his
staff attended the final performance, which
literally went with a swing. I remember
that the Treasurer subsequently tried to
make me pay for the fathoms of new rope
cut up in the course of the rehearsals.
“The Crushed Curate”: Australia’s first
church was run up at a cost of £67 12s.
llld., according to a claim for reimburse-
ment put in by Richard Johnson, the
chaplain, and dated September 4, 1793. Of
this £59 18s. was paid in Span-
ish dollars and the rest in kind
—2Ol gallons of spirits (dear,
dear!). 1161 b. of flour. 18£lb. of
pork, 3311 b. of beef, 31b. of to-
bacco and 51b. of tea. In for-
warding the claim Licut.-Gov-
ernor Grose complained that the
charge was a great deal more
than the church ought to have
cost, and that, anyway, Johnson
was one of the people called
Methodists and a very trouble-
some, discontented character
who should not be encouraged.
Johnson’s little bill hung fire till January,
1797, when payment was authorised. Ten
months later someone burnt the tabernacle.
“Billy T.” : The last home of Bohemian-
ism in Melbourne was a little, tumbled, vine-
clad cottage the other side of Fitzroy Gar-
dens. Here resided two or three young
artists who have since made an indelible
mark, and with them one or two casuals in
the literary line, and a musician who sub-
scribed to the conventions to the extent of
submitting to a monthly haircut. Tney were
a happy family. Their furniture was mostlv
an amazing aggregation of professional wares
and collapsible chairs, their idea being
never to possess anything that would be of
any value to anybody else on Gott’s earth.
To this raffish household went a stealthy
wretch in the dark of the night, pawing the
sacred possessions, seeking something worth
thieving. It was Percy Lindsay who cap-
tured the intruder. “So help me Heaven.”
lie gasped, “a burglar!” The others awoke.
The small horn-blower got up, surveyed the
house-breaker by the pale light of a wooden
match, and stole out. The rest united :n
kicking the rash adventurer off the px-emises
and some distance down the road. When
they returned they found the small horn-
hlower trying on a very serviceable pair of
shoes. “Vot did you get?” he asked. “I
haf his boots!”

“D.”: An Australian Guards Regiment?
God forbid! The Guards in peace-time
(English, Irish, Scotch and Welsh) are
quartered in London—with the exception
of a handful which does duty at Windsor.
They are essentially ornamental. There
are few' more tragically ludicrous sights than
a trooper in the Life Guards sitting mounted
in his box at Whitehall, clad in about £l5O
worth of tinware and feathers. And the
further the world gets from militarism and

monarchism the more out of place such
spectacles must become. Every Guards
officer is required to have a minimum private
income of £5OO a year; and in practice not
one in a hundred was able to live on that
before the war. The Guards have no mess;
the. officers live mostly with their families
or in rooms in St. James’s, where, inciden-
tally, the cost of living has gone up from 75
to 100 per cent, in the past five years. The
lives of most of them are divided between
“society” and expensive sport—chiefly racing,
hunting and polo. No considerable number
of good .Australian officers would tolerate
such a life. Yet if they lived otherwise
there would be a distinction between them
and the other officers of the Brigade which
would be unbearable. There is only one
justification for reinforcing the famous
Brigade with Anzacs—that trouble is ex-
pected on the London front. And that is
a possibility which can be met without de-
populating Australia of its best.

a hole like that through the Alps. They
knew of a better way. through Cannibal
Gorge, where the tunnels would have been
briefer and the grades much better. Some-
one must have pulled a string somewhere.
“Dry Shave” : Yes, the ’flu flea has bitten
them badly in the country. I’ve seen a man
ploughing in a paddock 15 miles from the
nearest pub, wearing a mask. But the in-
considerate fellow had forgotten to muzzle

recalls a night at Allonville ’drome after we
had just started a spell-oh and when the
Brig, and his intelligence-officer took the
stage during a Digger pierrot show. TTn-
umbering his dry Captain Ivettle grin, he
bellowefl, “Well, I suppose you fellows want
the oil?’ “Yes!” roared the boys, and the
ones towards the back yelled. “Carry on.

‘My intelligence chap here,” jerking a thumb
at him, “tells me the 15th and 13th Brigades
with a Tommy Brigade mopped up a thous-
and Iluns at Villers-Bretonneux to-day.”
(Joyous uproar.) “Now you fellows know
what happens” (the bomb came with the
pm out) “when one brigade gets tired.
Its replaced by a fresher one!” “Stung!”
yelled the warriors—“the flaming spell’s a
gutzer, and we’re off up again!” Then thev
turned round and cheered him for his nerve.

THE DEVIL DANCERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hi'. Henry, Melbourne’s latest actor-evangelist, is
out to smash the dance. Lecturing on “The Wild
Leasts of Civilisation” the other night, he said: “To
me there is only one thing worse than the theatre,
and that is the modern dance. It is the meanest
and slimiest thing that has crept out of Hell.”
The dance it is a leprous thing.
Its sinuosities
Suggest the serpent, and its fling
The carrion-eating vulture’s wing.
On every hand one sees
The lowly wretches it has dragged
From heights angelic to be bagged
By Mephistopheles.
When presently the liquor fiend
Is wiped right out of view,
When of the pubs the earth is cleaned,
And all the brethren are weaned
From Bung’s infernal brew,
We’ll send united praise on high,
And having got the public dry
We’ll have ’em rigid too.
The wicked wretch who dares to dance
Will feel our righteous heat;
The man or woman seen to prance
In any sort of circumstance
With scorpions we’ll beat.
The sins of head, and and hand
Being exorcised, we’ll put our brand
On sinning with the feet!
VICTORIA.

An Adelaide examining counsel got the
jolt of his life the other day. “Isn’t it
a fact,” he asked a female witness whose
credibility he was impugning—"isn’t it a
fact that some years ago you derived quite
a nice little income from frequenting the
pavement?” For reply she rapped out 1

“Hamer”: To the home-coming Digger
Australia is. the land of promises. We were
informed in England—it; appeared in
orders —that every returning soldier before
lie disembarked in Australia would be
handed a brand-new uniform, color-patches
and all, to make a decent showing on leave.
There was even a special order that all
c.o. s in charge of transports were to -see
that sumcient color-patches were provided
tor issue to the men on board. But we saw
nothing of either new uniforms or color-
patches, and landed in our old weatherbeaten
duds. It doesn’t matter much, of course:
but as an example of the way in which pro-
mises are kept it is not encouraging. This
new uniform issue was widely advertised in
the .London papers as an example of the
generous fashion in which returning Austra-
lians were being treated.
HER COMMERCIAL EDUCATION.
"Oh, I say, if know, if a fellah didn’t enlist
it doesn’t say he’s a coward. You might
give Of chap credit, for having some man-
hood.”
"Well, you see, I took a job in a bank, and
note I don’t give credit unless the fel-
lah gives security.”
"Dial Sight”: The statement that the
Maoriland soldier’s anti-Prohibition vote
was influenced by his recollection of the
French inns shows that good old Enzed has
a sense of gratitude. I will never forget
the elongated inn stove which straddled out
on the tiled floor of every front bar. Around
it half-frozen Diggers jostled for positions,
or lounged in comfort watching the coffee
brewing in its long-handled pot while Mad-
ame Vanblong juggled with a small reservoir
of “erfs au cheeps.” The liquor didn’t call
tor much eulogy; but there wer-e times, when
the boys would have lapped up sea- water fb
get alongside one of those stoves.
Thurston Hogarth,
superintendent of the
Melbourne Institute
for the Blind, has been
explaining how it is
that the fine concert-
hall. containing a
piano and pipe-organ
given by the late
Francis Ormond, is
used as a store-room
instead of for the
pleasuring of the In-
stitute vv orke r s.
There are grounds at
the asylum large
enough to allow tor
half-a-dozen factories
and stores; but one
after the other Gov-
ernments have post-
poned giving the
necessary permission
to build, with the re-
sult that the concert-
hall has for years
housed furniture and
brushware instead of
blind audiences. Blind
people are not slow in
voicing their griev-
ances, real or imagi-
ary ; and it is not hard
to imagine the bitter
talk there is among
these handicapped
workers, shut off from
enjoyment of the
movies and such cheap
pleasures, and toiling
slowly at piecework
for a poor wage. With
an open hall, volun-
teer entertainers
w o u 1 d attend in
plenty.
“Country Ped”: Vic. Education Depart-
ment should include sweating in it's Training
College course. The head teacher of a
school of 800 pupils is allotted £5O per year
for maintenance. Out of this he has to buy
all ink and chalk used, and pay a sanitary
rate and sometimes a water
rate as well. He also has to
buy wood, and pay for the
cleaning of the school. Doing
his best, all he can allot the
. cleaner is ’.l2s. a week for
sweeping and dusting daily six
or seven large rooms full of
dual desks that have to be
shifted every time the room is
swept. Bu.t that’s not all.
Spouting and tanks must be
kept clean, and there is no
money left for that job. So a
district inspector was not sur-
prised when he lately found a
headmaster up a big ladder do-
ing the plumber’s job.
“Haka”: The Maoriland
Scot is a hard doer. The war-
had hardly been announced
when the Sandies down Bal-
clutha way insisted on a pro-
posal .to export all the worn-out
nags in the district as food for
hungry Europeans. Massey
told McPheerson .that He would
see him in the heatworks before
he would sanction the State-
export brand being affixed to
any horse-meat. McFreeze has
not repented, however. Last
month he inserted a notice in
the local sheet that, owing to
the stock sale in Balclutha,
Anzac Day could not be recog-
msed in any way. Having
, gone to the sale and secured
’’r Ixl,l a llead his skinny merinos,
McGramte rang the firebell and the town
repaired to the kirk to pray for those who
voted against prohibeetion.

When a Taube dropped its good-morning
salute and a fragment hit Big Mick at Eaffa,
they carried him unconscious to a tent at
El Arish for an operation. When he came-
to he glanced to the right and saw an
orderly. Then he glanced to the left and
saw another. Then he glanced through
the flap of the tent and saw sand. After
which he ground his teeth and groaned:
“Missed it again ! Still in Egypt!”

“The Happy Historian”: 'Flu panic

pened to help him bury the first plague
victim. lie then had to remain in quaran-
tine or accept a billet burying other victims.
He decided to stick to the job, and did,
right through the plague' period, calling with
a vehicle at the houses where deaths had
occurred, placing the bodies in shells, and
helping to wrap the shells in fiercely-dis-
infected sheets. The undertakers wore no
masks and took nothing but six whiskies a
day for precaution.
“Gypo”: We were dreadfully busy, and
Private Wirefence failed to salute the usual
Tommy one-pipper. The youngster stopped
him and let him know that lie was dirt.
Salute you, you b !” said the
Aussie. Of course One Pip called up an
M.P. and told him about it. “Well, are
you one, sir?” he asked. Of course he
wasn’t. “Then,” said the M.P., “I tell you
what—you call him a liar, and let him
get on with his job.”
“Oculist”: “J- Kasee” got out of his
depth, ophthalmologically speaking, by assert-
ing in a recent Bulletin that the correction
of optical errors is foreign to the domain of
medicine. Nearly all of the commoner
diseases of the eyes, such as sties, sore lids
and the various forms of conjunctivitis, can
be traced to an uncorrected error of refrac-
tion ; and it is high time the man in the
street was acquainted with this. A patient
with sore eyes is usually content to spend a
'Pflrt of his time in bathing his eves
with lotions, when all he wants is proper
g asses. Many hundreds of our soldiers
ar * bem S dosed with bromides and other
drugs for war-neurasthenia, shell-shock and
other bodily and mental ills, when all they
need is the close attention of the expert re-
fractionist, who will find that an astigmatism
perhaps very slight in amount, and which
caused no symptoms whatever when the pati-
ent Avas leading a normal existence, has now
become troublesome owing to the conditions
ot hte in the trenches, and the anxieties of
the last few years. In war-neurasthenia
and shell-shock, the soldier has been drained
ol a great deal of his nerve-energy, and his
suffering and discomfort will be increased by
the waste of nerve energy through his eyes,
m. ie iave a neglected error of refraction.
Ihe treatment adopted in these cases in
some London hospitals consists in simple
bandaging of the eyes—a proceeding which
has been followed by marked improve-
ment in many sufferers. Eye-strain, on
the other hand, may not be the sole cause
ot the patient's symptoms, but it is fre-
quently a chief cause, and the prescribing of
appropriate glasses by a skilled refraction-
-Ist will very much aid other methods of
treatment. These remarks will serve to
show how necessary it is that the returning
soldier whose nervous system is below par
should be given a thorough overhaul of his
visual organs. Incidentally it puts out. of
bounds the contention that' refraction work
isn'l a medical subject.
“J.T.M.” : We had just come out of the line,
and the marks of battle were still upon us.
At. short notice we were paraded to receive
the usual guff from “Birdie.” On these
occasions lie mostly promised us a spell, but
Ibis time he didn’t reach that stage. "Boys,”
he began, “I have come to thank you for
your magnificent work. You have been
through Hell, but you have added further
glory to your name. Don’t think of what
you have suffered, but of what you have
achieved ! We are driving back the armies
of the Hun ! See those hills that were his
a few days ago? They are ours! See
those advanced balloons? They are ours!
See those ’planes? They are oh no I

off our clothes we saw a staff car doing (JO

Batman : The grievance of “An Infantry
Officer in Belgium” (B. 8/5/19) doesn’t
touch my heart. The complaining i.o. was
among the officers told to dump all their sur-
plus clothes at Meteren in order that the
divisions could travel “light” in the push to
Amiens, and in the subsequent advance of the
enemy in the north the dump was burned.
The grievance is that compensation for lost
kits has not been granted to Australian offi-
cers, but has been granted to British officers.
It sounds genuine, but this is the position.
Officers, like their men, were supposed to
go to the front as “light” as possible, and
theie are orders to that effect in existence •
but, following the bad example of the British
Army, some_ Australian officers got into the
habit of taking over all sorts of fancy goods.
Bome_ of them travelled to the front like
American millionaires on tour. It meant a
jot of extra work for the men, much growl-
mg and a loss of mobility and efficiencv.
After the kit losses occurred the Australian
officers who complained were told that they

would be compensated in respect of such
tilings as were absolutely essential and were
sanctioned by regulations. As for the rest
it things were taken in defiance of regulations’
it was the officer’s own funeral. That was
the right attitude. The fact that British
officers icere compensated merely shows the
rotten system in the British army There

SAYS DYSPEPTICS NEED MORE
MAGNESIA.
TAKE A LITTLE BISURATED MAG-
NESIA IN HOT WATER IMMEDIATELY
AFER EATING, AND ENJOY HEARTY
MEALS WITHOUT DISTRESS.
If people who suffer more or less con-
stantly after meals with acid indigestion or
dyspepsia, sourness, gas, bloating, etc., would
make a practice of taking half a teaspoonful
of bisurated magnesia in a quarter glass of
hot water after eating they would soon put
an end to all fear of stomach trouble. For
bisurated magnesia, mixing with the digesting
food and stomach juices, promptly and effec-
tively sweetens all excess acid, prevents fer-
mentation and souring of food and insures
normal and painless digestion. Get a bottle
of bisurated magnesia from the nearest chem-
ist and try it and see. It is harmless to the
stomach and inexpensive. For stomach pur-
poses be sure and get bisurated magnesia
rather than magnesia in other forms, as this
is specially prepared for neutralising stomach
acidity. —Advt.. (

Sutton Granger”: Bumped up against
Digger Waterfield, of the 15th Battalion, one night
in a favorite haunt just off the Wazzir, in Cairo. He
was expounding his ability to undress jumbucks, and
was being ardently backed up by Billjim in general.
“Cor’ bli’me,” quoth he, “I can peel ’em all right.”
We said we’d bet he could. He began to enthuse.
“Strike me,” he said; “when I was at Burrawang
in 1906 I pelted ’em down th’ blanky chute so fast
it looked as if they was playing leapfrog. I’ll
show yer! ” Grabbing an empty beer bottle to act
as a substitute for the clippers, he glared round for a
suitable jumbuck. He picked a black one. It hap-
pened to be an incautious, over-inquisitive Gyppo
paper-boy. Digger grabbed the unfortunate native
by a hind leg and brought him to the floor. With
tile dexterity of long practice, the “sheep” was
dumped into a sitting posture and gripped between
the shearer’s legs. The imaginary top-gear was siting
into motion, and Digger started down the neck in
professional style. The jumbuck ba-a-a-ed and
squirmed, and was promptly rapped on the snout
with the “machine.” This drastic measure had the
effect of quietening the animal till the belly wool
was taken off and the first shoulder peeled. With

lightning speed Abdul was whirled into position, and
the enthusiastic operator commenced on the “long
blow.” His right knee was jambed into the unfor-
tunate sheep’s tummy, forcing yells of anguish from
the suffering follower of Mahomet. The merino
started to kick and struggle again, but was instantly
brought to realise the futility of his efforts by
another bat on the side of the head with the bog-eye,
simultaneous with a vicious bump in his commis-
sariat department from the artist’s knee. The long-
blow finished, Digger jerked the perspiring, half-
crazed Si-eeda into a sitting posture by the left ear,
the machine flashed around the head, over the last
shoulder, down the “whipping side,” along the hind
leg and cleared round the tail; the ringer slung the
imaginary pulley cut of gear, propelled the finished
article under a table, and glared round for his next.
There wasn’t another within a radius of half a mile,
so Digger captured the nearest pint and drank long
and deep, while a naked, badly-scared son of the
Faithful burned a track through the atmosphere in
the direction of Mecca. Digger's time, lmin. 35rjsec.

west of X. S. Wales. To visit his flock it was
necessary to travel from Monday morning till Friday.
One night he lost the track and made for a distant
light in what proved to be a boundary-rider's hut. A
woman answered his call, and she and the boss willingly
agreed to put him up for the night, provided that
he didn t mind sharing the boss’s bed. After a good
supper the lost sheep went to bunk, being soon fol-
lowed by the boss. Half an hour later the bedroom
door was gently opened, and the Rev. Tonald heard

Dear Fellow”: Fowl-fanciers whose pets
will lay at the wrong season might get a hint from

world m the Betsy, which left New York in 1797 to
seal .in the South Seas and then go on to China,
Fanning says that he gathered a lot of penguin eggs
at the Falkland Islands and kept them good for nine
months by first dipping them in seal-oil and then
packing therft in a barrel with dry sand—a layer of
sand and then a layer of eggs. Like Douglas Maw-
son who reckons that a big business might be
worked up in them, Fanning speaks of penguin
eggs as first-class tucker. Mawson’s idea, however
runs more to powdered egg and egg extract. ’

He supposes there are 5000 in S. Aus. and 100,000

are what the doctor chiefly claims for them The
veteran Simpson Newland derided the idea of the
State that Binghi could be made into a farmer.
Large and strictly-protected reserves are his claim.
J.O attempt to Christianise the natives was pretty
and nice, but the first thing should be to give them

Scientists would now be coming from all over the

for the tribes about the far-north Mac Donnell
Ranges, as being “smart, keen and useful with
stock.” Peake, Premier of S.A., agreed with nearly
everything that had been said, and promised to get
into touch with the Commonwealth Government
with the object of having the question taken up in

Jim Carew : The now almost extinct
ceratodus, or Burnett salmon, or lung-fish is the
most remarkable fish Australia has, ranking in im-
portance with the ant-eater and the platvpus In
appearance a ceratodus is a long black fish with a
light-colored belly. The scales on top are extra
large, the tail is like an eel’s, and there are two fins
on either side of the body. The fish’s most fre-
quented resorts are large, deep pools containing big
boulders. He is extremely hardy, will live for hours
out of water, and if wrapped in a wet sack can be
kept alive for days. The ceratodus is not, when
fresh, a table delicacy, as the flesh is rather coarse,
but when smoked or dried it is No. 1 tucker. For
years scientists were unable to discover much about
the ceratodi, as no ova could be found, but in 1892
Professor Semon, with the aid of a tribe of Binghis
collected a quantity of ova, and had it hatched in
England. In 98 four specimens were taken to Eng-
land two of which were sold to the Zoological
Society and the other two in France. The species
grows to about 6ft. in length, and can now only be

a dozen oysters, and feel satisfied that lie would find a pearl to pay his bill with.”
Parliament yet. Some of the burrows extend 4ft.
deep and have ramifications like a catacomb, and all
manner of exits and ventilation holes. It often
takes two days to dig out one clan, and when the
work is finished the place looks like a battle-field in
Belgium. The Government says it can’t attempt to
extirpate bunny on reserves, stock-routes and pub-
lic lands, so when the small private land-holder tries
to wipe them, out his place is promptly re-stocked.
The new rabbit climbs over fences or burrows under
them even if they go down 4ft., or eats through
them. He has learned a lot.
S.S.S. ’: Each night on the lone range in
Papua where I lived awhile myriads of moths
fluttered into my grass-house. There was one milk-
white and as big as my two hands. I called it
“Lilith.” And a wee rose-red thing with peacock-
blue antennae I named “That Hat,” after a top-
piece I once saw in Bond-street, London. A leaf-
green loveliness that posed and pirouetted I chris-
tened “La Coryphee,” and a big gold beauty edged
with sable reminded me of Sara Bernhardt. Of them
all “Old Nile” was my best-beloved. Small she
was and still; feathered in buff and bronze and
underclothed in flame. A big, multi-colored moth, a
pompous and urbane person, slow and gracious in
his comings and goings, and perfectly polite, I
used to call “Staniforth S.” And you all know who
he is.
Pass out “Bison” (B. 24/4/T9),
who declares that most animals travel better against
the wind than with it. I’ve had years of experience
with horses, and always found that they prefer to go
with the breeze. On a long trip nothing will raise
the “Bolsh” spirit amongst a team so readily as a
brisk head wind. Air on the hurry from the direc-
tion of the caravan’s destination raises as much dust
as atmosphere on the scoot from the rear, whilst
from the latter the horse's body protects his head.
I set out from Booligal for Hay (N.S.W.), 50 miles
of level road, and for five hours we plugged along
against a disagreeable wind in our face and made
about 25 miles. Camped for a couple of hours and
started again, this time with the wind blowing from
the opposite direction, and covered the remaining 25
miles in three hours.
“Wandi”: Catching black duck with fish-
ing-lines is a common resort of travellers when camp-
ing at a waterhole. Ducks travel about at night
visiting small holes that are not safe places in day-
time, and the fisherman prepares a welcome before
sundown. His line is thrown across a selvage of
weeds, watercress or lily-leaves, so that the hook
baited with grasshopper, cricket or shrimp, hangs just
5® l UteT 6dge - A Very small hook is used, so
that the bird can swallow it, and the line must be
, Ight f nd str ° ng - 7 er y of ten a strong pin or needle
(the latter being bent by heating it) acts as well
as an ordinary hook.
(B.T™ with *‘We«l^
have no fear of man until been warned bv
their parents that he is not to l e trusted I’ve put
in a good deal of time trying to tame black-duck
fledglings, and my experience has been that, the
moment they were at liberty they would concentrate
on getting away. Any movement near them set them
lying flat, beak and neck along the ground, motion-
less till they thought the coast was clear, and then
a stealthy creep away, if not to liberty at least to
concealment. My birds either got away or died
early. The young bustard is even wilder than tin
duck, while young quail and plover will take cover
before their down is dry from the egg. Some years
ago, at Noondoo station (Q.), a black boy brought
in four dingo puppies he had found in a hollow log.
Their eyes were just open and the little chaps were
so fat they could barely crawl. He put them o:i
the path of the station garden while he was talkin'”
to me, and ip less time than it takes to write this
they had hauled themselves laboriously under a
thick bush near by. Brought out to the' open, they
did this time after time.
CONSOLATION.
THE PARSON: “Well, Mr. Hayseed, I come
to condole with you on the loss of your
wife. She teas a fine woman."
HAYSEED: “Yairs, it’s sad, all right. Still,
she was a lit light for a farmer's wife!"
“Wombat”: Even the amiable wombat has
enemies. Be deblock farmers in Gippsland
allege that he pushes through or grubs under wire-
netting fences, and lets the imported-rabbit curae
through. So they want a Government bonus of 10s.
for each wombat scalp; but the chances are they
won’t get it.

§
‘*Te TV hare”: Re ‘‘Pick’s” assertion (B.
24/4/’19.) that you can’t drown a snake. Although
the squirmers will exist for a considerable time
under water, they die of suffocation when the air-
suppiy contained in (I think) a sac in the body is
exhausted. Of those which are carried into the sea
by floods only a small percentage survive. Some
snakes, such as the black devil, are good swimmers
jk n d divers. The tiger is the reverse. I have
watched the tigers take somewhat reluctantly to the
SEEKING BIBLICAL INSTRUCTION.
PADRE: “You seem to he having trouble , my lad. Can I help you?”
DIGGER: "Yes, you can, Padre. Can you tell me kow in blazes Noah got mules on
board the Ark?"
water and swim with a feeble, wriggling motion
perhaps 50 to 100 yards. The black snake is won-
derfull.v at home in the water. i have seen him
occasionally, intent on frog, lying loosely on the
surface and remaining so for a very long time. I
have timed a brown snake under water for 20min„
but even that was no record. It is a fact, however,
that when any snake, including the black, is dis-
turbed, and takes refuge in a pool of water, it is
not long before the nostrils and from a quarter to
half-an-inch of head come gently to the surface, and
the reptile remains in this position until it is again
driven below. A keen Banana land snakologist, P
Bennett, informs the writer that in black snakes
dissected by him he found the left lung atrophied
and useless. Anything having lungs is, I think
capable of drowning. The smellful black ant is just
as hard to drown as a snake. After floods, colonies
of him, quite unconcerned, may be dug up in dead
log-s which have been buried feet deep in mud. If
left to himself he calmly waits till the mud gets
perfectly dry, and then tunnels through it and circles
around in the same idiotic manner as he did before
the Deluge.
* * * *
“A. Sinclair”: Let me implore “Cycle” (B.
24/4/’l9) to give me the recipe for “schooling and
driving’ wild pigs (in a mob, I presume) a distance
of 20-odd miles. I was at one time in the wild-
swine industry at Goondiwindi (Q.), and struck the
happy idea of “schooling” them. With a yard of 50
I began my experiment by rubbing them down with
a bag on the end of a long stick (colt-fashion),
tickling their ribs with my fingers and feeding them
well. At the end of 10 days I concluded that they
would hang together for a walk. When I opened the
gate the scatter was like a handful of marbles being
thrown on the ground. In two minutes there was
not a pig to be seen and even the smell had departed.
Carting is the surest way to get them to market, and
they’re hardly worth it.
“Veronal”: Met that somewhat rare and
cormorant-like fowl, the Australian darter (Plotus
nova hollanda), down Bega (N.S.W.) way this
season. Ilis long, snaky neck is his prominent fea-
ture; otherwise, except that his plumage is more
misty-brown than black, he might be mistaken for
a big shag that had run to age. Don’t know any-
thing personally of his habits, but the text-books say
that he follows the cormorant lead and goes for
scaled fish, frogs, yabbies, eels and such-like. It is
noteworthy that birds like the cormorants and darter,
which live chiefly on fish-fry, frogs, small turtles
and other aquatic creatures, mostly disappear from
coastal rivers and ponds when the cold weather sets
in, and remain away while their food is hibernating.
Such birds start breeding exceptionally early (about
July or August, I think), rear their ugly chicks, and
with them return to the fresh waters just as the
mullet are beginning to swim about the surface and
the frogs and turtles are honeymooning. Cormorants,
by the way, breed mostly on islands, but sometimes
in large and isolated swamps.
“Nosneb”: During a trip to London in
February last I saw a fish-destroying competition
between a penguin and a cormorant at the London
Zoo. The cormorant won easily by swallowing 57
fish about r*in. long in 44sec. The penguin took
about twice as long to do away with the same num-
ber. This proves what a curse the shag is to the
fishing industry. The competition can be seen any
day you’re passing the tank of glass at the Zoo.
* * * *
“Pick”: When, after months of drought,
the deluge struck Monaro (N.S.W.) last February,
the many picturesque lakes of the highlands were
filled to their brims. Immediately, colonies of
small divers of the grebe species—birds that are
never known to fly and
which have been unknown
in those regions since the
lakes went dry about 30
years ago—were estab-
lished. Whence did these
strangers so expeditiously
and in such numbers re-
sume their occupation of
the old haunts ?
“Goonah-Goorali”: Boomerangs, properly
made, can be thrown to the right or left as desired
by changing the end held in the hand. Years ago,
\isiting Europe, I took a number y>f excellently-made
boomerangs, the work of a clever aboriginal named
Kurrilla, whose output w-as in great demand by other
Binghis. W ith them I gave public exhibitions of
throwing, and was engaged by the largest place of
open-gir amusement in Paris for the whole of a
summer. The finest thrower I’ve known was Cheeky
Bunda, of Proserpine (Q.), a splendidly-built black.
He was a left-hander, and could throw the boom-
erang- to right or left, using the ordinary kind made
foi right-hand throwers. He put wonderful power
into all his throwing. Have known him smash a
kangaroo’s leg (upper part) with a brigalow nullah-
nullah at a distance of about 25 yards—a feat talked
about by his tribe for years.
**■#-,
Bally Bill’ ; “J.F.K.” is a disturber of
the peace when he says (B. 24/4/’l9) that the
“Bareoo shout” originated in Isisford (Q.) 29
years ago. I w r as in Blackall 37 years ago, and
it was an aged institution then. Some of the old
hands told me it was started in Billy Whitman's
Hotel, in Tambo, before Whittown (afterwards
known as Isisford) was a township. Now let me
rap somebody else. Some time ago some Johnny-
come-lately wrote that “the ragged 13” were dis-
gruntled shearers from the ’9l strike camps. Well,
I was on the Georgina and the O’Shannassy in 1885
and 1886, and the baker’s dozen was then going-
strong. One station-manager told me that they took
about 30 unbranded foals from his run every year.
* * *
“8.C.” : Bengha Island, the home of the
renowned fire-walkers, is about 20 miles from Suva.
The legend is that the progenitor of the tribe, while
digging yams with a pointed stick—as is the custom
to this day—lost the stick in a hole in the ground.
Pwtting in his hand to recover it, he caught the tail
of some creature, which on being dragged to light
proved to be the Fijian equivalent of Lucifer. Evi-
dently the primeval yam-digger had his Satanic
Majesty at a disadvantage, and his nibs was glad to
come to terms. As a ransom, therefore, he conferred
on his captor the dominion over fire. Thus the
Bengha people have ever since possessed the power to
walk through the element unharmed. However this
may be, the natives of Bengha walk barefooted over
red-hot stones. A party of tourists lately journeyed
from Suva to Bengha, and, after making arrange-
menfs with the chief for an exhibition, proceeded to
the town of Rukua, where the firewalking was to
take place. There was a pit about 10ft. in diameter
in which there were piles of big stones heaped on
burning logs, the stones being a few inches from the
top of the pit. .Ihese stones were red-hot, some of
them at white heat. At a signal a crowd of
natives removed the wood and spread the stones out
evenly by means of long poles. Then 10 male
natives, dressed in weird and fantastic melee cos-
tumes, with faces and limbs daubed with paint, fell
into line, and, headed by the chief, jumped into the
pit. They walked slowly twice round the ring of
the red-hot stones and then leisurely got out. The
visitors inspected the feec of the firewalkers, but
could detect no injury. This act finished, a large-
quantity of leaves was spread o'er the stones, and
the natives congregated in the centre of the pit,
crouching on the leaves and singing, while clouds of
heavy, suffocating floated round them, almost
obscuring them from view. Next, raw food was
piled on the leaves, and, covered with more leaves
and earth, was cooked.
* * * *
“F.G.”: Bula-Bula, mentioned by
“MeNorth” (B. 24/4/’l9) .as the god with nothing to
do, is not in possession of such an easy job. The origin
Of the deity was this way. A warrior fell in love with
a maiden belonging to a hostile tribe and wished her
for liis bride. His fellow-tribesmen, however, re-
fused to allow her admittance to the community. The
warrior thereupon decided to go over to the'lady’s
tribe; but her relatives had a helping of cold-
shoulder for him. The unfortunate couple eloped;
but the girl’s family pursued and dragged her back
to the homestead. The disconsolate warrior was
then supposed to have died of a broken heart (more
likely it was a broken skull), and his spirit, Bula-
Bula, was doomed to wander from tribe to tribe,
without any friendly company, until he should find a
maiden who had never felt any interest in the male
sex! If “MeNorth” reckons that that’s having
nothing to do he can take my share of it.
* * * *
“Aznc”: A Wagga (N.S.W.) newspaper
of recent date reports that a Mr. Coop and party
shot a bird that “proved to be a magnificent speci-
men of the Australian golden eagle, and measured
7ft. 3in. from tip to tip.” As a matter of fact, the
golden eagle inhabits Europe only. The up-countrv
specimen was evidently one of the indigenous wedge-
tailed species found in the Riverina. These are the
laigest eagles in the world, and are not imported
either. Moreover, they are not even related to the
European golden eagle. I have read that eagles are
protected in some parts of the world, and it does
seem a pity that these fine specimens of the feath-
ered tribe should be so indiscriminately murdered
by “sports.” Dudley Le Souef, of Melbourne Zoo,
rot long ago collected information from numerous
pastoralists in various parts of Australia, and he
came to the opinion that even on stations where the
eagles were uncommonly numerous they did more
good than harm. The evidence showed that they
pier upon rabbits and rats and only occasionally
attack lambs.
bY7 ’: If “Jaymac’’ ever has occasion to
hump bluey through 3.W. Queensland he’ll find out
whether cypress-pine is a useful timber or not. In
that part of the world cypress, belar and prickly-
pear constitute 97 per cent, of the scenery. All the
fence-posts are cypress pine, all the houses are built
of it, all the ornamental woodwork and the picture-
frames, the cow-bails and the pig-sties. As wood it
is unpopular with insurance cos., for it can shoot its
red-hot knots a distance of 30ft. from the fireplace
and does so constantly. The piercing smell of it is
always in the air and the taste of it pervades all
cooking. White ants may tackle it—but not if there
are any old grindstones or roofing-iron about.
WHERE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.
THREE-POUND-PER-WEEK SCHOOLTEACHER (contemplating affluent lumper): “There’s this
consolation—if he lived in Russia they ’ d murder him.”
‘Bardoc”: After be had chased the blacks
off the face of the Speck, the white began looking
frantically for their skulls in order to let the scien-
tific nobs ponder over the lowness of deceased in the
social scale. Specimens shot up in price till the
Adelaide Museum gave £7O for one. Recently
someone stumbled over enough scraps buried in the
sand of Tasman’s Peninsula to make about five more
or less complete craniums, but £7O can’t be got for
a head now
Jim Carew”: If you want something
superior to leather for a brake-pad, cut a slab from
the ordinary grass-tree and attach it. It lasts
longer than the hide and is more effective.
* * *
‘Briar P.”: For the information of “L."
(B. 1/5/19). Soak your pipe in cold tea if you
■vynt to keep it from burning and cracking.
Even a cow can find it hard to break off
an old habit. Robert Malseed, of Myamyu (Vic.),
deposes that his Strawberry has been milked con-
tinuously for 124 years, and is still going strong.
The \.R.C. caretaker at Plemington had previously
entered for the long-distance milking record a pet
who has been the household treasure for just over
eight years.
* * * *
“Nor’-West”: Few Australians know
much about yandying, the abo.’s method of dry-
blowing. At Moolyella, in the nor’-west of West,
yandying lead is the chief industry of the tribes, who
make a good thing out of it, pretty nearly every
buck haying some sort of a sulky for his frequent
“pinkeye” outing. The yandy is a very simple tool.
It is a short piece of troughing, or curved bark, but
the niggers get wonderful results from the deft wav
they have of shuffling dirt in it. The gins are better
at the job than the men—they are at most things
that look like work—but the slowest buck can
separate tea and sugar from sand by this method.
A fat cheque awaits the man who can devise a
shaker which is as effective. I met a friend from the
Nor’-West in England 12 months ago who was full of
the idea of recovering some of the lead that’s lying
around in France and had tried to trap the knack of
yandying in some sort of a machine. He was then
living on the steps of the Inventions Board at White-
hall, and said that some of the Sleeping Beauties
within were beginning to take notice.
“Machete”: “Melos,” in quoting black
brother’s employment of pressure to cure headaches,
has overlooked the almost universal practice of slight
“bleeding” in conjunction with the pressure. I have
seen Kaffirs and Papuans employ exactly the same
method. A string is twisted tightly round the head
above the ears, and then the skin of the forehead is
lightly gashed with knife, glass or shell, until there
is a trickle of blood. That done, Binghi just waits
till the original pain takes its departure.
THE MAN WHO WON A FORD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
S 6^ nd - pHze in the R °J a l Alfred
■l a Ford motor-car—is awaiting
a claimant. —Ominous news item.
His record was as white as snow,
His conscience once was clear;
But now by. back streets he must ’go
With his bedfellow, Fear.
The winning ticket next his heart
Lies like a naked sword ;
Lach knock and footstep makes him start,
For he has won the Ford.
His anxious friends confer and say:
“Perhaps he’s caught the ’flu!”
And then on tiptoe creep away
Some chemist’s slush to brew.
But one, the usual human crow,
Proclams with mean intent :
“Those signs of care I well do know.
It is embezzlement! ”
But he who walks beneath the curse,
Hiding his guilt, sobs: “Lord!
Put back one notch Thy universe,
And save me from the Ford!”

bidden to roll over to save his

v„ , Ao 1011 ; and I can justify him.

„ h Jl j/ 1 * - of horrific dreams, somewhere
/u?i the lt fo u r th day after a friend had
told me all about the acute stages of the

W V W ® er and a IN ark came to misquote
' v • rt. Henley, and without ceasing:
Li f e is the painted woman in the room:
Heath is the bawdy ruffian on the stair.
While 1 was congratulating myself that
this bitterness was hopeful in that it
connoted the absence of that Christian resig-
nation which is merelv the instinct to die as

and one unknowingly bade it avaunt with

out ot their vases and walked round the

To take to the doors of death to buy

Te drew one mother’* milk;
One chamber held ye all;
A very tender history
Did in your youth befal.
....When first she got the rum
Her blood began to smoke.
But always back to this —
Life is the painted woman in the room ;
Death is the bawdy ruffian on the stair.
All the bludgers and gunmen and plug-uglies
came, and my accommodating-room enlarged
itself to take them.
Jack Mann, the scenic artist, says that
vermilion and emerald green painted next
one another vibrate. My room is in French
grey with a band of Venetian red and a dado
of Brunswick green below. It didn’t vibrate,
it pulsed, advanced and retired ; the. Vene-
tian red band set to partners, and the Bruns-
wick green advanced, and the Venetian red
went back again. And then it stopped and
the tide came into my room, tinkled and
bobbed against the walls, rippling quietly
past the bed; and then ebbed and went out
again.
And there were real visitors; men mostly
keeping away ’flu with alcohol.
There came a friend one afternoon, and
he was full; wept over me and gave me a
pearl pin, to bribe Death with, maybe. I
told him to take it away.
“No fear,” said he, “it’s yours. Where’ll
I put it?”
“Put it in that coat near the door so that
you can get it easily when your generosity
repents.”
He disclaimed any repentance or its pos-
sibility ; but that night, when the Venetian
red and the Brunswick green were setting
to partners again, in the dark, he came to
the door and said with a voice full of healthy
drunkenness: “Where’s my pin?”
With the egotism of the'drunk he switched
on the light, and stabbed my eyes. And I
opened my mouth in rage and closed it again.
My room had expanded and he was standing
on the horizon two miles away retrieving the
pearl pin.
There came a better man than he a little
later; most lovable, and not quite so drunk.
“Dear old Randolph,” said he, “don’t die.
Y'got to be Prime Minister yet, and get me
a job as poundkeeper. If you can’t do that.
Inspector of Weights and Measures will do
me Have a drink, y’old dog. You de-
serve this. Here you are. walking up and
down in the world, and God sees you at last
and says ‘Who’s this with the grin?’ And
he lands you good and hard. Have a drink,
Randolph ! I don’t mean a word of it. Get
well and make me poundkeeper.”
And here was I making a bad passage in
the best of conditions. What of the poor
in Surry Hills and Pyrmont, where bad land-
lordism provides flesh for the pestilence and
overcrowd in sr eats the people as hunger
gnaws bread?
The. walls advanced and receded not so
days, but all tins verses
an« th» pjose I bar# ewer known and re-
membered repeated themselves all over again,
a+i. * n \ ey got , hi ms elf misquoted always,
bo that when at large I dug up the real stuff,
and here it is:
Madame Life’s a piece in bloom
Death g-oes dogging everywhere:
She s the tenant' of the room
Hes the ruffian on the stair
You shall see her as a friend,

Hut he ll trap you in the end,
And hell stick you for her price.
With his knee-bones at your chest,
And his knuckles on your throat,
\ou would reason, plead, protest,
Clutching at her petticoat.
But she’s heard it all before •
Well she knows you’ve had ’your *uu;
Gingerly she gains the door
And your little job is done.

“Murkali” : I can’t agree with “Condenser”
(B. 10/4/T9) that the necessity for using
“undamped” or continuous waves will make
wireless telephony dearer than the same
brand of telegraphy. The production of such
waves by the arc method is a much cheaper
process than the generation of the “damped”
waves of the practically obsolete spark sys-
tems. The arc is being installed in all later-
day naval and commercial radio stations, in-
cluding the scores (ship and shore) which
are being erected by the British Navy. The
arc machinery is almost ludicrously simple
by comparison with the costly gear of
the “damped” systems, and the same
results are achieved with a fraction of
the power. The spark stations at Pen-
nant Hills (Sydney) and Awanui (M.L.)
were designed for continuous day and
night communication. Though each of
40-k.w. power and separated by a trifle
like 1200 miles, they make a very poor show-
ing at daylight work. The Sonoma and Ven-
tura, with their 5-k.w. arc sets, regularly
lob messages _ into Sydney from 2000 miles
away in daylight. Sometimes Sydney, with
its 40-k.w., can’t return O.lv. till dark. Sit-
ting in Sydney Radio (Pennant Hills) I have
listened to a cornet Solo played on the Sonoma
80 miles away. The “signals” were strong
and would have stood relaying on to any
telephone in Sydney.

“F.C.”: Early this summer, when plums
were fairly plentiful in Melbourne, and
little other fruit was available, the
thrifty housewife set about making a supply
of jam. She found that only enough
sugar was to be had to sweeten the old
man’s tea. A few weeks later sugar was on
sale in any quantity. Now, when the same
housewife has bought a few cases of quinces
and a citron-melon or two, and has scoured
her preserving pan, she suddenly finds that
her grocer has run out of sugar and can’t
get any for love or money. The fact that
scarcity always occurs when private jam-
making ought to be in full swing begins to
look suspicious.

“Gleniris”: The record rent of £lO an acre
is now being paid for onion-land in the Colae
district (Vic.). Old growers, speaking out
of the fulness of their whiskers, have long
declared that any man who grows onions
on the right sort of land for three successive
years will come out right. The course of
sales during pre-war years mostly showed
that, when onions were dear, everybody grew
them for the next season. Then there would
be a glut, the price would go down to 30s.
a ton, and onions would be a neglected crop
again Of recent years, however, the rate
has been well above the paying-line each
season, with the result that first-class land
ot the correct constituents is now hungrily
sought after. Still, slumps will recur; and

HOW COOLAHAN ENRICHED HIS SOIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long Coolahan had farmed his land
At W elshinan’s thirteen years.
So far, his spuds, I understand,
Had nowhere found their peers;
And super-phosphates, rich and new,
Upon his land the good man strew
To outgrow everything that grew.
The crop was wondrous to behold;
But, digging rather deep,
The farmer touched on virgin gold.
As they that sow shall reap,
Long Coolahan turned up that day
With spuds as big as tubs, they say—
Rich specimens to fill a dray.
He’d struck the reef-cap, and it shed
A yellow lustre all around,
And Coolahan, half off his head,
Stared at the golden ground.
“I’d be a millionaire, for sure,”
Said he in awe, “did I procure
Just wan more bag iv that manure!”

A dear old lady, the wife of a very dis-
tinguished soldier who returned the other
day. was worried by the language of thought-
less Diggers who foregathered over cards on
the deck outside her cabin every afternoon.
One day. when the adjectival business was
at its height, she said to her husband in her
sweet, clear treble: “Close the port-
hole. please, my dear, and we may possibly
hear less of this swearing.” A dead
hush followed. The card-players withdrew
as furtively as their issue boots would per-
mit and returned no more.
“Fuzz”: Cobwebster cuts the commission
of the stamp agents from 24 to 1 per cent,
and brings turmoil into my life. Where I

from him. The other chemist has the
postage license, and occasionally I am forced
to go, after 6 o’clock, to ask for a stamp,
lie comes from behind his partition, smiling
a welcome till he sees me, when the grin
fades into a horrible scowl. He knows
that I buy my pills elsewhere. Now Cob-
webster has docked him 14 per cent, and 1
fear the worst. If he scowls for 24 per
cent, what will he do for 1 per cent. ? I
will have to either give him my pill and
ointment trade and lose the friend of a life-
time, or kill him some evening after tea and
have his license transferred to the other
shop.
“Dead-ed”: Does anybody remember
Jolfre the Strong Man. whose “jahb” it was
to carry about on his head a cannon, while
a lovely lady banged it off amidst great
applause anil the stink of gunpowder?
Lots of people believed the gun to be a
terrible weight, and it became Joffre’s busi-
ness to foster the idea. However, he struck
a snag in a Gippsland township, when he
offered a quid to any man who was able to
carry the weapon from the town hall to
the railway station. Wheat-stackers rolled
up in dozens, and one of their number, with
the gun on his back, did a turkey-trot in
the principal street and then took it away
four miles into the bush, leaving .Toffre to
cart it back again. This got the showman
pretty sick; so he filled ’em up with drinks
and thereby reduced the reward from one
pound to two shillings.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” remembers: —
The Bulletin's mention of Amess, Mayor of Mel-
bourne, awakes memories. He it was who welcomed
the visitors at the opening of the present Town Hall,
and the aldermen and councillors in return enter-
tained him. There was a notable reunion then. The
guests included the Mayor of Adelaide (J. M. Solo-
mon) and the representatives of other colonies on a
visit to the city, including Aid. Anthony Hordern of
Sydney. J. T. Smith (seven times Mayor of Mel-
bourne and a Sydney native) occupied the chair, and
Aid. Edward Cohen was vice-chairman. , Responding
to the toast, “The Corporation of Sydney,” Aid.
Hordern said it was the third occasion on which he
had been present when the Council had commenced
business in new premises. He was present at their
first meeting in 1842, when they began their work
in a very humble building, the site of which was
now occupied by the Criterion Hotel (to-day by the
Union Hank). He was also present on a subsequent
occasion when they held their first sitting in the
Mechanics’ Institute, in Coll ins-street. He added
that when councillors for Melbourne were first nomi-
nated, he had proposed Aid. Smith, their chairman,
and observed, as a queer coincidence, that Smith,
Cohen, Solomon (Mayor of Adelaide) and himself had
all been schoolmates in Sydney.
“N.F.S.”: In Queen Elizabeth's time the
first playhouses were built in London.
Before then, and long afterwards in other
cities, the yard of the inn was the scene of
the playactors’ art. Note the terms “stalls,”
“boxes,” “pit” and “gallery,” the last being
the balcony round the yard, as can be seen
in “Phiz’s” illustrations. The first London
playhouses were modelled on these inn-yards.
And our Australian theatres are built on
the same absurd principle. One quarter of
the seats are situated so that their occu-
pants see but three-quarters, at most, of the
stage. To half the audience the voices of
the actors come rumbling, battling against
echoes from the high ceiling. The gaudy
tawdriness of the decoration offends the eyes
of anyone with a color sense. To this add
bad ventilation, draughty passages and flea-
infested seats. I remember a Continental
theatre I visited in the happy pre-war days.
The entrances, offices, pay-boxes, etc., were
on the sides of the building, and behind these
were the wings. This arrangement per-
mitted the stage to occupy the full width of
the building, and so abolished all angles of
vision. The floor (there were no balconies)
sloped so that everyone, even in the back
seats, had a perfect view of the stage. The
ceiling was not high, and every Avord could
be distinctly heard, despite the fact that
French actors speak faster than English.
And all the seats were of the same quality,
variation of price depending only on dis-
tance from the stage.

“Unalloyed” Dyes
The dyes used in Hose
of Luxite are “unalloyed”—not
loaded with heavy metallic com'
pounds to give the hose a glossy,
heavy appearance.
The soft, full-bodied shimmer of
Hose of Luxite is gained by the
use of rich, fine-stitched materials,
pure-dyed.
That is why its elegance and
beauty last through repeated wash-
ings.
The wide range of styles and
prices will suit every purse and
purpose.
Don’t accept substitutes, and
think you have “Luxite.”
Insist upon the genuine.
If your dealer is unable to

The latest delicate English way of putting
Blight. —On the 26th instant, at 31 Oxley ®-oad,
Watford, Mrs. Horace V. Blight rejoiced in the birth
of a son (John Horace). »
A large estate, the aggregation of a Mel-
bourne beokinaker lately deceased, is being
advertised for sale by auction. Much of
the land in this valuable assortment is suit-
able for far more intensive cultivation than
was ever likely to be given it by any one
owner; yet the departed grabber was able
to collar and hold 2000 acres within 15
miles of Melbourne!
“Simon Luke”: Talking of prohibition.
The late George Musgrove, dumped down in
a little Maoriland village infected with pro-
hibition, called for whisky. “We’ll have to
send 20 miles for it,” said the landlord
doubtfully. Then George would add: “But
they were blessed with marvellously quick
locomotion in that little one-horse town. We
got our drinks in three minutes!”
The first hint about getting busy with the
Newcastle steel works was given in August,
1802, when Lord Hobart observed in a des-
patch to Governor King: “Iron ore is found
in abundance in N. S. Wales, and as coals
are equally so it is presumed the Governor
may without difficulty erect furnaces for
smelting it. The cinders or coke of coals
from which the tar has been extracted by the
usual process of covering the heap with clay
and inserting a funnel for carrying off the
tar will give the strongest heat.”
“Hermish” : Since Russia boiled over vari-
ous curious situations have arisen with regard
to Russian sailing-vessels absent from home
waters. In some cases the masters have
received no tidings at all from their owners
since the first revolution. There are at pre-
sent in Australia three _ ships of Russian
registration in the service of the British
authorities. What has happened to their
owners in the chaos is still worrying the
masters, who are in the position of being
bosses and (for the time, at any rate)
owners of boats that don’t belong to them.
The importer—the agent for the absentee
manufacturer and cheap laborer—isn’t a
backward person. When some of him de-
manded that the war embargo on foreign
confectionery should be lifted, he advanced
as a reason that, while the embargo was on,
the Australian manufacturers had had a
good time. That isn’t so very certain, but
whatever good time they had was shared with
their employees—the white Australians who
collected a white Australian wage. To the
importers the idea of anybody save an im-
porter having a good time is little less than
criminal.
“Hermish”: The existence of a two-up
school just outside the offices of the
Repatriation Department at Jolimont (Vic.)
conducted by men who are not returned
soldiers is a scandal. Returned men are
not schoolboys, but the sight of another man
(generally a buttoner) winning cash hand
over fist is a big temptation to the Digger
who has just received his sustenance allow-
ance or other money. Of course, the mug
who ventures loses in the end. A fair game
of two-up is all right. I’ve played it myself
and have nothing against it. . But I wouldn’t
venture into that permanent school of
sharks.
“Cardiff” : I left a Coal Commission sitting
in England and lobbed on top of one when I
arrived in Sydney. The agonised cries of
the squeezed consumer reached my ears when
the ship was seven miles off the coast —an
echo of what I had left behind. Giving
evidence before the English Commission, J.
C. Stamp, representative of the Board of
Inland Revenue, spread the glad tidings
that in 191(5 £10,000,000 was received in
excess profits tax from the coal-owners of
Britain! I was glad to learn from
newspaper reports of the proceedings of the
trouble in Australia that nobody here makes
any profit out of the industry.
One Jean Pierre Puruy, a Swiss from
Neuchatel, was a century and a bit ahead
of E. G. Wakefield with a proposal for a
colony in S. Aus. or thereabouts. In 1717
Puruy, then holding a job at Batavia, put
before the Governor of the Netherlands
Indies a plan for a colony in Nuyts Land, so
called after Pieter Nuyts, who had in 1627
coasted along the Bight. Puruy got the
frosty eye from the official, but he published
a pamphlet about his project at Amsterdam
in 3718, and afterwards hawked the notion
to France and England, but failed to get a
good listening. Finally he went colonising
himself in Georgia (now U.S.A.), and died
there.
From an Australian coal man in China: —
Dazzling reports are frequently heard of China’s
enormous coal deposits, yet China’s imports still
exceed its exports. A recent official estimate of
the country’s wealth in coal indicates that there
is sufficient to supply the world at the present rate
of consumption for 1000 years. The fuel is found
in practically every province. The present pro-
duction is about 20,000,000 tons a year, and of this
quantity about half is taken from mines worked
under modern methods. One mine in Chihli has a
daily output of 14,500 tons, and another in Man-
churia 8000 tons. But modern transportation facilities
and better mining laws are necessary before China
can have a chance to show its real capacity as a
coal producer.
Victoria’s first cattle-station was at Gar-
diner’s Creek, in country now being covered
by suburbs of Melbourne. The cattle were
brought overland from the Murrumbidgee
by John Gardiner, Joseph Hawdon and John
Hepburn, who reached Melbourne in Decem-
ber, 1836. According to Hepburn there
were only 15 head of cattle at Port Phillip
when they arrived, though about 4000 sheep
had been ferried over from Van Diemen’s
Land. Gardiner bought out his partners
and for a while ran a meat-supply business,
having his killing paddock on the present
site of the Botanic Gardens. Hepburn
(who had been a sea-captain) and Hawdon
hired a 10-ton boat, the Hope, and took the
stockmen back to N. S. Wales. Hepburn
took the Hope into the Moruya (N.SIW.),
and claims that this was the first vessel to
enter that river. A few months later
Hawdon started to run the first overland
mail from Sydney to Melbourne. Hepburn
came overland again, with sheep this time,
in January, 1838, and squatted on a run
near what is now Castlemaine.


ROADABILITY
As exemplified in the New 1919
Studebakers, indicates that com-
bination of design, balance and
mechanical perfection that
enables a quality automobile to drive and ride
easily, to hold the crown or side of a bad track
without “whip” or “side-sway,” and to transmit
the power throu'ghout'wlthout appreciable loss
or “back-lash.”
Thus the term ROADABILITY is synonymous with that of
QUALITY, the Studebaker ideal, and productive of true
ECONOMY in operation and upkeep.
In these beautiful new models, all the modern developments of
mechanical excellence are so co-related in BALANCE and
CONSTRUCTIONAL STRENGTH that SERVICE,
SAFETY and ECONOMY are not confined to special features,’
but are granted throughout by their ENTIRELY EFFICIENT
DESIGN.

“I was disfigured by blackheads and

Puts New Life
Into Your Motor Car
THERE is nothing so annoying as en-
gine trouble, and 80 °Jo of it is caused
by Carbon. That knocking and loss of
power, extravagant use of fuel and slow
response to the throttle are due to just cne
thing—carbon in your cylinders. Clean
them out with
and your car will run as it did the first month—
quietly and full of life.
Five minutes’ time is all it requires. Simply
pour an ounce of Carbon Remover into each
cylinder through the spark plug opening. Allow
it to stand 30 to 45 minutes. Then start your
engine and watch the cloud of carbon come out
through the exhaust. You can minimize carbon
accumulation by adding
4 ounces of Carbon Re-
mover to each 10 gallons
of petrol you use.
Safe and Guaranteed
Johnson’s Carbon Remover is
excellent for any type of engine.
It cannot injure the metal in any
way, does not affect the lubrica-
tion or injure the oil in the crank
case. Thousands of letters in
our files bear testimony of the
wonderful results obtained from
Johnson’s Carbon Remover.
Buy a trial tin from your dealer.

When the coins of British design are added
to the 45,000,000 that have been struck off
in Australia, there are 18 bronze tokens per
head of population of the Commonwealth,
and that is quite enough for any man to
have in his pocket at a time.
“Fair Dinkum”: We had a number of
Tommy drill-instructors attached to our
battalion. Their first thought on being
attached was to get out of their own uniform
and into an Aussie rigout. We knew them
then as Woodbines in a Capstan packet.
“Joyce”: J. E. Birt, who lost the Labor
nomination for Paddington (Sydney) by a
few votes, is a good sport. He had a pro-
test to lodge against O’Hara’s selection ; but
when he heard that it was O’Hara’s birth-
day, he rang up and made him a present of
the protest.
“Bill Blank”: “C.S.G.’s” (B. 1/5/T9)
instance of hard luck. How’s this? A Dig-
ger in our battalion was granted 10 days’
Paris leave at the beginning of July, ’l7, but
was recalled on reaching Amiens. He set
out again at the end of Jujy, and whilfi
walking off the station at Paris was killed
1 by one of the last shells from the long-range
gun.
Some slanders are not to be taken lying
down by even the mild-mannered inhabitants
of the Speck. Wherefore this angry advt.
in Hobart Mercury :
A report having been spread that one of we boj-s
has joined the Police Force, we deny this and
challenge anyone to come forward and make a state-
ment to that effect.— Claude llay, Roy Hay, Law-
rence Hay.
“Hamer”: Some of these home-service
birds are real martyrs, and they don’t fail to
let us know it. Almost the first official we
met at Fremantle was checking the names of
returning soldiers. It was a biggish job, and
“I’ve not been able to get home for four
days,” be complained bitterly. There were
deep sighs of ironical pity from the men
who had been away from home for four
years or more.
Apparently spades were favored as cooking
implements, in default of the proper article,
in old N. S. Wales. In an official despatch
to the Colonial Office, dated November 18,
1791, Governor Phillip says, after observing
that the colony was “much distressed” for
want of crosscut saws, axes, iron pots and
combs: “Two or three hundred iron frying-
pans will be a saving of spades.”
A Perth soldier’s wife was greatly per-
turbed recently when she received a letter
from her husband. Although in his hand-
writing, it was written in French. A friend
obliged with a translation; it turned out to
be an application to a French co. for pro-
visional employment (permitted by the
A.1.F.) to gain further experience in metal-
lurgy. Doubtless there was some head-
scratching in an establishment in France
when the love-missive came to hand.
“Shorty”: I am a returned officer regis-
tered at the Department of Repatriation,
Sydney, looking for work. Thursday is the
day that men with my initial call. I was
there at 9 a.m., and it took from then till
-.00 p.m. for the office to tell me that there
was no job available. But the greatest joke
of all was that when I said that I didn’t
want sustenance and refused to go and draw
it, rny name was crossed off the books, as
they thought I did not want a job !
A Vic. police magistrate received a shock
last month. He was appointed to a centre
m which he had often stayed during his pre-
magisterial days, and among the first mat-
ters brought to his notice was the reputation
of one of the district hostelries—a pioneer
inn, long ago delicensed and now a superior
boarding-house retaining the old name.
“Illicit trading?” he said unbelievingly.
‘Why, I’ve stayed at that house off and on
for 10 years, and never dreamt it wasn’t
fully licensed.”
“U.P.”: A piece of swamp-land on the
Port Adelaide River is rapidly being trans-
formed into a shipbuilding yard. Poole
and Steel, who obtained a contract
for four standardised vessels of 5500
tons from the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, have dredged 80(fft. frontage to
a depth of 15ft. at low water; machinery is
in course of erection, and the first keel
should be laid within three months. That
will be the start of steel shipbuilding in the
State, . and if Bolshevism doesn’t intervene
with strikes the industry will be vigorously
pushed on. Managing-director Poole does
not anticipate any difficulty: the workmen,
he says, are taking a great interest in the
job and realise its importance to the State.
“Umntu”: The request of certain French
inhabitants of Mauritius that Britain should
now return that island to France has an
Australian interest. It was on this island,
then called lie de France, that Flinders,
with all the charts and documents of his
coastal explorations of Australia, was un-
warrantably incarcerated for six and a half
years. But even so the French did not
play the Hun. None of his charts or
scientific documents were stolen; the charge
that some historians have made that the
French plagiarised them for the account of
Baudin’s expeditions in “Le Geographe” and
“Le Naturaliste,” is, as Scott shows, :ot
well grounded : and the people of the island
were very friendly to him, the Soci6te
D’Emulation giving a dinner in his honor
just before he left.
The Healesville train, which takes 148
minutes to travel 39 miles, is often quoted
as the shocking example of Vic. railway
management; but it is a swift conveyance
compared with, say, the Gembrook train. The
journey to Melbourne, about 30 miles, takes
more than four hours. The train to Dayles-
ford (82 miles), which starts at 6.40 a.m.
and gets there after midday, is another in-
stance of repellent railway service to a
health resort. But these are only slight
exaggerations of the time-wastage inflicted
on travellers everywhere. Australia is a
slow-going country—and doesn’t know it.
Melbourne is especially slow—slow in its
train service and cable trams; slow to part
with its old, rattle-trap cabs and demand the
convenience of taxi-cab ranks; slow to de-
velop its Bay excursion and Yarra excursion
possibilities: slow to anger against the Gov-
ernment which keeps it the deadliest of dull
cities on Sundays.

A tiny fairy travelling on her toes,
Timid as Joy, comes in to earn her wage,
While like a gale the panto, music blows
Through groves of legs that dress the radiant stage.
Lights up! and let us make the best of Life,
While life remains, nor think of gloomy things.
While the house roars to hear the panto, wife,
The Demon bites his fingers in the wings.
The re-opening of Her Majesty’s with
"Goody Two Shoes” should help Sydney to
recover its lost tone. There is little sparkle
about the book; but the show is so crowded
that that fragment of English literature is
only sighted occasionally as a tattered
volume flying through the air. Dame Arthur
Stigant appears once more as a plausible old
potterer. He has an extensive repertoire of
old-lady mannerisms, and, except where
special costume insanities are forced upon
him, his dressing isn’t beyond the bounds of
possibility. It is only by looking closely that
a metal dog-collar is seen to be keeping com-
pany With a black bombazine street dress and
bonnet. There is plenty of humor in his
dancing, and when he falls backward into a
hip-bath and whoops hysterically it suggests
real life at its worst. May de Sousa's princi-
pal asset as “boy” is her slight and elegant
figure. Her small voice is taxed to the
utmost in the "high flights that are part of the
job. Madeleine Harrison is an average prac-
titioner in the principal-girl line, and never
hits the house hard until she has a line of
dashing Australian dancing girls, dressed as
France, leg-waving behind her. Little Toby
Claude, with plentv of personality, works
considerable sparkle into three songs.
# * * *
Solo-dancer Maggie Dickinson’s best, show
is with Sydney Yates in the Kirchner Ballet
—one of the ton-notes. The arrangement
and dressing of this is like a straight left to
the carping critic. The surrounding girls—
each posed in imitation of one of the famous
pictures—hardly blink an eyelash during the
progress of the whirlwind dance of the princi-
pals. Fred Walton (“The Toy Soldier”) gives
a genuine panto, touch with his silent clown-
ing. With an elaborate flesh-tinted make-up
he is full-brother to the four bald dummies
“JACK AND JILL," at Sydney Palace.
“ Ginger ” Bailey trifling with Dame
Lupin o's girlish affections.
he is wheeled in with. The Kenna Brothers,
comedy acrobats, show something new in
thrills, and Jewel’s Marionette Circus is an
elaborate outfit that fills the big stage. There
Is a fine exhibition of Punch-and-Judy vio-
lence when the doll spectator who resembles
the late W. E. Gladstone applauds the doll
dancer too hard and is battered over the head
by his wife. Floie Allan, Phyllis Porter and
their sister-artistes of the chorus and ballet
are all good ads for the home-grown panto
girls who helps the imported principal
through. Coleman's brush supplies the
scenery.
* * * *
The show’s chief fault is superabundance.
When an entertainment is still going at
11.15 it is time for the management to cut
and audience to run.
* * * *
Land-agents and others in search of new
prevarications should avoid the Criterion
(Sydney). M. B. Figman is still offering
“Nothing but the Truth'’ at that address.
* * *
The “Jack and Jill’’ pantomime at the
Palace, Sydney, under the combined J. and
N. Tait and Bailey and Grant management,
is a good tonic for influenza. All the usual
panto, features are there, and anybody who
has a favorite gag will find the old friend in
the bill; but he will at least find it well
dressed. Barry Lupino, as the Dame, and Bert;
Bailey, as Ginger, work hard to keep the
laughter going and succeed to a notable ex-
tent. Joe Brennan is mirthful in spots,
and William A. Ilassan is a cheerful and
sometimes pathetic donkey. One of the
brightest bits of the show is the “Nursery
Book’’ song and ballet, performed by Austra-
lian children; and perhaps the best color
and movement are seen in the street in
Bagdad, which closes the first act. Ida
Newton and Gracie Dorran. as Jack and
Jill, look comparatively like the children in
the okl rhyme; Violet Collinson makes a
charming nrincess and Dorothy Leieh a per-
fectly satisfactory principal boy; Lena
Henry dances gaily in the chief limelight;
and George Moon and Daniel Morris, freak
dancers of an unusual kind, are tremen-
dously popular. Until' somebody again hits
the barmy idea of putting the children’s
taste first, as Bill Anderson did with such
success in his last oautomime. a show like
that now at the Palace can hold its own
with any of the more elaborate productions
of the same order.
* * * *
That good Australian show, Wirths’ Cir-
cus, opened its belated Easter season at the
Hippodrome (Sydney) on Saturday. Owing
to the see-saw that the Cabinet and its ’flu
advisers have been playing for weeks past
there was little time, when restrictions were
suddenly withdrawn, for the town-crier to
pass round the glad tidings that the big
show was at the old stand in the Hay-
market. Nevertheless the house was packed.
Hitherto, for 25 or 30 years, horses and
ponies have been the big feature of the
Wirths’ programme; but this year acrobats
are the strong suit. A fine lot, too. The
Flying Winskills (with a Charlie Chaplin
clown) are probably the best trapezists since
the great Flying Jordans. Another turn
that nobody should miss, unless everybody
is hankering after regret, is Dick Cavill’s
Australian water team. The diving, especi-
ally the daring leap by Charlie Scott,
couldn’t be seen elsewhere in any show in
the world. The Garcias, Beattie De Alma,
the military geese, the horsemen and the
horsegirls are all welcome. The clowning
lacks sparkle. Still the cackle of children’s
laughter suggests that perhaps sparkle isn’t
the thing that clowns are after.
At Sydney Tivoli on Saturday afternoon
H. D. Mclntosh will start Old Bill, Bert and
Alf at work in “The Better ’Ole.”
Sydney Lyceum has seven acts of Nazi-
mova. There is a maze of little paths run-
ning off the highway, and Nazimova curls
and twists among them all. Mary Pickford
unpacks her make-up at Hoyt’s and the Hay-
market as “Amarilly of Clothesline Alley.”
She’s a nice, clean little thing whose mother
takes in washing. Of course, the usual
young plutocrat falls in with the girl; but
love masquerading as Terry McGowan, a
barman, proves irresistible, and Amarilly
settles down in happiness in that station in
life to which it has pleased, etc. Infatua-
tion is unmasked at the Crystal Palace and
the Strand, with Gaby Deslys in her towering
headgear.

The long-deferred fourth Orchestral pop
filled Sydney Town Hall on Saturday.
Except for a deafening clash of the brasses,
noticeable in “F§te Boh&me” and in the
final of the Grieg suite, it was an evening
of melody. The “Mignon” overture and
the Massenet “Air de Ballet” were played
with the butterfly brilliancy that is one of
the orchestra’s chief charms. Grieg’s “Peer
Gynt” suite poured out its enchantment and
won the usual encore. Sullivan called up
a vision of a world in which there was time
for stately movement in “A Graceful Dance
from Henry VIII.” Lilian Gibson Mtes a
reflective rather than an actively passionate
Delilah in the perennial “Softly Awake,”
and by this very tone caught the spirit of
the Goring Thomas “Summer Night.” Wag-
ner’s “Rienzi” was the tumultuous finale.
Harry Dearth, the newly-imported Tait
songster at Melbourne Auditorium, ought to
satisfy every popular requirement, lie has
any amount of voice, an original range of
songs, and is also unhampered by the dig-
nity that takes refuge in the orthodox plat-
form manner. He warbles his repertoire
with his hands in his pockets or leaning cas-
ually on the piano, and he has sufficient
sense of the force of variety to switch from
a pathetic air to a humorous absurdity and
arrange his countenance to suit the change.
On Saturday he gave Sanderson's “Company
Sergeant-Major” along with Douglas
Grant’s “Little French Baby” and two or
three more, and he never had to perspire to
get the audience’s approval. Harold Elvins.
who corroborated Dearth’s heartiest per-
formances at the piano, did Zanella s taking
little “Menuetto” on his own account, and
kept abreast of Leila Doubleday’s violin in
a lively section of Grieg’s Sonata in C
Minor. As a soloist, Leila followed her well-
blazed trail through the “Praeludium and
Allegro” of Pugnani-Kreisler, and also fully
appreciated the fact that Sarasate’s “Zap-
teado” wa3 not exactly a rest-home for a
tired virtuoso. Miss Elsy Treweek’s soprano
was hired for a Tschaikowsky item and a
couple of French songs, and Miss Ivy
Philips sang Elgar’s “Like to the Damask
Rose” and Herbert Hughes’s “Lover’s
Curse” with a voice embroidered in velvet
and gold brocade. Next Saturday night
Dearth will be heard again.
* * * *
At Melbourne King’s the laugh of the
tuneful laddie is infectious as ever, and his
character sketch of the sailor who expects
to be away from two to 20 years on his
next voyage is one of his very best. Lauder
has cut out the old drinking songs for the
present, being doubt-
less of opinion that
whusky and beer didn’t
help to win the war
His regard for lasses
has lost none of its
early keenness, how-
ever,, whilst the mag
netism of the man has
improved in quality
and gained in breadth.
There is but one Harry
La,uder, and his per-
sonality is his profit,
or most of it. Muriel
Window possesses per-
sonality, too, as well
as a large assortment
of clothes and other
attractions. She be-
longs to the order of
vaudeville ladies known
as “tricks,” or “bits
of orlright.” Spice and
ginger fight for pre-
eminence in her shapely
composition, and after
an occasional drop
into sentimentality she
whistles herself back
to normal. The humor
of Montrose’s dumb
clowning doesn’t
weaken on acquaint-
ance, nor is the turn
of the comedy jugglers
more than three
minutes too long.
Melbourne Audi-
torium.
Harry Dearth, the

No more fatuous insult to the intelligence
of Irishmen has probably ever been perpe-
trated than dad Marcus O’Dea who, after
acquitting Happy Larry at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s of the false charge of burgling his
safe, accepts the villain’s explanation re-
some missing documents in which
the pror boy is wrongly implicated. But
“Happy Larry” is full of strange absurdities
of conduct. In fact, ludicrous situations
become so common that any sudden return
to sanity would seem eccentric. All round,
the piece is too poor in the essentials of
Irish drama to meet the demands of a
pathriotic voung actor like Denis Ivehoe.
Denis warbles and plays the Irish harp, but
he needs the influence of Irish costume or
the smiling Irish scenery to get the color
of the counthry into his blarney. Without
those inspirations Kehoe is too cool and
sedative in character. He has the undis-
tinguished style of his opponent J. L. Law-
rence, who commits the most dreadful crimes
in a disinterested bread-and-butter manner.
Doubtless Kehoe will wake to the richer
opportunities offered next Saturday in “The
Days of ’98.”
#* * *
“My Lady Frayle” is still providing the
Devil with some small recreation at Mel-
bourne Tivoli.
* * * *
“Going Up” continues to be the bill at
Melbourne Majesty’s. There is nobody new
in the show ; but Field Fisher seems to be
getting larger.
** * *
Among the surprises afforded by “Com-
mon Clay” at Melbourne Royal none is
more suggestive of unpoetic justice than the
embarrassment prepared for young Arthur
Coakley. When Ellen Neal appeals on
behalf of her illicit infant, Arthur is ready
to damage her chances with personal evi-
dence of her eariy character. But the
Law has a brick ready for the uu-
chivalrous witness. It comes in the
shape of a cold intimation that he eau-
not open his mouth about Ellen without
charging himself with leading the legal in-
fant astray.

of Dorothy Gish, who demonstrates readi-
ness and decision in handling the affairs
of one “Battling Jane.” Wallace Ileid,
Hoyt’s specialist in regeneration, shows in
“The Source” the effect of a wild lumber-
man’s life on a
disconsolate city
loafer. The pres-
ence of many big-
muscled men raises
biff to the dignity
of a religion in the
story. Near by
Virginia Pearson
has her customary
heartache in “The
Liar.” At the
Paramount the
practised Metro
partners, Francis
Bushman and
Beverly Bayne,
gradually reduce
the distance be-
tween them in the
sentimental effu-
sion, “A Pair of
Cupids.” At the

Of a Melbourne picture show: —
The Vic. Artists’ display this year is mostly a pot-
boilers’ conspiracy. Few of the prominent artists
appear, and the consequence is a tremendous intru-
sion of amateurs, who tend to lower the standard of
achievement. The exhibition is weakest in portrait-
ure, Miss Irvine, Miss Teague and Miss Marion
Jones alone doing any sort of justice to the human
countenance. Miss Teague is the least enlivening of
the three, but her solid British study of Captain
Luks at least offers the charm of contrast to Miss
Irvine’s French impressionism. Miss Jones, who
sparkles in pastel, never loiters in her effort towards
an artistic objective. There is an elan about many
of her performances that would give a churchwarden
the vivacity of a Pierrot. Of the smaller portraitists
the best is Miss Dora Wilson ; yet she scores outers
after the most careful aim at her targets. A back-
view of a nude by Miss Roxburgh is not very allur-
ing, and Miss Sutherland’s surveys of two or three
bare damsels yield nothing very gratifying in paint-
ing or posture. The landscape department is re-
markable for the industry of W. Delafield Cook. In
the north gallery he has eight catalogues of Aus-
tralian scenery. His most difficult enterprise is
“Moonrise on Lake Tyers,” wherein he has caught the
lake, arrested the moonrise, and fastened a couple of
abos. to the foreground. W. B. Mclnnes and Norman
Macgeorge jog one's memory of their existence with
immaterial sketches, and Montague Brown, who used
to sail into notice under a huge spread of canvas,
tries to imprison a sheep-run in a square foot of
frame. A new hand, Victor Zelman, who hangs a
macaroni factory and a dairy and wouldn’t shrink
from a brewery or a bone-mill, is indebted to his
imagination for his fine sense of color, and there is
a young lady, Joan Weigall, whose fancy plays a part
in all her compositions. F. G. Reynolds’s palette takes
the stridency out of the brilliant Australian daylight,
and is hardly delicate and warm enough for his
“Evening, Mentone,” or the rather flat portrait of
Mrs. Malcolm Russell. W. Nieholls Anderson also
presents an “Evening, Mentone,” which contains more
evening and less Mentone than Reynolds’s. IV.
Knox makes curious use of the sun as a spotlight on
sleeping scenery, but he has plenty of ripening talent,
nevertheless. Also, Gena Murphy’s color is happy in
spots, and the designs of Christian Yandell and Ethel
Jackson Morris are worth a Second look in the cen-
tral gallery.

Adelaide Royal, which has been running
“Hearts of the World” for a fortnight, is
changing over to the sooken drama, with
Emelie Polini in “De Luxe Annie.” Sev-
eral Shaw and Galsworthy plays also are
promised for afternoon performance while
Gregan McMahon is in Adelaide. At the
Tivoli, Old Bill and his crew had a good
season. This house now switches back to
Australian drama with the old “Squatter's
Daughter.” Cappelli's fine voice is the main
item at the Majestic; but A1 Bruce’s merry
crowd account for half the programme, and
Joe and Vera White have a good turn of
their own. The pictures are a matter of
names for the moment.

For any weakness of throat or chest, or any tendency
to tuberculosis; for a troublesome cough, bronchitis or
any chest affection, the standard, approved treatment is a
course of Angier’s Emulsion. This remedy combines sooth-
ing and healing properties with exceptional tonic and
strengthening qualities. It heals and strengthens the lungs,
promotes appetite, greatly improves digestion, and exerts a
pronounced tonic, invigorating influence upon the general
health. No other Emulsion is so stronglyrecommended and
so largely prescribed by the medical profession, and no other
Emulsion can show so many testimonials to its efficacy.

“Billy T.”: I put it to the new knight—
if the baker took a sentimental turn, and
insisted on delivering coffins to his cus-
tomers instead of cottage-loaves, arguing
“Life is real, life is earnest!” wouldn’t they
have legitimate grounds for complaint?
Other actors may feel as keenly as this
Caledonian stern and wild about recent his-
torical events; but fortunately the rest of
them recognise that the theatre is no place
for the tempestuous display of the artist’s
own personal emotions. Harry Lauder as
various ouaint Scottish personalities is a
delight. Harry Lauder as a pillar of the
Empire is an intolerable bore.
Died suddenly in London from heart-
failure, Wvbert Stamford, who spent several
years in Australia as a J.C.W. producer,
putting on “The Dairymaids,” “Gipsy Love,”
“A Waltz Dream,” “The Girls of Gothen-
burg” and “The Lady Dandies.” In the last-
named show he made his only Australian
appearance as an actor, playing Napoleon.
“75” : Desolate with grief at the death of
her lover, but <re-
taining a fine sense
of dramatic effect,
Sumako Matsui,
Japan’s greatest
actress, hanged
herself with a
red silk scarf, at
5 a.m. (the hour
at which her lover
had died weeks
previously), leav-
ing behind a re-
quest that she
should be buried
in his grave. This
caused a fierce con-
troversy, the
lover’s widow be-
ing urged to with-
hold her consent
out of respect for
“the awakening
moral sense of
Japan.” The lady
expressed blank in-
difference, so long
as she herself was
not put away in
the same place.
Finally the ashes
of Sumako were
buried alongside
the partner of her
hot passion, but
not in the same
grave. Seven hun-
dred people, drawn
from all classes,
attended the funeral. Sumako introduced
Ibsen to Japan, and scored her chief success
in characters such as Magda, Salome and
Carmen.

“Bunder”: When Walter Baker launched
his scheme for the transformation, of the
Actors’ Association into a trades union,
per cent, of the mummers in Australia gawe
it the bird. Led by Bob Greig they de-
clared that they would not be party to any
scheme that admitted fellowship with stage
hands and so forth. Greig’s oration was
seconded by a row of imported actors who
he-ah, he-ah’d at suitable intervals. lhis
and a block vote which Robert had scraped
up successfully diverted the scheme, and
Baker had to cut adrift. At that time
Walter and his stalwarts were fighting for
recognition for the local mummer, a plank
which commanded no sympathy from the im-
ported artist. Now the English provincial
artists who have been earning biv money m
Australia and playing leading business have
had their toes trodden on. The result is
the Actors’ Federation just formed in Mel-
bourne, and comprising some of the hottest
opponents of the old scheme. It will be
interesting to see whether the Theatrical
Managers’ Association lodges any opposition
to the registration of the Federation. On
a former occasion the managers won, because
about 98 per cent, of the members of the
Actors’ Union had ceased to be mummers,
and were filling in their time at other toil.
The managers can’t plead anything of the
sort this time, as the Federation is com-
posed of a large number of regular per-
formers who, although secretly in favor of
many of the objects of the earlier organisa-
tion, were too scared to come into the open
and say so.
SHAME!
“Six months elapsed between the first and
second acts."
“Yes, and that brute's wife teas still wearing
the same frock!”
“Norbell” gives the new Actors’ Federa-
tion Ms blessing:—
I have used greasepaint in Australia for more than
20 years with the best —and worst —of shows, and I
am satisfied that under present conditions it's a fool’s
game. I have rehearsed all day and every day for
three weeks (without payment) at a production
which ran for six nights only. I have rehearsed hard
for five weeks (gratuitously), and the resulting ex-
plosion died away in a fortnight. The helpless actor
is always exploited. He is the stock joke of the
union-protected stage-hand and orchestral musician.
Take matinees, for example. The brass-bound com-
missionaire, the proud usher who shows you into 6F
instead of 14H in the reserved stalls, the limelight-
manipulator, the scene-juggler—every Jack in the
theatrical pack gets paid, as he should, for his work,
.except the actor who gives the show. He doesn’t get
thank you, and, under the circumstances, doesn’t
deserve it. Of course, the management contends that
so many matinees per week are “allowed for” in the
salary, and are stipulated in the artists’ contracts;
but how many Australian mummers have contracts?
X began my bellowing with George Rignold. Day
performances were very unusual in those times, but
when we did have one the Big Chief always paid
half-salary rates for the additional show. He was
the only manager I ever knew who did it. When
King Edward died I was in Melbourne with a leading
co. The management reverently closed the theatre
for one night and most irreverently docked the
players of one night's salary, although, having played
a matinee, the actors had given six performances,
full measure, for that week. The same thing hap-
pened the following week, when the theatre again
closed for the royal funeral. The big railway jumps
that must be made when on tour constitute another
grievance. The property-men and mechanists, pro-
tected by their union, are paid for the time* occupied
during these journeys, and are provided with sleeping-
berths. The mere performers, male and female, are
not only not paid, but have no sleeping accommoda-
tion provided. And they must pay for their own
maintenance on the trip. I have been with a pie-
tentious show which, after a brief season in Mel-
bourne, skipped to Broken Hill, losing two nights en
route. After five nights on the Barrier we were
wafted to Adelaide, losing another night. After a
week’s work we were whisked to Brisbane, a journej
involving three nights in the train, with no chance of
even lying down; and no salary either.
When last heard from Julius Knight was
doing a preliminary canter in the “provin-
cial” cities with a comedy called “Uncle
Ned,” bv the author of “The Man from
Toronto.” The piece is being run by Henry
Ainlev. who also has most of the fat in it
as the star. It is by now probably on the
London bills.
Ben Fuller reckons that his Australian-
made Bunyip pantomime has a big chance in
London, and on his coming visit will take
soundings.
“COMMON CLAY.”
At Melbourne Royal they put it on.
The critics all were out for blood ;
And now that it has packed and gone
We gather that its name was “Mud.”
“Ancient Prompter”: “Eyes of Youth”
may not be a very satisfying piece to
seasoned playgoers like “Fax” (B. 1/5/T9),
but the fact remains that the artless Emelie
Polini vehicle has never failed yet in any
part of the world. When the last
mail left London it had just
reached its 230th performance at
the St. James’s, with leading Lady
Forbes Robertson as the star; and
it has recently been revived with
all its old success in New York,
where its quick-changing heroine’s
original exponent (Marjorie Ram-
beau) had her old place in the
cast. “Eyes of Youth,” I admit,
is in parts a very stupid play, but
wjfell-acted, as it is here, there is
something in it that makes it a
very pleasant entertainment.
“Terwin”: Years ago in Mel-
bourne a benefit for an actor’s
widow was being arranged. Eille
Norwood’s curtain-raiser, “Hook
and Eye,” was to be
on the bill, and several
of us laid claim to the
part of old Joshua
Gedling. After some
discussion, a would-be
joker, thinking to take
a rise out of Stewart,
who was onlv playing
Bland Holt utilities at
the time, said, as he
pointed to poor old
Bill, “One moment,
gentlemen—you’ve for-
gotten the eminent
London star.” Stewart bowed mod-
estly and said, “Oh, I'm nobody.
But, Mr. Stage Manager, why not
turn up the book and see who played
Joshua in the original London pro-
duction? That may be a guide for
you.” The s.m. picked up the book,
turned over the cover, and read aloud:
“Joshua Gedling, Mr. William Young
Stewart.”
“Fax”: Australia has almost forgotten the
beautiful contralto voice of its daughter,
Alice Hollander. She seems content to earn
good steady money as a singer of ballads at
the best-class vaudeville shows in Britain.
Perhaps she is wise. At any rate, whereas
the star concert artists had a cold time dur-
ing the war, the vaudeville prima donnas
flourished as before.
“J.F.H.” (London) : W. S. Percy has
scored heavily in “Oh, Don’t, Dolly!” the
new musical version of Burnand’s 41-year-
old farce. “Betsy,” at the Criterion, the
theatre where the old laugh-maker enjoyed its
14 months’ run in the ’seventies. The aston-
ished actor-manager Charles Wyndham had
then given it a few weeks at the outside.
Unluckily for Percy the present revival is
limited to a month, as Wyndham’s widow,
May Moore, wants the theatre for the
season she is starting on her own account.
“H.”: Marie Lohr is bringing the long
London run of “Nurse Benson” to a close,
though the piece could run a while longer.
The Australian girl intended to stage next
an Oriental piece by Robert Hitchens, “The
Voice from the Minaret,” but difficulties in
casting couldn’t be overcome in time. So
she is putting on an adaptation of Joseph
Conrad’s “Victory.”
“Harrison O.”: Marie Le Varre, com-
edienne in “My Lady Frayle,” wins my
valued approbation in several respects,
chiefly because she does not supply humor in
bulk. This is a relief in view of the fixed
delusion of managements, judging by recent
importations in this line, that they also
serve who’ve only weight. Also, her voice
does not suggest a circular-saw with a griev-
“Goodly Two Shoes."

ance against its owner. Her feet, which are
not like Trilby’s, might easily be a defect,
were it not that she is a divinity who shapes
her ends to such quaint purpose that they
are among her assets. Being an incorrigible
wowser, I prefer a comedienne who extracts
humor from her walking accessories to those
who rely upon their sitting-down apparatus.
“Stargazer”: Bert
Bailey, if he has
not secured a Lon-
don theatre in ad-
vance for his Aus-
tralian plays, will
find himself in sight
of a tough problem
in the Fog. The
housing difficulty
for actor-managers
in London is so
great that if you
want to be sure of
a theatre you have
to build your own,
and even bush land
in and about the
Strand commands
a million an acre
or so. Bert is
leaving it a little
late in the day,
too. If he had
opened up his
goods while there
was still a mob of
Diggers drifting
round London he
would have been
sure of a whooping
welcome, but if lie
doesn’t hurry he
may find himself a
stranger in a
strange land. Lon-
don has a short
memory, and in
about 12 months’
time you will find Cockneys asking where
Australia is, and wondering if the inhabi-
tants are still as black as they were.
“0.K.”: The management of Melbourne’s
Permanent Orchestra Trust Fund announces
humorlessly that the present income from the
fund, being only £2OO per annum, doesn t
suffice to meet the loss on more than three
concerts per annum. These are religiously
provided. Consequently a permanent orches-
tra is as far distant as ever. The fund grows
no richer. It keeps its capital and blews the
interest.
“J.F.H.” (London) : Lily Brayton is
supervising some new dresses that Oscar
Asche is introducing to “Chu Chin Chow.
The Oriental medley looks like running on
for ever. Certainly for three years.
“Peter”: The Repertory productions by
the Tait brethren tend to support my sus-
picion that the available amateurs are better
than the available pros, in this class of work.
I recall Gregan McMahon’s amateur per-
formance of “The Doctor’s Dilemma and
“The Pigeon,” which were more artistic
achievements than the professional produc-
tions at Melbourne King’s on recent Satur-
days. I account for the amateurs superi-
ority by the fact that they were in most
cases recruited from intelligent enthusiasts
with more than an actor’s acquaintance
with the plays, and were, furthermore, the
nearest physical approximation to the type
required that McMahon could select from a
very numerous following. The Taits, on the
other hand, had to do their best with a
limited professional company of long experi-
ence, but too absorbed in displaying man-
nerisms to understand that the success of
Repertory depends on the suppression of the
personal' factor. The consequence was that
we had all the evils of physical misfits,
declamatoriness and over-acting, not to men-
tion a freedom of behavior which allowed the
final five minutes of “How he Lied to Her
Husband” to degenerate into the crudest
rough-and-tumble, and also permitted a
spoilt actor to mount the model-stand iu
“The Pigeon” and deliver his few words like
a speech from the throne. It is impossible
to teach hardened pros, the Repertory idea.
Besides being in most cases too disinterested
or too lazy to read the play to learn the
author’s intention, they are further dis-
qualified by their incurable obsession that
their oivn personal greatness is responsible
for any triumph that occurs.
Oscar Asche has admitted in candid
moments that “Chu Chin Chow” was origin-
ally meant for a pantomime, but he didn t
care to call it by that name, and get only
about a three months’ run after all his pre-
parations. It has lately got closer to the
usual Christmas revel by dropping into the
Asiatic fairy-story a Peace tableau of the
Allied Nations —with Lily Braytor, of
course, as Britain.
“Glen H.”: In addition to acting and
“producing,” just-dead Edward Lauri had of
recent years taken to writing musical pb.vs.
One of his efforts (in collaboration with
David Burnaby), “The Maid of the East.’
was due for production in England about the
time of Lauri’s death.

*<Mr. Harry Tate, a well-known London vaudeville
comedian, has entered into a contract to take his
music-hall company of eight members on a tour ot
the world by aeroplane.”— Cable.
There actors are we know full well,
Who in the country from hotel
Or boarding-house in days gone by
Were wont to fly.
It oft befell these wretched men
Returning to the town again
That they beneath our brazen skies
Must walk the tics.
But now if pros, a quick escape
Must make from ills in any shape,
They can, with all their props and things,
Take to the wings.
And when the actors homeward fly,
Like swans across the northern sky,
The weatherwise will from it glean
Where frosts have been.
But when these constellations rise
To competition in the skies,
At least the Fallen Star will bore
This world no more!

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
BABY, CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Better than calomel, oil or pills to
clean and regulate liver,
bowels and stomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night, and in the
morning all the foul, constipated waste, sour

California Syrup of Figs—“Califig” is a
family laxative. Everyone from grandpa to
babv'can safely take it, and no one is ever
disappointed in its pleasant action. Millions
of mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, sick, feverish children. Ask
your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”—Cali-
fornia Syrup of Figs—which has directions
for babies, children of all ages, and for
grown-ups plainly on the bottle. Remember,
imitations are sometimes substituted, so look
and see that vour bottle bears the name of
California Fig Syrup Company. Hand back
with contempt any other fig syrup. Califig
—California Syrup of Figs—is sold by all
chemists in two sizes, 1/6 and 2/4. [<

Saturday at Randwick was more of a
regatta than a race meeting. In the Doncaster, Hem,
with little McNamara at the helm, sailed past the
beacon six lengths to the good. The avonie,
Publican, who was thought to be a lovei of watei-
sports, only beat one home. The St. Leger showed
Finmark to be easily the best three-year-old. lie
went out at evens owing to a rumor that he had a
“leg.” However, revelling in the mud, lie waded
away when five furlongs from home, and was a
dozen lengths ahead at the finish. But the most
impvessive performance of the day was Milliente s
capture of the Sires’ Produce event. After being a
bad last, and giving the leader a generous start
up the straight, the gelding won with comparative
ease. This raised the only cheer of a dull after-
noon. ....
The weather improved for the Cup, and the going
was reasonably good. On the day, and at the
weights, nothing had a hope in the big race with
lan Or. McNamara, Hem’s pilot on Saturday, and one
of the smartest apprentices seen in Sydney for a
long time, rode the winner. Nightwatch (Bst. 21b.),
a fairly hot favorite, ran a great race, but he was
not equal to giving the Martagon horse a stone
and a half; and he was a had second. Biplane
disappointed an army of supporters in the Flying
Handicap, which Palm Leaf took, after a good
race, from Greenstead. Bigaroon, son of Beragoon,
won the Ch.fmpagne Stakes. Multiform’s grandson
looks a likely Derby sort, and his chances of
improvement between this and the Spring are en-
hanced by the fact that he was not raced to death
Ss an infant. A rank outsider cantered home in
the Steeplechase—K. T. Austin’s very much aged
Bibbenluke. The favorite, Old Mungundi, fell.
Bibbenluke carried 10st., and was . nicely handled
by Moon.

Hem was the lowest-weighted Doncaster
winner in 33 years and the slowest in quarter of a
century.
# # * *
Arion, who won the Great Jubilee Handi-
cap at Kempton Park (England), last week, car-
ried the extremely low weight, for the event, of
6st. 3lb His, case probably resembled Hem’s,
though Kempton, unlike Randwick, goes to pieces
in bad weather and dries slowly. Arion belongs
to Lord Jersey and ran second in the last City and
Suburban.

Australian jockey Fred McCabe has had
a try at cross-country riding in England, and won a
hurdle-race on Wootton’s Watergruel at Gatwick. But
there are more jockeys than jumpers in England at
present, and, anyhow, there are no cross-country
events there during the summer months ; so McCabe
has decided to return to Australia as soon as he
can get a boat.

The Morphettville crowd enjoyed itself
thoroughly when it saw the local horse, Richardson’s
Dependence, get away last—not left, but still dis-
tinctly last to move —in the Adelaide Cup, and
come home by from three to four lengths from King
of the Sea. The King was greatly fancied, through
having won the local Leger two days before; but
Scobie’s Seabound was the absolute favorite. De-
pendence was bought as a yearling in Melbourne,
is five now, and has had a useful career. He car-
ried 7st. Sib. and King of the Sea had 4lb. more
AVee Gun was a bad third. Somebody took a. fancy
to the winner at the last moment, or possibly cover-
ing money went on the tote from those who had
overlaid against him; anyway, he unexpectedly paid
only £5 16s. in a field of 18. King Sea
was absolutely a maiden till he won the S.A.Leger,
coming home alone in a field of three; the mce
had been thought a good thing for Buckleys Cape
Skv. The S.A. Stakes, for two-year-olds, was an
even worse boil-over. Clarke’s Elkin was backed
down to 2 to 1 on, in a field of eight, and did
not get a place. A local colt, Allen and Yatess
Lord Setay, won easily, and paid £lO 35.; this is
the colt which did so badly in Melbourne in the
Spring. Bobby Lewis, with all his Adelaide wins,
had onlv a single previous. Goodwood Handicap to
his credit, but he made no mistake about this one,
getting Brewer’s Trillion home easily from Mrs.
McFarlane’s Petracia. Dividend £8 65., and £1
10s. for second. A. O. Whitington, secretary of the
S.A.J.C. since its re-start in 1889, was much missed
from the meeting. He was very ill and died a day
or two later. ,
It is just 30 years since racing got going
again properly in South Aus., with the passing
of a Totalisa'tor Act. Before that, things were
patchv. Thus the Cup just decided eyas only the
61st, though the first of all was run in 1864. In
1885, the local outlook seeming hopeless, the race
was actually run at Flemington. Since 1889
there has been no break, and Morphettville has
always been the \seene, except when early in the
war the military claimed the course for a camp,
and the A.R.C. lent Victoria Park.

A. O. Whitington, secretary of the
S.A.J.C., died in the middle of Adelaide Cup week,
and the assembled sportsmen gave him a tre-
mendous funeral. The Whitington brothers, Adel-
aide-born, took widely different paths, but all
climbed high. One is an archdeacon at
Hobart. Another, Peter, became a Commissioner
of Audit for S.A. (His son Ernest is chief-of-staff
on Adelaide Register.) A.O. had valuable experi-
ence in the offices of Sim Barnard and the squatter-
sportsmen brothers Pile; and when the S.A.J.o.
was re-formed, 30 years ago, he became its secretary,
having a great part in building it up to its present
position. With him dies a great fund of racing
knowledge and good stories. He was a valuable
friend to all pressmen, and would certainly have
been a successful one himself if his career had hap-
pened to tend that way.

The annual meeting of Tattersall’s Club,
Adelaide, re-elected “Paratoo” McLachlan chairman,
and Morris, Morgan and Claxton (the old inter-State
cricketer) on the committee. It was announced that
the membership is climbing up towards the 1000
mark; also, that stakes for all of the clubs race-
meetings are to be increased. Next latteisaU s Cup
is to be two miles, and worth £6OO.

he arrived here, he has won 18 races in Adelaide,

Australia more or less on a holiday trip.

It is considered in M.L. that Desert Gold’s
day as a racer is over. At her top she was a
quick beginner, and won most of her races in the
first couple of furlongs. Now she takes a furlong
or so to get up speed. With a galloner like Gloam-
ing about, the handicap is too big. She only won at
Taranaki because the gelding got a bad start.

Eleven started in the Brush Steeplechase
at Epsom (Vic.) on Saturday, and the only two to
fall came down in the straight.. It is a tribute to
the general high class of the jumping in Victoria, and
to the sensible policy employed there of providing
reasonable fences to race over. There is no objection
to big fences, and the more diversified they are the
better; hut they should be designed to give the
horses every chance of negotiating them, and with-
out needless injury to their legs.
The Broken Hill racing strike continues
with unabated fifty. At the Easter meeting, on
Saturday, only £lO9 went through the tote, and but
four bookies turned up to do business. The Handi-
cap event —the most valuable of the day—was. worth
only £45. # , ,
That hard-working lightweight, “Wave”
Geikie, scored another win in Brisbane on Saturday
when he stopped Dickson in nine rounds. Dickson is
game, but he was out-classed and out-weighted.
Havilah Uren mingled with Bert Secombe
at Sydney Stadium on Monday night. He starved
off with considerable vim. Secombe evaded immedi-
diate destruction; and in joust 9, or thereabouts,
Havilah was finished as an aggressor. Secombe
outed him in the 13th. Reardon beat Mulqueen in
the prelim. * * *
According to a last week’s cable, “in the
finals of the Imperial Services Boxing Championship
Captain Coghill beat Liei t. Lang on points in the
officers’ heavy-weight division.” Lang was a well-
know M.L. cruiser-weight before the war. Gordon
Coghill is the big, fair soldier who brought the
N S Wales amateur championship to Victoria Bar-
racks for the first time. He subsequently boxed as
a pro. without much luck. A bomb exploded near
him in the Ypres sector and ruined the classic
beauty of his countenance: he now has a twisted lip.
He boxed little in France. At the last big Baillcul
tournament, before the town was bombarded out of
recognition, he contented himself with refereeing.
Other Australians to win in the recent competi-
tion (which was open to soldiers from all parts of
the Empire) were Private Sellars (flyweight) and
Digger Evans (bantam).
A.I.F. cricket class seems almost as high A.I.F.
boxing. The Army team drew favorably last week
with a side which included such lop-noteners as
Mason, Douglas, Pegler and Woolley.
Eddie McGoorty picked up £lOOO easily
last week at the London National Sporting Club,
when he knocked out Reeve inside three rounds. He
outed Reeve here, and could no doubt do it every
day of the week.
The championship of easy marks from up-
country seems to be claimed by a man who has just
told his story to the Adelaide police. There was the
usual affable acquaintance, the usual third party met
by chance, and a game of cards on the river bank.
After he had lost £2O, a stake of £lOO was sug-
gested ; and, on his own statement, he walked up to
the city to be introduced to a money-lender who
would find the trifle of £B5 of which he was short.
Then one of his new friends left him at she front of
a big building, took the £l5 which he still pos-
sessed, “to show to the moneylender,” left by another
door, and naturally got lost somehow.

“Mack” : Two of us were in search of a
covering party lost somewhere in the blackness of
No Man’s Land. The rain was coming down in
sheets, and of course the guiding tape had broken.
There was nothing for it but to get on to our
stomachs and crawl. We had gone perhaps 50 yards
when my mate pulled me up short. He had heard a
metallic “chink-chink” several times, and ha(i just
tumbled to the fact that it was only to be heard when
a flare went up. We waited a few minutes, and then
decided to crawl a bit further. Another 20 yards
and we saw the reason for the noise. Two Diggers
sitting on the tiled floor of what was once a house
were busy heading ’em, and noting the result by
the light of Fritz’s flares. That’s the best instance of
Digger casualness I came across; and I know all
about the school on the raft when the Barunga was
torpedoed; and the Tel-el-Kebir school, where they
were headed on Gordon’s tombstone.
Balmain League captain A. Halloway
(“Pony” to club
players and barrack-
ing legions every-
where) is still the
headiest of half-backs
in N. S. Wales. He
was in the Balmain
XIII which won the
Premierships of 1915-
16-17. Last year he
played with the Next
Best v. Best; and in .
1912 he went with
the Australian team
to England under the
wing of the Northern
Union. On Saturday
Halloway aave his
club a push-off by
scoring the first try ;
the previous week-end
he notched two tries
out of Balmain’s four.
He is a likely captain
of N. S. Wales v.
Queensland and M.L.
next month.

Sydney football was more or less an
aquatic event on Saturday, and the web-footed clubs
came out on top. Western Suburbs v. Balmain
attracted 12,000 wet barrackers, who saw Balmain
swim home by 15 points to two. The other matches
were more even —Glebe defeating Basts by 13-1 .
Newtown won over Norths by 5-2 ; and Souths and
Annandale played a draw (eight all).
The worst feature of the day’s play in both
divisions was the goal-kicking. _ Of 13 League t'les
six were converted ; in the Union five scored out ot
21. It was not the weather’s fault. With the dr.y
ball on the previous week-end the kicking was just
as bad.

Six N. S. Wales Rugby Union clubs
sloshed from their dug-outs on Saturday and started
to struggle for the premiership. Uni. obliterated
Y.M.C.A. (32-6), Glebe-Balmain defeated Eastern
Suburbs by 13-6, and Manly jumped on Cambridge
by 16-3.

Richmond retains its position at the top
in the Vic. League game. On Saturday it met ana
beat (80 to 49) the patriots oi Melbourne, who are
at the bottom oi the list, so far, chiefly because the>
declined to play during the war. Souths overbore
Saints by 67 to 31 ; and ’Roy made sport of Don to
the extent of 118 points to 42. ’Wood went to Lee-
long and won —5 goals 19 behinds to 5 goals -
behinds. „
The shoot-off for “The Sydney’ match
(seven shots at 500yds.), for which 1? scored pos-
sibles recently, occurred last Saturday in a bliMard.
Eighteen got the possible (35) this time, and the
Association officials decided to split the prize-money
and save the bull's-eye from ruin. #
S’Africa’s belated tennis-entry has been
accepted, after all. The Association, however, in-
timated that the point was only sprung, as a matter
of grace, in view of war-conditions. In any event
S’Africa’s chances of coming- to Australia this year
are lightly regarded. # *
Major J. C. Parke, the great Irish tennis-
player, mav be seen in the Davis Cup contests, after
all. If so, England’s chances of taking

his remarkable victories over Brookes and R.. \\
Heath, and the following summer he defeated both
the Yankee champions, McLoughlin and \V Ilhams.
The N. S. Wales Hockey Ascoc., whose
season opened at Marrickville Oval last Saturday-,
has a great war record. Of the eight teams which
played—nine re-formed—the bulk are returned men.
Of the original 22 teams which comprised the
Assoc, in 1914, 83 per cent, actually joined the
forces. This is apart from rejects, who would
account for at least another 10 per cent.
One of the teams is a regimental affair from the
Artillery (Militia)— the only sporting team run
by any military unit. The captain (Colonel
Habett) “founded” hockey in N. S. Wales 14
years ago. „ ,

The threatened migration of the N. S.

Archibald F. McMinn (“Tiny”) passed

giant in the days of the now obsolete wing forward,

and he helped N. S. Wales in rep. matches at
cricket and tennis. #
“Obadiah Ren”: The Slipup District
Cricket Club having challenged their rivals the
Oldhills, a match was arranged. Old Mike Hogan
had been asked to play fpr Oldhill. and on the great
day he arrived in Muggins’s paddock, attired m
dungarees—held up by a red and yellow belt black
sandshoes, a cricketing hat that Mrs. Hogan had
picked up at a bargain sale 21 years before, and a
flannel vest. Over each shin was tied a bundle ot
straw, and under his ann he carried an axe-handle.
“Sure, an’ what’s that for?” asked Muggins, the
skipper of the home team. “Phwat, me axe-handle (
W’oy, that's me bat,” said Mike, and despite expostu-
lation he insisted not only upon using it but on
batting first. The first ball he drove for six. ihe
second went for four and the third smashed the
handle. Thereon Hogan walked to the foot of the
field, produced from the prickly-pear hedge another
handle, and continued his innings. Partners, at the other
end, came and went, but not even Gollings, the
Slipup Soofforth, could move Mike. With the score
at 300-odd, the Oldhill captain decided to “declare.
Hogan would have none of it. “Here Oi am. Mug-
gins, an’ here Oi’m staying till Oi’m outed, he
roared. The result of the game was a glorious
victory for Oldhill, and in the Oldhill Institute can
be seen to-day a glass-case containing the splinters
of an axe-handle, and below it a plate with the
inscription: “With the whole of which these splin-
ters are a part did Mr. Hogan of this town bung
the laurels of victory to Oldhill. Presented to the
town and district of Oldhill by 10 of her loyal
sons.”

“Ox”: Went in to try an attractive-look-
ing pair of boots in a Sydney pawnbrokery last
week. They didn’t fit, and Moses had no others
in stock. “My poy,” he viid, “come in after the
Doncaster, and I'll have all yon vant.” And still
the punter continues his imbecile trade.
Sydney Grammar won the N. S. Wales
Great Schools’ rowing championship on the Parra-
matta River last week by 2ft. St. Ignatius was
second. The contest yvas one of brawn v. skill.
Boy for boy the Grammar crew were pounds heavier
—barring the cox., who was 21b. lighter than the
Ignatius steersman. In the other events Grammar
won the third crews (fours) and St. Ignatius
arrived first in the second crews i tours). A fly m
the dav’s ointment was the unpunctuality of the
competitors at the starting-point. Sydney Grammar
is certainly a great school. In the past three years
it has won the premiership for cricket, rowing and
athletics, and at Rugby it was first in 1916 and
1917, and runner-up in 1918. They say it teaches
Latin and other such unnecessary things very well,
too.
FISH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What ,s that smell which taints the morning air i
What but tiie fish-shop managed by the State!
No one with any acumen or flair
Invests in leather-jackets, bream or skate
In tliis grim habitat of long-dead food.
Proceeding critically up the street
One reaches Bunkum’s, where the soles are good
And where the Murray-cod is hard to beat
Always provided Bunkum knows your name,
And is on hand to sell his wares himself;
That failing, what you bear away will shame
Your journey home in tram or train, though pelf
Has generously been expended there.
Never forget, in Icechests Limited,
That all the chill, stiff forms which at you glare
Have been for months irrevocably dead.
Haughty as Lucifer Squidoulos stands—
Triton Squidoulos, king of all the trade!
His breast with over-weening pride expands,
Not for the profits which the firm has made
(Though they are all that any man might wish),
But because none has ever dared upbraid
His entourage for selling rotten fish.
Never buy fish from females. ’Tis a tip
Which well may save the reader of these lines
From ptomaine poison’s agonising grip.
Woman, alas! persistently declines
To worry whether what she sells to one
Will keep until the household stove is reached,
Or, long before, be absolutely done.
Such is the gospel I have often preached.
And, finally, if you desire the best,
Eschew the city fish-shop’s fly-blown shelf :
And, speeding to the waterside with zest,
Procure some lines and catch the stuff yourself.

THERE IJS A WAY TO
PERFECT HEALTH!
That way is open to YOU. Will you travel it?
The only way to improve Nature is through natural
methods.
Drugs and apparatus usually show no results, and are often
injurious. Under my method fifteen minutes each day in
your own room are sufficient. 1 have thousands of students
in all parts of Australia and New Zealand who are now
enjoying good health. Previously a large number of these
people were sufferers from indigestion, constipation and
other disorders which are the direct result of the internal
muscles being much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health? Then why
not write to-day for full particulars of my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture?
This is proof of what I say:—
“Dear Sir, —I am getting along splendidly with my
exercises. My weight has increased 151 b., chest expan-
sion ljin., waist Ijin., calf Jin., forearm Jin., neck
1 in. “(Signed) J. 8., Bodangora, N.S.W.”
Many hundreds of letters from pupils all over Australia and
New Zealand are in the same strain.
I should like you to have mv booklet, “HEALTH AND
STRENGTH FROM SELF-CULTURE,” which tells about
my methods, fees, etc. Just write your name and address
across this ad. and send it to me, with three penny stamps
for postage.

Thomson Electric Welding for
Sheet Metal Manufacturers.
Here is a Thomson Electric Welding Machine working on wrenches. Previously
they had been riveted together—two men producing about 500 in nine hours.
The Thomson Spot Welder, with only one man on the job, increased these
figures to 100 per hour—9oo per day. Think of it! 80 per cent, increase in
production, 50 per cent, reduction in labor.
Thomson Electric Welders are adaptable to every kind of welding of iron and
steel, sheet, bar or pipe. Metal and Sheet-metal Manufacturers can reduce costs
at once by the Thomson Electric Process. We will be only too pleased to prove
this to you. When writing please forward sketch of your welding work to

Riding Trousers that will not fit you

ANY man who has done only a little Riding knows the importance
of having Riding Trousers and Breeches absolutely correct in

there, pockets not in just the right position, not quite enough “rise,”
end what endless annoyance and discomfort will result.

The Lady Northcote Permanent tiddlers
were batoned through a programme in the
Town Hall on Saturday afternoon. Lady
Helen sat in the south balcony to see W. A.
Laver lead his big team ; but the G.-G. had
business elsewhere. Dr. Barrett sat with
the vice-regal party in the balcony, and his
dame* listened from the body of the hall.
Jean Fairbairn was a picture in the balcony ;
and both Amy and Dolly Castles were in
the audience.
A new imported star tiddler appeared at
the concert. lie is Gustave Walther, the
Belgian who has just been attached to the
University Conservatorium. Gus owns a
gaunt face, bunched black hair like the mod-
ern girl’s “bob” cut, and a long, lean, frock-
coated figure. The critics disagreed about
his playing, but the house roared for an-
other helping. Walther then brought in a
Belgian pianist to accompany him; but the
piano proved to be normal pitch—not con-
cert pitch—and a tortured violinist ex-
plained to the audience the impossibeelity of
playing to such a thing. After which he
turned to the orchestra and spoke feelingly
about the horror of it all. And then he
just did his job with the precious Amati
which he had rescued from Antwerp. The
orchestra did good work, but was 20 men
short. That many have gone to Rigo, and
they were hard to replace because of union
troubles and the fact that Verbrugghen in
Sydney has attached so many of our best
musicians.
When the Peacock Ballet trailed its fine
clothes again (for the Women’s Hospital
this time) the King’s Theatre was packed
once more at prices running into guineas.
Lady Helen came for a second helping and
brought a big party of women. Captain
Conant was told off to make a before-the-
curtain announcement; but the limelight
man dazzled him, and instead of saying that
the girls of the Red Cross Shop at Howie-
plaee (back of Cole’s) were providing re-
freshments at their own expense, he merely
mumbled “Tea will be served in the lounge
during the interval,” and bolted for the
wings. These helping girls were in nurses’
dress, and Mrs. Percy Russell marshalled
them and attended to the motor transport.
For this second charity matinee, Lady
Helen, who doesn’t “approve” of vaudeville,
made urgent request that the medical stu-
dents’ nigger minstrelsy be cut out of the
bill. However, the management felt it could
not pick and choose among volunteer turns,
and retained the amateur sambos. When
the curtain rose on them her Ex. looked
shocked, and sat through that part of the
show gazing at her shoe-tips. She strained
a point to go to hear Harry Lauder, but
arrived only for his turn.
Three men were about to enter the Com-
mercial Travellers’ Club in Flinders-street
when they almost collided with a genial
drummer who had been dining well. “Hello,
Bill,” called out the drummer, greeting
Senator Plain ; “won’t you present me to your
friends?” “Certainly,” said Plain. “This,”
indicating the head of the Vic. Government,
“is the Honorable Harry Lawson, the Pre-
mier.” “Rats!” was the only comment.
“This,” continued Plain, trying to be im-
pressive, “is the Honorable William Hutchin-
son, Minister for Education.” “Lovely liar
you are, Bill,” said the “commercial.” “And
this,” proceeded Plain, “is Mr. Donald
Clark, Director of Education.” Clark pro-
tested that he wasn’t the Director —only the
Chief Inspector of Technical Schools. “Oh,
go on,” said the drummer. “I believe him
this time. You look the part.” “Evidently
we don’t fill the bill,” Lawson grinned to
Hutchinson. (The Latin proverb is “In vino
veritas.”)
The question has arisen whether private
hospitals that specialise in maternity cases
are in the habit of babies. A
young mother alleges that immediately after
the birth of her child she was informed by
the midwife and the doctor that the little
stranger was a girl. On subsequent days
the proprietress spoke to the young mother
about her “baby girl,” and suggested suitable
names for the infant spinster. This part of
the evidence is disputed by the midwife, but
she can’t get away from the fact that she
registered the child as a girl. Also the
doctor says he is “under the impression that
the baby was a girl,” and on information
received from the midwife he had filled in
the registration form to that effect. but
when the convalescing mother had been lo
days in the hospital, and was about to leave,
she was given a little bundle of boy and told
it was her offspring. The boy-baby came
as a great surprise to the patient, of course.
Moreover, it made her very angry, and
because she smacked the midwife’s face the
case came into court. How the alleged
girl was converted into a boy has not been
explained. There were eight other babies
on the premises when this disputed baby
was first talked about, and the suggestion is
that at least two mothers are now nursing
somebody else’s infant.
The Morrice Williams family are being
reluctantly farewelled before tracking to
Sydney, where the banker will take the
general-manager’s desk in the new London
Bank offices. One of the handsome daugh-
ters lately married Len MeOutcheou, so
she stays here.
Lawyer Arnold Westley has bought Mere
House, in East Melbourne. It is a snug
home in a big garden at the city’s edge, and
belonged to the squatter McArthurs in the
early days. Bland Holt lived there of
recent years. Mrs. Westley gave a sort
of political house-warming party last
Thursday. The hostess wore a cunning
magpie frock of black and white, which
suited her big black eyes and pale face. The
Weedon dame was muffled in sables and
wore a Gainsborough hat. Alongside was
Mrs. Stapley, another ex-mayoress. Music
was supplied by Walter Kirby, Molly Carew
and Norah Delaney. One or two naval men
looked in later; and Arnold Westley brought
Henry Weedon, who said a word or two
about his political aspirations.
Lieut. Jack Wischer is coming home to
Ivew—he travelled by the much-delayed
Makura as far as Auckland. Nearly four
years were spent in France with the R.F.C.;
after that 20 months a prisoner in Ger-
many. He was a schoolboy when he left,
and the family is getting ready to raise the
roof.
Mrs. Myles Thompson and the pretty
little Pratt maiden are giving a dance to
cheer up returned soldiers on May 27, in
the Gregory Hall, St. Ivilda.
Brig.-General Bert Lloyd comes home
with the C.M.G., D.S.O. and Serbian White
Eagle. The pretty eldest daughter of the
late Colonel Pleasance kept the home fires
burning while he was away, and was about
to leave for England with their fledgling
when the glad news came through that the
artilleryman was on his way.
Major C. S. Steele, who returned the
other day as O.C. aboard the Benalla, fol-
lows the same trade as Gen. Monash. He
is a roads-and-bridges man and won the M.C.
while negotiating the waters that separated
his bunch from the Hun. Mrs. Steele also
has a neat war-record of her own, having
V.A.D.’d in England during three years of
the conflict. Her dad is Franklyn Bilson,
who handles the grain-harvests of the pro-
lific Colac district.
T h e Australian
writer w’e knew
years ago as Francie
Elmes died recently
in London of ’flu. She
had married in Eng-
land, and was Mrs.
Fitzgerald Fawkner.
Two children are
left. The British
Australasian is
now making public
appeal for a Frances
Fitzgerald Fawkner
memorial, which will
take the form of a
permanent fund to
be used for the
assistance of hard-up
Australians and
Maori landers in
London. Mrs. Fawkner’s mother is living in
Melbourne, and there is a great sadness
amonsr the Australian friends of the bright
little penwoman.
Latest reports show that the house-party
at Minister McWhae’s homestead at Pens-
hurst, which was attacked by ’flu, is pro-
gressing favorably. McWhae, who had to
be represented by his two sons at Penshurst,
as he was busy in Melbourne trying 10
crush the disease which laid low his friends,
was much distressed at the death of Simon
Fraser, eldest son of the octogenarian
knight. Feeling his obligations as host,
McWhae sent down a doctor and six nurses,
and when two of the nurses became ill he
secured two more. Meantime all the visitors
conformed to the strict requirements of
quarantine.
Canadian Commissioner Ross is off to his
native land for holiday and business pur-
poses. His genial smile has helped to
relieve the gloom of Melbourne for more
than 10 unbroken years, and the call of
Canada was not to be denied. Mr. Ross will
adroitly dodge the coming Melbourne winter
and get home in the spring, when the re-
cently snow-bound earth is straining every
nerve to hurry up its delayed vegetation.
At a recent women’s conference Nell
Evans, a persistent barracker for the femi-
nine wage-earner, put up a vigorous defence
of the Australian shopgirl’s partiality for
glad raiment, declaring that the days of
“drab clothes and old gem hats” were gone
for ever. This caused “Old-Fashioned
Girl” to rush the Hekald and mention
severely: “The ‘old gem hats’ which Miss
Evans affects to despise are frequently worn
by our beloved Queen Mary, and what is
good enough for her Majesty should surely
be good enough for wage-earning girls even
in an advanced democracy.” The royal
Mary, of course, dresses the part. There
are times when it is reckoned that she ought
to look as though she approves of gem hats.
But the girl who arrived at work in a smart
emporium in the garb affected by her
Gracious on such occasions wouldn’t hold
her job for a week.
Young Lieut. Harry Vernon Pethebridge,
son of our first Administrator of German
New Guinea, came home by the Tras-os-
Montes. By occupation a mining engineer,
he has done valuable work with the Tun-
nellers and annexed an M.C. in the process.
He had a wife waiting for him at Ivew, and
a widowed mother fattening the calf at
Wymondham, Surrey Hills.
Miss Myra Mer-
field is the latest ad-
dition to Melbourne’s
lady barristers. She
is loaded with Phil-
osophy, Law, Science
and Mathematics,
and while making
for the Bar directed
a coaching college
where students were
polished for Univer-
sity exams. She be-
came a B.A. some
years ago and cap-
tured her LL.B. in
1917; but she had
then to be articled to
a firm of solicitors
for 12 months before
reaching her objec-
tive. A brother, C. J. Merfield, F.R.A.S.,
is attached to the Melbourne Observatory,
and sister Bertha is the well-known Mel-
bourne painter. The photo is by Sarony.
With due formality it is announced in the
State Gazette that Lieut.-Colonel G. H.
Knox, a returned man with a decoration, has
resigned his honorary post of A.D.C. to Gov-
ernor Stanley. A big. manly, pleasant chap,
Knox never seemed too comfortable in the
ceremonial job.
Still another appointment of a Melbourne
Club man is suggested. Norman Bayles,
whose pa was a Minister for a month or two
51 years ago, when Norman was starting to
walk, is said to have his eye on the vacant
Honorary Ministership. Anyhow, he could
then put “Hon.” on his visiting-cards.
Adelaide finds another week has flown: —
Influenza has been responsible for the cancella-
tion of the public schools’ annual “Thousand
Voices” concert. There is a shortage of doctors
and nurses, and the Red Cross and Boy Scouts are
organising bands of helpers for emergencies. Mean-
while the Port Pirie Counneil has been gnashing
its teeth over the bills from its isolation hospital.
The Commonwealth Club, whose membership now
totals nearly 600, has made Dr. A.* A. Lendon its
new president.
In four years the receipts of the South Aus. Sol-
diers’ Fund have amounted to £611,837. As the
committee has decided to make no appeal this year,
there is some discussion as to what shall be done
with Australia Day. The original proposal to
utilise it in launching a National Memorial Fund
lapsed when the Government announced that it
would attend to that job itself. The day will
probably be used for a big raid on behalf of the
philanthropic societies. Incidentally the Institute
of Architects has announced that a big majority of
its members consider Montefiore Hill the best
memorial site, and urge an honorary competition
for designs.
No proposal ever got less support than the
Federal Government’s peace celebration programme
has received in this State. Following on the
patriotic bodies’ decision to take no part in any
procession comes a decision from the commercial
and business men to make no trade or commerce
displays.
Mrs. F. W. Belt, whose war experiences include a
long spell of nursing in Russia and Roumania, gave
a lecture in the Walkerville Hall on Wednesday
evening. The May Club and Victoria League mem-
bers are to listen to her presently.
News comes from England of the marriage of
Mabel Law Smith, fourth daughter of the late Richard
Smith, of Glenelg, to Capt. H. S. Hudd, M.C., once a
member of the S.A. Assembly.
Governor Galway, presiding at the annual meeting
of the Home for Incurables, protested against its
name, which is, as he says, enough to knock out of
anyone admitted all hope or effort to get better;
whereas in these days of radium one never knows
where a cure may not be possible. It is likely that
the unfeeling name will be changed, just as the old
“Destitute Asylum” has been altered to “Old Folks’
Home,” and “Lunatic Asylum” to “Mental Hospital.”
Grandfather had an open and candid, not to say
brutal, manner of handing out his benevolence.
Felice, daughter of the William Hig-
ginses, of Malvern, has engaged herself to
Lieut. R. Bruce Smith of the 20th Light
Cavalry, India; and he’s the son of Colonel
G. J. Bruce Smith of Opawa, Christchurch.
Mrs. Ted Ilollingdale, of Darling Point, is
sister of the bride-to-be.
A laugh comes from the Merry Window :
Now, dinkum, is it fair to frighten all my boys of
the A.I.F. away by printing that I’ve been married
twice and divorced once? Oh, dear Bulletin, have
a heart — you’re uniting about my mother, not me !
I'm only going-on 23 ; give me time!
It was this way. Muriel Window —she’s
Harry Lauder’s chief support, you know —
was asked for her scrapbook ; and there was
an account of somebody’s two marriages and
one divorce. And how could a rushed pen-
woman guess that the cheerful Muriel had
put the life-history of mamma among the
treasured things that had been written about
herself?
Evidently our operatic stars are not going
to imitate the petty jealousies of their sisters
in other lands. Leah Myers and Nellie
Leach, who made the big successes of the
Rigo season at Melbourne Princess’s, shared
the same flat, and neighbors never had to
complain of the din of battle.
The late Charlie Addison, of the Speck,
might have made a pretty good living as a
society entertainer if his job as leading clerk
in a big wool-store failed him. Before he
had properly achieved long-’uns he was in
request in Hobart as a monologuist and
prestidigitateur, and of late years he had
shone considerably in more pretentious
theatricals. His Tony in the Ilobart
Theatrical Co.’s “Quaker Girl” was the
talk of the last tourist season, and if pneu-
monia had not taken him the other day, it is
not improbable that musical comedy would
yet have captured something of a star.
Melbourne pianist Doris Madden is.find-
ing her visit to America very pleasant. She
has met a kindly welcome from the beautiful
prima donna Anna Case, and Tina Lerner,
Max Rosen and Fritz Ivreisler have been
amiable to the clever Australian girl. She
has also been entertained by Mischa Elman
and by Heifetz, the latest violin star. Dons
played before the manager of the Minne-
apolis Symphony Orchestra and before the
concert masters of the San Francisco and
New York Orchestras. All gave encourag-
ing opinions of her art.
Walther, the violinist who recently arrived
for the Conservatorium of Music, lias been
annoyed with “opprobrious rumors” regard-
ing his nationality. The brand-new Profes-
sor was born in Belgium, and when the
Huns’ strafe commenced he fled from Ant-
werp “with only his violin and umbrella,” so
Dr. Sugderi told the University Council.
There are frequent parties for the blind
in Melbourne, and one of them happened on
an afternoon last week at the Masonic Hall.
About five o’clock Collins-street showed a
pathetic sight—a regular army of blind
making towards the meeting-place in twos
and fours, each group with one good pair of
eyes to guide them and the sightless locked
together in a firm armhold.
Dora Meeson Coates and husband George
have both been down with ’flu in England.
Still, the' two have been represented in re-
cent exhibitions. George is in the Academy
again this year, and lie has lately painted
the portraits of three Canadian generals.
The Arts and Crafts people have been filing
up the organisation for the boom that should
follow peace. All the old members were re-
elected and four new ones added to help stoke
the council fires. The new ones are acting
for members who are “travelling _ abroad.,
(The old game that is played with dads
cheque-book and steamer tickets is beginning
again now the seas are safe.) Mrs.
Courtenay is a new member; others are Mrs.
Argus Spowers, architect Muriel Stott and
Edith Alsop. They are planning some in-
structive lectures. Rodney will discourse on
architecture and Bernard Hall will talk
paint in the Verdon Gallery, taking his audi-
ence on a tour amongst the pictures to Illus-
trate his points.
Leslie Gordon, formerly with J.C.W., is
home again from France, with many stories
of entertainments under fire. He was a
member of the Ist Divisional concert party.
“The Sentimental Blokes,” which developed
into a regular theatrical co. Feminine
roles were in the hands of Victor Kemble,
remembered for a notable masquerading in-
cident in Adelaide when he used his powers
with deadly effect upon the heart of a legal
gentleman. The D.A.Q.M.G. of the Division
married Lily Brayton’s understudy, and the
Blokes were fitted up with many of the
costumes which have been discarded during
the lifetime of “Chu Chiu Chow.”

VANITY FAIR
Way back in ’4B, when William Makepeace
Thackeray penned his charming story, while
the woman of that time exercised the same
potent influence as her sister of to-day, she
yet lacked many graceful touches the twenti-
eth-century woman accepts as her right.
Among these not the least is
THE GLOVE OF SILK
The Queen of these, ruling by admitted
beauty and perfection, is
VANITY FAIR
which, while costing no more than the
ordinary Silk Glove, carries the maker’s
guarantee.
THE GUARANTEE.
If these gloves wear through at the finger-
tips at any time before they are washed, and
before the rest of the glove has had reason-
able wear, we will upon receipt of this
ticket and your gloves, replace them with a
new pair.
THE SYDNEY AGENT FOR THE MILL IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS GUARANTEE.
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
There were no lovers’ meetings under the
tree at Rand wick on Saturday. The wise
old tree was left to nurse the knowledge
gained in a discreet silence of many years,
while between races goloshed and top-coated
big and little ladies hugged the shelter of the
stands, competing for foothold during the
wildest flurries of rain with the Money Rag
who generously offered to change your soli-
tary note for a fiver. Never has Rand wick
seen so many umbrellas. Like some field of
hobgoblin toadstools they swayed fantastic,
unreal. Yet there was a weatherproof buoy-
ancy about the 22,000 enthusiasts. Lots of
soldier-lads and a group of grey-uniformed
nurses helped the cheeriness along.
Government House added a bright note in
the dressing of its lady, whose grey-velvet
cloak, blown open by the wind, revealed a
frock of deep-blue tones. A hat of the same
sapphire tints sat snugly on her head. A
small black velvet hat with brilliant herbage
topped the mole velvet worn by Aide
D’Apice’s soft-cheeked wife. The Ranee of
Pudokota smiled satisfaction over the family
nag’s win from luxurious depths of sealskin.
Mrs. Eliot, all the way from the Gilbert
Islands, watched the rain-swept course top-
coated in green cloth. Mother and daughter
McColl McGowan slung white peltry over
navy suits. Mrs. Roy Buckland tucked her
honey-colored hair under a befurred toque.
Mrs. Julius Caro and daughter Hilda brought
their perfect profiles and tailorings. Mrs.
Herbert Allan chose navy-suiting and mil-
linery. Mrs. Herbert Clayton, in black vel-
vet, displayed the only visible white feather.
Mrs. Campbell Galbraith defied superstition
and wore green; Miss Buckland, who list-
ened to “The Call of the Bush” with Snowy
Baker, sported black musquash and a chin-
strap to her hat; Melbourne visitor Mrs.
Driver rifled a Russian pony of its skin to
keep out the cold ; Mrs. Val Osborne’s furs
were amongst those present; and violinist
Madeleine Corliss was a symphony in brown.
There was also a lady with a chessboard
skirt and a black coat of the cutaway variety.
Spatted and close-hatted she might have
stepped from a Vogue fashion-plate. Then
there was the sorrowful little party snug-
gling in the shelter of the stands goloshed,
macintoshed, umbrellaed —and masked !
Pomp and circumstance attended a mediae-
val ceremony at Government House one day
last week. Everybody had ’em all on. From
the ballroom dais the Governor, in full-dress
uniform, handed Samuel Hordern the letters
patent of knighthood, at the same time pat-
ting him on the back for bis work in develop-
ing our primary industries. His Ex. also
took the opportunity to hand Lady Davidson
the bauble of Dame Commander of the Most
Excellent Order of the British Empire. The
Council of the R.A.S., Cabinet Ministers and
the Mayor formed the pompous throng.
Daphne and Diana watched it all from the
gallery. They thought the game such a
pretty one that they’ve been playing it ever
since.
Lady Davidson can now swank it with the
best Dames of the Empire. Her decoration
is the same as Melba’s. But wasn’t it like
that Nellie Mitchell to have six months’ wear
out of hers before Dame Davidson, with a
Governor-husband to pin it in place, re-
ceived hers for war work done in Newfound-
land?
The Warrigal Club has been harboring
General Henderson, who hails directly from
Maoriland, to which he was loaned by the
British Government to organise the Army
Medical Corps. General Henderson has now
shipped for somewhere east of Suez.
No Sydney woman ever had a more extra-
ordinary series of send-oFs than Mrs. T. H.
Kelly. The entertainments were remarkable,
not so much for their number and size as for
their variousness. Every imaginable section
of the community with sufficient money to
buy food gave the lady some sort of party.
Yet she has never gone out of her way to be
popular. She has a pretty wit of her own,
which she is constitutionally unable to re-
frain from exercising when occasion arises.
The likeliest explanation is that quality
which Max Beerbohm discovered in Ellen
Terry—she is “a good sort.” Her other
assets are brains, a gift for organisation and
a personality like a. Dreadnought.
There’s to be play-acting at Garden Island
on Friday for the Fleet. Of the two comedies
in rehearsal one is Pinero’s “Playgoers.” in
which Mrs. Roy Buckland, forsaking her
songandance specialties, plays lead, opposite
to Mr. Cecil Cohen. The theatricals are to
be followed by dancing.
James Clarke, king of the oyster that
pearls, was in town lately showing with
delight a milky trifle worth £33,000 or so.
The pretty lady is no new acquisition; she’s
known to connoisseurs as the Star of the
West, and Mr. Clarke locks her in a safe
deposit when he journeys abroad; but he
brought her to a Queenslander luncheon the
other week, and listened with beatitude to
the rhapsodies over her beauty. When one
lady gazed at the translucence, and mur-
mured that she felt like Cleopatra and
longed to consume the pearl in a goblet of
wine, a hand went out and the treasure was
towed into safe harborage. But what a
staggerer if the Prohibition party could have
pointed out that the drinks at one meal cost
£33,000 19s. 6d.!
Mrs. James Clarke, by the way, will be
remembered by Egyptian Billjim as the
owner of the house on the hill that flung its
doors wide when Shepheard’s turned the
cold-shoulder to anybody who was not an
officah. Many a youngster wrote home a
tale of motherly sympathy and good cheer
that saved him from being engulfed in a
wave of home-sickness, and perhaps worse.
Most of the papers, in recording Mrs.
Harry Chisholm’s return, seem to justify her
social existence by the fact that she is the
mother of her titled daughter. Actually, she
has been one of Sydney’s most striking
figures for 20 years or more; and as a war-
worker no one has toiled with better effect.
She and Mrs. Wesche well exemplify the
maxim that tins way to escape a war-decora-
tion is to do something really useful.
Very soon now
Miss Louisa Mac-
donald will leave the
pleasant place of
far-reaching influ-
ence which she has
made of the
Women’s College.
Twenty-eight years
ago Miss Macdonald
was appointed prin-
cipal of a college
which did not exist;
so she and her first
four students lived in
the old Allen home
at the Glebe, sur-
rounded by 11 acres
of garden and orch-
ard. There is no
trace of the spacious
grounds now. Red brick and mortar have
changed the old Glebe orchards into a dis-
tant memory; but the students of 1892 are
doing a living work. One is head-mistress of
the Brisbane Girls’ High School; another is
administrator of the Women’s Auxiliary
Army Corps in England. On down the years
the students have qualified themselves. Most
of our High Schools claim at least one of
them as head-mistress or assistant mistress.
The war knew them as- doctor, masseuse and
clerk, and of these many gained distinctions.
They inhabit our libraries, and the cool-
handed young woman-doctor you call to your
sick bedside has probably a happy memory
of residence under Miss Macdonald’s super-
vision. The London Free Hosoital has a
College girl as bacteriologist, while Prince
Alfred’s claims one as radiographer and
another as pathologist. Even the Linnsean
Society has admitted their erudition, and
the first woman invested with a Macleay
fellowship was a 1913 College student. If
all of which is not sufficient reason for
creating a record fund to enlarge the exist-
ing building, far too small for the number of
students anxious to enrol, what is? The
idea is to add a Louisa Macdonald wing in
honor of the woman who, among many help-
ers, has been the College’s greatest bene-
factor.
Vera Irwin Smith is the Women’s College
student who has the Macleay Fellowship. In
addition, she has a booklet to her credit:
“The Story of the Baby Kangaroo”—decora-
tions by Olive Crane. A booklet with a
serious purpose, of course.
One of the personalities at Princess Patri-
cia’s wedding was Mrs. (General) Kelly—
who was Maisie Kelly, of Sydney, before she
married a soldier, unrelated, but with the
same name as herself. Like her brother Sep,
she is something tremendous in the musical
world of London. The gift cannot truth-
fully be said to run in the family, for, though
the departing Bertie Kelly is a musician of
note. Willie, the politician, hardly knows the
National Anthem from ragtime.
Last week “Black Sandy” Jaques—so
known to distinguish him from his barrister-
brother “Sandy”—became engaged to pretty
little Barbara Gordon, the youngest of a
family of clever girls. Charlie Jaques, who
is shortly to marry Mrs. Owen Dibbs, is the
eldest of the Jaques boys. “Black Sandy”
enlisted at the beginning of the war, and on
Gallipoli he was hit by two bullets—one on
either side of the head. The effect was to
produce two ridges, running from his eyes
backwards, like permanent spectacle-marks.
lima Elliott, only daughter of Mrs. David
Elliott, who has had a home built for a
blinded soldier at Concord out of profits on
waste paper, was married in London last
month to Major John Caldwell, of Norlands
House, Lancashire. Bride was given away
by her brother, Sergeant Lindsay Elliott,
lima has been in London since the year
before the war, studying singing, and she
doesn’t intend to give up her vocal work.
She used to be a pupil of Madame Christian.
Madge, only daughter of the late Robert
Pollock (Lloyds’ surveyor) and Mrs. Pol-
lock, of Sydney, is engaged to Lieut. Roy F.
Ellis, M.M., second son of Mr. and Mrs. H.
J. S. Ellis, of Auckland. Mrs. and Miss Pol-
lock have just returned from Maoriland,
where the entanglement occurred.
The Rupert Clarkes are back from Maori-
land, and settled down in their Potts Point
nest. But the fresh-complexioned wife
admits she likes the Bayview week-ends best.
Then S’Rupert prepares the epicurean feast,
while she sets the knives and forks.
Mabel Tara, the only daughter of the J.
Barre Johnstons, of Neutral Bay, is wearing
a sparkling circlet slipped on tbe proper
finger by Pei’cival Francis Barker, who has
just returned after Si years of war. lie is
the third son of Mrs. F. L. Barker, of Stan-
more. Miss Barre Johnston organised the
Bariston Glee Club, which for several years
of war made music for Billjim.
Fifty-two Macleay-street will miss the
tread of Lieut. Rabett’s extremely well-shod
feet, and dancing Sydney will be shorn, at
least temporarily, of a consistent and
enthusiastic two-stepper. The young man
goes back to England, having only been in
Australia on furlough. At his party about
50 of Sydney’s 105 young dancing people
stepped it out. Tnere may be more people
in Sydney who dance. One has heard that
they have parties even in Paddington. But
the best papers don’t encourage such goings-
on. Young Paddington is expected to turn
its thoughts to savings-bank accounts.
Mr. and Mrs. Malloch, of tne Dangar-
Gedye machinery firm, have slung their ham-
mocks on the Euripides for the outward
voyage.
In March last, at the Protestant Hospital,
Genoa, died Susan, widow of William Mau-
sall, eldest daughter of Edwin Daintry, old-
time solicitor of Sydney; and in the same
month, at the same hospital, of the same
influenza, Laura, her only daughter. A
younger daughter of Mr. Daintry married
Edward Butler, the famous old-time Q.C.
Jean Curlewis, who in ordinary times
looks as dainty and robust as a piece of
thistledown, is putting in excellent work at
the Eadith Walker Home, nursing ’flu
patients j and that requires pluck and other
things. One of Archbishop Wright’s daugh-
ters is keeping baby amused at a welfare
cottage at Cronulla.
Jack Cannot, Sydney’s new singing
master, dropped into Katoomba the other
night and startled the residents by appear-
ing in evening dress on the concert platform
and singing the prologue from “Pagliacci.”
But he also chirped three comic songs, and
more noise was made about them, anyway.
Here is a little
picture of Mrs.
Teppema, the new
wife of the new Con-
sul for Holland. She
was born Delprat,
christened Elisabeth,
and became Carmen
when she blossomed
as a professional
violinist. When the
Delprats set up a
nursery for their
other little Dutch
dolls in Australia,
Elisabeth remained
in Holland to con-
tinue her mainly-
musical education;
for both papa and
mamma Delprat think education is nearly the
most important thing in life. Especially,
if you ask papa, technical education. So
the biggest-salaried man in Australia
watched one daughter (now Douglas Maw-
son’s wife) take science; another (now Dr.
Mary) take medicine (whereupon, in due
course, papa set her up with a hospital and
a practice) ; and Carmen joined the teaching
staff of the Melbourne Conservatorium.
That she will add something to the musical
life of Sydney goes without saying. At
present she is finding enough happiness in
just watching the play of colors in the
Harbor from the Clifton Gardens Hotel.
Leonore Gillies, who has been working
herself to a shadow repatriating the wives
and dependants of the A.I.F. in London, is
now lady supervisor of the Allotments Sec-
tion of the A.1.F., and in charge of a bat-
talion of girls numbering 218.
George Castles, who was gassed in the
great war, has recovered, and is in France
doing music-hall turns with three other
soldier boys. Eileen, the third sister of the
remarkable family, is making good in New
York in opera—grand as well as English
revivals.
Of course you remember the beautiful
Mrs. Maesmore Morris, who starred with
Julius Knight for a time. She has been
Mrs. McDonald Sutor for some years; her
husband is a tea-and-rubber man in Ceylon.
He is also in command of the only white
regiment in that jewelled isle. Mrs. Sutor
is coming this w r ay on a visit directly.
The first Australian nurse to acquire a
bar to her Royal Red Cross is Matron
Cashin, a trainee of St. Vincent’s, on active
service since the curtain rolled up on the Big
Drama. Just now she is o.c. the Litchfield
Military Hospital in Blighty, and is booked
to remain till things get normal again.
Home on a holiday with her children, Mrs.
Langberg, a daughter of Justice Chubb, of
Brisbane. Mrs. Langberg’s home is in
Korea, where her husband has big mining
interests.
Clever Helen Simpson, who only left Rose
Bay Convent the other day, has been practi-
cally running a War Hospital in'England.
Her mother, Mrs. Ted Simpson (one of the
Goulburn de Laurets), is a sister of Mrs.
Dalgleish-Bellasis, who married into the
“Catholic set’’ in London. Disraeli had many
.friends in this set, which is Conservative, not
to say reactionary, in politics as in all else;
and his novels are full of its prominent
figures of half a century back. Telford
Simpson, Helen’s only brother, is expected
in Sydney any week now. He did well in
the Flying Corps.
Miss Constance Waugh, at present of May-
fair, London, and formerly of Australia, was
robbed of £lOOO worth of jewellery last
month. The thief was a servant-girl in
search of a job. She seems to have been not
only an efficient property-lifter, but a bit of
a humorist. Asked for a reference as to
character, she gave the name of “Mrs.
Harris” —the shadow-friend of the late Mrs.
Gamp.
Gilbert Frankau has just been divorced.
He made a mild stir here five years ago,
when Mrs. “Ronnie” Forbes (also since
divorced) took him up. He and his novel in
verse, “One of Us,” were introduced by her
to Government House, but the dour Strick-
land found that both justified his darkest
suspicions, and they were flung into the
outer light. The divorce proceedings were
characteristic. He supplied his suffering
wife with the requisite evidence in this
letter:
Dear Dolly, —As 1 find it very infra din. to tie
continually followed by very inefficient detectives, I
enclose you the bill for room 507 of this hotel, where
I have been staying for two nights with a lady.—
Yours, Gilbert.
You can pull out the panniers of your
Peace Ball frock, for the event is definitely
fixed for June 5.
The Voluntary Workers’ Cafd isn’t rolling
down its sleeves because Peace is hovering
around. There are lots of soldier-liomes to
build and furnish yet; and meanwhile Mrs.
Bissett Ames arranges the home-made menu
and lures the musical bird to make glad
sounds.
Little Gwen Nelson is soon to have the
pleasure of sitting in front while she sees
herself dance in a film that has the magnifi-
cent Theda Bara for lead. Theda thought
the girleen wore too much in the Salome
dance; but the Australian was determined
to have the full quota of veilings. “It was
all right for Theda sitting up on the throne
out of the draught, but the judgment of
Heaven was falling on me with seven pro-
pellers working to create a howling gale.”
Theda, by the way, only vamps under con-
tract. Away from her job she’s just a jolly
girl, Gwen Nelson says.
From “Rosna” in London: —
Who would be a woman? All Australian Red
Cross workers, whatever their period of service, have
to pay their own fares back to Australia, or stay
in this cold island, if they w r ear petticoats. The
men, on the other hand, get free passages, just
because they are attached to' the A.I.F. and have
military rank. In the next war kindly see that
this does not occur. Maoriland does these things
better. Any war-worker of more than 12 months’
service is given an assisted passage, if approved by
a Board of Guardian Angels or something as a fit
and proper person to be readmitted to the Cannibal —
I beg their pardon—Blessed Isles.
Eveque is the newest millinery shade. Mrs.
Woodrow Wilson introduced it to Fifth
Avenue from Paris. According to a Sydney
girl who writes from New York, it threatens
to be the favorite hat coloring. There have
been forerunners of the bright wear in the
trim little turbans of rust-color henna, and
various other shades verging on purple, red
and orange; but Mrs. Wilson has selected
the one that will outrival them all.

Kapina: Sorry can’t follow your argu-
ment. Don’t you think that the quacks affect the
public health? Toniste: But “George Street”
and the others never claimed that the “Digger
songs” were anything more than the songs the Dig-
gers sang. They never claimed that they were all
Digger compositions....D.M.B.: Regret unsuitable.
But there is room for you in the Aboriginalities
column E.S.: Don’t know any cure for soft
corns. Better raffle ’em.... John Q-: (1) Don t
know anything about Alma Whitaker. She broke
it to us that she was a journalist; but no doubt
she’ll live it down; (2) you’ve met a lot of snakes
in your time, have you? Well, we were not the
licensee. .. .Proto; You don’t “sally gaily foith
in this paper—but there are others... .Test: Don’t
know, but we'll ask “Gouger” F. Norman:
Can’t read it. Buy another fist. .. .D’lnkum: Im-
possible to read manufacturing par, though it seems
to contain something of interest. Try another
pen Outsider: Can’t start that again Haerami:
You’re wrong—the longest straight level stretch is
on the East-West rails X.Y.Z.: No; better tap
a doctor Mulgaite: Very generous of you, and
very brave of him. But we can’t carry round the
hat R.F.C.: The dog-hanging yarn is labored and
unconvincing; the verse won’t d0....X. Sapper.
Not up Bcttie C.: That sort of stuff is no
earthly use for readers above the age of 16...
Orion: Don’t believe it. No Australians would treat
a bull like that L.C.M.: Horrible stuff
A.C.S.: You suppose “they are just poems.” Get
-the idea out of your head....P.M. (Gretna): Poor
attempt Web-star: Not enough there. .. .E.N.
(Hobart) : What on earth do you mean by “a rip-
pling fountain singing virtue as a mountain”?....
Hannibal: They fall down at every step N.G.
(Warwick): The verse is very ragged and jumpy.
M.S.J.: Too weak even to flutter A.S.A.:
Yarn has no hint of skill or feeling. .. .J. McK.
(A.1.F.): You might sell it somewhere else....
J.A.C.: Is it a puzzle or a yarn ?.... J.A.W.: Not
this time P.W.McC.: Doesn’t get anywhere near.
H.S.K.: Far too crude Simon Luke: Sorry,
not up Jonah: Neither story nor verse reaches
the tape E.L.S.: You can’t woo the widow here.
J. Mac: Hard to read and easy to reject
Cosmos: Truth doesn’t justify it Chanco : No
Gypo: Held for inquest Yarrum: Might be a
paragraph in it What’s Wrong With the World:
Muddled yarn in pencil. .. .Bushman’s Holiday:
Foster catches his eye in a lady’s toenail while surf-
ing. Fact noted... .J.H. (Q.) : Not up. . . .Cham-
pagne: Not worth uncorking... .Wanderer: No inter-
est A. Query: Have it your own way:—
Till then hope still lives.
Perhaps the critic kind of heart
Some small fragment gives
Of hope. With it would he part?
Fed up of it? You’ve a basket (perhaps
* small).
Well a rip, a tear and rend,
A flutter of scraps, that’s all,
Then it’s my end.
Mia Mia: Nothing' there Yarree: If there
were not so many of them about, it would have
passed for a shocking example A.H.S.: Not for
us A.G.M.: Not enough interest Rext.o :
“Eighteen” misses... .A.J.M.: Horrible enough to
be delightful L.M. (Hobart): The wild whirl of
it almost swept us off our feet... .W.H.P.G.: That s
right. Just keep on putting down words till you
strike one that rhymes. Then you get the effect of
bad prose with an occasional jolt F.A.M.: “The
Coward” drags a bit and doesn’t altogether con-
vince J.P. (M.L.) : Don’t like the Hell yarns
H.R.M.: “Glee Party” can’t sing here W.H.M.:
Not for us A. 8.: “Babies’ Paradise” doesn’t quite
hit us A.A.P.: Not nearly merit enough
G.A.D.: Verse all over the place A.C.J.: Without
one redeeming feature... .F.R.M.: Too feeble to
flutter here. .. .W.J.C. (Vic.): They all miss....
Bellerive: This is striking enough:—
Upon a smuggler’s ship
An old reprobate
Who, robbed of he’s share,
Attacked the mate,
While the bearded captain,
Strong, merciless and bold,
Smiled at the rage of
The miscreant old ;
When a bowie knife flashed
And the veteran grey
Sank bleeding to death
From brutal foul play;
When armed with a spike
Crept a young negro,
Who brained the mate
With a terrific blow ;
Forth rushed the crew,
And the captain fell,
Battered to death in
A mutinous hell.
K. (S.A.) : there are 50 writers who will answer
to the initial “K.” and most of them can tell a better
lie Senex: There is no yarn there R.M.S.:
The subject doesn’t sound attractive, but how can
we tell without seeing it? We endeavor to return
copy when stamps accompany it G.M.L.: Nothing.
R.H.H.: Ideas poor and verse bumps wickedly.
S.W.P.: Doesnt make anything like a story....
Alpha: Not within yards T.L.: (Q.): All those
words to say that a man got one drink too many
and wanted to know the name of the maker of the
sofa.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.M.: Yes, that advertising cry suggests some-
thing of the kind. But we can’t use it G.W.:
One of your tender first attempts?... .A. 8.. The
mild impropriety is old and you can t draw we 11....
M.J.: It fits the situation, but we don’t reprint such
things F.J.K.: Try it on a less religious paper
W.A.N.: Drawings look as if they had been
dashed off in a cab while racing for a train....
8.D.: Study hard or give it best W.11.C.: Work
like blazes for years —possibly hundreds of years
....George H.: Don't want to use threatening
language to you. Life would be brighter for us if
amateur artists didn’t produce such atrocities
Walter C.: Sort of drawing that would have suited
the American comic papers about 20 years ago.
“Rockton”: Our Brig, was inspecting a
draft for France, and by judicious inquiries
was ascertaining if each man’s kit was com-
plete. To one hefty bushwhacker he said
briskly, “All complete?” “No,” drawled
Saltbush. “No what?” roared outraged
Dignity. “No bootlaces” says Saltbush.

Mr. Percy Claridge, who made such

Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules: —
Owing a debt of gratitude to
you for your invaluable Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules, I
hasten to pay some of it by
writing to tell you what I think
of them. A diet of bully beef
isn’t conducive to a contented
frame of mind; indigestion is
such a wretched ailment—a dis-
peptic sees everything and every-
one warped. Suffering like this
I found a true revivalist, so to
speak, in your Digestive Tabules.
My digestion is almost in tone

I remain,
Yours faithfully,

MaKe Your Stomach Strong and Healthy.
Thousands of people who have suffered from stomach troubles and general ill-health result-
ing therefrom, because of a badly-regulated diet and the ingesting of an excessive amount of
food at the table, have obtained speedy and permanent relief by means of a simple expedient—
that of using one or two of Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules after each meal, or whenever any
of the well-known symptoms of Indigestion are present. These wonderful Digestive Tabules
contain the same elements as are found in a healthy stomach. They take the place of the natural
digestive juices when the latter are deficient in quality or quantity, and do their work for
them, removing the Indigestion by digesting the food and resting, strengthening and purifying
the digestive tract.
There is no other digestive remedy on the market which has been found equal to Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules; none which is so rapidly evident, or which removes
discomfort, banishes stomach pain, and relieves and removes all the symptoms of Dyspepsia
and Indigestion in so thorough a manner as these marvellous Tabules. They digest your food
and make your stomach strong and healthy once more. So try them for yourself. Sold
everywhere at 1/6 per tin, or large size, holding more than twice the quantity, price 2/6.

The Coastwise Packet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
/N the cathedral's majesty
The organ notes were rolling:
“For those in peril on the sea” —
Lee-shore and soundings shoaling!
The coastwise packet’s putting out
In wild and wintry weather;
The windy, wnite-topped waters shout,
All shouldering ner together.
From funnel thin the smoke-clouds brown
In gusty whirls she’s shaking;
Along her sides, as she rolls dow T n,
The sullen surge is breaking.
Then, as she reels her masts across
The skies that mists are dimming,
Like a white-breasted albatross,
Above the brawl she’s swimming.
The high light on the looming head
Is lost in sea-wrack scudding;
The low light winks an eye of red
To hear her engines thudding
In sturdy, measured throw and lift,
With steel a-toss and spinning,
Whate’er the leeway and the drift,
The coastwise packet’s winning,
As she has won on many a trip
Despite poor lubbers’ croaking;
A brave and lonely little ship,
She leaves a hot wake smoking.
Where black waves boil on rock and reef
You’ve heard the breakers brawling
'Mid seas upraised beyond belief,
You feel your stout ship falling
In hollow deep, in green abyss—
And which of you remembers
A wife’s or sweetheart’s quiet kiss,
Her eyes like glowing embers?
0 hardy, loyal mothers’ sons,
Who fear not the hereafter,
In fo’castle and stokehold runs
Ofttimes a breeze of laughter!
The coastwise packet’s lights shine out
Between the black squalls showing,
Yet burn no dimmer from each bout
With bitless tempest blowing;
As sideways down dim slopes of green
She slides, with rivets crying,
And lifts her brown propeller clean
To send the water flying,
Her smothered lights are lost again
To you across the waters —
Ah! surely these be more than men,
These sons of earth-born daughters!
Who stands so dumbly at the wheel
(’Tis Bill McCaw who’s steering),
With steady eyes and wrists of steel?
Whose cunning hands are sheering
The black bows from each avalanche
Of livid waves up-piling
That well a human cheek might blanch?
(And Bill McCaw is smiling!)
Perchance he feels there’s Someone there,
Where two or three are gathered,
Who stands each watch and does His share
On that wild sea white-lathered.
“Eternal Father, strong to save ” —
The music thundered slowly.
Maybe upon each ocean wave
There moves a spirit holy,
Which, surging through man’s heart and
brain,
Upholds each coastwise packet
Through thrashing spray and stinging rain
And black, infernal racket
Of pouring seas and jarring blades,
Of coal and cargo playing—
Imprisoned, grim fanfaronades
Across the dark seas swaying.
The coastwise packet’s rolling in
Through sunlit seas of morning,
Whose breaking tops bright rainbows spin
For her scarred hull’s adorning.
From funnel thin the brown smoke drifts,
And, past the bar that’s dreaminsr.
The blue smoke of the coast-town lifts
Above the white homes gleaming.
So. cleansed and chastened by the sea,
To her calm berth she’s swinging....
“/ asked her if she'd marry me ”
’Tis Bill McCaw that's singing!

Horace.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I RECALL Horace as a series of
vignettes, now faint, now clear. That
he had something to do with wool, as a
grower or broker or buyer; that he was in a
financial position to buy quantities of expen-
sive alcohol; that he was bulky and youngish
and talkative and patriotic; and that he
was usually to be found in the Hotel Aus-
tralia—outside these details his life was a
mystery to me. I met him first during the
evening of the day on which Britain de-
clared war against Germany. He was in
a bar. The falling of the blow found him
unafraid, even joyful. “It’s great,” he said,
“to be alive to see it.” He drank gaily to
the downfall of Germany, and mentioned
how the thing was to be achieved. While
the British Army proceeded by forced
marches to Berlin the Navy was to destroy
the Kiel Canal, take Heligoland and occupy
Hamburg. A colossal indemnity, the re-
turn of Alsace-Lorraine to France, and the
handing over of the German colonies to
England represented his irreducible mini-
mum as regards terms. The whole job was
to be finished by the following December.
There was something big, brave, spacious
about him. He made one think of Drake and
Frobisher; of Cardigan and the men who
charged at Inkerman; of Trafalgar and
Rorke’s Drift —of all that typifies the eager
courage of an Imperial race.
We drank many toasts that evening—all
of them patriotic—and sang many songs;
more particularly “Rule Britannia,” “Auld
Lang Syne.” and “God Save the King.”
While “Auld Lang Syne” was being ren-
dered, Horace for some reason stood more or
less rigidly at the salute.
I remember that at one stage of the cele-
brations the question of the Commonwealth
taking a hand in the war was mooted
Horace deprecated the idea. The Austra-
lian Navy, lie pointed out, though officered
largely by Englishmen, was rotten. The
men were ill-disciplined, idle and incompe-
tent, and in many cases disloyal. As for
an Expeditionary Army—well, everybody
knew the reputation the Australians had
earned in South Africa, and, anyhow, the
country was tainted with the un-English
doctrine of conscription. No! Far better
leave the colonies out of it, and allow the
good old Homeland to deal with the matter
single-handed. If we wished to help, the
thing to do was to supply food and money,
which could well be managed by courageous
borrowing.
He viewed Australia’s rush to the colors
with disfavor. I think it was the first faint
rift in the lute so far as he was concerned ;
the first check on his keen enjoyment of the
war. “You know,” he said peevishly, “it's
all damn rot, this enlisting. Why are they
doing it? For notoriety, that’s all. Vulgar
self-advertisement I call it; yes, and hum-
bug. They don’t mean to fight, and they
couldn’t if they were allowed to, which,
thank God for the Empire’s sake, they
won’t be. You only want to look at ’em
to see what they are. A lot of useless
wasters that want the six bob a day and a
free trip abroad.”
At a later period Horace pointed with
embittered triumph to what was alleged to
be going on in Egypt. “There they are,”
he said, “living on the fat of tlie land and
drawing six bob a day, which we — we, mind
you—pay ’em! And for doing nothing. Not
a thing! Fooling about in Cairo and enjoy-
ing themselves and wearing uniforms —and
men like you and me, men with stakes in
the country, have to pay for it!” Never
very articulate, Horace would, at this point,
become incoherent. He had a grievance, but
it was so vast and so complex and at the
same time so shadowy that he was unable
to express it. I think that even in those
early days he felt some huge, maleficent
engine gently pushing him, pushing, push-
ing. .. .To what?
I did not observe the effect of the Gal-
lipoli landing on Horace. He was away
from Sydney when the news arrived, and
for several weeks afterwards. Then one
evening I met him in the Winter Garden.
He greeted me with enthusiasm. “I sup-
pose you’ve heard the news?” he cried,
and before I could answer he ran on:
“Yes, I’m going to join up. I decided
to-day. Of course my friends are all
against it. They say: ‘What call is
there for a man in your position, a
man with responsibilities and all that, to
sacrifice himself?’ But what I say is:
‘Every man ought to do his bit, no matter
how he will be missed’— noblesse oblige,
you know, and all that sort of thing.” I
asked whether he thought of enlisting in
Sydney or in the country. He looked at
me in a dazed manner. “You don’t imagine
I’d join the Australian Army,” he said.
“Good God, man, what can you be thinking
of? No, my boy; as soon as I’ve settled up
my affairs and got everything into proper
working order I intend to go Home and
join the English Army. I don’t know what
I shall go into at the moment —the Guards,
probably, or the 9th Lancers; that or the
10th Hussars. I’ll decide later.”
The evening is burnt into my memory by
a rather disagreeable episode. The orches-
tra had struck up an air which Horace said
was the Russian National Anthem; as, in-
deed, it might have been for all any of us
knew at the time. Sitting a table or two
away was a middle-aged man. He was
dressed in rustic fashion and was drinking
tea and smoking a pipe. On his head was
the kind of battered backblocks hat which
such 'men are liable to wear. As the music
crashed forth Horace sprang to his feet and,
head bared, chin erect and eyes to the front,
stood smartly to attention. “What a truly
soldierly figure!” I mused. “How the Race
runs true to type through all the ages!
Crecy. . . .Agincourt... .Malplaquet.”
Suddenly the patriot’s attention was
attracted by the miserable being in the hat.
“Stand up there,” he cried sternly. “And
remove your hat while the National Anthem
of our gallant Ally is being played.” The
outcast took no notice other than to blow
a cloud of evil-smelling smoke in our direc-
tion. In a moment Horace was upon him.
Before the disloyalist could make so much
as a gesture of defence his hat was spinning
over the wooden partition in the direction
of the bar.
What followed was in the nature of an
anti-climax. The owner of the hat rose,
with portentous calm, and placed a large
and hairy fist beneath Horace’s nose. “Go
outside and get that hat,” he said. Horace
looked at the man and at the hand. He then
walked towards the passage in which the
hat was lying. The other followed. The
little procession vanished and re-appeared,
Horace carrying the hat. He placed it upon
the table. Then something of his old dare-
devil bonhomie flamed up. With a frank
smile, as of one who has shared in a good
jest, he held out his hand. “Have a
drink,” he said affably. The other answered
uncouthly that he didn’t know Horace and
didn’t want to, and that he was able to buy
his own drinks. He ended with the words,
uttered in low but truculent tones: “Get
out of this hotel before I chuck you out.”
Horace did so. He explained to me later
that nothing was to be gained by bandying
words with such a fellow ; that he was, soci-
cially, Impossible—in fact, a boor.
Over a year passed before I saw Sydney
and Horace again. The Australian Army
had done much and suffered much in the
interval. It was no longer a force to be
spoken of contemptuously, and I found the
opinion of the general public reflected in
Horace. He admitted that the lads had done
fairly well; far better than he personally
had expected. “It’s the old bulldog strain,”
he said vaguely. “You can’t better it. Most
of em are English, anyhow.” I asked if
anything had come of his scheme of accept-

In these trying days we need every ounce of strength and the
ability to do a full day’s work every day. The man or woman with
weak kidneys is half crippled. A lame, stiff back, with its constant
dull ache and sharp, shooting twinges, makes the simplest task a
burden and a full day’s work impossible. Headaches, dizzy spells,
urinary disorders and an “all worn out” feeling are daily sources of
distress. You can’t afford to neglect kidney weakness and make it
easy for gravel, dropsy or incurable kidney disease to take vou. Get
a bottle of DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS to-day.
They have helped many Sydney people. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
A PADDSNGTON RESIDENT.
Mr. Jos. Goddard, 6 Windsor Street, Paddington,
Sydney, says: ‘For some time my health was far from
good, due to the fact that my kidneys were very dis-
ordered. I knew this to be the case, as I had aching
pains in my back, was always tired and languid, and
could not sleep well at night. When I first began to feel
off color > I did not bother about it, thinking I would
soon be all right again, but this is where I made the
mistake. I got worse instead of better, and by the time
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me
I was suffering a good deal. A friend advised me to try
these pills, so I got some and, after taking them for a
few days my health began to improve, and by the time
I had used five bottles I was cured. I feel grand now,
thanks to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills ”
Two years later Mrs. Goddard says“My husband is
still well, and has had no return of his old complaint
since Doan s Pills cured him over two years ago.”
A BALMASN RESIDENT.
Mrs. W. Briggs, Store, 19 Vincent Street, Balmain,
Sydney, says:—“l was suddenly seized with sharp,
shooting pains across the small of my back. At first I
thought they would soon go away. But this was not
the case. They got worse instead of better, and I soon
found I was suffering so acutely that when I stooped or
moved quickly I could scarcely help screaming Out.
Dizzy attacks began to trouble me, and I always felt
tired and languid, having no energy for anything. My
rest at night was disturbed, as I could not lie in one
position for any length of time on account of the constant
pain. Nothing I took did me any good, but at last I
got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills and they acted
splendidly, four bottles restoring me to perfect health.
Several years have elapsed since my cure, but I have
had no return of my old complaint, so I feel I am safe
in saying I am cured for good.”
Mrs. Briggs confirms the above two years later: —“I
have had no reason to alter my good opinion of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. They permanently cured me
and I strongly recommend them to other sufferers.”

nesses to managers and give powers of attor-
ney here and there. I simply don’t dare
to do it. Without my personal guidance- -
well, I don’t like to think that might happen.
Come and have a drink.” While we re-
freshed ourselves he explained much con-
cerning the war which had been hidden from
me. Primarily and chiefly it was finished.
The Boche was licked. Beaten in the field,
he was also starving at home. A general
retreat to the Rhine was one of the certain-
ties of the Spring of 1916. “If I didn’t
know it,” said Horace wistfully, “I’d prob-
ably join up on the spot and sacrifice all.
I’ve been pining to get away from the start
—chafing like a hound on the leash. But
what would be the use of butting in now?
What would people say? That I’d gone
for the mere glory of it. You know how
proud I am. I’d go mad! No, I see my
duty—to hang on here and see the thing
through at this end. Have another drink.”
He told me then of his Work. He was
Vice-President of the City and Suburban
Anti-German League. The business of the
body was to hunt down all persons of Ger-
man origin and have them interned. No
half measures were employed. Germans
'Y ho had come to Australia at the age of
three; 90-year-old Germans; Germans with
Australian wives and with sons in the Aus-
tralian Army—these and many other varie-
ties were diligently pursued by Horace.
He also belonged to a rifle club.
W. M. Hughes started his first Conscription
campaign about this time. The first mut-
tenngs of the storm synchronised with the
admission by Horace that his apparently
superb health was a delusion. He con-
hded hrn trouble to a number of us one night.
He had an incurable complaint. It was
a skin disease, the symptoms of which came

re-embark for England before I saw Horace
again. I have never forgotten his farewell.
We were in Castlereagh-street. “Good-bye,
old man he said, wringing my hand. “Good
luck, and I wish to God I was going with
you. You chaps, the able-bodied and the fit,
with no ties, are the lucky ones. We poor
devils have to hansr on, eating our hearts
out yearning for the fray, longing to be in

clasp, and he turned sadly away. I saw the
bar-door swing behind his stalwart figure. I
was alone.
* * * *
A few weeks ago I got back again. As
I passed through the Barracks gates, in
quest of my discharge, I saw Horace. He
was in the uniform of a staff-major; on his
arms were the color-patches of the Sea
.transport Service. He Returned my salute
in a pre-occupied manner, and—perhaps to
discourage me from taking the libertv of
greeting him—turned quickly away. “Shake
it up, there, you men,” he cried, authorita-
itTVT6 t bo - a £ rou P which had just entered.
No hanging about the gates. Straight
across the square to the 5.0.1. Shake it up,
now!” “What is he?” I asked an n.c.o.
The man’s reply was terse: it conveyed a
slight upon Horace’s legitimacy. It seemed
that he had been “doing his bit” as o.c.
troops right up to the time when the in-
creasing activity of the U-boats brought a
spice of peril to overseas travel. He had
then accepted a position at the Barracks. He
was just about due for promotion, and was
looked upon as a certainty for an 0.8. E. in
the June list of honors. Pondering upon
Horace’s swift advancement, I decided that
it was a fair thing. Such men have a real
genius for at least one of the several sides of
the art and practice of soldiering.
10-2-4.
A Miracle in Mutton.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HALL, pastoralist, of The Angle, cursed
Mother O’Leary, his wife’s face
showed concern, and Jean and John
wept bitter, childish tears for Bunky Boosey,
who had vanished. Down by the billabong
Mother O’Leary was singing a cheerful song
about “the bloody Sassenach.”
“That woman —that woman, she’ll pay for
this!” was the judgment of Hall. “This is
the fourth in six weeks. She must have
taken the beast right from under our noses.
She must be running a butcher’s shop !”
The association of Bunky Boosey with a
butcher’s shop was too much for the bereft
owners of the fat, idle-eyed ewe ; and their
voices rose in a wail of horror.
Hall considered the matter for a while,
chewing the ends of his moustache. He
decided that the maintenance of his flock,
the happiness of his home and his peace of
mind demanded immediate action. The
Ford was standing in front of the house.
“That woman—l’ll stop her, you see !” he
shouted with such vigor that the cook hur-
ried round from the kitchen. He had
hoped that the boss and the missus were
having a real “box on,” and he was quite
disappointed when he arrived only in time
to see the car disappearing in a cloud of red
dust, the missus looking quite collected and
the children drying their eyes. Mournfully
he ruminated on the fact that if he had gone
out into tfie garden first thing, as he had
intended, he would have seen it all.
It was seven miles to the township, but
Hall drove hard. To Constable Casey he
explained the matter. The suspicious camp
at the billabong, the disappearance of three
sheep, and the climax of the abduction of the
household pet. He referred to the general
character and desirability of Mother O’Leary
as a neighbor with candor and color, and
returned with the Law beside him.
It was a two-mile walk from the Angle to
the river. They found the Murray drows-
ing like a brown snake in the heat of noon ;
cockatoos in a heavenly paper-chase were
strung across the blue sky, and in the aisles
of trees by the billabong pelicans were
marching.
But a tattered brow r n tent with a sapling
break-wind, and a wisp of smoke rising from
a fireplace of flattened kerosene-tins, held
more interest for Hall than the w T hole world
of nature at the moment.
Mother O’Leary was sitting by the fire
with a large frying-pan in her hand. She
was frying a sizzling cod, and at intervals
she plucked a titbit and threw it to a pair
of waddling wood duck that flapped their
clipped wings. Four browrn, dirty children sat
around her in various stages of lack of
clothing and amplitude of tatters and watched
.the performance.
They saw the visitors first and fled for the
tent. A fox, which was treading an endless
track around the base of a gum to which
it was chained, paused for a moment and
regarded the intruders with red eyes.
Mother O’Leary spat.
“Good day,. Mother. How’s the cod?”
asked the constable with a twinkle in his
eye as lie caught the questioning glance
which surveyed him and the man of many
sheep who stood beside him.
“None of yer palaver,” said the old woman
with deliberation. “Faith, a fine son of
Ireland y’may call yourself to come
a-troubling the mother of five, and her man
gone down the river on a wood-boat and
forgot to come back and him in Adelaide now
they do say. And here come yeh to look
into an old woman’s pan and see wdiat bite
she’s got for the young ’uns.”
“Seeing the season don’t open for a
month it’s a wonder it isn’t duck,” suggested
Constable Casey, inviting further trouble.
“And supposin’ it was duck?” she re-
torted with vigor. “You with yer pay from
the Giv’nment, yer house in the big street
and yer tappin’ at the pub doors after hours
and all! What if a woman did get a bit
of wild bird, with her husband down in town
and her in a tent? And if yer thinking
that Jimmie’s out in the scow, he ain’t.
And if he is the gun’s in the tent where
y’may see. So y’know.”
“You might tell me one more thing,” sug-
gested Constab]e Casey, pleasantly, as Hall
began to shuffle impatiently. “And where
is the sheep you took last night from the
Ansrle?”
“Now, Mother of all the Saints, did ever
y’ hear the like?” said Mother O’Leary. “Did
y’ now? You’re a blot cornin’ here, but when
yeh say a thing like that to a woman with
her children round her and her man away
yeh should be struck!”
Then the Law grew firm, though with the
reservations which were necessary while the
brown hands held the frying-pan.
Hall began to regret his decision to seek
vengeance for the disappearance of Bunky
Boosey. The place smelt of fox; small chii-
dren with sharp eyes watched him from the
bushes, and the flies paddled their feet in the
moisture on his brow. Thoughts of Bunky
Boosey were lost in the stream of cross-talk
which poured between the law-enforcing and
thp law-defying as Casey searched the camp.
The constable worked thoroughly, seeking
through the tent, the cleared patch and the
scrub, but the place was as bare of meat or
wool as a grindstone.
Hall sat on a stump and fought the ants
off till Casey joined him.
“ ’Tis no good,” he retorted. “Not a trace,
and your suspicions wouldn’t convince the
P.M.
The decision was welcome, and they left
with Mother O’Leary’s awful prophecies of
dreadful things swarming round their heads.
She followed them in order to supply good
measure, but her voice rose shriller' when
Constable Casey paused by the billabong.
He sought out a long stick and began to
fish for a piece of log floating on the sur-
face. The innocent slab was brought within
reach, and with it the end of a rope. While
the voice prophesied evil fates to the eighth
generation, the rope was hauled in and the
barrel at the other end rested on the bank.
The Law glanced at Mother O’Leary, then
got an axe, and, while Hall looked on with
the terrible light of the victor in his eye,
beat in the top of the cask. The blows feli
to the accompaniment of a chant of doom.
The wood splintered and the secret of the
barrel was revealed—the skull of a steer,
bleached white and clean by years of ex-
posure !
Constable Casey hurled the axe back to
the camp and followed Hall, who was flee-
ing—fleeing from the hateful camp, from the
smell of fox, from the barrel and from the
endless tongue.
Neither of them looked back to gee
Mother O’Leary down on her knees thank-
ing the Lord God who had worked a miracle
for her.
The wood-cutters at the camp on the other
bank, who had seen the barrel submerged
late on the previous evening, were enjoying
mutton for dinner.
DALE COLLINS.
Cleopatra.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What could a Roman maiden mean to thee
Adown the ages destined to be mine,
O laurelled Antony?
A golden net I bound about thy heart
And meshed thy soul with lore;
My glowing beauty, like a full-orbed moon,
Startled thine eyes and kissed thy latent
blood
Until thou sawest me stand against the sun
Of thy desire, just melting to thy mood,
Not wholly won, yet not unconquerable—
A queen forgetful of her former pride....
Ah, I did meet thee as the desert meets
Unwary those who dream not of its might,
And, folding them tenacious in its arms,
Keeps them as captives loved, by love
destroyed.
What though the w r orld with multiple alarms
Did seek to take thee from my lips’ rare
wine,
Death was our host, and at his banquet
board,
O Antony, I gave my soul with thine!

The Medicine for Yon
must possess certain advantages without which it would hardly commend
itself to your confidence. It must be perfectly safe under all circumstances.
It must be mild in its action but none the less efficacious on that account.
It must be, par excellence, a family medicine, that is, suitable for
old and young of both sexes and be freely obtainable in town or
country. It must be easy to take, regular and reliable in its curative
effects and possess a great and genuine record of success. Such a
medicine is Beeeham’s Pills which still hold, and will continue to hold,
the highest position in popular favour. It is very interesting, after so
many years service, still to find Beeeham’s Pills “at the top of the
tree” among digestive remedies. They ar - everywhere acknowledged
to be unrivalled in the treatment of such troubles as biliousness, sick

of blood and a general run-down condition. If you are in any way a
