The Red Page
Cloak and Sword
The period novel is a response to the
popular impression that other times and
ways were necessarily more picturesque.
Ancient manor-houses, mellow brick
walls, spacious gardens, fragrant airs
and unspoiled woods and highways
are the period novelist’s stock-in-
trade ; a world of brave men anc
lovely women with manners as elabo
rate as their clothes. Readers who fo
get that these gentlefolk were ofte
illiterate and rarely changed their clothe
or had a bath (one bath a year was th
allowance of a fashionable beauty lik
Lady Melbourne as late as the first qua
ter of the nineteenth century) may be
come intensely interested in them. Jeffer
Farnol has a faculty that approache
genius for making country squires ant
their womenfolk of a couple of centurie
ago seem more intelligent, cultivated anc
in every way desirable than contem
porary men and women who enjoy th
advantages of modern education and us
plenty of soap and proportionately les
scent. The Way Beyond (Sampson Low
Robertson and Mullens ; 7s. 6d.) is th
latest example of his art.
Romance
The heroine is lovely Rosemary Fore,
governess to the children of Lady Beding
ham, who comes to stay with the Ear
of Abbeymere—her brother and an excep
tionally cynical and lecherous alcoholist
Young Lord I ford, the Earl’s heir, ant
Richard Vibart, son of Sir Peter, are in
love with Rosemary, and the Earl has hi
infamous eye on her, too. In an attemp:
to encompass his vile designs he is killed.
By whom? We suspect poor Rosemary
So does Richard, who reaches the scene
shortly after the crime has been com
milted, and leaves a handkerchie’
marked “R.V.” near the body. Lord Iford
arrives next and finds the handkerchief
A puzzling character this. Ostensibly he
is the second villain. Swaying slightly
for he is drunk as usual, he apostrophises
the corpse:—
“So, my lord, there you are at last! The
death you have invited so frequently ant
merited so long, has you at last!”
And much more to the same effect
But he doesn’t confront his rival with
the handkerchief. Instead, he makes it
appear that the Earl has committee
suicide. Meanwhile Richard has bolteo
to divert suspicion from Rosemary to
himself.
Rosemary is the personification of
maidenly gentleness and pathos. In
headlong flight she reaches a great
tree “that, for her sake, Richard would
have kissed once upon a time and which
she loved and whereto she had fled for
Richard’s sake.”
It seemed to her stricken heart as if the
dear, great thing were striving to comfort her,
wherefore she kissed it out of very gratitude.
Oho, thou Tree of trees to have felt the soft
pressure of those tender, lovely lips!
Mr. Farnol’s handling of Rosemary is
probably one of the secrets of his wide
appeal. She is glucose all through ; an
emotional girl-child with all the sweetest
traits of Mary Pickford and Janet Gay-
nor in their sweetest parts, and a frailer
and more wistful loveliness than either
of them.
The death of the young Earl (who was
no villain after all) will cause many a
sniff and not a few howls. Little Jane
is sitting on his bed weaving a daisy-
chain.
“Light!” gasped the Earl. “Draw the cur-
tains give us light! Now, little Jane, dear
....small Fairy Godmother... .cast me a
spell a triffic spell and turn me into
a Fairy Prince for ever....and ever....”
This is emphatically the stuff to give
the sentimentalists who constitute a large
majority of the novel-reading public.
And only about one writer in a thousand
is capable of giving it to them.
Realism
Gentlemen —the Regiment!, by Hugh
Talbot (Dent; 7s. 6d.), also has a
lachrymose and somewhat improbable
love story, but the sentimental passages
are subsidiary to
the realistic main
theme. The book
is bound to in-
terest those who
served under Im-
perial officers or
n.c.os. during the world war, if only for
the lights it casts on the origins of British
military discipline. Also, there are some
inspired descriptions of warfare as it was
waged in the middle of last century.
The story is, in part, a history of two
rival regiments, the 137th and 138th Foot.
Raised and quartered in the same county,
they were officered largely by Chappells
and St. Quentyns respectively. Alastair
Chappell gets expelled from school and
enlists in the 137th. One of his first ex-
periences is a route-march which recalls
Moascar. A man near him is about to
collapse: “his eyes were closed and drops
of sweat were pouring off his ashy fore-
head.” A captain passes ; Alastair draws
his attention to the man, and has his
name taken for insolence.
“Men of the 137th aren’t done till they drop
in their paces.” And Captain Higgins rode
forward.
A discussion which Alastair has later
with one of his uncles is significant.
“Nobody whips a tired horse up a hill,”
says the uncle. “No gentleman, any-
how.” “No, sir,” replies Alastair ; “but
they do soldiers.”
When Alastair gets his commission
the question of the treatment of the other
ranks comes up again, and his Colonel
talks tp him in confidence-. Private sol-
diers are underpaid, badly housed and
fed, despised by the public. “We [officers]
do what we can for them—and punish
heavily ; otherwise they would be a rebel-
lious rabble.”
The two regiments go into action at
Sebastopol. The drums are beaten, the
lines dressed, the colors paraded. They
march off across rough ground, with
shells and round-shot sizzling over, and
sergeants yelling the step and occasion-
ally taking the names of slack marchers.
They get near the enemy. “Fire a vol-
ley!” There is a snapping of muskets,
but most of them are too wet to fire.
The armies meet in wild confusion, and
Alastair finds himself “locked tight in a
shifting mass, unable to move his arms,
being swept downhill.”
He suddenly saw a red, loutish ear. He bit
it. 'I here was an astonished yell, a stark,
furious lace with wild-cat eyes, which shrieked
unintelligible abuse. Alastair roared with laugh-
ter and spat full into the open mouth....
they were going downhill steeply now, and
he was face to face with an officer, dark,
young, sallowly handsome. They could neither
of them move hand or arm. They smiled at
each other. “Bloody crowded battle, this!”
Alastair shouted. The officer nodded and smiled
again, as if he understood. We might have
been friends, Alastair thought.
Mr. Talbot doesn’t try to make fight-
ing seem romantic, or even heroic, and,
perhaps for that reason, his battle pic-
tures are intensely alive. Many are so
alive that it is hard to believe they were
imagined. They read as if he has had
access to the letters of an observant,
truthful soldier of the period ; or he may
have known someone who knew a
Crimean veteran with a good memory
and no illusions about his profession.

New States
U. R. Ellis’s New Australian states
(Endeavour Press ; 65.) has been published
at an opportune moment, for the N. S.
Wales New States Commission is in ses-
sion. Mr. Ellis, who is secretary to
the Federal Country party leader and the
director appointed to prepare the case for
Riverina separation, naturally takes a par-
tisan view. His crusading zeal sometimes
imparts a warmth of expression to his
opinions which may not appeal to his
opponents. It does not, however, affect
his facts, which he states, pro and con,
fully and reasonably fairly.
The struggle for subdivision began
almost with the foundation of Australia
as a settlement. Tasmania was the first
region to fight for independence, which it
secured in 1825. The opposition which its
residents had from Governor Sorrell and
the Sydney authorities, however, was
nothing to that which awaited Victorians
and Queenslanders. Both achieved self-
government, though neither was satisfied
with the territories allotted. Almost to the

pion equally of Moreton Bay, which he
represented in the N. S. Wales Legislative
Council, and of the Riverina movement,
which he founded in 1856 —incidentally
giving the name Riverina to the district.
The fight in that area was acute in the
’fifties and ’sixties, largely because of
representation and official difficulties. The
press of 1851 was able to report with
relief that
The Honorable Member for the Tumut
Electoral District has succeeded after an adven-
turous journey in reaching Sydney in safety
and has taken his seat in the House.
The growing coteries of settlers found
themselves hundreds of miles from courts
of justice. Witnesses had to travel for
weeks on foot,
over trackless plains and bridgeless rivers,
with considerable risk and not infrequent loss
of life. Some, who could afford it, found
themselves out of pocket by £lOO over the trip.
When faster communications alleviated
these conditions agitation died down ; and,
while it blazed a little occasionally,
especially during the years in which the
Australian Constitution was being framed,
it did not become really vital again until
the Lang regime in N. S. Wales in 1931
spurred the Hardy movement into exist-
ence.
During the interval, however, the same
sort of difficulties as beset the South
began to affect the Far North. The sub-
division urge which, under the shadow
of Macrossan in Townsville in February,
1882, rose from the almost cold ashes of
Dr. Lang’s seven-provinces scheme was
a more vigorous growth than that behind
the old Riverina and New England move-
ments. Distances were greater, com-
munity of interest with Brisbane was non-
existent and it was a fetich, particularly
in the Far North —the words are those of
the late A. G. Stephens—that
an archangel’s voice in Herberton is reduced
to penny-whistle proportions by the time it
reaches the ear of the dispensing Queen-street
bureaucrat, and a fleabite in Toowoomba has
immensely more significance than a massacre of
Christians in the Gulf country.
With persistent champions like Macros-
san, George Curtis, Archer and Corfield
behind it and Griffith willing to oblige
everybody, the agitators persuaded the
Government to pass a bill through the
Assembly for constituting Queensland
into a sort of Commonwealth of minor
nations, with a Senate and a House of
Representatives and subsidiary provin-
cial Parliaments; but the Upper House
threw cold water on it. The venue of
the fight was changed from the State
Parliament to the Federal Conventions,
but after the Commonwealth became an
accomplished fact the struggle became
more and more desultory. It only came
to life again when Earle Page became
an M.P. after the war and the Country
party entered the Federal arena.
Mr. Ellis’s book is essentially one for
the student and the Parliamentarian, who
will find the facts in it well arranged
both as to chronology and method. There
are several texts of vital documents as
appendices, an unusually good and ex-
tensive index, a bibliography and three
explanatory maps.
On the whole the book is a valuable
and authoritative addition to Australian
political literature. It will be invalu-
able to Parliamentarians and students of
rural Australian politics.
M. H.
An Appeal for Proportion
Professor Allen, president of the
Society of Arts and Literature at Can-
berra, contributed some bitter truths to
“Prometheus” the other day.
What literary or artistic brains we have we
do our best to expel. If a man has the ability
to follow a profession he will forsake literature,
and if he has not the ability to forsake litera-
ture he will forsake Australia.
When our writers and artists get on in
years and become successes abroad, they
can settle down here and be reasonably
happy, no doubt. George Lambert was
a case in point. But before that they
are, mentally, wandering spirits in a
strange land: the whole flow of life in
Australia is against them ; and what the
young crave for more than anything is
comradeship, understanding, kindred en-
thusiasm.
But who cares about poetry? Who’s
interested in novel-writing? That’s all
nonsense, and you should give it up and
get a good steady job. If poetry doesn’t
interfere with your work, we will toler-
ate it in your spare time.
Sport is different. Cricket? If you
have a cricket career ahead of you you
are important, and your career is im-
portant, and we will help you to con-
centrate on that. A not-too-strenuous job
will be provided for you, so that you may
play your cricket in comfort. And if
you are reasonably successful you will
soon be earning money a poet only
dreams of. If you are very successful
you will be the cynosure of all eyes ;
there will be not a soul in Australia who
won’t know your name. You will be
broadcast and written up and petted and
pampered and considered, and the flap-
pers will say, with sincerity in their
voices, “Oh, I think he’s marvellous!”
and endow you with a thousand moral,
mental and (Esthetic attributes you don’t
possess.
This is not a complaint. It is a fact,
and human nature can’t be altered. The
majority of people all over the world are
more interested in the physical than the
mental. The only difference between
Australia and Europe is that Australia
has a small population spread over
a large area and Europe a large
population packed into a small area;
and, consequently, though the pro-
portion of those interested in ideas
may be the same in both places, the
actual numbers of them are few and
scattered and lonely in Australia.
But when the next Tests start, and
Australia is loud with cricket and obli-
vious to all else, the enthusiasts might
remember that the result will not change
the history of the world, and that there
are, strange as it seems, achievements
worthier and more difficult to accom-
plish than making a hundred runs.
JEAN IRWIN.
King versus Mammon
Monarchy or Money Power, by R.
McNair Wilson (Eyre and Spottiswoode ;
Robertson and Mullens; 10s. 6d.), is
dedicated to the English monarchy. The
monarch, says Mr. Wilson, used to be
God’s steward. It was the people’s duty
to serve him and it was his duty to inter-
pret God’s will on their behalf. If he
made a wrong diagnosis the people were
in a position to call him to account, and
they sometimes did.
Gradually—chiefly through wal-
kings were driven to moneylenders, and
so delegated their powers—in some cases
to foreign irresponsibles. Napoleon saw
the situation clearly. Money, he decreed,
was not to be exported from France.
Loans were not to be raised fo meet cur-
rent expenditure, civil or military. The
international moneylender realised the
threat to his pre-eminence and mobilised
Europe against Mammon’s enemy. Pitt
was one of the money chiefs’ instruments.
The vast network of wars against Napo-
leon were designed to bring France back
to the pawnshop. So Mr. McNair Wilson
asserts.
Disraeli “saw that a free British market
was an essential part of the scheme of
‘Dutch finance,’ not only as enabling
wages to be kept down, but also as secur-
ing a dumping-ground for goods sent in
payment of the interest on foreign loans
and for goods which the deflated markets
of Germany and France and America
were unable to absorb.” He decided that
the British Empire should express the
“God-thought” and the “King-thought”
and find in the mystical power of the
Throne its focus and meaning. “Money
would then return to its ancient servi-
tude and be suffered no longer to usurp
Crown and Sceptre.” He communicated
his idea to Queen Victoria and was sur-
prised to find that she had a clear under-
standing of the situation.
He was able to strengthen the power
of the Bank of England, but the tide was
setting against him. In the next genera-
tion it submerged Joseph Chamberlain ;
after that it met with no opposition.
To-day, according to Mr. Wilson, the
international money power stands
supreme everywhere. It is indifferent as
to whether countries are ruled by kings,
Soviets, Fascist dictators or democratic
assemblies. A country is only of interest
to it to the extent that it can put a mort-
gage on it.
Mr. Wilson’s solution is a return to
national independence and the God-
system, under an enlightened monarchy.
A nation, he says, is a society, the basis
of which is spiritual and not material.
There is no place in a God-system for
ownership without responsibility. Conse-
quently under it the international finan-
cier would be seen to be superfluous.
Men’s eyes would be made clear again,
the professors of economics would cease
their mumbo-jumbo and Governments
would know, what every infant knows,
that the purpose of production is con-
sumption. The subjects of the King, like
the King himself, would have no right
save that of obedience to the Divine
will, and could possess nothing except
insofar as possession might be necessary
to the performance of duty. “If it is
objected,” he concludes, “that such an
idea partakes of the grotesque in the
modern world, the answer may properly
be made that it is not more, but less,
grotesque than the spectacle now pre-
sented by the Kingdoms of Mammon,
wherein every new exhibition of man’s
power to make use of the resources of
God is attended by fresh calamity and
ruin, and where each addition to the
wealth of humanity adds inevitably to
the number of the destitute.”
M. S.
A Satchel of Books
In New Zealand Holiday (Chapman
and Hall; Bs. 6d.), Rosemary Rees has
written about the most attractive account
of her native land on record. She begins
in Wellington, and proceeds, via Napier,
the Southern Alps, the West Coast and
Auckland, to the Bay of Islands, inter-
spersing her eloquent descriptions with
admirable photographs. The only objec-
tion to this work is that it will arouse
an acute hunger for a sight of the favored
land across the Tasman in the breasts
of thousands who will never be able to
visit it.
Blinky Bill, by Dorothy Wall (Angus
and Robertson ; 4s. 6d.). Another animal-
book for Australian children, with a
koala as the principal character. We
are first introduced to Blinky’s father
and mother and their friends, Mrs. Mag-
pie, Mrs. Snake, Mr. and Mrs. Kangaroo
and others, and we follow him through
his childish adventures and mischiefs to
the time when his mother, Mrs. Koala,
decides to send him to school. The draw-
ings are humorous and the text discloses
a warm affection for Australia’s most
lovable animal.
Amongst its other attractions The
Ghostly Galleon, by Vice-Admiral Evans
(The Bodley Head; 7s. 6d.) has four
full-page illustrations in color by Stanley
Rogers. The story deals with Tudor
times and the chest of one Jeremy Doon,
containing wealth which in the hands of
a mysterious being known as “the Evil”
“would mean such a blow to Christen-
dom that its effects might bring darkness
to the world.” To Dirk Frobisher is
allotted the task of defeating the forces
of evil, and he makes a rousing success
of it. A thrilling adventure yarn with
enough fighting and bloodshed to satisfy
any healthy gory-minded boy.
For Those That Love It, by Myrtle R.
White (Angus and Robertson; 6s.). A
vivid and moving yarn of station life in
the country west of the Darling. Life
in a region where the nearest town is 200
miles away; where sugar has to be
ordered by the half-ton, and flour by the
ton ; where drought is the rule, and the
men’s drinking-water is often flavored by
long-dead sheep. Such is Tarrawatta,
where Helen, the heroine —and she is a
genuine one —lives with her brother Jim.
She has a bad time, but things look up as
the rain comes and she turns to the
man she loves.
The Australian and New Zealand Press
Directory, 1933 (Country Press Co-
operative Co. Ltd., Sydney ; 2s.' 6d.), gives
particulars of Australasia’s thousand and
odd periodicals, from the humblest
suburban rag to the proudest metropoli-
tan dailies. It also supplies information
regarding the districts in which the papers
are published.
J. Storer Clouston is always funny,
but he isn’t at his best in The Virtuous
Vamp (Blackwood; 3s. 6d.). Ursula’s
novel is amusing enough, but the un-
conscious humor of the child-writer was
pretty well exhausted by “The Little
Visiters.” The Scottish servitors are
shrewdly drawn, and there is a pleasant
little romance in which the designs of
a despicable young modernist on the
pretty wife of nice Sir Hector are set
at naught by Ursula.
Long Odds, by Cecil Dent (Philip
Allan; 7s. 6d.), is an old-style racing
romance with modern embellishments.
Lionel, Joan’s degenerate twin, not only
gambles away her mare Rebel Maid, but
loses her to the villain, Vipont, as well.
The man she loves is Dick Blakeney, one
of the best cross-country amateurs in
England. He rides Rebel Maid in the
National, and the broadcast description
of the great Aintree event fairly sizzles
with excitement. As Rebel Maid starts
at 40’s (largely owing to the machina-
tions of Vipont) the heroine is able to
win enough to recover the family pro-
perty, marry the Maid’s accomplished
jockey and hunt in comfort for the rest
of her life.
Paying the Piper, by Ruth Brocking-
ton (Chapman and Hall; 7s. 6d.). The
narrator of this story is one of the resi-
dents of an English country town. She
is what a committee-woman of, say, the
Queen’s Club would call “really nice.”
So are all her friends, with the exception
of one dastardly plutocrat who, when her
husband’s business goes wrong, makes
an infamous suggestion to her. The prin-
cipal character is Miss Mullins, a
strangely sexless and proportionately
“nice” governess who refuses a wealthy
major, and who wouldn’t have married
at all if her eventual captor hadn’t been
cunning enough to prove that it was her
duty to sacrifice herself. It isn’t like life,
but it provides an agreeable antidote to
the novels about blaspheming, cocktail-
shaking B.Y.Ts., which aren’t like life,
either.

SAVING THE WHEAT
INDUSTRY.
The wheat position in the four main-
land States which grow the vegetable for
export has been unsatisfactory for years,
but no Government has made the slight-
est genuine attempt to find a remedy,
though all Governments have done a
power of meddling. The average area
under crop has more than doubled in
20 years—for the last decade the mean
was about 11,300,000 acres. Aver-
age yield per acre, despite Farrer and
fertiliser, is less than it was in the
‘seventies. Of the 39 principal wheat-
growing countries only three or four
have a smaller per-acre offput than Aus-
tralia, and 16 harvest double the Aus-
tralian p.a. yield. Leaving out small
countries like Holland and Belgium, Ger-
many averages 30.7 bushels, France and
Hungary well over 20 bushels. Canada’s
yield is 18.28 bushels; Australia’s was
9.62 bushels over the years 1927-29, 11.76
in 1930 and 11.65 in 1931.
There is nothing wrong with the
quality of our wheats, though they are
often badly graded and made into car-
goes unintelligently. But because pro-
duction costs are high and yield is
low, the industry was heading for trouble
long before the depression arrived, and
it has become the plaything of politics.
Every election platform knows the dema-
gogue who is going to “guarantee the
grower 7s. 6d. a bushel.” Every pro-
ducers’ meeting hears the call for
“orderly marketing” and a fixed price, or,
failing both, a bonus. Rarely does any-
body think of wheat except in the terms
of the moment. Towards harvest-time,
the Commonwealth Government, looking
white about the gills, gives a hurried
glance at the situation and then runs
away, strewing a little cash along the
track to delay pursuit.
The position of the growers is bad
everywhere except in Queensland —
which raises about enough wheat for
its own consumption and is per-
mitted to block imports from other
States, in spite of the Constitution —
but it is worst in South Australia. There
the Government spoon-feeds so-called
growers who have scarcely produced any-
thing for several years except an addi-
tion to the mortgage. In a case quoted
by the Auditor-General, a settler whose
net proceeds during six years had been £5O,
and whose best harvest went 2\ bushels
to the acre, succeeded in owing the
Government £3028. The average crop
value of Australian wheat land is about
£1 10s. per acre p.a. This man
has accumulated relief liabilities alone
of £4 3s. 6d. an acre. His total output of
2000 bushels in six years has cost more
than £2 a bushel to raise.
Only 4.4 per cent, of S.A. wheat-
growers applying for relief were able
to pay all creditors in 1931. Last
year the figure was 1.5 per cent. And
last year only 9.2 per cent, of more
than 3000 relief beneficiaries were able
to meet interest, rent and dividend on
antecedent debts. In aiding the industry
the most embarrassed State Government
in Australia has found as much as
£1,000,000 in a single year, most of which
will never be paid back.
N. S. Wales has a flour tax, the pro-
ceeds of which are reserved for farmers
in actual distress. The Commonwealth
a year ago weighed in with £2,000,000
(N.S.W.’s share was about one-fourth)
as a last-minute donation. It has re-
mained for 1933-34 to show us the situa-
tion carried to its natural conclusion of
muddle and weakness.
The international agreement, of which
details were announced in Parliament on
October 6, was designed to relieve our
export wheat, in common with that of
other countries with a surplus, of Euro-
pean tariff restriction, and to raise the
international price to 4s. per bushel. Pro-
fessor Copland said immediately after
the conference that nobody except the
gentlemen who signed the agreement
“was sanguine of its success,” because
to reach the objective
a rise of about 25 per cent, in the inter-
national price would be necessary. Unless there
is a serious disaster to the European wheat
crop in the near future this price seems far
distant.
After the sale of the October-delivered
Troja and City of Winchester shipments
it was obvious how true these words
Were. There would be no 4s. a bushel
for the growers; the price would be
nearer 3s. at ports.
In 1931, after the fiasco of the Grow
More Wheat campaign, Professor Per-
kins, of South Aus., proposed a sales tax
on flour, the proceeds to be distributed
among the sold growers ; and no better
expedient has been suggested. At £5 a
ton such a tax would yield this season
about £3,000,000. But the master-bakers
don’t like the notion, and the temporary
U.A.P. members who got in on the crest
of a wave of dislike for Scullin and Lang
tremble at the thought of anything which
might jeopardise votes. Moreover,
Queensland and Tasmania are hostile,
though Forgan Smith, who wants a
couple of millions for important projects
like a new bridge, doesn’t object to a
loan. So a loan it is to be ; £2,500,000
is to be raised by Treasury bills to
finance a bounty of 3|d. a bushel. It
will be some relief, of course, though the
relief will not be adequate, and the
method of raising the money is wrong,
In the matter of the salary grab, the
Government showed that it could make
up its mind in an hour or so and act
before the day was old. How different
its attitude to the sales tax on flour! First
it said it would ; then it said it mightn’t;
then it consulted the party; then it
arranged to confer with the Cockies;
then, without meeting those doubtful
allies, the Prime Minister rushed off to
Melbourne to implore Robert Gibson
for a loan. These vast intellectual labors
concluded, he crossed over to Tasmania
—leaving Latham, without whom the
Government is but a wandering voice, to
see the Cockies —to recruit his exhausted
powers.
The future outlook is, of course, more
serious than the present. If a bounty
of £2,500,000 is required when we are
apparently within our export quota in
a year of poor yields, what will be re-
quired if acreage continues to expand
without per-acre-yield improvement? If
disaster is to be averted there will have
to be a concerted plan, with Govern-
ments, banks, fertiliser companies, mer-
chants and growers as parties, to make
the industry profitable by improving the
acreage yield, by cutting costs, by writ-
ing down —by negotiation—the price of
iand for which a ss.- or 65.-a-bushel
price was paid, and by ceasing to molly-
coddle hopeless cases. Local consump-
tion of wheat products might be im-
proved as well; in this respect sound
animal-export industries, such as the
bacon business, could help.
If 10 per cent, more wheat were used
in Australia, and if the average value of
the crop per acre could be brought from
the S.A. standard of £1 per acre and the
Commonwealth average of £1 10s. per
acre to something near the Queensland
figure of £3 15s. per acre overall,
without employing the Queensland de-
vices of a closed market and a fixed price,
low per-bushel prices would matter con-
siderably less than they do now. Mr.
Stewart, the Minister of Commerce, who
knows all there is to know about ’buses,
could then go back to his ’buses and
leave the wheat men to fend for them-
selves.
THE NEW ALL-HIGHEST.
Germany continues to be the answer to
the political agent’s prayer; but nowa-
days political agents have all to be on
the one side. Previous general elections
—they are held every few months —
were contested by Socialists, National
Socialists (Nazis), Communists, Catholics
(or Centrists), the National People’s
party, the German People’s party,
the Agricultural party, the Middle-
class party, the German State party, the
Bavarian People’s party and various
minor parties. At last week’s appeal to
the people, as it was called, there were
only Nazis.
Nazis dissolved the Reichstag, sup-
plied all the candidates, whipped up the
votes, counted them and declared them-
selves elected. In the result there will
be 677 members sworn to follow Hitler
wherever he may lead them —“all
Aryans,” it is explained, and all men.
For, although women have the vote and
have had representatives of their own
sex in the Reichstag, it has been decreed
by Hitler that their political star has set.
They were permitted to vote for the new
All-Highest, but after they voted they
were bidden to go home and prepare the
old man’s dinner and mind the children.
Forty-three million votes were cast at
the election proper, or improper, and
about half a million more at a referen-
dum at which the people were asked,
or ordered, to approve of Germany’s
withdrawal from the Disarmament Con-
ference and the League of Nations. Up-
wards of 92 p.c. were for the party that
had no opponents, and 93.4 p.c. said
“Ja-Ja" at the referendum. One election
ballot-paper in every 14 was informal.
Some were invalidated by illiterates;
others by enthusiasts who adorned them
with swastikas; but most, no doubt,
by bold spirits who took the risk of being
sent to the concentration camps which
have been thoughtfully provided for non-
believers in the gospel according to
Hitler.
At the election of September, 1930,
when the Reichstag consisted of 577
seats, the Nazis won 107. Allowing for
the terror inspired by the persecution of
the Jews and the obliteration of the
Socialist and Communist parties, and for
the docility of a people accustomed
through the centuries to rule by the strong
hand, mailed or otherwise, they must be
conceded to have made a tremendous
advance. Germany is still nominally a
Federal Republic, but President, Reichs-
tag and Reichsrat (if there is still a
Reichsrat) have become mere ciphers.
Goering, Hitler’s lieutenant, devoted part
of his last pre-election speech to an attack
on the Parliamentary system, which he
characterised as being “rooted in coward-
ice, like pacifism.” He went on to assail
the political power of the Catholic
Church, against which even Bismarck
warred in vain ; the Nazis, he said, would
let “neither red rats nor black moles
return.” As if this were not enough for
one night, the gentleman added that the
people “should be proud that the Lord
once created the German army, the fear
of which still makes foreign countries
shudder.”
No doubt dictators newly won to
power over warlike peoples have to rattle
the sabre by way of consolidating their
position. Mussolini did it in the early
days of Fascism ; and he has mellowed
into a good European and citizen of the
world. But there is a truculent note in
the speeches of the Nazi leaders that was
absent from the young Mussolini’s ; and,
as this generation has learned in blood
and tears, Germany can be a far greater
menace to the peace of the world than
Italy could ever be.
In a bitter comment on the position
of women under the Nazi dispensation,
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence remarked at a
meeting in London, with only too much
truth:
Married and unmarried, they have been dis-
missed from their posts. They have been told
that their true function is to exhaust themselves
bearing children.
In their attitude to women, and to war
perhaps, the new rulers of Germany
have gone right back to Nietzsche:
All in woman is a riddle, and all in woman
hath one answer—that is, child-bearing.
Two things true man desireth: danger and
play. Therefore he desireth woman as the
most dangerous of playthings.
Man shall be trained for war, and woman
for the recreation of the warrior: all else is
folly.
Woman must obey and find depth to her
surface. Surface is woman’s nature, foam tossed
to and fro in shallow water.
Man’s happiness is, I will. Woman’s happi-
ness is, He will.
Thou goest "to women? Remember thy
whip.
It might almost be Goering speaking.
Ramsay MacDonald is imploring the
Nazis to return to his pathetic Disarma-
ment Conference, and the Conservatives
are building 9000-ton cruisers, and the
French are saying that their old enemy
has three million men trained for war
and secret stores of armaments, not in
Germany alone, but in Holland and
Sweden. But the danger lies not so much
in his actual military preparations as in
his state of mind.
THE BUCHANANS.
Gordon Buchanan has written a book
which marks the end of an epoch. It is
about his father, Nat Buchanan, drover
and explorer, and Nat Buchanan’s asso-
ciates, of whom most people to-day have
never heard. I hope a trans-Styx edition
is to be printed, for if it is it will sell
well under the golden gum-trees, and
many a dog-eared copy smelling strongly
of saddle-bag and goanna fat will be
produced by celestial campfires to settle
bets about the old days when the Duracks
and Gordons and little Tommy Cahill—
ask for Kay-hill or the doorkeeper won’t
know whom you mean—get together to
settle history.
Buchanan, son of a British army
officer, took his bride, in the early ’sixties,
to the station 300 miles behind Port
Denison (N.Q-) which he had . named
Bowen Downs. One of his men, galled
by the strenuous travelling pace which
young Nathaniel set, cried out “Madam,
your husband is a madman! ” The lady,
just twenty-one, replied: “Then God give
this country more madmen like him!"
Poor woman, she saw little of her
“madman”! Though he tried to settle
down he wasn’t born that way. It is
true that in the early ’seventies he so far
conceded her right to comfort to move
into what he considered the suburbs of
Sydney about Kempsey, where he was
shut out from markets only for seasons
instead of for years at a time, and where
“sugar and tea were always luxuries” and
flour had to be replaced by ground maize
for months on end. He, also, once made
a home for her for a few years at Flora
Vale, which was only a thousand miles
or so from a real town. But normally
he was to be found sitting on a horse
somewhere in the Territory, though he
had a habit of coming home if he hap-
pened to be passing and it meant deviat-
ing only six or seven hundred miles.
On one occasion, after a very long period
without news of any kind, we received a cheque
for £7OO.
But Nat Buchanan cared little for
money, and he was too busy to think of
it. He explored the North from Aramac
to Burketown; from Burketown on to
Glencoe, just south of Darwin. He
pioneered the Barkly Tableland. He
pushed out to Wave Hill and down on
to the Ord and the Fitzroy and the Mur-
chison. Afterwards he took cattle in
huge mobs over the tracks which he had
blazed, and left behind him many a creek
and lake tagged with his name.
Wave Hill, now the greatest outback
station in Australia, was his foundation,
and so was Ord station ; but he had little
profit from them. Ninety-three saw to
that. Anyway his name will always live
by his droving feats. What bull-hustler
even to-day, with all the local facilities
of maps and cut lines and charted water-
holes, would care to drive 20,000 head,
regimented into four mobs, nearly all
from the N.S.W. border to a few miles
south of Darwin? Buchanan did it in 1881
with a camp of 70 men, carrying his own
food and materials, and thanking Heaven
that the way was mostly sandy going
down the Gulf, so that he did not need
a drayload of horseshoes. He did it with
Farquharson and Tommy Cahill and Jack
Warby, all fresh and wrestling to be first
in at Glencoe with their sections at the
end of the 1800-mile trek.
It was perilous work ; the N.T., like
the Kentucky of Daniel Boone, was
“dark and bloody ground.” Once, on
the Limmen, one of Buchanan’s men knelt
in the camp making a damper.
There was a flash in the cruel midday glare
—and the severed head of Travers fell into
his dish The bloodstained axe beside his
body had been stolen from the camp.
Nat Buchanan was the greatest drover
of all time, and his menage was the most
picturesque that Australia has known
since the days of Hawdon and the open-
ing of the Port Phillip overland in the
’thirties. Apart from the Gordons and
the Cahills, there were men of legend
about him like that lovable Mtinchhausen
Carr-Boyd, like Greenhide Sam Croker
and Ramrod Smith, Savannah Smith and
Charlie Macdonald, who, in moleskins
and cabbage-tree, danced with the Gov-
ernor’s lady on the ship from Fremantle
to Adelaide and was asked for a lock of
his beard by a leading actor, who said it
“was the first product he had seen grow-
ing in Australia.”
The earlier part of Buchanan’s history
is epic, but there was nothing more gallant
in his record than his last expedition.
Over 60, broken by a bad fall from a
horse, he set out with camels, which he
didn’t like and didn’t understand, from
the Tennant to attempt to find a trail
to Sturt Creek. His only companion was
a myall black more than 6ft. high. Two
days out this boy refused to go further,
so Buchanan sneaked on him at night
and handcuffed him to his camel saddle.
Together, they completed the terrible
journey.
Nat Buchanan died in 1901 on a farm
on the New England. His gallant little
wife survived in a cottage in the Sydney
suburb of Chatswood till 1924. Many
of the old drovers still live, a menace to
the theory that hard work and northern
climates kill early. They are the symbols
of the swiftness of Australian change.
Their early adventures started the civilis-
ing movements which have swept them
out of business. The progress which
has taken place since their day is poison
to the pessimism of those who see no
future for Australian manhood.
Nat Buchanan, like some other
pioneers, needed a literary monument.
The simple, straightforward story which
his son (who shared many of his ad-
ventures) has written will provide it. It
will bring his tall, dark figure to the
minds of thousands of old hands far
better than any piece of stone.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Subscribed in Two Days.
The Commonwealth Treasury is jubilant
at the success of its £10,000,000 loan. The
experience of the London conversion in
September, when nearly £100,000,000 was
offered on a £20,000,000 Commonwealth
issue, was not repeated on a smaller
scale only because the loan was closed
so soon as the amount agreed to by the
Commonwealth Bank had been raised, as
it was in two days.
The yield of £3 12s. sd. p.c. to in-
vestors, first interest to be paid on Feb-
ruary 15, looks a better bargain than it
really is for the Treasury, since interest
is exempt from State income tax and
Commonwealth super-tax on property
income. And while it is heartening that
public confidence in the Commonwealth
is so strong as to achieve such a prompt
result, the success has another side which
cannot be ignored. The investment is as
much dictated by the unwillingness of
people to put their money into industry
as by the intrinsic merits of the loan.
There is nothing in banking figures to
prove that as much new money is going
into private enterprise as politicians
would like us to believe. In Victoria,
certainly, figures for the June-September
quarter showed a shrinkage of £4,212,000,
but two-thirds of this was accounted for
by the return to N. S. Wales of money
transferred to Melbourne during the
Lang regime. This expanded N.S.W.
deposits rather than increased accom-
modation to industry. South Australia,
too, showed an increase in deposits, but
in four States the net decrease in de-
posits was only £437,000 for the quarter
as compared with the corresponding
quarter of last year. Private bank ad-
vances and securities for the four States
were greater in this year’s third quarter
by £6,800,000 —the figure for six States
was about £8,000,000 —than in last year’s
corresponding period, but the effects of
support given by private investors to
public finance are included in the figures.
This much is clear. If Governments
gave up borrowing for “works,” which
produce nothing but deficiencies, and
borrowed instead for tax-reduction, mak-
ing it as far as possible conditional on
the giving of work, they could get the
money.

After Trautwem.
The second ballot for the “reformed”
N.S.W. Leg. Council has pleased party
managers more than the first one did, and
“S. M. Herald” is delighted. Mr. Traut-
wein and Mr. Alam and Mr. Murray hav-
ing been provided for —Mr. Murray, who,
as the “Herald” puts it, has been con-
nected with “various parties,” and is “at
the present time an active supporter of
the U.A.P.” —member-electors deigned
to consider others of less note, such as
Mr. T. A. J. Playfair, Dr. Colvin, Dr.
Wall and knight Norman Kater. All
four saw war service; Mr. Playfair
won the D.S.O. and was mentioned in
despatches five times. He is president of
the U.A.P. also ; nevertheless, in the first
ballot he could get only three primary
votes out of 194. Norman Kater, for his
part, though a leader of the pastoralists,
achieved one first-run supporter against
the Alam-Balaam opposition.
Still, astonishing things happened in
this second ballot. James Ryan, the Hon-
orary Minister, could not find a place
among the 15 elected, nor could B. B.
O’Conor, the Chairman of Committees.
H. S. Nicholas, an able Constitutional
authority, received two primary votes
and Mr. L. W. Ryan six, and if two intel-
lectual giants had not mulled their ballot-
papers (ten did it again) he would have
got eight. Who Mr. L. W. Ryan is no-
body outside his immediate friends and
business associates seems to know. Yet
he was among the chosen, and so was
Mr. J. F. O’Regan, who is almost as
obscure.
“S. M. Herald” protests that “men of
ripe experience” will serve in the
“reformed” Chamber, for which it pre-
dicts a long and useful career. “Ripe”
is a somewhat unfortunate adjective ; it
smacks too much of fruit machines. Be
this as it may, the “Herald’s” enthusiasm
is not widely shared. The impression
deepens that the election of members
by members failed at the first trial of the
principle, and that this child of the
U.A.P. was born with the death-dew on
its brow.
Not Squealers, But
Australians are not squealers, but the
clumsy tactics of persons on the admin-
istrative side of sport have made it
appear that they are. This impression
was mortifyingly conveyed by the boor-
ish cablegram sent by the Board of
Cricket Control to the Marylebone C.C.
after the Test match at Adelaide. And
now, when everyone but a few sore-
heads is sick of the “bodyline” barney,
the board has revived it by dispatching
another stupid message in which it
“assumes” that the English authorities
have condemned the form of bowling it
objects to and repudiated Jardine and
Larwood, and adds: “It is on this under-
standing that we are sending a team in
1934.” In private life it is not the prac-
tice to lay down conditions on which
you will accept hospitality.
In the North of England a month ago
there were all the elements of another
bodyline controversy, even to the pres-
ence on the spot of the newspaperman
who started the hue and cry against
Jardine —because that dour person had
refused to pick his team for the Perth
match in time for the journalist to get
the news in that day’s issue of his paper.
Following the idiotic precedent of
the Board of Control, the managers
of the touring team of Rugby League
footballers unburdened their souls of
complaints, not when their men were
winning—and they won 11 matches on
end —but when they were losing. After
three defeats and a disappointing show-
ing against a weak team, they wrote to
the secretary of the Rugby League com-
plaining of “unpleasant experiences,”
objecting to a particular referee and
touch judge, and asking that “your com-
mittee refrain from appointing either of
these officials to any future game in
which the Australians take part.”
To make matters worse, they handed the
letter to the newspapers before it could
be considered by the Rugby League.
Whatever warrant there may have been
for their charges against the officials
named and for their insinuations about
English playing methods, in that they
were utterly in the wrong.
One of the Manchester newspapers
hotly resented what it called the attack
on the English team, describing it as
“provocative and insulting,” and Aus-
tralians as “splendid winners but very
bad losers” ; but the Rugby League be-
haved handsomely, and so did the crowds.
The League contented itself with a mild
protest against premature publication of
the letter; for the rest, it called the Aus-
tralian managers into consultation, in-
vited them to give ocular demonstration
of their case against English interpreta-
tions of certain League rules, and an-
nounced subsequent to the meeting that
the objections to the two officials named
had been “noted.” After this they gave
the tourists everything their managers
asked for, allowing them to pick the
referee for the second representative
match and play with an Australian-made
ball.
And even the newspaperman afore-
said admits that the attitude of the spec-
tators was unexceptionable. At one place
they rose and cheered the Australians
after a match in which the tourists went
down gallantly; at another “the sym-
pathy showered on fhe team became
almost embarrassing” ; and a Manchester
“Sunday Chronicle” report that “the
demonstration which greeted the Aus-
tralians when they scored” was “equal in
every way to that which the triumphant
English try evoked” is quoted with
approval.
There is so much that is sordid in gate-
money sport that it is pleasant to chron-
icle a case in which tact and good feeling
have been shown by a professional
organisation in a situation that might
have led to another miserable wrangle,
and real sportsmanship by English work-
ing-class crowds. Evidently Jess Oak-
royds are by no means uncommon in the
North of England.

Alfred Felton’s Money.
“F.S.” submits that a lot of it has been
ill spent:
A recent art event in Melbourne was the un-
veiling of paintings which cost £60,000 by J. A.
Levey, chairman of the Felton Bequest, at the
National Gallery. Of the Rembrandt self-
portrait it may be said that it is a definite
acquisition to the gallery. Though not a first-
class example of the last period of the great
Flemish master, it still towers head and
shoulders over nine-tenths of the pictures in the
national collection. But the same cannot be
said of the huge “Banquet of Cleopatra,” by
Tiepolo (1692-1769), for which the trustees paid
over £30,000.
Tiepolo, an inferior Paolo Veronese, was a
court painter at Madrid. He painted people with
abnormally small heads, and the £30,000 pic-
ture once hung in a palace of the Czars. It is
little more than a colored cartoon, as good or
bad as a score of others for which very much
smaller prices have been paid. There used to
be something similar, depicting Moses descend-
ing with the Tables of the Law, by an artist
whose name has slipped the mind. It disap-
peared from the walls of the gallery some
years ago and has never been heard of since.
Presumably it is in the cellar, where the Tiepolo
will probably follow it within ten years.
Dr. Sugden, chairman of the National Gallery
trustees, gave as a reason for the rejection of
certain modern pictures that, although the paint-
ing was good, the prices were “extreme.” The
layman might ask, if £30,000 is considered a
fair figure for a rubbishy Tiepolo, whose author
has been cold 200 years, why a few hundreds,
or a few thousands, even, might not be a fair
price for the work of a man who is still alive
and kicking, and could put the money to good
use. The doctor quoted the appeal to a Wild-
West audience: “The pianist is doing his best —
don’t shoot!” The analogy is false. The
trustees aren’t pianists playing the appropriate
instrument; that is, they aren’t painters,
although they buy pictures. They are lawyers,
doctors of theology, politicians and professors
of various things, the artists forming a tiny
minority. Since 1904 over £440,000 of Felton’s
money has been expended by this body on
works of art, and the result is pretty correctly
summed up in a recent book by a visiting Eng-
lishman.
“The galleries in Australia seem to consist
largely of second-rate English pictures of the
gay ’nineties, when art in England was most
depressing.”
The position will not improve until the
trustees set up a board composed of, say, six
leading Victorian painters, capable of judging
a picture on considerations other than its
antiquity or signature.

Sam Recognises Ivan.
Litvinoff’s mission to the U.S.A., which
has resulted in the “recognition” of the
Red Republic by the country whose
money and factories it stole, was in sub-
stance a counter-attack on Japan. Nip-
pon’s manoeuvres in Manchuria cowed
the Reds for a time. They even talked of
giving up their Maritime Province, with
Vladivostok, its outlet on the Pacific. The
Chinese Eastern Railway, which inter-
national engineers built with French
money for the Czars, is now in the hands
of the Emperor-President of Manchukuo,
who is prepared to buy the Soviet out
for £4,000,000. The Soviet’s price is
£40,000,000, or thereabouts.
Washington is not keen on the Bol-
shies, but it likes the Japanese less. Its
change of front towards Moscow is also
connected with its need for exporting
machinery to keep its factories on the
move and its anxiety to find markets for
its surplus cotton and wheat.
With the prospect of gaining U.S.A.
recognition and credits, Moscow plucked
up courage. The other day it buried a
Japanese Communist with great cere-
mony and hectoring remarks about
Japanese imperialism, and the correspon-
dents report movements of troop trains
and battleplanes on both sides. The
situation is difficult, and may lead to
another Russo-Japanese war; but not
until the northern winter is over. Both
parties have a wholesale respect for
Generals Janvier and Fevrier.

Whose Gold?
Maoriland is by schisms rent asunder
over a proposal in its Reserve Bank Bill,
which has passed the Lower House, that
the Government shall take over all the
gold coin in the hands of the private
banks—about 4,400,000 sovereigns—at
mint par value: £4 ss. per fine ounce.
Francis Bell, K.C., an ex-Premier, has
given an opinion that the proposal is
legally unsound, as the gold is the banks’
property, and should be paid for at its
current value. Finance Minister Coates,
for the Government, takes the line that
the gold is held purely as a statutory
reserve against note issue, and that the
banks retain it only because the Govern-
ment years ago absolved them from the
liability of redeeming their notes in gold.
The banks retort that their statutory gold
reserve against note issue is 33 1-3 per
cent., whereas their gold holdings are
little short of 100 per cent, of notes
issued, and in the case of four of the six
banks actually exceed note issue. More
outspoken critics say that the Govern-
ment aims at staving off the return to
roost of the chickens of boosted ex-
change.
The Reserve Bank’s note issue need
have a backing of only 25 per cent.
sterling exchange, and if it commandeers
the private banks’ gold at mint par and
exercises to the full its right to take up
outstanding Treasury bills, over
£20,000,000 will be made available to
the Treasury to tide over present finan-
cial troubles.

The Victorian Way.
In Victoria they have no garish “art-
unions” for hospitals and the like, and
no Whiddons are requisitioned for pub-
licity purposes. There is a Charities Board,
which authorises all public appeals and
controls allocations of Government
money. But although £297,576 was
at its disposal last year, the board finds it
hard to provide for its responsibilities.
Not a leading hospital in Melbourne,
Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong but shows
a cumulative deficiency on the past five
years’ maintenance account, and the
results of public appeals, of which half
a dozen or so have been authorised dur-
ing the year, have been “in the main un-
satisfactory.”
Hence the need to provide for ordinary
maintenance revenue in a more scientific and
regular way.
It has been suggested that Victoria
should copy the feverish lottery gambles
of other States ; but the board will have
none of them. It recommends a sort of
sickness superannuation scheme, em-
bracing hospital and home-nursing bene-
fits for subscribers; the development of
sectionalised hospital accommodation
according to power of inmates to pay ;
the removal of a quota of regular wage-
and salary-earners from public wards;
the establishment of district responsi-
bility for dealing with the local indigent,
at least in part; and, lastly,
Creation of confidence among charitably-
minded people that... .their donations are used
solely for the purpose for which they are sub-
scribed, i.e., treatment of the sick.
Confidence is a most essential matter. It
is regrettably lacking in Sydney, where
there are organisations which can only
salvage one pound in every four they col-
lect for use on their specific objectives.
Of course, there are others, like the un-
obtrusive Smith Family, whose hearts are
bigger than their expenses. The Smiths’
collection charges, administrative in-
cluded, are only 10 p.c. of total gifts ;
and they get even the threepences of the
unemployed without asking for them.
On, Stanley, On!
It is confidently predicted in political
circles that one of the results of the Vic-
torian centenary celebrations will be the
ennobling of Stanley Melbourne Bruce.
The Beasley group will say “We told
you so! ” Pearce’s ambition will be
whetted by having to address as “M’
Lord” his old leader, who will have been
exalted to take precedence just below
the Royal family, a few dozen arch-
bishops and bishops, and a couple of
thousand members of the senior peerage
and their sons. Just above him in the
realms of glory will be a number of
fledgling nobles, who include an art
dealer, some comparatively minor doc-
tors, a few retired ambassadors and an
awkward general or two who have come
to the shelving age.
The cartoonists will score, of course.
Who would trouble to draw that noble
form bounded fore and aft by a top-hat
and spats when it may be more accu-
rately limned under a coronet, enveloped
in a scarlet mantle barred with ermine
and tapering in the lower regions into a
neat ensemble of satin panties and un-
exceptionable calves?
But the thing has its serious side. Per-
haps Australia should have a High Com-
missioner in the Lords. It is a splendid
rostrum from which a speaker of Bruce’s
ability may command Empire-wide atten-
tion. Northern Ireland has thirteen
representatives in the Commons. They
keep Belfast well in the public eye.
Moreover, there is something inspiring
to youth in the thought that the son of
a poor Scottish immigrant who began
his career in Australia as a caretaker
and rose to be one of the greatest mer-
chants in the Southern Hemisphere
should be able to reach the reddest
benches of Westminster as the reward of
his own energy and ability.
Bruce has probably never spent a
penny on his political advancement other-
wise than on election expenses and on
travelling costs incurred while Prime
Minister, which, for other Prime Minis-
ters, the taxpayers have always paid. His
public life has been a guiding light to
every youngster in Australia with money
to make him independent.
Already his example has led a number
of solid young men, such as White, Casey
and Fairbairn, into the Federal House.
He has never been a self-seeker, and if
he wants to be a peer and walk in ermine
nobody should grudge him so small a
distinction.

“Speaking as a Lunger.”
“Alma L.”: “El V.’s” condemnaton of
physical fitness (B. 1/11 /’33) has much
in its favor. Since so many of the
world’s great ones were* diseased, disease
must be good in itself; so let us have
more of it, and no more sanatoria, V.D.
clinics, cancer research, schools of pre-
ventive medicine or hospitals. Such
economies would help the world to
struggle out of its financial difficulties.
Speaking as a lunger I must admit
that it is rather galling to have to suffer
the inconveniences of the complaint with
none of the compensating greatness.
However, if I infect my children, maybe
one of them will produce a masterpiece
of letters which will keep the wolf from
the door. The least I can do is to see
that they get a minimum of physical
culture. This is not difficult for the fol-
lowing reasons: —
(1) On 14s. a day with a large family there
is no money left over for sports equipment or
club subs.
(2) In Boulder (W.A.), where I live, there is
no free water to swim in.
(3) I have no strength left in me to drill
them without equipment.
Unfortunately there is a catch. When
they are big enough and old enough
they will take a shovel underground and
do a little gentle bogging and trucking.
Such physical exercise will tend to make
them fine physical specimens. But —and
it is a large but—-they will have an
equal chance with their fellows of get-
ting dusted. Then our aim will have
been accomplished and greatness will
follow.

“ND IT'S INTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS”
u Verri”: Our small nephew, overcome
by the evidences of loyalty on Empire
Day, demanded a flag. The only avail-
able material happened to have a repre-
sentation of cards on a cerise ground,
and the youngster contentedly marched
all Saturday afternoon round the garden
with his gaudy banner. We missed him
on Sunday morning, and during an agi-
tated search heard the Salvation Army

“What argument?”
“Suppose a man lost the wife’s address.”
band in the distance. Of course he was
with it. When we arrived he was march-
ing about six yards ahead of the Army’s
scarlet banner, proudly waving his card-
strewn calico, while a perturbed bands-
man with a trombone under one arm
was pantingly trying to overtake him,
We removed the lad and the cards, but

pression that the Salvoes had taken to
advocating a game of whist or poker for
the cure of souls.

“The Antiqqary”: An Edward Bel-
lamy may have kept a pie-and-coffee
stall just outside the precincts of the M.L.
Parliament (B. 8/11/’33), but it is much
more probable that the name is an im-
ported one, like “Hansard” and “Tatter-
sail’s.” In Old Palace Yard, Westminster,
adjoining the old House of Commons,
was a famous coffee- and chop-house
known as Bellamy’s Tavern, which had a
high repute among eighteenth-century
legislators. When it was decided that
members should have their own restau-
rant on the premises, John Bellamy, pro-
prietor of the chop-house, got the con-
tract. He was an intimate of Fox, Sheri-
dan and the younger Pitt, and he estab-
lished the kitchen department of the
House of Commons.

“R. Volt”: The 19th anniversary of
the Emden-Sydney scrap, just passed, re-
calls that a lot of chance was required
for the battle to occur at all. The Aus-
tralian convoy, unseen, was only 40 miles
off Cocos when the Emden sighted the
atoll, but if Von Muller had not tried to
do his job of cutting the cables too
thoroughly he might have got away.
There was a number of cables entering
the water, but only three of them went
out to sea, the rest being merely kept
in position for use in case of repairs.
The German landing party cut one
actual line of communication, wasting
its time sawing through the dummies
until the Sydney’s smoke was seen and
the Emden sounded the recall. “If I had
got up to you,” Von Muller said later
when a prisoner on an Australian troop-
ship, “I should have run alongside her,”
pointing to the cruiser on the port bow of
the convoy—“and fired a torpedo. Then,
in the confusion, I should have got in
amongst the transports. I should have
sunk half of them, I think, before your
escort came up and sank me.” It is at
least certain that he would have tried.

“Avon”: The Maoriland Supreme
Court got a shock the other day when,
on a habeas corpus application, the
methods of the Dominion’s Children’s
Court came under review. The 16-year-
old daughter of a Scottish couple recently
arrived in the Dominion got a bit out
of hand —attended dances, which her
mother, a strict Presbyterian, strongly
disapproved of. Mother spoke to a
Salvarmy major (a lady) about it, and
the upshot was that the girl was arrested
on a charge of vagrancy, remanded for
a fortnight and consigned to a Salvarmy
home meantime. The remand for that
period was in itself illegal, and the charge
of vagrancy unsustainable, seeing that
the girl had private means and her
parents were well-to-do. The girl left the
Salvarmy institution and returned home,
to be reconciled to her mother ; then in
her absence, and without any notifica-
tion or summons to court, she was con-
victed and discharged on the charge of
vagrancy, and, on a further charge of
being a delinquent, sentenced to three
years in a Borstal reformatory. She
served 18 months before being released
on probation. Shortly after her release
she was seen out late at night, was again
“Now she’s lost so much money, how’s she going to keep the wolf from the
door?”
“By singing.”
“How very drastic !”
summarily arrested, and thrown into a
common gaol. The Supreme Court
found that the Children’s Court had no
power to commit to a Borstal institution,
and, with the brief comment that this
was only one of various irregularities,
granted the writ.

“Old Lag”: Fortunate is the burglar
who can plant his loot where searching
police cannot locate it; some juvenile
delinquents in Brisbane found a way of
solving the problem. The police were
puzzled by continual raids on butchers’
shops and small stores, the stuff taken
being invariably edible. Finally they
pounced on a party of three boys and two
girls, ranging from 11 to 17 years, and
these made a clean breast of it. As soon as
they secured their booty the criminals
made a habit of retiring to the nearest
convenient spot and devouring it. One
butcher was robbed four times, his entire
stock of saveloys vanishing on each occa-
sion. It says something for the Queens-
land pure foods law that none of the
gang ever needed medical attention.

“Centurion”: Sydney City Council is
alarmed to find that its revenue from
the collection of trade refuse has been
cut into, and is talking of reserving all
rights. There is more money in this trade
than one would think. Writer was for a
time a brigade adjutant near Cairo, and
among his jobs was the letting of con-
tracts to natives for minor services. That
most eagerly sought was the right to
collect the garbage from the regimental
messes, and rival contractors bid high
for the privilege, the money going to
brigade funds. The food from the cans,
cooked and uncooked, was carefully
separated from less edible matters, and,
after a period of reconditioning and fur-
bishing up, reappeared in various guises
in the meaner foodshops of the city or
on the trays of the itinerant vendors
who throng the streets of Cairo.

“Lord Luvus”: A Melbourne Health
Week story. A girl and a young man
in patent leather shoes got into the com-
partment at Prince’s Bridge. The young
man was chewing gum, but, finding this
activity interfered with the clear exposi-
tion of his views on current Collingwood
politics, he removed the sweetmeat and
parked it underneath his seat. A couple
of stations along the Heidelberg line the
girl got out. After she had gone the
youth put his hand down and searched
for the unfinished plug. Presently an
expression of surprise flitted across his
face, and his hand emerged. There were
two plugs in it. After surveying this
phenomenon for a few moments, he
glanced rapidly to right and left, and
swiftly placed both plugs in his mouth.

“X.S.”: Learned Judges in Melbourne
recently indulged in some verbal fisti-
cuffs in separate courts. Judge Foster
after sitting on a case for a week, heaved
a sigh at the end, and remarked, sotto
voce, “Thank goodness, the farce is at
an end.” Brother Lukin subsequently
took strong exception to the remark as
reflecting on a judgment that had eman-
ated from his court. Brother Foster then
explained that all he meant was that it
was a farce to expect a jury to pass an
opinion on a complex legal problem.
The case was one in which the mysteri-
ous term autrefois acquit came in ; to
the jury it was laboriously explained that
this meant that the defendant had already
been acquitted, and under British
law couldn’t be sentenced again, ex-
cept on an appeal. After yawning heavily
for seven days while the Gent. Ones
argued the jurymen simply took the
Bench’s view of the affair, and the world
rolled on.

“Wagga”: Our old N.S.W. town wit-
nessed an unusual spectacle during the
celebration of the centenary of the
Oxford movement, when a number of
monks and nuns took part in a big pro-
cession. They belong to Australian
religious orders which are linked up
with those in England. At a later meet-
ing one of the black-garbed speakers
mentioned that there are now some thou-
sands of members of religious orders
working within the Anglican Church.

“Nakhoda”: I have a relic (B.
15/11 /’33) which is probably the only
one of its kind in this country. It is the
stone head of a Buddha which un-
doubtedly came from Java, probably
from the Hindu temple of Burubudur,
where most of the multitudinous Buddha
images are headless, having been de-
capitated by Mohammedan zealots in the
thirteenth century. When I first saw it
it was in the bows of a Dutch liner and
was the mascot of the Javanese crew.
The exportation of antiquities has long
been prohibited by the Netherlands Indies
Government, but by bribing a Malay
quartermaster I smuggled it ashore at
Sydney. The only one-armed wharfie l
have ever met was hauling the box it was
in up a ladder when the hook in the
stump of his arm came out, the port-
manteau slid down the ladder and the
Buddha came through the bottom. How-
ever, I got it through the Customs. Its
subsequent vicissitudes include a sojourn
on loan in a museum and '■» a
journey from Adelaide to Melbourne
in a motor-car which wrecked the floor
of the vehicle. A few years ago I let my
house, and on resuming found my
Buddha head was missing. Search re-
vealed that it had been removed to the
woodshed, where it had served as a
chopping-block. It is still in excellent
preservation, however, and it is available
to the Felton Bequest if a genuine antique
is wanted.
ROOM FOR THIRTY MORE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Two lots of N.S.W. Leg. Councillors have been
chosen, and there are two more lots to be elected.”
Forth, when their country called,
Undaunted, unappalled,
Though cash in sight was not
And screw was nix,
They took their sturdy stand,
A patriotic band,
A heterogeneous lot,
Six score and six.
No mercenaries these,
C.Ps. or U.A.Ps.,
Comrades for Lang who whoop
Or Scullin Labs.,
They one and all have shown
Straight-off, 1 think you'll own,
They’re not the sort to stoop
To salary grabs.
Twice have the trumpets pealed,
Twice on the listed held
The champions have spurred
And caracoled;
And some ’mid loud hoorays
Have borne away the bays;
And some have got the bird,
Like knights of old.
Already chos’n and crowned
For this our Table Round,
Are thirty stalwarts whom
None might ignore.
Buck up, you other chaps!
Tighten your girths and straps,
Seeing there still is room
For thirty more.
Be stubborn, staunch and stout!
One fall won’t pass you out;
To bask in Fortune’s smile
There still is scope.
Jars and rebuffs despite,
Back to the ballot fight!
Always rememb’ring while
There’s life there r s hope.
Back to the combat, then.
Your barrows push like men
In booths where voters bunch
And pencils buzz.
What arts ’twere best to show
I don’t profess to know.
But I’ve a sort of hunch
That Trautwein does.
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Colonel Starbottle”: A Sydney jour-
nal, publishing the news that North
Carolina and South Carolina had stood
fast by prohibition, airily informed its
readers that what the Governor of N.C.
said to his opposite number of S.C. was
“Let’s have another drink.” Such ignor-
ance of the classics is appalling, even in
this material age. Those aristocrats of
the Old South were gentlemen and in-
capable of voicing their sentiments so
crudely and tactlessly. If there is any
virtue in sturdy tradition what the Gov-
ernor of N.C. did say was “It’s a d d
long time between drinks,” a phrase
which is embalmed in U.S.A. annals
alongside the noblest flights of Abe
Lincoln and Henry Clay.
* * * *
“Bullionist”: One of the weirdest
features of the currency tangle that fol-
lowed the dropping of the gold standard
was the premium placed on English-
minted silver coins in Australia, though
they contain less silver than the Aus-
tralian-minted article. Maoriland, which
uses the English silver, has for months
been making police raids on ships and
arresting persons suspected of smuggling
J. Bull coinage across the Tasman.
“Your husband has volunteered to try to swim ashore with a lifeline .”
“Just like the brute! Any excuse to give me the slip.”
Apparently police expenses exceeded the
revenue from fines and confiscations, so
11 was decided to institute a Maoriland
silver coinage. A proposal to establish
a local mint was knocked on the head
by the offer of the Royal Mint to do
the job buckshee, and the first consign-
ment—two million half-crowns—is now
making its way into circulation. The
“head” side is the same as ever, but the
“tail” bears the legend “New Zealand
Half-crown, 1933,” the centre being
filled with the Dominion’s arms and
some Maori carving devices. Why M.L.
sticks to the half-crown, which Austra-
lian experience has shown is unneces-
sary, isn’t explained. Maori Ms.P. have
asked that one of the new coins shall
have a tattooed Maori head on the
obverse—a design that for donkeys’ years
has decorated the one-pound notes of
the Bank of N.Z. As those notes must
go out of circulation now that the Re-
serve Bank is taking over the sole right
of note issue, the Maori request seems
not unreasonable. Finance Minister
Coates, however, says he doesn’t want
the world to get the impression that his
country is entirely populated by tat-
tooed natives (as the coins can’t be ex-
ported, that’s a bit thin), and it is on
the cards that if a Maori dial does get
on to the new currency it will be on the
threepenny-bit.

“Duko”: Petrol-drinkers (B. 8/11 /’33)?
While I was tinkering with the engine
of my Lizzie near Blacktown (N.S.W)
an old swagman produced a small pickle-
bottle and asked for a drop of petrol.
Unsuspectingly, ] obliged, and was
amazed to see him take a good swig of
the juice. I roared at him “That stuff
will kill you!’’ “No fear, mate,” came
the reply. “If petrol can make a big
motor-car go it can make me go. Why,
a bloke gave me some yesterday near
Katoomba for ’elpin’ to mend ’is tyre,
an' after a cuppler nobblers I picked up
me swag an’ did six miles an hour down
to Penrith.” He admitted being “a
methylated-spiritualist,” but added that
petrol would always serve him in the
absence of his favorite stimulant.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: Roderic Quinn (B.
8/11/ ’33) slips in describing the sound
of waves as “low, insistent and ever-
even.” There is no regularity about
breaking waves, be they big or small.
They mostly run in series of seven or
nine, followed by two which break
almost simultaneously. Then comes
a lull till the larger groups gather
again. Five minutes’ check on any beach
will prove my contention.
* * *
“Amity”: The Dramatic Club in our
N.S.W. country town stages a play once
a year, and this time we were congratu-
lating ourselves on having secured a
specially handsome hero and an appeal-
ing flapper heroine. It was at the last
rehearsal that the blow fell; the
plain but determined wife of the hero
suddenly emerged from the dimness of
the theatre and announced that she
would play the heroine. An astounded
company heard her in silence, but we
soon got her point that if she wasn’t
permitted to be the leading lady her hus-
band wasn’t going on next evening. We
might at a pinch have secured another
heroine, but the hero was irreplaceable,
and she knew it. Vainly the hero
stormed, and the heroine went home in
tears ; the determined interloper asserted
she knew the part perfectly, could wear
the frocks provided, and was just as
capable of playing as the departed
flapper. The house was booked up for
a week, so in the end she had her way.
Truth compels me to admit that she
was the success of the performance, but
the Dramatic Club died immediately
after. When it is re-formed we mean to
iook carefully over the wives of prospec-
tive heroes.
“What did old Jones want
to see in the undies
department to-day?”
“Me, to-night.”
“Exdig”: During the war
scores of funds for aiding
soldiers and their dependants
sprang into being ; a stock-
taking in 1922 disclosed 107
of such in N. S. Wales alone,
all with existing credits and little
or nothing to do with them. Quite
a number threw their balances into
Repatriation’s scheme for the education
of deceased soldiers’ children; others,
including War Chest, decided to help the
Barnardo enterprise. St. James’s Church,
Sydney, when the carnage of Mons was
fresh in the mind, raised £4BB to bring
the widows of British soldiers to Aus-
tralia, a proviso being that the benefi-
ciaries should not be over 35. There
were only two or three applicants for
help ; and the other day, after it had
been pointed out that British war widows
under 35 must be uncommonly rare to-
day, the church was given authority to
absorb the remaining cash in its general
funds.

“Choices”: Re this Tipperary song (B.
8/11/ ’33). The second verse begins
“Paddy wrote a letter to his Irish Molly-
-0,” and in the third Molly replies advis-
ing the wanderer to effect a quick return
owing to the matrimonial desires of one
Mike Moloney. That should settle Tip-
perary Gardens, Birmingham. Anyway,
the song was written in London. Jack
Judge wrote it, after a bet with Billy
West, a comic entertainer then appear-
ing at the Alhambra. Judge contended
that the mental reactions of a given audi-
ence could be psycho-analysed and a
song written that would be certain to take
with it. The stake was a fiver. Judge
wrote “Tipperary” in an hour or two,
and West sang it that evening. It
brought the house down, and Judge won
his fiver. Billy West featured the song
at the Alhambra for weeks after, but
when he went on his provincial tour it
was forgotten in London. But North o’
Tweed it was popular, and when the guns
started booming it came into its own.
Jack Judge got a fiver for it. How much
Billy West made I won’t tell you, but I
know. / was Billy West!

“C.H.F.”: Mention of Napoleonic
relics (B. 15/10/’33) recalls that at Nelson
(M.L.) there has been found a letter
allegedly written by Nelson just before
Trafalgar to Lady Hamilton. It is un-
finished (hence unsigned), the writer
stating that he hoped to finish it after the
battle. The letter is said to have come into
the possession of a midshipman after Nel-
son’s death, and to have been handed
down in the family ever since. The docu-
ment is going to England to be proved
authentic or otherwise ; the handwriting
is very like an original epistle of Nelson’s
in the Nelson Institute.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: There have been innum-
erable occasions when divine interven-
tion has been asked for succor against
afflictions, but probably the town of Car-
valhos, in Portugal, is the first to hold
religious processions and recite litanies
in order to combat a plague of ants. It
recalls that when the Portuguese estab-
lished themselves in Malacca they found
the tigers so bad that armed sentries
were even pounced on in the fort. It
is an old Malay belief that members of
certain tribes have the faculty of turn-
ing themselves into tigers and preying
on their neighbors’ cattle at night. The
Bishop of Malacca apparently had this
in mind when he held a public exorcism
ceremony and commanded all unclean
spirits to depart from the tigers on the
entire Malay Peninsula. It is duly re-
corded in history that after this event
the tigers ceased to prey on Christians,
contenting themselves with dining off
the heathen Mohammedan.

“Gentile”: “John P. Robinson, he, said
they didn’t know everything down in
Judee” ; but the Holy Land has been
catching up fast since the Jews started
to return thither. A recent “Tourist
Number” of the “Palestine Economic
Magazine” has a page ad. for the Judea
Insurance Co., Ltd. ; head office, Jerusa-
lem ; P. 0.8. 85 ; ’phone 23. The place
to stay at in Jerusalem is the King David
(eight storeys, 200 bedrooms, 120 baths,
central heating), and there’s a Ritzy
flavor about the Hotel Fast, which, as it
boasts of its bar and cuisine, doesn’t pro-
pose to starve its guests. For honey-
moon couples the Hotel Eden seems suit-
able. Cutting across Mount Sinai is the
railway to Egypt (corridor trains, restau-
rant and sleeping cars). The power in
the land is the Co-operative Society of
Orange-growers (headquarters, Jaffa).
The hot springs that made the Roman
baths at Tiberias famous are still in full
swing, under commercial management
(infallible cure for rheumatism, nerve and
skin diseases, etc.), and if you go to the
Dead Sea you can take a spin in a 40-
knot speedboat. At Haifa are the
Shemen Soap Works, Ltd. (olive-oil toilet
soap a specialty). Jerusalem to Bagdad
is a 30-hcur journey by Nathaniel’s
Motor ’Buses, and the Bank Yehudi at
Tel-Aviv specialises in small mortgages.
You can hop into a big ’plane at the
Haifa Aerodrome and fly to India.
Persia, Syria or Iraq. No wonder the
Arabs (who invented accountancy, but
didn’t go on with it) resent the homeward
flight of Jewry.
THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At a feminist debate held by the United Associa-
tions (Sydney), it was argued that life would be
deprived of most of its romance if women were given
the right to propose.”
A prospect, God bless us! to look at askance.
Reversing the role of the beau and the belle,
’Tis plain as a pikestaff, would shatter romance
And knock good old chivalry endways as
well.
And wouldn’t the writers of fiction rebel?
For where they would go for new plots Heaven
knows!
And what age-old impressions they’d have
to dispel
If women were given the right to propose!
Reformers might say it denoted advance
Toward equal conditions pour lui et pour elle;
But wouldn’t the playwrights distractedly dance
And the picture-producers dissentingly yell?
And the poets morosely ejaculate H —l!
To Romeo’s window when Juliet goes,
As she might, I imagine, her passion to tell,
If women were given carte blanche to propose?
It would start, I infer, at the picnic or dance.
All years would be leap years, whatever
befell,
With Dian the huntress alert for a chance
Of capturing Dennis, the timid gazelle.
Male debs, one might feature awaiting the
spell
Of glances that gladden and arms that enclose,
And in blessedness single there’s fewer might
dwell
If women were given the right to propose.
But, sisters, I’d ask, the discussion to quell,
And quite irrespective of cons and of pros,
As long as you’ve arts that proposals compel
What the deuce do you want with the right to
propose?

At tile age of 71, the unquenchable
Piddington has left for London to argue
the latest Leg. Council case—there is one
every year or so —before the Privy Coun-
cil. “Good ole Piddo” ; poor old Privy
Council!
Back in Canberra once more, Attor-
ney-General Latham is described by
Brian Penton, of Sydney “D.T.,” as
“acidulous, unforgiving and impatient of
fools.” Some of his colleagues consider
this grossly unjust to the A.-G., inas-
much as he’s not impatient of fools.
Two unvenerable U.S.A. institutions
got it in the neck during the same week
—Prohibition and Tammany. In good
times New York is a great city to loot;
but there has been less and less for Tam-
many and its clients since the depression
began, and its stocks have slumped
accordingly. When the situation became
desperate it tried to levy a huge toll on
the New York Stock Exchange. That
concern promptly moved to New Jersey ;
and the jig was up.
The N.S.W. Leg. Council ballots show
how free from party bias some members
can be. For instance, the preferences of
Roels, a Langster, were divided among
Mahony (Lang Lab.), L. W. Ryan (Fed.
Lab.), Tannock (Lang Lab.), Walder and
Wall (U.A.P.); they actually put Wall
and Walder in. Preferences of Akhurst,
once a Langster, but now an Independent
or something, went to Roels, Wall and
L. W. Ryan. If the House lasts
long enough, Stevens may yet become a
member by dint of Lang’s surplus votes.
Perhaps the most disgraceful feature
of the N.S.W. Leg. Council second ballot
was the elimination of James Ryan, the
honorary Minister. This newspaper
veteran is one of the most solid and level-
headed men in the State Parliament, cool
in crisis and dignified in be"havior. But
solid men, like solid objects, sink easiest
in a whirlpool.
Melbourne City Council has granted
Lud Mayor Smith extra munitions of
hospitality to meet the demands of the
centenary. He will have £3500 to spend,
an increase of £l5OO. If he doesn’t have
to dig down into his private pocket for
more it will be remarkable.
E. A. McLarty, managing trustee of
Westralia’s State Agricultural Bank, has
confided to a Royal Commission that his
concern has 1200 abandoned farms on
its books, and that “replacement of worn-
out horses and obsolete machinery” on
farms where settlers are still struggling
is “causing the trustees grave anxiety.”
Just before the secesh referendum the
Government opened an office in Mel-
bourne hoping to find buyers for the
abandoned farms. One way of getting
home on the Federal Oppressor.
Young Fairbairn wound up with a
majority of 14,319 over the Labor candi-
date for Flinders. Leaving out the
Communist’s votes, the margin was
greater than Bruce had at any of his
elections, except in 1931. Even in 1925
—Bruce-Page’s peak year —Bruce’s majo-
rity was no more than 13,425.
Flinders is one of the electorates which
will have to be cut up by a redistribution
commission. The Registrar found 78,000
electors there at the end of the month,
and it is doubtful if there are half as
many in Dr. Maloney’s Melbourne. No
doubt the Labor stronghold of Won-
thaggi will be shorn from it; Wonthaggi
is on the outskirts of Flinders. So if
Fairbairn’s health stands to him he will
probably hold the seat for many years.
Queensland branch of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, which has a Com-
monwealth award, has been trying to get
more favorable terms from the State In-
dustrial Court. An injunction restrain-
ing this move was issued by the Com-
monwealth Arbitration Court. Forgan
Smith announces that his Government
will appeal to the High Court against
the injunction. It will cost a bit, but
there is plenty of loan money about.
Stevens’s New States Commission
drags drearily on. The one bright spot
last week was an attempt to find out whom
Dr. Louat has behind him—he repre-
sents something called the N.S.W. State
Unity movement.
Mr. Jamieson: “May I have it noted that
you refuse to ask who Dr. Louat is?”
The Commissioner: “No! You may have it
noted that you asked me to do so.”
Country newspapers reported this
titbit; city papers ignored it. It looks
as if the sittings of the Commission will
last about a century and a half.
The House of Reps., following
Latham’s return, accepted the assurance
of the chairman of directors of Asso-
ciated Newspapers that the salary-grab
article, previously adjudged contemptu-
MISUNDERSTOOD.
“The Board of Associated Newspapers, while allowing that the article slating the salary grab
which it ‘unanimously’ condemns —was ‘garnished with somewhat highly-colored phrases
and broadly-used similes....to arrest attention,’ insists that ‘imputations....were not intended,’
and ‘regrets that many members of the Federal House should have misunderstood the
position.’ ”
“Sure, Oi did tear his uniform an’ damage his face an’ call him a thafe an’ a
lot more; but Oi didn’t mane annything. He misunthershtood the posi-
tion, yer ’Anner.”
ous, was not meant to be derogatory to
members as individuals. It was displayed
right across the first page of a paper
which claims that “its net sales exceed
those of any two other Sunday newspapers
in Australia,” was printed in type the
size of a demagogue’s last wish, and gar-
nished with phrases like “thief in the
night,” “furtive fashion of sneaks,” and
“organise their dip into the public purse
with the celerity and secrecy of a pick-
pocket” ; but the chairman of direc-
tors expressed “regrets” that so “many
members misunderstood the position.”
A majority echoed the “regrets”; so
honor is satisfied.
The Peacock lady’s accession to the
Allandale seat presents fresh problems
for Vic. legislators. There is the ques-
tion of hats. It was raised when Lady
Astor entered the House of Commons ;
she compromised by assuming a small
but attractive lid. Miss Holman, of
Westralia, dispenses with headgear —
without bringing the millennium any
nearer.
Government employees like McGirr,
of the Western Lands Board, Martin,
of the Metropolitan Milk Board, and
Magrath, sometime Deputy Industrial
Commissioner, were members of the old
N. S. Wales Leg. Council,-and McGirr
and Magrath are to sit in the “re-
formed” House —without pay, of course,
in Westralia one Alec Clydesdale
is paid chairman of the Lotteries
Commission and salaried M.L.C. The
Mitchell Government made him boss of
the lotteries, and when a former Labor
politician brought an action to test
whether Clydesdale could remain an
M.L.C. and hold an office of profit under
the Crown, the Labor party, its oppo-
nents helping, passed a special law to dish
the litigant. It is doubtful whether this
legislation can really remove the con-
stitutional bar ; in any case, it looks and
smells bad.
Keith McGarvie, farmer and grazier,
succeeds Fairbairn as M.L.A. for Warr-
nambool. H. S. Bailey, the former Labor
Lands Minister, who stood as an Inde-
pendent and Premiers’-plan supporter, had
a good lead at the end of the first count,
but 81 p.c. of Glasgow’s second prefer-
ences went to the U.A.P. man. Glasgow
is a Cocky, and his party is pleased with
his showing. Most of the Labor voters in
the electorate disobeyed A.L.P. orders
and gave their primaries to Bailey ; and
more than half of those who declared
for the Trades Hall candidate, Gill,
marked Bailey No. 2 instead of No. 4,
as instructed.
Health Week in Melbourne produced
the usual epidemic of addresses and talks
and appeals to the people to eat more
fruit, give more milk to their babies and
take all sorts of hygienic and dietetic
measures to ensure a long life and a
happy one. While the frenzy was at
its height a man was charged with
assaulting his wife. There are four
children, and it turned out that the total
family income was seven shillings a
week. ’Sonah expressed his surprise that
in a country “crammed so full of
food and clothing” two adults and
their four children should have to live
on an allowance hardly sufficient for the
upkeep of an Alsatian dog.
A thing that sticks out from the police
inquiry in Melbourne is that the police
have on occasion to work in with the
criminal element, whether they like it or
not. Yet there are people who seem to
ihink the police ought to stand about
and wait until they are called, like the
fire brigade. The difficulty is that per-
sons who handle pitch are liable to get
defiled.
War scares have become perennial in
the Far Yeast. The Soviet was lately re-
ported to have shot down half a dozen
Japanese ’planes alleged to be inspecting
the defences of Vladivostok. There was
talk of war in Moscow and Tokio, and
even more discussion of it in London and
New York. Then it was explained that
the outrage never occurred.
The Argyles will shortly present Mel-
bourne with the largest park in the
metropolis. It comprises Studley Park
and the so-called National Park, with 300
acres taken from the Kew Asylum
grounds—looo acres in all. The Yarra
and the Boulevard wind through it. The
asylum is to be removed to Bundoora
when the Ministry can find £500,000.
Part of the land it stands on will be sub-
divided for residential purposes, so that
the scheme will pay for itself in part.
As the bushfire season approaches,
people in the Dandenongs and Gipps-
land are remembering what happened
seven years ago, when 17 people were
burned alive. The position to-day is no
better, undergrowth in the State forests
having grown luxuriantly in the interim.
In some of the little wooden townships
huddled in funnel-shaped gullies amidst
the densest jungle in Vic., citizens are
already digging holes in the ground.
There is an admirable fire-prevention
service, with its headquarters in the
metropolis, but when the wind reaches 60
miles an hour and 100 smouldering logs
wake up, it is as effective as a sea anchor
to an iceberg.
Every few weeks or so there is a
wrangle at Sydney Town Hall as to
whether rates should be paid on church
property not expressly exempted by Lang
and McGirr. The latest was wilder than
usual:
Jackson, M.L.A.: “Aldermen of my party
have to put up with vile abuse. An alderman
has made a practice of saying that he is lead-
ing a boycott against me. If he will publicly
announce it I will deal with him.”
Garden (who wants to be M.H.R.): “I am
not a bigot like Alderman Jackson. I have
advocated within the Labor party for years
that a Labor Government should grant State
aid to all denominational schools. That has
now been adopted by the Labor party, and
will be put into effect.”
So it was this Communist candidate for
Sydney who induced the Lang group to
go back on the 40-year-old secular edu-
cation policy. What an asset this person
has been to the anti-Labor parties!
“Wandana”: Touching that peace
expedition to Caledon Bay, “X.J.”
(B. 8/11/’33) is rather under-estimat-
ing the Rev. H. E. Warren’s local
knowledge. Mr. Warren, until he moved
south a couple of years back, had been
in Arnhem Land for 20 years. As for
the Caledon Bay people, if his advice
concerning the folly of allowing irre-
sponsible whites and Japanese to inter-
fere' with native property (human and
otherwise) had been followed, there
would have been none of this trouble.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
The Queensland Governor’s new pri-
vate secretary, C. Feilden, is a son of
Major Percy H. G. Feilden, late of the
King’s Royal Rifles, who was A.D.C. to
Sir Henry W. Norman, Governor of
Queensland in 1889. Young Feilden,
who is only 26, was educated at Shrews-
bury School and later Magdalene Col-
lege, Cambridge. He is a Coldstreamer,
and has served in both West and East
Africa.
Queensland’s latest centenarian, Lud-
wig Kurth, of Grey-street, Ipswich, claims
to be the oldest German settler in Aus-
tralia. Born in Prussia he arrived in
Queensland in 1865, and was engaged in
bridge-building for many years, helping
to construct the first bridge over the
Brisbane River at Spencer’s Crossing. He
later took up farming and retired about
20 years ago. A*t 92 he contracted double
pneumonia, and for a long time his life
hung in the balance, but to-day he is hale
and hearty.
George Crowley’s death came as a
shock to his friends. He did not look
his 67 years, and seemed in normal
health. A Fort-street boy, he had been
City Mutual’s manager for 43 years, and
for a long period he also was chair-
man of the board. No financial contro-
versy for years was complete without a
few words from George Crowley’s pen,
and in his own circles he was regarded as
a sort of financial demigod. Scullin
offered him a seat on the Commonwealth
Bank Board in 1930, but he declined. In
his younger days he was a good man to
have in a rowing eight, but latterly golf,
angling and horticulture were his pas-
times.
Herbert Bird and Ted Pratt, Kidman’s
secretary and station-inspector, are back
in Adelaide, after a motor run of five
weeks and 2500 miles. They went by
Marree, Birdsville, Diamantina, Morney
Plains, Innamincka, Cooper’s Creek,
Durham Downs and finally down the
border fence to Cockburn. The party
met the very old Ned Pender, who used
to work for Tyson.
K. McGARVIE ( U.A.P. ), who won the
Warrnambool (Vic.) seat after a close
tussle with Independent H. S. Bailey.
Hugo Throssell, V.C., has died tragi-
cally in Perth. Son of the Throssell who
was Forrest’s colleague and successor as
Westralian Premier, Hugo (“Jim”) had a
farm at a place called Cowcowing when
the war gong sounded in 1914. He left
for Gallipoli with the 10th Light Horse,
and earned his V.C. when the Tenth, as the
regimental poet wrote, “got it in the Nek”
(the poet was Olden, afterwards Colonel
of the regiment and the first officer into
Damascus). Throssell was twice wounded
on that occasion, and suffered a worse
knock in 1917, when his brother Frank
was killed. After the war he was en-
gaged in soldier-settlement work for the
Government. His widow is Katharine
Susannah Prichard, the novelist, who is
abroad getting material for another book ;
there is one small son.
Victor Elliott is probably Australia’s
best-known business chemist, for, prior
to becoming chairman of directors of
the Elliott and Australian Drug Com-
pany, he worked in every department of
the firm established by his grandfather.
VICTOR ELLIOTT, head of the great
druggist firm which hears his name.
He is a practical man in chemistry, and
knows every section of his factory and
warehouse. For many years he was
director of the chemical works and
laboratories at Balmain, where the busi-
ness was first established. He is still in
the prime of life, although he has been
in the chair ten years. Sailing and golf
are his recreations.
James Parr will replace Thomas Wil-
ford in London as M.L. High Commis-
sioner just for one year. He went there
previously in 1926, after a long and useful
career in public life. He became Auck-
land’s Mayor in 1911, and held the job
until 1915. Knighthood came in 1925,
after Parr had been in Parliament
eleven years, and in the Ministry five. He
never held less than two portfolios at a
time, and during 1925-26 was Postmaster-
General, Minister of Justice and Minister
of Education. Soon after his return in
1930 he joined the Upper House and
became its leader. Parr has represented
M. at the League of Nations Assembly
on four occasions, and was a member of
the Imperial Defence Committee in 1928.
Rear-Admiral Ford, who succeeds
Admiral Dalglish as commander of the
R.A.N., once commanded the navi-
gation school at Portsmouth. During
the war years he was aboard H.M.S.
Swiftsure, Glorious and Valiant as
navigation officer. In 1920 he became
a captain, and after several commands
went ashore as director of physical train-
ing and sports and captain-in-charge at
Berwick. Ford commanded the Royal
Oak from 1929 to 1930. Australians will
like him, and no doubt he’ll like Australia,
as he is a good mixer with a pronounced
sense of humor.
Maxwell P. Dunlop, who polled so
well in the second ballot for N.S.W.
Upper House, is the official head of
N. dairy farmers. Last March, in
recognition of 14 years’ service as general
secretary, he was made president. He has
grown up with organised dairying, and
has been officially connected with the
Primary Producers’ Union since its in-
ception 18 years ago. Prior to that date
he served 11 years at the shrine of Straw-
berry. If he doesn’t know what the
cockies want, no one does. Before
switching over to dairying he served an
apprenticeship with wool and wheat. His
early days were spent with Goldsbrough,
Morts at Melbourne.
Ernest T. Hall, whose retirement as
Comptroller of Customs was announced
last week, has been connected with
tariffs all his working life. He joined
Vic. Customs as junior clerk in 1888,
and before Federation was private
secretary to several Victorian Ministers.
His first really big job came in 1916,
when he went to New York to open an
Australian Customs office there. Since
his return four years later, he has been
Collector at Adelaide, Deputy Comp-
troller-General of Customs, chairman of
the Tariff Board, and Comptroller-
General —he was appointed in 1927.
He gathered a C.B.E. in 1929, and is
still a youngster, 62. E. Abbott, his
deputy, will probably take his place—a
sane, upright man, who was one of the
Government’s advisers at Ottawa last
year.
Alexander Kennedy, founder of many
Queensland stations, who has celebrated
his 98th birthday at Auchenflower, Bris-
bane, in good health, can remember when
all his neighbors were killed at Bucking-
ham Downs (N.Q.) by the Kalkadoons. A
party of them was speared while swim-
ming in the Long Waterhole. The old
pioneer came from Perthshire, Scotland,
60 years ago, and until his retirement
lived on the Barcoo and Georgina and in
the Gulf country. He still visits his
Mt. Isa relatives by ’plane, but recalls
the days when the one-and-a-half-day
’plane journey was a long trek with many
changes of transport—a horse ride 500
miles to Normanton, a lugger to T. 1., and
then a 8.1. steamer to Brisbane.
F. C. P. Curlewis, who visited Sydney
and Melbourne on business recently—
he says he lost a lot of sugar at
the Cup—succeeded G. H. Pritchard as
general secretary of' the Sugar Pro-
ducers’ Association and business manager
of the “Sugar Journal.” He is a native
of Geelong and a product of Melbourne
Grammar. He started his career as a
shipping clerk, then took on vinegrowing,
F. C. P. CURLEWIS, the Australian
Sugar Producers' secretary.
and after 17 years in the south went to
Cairns (N.Q.) as a canegrower. He has
had wide experience in industrial matters,
and was a member of the Committee of
Inquiry, on the Sugar Industry in 1930-31.
He is interested in gardening, and his
home at Kelvin Grove, Brisbane, is a
picture.
Arthur Gibson Manning, once Whip to
the Bruce-Page Government, is a quiet,
solid chap with a big wheat farm up in
the country where places have names
like Yalgogrin and Ungarie. He has been
a working farmer most of his life, though
a few years in politics holding seats
which had been regarded as for-
lorn hopes added more silver to his
hair than decades behind the plough.
He entered the N. S. Wales State
House as M.L.A. for Albury in 1917,
A. G. MANNING, formerly M.H.R. and
League of Nations delegate, now a
wheat-farmer.
and won the Macquarie Federal seat
in 1922 and 1925. As chairman of
the Select Committee on the Electoral
Act, just before he went to England as
one of the Australian delegates to the
League of Nations in 1926, he did good
work. Manning was one of the soundest
commonsense speakers in the Reps, in his
day, and probably would have been a
Minister if he had not been defeated in
1928, since Bruce had a great personal
regard for him.
Victoria’s Rhodes scholar for this year,
L. R. D. Pyke, has the usual 50/50
record required. A Wesley College pro-
duct, he made an early habit of being
dux in the schoolroom and out of it.
At Queen’s College, Melb. University,
he scored first-class honors in natural
philosophy and chemistry, and has his
football blue. His mother was Lillian
M. Pyke, who wrote novels on Aus-
tralian school life.
Following the death of W. H. Smith,
Theo Wood becomes acting-chief of the
Queensland “Hansard” staff, of which he
has been a member for many years. A
Brisbane Grammar School boy, he was
trained under J. R. H. Lewis on the
“Telegraph,” serving the usual stern
apprenticeship in shorthand to which the
fine old sub-editor subjected his cadets.
Then he was called to the Bar, but a shy
nature and a quiet sense of humor pre-
vented him from takiqg himself seriously
enough to become a K.C. So he joined
the recorders of Forganisms and Moore-
osities.
“Too old at 65” will cast four lead-
ing officers of Vic. Education Depart-
ment adrift next year —J. S. Jensen,
the accountant; R. H. Croll, registrar,
Council of Public Education ; W. Web-
ster, chief clerk, and G. M. Wallace, edi-
tor of departmental publications. Croll
and Webster are “Bob” and “Billy” to
each other, for they were Stawell school-
mates. Webster can name each teacher
in 2700 Victorian schools. Croll,
waltzing Matilda through the back-
blocks on nature-trips, kept a wary
eye on tiny schools and their teachers;
and did them innumerable good turns.
Wallace started his literary career
under the tutelage of Archibald, of
The Bulletin ; and Jensen, in scatter-
ing his millions, has helped innumerable
teachers in preparing their salary abstracts
in shipshape style.

Having merged the interests of Sun News-
papers, Ltd., and S. Bennett, Ltd. Asso-
ciated Newspapers bought the goodwill of
the daily and Sunday “Guardian” from
Smith’s Newspapers for £575,000 —
£400,000 in prefs. and the balance cash.
Then, to protect the earnings of the chief
contributors to the pool (the daily and
Sunday “Sun”), publication of the
“Guardian,” the “Telegraph Pictorial”
and, after some recriminations and
changes on the board, of the “Evening
News,” too, was discontinued ; but the
“Daily Telegraph” was afterwards re-
vived.
All this left the co. with a top-
heavy capital structure. So, to “remove
assets which had no earning capacity,”
half the ord. capital was jettisoned during
the last term, reducing the figure to
£1,052,020. This enabled the co. to rub
out £577,471 at which the goodwill of
the “Guardian” had been capitalised,
together with £9150 of preliminary exes.,
and to lop £465,500 off the figure at
which shares in the Bennett Co. appeared
(now £171,982). The prefs. (£1,489,619,
7 p.c. cumulative) were not interfered
with.
After deducting a small loss on realisa-
tion of “Guardian” assets, the year’s net
income from trading and investments
sprang £44,328, due, apparently, to a
bigger contribution from the Sun Co. —
no hint is given as to whether the “Tele-
graph” has yet turned the corner. A
factor which may have helped the figures
was the demise of the “World” —many
still wonder at what cost, if any, to
the Associated interests. The Bennett Co.
appears to have made an unspecified loss,
raising its p. and 1. debit to £124,281,
not taken into account in this holding
co.’s p. and 1. figures:
1931. 1932. 1933.
From subsidiaries . . £103,908* £133,015 £177,343
Exes 37,277 26,862 21,550
Net £66,631 £106,153 £155,793
* After deducting loss on “Guardian.” £15,777.
Including £lO,OOO reserved for taxation,
exes, were £5312 lighter, making the net
improvement £49,640. After handing the
prefs. their £80,862 (7 p.c. less 22} p.c.
statutory cut and 2s. in the £ special tax
on income from property), enough re-
mained to show 7.2 p.c. on the £1,052,120
of ord. capital, and 5 p.c. is being distri-
buted—the first thing of its kind since the
merger.
At the moment, prospects of the ords.
remaining in the picture are favorable.
Provided nothing unexpected happens,
the daily and Sunday “Suns” promise to
continue to give a good account of them-
selves ; much, of course, will depend
upon the help, if any, that the “Tele-
graph” and the minor weeklies are able
to give, and upon what the Bennett
Co. is able to do with its building and
idle plant. The market now prices the
pound ords. at 21s. ; a year ago the
old paper fetched 4s. 4d. Over the same
period the prefs. advanced from 16s. Id.
to 20s. 4d. Allowing for the statutory
cut and tax deduction, the return at 20s.
4d. is 5 p.c.
To pay a further £31,500 to Smith’s
on account of the “Guardian” (leaving
£42,000 to come over the next couple of
years), carry an extra £42,977 of debtors’
balances, etc., and £4789 more stocks,
only £5716 was added to the amount
coming to sundry creditors:—•

The year’s improvement in the financial
position was £73,550, liabilities exceed-
ing stocks and debtors’ balances by
£17,747 when the books closed. The
shareholding in Sun Newspapers, Ltd.
(970,498 £1 shares paid to 18s. and 33,400
10s. shares paid to 95.), figures at
£2,516,331, or over £1,402,000 more than
its net tangible book value, while the
Bennett Co.’s scrip (424,988 fully-paid
pound shares) appears at £164,000-odd
less than its net tangible book value
(£336,355). So the whole of Associated’s
ords. and a shilling or so of its pref. capi-
tal is unrepresented to tangibles in the
books.

Shareholders in this snug little concern
have fared much better than most over
the last four years. Certainly the 5 p.c.
bonus was dropped in ’3l, but it was
restored in the following year, and 15
p.c. was repeated for the last term,
when a one-for-five new share issue at
par was in the nature of a bonus, the
scrip commanding a substantial premium
on the market —the new capital was used
to finance further expansion of the Mel-
bourne business. Moreover, 15 p.c. is
worth a lot more to old holders, nearly
two-thirds of the capital having been pro-
vided out of surplus earnings.
Though the general slackness affected
turnover for a while, more products are
now being packed in the co.’s all-Austra-
lian fibre-boxes, etc., thanks to the tariff,
exchange and the enterprise of James
Fielding, the founder and managing direc-
tor of the business. Also, receipts from a
sound group of outside investments form
“a handsome contribution to manufac-
turing profits.” After striking off £17,614
more than was spent on fixed assets, the
accounts claimed £32,096 of profit for
the last term, or £2411 more than for
the previous year. Taking unexplained
additions to visible reserves into the
reckoning, the net result was 18.6 p.c.
on capital as against 26.5, 10.8, 15.4,
27.4, 27 and 24.3 p.c. back to 1927.
To provide, when necessary, for fur-
ther expansion of the business, nominal
capital has been increased from £lBO,OOO
to £300,000 by the creation of 120,000
new £1 shares. But no hint has yet been
given as to when any or all of these may
be issued. The market, which thinks
that it may not have to wait long for its
benefits, prices the pound shares at 625.
6d. as against 295. two years ago. The
immediate return at 625. 6d. is 4.8 p.c.
on a 15 p.c. distribution. The cover is
visibly 335. 7d. in net tangibles.
Finances are snug:

Including the allowance for depreciation,
shown as written off in the table, the
year’s loss was £6409 lighter at £37,721,
making total losses over the last three
years £138,232, and reducing the book
value of the tangible support for capital
to £56,117 at Aug. 5. The existence of
this reserve depends entirely on the
value placed upon the assets in the
books. Half of last year’s loss was in-
curred during the first three months of
the term. Since then the co. has been
steadily gaining ground, and it hopes to
finish up the current term on the right
side of the ledger. Only careful manage-
ment has enabled it to thus far avoid
greater losses.
It used to be a steady 10 p.c. proposi-
tion with satisfactory margins, but slump
caught the co. with substantial stocks and
over £579,000 of book debts, mainly on
a t.-p. basis. Stocks have been adjusted
to new trading conditions, but unem-
ployment, which reached its peak during
the second quarter of 1932, the mora-
torium and the 12s. 6d. cut in the N. S.
Wales basic wage in August, 1932, made
the debts question a perplexing problem.
Another factor which hit the co. severely
was the Government’s action in forcing
privately-owned ’buses off the roads ; no
fewer than 276 ’buses went to and from
Central Station in September, 1931.
However, sales and collections increased
as conditions improved, and, though some
10,000 of the co.’s customers are still un-
employed, new accounts have recently
totalled from 500 to 900 monthly.
During the term debtors’ balances were
reduced by £20,039, and stocks by
£16,084, while £6331 was chipped off the
amount coming to sundry creditors, and
£1635 was added to mortgages:

The year’s contraction in the more or less
liquid surplus (£73,576, including stocks
but not shares) was £31,183. Sharehold-
ings, which appear at approximately face
value, are not worth their book figure.
They consist mostly of ords. in Bon

A’s and 297,000 B's, both 7 p.c. cumula-
tive, and ranking in the order stated for
dividend and capital. The new manage-
ment adopted a vigorous trading policy,
similar to that which proved successful
in the parent’s own State ; there was a
clearance of old stocks, and profits almost
disappeared in 1929; the organisation
was overhauled, premises were re-
modelled, and attention was given to the
manufacture of much of the co.’s require-
ments locally—Holden’s old King Wil-
liam-street freehold was bought to house
some of the manufactures.
Hence the figures have continued to
improve, despite difficulties. During the
last term the spring in gross earnings
(£262,321) was £12,920. Prices eased, so
the growth in the volume of trade was
better than the spring the figures suggest.
Exes. (£215,184, including £10,500 set
aside for the taxgatherer) took £10,844
of the increase, leaving enough to pay
the pref. divs. and show 6.4 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 5.7, 3.4 and 2.1 p.c. for
the three preceding years. The ords. got
5 p.c., and look like staying in the pic-
ture ; the outlook favors improved earn-
ings.

added during the half-dozen years to the
close of accounts in 1930. The co. is in
the wholesale dry-goods business; it turns
out several high-grade and well-estab-
lished proprietary lines, including oat-
meal, cornflour, starch and rice, and
handles tea and other Asiatic lines
as well. The business appears to have
held remarkably well, despite competition
and the swing of t demand towards
cheaper-priced goods* carrying narrower
profit margins, while the new plants, in-
stalled just before the big break in prices,
have helped to keep down costs.
After providing for contingencies, set-
ting aside £7OOO (£lO,OOO in the previous
year) for the taxgatherer, and again
openly reserving £5OO for doubtful debts,
there was a spring of £2195 in last year’s
declared net result, which was 11.9 p.c.
on capital as against 10.9, 12, 13, 15.5,
15.4, 15.6 and 17.1 p.c. back to 1926.
That was after £750 had been added to
the insurance account (£8660) and the
reserve for contingencies and deprecia-
tion (£109,911) drawn upon for £3135.
Neither of these accumulations is in-
cluded with the lay-by in the table, the
lot being subject to £72,500, at which
trade-marks, etc., appear.
Prospects of the co. making a better
showing at next balance appear to be
bright enough. So the market pays 50s.
for the scrip as against 38s. a year ago.
At the higher figure the return is 4 p.c.
on a 12 p.c. div. basis. Including the in-
surance and depreciation reserves, the net
tangible cover is 38s. Id.

During the year £10,470 more was spent
on fixed assets than was written off, while
£9907 was added to the stocks item, and
£18,461 to the trade debt. The slip in the
more or less liquid surplus (£69,816, in-
cluding stocks) was £11,674. Debtors’
balances were £3099 lighter.
The Loan
Last week the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment offered £10,000,000 of 3j p.c.
Consols at £99. The lot was snapped
and the loan closed within 48 hours,
thanks largely to the support of the
banks and the insurance cos., to which
an effective return of £3 12s. sd. per cent.,
plus a little relief from the burden of
taxation, means much in these days of
cheap money and idle funds.
In the sixties of last century the Aus-
tralian State Governments had to pay
over 6j p.c. for money raised by deben-
tures in London. In 1874 the rate had
fallen to a wink over 4\ p.c.; it fluctuated
between that point and 3| p.c. till 1895,
when the figure sank to 3 p.c., and re-
mained thereabouts till the beginning of
this century. Then severe drought
changed the outlook, and N. S. Wales had
to pay about 4 p.c. for accommodation
in 1903-04; but it was able to issue 3£
p.c. stock at par in 1908. It was not until
May, 1912, that the local rate on funded
stock rose to 4 p.c. After that the war,
inflationary finance, the post-war boom
and speculative activity led to a period
of dear money, which slump brought to
an end.
The next step along the road to re-
covery is the renewal of capital expendi-
ture by traders, not on the old scale, but
within the limits of savings ; and noth-
ing can hasten this more than confidence,
born of stable political and financial con-
ditions, both here and overseas.
Tin
In a survey of the international tin-re-
striction scheme, O. T. Lempriere, head
of the ore-buying firm of the same name,
and chairman of Sugarloaf Tin, said that
the five signatory countries have ex-
tended their agreement to 1937, and in-
creased the export quota from 33 1-3 p.c.
to 40 p.c., plus a special increase of 4
p.c. for 1934. This means that the aggre-
gate export quota for 1934 will be over
80,000 tons as against 64,056 tons this
year. Including tin held by the Pool,
Mr. Lempriere put visible stocks at
55,704 tons a year ago, 49,647 tons six
months back, and 33,845 tons at the
end of last month.
The new agreement provides that if
supplies from other sources exceed 25
p.c. of the new quota for six consecutive
months, then any signatory to the agree-
ment may give six months’ notice of
its intention to withdraw from the
scheme. In the event of such withdrawal,
the other signatories may abandon the
whole thing. The other sources of supply
referred to are the non-signatory coun-
tries, which include China, French Indo-
China, Belgian Congo, Japan, Portugal,
Mexico, Burma, the U.K. and Aus-
tralia. In 1932 non-signatory countries
produced some 16,000 tons ; in addition,
supplies of secondary or reconditioned tin
amounted to about 6000 tons. Thus, on
the basis of the new quota plus produc-
tion from other sources, total visible
world supplies of the metal will exceed
100,000 tons next year.
The provision for withdrawal from
the new agreement arose out of fear
that, with high prices, non-restricted
countries might expand their production
to a point which would bring about the
collapse of the whole scheme. Such a
possibility also explains why the Inter-
national Restriction Committee recently
approached the Governments of non-
participating countries asking for sup-
port for the restriction policy by at least
a limitation of their respective exports.
China, the chief non-signatory producer,
with an estimated annual output of 5000
tons, is said to have consented. The in-
tentions of other countries may be an-
nounced before the end of the year. Aus-
tralia’s exports of tin for the 12 months
to June 30 last were a little over 1000
tons. She is thus not a serious factor
in the matter of world supplies. More-
over, because the industry here is a small
man’s industry, it would be difficult to
apply any method of curtailment with-
out affecting the livelihood of a large
number of individuals.
The Mountain Maid, Croydon (N.Q.),
has been taken up by Cliff Rutledge for
the N.Q. G. M. Development Co., which
also holds Mt. Wandoo. The Maid,
worked from 1886 to 1904, was one of
the biggest “outside” producers of the
field ; over 30,000 tons of quartz were
crushed for 23,1000 z. of gold. The metal
averaged 635. an ounce, which is con-
siderably higher than the general average
for Croydon. The reef itself has been
traced for the best part of a mile at the
surface, and is Bft. thick in some of the
best claims. It took a knock-back when
the Mountain Maid United deep shaft
failed to find payable stone. The co.
got the reef, but it had no funds with
which to finance an extensive search
for shoots. With gold above £7 an
ounce the show has a very good chance
of becoming a big medium-grade pro-
ducer.
* * * *
Forsayth Gold Mines is dewatering the
Queenslander and testing the Big Reef,
a huge quartz outcrop that has the repu-
tation of averaging from 4dwt. to sdwt.
The last co. that worked the Queens-
lander left a good shoot going under-
foot in the bottom levels ; still, there are
considered to be good pickings of high-
grade stone in some of the shallower
workings. Extensive sampling is to be
undertaken ; upon the results will depend
the policy of development. One thing
that looks certain is the deepening of the
main shaft to secure backs on the ore-
body.

The Clermont (C.Q.) leads still hold a
goodly number of miners, but few are
getting anything special in the way of
returns. The party on the Cumberland
Last Resource are doing best; during the
last four months they obtained over
4500 z., worth about £3OOO. Prospects are
a gamble, there being nothing much to
guide the men till they strike bottom,
often over 70ft. down. Still, it’s a gamble
that holds them to it, for the chances of
making a rise are considered very fair.

A five-ton parcel from the Boomerang,
on the Gilded Rose line of reef, 10 miles
s.-e. of Cloncurry (Q.), returned 430 z.
ldwt. of gold, making 128yOZ. from 52f
tons extracted since the mine was opened
up at the beginning of the year. The
shaft is down 50ft., and the reef “bulgy
and somewhat erratic.” The Sauce Bottle,
Sweat Box and Big Rose are also on
reefs carrying payable values.

“Old Warden”: Papua will shortly
boast its first gold dredge, which is to
work an area held by the Tiveri Gold
Dredging Co. 100 miles or so west of
Port Moresby, and not far from the old
Lakekamu goldfield, which yielded so
much rich alluvial 30 years ago. The
dredge has been specially designed to
facilitate carriage in small sections by
natives during the last portion of the
journey to the ground. Poole and Steel,
of Balmain, who have built so many
dredges for Malayan tin cos., are respon-
sible for the neat job. The buckets are
of only \\ cubic feet capacity, and two
suction-gas engines, the gas being gen-
erated from locally-made charcoal, will
supply the power. The Tiveri is thick
jungle country, and aeroplanes are out of
the question. If the co.’s experiment suc-
ceeds, the way should be opened to
similar methods on some of the rich but
casually worked fields of earlier days,
notably the Yodda, in the Northern
Division.

it he and his mate got several thousand
ounces of alluvial and dollied gold. The
ground has been since turned over many
times by dryblowers, and the lodes there-
abouts became poor at shallow depths.
Ingliston Extended was worked for years
by a small co., bossed by the late F. B.
Trude and others. It produced a lot of
gold, but became impoverished at depth,
and the co. gave up. Recently a new
make of payable stuff was struck in
deeper country by local fossickers.

Lake View and Star is said to be pre-
paring for an increase in the capacity of
its treatment plant from 45,000 to 50,000
tons a month. Admirers of the stock
reckon that the extra gold obtained from
this increase will enable the co. to dis-
tribute 4s. a year.

G. Hack and party are opening up the
old Imperial, Widgiemooltha (W.A.),
which was worked over 30 years ago,
when 3000 tons averaged sdwt. over the
plates. From an open cut 78 tons re-
cently averaged 10dwt., and some rich
stuff has been taken from a leader.
Several hundred tons will shortly be put
through the local battery. In the shaft,
a tributor has cut a lode 6ft. wide at
118 ft. A 50-ton parcel, expected to
average 10dwt., is being taken out.

Success still keeps out of reach of the
Mutooroo Co. (W.A.). Since the Went-
worth option was abandoned a few
months ago, several so-called attractive
ventures have been overhauled, but none
has been good enough to justify spend-
ing money on.
* * ‘ * *
After crushing small lots during the
last year or two at a mill 20 miles
away, Kimberley Options (W.A.) has
bought a plant to treat stuff on the spot
for the tributors who are working the
show. In the hands of a co. with stronger
financial backing more might have been
expected.
QUESTION ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Capital details, etc., of cos. which have been
absorbed by Lake View and Star, Ltd. ? —9054.
Lake View and Star, Ltd., was registered in
London, May 2, 1910, to acquire properties of
Lake View Consols, Ltd., and Hannan’s Star
Consolidated, Ltd. Each vendor received
500,000 fully-paid 4s. shares. Late in 1915 the
Chaffers (capital, £132,679 in 4s. shares) mine and
plant were bought for £11,115, and in July,
1924, the mine of the Ivanhoe Gold Corp.
(capital, £1,000,000 in £5 shares) was purchased
lor 400,000 f.-p. 4s. shares, Ivanhoe taking up
another 100,000 shares for cash. The property
of Golden Horseshoe Estates Co., adjoining the
Chaffers ground, was acquired in March, 1929,
for 900,000 f.-p. 4s. shares. Horseshoe tailing
dumps were excluded from sale. Total area
now held by Lake View and Star 570 acres.
Paid capital, £520,000 in 2,600,000 4s. shares.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
F.A.: A gamble with possibilities. Should
co. exercise its option over Balmain Colliery,
Sydney Collieries (in liq.) will be entitled to
take 100,000 2s. shares in part consideration.
... .T.E.K.: (1) Points of nibs for fountain-
pens. (2) Tasmania, S. Africa and New Guinea.
(3) Belongs to platinum group, and is often
associated with serpentine rocks. It is darker
in appearance than platinum... .L.J.M.: (1)
As a speculation, yes; but you may have to
wait. As a long-term investment Morris Hed-
strom is worth consideration. (2) Write Secre-
tary Stock Exchange, Brisbane D.J.A.: All
new concerns are more or less speculative; if
you cannot afford to lose, keep out... .V.C.L.:
(1) Very doubtful. (2) Sell if you can get a
fair price, though there may be an attempt to
boost the market presently D.J.H.: If the
shares in a limited co. are fully-paid the holder
cannot be legally called upon for more; if
they are not, he is liable for the difference
between the amount paid and the face value.
B.N.Z.: If the shares were bought before
the dividend was declared, it belongs to the
buyer, though he may not have transferred the
scrip in time to receive it J.L.S.: (1) Cannot
say; they have not an open market. (2) They
are a long-term speculation; the prospectus
estimate is rough guesswork. (3) and (4)
According to the prospectus, about 12 years
and 20 years respectively. (5) As sawn timber
chief market has thus far been for boxes,
crates and rough and temporary structural pur-
poses. The wood is being used to a limited
extent for houses and outbuildings, chiefly in
rural areas; it has yet to win a wide market in
this respect E.G.Y.T.: About 10s. The div.
is four years in arrears, but the co.’s prospects
have brightened considerably during the last
six months.


SHADOW SHOWS
In “No Marriage Ties,” at the Regent,
another American scandal is butchered
to make a film-fan’s holiday. Stunt
advertising, to wit. Richard Dix gets
drunk in a bar when he should be report-
ing a prize fight for his newspaper, and
is sacked. So he starts a publicity busi-
ness with Allan Dinehart, one of the
employees being Elizabeth Allan, who
gave him the glad eye in the bar and
helped him home afterwards. He realises
the baseness of his occupation when the
fair owner of a beauty parlor, whom he
has made love to for business purposes,
and then abandoned, commits suicide.
Dix delivers a farewell to ballyhoo—the
sort of resounding commination service
which used to be good for a round of
applause at the end in the days of stage
melodrama—and retires to the bar
already mentioned, where he is presently
discovered drunk by Miss Allan. And
so he is weaned of his resolve not to
marry, and the two face life together up-
lifted spiritually and otherwise by their
experiences.
A silly story, and Dix doesn’t look
like a drunk when he is supposed to
be under the influence, or like a go-getter
when he is off the drink. First and last
he is just a stoutish, dressy beauty-man
who is too old and stolid for his boyish
part.
“Penthouse” is a well-cast gangster
with enough human blood to satisfy the
most morbid. It begins with the murder
of Mae Clarke. Phillips Holmes is sus-
pected. Warner Baxter, society man and
lawyer, accepts a brief for the defence,
and leads a search for the assassin, as is
the custom of members of the New York
Bar in talkies.
At this stage Myrna Loy comes into
his life. An associate of criminals and
women of ill fame, she is nevertheless
pure at heart, and love soon burgeons
between the eminent criminal defender
and the underworld queen in the Paris
frocks. She is largely responsible for
the solution of the mystery, which is
accompanied by a holocaust in which
most of her girlhood’s friends are exter-
minated.
Nat Pendleton is really good as a
genial young thug who, out of gratitude
for his latest acquittal, insists on supply-
ing Baxter with a bodyguard. Such
descendants of the old-time comic villains
who were accustomed to caper prepos-
terously in front of the snarling chief
malefactor in the last act indicate how
far the films have progressed in realism.
Pendleton’s crook is always credible, and
his violent death is about the most
naturalistic, and, consequently, revolt-
ing, spectacle of the sort that has been
shown on the screen. Charles Butter-
worth, Baxter’s low-comedy manservant,
is rather out of the homicidal yet re-
strained picture.
* * *
In “India Speaks,” at Melbourne Audi-
torium, Richard Halliburton supplies the
verbal accompaniment to a succession
of excellent scenic pictures he photo-
graphed in the Peninsula. Mr. Halli-
burton has various adventures amongst
the tombs, temples, palaces and ghats of
Mother India. He decides to penetrate
the mysteries of esoteric knowledge, and
seeks out a celebrated guru, but appa-
rently the sage’s discourse casts too
severe a strain on his mental muscle, for
in another hundred feet he is walking
beside the lakes of Kashmir playing
handies with a beautiful Indian maid
who has fallen for his well-tailored
figure.
Next Mr. H. intrudes into a great
mosque at Ramadan disguised as a
Moslem, and when the profanation is
discovered is chased off the premises by
an infuriated mob of the faithful. He
encounters a python, treads on an alli-
gator and meets a bat. Previous to this
encounter the bat was, like Bernard
Shaw, a convinced vegetarian, but the
sight of the well-nourished Mr. Halli-
burton turned it into a deadly vampire.
Mr. Halliburton recovers from a blood-
transfusion operation and hears of a
mysterious Russian girl who lies at the
mercy of Tibetan lamas in a lamasery.
It is proposed to marry her to the
Buddha who will make her the mother
of a living god, and at great risk of
frostbite Mr. Halliburton crosses the
snowbound passes of the Himalayas to
save the lady’s virtue. The lady refuses
to have her virtue saved by Mr. Halli-
burton. This is the only touch of humor
in the production, and is probably un-
conscious.
In “India Speaks” India doesn’t
speak. America speaks, with and to the
mind of the movie-educated proletariat
of America. The trumpeting of an ele-
phant is a philosophic interlude com-
pared to the farrago of nonsense that
pours from the lips of Mr. Halliburton.
There is an amiably silly comedy on the
programme and a gangster film in which
some hill-billies, with the customary
reluctance to seek the assistance of the
police, go to the top of a lofty mountain
and clean up a nest of outlaws. The
highlight of the opus occurs when the
master crook uses the beautiful heroine
as a shield and is shot through the heart
and over her shoulder by Deadshot Jim,
the hero.

This is Baby Week at Sydney Capitol.
In “Walls of Gold” (Fox) Sally Eilers, as
Jean Satterlee, is the proprietor of an
employment agency so successful and
prosperous that it takes her all her time
to attend to several telephones and tell
architects and swell guys like that
whether they can or cannot have a job.
Norman Foster, as the nephew of a steel
millionaire (Ralph Morgan), meets Sally.
Norman has the raucous accent of the
Bowery but considers women should be
pure. He’s in uncle’s business, and runs
to a roadster that looks like 4000 bucks.
Sally falls for him, but wicked uncle
tempts her and she falls —to the extent of
Centre : Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge in “Falling for You” at
Sydney Lyceum.
acce Pti n g a fur coat that looks like 6000
i ro n men. Nothing more than that, but
more than enough for the college lad
Wl th the Bowery twang. He gets full of
hooch and marries the employment
agency lady’s little sister, who previously
had T been seduced by the millionaire
uncle.
tt So S , a y marnes millionaire uncle,
He could get her no other way. She
speedily finds that her husband is a rake,
though old enough to be her grandfather,
and he forbids her to have children. So
she adopts the babe of the sister who
married her husband’s nephew and (very
conveniently) died in childbirth. Steel
milll onaire casts Sally forth on this ac-
count, and when nephew comes back
Soath America, where he has been
mining (presumably for steel), he finds
her playing mother to his offspring.
There is three-quarters of an hour more
of it after this, but it leads to the usual
fade-out. For adults only, but Mr.
O’Reilly needn’t have worried.
“The Wrecker” (Columbia), on the
same bill, also features an infant, but it
tells a better story and dresses it more
picturesquely. Jack Holt, as Regan, in
the building-wrecking business, is a big-
hearted, red-blooded he-man who attains
to the commercial eminence denoted by
the control of multifarious telephones
and marries his sweetheart Mary
(Genevieve Tobin). Incidentally, he be-
friends Shapiro, an Italian salvager
(George E. Stone), and Cummings, a
building contractor (Sidney Blackmer).
Cummings wrecks Regan’s home, and,
rather than make trouble, the chivalrous
Regan disappears, leaving the way free
for his wife to get a divorce and marry
Cummings, the lady retaining also cus-
tody of the child. Regan disappears for
three years, devoting himself to booze,
but reappears when Cummings and Mary
are pinned under the earthquaked ruins
of a jerry-built school (jerry-building by
Cummings). They can be saved only
by the scientific wrecking of the mass
of girders above their place of imprison-
ment.
Regan intends to kill them when
his oxy-acetylene blowpipe has severed
the last girder, but Shapiro climbs up and
tells him to be moral. So Regan relents,
but another earthquake shock kills the
guilty pair and Regan gets his kid back.
Splendid shots of skyscraper wrecking ;
f.a.q. study of Italian sentiment by Stone,
and some really fine acting by Holt, who
seems at last to have struck an intelligent
director.
Sundry Shows
The Bulletin attended, as in duty
bound, the last melancholy rites attend-
ing the funeral of the Royal in Mel-
bourne. The sad event occurred on Fri-
day. Theatres must die some time like
human beings, and the Royal had along
innings— seventy-odd years of it in its
later incarnation, and it had a previous
existence before that. The house was
fuff of oidtimers trying to look as if they
had remained loyal all their lives to their
old playmate and had never been to a
talkie. Giants of the past, like old Slap-
poffski, drifted ghostlike about the
foyers. Charles Wenman and Phil
Finkelstein recalled the fact that they
were the only survivors of the amalgama-
tion 21 years ago of the forces of baronet
Rupert Clarke, John Wren, Meynell and
Gunn with the Williamson firm. The
obsequies concluded with tableaux in
which contemporary histrions appeared
as Nellie Stewart, Dame Melba, George
Lauri, George Rignold, Maggie Moo?e
(Lizzie Stofel), Julius Knight, Wilson
Barrett, Tittell Brune (L’Aiglon) and
others. Marion Marcus Clarke appeared
as her own mother, Ronald Atholwood
as his dad, J. 8., and Meta Pelham, the
oldest actress in Victoria, in her own
role of Mrs. Cody in “Dear Brutus”
The last rites fittingly included a per-
formance of J.C.W.’s record-breaker,
“The Maid of the Mountains.” Gladys
Moncrieff sang “Love Will Find a Way”
and repeated the slight ditty umpteen
times, to insistent public demand. She
blew kisses to Arthur Stigant, and he
blew her kisses ; and then she blew kisses
to everyone. Strong women wept and
strong men blew their noses. Ten hours
later the wreckers removed the d.c. seat
which had been warmed by Bulletin
critics for a half-century and put it in a
lorry.

Clara Butt’s opening recital at Sydney
Town Hall attracted the usual big audi-
ence, though the night was a dirty one.
The singer, who is still feeling the effects
of an accidental injury received some
years ago and sits while declaiming all
save a very few of her numbers, has still
probably the finest contralto voice in the
world, and her lower register retains the
organ-like quality which made her fam-
ous. Her enunciation is as clear as ever.
As is the nature of great artists, she con-
tinues to learn, and one of the important
things she has learned in recent years is
not to tie herself to a set programme, but
to make selections from her extensive
repertoire on the spur of the moment.
Her choice on Saturday night ranged
over Gluck, Brahms, Schubert (“Death
and the Maiden”) and Schumann, and
included a magnificently impressive ren-
dition of Cesar Franck’s “Panis Angeli-
cas,” with organ, ’cello and violin accom-
paniment. Dame Clara has added to her
lingual achievements an ability to sing
in Japanese, and warbled “Chinkoro-
Koinu,” which is a song about a little
dog. May Brahe’s “Down Here” was the
only item by an Australian composer.
The much-advertised “The Company of
Heaven,” Maurice Besley’s setting of a
poem by Whittier, proved disappointing.
The audience was invited to join in part
of the refrain, but found the phrasing
difficult to memorise.
For some of Dame Clara’s songs in
the first half of the recital Ernest Tru-
man accompanied on the organ, but
something went wrong with the works
at about nine o’clock, and Raymond
Lambert gave pianoforte backgrounds.
Lambert, ’cellist David Sisserman and
violinist Philip Cohen played the Brahms
C Minor Trio charmingly, and solo con-
tributions by these three instrumentalists
filled in the intervals between Dame
Clara’s appearances.

The characters assembled by Rodney
Ackland in his play, “Strange Orchestra,”
presented by the Independents at Sydney
Savoy on Saturday, are mostly neurotics,
and the play is of the sort G.B.S. would
label “unpleasant.” A lot of the dialogue
is pointless. The author’s aim appears
to be to have a fling at the educated
larrikin. Acting honors were scored by
Marie Rosenfeld, Freda McGhee, Mar-
guerite Shirlaw and Jean Elwing. James
Pratt and John Wyndham were the best
of the men. Doris Fitton produced.

A small audience at Sydney Con. list-
ened to a violin recital by Dan Scully,
pupil of Cyril Monk. The young man
gave a fine performance of the Franck
Sonata (with Frank Hutchens at the
piano) and surmounted the formidable
technical difficulties of the Bach G
Minor Sonata (unaccompanied) with
ease, demonstrating his versatility in
characteristic excerpts from Gluck,
Chaminade, Debussy and Falla, all in-
fused with life. If Mr. Scully were
popped on the Town Hall platform as
Senor Palpitotszky, of Buda-Pesth, the
idol of six continents, musical Sydney
would crowd the place to the doors and
wear out its hands applauding his genius.
He is a master of the mechanics of his
instrument, his musical instinct is sound
and he mingles affection and reverence
in his playing.
* * *
A packed Town Hall and an unnum-
bered horde of listeners throughout
Victoria, except for the blind spots,
hearkened to the first full symphony con-
cert under the new alliance between the
University orchestrions and the profes-
sional entourage of the Broadcasting
Commission, violinist Tossy Spivakovsky
flying from Adelaide to play the solo
role in the Tschaikowsky concerto. If
a former generation had been told that
such things could be, they would have
refused to believe it. If the part played
by the human performers was not in the
same order of efficiency as that played
by the electricians, the difference was
barely perceptible, and in the case of the
concerto wasn’t perceptible at all. Fiddler
Tossy made a miracle of loveliness out
of the Russian composer’s opus, and
followed the achievement with an exqui-
site Bach fugue unaccompanied. The
“Pastoral Symphony” of Beethoven was
an appropriate selection, in view of the
fact that listeners in the Mallee, Gipps-
land, the Bogong High Plains and the
Western District were being catered for.

ABORIGINALITIES
“F.H.S.”: An old grey mare I once
owned was the shrewdest thing I have
ever come across, not overlooking Syd-
ney barrowmen. I was out cutting
timber for a fence, and carelessly left
her in the sulky without locking the
wheels, thinking she would be quite con-
tent, as she had her young foal with her ;
being lame, he could not move about
much. A falling tree must have startled
her, for she took off and I lost
her in the failing light. Next morning I
was up bright and early, and was amazed
to find her at the stable door with the
foal standing in the sulky. How she
persuaded her offspring to save the pain-
ful walk home by clambering into the
sulky I can’t even guess.
* * * *
“Imaun”: What “Searchlight” saw
when the lady mantis bit her spouse in
two (B. 8/11 /’33) was not a family
quarrel but the end of the honeymoon.
Mrs. Mantis, like most of the spiders, the
“And how is Bobbie?”
“’E ain’t Bobbie —’ees name’s Robert. Ain’t it, Bob?"
scorpions and innumerable other mem-
bers of that teeming world we casually
refer to as “insect,” not only murders
her husband as soon as the nuptial rite
has been completed, but eats him to
round off the ceremony. The race of
homo sapiens is not clear of similar re-
grettable practices. Tamara, that great
Georgian empress, goes down in history
as one who smiled on a new lover each
day, but saw to it that he did not live to
the next dawn to tell his experience. In
a later day, Catherine of Russia
obliterated her fleeting fancies in much
the same forthright fashion.
* * * *
“Amity”: A relative of ours brought
to civilisation his four-year-old son, who,
used entirely to native playmates in his
home in the Islands, spoke practically no
English, but chatted volubly in the native
language. This amazed his Sydney girl-
cousin of his own age, who had never
heard anyone speak in a foreign tongue,
and stood by in silent awe while the lad
talked with his father. Suddenly the
boy laughed aloud. An expression of
intense relief came into the little lassie’s
face. “Anyway, he can laugh English,”
she said.
* * * *
“Kismet”: The Samoan missionary’s
wife was sent to the Island hospital.
Twelve hours later she died. The
widower asked if she might be left in
the ward, as there were no other patients
there. This was permitted. Doing
rounds that evening, a sight that I can
never forget met my eyes. On the floor
in the centre of the ward, laid out on a
linen sheet, was the corpse, clad in bridal
garb—white satin gown and shoes and
orange-blossom garland over the lace
veil. Even the white kid gloves were
there. Against the dark-brown skin the
contrast was pathetic. The widower,
however, seemed to be enjoying himself.
On my arrival he acted as a sort of show-
man and laughed loudly as he expatiated
on the good quality of the materials.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: Going snapper-fishing
out from Coff’s Harbor (N.S.W.), we
anchored and called for bait. It had
been left behind. “Got any soap?” de-
manded our resourceful captain. A bar
was discovered, and we baited with small
chunks from it. A few minutes later one
of our party landed a 121 b. baby shark.
Shark makes excellent snapper bait, and
we finished the day with a great catch.
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale”: Architectural doyen
of the mud-building wasps is the Cape
York spider-hunter, a curmudgeonly
fellow whose short, sharp dagger has left
mementoes on many whites and blacks
in lumps as big as a pullet egg and scarlet
as the midnight Cray. Its residence is a
domed palace of many rooms, each with
its special purpose, and built entirely by
the male, immediately following engage-
ment to be married. The base chap likes
taking his girl into dark places, and
always selects a site heavily screened by
thick scrub or overhanging rock. The
morning after marriage the happy couple
go out spider-sleuthing. They paralyse
the quarry by a thrust through the higher
nerve centres at the back of the neck.
Having gorged, they continue the hunt,
taking the excess to the nursery. There
the lady lays an egg on it, the male walls
it off with mud and leaves it to the
agencies of heat and time, and they carry
on the process till a heftier male takes a
fancy to the missus, murders the husband
and carts her off to another dark spot to
start another family—a frequent occur-
rence. The abos. dread this wasp more
than any other winged thing, and keep
a wary eye for the black, yellow-striped
inch-long body in its catapulting ferocity,
“In another three months I’ll be darning your socks, Dave, darling.”
“Don’t want to worry about that. I c’n knock ’em off once we’re marri’d.”
“Deah Me”: Who teaches the Hawkes-
bury College students to shear? A photo-
graph in the “S. M. Herald” depicts one
of them going down the “whipping side,”
holding the jumbuck’s head between his
legs. If there is one way more calculated
than another to make a sheep struggle
and kick it is to straddle his neck. It
simply is not done by a decent “greasy.”
* * * *
“Jimmy the Swallower”: As one who
has followed the old track down the right
bank of the Balonne from St. George
to Angledool and then back again on
the other side let me tell “W.P.T.” (B.
8/11/’33) that billy-boiling contests are
no new thing. He is evidently a mug at
the game or else he would have pointed
out that the older the billy the quicker she
boils. A new hand just come on the
wallaby with a new billy would have
about as much chance among the heads
as Bert Stevens would have of being
elected president of the Seamen’s Union.
Old dogs like myself carry billies burned
to tissue-paper thinness and keep them
carefully packed in calico overcoats. A
billy of the sort I and some of my mates
''arry will boil, given a decent fire, in a
couple of minutes. The six minutes men-
tioned by “W.P.T.” as his champion’s
performance makes me laugh. Of course,
there’s a catch in it. There’s always some
dirty cow who tries surreptitiously to
stiffen a champion billy by sticking his
knife or a bit of fencing-wire through the
bottom.
* * * *
“Strut”: While flying recently I
noticed three brolgas high up against the
sun, and out of curiosity went up to find
out just what height they were circling
at. After some minutes’ climbing the
’plane levelled off just above the birds,
with the altimeter showing a little over
8000 ft. They had been circling, ap-
parently aimlessly, for hours over the
same country. I used to think hawks
were the highest-flying birds, but the
long-legged fellows beat them hollow.
Pelicans and flamingoes ascend to great
heights, but I doubt if they ever attain
such altitudes as do the brolgas. Those
fellows took no notice whatever of my
’plane.
* * * *
“FY7”: As to abo. letter sticks (B.
8/11 /’33), the late Dr. Roth, who woke
up the world of ethnology and anthro-
pology by his famous study of the far-
western Queensland natives when he was
a resident surgeon at remote Boulia, has
fairly well settled the question as far as
that part of the world is concerned,
Boulia was the great centre of what we
would nowadays call the native drug
trade. The drug was pituri —a sedative in
demand far to the east and south. To the
north-west natives from all over Queens-
land came messengers eager to buy the
precious plant. They brought articles to
pay for it, mostly ochres and similar
methods of adornment which the sellers
could not command themselves. In the
days when to leave one’s own “towri”
meant swift extinction, these ambassadors
of commerce would have to traverse a
hundred hostile territories. If Roth is nor
wrong the letter stick was their passport.
'M Jfc *
“Raeakiaki”: “Pakeha” is certainly
derived from Pakehakaha (B. 8/11/ ’33),
but it isn’t of Polynesian origin, save in
the sense that Maori may be considered
a Polynesian dialect. Anyhow, “O’L.”
misses the point. Pakehakaha denotes a
white race, reputed to be sea-gods, rather
than fair-skinned fairies, who were more
usually termed Turehu or Patu-pae-
arehe. It was the fact that the white
man came from the sea that got him the
monicker of pakeha ; he was regarded
as belonging to the race of sea-gods.
Had he come from the woods he might
to-day be called Korako (albino) or some
abbreviation of Patu-pae-arehe. Before
pakeha came into settled use, the Maori
referred to the white man as tangata
pora (ship-man) and matai (from the
sea), which amply substantiates the idea
underlying the application of the term
“pakeha.”
* * * *
“B.”: Many an exiled monarch must
sigh for loyalty such as this. In Marianas
(Argentina) a dog killed the queen of a
swarm of bees. The swarm stung the
offender to death and then went berserk,
attacking and killing a foxy, two grey-
hounds and some other tripehounds.
With no more dogs to conquer, the be-
reaved tribe flew to the nearest water
and drowned themselves.
**- * *
“Sling th’ Bhat”: I have to shake my
head over the contention (B. 8/11/’33)
that a Belgian youngster of eight years
who had spent the last five of them in
Scotland could not, on his return to his
native land, understand the speech of his
people. A child of three years old is
sealed irrevocably to the language he
learned in babyhood. European children
born in India have to be sent home when
three or four years old, to remain there
until manhood. These invariably learn
from their native nurses the language of
their section of India—usually Urdu, the
lingua franca of Hind —which they speak
much more fluently than the tongue of
their parents. It is a commonplace that
a few days after their return to India the
tongue they learned in the cradle comes
back with all its old fluency.
HOPEFUL.

The time before, I just missed second prize,
A thousand lovely quid in one big lick!
And me sixteen away—l nearly cries.
Well, that’s another dollar up the spout;
For rotten spins I reckon I’m a freak.
I tell you, Mrs. Gubb, my luck’s dead out
They draw another lottery next week.
The numbers I get stuck with always lose:
I might as well be picking ’em with pins.
That useless loafer Bert’s back on the booze,
And Ada’s got the mumps, and Lil’s got
twins.
She never had no commonsense, that Lil;
Why did she marry that side-whiskered sheik?
He’ll never leave the dole, I say....but, still,
They draw another lottery next week.
I've got them pains again, and worse this time —
1 reckon I could work here till 1 drop
For all that Bert would care and it’s a
crime
They way they’ve blocked our credit at the
shop.
But for the cash-and-carry, I’d despair;
You must admit the prospect’s pretty bleak
With all that hungry tribe to feed... .but, there,
They draw another lottery next week.
Dad’s teeth, the doctor says, must come away,
The blessed lot—l’ll bet he’ll look a fright.
I dunno how he think’s he going to pay
And still get down his skinful ev’ry night.
Old Bodger says the rent is months behind,
And wants a settlement —it’s like his cheek
To ask us for it n0w.... But never mind!
They draw another lottery next week.

“Chevroford”: Periodically Gippsland
is terrorised by a reputed wolf, tiger,
bear, leopard or panther which turns out
later to be a somewhat large dog. The
apparition which smote the eyes of a
Melbourne lady motorist the other day
requires more than the usual explana-
tion, however. Turning a bend she saw
an elephant browsing off gumtips in a
paddock. She rubbed her eyes and looked
again, but the animal was still there.
There is no circus in the vicinity and
Wirth’s haven’t lost anything as big and
not noticed it. There is also no question
about the lady’s sobriety.
* * * *
“Porosus”: There is no particular rea-
son to wonder about the contents of the
crocodile described by “C. Coral” (B.
8/11/ ’33). He talks of one oval-shaped
stone found in the brute’s stomach. Hav-
ing shot and dissected many crocodiles,
1 can aver that I am astonished at the
moderation of this particular croc. Not
one of the many 1 can recall but had
anything from a dozen to thirty or forty
large-sized pebbles inside him, all ground
into oval shape—every mining man who
has had to dp with a ball mill will realise
what this means. No one can give a satis-
factory explanation of why the crocodile
carries these stones habitually in his
tummy. He hardly needs them to grind
up his food, as a bird uses gravel in the
crop, since he lets his prey rot to de-
liquescence, almost, before he eats it.
Some claim that this is his object. Others
say that he takes it in for ballast to help
him sink, he being a slow and clumsy
swimmer, almost always on the surface
BOS'N : “Throw us up that rope you’re hangin' on to and I’ll have another shot
at launchin’ her.”
except when he does his feeding—invari-
ably carried out under water. My own
idea is that he uses the stones as dunnage,

whose abode was on the watersheds of
Jacqua and Nerramunga Creeks (N.S.W.).
Willoughby, a resident of the locality, had
seen this ’roo almost weekly on his pro-
perty from the time he was a boy until
he passed out at well-nigh 90. The ’roo
still carried on until a hunter’s gun ter-
minated the old chap’s innings. Judging
by the scars on his ears and his nippers,
almost worn to the gums, I’d say he was
an inmate of the ark.

“C. Coral”: In the Diocesan Museum
at Samarai is a piece of native workman-
ship which is probably the only thing
of its kind in the world —a battle-axe,
somewhat like the old Norman weapon
in shape, beautifully chipped from a fine
piece of obsidian which came from
Goodenough Island. The museum con-
tains a number of other unique relics,
many of which were collected by Bishop
Stone-Wigg, and which have caused
anthropologists a good deal of specula-
tion.
* * * *
“Soso”: Not all who find lost money
get as paltry a reward as “Nikko’s”
friend (B. 1/11/ ’33). At Wagga Wagga
(N.S.W.) while walking near the river I
found a fiver. Next morning’s paper con-
tained an advt. offering £2 for return
of the note. I ’phoned the loser,
an old bushman in town for a few days,
and he came to see me. From a roll like
a pint-pot he peeled off a couple of notes
and uttered profuse thanks, explaining
it wasn’t the fiver that mattered. There
was in his mind the unworthy suspicion
that his mate had nipped it while they
dozed under a tree on the river bank.
He had offered the reward to find out
the truth. Next morning an ad. appeared
in the paper, thanking me for returning
the money. About lunch time the old
chap brought along a few of his cobbers
to shake my mit and “meet an honest
man,” and he then handed me a little
packet—a reminder of the affair. It was
a pocket book, and the docket showed
it cost him 325. 6d. Three days later he
called again, and borrowed ten bob, his
fare back to Tarcutta and work.

“Hamer”: A Ryde (Sydney) cow (in
calf) was sent to a paddock at Liverpool
for a month ; when its calf was born it
was returned to Ryde, its offspring being
left behind. The cow escaped, and was
back at the Liverpool paddock in less
than 23 hours after its departure, having
apparently swum the Parramatta. Pre-
viously it had made the journey both
ways by motor-truck!
* * * *
“Selma”: Birds and small animals are
not the only creatures fascinated by
snakes. An aunt of ours, from England,
went into the yard to peg out some wash-
ing and encountered a brown snake. She
stood still with surprise and shock and
stared at the snake, which stared back.
Presently someone went out to speak to
auntie, who removed her eye for a
second from the crawler and then dis-
covered he had vanished. Asked why she
h ad not called someone to dispatch him.
auntie assured us she was incapable of
doing ,his ' being Possessed for the time
by “a queer sensation” which made
movement or speech impossible.

“Coolibah”: I wish I could get hold
of some of those chooks that are immune
to poison. Mine are decidedly other-
wise. My wife papered the kitchen and
to discourage silverfish and cockroaches
mixed a teaspoonful of white arsenic
with the paste. When the job was com-
pleted the basin in which the paste had
been mixed was handed to the lubra with
instructions to wash it thoroughly. Mary
filled it with water and left it standing in
the yard while she pursued a goanna.
Result, ten dead hens an hour later.
Recently 1 emptied the meat-cask, leav-
ing a quantity of coarse salt on the grass.
Twelve Black Orpingtons rushed in and
gobbled some, and all were dead next

day. On another occasion we emptied
and cleaned the dip, recovering from
the bottom hundreds of preserved cattle-
ticks. A party of foraging Muscovies
discovered these and died on the spot.

“L.D.G.”: “Jackeroo” is of South
American origin. The Guacho-lndian
for horseman or stationhand is “chac-
queroo.” The Guacho evidently got the
word from his former masters, the
Spaniards, for it is a corruption of
“vaquero,” which means “cowman.”
* * * *
“R.K.”: That savage Binghi had an
etiquette of hospitality is recorded by
Count de Strzelecki in a manuscript cher-
ished by the Mitchell Library. While ex-
ploring the Blue Mountains with
a friendly abo. as guide the Pole
and his companions on a night dark as
pitch, and in a deluge of rain, sighted a
campfire. The abo. went forward alone,
leaving the rest of the party shivering in
the scrub. After a thorough cross-
examination by the blacks seated round
the fire the ambassador was told that
his party would not be welcome in the
camp (this was about 1840, and the
abos. were getting full up of the white
man). But the emissary was not sent
away empty-handed. He took with him
a huge piece of hot roast kangaroo meat
on a platter of bark, and directions for
finding a dry cave close by. This cour-
tesy made a deep impression on De
Strzelecki, and he records his gratitude
and his admiration for the race that could
deal so generously with people they
reckoned as enemies and oppressors.
* * * *
“Raeakiaki”: The death of the Maori
king Te Rata and the coronation
of his son Koroki occurred just
after the 75th anniversary of the
election of the first king, that stout
old warrior-chief Potatau Te Whero-
whero. It was Tamehana Rauparaha, son
of the terrible Te Rauparaha, who con-
ceived the idea of uniting the tribes under
one king, but after his return from a
trip to England it took several years of
intensive propaganda to bring the scheme
to fruition. The Kingite leaders wanted to
see the tribes living amicably with one
another and with the pakehas, and hoped
to preserve the land, mana and national
independence of the Maoris. But these
objects were not achieved, and friction
between the white and brown races cul-
minated in the bitter Waikato war.
* * * *
“Frig.”: Apropos the King’s right to
sturgeon, it was Edward 11. who decided
that sturgeons caught in that part
of the Thames over which the Lord
Mayor has control should belong to the
Crown. Sturgeons are different from
ordinary fishes. Their skeletons are made
of gristle, and they have five rows of
bony plates along the backs and sides of
their bodies, like armor. They weigh up
to 4001 b., and run to Bft. in length.
Caviare consists of sturgeons’ eggs, salted
and put into barrels. The stuff that comes
from part of their swimming apparatus
has so much gelatine in it that if a little
of it is dissolved in a hundred times as
much water it will form a stiff jelly when
cold. As for the flavor of sturgeon flesh
—no wonder it was claimed as a King’s
monopoly!
In B. 27/9/’33 a contributor wrote of a
“literary lady who went up the Sepik
River, N.G when... .tribes were
head-hunting,” and, on the District Officer
boarding the vessel intent on bringing her
ashore, “retired to her cabin, disrobed,
and stoutly refused to move.” Miss
Beatrice Grimshaw, the novelist, writes
that “the paragraph will certainly be
identified as referring to myself, as there
is no other woman writer (at least, none
known to myself) who 1 has visited the
Sepik River.” This does not accord with
The Bulletin’s information, but Miss
Grimshaw’s account is express and, of
course, unquestionable.
I visited the Sepik River in 1923 in the launch
of the Catholic Mission, an invited and welcome
guest. The Government officers did everything
they could to assist me, and no one made the
slightest objection to my going anywhere I
wished.
The Bulletin confesses that it admired
the spirit of the lady of the paragraph,
and it, of course, had no intention of
offending Miss Grimshaw, for whom it
has a high respect.
* * * *
“Searchlight”: On the Barcoo the
other day a pair of foxes which had
been ravaging the station sheep were
tracked to an old coolibah tree, into the
foliage of which they disappeared. They
were discovered crouched in an eagles’
nest and were promptly dispatched. They
had evidently been in possession a con-
siderable time, for the nest was neatly
lined with fox fur. The body of the
vixen bore unmistakable signs of a battle
royal with the former owners, there being
gashes in her side ten inches long.
* * * *
“Dai R.”: Among some of the Centra-
lian tribes having a funeral is a tedious
business for the star, proceedings in some
instances lasting up to three years. The
preamble of dying is boring, too, and
many shrewdies when they hear the plash
of Charon’s paddles try to give the im-
pression that they’re just beginning to
enjoy life by bursting into ribald song
or simulating the mien of one who has
backed a Cup winner. They usually fail to
convince, and the pre-death rites of having
one’s mia-mia pulled down on one, being
lain upon and tickled, etc., have to be
gone through till in most cases ennui
drives the spirit from the body. In some
tribes the dying man is pummelled dur-
ing his last few hours by all available
relatives (especially mothers-in-law) to
shoo out devils who may have taken
lodgings in his kidneys. The funeral acts
are many and varied, with intervals of
one, two or three moons, and each re-
quires that the remains be removed to
fresh scenery, sometimes miles from the
last. In most tribes of the Centre 18
months is about the time it takes to get
buried, but among the Warramunga and
a few adjacents it often runs to 42 moons.
Clouded new moons are not counted.
NAVVYING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With banjo, pick and barrow
I toil, when rhyming fails,
In heat to melt one’s marrow
To build a road of rails.
And when to camps of canvas
The weary navvies stream
I’ve worked as any man has
And lay me down to dream
Of cool and restful regions
Beyond the farthest star,
With shady trees in legions
On beaches flung afar.
Here God will grant me leisure,
While combers curl and cream,
To take my well-earned pleasure
And rest, and rest and dream
A dreamer’s dream of dreaming
In one enchanted land
That, lily-white and gleaming,
The Great Boss holds in hand.
And through long, long and broad days
He’ll listen as serene
To rhymers of the roadways
As to rhymers of routine.
QUEENSLAND.

The World’s
Largest Car Makers Use
Australian Pyrox Plugs!
When Ford and General Motors use any one product
EXCLUSIVELY in all cars and trucks sold in Australia, you
know it MUST be good!
These manufacturers KNOW what they are doing—they
cannot afford to risk the reputation of their products by
fitting inferior equipment.
They KNOW what an important effect spark plugs have
upon speed, petrol economy, and reliability of operation.
The fact that they use Pyrox PROVES not only that these
plugs are good, but that they are also the best Australian
plugs.
Add to this endorsement the facts that Pyrox is also used by the
P.M.G.'s Department and the Victorian Railways, and that it is backed
by the great name of Bosch, and you’ll agree that Pyrox is the only
plug for you!

OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES.
“lnsultation,” or “ ‘Sun’ Stroke.” —This
complaint recently assumed epidemic pro-
portions at Canberra. The patient de-
velops an acute sense of oppression.
Some early symptoms are an inordinate

criticism. The attack, which follows a
rise in temperature of £75, is character-
ised by splenetic outbursts and a general

comes intensified after an election. An
unusual effect is its reflex action, the
electors being the chief sufferers.
“Cranial Ossification.” —This morbid
condition is due to a lesion when the
microscopic portion of grey matter solidi-
fies. It need in no way interfere with
the patient’s means of livelihood ; in fact,
more often than not it is essential to
success in his job. Many union secre-
taries and Empire celebrations organisers
suffer from it. It is known colloquially
as “Boneheadedness.”

A.D. 1983.
The Sydney tourists had arrived by
rocket at Canberra Ruins in the sched-
uled time, 53 3-ssec.
Shudderingly they fol-
lowed their robot guide.
An eerie silence hung
over the place like a pall.
Strange creatures of the
undergrowth fled before
them in terror.
“A descendant of George
Reid’s Dry Dog,” creaked
the robot as an animal
like a debilitated rat took
refuge in what had once
been a palatial kennel.
“The kennel was built by
an ancestor of the present
Lord Bruce of Mayfair.”
Suddenly the party
halted, ashen-faced.
In a dark and crumbling chamber,
made hideous with myriad bats, hanging
cobwebs, hooting owls and croaking
toads, sat an incredibly old man before
a worm-eaten table. He was surrounded
by musty documents. The ancient dod-
dered to his feet wheezing hideously.
“On behalf of Parliament,” he began,
“I, Senator Pearce, welcome”
But the tourists had fled shrieking
from the ill-omened spot.

WHY I PUBLISH “BLITHER’S
WEEKLY.”
It irks me to see so many young Aus-
tralians idling their time away when they
could all be making fortunes.
I should never have become possessed
of my vast commercial interests had I
been content to go on polishing forks
and spoons and fetching utensils for
passengers to be sick in.
Neither would the staff of “Blither’s
Weekly” have been rescued from the
chains and slavery of capitalist journalism
—to such purpose, believe me, that even
my lowliest boy-reporter lights his Murias
with banknotes. And the ship of State
would now be staggering helplessly in
all directions instead of sailing, as you
see it, on an even keel, steered by the
steady hand and unfaltering purpose of
“Blither’s.” And that reminds me. Hold
on a minute, boys, while I ring up my
editor.
Hullo. That you? What’s our
policy this week ? What’s that ? Billy,
now —is he the Little Digger or the Lost
Leader? And Lyons? Honest Joe or
the Gramophone of the Baillieu
Group ? Earle Page, too. Super-
cilious Sawbones or the Seer of Graf-
ton ? Toss a coin, will you ? All right,
but don’t you ring-in any double-
header.
As I was saying, Aussies, you ought
to be making punches instead of hanging
round waiting for the dole. How are you
to set about it? Easy! Go along to

the Commonwealth Bank, all of you, and
see my worthy friend Mr. Griddle.
Tickle him with a tale and he’ll laugh at
you with an overdraft. That’s what
banks are for.
The overdraft secured, invest every
penny in our free lottery syndicate and
collar all the prizes. Or, if you prefer a
longer run for the bank’s money, go into
the great pony-flogging industry with
your head down. Get a galloway and
win a trot of races with it. When you
have no further use for the animal and
can’t find a buyer, follow a sound com-
mercial maxim—scrap the obsolete
machine. In other words, cut its throat.
Remember, this is a Land of Oppor-
tunity, so be wise in time.

WHO’LL BUY MY PRIMARIES?
(From Boodling’s “Street Cries of Old
Macquarie.”)
Who’ll buy my primaries, strong-scented
primaries,
Sixty pounds each, or a hundred the two ?
Oh, the dear luck-bringers!
Oh, the career-swingers !
Now then, you statesmen ! I’m looking
at you.
Primaries! Primaries! Fragrant as

Sixty pounds each ; only two are unsold.
Who wants a primary,
Smelling like rosemary ?
Out with your cheque-books, you patriots

All through Macquarie-street surges the
carol sweet :

Knows “The Pasty” took the cake.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
All the Cups at the spring meetings in
Victoria went to locally-trained horses:
Caulfield (Gaine Carrington), Moonee
Valley (Peter Jackson), Melbourne (Hall
Mark) and Williamstown (Shadow King).
In the ’eighties Commotion, Trenton and
Silvermine each ran third in a Melbourne
Cup and finished second a year later.
Shadow King has had five outings in the
big Cup for two thirds, two seconds and
once unplaced. Shadow King has also
made five attempts to carry off the Wil-
liamstown Cup. On Saturday the ambi-
tion of his owners was achieved, and
spectators went wild with delight when
the eight-year-old son of Comedy King
was brought back to scale by Breasley.
Shadow King was far from being
favorite; he started at 12 to 1 in the
ring and paid over 15 to 1 on the tote.
The short-priced candidates were Topical
and Regal Son, from Sydney. None of
the others was at less than 10 to 1. Many
punters declared that they would have
supported Shadow King had the day
been fine ; yet Topical had 41b. more to
carry than Shadow King and the Metrop.
winner only 31b. less. Kelso had Nord, as
well as Topical, to depend on. Nord is
his own property and finished second in
the last Sydney Cup. He has not shown
any liking for Melbourne courses, and
was allowed to go out at 25 to 1 at Wil-
liamstown ; he whipped-in the field. Nord,

a half-brother to. Statesman, is capable
of better things.
There is no excuse for the failure of
Topical. Undoubtedly this son of Wind-
bag would have won the Melbourne Cup
with a clear passage over the last furlong,
but at Williamstown everything went his
way. He jumped off smartly, was fourth
passing the stand and third at the nine-
furlongs post. McCarten subsequently
stated that Topical was well beaten a
long way from home. He responded
feebly when called upon near the turn
into the straight. The effort of Shadow
King was in marked contrast. Failing
to find an opening on the rails, Breasley
took him to the outside of the leaders,
smothered L’Elite and Ruach after enter-
ing the straight and went on to score by
a length from Pretzel, who came with a
lightning rush to defeat Greenhorn by a
head for second place. The course had
been drenched with showers, and Shadow
King did well to cover the mile and a
half in 2.32}. The course record is 2.30},
established by Yarramba in the Williams-
town Cup last year.
In a commendable spirit of enterprise
the Williamstown club installed a valu-
able juvenile race on its Cup programme
this year. This event, named the Rawdon
Stakes and worth £BOO, is run at set
weights, with penalties and allowances.
Nominations, taken on the first Tuesday
in June, totalled 225, but only 10 young-
sters went to the post. Aztec, who ran
Pasha to a neck in the Maribyrnong
Plate, was able to claim 71b. allowance,
and thus met Pasha on 171 b. better terms.
Naturally he went out a hot favorite, but
it was by only half a head that the
Thracian colt stalled off a late challenge
from Arachne, who is trained by J.
Donohoe for Norman Robinson, a Mel-
bourne sportsman. There were un-
founded rumors that Donohoe intended
to settle in the Victorian capital. He will,
however, remain there for a while.
R. Cook, a brother to W. Cook,
rode Arachne, who was backed for a
lot of money at long odds. If young
Cook had been able to exert the vigor
which Jack Daniels displayed on Aztec,
the favorite must have lost. As it was
the spectators reckoned that Arachne had
won, and they loudly dissented from the
judge’s half-head decision. Aztec’s sire
is a brother to Heroic, but, beyond run-
ning second to Rampion in the Vic.
Derby of 1926, he did nothing to justify
the relationship.
Royal Banquet’s victory in the Steeple-
chasers’ Flat illustrates the lottery of
horse-breeding. This gelding is a brother
to Royal Feast, who, when owned by
W. E. J. Craig, carried everything before
him as a two-year-old, winning £13,119
in stakes. Kellow paid a big price for
Royal Banquet, but did no good with
him as a galloper and gave him to C.
Brown, the present owner-trainer. Royal
Banquet has been a moderate performer
over fences.
* * * *
Dr. T. S. Kirkland, who raced Sunlit
Reef, was a lucky buyer at the last Syd-
ney sales. He got Rossinver for 220
guineas and Short Wave for 120. Rossin-
ver won at Moorefield at 15 to 1, and on
Saturday Short Wave annexed the first
division of the youngsters’ race at Rose-
hill at 10 to 1, beating a warm favorite,
The Black Cat. Short Wave is a fine type
of colt by the Tracery horse Marconi-
gram from the imported mare All Smiles,
who traces back to Touchstone.
Rosehill trainer Booth saddled up
Caravel Girl, Memento and Pavarti in
the second division. There was a great
battle for favoritism between Haut Cceur
and Caravel Girl, and 20 to 1 was on
offer about the remainder. When Caravel
Girl shook off Haut Cceur at the Leger
it looked any odds on O’Sullivan’s mount
winning; however, Memento, finishing
brilliantly, beat Haut Cceur cleverly, with
Caravel Girl, who tired right on the post,
a good third. Memento was bred by
Booth, and is a speedy-looking filly by
Treclare, who died last week, from a
Chrysolaus mare, Merrina ; he is related
to that good performer Sir Merriwee.
Dominion-bred Chiefava, sister to Miss
Nottava and Gesture, has at last lived
up to her track work. She won the first
division of the Maiden after a good battle
up the straight with Silvius King and
Lady Linbul. She started at tens owing
to the demand for Australian Bride, who
could only run fourth. The second divi-
sion went to Glory Girl (3 to 1); she just
struggled home from Bechuana and
Lingo, who ran a dead-heat.
Legislator is proving a goldmine for
Warwick Farm trainer I. H. Andrews.
This Page, which picked the Legionnaire
gelding for the Clyde Handicap, was
astonished at the price—10 to 1. Rivoli’s
mentor has now won three races with
Legislator. Tatyoon was made favorite,
but could only run a poor third ; Legis-
lator put in his customary strong finish.
Horses for courses. Ephialtes (4 to
1) had a runaway win at Rosehill about
eight months ago, and he repeated that
performance in the November Handicap,
scoring with ease from Safari and
Cymore. Pantilla and Bawn-na-Glas lost
their riders at the five furlongs ; still, on
the day it would have taken a good horse
to beat the son of Thomond, who was
turned out in capital trim by Rudd.
Royal Tune, now 11 years old, may
have reached the first class had he been
sound. He was third to Amounis in the
Epsom of 1928. His owner-trainer, S. J.
Gallegos, sent him to the post for the
Rydalmere Mile in capital trim, and,
starting at 7 to 1, the old fellow beat an
even-money favorite, Zeus, with Ena-
mour in the minor placing.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Walter Browning is usually too rough
for opponents who wrestle him at Leich-
hardt. He found Beth rougher than him-
self when they brawled on Saturday.
After Beth had gained a fall with a stand-
ing overarm headlock in the second
round, rules were disregarded. Beth sub-
mitted to a Boston crab in the fourth,
but with a perfectly placed right-cross
to the chin he knocked Browning out in
the fifth and dived on him for the decid-
ing fall.
Ins and Outs
The Board of Control is riding blindly
for a fall. When the M.C.C. gave a
gentleman’s assurance that there would
be no need to bother about the bodyline
question in future Tests, every person in
Australia outside the board accepted that
as ending the trouble, and the same was
the case with the English cricket public.
But, to the amazement of everyone, an-
other asinine cable has been dispatched
practically reiterating the insolent de-
mand for a definite undertaking. The
supposition that the M.C.C., which had
held out the olive branch, would stultify
itself by condemning its own players and
their captain is one worthy of the con-
cern that sent that cablegram from
Adelaide.
Blackie and Ironmonger had bad luck
for their benefit match in Melbourne,
rain preventing play on the Friday and
cutting off proceedings at 3 p.m. on
Saturday. Richardson’s side batted first,
and had dropped 2 for 160 when stumps
were drawn. Richardson was run out
for an attractive 28, and Bradman was
caught by Woodfull off Wall for a
streaky 55. On Monday it was 4 for 321,
Fingleton having got a century.
* * * * ,
“Lond.”: Does Australia remember
Quaife, the Warwickshire pro. who was
so artistic, though slow, in Test matches
30 years ago? (One cartoonist repre-
sented him as saying “Don’t bowl fast;
I am very little.”) He is still playing in
good club matches, and has, at the age
of 61, just made 93 and 105. His son
plays for Worcestershire.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: The opening round of
the Sheffield season saw a race between
Ironmonger and Grimmett to top the
300-wicket mark in first-class cricket for
their States. Grimmett reached 296 with
a bag of seven in his first try, but could
not get another during the match. Iron-
monger grabbed his chance, however,
and reached the coveted figures. This
is a record for the Cabbage Garden,
Jack Saunders, with 264, being next on
the list.
(Continued on next page.)
Racquet and Bawl
The Australian tennis team to meet
the Englishmen in the first Test which
begins in Sydney on November 30 is:
Crawford, Hopman, McGrath and Quist,
with Turnbull as emergency. Doubles
pairs will be Crawford-McGrath and
Hopman-Quist.
* * * 4=
“Centre Court”: One result of the
eliminating play.for the next Davis Cup
is that the opening rounds will be con-
tested much later —in June instead of
May, as previously. Of the 17 European
nations entering, Italy, Switzerland, Aus-
tria and Germany were the successful
four. With France and Czecho-Slovakia
—the latter as a semi-finalist this year—
these will be the only Europeans com-
peting for the right to challenge England.
The entries will be increased from out-
side Europe, Australia being almost a
certainty. Japan is going to the American
zone for next year.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: Those who saw Hopman
in action during the N.S.W. champion-
ships wished fervently he could have seen
his way to go to Europe with the last
Davis Cup team. Teamed with Craw-
ford in the doubles, this fine player would
have practically clinched our chances in
the Davis Cup doubles—admittedly the
doubles combinations were the team’s
weak link. He is playing with Crawford
in the Victorian championships, which
began early in the week, and their form
against Hughes and Perry will carry a
lot of interest for Australian tennis fol-
lowers.
>K * * *
“Fair Go”: In spite of that French
charge against American tennis-player
Lott of being a braggart (B. 8/11/’33) it
must be said he has some excuse for
chucking a chest. He has proved him-
self one of the best doubles players the
tennis world has seen. He won the
American doubles four times and with
three different partners. His record is
beaten only by Tilden, who, also with
three different helps, scored five victories.
* * * *
“Milton”: Gar Moon, the Queensland
Davis Cup representative of other days,
has disappointed his local admirers by
declining to go to Melbourne for the Vic-
torian championships. A pity, for he has
been showing his best form lately and
Crawford wanted to pair with him in
the doubles if he was available. When
the Americans were leaving after their
Australian tour, all of them expressed
astonishment that the Queenslander had
been omitted from the Davis Cup team,
as they ranked him the best of the Aus-
tralian doubles players. However, he
will appear in Sydney during the Austra-
lian championships in January.
* * * *
“Baseline”: The controversy over the
suggestion to cut the service in tennis
from two, as at present, to one is still
raging in England, and the proposed
change has many supporters. Nowadays
there is too great a tendency for a player
to concentrate on a devastating service
which gives his opponent no chance, and
there seems no sane reason why he should
be given two opportunities to prevent the
other man taking the point, for that is
what it amounts to. With the knowledge
that the winning or loss of the point de-
pended on the one shot only, the service-
above-all player would tend to pay more
attention to other aspects of his game
than he too often does at present.
(Continued on page 26.)
The Rugby League Kangaroos won
two matches against Northern Union
clubs last week. Keighley was downed
by 14-7 and Huddersfield by 13-5. Both
are Yorkshire clubs and the matches
were played under atrocious weather
conditions. Of the 24 games played to
the week-end the tourists have won 17.
* * * *
The final of the N.S.W. professional
golf championship between C. Gray, of
Pennant Hills, and W. Bolger, of Oat-
lands, at La Perouse saw a splendid
struggle, Gray winning at the 36th by
a putt. In spite of heavy rain in the
afternoon both played unerring golf, the
winner’s rounds being 70 and 68 and
Bolger’s 69 and 72 on a course of 6212
yards with a par of 72. Gray was
runner-up to Richardson last year, while
his opponent won in 1930. Kelly, of
Goulburn, winner of the Australian
open, failed to qualify for the closing
rounds.

AUSTRALIA’S Highest Quality Motor Spirit
Ins and Outs
“Gate”: The Ma State’s cricket heads
are taking no chances with the benefit
match this week for Andrews, Collins
and Kelleway, since they have insured
the Saturday takings against rain for
£lOOO, the association paying the pre-
mium. The wicket is to be covered en-
tirely to give the public a chance of see-
ing the batsmen wallop the head off the
bowlers —always a popular spectacle
except to the unfortunate trundler. As
a trial for the Australian XI, following
on the Melbourne match, the game
should be full of interest.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Yet another Australian
cricketer of promise has been shipped to
England for the Lancashire League. This
is Hunt, of Balmain, in whom N.S.W.
cricket addicts were satisfied a couple of
seasons ago they had found another
Ferris. A really good left-hand slow-
medium bowler who can bat, he played
for N.S.W. in Sheffield and other matches
from 1930 to 1932 inclusive, taking 48
wickets. He figured for Australia against
South Africa in the fourth Test at Adel-
aide, but met with no success. In Eng-
land, where he will play for Rishton club
in place of Maorilander Merritt, he
should prove a great success, as his team-
mate Hird has done.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: Last week the English
team under Jardine ended up a month’s
cricket with a draw with Patiala. Jardine
tops the averages to date with 71.20 runs.
Australians have an interest in the match
since Frank Tarrant is recorded as tak-
ing four wickets for Patiala, where he has
long been a sort of cricket and racing
mentor to the Maharajah. Frank was
one of the best of Australian all-rounders
before the war, and has a batting average
of 58 against his name in Australian
Sheffield Shield cricket. He went as a
professional to Middlesex, and for some
years figured prominently for the county
and the Players. On his last visit to Aus-
tralia he was chiefly interested in racing,
acquiring several horses for the Patiala
stables.
* * * *
A. H. Jarvis, dead in Adelaide at 73,
will always be remembered as one of
the five wicketkeepers who have carried
Australia through all the years of the
Test series with England and other coun-
tries. He was a bit unlucky in that he
was a contemporary of the incomparable
Blackham, but he won his way into four
Australian teams to England as second
’keeper—in 1880, 1886, 1888 and 1893.
A big man, he was notable for his erect
attitude at the wicket, and sometimes
could make runs in good fashion. In all,
he played in 11 Tests and as a ’keeper
combined effectiveness with a most
attractive style.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The professional-cricket
promoters who started their campaign in
Brisbane lately with much ballyhoo are
trying to invade Melbourne. A dispute
between the V.C.A. and the Collingwood
Council has lost Collingwood C. C. the
use of Victoria Park oval, its stamping
ground for years. The council has been
offered £5OO down for the rights to the
ground for the season and a gate per-
centage as well. The promoters had pre-
viously approached the trustees of the
Exhibition Oval, but got no satisfaction.
Collingwood Council, faced with an
empty ground for the cricket season,
may prove more reasonable.
* * * *
“Tenakoe”: M.L. cricketer Cromb,
who went to the Lancashire League to
play professional cricket not long ago,
has come back “reet stalled,” as they
say in the County Palatine, with the
game. The start is lovely—a real flying
one —and for the first fortnight or so
there is always a car at his door to take
the newcomer to the grounds. After the
novelty wears off, and especially if he
is not getting the expected runs or
wickets, the hireling has to catch a tram
or hoof it, while once-effusive officials
cut him dead in the streets.

The Nineteenth Hole
“Jehannum”: An interesting item of
golf news comes from Maoriland. At
Rotorua, which is not far removed from
the place where the worm never throws
a seven, a steam vent has suddenly ap-
peared in the middle of one of the fair-
ways. The incident may yet bring further
sorrow to the harassed St. Andrews
rules committee. None of the amended
laws at present governing hazards and
casual water provides for a player who
is blown up by a geyser as he is
bending over to putt, or who plays into
a boiling sulphur-pool which has sud-
denly appeared in a fairway.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: Here’s another queer golf
happening. A member of Indooroopilly
(Q.) club was addressing a ball on the
18th. Another ball arrived out of space
and knocked the teed ball off the pin—
it was a sliced ball from the 17th tee,
160 yards away. The player, being an
associate, could not do verbal justice to
the situation.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: The people organis-
ing the international golf tourney for the
Melbourne centenary tamasha have
guaranteed £5OOO prize-money, and it is
hoped this will bring over leading British
and U.S.A. pros. Unless these get ex-
penses and appearance-money as well, it
is hardly likely many will make the long
and expensive trip on the chance of
catching one of the major prizes—the
best of ’em can make no certainty of
golf. As for the amateurs, a visit from
any but the few who have good incomes
of their own seems out of the question.
The big majority of British and American
amateurs are business and professional
men with no time or spare cash for the
long trek to Australia and back again.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: It is only partly cor-
rect to say that Kirkwood and Sarazen
are asking no guarantees for their tour
in Australia (B. 15/11 /’33). That applies
only to the five matches to be played in
Sydney and, unless something upsets the
applecart, in Melbourne also. If asked
to visit other States a £2OO guarantee
must be posted. The tourists will drop
off the boat when M.L. is reached and
will play in the main centres there. They
are due in Sydney on February 26. Kirk-
wood lectures and gives exhibitions of
trick strokes as a sideline. He and Sara-
zen have been touring Canada and the
States in this fashion for some time, and
their team wofk is said to be first-class.
One feature of their tour will be the free
admission of caddies and children
under 12.
* * * *
“8.M.”: The Ma State L.G.U.’s
Mountain meeting at the Leura, Black-
heath and Katoomba courses proved a
big hit, drawing large entries and pro-
ducing fine golf. The event of the meet-
ing, the Yallambee Cup, went to Joan
Hammond, State championette last year,
after t\ing with Miss Leo Wray. Each
totalled 160 for the 36 holes. In the play-
off Joan won by three strokes, with a
card of 78 for 18 holes. Her opponent
has won the Australian and N.S.W. titles
each three times, and is still one of the
best associate players in Australia.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: The rules of golf
attempting to define what is an amateur
golfer go further than “Amateur Pro.”
suggests (B. 15/11 /’33). As they stand
at present, an amateur is one over the
age of 18 years who has not (a) carried
clubs for hire after his 16th year or
( b) received consideration of any kind for
playing or teaching or (c) remuneration
from any firm dealing in golf goods or
id) played for a money prize in any com-
petition. Further, no player known to
have received gifts of golf materials or
merchandise may enter for the British
amateur title. America has added two
other rules. An amateur forfeits his
status if (a) he lends his name or picture
for the advertisement or sale of golf
goods, unless he is a dealer, manufacturer
or inventor of them ; ( b ) permits his name
to be advertised or published for pay as
the author of books or articles on golf of
which he is not actually the author. All
these seem to cover the ground pretty
closely, but, by all accounts, they are
being sidestepped every day in the week.
Racquet and Bawl
The great tennis event of the week in
Sydney was the arrival of the members
of the English team, who travelled by
the Pacific route to meet skipper Hughes,
who had come the other way round. The
preliminary practices before the men de-
parted to play in the Victorian cham-
pionships showed Perry to be all that is
claimed for him. A big man, but as
active as a flea on a hot shovel and very
fast on his feet, he has a tremendously
powerful forehand drive, and times
splendidly. His volleying is practically
faultless, and if he has a weakness it is
in the backhand. Unlike many of the
moderns, he does not rely on pace for
his service, though he can send down
a hummer when necessary. When fairly
wound up he is going to be a formidable
proposition to Australian competitors.
Hughes is a quieter and solider type, but
extremely effective at the net. Wilde,
the McGrath of the side, is stylish and
effective on both fore- and backhand,
with a good volley. As with McGrath,
"Even to-day, after bein’ so long out o’ the game, I jump w’en anyone shouts
‘ten.’ ”
“I ALWAYS jump when ANYONE shouts.”
his service calls for strengthening. Lee
drives tremendously hard on the fore-
hand, but is weak on the other side for
a player of his class. Perry outranks all
his mates.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Crawford won the N. S.
Wales singles championship in three
straight sets, though his opponent, Hop-
man, is now probably playing better
tennis than ever before. With McGrath
the champion also took the doubles from
Hopman and Tonkin. This is his fifth
victory in the State championship, and
one must go back to 1894, when Dudley
Webb closed his winning run, to find
a parallel. Crawford has won the Vic-
torian title five successive times. Patter-
son took it six times in succession,
and won twice more after dropping a
year or two. Jack looks a good bet for
a sixth win this trip, but if Englishman
Perry strikes form he will have to gallop
for it.
* * * *
“Delia”: They do things properly in
America. When the New Jersey cham-
pionships were kicking off at Bay Head
on the sea coast, a storm blew up. Next
day no fewer than three different kinds
of fish were caught on the flooded tennis
courts. This is where the net would
come in handy, of course.
* * * *
“Milton”: Queensland tennis players
are bucked at the news that Crawford
and Moon will pair in the State cham-
pionships. These begin on December 4,
ten days before the second Test with the
Englishmen. The champion has not been
seen in Brisbane since 1931, when he
cleaned up the singles, men’s doubles
(paired with Moon) and the mixed
doubles with Mrs. Crawford as his side-
kicker.
* ¥ * m
“Hotham”: Vic. tennis world was
rocked to its bootheels when it read that
the heads had granted permission to
players to appear in shorts on the asso-
ciation courts at Kooyong. It was
announced in the press that two young
females had availed themselves of the
permission at once, and the rush of
elderly members that afternoon to wit-
ness the degrading spectacle depopulated
half Collins-street. But it must not be
imagined the hussies will be allowed to
w'ear the garments all over the place.
If they desire to use the clubhouse they
must don long trousers or dressing-
gowns. There is a lot of the old Coven-
anting spirit still abroad in Melbourne.
Car and Cycle
“Hotham”: Victoria’s Australian Light
Car Club is staging a 100-mile spin at
Phillip Island on New Year’s Day. There
is £lOO in the bag for prize-money, and
the club, following the British and Con-
tinental practice, has decided to spread
the butter as far as it will go while asking
only small entrance and acceptance fees.
The brass will be shelled out as follows:
First, a trophy valued at 20 guineas and
£4O cash; second, £2O; third, £10;
fourth, £8 ; fifth, £7; sixth, £5 ; while
there is a tenner on offer for fastest time.

“Fitzcray”: The annual Dunlop-Per-
driau census of motor-cars at Melbourne
Cup disclosed a muster of 3585 in the
reserved areas. On top of that over
2000 cars were lined up in adjacent
streets and paddocks, the value of the
iot being put at over a million pounds.
All types were represented, but, as was
the case last year, the proportion of
British cars has increased beyond all
expectations.
* * * *
“Double Op.”: The other day W.
Hewitt, of Sydney, departed for Brisbane
on a two-stroke, l|-h.p. Velocette (1926
vintage, be it said) loaded with tent, cook-
ing gear and clothing. He used the coast
road, visiting all the principal towns and
aeviating from the direct route several
times. In all, he covered about 800 miles
and his fuel cost was a little below 10s.,
the juice in question being Shell, of which
a trifle over six gallons was used.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: A queer accident marred a
cycling event at Thomastown (Vic.). Two
clubs, Northcote and Fitzroy, had races
on the same day, and the route of one
club crossed the finishing-line of the
other. The timekeeper for the Fitzroy
club was watching the line for the finish
of his event when he saw a swarm of
cyclists from Northcote bearing down.
He blew his whistle, but it was too late.
The leaders met head-on at 30 m.p.h.
Both died subsequently in hospital.
Miscellaneous
“Cam.”: The syncopated rowing fad
has been revived, with alterations. The
first method provided that each pair
of an eight should strike the water in
rotation so that the check to the boat
caused by the whole crew swinging for-
ward to the catch would be eliminated.
The new style seats the cox in the middle
of the shell, with four rowers in front
and behind him. First the four oarsmen
at stroke’s end strike the water and then
the four up bow’s way have their inn-
ings. Watching it gives the impression
that the style was evolved in a lunatic
asylum, but Pembroke College, Cam-
bridge, is responsible.
* * * *
“Burnett”: Queensland’s champion
fours were won as usual by a country
club, the Maryborough crew, rowing on
their own river, taking the two-mile event
from Wide Bay, with G.P.S., the only
metropolitan crew competing, in third
place. There was considerable fuss after-
wards owing to the oars of Maryborough
and G.P.S. clashing, this being due, as
G.P.S. averred, to the winners cutting
across and taking their water prema-
turely. Maryborough didn’t suffer, but
G.P.S. had to stop rowing and drifted
over the line in third place. A harassed
umpire decided that they had all been
out of their proper water and declined to
alter the placings.
* * * *
“Richmond”: Henley-on-Yarra’s re-
gatta comes off this week-end in Mel-
bourne. There are plenty of entries for
all the events, but as far as the boats are
concerned they are from Victorian clubs
only, an indication that the hard times
have not yet softened. The Challenge
Sculls alone take on an inter-State aspect.
In addition to six Victorians, H. J.
Turner, of N.S.W., holder of the title and
of the Australian championship, W. J.
Tipping, also of N.S.W., and F. D. Heid-
rich, from Mannum (S.A.), will take the
water. Turner should win again easily.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 14.
Among the Cheltenham Men.
Victoria G.C. is one of the Cabbage
Garden’s earliest ventures into the Royal
and Antient game. Just 30 years ago
W. Meader conceived the idea, and after
some preliminary spadework a property
at Fisherman’s Bend, Port Melbourne,
was leased from the Government. The
club spent 24 years of blameless exist-
ence there, and during that time built
up a splendid course. Leasehold tenures
are not much use to a golf club, however,
so members began to look about for a
freehold resting-place. This was found
at Park-road, Cheltenham, in 1922, and
the layout and making of the new links
were put in hand at once.
In May, 1927, members transferred to
their new home, which is rated as one
of the Commonwealth’s leading courses,
and boasts a particularly fine clubhouse.
Stanley Melbourne Bruce performed the
opening ceremony.
The first figure thrown on the screen
is that of G. P. Odium, the importer. He
is an accurate and careful player, as can
be seen from his preliminary scouting atti-
tude before driving off, and has the repu-
tation of never being in the rough.
T. E. (Tommy) Lowe, who comes
next with the “Well, what about it?”
expression, probably shot better on Gal-
lipoli than he does at Cheltenham, since
his handicap is 23. The cheerful bird
marked. 3 is Gus Cole, another whose
handicap would be a good break for the
average billiard amateur. He is a brewer.
The soulful Heavenward-directed gaze
in fourth place is that of Harry Wil-
liams, the infant prodigy of Victorian
golf. Still in his teens, the youngster
has Australian and Victorian amateur
titles to his credit. He carries a plus 3
handicap, and is known as the Phar Lap
of Victorian golf.
One would think that a person doomed
t:> edit “Hansard” would be a gloomy,
embittered chap. A. H. (“Charlie”)
Angel, on No. 5, is really a cheerful per-
sonality, and his 10 handicap proclaims
him a useful golfer. Next to him we
have Oscar Damman, who is a tobacco
merchant in his spare time. A very sound
player, now on a 9 handicap, he has
been captain of the club and ex-cham-
pion. Frith has made him look rather
like a Harry Lauder walking-stick with
a silver top, but that is just F.’s way.
The lad wearing the large pipe and
the delighted grin is C. R. Smith. He
follows the agreeable occupation of a
maltster when not golfing. That and the
fact that he is a scratch player possibly
explain his optimism— : a rare attitude of
mind among golfers.
Numbered 8, in a place where there
is no chance of overlooking it, is W.
Meader, radiating cheerfulness and cigar
smoke. A retired banker, he is honored
as the Old Original, and is still rated
as hon. sec. He does not play nowadays
—there is a ribald chorus popular at the
nineteenth to the effect that “Billy
Meader is our founder ; he can’t play
since he’s got rounder.”
No. 9 is Leo Guest, a biscuit manu-
facturer. The artist has appended no
explanation of the gloom which broods
on his countenance, but, knowing golfers
as one does, the suggestion may be haz-
arded that he is considering ways and
means of assassinating the handicapper.
The Caesarean countenance which fol-
lows is that of A. F. Brash, who deals
in musical instruments. His 11 handi-
cap denotes that he can play a pretty
fair tune with the golf clubs.
N. A. Stephens, tagged 11, is referred
to by his golf biographer as one of the
famous Stephens brothers troupe, so we
will let it go at that. He is a useful
player on a 9 handicap, and when not
showing with the brethren is a softgoods-
man.
K. E. Ross rounds off the dozen. A
scratch player, he is a tiger in golf as
in business. The allusion is to the fact
that he is a seller of Richmond beer,
which has the tiger for its trademark, to
a grateful nation.
Thirteenth we have C. A. Champion,
president of the club. A good middle-
marker, he is tremendously popular. A
retired company director.
Panama-hatted and cherubic is A. W.
(Wally) Doyle, who, in addition to being
the leader of the Stooke-Doyle Comedy
Duo —a club organisation—is one of
Victoria’s best golfers off the 8 mark.
Away from golf and amateur vaudeville
he is a solicitor.
The Victoria seems singularly blessed
with members engaged in the beer-
manufacturing industry. No. 15, J. R.
Mitchell, is in this category. Club cap-
tain and one of the best, being gener-
ally referred to as the “Maltster Colt.”
H. R. Payne, who follows the skipper,
seems to be presenting the raspberry to
the world at large in spite of the fact
that his coiffure is irreproachable. It
is hard to say what ails him—he is a
plus I—but1 —but one never knows. He is in
the insurance line away from golf.
The burly and amiable personality on
the 17 mark is A. L. Prendergast, who
is well ahead of most of his fellow-
members when it comes to the size of
his handicap—2s. One of the Mohawks,
a fellow-member describes him, but
otherwise quite safe.
S. H. (Syd) Deamer, who evidently
anticipates getting down a 6-inch putt
at last, is on the 20 mark, and is ticked
off by observers as playing champagne
golf on a beer handicap. An old R.A.F.
man, and probably the mildest-mannered
flyer who ever helped to bring down
Black Cross ’planes. Editor of Mel-
bourne “Herald.”
The chap with the “What the do
I care?” expression is F. E. Oldmeadow,
one of the early members. On 14, a
useful golfer. Judge A. W. Foster, num-
bered 20, is well to the front as regards
his handicap rating. After him comes
Robert Weir, famous for getting twos.
That doesn’t mean two hits to every
shot, for Robert is a 7-marker, and there-
fore among the elect. He is managing
director of Henry York and Co. outside
the world of golf.
J. T. Potter follows. If Frith had only
given him round tortoiseshell giglamps
and stuck a bowler hat on one side of
his head, he would be a perfect model
for a Hollywood detective. He is a
Chicagoan, and the best of sportsmen.
Sydney knew him some years ago in
charge of General Motors. To-day he is
managing director of Pepsodent tooth-
paste.
Beaming over the Chicago lad’s shoul-
der behold J. A. Okerblum, accountant
with the International Harvester Co. An-
other Chicagoan, but all the shooting
he does is at par. To date he has not
proved himself a successful gunman—his
handicap is 25.
The list rounds off with J. M. Hogg,
the assistant secretary, a very popular
official, with a great reputation for tact.
It must be warranted if it is true that •
J.M.H. once persuaded a Scottish mem-
ber who had holed in one to return to
the clubhouse instead of walking home
to Seymour from the fatal green, as the
player had originally intended.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
FARMERS’ WOOL TROUBLES.
“Sheepo”: The preparation of the
wool clip is often a worry to owners of
small and mixed flocks. The reclassing
charges made by brokers for emptying
wool out of the bales, classing and re-
pressing it are small compared with the
gain to owners. If farmers would adopt
the following three points their wool
returns would increase, buyers’ com-
plaints would be reduced to a minimum,
and dealers and repackers would have
to find another profit-making avenue.
(1) Skirt the fleeces carefully.
(2) Bale all fleeces after being rolled, inde-
pendent of any features associated with them,
with no attempt to class. Bale bellies, skirtings,
locks and stained pieces separately.
(3) Brand and number the bales without the
addition of the description each bale contains;
consign to the broker and ask him to have
the wool reclassed.
No farmer has ever lost through hav-
ing his wool treated in this way. Hun-
dreds have unknowingly gained as much
as 3d. per lb. on the fleece portion. A
trial will convince farmers who just
bundle their wool together in any old
fashion that benefits are to be gained
from the adoption of the procedure.
VALUE OF MERINO EWES.
“Golightly”: In October, 1932, I pur-
chased 1000 well-bred merino ewes, four-
year-old, off-shears, for £2OO, and joined
2 p.c. Dorset rams. In early April I
marked 77 p.c. of lambs and joined rams
again. In September a further 22 p.c.
was marked. Wool from ewes returned
£468, fat sucker lambs £3BO, 200 shorn
ewes trucked with lambs £BO ; net total,
£928. There are still (31/10/’33) 750
ewes and 365 lambs to be marketed. A
similar purchase here this year (Central
Tablelands, N.S.W.) cost me 7s. per
head. Albury (N.S.W.) saleyard market
reports (30/10/’33) the sale of four one-
year-old merino ewes at 4s. per head. It
may pay wheat farmers to consider these
returns.
INTER-LOTTING AND POOLING.
“Trepex”: “Inter-lotting,” a service
gratuitously rendered by woolbrokers,
consists in selecting a number of what
would be star lots and bracketing them
into one big lot to be sold as sqch. It
is generally done with satisfying results
to the seller, buyer and broker. The
different constituent bales to such a lot,
however, often present an irregular
appearance to the seller’s untrained eye.
Every grower thinks his bale or bales
are the best in the lot. The buyer is not
disturbed by any superficial differences.
If the “inter-lot” is reasonably uniform
in length, quality and general style, it
is confidently bought. In most cases the
contents of the bales, if turned out and
blended, would make a straight line, fit
for any buyer’s order. It would be more
effective if growers would submit their
oddment for sorting and pooling by some
competent, reliable establishment, which
would deal with the actual contents of
the bales. The pooled product would
be sent to sale, and the pooling estab-
lishment would render account of
weights, prices and receipts to the
grower.
This job is beyond the broker’s
scope, but there are other means.
Already a semi-official company is doing
good work on these lines, and a large
quantity of wool, reclassed and repacked
under the Imperial purchase scheme, on
subsequent sale in London, was com-
mended.
It is impracticable to make a proper
sorting of wool in the sheds. “Rough-
ing” is necessary in some cases. Sort-
ing and pooling by a more central body,
acting for different growers, could obvi-
ate both methods. If depots were scat-
tered in various districts wherein the wool
tends to take on a similar appearance
and character, the wool could be handled
before it was staled by enclosure in a
tightly-pressed woolpack. The scheme
would give lengthier employment to
many woolclassers, which is necessary
to the preparation of our clip for market.
This country has been content too long
to export a crude, greasy clip overseas
for other people to handle at a profit
which should be ours.
FOR THE SOUTHDOWN.
“A.J.8.”: Although the sheep expert
has said that the Dorset Horn is the
most suitable ram for lamb-raising, Vic-
torian experiments and London experi-
ence have proved that the Southdown is
the type nearest the ideal. Reasons are .
(1) It is superior to any other cross in maxi-
mum of meat and minimum of fat and bone.
(2) Its weight is comprised in a shorter car-
cass than any other —a freight consideration.
A short, full-muscled joint has more
appeal to a buyer than a long one. The
hindquarters have a fair envelope of
fat, giving the carcass a pleasing appear-
ance when frozen. Most crosses, includ-
ing the Dorset Horn, through lack of this,
show up dark. A very serious fault of
the Dorset Horn cross is its grossness
after four months. Over-developed hind-
and forequarters give it a sheepified
appearance. This class of lamb is classed
as a teg, both here and in Britain. The
Southdown and Ryeland maintain their
lamb characteristics up to six months.
“Golightly” should visit an export
abattoir —Victorian for preference. He
would get all the information he needs
as to the type of lamb required. The
value of the skin is no criterion of the
carcass value.
WASTE FODDER.
“Sheepo”: Splendid rains over much
of the Mitchell grass areas of Queens-
land early in the year and again in early
winter produced a wonderful feed
growth. Graziers have not yet taken
advantage of what nature offers in
reserve fodder supplies. Probably not 1
p.c. of sheepowners had sufficient grass
cut or stacked as a standby for their
rams.
Sheep-grazing must always remain
a gamble in Queensland until some pro-
vision is made for drought periods. The
hot weather has already started to
scorch-up the Mitchell grass plains ; a dry
spell of a few months will again see
thousands of sheep taking to the stock
routes and owners looking for agistment
country. Millions of tons of fodder are in
the central-west and western areas —more
that sufficient to keep the sheep at home
during drought periods. On one C.
Queensland station, which stores fodder, a
saving of £20,000 in 18 months by stack-
ing excess grass growth was estimated. It
would have taken more than this sum to
either artificially feed or pay for agist-
ment country. The fodder reserves saved
the departure of the sheep. Artificial
feeding would have been out of the ques-
tion.
Failure to take advantage of a super-
abundance of grass in generous sea-
sons has been a big factor in keeping
up the drought percentage losses and in
increasing the overdraft. It is only by
not depending on the vagaries of nature
and by feed and water conservation that
sheep grazing in Queensland will become
worth while.
WHITE CLOVERS.
“Hatter”: White clover, like all cross-
fertile species, comprises a large number
of distinct types, but it may be roughly
grouped into Dutch white, English wild
white, New Zealand wild white certified
and N.Z. ordinary uncertified. The wild
white is different from the Dutch, in that
it has the property of throwing out long
runners which take root and spread over
bare patches. The English (or Kentish)
strain has this spreading habit well de-
veloped, but the seed is costly ; the N.Z.
wild white has shorter runners, but is
characterised by larger leaves and a
strong-growing habit. By virtue of its
earlier and more rapid growth it is better
adapted to one- and two-year leys than
the English. The Dutch variety is con-
spicuously inferior to either, even in the
first year’s harvest. The N.Z. ordinary
seed is very superior to white Dutch, but
considerably less productive than the wild.
It deteriorates rapidly in the second and
third years. Where clovers will flourish
in Australia, the certified N.Z. seed is
one of the most desirable pasture plants.
It should supersede white Dutch or N.Z.
ordinary. Even in England it yields
better than the indigenous wild white.
NEATSFOOT OIL.
“Mulgo”: Neatsfoot oil has many
uses. It is valuable on farms and stations.
It is made easily. At many places feet
and shank bones of adult cattle, from
which it may be obtained, are thrown out.
Scald the fresh feet and shanks
as you would scald a pig. Scrape off the
hair. Then put them in a kerosene-tin
with enough water to cover them. When
the water boils let it simmer for two
hours. Skim off the oil that rises to the
surface, and continue simmering until no
more oil appears. Strain the oil through
muslin or cheesecloth. Then boil it to
get rid of any water that has been
skimmed up with it. When cold, bottle
it ready for use.
Many who make oil don’t clean the
feet and shanks, and boil them with the
hair on. The hair then comes out in the
strainer and the oil is dirty. Others let
the feet and shanks “ripen” for some
days before boiling. The result is bad-
smelling oil, unpleasant to use. It also
leaves its bad smell on the harness.
MAMMITIS.
“Hatter”: No real cure has yet been
found for mammitis (B. 1/11/ ’33),
but it can often be checked by
early treatment. The symptoms are
easily recognised. Heavy milkers are
most likely to be affected, especially when
they are coming in. The animal then
shows the usual signs of sickness —fever,
a harsh coat, dulness and an inflamed
and swollen condition of the udder. Best
treatment is a purgative (lib. to l|lb.
Epsom salts, 11b. treacle and 1 table-
spoonful ginger in lqt. water). Milk
every three hours, even through the
night. Use hot foments three times a
day. Follow this by gentle massage with
olive or camphorated oil. Milk out the
affected quarter often ; germs breed
rapidly in milk.
Infection may occur through any
scratch or wound, but it is usually car-
ried up the teat canal by germs. Dirty
yards, soiled hands or dirty stools often
start the trouble. Be scrupulously clean.
Wash the udders of the cows well before
milking, and clean the floors, utensils,
machines and hands in some disinfect-
ant, say sodium hypochlorite.
Cows which have apparently recov-
ered from the disease may yet be chronic
carriers. This condition can only be
detected by an examination of the milk
by a competent analyst.
THE FUNCTION OF FALLOW.
“Kilkivan”: Professor Richardson, of
Adelaide, has revealed some new factors
in regard to fallowing and artificial
manuring.
For many years Dr. Richardson, as
head of the wheat side of Vic. agricul-
ture, advocated fallow for wheat-grow-
ing, at that time believing that the sole
function of fallow was the conservation
of moisture. Since then it has been
proved that the bare summer working
of land accumulates nitrogen, and that
an efficiently fallowed field accumulates
the equivalent of four or five cwt. of
sulphate of ammonia.
Reasoning from this, crops have been
grown on stubble land to which liberal
dressings of nitrates were given, and the
experiments proved that results were the
same, i.e., that by adding two or three
cwt. of sulphate of ammonia to the super,
when sown with the seed on the stubble
crop, the results equalled those on check
plots of fallowed land. And 34 p.c. of
the cereal crops of Australia are grown
on stubble.
Incidentally, Dr. Richardson’s experi-
ments show that 85 p.c. of the nitrogen
and phosphorus used by a plant are
absorbed from the soil in the first four
weeks of growth, and that the bulk of
these elements are found in the seed.
Over 96 p.c. of the plant’s requirements,
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, are taken from
the air. Of the remaining 4 p.c. the
principal constituents are nitrogen, phos-
phorus, potash.
Potash is the only one which seems to
be definitely dissolved in the plant
stream. Its peculiarity is that there is
actually less of it in the plant when ripe
than during the growing period. It is
not incorporated to any large extent in
the seed. Its function is to assist the
leaves in their operations of turning the
plant foods to starch in the seed.
Cases have been noticed where excess
potash has retarded this operation, to
the detriment of the yield. It is now
recognised that phosphatic manures re-
quire the presence of nitrogen to be
effective. If this is not added by nature
through the operation of fallowing, it
must be added artificially, and must be
done at seeding so that full use can be
made by the plant in the first stages of
growth.
EXPERIMENT FARMS.
“G.D.R.”: N.S.W. Agriculture De-
partment runs a number of experiment
farms—or used to run them. Now the
farms run the department —into debt to
the tune of £50,000 a year. Hugh Main,
the Minister, made the admission.
He should know. Not liking the annual
slug, the department transferred Yanco
to its cousin, Public Instruction, which
established a welfare farm there; and
makes it pay.
A similar change was proposed in the
case of the Berry farm. Meetings of
protest were held. Infuriated deputa-
tions haunted head office. The Min-
ister agreed that it had done good
work. Its grassland experiments were
valuable; its dairy herd was above
the average; stock it sold to farmers
was popular; but it was losing heavily.
He promised to visit the farm before
making a decision.
That was several months ago, and Mr.
Main has not been there yet. Mean-
while, irritated local farmers are com-
posing hectic harangues against depart-
mental dilettantism. They object to the
farm being branded as a heavy losing
concern. They admit a debit of £lOOO
last year, but claim that if the farm
got a fair spin it would come out on the
right side. The place has certainly been
starved. Last season there was no lime
for pasture improvement. There is no
up-to-date machinery. Head office is
deaf to requisitions; cow yards yearn
for cement; silos and their contents are
rotting ; initiative is balked ; the incen-
tive to make the farm pay is lacking.
SUPER.
“The Chid”: Of the main plant foods
—phosphoric acid, nitrogen and potash
—Australian soils are notably deficient
in the first. Superphosphate is the most
efficient and economical form in which
to apply it to the soil. Phosphoric acid’s
function is to stimulate the development
of the plant’s root system. It thus in-
creases the plant’s feeding area to a
marked degree. It encourages' seed for-
mation rather than vegetative growth
and the growth of leguminous plants such
as clovers and lucerne. It is necessary
for the maturity of plants.
Superphosphate is manufactured by
grinding to great fineness the raw phos-
phatic rock, mainly from Nauru and
Ocean islands, and then treating it with
acid to convert it into a soluble form.
The availability of phosphoric acid in
superphosphate is its chief advantage
over other fertilisers containing the same
plant food. The form in which any
plant food is applied to the soil is im-
portant. Agricultural authorities agree
that the most soluble fertiliser gives the
best results.
If using a slow-acting fertiliser use a
greater quantity to get immediate re-
sults. This explains the popularity of
superphosphate as a medium for the
application of phosphoric acid. It has
the capacity to become thoroughly mixed
with the soil, which produces an even
growth, and to act rapidly on pastures
and crops. Soluble phosphate increases
root growth, thus giving the plant a
greater area from which to seek its food
and moisture, and enabling it to resist
droughts.
In 1840 the German chemist Liebig dis-
covered that, by adding oil of vitriol or
sulphuric acid to bones, their phosphate
was rendered soluble. The raw rock
phosphate is found in various parts of
the world, but Australia has almost at
her back door two of the highest-grade de-
posits known —Nauru and Ocean islands,
almost on the Equator. They are con-
trolled by the British Phosphate Commis-
sion. The quantity of phosphate on the
two islands is estimated at not less than
100,000,000 tons, which is equivalent to
nearly 200,000,000 tons of superphos-
phate. The present superphosphate con-
sumption in Australia is not quite
1,000,000 tons a year.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Tena”: A wooden spoon absorbs the
fats, and, if not clean, is apt to spoil the
cream. Use a tin one.
“Eureka”: A bunch of tea-tree tied
firmly to an old broom-handle makes a
good yard broom. A piece of stringy-
bark, well beaten at one end, makes a
first-class whitewash brush.
“Karaway”: If mice are troublesome
in the barn, half fill a kerosene-tin with
water. Stand it near a box with the neck
of a bottle projecting over the water ; tie
a piece of cheese on the end of the bottle.
The mice run along the bottle to get the
cheese and slip into the water.
“Tenrag”: Here is a cheap and easy
method of preserving eggs. Smear the
outside with a good commercial petro-
leum jelly ; it does away with the messy
waterglass job, and saves the use of ex-
pensive rubbing preparations. First see
that the eggs are 24 hours old; clean
them with a moist rag and then rub the
jelly on thoroughly. It closes up the shell
pores. Place the sharp end down in a
crate or in a box with cardboard parti-
tions and store in a cool place.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What are the chances of a competent primer
getting work in the citrus orchards abom
Gosford (N.S.W.) ? What is the usual rate
of pay for primers and packers in that dis-
trict ? —8797. . ,
Work in Gosford district in citrus orchards
is very difficult to find. It is inadvisable to
seek it there, as times are bad. Rates ot pay
vary considerably, but are mostly below the
basic wage.

CIDER
A PLEASANT HEALTH DRINK
The apple is the only fruit con-
taining phosphorus, which is so
essential to build up a strong nerve
force. The most fearless men in
the British Navy came from the
cider-drinking counties of England.
The cider for good health is
KITZ’S.
Dr. Haig (the great London Autho-

“Millevva,”
via Kenmark, S.A.
October 11, 1933.
Dear Sirs,
“I have almost completed fumigation of a 3000-acre
paddock, a great portion of which was literally, honey-
combed with burrows and, generally speaking, was one
of the worst rabbit paddocks I have ever seen—inci-
dentally, it is very scrubby, and there is a large quan-
tity of dead timber lying about. Up to date, I estimate
an' 85 per cent, kill, but owing to the fact that only
one machine has been in operation we have experienced
considerable opening up behind the machine. Under the
circumstances, and considering the type; of country, this
is understandable.
“I will be quite frank and say that your process is
the only fumigating process worth considering and buy-
ing. I have had a great deal of experience in rabbit
destruction, and flatter myself that I should know.
“....I might mention that we have sealed 10,000 open-
ings to date, and are now completing the second run
over the paddock, two men, one machine; time, approxi-
mately eight weeks.”

The Wool Market
Last week Sydney market closed with
prices 10 p.c. above rates current for the
week previous, and still tending in sellers’
favor. Clearances again were very full.
In face of the quantities offering in all
Australasian centres, 120,000 bales com-
ing up for sale in London next week, and
big sales in almost every other wool-
producing country, it certainly argues a
strong demand for the finished woollen
manufacture. Including official private
transactions, the total offered in Sydney
was 57,906 bales, which realised an aver-
age price of 16.1 d. per lb. and £2O 11s.
lid. per bale. These prices are a little
above average appraisement price, an
acceptable figure in the face of bigger
production costs, and it looks as though
the whole of the current clip will approxi-
mate to this level, or nearly 100 p.c.
above the whole of last year’s wool clip.
* * * *
Good trade is now reported from
everywhere, and Golden Square in Lon-
don is having a more prosperous turn-
over than it has had for some time. Brad-
ford spinners and topmakers are work-
ing overtime on payable orders.
* * * *
Millmen are bidding up well in the
wholesome belief that even if the prices
they have to pay cut their profit margin
they are getting the turnover.
* * * *
The particular point for growers to
appreciate is the wisdom of having met
the market when prices were not so good
as they are now. Past season’s clips have
gone into consumption, have been used
up at the prices people could afford to
pay, and are not now forming a menace
of accumulated supplies.
Country-selling
“Trepex”: In the face of present prices
for wool, where is the man who still
advocates country-selling? Cases are
numerous where growers have sacrificed
a net sd. to 6d. per pound in cold blood.
Bigger losses are not at all uncommon.
The country-seller who has lost as little
as 3d. per pound is a lucky man. But,
as with the racecourse punter, one does
not hear a man talk about his losses.
Chilled-beef Prospects
“A.R.”: On his return from London
last week Queensland grazier V. D. Bell
said there appeared to be no future
for Australian beef on the English
market unless in a chilled state. The last
shipment of chilled meat had aroused
much interest at Smithfield, and London
dealers wanted regular consignments.
Australian exporters should endeavor to
arrange for such shipments.
Comparative imports of frozen and
chilled beef into U.K. are:
Frozen, Chilled,
in quarters, in quarters.
1925 .. .. 2,187,000 5,285,000
1932 .. .. 1,067,000 5,520,000
In 1932 our share of Britain’s frozen-
beef imports was 673,000 quarters. Our
total beef exports, if anything, are falling
away slightly, although last August’s
figures were an improvement on August,
1932.
The basis of a successful chilled-beef
industry is the production of the proper
class of chiller steer (B. 8/11 / ’33), fat-
tened close to the points of treatment.
At present Australia cannot provide the
works with this class of steer, nor are
existing plants fitted to handle chilled
beef. Moreover, overseas transport of
a special kind and a marketing organisa-
tion to handle beef immediately on its
arrival abroad are necessary.'
With the development of the huge
areas of pastoral land at present almost
unstocked—especially in the N.T. —and
the provision of the facilities mentioned,
Australia could become a big factor in
the world’s supply of chilled beef. She
could make her name for chilled-beef
production just as she has done it with
merino wool. Australia’s wool-selling sys-
tem has been described as the best in the
world. Why not her chilled-beef market-
ing?
Rain in Wheat Areas
Rain has fallen over the wheat crops
of three States, N. S. Wales, Victoria
and S.A., at the moment when harvest-
ing is beginning. The damage in some
areas will be serious.
Some enthusiasts a few weeks ago
placed the probable Australian crop at
over 180,000,000 bushels. It is expected
that the total Australian yield will be
not more than 165,000,000 and possibly
only 150,000,000 bushels. This, of course,
is provided the wheat areas affected now
dry up and rain ceases.
Rain in the northern districts of N. S.
Wales has had a serious effect on the
crops, but conditions in Victoria, pro-
vided there is no further rain, may be
hopeful. Victoria’s season is generally
a month behind that of the Mother State
and the rain came in time to do some
good. In the Riverina ripe crops will be
damaged, but later crops are likely to be
improved.
Japan’s Wheat Supply
“L.S.”: For the first six months of this
year Japan’s wheat imports amounted
to 11,250,000 bushels, of which Australia
supplied about 80 p.c. It is predicted that
this quantity will be displaced by Man-
churian wheat; but plans may go awry.
Dairying is also to be largely expanded.
Arrangements, it is said, have been made
between a well-known Tooley-street firm
of dairy produce merchants and Japanese
authorities to carry out the project.
Already Manchurian butter is reaching
Shanghai, where it is coming into com-
petition with Australian tinned butter.
Last year Australia shipped to the East
5894 tons.
* * * *
“Bismarck”: Second-hand wheat bags,
a favorite with many farmers to-day, are
usually false economy. They often have
been used for wheat off black-oaty coun-
try, and consequently Carry many seeds
of black oats. They are used to keep seed
wheat in, and so the oats is spread
through the wheat field. In a short time
it takes control unless steps are quickly
taken to eradicate it. The bags are also
used as nosebags for the horses. Black
oats can only be eradicated by grading
the seed wheat and keeping these bags off
the place.
If the land is well worked so that the
seeds will germinate, and an early-matur-
ing variety of oats is sown, the crops
can be then cut or fed off before the
black oats mature. A long fallow will
often clean up this pest.
Hides and Skins Exports
There has been an astounding im-
provement in the exports from Australia
of hides and skins. For July, August and
September last year exports totalled
£648,007; for the three corresponding
months this year, £1,561,482 —over 140
p.c. increase. Skins topped the poll at
£677,314, an increase of £380,964.
Butter Unchanged
“8.5.”: There has been no price altera-
tion, overseas or locally. W.A., the only
State market to move, had a weekly sur-
plus, and chopped the price to Is. a lb.
wholesale. That brought her prices
nearer London parity. Sydney and Mel-
bourne prices are nominal. Few grocers
dream of paying the fixed rate; they
demand |d. off and get it. In larger
businesses |d. to Id. discount is allowed.
Why fix prices if they are not observed?
* * * *
If the industry is not careful it will
lose its box charge. For years 2s. 6d.
a cwt. has been added to the wholesale
rate. It was meant to cover cost of the
container; the cube box has a resale
value. Grocers grudgingly paid the
extra. They now hold the big stick. The
charge has been wiped out, and the cost
of cartage waived. Prints, too, are ex-
pected at the same price as bulk.
* * * *
Trifles such as these do not bother dis-
tributors. The producer foots the bill.
Not that there is much left to do it
with. Two years ago N.S.W. local price
stood at 151 s. 10s. To-day the nominal
rate is 114 s. 6d. There is not much
being sold at that figure. Even at the
so-called fixed rate the dairy-farmer is
4d. a lb. poorer than he was in ’3l. His
overhead has not come down proportion-
ately. The monthly factory cheque, even
for peak supplies, is meagre.
* * * *
High costs and small returns have led
to the latest stabilisation scheme. It
required State legislation and a Federal
blessing. Queensland’s bill is through ;
Vic.’s is nearly there. Mr. Main is put-
ting the N.S.W. bill through this week.
Mr. Stewart holds the key. His several
statements have not been clear; the last
in particular was involved. The industry
does not know the type of bill he will
hand out. It is doubtful if at present he
knows himself, though he has said if all
States agree the Commonwealth will.
* * * *
Still, even if the industry gets the legis-
lation it wants, it won’t be out of the
wood. Farm butter and margarine
threaten stability. The growth of the
former has been enormous in the last
two years. It is not subjected to official
supervision; it breaks the market for
the factory brand, and it is not subject
to the Paterson levy. The main trouble is
the regulation of the home-made article.
It would require an army of civil ser-
vants to police it. Even then “bootleg”
butter would be common.
* * * *
The overseas market is unchanged. It
has actually remained at 86s. for a fort-
night. Last week’s arrivals in London
were over 2000 tons down. That is tem-
porary only. Supplies do not seem to
have had much to do with price levels.
For the first 14 weeks arrivals from Aus-
tralia, M.L. and Argentina, at 1,355,670
boxes, were over 250,000 down. Yet the
market, instead of hardening, steadily
dropped. With heavy increases in arri-
vals January levels in London are likely
to be round about 70s. That will be 10s.
to 15s. lower than the price last January.
Jam Melon for Export
“Man-of-Kent,” from Canterbury
(England):
The Bulletin never loses an opportunity to
help the man on the land. The new Markets
section is proof of this fact. Apart from pro-
ducing, it is essential to find markets for the
goods produced. Take melon jam. With
proper organisation a tremendous trade could
be built up overseas. Melons, tins and cases
would be produced locally, and the sugar grown
in Queensland. The crop would fit in as a
rotation crop—one or two years wheat, then
one year melons. In a good yeas, a fair crop
would be 50 tons per acre. At £2 per ton
at the factory the grower would be on clover,
and the melons could be delivered over a period
of several weeks, as they will keep.
Some of the big trading companies in Eng-
land, with shops in every town, would take a
thousand tons a week if the price were right
and a continuous supply guaranteed. India, too,
is a potential market. The demand for jam,
jellies and marmalade in England is stupendous.
One Cambridgeshire firm employs 3000 hands
all the year, with extra help in busy seasons.
Classing the Clip
“Sheepo”: “Murrawong” (B. 1/11 /’33)
says “the wool-classer’s job is to divide
the clip into parcels, each for some par-
ticular branch of the textile industry.”
This is a misrepresentation. A qualified
sorter can do as “Murrawong” says, but
not 1 p.c. of classers could. Every fleece
in the most uniform flock contains vari-
ous qualities. This is sufficient evidence
that orthodox wool-classing, as carried
out in sheds, can never prepare wool
suitable for any branch of the textile
trade ; the latter job is for a sorter. The
classer’s duty is to place the fleeces in
their different grades according to length
of staple, quality, condition, color and
soundness, and freed from all fribs, stains
and dirty wools. If his work is carried
out well he merely does the preliminary
work for the sorters.
“Murrawong”: Any sheepowner who
can fulfil the requirements mentioned by
“Lion” (B. 15/11 /’33) should be able to
class his own clip. But not 5 p.c. of
them would get a 100 p.c. pass.
A sheepman whose experience is
limited to his own sheep gets a distorted
idea of spinning counts. If one of his
flock grows a 70’s quality fleece in a
drought year, his standard of 70’s will be
based on that sheep, although a flush
season may follow and grow a bold,
shafty 64’s on the same animal. The
average sheepman lacks the time and
opportunity to get about among sheep in
other districts, to make comparisons.
The professional classer, with specialised
training, handles all sorts and conditions
of wool, and usually spends the off season
in a sorting store. This is practically a
post-graduate course in spinning counts.
“Lion” insists on the importance of
yield and stresses the extreme difficulty
of mastering the art, yet he expects the
sheepowner to handle fleeces for a few
weeks in the year and understand it.
There is a type of fleece which prac-
tically every amateur classer puts in the
wrong bin —the showy white fleece,
heavy as an old ram’s ; it shows up too
much in the yellow condition line where
it belongs, so the yield of the top line
is sacrificed for appearance sake.
Two of the best sheepmen I know do
not class their own clips. They say that,
even if they had the knowledge to get
up their wool to buyers’ requirements,
they have enough additional worries.
Stock Improvement
“Mulga”: “El V.” (B. 15/11/’33)
strikes the soundest note of common-
sense for years. What’s wrong with hav-
ing stud farms everywhere? Farmers
should have the services of the best farm
or heavy draught, the best Friesian or
Ayrshire, the best Hereford, the best pig’s
father. It could even extend to the
poultry industry. The State could furnish
the studs, and, at fixed rate, secure these
services so as to, in a few years, make
Australian herds and flocks the envy of
the world. We have the country and
climate to do it.
“More Per Acre”
“Yelir”: Many wheatgrowers and
small farmers are now awake to the
increased remuneration offered by per-
manent pasture. To profitably employ
old cultivation or any surplus arable
land lay down a sward of mixed, per-
manent and nutritious grasses and
clovers.
Different grasses and clovers suit dif-
ferent soils. An ideal pasture contains
about 25 p.c. clovers and 75 p.c. grasses.
Throughout the N.S.W. wheat belt (rain-
fall, 18in.-25in.) soil and climatic condi-
tions are ideal for the laying down of a
sward. On good average wheat land with
a fair depth of soil equal quantities of
lucerne, Wimmera rye and Rhodes grass
sown at 61b.-81b. per acre have given
fine results.
In sowing a paddock the first cost is
the only cost. . Prepare the land thor-
oughly, even to fallowing and harrowing.
A good, fine seed-bed is essential. Buy
only the best seed, and sow it only about
|in. deep. Eighty-four lb. super., sown
with seed, ensures a good, even growth
after rain.
Once established the sward needs little
management. After heavy stocking far-
row the paddock thoroughly to distribute
the stock-droppings. The tearing-up of
the pasture will do it good. An applica-
tion of either 561 b. or 841 b. of super,
every second spring will rejuvenate and
increase the growth. Stock prefer top-
dressed to untreated pasture, owing to
its higher mineral content.

Flood-prevention
“Crow’s Nest”: Brisbane, nearly
wrecked and crippled for years by the
flood of ’93, has been talking about pre-
venting a repetition of the disaster ever
since. So far the only precautions taken
have been the deepening of some sections
of the lower river and the removal of
parts of obstructing points so as to
straighten out bends.
Some time ago the Bureau of Industry
appointed a special committee to con-
sider the matter. The plan put forward
combines flood-prevention with water-
conservation. The Brisbane rises in moun-
tainous country over which there is at
times a tremendous sub-tropical rainfall.
It has a steep fall, and the water, spilt
rapidly off the steep watersheds converg-
ing on the head of the river, comes down
in huge quantity, which every successive
cloudburst increases. The gist of the
scheme outlined by the committee is the
holding back of this floodwater by two
dams in the rain area. This would not
only keep much of the flood from the
lower reaches of the river, but would
provide sufficient water storage to cover
Brisbane’s needs for the next 30 years.
Finance, of course, is the problem,
since there are no engineering difficulties.
The committee proposes to spend
£2,000,000 on the project—three-fourths
loan money and the balance from un-
employment relief tax funds. The loan
will add £75,000 at 4\ p.c.
plus i p.c. for redemption
to the State’s annual in-
terest bill. The relief-tax
money is already being
raised for other purposes
and would not add to
State costs.
At present there does
not seem much hope of
getting the money.

Another Bradfield Bridge
“Ann St.”: Brisbane is
fairly well off for bridges
over its big river—there
are two within quarter of
a mile of each other at
the southern end of the
city, one of them being a
railway bridge. But the
tangled windings of the
stream, which practically
confine the heart of Bris-
bane to a small peninsula,
make it imperative that
yet another outlet from
the city be found. The
proposed new bridge, a
high cantilever job with
ample clearance for ship-
ping bound up river, will
cross from Petrie’s Bight to Kangaroo
Point, at the opposite end of the city to
the existing bridges.
When the idea was first put forward,
plenty of money was on offer by pri-
vate enterprise, provided toll franchises
were granted. The Government declined
to consider these, but recently got
the Loan Council’s endorsement for
£2,000,000. The estimated cost of the
bridge is £1,700,000. It is stated that the
A.M.P. will advance the ready money,
and Dr. Bradfield has been asked to
design the job. The Government hopes
to repay the cost with a basic toll of 6d.
on motor-cars and a penny for each pas-
senger. This is to pay interest and main-
tenance as well as a sinking fund, which
is expected to wipe off the total cost in
25 years. A point in the scheme’s favor
is that it will employ 1000 men for about
four years.
There is still £30,000 owing on Victoria
Bridge, which replaced that destroyed in
the 1893 flood, and a lot yet to be paid
on the Grey-street structure, a couple of
hundred yards from it, which was com-
pleted a year or so ago.
* * * *
“Kuranda”: Cairns won’t know itself
shortly. Government intends to spend
£30,000 on a building 176 ft. long which
will house all the public departments
about the place. What with Chinatown
gone and fan-tan being suppressed, the
city is getting quite metropolitan.
* * * *
“North Quay”: Brisbane trams, owned
by the City Council and usually a couple
of jumps ahead of their opposite num-
bers in other States, have started a new
system of concession fares to customers.
Weekly tickets for all journeys covering
two or more sections are to be issued
at a 25 p.c. cut. They cover 12 rides
for the week from Monday to Saturday
inclusive, and allow one ride each way
for each day. On the single sections
passengers already have the privilege of
buying (concession tickets which give
them 10 rides for Is., instead of 2d. a
section if they pay in the ordinary way.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: The Anglican Mission in
Papua many years ago erected the first
lighthouse on the north-east coast, at
Dog’s Hill (Cape Vogel), and recently the
captain of the mission boat MacLaren-
King, with his native crew, put down
45 concrete beacons to mark the route
from Wanigela to Buna roads, 100 miles
long, where reefs make navigation dan-
gerous. Most of these are sunk two feet
deep in the coral, and rise to some height
above the water at high tide. The natives
of the neighborhood are duly apprecia-
tive of the white man’s new idea, but not
for the purpose designed: they use them
as posts to which to moor their canoes
when fishing.

“Vic.”: E. B. Wareham, who retires
from the Sydney managership of the
Adelaide Steamship Co., is a good north-
erner with 54 years’ shipping service be-
hind him. When he entered the business
in 1879, the Palmer was in full swing.
Steamers of the old A.S.N. Co., which
could almost be placed on the boat-
MARY: “My bin dreamin' last night you gibbit me pfive pounds”
JACKY: “Cripes, dat a lot of plurry money; but you can keep it”
decks of modern coastal liners, used to
go northward with fortune-hunters
stacked in rows on the decks. From
1885 to 1887, he managed the Cooktown
office. There, too, all the talk was of
gold, but in 1887 the A.U.S.N. bought
out the A.S.N., and the young manager
went off to be a merchant in Darwin.
Seven years later he was back into ship-
ping as Townsville manager of the
A.U.S.N., and he became inspector and
attorney for Queensland in the following
year. Wareham was senior vice-president
of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce
for a term, and for six years, in two sec-
tions, was chairman of the Inter-State
Steamship Owners’ Association in Syd-
ney. He is Rockhampton-born, and has
seen as much of northern heat as any
man. But although at the retiring age he
still looks youthful enough to start on a
new job, as no doubt he will, since his
experience is too valuable to be left idle.
* * * *
“X”: Another Mt. Isa dispute has
closed, temporarily at least, the dusty
little mine which Alam, a N.S.W. Legis-
lative Councillor, once declared to be
so valuable that Australia’s creditors
would be glad to take it in payment of
our national debt of £1,100,000,000.
Houses stand empty in rows ; 84 people
were arrested on one train for attempt-
ing to scale the railways for fares to the
coast. To make matters worse, the beer
gave out. The Government is desperately
anxious to keep the mine open, and not
only because miners’ votes turn the bal-
ance in three or four electorates ; and the
A.W.U. has been working to the same
end. At latest the Industrial Court was
seeing what it could do.
* * * *
“Vic”: The report of the Mareeba
Tobacco Committee makes sad reading
for northern growers. Lack of sunshine
at the right time, the beating down of
plants by rain and the prevalence of rot
all seem to be factors. The committee,
while admitting that tobacco factories
have unfairly rejected some leaf, ex-
presses the view that the rejections were
due to legitimate buying mistakes. At
the B.A.T. stores, the members saw 1000
bales which had been turned out, but
only six seemed to be worthy of accept-
ance. More than 40 p.c. of last year’s
output was refused. But it is difficult to
understand why, if 60 p.c. of leaf is
usable, the other 40 p.c. cannot be im-
proved to practical quality.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: The report of the League
of Nations Commission on the Mandates
shows the futility of that expensive ex-
periment in meddling. After 13 years’
experience of New Guinea administra-
tion, one solemn delegate asked the Aus-
tralian authorised representative —who,
of course, had never been in the Terri-
tory except perhaps on a brief holiday visit
—“why the native population was not re-
presented” in the new Legislative Council,
and “who was to criticise native policy”
if there were no natives in the local Par-
liament to do it. Personally, I should
like to see the native represented. The
spectacle of the M.P. for Nether-Alexis-
hafen arriving sans trousers but avec
Mary, monkey, dog and betel-nut bowl
and taking his sweaty seat beside some
of the more immaculate Councillors of
Rabaul would be even funnier than that
of “Bull” Ryrie trying to fend off the
Liberian delegate.
* * * *
“Nakanai”: The effects of cheap Jap
labor are being felt in New Britain in
the matter of bicycles. Since these aids
to travel can be imported from Nippon
for about thirty bob, every nigger burns
to own one, and feels when he gets it that
his rights as a native citizen free him
from all traffic restrictions other than
those imposed by Providence. Some streets
on a market morning are, therefore,
a dodging tangle of bright young society
things driving motor-cars at 40 miles an
hour among a whirl of yellow persons
pushing Fords along at 60, both classes of
traffic swerving in bewildered fright
among two-wheeled darky rockets which
hurtle down the road in mad parabolas.
One shrinks to think what a self-respect-
ing Bezirksamt would have done to them
in old days, before the war.
* * * *
“Danaus”: Queensland’s annual cen-
sus showed a decrease of 823 in the num-
ber of full-blooded aborigines for the
year ended June 30. The largest drop
was in the Coen district, where the num-
bers were almost halved (1110 to 579),
but this might be due to tribal movement
in the Peninsula. The total for the State
is now only 12,532. Half-castes con-
tinue to increase. Bananaland now has
4425, 371 more than at the last count.
Even at the missions and reserves half-
castes increased by 97 and full-bloods
by only 48, less than half. At the three
Government settlements Cherbourg,
Palm Island and Woorabinda —on the
other hand, full-bloods were 95 more and
half-castes only 38 more than last year.
* * * *
“Only Dave”: The sacredness of the
mail was well understood by savage
Binghi. A messenger’s life, save in times
of war, was about the safest on the Aus-
tralian continent. The runner’s badge
of office was a long cleft stick, and his
job mainly the summoning of widely-
separated groups to religious gatherings,
marriages and burials. The journeys
sometimes ran to hundreds of miles, and
under the aegis of his stick the messenger
was granted safe passage through ordi-
narily hostile tribes, and fed as well. F. J.
Kell, of Powell Creek station, once sent
a “paper yabber” (letter stuck in cleft
stick) to some exploring scientific friends
in this fashion, and had it safely deliv-
ered into their hands at Whanaluru
Lagoon, 190 miles away. On his jour-
ney the abo. bearer passed through the
fierce Umbaia, Gnangi and other tribes
safe in the protection of his sacred wand.
* * * *
“C.P.C.”: One of the wildest of Aus-
tralia’s birds is the white-quilled rock-
pigeon (Petrophassa albipennis), which is
found only in the sandstone areas of the
Kimberleys and on the western side of
the Territory. Though brown for the
most part, the bird, by reason of a white
throat and a patch of metallic-green on
the wings, is a good-looker. Either in
pairs or in extremely small flocks, the
birds rely on their coloration for protec-
tion, and it is only when they rise from a
rocky ledge with much heavy flap-flap-
ping that they are noticed. They feed
on the seeds of grasses and spinifex, and
between July and October, if you have
lots of luck, you’ll find a nest —just a
tiny hollow on the ground beneath a
spinifex clump or an overhanging rock.
Two creamy-white eggs is the usual
clutch.
* * * ' *
“Ex-Trooper”: Ants have been re-
sponsible for bringing at least one Aus-
tralian criminal to justice. This was at
Roma (W.Q.) 40 years ago. A series of
shop burglaries had the police baffled.
After some weeks a constable and a
tracker located a mysterious stranger
camped in the middle of a patch of
scrub about 10 miles from the town. He
was arrested on suspicion, but a thorough
search of the camp and its surroundings
failed to reveal any trace of stolen goods,
and the constable was about to depart
with his prisoner when there was an ex-
cited shout from the tracker, who was
down on his knees examining an ant
trail. The abo. had noticed that the
ants were carrying grains of white sugar
from somewhere in the scrub to their
nest near the camp. The trail was fol-
lowed for about a quarter of a mile into
the scrub, where it disappeared inside a
large hollow tree-stump, which proved to
contain the loot. A packet of sugar had
burst, and it was the ants’ discovery of
this that betrayed the thief, who went up
for a long stretch.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
At the C.W.A.’s birthday party at Sandgate
Lady Wilson cut a big iced cake ornamented
with eight blue candles. Mrs. J. P. Peterson
told guests standing at attention that, during
1933, 155 women and 195 children had been
provided with happy holidays. To most it
was their first glimpse of the sea.
Freda Bage decorated her room at the
Women’s College with fluffy candytuft and tall
coreopsis to brighten a bridge party in aid of
the nursing appeal. She wore a black mariette
frock with a sparkling buckle on the belt.
Lovers of art went to the Gainsborough Gal-
lery when Donald Cameron opened Roy Park-
inson’s exhibition of water-colors, which
include two pictures of Sydney Harbor.
Our own river bank, viewed from New Farm,
has given the artist a very fine subject,
while further inspiration came from the
jacaranda. In sky-blue marocain, with beige
hat, Mrs. Roy proudly stood by. The Cameron
jady came with her husband. Gwendolyn
deserted her own exhibition for a few
hours.
Lady Wilson motored to Wynnum the day
the School of Arts celebrated its 21st birthday.
Barbara Sisley, who had combed her studio
for talent, put on a very good programme of
dialogues and recitations. Lady Mayoress
Greene saw that a big birthday cake occupied
pride of place on the afternoon-tea table.
To increase the funds of the Musical Associa-
tion, 200 bridge players turned up at Griffiths’s
tearoom to be welcomed by president Les Edye
and his wife, she wearing green and white
floral. Mrs. Gilbert Wilson and Mrs. Percy
Brier were two of the committee women.
Violet Midson has been persuaded by the
associates of Brisbane Golf Club to be their
honorary secretary for another year. It is hard
work, but Violet smiles through all trials and
tribulations. She not only interests herself in
golf, but gives her time to almost all our
charities.
Cocktails were shaken on the Nankin fpr a
number of our best-known people. Marjorie
and Peter Wilson came along with C. H.
Feilden, the Governor’s new secretary. Others
on board were A. V. and Mrs. Logan, the
Glasgows, the Arthur Moores and Dr. and
Mrs. G. Macartney.

A party of three want to take a sea cruise
to Singapore in a boat of their own. (1) Where
could a suitable boat, 30 ft. or 40 ft. long, cost-
ing about £lOO, and fitted to take an engine,
be obtained ? (2) What knowledge of navigation
would be required for such a trip ? (3) Instru-
ments required for navigation ? (4) Would
we have trouble in obtaining a passport ? (5)
Need the vessel be registered ? (6) Are we
likely to meet with any trouble from authori-
ties while on the voyage ? (7) How much does
i. patent log cost ? (8) Books helpful for such
a trip ? (9) Are charts procurable in various
scales? (10) Cost of necessary instruments?
(11) Should one of the party be a competent
navigator ?——8641.
(1) Many firms in Sydney buy and sell boats.
Most of them advertise in the Saturday issue
of the “S. M. Herald.” (2) You would have
to be able to read charts, find latitude and
longitude, steer by compass and find the devia-
tion of the compass. (3) Chronometer or
good watch, sextant, compass, and either a
patent log or a log line and glass. (4) There
should be no trout in obtaining a
passport if application is approved. (5)
The vessel need not be registered, but British
registration would be advantageous under
certain circumstances, especially at foreign ports,
where the British Consul could be approached
if in difficulty. (6) If port regulations are
observed, there is no reason why there should
be trouble with authorities. (7) Price obtain-
able from any ship chandler. (8) Nautical
tables, time Azimuth tables, nautical almanac,
and sailing directions for route to be covered.
(9) Yes, large scale for coasting work and small
scale for extended voyages. (10) Obtainable
from firms selling same. (11) Yes. This is
essential.
(1) What is the correct name, “deaf adder”
or “death adder” ? (2) Largest adder re-
corded (a) in Australia, (b) in the world ?
(3) What is its color and method of striking ?
(4) Can it change its color according to its
surroundings ? (5) / have seen a snake about
18in. in length, with a small head and com-
paratively thick body for its length, colored in
bunds of black and grey, the body terminating
in a small whip or flail about two inches in
length. Is this an adder ? —8698.
(1) Acanthophis antarcticus is known both as
deaf adder and death adder. It is not deaf, but
derives that name from its habit of lying very
still and allowing a person to walk over it.
Deaf adder is considered a better name than
death adder, which name unduly frightens
people bitten by it and lessens their chance
of recovery. (2) The largest preserved at the
Australian Museum (Sydney) is 36in. Can’t
say what is the world’s record. (3) and (4) It
does not alter its color as does a chameleon,
but individuals vary in color from brown to
grey, with dark cross bars, and they usually
tone with the earth of the district in which
they are found. When disturbed this adder
flattens out its whole body and darts right and
left very quickly. It slightly raises its head in
the act of striking. (5) Yes.
My house is infested with red-back spiders.
They build along fences, under tanks, in wall
crevices. Could I use a spray to destroy them ?
—B7Bl.
Spiders, not being insects, do not succumb
easily to sprays, which are practically useless in
their eradication. The only method is to hunt
them out and destroy them. Make a raid now
and again with a stiff broom and plenty of
boiling water. Allow no rubbish to accumu-
late, and bury all unwanted tins, bottles, etc.
A painter’s blowlamp is effective along fences,
crevices, etc. If you keep up the war for a
few weeks, they can be dispersed.
(1) What is the most economical and efficient
method of studying interior decorating ? I am
employed between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. (2) Is it
advisable to also study illustrative art in con-
junction ? (3) Where should I study ? (4)
Approximate length of course ? (5) When
through course, best method of seeking a posi-
tion ? —8764.
(1) First of all, have your eyes tested for
color-blindness; this is much more common
than generally realised and would be fatal to
your ambition. Then consult the director of East
Sydney Technical College, at Darlinghurst. If
you cannot carry out his advice regarding a
course at the college, write again. (2) No;
but you must have a knowledge of colors in
their relation one to another, an elementary
knowledge of design, period furniture and archi-
tectural interior design, the qualities of fabrics
and some acquaintance with the decorative uses
of pottery, china, metal and pictures. (3) and
(4) Both depend on what you decide to do;
supervised reading would shorten the course.
(5) Apply at any of the large shops handling
furnishing fabrics, furniture, etc., or work up
a business of your own. The latter takes time
and capital, unless managed in spare time for a
start.
What are the distinctions between flag, general,
field, company, regimental, staff, warrant, petty
and non-commissioned officers in .the navy and
army ? —BB9l.
Flag officers are naval, ranking from rear-
admirals upwards; general officers are military,
ranking from brigadier-generals upwards; field
officers include colonels, lieut.-colonels and
majors; company officers are regimental officers
from captains downward; regimental officers
arc all officers, from second lieutenant to colonel,
whose duties are connected with a regiment, bat-
talion, battery, etc.; staff' officers are oliicers of
any commissioned rank in navy or army who
have special duties not confined to a ship or regi-
ment, and a special relation to a commanding
officer; warrant officers are petty or non-com-
missioned officers of the higher grades, such as
boatswain and sergeant-major, who hold an
Admiralty or War Office certificate; petty
officers in the navy and non-commissioned
officers in the army are men given authority
by the commanders of their units, and not
necessarily holding warrants.
(I) How many gaols are there in N. S.
Wales ? (2) How are they classified ? (3) What
class of prisoners is sent to the prison camps ?
—8892.
(1) Twenty-five. (2) and (3) Six principal
gaols, eight minor gaols, 11 police gaols. The
principal gaols are the State Penitentiary for
men and the State Reformatory for women
(both at Long Bay, Sydney), and the gaols at
Parramatta, Bathurst, Goulburn and Maitland.
The smaller gaols are used for prisoners under-
going short sentences, and for those who re-
quire special treatment apart from other long-
sentence prisoners. Amongst the minor gaols
are the two afforestation camps at Tuncurry
and Mila and the Emu Plains Prison Camp.
Prisoners under 25 years of age (usually first
offenders) are trained in farm work at Emu
Plains, while at Tuncurry older men are em-
ployed on a pine plantation. Mila is for
young men other than first offenders. Police
gaols are used for detention of persons sen-
tenced for periods not exceeding 14 days.
(1) What course does the Hawkesbury River
(N.S.W.) take ? (2) Why is it known under
different names in different places ? (3) Length ?
—BBB3.
(1) ft has its source at the southern end of
Lake George, in the Mulwarree Ponds. This
creek runs north to join the Wollondilly a little
north of Goulburn, and under the latter name
traverses deep gorges (of which Burragorang is
the best known) in the ranges west of Berrima
and Picton until it receives the Cox River from
the Blue Mountains. Thence known as the
Warragamba, it flows through another gorge
into the Nepean, takes that name and proceeds
n.-e. past Penrith to meet the Grose; from the
junction with this river the stream is known
as the Hawkesbury and passes Richmond and
Windsor to enter the drowned estuary at
Broken Bay. (2) Because various portions were
discovered and named before their connection
was known. (3) 335 miles.
Can you tell me anything about the man
after whom Fremantle (W.A .) is named? Did
he ever visit Australia ? —BBBO.
Fremantle (W.A.) is named after Sir Charles
Howe Fremantle, a naval officer, second son of
Admiral Sir T. F. Fremantle, a companion of
Nelson. Born in 1800, he entered the navy
iti 1812, and saw active service as a midship-
man at the blockade of New Orleans in 1814.
fn 1828, when in command of H.M.S. Chal-
lenger, he was ordered to proceed to the Swan
River to take possession for the British Crown
of “all that part of New Holland which is
not included in the territory of New South
Wales.” He arrived on April 25, 1829, and
on May 2 hoisted the Union Jack on the south
head of the river where Fremantle now stands.
Captain Stirling and other officials, together with
the first band of settlers, reached Swan River
on June 1, and the Challenger left Swan River
on August 28 for India. Sir C. H. Fremantle
served with distinction during the Crimean
War, became commander-in-chief at Devonport
and died in 1869.
(1) What is the correct composition of a
brick ? (2) How long does it take to air-cure in
the tropics ? (3) How long to burn it ? —8770.
(1) Depends on materials available and
method of manufacture. Suitable beds of clay,
of different chemical or mineral structure, are
known to produce different sorts of bricks; they
are ground in mills and formed into bricks with
water, no other material than these clays being
required. Each bed of clay or each district
clay must be examined, analysed and tested
to determine the kind of brick it will make, so
that the correct treatment may be given. (2)
Curing is done in drying rooms with heating
apparatus and fans. Air-curing is variable,
especially in the tropics, on account of the
great moisture in the air. Probably about 48
hours, but tests must be made to determine
the time. (3) Depends on the nature of the
clay and the kind of kiln used.
(1) What restrictions are there upon the im-
portation into Australia of live birds from New
Guinea ? (2) Any exception in the case of
tame pets not for sale ? (3) Are parrots for-
bidden for fear of introducing psittacosis ?
(4) If so, does the prohibition apply to parrots
intended for presentation to Taronga Park 7
8683.
(1) A Customs Proclamation of 10/9/’27 pro-
hibits the importation into Australia of all
birds except with the consent of the Minister
of Trade and Customs. (2) No. (3) Yes.
They cannot be imported except with the con-
sent of the Minister of Health. (4) Yes. For per-
mission to import birds other than parrots,
apply to the Collector of Customs in the
State in which importation is to be made.
For parrots, apply to the Director-General of
Health, Canberra.
What conditions must be observed in the im-
portation of birds into Maoriland ? —8873.
Authorities for importation are restricted to
birds coming from Great Britain and Ireland
and from those Australian States which have
been officially declared to be free from New-
castle disease for not less than six months.
Birds must be accompanied by (1) a declaration
from the consignor to the effect that they have
been in the country of origin for not less than
six months immediately prior to the date of ex-
portation and have not been affected by or in
contact with disease; (2) certificate from an In-
spector of Stock at the port of departure to the
effect that they are free from ticks, and (3) a
certificate from a Government officer in the
country of export as to health. On arrival in
the Dominion they must be examined and
passed by an Inspector of Stock. Better com-
municate with the M.L. Government offices in
Sydney or Melbourne before making arrange-
ments.
(1) Is the Commonwealth Bank Board the
sole Australian authority for issuing bank-
notes ? (2) What arrangement exists whereby
the ordinary trading banks acquire Common-
wealth Bank notes ? —8686.
(1) Yes. (2) Trading banks may acquire Aus-
tralian notes by cashing a cheque on their
account with the Commonwealth Bank or, sub-
ject to the approval ol the Commonwealth
Bank Board, in exchange for money or securi-
ties lodged with the London branch of the
Commonwealth Bank.
(1) What is the color of Kingsford Smith’s
Percival Gull? (2) Where can I obtain plans
for a model of this ’plane ? —8557.
(1) Eau-de-nil. (2) Probably not obtainable
in Australia. Kingsford Smith Air Services,
Mascot, N.S.W., may be able to help you.
What is neurasthenia, and what is the latest
and best treatment for it ? —8630.
It is a derangement of the nerves. There is
no set treatment and no “latest and best treat-
ment,” except that the modern tendency is to
put patients under the care of a psychiatrist.
My Australian silky dog constantly scratches
and pulls out his hair. He has, a weekly bath
and apparently no fleas. Cause and cure ?
8652.
The dog is probably suffering from mild
dermatitis, due to wrong feeding. Put him on
a milk diet for a time, with the addition of
vegetables chopped fine, and twice a week give
a feed of raw meat only. Don’t feed more
than twice a day. Give two baths, at weekly
intervals, of loz. potassium sulphurata dissolved
in one gallon of water.
How should a damp brick wall be treated
when the dampness rises from the ground, the
damp-course ( Malthoid ) having apparently
perished? The wall is a hollow one and has
been recently painted on the outside. —B726.
The only satisfactory treatment is to insert
a damp-course of slate, which should have been
put in when the wall was being built. At a
suitable height for the damp-course, a narrow
horizontal channel is cut between the bricks
with a flat, sharp chisel, pieces of slate of
correct width being inserted and closed with
cement as well as possible. Only a small
portion of wall is done at a time. If the Mal-
thoid is visible it can probably be raked out in
sections to admit the slates.
(1) What is the effect on the attraction
between magnets when their distance apart
is doubled ? (2) Which type of magnet is the
more powerful, the permanent steel or the
electro-magnet ? (3) What factors determine
the attractive power of an electro-magnet ?
—8825.
(1) Magnets attract or repel one another with
a force inversely proportional to the square of
their distance apart. If the distance is doubled
the attraction between the magnets will be
one-fourth of what it formerly was. (2) For
given weights, electro-magnets are the more
powerful. (3) The size and material of the
core, and the ampere turns.
How should the words “all right’’ be written ?
Is the use of all-right, allright or alright good
English ?— 8927.
The words should always be written separ-
ately. There is no warrant for the use of the
combined forms.
Is there a difference in the meaning of “com-
placent” and “complaisant” ? —8723.
“Complacent” means self-satisfied; “com-
plaisant,” anxious to satisfy others.
(1) What waters does the giant boar-fish fre-
quent, and does he move in shoals ? (2) When
does spawning take place and how are the young
fry developed? (3) What food does he live
on ? (4) Is a large hook necessary for his cap-
ture and what bait should be used? —8793.
(1) It frequents sandy ground in fairly deep
water off the coast, and is generally of a soli-
tary disposition. (2) Spawning takes place dur-
ing the warmer months of the year in the deep
water habitually frequented by the fish. Nothing
is known concerning the development of the
young fry. (3) Crustaceans, molluscs, marine
worms and enchinoderms (starfishes, sea-urchins,
sea-cucumbers, etc). Its elongated snout is
well adapted for sifting the sand and probing
rocky crevices in search of food. (4) A fairly
small hook is necessary, as the fish has a com-
paratively small mouth. For bait, a prawn or
piece of cunjevoi is favored.
Do the words “glossary” and “vocabulary”
mean the same thing ? —8783.
Both are partial dictionaries, and so far
synonymous; but a glossary is usually a guide
to unfamiliar terms, while a vocabulary in-
cludes all terms necessary to express ideas.
Vocabulary has also the meaning of the whole
stock of words used by a nation, by any set
of persons, or by an individual.
(1) Where can I get information regarding
raising palms from seed ? (2) Are Kentia and
Cocos palm seeds procurable in Australia ?
8598.
(1) An account of the raising of Kentia
palms is contained in G. K. Cowlishaw’s “All
About Palms” (W. J. Cryer and Co., Ltd.,
Arnold-place, Sydney; Is. 6d.). The cocoanut
palm and its culture is treated in O. W. Bar-
rett’s “The Tropical Crops” (MacMillan Co.,
New York; 10s., plus exchange). (2) Kentia palm
seeds, when available, are obtainable from the
Secretary of the Lord Howe Board of Con-
trol, Chief Secretary’s Department, Macquarie-
street, Sydney. Town Clerks of Mackay,
Bowen and Cairns (Q.) might supply names
of people willing to supply cocoanuts for seed
purposes.

G. Seismic records were not kept in
1780, but there can be no doubt that there
was some simple natural reason for the phe-
nomenon. .. .W.M.C.: Published novels by
“Brent of Bin Bin” are “Up the Country,"
“Ten Creeks Run” and “Back to 800 l Bool,”
each 7s. 6d. “Men of Gang Gang” has not
yet been published... .H.Y.: As none of The

public, an estimate of rank is impossible....
R.8.J.: There is a small article on the sub-
ject in “The Australian Encycloptedia.” See
also J. F. Hogan’s “The Gladstone C010ny”....
H. : The Darling proper is navigable in
time of freshets as far as Walgett, 1758 miles
from its confluence with the Murray E.S.C.:
Hyperbole is the use of exaggerated terms for
the sake, not of deception, but of emphasis, as
when “infinite” is used for “great,” or “a
thousand apologies” for an apology T.R.:
St. Luke’s Day is October 18; St. Martin’s Day

the University of London. Applications for
admission to the courses and all inquiries should

versity of London, South Kensington, 5.W.7.
C.D.W.: The mere fact that he had incurred
a debt would not affect his license. You could
sue in the ordinary course W.J.H.T.: Yes,
both. “Every receipt or discharge given for
or upon the payment of money amounting to
£2 or upwards” requires to be stamped with
an adhesive twopenny duty stamp and duly
cancelled ... .F.W.: The European languages
spoken in the New Hebrides arc French and
English. There is no unification of the native
language; each island speaks a dilferent longue,
and there arc many different dialects in the same
island. The lingua franca is pidgin-English....
J.A.: Yes, it was not only the .birds of Aus-
tralia that interested John Gould. In 1844
he brought out a “Study of the Macropodidte”
(kangaroos), with 45 plates, and between 1845
and 1863 produced three volumes on “The
Mammals of Australia,” with 182 plates

advice could be given M.G.: (1) Ehrlich is
credited with the discovery. (2) Germany.

term for itching. The causes are many and
varied, and the cure lies in quelling the cause.
Impossible to indicate treatment without inspec-

General... .K.W.: “Henry Handel Richardson”
(Mrs. Robertson) married Prof. John George
Robertson, Professor of German at London
Uni., who died last May....F.P.: “The Out-
sider” was by Dorothy Brandon; first produced
at St. James’s, London, 1923. Maurice Mosco-
vitch played in it in Australia during his 1924-25
tour D.C.: Milk and cream supplied for
consumption or use within the Sydney metro-
politan milk distributing district must be de-
livered to the Milk Board, unless under special
authority of the board, given only to suburban
dairymen. It would not be possible for a
dairyman at Gosford to supply cream to re-
tailers in Sydney... .G.W.M.: Obtainable from
any of the big booksellers, 7s. 6d W.T.:

old type of hectograph contain dextrin, zinc
oxide or barium sulphate in addition to gela-
tine and water... .L.M.: Pressing is done in
the usual manner with a damp cloth and a
warm electric iron; the iron must not be hot,

Finely powdered casein, 1 part; sijicate of
soda, 3 parts. Rub together to the right con-
sistency. Casein cements are used to resist heat
rather than water... .A.H.: The cheapest pas-

“Nobbys”: It was mentioned in B.
25/10/’33 that the plate mill erected at
Port Kembla (N.S.W.), under the super-
vision of Eugene Rogers, was the only one
in Australia. This is no longer the case;
a plate mill was installed at B.H.P.’s
iron and steel works at Newcastle dur-
ing the closing months of 1932. Except
for some small specialised items of equip-
ment, the whole mill was manufactured
in Australia, and was erected under the
supervision of this great Australian con-
cern’s Newcastle staff.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: Road is beating rail hands
down in Vic., as far as conveyance of
racehorses is concerned. Clapp’s de-
partment used to net an average of
£40,000 p.a. in this class of freight, but
last year the figure was less than half of
that. In Melbourne the motor floats take
the mokes froth stable door to stable
door. Owners prefer it that way to pat-
ronising the railways, cheaper as they are.
* * * *
“Wollard”: ’Possums were protected
in Tas. during the season just ended, but
trappers took 149,210 kangaroo- and
171,184 wallaby-skins, valued at approxi-
mately £64,000. Government’s share in
royalties and license fees totalled £4142.
In an open season, furred skins generally
bring about £250,000 to the Speck. Prior
to the close season last year, however,
only 52,975 kangaroo and 68,025 wallaby
were taken in 1931.
* # * *
“Subiaco”: Since July, 1931, the num-
ber of persons employed in Westralian
factories has increased from 12,334 to
16,259. Not a bad showing for the
alleged victim of Commonwealth oppres-
sion ; and it would be better still if seces-
sionists made a point of buying the pro-
duce of the one Westralian woollen mill
instead of letting that concern rely chiefly
on customers in the effete eastern States.
«j» jJ;
“Valerin”: In N.S.W. in 1920-21 wheat
brought Bs. lid. per bushel; flour, £l9
7s. 6d. a ton. Bread was selling at 5.9 d.
per 21b. loaf. In Sydney last September
wheat was 2s. Bd., flour £9 17s. 6d. and
bread 5.1 d. Explanation? You will find
it in the distributive system, which is
riddled with duplication and incom-
petence.
* * * *
“Anti-Mastodon”: In a dark hour the
Sydney building trade heard with delight
that Anthony Horderns had decided on
a great scheme of improvements to the
historic department store on Brickfield
Hill. Part of the work is still in pro-
gress, but sufficient has been completed
on the Pitt-street frontage to admit of
Premier Stevens going along one day last
week and declaring the new lower ground
floor officially open. Stevens declared
that “Anthony’s” had “contributed much
to the growth of Sydney and N. S.
Wales.” So it has, of course ; but the
blade-straight business owes nothing to
Governments which did away with the
64 modern ’bus services that used to
bring people to Central Station and com-
pelled shoppers to come to town in their
obsolescent trams —trams which, because
of the high footboards, are a nightmare
to old ladies and young mothers carry-
ing babies.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: Slot machines installed
in London to sell 2s. worth of stamps in
book form are not always responsive ;
it has been found that they jib whenever
a Queen Victoria florin is used. These
coins contain slightly more silver than
later issues, and so are a fraction thinner.
Persons using worn and bad coins are apt
to be blocked by the automatic machines
at Circular Quay. An attendant rushes up
and inspects the coin, much magnified,
as it reposes in the machine. If it is
merely a worn one, he rectifies the
machine’s mistake ; if it is a dud, entry
is blocked.
# * * *
“Fellah”: A cable tells that Gyppo
butter, made from buffalo milk, has been
marketed in forged wrappers certifying
it as Australian. The Gyppo is probably
the ablest forger of trademarks on this
earth. His Government once had to pay
heavy damages to the distillers of famous
French brandies whose labels were imi-
tated, bottles specially imported being
filled with some dreadful compound
which nearly ruined their reputations, as
far as Egypt was concerned. Australians
with the A.I.F. in Egypt will recall the
popularity of a brand of whisky, the
owners of which claimed that their
bottles could not be refilled. It was a
very disgusted lot of Diggers who learned
later that they could be. The trick was
done by boring a hole in the bottom of
the bottle and closing it with a blowpipe
after filling. A forged capsule over the
fixed stopper finished off a neat job.

L.A.C.: Quite good album verse R.P.:
You rhyme poorly, you seem to have no ear
for metre, and your spelling is atrocious....
F. : Bald, laborious versification....
J.W.C.: Too mechanical, although the ending
almost redeemed it....A.McK.G.: Almost sad-
dening in its smug cheapness A.S.C.: No
hope... .M.C.: The best we can say is that you
seem to have read Gray’s “Elegy” with profit
as far as the form goes G.I. : It took some
time to decipher, and the return was nil
LJ.D.: And a very rocky, rutty road it i 5....
G. : An ultra-boyish ebullition... .P.J.1.:
The blemishes are far too frequent J.E.O’S.:
We never saw it before, and we certainly
shouldn’t describe it as “a gem.” Half the
lines don’t scan properly, and the “dawn-
morn” rhyme sets the teeth on edge C.P.L.:
Repetition carried to that length destroys the
effect it is intended to produce... .J.M.: It
doesn’t appeal.... W.P.A.: No space for reprint.
. ...J.1.: It would be worth your while to pay
more attention to form A.M.: There are
some good lines; others seem mere sacri-
fices to the exigencies of rhyme D.A.T.:
Take more water in it R.H.E.: Poem on
blowflies in “their blue-green, shining
armor of opalescent sheen” firmly declined.
. ...H.M.A.: Afraid it could hardly be pre-
sented as a topic of general, apart from
purely personal, interest E.M.: The feeble
endings kill it B.B.: About the limit in
childishness H.A.G.: The only place for
them would be a school magazine... .W.C.:
The live minutes of our valuable time that you
bespoke weren’t ill-spent. But you are too
didactic for a light-verse writer; you try to
hammer too much moral into your offerings.
F.D.T.: Has a faint glimmer of promise;
try some less hackneyed subjects A. 8.: Can’t
find any trace of it. You are quite at liberty
to submit it elsewhere J.H.R.: We can’t do
anything with them for reasons previously given.
... .D.W.: The eternal conflict between Religion
and Science can hardly be compressed into
14 lines... .G.P.C.: There may be a chance for
you in the lighter forms of jingle, but outpour-
ings such as
The world to me no peace doth hold,
I would to me that death its arms enfold.
are emphatically not poetry, or anything re-
motely resembling it....E.5.: It isn’t a sonnet,
except that it has 14 lines. And there is noth-
ing in it tfyat would make a readable sonnet.
....Mario: “All, all, in vain,” summarises it.
. ...Mak: You have a fine flow of ideas, but
until you grasp the fact that “dawn” doesn’t
rhyme with “form” or “feathers” with
“endeavors,” we can’t see any hope for you.
. ...R.T.: As wild and untamed as the typing.
.... Bellerive: Certainly you are entitled to
your reply to correspondents, whatever they
may have been saying:—
While samples from my pen doth flow,
If right or wrong the critics know.
The Bulletin is not a stage
For hero stunts nor villains’ rage.
They’ve regular duties to pursue.
What do they care for me or you?
By candle light and pale lamp oil
I wrote my poems and lived by toil.
I’ll battle on till timed to cease;
I could dip the pen before the police.
H.P.: Tightened up, and with a little more
action, it might pass D.C.8.: It was only too
obvious what the end would be J.D.: The
doctor is overdrawn W.J.A.: It might have
happened, but the way you write does not make
it seem possible A.S.M.: None of the three
is a Bulletin story L.M.N.: You wander
too much.... W.Y.: No cheque for “No
Stamps”.. . .8.W.: Heavy going A.T.K.A.:
The plot is familiar, but can’t trace previous
publication.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
1.G.: Dead from the waists downwards....
E.G.: All those twists and curves can’t cover up
your artistic sins... .H.G.: Unattractive mer-
maids and a bewhiskercd wheeze.... R.L.M.:
The idea is too indefinite, and the drawing
crude... .A.K.W.: The wash drawing is tho
better, but it doesn’t get past K.S.: Shorten
your jests and put more punch into your
sketches W.A.: A few more like that and
we’ll be on the verge of a breakdown H.V.:
Retort is merely abusive C.R.: Done with
care, but gag is mouldy T.L.F.: Not a penny-
weight of promise J. 8.: The eyelashes look
all right; the rest looks all wrong M.C.H.:
Don’t make your lines so fine C.C.: Look
like figureheads from some ancient hulks
T.8.P.: The gag was so hot that it set our
automatic sprinklers working... .E.A.N.: Wait
till your work becomes more mature before
sending another bunch W.S.L.: Freakish
style alone doesn’t compensate for the poorness
of the rest... .R.G.8.: What is it a picture of —
three men having a drink, or three logs of wood
resting against a bar counter? AJ.T.: The
arms are attached badly... .N.K.: Why are all
your characters crop-eared? ... .J.M.: Linework
too bristly E.K.: Lady is misshapen and
angular C.T.: Not hailing you as the find of
the year C.S.H.: Blurred and smudgy
E.S.M.: Cow-farmers seem to be clad in kero-
sene-tin suits J.R.: No vitality about them.
L.M.: There are sufficient persons of import-
ance in Australia to caricature without having
to go abroad for subjects P.S.: Fair first
attempt—keep on G.V.: You draw like a
suburban signwriter E.J.W.: One of the
oldest boarding-house gags M. 8.: Your
mythology is as muddled as your art
G.P.: “Afraid they’re not much good.” Agree.
... .M.R.: You might have attached their arms,
legs and heads to their bodies 8.A.: Not a
smile in any of them... .F.F.: Five months too
late with the census wheeze S.C.S.: The
ping-pong balls are all right F.D.: Rather
photographic, but quite promising... .W.H.: It
has been making old maids titter for centuries.
. ...T.P.: Wouldn’t pay for tea and toast.


FRIENDLY SERVICE
ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won’t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one week’s

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Last Wednesday Sydney’s brightest and
best hurried down the laneway that leads
from Hunter-street to the basement' below
Macquarie-street where the Dante
Alighieri Society has its home. Here
round, squat pottery jugs of cocktails
and mountains of savories stood on long
trenchers, below pictures of Italy’s great
and boldly designed posters of her attrac-
tions. By the time a hundred and fifty
or so guests had squeezed themselves into
the tiny rooms, and the library shelves
had been completely hidden behind a
frieze of humans, the Marchioness Torri-
giani and daughter Waltha, who were
the excuse for the party, arrived. The
Marchioness (she was a Miss Fiaschi)
has grace of figure and poise of manner,
and clothed the two effectively in crepes
whose dark background was spattered
with flowers. Mrs. E. Fiaschi, the very
youthful stepmother of the titled guest,
made an efficient Hebe, her figure trig
in dull blue crepe.
Italy’s Consul-General and his wife
were important people. Bertie Kelly was
an early arrival and babbled Italian as
fluently as he plays the violin ; Dr. H. M.
Moran and his bright-eyed wife were
other Sydney-grown bilinguists; Mrs.
Bernardi smiled happily ; the presidential
Baccarinis did the honors; the Piero
Fiaschis and the Hugh Poates were
glimpsed ; Mrs. Tom Rolin stood tall and
straight in her summer suit. More and
more men kept dropping in, among the
University contingent Professor Water-
house and Professor Sadler. Miss Egan,
Eileen Hollingdale, the Hughes lady and
Mrs. Stassi, the Tom Bavins, Commander
Gifford and the Hon. Greville Baird, a
Government House guest, were others in
the squash.
The sweetest flowers that blow twisted
into shapes they never dreamed of were
handed up by the shoal to Clara Butt
after the gong-like contralto had poured
its tones over an enthusiastic and un-
resisting audience in the Town Hall. Up
the steps, in spite of the rain, had chat-
tered and clattered girls and boys, men
and women, five out of ten of whom you
could have taken a pretty safe bet were
oratorio and choir singers. Private cars
had slid up to the steps ; taxis had emptied
their loads; Charles Westmacott and
Claude Kingston, of J. C. Williamson’s,
stood impressively under the chandelier
in the vestibule; to the right or to the
left, according to the color of its tickets,
the human traffic had been diverted.
Clara, in absence, had lost none of her
popularity, and she staged her reappear-
ance with unerring showmanship. Stand-
ing in front of a well-filled organ loft
was a stately high-backed chair tied up
on the left with a great red-and-gold
bow. A royal-blue drape fell down the
right, and the cushion was of turquoise.
To this semi-throne the singer made her
way, very slowly (an after-effect this, no
doubt, of her accident some time ago).
But she carried herself regally. From her
glittering tiara to the hem of the lus-
trous sheath of off-white satin she was a
queen of song, and she wasn’t going to let
you forget it. Her scarf of azure blue
had a silver lining and a silver fringe ;
one end of it she had twined about her
left wrist, whence it meandered its silver
way to the tip of her shoe.
Trahlee, the nice old home of the
Mark Sheldons, is happy these days, for
it is spreading its wings about the family
once more. The knight and his lady have
been putting up for some time at the
Australia, but, with the arrival of
daughter Mrs. Marcus Rex and her
husband from Malaya, and son Cuthbert
and his bride from England, Trahlee be-
comes the scene of the family’s social
activities once more. A cocktail party
of such size that you wondered if the
drinks had been mixed in barrels brought
all Sydney’s social headlights to the Belle-
vue Hill address. The Cuthbert Sheldons
are making their first home close by.
Up in the annexe to Nock and Kirby’s
Pompadour room on an afternoon last
week, when warmth lay soft and wel-
come as carded wool over the city, Wil-
son Ewart and Margaret Dreyer raised
their voices in song, while a small com-
pany of the city’s writing women
applauded in the intervals of consuming
cakes and strawberries. Wilson has a
resonant bass-baritone which gambolled
in English meadows of song, while Mar-
garet’s soprano aeroplaned up to high C
and the moon in “Caro Nome” and such-
like coloratura fare. Beyond the veil of
this small room lies the shining acre or
so of dance-floor already famed among
Friday night dinner dancers, and beyond
that again is the glitteringly appointed
kitchen said to be able to cope with
three thousand appetites at any given
time.
Fashionables and art-lovers are politely
mobbing the Boyded salerooms these
days. The rooms have been painted in
a series of panels showing the evolution
of transport. These start with a Garden
of Allah effect—a gently lowing camel
against a pink sunset —and end with a
symbolic conflict between man and
machinery, in which the mascot on the
bonnet of the Vauxhall triumphantly
leads the way into the twentieth century.
The merriest of the decorations shows a
park in the gay ’nineties with a be-waisted
lady in the aesthetic greeny-yallers of the
period. On her frontispiece is a huge
brooch in which artist Woodward Smith
has enshrined his own face. Near by are
two dashing soldiers, a bird carolling
“Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay” and a sporty
looking person exercising an ancient car.
Sedan chairs, Greek and Roman chariots,
flying machines, gas balloons, bicycles,
buffalo-carts and the Rocket all career
madly after one another through the
centuries in the most amusing and spirited
way.
The Kelso King charm and a contralto
voice of cream-and-honey sweetness are
the gifts of Hazel, the young daughter of
the Quambi household. Hazel is off to
Europe in December to get a final polish
on the voice which the Bennett Norths
have trained so satisfactorily along the
local course. Before leaving Sydney the
singer will give a recital in the Savoy.
Then she and brother Nicholas cross to
San Francisco, where the two will pay
a round of visits before Hazel goes on
her way via Panama and Nicholas
returns home. Photo, from Rene Pardon.
The potter, the spinner and the weaver
sat at their wheels and looms, and the
Education Department galleries justified
their name, for if you watched hard and
twitched your ears as attentively as the
fluffy Angora rabbit in his green hutch
you could learn how wool can be spun,
fabrics woven and pottery made. The
Arts and Crafters were very earnest over
their demonstration last week, and if at
any moment the quickness of their hands
deceived the onlooker’s eye, a civil ques-
tion would bring a detailed answer.
Carmina was the name of the white
rabbit that came to this party, and he
sat close by Miss E. Andrew, who was
busily spinning the coats of his brethren
into wool. Grace Burrows, one of the
pioneer rabbit-fur farmers of Australia,
talked knowingly on the care of the
bountiful bunny. C. J. Hopper’s rug-
making was an interesting exhibit.
When the Impressionist group intro-
duces “Cyrano de Bergerac,” Adele
Quinn will be the lovely ”and greatly
loved Roxane. Adele, who began her
theatrical work with the Turret Theatre,
has a lengthy and varied repertoire, and
has appeared as Milne, Shaw, Maughan,
Barrie, Sardou and Sutro heroines. She
broadcasts from the National stations,
has been heard in Gladys Cooper and
Irene Vanbrugh parts, and has appeared
with Eric Coleman, brother of world-
famed screen man Ronald. Her Roxane
will be played to John Gould’s Cyrano
at the Royal early next month. Photo-
graph by Falk.
Nell Donahoe, just back in Manly
after her trip to Europe, has a pretty
story to tell of the war cemeteries of
France. They bloom, weedless and
flowerful, like private gardens. In the
section where the Australians who fell at
Pozieres lie at rest Miss Donahoe sought
the graves of some cousins ; close to the
entrance her gaze was arrested by a little
mound, more vivid with flowers, if pos-
sible, more shiningly cared for, than its
neighbors. The white cross above it bore
only the words: “Known to God Alone.”
A little distance off the Sydney visitor
found the grave of her kinsmen. Its
centre was thick with yellow pansies, and
bordering it were pink and red rambler
roses. Visitors are not allowed to pluck
so much as a petal, but, after consulta-
tion with the officials, seven pansies were
allowed to be picked for this so-far-away
Australia.
Sydney has achieved a woman doctor
of dentistry—Elsie Wearn, who returned
by the Strathnaver. She has plumbed
the gums of America, England and the
Continent, and has specialised in the
diseases that attack the tooth pasturage.
Dr. Elsie is taking up her work at the
Rachel Forster and at the Langton Clinic.
G. B. Lancaster was the guest of honor
at the Friday luncheon of the Lyceum
Club. Replying to Elizabeth Allan’s wel-
come and Mary Gilmore’s praise, she
gave it as her opinion that Aussie writers
had a much better chance of selling their
wares in the American market than else-
where. She has found Americans con-
siderably interested in Australia and
anxious to learn about us.
Bulletin writer Henrietta Drake-
Brockman, author of “Blue North” and
“Men Among Pearls,” is over from the
West. Young and fair, with a vivid, vital
personality, Mrs. Drake-Brockman left
her husband and two babies in Cottesloe
while she packed a bag in a hurry and
caught the Trans, express to have a look
at Sydney. Novels, short stories, articles
and plays all trip from the pen of the
versatile lady, whose one regret on reach-
ing Sydney was that she was too late to
meet S. H. Prior, who accepted her first
novel.
The Society of Women Writers coo-eed
Iris Downing, of the London “News-
Chronicle,” to its midday meal last Wed-
nesday, and persuaded this quiet little
scribe, who is doing a world tour on
the Ulysses, to tell them something of
the make-up of her section. Iris, in a
caped frock and a wide'hat, the color
of Chinese jade, talked of color sections
and features, and afterwards had a word
on the drama, the novel and publicity
with various of the local sisterhood who
asked for the latest communique from
London.
A girl just back from London called
on this Letter wearing a small black vel-
vet hat on tam-o’-shanter lines. This
dipped over the right eye and had a white
velvet upstanding bow. She declared it is
just out of the designer’s box, and in this
same box are berets with ear-flaps, turned-
down plates of hats, elf hats with one ear,
and hats with two tall ears, like a rabbit’s.
They are made in silky felt, furry felt and
velvet, sleek or ribbed. Colored gloves
are worn with evening frocks, and are
made in velvet and moire ; all the best
after-seven-o’clock dresses swish fishtail
trains. Evening coats are long, cling to
the figure and are much befurred. Com-
position colored bangles are worn, always
in fours, by day and night. Skirts by day
are creeping higher.
The latest London illustrated papers
show a picture of tenor John McCor-
mack with daughter Gwendolyn outside
the Brompton Oratory just before she
became Mrs. Edward Pyke. Gwen was
in Sydney with her parents on John’s last
tour, when the family had a house at
Darling Point. She was then a dark-
haired little girl with her father’s ready
smile and a pretty habit of curtseying
when shaking hands with the friends of
the family. John’s singing was a feature
of the wedding ceremony.
Latvia celebrated the 15th anniver-
sary of its independence last week, and
on Saturday the Consular Norman
McLeods held a reception at the Pick-
wick Club. Natives of the little country
beside the Baltic came from as far away
as Mittagong, and there was a great re-
union seasoned with folksong. One song
of many verses, in which the whole com-
pany joined at supper-time, gave the
healthy advice that it was better to set
about doing a little thing than to wait
for great things to come along. There
was another, “impossible to translate—
like your three blind mice,” explained
one of the company. Then there was a
merry one that kept everybody singing
full blast while the photograph was being
taken —a lengthy business this, necessi-
tating the man at the left end of the
front row holding a lighted candle.
Mrs. Norman McLeod, who supported
her tall husband, wore a soft white satin
frock topped by a little fitting plaid
organdie coat with puffed sleeves. Pianist
Carl Budden Morris added Chopin and
Beethoven to the night’s melody. Charles
Nicis, just back from his Wagnerian
broadcasts in Melbourne, allied his tenor
notes to Latvian, German and French
words. Lute Drummond, in tearose-pink
satin, turned a deft hand to accompani-
ments. A piece of amber from the Baltic
State inscribed in the Latvian for “Hap-
piness” was Mrs. McLeod’s souvenir of
the night.

Chatter
The weather imps grinned maliciously
and turned the clouds upside down on
Saturday. Thousands who had hoped for
some thrills at the Test-trial cricket
match disconsolately turned up their
collars and paddled home after watch-
ing an hour’s play. At Kooyong the
championship tennis had to be aban-
doned and riders and horses were mud-
spattered at the Heidelberg Horse Show.
Another event to be marred was
P.L.C.’s Old Collegians’ garden party,
which metamorphosed into an indoor
function. The association’s most youth-
ful president so far, Kathleen Stobie —she
is a daughter of an old collegian—re-
ceived in an ice-blue gown and hat and
a bunch of red roses. Mr. and Mrs.
Gray, Mrs. I. H. Mirams, with a black-
and-white osprey wound round her
throat, and knight John MacFarland sat
among the peonies which bloomed upon
the stage. Mrs. I. H. Moss, the brilliant
Dr. Jean Macnamara, Miss J. Paterson
and Miss H. Hailes were among those
who sipped tea —it was handed round by
girls hopefully dressed for tennis. A
band of pipers gave the party a Scot-
tish flavor. After the rain stopped they
skirled round the old elm-tree, venerable
friend of three generations of school girls.
(Kilties must be pocketless, for one of the
lads had his pipe stuck in one sock
and his baccy in the other.) The present
girls’ handcraft deserves a mention. It
was displayed upstairs and came smiling
through the minutest scrutiny. Weaving
is a specialty. A skirt of beautifully soft
texture was one of the exhibits.
The Air Force zoomed off to Ormond
Hall to dance another layer into the edu-
cational trust fund inaugurated by the
Air Force Officers’ Wives and Mothers’
Association. Complexions looked their
best in such seductive lighting. Twinkly
globules swayed from overhead festoons
and little lighthouses sprang up in alcove
and annex. Everybody wore caps, and
balloons, which escaped, sailed up to the
roof, to stay there till some cleaner or
electrician goes aloft to a job of work.
Air-Commodore Goble’s cap was bright
green and shaped like a jockey’s; his
wife wore black sprinkled with steel
beads round the yoke. Mrs. Eric Harri-
son audited the accounts in a cloud of
cafe-au-lait silk net; her Wing-Com-
mander, who has auburnish locks, sal-
lied forth gravely in a scarlet witch’s hat.
Mrs. Shepherd chose the severity of
black velvet; Mrs. V. E. Hancock was
another all-black. Wing-Commander
Wrigley, in a purple feather headpiece,
brought his petite wife, in cream laces
tied with sapling-green velvet.
Mrs. A. H. Cobby was blue-clad like
her sister Joyce. Patou-pink tulle swirled
round Mrs. Tony Carr. Squadron-leaders
Lukis and Hepburn had caps representing
respectively a garden in spring and a
cannibal. Mrs. Lukis caught her ice-blue
satin corsage with brilliant brooches to
match her twinkly earrings. Pat Watson’s
lilac frock broke into wispy apertures
of green and white. Nancy Angwin was
an all-black attraction, and Florence
Counsell dipped a brush into her paints
for the fuschias and foliage which grew
round the hem of her white organza.
Tall Miss de Crespigny trailed mushroom
velvet and a black organdie coatee with
pinwheel sleeves. There was a buffet
supper and the bar’s merry trade put a
lot of extra coin in the coffers.
The English tennis team and represen-
tative players from other States were
given their first official welcome at
Kooyong. In between nibbling salads and
listening to a few brief speeches guests
murmured all the right things about the
lovely green valley which unfurls itself
from the clubhouse verandah. H. A.
Pitt, with the help of Mrs. J. M. Robert-
son and Helen Sage, did the honors. The
association, by the way, has decided that
there is nothing improper about nude
knees, and shorts may be worn by both
sexes. If the knobby, the bandy and the
bow are determined to uncover them-
selves —well it’s their funeral.
Everybody who went out to Egalabra,
the Charles Cunninghams’ home in
Kooyong-road, seemed to have plenty of
money to spend. Coins rattled through
house, verandah and garden throughout
the afternoon and evening. Melbourne
Hospital and St. Martin’s Boys’ Home
benefited. There were all the usual things
to buy and drooping spirits sought re-
juvenation with “sidecars” and “body-
lines” in the cocktail bar. You could
have many things to eat on little tables
under the trees and blow foam from
a tankard in the German Beer Garden.
Some of Melbourne’s most-talked-of girls
displayed the newest beach wear in the
sea-nymph parade, which wound up in a
gambol with the most fashionable beach
toys and the hostess’s dog. Dancing filled
in the evening for the younger fry.
Mrs. Malcolm Hamilton and daughter
Peggy invited their friends to soar aloft
to the Quamby Club for tea, bridge and
chatter. Peggy, who is concentrating on
cold-weather clothes for her trip Fog-
wards, snatched the opportunity of a fine
day for a flowered foulard and an airy-
white hat. Betty Black, Joyce Gardiner
and a bunch of Joans —Black, Hamilton,
Tolman, Govett and Anderson —were
among the players.
Three thousand guests, most of them
on the tender side of 14, had an orgy
of ice-cream, peanuts and the circus.
Philip Wirth was host, and the kiddies
were provided by the F.U.S.W.M. and
the Legacy Club. The Irvine lady, who
brought a small grandson, spoke a word
of thanks from the arena.
Here is Jean Campbell, whose first
novel, “Brass and Cymbals,” makes its
ddbut upon the bookstalls this month.
Jewish people have always interested the
young writer, and the color of her book
is provided by their religion and cus-
toms. Miss Campbell confesses to the
perpetration of a full-length novel during
her schooldays. Its title was “Plato the
Impossible.” It was inscribed in a series
of exercise-books and confidently pro-
claimed the impossibility of platonic
friendship; it was returned from a
novel competition for having exceeded
the word limit. Miss Campbell has also
written plays, and is now immersed in
her second novel. Broothorn photo.
Kathleen Moore and Captain W. N.
Tinsley embarked upon their matrimonial
partnership in Christ Church, South
Yarra, against a background of khaki,
spurs and swords. The dull-surfaced
white wedding garment sprung a cape
edged with kolinsky, velvet ribbon
wreathed the crown of her airy tulle hat
and white and blush-pink peonies were
clustered upon one arm. Mrs. Larry
Heath attended as her sister’s matron-
of-honor. Her misty-blue georgettes went
with navy millinery and a handful of
delphiniums. Mrs. Charles Moore pre-
sided over tea and toast at Tara, Toorak.
The bride is keen on sport and a glitter-
ing star at ski-ing. She has three times
been Australian champion, and a share
of glory came her way at Innsbruck.
The Clive Baillieus celebrated the en-
gagement of daughter June and Sam
Hordern with a dance at Kamillaroi. The
affair was impromptu, but telephone calls
rounded up nearly 100 guests. The
hostess beamed her blessings in ebony
chiffons. June was glittersome in metal
tissue and Mary wrapped herself in ivory
crepe jerselli.
During the first few years of Tynan’s
estate agency’s existence clients expected
to find a man behind its desk. It wasn’t
until well ensconced in their chairs that
they discovered the head of the firm was
Miss Tynan. In her first month as a
business woman, Miss Tynan sold a
£20,000 slice of Collins-street property.
The lady likes dealing with Big Fish who
know what they want. It is smaller fry
who present difficulties. They have
several looks at the flat-to-let, bring their
tape measure, decide in which corner the
palm and pedestal will look their best,
ask for time to bring mother along, and
then vanish completely. Broothorn made
the portrait.
A packed audience nearly lifted the
roof of the King’s with its approval of
“The Student Prince.” Gorgeous Sylvia
Welling, as Kathie, old friend Cecil Kel-
laway, as Lutz, Shirley Dale, as the
princess, and Lorna Forbes, alternately
swooning and being a snorting dragon,
all got salvoes of clapping, but John
Dudley’s was positively deafening. At the
final curtain Miss Welling climbed over
the barrage of flowers to say “Good boy,
John!” (he had learned the prince’s
exacting part in six days) and drop a
kiss in the vicinity of his cheek-bone.
Gladys Moncrieff, wearing black and a
spray of white camellias, was in the stalls.
She had her triumph the previous night
at the Royal.
Melbourne is making its formal calls
upon the new Rembrandt and “Cleo-
patra’s Feast” which have come to live
in the National Gallery under the terms
of the Felton Bequest. The Rembrandt
self-portrait, which depicts an old man,
very poor and friendless, has gazed out
of the canvas since 1660. The size of
the Tiepolo painting attracts the interest
of swarms of small boys who scamper
through the galleries every day for a
look at Phar Lap in the museum. Cleo-
patra, born 69 8.c., appears somewhat
unexpectedly with wasp-waist and Medici
collar. She is on the point of dissolving
one of her pearl earrings in vinegar. This
unpalatable potion she swallows, thus
winning her wager with Antony of pro-
viding a meal worth £150,000.
A young Melbourne matron has an
optimistic habit of parking her sedan
long and oft in the city’s busiest thor-
oughfares, and her better half is appre-
hensive about fines. After taking two
hours to buy a little hat the lady sprinted
across the street and took a flying leap
into her car as the leg of the Law planted
a big boot on the step. “Now I’ve got
yez,” said the Law, and out of his pocket
came a doomful-looking book. “Will
ye be buying a ticket for the police car-
nival?” She bought a dozen.
Perth frolics through its summer: —
Wide-brimmed hats shielded feminine race-
goers from the rays of a broiling sun at the
W.A.T.C. meeting, and kindly elms threw a
shade over tote ticket-takers. Dorothy Balston
punted in flimsy florals; Edna Smily’s soft
muslin was powder blue; Mary Main’s crisp
maize linen moved about the lawns next to Mrs.
Percy Wickham’s navy suitings; Mrs. Wunder-
lick’s magnolia ribouldinge was belted and
basqued and topped by a scarlet headpiece, and
a glimpse of Mary Padbury’s water-lily-green-
and-white voile was cooling.
The Royal Artillery barracks resounded to
strains from the regimental band, the tapping
of slippers and the clicking of spurs. Major
and Mrs. Meredith were in the box seat, her
cloudy effect emanating from atmosphere-grey
lace.
Karrakatta Club members gathered to the
scent of golden broom, roses and gladioli.
Retiring president Mrs. S. J. Anderson, in ebony
panne velvet, smiled welcomes beside her suc-
cessor, Mrs. F. G. Dempster, who mingled
black lace with georgette. Zoe Lenegan, Jean
Herbert, Allan Gamble and Robert Gibson pro-
vided musical fare.
Fragile bits and pieces were carried care-
fully to Mt. Lawley and bestowed on Gladys
McDaniell at Pat and Kath Davies’s china tea.
The bride-elect had wisps of fur adhering to her
pink georgette.
A fly-away green-and-pink bow was perched
on Mrs. Cecil Mason’s flowered silks when she
received L.A.B. Music Club members at the
Karrakatta Club hall. The musical programme
and supper were served in apartments made gay
by carnations and a riot of broom.
Florence Besley, a footlight favorite with
Repertorians, played main role at a St. George’s
Cathedral ceremony with Atholl Macgregor as
leading man. Bridal rosebuds nestled against
cornflower-blue matalasse roofed with blue tagel
straw. ’Groom’s sister Jessie followed, striped
diagonally in red and white and hatted with
white cellophane. The A. J. Simons couple, she
in violet furbishings, spread the table at their
Mt. Lawley home.
The Alf Oakleys came down from their Car-
narvon station to find Ken McGibbon on the
doorstep of their Peppermint Grove home wait-
ing to ask for daughter May’s hand in marriage.
The ring now flashes.
The Orsova brought Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy
Withnell back from a health trip spent in the
Cold Country. Passing through Fremantle on
the same ship were Vice-Admiral A. F. Beal
and his wife and Major and Mrs. B. N. W.
William-Powlett.
A few lines from Adelaide: —
To help the Stirling District Hospital there
was a bazaar at St. Wilfrid’s, Aldgate, the
beautiful garden of the late Francis Snow:
Hundreds motored from the city, and purveyors
of afternoon tea were kept busy. Mrs. H. S.
Hudd launched the effort. Boy Scouts patrolled
the garden to see that nobody picked the
flowers, and the Mount Lofty Girl Guides ran
a produce stall.
The Liberal Women’s Educational Associa-
tion had a party to celebrate its 21st birthday.
H. S. Dunk presented a cake with 21 candles.
The Butler lady, a foundation member, pro-
posed the toast of the association.
The Britten-Jones-Gunson wedding was cele-
brated at St. Francis Xavier’s Cathedral. The
bride was a graceful figure in ivory bubble
crepe, cut on close-fitting lines, and worn with
a wide-brimmed white straw hat. She carried
a shower bouquet of white flowers. Ruth
Gunson, her sister, was bridesmaid, frocked in
a soft, pale pink wi.h a large straw hat and
posy to match. Dr. R. Mahon Glynn sup-
ported bridegroom Dr. Alan Britten-Jones.
Altar and chancel were decked with pink
gladioli and Madonna lilies.
Mrs. H. S. Hudd entertained a number of
friends at the Queen Adelaide Club in honor
of Mrs. F. Burt and her daughter Anne, who
have been Mrs. Hudd’s guests at Glenelg. They
are going to Melbourne before returning to

Hobart Repertory Soc. came to grips with
Sean O’Casey’s “Juno and the Paycock” at

for the week-end enjoyed their experience.
Weather was fair, except for a few hours of
head wind, and some of the passengers did the*

Dr. H. Nairn Butler headed the list of the

“M.G.S.”: The current show of por-
traiture at the Meldrum Gallery is all
electric-light painting, and, logically
enough, is displayed under the same illu-
mination as that by which the pictures
were painted. The realistic painter loves
to solve new problems, and Messrs. Mel-
drum, Jorgensen and Colahan, each in
his degree, have gone some distance in
the direction of solving this problem. In
the presence of these six portraits, as in
the presence of the Rembrandt, one does
not think of paint but of living person-
ages, and, in the case of the Jorgensen
self-portrait, Colahan’s self-portrait and
Meldrum’s portrait of his brother, the
impression is profound. Another example
of contemporary conservatism is the
complaint that these pictures don’t go
far enough, yet the Rembrandt picture is
only a sketch, and one critic is of the
opinion that the master probably painted
it in two hours.
Amidst an avalanche of art shows in
Melbourne this paper caught a glimpse
of the water-colors of James F. Farrell
at the Soho. Mr. Farrell is the only
tram conductor in Melbourne who has
ever held a one-man exhibition, and, if
his art isn’t up to the standard of the
professional brush-wielder, it shows a
praiseworthy desire to spend his leisure
profitably. At Kurrajong House the
Misses Ogilvie and Montgomery reveal
refined taste in color-prints and etchings,
with an occasional spasm of genuine
observation. Marguerite Mahood, Mel-
bourne’s most industrious potter, has a
vast array of glazed figures, pierced and
filigree earthenware and handicraft pot-
tery at Everyman’s. She has a flair for
delicate hues, but her forms lack variety.
The Englishman Harold Latham, whose
wife is an Australian, is once more up
for inspection at the Sedon Galleries,
Elizabeth-street. His water-colors lack
the consistency of the local Harold Her-
bert, but occasionally, as in “Early
Morning, St. Pol,” hit off an effect with
the neatness of that practitioner.
Critics of James Flett’s latest show at
the Rookwood Gallery, Melbourne, are
indebted to the artist for some remarks
about themselves which are worth quot-
ing: “Almost every artist eventually ex-
presses himself by falling into line with
convention, however plausibly he may
hide it from himself. The critic —the
appointed one to reach art from the
slough—is actually in league with his fel-
lows in condoning their weaknesses.”
This is only too true, both as regards
artists and critics, and Mr. Flett is an
example. He echoes the conventions of
Blamire Young and Norman Lindsay.
“M.G.S.”: There is no sentimentality
about Ernest Buckmaster (Fine Arts,
Melbourne). He puts things down as he
sees them. Often he sees them in terms
of melodrama. Although in every land-
scape he strains after variety of effects,
his hard, bright, barnstorming style
gives an impression of monotony.
There are the elements of a good picture
in “Grey Winter,” where the subject—
swimming mists —has had a gentling
effect on his swashbuckling brush, but
for the most part his large panoramic
views suggest the photograph in colors
inviting Mr. Clapp’s customers to see the
vista “70 miles from Melbourne by rail.”
“Rev. F. A. Hagenauer, M.A.,” is a good
likeness, but the battling ecclesiastic who
expects to find Communists under every
flat stone has been arrayed in a suit of
tin.
At the Australian Fine Art Gallery,
Sydney, there is a show of water-colors
by Tom Garrett, a painter well calculated
to arouse the worst of passions in the
breasts of the modernists. His work has
all the definiteness, combined with deli-
cacy, of the very best of the old-
fashioned steel engravings. If they could
have made color-prints in that medium,
that is the way the masters of the craft
would have liked them to look. Some of
Garrett’s pictures give an effect of mono-
chrome ; some appear to be in tones of
two nearly-related colors, and others are
in full polychrome, but all are delight-
ful. The painter sees poetry in the out-
crop of red-roofed houses amid the
forests that fringe Sydney; has found
sylvan solitude and romance in Kuring-gai
Chase (it’s there, of course, but few
painters seem to have guessed it), and
has discovered an old farmhouse on the
crest of a rise that makes a silhouette
expressing in color the sort of fantastic
atmosphere that only Poe has crystallised
in words. Garrett loves old houses;
bricks mellowed by a century of sun and
rain ; such pathetic relics of gentility as
imposing gateways that now lead to a
wilderness of weeds. In such pictures as
“The Playground” he limns gum-trees
as Corot might have done. All very
artificial and conventional, doubtless, but
these pictures make a strong appeal.
“M.G.S.”: This year’s three A’s show at
the Athenaeum was the weightiest display
the leading art organisation of Melbourne
has yet provided. John Longstaff’s staid
full-length of Miss Janet Hitchman satis-
fies all the requirements of orthodox port-
raiture and W. B. Mclnnes’s “Rev. W.
Brown” runs it a good second. The nudes
of Bernard Hall and disciple Charles
Wheeler look as if they would be all the
better for fur coats. A. D. Colquhoun has
dealt sympathetically with his mother,
but Ernest Buckmaster’s “Miss H. M. E.
Bale” has the rigidity of a photograph.
Justus Jorgensen’s self-portrait dominated
the show, despite the bad light it was
placed in. It has the reality of an actual
presence, as also has Colin Colahan’s
“The Purple Gown.” The Rowell
brothers contributed some passages of
light that have merit. John D. Moore
sent from Sydney a conventional design
of three figures and some tin clouds.
Wallace Anderson’s “Eve” is as like
flesh as marble is. On the whole the
statuary fell far below the standards
attained to by the best of the pigmentists.


Miraģe
BY E. MARY GURNEY.
OUT of the vast, uncanny stillness of
the night-quiet hills a small wind
woke suddenly, crying in the tree-
tops, and as suddenly was still.
Beneath the ragged, overhanging
branches the Jersey bull, Pride of Innes-
frae, blew sharply through his nostrils,
shaking his fine head and moving un-
easily, so that his polished hoofs rustled
the dry bracken.
A moment ago he had been drows-
ing, but now he was fully roused and
shaken with a trembling ecstasy born of
that passing wind.
Never in his four years had he known a
night like this. Through the interlacing
branches the moon was a burning disc
of silver radiance, so that he stood
caught in a network of cleanly-etched
shadows that quivered on his body when
he moved. From beneath his feet the
parched, dusty earth and trampled
bracken gave off a scent of poignant
sweetness. All along the shadowed val-
ley the air rose in languid strata, chok-
ingly dry from the places where the last
kiss of the sun had lingered, tinged with
a dream of dew from the hidden bottom
where, even at high, noontide, the sear-
ing rays were forbidden. But every
breath of it was pungent with the rotten,
earthy scent of virgin bush and bracken
that had known the sun for countless
generations of men.
Innesfrae lowered his head and snorted
again. He moved leisurely from the lat-
ticed shade into the broad moonlight and
stood poised on a little rocky pinnacle
that overhung the valley.
The night was very still, as though the
earth itself was wrapped in profoundest
slumber. Across the valley the bare
crest of a hill was etched in silver against
the solid midnight blue of the sky. North
and south, its harsh outline melted into
the moonlight, unbroken except where,
just opposite, the mighty crown of a
solitary tree rose sharply from black
shadow and pointed a tremulous finger
at the moon.
Like a beast carven in stone the
bull stood, his head upflung, his little
red eyes fixed unwinkingly on that shim-
mering finger. Only his nostrils moved,
and his flanks lifted almost impercept-
ibly as he snuffed inquiringly at the
heady night air.
But, though he stood motionless as
if caught in the dreaming hush that
had descended on the world, unlike the
rest of the world he was wideawake
and filled with a curious sense of abound-
ing life, almost as though for the first
time he knew that he lived. His heart
thundered against his ribs, and his whole
being quivered with an intoxicating sense
of power.
This world that slept at his feet, igno-
rant of the sudden crowning of its new
king, must awake forthwith and salute
him.
His tail twitched suddenly, lifted and
lashed his flanks. He lowered his head,
snorting and stamping and tearing the
earth; he knelt, rubbing his shining
horns and rattling them against the
rock. A loose piece fell away and went
bounding and leaping down the hillside
until it crashed into the massed treetops
below.
Innesfrae stood up, shaking his head
and grunting; and the sleeping world
was shocked into wakefulness by his
sudden, tempestuous bellowing that rang
from peak to peak, leaping from the
rugged crests, until, far away, it died in
the heart of the primordial hills.
As the last harsh notes soared to their
death a deeper silence seemed to enfold
the world. It was no more the silence
of sleeping, but a silence pregnant with
expectation.
Innesfrae, drunk with the radiant
beauty of the night, was gloriously aware
of the tense vibrancy that his insolent
challenge had awakened.
For some seconds he stood still, as the
world was still when the last eerie echoes
of_his call died ; but, though he listened
in utter immobility, no other sound came
back.
A little gust of anger dimmed his
exhilaration, and he bellowed again,
breaking off suddenly to snort indig-
nantly as the little, lost echoes fled dis-
consolately from valley to hill.
Of what avail to know yourself lord
of creation when, at your challenge, that
creation merely sighs as it turns over,
composing itself afresh for slumber?
Now Innesfrae tore at the earth that
had cradled him, lashing his tail the
while and sending forth peal after peal
of roaring that was a profanation of the
holy quiet of the night. When again
he paused to listen, faint and far away
came an answering challenge from his
kind.
Not from the valley behind the ridge
on which he stood, where his own herd
slept in the burnt-out paddocks, but from
the valley beyond the opposite ridge,
which stood out like a silver cameo
against the deep arc of the sky.
Twice again Innesfrae roared his chal-
lenge-triumph tinged with anger that
there should exist even one member of
his own kind foolhardy enough to ques-
tion the supremacy that had crowned
him this shining night. Then, grunting
and snorting, he turned and made his
way from the pinnacle, passing from the
moonlight, back into the dimness of the
bush. In a few seconds the sound of
his going died out, and the hillside was
washed again with a radiant peace that
was checkered with shadow.
Half an hour later a moving shadow
detached itself from the inky shadow of
the valley, and emerged on the jagged,
silver-gilt hilltop beside the shimmering
tree.
Innesfrae stood listening. His shadow,
thrown down into the valley below him,
was grotesque and motionless as the
shadows of the trees, but on the high,
bare crest, though there was no cool-
ness, there was almost a tang in the air,
so that the bush-pungent odors of the
valley were flat by comparison.
Innesfrae peered into the depths at his
feet. His flanks were heaving and his
muzzle was flecked with foam, for he
had travelled fast whose journeyings,
until to-night, had consisted of a leis-
urely progress from field to bail and back
again with his cows.
And until to-night it had not occurred
to him that wire fences were but so much
string before the power of his great
shoulders. True, one singing strand had
snapped back and scored a bloody weal
across his glossy flank, but no wire would
dare touch him again! And the sting
of that encounter had fanned the flame
of his fighting lust to fever heat, so that
he pawed the earth and broke from a
muttering grumble into a series of grunt-
ing roars that filled the night with pul-
sating expectation.
The echoes had not died before the
deep-mouthed answer came ringing up
from the shadowy side of the hill.
Innesfrae tossed his foam-flecked head
and lunged forward. His little eyes
glinted with dull fire, ruby-bright in the
silver glow. His mouth ran saliva, and
he sobbed with eagerness, grunting with
every jump that carried him down to-
wards the shadows where the challenger
of his supremacy waited.
He crashed through a drift of manuka
into a bed of stinging nettles eight feet
high, ploughed head down, tail high
through bracken that topped the nettles,
and found himself caught in a tangle of
brush that resisted his progress with the
tenacity of a sensate thing.
With slobbering bellows, his rage
mounting at every step, he fought his
way onward, and broke suddenly back
into the open,- where the moonlight
streamed on a little round hill.
The gentle slope of it was dotted all
over with watching cows. They stood im-
mobile, knee-deep in the dark pools of
their own shadows.
Innesfrae halted, head and tail high-
held, and stared back. Cows they were,
most surely, but not cows as he knew
them. These were gigantic red beasts
as big as himself. They had white heads,
ghostly in the ghostly light, and fierce
eyes, ringed with red, and their mighty
horns branched out and upwards in a
glorious widespread sweep.
Innesfrae snorted, and somewhere
near him the snort was answered by a
titanic blast that made him bellow as he
swung.
Two paces from him stood another
of the red beasts ; but, if the cows were
large, Red Conqueror of Forbidden Val-
ley was a mammoth of his kind.
He towered over his challenger as a
mountain dominates a hill. Beside his
massive, sculptured beauty, Innesfrae
was dwarfed into an insignificance that
made him look almost dainty and effem-
inate.
Grumbling a trifle to himself, the levia-
than moved ponderously forward, blink-
ing almost benignly at his little rival.
His monstrous head was white and his
eyes, unusually large and luminous, were
set in irregular patches of dark red, so
that their rich brown looked even darker
than it was. His horns of polished ivory
stood straight out on either side of his
head, not long, but thick at the base as
a man’s thigh, and tapered to shining
black points that were javelin-keen.
When he moved, the silver light glinted
on them, running from base to tip, as
the light of flames runs over steel.
His withers stood high as a tall man,
and the thews of his tremendous shoul-
ders rippled under his hide, huge and
knotted as steel ropes. His loins were
lean and magnificent, and he stood
squarely on his great white hoofs,
serenely confident that there had yet to
be born the bull who could menace his
authority.
Innesfrae bellowed suddenly.
He was not exactly afraid, but when
he had set out hot-footed over the hill
to conquer the world he had never im-
agined anything like this. One of his
own breed, older than he, bigger, more
powerful; but he had no thought of
drawing back.
It is the tragedy of beasts caught in
the urge of the blood-lust that once their
challenge goes out they are too stupid
to retreat in the face of superior odds.
Innesfrae bellowed again, lowering his
proud head and pawing the hard turf.
The dust went up in little spurts that
hung like tiny clouds on the still air.
Red grunted, shaking his head and
backing away, all too plainly intimating
that he had no quarrel with so insigni-
ficant a foe ; but Innesfrae, with a roar
of outraged dignity, flung himself for-
ward in a headlong charge.
With a sound that was curiously like
a sigh, the huge Hereford lowered his
ghostly head.
On the hillside the cows blared sud-
denly, leaping, with their blotched
shadows racing with them, and plunging
down the hill, holding their tails high
and kicking up their heels as they surged
down with ungainly speed towards the
combatants.
So fierce was Innesfrae’s charge that
the force of the impact rocked the stand-
ing giant. For a second the tips of the
Jersey’s horns rattled against the huge
bases of the Hereford’s. Then slowly
but inevitably Innesfrae gave ground.
As he went he sobbed with impotent
rage, striving to break free, so that he
might drive forward again and endeavor
to pierce with his short, formidable horns
his enemy’s great skull.
To gain his end he gave ground
suddenly, but Red blundered forward,
bearing him down. The point of Innes-
frae’s horn grazed the Hereford’s neck,
but with no more than a little grunt
Red drew away'and stood blinking curi-
ously at the fallen pigmy.
Round them the curious, excited cows
ringed, frisking heavily and snorting, and
occasionally emitting idiotic “blahs” of
enjoyment.
Innesfrae lumbered to his feet and
charged again. This time the Here-
ford was ready for him. Deliberately,
with astonishing lightness, he stepped
aside and swung his vast head, ripping
the Jersey neatly from elbow to thigh as
he plunged past.
Innesfrae broke silence with a high,
sobbing bellow of mingled rage and pain.
As he pivoted to return to the attack, he
felt the gush of warm blood spurt from
his riven side, and the anguish of it
whipped him to a rage that wiped out
all reason.
Like a whirlwind he charged, but Red,
braced to meet it, took the full force
of it on his broad forehead, unyielding
as a stone wall; and, against the shining
bases of his horns, the Jersey’s were
snapped off like spikes of glass.
The pain was excruciating, but not for
a second did the crazy beast give ground.
Blood poured down his face, blinding
him, and the hot smell of it was hateful
in his nostrils. The salt of it was on his
lips, and the stain of it dyed Red’s head
from horn-base to muzzle, so that he
snorted with sudden anger and lunged
forward with all his stupendous weight.
Before the onslaught, Innesfrae was
powerless as a child in the hands of a
giant. He slithered back and back,
went to his knees and rolled over.
Red blundered on to him and over him,
trampling him so that he roared with the
agony of the huge hoofs that cut like
knives.
Red stumbled free and swung, snort-
ing and slashing the earth. His face was
dyed an awful scarlet, and he was mon-
strous and heart-shakingly terrible in the
eerie light. The smell of the hot blood
had roused in him the savage lust of his
wild forebears, the lust to kill.
Yet inherent in him was a nobility that
stayed him from goring his fallen foe.
Waiting for Innesfrae to rise, he tore
the earth, and the thunder of his
primeval rage shook the hills to their
foundations; but Innesfrae, exhausted
and heartbroken, lay where he had
fallen, drenched in his own blood.
His body was shattered, though he had
received no mortal hurt. His spirit
was utterly broken. The Red Conqueror
roared again, and trampled the bloody
turf about him, but Innesfrae did not
move. Beyond the heavy rasp of his
breathing, he made no sound.
Presently, with a snort that sounded
like contempt, the old leviathan turned
and left him there, crushed beneath the
double burden of his own pride and folly.
Very slowly the Red Conqueror made
his way to the top of the little round hill,
where he stood quite immobile, in com-
plete disregard of the fatuous triumph of
his cows. The world was still washed in
silver radiance, and it was at his feet,
but for him the fact held curiously little
meaning. If, in the years passed, there
had come to him that sudden realisation
of his power, it was so long since that he
had quite forgotten, and his invincibility
was a fact of small matter to him.
Around him his cows quietened, and
fell to chewing the cud, standing knee-
deep in the dark pools of their own
shadows, and gazing, drowsily curious,
at the victim of their lord’s prowess.
Almost listlessly Red stood, drinking
in the air that cooled towards the dawn.
As the blood dried on his face, his anger
cooled, so that, when at last Innesfrae
moved and struggled to his feet, the Red
Conqueror watched his retreat with
luminous, soft-eyed benignity.
Unobtrusively the Pride of Innesfrae
moved out of the moonlight, back into
the eternal shadows.
The radiance of the night was gone,
and there was a ghostly lightening in the
east.
Out of the vast, uncanny stillness of the
passing dark a small wind woke sud-
denly, crying day to the treetops, and
as suddenly was still.
Horse-chestnuts.
“Make me a song this morning,” says the high
horse-chestnut tree;
“Into a sonnet of beauty weave all my
blossomry.
Make of my music a little round of immortality,
“So one may know, in the winter’s gloom,
stripped by his ruthless vandals,
How beautiful were my boughs in bloom, my
blossomy summer candles
That lit November down the lane in her flower-
dusted sandals.”
But what can I, who have no songs like those
of the singing birds?
Where I would dream of a jewelled stave there
would be but broken sherds;
Never a silver circlet, but only stumbling
words.
Your songs are wind-drawn music that the
harps of faery hear
In the heart of the yellow summer, tremulous,
sweet and clear.
Yourself the perfect poem on the leaves of the
turning year.
VICTORIA.
KATHLEEN DALZIEL.
One Room.
She said “You have one room”; and I replied:
“One room? A hundred!” And I thought of
these:
Of carpets knit of living daffodils;
Of windows that are sky; a frieze of trees;
A dado of dark pansies (summer nights,
Purple, with gold moons at the heart of them);
Of corridors in live nasturtium tints,
Panelled with orange, ochre, cadmium,
Where there is a slim Mercury of bronze
Poised for celestial flight. One room have I?
She has not seen the green hall, lined with moss
And floored with the snow-white of mushrooms,
flushed
In sunset-rose; and she has never seen
My pale cathedral of lost waterfalls,
Where all day long you hear the singing spray
Weaving a siren music round the rocks;
Nor that bright court of wings, where chilla-
wong
And pheasant lurk, and humming-birds are born
Of a great crimson flower, and there are bees,
Dusted with sunshine, and green parrakeets;
Nor columned halls of Egypt, where I keep
(Strange with the scent of ambra) painted eyes
To guard the wanderer in the ways of Death;
Carnelian necklets; faience jars- that hold
Spiced rose-leaves that were plucked in
Pharaoh’s day.
She does not know my lattice in a tower
Looking on the long shining sands of dream,
And where at night the quivering air is filled
With muted birds and unseen opening flowers,
Till from the earth-edge comes the tardy moon,
Spilling her silvers on the trembling sea.
She does not know my many splendid rooms;
My house not made with hands; my gardens
rich
In every bloom that grows in every land;
My jasmine arbor where the Persian sings
Of roses, and of nightingales, and wine;
Nor the stone castle on the wooded hill
Above the little town of steep red roofs,
Whence comes the secret music of a lute;
Nor that grim turret where a lady sits
Before her tabor frame, choosing gay silks
To shape the colors of unlived romance
And hide the heart’s blood on a needle’s point;
Nor the green moat where mist-blue lilies float;
Nor the King’s road that lies across the moor,
Bearing at dawn the standards, stiff with gold,
And, at grey eve, the stained and tattered flag.
She does not know the little hidden path
Among the fire-tipped bracken where we walked,
My love and I, towards the parting ways,
Smelling the bruised bark and the broken
flowers;
The words we might have spoken, powerless
now.
One room? My kingdom reaches to the sea
And back into the centuries’ dust; my key
Unlocks more doors than I can ever find!

The Window.
BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
HE could feel the day about him, feel
himself coming out of sleep into
its radiance. He did not see it
yet; just for this one moment more he
kept his eyes closed. Here was life taking
hold again after the fallow time of sleep,
the “little death” ; sunshine flooded the
room, he knew, the good sunshine deny-
ing the little death. Full of hope and
effort. But —just for this one half-
moment more
This wasn’t like him. Not like James
Talbot, the controlled, cool, ready man
who was never at a loss, nor had
need to beg for half-moments. Facing
this in quietude, he did open his. eyes.
A good room ; orderly, a lightly-bal-
anced design of well-proportioned
windows, of walls and floor and ceiling
running in apt controlled lines of har-
mony. A couple of etchings, a shelf of
gleaming books. A good room. And
the sunshine filled it. Life.
He closed his eyes again, so that he
could open them and see it once more.
That was enough of that. He got out
of bed, wandered over to the jonquil-
colored curtains and pulled them back,
slipped on his bath-robe, paused at the
full-length mirror. A little haggard ; eyes
a bit strained. No —not really ; silly to
imagine it.
At the door he paused again, watching
his hand a moment on the doorknob
before he turned it, and went across the
wide, sunny landing to the bathroom.
The shave, the quick shower, the
strong, steady rubbing-down. Now the
game was under his hand again. In the
mirror he could see the firm, ruddy flesh
of his cheeks and jaw, the grey eyes’
level coolness staring back at him, the
straight hard line of his mouth. Fifty ; a
very good 50 —as good as the jonquil-
colored room and the day.
Yet he paused once more at the room’s
door, looking at his fingers on the handle,
sighed sharply as he turned the handle
and went in.
But that was the last of it. Dressed,
he pulled the handkerchief another
quarter-inch out of his breast-pocket, ran
a searching glance over his reflection
from head to foot, and went downstairs
to breakfast. Down the spacious friendly
landing to the first flight of the wide
stairs, to the turn and the window.
The window was open. He paused
here, too, as every day. From here he
could see the years ; this was Lis peep-
hole on the world. A beautiful window
—much more than the brilliant success
the architect had called it when the reno-
vations to the old house were completed.
You seemed to see from here all the
colored garden that James Talbot had
put in beauty round his home; as far
as you could see it was Talbot’s, it was
true, and it was trim and serene, colored
and full of perfume. But you saw more
than that.
Down in that hollow
Now the dream came back, swift and
sharp as the sound of a gunshot. Himself
standing here at the window in a
shadowy light, half-dusk, half-dawn, the
sound of the gun, the man with the
desperate, desolate face staring up at
him from the flower-bed, the zoom of
the bullet, the awful inpact on his
temple....
Last night he had dreamed it again—
the second time.... So vivid that it had
shaken him out of sleep; so vivid that
he seemed to be enduring it in all
moments 5ti11.... Yet here, with the sun-
light drenching him, it was a nothing.
Or was it?
He smiled at the gay garden, at
Laurie’s saddle-horse in the paddock; it
was a nothing.
Down in that hollow there, beyond the
paddock, the Raynors had had their
place, with their cottage perched up on
the rise. Been there for generations, old
Raynor had told him, donkeys’ years.
There had been a Raynor mixed farm
there ever since the old fool’s grand-
father.... No doubt; but they spoiled
his view from this window, his view of
the belt of trees hiding another tumble-
down cottage, and he got his teeth into it.
It had been a long job, but he bought
the mortgage at last and cleared them
out neck and crop. A deal of squealing
and blubbering from the old man; but
he could see the belt of trees from his
peep-hole.
That completed his view of the years
from here. Behind the belt, bits of the
old township doctor’s cottage still stood,
the struggling, slovenly, poverty-stricken
birthplace and home of this James Tal-
bot. Full of charity and goodness of
heart, that slipshod home with broken
shoes for its feet and sometimes not
enough food. Young James had had
more than enough of it at 16 when he
slipped away to Sydney to an office-boy’s
job and turned his back on all good-
hearted slovens for good.
So there it all was, spread out before
the window. The beginning and the end.
You began behind the trees with bread-
and-jam for tea and father doing three-
quarters of his healing of the sick for
nothing. You came over the wide pad-
docks and the rich hollow the Raynors
had farmed since Noah —until you
kicked them out for your view—to the
color and perfume round the big house
you had thirsted for as a boy in
father’s cut-down trousers. A bigger
house, with another storey on it now.
And this window, with the long flight of
stairs behind you down to the stone-
paved hall and the short flight above you
up to the new rooms, jonquil-colored,
gracious, perfect.... That was where
you ended. At this window giving on
to the years.
He smiled again, settling his shoulders
in the trim coat. Of course it was a
nothing. And he was hungry.
“Can I have the Sunbeam to-day,
dad?” Laurie asked.
“No,” he tpld her, opening the paper.
“Damn.” She handed him a cup of
coffee. “Why?”
“Because I want it —driving to the
office.” He did not look up from the
paper.
“But I’ve got to play tennis at”
He did look up, glancing at her over
the paper but in silence. She flushed,
but also fell silent.
“Oh but, dear,” Mrs. Talbot protested,
“Laurie is going to the Farquhars’ and
the Buick is”
Evenly he turned to her, his face all
cool interest. “Yes —go on,” he invited.
But she took a piece of toast and did
not go on.
Presently he rang for the Sunbeam,
and in an hour was at his table in Pitt-
street reading a letter marked “Personal.”
He rang up the writer of the letter, the
junior partner of his firm of auditors.
“Better come round at once,” he said,
finally.
“No, no mistake,” young Dane said.
“We can’t make a mistake,” he added
half-sadly.
“But old Cookson” Talbot stared
at the glass top of his table. “He’s been
with me twenty years, ever since I cut
loose and set up on my own, Bill.”
“Rotten,” Bill said. “I knew there was
a leakage in those New Hebrides com-
missions as soon as I”
Talbot picked up the office telephone.
“Mr. Cookson? Come to my room, will
you?”
“You needn’t prosecute, you know,”
Bill reminded him. “It’s only ninety
quid and”
“I’ll prosecute. They’ve been trying
to soften me with dreams” —Bill stared
at him —“and I don’t soften very good.
I’ll prosecute”
“Dreams? But look, Mr. Talbot —a
case of this kind cuts both ways. Clients
read it in the papers and wonder how
the office is run, where such leakage is
possible. And”
Mr. Cookson came in. “Yes, sir?”
Talbot leaned back in his chair. “What
made you think you could get away with
it?” he asked.
Cookson’s old precise face was sud-
denly white. He licked his lips but was
silent.
“What did you spend it on?” Talbot
continued.
Cookson came over to the table as Bill
Dane rose and crossed to the window,
turning his back on the room.
“One of my grandchildren had to have
an operation,” old Cookson muttered,
“and then another operation was neces-
sary. ... I asked for a loan —my son is
out of a job—and you refused me.”
“I know. I’ve been watching you ever
since.”
“I can put the money back in time,
Mr. Talbot. I’ve been here a good many
years”....
“No doubt. But you won’t get the
chance.” Talbot took the telephone off
the bracket. “I suppose headquarters is
the nearest station”....
Old Cookson was standing upright
beside the table looking down at Talbot.
“Very well, sir,” he said coldly. “I’ll go
and get my coat.”
At the door he turned, his old white
face staring back at Talbot.
Talbot’s heart missed a beat. The
dream stormed back again—this was the
face of the desperate, desolate man stand-
ing in the flower-bed....
“Get me police headquarters,” he
heard himself telling the switchboard.

Film on Teeth
is Dangerous!
Just look at film under
the microscope
Queer germs live on your teeth.
Science links them to tooth decay,
gum disorders and many other
troubles. Germs are glued to
teeth by an ever-forming film.
11
A
m
This is what the scientist finds
when he analyses film on teeth
■€ A species of Lactobacilli now held
* responsible for tooth decay by
many scientists.
ty A species of Streptococcus Pyogenes
that may get into the blood
through the tissues and cause
serious infection.
yOU don’t
need a micro-
scope to pick out
film-stained teeth.
The naked eye can’t miss them,
for film is ugly and disgusting.
But where the naked eye
sees ugliness, the microscope
sees danger. Magnify film
1,000 times and you will see
living germs of many kinds.
Look especially at those rod-
shaped ones in pairs and groups
—Lactobacilli is their scientific
Latin name.
Destroyers of lovely teeth
Lactobacilli are the “germs of tooth
decay.” They feed on the particles of
food that cling to the teeth. They give
off lactic acid that dissolves the tooth
enamel, then devours the part beneath.
Finally the nerve is reached, causing
abscesses and often serious infection.
Lactobacilli appear in countless num-
bers. In fact, the film scraped from a
single tooth may easily contain millions
of living organisms. The only way
science accepts of removing germs from
; teeth is to remove the protective film-
coat in which they live and multiply.
Film clings stubbornly. It defies all
ordinary ways of brushing. That’s why
Pepsodent laboratories have always cen-
tred their attention on the film-removing
properties of their toothpaste. Now these
scientific laboratories have developed a
new and revolutionary material for re-
moving ugly, stubborn film. It is radically
different from any found in other tooth-
pastes —in composition and in action.
Some toothpastes remove film with
materials so hard that they scratch the
enamel. But the new material in Pepso-
dent is soft—twice as soft as the material
commonly used in dentifrices. What’s
more, it shows extraordinary power in
removing film and giving brilliant polish.
This new cleansing and polishing
material is contained in Pepsodent ex-
clusively.

USE PEPSODENT TWICE A DAY—SEE YOUR DENTIST TWICE A YEAR
Old Cookson closed the door, was
gone.
Bill Dane came over. “Listen, Mr.
Talbot,” he began, “can’t you”
“There’s one thing I can do, and that’s
manage my own —is that headquarters
police?”
A shot rang out. In the stunned silence
that followed Bill Dane stared at Talbot
holding the telephone-receiver until run-
ning footsteps along the corridor broke
the silence.
“Mr. Talbot!” a voice said at the
door. “Mr. Cookson has—shot himself!
We”....
If a defaulting secretary shoots him-
self, it throws a spanner into the works.
You get edgy and nervous, and it can’t
be helped. Naturally, you’re all right
after the thing has died down. Only, at
the time and for a few days after the
shock you must expect to react to it.
The window, for instance, the beauti-
ful window that showed the years so
compactly. In the old days, before the
man with the desolate face said his last
words on earth to you and shot himself
in your offices, you stood at the window
every morning and, in this summertime
of long days, every evening, too. This
was good ; the opening and the close of
the day.
But old Cookson broke this down.
For the first time in thirty years Talbot
found himself dodging something. Softly,
and by degrees, so that he hardly noticed
it himself at first. Took to going to the
club on the way home and having four
whiskies-and-sodas instead of one, which
made it dark by the time he reached
home. Too dark to see anything of the
years from the window ; too dark to do
anything but slip swiftly past the window,
running upstairs to change for dinner.
In the mornings he stood there, as of
old, firm and strong—well, firm and
strong. The window followed him about
during the day— not the dream: the
window —but he often did think of it in-
termittently in the days before the dream.
There was not so much in that. Only,
when he realised that his subconscious
was dodging the window —for what
childish reason only his subconscious
knew—he realised also that he must get
the game in hand again. He had always
been his own master, and he didn’t pro-
pose to change now. Standing at the
window became discipline. Whether he
liked it or not he did it.
This took the potency, the glory out of
the window, leaving sometimes even
moments when you peered among the
flowers in the beds be10w....
Sometimes, too, the evening vision of
the triumphant years couldn’t be man-
aged, however well the game was in
hand. One was tired after the day, and
there might be a shadow of dusk begin-
ning among the flowers or by the hedge.
It was silly to stand there remembering
the desperate face and the zooming bullet,
the awful smack on the temple. So
silly And worse than silly to stand
there forcing yourself not to remember
it; that was a half-acknowledgment that
these idiotic fancies had a potency.
A certain haggardness began to show
in Talbot’s strong, ruddy face ; a faint
uncertainty began to touch his control
of the game.
But young Halliday put the cap on it,
brought all the control back with a rush.
He came diffidently into the boss’s room
with some letters for signature, took them
and didn’t go away.
lalbot looked up. “Well?” he asked.
“Er —Mr. Cookson’s family, sir,” he
began. “We’ve already—passed the hat
round in the office and”....
Young Halliday blushed and floun-
dered under the boss’s gaze.
“Well?” Talbot asked again.
“His granddaughter has to go back
into the hospital and.... We’ve done
what we can but it isn’t enough, sir. His
son is out of a job, and their —well,
they’re pretty desperate”
Talbot laughed. “You mean why don’t
I do something?”
Halliday mistook the laugh. “Yes,”
he said eagerly. “I knew it only wanted
showing to you. The poor kid”
“This is pretty good, Halliday. First
the old man pinches ninety quid ; then
he slips me up at the last minute by step-
ping from under ; and then you come
along and suggest that I should keep the
family! ”
Halliday’s eager smile vanished. But
he had a last shot. “Mr. Cookson was a
very old servant,” he said, “and”
Talbot bent over his table again. “Take
those letters to Miss Stacey for mail,”
he said. “And watch your step.”
That was it —trying to force him into
breaking down. They knew him in the
office, knew that such a request was
waste of time. What had got into the
world?
But it was his own fault. A man got
only what he asked for. They were be-
ginning to feel the softening in him. All
these fancies, these childish imaginings—
he had asked for it. But there’d be no
more of it. He’d see to that. He’d go
back to the window night and day, stand
there like a man
There was a beginning dusk darkening
the flower-beds and the privet hedge—
well, so much the better. Give him
something to chew on.
Behind that belt of trees he had begun,
sometimes hungry—was that a rustling
down there in the darkening flowers?
He peered down, hating himself. No.
Nothing—nothing.
He got out of that, the bread-and-jam
and the second-hand trousers. And
across there, where the dusk was a warm
darkness in the hollow, old Raynor, thou-
sands of Raynor generations, used to
farm—- —
What was that, shuffling down there?
A cat or a dog?
And he used to see this house which
was now his and perfect when he was
a
Z00m....z00m —across the perfume,
the color
G0d.... He lifted his head.
The zooming drove in sharp and hard.
The sudden impact on his temple!
He started back, stumbled, tried to re-
cover, holding his temple—slipped, fell
headlong down the long flight of stairs
to the stone-paved hall, breaking his neck.
His head was twisted curiously, as if he
were looking over his shoulder—like a
bird of prey looking back.
The beetle crawled out of his hair to
cross his forehead.
Snapper-Boat.
BY A. FISHER.
said the skip-
} per, “is not a mug’s game.”
He was standing with the tiller
between his legs ; steering, I observed, by
a slight pressure from either thigh as re-
quired to direct the boat.
A stout, sturdy figure of uncertain age ;
a study in browns: brown hair, brown
eyes, red-brown face ; and clad in a
rather ragged collection of garments, the
outer one fastened with a nail, of many
shades of stained and dirty browns.
“Lots o’ fellows take it on, lose their
little bit o’ cash ; and somebody buys a
cheap boat! ”
To me, plain John Leach from a Gov-
ernment department in the city, the argu-
ment was unanswerable ; so, looking
round for a pretext to change the sub-
ject, I noticed the bar open out as we
rounded a bend in the river.
“Looks fine and smooth to-day,” I ven-
tured.
“Yes!” retorted the skipper. “Looks!
Bars is like some women. Looks beauti-
ful and then, sudden-like, they put one
over you! ”
Approaching the outer end of the
training wall the boat, in spite of her
sixty feet of length and generous beam,
began to bob up and down in a most re-
prehensible manner. I clutched the
mizzen—or is it jigger-rigging?—and tried
to appear unconcerned; but a clammy
feeling was creeping over me. I in-
wardly decided that, in spite of the appa-
rently spotless condition of the deck, the
boat had a filthy odor of decayed fish.
In a few minutes we were out in the
bar. I was standing on the starboard
side, gazing at the bold headland about
a mile or so east of us. It seemed to be
behaving in a most extraordinary manner,
now showing high above the sea and
then disappearing altogether ; and once,
rising from one of these immersions, it
seemed literally to. stand on end. Cold
beads of perspiration formed on my
forehead, and almost at once I became
convinced that the tea I had imbibed that
morning before leaving the pub had been
made in a pot that had remainder leaves
in it from a previous brewing.
I felt indignant, for I had warned the
girl who brought the morning tea about
my physical inability to assimilate with
comfort tea of that description. (She was
such a pretty girl, too, with most de-
lectable legs.) The headland had steadied
down a bit and I was feeling a trifle less
uncomfortable, when the skipper’s voice
broke the horrible monotony of the tut-
tut-tut of the three-cylinder Diesel engine.
“What blasted bait to hand a man!
Nothing but flat-tails, Bill. Not a decent
bullhead among ’em ; and I suppose he’ll
want his eight bob a single just the same!
Youfll have to cut up some of them
kingies we caught yesterday; and don’t
dump your skeletons. We may want to
burley a bit if the current’s gone.”

I was still grasping the rigging firmly
with both hands, but, as I said before,
feeling a little better ; and, wishing to
show an intelligent interest in the bait
business, I was about to remark on the
difficulty I had had last year in obtain-
ing decent mullet bait at H when,
glancing at the deck, I saw it was red with
blood. Standing in this were three little
mounds.
One mound was of fillets rather neatly
piled; one, of the aforementioned skele-
tons, consisting of sorrowful-looking
heads connected to their tails by back-
bones thinly veiled in flesh. The third—
I held my mouth tightly shut; the remark
about last year’s bait-hunting experience
died in its inception—the third was (how
shall I describe it?) the Works!
With an involuntary groan I let go the
rigging and staggered forward a few steps,
to get away, anywhere, from the disgust-
ing spectacle. Encountering a lobster-pot
hitherto unnoticed or unregarded, I
promptly collapsed on top of it. Not
really ill, you know ; just upset.
Presently I was lifted to my feet and
escorted, not without several deviations,
to a cosy corner where the engine-house
joins the forecastlehead. Bill had
appeared.
“Lie down flat on your back!” said
Bill kindly. “You’ll be right in no time.”
Following Bill’s instructions, I fell
into a deep sleep, only to be rudely
awakened, after a particularly brief in-
terval, by a tremendous thump, thump,
thumping on the decks. I heard a raucous
voice literally screaming “Bite, you
baskets!” He didn’t say baskets, but
that’s near enough.
I stood up just in time to see Bill heave
something from over the stern, up and
over his head, and bring it down with a
thump on deck. Next he stooped down,
grabbed the fish by the throat —gills, I
mean —and held it against his chest whilst
he extracted the hook. In a second the fish
was thrown back on deck and the hook
and line overboard.
I noticed the tiller was lashed over a
bit to one side, and the boat was career-
ing round in circles. There were no fewer
than five lines towing over the stern ;
and every minute or so a beautiful big
fish, with a silver belly and yellow tail,
would soar through the air and come
down plump on the deck.
I longed to join in the sport, but felt
in my present comparatively convalescent
condition I’d better not.
In about half an hour the kingfish had
deserted us.
“We’ll let ’em go for to-day,” said the
skipper as he steadied his helm after a
few abortive circles had been traced.
“Just stand by to put that pot over
and then we’ll go after the snapper.”
As Bill silently prepared the gear for
the launching of the pot, I eyed it with
some disfavor ; and observed it had four
beastly lumps of leatherjacket skewered
into a wickerwork throat which sub-
tended from the top of the pot. Also
hanging round inside the pot were lumps
of fish encased in wire-netting. I elicited
from Bill that the bait had to be hung
up to prevent sea-slugs from eating it.
“Ready, Bill,” bawled the skipper. “Let
’er go!”
Bill picked up the heavy pot, measur-
ing four or five feet in diameter and
ballasted with three lumps of stone tied
on to the bottom, and deftly threw it
overboard. Next followed about twenty
yards of line ; then a glass ball; then
more line ; finally, three glass balls tied
on at intervals of a few feet close to the
end of the line.
I watched the three glass balls bobbing
up and down as we sailed away. “What
happened to the first ball you threw
over?” I asked Bill. “Is it broken?”
Bill grinned. “No, it’s ten fathoms
under the surface” ; and, observing my
incredulity, went on: “We’ve got to have
a float to keep the slack line from fouling
the rocks or coral on the bottom.”
“Why the bait rolled in wire-netting?”
“Oh, that’s to keep the crays from
eating it up too quick. When the food’s
done the beggars up and leave the pot.”
“Snapper lines ready!” called out the
skipper, standing, as usual, with the tiller
between his legs and glancing from time
to time over his shoulder to get his
marks “on” before stopping. “Fix his
line up for him, Bill!”
I took my 200 yards of No. 15 gut
line, neatly rolled on a flat cork by a
fisherman at the pub the day before,
which had been soaking in a bucket over-
night—the line I mean, not the fisher-
man, who had done his soaking during
the day—and handed it over to Bill,
together with some hooks.
“H’m,” said Bill, “what’s this? No. 15!
Too damned expensive for us ; we use
No. 12. And 8/0 hooks ; we use 4/o’s ;
except when we’js fishing in the deep
grounds ; then we use 6/o’s.”
“Do whatever you like, Bill,” I said
resignedly.
“Only got one line?” queried Bill. “Two
nooks, then. Fishermen working for a
living use two lines —one hook, one line.”
Suddenly the engine lever was thrown
from ahead to astern; there was a
moment’s grinding of gears and the boat
stopped dead, as did the engine. Splash,
splash, over went the lines of the skipper
and Bill, rusty old iron bolts tied on with
twine for sinkers. I hurriedly stuck on a
couple of lumps of bait from the little
heap Bill had placed on deck at my
“possie,” as he called it, and dropped my
sinkers overside. I don’t know why that
second hook should have caught in my
coat sleeve. Anyhow, before I finally
cut it out clear, there were several
snapper bobbing about on deck.
Letting my line run out, as the boat
drifted south with the current, I was ad-
miring the beautiful shades of blue and
pink and gold in these aristocrats of the
deep. “Ain’t ye going to fish?” asked
Bill. I hurriedly grasped my line, drew in
the slack and proceeded to fish. Some-
thing was nibbling, so I jerked the line
feebly. The nibbling stopped, then after
a moment began anew.
“Any bites?” called the skipper, un-
hooking a fish, baiting his hook and
throwing back the line into the water,
almost with one motion.
“Some little thing nibbling,” I replied.
He grinned and proceeded to haul in
his other line in a businesslike manner.
Feeling a touch, I jerked the line
savagely and, to my great joy, I felt the
weight on the line. I had actually hooked
one! Cautiously I tried to haul in ; but
the brute started to swing away.
“Can’t hold him!” I cried.
“Take it, Bill!” said the skipper. “I’ll
tend yours.”
Bill took the line, which was steadily
surging through my fingers, and after
about twenty minutes’ play a large black
rock-cod appeared on the surface, to be
gaffed and dragged on board.
“Weighs half a hundred,” said Bill, with
quiet satisfaction. “Something to lift
with a 4/0 hook.”
“Is he any good, Bill?” I queried.
“Worth a quid, more or less, in the
market. Don’t take many of them to
make a good day’s work!”
The skipper was beaming. “Down
again, mister! Get another one! You
can’t beat mug’s luck, fishing or racing.
Dunno about making love.”
The sun was fairly high and the long,
heavy easterly swell was not unpleasant.
I was catching a few and really just be-
ginning to enjoy myself when “Up
lines!” came from the skipper, rapidly
hauling in his own. “Up lines! ” repeated
Bill to me. I looked my protest, but he
only shook his head. I leisurely began
to haul in my line, and before it was
aboard it was streaming out astern, for
we were going full speed for the bar.
“Can you steer, mister?” As the
skipper asked the question, he was stand-
ing, as before, with the tiller between his
legs, rolling up a line on a cork. I had
just hauled the last of my line in on deck.
I nodded, looking ruefully at the mess
at my feet. “All right, come and take
her! Me and Bill’ll clear up the lines.”
As I took the tiller, the skipper pointed
to a high peak not far inland. “Keep
her for that,” he said, and left me to it.
The lines were rolled up and the two
men, on their knees on deck, got to work
cleaning the catch, the skipper, with a
long-bladed knife, deftly cutting them
open and shoving them along to Bill, who
stuck his middle finger through the gills
and dragged the—er—contents out. When
the fish were all gutted baskets of water
were thrown over them, and they were
stirred to and fro with a broom until
all signs of blood were washed off them.
After cleaning, a rough awning was
spread over them to keep the sun off.
This, I noticed, was not allowed to touch
the fish.
We were now nearing the land and
the skipper took the tiller. “Not a bit
too soon,” he remarked. “This swell will
crack like hell on the ebb-tide on the
bar! ”
Round the headland into the shallow
bay. Sure enough white tops were show-
ing on the bar.
As we got close to it, engine was
slowed, thrown out of gear: a touch
astern, as a big race came up behind us.
One, two, three, all breaking, and a fourth
bigger than all the rest. A glance to
seaward, then full ahead; and in a
moment we were gliding swiftly through
broken water.
We were just far enough inside
when another big race came roaring in
behind us, crashing heavily on the outer
edge of the bar. The wash was boiling
up to our stern ; a few drops came on
board; we seemed to be racing in
about twenty miles an hour. A moment
later we were running smoothly past the
friendly training wall.
We tied up at the little wharf at
Millhaven.
“Had a good day?” asked the skipper,
as I shook hands before stepping ashore
“Very good indeed; I’ve seen some-
thing,” I replied.
He grinned. “Come again; maybe
you’ll learn something, tool,”

and here are the reasons why:
BECAUSE
ENO’S “Fruit Salt” has triumphed over
every test of time and usage—for over
sixty years it has been the acknowledged
alkaline corrective throughout the world.
BECAUSE
ENO, in its fine powder and highly con-
centrated form, is more economical in
use and better value than the so-called
substitutes.
BECAUSE
ENO is prepared only from the finest
ingredients. It contains nothing injuri-.
ous no purgative mineral salts, no
sugar to cheapen production or prove
harmful in cases such as diabetes, no
artificial flavouring matter.
BECAUSE
ENO, wherever bought, is always the
same perfect product, unvarying in
quality,- composition and purity, and
untouched by hand in manufacture.
BECAUSE
ENO taken regularly is the natural way
to insure internal cleanliness—to elim-
inate waste matter which causes acid
poisoning and intestinal toxicity. It is
recognised as the safest, non-habit-
forming, aid to good health.
Comparison proves there is no substi-
tute. Buy a bottle of ENO’S “Fruit
Salt” to-day and prove its superiority
for yourself.
The words Eno and "Fruit Salt ” are registered trade marks.
