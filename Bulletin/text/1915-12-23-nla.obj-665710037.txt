THE FISHERMEN. '
The spot is flaked with mist, that fills,
Thickening into rolls more dank,
The thresholds and the window-sills,
And smokes on every bank.
The river stagnates, pestilent
With carrion by the current sent
This way and that —and yonder lias
The moon, just like a woman dead,
That they have smothered overhead.
Deep in the skies.
In a few boats alone there, gleam
Lamps that light, up and magnify
The backs, bent over stubbornly.
Of the old fishers of the stream.
Who since last evening, steadily—
For God knows what night-fishery—
Have let their black nets downward slow
Into the silent water go,
The noisome water there below.
Down in the river’s deeps, ill-fate
And black mischances breea and hatch,
Unseen of them, and lie in wait
As for their prey. And these they catch
With weary toil—believing still
That simple, honest work is best—
At night, beneath the shifting mist
Unkind and chill.. ...
The fishers hail each other not—
Nor help—in their fraternal lot;
Doing but that which must be done,
Each fishes for himself alone.
And this cne gathers in his net,
Drawing it tighter yet,
His freight of petty misery;
And that one drags up recklessly
Diseases from the slimy bed:
While others still their meshes spread
Out to the sorrows that drift by -
Threateningly nigh:
And the last hauls aboard with force
The wreckage dark of his remorse....
In their dark boats, where nothing stirs,
Not even the red-flamed torch that blurs
With haloes huge, as if of blood, ■
The thick -felt of the mist’s white hood,
Death with his silence seals the sere
Old fishermen of madness here.
The isolated, they abide
Deep in the mist—-still side by side.
But seeing one another never; ‘
Weary are both their arms—and yet
Their work their ruin doth beget.
Each for himself works desperately,
He knows not why—no dreams has he:
Long have' they worked, for long, long years,
While every instant brings its fears:
Nor have they over
Quitted the borders of their river, ‘
Where ’mid the moonlit mists they strain
To fish misfortune up amain.
If hut in this their night they hailed each other
And brothers’ voices might console a brother!
But numb and sullen, on they go,
With heavy brows- and backs bent low,
While their small lights beside them gleam,
Flickering feebly on the stream.
Like blocks of shadow they are there.
Nor ever do their eyes divine
That far away beyond the mists
Aend and spongy—there exists
A firmament where ’mid the night,
Attractive as a loadstone, bright
Prodigious planets shine.
The fishers black of that black plague.
They are the lost immeasurably,
Among the knells, the distance vague,
The wonder of those endless plains
That stretch more far than eye can see:
And the damp autumn midnight rains
Into their souls’ monotony.
From “Poems of Emile Verhaeren,” trans-
lated by Alma Strettell (Lane, per Sydney
Book Club).
&
Stefan Zweig’s ponderous appreciation of
Emile Verhaeren (Constable; 65.) was first
published, in German and in French, five
years ago. The present translation, by
Jethro Bithell, was issued just on the out-
break of the war. Read in the exposure of
Hun culture that the war has brought about
it is almost amusing. “The evolution of the
phenomena of culture seems to proceed with
ever greater rapidity: never was the span
of a hundred years as rich, as replete as that
which stretches to the threshold of our own
days.... Land's that once yawned far apart
are now forged together by the iron h00p....
and now in the very air man is building a
new road from country to country.” He
speaks of Belgium as in its adolescence, re-
joicing in its new, unsought strength. “This
new Belgian race is a strong race, one of
the most capable in Europe.... pulsing with
vitality. Nowhere in Europe is life so in-
tensely, so merrily enjoyed -as in Flanders.
....To-day Belgium is relatively the richest
country in- Europe.” Belgium, over-run by
the hordes of Stefan Zweigs! And he pic-
tures for us the idyllic life that Verhaeren
lives in the Walloon district. “Here he leads
the peaceful existence which is necessary for
the growth of great work; here he holds soli-
tary communion with Nature, undistracted
by the voices of men and the hubbub of .great
towns; here he dreams tiis cosmic visions.”
Verhaeren, who has written that scathing
indictment of Hun culture, Belgium's
Agony! This “Socialist poet, the poet of
the age of machinery, of democracy, and of
the European race,” is a fugitive from his
stricken land. He who “saw Europe already
united by one great common energy,” and a
new community, a united race, the European,
in process of formation!
The book is erudite, clumsy, massive,
swamping beneath tiie flood of Hun peda-
gogism the genius of the man. Yet here and
there Zweig strikes out a useful definition.
He calls Verhaeren’s poems symphonic poems,
because their range is so vast that they
seem to have been composed for an orchestra.
“They are not, like the poetry of a past
generation, chamber music; they are not
solitary Violin soli; they are an inspired
blending of all instruments.” But when
Zweig suggests, that Verhaeren’s poems are
poems in the form of a parabola, his dull
pedagogism overtaxes his strength. “While
the lyric mostly represents a symmetrical
and harmonious form, a return to itself, a
circle, Verhaeren’s poem has the form of a
parabola, apparently irregular but really
equally governed by a law.” Yet his state-
ment is apt that “the great part of the
new blood for his language (his startling
use of new words in poetry) came not so
much from Flemish as from science.” And
he, naturally, claims that the further Ver-
naeren developed the more Teutonic became
his voice. Of course, being the greatest
poet of Europe, he must be roped in. “Ver-
haeren is to-day part and parcel of Teutonic
U u e ‘” ® ut definition may stand:
verhaeren has discovered new moral and
religious values in science, just as he had
already discovered new aesthetic values in
Industrialism and democracy.”
. J* '
Alma Strettell’s selection of translations
ot the Poems of Emile Verhaeren (Lane,
per Sydney Book Club) is admirably done
but scarcely representative. The translator
admits that her field of selection has been
limited to the three volumes of what may
be called Verhaeren’s middle period, with
the exception of three of his later poems.
Her translation of such impressionistic pic-
tures as “Rain,” “The Wind,” “The
Silence” and “Snow” actually reproduces
the spirit of Verhaeren. In these poems the
elements are not described: they are felt.
The rain actually descends, the wind blows,
the silence is upon us, the snow falls.
Long as unending threads, the long-drawn rain
Interminably, with its nails ot grey,
Athwart the dull grey day,
Rakes the green window-pane—
So infinitely, endlessly, the rain,
The long, long rain.
The rain.
And in “The Grave Digger” :
By all the surroimding roads, each day
They come toward him, the coffins white,
They come in processions infinite;
They' come from the distances far away,
Prom corners obscure and out-of-the-way,
Prom the heart of the towns—and the wide-spreading
plain,
The limitless' plain, swallows up their track ;
They come with their escort of people in black,
At every hour, till the day doth wane;
And at early dawn, the long trains forlorn
Begin again....
The grave-digger watches them come into sight,
The long, slow roads,
Marching toward him, with all their loads
Of coffins white.
So in “The Wind” there is this impressive
picture:—- ■'
Ar.d there on its hill
Of dingy and dun-colored turf, the black mill,
Swift up from below, through the empty air slash-
ing,
Swift down from above, like a lightning-stroke flash-
. ing,
Tlie black mill so sinister moweth the wind,
The savage, fierce wind of November!
And in “The Glory of the Heavens” the
poet lifts us to the stars:—
See, from Nadir to Zenith one aureole doth reach!
Of yore, the souls exalted by faith’s high mysteries
Saw, in the dominion of those star-clouded skies,
Jehovah’s hand resplendent and heard His silent
. speech.
But now the eyes that scan them no longer may there
aspire
To see some god self-banished—not so, hut the in-
tricate
Tangle of marvellous problems, the messengers that
wait ,
On Measureless Force, and veil her, there on her
couch ol fire....
Tumults consumed in whirlpools of speed and sound
and light—
Violence -we nought may reek of! —and yet there
falls from thence
The vast, unbroken silence, mysterious and intense,
That makes the peace, the calmness and beauty of
the night!,...
Shining in dim transparence, the whole of infinity
lies
Behind the veils that the finger of radiant winter
weaves;
And down on us falls the foliage of stars in glitter-
ing sheaves,
Prom out the depths of the forest, the forest obscure
of the skies.
Germany in Defeat
Count Charles de Souza and Major Hal-
dane Macfall, the joint-authors of Germany
in Defeat (Paul, Trench and Triibner, per
Dymock’s Library), have done a difficult
thing: they have made an absorbing story
out of “a strategic history of the war.” And
this, in the face of the authors’ dubious
claims to a knowledge of events and to a
strategic genius worthy of a Joffre. “With-
out the advantage of communion with the
leaders and commanders, we have, from
strategic training, sought out the motive of
strategic acts, and drawn deductions from
the attempts to execute those acts.... The
secrecy imposed by the commanders, especi-
ally the French, has not made for ease
but by dogged watchfulness and by his quick
grasp of strategy Count Charles de Souza
has rarely been baffled for long in regard to
the position of any unit.” This claim of
infallibility puts the reader on his guard.
How is it possible for the authors to divine
the secrets of the German General Staff?
But the reader will be convinced in the end
or the extremely high probability of the truth
of the authors’ guesses. The fact is obvious
that every possible effort has been made to
plot out the actual positions of the various
armies not only every day, but often
with a significant mention of the particular
hour of the day—or night.
And the remarkable conclusion that the
authors reach is quite credible. It is no
less than that: “Germany was defeated at
the Marne —she has been a defeated people
ever since—and at hand is, and must reso-
lutely be carried out, her complete crushing
as a fighting force.” Already the destinies
of Europe for generations have been shaped,
though few of us have realised this fact.
The vast operations now pending are but
the perfecting of an achievement. Germany
is defeated—but that is not to say that she
is yet vanquished. But since the Marne she
has been fighting a losing fight “France
nol only bore the onrush of Germany’s
legions with consummate strategic ability,
but she came within an ace of crushing the
German armies very early in the campaign
on Belgian soil; and within a few weeks
had not only stalled off the German attack,
but had defeated the German arms in a
series of battles that decided the destinies
of European civilisation.... Hours before
they arrived within sight of Paris the Ger-
man General Staff must have sat uneasy in
their saddles —for these men are soldiers,
and they are bound to have realised that
the- master-mind and master-will of the
whirlwind was no German, but lay in one
called Joffre, and that Prussia had brought
forth no man of genius to compare with
him. They must have realised that, except
by some wild stroke of fortune, they were a
defeated people—and it is to their credit
that they so realised their defeat, and with
consummate skill prepared a series of posi-
tions for their retirement so that that defeat
should at least not become a mad rout.”
The authors prove, by means of highly
elucidative maps of the varying dispositions
of the opposing forces, that Joffre based his
strategy upon his main defensive line —the
true pivot of the whole scheme—the fort-
resses on his eastern frontier. Never did
he lose sight of that frontier, sure that it
was through that line that the Hun meant
to hack his way. And Joffre was , right!
That is the remarkable fact that the authors
prove—as far as anything can be proved
without the actual orders issued by the Ger-
man staff. And the inescapable corollary
to this assumption is that the Huns did not
mean to make for Paris by the Belgian
route. When the Belgians resisted at Lihge
and England declared War, the Huns
assumed that the French would immediately
rush'to the rescue of Belgium, thus weaken-
ing their eastern forces. The Hun plan was
to get the French up 'into Belgium, over-
whelm those hasty, armies there, and,. then
pierce, their weakened eastern line, in front
of which —-it is a highly significant fact—the
army of the' Crown Prince was waiting. To
the Crown Prince was given the role of
marching on Paris through Reims. That
was the German scheme. The authors mar-
shal a number of facts in support of their
theory, and ask why the Huns waited two
weeks after the attack on Ligge before they
attacked Namur? Why did not the Huns
press on to Brussels, which they could have
reached'in three days? Because it did not
suit their strategy. The early news that
came from Belgium told us of the Hun
armies being hurled back by the extraor-
dinarily inferior forces of the heroic Bel-
gians. These were but reconnaisances in
force: the Huns were “feeling” for the main
Belgian and French armies, and probably
the British force, which, according to their
theories, should by that time have entered
Belgium. But Joffre refused to walk info
the trap.
His counter-offensive in Alsace failed
tactically, but was of the highest strategic
value. It enabled Joffre to complete the
concentration of his armies, and it worried
the Hun headquarters, by compelling them
to detach large forces against this unex-
pected menace, and by misleading them as to
the disposal of the French armies.
The Crown Prince failed to break through
at Verdun, and thus his intention of cutting
the communications of the northern armies
remained unfulfilled. All that was left for
the Huns now to do was to attempt an
enveloping of the French and British retire-
ment from Belgium, and that was arranged
to take place a long way from Paris. “So
certain were the German leaders that vic-
tory lay at last within their grasp in north-
ern France that it did not occur to them to
seize, and occupy the French seaports of
Qalais, Boulogne and Havre. They left
these places behind them as so much use-
less, cumbersome impedimenta.” They ex-
pected Joffre to accept action in the north
and to let himself be surrounded there.
Joffre had of course been careful to give the
Huns that illusion. And he retired to the
line on which he had decided to force his
general action. The Germans were not
marching on Paris. They were not such
fools. “Ever since the first efforts of the
Crown Prince had been foiled in Lorraine
and the Ardennes, the idea of a direct march
on Paris had been abandoned by the German
leaders, for it stood to reason that the
French armies in the field must be dealt
with first A single glance at the map
would have shown that only one extremity
of the huge. German line could have come in
direct and immediate contact with Paris.”
&
The world’s attention has hitherto been
focussed upon Paris, leaving the much more
important battles on the eastern line almost
unnoticed. It is the aim of this book to
enforce the tremendous importance of those
battles. The presence of the Kaiser at
Nancy—not near Paris —indicates the stra-
tegic centre of the operations. And there he
had the pleasure of seeing his soldiers
defeated under his very eyes.
When Joffre decided to advance, his aim
was not merely to hold up the German
advance, but to involve the German armies
in a complete disaster. He aimed at the
envelopment and destruction of Kluck’s
army. That he did not succeed was due
to the army under Lamaze acting prema-
turely. Kluck, coming into contact with
that army just as he was walking into the
trap, wheeled round and escaped. This was
the second time that Joffre lost an important
advantage by the incompetency of one of
his generals.
An important point is brought out with
reference to Kluck’s retreat. Who “saved”
Paris? Not the army under Maunoury, nor
the British who reinforced him just in time.
What caused Kluck and Bulow to abandon
their positions so suddenly and retreat to
the Aisne? For that abandonment was
made at a very curious hour. It occurred
in the early morning—not, as is usual —
under cover of night. “What at the eleventh
hour caused Kluck and Bulow, who were
holding their own fairly well, to retire —to
fly—so precipitately? The German failure
to pierce the French lines —an event that,
in the opinion of the French staff, would
have utterly shattered the French offensive,
was solely due to General Foch’s victory at
FSre Champenoise. He it was who saved
Paris, and also saved,, Joffre’s left wing
from ultimate disaster. “The indications
that this action was the most important and
decisive of all those fought in western
France are not lacking.” Chief of these was
the proclamation by German Headquarters:
“Everything depends on the result of to-
morrow,” which was issued in the locality
and on the date of that battle. The Ger-
mans, it must be remembered, had the means
of entrenching on the Marne as they did
later on the Aisne; and but for Foch’s
victory Paris would have been bombarded,
and the French northern ports occupied by
the Germans. And second only in import-
ance to this stupendous victory was Sarrail’s
defence of Verdun, the eastern pivot of the
western armies of France. The capture of
Verdun by the Huns would have appreci-
ably altered the whole course of the war.
The army assigned for its capture was com-
manded by the Growii Prince, and was the
largest army on the German line.
; &
“The victory of. the Marne, in a general
sense, was complete. The Germans had not
been annihilated, nor definitely overthrown,
as Joffre had meant that they should be.
But the shadow of defeat and of permanent
invasion that had hung over France until
then was dispelled, and dispelled for ever.
The theory of German invincibility which
had been flouted across the world for half a
century was shattered. It was proved' in
this titanic action, which settled the future
destinies of Europe, that the Germans, with
the superiority of numbers (which they
enjoyed all along the line), and a
most perfect military organisation, were
unable to crush their adversaries, as they
were expected to do by the vast majority of
onlookers. On the contrary, they were
thrown back and pursued for a distance of
40 miles by opponents who were much
weaker in numbers, and who further lacked
the military organisation and thorough
preparation of the Germans.
“To what was this surprising result due?
... .To superb strategy, for everything else
being equal, or ever somewhat unequal, as
was the case in this campaign, strategy
must and will always prevail The Ger-
mans must have won the campaign, and the
war, if they had had a Joffre or a Foch at
their head. For it must never be forgotten
that the greatest surprise of this war was
not the heroic conduct of the Belgians, nor
the tactical efficiency of the ‘contemptible’
little army of Britain, but the totally un-
known and unadvertised ability of the
French staff.”
And now there remains but one other
task —the difficulties of which need no
emphasis —that of battering and finally
crushing Germany already “in defeat.”

The shadow of the war, for the first time,
is cast over the kiddies’ Christmas books.
Blaekie’s publications this year furnish, as
usual, the finest entertainment for the child-
mind. They are intelligently written and
artistically illustrated. BlaeJcie's Children's
Annual has this year, everywhere except on
its cover, a military character that will in-
terest and delight the children of this new
epoch. The fairy story still remains, and
there is an abundance of child-humor; but
the prevailing hue of the illustrations is
khaki._ This color is still more prominent in
BlacMe’s Story-Time Booh. However, in
addition to these lordly volumes, this firm
has plenty of delightful new kiddies’ books
to choose from. One especially well illus-
trated and printed is Old Friends and New
Fahles•. The contents-lists of these publica-
tions include such writers as lan Hay and
Mrs. George Wemyss, and such artists as
H. M. Brock and Ren6 Bull.
That brilliant pupil of Julian Ashton,
Ruby Winckler, has found a congenial
medium for her original fancy and dainty
penwork in the, illustration and decoration
of a children’s book, Who's Who in the Land
of Nod, by Sarah S. Vanderbilt (Houghton,
Mifflin, Boston). Miss Winckler’s work
steadily improves.

Cartridges
For Rifles, Revolvers or Pistols
The most accurate shooting rifle, revolver
or pistol made will do unsatisfactory work
unless the cartridges used in it are as accurate
as the arm. For that reason it is important
when buying to get cartridges that have an
established reputation for quality. Win-
chester —the yif brand of cartridges in all
calibers from .22 to .50 are unexcelled for
accuracy, penetration and uniform shooting
qualities. They cost no more than inferior
makes and are for sale everywhere. If you
want to get the most satisfactory results with
your rifle, revolver or pistol, always use
Winchester ammunition. Do not simply
ask for “some cartridges” when you buy,
but be sure to specify Winchester make
and look for the bold w on the box.

“A Few Words of Thanks
for the good your Wonderful
Medicine has done for me.
My Mother has Great
Faith in your fine Tonic.”
The above are extracts from the letter from Miss
Mary O’Brien, a Richmond Lady, and which is
published below. Women should specially read it.
WILLIAM STREET, RICHMOND,
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.— N.S.AV., 8/10/’l5.
“A few words of thanks to you for the good your wonderful
medicine has done for me. I think that I have been one of the
greatest dyspeptics on record, suffering with weakness, lassitude, had
headaches, and my nerves were in a very had state.
“I tried many remedies, hut they did not do me any good. My
mother has great faith in your wonderful Tonic, and has used it on
and off for years, with excellent results.
“She advised me to give Clements Tonic a trial, and it was a
happy day for me that I bought three bottles. It increased my appe-
tite, and strengthened my nerves and body. Every dose seems to
make me feel stronger, and I can now eat and sleep well. I sincerely
trust that other sufferers will benefit by its timely aid.
“You may use this as you deem fit, as it is all the truth.”

Try it and yon will sleep as sweetly as a little child.

A Great REMEDY for
BLADDER TROUBLE.
Drinking water that is of bad quality or
too soft often causes bladder trouble. Every
sufferer tortured with the agonising burning
pains of bladder inflammation (cystitis)
should try a harmless remedy which gives
relief in ninety-nine cases out of every hun-
dred in a way that can only be described as
miraculous.
This torture and pain is caused through
germs in the bladder, De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills contain a very strong,
yet marvellously soothing antiseptic, which

penetrates the diseased tissues, attacks and
destroys the germs, makes the urine after a
time bright and clean, bringing a wonderful,
quick l sense of relief and ease.
If you are troubled with rheumatism,
gout, gravel, backache, tired feeling, dropsy,
Bright's disease, constipation, cloudy urine,
inflammation of the bladder, or other
symptoms of urinary trouble you should
give this wonderful remedy a trial imme-
diately, because it brings quick relief, almost
every time—guaranteed—and a sure cure
follows in most cases.
To; cure rheumatism or any other form
of kidney trouble you must positively get
rid of tiie cause—the poisonous uric acid.
IP:member to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change
to a muddy bluish color —-a feature which
distinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —-you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing touch
on the right .spot.—the kidneys and the
bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to the
kidneys-—that is why De Witt’s Pills give
such amazingly quick relief —every time.
A permanent cure follows in almost every
case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.

Spring Song of a Benedict.
This world is well supplied with Girl,
Of ev’ry shape and size;
The red that is her lips invites,
The promise of untold delights
Is harbored in her eyes.
But not for me her luring curls,
Her figure’s lissome glee;
And sour indeed tastes Hymen's pill
When I reflect she never will
Again be kissed by me!
Although the gay Spring Girl is here,
My hunting days are done.
I muse, on passion’s billows tossed :
“ ’Tis better to have loved and lost,
Than to have loved and won!”

DUN BROWN.
The Boys’ Bonfire.
They have stacked the bonfire high;
The red flames cover it,
Light their faces, light the sky,
And dim the stars over it.
Oh, the hroacl flame and the noise,
The shouting and replying!
Oh, sonny, the crowding boys,
The red sparks flying!
Throw the last branch on the blaze
That leaps, and flickers out again.
The boys are gone by different ways;
Down the roads they shout again.
Draw' close to the sinking light;
The cold wind is’ crying.
Oh, sonny, the circling night,
The poor flames dying!
VICTORIA.
PATRICIA MURCHISON.
The Sea-road.
The terrace fades to ones and twos, the gate
becomes a fence;
The open’s tugging at my shoes, to draw
and draw me hence;
’Tis little that your love can do to hold the
heart o’ me;
For the long road, the brown road goes
winding to the sea.
Oh, every dusty city train becomes a market-
cart.
And little showers of summer rain are
washing all my heart;
’Tis little that the town can do to hold me
to its breast
While the hill is calling, calling, with the
flowers on its crest.
The cart becomes a waggon and the fence
becomes a hedge,
And the world is like a flagon with the sea
upon its edge ;
’Tis little that your tears can do to bind me
to the land
While an ocean wind is waiting with its
chin upon its hand.
And outward from the noisy street and
onward I must fare,
To feel the sand about my feet and drink
the joyous air;
’Tis little that your kiss can do, ’tis nothing
you can find
To rule a single rebel thought that’s master
of my mind.
Oh I can feel a tender month a-kissing at
my throat,
And faery fingers from the south are pluck-
ing at my coat;
And I have found a melody all ready to my
lips
Which tells of merry waters and the march-
ing of the ships.
’Tis little that your arm can do to hold me
to your side,
I go to where the sky is blue and where the
sea is wide ;
For clear along the open road upon the
breeze there comes
The beating of the breakers like the roll of
kettledrums.
And past the houses and the farms a young
and virgin breeze
Is lying there to fling her arms about my
naked knees,
To hold me till my ear is gla'd with all the
magic, tunes
Which come up with the dawn-light and
loiter ’mid the dunes.
Oh never city day can run, oh never morn
but brings
Fair visions of a place of sun all flecked
with wheeling wings,
And high above the traffic’s din there clearly
comes across
The plain tings of the sea-mew and the
splendid albatross.
Oh never shall the city toll retain my heart
in fee,
For all the current of my soul is setting
toAvard the sea;
And all the wishes of my heart are flowing
as a tide
To where the sea is ’waiting me, white-
veiled as a bride.
’Tis little you have known of me, and never
have you guessed
The gipsy in the blood o’ me, and all the
strong unrest
That calls and calls me outward in the
monody of waves
To the wonder of the shore-line and the
mystery of caves.
O little girl! O tender girl! it is a grievous
wrong
To try to take the city whirl and mould it
to a song;
So I must follow out to where the sea is
- -calling now -
And leave you ’mid your tresses with my
kiss upon your brow.

FIGHTING WITH A GUN AT HALF-
COCK.
“They might as Avell have conscription right
aAvay,” Avas the apt comment of Hughes
two or three months ago, AAffien details were
published of the Maoriland recruiting
scheme. Last week Hughes himself be-
came the head and front of a similar scheme
in Australia, and the force of the observa-
tion he passed on what Maoriland Avas
doing stands unimpaired for application to
his own handiwork. “This Government Avill
have nothing to do with conscription in any
shape or form” was Fisher’s contribution
to the discussion six months ago. They
were the words of a commonplace man with
another sort of job in his pocket, who from
the day Australia became involved in the
struggle against Prussia just drifted down
the stream of events, giving no indication
that he knew whither or that lie saw beyond
the circumstances of the moment. To his
successor has been left the task of converting-
figures of speech into actualities, of sys-
tematising Australia’s participation in the
Avar, of getting doAvn to the bedrock of
things. And Hughes’s method of making
a start is to tell Australia that “the re-
sources of the Allies.... must be marshalled.
To wage this war with less than our full
strength is to commit national suicide by
slowly bleeding to death,” and to ask every
Australian of military age to state whether
he is ready to enlist, and, if not, to say why.
Hughes might as well have conscription
right away. It would be a less roundabout
and laborious proceeding if every man were
asked to show cause why he should not be
given a weapon. But the shadoAV of volun-
taryism has to be preserved, and the spur
of compulsion withheld, in theory if not in
fact.
* * * #
Hughes having made this step to get out
of Jthe bog of uncertainty—a fatal place for
a country to be in at times of war —meets
a wild shriek from certain Brisbane and Mel-
bourne Labor men, who “object to compul-
sion.” and complain that the scheme now
launched is the thin end of the wedge or
something. In Melbourne the Trades
Council has gone to the extreme of com-
municating with members of all affiliated
unions, urging them to ignore the Prime
Minister’s circular and boycott his registra-
tion cards. This has been done apparently
on the ground that “there should be no
compulsion for defence service unless there
is also conscription of wealth.” Tiie
Bulletin hopes and believes that Victorian
unionists who receive the communication
issued by the Trades Council will treat it
with contempt—that they are better citizens
and have a more just appreciation of the
perils confronting their country and their
mates in European trenches than the wild-
cat council which in this matter is trying to
defeat the State in the performance of a
legitimate function. The answer to the blither
of these garrulous enemies of both civilisa-
tion and democracy is easy. The information
asked for by the Federal Government is not
required for purposes of imposing compulsory
service on Australians. It is wanted in
order to determine whether even the ghost
of the voluntary principle can be maintained
—to discover how many men are ready to
voluntarily respond to the call and how
many are not, instead of muddling along
trying to find out with great incorrectness
by haranguing the multitude at street cor-
ners, writing letters to the newspapers and
getting little contingents armed with banners
to undertake long, wasteful tramps through
the dust and mud of country roads. The
results of the poll or census of men of mili-
tary age may show that 90 per cent, are
ready to get measured for a uniform. What
objection can there be at a Trades Hall
against having this known, and the State
being in possession of the 90 per cent.’s name
and address? It may conceivably be discov-
ered that nine men out of 10 have deter-
mined not to enlist. If that is the case it
should be known in order that public policy
and individual effort and the politician who
draws expenses for urging his brothers to go
and fight may not grope blindly on in the
dark. In either case the Melbourne obstruc-
tionists should rejoice, for in the event of the
first contingency they would see a trium-
phant vindication of voluntaryism. If it
were shown to them that volunteering could
not be relied upon, they should also be glad,
if they are honest men, since opportunity
would thus be afforded them of- ceasing to
lean on a broken reed.
*■■**'#■
To object to military service on the
ground that “conscription of wealth should
come first” is not honest. Such an objection
involves a confession that both are desirable,
one good thing being refused merely because
two are not offered. The argument is not
against conscription but in favor of more of
it than anyone has yet been able to propose
in terms that could be understood. What is
the meaning of conscription of wealth?
What are the steps Australia would have to
take in order to immediately accomplish it
holus bolus? For purposes of carrying on
the war, or carrying on business - as a fish-
monger, or doing anything else, the State
has sovereign power to call upon the wealth
of the country. It could to-morrow, at a single
sitting of (he Legislature, dredge every cent
out of the community’s pocket. Australia has
had conscription of wealth for many a day,
and has called up whatever it has thought
proper. For year's and years this country
has been wrestling Avith the problem of social-
ising ’ the State’s material resources. How
much has been socialised? Very little! In
any case, the undertaking is one of vast
difficulty, and no nation can afford to spend
its time wrangling over how the job is going
to be done when it stands confronted with
the question of how to protect its bare
existence.
This war is no picnic. It calls for every
ounce of effort the countries participating
in the struggle are capable of making. And
it is no sort of use refusing to recognise the
possibilities of defeat or being deluded into
the paralysing belief that victory is certain
anyhow. When Germany struck suddenly, at
a partially unprepared Avorld the position
before her opponents was grave to the point
of being desperate. It is grave to-day—how
that other enemy, the censorship,
will not permit the public to knoAV. All
along the pressing need of our armies has
been men and munitions. The shortage of
arms is being made good: the call for men
is continuous. To throw fewer men into the
disturbance than Ave possess is equivalent to
giving the enemy an advantage. The time
is not one for splitting hairs about the mean-
ing of words, or filling the air Avith. language
about something else, or risking ruin on the
off-chance that Bill and .Tim and the other
chap will rise to the occasion after reading
the hocussed newspapers long enough and
listening to the patriotic speech with suffi-
cient frequency. At such an hour as this,
differing in no respect from that which would
have struck if an enemy was actually on
Australian soil, the first paramount need of
Australia is to knoAV all there is. to knoAV
about who can fight and where he is. With-
out this knoAvledge and without an orderly,
coherent system of serving out guns all
round, the country is pawing the atmosphere
blindfolded, just trusting to luck, hanging on
to a formula which even Asquith admits
operates Avith injustice, and for which
Hughes can find no more damning testi-
monial than that it succeeds very Avell in
alloAying us to fight with half strength. The
half Australia is not using is to all intents
and purposes on the side of the Hun.
THE SINGING SOLDIERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When I’m sittin’ in me dug-out wiv me
rifle on me knees,
An’ a yowlin’, ’owlin’ chorus comes afloatin’
up the breeze,
Jist a bit o’ ‘Bonnie Mary’ or ‘Long Way to
Tipperary,’
Then I know I’m fp Australia, took an’
planted overseas?)
They’ve bin up agen it solid since we crossed
the flamin’ foam ;
But they’re singin’. alwiz singin’, since we
left the wharf at ’ome.
“Oh, it’s ‘On the Mississippi’ or ‘Me Grey
’Ome in the West’;
If it’s death an’ ’Ell nex’ minute they must
git it orf their chest.
’Ere’s a suatcli o’ ‘When Yer Roamin -
When Yer Roamin’ in the (Roamin’ —
’Strutli! the first time that I ’card it, wiv
me ’ead on Rosie’s breast,
We wus cornin’ frum a picnic in a Ferutree
Gully train....
But the shrapnel made the music when I
’eard it sung again.”
So I gits it straight frum Ginger in ’is letter
’ome to me .
On a dirty scrap o’ paper wiv the writin’
'ard to see.
“Strike!” ses ’e, “it sounds like skitin’; but
theyTe singin’ while they’re fightin’:
An’ they socks it inter Abdul to the toon
of ‘Nancy Lee.’
An’ I seen a bloke this mornin’, wiv ’is arm
blown to a rag,
’Ummin’ ‘Break the Noos to Mother’ w’ile ’e
sucked a soothin’ fag.
“Now, the British Tommy curses, an’ the
French does fancy stunts,
An’ the Turk ’e ’owls to Aller, an’ the
Gurkha grins an’ grunts;
But our boys are singin’, singin’, while the
blinded shells are dingin’
Mud an’ death inter the trenches in them
’eavens called the Fronts.
An’ I guess their souls keep singin’ when
they gits the tip to g 0”....
So I gits it straight frum Ginger ; an’
Gorstruth! ’e ort to know.
An’ ’is letter gits me thinkin’ when I read
sich tales as these,
An’ I takes a look around me at; the pad-
dicks an’ the trees ;
When I ’ears the thrushes trillin’, when I
’ear the magpies fillin’
All the air ’tween earth an’ ’Eaven wiv their
careless melerdies,
It’s the sunshine of the country, caught an’
turned to bonder notes,
Bottled sunbeams changed to music pouring
from a thousand throats!
Can a soldier ’elp ’is singin’ when ’e’s born
in sicli a land?
Wiv the sunshine an’ the music pourin’ out
on ev’ry ’and?
Where the very air is singin’, an’ each
breeze that blows is bringin’
’Armony an’ mirth an’ music fit to beat the
blazin’ band?
On the march, an’ in the trenches, when a
swingin’ chorus starts,
They are pourin’ out the sunshine of their
’omeland from their ’earts.
Oh, I’ve ’eard it, Lord, I’ve ’eard it since
the days when I wus young,
On the beach an’ in the bar-room, in the
bush I’ve ’eard it sung:
“Belle Mahone” an’ “Annie Laurie,”
“Sweet Marie” to “Tobermory,”
Commin toons an’ commin voices, but I’ve
’eard ’em when they rung
Wiv full, ’appy ’earts be’ind ’em, careless as
a thrush’s song,
*Wiv me arm around a diner, an’ me notions
fur frum wrong.
So they growed wiv ’earts a-siugin’ since the
days of careless kids,
Beefin’ out an ’appy chorus jist when Mother
Natclier bids ;
Singin’, wif their notes a-quiver, “Down
upon the Swanee River,”
There’s sich times I’d not be sellin’ fer a
stack o’ golden quids.
An’ they’re singin’, still they’re singin’ to
the sounds of guns an’ drums,
As they sung one golden Springtime under-
neath the wavin’ gums.
When they socked it to the Southland wiv
our sunny boys aboard —-
Them that stopped a dam torpeder, an’ a
knock-out punch wus scored ;
When they floundered in the water in that
scene of sudden slaughter,
Then orl thorts o’ death an’ drownin’ wus
jist trifles they ignored.
They spat out the blasted ocean, an’ they
filled ’emselves wiv air,
An’ they passed along the chorus of “Aus-
tralier Will Be There.”
Yes, they sung it in the water ; an’ a bloke
aboard a ship
Sez ’e knoo they wus Australians be the way
they give it lip—-
Sung it to the soothin’ motion of the dam’
devourin’ ocean
Like a crowd o’ seaside trippers in to ’ave a
little dip.
When I ’eard that tale, I tell yeh straight,
I sorter felt a choke ;
Fer I seemed to ’ear ’em singin’, an’ I know
that sorter bloke.
Yes, I know ’im ; an’ I seen ’im barrackin’
Eternity,,
An’ the land that ’e wus born in is the
land that mothered me.
Strike! I ain’t no sniv’lin’ blighter, but I
own me eyes get brighter
When I see ’em pokin’ mullock at the ever-
- lastin’ sea—•
When I hear ’em mockin’ terror wiv a merry
' slab o’ mirth,
’Ell! I’m proud I been to fjjiol in sich a
land as give ’em birth!
“When I’m sittin’ in me dug-out wiv the
bullits droppin’ near,”
Writes ole Ginger, “an’ a chorus smacks me
in the flamin’ ear —
P’raps a song that Rickards billed, or
p’raps a line o’ ‘Waltz Matilder,’
Then I feel I’m in Australier, took an’
shifted over ’ere.
Till the music sorter gits me an’ I let me
top notes roam
While I treats the gentle foeman to a chunk
uv ‘ ’Oiney Sweet ’Ome.’ ”
They wus singin’ on the troopship, they wus
singin’ in the train ;
When they left their land be’ind ’em they
wus shoutin’ a refrain,
An’ I’ll bet they ’ave a chorus, gay an’ glad
in greetin’ for us,
When their bit o’ scrappin’s over, an’ they
lob back ’ome again....
An’ the blokes that ain’t returnin’ —blokes
that pays the biggest price—
They’ll go singin’, singin’, singin’ to the
Gates o’ Paradise.
VICTORIA.
THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.
A CHRISTMAS SERMON ABOUT THE
MAKING OF SOULS.
The ancient writing which says man shall
not live by bread alone reflected the thought
of a person who knew a good deal more than
the average trade unionist. The need of
bread with a bit of cheese now and then is
so great, and the struggle for it often so
keen, that things which are of equal or
greater importance have hardly a look-in in
those places where “practical politics are
discussed. While man is essentially a unity,
and while the nature of his dinner unques-
tionably colors his poetry and arts, it is
convenient still to speak of him as divided
into two sections —the body and the soul.
Body and soul may be separable or insepar-
able; but the fine, large argument on this
point, whether settled one way or the other,
can never alter the plain fact that when we
talk about a man’s soul we mean something
that is quite definite, be its residence the
stomach, the boots or the hat. The soul <>i
a man is, in short, all that part of him
which is not purely physical, the part which
in all but a very few of his relations with
his fellows counts the most. This being so,
there must be a place for the soul in any
true system of economics; for the aggregate
feeling of individual souls makes the soul
of the nation, and a nation without a soul
is simply a large, flabby beast grazing on
the landscape without purpose or hope.
Australia has a soul of a rudimentary sort,
but keenly alive and gradually evolving into
something of larger compass and wider aim ;
and this soul, being the summing up
of all that Australian people think and
feel, is well worth some attention. By
thoughts and feelings the real Australia
must live just as really as. she can ever live
by bacon, eggs or pumpkins. Yet the Trades
Hall doesn’t worry about this, side of
economies, and the politician rarely mentions
it ; for there is a general notion that souls
are made by chance, and that beyond a
primary education nothing can be done to
feed them.
Yet soul food in amazing quantities is
being shovelled upon the national plate and
forced upon the national market. Books,
magazines and papers are under every pair
of spectacles; drama and vaudeville are
always Avithin sight and sound of those who
have an evening to spare ; and the picture-
show flickers by day and night its . appeal
to one sense and 50 emotions. All this mass
.of stuff is offered for sale and swallowed by
the Australian public; and out of it the
Australian soul is being manufactured. The
diet is certainly sufficient; it is the quality
that is in question. Everywhere the import-
ing notion has become a habit. The great
bulk of our soul-raising material is Yankee
or English—the Yankee enormously prepon-
derating, if not in actual quantity at any
rate in distinctiveness of taste and season-
ing. Judged by the elements out of which
it is being constructed, the Australian soul
of the future will wear its wings with a
Yankee twang and its waistcoat with a
John Bull curve, and have nothing to show
where it belongs except the greenhide san-
dals on its feet. In short, the intellectual
life of Australia —its thought, taste, humor
and feeling, and all that makes the soul of a
people—is being forced into an alien mould
because the Commonwealth is a convenient
dumping-ground for the waste products of
intellectual industry in other countries.
A nation, to be a nation, must develop its
own gifts, sing its own songs, tell its own
tales, write its own books, act its own plays
and paint its own pictures; but in Aus-
tralia none of these things are being done on
any considerable scale or with any reason-
able chance of proper recognition. No Aus-
tralian really doubts that we have the ability
to do them; yet, except in rare instances,
the Australian who attempts any of thein
finds that he must in the end go away to
get a hearing and secure a reward. Tentli-
rqte> Australian writers have made good in
America ; good Australian writers have won
fame in London by. S eeasing in all essentials
to be Australian. The Australian book has
a chance of Australian sale if published in
another country; and the Australian play
has a chance of being produced locally if it
has first been tried-out at a distance of
10,000 miles from its source. All this is
very discouraging to the local striver in the
field of creative art, and has a tendency to
make him take to auctioneering, drink or
flight; but it seems to be quite outside the
range of knowledge of the statesmen. The
facts that vaudeville forces upon Australian
ears the obscure American joke; that
soprano and contralto on our concert plat-
forms continue to chant almost exclusively
about nightingales, larks and bright flowers
blooming in our winter months, with stray
references to our youth in Devonshire or
Virginia ; that “crook” plays suggest Yankee
forms of crime hitherto unknown in the
Commonwealth, and that a thousand copies
of Yankee and English fiction are seen in
our shops for one of Australian origin, never
seem to suggest to the men in office that the
importing business has gone far enough and
that something might reasonably be done
about it.
* * * *
The remedy in most cases is quite near at
hand, quite simple and likely to become
popular with everybody who really has a
soul worth Australianising. In the case of
plays a premium for the right to produce
work other than Australian would even
things up at once and set the local play-
wrights busy. The existing managements
would probably declare that they were
ruined because they would then be forced
to-read and understand the plays they pro-
duced, and this would entail fatigue; but
they would get used to the change, and in
the end benefit by it. The same law with
variations could apply to vaudeville acts and
minor shows ; while in the case of moving pic-
tures a high customs tariff on all but strictly
educational imported films would put the local
film-making business on a good wicket and
the writers of photo-plays on a better. With
regard to books and magazines, one idea
alone might be imported from the U.S.A. —
the idea which built the U.S.A. book trade
and gave the U.S.A. writer his chance. Let
every work of fiction sold in Australia be


set up and printed in Australia, and the
whole trick is done. The publisher then
begins to flourish; the importer goes out;
and the Australian author finds a market
for his wares. The benefit of these things
to the intellectual workers of the Common-
wealth needs no argument; and any person
who is not absolutely blind must be able to
see that such a course would tend to make
Australian taste, feeling and total mental
outlook fresh, vigorous and uncontaminated
by the inferior thought of other lands. The
world’s great books would still be read in
Australia because it would pay to reprint
them here; the world’s great plays would
still be produced in our theatres because
the premium would not prevent their suc-
cess ; but the cheap and inferior imports in
all departments would go out and leave us
cleaner and happier for their departure.
This right of the Australian people to
shape the growing mind and heart of their
own continent must be more and more in-
sisted on. A national soul means more than
high wages or cheap food; and successive
Ministries Avhich have looked at _ the
problem and passed it by without serious
consideration or effort have been not merely
casting the children’s bread to the dogs but
compelling the children themselves to eat
the remnants of biscuit the dogs have left.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Nigo Shoten, German Trader.
The observation made by this paper the
other day, that German mercantile agencies
would find means to evade a Customs tariff
directed entirely against themselves, has had
sudden confirmation from the despatch of the
Trade Commissioner in the lands where the
nations wear their eyes at a slope. The
information conveyed to the N.S.W. Pre-
mier shows that there are at least four Ger-
man firms in Yokohama and seven in Kobe
that are in the habit of calling themselves
by Japanese names when it suits their pur-
pose. Nippon has no law at present against
enemy trading; and as Australia is just now
importing particularly freely from that
country, there is good reason to suppose that
our cash is still going out to assist the_ Ger-
man to buy his tools of murder. The list of
the names of German firms trading under
a Jap disguise may fill commercial Australia
with momentary alarm; but all our efforts
to check enemy trading by a mere reference
to such names must prove abortive. If the
German doesn’t send in his wares from
Japan there are plenty of other places from
which he can pass them in ; and if we can’t
keep an effective watch during war-time our
chances in the succeeding days of peace won’t
be worth talking about. The idea of keep-
ing our doors half open and banging them
suddenly when anything with a Teutonic
look comes along is plain insanity. The
only possible way to be sure that German
goods don’t get in either now or hereafter is
by closing the doors altogether. But it
seems that our statesmen can’t or won’t
learn the simple lesson unless, the public l’ises
to enforce the instruction with an axe.
Exhausting the National Reserve of
Good Qualities.
It has been said that if it came to a vote the
trade unionists of Australia would be found
opposed to conscription. This is probably
untrue; but even if it is true, it. is only so
because of the number of good unionists and
better Australians who have gone to the
Front. This suggests another of the grave
dangers of the voluntary system. By calling
to those who are willing to carry the national
burden and leaving others to shirk, it drains
the country of its enthusiasm and strong
national feeling. Compulsory service makes
its selection on an entirely different basis;
and there is always a reserve of enthusiasm
and strong national feeling left until the last
file is called to the colors. Twenty good men
in a company can infuse zeal into the rest;
and under compulsory service those 20 good
men are practically always to be found at
the job, no matter whether they are called
early or late. The tendency of the voluntary
system, on the other hand, is to send the best
men out in one bunch, where they may be
wasted in the first big battle. Conscription
thus spreads the enthusiasm and the national
spirit equally over all drafts; under volun-
taryism the early drafts are surcharged with
those qualities, and the later drafts sadly
lack them. That of course is bad for the
army. And it is bad also for. the country,
since those who are left behind are very
liable to be poor representatives, of the whole
community, and ready to do things that the
nobler majority, would despise.
Government by Refusal to Work.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Hall finds the
road to his State bakery blocked by the
members of the trades unions concerned.
The barrier is as big and difficult as a
barbed-wire entanglement; and if the men
stick to their guns Hall’s scheme is out for
good. The move on the part of the unions is
anew, though not unexpected, development
of Labor rule. The P.L.L. shapes a plat-
form which is binding on all its members
and becomes the acknowledged policy of the
Ministry in power; but the Ministry doesn’t
obey orders, and the P.L.L. has never yet
been able to compel it to do so. Now it
appears that behind the Ministry and the
P.L.L. and every other piece of political
machinery are the trade unions themselves,
and they can do practically as they please
and make or mar any legislation, especially
of the industrial sort. If the bakers' won’t
bake State bread the Labor party can’t
make them do it, and after all Hall’s talk
and promises the scheme falls flat. But
this is only a boginping. If the Govern-
ment plans a- railway, borrows cash to make
it, and wins seats in the districts through
which the line is to pass on the strength
of a promise to see the job through, there
is still no sort of guarantee that there will
ever be a railway. The unions may refuse
to construct it. Again, the Federal Govern-
ment may go on squandering cash .on the
building of Uustberra and airange to shit.
Parliament there next year; but if the
clerks in every Government department
resolutely refuse to go there, and are backed
up by the rest of. the clerks in Australia,
Dustberra becomes a picturesque ruin be-
fore it has achieved the whole height and
glory of its failure as a habitable village.
Direct rule by the unions seems to be the
point of the compass towards which Labor
government is tending; and as the rule may
be by a different union on each day of the
week, the result must be a special brand of
anarchy or lunacy. Each union represents
a miserable minority of the people, as a
whole; yet the moment it has the choice to
do a thing or leave it alone it has the whip
hand over everybody else. Already we have
minority rule in that a majority of the
Labor party is generally a minority in Par-
liament ; and yet by the party system that
minority can carry measures and keep Min-
isters in power. The complete system, or
lack of system, under which we now per-
spire appears to consist of a minority at
each end and a large, flabby, talkative body
called the P.L.L. in the middle; and borne
down by this monstrosity the great bulk of
the democracy appears to be smothering for
lack of free movement and an occasional
whiff of common sense.
Two Fools Fight and a Nation Suffers.
The conflict between Pearce and Holman
on the drink question must mean a continu-
ance of the unsatisfactory state of affairs at
the military camps. It is an unmerited slur
on the vast majority of the soldier trainees
to assert, as is done by well-meaning enthu-
siasts among the teetotallers, that drunken-
ness is rampant. Still the fact remains that
there is much more of it than there ought
to be. There is enough of it to cause serious
trouble, to be subversive of military discip-
line and to bring unjust discredit on the
khaki uniform. The remedies are simple
and obvious; but because Pearce and
Holman cannot or will not agree on united
action the remedies are not applied.
Pearce is ignorant enough or wowserish
enough to assume that the manhood of Aus-
tralia can be satisfied with alleged stimu-
lants miscalled tea and soft drinks concocted
of all sorts of abominations —both gastro-
intestinal disturbers and destroyers of the
worst class. Hence alcoholic liquor must
not be brought into any of the camps in
jar, bottle or barrel. But it may be and is
brought in in large quantities in men's
stomachs, to the detriment of those stomachs
and the disgrace of the Australian uniform.
Pearce has these thousands of men so con-
centrated that they might be controlled and
satisfied (with few exceptions) in respect of
their . favorite brand of “poison.” If
the recommendations of officers and of the
professional commission which recently
reported on the subject were adopted and
wet canteens were established, the men
could command reasonable supplies of liquor
which would have the virtue—negative
though it may he —of being pure and un-
adulterated. But Pearce will not have a
wet canteen, so the men are turned
adrift, thousands at a time, to patronise
the pubs, at which, because Holman will
not apply requisite restriction or regulation,
they may get unlimited supplies of liquors
that in many cases are vile sophistications.
It would be the simplest thing in the world
to manage a wet canteen so as to keep the
men well within the bounds of sobriety.
Rules could be made and enforced so that
every man who wanted it could get the
liquor that suited his taste, but “so much
and no more,” certain elasticity in this
respect being allowed contingent on whether
the men had been engaged on light or
arduous work. This would be Pearce’s end
of the stick. At the other end Holman
should say that in his drinking palaces—
and dens —no man in soldier’s uniform
should be served with intoxicating liquor
after (say) 6 p.m. No man of the world
(which seemingly the clay-footed Pearce is
not) would be asinine enough to assume that
these means would put an absolute stop to
drunkenness; but the combination would
have such an effect on desire and temptation
as to minimise it. Surely to try to achieve
such a desirable result the experiments are
worth the test. Pearce is certainly con-
sistent in his violent antipathy to alcohol;
but consistency observed in conflict to the
dictates of common-sense is hardly commend-
able as a virtue. Holman cannot boast
that consistency is the star jewel in his
crown. Like an irresponsible fanatic he
declares in one breath that drink is a
greater enemy to our manhood than is
Prussian militarism, and in the next that he
will do nothing, or next to nothing, to pre-
vent the men whom we are training at such
great cost for the protection of our lives and
liberties having opportunities to swill the
accursed stuff like swine. It may amuse
Pearce and Holman to hurl half-bricks of
sarcasm at each other, but their personal
gratification ought not to be paramount
against dealing with an admitted evil.

Damn Posterity! Lend Us a Million!
Maoriland listened the other day to Joe
Ward justifying the policy of the Cold Hash
Government in (1) sponging on John Bull
for £500,000 a month to meet the local
military expenditure, and (2) turning the
whole cost of the war into debt. He ex-
pounded his views on the subject with mag-
nificent nebulosity, but so far as this paper
can make head or tail of it the yarn came
to this: That if the Government borrowed
locally the rate of interest would go up;
that John Bull had not mentioned being
in difficulties about finding £0,000,000 a year
for Maoriland; that local money should be
kept in business, lou also observed that
“there would be great changes after the war,
Which’, though he was unable to forecast
their character, he was satisfied would be
met in a spirit of sacrifice by the'people,
who, recognising the enormous issues at
stake, would unflinchingly meet all require-
ments for the good of the community as a
whole.” He might just as well have turned
14 handsprings. Since the war started
Maoriland has made enormous profits. They
are . mostly war profits. Her surplus of
exports over imports during the past 12
months is just on £10,000,000. Bank de-
posits have leaped upwards by £4,000.000
and savings bank investments by £2,500,000.
A local loan for £2,000,000 for works was
recently over-subscribed. The exports for
the year ending September realised
£4,000,000 more than the exports in the
preceding year. Yet, in spite of this irre-
futable evidence of the country’s ability to
pay for its share in the war, Ward goes
ahead filching half a million a month from
the worried and harassed Old Man, and sign-
ing bills for the baby to wrestle with later
on. Such skulking away from an obvious
duty is a scandal on the country and a
shame upon the people who tolerate it.
♦
On the Throne of Genghis Khan.
The sudden energy displayed by China a
few years ago when the Mancliu Empire
was smashed and a republic established with
frock coats and bell-toppers, seems to have
spent its force. Yuan Siiih Kai has be-
come Emperor on a constitutional basis, and
on all appearances the large yellow portion
of Asia will settle down into the old rut,
cultivate its rice and muddle along for an-
other thousand years or so with any kind of
Government that may be able to establish
itself. Yet there are points about the change
from republicanism to monarchy which may
bring us trouble. However limited the
power of the person wearing the gold hat,
his office gives him great opportunities for
the exercise of personal ambition; and while
his headship of the nation may in theory be
merely of the ornamental sort, in. practice
all the alleged limitations may be cast aside
and the Caesar in name become a Cassar in
fact. What makes this, the more likely in
the case of China is that the country has so
long been accustomed to despotic rule and so
much in the habit of listening to a com-
manding voice that' Yuan Sinn Kai or one
of bis successors may take hold of the
national attitude of humble obedience and
use it to further and develop his own schemes.
China in Asia is pretty much what Germany
was in Europe, but with the difference
that the Boss Chow could call to his stand-
ard seven or eight men for every one that
lias responded to Wilhelm’s whistle. Re-
publican China was a tolerably safe proposi-
tion because it stood for an attempt to make
democrats out of an utterly undemocratic
people, and the process seemed as if it would
supply all needed entertainment both for
statesmen and citizens for centuries to come.
Monarchical China —particularly when the
new monarch is a political person of ability
—offers no guarantees for the happiness of
the world. At any moment old China,
heavy, slow, patient and servile, may become
identified with China’s Emperor, quick,
active, enthusiastic and ambitious. The
Government of the Manchu didn’t matter,
and its imperial topknot was only a pictur-
esque sound on the lips of diplomats ; but the
new monarchy may matter in that it nomi-
nally places in the hands of one man the
greatest machine in the world. How far his
grip upon its levers may remain nominal re-
mains to be seen.
Of course any old carrot is good enough for
the Holman Government to toss the public
between loans. But that Fair Bent Bill
looks about the most decayed vegetable on
record. After years of promising and blith-
ering through the top of its hat and pro-
ducing fake schemes for “solving the rent
problem” which had to be hastily dropped
down the sewer, Holman and his gang have
at last redeemed their pledge and made good
on the Labor platform. And this is what
the Bill provides : —•
By a special court rents on houses up to £3 a
week may be reviewed on application. The rent to
be fixed shall be assessed, at the rate charged for
bank overdraft plus 2A per cent., on such a figure as
a bona fide purchaser would pay for the land and at
what it would cost to build a similar house as the
one in occupation, with additions for repairs, depre-
ciation, insurance, rates, taxes and all the rest of it.
It only now remains for liard-up tenants to
rush forward with large numbers of expert
witnesses and accountants and find out what
will happen in the way of a reduction of the
cost of living. In the meantime Trades and
Labor Councils will be able to get the Bill
framed and have copies distributed as
samples of the sort of dope that may be
secured after prolonged agitation.
“Verdad” : Re “Jaques’s” suggestion (B.
16/12/’ls) that different colors should be
used for open and crossed cheques. I wisli
to suggest still another safeguard, to pre-
vent the amount of a cheque being altered.
I know there are various machines for this
purpose, hut they are expensive, and not
one private person in a hundred uses them.
My suggestion is simply to adopt the device
that most South American banks employ.
Along the top of the cheque is a column
of figures, printed sideways, the top of the
column being at the top left corner, and the
bottom at the top right corner. For our
currency the figures could be 1,3, 5,7, 10,
15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, etc., up
to say 10,000—the values rising more rapidly
towards the end. Now, suppose you draw
a cheque for f9-odd. You fill in the cheque
as usual, and also run your pen through
the 10 and all higher figures in the column
along the top. Better still is to cut out the
ten, using knife or scissors, and making a
Y cut in the top edge. That cheque cannot
be altered to £9O because the 10 being cut
out shows the value must be below that
figure. Is there any reason other than
“Asquism” why the banks won’t adopt the
idea? (“Asquism” copyrighted—it means
conservatism, inertia, wait and see, have a

The Post Office deficit of £629,722 on the
year’s working is the price of loafing, muddle
and inefficiencjL Webster, the new P.M.G.,
who declares that the “management will
have to adopt more business-like methods,”
suggests that telegrams may cost more and
telephones collect a heavier toll, and that
even the postage rate may be increased.
But the real trouble is not that the revenue
is too little, but that the expenditure is too
great. Some of the men described by the
P.M.G. as having been better treated than
any similar class of officials in the world
deserve all they get. They are capable,
resourceful and energetic, and but for them
the post offices would have burst long ago
with accumulated mail matter and incapa-
city. But there are others; and you can
get the best view of them in the suburban
offices, which are the slowest, weariest and
most ill-informed things in Australia. The
public is long-suffering; but its patience in
regard to the postal service is exhausted, and
it will now stand behind any Minister who
does his duty by either making these wasters
jump to attention or cutting them clean
out of the pay-sheets. They are seriously
jeopardising that plank of the Labor plat-
form which declares for the public owner-
ship of public utilities, and a Labor Minister
who is true to the principles of his party
will not trifle with such enemies any longer.
■———■—
One of the dead things which Webster,
P.M.G., ought to resurrect is the book the
telegraph boy used to carry to check his de-
livery of telegrams. Any day you can see
lads in uniform loafing wearily about the
thoroughfares or hanging around the windows
of shops, and there is a lot of need for a
system which will explain what they dicl
with the messages they carry and how long
they took to do it. At busy seasons a good
many telegrams never get through at all,
and efforts to trace them are too slow and
cumbersome. The boy to whose care they
are entrusted ought to be compelled to bring
back a signature for every one he is supposed
to deliver. The Post Office in its wisdom en-
trusts some of its most important work to
irresponsible nippers, but it might at least
see to it that the discharge of that work
isn’t entirely left to the nipper’s own dis-
honesty arid immature judgment.

CREDULOtfs, charity-giving old England has
had her leg pulled and her purse emptied
by smart" foreigners once more. The Eng-
lish nurseryman lias been hard hit
by the war. But the trade made no
complaint until an allegedly-Dutch bulb-
merchant wrote a pitiful advertising
appeal to the Times, begging for orders,
and another Holland firm sent over cata-
logues; with a slip offering English buyers a
special 10 per cent, discount which would
be given by the-firm to the Prince of Wales’s
Fund ! The Huddersfield Corporation, swal-
lowed the bait, and £IOOO in good English

to whine ; at advertising rates. Curiousjy
enough the Times declined Bk publish ’flic
counterblast prepared by the Horticultural
Traders’ Association, so the appeal to Eng-
lish garden-folk for a little practical patri-
otism had to be flung at them through the

The Land that Calls.
“McNorth” goes sailing':—
The great 24ft. tide was near its top when we
slipped out of Darwin in the lugger to the accom-
paniment of the auxiliary engine’s regular beat. The
sun was just rising, and all to the eastward the
shimmering sea lay like beaten gold.
We slid past the anchored pearling luggers, past
the China steamer lying at the wharf, round the roekv
points where the automatic lighthouses wink ever-
lastingly, past the silent, shaded pools in the little
bays, and, leaving behind the high walls of the
plateau on which Darwin is built, we headed for
the harbor’s mouth.
It was July. But not the July of the so-called
temperate zones, when men toil the harder to pur-
chase clothes to keep their bodies warm! In this
kindly land nature made one comfortable as a
matter of course. Here were we skimming over the
turquoise-tinted water with the warm breeze gently
fanning our cheeks, a clear blue sky overhead, and
the certainty that to-morrow would be a replica of
to-day. The “dead” of winter! I thought of the un-
fortunates who live in the South and hurry along
cold, wind-swept streets, or crouch over fires in poky
houses; and I laughed with the joy of life.
Our itinerary took us some hundreds of miles
from Darwin along the much-indented eastern coast
of the Territory. We sailed through the passage
between the Vernons, where the tide runs like a
river. Melville, the great island which sprawls across
the top of the map, lay on our port side. We
traversed narrow passages, and the crocodiles we
thought were bits of driftwood lying on the beach
slipped lazily into the water as they heard our
engine’s beat. At night we lay around the deck in
pyjamas and swapped lies, while the ambidextrous
skipper balanced a whisky in one hand and steered
with the other. We would lie half-awake and listen
to the chanting of the native on the look-out as he
“sang” some camp-fire ditty in order to let the Old
Man know he was awake and keeping faithful watch.
And all the time the long, uninhabited coast of our
inheritance lay on the starboard side. We passed
the remains of the Australia, which lie a jaggied
heap on the reef near Cape Don. We sat in the
shade of the tamarind trees planted 75 years ago by
the military settlers at Port Essington. The glorious
sun looked down on us from an eternally azure sky,
and we felt that life was good.
We entered sheltered harbors where the .water was .
so deep that a vessel drawing 25ft. could lay a gang-'
plank to the shore at low water. We saw big rivers
with deep approaches. Low spring tides revealed
acres of the finest oysters we had ever met. We
shot ducks, turkeys, pigeons, geese, pigs and all
manner of game. The seas teemed with fish. At
Croker .Island we got 14cwt. in one haul, and had
to put in two days repairing the net. We saw
sufficient fertile soil to feed a continent, and we
gazed at the edge of pastoral areas stretching from
the little-known coast to the still less-known
interior.
Yet in all those hundreds of miles of coast, in
spite of the fertile soil, the natural harbors, the
salubrious climate and all the other gifts proffered
by a bountiful nature, there is not one white man.
There is not even a house, or any attempt at settle-
ment whatever. Nothing but nomadic aborigines—-
nature’s gentlemen, who neither toil nor spin.
And away down south people struggle, and pay big
prices for small slices of land no more fertile than
this, in a changeful and, on the whole, miserable
climate. Burdened with the curse of centralisation
they continue to herd together in the mud and slush
and drought of the southern latitudes, and let the
clear blue skies of the sunny North look down on a
fertile, empty land.
Just a few days’ steam lie Java and all the Orient,
with their crowded, land-hungry populations gazing
earnestly at the map, and asking their various gods
if the dog-in-the-manger policy is a fair thing.

Freedom’s Advt.—“Wanted: Men to
Fight.”
It was a good fight at Gallipoli, anyhow,
with the muddle in conception and the blun-
dering in execution redeemed by the splendid
courage of the troops. It was not our Bill-
jim’s fault that he didn’t win through. No
soldier ever carried himself with a finer
courage or grappled more resolutely with the
enemy. And because Australians have the
best of reasons for pride in the fighting quali-
ties of the lads they sent out, they have the
best of reasons, also, for acute disappointment
that the cords of the campaign should have
been held by hands so nerveless and con-
trolled by minds so unimaginative. From
first to last the whole business of not getting
to Constantinople was fumbled, and while
the army hung on to the peninsula by the
tips of its fingers there was more fumbling
somewhere else, with the result of the mess
now on hand in Servia and thereabouts. It
is no use pretending that the mess is only a
little one. Whatever may be the truth
about the alleged intention of the Hun to
make a thrust at Egypt—and on this point
Australia is getting only occasional scraps
of misinformation —and whatever may be the
strength of the German arms around Mace-
donia and the intentions of the Greek and
the Roumanian, the situation, if not abso-
lutely critical, is at any rate such as to give
the greatest emphasis to the call for more
men. All the current guff about the Ger-
man being hard-up for recruits and food and
money, of the Hungarians becoming restive,
of the Bulgars and Turks being unwilling-
participants in the struggle, is not worth a
moment’s consideration. The obvious facts
are the things to go by, and these are that
German troops are in Belgium, France and
Russia; that Servia has been blotted out, her
army scattered to the winds and her civil
population driven a wretched rabble into the
mountains; that the Turk and the Bulgar
have not yet had a hole put in them. To
reverse this position is only possible by bring-
ing greatly-increased pressure to bear on the
places where it is wanted, and until this is
done victory for the Allies will not be within
measurable distance. The German cannot
win the war. But between winning and
losing there are many convenient points—-
for the German. But there are none for the
Allies. Their job is to win. And the plain
duty of every man who can strike a blow for
human freedom is to roll up and hit—quickly.
The sham that we were winning without this
extra help has been too long dangled in front
of us.
So Long, Anzac!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So long! We’ve had a very pleasant stay;
We’re rather sorry we must go away ;
You made us very welcome, cobber Turk !
But Dad now wants us for some other work.
And though we say farewell,
Somewhere this side of Hell,
We hope to meet you, mate, some other day!
We’re leaving quite a lot of little things
behind ;
Some that you wanted badly you may find —
Long rows of trenches that you couldn’t
reach,
Neat, dug-out townships, and our bathing-
beach ;
And, with a friendly trust,
We leave, because we must,
A lot of neatly-numbered graves to mind.
And if we send you some strange seeds to
sow
Over that lone Australian dust, we know
You’ll do it for a fighting brother’s sake;
So that a strange Australian Spring will
break
On your iEgean shore,
And so, for evermore,
Our story into gold and green will grow.
Bach Spring its gift of blossom will bestow
Upon those exiled souls that rest below.
On our Australian Anzac will unfold
The wattle’s radiant canopy of gold ;
To the yEgean Spring
The manuka will fling
From Maoriland her fragrance and her snow.
Yet now that we the wallaby must take,
Sundowners still, our hearts with memories
ache;
So many chaps that came with us to call
Will roll their swags no more.... Oh damn
it all —•
That’s done. We cannot wait.
A Merry Christmas, mate!
So long, Anzac, we haven’t time to shake!

“The Girl in the Taxi” is only lingering
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, until “So Long,
Letty,” is ready to start on Boxing Day.
One of the lightest shows that ever came to
town, “The Girl” will always be remem-
bered because of her music and Field Fisher’s
Alexis, the head-waiter. Fisher makes him
a sort of soup-bishop, and his shocked pro-
fessional attitude when the blue-eyed society
Parsifal comes trembling down the stairs
to. keep his midnight-supper appointment
with the other fellow’s girl is something to
remember when life is duller than usual.
Likewise his air of hopeless gravity when
the dainty lady is compiling the horribly
expensive supper she is going to make the
young man. pay for. Gwen Hughes is “The
Girl” this time and Dorothy Brunton the
graceful Suzanne, while Cecil Bradley trifles
nicely as Jacqueline. W. I-I. Rawlins
repeats his amusing version of the unctuous
Baron Dauvray, and the other principals
appear in their old places. A society tango
by Sydney and Daisy Yates deserves honor-
able mention, and MacCunn’s orchestra does
its duty like a good musician.
There, isn’t a “crook” in either of the
“Twin Beds” that are now on exhibition,
direct from the U.S.A., at Sydney Criterion.
And the only detective never comes into the
bedroom. Of course everybody else does.
The farce can be put into a very few words.
Act One: Wifey wants twin beds. Hubby
wants to escape from other husbands in his
flat, who all flirt with wifey. Act Two:
They shift to a new flat. So do the others.
All the rooms are furnished alike. Hubby
has to go to his club. Wifey goes to bed.
The wrong hubby, drunk, comes to the wrong
room, and he goes to bed —the other bed.
Act Three: Both wake up. Wifey crosses
to the other bed, and says, in that piteous
voice that every hubby knows, “Har-wy,
I’m cold !” It is the wrong Har-wy. The
real Har-wy arrives. The wrong Har-wy
hides —in the linen basket, in one twin-bed,
in the other _ twin-bed, under the bed, des-
perately trying to gather some clothes
together to make his escape.
“THE GIRL IN THE TAXI,” AT
SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Pomarel (Chas. Workman) and. Lieutenant
Rene (Paul Plunket).
The farce is almost a moving picture:
the business is infinitely, more engrossing
than the dialogue. For 20 minutes the audi-
ence watches, breathless, first the going to
bed of a nice, good little wife, and then the
going to bed of a drunk. But the film is cut
off just when it begins to get really exciting.
In that 20 minutes the only sounds heard
come from the gasping gallery. But
the going to bed is quite—well, quite artis-
tically managed. It is the sort of play that
you could take your grandmother to. Don’t
worry about her morals if her heart is quite
normal. The staging is a delight, and the
business extraordinarily complicated and
brilliantly devised. And the moral is quite
sound : “There’s something about sleeping in
his own bed that makes a man feel far too
independent.”
The imported company proved absolutely
at home in their beds. Hale Hamilton, the
original “Wallingford,” lacks the personal
charm of Fred Niblo, but proves himself an
easy and delightful comedian. The love-
making passages between him and Myrtle
Tannehill are charming. Hale Hamilton has,
however, a part that does not enable us to
judge his full artistic equipment. He is
overshadowed by Myrtle Tannehill, a youth-
ful, attractive and convincingly natural
comedienne, whose voice makes even her
“Har-wy” and her “huhhruhy!” beautiful.
She is, emphatically, a find, worth all the
tremendously long and exciting train
journeys that Hugh Ward had to
make to discover her. She possesses
the rare attribute (in wives) of going
to sleep gracefully, just as Hale Ham-
ilton affords an object-lesson (to hus-

CRITERION.
Hale Hamilton discovers Signor Monti (John
Ardizoni) and Andrew Larkin (Donald
Bowles) hiding in the family bedroom.
bands) in managing to look dignified in
striped pyjamas. John Ardizoni takes the
part of a temperamental Italian tenor, and
is referred to by his jealous wife as “My
Dago picture-puzzle” and “My pie-face,” and
in other terms of endearment. He did his best
to make-up to these love-names ; but though
his “drunk” business when undressing is
pleasantly absurd, he is not a naturally
humorous drunk, and in the third act he has
nothing to do but hide. Maybe he was
chosen for the sake of his voice. Mildred
Warren, in an important part as the maid,
Norah, impresses the audience as a clever
and out-of-the-ordinary comedienne. Celia
Ghiloni, who scorns dramatic subtlety, is
patchily brilliant in her Celia Ghiloni way.
Nancye Stewart, as the third wife, conscien-
tiously fills her minor rQle. Donald Bowles
is to be congratulated on his production of
a farce that is chiefly production, and on his
absurd characterisation of a nervous hus-
band. The thing itself, by Margaret Mayo,
is a relief from the dry-goods from the U.S.
that have wearied Sydney audiences of late.
But, if it must go on importing our theat-
rical fare, the management might use a little
discretion in altering the dialogue to Aus-
tralian comprehension. There was one word,
a perfectly innocent word in Amurrican,
used on the opening night, which, judged by
the way an excited girl in the gallery re-
peated it in a hysterical shriek, has quite
another meaning in Australian.

“Dick Whittington” is the Sydney panto,
this Christmas. The old favorite was due
to arrive at the remodelled Adelphi when
this Bulletin was in the press, so for the
present the paper accepts the enterprising
George Marlow’s claim that the show is
“sumptuously beautiful and hilariously
funny,” that there are “brilliant effects,
glorious ballets and rousing novelties,” and
that Richard and the puss are supported by
“an irresistible army of clever comedians
and beautiful girls”—with other adjectives,
calculated to set any newspaper ablaze in
this tindery summer weather. Carrie Moore
is principal boy and Dan Thomas the dame ;
and Caroline, at any rate, isn’t in need of
any more, adjectives if she does anything
like as well as she has been doing lately.

The Tivoli Follies (1915-16 team) are
still advertising themselves at Sydney head-
quarters in the best possible way, i.e., by con-
verting paying visitors into unpaid publicity-
agents. The frequent man who doesn’t care
a d —n or a h—r-ng or a d—sh about what
the papers say lends a willing enough ear to
the trusted friend who tells him solemnly
that the show queened by Vera Pearce is All
Right. Then comes the wife’s ultimatum
that she is “sick of the house,” and the old
humbug winks and makes a martyr of him-
self by taking her to a show that he has
been aching to get to ever since the hon.
publicity-agent aforesaid got to work on his
ear.

Sydney cinema-theatres are putting their
programmes through a quick-change act be-
tween this and next Bulletin. “The
Hypocrites” and the nude female known to
the police as “Naked Truth,” after doing
weeks of big business at a tall tariff at the
Palace, go to the Empress to show at popular
prices, adjourning to the Crystal Palace on
Christmas Day so that Joseph may have
room to pitch his tent in the Land of Egypt.
Meantime, Hilda Spong gets all the lime-
light at the Crystal Palace in “Divorced.” a
five-act thriller in which the popular Aus-
tralian actress shows to the best advan-
tage. The offering at the Lyric is “Up from
the Depths,” a trawling expedition into the
underworld, which will be displaced on
Christmas Day by Paul Rainey’s African-
hunt pictures. A further instalment of the
“Clutching Hand” serial is at the Colonial,
where on Saturday a two-hours’ tour of the
world by the All-Red Route will start at
regular intervals. (Fares, Ist class, 6d. ;
2nd, 3d.) . On Boxing Day a new pro-
gramme will be presented at each theatre
mentioned.

The trial gallop of the “Mother Goose”
panto at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) last Satur-
day suggested a shapely flier that hasn’t been
trained to go two miles, or a pudding that suf-
fers from a lack of currants on the lee side.
The show was exceptionally promising in the
early stages of its journey, and sweetest in
the slices that were served first. Judicious
cutting, rearrangement and writing-up in the
long and dreary dialogue passages should
make the dish equal to the ordinary
requirements of a sea-
son ; but the trouble with a witless panto, as
a rule, is to arouse it to a full consciousness
of its original sin, and persuade it that one
good gag deserves another. In Saturday’s
big blobs of dialogue there was hardly one
pungent wheeze or ingenious gag. Joy stood
aside and meditated whilst the imported
comedians talked. Some of their conversa-
tion smacked of impropriety ; none of it was
humorous. The patter of rain on the roof
would have been more interesting than the
rain of patter on the stage. But presumably
the comedians know how to utter jokes when
the material is put into their mouths, so the
weakness of the panto thus far—its want of
stamina —may be charged to the book. The
lines are wretchedly thin. If any more clothes
were hung upon them they would break.
* * * *
( Now for the good things. The singing of
Gladys Moncrieff as a fairy is an example to
the lady mortals present, and her opening
altercation with a tall and tuneful demon
(Charles Howard) leaves only an encore to be
desired. The Toy Village, with all the kiddie
and chorus effects therein, and the tornado that
fills the air with cabbages and confusion, is
a lively scene. The Dream Girl careering
through blackened space is a happy new dear,
whilst the illuminated swing device is an ad-
vancement on previous displays, especially as
regards Maud Fane, who nearly touches the
dress-circle with her moving smile. And a
ballet of coins of the realm and paper money
ends the first act with an assurance of finan-
cial success. In the second half a grotesque
horse, whose limbs are the legs of Le Brun
and George Smith, scores a legitimate
triumph, and later on a revolving cabin and
a pair of “comedy bump” acrobats minister
to the eternal public craving for acts of vio-
lence. Also there is a nice little ballet, intro-
ducing Maggie Dickinson as a quick-change
dancer, and a moderately picturesque finale.
Otherwise the second part is mostly a series
of opportunities for the new principals to
make bricks without straw, and seemingly
they can’t do it. Even catchy songs are
denied them. Nor is there a striking per-
sonality amongst the men.
* * * *
The principal boy (Lilian De Venny) is
merely an impressively tall study in brown
tights and tunic. Her singing voice comes
short of expectation, and her acting is quite
perfunctory at times. On the other hand, the
principal girl (Maud Fane, late of the “Court
Cards”) is snappy and melodious; but her
vivacity has no chance to speak of. Harry
Farrow in the name part—which is the dame
part—never gets a good hold of the audience.
Victor Kelly, as the son and heir, is an ener-
getic fall-about performer in whom there is
no natural drollery. Arthur Reynolds,
another newcomer, gives a stodgy impersona-
tion of a baron in kilts and a clear enuncia-
tion of some “nutty” song words; Albert
Felino has the thankless part of the Goose
that drops golden eggs about; and Rupert
Darrell’s thin sham nose is shaped like a
pothook, as in many previous years. Cole-
man is responsible for several well-painted

“The Three Musketeers” threatens to run
into the New Year at Melbourne Princess’s,
for the action of the melodrama is rapid in
its crudity, and the heroism of Julius Knight
has a keen eye to business. Julius’s stage
version of the ancient fiction seems quite
a masterpiece of cheap sensation. He
just comes along on an angular steed and
attaches himself to a job-lot of musketeers
in red velveteen, and then he undertakes to
get the Queen’s necklace from a doleful Duke
of Buckingham before Miss Olive Wilton
can intercept him in the chase. And when
he does get the glittering stage jewels, leav-
ing Olive Wilton to suppose that he didn’t,
Cardinal Richelieu is made to appear a
libellous liar, and tjie pretty Queen poses as
a picture of injured innocence which she
certainly isn’t. Personally the Queen makes
no bid for the audience’s sympathy, but sym-
pathy is thrust upon her by the other cat,
who hides behind a screen in order to learn
the truth about Her Majesty’s little indis-
cretion. As for Richelieu, he was born (in
the drama) to be invariably flummoxed, con-
sequently the gallery reckons him a real
bad lot compared with the King. The great-
est of all sins is to be invariably flummoxed.
A matinee of “Three Musketeers” will tran-
spire on Christmas Day.

“Stop Your Nonsense,” presented at Mel-
bourne King’s last Saturday, is described
as an “amusical play,” but soon reveals that
the label is the alius of a vaudeville enter-
tainment which combines one or two special
turns with the amiable pretences of several
mummers who have been better employed in
other forms of stage work. Tom Shelford,
Frank Bradley and their accomplices do not
appear to be specially gifted for, songandance
frivolities of this innocuous character, and
their artless endeavors often give the pro-
ceedings an air of polite melancholy which
even the ribald voice of Jack Kearns fails
to dispel. In the second act, which is
undisguised vaudeville, the humor is more
worthy of attention. The turns of the
Oswells and the Leteens are good revised
versions of old familiar acts, and the panto-
mime of “The Lovers Surprised” is enjoy-
able. Bradley figures as an aristocratic
connoisseur of “sweet seventeens” ; Shelford
is a knut of limited experience; Slierras is
more like an absence than a presence as a
dramatic author of many failures. Henry
J. Ford makes valiant attempts to suit his
actions to the language of a restless theat-
rical manager; and Edward Landor’s quiet
drollery lifts an insignificant property-man
out of an undistinguished background. Of
the ladies, Miss Irma Caron appears satis-
factorily in the modest role of Dolly Gibbs,
and Miss Florence Fanning splutters ener-
getically as her worried and moneyed mamma.
Also Clarice Hardwick dances at intervals,
and Miss Vera Kearns brings her blonde
charms into notice while warbling her serio-
chronic items. “Stop Your Nonsense” will
be . the evening bill until further notice.
Daily matinees will be devoted to Beaumont
Smith’s adaptation of “Seven Little Aus-
tralians.”

one more week. Meanwhile the corpse of
that never-seen, person will be carted away
in a barrel, behind the scenes, every evening,
and “Kick-in” will regale the public with
the same feast of Yankee thieves’ slang and
flow of “cops’ ” jargon as heretofore. Under
Fire,” an up-to-date war drama, comes due
at the Royal on January 1 next year.

Herbert Brooks is the big item at Mel-
bourne Bijou this week. Herbert reveals
his qualities as a card-trickster and steel-
trunk mystifier in an original act that is
crowded with language—Yankee brand.
Dulcie Hall, a jiu-jitsu expert of comely con-
tours, provides a brilliant turn. Dora Ober-
man, a new soprano, is an engaging 30
minutes ; and the Goolmans continue to make
their alarm-clock sonata the interesting fea-
ture of their musical show. As regards
the Hamilton Stewart difo, mentioned last
week, they have become almost unintellgible
in a fatiguing niggah absurdity entitled “The
Soldier and the Suffragette.”

The “Australian National Theatre,” which
hides .modestly at the Davidsons’ place at
Oakleigh (Melb.) and charges nothing at
the door, had its toy season of two nights
last week. The three one-acters (“juie
Return,” “Experiment,” and “The Moon
Child”) were run off successfully on the
stage which looks out into the Davidson
garden. Wind, trees and stars were all real,
but a chorus of bracken was merely prettily
human, the august Property Man having
omitted to make the vegetation vocal. “The
Return” proved to be a comedy of the Steele
Rudd type, but with Mum wearing the halo
of honest work instead of good old roaring
Dad. Miss Peggy Mudge played the name-
part capably. “The Moon Child” revealed
itself as a fanciful aboriginality built on
“Peter Pan” lines. “The Experiment” gave
Mrs. E. C. Davidson an opportunity to play
an invalid cleverly. The sick woman has
settled down to pathetic beef-tea and gruel
when she chances to overhear the doctor’s
frank statements to her daughter. Where-
upon the surprised patient takes up her bed
and throws it into the middle of the next
block.

The Adelaide Repertory Theatre finished
its 1915 season with a clever rendering of
the old Ibsen play, “An Enemy of the
People.” This, of course, is Ibsen-for-tlie-
young-beginner, and might be a success in
any “regular” theatre. The chaff about
municipal reformers and reactionaries hits
hard and hits all round; and there are
plunges into simple humor, as where the
chief reformer, having suffered damage to
his wardrobe, admits that a man should
never wear his best trousers when he goes

forth to battle for freedom and truth. James
Anderson brought out effectively all the
sides of this character, including the strain
of eccentricity— not to say madness—which
is necessary in the ideal iconoclast. Ray
Walsh was quietly scoring all the time as
the head of the moss-grown opposition, the
small boys were cleverly played by real boys
—in fact, there was not a weak spot, right
down to “Uproar at the Back” and “Shouts

Adelaide Royal gets busy. A Villiers
Arnold revue is coming in, and Potash and
his Hebrew partner are to follow closely.
Meanwhile Moffat and his delightful “Scrape

The story is no great thing, but the char-
acterisation is delightful. This writer —who
is no Scotchman—has known at least four
people who move again in this play. Also
much quiet and legitimate fun is got out of
the 1874 costumes. The Tivoli has seen
the end of a long dramatic season, which
began as an experiment and has run for
months. Nellie Bramley had her big chance

with an axe. West’s pictures show Cham-

AT POVERTY POINT.
Drifted back to Australia on the flowing
tide of war, dramatic soprano Elsie Davis
(Mrs. Philippo Navaretti), sometime of the
Melbourne Uni. Conservatorium. With a
sound preliminary training 10 years ago
the singer went to Milan, where she spent
a couple of years “passing” operas with a
maestro, travelling at intervals with an
operatic co. Engagements followed in
Stockholm (opera), London (Landon
Ronald’s concerts in the Albert Hall), and
Italy (opera), with presently another visit
to England. Zeppelins were abroad in those
days, and Australia called. There are two
children, who speak with an Austritalian
accent; and husband Philippo, a viticul-
turist, is also with the party. Mrs. Navar-
etti presently intends to seek a job from her
old Conservatorium, the Italian newspapers
having provided her with a hundred yards
of unimpeachable testimonial. The fact that
she is an Australian will nowadays hardly
be a bar. Sari Bair did that for us.
“J.F.H.”: Australia’s old friend Bouci-
cault, who in partnership with Brough gave
playgoers some of their finest treats, is re-
suming management after a long absence
from that business. For 14 years he has
been the London “producer” for Charles
Frolnnan, who was submarined in the Lusi-
tania. Frohman made no pretence to art or
culture, looking at plays solely with regard
to their possibilities of profit. Having
acquired a play he handed it over to Dot
Boucicault, whom he paid a handsome salary
for rehearsing it and putting it on the
stage in the best and most attractive style.
Dot’s _ occupation is now gone, so he is
reverting to his old Australian role. He
has taken a lease of the New Theatre from
Sii- Charles Wyndham, and put up bills to
start on Christmas Eve with “Peter Pan,”
a sure and safe card to play. His Peter
will be Unity More, a pretty Irish girl who
has scored in revue work at the Hippo-
drome. After that there will be a new
comedy by Maughan and a “fantastic cos-
tume play” by Richard Dehar; and Barrie
and Pinero have promised they will write
new pieces for him. So Dot starts his new
venture under the most auspicious circum-
stances, and with the blessing of the Times,
which anticipates that “Mr. Boucicault will
succeed in filling the gap caused in theatrical
circles by the death of his former chief.”
“M.P.A.” writes biographically :
Arthur Francis Russell was the third well-known
Melbourne picture showman to pass out in a couple
of years. The others were Erskine Scott, manager
for West’s, the brightest advt.-writer in the game,
and J. A. Miller, one of the original members of
West’s syndicate, son of old “J.J.” “Doc” Russell,
the third, was the son of a Dunolly (Vic.) chemist.
Though by instinct declared in recent pars to have
been a showman, he certainly had the dental bug at
a very early age, because he filled a tooth for a
schoolmate when he was no more than 12. He
dabbled first in sleight of hand, and as “Prof.
Francis” was a skilful performer at the Sydney
Waxworks. Settling- down in Melbourne at his dental
business he introduced his show methods, and pulled
the best part of a cigar-box full of teeth every
morning, all on the free ticket. In his early efforts
with Hoyt’s Pictures his friends and rival showmen
never thought he would make good, but his tenacity
pulled him well out of it and put him at the head
of the finest picture house in Australasia. In 1912
he financed the present writer to go to Ireland in
quest of material for the successful “Ireland To-
Day” show. Another of his ideas was the “Naval
War,” produced at Melbourne Glaciarium last Easter,
an open-air scheme which the tricky Victorian
weather forced indoors. In general make-up the late
“Doc” was a solid block of a man who could “use
’em” well. He treated the teeth of all the pugs
since Peter Jackson’s time, and by his death theatri-
cal pros., pugs, and bohemians of all sorts have lost
a practical friend.
Carrie Haase, who left Australia for
Europe some years ago, had eyes and a voice
that helped her to gain a place in the London
theatrical world. Melbourne will soon have
an opportunity of seeing what she has
learned, as she is preparing an Australian
pageant play which threatens to be alto-
gether unique.
“C. Ockney”: So the long-time Gaiety
favorite, Connie Ediss, is to make her first
appearance at Christmas in the new Wil-
liamson musical production in Sydney. The
firm hasn’t caught her very young, but that
cannot be helped. If she retains only a
portion of the humor that helped to make
a dozen gaiety pieces a dozen successes, she
will be welcome. With two or three good
songs in her part, she will, if her powers
have not waned with the years, cheer us all
up. As a female comic singer I don’t know
her equal. That was her specialty in the
music-halls before George Edwardes engaged
her to add to the gaiety of the Strand.
“Powder Puff” : Boyd Irwin, the good-look-
ing juvenile lead, has been transferred from
the Muriel Starr co. to play another detec-
tive part—in “Kick-in.” Of the original
caste of “Within the Law” Muriel and
Boyd Irwin were the only two to last out
the run of the piece. Changes in the per-
sonnel of the company were constantly being
made, some of the parts having had as many
as six exponents; but Mary Turner and
Cassidy have had no other interpreters since
the memorable opening night in Melbourne
23 years ago. Boyd Irwin has been
eight years with Williamson, supporting such
stars as_ Tittell Brune, Katherine Grey,
Julius Knight, Tom Kingston, Titheradge,
Kolker (with Ola Jane Humphrey), Wil-
liam Desmond and Muriel Starr. He has
played Cripps to five Silver Kings—Tither-
adge, Kolker, Plimmer, Walter Bentley and
William Desmond. He won’t say which he
considers the worst.
“Harrison O.” : Excuse me if I appear to
have a neutral bee in my crush hat; but,
really, there seems to be no limit to the im-
pudence of these Yankee playmakers. “Stop
Thief,” the latest offering at the Melbourne
Royal, is not even the customary curtain-
raiser expanded into a three-acter. It is
merely a dismal conjuring turn snowed
under with patter. The scene is un-
changed, and the action (which with diffi-
culty is made to last for an hour and a half)
continuous, but the management judiciously
mitigates the agony with a couple of inter-
vals. In the first act Jack Doogan, the in-
evitable “crook” hero, steals a ring and puts
it in somebody else’s pocket; and for the
rest of the evening he keeps on stealing
things and placing them in the pockets of
various people. The fact that he does not
place everything he steals in the same per-
son's pocket is the only spice of variety
there is. These numerous confiscatory exer-
cises are interrupted by slabs of patter, sup-
plied by the conjurer and bis assistants, and
the turn is foisted on a long-suffering public
as “a farce in three acts!”
S. Aus. Eeg. Council drove a long and
strong nail into its own coffin last week,
when it insisted on leaving the money-bug
Adelaide Club out of the Bill prescribing
six o’clock closing of bars. It argued that
the club has no bar—-only cellars. At the
same time it insisted on making the Act
apply to railway stations; so the tired
traveller cannot get liquor, while the club-
man—at one solitary club —can. The Assem-
bly raged, but the mulish Fatman majority
in the Council was stubborn; and a long
conference between the Houses resulted in
the mule winning its point—and probably
losing its life. If the Assembly hadn’t given
way the early-closing referendum taken a
few months ago would have been nullified ;
and the fact that the Council was prepared
to sacrifice the public’s verdict rather than
jeopardise a few rich men’s comfort provides
the Labor party with a fine stick to beat its
enemy with.
“Backstay” : The loss of the little timber-
carrying steamer Wandra opens up an old
grievance. In 1871 the N. 8. Wales Marine
Act was passed, and exempted coasters under
100 tons from carrying mates, and those
under SO tons from the marking of loadlines.
The first scheme for wholesale murder was
abolished in 1908: the second is still law.
The Wandra, being 71 tons, is not required
to carry a Plimsoll mark, so that any theory
as to her loading being safe or unsafe when
she foundered can have nothing official to
support it. The carrying capacity of the vessel
depends on the judgment of the skipper, who
no doubt gets credit from the owners for
the amount of timber he can land in a given
time. The Wandra has made safe runs with
more than the 48.000 ft. she was carrying on
her last trip, and her skipper is a noted care-
ful man ; but he himself would be better off
if the law gave him the standard of a load-
line to work to.
. Sydney City Council gets an angular pearl
in Arthur Vernon, one of the Labor twins
who settled the business of Mayor Richards
and Alderman Griffin in Cook Ward. Ver-
non, who is secretary for the United Labor-
ers’ Union, ran as Federal candidate in the
Labor interest for Wentworth and other
places; but lie scored most notoriety when,
clad in a shirt only, he pursued: an armed
burglar through the wilds of Paddington.
The victory of “Denny” Guihen in Belmore
and John Farrell in Bligh is regarded by
stalwart Laborites as rather a doubtful
thing, since in both places the Labor man got
through in doubtful company. There is
going to be trouble in Labor circles over this.
English is an outlawed Laborite who gained
his outlawry by persisting in his candidature
for the Parliamentary seat vacant after E.
W. O’Sullivan’s death in opposition to the
P.L.L. Executive, which had declared the
League that selected him bogus, and had
endorsed another man. It would take three
years’ retirement from public life to white-
wash the offender in the eyes of the P.L.L.;
and English is too enthusiastic to take the
rest. Joynton Smith, hotel proprietor and
sport, was included in the Labor Govern-
ment’s first batch of M’s.L.C., and is credited
with Labor sympathies. The Cit'v Council
reshuffle gives (including English) 11
straight-out Labor men, as against six in
the last Council; and five others of the re-
maining 15. will vote with the Labor men
on most things. This makes the new body
practically a Labor Council.

“Fax”: More than once The Bult.etin
has suggested that a sense of proportion is
essential to any fair discussion of the treat-
ment of Germans in Australia. On the one
hand we find men who would persecute all
of them and their offspring, without con-
sideration of the length of time since the
A MERE TRANSACTION.
“Oh, you have met him, have you?”
“Well — yes. Not socially. Just on business. I married his daughter, you know."
“old man” left his Vaterland. This sort of
irate patriot draws no distinction between
the bucolic Hans who got away from Ger-
many 40 years ago, ere the world-conquest
maggot started to worry the national brain,
and the • pushful commercial Fritz who
arrived here only five or 10 years ago w T ith
the notion that he would help to smooth the
way for a German capture of the country.
To the suddenly awakened Australians, cry-
ing “Intern them all!” there is no difference
between the Hans who left his native land
behind and the Fritz who brought it with
him, so to speak, and was until August,
1914, a periodical traveller to headquarters
and an active disseminator of Berlin influ-
ence. On the other hand, the man with an
unaggressive Hun for a brother-in-law or a
cousin by marriage is apt to deprecate all
anti-German feeling at this distance from
the scene of slaughter. Hence the necessity
for a frank, impartial, official classification
of all the Germans and Austrians in Aus-
tralia.
Because we have no such classification Mel-
bourne was partly annoyed, partly shocked,
the other day by an illustrated obituary
notice of the wife of “Captain Edwards,”
said to have died at Coogee last month of a
“broken heart.” The notice stated that the
deceased matron had, after her husband was
interned, been forsaken by all former Mel-
bourne “friends” who consumed her lavish
hospitality, and that she had retired into
obscurity to nurse the woes which ultimately
were the death of her. It was a picture of
ill-merited misfortune, suggesting base in-
gratitude on the part of Melbourne sassiety.
But what is the truth? Soon after the war
outbreak “Captain Edwards,” manager of
the Continental Tyre Co., was exposed for a t
dangerous spy—a German known to Pots-*
dam as Eichengrun. Under his false name
his wife’s German nationality also was con-
cealed, though her love for the Kaiser was
much too violent to be kept bottled, and
when her calamitous potentate let slip his
dogs of war she loudly predicted the down-
fall of Britain. The lady’s acquaintances
thus found her out, and they couldn’t afford
to seem sorry for her even had she —the wife
and helpmate of a spy—deserved their com-
passion. Were they to weep for a traitorous
German woman’s loss of social position when
millions of other women in Europe were
suffering the effects of Germany’s accursed
militarism, and bemoaning the horrors of
Hunnish inhumanity and lust? Whilst Bel-
gium was wailing in her agony were the
Melbourne friends of Mrs. Eichengrun to
compassionate her over more plates of straw-
berries and cream? Her husband’s assumed
name spelt treachery. So they turned her
down the more readily because they now
knew that she was friendly under false
pretences, and had doubtless made use of
them for German in formation pin poses. _ .

formerly Commissioner of Vic. Railways,
to leave Canada on November 25 and on
arrival to “advise” the Government about
handling wheat on the elevator system. But
Jones missed his passage, and after pro-
longed silence intimated that he would be
able to catch a steamer in June this year.
He also missed that passage, whereupon Tait
cabled that there were great hopes of Jones
being outward bound in October. As he
continued not to arrive cables were next
»espatched by Peacock to Jones personally
asking him where he is and have the children
got measles. But Peacock can’t raise Jones
on the wire, though Tait has once more sent
a message, this time to remark that Jones,
having missed several more steamers, was
strenuously endeavoring to be aboard the
Makura three days before Christmas. Mean-
while a grave suspicion has taken possession
of Peacock and co. that Jones is a myth and
that Tait has been pulling their leg, and the
idea is causing Peacock to disturb his neigh-
bors with laughter in the middle of the
night.

The other day 17 doctors who had been
allowing themselves to be sweated by various
Friendly Societies in Wellington (M.L.)
rose up and said they had had enough of it.
For about 20 years doctors in the Boisterous
City have been getting 14s. per annum per
member for attending on each lodge mem-
ber, his wife, his children under 16, and
any aged dependents he might happen to
have about him. The fee represents some-
thing like a world’s record in sweating, and
the doctors have intimated that they’re not
going to patch people up any longer at a
bob and a fraction per head per annum.
They want 245. a year.. The lodges, being
mostly composed of men who belong to
unions and have had good rises lately,
naturally determined not to fatten the idle
rich. Half the doctors thereupon downed
stethoscopes on December 1 and the other
half have given a month’s notice to do it at
the end of the year.

“Peace Society President”: While the
blue metal is still in the air I want to say
that it is no use fining these fellows 40s. and
costs. The “natural leaders” one reads so
-many eulogies of in war literature have to
discover themselves and be discovered some-
how ; and when the discovery is made in
a window-smashing riot it seems to be the
straight tip to the military people that the
young man is being kept in the wrong place.
If the ardent Napoleon had been fined in a
police court alongside casual drunks every
time he smashed something in Europe, at
least one of the world’s conquerors might
have given up the history-making job in dis-
gust and gone into vaudeville or a corner
grocery store.
The S. Aus. Supreme Court has given
another of its common-sense judgments. On
a claim for breach of contract a handsome
£3OO was allowed ; yet the claimants, though
so far successful, were not allowed any costs,
on the ground that the £lOOO they had
claimed was far too much, and that a reason-
able demand—for anything up to £5O0 —
could have been tried in the much-less-expen-
sive Local Court. By the way, the said
Local Court discourages the bringing of
trivial actions by allowing no costs at all on
any judgment under £5.
One of the grimmest of all under-water
tragedies was very nearly paralleled at Glen-
elg (S.A.) the other day. A diver, feeling his
way in turbid water along a breakwater now
being made there, put his fingers in a crack
in the caisson, which suddenly shifted a
trifle and trapped his hand. Then his luck
suddenly turned ; another heavy swell moved
the caisson again, and released him with
nothing worse than crushed fingers and a
bad scare. In the American case of the
kind, where a diver in a reservoir lake got
one leg jambed into the outlet pipe, he
stayed there a whole day till he died, with a
frantic comrade going down at intervals to
pay him unavailing visits.

“Pick” discusses another of these weary
time- and money-wasting tramps : —•
The ostensible object of a recruiting march being
to skim populated centres of war eligibles, the syllabus
of a 229-miles tramp, billed to start from Delegate
(N.S.W.) on January 6 and reach Goulburn on the
29th, discloses few points that make the game worth
the leather. On the long road only four townships—-
Bombala, Cooma, Queanbevan and Bungendore—will
be traversed. Each has had its Recruiting Associa-
tion working for months and has more or less regu-
larly forwarded volunteers to the camps. Bivouacs
at four small villages are also arranged for —at Craigie,
Bibbenluke, Nimmitabel and Tarago. These, too,
have been systematically recruited from the larger
centres. A few railway sidings and sheep stations
are likewise halting places, but at none of these will
the assembled multitude consist of more than a
fettler or two, or a boundary-rider and his dog. On
at least 11 days of the march scarcely a wayside hut
will be seen. Punching through the drifting sands
of the Billilingra desert will be on the programme
for the 18th day. Meanwhile the Cooma trains will
flit alongside, and the sum of money each centre
en route is expected to raise in aid of the funds
would pay the fares of probably every man in the
company.
And now it transpires that, while the men
are wasting valuable days plodding through
the sand and getting no military training
whatever, this bleeding country is parting-
up to them the full military pay. The humili-
ation of these circus tricks to raise an army
is surely bad enough without paying hard-
borrowed money for the shame.

Last week the spinsters of the Australian
Peace Alliance met in the Masonic Hall at
Melbourne and learnt a song to help them on
their way to victory. It was a characteristic
war-product of the U.S.A., and the title was
“I Didn’t liaise My Boy to Be a Soldier."’
Cecilia John, who leads the choir at the
Congregational Church in Collins-street,
showed how the thing went; and the singly-
blessed assemblage humorlessly sang and
howled and piped the refrain over and over
again until it went smoothly. The women-
folk who had “raised boys,” of course, were
not there to say anything about their atti-
tude. Mostly they were sitting at home,
writing to their youngest lad at the Front, or
knitting a sock for him, or doing without
their supper to send him some little luxury.
The Peace Alliance, however, seemed to
notice nothing amusing about its position,
and kept on rocking its empty cradle and
waving its imaginary marriage-lines at inter-
vals throughout the evening.
The danger of walking on the edge of the
bulwarks when there is an unfriendly person
lurking in the neighborhood with a marlin-
spike will probably now appeal to the Mer-
chant Service Guild. That body had a set
of rules which bound its members to refuse
to accept anything below a certain standard
of wages and conditions, or to work at all
under certain circumstances, and as the
N. S. Wales law says that such matters are
the concern of the law, and not enforceable
by a union itself, the rules could not be
registered. But, as some rules had to be
filed, the Guild had a nice tame set for regis-
tration purposes. Now, this Guild has a
rival organisation, the Masters and Engin-
eers, the former covering, roughly, the offi-
cers of deep-sea shipping, and the other the
coast, harbor and river service. The line
between the two being very nicely drawn,
there is naturally a good deal of friction
between them, especially as the Guild car-
ries a fair cargo of lofty disdain. So the
body that is just plain Association rushed in
with information about the Guild’s double
practices; and a few days ago the Guild’s
registration was cancelled in the State
Court. It still retains its Federal regis-
tration, of course, but the State registration
was a useful thing which it will not like to
see adrift.
A MAN OF LITTLE FAITH.
HIS HONOR : “How do you plead?”
COUNSEL FOR ACCUSED (sotto voce): “Say,
'Not guilty, your Honor,’ and ‘I reserve
my defence.’”
ACCUSED “(facetiously): “Not guilty, your
Honor —and observe my defence!”
STANDING FORTH.
MRS. GREEN: “There, do you like my dress,
dear? Do you think it will stand out ?”
MR. GREEN: “At any rate, you will.”
“Kukukuku”: The Christmas note is
sounded early in Papua. It; was at the end
of October that I went sailing round an
island off the long tail of New Guinea, and
stopped at a small village on the coast.
There were only four houses in it, oddly
painted on the gable with large square eyes
looking watchfully out to sea, and very few
natives. I went up to one of the houses,
climbed the ladder, and was instantly driven
back by a fierce charge of dogs—small dogs,
biggish dogs, puppies; white dogs, reddish
dogs, yellow dogs; all young or youngish,
dogs, yellow dogs; all
young or youngish, all
fierce, and all remark-
ably fat. There were
.one. or two women
living in the house,
evidently in charge of
the dogs. I crossed
the village square, and
tried another ladder
and another door. The
result was the same,
except for the sudden
and violent exit of
two or three youngish
and fattish cats, which
seemed to he living on
terms of peace and
harmony with the
dogs, but to object to
strange humans. Here
also there were the
guardian women, nurs-
ing the puppies and
tending the bigger
dogs. Another house
gave the same reaction
of dog. In fact, the
village Avas a dog vil-
lage, with just a few
human beings looking
after the fat and pam-
pered brutes. I asked
my boat’s crew if the
place was a dog-breed-
ing establishment for
the whole island, and
this is what they told
me: “Boy he no
keepem dog along
another boy. He
keepem along himself
along Clistmas ; by-’n’-
by Clistmas comine,
then dog, then pusi,
he plenty good kai-kai
—my word !” And they smacked their lips.
After this, who shall say that the Papuan
has gained nothing by the Christian religion?

One Ryan, of a township in the Ballarat
district, got into trouble for hitting a neigh-
bor with a brick. “This is the third Irish-
man in three months we have had to sen-
tence for using a brick,” said the chairman
of the Bench. The neat little, sweet little
sham rock of Ireland.
“Tamumu”: Panama
Bay, at the Pacific end
of the Panama Canal,
looks just now (October
35) as if it was a picnic
ground for half the ship-
ping in the Pacific. The
canal became blocked
about the middle of Sep-
tember owing to land-
slides at the Culebra
Out. Ship after ship thus
piled up in the bay, until
by October 10 there were
40 steamers at anchor.
Things are much the
same at Colon, the Atlan-
tic end. The canal
authorities had made a
statement to the effect
that they hoped to have
the canal open for traffic
by November 1, and were
working night and day
with steam shovels and
dredgers, when, on the
night of October 11, half
a hill slipped into the
cut, making it possible
to walk dryshod again
from North to South
America. The trouble
seems to be that the hills
surrounding the cut rest
on a foundation of gravel,
and if anything happens
to disturb this bed the
knob simply subsides
gracefully into the canal.
Present indications are
that the ditch will not be
open for traffic this
year; in fact, it is not likely to be
a dependable proposition until the small
hills surrounding it are removed alto-
gether. Meantime steamers from Australia,
Maoriland, South America and the Western
States, bound for the Eastern States and
the U.K., will have to take the long trail
via Magellan Straits. But as they all want
bunker coal, and as they can’t all get it at
once, Panama Bay is likely to have a large
maritime population for some time.

This from someone in Turkey who has
neither an axe to grind nor stinking fish to
cry:—
There’s no need to enlarge, I suppose, on the
absence of grumbling among the chaps out here.
But there is one thing that galls. It is becoming a
scandal to see youngsters in their teens, who have
only at this stage realised that it is their duty to
leave Australia, stuck into positions over veterans who
since the first landing have really had the oppor-
tunity to learn The Game. The practice has become
so general that a few of the old ’uns have complained,
with just a touch of bitterness, that had they stayed
at home a while longer and put off doing their duty
they would now be much better off. It does not
seem a square deal. By the way, one of our greatest
sources of joy is to read in print the letters sent
from us ’eroes to our mothers and sweethearts. The
gladness lasts sometimes for weeks while the tell-tale
paper travels up and down the trenches. You’ll soon
find, I think, that letters from these parts will shed
the heroics and talk the unvarnished.
* * * *
“481” : Some of us brought over our stock-
whips from Australia as mementoes of the
saltbush and the mulga. But we have had only
one chance to use them. That came about
this way. The Arabs who haunted our lines
were the slickest thieves in the world. They
made night stable-picket a nightmare.
Three men were on duty together, and when,
as often happened, a horse got loose, all
three would be required to
restore order. Then was
the thieves’ chance to lift
feed, nosebags, horse rugs of
anything else from the other
end of the lines. Head-
quarters issued a complaint
that far too much feed, etc.,
was requisitioned, and
greater care must be taken
to prevent waste and theft.
The men smarted under this
order, and at last a plan
was formed to teach a lesson
and adorn a tale. At three
o’clock next morning six
mounted troopers were drawn
up behind the mess-room,
On the roof was posted a
look-out. Suddenly our sen-
tinel gave a word. “Here
they are! Ready? Go!”
Away went the Arabs, and
after them went the riders,
and in a few seconds yells
and shrieks indicated that
those whips were doing good
work across the desert of
Araby. Every man was awarded 14 days’
C. 8., but as our regimental horse-lines were
never troubled again, no one minded.
* * * *
“Veldt” : Prime Minister Hughes can find
no military reason why German schools in
Australia should be shut. For my part I
can find no reason why they should be kept
open , and if the Commonwealth continues to
sanction a system wherby the offspring of
Bermans are taught German literature, his-
toij and Rultur by German pedagogues in
the German tongue—well, it will deserve
German annexation. Loyalty is mainly a
matter of language and literature, as every
Dutchman knows. National feeling goes
with the national turn of the tongue. When
a community of French Huguenots was estab-
lished in South Africa centuries ago, the
dominant Dutchmen took no risk of becoming
politically infected by a foreign element. As
soon as they learned a little of the ruling
language the French immigrants were for-
bidden to speak their own, even in their
homes. _ And their descendants became en-
thusiastically Boer, even as the descendants
of English settlers in Ireland became per-
fervid nationalists by mere adoption of an
Irish accent. Joubert, Delarey and other
notable Boers of French extraction are all
descended from Huguenots whose native
language was promptly eradicated. They
were allowed to keep only their ancestral
names, which, by the way, was more than
the Germans permitted to the Jews who
settled in their midst.
* * * *
“Renidrag”: The cheerful casualness of
Billjim again. The front mud-guard of an
Adelaide motor-’bus bumped him heavily in
that part which has never been shown to
the Turks. He fell, but, quickly recovering
the perpendicular, sprang at attention,
saluted and “Pass motor, all’s well!” he
said.
A CIRCUMSTANCE BEYOND

"Yes, Tommy, I did.”

THE BOOZER’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The agitation for the closing of all hotel bars fit
nine o’clock still continues.
I cannot drink the old drinks now;
My liver’s gone to pot;
So I have sworn a watery vow,
Although I’d rather not;
The water-waggon bears me on
While noble liquor flows ;
I’ve naught to show for good times gone,
Unless it is my nose!
I cannot drink the old drinks now,
Or rage with other men
Who come to me and tell me how
They still close up at ten ;
The doctor warned me long ago
That I had drunk all mine,
So let the wowsers flap and crow,
And shut them up at nine!
I cannot drink the old drinks now,
And, Lord! it makes me mad
When modern boozers reel and row,
Because of drinks they’ve had !
They sight my nose and call me “Mate!”
But from their arms I fly ;
The drinks I cannot have I hate i
A secret .wowser I!

Robert Scott Inglis, just dead at Rich-
mond (Vic.); settled there soon after land-
ing in Melbourne over GO j'ears ago, ■ and
later on represented the district in the Leg.
Assembly, his colleague being Joe Bosisto,
the man who persuaded Australia that
eucalyptus oil was virtuous. In addition to
running a business in Little Collins-street,
Robert once found time to be champion
bowler of the State, and, with his brother,
a parson, to found the Richmond Presby-
terian Church. He survived the strain until
lie was 82.
G. W. Smith’s term of office as Commis-
sioner of the Tas. is to be extended,
for a year, so that Parliament can see next
session whether it wants to amend the basis
of his appointment before he, or someone
else, is appointed for another four years.
The fly in the ointment is that the railway
employees want to get away from the one-
man rule by having a right of appeal to the
1 übhe Service Board. As they have a whole
lot of votes Ministers and members have to
take_ some notice of them, while the Com-
missioner refuses to have any Public Ser-
vice Board lingers in the pie that' he is
made personally responsible for.

LEE PER,
Warden of

University.
Alf Ozanne, M.H.R, for Corio (Vic.), has
lost his brother Eugene at Gallipoli. A big
six-footer, with a wife and three sons,
Eugene Ozanne was in the Westralian Gar-
rison Artillery when the tocsin sounded,
joined the early birds a few days after the
Germans began to hammer Liege, and was
killed in action 15 months later —about the
middle of November. He took part in the
first gory doings on Beach Z, and thereafter
fought in the trenches until his time came.
W. W. Davis, wlio was one of the
Bourke group away back in the years when
the Labor party pushed into the N.S.W.
Assembly, was heard of the other clay.
Guted at last from polities he got a job
from the Lands Department as G.l*. in-
spector, and at 75 he is still scurrying
around, ostensibly to find out why Bill
Mulga hasn’t put up the six-wire fence the
Land Board prescribed nine years ago, really
to find an excuse why the lease shouldn’t be
forfeited. Somebody told the Department
that “Baldy” was too old for the job, and
on a rumor that he was to be retired vari-
ous presentations were made. But it has
since been discovered that the one-time col-
league of Nick Willis never could be too
old.
HORRORS OF WAR.
HE: “You go in swimming a lot. Health ?”
SHE : “No. Economising. Bad’s cut the
dress allowance.”
Big John Forrest had a jubilee last Satur-
day—so years ago he entered the Westralian
civil service. He lias been continuously in
Parliament 33 years, and for over 25 years
of that time lias been a Minister. He has
held office in five Federal Ministries, and
would have been leader of the Opposition
now but for the wowsers supporting Joe
Cook.
Seventy this month, William B'urford, of
Adelaide, chairman of the soap and candle
co. bearing the family name. Candles run
in the Burford family. The grandfather
manufactured them in London, and in 3840
the father taught infant S. Aus. how to do
it instead of throwing away its fat and im-
porting the manufactured article from
Hobart.
An agricultural organ in Melbourne has
been privileged to look upon a melon grown
at Emerald which “bears an amazing resem-
blance to George Reid. Even the monocle
is not lacking.” Admirers in London are
subscribing to secure a sculptured bust of
our wry Commissioner. Why not send them
the melon?
William Henry Tunics, civil servant for 43
years, died at Parramatta recently, aged (il.
lie had lived all his life in the old town.
The original Tunks came out as a marine in
the First Fleet, and elected to remain a
colonist when the corps was relieved by the
N. S. Wales Corps, or Rum Regiment. In
later time a huge native “Bill” Tunks
married Mrs. McKone, of the Curriers’ Arms
Inn, entered Parliament for St. Leonards
(1564), and stuck to the seat for a decade.
He was mayor of the borough for 18 success-
ive years, and a fountain, which never has
any water, is standing in his honor in St.
Leonards Park. “Bill” was a cricketer whose
strength of wrist was prodigious. But he
merely swiped, and in the first “inter-
colonial” match, played in March, 1856, at
Melbourne, he got only one in the first
innings and a “duck” in the second. N. S.
Wales scored a win by two wickets and one
run, by the way.
Lord Dick Nevill’s father, the Marquis of
Abergavenny, died last week at the early age
of 89. He was the first marquis hi the
family, though an alleged ancestor had the
title of Baron Bergavenny as far back as
A.D. 1392. . A pleasant, nice-spoken gent, was
the Marquis, who outlived so many of his con-
temporaries. His possessions included the
land where Lewes racecourse was established
some 50-years ago, and his eldest son was
titled Earl of Lewes.
Died last week, at Wellington (M.L.),
Nicholas Reid, once a partner in the firm of
W. and G. Turnbull and Co., at that time
running one of the biggest shipping and mer-
cantile businesses thereabouts, whose service
lie entered as a storeman somewhere about
the beginning of things. He was a tall,
spare, sombre Scot, and for many years had
a finger in the management of the local
Harbor Board, the Gear Meat Co. and
affairs of that kind, but towards the end had
accumulated more ill-health than anything
else. One of his sons, for his part, accumu-
lated a wife decorated with half a million or
so—the young widow of T. G. McCarthy, the
octogenarian brewer, who three or four years
ago left a ton of money behind him and a
generous will.
That Earl of Glasgow who
passed on the title last week at
82 was the central figure in a
constitutional controversy a
quarter of a century ago, and
retired from it with more
knowledge than he started with.
He was Governor of Maori!and
when the old Tory party was
wiped out by Ballance, and
when asked to sign the war-
rants calling certain nominees
of the Liberals to the Leg.
Council, as a sort of counter-
blast to the crowd of squatters,
rushed in at the last moment by
Atkinson, he balked at the job.
Ballance protested to “Downing-
street and Glasgow was curtly
informed that his business was
to take the advice of Ministers
and put his' own opinions in
cold storage. He was a tall,
white-whiskered party in those
days, of simple habit and
manners, who liked making
speeches of great brevity. Most
of his life had been spent in
the navy in which he had a
long and honorable record.
The eldest son, Viscount Kel-
burne, who followed dad afloat,
was lately decorated for distin-
guished service. A branch of
the _ family still in
Maori lan (I—the Boyles, of Canterbury. The
old man's right name Avas Davy Boyle, and
his father’s name was Pat.
“Y.Z.”: go Web Gilbert has been
commissioned to “do” George Reid in marble.
Web, the most successful Australian artist
in stone since Mackennal, was till a couple of
years ago cook with Parer Bros., Melbourne,
and in the first place did decorative subjects
in lard and mutton-fat for the restaurant
show-window. This experience perhaps
makes George a congenial subject. But
Gilbert no doubt remembers Rodin’s reply
when asked to carve a porky municipal digni-
tary. “Carve him —IV” said the sculptor,
looking his subject over. “All right. But
first send for the butcher!”
George Renfrey, of Mount Gambier (S.A.),
has had an experience to make the
head swell. After being mayor for
three years- and president of nearly every-
thing local, he shifted to St. Ivilda (Vie.).
He had only three years there, but for two
of them lie was a councillor. Now health
reasons have taken him back to Mt. Gam-
bier, which turned out Avith a band and
swore him in as mayor the same day.
Monsignor Brodie, of Parnell, Auckland,
avlio succeeds Bishop Grimes at Christ-
church, is a prelate with ia
punch. Born in the Auckland
district 43 years ago, he was
educated at Manly (Sydney),
the head of the place then being
Bishop Verdon, now in Dunedin.
He was ordained about 18 years
ago, and for his work at Waihi
was made Archdeacon. In days
when he was too young to bisli
he was a smart Rugby player,
and is still an honorary member
of the Auckland Referees’ Asso-
ciation. His main job in
Christchurch will be to finish
getting his predecessor’s enormous cathedral
paid for.
Died in Taree (N.S.W.) hospital last
week Henry Eastaway, one of the old shell-
backs in the coastal trade. In youth lie
sailed on almost every sea, and then became
harbormaster at his native town of Younal,
Ireland. But when his wife died the old
life claimed him again, so he pulled on his
oilskins and went —this time on the P. and
0. liner Carthage. He left her at Sydney
and joined the Rosedale, then running to
the North Coast under the Nipper and See
management. That was 30 years back
before the N.C.S.N, Co. swallowed the
opposition. Eastaway Went on serving as a
deck officer on various ships of that co.’s
fleet until 12 years ago, when he settled
down to farming at Taree. He had held a
master mariner’s ticket from his 20th birth-
day, and the date of that was 1862.
That good Australian, N. C. Dockyer, hav-
ing six: months’ leave from the Inter-State
Commission, feels that he may be able to do
a bit for liis country at last; so, putting
his services at the disposal of the Defence
BEEBY, of the N.S.W. Arbitration Court.
Department, he has been turned on to the
control of military canteens. Simultaneously
Fred Johns, leader of the official Hansard
staff in S. Aus., offered his services during
the long Parliamentary recess—“for hospital
or other duties in Egypt or elsewhere.” The
Department showed its amazing incapacity
for handling men by replying that “there is
no position in which his services could be
utilised.”
Hughes’s friend, “Bob” Anderson, has
been made a colonel, and is to go to Egypt
as Deputy-Quartermaster General with the
towering Irving. Irving is to take charge of
the men at the base, and Anderson is to take
charge of the stores. It is one of R. -McC.
Anderson’s qualifications for the big job that
lie doesn’t know a platoon from a mess-tin,
having been too busy learning the tricks of
commerce and finance to give any attention
to those of the parade ground. The son of a
police-inspector with a backbone, he spent his
early working years with the Bank of New
Zealand; then stepped over to the Town
Hall, where he reorganised the staff; next
was collared by Allen Taylor as just the
man he.wanted for a partner, and helped to
quickly build up one of the biggest timber
businesses in Australia. Cutting the Allen
Taylor connection a year or so ago he has
since been busy telling various people how
they could better organise their offices. He lias
been through the Post Office and the Defence
Department,, and was lately over at Auck-
land on a similar job for the City Council.
A frequent complaint against him is that he
suffers from an excess of imagination. But
it would be a poor organiser who didn’t have
imagination to direct his more mathematical
faculties.
A FESTIVE PARTY IN BERLIN.
Amsterdam newspapers state that the German
General Staff has authorised the. sale of chemical
foods -in large quantities. Companies are advertising
artificial butter and omelettes and chemical honey
and eggs.— Cable.
Gardiner, the M.L.A. who is now worry-
ing Holman, is one of the two schoolmasters
about whose “victimisation” a special fuss
was niade during Wade’s Premiership. The
Education Department had issued an edict
against its officers engaging in political mat-
ters; and as these teachers had been identi-
fied with P.L.L. activity, they were trans-
ferred to other districts. The occurrence
made good party ammunition ; and the subse-
quent agitation put both men into Parlia-
ment. Dunn, M.L.A., was the other.
COURAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Coin-age,” he said ; and speaking courage fell.
The thunderous rout of war went rolling past.
The flying death from shot and bursting shell
Reddened the earth with murder grim and vast;
And he who talked of courage writhed in pain,
Ilis hot blood poured upon the earth in vain.
The foe pressed on. The thin lines, lightning seamed,
Reeled in the tumult, spent in hope and breath;
Around them the red tempest seethed and streamed
O’er blackened pits of ruin choked with death.
“Courage,” he said, and speaking courage died,
11 hile fear laid strangle-hold upon his pride.
Tor him the world went black in strange eclipse;
The cold and quiet claimed him for their own.
A smile, set hard upon his tight-pressed lips,
Remained when that large storm had overblown.
“Courage,” it said ; and something we could see
On that dead face flamed us to victory.

The year’s profit wouldn’t suggest that the
nation was fighting the most desperate war
of its long history, and that on top of the
war had fallen a serious drought. Com-
pared with the conditions of the past those
of to-day are so different that former ex-
perience goes for hardly anything at all.
Partly because the world’s credit system
has been so developed, partly because the
outcome of this war is so tremendously seri-
ous, we are scarcely thinking of the cost.
We are spending thousands of millions ; yet
nobody is being asked for any contribution
worth mentioning. On the contrary, instead
of taking a man’s money from him and giv-
ing him nothing but glory in return, the
nation says “Here, we’ll give you more in-
terest for it than you ever got before”—
and it is doing so. Further, because
almost the last thing we want anyone to
think about is the cost, the authorities have
got into the way of paying almost any old
price for anything. The nation is therefore
in extreme danger of having what may be
called its money-sense quite destroyed. Rot-
ten old sailers are bucketing round the Horn
from U.S.A. and getting 50s. or 60s. per ton
for freight. And while the capitalist goes in
for that brand of cent, per cent, money-
making, and other people pay it, the laborer
coolly drops in a demand for a rise that would
mean an increased wages bill of over a mil-
lion on a State railway and tramway ser-
vice which was already showing a loss.
Even the borrowed money that is spent in
large lumps on our old friend “Permanent
and Reproductive Works” demoralises a
community by creating a bogus prosperity.
But the present demoralisation is much worse
because, as remarked before, the bulk of the
money is spent without any serious deter-
mination to get good value according to
ordinary standards. And if the present
drunk is worse the headache in the morning
is going to be worse, too. The money spent
on the “permanent and reproductive” work
geuerally brings in some interest. This
expenditure brings in none 'whatever. On
the contrary, it produces a harvest of annual
debt in the shape of war pensions, etc.
Present conditions, therefore, give an entirely
fictitious idea of what the future will be;
and the concern that overlooks this, or the
investor who overlooks it, is making trouble
for home consumption. (Pleasant Christ-
mas sermon this, isn’t it?)
How is the trouble going to affect Aus-
tralia? Well, first, we must remember that
the present conditions are not normal. So
if nothing bad happened to Australia —that
is to say, if quite normal conditions followed
the war —there would still be a slump. But
after the war, instead of spending borrowed
millions in a hang-the-expense style, we
shall have to pay, pay, pay. There is
interest and sinking fund to be found, and
every penny of it to come out of taxation,
because none of the debt ■is reproductive.
To some extent, so far as Ihe debt is local,
this means the transference of money from
one pocket to another. But foreign bor-
rowings mean that we shall have to annually
ship away perhaps an extra couple of mil-
lions’ worth of produce and get not a farthing
for it, and at the same time produce another
million’s worth to pay for the maintenance
of non-producing pensioners. A further
awkward feature is that, except as to a few
lines, the people to whom we sell most of
our exports will not be in a position to pay
even normal prices for them. It is all quite
unavoidable. And the longer the war lasts
(which is to say. the slower the recruiting
proceeds), the worse will the position be
by-and-bye.
All this doesn’t affect Dalgety’s more than
it affects the rest of the community. It
explains, however, why, in the face of war
and drought. Dalgety’s can for the 12 months
show a profit equal to that of previous years.
The chances are it has put something sub-
stantial up its sleeve as well. It should
have done so, anyhow. But presently its
valuable commission business must suffer in
some lines. But not in all: for even on the
staples we shall send away to pay old debt,
and for which we shall be getting nothing in
return —even on that the commission
agents will get tlicir little bit. For-
tunately the co. has resisted the tempta-
tion to rush up dividends during the
period of recent prosperity, real and
artificial; hence its magnificent reserves.
Certainly it ought to have large reserves,
because its debts are heavy. This groups
the liabilities and assets :

But while the co. owes a good deal of money,
no less than £2,203,140 of it (or nearly half
the total on all accounts) is in perpetual
stock; and that is a great safeguard in a
business so largely dependent on the rather
erratic rural industries of Australia. And
to have that money mostly at 4 p.c. is fine
also from a profit-making point of view in
the present era of dear money—an era that
is likely to last some years after the guns are
silent again.

There is a good deal of vagueness about that
fable; but for that you can blame Dunedin
and not George-street North. The Union
management is mostly Scotch, and the
Scotch tendency is not towards financial
ostentation. Consequently every little while
you are liable to find out that the Union is
better off than you thought it was. A
couple of years or so back it transferred a
cool £1,000,000 of reserves to capital, mak-
ing the latter £2.000.000, and when the
operation was all over it had only about
£300,000 less of visible reserves, than at the
date of the last previous balance-sheet.
Allowing for _ the profit made during the
period for which no accounts are available,
it thus seems most probable that the co. was
about £600,000 better oil' than it said it
was on September, 1912.
.The idea at the back of the Caledonian
mind is that if it owned up to having sax-
pence somebody might ask it; for the money,
and what a terrible. thing it would be if it
gave tuppence of .it away and presently
found out that it really hadn’t owned
the saxpence, after all! The Union aims
at averting that disaster by making abso-
lutely sure of owming the saxpence before
confessing to it. Hence this entry in the
current accounts: “Reserve for liabilities not
yet adjusted, including provision for allow-
ances on adjustment of contracts, Imperial,
Commonwealth . and Dominion taxes, and
extra depreciation on steamers in Govern-
ment service, £209,227.” How much of that
the co. is going to hang on to this paper
of course doesn’t know. The management
evidently hopes that it will be quite a lot,
otherwise. it would simply have written the
amount right off. Whatever it hangs on to
will be profit for the year in addition to the
£182.850 shown in the table. That profit,
by the way, includes additions made to the
insurance fund, but not those made to the
depreciation and renewals funds. As usual
the revenue put by to pay for replacements
and repairs isn’t mentioned. It will be
noted, however, that in the years gone by
the amounts laid by were so excessive that
they formed a hidden reserve which was
presently transferred to capital. It is not
likely that the old policy lias been reversed.
Another view of the co.’s year may be
got from these figures:—
Liabilities.

Freeholds, etc. .. .. .. 177,566 179,635
Liquid assets 736,702 1,006,183
The co. doesn’t owe quite as much as it did
12 months ago : and it certainly hasn’t re-
duced its fleet. Yet, after paying dividends and
interest, it has a shade more in city property
and about £270,000 more in cash balances,
sundry debtors and investments in securities.
Against that there may be accruing taxation
which hasn’t been provided for and other
contingencies which even this most experi-
enced directorate can’t foresee and specifi-
cally provide for. It is fairly certain, how-
ever, that much of that £270,000 is in the
co.’s hands for keeps.

“Bill o’ Costs” : I get really annoyed with
The Bulletin. Here it is again, in the
Wild Cat Department (9/12/T5), giving
possible testators the tip that “when the
family lawyer and the good old friend-of-
the-family are pushed out of the business [of
trusteeship] there will be plenty of room
for the Trustee Companies.” It is very
hard, considering the trouble it takes our
profession sometimes to push into the busi-
ness. The friend-of-the-family I am not
much concerned about, though he is usually
a good asset to us in the long run. but he
doesn’t have to work for his appointment, in
the first place. Take the ease of Mr. Grabbit
(of Knipp and Grabbit), for whom I used
to clerk. When he had a will-making client
in hand, of course the question of trusteeship
would arise, and in about two cases out of
three the client hadn’t settled it; he some-
how expected the lawyer to do that for him,
and the latter usually did —small blame to
him. Mr. Grabbit was at his top in this
speciality. “Of course, my dear sir,” he
would say, “a member of your family, by
all means; your wife, as a sort of compli-
ment, and perhaps an old friend of the fam-
ily-very proper. But might I suggest the
advisability of adding an executor with busi-
ness knowledge, and, if possible, professional
knowledge of the business of managing
trusts? It won’t cost you any more.” (It
always did, but that’s by the way.) “With a
—er —professional man, as it were, at their
elbow, your other executors would feel,” etc.,
etc. If the client hadn’t bitten by this time
lie would add jocularly: “Mr. Knipp (my
partner, you know) has his hands so full of
trusteeships that he was threatening the
other day to refuse any more. Only his
joke, of course, because I always give him
a hand. _ Oh, well, I don’t personally take
trusteeships, except in very special cases;
though I should like to oblige you. Thanks
for the compliment, all the same. Suppose
we go and have lunch at my club and talk
it over.” There wasn’t anything to talk
over, if the client was safely on the line, but
sometimes he wasn’t.
All this, you see. involves special trouble,
and often there is disappointment and bitter-
ness in store. Let this draw tears from your
callous eyes. Old Potts, the rich suburban
house-owner, made a practice of taking his
business, in turn, to half the lawyers in
town. One day he got Mr. Grabbit lo draft
a will for him. This was sent to the old
hunks with a tentative appointment of “one
of our firm” as executor embodied. About
a week after, Potts came in with the will
in a sealed envelope. We understood quite
well that he had copied the draft himself
and executed it: on his own, to save costs.
Mr. Grabbit mildly reprobated this, but could
not afford to give offence. “.Tust so, Mr.
Potts, we’ll keep it in our safe until the
time arrives—may it be long! ha! ha! Then
my best services will be at the disposal,” etc.
About once a year for six years old Potts
used to call to be assured that the will was
safely stored. That was the full extent of
his patronage of the firm. Mr. Grabbit used
to take the package out and fairly lick liis
lips over the prospect of the crop of leases,
surrenders, mortgages, transfers, commis-
sions and what-not to be scraped off the
carcase in due time. When the funeral did
happen, Mr. Grabbit, an expensive wreath,
and half our stall: supported the corpse.
There were about six other lawyers there
explaining confidentially to one another that,
as solicitor for the deceased, they thought it
their duty to be there. Afterwards, Mr.
Grabbit broke the seal and read the will to
the usual family conclave, and discovered
that the miserable old fraud had appointed
a trustee company as executor and nomi-
nated another solicitor to prove the will, etc.
They say Mr. Grabbit went home by way
of the cemetery and removed his wreatli.
At any rate, some of the “floral tributes”
were found to be badly scorched. And yet
you want to push us out of the business.
Shame!

It was a good service 'Captain Miles did Aus-
tralia when, travelling in Siam, he nosed out
Tongkah Harbor, and got his jam-making
mends of Tasmania to form the original
IXL Syndicate—the name taken from the
label on Henry Jones’s prime raspberry tins.
On the Tongkah’s heels followed the Com-
pound, and after that a whole regiment of
Siamese and F.M.S. tin-dredging cos. Tong-
kah alone has already paid £247,500 in divi-
dends, and there is no telling how much more
is in hiding in the shallow harbor bottom. Tt is
almost certain that the richest part has been
dredged: yet it is quite possible that 'there
are nice patches still ahead. No. 0 dredge,
started daring the past year, was put to work
seaward from the outermost point yet
touched by the other machines, and it aver-
aged .671 b. tin in September and .02 for the
whole 10 months. No. 5 dredge, also work-
ing well out, has got as much as 1.211 b.
The history of the recoveries for the whole
proposition for six .years has been as fol-
lows :—-

But the chances are that the co. will have
to be satisfied with something less than
.901 b. iu future. No. 3, which brought up
the past year’s average, has been on an area
close in. and there isn’t much more of that
patch left. However, the poorest ground
treated by any dredge (No. 6) averaged a
shade over 64d. ; and working costs there
were a shade under old., which gave a work-
ing profit of £8687 for the 10 months, equal
to £10,424 for 12 months :so with a decent
tin market there seems to lie still a good
store of corn in Egypt. The co. has now
paid off its debentures and has got out of
debt to the Siamese Government. This lia-
bility at the start amounted to £35,000, the
sum accepted in lien of certain harbor work
which the co. originally agreed to carry out.
Besides thus clearing itself and paying for
all its dredges, the co. has put £40,000 in its
stocking. But, if things go all right, this
will no doubt be eaten up by construction,
which before long may be needed to replace
or renew Nos. 2 and 3. No. 1 sank over
12 months ago, and has been dismantled.
Presumably to give the directors a line as to
what building programme is warranted a
good deal of boring has been carried out
lately; but the manager is perversely silent
as to results.

This co. holds 653 acres of rubber lands in
the Federated Malay States. Five and a
half years ago, when it was formed, rubber
was booming, and £12,000 in paid-up shares
didn’t seem too much to give for ISO acres
of plantation and a few more acres ready
cleared. The boom didn’t last long, however ;
from half a sovereign the price steadily
sagged to the neighborhood of half a crown.
The dry rubber harvested last year by this
co. averaged 2s. 2.36 and. per lb., and there
doesn’t seem to be any reason to expect that
future demand will outpace supply and force
the price up. This co. says it can do all
right at present quotations. All-in charges
were last year about Is. lid. and for the
current year, on an output of SO,OOO as
against last year’s 50,0001 b., they are reck-
oned to be just a shade over Is. That would
give a profit of nearly £4OOO less adminis-
tration and depreciation, which should be
covered by, say, £I4OO.
Of the 653 acres in the estate 567 acres
are now planted, but 147 acres are imma-
ture, though the bulk of this area should be
ready to tap in a couple of years. The co.
seems thus to definitely have its nose around
the. corner. Development work is of course
easing off now, and as the trees spread the
cost of keeping the plantation free from
jungle growth will diminish. Three other
points have to be considered: (1) the labor
question, (2) the rubber market, (3.) the
possibilities of war troubles affecting the
district. As to labor the co. has been put-
ting more Chinese on the pay-sheet, and has
now 110 of them, with 84 Hindoos and
Malays. The manager finds the Chinese “a
very satisfactory labor force, and their num-
bers are very easily added to.” As to the
market, nothing can of course be said defi-
nitely, but the prospects seem quite satis-
factory. There was once a lot of talk about
synthetic rubber; but the substitute to com-
pete with an article at 2s. isn’t the same
proposition as one to compete with a half-
sovereign article. As to No. 3, conditions
are very unsettled in the F.M.S.. but more
than that nothing may be said. Considering
that the co. has almost got to the end of its
long development campaign and has only
just started harvesting on a fairly big scale,
the. finances are very satisfactory—thanks •
mainly to an issue of 5000 shares, some of
them at a premium, during 1914. The
capital on June 30 was £28.249, in 30.000
£1 shares, all of them except 3502 fully paid.
Liabilities on .Tune 30 were a little over
£4OOO, and liquid assets amounted to nearly
£3OOO.

The position is slowly improving. Twelve
months ago the liabilities were £22.190; they
are now £23,375. Meantime the assets other
than stock, plant and leasehold premises
have gone from £18.496 to £22,738. Stock,
certainly, is in the balance-sheet at about
£IBOO less; but it is not clear whether this
was written down or converted into cash.
Anyway, there is evidence apart from the
Profit and Loss account that the co. is now
making some headway. The capital used
t°_be £75,000; it is now written down t<>
£40.000, and there is no goodwill or
other supposititious assets on the other side.
Practically the cash, book debts and sundry
semi-liquid assets represent the whole of the
liabilities, leaving stock (£33.431) and plant
and factory premises to represent the capital
and the reserves. There is no reason why.
with satisfactory management, the co. as
now constituted should not pay fair divi-
dends. Large dividends in this trade are for
the present out of the question, because the
co. lias to meet the competition of small
tradesmen who do not work under similar
conditions as to hours and wages. Even
with that disability, however, there should
be money in the business with satisfactory
management: and satisfactory management
here' is largely a question of sound costing
and careful estimating.

ALUMINOFERKIC is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-
ment, and many country Water Boards and graziers
for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 20()0 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

For rapid and accurate sizing of samples, the
Hoover Rapid Laboratory Sizer is unsurpassed. An
ordinary hand test over 12 different mesh screens
takes about 10 hours to complete ; the Hoover Sizer
will make the same test in about half an hour. By
the use of one of these Sizers the saving in time
would, in a very short while, cover the small initial
cost of the machine. The machine can be dressed

the property as originally laid out. No ex-
planation is offered for the change. Apait
from minerals the traffic will not earn
axle-grease except in the wool season,
and why the one prospectively good
customer is to be handicapped ( by a
totally unnecessary roadage of 13 miles
or have to construct a “siding for
that distance is altogether beyond compre-
hension. Still 13 miles is a vast improve-
ment on the old road routes of three-figure
mileage to Cobar and Hillston. With a rail-
way close at hand Mount Hope may partly
redeem the mining industry in the western
part of N.S.W. But whatever system of
working may be adopted—taking ore (o fuel
and flux, or fuel and flux to ore —a long
time must elapse before the mine can be
organised to be run on anything like the
scale that its large ore-bodies warrant. The
proposal to utilise those monuments of opti-
mistic folly, the Blayney smelters, seems to
have been dropped, as the machinery on
that mine has been sold and part of it
removed.

The Bank of Adelaide has its jubilee this
month, having started business at the end
of 1865. It began with a drought and 50,000
shares, 30s. paid up, but soon the capital was
put up to £400,000, which has lately been
increased to half a million. There were only
four branches in the beginning—Gawler,
Goolwa, Kapunda and Port Adelaide. There
are now 52, and 36 agencies. Dividends
have never been less than 6 per cent., and
only went below 8 from 1887 to 1899. There
have been only three managers. John Shiels,
who is just completing his 25tli year of
office, had for predecessors Souttar and 11.
G. Wilkinson.
Elsmore tin (N.S.W.) hands out a six-
penny. It has been off the dividend
list for nearly two years, but now
rain has come it will be possible to pump
water from the river and keep two plants
at work. There are 24,000 shares of 10s.,
so a sixpenny costs £6OO.
Amalgamated Hill End (N.S.W.) is
crushing 100 tons for a Christmas cake. The
winze from the tunnel level is down 35ft. on
a vein 3iu. thick, worth about 3oz. per ton.
The famous mica vein has been driven on
right up to Fischer and Beard’s crosscourse,
in the vicinity of which there was an en-
richment. ' But the vein is very small. Five
bags of stone were collected on the south side
of the crosscourse and taken for safe-keep-
ing to the police station. But the enrich-
ment isn’t extensive; for the last 50ft. the
quartz has been only from lin. to 6in. thick
and of “variable value.” It is hoped that
the crosscourse will have enriched other
quartz veins, notably the Star of Peace, and
work is proceeding to prove if it is so. The
mica vein has already produced a cake weigh-
ing 4030 z., worth £I6OO, from 70 tons of
stone. But as the Amalgamated has spent
something like £30,000 it needs to strike a
good many little things like that.

Ardlethan (N.S.W.) record for the year-
Carpathia, two sixpenny divs.; Wild Cherry,
threepenny call; Southern Cross, penny call;
White Crystal, not the faintest rumor of
divs. Various amalgamations are talked
about, in all of which Carpathia figures as
the mine to be benefited by the acquisition of
a local battery. The above-mentioned figures
may explain y/hy, in many quarters, such a
scheme seems so desirable. Tributors have
most of the other shows (Bygoo, Outcast,
Commonwealth, etc.), bar the Homeward
Bound.

There looks to be something lordly when
a co. with an income of £7451 is faced with
head-office charges of £1206 for six months’
work. This is the case with Adelong
Estates. But analysis shows that the State
pockets nearly half the sum for taxes. Inter-
est nibbles £2lO. leaving the balance to
cover fees, salaries, etc. This is quite
modest for Collins House. The ground the
Estates has plodded through up to October
39 last would give a Bright district dredge-
master apoplexy. It averaged thus :
Half-year ended No. 1 Plant. No. 2 Plant.
Oct., 1914 .. 4.058 and. 7.259 and.
A pi., 1915 .. 5.499 and. 11.215 and.
Oct., 1915 .. 6.581 and. 8.304 and.
The low efficiency of the plants was the
handicap, though now things are better.
Costs last half-year were 3.585 and. per cub.
yd. for No. 1 plant and 3.731 and. for No. 2,
but breakages on both dredges meant that
neither worked 80 p.c. of the full time. Now
the type of bucket has been altered and the
bands strengthened so that better records
are talked about.
* * *
After making a steady loss for two or
three months, Associated (W.A.) made a
profit of £439 in November. This turn-un,
together with some improvement in its
Canadian interests, has given the shares a
lift.

The Melbourne-floated Amalgamated
Westralia has been blowing off a bit about
its Mount Margaret leases (W.A.). The
chairman reckons that, “apart from two
main lodes, there are several parallel reels.
The manager goes one better and says that,
on assays and tests, the mine is worth an
ounce per ton. The show has produced a
good deal of gold in its time, but very little
remains in sight, and until further develop-
ment has been done no one can really tell
how it is going to do in future.
* * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) has pur-
chased the Slippery Gimlet and takes con-
trol right away. The show has been worked
off and on for some years by a. local syndi-
cate, and has produced a fair amount of
bullion. The Oroya Links once had it under
option, but turned it down after doing some
development, and after being assured by
Frank Powell and other experts that it
wasn’t good enough. Later on the now
defunct Gwalia South Cos. had a look in,
but left without doing any business. With
an up-to-date treatment plant scarcely more
than a stone’s throw away and a lot of ore
in sight to go on with, the Associated North-
ern may nevertheless be able to make money
where the other two couldn’t.
* * * *
Fremantle Trading alias Fremantle
Smelting Cos. has completed negotiations
with the State Government and Common-
wealth Bank for the financing of its lead
ventures at Northampton and the re-start-
ing of its smelters, which have been idle for
eight years. In turn it agrees to smelt for
the small man at a cut rate plus a Govern-
ment subsidy.
Lake View and Oroya (W.A.) showed a
profit of £35,910 for the year ended June 30,
and paid £36,095 in dividends. This left it
with £22,295 of the £22,480 brought for-
ward from the previous year. An interim
div. of 5 per cent. (£18,047) has since been
paid on account of the current 12 months.
The co. still has a multitude of miscellaneous
mining interests in its safe. These include
seven varieties of debentures, bonds and
preference shares of a total face value of
£173,000, and nearly a million and a quarter
shares of 14 cos., of which B. 11. Block 10
(5700), Lake View and Star (611,599),
Yuanrui Gold Mines (169,036), and Zinc
Corporation are Australian. Excepting
100,000 paids in the Burma Corporation the
rest are Amurkan. The co. also owns the
Brixworth Ironside Cos. and the Queen of
the Hills at Meekatharra (W.A.). Very
little is said about the latter nowadays, and
the inference is that it is on the sick list.
* • * *
Williams in his half-yearly report on the
Edna May (W.A.) shows that he isn’t tak-
ing any risks with the water at 300 ft. lie
has it corked back in the bores, and to beat
it has installed three electric pumps to lift
50,000 gals, per hour. A big flood-gate has
gone up across the crosscut, so that if any
mishap occurs to the pumps the mine won’t
be flooded. With the water to look after Edna
reserves couldn’t be built up except out of
the new make of stone at 225 ft. This seems
to be a part of the lode underlying the
granite bar that gave pluck to the bears a
while since. Williams looks to this forma-
tion to add to the reserves substantially, but
more work will have to be done to establish
this. After milling 15,208 tons for a return
of 90s. 7d. per ton, ore reserves worked out
at 45.670 tons, worth 88s. 7d., or a total of
£202,327. This means that, so much atten-
tion having to be paid to water, feserves
have come down from 60,100 tons to 45,670
tons in the six months. They compare this
way:—
, —May, 1915.— s r-Oet., 1915.-^
Level. Tons. Value. Tons. Value.

Crush dirt came chiefly from the 225 ft. level.
10,042 tons being raised there out of a total
of 18,20 S tons sent to the mill. At this
pace the proved ore will last 2J years, which
will give Williams lots of time to get the
water under. As it is ho curses that the
trouble has hit up his costs to nearly 245.,
with dashed little development in the bdl.
Edna’s tally to date shows what a plum it
was that the prospectors let Tricks pick up:
67,780 tons milled have yielded 63,3600 z.,
valued at £254.955, and sands £31,897 addi-
tional. Divs. have been £3 10s. per share
(or £149.975), so that rather more than half
the gold lias been available for the share-
holders to drop in the Sunday collection-
plate.

Black Range Pinnacles Cos. (W.A.) has
the whole of its plant on the ground, and
erection has started. From 3000 to 4000 tons
are waiting for the battery.

Direct haulage from 1300 ft. level to sur-
face having been established, Ida 11. (W.A.)
hopes to effect a saving of 15s. per ton.
Hitherto mill supplies have had to be raised
from 1300 ft. to SOOft. through an internal
shaft, then trucked 1000 ft. along the level to
the old main shaft, and thus up to the sur-
face. Asa result of this and other expensive
methods of working, costs averaged 455. and
upwards. Now an effort is to be made to
keep them down to 30s.

“D.F.”: Government Geologist Twelve-
trees lias poured a little more cold water
on the hot ideas of the optimists who think
that Tasmania is bubbling with oil. He does
not say it is not there, but he does not speak
with any enthusiasm of some of the most-
boomed localities, and he advises oil-seekers
to go slow and make sure. He indicates as
a place worth trying one that has been
rather overlooked, the saltbeds near Boss, in
the Midlands. Here there are a number of
lagoons which yield every summer a con-
siderable quantity of salt. It used to be
gathered for human consumption in the old
days, and is still used for c'attle. What
Twelvetrees says about it is that where
there’s oil there’s usually salt, though it does
not follow that where there’s salt there is
oil.

The Tasmanian syndicate which at one
time thought of leasing the now idle Zeehan
smelters for experimenting with anew pro-
cess for the treatment of complex zinciferous
ores, including the slag at the smelters them-
selves (this slag contains what the smelters
could not get out of the Hercules ore), has
decided to put up its experimental plant in
Hobart. So the Government which fore-
closed on the smelters after putting £20,000 *
into them is still looking for a tenant. It
has strong hopes, however, that the Mount
Lyell Cos. will use the smelters when the
Hercules-Kosebery deal goes through.
* * * *
George Bryant’s Christmas report on the
Cathc-art Central, Ararat (Vic.), was as
skimpy as a ballet-girl’s skirt. By using a
footrule shareholders can measure up from the
plan that 1900 ft. of the gutter was taken out
north of the shaft, and their bank-books let
them know that 21s. came from the wash.
They can also ascertain that 800 ft. of the
lead from No. 1. to No. 6 rise isn't worth a
cent, to the co. South-east of the poor
ground 550 ft. of the gutter has been stoped
out, leaving another block of SOOft. ahead of
No. 8 rise opened up and prospected. A
portion of this may be a blank through
being crab-holey. As neither Board nor
manager prints an estimate of the extent of
wash proved, or gives the width and values
of the runs of gold crossed in the cutting-up
drives, the shareholder must do a rule-of-
three sum if he wants to judge Cathcart
Central’s possibilities. As the surface bores
on the plan don’t give the height above sea-
level at which they bottomed he can’t know
if the lead is heading straight for the Langi,
as looks to be the case, or whether it is
giving away south. What he does know is
that 4000 ft. distant Bill Toole is picking at
the same gutter and puddling 2oz. stuff.
Putting all the plus factors together there
may be 7s. per share in the block of lead
developed. This leaves 17s. to bring up
profits to the market price of scrip, and
that has to come out of the untouched sec-
tion—beyond the face of the leading drive to
Toole’s boundary. Unless another big crab-
hole is unearthed the risk about not getting
that much need not cause loss of sleep. Last
half-year Bryant puddled 4131 fathoms for
86690 z. at a cost of nearly an ounce per
fathom and paid seven divs. The mine
which it was once thought didn’t carry the
lead has given shareholders 295. per share,
and has still a big block of the gutter
intact to gamble over.
* * » *
Mine workers in Victoria aren’t sure that
their State wages award is more than a
pyrrhic victory. The 15 p.c. increase
promptly shut up the Hope of Beaufort
Deep Leads at Beaufort. Then the Victoria
Proprietary hauled down the flag, and Pea-
cock’s office notified that the Duke Extended,
Maryborough, must stop. Shareholders here
have chucked £30,000 into the gutter with-
out the smell of a div. They don’t like to
cut the loss, but it’s odds on that they will.
Small shows also are sighing out their exist-
ence, so that 1000 or 1500 workers will
soon be padding the hoof if the log stands.
Three Ballarat East mines have just re-
ported losses, and they are expected to give
in; so there will be a lot of bargains for the
machinery man. A.M.A. secretary Little was
warned of this and decided to chance it, but
he and the A.M.A. didn’t expect the men to
be thrown out in the middle of a big war.
The mines that can live are starting to pick
and choose, so that labor, besides being
thrown out of a job, will find that it will
have to bring a sound body when asking to
be taken on somewhere else.
* * * *
This is the plain way to put it —it is
from J. M. Newman’s report on the Sydney-
owned Larut (Malay States) : —-
Profits depend of course on recovery, market value,
and the cost of production. I have already fully
dealt with the recovery. It only remains to state
my belief that the altered dredge will treat over
80,000 yards per month with a recovery of lib. of
concentrate per yard. The average profit from the
164 acres can, therefore, be safely stated at £IB,OOO
a year for 11 years, taking metallic tin at £155
London, a rise or fall of £lO in the London price of
metallic tin being equal to an increase or decrease
in net profits of about £2500 a year,
Newman spent a couple of months on the
property, and checked the bores, besides
determining the modifications in the plant
to suit the ground to be worked. It was
this very capable engineer’s first visit to
the Malayan tin fields. Of course the
recoveries don’t please him (a recovery of
less than 100 p.c. never will please an
engineer of the Newman stamp), but the
available material is beyond his expectation.

Bonnie Dundee now tops the Charters
Towers market at os. per share. Of course
the Bonnie hasn’t had the dividend-paying
record that some of its neighbors have en-
joyed, but because the recently-discovered
shoot of stone is a branch of the Brilliant
reef speculators are sanguine of good
things, and ever since the last crushing of
444 tons for £3405 shares have increased in
favor. The underlay shaft is being sunk
another lift and is now below ISOOft. verti-
cal, and the report that Sin. of good stone
is showing near the bottom of the shaft is
cheering. But so far that reef has proved
patchy.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine per-
fume added, and some Puritol wax.
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects, the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.* . [1

LETTER
Sydney, December 20, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
The old home for Governors in Maequarie-
street is slowly sloughing its covers, though
red baize still drapes the yellow settees in
the ballroom. There will be few changes in
the old place. The long mirrors that used
to reflect the sub-regal person in the ball-
room alcove have vanished, but the Louis
XIV. tables, possibly the most valuable bits
of furniture in the old house, still squeak on
their elegant legs if you so far forget your
manners as to bump them. Ex-Governor
Belmore—an early memory, known fami-
liarly as “Bob,” from his belief in the magic
power of the humble shilling—hangs on
another wall. In former years he used to
turn a wooden stare on the side door. The
room in which successive private secre-
taries. for years chaperoned by a screaming
cockatoo, gave limited information to the
press is now his Ex.’s office. Otherwise the
plan is unchanged.
Saturday's race-meeting represented the
dead-end of millinery pretensions. Three
days’ rain had damped the desire of Woman
to shake her feathers out to dry—assuming
she had any. Yet the afternoon was fine,
though the sun sulked behind leaden clouds.
The members’ stand occasionally held a
crowd of five women, counting the cloak-
room attendant, who was lonely amongst
the scent sprays and powder puffs below.
Disgusted by the squally wind and the lack
of frills, the band hid itself under the grand-
stand. Thence the music came up in snorts
and butted against the shoe-leather of those
above.
The oldest inhabitants, having reckoned
I hat the A.J.C. had never in its history
achieved such a drought of women, settled
down to lose their money as usual. Lord
Xagar, romping home at 16 to 1, brought
yelps of joy from a few macintoshed femi-
nines in the big stand. But the average
man maintained a stony silence at this
climax to the Villiers’ Stakes. Men out to
enjoy themselves wore that detached -air
which accompanies their oldest clothes. A
fur coat on a dark-eyed girl was the most
tremendous sartorial circumstance present.
11. M. Somer and his wife, Arthur Gordon.
Spencer Brunton, Mrs. Caro and a few other
macintoshed forms were seen speeding
towards the stand before a race. Hundreds
of able-bodied young men sauntered through
the wet saddling-paddock. Only a small
percentage of khaki reminded the occasional
woman of the call to arms.
Governor Strickland’s blue-eyed Mary is a
youthful Diana of the Sutton Forest cross-
ways. Her preference for a fence over an open
gate landed her in a nasty cropper the other
week. But there was nothing worse than
bruises to show for it.
Great consternation amongst the military
ladies and allied feminines over the stern
"Thou shall; not enter Egypt” order just
promulgated by the Highest Cannonical
Authority. A cable from Major Clive Dan-
gar to his mother had the effect of stopping
several women who were off to winter in
Cairo. And report says that a great clear-
ance of all merely useless and ornamental
womankind from Egypt is in progress. They
gobble up food that may be required as
rations, and clutter up space required for con-
valescents or workers.
Ex-Governor Chelmsford is in garri-
son with his regiment in India —or
was the other day. But they were
eagerly looking for marching orders to
the Front. The eldest son, who went
from Queensland to an English public school,
is doing his bit in Flanders. The rest of the
family waits and watches in England.
Amongst war-scarred veterans who were
former Helps in Sydney is the Chelmsfords’
Aide de Moleyns. The genial Irish-
man is Convalescent from the severe damages
he sustained in France a while ago.
The Tennyson family has at last added a
girl to the population of Britain. Just at
a time, too, when only boys are wanted. A
daughter, the first in three generations,
recently opened her eyes in the Hon. Alf
Tennyson’s home.
The Sydney Choral Society had a packed-
herring-barrel audience to listen to its medi-
ocre performance of “The Messiah.” Handel’s
massive composition fits the more serious
mood of the average citizen this Christmas.
Many of the recitatives sounded like an
aftermath of battle —-as, “Then shall the
eyes of the blind be opened.” Conductor
Reginald Gooud gets better results from the
big chorus, 500 strong, than from the orches-
tra. The latter often chipped in on the tail
of the vocal phrasing, which was generally
good. Of the soloists, tenor Edward Wynn
was the weakest, and an indifferent rendering
ot a few of the “Messiah” gems in white
gloves was the drab result. Ella Caspers’s
rich voice rang out bell-like in “He Shall
Feed His Flock.” Muriel Barton gave a dig-
nified rendering of the soprano airs. A. K.
Jamieson, the bass, contributed very mild
thunder to the occasion. Cyril Monk led the
orchestra, with the Sydney man, C. Helle-
mann, at the organ. The programme was
starred with the names of members who have
been killed or wounded or are in action.
Captain Dumaresq still clings to duty on
Gibraltar. The willow-wand Aide who
passed round the cake in Clielins fords’ day
was rejected as nob strong enough for active
service. He offered “to take the place of a
better man” on the old rock. So the months
flit and find him at his dull task.
For the long recess the William Cullens
go to their favorite mountain eyrie near
Hobart, and Australia’s Chief Justice
Samuel Griffith and his plump missus
are off to the same cool latitude. The
booking that way has been so heavy that
Vei'brugghen, who meant to get across, had to
put off his trip.
Sir H. T. Donaldson, till lately chief of
Woolwich Ordnance Works, is another Aus-
tralian who has been moved to a bigger billet
during the war. lie is a son of a one-time
Premier of N. S. Wales, and a brother of the
ex-athlete who archbishes at Brisbane.
Another, who died a few weeks ago, was
Master of Magdalen College, Oxford.
Captain Seymour (an uncle of General
Bryan Mahon) Avas years ago Chief of
Queensland police and extra A.D.C. to Gov-
ernor Bowen. Bowen, by the way, is still
remembered in the M.L. hot district. Cross-
ing Lake Tarawera in an open boat, a ter-
rific storm came up. The Bananaland mag-
nate laid himself flat down, flung his big
cape over his head, and muttered Greek odes
(being given that way) till a landing Avas
effected. The Maori roAvers believed the
white man’s incantations saved the show
and respectfully inquired for the recipe.
Seymour’s only son is with the Royal Engi-
neers in Gallipoli.
The present holder of the brewery-and-
buttery Lucas-Tootli baronetcy, Captain
Leonard, owner _of acres on English soil
and more acres in this State, has just per-
suaded Rosa May, daughter of the Bovills,
of Smeeth (wot Smith) Paddocks, in Kent,
where the hops come from, to accept the
insignia of his affection for her left hand.
The groom that Avill be holds a commission
in the Honorable Artillery Company, a
brassbound regiment that is linked with revo-
lutionary days in American history, when
George Washington took a stand in military
matters that A\ r ould certainly have shocked
W. Wilson.
Maitland’s Girls’ Patriotic League
gathered in £lOOO for their Allies’ Dav and
sent its president, Violet Mackay (of the
Amanbah Mackays), to the top of the poll to
be crowned. Sunday concerts brought in
the bulk of the shekels; a refreshment room
Avas responsible for more. As a reward for
their energy the queen’s father sent his
daughter and the secretary and treasurer,
Misses Jean Pender and McLaughlin, to
Manly’s Pacific for a week. Mrs. Ruther-
ford played chaperone.
Medical-officer Colonel Ahearne, of Charters
Lowers, is back in Sydney from Servian and
other fronts until May, when he goes in for
further hefty frontier Avork. You may re-
member his daughter, who had a pretty
dramatic and musical talent. She is noAV
Mrs. Hinsley, having recently wedded a
Royal Engineer. Following the noAv-highest
fashion he has quitted his bride for work in
the Cameroons. .1 don’t know Avhere the
Cameroons are, but I should think some-
where adjacent to Borrioboolagha, on the
left bank of the Niger, where the reformed
natives grew coffee in Dickens’s Bleak
House under the supervision of Mrs.
Jellyby, whose husband’s head left a grease
blob on the wall.
Lord Dick Nevill’s parent, the Marquis of
Abergavenny, has died at the age of 89.
The numerous Nevill progeny, unlike some
of Trollope’s landed gentry, bore their vener-
able father no ill-will for hanging on to his
coronet over time. Some of them gave the old
man stacks of trouble, yet they all appear to
have been proud of the active life sturdy old
dad lived till he was well past 80. The last
tragedy in the family was the death of Rose,
one of the beautiful twin sisters who were
overborne by the eager crowd who tried to
peer into their carriage as they returned
from their first Royal Drawing-room. Violet,
the other sister, died some years ago.
The late Tom Wills Allen’s youngest
daughter, the plump Daisy, Avas married
Avith pomp and circumstance in London a
few weeks ago. The groom who achieved
the well-dowered Australian is Major Watts,
of the Field Artillery on the other side.
Artist Hilder’s health is not so good as his
friends wish it to be. In spite of this
handicap, Hilder, who is always a good
seller, and rarely keeps a canvas for home
decoration, recently had a sketching camp
at Dora Creek. Results may be exhibited
early in the year. Dora Creek is rather
rushed by artists of late. Julian Ashton
has just brought his easel back from the
picturesque spot. Now Gruner is vigorously
smacking on the paint thereabouts.
One of the George Binnie boys, Kenneth,
is engaged to a Neutral Bay girl, Linda
Lloyd. .It is from the Binnie homestead
near Quirindi that the well-known 4D clip
reaches market. Mrs. George Binnie is
auntie to singer Gladys Hay.
Housekeepers are looking over their spec-
tacles at the news that the Chief Secretary
has been asked for a charity vote of £5OO
for “unemployed women.” With high wages
going begging at Christmas time, and any
kind of domestic help hard to catch—even
washer-ladies are coy in view of the holi-
days—the “unemployed woman” must be she
who has forsworn domestic chores.
Amongst the artists who have swapped the
palette for the rifle is Penleigh Boyd. The
tall, slender Australian is a typical boyish
Kangaroo, whose years are older than his
smooth cheeks. He is with the Miners’
Corps.
Good for Mr. and Mrs. Peter Bowling—
former a one-time strike leader! Unless the
war ends early five of their six sons will be
in khaki. Three are already in it, and two
more are anxiously qualifying. Doubtless
the brave mother is praying there may be no
call for the baby.
Artist Bertha Mcrfield, whose decorative
panels depict the Australian gum against
idyllic sunsets, comes from Melbourne this
week.
The new Strickland Aide, Captain Firth,
is to arrive by the Orontes. He is a “Ter-
rier,” young, and still open to engagement.
Needless to say, he has been banging the
enemy. The compliments he received in
return send him this way to recuperate. He
is at Sheffield when he’s at home.
t Etiquette amongst the Voluntary Aid
Nurses has its humors. Amongst many
good women and true who are smoothing the
Kangaroo’s pillow there are a few snobs who
stand upon their dignity. This is about
the size of a threepenny bit. At one sub-
urban Rest Home for Convalescents an un-
written code is severely practised by our
Best People. Rule I.—“ Never recognise a
patient if met in the street”—these men who
were maimed for us in Gallipoli ! Rule 2
commands the Iciest People not to “unbend”
in the wards. At one riverside “Home”
a dame in charge treats the soldiers like the
worst boys in a refractory infant class.
Unfortunately the shortage of trained nurses
—due to their presence at the Front —
makes it impossible to get rid Of these
duchesses.
This is the voice of a misogynist, living-
in the far-away bush in Papua. He wishes
to know why only women write cookery
books, and why all the women who write
cookery books are not spoken to about it.
[The misogynist, by the way, is not quite
right. George Augustus Sala wrote “The
Thorough Good Cook” —and he knew how
to. do it.] Cookery books, the Papuan main-
tains, are meant to teach people to cook.
He has got about all there are, and there
is not one of them that can be put into the
hands of a miserable man living away from
civilisation with any certainty of helping
him to prepare decent food for himself and
his mate. He does not quarrel with the
way in which they tell him to “select a
plump young fowl,” or “take 14 eggs and a
quart of fresh cream,” because he realises
they cannot know that such things are noth-
ing more than a far and radiant vision. But
when they tell him airily to “make a nice
light pie-crust” and direct him to “steam
like a suet pudding,” while telling him
nothing under the head of suet puddings
that is of any value at all, also when they
leave out all the little things that matter
about greasing and bringing to the boil,
and getting off the boil, and stirring, and
so on—things that make or mar the success
of bis miserable dinner —and when they
refuse to furnish him with proper indexes,
and always leave out just the one crucial
point in any receipt that means success or
failure because they thought anybody would
be sure to know that —why, then, the misogy-
nist really does want to know if it’s a new
brand of humor. He says he has taught
himself swimming, diving, photography, the
zither-banjo arid a very fair amount of prac-
tical chemistry out of handbooks, but ordi-
nary handbooks were never like cookery
books or the authors would have been urged
to get work and the publishers would have
gone out of business.
Artist Dattilo-Rubbo’s breaking-up party
consisted of 80 or 90 friends, countrymen
mostly, and pupils. Rubbo presided at the
lightning-sketch board, and later, rushing
where statesmen fear to tread, put in
a vehement claim for a slice of the Allied
Day funds. But Italy is, happily, not suf-
fering the tortures of Belgium, Poland,
Servia or the North of France.
At the Polish depot in Hamilton-street
Miss Czaykowska helped to personally con-
duct visitors through the recent show of gift
garments. Eleven bales of goods leave Sydney
this week for Switzerland. If Hun sub-
marines let them get there safely a Swiss and
Polish committee guarantees to forward the
clothing to almost-naked sufferers. The in-
genuity of some of the women workers for
this depot represents the last word in thrift.
Hitherto warm winter stockings have been
thrown away when the feet became too
aerated for the darning-needle. Woman in
war-time knows a trick worth two of that.
She cuts off the cashmere tops, opens the
seam, puts them together, and buttonholes
the shaped necks. Result, the cutest little
singlets for Baby Kosciusko.
The Society of Artists, which hung up its
usual November show, hopes to exhibit its
wares in March.
The long claw of coincidence sent the
racehorse Meritus from small boy to smaller.
Lawyer A. B. Piddington’s youngster won
the gee-gee in the Melbourne patriotic art
union. Now a Mosman youngster, Norman
Collins, aged four, lias taken over the
animal through his next of kin. Norman
won the horse in an Allies’ Day art union.
A fire destroyed the home of P. Hum-
phries. at Eastwood, the other Sunday. The
place was burnt to the ground, and amongst
the cinders were the ashes of a handsome
carved cedar dining-table. This treasure
formerly belonged to Jock Robertson, at
Clovelly, Watson’s Bay. In bygone days the
old N. S. Wales politician with the warm
yarns and the dreadful voice to tell them
in, used to feast 50 friends around this board.
Hatter David Storey journeyed to
Adelaide to meet his wounded Major son,
who came in the Maloja. On the voyage the
hero felt sufficiently convalescent to put the
usual question to Miss Bennett, a daughter
of the Charles Bennetts who live up Pymble
way.
Dr. Leslie Mclntosh, a son of Mr. Jim,
of Darling Point, departed as medical officer
on a mailboat. Of course he’s bound for
the usual address. Just before leaving he
put an engagement ring on the finger of Lucy
Gregory, a Hunter’s Hill maiden.
Maoriland pricks up its ears at news of
the approaching marriage of Lieutenant
Tahu Rhodes, of Christchurch, lately in-
valided back to the Fog from Gallipoli, and
Helen Plunket, first daughter of one-time
M.L. Governor Plunket. Bishops abound in
both families. Miss Plunket’s grand-dad was
Archbishop of Dublin, while young Rhodes,
through his mother, is related to the late
Bishop Moorhouse, of Melbourne and Man-
chester. Is this, think you, a good omen ?
The Plunkets were handicapped in M.L.
by a scarcity of sovereigns—-they owned
a large family, which was in accord with
Dick Seddon’s policy as to the need of popu-
lation. The vice-regal precept was good,
and M.L. families followed suit and ex-
panded. Lord Plunket still sleeps in a
monocle and only takes it off at 4 a.m. to
go on special police duty in London. Pre-
sent Excellency Lady Munro Ferguson is a
devoted aunt of the Hon. Helen.
Evergreen tenor Phil Newbury sang at the
concert of student Linda Young on a very
wet night last week. The young soorano’s
voice, which soars above ordinary top-
notes, has been dissected by every member
of the long-haired tribe in town. A lively
squabble as to whether the girl’s highest
vocal effort is worth while is still progress-
inp\ Newbury looks rather younger than he
did 10 years ago. Even a Caruso tenor
can’t better that record.
The Army Service Corps committee knows
what it is about in the cake competition that
is now in the last lap. The firm decree is
that all cakes sent in ‘-‘become the property
of the depot.” The committee, which works
in Barrack-street, affably announces that it
will even accept home-made jam.
Roll-of-honor boards were unveiled in
Prince Alfred Hospital with some state the
other day. Prof. Anderson Stuart made
the right remarks about the doctors and
nurses who have gone to the Front. “Andy”
is quite plump these days, and his speeches
are more cushioned than they were in his
leaner years. Asperity melts before a larger
waistline, I suppose.
The Alexandra Hospital for youngsters
sends a cry for help. War funds gobble up
so much cash that the kiddies’ haven has
suffered, like other hospitals. The smallest
gold piece will be thankfully received.
The Sydneyite in search of a dozen
bananas now has to look for them behind
masses of bunting. Every fruitshop has
ccme out in a rash of flags, and the tomato
blushes unseen behind the national emblem
of some ally. The Grecian oyster shivers
unprotected on its slab as it awaits the
latest news from the hot end of Europe; but
the new apricot is proudly confident and
faces the future wrapped mostly in the
colors of Italy.
Yours affectionately.
VANDORLAN.

MAGNESIA FOR DYSPEPTICS.
SPECIALIST RECOMMENDS IT
INSTEAD OF DRUGS.
“Only those in constant touch with suffer-
ers from indigestion and dyspepsia can fully
realise the harm done by the improper use of
drugs and artificial digestants,” remarked an
eminent specialist recently. “Personally I
rarely advocate the use of drugs in the treat-
ment of digestive or stomach troubles, for in
practically every instance I have proved the
underlying cause to be excessive acidity of
the stomach and consequent fermentation of
the food contents. Therefore, in place of the
once widely-used drugs I invariably recom-
mend the use of magnesia to neutralise the
acidity and stop the food fermenting, and the
wonderful results I have obtained during the
past three years convince me that there is
no finer treatment for indigestion, dyspepsia,
etc. It must, of course, be clearly understood
that I do not employ or advise the use of
such forms of magnesia as citrates, acetates,
sulphates, etc. —these would often do more
harm than good ; nothing but pure bis ura ted
magnesia—the form prescribed by physicians
—should ever be used to neutralise stomach
acids. This is not at all difficult to obtain —
in fact, I find that most chemists now stock
the preparation in tablet form in addition to
the ordinary powder. Half a teaspoonful of
bisurated magnesia in powder form, or two
compressed tablets taken with a little water,
after meals will usually be found quite suffi-
cient to instantly neutralise the acidity and
prevent food fermentation, thereby ensuring
painless, natural digestion for even chronic
sufferers.”— Advt,
MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, December 20, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Remembrance Day, with its red, white
and blue Anzac buttons, was worth £6OOO.
The Hennessy dame evidently has a secret
treaty with the Weather Bureau, for she
always gets a fine day for her special shows.
Friday was deep blue and breezy. The big rail-
way station had a striped canvas umbrella
booth strung along the bridge-side. It proved
a fine bazaar site well sheltered from the
wind and handy to the fleeing business men.
The artists outside the Stock Exchange sold
really fine sketches for a mere song and
really awful spray-work fans at fearsome
prices. The holiday crowd, jostling and
elbowing round the open-air picture booth,
had no idea of values, and sketches presented
by picked men in the canvas-and-paint world
were bought up at the price of Christmas
prints.
Menzies’ scored a point on Remembrance
Day when Mrs. Robins shepherded a baker’s
dozen of sweet Hawthorn girls and one
Julius Knight, the last-named looking per-
fectly lovely, with exquisite blue touches of
linen and turquoise rings. Julius not only
recited, but brought socks knitted by his
own hands. The foot wraps were auctioned
and brought £2 10s. a pair. Mary Law made
her violin sing, and her just-arrived English
accompanist was voted a peach—“so beauti-
fully fair,” sighed one healthy brown Aus-
tralian girl.
Thelma Reid, George’s one daughter, was
married last week to Leonard Cleaver, a
Liverpool solicitor. The cable didn’t give us
a word of warning about it. Perhaps it was
deliberate. Twice before Thelma’s old
chums have been told of her approaching
marriage; once the details were very com-
plete. This time George evidently shut down
on all preliminary chattel*.
A military friend tips that Sir John
French’s discovery that the strain of leader-
ship was too great was connected with the
co-ordination of command on the Western
Front, which to all intents and purposes gave
the supreme control to papa Joffre. In 1870
the French resolved that there should be no
higher military rank than general-of-divi-
sion, corresponding to the British lieutenant-
general, it being reckoned that a man hold-
ing higher rank might endeavor to emulate
the late N. Bonaparte. John French being
a Field-Marshal, it would be against mili-
tary etiquette for him to serve under a man
of lesser rank. So he began to think about
his health, and decided that a peerage and
a job at home would suit him better. And,
of course, he was entitled to both.
Commodore Dagg, of the Royal Yacht
Club, joined in with the Williamstown
mayoral people to give a great salty -welcome
to returned soldiers. The boys were taken
down to Williamstown by motor launches
and were returned conveniently to Princes
Bridge. Several owners lent launches, and
the Melbourne Harbor Trust a huge motor
craft. Dixon was there with his new white-
and-gold flier, and Turner and Hansen
brought their high-speed craft. Yachts
were coming up the bay from Brighton and
St. Ivilda for the spree, but a fierce westerly
sprang up and sent the white wings scurry-
ing for shelter. A few venturesome mariners
faced the green and white furies; but it
was a wild, wet business, and they were not
in calling trim when they were through.
Some of the yachtsmen-soldiers went out
for runs in the comparatively sheltered
waters near the Williamstown Club House.
But water sports were ruled out; and vis-
itors who intended to return to Port Mel-
bourne by ferry got a horrible shock when
the Admiral declared that nothing would
induce him to put to sea again that night.
The visitors had, fortunately, been excel-
lently fortified with fodder at the party, so
they faced the tramp to the railway station
with some heart. Miss Byrne (who acts the
part of Mayoress for her father, the Major)
had nice girls in sailor blouses to help with
the tea. Mrs. Underwood was also a helper,
and Mrs. Newlands beamed like a well-
trimmed binnacle-lamp. The local girls said
it was all “just too Sweet for anything” and
that the soldier boys were “dears.” So they
were —but just a trifle blue with the cold.
Amy Nightingale, a Ballarat girl who
spent some years at the Melbourne Uni.
Conservatorium, was studying singing at
Brussels when the Germans started for
Paris. She took an early train for the shore,
dropping luggage on the way, and recalling
all the things she hadn’t even packed up.
When she arrived in London she was prac-
tically featherless; but she is still waiting
there, determined to return to her lessons
some day. A brother, Garnet Nightingale,
was in London when the dash out of Bel-
gium happened; but, once his sister was
safe, he. came back to Australia to wrap up
his affairs and put them away in camphor
until his return from the Front, whither he
lately went with the Engineers.
Marie Hall, the Bendigo heiress, will pro-
bably be no more by the time you get these
tears. This is not an obituary notice, but
merely a hint that she has been infected by
the war-marriage germ. She sent news by
the last mail that she was busy preparing to
say “I will.” Marie was always as tantalis-
ing as she Avas charming. Perhaps this is
the reason why she has denied her Austra-
lian girl pals the joy of knowing the man’s
name. She has promised to send it along
as soon as she has the legal right to use it.
Nellie Bowie, the erstwhile Victorian golf
champion, has many interesting things to
say about the war. She saw millions of the
germs which it breeds, inspecting them
through a microscope at the Lady Dudley
Hospital at Wimmereux. When the war
broke out she was in London with her uncle,
Lieut.-Col. Dr. George Horne. Her bacterio-
logical knowledge got her a passage across
the Channel with him. and she took charge
of the Hospital laboratory. She has just
returned to Melbourne, and the stories she
tells on the golf links are most thrilling.
Some rich people have very middle-class
luck. The Faulkner brother who acquired
the Fiskens’ Toorak humpy found to his
grief that it was not what he wanted, and
passed it on to Maorilander Ivettlewell. Then
the poor man purchased another home in
Sydney. But some burglars saw him coming
and plucked valuables from his family-tree
while he was asleep. He is quite pettish
about it, and talks of going to live in Green-
land.
The George Chirnside matron has pulled
down the blinds of her South Yarra flat and
gone to her Werribee palace, where she will
hold another war-time Christmas house-
party. The guests are chiefly spinsters.
I .ast year there was a scarcity of bachelors;
this year there is positively not one to be
had.
When the news came through that the
son and heir of one of our sheep dukes had
fallen in love with the Red Cross nurse who
tended him after he had been “gassed,” his
despairing relatives emitted loud shrieks
and threw themselves into the wool-bin.
Mother has gone off by P. and O. steamer to
inspect the Young Person, and, if necessary,
forbid the banns. For, of course, everybody
jumped to the conclusion that the fair
unknown couldn’t possibly “do,” and that
the young officer wasn’t competent to choose
a wife for himself.
A number of confirmed trippers are going
to take the American route to avoid a possi-
ble hold-up in the Suez Canal. Mrs. Arthur
Payne, with sister Sybil Stephen, will face
the wintry Atlantic to join husband Arthur,
who is working for one of the colored
Crosses. The Norton Grimwade pair, with
the smallest son, will likewise journey via
America to be near the fighting boys.
Mrs. Leslie Stuart vows that on the night
of the patriotic fete which raged at her
place somebody tried to break in by the front
windows. Scared but alert, she reared her-
self on one elbow and discouraged the shad-
owy thief by shrieking the rotten news that
the money was at Miss Nyulasy’s. The
wretched man was too broken-hearted to
come in and get the address.
Napoleon the Boffard nearly burst with
pride on Thursday night when his compli-
mentary concert happened ; but he managed
to _ sing several little French songs in a
voice tremulous with emotion. Faulkiner
Smith and Norman Trenery ran the business
side of the show, and the usual decorative
programme-sellers got in the way. The G.-G.
sat in the lounge seats with Lady Helen,
who was in black lit up by rubies. Dainty
Doris Blackwood was in white frills. Natur-
ally there was much playing of the “Mar-
seillaise” and many folds and festoons of
the Tricolor. The Gaud Mayor, his wife
and the Maddens were in the special seats.
“Springy”—otherwise and officially Lieu-
tenant-Colonel Springthorpe—is on his way
in to Australia. No doubt he will have a
good deal to say—now or later, when the
air has cleared. Surgeon-Major Stanley
Argyle, of Kew, has already returned from
Egypt. He it was who gave a motor-car
fitted out for X-ray work —the car which
was said to have been dismantled for Cairo
drives.
Phil Finkelstein, of the J.C.W. staff, has
edited a saucy booklet for Christmas, with a
very pink-limbed damsel jumping on the
cover and well-known stage pets grinning
inside. Julius Knight looks serious in a
burglarious soft hat and a lovely striped
collar.
The three Oriental Hotel entertainments
raked in something like £lOOO for the Lady
Stanley appeal. Sassiety women concerned
are now going off to the beaches with con-
sciences light enough to keep them afloat
in the surf.
Captain Burnham, who genthelped and
played polo hereabout, and was nervously
wrecked in the early stages of war, is now
patched up sufficiently to do some work in
the War Office. His wife, who was Maggie
Niall, shadows him devotedly.
The Mayoress of Hawthorn, Mrs. Percy
Russell, is on the warpath after Christmas
geese for soldiers and nurses’ dinners at the
Base Hospital and Rest Home. Five hun-
dred and more guests with good appetites
are expected in the Dome Room at the Base
—and you can work out for yourself how
many birds will be needed. Lady Helen
is being coaxed to come and say a few words.
Swallow and Ariell will shout Christmas
puddings for the crowd, and stacks of donated
vegetables will speak for themselves. There
will be a piano and musicians and a round
of jolly Christmas songs. The men will get
cigarettes in plenty, and Mrs. Russell is
giving the nurses something in white satin
bags made by Mrs. Andrews. Mrs. Percy
Russell has had her own little cigarette
fund going quietly ever since the war broke
loose, and has cabled £lOO a month just for
fags. Her brother, Dr. C. D. Law, is in
Flanders, and has told his energetic sister
how much they are appreciated.
This week the revered Austral Salon is
throwing up its peggy-bag in joyous celebra-
tion of its twenty-fifth anniversary. It
wishes to prove its vitality by donating beds
to the AVomen’s, Queen Victoria and Chil-
dren’s Hospitals and the Homes of the
Ministering Children’s League. Collections
have been taken up, and the results should
make a lot more sufferers comfortable.
A r era Lumsden, daughter of the Alf Lums-
dens, of Hawthorn, is collecting congratula-
tions. She has said “Oh, Harry!” to Harry
Mannall, of Maitland (N.S.W.).
Mrs. Enid Whiting-AVaters is tossing her
white lancer’s hat-plume with pride since
her colonel-husband got a high-grade appoint-
ment at British Headquarters, where he
swaps cigars with the generals. The staff
warrior’s wife is wondering if she will oe
allowed to land in Egypt. According to
present arrangements she is going to Cairo
in the beginning of the year. Mrs. Newbigin
(whose young husband is on transport
work) is going with her, and Mrs. Leslie
Stuart will accompany her sister “just for
the blow.”
Adelaide looks over the fence: —-
The March Show is “off,” though the R.A.S. hopes
to hold a record-breaker in September of next year—
by which time it will be two years since the last
of these bovine frivolities. Meanwhile, the construc-
tion of the new showgrounds at Wayville West pro-
ceeds, and £11,903 of the £15,000 granted by the
Government has been spent.
The summer exodus has commenced, and I feel like
the boy who stood on the burning deck. Tlie Win.
Holes, with their two small children, have departed
to England, and the old hands of Victor Harbor
and Mount Lofty are getting back to Nature in special
costumes and sun-veils. After Commemoration Day
there was heavy booking for the eastern States.
Professor Henderson, Professor Kerr Grant, and T. A.
Caterer all went to Melbourne or Sydney; and
Tommy Ryan packed his bags for Tasmania and the
Zeehan School of Mines.
There has been a shuffling of jobs at the Univer-
sity. Dr. J. C. Verco has resigned after 25 years of
lecturing on the principles and practice of medicine,
and Dr. Swift has taken his place; and Russell Booth
and R. M. Steele are to give the instruction in
accountancy and business principles formerly handed
out by Mr. Colvin.
We’re rather proud of the Uni. war-record. Three
members of the council, Professor Watson and seven
other members of the teaching staff, four of the
administrative staff, 100 graduates and 105 students
are at the Front. Among them are eight Rhodes
Scholars.
Crown Solicitor Dashwood retires at the end of
the month, with eight months’ leave of absence to
hammock in.
A cable from London announces the death of Mrs.
A. W. Smith, widow of the late Dr. Smith, of Hali-
fax, England, and mother of Mrs. Evan Kyffin
Thomas. Her son, S. C. Kaines Smith, is a well-
known authority in England on Greek art and
archaeology. Mrs. Smith was a daughter of the
late J. H. Kaines, of this hamlet.
Having sent 300 men to the Front out of a total
population of 2500, Renmark has bought a motor-
ambulance and handed it over to the military. Places
like Renmark keep the old voluntary idea alive, for
all the slackers boast about the glorious example and
ask proudly: “Could conscription do better than
that?” Meanwhile the War Council’s latest move
is to arrange a special women’s recruiting meeting,
with an appeal to women by women, and the
Mayoress in the chair.
A. W. Marshall, founder of S. Marshall and Sons’
music warehouse, died at East Adelaide on Thursday
after a long illness. Of his three sons one is with
the Australian Naval Bridging Train and the other
is working in an aeroplane factory in England.
A Christmas tree for the children of soldiers at
the Front was lighted at the Adelaide Town Hail
during the week. The cheery idea was conceived and
carried out by a committee that has been visiting
the wives of some of the men since the. departure
of the first contingent.
Alfred Catt, who came to the State in ’49
and has put in 25 years in Parliament, has just
indulged in his 82nd birthday. Well, it won’t occur
again.
James Ashton’s Students’ Exhibition was opened by
Speaker Coneybeer, who passed a bouquet of kind
words to the veteran teacher for the work he has
done.
The brisk Cheer-Up Society, formed in November,
1914, to brighten the lives of S.A.’s second contin-
gent, who were being a little neglected in camp in
the rebound from the enthusiasm lavished on the
first, has held its first annual meeting. It now has
big funds and a central “hut,” used as a clubroom.
This, with equipment, cost about £l5OO. In the
year 10,000 free meals have been given, including
welcomes and send-offs. The work in other direc-
tions has grown so much that Mrs. Seager, the
original organiser, has been made a salaried official.
Archibald Whyte, the energetic young
man who represents the S. M. Herald in
Melbourne, wedded on December 15 Doro-
Uiea Jones, the jolly little Titian-haired only
child of the H. 11. Joneses, of Collins-street.
They were united at great length and with
the utmost solemnity at St. Peter’s, on East-
ern Hill, just at sunset. The sunset colors
of the stained-glass windows and the sunset
colors of Dorothea’s hair were harmonised
by the bride’s short dress of dull blue filmi-
ness over adorable lace, and folded back with
pink-red chiffon. Behind the principals stood
a fresh-cheeked bridesmaid in faded rose and
a grey-garbed best man. Mother wore black,
veiling ivory-lace, and dad held up a vieux-
rose tie. A handful of intensely interested
feminine relations watched in the large dim
church, and later all hands motored round
to the Collins-street flat for chicken and
champagne. The bridegroom’s mother tele-
phoned her blessing from Sydney at cake-
cutting time. A conspicuous present among
the heaps of silver and soft silky things
was a seascape by Alf Vincent, accompany-
ing a cheery little message written by the
artist two months ago.
At her humpy, Brie Brie, Mrs. John San-
derson brought her quartette of supper con-
certs to a successful conclusion and roped
in over £3OO for Lady Stanley’s Wounded
Soldiers’ Fund. At the final concert the
hostess sang something from “Louise,” and
Walter Kirby, with his marmalade-colored
hair convulsed with sentiment and emotion,
gave spoonfuls of his favorite Puccini. Rita
Hope, Mrs. Ellis and Hal Elvins aided and
abetted.
David Low, C. J. Dennis and Hal Gye
were invited to a dinner at the Cafe Fran-
eais on Friday to explain how they had
gulled the public into buying large quanti-
ties of their recently-published books. An
air of dignity was lent to the impudent
gathering by the presence of Andrew Fisher,
who takes a large size in dignity even for a
High Commissioner; Frank Tate, chief of
the Education Department; headmaster
Adamson, of Wesley College, and several
others who, so far as is known, have never
been guilty of anything so disreputable as
verse or black-and-white. But the majority
were spoilers of nice, white paper and Bris-
tol board. Nearly everybody made a speech,
and one well-known wayfarer was just issu-
ing a fifth edition of well-chosen remarks
when the early-closing law intervened.
Mrs. Carty Salmon is trying to shoo a
Christmas dinner together for the Women’s
Hospital. Poultry is very dear this Decem-
bex% and it is easier to snare the Blue Bird
of Happiness than find an open-hearted citi-
zen who has enough loose coin in his pocket
to buy a couple of turkeys.
It was a shock to the romantic when
Andrew Fisher returned by train and began
to eat his way through farewell banquets.
Some of the dreamers had the splendid idea
that he was camel-riding through to a West-
ralian port on his way to the English flesh-
pots.
The commercial travellers of Launceston
(Tas.) had their Red Cross riot the other
afternoon. When they counted the cash
they had £730 in the bag, and exes, are not
worth mentioning. The best moneymaker
was a special cookery book got out for the
occasion. It brought in £l31 —and Heaven
knows how much indigestion.
Actor-manager Bert Bailey has done seven
weeks of one-night stands in the country
townships—an unprecedented thing for a big
metropolitan co. The tour has been so suc-
cessful that they are extending it indefinitely
into next year instead of breaking up for
Christmas. Of course “On Our Selection”
is the bait. The greasepainters even reached
Mildura, which had never before smelt can-
vas scenery in its life.
I can’t help thinking that some of these
letters from soldiers that we read in the
newspapers are like the love-letters of cer-
tain poets—strict confidences specially pre-
pared for general circulation. Picture to
yourself the triumphal home-coming of a
1915 warrior who has been writing hard for
literary fame between battles. What would
he be most likely to do if he found that the
family had lovingly stowed away his purple
patches instead of hurrying off with them
to the nearest newspaper? Would he kiss
mother on the brow? No, dear, this is the
most literary war the old earth has seen,
and it is the duty of all us women to see
that our heroes’ despatches get the space
they deserve.
A high-toned English girl, writing to a
prospective sister-in-law in this part of the
world, says: “I visited the Australians in
camp. They looked quite nice, but I did
not understand a word they said.” Perhaps
discretion was the better part of dullness.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY dear lad wore such true love looks
As he and I did part,
Was laughter in my homing step
And wild glee in my heart.
Oh ! he was straight and strong —could lift
Ale. throbbing, o’er his head ;
Like lions, tawny-gold, his eyes
That would not be gainsaid.
He went to lap his strength in blood —
I cared not how or why ;
I said, youth ever goes to war
Then home where love may lie.
As I came by the open door
Aly sister stood and stared ;
She marked me come in cold disdain,
Nor asked how aught had fared.
I had not dreamed that earth held pain,
That Hell was anywhere;
I traced but scantest meaning in
Aly sister’s brooding stare.
Aly sister had the white, white throat,
The wild red lips that call,
Brown eyes a-droop upon a breast
To drive men mad withal.
But now she seemed a frozen thing
That almost gat me fear;
So curtain-like her silences
Fell round when I was near.
But still I went about the day
Light-foot and well at ease;
At night my lad’s eyes lit my dreams
As stars do summer seas.
One dawn my sister moaned in fear
Or pain—I could not know ;
lake writhing snakes her hair fell wild
Athwart her bosom’s snow.
“He loved me first,” she cried. “O God !”
And then she swooned and died.
A little, cold, dead babe was all —
And I was left beside.
How fell a dawn ! yet presently,
Aly sister lying dead.
I, tearless, thought. “Aly lad is free;
Aly lad is mine,” I said.
Aly dear lad wore such true love looks
As he and I did part;
Yet now was mine a laggard step
And wild fear in my heart.
He comes not for my long-dead hope,
He comes not for my fear;
He comes not either day or night,
He comes not ever near.
Until the Doom my sister waits
A riven soul, athirst;
Until the Doom she ghostly cries,
|“0 God! he loved me first!”
Until the Doom the dead babe waits
And will not be gainsaid ;
With eyes of tawny-gold to search
Aly lad’s eyes, undismayed.
Until the Doom he cannot come.
However I may pray;
Uhf;il the Doom I cannot know
What God to us shall say.
I only know that all is pain
And Hell is ev’rywhere ;
And in my dreams I do but see
Aly sister’s brooding stare.

MALCOLM ARNOLD.
Monday Morning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT had been an average morning.
The baby had cried most of the
night; and it seemed to him that all the
night he was waking his wife to tell her to
keep the child quiet. Being a perverse baby,
she always chose the night for her exhibi-
tions of temper and displays of long-distance
howling, instead of the day, when it
wouldn’t have mattered so much, since her
father would have been at his office.
Pie had often complained to his wife about
this habit of the baby, and she had remarked
that sometimes the baby was worse during
the day. But he put that down to her
feminine imagination, because he was never
home during the day, and on Saturdays and
Sundays there was, of course, his golf. But
no baby could be worse during the day than
his was during the night.
And then, at 5 a.m., just when he had
hoped to get a little sleep, the other two
children had awakened, and insisted upon
playing circus across his bed. He was much
too sleepy and exhausted forcibly to remove
and chastise them; but all the same he
thought his wife might have spoken sharply
to them and let him have a little well-earned
peace. Rest was so necessary to him —
with his long day’s work at the office ahead.
“If a man doesn’t get a good night’s rest,”
he snapped at the breakfast table, “how on
earth is he going to get through his work
during the day?”
“But, dear,” said his wife soothingly, as
she tied Peggy’s feeder round that wriggling
child’s neck, placed the baby on her high
chair, sugared John’s porridge and poured
out her husband’s tea, “I didn’t get very
much sleep, either.”
“Well,” he said aloofly, “that’s your job,
isn't it, looking after the children? Easy
job, too. compared with my work. You can’t
expect me to look after them —with all my
days spent in the office.”
“Oh, no,” said his wife hastily, slapping
John for deliberately spilling his cocoa,
sugaring Peggy’s porridge, wiping the bread-
the baby’s face, and serving
her husband with bacon and eggs.
“All I say is,” her husband pathetically
remarked, as he started on the bacon, “that
if I am upset this way before I even leave
for the office, how do you expect me to
earn enough to keep you and the children
going in the ease and comfort you demand?”
“Quite so.'’ his wife replied, consoling
John, who said he was sorry ; soothing the
baby, who was yelling out of sympathy for
John; pouring out her husband’s tea: and
telling Peggy not to jig her feet, because it
annoyed daddy ; “but mine is rather a trying
job, too.”
“Oh!” her husband, busy over the war
cables, politely muttered, “ that's only play.
Besides, all women love looking after chil-
dren. But they get on my nerves, and a
business man needs to have all his faculties
about him.”
“I’m so sorry, dear,” his wife said, snatch-
ing baby’s mug just as the imp was hurling
it to the floor, telling Peggy to stop singing,
O'OH!
FIRST YOUNG PERSON : “ What’s her latest
nor el like?”
SECOND DO.: “Perfectly red-hot! I can't
even GUESS what half of it means."
and lacing up John’s boots; “but really
everything seems to be going wrong this
morning.”
“It’s the same every morning!” her hus-
band retorted. “ ’Pon my word, I get more
consideration in my office than I do in my
lu me.”
“I’m sure I do the best I can, what with
the children and everything,” his wife
replied, looking for John’s school-cap, which
was, as usual, lost; slapping Peggy for some-
thing or other, and forcing food into the
baby’s reluctant mouth.
“Here I am,” her husband said in a hurt
tone, “slaving all day and every day in a
beastly office, just to keep you and the chil-
dren in comfort. And what sort of home
do I come to after a long day’s work? A
pandemonium! No peace and quiet, even
at breakfast —just children, children every-
where. Nice reward for all my work ! And
all you’ve got to do. the whole day, is to
stay at home and look after the children.
I’d just like to see how you’d stand a day
in the office !”
His wife looked wistfully up to him; but
she was too busy despatching John to school,
soothing Peggy with a lump of sugar, and
mopping up the baby, who had got most
of her bread and milk down her neck, to say
anything in reply.
AH she remarked was that it was quite
time her husband started for his boat.
“Late again—bother the children!” he
cried, and jumping up he pecked at his wife's
cheek. She was too much occupied in smooth-
ing John’s hair, untying Peggy's feeder and
slapping the baby, to respond. But at the
door he turned. He shouted above the din
that she wasn’t to forget to mend that shirt
of his, to water the garden, to iron the
crease in his dress trousers, to ring up the
“HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT."
“Mummy, God doesn't love me!”
“What nonsense , Harry hoy; how can you
say such things?"
“ It's true, Mummy. I tried Him with a
daisy."
plumber about the bath-heater, to telephone
his mother, who was ill. to wash the dog. and
—oh, any other little thing she thought of.
Then from that noise and confusion he
escaped, with the depressing consciousness
that all this worry was the worst possible
preparation for his long day’s toil in the
office.
Yet as he boarded his ferry-boat and made
Ins way to the smoking compartment, where
ho met and jovially greeted his neighbors,
you would not have thought that he had just
left his cosy and comfortable home for a
long, weary day’s toil. Indeed, there was
almost a heartiness in Lis voice, as he dis-
cussed the war-cables and his handicap in
next Saturday’s bogey competition—topics
that his wife had ntver the time to consider
intelligently—that might almost have sug-
gested a sense of relief. He did not look
like a convict condemned to a hard day’s
labor: he looked as if he had received an
unexpected reprieve, as if he was going to
have a holiday.
But he was on his way —and every Mon-
day morning he was on his way —to a week’s
solid labor in a quiet and peaceful office,
where his stenographer was not allowed to
intrude any of her own private worries upon
him. where his clerks spoke softly and court-
eously, where no disturbing noise of the
world was allowed to distress him, and where
everything went in order and without out-
side distractions. It was true that he
had a badly-needed hour off, when he was
able to recuperate his wasted strength with
a calm and well-cooked lunch at a restau-
rant, waited upon by nice-looking waitresses
who anticipated every want of his, and
whose only duty and pleasure was to min-
ister to him. And then he needed a pipe,
a game of billiards or dominoes and a talk,
just, to take his mind off his heavy ousiness
worries, before he could return to his after-
noon’s toil. That long afternoon of labor
was broken, it is true, by afternoon-tea,
daintily made for him by his dainty steno-
grapher. and adorned with a little light con-
versation—no flirtation, of course, but just
an amiable pretence of flirtation that was
absolutely necessary to take his mind, for
half an hour, from his serious business pro-
blems, and give him strength to struggle on
til', five o’clock.
He did not hurry home. There was no
need. His wife had to bath the children and
put the baby to bed, and see that the cook
did not spoil the heavy dinner he liked. So
he drifted round to his club, had a drink or
two and a yarn, in order to keep his strength
up until he dined, and returned to his home
just in time for dinner.
And he kissed his wife with the con-
sciousness that lie had done one more honest
day’s toil for her and the children. He
noticed that she wasn’t looking very bright.
Not strong ! Strange, too ! Look at him !
After a long day’s work he came home feel-
ing almost fit. And she, with nothing to do
all dav, seemed almost played out.
“And what have you been doing?” he
genially asked.
“Oh.” she sighed, “just pottering about,
looking after the house and the children.”
For a moment he almost envied his wife.
What wouldn’t he, the toiling slave, give just
to be able to potter about at home all the
day, and every day?
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The Romantic Crocodile.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'V'l7 HITE folk of this prosaic and
V V enlightened age aver that the age
of miracles has passed. Well, if
this is so, Bogi, of Hannabada, must be a
liar, for he swears by all his gods that the
story is true.
About 20 years ago a Koiari girl, whilst
filling her bamboos at the Laloki River,
heard the shingle rattling behind her, and
on looking round was terror-stricken to see
a huge crocodile waiting with mouth gaping
and tail raised, ready to seize her. She
collapsed, whimpering, and the monster
stood over her. She fainted, and on coming
to, found herself clasped to his cold,
armored bosom, whilst the croc., with his
awkward forehand, patted her shoulder.
When he saw that she had her wits he
raised himself on elbow and hip and pro-
posed.
Knowing what her fate would be if she
refused his wish the poor girl surrendered
without argument, hoping, that her appa-
rent resignation would lead her captor to
be less watchful, and that she might thereby
escape. As soon as he received his answer
Air. Croc, got the girl to sit astride him,
and walked away with her into the river.
Aware that she couldn’t breathe below
water, he kept on the surface. During the
next several moons she was introduced to
every crocodile in the river. At length the
bridegroom swam back to where he had
captured his love, and announced that she
was free to go home, informing her at the
same time that neither she nor any children
she might subsequently have need-ever fear
the saurians in that river.
Time elapsed and she had a son. In a
rage of jealousy this boy killed another
native, and the white men imprisoned him.
He was heavily leg-ironed, but he escaped,
crawling ten miles through the scrub to the
Laloki. He was in sore plight with hunger
and exhaustion, but the crocodile-infested
river must be crossed. Suddenly he heard
the native police calling to one another as
they followed his tracks through the jungle,
and, in a flash, recollecting the promise
made by the crocodile to his mother, he
crawled to the edge of the brown water and
called.
Then up and down the river as far as
he could see came the saurians, racing. As
they gathered, he gasped out his predica-
ment, and they straightaway fell in, side
by side, like a regiment on parade, and
across them the boy hobbled into the scrub
on the other side. There he met a hunting
party from his village, who broke his
shackles and took him home.
The squad of police tracked him to the
beach, read the signs that he was still ham-
pered with the leg-irons, and saw that the
river was aswirl with crocodiles; so they
turned back and reported : “That feller boy
he catchem Laloki all right, irons he fast
along leg belong him, plenty alligator he
stop, he altogether finish.”

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Nick Bottom”: “Barcoo’s” snake (B.
5/11/’l5) is not the only one erroneously called the
tiger. On the Tweed River (N.S.W.) there is a
reptile locally known as the tiger snake, though it
is devoid of anything in the way of poison
fangs. It is reddish brown, with markings some-
thing like those of the carpet, and a crimson
waistcoat. Like the carpet it is of nocturnal habits
and preys on mice, small birds, frogs, etc. I have
seen the same snake on the Richmond River, where,
in addition to being misnamed the tiger, it is called
the doll-eyed snake. Anyone oblige with the correct
label ?
* * *■ *
“Eryander” : Followed along George street
by a small crowd, he was fitted with many a specu-
lative designation, ranging from “small polar bear”
to “Siberian wolf-hound”; but I thought I recog-
nised an old acquaintance, though the color beat
me. “Can’t place him,” I said to the man at the
other end of the leash. “I’d have called him an
Old Smithfield, only” “Only he’s white. That’s
it! lie’s a Smithy right enough, but he’s the
only one of his color that’s ever been known. That’s
why his price is”—lofty figure mentioned. This
old English cattle-dog, or Smithfield—a strange
sight to the Australian stockman —weighs up to
751 b., is coated like a Skye-terrier, and rarely re-
joices in a tail, a characteristic that has brought
him into the raging biological controversy about the
possibility of transmitting artificial modifications.
Certain it is, at all events, that Julius Caesar, refer-
ring to this ancient breed, comments upon the
strange custom of cutting off the tails of the
puppies, and that now, 2000 years later, it is
exceptional for one to be born with a tail.
* * * *
“Kosciusko” : At my koine a pail’ of blue
wrens built a nest in a vine encircling a window,
and in due course’ baby arrived and proved to be—
a cuckoo. Doubts as to the parentage having been
satisfactorily settled, and Mrs. Wren’s explanations
accepted, the task of feeding his nibs commenced.
The cuckoo is already much larger than a sparrow,
while either of the foster parents could be placed in
a. walnut shell; but they are bravely working over-
time to supply the insatiable demands of the fraud.
It is grotesque to see the small workers stowing food
into a mouth that could almost swallow them. 1
know it is a common habit of old mother cuckoo to
leave her eggs lying around promiscuous, but I’ve
never known her to carry one in her beak and
deposit it in a blue wren’s bedroom. Yet that’s almost
the only way she could leave it there.
* * * *
“F.R.H.”: Pass the golden glory of the
wattle and let the bards enthuse about the silver
splendor of the hickory tree. Taller than the
wattle, it towers in the New England (N.S.W.)
bush, and is in October and November one mass of
yellow bloom. The wonder is that this fine tree is
not extinct, for not a great many years back bush-
men made a decent living by stripping hickory bark,
which was generally worth about 50s. per ton at
stump. Of course, every tree so stripped died right
out. The only ones spared, those then too small to
be profitable, are now well developed, and should be
protected before some enterprising coot takes up the
stripping industry again.
WHERE HIS THOUGHTS LIE.
“Hands up, or begobs I blow yer brains out
fer yer!”
“D.F.” : About the mound-building turkeys
breeding in captivity (B. ■ 2/12/T5). In her Beau-
maris Zoo at Hobart Mrs. 11. L. Roberts has a
pair which have built a first-class mound. Judg-
ing - by the row they make when any outsider goes
within cooee of it there ought to be enough eggs
inside to hatch out a whole flock of turkeys.
GROSSLY MISINFORMED.
BOOZEY PERSON: “Shay—whish is the other sider rood?”
JOHN A265 : “Why, over there, av course.”
B.P.: “ Lyin’ hound over there tole me other side teas over here.”
“Albanius”: Three hundred miles south-
east of Java little Christmas Island rises
sheer from unfathomable depths to a height
of 1200 ft. above sea-level. There a phos-
phate industry is carried on which necessitates the
employment of European overseers and about 700
Chinese coolies. The Europeans’ bungalows are
back from a small beach 100yds. long. At a certain
season a colossal army of red-brown land crabs makes
its way from the top of the mountain to the water’s
edge, where they breed. . Nothing diverts them from
their course, so one wakes up in the morning to find
crabs in the mosquito-nets. Shortly afterwards the
beach is absolutely obliterated by a seething mass of
crabs of all sizes. Back up to the top of the moun-
tain they travel again in millions—via the bunga-
lows!—to feed and live on the undergrowth till the
next season. Can anyone tell me where else in the
world crab-life is so abundant and so conspicuously
unconcerned at the presence of people?
* * * *
“Donzo”: I reckon I know something
about Australia. During the past 17
years I have got over 110,000 miles
between Norinanton and Cape Howe
and the East Coast and Menindie.
Take off, say, 300 miles by coach, 180
by motor and 200 by train, and the
horse has done the rest. My record
month was Census time (1911), when
I rode 982 miles in 30 days. I never
saw a post-office during that period,
and got 11 white men and two white
women to add to the other few of the
population. I’d like to know if any
Abo. can beat this for a single-handed
trip. Drovers and others who go in mobs needn’t
apply.
“Pardon” : Here’s the cure for horse corns
asked for by “W.P.C.” (B. 11/11/’l5). Remove the
shoe, and with a very sharp shoeing-knife and fine
glass-paper pare the excrescence as thin as possible,
after which attack the growth with a nitrate-of-
silver pencil, and cover the wall of the foot with a
thin layer of shellac. Encase the hoof in a leather
boot and leave the moke in a soft yard for a couple
of days. A spell of about two months in a soft
paddock, preferably a swamp, followed by careful
shoeing, should complete the cure. P.S. —If the
above won’t answer, the only thing to do is to sell
the horse to the Defence Department.
“Billy T.”: They had been going for three-
quarters of an hour at Hammerton’s shanty. liyley
had hit Kelly with a pewter-pot after some slight
disagreement over the relative virtues of Corkonians
and men of Sligo in the field of battle. Kelly had
responded by bending Kyley’s spine across the bar
counter and biting his ear. Kyley then hit Kelly
with a three-legged bush stool, and Kelly threw
Kyley into the road, and rushing him got his face in
2ft. of dust, and had him well on the way to being
comfortably smothered when Bray and Holden in-
tervened. On recovering, Kyley swiped Kelly across
the small of the back with a stick, and while Kelly
was down thinking it over Kyley trod on the enemy’s
stomach. The men then squabbled for 15 minutes,
gouging, biting, kicking, punching, scratching and
knocking each other’s heads violently against the
globe. Kyley was on top when Bray and Holden
again called time, and it took seven minutes to
disengage him from Kelly’s whiskers. While Bray,
Holden and Kyley were arguing the question of the
propriety of such conduct, Kelly kicked Kyley. This
too was a fundamental error, but Kyley was not
insisting on strict etiquette; he threw a boulder at
Kelly and broke the glass of his watch. Regaining
his vivacity he attacked Kyley with an old horse-
shoe for luck. Kyley sat with his back to a tree
blinking stupidly. Kelly stood off, dispassionate,
judicial. “There, Kyley, be still,” said he. “I tell
you ’tis no use thryin’ t’ pick a quarr’l wid me!”
“Lou” : I know a man who has a sheep-
shearing machine that will revolutionise jumbuck
barbering if, as he puts it, he can break through
the combine. He started with the idea of rob-
bing weak, drought-bitten sheep of their embroi-
dery out in the paddock, and he now has an imple-
ment that can be carried about in the tucker bag,
fastened to a tree, log, fence or stake, and (this
is where the revolution comes in) it cuts both ways,
going up and coming back. That’s all I can say at
present except that he is an Australian bushman.
(Continued, on page 26.)
BROTHER-IN-LAW AND I.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This world of ours is a mixed-up world, as no doubt
you’ve heard before;
And it may be more of a mixed-up world—or it
mightn’t—“after the war.”
(I could have managed a middle rhyme with “The
battle flags unfurled,”
But the soiled-white rag and the Red Cross flag are
all that count in the world
At the present time) —damn the middle rhyme!
This song, as you’ll agree,
When you’ve read it through has mostly to do with
my brother-in-law and me.
Wc shore and swore in the dust and heat of the
sheds of a bygone day,
And the damper and mutton were always sweet as we
marched with our cheques away.
We lived the life of the Level Lands out there in the
Land of Men
(We have known the hills, we have known the sands
of the Upsan Downs since then) ;
We had no blasted relationships, for we’d left our
tribes behind —-
Wc were mates in the truest sense of the word of
the real Australia! kind.
My brother-in-law and > were mates in the days
when our hearts were young;
And we knew little of loves or hates, and less of a
woman’s tongue;
We carried our swags on the Mulga Track, and
camped ’neath the Starlit Sky—
My name was Jim and his name was Mack (my
brother-in-law and I),
But names have little to do Outback, as most of
you bushmen know;
I remember the days when his name was Jack and
mine, I think, was Joe.
When we came to a “town” where the mirage curls
in smoke from the blazing track
We shared our money and shared our girls (which
was always the way Outback) ;
We bore no signs of the cities’ work, we were
healthy and young and free,
The Darling timber and roofs of Bourke were all that
we cared to see.
We had no wives and no wasted lives, we had no
thoughts of the past,
But, alas! and alack! we drifted back to the city
streets—at last!
Now Mack he married my sister Liz, as brothers-in-
law will do,
And I, to show ’em what mateship is, I married
his sister Lou.
Mack found he’d married my tribe, he did, and soon
he longed for the tracks ;
And, before there was ever a thought of a kid, I
found I had married the Macks!
It was Hell all round with their paltry hates for
men from the western sky,
So we took to drink, and were boozing mates, my
brother-in-law and I.
My brother-in-law he got divorced, as brothers-in-
law will get
(They are mostly helped by a mother-in-law or a
sister-in-law, you bet!).
My relatives said that if I was a man I’d go and
riddle the brute!
They seemed to forget, as relatives can, that my
brother-in-law could shoot.
But I wasn’t a man (so it would appear), for less -
than a month went by
When we met again and we had a beer, my
brother-in-law and I.
I’ll tell you a secret, and only you and the rest of
the world and Liz:
I reckon my people had more to do with the wreck
of his life than his.
And the years went past, and—anyhow, I got
divorced as well;
Perhaps on account of the same old row (I’m
damned if I can tell).
And sometimes after a beer or nip (or maybe
more), we’d try
To study out our relationship, my brother-in-law
and I.
“Were we divorced? Or was it a draw? Were we
mates as in days gone by?
Or brothers still in the sight of the Law, my
brother-in-law and I?
Was he “Uncle Mack,” who had been Outback, and
his nephew my son Bill?
Was I “Uncle Jim,” who had been with him, and
his son my nephew still?
But we’d have another, and give it best with a
sort of fraternal sigh—
We still were mates .in spite of the rest, my brother-
in-law and I.
My brother-in-law is off to the war (and I am with
him, too) ;
His son and mine in the firing-line are doing what
they can do.
They are pals we heard from a little bird, and gay
in a game that is grim.
And they’ll be surprised when they get word from
Uncles Mack and Jim.
It’s a mixed-up world, as I said before, and the
end I cannot descry,
But you can't complain that we’ve lived in vain,
my brother-in-law and I.
N.S.W.
HENRY LAWSON.

“Bad Australian”: For some years past
Argentine breeders have been making great efforts
to improve their cattle, and they have succeeded
so far that in the three central provinces the ani-
mals are of first quality, particularly the Shorthorn
and Hereford. Outside these provinces the great
majority of animals are like the scrub cattle we
used to have in Gippsland and the Upper Murray
country, killing about or 4 cwt. of beef. A few
days ago a local breeder sold a consignment of 32-
mcnth steers for a shade under £34 per head, and
at last Palermo show the champion Shorthorn bull
brought £5240. A few days ago “Americus,” the
champion long-price bull of the same breed, died.
This bull was sold by his breeder two years ago for
£7OOO. This is the kind of competition Australia
is up against, and it is almost as keen in the matter
of sheep. Argentine horses are generally a weedy
lot, and little interest is taken in improving any
of the breeds other than the horse used for gambling
purposes. There is one great handicap on the
Argentine stock-raiser, and that is disease. The
whole country is more or less covered with aftosci
(foot and mouth disease) and sarna (scab). So
prevalent are they that they may be regarded as
national institutions. But even with these disad-
vantages, topped off with the periodical langoota
(locust), the Argentine promises to give Australia a
very hard run for her money. The Republic also
suffers from the Yankee meat cormorant, which is
the worst disease of all.
* * * *
“The Reefer”: I took automatic pistols
with me on two protracted excursions in Papua, and
learnt to really curse as a consequence. In the
scrub thereabouts it rains regularly every after-
noon, so firearms have to receive a lot of attention.
Winchesters and the better sorts of revolver stood
the weather all right, but the complicated, delicate
mechanism of the pistol, instead of remaining auto-
matic, were frequently so r/fettmatic that they
simply couldn’t work. The wire spring which
operates the cartridge clip gradually weakens with
use, whatever care be given it, and there is no
alternative way to get a cartridge into the breech.
Barrackers for the auto, say that the right-angled
stock is conducive to accurate shooting, and it cer-
tainly is; but what’s to prevent revolvers being
made with the same sort of grip ? Anyhow, I’d
choose a rubber catapult in preference to an auto,
for serious business any day.
* * * *
“Mulga”: In Western Queensland, where
small timber is prevalent, round posts monopolise
the fencing business. The best representatives are
mulga, myall and box, and there is no doubt about
their lasting qualities, as landholders can all show
fences of from 25 to 50 years’ standing. In the
middle and coastal areas, where the timber is larger,
split posts prevail, preference being shown to iron-
bark, spotted gum and cypress pine. There, also,
owners can show references to be proud of. Both
round and split posts have their advocates, but
writer prefers the former on the grounds that the
toiler has only an axe to carry, whereas, with
the other, there is an additional hump of a saw,
maul and wedges. Also, a Split post means sinking
a larger hole. Sandalwood is undoubtedly the best
lasting wood in Bananaiarid, but, unfortunately, it
grows too small for fencing purposes.
AMERICAN WARFARE.
VOICE IN THE CROAWD: “Look out, mate, he’s going ter dror his fountain-pen and write
yer a Note!”
A REMEMBRANCE.
WIFE : “A man is soon forgotten after he is dead."
HUSBAND : “Not if you marry Ms widow."
“Zipre”: Travelling in . Ireland recently I
spent a few days with my friend Major . AVhile
on a walk we met a boy driving five sheep followed
by Mick with about three feet of whisky inside.
“Hello, Mick,” says the Major. “Where have you
been?” “AVell, now, they told me there was a fair
down in Ballybunyan, so I thought I’d sell some
of my sheep. So I tuk down two. When 1 got
down I found the markit was agin me; so 1 pre-
tended to be a buyer instead of a seller. An’ l
bought three sheep, thinkin’ I’d turn the market.
An’ here I am, landin’ home with the whole * —
flock of five.”
“Reader”: When the stranger found him
lie was drunk-asleep in the dray, the horse standing
at a gate. The stranger took the horse out of the
harness and let him go, and rolled the drunk under
tlie dray. Coming to himself in the morning the
boiled owl looked round and said: “Well, if my
name’s Cronin 1 lost a horse. If it’s not Cronin I
found a dhray.”
“Itan”: The Northern Territory conceals
many strange characters. One of the queerest is
“Mad Paddy,” whose god is the horse. Paddy has
lived in the wilds as long as the oldest hands can
recollect. He holds no country—just wanders over
the landscape with his mob of horses. Some say he
sells a few occasionally, but the statement is not
authentic. Any animal which chances in his way
joins the mob. If the recruit has a clean skin no
claimant has any hope of recovery. Once he got
hold of a well-known blood horse which had been
turned adrift with the station mob—-there are no
i'ences there. When Paddy was asked to supply
details he said the horse must have joined the
mob when he wasn’t looking. Paddy has no particu-
lar home. He drops in at certain isolated depots
where he stores flour and a few other things in
hollow trees, but the open bush is his chief camping
place. He cadges white-man’s tucker wherever he
can, and when he can’t he banquets on wild fowl and
gohannas. But the- old hatter is getting feeble
these times, and some day an overlander will find
a corpse and a fine mob of horses grazing near by.
“E.L.T.”: “Alamon” states he has never
seen a pure black cockatoo. Well, if he takes a
stroll along the Alice River, Barealdine (Q.)> * ie
will find the male bird all black in seven cases out
of ten.
* * * *
“Cheetah” : The other day when the local
noxious-weeds inspector walked into a pub at AVan-
garatta (Vic.) he found blooms of the “Paterson
curse” filling the epergnes in the dining-room. These
had been brought in by a farmer, and pursuing him
the inspector found a fine patch of the dangerous
pest. The beauty of the blooms was the excuse of
the innocent cocky, as it was in the case of the
dreaded St. John’s wool pest, which made its appear-
ance at Bright, further up the Ovens River, where
it was introduced as a pot-plant by an old lad}'.
Another curse is reported by the name of “Stinking
Roger.” According to the Cape Times (17/9/’l5)
its pet habit is tainting mutton raised in its vicinity.
■» * * *
“Try Fluke” : Be water-bags, aboriginal
make. The Maoriland coastwise kind, invented five
or six hundred years ago, is the split bull-kelp sun-
dried and frapped with flax. The Canterbury Plains,
as old Tommy ICereene, of Kaiapoi, tells me, were
once called “Nga-Pakihi-AVliakatekateka a AVaitaha,”
a sweet thing in names, which means “The Decep-
tive Plains of the AVaitaha Tribe,” because of the
long and weary distances which John Maori had to
trudge through the tussock from river to river. .It
was a long way between drinks, so the tattooed
abo. had to invent some kind of water-bottle for the
trans-pakihi tramps. The same kind of vessel is
used by the natives around Foveaux Strait and on
Stewart Island for potting the mutton-bird —so-called
because it doesn’t taste like mutton a bit; it is
more fishy than meaty.
* * * *
“Silas Snell”: About 15 months ago a
man disappeared from the vicinity of Yaekandandah
(Vic.). He had a small “cultivation” of 100 acres,
and his name was (say) Peebles. He had no rela-
tives, and the few household things he possessed,
along with 12 hens in a crate, he piled on a dray
sorely afflicted with rickets, and drawn by a grey
horse, a victim to ringbone and lumbago, and
departed, beating the horse with a paling, and giving
forth all the symptoms of an old man in a hurry. AVhen
three months had passed, and nothing was heard of
Peebles and his deplorable horse, inquiries were set
afoot, and the police were spoken to. Nothing
resulted from whatever investigations were made,
however, and the case of the missing Peebles became
a matter of only cursory interest up till quite
recently. Early this month a party from Melbourne
out gunning in the mountains in charge of a local
guide came upon the bones of a horse and near them
a small hen-run in front of a cave in a very wild
sweep of wooded range. AVhile they were discussing
these unexpected symptoms of civilisation a hairy
man came fearfully from the cave. “I say, Mister,”
he said, “how’s the war?” “Still going strong,” a
visitor replied. “The Germans are not nearly
licked.” “0 Lord!” said the recluse, and fled back.
It is supposed to be Peebles.
“IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED,
LIE, LIE AGAIN.”
CONSTABLE : “But that’s not the yarn you
pitched to me last week.”
PTOMAINE DOSSER: “Hi know, Hi know.
But you didn’t believe wot I toljer lars'
week!”
“Caveat Canis” *. Some of these smart
kelpies that can yard chickens back into their egg-
shells ought to come to town and face city condi-
tions. How hard they are a Port Melbourne pup
could tell. He got his name into both the morning
dailies lately as the result of sniffing round an iron
verandah-post which had become charged with elec-
tricity. Did you ever hear and see an electrified
dog? He was, says the Age, “transformed into a
maddened, howling creature, which, with hair on
end like the bristles of a porcupine, hurtled through
the air and landed in one bound in the centre of the
tram-track. For a few moments he lay there as if
dead. Then he Staggered to his feet, circled round
three times, and ran faster than the most daring
motor-hog until he disappeared from view.” Every
dog has his day, but this fellow got a lifetime in a
lump.
NO MORE WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The world is full right up of war,”
Said Smith. “It’s certain sure
AVhen this tremendous fight is o’er
- There never will be any more.”
Said Brown: “Yes, that’s the cure.
“Of battles, pillage, blood and rape
The world has had its fill ;
It’s long been eager to escape
Its heritage of shark and ape,
And now, I guess, it will.”
“No more,” said Smith, “of horrid war.”
Brown shook his solemn pate.
“You’re right, old man,” he said. “No more ;
Instead of shedding human gore
The world will arbitrate.”
“No, that it won’t!” Smith rose irate—•
“The Powers their might will pool,
Imposing peace on every State.”
“You’re wrong,” said Brown; “they’ll arbi-
trate.”
Quoth Smith: “Don’t be a fool!”
“And don’t you be an ass!” said Brown.
“You mind what you’re about,”
Smith said, and promptly knocked him down.
Then Brown cracked Smith across the crown.
And so they fought it out.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“F. 11.” : This country is apparently about
to follow the example of the U.S.A. and
adopt peanut-nibbling as a habit. A few
years ago the TJ.S. peanut-trade was poor;
to-day the wholesaler goes to his day’s toil
in a motor-car. Even now the large Aus-
tralian grocer is telling of how even Toorak
takes its peanuts with the weekly order.
Most of our peanuts are imported. The
good gold which pays for them goes to the
U.S. and that country draws the interest
thereon for ever. Wherefore our seven
Governments should look seriously at the
absurd little vegetable and find out, once and
for all, what areas are most suitable for
growing it; and meantime, peanuts being
merely a luxury, all said and done, it won’t
hurt Australia if Frank Tudor’s friends in
Parliament bung on a duty that will make
the U.S. sit up and yell “Robber !” Peanut-
handling is a neat, tidy, if somewhat humor-
ous business, and the profits are immense,
for somebody. But what Australia knows
about the cultivation of the small beast
needs bringing together and organising.
Metters, the man who founded the big co.
which makes the good Australian stoves and
windmills, tiring of that life, some few years
ago started out as an orchardist in a very
big way on the lower Murray, with peanuts
as a sideline, and his peanut calculations
made his friends’ heads dizzy. But appar-
ently Metters didn’t have enough informa-
tion about peanut-farming, for you don’t
hear a whisper concerning it now in S. Aus.
“J. 0.8.” : He has a business agency now.
It needs no capital to speak of. He peddles
lolly-shops, pubs and fish-and-chip foun-
dries ; he also finances buyers if they can
pay a deposit—say half down and a p.n.
for the balance at 10 per cent. The notes
gee paid when the business, mixed or plain
take-down, changes hands again. This is
generally inside three months. When you
allow for commission, this is a pretty good
thing. His pub was funny, though. It
taught him the game. He came into some
money, chucked his job in the city, and the
agent showed him round the country town.
Everything was all right—trade good in
both beer and spirits ; books a model; brew-
ery figures satisfactory; house well fur-
nished ; decent class of custom and a dashed
smart girl in the bar. So he paid his money
and entered. On the third day he had just
drawn a pint for the brewery drayman and
was about to have one with him when a
frowsy-looking cove came into file bar and
asked for the boss, lie had the cart outside,
he said, and had “come for the stuff.” Then
it turned out that the previous licensee used
to supply another house with five barrels a
week. That is one way of making trade
look good.
* * * *
“Uloola”: The shipbuilding industry is
getting a lift, in a small way, from the con-
tractors for the big dam at Burrinjuck
(N.S.W.). The other day, on the shores of
Australia’s newest lake, the keel was laid
of a 40ft. oil-driven towing launch. The
timber was partially prepared in Sydney
before being railed to the dam, and the crait.
is to be launched within 10 weeks. The
builders are Fisher, Warren and Fisher, of
Balmain. The job of the tug will be to
tow punts of sand from a spot on the lake
21 miles distant to the concrete-mixing
plant at the wall, pulling some 160 tons per
trip.
* * * *
So far the war hasn’t done much damage
to Henry Jones. Not very many years ago
that energetic jam-boiler joined with his
friend Ach. Palfreyman, a Baptist parson’s
son, to buy a disused factory at Hobart.
They had only a few hundred pounds; but
Jcnes had the skill and Palfreyman had the
imagination, and between them they built
up a vast business, and presently, with
some help, they amalgamated very nearly all
the big jam-making concerns in the Eastern
States into Henry Jones Co-operative, Ltd.
The factory at Hobart is, however, still
easily the biggest of the lot; and already
2,000,0001 b. of its output has gone into
khaki, and now the British Government
has sent an order for 5,700,0001 b. more.
“Verdad” concerning railways in S.
America: —
Railway construction in South America is usually
carried out by contract with wealthy English firms:
In some of the Republics the firms by one method
and another contrive to get themselves paid (say) six
per cent, on all capital expended, no limit being set
by the Government to such expenditure. The natural
result is that railway construction costs twice as
much as it ought to. Many of the contractors have
made fortunes, and others besides contractors have
done pretty well, too. The burden comes finally on
the unfortunate country that guarantees the interest,
and thus freights are generally much higher than
would be necessary if the lines were economically
built. I have known a section-house on a railway to
cost £5OO, while similar houses were being built in
the same country for less than £l5O. Sometimes
the line will make a detour so as to get into a hill
for the benefit of the poor contractor. The gauges
are various. The Antofagasta-Bolivia railway has a
2t't. fiin. gauge. The Bolivian railway, which is
owned by practically the same co., uses the metre
gauge (3t't. 3§in.). Part of their lines is laid with
three rails, giving both gauges. The Chilean State
railways are sft. Cin. gauge. The chief Argentine
railways have the same, or very nearly the same,
gauge; but the Entre Rios (Between Rivers) and
the Uruguayan Railways are 4ft. BJin. The Chilean
Longitudinal railway is one metre. It has been
built for strategical purposes, and runs from central
Chile to the north of the country. The more recent
railways in Bolivia and Northern Chile use steel
sleepers—mostly made by ICrupps. On the Potosi
line some double-ended locomotives are used —really
two engines supplied, with steam from a central
boiler. Most long-distance trains carry sleeping and
dining ears.
“Worried” sends along particulars : —-
“Quidam” and “Fruitgrower” are right. Whether
it is because we don’t organise I have yet to find
out, but the fact remains that we cannot get the
prices U.S.A. growers of fruit command or any-
thing like them. In N. S. Wales the papers will
quote for oranges 10s. to 12s. for good and 7s. to
9s. for medium. When the returns come in—well,
you’re liable to get a document like the enclosed,
which shows that four eases realised 2s. per case.
The agent took 4s. for commission, the carter 6d.
and freight called for another 6d. Revenue, Bs. ;
expenditure, ss. ; yield to me, the grower, 3s. Yet
when the city youngster gets an orange someone pays
2d. for it.

If science has its way the lodger of the
future may have a vegetable garden on his
window-sill; and there may be ’^ se^o £
putes between Smith and Brown becai .
Smith’s allegation that Brown has c P f
the roof during the night and stolen o e o_
his best pumpkins. Professor W. B. b
tomley, of England, has a
food in bacterised peat, and the Biitish
eminent has subsidised investigations.
These, carried out at King s College, E
resulted in fine potatoes bang g n( j
eight weeks in a box filled with moss ana
watered once a week with the peat extiaet.
Also, it is alleged that 161 b. of toma ;>
have been taken from one plant, ana
cucumbers obtained from 18 plants ,
days’ growth. It is claimed that, treatei
with this bacterised peat, things may _
made to grow anywhere. So the CoUmg
wood landlady may yet hold out as an a ,
convenience for which she charges no . •
sixpence a week extra the cabbages growing
under the bed, and the heavily-laden mul
berry bush decorating the washstand.
* * * *
“Enzedder” : I have been much struck, on
coming home to Australia and Maoriland
after some years’ absence, by the great lac
of labor-saving appliances. We are more
backward in this respect than many coun-
tries which have cheaper labor and there-
fore less necessity for such machineiy. 11
example. The Wellington-Hutt (J 1.8.)
road and railway, about seven miles long,
cost £109,000 to straighten and re-make.
Parts and wheelbarrows were largely used
to carry the stone and earth. Using modern
machinery I should have liked the con-
tract at £70,000. Not a single steam-shovel
was employed ; in fact, I doubt if theie is
one in M.L. Are there many in Australia.
The Sydney wharves supply another ex-
ample : the absence of machinery for hand-
ling cargo brings a gasp to the face of any
man who has spent his life, as I have, in
watching costs sheets.
“Lamawa”: I hasten to pay entrance-fee
in the Aged Steamer Stakes, and nominate
the Murray, still battling between New-
castle and Sydney, fair or foul. I struck
her first 18 years ago, on the N.S.W. South
('oast, running passengers and cargo to
Moruya, bluff old skipper Canty in the
chair. The steward told me then that he
had been in the boat for 26 years, and that
she’d been on the Maoriland coast for over
30. He may have been a liar, but she
looked all he said.
* * * *
The German flag had not quite vanished
from the high seas in February, according
to a return issued with the authority of
the Argentine Government. This states that,
in that month of this year a steamer under
the murder-stained flag of the Goths landed
51 overseas passengers at Buenos Aires.
Where the lame duck waddled in from is
not stated, nor whether she hoisted the Ger-
man flag after she reached port or before.
DEVIL-BEEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Too much reliance should not be placed on these
periodical reports of a shortage of food in Germany.
—Wise remark by some war-critic.
I rode at large through far Berlin
Upon a white, winged horse,
And heard, remote, a horrid din
That stopped me in my course.
The white stars in the tranquil skies
Like wild eyes seemed to stare,
As through the void the hellish cries
Were wafted on thin air.
And then I heard a scuffling sound
Of poor hot hoofs and yells,
And Something with a wild stag-bound
Arrived with sulphurous smells.
It had two black horns on its head ;
Its hide was scarred with fire;
And in its small eves, deep and red,
Glowed fear and mad desire.
The yells drew nearer. With a snort,
The frightened devil wheeled,
And rushed to starboard and to port
While brother-devils squealed.
Then round the corner with a rush
The driven herd appeared
And halted in a frightened hush,
And backed, and kicked and reared.
Loud whips at once began to crack,
And guttural curses fell
Like verbal lashes on each black
Absurdity from Hell.
Spiked helmets pressed behind the herd,
And instantly it broke ;
As though Old Nick himself had stirred,
It streamed past me like smoke.
And fast upon its flying heels
The Prussian sergeants rode,
Lashing it down, despite its squeals,
The darkened slaughter-road.
Then some Hun cried: “Der Tag draws near!
Moult all your signs of grief!
For we must win, since we have here
Synthetic devil-beef!”

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).

POLITICAL
POINTS
HOLMAN’S POOR RELATION.
The smell from the Holman Government-
Norton Griffiths business grows no less vio-
lent with age. Part of the deal was that
the syndicate or ■ combine should get 5 per
cent, on the salaries paid to the office staff.
Up to the present the combine has put 112
new officials on the State pay-roll, and for
these the suffering taxpayer is finding
£31,000 a year, besides providing screws for
the Works Department which was already in
existence. The annual rake-off for the joint-
stock philanthropists is £1550 on this side-
line alone. Also Norton Griffiths and Co. were
going to provide the cash for carrying on the
works, and thus relieve Holman of the
job of facing Cohen. But as: Holman is
frantically trying to get into Cohen’s lair
for a bigger wad than ever, there is much
mystery and great uncertainty—except about
the bill for commission and the pay for a
double-barrelled Works Department.
The High Court did Australia another
good service last week when it declined to
allow’ one W. B. Wilkinson to be made a
bankrupt. The ground of the application
was that Wilkinson had not paid a “com-
mission” which was said to have been earned
by two members of the N. S. AVales Assem-
bly. The case was the old one of the
Boorabil lands, which have been already in
front of numerous courts and Judges.
The sheep-run, out beyond AVyalong, was
under consideration for closer-settlement
purposes, and Wilkinson wanted badly to
earn a commission on the sale. But the
deal stuck, and then Jones and Osborne,
M’s.L.A.. were offered £250 to help drive the
bargain through the Assembly, of which they
were members. Really the most deplorable
feature of the business is that the whole
atmosphere of N. S. AA’ales politics is so
sordid that Jones and Osborne believed they
were doing nothing which would make a
smell distinguishable from the ordinary
smell of the place. Fortunately the High
Court lives in a different atmosphere, and
for once Griffith, C.J.. and Isaacs, J., could
agree to use the same kind of blistering lan-
guage about the same thing.
“STORMING THE HEIGHTS .”
The God of Booze is having a warm time of
it these days!
“G.J.H.”: The border village where I
chase a crust is on the Victorian side of
the river and provides an excellent example
of the State Rights madness. A large por-
tion of the population (mainly. young men
of military age) adjourns every Sunday to
the N. S. Wales side of the stream, where
there isn’t a town for 45 miles, and in full
view and almost within speaking distance
of the Victorian police station conducts a
flourishing two-up school. The playing of
two-up is an offence in both States, but
the Victorian police cannot interefere in
their neighbor’s back yard, and the N. S.
AVales police are too far aw;ay to do any-
thing. Yet there are some silly people who
still oppose Unification !
“Happy” Jack Scaddan sits dangling his
legs in the grave these times watching the
Westralian deficit stir uneasily below. John-
ston, whose vote saved the Ministry’s bacon
the' other day, now announces that he will
smite the Government with an emphatic
“No” at the first opportunity ; and as the
hilarious John can’t command a majority
elsewhere, it looks as if the interment will at
least take place before the war stops. The
awful mess he lias made for someone to clean
up ought, anyhow, to appeal to Scaddan’s
sense of humor with sufficient force to rob
the obsequies of gloom.
“Verdad,” just back home':—
Here is a point about conscription worth consider-
ing.' I have discussed the war with many South
Americans, and a question often put to me over
there, at the beginning’ of the trouble, was: “Do
you think your English mercenary army will be
able to, stand up against Germany’s national army?”
Note that “mercenary” is used instead of “volun-
tary,” and “national” instead of “conscript” ? The
question was not asked in a nasty spirit, but was the
natural query of any democratic South American.
It iiidicates a point of view quite at variance with
the pleas held by anti-conscriptionists. It seems as
though we wer§ rather behind these:South American
Republics in our conception of democracy,
Melbourne’s Socialists, together with the
I.WAV., the Women’s Peace Army, and other
cranks have struck" the brilliant idea of
organising a 48-hour strike as a protest
against the proposal for universal defence
service. The notion that the idling of a
few hundred persons for a couple of days is
going to affect the policy of the whole Com-
monwealth is distinctly humorous; but why
cease from work only? Why not strike
against taking food and drink? A 48-hour
or 48-day strike against feeding or resting
oneself would be a sweet novelty that would
compel attention. Also it would be really
and truly a personal strike, and wouldn’t be
felt chiefly by the striker’s wife and children.
From the operation of the Education Act
just passed in South Aus. the Adelaide
School of Mines is expressly left out —-which
means that it does not come under Govern-
ment control. The amendment was made by
the Leg. Council just at the end of the
session, and the Assembly would not imperil
the whole Bill by fighting the point, though
it called the alteration “most regrettable, ’
“a serious flaw,” and a “bitter pill.” The
School of Mines is a strong institution
which in technical education runs on parallel
lines with the University; in electrical en-
gineering and such things the two combine.
Langdon Bonytlion, of the Advertiser, is
president, and John Terran in the Assembly
alluded to him like this : —-
The Adelaide School of Mines had been left out
to glorify one man, which was a serious thing. He
could understand a certain man in King William-
street that night laughing- up his sleeve with great
jov becaues he had beaten Parliament and defeated
the will of this honorable House.
At least, that is how the Adelaide Register
reported it. The Advertiser modestly left
out the little man “in King William-street.”
J. C. Watson has had a week or so in Tas-
mania, but he has not put anyone much
wiser as to what is to be done with
returned soldiers. He talked in a
large general way about settling
them on the land, but did not come
down to dots about the method of
getting the land or of giving the
soldiers a start. Apparently the hat
is to be relied on for the land or
some of it and for pocket money
for the soldiers, and the rest is to
be borrowed. Watson spoke with
enthusiasm of the offer of Manifold,
M.H.R., to give 3000 acres of Rich-
mond River land for soldier-settlers,
and suggested that big landowners
would soon be tumbling over one
another to do likewise. If so, it will
be the same untidy old thing that
the voluntary system always is. The
man who is already making the best
use of his land will hand a bit over,
and the worst citizen, who is
greedily hanging on for a rise, will
give nothing at all. The right plan
is to let the former person off altogether, if
he wants to be let off, and hit un the other
one. A land-values tax will do that; and
nothing else will.
Decently Customs Minister Tudor has
been to Geelong and confirmed a Bulletin
story that the local freezing works,
owned by the Harbor Trust and
leased to a carcase-exporting firm, sold
meat all last season, wholesale and
retail, at from 2d. to 4jd. for beef,
3d. for mutton, and 37 d. to 4d. for lamb,
while Melbourne was being dragooned into
paying about three times and is still paying
twice as much. Tudor has information that
the same thing occurred at privately-owned
works in N. S. AVales and Queensland, and
he wants to know why it shouldn’t occur
at any place where the State or the muni-
cipalities control the abattoirs. A good
many other people would like to know, too.
MATRIMONIAL.
FATHER: “I can't see a single reason for
inviting that fellow Brown.”
DAUGHTER: “Then, Dad, look at me. lam
the single reason!”
Little Friday Hall, Attorney-General of
N. S. Wales by the grace of Crusoe Holman,
is still, in his poverty of ideas, prattling
about the virtues of spending—“l am sure
the reason why N. S. Wales has so much to
give is because so much lias been spent.”
The more you spend, says Davy, the more
you can spend. Wherein the little man is
wrong. The more you spend, the more some-
body else can spend.
FATHER XMAS, 1915.
Tlie Tasmanian Government has decided
to cut the loss on its overseas wheat importa-
tions. With 120,000 bushels still in stock
it knocked the price down from Gs. lid. to
4s. 7d., at which the local millers took the
lot and asked for more. As the Governmnet
paid just about Ss. per bushel for the wheat,
it dropped over £20,000 of the public money
on this little lot, not to mention wluit had
been lost before. But it was a relief to get
the Argentine rubbish off its hands, anyway.
“The Old Soldier”: How do we really
stand in the big Western theatre of war ?
In these days we are justified in doubting
almost any report from the Front or about
the Front, but the maps ought to be all
right—they can’t very well be faked. And
they are full of hope. The German line is
a curve Avhich has its convex side to the
Allies, while the Allied line presents its
concave side to the Germans. Thus, the
Allied line is longer than the German, and
allows room for more men and guns. For
that reason it returns a much heavier con-
vergent fire all along the line to the much
weaker divergent fire of the Germans.
Doubtless it was with this in his mind that
General Gallieni, the French War Minister,
said lately that “our enemies are powerless
to attain the essential object of very war —
the destruction of their adversary’s forces.”
And it may explain also the vigor with
which they are creating diversions elsewhere.
The press censorship accounted for the
long absence of Dvinsk from the cables. For
weeks we heard nothing about Dvinsk,
though it had been said to be essential to the
Germans for winter quarters, and was also
said to be the one place where the Russians
were in a strong position. If the Germans
in Russia had “got to the end of their inva-
sive tether” the capture of Dvinsk was not
likely. If, on the other hand, the Russians
were driven from Dvinsk, all the recent
yarns about their “recovering the initiative”
were not worth a row of pins. For weeks
the Censor kept precious Dvinsk under cover.
Then the fact was allowed to leak out that
Dvinsk was the winter headquarters of the
Germans. They had got there. The Cen-
sor couldn’t stop the Germans from scoring
another notable success, but be prevented
the chuckle-headed slacker in Britain and
elsewhere from knowing how serious the
position really is. The suppression of
Asquith with his feeble compromises, and
the Censor with his stupid concealment of
alarming truths, would be worth about a
million men.
The N.S.W. Trade Commissioner has dis-
covered a dozen or so German-firms carrying-
on business in Japan under native names;
and the chances are that Australia is buying
their wares and giving them to little Jim-
billy for a Christmas box. No trade commis-
sioner could count the number of German
firms that are carrying on business in the
U.S.A. and getting half as much again for
the stuff they export to Australia as they
got when the goods were shipped from Ham-
burg. All the anti-German leagues and
covenants that were ever made or ever can
be made will not stop this traffic. The same
thing is happening in connection with the
metal trade, which Prime Minister Hughes
thinks he has taken out of German hands.
Most men who have had much to do with
the international metal business are fairly
certain that, with possibly one exception, the
great German firms handling copper, lead and
zinc are making more money to-day than
they were before the war. They have merely
extended tlieir operations in the U.S.A.- —-
most of them were there all along—and
Britain is paying them £BO per ton instead of
the old £2O for zinc and £95 for copper
instead of the old £6O.
PROVIDENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Divine Providence, as we firmly believe to-day, has
made us one of the greatest nations on earth, and
we trust its guidance to lead us on in the future.
— Dr. PfciLschif ter, German theologian.
With sword and rifle Providence arranged that we
must go
To scatter pain in many lands and face a ruthless
foe.
Lo, war is war ; our marching hosts, as through the
blood they plod,
Must poison, ravish, burn and slay in the high name
of God.
The Providence that watches o’er our nation bade us
break
All laws, conventions, treaty rights and things of
slighter make.
Wc tore the scraps of paper small and cast them to
the flame
Lest we should miss the loot we sought in God’s
most holy name.
Kind Providence that works for us had taught our
chemists skill
To loose the green destroying gas our foes by stealth
to kill.
The babe upon its mother’s breast with noble zeal
we slew,
And under God’s strong guidance smote the trader’s
peaceful crew.
Blood and more blood ! Our path arranged by Provi-
dence so well
Shrieked with the songs of hatred sung by flying
shard and shell.
Our valiant legions east and west on splendid
slaughter bent,
Though slain in thousands, in God's name their
blood and valor spent.
What’s this? The net is closing round. They wax;
we dwindle sore.
Ho, Providence! Your job is here! Now help us
as before 1
Lo, through the mists of blood they come; the guns
grow cold with shame—■
Peace with defeat? All Hell is loose! The Devil
plays the game.

ROOT PILLS ACCEPTED BY MILITARY
AUTHORITIES.
In the early months of the war 10,000
bottles of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
were offered and accepted by the Military
Authorities for use by the troops in Egypt
and Oallinoli. From letters received, the
gift of these pills was highly appreciated by
the men. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are
just the thing required by the men to keep
their system in order. No other single thing
is so important to the soldier .as the
condition of his digestion, which, if
not working properly, makes him a weakness
instead of a source of strength to the
army.— Advt.

NOTIONS
Of the six events decided on the opening
of the A,J,C, December meeting two were won by
imported animals and three by tho progeny of
importations. And if it was a bad day for the
Australian breeder it was an evening of rejoicing for
lkey, as in every event the favorite wei'n, down with
am appetising thud, and in the two principal events
nags that were only mentioned at the tail end fled
past the post before anything else had time to
arrive. It was a great day for the punter who hap-
pened to get scared by the rain and didn't attend the
massacre.
Lord Nagur (7st. 61b.), who captured the Villiers
Stakes for “Posinatus” Chambers, was a stranger to
Randwick, but has performed fairly well in the
Newcastle district, lie started at 16 to 1, and had
to be desperately ridden over the last furlong.
Luckily for him La Penna, who was next, was not
over-anxious to prolong the argument. On the
previous Saturday Lord Nagar found 9st. too much
of a good thing in the Maitland Handicap, though
during the November meeting thereabouts he got
away with a couple of races. Saturday’s was the
slowest-run Villiers Stakes on record (lmin.
43}sec.), hut the course was fairly dead after two
days wet. Dessert (Downshire-Desert Hose) com-
menced earning her oats by a win in the Nursery.
She still owes somebody something, for owner A. G.
White last year paid £1155 for her. The English-
bred horse Canzone accumulated his first lot of
stake-money in Australia by keeping in front in the
Grandstand Stakes. He galloped generously enough
this time, fighting- out a severe finish with Firm and
Giru. During three seasons’ racing in the Cold
Country this prad started 22 times, and wasn’t first
on every occasion but one.
“Carbine, by Musket —Mersey, foaled in
New Zealand, died at Welbeck Abbey, 1914. The
gift of the Duke of Portland, K.G.” This is the
inscription on a gold-mounted inkstand, fashioned
from a horse’s hoof, lately received by the V.R.C.

A stiff Bill for the suppression of book-
making and betting except through the tote or
Tattersall's has just passed the Tasmanian Parlia-
ment. Under the old law it was necessary to prove
that the person accused made a practice of betting
or gaming before anything could be done to him,
and as the police never seemed able to prove it, sly
bookies have flourished exceedingly. Under the
now law it will be enough to prove that a bet was
made.
Tasmanian totalisator figures for the past
racing year show more betting sobriety. At 130
meetings (10 less than the previous year), £291,772
was put. through the machine —a decrease of £18,360.
War troubles have not punctured the
Westralian turf bubble. For the coming Cup
meeting there are 709 entries, crowding all previous
records out of the back door into the dustbin.
Apparently it was the war; anyway 10
clubs disappeared from the Tasmanian totalisator-list
during the year 1914-1915, because they failed to
hold a meeting, and only two new clubs were regis-
tered.

U.S.A. Futurity Stakes, the biggest
money race on the East side, was won by Thunderer,
an unbeaten colt by Broomstick —Jersey Lightning,
in lmin. 11 sec., a record time for the race when
run the full six furlongs. The gross stake was
23,450d015., of which Thunderer’s owner, 11. P.
Whitney, lifts only 16,590d015.
Tom Morrin, ironmonger and big racing
man, of Auckland (M.L.), who passed out in
Canada, was at one time anxious to purchase Cyllene
for stud work. He was prepared to go to £lO,OOO,
a mighty sultrv figure in those days, but when the
owner asked £lB,OOO Morrin lost his breath. Yet
he got into many worse deals than that might have
turned out. Cyllene subsequently brought £31,000,
and was considered cheap even at that price. He
was an amazing success at the stud, siring four
English Derby winners—Cicero, Minoru, Lemberg,
and Tagalie.

F. H. Pyne, one of the best-known racing-
men in Maoriland, went the way of all horse and
other flesh at Christchurch a couple of weeks ago.
He was : one of the partners in the stock-auctioneer-
ing firm of Pvne and Co., and had run every big
blood-stock sale held in the South Island for 25
years. AVith one of his partners, Alex. Boyle, he
generally had a few nags in training, and won many
races, but it was at the game of eloquently steering-
racehorses. towards new owners that he was best
known. He made a start many years back by get-
ting privately the then big figure of I7oogns. for
Merrie England. For such famous nags as Van-
guard and Lochiel he also found new proprietors. A
few years ; back Pyne handed out G. G. Stead’s collec-
tion'of fleet-footed and breeding prads in exchange
for the handy little sum of .41,815gn5., and did
another fair day’s work when he got rid of J. B.
Reid’s Elderslie stud for 19,025gn5. He took the
Last Bid in the very prime of life.
A man with something of a record behind
him is AY. Clyma, who was on top of the animal
that won the high jump for hacks at Oamaru
(ALL.) Show the other day. He has been a com-
petitor at that show in the jumping contests for 24
consecutive years! At some time or other in that
long struggle he has bagged every pot or prize
offered for horsemanship over the sticks.

What a bargain in horseflesh T. H. Lowry,
of Hawkes Bay (M.L.), got when he purchased
Aurarius (Malster —Aurous) for under 300 guineas!
Her first foal was Crcesus, who was sold without
being tried, but has won races and more than paid
for his oats. The second was Desert Gold, who,
though as yet only at the beginning of her three-
year-old season, has already collected £6715 m
stake-money. The third, Egypt, has also begun
raking in cash, and looks like developing into the
be c t two-year-old in Maoriland this season.

“Pick” : I know of three horse-perform-

hour’s spell on the way. Sambo was off the grass

“Two Seas”: The fragment of Mossy
Isaac biography related by “Y.Z.” (B. 9/12/’l5)
recalls one of old “This-an’-the-Next’s” experiences
known only to a few. Away back in Martini’s year
Mossy was asked for the two Martinis, Derby and
Cup. Mossy laid the stranger 100 to 1, and wrote
out a ticket to that effect. But Mossy got the wager
mixed with another, and entered it in his book as
“Martini-Grand Flaneur.” After Martini romped
home the second time Mossy had a firmly-held ticket
pushed into the shade of his nose with a gentle re-
quest for £lOl. He looked at the number and com-
pared it with his book, smiled a little anxiously and
said: “Id vos Grand Flaneur you back for the Cup,
mine friendt. See, I haf it so in my book, and vud
liaf paid if he had vun. The ticket is wrong. I am
sorry for the mistake.” But the owner of the paste-
board regarded Mossy with cold disfavor. “The mis-
take, as you call it, will cost you £100,” he retorted.
“Pay up, or I’ll get you wiped off the list.” Then
Israel swept the ancient cork helmet to the back of
his head and broke into a torrent of reproaches.
“You vos a d —d svindler. You saw me write Grand
Flaneur in this book und never said a vord. After
Martini vun the Derby, I asked you if you vanted to
lay off on Grand Flaneur —und you never said a vord,
aii’ you”——- “Will you pay?” interrupted an
unmoved client. “No,” shrieked Mossy, whirling
his arms around like a semaphore loose in a gale.
“I’ll see you” “You’ll see me at Byron Moore’s
office,” broke in a calm voice, and Mossy was left
explaining the situation to a group of unsympathetic
backers. When Mossy appeared before the secretary
he started a song-aud-dance illustrative of the dupli-
city of the backer. “Is that your writing on this
ticket?” asked Moore. “Yes,” yelped Mossy, “but”
“Oh, pay, Mr. Isaacs, pay, or take the conse-
quences.” After counting out the hundred and one
lofely qvids the Jew departed in a faint blue haze.
J. SCOBIE, trainer (Vic.).
A few days after I met Mossy in a Bourke-street cafe
enjoying' some pickled cucumbers, and inquired if he
had met his Martini client since. Whereupon tears
welled up into his bulging eyes. “Yes, mine
friendt,” he wailed, “and, vood you believe it. the
[censored] svine told me straig'ht oudt- —told ME—
that if Grand Flaneur had vun the Cup lie vood haf
lost his ticket und claimed the vager on "the evidence
of my book!” For months afterwards mention of a
Martini “double” drove the ancient to wild fury.
It was cruel to lure him on to the story. But we
often did.

Llew Edwards, holder of the Lonsdale
belt, had his first unpleasantness in this part of the
world on Saturday at Sydney Stadium, and belted
seven bells out of Jimmy Hill, the Australian cham-
pion. The stranger is an aggressive performer who
doesn’t look the part. Mild of countenance, with
long, fair hair, a pallid skin, and a fine-drawn
frame almost devoid of muscular development above
the waist line, Edwards was the complete antithesis
of Hill, with his brown, strong body topped by a
hard-looking mug. There is a calm deliberation, too,
about Edwards which the other fellow 7 hasn’t got.
Hill had the best of the opening round, and
swanked to his corner with appropriate confi-
dence. He also wore a satisfied look after the
second. But he didn’t wear it any more. He boxed
well, of course. He always does. But most of it
was ineffective, and the purposeful Edwards went
after him as he leaped .away, and hit him with
gloves that hurt, and kept on doing the same thing.
When Hill went into clinches Edwards didn’t shove
him off. He walloped him off with good hard jabs
under the chin, and then hunted him round the
ring and smote him again. At times Hill sprang off
his tail, so to speak, or off the boards, and went at
his enemy like a tornado; but though these inter-
ludes were spectacular and caused the crowd to cheer
they were mostly wild, purposeless outbreaks with
swinging, open hands, which inflicted no injury.
And throughout it all Hill was getting the father of
a hiding. In the eighth Edwards aimed the right to
what Hill uses to eat with, and had him down for
nine, and before the bell went in the next had
upended him for eight and three. In the tenth Hill
was' on the floor when the gong clanged, and was
holding a. stop-work meeting at the same address at
the end of the eleventh. In the twelfth he was pre-
sented with time-off on two occasions (nine and
eight). In the thirteenth he stopped another which
called for repose while the referee ticked off nine,
and was then spared a further dlout by the fall of
a fluttering towel. He was done to a turn. Edwards
is scheduled to meet Taylor next at Brisbane, and
afterwards will probably be introduced to Simpson
at Melbourne.
Carrying a lot of grit, a worried look, the
movements of a windmill, and a crop of red liair,
Frank Kirvvan lately came out of the West in search
of the bantam championship, lie met .lack Jannese
at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night, and the
quest ended. Standing well on his heels with arms
gyrating at top-speed the Westralian kept Jannese
thinking rapidly through the first six or seven
rounds, and then John took a tumble. At the half-
distance he was ripping heavy lefts to Kirwan's
midriff and frequently crossing him to the jaw by
way of variety. An excess of imports over exports
during the next few rounds put W.A. out of busi-
ness, its schedule being filed in the fifteenth clash
after eight visits to the floor, four of which were
made in the thirteenth. Jannese then thanked him
for a pleasant evening and left.
* * * *
“Eryander”: Les Darcy isn’t the first
Maitland blacksmith to make good in the ring. Frank
Slavin was an iron-smiter from those parts. It’s
odd, by the way, that nobody has ever commented
upon Slavin's strong resemblance to Kitchener. The
square forehead and low-grown hair, the straight,
lowering brow, the small eye, the blunt, indeter-
minate nose, the solid chin; even the shape and
style of moustache —all were part of Paddy. No-
body ever called him Frank when I knew him, in the
late ’Bo’s. Despite his face and his ferocious
punch, Slavin was a real good sort, and very candid.
I remember remarking upon his disappointing draw
with American Jack Burke. “Drop anything?” he
said. “No; nothing on.” “All right; chance a
few bob this time.” I took the hint, and wasn’t so
surprised as some of them when Burke was smashed
up in three rounds.
* * * *
“Sardonyx” : In all tlie figlit-talk of the
day there is never any mention of old-time Bill
Sbarkes, who, after cleaning-up all the local talent,
went to England in ’47, fought the famous Nat
Langham 67 rounds, and was beaten only by a
broken arm. Our man was 13st. to Nat’s 11 —not
too much weight for a comparative novice to receive
from the redoubtable Langham. Quite aware of the
size of his contract, Sparkes was very cautious at
first, and things were a bit slow for a couple
of rounds. Then Nat set suddenly to work, hut he
found the Cornstalk at home, and took half a dozen
real rib-shifters without doing much in return. He
smiled as he came in again, but the smile had vanished
when he rose after being clean up-ended by a smash-
ing right-hander on the ear. The rest was a hurri-
cane. The Australian’s face by the 40th round was
simply cut to pieces, but he had still one eye good,
and lie remained as strong as a horse, whereas
Langham was looking very sick. He had taken a
terrific pounding. He tried hard to get that other
eye—the way he beat Sayers-—but it was no go, and,
as he was getting weaker and weaker, liis friends
thought it was all over, until, when the Australian
came up for the 63rd round, it was seen that his
rigiit arm was out of action. He had broken one
of the bones of the lower-arm. Yet he fought five
more rounds with his left alone before he could be
dragged out of the ring. But for that broken bone
this plucky Cornstalk would no doubt have gone
right through to the championship of England.
» * * *
“C.G.” : Incase “Sardonyx” (B. 9/12/’l5)
should feel inclined to again remark that Boh
Brettle administered the only defeat Jem Mace
suffered, I merely want to observe that the champion-
ship passed from Mace to Tom King on Nov. 26,
1862, after an argument lasting 38 minutes.

“8.J.” : According to London puff-pars,
black brudder Johnson is to finance and “star” in a

role of a colored pugilist, and a life-like impersona-

“Jimmy” Randell is making a decent
splash in Sydney grade cricket this season. In
three matches the Middle Harbor trundler lias
gathered 12 wickets for 181, 11 for 103, and five for
124—28 wickets for 408, an average of 14.57. Ran-
dell in these efforts was merely filling in spare
week-ends before leaving for the Front.
It isn’t, often in grade cricket that a club
team hoists over 500 runs in an afternoon, but the
feat was accomplished at Christchurch (M.L.) on a
recent Saturday. It was a first-grade match between
Riecarton and East ChCli, and Riccarton, going to
the wickets, smote the bowling to every point of
the compass, and had made 511 runs for eight sticks
when time was called. Riccarton ran nine mi les
between the. wickets. East ChCh ran about 139 miles
after the ball.

The “college match” in Adelaide brought
out, in two moderate sides, one possible batsman —
Jose, who made 96 for the losing side, St. Peter’s;
and one certain howler, Plush, who absolutely won
the game for Prince Alfred. He took 9 for 71 and
6 for 20 ; and then, when things looked bad for his
side—so to make, and three wickets to fall—he put
up 34 not out and saw the match won without fur-
ther loss. Both Plush and Jose are juniors of
well-known cricketing families.

“J.D.”: “Adelaide” (B. 16/12/’l5), re
the 1882 cricket test (England v. Aus.), reiterates
that it “was youthfulness that lost England the
match,” and says that he “had the four Cambridge
men in mind—two of them undergrads.” Lyttelton,
Lucas and Steel had played in the 1880 test in
England, and Lucas in a test in Australia in 1879.
As the fourth Cambridge man, Studd (nil, not out),
went in at the fall of the eighth wicket of the
1882 test, and did not receive a ball, where does
the “young” excuse exist ? Maurice Read was
bowled second ball. The real reason England was
beaten is that the team had the worst of a bad
wicket, on which F. R. Spoffortli was performing
(14 for 90).

“G.M.”: “Jackar” (B. 9/12/T5) is gifted
with a lively imagination. Midwinter did not play
in the match against Grace’s team in Bendigo, and
Glen did not bowl. Oscroft was splendidly caught
at square peg by Brennan off Boyle. There was no
question about the catch, and no incident whatever
in the play was the subject of controversy. The
spectacle of “W.G.” rushing on to the field to dis-
pute a decision, and “both” umpires giving Oscroft
out after a quarter of an hour’s argument, is too
absurd. As a matter of fact, Grace did not attend
the luncheon, but his action in this matter did not
arise out of anything which occurred during the game.
* * * *
“Jackar” : Re W. G. Grace and the
Bendigo cricket incident. “Nyren” (B. 16/12/’l5)
asserts that I have given a “modern setting” to a
disturbance between Billy Bruce and Grace. I was
an official on the occasion referred to, and necessarily
I must now be in the sere and yellow leaf —the age
of the doddering idiocy which manifests itself in
applying modern settings to ancient saws. But
“Nyren” doesn’t state that the disturbance between
the two men was not on the point to which I
alluded. However, that is not worth discussing.
“Nyren” affords an opportunity to ask what has
become of the boys of the old Bendigo brigade of
cricketers —Angus Mackay, Glen, Walters and the
then Blackham, Billy Bruce (no relation to Billy
8., the deft Melbourne left-hander). All gone, I’m
afraid, to the place where the curly slows cease
from troubling and the wicket is at rest —all, per-
haps, except Bruce, I saw him a while ago, when he
looked as young as ever, although almost as iotund
as one of his beer-barrels. ,
Alf Grenda’s wm (with F. Hill, of
U.S.A.) in the N’York eight-days’ bike race, lifts tne
Tasmanian mi with other Australians A.
and a. T. Uoullett, who also shared the cash of two
wins in this event. In the last seven races Aus-
tralian pedallers have been in the final rush m
—which is something for those who enthuse oter
legs and varicose veins to cheer about. tune w
when big Alf Grenda’s claim to top-notch cycling was
ridiculed in Australia ; but when he began to use his
head as well as his legs, there was a different tale
to tell. On this season’s American wheeling, Gienaa
is the speediest Australian, and next to Kramer tne
greatest rider of the world. #
Frank Kramer, who bagged the planet s
bike-pushing premiership again the other day, first
did it when he was 20, and has done it altogether to
times since. He is 35 this month and talks ot cele-
brating the event by retiring.

“Quidam” : The time is ripe for the inven-
tion of a machine which will automatically record
brilliant thoughts evolved while punching a pedal
bike on lonely roads in the country. 1 observe that
one’s brain seems to be exceptionally active on such
occasions, and the absence of means to record the
results without stopping causes great loss to the
world. Tlie effect of a motor-bike appears to be the
opposite. Possibly the enhanced heart-action conse-
quent on punching the pedal vehicle, in contrast
with the physical inactivity but increased nervous
strain inherent in the quicker-moving machine, is
responsible for the difference. The former effect is
equivalent to that of alcohol, which often makes the
dullest brain evolve sparkling ideas. This accounts
for the interesting nature of the conversation of total
abstainers from water as against that of teeto-
tallers.

E. G. Baker, a Yankee motor-cyclist now
in Sydney, proposes cleaning up the Australian
records. But there are some tall stumps to bump
against, chief of which arc J. Bolger’s 23hr. 41min.
between Sydney and Melbourne, and C. W, Kornev’s
world’s 24-hour record of 8714 miles. When Baker
has had a day’s jog on some of the Australian roads
he may think it worth while to take a pull and
smash things in a more leisurely way.
* * * *
Melbourne-Sydney motor-car record was
almost shattered the other day. Boyd Edkins, carry-
ing what purported to be a military despatch between
the State capitals, drove a 16-20h.p. Vauxhall in
such a hurry that he was more than two hours ahead
of the record at Goulbum (N.S.W.). But rain
tumbled on him then, and the Razorbaclt being im-
passable the record he was making fell by the way-
side. The figures for the distance belong to Sydney
motorist A. V. Turner (19hr. 2min.). Edkins how
climbs up alongside Napoleon. A few hours’ snow-
storm knocked Nap. out; two inches of rain upset
Edkins.

Lieutenant Frank de Beanrepaire, who
lately forsook his steady job as Victoria’s State
swimming-instructor to go for a soldier, and was
presently hit by appendicitis, is once more in uni-
form. ' The other day, at the Maribyrnong water-
carnival, he did a fast half-mile to remind people
that he had once been Victoria’s amateur swimming-
champion ; and at present he is a co-agitator with
the evergreen Les Bruford on behalf of a Gallipoli-
huts fund. To this end they are stage-managing a
military marathon from Broadmeadows to the M. 0.0.
ground.

There is a swimming-club for women at
Albert Park, and another at Brighton. (Vic.).
Brighton has decided, after an interesting discussion,
to continue excluding’ mere men from all swinmrng
carnivals ; but Albert Park “hopes to make consider-
ably better progress in the. future” by admitting
male spectators. Nowadays, after long agitation,
Albert Park has the right to go mixed-bathing—and
does so in the summer-time, early and often. So
does Brighton—such of old-fashioned, conservative
Brighton as bathes at all. So here is a humorous
position. Miss Brighton will go swimming with her
young men outside the baths; and she will attend
their swimming shows. But only feminine onlookers
may come to the enclosed water-festivity when Miss
Brighton is performing. Even the band comes from
the Blind Asylum! Still, Brighton’s attitude is all
of a piece with that suburb’s mildewed state. of
mind in political matters. It is Brighton which
keeps Snowball, anti-tote enthusiast and “prohibi-
tionist,” in the State Assembly; and it regularly
sends James Boyd to the Reps., firmly believing that
James is a respectable British matron.
“One for his Nob”: The Tas. Supreme
Court has decided that the . good old. game of ci’ib-
bage is not a game of chance within the meaning
of the Act. A country pubkeeper was. charged with
allowing a game of cards — to wit, cribbage—to be
played in a room off his bar, and on appeal the case
turned on the point whether cribbage was a game of
chance, and therefore prohibited, or a game of skill,
and therefore permissible. The Court held that
when the Act said “a game of chance” it meant
chance and not skill, or even skill into which some
element of chance entered. Of the three judges who
carhe to this weighty decision one, Justice Ewing,
asserted that he had never played a hand of cards in
his life, while the others blushed to admit that they
had occasionally had a flutter at patience or old
maid.


A Knowledge of Scientific Boxing
*
*
Makes it Easy to Win
Because it places you at such a great advantage.
The scientific Boxer has passed the “hit or miss” stage, and
fully recognises that coolness is necessary to ensure victory. He
knows how to reserve his strength, and how to sicle-step the wild
rushes of his wild, excited, frenzied-tempered opponent.
The Science has made him cool, calm and collected. He is
constantly drawing his opponent into position; puts the weight
of his body behind his blows; plants his punches where they are
most felt; confuses and bewilders his opponent by evading and
countering his attempts to “land.”
The Scientific Boxer is master of his movements. His muscles
are lithe and elastic. He can hit from any position without
difficulty.
I Teach Boxing* by Post.
The instruction is practical, simple and easily
understood. It thoroughly explains and illustrates
every serviceable move in Scientific Boxing.
You now have the opportunity of cultivating your
natural ability, of making good use of the means
which Nature gave you for protecting yourself.
No pastime is on the same level as boxing for
genuine enjoyment. Why deny yourself such pleasure
and such a useful knowledge when it’s easily within
your reach and means?

So in five years liabilities have been reduced
by £83.957 ai d assets by £79,393, and there
are still £295.903 of assets to pay £96,308
oi debt. The creditors have therefore noth-
ing to worry about. As for shareholders,
nominally there is £231,490 of capital; and
there is on paper a surplus of £199,655 of
assets. But the question is, What will
those assets bring? This may be some
guide:—
In 15 years £249,739 assets paid £217,672 debt.
In 5 years 79,393 assets paid 83,957 debt.
In 1 year 11,1.68 assets paid 13,243 debt.
That shows a far better result in the more
recent than in the earlier years, and gives
hope that the book value of the assets will
be realised. On recent figures it ought to
be considerably more than realised. _ But a
higher rate of interest is being paid now
(though certainly it is still only 31 p.c.).
I'urther, the co. is pledged to pay off the
deposits by 10 annual instalments; and it
is possible that, as events have turned out,
this may be inconvenient presently. How-
ever, things are far from being as bad as
they once threatened to be. No dividend is
of course being paid, nor has any been paid
since—well, it would be unkind to say.
* * * *
Adding the interim paid in July by the
Sulphide Corporation to the dividend of 2s.
on prefs. and 2s. 3d. on ordinary shares
now declared, the total is equal to 20 p.c. for
12 months to .Tune 30. This takes £192,500.
Prefs. are paid to 20s. and ordinaries to
15s., so 20 p.c. = -is. and 3s. respectively.
The other 5s. on ordinaries was written off
to provide for some of the losses made in
the attempt to work the Ashcroft patent

In quitting Mungana (Q-) to take charge
of Mouramba Mines, Nymagee (N.S.W.),
manager Rodda will find that he still has a
tough proposition. With high-grade . ore,
moderate wage-rates and low road-freights,
Nymagee was fairly successful; but present
conditions being all the reverse of these, it
is only an abnormal copper market that
will give any profit. What Nymagee wants
is connection by rail with the Cobar line, say,
at Hermidale. When the Longworths owned
the mine they made a proposal to the Gov-
ernment that if the latter supplied old rails
they would construct a line according to de-
partmental specifications. This genuine pro-
posal was turned down at the instance of the
Labor party, on the ground that if the line
were worth constructing it should be laid down
and controlled wholly . by.Che Government.
Three or four years ago the Government was
induced to propose to construct the line, and
I he owners of the mine lodged £S000 in cash
as a guarantee of interest on the cost, of
construction for a certain term. This time
the Leg. Council rejected the proposal on the
ground that it was purely an undertaking
for private enterprise. The next time that
the co. submits the proposal it might do well
to invoke the assistance of some other than
railway “engineers.” . -V

“Veritas” : The news (B. 2/12/T5) that Mr.
Pittman is about to leave off being Under-
Sec. of Mines in N. S. W.ajes is welcomed
by the fossicking class of miners. He is
honorable, conscientious and energetic, but
he bristles with impracticable fads and
theories that have driven fossickers off the
fields. And that is the class that does most
of the prospecting work. The future .of the
industry depends on who shall be his suc-
cessor' ' There are two qualified men in the
Department—Ray and Inspector Milne, the
latter the more suitable, for as senior In-
spector of Mines he has had years of prac-
tical experience. Under his regime I am
sure our dormant fields would flourish. But
metalliferous mining should be a separate
• department from coal and shale, the. condi-
tions of working being so widely different
that administration by one head (who can-
not be an expert in both) is bound to be
unsatisfactory.
* * * *
A big mining case involving possibly over
a million sterling is now before the London
courts. The litigants are the Amalgamated
Properties and the Globe and Phoenix Co.,
Rhodesia, and the bone of contention is
extra-lateral rights. These rights were
enacted into national law by the U.S.A. in
the very month and year that Victoria aban-
doned them for the straightforward system
of confining rights within the vertical ex-
tensions of the claim lines, and the statute
has proved a gold-mine to American lawyers
ever since. The system never srot a look in
on the Rand field, where the Australian sys-
tem has always been firmly established; but
in Rhodesia the introduction of. the princi-
ple was brought about by the influence ol
Yankee mining engineers. So far, there has
not been very much litigation over it there,
but the lawyers are now about to make up
for lost time. # »

“Kodak" snaps the suburban tragedy:—
I shall never forget (he afternoon Mrs. Walrus
tried to leave her husband far ever and failed.
Walrus was a gentle-mannered man with sad eyes
who clerked for a living and killed his spare time
at the bowling-green. llis wife was a handsome,
high-spirited dame with ambitions —the sort that
couldn’t possibly be satisfied by a Walrus, 1 used
to play. with the small son in their backyard, and
one afternoon we became aware of a tragic proces-
sion of two passing silently towards the back gate.
It was Mrs. Walrus, with her chin in the air and
her fine eyes flashing Are, leaving Walrus’s roof for
ever. A scared little daughter attended her. Both
were in full calling regimentals, but without lug-
gage of any sort. After the procession had passed
out of the yard, we resumed our game of marbles
and thought rip more about it. Within five minutes
Mrs. 'Walrus and her daughter swept back again and
went into the house —presumably to add a postscript
to-the last farewell. If poor Walrus made any reply
we didn’t hear it; we only, knew that diplomatic re-
lations had been broken off for the second time when
Mrs. Walrus and daughter, silent and tragic as
before, passed us again outward bound. The back
gate slammed heavily after them and they were
g. one —for quite 10 minutes. After the first half-
hour of departures and returns we did not trouble
to interrupt our game; we were merely aware of
the tragedy going on behind our bent backs. About
the time" it was getting too dark to see, the little
daughter suddenly burst into tearful lamentations.
Her boots were hurting her, she said, and she
wanted a drink of water and when would tea be
ready? After that Mrs. Walrus herself wept a little
in a ladylike way and took her hat off. She also
removed her proud Spanish manner. Ihe tea-call
made the welkin ring at the usual time that night,
and as 1 climbed the fence for home I saw the
reunited Walrus family gathered round the gaslit
evening meal. Mrs. Walrus wore the radiant look
of a high-spirited woman who has had a thoroughly
satisfactory emotional drunk. Poor Mr. M alrus.
with his sad, ringed eyes, looked much the same as
usual. I fancy he had to weather the same old
storm about four times every year.
Another of these Capitalists is off to the
war to protect his Australian property. This
time it is young Maurice Kozminsky,. who
lately emerged from his sergeant’s uniform
and took on the full panoply of a second-
lieutenant. Young Kozminsky is a son of
hat-builder Kozminsky, of the Austral Mills,
and a co-director of the concern, which also
permits Premier Peacock to. fill a chair at
its Board meetings.
I palled you a fool
Years ago, do you mind?
A scribe of your school,
I called you a fool.

Was it cruel to be kind?
I called you a fool

In deciding to place HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS on the Australian market I do so with a knowledge,
based on an experience of over 20 years as a dispensing chemist, that there is no finer combination of
nutritive, tonic and medicinal preparations procurable.
HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS, though not previously advertised, have been used with such good
results by many people prominent in social, professional, commercial and industrial life, that they have not
hesitated to grant permission to publish their letters of gratitude and commendation. Most of those whose
letters are given below are known and trusted throughout the length and breadth of Australia because of their

business capability and integrity. For that reason, their experiences, told in their own way, will go farther towards satisfying the public as to
the effectiveness of HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS than anything else that might be written concerning them,
Muscular Rheumatism Disappeared.
Mr. 0. BLANDFORD WRIGHT, of Wright, Heaton
and Co., Ltd., the premier firm of forwarding and
shipping agents in the Commonwealth, writes: —•
Having suffered on and off for some years from
muscular rheumatism, I was advised recently to try
your Tonic Nerve Nuts, with the result that not only
have all signs of the rheumatism disappeared, but
my general health has greatly benefited. I can con-
fidently recommend the use of Ilean’s Tonic Nerve
Nuts to anyone suffering from a complaint similar
to mine.
A Martyr to Severe Headaches.
Mr. H. WHITE, Manager of the Sims Piano Dep6t,
21 Park Street, Sydney, writes:—
I have been a martyr to severe headaches for many
years now, and have tried many remedies without
securing lasting relief. Since using Hean’s Tonic
Nerve Nuts, however, my headaches have become as
scarce as they used to be frequent. It gives me great
pleasure to write this note, so that others similarly-
afflicted to myself may gain the benefit of my ex-
perience, and so save themselves much needless
suffering.
Valuable for Brain Workers.
Mr. CIIAS. STANFORD, proprietor of the World’s
Biograph and Film Supply Co., 110 Bathurst Street,
Svdney, writes: —•
" After having taken several remedies for nervous-
ness I have no hesitation in saying Hean’s Tonic
Nerve Nuts have proved most valuable to me. _ My
work at times is most arduous, but with the aid of
Nerve Nuts I am now enabled to go through stren-
uous days of work with a remarkable freedom from
mental fatigue.
Jack Cannot’s Experience.
jACIv CANNOT, rairth-maker-in-chief of the Tivoli
Follies, and the idol of all Australian vaudeville
patrons, writes: —
Feeling run down and tired with the work
entailed in the new production of the Tivoli Follies,
I decided on taking a course of Hean’s Tonic Nerve
Nuts. The effect on my nerves and system generally
has been wonderful. I feel better, and am able
to put more life into my work than I had done
MR. JACK CANNOT.
for some time past. I shall certainly recommend
Hean’s Tonic Nerve Nuts to my friends in the
theatrical profession.
Recommended by Les Darcy.
Hr. LES DARCY, the middle-weight champion of
the world, writes: Feeling depressed after my hard-
est training, I was recommended by. a friend to try
yoiir Tonic Nerve Nuts. Their effect was excellent.
I must say I feel real fit again, and I advise anyone
going in for training to use Ilean’s Tonic Nerve Nuts.
A Great Steadier of Nerves.
Mr. ARTHUR EGAN, stage manager for Philip
Lvtton’s Touring Company, says: My business often
compels me to devote a great deal of time to deep
study. Latterly I have been using liean’s Tonic
Nerve Nuts for the inevitable brain fag which long
hours of mental work induce, and I have no hesita-
tion in saying your preparation has proved a most
valuable tonic and a great steadier of nerves.—Yours
faithfully, ARTHUR EGAN.
Well-known Singer’s Appreciation.
Miss RAY de VERB, the charming young French-
Australian singer, writes: The heavy part which I
am tp take in the Christmas pantomime at the
Adelphi Theatre calls for hard study. t found
myself growing nervy, and headaches were unpleas-
antly frequent. I had derived such satisfaction from
the use of Hean’s Essence for colds and throat
troubles that I decided to try HEAN’S TONIC
NERVE NUTS, believing that you would not dream
of putting any new line on the market that would
be likely to injure the reputation you had won from
the Essence. I am very pleased indeed to be able
to say my opinion was correct, for Hean’s Tonic
Nerve Nuts have suited my case admirably, and I
heartily commend them to anyone who has “nerves”
or is engaged in heavy studies.
The price of Hean’s Tonic Nerve Nuts is 3s. , per
bottle, containing sufficient for ten days’ treatment:
or six bottles for 17s. 3d. They may be obtained
from chemists and stores. Should your local medi-
cine-dealer be unable to supply you, send price, and
you will receive a bottle per return mail from the
manufacturer, G. W. HE AN, Chemist, 178

IN BANANA LAND
Interesting proclamation in the Brisbane
press:—
The Premier announced that, as a result ot' his
interview with the Prime Minister, arrangements had
been made with Mr. Hughes with regard to the
supply of certain funds required by Queensland in
London this month. The amount ( £500,000) is
needed urgently for the purpose of paying interest on
certain loans.
Yet it wasn’t six months ago that various
State politicians professed to be so indignant
at a suggestion that they were borrowing to
pay interest that they almost burst. For-
tunately Ryan can afford to tell the ghastly
truth. The misfortune is that he then pro-
ceeds to do precisely as the other politicians
did who were responsible for the ghastliness.
“Itan”: Ryan is out to nationalise the
fishing business without fear of the Greeks
or the Pharisees. Trawlers (borrowed
cash) are being secured to work the coast,
shops (more borrow) are to be established
in Brisbane suburbs, with delivery carts
(further borrow). Coastal towns to be
served in the same manner (additional bor-
row), and the way-backers are to get smoked
mullet and canned lobster (spot cash) from
the State factory (p.n.). The oyster will
soon be socialised and induced to grow with
greater frequency. In addition to all this,
inland rivers and lakes are to be sown with
spawn in the hope of assisting the back-
ldocker to land a cod and spin yarns about
how big it wasn’t.
More casual Australian! In a Brisbane
infanticide case the other day it was elicited
that the body of the child was fastened to a
plank and thrown over a bridge into the
river. When fished out by the police the
body was still secured to the timber by a
strap on which was printed in ink: “Miss
F. Stephens, Roadvale Station, Fassifern
Line.” Even the Brisbane Holmes Depart-
ment was able to make an arrest on that
clue.
The recount made it look no better.
Fisher’s old seat at Wide Bay is not going
to be represented by a Labor man, E. B. C.
Corser, a Liberal, being 86 ahead on a big
poll when the final numbers went up.
Corser is a huge person 6ft. 2in. long, with
whiskers to match. In the while-ago he
managed the Commercial Bank at Gayndah,
but flung that up and went into business
as a merchant at Maryborough, and, inci-
dentally, into liquidation. But he had the
grit, and nowadays prospers in a wine and
spirit depot. At one time he sat in the
Assembly and worked hard for the local
bridge. His platform has four planks: (1)
Maryborough, (2) Wide Bay, (3) Banana-
land, (4) Australia.
THE HYPOCRITE.
FIRST LADY: “I don’t like that Mrs. Jones! She has a smile for everybody!”
SECOND LADY: “Neither do I Why can't she be natural?"
Parliament has just raised the borrowing
power of Rockhampton Harbor Board to
£400,000, on the ground that the Board
had reached its statutory limit of £300,000
and would fall down dead if it couldn’t
keep on borrowing. The extra £lOO,OOO
is to be thrown after the rest, mostly
to deepen a river that refuses to be
deepened; but the Board has got so
addicted to the habit of dredging up
mud that it couldn’t knock off now without
being _ ill. The only way to separate it
from its mud would be to drag it forcibly
away to Cloncurry.
Hooray—it wasn’t the Kettle, it was the
Pot! Wherefore the Kettle sings :
Dear Bulletin,— You state (B. 2/12/T5) that
one of Labor’s first jobs, when it assumed control,
was to sell off “some permanent and reproductive”
works. The inference drawn here by many readers
is that the successful tenderers got a fat bargain in
the purchase of the Groper dredge. Probably. The
point is that not only were tenders called, but the
sale was effected two or three weeks prior to the
last election (May 22). Hence the deal was made
during the regime of the Conservative or Tory payty.
—-Yours, Geo. P. Barber, Secy. Parliamentary Libor
Party.
But the point wasn’t whether the purchasers
got a bargain or not. It was that a “perma-
nent and reproductive” work costing thou-
sands was sold for hundreds —-which pointed
The Bulletin’s old moral that there are
no such things as “permanent” works, and
that a sinking fund ought therefore to be
attached to every loan, if we must have
loans. Now, what did the Kettle do with
the money that was got for the Groper?
The Bananaland Full Court recently dis-
cussed the right of anyone to shoot a bull
when it charged. The case arose this way :
Farmer Rogers found the bull, a well-known
outlaw, in his patch of oats. When asked
to take himself off the premises the brute
showed fight, whereupon Rogers introduced
his rifle into the argument and toro got one
in the shoulder. A considerate jury recom-
mended him to mercy, but an acting-judge
responded by sentencing him to 18 months.
The Full Court gravely considered the rights
of such property, put up various arguments
about what a man should do rather than
shoot a charging bull, solemnly knocked them
down, and then cancelled the sentence on
sureties being found and the defendant pay-
ing certain costs. It has occurred before that
men have been found not guilty when they
potted a burglar who had a gun but no time
to shoot. But bull is private propputy.
Also a bull is worth more than a man. Was
not a man acquitted of a charge of man-
slaughter the same week in Sydney, on the
ground that, though he had fatally shot
another who was clambering over his bar
counter to fight him, he had done it in self-
defence V
“Rangan’s” libels :
Ever been to Toowoomba.? Best place in the
world for going to the Devil. Dropped in there last
week. Strolled into a bar. Full —of emptiness.
Rapped for attendant. Reverberation followed like
that which rumbles through a cathedral when the
bishop drops his teeth. Served by a cold goddess of
severe aspect. Drank in silence. Slunk out. Street
teeming with atmosphere. Mooched to corner.
Passed a J. Hop. Noticed he made an entry in his
notebook as I passed. After long walks looking for
population, came back and met the Law. “Say,” I
said, “where are the inhabitants?” “In bed,” he
answered. “Great Scot! What’s the time!” The
Law inspected its watch and returned a verdict of
minutes past 8. “Where’s the picture show?” I
put it to the Law as man to man. “Young feller,”
replied the Force, “we don’t want any riotous
behavior in this town to-night. Go off to bed.”
I went—and thirsty, too —frightened by the awful
loneliness of the bar.
Bananaland Government has just acquired
a State saw-mill and a State coal-mine. Both
of course were bought with loan money. A
State butchery and a State joinery are also
open, and, as is well known, the Govern-
ment is. also landlord of city cottage pro-
perty to the extent of £1,600,000 (also lOTJ,
of course). If nationalisation is the key
to the Working Man’s Paradise the Queens-
land toiler’s millennium is nearly in his
hand. But when the Australian democrat
(blind) puts out his arm to embrace nation-
alisation and finds that the goddess has a
big nose and uses it merely to ask for five
per cent., the aforesaid Australian democrat
is liable to get a horrible surprise.
Wheat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wheat!
The stuff we eat —•
When ground and mixed and baked (or boiled)
With meat,
Or fish, or what we wish ;
And always used by bishops when they bish.
Plain wheat—grain; wheat;
Consumed by both the plebs and the elite.
It’s an awkward subject now,
And there’s going to be a row
1 1! the quite-adjacent future over wheat.
AVheat!
A lot of heat
lias been engendered down where cookies meet,
And in the press, which swears a mess
Has been made by a gang who want to cheat
The man upon the land with the large and horny
hand,
And the honest agent bland,
Out of their wheat!*
Oh, tile situation’s mixed,
And a faked price has been fixed,
They maintain, to rob the grower of his wheat!
Wheat!
The magpies greet
Each morning clear and blue with whistles sweet;
By bush and plain
The parching grain implores Aquarius to wet its
feet,
Alas, in vain !
The grinning sun, like some fat llun in armor and
spiked helmet all complete,
Deals out his daily grilling
To the crops he’s slowly killing,
While the Government and the growers and the
bland and honest agents, and the newspapers;
and the shipping firms fight and squabble
about the fleet,
That they think will be needed
(And the Drought meantime’s unheeded),
To lift the estimated yield of wheat!
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, December IS, 1915.
My Dear Thabgomindait,—
A lady solicitor, Agnes McWhinney, of
Townsville, was admitted by the Full Court
last week. The lady, who is quite young
and of course pretty, isn’t) content with
being a mere six-and-eightpence, and proposes
to sit for examination as a barrister when
three more years have passed over her very
nice hair. But I shouldn’t be at all sur-
prised if some man doesn’t lodge a caveat.
When Kathleen Murray, the pretty little
squatting-family girl who once had leanings
towards the stage, was married in Sydney to
Graeme Watson, the Rev. Joseph Best had
the job, just as he had at the wedding of
the little bride’s parents. Afterwards a wed-
ding dinner was eaten in the white dining-
room at the Australia, which retained its
dignified air in spite of the blaze of a recent
Sunday. The scrumptious wedding veil was
made by Miss McKillop, formerly of the
Brisbane Technical College, an old friend of
the Murray clan.
Mayoress Down smiled on an enthusiastic
meeting of women who want to stitch sand-
bags. After deciding on making a start, and
on sending a wire to Sydney asking what
lace they should be trimmed with, the meet-
ing adjourned. The Mayor has called a
meeting of men for Wednesday to assist
in the good work.
The 9th Battalion (or as much of it as
has arrived home) had a reunion on Wednes-
day night. Adoring female relatives, and a
number of 15th Battalion men were also
present. One wounded soldier said he’d
had a horrible experience. When pressed
for details he told, with a catch in his breath,
of a duchess who had swooped down on a
hospital and gathered in a bunch of wounded
Australians. She took them home to her
ancestral hall, where, according to the
escapee, “fourteen knives and forks at every
meal” and “a bloke with padded legs” made
them thoroughly unhappy. At last a depu-
tation worked up its courage and addressed
the duchess respectfully as “Look here,
missus.” After which things were on a bet-
ter footing. But it’s the letters, the letters
the boys wanted —the letters from home.
And they seem to be able to get almost any-
thing else easier. The mail arrangements
for the Australian forces are still appalling.
At the Tivoli “A Fool There Was” draws
packed houses. The gallery even forgets to
munch fiercely at its chewing-gum when
Nellie Fergusson says to Roy Redgrave,
“Kiss me, my fool.” Daisy Jerome has
brought a bumper house to the Empire.
A recruiting poster depicts a spick-and-
span gent, unwinding yards of cloth before
the supercilious gaze of a lady customer.
The legend beneath the picture queries:
“Could a woman do your work? Then why
are you here?” Women doctors, women
clerks, even (excuse me) women journalists
earn crusts these days. "Why not issue
reproaching the males of all these
species? Anyhow, why clout one harder
than another?
The Valley Crfeche and Kindergarten held
the usual Christmas tree on Thursday night.
The tree this year was an unusually elaborate
affair, presented and decorated bv Mrs.
Thompson, who is an energetic committee
woman.
The concert in aid of the Christmas Toy
Fund, which was to have happened at the
Stadium on Thursday, was put off until
Monday because of the great wetness of the
rain which fell- all day and night.
Alice Kirkland, Betty Cockburn and vari-
ous other nice girls are arranging a concert,
to be held at the Military Hospital on
Friday evening. There are a few soldier
boys there who will not be able to get home
for Christmas, and the little songandance
will keep them from feeling quite lonely.
The Goold-Adamses to-day laid the founda-
tion-stone of a Presbyterian church at
Goodna.
Dr. Sweet —sister of Dr. Georgina Sweet,
who recently toured the world in search of
the cause of the beef nodule —has gone
south to Melbourne from the very top of
Australia. She inspects school children for
the Bananaland Government, and incidentally
collects much interesting information on her
travels. Fortunately she can find fun in
even the vagaries of a mulga pub.
The convalescing Captain Cosens, the
Goold-Adamses’ newest Help, has gone
south to meet his wife, who is to step out
of the incoming mail-boat.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The Bulletin has been asked by Mrs.
Cleary, referred to last week in connection
with the “Xylite” case, to state that the
reference to her having been a “barmaid” in
Sydney was inaccurate, she never having
been employed in that capacity. The legal
proceedings in which she is immediately
concerned have reference to the validity of
a provisional Federal warrant applying for
her extradition to Queensland, no charge of
conspiracy or anything else being advanced.

To those who are troubled with sore, tender,
aching, swollen, perspiring, unpleasant smelling
feet, bunions, corns or hard skin, “BIFF” will
bring quick relief and gladness to the feet. Use
“BIFF” today and banish all pain and discomfit.
By using “BIFF” once a week you will insure
your feet against all foot troubles. “BIFF” is a
scientific compound which draws out all poisonous
matter from the feet, which clog and choke pores
of the skin. One application of this unique com-
pound will render the feet sweet and antiseptic.
Its delightful results must be experienced to be
believed.
MRS. CARTER WRITES For years my feet
gave me much trouble. It was purgatory to
have to walk far, but after using one box of
“Biff” I can walk with perfect ease and com-
fort, there is nothing to compare with your
preparation for foot trouble.”
“Biff” can be obtained through all chemists and
stores; if not in stock send direct to the manu-
facturers. Price Is. 6d. per box, or triple size box
4s. (triple box contains three times the Is.6d. size).

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones —
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste there would be no
further need of sermons, preach-
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth.” is the dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all tooth decay. ■ Pebecc
Tooth Paste arrests this acidity of
the mouth —even destroys the
acid-producing bacteria them-
selves.
You have not settled the
problem of your teeth by merely
keeping them white, clean and
polished. Pebeco Tooth Paste
will SAVE them.

This Week s TOILET HINTS
THE LATEST AND SMARTEST BEAUTY RECIPES COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS
EXPERT BEAUTY WRITERS.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
An instantaneous remedy for blackheads, oily skin
and enlarged pores.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly cor-
rected by a unique new process. A tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, is dropped
in a tumbler of hot water which will then of
course “fizz” briskly. When the effervescence
has subsided the face is bathed with the
stymol-charged water and then dried with a
towel. The offending blackheads, of their own
accord, come right off on the towel, the large
oily pores immediately contract and efface
themselves naturally. There is no squeezing,
forcing or any drastic action. The skin is
left uninjured, smooth, soft and cool. A few
such treatments should be taken at intervals
of three or four days thereafter in order to
ensure the permanence of the pleasing result
so quickly obtained.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned, home-made recipe restores youthful
appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey hair
is not desirable and plenty of reasons why
hair dyes should not be used. But, on the
other hand, there is no reason why you should
have grey hair if you do not want it. To turn
the hair back to a natural color is really a
very simple matter. One has only to get from
the chemist an ounce of concentrate of tamma-
lite and mix it with four ounces of bay rum.
Apply to the hair with a small sponge for a
few nights and the greyness will gradually
disappear. This liquid is not sticky or greasy
and does not injure the hair in any way. It
has been used for generations with most satis-
factory results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of
Superfluous Hair.
“Home Science.”
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but bow
to kill the hair roots permanently, hor ini.
purpose pure powdered pheminol may u
applied directly to the objectionable bai
growth. The recommended treatment
designed not' only to instantly remove tne
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol. obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
The Real Cause of Most
Bad Complexions.
“Health and Beauty.”
It is an accepted fact that no truly beautiful
complexion ever came out of jars and bottles,
and the longer one uses cosmetics the worse
the complexion becomes. Skin, to be nealtny,
must breathe. It also must expel, througn
the pores, its share of the body s eftete
material. Creams and powders clog the
pores, interfering both with elimination and
breathing. If more women understood tins
there would be fewer self-ruined complexions.
If they would use ordinary mercolised wax
instead of cosmetics they would have natural
healthy complexions.
About Hair Tonics.
“Novel Recipes.”
Each week almost one hears of some won-
derful discovery for improving the hair, and
although this paragraph may seem a little
superfluous, an old-fashioned recipe may come
as a welcome change. One thing about it is
that it will grow hair, and also prevent it
falling out. From your chemist get an origi-
nal package of boranium, to this add J-pint of
bay rum, allow it to stand 30 minutes, then
add sufficient water to make half a pint. Bub
briskly into the scalp with the finger-tips and
you will immediately experience that clean
tingling sensation which is a sure sign of
healthy action. [2

“De Oriel”: Surely this must be a record
for continuous coach driving. Tom Berri-
gan, of Corryong (Vic.), has just handed
in his whip, though still well and husky,
after daily piloting his team for 22 years
between Corryong and Tallangatta (50
miles). Four days only has he missed dur-
ing that period, and that was when he had
to do a turn in the witness-box.
Chaffey, M.L.A., adds to the number of
N, S. Wales State politicians who have en-
listed. He leaves as lieutenant without any
feeling that the country may go to the dogs
because he is not in his place in Parliament
to hear Holman “explain” matters and some-
one threaten to pull someone else’s nose.
In fact, though the newest members gener-
ally suffer most from an exalted idea of
their political importance. Chaffey’s view is
that the present Assembly is merely a
national misfortune.
Auckland has been holding a “Queen
Carnival” to raise money for the Dominion’s
wounded fighting men. Practically every-
thing the village had to offer, from the Town
Hall to kisses, was put up to auction; art
unions raged unashamed at every street
corner; wowsers, howling that it was a crime
and a sin, struggled to get tickets in the
hope of landing a £3OO nugget for a humble
bob; mock courts were held everywhere, and
all and sundry were run in and fined
sums from £5O downwards for any old thing
that the Court happened to think of; flappers
armed with boxes chased stray silver till
they fell in a faint. When the frolic ended
with a wild jamboree in Queen-street
£269,644 was found in the till, and when
the mail left cash was still dribbling in from
all quarters.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” has received the
following
In The Bulletin of November 18 you make some
very kind references to my late father and mother.
Mrs. Ford was 93f years old when she died the
other day, and she had her brain clear to the last.
During her 30 years at the Cape Otway lighthouse
(1849 to 1879) she had only seven trips to Mel-
bourne. My father used to come up every year
to order supplies, etc. During the first 10 years
(1849 to 1859) the supply vessel used to visit
them only once a year ; after that twice each year.
The lonely life was not so bad. I was reared there.
The first news of gold beng found in my
father saw in some London papers sent him. That
shows how we were cut off. But in 1860 a telegraph
office was built, and after that we used to hear how
the world was going.
Out of it all, at the age of 66, G. O. Starr,
who succeeded James M. Bailey as partner
of P. T. Barnum. Starr commenced life in
Connecticut, and was a doctor by the will of
his father, but dropped practice and with
another chap ran a dime museum. Barnum
happened along a few years later and
snapped up Starr as a press-agent, a busi-
ness in which he at once made a violent
noise. In ’B7 he was sent to Europe as
manager of the B. and B. enterprises, and
at the same time ran on his own account
Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and “The Human
Cannon Ball,” which was Starr’s wife shot
out of a gun. Bailey died in ’BB, and Starr
became head of the big organisation. He
navigated the tents and clowns for 17 years.
Then the Crystal Palace grabbed him, and
he was there until the war turned the glass-
house into a nursery for soldiers.
“Hamer”: The Actors’ Union has some
vitality again. It’s a queer bit of history.
The organisation when it got going last
time immediately excited the antagonism of
the managements, which was displayed so
strongly that the actors with good jobs to
lose feared to come forward to help the
infant, and let all the limelight fall on men
who were a good deal out of the profession.
That gave a pretext for the formation of the
high-toned Actors’ Association, with which
were associated the names of many, of the
best-known performers. When the Union died
the people who wanted, the militant organi-
sation commenced to join the Association,
which thus formed the nucleus of a move-
ment to do the very thing the Association
was born to oppose.
The scramble to possess Strawberry goes
on in Maoriland. Recently at a sale down at
the south end the competition was so frantic
that 24 cows were sold by auction, head by
head, inside 30 minutes. One changed hands
at £2O, and several realised over £l7. With
land climbing up towards the £lOO an acre
mark, and Strawberry fetching inflated
values like the above, and the Great lOU
leaning over the front gate waiting until
The Time Is Ripe, what chance has a cocky
who is just making a start, or a returned
soldier with little capital and less experi-
ence, of getting anything out of . the game
but a collection of corns on his willing
hands?
It was 100 years ago on December 12
since James Kelly, a Parramatta-born Aus-
tralian, then 24 years of age, set out from
Hobart in a whale-boat to circumnavigate
Tasmania. Of his crew two, George Briggs
and John Griffith, were natives of N. S.
Wales, so it was predominantly a Young
Australia enterprise; the other two, Wil-
liam Jones and Thomas Toombs, were Eng-
lishmen. Kelly and his crew were the dis-
coverers of Port Davey and Macquarie Har-
bor, and had some exciting adventures with
Black Brother at various points. Near
the Pieman River about a score of natives
came up to them each dragging, so Kelly
says in his log, a spear between the big toe
and the next toe of each foot. It looked
like a row, but they squared things by giv-
ing the blackfellows a badger and four
swans. The tallest yarn in Kelly’s log is
about a 6ft. 7in. blackfellow on Hunter’s
Island, who cleared 33ft. from a standing
jump. Kelly says he measured this him-
self. When they put into Georgetown the
whole boat’s crew were arrested as bush-
rangers, but their clearance from Hobart
Town saved them. On the East Coast they
put in a week or two sealing, or, rather,
they got the native womeu to do the work
and gathered in about 100 skins worth a
guinea apiece for a few shillings’ worth of
tobacco and other odds and ends and a pre-
sent of the carcases. The circumnavigation
took seven weeks. Kelly’s log was dug up
years after and buried as a Parliamentary
paper.

Irritating and Sore. Nearly Tore
Her Head to Pieces. Hair Fell
Out. Cuticura Healed.
55 Campbell St.. Glebe, Anst.—“My lit-
tle girl’s bead broke all out in a rash, •which
was very irritating and sore, and on account
of the irritation she nearly tore her head to
pieces. Through her constant scratching it
broke out into sores and her hair fell out
and got very thin.
"A friend told me how good the Cuticura
Remedies were for skin and scalp troubles
and the great benefit her husband gained
by them. She brought me a tin of the Cuti-
cura Ointment to use on my child’s head,
which we applied and washed her head
with the Cuticura Soap, when all the sores
were healed and the rash disappeared and
now her head is as clean as can be.”

Have You a BAD LEG
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your linger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
If so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Per-
haps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with tire ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored, the disease,

THIS instep-strap shoe has been specially
designed to look trim and dainty
beneath those delightfully feminine
frills and flounced hems that have
returned to vogue again. It is a particularly
pretty shoe, with a fine air of individuality
about it. The front part is patent leather,
and the back and strap are black flowered
brocade, set off by an attractive slide and
ornament of dull silver. The picture gives
some idea of the happiness of this combina-
tion, but the shoe itself is far more charm-
ing than the picture. Made in the dainty,
short-fronted shape and with that smart
Cuban heel which makes walking so comfort-
able, it really is a “find” in the way of
shoes. And ladies will see other and equally
delightful shoes in the latest Bostoek ship-
ments, especially if they view them at once.

The Inky Way.
Artist Colies kills our faith in the war
reporter:—
It was amongst pictures and paragraphs on “Bee-
Fattening” and “How to Break in Wild Roses” that
I first came across that stirring story of the Aus-
tralian soldier who landed and fought his Turkish
opponent over the edge of a sea-cliff, and then held
the enemy under water until he was drowned —all
packed away under a handsome portrait of Sergeant
Mundy.
I am in the position to offer some interesting side-
lights on this incident. First, Sergeant Mundy
wasn’t in Gallipoli; second, the cliff wasn’t in
Gallipoli. I don’t know about the Turk. All the
same, Sergeant Mundy was guilty of distinguished
conduct. His opportunity was brought by a couple
of Arab stallions, which, harnessed to a carriage,
commenced to mangle the crowded traffic in a street
in Cairo. Being a light-horseman, an Australian,
and handy to the trouble, Mundy proceeded to put a
stop to the horses’ silly business. In the course of
the argument one animal seized on his hand with its
teeth; and a bayonet had to be used to persuade
the beast to let go. The hand was badly injured,
and it fell to my lot to oversee the healing, being
at the time one of the A.M.C. attached to the camp
of the Light Horse which was left on the race-
course at Heliopolis. Those thus left were a
fretful crowd, ever asking when? —when? And
Mundy was one of my reluctant daily visitors
for many, many weeks. So how the deuce —well,
there have been some wonderful fakes on the part of
Australian crusaders, but the cliff furphy beats all.
However, I understand that if his country will
insist on his being a hero, and simply must have
the precipice-fable, Mundy is prepared to submit
plans and specifications for a suitable cliff with a
water frontage, and will construct it and take on
the job of professional hero at a reasonable salary.

Henry Lucy, who tells the S. M. Herald
week by week about the great men whom he
has assisted to keep England up to the mark,
shone with extra effulgence in describing a
Zeppelin raid. Dining, as usual, with “a
small circle of well-known men,” although
for once in a way there wasn’t “a certain
very High Personage who must be name-
less” amongst the crowd—probably an over-
sight of Lucy’s—the noise of a Zep. was
heard and seven of the guests bolted. But
not Lucy ! No !
I had just lit another excellent cigar, and was not
inclined to waste its fragrance on the night air. I
felt that 1 could exercise no more personal influence
on a Zeppelin than I might upon an earthquake.
So I remained seated at the table and contempla-
tively smoked my cigar.
The cigar, of course, was one of those
presented to him by a certain Duke whose
taste in matters of tobacco is unriv-
alled; but Lucy in his hurry forgot to
mention it. In fact, the admission that he
could exert no personal influence on a Zep-
pelin hints that Lucy is becoming not only
forgetful, but humble-

“D.F.”: R. L. Murray, the old-time Inky
Way battler who ran the Tasmanian and
Austral-Asiatic Review (B. 2/12/T5),
was originally a captain in the army, and
got a free passage for bigamy. While sta-
tioned in Ireland in his youth he went
through the form of marriage with a Pres-
byterian lady, and seems to have got the idea
that it was a Scotch marriage and not
legally binding. Years aftewards he mar-
ried someone else ; somebody gave him away
and the law shipped him to Van Diemen’s
Land.

As a State our financial position is already very
unstable, and the future looms dark with gathering
clouds, —S. M. Herald. - ,
Betsy, my precious lamb, I looks towards yer.
Though chased in sperrit, w’ich may be excuged
In these here dreffle days, w’en ’Olman lords yer
Like so much dirt; an’ w’en yer name’s abuged
Behind yer back by parties wot have sought arter
yer an’ impoged upon yer, bein’ cunnin’ and
not to be refuged!
Five long an’ prosperous years ’ave flown —how
quickly!—•
Since I took up with ’Olman’s dratted crew,
An’’welcomed ’em as Statesmen, facin’ prickly
An’ awkward questions w’ich ’ad, some’ow, grew
up along of the commin people’s gettin’ ideers
. of eddieation w’ich they didn’t ought to have,
’cos it'll never do!
You know, my Betsy, ’ow I made concessions
For inexperienged parties, an’ forsook
(At least, left tempiry-like) old prepossessions,
An’ the Grand Old Party follerin’ Joe Cook an’
Wade, an’ business-like methods, w’ich no
offence is intended to no one, but is best for
the country wot lays to its bookl
'Ow ’ave we bin deceived! My goodness gracious!

Arter a-lavisin’ colyums free an’ spacious,
Praisin’ ’em up, and ’elpin, and adwisin’ ’em, and
takin’ sich notice on ’em, an’ gettin’ ’em to
believe there wasn’t no one to compare with

Arter me doin’ all that, and ignorin’
Tiie remonstranges of our crowd, w’ich got jealous,
An’ said ’arsli things, ’intin’ ’as ’ow we wos a-drorin’
A quid pro quo, like them old Roman fellows, in

And, now, Betsy, wot do we see? Clouds a-gatherin’
Over our ’eads, an’ those we said was wonders
Is just proved frauds—a bragian band a-blatherin’,
And braggin’, and borrerin’, an’ makin’ blunders,
and not doin’ anything to meet the storm —
no; not even a-beggin’ a humberella or a
novercoat, or a-gettin’ in out of the wet, an’

How to
Withstand
Hot
Weather.
THE HEATED TERM.
The heated term is withstood without
a whimper by those people who have a
healthy stomach. Hot weather cannot
hurt the man or woman whose stomach
and digestive organs are perfectly
healthy. But you go into December or
January with a disordered stomach, and
see what the result will be.
SUNSTROKE.
Sunstroke attacks only the man or
woman whose stomach or digestive or-
gans are too feeble to protect the
strength, and maintain one’s physical
power to resist the depressing effects of
the summer’s sun.
SUMMER DIET.
Summer diet, with all its vegetables
and unripe fruit, adds its unstable influ-
ence to the depressing effects of hot
weather, causing a still greater decline
in one’s strength and vitality.
IF THE STOMACH IS OUT OF
ORDER.
Ninety-nine out of every one hundred
people whose health and strength run
down in summer allow their stomach or
digestive organs to get out of order.
This is easy enough—in fact, it is hard
to prevent without the use of some thor-
oughly reliable digestant.
TAKE DR. SHELDON’S DIGES-
TIVE TABULES.
One of Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tab-
ules, taken after meals, is not only the
thoroughly reliable digestant, but it con-
tains great tonic and reconstructive
properties as well. This famous remedy
enables the stomach and digestive or-
gans to thoroughly digest, assimilate,
and contribute to the tissues all the
nourishment that is contained in *such
food as may be eaten.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules lay the foundation for health and the
up-building of strength by purifying and sweetening the glands and membranes of
the stomach, and by supplying natural, juices necessary to perfect digestion, assimi-
lation and nutrition. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules prevent Colic, Cholera,
Diarrhoea, Flux, Dysentery and summer complaints generally, and their use will
eradicate Indigestion and Chronic Dyspepsia at once. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive
Tabules are good alike for old and young. Sold at 1/6 and 2/6 per tin.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was a beastly hot clay; 92° under the
Post Office Arcade and God-knows-liow-
much in the wilds of Pyrmont, where
Dicky Hurton had just made his usual 11
o’clock selection at Casey’s lunch counter.
Devilled kidneys washed down with the cus-
tomary whisky and soda, flavored by a stale
jest with the blonde barmaid before he
slipped out into the sun-blistered street and
faced the hot wind.
His smelly skin store was only five min-
utes’ walk away, but it seemed _ a mile.
Things were pretty rotten in the hide busi-
ness. The drought and the war were play-
ing the devil with things. A fellow didn’t
know where he was. At least Dicky didn’t
know where he was.
(Compton and Co.’s bill was due to-mor-
row.)
The perspiration trickled from under his
hat, ran down his fat jowl and soaked into
his already limp collar. The hot pavement
burned through his boot-soles. The dust
choked him. What little wind there was
felt like a blast from a brick kiln.
(He would see Compton by himself that
afternoon.)
There was one part of the street which
he always hated to pass. A _ blank stretch
of white wall enclosing a piece of waste
ground between two wool stores. It always
suggested to him that on its further side
lay a disused cemetery. Yet he knew very
well that there was nothing there but some
scrapped machinery.
(Compton would have to renew that bill
for another thirty days.)
Dicky had a heavy day before him. He
must put a step in. Not that he was in-
clined for effort of any description. A hot
day always made him lazy. He would like
a week at Tuggerah. Pishing. That would
be great. Looking down into the dark green
water. The nip-nip of the fish at the end
of the line, and then hand over
Coming straight at him was the last man
on earth whom he wanted to meet —Comp-
ton’s accountant, not ten yards away.
Then in the hated wall, right at his elbow,
a door opened. A little black door. Just
the height of a man, but so narrow that
Dicky, who was plump of figure, had to
squeeze to get through it. With a sigh of
relief he heard it shut softly behind him and
found himself in a cool, moonlit gallery at
the tail end of a long procession of cowled
figures who walked two abreast chanting a
plaintive melody. Somewhere, far in the
lead, a muffled drum throbbed monotonously.
The passage was A'ery long and very
narrow; so narrow that the procession,
marching heavily and pausing on each step,
brushed the Avails with its SAvaying
shoulders. It Avas so long that the end was
lost in vague sliadoAV. In the dim light the
peaked cowls, undulating rhythmically,
looked like the articulations on the back of
a great Avorm. The floor Avas cool and
springy as a carpet of green moss, and high
up on the Avails banners swung pendulously.
Dicky carried his hat in his hand. It
seemed the proper thing to do as he stepped
in time to the solemn beat of that distant
drum.
Dicky rather enjoyed it. Unconsciously
he realised the spirit of the thing, felt that
lie was part of the show. He walked for
hours without exhaustion. Eyes shut, head
and shoulders bent, swaying from side to
side.
The drum gave a double beat and they
were in a vast space, where stone pillars
towered like tree trunks and lost themselves
iu an altitude which no man could measure.
The procession deployed to the right and
left, and Dicky found himself standing in
front of a great rose window of stained glass
beneath which tapers were beginning to
wink upon a great altar. On its lower step
a coffin rested, covered by a white pall. The
cowled figures formed a wide semi-circle,
and glancing over his shoulder Dicky saw
that they were as the sands of the sea for
multitude.
Again the drum beat twice and the chant
ceased as a little, grey-bearded man ascended
the rostrum and began to pray. Ilis voice
had the thin tones of great age, and. he
spoke in a strange tongue. Supplication,
vindication, praise and blame, sarcasm and
pity, glory and grief, all had a place in his
outpouring. It soothed Dicky like the vox
Humana stop of a great organ. Presently
lie turned and showed a face haggard and
yellow as a skull. Green pin-points blazed
in his shadowed orbits, his cliin-whisker
wagged obscenely as, mumbling something
that might have been a benediction or a
curse, he pointed at Dicky Ilurton.
Slowly the cowled figures raised their
arms, flung back their sleeves with a quick
gesture, and pointed each a fleshless finger
at Dicky.
It was all double beats on the drum now.
Ir unnerved Dicky, and he would have col-
lapsed utterly only he was seized from
behind and pressed towards the coffin. The
old priest swept the pall aside. With a
superhuman effort Dicky shook himself free
of the clutching hands and turned and ran.
The drum thundered tempestuously. The
cowled figures kilted their skirts and, gibber-
ing incoherently, took up the chase, led by
the old priest. Winged by terror, Dicky
flew; but ever at his heels was the pad-pad
of a multitude of following feet. They loped
along without effort as if they meant to
accompany rather than to recapture. Strive
as he might, Dicky could not shake them
off, and the little black door seemed so far
away. The persistent thudding of the drum
drove him on, and he thought he could last
the distance. It couldn’t be so very far
now, for here were the flapping banners and
there the converging walls- Another mile
or a mile and a half and he would reach
the little black door beyond which lay the
sunlit street and safety. He was sure he
could do it. The chatter behind him was
less voluble and the drum was throbbing
more consistently. He was all right.
Another hundred yards—fifty, twenty, ten
yards—and springing at the little black
door lie pulled it open and staggered into
the sunshine.
Compton’s accountant ran a couple of
steps and caught him before he fell. Later
in the day he told Compton that Dicky was
failing physically as well as financially.
Of course Dicky knew that it w y as only
the heat, and, being one of those hard cases
who never have a headache in their lives,
was quite ashamed of his queer turn, but
realised that he ought to see a doctor about
it. Not that he could tell all the silly tale
to an utter stranger —he would think he was
mad. So he dropped in during the evening
on Dr. Jim Brady, a chap he used to go to
school with, and told it rather as a humorous
adventure than as a serious experience. Jim
smiled and listened sympathetically. He
felt Dicky’s pulse, examined his chest, made
him hop round the room and take deep
breaths, as if he w T ere a real patient to be
charged so much a visit and not merely an
old chum who had popped in to tell a funny
yarn. Dicky was quite huffy about it, and
when Dr. Jim wrote him a prescription and
advised abstemiousness in food and drink,
even counselled him to confine himself to
two cigars a day, Dicky said it was all
damn rot and not the sort of thing to pass
out to a boyhood friend.
“Sorry,” said Dr. Jim. “but I can’t have
you ducking in at that little black door
again. They mightn’t let you out next
time, Dicky.”
Compton renewed Dicky’s bill in spite of
the protests of his accountant, and Dicky
lived very quietly for nearly three weeks.
He feared and avoided the blank wall.
Since he had “cut out the booze” his route
did not lie along it so frequently as before.
Moreover, he found that one whisky and
soda just before going to bed sent him to
sleep. Yes. And one at the end of the
day didn’t hurt him any, either. This was
encouraging, so he had one at lunch-time
as well; for if a man has to cut all the nice
things out of his life in order to live he
might just as well be dead.
The very next day he walked the whole
length of the blank wall. There was no
door there. There never had been one. It
was all bunkum.
He turned in at Casey’s pub and had a
pitch with the blonde barmaid. She was
very solicitous about his welfare, and he
assured her that the absurd rumors about
his being on the water-waggon were entirely
v/it bout foundation. He proved it to her
several times- —and made a date with her
for 11 a.m. next day if she would guarantee
devilled kidneys on the side table. It was a
bet.
He was quite all right.
He slapped himself manfully on the chest
as the office clock pointed to 10.55 next
morning. He took his hat and cocked it
jauntily over one ear, and grinning defiance
at Dr. Brady’s advice set out for Casey’s
pub, the blonde barmaid and the devilied
kidneys by the route of the blank wall.
There it stretched in all its vacant white-
ness.
Not a door in it, not even a crack.
He pursed his lips to spit his contempt at
it—and the little black door opened again.
“Heart failure,” said the Coroner. But
Dr. Jim Brady knew that Dicky Ilurton
had gone through the little black door for
good.

SYMPTOMS " KIDNEY TROUBLE
such as Lumbago, Rheumatism, Dropsy,
Backache, Gravel, Stone, Sciatica,
and Bladder Disorders
ARE SERIOUS.
>
v
‘ 1 Every Picture
tells a Story.”
You never know wliat complications kidney trouble may lead to.
Healthy kidneys purify the blood and enable it to vitalise the system,
but when the kidneys are weakened or diseased this all-important process is
reversed. Poisons and waste matter remain in the blood, to spread disease
throughout the body.
Uric acid is your worst enemy in this respect, for its jagged crystals
settle in the muscles, nerves and joints, and agonise each movement of your
limbs.
riiat sharp, shooting pain in the back is Lumbago—the pain that darts
through the thigh or leg is Sciatica—the sickening ache and constant pain
across the shoulders, and in the hands, knees and joints is Rheumatism.
°nly most careful treatment and a special kidney medicine can revive
the failing kidneys, and Loan s Backache Kidney Pills are for the kidneys
and bladder onfy—they gently regulate, heal and strengthen them, and
enable the kidneys, to drain the uric acid and collected water from the body,
to cleanse and purify the blood and to flush and soothe the urinary system.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills do not act on the bowels.
Cured to Stay Cured.
A SYDNEY MAN.
Mr. Geo. Hurcum, 63 Campbell Street,
Glebe, says:—“l strained my back about
two and a half years ago, and shortly
afterwards caught a chill, which settled in
the small of my back just above the kid-
neys. From then until quite lately I
have. been suffering agony with backache.
At times the pain was so severe that it
was impossible for me to bend or turn.
I consulted a doctor, but his treatment
did me no good. Hearing of cures effected
by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, I de-
cided to give them a trial. After taking
a course I was perfectly cured, and have
had no return of the trouble. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills are a boon to all
who suffer with backache.”
Three years later Mrs. Hurcum says :
“My husband has been entirely free of
backache since his cure by Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills over three years ago.”
A SYDNEY WOMAN.
Mrs. E. Weir, 168 Botany Road, Alex-
andria, Sydney, says :—“ln common with
many others I can give Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills a first-class recommendation
as a cure for backache and kidney dis-
order, these pills having cured me of a
bad attack some few months ago. Before
I took this remedy I suffered terribly, my
back being so stiff and painful that I
could hardly get about. In fact, I have
been so bad that I have had to lay up,
being almost crippled with the awful pain.
My ankles and legs swelled considerably
and were sore to the touch, and I was
also subject to dizzy attacks. I could
not get proper rest at night, and in con-
sequence always felt dull and tired and
had no energy. However, a course of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills soon put
an end to my health troubles, and I have
been grand ever since.”

Mr. 11. \\ atson, sen., 210 Denison Street, Oamperdown, Sydney, says:—“A
couple of years ago I had Eczema break out very badly on my chest. It was shortly
alter I bad returned from a trip to India, where I had gone with horses. I had fever
badly in India, and the. Eczema seemed to be the result of this sickness. It was very
severe and spread rapidly, until I was in such a state that the pain and irritation
nearly drove me mad. When I went to bed at night my sufferings were worst, and it
was nearly morning before I could get to sleep. A man I know advised me to get
Doan’s Ointment, saying that he had heard of excellent results from the use of this
preparation. I thought it a good idea, and obtained a pot. The first application
was cooling, and the second soothed the itch, and after that I got along splendidly.
Every time I applied the Ointment there was a marked improvement, until I was
quite cured. Within a month from the first time I used the Ointment not one trace'
of the ailment remained. Doan’s Ointment is a splendid preparation for Eczema,
skin irritation, to take inflammation from, the skin, and to heal.”
Ten years later, Mr. Watson confirms the above :—“lt is now ten years since
Doan’s Ointment cured me of Eczema, and I am pleased to say that the cure has
stood the test of time. lam still quite free of this dreadful complaint.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2/9 per pot,

The Rope.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JWAS walking on a misty November
morning behind the German lines in
Woewre with the pale and nervous
Major Brockstein and the apoplectic haupt-
mann Konradt. After going through the
papers which certified to my being an
American correspondent and authorised me
to follow the operations of the 2nd Line,
and having had my nasal twang severely
tested by experts, the Major had quite taken
a fancy to me. He used to smooth things
over for me and never refused necessary
passes; besides, war was stagnant in the
first-line trenches, and nothing ever hap-
pened.
“Do you believe in ghosts?” the Major
suddenly jerked out, while Konradt in-
dulged in a ponderous wink, widening into
a grin. Do you think a dead man could
come back for revenge’s sake?”
“Well, there are many things beyond our
ken, j 7 ou know.”
‘ Listen, 111 tell you. This is, of course,
strictly between ourselves, and must on no
account get in your papers. Here are the
facts. Last August, at the time of the
great German rush, my regiment bivouacked
near Compiegne. I spent the night in a
fine place. Konradt and a feldwehbel and
three soldiers were with me. The lady of
the house and her young daughter were
charming. And such wines! I’m rather
hazy as to what happened. .. .war. .. .it
was no worse than elsewhere. But after
. . . .what happened the woman wrote to her
husband and shot herself and the girl.
Strategical moves then compelled us to
retire northwards. The husband returned,
several hours too late. He read the letter
and saw the corpses and what was left of
the house. He was a middle-aged man, of
an irascible temperament, I should say by
what followed. He swore that all those
who’d spent that notorious night there
should be killed by his hand. Armed with
a shotgun he lurked near our outposts. Not
for long. They cornered him one night in
the hills and riddled him with holes, like a
sieve. I was there. I can still see his
heavy, lurching fall, the body bounding
down the slope and smashing on the rocks
below. I found out for certain that French
peasants buried him the next day....and
yet”....
Major Brockstein stopped, his eyes staring
at the snow-capped hills, and then his voice
altered.
“And yet, since then, the soldiers who
were with us that night have all been mur-
dered in turn, and under incredible circum-
stances. One in liis dug-out, asleep with
his _ mates, who heard no sound. Another
behind. a hedge, while writing to his girl.
The third like the other two. And all three
strangled! There’s only feldwehbel Klein,
Konradt and myself now.”
“These are only coincidences,” I replied.
“llow can a dead man strangle your men?
Let’s walk on, Major; it’s getting chilly.”
On nearing the township we noticed a
group of soldiers around a corpse lying stiff
under its grey uniform, the eyes ghastly,
the whole of the features frozen with an
unnamed fear, and peculiar pink markings
■on the swollen neck.
“The feldwehbel Klein,” stuttered Kon-
radt. Brockstein’s face resembled the dead
man’s.
* * * «
On the following days the Major and the
hauptmann never left the village, unless
escorted each by four armed soldiers, and
brutal repressive measures were taken, as
reprisals, against the few remaining in-
habitants. The other officers, as well as
the troopers, were anxious. Fear, bred of
superstition, is contagious. Flow could one
admit that a living enemy, whoever he might
be, could cross the lines and safely deal his
blows with such deadly precision? Pre-
cautions seemed to be of no avail whatso-
ever. Klein had stopped to light a cigar
on returning from a night’s fatigue party,
in close proximity to the houses. He was
never again seen alive. His strangled corpse
was found at the other end of the village.
Konradt was the first to regain his old
confidence and to laugh, in j>ett,o, at the
Major’s tremors. Yet he always fingered his
automatic.
One night the sentries posted at his door
and window heard sounds of a scuffle and
muffled cries inside. They rushed in, only to
find the hauptmann lying dead on the floor,
strangled. The medical officer recognised
tlie same markings on his neck as on those of
the other victims. The.y didn’t appear to
he finger-marks, but evidently were caused
by a clumsily-plaited rope.
I met the Major in the morning sur-
rounded by a guard and looking more of a
prisoner than a commanding officer. He
called me over, as if he wished to speak to
me, but he could only falter shakily: “I’m
the only one left now... .the last.”
I. started to take my leave, as my pass
expired on the morrow, but he interrupted
me: “No, don’t go. I can’t stay alone. I’ll
renew your pass and stand the racket.”
I stayed. He often sent for me at night,
and spent it talking. He, in this way,
dodged his dread ; a little only, though, sit-
ting in a corner, with staring, unseeing-
eyes and faltering voice.
* * * *
One night, which I will never forget, his
batman called me up to see him at about
nine o’clock.
The weather was atrocious; the icy
November wind howled on the tiles and
whistled through the trees, black and bare.
Heavy clouds chased each other, hardly
leaving a glimpse of the moon.
The Major lived in a big room, at the top
of snail-like stairs, in an old manor-cam-
farmhouse. He unlocked the door for me
and then barricaded himself anew 7. I heard
Ihe batman going below.
“Thanks for coming. I’m ill to-night.
It’s no.use struggling. I feel a mysterious
presence about me. And _then the moon’s
ghastly. In spite of the closed shutters and
tlie lamp she sneaks in her greenish, uncanny
rays. Ugh! Oh, what’s that?” '~

Out of Spain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LAST moon my lord came out of Spain,
On a cold grey dawn in a cold grey
rain;
And as lie.rode over the sodden ground
There crawled behind him a great black
hound.
Margot, the scullery wench, she laughed:
“Never a beaker has Master quaffed
Of English ale that is clear and fine;
He cries ‘A bumper of Spanish wine. J
Out upon Spaniards !” Margot says—
“l find me naught in their furrin’ ways !”
A stringed guitar has my lord brought home
And tasseled boots for our village loam ;
A silken sash, and a velvet mask,
And Spanish wines in a weighty cask;
Jewels, too, has the Master brought,
Silken, cords with a diamond caught,
A popish cross, and a frock gold hemmed,
A cut-throat dagger with handle gemmed,
A feathered hat, and “a coat of mail —
And no palate left for October ale!
My lady smiled when my lord came back,
Dressed herself in a satin sttcque,
Powdered deeply her chestnut hair,
And prankt herself with a bridal air;
But the foreign jewels seemed out of place
With her rosy skin and her English face.
Out of the night the Stranger came,
Lace mantilla and eyes like flame,
Clicking bracelet and fluttering fan,
And the baby mouth that can spoil a man ;
High red shoes on her little feet,
Rose in her bosom, red and sweet ;
And she swept a curtsey that touched the
ground,
And patted the head of the big black hound.
Never a word of our English tongue!
Reuben sniggered, but he is young
My lady rose with a scarlet face,
And signed the other to take her place;
And the Master shuffled his feet, and
frowned,
And spat an oath at the cringing hound.
But his hand on the Spanish goblet shook
And his eyes were turned from my lady’s
look.
Ever since, my lord came out of Spain
We are fain to wishing him there again ;
For Lace Mantilla she shivers and shakes
At the sound the rain on the window makes.
And Reuben goes piling higher and higher
Good beechen logs on the chimney fire ;
We could burn the castle to the ground
Nor warm herself and that cursed hound !
They crouch in front of the blaze all day;
On her jaunty slippers the elf lights play,
And the blue-flame dance, where the red coal
lies,
Leaps back from the black hound’s yellow
eyes;
While her useless fan is tightly pressed
To the popish cross on her olive breast.
And her eyes are sad as the grave pits are....
While my lady fingers the stringed guitar
As though she ponders, and strives in vain.
To guess what my lord has brought from
Spain !
And my lord sits up in his tower alone.
Where the gannets circle and sea winds
moan,
And the priceless Spanish wines are spilt
As his fingers play with a dagger’s hilt.
And I wonder sometimes, in fearful mood,
If that Spanish dagger has tasted blood,
And then (so dark are these nights.of rain!)
If that Spanish dagger will taste again.
QUEENSLAND.

When father got the hand-painted slippers

not intended for the ears of the well
meaning donor.
Father has been hoping that someone
would have the “gumption” to send him
an Qnoto pen, so as to make easier the
task of putting into diplomatic language
his letters of “thanks” to those who
“ remembered” him at Christmas.

To fill an Onoto one simply withdraws
the “ head,” dips the nib into the ink,
presses back the “head,”and the Onoto
is filled. No need of a filler. And no
fear of leakage after the Onoto is filled.
A simple turn of the “head” renders
the Onoto a sealed tube. Even if carried
upside down in the pocket, an Onoto will
never leak a drop.
