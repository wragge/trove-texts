ShaveX
New
Way:
Smear lightly
over face
Is it not strange that for hundreds of
years man has been scrubbing his face
with soaps containing soda, and has never
reasoned that under such treatment the
skin may suffer> Nothing is more ugly
than a face that looks raw. Shaving
soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered SHAVEX,
the natural method, where no brush and
soaps containing soda are needed.
FREE SAMPLE!
One can shave with Shavex in half the
time, and you will get’ a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had,
and shaving will become a pleasure. Your
skin will look and feel like satin, and
your face under this treatment will look
twice as young. No after lotions are
required when using Shavex, for it is a
skin food as well.

FOOD
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and fia«
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson's Eumet-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Red Page
A Dark Night at Whitton
A restless mood was on him, and Henry
Lawson suggested that, as I had never yet
been to Whitton, we should ■*, make a trip
there. I hesitated, for the old horse Peter
was not in condition, and, I knew the roads
were bad. But Henry argued—we need only
take Peter as far as Jack MoCausland’s, and
Jack’s slap-dash team would run us in and
back again in two or three hours. So I gave
in, and we jogged out to Jack’s place on
the following Saturday. Henry had little
to say, and sat limply, his hands idle before
him, and his head wagging this way and that
with the jolting of the sulky; but he stiff-
ened up abruptly and asked: “When you
first went out in the world, Jim, how did you
get on about table manners and all that?”
I was taken aback at the suddenness of the
question, and it was so unlike Lawson to
ask such things; but I replied: “Oh, I knew
a bit, and what I didn’t know I bluffed —or
fancied I did.” “Ah,” he said gloomily, “I
never could bluff.”
Jack’s slap-dash team was not at home, so
we decided to chance it with the old horse;
and although rain caught us on the way,
and the wheels picked up the mud till they
looked like balloon tyres, he pulled us
through. We were only able to travel at a
snail’s pace, and Henry beguiled the time by
telling us some of his experiences in Eng-
land. One was of his private meeting with
the late King Edward. “I was a bit flurried,”
he said, “and all I remembered after was a
good hearty handshake, and ‘How d’ do, Mr.
Lawson? Pleased to meet you. Have a
cigar, Mr. Lawson?’ then a word or two that
I could not hear, another handshake, and it
was over.” He was in talking humor —he
even laughed aloud, an unusual thing for
him—and although, as I said, we travelled
slowly, it did not seem very long before we
saw the lights of the little town. Then we
realised that we had no chance of returning
that night. As we were about to have a
drink, Henry grasped my hand and shook
it vigorously. In answer to my inquiry why
this sudden demonstration, he exclaimed:
“Our first drink together at a bar for 30
years!”
After tea he stayed with the publican’s
children in the dining-room. They had auto-
graph-books for him to “write something in,”
and verses and stories that he had written,
and they wanted to know all about this
one and that one, and was So-and-so a really
man or was it just Mr. Lawson himself?
Later, as I peeped in and saw his long grey-
ing hair tousled, and his face smiling, and
saw the enraptured faces of the little bush
children,. I knew that Henry was happy; I
knew, too, that those children would remem-
ber that hour for many a year. After a
while some well-dressed commercial travel-
lers entered the room, and that broke the
spell; Henry left suddenly, and, I fancy,
almost rudely, joining us on the verandah.
As we stood talking, I mentioned that
since we had been in the place I had not
heard a woman laugh—had not even seen
one smile ; and as he made no comment I
thought he hadn’t noticed my remark. But
he heard it all right, and remembered it.
We went round to the stable to see how old
Peter was faring, and, although Jack and I
were quite satisfied, Henry insisted on offer-
ing the horse a drink from a bucket, and
then rubbed him briskly over with a handful
of straw.
Coming down early next morning we were
surprised to see a man in singlet and trous-
ers boxing with an imaginary opponent. This
- way and that he lunged and struck, and his
footwork was neat. As we moved up closer
we were shocked to see that his eyes were
sightless, and that, although he had a boy’s
form, his face was that of a middle-aged
man. Then we learnt the story. Tears be-
fore he had been a promising boxer, and had
been matched to meet a travelling champion.
The bout was a short one. for almost at the
first hit the boy floundered, striking his head
heavily. He never saw again ; yet he never
lost his love for the game, and had his morn-
ing spar as regularly as he had his breakfast.
The tragedy of it affected Henry deeply, and
he spoke of it the last time we met, six
years later.
Before breakfast we went for a stroll
round the little town ; and as we halted at
an old blacksmith’s shop, a worn-out bullock-
waggon and the remains of an old mail-coach
seemed to make appeal to Henry. I saw
him affectionately fingering the well-worn
iron tyres, and as he rubbed his hand across
the cracked paint of the old coach he re-
marked : “I used to be pretty good at this
sort of thing—and this, too,” pointing to the
scroll-work and fine lining; and he shaped
his hands as if holding a brush, and drew
it deftly up and down and in and out. After
that we found ourselves on the common, and
close by was a rubbish-dump. - “You can
always mark the rise and fall of a bush
town by its rubbish-tip,” Henry said.
“Further out you’ll find oyster-shells and
champagne bottles; but as the people get
poorer and tireder the rubbish gradually
creeps right in, as it is here, and we see only
sardine-tins and old boots.” Just then a big
flock of goats trotted out of some scrub, and
he grabbed my hand as he had done in the
bar the previous evening. “What for?” I
asked. > “The last flock of goats we saw,”
he said, “was out at Hungerford, on the
Queensland border, in the days when the billy
boiled.”.
When we got back again at the hotel, every
girl or woman we met was either smiling or
laughing. I remarked on this. “Yes,” Henry
said. “I told some of ’em what you said
last night, and I suppose they’ve passed it
on to the others.”
When we were a mile or so on the home-
ward road I mentioned that old Peter seemed
pretty lively, due perhaps to the fact that
I had given the groom a couple of shillings
the night before. Jack looked up sharply
and said: “Why, I gave him half a crown
just 1 before I went to bed.” And Henry,
who had heard only part of what we had
said, broke in with: “Don’t worry about the
groom ; I gave him two bob last night. It
always pays to tip ’em the night before—
and you mightn’t be able to rip ’em in the
morning, anyhow.”
A cold, bleak wind was blowing, and as
we crossed a hungry-looking plain we came
to a camp, temporarily deserted but for a
kangaroo-dog, chained and shivering at a
shelterless stump. Jack and I were for pusb-
ing.on past the dismal-looking spot, but Henry
jumped out, dragged an upturned box to
the windy side, gathered some empty chaff-
bags and placed them for the dog to lie on.
At the next gate Jack’s trap met us and
carried him off, for his people were no doubt
worried at his absence; and then we realised
that our own people might be anxious, too.
So I whipped up old Peter, while Henry
recited:
The long, long shadows of the old bay horse
By the track on the red-soil plain.
JIM GRAHAME.
This Worth-while Life of Ours
Mr. Ellery lately painted on the Red Page
a Job-like picture of disillusioned humanity
sitting among the ashes of its ancient gods
and knowing not whither to turn for comfort.
But is there not a possibility that humanity
is like a young person who has discovered
that there is no Santa Claus and no fairies
and that the time for shifting responsibili-
ties is past? Having awakened from his
dream of pie in the sky, man is left without
an anaesthetic to ease the pangs of existence.
But given time to dry his tears and readjust
his outlook, he will conform to the new order
and very sensibly decide that this life at
least is his and that it is of more import-
ance to do his bit and get on with it than
to determine whether his immortality shall
be a geographical heaven with de luxe fur-
nishings, or simply the indestructibility of
whatever contributions he has made to the
universal stock of absolute values —truth,
goodness and beauty. To a child the reward
of virtue may well be a lollypop, but a man
is content to know the peace of soul which
follows upon work well done; the game is
worth the candle.
Disillusionment was the first result of the
shock to man’s vanity occasioned by the
revelations of science concerning his origin;
but reflection must make it apparent to the
thinking man that science has also given to
him a higher, fresher hope than any ever
vouchsafed him by revealed religion. • The
old order has been reversed; man, instead of
having come perfect and unspotted from his
Maker and of conscious choice fallen into
sin, knows himself but lately emerged from
the beast to stand upright and face the light.
From the Hebraic conception of man made
in God’s own image much might have been
expected; but even admitting the blood-
stained pages of history, man has not done
so badly in the short 30,000 years since
he slunk about the earth a hairy beast, sur-
viving only by the cunning of his dawning
intelligence. The list of his mistakes is
discouraging at first sight, but when we con-
sider the prodigality of Nature, which
spawns a million men content to exist for
one who cannot live without thinking and
questioning, we must realise that progress is
bound to be a long business, with many
wrong turnings and many baekslidings. The
work of the world is done by so few, carry-
ing the dead weight of human stupidity on
their backs. Our thinkers and prophets be-
ing themselves but men newly evolved from
the unthinking beast, it is inevitable that
the grains of truth which they bring us
should be cumbered about with useless lum-
ber and that their sheeplike fellows, accept-
ing the truth, will often cling more tenaci-
ously to the error in which it is enveloped.
But the hope of earth and our only real pro-
gress lies in the fact that each succeeding
ideal which we embrace contains its modi-
cum of truth which becomes the permanent
possession of the race. All things are still
possible. Science has promised the old earth
some millions of years of life still to run,
and, while we have no assurance that man
will continue to inhabit the globe during
that time, the probabilities are that the
human race too has only entered on its first
lap. ,
Mr. Ellery’s plea for a philosophy of life
is, after all, but a renewal of the old child-
like cry “Lord, show us a sign.” The thinker
needs no philosophy of life beyond the fact
that life is a riddle and man a seeker after
truth. A universe with its riddle solved
would be a universe finished and done and
devoid of interest. The thinker, looking
upon life reduced to absolute order and
brought entirely within the scope of his
understanding, would be in the position of
a child who had mastered its primer and
been given nothing, further upon which to
feed its growing intelligence. When the
universe is understandable it will be time to
pass on to a new order. But depend upon
it, if there is any personal immortality for
us, it will be no state of everlasting bliss
and futile ease and plenty. It will be rather
a setting of other and stiffen problems com-
pared with which our present perplexities
will be as a kindergarten child’s mess of
painted sticks and straws. Life without a
constant growing and stretching of the in-
tellect would be so puerile and futile a
thing that it were better for us had we re-
mained for ever that conscious clot in
primeval slime which Mr. Ellery has so pic-
turesquely described as our beginning.
There is no magic key which will, unlock
the mysteries of life. We shall continue as
we have begun to add little truth to little
truth, constantly revising and rejecting the
seeming truths of yesterday. Since the goal
towards which men strive changes with their
mental growth, no ideal other than the
search for truth can hope, for permanency.
Each age follows its own star, and the suc-
ceeding age points the falsities and errors
of that upon which its forebears set their
hearts, just as thinking men are now be-
ginning to question the unalloyed advan-
tages of the industrial expansion which to
the last century was law and gospel. Pos-
terity will build for itself a new ideal which
will give way in its turn. Prophets and
teachers will continue to differ and pull tins
wav and that, and Some will reason without

heart and some will sentimentalise without
reason, but the search for truth will go on
for ever. “The only question which any
wise man will ask himself,” said Huxley,
“is whether a doctrine is true or false. Con-
sequences will take care of themselves; at
most their importance can only justify us
in testing with extra care the reasoning pro-
cesses from which they result.”
But it must be apparent that we shall
never know “a collective idea which will find
universal acceptance” until the riddle of the
universe is solved and truth made whole.
I'util then truth will continue to be revealed
in homoeopathic doses as the world is able to
bear it. It is for us only to apply the trifle
of knowledge which is our portion towards
the solution of our present-day problems,
keeping an open mind tlie while for new
revelations of truth. To quote Huxley
again: “We live in a world which is full
of misery and ignorance, and the plain
duty of each and all of us is to try to
make the little corner he can influence
somewhat less miserable and somewhat
less ignorant than it was before he
entered it. To do this effectually, it is
necessary to be fully possessed of only two
beliefs: first, that the order of Nature is
ascertainable by our faculties to an extent
that is practically unlimited; the second
that our own volition counts for something
as a condition of the course of events.”
The brightest hope of our time lies in
our growing ability, to recognise our mis-
takes within an appreciable period, and for
this blessing statistics are largely respon-
sible. An evil recognised is an evil in the
way of being cured, and we have every right
to hope that the world will at some not too
distant date, as time goes, count over-popu-
lation, the breeding of degenerates, war and
present-day diseases of the physical body
and the body politic among the number of
its past errors and follies, just as it now
counts human slavery, religious intolerance,
child labor, the burning of witches and the
flogging of lunatics.
Surely the best proof that thinking man
does not utterly desnair of this world in
which he lives is the fact that lie is willing
to allow his children to take their chance in
it. Could thoughtful, conscientious humans
continue to beget their kind convinced that
nought but vanity and disillusionment
awaited them? It is because man knows in
his heart of hearts, howsoever he may rail
at fate, that life with all its problems and
perplexities, indeed because of these very
things, is gloriously worth the living that
lie is content to let his son have bis day.
MARY SCOTT.
Tolerance and Fear
To breathe pulsing life into the pages of
history and bring before his readers an
image sharply cut and vivid in color is a gift
from the gods to Hendrik Willem Van Loon.
There is no other modern writer who does
this work in the same fashion ; casting aside
all the love for minutise that dogs the pen
of the ultra-faithful historian, he lays a
hand upon the roughly-defined body and
swiftly gets to the centre of vitality. It is
thus history teaches, not by its diaried events
but by its total of significance. In The
Liberation of Mankind (Ilarrap) he tells
the story of man’s struggle for the right to
think. It is a volume dedicated to the sub-
ject of tolerance, basing upon the posses-
sion of that quality all hopes of humanity
to reach its highest potentiality.
Intolerance is the child of fear. Primi-
tive society knitted its members together by a
rigid system of intolerance—compassed them
about by taboos founded on a fear of the
vengeance of unseen powers. By this means
the community was held in a network of
common observances. Tolerance meant a dis-
ruptive force, andVanLoon is able to trace'the
spirit of hostility against the free expression
of individual opinion and the exercise of in-
dividual will down all the centuries. It
expressed itself practically in all social, reli-
gious and political forms, being as much a
root principle in the terror of the French
Revolution as it had been when Socrates
drank the hemlock. The Christian, at first
the victim of intolerance, in time became its
protagonist. At the bottom of all lurked
fear that any deviation from the beaten path,
the accepted routine and the communal reli-
gion would bring disaster. Organised
society placed the continued safety of the
group first of all considerations, and viewed
with suspicion the attempts of individual
minds to change or even modify existing laws
lest with change should come disaster. But
down the centuries the writer follows the
effects of the Renaissance, the Reformation,
the printing press, the influences of Eras-
mus, Rabelais, Montaigne, Spinoza, Voltaire,
Lessing and others upon the widening out
of the spirit of a growing tolerance. Never-
theless, intolerance still survives; it may
change its aspect, but it remains a terribly
effective cause of unhappiness. Till 12 years
ago, in the minds of most people, it was
almost exclusively identified with the idea of
religious intolerance. Then came the war,
“and a society which was just beginning to
rid itself of the horrors of religious bigotry
was obliged to put up with the infinitely
more painful manifestations of a paltry form
of racial intolerance, the existence of which
had not even been suspected.”
But Van Loon is no pessimist. In his
assay of life fear lies at the bottom of the
crucible; “life which might be a glorious
adventure is turned into a horrible experi-
ence, and all this happens because human
existence so far has been entirely dominated
by fear.” Man, once ridded of the spectre
of fear, is strongly inclined to be righteous
and just. “Thus far, he has had very few
< pportunities to practise these two virtues.
But the race is young, almost ridiculously
young. To ask that a certain form of mam-
mal which began its independent career only
a few thousand years ago should already
have acquired those virtues which go only
with age and experience seems both unrea-
sonable and unfair. And, furthermore, it
warps our point of view. It causes us to
be irritated when we should be patient. It
makes us say harsh things where we should
onlv feel pity.”
\an Loon’s optimism is long-dated, and
readers would doubtless rise more satisfied
from this interesting and witty book if the
prophetic utterance had fixed a day more
clearly within his vision. Just possibly fear
may be a necessary stimulus to effort, and
its funeral dirge might be the song of the
lotos-eater.
T. B. C.
The Poilu in Literature
Tile client war atuieu tne glamor of per-
sonal sacrifice to French letters in the deaths
of Charles Peguy and his young disciple
Ernest Psichari, the latter a grandson of
Renan. The sense of involvement of the
literary profession of France in the war
was greater than that of the profession in
England. Our ally both lost and gamed
more in literature than we did. Barbusse s
“Under Fire” still remains, eight years after
the Armistice, the most significant book ot
personal experience which has emerged from
the struggle. England has had its Phiap
Gibbs, whose tender humanity was sincerely
stirred by things seen but not experienced;
its Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves, in
whom the reactions of public-school youth
were explicit; and the writer of “The Span-
ish Farm,” honest but limited, intrigued in
the weaving of his hero’s illicit romance
(under pressure of extraordinary circum-
stances) with the daughter of the French
farm proprietor. But no one has transfixed
the nightmarish thing, simply and directly,
as Henri Barbusse did in that simple story
of a squad.
Peguy and Psichari met traditionally
glorious deaths early in the first year of
war. We had our Rupert Brooke dying
romantically at the gates of Hellas, beneath
the very cliffs whence Sappho gazed to the
se.a and its /Egean blueness, and his sacrifice
was not less because he was the victim of
illness beyond the actual range of glory in
the military sense. But in the death of
Peguy, killed illustriously at the head of
his men during that first Battle of the Marne,
displaying inspired bravery, there is some-
thing enormously and overwhelmingly fit.
It seems natural that in France, the country
of Napoleon and Dreyfus, the military tradi-
tion should become audible through its liter-
ature. To Peguy the essence of military
virtue was love of country. But what
strange folk they are, these Frenchmen,
capable of tenacious idealism which we in
Australia might well contemplate and strive
to comprehend! How different from that
light-headed glutton for physical love which
was the only type of Frenchman so many
of us could imagine before the war ! Like
Francis Jammes, Peguy became a convert
to the Roman Catholic Church. An ardent
socialist and radical during early manhood,
he came to conceive the Church, all envel-
oping and all understanding, as the ideal
social administrator, and transferred his
allegiance to it as the more direct medium
for the realisation of his ideals. Doubtless
he found also that deep personal satisfac-
tion, that relief of individual renunciation,
which many Frenchmen of this century have
re-found in the faith of their fathers. Peguy
had ample precedent for his conversion in
the history of French literature, at any rate
of the nineteenth century. To us, in Austra-
lia at least, the type is practically unknown.
Perhaps the climate is against the breeding
of mystics in whose lofty idealism so many
of the younger generation might find inspira
tion. .
Not the least interesting aspect of these
men is their influence on the younger men.
How well our Australian politics might
benefit by the example of a Barres, our world
of art by a Peguy or a Claudel! Not a
mysticism of obscurity they boast, these re-
actionaries to discipline and faith, but a lofty
idealism of pure, unselfish motives in which
the keynote is ever personal service and
sacrifice. Their influence in France is easy
to understand where the younger genera-
tions of serious mind and purpose have found
in faith and discipline the qualities at once
most neglected and most necessary in their
country filled with ghastly confusion and
instability.
The case of Ernest Psichari illustrates the
directness of appeal, although his conversion
dates from before the war. The grandson of
Renan reverses in the third generation the
apostasy of his grandfather. An ideal of
impersonal service takes the place of that
desire for individual satisfaction and justi-
fication in a rational and scientific regard
for truth. From the centre of a circle com-
posed of ancient Dreyfusards and rational-
ists of a most ardent order, the young man
goes forth to embrace the Church and the
Army. Into their hands he resigns his ques-
tioning self and liis energies, seeing salva-
tion and solution in this new-found ideal of
service. Two generations of reasoning have
convinced him of the need for action. It is
consistent with the ideal that it should find
expression in military service. The Army
implies that authority from winch there
could be no dissent. In France one feels the
outlook on military service to be different
from, say, that in England, where it is a
job like other jobs, and where few ever ex-
pect to have to practise it to the extent of
anything more arduous than a term in India.
That, at least, must have been the outlook
at the time of Psichari’s conversion, before
the war, whatever changes have taken place
since. But in France the menace from across
the border, ever since that disaster of 1870,
has been present, by no means the remote
contingency it must have been to the aver-
age Britisher before 1914. So it seems per-
fectly natural that Psichari’s new-found ideal
should find its translation in terms of army
service and its terrible but logical con-
clusion in the great struggle. _ After service
at home and in North Africa as a non-
commissioned officer, hc_ returned and entered
a school for officers in obedience to his
mother’s wishes, whence he graduated not
long before the bugles sounded for the great
struggle. He was killed during the retreat
from Charleroi after a terrible day of fight-
ing to cover the retirement of the main army,
and his eyes closed on still advancing, hordes
of grey-clad enemy, a fresh host which for
one tense moment they had vainly hoped
was reinforcements.
It is a pity there are not translations
easily to be had of these men’s works. They
stood for something we sorely need in Aus
tralia. Having given so generously, so ter-
ribly generously, for a young country, one
is yet fearful that the precious lesson may
slip from us. These men could help us to
comprehend it.
BASIL BURDETT.
The Short Story—and Cronin
From the tangle of a mind somewhat
choked by over-reading the short story in
Australia, one scarlet thread seems to pull
clear from the rest —the dramatic brevity of
Bernard Cronin. Much of his stuff; I
have no doubt missed, it being impossible
to read everything. But I have been follow-
ing The Bulletin for many years, and do
not hesitate to say that the cream of Cronin’s
mind has been tinned for it. The thinner
stuff has run all over Australia, but it is
with his concentrated essence that I am con-
cerned here.
I have read his novels, and like them.
They have a vitality and a simplicity of
morals refreshing to those overloaded with
the super-analytical and sexually intricate
literature of our day. His main fault, which
he holds in common with Masefield, is a
manifest wish to thrust his women into the
far corner so that his men may have room
to walk. But it is through the medium of
his two- and three-thousand-word miniatures
that he reaches the fine point of his art. Of
these pictures three spring to my memory—
“ The Ultimate Factor,” the dramatic “Scar-
let Knot,” the subtle “Quality of Hate”—
representing the three edges of his brain. He
has all the essentials of the short-story
writer —the sense of climax, the lean style
and a construction like the clear finish of
a circle, end joined to end. No waste, no
tags, no confusion, no meandering or hurry-
ing. Plots that run straight from their birth
to their completion with a rare dramatic
ease. He has, furthermore, a gift of meta-
phor often denied to, or ignored by, short-
story writers—-for example, De Maupassant
and O. Henry. In the. briefest of his sketches,
ill the midst of the sharpest action, he will
find time to pause and capture in a carveri
phrase the sound of the darkness, the sweep
of a girl’s hair, the curve of the sky at night.
Where Maupassant will take a woman’s face
and describe it laboriously, feature by fea-
ture, Cronin will say in a single line that
“she had the slow beauty of a cameo.”
Where O. Henry will describe with vigor
and interest and an abundance of Ameri-
eanese a flight across a prairie, the other
will merely remark; “He shot from the
mouth of the alley, a wedge of furious action
driven into the face of the odorous night.”
Judging by his rapid output, Cronin should
by this time have been able to collect at
least two books of excellent stories; one, the
psychological and sombrely dramatic, the
other the adventurous and outdoor. I know
the public, for some obscure reason, prefers
to take its short story in magazine form
rather than from a bound book. But it is
also true that innumerable books of this
order do appear and prosper—many of them
inferior to that which this writer, if he took
the trouble, would be able, to collect. I recog-
nise that, the implied suggestion may be re-
garded as an impertinence. But it surely
cannot give any writer annoyance to know
that a section of the public is waiting fo"
something more from him —something which
will stamp him not. so much as the vigorous,
P°P ular . novelist as the acutely sensitive,
knife-minded creator of Silhouette.

A Satchel of Books
Seven Champions of Christendom, by Richard
Joh,lson . (Blackie). Apart from its intrinsic merits,
mteresting as an example of a “best seller” in the
early / ears ° f , th e seventeenth century It is a
rc P ri »t .of a book published m 1861 which contained
an abridgment of Johnson’s original work, itself
a compilation from some of the more notable of the
chivalric romances of Arthurian days. The book is
illustrated well, if not profusely,
The Questing Mind, by Alan D. Mickle (Andrew
Melrose). Bulletin readers will feel a personal
interest in the success of this volume of essays by
a man whose signature appears so often on the Red
Page. Though the book is published in England,
the greater part of its contents were written in
Aus tralia and very largely reflect its frank and
open-air outlook. The essays range over a wide
expanse of sub jeets, from “The Dog” to “Man and
God.” are treated with genial commonsense,
and show at the same time a genuine appreciation of
natural beauty and a keen sympathy with life,
Mr. Pepys, by Clifford Bax (Heinemann). To
p U t the immortal diarist into the setting of a ballad
opera was what he himself might have described as
“ a merry conceit.” Samuel’s love of amorous ad-
venture coupled with the marital discipline of Mrs.
Pepys gives a leading motive to the play, in which
N<? 9 Owvnn and a host of “gallant rakes and
P retty ro B ues make up a diverting company. But
Pepys take „ out of the leaves 0 f his diary is not
j be g amue i the reader knows. He loses sadly by
transmutation.
Romanticism, by Shirley L. Fox (E. A. Vidlor).
Romanticism, according to the writer of this thought-
ful though brief review, “is a temperamental dis-
position fundamental to all human nature, usually
appearing in relief as a foil to an opposite, less
lovely, and mtellectualism that needed stern but
sympathetic correction. Romance beautifies its sur-
roundings, invigorating and giving new life to all
that can absorb its vitality.” He traces its develop-
ment from the classic age through the early days of
Christianity and the mediaeval period to modern
times, and indicates its methods of expression in
literature, the graphic arts and music. The matter
j s be ttev than the manner.

THESE are days when the public hardly knows what to
expect in the matter of car prices.
So consistent and lavish are the price reductions featured in the
daily press that they are apt to rather upset the calculations of
the intending purchaser, but the climax has lately been reached
by the astounding announcement that the world-famous
OVERLAND FOUR had been redued to £lB5.
At £lB5, fully equipped with high-grade body, cord tyres,
black hood, duco finish, speedometer, etc., this car attains a
standard of value which marks it as being easily “most car
for the m6ney in Australia.”
Thousands of these cars on the roads of this State to-day are
offering undeniable evidence of the capacity of the OVERLAND
to stand all the gruelling of Australian road conditions and come
up for more.

Chance strayers, strolling in the night,
Through wide-flung windows see
Sweet women in the room's rose-light
With arms like ivory.
With golden gear on wrists and necks
’Neath tinted lamps they glide,
While pearly dew, moonlit, bedecks
The gleaming lawn outside.
As thus they dance, dance on, I vow,
Their lit eyes dance as well;
Till now the music ends, and now
Bright talk and laughter swell.
Out-issuing, outflowing there
From lips and eyes a-smile,
Light talk and laughter fill the air
A golden moment’s while.
And now they rise, and now begin
To tread again the floor,
As luring them the violin
Pours forth its spell once more.
In tone, in time to rhythmic sound,
Their light feet rise and fall;
To-night for them the world rolls round
As it should roll for all.

Desire.
Perchance it is better to fail
If the striving be true.
Who knows in the infinite scale
If our deeds or our dreams shall avail?
Who should say it were well if we came
To our city of tremulous flame,
Where the sky is so crystalline blue,
That God’s laughter gleams through?
Ay, haply ’tis better to lose
So one dream shall keep faith
In our hearts that the bitter fates bruise.
At the crossroads of darkness we choose
Of dim ways that are barren and blind;
And who knows of its soul shall it find
In each far shadow’s wavering wraith
Or splendor or scaith?
Mate o’ mine, the far ultimate shore
We never attain;
Yet. till chaos creeps dreamless and frore,
And the tribe of the stars is no more,
We will strive and keep faith with one dream
Through the dark that has never a gleam.
Recking not, though our loss were our
gain,
While the quest shall remain!

Betrayed.
Here we have built on unsubstantial earth
Vain temples to high hope wherein we pray
Love may outlive the evening of our day,
Though we be mortals and of little worth.
Our toil is tragic; yet a wage of mirth
We make demand upon the years to pay,
Trusting blind chance to point an un-
kenned way
To some felicity through second birth.
The soft hypnotic fleetness of earth’s roll.
Shy gloaming pregnant to the gipsy night,
The winsome mildness of our summer morns,
Seduce to alien bowers the human soul,
Even like the white bull Jupiter in flight
With raped Europa clinging to his horns.

DARIUS.
The White Road.
The sky is clear and cloudless, a bright and
arching blue —
The same tint as the satin bow upon my
lady’s shoe.
The trees are ships becalmed upon the green
wave of the hills,
As though each bough were waiting till the
canvas strains and fills.
North-westward loom the ranges in deepest
purple drest,
With sloping, wooded ridges leaning close
against their breast,
While past them glides the Liffey in its set-
ting of tree-fern,
Where the lordly eagle drinks his fill beside
the foaming burn.
And northward runs the roadway—a white
road and a wide—
With peppermint and euealypt upon each
grassy side.
I’ve trod it in the spring-time with my heart
athrill with song,
For the flowers bloom in thousands there
among the kurrajong.
Heath, pink and white and ivory, and some
with blood-red bells
That glow like rosy lanterns within the elfin
fells,
And eglantine and Aaron’s rod, while soft
clematis stars
Gleam pale against the wattle’s bole or smile
through bracken bars.
’Tis there the whispering wattles dance and
steal your heart away,
And lure you close and drug you with their
scented, golden spray,
While round their feet a carpet spreads of
violets white and blue —
Bush violets, shy and drowsy-eyed, and sweet
as lioney-dew.
And, oh, I love the white road, the long
road and best!
It calls me, ever calls me, and will not let
me rest.
At dawning it shall lead me where the brown
cicada drums,
While the Sun god in his glory sets aflame
the waiting gums.

THE CITY STATES WE SHOULD
HAVE.
The effort made in Australia to put into
five cities and their suburbs a working major-
ity of the continent's population, and the
promise that the effort will be more than
a success, and the present and future con-
sequences thereof, have built up a problem
which piles so much higher every day that
it already amounts to a skyscraper. It was
remarked even 40 years ago that something
was out of focus, but in those days the idea
of a capital wholly overshadowing the rest
of the big State hadn’t begun to be really
contemplated. The first case of the kind,
that of Adelaide, developed about 1913, and
that of Melbourne in 1917. As a matter of
fact, a census would probably show that
every mainland metropolis, with a few
adjacent townlets that are really part of it,
stands for more than half its State, but in
the two cases quoted it isn’t necessary to
reckon adjacent townlets, the metropolis
being a good majority by itself. Sydney and
its environs rule N. S. Wales, and five or
six years ago a city and suburban Ministry,
in its ignorance of things not city and subur-
ban, produced a bill for a general seizure
of privately-owned country lands, to be paid
for pretty much at its own valuation (bar-
ring some improvements which were to be con-
fiscated), payment to be made with hundred-
weights of long-dated and low-interest-bearing
paper. The property was then to be put on the
market, on the nearest approach to cash
terms that could be arranged. The uproar
which caused the scheme to be dropped arose
in a measure because no provision was made
for the mortgagee, who hadn’t bargained to
have his claims met with depreciated paper;
and the mortgagee, being partly English,
was liable to roar in England, and disturb
the next loan. A duplicate Sydney and
suburban Ministry, with the Land Bill
gentleman of a few years back at the head
of it and not improved by age, has put in
force a Workmen’s Compensation law,
which smote country industries hard enough
to throw 20,000 men out of work almost on
the same day. Being what it is, other and
possibly worse things may happen. In Vic-
toria the country rules instead of the one
big city, thus reversing the N. S. Wales
position. This is because the country has
almost twice as many representatives as it
would be entitled to on a population basis,
among them being Allan and Peacock, the
twin heads of the Allancock Cabinet. But
now the metropolis demands, or the Age
demands' for it, a “fair deal” that would
give Melbourne seven more votes than all
the rest of Victoria, with a prospect, if the
centralisation process continues, of 17 more
votes, and later of nearly all the votes. Pre-
mier Allan says that re-adjustment on a
purely population basis is impossible; but
Allan is impossible himself, and still he
exists. He is struggling after some kind of
compromise by which two will be taken from
six and added to three, and the six and
the three will remain as before. The odds
are against him.
* * * *
The most obvious remedy is to get the
movement for the subdivision of unmanage-
able areas (if it is movable enough to be
really a movement) going on a different
basis. There is need for the cutting of cer-
tain States into two pieces to begin with —
one the existing metropolis, including its
suburbs, which would be its own capital,
and the other the rest of the State, which
would proceed to establish a new capital.
Further subdivision of the rest of the State
would probably (in some cases certainly) be
advisable later on. The immediate matter
is not, then, that Riverina or New England
should separate, but that 99 per- cent, or
more of N. S. Wales should secede as an
introductory measure, leaving Sydney the
commercial and industrial City State which
is its natural destiny. Of the salaried Lower
House members of the Cabinet three-fifths
hail, or lately hailed, from industrial regions
of the Botany and Pyrmont variety. If the
jurisdiction of such a Ministry ended some
little way beyond Parramatta on the west
and a similar distance north and south, then
it might be dealing with problems which it
understood more or less. But when it man-
ages or mismanages a region outside the
city and suburban radius which is 50 per
cent, larger than Germany before the war
and which has little voice in affairs through
lack of population, the street-bred Govern-
ment develops an uncanny habit of smash-
ing things. A list of the best-known city
States of the world, to which Sydney, Adel-
aide and Melbourne might be added with
advantage, makes an impressive show, with
the N. S. Wales capital put in by way of
comparison:—

The estimate of the population of Sydney
and sufficient surroundings to make up 700
square miles is that of 1923. It is an aston-
ishing thing that by far the newest place on
the above list, and the political centre of a
mere 2£ million inhabitants, should be able
to take fourth place among the world’s city
States, but other circumstances are almost
as remarkable. Melbourne, for instance,
would come between Hamburg and Mexico,
and Adelaide, Brisbane, and even Perth, close
after Bremen. Australia grows big towns
fast enough, however thin the country may
be. and already dense spots begin* to be
noticeable. If the City State of Sydney was
limited to 185 sq. miles, which would make
it correspond fairly well with Hamburg, it
would average 5818 inhabitants to each mile
at latest figures. Old Hamburg may be 1117
years of age, but it doesn’t beat new Sydney
by much for close packing.

Australia is a land of quaint and pig-
headed illusions, many of them middle-class
illusions, and one concerns the expense and
danger of altering the subdivisions which
British convict-time rulers left us. Grotesque
ideas are held about the cost of the coun-
try’s seven Governments, which really only
run in a year to about half Premier Lang’s
deficit, or just about the projected outlay
on the Sydney Municipal Council’s Park-
street resumptions. As for the danger, it
is hard to define and is a purely local bogey.
Irt this connection some British examples
may be quoted :

In the United States there are six States
with less than 10,000 square miles of area
(one of them has only 1067), and there is
also a large one with less than 78.000 popu-
lation, which is far below even Tasmania’s
census record. By comparison, the rest of
N. S. Wales and Victoria, after Sydney and
Melbourne were set up for themselves,
would measure over 305.000 and 85.000
square miles respectively. And even
the rest of Victoria would have more
inhabitants to start with than 14 of
the United States, for Uncle has cut his
self-governing areas very fine in places. The
severed country districts in both States
would begin to fill up promptly. The
number of people who would start new busi-
nesses or remove old ones far enough north
and south and west to be out of the Lang-
McTiernan-McKell jurisdiction would be
a revelation.
THE CASE FOR GREATER FEDERAL
INDUSTRIAL POWERS.
The most important of the proposed Con-
stitutional amendments which are to be put
before the people on September 4 relates to
paragraph XXXV of Section 51 —“Concilia-
tion and arbitration for the prevention and
settlement of industrial disputes extending
beyond the limits of any one State.” If the
referendum only resulted in the last eight
words being struck out of the Constitution,
the expense would be returned to the people
a hundredfold. “Every letter in those eight
words,” says Scullin, Labor M.H.R. for
Yarra, “has cost our trade-unions £lOOO in
unnecessary litigation, not as to the merits
of disputes submitted to the Federal Arbitra-
tion Court, but as to whether the cases
should have been submitted to it at all.”
And in the long run all the parties to this
“unnecessary litigation,” which has certainly
been enormously costly on both sides, have
been losers. The High Court has ruled that
there cannot be a dispute within the mean-
ing of paragraph XXXV unless every em-
ployer sought to be bound by an award is
dragged in. As a result, a federated union
has to serve processes on thousands of em-
ployers, some of whom may be paying more
than the organisation hopes to get for its
one or more dissatisfied branches, but are
included because it can’t be helped. In a
recent case quoted by Attorney-General
Latham, printed copies of a bulky log were
sent to 5000 employers in several States,
postage alone costing 44d. a letter. Then
there had to be a conference so that the
parties might formally refer the matter to
the Court. Then came service of the Court’s
order on the respondents, the hearing (at
which every one of the 5000 employers could
put his case personally), reading of the
minutes of the award, and delivery of that
judgment in its final shape. And the award
does not bind an employer who was not
named by the union, or who was named but
not served with proceedings, or 'who caine
into the industry after the award was
arrived at. The only w r ay of binding the
new employer, if he proves a bad employer,
is to manufacture a new dispute.
* •» * #
Numerous other exasperating anomalies
and impediments to industrial peace have
their origin in this limitation of Federal
powers. Some of them have been mentioned
by the Attorney-General, who can speak
from experience, and his remarks are here
summarised: —
Suppose the two sides in an industry meet, and
make an agreement as to the terms and conditions
under which that industry shall be carried on, that
agreement cannot be registered as an agreement, or
be made an award of the Arbitration Court, unless
the parties generate a dispute about it. If they
create a dispute, they can make an agreement to
settle that dispute; but, if they make the agreement
before they have the dispute, no legal effect can be
given to it by the Court.
The Commonwealth Parliament has no power to
legislate for the prevention and settlement of indus-
trial disputes. It can only legislate with respect to
conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and
settlement of certain industrial disputes. Therefore
it is impossible to establish Federal wages boards on
the Victorian plan, because wages boards act in-
dependently of the existence of disputes and their
procedure is vastly different from that imposed on
the Federal Court by the wording of paragraph
XXXV. But Federal wage boards, which might be
very useful in some industries, could be established
under the powers now sought.
If the wages paid in an industry are 14s. a day,
and a claim is made for 16s. a day, it is impossible
for the Arbitration Court to do anything but award
a rate between 14s. and 16s. If an award is made
for a three-yearly period, and if the cost of living
rises tremendously, the award rate cannot be varied
during that period above 165., although everyone
in the industry may agree that 17s. is a fair rate.
On the other hand, if the cost of living markedly
fell, so that 12s. was worth as much as 14s. previ-
ously, no variation could be below 14s. These
limitations, and innumerable others, are imposed by
the fatal word “disputes."’
There is also the confusion arising from a
plethora of awards, Federal and State. The
Sunshine harvester factory, for instance, em-
ploys 120 different kinds of workmen and has
to observe awards which prescribe hourly
and Aveekly rates, weekly and fortnightly
pays—weekly on Monday in some cases and
weekly on Friday in others —and half a
dozen ways of calculating overtime. These
provocative and wasteful conditions shriek
for the establishment of some co-ordinating
authority, but this is impossible while the
National Parliament remains shackled by
paragraph XXXV of Section 51.
* * * *
The industrial-powers amendments, if
carried, will not deprive the States of any of
their present powers or interfere with their
machinery for dealing with intra-State dis-
putes. Neither will it oblige every perplexed
or aggrieved section of the 300,000 unionists
working under Federal awards to go to
Canberra for an interpretation, a new log.
or anything of the kind, for devolution of
authority to local tribunals —which may be
arbitration courts, wages boards, conciliation
committees or Whitley councils, if agree-
able to the parties concerned —is expressly pro-
vided for. But if the majority of the people
says “Yes,” “the Serbonian bog of technicali-
ties” to which Justice Higgins referred long
ago, and of which Scullin and Latham
have given lamentable examples from a later
period, will disappear for ever. Also, the
way will be cleared for honest settlements
of vexed questions, such as hours of labor
—settlements arrived at by impartial pien
after consideration of all the facts, instead
of bargains made by politicians hungry for
votes. Bruce has been attacked for forcing
the referendum on the public at what is
alleged to be an unseasonable time. Really,
the referendum has been forced on Bruce
by mule-headed State meddling with the
national fiscal policy. The Greene tariff
is based on the 48-hour working week, and
the Pratten revision was_ framed in the ex-
pectation that the 48-hour week would con-
tinue, Along came Lang and Baddeley
with their 44-hour-week law, which immedi-
ately and substantially weakened the Prot c-
tion given to N. S. Wales manufacture
and the e\il consequences of which did no,
end with the settlement of the strike of
Federal award workers—if it was a settle-
ment. It is essential that industry depen-
dent on the tariff should be regulated by
the authority which makes the tariff, if there
is not to be incessant tinkering, and nobody
wants that. Tinkering would be ineffectual
in any case.
THE INSTITUTE OF PACIFIC
RELATIONS.
A small island in the Pacific lias recently
been made the theatre of a great experi-
ment. The delegates from eight countries
who met at Honolulu were animated by a
common purpose, that of substituting friend-
ship for force. As nearly one-half of the
human race live in countries bordering on
the Pacific, now the centre of political
gravity, such an event is fraught with deep
significance for the future of Australasia.
The leader of the Australian delegation
(Duncan Hall) called attention to the fact
that the Pacific, viewed from Honolulu, is
very different from the ocean gazed upon
by “stout Cortez” from “a peak in Darien.”
“Instead of a waste of waters separating con-
tinents and people, steamship, cable and
wireless have made them crowd upon one
another, and news crosses the water in a
fraction of a second. This shrinkage of the
Pacific enormously increases the complexity
of problems arising out of the contact of
different religions, cultures and economic sys-
wars.” To solve these difficulties in a
friendly spirit is the object of the Institute
and its conferences.
The way had been paved as early as 1916,
when a plan for a Pan-Pacific conference to
consider the human problems of this littoral
was formulated by the Y.M.C.A. The idea
was taken up by the professional and busi-
ness men of Honolulu, who viewed with con-
cern the increasing tension in the Pacific
area. From these small beginnings, hardly
noticed at the time, grew the plan of the
Institute of Pacific Relations for promoting
friendly relations between the peoples of this
region. Preparatory work was undertaken
by several national committees—notably by
Australia, China, Japan and the United
States. The course of study embraced pro-
blems of Imperialism in the Pacific, treat-
ment of Orientals in Western countries,
religious and cultural contacts, naval and
strategic problems, foreign relations of Paci-
fic _ countries, and other weighty matters.
With minds well furnished, the delegates met
“to ascertain,” writes Merle Davis in his
admirable report, “whether the common talk
of inevitable conflict between East and West
has a rational basis, whether economic co-
operation is a more powerful factor in
national relations than economic rivalry,
whether race difference is a liability or an
asset, and whether racial interdependence is
riot a more profitable formula for solving
international problems than racial anti-
pathy.”
The Institute deliberately broke nearly
every rule of conference procedure. Instead
of bringing together people with identical
beliefs and prejudices, it assembled men and
women with widely divergent convictions
and experiences. These included representa-
tives of labor and political bodies, the univer-
sities, the church, the press, commercial and
business interests, women's organisations and
social agencies—all determined to grapple
with the conflicting interests of the people
concerned. It was also unique in forming
no programme and passing no resolutions.
Its sole aim was to gain a clear understand-
ing of facts, talk them over in a leisurely
way and discover what each nation felt on
the matter. The topic fell into three
main divisions: (a) Problems involved in
migration and immigration; (6) problems
created by religious, ethical and cultural con-
tacts: (e) problems growing out of inter-
national, commercial and industrial contacts.
The discussions were carried on first at
round-table conferences for the intimate
study of a general topic; at “forums,” where
the whole Institute met to consider reports
from the round tables; and at open lectures.
Animated discussions were continued out-
side—in drawing- and music-rooms, in gar-
dens and tennis-courts—and those informal
talks produced the most lasting impression.
At the close of the two weeks members
could point to several real accomplishments.
It was abundantly proved that frank discus-
sion of the most delicate racial matters can
be safely carried on between members of
opposite racial groups. - Each member real-
ised he had gained a more accurate and sym-
pathetic understanding of the problems of
every other delegate. Best of all was the
development of mutual appreciation between
the national groups. A patriotic Korean
said: “For the first time I have discovered
that there exist Japanese of intelligence and
influence who feel with ns regarding the in-
dependence of our country." “I thought I
knew all there was to know about the Japan-
ese and the Chinese,” said a Labor leader
from California, “but here I have been meet-
ing Chinese and Japanese gentlemen of great
culture, ability and personality who are the
superiors of a great many of the Western
delegates. When I get back I shall tell the
boys they've got to study these Far Eastern
people, and they arc going to be intelligent
in their relations with them." A Chinese
delegate wrote after the conference: “I be-
lieve every member went away a warm friend
of every other member, and where friend-
ship is possible everything is possible.” An
American said: “I will never think of the
Japanese or Chinese in terms of race-groups
again, but in terms of T. Z. Koo and of Mr.
Zltmoto.”
The Institute concluded with the record
of only one resolution—a vote of thanks to
the entertainment committee. It held firm
to its original purpose of gaining a common
understanding, leaving to a later date the
formulation of policies.
There will be another meeting next year,
and every year it is hoped more of the people
interested in these problems will get to know
one another and be less disposed to strike in
either ignorance or anger. It is easy to laugh
at the earnest endeavorers who arc in the


.n^venient— eas J' to say that war always has
been, always will be. Not a Digger came
back to Australia in 1919 who was not filled
with the horror and the futility of it ; and
that so vile a thing always has been is no
reason at all why we should fold our arms
and say it always shall be.
LAURA BOGUE LUFFMAN.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Balance-sheet for All Australia.
Amid a copious flow of figures the Jhct
emerges that the Commonwealth has got a
Surplus in paper money as it did in 1916,
1918, 1920, 1921, 1923, 1924 and 1925. It
isn’t wholly responsible for the surpluses,
for the Customs revenue depends on the
quantity of imports, and they depend to a
Considerable extent on the amount which the
States, as well as the Commonwealth, borrow
abroad. Some good things and some silly
and pottering things are foreshadowed on
the strength of this paper prosperity. Out
of a proposed expenditure of £35,000,000 for
"national” roads (as distinct, perhaps, from
denominational roads) spread over 10 years,
the Federal authority is to provide
£20,000,000, the States finding the rest or
borrowing it from the Commonwealth, which
will borrow first. This is characteristically
Federal. The Bruce-Page has a Territory
of its own to develop, and expenditure there
might bring a rich reward in land values,
so it spends its spare money on regions
already developed, where the State Govern-
ments will collect the reward, if any. And
being pledged to the construction of a
Federal railway, which would yield direct
revenue, it is the nature of the creature to
invest fiercely in State roads, which won't.
A trifle of £lOO,OOO is set aside for prospect-
ing, which generally proves to be a renewed
fussing around old, exhausted localities. The
South-to-North railway would open fresh
localities, which might prospect themselves.
The extra defence vote is wholly commend-
able, but the payment in reduction of the
public debt is sketchy and unreal. A ghostly
or foggy atmosphere surrounds the numerous
Federal surpluses and detracts from their
interest. In 1923-24 the balance of revenue
over expenditure was £2,587,194; yet the
Commonwealth spent £6,068,898 of loan
funds on ordinary jobs and £2,412,095
on the old back-number war. On the
published figures the Federal debt in
London grew by over 14 millions. In the
previous year the surplus was much less
and the loan spendings were also less. In
1923-24, when over 14 millions were added to
liabilities in Britain, the accumulated sur-
plus had reached the enormous figure of
£10,015,758. In despair the Bruce-Page
put about half the money into some trust
funds to provide against some future hap-
penings, and used the other half to reduce
the public debt. In addition it paid off (still
in 1923-24) over £3,000,000 of debt out of
sinking fund, and in 1924-25, so fast did
sinking-fund moneys pour in, it paid off
£2,262,530 more debt, and even then was
left with £4,152,992 on hand. This remark-
able accretion of the sinking fund was in
addition to a revenue surplus (1924-25) of
£543,244. Amid all this affluence and gran-
deur the Commonwealth, because it was in a
desperately tight place, borrowed £2O 000,000
In London and New York; —£5,000,000 in
London for its impecunious self and
£15,000,000 in the Yankee city for its pro-
fligate children, the States. Being again
crowded with surplus revenue it proposes to
set aside £4,950,000 for various services as
already mentioned —Defence, instalments of
road grants to States, quest of minerals, etc.
There is no visible discrimination as to wh at
items are charged against loans and what
against revenue, and a road or a post-office
is as comfortable in one account as in the
other. In 1921-22 £2,571,794 of Federal
public works were charged to revenue and
the rest was bon • wed. In 1923-24 only
£620,660 of Federal works expenditure was
paid with revenue money, and the rest was
borrowed. That necessitated more borrow-
ing. of course, and on the other hand the
difference between £2,571,794 and £620,660
helped to create the embarrassing deficit
which has driven the Bruce-Page to forcing
road grants on people who might otherwise
make their own roads. But though the
movability of public works, both Federal and
State, looks aimless, it is purposeful enough.
Enough is charged to foreign loans to justify
the raising of enough new loans to provide
for the interest on old loans and purchases
of goods not otherwise provided for, and
there is no other rule. It would be a won-
derful event if the Federal Government
should decide to put its finances on a clear
and definite basis, and urge the States to do
the same. Information wanted includes these
items-
(l) How much of the past year’s revenue was
sovereigns and how much Government notes with
only a local value? Also, if there is a surplus,
sinking fund or other reserve on hand, what does
ft consist- of?
(2) How much of the expenditure was local, pay-
able with Government notes, and how much was
foreign, and called for sovereigns?
(3) What is the paper revenue or shortage and
the gold ditto?
(4) If there has been a gold shortage (that is
the thing which matters most and about which
information is least or non-existent), how does the
Treasurer propose to meet it, and to prevent a
recurrence of the unhappy event?
If the Federal Government put its accounts
on this basis, and induced the State Treas-
urers by gentle pressure to follow suit, then
the Federal Auditor-General could combine
the seven documents into the public balance-
sheet of all Australia, and the Federal Statis-
tician could print it in his quarterly and annual
volumes, and a fierce light would beat on the
financial throne. As regards some of the
most important matters the present methods
are no light at all, and hardly even a lumi-
nous fog.

Cobham and the Color War.
"Fenc-Suui” : There is another side to the
unhappy shooting of Cobham’s mechanic by
a wandering Arab in Mesopotamia while the
pair were on an experimental flight from
London to Australia. When Britain, urgently
in need of oil, was indulging in a spirited
foreign policy in the region of the Rivers,
Winston Churchill proudly boasted that,
granted a strong air force, there would no
longer be neqd to stand any nonsense from
niggers obstinately concerned about their in-
dependence. A couple of fliers could quickly
wipe out a recalcitrant village for a
tenth of what it would cost an earth-
bound expedition. Hard-shell Imperial-
ists breathed fiery warnings from their
London club armchairs of what was
coming to the negro and Asiatic world
if it was so foolish as to dare the British
raj armed with this new weapon; and here
and there a foretaste was supplied, with emi-
hently satisfactory results. “The situation
is now well in hand,” is the usual official
intimation. It takes no count of the old
men, women and children blown to smither-
eens and the village industries put. out of
action. The notion that the world is strip-
ping to the waist for the first round of the
great scrimmage between white, and colored
for supremacy is widespread in Asia.. A
score of European and some American
writers have published prophecies of the
coming Armageddon, under such provocative
titles as “The Rising Tide of “Color ”( Stod-
dard) , “Mankind at the Crossroads” (East)
and “The Menace of Color” (Gregory).
They are usually issued in tasty wrappers
with pictures of the globe marked in omi-
nous black and white. Industrious Asiatic
journalists extract the fruitiest sections and
translate them into a dozen languages for
the edification of their fellow-countrymen.

An Australian College of Surgeons.
Dear Bulletin, —“Carysfort’s” recent
article on the necessity for the mooted Aus-
tralian College of Surgeons conveys an im-
plication which requires proof. If it be
false, it is cowardly and libellous; if it be
true, the remedy for such an evil does not
lie in the appointment of yet another college
of surgeons. Is it true that the public is to-
day being So exploited by surgical tyros, so
butchered to make a g.p.’s holiday, that a
new body must be created to “become an
essential protection for the sick of the State”?
This body, of course, is “determined to keep
free of political control,” and “the college”
to be effective must be “administered with-
out fear or favor.” Does “Carysfort”
write with his tongue in his cheek, or has
he forgotten Kipling’s
Ere they hewed the Sphinx’s visage
Favoritism governed kissag?,
Even as it does in this age;
or, to come nearer home, the treatment of
Ratten, of Tasmania, by the present guar-
dian body of medical ethics? Fortunately
for the public in that case the efforts of the
guardian body were futile. For a country
surgeon to qualify he will require to be
“recommended and supported by his fellow-
practitioners in the district.” Exercise of
ordinary observation would reveal this pro-
posal as a merry jest. Evidently “CArys-
fort” has not had the opportunity of seeing
how these rival medical Ohristians'love one
another; nor apparently does he know any-
thing about the wires that work .the marion-
ettes. The whole suggestion, as introduced,
appears to be an attempt to rob the indivi-
dual citizen of his faith in private enterprise,
and of his ability to judge character, "and
smacks of the propaganda of Big Business
launched on a post-war public to make them
supersensitive about their ills, suspicious of
everybody who has not a “By Our Permis-
sion” brand on his surgical overalls, and
oblivious of the truth of the adage “By their
fruits ye shall know them.” Moreover, “the
grave responsibility of operating” can be
made graver—at a price—by “wise men,” and
major operations requiring quite ordinary
technical skill and manipulative dexterity
can be (and often are) magnified by “special-
ists” into performances which make the
patient shudder to the depth of his bank
balance. All honest men do not sit on
boards or commissions, and the mooted col-
lege is not the lantern to help the public
Diogenes look for them. “If properly en-
forced,” “Carysfort” adds, “the proposed
qualification will go far to ensure a high
standard to the public.” But, will it ensure
a higher one than that attained by such good
Australians as Earle Page, of Grafton;
Neville Howse, of Orange; and the late
Herrert Maitland, of Sydney, who. were
surgically canonised without the blessing of
any lilywhite college? No! The status of
the profession is still good—so good, in fact,
that it needs more than one Judas in twelve
to justify the appointment of special college
constables to protect the public from surgi-
cal assault and robbery. Local patriotism
is commendable, but it is stretching one’s
credulity overmuch to suggest that, whereas
the standards of the Royal College of Sur-
geons of both England and Scotland (he
omits the. ugly duckling in Dublin) are
“purely academic,” and those of America’s
college allegedly evasible and venable, Aus-
tralia is to found a college whose, standards
and conduct will be above suspicion. This
hankering after critical, judicial, yet irre-
sponsible, new boards and commissions is a
pathological tendency which may well be
left to the political, and banned from the
medical, profession, which even in our ultra-
democracy is still “the noblest.” —Yours,
S. N. R.

Cotton Viewed n= a Raw Material.
In the frequent luck;. .vay of this country’s
natural resources, it is reported that the Com-
monwealth must come to the rescue of the
cotton industry now that the State aid has
left off. The Tariff Board recommended a
bounty of 2d. per lb. on all seed cotton, and
10 years was proposed as the term, with a
prospect, of course, of further terms to
follow. Further terms followed almost auto-
matically in the case of sugar, and the last
one seems permanent. The Government
which has to find the money suggests that
the allowance should be per lb. of seed
cotton and the term five years. This is
declared to be grossly inadequate; yet it
would mean roughly 4Jd. per lb. on the
marketable article, and when 5001 b. of lint
go to the bale it would mean £9 7s. 6d. per
bale. If the crop grew as large as that of
Peru, which hardly counts, the year’s bonus
would be about £470,0C0. On a crop the
size of India’s, the bill would be in the
vicinity of £27,000,000. On the United
States crop, a bonus of 14d. per lb. in
the raw might easily cost £140,000,000. The
real question to be answered seems to be
this: Suppose cotton-lint to be worth lOd,
per lb. in the English market, and suppose
Australia can’t put its cotton on the far-
away English market for less than 14d. or
is the growing of cotton for export
a natural resource or not 7 The business
seems good enough if Australia grows cotton
for use in its own factories to make its
own clothes, provided the cost of the locally
used article isn’t run up to an absurdly high
figure, as in the case of sugar. If there was
a big rise the price of clothes would be
much too high, and in the chase after a
share of the artificial prosperity a big sur
plus might be produced, as happened with
sugar, which could only be sold abroad at
a loss big enough to hit the artificial pros-
perity in the solar plexus. If the artificial
boom ran up the cost of production extra-
much—and it certainly did where sugar was
concerned—then the gap between the cost
of producing the surplus and the price at
which it could be sold might become a hole
large enough to swallow the entire industry.
An inference which may be drawn from the
figures is that cotton-growing, as a purely
primary and self-supporting industry, is a
primary dud, barring some unbelievable
reduction in cost of production. On the
other hand, regarded as a modest adjunct
to the secondary local industry of making
clothes, it should have a future, provided the
importer of cotton wares can be reduced to
a proper state of insignificance. The fac-
tories might possibly live without the cotton
fields, bringing their raw material from
abroad as Britain does; but it appears
that the only way cotton-growing can live
without the factories is by living on the
taxpayer to an impossible extent.

Transporting the Pommy.
Three years ago it was agreed by the states-
men of the Empire in conference that
something positively would have to be done
about migration. Although nobody was un-
kind enough to say it, almost everybody
present realised that Britain was uncomfort-
ably afflicted with people. So there was
talk about (1) the Dominion’s need for
populations big enough to stand effectively
in the gate when their right to live on their
holdings was challenged by the lesser
breeds, and (2) the necessity for producing
more foodstuffs to feed the Old Man’s
increasing family. Representatives of Bald-
win's first Government were more interested
than it would have been diplomatic to let
on, but they broke down at last and con-
fessed that the Old Man would be prepared to
part with a great many millions of money
—34 of them were mentioned at one stage—-
in order to promote in the minds of the
British an affection for Colonial life. An
Overseas Settlement Committee was there-
fore set up, with power to subsidise the
export of migrants, and various overseas
politicians, with the London influence cling-
ing round them like a fog, returned to pro-
pound schemes for unemployed townsfolk
turning into farmers. The result hasn’t
been impressive. With the possible exception
of Maoriland, not one of the Dominions has
even maintained its pre-war migration rate.
During the 12 months ended last March the
committee spent less than half a million and
the assisted migrants numbered only 44,214,
distributed as follows :
Australia .. 25,596 I Maoriland . . 8225
Canada .. 10,266 [ South Africa .. 127
The Old Man provided approximately half the
cost, and the overseas units of Empire chipped
in, Canada contributing about £6 a head,
Australia £ll and Maoriland £l2 for their
respective quotas. Lord Apsley, who was
here a few months ago and actually went to
work on the land for a few days to see what
it felt like, said he had been struck with the
success of Canada in attracting British
migrants through reduced fares, and with
the comparative failure of Australia to
lure because fares were not reduced.
He was quite wrong; but his error
is symptomatic. Canada offers rather
more inducement to the Pommy agri-
culturist willing to go on the land and
rough it in pioneer style than any other
part of the Empire; and the old-fashioned
Bmish notion that migrants are all of
that type still pervades the minds of both
Englishmen and “Colonials.” Since Canada
offers that sort of migrant the best chance,
the assumption is that she must be getting
the most migrants. But she isn’t, as the
latest official figures, above cited, show.
Maoriland, which is administered by farmers
for farmers, lavs itself out to import farm
labor; but, despite all precautions, almost
all the imported labor drifts eventually into
the towns. Australia, according to some of
Bruce’s critics, is paying on an average
£3OOO a head to convert English townies
into farmers; but there are so many of them
in the cities that it is obvious the process,
however expensive, isn’t entirely effective.
The plain truth seems to be that so long as
the people who profess to “think Imperially”
continue also to think archaically, and to
disregard the changes that a century or so
has brought about, they won’t make much
of a success of redistributing the Empire’s
whites. The only way to do that efficiently
is to cater overseas for an army of migrants
that doesn’t want to go farming, and
hasn’t the slightest intention of going
farming. Mother’s political advisers fear
that, if that army is allowed to do anything
else but till the ground, her factories will
lack orders; yet her technical advisers (as
represented by the Balfour committee, for
instance) point out philosophically that
Mother’s best customers are highly industri-
alised countries.

Alimony and H.C.L.
A new point in alimo. y law has cropped up,
and the Higher Courts may have to decide
it. In connection with a divorce which dates
back to 1908 permanent alimony was granted
to the wife at £2 10s. per week. Some years
ago the husband voluntarily increased the
allowance by a pound a week on account of
the increased cost of living. The wife, still
dissatisfied, recently raised the issue that, as
her husband’s income—£soo per annum at
the time of the old award —was now at least
four times that amount, she was entitled to
a legal increase. It was contended that the
Judge had no power to increase alimony once
a marriage had been dissolved, the case of
Baxter tv Baxter (1911), when such an
increase was refused, being quoted ; but Jus-
tice Owen, after deep pondering, ruled that
power does exist to vary any order, and is
considering whether he will exercise it. Many
put-asunder persons, male and female, are
now holding their breaths awaiting s’Honah’s
decision—of course, for very different rea-
sons. If Justice Owen’s opinion is upheld
the rush of women to secure an increase of
what lias in many cases become a starvation
allowance will interfere with the other traffic
in King-street. If, on the other hand, the
opinion is quashed, the law ought to be
amended. An allowance of £5 which, owing
entirely to the smaller purchasing power of
the sovereign, is now worth only £3 is mani-
festly unjust.

Juvenile Migration.
“L.S.M.” : The Big Brother movement in Vic-
toria and N. S. Wales has an admirable
ideal, and its founder, Richard Linton, may
well feel proud of his efforts to date. But
“M.G.S.” (B. 24/6/’26) is quite wrong when
he says that “other States will come into
line presently.” That is, if he means “all
States.” Queensland, for example, when Mr.
Linton was being “terrified at the spec-
tacle of Britain’s unemployed” in 1923, had
been successfully operating a “British Boys’
Scheme” for a year. The scheme, inaugu-
rated and conducted by the New Settlers’
League in co-operation with the State Gov-
ernment, has been running since July, 1922.
To date well over 2000 lads have been intro-
duced, and they are arriving at the rate of
100 monthly. The lads have proved quite
satisfactory, and though Queensland does not
claim such a high percentage of “successes”
as the Big Brothers, records show that 96 p.c.
may be so classed. The comparison is of
little value, though, as when the Queensland
scheme had been operating for a year only
1 per cent, had proved unsatisfactory. The
Queensland-British lads are efficiently “wel-
fared” by trained and sympathetic officers.
They are placed under definite apprentice-
ship agreements with suitable farmers for
three years—-one year at a time, so that
they may change their employers at the end
of their first and second years if they wish.
The apprenticeship ensures continuity of
employment. Lads may not be employed in
seasonal industries —fruit-picking, cotton-
picking, etc. —and then left stranded. The
agreement may only be terminated by the
Premier of Queensland or his appointed
agent. The boys are carefully guarded
against sweating, poor accommodation and so
on. The league employs a full-time experi-
enced welfare inspector, who lias free rail-
way facilities for himself and his motor-
cycle. All branches of the league and clerks
of petty sessions are available to assist the
boys in their districts by advice and friend-
ship. The H.Q. office of the league keeps in
constant touch with the lads. Mr. Linton's
Little Brother is encouraged to save. The
boy under the Queensland scheme has no
option. He is employed at a minimum
wage of 15s. (with keep), rising at regular
fixed intervals throughout his apprenticeship
term. Under the provisions of the scheme,
two-thirds of his earnings are forwarded
monthly by the employer direct to the
Immigration Agent, Brisbane, who keeps a
separate savings-bank account for each lad.
The whole aim is to give the lads thorough
training in the trade of farming and ensure
that when they have it they 'will also have
some little capital to make a start with.
Queensland wishes Mr. Linton w T ell; but it
is quite unlikely to discard the proved sub-
stance for the unproved shadow.

The Right to Be a “ Struggle!*. ”
Dear Bulletin, —Settling our young men
on the land in N. S. Wales is wdiat the
Yanks call a sure fine appeal for votes at
election-time; but. the whereabouts of the
necessary land to settle upon within this
State is a mystery. The London Times, in-
spired by the Lord knows who, informs its
readers that young men emigrating to these
parts are entitled to farms up to 10,000
acres, upon which the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment wall lend three times the amount of the
settlers’ assets. Against this prodigality of
land and cash dangled before the eyes of
the migrant, we have the official statement
in the last annual report of the N. S. Wales
Lands Department that “the area of Crown
lands available and suitable for settlement
is fast becoming insignificant.” That this
is true is borne out by the fact that a block
of 1600 acres in the Narrandera district
which was lately made available by the
Government attracted 4000 applicants. Some
of the applicants will be men who have been
trying for years to win the chance of making
a living on the land they were born on, and
who will have sufficient cash and experi-
ence to make a success of the proposition.
Some will be young men who have a life’s
experience of farming and grazing, but in-
sufficient capital; they may, with good sea-
sons to start with, pay their way and ulti-
mately make a competency. Others who are
“taking a fly at it” will be insufficiently
equipped in brains, cash and experience, and
are foredoomed to failure under almost any
conditions of settlement. The vote-snaring
politician who professes to believe that a
city man has only to be settled on a small,
dry block to make it blossom with the fruits
of the earth argues that everyone should
be entitled to take up a farm at the tax-
payers’ expense, even though he has .no hope
of meeting his liabilities in this skilled busi-
ness that he has neither the cash nor the
experience to succeed in. Under this policy
the State runs the risk of getting the bad
marks, whilst the men who have the cash
and experience are pushed into the arms of
Bat and Co., who are in the subdivision
business. It suits the right men better to pay
syndicates a lot more for the same class of
land and get to work at once than waste
years chasing ballots all over the State in
the hope of getting cheap State land on easy
terms. Then, again, the private syndicates
subdivide with due regard to the area re-
quired to make a living, whereas the Govern-
ment land is usually offered in areas so
small for the purpose of grazing that prac-
tical men view them with contempt. When

any block over a thousand or two acres is
offered by the Crown, the description gen-
erally reads: “Rough mountainous country
of poor quality; rabbits and dingoes fairly
thick; grazing only; thickly timbered with
gum, messmate, peppermint, hop-bush and
wattle scrub; no permanent water, but
dam sites exist” —a description that reflects
more credit upon the department’s honesty
than its good sense in advertising such rub-
bish. But, judging by the fact that only an
occasional block of good land is put to a
ballot, the department is hard pressed to
find even these morsels to throw to the ever-
increasing crowd of the native-born clamor-
ing for land. That being so, where is the
sense in inviting inexperienced men with
little or no capital to compete with our own
young farmers and graziers for the very
limited area of Crown lands available? To
put men from the. cities on the land and
keep them there by spoon-feedine at the tax-
payers’ expense is as futile as putting new
tweed on the seat of old pants. If we had
an unlimited supply of State land there
might be some excuse for the cheap political
sentiment expressed by “Give every poor
devil a chance on the land”; but, with a
supply quite inadequate for the demand, it is
sheer idiocy to hold out special inducements
to the incapables. Therefore the State
should encourage settlement only by those
men who are equipped for success. Even
the most ignorant politician would scarcely
assert that it is good for the State to put
men on the land 'who have no hope of making
a living and paying their debts to the State,
which, after all, is just “you and me.” —

The downhill sprint of the once-flourishing
Australian meat industry, to which The
Bulletin has repeatedly begged for atten-
tion, has just received another striking
advertisement. Brunette Downs, one of the
finest cattle properties in the Northern
Territory, has been put up at auction in
Sydney without eliciting a bid. The big
run, which is carrying over 40,000 head of
carefully-bred shorthorns, is one of the best
appointed in Australia, homesteadings and
equipment being valued at over £30,000.
while incidentals include, beside stores, over
1000 head of horses. There was no fixed
starting price to scare buyers. Yet not one
of the few. present thought it worth while
to open his mouth, for everyone with a
knowledge of the business is convinced that
the sun of the Australian cattleman has
set, so far as the export trade is concerned,
and whether it will ever rise again is doubt-
ful. The world outside Australia is practi-
cally closed to Australian meat, cost of
production being higher than in any com-
peting country. The only hope that seems
worth harboring is a good local market, and
that calls for a vastly increased population.
"Bi ttenderry” : The presidential address at
the annual show of the N.S.W. Sheep-
brecders’ Association contained some sig-
nificant passages. Mr. Body stated
that: “there had been a falling off in
the production of fine merino wool in every
country in the world except Africa,” and
explained that breeders would make more
money out of sixties wool than out of the
fine and super-fiue seventies, eighties and
nineties. The position appears to be that
South Africa, whom we started in the
fine-wool business by selling her the pick
of our flocks, is concentrating on . the
production of fine wool, while our own
breeders are content to produce a coarser
variety because there is more money in it
—for the time being. It is a short-sighted
policy. The buyers are demanding line wool,
and, if South Africa can supply it and
we cannot, it will not be long before we
lose the pre-eminent position in the wool
trade that we have held for nearly a cen-
tury. The president further remarked that
if the buyers, who w r ere constantly criticising
the quality of our wool, were prepared to
pay the price for fine and superfine, they
could get it. That is true enough, inasmuch
ns we certainly can produce fine wool ; but
the noint is that, at present, we are not
producing it in any great quantity, in spite
of the insistent and increasing demand for
it. It will take several years to get the
bulk of our wool back to the fine and super-
fine. varieties, and as our breeders give no
indication of making an immediate move in
that direction, South Africa, a potentially
dangerous competitor bv reason of lower
freights and cheaper labor, is likely to be-
come the Mecca of fine-wool buyers.

If Vic. Laborites are good sports, they will
say no more about Baron Somers’s work as
a volunteer at the London Times office
during the general strike, which wasn’t a strike
as English people know the thing. Without
referring specifically to a nasty interjection
by Solly at the Parliamentary dinner to
him, Somers said he had never been a
rabid party politician and it was easy for
him to throw aside all bias. He wanted the
confidence of all parties, and would work
with any or all of them for the good of the
State. Solly’s sneer, voiced while Premier
Allan was proposing the Governor’s health.
was that Somers had distinguished himself
during the great strike as well as during the
Great War. But if Solly objected to the
guest, why did he come as host?

An Amencan missionary in Korea the other
day forgot his Christian principles, and
branded the character for “thief” on the fore-
head of a boy who had stolen apples. The
consequences may be serious. The Japanese
authorities dislike the Christian soul-savers
because of their support of Korean national-
ism. Already the reactionary elements in
Japan are organising mass meetings, and
the jingo papers are weeping over the in-
jury to their “Hello w-Ivorean.” Some time
ago the Mikado tried to oust the missionaries
by official action. Now lie may be able to
get assistance, from the Korean mobs, and the
prospects of a shindy are by no means dull.

’•Steelsby” : The North German Lloyd Co. will
next month commence a direct three-monthly
service between Hamburg and Australia. The
innovation ought to be welcomed by all
broad-minded Australians, even if the Kaiser
hasn’t been hanged. If this country must
have foreigners, by all means let aliens whose
characteristics most closely resemble our
own assist to fill our open spaces. The Ger-
man is that alien, and only the one-eyed will
deny it. Many German-Australians fought
with the A.1.F., and only dog-in-the-manger
union bosses, ignorant politicians and bigots
would maintain a vendetta in this country
against the cross-bred Digger’s forebears.
Monarchical Germany is no more, and it is
not likely to be. resuscitated. Who would
be the first to spring to Australia’s aid at
a pinch in the future—your naturalised
Italian or Greek, or Jerry? .Terry every
time! The German whom the N. D. L. Co.
aims to bring here will not be your London
and New York waiter, who delights in ferry-
ing across to the Fatherland at intervals.
Our Fritz will be what he was in the past,
the settler who settles in downright earnest,
which is more than can be said of the South-
ern Europeans who are swarming in.
For many years prices for rabbit-skins have
been going up, partly because other fur ani-
mals are diminishing, and partly because
new uses are being found for rabbit fur. The
average price paid for skins this winter
would work out at about 9d. per skin; some
years ago it would have taken a pound of
skins to make 9d. That even the present
high prices will be eclipsed in the future
seems certain; and it is estimated that this
year despised bunny will be worth about
£2,500,000 to Australia. The successful rab-
biter should be making pounds a day; yet
he pays nothing to the landholder who raises
the rabbits. The latter, for his part, destroys
millions of them during the summer when
skins are of little value, and also wages
ruthless war on the kittens at all times. It
is a curious situation in a way, and it is
doubtful whether the destruction will be as
general and enthusiastic in the future. In
fact, considering the upward tendency of
rabbit-fur prices and the downward tendency
of wool prices, and considering also that only
one sheep can be pastured where 30 rabbits
will thrive, it will be remarkable if certain
classes of timbered grazing country are not
given over to rabbit-raising before long. It
would be hard luck for the rabbiter who
now gets his rabbits raised for nothing; but.
a proletarian (if a man who makes three or
four pounds a day is a proletarian) must
expect to have his face ground now and again
by capitalists.

“Gkegor” : With Canberra entering on its job
as the Federal capital, there is an excellent
opportunity to found an Australian univer-
sity whose function would be purely research
work in matters of vital interest to the
Commonwealth. At present there exists not
a single institution or body devoted to the
investigation of the science and technology
of wool-production and sheep-raising,
although it is our foremost industry. Agri-
culture, stock-raising and forestry are little
better off. At Canberra the work performed
by Farrer could be carried on. The univer-
sities in the capital cities can hardly be ex-
pected to devote themselves to matters of
natural importance; they are technical
schools rather than academic centres com-
parable to those of other parts of the world,
and are mostly without either the facilities
or the means for research. In Canberra
there w r ould be found the seclusion and the
atmosphere eminently suited for scientific
investigation. The cost of establishing such
a university would be returned a hundred-
fold in the value of the scientific work that
might be confidently expected from it.

The coastal steamship services of the Com-
monwealth ought to be developing in step
with the growth of population, but instead
they are fading out of the picture, so far
as passenger lines are concerned, at any
rate. The latest move is the sale of the
6000-ton passenger ships Wyreema and
Levuka, which used to trade with Queensland
ports. Both good, sound vessels, with many
years of usefulness before them, they have
been sold to South American buyers, and
Australia will know them no more. And
they are not being replaced. Up to 10 years
ago the companies used to sell their old ships
with a view to replacement by bigger and
faster craft, but now they just sell their
ships. The fact is that inter-State passenger-
carrying on the Australian coast is no longer
a profitable business. The Adelaide line, for
instance, went out of it five years ago and
the companies that stayed in, as in the pre-
sent instance, are shortening sail to cut their
losses. The reasons are fairly obvious. In
addition to tne competition of railways, whose
losses are paid for by the taxpayer, the
shipowners are subject to legislative condi-
tions which place them and the public which
employs them entirely at the mercy of the
men who work the ships. So inviting is the
field thus presented to the professional strike-
fomenter, the Bolshevik and the I.W.YV.-ite,
that it has had a good deal more than its
fair share of attention, with the result that
shipping, including coastal shipping, has been
subjected for years to every sort of handicap
and dislocation that the ingenuity of a -uos-
cow-inflamed mind could compass. Coastal
shipping, so far as the workers employed in
it are concerned, is a well-protected industry.
But it is not well enough protected to
resist an all-the-year-round campaign to
destroy it, conducted by those engaged in it.

The big cable companies of the world still
refuse to regard themselves as foolish ana-
chronisms. The largest concern engaged in
the business is the Telegraph Construction
Co., which makes and lays cables but does not
work them. Its new cable-laying ship, the
Dominia, 9060 tons, has just loaded the 3500
miles of copper and rubber rope which the
Pacific Cable Board —the Commonwealth is
a partner—has ordered for the duplication
of its Vancouver-Fanning Island section.
This section, being the longest and nearly the
slowest in the world, is badly in need of
bucking up, and the new link, which weighs
8500 tons, is composed of a new alloy which
gives enormously increased speed. There is
one factor in the new material that is giving
cable engineers something to think about.
The localisation of faults or breaks is always
a tricky business, and the new metal intro
duces fresh complications. The new cabh'
will come to rest in some places over three
miles below the surface. If a fault occurs
here localisation from the shore, perhaps a
thousand miles away, and picking up, will
be a ticklish job.

The latest proposal for an Anzac mem-
orial in Melbourne involves the resump-
tion of two ancient pubs, the Old White Hart
and the Imperial, which decorate the cor-
ners of Bourkc-street opposite Federal Par
liament House. With these out of the way
room will have been made for a city square
of some dignity, in which it is imoposed to
erect a cenotaph, the total cost to be about
£150,000, instead of the £250,000 that the
original scheme for a Shrine of Remembrance
in-St. Kilda-rpad would have required from
a public that has displayed a curious reluctance
to disgorge; The only dubious feature of the
new proposal is Premier Allan’s offer to
allocate £50,000 of the public funds if the
design of the cenotaph is submitted to popu-
lar vote. The symmetrical farmer is appa -
rently convinced that a public so discrimi-
nating as to select him for office could be in
no danger of making a mistake when asked
to choose between a pyramid, a rhombohe-
dron and a cube.

"Shanghai” : The kidnapping of white people
in China has lately become one of the great
natural industries. The method adopted is to
seize Europeans under the unseeing noses of
the local authorities, transport them to the
mountains and hold them for ransom. The
ambassador! of the foreign Power concerned
thereupon makes angry representations to
the impotent Central Government, which
makes a show of moving troops in pursuit
of the kidnappers; but before long the
amount required»is usually handed over. The
price varies according to the difficulty of keep-
ing the captive in custody. If the chase grows
hot, his owner may sell him to another firm,
which is compelled to raise the price de-
manded for his release in order to realise a
profit on the transaction. These operations
are generally represented by foreigners to
be part of an anti-white crusade; hut that
is probably wrong. At any rate, if whites
are unavailable, a fellow-countryman will do.
A wealthy Chinese merchant was lately
stolen from the very centre of the Shanghai
foreign settlem'ent and kept hidden for
several weeks, being sold and re-sold to
different kidnapping syndicates before a satis-
factory deal was made that allowed of his
release.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Commonwealth Treasurer Page said in his
Budget speech that his proposals for re-
adjusting the Federal and State financial
arrangements were based on the principle
that “the authority which expends money
•shall have the responsibility for raising it.”
There is nothing wrong with that; but the
House was straightway asked to wrestle with
a new schedule of Customs duties on petrol and
substitutes, rubber tyres and tubes and motor
chassis, the produce of which —estimated
at £1,500,000 p.c.—is, for 10 years or there-
abouts, to be handed over to the States for
expenditure on roads. So did the devil of
inconsistency fly away with the doctor’s
principle. There is a case for higher duties
designed to increase the production of tyres
and petrol substitutes and encourage the.
complete manufacture of motor vehicles, but
it is folly to mix it up with what are purely
provincial matters. Let the States levy their
own taxes for the construction and mainten-
ance of their roads. The Commonwealth, by
butting into the business, is asking for
trouble.
The limp, lame and languid make-believe
of pioneering is evidenced again in the Bruce-
Page loan estimates. The Commonwealth
has 1012 miles of line yet to build across
Australia, and the 676 miles already con-
structed require to be widened to the stand-
ard gauge. Further, Canberra, if it is to
amount to anything, wants to be connected
with its port and a main railway line. With
all this work of its own to do the loan for
Federal railways of every sort is £1,474,500.
And the amount provided as a Federal contri-
bution towards the few miles of lines in N. S.
Wales and Queensland which will complete
a duplicate route between Sydney and Bris-
bane is £1,000,000.
Political propaganda against the Federal
Government’s proposal to cut out the per
capita payments to the States takes dubious
forms. The Yic. commission which has
been doing splendid work in reducing diph-
theria in country districts lias been told by
the Allan Ministry to postpone* its opera-
tions because the Government won’t know
how much money is coming to it until the
per capita argument is settled.
Bruce has a high opinion of John Gunn,
and it is no secret in Adelaide that he has
been pressing the S. Aust Labor Premier
to take a job on the Migration Commission.
Gunn was at first unwilling, but the offer
has been repeated, and there urns an impres-
sion in North-terrace early in the week that,
saying he would ne’er consent, he had con-
sented.
The wind is being tempered for the shorn
lambs of the Federal public service who are
being passed on from Melbonrne to Canberra.
Some of them have been wondering what is
to become of their homes, now that they have
to seek others in a place where the price
t>f everything has to be reached by ladder
Ur aeroplane: wo, reckoning that the Gov-
ernment ought to carry part of the burden,
Bruce has promised ro buy every house
vacated at a price to be fixed by a committee
of valuators, if the owner is satisfied with
the valuation. The money will be paid to
the individual's building account in the bush
capital, and will go towards defraying the
cost of his new nest. It is a reasonable
thing to do for men who are being used as
pawns in a silly game.
Jock Garden, Moscow's white-haired boy
in Australia, has been appointed a member
of the A.L.P. publicity committee to carry
on the latter's campaign against the refer-
enda. The appointment lias an intriguing
aspect, as showing how genuine was Labor’s
repudiation of Garden and all his commu-
nistic works prior to the Federal election.
It should also buck Bruce and Charlton enor-
mously, for Garden is in a class by himself
as a champion of “bung” causes. Ilis pro-
minence in the “No” ranks is a cheering
presage of a majority for “Yes.”
If Lang and Badly had wanted to create
a scare and frighten employers into sacking
men wholesale, they couldn't have improved
much on their Workers’ .Compensation Act.
One section which has caused terror says
that “where the injury is a disease which is
of such a nature as to be contracted by a
gradual process, compensation shall be paid
by the employer who last employed the
worker.” It makes the employer’s prospect
appalling until you find that “injury” has
a limited meaning, and though it includes
disease, “disease” means only “a disease
which is contracted by the worker in the
course of his employment, and to which the
employment was a contributing factor.” Most
of the clauses are clumsy at some point or
other —thanks to the copious use of the gag
in the Assembly and the shameful failure of
the Council to do its job properly.
Much of the trouble that has been caused
by Lang’s supreme piece of folly, the Com-
pensation Act, is due to his nose of the
strong man who could round up these capital-
istic ruffians. The measure is therefore full
PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE.
“The purification of Melbourne’s dubious milk supply is again indefinitely postponed. Far more atten-
tion is given to the quality of the city’s whisky than of its milk.”

of bark; and the bark is doing much of the
damage. For instance, insurance cos. that
take out licenses are commanded “to enter
into a contract of reinsurance with any other
licensed insurer,” and they may be each re-
quired to accept a re-insurance risk for as
much as the original insurer takes. But the
Act doesn’t say what price the co. that is
required to take re-insurance shall ask for
the job; as a matter of fact, the associated
rates are minimum rates, and if an asso-
ciated office is offered re-insurance which it
thinks more than ordinarily risky, it may
ask exactly what premium it pleases pro-
vided it isn’t less than the association rate.
When introducing his precious Workers’
Compensation Bill, Baddeley ridiculed the
notion that “the public will have to bear
very heavy charges owing to the increased
cost of production.” The fatheaded gentle-
man was sure that “the increased eost of
production will be almost infinitesimal.” A
comparison of Government office rates per
cent, with those charged by the insur-
ance cos. under the old Act show that
wheat-stackers have gone up from 30s. to
110 s., tree-fellers from iOos. to 2805., mill
employees from 725. to 200 a. anti tiinbef-get-
ters from 90s. to 2005., all p.a, These ate
only two out of a multitude of sandbagged
industries, and coal and bread are already
dearer, with innumerable commodities to
follow. Incidentally, Opposition-leader Bavin
voted for the second reading, and offered to
assist in knockiug Baddeley’s crude proposals
into a measure that would work without
destroying; but the Government hadn’t
gumption enough to take him at his word
and involve him in any subsequent compli-
cations. It gagged GO clauses through com
mittee without a moment’s; discussion.
A new phase of the N.S.W. compensation
calamity was disclosed when the theatrical
employees sought refuge in the recent High
Court decision as to the paramountcy of
Federal laws over those of a State. They
have gone to the Federal Arbitration Court
with a log of conditions and compensations
for illnesses and accidents. If the Federal
courts should regard the monument to Bad-
deley’s genius in the same light as they saw
the N.S.W. 44 Hours Act, the tangle will
take some unravelling.
There are a good many cases in which the
Federal Arbitration Court has already
directed the N. S. Wales employer what lie
shall do in regard to his employees’ acci-
dents and sickness. The journalists, for in-
stance, have such a Federal award. So the
newspaper proprietor has two masters shout-
ing different instructions into his ear at the
same moment, and each mentioning some-
tiling with boiling oil in it if he disobeys.
And, in spite of that, there are still some
papers stupid enough to oppose the handing
over of the whole business to the - Common-
wealth.
The Westralian Government reports that
its hopes are blighted, and its cake is dough,
and its name is Mud. The ledger won’t bal-
ance, and the State is in for its 15tli con-
secutive deficit. Ministers blame the strike
of British seamen in Australia for a great
part of the trouble, and they ought to know,
as they pampered the strikers, refused to
p otect peaceful people from their violence,
and practically ordered the police to remain
quiescent and let the imported mob loot
the ships at Fremantle. But they weren’t
trying to balance the State’s ledger at the
time; they were only trying to balance them-
selves on the precarious perch of office.
Among things mooted is that the N.S.W.
Government may make Workmen’s Compen-
sation insurance a State monopoly. It won’t,
if the Bruce-Page Ministry gets busy with
a comprehensive Act of its own. By one of
the neglected powers of the Constitution, in-
surance, except State insurance confined to
one State, is a matter for Federal control.
No mere state authority, if the Common-
wealth attended to its business, WOttld have
the. right to license companies to do Compen-
sation or any other kind of insurance, to
withhold licenses, to collect deposits from
companies, or make any of the rules and
regulations which have been poured forth
so plentifully.
Workmen's Compensation is a man-trap
and spring-gun for Labor Governments. In
Westralia a benevolent but unfinancial and
helter-skelter Cabinet sought to enlarge the
provision against miners’ consumption by
extending the possibilities of insurance to
people who have already got the almost
incurable complaint, and in the kindness of
its heart fixed the rate as low as £4 10s. per
cent. The companies refused to insure, esti-
mating the certain loss at half a million.
Whereupon the helter-skelter Cabinet an-
nounced that it would start its own Insur-
ance Department with no legal authority,
and withdraw from the companies their,
licenses to either issue new policies or renew
old ones. The business of issuing licenses
to insurance cos. for any class of business
and of supervising them in every way is a
Federal matter under the Constitution, and
if the sluggish Ministry would only take
the trouble to pass and administer the neces-
sary Act it might end a lot of troubles in
various States, and prevent the formation
of a lot of cronk institutions.
Maoriland is on the right track. A recent
Order-in-Council prohibits the export of ’pos-
sum skins except in the form of fur coats
and other manufactured articles.
Sitting in silence but voting as one graven
image, the Labor majority in Sydney City
Council rejected the advice of its chief
mechanical engineer to purchase British
motor-cars (the Council has - the motor-car
habit badly) at £312 10s. each, and decided
on Italian vehicles at £125 and Yankee ones
at £595. One alderman recently blurted out
that he "had a right to look after the in-
terests of his friend who was in the trade,”
and apparently that was being done. It is
to be hoped that any friend who is looked
after by an alderman looks after the aider-
man a little in return. He is a thankless
dog if he doesn’t.
Priminister Coates of Maoriland hangs on
to Railways, and has certainly shaken up the
dry bones since he took charge three years
ago. His style was at first cramped by
"Iron Duke” McVillv, the autocratic general
manager. Now MeVilly has retired and there
aren’t going to be any more general managers.
The Railways Board, consisting of officers
selected by tin l Minister, has. been running
things for nearly a year, and now Coates is
talking of advertising all positions in the
highest grades and instituting a system of
merit and demerit marks. With the old rules
of promotion abolished and the machine
responsive to his control through his own
appointees, Coates wall be able to indulge
his penchant for boosting “bright young
men.” And of course his opponents will talk
of Tammany and "political pulls,” just as
the crowd (Mates leads used to talk in the
days of Seddon and Ward.
The craving of some people to put other
people on the land and leave them there
leads to much mad correspondence. A very
wild person lately set the ball rolling briskly
in the S. M. Herald with a proposal that
“settlers’- should be placed on 10-acre blocks
of barren or worn-out land in the County of
Cumberland. It was to be enriched with
“garbage,” a substance which is found in
tins, consists largely of bottles and old hats,
and is costly to remove. Then happiness was
to supervene. Ten-acre farms, if occupied
each by_a man, wife and two infants, would
mean 256 persons to the rural square mile,
added to any who are there already. France
and Denmark, including their towns and
cities, aren’t packed like that. Yet the
scheme was really not much worse than
Joey Carruthers’s Million Farms.
The U.S.A. has regretfully decided that
the war bonds of the Imperial Russian Gov-
ernment are “stumer,” as Israel would say,
and has written them off as bad debts. Curi-
ously Britain has had more losses through
repudiation in America than in any other
country except Russia. Apart from money
lent by England to the Southern Confederacy
during the Civil War, various American
States owe Britain some 60 million pounds
for cash borrowed, and have refused to pay
it. The Federal Government has blandly
informed all and sundry that it isn’t respon-
sible for State liabilities, and has no power
to make the welshers part up. Jonathan’s
losses on the Russian account are unlikely
therefore to wring tears of sympathy from
Cousin Bull.
The Vic.-Tasmanian branch of the Meat
Industry Employees’ Union has adopted the
principle that, if all men are not born equal, it
is the duty of the best to make themselves
no better than the worst. When, therefore,
a member in any one week has earned the
award rate, his activities, either inside or
outside his job, must cease.

It's evident we’ve been.
We’ve learned the scheme he lives upon
And practise what we’ve seen.
And round and round and round we go;
We dodge the rain and suu

Ourselves what we have done.
Here’s a whole continent to spare,

The profit speaks loudly of prudent manage-
ment. Most of the lines handled are turned
over on narrow margins, for the disappear-
ance of one clutch of small competitors does
not seem to discourage others. Large-scale
buying, a keen watch on expenditure, trading
based on long experience—this is the co.’s
60th year—and a very conservative financial
policy have brought Harper’s to its present
position. The additions to reserves on this
occasion were, as usual, substantial; reserves
look healthy in relation to paid capital of
£415,000, even though goodwill is in at
£BO,OOO. The market’s opinion is that some-
thing must happen soon, and sellers have
been asking 325. 6d. for the ordinaries. Chair-
man Robert Gibson’s remarks to, sharehold-
ers at the annual meeting certainly do not
encourage any idea of an orgy of dividend-
paying :
We have again recommended the same divs. The
avowed policy of your directorate is to build up the
resources of the co. so that if an opportunity of
expansion offers, whether in the development of the
business in any direction or in the inevitable expendi-
ture in fixed assets which must be looked for in
the future, the co. will have available in its own
resources the capital necessary for any such operation.
This policy is so sound as scarcely to require emphasis.
But that, of course, does not destroy the
market’s obvious hopes of something in the
way of a transfer of reserves to capital. On
the other hand, the investor has to remember
that the high market price is not in this case
a sure guide to the probabilities, because
comparatively few ordinary, shares are on
the market —family interests held the lot
tight until three or four years ago. When
a few were released there was a tussle to
get into a good thing; and this keen demand
coupled with the limited offerings has had
the result of driving prices to their present
level. In ordinary circumstances it would
appear inevitable that a heavy bonus-distri-
bution was immediately in view; but though
a distribution is possible, it is not as inevit-
able as the market price might suggest.
Meantime, the position is one to give great
comfort to holder’s :

Assets are all they seem—-and more. The
freeholds item represents the co.’s factory and
other premises in four States; their present-
day value is well in excess of the amount at
which they appear. In 1914 plant and fix-
tures were giver, a book value of £96,808;
despite considerable expansion since then,
the items on March 31 appear at £65,293.
Stocks are in at cost or under. Rook debts
are higher, but the management records
favorable experience in the , matter of bad
debts, which may be accepted as evidence of
the quality of that entry. Of the more liquid
assets £74,637 is in Commonwealth stock
(face value, £75,320), most of it 6 p.c., and
all free of State income-tax. Most of the
cash is earning interest. Shareholders may
feel even more comfortable when they con-
sider the improvement since 1916 as shown
in this summary :

During the period new capital amounted to

£215,196 is shown for the 10 years. And
there is more than one indication that the
co. has given attention to its internal re-
serves in .that .period : the management must
have been wefl satisfied with its position
when it. brought £BO,OOO into the daylight
four years ,ago. Prefs. are excellently situ-
ated. Net jncome last year amounted to
almost five times the sum necessary for their
7 p.c. As for security, net tangible assets
visible after payment of final divs. were
equal to £3 15s. 2d. for each share.

"Sales continue satisfactory” is the one terse
message of the board to the shareholders.
Whether the point was taken off the div.
because the management was not impressed
with the outlook, or whether it was in
accordance with a plan to pursue a more con-
servative financial policy, is left unexplained.
All that is visible is net profit greater than
that of the previous term and a smaller div.

The expansion was financed by the co.’s
bankers, overdraft increasing by £35,466.
With £57,214 owing on open accounts,
£05,644 to the bank and £25,900 on mort-
gage, the management has something to
occupy its attention. Plant must be kept
up to date—expenditure there is essential.
Yet so long as the allowance out of earn-
ings against depreciation is adequate those
fat entries are quite all right ; the provision
for wastage is, however, not specified. Busi-
ness for the term was considered satisfactory
by the directors, hut gross profit was actu-
silly a few hundreds lighter than that claimed
for the previous term; it was a cut in some
of the expenditure items that gave a slight
increase in net profit.
The 100,000 £1 prefs. carry 6 p.c., but
share point for point with ordinaries beyond
that rate. Their div. is, on the co.’s record,
quite safe, net profits over the past 10 years
having averaged more than four times the
a.mount necessary. They are alsoAvell placed
as to security: at May 1 there were net
tangible assets with a book value of £414,276,
equal to £4 2s. lOd. per share. Profits have
fluctuated largely under the influence of
price variations in the commodities used in
manufacture, and that is a weakness which
the management has not hitherto succeeded
in controlling. Until the co. can be made
independent of that serious factor, the profit-
earning capacity of funds will continue to
vary. Divs. for the past six years have aver-
aged 71 p.c., but a shade better than that is
possible if earnings are maintained at the
levels of the past three years.'

Profits were well in advance of those for the
preceding term. But prefs. called for a full
year’s div., and the directors wisely cut the
appropriation for ordinaries back to 8 p.c.
The addition to reserves was £1863, making
the accumulation £3120; but as goodwill is
in the books at £22,682, £19,562 of capital
is still unrepresented by tangible assets.
Sales showed “an appreciable increase, de-
spite a general slackness in the building
trade” ; but it is doubtful whether any early
improvement in that trade can be looked for,
especially in view of the new Workmen’s
Compensation Act, which has a nsyeholbgr-
cal as well as material effect on industry.
Uortunately the co. hasn’t all its eggs in the
one basket; nevertheless the sooner goodwill
js wiped off and reserves built up, the sooner
will the co. be able to face anything in the
shape of a general set-back without pertur-
bation. Gross profits were £59,569 com-
paried with £53,033 for the preceding 12
months. Heavier provision had to be made
for taxation, but the increased business was
put through at a total expenditure of
£40,763 as against £42,050. During the term
the last ss. was called on the 4500 contribs.
and 2000 new shares were issued. The £3125
thus obtained was used to discharge a mort-
gage of £2466 and in the purchase of a
suburban freehold to house a new branch.
The increase of £2306 in sundry creditors
includes the balance due on the building now
being erected. Freeholds were £2171 greater
at £39,165. The financial position at April
30 was quite comfortable, there being £97,083
in cash, stocks and book debts to cover the
£30,405 of liabilities. Fixed assets and odds
and ends totalled £96,611. Property, plant
and machinery are reported to be in good
order; depreciation adequate; stock values
conservative: and provision for bad debts
ample. Both classes of shares are listed, and
as the prefs. are well secured- —there were
tangibles amounting to £146,911 for the
30.000 at April 30, equal to £4 17s. lid. per
share —and the interest rate attractive, they
hold around 2A. Ordinaries are not likely
to be popular until such time as reserves
are in excess of the goodwill item.

Early in the term the wasteful distribution
of the manufacturing was ended by bringing-
all factory activities under one roof, and
up-to-date kitchen facilities were installed
at the co.’s big cafe ; and increased business
is said to have also followed the expenditure.
Results were better, but there was nothing-
brilliant about the improvement. Certainly
the full benefit was not felt until the second
half of the term, but something better than
the slight increase shown might have been
expected. However, the Board eased in the
writing off and ordinaries come into the pic-
ture to the extent of a modest 2-J p.c.—the
firist since 1923, when 71 p.c. was paid. The
public is interested only in the prefs. Of
these there are 14,130, carrying 10 p.c. They
are fairly well supported, there being liquid
and semi-liquid assets at Feb. 28 amounting
to £7700 less £5055 to cover liabilities and
the distribution to ordinaries; a freehold
valued at £39,319 bearing a mortgage of
£15,000; and leasehold, fittings and plant
written down to £14,462 —in all a net
£40,419, equal to £2 17s. 2d. per share. The
writing off has been liberal. Stocks are
heavy considering the nature of the business,
and there was an increase from £4252 to
£5469 in the 12 months, Prefs. are well
secured as to div., the leanest year having
produced profit three times the amount neces-
sary to pay the 10 p.c. The current term
should show a definite improvement ; all the
present conditions, artificial and otherwise,
favor a business of this sort.

Several insurance companies now doing world-
business had their beginnings in Maoriland,
but for a long time the Provident was the
only Private-Enterprise life office with head-
quarters in the Dominion. The field was
well. covered-- by th’A Gpy.ernment insurance
department and the big mutual and pro-
prietary offices of Australia, and there was
little inducement for local promoters to, ven-
ture in. The Government office, however,
was cold-shouldering Industrial business, so
the Provident made a very cautious start in
that line alone. Presently, as every Indus-
trial office should, it offered its friends the
option of taking Ordinary policies; but pro-
gress was so slow that quite lately it '.was
still collecting little more than 1 p.c. of
the total Ordinary premiums paid in the
Rickety Isles. A glance at the tables indi-
cates the weary path that has to be trodden
by youngsters in this field.
The Provident took over the Provident and
Industrial in 1903, but it was still such a
midget that up to 1908 paid capital was only
£5250 ; it was increased to £lO,OOO when the
office invaded Australia. Smaller capital is
not, of course, a disadvantage from every
point of view; it may even be considered an
advantage. In fact, no share capital at all
would be the best thing if you could get as
good management and as good security with-
out it. Shareholders received 5 p.c. divs. up
to 1923, and only in the past two years have
they improved to 7 p.c. The smallness of
the payments is another feature which share-
holders in the too numerous recent cos. will
note without enthusiasm. Over the past half-
dozen years Provident shareholders could
have done almost as well out of gilt-edged
investments. Ordinary policies carry a
guarantee that at least 90 p.c. of profits
shall go to policy-holders. Accident and In-
dustrial policies are definite contracts, and
profits belong to shareholders. Now that the
rate of progress is hastening, div. prospects
are brighter but not brilliant.
Combining figures of the three departments
affords this illustration of the co.’s growth:

Industrial income has almost doubled in
eight years, and Ordinary more than doubled
in seven ; but that doesn’t mean great things,
because the figures to be doubled were small.
If. however, the business has not been very ex-
pansive it has not been very expensive. Ordi-
nary; expense rate last year was 17.9 p.c.-
about the average of recent years. On The
Bulletin's familiar 7 p.c. basis for bid busi-
ness, the new business cost w r as 99.7 p.c.
From that angle the tendency towards steady
increase is more clearly visible : three years
ago, for instance, the rate was 84 p.c. A
watch needs to be kept here. The volume
of new business is increasing only a little
each year, and until better things can be
done there the rate is hardly likely to im-
prove. Industrial showed out very well with
an expense rate of 89.9 p.c. In 1922 it was
42.4 p.c.; in 1920 45.4 p.c., while in 1913 it
was 60.5 p.c.
Paid capital is £21,000. Shareholders’
funds are included in the Industrial balance-
sheet ; the assets there at December 31
totalled £347,873, of which no less than
£316,044 was in cash or public securities, in-
cluding municipal and Harbor Board deben-
tures. The Ordinary and Accident balance-
sheet showed total assets of £257,372, of
which 91 p.c. consisted of public stocks and
cash. The management is not of the sort
that is likely to allow costs—especially Ordi
nary costs —to go unchecked, and that is the
point that calls for most attention.

Phenomenal wool prices inflated the 1925
figures, but: despite the return to normal
levels better [earnings were disclosed for last
year. Not that the net profit represents any-
thing amazing. The co. hqs the use of a
big volume of cheap capital: there is, for
instance, £249,840 of preference capital
carrying only 51 p.c. ; £348,288 of 5 p.c. (tax
free) perpetual debenture stock; £62,580 of
6 p.c. perpetu'al stock ; £2720 of 7 p.c. per-
petual ; £35,930 of 6 p.c. terminable stock:
and £128,675 of 7 p.c. terminable. Thus
favorably situated, and assisted by reserves
of more than £lOO,OOO, something better than
7 p.c. might be expected for ordinaries. Even
in 1920 —the peak of the post-war boom—
they received only 9 p.c., though in that year
£24,000 was extracted from reserves to
cancel founders’ shares which have since
ranked as ords. The divs. for the follow-
ing three years were not visibly earned :
and actually, net additions bo reserves
have amounted to only £17,971 in the past six
years. Considering the volume of liabilities,

the co/s bankers, plus the £164,665 in ter-

cent purchase. Book debts increased by
£210,799, with an unstated amount of re-
serves against them. Stocks were about
normal, the big figure for 1925 representing
an accumulation at the balancing date. The
co/s performance for the past two remark-
ably prosperous seasons reads very poorly.
Unless something very substantial is hidden
—and the Wild Cat can see no sure indica-
tion of it—the management will have to do
some brisk thinking if shareholders are to
receive regular feeds when the lean times
come.

Now that “Shark-eye” (Rill) Park has
reached Sydney with the thousands (some
say £50,000) he sluiced out of the Markham
(Mandated Territory), and the golden cat
is out of the bag, there are prospects of
trouble when the ’weight-chasers reach the
liver in a mob. When the late Sir William
Maegregor was surprised by the rush to
Sudest (Papua), he had the gumption to
adopt the Queensland Mining Act instanter.
But the legal luminaries at Rabaul decided
to draft their own mining laws. Whereas
every other Mining Act of the Australian
States provides that, before any area is
made available for the recovery of gold or
other mineral by dredging, such area must
be examined by a warden and decided to be
incapable of being profitably worked by any
other method, the locally-made article has
overlooked this wise and time-honored pro-
viso. The consequence is that every holder
of a miner’s right on the Markham is able
to hold 240 acres. A party of five men re-
cently got on to a new run of gold, and have
a claim five miles long! Parts of this river
have yielded up to 20oz. of gold (worth £2
12s. 6d. per oz.) to the dish. Another small
party gathered 700 oz. in three weeks: one
digger filled a 251 b. flourbag with chunks of
the yellow metal inside a week. Will the
eager men who spend hundreds of pounds in
equipment, and who wall have had to climb
and scramble for a week or more over
jungle-smothered mountains, recognise the
rights of the handful of men who have been
granted such ridiculously large areas? The
sooner the Commonwealth realises that a
mistake has been made by its agents, and
sends some quick thinker to deal with the
situation, the better it will be for everybody
concerned. Left as it now is, the Markham
rush will certainly result in injustice, and,
if badly handled, may easily lead to serious
trouble.
Wiluna ( W.A.) has decided to instal a
pilot-treatment plant. Some time ago man-
ager Vail said that values exposed at 300 ft.
would return a very handsome profit, and
that after further development the property
would easily provide from 40,000 to 50,000
tons a month for treatment. Since then
developments have backed up Vail’s opti-
mism.
* * * *
Lake View and Star's latest estimate of
ore reserves at 759,363 tons, worth 30s. 9|d.,
shows a reduction of 58,020 tons and a
decline in grade of 84d. compared with a
year ago. The falling off is accounted for
by the elimination of isolated blocks of high-
grade ore not immediately available for ex-
traction. At the last annual meeting bigger
tonnages and improved returns were pre-
dicted by chairman Collier, and director
Cordner James declared that the market was
going up. Shareholders were so overjoyed
to hear this that they voted the directors
an extra £lOO a year apiece and did without
a dividend themselves. As the outlook has
not improved as expected, it will be interest-
ing to see what happens at the next roll-up.
The Westralian Mine-workers’ Union
seems determined to deck the State’s gold-
mining with crepe. In a new log a claim is
made for wages ranging from £5 ss. for
laborers to £6 ys. for miners, and higher
rates for pitmen, pumpmen, etc. In addi-
tion district allowances ranging from 9s. to
30s. a week are demanded, as well as a 35-
hour week for underground and a 44-hour
week for surface-men. Mine-owners’ figures
show that if the log were adopted by the
Court working costs would be increased 3s.
2d. per ton ; and, as it is, only two big mines
in the State are paying their way and pre-
cious few small ones.
Fred Tricks and others have taken an
option on the Rising Sun, near Ivurnalpi
(W.A.), where an ounce reef is said
to have been exposed for several hun-
dred feet. The show is near a find
which Kalgoorlie boomed last year, and
which was alleged to possess a “huge rich
quartz blow.” Nothing, however, has been
said about this blow for some time.
* * * *
Mararoa (W.A.) struggles on. Share-
holders having jibbed at paying calls, the co.
proposes to ask the State Government for
more towards the cost of erecting new plant.
Meanwhile the old story about estimated pro-
fits and satisfactory developments is being
told; but the market refuses to believe a
word of it.

Rest wick, who inspects more new finds for
Adelaide than anyone else, is once more in
the West. This time his job is to view some
gold deposits at Sylvania, north of Mundi
Windi, on the road from Meekatharra to
Marble Bar. These deposits are on the
eastern boundary of a belt of greenstone,
and, according to Assistant-State Mining-
engineer Wilson, prospects are promising.
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) crushed 9444
tons at the old Cherry property, Ardlethan,
during the year to April 28, for 105 tons tin
concentrates, 66.22 p.e. metallic. Net profit
at £l7Ol looked Jean compared with £4315
during the previous term, and was carried
forward; £1938 of a debit brought in was
added to capital loss account, raising the
item to £109,396. Concentrates realised
£16,798, with a mine profit of £4620, but
administrative exes, took £ll3l, depreciation
£592, and £5Ol was allowed for income-tax.
Cash balances were £1633 at the end of
April, but £738 went out since to pay off the
balance of the purchase money due to the
Cherry people. Other visible assets were
£1152 worth of stores and £690 of odds and
ends. The 135,000 20s. shares are 18s. 9d.
paid, but only 57,564 are alive. The last
call, No. 14 of 3d., was made a year ago.
Carpathia (N.S.W.) still looks the best
of the Ardlethan shows. The last fortnight
gave five tons concentrates from 11S tons
of ore, an improvement on the 4| tons for
the previous half-month. Holders of the
44,000 contribs. paid to 7s. are at a double
disadvantage. In lean times they have to
find the cash to carry the 60,000 fully-paid
drones, and "when on payable lenses the bigger
half of the cake has to be handed over to
the same non-productive majority.

The manager of the Great Northern at
Herberton (N.Q.) is prospecting along the
porphyry dyke which appears to cut off the
rich shoot of tin. Below the 400 ft. crosscut
this dyke came in at sft., and the drive has
been deflected to pick up the ore on the
western wall. The last clean-up of 130 tons
gave 91 tons concentrates, averaging 74 p.c.
ore, and worth. £l2 a ton. The shoot will
spin a few dividends yet. Meantime other
prospecting work is on hand, and in the east
lode a 2ft. vein has been struck, with rich
ore well worth opening up.

Stanthorpe (Q.) tin returns look like buck-
ing up before the end of the year under the
stimulus of the high market. The Gap a
new area, which is to be hydraulically
sluiced, has been visited by the Minister for
Mines, and a number of tests carried out.
The wash will, it seems, give something like
21b. of tin to the yard. So far about 70
acres have . been tested, and geologist St.
Smith considers that everything points to
highly payable sluicing. Glen Aplin dredges
should also shortly augment the local output.

yellows and “fancies, ’ which can always

Erie Huntley’s story of the woes of the
New Guinea Copper would make the Sphinx
weep. First the Laloki caved in at 130 ft.
Then the pyrites combusted and the whole
mine had to be sealed up. Open-cut work
brought to light ore, but it was so Liable
as to be poor stuff for the smelter, and the
converter, getting only low-grade matte
feed, went short in efficiency. Next the
Dubuna caught alight; and open-cut work
has to be started there. All the ore got in
the year was 20,846 tons, of which Laloki
furnished 13.324 tons. Circumstances forced
the shipment of 6798 tons matte to Port
Kembla and 211 tons of blister. Later other
lots amounting to 2086 tons of matte and
32 tons blister also went forward. Of course
such a record blew finances to pieces. On
working account the debit is £82.739. The
co. had £60,398 of blister copper on hand at
the end of 1924 and only carries forward
£11,520, so that it lived a good deal on what
had gone before. Adding interest, directors’
fees and other small items, the total loss for
the year is £94.401—a hefty . bit to make
good. The co.’s debts are: Overdraft,
£137,362; sundi-y creditors, £24,936; and
£39.600 of bonds redeemable out of profits—
when they come along. What remains to be
set against the bills are reserves of ore of
211.000 tons, averaging 44 p.c. copper and
L’ldwt. gold, in the Laloki; and 31,000 tons
of 5 p.c. copper and 24dwt. gold in the
Dubinin; the reserves represent 11,000 tons
copper and 30.2500 z. gold. So far as the
fire goes, it won’t trouble these metals, but
the mine may have to be reopened below the
burning stuff. And still Erie Huntley isn’t
downhearted. When he gets his Dwight-
Lloyd sintering plant at work, he reckons
that he will snuff out the baleful glitter
of his evil star. What will remain for
shareholders afterwards is perplexing because
reserves are so small.

The Governments of the Malay States and
kindred tin-bearing territories are taking
heavy toll from Australian and other com-
panies operating dredges and sluicing plants
thereabout. The coolies, too, are demanding
higher wages. In this they are assisted by
the coincident rubber boom. The coolie isn’t
going to dredge oxide for the Tin King for a
return below that of his brother or cousin
winning wealth for the Rubber King in the
next paddock—and Australian directors see
lessened profits as a result of the develop-
ment. In striking net profits the cos. adopt
the plan of deducting the taxgatherer’s im-
post beforehand. Kota says that £7202, or
32.3 p.c. of working profits, was so absorbed
last year. Larut fared worse, losing 33.41
p.c. of its revenue by the process of
paying £6552 in taxation. Tupffi found
£11,164 gone west from the same epidemic,
or 23.55 p.c. The worst feature of these
figures is the fact that the toll is greater as
the co. is poorer. Larut, in a lean term,
contributes more than prosperous Tupai.
# # * *
Senior-Warden Greig, of the Federated
Malay States, in his report for 1925 refers
to the opening up of the big dredging areas
in the Kinta Valley and elsewhere, which
will go far to compensate for the decrease
from gravel pumps as they exhaust their
ground. The high and steady price of tin,
and the reasonable prospect of something-
still higher, has produced a condition of
prosperity and optimism. The exhaustion
of the alluvial deposits, which many have
forecasted for years, is still far off, although
the gravel-pumps will work out certain areas
within a comparatively short time. Mr.
Greig comments on the fact that plenty of
money is available for deep boring. “And.
thanks to the intelligent use of power and
courageous use of capital, mining schemes
are now being proposed and carried out on
a scale not dreamt of a few years back,
except in very favorable localities where
deposits were particularly rich." The small
miner is being replaced by large-scale
schemes which make a much more thorough
recovery—“all,” he adds, "to the good of
the country and the industry.” Dredges pro-
duced 19.7 per cent, of the total output of
45,926 tons in .1925, as against 21.8 per
cent, in 1924.

Were the Tongkah Harbor people asleep
during their five years’ search for a new
area? Austral Malay has been negotiating
for what seems a very good property at
Pungkah, only 60 miles away. And E. N.
Mulligan, on behalf of Burma-Malay, cables
that he has bored a property at Katu, about
five miles n.-w. of Tongkah, and has “proved
an area carrying 17,600,000yd5. just over a
pound average, 72 p.c. metallic, depth 34ft.,
soft bottom.” Mulligan adds that further
bores should materially increase the dredg-
able area.
* * * *
Kundang Tin, with £120,000 issued of its
£125,000 capital, has a curious, history, which
shows how interwoven these Malay enter-
prises are. Liddelow and Park put down a
first boring of 154 holes —average depth 34
feet —for a recoverable value of fib. of 72
p.c. black tin. Murray, late of Kamunting,
then bored it for Sime, Darby and Co., of
Singapore, who valued it at a little over lib.
They purchased and offered it to Austral
Malay for a big sum in cash, but no business
resulted. Alluvial Tin then got the offer,
and they optioned it to the late T. H. Mar-
tyn, arrangements being made for Alluvial
Tin to test the ground at Ratrut Basin's
expense. That boring, under Malcolm New-
man's eye, showed 20,000,000 yards going
.81b., and averaging 31ft. in depth. F. G.
Pratten and Newman then went in with
Martyn and C. H. Kerry on the board of a
million dollar (£116.666) co. Ratrut Basin
shareholders were offered 30,333 contributing
shares, with one fully-paid for each contri-
buting taken up. Ratrut (N.L.) also got
11,667 shares for its No. 2 dredge pontoon
and superstructure, and the subsequent sale
of this for £B5OO cash helped to buy a new
plant. Alluvial Tin got 17-000 fully-paid
shares, and Sime, Darby 22.500, also fully
paid. A contract for an up-to-date dredge
with buckets of 9 c. ft capacity, jigs and clas-
sifiers was placed at £32 500, c.i.f. Malayan
port. Proceeds frotn the extra 3333 con.
shares issued at 325. brought issued capital
to £120,000. This should enable the co. to
reach the producing stage (perhaps in Sep-
tember) without unduly heavy liabilities. Re-
covery of from 30 to 40 tons of tin per month
is expected. With the metal at £2OO London,
tins should show a profit of about £25.000
p.a.
* * *
Rawang (F.M.S.), once a sleepy Malayan
village, is now a prosperous mining town,
supplying the needs of the army of coolies
employed, by Rawang Tin, which owns 997
acres of its mining land, and is the only co.
operating in the district. The valley is said
to be subject to floods, and Rawang has
had a couple of experiences. Jack Atkinson,
formerly of Ardlethan and Emmaville
(N.S.W.), now Rawang’s general manager,
was greeted soon after his arrival by what
was said to be the biggest flood in the village’s
history. The large amounts spent in flood
protection had been wisely invested, and no
damage was done to the’ mine. Since the
close of the co.’s financial year on March 31
227 tons tin and a profit of £24,616 have been'
reported, and the included costs cover all
outgoings, even Sydney office exes, and direc-
tors’ fees. There are ample funds to pay
the shilling dividend (£12,000). F. G.
uln oni 1, ~o ne the vendors, who received
400,000 f.-p. shares, representing in the re-
constructed co. 50,000 £1 shares, and is said
to still hold the lot, is a pretty tight-fisted
chairman. He will most probably build up
a solid reserve before bigger dividends are
pain, as was done with Larut and Tupai.

“Pink Tape”: One of the most curious
inquiries received by the N.S.W. State In-

wanted cover for a servant and advice about
a doubtful employee. “This man,” she said,
“brings my husband home from the station

two shillings each time. Do I need to in-

“Old Nib”: A titled person with some
claims to be considered a bounder was at
a V.R.C. luncheon at Flemington one race
day. The late Byron Moore, who sat on the
other side of the table a bit further down,
had before him a bottle which the guest
reckoned must contain some particularly
choice vintage. Calling the waiter, he
offered him half a dollar to appropriate a
glassful of the private tipple while Byron
Moore wasn’t looking. And Jeames, with a
grin, complied. “What’s this?” gasped the
bounder as he tasted the liquid and made a
wry face. “Strained barley-water, with a
little coloring, sir,” the waiter explained
deferentially. But he didn’t offer to return
the half-dollar. + * *
“Hugh J.”: “Flagwagger’s” tribute to the
lionestv of the war-time postal officials who
delivered his ten-shilling notes (B. 24/6/’26)
sends me back to an episode of my boy-
hood I had been employed two days wearing
the seat out of my first pair of long ’uns,
when the accountant gave me a packet with
a narrow news wrapper gummed round its
middle and told me
to register it at
the G-P.O. On the
way I casually ex-
amined it. and saw
it was a bundle of
bank-notes. The
risk of carrying all
this wealth fright-
ened me, and I
hastened to be rid
of it. In those
days there were
two counters to be
approached. One

when I had re-

cess was over, I
dropped them into
the receiving-box
outside. I must
have turned a very
blank gaze to the
boss next day when
he asked for the
registration receipt,
and when I ex-
plained my method
of registration it
was a very agi-
tated old gentle-
man who towed me
along to the G.P.O. for information. Yet
the roll of notes reached its destination,
though everybody who handled that fat

“Jobber” : A learned Judge illustrated for
me the other day how differently two people

a pathetic tale
about how the
arresting sergeant
said to him:
“Smithy, I’m sorry
to have to take
you on a charge of
this kind: I knew
your poor old
father.” His Honor
was a bit doubtful
about the implied
certificate of good
character, ordered
the removal o f
Smithy, had his
cobber brought in
again and asked
him if he remem-
bered the sergeant
saying anything to
his mate when
arresting him. The
other bird remem-
bered without any
trouble. “Yes, yer

geant clouted

“Sixenate”: An entirely new version of
“East Lynne” will be staged in the Sydney
Divorce Court as soon as the overcrowded
list permits. The Lady Isabel of the piece,
tired of poverty with a shiftless sort of
husband, levanted with a rich, elderly in-
valid, who, flattered by her attentions, left
her most of his money when he died. Mean-
while her husband had obtained a divorce.
Returning to Sydney after a world-jaunt, the
lively lady hunted up her children, and found
her husband re-married and as out-of-work
as ever. She became a boarder in the family,
and, as she was free with monetary assist-
ance, was allowed to do much as she liked.
The second wife must have endured a good
deal in this curious position of affairs, but
she kicked when she discovered (as she
alleges) that her husband had given her
grounds to institute divorce proceedings, and
to cite the other woman as co-re. The family
burst-up has not reunited the original hus-
band and wife; she has taken the children,
but she disclaims any desire to regain the
husband —apparently she only wanted to
upset the domestic apple-cart of her suc-
cessor.

city, I tapped a telegraph-key for a crust.
One day a wire full of ardent love and hot
kisses came to my table. Probably by pre-
arrangement there was no signature. At the
conclusion of the transmission I tapped a
flippant comment to my colleague at the
other end of the line, and that matter-of-fact
but tired youth, missing my joke, wrote
down the composite word “Heesalier” as the
signature. Puzzled at the cryptic signature
and its sinister application, the fair recipient
sought a solution, the result being a some-
what caustic complaint to headquarters from
a wrathful lover. My next pay envelope
wasn’t so fat as usual.

“Up North” : It is risky to suddenly wake
a man who has fallen asleep with danger on
his mind. Once after we had been sniped
at all day, I roughly woke my mate at'mid-
night for his turn at picquet
duty. He was up and lunging
at me with drawn bayonet
even before he stood properly
upright, and our yells startled
a mile of outposts. A party
of ns volunteered for the risky
job of blowing up a Beersheba
bridge. We managed to creep
between the Turkish outposts
and rested in a donga. In-
structions were w hispered that
each man not watching should
sleep if he could, but in the
event of a patrol stumbling
across us we were to go to
it as silently as possible. Two
hours before dawn one of the
“suiciders” woke his mate.
Instantly clawing fingers fast-
ened on the bending man’s
throat, and he came near never
seeing the sun rise. In later
peaceful days, wdiile prospect-
ing towards the wild west
coast of Cape Yorke Penin-
sula, the niggers persistently
dogged our tracks. One of the
party became “windy” of this
unseen foe, and when awak-
ened to help round up the
horses he fired from his blan-
ket. The bullet, catching the
third man in the thigh, ended
the trip.

experience is that the landsman, lias no such
prejudices. During the military occupation
of Rabaul, I Was called to attend a'coolie,
He was in such a bad way that I gave in-
structions for his removal to the hospital,
Next morning two of his countrymen called
and announced that he had died before the
ambulance had come. There were no sus-
piqious circumstances, so an order was given
forthwith for burial; but when two days later
it was discovered that there had been no
Chinese buried, a health squad was de-
spatched to see what had become of the
corpse. They found it rolled up in matting
and stowed away under more matting in a
room in which most of the dead man's cob-
bers ate their meals and slept. The spokes-
man explained naively that they were saving
the corpse until Saturday afternoon to have,
a proper funeral, with fireworks, roast-pork
and the rest of the trappings. It was in
warm weather, too !

“Shed Hand”: (Generally, after pay-day,
a shunter or two fail to put in an appear-
ance for duty in our big goods-yard, and a
note is received by the office to say the man
is ill. As timekeeper I recently received a
less indefinite and more candid communica-
tion from one stay-away's wife. “Bill can’t
come to-day,” the brief epistle read; “he s
wet his whistle till it won’t blow.”

“Ex-Dig.”: The Sydney R.S.L. is trying
to unravel a knot which might easily be
more frequent than it is. A man died by
the roadside at Eastwood, and, believing him
to be a Digger, the League paid for his
funeral, subsequently claiming reimburse-
ment from Repat. llis employer had engaged
him as a returned man, and a fellow-worker
had recognised him as a member of the 9th
Battalion ; but Repat. said there was no re-
cord of a Christensen Melrose in that bat-
talion—-the nearest to the name was a John
Melrose—and refused to pay up. So many
Diggers enlisted under names not their own,
and so many have changed their names since
their discharge, that for a man to get astray
from his regimental records is not remark-
able. Quite half a dozen men whom I fra-
ternised with sufficiently to still remember I
now address by names which were certainly
not theirs on the other side. And I often
meet one man who (officially) is buried on
Gallipoli. Actually it was his father who
died at the Landing-—the son saw service
in France.

“Wang”: Talk about rotten luck! The
other Saturday afternoon, while a Melbourne
crowd was struggling to get into a football
match, a small rat-faced young man detached
himself from the swirl of humanity and
started to move hurriedly up the street. A
large citizen who had apparently been
absorbed in meditation on the other side of
the street promptly stiffened to attention
and made after him. The fugitive broke
into a run; the pursuer also speeded up.
Suddenly Rat-face ducked through the fence,
streaked across the park and disappeared
around the back of the football ground, with
the other still hot on his tracks. A few
minutes later the hare came loping around
the far side of the ground, and took his stand
on the edge of the crowd. The large gent,
was not far behind him, but he too pulled up
when his quarry did, and contented himself
with regarding the other intently. Then a
boy came rushing up, and after dodging in
PLACING BOB.
BOR: “Well, I'm pleased to have met, your charming wife,
Fred. You must be very jealous of her.”
FRED (confidentially) : “Well, I take care never to intro-
duce her to any man a sane woman’d be likely to
take a fancy to.”
and out, held out something to Rat-face.
“Here, mister,” he said, “I saw yer drop this
just round th’ corner a minute ago,” and he
thrust a wallet into the other’s hand. It
was then that the large man stepped briskly
up, and with a “So you're up to your tricks
again,” grabbed Rat-face and led him away.
“Struth,” said the hare confidentially to the
hound —“I’d like to have that kid in me
hands for three minutes.”

THE BALLAD OF THE CHEERFUL BANKRUPT.
[FOR THE BULLETI N.]
“The quarry who, hard pressed by the wolves,
seeks the shelter of the Bankruptcy Court, finds
that the production, of a fee of £3 los. is a necessary
preliminary to filing his petition.”
Debt and difficulty dog me,
And are always having pups;
Whips of ancient follies Hog me;
Sorrow offers bitter cups.
“File your schedule” friends ad.visc me,
“Wipe the slate, and start off clean.”
But I never feel quite bankrupt
Whilst I’m holding three-fifteen.
In financial mists of sorrow,
Undepressed 1 grope my way ;
And some newer debt I borrow
When some ancient one 1 pay.
Every clearance in the ledger
Must a celebration mean;
And I never feel insolvent
When I’m lord of three-fifteen.
Always careless ways have held me—•
Money comes and money goes,
Till stone-brokeness has compelled me
To view creditors as foes.
Oft their harsh pursuit so irks me
1 could seek the peace serene
Of the court that shields the bankrupt—
But I haven’t three-fifteen.
Yet the place that offers shelter
Never yet my face has seen
For I never feel quite bankrupt
Whilst I’m king of three-fifteen.

“Wang”: In a Melbourne court a week
or so back the presiding J.P. asked a witness
“Do you know the accused V” to which the
reply came, “I do now.” The J.P. looked
perplexed for a moment. “But I am in-
formed,” he continued, “that you have been
acquainted with him for a long time.” “So
I have, yY Worship,” admitted the'man in
the box; “but you asked me if I knew him.”
The J.P. grew irritable. "What do you
mean, sir? What’s the difference?” “In this
•case, y’f Worship,” the witness calmly re-
plied, “it’s 10 pounds. When I lent it to him
I was only acouainted with him; now that
I’ve tried to get it back I know him.”

“McDuff”: In out Melbourne suburb re-
cently a couple of lads were grabbed up by
the police for fighting in the street, and in
due course found themselves before the beaks.
The face of one delinquent was liberally
adorned with sticking-plaster; but push
etiquette caused him to refuse to say how lie
came by his injuries. After vainly trying
to penetrate the barrier of reticence, the
presiding- J.P. remarked, sarcastically, "I
suppose a bit of wood flew up, and hit you
in the face?” It was the prosecuting ser-
geant who chipped in : “That’s just what did
happen, y’r Worship ; the other chap had a
picket)”
“Henry Horsecollar” describes the place
where Elliott died :
If the gunman who bagged the mechanic in Cob-
ham’s aeroplane fired with deliberate aim, he was
such a remarkable shot that it would be almost a
pity to hang him (if captured) until he has iiad a
chance to represent his country in an international
rifle competition. Most likely, however, he was
merely like the nameless man (also still at large)
who drew his bow at a Venture on the field of
Rameth-Gilead, and made history by making an end
of King Ahab.
Mesopotamia is a place of dubious reputation
—especially the lower end. The Creation is'
said to have happened there, which was a bad
beginning. The Deluge is likewise alleged to have
begun there, and many’ interesting animals were
drowned. Whether they included Methuselah or not
is uncertain, but if the Grand Old Man Wasn’t'
among the victims of the famous wash-out, he died
just in time. Mesopotamia was, according to legend,
the scene of the first marriage, bigamy, minor sin,
drunk, serpent,’ murder and monarchy. The second
murder, according to a tradition mentioned in the
CIRUMSTACES ALTER FACES.
PAULINE: “Dick is bach from America, absolutely broke:
and so changed yon won’t know him, my dear.”
PAULETTE: “I’m sure I won’t —what would be the use?”
Douay Bible, also happened thereabouts. Lantech
had Cain pointed out to him by his caddy, light
porter or page as a wild animal (probably Pain,
in his sinful old age, went round on all fours),
whereupon Lantech slew the rare specimen for his
coi Lotion. Discovering with horror that the specimen
was his great-great-great-grandfather he walloped the
caddy to death. All manner of bad characters lived
in Mesopotamia—Assyrians, Babylonians, Arabs, Seljuk
Turks, Ottoman Turks and others, including Alexander
the Great. That absentee monarch died there after
drinking heavily, and left two Asiatic wives, a half-
witted illegitimate half-brother, an unborn half-
caste sOn and an army largely married to foreign
women.
During the Great War one British army
surrendered unconditionally to the enemy, and it
hauled down its flag at Kut, in the same ill-omened
region. The redeeming feature lay in the fact that
it was mainly a British-Indian army. In a narrative
of the campaign, about a year later, in which General
Maude, with an army which wasn’t so brown, captured
Kut and Bagdad and scared the Turk into a better
frame of mind, Lower Mesopotamia was described.
Its characteristics, as the expedition saw them, were
the ruins of old civilisations which generations of
Abduls had destroyed, duststorms above, and swamps
and bad characters below. It was so flat and feature-
less in places that British troops lost their way on
the plain in daylight, during the early mismanaged
campaign, while trying to locate the furrow in which
Abdul was lurking. In summer the flies died of
the heat. When the regular London-Canberra air
service is established the ’planes will probably take
a more northern track, and fly as much as possible
over Persian soil. The Persian is a decent sort whom
a white man can speak to.

“X2X”: 1 lespite many of the textbooks,
hereditary haemophilia—the tendency to
bleed on the smallest provocation —is not'
confined to males (B. 8/7,/’26). I know
of one family in which it occurs alternately
—-in males one generation, in females the next.
In the present generation three sisters are
afflicted. I have seen the fingers of one cf
them bleed after shaking hands with some-
body who had exerted no more than the
ordinary pressure. In the previous genera-
tion it was the males who suffered, and in
the one before that the females. Two of the
girls in the present generation are doctors,
and put their faith in calcium lactate, which
they take in 20-grain doses. This com-
pound is said- to supply the. blood; with
the coagnlative element which it requires.

“Kerys”: Talking of strange disappear-
ances, the eldest son of a M.L. family, a bril-
liant student of 20, walked out
of the house one morning and
never came back. All inquiries
proved futile, and in course of
time the heart-broken parents
abandoned the idea that lie
w r as alive. They died, and in
the old home there remained
a son and a daughter. These
had reached the sixties before
anything came to throw light
on the family mystery. Then
one wild, wet night they heard
a wheeled vehicle come out of
ihe ,storm and stop at their
gate, and a few minutes later
tin* brother answered p loud
knock at the door. He opened
it. just in time to see a cab
driving furiously away, and
found on the doorstep the
huddled figure of an old, grey-
haired man. A note in a
pocket told that the uncon-
scious derelict was the miss-
ing brother, and from his like-
ness to the father the old
couple did not doubt its truth.
They nursed the wreck anxi-
ously for a week, but he died
without regaining conscious-
ness, and despite extensive
police and private inquiry his
cs.re.er during the intervening
50 years remains a mystery.
“Adelaide”: The cussedness of things, as

The time for District Council nominations
in one ward closed without any nomination

contest for the single seat that any one of
them could have had when it was going
begging the previous week.

“X.D.” : The police in Australia are kept
busy returning absconded youngsters to their
parents ; but a lot of the adventurers remain
unlocated. Most of them are probably all
right, and may turn up again some day—
or may not. I know where one of them is—
a capable little 15-year-old who told me
his story under a pledge of secrecy. His
stepfather’s severity to him used to occasion
trouble between his mother and her husband,
so, satisfied that the pair would be happier
if he was out of the way, he decided to re-
move himself, got a job, and did not com-
municate with his home until be was able
to send a “note” back in a letter which gave
no details about where he was. The recent
disappearance of the 15-year-old son of a
Sydney family had one curious effect; it re-
minded his father that he had done the same
thing at. the same -age, and he forthwith
determined to write to his own parents in
England, with whom he had not corresponded
since lie bolted from home. He had at first
feared being dragged home if he sent word
back; then he decided that it would be best
fio remain silent altogether—and his resolu-
tion only broke down after 22 years.

' .“Rabarak”: Speaking of well-preserved
corpses (B. S/7/'26j. I wonder how many
Diggers visited St. Michael's Church in
Dublin. In the crypt there is quite a heap
of human bodies, some of which, according
to the verger, have lain there for centuries
(the church is about a thousand years old).
Most of them are intact, and the skin
appeared as though it had been through a
tanning process. Our party was also shown
coffins that had been placed there up to
within a few’ months before our visit; and
there was nothing to indicate decaying con-
tents. The verger told us that scientists had
tested the crypt by placing fresh milk and
meat there for a month, and at the end of
that time they remained quite fit for human
consumption. He further assured us that
the church was built on the site of an ancient
oak forest, and that no germs could exist
there.. We gave him two bob, and reckoned
he had earned it. But I can swear to the
corpses;

“Machete” : If the new regulations under
the Produce Agents Act do no other good,
they at least settle, for N. S. Wales, the
long-debated question whether the tomato is
a fruit or a vegetable. This casus belli,
which has parted more friends than the Ama-
teur Status, has been ended by Acting-Min-
ister for Agriculture Lang with characteristic
dogmatism, and henceforth, from the Murray
to the Tweed and from Broken Bay to
Broken Hill, the tomato is a fruit. Lang
can. at any rate, call Webster to his support,
whereas the “Encyclopedia Britannica”
meanly faces both ways by declaring that the
tomato is a fruit which is highly esteemed as
a vegetable.
“H.S.”: Surveyor Lovett, for whom the
naming of the Mt. Victoria of to-day is
claimed by “T. 0.1.” (B. l/7/’26), could
hardly have conferred on it its. first name of
Mount Vittoria. He was not on duty in
that locality until April, 1832, whereas Major
Mitchell referred to it as Mount Victoria in
1830. He wrote to the Colonial Secretary
in June of that year: “I have much satis-
faction in. being able to state that I have
succeeded in finding a very favorable descent
from the Blue Mountains, the point of hill
by which the descent may be effected being
parallel to mounts York and {Clarence. I
have named it, for the sake of distinction,
Mount Victoria.” Again he wrote on July
4, 1830 : “The morning fine, set out with
men and axes, and soon found the best
descent from the mountains to be along the
tongue on the southward of Mount York, by
which a gently-inclined line of road could
be made by lowering a narrow crest of loose
rock which joins two parts of the ridge to-
gether. This, when the work was completed,
was named after the young princess, follow-
ing the order of royal names in that locality.”
Again, if Major Mitchell had used the name
“Vittoria” for this mountain, he would
hardly have applied it, as he did, to a town-
ship further along the Bathurst-road.

“Moreton”: The longest-headed farmer of
a German settlement in the Burnett district
(Q.) called liis compatriots together and pro-
posed that they should hold a working fee
and build a Lutheran church. They co ild
build it on his land, he said, provided he
was allowed to occupy it when it was not in
use as a church. His proposition was agreed
to, the church was built, and services .were
held in it whenever itinerant ministers visited
the district. Then came the war, and the
congregation was scattered. The church was
closed —as a church- —and the farmer was
left with a substantial barn which had not
cost him a penny.

“Herodot”: Here is a psychological
puzzle—an Australian family which has
been all but exterminated by its suicidal pro-
clivities. Grand-dad blew out his brains 50
years ago. He left live sons and three
daughters, none now alive. Two of the sons
and one of the daughters took their own lives
by various methods. Amongst the third
generation there have been three suicides, the
last one only a few months ago, and one
attempt at self-destruction. Now the mem-
bers of this family are not gloomy or mor-
bid, and some of those who have pushed
themselves out have been more than com-
monly bright.

“G.H.M.”: Attempts are being made to
stimulate the consumption of fruit in the
U.S.A. Judging by what lias happened in
the case of whisky, the best way would be
to prohibit it altogether.

“Akran” : A humorist of the sort that is
lucky to escape lynching turned up at a
North Coast (N.S.W.) dance on a recent
night. The cars and carts and buggies of
the dancers were all parked in the one place.
One horse had not been removed from the
shafts, and the joker tethered the back of
the buggy with a thick rope to a big Hudson
car. The latter was first to get in action
after the hop, and the sight of a car dragging
a trap and horse backwards set the other
prads playing up. It was a stout rope, as it
held for nearly a hundred yards before the
occupants of the car saw what they had in
tow. Getting out to sever the connection the
driver scared , the nag and off he shot, this
time with the ear in tow; and the two con-
veyances were, well off the road before the
mischief was undone.
“M.G.S.”: Melbourne’s record land sale

There is a sort of relation between that
figure and the land deal the enterprising
Batman carried through with the aboriginal

The death of Alorris Gotthelf removes the
elder of two patriarchs of Sydney Jewry
who have been presidents of the Great Syna-
gogue and in their old age were made
honorary life members of its hoard of man-
agement. Gotthelf was two years the senior
of George Judah Cohen, who is. 84. He
arrived in Australia as a young man of 20,
and founded the firm of Feldheim and Gott-
GEORGE A. BROADBENT, the Vie. map-
man, the southern authority on roads,
tracks and scenery, and tourist officer
of the R.A.C.V.
helf, and, although thereafter mainly
absorbed in business, he was interested in
many charities and was a broad-minded
man. When Charles Kingston, as first Fed-
eral Minister of Customs, came to Sydney
Town Hall to explain his tariff proposals,
some of the wholesale houses inspired their
staffs to go along and howl him down, and
it was reckoned that something dreadful
would happen to Coates, now M.L.C., then
a traveller for Feldheim and Gotthelf, who
occupied a seat on the platform. But Gott-
helf wasn’t built that way—all that hap-
pened to Coates was a hint that his chief
admired his grit and independence.
It should be dawning upon far-sighted
parents that an office-boy’s job with a strong
trade union is a stepping-stone to political
greatness. To mention a few, N.S.W. Min-
ister for Justice McKell got his grip on
polities as a clerk in Sydney Trades Hall;
Percy Coleman started the career which has
made him an AI.H.R. in the Seamen’s Union
office; J. F. O’Reilly, who is always on the
brink of a fat appointment, served his
apprenticeship in the office of the Hair-
dressers’ Union; J. G. Ilalliday, employees’
representative on the Workers’ Compensation
Commission, gets his £lOOO a year at the
age of 28 after spending half his lifetime in
the office of the northern branch of the
Aliners’ Federation.
The tyros at Point Cook had some trying
moments when they had to make their first
leaps from an aeroplane with a parachute,
but none had a more thrilling time or showed
more coolness than Flying-Officer H. D, L.
AlcGilvery, who passed his test last Week.
He hopped out at 2000 ft., but when he pulled
his rip cord the umbrella opened only half-
way and then twisted. AlcGilvery had an
emergency parachute, but he didn’t worry.
He just went on dropping, calm in the
assurance that his first sheet-anchor would
hold at length. At 1000 ft. it did so, and he
pulled up with a jerk, twisted gently in the
air, and made a graceful finish. It needs
some nerve to do a thing like that.
The Gaunt family, once of Victoria, but
now widely scattered, has broken out in a
new place with the appearance of Launcelot
as the entrepreneur of unbreakable gramo-
phone records. He is the youngest son of
the Judge whose family included two admirals,
Ernest and Guy, both knighted; Lieut.-
Colonel Cecil Gaunt, who won the D.S.O. in
the Big War; and novelist Mary, besides
others. Like another brother, Clive, Launce-
lot followed in the steps of his parent, and
studied law. He practised first ’in “the
East” and later in England, but is man-
aging director now of an English concern
which reckons it can make gramophone
records very cheaply out of waste paper.
The Dr. Buckley, Turkington whom the
women voters of Auckland recently chose to
contest a seat in the Reform interests at
the next election is better known in Sydney
as Dr. Emma Buckley. She has been prac-
tising in Auckland for the last few years,
and, as in Sydney, takes a leading part in all
matters aft'ecting women.
Frank Tate, Vic. Director of Education,
who is now royal commissioning in Fiji for
the Crown Colony Administration, will be
off to the Cold Land in April next to help
run the education conference. If there is a
spare 1v.8.E. about then he may get it. He
will by that time be 64, and will be com-
pleting 50 years' service in the department.
Possibly the conference will be his official
curtain.
Jack Morrissey, who died the other day
at Blandford (N.S.W.) after winning a
place in the ranks of squatterdom, began to
earn his living in ’76 as an assistant in the
Catholic School at Kyneton (Vic.). Among
the things he learned there was pig-raising,
and later he found the side-line far more
profitable than his profession. The school-
master in him could not be suppressed, but
he took men instead of kids for his pupils
and astonished them by the facility with
which he could talk on a wide range of sub-
jects. Result: Election to Vic. Assembly,
first for Rodney, then for Waranga. As
Rodney’s rep. has a kind of pre-emptive
right to office (witness, Gillies, Webb and
Allan) Alorrissey, of course, became a Alin-
ister, and lasted 18 months in charge of
Agriculture under Turner and Peacock.
Handicapped by dyspepsia, he threw up poli-
tics in 1907, and started to annex large lumps
of N.S.W.
There were no sensations in Afaoriland’s
share of the Birthday gauds. Bill Massey’s
widow got the feminine equivalent of the
knighthood that William was big enough to
dodge and became a first-class Dame. Charlie
Statham, now firmly in the saddle as Speaker,
got the K.B. His only mate at the sword-
tapping was another Charlie, Holdsworth,
who as the executive head of the Union
Steamship Company has always en-
deavored by promptitude, civility and strict
attention to business to preserve to the co.
the very snug position it occupies in the
world’s carrying trade. A trinket that had
to do with the Dunedin Exhibition was the
C.B.E. that went to Charlie Speight, whose
name is better known to Alaorilanders than
all the rest of the folk on the list put to-
gether. He brews the strongest beer in the
Wobbly Islands—and the Islanders insist on
having beer that is beer.
Gov.-General Stonehaven knows his part.
Interviewed by Brisbane pressmen on a
sunny morning, and urged to throw a
bouquet at Queensland’s winter climate, he
declined to express an opinion. “I always
avoid making comparisons,” he said. It was
just as well, too. for that afternoon, when
he had to do a job of tree«-planting for the
Anzac Memorial Avenue, the rain poured
down in torrents, and the G.-G. worked the
trowel with cold water running down his
back.
Never before since the establishment of St.
Vincent’s Hosm'tal, Sydney, by the Sisters of
Charity in t l, early ’fifties had they such a
rectress as just dead Alother Alary Adrian Fish,
daughter of an old-time Bathurst (N.S.W.)
family whose head was an engineer and imple-
ment manufacturer. She completed her
training as a nurse in St. Vincent’s, and
then joined up in 1906. Her first charge
was the Hospice for the Dying, and the
organising for the new private hospital.
Having done these successfully, she in turn
opened up successfully new hospitals in Lis-
more and Bathurst, and was brilliantly
administering the affairs of the nursing end
of the Order when a weak heart ended it
all at 50 years.
The last sketch David Low made in Aus-
tralia was this of his old colleague “Hop”
(Livingston Hopkins), who threw a good-
natured joke at his 30th milepost as he
passed it one day last week. He is still in
excellent health, and, though he doesn’t give
his inimitable pencil much use these days,
The Bulletin has hopes of printing more
than one of his drawings during the next
12 months.
The most ancient sin-sliifter in R.C. in-

Fras. at Drogheda. Later he was in Rome,
and, coming to Sydney in 1880, went to the
Eastern Suburbs, the headquarters of tin
Franciscans in Australia, and his stocky
figure has been well known there ever since.
Not having a street to spare to call after
J. G. Beaney, who was one of Melbourne’s
foremost meds. in the late ’eighties, the City
Council has put his name on the lane be-
tween the building in which he reigned and
the Y.W.C.A. hostel in Russell-street. When
he had made his pile Beaney managed to
get into the House of Landlords in ’B3, and
kept company with squatters till ’9l, when
he got a transfer to the Elysian fields. But
if there isn’t much to recall him in Mel-
bourne, there is a rather attractive tablet to
his memory in Canterbury Cathedral, in the
Cold Land.
Northern _ diggers lost a staunch friend
and the Alines Department a good officer
when J. J. Moran, P.AI. and Cooktown
Warden, passed out the other day. His
heart was in the North, and prospectors and
miners found him an ever-ready friend. It
was his dream to see the opening-up of a
new Palmer, but the ambition was never
realised.
Passed unexpectedly at 63, following an
operation at a Melbourne private hospital,
John Kidston Reid, for 30 years clerk of
Tas. Assembly. An ideal public servant-
courteous, capable and diplomatic—Jack
Reid will be gratefully remembered by poli-
tical and other associates. He was an inter-
state footballer in his younger days, and for
the last 20 years a pillar of St. Andrew's
auld kirk at Hobart, where Di*. Scott, his
father-in-law, ministered for a generation.
However well known Paterson, the new
Federal Alinister for Alarkets and Aligration,
may be to some Gippsland electors and the
House of Reps., he is a stranger to most of
the members of the Vie. Parliament. He
represented the Bruce-Pages at the State
dinner to Baron Somers the other night, and
was given a seat nearer his Ex. than Chief
Sec. Argyle. “Who is that between Argyle
and Bowser?” was a pretty common ques-
tion. Somebody suggested that he was
Somers’s A.D.C., and the idea was only dis-
carded because he had no fancy facings to
his swallowtail.
Vic. Education Department’s travelling
scholarship has gone this year to J. Mcßae,
chief inspector of schools, one of the best
of its own trainees. Beginning as a country
ped. in the Creswick district, Alcßae forced
the department to take notice of him. He
was given opportunities to go through the
University, and was placed in charge of a
special training-school at Kew. Then came
inspectorial work and the job near the top.
He is 55, but looks younger. His wife died
a tew weeks ago, and the eight months’ tour
will not be amiss. Peacock and Tate are
very considerate in managing little things
like that.
Flight-Lieutenant Davidson, who took part
in the first parachute descent from an aero-
plane at the Point Cook Flying School, is the
grandson of a man who was manager of
Phackaringa station in the ’seventies and
eighties, before Broken Hill was found out.
He had wandered all over the Hill, which
formed part of the adjoining station (Alt.
Gipps) long before its valuable contents were
dreamed of, and could have had a share in
the original claim for a song. The young
bird man’s father is Jack Davidson, manag-
ing director of the Adelaide News and vari-
ous other papers.
Young scientist Pat Murray—Oxford gave
him his B.Sc. and Sydney has just made
lnm a doctor—is the youngest Australian
to reach this height. He comes of a dis-
tinguished family. His father, S’Hubert.
who governs Papua and writes books about
the native, was a brilliant scholar of his
day at Oxford as well as a fine boxer, while
his uncle is the Gilbert Murray who trans-
lates the tragedies of old Greece. Pat is
25, tall and slight, with the scholar’s stoop
and the dreamer’s eye. He is six-feet-two,
but his athletic father beats that. Terence
Aubrey Murray, one-time Speaker of the
N.S.W. Assembly, was the scientist’s grand-
father.
Ex-Premier Gillies does not often shine
on the Queensland Board of Trade, but he
threw in a witty interjection tlie other day.
Ah argument was in progress as to whether
a sugar-mill tramway had not been con-
verted into a railway when the line had been
relaid with longer sleepers and heavier rails.
The C.S.R. Co.’s advocate contended that the
length of the sleepers was immaterial, while
the A.W.TJ. representative insisted that the
old 4ft. 6in. sleepers were for a tramway,
and the new 7ft. leepers were for a railway.
“With how much of that argument do you
agree?” Justice Webb asked the C.S.R. man.
Then Gillies jumped in with his first joke
on the Bench: “He agrees with 4ft. Gin. of
it.”
It was John Bowser who gave Frank
Clarke, McPherson and McWhae their first
chance in politics in 1917. When he formed
his Administration of Economy he picked the
three out of the ruck, and they all went far.
Each has been knighted, but Bowser, who
made them, is still waiting.
TAKING T WITH IT.
“I haven’t seen your wife playing bridge
lately.”
“No. She's trying her hand at playing
Bridget.”
At the age of 82, George Heightman, of
Lithgow (N.S.W.), is unwillingly admitting
that it is time to leave off, though until
recently he was the most regular man of
his shift. It is 66 years since he started
to hew- coal in Lancashire; as far as the
records can be dredged, no other miner in
Australia has given more than 60 years’ ser-
vice to King Coal.
THE RELUCTANT PIONEERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Hughes said that Australia was founded on
migration, though some of those who turned their
talents to making this country what it is came here
reluctantly (laughter).”
Picked immigrants and packs of them, assisted ones,
whole stacks of them,
Assisted somewhat forcibly, if they were reckoned
slow;
With no new lands a-ealling them or wanderlust
enthralling them,
They marched aboard reluctantly a century ago.
No torch of ’venture lighted them. No glowing urge
incited them
To build a newer Britain up at the Antipodes.
They left the old regretfully and, one conjectures,
fretfully,
With curses on the heads of those who sent them
overseas. •
They went in grief acute from it, their land. They
got the boot from it.
Yet patriotism of a sort their memory embowers.
They left it at the back of them the better for the
lack of them,
They left it for its benefit—and, it would seem, for
ours.
Who had the stuff in readiness to tame strong wills
to steadiness?
Who lost a birthstain in the wash? Ah, there’s
a poet knows.
Who, tactless, made a song of it, and missed his
step along of it ?
Well, there’s an injudicious earl can tell you, I
suppose.
Who were averse and sad to come? Who came
because they had to come?
Who made withal a better land for such as me
and you ?
No need to ask. Here’s luck to them whose country
gave the chuck to them—-
The first assisted immigrants Australia ever knew !

THE VICAR: “MacDougal, for a man that’s just won the motor-car
in the church art union, you’re looking awful glum!”
MAC : “Och, aye. Ye ken, I bought twa tickets—an’ that’s sixpence
thrown awa!”
“Andean”: A howl of indignation has
arisen from Bungaree and other Victorian spud pro-
pagating centres over the arrival of a small consign-
ment of M.L. tubers alleged to be affected with
corky or powdery scab. Meanwhile a big shipment of
Chilian oats which blew into this port (Melbourne)
a few days ago seems to have been overlooked by'
the cockies. If this cargo of grain is distributed
here it will mean a heap of trouble for Australia.
According to my observation on- the spbt, -the Chilian
farmer is the, most, careless of men in his . methods
of chltivatioiiy’aiid his crop usually contains speci-
mens of most indigenous weeds as well as many
imported ones. He has one particularly virulent curse,
a giant weed closely resembling the Noogoora burr,
which, if introduced here, would make sheepbreeders
sit up and howl, for it flourishes just as well in
temperate regions as in the warmer latitudes. There
is little room to suppose that the shipment under
notice is any cleaner than the output of the average
Chilian “farm.”

“ Jeauong’’: The really happy thought of
crossbred goannas doing useful work for man (B.
17/6/’26) reminds me of what happened over the
border (N.S.W.y last week. One Of the new improved
Ford ears was hung up for lack of petrol. “No
need to worry,” said an old bushman, “catch a
goanna and use his fat.” This was done, and the
car ran splendidly, its only fault being a tendency,
to dart into the scrub and run up trees, when meeting
strangers. ’
* * * #
“Really”: Recently we put a clucky hen,
a big black orpington in fine feather, on a clutch
of eggs. In a week’s time her tail began to shew
a bedraggled appearance which became more ai» as
time went on. The clutch was placed in a basket
with a sack under and around it to keep in the
heat. Towards the end of three weeks, the hen’s
tail was such a wreck that only the stumps of the
feathers showed. She seemed uneasy, but stuck to
her task and brought out the chicks. We then -shifted
her to a fresh nest and in doing so found that a
mouse had established a beautiful lying-in hospital
under the old hen’s bed, using tow scraped from the
sacking, and lined with tail feathers.
* * * *
“Wingella”: “Sylvester” (B. 8/4/’23)
says mango-trees are difficult to transplant.
Here in the N.T. we transplant these trees
easily when and where we wish. I carried one, then
a sapling about 10ft. high, oveu. three miles, . from
a gully to a hilltop. After four years the tree was blown
down in a gale. I then sawed off the limbs and
the broken roots and transplanted it to a slightly
lower level. There it was blown down twice before
it got firmly rooted, but notwithstanding all this
knocking about it flourished, and now is bearing fruit
again. But it is not free from pests; white ants
reckon mango-tree the daintiest dish on their menu,
especially if it is well-grown and in full bearing.
* * * *>
“Thirsty” : Recently an eminent geo-
physicist of the U.S.A. predicted that in a com-
paratively short time the States will benefit by the
addition of a large area which is slowly but surely
coming to the surface in the vicinity of Hawaii.
This upward movement of the Pacific bed is not
confined to the region he indicates; for some time
now the natives of Torres Strait have been
. drawing attention to
the shoaling of th?
waters round their
islands, particularly in
'the central group on
the eastern side of the
long Warrior Reef
running almost north
and south between New'
Guinea and Cape York,-
and round thos.e
lying, close to New
Guinea itself. Luggers
i;ow find that they arc
unable . t.O; navigate
passages which they
passed through with
plenty of water to
spare years ago. Be-
tween some of the
islands on a fine day
at low tide a man can
now almost walk across
the long stretches of
sandbank and reef. It
was thought at first
that the ordinary
growth of coral reef
might account for the
shoaling of the waters ;
but that the movement
is light from below
seems to be indicated
by the fact that
wrecks, old anchors
and so on, which were
tucked snugly out of
sight 10 or 15 years
ago, are showing up
at low tide. Off
Stephens Island the
masts of a ship are
now well above the
water, whereas a dozen
years ago only boys
swimming for shell
were aware that the
wreck was there. If
this continues, Aus-
tralia will before long
have another nice slice of land to add to her
tropical North.

“Rix”: A Corindhap (Vic.) farmer has
little faith in new blood applied to farm labor.
Delegating the job of digging out a rabbit warren
to a chap from abroad, the farmer was surprised when
dinner hour and the newcomer arrived together,
the latter remarking, “By goom, Ah reckon them
bunnies be well settled!” “Did you dig th’ lot
out?” inquired the farmer. “Doori better un thart,”
boasted ehoom, complacently; • “Wen Ah doog down
a bit, I strikes a fox as were coiled up in a kinder
skittle-alley. So, as th’ ferret an’ th’ fox-terrier
wanted ter ’ave er go, I earths ther bang lot up
tergeyther 1”
THE ADVANTAGES OF WINTER.
“Doan’t ’ee feel cold gain’ ’bout this weather with no jacket up?”
“Not a bit, maister. An ’ what I do like ’bout winter es, if you do be cold, you can sit
by fire and warm up, but in summer you caan’t sit by fire and cool down.”
“Bullwlianger” : In Balmain (Sydney)
the other day I came across an old cobber of mine.
This was Lever Brothers’ Solomon Island copra steamer
Ivobfloko, lying at Chapman’s yard. Built by Morrison
and Sinclair in the early days of the century, the old
packet saw' stirring times in the Western Pacific
and carried countless tons of copra and ivory nuts.
She was also a successful recruiter. In the Santa
Cruz group, where the firm had a trading station
at Grasciosa Bay, she was nearly captured by the
lads of the village, who evidently regarded her
presence as an intrusion, and she only got away by
slipping her anchor. She came to Sydney last year
for an overhaul, but it is doubtful if Levers will
send her back, as most of their copra is now shipped
at the plantations by the regular Sydney steamers.
She became a cobber of mine when a couple of years
ago she picked up at Santa Cruz a shipwrecked
crew of which I was a member. Her smoke over
the horizon made the most beautiful picture of our
lives —we had just broached the last tin of our
tobacco.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: On the far . N.S.W. South
Coast I recently came across a man in a sulky
driving a horse that had its ears tied together fairly
tightly. I had a yarn with him and he told ms
that when he bought the animal it was a bad rusher.
Other methods of teaching it better manners had
failed, and as a last resort he had tried tying the
horse’s ears together. The experiment was a complete
success. Personally I am inclined to think this method
would tend to frighten the average bad horse and
make him more unmanageable.
* * * *
“Lilli-pilli”: They were discussing the
tenacity of life in certain land and sea creatures, when
“Big Bill*’ had his say. “Them tortoises is tough.
Remember that Sunday I went fishin’ ? Well, I
gets down to the big hole in the crick, slings me
line in and starts to get bites right away. Little
bites they was—just shook the cork —but enough ter
kid a man there was somethin’ there, an’ all the
time me bait was gettin’ took. At last, just as I
was gettin’ full of it, I gives a tug and feels some-
thin’ on! It was one of these here tortoises. I
slung it as fer from the crick as I could an’ went
on with the fishin’. Presently T hears a rustle
behind me an’ thought it was a snake; but it was
the bloomin’ tortoise makin’ back fer the water.
I collars him an’ hoys him back agen. Three times
he done that, and three times I slung him as far as
I could. The fourth time he come back I thought
I’d fix ’im for good—took ’im back from the
bank a bit an’ chopped his head off. At sundown
I rolls up to come home, and, blow me, just ns
L turns to leave the crick there.’s;_.the. bloomin’
tortoise makin’ back fer the-water again!” - ‘‘With-
out his head, Bill ?” someone asked. “No,” replied
Bill, earnestly, “he had his head with him —he was
carryin’ it in his claw like a lantern and walkin’
on three legs. I let him go; he had me beat:”
“C.C.” : .4 propos the curious finds dis-
covered within newly-caught sharks, fishermen at
Thursday Island some time back brought to light
from the interior of one specimen a rubber mat of
the type used in motors and about 3ft. across.
Where the sea-pirate collected the trophy is a
mystery. It was at the same island that a China-
man, falling overboard from a steamer one evening,
was gathered in by sharks, A rumor got about
that he was wearing a gold watch at the time, and
lines were at once got out and several hauls made.
Dissection revealed the whereabouts of most of the
missing man’s body,- but the maneater that had
collected the watch wasn’t found.
THE EYE TEXT.
STOUT LADY : “Do you think yon could see
me across the street, young mini?”
POLIOEMAN : “Sure, Mum; I could see yes
from here to Port Darwin.”
“Tomb”: The fickleness of fortune was
exemplified at Neyv Zealand Gully (Q.) recently.
An old miner had worked a tunnel for five years
for practically nothing. He threw it in last Decem-
ber, and in January two prospectors had a go at
it. On their first day they took out over 50oz.
of gold from the wall, where the old man had
missed it by a couple of inches.
(Continued on page 24.)
THE CURRAWONGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, while the salt-white frost lies thick
On limb and leaf and grass,
Tlie currawongs are calling loud
To sleepy lad and lass —
The currawongs, the currawongs,
Who have nor place nor time
For drowsy folk who lie a-bed
At morning’s lustrous prime.
‘■‘Come roam, come roam!” they seem to call,
Call merrily and clear;
And who is he so drugged with sleep
Who will not wake and hear?
“Come roam, come roam!” now near, now far,
■ They cry, a sprightly throng;
And who is she so deaf and dull
Who will not hear their song?
Now, those who heed the currawongs,
While thick on blade and stem
The frost lies white, will quit their beds,
And up and follow them;
They’ll follow, follow, light of foot
Through bushland greens and greys,
The morning birds, the morning breeze
A-down the Open Ways.
They’ll need no blankets, coverlets,
To keep them warm and snug,
For widespread sunshine, rich in heat,
Shall be their golden rug ;
And, if they crave to drowse awhile,
Their couch shall be full soft—
’Twill be of grass and bracken made,
With dancing leaves aloft.
The frost lies light on road and track,
Lies white on rush and reed,
And fools are they, and fools are all,
Who, hearing, will not heed—
Who will not heed, but lie a-bed,
Bond-slaves to hearth and home—
The currawongs, the currawongs,
That erv “Come roam, come roam!”

“Jesmond”: “Jimpey” (B. 17/6/’26) lias
been using the wrong bait for sea-water mullet.
Sea-lice are the best for the purpose, but common
blowfly maggots come a close second, and for good
■work a fine hook and catgut are necessary. This fish
may be caught from the beach, with a rising tide,
or from a boat, using a line alone; or it may be
taken with a rod from a jetty, or from a bridge over
a tidal river. In every case the line should be
thrown out as far as possible. Fishing from boat
or beach my plan is to coil the line on my left arm
—not round the arm, but laid on it- —so that it
runs out freely when thrown by the right hand.
By these means, and with an incoming tide, I have
hauled them ashore by the score at the back beaches
of Phillip Island and San Remo (Vic.).
“Narara” : If “Jimpey” goes the proper way about
it, catching sea mullet on a line is a simple matter.
I have frequently caught them at Port Hacking,
Terrigal, Broken Bay, Bermagui and Karooma
(N.S.W.). My method is to bait a hook with dough,
remove the sinker and allow the line to float on the
surface well away from the boat. If there are any
small mullet about not gorged to repletion, they
will rise to the surface and take the bait. Big sea
mullet, however, are wary and will seldom if ever
bite.

“Erk'’: One of our new recruits was a
nice clean little chap and was immediately com-
mandeered by my wife as a house-boy. It was
his virgin trip to the coast from the bush of one
of the Solomons, and his saucer-eyes still told their
tale of wonderment. To this piccaninny the greatest
marvels among the plantation equipment were
our gramophone and sewing-machine—particularly
the former. We had two visitors, and my wife,
having at great pains showed him how to make
tea, instructed him to prepare it and serve master
and missus. Saucer, as we called him, brought
five cups to the verandah and my wife remon-
strated with him. “Why you bring five cup? Only
four missus and master stop.” Saucer shyly pointed
to the gramophone, from which Caruso was bawling.
“Missus, me bring one-phellcr cup for master who
stop in bokus,” he explained.
OBJECTIVES.
NEW PARSON (becoming acquainted ) : “And what is your chief
aim in life?”
HENPECKED HENRY: “Dodging the wife's.”
“Caesar" : If “D’loo" is still troubled with
red meat-ants tell him to pull his house, hut, tent
or whatever he lives in down and shift it away,
say, about a mile; the ants will follow. Then let
him shift the abode back to its original site.
Should the meat-muneliers return he should repeat
the first performance and so on until they get
sick of it. Let “DToo” not be deluded by other
Abo.-liars. Try my method first; it is the only
successful one.
“The Rumpus”: “Black Tracker” (B.
10/6/’26) need not have looked dubiously at the
silver coins offered him because 24 hours before
they had passed through the digestive organs of a
healthy emu. A sluice with cold water after their
ALWAYS BALM IN GILEAD.
“I wonder you ever married the 'ulking brute. You could 'are 'ad Joe.”
“Yes; but it ain’t so humilitating for a woman to be knocked about by a big man.”
re jection would cause silver or gold coins to become
as clean as on the ' day they were minted, the acid
secretions of the stomach removing every particle
of dirt clinging to the metal. I would sooner handle
minted money that had been temporarily “banked”
in an emu than most of the notes nowadays in
circulation.

“C. Coral”: Several new varieties of fisli
Rave lately appeared in Torres Strait and around
Thursday Island. One fearsome specimen hooked
recently carried a combination of horns circling
its head. Off Mabuiag some anglers captured a
couple of fish bearing a
resemblance to the sail-
fish, which is occasion-
ally seen in these waters,
but without the sword
that creature carries.
An unusual kind of
turtle was speared by
the boys on a lugger-
working near Anchor
Cay some little time
back; much heavier
and larger than the big-
headed turtle, this
specimen had no shell,
but carried instead a
series of ridges on a
ilark, greasy back. The
lads described it as
“half turtle half
dugong.” - Unfortu-
nately, its bulk pre-
vented it being hoisted
aboard, and after tow-
ing it some distance
they were, with the
approach of nightfall,
obliged to cast the
creature off. There are
some big turtle among
the Barrier reefs carry-
ing thick, heavy shell,
but this was not one
of them. The natives
are quite familiar with
the big turtle, although
they don’t go in for
capturing many of the
variety on account of
its power of opening
and clc ing the plates
of its armor, and
therewith trapping the
unwary. There are
stories current of one
lad who endeavored to
“make fast” to one he
had speared, but was
himself caught by the
hands and dragged
under, while another
was gripped by the
skin of the stomach as
he was getting on to
the big fellow's bac-k, and met the same fate.
* * * *
“J.D.C.” : I am not convinced that a fish
lias any feeling 1 (B. 17/6/'26). I was fishing m
Wallaroi Creek, near Condobolin, and a mate using
an exactly similar line and bait was on the other
side. He got- a bite and jerked out his line with
the hook gone. A few minutes later, my float went
down and I landed a cod about 51b. weight. While
extracting the hook, I noticed a piece of another
line in his mouth, and further investigation showed
a hook with a fresh yabbie tail attached, firmly
embedded in his throat. Line, hook and bait were
identical with my own and mate’s, so there was
no doubt the same fish took both baits. I have
more than once found young catfisli in a cod’s feed-
bag, through which the three big spines were pro-
jecting all round. For a fish to use its tummy for
a pin-cushion and still feed voraciously does not
argue pain. Fishing at Middle Harbor I once
landed a two-pound flathead so mutilated (appa-
rently by a shark) that there was scarcely enough of
it left to swim; still it grabbed my prawn and
fought gamely all the way to the surface. A
school of tailer in the bag of a net will some-
times tear lumps out of each other in the struggle
to get free, and yet seem to be quite unaffected
by the loss.
* * * *
“Spike”: The shingled lubras from Nor’-
Westralia (B. 3/6/’26) have compeers in a tribe
from the Ramu River, in the interior of the Mandated
Territory (N.G.). There the Marys’ locks are shorn,
•whilst the bucks proudly display flowing tresses
which reach below their waists. - Both male and
female plaster their hair with red ochre and ’possutu
fat until it is a gory, greasy mass. The people are
very primitive, having scarcely advanced beyond the
Stone Age. That they are gullible, too, is illustrated
on their bi-monthly visits to the beach, where they
buy seawater, for cooking- purposes, from enterprising
beach Kanakas.
* * * *
“Cartot”: In a town in tlio Northern
Rivers district of N. S. Wales lives a family the
seven sons of which are all over 6ft. in height,
several of them approaching 7ft. Both men and
women of the previous generation were also well
above the average, and it has been observed in
tlie district that tall people far outnumber short
ones. Some physiologists have suggested that tallness
and giantism are directly concerned with part
of the gland system of the human body, and
abnormalities in this system are due to such things
as the proportion of certain chemical elements in
diet. It is therefore possible that the North Coasters
in question are tall simply because of the locality in
which they live.. To a certain extent this is borne
out by the fact that the founders of the family
mentioned were persons of ordinary height. If such
a theory is established on fact, it ought to be possible
for stockowners to make use of it.
» * * *
“The Rumpus" : Abos. have more uses for
pigface-weed than curing jellyfish sting (B. 10/6/’26).
As a laxative it stands alone, and it is strange that
no patent-medicine concoctor has grasped the oppor-
tunity of putting it on the market. ' After the
yellow or pink flower dies, a withered-looking reddish-
brown nodule is left. The inside of this is
similar to that of a fig and contains about a
quarter of a teaspoonful of amber syrup, sweet to
the tongue. Binghi, junior, loves it, and while it
is to be procured no other opening medicine for
the child is necessary.
* * * *
“6 Wires”: How is this for the “long
arm”? Recently at Warialda (N.S.W.) there was
a land ballot for a Crown lease for which the Land
Board had allowed 511 applicants to have a marble
each. The winning marble w r as 350. All were returned
to the box and 31 added to make the number
512 for three homestead farms also to be drawn
for. After the marbles had been well mixed by
the clerk, the first block was drawn and the
number was again .350. The odds of 541 to one
were against this happening, yet it occurred.
* » * *
“Geoloin”: The boys stood disconsolately
at the street corner, being bankrupt alike, in pocket
and credit. The lights of the two pubs in the
little country settlement shone invitingly. In every
man there is a streak of genius. O’Grady’s came
to light. They went across to Mungovan’s pub, and
O'Grady, who has a way with the women, said to
the good-natured landlady: “There’s a raffle for a
pig at Duffy’s pub. Take a couple of chances,
Mrs. Mungovan. I’ll throw for you meself and don't
be surprised if I win the pig.” She gave him 2s.
and wished him luck. The boys then went to
Duffy’s pub, where O’Grady “filled ’em up,” and
then borrowed a bag from Duffy. Then he went
back to Mungovan’s, and in the back yard enticed
one of the good woman’s little pigs from its .sty
into the bag. Triumphantly he entered the bar.
“There now, didn’t I tell you I’d win him for you,
Missus.” said O’Grady. “Too right you did, Jack,”
said she, “put him in the sty, me good fellow, and
come back, and have a drink.”
* * * *
“Grossliead”: Re “fatigue” in steel (B.
17/6/’26). It is developed by all metals subjected
to variations, often repeated, in the stress applied.
The modern engineer is well equipped to allow and
provide for it. A familiar instance of fatigue occurs
in the axle journals of rolling-stock vehicles. These
after long use are apt to become brittle and break
off short. 1 have seen an Sin. diameter roll-shaft
snap like a. carrot for apparently no reason whatever,
though crystalline structure induced by “fatigue ’
proved to be the cause. In untempeved steel the
full strength may be restored by heating to a tem-
perature of 1100 degrees Fahr.; by this treatment
the metal resumes its normal structure. Hardened
steel will lose all its temper in the process of anneal
ing, but temper can be restored in the usual way.
The chain by which mine cages are attached to the
hauling ropes generally gets a dose of fire at regular
intervals to avoid risk of trouble.
* * * *
“Cuclmlaiu” : Complaints rend the air at
this time of year about the outrages committed
by the ’possum hunters. Miriam Vale, near Bunda-
berg (Q.), recently met with misfortune when
scalpers visited one of its paddocks at night with
their flashlights and other paraphernalia of war.
The 150 bullocks that were in the paddock took
fright and bolted up into the mountains. After
several days’ searching, during which some were
missed, it was discovered that about 20 had died
from eating poison peach and zamia. The Vic.
Fisheries and Game Department reckons that it
will have the tidy little sum of A 18,000 to its
credit when it has finished getting in royalties
on skins and license fees this season. The market
for ’possum-skins has ranged from 6s. to 300 s.
a dozen, and it is reckoned that at least 300,000
skins will be put on the market by the time the
season closes. The department gets a bob for
every skin sold, so it does pretty well out of the
dealer and trapper, the latter paying £1 for his
license and the- dealer £lO. Bunny is a lucrative
proposition, too, when the trapper or poisoner can
get Is. Id. each for his little pelt, as one at Glen
Elgin, near Glen Irmes (N.S.W.), did recently for
30-odd skins.
* * * *
“Lily”: Was this intelligence, or what?
The superintendent ancl the driver were seated in the
living-room of the ambulance station at Orange
(N.S.W.) when in came a red sheep-dog limping on
three feet. He stretched himself on the floor, and
held towards them an injured log. Upon inspection
they found it to be badly broken, and the injured
animal surrendered himself to their treatment. The
ambulance men had no trouble in setting the limb
and adjusting the splints. The break has knitted,
and the dog will soon be on all fours again.
BABRED.
FOREMAN: “Wot's up? the whistle's gone.
Ain't you goin' in to work?”
BRTCKY : “ Blime , I can't. They got hold of
me last night and put me on the water-
waggon.”
“Boobook* . Fifty years ago I, a very
small boy in Warwick. (Q.), firmly believed that
the adder had the words “If I could hear as well
as I can see, nobody would ever pass by me” faintly
outlined along its back ; so the occasional transition
from “death” to “deaf” isn’t so recent as “Colnb”
(B. 27/5/’2G) supposes.
THE CURLEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In front of the clouds hear the curlew complain,
“Rain! Rain!’’ '
And laugh, as the stormbird sweeps off with torn
feather,
In a ripple of syllables running together,
“Fine weather! fine weather! fine weather!”

When last week’s merry-go-round was
going its gayest, the State Exes, flung
still another ball into the field for the
delectation of the visiting polo players, their
wives, daughters and rich town cousins. State
Government House switched on all its elec-
trics plus a special line of illuminations on
the verandahs overlooking Port Jackson. By
nine o'clock the guests were streaming into
the reception-rooms, where Sir Dudley, very
decorated, handed them on to his lady, who,
a shimmer of emerald-green velvets with
an effective gold-leaf design, passed them on
to daughter Elaine, who was mostly smiles
above white beaded georgettes. Then diamonds
and pearls and ermine mingled in the crowds
like the sparkling crest of some sea of rain-
bow waters. Chiffons, velvets and beads
of every known color and lute eddied and
swirled about the rooms with dazzling effect.
Diamonds worth even a merchant-prince’s
ransom were worn by the Hordern lady, who
was furthermore enveloped in black velvets
and an ermine tippet of the highest distinc-
tion. A note must here be made that shawls
as a ballroom wrap are posse. Only ermine
and snowy Arctic fox protect the shoulder
blades of the very correct.
Pearls and a frock in which soft pink,
whose frothy flounce of black and white
lace just finished short of her ankles, were
notable features in the outfit of Mrs. W. 11.
Mackay. Mrs. Din Garvan’s sleek white
crepe breathed of a better land (or was it
merely Paris?), and georgettes of the rich
hue of burgundy were worn with great effect
by good-looking Mrs. Leo Watson, from Goul-
burn. Drought cannot wither nor polo func-
tions stale the infinite variety of the ward-
robe of Mrs. Fred McMasters. Dalkeith evi-
dently is a good pasturage; such exquisite-
ness must be backed by something almost as
solid as the gold reserves of Uncle Samuel.
Munros, Rosses, Mackays, Litchfields,
Osbornes and other sturdy sheepmen turned
up with every revolution of a jazz that all
through the night never romped into a beat
unsuitable for the decorous feet of vice-
royalty. For Sir Dudley and Lady de Chair
danced with as much zip as the two little
debs, in their pearl-inlaid georgettes. These
two were both bright-cheeked country girls
—Joan Badgery, of Scone, and Mavis Welsh,
of Orange.
The Polo Association not running a party
of its own this year, the Extra Chukka
Ball last Friday for the benefit of the
Country Women’s Association reaped a rich
harvest. Over 1200 turned out to this sec-
ond-last big flutter of the week of hard danc-
ing. to which the Rose Bay Golf Ball on
Saturday was the final and exclusive Amen!
The Chukka served its supper to an out-
burst of polo songs, the words of which
(from the pens of sheep-kings and such)
made you realise how close up “Bellerive”
is to the Poet Laureateship of a Continent.
However, who thinks of mere words when
the sentiment, the time and the drinks are
just right? As leader of the polo choir
Mrs. Jimmy Austin deserves a loud hand,
but probably she savored lier reward when
just before curtain-drop everybody, even the
vice-regals, hobnobbed with clasped hands in
Auld Lang Syne.
The State Exes, arrived about nine o’clock,
but Elaine was among the early-door rush
in company with General and Mrs. Herring.
This lady’s pale lilac chenillcd georgettes
flashed also among the reception committee
that stood to attention inside the Palais
doors for the entry of the Viking and his
lady. With her stood Mrs. Lugsdin and the
association’s president, Mrs. A. J. Studdy.
Captain Coot©, in attendance, wore a frozen
smile, which he afterwards thawed at the
little radiator like a coffee-mill which gleams
wickedly on the balustrade of each box.
There’s a suggestion of a crematorium, too,
about the grated squares let into the Palais
floor. Within these a blue flame leaps and
flickers —but perhaps it’s only for the com-
plete demolition of the dead marines. The
Sam Hordern girls were two of the evening’s
attractions, in their flower-garnished geor-
gettes warmed by white Arctic fox; and
Vera Coombe, in one of the new Beau Brum-
mel waistcoated tunics in rose and gold bro-
cades, caught the attention for half a minute.
As contourless as a blue pencil was Mrs.
Venour Nathan, in smart georgette ; and Mrs.
Albert Littlejohn, too, in jade and silver,
attained the slimness that passeth all under-
standing.
The Rose Bay Golf Club ran its own party
on Saturday night, and hither flocked such
a number of the Mr in brocade dinner-
jacket and waistcoat that at one moment it
looked as though they were lined up to do a
vaudeville act. This notion for evening-
wear has little but warmth to recommend it.
There was a terrific crush in the ballroom;
and even on the verandahs, where the bridge
hands segregated themselves, the area was
somewhat congested. The vice-regals were
not among the hundreds present, though
dozens who had been to the Backliaus Con-
cert shattered their dream of Chopin in the
midnight wail of the saxophone. Princess
Melikoff wore her weddiug garment of white
satin frosted over with diamente; and very
Burne-Jonesy looking Daisy Hay, shingled
and black georgetted, made one' of her infre-
quent appearances.
Both the Colin Stephens and the Sam
Horderns ran to a private dance during the
polo racket. The flutters were at the Rose
Bay Golf Club-house.
There was a sound of revelry by night and
Belgium’s consulate was gathered there, as,
in fact, were all the other consuls whose
countries send spokesmen to Geneva. And
the Palais Royal blinded its eyes while
ladies and gentlemen attired for a walk in
the Tyrol, on the dunes of Holland, or the
roads of Bruges and Brittany, tripped with
such colleens as only grow in Ireland, with
cavaliers of Greece, mandarins of China and
fascinating fragments of Turkish delight.
Beryl Mills headed Australia’s set, but its
girls were more like creatures in a heraldic
design (white and crimson robes and rising
suns clasping their brows) than followers
of the neeks-to-nothing garment that is the
national costume of the period. Poles, Rus-
sians and geishas from Japan were in the
melee, too, chaperoned by a lady named
Peace, who walked in the pageant amidst
a fluttering covey of child-doves. It was all
very pretty, this International Ball, and
quite as effective as the League of Geneva,
whose treasury it was to indirectly benefit.
The ball, which had been nurtured on
vice-regal smiles, drew the State Exes., who
brought in their train a great party of our
Very Best —a party that, after concert hours,
absorbed pianist Backhaus and his lady, and
the Gravestock couple. Lady de Chair's
raiment suggested a luscious golden plum,
and crescendoed to a tiara of many diamonds.
Green of the jade was daughter Elaine’s
choice. Princess-by-marriage Melikoff was
as glittersome with diamentes as a mountain
night with stars. Surgeon MacCormick’s
and Adrian Knox’s ladies supplied the grace
of soft black to the vivid colorings in the
group. Roseate laces snuggling under white
Arctic fox cheered Audrey Hordern through
the night, and Enid Falkiner showed the
sheen of ivory satin through the bead
embroideries of her frock. Sculptress Theo
Cowan and Harry Weston judged the sets
and individual costumes —Theo very effective
in taffetas like an opaline mist at morn
draped with an orchid shawl. She was
helped unofficially by General Lloyd on the
one hand and Mr. Hay on the other, both
complete with decorations. Her final deci-
sion in favor of the lady of Peace was
roundly applauded.
The next time you see a tensely-staring
group around a city accident, you can men-
tally follow
the ambulance
to Sydney
1 lospital; for
the Macquarie-
street life-
saver has a
greater casu-
alty list than
any other.
Follow the
accident to its
white - spread
bed, and you
get your con-
tact with the
lady in this
Ma y Moore
picture. She is
Mrs. Norman
Bladen, an d
her job in life
is to keep
every bed in
Sydney llos-
pital furnished with its full complement of
linen. She does this not .alone, but by the
grace and with the help of the busy hands
of the Hospital Auxiliary, of which she is
organising secretary. Over £2OOO a year is
spent on linen for the wards alone. If you
work that out at wholesale prices you’ll get
an idea of the number of sheets that grow
in the 12 months under the whir of the
machines at the Bligh-street headquarters.
During the war Mrs. Bladen was a sort of
offsider to Mrs. Mackinnon in Red Cross
activities, besides being secretary to the
Junior Red Cross. Apart from public duties
her chief vice is Dickens; and she is very
proud of being secretary of the Fellowship
that keeps the torch alight in Sydney.
There’s no entente either cordial or alco-
holic between the platinum-set yacht Sur-
prise and certain personages in high places.
The visiting millionaire Williams family
seemed to think before they left that all had
not been done in the matter of receiving
them that was their due. Ou the other hand
some people point out that it is no longer
necessary to serve even millionaires with
invitations on a golden platter or by special
messenger on a coal-black charger. One sec-
tion of debonair Sydney was lavishly enter-
tained at the nightly entertainments on the
ship; and the visitor who among the crowd
of revellers caught the eye of host or hostess
was later invited to family luncheon and
dinner parties at which absolutely nothing in
season was served. Alas the poor mine-
owner !
Here is a Bernice Agar picture of Mrs.
Herbert Marks, wife of the Macquarie-street
specialist. A
confirmed
dancer, she is
president o f
the ball for
Lewisham
Hospital
which will take
place at the
Palais next
Tuesday. But
her good-look-
in g husband
will not squire
her to the fri-
vol, which pro-
mises to be
one of those
u n m i tigated
successes, for
10,000-odd rea-
sons— all of
them miles of
water. He is
now in Eng-
land. But he has done so much for Lewis-
ham, and wants to do so much more, that
his wife’s work will certainly have at least
his moral support.
When Sydney’s one and only crematorium
was opened, one of its enthusiastic sup-
porters rather staggered his friends by mak-
ing it the occasion for a merry luncheon
party preceded or followed by a tour of
inspection. But in California (IJ.S.A.) the
crematorium is a favorite spot for brides and
bridegrooms to hark to the Voice that
Breathed. A letter from California tells
that in that sun-bathed State “there are
12 crematoriums, which are as beautiful
as the original Missions, with gardens and
cloistered walks; others have beautiful
chapels, flower surrounded. In our outdoor
climate we step right from the flower-gardens
into the chapel; in fact, one crematorium
chapel in a cemetery near Los Angeles,
which is patterned after the church at Stoke
Poges, had 40 weddings scheduled in it for
June. In this beautiful crematorium chapel
196 weddings were celebrated last year. One
pretty bride was asked why she chose it
for her nuptials, and she said that she knew
of no church in which funerals were not
held in addition to weddings, and this was
the loveliest little church she knew.”
Mrs. R. Bernard Job, wife of a well-
known Sydney masseur and a former student
of Julian Ashton’s, had the satisfaction,
before she left by the Esperance Bay for
Australia, of seeing her newest picture hung
on the line at the Spring Exhibition of the
Paris Salon. Before leaving for Europe
two and a half years ago, Mrs. Job found
ready buyers for her landscapes in oil
amongst visitors to the Society of Artists.
She returns apparently with a view to por-
traiture, for the picture in the Salon is the
study of a head. Agnes Goodsir (Mel-
bourne) and Annie Greene (Brisbane) are
other Australian artists who have been win-
ning Paris recognition.
The Ambassadors will be given over to
the Sydney Rowing Club next Friday for the
Club’s 18tli annual ball.
Well-known ex-Australian journalist
Frank Fox, one of England’s newest knights,
is bound by still another link to 'this conti-
nent. Plis only son, Frank Alison, married
Ellie Margaret Butler, of Woolwich, at All
Saints’, Hunter’s Hill, early last week.
Still another engagement in the Fell
family. Scott Fell’s eldest daughter, Linda,
has agreed to try the life-long contract with
Lieut.-Colonel Wheeler, of Newcastle, eldest
son of the H. L. Wheelers, of Randwick.
Dorothy Ward, of Rose Bay, has made a
date with Wynn Manchee, of Queensland, a
cousin of the Moree squatting family.
Baronet Richard Waldie-Griffith, then a
72-year-old widower, four years ago married
a Westralian lady. She. died the same year,
and he has now found a third wife in Malaya.
He had known the latest lady for only six
weeks when the wedding took place. The
cableman described the old boy as an Aus-
tralian, but it was a wrong guess.
A basement padlocked till the tocsin for
supper sounds. One-way traffic on the stairs.
A policeman at every window. No—the
Town Hall isn’t planning for a siege; only
for' the Artists’ Ball. These ordinances have
been issued by the committee which met to
arrange the Yesterday, To-day and To-
morrow Carnival that is to be held in the
joint names of Art and the Red Cross in
August. Sid Ure Smith is active on the art
side, and Mr. de Groot is inspirer-in-chief
of the Red Cross wing; and D. H. Souter is
unfolding a great scheme of decoration in
which rock carvings and abo. totems are the
chief ingredients.
The series of lectures on Australia by
patriotic Florence Fourdrinier ended last
week, the final lecture being given in the
Royal Colonial Institute. Many notables,
including vice-regals, dropped in to hear the
lady sing the praises of the Jewel of the
Southern Seas. The Australian poets and
composers, too, had their moment before
the footlights during the season.
Bertram Stevens's widow is now running
the Mascot, a well-lighted and airy sub-
terranean tea-haunt at 26 Hunter-street.
Already it is becoming a meeting-place for
the literary and the arty.
Australian dancer Ivy Shilling is one of
the latest settlers in Hollywood. She sand-
wiches that colorful colony between trips to
London and Paris. Ivy always has lots of
Australians at her parties; so do the Fred
Niblos —she, you remember, was Enid Ben-
nett. Another of Sydney’s old friends estab-
lished at Hollywood is Thelma Raye, who
once played with Vera Pearce in the Tivoli
Follies. Thelma, who was married while in
Australia to one of Stewart Dawson’s sons,
is now the wife of Ronald Column, the
newest star in the Hollywood firmament.
Miss Brisbane records a visitation:—
As soon as the Stonehavens had washed off the
dust of travel there was tea-drinking at Griffiths
House to meet the Country Women’s Association.
Gerberas and coral-pink tulle did up the cafe, where
tables were arranged in an M form. Mrs. Petersen
(president), Mrs. L, A. Childe, Kitty Hillooat. and
Adeline Powers gave the hand of welcome. There
was a big roll-up of members, Mrs. Lennon being
in the throng. The Lennons entertained the visitors
at lunch at Government House.
Bowls of wattle greeted Lady Stonehaven at the
Bush Book Club rooms, where she was met by Mi's.
Firmin McKinnon, who explained the work of the
club. Her Ex. promised to help. Pink and mauve
ribbons tied up the posy of gerberas she received.
The members of the Moreton Club lunched the lady.
There was a civic reception, too, in the Town Hall,
poinsettia and many flags taking part in the decora-
tions, and Emmie Stewart’s orchestra played. The
Mayor and Mayoress did the welcoming, Mrs. Jolly
presenting red and pink roses, sweet-peas and
violets all tied up with red and gold. Rose beige was
worn by Lady Stonehaven and old-rose banded her
hat. Mrs. Jolly was in a black satin coat over
navy satin. Mrs. T. J. Ryan was in black satin
with coney, and Mrs. J. W. Blair and Mrs. A. J.
Thynne in Ottoman silk in black.
There was a reception in the Brisbane Women’s
Club Rooms, in a wattle setting, with more red roses
for the vice-regal hand. Mabel Zillrnan and Doreen
Morgan and Barbara Sisley attended to the musical
and dramatic programme. Mrs. Wedd did the
welcoming.
A luncheon was arranged for the visitors at the
Y.W.C.A. rooms, where bowls of narcissi and wattle
bloomed sweetly. Mrs. Stewart greeted her Ex. on
behalf of the board. That evening the Governor-
General and his lady were dined at Government
House; the Chief Justice and Mrs. Jimmy Blair being
of the company.
Charming Maida Marlay, well known in theatrical
and musical circles here, has changed her name. The
bride wore ivory crepe romaine, a Brussels-lace veil
and orange blossoms framing her face, and white
roses, snowdrops and hyacinths composing her posy.
Hilda Hudson ’maided in painted chiffon in a design
of green and mauve. The National saw the feasting.
The man—if so small an accessory has to be men-
tioned—is John V. Stacey, of Brisbane.
The Geographical had a partly-mnsical party for
the visiting G.-G. after the annual meeting. Lady
Stonehaven had a black frock and cloak of black
and gold brocade, with coney cuffs and collar. The
Mayor and quite a lot of generals and colonels
were amongst the bidden.
Progressive mail jongg was played at Ada Bale's
party to Lorna Robprtson and Pearl Lahey, who are
soon to be married. The hostess wore navy with
black fur, Pearl Lahey was in Nile-green velvet,
Lorna Robertson in Oriental blue and red.
To help towards the new Children’s Hospital, which
the nuns will run in connection with the Mater
Misericordise, there was a ball in St. Andrew’s Hall,
South Brisbane, arranged by old pupils of All Hal-
lows. The pillars were swathed in greenery, and
baskets of roses hung from the ceiling. Pale blue
veiled the lights, and there was supper on the verandah.
Donald Harris, younger son of the E. B. Harrises
of Clayfield, took charge of Doris Briggs, daughter
of the late J. Briggs, of Hill End, in the Wharf-
street Kirk. Marguerites and roses and a wedding-
bell of sweet-pea dressed the tabernacle. The bride
was in ivory crepe romaine, and Evelyn Briggs
(pink) and Marjorie Connellan (blue) ' ’maided.
The reception was at the Bellevue.
Bpsh youngster has just covered himself with
glory. A primary correspondence (State) school was
started four years ago, and now 12 out of its candi-
dates have won State scholarships. Most of those
correspondence-school children had never been to a
school and never seen a teacher, yet their percentage
of successes far outclasses that of State- and private-
school candidates.

The “Vanishing Cream de luxe
Of all “vanishing ” creams Pomeroy Day Cream is the most
protective. When applied it vanishes instantly, but only to
become an invisible but none the less potent protector of
the youthfulness and charm of your complexion. And if
you " powder,” it holds the powder too.
d
sdf
Use Pomeroy Day Cream just before going out. Use it, as
the completing touch, just before the dance. Use it when
your face feels flushed. Use it whenever your skin feels
tired and needs toning up. Use it freely and you will
always look your best.

The sign “Silence please,” displayed in the
vestibule of the Auditorium on Saturday
night, showed that something unusual was
happening. It was Chaliapin’s first concert in
Australia, with jubilant people who had
tickets bumping despondent people who
couldn't buy standing room, even though part
of the platform was utilised. The pro-
grammes—regular volumes containing the
words of all the songs in the repertoire (with
translations) —sold at a shilling, and even
at that price the supply gave out, and the
sellers were almost mobbed.
Chaliapin proved to be extremely good
looking, very tall and of athletic build,
straight as the stem of a semiquaver, and
retaining, most wonderful of all, a waist, a
feature that distinguishes this big Russian
from all other famous bassos. After delight-
ing everybody by his good lmmor, his good
acting and his good voice, he beamingly
accepted a laurel wreath, transferred a leaf
to his buttonhole, and tucked another inside
his waistcoat. Violinist Hilda Sutton, of
Sydney, with red roses floating down cas-
cades of powder-blue tulle from a bodice of
the same shade of satin, was the envied of
all when, at the concert’s close, the great
Chaliapin led her and accompanist Max
Rabinowitsh forward to share the evening’s
honors.
Among the listeners were Mrs. Albert
.Miller, whose glistening coral-pink wrap
made a bright spot amid the fur-coated in
the stalls ; the Charles Taits, Phil Finkle-
stein and his pretty wife, she in a blue
brocade coat; Mrs. Jimmy Dyer and the
Holy City’s Conservatorium artists; Mar-
garet Chalmers, from Sydney; Mrs. Hugo
Wertheim. Professor Bernard Heinze, Mrs.
William Merry, Mrs. George Blackwood,
Nellie Yeitch and Mrs. Herbert Hewlett
and Mr. and Mrs. Littlejohn, of Scots’ Col-
lege. Madame Chaliapin, who sat with her
three daughters in the stalls, had a coat of
Russian sable over a gown of green satin
with a single pink rose “ embroidered on the
corsage.
Flemington was more cheerful on the
second day of the Grand National meeting
than it had been on the Saturday. It was
easier to pick winners, and though the lawns
still were damp there was a warm sun and
it was safe to leave wraps at home, though
lots did not. Plaids and check materials
and costumes with capes made up the eye-
catching features of the dressing. Popular
also was the tailored suit with trim double-
breasted coat and pleated skirt. The pass-
ing of the jumper seems to be at hand. In
millinery and frocks the shades of deep
petunia and bougainvillaea, which mere man
knows only as magenta, were much affected;
and green still found much support.
Dressing at the last day of the Grand
National meeting at Flemington on Satur-
day was positively without distinction. A
few more cape-gowns were seen; .but for
the most part only the usual winter apparel
was paraded, with most of the best furs left
at home. As on the first day, the fair sexshowed
devotion to the coat posy. Despite a crocked
knee, Baron Somers was in his place. Her Ex.
had red roses nestling amid the fitch fur of
her brown tweed coat, and a felt hat to
match the roses. Mrs. Davidson sported a
navy blue suit with cape effect, topped by
a clierry-red hat. Mrs. Phillip Russell, Mrs.
Jack McGomas (lately back from a holiday
in the East)-, wearing crimson embroidery
upon a navy jumper suit, and Jean Russell,
with a dash of bright pink cheering a black
frock and hat, were smart dressers.
Governor Somers limped along to the Vic-
toria League’s dance leaning on a stout-
stick, his lameness being the result of a
slight operation upon his knee. His Ex.
might justifiably have given the party a miss,
but the “England expects” flavor is- strong
about the new resident of Stonington. Most
of the decorations at St. Kilda Town Hall had
been seen before, but the array of big lan-
terns in their crimson-and-gold setting was
effective enough to be admired afresh. Lady
Somers, who took the floor in the merry fox-
trot with Prime Minister Bruce, was in black
with opalescent adornment and a pale pink
tulle scarf. Diamonds twinkled on rose
velvet around her fair shingle. The League’s
president, the Edward Miller lady, trailing
hyacinth satin after a georgette gown of the
same tone; Chief Justice Irvine and his lady,
she in dull blue and silver brocade ; the Prune
Minister and Mrs. Bruce, with cornflower-
blue georgette softening brocade, and knight
William Beath, ushered the viee-regal party
into the ball. Members of the committee
dived periodically into the maze of dancers
and came up with selected citizens who were
presented to the guests of honor. Rear-
Admiral Napier was near the throne with
his tall, slim, dark-haired wife, whose shaded
pink frock was lit up with crystal.
Sylvia Greene, in bronze lace with gold
bands, and the Irvines’ daughter Nance were
the hon. secs, of the occasion. A striking
bit of raiment was Mrs. Arnold Caddy's
sheath of lapis lazuli-hued sequins traced
with pink daisies, with softening of clouds
of georgette. Mrs. Hilary Reid was a com-
manding young matron in draped gown of
white satin scattered with a feathered design
in black beads and crystal. Lesley Merrick,
whose author-dad finds this city much to las
liking, wore silver-fox fur and gold embroi-
dery embellishing pink accordeon pleatings
of georgette. Feminine eyes rested very re-
flectively upon Mrs. Jim Bell’s attractive
frock of floral and black-striped silk much
gathered of skirt, and Lady Bastings caught
the gaze in silver and green lame.
“Abie’s Irish Rose” promises to be a good
lasting bloom. At the Princess Theatre on
Saturday “House full” was hoisted both after-
noon and evening, and the audience’s laughs
were loud and often. At night the boxes
were dolled up with pink roses and foliage
to mark the new Governor’s first appearance
in a Melbourne Theatre, and the usual little
tribute from the florist’s was handed to Lady
Somers, who covered an amber-toned frock
with a mink coat. Bride-elects in the audi-
ence found Rosie’s nuptials full of interest
and inspiration. Her gown of Early-Vic-
torian mode in white taffeta opening over a
petticoat of white Honiton lace, with a long
train inlet with the same, and a lovely lace
veil, will find lots of copyists. The six
bridesmaids, clothed in pink frocks and hats,
with wrigglings of white bordering their
skirts, and two wee ’maids, wearing white,
sedately carrying the train, gave the bride
her right setting. Rosie’s travelling dress,
too, an ensemble suit of grey cloth, satin
and silver-fox fur, with a strawberry-hued
headpiece, was worth conning. There were
pretty flowers a-plenty for the mummers, and
Hugh J. Ward had to make a speech. With
Lord and Lady Somers were Mrs. Davidson
and the Governor’s personal staff; General
Chauvel and his lady and Rear-Admiral and
Mrs. Napier were some of the folk who saw
the show from the boxes.
The decorations at St. Kilda Town Hall
for the borough’s annual ball suggested bush-
fire flames reflected on an Arctic pine-forest.
Mayor Cummings was host, and daughter
Alison, with a flickering of golden sequins
on her frock of dawn-pink, was the hostess,
her mother being on the other side of the
globe. -The newly-knighted Frank Clarke
brought his lady in a gown of delf blue and a
bit of ermine; Mrs. d. H- Hewison’s white
gown scintillated with crystal; ex-Speaker
Watt’s wife chose black georgette cheered
with embroidery of colored beads, and Mrs.
Fred Chamberlain (the town-clerk’s spouse)
had jet and silver upon her raiment of black.
The mayors and mayoresses of all the sur-
rounding suburbs made formal entrance, and
three charming girls in frocks of white and
silver broke into society.
One of the two Victorian women Who
caught the eye of the selectors for the birth-
day -honors
team is Mrs.

son, 0.8. E.,

b y Vandyck.
St. K i 1 d a
knows her best
—her late hus-
band was a
c o u ncillor—
but her char-
ity work is
w i d e spread.
She was presi-
dent of St.
Hilda’s It e d
Cross, and
organised the
district’s com-
forts fund in
1015. Also,
she is one of
the original
members of
(he Mayor’s Hospital Fund, and a vice-presi-
dent of the Queen Victoria Hospital. St.
Hilda’s Benevolent Society has her interest,
and also the Ministering Children’s League.
She has secretained many successful enter-
tainments and functions for philanthropic pur-
poses, a comparatively recent effort being a fete,
at Government House to help the Girl Guldesi,
The Melbourne Music Club, which is an-
other manifestation of the Albert-street Con.,
assembled its members on Saturday after
noon at the Lyceum Club to drink tea and
fraternise with visitors from the Adelaide Con.
Fritz Hart said the welcoming words, and
Professor Davies spoke up for Adelaide. Sec-
retary Muriel Campbell, Mrs. Gilfillan, Rita
Hope, Mrs. Dyer, Katie laddie and Mrs. E.
Reeves were noticed in the group round the
cheerful fire in the big reception-room,
Lilian Crisp sang songs by Holst, violinist
Gertrude Healy played a Delius Sonata, and
Mrs. Spry tendered some of Scriabin’s deli-
cacies by way of demonstrating our own
musical advancement. The University Con.
also stayed the visitors with greetings and
comforted them with tea, Professor Bernard
Heinze saying the words.
The Elder (Adelaide) Conservatorium
String Quartette, with pianist Maude Puddy
and baritone Clive Carey, supplied Melbourne
musicians with some mixed emotions when
they gave their first concert at the Assembly
Hall. It was a performance worthy of a bigger
audience. The chief feature was the Cesar
Franck Quintet in F Minor, in which the
bowed strings had splendid support from
Maude Puddy at the piano. In a Debussy
quintet there were some alluringly mystic
effects. Clive Carey, though his throat
troubled him, sang a cluster of French songs
charmingly.
Patrons of a classical dancing exhibition
by a pretty American at Scott’s Hotel re-
cently saw a
Bowles mask,
with which
the dancer was
so pleased that
she is taking
it back to
Chicago with
her to show
what Austra-
lia can do.
Though he
came from
Sydney, Wil-
li a m Leslie
Bowles fi rs t
studied art at
the Brisbane
Technical Col-
lege, there
gaining a
s c h o 1 arship
which took
him to Lon-
don. After
study at the schools, he put in some years’
work with Bertram Mackeunal as a studio
assistant. War service with the Imperial
Infantry in tank and despatch corps kept
him busy from 1914 to 1919. With sculptor
Wallace Andersoii he now models figures for
battle scenes at the War Museum, painter
Louis McCubbin supplying the landscape.
(Somebody suggests that a recent par. gave
the impression that McCubbin is in charge
of the Museum. He isn’t quite that, though
he is a valuable member of the staff.) Leslie
Bowles’s designs were given third place in
the Port Said monument competition, which
was won by his predecessor at the War
Museum, the late Web Gilbert. It is whis-
pered that the commission will now be
spirited to the Big Smoke, which isn’t play-
ing the game with our soldier-sculptors.
The Kendall String Quartette was unlucky
on Saturday night-—Chaliapin was sing-
ing just over the way; and only a few of
the many turned away at the Auditorium
thought of crossing the street to the Assem-
bly Hall to hear these talented women play
such four-part masterpieces as the Mozart
in D and Brahms in C Minor. The moderns
were represented by a quartette of Gerrard
Williams, the English composer.
A violent storm of confetti engineered by
Uni. students invaded Scots’ Church when
Mollie Forbes, 8.A., left a fern-covered
altar on the arm of Captain Barber, of
Toorak. The wedding-gown, of petal-pink
georgette, dripped with a silver rain of
gleaming embroideries —it was short and
sleeveless. A tulle veil of great length
trimmed at the border with hand-made
flowers formed the train; it was caught
back from the face with a diamond pin, and a
shower of pink roses was carried. The
attendants were Alison Armstrong and Jess
Blanche, in pretty sleeveless frocks of del-
phinium georgette charmante. Mrs. Lee
Steere, the bride’s mother, carried a
posy of scarlet carnations against a Frenchy
frock of black velvet nanne caught with dia-
mond buckles, and a black velvet hat en-
circled with plumage was pulled well over
her Titian hair. There were sounds of
revelry at No. 9 that night.
From Paris comes news of the marriage of
Mrs. Daisy Hunter, -widow of John, the Aus-
tralian boot king, to Carl Gernandt do.
Jossac, a Swedish baron, who writes books.
The Princess Dana Amilacliway attended the
bride, and a whole raft of titled foreigners
looked on, including the Minister for Persia,
Assad Khan, and his madame. The honey-
moon was spent motoring in France, and
the couple are now in Paris.
There is a ray of consolation for the cat
or the rabbit or whatever quadruped it is
that is slaughtered to trim the hoods of our
IJni.’s Bachelors of Arts. Some thoughful
investigator has found that the fur rots the
silk, and white silk is to be substituted.
A flutter of engagements has resulted from
the Air-Force dance. The latest is Flying-
ofticer E. E. L. Wilson’s to Isla Edwards
of Malvern.
Adeline Burke lias told from London ol
an engagement-ring, and the wedding is
fixed for September. The lucky young Eng-
lishman is Adrian Clarke, of the 6th
Di*agoon Guards.
Many will learn with regret of the death
in London of Mrs. John Reynolds Lewis.
There was family rejoicing lately over daugh-
ter Doris’s win of the Bossom travelling
scholarship in architecture. The Lewises
have been living in Fogland, at Belsize Park,
but their son Horton remains in Melbourne.
Ruby Angus is mourning the loss of her
mother. Mrs. William Angus, who died at
Wanganui (M.L.). The lady, formerly
Signorina Julia' Catherine, was an operatic
singer of high merit, whose greatest suc-
cesses w T ere achieved here with the Firm’s
first Italian opera co., under the direction
of Martin Simonsen. Of late years she has
been a Dominion resident, and only Ruby,
of the family of three daughters and a son,
came back to Australia.
An Australian in the Big Smoke, writing
of the Spring hats, says their only adorn-
ment is a fiat velvet ribbon bow; and naively
adds: “Only the Queen and very old ladies
are wearing feathers or flowers."
Wearing an early-Victorian frock of am-
ethyst chiffon velvet sprinkled with pink roses,
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer welcomed at Kinnoull last
week a crowd of guests bidden to meet Pro-
fessor Davies. director of the Adelaide Con-
servatorium, baritone Clive Carey, pianist
Maude Pudd.v and the members of tlic Elder
String Quartette. The Kendall Quartette
players and several well-known local instru-
mentalists and singers were on hand, and a
bevy of painters included Blamirc Young.
Kingsbury Baillieu, son of Arthur, who
died in April while only at the dawn of
manhood, left his young wife, (formerly
Grade Lavers, the actress) tolerably well
provided for—close on £19,000.
Certain of our nurses whose war services
have rendered them unable to hoe the hard
row of their former profession have turned
their talents to art needlework, knitting, the
making of jam and sweets and so forth. To
buy proper showcases in which to display
these goods, there is to be a bridge party at
Anzac House on Saturday afternoon.
Sister Adelaide shivers: —
Brnr! Frost thick on the grass o' mornings even in
Suburbia, and. in the ranges frozen water-troughs and
ponds and even frozen water in the radiators for those
rash enough to leave -their ears in the open for an
hour, or two at night. By day, cloudless skies and
flooding sunshine, to the no small amazement of the
English members of the Boueicault co. They find an
occasional game of tennis an excellent interlude in
incessant rehearsing, and consider us ungrateful cats
for mentioning that it’s a shade dry for the time o’
year.
Meanwhile our youngest set has found a new mode
of exercise, and goes treasure-hunting by night in
the approved London manner of two seasons past.
Four youthful bachelors were hosts at a party that
began with dancing at the North-terrace Palais
and ended with supper and more dancing at Glenelg,
with a treasure-hunting' detour round Suburbia on
the way.
Half a dozen S. Australians made their bow to
Throne and Person in London this week, among them
one of the MacMahon Glynn daughters, Mrs. Robert
Rymill, Winifred Nicholls and Evelyn Scarfe.
The Naldera’s passengers included the Way Camp-
bells, ' bound for London for the marriage of her son,
Dr Edwin Crazier, to Nancy, younger of the Glen
Legoe daughters.
Percy Grainger, who still proclaims this village
his home and favorite abiding-place, will stay with
his aunt, Mrs. George Aldridge, at Kingsmead, North
Adelaide, while he is here.
A. T. Saunders, the' Register’s prize correspon-
dent, with an uncanny instinct for digging up frag-
ments of ancient history, has unearthed a record of a
wife-sale at Hindmarsh in the not-so-long-ago. The
vendor was one Jarman and the purchaser Charles
Goble; the lady, a “smart and comely dame of flve-
and-twenty,” brought 27e. fid.
Clustering' lights shone through the blue and pink
and trailing greenery of the Osborne Hall’s decora-
tions on the night of the R. E. H. Hopes’ dance, with
more pink and blue in the cushions of deep-seated
chairs and a fragrant riot of sweet-peas on the supper-
tables. Mrs. Hope was all black and gold and her
daughter in elm-green. A pink ostrich-feather fan
struck a color note on (Ady Bridges’s frock of silver.
There was an eruption of dances on the same evening-
—the ’Varsity Dance offub, in the Elder Hall, where
tall hollyhocks lined the walls and banked the
stage, making a delightful decoration: an artillery
ball at Norwood; and another, under the wing of
10 youthful hostesses, at Covent Garden.
The Saint Saens C Minor Symphony was the star
item of the State Orchestra’s last concert, and
stands as one of its befit performances. For make-
weight there was music of Czech and Russian and
modern English, with Kenneth Duffleld’s “Ballet
Fantastique” to rouse local interest.
The Speck contimies to dissipate:—
A tidy little cheque fluttered into the St. Joseph’s
Convent Building Fund as the result of a big euchre
party and dance at the Continental last week. About
150 of those whose dancing days were over climbed
to an upper chamber for a quiet little game of
cards, while double that number—amongst whom
were his Ex. and daughter Margaret, attended by
gent.-help Captain Stopp—tripped merrily on the
pretty balcony pavilion.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Though lie broke no record, Clan Robert
gave? sterling exhibition-of jumping and stamina in
i e m, an “ . aticjnal Steeple at Ftemijngton on Satur-
day. The big Sir Robert—Kosmo gfelijing weakened in
the market after failing in the Steeplechasers’ Flat,
money coming in solid lumps for Blankwyn, Pericles
and Jupiter, but when thev stood fet the barrier Clan
Robert and Blankwyn were at 5 to 1, Pericles at
11 to 2, Jupiter 6 to 1, Namera 8 to 1, Agrieolo and
Epergne 10 to 1; the others (there were 13 starters)
were from 14 to 40 to 1. Blankwyn was in front
in the early stages, but Haoma led from the six
furlongs to the first fence in the “lane.” There
Clan Robert, who had been running second, took
charge and, jumping beautifully, he moved out of
the straight three lengths clear of Haoma, witli
Reparation, Yellow Mountain, Agrieolo and Epergne
in pursuit. Haoma nearly fell at the fence near
the mile post, and Clan Robert, turning for home
well ahead of the field, went on to win comfortably
by three lengths from Namera, who plugged on
gamely, with Epergne 10 lengths away third; Agri-
colo, who broke down, Jupiter and Minterne were
next. Pericles ran badly and Blankwyn was the
only horse to fall. Moon rode a confident race on
Clan Robert, who competed at Randwick in J. J.
Garvan’s colors and was sold by him to Norman
Ealkiner. McCalman produced the sturdy fellow in
fine fettle—he had to be in excellent shape to carry
list. 81b. over 25 furlongs of Flemington timber in
6min. 13lsec.
Scourie (7 to 1), who was a high-priced yearling,
was much too good for the opposition in the Doutta
Galla Hurdle, and Red Mac (7 to 1) downed Talpha
(7 to 4) in the Footscray Steeple after Talnha
had been 20 lengths in the lead. David Garrick
(7 to 1), with Duncan aboard, closed the meeting
by taking the July Handicap, one mile, with Oura-
gan and Who’s Mistake next best. Tile party bemnd
The Banker backed him enthusiastically for this
race, but the ex-Maorilander didn’t show up.
"The Accountant": I fancied Seventh
Heaven for the two-year-old race at Flemington on
Wednesday week. It' was my boy’s seventh birthday,
also the seventh day of the seventh month; and when
1 found the filly had drawn No. 7 marble I rushed in
with my head down and put seven bob on. She ran
seventh. Do you pay 7s. for a seven-line par?
Backing favorites, a silly
game anywhere, is sheer idiocy in
Sydney. There were 15 races alto-
gether at the postponed Rosehill
meeting on Friday" and at Moore-
field the following day, and not one
favorite’s number was hoisted first.
The shortest-priced winner—Whizbro
in the 10-furlong handicap at
Moorefield—was at 9 to 2 ; four went
out at 8 to 1, four more at 12 to
1, one at 14 and another at 20
to 1. Clumsy and Nancy Alwyne,
who had run nowhere at Rosehill,
were among the Moorefield winners,
and insiders profited by Clumsy’s
victory—he firmed from tens to
sijfes. On the other hand. Green-
dale (8 to 1), conqueror of a rather
detent field on Friday, ran last on
Saturday, the distance and the
jockey being the same and the
company decidedly' inferior. Such
are the joys of suburban racing in
Sydney. Old Beauford was backed
for the seven-furlong handicap at
Rosehill, but" faded out in the
straight, the places being filled by
sturdy little Don Moon (12 to 1),
Mingelo and Bagpipes. The last-
named, a four-year-old chestnut
gelding by Polyphonic—Corrie In-
villie, with speed in every line,
came with a great run from the
rear of the field, and McShortodds
immediately applied the woolpress
to his price for the Epsom Handicap,
in which he has 7st. 101 b. The
interesting customer was imported
by the man who owned Claro and
is in the same Randwiek stable.
“Key”: Last Friday morning a
Sydney telegraphist whose mind was
on the Rosehill races got a message
which read: “Be on Green to-day;
don’t miss.” Was it Greendale or
Greenhorn ? The wire, as received,
gave no clue. There was no time
to be lost, so he rushed out and
put TOs. on each neddy—they were
in successive races—at s.p. When
both had duly arrived at eights, he
thought he would let the suburban
operator know of his good luck, “Won
eight quid at Rosehill,” he began.
“Good iron!” came the tapped
reply ; “but wait till I tell you
about that wire this morning—l
forgot to mention it before. It was
about an appointment on a bowling: -
green.”

The annual polo tourney for
the Dudley Cup reached a
generally expected conclusion at
Kensington (N.S.W.) when Harden defeated Muswell-
brook by 8 goals to 4. Currandooley lifted the
Garvan trophy by vanquishing Goulburn Squares.
4 to 3. Harden, which also won last year, was
-by far the best combined side in the tournament,
and was splendidly mounted.
If a country greyhound has the speed, his
condition can generally be depended on. This was
evidenced at Rooty Hill (N.S.W.) last week w T hen
Smiling Chief (Grenfell) and Phantom (Mudgee)
carved their respective ways to the final of the
Dewar Cup. It then took two courses to separate
the pair from the wheat belt. There was a great
yell as Smiling Chief showed the way to the hare,
but the close-working Phantom leapt in and evened
the points with an electric kill. The run-off
produced another desperate battle; the pair were
fit to run all day. Again the Smiler led, and this
time he raised the flag.

For two rounds of the Saturday-uight
scrap at the Sydney Stadium, Tom Uren gave
“Sunny” Jim Williams a lesson in the niceties of
the noble art. Then James made up his mind that
trying to box the old master was no game for him,
and when the bell rang for the third stanza he
rushed in and slammed away in the Rafferty fashion.
He had been sneaking in illegal punches to the back
of the neck earlier; now he simply defied the
referee and the ghost of “Old Q.” Uren was
banged to the canvas. Up at once, he tried to
keep away and box, but heavy swings to the head
and body put him down for the count just before
the end of the round. The coon is a dangerous
rough-house fighter, but a stricter referee would have
disqualified him for using the “rabbiter.” Weights,
Williams list. 431 b., Uren list. 2ilb.
Judging by Billy Edwards’s showing against
Victorian Alt Stewart at Newcastle, that 19-year-old
Cornstalk will avenge the defeats of Collins and
Uren if he is matched as judiciously as a shrewd
trainer “places” a promising young neddy. Stewart,
an ex-middleweight champion of Australia, 'was
settled in six rounds; he lasted a good deal longer
against Williams and Payne. Tom Maguire, the
hefty youth’s handler, wants to match him against
Collins, who still holds the Australian belt, and
has put up £lOO as evidence of good faith.
* * * *
There is always action when Billy Meeske
is on the mat, and William excelled himself at the
Melbourne Stadium on Saturday, in the sixth round
of a “wrestling” match with Clarence Weber for
the heavyweight championship, he knocked his erst-
while teacher cold with a right to the point. The
punch was perfectly timed and executed, and Billy
and his band were indignant when the dead-to-the-
vvorld Clarence was declared winner on a foul. Weber
had gained a fall one minute from the start with an
old-fashioned cradle hold. Meeske made it level
pegging with a head lock and body press in round
four, and seemed to have the tiring Clarry ripe for
another fall when he expedited the business with
a clenched fist. Weber, list. 71b., was a stone
heavier than the knock-out virtuoso.

After having mopped up Notts by an
innings and 136 runs, the Australians scored their
third successive victory in a two-days’ match against
Worcestershire, where the bowlers on both sides shone
more than the batsmen. Our men opened none too
impressively with a first innings of 197 (Bardsley 35,
Ponsford 33, Oldfield 32, Gregory 30). Root took
4 wickets for 61, and Bowles 3 for 42. The county’s
start was far worse, the first four men being dismissed,
all by Macartney, for 8 runs, but M. It. Foster (62 )
and Ashton (25) mended the situation somewhat, and
the innings closed for 120, leaving Macartney with
the excellent analysis of 5 for 38 and Grimmett with
the amazing one of 4 for 3. Bardsley declared Aus-
PICKIN’ ’EM.
MRS. PUNTER : “You’d be m ich better off if you kept
your money in your pocket. You’ve got horses
on the brain.”
PUNTER: “Gripes, I even picked a ang t’ live with!”
tralia’s second innings closed when 4 wickets had
fallen for 182, his own contribution being 55; Rich-
ardson and Ponsford, the not-out men, had 51 and 30
to their names. Root bowled only four overs ; pre-
sumably the idea was to keep him fresh for the Test
match, in which, however, he was not destined to
figure. The county was left 259 behind, and Grim-
mett. and Maile.v rattled it out for 83. the former
claiming 4 for 31 and the latter 4 for 20.
The unhappiest cricketer in England after the first
day of the third Test match may well have been Carr,
the home captain,; the one most to be envied Macart-
ney, whose praises were being chanted' from John o’
Groats to Land’s End. In putting his opponents in
after winning the toss Carr is presumed to have acted
on the advice of the selectors and the seasoned players
of the side as well as his own judgment, but what is
utterly inexplicable at this distance, and apparentlv
at any, is the dropping of Root and Parker if the
wicket looked at all like favoring the bowlers. The
former has bothered the Australians more than any
•other man they have faced during the tour, and the
latter is the deadliest bowler in England, bar none,
upon a tricky or uncertain pitch. The selectors, how-
ever, preferred Macaulay and Geary, each of whom
was pasted all over the field. Yet the hazardous
policy of giving a strong batting side first strike
seemed as if it were going to be justified—for about
two minutes. Bardsley was taken by Sutcliffe at first
slip off the first ball bowled ; Macartney was missed
by Carr at third slip off Tate’s fifth ball. Others may
share the responsibility with the English captain for
what proved a deplorable blunder in strategy, but
the missed catch —and Carr is generally a safe field
—upset England’s apple-cart with a crash. For
Macartney went on to make the English bowling look
cheaper at Leeds than any English batsman had made
the Australian bowling look at Lords a fortnight
before.
English writers and those who saw Macartney’s
great display are still dredging the dictionary for
glowing superlatives. He scored his century before
lunch and his 151 in 169 minutes. It was, if not
the innings of a lifetime, pretty near to such, con-
sidering- all that hung on it, and the crisis at which
it was made, and the team’s ill luck in barely having
a dozen players fit to take the field. In addition, for
easy confidence, sparkling resource, vigorous hitting
and adroit placing it was, after the initial let-off,
Macartney at his best, and Macartney at his best has
had no superior in Australia but Trumper. It was the
highest individual score in a Test on the Leeds
ground, beating F. S. Jackson’s 144 n.o. in 1905, and
the second-wicket partnership (235) is a record for
any Test. But if Macartney stands in the centre of
the limelight, Woodfull and Richardson, the other
century-makers—their contributions were 141 and 100
—helped the veteran worthily to make cricket history
and enhance their own reputations. The former, who
played as steadily as a rock, is only beginning what
promises to be a brilliant career; and Richardson’s
solidity and reliability show that he should have
been one of the first men picked instead of one of the
last. Gregory (26) and Ryder (42) gave some assist-
ance towards the close, so that the total reached
494, but in the main it was three men who put
Australia on top at Leeds. Tate bowled best with
4 for 99. How many headaches are the English selec-
tors going to have before the attack is chosen for the
fourth Test?
• • • • • •
With Australia’s weakened side and little to be
feared from Gregory with the ball, it was still in
the power of England to tackle a big task with
sturdy confidence. Hobbs and Sutcliffe have faced
odds as great in Australia with coolness and imper-
turbability, but the home team was clearly a bit
shaken this time, and there was no repetition of the
display at Lords. The famous opening partnership
realised only 59 and the slowness of the cricket sug-
gests that backswere to the wall early. Sutcliffe
returned one to Grimmett when he had made 26;
Woolley (27) helped Hobbs (49) to add 45 for the
second wicket, but after that misfortunes came fast.
Mailey got Hendren caught for a duck, and Macartney
dismissed the two hitters, Carr and Chapman, cheaply.
Kilner (36) did a little to stem the collapse, but
8 wickets were down for 203 on Monday night, Eng-
land being left with nothing to fight for but a draw.

The Rugby Union came back to its king-
dom in Sydney on Saturday, when close on 40,000
people saw' N. S. Wales defeat the mighty All
Blacks by 26 points to 20—four tries, two goals
and three penalty goals to four tries, a goal and
two penalty goals. It was a magnificent game to
watch, and though both sides were without some of
their star men, the form shown was of very high
quality. The home team had all the best of it in
the back division and, Blackwood having early
established his superiority in hooking, was given
plenty of chances to attack. Sheehan -was at hLs top
at fiie-eighth, and with Towers and King, the centres,
living up to the importance of their first big game,
the back division swung into action with delightful
ease time after time. Crossman and Bowers, the
former particularly, proved effective wingers. Ross,
at full-back, played one of the most remarkable
games ever seen in this series, and must be ranked
in the championship class. The Blue forwards,
outweighted and over-reached, were a trifle inferior
in the line-out work, but in pack and loose were
tigers for work. They did not repeat their old
mistake of picking up in the loose, but kept the
ball at foot and reaped the benefit. Their tackling
was deadly, and the way the tired pack stood up
to the storm tactics of the giant Maoriland forwards
in the closing stages, and then counter-attacked, had
the great crowd on its toes.
The All Blacks were still feeling their sea trip,
but on the day w T ere slower all round, while their
reorganised backs took some time to shake together.
Dailey, at half, did great work, as also did Mark
Nicholls and Cooke behind him. Elvy, on the left
wing, has improved a lot since his last visit, and
may now be counted a top-notcher, even for Maori-
land. Brown, at full-back, was eclipsed by Ross.
The forwards were dangerous throughout; their
final attack on the N.S.W. line, led by Finlayson,
Brownlie and Irvine, in a desperate attempt to
retrieve the day, was a sight to be remembered.
It is more than likely that they will reverse the
verdict in the remaining games, -when they have
fairly found their land legs, but some great foot-
ball should be witnessed. The pity of it is that
encounters which are making football history should
have to be played on the second-rate Agricultural
Ground while the Cricket Ground is given over to the
relatively unimportant (lub games of the Northern
Union crowd.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Rugby League team in Bris-
bane was again badly beaten by Queensland on
Saturday, the Northerners showing great combination,
and winning by 37 points to 19. { The N.S.W. back
division, strengthened by O’Rourke, the University
centre, made a better showing than in the first
match, but the Queensland forwards were the domi-
nating factor; they fairly overran the opposition
in the second half. This victory gave Bananaland
the rubber. How r it came to lose those two games
in Sydney remains a mystery.
* * * #
The 22,800 Melbourne persons who pushed
into Victoria Park on Saturday—incidentally leaving
£658 in the turnstiles- —saw the fast, systematic Colling-
w'ood Magpies at their best, while the Richmond
Tigers, bogging in casually, fell ever further in
arrears. Richmond finished with 5 goals 11 behinds
to ’Wood’s 14 goals 15 behinds; Gordon Coventry
booted eight of the 14 goals and brought his tally
for the season up to 51. Another big crowd visited
South Melbourne to see if Geelong could break its
long sequence of defeats—it hasn’t won on that
ground since 1905. Owing to a trumpery dispute
ages ago the Hubbites would dearly love to wallop
South on its own ground, but the Red-and-whites
are equally determined that the feat shan’t be coin-
passed ; and once more, after a most strenuous sc uffie,
Geelong w'ent home without the bacon —-South 67
points; Geelong 56. Carlton managed, with luck, to
down St. Kilda by 80 points to 63; and Melbourne
accounted for ’Roy by 99 points to 60. Essendon,
though playing scraggily, had small trouble in
collecting 74 points to Hawthorn’s 47 ; and the old
Association rivals, Footscray and North Melbourne,
indulged in a willing go, ’Scray getting 93 points
to North’s 68.
NO SPECIFIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Scores of cricket writers advocate the removal
of the time limit for Test matches in England as the
only way of ensuring finality.”
1 fell asleep, and in my dreams I scooted through
the years;
Some twenty that are now ahead toau run their
wild careers,
And then I met a cricket fan whose eyes were
streaming tears.
1 smote the mourner on the back. “Heart up, my
friend,” I said,
“And gather roses while you may, or cakes and ale
instead.
You’ve but a span to live, whereas for scons you’ll
be dead.”
He strove to choke his sobbing- down and tell his
dismal tale.
At cricket and whate’er pertains thereto he was a
whale,
And daily churned his copy out by columns for
the Mail.
“For years,” he said, “we begged and urged the
stubborn M.C.C.
To take the time lid off the Tests and have finality.
Hut ’twas a weary time before we got them to
agree.
W hat sportsman grudges days or weeks expended
on a Test ?
No use to play the game at all, it can’t be over*
stress’d,
Except it settles once for all which of the sides
is best.
“The Gov’ment took it up at last and made a
slogan bright
Of ‘Played-out Tests’ to bracket with ‘Australia
for the White’;
And, lest the painter might be cut, England gave up
the fight.”
“Then why this grief?” I shot at him, “when we
can certain make
Of getting definite results whene’er the field -we take
Across the sea?” He wept anew as if his heart
would break.
“This year we met the foe betimes. We played two
games in May.
They took so long that lesser teams there was no
time to play ;
The first one in our favor went, the next the other
way.
“We met again and locked our horns for three full
weeks in June ;
Through rain and shine, through misty morn and
sunny afternoon,
And England didn’t score a win till every stump
was strewn.
“Level once more our champions drew in genial
July;
Whole stacks of centuries were made, the month
being fairly dry.
’Twas now a ease of two-and-two and also do-or-die.
“When August came we won the toss and waded in
to score
On Oval turf where Cockney crowds tumultuously
roar;
Our total when the innings closed was fifteen-seventy-
four.
“But England in the second week played up deter-
minedly
And finished none so far behind with fourteen-eighty-
three.
The world hung breathless on the wires. Who could
the end foresee?
Again our men the creases took to block and cut
and drive;
But, spite of sitting on the sptce, the best we could
contrive
Was to record upon the board a thousand runs and
five.
And now, alas! which side is best there is no way
to fix,
for when old England’s whipper-in was snapped
behind the sticks
Their tally—see what it i Qvolves—- was just ten-
ninety-six.
Finality is still denied. A tie—O cruel stroke! —
Is inconclusive as a draw,” be wailed, this sporting
bloke,
“And how avert the chance of it?” I heard as I
awoke.

“Richmond" : On July 9 the Richmond
River (N.S.W.) Herald had its 40th
birthday. It had a hard uphill fight,
in the days of sugar-cane, floods and
bank crises, but with the advent of
the dairying industry it soon forged ahead.
The founder, proprietor and first editor —L.
F. Benaud, is still on deck, but he has re-
tired from active work. His son William
carries on the business. 11. A. McCallum
has for many years been the editor. The
older Benaud was Mayor of Coraki for many
years, and relinquished the chair only last
year, but he is still a member of the Rich-
mond River iCounty Council.
“P.X.”: Jimmy Ryan, M.L.C., who after
85 years of owner-editorship has handed
over the Lithgow (N.S.W.) Mercury to a new
co., Western Newspapers, Ltd., was chosen
as the representative of the country journals
of Australia on the so-called delegation that
was invited to Europe by the British Gov-
ernment when things were looking pretty
bad early in 1918. But he wasn’t able to
accept the invitation, and Major Whitehead,
a Victorian, went instead. Willie Holman
chose him for another job—the downing of
present Speaker Dooley in Lithgow. If
Ryan couldn’t do it Holman reckoned no-
body could; and Ryan couldn’t.
“The Deacon” : Only one serious attempt
was ever made to supply any opposition to
the Lithgow Mercury, which has just been
absorbed with the Bathurst Times in West-
ern Papers, Ltd. About a dozen years ago
a number of patriots decided to bring out
a true-blue Labor paper every Saturday.
The old Methodist church was hired, and
the Dogood printing plant placed therein.
The name of the fledgling was the Demo-
crat, and for a while it made a brave show.
But the apathy of 12,000 wageplugs in the
town settled its chances after a few pre-
carious weeks. It was a penny cheaper than
the Mercury, too, but to miners making £ll
or more a week that was a mere detail.
“Spare Sub.” : The Queensland branch of
the A.J.A. is starting an offensive against
the outsider in journalism, “with particular
reference to sporting engagements” ; and the
parsimonious practice is just as prevalent
down south. Civil servants, with free Satur-
day afternoons, are the most inveterate
poachers on the preserves of the professional
writers; they are usually content to get a
free pass and 7s. 6d. for recording an after-
noon’s play. “Expert” knowledge is some-
times pleaded, but in 95 per cent, of cases
this is mere bluff. The Queensland ama-
teurs have been listed, and include civil ser-
vants, bank clerks, lawyers and various,
every darned one of them in a week-day job
of his own. The Government will be asked
to put the screw on civil servants, while
the unions, if any, to which the others be-
long will also be talked to.
“Kookaroo”: Met Staff-Sergeant Harry
P. Evans the other day testing soil for alka-
linity on the Northern Tableland (N.S.W.).
It was he who built up the printing section
on- the Western Front, under Col. IV. H.
Tunbridge, of the Motor Transport, from
second-hand and shell-shocked machinery
salved from Ypres, Albert, Annentieres and
Dunkirk. He was not a printer by trade,
and his first assistant was Corporal Stan
Randall, a farmer. The plant first con-
sisted of a small platen machine, on which
was printed llonk, the organ of the Motor
Transport—“ Benzine Lancers,” they faceti-
ously termed themselves—edited by Corporal
(subsequently Lieut.) Phil Harris, who later
edited Aussie. The plant was eventually
made a war establishment, with Evans in
charge of a staff of 12, and printed Corps
Orders, etc. In addition Evans edited, set
I lie type, made the first stereo ever cast in
the field and machined a little paper (eight
pqges), Kookaburra. The section printed
the Rising Sun, edited by Captain C. E. IV.
Bean, arid 60,000 copies of the first issue
of Aussie, another record. The first three-
color work ever printed in the field was from
a painting of Pozieres by Second-Corporal
J S. Butler (“Pip”), of the printing staff.
“Selinorrer” : The demise of the Jewish
Herald is a reminder that the Chosen have
helped to fill the newspaper cemetery with
graves. The first Hebrew journal in Aus-
tralia, the Voice of Jacob, was published in
Sydney in Alay, 1842.. It reported that 856
Jews were then in .Australia —559 of them
in the County of Cumberland and 59 in Port
Phillip. The Voice v;as' only upraised thrice.
The Australasian Jewish Chronicle
came to light in Melbourne in 1861; this also
died in infancy. The Australasian Israel-
ite, started in Melbourne in 1871 fey .Solomon
Joseph (afterwards editor and proprietor
of tli'e. TamwQrth News), lived into its
fourth • year ; the Dialectic, in Melbourne,
ran fo'r seven, .issues ; ■ and then Jewry was
without a voice until the just-expired Jewish
Herald arrived a few,years later. In Syd-
ney the Australian Hebrew Times
arrived in 1894 and departed after a 12-
months’ struggle. The Australasian
Hebrew came out in Parramatta towards the
end of- 1895.. After a year Dan Levy (the
Parliamentarian) became editor, but tin-
paper lived barely 18 months. The Hebrew
Standard, still existent, dates from 1895;
the Australian Jewish Chronicle, started
in 1922, a strong pillar of orthodoxy,
nationalism and Zionism, is the latest addi-
tion to the list.

♦
Granted that Chaliapin is the greatest
bass at present hounding down the echoes
of the globe. Granted with this vocal superi-
ority he combines a dramatic talent that
would make him, if he mislaid his voice, one
of the world’s most famous exponents of
characters as wide apart as L’Aiglon and
Mark Antony. Granted all these things,
there remains the fact that an entertain-
ment like his first concert in Melbourne
leaves a slight vacuum in the appreciation,
even if it leaves no emptiness in the air.
For here is a man, renowned for his inter-
pretations of sundry tragic roles, obliged
to perform them clad in the costume Rotari-
ans assume when they tell each other about
international brotherliness; here is a bril-
liant actor obliged to say his part With one
hand on the grand piano, and against a back-
cloth composed of ordinary folks packed by a
thrifty management behind the bare prosce-
nium. The effect is somewhat disconcert-
ing. A soprano or a tenor may be enjoyed
with eyes shut for the pure melody of the
notes. A bass —even the world’s greatest
bass—is subject to certain limitations, and
Chaliapin almost talks some of his most
telling lines. He assists his voice with some
fetching gestures of hand and feature, and
when he conjures up the vision of a
beauteous female, and prints a hot vocal
kiss upon her lips, it is disturbing to see half
a hundred faces (at ss. 6d. plus tax a face)
staring through your vision of the lady’s
enchanting form.
* * * *
The above impressions having been regis-
tered, it remains to say that the elderly ex-
member of the Volga Seamen’s Union is a
supreme master of his craft who did succeed,
again and again, on Saturday night in mak-
ing the largest crowd ever compressed into
the Auditorium forget the disabilities his art
labored under. When he detailed the inven-
tory of Don Juan’s amorous conquests (Moz-
art) in France, Italy, Germany and Spain,
one was prepared to accept the figure (2363)
as approximately correct. When he sang of
“ ABIE'S TRISH ROSE,” AT MEL-
BOURNE PRINCESS.
Pat Murphy (John McCabe ) learns that
Solomon Levy (Jack Trainer) is his
daughter's pa-in-law.
the Government clerk (Dargomijsky) who
proposed to a general's daughter and, when
she turned him down, got gloriously tight,
he recreated for everybody the Universal
Male at holts with the Universal Tart. When
he discoursed of the flea (Moussorgsky)
whom the king cherished as his son, bestow-
ing on it a diamond star and orders on all
its poor relations, until the whole Court
began to itch, the audience scratched sym-
pathetically. And when he sang the hack
neyed Volga Boat Song, it brought back to
this listener, for the first time, memory of
Samara bridge and timber-rafts with apri-
cot and blue villages on them and red-shirted
men and kerchiefed women heaving on the
same pole, to the rhythm of a heart-breaking
melancholy chanty. Tuesday's was another
Russianly fascinating show, and there will
be more to-night, Saturday and Tuesday.
Max Rabinowitsh, Chaliapin’s own accom-
panist, and Hilda Sutton, a dainty Austra-
lian with an expressive violin, help the big
voice through the evening.
The most disquieting feature of “Abie’s
Irish Rose,” released on Saturday at Mel-
bourne Princess, was Abie’s Irish nose.
According to this Showman’s reading of the
text, the organ should resemble the prow of
Cleopatra’s galley. Instead, it was an unob-
strusive which sued grave doubts upon
the claim of Solomon Levy to be the young
man’s father, and upset the otherwise admir-
able casting of the play. The piece, despite
—or in explanation of —the fact that it has
run for five years in NWork and will doubt-
less run for ever, reveals itself as a by no
means exceptional farce-comedy strung on
the sectarian theme, which gives an oppor-
tunity for the gallery to pour down cascades
of applause on the verbal exchanges of a
rabbi and a Roman Catholic priest, in the
Allan Doone manner, on the subject of
religious tolerance. The son of a Hebrew
clothes-dealer brings home an Irish colleen,
to whom he has already been secretly com-
bined by a Methodist parson. His orthodox
parent is very easily persuaded to accept
Rose-Marie Murphy as Rosie Murfiski,
daughter of another wealthy member of the
tribe of Judah, and fresh nuptials according
to the proper are proceeded with.
Accompanied by the priest, Patrick Murphy,
father to the girl, arrives after the Hebrew
ceremony is over, and the two fathers repro-
duce the atmosphere of religious tolerance
and racial goodwill that preceded the last
N. S. Wales elections. While they are at
it, the priest, in collusion with the rabbi,
unites the couple, for the third time, accord-
ing to the rites of Rome. A year later the
disowned pair are disclosed, in humble but
clean apartments, busy with the inevitable
baby, and over the innocent creature the two
fathers forget their differences. There is
only one fly in the unguent. The Irishman
wanted a grand-daughter, the Jew a grand-
son ; nature obliges by providing twins, of
different genders.
* * * #
As has been said before, with the exception
of Abe the casting is just and proper. Abe
( George Duryea), in the interests of dramatic
verisimilitude, should forthwith slap a lump
of glowax on his nasal organ and defy the
matinee idol-loving populace. Jack Trainer
supplies an excellent engraving of the Jewish
father who substitutes oranges for orange-
blossoms in the wedding decorations because
the fruit can be eaten afterwards. John
McCabe is very thankfully not a low-comedy
Hibernian. Henry Mortimer is a stately
rabbi in a frock-coat who would be equally at
home in the robes of prophecy; and David
Wall is a sympathetic priest. Grace Staf-
ford is an Irish girl of pleasing mien and
slight histrionic attainments. Marty Ford,
in a hat too large for him, is very busy being
an unsuccessful farce-merchant; and Bertha
Walden, in a drayload of General Monash’s
briquettes, is a merely-sartorial jest. The
scenery is torn between a stern desire to be
realistic and the necessity of making the
playgoer feel that he is getting his full
money’s worth.
❖ * * *
“Princess Ida” is to be the final offering
of the G. and S. season at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne. She will commence to on
Saturday. The craze for culling musical-
comedy titles from the agony column of the
Argus is growing, and “Leave It to Jane”
will leave the Theatre Royal to “Tell Me
More” on the same date. “The Best People,”
at the Athenaeum, remains a monument to
the business acumen of E. J. Carroll and
the urbane publicity methods of Frank Tal-
bot ; and “White Cargo” is attracting atten-
tion at the Royal. No relief from thg vocal
typhoon at present visiting the city is fore-
casted. Two hundred and fifty Philhar-
monics, under Alberto Zelman’s impulsion,
will give tongue to Gounod’s “Faust” on
July 19, 26 and 28; the Melbourne Sym-
phony Orchestra will accompany; and Elsy
Treweek. the Australian soprano, fresh from
English triumphs, will ride upon the blast.
'l*
Chefalo, the Italian necromancer, and
Irving’s quaint company of talented homun-
culi, are dividing the evening into two equal
parts at the Palace (Melb.). The dwarfs
are enacting the only dramatic tragedy in
town, and Chefalo is extracting from
lacquered boxes enough handkerchiefs to wipe
all the noses in Australia. As a magician,
however, he failed in two places on Saturday.
failed to fill the house, and he was unable
to produce his female partner, Palermo, who,
he explained, had been mislaid. A thorough-
going thaumaturgist would have drawn the
lady from a hat.
* ❖ ❖ *
Melbourne Tivoli is doing pretty well with
its present corps of entertainers, and no
important changes are projected. Coram,
ventriloquist, continues to talk to himself,
per medium of Jerry; Niobe takes her supper
under water; Gautier’s dogs make light of
carrying bricks; and Katrina and Joan are
graceful steppers.
* * *
Melbourne Bijou is doing its best with
the available material while waiting for Jim
..Gerald and his revue company, whose ex-
tended season in Sydney compelled the local
management to beat up stopgap talent, some
of it not of the best. The silliest feature
of the current landscape, in a laudatory
sense, is Claude Dampier. Huley and Bent
are taking the roof off a domestic establish-
ment that suggests Cro Magnon times, and
Fields and Yvette are a bright dancing inter-
lude.

At Hoyt’s Melbourne house this week
Alma Rubens is stirring up dark depths of
passion and intrigue against the background
of Siberia. What the Bolsheviks have
allegedly done to that pastoral country is
nothing to what Hollywood has madq of
it. A thriller is the supporting film, “The
“THE CLIMAX,” AT SYDNEY PALACE.
Guy Bates Post as music-master Luigi Gol-
fani, and Dennis Cardan as Pietro, the
master's son.
Ancient Highway,” in which Jack Holt
crushes a millionaire timber merchant and
earns a fair girl’s love. Two matrimonial
tangles are being unravelled nightly at the
Majestic. “If Marriage Fails” does it in
front of the scenery of gorgeous Venice, and
“The Torrent” puts to sea to settle matters.

The University Symphony Orchestra’s
latest costly garland included Mozart’s “Magic
Flute,” Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto and
the same gay giant’s first Symphony written
in the carefree days before his Delilah
sheared his hearing without depriving him
of his strength. Some of the music in the sym-
phony positively grins. Other offerings were
Cesar Franck’s attempt to be downright
angry in “Le Chasseur Maudit,” not heard
in Melbourne for many years, and Roger
Quilter’s cheerful Children’s Overture. The
assembled 95 gave a performance that should
be memorable in Australian concert annals,
but will probably escape notice in the jazz
uproar. Great enthusiasm can’t be felt for
pianist Edward Goll, however. He or his
instrument was in a dull mood.

Two Melbourne art shows :
With a book of verse in hjs pocket, straw in his
hair and a cold gleam in hjs astute and technical
eye, Blamire Young retreats annually into his
imagination (he calls it the Australian bush) and
emerges with a sheaf of pictures unique in water-
color art. The 1925-26 collection. is now at the
Athenreum. Each picture is a box of amazing
tricks made to appear like a version of infinity.
The gumtrees—if they are gumtrees—are griffins
rooted in the soil; their foliage, clouds caught out
of the sky; the sky is that amethystine blue only
to be found in a poet’s heart. Ail is phantas-
magoria evoked by a super Ohefalo of the brush.
An entire exhibition of such spectacular stunting
is a little wearing on the neck, but blamire Young
is the only pilot who can dp it, so let him carry
on. He is a priceless interlude in the procession
of pedestrian art.
Eight water-colors by John Eldershaw, of Sydney,
are the chief item in the show of Australian artists’
work at the New Gallery. The Eldershaws are in
his popular, romantic vein. An early Gorot by
W. B. Mclnpes; two pasturages by H. B. Harrison,
who has an eye for sensational effects ; a delightful
tone arrangement by John Rowell; a couple by
Charles Wheeler, who gets the same fleshly lonic
into his landscapes as into his portrait? ; and a well-
drawn lady by Maud W. Sherwood, whose mosaic
method is, however, rather irritating, comprise
some of the not very distinguished assemblage.
* * * *
A nother sort of picture-show in Melbourne:
Camera art has long gone beyond the point
reached by the Melbourne Camera Club in its show
at Kodak’s salon, Swanston-street. The bulk of the
examples seem to be lucky snapshots worked up
into pictures afterwards. Dr. Julian Smith’s por-
traits are only superior examples of what one sees
in the professional showcases. Nobody reveals any
definite temperament or viewpoint except, perhaps,
R. McLister, whose anastigmat exhibits signs of
having occasionally become inebriated by the poetry
of the bush.
** * *
“Quality Street,” opening at Sydney Royal
on Saturday, will start Dion Roucicault on
a long-looked-for sequence of Barrie plays.
Frank Harvey finishes in “The Silver King'’
to-night (Thursday), and takes ship for
England to-morrow. “Rose Marie” con-
tinues to do such good business at Her
Majesty’s that visitors intending to make
a week’s stay in Sydney are advised to book
their seats with their beds; and “No, No,
Nanette,” is pursuing new records at the St.
James. Popular Dot Brunton is packing the
Palace; on present indications it will be
long before “The Climax” is past. In “The
Last of Mrs. Cheyney” Renee Kelly is nightly
trapped in Dilling’s bedroom at the Cri-
terion ; and “Our Liz” fills the G.O.H. with
laughter and other profitable circumstances.
The Sydney polo carnival has helped in
crowding the houses ; managements must give
thanks for that event, vastly increased in
popularity, at a cold time of year when they
used to look for thin support.
Backhaus continues in his magic ways at
Sydney Town Hall. While his mighty chords
and cobweb pianissimos ravish the air, there
flashes into the listener’s brain all the beau-
tiful things he has read or heard or seen,
and “Excelsior” seems the only legend
•worthy to be blazoned on the banner of life.
There is a poem of Rod Quinn’s written to
the Harbor, each stanza of which Ililder has
re-created in his misty blues. If Bach had
seen those two before writing the Italian
Concerto which opened Thursday’s concert
it might have been said that he had set
them to music; and the third movement of
the Beethoven Sonata in E Major was as
hypnotic as a Maoriland river heard through
a curtain of summer willows. Strangely
enough, the poetic inspiration was not so
evident in Mendelssohn’s Spring Song—
rather a plump and robust crocus of a spring
song it was; but of the brilliant and melo-
dious Naila Waltz of Delibes (Dohnanyi’s
arrangement) the house had but one opinion
•—and that the highest.
* * * *
Chopin on Saturday night lured thousands,
and the luscious programme that opened
with the Sonata in B Flat Minor, introduc-
ing the celebrated Funeral March, found
every man present justified of his evening’s
choice. It was a great night through which
the rush and beat of butterfly wings, the
flash of sunlit waters and the cadences of
summer leaves wove themselves into a shin-
ing armor inside which one might defy
sorrow—or even Fate.
:|s :!<
The idea of the big-film story appears to
be the same as that applied to chocolates;
the thing itself is reached inside many cover-
ings. The latest offering of the Prince
Edward (Sydney), given its first screening
last Fx-iday, starts with a display of Ameri
can scenery, a masterpiece of photography,
and shows the conquest and obliteration of
an earlier cave-dwelling race by the Red
Indians before it gets on with the real story
of “The Vanishing Race.” After that it
proceeds with scenes showing" the relentless
and often horrible war of the whites against
“IOLANTHE,” AT HIS MAJESTY’S,
MELBOURNE.
Strephon (Lance Fairfax) greets his mother,
the fairy Iolanthe (Effie Armstrong).
the Indians, until it reaches Zane Grey’s
story. On the whole, this mass of introduc-
tion is the best part of the picture, although
the story is interesting enough, in spite of
the overdone villainy of Noah Beery. There
are, of course, the usual superfine wrappings
of music—the theatre’s orchestra is excep-
tionally good—and the prologue is supplied
by real Indians, imported for the purpose,
who give a display of camp-fire antics.

Although a somersaulting combination, the
Monroes are the leading comedians at Syd-
ney Tivoli at present; capable comedy is
blended into their more strenuous work.
Charles Zoli, of the “Wildflower” co.. does
reasonably well, and Charlie Lawrence chats
agreeably at the piano. In two other turns
billed as laughter-producing, the performers
don’t get the goods. Frankie Heath, how-
ever, has her turn doubled by encores; the
McLeans keep their industrious toes mov-
ing ; and Robin and Hood's acts on verti-
cal ladders earn their applause. Lee White
and Clay Smith are booked to appear next
Monday.

“The Prairie Wife” is amongst the few
pictures entirely free from the offences most
glaring in American films. It deals with the
problems of a young woman, accustomed to
regarding wheat vaguely as the stuff that is
the raw material for the loaf the baker
delivers, who marries a wheat farmer and
finds life in his cottage a difficulty; but ulti-
mately she shakes down into her environ-
ment. This is shown at the Lyceum. Pola
Negri is the central figure in Hoyt’s princi-
pal picture, “A Woman of the World”—a
story of a callous, fad-mad woman which is
only relieved by the excellent acting of the
star. “The Shamrock Handicap” is better.
** * *
Jim Gerald, after putting in 26 weeks at
Fullers’ (Sydney) with his revue co., leaves
at the end of next week, though, apparently,
his popularity would stand a longer strain.
The present sketch, “A Millionaire for a
Night,” is amongst his best—of course he
repeats them. Florence and Clifton work
hard for their money in a comedy gymnastic
turn, and four kiddies, including Baby
Leslie, a mite lately out of petticoats, gains
the most applause for the first part, which
includes also the Melford Three, in a scena
called “Plantation Days.” Two of the three
can be dismissed more in sorrow than in
anger; the alleged humor of the third needs
treatment with a pair of tongs.
** * *
Two art shows in Sydney:—
It is impossible to get away from the paintincss
of the pictures Miss Henrietta Irvine exhibits at the
Hordern Galleries. The artist belongs to a school
which believes that, though the Lord may have
made some good pictures, it wouldn’t be Art to
reproduce them; so the paint is put on in a way
that avoids the Other’s mistakes. There is a con-
siderable delicacy, all the same, in Miss Irvine’s
work, in spite of her tendency to lose herself, even
in portrait work, in mists. Many of the portraits
have a leaden quality, but there is vivacity in
No. 36. “French Girl in Profile” has a more lively
pose than most of the others; and “Wild Flowers”
(one of the pictures exhibited by (he artist in the
Paris International) and “A Child’s Head” (No.
25) are pleasing. Of the water-colors, which become
too misty altogether, “Kjrribilli Point” (No. 43),
“The Evening Star” (No. 46) and “Shower on
the Ranges” (No. 49) are delicately done. Miss
Irvine is a. sister of Vic.’s Chief Justice. Her
outlook and her subjects are more English than
Australian.
Bold craftsmanship is much in evidence in tin
water-colors of Daryl Lindsay, shown at the Mac-
quarie Galleries. He seems to have close-cropped
the world in order to produce his broad effects;
but that treatment hits the mark in places.
“Winter Landscape, . Bacchus Marsh” (No. 14) and
“Evening Landscape” are good examples of his
successes; so is “Barn, Clark’s Flat.” The com-
ponent parts of “Stable Yard, Morang” (No. 6)
appear to have been heavily outlined and then
painted in—a crude effect; and “The Lime Quarry”
(No. 25), although partly successful, is a jazz
effort. Daryl’s style is strongly impressed upon that
of his wife, some of whose water-colors are hung
also; and she is less sure. In one picture, showing
a mountain landscape with the hush of evening
upon it, she achieves something really good, but
in “The Yarra at Warrandyte” the treatment of
the water gives it an appearance of being cupped
in the middle, and in several of the tree subjects
the foliage seems to have been pinned on.
** * *
A thoroughly effective machine-made play
on French lines, everything happening be-
cause Bai-ry will have it so rather than be-
cause it must or would, is “What Every
Women Knows,” doing good business at
Adelaide Royal. As Maggie, Angela Baddeley
is a Marie Tempest without the handicap
of years, the increasingly popular Mary
Jerrold makes almost as big a with
far slighter onnortunities, and Brian Aherne
is as bumptious and unintelligent as Barrie
insists on tl ; hero being. Lillian Gish con-
to score, week after week, as the sob-
ful White Sister at Wondergraph, the York
strongly dramatic with Pola Negri, and
West’s has a wantonly Americanised version
of Mason’s “Winding Stair”; but the Pav.
provides all the fun, with Harold Lloyd and
Charles Chaplin in turn. Also Zelda and
John Juan are dancing beautifully at the
Palais, and the Veterans of Variety have
brought back tueir 011-timeo 1 1-time songs to the
Majestic, where their Australian tour started.
Poverty
point
“Nero”: “The Vanishing Race” —Austra-
lian actors.
“Caesar's Ghost”: The massive figure of
Allan Hamilton was well known in theatri-
cal circles in Australasia until slightly over
a decade ago, when he retired on the good
fortune his enterprises had brought him—it
was substantial enough to allow Ixim to have
a home in England as well as one in Aus-
tralia ; the English home was given to the
Belgian Refugees Committee during the war.
Hamilton came to Australia 46 years ago
after having been manager of a Calcutta
theatre for some time; he became manager
for Brough and Boucicault and later for the
Brough company—it was Ins knowleuge ui
India that initiated the practice of including
“Eastern” tours as a side-line for Australian
companies. Subsequently lie ran companies
of his own successfully. His widow is the

AS FAR AS HED BEEN TRIED.
“What’s the new manager like?”
“Well, he likes gin-fizz; but he doesn’t shy
at anything.”
in England that killed him ; the sunshine of
Australia failed to restore his health when
he rushed back to it.
“Stage Thunderer”: Melbourne dramatic
criticisms may shortly be expected to take
on a ruder note. The Firm has advised the
Age, Argus, Sun Pictorial and Herald
that only first-night passes will in future
be issued to them. Hitherto a couple of
seats for the staff and its lady friend have
been reserved every night for each paper.
Alleged abuse of the privilege is at the back
of the ukase.
“Curtain-Raiser”: Chefalo, the magician,
like all visiting virtuosi, was appropriately
received in Melbourne. He was entertained
by the Magicians’ Club. This body holds its
meetings at a spot midway between Space
and Time, and completely enclosed by a lofty
wall. The members enter usually by walking
through the wall, though some materialise
slowly from the carpet and others are pro-
duced by fellow-members from a pot. Club
fees are paid by coin extracted from the
secretary’s hair, and at official banquets the
waiters draw sufficient roast rabbits and
broiled ducks for any number of guests from
tlmir shirt cuffs. The appearance of the
head steward is another interesting feature,
but the less said about that the Better. I
have never been to the Magicians’ Club my-
self, but my friend the spruiker at the 103rd
picture-palace in Bourke-street (counting
from the west) knows all about it.
“Caul Boy”: Percy Grainger’s benediction
upon jazz led to a controversy in Melbourne,
into which leading conductor-composers
plunged, Bernard Hemze, of the Uni. Con.,
and Fritz Hart, of the Albert-street musicry,
taking opposite sides. The latter’s distaste
for negro harmony is a legacy from the time
when he conducted musical-comedy orches-
tras for a crust. When he was J.C.W.’s
conductor, he used to wave his baton to the
rhythm of “Wabash Blues,” but while he
did it he was quietly reading scores of his
favorites, Bach and Beethoven, propped up
on his music-stand.
“M.G.S.”: I can guess the answer to
“Blum’s” inquiry (B. l/7/’26) re Percy
Grainger’s declara-
tion that he prefers
jazz to Beethoven.
Grainger has been
long enough in the
U.S.A. to know
that no man, how-
ever gifted, can
push himself to the
surface there un-
less he develops
showmanship. A
plebiscite was re-
cently taken in ‘the
University of
Arkansas to deter-
mine who was the
world’s greatest
musician. Paul
Whiteman came
first, Beethoven
second and Pader-
ewski tied for third
place with Henry
D. Tooly. Henry
is “director of the
musical depart-
ment” of the said
university. No
public performer
who gets his living
in American can
afford to ignore such indications,
“Flaming Youth”: The recrudescence of
plain filth on the vaudeville stage is a matter
to which managements should give attention :
some of the “jokes” perpetrated by comedians
who find it necessary to wander on dung-
heaps for their laughs lack even a spice of
wit. In tile days when vaudeville was com-
mencing to be “polite,” and inducements
were being offered to Mr. Subbubs to bring
to variety shows the wife he had previously
left at home, I heard a well-known com-
edian perpetrate an atrocity at the City
Hall, Wellington (M.L.). The deadly
silence which followed it was emphasised by
the applause the house gave the rather poor
but clean following turn. Next day the
Fuller advertisements remarked pointedly
that the offender was off the programme.
Why not a little of the same discipline nowa-
days?
“Cmsar’s Ghost” : A small Birthday decora-
tion was sent last week to Mrs. Kendal.
As Madge Robertson she made her first
theatrical appearance 72 years ago, when
only five years old. She was soon playing
Eva in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” ; and she -went
on until she took one of the fairy parts in
“A Midsummer Night's Dream” ; Ellen Terry
was Titania. At 16 she played Ophelia to
the Hamlet of Walter Montgomery, and at
18 she was a Lady Macbeth. After that she
married W. H. Kendal, and entered upon a
London life which was a story of successes.
Her last appearance was as Mistress Ford
in “The Merry Wives of Windsor” at a
gala performance in 1911.
“S.G.”: One of the few Senators who
stuck out for more Protection against the
foreign film octopus was Burford Sampson,
the Digger from the Speck. Sampson ridi-
culed “the dismal doctrine” that “the Yankee
is almighty,” and that it is beyond the capa-
city of a nation with a population of
6,000.000, an ideal climate and high levels
of intelligence and artistic achievement to
produce good pictures. But he went on to
say that no good could come of turning out
“Australian” films “like one that was made
recently in Tasmania” :
The thing was simply a reproduction of Hollywood
traditions in my State. There were the same dresses,
costumes and every other American convention, and
the manner in which the osmiridium miners in Tas-
mania were portrayed was perfectly absurd. It was
not a bit typical of Australian life and conditions.
If we attempt to produce Australian pictures on
those lines we shall deserve to fail.
It is a true bill. The public is hungry for
honest representations of Australian life and
character, but who wants to see cheap imi-
tations of Hollywood garbage?
“Wigs”: One thing Frank Harvey is to
be commended (and remembered) for is
that his every character in Australia has
been played, as it were, off his own bat.
Unlike practically every other leading man
who has visited us, he never saw the original
of any of the parts he was called upon to
enact. He gave his own interpretation of
every rble, and invariably it was a good,
honest interpretation. Many of his char-
acterisations were gems of portraiture, such
as those instanced by “Nero” (I>. l/7/’26).
Pity he should make his final bow as “The
Silver King,” a part for which he is not
suited.
“Tuart”: Wellington (M.L.) has its
Repertory Players now, thanks principally
to Leo du Chateau, Maoriland representative
for the. Carrolls. With assistance from local
enthusiasts, the industrious veteran founded
the National Rep. Theatre Society, roped in
SkerreH, C..T., as patron, and produced
THE GUIDING EIGHTH OF HOLLYWOOD.
“ I’m hurt to think of your behaving like that with a man the
first time you meet him."
“ Don’t be so old-fashioned, Dad. It’s done in the best movies.”
Shaw’s ‘'Pygmalion'' in the Town Hall; and
Wellington newspapers agree that it was
a good production. Walter Bentley’s stag-
ing of “The Silver King’’ lias been mentioned
(B. 8/7/’26L Du Chateau was Bentley’s
Jaikes in 1897.
“Nero” : Plumpton Wilson, who had some
rough spins in Australia, recently concluded
a season’s engagement with Walter Hamp
den and Ethel Barrymore at the Hampden
Theatre. N’York. During the season “Ham-
let,” “The Merchant of Venice” and “Cyrano
de Bergerac” were produced, “Cyrano” with
uncommon success. Wilson, an old Ben-
sonian, was for years a member of Allan
Wilkie’s co. Another old friend who has
been doing well in Coolidge’s Republic is
Bob Greig, who has been playing a comedy
part in “The Student Prince,” the musical
version of “Old Heidelberg.”
“Private Boxer”: Eugene O’Neill, whose
“Desire Under the Elms” was banned in
Britain, struck trouble in his native America
with the same piece. At Los Angeles, of
all places, the company presenting it was
prosecuted for giving “an obscene and in-
decent performance.” The jury disagreed,
and presumably there will be a second trial;
if the witnesses are half as funny at the
next hearing the farce should be worth
attending. Picture-actress Mary Carr, called
for the defence, gave it as her opinion that
O’Neill’s drama was “a great w r orl< with a
moral lesson,” and passionately declared
that she had taken two of her children to see
it. It turned out that the infants were aged
26 and 22. On the other hand, a policeman
testified that he was so “painfully shocked”
at the performance that he “blushed.” “After
I left that place,” the sensitive slop volun-
teered, “I couldn’t look the world in the face
for hours!” Naturally, the play is still
being performed to big business.
“Lud”: Old music-hall frequenters will re-
member the Cragg family, imported by Harry
Rickards many years ago. They really were
a family and Cragg was their proper name.
Also, they were probably the finest team of
acrobats ever seen on the variety stage. Well,
the head of the family, J. W. Cragg, cele-
brated his 80th birthday last month. A
remarkable veteran, he is daily to be found
in his “academy” in South London giving
lessons to pupils in ground and lofty tum-
bling.
THE STANDBY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Asked to say what mascot he relied upon to
bring him good luck, a theatrical star now in
Sydney said he pinned his faith to his mother's
photograph.”
It’s chancy, luck upon the stage;
Your faith you’ve got to pin
To something if, a public rage,
You hope applause to win.
However well your wit may fizz,
Remember from the start
The ’eart that brims with bathos is
The surest form of art.
A Garrick may a house that’s cold
Encounter here and there;
A singer with a voice of gold
Strike icebergs fair and square;
Times are when, though your best you spill,
The public seems your foe —
A mother or her photo’s still
The suiest card 1 know.
There’s nothing beats domestic guff
When you approval seek;
True art is not the sort of stuff
That pays six nights a week.
You may be putrid in your acts.
Yet be amongst the “draws”—
Dear mother’s photo still extracts
The public’s wild applause.

PERFECT REALISM.
It is the one phonograph that Re-Creates singing or playing so
perfectly that the Re-Creation cannot be distinguished from the
original performance. This fact has been demonstrated by over
6000 public platform tests of direct comparison in Sydney,
Melbourne, New York, Chicago and other great cities.
THE WORLD OF MUSIC.
Needle-records can be played by the New Edison better than by any talking
machine. The New Edison also gives you Re-Created music from its own perfect
Re-Creations.
The Re-Creations are thick enough to give true tone without local vibrations, are
so hard as to be free from wear and breakage, and are so finely engraved as to
contain nearly twice as much music per inch.
The whole world of music is at your disposal as no other machine can offer it.
CHOICE OF PERIOD MODELS.
The New Edison mechanism is encased in sixteen different cabinets, each one a
pure period model. In these cabinets is reborn the design and craftsmanship of
the Golden Age of Furniture. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that
many of them will become family- heirlooms.
MECHANICAL PERFECTION.
The diamond reproducer has no needles to change or to be worn out before a
selection is half-finished.
The world’s greatest inventor stands behind this instrument, together with
£600,000 spent in research; truly it is the product of a master mind.

7500 miles across S. Africa
on a B.S.A. 4.93-h.p.
This is a 15-weeks’ journey recently completed
at Durban by Mr. H. E. Shroeder, over the high-
ways and byways of South Africa, a great part
where there were no roads: —
The first 4000 miles, from Cape Town to
Durban, were accomplished by side-car, for the
remainder, north through the Transvaal, Portu-
guese East Africa, Swaziland and back to Durban,
Mr. Shroeder rode solo, on account of the narrow
tracks and steep gradients (sometimes 1 in 4) he
had to tackle, the machine carrying a load of
150-200 pounds.
Churning for miles through sand on bottom gear
and crossing rivers where the water rose almost
to the top of the petrol tank, are some of his
experiences. Despite this the motor bicycle was
only twice in garage—once for decarbonising and
again to have the magneto retimed after flooding.
Mr. Shroeder has nothing but praise for his
machine, which he describes as a “go anywhere”
mount.
Mr. Shroeder, who is a wool expert, made this
tour to study the sheep of South Africa, and it is
noteworthy that he was a complete novice to
motor cycling—he learned to ride his B.S.A. in
Cape Town before starting his journey. Truly a
remarkable achievement for both rider and
machine.
B.S.A. 4.93-h.p. Motor Bicycle
A similar machine to the one ridden by Mr.
Shroeder. Specification includes B.S.A. counter-
shaft three-speed gear-box, clutch, kick-starter,
all-chain drive, mechanical and grease-gun lubrica-
tion, adjustable handlebars and footrests, ample
ground clearance, two independent brakes acting
on front and rear wheels, etc. For full description
of this and other B.S.A. models, from 2.49 h.p. to
9.86 h.p., see the B.S.A. Catalogue.
Motor Bicycles
prove as reliable when ridden by a novice as in the hands of an experienced rider
-—and the machine that will stand such gruelling work in South Africa will give
equally good service in Australia. Make your mount a B.S.A.

The Hampden Cloncurry
Copper Mines, Ltd.
TENDERS are hereby invited and will be received at the Head Office
of the Company, Collins House, Collins Street, Melbourne, up to
5.30 p.m. on Monday, the 23rd day of August, 1926, for the purchase
of the Company’s mines and plant situated on the Cloncurry Mineral
Field, North Queensland.
The property includes some 40-odd leases, comprising over 900 acres, also water
rights, etc. The plant includes a complete treatment outfit, mining equipment and
subsidiaries.
Offers may be made for the whole or any portion or portions of the assets. Transfer
of leases is subject to approval by the Minister of Mines.
MINES AND ORE RESERV ES. —The chief mines are connected by siding with
the Government Railways. The'Trekelano siding—approximately 7 miles long—is the
property of the Company; the other sidings are the property of, or are held under
agreements with, the Queensland Government. The Answer and MacNamara mines are
about 15 and 4 miles respectively from the Railway.
The Smelting Plant was closed down in December, 1920, and all mining stopped
except on the Trekeiano mine, where some 13,0UU tons of ore, worth approximately
1&.5 per cent, copper, was extracted and stored on surface.
The ore reserves in the main mines arc estimated as follow: —
Tons. Tons Copper.
Hampden Mine .. .. 20,000 containing 700
Trekeiano Mine . . . . 35,000 „ 3500
Answer Mine .. . . 7,000 „ 000
totalling 62,000 tons of high-grade direct smelting ore estimated to contain 4800 tons
copper These figures include the Trekeiano ore at grass above mentioned, and are likely
to be increased by up to 15,000 tons of ore averaging 10 per cent, copper from work in
the Trekeiano Mine down to present bottom level.
In addition to the tonnages listed there are some 1800 tons of ore, of equal grade with
Trekeiano ore, on the surface at the Duchess mine, which mine has still various small
shoots of ore unworked. There are estimated to be several thousand tons of fair-grade
ore—say 5 per cent, to 12 per cent, copper—in the smaller mines, containing 500 to 600
tons copper.
Siliceous low-grade ore (not included in the calculations above) in the Hampden
and Pindora mines is estimated to total 73,000 tons, containing 2190 tons copper, and m
the Salmon and Dingo mines there is exposed some 60,000 to 70,000 tons of low-grade
fluxing ore containing approximately 500 to 600 tons copper. There are on the surface
some 2100 tons of siliceous ore, and some 12.000 tons of low-grade ore.
The General Manager estimates that further development will increase the reserves
now indicated in several mines.
SMELTING PLANT. —This consists of one 18ft. x 3ft. 6in. furnace with an 18ft.
column, and is capable of smelting about 400 tons per day. It is equipped with flue
dust chambers with mechanical discharges and steel stack about Oft. diameter and
160 ft. high.
CONVERTING PLANT. —This consists of two stands and eight vessels capable
of turning out about 30 tons of blister per day (it has produced up to 45 tons per day).
This plant is equipped with modern overhead electric crane, having two lifts of 45 tons
and 5 tons respectively.
WATER SERVICE. —This plant consists of six 4in. and one 6in. electrically-
driven centrifugal pumps—capacity about 2400 gallons per minute.
POW ER PLANT.— This consists of three 210-h.p. Hornsby gas-engines and three
330-h.p. Kynoch gas-engines. Gas is supplied from two wood-burning producers,
having a capacity of about SOOh.p. each. The pressure-gas system is used. The engines
drive on to a common line shaft on C.I. pedestal bearings. Each driving pulley and
each drive from this shaft is connected by means of a friction clutch, so that any engine
or any drive can be cut out without interfering with continuous running of the rest
of the plant, which has commonly been run for over six months without a stoppage.
Should the plant be required for other than a smelting plant the drives to blowers could
be used to drive any other machines or plant.
ELECTRIC PLANT. —This is very complete and elastic and consists of two
125-k.w. and one 150-k.w. 460-volt, D.C. generators, also a converter for lighting
circuit of 220 volts, and one 56-k.w. and one 42-k.w. 220-volt generators for lighting
switchboard, panels, and all instruments are complete and all circuits on time limit
breakers.
POWER-PLANT BUILDING. —This is all of steel with overhead travelling cranes
in each bay and over all engines and machines.
The power plant is one of the most complete and economical in Australia, and is
highly recommended to anyone requiring a continuous power of, say, SOOh.p. or 700 to
1200 h.p. variable load.
MINING PLANT. —The mining plant at Hampden Mine consists of two 500-h.p.
Babcock & Wilcox boilers and two Cornish boilers, direct-acting winding-engine about
15in. x 36in., and Beiliss & Morcom air-compressor, compound steam-driven with a
capacity of about 1200 ft. per minute.
There are also practically similar mining plants on Duchess and Trekeiano mines,
and numerous smaller boiler and winding plants on other mines. Water-supply plant
consists of boilers and pumps, and about 8 miles of seamless steel 4in. piping—capacity
3000 to 4000 gallons per hour.
FOUNDRY AND FITTING SHOP. —There is also a small foundry and well-
equipped fitting-shop, with lathes, punching and drilling machines, shaping and planing
machines, steam hammer, rolls, etc. This is a very complete engineering shop.
CONCENTRATION AND FLOTATION PLANT. —This consists of large rock
breaker and complete fine crushing plant with feeders, elevators, screens and “May” jigs,
with a capacity on hard ore of 4to 5 tons per hour. Either the tailings from jigs or, if
required, the crude ore is then run through a tubemill to automatic sizing Spitzkastons.
This is a very complete little plant and comprises “Dorr” thickeners and tailing settling
vats, so that the water used in the mill is in a closed circuit.
FUEL, STORES, ETC.— There are also in storage the following approximate
quantities of fuels, etc.: —
Coal .. .. .. About 150 tons
Coke . . . . .. „ 1500 „
Ironstone .. .. „ 50 „
Limestone . . .. „ 1100 „
and there are large quantities of stores of all kinds.
SUNDRIES. —These include, buildings of all kinds, building material, motor-cars,
vehicles, horses, etc.
INQUIRIES. —Statements as under may be inspected jit. the Head Office of the
Company, Collins House, Melbourne, the Company’s office at Kuridala, North Queensland,

tarily submitted ; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany .
E. : No, we don't fear that mainly.
Our chief fear is that your great-grandson will be
half an Asiatic K.W.C.: Merely sweeps together
pars, already published... .Civis: Very stodgy....
Brevier: But why exaggerate in that absurd way ?
In what you call “the golden age of Australian
letters,” there wasn’t one man who made as much
out of writing in Australia as a hundred do to-day.
D.J.H.: Kb, that was a final reply to critics;
so-the matter is on the shelf for a while... .M.- Hay:
Too many words..... .R.G.H.: As commonplace as
21b. of beef sausages.... F.W.11.: No value without
the name of the firm J.R.L.8.: You must make
your points sharper and put it all into less space....
Mary M.; References to the Pankhursts date it back
too far, and there is too much of the facing stuff
at the end. Worth re-submitting. .. .Walter 0.:
Too many sweat-stains on your humor....W. Charn:
“Fool” is well done; but we've had that melodrama
so often we could go through it backwards....
D.P.M. : Yarn slight and conventional.. ...Neal: No
new ground;.. .S.C.M.: A month seems about a fail
thing W.P.H.: like an estate-agent’s hosanna
sawn into verse lengths... .L. 5.8,; Your short-story
version of Corelli’s “Sorrows of Satan is an instance
of hysterics repeating themselves.... Circo: If you
take all those words to say “kept in town on business
in a bottle” we shudder to think about what you
would need to kill your hero. .. .Graeme McD.: “It
will be easy to write more.” Yes, fatally easy....
M.L.S.: Your “Lines to a Cow” were, read to the
first we met. The owner says she has gone dry
C. de T.: Too long in present form... .D.M.G.: It
is the first verse of the - sentimental sort in
which we have seen “feeding the fowls” and
“the baby has pains in its bowels” associated....
Amos: Not up; but anyway, as one Australian to
another, why the “Say, Bo?”. • . J.H.L.: The hope to
meet the laughing-jackass in Heaven is right enough ;
but verses full of “thou” and “dost” are devilish
Slowcoach: A score of lines each commencing “Some
horses” are too much handicap for any Pegasus....
\V.C.: Sorry; some of the lines very awkward....
E.S.: Pretty-pretty little story; may do elsewhere
Dingo: “Physic-Analysis” thrown to the dogs....
W.L.D.: Not probable Rex Imp.: A mere series
of jerks Ripponlea: The mystery of the Demon
Child is thrice welcome :
The drooling infant ejaculated an appalling curse;
Then said another several times much worse,
The uncanny words seeming in the air to loitei,
While the father’s eyes were goggled as by a goiter.
Two years of age, she wriggled in her go-cart,
Destined to kill her mother with a broke-heart.
Then the sweet innocent babe made an obscene remark.
The Fath’r stagger’d backward, breathing hi ark.
His wife ran and gather’d it to her bust;
But flung it away, o’ercome by a surge of disgust.
Under the sofa it rolled. Inanimate it lay. , _
The poor frantic moth’r hysterically did--sway:
“’Tis a baby’s body With a foul fiends head on it,
Shouted th’ horrified husband as he made to tread
on it. ....
She crouched at his feet, invoking his mercy.
He heeded her hot. AVith an aggressive curse he
Groped ’neath the couch. He laughed. Tvas as he
feared. ... ,
The baby had swiftly and entirely disappeared.
. ...F.A.L.: “Hope” dashed by crude lines and
loose line-ends. .. .A.. 1.0.: Poor jog-trot stuff....
G. 8.: “The Yarra at Melbourne” is a drain upon
the imagination... .AY. J.T.: Sorry. “Maternity s
failure is in tonal quality—it’s like the picture of
a garden painted as if it were a battlefield....
F. ; “Shearers’ Cook’s” cake is dough. . . .E.D. :
Artificial. .■ . A.M.M.: Spring’s praise of “The Wattle”
given in too husky a voice.... A.S.: Drowned in
unnecessary description of the morning and evening
—which, after all, have nothing to do, with the yarn.
... .N.L.S.: Of par. value only ... .E.C.D.: “Mrs.
Blinkins” is a dreary female... .M.C.M.: Dingo
romance dull. .. .Mars: Those awkward unrhymed
endings would kill them in any case.... Dora McK.:
Not much promise in “Deserted Hut” and other two.
...R.N.S.: Re-v r rite “Absence.” Good idea; but
lines like “tender-sad or dark despond” are horrible.
. ...C.McE.: “Disillusion” too slight.... Hug: We
are specially struck on the fourth line: —
•Sing on, sweet bird ! Alas, bird, sing,!
To soothe my saddening breast !
Sing on, let. all Creation sing 1
AVith merry peels of rest!
D.C.L.: After that the girl ought to be satisfied
that you’re really going... .J.K.8.: Read your lines
to the lady. If she says they’re poetry she loves
you -• • .Phil R.: Your breathless adventure is spavined
with overwork B.AV. (Kensington): Your literary
stilts spoil a rather good story Monica H.: Sorry,
nothing new’ in “Psycho-Analysis”; the other lacks
interest Diana D.: Nearly; you might improve it.
~. .A.8.C.: “The Sentence” promised to be a nip
of whisky, but finished as a skimmed-milk romance.
L.M.G.: “I wandered with my lady”—l6o lines.
Suggested title: “Sore Feet” Gabba: Too full of
murder, among the victims being the English langu-
age ...!Danio: Consider how Calverley put the same
idea:—
That man is not complete in aught
Who is not humorously prone;
The man without a,merry thought
Can hardly have a funny bone.
P.L.C.: Sorry ; still lacks interest... .Paul; In
“The Goal winner” the verse is offside... .Hugh'J.:
“The Fern Cutter” has points, but is too much
like a ledger account... .C.J.R.: “The Rocky Road,
however rocky, isn’t half as rocky as your verse

“History of Australia” (11th ed.),' “Anthology
of Australian Verse” by Bertram Stevens or “A

CORRESPONDENTS.
0.A.J.: The leg is the limb of youth, but the

the busts of two men hovering above a crooked
street... .R.L.N.: “Unorthodox Parables” fell on
barren ground .... A.P.: Linework too finicky for re-

me incomparable Chrysler To Its Heart
The Chrysler Six is remarked
every time it exhibits its dash-
ing appearance on road or
highway. The contrast be-
tween it and other cars is so
marked that the desire to own
one is bred then and there.
But that desire is as nothing
compared to the delight
induced later on. For the
Chrysler is just as far beyond
comparison in performance,
roadability, ease of handling
and durability as it is in looks.
That discriminating people
have taken the Chrysler to
their hearts is no surprise at
all—it is a very natural thing.
They are almost extrava-
gantly enthusiastic about the
Chrysler because the Chrysler
has shown them long-lived
motoring delights beyond all
comparison.
Ask any of the distributors
listed below to demonstrate
for you the Chrysler’s many
advantages.

“Sturt” : Land in Adelaide has made an-

“ Jesmond”: The arsenic scare in England,
(B. 24/6/’26) should really help forward
the sale of Empire-grown apples, provided
growers maintain present precautions in
spraying. So far only apples grown in
foreign countries have been found to con-
tain arsenic above the safety limit. Neville
Chamberlain, speaking at the recent Clean
Food Exhibition (Lond.), said: “Arsenic
has never been found in any apples which
come from any part of the British Empire.
Therefore, if you want to be safe, buy Em-
pire apples.” Now'it’s up to us.
* * » *
“Emel”: the Italian invasion of Gipps-
land (Vic.) proceeds briskly, especially in
the Koo-wee-rup swamp area, where a drain-
age system has transformed land once use-
less for agriculture into soil commanding a
yearly rental of £5 per acre. Since the
Italians work hard, live thriftily and pool
their savings to pay the required deposit
on any desirable property that comes into
the market, they will soon realise their
openly avowed intention of making the thriv-
ing swamp township of Cora Lynn into a
“Little Italy,” a prospect that is viewed
with some disfavor by other sections of the
community.
* * * *
“Wanderer”: A finer prospecting field
than Guadalcanal one of the largest islands
of the Solomons, would be hard to find.
I have, by panning the Tenaru River about
five miles inland, had splendid results, and
have found gold, tin, copper, silver and
cinnabar. Also I brought to light a solitary
sapphire. The value of the mountains which
are the watershed of this river has not
yet been assessed owing to the dense tropical
growth making progress both slow and un-
comfortable. But I would not be sur-
prised to hear of a good strike at any time.
As against inaccessibility, a mine would
have the advantage of cheap native labor
and abundance of water.
* ' * * *
“Simon”: The unscrupulous • person at
Canberra who raffled a captured German
cannon reminds me of Ned. He was about
to leave our town, and decided to dispose
of his horse by the popular method. While
he was still selling tickets the prad died,
but was considerate enough to do the thing
quietly. Ned went on with the raflle. The
winner finally turned up in a red-headed
teamster with a reputation for belligerency
and a dirty left. Ned warmly congratulated
him without turning a hair, adding, “Here’s
his halter. He’s up in the gully paddock.
You’d better go for ’im on horseback in case
y’ can’t get near ’im. I’d give y’ a hand
only I’ve to leave this night for Sydney.”
* * * *
“Bulimba”: A sympathetic Queensland
State Arbitration Court granted the men
employed at the Brisbane meat-export works
15 minutes “cooling down time” before enter-
ing the chilling-rooms. Then the men claimed
an extra 10 minutes for “dressing time,”
and got that too. They had previously
. been granted morning and afternoon “smoke-
ohs” of 15 minutes each, in addition to the
usual meal times. Some bush lawyers
among the men argued that when they
resumed work after a meal or smoke-oh they
were entitled to another 15 minutes for cool-
ing down and another 10 miriutes for dress-
ing. But this was too much even for Labor's
Board of Trade. Presumably the men think
the product they handle can compete with
the world on such terms. Heaven only
knows how.
“Fez”: The bush nut of. the N.S.W.
North Coast has many qualities that recom-
mend it commercially. It is large and con-
tains a full white kernel of excellent flavor.
The only drawback from a commercial point
is its hard shell —so hard that one has to
use a hammer to break it. J. W. Banner,
president of the Mullumbimby P. P. Union,
has apparently overcome this defect. By
experimenting, he produced a thin-shelled
variety, and some of these nuts he presented
to the manager of the Wollongbar Experi-
mental Farm. Planted about seven years
ago, they have now produced trees that
are bearing, and the nuts have thrown true.
The cultivation of these nuts should pro-
vide a' profitable side-line for farmers. The
tree itself is a fine one for ornamental and
shade purposes, and its hard leaves resist
the attack of pests.

When George the Third was king and lord,
And North proclaimed his dread decree,
To Washington, with one accord,
The world was complimentary.
It hailed our Land of Liberty,
And sought the new States to endow
With garlands of hyperbole;
But no one seems to love us now.
We make the pace with Henry Ford,
And Wall-street holds the West in fee;
Yet all we gain for our reward
Is gold and animosity.
Barbaric lands across the sea,
The mild Hindu and eke the Chow,
Make jests about our hooch! For, gee,
There’s no one seems to love us now.
We boom, and yet the world is bored.
What’s wrong with our publicity?
Our Main-street virtues are abhorred.
As buncombe and hypocrisy.
Thanksgiving Day was once a spree
At which all nations would allow
A flow of bubbling pleasantry;
But no one seems to love us now.

CRAIG & AITKEN,
654 George Street, Sydney.
“Spike”: It is a wonder the dailies have
not awakened to the fact that round about
Manus Islands (New Guinea) a full-size
news-sheet is worth a bob. The natives tear
off a strip about six inches wide and a couple
of feet long, and with a filling of black
twist tobacco and a copious application of
saliva, turn out a huge gasper, which is
passed from one to anocuer, even the piccanin-
nies coming in for a whiff. P.S. —It’s no
good to The Bulletin. “Strong feller too
much,” they say after handling the paper.
“Ancient Mariner” : According to the Age
the Cerberus —the flagship of the Vic. navy in
pre-Federation days—-is now in process of
being reduced to the status of a “sheer-hulk.”
Actually there are no such things nowadays.
In former times a sheer-hulk was a vessel
equipped with sheer-legs for hoisting and
fixing masts, boilers and machinery, work
now done by more modern appliances erected
on shore. Even Dibdin blundered when he
likened deceased Tom Bowling to a sheer-
hulk ; so I suppose the Age will have to be
forgiven.
“Bris.” : A Yankee notion was sprung on
the Queensland Board of Trade the other
day, during a discussion of shop-assistants'
claims. Brisbane shops now close at 5.30
p.m., and when the shop assistants empty
out all together there is a wild scrimmage
for trams. The Traders’ Association pro-
posed that portion of the staffs should start
work at 8 a.m. and finish at 5 p.m., and the
other portion start at 8.30 and knock off at
5.30. They would not have to work any
longer hours, and would have a better chance
to get to and from work in comfort. The
union sec. was favorably impressed, and
agreed to take a plebiscite of his members.
“The Rumpus”: The Unfailing Optimist
has turned up at Dalwallinu (W. A.). There
was a heavy thunderstorm on a recent night,
and one reverberating clap caused a drauglit-
liorse, harnessed to a dray, to bolt into the
pouring darkness. It was not till next
morning that the searchers came on the run-
away ; the unfortunate horse had blundered
into a dam and come to a standstill with
only his head above water. AA r illiug hands
and other horses soon had the poor beast
and the dray on dry land, where Neddy col-
lapsed and died. “Aw, well,” observed the
owner, “I meant to soak those wheels to
tighten up the tyres a bit.”
“Bulimba” : The “Miss Brisbane” bathing-
girl competition killed the Brisbane City
Council’s puritanical bathing regulations.
Ignoring the Council’s “neck-to-knee” ordi-
nance, the bathing-girls (about 300 of them)
turned out for review in breast-to-thigh one-
pieces. Aldermen who inspected the beauties
at close quarters gazed approvingly on the
generous exhibition of bare flesh. “AVhat
guys the girl would have looked in neck-to-
knees!” one alderman told the Council later.
And another alderman clinched the argu-
ment : “No such costumes can be purchased
to-day.” The Council thereupon unanimously
resolved to rescind the ordinance, and
allow bathers to wear any decent costume.
But having withdrawn its bathing regula-
tions, the Council compounded with its con-
science by making a new regulation which
forbids tennis after sunset on any Sunday,
Good Friday or Christmas Day, or after
10.30 p.m. on any other day. Ping-pong and
mah jongg are still overlooked.
“Avon” : Following lines made familiar to
the Australian public in several States, the
Maoriland Railway Board, a new creation,
is engaging in a “safety-first” campaign. But •
it isn’t quite so embracing as its Australian
forerunners. Its sole object is to save the
railways staff from accidents. Shunters,
guards, porters and workshops employees are
bombarded with slogans and regulations, and
it may do them good. In the meantime the '
department runs its traius over level cross-
ings in almost every city and town, and
bumps two or three motorists into the here-
after week by week. The department says this
is due to the criminal folly of motorists, who
before they cross a line ought to get out
and see if a train is coming. It also reckons
that if the local authorities don’t consider
the crossings safe they should burrow under-
neath or build ramps over ’em at their own
expense. “This little bit of the world was
made for m.s-,” say the railway heads: and
they beg the rest of the population not to
worry them with any stupid arguments
about it.
BALLADE OF HURT HOUSEWIVES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At a meeting of the Housewives’ Association, the
President, Mrs. Gleneross, said that a member of the
House of Representatives had made the statement
that lie would prefer to see women clad in woollen
stockings rather than silk stockings. A delegate
(indignantly): ‘Oh, the silly old thing!’ (Laughter.)
Another delegate: ‘I think that he is unnatural!’
(Loud laughter.) Another delegate: ‘Men wear silk
ties and silk socks.’ Mrs. Gleneross: ‘Oh, well, they
do not look very different whatever they wear! ’
(Laughter.) The Association decided to place on record
its ‘pained surprise’ at the proposal to impose duties on
artificial silk, and its ‘profound regret’ at the sorry
exhibition made by men floundering into waters beyond
their depth.” —Argus.
What makes the gentle housewife wild and wet ?
Sugar that soars above a tray a pound;
Bakers who strive incessantly to get
An extra farthing for their white and browned;
Butchers who profiteer in rib and round.
And worst of all are Parliament’ry guys
Whose words awake regret still more profound,
Whose deeds occasion just as pained surprise.
AV hat makes the castle’s mistress fume and fret ?
Say, has the agile milk-oh, thieving hound,
An insufficient lacteal measure set,
Or some base cat upset it on the ground ?
If either has, he’ll know it, I’ll be bound,
But woollen hose for silk ! My hooks and eyes !
What Eve can hear such tosh without profound
Regret and healthy scorn and pained surprise!
What makes the missus narked? Well, you can bet.
Domestic cares are very seldom downed
W hen h.c.l. at every turn is met
And grocers’ bills incessantly astound.
But where’s a woman wouldn’t be shot or drowned
Before she’d show her legs to alien eyes
Encased in homely wool without profound
Regret, expecting nought but pained surprise?
Envoy.
Men, rulers in the House of Fury and Sound,
Stick to the things you know of, I advise.
Lest housewives read your ravings with profound
Regret and view yourselves with pained surprise.

In London Town.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I TOOK me into London town ;
I sought the tavern, called the Crown,
That lay hard by the street named
Bread ;
And loudly cried, “Mine host, a bed!
Some nut-brown ale, a red-deer pie!
A feast, a feast, before I lie!
A pox on thee—when shall I pay?
Is not the morn the first of May?”
The casement wide, lest I should drowse
And miss the early morning rouse
Of link-boys twitting apple-maids
And twining blossoms in their braids,
The ’prentices with aprons gay
And masters’ blessings for the day!
The ale was strong, and I, replete,
Betook my couch the dark to cheat.
My wakening was not to the cries
Of “Ladyes, buy my mother’s pies !”
Or penny poets selling lays,
Or “Lavender for him who pays!”
But to a thumping, bladdered fool
Who used a motleyed friend as stool,
And, leaning on the casement-sill,
Bespoke me lest I slumbered still.
“Up, up, my friend! Come, face the light!
Your eyes are shamed with yesternight.
There’s may to wear, and steps to dance,
A theatre, where players prance,
A maypolq where we’ll trip the course,
And ride the May King’s hobby-horse.
Come, follow me; I’ll show the way
To where we crown the Queen of May!”
At last arrayed, I set the fool,
Who used his tongue as folly’s tool,
To prise his way through crowded streets
Where vendors sold from lace to meats —
“What d’ye lack?” on every side—
Where fortune’s witches would confide.
So through the Cheape and up the hill
And downward to the meadowed rill.
And there I found the Queen of May
Was she whom I had wed one day
In Kent before she craved the gown
That brought her into London town.
I turned away. My heart was sad ;
The fool he thought my manners bad.
Mine host was pained ; I paid my score,
And sought me London never more!
victoria.
McCOWAN RUSSELL.
The Marriage of Melika.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FLORETTA was annoyed. Big and
buxom and half-Samoan, she stood
barefoot by a kerosene-tin three-
parts full of doga-bark she was boiling for
a floor-stain. She poked viciously at it from
time to time ; and when the eddying smoke
made her eyes smart she swore vigorously.
Melika came ambling amiably out of the
kitchen —a plump, lumpish girl, heavy-footed
and with eyes little more intelligent than
those of a drowsy ox. Rents were pinned
together in her loose • dress, and her un-
combed thick hair flared out about her moon
face.
“I do it, Floretta,” she offered blandly;
then, as Floretta swung round with the pot-
stick brandished menacingly, she wailed:
“O-ya-wai! What you wild to me
“You ought to be ashamed, Melika ! You,
a girl in my house, to have this one and that
one coming every day, every day to see you
—Fijians, Solomons, kai-lomas with mouth-
organs outside the window. No work you
do, and you make a talk of my house. A-h-h
—Bokola!”
“I broomed the house —it’s done, finish.”
Melika vindicated herself of the more easily
confuted chdrge.
Floretta’s mouth opened, but there came
a timely interruption to divert her wrath.
A tremendous outcry from the verandah let
the world know that her second youngest,
Peter, a lusty, bull-voiced infant of three
years, had tumbled headlong down the steps.
Melika took the occasion to get away.
But she did not go far. Her aimless-
seeming migration ended outside the honey-
suckle-grown fence. There the land sloped
abruptly over the bank of the creek that
goes singing through Levuka’s heart. Nor
was the creek’s the only music; on a round,
smooth stone, sunning himself in the early
light, sat a handsome half-caste boy, whist-
ling his content with the world.
Melika’s ox eyes brightened. “Jimmee!
Jimmee!” she called, heavily arch.
“Halloa, Melika!” The whistling ceased.
“Think of a pretty girl and she comes.”
“Oh, Jimmee!” Melika giggled deflight. Me
—pretty!”
“True you are,” Jimmie affirmed, afford-
ing another most glaring instance of the
blindness of love.
“Eilei, Jimmee! Floretta is angny to me.”
Melika reverted to her wrongs. “S|he say to
me, ‘Bad girl, you—you don’t do nti work.’ ”
“What else is she wild to you for?” in-
quired Jimmie shrewdly.
“She say,” said the heavy Melilqa, seating
herself on the green bank, “she say- too many
boy come to see me. I think she 'jealous be-
cause she is married woman, and Simoni don’t
like for her to talk too much to the young
men. To-day she wave the stick 'at me. I
tell you, Jimmee, I fright when Floretta get
too wild.”
“I think you better get married, Melika,”
Jimmie suggested light-heartedly. “What
about me?”
“You!” Melika’s mirth overpowered her.
"You get married! Why, you got no money.
I get married I want the silik dress, the veil,
the white shoes with straps. I doU’t want
Fiji marriage—no good that kind. (Floretta
now, she say every day, ‘Melika, yo*i marry
I ati Evans; he got money, the good joli.
110 like you very much. I like you both
board with me because you lonely wh en Pati
on the boat.’ ”
“And I get only six pounds a month on
the old cutter!’ mourned Jimmie. “I like
you very much, too, Melika. Every time I
go away and I don’t see you I thin k of a
song I hear one time.” He sang it with feel-
ing in a not unmelodious voice:—
“I don’t want to leave you.
My heart is sore,
Aching for you —it is so true
Some day I’ll come back to leave you no more.
“It is a beautiful song,” Melika owned.
“I like you, too, Jimmee, only you got no
money.”
“Melika! You, Melika!” The voice of
Floretta rose like that of a sea captain bawl-
ing down the wind. “Whoo-o-o!” Melika
yelled in answer. “Better I run, .Timmee.
She very wild.”
* * * *
“She is a fool, a big fool,” Floretta
asserted, and glared at her handmaiden as
that lumbering damsel brought in the mid-
day stew and proceeded to'* set it with the
pile of thick, battered plates on the table.
Simon McDowell, the three-quarter-white hus-
band of Floretta, peered with a melancholy
interest into the steaming dish. “Stew again,
Floretta! I think you could give us a
change sometimes. We had stew yesterday.”
He ladled it out in resignation. There were
folk enough to partake of it, since at the
bottom of the table sat Floretta behind the
teapot in its pink cosy and the large chipped:
cups and saucers, and around it her four
children and the boarder, a wide-faced
Samoan half-caste, waited expectant.
“A fool, I tell you!” repeated Floretta.
“Bertie Evans, he wants to marry her, and
she says ‘No.’ And Bertie says for them to
live here and pay me two pounds to board!”
“I think you could not do better, Melika. ’
Simon McDowell’s dull eye brightened at the
prospect of Bertie Evans as a boarder. It
would mean less work for himself, if more
for Floretta, and on principle Simon Mc-
Dowell disapproved of too much work. Which
was why Floretta took in washing and iron-
ing and boarders.
“Oh, Simoni! He have the funny eye, and
liis nose not straight.”
“Listen to her!” Floretta high
Heaven. “To hear her you think she’s the
king’s daughter!”
“Eilei, Eilei, Floretta!” lamented Melika.
“He’s a kai-India. I don’t like marry to a
kai-India.”
“Hear the big lie,” Floretta appealed to
the company; but Simon was mournfully
applying a piece of bread to the gravy in his
plate, and the wide-faced boarder, with one
eye on the remnant in the dish and the other
estimating his chances against the four
younger McDowells, all half through their
portions, was eating in haste. “He is only
half-Indian. You think too much of your-
self.”
“You should consider it very carefully,”
Simon McDowell advised the now-tearful
Melika. “Floretta only wants what is best
for you. You marry that Jimmie and you’ll
get no more rings and brooches like Bertie
gave you.”
“Jimmie!” Floretta's tone proclaimed her
scorn. “He’s too fond of playing the con-
certina. You get Jimmie, my girl, you have
to work hardI—like 1 —like me.”
The melancholy Simon moved uneasily.
But he said nothing. Floretta’s eye was
dangerous.
“Don’t, be a fool, Melika,” she went on
in a more conciliatory tone. “Because my
mother brought you up, I suppose I have to
keep you till you marry someone. Last night
when you and Jimmie went to the pictures,
Bertie told me if you marry him he like a
big wedding. I say, ‘Bertie, I got no money,
with Simon not working now,’ and he say,
‘Don’t you mind, Floretta, I buy Melika the
white silk dress !’ ”
“White silik!” breathed Melika raptur-
ously, Her tears vanished.
“Silk,” Floretta continued, “white veil
with lace, white shoes and white silk stock-
ings ! And he said for me to get cake and
lemonade, and he bring the beer. He pay.
1 make the table and ask everybody. I
think no girl in Levuka get a better wedding.
Besides, Bertie, he on the boat nearly all
the time; not like Simon, home every day.
You don’t see him too much. You marry
Bertie you live like a white lady, and I get
two pound a week.”
“White silik!” Melika lingered yet again
on the entrancing words. “All right, Flo-
retta. You tell to Pati I say ‘Yes.’ ”
The imminence of a wedding, and a wed-
ding moreover on the grand scale, brought
Floretta’s neighbors flocking in avid-eyed, so
that baskets of washing damped and ready
waited overlong for the irons. The melan-
choly Simon, as one anxious to do his utmost
to free Floretta so that she might make ready
the bridal gown and secure so princely a
boarder, went out and worked for three days.
Floretta, squatted down on the mats in her
bedroom, set the hand-machine whirring furi-
ously. There, too, the half-caste women, the
native women, salukas (native cigarettes) be-
hind their ears, congregated with Melika,
the queen of the occasion. For Bertie had
been as good as his word —the white silk
to make the wedding dress was in process of
that transformation! ; the shoes and the stock-
ings stood displayed on top of the chest of
drawers for meet a'dmiration. “Soba ! Soba !”
said the native girls in envious comment.
Meanwhile Jimmie whistled unregarded at
the gate in the romantic dusk, and Enoke,
Lasi and Meli, tjiose other disconsolate
swains not unfavored in the past by the
dusky Juliet, prowhfed up and down the road
in front of Floretta’fe dwelling. Bertie Evans,
on the contrary, basked in his lady’s appro-
val. But he found her a shade elusive. “I
think she don’t like me too much,” he com-
plained to the half-<easte Samoan boarder.
“Oh, she shy—all girl shy when marriage,”
that worthy consoled him. “Say Floretta to
me: ‘Melika she love Pati all right. She
one lucky girl,’ say'Floretta.”
“Well, maybe shte get no better fellow”;
and Bertie, compla'cent, surveyed himself in
his friend’s cracked' mirror. The rejection it
gave back showed a face that its owner con-
sidered not so bad when you excepted a
faint squint, a nose not exactly broken bur
so inconsiderately handled in some past affray
that it now bore & trifle to the right, and
a somewhat prominent gap among his front
teeth.
But if her bridegroom-elect was so easily
to be assured of her affection, Malika, revei-
ling in white silk and ribbons afld a gold
chain with a locket, had surprises in reserve.

daily bread and tobacco, Samu and the love-
lorn Jimmie sat at meat. The conversation
was in English, because the captain’s mother-
in-law sat just outside the open door placidly
smoking her midday saluka, and Samu Tubb
put not his trust in women—his mother-in-
law unexcepted.
“Huh-uh!” Samu grunted. “No good to
make dam’ row, Jimmee. Best you forget
.Melika—plenty girl, I think, better than
Melika.”
The lover was indignant.
‘‘All right! All right! Don't get wild,
my boy. But I don’t want Pati after me on
my cutter. No dam’ fear. I too old now
for tight.”
Jimmie leaned forward. “I tell you there
won’t be no fight. You know nothing at all,
Samu; you see nothing. And I tell you I
give not only one bottle, I bring you two
bottles of whisky, for you to look the other
way.”
The captain’s eye glistened. “Well,” he
concurred, “if I don’t see anything I know-
nothing, like you say. But I don’t want no
row.”
* * * *
Melika was married. Radiant in all the
glory of her bridal raiment, the gold chain
gleaming about her plump, brown throat,
she sat by her bridegroom, who, stiff find
uncomfortable, was barely recognisable in
his wedding garments. Floretta, arrayed in
her best, a mauve voile lavish with cream
lace and creaking tan shoes, had brought
out the .Christmas decorations to shed fresh
lustre on the crackling roast pig and the -wed-
ding cake that was itself a symphony in
l>ink and orange icing. Even Simon sur-
veyed the scene with less than his usual mel-
ancholy, though the howls of Peter, who had
been banished from the feast on the score of
extreme youth, were but now subsiding into
a mournful hiccuping.
It may have been that too many healths
were drunk, but it is certain that Floretta
presently saw the world through a rose-
colored, exceedingly pleasant haze, the de-
pressive Simon became comparatively cheer-
ful and even playful, and Bertie, never a
man to refuse a friendly glass, mused path-
etically on the jilted James. That agreeable
youth sat also at the festive board, since Flo-
retta, in the sympathy of a sometimes senti-
mental heart, had included him among the
guests.
"Jimmee, my boy”—Bertie rose unsteadily
to his feet—“you think I do you one bad
turn to marry Melika. Don’ you mind, my
boy. Floretta, I think good we drink
Jimmee’s health.... and by-and-bye might
be he get better luck; ’nother girl.”
Melika giggled. The bridegroom turned
on her a reproachful eye. “You don’ wanna
laugh what I say. I tell to you that boy's
heart broke.”
Through the warm and pleasant rosy haze
enveloping her. the thought penetrated to the
lulled brain of Floretta that to dance would
be to crown the illustrious night with amity.
Someone went out for a neighbor’s gramo-
phone ; the room was cleared. The wronged
Peter stirred in his sleep and moaned at the
thump and thud of heavy feet in the shoes
of ceremony. But the bridegroom was moved
to protest when Jimmie, emboldened by his
expressed sympathy, danced with the bride.
“Look here! That no good! I don’t say
Jimmee to dance with my wife. No fear!”
Floretta’s heavy hand pulled him down.
"Now, Bertie. One dance —that’s nothing.”
, Bertie glowered, but the glass proffered
him by the beaming Floretta restored ami-
ability to his eye. Presently if closed ; his
head sank back, and his lips parted company.
Floretta, sitting beside him, watched the
dancers through a pleasant haze that deep-
ened rather confusingly.
Half an hour later, while an appreciative
if somewhat dazed audience of wedding guests
watched a big-eyed girl dane'e a hula, while
Simon McDowell drowsed and the bride-
groom snorted gently and Floretta imagined
herself a happy balloon floating up some-
where among the sociable stars, Jimmie and
Melika slipped unnoticed from the revellers.
Outside in the shadow of a mango-tree Melika
paused.
Wait, Jimmee. I take off the shoe and
stocking. No good they spoil.”
A moment or two later the moon looked
down on a barefoot brown girl in her white
silk wedding dress and veil, fleeing towards
the sea-wall in company with a handsome
dark youth, who carried under one arm two
bottles of whisky salvaged from those pro-
vided earlier by the unsuspecting Bertie.
But the moon in Levuka has looked down
on stranger sights. Obligingly it sailed be-
hind a cloud.
At a jetty's end a dinghy swayed gently in
the running tide. Out in the stream the Adi
hani’s light winked genially. Melika sub-
sided giggling, her wedding dress kilted up
above brown knees to take no harm of sea-
water. Jimmie, casting off, pulled out
through the glimmering ripples.
.“You got the whisky, my boy?” The cap-
tain peered down benignant at them.
Jimmie handed up the bribe.
Samu Tubb, folding the bottles fondly to
ms bosom, turned pensively to regard the
horizon while the eloping Melika was swung
up on deck. “Ah, well—more better we get
on now, Jimmee,” the captain remarked plea-

My Interrupted Demise.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WIILE I was occupied, in my own
quiet way, with the unpleasant
business of dying slowly from the
feet upwards, there were two things that
greatly irritated me. One was love’s young
dream, which quite ignored my existence.
The other was the offside front wheel of the
coach. Far from ignoring me, it kept pop-
ping inside the vehicle, like an officious
neighbor, as though eager to see how my
demise was progressing. These two aggra-
vations between them at last interrupted my
death altogether. Not that I greatly minded,
because I was on holiday at the time, and
it is so annoying to die on holiday. I hold
that if one must die it should be done in
the boss’s time.
There was a reason for the holiday. I was
ill. Even the boss had noticed it. “You're
looking a bit off color,” lie remarked. “Need
a spell. Better, take a fortnight off.”
A bit off color! I was a nervous wreck
: —a physical dilapidation. I went off to see
a doctor, convinced that the boss had given
me a holiday for the sole purpose of letting
me do my demising in my own time. The
doctor, however, refused to share this view,
lie felt convinced I would pull through.
"Ibit what you must have is a change of
femperature—the more violent the better.
►Something cold and bracing. This coastal
heat has depleted you. Your nerves want a
jolt. Get cold.”
Get cold! Where is a man to get cohl
within a fortnight of Sydney in February-
real cold? What I wanted was a month in
the Antarctic or a refrigerator. But I hadn’t
enough cash to take me even to Tasmania.
The only hope was to get somewhere under
the shadow of Kosciusko. I looked at a
map. Coomut was the likeliest spot. The
railway went that far, and the dot which
indicated the place looked inviting, as though
it would be a town not devoid of such amen-
ities of civilisation as a bathroom and a
bar-room and an ice-supply to cool the beer.
After all, the doctor had ordered “something
cold.”
They sold me a ticket alleged to be for the
Coomut express. It proved to be the Coomut
incinerator. 1 arrived late at night, roasted,
suffocated, almost in a state of collapse.
Heat! But Coomut itself was even hotter.
By morning I was just smouldering ruins.
The proprietor, when he thought I was out
of hearing after breakfast, remarked to the
head-waitress: “That new chap looks crook.
Hope he don't die on me hands.”
In the bar, where the barmaid was cool
enough to keep any temperature in its place,
I mentioned that I had been ordered some-
thing cold.
"Better take the coach to-morrow morning
to Murphy’s, on the Saddleback. It’s half-
way to Koss.v. You’ll get it cold up there,”
the proprietor, with unkind eagerness, sug-
gested.
All that night I prayed for morning and
Murphy's. Morning and Murphy's and
something cold!
The coach left at 7 a.m., a cranky old
thing of an epoch prior to Cobb, drawn by
four skeletons and held together by bits of
wire. The driver was Sandy, about six feet
eight and of loose build. I suspected that under
his togs he too was held together by bits of
wire, like an osteological specimen in a medi-
cal college. My thoughts were running to
lugubrious similes. I was demising rapidly.
There was one other passenger beside my-
self. a pretty girl. She sat on the box-seat
by Sandy, close by Sandy, who. as he took
hold of the reins swung his head half round
on his elastic neck and warned me to “mind
that there wheel.” I was too ill to mind
anything.
The coach had no hood. By the time we got
cleat- of the town the temperature must have
been 150. Hot!
Sandy put his spare arm round the girl's
waist.
Then the good patch of road ended, and
“that there wheel” revealed its true nature.
The route was like a river-bed in granite
country and the axle-box must have been
badly worn. The resultant wobblings had
rubbed a hole through the side of the coach,
and at every alternate jolt the top of the
wheel swung in so far that an arc of it came
•clean into the vehicle.
It was slow going, uphill. It was getting
hotter all the time, and I was getting worse.
A nightmare journcv!
A new sensation was troubling me. but I
could not instantly identify it. I only
knew T felt as though the end must bo near.
And there in front of me were those two
damned lovers, Sandy manipulating four
horses round dizzy bends with one hand and
the girl’s waist with the other—a sort of
five in hand. And everlastingly that there
wheel buzzed in for a look at me, and out
again. I began to think of it as the wheel
of time, inexorably whirling me on to my
doom.
Then suddenly I identified the new dis-
comfort which was troubling me. In the
midst of all that sizzling heat I was getting
cold—cold! It was a curious unnatural
coldness, a deathly coldness. My legs
were growing numb —there was no feeling of
life in them. They wex-e so cold that my
trousers felt chilly to touch. It was like
the fingers of death fumbling up and up
toward my heart. It reached my knees—
was creeping up past my knees, up and up.
like the old coach climbing up and up to
a haven which, I realised, we would reach
too late.
And all the time that there wheel popped
in and out, squeaking everlastingly, as I
fancied : “Not dead yet! Not yet!” It was
maddening. Especially as I had by this time
diagnosed the trouble. I had heard of it —
creeping paralysis. I could not move my
feet. And still I had to watch those damned
lovers, indifferent to my existence, forgetful
of that wheel of time whirling on and on,
with inevitable death at the end—those
damned lovers, instinct with the urge of new
life.
The paralysis as well as the coldness was
well above my knees, and still creeping.
I could stand it no longer. “Stop!” 1
gasped. "I’m-dying!”
Sandy pulled up, turned his head round
on the elastic neck, and agreed. “My Gawd!
He’s dvin all right. You do look bad.
Mister!”
tiny thought it would be more comfort-
able to die in the shade of the vehicle. Sandy
lilted mo down—l could not stand on those
dead limbs beneath me. He placed me on the
grass and produced some whisky.
'AY hat’s the trouble, Mister?” he inquired.
“Heart!”
“Creeping paralysis,” I explained. “I’m
going cold from the feet up.”
He felt my ankles and agreed: “They’re
cold all right. Mister!” With no change in
his drawling voice, he added: “But that
ain’t creeping paralysis, sir! I know what
it'll be—warming up a bit, ain't you?”
Strange to say. T was. A genial warmth.
A feeling that I no longer wanted something
cold. And Sandy continued with the infor-
mation which quite postponed my untimely
demise:
“That’s not creeping paralysis, sir! You’ve
been riding with your feet on Murphy’s block
of ice.

The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
