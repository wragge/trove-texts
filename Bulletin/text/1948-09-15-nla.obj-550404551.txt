DERRY ON THE FOYLE HAS A LONG AND STIRRING STORY
J ONDONDERRY, or Derry, as it is known affectionally to Ulster-men,
stands on the west bank of the River Foyle, and is famous for its ancient
walls and stirring history, which is indicated in the city’s motto: “No
Surrender.”
Derry has its origin in a settlement which surrounded an abbey founded
by St. Columba in 546. This was burned by the Danes in the first of many
raids, and in 1164 the great church of Templemore was built on the site
where the present Church of St. Columba now stands. In 1311 Derry was
granted to Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, and in the rebellion of Shane
O’Neill, Earl of Tyrone, in 1566 a great battle was fought beneath its walls
which ended in the defeat of O’Neill, and English rule was firmly established
in 1570. Sir Cahir O’Doherty burned the city in May, 1608, but he was
defeated and killed two months later and his lands confiscated. Later, Derry
was handed over to the Irish Society of London, its name 'was changed to
Londonderry, and a large colony was imported, which coincided with the
commencement of its industrial prosperity.
The outstanding' event in Derry’s eventful history, however, was the siege
of 1688-89, when it was besieged by James IPs army, who completely blockaded
the city. A boom was thrown across the River Foyle to prevent the approach
of provision ships, but in spite of famine and pestilence and attempted
treason of the governor, the citizens held out for 105 days, until the boom
was forced and the relief finally completed.
The walls which withstood this siege still surround the older part of the
town and now serve as a promenade. A few of the bastions survive and a
huge brass cannon known as “Roaring Meg,” dating from 1642, and which
played an important part in the siege, can still be seen. ...
Londonderry is noted for its manufacture of linen goods, and during the
Second World War it played a leading part in maintaining Britain s Atlantic
lifeline.

DONALD OF CHINA .
Earl Albert Selle’s Donald of China
(Invincible Press, Ltd.) is too journalistic
in style and method to stand securely, as
a biography should, in the category of
literature. But Selle is, at least, a very
efficient journalist.
He has been a broadcaster in Shanghai,
a war correspondent for Reuter’s and, at
the time when, by interview and dicta-
phone, he secured from Donald (who was
then dying of cancer after his release from
internment in the Philippines) the
material for his biography, he was an
editorial-writer and columnist on the
Honolulu “Advertiser.” The story comes
direct from Donald, Selle transcribes it
with force and color and with a lively
appreciation of the vigor of Donald’s per-
sonality.
There is some tactful reticence about
Donald's private life, understandable but
regrettable if we are to have the complete
picture ; yet, on the whole, the portrait is
admirably drawn and conveys an impres-
sion of completeness. It is a picture of
a man six feet tall, robust of build, with
a rugged powerful face, a big nose and a
jutting chin ; a man who, from a sense
of destiny rather than from austerity, was
uncompromisingly a teetotaller but who
had, nevertheless, a delightful streak of
irresponsible humor and a linking for
-limericks; a man who felt he had a
mission in China yet obviously loved ad-
venture for its own sake; a man with a
great, genial liking for the Chinese who
could, at the same time, be utterly ruth-
less in the extermination of opponents,
military or political; a man who worked
and fought for a democratic China yet
was tempted towards the establishment of
dictatorship; a man revelling in hard-
ifiip and completely without fear: a man
of broad cornmonsense and, above all, of
force of character, unshakeable will.
For a typical glimpse of Donald in
action there is nothing better in the bio-
graphy than the story of the time when,
during the rebellion against the Manchu
dynasty, he charged the enemy, with a
solitary American for company, in a loco-
motive. General Ling had refused to
advance on Nanking because, he said, the
railway-line was mined. Donald and the
American —Roy Scott Anderson, manager
of the Standard Oil Company’s Chinkiang
office —commandeered an engine and
roared up the line to find out whether or
not they would be blown up:
They began to climb into the Purple
Mountain foothills, coughing and echoing
through steep embankments. Finally they
swept past a knoll—and there was Nanking
in the shadow of Purple Mountain, grim,
bristling. They were in the Manchu camp
and under the mountain’s ridge when
Donald looked up and saw the gleaming
barrel of one big gun, then four more.
Anderson saw them, too, and screamed the
locomotive to a stop.
“They won’t shoot,” Donald shouted,
his confidence springing, as it often did,
out of nowhere. “They’re more surprised
than we are.”
“Uh-huh,” Anderson muttered. He gave
the engine a full dose of steam and they
hurtled down the tracks in reverse, home-
ward bound. Donald was rocked back on
the coal, and he sat there laughing as
Anderson crouched low, intent upon his
job Roaring into Chinkiang, Anderson
tooted the whistle in signal of victory.
The sequel to the story is typical of
China as well as of Donald. General
Ling, now that the line had been proved
safe all the way to Nanking, resolutely
entrained his troops with their umbrellas
and muzzle-loading rifles, accompanied
by the executioners with their broad-
swords and the small boys who moulded
bullets —and resolutely disembarked them
again in the fields 35 miles from the city’s
gates. When the General had at last been
coaxed within firing range of Nanking
there was another hold-up because Purple
Mountain was assumed to have a gun
behind every rock. Donald climbed the
mountain on his own and found one
lonely emplacement, which, under his
directions, was destroyed. Then Nanking’s
gates were blown down by two 4.7
cannon fired by Donald and Anderson.
The story seems almost incredible; but
then, Donald was an incredible character,
a living legend ; and the Chinese are an
incredible people. Insofar as anybody
can make sense of their tortuous person-
alities and their bloody and complicated
politics Selle does so. Certain characters
emerge strikingly, unforgettably: Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, dreamy, utterly remote from
realities, planning, during his brief
Premiership of the Republic, a network
of railways running without regard for
mountains or rivers or chasms the length
and breadth of the country; the Young
Marshal, desperately enslaved by opium
and desperately curing himself, fiery
against the Japanese ; Chiang Kai-shek,
stubborn, silent, dignified, merciless.
There is a story of Dr. Sun in London,
kidnapped by * Manchu agents who
prodded their knives into his back as he
was walking along a busy street; there is
the story of the escape of Dr. C. T. Wang,
disguised as an old woman, from the gun-
men of the dictator Yuan. There is
Premier Chin, encouraging his one
crossed eye back into focus by concen-
trating his gaze on the long cigarette-
holder that reached to his toes. There is
Wang Chung-hui, who refused to become
Minister of Justice in Dr. Sun’s Cabinet
until a wife had been found for him,
peering delightedly through a window to
snatch a forbidden glimpse of the girl
who had been selected. And, among the
notabilities, Mr. Selle has not forgotten
the common people, from whom one
could choose, as the most Chinese of all
the people in the book, the coolie whose
business it was to sweep the courtyard
of the Customs House at Nanking and
who, during a great flood of the Yangtze,
was observed submerged to his waist,
sweeping the top of the water.
In the midst of all this lunacy, of revo-
lution and counter-revolution, plotting
and counter-plotting, there is—right at
the centre of it—the Australian W. H.
Donald... Donald as a young news-
paperman who had been offered a job on
the Hong Kong “China Mail”
the editor wanted a man who did not
drink... Donald butting his way through
the formalities to interview Chang Chen-
chun, viceroy at Canton for the Manchus,
and, as a reward for his blunt honesty
in refusing to have a drink with the
viceroy, being appointed Chang’s adviser
“on all matters pertaining to government
in South China”...
Donald, because of his connections
with the Chinese, discovering the Russian
fleet when it lay at Camranh Bay, shelter-
ing under French protection while it
gathered strength to meet its opponent
in the Russo-Japanese war... Donald
refusing to learn the Chinese language—
and he never did learn it... Donald,
when a Chinese gunboat had held up a
Japanese arms-runner, advising Chang
Chen-chun to defy both the Japanese
and his empress... Donald exposing the
Japanese seizure of the Pratas reefs, with
their rich guano deposits... Donald
“taking charge” at Shanghai when the re-
bellion against the Manchus broke out
prematurely and his fellow-conspirators
were confused...
Donald riding his locomotive, climbing
Purple Mountain and firing his artillery
at Nanking.. .throwing Japanese war-
correspondents out of a train.. .writing
the revolutionary manifesto for Dr.
Sun...trying to’ find a wife for the
amorous Minister of Justice...
Donald explaining to Dr. Sun that he
really couldn’t build a wall six hundred
miles along the banks of the Yangtze to
prevent silt-shifting in the floods...
Donald, when Dr. Sun’s republic was re-
placed by Yuan’s dictatorship,* helping
Dr. Wang to escape from the gunmen...
sending out to the world press the news
and the details of Japan’s Twenty-one
Demands.. .drafting China’s reply to the
Demands.. .telling Yuan, after he had
proclaimed himself emperor, that he
would have to abdicate.. .
A curious story, which Selle does not
attempt to explain, comes into the narra-
tive at this point. Yuan delayed his
abdication. He had promised to do so
by a certain Monday, and all that day
Donald, with Dr. Wang and Dr. Wang
Chung-hui, waited in Shanghai for a tele-
gram from Peking to say that Yuan had
kept his word:
In the afternoon Dr. Wang Chung-hui
and others came to Donald’s room and
began to talk angrily. C. T. Wang was
certain that Yuan had dbublecrossed them.
Donald sat quietly looking out across the
city where he had made so much history.
Smoke was pouring from hundreds of road-
side charcoal-burners, blending with the
summer’s dusk. He did not take his eyes
from the city when he spoke. “Yuan
hasn’t doublecrossed you,” he said. “Yuan
is dead.”
Yuan was. Certainly, Donald had
known the dictator-emperor was ill. But
still, it is an odd story.
The biography continues; and as be-
fore it is not merely Donald’s life-story
but the history of modern China. Donald
in Manchuria with the Young Marshal,
trying to cure him of his craving for
opium, encouraginf him in resisting the
Japanese, advising him to become “part
and parcel of China’s recognised Govern-
ment —the one run by Chiang Kai-shek,”
urging him to send a circular telegram
to the other separatists at war with Chiang
Kai-shek, so that “from that day, Sep-
tember 18, 1930, the unification of China
was complete”... Donald, when the
League of Nations Commission was in
Manchuria, growing tired of being trailed
by Japanese spies and, one night in Har-
bin, seizing two of them by the arms,
marching them back to his hotel and turn-
ing them over to a man whom he knew
to be their chief—“ Better find some
others,” he said ; “I know these fellows.”
... Donald flying to Sian to see what
the Young Marshal had done with the
kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek... Donald
in a car accident with Madame Chiang
Kai-shek after the Sino-Japanese War
broke out... Donald and Madame work-
ing together on the propaganda that put
China’s case to the world, helping to
organise the “industrial co-operatives” as
the long retreat began.. .flying with
Chiang from one place of refuge to the
next... Donald, at last, leaving China
for a holiday in the South Seas and, mak-
ing his way back, trapped in the fall of
the Philippines and interned. It was as
strange as anything in all his career that
the Japanese failed to recognise him.
Donald himself left no autobiography ;
he knew more about China than he cared
to tell. Mr. Selle’s book is the next best
thing. As the life-story of an Australian
who became a legend in China and as a
candid and well-balanced portrayal of the
Chinese it deserves to be widely read in
this country. Everybody who reatfs it
will enjoy it.
A Bundle of Plays .
Without wishing in any way to shorten
the existence of Miss Musette Morell or
Mr. Lionel Shave, one cannot help re-
flecting how pleasant it would be if these
two writers of plays could be reborn as
one playwright: for a dash of Musette
MorelTs spontaneity is exactly what
Lionel Shave’s plays need, while the con-
trolling hand of Mr. Shave would enor-
mously improve Miss Morell’s plays.
Mr. Shave is competent. His dialogue
is crisp, usually humorous ; his charac-
ters are clearly-defined for stage pur-
poses, and they do what he wants them
to ; hiS plots have a beginning, a middle
and an end and a swift and undeviating
movement; his plays are compact and to
the point. He is not troubled by a Social
Purpose.
Miss Morell, on the other hand, is con-
siderably afflicted by a Social Purpose.
She is likely to stop being a playwright
at any moment to reform the world or
bang a dictator on the head or expound
the doctrine that all poor men are good
and rich men are wicked. Whether she
really feels like this is very much open to
question. She seems, essentially, to be
fond of spiders and birds, but is not sure
what she wants to say about them or to
make them do. So she makes them re-
form the world. One of her plays ap-
pears to come to a point, but when it gets
there —a male spider has decided not to
be eaten by his mistress, but has not
solved the problem of how, by this re-
bellion, to produce the next generation of
spiders—the point is, so to speak, point-
less. A'bird play, wmch has not been per-
formed, does not do anything except fly
prettily around in circles.
But, then, one can be too competent;
and Mr. Shave is. Because his plays
would play smoothly they are not neces-
sarily works of art; and, in fact, they are
not. Mr. Shave is an exponent of the O.
Henry trick-ending, and, murdered by
this device, his plays are the equivalent of
the “magazine” short stories one sees—
or tries not to see —in the least intellec-
tual of the daily newspapers. Just when
the author has persuaded us that he has
an interesting set of characters in an in-
teresting situation and that, developing
his people naturally towards drama, he
is writing literature, he throws the whole
thing away for a “wow” ending which
has about as much artistic significance
as a card-trick.
Miss Morell does not do this sort of
thing. There is art in her artlessness;
there are sincerity and freshness. There
are imagination and poetry—a light and,
though pleasant, amateurish kind of
poetry when she runs into verse, but a
genuine poetry in atmosphere and emo-
tion. In one scene of “Webs of Our
Weaving” she really does take the reader
out on to the branch of a gum-tree in
the moonlight and makes him feel what
it is like to be a spider spinning a web.
In the bird play, though the piece as a
whole is as capricious as the wagtail that
is its central character, there is an amus-
ing pair of doves, rather bored with be-
ing the model married couple, and the
general flightiness is far from unattrac-
tive. Miss Morell doesn’t always observe
nature accurately, but she does care for
it.
Mr. Shave’s best play—elsewhere he
deals in suburban snobbery and early
colonial history, in murder on the gold-
diggings, in the contemporary murder
mystery and in what is alleged to be the
Sydney underworld —is “The Resignation
of Mr. Bagsworth,” a study of a banker
sunk beyond redemption in respectability
and routine. Here, as in the other plays,
there is a trick-ending, yet it is almost
“in character” ; it could almost happen;
it is not just a piece of trickery but a
piece of human truth—almost.
If Mr. Shave has here a play as sincere
as one of Miss Morell’s—almost —Miss
Morell has in “The Better Road” a play
as competent as any of Mr. Shave’s. This
is an Irish piece, after Synge, in which
there is a beginning when a rover takes
a job in a factory and an end when he
takes to the roads again. The dialogue,
however, seems too Irish even for the
Irish, and when one has had half an hour
of “The way I’ll be meeting up with you
oh my return from the old fox’s burrow”
and “So you’re going, is it?” and “Be
sitting for me under the trees,” and
“ ’Twas knowing you’d come I was,” ’tis
pondering one is whether something there
isn’t wrong with all this, and wondering
one is whether Musette Morell hadn’t
better be sticking to spiders.
And by sticking to spiders, and being
firm about them, Miss Morell might do
very well. Shorn of its Social Purpose
—or even, the young being resigned to
that sort of thing, with the improving
sentiments left in—her work should
appeal to children. Australasian Publish-
ing Co. has, incidentally, brought out
simultaneously with Three Radio Plays
a children’s book by Musette Morell en-
titled Bush Cobbers (a story concerning
a possum, a platypus and an echidna
which has beeh broadcast in the A.B.C.’s
children’s sessions); and Miss Morell is
also represented in a series of Australian
Youth Plays published for schools by
Angus and. Robertson.
The Youth Plays, edited by Leslie Rees,
are “divided into two series, Junior and
Senior, to suit pupils below and above
the Approximate age of twelve” and are
recommended by the N. S. Wales Depart-
ment of Education. The publishers are
looking for similar plays “of equal merit.”
Titles so far published are: “The Kooka-
burra Who Couldn’t Laugh,” by Peter
Batten; “Three Bad Boys,” by Mary
Hewitt; “The Squeaking Powder,” by
Elsie Pearson ; “Over the Ranges,” by-
Muriel Dalton ;• “Wait Till We Grow
Up,” by Coralie Clarke Rees; ‘The Jewel
Casket,” by Jill Meillon; “The Uninvited
Guest,” by Ruth Park; “The Happy
Revolution,” by H. T. M. Middleton;
“Presented Without Courtesy,” by Mus-
ette Morell; “Vendetta,” by Brian
Garde ; “The Man With the Money,” by
Phillip Abson; and “The Lion-tamer,”
by H. Drake-Brockman.
Both authors are published by the
Australasian Publishing Co. Miss Morell
submits Three Radio Plays, Mr. Shave
Five Proven One-Act Plays. Mr. Shave
is “proven” because his one-acters have
been successfully performed by Little
Theatres. His plays are recommended to
amateurs by the Playwrights’ Advisory
Board. Two of Miss MorelTs plays have
also been proven by performance by the
A.B.C.

THESE COMMONWEALTH BONDS AND INSCRIBED
STOCK MATURE AS FOLLOWS:
September 15. 1948:
2\% Bonds and Inscribed Stock
(issued in 1943 —three issues).
October 15, 1948:
3% Bonds and Inscribed Stock
(issued in 1934).
3i% Bonds and Inscribed Stock
(issued in 1934).
3|% Bonds and Inscribed Stock
(issued in 1937).
Commonwealth Bonds and Inscribed Stock
included in the issues listed on the right
have matured, or are about to mature. If
you hold any of these securities, don’t over-
look the fact that interest ceases on
maturity and your Bonds or Inscribed
Stock stop earning interest for you. But
you can easily prevent any interruption to
interest payments simply by converting
your holdings into the Sixth Security Loan.
WHAT TO DO
If you have ever bought Commonwealth
Bonds (War Loan Bonds, for instance) or
Inscribed Stock, check the maturity dates
of your securities at once. Here’s how to
make that check: If you have lodged with
your bank for safe custody more than £lO
worth of any of the securities noted above
you should have received a letter from the
Prime Minister, accompanied by a folder
explaining how your securities may b?
converted.
Cash Subscriptions Also Invited
Investment in the Sixth Security Loan
is not confined to those with maturing
securities to convert. Everyone may
buy Bonds for cash or by instalments
(for £lO, £5O, £lOO, £5OO or £1,000),
or Inscribed Stock, through any Bank,
Savings Bank, Money Order Post
Office or Stockbroker. Interest is pay-
able each six months at 3i% per
annum for fourteen years. Repayment
in full at maturity is guaranteed by
the Commonwealth.
Save for Security—invest to-day in
the Sixth Security Loan.
If you have not received such a letter, check
the maturity dates of your securities in one
of the following ways:
1. If your Bonds are in your own
possession. Look at them at once and
compare the maturity date printed at the
top with those shown in the list above.
2. If you lodged your Bonds with your
bank for safe keeping. M6st hanks issue
a receipt or acknowledgment for Bonds
left with them for safe custody. If you
hold any such receipts, compare the
maturity dates shown with the lists above.
3. if you cannot discover maturity dates.
Go to your bank to-day and ask whether
they hold for you any of the securities
listed above.
HOW TO CONVERT
If you find that your securities are about
to mature, ask your bank or stockbroker
for an application form for conversion
into the Sixth Security Loan. Fill in one
form for each series of Bonds or Stock
maturing and hand it back. That’s all.
You will then possess Sixth Security Loan
Bonds or Inscribed Stock of the same value
as your maturing securities, and interest on
your securities will continue.
CONVERT
Your Maturing Commonwealth Securities into the
SIXTH SECURITY LOAN

Rainfall and seasonal conditions in
the Forbes ( N.S.W. ) district during
the past five years?
Nineteen hundred and forty-three
(1695 points of rain) was a moderately
good year, 1944 (877 points) was the
worst year on record, 1945 (2061
points) was a good year, 1946 (1407
points) a moderately good year and
1947 (2408 points) was a good year.
Therefore, during the past five years
there has been the worst season on
record, two moderately-good years
and two good years. Up to the end
of June this year Forbes had received
1168 points of rain, but since then
there has been very little, and although
the district still looks well regression
is taking place. Rain is now badly
required to provide spring feed and
promote growth in the winter cereal
crops.

Pitt Wilshire’s family?
(1) He received a‘grant of 120 acres,
including Scotland Island. The island,
originally named Pitt Island, after
William Pitt the younger, then P.M.
of England, was renamed by Thomp-
son, who built a home on it and
carried on a prosperous business, in-
cluding farming, until his death in
1810 at the age of 36. It was then
advertised for sale and later became
the property of R. A. Murray, who
disposed of it in the 1820’s. Later it
was occupied for many years by a
Belgian named Dierekneckt, and" on
his death, sold and subdivided into
small allotments. (2) William Pitt
Wilshire was a son of James Wil-
shire, who arrived in 1800 to take
up a position in the Commissariat
Department, and Esther Pitt, whose
family had arrived some years previ-
ously bearing a strong letter of recom-
mendation from Admiral Lord
Nelson, to whom her mother was dis-
tantly connected by marriage.

If ranunculus bulbs are replanted
for a few years do they revert to the
one color?
Ranunculus and many other small
bulbs deteriorate when planted in the
same soil over many years, or revert
to a weak color, notably pale yellow
or a pinky-white. It is preferable to
get new stock or raise plants from
seed every two years. For the latter
fill a box with loamy soil in which
a high percentage of sand is mixed,
and sow not later than January.
Seedlings will be ready for trans-
planting in March, and bloom in
September. Lift these young bulbs
carefully, but do not divide them for
the first year, and store in sand.

UNCABLED ADDITIONS
Commo Glossary.
What some of the more hack-
neyed words and phrases used
by the vituperative Comrades
mean in their twisted vocabu-
lary, from a glossary compiled
by the editor of Pittsburg
(U.S.A.) “Press”:
Democracy —Russian Govern-
ment ; exact opposite of our
system.

to or criticism of Communism.

Too Soon For War.
An always acute observer of
Soviet moves, George E. Sokol-
sky, in N. Y. “Sun,” concludes
that the Russians do not yet
want war, despite much evidence
Ito the contrary.
In Sokolsky’s view, all they
actually want is disturbed condi-
tions everywhere in Europe.
“War would destroy their in-
dustrial base. They need to
establish an adequate capital-
goods industry to sustain the
needs of about a quarter of a
billion people. If they can have
peace for a sufficient period to
achieve this goal it would keep
them a primary nation. If they
fail, for whatever reason, they
will be reduced to peasants and
nomads.
“They do not want war be-
cause they believe —and this is
the heart of Marxist dialectics—
that inevitably the Communist
parties in Europe will sooner or
later achieve the proletarian
revolution and that the political
and economic unity of Europe
will be accomplished, under the
Communist International, by
revolution.
“Holding this view, they be-
lieve that peace will weaken the
capitalists as much as war will,
but that peace will strengthen
Russia while war will destroy
Russia. They want peace, but
on their terms as far as
possible.”
Anti-Russian Germans.
Looking closely into the pre-
sent Germany, a correspondent
of N. Y. “Times” declares that,
whereas up to a month or so
ago many Germans appeared to
believe' that German unity might
be won through co-operation
with the Russians, “today Ger-
man unity is envisaged as Ger-
man unity against the Russians.”
The correspondent expresses
doubts about such unity based
on “hatred and fear” of the
Russians. “If,” he asks, “the
Germans are to be readmitted to
the Western world, is hatred of
the Soviet to be their only pass-
port?” He would like to see
more evidence of appreciation
by Germans of “the immorality
of Communist totalitarianism”
rather than mere anti-Russian-
ism.
In the West v. Soviet clash in
Berlin the correspondent was
surprised to note the consider-
able numbers of Germans who
criticised any effort made by the
'Western Powers to negotiate
with the Soviet Union over the
future of Germany. There is in
Berlin, he reported, an appalling
lack of realisation of what a war
between West and East would
mean to Germans and to Europe
in general.
A hope suggested by this
observer-on-the-spot is that out
of the suffering and anxiety
aroused by the clash in Berlin
there may develop a genuine
German feeling for the Western
way of life and political forms
with an attitude toward the
Soviet Union based not on
purely nationalist grounds, but
on a larger belief that the pre-
sent course pursued by the
Soviet Union is a departure from
international morality.
“T h e general impression
abroad,” he comments, “appears
to be that this is the sentiment
of a majority of the Germans.
But it would be unwise to dis-
count the depth of vengeful
nationalism and hysterical anti-
Slavism which also has its place
in the German picture. Anti-
Russian, sentiment is common to
both states of mind. If it is
firmly based on moral considera-
tions it will have the greatest
effect in the future on political
forms in Eastern Europe. If
not, it will mean trouble.”
Leaderless Czechs.
While the names of the two
Masaryks and of Benes are
already to Czechs landmarks in
the history of their country,
names alone, Bruce Lockhart
comments in a “Foreign Affairs”
article, will not bring Czechoslo-
vakia back to democracy.
A free choice of the Czechs:
would bring it back overnight,
but they are in the Communist-
terror grip, without leaders and
with the Soviet armed forces
ready to swarm over the border.
“Today,” says Lockhart,
“there are no men of superior
talent or political experience in
the country, and until they arise
and the world shapes itself anew
no rapid change can be ex-
pected,” That might be better
put another way —that until
Europe is reshaped no demo-
cratic leaders can arise in
Czechoslovakia or in any other
Soviet-controlled country.
On the lost leaders Lockhart
comments; “Already decimated
by the Gestapo during the war,
the intellectual forces of the
country have been dispersed.
Some have escaped to face the
hard lot of exile, others deprived
of their livelihood and others
again forced by the necessity of
their daily bread to tolerate and
serve a regime for which they
have no liking.”
On the present state of the
country over whose freedom so
many got so hot under the col-
lar 10 years ago: “Outwardly
little has changed, but behind
this external fagade a cold terror
stalks the land. The judiciary
has become political. Freedom
of the press has been submerged
and a once voluble people re-
duced to silence in the open
places. A great tradition of
liberty has been broken.
Secretly, class is divided against
class and brother against
brother.”
Curiously enough, but typi-
cally, those who screamed
loudest about the sale of Czech
freedom at Munich are not now
merely silent —they condone and
even applaud the new terror.
Trieste Deal.
From Milan, N. Y. “Times”
chief European correspondent
C. L. Sulzberger has reported a
possible doublecross of Tito by
the Kremlin; Russia getting
square on the Marshal, and at
the same time strengthening the
Italian Communists’ shaky posi-
tion, by agreeing to the Western
proposal to let Italy have
Trieste.
As well as those considera-
tions, “there is no question but
that Moscow considers the con-
tinued presence in the Free
Territory of 10,000 British and
United States troops as a thorn
in the side of the Western
border of the Soviet zone of in-
fluence.
“The minute the Trieste ques-
tion is settled definitely there will
be no further reason for the
continuation of this base, with
its powerful propaganda value
emphasised by the continual
visits of strong British and
United States naval units.”
Britons Never, Never.
A few illustrations suggesting
that the poet who reckoned
Britons never, never, never
would be slaves was trebly no
prophet are quoted in American
papers from Ordeal by Planning,
by John Jewkes, the British
economist. Some samples:
A market-gardener requires a
new shaft for a wheelbarrow, a
piece of wood costing perhaps
ninepence. A licence must be
applied for from a surveyor of
the District Council on the ap-
propriate form. The licence has
to be registered and filed by the
District surveyor and then pre-
sented to, registered and filed by
the timber merchant.
The dispatch of a small ship-
ment of six drums of lubricating
oil involves the filling-in of 46
forms, requiring 42 signatures,
not including the customer’s in-
voice or delivery notes.
A firm is fined for making
60,000 frying-pans for the hpme
market, although it is established
by evidence that the firm had
done this only because of long
delays by the Board of Trade in
providing an export licence, a
licence which in fact had been
received after the fine had been
imposed.
A provincial corn merchant
operates under 15 licences and
160 fixed prices.
Mrs. Shenton, aged 79, is
fined £lO for growing too few
potatoes. She said she had re-
sponded to a Ministry broadcast
to grow more wheat.
N. Y. “World - Telegram”
economics writer Lawrence Fer-
tig comments on the endless
similar examples in Jewkes’s
book: “The price-fixers and
gleeful Government - planners
never seem to run out of confi-
dence in their pet schemes no
matter how condemning the evi-
dence against them seems to be.
The evidence, however, indicates
beyond doubt that wherever in
the world it exists, overall Gov-
ernment economic planning
leads to decreased production,
inefficiency, poverty and con-
tinued hidden inflation.”
Jewkes himself states in the
book that “No pen could fully
describe and no mind could
wholly grasp the vast mesh of
controls in Great Britain that
now circumscribe everyday
action.” | i
Austria the Test.
An unusually qualified
authority Karl Renner, his
country’s President —in a
“Foreign Affairs” article con-
trasts the apparently unbreak-
able West-East deadlock over
Austria with the professed war-
time aims:
“It was announced at the
Moscow Conference in 1943
that Austria, the first of Hitler’s
victims, was to be re-established
as a sovereign State with politi-
cal and economic security; but
agreement upon particulars now
appears impossible, and the
failure offers the threat of war.
“Is this small country worth
such trouble? Are the details
of the treaty which is meant to
restore Austria to a place in the
community of nations so im-
portant that they should be
allowed to disquiet the world?
“The answer is brief and
simple: the Powers are negoti-
ating over Austria —but they are
dealing with Europe. The ques-
tion of the political independ-
ence of Austria is a question
of the freedom of all the medium
and small nations of the Conti-
nent. The disposition of
Austria’s economic resources
raises the problem of the expan-
sion of the Soviet Union, which
apparently seeks to incorporate
other lands and peoples in the
Russian empire. The effort to
safeguard Austria’s intellectual
and spiritual freedom points the
choice between two ways of life
for all the peoples of the earth
the omnipotent State
and human rights, one-party rule
and Parliamentary government,
dictatorship and democracy. His-
tory and geography make this
small country the crossroads at
which Europe takes one of two
paths.”
On the Austrians’ own prefer-
ence of roads President Renner
declares that “the great majority
are certain that they wish to live
under a democratic regime.”
Though the future is so uncer-
tain, “Austria is remarkably
steady. She has maintained a
stable Government since the
war ended, and her social order
has not been seriously dis-
turbed.”
As he sees it, a strong factor
in that steadiness is “confidence
in the final triumph of the
United Nations,” though what
happened to Austria under the
old League would hardly seem
to warrant that optimism. Still,
“Austria’s territory is the
for war and for peace in
Europe; she does not believe
that she will be left in the lurch
again. The forces which make
history move toward a world
economy and a world State, and
in this direction Austria is glad
to go.”
Pernicious Literature.
Every so often there’s a great
hullabaloo about the Oread
effects on frail mortal minus,
especially young ones, of the
entire range from literary classics
to comic-strips.
The bogey is used in a variety
of guises to justify most censor-
ship, and even worked in law
courts to excuse murderers.
Raised recently in the U.S. in
regard to comics, it sent Robert
C. Ruark, of N. Y. “World-
Telegram,” back to browsing
over a classic of his nursery
days, with this result:
“In a do2en pages, young
Jack the Giantkilier committed
10 coldblooded murders. He
killed by trickery. He was
a stabber -in - the - back. He
looted. He was regarded as a
hero, throughout, and was richly
rewarded for a spate of murder
and mayhem that would make
the career of the recent mad-
dog killers, West and Daniels,
seem comparatively innocuous.
After all, they only accounted
for seven strangers.
“Jack scragged his first victim,
a giant named Cormoran, by
luring him into a pit and then
bashing him with a pickaxe.
Stealing the corpse’s sword, he
then proceeded to drop a noose
on, hang, and later stab, two
other giants. As an after-
thought, he liberated three starv-
ing women who were hanging
by their hair from a rafter.
“Callously, for personal gain,
he engineered the suicide of an-
other giant, in order to acquire
an invisible coat, an all-cutting
sword, an all-knowing cap, and
a pair of fleet shoes. He tricked
this poor fellow into stabbing
himself in the stomach.
“He then engaged in a brawl
with a magician who was exer-
cising his enchantment on a
beautiful lady, and cut off the
magician’s head. He was made
a Knight of the Round Table as
a reward. Employing sheer,
perverse sadism, he chopped off
another giant at the kneecaps,
before killing him, and lopped
the nose off another, just for
laughs. Sir Jack then stabbed
him in the back, and divided
his wealth with his friends. He
boobytrapped a bridge for Giant
Hundel, hanged him with a rope,
and then sliced through his neck.
In a final orgy, he slew another
giant, caused a wizard to be
blown away by a hurricane, and
married a duke’s daughter who
had been converted into a
female deer. For this bloody
escapade the State rewarded
him with a large property, and
he lived happily ever after with
his society wench.
“I could be wrong,” Ruark
concludes, “but I do not believe
that the offspring of generations
fledged ,on that heady fare has
much to fear from the comic
book.”
Dragnet Digest.
“Civilised’-’ Eskimos. London
“Times” voyages to the Arctic: “It
is possible today to find Eskimo
fishermen in sou’-westers and overalls
returning in a motorboat to a sitting-
room with European furniture, a sew-
ing-machine and a wireless-set.” And

The “Malayan People." —ln a
London “Times” letter former prin-
cipal adviser on Chinese Affairs to
the British Administration Victor
Purcell challenges with population
figures the Com. version of the
Malayan terrorists as a national move-
ment : “The population of the
Malayan Union (1947 census) is
4,878,000, including 2,136,000 Malays,
267.000 other Malaysians, 1,883,000
Chinese and 534,000 Indians; that of
Singapore is 941,000, including
729.000 Chinese, 74,000 Malays,
43.000 other Malaysians and 71,000
Indians. There is no ‘Malayan
people’ and no Malayan national
sentiment, let alone a national move-
ment. This is probably a misfortune
for Malaya, but it is a fact.”

Western Strength. —Summed up by
that reasonably experienced authority
Field-Marshal Lord Montgomery:
“Western Europe, led by France and
Britain, and aided by America,

commentators in our midst would
admit.”

Occupational Risk. —A verdict of
New Jersey Supreme Court, reported
by N. Y. “Herald Tribune,” classi-
fies a punch in the face as “one of
the recognised risks of carrying on
labor-management relations.” The
person punched, the Court ruled, is
entitled to beaefits under the Work-
men’s Compensation Act. The action
arose from a union official having
socked a company secretary on the
jaw. The sec. collects $l5OO com-
pensation, $350 lawyers’ fees and $lOO
costs. A Manufacturers’ Insurance
Company foots the bill.

Churchill on Germany.— From a
speech by Mr. Churchill at Bristol,
reported in London “Times”: “I
cannot think it can be good for the
world that we should continue to
nurse feelings of hatred against that
people which, by the follies of its
rulers and its own weakness, has been
brought so low. I think the time has
come when we should turn our faces
away from that terrible past and look
forward to a time when Germans
and Germany, probably in the form
of their ancient States, will take their
place again in the family of Europe.

“Silly and Useless” U.N.O. —Not
exactly amused, Chicago “Tribune
comments on the rise of U.N.O. s
budget from 19 million to 70 million
dollars that “new ‘functions’ are being
discovered all the time” and that
there are now nearly 6000 on the pay-
roll, “as compared to a peak of 1200
on the secretariats of the old League
of Nations and the International
Labor Organisation.” The U.S. pays
39.89 p.c. of all U.N.O. costs. “This
racket,” says Chicago “Tribune,
“has become so noisesome that even
the world-savers in Washington are
beginning to chafe a bit U.N. is
at best a silly and useless venture,
but in continually spreading out and
taking in more territory it is becom-
ing a positive pain in the pocket.

Britain Short of Smokes. Aus-

has become as acute as during tne
war. Long queues form at tobacco
kiosks as soon as they open, but
customers are lucky if they get
packet of ten in their favorite brand.
Most have to be content with lesser-
known brands or take Turkish varie-
ties.” Allowing for the time-lag, tne
effect might be a shortage of Bntisn

FEELING THE DRAUGHT.
Just a year ago the Federal Arbitration
Court, with some misgiving, complied
with the demand of the Chifley Govern-
ment and four State “Labor” Govern-
ments for the award of a 40-hour week
throughout Australian industry, in cider,
as the Chifley-led chorus declared, to
assure contentment in industry, and put
the coping-stone on “full employment,
whereon increase in production would
naturally follow. ,
There was no doubt about Mr. Chifley s
part in this mountebankery, and every
word should be studied in one particular
statement by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s counsel, which went far to force
the Court’s hand. It was:
The Commonwealth says to the Court,
through me as its spokesman, with con-
sidered words, that, after full consideration,
of all the material which has been placed
before the Court [before which the Com-
monwealth was a party], the Common-
wealth’s view is that the evidence given
warrants the granting of a 40-hour week.
These “Labor” Governments pressed the
Court —and the Bench said so—-to apply
the (40-hour) principle enunciated pre-
viously, “fully and forthwith,” on the
ground that “this was the only way to
settle disputes,” and so assure contented
productive effort throughout industry.
All the “Labor” Governments’ expert
witnesses declared that the possible im-
mediate fall in output of 3 per cent, to
5 per cent, through the shorter working
week would speedily be made up ; There-
after the “Golden Age” was to roll along
like 01’ Man River.
The political fathead leading the
N.S.W, Government contributed to
this pressure on the Court by legislating
in advance for the 40-hour week in his
own State; and six months later, when
production under the fewer working
hours was simply falling in a heap, Mr.
McGirr publicly stated that:
My forecast last June has proved
accurate that the shorter working week
would prove the greatest contribution to
peace in industry for a long time. I am
now in a position to say that it has acted
in most cases as a spur to workers to
produce their best and work at full capacity.
Mr. Chifley took no overt notice last
year of the statement in the annual report
of the governor of the Commonwealth
Bank that the supreme requirement was
higher man-hour production; and in his
latest report, last week, Mr. Armitage
tells him that “full employment” and the
accommodation of “new industries com-
ing to Australia” are in danger because
of increasing inflationary tendencies
from shortages of supplies.
These truths were the text upon which
two Sundays ago (for the first time in his
Prime Ministerial life) he addressed the
miners in their own industrial isolation-
ward on the coalfields. He still does not
go the whole way in frankness. He told
the miners that new industries are coming,
but did not say that present conditions
will prevent their arriving. What he did
say can best be appreciated against the
background of his public statements dur-
ing the past nine months —that is to say,
during the period in which his assump-
tions concerning the 40-hour week have
been blown to the winds, the “Golden
Age” has gone into limbo, and “full
employment” is turning sour on the
country. The background, then:
In December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said he
was concerned about shortage of dollars,
Australian demand for which seriously ex-
ceeded eaming-capacity. If only we pro-
duced more cement, timber and steel for
export, he said, we could import more
necessary capital goods for industrial de-
velopment.
In March last he told the Macquarie
A.L.P. Assembly that if Australia’s indus-
trial production was not greatly increased we
could anticipate economic disaster.
Followed a mild exhortation for more
production to the A.L.P. conference in
Sydney in June; and then, from London in
mid-July, his broadcast to Australian
workers that his own and the British
Socialist Governments were standing to-
gether in the “fight for economic
stability Hard work is not only a
national duty but the stern responsibility
of every Australian if we are to survive.”
A few days later he returned to Australia
and was asked by press reporters what this
meant. When he merely replied that “pro-
duction was one of the keys to the problem
that had to be solved,” it was obviously
not good enough, and he was asked
bluntly; “Do you think it necessary for
Australians to work longer hours to in-
crease production?” Mr, Chifley answered
that he “had not given any thought to
that aspect,” but he considered overtime was
inevitable.
When, therefore, he went with Senator
“Fixer” Ashley to the coalfields to talk
to the miners, Mr. Chifley was surely
due to come to holts with them. In some
passages he made as though to do it:
If the Australian people were to enjoy
a decent standard of living, the miners must
“do their bit.” He had come back from
overseas to find Sydney as restricted in
power and blacked-out as Berlin, and was
ashamed to see it. . ,
I After some stabs at the mmeowners and
saying that “press slanders against the
miners” came from “people who have never
done a day’s manual work in their lives,
Mr. Chifley joined the press critics by say-
ing there were “far too many petty, paltry,
piffling stoppages” and that coal production
would have to be stepped up.
In answer to a question, he said he was
not going to nationalise the mines, but
“only public utilities that could serve the
people best under Government control.
And then —“We have no intention of
nationalising things like rag-shops and ice-
cream carts.” Mine strikes penalised
hundreds of thousands of other unionists.
He appealed to the miners not to show
“the same arrogance as that shown in the
past by the capitalists.”
Those people who wanted chaos in order
to overthrow democratic government were
“fools and traitors.”
Hitherto these last have been for Mr.
Chifley merely “philosophers,” for which
the “Labor” party had room within its
ranks.
These passages mark Mr. Chifley s
changing point of view during the past 12
months. In the north the miners have
agreed to work an extra shift (if the
A.R.U. allows them) on alternate Satur-
days (at double pay), which seems to be
the sole result of Mr. Chifley’s exhorta-
tions.
The first real job ahead of any or all of
the Australian Governments is to restore
and enforce industrial, discipline. The
“darg” is throttling coalgetting; and to
expect the mining companies to instal ex-
pensive machinery underground which
the miners will not permit to work more
than 30 hours in a week (if that), and
even then often at a slower rate than that
for which the machines were designed, is
farcical and absurd. Yet the mechanisa-
tion of the underground workings must
go on, and coal is there in abundance in
the old “pillars” which the miners, defy-
ing repeated expert advisers brought from
overseas, will not allow machines to
touch.
As regards industry generally, the
socialisation policy here and in Britain
is not working out as promised; It is in-
ducing loafing on the job and indifference
about running costs. Consequences are
seen in growing inflation in our economy,
in alarming rises in costs of consumer
goods, and, as one company chairman has
shrewdly pointed out, the pitting of the
workers in their interests against each
other. “Full employment” is deadly sick
both here and in Britain, and is being
killed, by its selected partner, the shorter
working week. It is no mere coincidence
that the Attlee and the Chifley Govern-
ments, both stubbornly persisting in the
same Socialist wild-goose chase, are
visibly bogged down industrially, without
hope of recovery by their own unaided
efforts. What Sir Stafford Cripps said
last week in Britain, that longer hours of
work may have to be restored, is every
bit as true in Australia; and the state-
ments last month in Australia on behalf
of the Associated Chambers of Commerce
and of Australian manufacturers look like
the forerunner of a request for a
similar remedy from the Arbitration
Court.
Mr. Chifley “has not given any
thought” to the question of longer hours
of work. He says nothing to the miners
about the contemptible darg on output.
He refuses, in spite of all the evidence, to
cut down his own Government’s expendi-
ture so as to allow such relief in taxa-
tion as will stimulate taxpayers to work
harder. He goes on, month by month,
mopping-up available labor into unpro-
ductive Government “employment.” He
is, in fact, asking for the political axe
to fall on him —and he’ll get it.
"Labor" and Communists.
When pressed on the question, Mr.
Chifley drawls that Communism is a
“political philosophy ,” and that in a free
country you cannot ban a political philo-
sophy, and leaves it at that.
Other Ministers, however, are not so
complacent when they hear the dogs.
,Akiy cover is good enough for them, and
they show a surprising turn of speed.
Some, like Mr. Dedman last week, squeal
that they are victims of a “deep-hatched
plot” by the unspeakable Liberals to hang
“Communism round the neck of the
A.L.P.”
This operation should be reasonably
easy, seeing that one of the three
trustees of the N. S. Wales A.L.P. was
formerly general secretary and treasurer
of the Communist party; another, who
has been dragged out of his office in the
Australian-Russian Society by the seat
of his political pants, a former official
trade-union leader of the party. And that
story can be carried on and on. The
New South Wales section of the A.L.P.
would cease to exist if there were de-
tached from it, on the one side, the
liquor, racing and dog interests, and on
the other the Communist-bossed unions.
In the terms of the old Bolshevist slogan,
“Labor” has nothing of its connection
with Communism to lose but its chains.
It is an embarrassing situation. In a
counter-attack on Mr. Lang last week,
Mr. Calwell said that “if anyone in-
tended to ban Communism he must be
prepared for internment camps with 5000
or 6000 in them and another 5000 or 6000
to guard them.” A second proposition
of Mr. Calwell is that “Communism must
flourish while capitalism, slums and social
injustice exist.”
Here was the spectacle of a “Labor”
Minister confessing openly that he and
his own party, which has been in office
for seven years and which is so rolling in
the taxpayers’ money that it'does not
know what to do with the contents of its
Treasury, are unable to create conditions
in which Communism will not flourish.
He doesn’t say that while there are “capi-
talism and slums” “Labor” will flourish,
but that while those things exist Commun-
ism will flourish. Coming in such a con-
text and on such an occasion his speech
was tantamount to aft abdication to the
Sharkeys and the Dixons.
But Communism does not owe its exist-
ence in Australia to slums and capitalism.
It exists because it was planted here with
malign intention by an ill-disposed foreign
Power, openly bent on world conquest
and on the destruction of religion. The
objectives of its Australian section are
openly set out in its handbooks —“to
break up and shatter the State bureau-
cratic and military machinery as a pre-
liminary condition to the workers’ revo-
lution .... to break up and destroy the
capitalist State and police machinery of
bureaucracy, courts of justice, military
and police apparatus, and to replace it
with a self-governing mass organisation
of workers who could combine legislative
and executive powers.” It aims to push
suitable members into Parliament —not
necessarily as open representatives of the
Communist party —“not that they may
take the machine into their own hands,
but that they may help the masses to
destroy it,” and to “arm the revolution
to break the resistance of the landowners
and the capitalists.” All this is set out in
the Communist Party Training Manual.
So far from interning 5000 to 6000
people, according to the measure con-
ceived by Mr. Calwell, it would, and
should, even be possible to allow the
wide-open permissibilities of British
freedom to operate to the limit. Com-
munists, as well as others, should be
allowed to advocate a creed so long as
they do not incite others to the breaking
of the law and so long as they do not
link their own “philosophy” with illegal
and seditious action. .
All that is needed to deal with Com-
munism is the application of the doctrine
of personal responsibility before the law.
If a body openly avows, as the Com-
munist party of Australia does, that it is
engaged in a conspiracy to destroy the
State, that its objective is violent insur-
rection, and that it is promoting—not
merely by propaganda, but by action —a
“struggle outside Parliament in strikes
and other forms of mass struggle”
with a view to producing conditions in
which insurrection can be brought about
and the mob placed in control with (in
Mr. Thornton’s words) “arms in their
hands,” then anybody who organises that
conspiracy and leads it should be dealt
with as an individual under the Crimes
Act.
A body discovered to have been en-
gaged in seditious activities should not be
allowed to use the special privileges of
mails and newspaper registrations; it
should not be allowed to print news-
papers, or to have telephones or own
meeting-places any more than the Nazis
would have been allowed these things
here. Officials, previously members
of the Communist party or associated with
the Communist party in the past within
a reasonable number of years, should
be excluded from office in key unions
affecting essential production, defence
and transport —but particularly those
unions in which office would give them
special access to defence projects. The
Defence Act provides the means of doing
this.
The provisions of the trade-union
registration legislation should be strictly
enforced: At present there is strong sus-
picion that large amounts of union
funds are being used to provide susten-
ance for the Communist party. The law
in N. S. Wales, in particular, covering
publication of balance-sheets by trade-
unions is flagrantly ignored.
The Government, if it is to deal with
Communism, will have to ban its avowed
members from (he Government service
and particularly from bodies such as the
Stevedoring Industry Commission, upon
which it placed recently a prominent—
possibly the most prominent—member of
the Central Committee of the party, pro-
viding him with a remuneration at the
taxpayers’ expense.
It will also need to take another step.
At present any Communist leader knows
that merely by leaving the Communist
party and announcing the fact he can
step into high office in the A.L.P. with-
out even a decent pause for disinfection
—a man who was a “notorious Com-
munist” to Mr. Rosevear, Speaker of the
House of Representatives, in 1940 was
the Labor Government’s expert on post-
war reconstruction by 1943. The Com-
munist official of today may be the
A.L.P. official of tomorrow.
“Labor” can never deal with Com-
munism and take it from round its neck
while this state of affairs prevails. It is
prerequisite to the stamping-out of active
Communism that “Labor” must declare
—and mean it —that once a man has
been a Communist, and particularly a
Communist official, he is for ever barred
from entry to, or office in, the “Labor”
party. That should be easy—no ex-
official of the Liberal or Country party
would have a dog’s chance of entry into,
or promotion in, “Labor’s” fastidious
organisation.
As Good os Gold.
A couple of seasons ago, when wool
prices began their climb, doubt was here
expressed as to the capacity of overseas
buyers to find the money for it. Later
it became obvious that currency jitters
made wool as “good as gold,” since
anybody who had wool had a valued
asset.
One thing that now seems clear about
a complex world commodity, price and
currency situation is that wool is one
of the world’s most sought commodities
and looks like being our main source
of wealth for a long time: an argument
borne out by J, B. Mayne, an economics
researcher in the N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture’s “Review of Marketing and
Agricultural Economics”:
The demand for wool will continue to be
heavy for some time because the world has
not yet reached its pre-war production
figures... .Furthermore, increased industrial
demand is evident in many countries—
Further reasons for likely heavy American
demand are present popularity of woollen
goods in the U.S.A., increased demand of
the military forces, a rise of 12,000 ; 000 in
population since 1939, and a drop m U.S.
sheep numbers.
It is obvious, too, that the war-time
wool surplus is being steadily eaten away
under Joint Organisation control. In
three years it has reduced the Australian
surplus from about 6J million bales to
about 2\ million. This disappearing
surplus, stood against an evident world
decline in production and an evident
world determination to wear wool if pos-
sible, makes an attractive picture for Aus-
tralia.
Like South Africa, our production was
badly hit by the 1944-46 drought; but,
unlike the Union, our sheep numbers
have substantially recovered. The U.S.A.
production-decline, begun in 1943, con-
tinues ; the U.S. sheep population is the
lowest for 80 years.
There is a definite shortage of fine
wools, arising from both increased de-
mand and falling Merino numbers,
whereas crossbred wool production hasn’t
declined so markedly. Mayne, finding
that world wool stocks totalled 4415
millioh pounds nearly 18 months ago,
reckoned that they represented about 16
months’ stock on estimated consumption
figures. For the season ended June 30
last, world consumption of apparel wools
was put at 3400 million pounds (greasy);
probably, says Mayne, about 10 per cent,
higher than pre-war annual consumption.
In 1947, textile production was practi-
cally at 1938 levels in France, Germany,
Italy and some smaller countries, each of
which depends for raw wool on the
Dominions and South America. All that
is stopping expansion in British mills is
shortage of labor and fuel. At the end of
1946 the labor force was only two-thirds
of that of 1939, and there has been little
improvement since. Japan has to depend
on our charity for wool, and last year
her yarn production was below a quarter
of the 1938 figure.
One of the more significant develop-
ments is that of Australian woollen manu-
facturers. Before the war we had 90
woollen factories employing about 20,000
people and using about £7 million-worth
of raw material. By 1946 there were 114
factories employing about 22,000 and
using over £l2 million-worth, a figure
probably increased in the past 18 months.
All in all, Australia can thank her
sheep-runs for being able to sit rather
comfortably in a mighty uncomfortable
world, including the anarchy on her own
industrial front. And, though removal
of the local subsidy on woollen clothing
is going to hit the very people whom the
Treasurer’s income-tax “concessions” are
supposed to relieve, the country need
lose little sleep about the value of its wool
as far as the foreseeable future is con-
cerned.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Cement and Dollars.
Mr. Chifley and Mr. Dedman, under
fire from Abbott, M.H.R., with regard to
the background of Metropolitan Portland
Cement, the flotation facilities and dollar
preferences granted to it, passed the buck
to Treasury officials and the Capital
Issues Board, with the usual gibe that the
Abbott attack had been inspired by
“vested interests.”
A Royal Commission into matters,
according to Mr. Abbott, concern-
ing the Government, Mr. Chifley,
Mr. Dedman and Senator Courtice
was refused ; Mr. Fadden and Mr. Har-
rison were offered perusal of “the file,”
but not Mr. Abbott, who, according to
the Prime Minister, appeared “biased.”
The offer, quite rightly, was rejected by
the Opposition.
The Bulletin drew attention to the
Metropolitan Portland Cement flotation
within a week of issue of the prospectus.
This document, which asked the public
to put up £BOO,OOO, was vague and unsatis-
factory in various vital respects; and
attention was drawn to the history of
Arnold S. Taylor, a long-toothed and big-
mouthed company-promoter who figured
prominently in the float as a vendor
and adviser, and to capital inflation,
share-issues and -transfers in the
limestone company as a preliminary to the
major flotation. The whole Metropolitan
plan is really a revival of a scheme which
Mr. Taylor first tried to sell to the public
as far back as 1932. On whose behalf
is not known, but some picturesque char-
acters have been offering shares, though
the issue is claimed officially to have been
“subscribed.”
Arresting features of the thing were the
Treasury’s allotment (dollar famine not-
withstanding) of $1,189,110 for the
purchase of second-hand plant in the
U.S.A., and the talk of freight advantages
from the N. S. Wales Government rail-
ways. Raymond G, Hamilton, N.S.W.
“Labor” M.L.A. for Namoi, was holder
of 2500 shares in the limestone company
and is a director of the new concern. He
did some work in getting the float mov-
ing, which apparently did not involve
neglect of his Parliamentary duties.
Absent from N. S. Wales for a period
early this year, he found time to call on
Mr. Chifley “on one occasion,” which was
“not unusual,” according to the Prime
Minister.
If Mr. Chifley really believes that dol-
lars should be madfe available for the
establishment of new cement-worksi in
N, S. Wales —and with coal, manpower
and transport as it is that whole propo-
sition is dubious—he might have done a
great deal better than sponsor the pur-
chase of second-hand plant that is to be
set up a long distance from the source
of the principal raw materials and which
will depend for its economical working
largely upon rail-freight anomalies, “con-
cessions” and other kinds of preferential
treatment.
Mr. Chifley and Mr. Hamilton have
both referred to the “vested interests” of
the existing cement companies in answer-
ing the charges of Mr. Abbott. But the
Hollway Government in Victoria, re-
cently refused dollars to buy diesel loco-
motives for its overworked transport
system, must be wondering what Metro-
politan Cement has got that it hasn’t.
Hanlon Defends Himself.
Accused by Mr. Pie (Q.P.P.) of “selling
out to the ‘mimicking Molotovs’ at the
Trades Hall” in the now notorious re-
mission of fines imposed on Communist
lawbreakers and release of some from jail,
Queensland’s Premier Hanlon seemed
somewhat evasive on the question of who
paid the fines of Julius, Healy and
Englart:
Mr. Low (C.P.): Who paid the fines?
Mr. Hanlon: Pressmen in Canberra told
me the Liberals paid it.
Mr. Pie: You told us Archbishop Duhig
paid.
Mr. Hanlon: Dr. Duhig.
Opposition voices: That’s a different
person.
Mr. Hanlon: There’s a story that Dr.
Duhig paid. I would not say anybody paid
it without knowledge.
Mr. Nicklin (later): Who will get the
money that floated down from the clouds?
Mr. Hanlon: You won’t get that back.
Mr. Nicklin: Is it to be presented to
Healy and Co. as some compensation?
No answer recorded.
The Premier’s defence of his repeal of
the Anti-picketing Act consisted of an
accusation that the Opposition wanted to
keep it on the Statutes as “a danger to
industrial peace” ; that “Labor’s” actions
during the strike had destroyed Com-
munist “prestige” ; that his Government
had “adequately punished” the strike-
leaders and “established that the law
would be enforced,” and could therefore
drop the Act and the remaining punish-
ments. His party had “always recognised
the right of industrial unionists to picket
their places of employment” during a
strike. He held that repeal “in no way
interferes with the power of the Govern-
ment in the event of any emergency.”
All of which may, or may not, satisfy
Queensland, which cannot forget that the
gentry to whom Mr. Hanlon is determined
to be “merciful” were reinforced by
Communists like “Runaway” Rowe from
the South, all armed with plans and
openly expressing threats to “blockade”
Queensland and starve it into surrender.
That they didn’t succeed was due largely
to the good sense of decent unionists in
the South and an obvious tide of wrath
rising throughout Australia,
But they did hold up the State
for three months, caused thousands
of workers to lose heavily in wages,
planted divisions and hatreds between
workers which will last for years
and involved Queensland in a total
cash loss estimated at £2O million.
And, joyfully holding “victory celebra-
tions” over what they call the “defeat of
Hanlon,” and not at all impressed, but
rather encouraged, by Mr, Hanlon’s
“mercy,” they will unhesitatingly try it
again if the general Communist plan calls
for it.
Nowhere in the sorry story of Aus-
tralian “Labor” Governments who have
paltered with Communists and their dupes
has “mercy” of this sort been worth
a tuppenny dump. Advocates of violence
regard mercy as weakness, and weakness
in these matters is the distinguishing
mark of “Labor” —in Brisbane, in Sydney
and (most obviously) in Canberra.
The Nation's Pictures.
Tucked away amongst the auction
notices in “S. M. Herald” of September 4
is the announcement that the trustees of
the N. S. Wales National Gallery propose
to sell some more of the nation’s
property: to wit, “paintings in oils and
watercolor.” If the principle is carried
to its logical extreme —about 100 pictures
were sold in 1946, and dealers made big
profits on them—there is no reason why
Sydney should not wake up one morning
to find that the trustees have sold the
Gallery.
If a few rubbishy pictures are sold there
is no great loss to the nation ; but who is
to guarantee that the pictures are worth-
less? Was each picture inspected by the
whole body of trustees, whose collective
judgment might be relied on? Or by a
group of the trustees? Or by the director,
Mr. Hal Missingham, whose taste as dis-
played in his buyings for the trustees
would make most connoisseurs extremely
uneasy about his sellings?
Whether the pictures are good or bad,
the principle of selling them is wholly
bad. It will discourage anyone from
making donations or bequests to the
Gallery; it robs artists of the assurance
that a purchase by the Gallery is a
promise of immortality and a guarantee
of the preservation of their pictures ; and
it is opposed to the whole idea of trustee-
ship, which is to safeguard a heritage.
"Labor's" Bedfellows.
While Mr. Chifley is changing his de-
scription of “Labor’s” Communist bed-
fellows from “political philosophers” to
“fools and traitors,” Calwell, whose name
Tel Aviv once wrote on its heart, thinks
they are merely something like the in-
fluenza germs that blow about the world
—a malnutrition disease.
The remedy for Communism, he told
Parliament in the Address-in-reply
debate, is not to ban Communists as
subversive foreign agents, but to cure the
conditions in which they flourish. “Where
you have misery and social injustice,
there you have Communism.”
If, unlike the flowers blooming this
spring, this has anything to do with the
Australian case, it must be equally true
that “where you have Communists there
you have economic misery.” Would
Calwell affirm that Communism is rife
in Australian unions because of
wretched conditions under Labor
rule? And what a sink of misery and
social injustice must Russia be!
In the same debate Lang had charged
the Government with allowing Commu-
nists to plant their traitors in key posi-
tions in Government departments. Cal-
well retorted that he lied. Lang came
back with a question and alleged a
specific instance in Senator Cameron s
P.M.G.’s department.
But Chifley’s reign in office does not
depend solely upon the support of the
Trades Hall industrialists and these Com-
munist bedfellows with whom the misery
of which Calwell speaks makes them
acquainted. It depends very much upon
the great backbone of Australian labor
in the staple industries of the land, the
A.W.U. The A.W.U. has now apparently
taken the warpath. Last summer it
crossed swords with the Miners’ Federa-
tion in Queensland, S.A. and Westralia,
and with the whole Communist director-
ate of revolutionary wreckers in the trans-
port blockade of Queensland. A second
round is now beginning. The Queensland
branch of the A.W.U. has published a
pamphlet declaring the Communists as
Maoriland’s Robert Semple did after his
recent Australian visit—to be “a menace
to the British Empire and Australia and
a threat to world peace.” The A.W.U.’s
Victorian State branch simultaneously
warns all other unions in its current
monthly journal:
The moment a trade-union falls into
the hands of the Communists it becomes
only a caricature of a trade-union. It be-
comes no more than an agency of the
foreign policy of the Soviet Union.
For nine months past 39 members of
the A.W.U, in N.S.W. have been engaged
on preparatory work for a three-mile
rock tunnel (now due to begin) to open
up a coal seam between the Mt. Kembla
and Mt. Keira workings. The Miners’
executive last week demanded that these

workers shall join their Federation, fail-
ing which it would lay idle all South
Coast mines. The A.W.U. told the
miners’ bosses to go jump in the Pacific,
and its secretary added:
If the people of Australia are to be de-
pendent for their coal on the Communist
leaders of the Miners’ Federation, then the
sooner the showdown comes the better.
If the Chifleys won’t tackle the Com-
munist problem—one largely of their own
making—and the A.W.U. decides to do
so in earnest, Chifley’s Caucus will have
something to think about besides ways
and means of juggling the new electoral
boundaries.
POLITICAL POINTS
Monthly Treasury figures show that the
Commonwealth collected £13,420,000
more revenue in July and August than
it did in the same period last year. And
its collections for the two months totalled
£81,504,000, or not much less than the
amount collected for the whole year in
1938. Veritably it is Chifley’s Golden
Age—for Chifley.
France achieved a Government (in
name alone) last week under Dr.
Queuille, with Schuman as Foreign
Minister and the Socialist Ramadier as
Defence Minister. Communists were
“clashing” with police, strikes simmered
and Queuille was trying to speed up
Marshall Aid when De Gaulle was heard
from, demanding a general election. Cost
of living and the general instability of
almost daily changes of Government
make Dr. Queuille’s Ministry a poor bet.
Ever since the general elections of
1946, France has been ringing the
changes with every possible permutation
and combination of her multiple political
parties in the effort to form a stable
Government. Quite like pre-war times ;
none of them has lasted for longer than
it took members supporting to find out
that the country must pay its way by
hard work and taxation —means the more
detested by a war-wracked electorate
which had supposed the rich American
uncle would put up some easy money.
The signs all point to another election
and the return of the autocrat De Gaulle
—though he can have no remedy outside
those already propounded.
At a “cost to revenue” of £2O million
this year Mr. Chifley has made some tax
concessions’, but he expects his gross tax
revenue to rise £lB million notwithstand-
ing. And the public will pay at least
another £25 million this year in living
costs through Canberra’s abandonment of
most price subsidies. Details:

Thus Professor Browne, Professor of
Education at Melbourne University, at
the “Pacific Assembly” in Brisbane:
We can learn one thing from the United
States and Hawaii —that is, that we need
not fear bringing in new races provided the
stock is good.
The Hawaiian population statistics pro-
vide their own comment on the profes-
sor’s view: Japanese, 157,905; Filipinos,
52,148 ; part - Hawaiians, 42,000 ;
Hawaiians, 21,000; Chinese, 28,809 ;
Puerto Ricans, 7781 ; Koreans, 6761; and
Caucasians, 108,000. The proportiojn of
Caucasians and pure Hawaiians is on the
decline.
Of yore, when an opponent asked for
an inquiry into charges affecting the
conduct of a Minister of the Crown, it
was the custom for the Minister to de-
mand that his name be publicly cleared.
Under the Chifley regime it is deemed
sufficient in such cases for the Minister
to give himself a testimonial and to infer
that the inquiring opponent is “unbal-
anced mentally” (said of Blain, M.P.,
who was inquisitive about Dr. Evatt), or
“has a few palings off the fence” (of
Mr, J. P. Abbott, who inquired about the
Commonwealth’s allocation of dollars to
a concern engaging in cement manufac-
ture). With all due deference to the New
Order, the old-fashioned procedure was
the more convincing.
The new Burmese Parliament is a
splendid example of the kind of demo-
cracy which “freedom” has brought to
Southern Asia. At the meeting of the
Lower House the other day, 150 members
were present and 100 absent, including 17
detained under the Public Order Act.
The House was surrounded by a hedge
of machine-guns and bayonets, and while
it passed a “Nationality” Act at least
four of its nations were in rebellion.
Chifley’s talk to the miners about “do-
ing their bit for Australia” was a test
of his personal influence. His personal
influence as the most profligate Treasurer
the Commonwealth has ever had was
quickly apparent. The miners voted
without enthusiasm for an extra shift on
“back-Saturdays” (at double time), but
the railwaymen who haul the coal stuck
out for double-time and two-thirds!
Thus is Chifley’s administration an ex-
ample to the unions.
Offered a Liberal Speaker if he’d agree
to a coalition Government, Tasmanian
Premier Cosgrove tartly refused. So a
Speaker came from his own cohorts, and
Tasmania has a Labor Government de-
pending on Independent support. It
survived a first vote, but how long it can
carry on is in the lap of the Independents,
Adermann (C.P.) hinted in the Canberra
Parliament last week that Hanlon’s
sudden decision to be “merciful” to the
Communist lawbreakers and release
them from jail followed words between
Hanlon and Chifley during the Premiers’
conference. Whatever the cause, the
Corns held a “victory social” to
celebrate what they continue to call the
defeat of Hanlon, and Hanlon, now on
his way to London, left with accusations
of causing an A.L.R, “split” ringing in his
ears.
The Chifley financial policy is clear,
and Caucus approval of it, faint-
hearted now, is likely to lose some edge
by election-time. The Chifley argument
is that the citizen does not know the
value of his (or her) money, that he (or
she) cannot be trusted to spend it wisely,
and therefore it is much better that
Chifley should continue to take and spend
it for everyone, since only the Govern-
ment knows what is best to buy for us.
Anyone who doubts that need only look
at what Chifley is spending the money
on.
Dr. A. J. Metcalfe, Commonwealth
Director-General of Health, denies the
report (B. 1/9/’4B) that, after “a world
tour of inspection of ‘nationalised’
schemes,” he “found them all to be
failures,” and says:
On my return from London I was met by a
number of reporters who asked a series of ques-
tions. I informed them that there was no
nationalised health scheme in any country that
I had seen which could be taken as it stood
and applied in Australia. The geographical and
constitutional position in Australia is such that
a scheme which might be satisfactory in countries
like Great Britain, Sweden, France, Norway,
etc., where there is one central dominant Gov-
ernment, could not be used in a Federation such
as Australia. Our sparsely-scattered population,
together with the fact that there are six sovereign
States, makes it imperative that if Australia is
to have any form of national health scheme it
must evolve one to suit its own problems. You
will appreciate that this is quite different from
claiming that all schemes are failures.
Benes passed out in Prague without, so
far as is known, signing the new Com-
munist Constitution for Czechoslovakia.
The synthetic Republic, which cost
Europe a terrible price in blood and tears
and about which sentimental chaps
worked themselves into hysteria a few
years ago, is now nothing more than a
new part of the Russian hegemony.
Benes’s funeral might have been accom-
panied by riots, but the Communist-
run police called out a couple of thousand
“armed factory workers” to —er —keep
the peace. “Armed factory workers” is
what Australia would have got had it
fallen to the Communist-inspired notion
of creating a “people’s army” during the
war.
In divorce proceedings in Sydney last
week, one Walter Roth, who first shed the
light of his countenance on Australia in
1940, admitted that he had obtained land-
ing permits for 11 people and collected
£l3OO for doing it. Of this, he said, he
gave £650 to the Australian Jewish Wel-
fare Society Immigration Fund. Roth’s
wife alleged that diamond-smuggling
from Singapore provided the gentleman
with a little pocket-money, but this he
denied, saying he brought file gems with
him when he first came here.
While not in action some A.I.F. units
sported a “grouch-hour”—a set time when
any man with a reasonable complaint
could parade himself privately to the
C.O. If the soldier was not satisfied he
could, through military channels, go
higher, but couldn’t write direct to
a politician. Mr. Chambers, the
Army Minister, has other ideas. “As
far as I am personally concerned,” he
told a reporter, “there is nothing to pre-
vent a soldier from communicating with
me. I consider it is the soldier’s demo-
cratic right. I am not concerned about
the King’s military regulations. I am
myself a democrat.” Even the great I
Am should know that King’s Regs, have
some purpose. That purpose is disci-
pline, the oil on which the army runs, and
if watered down by misguided “demo-
crats”—or demagogues—could ruin the
whole machine. But then discipline, both
in civil and military affairs, is the first
casualty of Chifleyism.
Talk outside Brisbane Parliament
lobbies has it that Premier Hanlon’s visit
to England may take in more than the
Empire Parliamentary conference and end
in his resignation from politics to figure
somewhere in the management of the co.
which will mine Blair Athol coal. It
may be just gossip, but there’s a pre-
cedent in the case of Forgan Smith, now
head of Queensland Sugar Board.
“Dee” sees changes:
Redistribution, if it comes off, will see some
constituencies change out of political recog-
nition. Darling Downs, likely to be given away
by C.P.-leader Fadden in favor of a more com-
fortable seat, has been non-Labor since Federa-
tion, and was almost dedicated to the Groom
family—W. H. Groom was succeeded after the
first Parliament by Littleton Groom, who held
it over 30 years, with one break, until his death
in 1936, when Fadden inherited it. West Sydney,
to disappear, was W. M. Hughes’s from 1901 to
1917, then W. H. Lambert’s until 1925; he was
followed by Beasley, who stayed on until he
went to London. Bruce’s old seat, Flinders, has
been carved about, and Page’s Cowper, his since
1919, has been cut in half and centred more
completely around Grafton, Page’s old medical
stamping-ground. Chifley’s Macquarie seems to
have been made a safe Labor bet by the in-
clusion of Lithgow; previously it was a swinger.
Hume, which used to follow the main railway
south and gave Labor narrow wins because of
the-town vote, seems likely to revert to the C.P.
It was William Lyne’s old seat. Martin, once
H. E. Pratten’s blue-ribbon seat, has been
moved entirely south of the Parramatta River,
but without pleasing Daly, who finds some more
conservative territory included. North Sydney,
W.M.H.’s safe seat since 1922, has changed, and
Hughes is talking, at 84, of going after the
new Bradfield.
Cattlemen in the north aren’t waiting
for Ward’s grand new railways. The
other day a test shipment of 74 bullocks
from Anthony’s Lagoon went by diesel
road-train to Alice Springs, thence by
rail to Adelaide in eight days. It would
have taken them nine weeks to walk the
540 miles from the station to the Alice.
Meantime a lOOft.-long diesel road-train
is on the way from Melbourne to the
Alice by the order of a carrier there who
intends to use it to carry fat cattle from
outback to the railhead.
When the R.S.L. discovered that a
former Nazi publicist named Von
Skerst had been selected in the N.S.W.
“quiz” team for the current loan cam-
paign it raised sqch a howl of protest that
Mr. Chifley was constrained to announce
that Von Skerst had been scratched. But
who was silly enough to put him in the
stunt in the first place?
‘Julius, the Communist barrister who
was jailed with Englart and Healy for
non-payment of fines inflicted for taking
part in disturbances during the last
Queensland strike and released when a
mysterious hand dropped the money on
a Government desk, was mulcted
£7O in fines and costs by the Industrial
Court last week and sentenced to jail for
contempt. Later he apologised, the Court
refusing to accept the apology from his
fellow-Communist, solicitor F. Paterson,
on his behalf. The jail sentence was ex-
punged, but the fine stands and Julius
says he will appeal. What an ornament to
the Bar!
Hanlon survived a no-confidence
motion in Brisbane Parliament over the
repeal of the anti-picketing law and the
remission of fines on Communist law-
breakers. There were the usual “clashes”
and “uncomplimentary remarks,” and a
bit of dirty linen was dragged out here
and there, but nothing came of it
except expressions of annoyance from
the Country party that the Kewpies hadn t
consulted them about the motion.
Repeating the now familiar but none-
theless urgent warning that a steadily in-
creasing world population faced a steadily
increasing food shortage, Sir Henry
Tizard, president of the British Associa-
tion, asked “Is famine inevitable or will
science come to the rescue as it did
before?” When they hear about this the
Commonwealth food “heads” are ex-
pected to rush out and slap another
control on parsnips or something.
Richard Gardner Casey has announced
his intention to stand for the new Latrobe
seat in Melbourne, which should be a
sitter. W. M. Hughes and sundry other
aspirants for the new Bradfield seat on
the north side of Sydney Harbor will sleep
the sounder for the news —somebody had
talked about inviting Casey to Sydney.
The battle between the Sydney Labor
Government and Woollahra Council as
to whether a park should be sacrificed to
save Wren’s stadium from the Eastern
Suburbs railway was still raging at the
week-end. Woollahra would have got
plenty of support from Vaucluse if its
aldermen hadn’t been so dashed eager to
grab Vaucluse under the same Govern-
ment’s amalgamation-of-councils bill.
Holding forth about “Kingship and
kinship,” and averring that “Mr. Chifley
was continuing Mr. Curtin’s ‘settled’
policy” of consolidating and strengthen-
ing the British Commonwealth, the New
John Bull was heard in London last
week. Yes, Doc. Evatt—and ostensibly
“without inhibitions.”
The Miller and Peters victimisation
cases (B. 4/8/’4B) took a bad turn for the
Communist bosses of the Clerks, A.R.U.
and 8.W.1.U. in Melbourne on Sunday
when 2000 members of the three unions
agreed to fight Commo bullying and
purge the existing system of “ballots.”
They should have gone further and de-
manded the production of detailed union
balance-sheets.
Dispute between Dedman and Vic-
torian soldier-settlement authorities con-
tinues over what ought to be a fair valu-
ation —1942 values are suggested—for
soldiers’ farming blocks. Thanks to
Chifley’s inflation and the 40-hour week,
the cost of necessary improvements —
labor and materials —for these settlement
projects is now as serious a matter as
the cost of land. Chairman Simpson, of
the Victorian Soldier Settlement Commis-
sion, declares that limitation of land costs
is not enough. “The soldier’s prospects
of success,” he says, “will be ruined if
he is charged the full cost today of house,
sheds and fencing.”

100 YEARS BETTER
PERTONAL ITEMS
When a Bulletin man called to con-
vey the paper’s farewell to Albert Jan
Zylstra —until last week Netherlands Con-
sul-General — he met a genial-looking
diplomat who is cosmopolitan or no-
thing. Stationed in the West and East
Indies, and quite a few places in between,
he has travelled Australia considerably
more than most of us. Which may be
the reason he and Madame Zylstra don’t
want to leave it. An officer of the Royal
Netherlands Navy in 1921, Zylstra, took
degrees in economics and engineering at
Rotterdam Uni. before joining the staffs
of several trading companies operating
throughout Europe and the N.E.I. When
the Nazis reached Holland he and his wife
joined the resistance movement; what
happened there they both prefer not to
talk about. On the pleasanter subject of
holidays the Bulletin man, seconded by
Madame, advocated the Reef. The Consul,
after 15 years in the tropics, plumped for
Kosciusko. Among the friends who’ll
miss the couple is a lively Australian
kelpie, who, arriving uninvited a year
ago, has definite ideas about staying.
Engineer Rear-Admiral J. W. Wishart,
0.8. E., R.A.N., still retains that leanish
look which the enginerooms of most of
our major warships sweated into him.
Next week he leaves the engineer-man-
agership of Garden Island for the Naval
Board, of which he’s to be Third Member.
Educated in Suva and N.Z., he joined the
Service as a sub-lieutenant in 1915, and
as such was a minor cog in the engine-
room of old cruiser Sydney for most of
the first dust-up. It is generally accepted
among the Navy’s engineers that appoint-
ment young to Garden Island offers the
best chance of reaching the No. 1 job in
Navy Office. Wishart proves the belief-
after only eight years’ service he became
assistant to the dockyard engineer
manager. About the time Mussolini was
getting restless over Abyssinia, Wishart
was standing-by the building of our
second Sydney, and, on completion, he
brought her home through the Mediter-
ranean, after a brief spell there while the
position clarified. She visited Gallipoli
with H.M.A.S. Australia. The latter half
of last war he was Director of Engineer-
ing at Navy Office, and in 1945 toured
U.S. naval dockyards. The admiral was
responsible for the dockyard and all new
construction in N.S.W. Now he will
hold the baby for the entire Australian
squadron.
“Trinco”: With her mother. Queen
Juliana of the Netherlands slipped across
to England ahead of the Nazis in a British
destroyer. She has many of her mother’s
outward characteristics —the same serene
face and a graceful carriage which offsets
her slight plumpness. Like her mother,
she married a German prince, Bernhard
zu Lippe-Biesterfeld; unlike her, she
dresses fashionably and has none of the
frugality of speech her mother inherited
from her ancestor, William the Silent.
She possesses a remarkable memory for
names and personal details, which, added
to a natural wit, makes her an envied
hostess. One of the few reigning Queens,
she has three daughters to carry on the
line.
Figure for a tragedy:
A great dramatist of the future, pointing the
tragedy of this just-ended decade, could hardly
do better for Ids central character than use
Edouard Benes, dead in the Czechoslovakia
which he dedicated himself to liberating and
which his own struggle and good intentions suc-
ceeded in the end in shackling. Ten years ago
he was in exile in England: he had helped in
the founding of the Czech Republic; now,
like his country, he was a victim of Munich.
So, when the inevitable war came he welcomed
it, with all the optimism and overconfidence that
were the core of his nature. Thereafter all the
great figures of the day take the stage with him:
France’s leaders, opposing to the end the
recognition of him finally accorded try
Churchill when France and those leaders had
collapsed; Churchill himself restoring to Benes
his title of President; in America, Roosevelt’s
actions largely influenced by his acceptance
from no other than Benes of the belief that
Stalin’s word for anything could be regarded
as final and inviolable; and in the Kremlin
Stalin and his henchmen making their own plans
for Czechoslovakia—and for Benes. All through,
till he, like Roosevelt before him, was dis-
illusioned, he believed absolutely in the Kremlin
and Stalin as his country’s saviors. And all
his actions on that belief were so many ImKS
thus forged by himself for his country’s ultimate
and utter enslavement. He died a broken man
—a pathetic figure, lacking the desperate trait
that led Jan Masaryk to suicide. Perhaps a
flicker of the old optimism burned in him to
the end; the hope of a miracle to prove him
right after all—not, as he died, the most mis-
taken man of all in a tragedy of mistaken men.
It takes courage at any time to go to
the aid of a drowning man —his natural
tendency to grab the rescuer usually puts
them both in the same predicament.
When there’s a shark to contend with,
attempted rescue calls for guts of a high
order. In Sydney last week two young
men, Stanley Elford and Albert Linich
were awarded the Humane Society s gold
medal for rescuing shark victims. Elford
wrenched his brother from a shark s jaws
in the Maria River, near Port Macquarie,
and Linich performed the same office for
a boy attacked off a Newcastle beach.
Both victims died shortly after these
brave actions.
Holdens deserve, for their own sake
and Australia’s, a favorable reception of
their new car. The firm’s story matches
those of most of the country’s successful
businesses—a small beginning developed
by assiduous application of hard work,
native ingenuity and courage to overcome
vicissitudes. The Holden saddlery, begun
60 years ago in Adelaide by Henry Hol-
den, expanded into coach-building, and,
with son Edward returning to the business
with a science degree, took on motor-
bodies. With the firm mass-producing
in, for those days, a large plant at Wood-
ville, S.A., Edward bearded General
Motors executives in Cairo and came
away with their agreement to let Holdens
produce their Australian requirements.
The year was 1923, and the depression
live years later exercised Edward to the
utmost to keep the business working. He
did it by turning out fruit-cases, golf-
heads and filing cabinets. The slump was
weathered and General Motors and
Holden interests further cemented. When
Edward, now knighted, died last year
there were 10,000 names on the payroll.
A nephew of the third generation, J. R.
Holden, is now at the wheel.

for the rising of the curtain on “Aida” ;
among other hurdles overcome, he had
to fly his team, its luggage and a
few tons of props from Naples
to Port Said when the ship was unex-
pectedly diverted to Argentina. For all
his two decades of collecting and pouring
into this country half the world’s greatest
musical and theatrical celebrities, he re-
mains a very pleasant and understanding
person. His Westminster-like bearing
can possibly be attributed to the fact that
his mother as a girl lived opposite the old
Palace-yard and regularly attended all
Parliamentary functions ; Nevin himself,
during his 20 years in London, was no
stranger to Whitehall. A good Australian
and happy to be back, if only for a brief
visit, he spent his boyhood days in the
Castlemaine (Vic.) district, a stone’s throw
from where Mcßeath, who drew the
accompanying sketch, was born.
Roy Stapleton, Victoria’s new rent-
controller, knows a fair rent or two. He
was chairman of the Metropolitan Fair
Rents Board for seven years. He also
plays golf.
“Thap”: Chess champion Gregory
Koshnitsky called in at Bundaberg (Q.)
the other day, and in the usual one-
against-many game got a surprise when
forced to fight hard by one of the local
players, who demonstrated wrinkles of
the game not known to the average pawn-
pusher. The player was S. A. Gibson,
8.E.M., of the clan which founded and
still operates Bingera plantation and
sugar-mill, and well-known as “Weary”
Dunlop’s chief offsider in the Middle
East and behind bamboo. Towards the
end of the war he had as hut-mate in
Thailand one Oppenheimer, mathematics
man at Raffles College and a chess-player
of world-class. The master dictated over
300 games from memory, and gave
Gibson a grounding in the game to re-
member when Japs, malaria, beriberi and
bashings are forgotten.
The doctor who assisted at the first
breath of Bill Morris, the Richmond
(Vic.) footballer who won this year’s
Brownlow Medal for the best and fairest
player, asked his father to promise that
he would school him where Rugby was
played, not that “abomination of a game
called Australian Rules.” But Bill got
out of the parental orbit, transferred
from a N.S.W. bank to Tasmania, and
there he met the despised game. Ac-
quaintance developed to such good effect
that when he left Melbourne’s Scotch
College he was high in its Rules hier-
archy. He saw service with both the
Armored Division and the R.A.A.F. in
the last metee.
Two clerics in the hierarchy who have
recently resigned their offices as deans to
cathedral churches are Arthur Edward
Morris, dean of Newcastle, and John
Bell, dean of Armidale. The former was
head of the Bush Brotherhood at Charle-
ville (Q.) before coming to Newcastle.
After serving as a curate at St. Mary’s
Abbotts, London, he joined as a padre in
the first scrap, and came to Australia in
1923, A recent car accident put him out
of the running. Dean Bell is a Westralian
man who got his early experience at South
Perth and Claremont.
'“Ek Bum’s” assessment:
Dead at 72, Mahomed Ali Jinnah, first
Governor-General of the new Pakistan, and
almost solely the father of his country. Son
of a rich Karachi merchant, he was called to
the English Bar at Lincoln’s Inn and practised
for a time in England without embarrassment,
since his English was perfect in accent and
idiom and his mode of thought Aryan, like his
appearance, which was such as to make him
almost indistinguishable from the old-type, sun-
dried English-born I.C.S. senior. Marrying a
daughter of Sir Dinshaw Petit, a leading Parsee,
he became for a time private secretary to the
head of the great Bombay family of Dadabhoys
and settled down in their exclusive, immemorial
reserve on Malabar Hill, Bombay. He began
to practise at the Bombay Bar in 1906, and in
time became its richest ornament, his fees
sometimes passing the £25,000-a-year mark.
As president of the Moslem League he exerted
such an influence that nobody else in the League
counted for much, which was _ fortunate, since
he was a staunch friend of Britain, always tor
constitutional methods, but at the same time
loyal to the interests of Moslemism and the idea
of a separate Moslem State within the British
Commonwealth. To him, more than to any
other Indian, was due the settlement with the
British Government without rebellion or hos-
tilities in the sensitive Moslem areas.
A novel experiment is being tried by
Gerard Doube, a young St. Kilda artist,
who is heading for the Victorian hinter-
land in a caravan with his wife and a
travelling art-show. The idea is to
initiate miners, stockmen, boundary-
riders, fruit-pickers and other similar
parties into art appreciation—and into
painting, too, if they show the inclination.
Doube’s collection of 80 pictures includes
work by Max Meldrum, William Dargie,
Allan Sumner, James Quinn, Charles
Wheeler, Rupert Bunny and Tom
Roberts, and is valued at £2OOO. The
first stand will be the Geelong gallery,
where the Mayor will open the exhibi-
tion.
Another Australian doctor to attract
attention in England is R. A. Willis,
whose recent book. The Pathology of
Tumors , is being hailed as possibly the
most important work on the subject yet
printed on either side of the Atlantic.
An authority on cancer, he left Mel-
bourne, where he was pathologist at the
Alfred, for the professorship of pathology
at the Royal College of Surgeons; and
left there to take charge of the patho-
logical department of one of the largest
sick-bays in London. He was born at
Yarram (Vic.), is 50 and was educated at
Melbourne High, from which a scholar-
ship took him to Melb. University.
Into the silence:
In Adelaide, at 65, William Horace Yelland.
He joined the Adelaide “News” when it was
founded in 1923, and was editor when he left
it to buy the Port Pirie “Recorder.”
In Hobart, at 77, Vincent William Shoo-
bridge, hbpgrower and former member of Hobart
City Council and House of Assembly, and
Warden of New Norfolk. His grandfather
introduced hopgrowing into Tasmania in 1822.
At 92, in Melbourne, Lieut.-Colonel Jcpseph
Graham, believed to be the oldest Salvationist
in Australia. Joining the Corps in M.L. in
1883, he was a district commander over here
four years later. He retired in 1919 after
serving in all States. A son is a Salvationist
lieut.-colonel in Sydney.
In Adelaide, at 66, E. C. W. Martin, past-
president of the Master Builders’ Federation
of Australia, and vice-president of the Adult
Deaf and Dumb Society.
In London, at 42, Albert Sandler, one of the
8.8.C.’s best-liked regulars. Son of a Russian-
Jewish cobbler, he laid the groundwork of his
facility with the violin playing after school in
an East End cinema orchestra for five shillings
a week. Just before he died he was doing
a dozen programmes a week, and had recorded
innumerable light classics.
In Brisbane, at 67, Professor T. Parnell, an
eminent radio physicist. When General Mac-
Arthur made Brisbane his headquarters, effi-
cient radio communication was all-important.
This entailed a study of upper atmospheric
layers and the formation of a radio-sounding
station. Prof. Parnell did the job.
In Adelaide, at 74, Stirling Taylor. A
Broome pearler in the early days, he became
Westralian Farmefs’ first manager, and was
co-opted by the Government to direct the
Bureau of Commerce and Industry. He helped
to organise the Australian Wheat Pool.

“AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS”
“Zake”: The publicity campaign being
launched by Australia’s wine industry to
dissociate the hateful and harmful word
“plonk” from its products brought from
the inevitable daily columnist the supposi-
tion that “plonk” derived from the Digger
slang for the French vin blanc. The word
“plonk” was utterly unknown to the Old
Diggers. The vinegary white wine over
the absorption of which they shuddered
was invariably referred to as “point
blank” —and that was about the range.
Whether the “blank” was corrupted into
“plonk” after they got back home is
problematical but unlikely, for cheap
white wines in Australia are rare.

“Yipe”: Beaming, the face of my
neighbor showed up among my sun-
flowers and told me to come quickly,
as his baby daughter had just begun to
speak. The father explained that hearing
young children speak is very like boiling
a billy—they go off when you’re not
watching them —so we withdrew a few
paces from the pram, and he told the
whole story again. “I was scraping with
the mattock,” he said, “when I heard
someone say ‘dad-a.’ I couldn’t believe
it—she’s only six months,-you know —
but I went over and, sure enough, she
smiled at me and said it again. ‘Dad-a’
she said and recognised me. At six
months! Yes, there I was scraping with
the mattock” Here his wife inter-
rupted him with fitting words about its
being the crowning injustice to women:
“We, the poor mothers, go through all
the business of having them, rearing
them, and for thanks they start out by
ignoring us and speaking only to their
fathers. It isn’t fair!” Her husband
was just about to take over again when
his daughter found her tongue. We
crowded around the pram, and I have
never seen a smile leave a man’s face so
quickly. The word that sent him reeling
back to his bean-patch and left both
witnesses shaking helplessly was not
dad-a,” but “hadya.” (

Ray Whiting”: At “Pucka” Darkie
was always irt strife; six parades out of
10 found him missing, and his pay book
was a horrible sight. After arriving in
Palestine we lost sight of him until, months
later in Syria, a Wog in baggy breeches,
furry high hat and all slid alongside to
bite us for a quid. It was Darkie ; he’d
been a.w.l. for months, living in Tripoli
with a Syrian bint. He wore Wog’s togs
during the day, but donned his uniform
at night for the swy game at the
N.A.A.F.I. canteen. Suddenly Darkie
learnt that the whole Ninth Division had
vanished, and his girl-friend told him
what most of the Division itself didn’t
know; that it was on the way to Egypt
for an appointment with Rommel. That
decided Darkie, and when he’d finished
his arduous hitch-hike he found himself
back where he really wanted to be, with
the regiment at Alamein.

“Spokeshave”: When I read that a
Melbourne man who teaches French at
a technical school went to see “Les
Enfants du Paradis” and didn’t under-
stand a word that was spoken I was
reminded of an Australian artist who pre-
pared himself for his art studies in Paris
by learning the language from gramo-
phone records. He acquired an accent
which a Frenchwoman assured him was
perfect Parisian and a couple of dozen
idiomatic sentences. When he tried him-
self out in Paris even his landlady re-
fused to believe he was an Australian.
She took him for a mad Frenchman.

“Bo”: The pathetic attempts by some
of the “great dailies” to disguise the fact
that the majority of their comic-strips—
some are dignified by the title “picture-
stories”—are American pulp-syndication
stuff sometimes achieve weird results.
Change is effected only in the letterpress,
a common device being to alter “bucks”
and “cents” into shillings and pence—this
although the character in the strip may
be a “drug-store” soda-jerk (unknown in
Australia) and his customer wearing a
donkey’s-breakfast hat, which is as about
as indigenous to the present Australian
scene as a Randwick bookie carrying an
alpenstock or smoking a hookah. But
the ultimate in fatuity was reached when
one strip tough jerked out of the slit at the
side of his mouth to his blonde girl-friend:
“My Word, you've been a long time at the photographer's !”
“Sure, babe, the D.A.’s grilling ‘Butch’
—so what? We got the two thousand,
ain’t we?” The “two thousand”
was in slightly different printing. Any
guy willin’ to risk two bucks that, before
this “disguise” was effected, the amount
read “two ‘grand’ ”?

“Loc”: At Wormley (Eng.), someone
dug up £lO4 in silver and a wad of notes
amounting to £3OO from his garden. He
put the matter to the coroner, who found
the silver to be “treasure trove,” and
the notes “lost property,” Apart from
the wonder I get that anyone finding
such rich humus in his spud-patch should
disseminate the glad tidings, I have been
puzzled by the essential difference, other
than 200 quid, between “treasure trove”
and “lost property.” While awaiting en-
lightenment from a legal mind, my own
theory is that notes, being numbered,
could be recognised as old friends, while
coins, unless badly bitten, have to go
through life as welcome strangers.
* * * *
“Clooter”: I see by the papers that
liquor reform is about to burst out again,
the General Synod of the Anglicans hav-
ing announced a programme, and the
Brisbane Catholic leader. Dr. J. V.
Duhig, who is also president of a Liquor
Reform Society, having welcomed it. As
far as I can recollect, booze has been a
target for reformers all my life, and the
result seems to be, as far as Sydney is
concerned, that it is a darned sight worse
than ever. Nobody denies that our drink-
ing habits, the conduct and customs of
hotels, the State Liquor Act and Bung
himself all need disinfection and repair,
and though I’ve no doubt of the earnest-
ness of these churchmen, I can’t help re-
flecting that the hand of the wowser is as
responsible for the rotten state of the
drink business as anything else. The
peculiar thing is that the drinkers them-
selves are more aware of the need for
reform than anyone, but nobody has
yet thought of inviting them to ap-
point delegates to any of these liquor
conferences. On the day that we drinkers
are invited to these reform seances re-
form will really be on the way.

“P.K.N.”: Some short time ago old
police records in the Mt. Gambier district
were being destroyed and some were
found to bear the signature A. L. Gordon.
An admirer of the poet asked later what
had happened to the relics, and was told
“They went into the fire, too. To us, he
was just another copper.” This hap-
pened in a district where tourists
are shown the Bellum Bellum hotel
and told that it is built on an old cor-
roboree-ground and that the name is abo
for “War War”!

“Woodenit”: A painting contractor has
been supervising the building of his new
home near my place, and it is just about
finished. “When are you going to shift
in?” I asked him the other day. He
looked worried. “I don’t know ” he said.
“There’s a hold-up with the plumbers.
You can’t hustle them,” he commented in
disgust. Then he added, “And there’s
another hold-up. I’ve so many other jobs
on, I don’t know when I’ll be able to
spare any painters.”
* * * *
“Craiser”: Animal memorials (B.
1/9/’48)? A Toorak woman returned
from a holiday and found her husband
had forgotten to feed her parrot; it was
stone-dead. She insisted that the cadaver
be taken to a taxidermist, and the couple
set off with the deceased wrapped in
brown paper. Diverted by a display of
the latest fashions, the lady insisted on
entering a department store, and the hus-
band, fed-up with being a hearse, stuffed
the noisome bird into a vase on a counter.
An attendant saw his action and called
the manager. The scene that ensued
threatened to culminate in a fit of
hysterics on the part of the bereaved bird-
lover ; so, to get himself out of an awk-
ward situation, the husband bought the
vase with the carcass jammed in it. Suit-
ably inscribed, the vase now reposes on
the dining-room mantelpiece with the bird
embalmed in wax inside, a perpetual
reminder to the husband of his lack of
consideration for his spouse’s injured
feelings.

“Omega”: After cruiser Canberra had
sunk the German supply-ship Coburg
(B. 14/7/’4B) we pulled near the aban-
doned tanker Ketty Brovig. A boarding-
party found the ship had all her scuttle-
clips burned, thus preventing the sealing
of her portholes. Her machinery was
wrecked, and as the tanker couldn’t
be saved Canberra’s 4in. guns finished
her off at dusk. One of the boarding-
party got a foot caught under a bulkhead-
door and couldn’t remove it. He undid
his shoe, withdrew his foot and the boot
went down with the ship. Later in
March Canberra’s “duck” flew over the
spot where the tanker was last seen, and
amidst a sea of oil the vessel was dis-
cernible on the shallow ocean bed —on
the Saya de Malha Bank.

“Caesar’s Ghost”; The horse also has
been responsible for some stage mishaps
(B. 25/8/’4B). Those who were on the
stage or in the theatre on the night when
a member of the “Desert Song” cast
dropped the point of her spear under-
neath the tail of the white horse on which
the Red Shadow was posturing will never
forget the result. Even the members of
the orchestra were scared out of their
places. My own personal experience was
when we co-opted a threadbare hack
named Seabreeze to enact the winner of
the Derby when we were playing “The
Flying Scud” at Westport (M.L.), Un-
fortunately, everybody knew the nag,
and when, after a well-built-up race scene.
the victorious “Flying Scud” was
brought on to receive the plaudits the
universal whisper in the packed house of
“Seabreeze” rather spoilt the effect. Then
there was the bus-horse that was the
only equine a minor London theatre
could borrow to act the “untamed fiery
steed” in a Mazeppa act. The ropes usee
to control it made a fair disguise of i
tameness as the audacious youth wa
bound to its back, but when the bindin
was completed not even carrots dangle
offstage could induce the “fiery untamec ”
to make a move. A resourceful stag
hand remembered that the borrowe
steed was normally a bus-horse;
banged a batten on the floor to Simula
the slamming of a door and criec
“Right!” Hearing its accustomed signa
to move, the untamed fiery bus-hors
moved offstage with its burden.

“Minto”: Some years ago an Au
tralian became the centre of interest i
his home town because he played in “Th
Good Earth,” though he modestly ac-
mitted that his part was only that o :
head locust in the plague scene. Apa
of mine now finds himself similarly em
barrassed because he spent a few minute
on the set of the Olivier film “Dem
Paradise.” In an agony of embarrass
ment he explains all to his hero
worshippers. “In the opening scene four
men walk out of the room with thei
backs to the camera. I’m one of th
backs.”

“X.S.”: Another perfect crime wen
west in Melbourne when a gang of fiv
purloined 300 pennies from a produce
store at Burnley. The only clue woulc
have been the fact that the lock of th
door could not have been manipulatec
from outside except by a small hand, bu
one of the miscreants succumbed to th
psychological impulse of advertising hi
bad conscience by scribbling his nam
on a piece of office paper. This led to
the capture of the gang —small boy
whose ages ranged from five to eight.

The phrase “As little damage
as may be” sounds as ambiguous as they
make ’em, and it raised the ire of
Liberal member in the Victorian
Assembly when it cropped up in a bil
authorising the Railways Commissioners
to enter on private land in Gippsland. He
quoted it asi an example of the “in
describable and incomprehensible
language” Parliamentary bills are usually
cast in. Actually, it is hoary with lega!
precedent, and dates back to some of the
earliest acts in the English canon mean-
ing “as little damage as possible.” That
of course, doesn’t make it less ambiguous
than the speeches of most Ms.P.

“T.McN.”: Everyone in our tram com-
partment was impressed by the tall
slightly - greying, distinguished - looking
fellow in the tasteful grey suit when he
came aboard. His polka-dotted bow-tie
offset the pearl-grey shirt and the hand-
kerchief hanging negligently from his
breast pocket. The sparkling snap-brim
hat had an air of elegance and youthful
maturity about it, and the handsome
leather valise on his knees bespoke a man
of importance, probably privy to the
councils of the great. We lowered our
voices in deference to him and felt some
little honor in that he had deigned to
share a public conveyance. He looked
through the window at the passing scene
with a detached air, as though seeing life
with a mixture of boredom and
philosophy. Then he thrust a rigid index-
finger far into his left nostril, bored
vigorously, inspected what he had re-
trieved and rubbed the finger along the
tram wall. Some passengers thought the
sound of the exploding illusion was a
short-circuit or something.

“Mullum”: Another good argument
gone west. Remember the hours we spent
in camp arguing about what would
happen if a man, having served a jail
sentence for murder, was released to find
that his “victim” was still alive, and
promptly killed him? Cables lately re-
ported such an incident in Egypt —the
Court tried the murderer again, sentenced
him to the same term of imprisonment
and immediately released him as he had
already served it. The only argument now
to be settled is: In which hotel did the
reporter hear the story?
♦ * * ♦
“Noonamah”: The Royal Inniskilling
Fusiliers, the old 27th Regiment, now
engaged in suppressing Communist-
directed disorders in Malaya, claims an
honor unique in the history of British
arms. In 1798, in action against the
French in St. Lucia, West Indies, the
regiment so impressed Sir John Moore—
best remembered for his fighting retreat
and death at Corunna —with its gallantry
that he granted it the honor of flying its
regimental flag over captured Fort
Charlotte for an hour before the British
colors were hoisted.
FRENCH POLITICS.
“Whenever a political crisis occurs or impends in
the French Chamber of Deputies the din is deafen-
ing. Members stamp noisily on the floor, pound and
bang their desks and yell insults at one another.”
— Cable.
They beat all rivals, Gallic politicians,
As now and then a cable column tells,
For violent gestures, savage ebullitions
Of quenchless rage and contumelious yells.
They lack, poor chaps, for all their cultured
notions
And attributes of elegance and grace,
The habiti of controlling strong emotions
Inherent in our Anglo-Saxon race.
With parties—Heaven only knows how many! —
Sparring for dominance, on office bent,
It would be strange if there were ever any
Prospect of firm and stable government.
Premiers follow Premiers, their beginnings
Foredoomed with endings just as swift to
close,
Each barely having time to start his innings
Before incontinently out he goes.
Now courting one another, now estranging,
These various factions do their stuff in
France,
Now picking partners, next abruptly changing
The same, as happens in a giddy dance.
With handicaps like these to labor under,
A Ministry that lasts six months or so
Becomes an object for respectful wonder
In the bright lexicon of Jean Crapaud.
A Parliamentary crisis once a quarter
Or thereabouts is pretty sure to come,
Affording the Parisian reporter
A front-seat view of Pandemonium.
Men curse and yell and on conventions trample
With which they cannot fail to be acquaint,
Setting their countrymen a poor example
Of the requirements of polite restraint.
But stay! I seem to hear you asking, brother,
If I have never watched in troublous years
Our local Solons slating one another
With shouted insults and opprobrious jeers?.
Too right, I have. But in their aberrations
From strict decorum and their worst
burlesques
Of what should be mature deliberations
They have one point to show the Latin nations:
You never see them pound and bang their
desks,

T. THE R.


“Dong”: With protective varnish dull-
ing its nickel-work, traces of sticky saw-
dust around the tyres and its headlights
swathed in wrapping-paper, the newly-
arrived British car was parked down near
Sydney’s wharves. Despite the technical
mothballs it bore, the car had lines sleek
enough to draw a crowd, and then held
them with a cryptic message on the wind-
screen. “No Water” it said in scarlet
letters. It would have been less startling
to see “No Money” painted up outside
one’s favorite bank. To a lady who
inquired openly what it meant, various
interpreters stepped forward. One, a
man with a hook in his belt and a bulge
in his cheek, solemnly declared that the
tramp steamer it had come out on had
gone dry just off the Lizards, and, crazed
by the time they reached the tropics, the
crew had gone around writing it on
everything. The lady sniffed at him. She
accepted, however, the explanation of a
bright young chap who said it was a new
kind of car with the notice advertising
the fact that its motor was air-cooled.
When the owner turned up with a silly
story that no car was sent here with water
in its radiator, and that the notice was
to remind people to put some in before
they drove it, the lady displayed the con-
tempt it deserved and went to look at
the seagulls.

“K.”: It is surely about time the Army
authorities allowed Frank Weaver, late
of the 8.C.0.F., to remain in Japan with
his Japanese wife, since he is clearly of
that mind, however “mentally unstable”
he may seem to theirs. For a third time
this year, having been deported from
Japan by the Army, love has laughed at
all provost-corps locksmiths ; each time
he has “skipped custody,” purloined
Army forms, it is said, or “hitchhiked
by air” without them, and flown back
like a homing pigeon to his Japanese
consort. Why should he be pushed
around by the Army any more? In what
does this denial of conjugal rights to
Weaver differ from the soviet’s refusal
to allow out of Russia the Russian wives
of certain British soldiers? If joining
the Socialists’ new volunteer army means
this sort of conscription, no wonder en-
listments are lagging.

“M. 8”: Touching the tragedy of the
lost air-liner Lutana, whose wreckage,
with 13 dead, was found on a mountain-
side of the N.S.W. Liverpool Range, near
Quirindi, I’m wondering what secret the
sea holds off Newcastle. There, during
the search for the missing plane, “three
large oil patches,” one of them nearly a
mile long, were seen on the waters, and
at first supposed to have come from the
Lutana. They didn’t, as it turned out,
but where did they come from?

“Ike Holler”: St. Mark’s, Darling
Point, the church with the sweet chimes
which ring out over Sydney’s southern
harbor-frontages on Sundays and special
occasions, has just had its centenary. When
built it was the parish church of Cook’s
River, which extended from South Head
to Port Hacking; the first rectors used
to visit the outlying parts of this jurisdic-
tion by horse and sulky. It became St.
Mark’s, of Darling Point, when what
had been scattered settlements in a
wide stretch of native bush had grown
sufficiently to have churches of their own.
The church school, whose pupils auto-
matically became choir-boys, has turned
out many leading citizens. The most
hectic period of the church’s history oc-
curred in the late ’9os—when the intro-
duction of the “confessional” brought
threats of actual violence. The con-
fessional was dropped. The church, pic-
turesquely placed in the leafage of the
trees which are abundant enough on “the
Point,” is another of early architect
Edmund Blacket’s works. He copied the
design of the Holy Trinity in Horncastle,
Lincolnshire. A connection between the
Australian and English parishes has been
maintained.

“Ekko Vita”; Purring manfully in the

of rawhide on the floor under the steer-

was attached to a small ring-bolt and
gave it an experimental tug. An eldritch
screech shattered the silence of the lane,
heads popped from windows, a lorry-
driver’s hair stood on end. Yes, it was

careless in this matter. In my youth what
was really a tin-shed answered the pur-
pose of the morgue; the papers used to
“You get a LOVELY view from here.”
report gravely that an inquest was to be
held at Lloyd’s Hotel, George-street
North. Nobody thought it incongruous
to hold an inquest in a pub. Artist Fred
Brown was proud possessor of a large
table which came from Lloyd’s Hotel.
He refused to have the circular marks on
the top removed, maintaining that they
marked the place where witnesses in
many a good murder or suicide case had
rested their mugs of beer while waiting
to be called. He liked to think, also, that
on crowded occasions when the tin-shed
morgue had been overfull a cadaver or
so was laid out on this bit of mahogany.

“Lyle”: A “village of history” such
as “W.F.G.” would like to see established
in Australia (B. 11/8/’4B) has been a
reality in Sweden since 1891. It
is situated on Djurgarden, one of
Stockholm’s largest islands, and a popular
pleasure resort since the 17th century,
There are lovely drives and walks along
the shore, and a fine park, in the heart
of which Skansen, the village, stands.
Many buildings, each representing a
Swedish province or historical period,
have been re-erected there and appropri-
ately furnished. There is a whole street of
old Stockholm, and also preserved are
specimens of old tools and early
machinery and examples of ancient
costume arid peasant-craftwork.

“L.P.”: We were rattling along in an
old T-model Ford. My mate, a careful
driver, slackened down at the bad bend
leading into the town. - An old joker in
a spanking new limousine took further
precautions by pulling over on to the
grass and giving us all the road. It was at
the police-court, where we had a little
business to transact, that we next clapped
eyes on him. He gave us an ugly look
and made his way into the house of
justice. A copper appeared, took our
number and told us we were up for
dangerous driving. “You forced another
car off the road back at the curve,” he
said. “Ridiculous,” my mate argued.
“Tell the old fool he doesn’t know the
rules of the road. Who is the old joker,
anyway?” “The police magistrate,”
grinned the cop.
“Tos”: “HA.L.’s” * Stetson (B.
25/8/’4B) reminds me of my uncle —Tom
Smith, hatter, of South Melbourne
(M.L.A. for Emerald Hill and Port Mel-
bourne), who taught Sammy Mauger his
trade. Tom was a big noise at Collins-
street Baptist Church, and as Mayor of
Port and South Melbourne and M.L.A.
he attended functions. Except
when custom required him to sport a top-
hat, he always wore a hat which he
bought for Is. in a secondhand shop.
His skill at his trade enabled him to make
it look like new, and he had it in constant
use for over 10 years. It was a Borsalino,
a high-class Italian type.
• * * ♦
“C. 8.”: A proverbially lazy man,
Rossini either mislaid or never wrote an
overture for the “Barber of Seville” (B.
8/9/’4B). Rather than go to the
trouble of writing another, he lifted one
from an earlier work which had no more
to do with the business of the “Barber”
than the trio sung by Rosina, Almaviva
and Bartolo in the music-lesson scene in
the second act. In that scene the com-
poser let the prima donna sing anything
that came into her head, and prima
donnas have been doing it ever since.
Patti sang songs from operas by Auber,
Meyerbeer and even Verdi; Melba used
to favor the mad scene from “Lucia”
and Tosti’s “Mattinata.” Galli-Curci
tried everything from “The Last Rose of
Summer” to “Home Sweet Home,” ac-
companying herself at the piano.
* * * ♦
“Kelms”: A chap fined for drunken
driving in a Westralian country town
must have reckoned he was stiff when the
Crown appealed against the sentence and
secured a suspension of licence. In the
West the law jumps on drunken driving
with both feet; the Judge held that the
magistrates were obliged to inflict the
heavier punishment. Anyone who thinks
the law is harsh can take a walk along
almost any major highway in W.A. and
see a white cross painted by the Safety
council to mark the spot where a fatal
accident has occurred.
« * * *
“Flip”: To save that overpowering
tedium which afflicts noughts-and-crosses
addicts when they have to draw four lin.
lines to start each new game, there is
now on the market an “everlasting set,”
consisting of a plastic board and plastic
pieces, all advertised in plastic language
as “Norts and Crosses.”
* * * *
“Young Slim”: The native brew
“kava” must rank high in intoxicant
circles. When on minesweeping duties
up north we called at Darnley Island for
a night, and the islanders put on a turn
for our benefit. While a dance was in
progress the chief approached Blue and
me and offered us a drink —about two
thimblefuls in a cup. Down it went.
When the smoke cleared away we asked
for more, but chiefie refused with a
polite smile. He must have known some-
thing: Within 10 minutes we were in
the middle of 'the mob making more
noise than all the boongs put together.
* * * *
“P.0.M.C.”: True, the sudden cessa-
tion of regular or accepted sounds will
disturb sleep (B. 11/8/’4B). So, too, will
sharp variation in tempo or volume. While
pumping in Rothbury colliery (N.S.W.) it
was my practice to start the pumps on
No. 2 and No. 3 levels on my way down
the tunnel, sleep the shift away in a bunk
near the pump at No. 4 and stop them on
my way out. The rattling rhythm of the
machine became a lullaby, but let a scrap
of coal be sucked up from the sump and
temporarily unseat a valve to cause one
of the plungers to “miss” a few strokes
and I awakened instantly.
* * * *
“H.D.P.”: Funerals (B. 28/7/’48)?
Over a period of years a family con-
tributed weekly payments for a “lay-by”
funeral for Mum. The final payment
was at last paid, and the family congratu-
lated itself. When Mum heard of It,
although a little “pipped,” she decided to
hold her peace. The day came when
Mum passed on, and the family realised
she had had the last word —she left her
body for scientific research, with instruc-
tions that no funeral rites be performed.

• “A.L.A.” (Fiji): Although the Fijian
is traditionally regarded as improvident,
he may, at times, take precautions that
would not occur to most of us. An in-
stance of this was revealed when
a court official inquired into the origin
of a quarrel. When statements were
taken each of the witnesses regarded the
crucial point in the crescendo of tempers
as the moment when, in preparation for a
fight. Brown Brother looked around for
a safe place in which to deposit his den-
tures,

“W.P.T.”: The Explorers’ Tree at
Katoomba (N.S.W.) is to be preserved
with a colorless dekol fluid. This is the
stump of a tree marked by Blaxland,
Lawson and Wentworth on their crossing
of the Blue Mountains. Right at the side
of the Great Western Highway, it is one
of the best-known landmarks on the Blue
Mountains. Not so well known is the
little convict cemetery on the hill behind
the marked tree. Here, marked by a few
mounds of rough stones, are the graves
of 16 convicts who died during the build-
ing of the road over the mountains.
* * * *
“X.S.”: Police in Sydney and Mel-
bourne have been searching for a tall,
handsome, distinguished-looking man
known as “The Toff,” alleged to have
made thousands of pounds out of a hous-
ing-racket. He approaches a prospect with
an offer to obtain him a flat or rooms for
a consideration which runs from anything
up to 300 guineas, according to circum-
stances. He then takes his quarry to view
a flat, having previously told the occu-
pants that he has a client with a better
flat who wishes to swop. If this one is
agreeable he then proceeds to a third
victim and tells him the same story. Even-
tually there may be a chain of families
expectantly preparing to step into the next
one’s shoes. The suave entrepreneur then
removes himself to another suburb.
NUMBER ONE.
When Parliamentary seats are readjusted,
Old boundaries deleted or obscured,
There’ll always be a lot of chaps disgusted
And others gratified and reassured.
The gauge employed in all such circumstances
For whether well or ill the job is done
Is how it suits their own prospective chances
Of re-election, fits their tastes and fancies,
Affects the interests of Number One.
The bird who sees a squad of-leal electors
Torn from the stamping-ground he’s served
so well
And dumped abruptly among neighboring
sectors
Inevitably gives an anguished yell,
While he who’s feared next polling-time to
waken
And find his course in Parliament has run,
Noting new boundaries have saved his bacon,
Finds nought but merit in a scheme that’s taken
An advantageous turn for Number One.
Some whose electorates are “on the border”
And find new-scheduled seats not far away
Looking as if expressly made to order
For candidates as slick and spry as they
Are loud in welcoming redistribution.
But, still and all, its fate depends, my son,
Whether this periodic institution
Means the augmenting or the diminution,
The drab retardment or the bright solution
Of problems pertinent to Number One.

The Government, continuing to make
banking a political football, has decided
to appeal to the Privy Council against
the High Court’s judgment which de-
clared invalid vital sections of the Bank-
ing Act, 1947. This attempt to reassemble
the now ramshackle machinery of a piece
of socialistic legislation intended to give
the Government a financial stranglehold
upon every section of the community is
in keeping with the inveterate stubborn-
ness and blindness to public remonstrance
of the Treasurer. Meanwhile the trading
banks have adopted a rational, progres-
sive and co-operative policy, declared aim
of which is, in co-operation with the
central bank, to develop even wider and
better banking service.
Their activities are already restrictively
circumscribed by the 1945 Banking Act.
From the investment angle this Act pro-
vides for control of bank earnings, and
therefore distributions, though no specific
limit is placed upon the rate of dividend
that can be paid. From the economic
aspect it is a powerful instrument for
Government direction of trade and other
activity. It gives the Government power,
through the Commonwealth Bank, to
control the volume, nature and direction
of trading-bank advances, the proportion
of their deposits to be lodged on special
account with the Commonwealth Bank,
the rate of interest they can charge for
loans and pay on deposits, and the volume
of their investments in Government and
other securities. And in all these matters
directives have been issued by the Com-
monwealth Bank.
Section 48 of the 1945 Act was chal-
lenged before the High Court and de-
clared invalid. And many doubt the
validity of other sections of this Act
which might yet be challenged before the
Court.
Banking today, as indicated by the level
of advances and deposits and the nature
of bank assets, especially liquid?, reflects
the effects not only of the 1945 legisla-
tion just referred to, but also of war and
post-war inflationary pressures. These
include Government spending, pressure
of accumulated purchasing-power, strong
demand and scarcity of supplies, large net
exports at high prices, overfull employ-
ment, wage lifts, reduction of working
hours, restriction of output and rising
prices. It has all led to liquidity in trade
and industry and economy in the use of
bank funds.
The danger is, as the governor of the
Commonwealth Bank pointed out last
week, that present inflationary tendencies
will be strengthened if crucial bottlenecks
are not speedily broken. First and fore-
most of these is coal, and then output
per man-hour throughout the whole ambit
of trade and industry. High prices and
scarcities obscure many economic and
other dangers ; but the wise trader will
lose no time in underpinning the financial
structure of his undertaking against the
day when the economic machine gets into
reverse gear.
Compared with 1939, deposits in the
C.B.S. at end June last had more than
doubled, while advances were 4.6 p.c.
lower and liquids nearly four times
greater:—

Last term’s growth of £10,706,304 in de-
posits was accompanied- by an expansion
of £6,081,610 in liquids and of only
£4,818,517 in advances. When the books
closed the co. had £35,400,000 on special
account with the Commonwealth
Bank, £7,000,000 in Treasury Bills and
£19,285,996 in Government securities, a
total of £61,685,995, or £21,514,269 more
than was advanced to trade and industry.
However, owing to the large increase in
the volume of low-interest-bearing liquids,
net earnings from all sources are now
slightly better than in 1939. Last term’s
£402,771 (up £9478) of profit was 4.3 p.c.
on shareholders’ funds (capital and re-
serves combined) as against 4.1 p.c. in
1939. It is a trifling improvement, woe-
fully out of keeping with the fall in the.
value of money and far behind the
advance in earnings of traders generally.
On capital alone the year’s profit was
8.5 p.c,, and half a point was added to
the div., making it p.c., the final being
at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a.
At £24 ss. the £25 shares paid to
£l2 10s. each (the other half is a reserve
liability callable only if required on
liquidation) return 4.1 p.c. on an 8 p.c.
div, basis. Net tangible cover (book-
value) is £24 ss.

The co. provides the women of the Com-
monwealth and its neighboring Dominion
with most of their foundation garments,
and its alert management has made the
most of opportunities that war and post-
war conditions have created for this class
of business. For just on a decade the
co. has enjoyed the overflowing order-
book that goes with a seller’s market
Three factories set up since the war at
Wollongong, Lithgow and Punchbowl
(N.S.W.), to help overcome the labor
problem, are giving a good account of
themselves. And so are the three associ-
ated cos. —Berlei (N.Z.), Ltd., Berlei
(U.K.), Ltd., and Warners Le Gant Pty.,
Ltd. The N.Z. offshoot is a steady \l\
p.c. proposition; the other two, over
whose figures the curtain is drawn, are
reported good profit-earners with ex-
panding turnovers. Berlei Pty., Ltd., has
ceased to operate, the parent having taken
over distribution of its own products in
Victoria and Tasmania.
To help finance expansion of its own
activities, the parent gathered £49,937 of
fresh ord. capital at a premium of 100
p.c. and called the remaining 10s. on
51,000 ords., making them paid to £1
each, early in the 1947 term. And msl
before the close of last accounts 53,200
new ords. were offered and snapped, one
for four, at a premium of 225. 6d. each.
That lifted paid capital at end June to
£309,319 in 50,000 8 p.c. prefs. and
266,250 ords. —there was £6931 still to
come in. The share-premium money
(£59,906) was added to reserves, which
also benefited by £1829 previously over-
provided for taxation and by £40,814
from a revaluation of investments. All
shares held in other cos. “are still con-
servatively valued.”
The £49,214 (up £14,262) of profit was
written after allowing for depreciation
and taxation and deducting staff profit-
sharing divs. (£4423). It was enough to
pay the pref. div. and show 21 p.c. on
average ord. capital as against 18.9, 27.6,
24.5, 18.4, 15 and 16.7 p.c. back to 1942.
The div. was kept at 10 p.c., at which
level it has remained for the last 13 years.
After sending £3709 to the staff fund, 40.7
p.c. of the year’s net earnings remained
in the business, lifting reserves £9494 in
excess of paid capital. And provided
wage and other costs over which manage-
ment has no control don’t get out of
hand, the co. promises to give a good
account of itself in an unrestricted
market, where quality, style, fit and price
will be determining factors in sales.
At 525. 6d. the ords. return 3.8 p.c
on a 10 p.c. div. basis, or 4.5 p.c. should
the distribution be lifted to 12 p.c., which
has been more than earned for each of
the last seven years. Net tangible cover
is £l2 16s. lOd. prefs. and 445. sd. ords.

Next after the big C.S.R., this co.’s scrip
is the most popular on the list in the sugar
group. The f.-p. pound shares, visibly
covered by 375. in net tangibles, are
priced at 565. 6d. (535. 3d. a year ago),
giving a return of 3.9 p.c, on an 11 p.c.
div. basis.
Milling, both on its own and growers’
account, is the backbone of earnings,
which are stiffened by returns from a fine
wad of investments outside the business
and by moderate pickings from refining
the small portion of the Queensland crop
not handled by C.S.R. The investments,
which total £74,429 more than paid capi-
tal, consist of Government securities
(£509,102), shares in the Bundaberg Dis-
tillery (in the books at £64,951, or
60 p.c. of face-value, and worth a lot
more than that) and a handful of shares
in other cos. (£376). The board’s laconic
comment on the distillery is that it “con-
tinues to do well, though its income was
curtailed through lack of shipping space.”
Drought—one of the most severe ex-
perienced in the Queensland sugar belt —
and damaging winter frosts played havoc
with earnings in 1947. Nature was kind
last term, when the co. put 215,000 tons
of cane through the rollers as against
72,000 tons the year before. There was
a corresponding rise in the output of
raws, and the export price went up from
£A2S to £A29 a ton. Outturn of the
refinery, which was called upon to relieve
the sugar shortage in the southern States,
“substantially” increased. After allowing
an unspecified amount for taxation and
£16,295 (down £399) for depreciation,
the leap in net earnings was £60,860,
raising the figure to £84,844, compared
with an average of £63,280, or 12.6 p.c.
on capital, for the eight years to end
June, 1946. The £84,844 of profit, best
yet, was 16.9 p.c. on capital as against

1943. The div., of which 4 p.c. is labelled

year in succession. And a residue of
£33,985 from internal reserves, set aside

As for the outlook, another gooc
season is in prospect. And, to help re
lieve the pressure of advancing costs, |d
a pound was added to the retail pric
of fines, making it 4|d. again as from
Dec. 3 last —it was the first rise in th**
Australian price of fines since 1920. I
means an increase of £4 13s. 4d. (to £42
a ton, of which 10s. Bd. goes to the grocer
Is. Bd. to the wholesaler, and the other
£4 Is. to miller and grower; but a Gov
ernment freight subsidy of 10s. a tdh
has been withdrawn, leaving £3 11s
net, which is equal to £3 7s. per ton ol:
raws. Also, the Imperial preference on
sugar has been extended for a period oi;
four years—it is worth about £A3 15s
a ton of raws to Australian growers—
and the labor position has improved a
little, owing to employment of Balt
migrants. The brake on net earnings is
the steeply rising cost of labor, fuel
freight, jute, refining, transport, farm im-
plements and fertiliser. And the storage
problem, aggravated by the slow turn-
round of ships in northern ports, threatens
to become acute.
The already comfortable financial posi-
tion further improved:

These outlays were met partly

Profit was greatly helped by
the removal of War-time (Co.)

to be brought from tax-provision
into reserves. As a proportion
of gross profit, general expenses
represented 54 p.c. las % t term,
compared with 60 p.c. in 1947 ;
but the chairman emphasises that
gross itself has fallen as a pro-
portion of turnover. Present
earnings are the result of heavy
sales, which may “fluctuate much
more quickly than expenses.”
Taking into account the com-
fortable margin between recent
profits and distributions, the
great strengthening of the co.’s
finances and the steps being
taken towards further expansion,
the market prices the £1 ords.

The Price of Tin
An old friend of The Bulle-
tin, with a very wide experience
in tin production, writes:
Even allowing for inflation, which,
in the absence of another global war,
deflation might do a lot to correct be-
fore the world is much older, the pre-
sent price of tin in London and Mew
York appears to be at a dangerously
high level. Recent London and New
York quotes for the metal were
£SSI9 a ton and 103 cents a pound
respectively. The equivalent of these
figures in Australian currency at pre-
sent rates of exchanges is £648 15s.
and £714 6s. respectively. In Aus-
tralia the price is fixed by the Gov-
ernment through the Prices Commis-
sioner at £A555 buying and £A62O
selling, delivered Sydney. The buying
price is equal to Ills, per unit; that
is for 70 p.c. concentrates or better,
with penalties for lower grades.
The decision of B.H.P. to set up a
big tinplate-mill at Port Kembla, on
the N. S. Wales south coast, stresses
the need for establishment of a sound
and expanding tinmining industry in
Australia. This can be achieved if
producers, smelters, consumers and
the appropriate Government authori-
ties get together and fix an Australian
price for the metal at an economic
level for a suitable period, say, three
years, with a guaranteed minimum
price for a following period.
Many producers consider that 100 s.
a unit would be a satisfactory figure
under existing conditions, with a
minimum of 85s. for the second
period. Small producers—a ton or
under annually—and producers who
did not clear a fixed amount per ton
of concentrate produced could be
dealt with on a basis similar to that
on which gold-producers were treated
in respect of the now-defunct gold
tax.
A time-and-price guarantee along
the lines suggested would stimulate
production by providing producers
with an opportunity for long-term
planning, and would do much to lift
the level of local production to the
level of local consumption or there-
abouts. It would also do much to
mitigate the effects of severe price
fluctuations overseas upon local pro-
duction. The collapse of tin prices in
the early 1930’s killed many promis-
ing tin propositions and put others in
a position from which they have not
yet recovered.
Mt. Coolon (Q.) continues to
hold on in the hope of a worth-
while prospect turning up. At
end December last the co. (paid
capital £300,000 in 10s, shares)
had £16,458 in the bank, and
held 102,100 f.-p. 4s. shares in
Monjing Star (Vic.) and 90,000
3s. "shares paid to 9d. each in
Atlas Gold (Q.). Divs. from
Morning Star enabled a profit of
£9879 to be shown for the year,
and 6d. a share is to go out on
Sept. 29, making total distribu-
tions to date £465,000, or 15s. 6d.
a share. Mining ceased in 1939,
when the ore-body gave out

GOLD MINES OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED
Extracts from the Address of the Chairman, Sir Walter Massy-Greene,
delivered at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Gold Mines
of Australia Limited, held at Melbourne on Wednesday, nth August, 1948-
After dealing with the operations of the Company the
Chairman said. It is only right that I should point out
that the gold-mining industry, unlike any other type of
mining, is, barring the cancellation of the gold tax (which did
not assist the then marginal producer at all as he did not pay
the tax), carrying on with a constantly diminishing net return
as costs continue to rise. The sterling and Australian com-
parative prices are as follows: —
f' —London Prices N , —Australian Prices—
In Sterling. In £A.

Gold, an oz. 715 2 812 3 913 11 10 15 3
Of these, varying proportions of lead and zinc are exported
and exports are being sold at sterling prices or at still higher
dolla'r prices. Silver is being sold at world prices. Prices of
tin and copper have been fixed at something less than world
prices, but at prices greatly in excess of pre-war prices. It
is evident that no common principle has been applied in fixing
these prices in Australia and that the decisions have been
purely arbitrary.
GOLD PRICE LAGS BEHIND PAPER MONEY
In comparison with the rise in world prices, or what has
been done by the Prices Commissioner for other metals to
meet rising costs, the price of gold compares most unfavour-
ably and lags far behind the general increase of prices in
paper money in Australia.
Meanwhile the basic wage has risen in Victoria from
£3/19/- to £5/17/-, and, in addition, the lowest paid em-
ployee in the industry receives a further 16/- per week in
allowances and . margins, i.e., an increase of 68% on 1939
figures. The costs of all supplies, such as oil, fuel and other
consumable stores, spare parts of machinery or new installa-
tions, have risen about 100% and in some cases the rise has
even been greater.
When I addressed you last year I pointed out what had
happened after the first world war, due to war finance; the
fall in the value of money, with rising prices; and the effect
all this had upon the gold-mining industry, bringing it almost
to the point of extinction; and I predicted that sooner or later
the price of gold must be once more raised. I am still of
that opinion, though the reasons why it should be done are
becoming more and more urgent as the margin between what it
costs to produce gold and the price received in paper currency
becomes smaller and smaller. I think it must be clear to the
meanest intelligence that we have not seen the end of the
rise in costs, and that Government “promises to pay’’ are daily
losing some further part of their purchasing power.
INFLATION HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE
We are constantly being warned about the danger of in-
flation, as if the rise in costs were the cause of inflation,
whereas it is the result. Inflation has already taken place
by the enormous increase in the volume of Government
“promises to pay’’ in currencies and various forms of securi-
ties. Had this been balanced by a similar increase in national
wealth and/or the means to create it, we would not be hear-
ing about the pressure of purchasing power on too few goods.
But in the main there is no corresponding creation of national
wealth, and the extent to which these vast increases in Gov-
ernment “promises to pay” in paper fall short of the creation
of new national wealth is the measure of inflation that has
taken place.
This is the basic cause of rising prices and in large
measure, owing to the war and the measures taken to finance
it, is inevitable. Moreover, owing to the magnitude of the
war, the phenomenon of rising prices is common to all the
world and every economy. What is more, sooner or later every
economy must be brought into relative relationship one with
the other. Try as we may, if we are to trade on a world-wide
basis we cannot cut ourselves off from world-wide economic
trends without throwing our own economy out of balance, not
only with the world, but, also, internally. It is true, of
course, that with the aid of Government subsidies and various
forms of Government control, the full effects of the in-
flationary consequences of war finance, the effects of inflation
can be temporarily camouflaged, minimised and delayed, but
they |annot in the long run be avoided.
Various expedients have been resorted to in Australia
through Government agencies to delay inflationary effects,
perhaps hoping to avoid them. Most, if not all, of these
expedients aim at maintaining money values entirely regard-
less of human values which should be sacred to us all.
Owing, however, to the lack of a master plan—if such be
possible—the Australian economy is fast getting into an
almost inextricable tangle and becoming a thing of shreds and
patches, leading to the creation of all sorts of stresses and in-
equalities for which there cannot be any logical justification.
Some industries are enjoying the full effects of rise in world
prices both on the local and export markets; some have a low
local price and a different and higher export price; some a
price which is purely arbitrary; and some exhibit every con-
ceivable variation, even as between producers in the same
industry.
In all this there is no logical basis of governing principle,
but the most illogical of all the controls is that which compels
every producer of gold to sell his product to the Government,
through the Commonwealth Bank, at a price which in a
world of universally rising prices takes no account whatever
of the rising cost of production. This, perhaps, is a necessary
corollary of the adherence of Australia —a gold producer to
the International Monetary Fund, but I believe it to be entirely
unrealistic and it has some very serious consequences.
As our geological knowledge of the deposition of Australia’s
gold resources increases the more certain it becomes that
there are still vast undiscovered and untouched deposits
which may exceed by many times the gold already won in
this country, but which can only be uncovered by patient
and persistent exploration at depth. With gold at present
prices and costs at existing levels this can never take place
and the future of the gold industry is therefore circumscribed.
ACADEMICALLY-MINDED ADVISERS
I may be forgiven for expressing doubts as to whether
the Government powers that be and their academically-minded
advisers have ever studied what gold has meant and still means
to Australia. Does it ever strike them when they talk so
glibly about the uselessness of gold and the foolishness of
keeping its production going and their refusal to help it that
it is to the gold industry alone that Australia owes the great
surges of migration, which gave Australia the population she
lias to-day? A new and important gold discovery in Aus-
tralia, such as a Kalgoorlie or even a Bendigo, would set on
foot yet another flood of migration.
I fervently believe such discoveries can be made. They
can only be made if the industry is maintained on a reason-
ably prosperous scale. To do that it must get a fair deal.
Bluntly, it is not getting one now.
The low price of gold is having an immediate result in
reducing the quantity of gold-bearing ore that it is profitable
to work in existing mines, and in some cases compelling either
selective mining or the complete cessation of operations. In
1939 Australia’s gold output was 1,615,697 fine ounces valued
at £A15,956,398. In 1947, the last year for which we have
complete statistics, the output amounted to 937,654 fine
ounces, valued at £10,091,501. We have already lost a
100% annual source of dollars to the extent of $18,750,000.
It is certain that the 1948 figures will reveal a further fall
in production.
Our ability to earn dollars might very easily have been
increased by a similar amount to that by which it has been
decreased, if not more, had the Government begun to realise the
importance to Australia of maintaining and increasing the pro-
duction of gold in Australia.
IMPORTANT REASON FOR HIGHER PRODUCTION
However, there is a wider and still more important reason
why the production of gold should be increased.
To-day it is an offence in Australia, and, save in France,
over most of what we are wont to call the Western World
to own gold or to sell it at other than the fixed price, and
the only ultimate purchaser must be the Government. This
price was virtually fixed before the war, before the vast increase
in Government promises to pay, which have had the result of
radically altering their value when translated into the goods
which the paper tokens will purchase. The interchangeability
of gold and paper is not free. It is fixed, and fixed at a level
which has no relation whatever to, and, in fact, ignores the vast
economic changes which the war has caused.
Gold-mining is suffering a grievous wrong and is compelled
to accept payment over vast areas in a fixed number of paper
currencv tokens which are constantly depreciating in value.
Were gold merely a commodity which, because of its rarity,
beauty and durability, was turned to various uses, perhaps,
outside of the gold-miner, few would complain. But gold has,
by tliG common assent of mankind from time immemorial, a use
as a measure of currency values.
I venture to say that the world-wide faith in the inherent
value of gold is as strong to-day in the minds of men as it
ever was. It is the only basis by which the relative value
of currencies can conveniently be measured, and, in fact, is
being measured. To-day the measurement is largely arbitrary
and quite unrealistic, because of the artificial conditions broug it
about by various Governments consequent upon the inflationary
issues of credit and currency; whilst gold is not allowed to
provide that discipline in government financial controls which
it is so adequately fitted to perform. As a consequence I think
there never was a time during the long ages of man s history
when that deep-rooted faith in gold was more securely en-
throned nor, perhaps, was there ever a time when it was more
necessary that gold should be permitted to perform its age-long
function of checking inflationary tendencies.
plea for a free market
This is not a plea for a rigid gold standard, but it is a
plea for what, for a time, would amount to a free market
for gold. I can conceive of nothing which would more readily
reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the world’s monetary
systems expose their unrealities and pretences, and after the
first shock—in many quarters it would be a shock—set the
the larger loser. Sooner or later, I repeat, the present fixed
price of gold would go by the board there is no doubt.
The gold-mining industry is losing to-day, but the world is
the larger loser. Sooner or later, I repeat, the present fixed
price for gold must be abandoned in favour of a higher figure,
and I hope, a free market. I believe that to be necessary for
the world’s monetary health and in that faith we can persevere.

Spending £435 Million
Though he is now reduced to
pleading with trade-unionists for
greater production of essential
goods and services, and specifi-
cally mentioned coal, iron and
steel in his Budget speech, at the
same time stressing the danger to
our economy represented by
rising costs, Mr. Chifley con-
tinues to produce inflated
Budgets that drain the country
of manpower, money-value and
production incentives.
During the year that closed on
June 30 Mr. Chifley budgeted
for a deficit of £3O million.
After spending £2B million more
than forecast, a revenue £59 mil-
lion greater than estimated pro-
duced a surplus of £1,400,000.
The national income expanded
£276 million during the finan-
cial year 1947-48, and the Can-
berra rake-off grew in propor-
tion. Almost under economic
compulsion Mr. Chifley revealed
a surplus for the period, but he
kept it down to the most modest
proportions by making extra
allocations for “social security”
and the like.
For the present financial
period Mr. Chifley, after provid-
ing reductions in taxation that
are expected to “cost” £2O mil-
lion for the year, nevertheless
budgets for a gross tax revenue
£l7 million greater than last
year ; but, with the cost of sub-
sidies cut by £25 million (follow-
ing the transfer of price-control
to the States), anticipates he will
have to borrow £17,7 million
to pay his way. It is a shocking
revelation of socialistic extrava-
gance.
Total expenditure is estimated
at £435 million for the present
year (excluding £22 million
transferred to war-gratuity re-
serve), an increase of £24 mil-
lion in spite of the fact that the
people will now have to pay con-
siderably increased prices for
clothing and food as a result of
the cutting-out of many subsi-
dies.
Here is a summary of the
Budget figures; with compari-
sons :

t After allowing for reimbursements
to States—l 946-47, £39.5 million,
1947-48, £44.6 million, 1948-49,
est. £53.4 million,
“Defence” expenditure this
year is estimated at £199 mil-
lion; but this includes £22
million put to a “war-gratuity”
reserve, £l7 million of which
was transferred from the war-
risk insurance surplus and £5
million from revenue; £1,400,000
will be added from last year’s
Budget surplus. Taking this
“reserve” out and excluding the
£lO million grant to the United
Kingdom, “defence” appropria-
tions of £167 million are down
£l3 million compared with last
year’s.
Principal reason for this, apart
from cuts of £14.7 million in
services expenditure (£50.5 mil-
lion), was a reduction of £24.7
million in the sum allocated to
price-control subsidies (now
£10.3 million) and no necessity to
make a further contribution to
the International Monetary
Fund (£10.2 million last year).
Credits from disposals, etc, (£ll
million), are £28.6 million lower
in this year’s estimates.
The Canberra “defence” ac-
count, it is obvious, is a strange
collection of miscellaneous ex-
penses and credits that disguise
the real cost of Socialist civil
government.
Interest on the 1939-45 war
debt, included in the defence
account, is reckoned at £49.8
million for the current year, up
£1.6 million.
Among items of civil outgo,
the National Welfare Fund now
swallows the largest amount of
taxpayers’ money. This year it
is to be allocated £92 million, a
rise of £27 million in two years.
Expenditure from the fund is
estimated at £88.5 million, a rise
of nearly £2O million compared
with last year. The rise is
largely the result of increases in
pension rates (up ss. a week, to
425. 6d.) and child endowment
(2s. 6d., to 10s.).
Administrative costs this year
are forecast at £27 million,
against £25.6 million last year
and £15.5 million in 1946-47.
Capital works and services
charged to revenue under general
headings are in at £24.2 million
for 1948-49, against £15.6 mil-
lion ; and the P.M.G. will spend
£10.5 million out of revenue for
capital purposes. Only the
oceans of tax-money received by
the Government permit this
opulent practice.
State tax reimbursements will
be £53.4 million, compared with
£44.6 million last year, and
State grants £24.5 million,
against £22 million.
Allowing for tax reimburse-
ments, Federal taxation revenue
for 1948-49 is estimated at £387
million —£7 million higher than
in the past year, all tax “con-
cessions” notwithstanding. The
gross income-tax yield is ex-
pected to be £J3 million higher
at £246 million, of which in-
crease the States will get about
£8 million. “Total revenue per
head of population” will be
£65 7s. 10d., against £6O 19s. sd.
last year.
Despite an all-time record
revenue, and the taking of £l7
million out of trust funds to
establish the war-gratuity re-
serve, Mr, Chifley - budgets for
a deficit of £17.7 million this
year. This is all the result of
ever - increasing Canberra
socialistic expenditure that has a
cumulatively adverse effect upon
the country’s industrial produc-
tivity.
Though war in the Pacific has
now been over for three years,
Mr. Chifley will, on his own
estimates, during 1948-49 extract
from the pockets of the Aus-
tralian people a greater taxation
revenue than at any time in this
country’s history, war-time or in
peace. It is highly likely that
his estimates this year will be
exceeded by actual collections —
that he will have more money
to spend than he at present
reckons on, and that he will have
to think of new avenues of ex-
penditure before June 30 next.
It is not good for a “Labor”
politician of the Socialist brand
to have such a huge amount of
the people’s money at his dis-
posal, especially during the last
financial year before the elec-
tions. Mr. Chifley has shown,
by his banking legislation and
his attitude to the industrial
breakdown that has developed
during his term of leadership in
the country, that he is neither
economically nor industrially
trustworthy. He is fundamen-
tally a Socialist politician, and
he seems to have put his socialis-
tic aims before anything else.
Taxation and Inflation
The Government expenditure
for which the country pays to-
day, coupled with the production
depression that has been de-
liberately fostered by the Com-
munists—Mr. Chifley’s “philoso-
phers”—has produced a danger-
ous inflation, of which Mr.
“Appendix be damned — that's my finger you've got
hold of”
Chifley says he is aware, but
which, as the country’s Govern-
mental leader, he does little to
combat. He has spoken of his
heavy taxation programme as
being a counter to inflation ; but
taxes are not anti-inflationary
unless they are used to reduce
u “ e of money m c.rcula-
lion or reduce the national debt.
It is clear that last year Mr.
Chifley kept his Budget surplus
down to the smallest possible
proportions, and his increases in
pensions and the like during the
current period show that he is
in no way inclined to u§e his
huge tax revenue in a manner
best calculated to overcome in-
flation. The Prime Minister
doesn’t practise, as Treasurer,
the economic policy which he
preaches to the people.
The Canberra “Labor” Gov-
ernment goes on adding to its
payroll of unproductive civil ser-
vants. They now number nearly
three times as many as before
the war—a fact which must be
recognised when Mr. Chifley
tells us that “civil employment
has increased by 100,000, and
is now 640,000 above the figure
in July, 1939.”
With the operation of the 40-
hour week cutting production
down by more than the 3 p.c. to
5 p >c . anticipated, with wages
rising, with Communist restric-
tjon o£ coal and Bteel out ,
and with the Federal Gov ' rn .
nf
mntu9ng an in^ ated volume of
man P OW f as well as money for
hon-productive purposes, con-
sV,mer demand has grown out of
ad proportion to the present pro-
Activity of the country. When
Sir Otto Niemeyer came to Aus-
tralia during the depression he
told this country that it was “off
Budget equilibrium.” Well, to-
day, by reason of crippling tax
levies and an inflated “national
income,” this country is closer to
Budget equilibrium, but is dan-
gerously off production equi-
librium. In other words, we are
in a production depression—a
tragedy which can be largely
blamed on Chifley overtaxing
and overspending, and Chifley
appeasement of the industrially
lawless of all varieties.

When Sister Sue found her tube of Napro Hair
Vitalizer squeezed dry, she just took one look at brother
Bob’, lustrous, health'y hair and picked the culprit.

Hair Vitalizer gave him a healthy scalp, remove
dandruff and made his hair elastic and vigorous. But
he’s got no excuse for "borrowing” it again, because
now there is a special Napro Hair Vitalizer for men
that has ell the qualities of the original product and,
at the same time, keeps the hair perfectly groomed
without "plastering.” So just slip into any good chemist
or store and buy a tube to-day—it will improve your
hair from the very first application.
LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
Angry August
Britons will not soon forget
August, which showed in its be-
havior all the characteristics of
the man of uncontrollable pas-
sion. It came in beaming, on
the eve of a public holiday, and
gave promise of tempering a
stifling heatwave. On the last
day of the holiday it changed
mood violently, lashing pic-
nickers and returning holiday-
makers with drenching rain.
Between rages the periods of
quiet could be enjoyed only
under the threat of sullen,
brooding cloud. Gales and
torrential rains brought floods
and havoc. Towards the end of
its lease —when the chief vic-
tim, the harvest, was near to
disaster —the angry month re-
strained its violence and, as in
contrition, strove to make
amends.
With petrol-rationing and con-
gested trains and coaches, Lon-
doners are more than ever de-
tached from the countryside.
Few large cities have so gener-
ous a spread of open spaces for
the enjoyment of their citizens,
but the scenery is urban rather
than rural. If, when the towns-
man reads of the harvest, he
comes across terms which are
beyond his understanding—such
as “eye-spot,” “take-all” and
“sprouting in the stock” —at
least he is relieved to know that
the prospects of a good yield are
better than they were, and that
the losses may be no more than
10 per cent.
Nearly every city-dweller has
an admiring envy of the ancient
craft of the countryman. He is
comforted to learn that, though
heavy rains may have flattened
crops, thus defeating up-to-date
machinery, individual skill in
the use of scythe and sickle will
effectively, if expensively, save
much that would otherwise have
been lost.
Holidays
According to a recent survey
of 1946 and 1947, only one-half
of the people of Great Britain
spent their holidays away from
home during those years. It
would seem that fewer still have
gone away in 1948, Central
London is crowded daily with
sightseers whose accents are
markedly local.
While Oxford-street is the
most congested thoroughfare,
the big stores do not report a
rush to spend money. Gros-
venor-square, near by, but not
easy for the stranger to find, is
sought by many who wish to
view for the first time the
Roosevelt memorial. Of the
new attractions, by far the most
popular is the recently-in-
augurated service of river-buses,
which ply between Putney and
Greenwich.
The general feeling among
those, who have spent their holi-
days away is one of disappoint-
ment. The weather has been
bad, and there has been little to
compensate for it. Mainly be-
cause of business calls and
hotel - reservation difficulties,
there has been poor response to
the appeal for holiday-makers
to travel in the middle of the
week. As a result, week-end
trains out and home have been
packed; and queues have been
early and long. Food seems to
have been better than last year,
but cigarettes, newspapers and
magazines are scarce and fre-
quently unobtainable.
Largely because of recent
legislation fixing minimum
wages, hotel prices are higher;
and, since nationalisation, rail-
way fares have risen. By com-
parison, road travel is cheap, but
can be enjoyed only by those
who had the foresight to think
of it last February—when sum-
mer bookings to the principal
resorts were sold out within a
few days.
It is surely a symptom of the
times that Britons have wanted
to leave behind them not only
their cares but also, for a brief
two weeks or less, their own
country. The most popular
choices have been the Isle of
Wight and the Channel Isles.
Perhaps the mind finds a tonic
in stepping on board ship and
sailing away, even if only across
the Solent.
Tobacco
Weekly consumption of
cigarettes now amounts to 1600
millions, compared to. 1450 mil-
lions before the war. A packet
of 20, which cost Is, in 1939,
now costs 3s. 6d. —as much as
the weekly meat ration for 3j
people. The difference may
well be accounted for by the
fact that more and more women
are smoking: and it is fair to
say that few men begrudge
them what comfort they may de-
rive. Men know whose task has
been harder, more nerve-wrack-
ing and, in many cases, more
dangerous.
Once begun, smoking is hard
to break off. It is also, at cur-
rent prices, an insidious inflator.
The frequently heard “What
pleasure can a man have with
fags at 2d. each and beer at
Is. sd. a pint?” is merely an in-
direct way of asking for higher
wages.
The shortage will continue —
there has been a further cut of
5 per cent, in supplies —and will
also aggravate the craving.
More men are following the ex-
ample of Sir Alexander Max-
well, tobacco-adviser to the
Board of Trade, in changing
over to pipe-smoking. But
cigarettes will still be out of
sight.
What is the solution? It can-
not be more dollars. A broad
appeal to the populace to smoke
one cigarette less in 10 is vain.
Perhaps an all-out recovery
drive, properly conducted, to-
wards ultimately paying our
way? Meanwhile, as minds
wonder and tongues wag, hands
subconsciously feel in the pocket
for that packet of cigarettes . . .
Unwritten Words
When Don Bradman’s 40th
birthday coincided with his last
appearance at Lord’s —and that
a century-making one —it is sad
to reflect that British news-
papers were able to find space
for only a scant announcement.
Indeed, this memorable and —to
Australians —most successful of
tours must have been less
adequately served by the written
word than any other. What
might have been recorded in
other days can only be left to
conjecture.
It is sufficient here to state
that everybody who has ever
watched cricket has tried to see
the Team of all the Talents at
least once ; that all —the confi-
dent, the hopeful and the non-
committal —were finally reduced
to a common denominator,
which might conveniently be
described as “what-is-wrong-
with-English-cricket?”
Television has, for the first
tipie, brought the devastation of
fast bowling and the study of
stroke-play into the very home.
Proof has been given that men
under 30 —and one under 20 —
can be fully-matured cricketers.
In homes and works, in
offices and pubs, in leader-
columns and, without doubt, in
St. Marylebone, men talk of
concrete wickets and listen
eagerly to accounts of how.their
game of cricket is; fostered and
played in a country where it
did not originate. Which is only
irrevocably to confirm that the
initiative has passed from the
green fields of England to the
matting - covered practice
wickets of Australia.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"LOVE FOR LOVE."
The Oliviers have left their
mark on Sydney. Richard
Meikle, who plays Tattle in May
Hollinworth’s production of
“Love for Love” at the. Metr-
opolitan, talks like Peter Cushing
and walks like Dan Cunning-
ham. Somebody else wears a
false nose. And there are times
when the whole company, as in
the Old Vic.’s “School for
Scandal,” whizzesi round the
stage in circles.
For all that, «it is a produc-
tion done for the love of “Love
for Love” ; and a lovely show
it is. There is a spontaneity
about it, a lively portrayal of
lively characters, that reminds
one that the Little Theatres, be-
cause the players put their hearts
into the business, can sometimes
outdo even professionals of the
standing of the Oliviers.
May Hollinworth put on a
“Country Wife” not long ago
that had moments of more
warmth and richness than the
Old Vic.’s “School for Scandal”
because her Betty Lucas was
more vividly in character than
Vivien Leigh’s frigid Lady
Teazle; and the Metropolitan’s
“Hamlet,” whatever it may have
lacked in polish, had an anima-
tion missing in Olivier’s film,
partly because May Hollinworth
did not abolish the stirring Nor-
wegians, partly because Kenneth
Pawley, playing a Hamlet en-
raged at his inability to rouse
himself to action, portrayed the
character with more fire, more
meaning and more consistency
than there is in Olivier’s strange
mixture of gymnastics and the
(Edipus-complex.
“Love for Love” is a more
immediately delightful play for
contemporary audiences than
either “The Country Wife” or
“School for Scandal.” It came
between the two in time, and it
has the virtues of both, the
weaknesses of neither: being
witty where Wycherley is crude,
direct where Sheridan is airy.
Though the plot is more or less
the same concoction of scandal
and confusion, the spark-
ling dialogue speaks directly to
the audience and the interwoven
satire on astrology has as much
force today as when it was writ-
ten. Congreve’s borrowings
from “Hamlet” are doubtless
reprehensible; but they serve,
because of the Olivier film, to
make it all the more topical.
James Workman and Lionel
Bain stood out among the per-
formers because they had rich
characters (Sir Sampson Legend
and his Jack Tar son) to portray,
and played them with astonish-
ing insight and vigor. Frank
Waters, Ozzie Conroy, David
Cahill, Mr. Meik 1 e , Lola
Sweeney, Lynne Murphy, Gwen
Harrison and Betty Lucas (the

"R.U.R."
Doris Fitton’s admirable pro-
duction of Capek’s “R.U.R.” at
the Independent Theatre, North
Sydney, is worth seeing for a
dozen reasons —for the play, the
acting, culture, support of the
people who, by the selection of
good plays and the sincerity of
their work, are helping to keep
the stage alive. And, above all
other considerations, there is the
simple and sufficient reason that
the production is highly enter-
taining—a full house showed
every sign of immense and unin-
hibited enjoyment last Saturday
night.
Leonard Thiele as the general-
manager of Rossum’s Universal
Robots was inclined to bellow
too much in the last act when
the robots take over from man-
kind and obliterate the human
race, although, no doubt, the
g.-m. of a concern which had
produced sufficient near-human
slaves to do all the labor and
fight all the wars of the world
would be inclined to bellow
with some anguish at the pros-
pect of being destroyed by them.
Generally, and despite his final
roarings, Thiele’s was a thorough
and sincere performance. Elaine
Montgomerie looked and acted
the part of his pretty young
wife, who comes first to plead on
behalf of the robots and remains
to fear them. James Pratt,
Allan Gifford, Leigh O’Malley
and Charles Tasman were con-
vincing and efficient as the
efficient human crew engaged in
turning out a steady stream of
robots.
The robots and robotesses —
Shirley Falconer, Walter Hill,
Michael Barnes, Bruce Francis,
Diana Davidson and Kenneth
Cobert—were excellently sus-
tained on a half-human plane,
particularly by Barnes in his
scene with Elaine Montgomerie,
where the robot’s soulless
body is being disturbed and
fired by the realisation of his
own power and by the ambition
to take over the running of the
world from man. It was some-
thing awful and tortured and
menacing at the same time, like
the birth of a monster. That is
as it should be, and in a few
moments of excellent acting
Barnes stated the whole play.
The final scene, in which the
robots destroy the last of the
humans, was a little too like a
war-dance. Cold, emotionless
killing would have been more
chilling and effective than all the
fire and frenzy, despite the sul-
phurous fumes which floated
through the audience from the
explosions and clatterings and
stamping offstage as the human
race put up its last desperate
fight against its own creations.
Still, despite such minor faults,
it is an excellent production
—entertaining, humorous and
provoking in both its obvious
and allegorical meanings—and
merits a long run.
Extremes in Art.
Francis Lymburner’s oils at
Sydney Macquarie Galleries and
Norma Bull’s watercolors at
David Jones’s are separated by
more than a couple of blocks of
city buildings: they are a world
apart.
This is not merely because the
artists have worked in different
countries ; for Miss Bull, though
most of her work is located in
London, has some Australian
scenes; and Lymburner, though
living in Australia, could just as
well have worked in London or
on the moon.
The artists approach their
work from opposite viewpoints.
They are both, if work only
mildly effective can justify the
term, extremists'. Miss Bull goes
in for hard, cold, architectural
drawings; Lymburner for
vague masses of color out of
which dim forms emerge, as
soft as putty.
Painting from his imagina-
tion, Lymburner is full of
sound and fury, signifying very
little; painting the reality of
bombed London, Miss Bull is
lacking in sound and fury, and,
regarded from the artistic rather
than the historical viewpoint
(the work is well enough as a
record of fact), her skies signify,
chiefly, that the barrage-balloons
looked like sausages.
The extremes meet, oddly, in
a certain childishness. Miss
Bull’s watercolor portraits and
figure-groups are as a child
would paint them: a child who
had learned to draw. Lym-
burner’s circus lion, fantastic
and ludicrous in its cage, is
again like the work of a child:
but a child who had refused to
learn to draw.
Between the two extremes you
pay your money—anything from
45 to 100 guineas for Miss
Bull’s paintings —and you take
your choice. Miss Bull’s
paintings, though “Black Rock,
Melbourne” has a luminosity to
offset the rawness of the current
English watercolor style, and
though some of her smallland-
scapes and etchings are attrac-
tive, give the impression of a
slight talent carried to its limit;
whereas Lymburner, when he
has a childishly-drawn lady
sitting to dinner with what is
either the devil in a red cloak or
a gigantic tomcat, seems to
promise that he will yet have
something dramatic to say.
Miklos Gafni.
The phenomenon of the
young Hungarian tenor, out
here again for a short tour, is
still his .ability to turn an even
fuller volume in the head regis-
ter when by all the rules of the
game he should be reaching the
point of breath-exhaustion.
Since he was last here a year
ago, Gafni has almost mastered
the most difficult phase of the
robust tenor’s art: the half-voice
on the high note. The songs he
chose last week at his Sydney
Town Hall recital also repre-
sent an Advance in taste. His
interpretation of such early
Italian masters as Monteverdi
left nothing to be desired.
Hephzibah Menuhin.
The Brahrfts F Minor Piano
Quintet, one of the few great
works in chamber music, was
the chief offering of the Musica
Viva concert at Sydney Town
Hall. Hephzibah Menuhin’s
sensitive and intelligent playing
was always transparently clear
as the piano was woven through
the fine texture of the string pat-
tern. It was excellent concerted
playing, with Robert Pikler
(violin), Theo Salzman (’cello),
Richard Goldner (viola), Edward
Cockman (second violin). In the
Beethoven “Archduke” Trio the
pianist was associated with the
violinist and the ’cellist. The
opening had patches of unsure-
ness, but the trio quickly settled
down to give an ebullient read-
ing.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Interest in grand opera is becoming
more fervent as the season progresses.
Those well-loved lyrical treatises on
jealousy, “Cavalleria Rusticana” and
“Pagliacci,” formed the latest programme
offering. In the latter a young Mel-
bourne girl, Halinka de Tarczynska,
sang the role of Nedda with great suc T
cess. Looking on from a box were four
beautiful French mannequins, superbly
gowned. Mrs. C. Curtain wore an ankle-
length gown of gold crepe romaine, the
skirt draped on harem lines; over it she
wore a white-fox cape. Mrs. R. Joseph
was accompanied by Mrs. Norman
Lynch, both wearing beautiful fur
wraps. Ruth Tait wore white taffetas
striped in blue and silver. Her aunt,
Mrs. A. H. Scott, was in deep mauve,
the gown being lent greater distinction
by the sequins in a deeper shade with
which it was sprinkled. Pat McKee’s
blue-net gown wasi embroidered in spld
flowers; her wrap was white fox. With
her was Eileen Griffin, whose silver-fox
cape covered a white bouffant taffeta
frock. Lillian Wightman’s slim-fitting
gown was of black wool; the bodice was
off the shoulder and edged with black
Persian lamb; the sleeves were long and
tight-fitting, the skirt draped to the back
to form a slight bustle. Mrs'. D. Stewart’s
grey-chiffon gown was worn with a blue-
fox cape stole. Mrs. Hylton Dale’s gown
was of raisin-toned velvet. Mrs. Beryl
Hadley’s gown of turquoise-blue crepe
romaine was trimmed with, gold sequins.
Mrs. Ken Myer’s bouffant black-chiffon
gown was highlighted with cream lace.
Mrs. D. Triaca chose pastel-blue tulle
embroidered in an all-over pattern of
white flowers.
There were posies of spring flowers on
the tables and massed foliage in the foyer
of St. Kilda Town Hall for the annual
ball of the Gloucester auxiliary of Prince
Henry’s Hospital. This was the twelfth
ball arranged by the committee, and all
proceeds go to the children’s' ward. Main
interest of the evening was the presenta-
tion of 12 debutantes to Sir George and
iLady Knox. The debs, carried posies tied
with the Gloucester colors of royal blue
and red. Kathleen Lascelles, who is
organising secretary of the auxiliary, re-
ceived the official guests, among whom
were the president of the hospital, W. H.
Roddick, Miss A. H. Morgan, matron of
Prince Henry, and Mrs. A. A. Lord.
Betty Harte wore a striped taffeta gown.
Pamela Middleton’s taffetas were pale
pink. Busy at the lucky wheel were
Clarissa Starey in black taffetas and
Robin Hill in pastel-blue taffetas.
Judith, elder daughter of Judge and
Mrs. F. B. Gamble, has announced her
engagement to Ewan, younger son of
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Deane. Judith is
doing dental science, and will sit for her
finals in November. Ewan, who did the
same course, celebrated his engagement
by taking out his degree at the recent
conferring at the Australian College of
Dentistry. He has been appointed de-
monstrator at the Dental Hospital for 12
months.
At a late-afternoon party at the Lyceum
Club Mrs. Arthur Hordern, British vice-
president of the International Club, dis-
closed that plans for the club ball on
October 6 include a grand march of
dancers, all in national costume, and
decorations of the various tables to be in
the distinctive manner of their homelands.
Flags of all nations will form part of the
decorations, and the stage will be
decorated with an international one-world
motif. Among those who were present at
the party were the club president, Mrs.
Herbert Brookes, who has just returned
from a holiday in Queensland; Lady
Harrison Moore and Mesdames M. R.
Macmillan and King Mouey. Greek
representative Mrs. L. Sigalis set off her
fair coloring with a deep-mist-blue wool
suit and large red hat. Mrs. A. Jacobsen
(Austria) wore a three-quarters-length
leopardskin coat over a black frock; her
black hat was osprey-trimmed. The hoh.
sec. of the International Club, Mrs. L. H.
Eyles, chose suitings of grey. Mrs. G. H.
Hargreaves, organising secretary, added
a navy redingote and winged navy
corduroy velvet hat to her grey frock.
Tickets for the ball may be obtained at
the clubrooms, Manchester Unity Build-
ings, Collins-street.
Moonee Valley brought no sartorial
surprises; the only variation on winter’s
theme were the straw-hats which were
worn with tweed suits. Soft leaf-green
was a popular shade. Mrs. R. Harper
chose this color for her suit, the jacket
featuring the longer backline, the skirt
being pencil-slim; her large hat of felt
was in the same shade. The deep bur-
gundy of her ensemble was repeated in the
hat and shoes of Mrs. J. T. Madden.
Green feathers adorned the small black
hat Mrs. Ken Hooper wore with her
black tailored suit. Keera Camerons
suit of passionfruit-green featured hand-
made flower buttons-; her hat matched
the suit. Mrs. J. T. Fairbairn allied
check jacket and plain brown skirt; her
large felt hat was trimmed with feather
wings. A gold-toned felt hat offset the
grey flannel suit worn by Wyn Kellow.
Mrs. Fred Colahan wore a russet wool
coat with her black frock and black hat.
Mrs. Ned Holland’s black tailored suit
had the new nipped-in waistline; the
skirt was tight and slit at the side-seam.
A leaf-green hat trimmed with large
chenille choux on the brim added bright-
ness. Mrs. Peter Watkins and Mrs. Clive
Fenner favored the grey suit. Mrs. James
Buchanan’s wool suit was misty-blue ; her
large hat in the same tonings had the
new rolled brim.
Mrs. Bruce Bretherton is hon. secretary
for the Battle of Britain Ball now being
organised by the Air Force Womens
Association. Mrs. Bretherton is the wife
of a former fighter-pilot, and they have
one small son. Before her marriage she
was Betty Grey, daughter of Captain and
Mrs. T. H. Grey, of Toorak, and was
educated! at Toorak College. Tennis is
her favorite relaxation —she was captain
of the school team. While her prospective
husband was at the war, Betty was busy
nursing at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.
The Battle for Britain Ball will be held
at St. Kilda Town Hall tonight. Photo,

Winter departed from this city like a
lamb, but spring came in on the wings of
a gale, and with it came vivacious
Henriette Lamotte and her collection of
millinery, shown against the misty-grey
decorations of the La Louvre Salon.
Many of the hats were copies of famous
French designs: Maud et Nano and
Maud Roser to name a few; but what
copies! There was a wide-brimmed sailor
of blue-and-white-striped taffeta; for
trimming it boasted a large white wing,
black apple and sprays of pink apple-
blossom. Named Roof of Paris, a very
wide, flat, toast-colored coarse straw had
no trimming except two large hatpins
topped with the straw, and with black
chenille-dotted veiling for contrast. White
Swiss embroideries fashioned a side-tilted
frilly hat, finished with veiling and black
velvet bows. A veritable orchard was a
pink silk straw hat trimmed with ripe
strawberries and cherries, black grapes and
pink and yellow blossom. A “naughty
’nineties” wide-brimmed sailor of honey-
toned straw was trimmed with wide bows
of ruby-red velvet. Very novel was the
narrow black patent-leather belt which
trimmed a white broderie Anglaise sailor,
which also sported white wings. Cherries
and mauve lilac highlighted a platter-
shape hat of mauve Swiss embroidery. A
shocking pink silk crinoline straw hat
was niched with matching tulle, and
pearls embroidered the black veil which
swept across the hat. Pearlshells were
used effectively in a number of models,
and every hat had its attractive hatpins.
In creations ranging from bonnets to out-
size sailors fruit, flowers and feathers
were used with abandon.
One of the year’s social events is the
ball entirely organised by a group of
business and professional men, members
of the Cordiality Club. Each year the
proceeds of the ball are given to a chanty,
last year over £lOOO was handed to the
Austin Hospital. This year the proceeds
will be donated to the Deaf and Dumb
Children’s Kindergarten. Venue is St.
Kilda Town Hall, the date Friday,
September 24. Among the energetic
young men working for the successor
the ball are Frank Nicholas, who takes
the chair at all meetmgs ; David Nicholls,
a vice-president, Bill Payne hon. secretary
with Darrell North, hon. treasurer.
Tickets are one-guinea. Ring Liy/so.
From Sydney
It takes all sorts to make a city! Hot
along the trail blazed by the Old Vic., the
S.U.D.S. last week presented “Pericles”
and Cocteau’s “Orpheus.” The Metropoli-
ton Players put on Congreve’s “Love for
Love” with great success, “Annie Get
Your Gun” packed the Royal, Ben Blue
kept things lively at the Tiv., and the
Town Hall zipped along with Graeme
Bell and his Australian jazz band. This
was heady stuff, and even the Victorian
chandelier in the foyer looked ready to
sway into the rhumba. The Town Hall
seethed with teen-agers, youth of all ages,
and wild enthusiasm.
The S.U.D.S. commenced their season
of Shakspeare’s “Pericles” with its
riddle-me-ree opening last Saturday
night at the Conservatorium. Packed
house greeted the players, and among
cables of good wishes was one from Mrs.
Michael Hayward, now in London, who
as Betty King did a grand job of publicity
for S.U.D.S. production of “Hassan” last
year. Professor H. R. Dew and Mrs.
Dew received the official guests, among
them the Chancellor of the University,
knight Bickerton Blackburn, France's
Consul-General and Mrs. de la Croix.
Mrs, Dew’s fine woollen dinner-frock was
lobelia-blue in tone. Mrs. de la Croix
wore smoke-grey chiffons cosily accom-
panied by silver-fox furs. Professor D. R.
Peart, who holds the new chair of music
at Sydney University, composed special
music for this production and conducted
the orchestra. Cocteau’s “Orpheus’
made up the double bill.
Friends and admirers all over Aus-
tralia will be glad to learn that Dame
Constance D’Arcy is now convalescing,
and doing very well, indeed, after a long
and trying illness.
Sydney will hold its Flower Festival
from September 22 to 25. As usual, it
will bloom in the Domain, up towards
St. Mary’s Cathedral. This year, however,
the heavy-looking Army tents will be re-
placed by tents flashing green-and-white
stripes in the sun-—if the weather is as
sympathetic towards Red Cross as the
rest of the city. For, of course, Red
Cross is to benefit. The International
Group, of which the Harry Moxham lady
is the president, is very active. The Scan-
dinavian Group is building a Viking ship
to moor on the lawn right at their front
doorsteps. This will be long and high
and made entirely of flowers.
The French have" designed a salon- as
dainty as a beauty box. It will display
ceramics—-all sorts of gadgets to wear in
the lapel or the spring bonnet. There
will be French pastries that might have
come from one of those little shops by
the Madeleine. Norway’s Mrs. Jorstad,
already noted for her national dishes, is
arranging for her compatriots to furnish
a stall daily with freshly-baked delicacies.
There will be a Chelsea village designed
by Gladys Lister, not to mention the
glorious wildflowers out of our own west,
and from various Pacific Island
neighbors.
Jocelyn Scott Cuttle, pictured here by
John Lee, and Paul Chadwick Brown an-
nounced their engagement last Friday
night. They circled the announcement
with a party of 16 friends at Prince s,
when her lovely ring of emeralds and
diamonds stirred a loud murmur of ap-
probation. Jocelyn is a keen supporter
of Legacy, and has worked three days a
week in this cause since leaving Abbots-
leigh, her old school. She is also an en-
thusiastic polocrosse-player, and, like her
affianced, plays for the Camden Polo
Crosse Club. Paul is the younger son of
the A. T. Browns, of The Oaks via Cam-
den. Jocelyn’s parents are the John
Cuttles, of Woollahra, and they are con-
noisseurs and collectors of Australian
art On their walls hang Heysens,
Streetons, Gruners and others of our
great.
This Letter owns that tenor Miklos
Gafni fills her with delight. She agrees
with the Girl in the Flat Opposite, who
says it’s so nice to hear a Voice and no
■ only Art in a singer. The Gafm conceit
last Wednesday night brought out the
girls as inevitably as spring calls up tn
lark. The audience was more than ou
per cent, women —from teen-agers up-
wards. They followed every ana, even
the classic first half of the programme,
with close attention, and their applause
was like the unleashing of a wild hail-
storm. Miklos is a big, young man, bu
does not appear so robust as his size
might suggest. His young years spent m a
Nazi prison-camp might account tor this.
Anyway, with hard study (and f e^f r
concerts) he’s a Caruso or a Thill in the
making. He included in his programme a
song by Australian composer Oscar
Walters. It is called “My Love Song to
a Tree,” and was received with great
favor.
Producer May Hollinworth and her
Metropolitan Players drew quite a full
house last Tuesday night with their
presentation of “Love for Love.” There
was quite a company of writing-men and
-women, some “intellectuals” and people
who just like a play for the play’s sake
sitting on the tiered seats of this tiny
theatre. Congreve’s play proved just as
plummy with humor as it did when
it was introduced to itsi Lincoln Inn
Fields audience over two and a hair
centuries ago. As persistent a little gold-
digger as the heroine introduced in that
bygone best-seller “Gentlemen Prefei
Blondes” is his Mrs. Frail. But Prue, the
“Miss” of the piece, refused to cry Love
Me, Sailor” when Ben (her father’s choice
for her) came back from sea.
Enjoying the fun were the educational
Camilla Wedgwood, anthologist Dr.
Mackaness and his wife, and one of the
chiefs of the Education Department.
Maybe the Minister of Education intends
to put a rhyming Congreve into the
kindergartens! Jean Garling, whodoes
a neat piece of acting herself, was there.
Mrs. Rupert Wilson, of Oberon, writes
to tell that she and husband are off to
Western Australia. He will follow the
route of the Aberdeen Angus from Miff*
bourne onwards. They leave Sydney by
plane on the 22nd, and Melbourne is their
first hop. Big excitement is Aberdeen A.
judging, and then the society s dinner at
night. In Perth Mrs. Wilson has been
accredited to attend C.W.A.A., and con-
ference affairs will engross her during the
next three days. The dates of conference
and Perth’s .R.A.S. fit into one another
very neatly. In fact, Perth will be quite
a rallying-place for cattlemen and their
wives. Rupert expects to gain much
knowledge from the cattle exhibitions,
and Mrs. R. hopes to pick up a nugget
or two on the way home, which is by way
of Kalgoorlie.
The Torchbearers for Legacy have
sent out invitations for their Spring
Carnival Dinner Dance. This will be
held at Princes on Monday, September
27, and will prance from nine o’clock on-
wards. President of the committee is
Mrs. Lionel McFadyen; Mrs. John
Keep and Mrs. D. Cleiand are the ticket
secretaries. F 81944, F 82750. There s a
sleekly-caparisoned and fiery steed (per-
haps there are a few thorns in the gar-
lands twined about him) on the cover of
the invitation. It’s quite a hint for the
A.J.C. fathers. Why not dolly up the
steeds like that for the Royal race meet-
ing next year?
Appropriate guests for the Society of
Women Writers are Mr. and Mrs. Gyde
(in professional life she is known as
Sophie Wyss) and Mr, and Mrs. Hall.
Both men represent the publishing firm
of Heinemann. Feminist Club at one
o’clock tomorrow are the place and the
hour.
Pianist Trixie Tange (Mrs. H. J. Evans)
has been appointed hon. adjudicator in
piano senior open championship during
the forthcoming Sydney Eisteddfod. The
winner will carry off a silver cup given
by Mr. Evans. The Cup is valued at 45
guineas, and Mr. Evans will also toss in
a cash prize of 50 guineas. Beatrice is
donating a prize valued at 20 guineas
for*the 21-years-and-under entrants in the
Bach championship, which she will also
judge.
Havilah Children’s Home at Norman-
hurst will benefit from a dance which is
being arranged by the staff of Hassett and
Johnson, wholesale druggists. The State
ballroom has been engaged for Tuesday,
October 12, and the president and com-
mittee are working for a big success.
The Anti-tank Regiment, A.I.F. Asso-
ciation, will hold its Third Annual Ball,
under the patronage of Lieut.-General
Sir Leslie Morshead, at Paddington
Town Hall on Friday, October 1. Tickets
are 12s. 6d. each. Bookings close on
September 27. Organiser is R. Neill,
UA4195.
President of the New Zealand Club,
Mrs. E. Hempton, and a very active com-
mittee are working for the club’s annual
ball. This will celebrate Dominion Day,
and will be held in the Town Hall on
Friday, October 1. The Totally and Per-
manently Disabled Soldiers’ Funds will
benefit.

THE SERVICE MAN
"Progress" in Berlin.
“Ek Dum”: In spite of the
whistling with which politicians
have tried to keep their courage
up, the world is very near to
war, and the events in Berlin
bring it nearer.
Relations have been deterior-
ating for the past fortnight. The
Russians, as usual, agreed at the
end of August to a plan “in
principle” —this is their normal
technique—but they also
the normal agreement with
themselves that when it came to
the practical application of the
plan they would see either that it
did not come to execution or that,
if it did, it would not work.
A basic arrangement arrived
>at in Moscow that the Soviet
' mark should be recognised as
the sole .currency in Berlin, but
that it should be subject to four-
Power control, was remitted to
the Berlin authorities to be im-
plemented.
The four military Governors
met for this purpose—General
Robertson (Britain), General
Clay (U.S.), General Koenig
(France), and Marshal Sokolov-
sky. The meeting began on the
evening of August 31 at- the
building of the Allied Control
Authority. It was adjourned
after a brief session, but dis-
cussions have since continued.
The same evening Russian-
controlled newspapers were
ordered to hold their pages open
for an important announcement.
It came in the early morning in
the form of an official Russian
account of a meeting between
General Kotikov and a delega-
tion of workers from the East-
ern zone. These true democrats,
it seemed, were concerned at a
proposal to declare the area
round the City Hall a neutral
zone in which demonstrations
should not take place.
The delegation, from Commu-
nist bodies, was deeply up-
set at this undemocratic
suggestion. What is the use of
having democracy and free
speech if one cannot have the
authority to prevent the oppo-
sition having them? Then the
delegation demanded that there
should be no association be-
tween Berlin and the “Western
State,” that a peace treaty should
be arranged quickly and that
all occupation troops should
withdraw leaving, of course,
the Communist party, fully
armed and organised by the
Russians, in charge of Berlin and
of the country.
At that point a Major Lepe-
dev, of the Russian zone, a
truculent fellow who refused to
show his papers, was arrested by
the British, and a threat was
issued in the name of General
Kotikov that if he was not im-
mediately released by a certain
time six British officers would
be abducted. However, it ap-
peared on inquiry that General
Kotikov repudiated the order
issued apparently under his
authority.
Attacks on the West
The opening of September in
Berlin was celebrated by the
publication in the Berlin “Tag-
liche Rundschau,” official organ
of the Soviet Military Com-
mand, of an article headed “War
on the Warmongers,” proving
conclusively that Russia was the
only peacefully inclined and
guiltless country in the world.
It came strangely on the anni-
versary of the outbreak of World
War II against Poland, a war
contrived after an agreement
had been reached between Hitler
and Stalin to split the booty.
The “Rundschau” demanded to
be told whether “these English
Churchills and De Gaulles and
their German-speaking parrots
in human form were really men-
tally and morally all there.” All
the other Soviet-controlled jour-
nals, whose editorials are usually
dictated to them by an official
spokesman, followed the same
line of attack exactly.
This began the period of “sue-
cess” at Moscow. While poli-
ticians there talked softly, the
Berlin Military Command, under
a marshal fresh from the Krem-
lin, whither he had gone for in-
structions, began to take con-
trol of the whole city.
The first step was the destruc-
tion of the Magistral —the City
Council—which had a meeting-
place at the New Town Hall in
the Russian sector, and which
now was thrown open to the
operations of a mob from Wed-
din and other tough suburbs in
the Russian sector, backed and
perhaps organised by the Rus-
sian Governmental authorities.
This series of incidents cul-
minated in the City Council
moving its meeting-place into
the British sector, and in inci-
dents between Russian troops
and Western German police
which reached their peak when
some of the latter were snatched
by armed Russians from a mili-
tary wagon under guard by
French soldiers. This, at any
previous period in European
history, would have been re-
garded as an act of war, but it
was normal to the tenor of life
in Berlin,
Meeting in the Tiergarten
Berlin has a very strong pub-
lic opinion which is not naturally
favorable to Communism, since
most of Germany’s troubles
have arisen from Communist
operations, including the rise of
Hitler, who came to power when
the country felt that he was the
only alternative to Stalin. It
manifested itself on September
10 in a great public demonstra-
tion in the Tiergarten.
The Tiergarten is the Hyde
Park of Berlin, the heart of its
West End. It is in the British
sector. Its eastern end,
opening through the Branden-
burger Gate into Unter den
Linden, marks the boundary be-
tween the British and Russian
zones, which runs southward
through the Potsdamer Platz.
The Russians, when they first
came and before the zones
defined, had built a huge and
ugly memorial to their victory
in the Konigsplatz in the Tier-
garten —a sort of heathen idol
on a grand scale glorifying the
great Stalin and all his works.
Just inside the Tiergarten and
in its north-eastern corner stands
the Reichstag Building, facing
the opera house across the
Konigsplatz, with its heroic
memorials.
It was between this spot,
sacred to German history, and
the Brandenburg Gate that the
crowd assembled. It was appar-
ently noisy but orderly, after the
fashion of German crowds. It
cheered anti - Communist
speeches to the echo and ob-
served a minute’s silence to
honor victims of Nazi and Com-
munist tyranny.
In the strange hotchpotch of
Berlin it is quite normal that the
Russians should maintain a
regular armed guard on their
war memorial in the British
zone. The changing of this
guard was arranged unfortu-
nately when the meeting was at
a critical stage of breaking up.
Most of the crowd left quietly,
but the sight of the armed
Russians coming out of the
Linden proved too much for the
younger hotheads.
One of them, Wolfgang Schu-
mann, 15 years old, climbed
the Brandenburg Gate and tore
down the Russian flag. He was
promptly shot dead —it would
be interesting to hear the Aus-
tralian Communist party on the
shooting.
Two other boys threw the flag
into the crowd in spite of the
Russians who opened fire on the
demonstrators with machine-
guns. The crowd was, of course,
in British territory and bad not
entered the Linden on the
Russian side of the gate. At least
a dozen casualties were reported.
Meanwhile the Russian guard
in its jeep, armed to the teeth,
drove recklessly through the
crowd in the British sector, irre-
spective of the danger to peace-
fully retiring attendants at the
meeting. This is typical of Rus-
sian “democratic” method, in
which any armed soldier goes in
a straight line when in a vehicle,
irrespective of whom he kills.
They nearly knocked down
several of the crowd, which be-
came hostile, hooted the visitors
and began stone-throwing. A
Russian jumped out of the jeep
and levelled his revolver at the
crowd, but was taken in charge
by a calm British police captain
who, with his men, escorted the
jeep from the square while its
contents shouted alternatively
for protection and in execration
of the British police, whom it
described, along with the Ger-
mans, as “filthy fascists.”
The situation by the night of
September 10 was ominous, the
more so since the Russian news-
agency had issued a statement
that Russian police had been
fired on from the British terri-
tory and that “some badly-in-
jured Soviet police were ab-
ducted into the British zone.”
It is more dangerous still in
view of the obvious intention of
the Russians to prevent German
demonstrations against Com-
munism wherever held. The
Russian military command
issued a statement that it will
not tolerate openly “fascist
“She’s not responding too Well to the helm.”
speeches by city leaders.” Any
speech which does not laud
Communism to the skies is, in
the eyes of the Russians, a fas-
cist speech. Anybody opposed
to Communism, whether he be
British, American or German, is
not only a fascist —but “filthy”
and “vicious.” And next day
there was a Russian organised
meeting, under tommy - gun
guard, in the Lustgarten, Hitler’s
old Berlin ranting - ground.
Russian speakers abused the
Western Allies.
With the air-lift having broken
the blockade of Berlin, the Rus-
sians have thought of a new
method of hampering it. They
have announced that they are
about to hold full-scale air
manoeuvres over the city, and
have demanded that British and
American air authorities shall
give notice an hour in advance
of the beginnings and routes of
all flights into the German capi-
tal. This demand has been re-
jected out of hand. It looks as
if the matter has reached a crisis,
and there is talk of referring it
to U.N.O.
In Asia
There seems no doubt that
the Russians are working de-
liberately for war, and for early
war. In Malaya and Burma their
campaign of Communist rebel-
lion goes on apace.
General MacArthur has de-
nounced their action in keeping
500,000 Japanese war prisoners,
who were to have been released
at the rate of 50,000 a month,
using them as slaves to make
munitions for the Russian Army
and to build aggressive defence
projects.
At U.N.O.’s committee on self-
government even the Australian
Government representative has
accused the Soviet of using
U.N.O. bodies as a propaganda
forum to incite rebellion in the
world’s 70 colonies. It would be
interesting to hear Mr. Chifley
and Dr. Evatt on the subject,
since their policy has been
largely responsible for the unrest
within the Pacific zone, the basis
of most of which was organised
years ago by men who are now
valued members of the Chifley
following.
The latest development in the
Australasian field has been the
clarification of the situation in
Indonesia. A few weeks ago it
was announced that the Soviet
Union had decided to establish
a Legation at Jokjakarta.
Last week it was stated by the
Indonesian official news-agency
that the Socialist party, of which
the Japanese collaborator. Dr.
Sjarifoedin, Premier for three
months last year, is leader, as
well as the Labor party, has de-
cided to merge with the Com-
munist party. Dr. Sjarifoeddin
admitted that he had been a
secret member of the Communist
party since 1935.
This is the first substantive step
towards the Communist con-
quest of Malaya.
France’s Position
The situation in France is an
encouragement to Russian
aggression. Whatever may <#me
out of its crises it is obvious that
it must be some time before it
can defend itself.
France at present is the plague
of Western Europe, its politicians
so self-seeking and distrusted, its
people so politically divided and
so corrupted by the example of
its leaders that it is a chaos in
which the motto is “every man
for himself.” France, in fact,
is what Australia is likely to be-
come if it has another 20 years
of the kind of national govern-
ment which it is enduring—-
government by men who have
a blind eye for the black-
marketeer and the lawbreaker
of the right color, some of whose
members themselves are peren-
nially in some sort of legal
trouble, and who will brigade
themselves with anybody except
“rightists” who are likely to
have principles in order to keep
office.
In the British zone the mili-
tary activity is notable. British-
U.S. joint military exercises are
in progress in Western Germany.
Joint British-U.S. fleets are
gathering at Gibraltar, the
largest aggregation of warships
in European waters since 1945.
The air exercises now closing
over virtually the whole of
the North Sea and eastern Britain
were obviously meant to try out
new techniques which have not
been tested in war.
R.A.A.F. Training
It is to be hoped that the
lads who have gone from the
R.A.A.F. to help in the air-lift
to Berlin are not allowed to view
these exercises too suddenly. It
has been announced that these
men, whom Mr. Drakeford pre-
sumably believes to be trained
up to the minute and ready to
ward off enemy bombers or de-
stroy the approaching flotilla
without special preparation, are
considered overseas to need
“familiarisation and training”
before they are ready to fly in
cargo-wallahs to Berlin on a
route with which some of them
must be familiar.
There can be only one reason
for that. Radar developments
since the war have left us lagging
in the tall timber. The R.A.A.F.
have not a modernly-trained
aircrew in respect of radar, and
time is not likely to be a healer.
Who is going to give the latest
details and inventions to the air-
force of a Power which recruits
political bosses from the Com-
munist party and which allows
a war to be conducted against
part of its own British Com-
monwealth by Communists who
receive the strongest support and
direction from Australian fellow-
travellers?
Troops in Japan.
The report of Mr. Haylen,
M.P., illustrates to the full the
powers of observation of the
leader of the delegation to
Japan. The committee of
chaplains who visited 8.C.0.F.
recently and whose report was
designated by Mr. Haylen him-
self as a “good, sober report”
declared:
We have been amazed to observe
the magnificent scope of amenities
provided for the welfare of 8.C.0.F.
troops, and are unable to conceive
any aspect wherein ample provision
has not been made, It is evident that
no Australian force has ever been
better served.
Major-General Lloyd and Mr.
Massey Stanley reported that
the amenities of the troops were
superior to any British forces
hitherto have experienced, “in
many cases approaching luxury.”
But listen to Mr, Haylen:
Apparently it does not count for
anything that our troops are sweating
it out in a climate which is intoler-
able for three months in the year,
without any of the customary ameni-
ties of life. The inevitable conse-
quence is that they are driven in upon
themselves.
It might not be a bad thing
to send him back to Japan so
that the troops there could ex-
press their appreciation of his
effort. Round his neck might
be hung, upon the occasion of
his ceremonial landing, the fol-
lowing piece from his exposi-
tion :
The troops are crowded together,
deprived of amenities, separated from
the company of women, and whilst I
do not intend to go into further ex-
planation of the matter at present, I
think every honorable member under-
stands the inference to be drawn from
those facts
The spectacle of Mr. Haylen ex-
plaining this to the rank and file
of 8.C.0.F. should be worth
seeing.
The Hyderabad agency at
Karachi reported on September
12 that Indian troops had in-
vaded its territories. This was
at first denied, and the truth
was not apparent when this page
went to press. The situation’s
seriousness lies in the fact that
Hyderabad is a Moslem-ruled
State, and the repercussions of
war against it by the Hindus are
likely to reach far beyond its
borders. Coming at the moment
of the death of Mr. Jinnah, the
whole business is more than un-
fortunate.

Ancestors of
an
Industry
James Muspratt was the founder of the British alkali
industry. The manufacture of sodium carbonate, one form of
which is the familiar “washing soda, and other alkalis is one
of the most important branches of the chemical industry Ihe
first commercial process for making them depended on the use
of sulphuric acid and produced hydrochloric acid as a by-
product. Ever since James Muspratt opened his worksi n
Liverpool a century and a quarter ago, alkali and mineral acid
manufacture have frequently been closely bound together.
Muspratt. though born in Ireland, was of English parentage.
At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a wholesale
druaqist in Dublin, but four years later, in 1811, he , gave ,V; P
commerce and made his way to Spain, where he fought m the
PenSar War. Returning to England he joined the Royal
Navy as a midshipman, but found conditions in his ship so
intolerable that he deserted, returned to Ireland, and started a

RED MILL RUM.
In both Sydney and Melbourne on
Saturday there was lurther evidence
that the present crop of three-year
olds is the best we have had for years
The youngsters won the w.f.a. events
at both Randwick and Moonee Val-
ley and in doing so beat the hitherto
best w.f.a. horses of the land.
It was a Tattersall s dub meeting
at Randwick with the w.f.a. Chelms-
ford Stakes the main event. A field
of seven, of whom five were three-
year-olds, started in the Chelmsford,
and Columnist, at odds-on, beat only
one horse home. Staging a perfectly-
timed finish, after. Riptide had set a
hot pace for eight of the nine fur-
longs, Shannon’s young brother Bern-
brook (N. Sellwood) just managed to
stave off the even more brilliant finish-
ing effort of the Victorian three-year-
old Carbon Copy. There was a neck
between the first pair, and a neck
further back Dark Marne ran a race
which had “Metrop.” written all over
it.
Another three-year-old, Vagabond,
was fourth, followed by Riptide, who
should be improved by the run. With-
out detracting from the excellent
showings of the younger horses,
Columnist’s effort was too bad to
represent his true form. Viewed be-
fore the race he gave an impression
of having lightened off considerably.
Bernbrook’s win, following on his
earlier success against open company
in the Campbelltown Handicap, has
put him at the head of the list for
the Derby, which he may, too, be
good enough to win; certainly his
form cannot be faulted, nor his breed-
ing. His sire, Midstream, is by Bland-
ford, sire of four English Derby-
winners, while his dam, Idle Words,
is a Magpie mare. Shannon ran
nowhere in the Derby, but sub"
sequently showed himself capable of
running a tiptop mile and a half.
Punters who had taken Beau Robert
as their first leg in early Epsom-
Metrop. doubles were congratulating
themselves after seeing the Beau Vite
gelding finish a handy fourth in the
seven-furlongs Tramway Handicap;
half an hour later their wine turned
to vinegar with an announcement that
the horse had been scratched from
all Randwick Spring engagements;
the Caulfield Cup is said to be his
mission.

the Spring Handicap. Blue Legend,
with his grand record in the rich mile
handicaps, is wonderfully welt handi-
capped with only 8.12 for the Epsom,
but he may, in his advancing years,
prefer just a shade more distance.
Most impressive of other winners
at Randwick was the Westralian visi-
tor Filipino. He looked k good type
of horse, standing in his stall early
in the afternoon; just as good when
seen parading before the Welter, and
even better after seen simply refusing
to be beaten by Mirrigen in a battling
finish. The rest of the programme
amounted to a triumph for jockey
N. Sellwood, in great form now after
his bad run last season. Apart from
winning the Chelmsford on Bern-
brook, Sellwood took the first Novice
on Caribbean, the second on Royal
Souvenir, and the Three- and Four-
year-old Handicap on Set Purpose,
downing Lone Duke and Snowstream.

A field of only five starting in the
mile wi.a. Glenroy Stakes at Moonee
Valley on Saturday made up in qual-
ity what it lacked in quantity; the
starters were Royal Gem, Money
Moon, Chanak, Valcurl and the three-
year-old colt Phoibos (H. Badger).
Description of the race is easy—the
youngster was too fast for ’em. At
“I'll have a quid on the red-headed bloke..”
the finish he was a length clear of
Money Moon with Chanak a couple
of lengths further back.
It was a fine performance but sug-
gested that a mile may be nearly as
far as Phoibos will care to go. He
was tiring fast at the finish, while
Money Moon, conceding him 191 b.,
was bridging the gap at every stride.
The Caulfield Guineas should be a
gift for Phoibos, but the Derby would
seem beyond him.
Having his first run after a spell,
Crown Gem, of owner G. W. Bad-
man’s increasing family of Gems,
downed Saxony, New England and a
number of others in the Chandos
Handicap, for which Sentiment had
started an even - money favorite.
Breasley on the winner rode one of
those model races of his, not cover-
ing a single unnecessary inch of
ground, biding his time in a handy
position on the rails and coming
through for a well-timed win. Crown
Gem conceded weight to all but Senti-
ment and ran the mile smartly m
].3Bi; Phoibos clocked the same time
in his race.
In the Cumberland Handicap for
three-year-old colts and geldings the
High Caste colt High Tar, earlier con-
sidered a Derby prospect, again let
backers down, starting favorite and
being beaten three-parts of a length
by the 14-to-l chance Derrymorc (R.
Heather); Lord Clive was third. The
Banyule Handicap for the fillies gave
punters another dose of the same
medicine, favorite Gay Silhouette
being beaten even more decisively by
Star of the East (D. Barclay). So
too, it was, earlier, in the Boomerang
Hurdle, with 5-to-2 favorite Sir
Charles downed by Sir Nolte (R.
Deane), who gave an exhibition of
really good jumping.
Undaunted by a sequence of 15
consecutive losing favorites (carried
on from the past couple of meetings),
the good souls who pay for the game
sent Lucky Robin (G. Bougoure) out
at 7-to-4 favorite for the 13-furlongs
Budgeree Handicap and were re-
warded with a winner. Never far
from the front the Robin Goodfellow
gelding had plenty in hand to stay
Mea dower and Glamis Star at the
finish; he would have more than a
rough chance in the Caulfield Cup
with a featherweight of 7.7.
The Windarra Welter, unusual in
being confined to four-, five- and six-
year - olds, required two divisions,
which went to Gallant Scout (R.
Hutchinson) downing Prince Curl and
Felstar, and to Jalna (J. Purtell) beat-
ing Law Case and Our Land. Before
the present crop of three-year-olds
have had done with them, connec-
tions of the more mediocre four-,
five- and six-year-olds may be earn-
estly wishing for more races confined
to such.

If Australian riders Edgar Britt and
“Togo” Johnstone continue as they ve
been doing in England, one can see
other leading riders packing their
bags. Johnstone actually does most
of his riding in France, but popped
over to take the Derby and several
other good races this year. Britt has

found as much to interest them at
North Sydney on Saturday as did the
thousands who flocked to see the
Rugby Union grand finals at the oval.
Thickly double-lining every street for
miles around were half the cars of
Sydney, representing every vintage
since Henry Ford drove a billy-cart.
At the oval the finalists were Rand-
wick and Manly; on the offensive
from.the first whistle, Randwick won
27-14—their first premiership since
1940. A remarkable performance was
put up by Manly winger Eddie Mor-
ton. Playing in the reserve-grade
final he scored all 14 points credited
to his side, which beat Easts 14-0.
Then he was called upon to substitute
for Clarrie Davis in the senior final
and scored a further three penalty
goals towards Manly’s total of 14
points.

ABORIGINALITIIES
Shamuseen”: It is in time of Nature’s
prodigality in the matter of honey-flow (B.
1/9/’4B) that the Noxth Queensland rain-
bow-birds are tagged with the misnomer
“bee-eaters.” The mistaken idea that the
fowl are bee-murderers arises from their
attempts to extract nectar from blossoms
at the same time as the bees, which
actions make it appear that they are din-
ing on the honey-gatherers. Dipsomania
is the worst aberration with which the
rainbow-birds can be rightly charged.
Under the stimulus of the nor’-west mon-
soon the nectar of most blossoms assumes
fermentative properties, rendering it
doubly acceptable to bird palates. Crazy-
flying, inter-avian belligerency and
supreme indifference to human approach
mark the behavior of the birds at such
seasonal phases. When not under the
influence they are as shy as any normal
bush denizen.

that trickled through into his neighbor’s
paddocks. “Why don’t you dig the
flamin’ things out an’ be done with it?
Jim demanded testily. “Who? Me? Aw,
cripes, I couldn’t dig ’em out,” wailed
the weary one. “An’ y’ know I can’t get
a man anywhere.” “Awright, I’ll come
an’ dig the blankers out meself,” was the
impatient retort. “Y’ll have t’ tucker me.
I’ll start Monday.” During the next few
weeks Jim slogged away doggedly at the
bunnies, and was getting towards the
far end of the paddock when Dan
dropped in. The visitor watched Fred
trot up the slope with billy and pack, wait
a while, then come back to the hut.
“How’s the rabbiting going?” Dan asked
him. “Awright,” puffed Fred. “Gripes,
I’ll be glad when, it’s over, though.
Hardest work J ever done.” “You?” ex-
claimed Dan. “I thought Jim was
digging ’em out.” “He is,” nodded Fred,
shoving a piece of wood on the fire, and
glancing towards the clock. “He is. But
look at me, will y’? Just look at me! Run
dog-poor, that’s what I am, tryin’t’ keep
the flamin’ tucker up t’ the cow!”

“Old Camp”: References to Lasseter’s
“Lost Reef” continue to bob up in the
press, the latest being the adventures in
starvation of two young aboriginals who
are said to have ventured out in quest of
the Eldorado. Of course there isn’t any
reef; if there was it would have been
located long ago. Experienced prospec-
tors have been looking over those border
ranges the Warburtons, the Rawlinsons,
even the Petermanns for the past 40
years; they have found indications of
gold, but nothing worth stopping for.
But, though Lasseter was obviously suf-
fering a delusion, it is too much to assert
that he had never before been in that
country. He probably had. For that’s
just the catch. Every observant gold-
fielder has met the old-timer who “knows
of something good.” Something which,
owing to the then pressure of circum-
stances, he left behind many years ago—
a veritable fortune if he could only get
back to it. So with Lasseter. Possibly
he had been somewhere round the W.A.-
S.A. border, had spotted a few pros-
pects, which had grown larger in his
imagination with the passing of years.

“8.A.”: Can any member of the
Council identify an arboreal marsupial
answering to the following description?
Its general conformation closely re-
sembles that of the common opossum,
but it is at least 30 per cent,
heavier. General color dark silver-
grey with dull white underparts;
fur long, dense and silky; head dark
silver-grey, with black muzzle ; ears small
and pointed, black on outer and grey on
inner parts; fore-paws and feet black;
tail long and heavily brushed with silky
black fur. The call of this animal con-
sists of a number of rapidly repeated
grunts, differing widely from the shrill,
chattering cry of the common opossum.
The specimen described was killed in the
big timber between the heads of the King
and Howqua Rivers (Vic.), at an altitude
of about 4500 ft. above sea - level.
Neither Lydekker’s Marsupials nor
Ellis Troughton’s Furred Animals of Aus-
tralia describes it.

“Old-timer”: In her 27th year ElVia,
eldest of five daughters of a German
farmer out of Mangoplah, became tired
of the family jokes about her single-
blessedness and apparent inability to per-
suade a man to the marriage ceremony.
One night she helped herself to £7 15s.

he probably owed her £1000) and her

the family hunted high and low
and mourned the loss of one who
had, hitherto, been chief nurse, cook,
bottle-washer and so forth from dawn
to dark. Then a drover camped on
the boundary cautiously admitted to
“hearin’ somethin’ about a young woman
bikin’ it t’ Melbourne” when he was in
Wodonga a fortnight before. Two years
passed ; then young Sam Collins, back
from Bendigo, swore he’d seen Elvia at
the Maryborough New Year sports. After
that nothing was heard for nearly five
years. Most of the other girls married
and went off, the two boys grew up and
worked the farm. One night a big car
pulled in and out of it got Elvia, a
husband and three children, radiating
happiness and prosperity. The mother
shrieked and collapsed in happy tears, the
old man went out and began looking over
the big car. Elvia’s husband asked him
“What do you think of her?” “Der bike?

demanded the old man.

“River Road”; An A.B.C. broadcast
on the epidemic of foot-and-mouth
disease in Mexico mentioned that Aus-
tralia has been kept free from rabies,
foot-and-mouth and rinderpest. Wes-
tralians won’t agree. Somewhere in the
1920’s a disease which was discovered as
rinderpest appeared in Sou’-Westralian
herds, and all cattle within specified areas
were destroyed and burnt. The compensa-
tion offered proved a big temptation to
dairymen just outside the areas, and
many a cow “wandered” across the line,
to be promptly grabbed by the rangers.
When the panic eased doubts were ex-
pressed as to the true nature of the
disease, but in the absence of any remain-
ing evidence the agreement lapsed.
Owners of inferior cattle were not the
only gainers. Woodcutters reaped a
harvest. It’s surprising how much wood
it takes to burn a cow.

“Murihiku”: Betcha “Betcha” has
never been in Southland bush in a bad
season. His cattle, clustered about the
trees while a clearing job was in progress,
moved off when they heard the “first
ominous crack” (B. 1/9/’4B). The first
sound of the axe in the Southland bush,
at least in some parts of it, is liable to
bring all the cattle for miles around at a
run. More than once. I’ve known an old
cow cop it as she came charging in ; but
the accident never deterred the rest of
her tribe, who fell to hungrily on the
leaves not only of the tree felled but of
the undergrowth it brought down with it.
In some bush districts it’s the only satis-
fying meal the poor beasts ever get. In
the district I’m thinking about the wife of
one of the leading settlers had aAnever-
failing method of calling the cattle home
in a hungry winter. She just took out the
axe and laid into a tree. Perhaps it was
natural for her to think of an axe in an
emergency—she was seldom without one
in her hand, having a good family of
men and half-grown boys to feed and
keep warm. And one one occasion she
fed them on pig for a week, after finding
a Captain Cooker 100 yards from her
back door and beaning it with the

“Kelms”; A Coolgardie (W.A.)
cauliflower that weighed 151 b. achieved
the fame that comes from a mention in
a “great daily.” The reporter who dis-
covered it—obviously a youngster—
described it as a “giant,” and marvelled
at its growth in “desert” soil. The report
drew a challenge from a visitor to a nor’-
west station, who weighed in with,
amongst other things, a 381 b. cauliflower,
grown in the Murchison and hailed in
the press as a record. It isn’t —one
weighing half a hundredweight was
grown at Belmont, not six miles out of
Perth —but the fertility of the “desert”
soil continues to amaze the daily. Why
“desert”? The Westralian goldfields
climate is dry, and may, with some justi-
fication, be termed desert. But the soil
itself is rich. It has nothing in common
with, say, the Sinai Desert, which is a
continuously-moving sea of barren sand.
Twenty years ago an adventurous
attempt to extend the Westralian wheat-
belt took seed and super, almost to
Southern Cross. The gods of fair be-
ginnings smiled, the heavens yielded a
10-inch rainfall, and the good earth re-
turned a 10-bag crop. A few years earlier
that soil had been termed desert. It
still is by those who have waited in vain
for a repetition of that first crop. But it
isn’t desert. It’s rich soil in a dry climate
bursting to produce. .

“P.K.N.”; “C.E.’s” friend (B. 7/7/’4B)
may have been able to pick his Red
Polls by their Christian names, but
could he do it at 60 m.p.h.? Coming
back from Temora (N.S.W.) one day,
Bert was trying out his new Chrysler and
slowed down to about 60 to pass a mob
of sheep which had been moved well to
the side of the road. Suddenly he braked
hard and started to swing round. When
asked if he had suddenly remembered
something he had forgotten to get in
town he answered, “No, but I might
have to go to town again. They’re my
brother’s sheep.” Closer inspection
proved they were his brother’s, and he
did make the return to town to report to
the police. But he might have saved that
trouble, as they would take no action
unless the report was made by the actual
owner.

“Failed 8.A.”: Surely “8.A.K.” is
merely kidding when he asks (B.
18/8/’4B) where the water went to when
Mac was mixing the concrete. Well, just
in case someone mightn’t know —it went
into the cement. Portland cement, as
also are caustic lime and plaster of Paris,
is avidly hygroscopic—that is, it has a
chemically-fierce desire to absorb water.
This, of course, is the foundation of its
process, as is also the case with the other
two mentioned. Caustic lime, which is
an alkali, combines in the presence of
water with the silica of quartz sand,
which chemically is an acid. Portland
cement is, roughly, a mixture of alkali
and acid earths, ground to exceedr
fineness, so as to mix intimately, th
roasted so as to expel all possible wate
Thus when brought in contact with wat
the two opposite elements leap togethe
absorbing water in the process of com
bination. This combination may becom
continuous up to a saturation-poin
which accounts for that extra few pin
required to be added after Mac left ti
mixture stand. Also, although the volum
may have shown a decrease after mix
ing, and still no increase after absor
ing those extra pints, had the mixec
cement been weighed it would have bee
found to have increased in weig]
almost to weight of the added wate
That it would not show the whole weigh

“Moukik”: “B.A.K.’s” speculations as
to how long a snake remains alive after
it is apparently dead (B. 11/8/’4B) re-
calls an experiment made in Paris some
40 years ago. Attending an execution by
guillotine of a notorious: gangster, the
doctor picked up the severed head the
instant it fell into the basket. The eyes
were closed, that being a marked feature
of death by guillotine. Holding the head
between his two palms, he called the de-
parted by name. The eyes opened, re-
turned his gaze for a moment, then
closed. Again the doctor called; and
again the eyes opened, though this tjme
only momentarily, then closed. A third
call brought no response. From this it
was inferred that even after decapita-
tion life remains in the brain for quite a
comprehensible period. This experiment
gives support to the tale told of the exe-
cution of Charlotte Corday, killer of
Marat, 1793. When her fair head fell
into the basket the executioner, eager for
mob applause, snatched it up. Holding it
aloft by its long hair he cried, “This is
the head of a murderess!” at the same
time slapping it on the cheek. Eye-wit-
nesses declared that at the blow the dead
girl’s: eyes opened, looked at him for a
moment reproachfully, then closed.

“C.E.”: Sunday morning, and the
town visitor, thinking hopefully of the
wild ducks up Reiley’s creek, waited for
Dad to finish his breakfast. “Sunday,
eh?” The old bloke stretched luxuriously.
“Want t’ shoe the nags t’day, while I’m
doin’ nothin’. Might’s well get ’em in, 1
s’pose.” All the morning he shod horses
and mended broken parts in the toolshed.
“That back-gate wants fixing, Dad,” Mum
reminded, as she came in to dinner. He
nodded. “Righto, Mum, I better do that
t’day,” he agreed. “Want t’ put a new
thatch on the machine-shed first though,
an’ cut another swingle-bar. There’s the
fence round the calf paddick, too, an’ I
thought I might grub that big stump out
o’ the veg’table garden t’day, and bum
the rubbish.” He finished the stump, was
called to tea, and went back with the
lantern to fix the back-gate. Monday
morning, and the town visitor thought
wistfully of the wild ducks on Reiley’s
creek. As Dad rose from the breakfast-
table he broached the subject. “A trip
after ducks? Now, why didn’t y’ mention
it yes’d’y, me lad?” boomed Dad, shaking
his head regretfully. “Yair, I’d like t’
go, awright, but cripes, a bloke c’d hardly

“Herbert Dawson”: Add to the adze-
artists the manager of an Upper Dawson
(Q.) grazing property, a handyman with
any tool. He and a couple of lads were
mustering a paddock for dipping one
morning when they picked up a big
“mickey,” missed somehow in the
recent mustering. Being old enough
to get calves he couldn’t be let
go retaining this faculty, so he was
promptly brought to earth. Then the
manager cursed on discovering that his
knife was missing from his belt-pouch.
Strangely enough neither of the lads was
carrying any sort of blade. But the
trump wasn’t beaten. Remembering
that an adze had been left at the dip he
got that and operated to his satisfaction.
THE HATTER.
Down in the gully timber
I never walk with ease
Because of the things that are hiding
The other side of the trees,
Cunning as old goannas,
Quick as a snake in the grass,
Keeping the trunk between us,
Peering to see me pass.
Never yet have I caught them
Face to face on the track,
But their eyes bore through my being.
Always behind my back;
They cheat and vex and evade me
Out on the old patrol,
Every tree with its shadow,
Every tree with a soul,
Coming home late from the township
Times, when the bullfrogs shout
Al jd all on a sudden fall silent
While a mopoke calls “Look out! ”
Though 1 dare not hurry my footsteps,
Dare not break to a run,
I come to the end of the timber
Sweating and almost done.
Why shfiuld they watch and waylay me?
How should I cause annoy?
Do I spoil their share of sunshine
Or mar their midnight joy?
Some day I’ll know the answer
And see what my old dog sees
When he snarls with rising hackles
At something there in the trees.
VICTORIA.

“Bo”; As the big saw screamed into
he huge bluegum log the foreman hap-
pened to look up. A stranger a little
way up the track had just reined in his
horse, which with dilated eyes and
nostrils had leaped sideways at the terri-
fying sound, and was shouting something
and waving an arm near his face. The
foreman couldn’t hear what he said, and
shouted something back that was swal-
lowed up in the all-enveloping whine of
the saw. Again the horseman’s mouth
opened but his puny voice was again lost.
Again his right arm came up and his face
seemed to be deeply agitated. The fore-
man caught some of the anxiety himseif.
Perhaps there had been a serious accident
and the horseman wanted urgent help.
At last, his imagination getting the upper
hand, he switched off the saw. As the
whirling teeth whined to a stop the horse-
man moved his arm up near his face and
shouted again ; this time his voice roared
across the distance; “Blasted flies are
crook for so early in the season, ain’t
they!” Now can you blame sawmillers
for developing that sawny look?

“Golden Mile”: Although the pound-
ing fall of a single battery-stamper is
individual, as soon as a combination of
the same mounts to ten all individual
sounds merge into a roar, lo hear a
100-stamp battery in operation is some-
thing never to be forgotten. On the
Boulder Belt in its prime there were some-
thing like 500 stamps dropping, together
with several dozen big ball-mills ; perhaps
50 crackers crunching stone, the whole
making a roar like that of a not-distant
angry sea. Dropping down a mine shaft
one lost the roar at about 10ft, below
surface. Inside a battery-house of over
50 stamps the noise to a newchum was
deafening. Which once led a goldfields
poet to turn out some satirical verse in
which Bill the battery-hand, in a Boulder
Block pub, skites of how he “roused hell
out of the boss last night,” concluding
with the refrain, “but it was in the bat-
tery.” That versifier, however, didn’t
quite know his onions, for Bill would
have been slammed very quick had he
tried such a thing; although it is neces-
sary to shout into the ear of the new-
chum, the eardrums of old hands have
long become tuned to the incessant roar,
and conversation between them can be
carried on at normal tone.

“B. A. Ker”: I’d always found keen
enjoyment in a walk through the bush
before the sun has taken the sparkle from
the dew, but this walk, half an hour after
sunrise, with the air brisk to the point
of frostiness, was even more enjoyable.
It’s true that the trees were different from
the ones I’d known —although an occa-
sional bluegum brought back memories
of other days—and among the scores of
“GeL ready to go astern!”
birds chattering and whistling in the
foliage overhead I failed to hear the
gurgling notes of a magpie, or the musical
racket of leatherheads. Still, the call of
a peewee brought a familiar, if strident,
contribution to the avian chorus. I
crossed a small bridge over a streamlet,
and for a few minutes watched the mur-
muring water pour over a flat rode, drop
down to an uneven bed and go splashing
on to join the lake, on the cold-looking
water of which wild ducks were already
cruising. The only human in a beautiful,
fresh, natural world I found myself, as I
continued on my way, pondering on the
book I had been reading. The characters
in it were inhabitants of Surry Hills
(Sydney); they were pallid and unhealthy
because the narrow lanes of their slums
completely blocked out the glorious
Sydney sunshine. But somehow 1 could
no longer sympathise with them in their
lack of solar-born health. It seemed to
me that anybody too lazy to get out or
bed at half-past six or seven and walk
less than half a mile in order to enjoy
the beautiful, natural surroundings of the
Botanical Gardens jolly well deserved to
be pallid and unhealthy.

filled them. Mat picked one up and

empty, Mat took the full one and walked
out again. He drained it, placed it care-
fully on the ground and we departed.

“Eastern”: John was a careful man.
Years ago he had lost two sheep through
a delayed branding, but the mishap would
never occur again. Everything from his
Hereford bull to his latest packet of
smokes carried his monicker, and all
stock bought were branded before leaving
the saleyards. Came news from the dis-
trict hospital that the missus had pre-
sented him with a son. Congratulations
showered in, and two days later Sam
met the new parent riding towards town.
“Going in to meet the heir?” g r ‘
Sam. “Gripes, whatcha taking this for?
He pointed to the sheep-brand dangling
from the other’s saddle. “Well, I been
readin’ in the paper,” drawled John,
“where a coupla kids got mixed in hos-
pital, an’ the wrong mothers got ’em,
so ” “But, cripes, the nurse wouldn t
let y’ brand him!” remonstrated Sam.
“She won’t know till after,” John ex-
plained slyly. “Man’s got t pertect his
own, ain’t he? They keep the kids in
little bunks in another room, an’ I’ll get
her t’ show me which’s mine, then send
’er out f’r somethin’, see?” “But, blast
it,” Sam argued righteously, “it amt

set stubbornly. “Just the same, it s goin

“Gravelsnatcher”: Stand aside, you
blokes. I’m coming in again. You can
see the pennies on the kip—one head and
one tail. Now they’re up, spinning nicely.
While they’re aloft let me explain.
“Nubis” says (B. 18/8/’4B) “ventrilo-
quism, like sleight-of-hand and water-
divining, is just a confidence trick.” I’m
one of those coves who gaze, open-
mouthed, while a conjuror plucks lighted
cigarettes out of the air, and I ve taken
it for granted that the bellbird which
fooled me as to its locality possessed
some faculty that I lacked. I’ve never
studied these points. But “Nubis” is tres-
passing on my territory when he libels
water-divining. I’ve chased that elusive
faculty all over the West, and along both
arms and into the brain of some
“diviners” who are so sure of their
ability that they’ll bet on it. And I’m
mystified. The one salient point is that
a big proportion of my fellow-men can
exercise some power by means of which
a forked twig will bend and point towards
the earth. That movement of the twig
can be arrested only by the application
of considerable force. I know, hav-
ing applied that force. The last time I
was in the ring one of you side-betters
—the chap from Queensland, I think it
was —barred my spin on the ground that
if the twig were nearly severed at some
point it should break, but wouldn’t. I
retired to conduct the experiment and
came back with a broken twig; but
another bloke was having a run of heads
and I couldn’t get set. This is my first
toss since then, and the pennies are com-
ing down. You can bar them if you
want to, but make the bar honest. This

“Salmon Gums”; With the approach
of the September equinox, Perth house-
holders are checking over their roofs and
generally battening down in preparation
for the coming storms ; what time a
“I'll shift her a little , Bill —those buckets can hold a bit more yet.”
“daily” with a penchant for answering
queries is assuring an inquirer that
equinoctial gales, as such, just don t
occur. It may be right. The point
has been argued more or less learnedly
by those who should know, and science
apparently refuses to attach any particu-
larly stormy significance to the equinox.
Nevertheless, this season is invariably a
gusty one for Perth. As the wind-belts
of the earth, travelling west to east, move
with the sun, the Roaring Forties,
which normally operate below the Bight,
race across the sou’-west corner of the
big State. They come at the same time
each year, and, reaching hurricane force,
bring an annual harvest for plumbers.
So Perth calls them equinoctial gales,
conveniently forgetting that the March
equinox is completely free from storms.
But science is futile against popular con-
ception. Perth will continue to expect,
and receive, its equinoctial gales.

“Ex-Bluenose”: Don’t confuse the
cuttlefish with the squid, nor with the
octopus; the three being distinct and
different species of the Cephalopoda.
The two firstmentioned have 10 tentacles
as distinct from the octo’s eight, but
there is a bigger difference between them.
With the cuttlefish eight of the arms are
comparatively short and serve largely to
hold the prey while the creature eats.
Two are much longer, quite double the
length, and have the power to shoot for-
ward and grab. Also, they have the
faculty of fastening on to rocks and other
objects, thus enabling the cuttle to traverse
the seabed. The octopus, with its eight
tentacles, can, of course, also do this and
with even greater facility. But such
ground-travel is denied the squid; de-
spite its 10 arms, it can only swim. Also,
all of its tentacles are much the same
length—and a considerable length, com-
pared to its slender body. It is the
squid that is given credit for battling tor
its fife against whales and sharks. Just
how large this species grows has never
been definitely determined. Thousands
of small size are caught annually; they
are used as bait on the Newfoundland
banks. The late Prince of Monaco, a
deep-sea scientist of repute, it
not impossible that squid existed with
bodies as big as a Pullman car. These,
armed with claws in addition to enor-
mous suckers, were, he asserted, able to
put up a stiff defence against both whales
and the largest sharks.

“Bardie”: He was the son of a pros-
perous and well-known cattleman, but the
business had gone to blazes since the old
man died. The others had got in for their
shares, leaving Fred the half-cleared selec-
tion, wild with blackberries and fern,
the wide and wilder expanse of mountain-
grazing leases and a few scrubby Here-
fords. He never quite got over it. Fred
had run to seed early on this account —m
his middle thirties he was paunchy, his
face grizzled. He lived, somehow or
other, with his dogs in the old weather-
board cottage on the place. Astride any
one of the brokendown hacks he hai-
bored, stitching of the saddle burst and
the bridle ornamented with tiewire fasten-
ings, Fred looked what he was: a self-
made wreck. Being young and new to the
district I was impressed by Fred’s yarns

hearted attempts to dig it out, and was

“Zake”: The abo. stockman had a
fence-post between his shoulder-blades,
and with a blissful look on his dial was
propelling himself up and down. “Dont
be a dope, Flourbag,” said Joe the cook.
“You’ll never kill a flea that way take
yer shirt orf an’ get ’im!” flourbag
looked at the bab. disdainfully. Who

“Esk D.”: Widgee and Gongalong
turned on a furious football final, which
the Gongs won by a point just on the
bell. That point was in dispute among
Widgee supporters, and they were itching
to tear the umpires apart and go for their
conquerors with docks, umbrellas and
bottles. Pinchgut, the wowser secretary
of the Progress Association, heard the
uproar in Gongalong pub late that night
and sought his J.P. pal. ‘Things are
gettin’ pretty lively at the hotel, he
complained. “The constable ought to
raid that place more often. There 11 he
a terrific brawl there soon if he doesnt
clear them out; anyway, those goings-on
aren’t lawful. We’d better see him about
shiftin’ ’em.” The Jay pee, who d have
been at the pub himself but for the
watchful eye of his missus, smiled sadly.
“Lucky the John knows better,” he said.
“There might’ve been a dozen stoushes
by this. An’ leavin’ the boozer stay open
keeps the mob t’gether. He’s been down
there since the game ended threatenm t
dong the first cove who talks fight. there
won’t be any serious trouble while weve
got a bloke like him.” #
“Fang” * A couple of buck hares, in
dispute over a female partner, sometimes
provide the spectacle of a rare old dust
up. The contest is something like a box
ing show under Rafferty rules the most
telling blows being landed with the
feet. Bits of fur fly as they spring about
and roll into each other with aTury un-
usual to their kind. Hares often run m
threes on the plains, friendly enough i
their gambolling and play, but 1
dundant member to marital arrangement
is banished at the appropriate time
Bunny, too, goes in for a bit ofstous
at times, the bucks tearing into each other
savagely for harem rights of a particular
warren.
CASUALTY.
Out in the bay I hear the guns
And loud and long their thunder runs
While all along the trembling ground
Beats deep the pulse of heavy sound.
Within their cage the lovebirds grey
Tilt their wise heads in their keen way,
Perched still, as if in thought most wise,
Noting the thunder in the skies.
Then cease the guns their thundering row;
And in their box the lovebirds now,
As if with hurried, angry zest,
Throw out their frail eggs from their nest,
VICTORIA.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
“DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS.”
Blowfly Control.
“K.W.R.”: At field days in
the Charleville and Cunnamulla
areas (Q.), George Moule, sheep-
and wool-expert, emphasised the
importance of fly-control in in-
creasing wool production.
Figures quoted showed differ-
ences as high as 14oz. of greasy
wool between fleeces cut from
unstruck Mulesed ewes .and
struck untreated sheep of the
same age and breeding and run
in the same paddock.
from lower cuts per head there
were more stained pieces and
more tender fleeces among wool
shorn from untreated sheep,
A marked difference in the
number of ewes rearing lambs
through to marking-time was
observed in Mulesed flocks, and
it was obvious that ewes which
were repeatedly struck were less
likely to rear lambs than those
not worried by flies.
Moule says lamb-marking
needs more attention. The way
in which the tail is cut influences
susceptibility of the sheep to
crutch- and tail-strike for the rest
of its life. It is imperative to
turn the undersurface bare skin
of the tail back over the severed
stump and to be particular about
tail length. As the knife is
placed on the tail for docking
the operator should press the
skin upward with the edge of
the blade towards the butt of
the tail. Immediately the tail is
severed the skin thus pushed up
will move down and cover the
stump.
Dogs and Sheep.
“Medium 64”; Dogs certainly
frighten the sheep, and dog-
hunted sheep cannot do well (B.
25/8/’4B). Tve worked sheep
for nearly 50 years without dog
aid, have mustered a 5000-acre
paddock with 1800 ewes and
lambs, and drove them five miles
through two gates, singlehanded,
in half a day. The secret is to
take them steadily and quietly,
never making a noise unless
absolutely necessary. To turn
a wing in the paddock, throw a
stick sft. to 10ft. wide of the
leaders and then yell “back” as
the stick hits the ground. This
repeated a few times will teach
them to obey the sound of the
voice, without the stick-throw-
ing.
I’m not impressed by tales of
the wondrous work of dogs.
Mostly they run the sheep about
and kick up dust, and heaven
knows what we lose through
dusty wool. Break-in the sheep,
which aren’t so much stupid as
timid, and they can be handled
quite well without a dog on the
place.
Tomato Seed.
“Hortus”: All growers
should select their own. This
assures that they are getting
varieties true to type and are
gradually improving the variety
and yield of the crop by repro-
ducing only outstandingly good
plants.
The right time to select the
plantsi is just before the first
fruit is picked. At this stage
one can estimate the earliness
of the tomato.
Select plants showing medium-
sized bunches of even-sized and
well-shaped fruit. Look at the
bottom bunches, the most
profitable. Don’t pick plants
with fairly large bunches of ill-
shaped fruit in preference to
medium-shaped bunches of well-
shaped fruit. Then look at the
second and third clusters of
fruit. See that they are well
pollinated and that the swelling
fruit is of good shape and size.
These clusters should be rela-
tively close together on the
stem. If they are far apart don’t
select the plant; it is not an
ideal fruiter.
Look particularly at the top
of the bush. See that the
bunches of flowers are well
spread and healthy. By them
you can obtain a very fair idea
of the yielding features on the
top of the plant. The best
marketing proposition is a four-
to - six - fruit - per - pound type.
Taking varieties like Red
Marhio and Break o’ Day, select
plants showing bunches of six
to eight fruit of medium size.
Don’t be led astray by bunches
of three or four very large fruit.
Like normally breeds like, and
people don’t choose large toma-
toes for general domestic pur-
poses.
It is not wise to take the bot-
tom bunches of fruit for seed
purposes. They contain little
seed compared with fruit on the
top of the bush.
When you have selected the
good specimens leave the fruit
on the plant until it is over-
ripe. Then pick it, cut it into
halves and squeeze the seed-
pulp into a basin. After three
or four days’ fermentation wash
the mass thoroughly in water
several times and dry in the sun.
Make sure selected plants have
no disease.
Checking Orchard Erosion.
“Sundowner”: P. Everett, a
N.Z. orchard-instructor, sug-
gests maintenance of soil
organic matter at a high level
by growing the full amount of
annual cover - crop during
autumn and winter; during the
season when inadequate soil
moisture is likely to occur cul-
tivate only sufficiently to obtain
reasonable weed-control. Ridges
left by cultivation should be
across the slope §o that they
“It must be spring again .”
under the spread of trees. Re-
cultivate such pasture every
second or third year. Mow at
frequent intervals where soil
moisture is likely to be inade-
quate to minimise loss by trans-
piration. Alternate mowings
could be used as a mulch under
the trees.
Bees Swarming.
“Bumble”: The trait which
serves for natural increase in the
wild state is a drawback in
keeping bees for honey, since a
colony split into two or more
parts in a season can’t produce
nearly the same amount as a
hive crammed with bees. Brood-
rearing is done in the hives at a
high rate in early spring, and
the colonies rapidly build up to
that recognisable state when
they are ripe for swarming.
Supersedure is often combined
with swarming, when the issue
dam the water on to the area,
increasing the time for absorp-
tion. Leave the surface some-
what cloddy.
Break long slopes into shorter
sections by low banks or sur-
face drains at intervals on care-
fully-surveyed lines, providing
for a very gentle face so that
excess water is led to drainage-
ways without causing erosion.
Where possible such drainage-
ways should be on headlands.
Where excess water must be led
down the slope through a por-
tion of the orchard, grassing the
lower part of the drainage chan-
nels is necessary to prevent
gullying.
Where the slope is too steep
for these methods, and on lesser
slopes where the soil type is ex-
tremely erodable, it may be ad-
vantageous to sow alternate
alleyways with a semi-perman-
ent pasture, or the whole area
may be sown except for circles
and the parent colony are pro-
vided with young, unmated
queens; in other cases the lay-
ing queen leaves with the first
swarm and a virgin remains at
the hive. Besides the loss of
bees in the exodus there is a
delay of more than a week be-
fore the new queen is laying,
and a further decline in th©
number of bees, so that a
swarmed-out hive can do little
better than maintain itself till
the following season.
Factors in swarming are
overcrowding in the hive, an
aged or failing queen, a large
quota of drones and the degree
to which the tendency is mani-
fest in the particular strain of
bees. Some strains will swarm
at the first opportunity, while
others hold off till conditions
almost compel them to swarm.
The apiary strain should there-
fore be built up from that of
certain colonies with subdued
swarming instincts, provided
that all other qualities are de-
sirable. Requeening with
young, virile queens at regular
intervals does away with the
growing impulse to swarm with
supersedure as queens become
old and weaken in their egg-
laying. With proper control and
the right strain of bees there
should be no swarming with a
first-season queen.
Engine Bearings.
“Radian”; The connecting-
rod big-end is the hardest-
worked bearing in the engine,
and usually the first to require
attention.
In spark-ignition engines a
loose big-end can be readily de-
tected by the knock, which
rapidly becomes worse if let go.
Detection is harder in compres-
sion-ignition engines because of
the normal ignition knock,
which, under certain conditions,
is easy to confuse with bearing
noise. Any strange sounds
should be investigated at once.
A loose fly-wheel can cause a
most alarming knock.
In small engines big-end play
can be checked by hand. Grasp
the rod firmly and force the big-
end up and down on the shaft
If really loose a distinct knock
can be heard at the limit of
each movement, and definite
lift can be seen with the naked
eye. Bearings that are only
slightly loose will not knock,
but will emit a distinct squelch
as oil is forced from between
big-end and shaft. A big-end
in good order will move easily
from side to side, but no up-
and-down play can be felt by
hand.
In larger engines, with
heavier moving parts, a pinch-
bar or piece of timber should be
used to check for excess play in
bearings. Many engines leave
the factory with a number of
shims of varying thicknesses
spaced evenly in each side of the
big-end. Others, particularly
some leading diesels, have steel-
backed bearings lined with a
thin layer of high-quality white
metal, and shims are not used.
If play develops in this type of
big-end a new pair of liners
should be fitted rather than
attempting to refit the original
bearing.
On the shimmed bearing the
shims are not hard to adjust.
Before dismantling the big-end,
check to see if both halves: are
marked so that it can be re-
placed the same way as it came
apart. When dismantled check
the white-metal bearing-surfaces
for cracks and scars. If damaged,
they should be replaced or the

THE NEW LIQUID SHEEP DIP
incorporating “ Gammexant” Btn%eru Htxacblonit,
Containing the most effective isecti-
cide discovered for the purpose,
GAMALENE is a POSITIVE des-
troyer of keds (sheep ticks), body lice,
foot lice and blowflies. It remains
active in the wool long enough to
ensure the destruction of any eggs or
pupae which may not be eradicated at
the time of dipping.
Its high concentration means that 2\
gallons of GAMALENE will do the
same work for which at least 5 gallons
of ordinary liquid dip, or 100 lbs. of
powder dip, are required.
GAMALENE is one of the simplest
of all dips to use, and possesses many
remarkable features which must recom-
mend it to every sheep owner.
GAMALENE is a stable emulsion easy to pour and requires
no premixing before use.
Contains no ingredients of an acid or caustic nature, no
mineral oils or solvents and cannot injure the wool.
Is retained in the wool after dipping, and is not washed out
by rain.
Highly concentrated, 2| gallons of GAMALENE are
sufficient for 1000 gallons of wash.
Sickle Brand GAMALENE is packed in 10 pint tins—two per carton. One carton (2J gallons) is
sufficient to make 1000 gallons of wash.

big-end bolts for signs of strain,
particularly at the ends of the
threads, and if doubtful replace
them with correct bolts for your
particular engine don’t use
ordinary mild-steel bolts on any
account.
To adjust, wipe bearing and
shaft free of grit and oil, then,
using good judgment, remove
enough shims to take up the
play. This is a matter of trial
and error, but it is possible to
guess at the correct number of
shims for a try-out. The bear-
ing should then be tightened on
the shaft and checked. When
adjusted correctly the bearing
should just “feel” the shaft, yet
should move easily from side to
side when struck a glancing
blow with the palm of the hand.
This method of testing is: satis-
factory for small engines, but
not accurate enough for those
having a crank-pin diameter
greater than 3in.
Frost-prevention.
“J. Frost”: Standing cover-
crops and weeds shade soil and
dry it out, whilst cover-crops also
form channels (in which vines
stand) to collect cold stagnant
air (B. 1/9/’4B). They also raise
the level of cold air to the top
of the cover-crop and near vul-
nerable vine-shoots.
It is now believed that on a
frosty night, when all surfaces
are radiating heat, parts of plants
have some of their losses made
up from heat being radiated
from near-by warmer soil. When
soil-heat reserves are exhausted
plant losses are not offset.
Unless wind or cloud intervenes
in time, damage ensues.
Up to two degrees are hoped
for by heat - conservation
methods. Oil-heating will give
another three to five degrees.
Wind machines, useful in some
situations, are treated with re-
serve by American authorities.
Latest heating devices use infra-
red heat supplied either electri-
cally or by oil heaters. Both use
reflectors to direct the heat
downwards to the plants.
Experiments show that frost
susceptibility of plants is in-
creased by trace-element defi-
ciencies. Bud-burst may be de-
layed up to six weeks by hor-
mones, some of which will assist
in setting frost-damaged fruitlets.
While a grower has not much
defence except oil - heating
against a severe frost, at least
in spring and autumn, whether
he irrigates or not, he can avoid
becoming an accessory to the
crime.
Mallee Fallows.
“Nedrium”: Mallee bare
fallows have always been a
trouble because of the tendency
to soil-drift and blowing. Yet
these fallows are nec'essary for
successful wheatgrowing to
conserve moisture, to starve out
insect pests and fungus diseases
and to build up soil-fertility.
How to do these things without
leaving bare soil that will blow
is the problem, and such second-
ary measures as windbreaks are
no real answer. Perhaps the
solution is not far distant.
Vic. School of Agriculture is
experimenting. with drought-re-
sistant field-peas to sow in the
Malice rotation. Selection of
the best types for the drier areas
is well under way ; the aim being
to provide a “living label,” as
the geneticist calls it, for the
right type of pea. By careful
crossing, the scientists are trying
to combine the field-pea with
the desirable features with yellow
flowers —its distinguishing label.
After this has been done —a
difficult business —and this strain
multiplied, it will be an easy
matter to pick out the drought-
resistant pea from any others.
In genetical terms, the genes for
the desirable features will be
linked with the gene for yellow
flowers in the chromosome
make-up. “Living-label” peas
will increase soil-fertility for the
subsequent wheat crop, while
holding the soil.
Hints for the Farm.
“Bill C.”: Skins are safe from
weevils only if treated with
arsenic-soda wash. This highly-
poisonous liquid should be kept
in a labelled bottle well out of
the way of children. Further-
more, flat tins used to hold the
wash while treating the skins
should be buried afterward.
Stock seem attracted by the
“salty” stuff,
“Sarina”: Dead trees do little
to check soil erosion and can
be a nuisance. When they stand
in an area that has to be burned
off every year or two to make
a firebreak they are apt to catch
fire and throw sparks into the
dry grass beyond the burned
area. Seldom do dead trees in
an awkward position succumb
to fire. On the contrary, they
stand for years, though they
burn superficially with every fire
and are highly dangerous. Cut
them down for firewood.
“Gem”: To waterproof con-
crete without discoloring the
surface, go over the rough sur-
face before rendering with a
mixture of four to one ordinary ■
clay and cement. It needs to be
mixed well and fairly wet, and
trowelled on about iin. thick.
After about two weeks it will
have dried hard and be ready
to take a final rendering.
“Nubis”: To test soil for
acidity, place a sample in a glass
container, using a trowel.
Thoroughly wet the sample,
make a slit in it with a knife,
and insert a piece of blue litmus-
paper (obtainable from a
chemist). Press the soil against
the paper, leave for an hour, then
remove. If the paper is now
pink, the soil is acid. Excess
acidity can be counteracted by
topdressing with lime.
“Myrrhee”: To keep a lawn
at its best, give it at least four
manurial dressings a year at
three-monthly intervals (quan-
tities in pounds per 100 square
yards): September, sulphate of
ammonia, 411 b., sulphate of
iron Ulb.; December, sulphate
of ammonia 4jlb,; March,
super. 31b., sulphate of ammonia
4ilb., sulphate of iron l?lb.;
June, sulphate of ammonia 4ilb,
“Graz”: The old axiom that
half the breed goes down the
neck was borne out at Wapeelah,
Bourke (N.S.W.), this season
when 8776 wethers averaged
mb. 12oz. of wool per head.
As a counter to higher shearing,
freight and production costs,
growers will find it pays better
to have 700 well-fed wethers
averaging 111 b. (total 77001 b.)
than 1000 half-starved sheep cut-
ting only 7|lb. or a total of
75001 b.
“Plane Creek”: I have had to
snare, shoot and poison walla-
bies to save my crops from de-
struction, and at first I thought
the skins, quoted at up to 7s. per
pound, would make me a small
fortune. But the best I could
average was Is. a skin, even
though I went to endless trouble
pegging them out the right way,
cleaning all blood off them,
trimming, etc. I did better sell-
ing the scalps, for all were worth
a shilling each, whereas some
small skins only fetched 3d. and
6d. apiece.

Eisteddfod Echoes.
The first Eisteddfod con-
ducted by the A.L.P., in which
entries were confined to members
of the Federal Parliamentary
Labor party, had been eminently
successful. Canberra had simply
rocked with the display of talent.
The Prime Minister had
entered in two sections. His
comic recitation; “I Believe In
Crawling Before I Run,” given
with actions in front of a dummy
Communist, brought the House
down. His song, “The Golden
Age,” to an accompaniment of
“raspberries” off-stage, was quite
a vocal feat, as he rendered it
with his tongue held in his cheek.
Maxie Falstein gave an im-
passioned interpretation of the
grand old ballad, “Votch, Vot
of the Nightman?” His acci-
dental swallowing of a main-
spring and a couple of easements
just before he went on to the
platform greatly improved his
delivery.
Carrying a framed portrait of
Big Charlie, Leslie Haylen, with
tears in his voice, cracked the
welkin with the Gilsullivan air,
“A More Humane Mikado

“Thick or thin?”
also accompanied himself on the
fiddle, which he played at sight
from one of the new electoral
redistribution maps, in “I Hope
to Scrape In Like I Did Before.”
Senator Amour had been next.
As a tribute to the Opposition
members who alleged that he had
been in a fight in a plane, and
had been rendered hors de com-
bat, he sang with great feeling
the current hit-tune: “The
Dicky-Bird Song.”
P.M.G. Don Cameron had
been in fine 'form with his two
numbers. His .first was: “I
Drool and I Dribble,” given with
suitable actions; the second,
sung while holding an imaginary
telephone in one hand and a
wrong number in the other, was:
“Have You Ever Seen a Dial
Like This?”
Doc. Evatt’s extended holiday
overseas hadn’t debarred him
from entering. As well as a
signed nomination form for the
Federal elections in case the fish
were still biting well at Lake
Geneva around next September,
the Doc. had left with the party
managers, before departing, a
record of the duet he’d made
with himself, with trumpet obbli-
gato also by himself —the
thought of anyone else blowing
his trumpet had been unthink-
able to Bert. The duet consisted
of two separate songs blended
into one; “I Love Me” and “I’m
a Stranger Round These Parts.”
An encore which he had also
left in anticipation wasn’t used.
The member for Martin ren-
dered in swing-time his number,
“I’m Known As a Daly,
I’m Really a Weakly.”
Dan Mulcahy’s epic “Shure,
An’ Oi’rn Ahlways Shlingin’
Mud,” was heard in deep silence.
Eddie Ward had revealed a
voice of splintered timbre in his
special song “You Dirty Liar,”
which was given with typewriter
obbligato by Bill Urquhart.
The Minister for the Army
had the support of the Eastern
Fatigue Party Band in his sing-
ing of an air from “The Choco-
late Soldier.” As a kettledrum
solo he gave “We’ve Seven
Colonels Now to Every Private.”
After having hadva prepara-
tory gargle with one of the
Government’s free - formulary
prescriptions. Senator McKenna
had had to wait half an hour to
get his voice back. Then in a
coloratura basso he let fly with
the aria, “I Can’t Even Give It
Away.”.
A fervently-delivered mono-
logue, “How I Won With a
Royal Routine,” by Senator
Armstrong brought loud cheers
from himself at its conclusion.
In the choral section the entire
party had combined to give
spirited renditions of “The Face
On the Bar-room Floor,” “Our
Screws Have Been Expanded,
But Who Cares About Rheu-
matics?” and “We’re Always
Chasing Rainbows.”
The competitors had been
hanging around waiting for the
results when someone came up
and gloomily announced that
Caucus had just decided to
nationalise all Eisteddfods and
had recommended to Cabinet
that, in view of the necessity to
build up the Public Service be-
fore the elections, bills be intro-
duced so that a board could be
formed to take over all cultural
competition activities.
“Well,” quavered Don Camer-
on, who hadn’t liked his own
chances, anyway, “we might as
well wait and put our own under
it. Under a nationalised
Eisteddfod nobody can win!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Trees in History
A move is afoot in England—among
people who think such things are im-
portant in the durability of a civilisa-
tion —to bring together in one central
place trees directly descended from trees
which have played interesting or even
important parts in British history. Lord
Jersey offered a site at Ostesley Park, and
the collection of suitable young trees was
under way whlen the war brought the
whole thing to a standstill. It is now
being taken up again.
The idea originated with Sir Stephen
Tallents, after he had been presented
with a young willow directly descended
from one of the willows on St. Helena
under which Napoleon was buried. In
a 8.8. C, talk he described how “that
kindly gift added a graceful tree to the
banks of the little river which moats
my garden. It also gave me an idea.
How interesting it would be to get to-
gether in some open place, readily acces-
sible to the public, a garden of trees
and plants made famous by their his-
torical associations.”
Among the trees in sight for the park
there was a sapling descended from the
Boscobel Oak, in which Charles II hid
after the battle of Worcester; a tiny
cypress descended from the wreath on
the gun-carriage which took the body of
the Duke of Wellington to his funeral;
another cypress descended from those
under which Sappho “loved and sung” in
Lesbos; yet another from Shelley’s grave
in Italy.
In our own land, where few tears are
shed when a fine old cedar is destroyed,
but where trees and the absence of them
are important elements in our social
economy, there might well be room for
some experiment along the English lines.
Certainly no effort aimed at bringing
people who live only in the present into
closer touch with important influences
of their past would be wasted. And
trees, with their own beauty as the bridge,
have a special way of taking men’s minds
away from the immediacies of life into a
wider field where the spirit of the race
may find expression. We in Australia
often have too little sense of that spirit.
Trees naturally have played colorful
roles in the history of Australia. At once
there come to mind the Hovell tree on
the banks of the Murray at Albury; the
Burke and Wills tree on the Cooper ; the
trees marked by Blaxland, Lawson and
Wentworth in their conquest of the Blue
Mountains. A tree figured prominently
in the establishment of South Australia,
and Vaucluse House, near Sydney, has
something to offer which traces directly
to one of Australia’s first'great nation-
alists, William Charles Wentworth.—
W. D. (N.S.W.).
Red Cedar
Both the Queensland and N. S. Wales
Forestry Departments missed out on re-
planting red cedar (B. 11/8/’4B). The
tree can be grown, but the Forestry
people tried to grow it in stands. Red
cedar doesn’t grow in that way—even
a small clump is rare. When planted
in stands the young trees become the
victims of a massed pest attack, and that
led the Forestry Departments of both
States to give out: “Unfortunately,
all arboricultural tests with this species
of tree have failed owing to the ravages
of twig-borers.”
Yet, at the same time, the tree which
“couldn’t” be grown was regenerating
naturally as single trees all through the
forests. The Forestry people were blind
to that obvious lesson, though observant
men among the felling gangs could see
it.
Experiments made by one. of these
practical men showed the way to per-
petuate red cedar. Whenever a selected
timber tree is felled, such as a kauri, black
walnut, maple, etc., it leaves a gap in the
forest. Natural regeneration may put one
or two trees of a valuable species there,
but usually there is only a growth of
rubbish. If a young cedar is planted
and the rubbish slashed down around it
for a year or two it soon becomes a
vigorous youngster. Growing upward
towards the gap in the foliage overhead
gives it a very straight and clean trunk.
In 30 years it is big enough to cut; at
40 years it may be as much as 7ft. in
girth, and, growing as an isolated tree, it
is not the victim of a massed borer attack.
Around Kerai, on the Atherton Table-
land, there has been a particularly good
natural regeneration of young red cedars.
In one place they all have one thing in
common —each grows by the stump of a
tree which was felled years previously.
They were put there by an old tree-lover
who did it in his own time.
But we need not go short of red cedar
while waiting for Forestry Departments
to start planting. In New Guinea and
New Britain the same tree is found
scattered through the rain forests. Grown
on the lowlands, it produces a timber
paler and coarser in grain than that in
Australia, but on the highlands you can t
tell the two apart. The labor of getting
out logs, either in N.G. or N. 8., would
be no greater with modem tractors than
that faced by the old Australian cedar-
getter with his bullock team, except, of
course, that we have to contend with
Eddie Ward.—Ex-R.S.M. (S.A.).
Public Health
Recent disclosures have shown up the
shocking conditions that exist in many
Government institutions, allegedly for the
good of the public health.
After much outcry, the N.S.W. Public
Service Board has reported that there is
overcrowding in practically all State
mental institutions. Even in the under-
statement published by the board, it is
clear that many other conditions are un-
satisfactory. Food, while plentiful, is
not good, and there are staff shortages,
particularly of female nurses. Also,
“every effort should be made, notwith-
standing inherent difficulties, to ensure a
“I say—cant We have a little privacy?
tidier appearance of inmates, and over-
coats should be made an official issue.”
The t.b. situation was summed up by a
Sydney specialist: “Probably half the
people with advanced t.b. who are wait-
ing for admission to hospital die before
they get there.” Here again there is a
shortage of staff, followed automatically
by a shortage of beds. The atmosphere
in hospitals and sanatoria is depressing,
and most t.b. institutions suffer by being
too remote from the city.
Yet, with conditions such as these pre-
vailing, the Government can spend time,
thought and money on schemes like “free”
medicine. A queer way, surely, of guard-
ing the physical welfare of the public, —
B. P. D. (N.S.W.).
Challenge to Hanlon
N.Q. “Register,” having heard Queens-
land Premier Hanlon promise North
Queensland a new State when the area’s
“economic and financial stability per-
mits,” a condition which Mr. Hanlon
swore to bring about by his own Govern-
ment’s efforts, wonders what he is wait-
ing for:
If the State Government thinks so highly
of the north, let it take steps during the
Parliamentary session that has now com-
menced to demand that the Federal Gov-
ernment .... establish a wool-store at Towns-
ville a tropical division of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research, and
a taxation bureau for North Queensland,
and great financial and material aid to
speed up the building of the Burdekin
Dam.
Mr. Hanlon’s Government can, without
support from the Commonwealth, estab-
lish a university college in North Queens-
land; improve our technical-training facili-
ties; implement genuine decentralisation of
Government departments; establish a tropi-
cal branch of the Agriculture Department,
and, without loss of time, give the firm
that intends to erect a cement works in the
■ north the backing to allow it to commence
building operations this year, not four years
hence, as promised, and make an immedi-
ate start to establish the abattoir to be a
feature of a Bill to come before Parlia-
ment this session.
The trouble with these northerners is that
that know what they want and are deter-
mined to get it —if they have to secede
from Brisbane to do so, — Balander (Q.).
Co-operative Wheat-selling
Surveying the general mess of what
Scully and Pollard have made of wheat,
growers, with an uneasy feeling that
they’ve been got at somewhere, are
beginning to wonder whether they
couldn’t handle the stuff better them-
selves. In N.S.W., where, somewhat to
their surprise, they are to be given a
chance to vote on the latest Pollard “stabi-
lisation” scheme, wheatmen are practically
ready to take over their own marketing.
There is tremendous dissatisfaction
with the Australian Wheat Board while
subject to Ministerial dictation, and with
the general attitude of Mr. Pollard. The
notorious N.Z. wheat deal and the sign-
ing -of the now-defunct International
Wheat Agreement, with concessional sales
to India and Britain under which growers,
and not the contracting Government, had
to make the monetary sacrifice, all contri-
buted to the general feelihg of revolt.
On top of all this, when the Federal
Government was asked for a stabilisation
plan after the Prices Referendum, all it
could produce was jthe new Pollard plan,
which is nothing more than an “equalisa-
tion” scheme.
Growers feel that concessional sales,
both for home consumption and export,
have lost them £7O million in the last
few years,’which is why they are taking
the Nelungaloo case on to the Privy
Council.
Recently the N.S.W. Wheatgrowers’
Union president, H. A. Colwill, slated
the Government for not consulting
growers before signing the International
Wheat Agreement —“after all, it
is our wheat and we should at
least have a voice in any agree-
ment regarding its disposal”—
and it was then that the first
move towards co - operative
marketing occurred. The union
decided to explore the possibili-
ties of the co-op. idea, and im-
mediately appointed a committee
of five to “investigate and report
on the possibilities of buying and
selling wheat through producers’
co-operative societies.”
The committee’s report will be
awaited with interest, since it
may well become the first move
in a huge grower-controlled
marketing scheme. Wheatmen
emphasise that the time to in-
augurate such a plan is when
prices are high, the industry
prosperous and farmers in a
financial position to launch such
a project.
Three weeks after the union
conference the N.S.W. Farmers
and Settlers’ Association ex-'
pressed the same dissatisfaction
with Government handling of
wheat, and the delegates decided
to sponsor a movement aiming
at producer ownership of the
N.S.W. silo system. “In W.A.
farmers own the system and paid for it
by a small levy on the wheat. Their
system is working well and N.S.W.
farmers should follow their example,”
said one. And a motion from Narromine
that the association see the Department of
Agriculture about evolving an economic
system of handling wheat in bulk from
“header to mill” brought this comment
from the president, H. S. Roberton: “The
breakdown of the present system is a
challenge to the ingenuity of the wheat-
farmers, and they should do the job, not
the department.” — Jonean (N.S.W.).
Farmer and Hand
Before “C.L.” denounces farmworkers
for their attitude towards the boss (B.
18/8/’4B), he should recall the time —
just before the war, too —when there was
a surplus of labor.
I was humping the bluey myself then.
Work was scarce, but occasionally I
came across a benevolent cocky who
didn’t want a man but who would stretch
a point and dig up something for me to
do. Of course, one couldn’t expect a
decent wage under such circumstances —
nor was it offered. At times it was as
low as a pound a week and tucker. But
then, the farmer was just helping me. If
I didn’t see fit to accept his hospitality,
it made no difference to him.
And the work? Strange where those
cockies could dig it all up, seeing that
they didn’t really require a man. There
was always sufficient to keep one going
from daylight till dark, fencing, splitting,
woodcutting, ploughing, milking and a
few odd jobs for Sunday, too.
Is it any wonder that there was a drift
of workers from the farms to the cities
and towns as soon as better jobs offered?
Is it any wonder that those now employed
on farms demand what they want?
I believe in a fair day’s Work for a
fair day’s pay and agree wjith “C.L.”
that the set-up bet\yeen the farmer and
hand is wrong. There should always
be a little give and take between the two
parties, but that grand spirit is, unfor-
tunately, governed by the supply of and
demand for labor. When men are plenti-
ful the cocky wields the big stick ; when
they are scarce the boot is on the other
foot. —L. P. (Vic.).
The Gatton Spirit
Angus and Robertson, the Sydney pub-
lishers, have got together the papers and
criticisms read and uttered at an Austra-
lian Institute of Political Science meeting
at Armidale (N.S.W.) and published them
in book form under the title “Decentra-
lization.” The book will make good
reading in the country, especially in parts
like New England, North Queensland
and Riverina, where the New-State Move-
ment is revived and attracting attention.
What it serves to show is that, for the
most part, the eminent lecturers and their
more-or-less eminent critics seem to want
to agree with the notion that decen-
tralisation is desirable, but what with
delving into Constitutional matters, birth-
rates, industrial problems, politics, public
finance, State indebtedness, uniform taxa-
tion and other things, only two of the
gentlemen concerned expressed any. sign
of a passionate conviction that new States
offer to the non-urban areas of the
country any hope of lifting themselves
from, the stagnation into which political
disinterest and Big-City domination have
cast them.
The plain truth is that the evidence
of stagnation is there, stark and undis-
guised, not in any way contradicted by
odd, isolated incidents of some town or
other having a biscuit-factory or a bottle-
works now which it didn’t have before
the war. Population figures stifle debate
and crush argument, and they show that
ip a continent of nearly 3,000,000 square
miles, practically a third of a population
of a little more than 7,000,000 live in
two cities. Followed further, the figures
reveal that each of the five mainland
State capitals carries a population which,
by weight of numbers, makes it virtually
impossible for distant parts of their States’
to get a fair go. Those same distant
parts, however much they be convinced
of the need for self-government and free-
dom from Big-City domination, will get
nowhere until they begin to follow the
example of Gatton (Q.).
Gatton comprises 3000 people 60 miles
west of Brisbane. Gatton wanted a hos-
pital. The Queensland Government re-
fused to build one. Gatton decided to
build its own. Leading townsmen
pledged themselves to raise £5OOO and
have a hospital built within three months.
The Gatton spirit is wanted to fire the
new-State movements. — Norther (Q.).
Using the Snowy River
When politicians smell votes all their
professions of national vision melt into
factious words. A bunch of the N.S.W.
variety, 28 no less, invaded the old
Riverina town of Narrandera the other
week and assured a “monster rally”
called by the Murrumbidgee Valley Water
Users’ Association that only over their
dead bodies, so to speak, would anybody
divert the Snowy River anywhere else but
into the ’Bidgee. “The Snowy is a N.S.W.
river,” declared Sheahan, Sydney Minister
for Lands, “and should be diverted into
the Murrumbidgee without delay.” After
which the meeting “unanimously” re-
solved that it should be so.
There were, said one paper, 22 Labor
and six C.P. members present. Among
the six were Bruxner, leader of the C.P.
in N.S.W., and his deputy, Drummond.
Both “pledged their party’s support” for
the scheme. Where was Drummond’s
vision of New States? Where Bruxner’s
pledge to place national interests above
all?
The Snowy, so far as diversion is con-
cerned, is no more a N.S.W. stream than
is the Tennessee River the sole property of
the American State which bears its name.
The whole Murray valley, of which the
’Bidgee is a part, is a national asset. The
Snowy is separated from the headwaters
of the Murray and the ’Bidgee by moun-
tains, and it flows uselessly through a
corner of N.S.W. and Victoria into the
sea below Orbost. If its waters are to be
saved for hydroelectricity and irrigation,
as they should be, and diverted into the
Murray system, which includes the
’Bidgee, then Victoria, N.S.W. and South
Australia are all equally and vitally in-
terested, and so is the Commonwealth.
For that reason the national welfare
demands that no one section of interested
landholders or parochial State politicians
should be allowed to cloud this diversion
question with “monster rallies” and silly
claims to sole ownership of the river.
Diversion of a powerful stream is a big
and costly business, and the peculiar situa-
tion of the Snowy makes it necessary
that the whole idea be examined*by prac-
tical and impartial men before any scheme
is accepted. And the less heard from
State politicians the better. O. T.
(N.S.W.).

SOME TO
OnE of the ambitions of every housewife is to reign
over a modern kitchen. It is so nice to come
home to something to be proud of and pleasant to
work in.
Nothing contributes more to contented living than
today’s ideal kitchen. Here is a domain where steel’s
strength, versatility and pleasing appearance is at once
apparent. In the hands of industry steel has brought to
reality the plans of architects and engineers for greater
kitchen effectiveness and beauty.
Yes, today’s dream kitchens with their stainless steel
sinks, electric and gas cooking ranges, trouble-free
hot water services, steel-built freezers and refrigerators,
and space-saving steel storage cabinets are far removed
from the days of the hand-turned cooking spit and the
iron pot on the hob.
The use of steel in kitchen furnishings and equipment
provides evidence of the fact that steel can do more jobs
better than any other material.
B.H.P. steel—product of the fusion in the furnaces
at the Newcastle Steel Works of South Australian iron
ore and limestone and New South Wales coal—plays its
part in enabling the Australian housewife to enjoy the
benefits of modern kitchen design.
