Dr. Perry’s Pamphlet on Nervous Diseases:
1 Their Cause, Symptoms, and Treatment.
This pamphlet is specially written to show a method of
counteracting the ill effects of indiscretions in early life,
over-work, mental worry, &c., and contains a fund of use-
ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz : —Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS
DEBILITY, Pains in the Back, Defective Memory, Specks
before the Eyes, Excessive Nervousness, Premature
Decay, Bashfulness, Excessive Heart Palpitation, Des-
pondency, Impure Blood, Liver and Kidney Complaints,
Contagious Diseases, and various other symptoms experi-
enced by Nervous Sufferers.
This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive
benefit from the perusal of this work.
If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing
me a letter detailing in full his symptoms, on receipt of
which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Gmnlee a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of invertigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
become perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.
ALL CONSULTATIONS, either by letter or in person, FREE. Hours of Consultation—From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
daily ; Saturdays, 10 to 12 a.m. ; and from 7to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Address all'letters—

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
aillict mankind.

book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will bo found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
an( i patients may rest assured that their cases
•will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

DR. KELLY'S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.
IP YOU ARE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER YOU REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.

Superfluous Women.
The London Evening Standard, in a recent
issue, is possessed of the seven devils of a
new inspiration. It conceives that Australia
is a favourable held in which to deposit the
surplus women of England, and straightway
it draws up plans and specifications for
exporting the superfluous British female to
these shores, and leaving her there to take
her chance for the future. This idea is
part and parcel of that comprehensive policy
which is summed up in the great Anglo-
Saxon watchword, “ Move on !” When any
single individual in all the three kingdoms
of Great Britain is poor, hungry, homeless,
ragged, diseased, discontented, dirty, or
insane some philanthropist always rises up
with a project for moving him or her on.
The policeman stirs up the shivering vagrant
in the street, and moves him along for his
own good to the next policeman’s beat, and
the next policeman meets him there, and
moves him further on, and so he would pre-
sently be moved right into the North Sea,
only by a special dispensation of Providence
there are gaps between the officers, and the
vagrant gets a chance to dodge in the hiatus
where one policeman ends and the other has
not yet begun. \V hen the Irish famine arose
there arose with it sundry noble-hearted
Christians who, instead of grappling with the
difficulty on the spot, helped to move the
starving peasantry into the United States, and
the best fighting material in the three king-
doms was thus lost to the empire for ever.
The ruined farmers of the Scottish High-
lands have been so effectually moved on to
Canada that very few of that sturdy and
valiant race remain. General Booth, the
Pope with the red shirt and the red nose,
has a scheme for moving the whole of the
ignorant, hopeless, brutish, and utterly
incapable classes of England into Australia
or South Africa or China or Gehenna—it
matters very little where, and the project
has been well received in the British Isles.
And now—as another item in the same plan
the Standard desires that the superfluous
female population of England should be
moved into Australia and left thei’e for our
sympathetic consideration. Every road that
leads from the happy isles of Britain is
trodden hard by the feet of countless
thousands that are always moving on.
* # #
And in every case there is a Paradise just
ahead for the myriads who move on.
Every British philanthropist and newspaper
writer and political economist and Tory
capitalist tells the same story of the fields
of amaranth that will bo reached if the
legion of the lost keeps moving long enough
to make quite sure that it will never, by
any chance, get back. There are schemes
for planting the decayed gentlewomen of
England on the great, scorched, sun-blasted
Avastes of interior Australia, or on the
parched karroos of Southern Africa, or for
depositing broken-down governesses among
the sodden mountains of Central Otago—any
place that is far away is good enough to lie
about in such a connection. And, there-
fore, when the Standard breaks forth like
this, it is fairly in keeping with all the
rest: —
There are thousands of young men want-ins? wives at
this moment in Australia, where there are few wives to
be had. There is a colonial career open to our surplus
female population if they only manage once to get to the
other side of the globe.
We know the kind of women who make up
that “surplus population” which the
Standard desires so much to dispose of.
Out of every thousand females at least two
hundred are ‘ * surplus ” —the oldest and ugliest
two hundred in every case. The elderly,
gaunt governess, with black mittens and
spectacles, the flat chested woman who is no
longer wanted in the factory, the venerable
person with “rheumatics,” the “genteel
spinster” who tries vainly to eke out a pre-
carious existence by embroidery, the helpless
lady who has seen better days, the haggard
boarding-house keeper who is prematurely
old by reason of the unprincipled way the
boarders have escaped by the back window,
thedreary, useless character who keeps a small
shop, the “saved” girl from a “home of hope”
who was reared in an atmosphere of vice,
and can no more shake off the hereditary
taint than she can outlive her own immor-
ality—they are all “surplus,” evei’y one.
The young Australian is alleged to be in
want of a wife, and this gorgon host is
entirely at his service ; the Standard will
cheerfully shunt the whole crowd without a
single exception.
# • •
In Australia and Maoriland, at the present
time, the male population is probably about
250,000 in advance of the female. In most
of the older communities of Europe and
America the female population is consider-
ably ahead, and on this fact the Standard
bases the assumption that there is a great
and incessant demand for women in the
matrimonial market of these provinces. In
other words, it is taken for granted that the
two sexes should be in equal proportion, and
as they are notin equal proportion, therefore
Australia wants women—any kind of them
and any quantity. The theory would hold
good if every man desired to find a partner,
but as it happens he does not. And, on the
other hand, almost every woman does. The
number of men who deliberately prefer to
lead a celibate existence is enormous ; the
number of Avomen avlio so desire can be
counted on the Angers. This circumstance
does not infer that Avomen are fonder
of the married state than men ; it merely
proves .that their necessities are greater.
Civilisation has made this Avorld an ex-
ceedingly cold and inhospitable place
for the spinster avlio possesses no pro-
perty and no male relatives on Avhom
she can levy for her support. In spite of
all that she has gained in recent years the
prospects of the poor and unfriended Avoman
are Avoefully blank—in Australia as Avell as
elseAvhere. Even in those occupations Avhere
she can take her place Avith men, doing the
same Avork and doing it equally well, her
Avages are little more than half those of her
male competitor. The female compositor is
a “blackleg” of necessity ; the union of the
male type-setters refuses to recognise her
existence, and her only chance of employ-
ment is in the office of some unmanly skin-
flint tradesman who Avill engage her because
she is cheap and dare not go on strike. The
tailoress is paid only a fraction of the
tailor’s wages. The Avhole class of sewing
Avomen are worked to the last extremity
that human endurance Avill permit, and
receive about as much in a week as a skilled
male Avorker does in a day. The governess
Avho educates six rampant infants and helps
in the house as Avell receives, probably, some
£35 per annum. That other overdriven
Avretch, the “lady’s companion,” inserts her
plaint daily in the morning papers, to the
effect that she “ will give her services in ex-
change for a comfortable home,” and as
clothes are not mentioned in the compact it
is to be presumed that she wears her old
stock of haggard attire so long as the least
shred of respectability remains attached to it,
and is then “ sacked ” for the sufficient reason
that she is no longer presentable enough for
the situation. And here and there a massive
person makes what is considered a lavish
income by Avashing; in other Avords, she
toils about as hard as a pick-and-shovel
artist, and realises, on an average, 255. per
week as a consequence.
• # •
Domestic service is absolutely the only
female occupation which is not overstocked.
It means practically that the servant shall bo
at the beck and call of a mistress at all hours
of the day and most of the night ; still it is
a comparatively certain resource, and the
payment is better than in most other occu-
pations. But it is unpopular for one suffi-
cient reason : nine-tenths of male humanity
has agreed for many years to look doAvn on
the domestic as an inferior animal—and con-
sequently there is a false sense of utter
degradation attached to the Avork which
nothing can remove. Moreover, half the
friendless women who strive to hang on to
the skirts of the great industrial army have
never learned the Avork of the domestic, and
therefore there remains in every Australian
city—as in every other city the Avhole Avorld
over—a great, floating mass of AvidoAvs and
spinsters, whose means of livelihood is a
mystery. Some among them become barmaids,
and of these a few wear out early in the glare
of the gas and the evil odour of stale cigars and
ancient beer-slops, and are turned adrift
when they have lost their comeliness ; and
a few more elope with some flash bar-loafer
and live more or less happily ever after-
wards ; and a very small section—the wise
virgins of the trade—lie low till the landlady
dies, and then marry the landlord, and when
he ends his career through apoplexy, they
inherit the business and give up marriage.
Some more, less fortunate, advertise in the
Evening News for some “kind, elderly
gent ” who will lend £5 to a lady in great
distress. Here and there one gets some
precarious clerical work, but these are
exceedingly few ; an advertisement offering
255. a week, without board, for any descrip-
tion of copying or semi-literary employment
will, within 48 hours, bring from 300 to 500
answers in Melbourne or Sydney, all from
women who write and speak like ladies, and
wear darned gloves, and carry shabby
umbrellas, and who are distinguished by
that anxious, weary look which comes of
much seeking after situations and finding
them not.
• • •
And they are all, to the last woman, or at
least to the last woman but one, willing to
get married. Marriage is a lottery, but,
uncertain as it is, it is still much more reli-
able than that other lottery which is repre-
sented by the list of vacant situations in the
S.M. Herald or Age. Even the “agony
column” of the daily paper bears witness
to this; the man who advertises for a
wife will receive six times as many genuine
responses as the woman who advertises for a
husband. Women are already a drug in the
market in Australia, despite the fact that
they are in a minority. Under present social
conditions, when any country contains two
women to every three men, it has as many
as can be sufficiently provided for. When
the proportion grows larger then there begins
a process of natural—or unnatural—selection
whereby the gaunt and ugly woman always
gets left. There is no place on earth in this
nineteenth century for the ugly woman.
Even in Australia, where the female sex is
probably more scarce than in any other part
of the globe, there is no man so hairy and
shapeless, so much bowed in the legs and
gone in the spine, so objectionable in man-
ners, language, or appearance, that he cannot
get a wife, while the chances of a seriously
plain woman getting a husband are exceed-
ingly limited. Even a distorted executioner
can always find a bride in this land of pros-
perity ; in England, which is many shades
worse, a gorilla, provided the animal has
any visible means of support, can choose
from among a dozen or more, probably a
hundred, of the opposite sex, all willing to
take any risk in order to get away from the
grinding poverty of modern industrialism.
* # #
There is no room in Australia for the
superfluous women of England. There is
no room for them anywhere, unless the
world’s goods are differently distributed so
as to give to each human being a reasonable
chance of sustenance. Even if all men were
able and willing to marry it would only make
the problem worse by causing an abnormal in-
crease of population in a world which, under
existing social conditions, is already over-
populated. For though the earth can furnish
necessaries and even luxuries for twice its
present population, the one incontrovertible
fact remains that it does not do so, and w ith
every increase in the census returns the
aggregate misery grows worse and still worse.
Either a remedy must be found by a com-
plete reorganisation of society, so that Dives
and Lazarus will both be abolished—or else
some day the law must begin to weed out
the superfluous population by some process
of judicial murder, and must kindly brain
the outcasts, male and female alike, for
whom it refuses to supply food and shelter.
In that case England must settle her own
butcher’s bill, in common with the rest of
the ivorld. The old policy of “ move on ”
the mean device whereby she exports her
insoluble problems and then curses other
nations because they can find no solution for
them—has done good service for three cen-
turies, but it will not answer its purpose
much longer.
Marriage and Divorce.
Dear Bulletin, What is Marriage ? Is
it a simple contract entered into by a
man and a woman for mutual convenience
and happiness, or is it a Goo-given something
lying altogether outside the region of prac-
tical life ? Are the Roman Catholics right
in their refusal to sanction any and every
description of annulment of the conjugal tie ?
Is it better for people unhappily wedded to live
in adultery, to practise promiscuity, or by
means of legal divorce to re-wed under happier
auspices? The theological objector bases an
argument on a text: “ What God hath joined
together let no man put asunder.” We might
point out in passing that the injunction is in
itself equivocal ; levelled rather at the stealer
of another’s wife. The Divorce Court Judge is
powerless to separate man and wife; they
themselves alone are able to do that. The law
simply ratifies and registers the separation.
• • •
Disease is evolutionary. Every society has
the amount of crime that it deserves. No
plague can flourish unless conditions are favour-
able to its growth. Influenza is the scourge of
thc./f n-de-sitch. Nobody knows much about it.
When it has disappeared and social conditions
have altered for the accommodation of another
disease more in consonance with them, influqnza
will be ticketed and classified, and everybody
will know everything—or nothing—about it
Marriage is very similar. It is vot regul fttef j
by society ; it regulates society. It is an insti.
tution of slow and painful growth. Man p
naturally polygamous. In primeval days l le
chose his mate for a season, and the conju<r a i
tie was of the slenderest. As lie congregated in
societies with his kind, he began to acquj le
property. Still polygamous, he exercised th e
rights of absolute proprietorship over his wives
and the tally of his wealth was the size 0 {
his harem. Little by little in the more
advanced societies monogamy was evolved, but
it had to fight hard to retain its place, and'man
took many revenges on his partner for the sur-
render of his right to marry as many wives as
he chose. Religion aided the fixing of outward
form, and the marriage-rites and the matri-
monial ideals of races were fossilised in the
codes of reformers like Mahomet. Rut the
evolution of marriage and of the social position
of woman has been going on notwithstand-
ing. V\ e have long ceased to regard
woman as mere property ; with the grow'th of
Socialism we are beginning to outgrow' our con-
ception of woman as a medium for the pre-
servation of property. With the last expiring
notion of the right of private ownership of
land and the sanctity of landlordism, the idea
of the sanctity of the legal marriage will also
disappear. The conception of such a thing as
the “sanctity” of marriage is only a rider on
the conception of such“ a thing as the
“reproach” of bastardy. With the destruc-
tion of the landlord, illegitimacy will become a
dream, and the Divorce Court will extend its
ladder of successive flights of steps from the
rigidity of the priest-knotted union to the
elysium of free conjugal contract.
* # #
All divorce extension enactments tend to the
abolition of marriage. It is, in fact, the Anglo-
Saxon method of correcting the mistakes of the
original contract. Woman clamours for the
franchise, but the franchise will fail to make
her politically the equal of man unless she is
socially and sexually his equal, and this
equality she is learning to seek through an
extension of the scope of the divorce laws.
Political equality of the sexes is impossible
while one sex is conjugally subject to the
other ; and blink the matter as we may, the
solution of the struggle for equality will be
found in the total abolition of state-recognised
marriage. It is purely a question of the
development of Socialism. The marriage ideal
which has grown out of actual buying and sell-
ing rights over a wdfe cannot stand before the
tests applied by the New Order. Woman moves
slowly along the socialistic plane. Her first
great triumph was the popular recognition of
the principle of monogamy. To-day she is
demanding the franchise. To-morrow she will
demand release from all marital control and
absolute liberty of conjugal contract. We cannot
say that this is ethically right; nor can we say
that it is wrong. It is, however, the trend of
modern sociology. A little while since Mrs.
J ulian Ashton read a paper before the Sydney
branch of the Women’s Suffrage League in
which she railed on modern marriage in good
set terms, and raised thereby the active opposi-
tion of the entire shortsighted sisterhood, wdio,
although clamouring for voting equality with
man, do not recognise that such equality implies
absolute social and sexual responsibility for
woman. Mrs. Ashton simply put in a plea for
freedom of the matrimonial contract, and in
doing this she was unconsciously urged onward
by the spirit of her time. People cannot
absorb Ibsen and Tolstoi, Mona Cairo and
Paul BouroEt without being alternately dis-
gusted with the modern marriage and childishly
enthusiastic for future freedom. Separation,
like Federation, is in the air, and nothing can
be done for woman until nothing is done for
her—she must settle the problem of her own
position, incited thereto by the prophets of the
New Order.
# * #
What, however, is marriage? The union of
a man and a woman in perfect sexual fidelity
for a period—for life say the Roman Catholics.
In this, then, exists the “sanctity” of mar-
riage, in the perfect sexual fidelity ? The mere
ceremony is not marriage, the clerically-blessed
vows, the mystical mummery ; the only thing
worthy the name is the preservation of a
plighted troth in its integrity. Granted ; but
are not many men, united by the ceremonial of
the Church, false to their vows of conjugal
constancy ? Are not many who have never
taken such vows true to the one love unblessed
by priest or parson ? Which is the marriage
here ? If the Church refuses to dissolve the
loveless union, will men and women not live
openly in the free union without the sanction of
the Church ? The question of immorality
involved is a question for ecclesiasticism to
answer. When the Church refuses or is unable
to toe the chalk-line of progress her influence
immediately begins to ebb. The other day the
Pope had an opportunity of which he failed to
make the most. He might have headed, and
stemmed also, the socialistic movement —he
condemned it. He denounced the present con-
dition of things, but he refused to sanction any
other. When the cheering has subsided wdiich
hails the supreme Pontiff’s “sympathy with
Labour,” it will be found that the influence of
Rome has lapsed two centuries. Ere the Pope
spoke, everything was possible. He has spoken,
and his word stands infallibly committed. In
another decade men will critically compare the
utterances of the successor of St. Peter with
the dreams of ages, and the multitude of voices
of even the present century. As in the social
movement so in marriage. The sandal worn by
the saint of the keys is too small for the foot of
this latter day. Protestantism has protested
once, hence its influence is dead for ever. Its
benison or its malison helps or hurts not a whit.
The voice of the Nonconformist clergyman, or
of the bishop of the Established Church, is no
holier than the voice of Bradlaucjh or of
Huxley. With Catholicism it is different.
The antiquity of the Church is alone a saving
power. The splendid roll of its achievements,
its gloriously human side, its active philan-
throphy, its .esthetic sensuousness, its literature,
its arts, and its traditions—all these are claims
on the cars of men to be heard, and heard
loudly when aught is uttered that touches
keenly the business and interests of the people.


, ,| ]e jd c a of hierarchy is opposed to the idea
T’ u c j a iism. Socialism favours equality —caste
0 S °biy and sex equality. The Church sees in
°T u ‘ l 01 jjy a point in space put in its relative
n ' al '\ion to other points in space by the hand of
P oSI living God. The Church sees in woman
t“ e {j ie wanton who tempted St. Anthony
eltft g - n or the mystic bride of Heaven. The
10 , holds the intermediate position, and as she
ffl6 stepped down from the ideal heights of
* iaS t jy purity to wed mere flesh and blood, she
sal “ ,ished somewhat by being compelled to
lS i L-ve unreasoning fidelity to the man who has
0 3 g(X | i, er lapse from mystic purity. A Roman
iMholic may, for certain reasons, obtain a
r orce from the State ; his Church will, how-
‘l u ever release him. He may, if he choose,
1 iu what is denounced by that Church as
'il iltery he married, his sin would be called
r 'amv- The two factors in modern progress
b 'e\voman and labour—the Church has refused
f r ef;u’d cither in the light that they demand.
This Is a pity— for the R.C. Church.
* * *
The modern marriage is doomed ! Its death
y ] 3e a slow one, but every wound hastening
it will he received through a legislative enact-
ment enlarging the operation of the divorce laws.
The “ saptity ” of marriage will be, is being,
utterly ground to powder by the iconoclasm of
divorce,'ami in this work of destruction female
suffrage will play no insignificant part. It may
bo the best or the worst thing that ever hap-
pened to woman, but it will happen. It is
ridiculous to hold women themselves as respon-
sible for this new trend of modern thought.
They arc obedient only to a blind force which
is leading them they know not whither. The
woman movement is part and parcel of the trades-
union movement and the social movement. The
at ack on landlordism, the advocacy of land-
ir.lionalisation, the demand for confiscatory
probate duties, the arraignment of the law of
inheritance, are successive blows dealt at the
nyves of matrimony. The union of the future
will and must be a union of sentiment, just as
the union of the present is of necessity a union
of interest; but iu order that sentiment may
realise its own demands it will tolerate no
restriction and recognise no authority but its
own. There may be a lot of danger in all this
for Humanity, but Humanity has weathered
worse perils. One thing is, however, un-
doubtedly a danger of an extreme character,
f aught with very serious consequences, and
1 1 is is the unphilosophical attempts put forward
by sentimental idealists to curb, crib, coffin and
coniine a purely natural and necessary develop-
ment. They may do so for a season, but it only
adds to the difficulties of ultimate adjustment.
They appeal to the “sanctity” of marriage;
hut the word “sanctity” is only a word, and
in the present connection it died in the mediaeval
aje-. -B.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Cheap Labourer on Strike.
Tub Italian immigration scheme in Queensland
is already showing signs of collapse, and in its
collapse another woo is added to the troubles of
the province. The Roman organ-grinder is on
strike, and the country has only the satisfaction
of knowing that it has imported, at the expenseof
the overburdened taxpayer, several hundred un-
employed in addition to the great army already
inexistence. As the event proves, this cheap alien
is much loss fitted than the Australian to work
in the malarious atmosphere of the tropical
cmic-tields. The one and only reason for his
existence in Queensland is his alleged capacity
for toiling 12 hours per diem for an infinitesimal
pittance per week and a microscopic ration,
and now that this alleged capacity is utterly
disproved, there is no reason for him at all.
All over Central Queensland gangs of destitute
and desperate Italians are tramping south-
ward, ready to work at half wages and thus
tut down the pay of the distressed Austra-
lian still lower ready to beg, borrow or
steal, or to, do anything, in fact, save go back
to labour at less than Chinese rates on the
Northern plantations. Most of them will pre-
Sently vanish among the slums of Brisbane
and Sydney, and help to swell the chronic
demand for relief works or public charity, and
their places will bo taken by fresh swarms of
Italians who will be sifted through the planter’s
sieve in like manner, and then go out to be a
airdcu on the community at large. The country
pays the. freight upon these strangers, the planter
yets probably one month’s work out of them, and
'en the nation has to support them for ever
a ? r . WWa ds > and if all Italy were imported by
instalments into Northern Queensland, the
Plantations would presently be as bare of em-

world into Australia through the medium of the
Queensland plantations.
A Melbourne Weed.
Negotiations have been pushed to the point of
holding public meetings of interested share-
holders with a view to the amalgamation of
three Melbourne daily papers — Daily Tele-
graph (morning) and the Herald and the
Evening Standard. Up to date, these efforts
have been unsuccessful. The consummation of
the proposed amalgamation is to herald a
newspaper cable monopoly and further em-
bastion the position of the anti-derao-
cratic press. The three papers thus trying
to become absorbed into one are, broadly
speaking, “ birds of a feather.” Each has been
running its own little rig against the interests
of the democracy : not one is an exponent of
the real sentiments of the people. Melbourne
Daily Telegraph has been run by a politi-
cally poisonous, and, in some other respects,
also venomous, nest of bigoted, wealthy
pietists, grim and bleak as the land from which
most of them made their descent upon Austra-
lia. The Herald, as a variant of a similar
type, has been under Irish control, and,
being Irish, it became its constant care to
save its consequent reputation by roaring
out its effusive loyalty upon the slightest pro-
vocation or excuse ; and it has succeeded in
exhibiting itself upon a thousand occasions as a
very ground-worm among newspapers. The
Evening Standard is a vapour of puff and
grovel, which howls “ God save the Queen ” all
the time, and is fathered by a crowd, at whose
head is that rich vanity-monger, Simon Eraser,
the individual who commissioned Millais to
paint his portrait for a sum, variously stated at
amounts ranging from £lOOO to £3OOO. Mel-
bourne has not one single daily newspaper that
does not “ go kronk” on every important demo-
cratic question. The Age, the biggest “ demo-
cratic” fraud by which a free and presumably
intelligent people ever permitted itself to be
gulled, has, on countless occasions, deliberately
betrayed the masses, and is betraying them
now ; but it is a cheering sign of the sound-
ness of the Victorian democracy’s core, that
occasional nnmistakeable evidence proves that
the glamour once exercised by the Age is a
lost and ridiculed pretension. Labour-Member
Hancock demonstrated this when he stormed
the working-man’s electorate of Collingwood in
the teeth of the publicly-blasted thunder of that
once mighty organ. If it were possible to
make a papier-mdche politician out of the Age,
Judas Iscariot could be resurrected and fully
identified. The Argus is always opposed to
the people, but it makes no virtuous pretence
that it is not run in the interests of a class.
The Argus is, in fact, the organ of “ the vicar
and the squire,” so far as those English institu-
tions can be parodied in Australia. Mel-
bourne’s present journalistic need is a straight-
out, radical, republican paper, not necessarily
competing in size and expenditure with the
amalgamated triplet, when that ■wonderful
combination does take place, but with an
integrity above bribery, and always run by men
whose pens shall drip the gall and wormwood
that is really in the writers’ hearts. There is
a gigantic opening in Melbourne for two or
three sincere radicals, intellectually original
enough to aerate the furnaces of democracy,
and fearless enough to perform to its omega the
journalistic duties they would, in such instance,
take upon their own shoulders. There is a
magnificent democratic battle to be fought in
the South, and, even though the present daily
Press of that province’s metropolis is arrayed
against the people’s cause all up the gamut of
manhood’s aspirations, the great bulk of the
Victorian population is quite sound on demo-
cratic questions. It needs but a magnetic
popular leader to strike the key-notes. Vic-
torian politicians are now overborne by the big
newspapers. It Premier Shiels is a Radical,
he dare not attempt to give effect to his views.
Did another Berry arise and awaken the
slumbering volcanoes in the united mind of the
Victorian masses, he would, despite the plural
vote, sweep the polls victoriously from Wilson’s
Promontory to Mildura, and from Casterton to
Croajingolong. At present, the inner demo-
cracy of Victoria has no exponential expression.
The Logic of Monopoly.
The following is published in Sydney Echo. It
is merely a letter from a correspondent in the
West, but the Echo cheerfully inserts it under
the heading “Scandalous Outrages in Queens-
land,” and, by so doing, distinctly endorses the
statements and accepts them as its own :
“The firestick brigade has been at work at Cameron
Downs. Six men well known to the police, travelling
from Hughenden towards Muttaburra, lighted the grass
on the road in many places. A police patrol saw the men
on the road, and later saw the fires, but could not convict
the inoendiarists. Kain fell soon after, and no serious
damage was done. 1 only report the matter to you, says
Mr. Crombib, “in order that you may be in a position to
advise the authorities of the scoundrelism which is wan-
dering about and waiting any opportunity which may
offer to reduce Central Queensland to an ash-heap. Our
manager offered £lOO reward for evidence that would
secure a conviction, but so far without result. It is sup-
posed these are the revenge committee, or a portion of
them, who some time ago issued a threatening manifesto
from Hughenden. They are travelling this way, and
would probably have given us all a turn if the rain had
not spoilt their game.”
The generous and honourable monopolist shines
forth conspicuously in this effusion. Every
summer bush lires break out and rage furiously
in almost all parts of Australia, and particularly
in the North, where the sun is hottest and the
grass is driest. They were prevalent before
the white man first invaded the country, and
the earliest explorers passed through forests of
blackened stumps, and traversed great wastes
of ashes and desolation. When the country is
at peace, these conflagrations are set down to
chance or accident, or any other impersonal
influence ; when there is dissension between
Capital and Labour, they are ascribed in
every case to the brutal, bloodthirsty and
revolutionary shearer. This year there have
been much fewer fires than usual, Imt at every
separate blaze the monopolist howls for
vengeance on the labourer, and despatches
frantic telegrams about an imaginary “ lirestick
brigade ” —which is almost as logical as if he
demanded that the shearer should be sent to
gaol for drought, or scab, or pleuro-pneumonia.
In the present instance it appears that six men
were travelling along a road and there was a
fire. There is generally someone travelling
along a road, and there is just as much visible
or necessary connection between the two events
as if “ Mister James ” Fairfax had walked
down Pitt-street, Sydney, and a Chinaman had
had a fit. If the fact of the aforesaid men
being on the Muttaburra road proves that they
created the fires, then the fact of Mr. Fairfax
being in Pitt-street proves that he caused the
Mongol to have the fit. Nobody possesses any
vestige of evidence to show that the aforesaid
individuals caused the conflagration, or that it
arose from any other influences than those
which led to previous conflagrations when the
land was still an empty wilderness; but all
the same the Echo cheerfully describes them as
“ incendiarists ” and “ the revenge committee.”
Yet what a storm there would be in the office
of that moral paper if some other journal
published an equally logical and Christian
paragraph like this :
The fire-fiend is at work. The proprietor of the Echo, a
person well known to the police, was seen travelling down
Sussex-street, and immediately afterwards a fire was dis-
covered in the back premises of Mrs. Jane Smith. Unfor-
tunately, there is no evidence to convict the loathsome
incendiary who evidently wants to reduce this city to an
ash-heap. A reward of £lOO has been offered for his con-
viction, but as yet without avail.
The two cases are absolutely identical, even to
the fact of both parties being “ well known to
the police.” The proprietor of the Echo is
well known to these functionaries inasmuch as
they almost all recognise him when he passes
by. The six base miscreants on the Mutta-
burra road were also “well-known”—in fact,
the “cop” who is stationed for any length of
time in a lonely Queensland township knows
everybody, including the local preaching man
and the infuriated squatter-person whose grass
took fire. Therefore, the fact proves no more
than the circumstance of the Chief Justice
being known to the Governor demonstrates
that the former is the cause of the Windsor
murder. The contention of the Echo simply
amounts to this : When any disaster happens
to a rich man, any poor man who happens to
be within 10 or 20 miles of the trouble can be
lawfully inserted in a grovelling newspaper
under the designation of “Scandalous Outrage.”
Of such materials is the logic of Monopoly con-
structed.

The New South Wales Cheap Labour
Bureau.
That noble institution, the Government Labour
Bureau, of Sydney, pursues the even tenor of
its way, and quietly and unobtrusively—after
the manner of all truly benevolent organisations
—it has already done much to diminish the
chronic suffering of the New South Wales
capitalist. There is a great falling-off in the
number of unemployed ; the seedy men with
the haggard eyes, who are always looking for
work, have been sent up country, and things
begin to assume a more promising aspect.
Whenever a back-blocks employer has a diffi-
culty with his men because they object to work
longer hours with a corresponding reduction of
wages, he at once telegraphs to the Labour
Bureau, and the Government despatches a sutli-
cient number of labourers on the free-pass
system to undersell those who have been locked
out, and thus the number of unemployed in the
city is daily diminishing. Some of these men
have declined to go blacklegging at the expense
of others, and are now walking back, hungry
and laden with curses ; others accepted the
work, and in these cases it is the men whom
they supplanted who are walking back instead.
But till they arrive things look better in the
city of Sydney. The demand for labour, since
the Bureau commenced operations, has been
enormous. Nearly every employer in the far
West and South and North started to
reduce wages w'henever he heard of that
noble institution, and when his employes
objected, he sent in a requisition for men—who
were promptly sent up at the country’s expense
—to take their places. Most of these were
unionists, but even the most ardent unionist is
very likely to go back on his principles when
a paternal Government has dropped him down
in a howling wilderness 600 miles from his
home, and he must either turn renegade or
walk back, with no earthly prospects at the
end of his journey. It is a simple and effective
inode of conversion; if Pabkes or G. H. Reid
were deposited in a penniless state at (say)
Wilcannia, with the option of turning Protec-
tionists or getting home on foot without any
reasonable hope of victuals en route, they would
turn Protectionists then and there, both of them.
There is no demand for labour at decent wages
in the country districts any more than in the
city ; every man who is sent out only deprives
another man of work, and when the Bureau
finds billets for 400 unemployed, and proudly
mentions the fact in its report, it has simply
made 400 more unemployed—who are not men-
tioned in the report —in their stead. Then the
400 who have lost their work through the
agency of the nefarious institution will gravi-
tate by degrees, and at much cost of shoe-
leather, back to the city; and when their old
employers make a further reduction of wages,
and their successors go on strike, they will be
shipped back at the country’s cost to the billets
which they held before, and the Government
will announce that another great squadron of
poor and deserving men have been provided for,
and 400 more labourers will commence the
eternal process of walking back. The only man
for whom the Bureau has found a genuine
billet, and who isn’t walking back, is the
manager, Mr. Joseph Greer, whose salary
goes on regularly, whatever happens. The
institution has found work for one unemployed ,
anyhow. $
Even the Mackay Standard, a special cham-
pion of sugar-planters, holds that Premier
Griffith lias no constitutional right to reverse
the deliberately expressed policy of the electors
in respect of black labour, without first rc-sub-
mitting the question to those electors. It
maintains that newsnaner contributions and
press leaders form no warrant for Griffith’s
proposed course of action, and says that “there
is obviously a constitutional method of pro-
cedure which even (!) Sir S. W. Griffith dare
not depart from without laying himself open to
the condemnation of those lovers of law and
order of whom he now declares, himself the
champion.” This is healthy talk, although the
Mackay Standard advocates an immediate
election as likely to result in a popular endorse-
ment of Griffith’s MTlwraithian policy.
Brisbane Telegraph has definitively pro-
nounced against the resuscitation of black
labour, and prefers rather to see the
total extinction of the sugar industry
than the revival of the colour ferment.
As Brisbane Telegraph always tries to jump
with the cat of public opinion, this also is a
cheering sign. The Toowoomba Chronicle,
the newspaper owned by William Henry
Groom, whom Griffith, after a hot fight,
landed in the Speaker’s chair in ’B3, also opposes
the black-labour proposals, tooth and nail.
Labour member Glassey is probably right in
his prophecy that there are enough anti-black
members in the Bananaland Assembly to compel
Griffith, whether he likes it not, to appeal to
the country on both his nigger proposals and
his (or rather MTlwraith’s) “trans-continen-
tal ” land-grant railway scheme. W. 0. Hodg-
kinson, Minister for Mines, and Griffith’s
champion apologist, has more than hinted that
his own idea of a compromise is to indent
coloured labour from British New Guinea,
♦
The old Queensland “ labour-trade ” among the
islands was one constant record of kidnapping
and murder at sea, and of black men dying like
rotten sheep on the plantations. Interspersed
with these events there were a few instances
when the slave-hunters quarrelled amongst
themselves, and then the older and more astute
ruffians of the blackbirding service generally
“informed” upon some green and harmless
victim who had rashly entered his protest
against their methods, and got him penal servi-
tude for life, the first five years in irons. The
islanders who died were happier than those who
returned, for nobody kept any very accurate
record of where they came from, and the kindly
captain and his pal, the drunken Government
agent, often simply dropped them among any
hostile tribe that was handy, and sailed away.
Now that these old horrors are about to start
afresh Bishop Selwyn, of Melanesia, suggests
(it is cabled) that the Government itself sliould
conduct the service, in order to prevent the
“ recuiting ” of children without the consent of
their parents, and other abominations. It
would be interesting to know how the Govern-
ment could conduct such a service, so as to
make it respectable. It must pay by results or •
it won’t get any niggers, and if it pays by
results wholesale kidnapping becomes a dead
certainty. • (
As to murderer Bertrand’s proposed release
after being 26 years in a New South Wales gaol
(from his 24th to his 50th year), the case stands
thus : No other sane murderer has ever been
locally imprisoned so long. Bertrand is
believed to be still in gaol only because of
certain entries concerning a lady (related to a
prominent powerful official) found in his diary.
This theory may or may not be untrue, but the
fact remains that the convict has been treated
in a most markedly exceptional way. The
Bulletin regards capital punishment as a
hoary and useless fraud upon civilisation, and
holds that every fairly-convicted cold-blooded
murderer should be imprisoned for life. But
fish should not be made of one and flesh of
another. Many dangerous ruffians reprieved
from the gallows long after Bertrand’s con-
viction have been at large for years.

Why is it that judges, alone among all the ser-
vants of the State, should be so exceedingly
subject to lachrymose emotion ? At frequent
intervals we read that some occupant of the
bench passed sentence in a broken utterance, or
granted a decree nisi with tears in his eyes.
The latest instance of this weakness is the case
of Judge Windeyer, who made an order in the
Bradley matrimonial case “ with a trembling
break in his voice and a visage expressive of
strong feeling.” The matter was principally a
plain circumstance concerning alimony, and
there is nothing specially tearful about alimony
to account for the outbreak. Judges seem to
have a monopoly of this sort of thing ; their
work is not much more affecting than that of
other public functionaries, but they don’t seem
to bear up like the rest of the service. We
never read of how Mr. See was moved while
bringing in his financial statement, or
that John Hogg, road-mender, commenced
with deep emotion to repair the highway in the
vicinity of Goff’s Harbour. The present writer
went gold-hunting in the days of his stormy
youth, but no official burst into tears while
taking the money for his miner’s right. Nobody
ever saw a policeman weeping as he hauled a
burglar to the lockup, though he, equally with
the Judge, is a representative of the law, and
a Government Astronomer seldom breaks down
while looking for a new comet, nor does the
hangman ever weep while tying his clients’ arms
at the elbows. The Judge runs this branch of
business all by himself. "He reminds us of the
gentle, maudlin novel of the early part of this
century, in which the small, pale, gentle
heroine wept bitterly at least once on each
page. The public grew tired of that heroine in
course of time hy reason of her weeping, and
they will get tired of the sentimental occupant
of the bench for the same reason. This country
wants dry Judges.
They say now Rev. Fitchett is actually
returning to London, to help in editing the Re-
view of Reviews. Well, he’s clever enough for
anything, this quarryman turned parson. Ho
struck oil with his ‘“X Y Z” papers, in the
Melbourne Spectator, but the odium theologicum,
professional jealousy, actually got them stopped,
or rather the very heavy lead of the Rev. Dough-
nut Buncombe was substituted for Fitchett’s keen
rapier. Fitchett used to write fiercely in the
Southern Cross, against people going to church
in carriages, but on returning from England, the
first time, he drove a natty buggy, with a pony
pair, to his Sunday preaching appointments.
Only a change of opinion—like Sam Griffith on

816 Macquarie-slreet North, Sydney, March 9,1892.
M v Dear Moorabinda,—
A great rush of decollette to the dress circle was observ-
able at the one-night revival of “ Lucia di Lammeimoor”
at the Royal last Saturday, and every seat in the house
was taken. Mayoress Manning had a party in the prompt
d.c. box, and wore a black gown with jet about it (by the
way, black gowns with jet about them were worn by
every second woman, and they made the d.c. look as if
it wanted blotting); Miss Manning, in black, trimmed
with coppery pink. Mrs. Simpson, in a black gown with
crimson feather fan, had her daughter with her, wearing
red veiling and brocade. Mrs. Bland Holt, fresh from
hygienic Tasmania, sported a brown lace and silk gown,
trimmed with bronze beads, diamond ornaments ; and a
musical lady from Manly was funeralish in silver tinsel
cloth and black lace. Apropos, though the whole house
rose and shrieked rapturously at Cuttica, only one little
flora,! offering fluttered over the footlights. Theatrical
applause is sometimes like spurious friendship—it can’t
be distinguished from the, genuine thing until you ask it
to put its hand in its pocket.
The wardrobe behind the curtain was mostly Scotch, ye
ken. In the first scene tha lark-like Cuttica (itinerant
habitues of Covent Garden unearthed in local dress circles
bracket her with Patti) was a sonsie lassie enough in a
cream and cardinal checked short skirtlet with black
velvet bodice and Glengarry cap and tartan socks, com-
plete in which Hielan’ get-up she looked like the younger
sister of the “ Lucia ” w ho sallied forth in the next act in
a. white satin trained skirt with girdle studded with stage
diamonds ; but I hope no advanced virgin will look upon
this as a rejuvenation tip, and come simpering out
with half a tuck between her bony knees and an un-
charitable world, in consequence. In the vocally difficult
mad scene, a white chiffon robe-de-chambre tied with
white satin ribbons was sported with much effect, but
how Lucia could act as she did against a depressing back-
ground of apparently petrified supes is an enigma—why
can’t the choristers see that it isn’t natural to stand
simpering with your hands folded in “stage direction”
manner while a lunatic dances in an alcove with a
dagger? And, speaking of the human padding, it looked
odd to see the huntsmen in the first scene all retainers of
Enrico, and, therefore, all liable to the same complaint in
plaid, each in a kilt of different tartan, one daring spirit
draped in Rob Roy ! Also “Arturo,” a little “ slipped ”
in the knee and got up in pink and lavender satin with
lace round his perky knickerbockers, was the most awful
warning one could desire to frighten the foppish youths
who want to introduce a few rainbows into their conven-
tional black and white dress-suit.
Apropos of masculine fal-de-rals, why is it that an
Italian or a Frenchman can wear a sgventeenth-century
suit and look as happy and natural as if he put it on every
morning when he got up, while an Englishman, trimmed
with tinsel and lace, looks as if he had just dropped in to
apply lor the job hearing that the other scarecrow had
got the sack? The same with vocalisation. The average
“farriner”, warbles as if the erotic melodies had that
moment just occurred to him, hut the average Englishman
throws sentiment off his chest parrotishly, as if he were
dying to explain between verses, “ Put all the tom-foolery
down to the composer— l’ve had no hand in it.”
‘ ‘ Un Balio in Maschera ” ran a brief two nights at Sydney
Royal, with Guidotti (her stage method of locomotion
looks as if she was hiccoughing with both feet) as the fair
co-respondent; her wardrobe seemed down to low water-
mark, judging by the fact that she sported one long-tailed
black veivet-and-moire garment for three solid acts. And
the worst of it was that the garment was the same sar-
torial shriek in which she saw “ Elvira” and “ Leonora ”
through. Of course, in grand opera trills, and not
toilettes, are the things you go for, but it’s cuttingit too
fine to put up three tragic females in one frock, for all
the world as if they were members of one operatic tribe
with an hereditary rag handed down like the family
diamonds. In the fifth act, Amelia was dressed in puce
satin, the front criss-crossed with gold cord, but the lady
was so smothered in what looked like a lace robe-de-nuit
and nightcap en suite that the full dazzle of her array
didn’t get into the limelight. Dolly-wigged Mattioli was
a well-dressed Oscar—her last suit of blue-and-gold look-
ing like a Masonic emblem and a bon-bon.
On dit that a recently-deceased personage (has left his
daughters a thousand each as a remembrancer—but on
the principle of the more you have the more you grab at
there is some grumbling, of course. By the way, his
youngest daughter flew in the face of a big settlement
over 10 years ago by marrying someone on whose account
pa threatened to cut her off with a blessing. The paternal
consent to the union was given very trickily. The suitor
had harassed him for some time (his religious convictions
wouldn’t let him marry against the wisli of a rich parent,
you bet), and at last pa gave in. But after the marriage-
cereraony the dear old parent blandly told the palpitating
pair—“ I gave you my consent because I knew my
daughter’s -er—obstinacy—hut the marriage is against
my will, and you won’t get a penny when I’m dead.” Bub
they did, for she shares equally with the rest.
Which reminds me that the same old gentleman always
kept a keen eye on his domestic expenditure until he was
100 donc-up to add two and two. Iq his vigorous days he had
a decided “down” on file laundress and invariably
suspected that misconstrued female of appropriating his
linen. To make her shake in her guilty shoes he, always
counted his washing under her very nose, carefully com-
paring the returns with a list of .the output which he
religiously kept. That is the sort of man who will always
run into six figures.
How do you account for the fixed manner in which
the Australian society girl now travels all the way to
London to he married—dragging the happy man with
her, though, of course, he always goes by another tub?
In Sydney at least the top layer girl seems to have a
craven fear of giving up the single ghost in a local church,
and one vaguely wonders why these roving marriages are
so popular. One young lady who fled to England to
shake off the virginal coil had good reason, for there was
an old lover looming in the background swearing that he
would put in his claim—“ aye, at the very altar-rails ”
and she got away to England just to checkmate the
vindictive person ; but surely that motive doesn’t actuate
all these wandering couples? Is it natural for a girl to
flee away from kith and kin and the admiring women
who would hop a mile and a quarter to get a good
seat at the ceremony—not to mention the two-column
newspaper comments on the proceedings in general from
the breakfast to the colour of the bride’s stockings—just
to be married in a cold English church with no gueslsi
and the dejeuner set out in some gilded pub.? It can’t be
that all society brides have a gloomy past that threatens
to make a scene in front of the parson, and it can’t be
that the blushing leading lady prefers to undergo the
matrimonial metamorphosis among strangers. In the
interests of caterers, frockists and the local clergy there
ought to be a clause in the ITotectionist policy enforcing
a heavy duty on all such matrimonial exports ; don’t you
think ?
Hearing all about “fashionable” Australian weddings,
one cannot help remarking how the old barriers against
moneyed trade are being pulled down in this age of
cynicism and creature-comfort, when fathers who, not
so longer ago, would sooner have given their gal to a
sweep than a shopman, gladly hand her over to young
Mr. Tailor’s Goose, yea—and boast of him afterwards !
Time was when the particular haughty parent that I
have in my mind’s eye, Horatio, turned up the nose that
had been in his family for aeons at a much more
distangay alliance than the one to which he now gives
his smiling sanction. The moral to all this seems to be
that it’s best to marry Matilda to the first respectable
bidder, because you never know how long her complexion
will last. Your daughter may be peach-cheekcd and
eleven-stone this year; next year she may be a gal of
nine-stone-four, with an apricot-coloured skin, who looks
particularly old when she laughs. It must be a dreadful
thing to have a woman like that about a house. “Small
profits and quick returns’’—that is the latter-day
matrimonial motto.
“ How does Lady Jersey treat you ?” loftily enquired a
lady (of the female deputation variety) of a comrade, who
in reply sadly and enviously confessed that she and
M.E.J. weren’t chummy, at which her antagonist
smiled in an inner-circle manner before proceeding to
enlarge upon her intimate relations with our Figurehead.
And the little scene set me thinking of the myriads of
women there are whose sole ambition is to buttonhole
Lady J. on some pretext or another and then talk about
it for the rest of their natural lives. Women who rat-tat
at Government House to beg patronage for a flannel
petticoat contest, carry on afterwards as if they and Lady-
Jersey were boon comrades, while next-door listens mouth
open. Then there is the pushing philanthropist who
wood-pecks at the sacred portal to draw M.E.J.’s atten-
tion to the virtues of the horns for stray sheep— and she
goes away after wasting an hour or two of the vice-regal
morning, in a paroxysm of gratitude, apparently because
that amiable personage didn’t haughtily order a flunkey
to remove the visitant with a pair of parlour-tongs.
Female book-canvassers, who manage to get an audience
on the strength of a subdued manner and widow’s weeds,
come away in ecstacies and tumble over a female deputa-
tion coming in with vague ideas of what their grievance
really is, being only clear on the point that if Her Ex. put
up with them for 20 minutes they will all solemnly nod to
her on every occasion that offers, and speak with authority
on vice-regal movements and Intentions for the rest of
their reign. I wonder if Lady J. has the remotest idea of
how many female friends she’s got ?
Talking about vice-regalities, Lady Onslow, accompanied
as far as Moss Vale by Lady Jersey, and squired for the
whole journey by Mr. Gosohen, left Sydney, (o catch the
Oroya at Adelaide* in the vice-regal state car on 3rd inst.
Lady O. is a young-looking personage, with dark hair and
eyes, and a face untouched by Art, and her travelling
dress of pale-grey tweed, with loose jacket open over a
white shirt and tie, topped off by a small white sailor hat
and veil, became her admirably. Her brace of infants
were there, too—“Huia” (a little podge of a child), stiffly
starched in white embroidery, and a little daughter in a
white sailor costume with blue collar and man-o’-war hat.
By the way, the vice-regal state-car is a cut above the
white carriage (like a frozen-milk truck) that bore Caring-
ton conspicuously to and fro. Jersey’s perambulating
shrine is in three divisions—the main idea being a
drawing-room, got up in strawberry - and - gold satin
brocade, with small tables and chairs in white cane, and
window-drapes in brocade and ruby plush. Off this
magnificence is a boudoir for ladies, upholstered (the
room, not the women) in pearl-grey satin brocade ; while
off the other end of the drawing-room, the gentlemen’s
smoking den, in brown leather, opens out. It must be a
gorgeous panorama to travel amongst, and the only pity
is that the arrangements don’t include limelight, to throw
on the very special gold-laced guard who always hangs on
the rear platform of the car as a guarantee of good faith.
“Salvation processions are now the great rage,” as
Fred. Leslie used to sing, and if they work much deeper
into the system of the “ mahses,” kerridge folk will have
to submit to coachee in flowing black trews and unpadded
weskit—judging by the recent experience of a Potts
Point lady. Her appeal for a Jehu had been answered by
a Saved Soul with a grovelling reference from his last
place, so he was joyously engaged on the spot and sent
off to the tailor’s for a brand-new livery—green and pink
■with the breeches a skin-tight fit in white doeskin. But
when the man of threads came to them, the Saved Soul
with a forbearing smile, told him “ not to trouble about
cutting of ’em out just at once like,” and beat a retreat
back to his situation and demanded to see the “ missus.”
“ The fak is, ma’am,” he said, bashfully, “ them breeches
are too tight for any man who believes in being clad
■decently, and I carn’t take the place if they goes with it„
ma’am—it’s no better nor a play-hactor !” He was dis-
missed indignantly, tor, of course, the matron couldn’t
afford to spoil the look of her box-seat with a pair of
reefed garments.
A most officially sacred Sydney lady is in despair just
now over a box of toys which she sent to some children
in England by a cruising relative just departed thence.
The toys were tiny green frogs, looking harmless enough
at sight, but when they were half way home the sender
■discovered—by a sample left behind—that each frog was
loaded with dynamite! Cables were sent to warn the
recipients of the Anarchistic nature of the toys, and now
The sacred lady afore-mentioned has horrible visions of
the whole of her small and unsuspecting relatives being-
blown sky-high and coming down in “ merry little bits”
an the next country.
It is a fact that Miss Lucy Garran, daughter of the
■veteran Dr. Garran, M.L.0., late editor of the S.M,
Herald, has taken to the boards and lately played a.
small part in the B. aud B. “ Much Ado ” production at
Melbourne Bijou under the nom de theatre of “Ruth
Willmott.” I am afraid Mr. Brough is responsible for
turning the thoughts of many damsels stagewards, for
all the Thespian recruits seem to try their luck with the-
“ young managers ” first of all. The vision of Mrs, B. in
tall evening dress surrounded by. admirers in dress-suits
uttering themostlovely sentiments, actson stage-stricken
damsels as a candle does on a moth, apparently.
Lady Jersey’s index expurgatorias will, on dit, include
the name of a pretty girl whom two society matrons
audibly insulted in a smart rag-shop recently as they
stood beside her at the counter. How women do hasten
to score off a girl (and especially a pretty one) when a
little cloud no bigger than a champagne bottle appears
in the social Cast!
Governors’ sposas are not liable, it would seem, to the
vulgar feminine emotion of jealousy. What ordinary
married woman would be pleased and satisfied if hubby
packed her off to England per P. and O. and got there
himself via Japan? Just fancy the fate of the middle-
class married man who dared to announce, “ My dear
my ship sails via China on the 4th ; yours, on the 20th
instant!!” Wouldn’t she just put her foot down on his
innocent little scheme of reviewing, en garcon, Yum
Yum et Cie on their native tca-cnest!
You can’t open a women’s paper without coming across
a streak or two of “ proposal ” recipes, showing how a
man should offer his hand and heart, and the whole tiling
generally reads like the mirage of an old maid who hasn’t
been there. But the latest screed lias more sense and
less romance than usual—the advice to the suitor lo
“leave his hat in the hall” as a leading instance, for
how could Romeo nurse his topping-off in the conventional
style and hug the girl at the same time?
Talking of proposals this seems to he Ihe latest Sydney
way :
TWILL Lady of means Lend single gentleman £SO

Which means that she can take out the interest in a revel
of blue pill and black draught besidesgiving medico (who
is careful to state he is single) a golden chance to per-
manently borrow her, too. “ Free professional services ”
is tlie most artful way of laying siege to a woman the
world lias ever seen—
A hard-up Southern journalist came home at 7 a.m. the
other day, and his wife began to make it brisk for him,
until at last, to pacify her, he said : “ Did I toll you I am
going to town to get some money to-day?" “ Judging
by the hour you came home, 1 should say you got some
yesterday,” was her telling reply. And yet they say
women cannot reason.
The riotous barn dance and the romping kitchen
Uncers are to be tabu at the best balls next season
because the more unchained festivities such as the “hoc”,
man’shop” or the “bricklayer’s ball” take to such Terpsi-
chorean riots like ducks to water, and of course society
cannot model its dance-eaid on the “program” of the
two-and-sixpenny social. Which reminds me that the
committee of the Hobart private assemblies’ very smart
hops, to which even the droit d’entree. at Government
House doesn’t make \ou eligible for an invitation, have
notices hung up in the room “requesting that no kitchen
lancers he indulged in ” for the season ’92. Last year one
or two demure ladies who found themselves involved in
such things quietly left the set and sat down by their
chaperones. At the semi-public assembly such a marked
act of disapproval is quite “in order,” but in a private
house it would be a discourtesy to one’s hostess—there-
fore the news that botli the rough-and-tumble romps are
out of court for the coming Season will be hailed with
deep and pious joy by dancing girls who don’t care to be
all the evening pinning up ripped gathers.
Yours affectionately,

There is a slaughterous article on the Pen-
tateuch in the new volume of Chambers’
Cyclopaedia.
The Melbourne unemployed flock to S.A.
This is tit-for-tat. During the Adelaide depres-
sion of ’BO Melbourne absorbed the S.A. surplus
labour.
In “Fifty Years of Colonial Life,” Mr.
Sizar Elliott, of Melbourne, relates a ghastly
experience of the unreliability of circumstantial
evidence. Away back in the Forties, when he
was in Sydney, he was a member of a jury that
tried a case of murder heard before Chief Justice
Forbes. Near Campbelltown (N.S.W.), one
evening, two men, both riding on one horse, were
returning home from work. They were heard
quarrelling as they rode along the track. In the
morning, the front man was found dead on the
road. His mate declared that he had been shot.
There was under the right arm a wound which
the post-mortem medico declared was just such a
wound as a gardener’s knife would make, and the
living man was a gardener. Chief Justice Forbes,
in summing up, told the jury the old story that
circumstantial evidence was just as good as, if not
better than, direct evidence. The accused was
found guilty and hanged. Twelve months later a
bushranger named Curran was condemned to be
hanged and made a dying confession. In that con-
fession, Curran owned up to the murder of the man
on account of whose death this gardener had been
hanged. He had- potted the front man on the
horse from behind cover. The remains of the
murdered man were exhumed, and the bullet
found in them ! The post-mortem doctor had only
made a perfunctory examination, and had not
known by sight enough to distinguish between a
ball puncture and an incised wound! Says Mr.
Elliott: —
Where was my heart, think you . . . when I found
that I had.been a consenting party to an innocent man’s
death? . . . I vowed never to believe circumstantial
evidence again. Many years afterwards, on a trial at our
Court in Melbourne for murder, the counsel, on opening,
stated the evidence to be adduced was solely circumstan-
tial. I jumped up and told the Judge 1 would not convict
under these circumstances. He patiently listened to me,
and then said, in a determined and stately manner, “ Sit
down, sir, and listen to the evidence ; you have been
sworn.” Fortunately there was no case and I was
relieved. I still think 1 would not have consented to
a second death ; the shock of the first was enough for
a lifetime.
The Bulletin reiterates its oft-repeated argu-
ment against capital punishment-the mistake;
■of that system are irreparable ; their atonement is
impossible.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where. ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is j ust
the place;At is certainly the largest and best-
conducted Jjqom in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionably insert for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
Who gazes deep into her eyes
With fond and soothing manner,
And doses her with am’rous sighs?

To test the temperature,
And sqeezes oft that little fist?
The doctor, to be sure.

Cuttica. On Monday, the light-soprano brand of
1 aust was flashed before the ear-sight of
perspiring audience, and many people-masculine
of course-went out to “sec a man.” During
several sections of the current seven days various
operatic successes were revived, and an entirely
new opera, by the present company, Ihusinlo
“Barber of Seville,” held forth its humour and
its Wit, and its absolute triumph of pure Italian
melody, to an audience whose opinions we have
not yet collated. On Saturday, the Royal
Imperial Republican Australian Italian Operatic
Company repair to the Garrick Theatre, with
“Traviata,” and the scene of their triumphs
welcomes the ever-Bland Holt to Sydney, with a
Pettit production, entitled “ A Sailor’s Knot.”
At Sydney Her Majesty's, George Rignold

Sydney Criterion continues to hold the
mirror up to farcical improbability, and to fill the
house. On Saturday last, Robert Brough, of
legal reputation, dunned the mantle of Haroun
al Raschid, and perambulated the streets as a
nineteenth-century caliph in search of derelict
adventure. After befriending a loud - slurted
female acrobat, with a sore throat, and a per-
sistently locatory mania, he subsided beneath
the roof-treo of his step-mother with a
female too many in his family connections,
and misery ever afterwards. It is now nearly
four years since we last gloated over this
specimen of joy and jugglery, but, to the shame
of our cynicism, it has lost nought of its frivol-
someness. Brough adds an easy perfume to the
violet, and forces one to forget St. Maur of other
days with a dulcet facility befitting a slippery
skating-rink. The new lady, Miss Ida Liston, ia
not altogether Maggie Knight. She does, may-
hap, sing George Lash Gordon’s topical song with
a deal more esprit; but she certainly lacks that
pyrotechnic splendour that enabled the erstwhile
“ gutta-percha girl ” to strike a lucifer on the sole
of a dainty shoe. Cannam, albeit good, is not
“Teddy ” Kqyee, and one misses the unction of a
voice in which humour rolled like “coming”
butter over a churn-flap. Miss Brenda Gibson is
an admirable American niece, who makes us
regret that we have no nieces of that nationality
ourself. Mr. Fabert is a sly-faced and fat
voiced Dobson, reminiscent of many purloined
dishes, and Miss Romer, consummate artiste
as she is, is the only lady on the stage in'
Australia, or anywhere else", capable of being
Hummingtop’s mamma. Likewise Miss Major’s
Barbara, is a servant-girl whom one may make
several ineffective efforts to avoid tipping,

The Coogee Aquarium has added a human
feature to the attractions of the deep, and stalwart-
bipeds meander in vigorous contest without the
marble basin of the show. The Bondi Aquarium
is also open. So likewise is the Polytechnic,
beneath a new management, with a seductive
exhibition of fleas—chained. Other more or less
aggressive places of amusement continue to clang
the tocsin of a whilom delightfulness, and the
fetching Albus sing every Sunday.

Mellow drammer follows mellow drammer
at Melbourne Alexandra, where the remorseless,
treacherous, lecherous, soulless villain of today
is the brave benignant smiler of to-morrow, of
rise versa. By this quick change policy Damp/ 1 '
contrives to keep his connection together, which is
all that a theatrical trader has to live for these
bad times. The gallery boys, in particular, have
good cause for remaining loyal to the old shop.

There is a great opening at the Aleck for anyone


ho can bring out a well-seasoned voice-jujube at
"popular price. The boy who has shouted himself
to a standstill would gladly pay a premium on a
en’orth cf lubricating lollies between the
but no matter. The latest revival is
f. for Gold,” a harrowing narrative adapted
from “The Wandering Jew.” Dampier, in the
time-honoured white wig of Dagobert, has been a
pular institution since the night when Lily and
Ifi) e D- first trotted at his heels in pursuit of 50
millions sterling. The present daughters of
General Simon seem smaller than they used to be,
but they keep the juvenile interest quite alive,
n( j one of them, Little Daphne, is a specially-
intelligent infant. Others of the company, who
ar e not infants, show less intelligence; but, on
‘ t l,e whole, “ All for Gold ” is creditably put
through. A homely supper-scene, in the second
aC t presents a genuine appearance, and the way
j n which Dagobert’s young friends make unre-
hearsed grabs at the black bottle of raspberry
vinegar is full of human nature. There will be a
n e\v thrill on Saturday if necessary.

“Caste,” at the Bijou, proved such a
-weet restorer of jaded business that the manage-
ment decided to give Anson another week in which
t 0 S ay farewell. Consequently Eccles will get
drunk in the bosom of his family, and commit a
nightly burglary upon that stuck-up little beast,
the rag baby, until Friday. The baby is the one
item that doesn’t advance nearer to perfection in
the B. and B. rendering of “Caste.” It never
seems to cut a tooth or try to feel its feet, and a
sorrowful conviction that the wretched impostor
was born without feet, or a face to call its own, is
growing upon an otherwise admiring public.
However, baby must leave the cradle forthwith,
and “Captain Swift,” with Tith. in the name-
part, will be duly produced on Saturday.

“Little Jack Sheppard ” humps his
“bluey” and departs from the Royal about the
same time. The gay marauders have hugged
Bess and Poll with fair success for three weeks,
and the world yearns, as per advt., to see the
winsome Billee Barlow in one more character
before her engagement expires. For which reason
“Randolph the Reckless” is likely to pop up on
Saturday, if he can be brought to the scratch in a
presentable condition by that date. The Ran-
dolph under discussion was originally intended to
be Churchill, but by any other name he is certain
to be reckless. All Randolphs are built that way.

Melbourne Opera House has been freely,
if not lavishly, attended of late, and Carl Hertz
seems to keep the ball rolling better than any
other conjuror who has visited these parts. On
Saturday he struck out in a new direction by
burning a lady alive and reproducing her from the
ashes, so evidently he will be a useful man for any
sinner to know in the great hereafter. The
Graggs are likewise getting further and further
past all understanding with their wonderful legs,
but the day of their departure is nigh. They are
under London engagement to Sir ’Gustus Harris,
a bloated aristocrat who has commanded them
to leave Australia by the next Orient boat, and as
there is no arguing with a proud knight the
Graggs must go. Consequently the Empire Com-
pany will have to be wound up for the present by
about Thursday of next week, leaving the stage
clear for Mrs. Bernard-Beere and her party from
England. The lady will appear first “As In a
Looking Glass,” and uncommonly nice she will
look.
< *
Meanwhile, “La Cigale ” has a fight hold
at the Princess’. The ladies’ orchestra, which was
soothing (when the darlings didn’t play), but very
superfluous, has been dispensed with. Generally
speaking, the first violins suffered from bad head-
aches, and the wind instruments were dreadfully
upset about something George had been saying,
whilst the delusive make-weight damsels, who
really didn’t produce any music at all, were con-
stantly coming over faint and threatening to drop.
In fact, manager Williamson found the ladies’
orchestra such a strain on his constitution that
he is supposed to have ended the matter
by paying them to go into the next street.
The moral of “La Cigale” is still shrouded in
mystery. Flora Graupner, for instance, is alleged
to personify the industrious ant, but seeing that
she wears a white satin dress and occupies her
time with dodging round for a chance to sing, they
might just as well call her an earwig. The low
comedians, Elton and Lauri, are also difficult to
reconcile with any particular meaning, but they
have a good deal to say and are ably supported by
a white donkey, who bears the burden of their
long yam in the market-place without kicking.

Melbourne theatres, by the way, are feeling
the effects of Exhibition Concerts every Saturday
night. The three halls are still locked in a death-
struggle, each claiming to be wiping-out the other
two. At the Waxworks, they have got the clever
Japanese troupe, lately with Frank Clark, whilst
the Aquarium is relying to a great extent upon
its raging alligator, and the Cycloramas are
Progressing as usual.

A Bathurst practical joker, the other evening, thought
would be rare fun to let down, among an amateur
Operatic company that was performing on the stage at

tew nights later. But he undid the wrong rope, and let
8° with a run a huge beam to which the gas-jets were
attached. Result; Two people badly hurt'; Miss Caples
narrowly escaped death ; Miss Archer swooned with
h'ght; and the joker himself fainted with fear. He is to
prosecuted.
Billy Swords, the Melbourne amateur, was acting Sol-
dering Solomon, the raiser tinker, in “ Rory O'More,”
and emerged from his cave hugging his “ Go-o-ld !
go-o-ld!” in a handkerchief, but it burst and scattered old
bits of china all over the stage—after all, the profoundest
millionaire moral.
Real lightning is introduced on the German stage, and
answers so well that it will soon be universal. Yet they
don’t come up to Lola Montes, at Bendigo, according to
the yarn, acting in “Asmodeus, or the Little Devil,”
when a thunderstorm burst overhead and lightning
shivered a plank of the stage. Lola coolly remarked to the
manager, “ Your effects in this piece are very creditable.”
Perhaps Anson’s Eccles is the best ever seen. George
Honey, the original, gave a tinge of burlesque to every-

wash them?” innocently asked his wife.

There are even the Byronio burlesques, in which Rose
Edouin acted, as a girl, at Coppin’s little wooden
Pantheon Theatre, Oremorne, Melb., over 30 years ago—
but, then, look at Farren ! Under-study to Ninon de

Charles Warner, in the Xmas number of The Theatre,
exhumes the narrative of Federici’s death descending the
trap as Mephistopheles, at Melbourne Princess’s. The
regular theatrical death to trot out in these reminiscences
is that of John Palmer,who fell dead on the stage, while
acting the “Stranger,” but it was not at the words “There
is another and better world,” which are, of course, always
picked out of the play, as the most apt. Fullon died on
the Dublin stage, just walking off at the wing, as Sir
Peter Teazle.
Mrs. Bernard Beere’s complimentary benefit at London
Haymarket netted £4OO. Of the gentlemen who accom-
pany her, says The Bulletin's correspondent, you will
be sure to like Herbert Standing, who, in addition to
being a sound actor, is a real good all-round man, who
can take his own part at anything. He is a pretty rough
’un with the mittens. He is a brother of Frank Celli,
the well-known baritone. It is to be hoped that Marius
will receive a welcome, for he is a merry and amusing
fellow. It is generally admitted that he was treated
badly by Florence St John, who wanted to get rid of him
at any cost. It was not his fault that the affair came into
court.
When Johnny Solomon thought of a name for his
Sydney theatre, years ago, he selected “Bijou.” One
day a Semitic friend asked him what was to be the name
of the house. “ The Bee Jew,” replied Johnny. “Don’t,
Solomon, too many call us ‘B —— Jews’ already 7, and
this is only encouraging ’em. Call it something else.”
And sure enough, Johnny did—he called it the
“ Criterion.”
Theatrical management, says the gallant Coppin, would
be very pleasant if all “stars” we® like Billee Barlow.
Yet Miss Billee is not a radiant star when you come to
consider her seriously. She sings a comic song distinctly
in a fairly musical voice, she dances very little and very
seldom, she speaks her rhymed fines quite mechanically,
not to say monotonously, when there are several to be
spoken at a stretch. Billee’s strong points are her fine
appearance, music-hall chic, and infectious air of festivity
and good humour.

One of Sells’ elephants caused a consternation when
the show was leaving Adelaide. The Jumbo wanted to
eat a piestall, proprietor included, but the latter dis-
appeared, leaving the pies to their fate. The elephant
tasted one—and left.
Sells Brothers say they had the biggest houses of their
tour in Adelaide, and the Adelaide profits averaged
better than anywhere. The partners are very wroth
about the Sydney authorities quarantining their horses.
They say the horses were in good order, and that they
have since been re-shipped to America, under a clean bill
of health.
Melbourne Royal management has, it appears, lost
£5741 in the past six months, £4OOO of the debit being
due to Laura Villiers and her gruesome failures. Only
the pantomime and “Jack Sheppard” have shown any
profit since the restored theatre started business. In
other words the house never began to prosper until the
Age withdrew its “ support.”
Marie Halton, putting little pleasantries on one side,
changed her name and estate not so very long since.
Sells’ Circus, in its progress through Victoria, is buying
up all kinds of Australian curiosities, for the Chicago

Why can’t the Italian Operatists give us Mascagni’s

Dampier puts up the “Wandering Jew” again, in
Melbourne, with his Dagobert. When he first came to
Melbourne, Rose and Lily were infantile, but he went
away for some years, and reappeared with them as
the two children in the “Wandering Jew, or All For
Gold.” The public was, of course, much interested.
Manning was not so rough on the theatre, towards the

Consider how the glorious prestige the Theatre
Royal, Melbourne, has been destroyed ! The house of
G. V. Brooke and Barry Sullivan, of which it was said
that nothing good came out of any other Nazareth.
J. O. Williamson is in evidence as a shareholder of Mel-
bourne Theatre Royal Proprietary Co., and heckled
Coppin at the meeting last week. He denies that W. G.
and M. purposely destroyed the Royal.
It’s hard to tell this yarn of the celebrated John
Edwards the Younger, in Melbourne. An English pro-
vincial actor, ofhumble rank, used to be very frowsy in
his ways, but went to America and made a rise. He came
back full of cash and says to his old manager, “ Cully ! I’ll
star a night or two, but won’t take anything, because I’m
lozy with money.” “Yes,” replied the boss, “and I
knew you when you were lozy without money.”
The alterations of Melbourne Royal cost £BOOO, and the
business loss on the half year is £sooo—£l3,ooo,total, if
you like to put it that way.

Carl Hertz has notices posted up behind Melbourne
Opera House scenes, warning that the stage must be kept
clear, of all save his confederates, during his performance,
and Frank Emery Sees to it rigorously. All this starts
the tongues wagging with full explanations. It is incon-
venient for a wizard not to have his own stage.
Was it Lord Salisbury? George Honey, the original
Eccles, was not one of the snobby comedians, like .
He presided at a social club, where a member was a noble
lord, who had lately emerged from the chrysalis of
literary Bohemianism into millionairism. A gorgeous
flunkey stepped into the club to inform his lordship that
the carriage waited, but Honey, in the chair, severely
reprimanded the nobleman, who humbly apologised.

One hundred pounds was the price paid to Jude for his
song “ A Hundred Fathoms Deep ” —a pound a fathom—
and it was written in a night.
Organist Jude is evidently “struck” with Tasmania,
his departure for Maoriland having been announced some
weeks before his second “farewell” performance at
Hobart. He has given several “farewells” since then,
fetching larger audiences each successive time.
Charles Warner, in a theatrical paper, narrates a curious
thing. Graoie made her first stage appearance, as Juliet
to his Romeo, balcony scene, at his farewell benefit,
Drury Lane, leaving for Australia. A wealthy gentleman,
attending the show, got mashed on her, but an adven-
turess persuaded him that she herself acted the part,
being Warner’s sister, and Graoie did not go on, through
stage fright. She showed him all her faded wreaths,
whereupon he married her, and has now gone to the
asylum. Warner has no sister, but has a brother, and a
strapping son.
From next June Brough and Boucieault’s head-quarters

The Melbourne Ladies Orchestra in La Cigale, at Mel-

Why don’t Coppin come out for a week, as Paul Pry,
Aminadab Sleek, and the Artful Dodger? At the share-
holders’ meeting, one overhauled him as to what he did
at the Royal. He said he called in every morning, and
saw the heads of departments, but this isn’t the way
Coppin used to work, or that Williamson works, or B. and
8., or anybody without a compauy.
Another good man gone! The “Babes in the Wood’
did it. A popular Sydney acting-manager, hitherto
supposed to be proof against the wiles of the fair, has
succumbed. The happy day is not as yet officially
announced.
Bertram, the conjurer, was doing some card tricks, one
night recently, at the Savage Club (London), when
Christie Murray rose up with a look of cold derision in
his eye and wanted to show the audience “ how it was
done.” There was such an air of lofty disdain about him
that the conjurer got mad and “ went for him.” Before
Murray could get fairly started with his exposure, cards
began to fall out of him in all directions—down the legs
of his pants, off the top of his head, down his cuffs—
everywhere. Then the conjurer (who was sitting at the
other end of the room) proposed that Murray and Sandow
(the strong man) should divide a pack of cards between
them. They did it, and Bertram waved his hands in the
air, and ten of Murray’s cards vanished right there, and
turned up in Sandow’s pocket. Then more cards began
falling out of Murray’s clothes, and the dogmatic author
retired in disgust, without exposing anybody. He was
probably afraid if he held his ground much longer that
his clothes would fly off him and he would be left standing
up in the middle of the room a naked novelist.
Next year is the centenary of the Mar-
seillaise.
The Victorian Art students at Melbourne
Gallery still complain of having to draw the
human form divine from the heifer.
It is asserted by several English news-
papers that Lord Carington is not so acceptable a
guest at Marlborough House as he used to be.
When Bob Lowe, now Lord Sherbrooke,
was in Sydney in the .forties, he was a firebrand
orator, and was at one time posted up in the
Australian Club by Broadhurst as having been
guilty of “ slander and cowardice, redoubled by
deliberate falsehoods.”
Marquis of Lome, the Canadian vice-regal
failure, has been appointed Governor and Con-
stable of Windsor at £l2OO a year, with about
£lOOO extra pickings, besides his £6OOO-a-yea r

once, leech always, is the royal rule.
A man out rowing on Sydney harbour the
other day, between Dobroyd Hoad and the
Quarantine-ground, saw in the water a snake,
which swam for the boat, and which he killed
with a paddle and secured. It was a venomous
brown land-snake and measured sft. Din. Our
Beautiful Harbour !
Part of an extempore prayer for Wales,
by the Rev. John Robertson, in the Free Gorbals’
Church, Glasgow, Scotland :
The Lord make this bereavement (Clarence’s death) a
thinking time for him (Wales), and may he stop his horse-
racing and all going to doubtful places, &c., &c.
Good old extempore!
W. H. Campbell, the defeated squattophile
candidate for the Barcoo, W.Q., tried to ensure
his return by promising loudly that he would
advocate the unconditional release of the unionists
now incarcerated in St. Helena penal establish-
ment for alleged rioting and conspiracy. But the
Labour voters were not to be “had” that way,
and secured his rejection by 200 votes. The
victory of the shearers’ party is a good omen for
the coming great struggle.
The story of the Larkin-Cleary jury.
When the jury retired, six were for a conviction,
five for an acquittal, and one for a disagreement.
One juror said—“ Look here, Mat Larkin did me
a good turn. He flung his money about like a
prince, he did ; and I’ll be (asterisked) if I’ll pot
him—(dash-blank) the (thisanthat) evidence.’
Three jurymen held that a cheque which Larkin
received, as part of land proceeds, was the return
of a loan. Reappearing before the Judge, that
theory was exploded. Next, the acquittal men
took the ground that Cleary was only a tool of
Larkin, and that therefore there could be no
“conspiracy” (of which precise offence the
prisoners were accused). Had there been an
acquittal, a detective stood ready in court to arrest
the two men again on fresh and separate charges.
So the jury disagreed.
Sowclen, chief of the S.A. Register
reporting-staff, takes up F. W. Ward’s vacated
position in London as cablegrammer to the
Associated Australian newspapers. Each paper
contributing to the cable-fund nominates a man in
turn. First the Age nominated Phil. Mennell;
then Sydney D.T. nominated F. W. Ward ; now
it is Adelaide’s turn. The post is aby no means
desirable one, and gives a man the life of a dog.
. Its holder has to arise every day before three a.m.,
at which time cabling begins ; any messages not
in before 5.30 reach Australia too late for that
day’s publication. Then one has three masters to
please in three different provinces, and each snarls
fiercely unless his own province is given special
prominence in the news, to obtain which all sorts
of expedients have to be resorted to. By the way,
the present Melbourne attempt at newspaper
coalition is founded to no small extent on a deter-
mination on the part of the leading newspaper-
proprietors to get a cable-monopoly and squelch
all competition.

“ Griffith is the greatest political mounte-

hung. Griffith is hung—hung over the fence.
Should a prisoner, tendering his evidence
under the new law permitting the examination on
oath of arraigned persons, be allowed to enter the
witness-box, or should he be sworn in the dock?
Judge Docker (N.S.W.) says that no prisoner
should be allowed to leave the dock. Judges
Backhouse and Coffey, on the other hand, treat an
accused man as an ordinary witness. They are
right. Every man is legally innocent until proved
guilty. If you are going to sw T ear a man behind
the spikes, why should you not allow the Crown
Prosecutor to open proceedings by tendering to
the jury a list of his previous convictions? Any
witness compelled to give evidence from a
prisoner’s dock—the symbol to an ordinary jury-
man’s mind of crime and depravity—is almost
hopelessly handicapped. Every accused man is
entitled to a fair trial, and, in view of that prin-
ciple, one cannot help asking why a man should
be caged like a wild beast until after he has been
convicted.
Melbourne Age professes to discover that
the Victorian Civil Service is overmanned by just
3077 servants ; lays down the law that, as officers
retire by effluxion of time, all new appointments
“must absolutely cease” until the service is
reduced to a maximum of 10,000 persons; says
that .£20,000 a year can be saved in the Govern-
ment Printing Office, another £20,000 a year by
abolishing the Public Service Board with a view
to having its duties performed by the Audit Com-
missioners (as originally proposed by Mr. Service),
estimates a possible saving in the railway depart-
ment by reduction of train mileage and working
expenses, at £500,000, and finds a total of
£911,000 per annum which it is within the power
of a resolute Government to “ retrench,” without
inflicting injustice either on the Civil Service or on
the public.

POLITICAL POINTS
Where land is dear, men are cheap.”—
Rolf Boldrewood.
The introduction of cheap Italian failures
for the sugar-plantations lias already cost the
Bananaland Treasury =£15,000.
The soi-dimnt democratic Australian
Star advocates nigger-labour in Queensland and
the private ownership of the N.S.W. State tram-
ways !
Woe to the poor Melbourne cleric in a
“big” office who dares to say “No” when hi?
lord and master asks him if he belongs to the
Young Victorian party.
It has been formally resolved by the local
Council of Mackay (Q.) that alderman Hynes,
who was due for the office in rotation, is unfit to
be local Mayor because he is a Republican.
The Queensland Agent-General has been
instructed by Premier Griffilwraith to stop all
emigration from England to Queensland. The
darned place is wanted for Griffilwraith’s Kanakas.
By a happy coincidence, Parkes’ plea for
the Imperial brand of Federation was directly
followed by an announcement from the Chair that
Dibbs’ Tariff Bill had passed tiie gauntlet of the
N.S.W. Legislature.
Does the acceptance by Mr. Robert Smith,
of Norton, Smith and Co., of the position of
solicitor to the N.S.W. Railway Commissioners,
affect his partner (Mr. Norton’s) seat as a member
of the Legislative Council?
The small Commons majority against
Welsh church endowment means "that that
monstrous robbery of the taxpayer by the Church
of England is doomed. Its death-knell was the
Irish Church disendowment.
Mildura (Vic.) irrigation colony started as
a prohibition settlement and then began to irri-
gate with “sly” grog. Prosecutions followed.
Now a local paper calls for a poll to settle the
liquor-question by a majority ballot.
No Australian Federation without One-
man-one-vote. Under One-man-one-vote Queens-
land can free herself from coloured labour;
without One-man-one-vote the nigger and his
employers will sit upon the workman’s chest.
Why should not constitutional rights and
politics form subjects to be included in the curri-
culum of public schools ? Let Australian natives,
at any rate, be so educated that they shall in-
stinctively record their votes democratically.
Dr. £ £ Smith is one of the prominent
“ thrift-vote ” men in the Victorian Parliament.
The doctor apparently doesn’t like manhood
suffrage; he makes his living by “ lost manhood ”
suffrage. “ Don’t you feel well, young man ?”
The ’BB elections in Queensland resulted
in the return of GO members (out of a total of 72)
distinctly pledged to oppose the employment of
coloured labour. Those pledges would still be
binding, if honour were a guiding principle in
politics. If!
Labour-Member Glassey thinks there are
enough members in Bananaland Assembly to
defeat Griffith’s black-labour designs. lie relies
chiefly on the Ipswich and Darling Downs
bunches, who are believed to be earnestly opposed
to the slave-trade.
The latest idea which Parkes has cribbed
without acknowledgment, is the bill of Tasmania’s
Republican A ttorney-Gcneral to elect a conven-
tion on the parliamentary franchise to knock the
Commonwealth Bill on the head. Parkes carries
Inglis Clark’s bill in his pocket.
Mayor Hutchinson, of Gympie, refused to
call a public meeting to consider Griffil wraith’s
black labour manifesto “because the matter was a
debateable one ” and also because he “didn’t feel
justified in convening a meeting to condemn the
fiead of the Government.” Poor sheep !
“Down with the agitator!” says a Mel-
bourne parson, but where would the workman be
■without the agitator? Yes, the agitator with
leisure to read, and find out how labour is put
upon. Without such, the Sixteen Hour Grinder
will ever be a slave. God bless the Agitator !
“The N.S.W. plural-vote party will win.”
Never! Cast your memory back to the ever-
rnemorable Grey meeting at Sydney Centennial
Hall—the biggest and most enthusiastic political
gathering ever held within walls in Australasia.
Dare the plural-voters come out into the day-
light ! J
Having established a State manual-labour
bureau, the N.S.W. Ministers now refuse to
receive written applications for State employment
at “ hard graft.” But will they similarly refer to
the clerical labour bureau (i.e., the Civil Service
Board) all applications for clerical employment?
No fear.
The petitions against the Dibbs Tariff Bill
cost the Calico-Jemmy party a nice little sum.
In Sydney Is. per 100 was paid for signatures.
The petitions, G 2 in all, bore 02,005 names ; and as
each person signed say six times on an average the
wail emanated from 10,494 persons, the bulk qf
whom were women and minors.
Victoria has had, under Responsible
Government, 16 Premiers—“ Jimmy ” M'Culloch,
holding office four times, O’Shannassy thrice, Berry
thrice, Haines twice, Service twice ; Nicholson,
Heales, Sladen, Macpherson, Duffy, Francis,
Kerferd, O’Lqughlin, Gillies, Munro, and Shiels
once each. Eight of these are now dead.
Premier Griffith’s stock argument against
N.Q. separation used to be that its promoters
were secretly determined to reintroduce black-
labour into their area. Now that Griffith is
reviving the Kanaka on his own account, what
fresh excuse will he concoct to bolster up his con-
tinued opposition to Northern separation ?
Rockhampton Bulletin hits them on the
point of the chin: —
It is not the sugar industry or the permanent advan-
tage of Queensland that is the real object of this new
(black-labour) movement, hut the temporary increase of
land-values in Brisbane, to admit of a few speculators
escaping from the clutches of their late gamble.
W. M. Fail-land, championing Queensland
nigger-labour, endeavours to buttress Ins position
by asserting that he has “seen young, strong,
Irish immigrants,” landed into N.Q. plantations,
to break up soil which has laid them speedily low

with malaria. This is just as true of the Kanakas,
as is clearly shown by the Northern nigger-
mortality tables.
Brewer Toohey, M.L.A., wants £2OOO
damages from Melville, ex-corpse-planter and
chairman of committees, because the latter caused
him to be removed out of the N.S.W. Assembly.
If Toohey can prove that it is worth £2OOO to be
in that Assembly, then he ought to get the money,
for he was put out without any possible shadow
of doubt whatever.
Ninian Melville’s hold on the Chairman-
ship of the N.S.W. Assembly is becoming very
weak. His peremptory expulsion of memberToohey
for insisting on his clear right, as the Speaker
admitted, to state a point of order, called forth an
indignant cry of “Shame” from all sections of
the Chamber. The ex-undertaker forgets that
members aren’t mutes.
Dan O’Connor says he “has yet to learn
that under any exigencies honour and dignity have
to be sacrificed at the shrine of ixpadiency.”
This is the distinguished M.L.C. and extinguished
M.L. A, who accepted £l5OO per annum at the
hands of the man whom he had been denouncing
for years as “Charlatan,” “Mountebank,” and
“ Upas-tree,” and whom he afterwards fulsomely
described in bell-metal as “Great Parkes ! ”
“ Steward, a bucket.”
The mutterings begin of the U.S. Pre-
sidential struggle. The election is always on the
Tuesday after the first Monday ill November,
Leap-year, in all the States, and the Inauguration
is in March. Ex-presidents Hayes and Cleveland
survive, the former aged 70. Perhaps M‘Kinley
will pop up, but it’s always a surprise. Why not
a second term for Harrison ?
“Give the squatters permanent occupation,
under whatever title, of their immense runs; give
their creatures in the Legislative Council the
control of the Crown lands—then may Australia
bid farewell to greatness, freedom, happiness for
centuries to come,” were almost the last words
which W. A. Duncan wrote for his Weekly
Register, the old Sydney weekly in which Parkes’
early “poems” first saw the light.
Victoria spends £7;000,000 in liquor
annually, and the Age strongly urges Premier
Shiels to adopt the Norwegian system of a State
liquor-monopoly thus ensuring close conti’ol and
abolition of abnormal incentives to make people
drink. This, it is claimed, would shrink the pro-
vincial grog-bill to £5,000,000, and (calculating on
20 per cent, profit) put £1,000,000 annually into
the Treasury without extra taxation.
When the Legislative Assembly (Q.) was
invited three years ago “ to adopt some means for
encouraging the sugar industry,” demagogue
Griffith moved'a proviso, to the’effect that the
“ mean.4 ’’ should not involve “-a re-opening of
the 1 coloured'labott'r question.” Suppose the issue
at next election's’ is freedom’ versus slavery, will
Lilley step tlc/wii frOm'thfe'Be'rtch, and .shatter the

The total population of Australasia (in-
cluding the Maoris) verges on four millions-

675,775.
A Perth (W.A.) firm, anxious to sell some
blocks of land, publishes the following advertise-
ment
It will be seen at a glance what the effect of these works
will be: thousands of people will flock to the scenes of
operation, every branch of work and industry will be
opened, houses will spring up in every direction, and
possessors of land will hold the key of the situation.
Henry George never summed the matter up more
clearly.
“ What Australia wants,” says Booth, “is
a strong Government, morality, religion, people
who would work, and regular immigration in
connection with settling people on the land.”
Which is Booth’s humble way of saying that it
requires a despot in a red shirt, more hallelujah
and big drum, more collections—Booth to tai-
care of the cash, and his accounts not to i' 6
audited, the sweating system as practised in t)
Salvation colonies in England, and all the a r ,J 6
land to be given away gratis to Booth, in a n ( Lj?
trust for Salvation paupers.

“ Colonial politicians,” says the Financial
News, concerning the trouble between Treasurer-
McTlwraith and the Bank of England, “ must be
taught that they cannot malign the financial,
institutions of England with impunity.” ah
right! If the Bank of England can’t block the
Queensland conversion loans then it has been'
maligned with impunity. If it can and does
then Queensland will probably stop payment, and!
the British lender will go bung, and the province,,
will save an awful lot of money, and the row that
ensues will hurry on separation. Australia willi
be uppermost either way. Let the Bank go richt-
ahead. °
If sufficient subscriptions are not for tin.
coming Booth declares that “he will borrow the.
money at 3J per cent., and then transfer the sm-.
plus population to Australia or elsewhere, and it
he can’t borrow the money lie will get it some-
other way.” Booth is plainly a bigger ass tham
he looks. For, in the first place, he won’t trans-
fer his surplus population to Australia unless he-
can fight his way with his trombone against ai
continent in arms. Also, he won’t borrow at 3b
per cent., for no one can be rnad enough to lendi
on the security of a jersey and a drum ; and if be-
gets the cash “some other way ” he must steal it
and then he will get into gaol.
£641,930 is the exact amount of the “uin-
authorised expenditure,” by the Barkes Govern-
ment during their last year of office in N.B.W
One of the items is £405 for a bust of Lord!
Salisbury. Was N.S.W. really in such a hurry'
for Salisbury’s bust that Barkes couldn’t wait to,
get the item sanctioned by Parliament? This i Si
another of the evil consequences of party govern-
ment. The Freetraders couldn’t object to Salis-
bury’s bust because if they raised a protest against,
that melancholy image it meant Protection. And!

mining factor, amidst all the split-up factions* im
the approaching Victorian parliamentary elections.,
I hat association and the labour-party are (tl»
most reliably organised of the crowd of sections,
now seething in the political cauldron of tfe*

Mr. Robert Harper, is busily underground-
tunnelling ; the new Young “Patriots” (bank-
clerks and toadies) League rather fancies its own
mixed personnel ; the country party has. a wide
drag-net; and the local optionists can breathe
politics loudly enough—but each of these com-
binations will fall to pieces after the elections,
being composed of two heterogeneously diverse
constituent particles ; so that, even should one of
them score a win, the victory would be of no use
to it. The A.N.A. will indirectly and almost
unconsciously help Breipjpr Sliiels, who is himself

The “.Death Watch.”
A HOUSEHOLD FEST WHICH MAKES,
UNCANNY NOISES.
\\ ho has not heard the “ death watch ?”■ Many
a person who has happened to be awake- in the--
rtillness of the night has listened to the tick, tick :
tor half a dozen times or more in succession as •
regular and as natural as the ticking of a clock..
Many have regarded the sound with superstitious s
awe and dread, because everything about it is -son
mysterious. The name death, watch is derived inn
this way, as a person sitting up with the sick isis
more apt to hear such sounds, and when thfeyy
were heard at such times,, it was considered an ilkl-
omen to the sick one.. Some intrepid persona
dared to brave this messenger of,death, and found,!
instead of the supposed spirit* a guileless*.timid!
little insect. However, the name is still.- retained!,
and no doubt many still wonder what makes that
peculiar sound and why it is made. It is wonder-
ful that the mere tick, tick, tick of this harmless
insect should cause such fear and dread m some
people’s minds, who are generally so apathetic in
the matter of the serious signs of approaching
catastrophe, that spitting of phlegm in the morn-
ing, dull aching feeling in the head, eyes, and

Miss M. Wignall, 4(> Fen wick-street, North
Carlton, Melbourne, who writes: “During the
last seven years 1 have suffered dreadfully irom
neuralgia, passing many sleepless nights of agony
in consequence. So much had the pain interfered
with my general health that I had wasted away
to a shadow, many of my friends thinking I was
consumptive. I tried all kinds of remedies with-
out success until I used Clements Tonic, of which
the first bottle gave me instant relief, and I feel
that Clements 1 onic is thoroughly rt invigorating
my whole system, giving me a good appetite and
relish for food, and I have therefore much pleasure
in endorsing the merits of Clements Tonic.

Ex-Governor Onslow says Baron Carington
was “ the most popular Governor Australia has
ever had.” Not quite true. What is true is that
Carington was the greatest and shallowest popu-
larity-hunter who ever struck this country.
Henniker Heaton is coming out. He and
two other men have offered to guarantee _ the
British Government against the loss, officially

In his paper on the “ Heralds of Australian
Literature,” Rolf Boldrewood told Ids audience
that Sir James Martin was a contributor to the
Atlas and Empire in 1848. The Atlas expired
in 1848, and the first number of the Empire did
appear until 1850.
Cardinal Manning was indirectly connected
with the Carington family—this way. His
mother-in-law, Mrs. Sargent, was daughter of
Mr. Smith, brother of the one created Lord
Carrington. The Sargent family were all ricketty,
addicted to dying young.
Young Freemantle, who commanded the
gunboat “Plucky” when a couple of fishing-
smacks were sunk off Plymouth by stray shots, is

When Parkes broke his leg he, as soon as
he had been medically overhauled, sent off a mes-
sage to Parliament House that no one was to
occupy the seat of the “Prime Minister” (that is
what he used to call himself) during his enforced
absence. And no one did !
“’Any” Fitts, of Melbourne (num de
thedtrc, Atkinson), is billed in the pantomime at
Birmingham Theatre Royal as “ tlie Australian
Orpheus.” Atkinson is making money, and has
no reason to regret the days when he was a clerk
in Lorimer’s Melbourne office.
Among those to whom the N.S \V. Crown-
Solicitorship was nnavailingly offered at -£2OOO a
year was the well-known Mr. “ Teddy ” Simpson,
of Johnson, Simpson, Minter and Co. E.P.S.
would probably be justified in valuing his personal
professional services at <£sooo annually.
G. N. Taylor, the Land Credit Bank
manager, was a “ thrifty ” man, and had votes in
three electorates. Although Taylor embezzled
over .£lOO,OOO, he was only prosecuted for using
two almost worthless bills. For this he received
the highest penalty the law could give, viz., two
years’ imprisonment!
W, H. A. Crowe, who graduated from a
shearing board at Bourke to a clerkship in the
N.S.W. Pastoralists’ Union office, has just in-
herited <£30,000, and turns out to be the son of an
English lord. He is off “Home,” no doubt to
marry the girl he left weeping on some British
quay ever so long ago.
In a notice of the Duke of Edinburgh, one
of the society papers has quite a pathetic re-
ference. On his Victorian travels, he put up at
the demesne of Squatter Austin, and was so tired
that he fell asleep on the shoulder of a young lady
next him at dinner. How royal! That shoulder
lias been religiously preserved.
ONE WAY TO RAISE THE WIND.
DIPSOMANIAC: “ Look ’ere, you buy ole gold, I b’lieve ?”
DEALER: “Yes, we do.”
DIPSOMANIAC: “ Well I’ve got some to shell. You shee, I’ve been treated for dip’shmania by
the—hie—bi-chloride of gold treatment for shome time, ’nd there musht be s’
mush gold in my shystem that I ought to be—hie-well worth meltin’ down when
I’ve gon’t’ better world. Wat’l yer give for me in advance? ”
When the late Sir John Hay was first
elected for the Murrumbidgee, he sent a circular
to every elector whose name appeared on the roll,
making enquiries as to local wants. One man of
the large number that replied asked for “a bridge
across the creek to hotel, cis it is.too far to be
walking five miles round to the ferry whenever
you want a drink.”
Apropos the Ninian Melville - Toohey
quarrel in N.S.W. Assembly. When the former
was an auctioneer and was about to hold a small
suburban sale “ the talent ” amongst the dealers
began to chaff, whereupon Melville declared he
would have no noise and sent for a constable to
clear the room. Imagine an auction-sale without
chaff, and minus an audience ! Ninian is a
teetotaller. “No teetotaller can be a successful
auctioneer,” says Walter Bradley.
R. L. Stevenson, the novelist, is still at
Samoa. Things are looking more unhealthy
every year in the South Sea Islands, and if he
stays there long enough his last novel—the one he
writes just before his funeral—will have a huge
sale. What a rush there would be for a book by
one of the most popular writers alive, with his
portrait—in the last stages of leprosy—opposite
the title-page, and a preface stating how, his
manuscript was disinfected before going to the
printer ! If Stevenson doesn’t want to see a most
unhealthy demand for that final work he had
better clear out.
When the late District Judge Callaghan
came to N.S. Wales as a young barrister, he used
to attend the Quarter Sessions held in the Southern
District. On one occasion he had a brief to defend
a man charged with horse-stealing, then a very
prevalent offence. The case against accused was
very weak, and Crown Prosecutor Cheeke intended
to enter a nolle prosequi. Hearing jof this, Cal-
laghan went to him and asked him to put the man
on his trial, pointing out that it would give him a
great lift if his first sessions case should result in
an acquittal. The case being so doubtful, and
the man being defended, and therefore (as he
thought) not likely to suffer, Cheeke consented.
He was accordingly tried and, despite poor Tom’s
eloquence, was convicted. This was a joke against
Callaghan until his dying day.
“Arabi, the Egyptian,” when he went
into captivity in Ceylon at the behest of England
and her usurers, was a tab, well-proportioned,
erect man of soldierly bearing, with but the
merest shimmer of frost on his short, strong beard.
Now, after eight years of exile, he is round-
shouldered and flabby, saturated with malaria, his
limbs rheumatically crippled, his beard and hair
white. At the age of 51, he presents the appear-
ance of a man of 70. Asked why he didn't go
into the hills, he excused himself on the score of
poverty. He is allowed .£5O a month, paid by
Egypt, out of which .£25 a month is deducted for
the maintenance of Ins wife and family in Egypt;
then his eldest son, also in Ceylon, takes .£l2 10s.
a month, and Arabi lives on the balance also
.£l2 10s. a month. He states that he is unable to
give his children the education they ought to
receive. Lord Dufferin originally certified to
<£2ooo a year on Ai'abi’s account, but tire allow-
ance was “ retrenched ” to £OOO.
One of the Sydney quack bankers who
failed the other day had £6OOO on deposit for two
young ladies, all they had in the world.
Apropos of the fact that an “ Inspector of
Rifle Ranges ” has just been appointed by the
N.S.W. Government, at a salary of £2OO a-year,
with travelling allowances, people are asking
why the Inspector of Musketry can’t inspect the
rifle-ranges, and is that not necessarily part of his
duties? Is not Captain Cuthill’s claim being
jumped?
The bulk of the sheep-shearing in Hawke s
Bay, M.L., is done by Maori labour. They en-
thusiastically joined the Shearers’ Union last
season, but backed out when they learned that a
fee was a necessary concomitant of membership.
Very pertinently does a Melbourne jour-
nalist ask whether a paid magistrate is lit to
adjudicate on fraud summonses, when he has
lately been had up on one himself. the
writer is acute, too, in surmising that the beak
will err rather on the side of severity than mercy,
from fear, which will outweigh sympathy. Draco
in Queer-street!
The Ahgus, in one part, says that the
unemployed won’t take work if it is offered them,
and in another, publishes a telegram from Donald
(where a new railway is being surveyed), stating
that many men have walked from Melbourne, a
distance of 180 miles, in order to be on the spot
when the work is started. The worst of it is that
it has been decided to engage labourers in Mel-
bourne, so that these men will be left out in the
cold. “Move on!”
The Young Victorian Patriotic League is
a sucking Tory attempt to incorporate “ patriot-
ism ” with proputty. The league pipes forth, in
its childish treble, a list of the principles and
institutions that every citizen must respect, and
if he thinks the principles are narrow and the
institutions rotten, then he can’t be a patriot.
Nobody objects seriously to the league claiming
the monopoly of a large word any more than they
felt offended' when Parkes moved the resolution
that N.S.W. was Australia. If stockbroker
Mendell and his friends called themselves the
Young Victorian Idiotic League, it wouldn’t
follow that the idiots in the asylums were not
entitled to their old name.
“ Many of the English marry in order to

A Brisbane (Q.) Irishman objected to the
Irish tug-of-war team thei’e. lie said: “Shure,

The London cableman has evidently been
dining with Doctor Blank, of Melbourne, other-
wise why should we be told at breakfast that
(cheap and good advt.) the latter is “investigating
the dipsomania question?” The question now is,
who is Doctor Blank, and does he mean to run a
drunkard’s home at so much a week when he gets
back to Australia?
Dear Bulletin,—On December 4th or sth
last some drovers found the body of a man stuck
in the fork of a tree in the Boyan River, a few
miles below Gongolgon, at a place called The
Pink Hills. There was a deep wound in the fore-
head, and the skull was broken in. People in the
vicinity have often wondered if an enquiry was
held, and, if so, the decision arrived at by the
officiating J.P. or Coroner. One thing is plainly
evident—the drovers who found the body have
never been called upon to testify in the matter.
Simpson, accountant of the South Mel-
bourne Building Society, told the usual building
society story when he got into the witness-box to
testify against that fallen saint, Matthias Larkin.
Loans were granted, he said, in a loose and
general sort of way by the manager or the secre-
tary, or anybody, and sometimes the directors
were consulted, and quite as often they were not.
Sometimes there was security and sometimes there
was none ; a lot of the alleged debts duo to the
society were entirely bogus, and though the
auditors drew their fees regularly, and handed in
their certificate that all was correct, there had
been no audit for years. As far as concerned the
shareholders’ interests the society might, it seemed,
as well have been managed by an octopus and
audited by a corpse.
A movement is afoot among certain
Sydney newspaper proprietors and master-printers
to effect a reduction of the current wages of
compositors. A meeting of typos, was held the
other night, convened by a “rat” printer who is
said to be a past-master in such negotiations, and
the result is boastingly stated to have been that
between 50 and GO comps, have expressed their
readiness to accept, as a “stab” rate of wages,
£2 15s. per week —a clear reduction, on “stab,” of
ss. per week —and something like £'2 a week
less than can be regularly earned, “ by the thous-
and,” by a competent frame-holder on any daily.
The proprietary of the Australian Star we hear,
has declined to listen to the proposals of the “ra t ’
negotiator, and has expressed its complete satis-
faction with existing rates.
It is recorded, on absolutely unimpeach-
able authority, that during the great French
Revolution and the Reign of Terror which
followed it, when the king and queen were
executed, and heads fell like tiles, and nine
nations were making simultaneous war upon
France, that there were a few peaceful old fossil
citizens who lived on in the remote parts of the
Parisian suburbs, and didn’t know there was any
revolution at all. These quiet, clam-like in-
habitants pottered along in their gardens, and
grew their vegetables, and only learned by acci-
dent, when it was all over, that the greatest row
in the world’s history had been going on all round
them, and they hadn’t noticed it. After that it
seems quite credible that there should be various
aged inhabitants in N.S. Wales who never heard
even of Parkes, We met one of them once. He
was a placid old farmer near Bankstown, and he
livid by a primeval system of barter, swopping
His hay with a man at Parramatta for provisions.
He didn’t go in with it himself, being averse to
the madding crowd, but his son acted as Lis
agent. The old man didn’t much like the
arrangement, being under the impression that the
fortnightly visit to Parramatta would make the
youth a wild, dissipated man of fashion, but he
wouldn’t face the job himself, and either
the son had to go or the family must
have lived on grass. The old man’s ob-
jection to visiting the town appeared to
be that “there was too many lawyers there;’
evidently he imagined that a lawyer might seize
him at any time, and strip him naked on the
pavement, and his only hope was to keep out of
sight. He had a vague, shadowy idea that a new
bridge had been put up five years previously on
the main road to Sydney just two miles from his
lair, but he had never been along to see it. And
he had actually no recollections of Parkes. He
thought over him a long time, and didn’t seem to
get any nearer solving the mystery. But at last a
dull sort of light appeared in his eye—the sort of
light that you see when the new moon shines on a
dead fish—and he hazarded the theory that per-
haps he had something to do with Nicholls and
Lester and the old-time murders up the Parra-
matta River. The story of the placid Australian
farmer ends here, for that great thought exhausted
him, and he deposited himself in a shady spot
under the hedge to wait for dinner. And the
writer climbed on to his horse, and came away
wondering how much one man could contrive not
to know provided he only tried hard enough.

The Australian patent rights of an Ameri-
can, invention for the expeditious washing of
dishes, which in California alone realised a
profit of 74,000 dollars, was bought by two smart
Yankees for .£4OOO, and the pair hied them o’er
the (long wash of Australasian seas certain of here
making a speedy fortune. But they had been
measuring the Australian housefather by his
American prototype. The Melican man has a
I loupe full of little “notions” designed to lessen
the. work of his women folk, whereas the Aus-
tralian ditto seemingly loves to make his female
dependants “graft” all the time, so the Yanks
have had to sell out the invention here for as many
hundreds as it cost them thousands, and have
sadly departed.

A Sydney man (which his name is Hill)
has just made <£sooo out of a patent sanitarv
appliance. He didn’t invent it, or steal it, or buy

about as large and important as Wyoming, and
who had no idea that he was giving away a tidy
fortune.

It is related that the man who persuaded
a certain Australian clergyman to fly to ’Frisco,
attended him to the steamer and" then went
straight to a daily newspaper office, and “gave
away the whole show.” A citizen who liked the
erring parson and knew the circumstances met
this genial joker aforesaid in the street a few days
later: “Excuse me, sir,” said he, with a genial

There was at one time in Sydney a noto-
rious gang of successful shop-lifters. Dicky
Driver was their standing legal adviser, and lie
was very fortunate—thanks to Dailey, whom he
always retained to defend them when “ nicked ”
in procuring their acquittal. At last they were
caught red-handed, and Dick was hard-pressed
for a good defence. Dailey was retained at a
large fee, but ere his brief was delivered he was
secured for the defence of the V—-’s, ricli
squatters, who were to be tried for cattle-stealing
up North. The fee in this case was 1000 guineas,
which was too big for even W.B.D. to decline, so
he intimated to Driver that he could not possibly
attend to the interests of his old clients. Driver
was in despair and at once went to Darlinghurst
to convey the sad intelligence to the head of tho
gang. “But it will be all right,” said Dick, “I
shall be able to get W , and ho is quite as
good.” “ W—— !” shrieked the champion thief—
“W defend me! Not much. I wouldn’t
give him bug-soup to plead for me.”
The latest London society sensation is the
publication of a pamphlet said to be by a rather
distinguished newspaper man, giving the whole
story of the supposed liaison between the Prince
of and Lady , and a certain Lord (a
friend of the Prince) and the same lady. It is all
circumstantially told, and is generally admitted to
be true. The pamphlets were all type-written,
and about fifty of them were distributed. These
have all been recovered by the lady and her
friends, except three copies, one of which is in the
possession of Lady G. C., to whom the whole
thing is, of course, “nuts.” Hundreds of people
have read, or heard the pamphlet read, as the
latest London vogue has been to give afternoon
teas at which the lady of the house read the docu-
ment for the benefit of her guests. The supposed
author invites a prosecution, but they apparently
dare not attempt it.
The comparatively recent additions to tho
residence of a Southern bishop, seem to have
succeeded in “laying’’the ghost which a former
bishop and certain visiting parsons became quite
aceustomed to see roaming about the house and
precincts. The “ghost ” was popularly supposed
to be the shade of the wife of a former judge who
occupied the old house, whose convival habits not
only brought the family to beggary, but broke his
wife’s heart. She died some years after the judge,
in obscure poverty, while a son still lives, not a
hundred yards from the home of his childhood, in
a miserable shanty, eking out an existence by
selling milk.

The late Windsor (Melbourne) murder, in

like a murder, and recalls the good old days when
Mrs. Manning (who cooked her dinner in the

to be hanged in one. A murderer who, with his
intended victim, appears suddenly like a stage-
sprite up a trap, vanishes mysteriously after
having sepulchred ids skull-battered sacrifice, and
gets two months’ start of the police, is not to be
sneezed at as a caterer for the evening press.
Murderers often forget something ; this one only
wanted a little quicklime for the hearthstone

ON THE BOUNDARY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I love that ancient boundary-fence,
That mould’ring chock and log.
When I go ride the boundary,
I let the old horse jog
And take his pleasure in and out
Where sandalwood grows dense,
And tender pines clasp hands across
The log that tops the fence.
’Tis pleasant, on the boundary-fence,
These sultry summer days ;
A mile away, outside the scrub,
The plain is all ablaze,
The sheep are panting on the camps,
The heat is so intense ;
But here the shade is cool and sweet
Along the boundary fence.
I love to loaf along the fence,
So does my collie dog,
He often finds a spotted cat
Hid in a hollow log ;
He’s very near as old as I
And ought to have more sense,
I ve hammered him so many times
Along the boundary fence.
My mother says that boundary-fence
Must surely be bewitched ;
The old man says that through that fence
The neighbours are enriched ;
It’s always down, and through the gaps
Our stock all get them hence,
It takes me half my time to watch
The doings of that fence.
But should you seek the reason
You won’t travel very far,
’Tis there a mile away among
The murmuring Belah :
The Jones' block joins on to ours,
And so, in consequence,
It’s part of Polly’s work to ride
Their side the boundary-fence.

With unconscious humour, the London
D.T. commented on the quality of the people who
journeyed to Windsor to see the royal funeral
pageant. “Soon after mid-day the trains con-
taining visitors from London began to arrive. It
was a noticeable feature of these that most of the
■carriages were of the superior class, and that large
.—indeed, very large— numbers of their tenants
were ladies clad in the richest and deepest of
mourning.” The D.T. man seems to have been
surprised to find that there wasn’t a wild rush of
weeping dockers, and unemployed in sable tatters,
to attend the glorification of Duke Clarence’s
remains. Instead of which, the sorrowing pil-
grims consisted mainly of ladies, trimmed with
black velvet at 20s. a yard. Why, certainly !
Show us a woman, “high” or “ low ’’-born, in
rich trappings, and we’ll show you ten stone, or
thereabouts, of devotion to the Throne and
hysterical snobbery.

This is the story of two women who lived
in one street and hated each other like poison.
One woman had refused to marry the other
woman’s husband in the days when they both
were young, and the other woman knew it, and
loathed her because the husband had asked her
first. The other woman knew that the first
woman knew it, and loathed her in return.
Therefore when one of the husbands went away
for a few days on business the other one’s wife
wrote an anonymous letter to his grass widow,
stating that her partner had betr-r-rayed her, and
that if she called at a certain fast and disreputable
mansion in the suburbs she would find him there.
The recipient recognised the handwriting, and
though she believed the statements she loathed
the other female worse than ever for informing
her. She took a cab and went out in the dusk of
the evening to reconnoitre the house in ques-
tion. It grew dark while she was still hover-
ing about, and presently the gate swung
open and a well-known figure came out. Then
■all tier pent-up rage burst forth, and without
saying a single word she fetched the unsuspecting
man one with her umbrella. There came a shriek
of surprise; a well-known voice cried wildly for
the police ; and the assailant fled. She had made
a mistake. It wasn’t her husband at all; it was
the husband of her informant, who was also
“away on business.” When she got home she
telegraphed to her own partner, and found that
he was all right, and then, in the gladness of her
heart, she sat down and wrote another anonymous
letter, telling the enemy that her husband would
presently come home with a large bruise on his
head, received while coming out of another
woman’s house. And now these two ladies hate
each other even worse than they did before.

The run on the Mercantile Bank of Mel-

The Thirteen Club—an association formed
with a view to knocking out a number of ancient
superstitions—recently held its annual dinner in
London. The guests walked solemnly underneath
a ladder, spilt the salt, crossed their knives and
forks, shook hands across the table, opened
umbrellas in the dining hall, and did other things
of evil omen and calculated to rouse up the powers
of misfortune. And the powers didn’t rouse
worth a straw. All the same the chances are that
the Thirteen Club is the most superstitious gang
in all London, and the members carry on like this
for the same reason that the boy in the church-
yard shakes his fiat at a bush on the off-chance
that it may be a hump-backed ghost. If one
member should chance to fall down dead at the
annual gorge it is more than probable that the
. club will get crushed to death in the doorway
while trying to escape, and none of them will ever
■ come back,

A picnic came off’ very successfully the
other day at Auckland (M.L.), barring one little
incident, which cast a temporary gloom over the
scene. There was a great social and religions
light present, and with him his little wife, aged
24. The good man was active in promoting the
festivities, and, among other things, lie got up a
race, open to “ all married women under 25.”
Being an economical person, he passed the hat
round until he collected a good prize, and then he
stood by smiling to watch his own little pansy-
blossom scoop the pool, and thus save him the
expense of now bonnets for six months at least
in fact, he had collected about enough to buy all
the pansy’s wardrobe for the ensuing half-year.
A WATERY EXCUSE.
BROKEN HILL BOY (who, prior to riding “ Buckjumper,” from which he has been thrown late-
high, had been sitting in a bucket of water to ensure a good seat) : “If I had some
more water to put on my trousers I’d git on him again.”
The race was regarded as a foregone conclusion,
but, then, women, horses and dogs are all un-
certain ; the blossom ran like a deer, but all she
could do was to make a dead heat with a hulking
female, who was not specially beautiful, and had
hair like a horse’s tail. Then the good man gob
enraged, and demanded that the hulking female
should be disqualified. Ho said she was over 25,
and she said that she wasn’t, and he said that he
wouldn’t believe her unless she produced her
certificate of birth. Thereupon, she said that she
would produce her certificate of birth if the other
lady would hand in her certificate of marriage,
and in a cold, hard voice she started to demand
that the pansy should be disqualified, because she
wasn’t a married woman at all, and somebody else
proposed to get up a handicap for ladies of doubt-
ful character and bigamists—but just here the
good man, with perspiration on his brow, suddenly
awarded her the prize, and stated in a husky voice
that the matter was too trivial to be worth dis-
cussing.

A pretty “steep” Gulf Country yarn.
Thus a correspondent :
The writer in 1889 went with others to a race-meeting
at , a telegraph station on the through line. The
races had been got up by the enterprising publican, and
the first event on the card was the Stockman’s Purse, for
all horses the property of 6 ona-jide stockmen, welter
weights. The course skirted along a low coolabah flat
and over the edge of a small sandy ridge, at the back of
which the horsemen were lost to view for a few seconds.
Nine started for the first race, and when they came into
view from behind the sandhill it was noticed that one
horse (a bald-faced chestnut) was among the others rider-
leas. The jockey had collided with a tree on the course
and was killed instantly right on the track. The crowd
merely ascertained that the man was dead, pulled the
body a few yards off the track, and proceeded with the
races. The corpse lay there all that day and part of the
next exposed to the myriads of flies, ants, &0., and the
blazing sun for over 30 hours, when two half-civihsed
blackfellows were sent by some of the man’s mates to
shovel him a few inches under the sand close to where he
fell.

having been a perfect white elephant during the
cricketing trip. In this instance, at any rate,
democratic Australia infinitely prefers the lord to
the commoner.
Is Bright’s Disease Curahle?
Physicians as a rule assert that Bright’s Disease
of the kidneys is incurable ; that while temporary
relief may be obtained, sooner or later the disease
will break out again with renewed virulence and
the victim at length succumb. Recently, when it
was stated that a high official in the United States
was afflicted with Bright’s Disease, a prominent
New York paper devoted considerable attention to
the subject, and in one of its issues published the
opinions of noted physicians in the Old World
which had been cabled to the newspaper.
It appeared to be the opinion of several medicos
that while Bright’s Disease is extremely dangerous,
it can be successfully treated. This is what
H. H. Warner and Co., proprietors of Warner’s
“ Safe ” Cure, have ever claimed, and it is some-
what gratifying to find that some doctors, at
least, do not pronounce a man’s doom and frighten
him to death as soon as it is known that he has
been attacked by Bright’s Disease. Warner’s
“Safe” Cure not only cures Bright’s Disease but
minor kidney difficulties as well ; for be it known
that Bright’s Disease is nothing more nor less
than disease of the kidneys in an advanced stage.
H. H. Warner and Co. will go a step further and
will guarantee that their medicine will cure
Bright’s Disease unless in its last stages, and when
the kidneys have not for the most part become
disintegrated and been voided with the urine.
No medicine can supply new tissues, but Warner’s
“Safe” Cure will check the waste and restore
what is left of the kidneys, to a healthy condition.
This is not a debatable question, for it has been
demonstrated that Warner’s “ Safe ” Cure has
cured thousands of cases of Bright’s Disease which
had been given up by the faculty, and best of all
the patients remain cured. Do not allow prejudice
to blind you to your best interests, but begin the
vise of this great kidney and liver remedy to-day,
if you have in your constitution any of the
symptoms that characterise this insidious foe to
human happiness and life.
Bright’s Disease is for the most part very
A insidious in its beginning. With few exceptions
the patient is unaware for the first few months or
even years that any grave kidney lesion is present.
( Do not neglect the first symptoms, viz., a nervous-
L ness or restlessness, weak and tired feelings in the
| legs, and a general sensation of exhaustion, with
Jtheadacho and loss of appetite, and general
depression of spirit-

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A truly pathetic sign of the times may be
noticed in the paddock at Flemington. Even the
leviathans of the ready-money ring give a cordial wel-
come to the modest “half jimmy” investment, whereas
three years ago they would crush the poor little punter
with the observation (floridly decorated) that they “didn’t
bet in ’arves."
• * *
The Australian custom of allowing five clear
days for a first-class cricket-match may seem desirable at
times, but it certainly reduces the chance of the game
being played out in three days.
# * *
Highborn’s victory reminds one again that
Carbine gave 3J stone to the black gelding in the Mel-
bourne Cup race of 189 X A few days before that High-
born had disappointed his party by knocking under to
Malvolio, who was receiving ten pounds. But Malvolio
turned out good enough to win the next Melbourne Cup.
What sort of horse was Carbine, and who will say that
Donald Wallace isn't justified in fixing his champion’s
Stud-fee at 200 guineas?
* # *
The Sydney proprietary clubs backed down
ignorniniously in their dispute with the bookmakers.
Why don’t they agitate for the totalisator ?
* * *
Although Bob Ramage and Hickenbotham
denied that there had been a quarrel, the former did not
have a mount on any of Wallaces horses during the
V.R.C. Autumn Meeting; and on the night before the
Newmarket a notice was in the Herald to the effect that
Bob was open to engagement.
* * *
Buyers of horseflesh who give a high price for
fillies of the Musket breed on the strength of the per-
formances of the colts almost invariably get “left.” As
a matter of fact, the best of the Musket mares have been
only moderates, and the winners are easily counted—
Necklace, Necklet, Hilda, Lady Norah, Industry, Volley,
and one or two others. Martini-Henri’s full sisters, Elfin
and Woodnymph, were rank duffers. Compare these
with the colts of that breed—Martini-Henri, Nordenfeldt,
Matchlock, Manton, Carbine, Maxim, Tirailleur, Trenton,
Strathmore, Zalinski—all amongst the best horses of
their time. The only nick where the fillies were better
than the fvals was the Musket—Locket, which produced
Necklace, the M.L. six-furlong record-holder, and Neck-
let, winner of the Maribyrnong Plate. Where the colts
are worth thousands, the fillies are not worth fifties.
Backers should paste this in their hats, and restrain a
d sire to back mares because they are sired by Norden-
feldt.
# # #
The art of race-riding, which has never been
widely cultivated in this country, seems in danger of
dying out altogether. Time was when one could name a
jockey, every here and there, who had “ followers,” and
whose mount “up” was considered worth backing for the
sake of the mm. But of all the jocks who used to win
races with their heads and hands, only Teddy Power is
left on the job, and he seldom figures in connection with
“good goods” nowadays. Hales and O’Brien stroll around
the scene of their former greatness in plain clothes, the
one looking not strong, and the other unmistakably weak.
Poor Alec Robertson is under the turf, whilst Gorry—a
veritable little nugget in his day—has faded into obscurity.
There are none to fill the places of these old favourites.
Racing has degenerated into a miserable exhibition of all-
round incapacity in the saddle, and although the boss
horses may seem to be judiciously ridden when they
have things all their own way they get precious
little assistance in the time of need, as witness
the lame finish of Strathmore when collared by Highborn.
Boys don’t ride at all, in the Archerian acceptation of the
term—they merely stick on their respective horses’ backs
and jostle round the track in a wild, wobbling mob.
Nearing “ the turn for home,” the few who carry instruc-
tions to win are apt to get hopelessly entangled with the
many who have been ordered to lose, and the “trier”
that suffers the least bad luck scores a “clever” victory
That is to say, he gets first past the post with his eyes
rolling from side to side and his brain whirling round.
He has lost his cap and his presence of mind, but has
managed to hang on to his whip. So execrable is the
horsemanship in the ordinary six-furlong flutter,
that the same race might be run six times with six
totally different results. The stewards, presumably,
are quite of this opinion, otherwise they would
call upon jockeys, trainers and owners to explain
the wholesale reversals of “form” which are killing
public interest in the short “whack ’em home”
events. The finish for the Bourke Handicap, last week,
was ludicrous to those who watched it in cold blood.
No sensible punter could pride himself on having picked
the winner out of such a swerving, sprawling struggle of
beaten horses, with flustered riders flourishing whips at
random. Four of the five first past the post had pre-
viously run unplaced in the Newmarket, whilst four of
the leading five in the Newmarket were badly left on this
occasion. The extra weight they carried (only 21bs. in
some instances) was not sufficient to account for this
turning of the tables, consequently the only honest
explanation of the puzzle as regards Wild Rose, Harbour
Light, Gladstone, and St. Blaize, is that they “got
through ” in the one scramble and were “ shut out ” of
the other. Punters at a distance will kindly accept this
intimation.

The cratty spider who has been pirating the
name and style of Tattersall Adams, and diverting sweep
funds into a private box rented by him at theO.P.O.,
was caught last Saturday in the act of posting 2000 of his
nice little printed illusions to Queensland. The
“demons,” for-convenience, charged him with having
attempted to circulate printed matter without an
imprint, and on this he is held to bail which is fixed at a
total of £BOO ! On the gentleman’s person was found £5O
worth of Victorian stamps. He has incurred penalties
amounting to over £lOOO.
* * *
In England the pavilion is, during intervals, the
sanctuary of the gentleman against that social outcast,
the professional. In county matches the gentleman
receives £25 as expenses-the pro. gets £5 as wages. The
Brahmin cannot sup or sit down with the Sudra ; yet the
conduct of gentleman W. G. Grace—that champion
exponent of British cricket and British bad manners-so
disgusted Lehmann when the team was bidding Sydney
adieu, that he told Grace straight: “Not for £lOOO per
week would I again join a team captained by you.”
* * #
A week or two ago, in a boxing match at Sam
Matthews’ hall, Sydney, West, one of the combatants,
felled the other—Simpson—with such force, that the arm
on which the battered wretch dropped, snapped near the
elbow. After all, the sole argument in support of the
prize ring is that it calls directly on a man’s brute
courage. No cur can face a foe and fair play. The same
might be said of all the severe man-and-man struggles.
Seldom does a beaten pugilist present the sorry spectacle
that Beach did after his last victory over Hanlan on the
Nepean. The exhausted conqueror, after being lifted out
of his boat, vomited, and trembled like a stricken infant,
mid for nearly half-an-hour could speak only in gasps. He
n rrowly escaped dying in his boat.
# # *
The proudest man seen in Wilcannia for years
was he who bought the finest specimen of a golden eagle
yet brought to town, and tethered him by a chain to a
stump in the back yard. His next-door neighbour was
disturbed at breakfast next morning by the bursting into
the room of his son who breathlessly told him to get his
gun at once as there was an immense eagle on the fence
after the fowls. A few minutes afterwards the most dis-
gusted man in Wilcannia [topped his head over the fence
and in sarcastic tones asked the shooter if lie didn’t feel
proud of his sportsmanship in blowing the head off a bird
chained up with a steel cable?
* * *
Grace, it would appear, expects the “colonials ”
to treat him as Hodge the umpire did in a match against
som“ English bumpkins. Chawbacon, the bowler, sent
the champion’s bails into the air, and the whole field of
clod-hoppers grunted and squealed. “Notout!” blurted
Hodge readjusting the wicket—and then (aside): “You
were clean bowled, sir, and if it happens again I’ll have to
siy Out.”

The draw between Creedon and Costello was a
result of the contest not starting till past ten o'clock —a
mistake often made by club authorities, vho waste time
in preliminary goes.
A ‘tipster” on one of the Sydney weeklies
makes mention of pretty well every likely horse during
the preparation for the principal races, and when each
race is over he comes out with an article on the “ didn’t-
I-tell-you-so ” principle, and harks back to some particular
date on which he drew attention to the winner.

J oe Choynski writes to Sydney that he offered
to fight Slavin six rounds for a £l2OO purse, but Slavin
declined. Slavin has not led the life of a saint during the
past four years, and Choynski might have a better show
in a six-round go with Slavin than a good many people
imagine.

The friends of W. R. Wilson were the cause of
jockey Cusdin getting the sack last week, the Silver King
himself being charitably disposed to think that there was
as much bad luck as bad riding to account for Strath-

more’s defeat in the Australian Cup. But the “ party ”
howled dismally over the loss of their coin, and W.R.W.
let himself be persuaded to try the effect of “ new blood ”
in the saddle. The result of the Champion was certainly
all in favour of the argument that the Cup had been
thrown away by Cusdin, who, however, may yet be taken
back into the fold. It is understood that Leslie Mac-
donald, the elegantly-gloved manager of the Wilson
stable, will use his influence to effect a reinstatement of
the discarded jock in his old position.

If asked to name the greatest game of chance
under the sun, the writer would name cricket. Sid.
Gregory, who played his perfect innings of 93 against the
Englishmen, made 2 on Saturday in a club match.

Had Zalinski carried a little less flesh for the
Champion Stakes he might never have been caught by
his crack stable companion. The half-brother to Trenton
was not more than a length in front of Highborn and
Strathmore at the last turn, but still he kept pegging
away like a good ’un, and, although palpably eased at the
finish, he passed the post a good three lengths in front of
the one-eyed gelding. Zalinski’s tremendous quarters
and big heart would stand him in good stead uphill or
through mud, but on the hard, dead level he seems to be
slightly outridden by Strathmore, a longer and more
gracefully-built colt.

As the field tore up the straight for the Free
Handicap the ill-fated Pyg. was within an ace of falling
down and causing another catastrophe. Fortunately
Morrison made a smart recovery and had his horse going
again before there was time for anyone without field-
glasses to discover why Pyg. had so suddenly lost his
place and chance of winning.
# * *
Brodribb, the ex-plunger, is back again, and
was “ doing ” Plemington last week in company with his
buxom wife. He enjoyed the negative satisfaction of
seeing that Titan, although more of a dandy than of yore,
is as complete a failure as when he (Brodribb) sold the
gelding for a couple of thousand less than cost price.

Gough had no sooner weighed in for the Aus-
tralian Cup than the V.R.C. stewards asked him to explain
Highborn’s running on the Saturday previous. After the
champion race Cusdin was taxed for an explanation of
Strathmore’s defeat in the aforesaid Cup and in each
instance the jockey pleaded “jostling” as an excuse.
Punters, take heed. It “form” is to he constantly
“ interfered ” with in long distance races, when runners
are few, it is about time that the public left off gambling
on the disorderly sprints, for which no horse is a good
thing under present reckless riding conditions, unless
there is a general conspiracy to let the favoured animal
get off in front and stop there.

London Hawk says Slavin is aground for the
want of a big friend. “If anything ever looked well on
paper, it is Slavin, who would easily beat that drunken
bullock, Sullivan, who will not and cannot ever go into
the ring fit to fight.”

Sporting writers are pertinent in decrying the
ridiculously slow time of the Victorian Champion—one
minute and a half slower than Le Grand’s year. It is
urged that the prize ought not to be given unless the
time be reasonable, but, as it is, they canter two miles.
and only gallop one. The weight-for-age race cannot
hold its ground at all against the handicap, and even
the Epsom Derby will yield the palm.

A N.Q. board of arbitration was recently dis-
cussing whether £4 or £3 10s. per week should be the
ruling wages at a certain mine. The secretary to the
mine, a giant of 6ft. 3in., suddenly blurted out—“To
(heaven) with all this (vermilion) yabber. I’ll fight all
hands, one down the t’other come on. All those who
lick me get £4 a week; those that I gruel only get £3
10s.” His after comment was “And the blanky
idiots wouldn’t take up the (adjective) gamble.”

One of the selection committee, when rallied for
not picking Sid. Gregory to play against the Englishmen,

Fitzsimmons’ victory over Peter Maher, the

The latest is that Charley Mitchell has been
matched to fight Fitzsimmons for the middle-weight
championship. We all thought Mitchell had thickened
out beyond that class. Mitchell was a fighter of the first
order. If his fast life has not demoralised him, this
should prove the fight of Fitz’s life.

Melbourne’s total score was 828—the Australian record.
W. G. Grace was at
the recent Beckett - Valen-

An identity at Foley’s old
hall used to cause more
sport to the audience than
the fight. He would start in
a back seat, cool as a cucum-

work as if in a convulsion,
and he would gradually make
his way towards the fighters,
until he was kneeling at the

Speaking of a certain
in-and-out running Austra-

two prominent Australian

traordinary statement: “My
own belief is that there is
not a man in New South
Wales who is fonder of money
and less particular how he gets
it than the two men I have
named. One of them is the
son of a transport who was
banged on the hill above
Petty’s Hotel; and although
I never knew him in the
flesh, I am prepared to
believe that the journeyman
hempstretohe r was the
gentleman of the family.”

We see his name in another
part of the same paper.]

end in somebody hitting him, and he willjget bruised.

Fitzsimmons, the boxer who beat Irish champion

Acting - Coroner Neild, Melbourne, a
semi-demi agnostic, is characteristic and con-

sternly, “My boy, if you don’t speak the truth,
you’ll—ahem ! —get into trouble.”
There was a precious row, in Melbourne
and Adelaide, about that Chloe picture, but seven
Chloes, sans clothes, are included in Schrnalz’s
painting of the Virgin Martyrs, at Josh. Lake’s
new Melbourne Exhibition. Yet the ladies flock
around unshocked, because the subject is Holy,
the poor girls being exposed at the Coliseum so
that the lions and tigers could make a handy
meal. This was Edwin Long’s trick—you can
paint what you like if you only take care to give
it a halo. A far better picture than Schmalz’s,
though, is that other nudification, the Pompeiian
sculptor choosing his model, by Pavlin, a young
artist deceased.

Chief-steward W. Boulton, of the s.s.
Arawatta, has deserted “the briny” and taken
up a responsible shore position as manager of the
Grosvenor Hotel, Sydney, an office which his
many years of stewardship eminently fits him to
fulfil. Boulton was the “ Commodore ” among
A.U.S.N Co. stewards, and can look back upon
six years of appreciated service with that com-
pany, and eight years’ antecedent service with the
Union S.S. Co.*' Travellers along the Queensland
coast will remember Boulton as chief steward of
the Barcoo and the Arawatta. The A.U.S.N. Co.
has expressed its regret at losing his services, with
a spontaneous avowal that his place will be found
very difficult to fill. The cooks and stewards’
made the occasion of his retirement an opportunity
for presenting him with a valuable souvenir,
memorialising the esteem and high regard in
which they hold him. The ceremony of present-
ing this souvenir—a chastely designed and costly
silver salver— was performed on Ist March by
Second-steward Denny, in the ladies’ saloon of the
Arawatta and in the presenceof about 30stewards
and cooks, and one stewardess, who, by the way,
made a natty little speech in harmony with the
general proceedings. Uelicitations were happily
exchanged and Boulton was so moved emotionally
that everybody had, perforce, to “ wet the other
eye. ”

The Wild-Cat Column.
Pambula has been persistently boomed ; but, to
quote Abigail, what are the facts? Three claims are
getting gold, and more than thirty-three nottiing. Pam-
bula gold is worth £4 an ounce, but it is costing a lot
more to get it. The shoots have no length, and the
striking of a harder belt of country would knock them
out of depth. Too much is made of the returns of ore
sent away for treatment, and too little of the means by
which it is picked. One company, in classifying, use a
horse-trough, in which the ore is scrubbed for specimens
by boys ; consequently, the very best is sent away. The
wrong consists in concealing from the public the methods
by which the big yields per ton are made up. Another
company is getting ore on the “gouging-the-eyes-
out” principle, and each has an abundance of easily-
worked ore from the same lode, that they are apparently
afraid to touch. The parent company have all tiieir best
gold above the 100 ft. level, and, to all appearances, pre-
cious little below'. Nearly all the others are working
themselves out of existence. The local people, with few
exceptions, have had a sad gruelling. There are many in
Sydney, and more in Melbourne, who remember the field
with regret.
# # *
The first men of a new mining-field in N.S.W.
are generally limber-cutters, starved-out selectors and
other bushmen, who take to mining under the blissful
idea that a fortune within a year is an absolute certainty.
They are the holders of the “blocks pegged out for
miles a phrase always seen in the newspapers after
every find of silver or gold. Within a few days two or
three metropolitan boomists make their way to the field.
Sometimes their capital is absorbed in their fine clothes,
and any other deficiency they make up in cheek. They
know a mine when they see it, but the value of the dis-
covery is not of so much importance as the newness of
the field. They are armed with agreements of every form
drawn with the schemer’s eye to business—his own busi-
ness. The blanks only require to be filled in and the
signature attached. They discourse on the depression in
Sydney and underrate everything but themselves. A
magnificent picture of the advantages of paid-up shares,
the cornering of the markets, and the booming of scrip
generally is drawn. Finally the owners, whose belief in
the field is seldom big enough to induce them to have
anything to do with contributing shares, place their
blocks under offer for, say, 12 months, accept £1 deposit,
agree to take no cash but hold the mine in paid-up shares.
The boomsters return to Sydney and issue the balance to
themselves paid up to, say, 19s. 9d., and escape the re-
maining threepence by no-liability registration.
* * *
There are as many ways of salting a mine as of
killing a dog. So far the Last Call plan remains a
mystery though there are those who profess to have a
shrewd idea of the manner in which the rule was run
over Hammond. He was allowed to do what he liked, to
prospect when, and where, he liked. Unfortunately,
however, he did not take aff the precautions which he will
exercise if ever called upon again. It is so easy to be
wise after such an event. Maoriland has been a wonderful
breeding-ground of sailers. The neatest was that in
which a beach sand-drift was represented to contain big
gold. Every reasonable precaution was taken and the
returns were enormous. When the purchase was made
and tenS of thousands changed hands in shares the
mystery was revealed. The examiners took everything
with them but the ore-bags, of which there were plenty on
the mine. Subsequently when the returns fell to zero
microscopical and chemical examinations of the gold from
the best lots demonstrated that it was an alloy of gold—
the silver being in artificial combination with it. The
salter, whoever he was, for like his confreres he had
“ cleared,” had ground a great number of sovereigns and
lined the bags indiscriminately with gold-dust—'-id his
pockets With the results of his inventiveness.
* # *
It was a melancholy gathering. The object was
to hear what the directors had to say concerning the
Last Call mine. We have been at much livelier funerals.
Newton, the chairman, and Hammond, whom many
people had made their mining god, are not the most
cheerful of men under any circumstances. In place of
beards, nature has planted on their perfectly bald faces
immovable seriousness, and they now looked glum. The
features of Bragg belied his name. The usually festive
Daley failed to look even pleasant. Edwards, who
plunged into the “tender shares” to the tune of £5OOO,
wore a vacant, far-away stare, as if just recovering from
a wild dream of dismal unreality. The absent local
director, Urquhart, expressed his feelings in a telegram
of the most mournful description about the prospects of
the mine. Around the room were scattered some thirty
persons whose demeanour became the occasion, and there
was a lamentable absence of persons who were all there
at the early stages of the boom. The chairman told a
tale of sorrow and regret. Reduced to a few words, it
was that they put their money in, believing that their
fortunes were made. He reminded them of their pre-
vious meeting, which was understood to be of quite a
different character, when even Hammond was gleeful at
the prospect of coming riches. He put it plainly that
the mine had been deliberately salted, and that they had
been the victims of well-planned sooundrelism ; their
only hope was that the gold used for this purpose would
be found elsewhere in the mine. Not a word was
said about the criminals and no hint given as to what
steps were to be taken to convict them. A man who
described himself as a heavy loser complimented the
directors for doing their utmost in the interests of the
shareholders under the circumstances, and another who it
is well know’ll got his shares for services rendered, asked a
great many asinine questions. His faith in the property
passeth all understanding. Because he had taken some
rich specimens from the top of the drive he refused to
believe that the bottom had fallen out of the mine. He
conveyed the idea that if the bowels of the earth were
pierced in a great many places to immeasurable depths,
something might be found. In the might only the meet-
ing agreed. IBs questions ranged from ttie value of gold
to the cost of Mr. Bragg’s trip, while Hammond listened
in a way that indicated that life would have been worth
living if lie hadn’t met the Last Call crowd. The
meeting began, continued, and ended in misery. What
is wanted now’ is a meeting of all those who sold the
shaves at £2 and got clear out. We believe that would
be a cheerful meeting and would break up in sheer
hilarity.
* * *
Do not hesitate to show any man the door who
wants you to go into a machine which he claims will con-
centrate well without classification. Perfect concentra-
tion without minute classification is as impossible as sight
without light.
*‘ # *
Luhrig’s the new German concentrator,
which is also a classifier, is, as far as can be gleaned from
eulogistic notices, very imported. Tested in the presence
0 f the inventor and, of course, under other favourable
conditions, a loss of 27 per cent, is admit ed.
* * *
Having concentrated a parcel of White Rock
ore, it is declared that the mine, by the use of this con-
centrator, can be made topay handsomely if the parcel sent
represents the average of the mine. If. The Bulletin,
observing the qualification after hearing many assurances
that it is the average, stands up tq say that the
value of the White Rock ore in hulk appears to be under
lOozs, of silver to the ton.
# * #
Be not ass enough to believe the old familiar
wheeze that the man makes the mine—it is the mine
which makes the man. The ablest manager will lose his
reputation in a had mine, while the veriest duffer will
make his in a good one.

Want of business for clients and wantof money

has subdued. What, is wanted now by many who thirsted
ln the boom is something to eat.

“The result is highly satisfactory inasmuch as
the crushing included a lot of mullock,” is an oft-
recurring newspaper mining memo. It is always rubbish
or mullock when the result is “ sick.”
* * *
“Firsts,” “seconds,” and “thirds,” as crushings
are often described in N,S.W., are unknown in Charters
Towers, Gympie, Bendigo, Ballarat, or any other legiti-
mate gold-mining centre. Ninety-nine times out of a
hundred gold is thus classified for stock-jobbing purposes.
* * *
The poverty-stricken character of half the lodes
in the countiy is concealed in other excuses, such as
“the ore is too refractory for ordinary treatment;”
“ most of the gold is contained in the pyrites;” “the
battery lost the gold because of its extreme fineness.”
The ghastly truth that the results are poor because of the
absence of gold is never told.
# * *
The great desideratum in our mining-fields is to
get ores good enough to treat, not machinery good
enough to treat them. However, a machine to extract
gold from goldless ores is a long-felt want.
Someone notes that the Times suffers from
“chronic inability to make an apology.” On the
principle, we suppose, that the Deity never
retracts.

Mr. Ryan means to sell Lake Macquarie within

indefinite character —almost as indefinite as that
other advertiser who once announced in a Sydney
paper :

And the Smith that was fined and the Smith tha

London Weekly Bulletin on the litera-
ture of the English people
Anybody taking the trouble to wonder why the nation
is in the last throes of dry-rot need not go further than to
the little newspaper seller of his nearest village. He will
find on the counter when the newspaper train arrives per-
haps a bare half dozen of such journals as Reynolds’s
News or the Weekly Dispatch (thoroughly progressive
papers). But he will find that every living soul in the
neighbourhood subscribes towards a collection of “things”
(we cannot coin a word bad enough for them) which
would disgrace the intellect of a bargee’s idiot offspring.
The Christian World, the Church Bells, the oh,
our rage stops our going further with the catalogue, but
everyone of them is a cringe, cringe, cringe to someone
in power. “Letters from Jerusalem,” By the Rev. Mr.
Snooks; “A lecture on Nazareth,” by the Rev. Mr.
Brown; “ A Chapter on our Redeemer,” by Canon
Tomkins, etc., etc., etc. Any rot we can imagine—all
with an aim and object, viz., that of cadging. Cadging
for a bishop, cadging for a new church with its necessary
endowment, cadging for well, something ,or other.
And every cadge means a “commission.” Can we
wonder at our insular ignoranc' when the British
intellect is fed upon such pabulum as we have described 1!
Why in the Western States of America every village
would have made a bonfire of such rubbish. There they
take in the “Prairie Farmer,” the “Mechanics’ Maga-
zine,” the “ Artisans’ Fade Mecum And then they send
us apples, poultry, meat, wheat, corn, oats, hay—any-
thing we like to mention. And don’t they laugh in their
sleeves w’hen they look at the list of our trashy, wishy-
washy literature that teaches of a ridiculous past and
impossible future.
Young Montague F. Levey, son of rich
old Montague Levey, of Sydney, deceased, turned
up on Ist. March, at Melbourne insolvency court,
and made a great effort to explain where his little
pile had gone to. It was a very successful effort
in its way. Young Levey’s fortune consisted of
=£4oo per annum and a deferred inheritance of
£17,000 due about 18 months hence. He also
received £3,200 in cash, out of which his trustee—
who was also his brother-in-law—stopped £l,lOO
for some old debts. Then the garish youth started
to keep racehorses, and gently “blewed” the other
=£2loo. The man who sold him the racehorses
was his particular factotum, and advised him on
things generally. They gambled together, and
the factotum won. When Levey owed him about
.£l5OO, he also helped him to sell out his interest
under his father’s will; the factotum was prac-
tically the seller, and the insolvent's sister was
the buyer, and the brother-in-law —a Potts
Point magnate, by the way—acted as the
sister’s agent. Among them, the =£4oo
per annum and the =£17,000, which was
nearly due, were brought up for =£3300 in cash.
“ Financial operations in Sydney,” remarked the
brother-in-law blandly, “ are not conducted on a
five per cent, basis,” which seems a self-evident
assertion. Then Levey’s factotum collected his
outstanding little bill, and the young man went
forth into a stone-cold world, and spent the rest
of his money, and then broke. The moral —
addressed to old Levey in his sepulchre—is that
no rich elderly Hebrew should allow his son to
come of age until he is 40.

WOMEN AND FIREARMS.
The condition of terror to which the sight of a
mouse, a cockroach, or a pistol reduces a woman
is phenomenal; yet the same frail creature can
stand the ordeal of a marriage ceremony or a
christening without the slightest embarrassment,
while the natural protector of “ the sex,” who
under ordinary circumstances looks big and talks
bigger, cannot face either of the two last mentioned
trials without feeling fifty ways at once, and
experiencing a sensation that causes him to
devoutly wish that a good healthy earthquake
would come along and swallow up all that is left
of his diminished former self. But show the
average woman a gun or a pistol, and she will
shrink away and cry “Oh, dear,” and “Oh,
don’t,” and “ Oh, for mercy sake,” and will tremble
like a leaf even though the weapon be without
lock, stock, or barrel. With a man however —
how different! He will take up the shooting-iron
with as much nonchalance as he would sample a
first-class brand of whiskey, cock it, peer into the
muzzle with a critical expression in his eye, try
the spring of the trigger, and—finish a good
jug job for the doctor or the undertaker.
There can be no doubt about it; man in number-
less ways shows Ids superiority over woman.
Seriously speaking, though, the opportunity of
women, and with it her bravery and fortitude,
comes in the hour when trouble or sickness affects
those who are dear to her. Then it is that she
becomes a ministering angel, in whose keeping the
well-being and safety of a household depends, and
no prudent housewife ever neglects to keep in
stock a bottle or two of St. Jacobs Oil ready for
use in the event of accident or disease overtaking
either herself, the breadwinner, or one of the olive
branches of the family. A great trait in woman’s
character is that she is ever ready to praise the
bridge that carries her over—hence the following
unsolicited testimonial from Mrs. Calvert, of
Darlington: “I have suffered a great deal from
rheumatics in my hands and shoulders. I have
tried a great many things for it, but have found
nothing but St. Jacobs Oil to do me any good.”

FACTS THAT ASTONISH
People can’t understand how it is done, yet ulie
patent fact remains that there is nothing im-
possible about it. This reflection is the outcome
of an announcement by the famed Waterbury
Watch Company that to their former triumphs ill
the manufacture of thoroughly reliable time-
keepers they have added still another. This time
they lead the trade in producing two entirely
new series of watches, in nick *l, sterling silver,
and rolled gold, in the following styles; Series
“K,” gentlemen’s size, short-wind, stem-set, six
jewels, compensation balance, enamelled dial
(Roman or Arabic), and all the latest improve-
ments; series “N,” ladies’ size, a beautiful highly-
finished watch, with either full or Chatelaine dial,
The astonishing thing is that these watches, at
once elegant both in design and finish, and
unequalled for accuracy, are now selling in Aus-
tralia at the following astonishingly low prices:
Series “K,” nickel case 275. fid., sterling silver
435., rolled gold (15 years’ guarantee) G3s. ; series
“N,” nickel 255., sterling silver 405., rolled gold
555. No one should think of purchasing a watch
without seeing these new wonders. There is
positively nothing in their line that can approach
them.

Hans-A Condensed Story.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In the early clays of a small mining town-
ship hidden away in a remote corner of the
sequestered wilds of dear old Maoriland there
was an abandoned shaft some 90 feet deep. One
day an enterprising individual covered it over
with saplings. Shortly afterwards a mass of tail-
ings obliterated the whole, and at this stage our
story opens.
There had arrived in the town an old German
(almost noseless), named Hans. He was a man of
gigantic build, but already past the prime of life.
Whatever accident had befallen his proboscis, it
seemed to have had its effect upon his whole
being. There is no physical injury so socially
disastrous as visible damage to the nose. If your
nose happens to have been knocked to one side,
people regard you as an ex-prize fighter. It is
useless to explain that you collided with a cricket-
ball when you were young. If you are bereft of
portion of your nose, people look at you and think
of an ourang-outang or a hangman. Hans’ face
boro traces of having, at one time, been generous
and open, but it was as if his better nature had
shrunk back upon itself until he had become as
gloomy and as sullen and as sodden and as morose
and as sour and as dispirited as it was possible to
be. His taciturn disposition found a suitable
camping-ground somewhat away from the rest
upon the summit of a knoll of tailings.
There he lived some three or four years. None
knew his history. Ho was a strange mixture of
atheist, pessimist, and socialist. He had but one
intimate friend —a youth of French extraction
with strong republican sentiments and of a gay
and restlessly festive spirit. The two were drawn
towards each other by similar political views and
were now bosom friends.
* * #
On the evening when this story begins—
and ends —they were conversing together, Hans
had dropped his taciturnity for once, and was
telling the story of his life. It was just about
sunset; the grey shadows were stealing over
the waste places of the old goldfield ; and
amid the gathering dusk the noseless German
gesticulated wildly on his pile of tailings. It was
the old tale—one girl and two suitors. First, she
had declared in favour of Hans, who was an I
atheist. However, the other fellow prayed for
divine assistance, and the result was most gratify-
ing, for the Almighty had planted a cancer in the
nose of Hans. The doctor cut it out, but thereby
spoiled the facial contour of his patient. His
rival drew inferences from the circumstances :
partly by reason of his deformity, partly through
religious scruples—the girl left Hans ; and he had
wandered to Australia.
# # #
The evening deepened. The damper was
almost done. The holy Sabbath calm was an
emblem of peace. The youth, who was lying on
the bunk, had just read from the newspaper an
article, describing how a steamer had been gutted
as she lay in the dock. “ Ha,’’said Hans, gloomily,
“dere vas dat phine shdeemer; de ghautz vas
bhorned glean oud mid er. De Almidy vas at it
vouch more.”
* * *
These were his last words. The Almighty
was at it once more. The earth trembled—a
caving noise was heard. In a moment, Hans, the
frying-pan, the chimney, the damper and the fire
had disappeared. The poor fellow essayed to
clutch the bunk, but missed, and rattled down
with the rest. The chimney had been built over
the abandoned shaft.
* * *
Two days after, Hans was buried. The
cinders had even scorched his deformed nose in
death. He was only one of millions whom Fate
remorselessly pursues through life. Yet, when-
ever I hear of an appalling catastrophe, I cannot
help thinking of Hans’ last words —and, like
Victor Hugo, I would wish to know why so many
destinies are driven pell-mell upon blazes.
POLYPE.
Years ago, when the Otago Central (M.L.)
railway was first mooted, a commission was sent
out to explore the wastes of the interior .and
report on the prospects. Vincent Pyke accom-
panied the expedition in the double capacity of
'ocal member and guide, and Pyke was resolved
that the report should be favourable at any cost.
For four days the commissioners struggled along
in buggies over rocky, boulder-strewn highways,
through long, uninviting wastes of tussocks and
dust, and at night it put up at wretched bush
pubs., kept by unkempt publicans with shock
aeads and door-mats under their chins. But at
every pub. the cranky deal table groaned under
a burden of fruit and flowers, and the mutton
was splendid, and the vegetables made the com-
mission’s mouth water. “ All these things are
grown in the neighbourhood,” Pyke would
observe blandly. “ They grow everywhere here,
though, of course, you can’t expect to see them as
you drive along the road.” The commissioners
fed luxuriously, and drafted a report that Central
Otago, though it looked somewhat desolate and
sterile as viewed from the road, was a land of
wondrous fertility and ought to have a railway at
once. But the fifth day a disaster happened. In
addition to the other fruit and the flowers and
vegetables there were sundry splendid pineapples
on the table. “Are these grown here?” asked
the fat commissioner smacking his lips ; “Acres of
them,” answered Pyke cheerfully ; “ though,
of course, they aren’t visible from the road.”
“And are the ahem tickets grown here
also,” demanded the fat commissioner. Pyke
looked at the ticket; it read: “Vincent Pyke,
Esq., fromß, Smith, fruiterer, Dunedin.” “Yes,”
he responded, with an absolutely unmoved coun-
tenance ; “in good seasons the crop of tickets in
this district is something amazing.” The commis-
sioners looked at him hard, and he looked hard at
the commissioners, and neither of them said any-
thing. But a report was promptly drawn up
which blasted the Central Otago railway, and it
remains in a blasted state to this day; and Pyke
as promptly stopped the supplies, so that all the
way back the commission lived chiefly on salt goat
and bad potatoes. Wonder whether Pyke will
have the impudence to deny the truth of this story.

THE BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading 1 Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button .and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating. —In our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

PREMIER OINTMENT is the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But, as many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may b» as well to let them know that there is such
an article as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
the prod action of the colony, com posed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
Guaranteed Free from all Poisonous
Qualities. No Artificial Colouring, as the
Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.

Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Joiephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW'S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Worfs.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the publiito
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“ (Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S

and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.

Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them moat
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.Q.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30,1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are aftlcted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,
“Respectfully yours,

The Western People’s after-howl against
tho rival editor : —
He would go a little further if he dare—he would raise
and flaunt the poisoned coils which may be seen in his
glassy leer and his hypocritical smirk, but he knows to
do' that would mean his own fall, not ours.
An aboriginal rouseabout on a back-blocks
station had a kangaroo-dog of which he was very
proud, until one day in a hunt it was beaten out
of time by the stumpy-tailed cur of one of the
boundary riders. Jacky pondered deeply on this,
an d made up his mind that the superiority of the
white man’s dog was due to the abbreviation of
its tail. He speedily chopped off his dog's narra-
tive, and as horrified canine fled for
the skyline and vanished, Jacky ejaculated, “ Too
flurry short, too flurry short me cut him.” Jacky
had made his dog too speedy.
A tale is going the rounds anent Ted
Nathan and the old coaching days. A man applied
to Nathan for a billet as a coachman on the
N.S.W. Western road. “ Got any references ? ”
“No, but I have never yet upset a coach since I first
handled a rein.” “Then you’re no (bally) good
for this (ruddy) road, for when a (carroty) coach
did (purple well) upset, you wouldn’t know how
to get the (thumping) thing right-side-up again.
Go round to Jones ; he wants a (sanguinary) soft-
tomrny swell of pious (polyglot) principles and
(doggoned) education to (roaring well) ringbark
Bathurst burrs. And you’d suit him right down
to the(gory) ground.”
At Geraldton (Q.) not long since a miser-
able, broken-down Javanese labourer crawled
wretchedly into the town from an outlying plan-
tation in search of medical assistance. He had
been taken ill with dysentery, and had been
accommodated in the hovel which was dignified
on the plantation by the name of an “hospital.”
Tor some time he was an “in-patient” at this
place —which means presumably that he was
allowed to lie down in it; and after that he
became an “ out-patient,” which is probably
another way of saying that ho was allowed to put
his head in and get his medicine. Unhappily, he
grew worse instead of better, and in a panic
he struggled off to Geraldton, where the
Government Health Officer promptly sent him
to hospital. Close behind him came an official
who took out a warrant for the arrest of this
emaciated spectre on a charge of going to the
hospital, or in other words, “deserting his hired
service.” Finding, however, that his half-dead
nigger was too sick to be captured, he withdrew
the warrant and, instead, served him with a
summons, which strange document was duly
deposited in the miserable object’s bunk. The
case came on, but defendant was too ex-
hausted to attend, so the matter was post-
poned. A few days later, when he was able to
drag himself out of bed, he was helped down to
the court-house, where, being unable to under-
stand the language, and too weak to say anything
if he had understood it, and having no one to
speak on his behalf, he was duly fined £2, with
the alternative of seven days gaol. No wonder
white labour is scarce on the Northern sugar-hells.
The only white labourers the planters will engage
are those who will submit to bo arrested every
time they let go the handle of the hoe, and that
kind of Australian is in short supply at present.

Dr. A. Wilpord Hall, Ph.D., LL.D., F.S.S.C., Ac.
Let it be distinctly understood- that tliis is no
scheme of quackery- to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kirul required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst oases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption-
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in,
eluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-

In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
The Australian Temperance World says;—“We can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily doss away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Australian Star says:—“ It is thoroughly purify-
ing. hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms.

The Brown Tent.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ I don’t know who she is, nor how she came,
true, but there she is. All I can tell you is that
one evening when we came back rather late from
our claim, we found her tent had been fixed up
since the morning, and the little woman was out-
side, cooking some savoury-smelling mess over the
lire. ”
Thus Dick Thomas, in response, to my enquiry
as to his new neighbour, while I halted by the
log-tire to light my pipe. It was a remarkable
tent, being of a dull brown colour, tanned pro-
bably with wattle-bark. There seemed to be no
other inmates—in fact, there were none—only the
woman, a delicate little creature who seemed all
too small to be alone on the diggings, fighting the
battle of life unaided. A plucky little woman she
was though, for she got folks’ washing and mend-
ing to do, and when not otherwise employed she
would tuck up her skirts and go about with a tin
dish, looking for gold. Her speech had a slightly
foreign accent, popularly supposed to be redolent
of North Britain, but Dick assured me it was
French. And Dick knew, for, in his masterful
way, ho took this waif, whom he called Ada,
under his protection, getting work for her, fetch-
ing her wood, putting her in the way to find
“patches” of gold, and making it generally under-
stood, that it anyone offered her insult, or caused
her annoyance, they would have to reckon with
Mr. Dick Thomas' six feet of muscular mas-
culinity.
This went on for some time. Ada —no one ever
heard of her other name—made few acquaintances
and talked but little. Her manner was that of
habitual melancholy. She seldom smiled and her
firmly-compressed lips and square chin told of
determination and the power of endurance.
“Dick,” said I, one day, “that is a woman
with a history.”
“ That’s likely,” assented he, “ but, whatever it
i<, nobody can screw it out of her. I have tried
to pimp her myself many times, but she is always
on her guard and I can get nothing out of her.
She won’t oven say where she comes from, though
from her speech and other little things I feel sure
she is of French origin wherever she was brought
up.”
“Don’t let her make a fool of you,” said I,
“these strange women are kittle cattle to deal
with.”
For I was anxious that Dick Thomas, whose
family I had known in Wales, should not get
entangled by this mysterious stranger, who had
plumped down so suddenly amongst us on the
Avoca. But he only pooh-poohed my friendly
counsel and continued to hover about the brown
tent more than seemed necessary or desirable.
“ Indeed then,” cried his mate, Dan Rice, “ he
is there too much and too often, and I have told
him so. Yes, indeed, but he will not heed what I
say. ” _
“Mind your own business, both of you,”
growled Dick. “ I can take erre of myself.”
But he could not, as the sequel proved. Her
bright eyes—for they wore bright, the brightest I
ever saw, I think, but they gleamed, rather than
shone—her bright eyes, I say, drew poor Dick like
a loadstone. There was no laughter in them,
sadness always, tenderness sometimes, but mirth
never.
Just at that time Simpson’s rush broke out—it
is called Maryborough now—and it was settled
that I and Dan. Rice should go over there and
spy out the land. We were lucky in getting on
claims right on “the lead,” and at once sent over
for our mates, as it would not do to leave the spot
for a day. “ Jumping ” was very much iii vogue
at Simpson’s, ami woe betide those who neglected
their ground. Well, my own mates all came over
in a body, but no Dick Thomas. When they went
to see him about shifting there was no Dick to be
found. The tent was fastened up, and his swag
had disappeared. The brown tent and its inmate
bad disappeared also. The inference was obvious.
They had gone away together.
Years passed away before I mot Dick again.
But I did meet him—at Heffernan’s, in Bendigo.
It was in the concert-room, where Thatcher and
Madame Vi belli were doing a good stroke of
business at that time. He did not see me, and I
bad an opportunity of observing him while Madame
was delighting the audience by her arch rendering
of “The Captain with the Whiskers.” He stood
near the doorway, sombre amidst the laughing
crowd ; and in the interval that followed, whilst
“refreshments” were being brought in, I made
my way to him. “ Why, Dick !’ I exclaimed,
placing my hand on his arm—“ Dick Thomas; is
it really you in the flesh ?”
He started and threw off my hand, rather
roughly. Then, recognising me—“Oh ! it’s you !”
he cried, extending his own hand, and grasping
mine heartily. “ Well, lam glad to meet you.
I am on my way Home, and— But let us get
out of this infernal uproar, and go somewhere
where we can talk quietly.”
We went up to Abbott’s, where I was staying,
and got a private room. Then ho told me his
story.
“I know what you are going to ask,” he said.
“ Yes, I did go off with Adele. We used to call
her Ada, you know, but Adele was ber true name.
She had agreed to elope with me when a chance
should occur, and Dan’s going to Simpson’s with
you was right into our hands. We went away as
far as the Ovens, and finally camped at Mitta
Mitta. And there we lived till—till she left me.”
“Left you? Then she” —-—
“Yes, left me—for ever. Poor girl! She is
dead.”
A question was on my lips, but I did not ask it.
He forestalled me,
“No,” he said, “we were never married. God
knows it was not my fault. I offered—begged
her—over and over again to marry me; but she
would not. She was a Catholic, and I was a Pro-
testant, but it was not that alone that prevented
us from being lawfully united. She had a secret
reason, poor soul! which she would not —did not
disclose until it was too late. All she answered
when I urged her, was that she would be a good
wife to me in all but the name, but she would not
marry any son of man. Queer, you say, but
recollect she had peculiar French notions, and
there was a reason of which I know now and
respect her memory for. When she was on her
deathbed she told me to look, after she was gone,
in a small box, of which she gave me the key, and
that there I should find something which would
explain all. ‘ You know, Dick,’ she said, ‘ I have
never really loved you. My love is in Heaven —
I could not love another. But I do like you,
Dick, very much. I always did like you. How
could I help it when you were so good to me, so
kind, so comforting, when I had not a living
friend ? ’ ”
Dick bent his head on his arms and literally
sobbed aloud. And I had no word of sympathy
to offer him; for I was stricken dumb in the
presence of his great grief. Presently he re-
sumed :
“ She was as much my wife as if a score of
bishops had blessed'our union. And I loved her
—ah, boy! I worshipped her. But I never
heard her laugh in all the years we were together.
When I opened her box I understood all, as she
said I would. There was the story of hep life, and
her abiding misery. She was of French parentage,
but had been brought up in England by an aunt
who was settled there. She became the wife of a
gay young fellow of good family, whose name I
must not mention. The marriage was not
approved by his friends, and they sent the young
couple out to Australia to get rid of them In
Sydney he fell in with a fast set and took to
drinking and gambling. One night over a game
of cards, in his own house, a dispute occurred,
angry words were exchanged, and he killed a man.
At least he was charged with it, and the jury
found him guilty, but Adele with her last breath
declared he was innocent—that—oh ! how can I
tell it? Here —read this—just the last para-
graph.”
He took from his pocketbook a much-stained
and blotted manuscript—blotted probably by
tears—and handed it to me, and I read as fol-
lows :
“ —had got my husband down on the sofa, and
was trying to strangle him, or I thought so. I was mad
with tenor, and I seized the pistol and fired it at him. I
did not mean to kill him, hut I did. My husband, ,
is innocent of all participation in his death. lam the
guiltv one; and this 1 swear by all my hopes of eternal
rest.”
Then followed a prayer for her husband’s pardon
and release, signed ‘ ‘ Adele . ”
It was the copy of a petition which she had pre-
sented to the Governor. She took it herself, and
on her knees besought mer - cy for her husband,
affirming her own guilt and offering to suffer in
his place.. But it was all in vain ; the poor wretch
was hanged, and Adele was placed in a lunatic
asylum, for the doctors declared she was mad, and
at the time perhaps she was.
“ Do you believe she did it?” I asked.
“ My dear fellow,” said Dick, “ the wound was
in front. How could she have shot him there, in
the position the men were ? But she repeated the
statement so often, that at last she came to believe
it. She would have sacrificed herself to save her
husband, but he would not suffer it. When he
heard that his wife had accused herself to screen
him, he was manly enough to confess that his own
hand had launched the fatal bullet. But what
will not a woman do for the man she loves?”
TAATARA.
A Gulf-country horror : One, M'Dougalh
owns a crippled daughter and a decrepit tilt-
waggon. The girl is blind and dumb, paralysed
in her arms, and has only rudimentary feet, with
which she manages to feed herself. M‘Dougall
was taking this deformed misery in the almost
equally-deformed tilt-waggon from Georgetown to
Hughenden, via Oak Park and Chndleigh Park.
The shandrydan broke down about nine miles
from Chudleigh Park. Leaving the girl in the
waggon, the father started to ride the distance.
The station is off the road, and he missed it, and
rode wearily on to Mount Sturgeon, 35 miles
further, the manager of which showed him the
way to Chudleigh. Meanwhile, the crippled girl
was left three days without food. She had rolled
herself out of the waggon in her agony. They
found her 20 yards away, covered with flies and
with myriads of ants devouring her, Ilowever,
she still lives.
Cur Republic.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Gazins; afar, we have glimpses of infinite glory ;
Dimly as yet, but suggesting a brightness untold ;
Full of a sweetness unknown, and unhinted in story—
What shall it be when the mists of the morn are
uproll'd ?
Do ! Our Republic, afar, but each day drawing nearer ;
Proud in the knowledge of strength and the glory of
might.
See ! she is looming up larger, and standing out clearer ;
Fair is her form, and her face is ineffably bright.
Bright is her glance, in the knowledge of future dominion,
Clear is her brow, and firm-set is her beautiful mouth ;
Mighty her limbs, which no vile old-world shackles shall
pinion ;
Naught shall enslave Our Republic, the Pride of the
South.
Hark ! On our anvils the plates of her harness are ringing;
Bright shall it gleam when enclasping each radiant
limb ;
Hear how the armour-smiths gaily are shouting and
singing,
Thundering joyously out the Republican hymn.
“ Freedom ” and “ Freedom ” alone shall she have for a
watchword ;
“ Freedom,” and let it ring out to the ends of the earth;
Not a mere name, not a sound sent about for a catch-
word—
Freedom for all, whatsoever their colour or birth.
Bright shall tier banner be, stainless, a mark to the
nations
(Not like their blood-sodden rags, with , their mem’rics
of war),
Tolling of hope for the countless unborn generations,
Marking a land that is Freedom’s from shore unto
shore.
Oh ! she is coming. Oh ! lovely, and fair as the morning,
Soon shall she reign “ from the centre all round to the
sea,”
Fair is the star of each province her forehead adorning—
Hail, Our Republic, Australia, United and Free.

John Wilson’s Oath: A Temperance Tale.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Preface and Apology.
I have an aunt, she is pious and tea-total; like-
wise a grand-aunt, who is piouser and teatotaller.
But these ladies have sense (of a sort), and know
that most temperance tracts are too skim-milky
for those whom they would benefit. Tiierefore
at a great mission (I believe that is the correct
word), they proposed that a more realistic author
than usual should be induced, for an honorarium,
to write something that would wind itself into the
sympathies of the ordinary young heathen tippler,
not the general swiper, but the “ wont-go-home.’
till-morning ” lot, the knocker-wrencher, the sign-
board changer, the latch-key man—in fact, the
middle-class d la Moorhouse moderate drinker.
They then named a rising old man called Mr.
Allspice Fmem—in fact, myself. The cunning
old tabbies never said I was their relation, and
they considered that they were giving me a great
chance. In the words of the (nursery) poet
Come, children, listen to my tale.
T -P-—I did not receive the honorarium (fine
word that).
Chap. I.— Analysis : The First Glass.
John Wilson was in love. A man must be in
love when he walks round the slums of Glasgow
with an energetic cousin, visiting men and women
who don’t want to be visited, giving tracts that
are never read, and by a spiteful process are now
made incombustible and therefore unavailable for
pipe-lights. But Helen Mary Henman, the
cousin, was fair to look upon and said she loved
John, which statement is easiest written with a
big L and a little “e ” with one vowel between.
One day the visit was to the “ Gorbals,” a word
which I like because it was used by me in my
youth for young sparrows. There was a fiend of a
male friend with them, a man from somewhere
about the coaly lands. He was a lecturer on what
he called Tottle Obstanins, and just brimful of
conceit. Fate led them to enter a school, and that
was the ruin of poor John Wilson. You could
never guess how school-inspecting, with a pretty girl
and an ugly prig, was the means of the commence-
ment of the crescendo scale of minions of alcohol.
So I'll tell you.
Mr. M'Micking (that was his name) was posi-
tively trying to show off before Nelly Denman •
trying, in fact, to cut out Jack Wilson, and the
mischievous minx was stringing him on. When
the specially well-trained class of boys and girls
had answered the “Chief End of Man,” the
“ Effectual Calling,” and the “ Reasons Annexed,”
the following poser was put without any warning •
“Ma chuldrin, what’s anollisis?” None of them
knew, though a small boy hazarded that it was a
whale. Then with a compassionate smile the
examins.?; told them he’d show them.
“ Hc/e’s a sentence ‘ Joan Wulson bocht
some aypuls to make his chuldrin healthy and
nappy.’”
Oh ! Mi. M'Micking, if you had only known
how neeir you came to being kicked, I fancy you’d
have let the subject, predicate, and object alone.
But the climax. “ Now what were the results :
pheesical, health; moral, happiness?” About this
/ieriod John Wilson was drinking his first gless of
u-husky in a neighbouring public-hoose!
Chap. II. — The Downfall.
Nothing that I can pen is adequate to describe
the fascination of drink. No matter whether
spuuts, wine or ale, the supply creates the demand.
Ibis is a question in political economy ably argued
by politicians, who must have put the theory into
practice. Thus it was with Johnny, long called
cheery, now beery Johnny Wilson. Instead of
the bright, active, manly youth, a leering, untidy,
lurching fellow was seen daily, any time after
lunch, knocking, as it is called, about the town,
till conscience told Nelly that it was her mission
(there you are again) to save this lost sheep. I
must tell you that Miss Denman had a snug little
fortune and more in prospectu, but it was the
woman, not the money, that was the prize. Then
this plucky girl caught the backslider one
day by the arm and took him into a ladies’
restaurant to ask him what he meant? The
answer was ambiguous, not to say irrelevant •
“ whisky and soda.” What did he mean ? Simply
that he was drunk and wanted to be drunker.
Nellie would not allow that, however, and en-
treated him with tears to promise amendment,
saying that anything she could do she would in
order to help him. “Well, then,” said Johnny,
“marry me.” At this the lady hastily left the
place, leaving Mr. Wilson to pay 2s. 3d. for straw-
berries and cream with.
Chap. lII.— A Squatter.
There is a small station in Riverina, near
enough to a railway-station for mail-purposes and
only 10 miles from the town of Curly ville. Until
last year the lessee was known round about as
Quicksilver” Wilson : not that he had discovered
a lode of cinnabar or had invented a new process
for saving gold (that’s rather good) but because lie
was always on the jump. He never waited for
the telegram from Melbourne stating: “Long
between drinks.” His command was—
“ Drinks, boss; quick, like quicksilver.” And
this was the wreck of cheery John Wilson. I
will not say he was in bad health or out of
funds; but morally and mentally ho was not
a bit like the Reverend Gilbert M'Micking.
I cannot state positively that he was often
intoxicated, because drink is so deceitful. Some
can carry it, while many lie down to it. But
everything has an end. A simple sentence in a
school-house caused the first glass of whisky in a
public-house, and a simple sentence in a letter was
the means of a resolution never to drink again in a
tavern.
Chap. IV. —A Love-Letter.
My dear John, —Reports have reached me that you are
often to be seen drinking in bush hotels, which report
also says are often very, very low. You remember what
you asked me in Ferguson and Forester’s ten years ago.
It has often been borne in upon me that it is my mission
(same old item !) to save you. Now, if you give me
your word, which I know to be unbreakable, that you
will never again drink in a licensed house, I agree to
marry you. Can Ido more?—Yours prayerfully,
Helen m. Denman.
Chap, V. —The Answer.
Dear Nell,—Why you have taken ten years to fix up
your special mission is more than I can guess. I don’t
believe you love me as I loved you, as, in fact, I still love
you. Everyone will say one of two things—either that
you have thrown yourself at me, or that I am a fortune-
hunter. I know that you are now tremendously rich, and
I know that you will not draw back from your word. I
hope we shall be a happy couple. I vouch for one-half
and will do my best towards the other moiety. Telegraph
when you arrive in Melbourne. 1 shall meet you at
Blaokrock railway station, we shall drive to Curlyville
and there our old friend, Mr. Gilbert McMicking, wilj
weld us. I make the required vow from to-day.—Yours
as ever,
v J no. Wilson.
Chap. Vl.— The Travelling Dispensary.
John Wilson is awfully rich. He had made
money on his little station, and had bought up
one or two neighbours. Other land he had leased
(being a gentleman and not an M.L.C., he despised
dummyism), and seasons had been good. Then
came his wife’s great fortune, and with it—tem-
perance. _ Never again did Wilson breast a bar
or swig in a tap-room. People know him to
be a philanthropist. Where John goes there
also goes a huge, close waggon. It is fitted
inside with bottles and gallipots and lamps
and crucibles. The poor are always welcome to a
jiask from it. When visiting 1 tiny place where
hotel accommodation is necessary, that red van is
seen in the yard. The lame, the halt, and the
blind are invited to enter, and the barman is
always engaged as a dispenser. The upper ten,
also, impelled by curiosity or reason, go into the
front half and lounge and sit and smoke in it.
One of J. W.’s theories is the soothing effect of
music. The driver is a fiddler, and the company
sing : and Mr. Wilson actually pays the landlord
sixpence for every dose that the barman or bar-
maid dispenses. Mrs. Wilson has placed no veto
on a glass of wine at home, and in Melbourne or
bydney they put up in the best private furnished
house to be got, but John likes the bush, and goes
ü b u Ut doing good an . d his red shandrydan).
Hurry up, boys, Quicksilver and his missus arc
at the floyal. The peripatetic dispensary’s just
going into the yard. Fossick about for empty
bottles. This is a stroke of luck.”
SCOTTY THE WETNKLER.
Somehow the groveller seems to be always
devoid of grammar. In a shop window in Wel-
lington (M.L.), one of the tribe has on exhibition
a portrait of Victoria, and underneath it is an
explanation, which makes things more mysterious
than they were in their unexplained state :—-
Having had the pleasure of decorating, in my line of
business, Buckingham Palace for t his lady, our Queen for
five years, and having had the honour of siltin'* on’ her
Throne Chair, I feel bound in exhibiting the same"
Attached to this is another document of later
date, evidently intended to throw some li<dit
upon the explanation : —
It has been overheard, “We cannot see any throne
chair.” We can say that three-fourths of the people don’t
have a Show to see Inside the building, let alone to sit in
the Throne Chair, because there is our Queen’s soldiers
always On guard—the Life Guards, the Grecnadeers and
the Coldstreams ; only these noted regiments are allowed
None of the Volunteers.
After that, things are about as clear as a Mahatma
buried in a mud-hole.

in this district, who has been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for
more than two years, after trying several “doctors’’ with no
benefit whatever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Treatment. In this age of unblushing quackery it is well to find

to several Botanic Societies in Australia, he soon became known by
his wonderful cures of which he has numerous tokens of grateful,

rank of Botanic Scientists ; now he is the Proprietor and Discoverer
of the famous Denmark Herbal Remedies, all of which have
secured the honest support of the people, not only of Australia
but Africa, the United States, the British Kingdom and Italy’
It is not for us to enumerate the various remedies prepared by this
really learned man, but having seen and examined letters from all
parts of the world, we are assured that he has saved a world of
suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they had
given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.— Svdnev

%ST The Best Table North of Sydney.
At Brisbane, the other day, during the
hearing of the Q. Investment cases, Chief Justice
Lllley threatened to commit for contempt ”
witness Sir Thomas M'llwraith for refusing to
answer certain questions. The replies came.
THIS WILL SETTLE THE QUESTION.
“ I don’t believe there is a ivord of truth in it.”
That’s the way certain foolish people’talk when
they hear of anything unusual, or outside the
limits of their own observation or experience.
They are of the sort who laughed at Stephenson
when he introduced the railway, and at Morse
when he said that we could communicate by means
of electricity. Yet they don’t laugh at those
things now. They make use of them daily.
Some months ago the case of Mrs. Mary Cuddy
was first published. The great public accepted
the facts, as they had every reason to do. Others,
a very few (professional men perhaps) pretended
to doubt, and sent emissaries to inquire of the
lady herself whether her allegations had not been
added to, or altered, for the sake of popular effect.
Here_ is her answer ! She repeats what she at
first said, and puts a quietus on all who called
her words in question. It will be observed that
her statement is as plain and solemn as language
eau make it.
'[copy.]
I, Mary Cuddy, of 28, Catherine Street, Rich-
mond Road, Leeds, do solemnly and sincerely
declare as follows :—
Ever since I was a girl I have suffered from ill-
ness. I always had a pain both before and after
eating, and never seemed able to gain and keep
my strength, and felt that something was pulling
me down. I had a nastv queer feeling in my
stomach. _ Sometimes food seemed to ease it, and
at other times it made me feel worse, and often I
went without food, for I was afraid to eat. Com-
monly when food was placed before me I could not
touch it, and I often fainted at the very sight of it.
After a while I became so weak I could scarcely
stand or walk. I thought it was consumption
coming on by degrees and I took all sorts of
medicines to try and get relief, but it was of no use
and I got tired of taking physic, for I had lost all
faith in it. My business was so urgent that I was
compelled to be at work, otherwise I would have
laid in bed, so weak had I become. With the
weakness and loss of appetite there were other
feelings and signs that were bad and alarmed me
greatly. Among them were these A yellowish
colour of the skin and eyes, sometimes a cold,
clammy perspiration, pains and aches in the sides,
the chest and back, headache, a kind of wind or gas
coming up into my throat and mouth that was so
sour and sickening I could scarcely bear it. Once in
a while I would have a strange fluttering and pal-
pitation that made me think my heart must be
affected. My heart would thump so that I feared
it would jump out of its place, and I have had to
walk about the room for two or three hours at a
time, for I could not sit or lie. The pain was so
severe that I have asked my husband if he could
not hear my heart thumping as I walked about.
I always slept badly at night, and frequently had
horrible dreams, and was so melancholy and
depressed in spirits that I would sit down and
cry, for I got no pleasure as time dragged wearily
by. I had so little energy or strength that it was
all I could do to summon courage for the labour
upon which the family (at least in part) depended
for support. I am a dressmaker, and it will be
easilj 7 understood how hard my life was, for I
didn’t think it would last much longer. Not long
ago (May, 1887) I made up my mind to try a
medicine that is advertised and known all over
the country. I mean Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup. I had no faith in it at first, for how can
one believe in what one knows nothing about? I
bought and tried Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup
only because of its reputation. How could so
many people, I asked myself, praise a medicine so
much if it had no virtue? I can only say that I
found what they said to be true. After beginning
with the Syrup, relief soon followed. My food
digested better and gave me strength, and by
persevering with it all my pains disappeared. I
cotdd eat my food with a relish, and everything
agreed with me. Now and again when, through
confinement and hard work pi feel a touch of my
old gomplaint I take a dose or two of Seigel’s
Syrup and the trouble goes no further. Sinee the
publication of my testimonial many persons have
called at my house and asked me if all that is pub-
lished about my ease is true, and if the Proprietor's
of ScigeVs Syrup had made additions to my state-
ment.
lold them all that every word was true and
nothing had been added by the Proprietors of the
medicine, hut I could add a good deal more, for no
words can. describe what my sufferings were
during all those long years. I never expected
being well again in this world. Seigel’s Syrup
saved my life and I desire other sufferers to know
of what did so much for me. I will gladly answer
inquiries.
And I make this solemn declaration con-
scientiously believing the same to be true, by
virtue of the provisions of the Statutory Declara-
tion Act (Will. IV., c. C2.)
(Signed) Mary Cuddy.
Declared before mo at Leeds, in the
County of York, by the said Mary
Cuddy, on Monday, the 10th day of
August, 1891,
(Signed) Alf. Cooke,
Mayor o f Leeds. .
Not a syllable further is needed except to say
that her ailment. Indigestion and dyspepsia,
burdens and saddens the lives of many other
women (and men also), who will road with new
hope the outcome of Mrs. Cuddy's case, and place
a confidence which no cavilling can shake, in the
remedy which restored to her the health and
happiness that Providence designs for us all.
An elderly, prosperous - looking man
appeared, the other day, at Sydney Water
Court, to prosecute a young girl, residing
m a Sydney suburb, for having assaulted him.
He had been to the opera, he said, and was stand-
ing at the intersection of King and Elizabeth-
streets waiting for a homeward tram, when
defendant accosted him. Assuming that she
belonged to a certain class, he repulsed her,
saying he wanted nothing to do with her,
whereupon she struck him over the mouth
with her parasol, and then addressed her-
self to a constable. While the girl was speak-
ing to the officer the complainant gave her in
charge. Mr. Richards, for the defence, soon put
an entirely different complexion on the case.
His client, a handsome, lady - like person,
entered the box, and stated she had come
out of the Garrick Theatre with her younger
sister, and was waiting for a tram, when prose-
cutor asked her to go home with him. She
informed him that he had made a mistake, and
requested him not to molest her. He persisted in
his attentions, however, saying he knew her by
her voice, and offered her money. Exasperated
at the insult, she struck him across the face and
appealed to Constable Power, and while speaking
to,him the prosecutor gave her in charge. She
had never been in a court before in her life. The
officer named said he had been on that beat over
three years, and had never previously seen the
defendant. Mr. Richards said his client lived
with her mother, and offered to call evidence as
to her character, to show the improbability of her
having wantonly assaulted anyone in the street.
Mr. Delohery, S.M., said it was unnecessary to
call evidence. The case was a very bad one. The
charge would be dismissed, and the complainan
must pay a guinea costs. The plaintiff, who had
admitted to Mr. Richards that he was married,
immediately addressed the reporter nearest to
him, and asked that no mention might be made of
the case. The scribe referred him to the editor.
Strangely enough no report whatever appeared in
any one of the evening or morning papers. By
way of contrast may be mentioned a case which
came before the same court a few days afterwards,
in which a drunken, illiterate Swede, for assault
upon a married woman in George-street, was sent
to gaol for a month. The reports appear, in this
instance, with charming unanimity.
When O’Malley Clarke (now P.M. at
Sydney) received his first appointment in the
: N.S.W. public service as Clerk of Petty Sessions
at Moulamein—ever so many years ago-he
enquired where the place was, as he had never
heard of it before. At the Survey Office a
clerk pointed it out to him, very fine and largo,
on the map. “But how am I to get there?” lie
asked. “Ah, that we don’t know,” was the
reply. Nor was he more successful when he
enquired at the Colonial Secretary’s Office. He
then went to call upon Judge Therry, to whose
interest he owed the appointment-—in the first
place to thank him, and also to find out if pos-
sible how to reach the place of exile. “It's a
most exthraordinary thing,” said the Judge,
“but I saw the name a few minyutes ago in the
Herald.” The tipstaff was called and the paper
produced, and there, sure enough, it was—-“For
Moulmein direct, the well-known fast-sailing ship
, For freight, &c., apply to Gilchrist and
Alexander.” The worst of it was that the vessel
was to sail next day. “Niver moind,” said the
Judge, “ do ye just go down and give me compli-
ments to Misther Alexander and tell him ye’re a
frind of mine, an’ no doubt he’ll kape the ship for
a day.” O’Malley went to the office and the
thing was arranged, though the people at Gil-
christ’s were astonished at finding a passenger for
such a destination. The rest of the day was
spent in packing his traps (O’Malley hadn’t much
impedimenta in those days) and in wishing friends
good-bye. One of these said to him, “But how
are you going—will you ride or drive?” “Ride
or drive!” asked O’Malley with surprise—“I’m
going in one of Green’s ships.” “ It’s you that
are green, my boy,” said the friend ; “ why, how
on earth are you going by ship?” “Oh, that’s
all right,” insisted O’Malley, “and I sail in th e
morning.” His friend laughed and showed him
a map, and the future P.M. discovered that he
had booked a passage to Moulmein in India,
whereas he was bound to Moulamein on the
Edwards River. When he got there at last, lie
found that there was no courthouse, nor indeed
any sign of a township at all, except a bark
shanty and a blacksmith’s shop. He put up at
Eirebrace’s station, and used to go in every court
day and renew a notice which he fastened to a
dead stump—“Court adjourned until next Thurs-
day.”
The following interesting application wan
received recently by the manager of a Queensland
company. As a commentary on the auditing
business it is valuable : ”
I beg to make application to you for employment as
clerk in the service of your company. I have never had
much experience in clerical work any more than audit!no
accounts for divisional boards and secretaryships foil
various public institutions. 1
In other words he was quite good enough to audit
(for “various public institutions’’) but hadn’t
learned bookkeeping.
The Hawk wonders at Caringfcon, to all
appearances an intimate friend of Royalty
“posing so tremendously as the champion of the
great unwashed” . . , and making “an on-
slaught on Lord Knutsford which for bitterness
not to say vulgarity, has rarely been surpassed.”
Quite right, from the Hawk’s own Tory stand-
point. No man can serve two masters.
Dear Bulletin, —You remark that the
Irish, Welsh and Scotch comprised two-thirds of
the British army prior to the Crimean war ; if
you had said four-fifths you would perhaps have
been nearer the mark, for the Irish alone in the
“English” army in Spain numbered 25 per cent,
of the whole. There were always two courses
open to Paddy ; join the army or go to gaol; if he
didn’t like the gaol he could join the army, and if
he didn’t like the army he could go to gaol. Did
you ever notice, by the way, that it is always the
British army that gets well licked and the English
army that scores a glorious victory ?— Geokge
