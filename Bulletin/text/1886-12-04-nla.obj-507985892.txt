“Progress Backwards.”
The pages of the Statistical Register of Ner
South Wales for 1885 furnish matter for in
teresting study, although the obvious con
elusions to be drawn therefrom are eminent]}
disappointing. The Register and the admir
able Handbook which accompanies it have
received but scant notioe from such of the
Sydney papers as are conducted in the Free
trade interest. This is not strange, for the
collated figures prove beyond dispute (1) tha
the course of settlement within the colony
is not satisfactory, and (2) that 'the in
crease of material wealth is not in proper
tion to the increase of population and debt
These facts point to some disastrous
defect in the political system of the country
and that part of the national policy which
permits the local labourer and capitalist to
be deprived of opportunity of earning am
creating wealth by forcing them into compe-
tition with slave-gangs and pauper-hordes
at the Antipodes, must certainly be debitec
with a very large share of the resulting loss.
Jt is not marvellous, then, that Freetrade
journals suppress the hostile evidence oJ
these statistics.
* *
The evidence relating to the course oi
settlement is brief but qmphatic. Sydney
and its suburbs are growing in population
out of all proportion to the remainder of the
colony ; in 1877 the number of residents in
the metropolis was 182,«25 as against 401,382
in the country, but in 1885 the numbers
were 313,652 and 644,262. Thus in 1885
32'8 per cent, of the gross population were
located in Sydney as against 28 - 3 per cent,
at the former period, an increase of 4"5 per
cent. A large addition to the number of
metropolitan factories would afford an ex-
planation of this phenomenon, but no such
increase is discoverable. The cause is
rather to be looked for in the inadequate re-
muneration attainable by industry applied
to agriculture. The value of agricultural
produce in 1885 is stated at £2,836,697,
although in 1877, when the population was
314,207 less, £2,953,952 was the value of
similar products. Thus, although the popu-
lation had increased 50 per cent., the value
of food produced from the land had ac-
tually diminished. Nor can the nature of the
season be held accountable for this decline,
for in 1885 the yield of wheat was at the
rate of 15| bushels to the acre - 2| bushels
above the average of 25 year’s and less than
one bushel per acre below the yield of 1877.
This deficiency of production necessitated
the importation of flour from Victoria to the
value of £291,999 as against £32,305 sup-
plied by that colony in 1877. In the
latter year the net import of wheat
was 1,489,996 bushels, but the corres-
ponding item in last years accounts was
2,711,876 —very nearly double the amount.
If further evidence w r ere required to prove
that agriculture is not increasing in due
ratio to the population, and that settle-
ment is proceeding on undesirable lines, such
testimony would be found in the tables showing
that since 1876 holdings other than those used
for pastoral purposes have increased in
average area from 315 to 881 acres, by con-
stant and fairly regular stages, and that the
number of holdings under 50 acres has only
"increased by 1270 during the same period,
the actual totals being 12,106 in 1876 and
13,370 in 1885. All these things go to prove
that the course of settlement is not satis
factory. The address of our “ hold yeomanry,
the country’s pride,” is in too many cases
the ‘ ‘ Government Soup Kitchen, King-
street, Sydney.” Ruined by bad laws they
come to the metropolis because there is no
room for them in the country, and are sup-
ported at the public expense. Protection
for their industry would not be more costly
than is the present mode of relief, and
besides enabling honest men to maintain
their independence, would give a freehold of
prosperity to the country, and promote
settlement on’ lines universally commended.
* * *
The proofs of the second proposition, viz.,
that the increase of material wealth of the
colony is not in proportion to the increment
of p xpulation and debt, is supported by still
more convincing, though complicated testi-
mony. The balance of trade seems to have
set decidedly against New South Wales, the
imports last year being £23,3(55,19(5, while
the exports only totalled £16,541,745 —of
which £1,371,684 was hard coin—leaving a
sum of £(5,823,451 unaccounted for by ex-
changes. Turning to the figures for 1877, it
will be found that the imports for that year
were only £1,480,775 in of exports,
but in the intervening term the tide has set
strongly against New South Wales. A »c-
-markable item of trade is that which relates
to transactions with Victoria. In 187<5 the
imports from that colony were £2,38(5,777,
and the exports £4,043,6(56, leaving a balance
of £1,656,889 in favour of the older colony ;
yet in 1885 the imports to New South Wales
amounted to £3,309,696, while the exports
had declined to £3,450,796, reducing the
balance to £141,100. A portion of this dif-
ference is explained by the fact that al-
though in 1876 New South Wales imported
Victorian flour and wheat to the value of
£3090 only, the same commodities cost
£315,432 in 1885. Just here a hoary old
Freetrade falsehood obtrudes its mendacious
head. Oracles of the Reid and Puxsfoed
persuasion claim an excess of imports as an
infallible sign of profitable trade ; they re-
gard such excess as proof that the local mer-
chants have been able to secure that sum as
clear profit to themselves and their country
on their business transactions. Mr. Henry
George in his work “ Protection or Free-
trade,” page 126, asserts that,
“ In a profitable international tiafle the value
of imports will always exceed the value of the
exports that pay for them, just as in a profitable
trading voyage the return cargo must exceed in
value the cargo carried out.”
Upon the words italicised one-half of the
matter in deputes between the upholders of
the rival fiscal faiths depends. If exports
do, under ordinary circumstances, pay for
imports,then clearly enough the more foreign
manufacturers stoke the country with their
goods the richer will it become, and Protec-
tionists are public enemies because they keep
these goods out. But a moment’s thought
proves the Free-trade assumption italicised
above to be utterly erroneous. The analogy
of a trading voyage is misleading, and tends
to confuse the point at issue. Exports and
imports are both sold for some form of
money —whether the money is afterwards
used for further buying is immaterial, there-
fore commodities outwards do not, and ob-
viously cannot in every case, pay for commo-
dities inwards. Look at it in another way.
Contain merchants or other persons who
may be represented as A and Co. remit to
foreign countries an equivalent of money,
usually in the form of bank-draft, to pay for
goods sold to them for £23,000,000 ; B and
Co. merchants and others send away goods
for which they are paid in some form
£16,000,000 ; does ‘it require argument to
prove that B and Co. do not pay for the
goods A and Co. have bought, or that A and
Co. do not receive payment for the goods
which B and Co. have sold ? These trade
transactions cannot possibly balance one
another although there is not necessarily
any los 3 , nor should there be, either to the
buyers of the imports and sellers of the ex-
ports. The banks credit their London
branches or agents with the cost of what A
and Co. pay for their purchases, and debit
the same branches or agents with the money
due and paid by foreigners to B and Co.
Doing so in this case leaves a balance of
£7,000,000 due to their London agents.
This balance, however, is further modified ;
a loan is raised by the colony, and this is
debited to London, and there are other X’e-
mittances on both sides to affect and alter
the balance. But if a bank finds that the
drafts passing through in the course of ex-
changes leave it still over the limit wilii its
London office, something must be done to
reduce the debit. Drafts on Loudon may
bo bought from other banks, and unusual
advantages may be offered to private persons
wishing 'to sell their right of drawing on
London. These two courses are daily followed.
Banks constantly sell their right to moneys
payable to them in London, and a premium
is constantly offered to all persons
who have drafts on London for sale, while
those who wish to purchase drafts—in the
common phrase to “send money home ”
are discouraged by the imposition of a
charge of ifths per cent. —that is, a man who
wants to have £lOO paid to someone in
England, must pay £lOl 12s, 6d. to induce a
bank to undertake the duty. But when all
other means of reducing a London balance
fail, the banks ship gold home to equalise
exchanges. This course involves charges
comprising freight, loss of interest, and in-
surance amounting to about 3 per cent ;
therefore, it is better for a bank to give any-
thing under that rate for drafts on England
in order to avoid the stated charges. The
shipment of coin under ordinary circum-
stances is merely a final means of making
the sum due by foreigners—whether for goods
bought by them, remittances forwarded by
letters of credit, or loans granted—equal io
the corresponding but unequal items per
contra. Acknowledging this truth, wo find
from the Statistical Register that the coin
sent from New South Wales during 1880 5
exceeded the coin received by £0,290,612,
clear proof that the balance of exchanges
was against the colony to at lea* t that ex-
tent, despite the fact that loans to the
extentof £17,000,000 were paid to our Govern-
ment during that period. This necessary,
if extended, digression from the immediate
subject demonstrates the error of the as-
sumption that imports are paid for by
exports, and raises grave fear 1 ? as to the posi-
tion of the colony. If coin lias to be so
largely shipped when the country is being
flooded with English money, the result of
the inevitable curtailment of the expenditure
of borrowed millions must be not only de-
pressing, but disastrous.
* * *
A glance at the detailed imports for the
last six years shows how helpless to supply
her own wants New Soutu Wales has become.
Such commodities as tea, opium, and rice,
which have never been locally produced,
have increased but little and in many cases
have declined ; but goods which can be and
hare been locally manufactured, show huge
increases during the period named. After
making ample allowance for the 30 per cent,
addition to population during the statedterm,
the figures show that less of the local demand
is every year supplied by the home manufac-
turer —he is being driven out of his own
market. Here are a few instances in proof :
Wearing apparel in 1880 stands at £253,000,
in 1885 £909,000 ; beer has similary ad-
vanced from £153,000 to £356,000 ; butter
from £6,000 to £99,000; candles from
£23,000 to £148,000 ; fruit from £120,000
to £245,000 ; furniture from £60,000
to £189,000; grain from £154,000 to
£347,000 ; provisions from £62,000 to
£261,000 ; and upholstery from £ll,OOO to
£91,000. These figures, coupled with the
fact that there are hundreds of unemployed
menj in every county, and thousands in the
metropolis, emphatically proves the necessity
of an immediate departure from the
calamitous policy of the past.
* * *
At the risk of becoming tedious by piling a
Pelion of warning upon an Ossa (4 lamenta-
tion we would complete this statistical
review by noticing the progress of the in-
dustries of the country. In the main,
allowing for increment of population this
“ progress ”is “ backwards.” The statistics
of woollen manufacturing excite peculiar
interest, as Mr. Pulsford has lately proved
to his own satisfaction that colonial factories
are able to compete with the world. It is
with pity for Pulsford that we observe the
figures prove that while 395,704 yards of
cloth were made in 1876, Only 187,750 yards
were produced in 1885, although mean-
time the population had increased over 50
per cent! There were nine factories in the
latter year, but of these, —ominous fact, —
three were not working. Woollen manu-
facturing and Freetrade are to one another
as a fat calf and a hungry alligator, but we
are consoled by the reflection that when the
Freetrade bladder is punched, Mr. Pulsford
will not be without remunerative occupation,
—he can go and start a woollen factory,
having already proved by eloquent articles
that this is a paying line of business. Of
other industries, fellmongering, tanning, and
wool-washing show an absolute decline since
1877, and clothing factories employ only
8 per cent more hands. The chief increases
include 3014 men employed in preparing food
more or less perishable, 4729 engaged in
building trades, and 1617 additional printers.
That 16,891 more men are stated to be en-
gaged in the tabulated industries than in
1877 will be hailed by the Freetraders with
an exultation greater than the case justifies,
for although a larger proportion than in any
former year are now employed in this way,
the fact remains that a still larger value per
head of the population, of the kind of
articles chiefly produced are now imported.
Men have been forced by the comparative
collapse of agriculture to compete for work
in the various factories, and thus it is reason-
able to suppose that the increase of hands
does not involve proportionate increased
production. And, further, the catalogue
only accounts for 40,000 men-—not more
than one-fifth of the whole array of workers.
* * *
The figures quoted may serve to indicate
that New South Wales during the past de-
cade did not progress in wealth as fast in
as in population and debt. In 1876 her
population was 614,181, her debt£H,ooo,ooo ;
the former has risen in 1885 to 957,914, the lat-
ter to £31,000,000; we look in vain for adequate
results of either increment. Agriculture is
declining, and the land is passing into the
hands of monopolists ; manufacturing indus-
try is baffled by competitors, of whom, per-
haps, the local worker has never heard.
'J he yearly increasing adverse balance of ex-
changes is draining the country of its money
wealth, and while the State is flaming with
the fire of a ruinous policy, the Freetrade
Nero.s behold it complacently the while
they fiddle away on the strings of a theory
abandoned by every civilised community in
the wide world except England and her na-
tional lackey New South Wales.
The Mount Rennie Outrage.
Nink human dingoes have been found guilty 0 f
glutting their foul appetites on one miserable
little girl. The evidence against the majority 01
them placed their complicity in the crime beyond
the region of doubt, and the verdict will be emi.
nently satisfactory to those of the general public
who have ventured to read the revolting record of
proceedings in. Court. But though the result of
the trial will receive public approbation, it is i m .
possible that some of its un-British incidents can
escape the strongest censure. Judge Windeyer
is a man of great physical powers and endurance
and was perhaps able to pass through the ordeal
of extended sittings without any visible distress
but that did not justify him in imposing the same
strain on others. We have his own statement to
the effect that some of the jurymen “ were not in
good health yet they were kept in Court until
3.30 a.m. on Saturday morning and obliged to re-
tunn within five and a half hours to listen to an ela-
borate review of the evidence, which extended over
10 hours and lasted until 8.20 p.m. Then they retired
to consider their verdict, and did not come to 'lll
agreement until 11 p.m. Thus they, wearied by
previous and prolonged sittings, were in court for
18y hours on Friday, and for I t hours oh Satur-
day ! Either day’s work would have been suffi-
cient to severely tax the mental powers of the
strongest of men, yet some of these “ were not in
good health,” and probably not any were so accus-
tomed to midnight labours as to be able to sit up
till 3.30 a.m., without feeling “seedy ” and sleepy
wrecks, utterly unfit for a severe mental strain
next day. Yet upon their decision hung the lives
of eleven men, a weight of responsibility which
of itself would be strain enough for any sentient
human being. The same considerations might
also have prevented Judge Windeyer from puti
Ling the endurance of the barristers and
solicitors in attendance to so severe a test •
for no counsel can be expected to show his best
powers for more than eight out of 21 hours.
Justice to the prisoners was not less required
than vengeance against them, and it must be ad-
mitted that, brutal as was the conduct of the
guilty in this affair, the mode of their trial was—
well what was it ? What sufficient reason there
was for so forcing on the trial, it is impossible to
discover; nor can it be explained why the final
scenes in the conviction of criminals accused of
capital offences should so often eventuate about
midnight. Johns was sentenced at the ghastly
hour of half-past two in the morning, and
in the present case proceedings did not
close till midnight. Such extended sittings,
besides militating against accuracy in the
particular instance, have a reflex influence on
public sentiment, giving rise to the erroneous inn
pression that the blood of a criminal is desired by
the prosecutors—that the Crown brooks not the
delay of its vengeance. Another startling feature
of this case is the loose way in which identifica-
tion of the alleged offenders by the unhappy girl
Hicks was obtained. In the state in which she
lay at the Hospital, with mind and vision alike
impaired and distorted by her sufferings, it is
possible that an innocent man might have been
identified by her—as was in fact, actually done in
the cases of Oscroft and Mangan. In this case
the guilt of the prisoners was determined chiefly
by independent testimony, but the girl’s evidence
as to identity was nevertheless weakened by the
manner in which the police attempted to assure
themselves of the complicity of the men arrested.
Further, it is worth noticing in this case the
microscopic amount of deference which Judge
Windeyer pays to a jury's recommendation to
mercy. His personal indifference to that recom-
mendation was sufficiently shown when, in pro-
nouncing judgment, he said
t ? w jT jou P re Pare for death. No hope of mercy can
1 extend to you. Be sure no weakness of the Executive, no
maudlin feeing of pity, will save you from the death you so
richly deserve.
Although promising to transmit this appeal by the
jury for mercy, to the Executive, he, as shown
above, did not hesitate to speak on behalf of the
Governor in Council and to exhibit his opinion
that no mercy should be shown. This disregard
of the jury’s wish will inevitably lead to
greater difficulty in securing future convic-
tions. Juries have a healthy agricultural
method of hewing out justice. The recom-
mendation to mercy was disregarded in Johns’
case, with the result that the brutal mur-
derers of Hird, the Canterbury policeman,
were, a few weeks later, found guilty of
manslaughter only. Further, we must protest
against Judge Windeyer’s argument that because
the perpetrators of former outrages had escaped
therefore the present defendants must hang. To
admit that one gang of criminals must be severely
treated because other ruffians have escaped, would
involve a sliding scale of penalties making these
latter dependent upon their failure of justice in
other cases. It is right and just that the punish-
ment of Bill Sykes should depend to some ex-
tent upon Bill’s past life, but to modify it accord-
ing to the amount of crime which Fagin
has committed is manifestly unjust. The
Law’s vengeance cannot be averaged. If
Fagin, who ought to have got 10 years, happens
to be acquitted, Sykes, who is found guilty and
deserves imprisonment for life, cannot be hanged so
as to atone for Fagin’s escape. With due respect
to Judge Windeyer, The Bulletin does not
hesitate to declare that his argument on this
point is not in accordance either with law or jus-
tice. There is one other point deserving of com-
ment. On Saturday night the prisoners passed
out of the Judge’s control; their fate then rested
with the Executive Council. But while their case
was still fsubjudice as far as the latter body was
concerned,- the dailypapers of Sydney—the Herald
is an honorable exception—did not hesitate to
endeavour to prejudice that decision by pub-
lishing bloodthirsty leaders invoking the full
penalty of the law against the men. It is
an anomalous thing that this should be per-


itted. one of these Papers had ventured
to publish such articles while the case was before
a jury who were not amenable to any influence,
tho y would certainly have been fined ; hut when
the lives of the same criminals depend upon the
decision of a Council which in at least all
other matters is strongly susceptible to popu-
lar influence, the floodgates of sentiment are
opened and a torrent of argument, invective, and
appeal pours upon the Executive. It is a disgrace
to the Australian political system that the lives of
men under capital sentences are made the shuttle-
cock of political parties, and a thing to be openly
wrangled over by hysterical newspapers and de-
signing politicians.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“For the Po’r Heathen.”
At the command of the Archbishop of Canterbury
and at the solicitation of many other grave and
reverend seigniors, the prayers of Anglicans
i hroughout the world were devoted on Sunday
last— or at least were invoked—on behalf of
foreign missions. “A girdle of prayer for the
riaw heathen encircled the world,” as one sleek
apostle eloquently remarked. We hope the
heathen will profit by this intercession, but the
hope hardly seems justifiable if its consummation
is to depend on the habits and characters of their
intercessors. This saintly archbishop, if he chose
to give up all his income beyond that required by
his bodily necessities—and if he believes in his
creed he ought to give up all his wealth—could
equip more missionaries and sustain more mission
stations than all the Anglicans together do at pre-
sent How likely he is to do this, the record of
his predecessors may witness. The history of his
Sec shows that former holders of his office
swindled the State out of its revenues at the rate
of over £4OOO a year, besides taking all of the
£l5 000 allowed them, until at length it was found
necessary by the authorities to require annual
returns of revenue instead of septennial returns as
formerly, and as the servants of God in past
years had a habit of granting long leases at a rent
of (say) £5 per year in consideration of a bonus of
(say) £lO,OOO, thus robbing their successors of
most of the value of these endowments in rev ersion
the power of granting leases at all for any term
above two years was taken from them by law. Pre
vious holders of this archdiocese have been thus
declared by Parliament to he devoid of
common honesty, and therefore unworthy of
the most ordinary confidence. Archbishop Ben-
son may be an honest man, we have no
evidence on this point, hut we do know that he
receives £16,000 a year, and aspire 3 to entertain
princes and aristocrats : the sancta simplicitas
of the Great Missioner is foreign to his ecclesias-
tical magnificence, and the “ paw heathen, who
are without knowledge or intelligence, are not
more alien in mode of life to the carpenter s son
than is this luxurious ArchhLhop. And the
bishops are like unto him. The diocese of Mel-
bourne was hawked round England before anyone
could be got to accept it at £2OOO a year and perks.
And among the clergy, although there are many
noble self-sacrificing men, there are yet as many
confessed scoundrels as in any other trade or pro-
fession except, perhaps, welshing and Politics.
And among the rank and file of the church the
fashionable church ” —the fruits of true religion
can scarcely be found. Those who are full of
good works and faith” are everywhere the excep-
tion. Does this seem a spiteful statement 2 How
is it then, that after every sermon the collection-
plate must circulate in full view of the congrega-
tion that Smith may he shamed into putting in
something because Brown is watching him 2 How
is it that the dice-box must rattle, and ceaseless
solicitations for donations be made, before a church
is built 2 And how is it that, as we showed last
week, the majority of worshippers kneel before a
mortgaged altar, and the parson preaches from a
pawned pulpit 2 Frantic appeals for subscriptions
come from the pulpit with the same regularity as
they appear in the columns of the provincial press.
And of this money 99 per cent, at least goes to
maintain the parson or the church. The poor are
neither sought, saved, nor relieved. What bles-
sings or benefit other than financial do
the bishops and clergy receive from
their Gospel 2 What advantage do the large
majority of the laity gain, save occupation fox
Sunday, a certificate of respectability, and a
place for the exhibition and inspection of new
fashions 2 But the “ paw heathen” wants none of
these things. Hunting for food prevents their
suffering from ennui, respectability thi y have
never heard of, and their fashions in dress ne\ er
alter. Who shall say that the heathen in his
ignorance is less CHRisT-like than the Arch-
bishop 2 Or that the Christianity of modern
congregations is nobler than the heathendom of
savages! True worship of the Great Original
would lift the worshipper to a place infinitely
above either class, but at present it would seem
more natural for the heathen to blame the
hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and insincerity of
modern Pharisees, than for the latter to pity the
ignorance of the “ paw heathen.” Our best hope is
that Christianity may do more for the savage
than in these ages it does for Archbishop, bishop,
parson, or layman of the Anglican or any other
church.

“ Dishing the Whigs.”
By recent speeches at Dartford and elsewhere
Lord Randolph Churchill has forced himself to
the head of his party. Where he chooses to lead,
Salisbury and Tddksleigh must follow. Present
indications portend a dishing of the Whigs such as
Disraeli was wont to delight in ; but whatever is
to be the future policy of the Tories in this direc-
tion it is certain that Lord Randolph is to be the
future leader. Some of the Tory journals stand
aghast at “ Churchill’s Radicalism,” hut they
too must follow him, or become utterly separated
from the politics of the day. The result of this
Tory bid for popular support will be to advance
fch(i party to the position formerly held by the
Liberals, who in turn will occupy the ground
hitherto taken by t he Radicals ; practically the
Liberals and Radicals will unite although mem-
bers of the two followings may retain their dis-
tinctive party names, and Socialism will obtain
complete recognition as a political force. Lord
Randolph’s advance on the path of reform may
fairly be taken as an indication that the rumblings
of revolution have already caught his acute ear ;
he, with sagacity that entitles him to political
leadership, was keen enough to perceive that
the national motive power was rapidly pass-
ing into possession of the masses; it was
clear that his party, the Aristocracy, having to
ft great extent lost their only source of
power in the alienation from them of the sympathy
of the populace, were no longer able to rule on their
old lines; the choice was, to him, between the
Devil of Radicalism and the deep sea of political
effacement. In choosing the latter he was true to
the traditions of his party. Beaconsfield,
venerated as he is by the fiercest Tories of to-day,
did precisely the same. Had he striven only to
maintain the Toryism of his predecessors, his
name would never have been recorded by fame,
and his party would have passed out of history ;
it was his skill in leading the Tories down step by
step from the dais they once occupied which
earned him lasting repute. The Liberals at the
beginning of his career were more Conservative
than the Tories at his death ; those who applauded
him in early life would have stood aghast at his
achievements in the closing years of his career.
Yet Churchill dare not now attempt to enforce
the policy, even in foreign affair.;, of this departed
chief; he dare not, for instance, call upon his
party to withstand the advance of the Muscovite
in Turkey, although in Bkaconsfield’s time even
the Liberals would have enthusiastically answered
such a call, Tempora mutantur et non mutamur
in Hits, is the Tory motto. The centre of political
force is gravitating towards the masses, and the
Tories must follow or else lose their power utterly
and for ever.

A Bishop and a Blasphemer.
A few weeks ago the Anglican Bishop of Liver-
pool, with much unnecessary snuffle, was putting
the conundrum, “ Why don’t the rural poor come
to church ? ” to all and sundry of his hearers. He
disregarded the obvious answer : ho could not
tell the wealthy portion of his flock that the Angli-
can Church has ever helped the rich and power-
ful in their oppression of the needy and helpless,
and that therefore it was that the poor hated with
a iust and righteous hate the church to whoso in-
fluence they rightly ascribed much of their
misery. The Bishop of Salisbury pursues the
subject one step further, and inquires why there
should be any poor persons at all. He asks ;
“ Why should there be this measureless contrast, this un-
equal distribution of good things ? That was a question
which they asked again and atuiin, and if no sufficient reply
w as made there would gradually he gathered up such a flood
of bittorresentment as would sweep away in a revolution not
only the signs but also the homes of religion itself.”
These are noble and reasonable words, and his
lordship’s vision of a coming revolution should
have shown him the vioiousness of the present
system. If men in their “ bitter resentment ” of
wrong are to sweep away the “ homes of religion
itself” he should he ready to acknowledge turn
religion is responsible for many of the terrible
evils now existent. The evident corollary of his
statement is that men, and clergymen especially,
are the authors of present misery. Far from
acknowledging this, he twaddled on until he fur-
nished a blasphemous answer to his own query by
saddling Gon with the whole ram of the calamity
which he deplored : there was, he said,
“ Only one answer that could be made to the question with
any approach to reason, and that was that God had made
the lots of men unequal in order that the rich might help
the poor."
The will of God ! That is the cause to which the
English clergy have attributed all the social crimes
of the present and past centuries. The will of
God has bee i declared by these oracles to
be guilty of fomenting war, of ordering
starvation to slay unnumbered millions, of
allowing bishops and archbishops to wallow in
stolen and accursed wealth, and now Salisbury
charges God Himself with having made “ the lots
of men unequal in order that the rich might help the
poor.” We and other profane persons credited the
Almighty God with more sense—we must speak
plainly—than that. He surely must have known
that the willingness of men to help their poorer
brethren decreases as their wealth increases ; He
must have known that such an arrangement as
Salisbury suggests could only lead to appalling
vice among the wealthy, and illimitable misery
among the poor. And when He found, as Salis-
bury - admits, that His plans had utterly failed—
that the “ rich did not help the poor,” it is surely
strange that He did not Himself alter the system,
instead of leaving it to men with the red hands of
revolution to sweep away the work so darkly
disfigured by botchery, and condemned by
its continual results. It is impossible to imagine
greater blasphemy than is contained in the
bishop’s dictum. The distressed poor, who, writh-
ing in the agonies of starvation, say that there is no
God or else he would not permit them sotosuffer,
are less profane than Salisbury, who says that
this measureless misery is the “Will of Gop.”
According to this latter oracle, reforms which
would lift the destitute to a position of comfort
and happiness would be contrary to the wish of a
Divine Author, who desires that suffering and sin
shall abound as under the present system “ in
order that the rich may help the poor,”—that
the lordly Bishop of Salisbury shall pocket his
£6OOO a year and perks, while Lazarus is at his
door, dying for want of a loaf. But can it he that
Salisbub y has made a verbal mistake 2 Isitpossible
that he meant to attribute this merciless cruelty
and disastrous blundering to the Chief of the
Devils instead of to the Ruler of the Kingdom of
Righteousness ? If not, then must he certainly be
branded as a brutal and blasphemous bishop.
When a priest or prelate lays the wood of his
mighty intellect on to the hall of political contro-
versy, there is generally trouble for somebody.
Cardinal Manning is the last who has essayed
this feat, and it is the question of assisted immi-
gration to Australia which he agitates. He, in a
letter to the Times, deprecates Mr. Norton’s
action in discouraging emigration to New South
Wales, and advocates “a system of assisted emi-
gration by means of lands granted or sold by the
colonial Government.” Let us reflect. The Car-
dinal can have no knowledge of the state of the
colonies at the present time : he cannot tell
whether the statements of Mr. Norton, which he
deprecates, are true or false, and certainly does
not know whether there is any land in Australia
suitable for settlement of the kind which he advo-
cates. To aid him in deciding on the question,
he has nothing but a large stock of acquired
ignorance. To parallel the Cardinal s action Mr.
Norton should write to the Times urging the
adoption of a new fashion in birettas, a new mix-
ture of incense, and an improved brew of XXX
holy water. Then matters would be about square.
Whenever a prelate mounts the platform of poli-
tics he must of necessity make an ass of himself.
He is so accustomed to spouting his little twaddle
without fear of contradiction that he at length
aspires to omniscience, and becomes too conceited
to borrow the aid of ascertained facts for the use
of what little reason he may still possess. There
have been many illustrations of this rule in New
South Wales recently : Dr. Jefferis has orated
on Socialism, Dr. Barry on the Suntan expedi-
tion, the Rev. K. D. Madgwick on Political Leap-
frog, and very many reverend gentlemen have been
known to display their inspired stupidity on the
pages of the Herald and Telegraph.
+
A y t oung Victorian has been writing to the Pall
Mall Gazette to contradict Delegate Norton’s
statement that squatters are the bane of Australia.
The young Victorian maintains that “ squatters
drive their flocks and herds into the wilderness
(evidentlya student of the Scriptures, this), where
they face the blacks, the dingoes, and the droughts.
After overcoming all these obstacles, after risking
their lives, and in many cases ruining their health,
is it a great matter, or do they deserve less than
that they should reap lasting and substantial
benefits It surprises us not to hear that this
dear young Victorian is the son of a rich squatter.
How artlessly he bewrayeth himself ? By “ lasting
benefits ” he means a life of ease and plenty for
generations of descendants of the original “ iden-
tity ” who faced blacks and destroyed dingoes.
This sucking autocrat can’t see—bless him !—that
the pioneer owes just as much to the soil as the
soil owes to him, and that at his death he and his
country are quits. No. It never occurs to him
that the bold pioneers became bold pioneers of
their own free will, or (in many cases) in mild ex-
piation of past offences—that they paid nothing
for the land and were entitled to no more (ban
they could produce from it. Lasting benefits,
forsooth ! No man can reap benefits which last—
as far as he is personally concerned—any longer
than he lasts himself. The opener-up of territory
is entitled to make his pile off the territory. He
is entitled to bequeath his pile—the work of his
own hands—to anybody else. He is furthermore
entitled to lay up treasures in heaven, for nobody
suffers thereby. But as ho didn't make Clod’s
earth he is not entitled to bequeath a few miles of
it to some kid-gM d “squatter.” This latter is
the institution against which Mr. Norton has
lifted up his voice. Nobody says that the pioneer
is the bane of Australia, save only Ihe poor black
that “obstacle’' which the pioneer “over-
comes.” The squatter possessing the soil by right
of birth, and not oven employing it to the best
advantage, is the bane of Australia. And the art-
less “ hereditary ” prattle cd’ this young Victorian
is instructive, as showing how the squattocracy is
already beginning to claim a kind of divine right
to “ lasting and substantial benefits.”
“The Vag.”
It is expected that if the “Vagabond” ever
returns to Melbourne he will recognise nobody
under the rank of a C.M.G. Hut there is a
growing suspicion among his circles that ho never
intends to return at all if ho can help it. We
should he clothed in sackcloth, and up to the ears
in an ash-bin if this wore the case, hut we will
not contemplate it. In his account of the banquet
given to the Colonial Visitors, at Glasgow, he
says:—“M. Beaugrand (Mayor of Montreal,
whpm, of course, he subsequently discovered to
bean “old friend”) made one good point when
he said that the interests of the French Canadians
were hound up with those of Great Britain ; and
if at times the Heights of Abraham and Mont-
calm came into their minds, the recollection could
be easily softened by the remembrance that
William the Conqueror came over from France to
Great Britain.” If that he the case all we have
to say is that the French Canadians are easily
satisfied. It only remains now for some repre-
sentative Irishman, charged with champagne, to
state that the memory of the Boyne is wiped
out by the recollection that that fine old Mile-
sian, Fin McCoul defeated a Saxon giant and
afterwards ate him, to make the safety of
the empire secure for ever. But to return
to Mr. Julian Thomas. There are people
who profess to discover a tinge of bitterness in his
later communications and ascribe it to his disap-
pointment at not being nominated Prince of Bul-
garia in the place of poor Alexander. This must,
of course, be the outcome of envy at Julian’s social
successes in Yurrup. He is like all other great
men in regard to having many enemies. One of
these says that his conversation, when he stretches
his legs out in the Yorick Club once more, will be
something after this fashion ;—•
YoSickclubbee : “And so you conversed with the Prince
of Wales, Mr. Thomas?”
Julian; “ Converse with him I I dined with him nearly
every day, deah boy. Couldn't bear to have me out of his
sight. 1 remember one day he said to me, 1 Julian,’ ; he
said, 1 what do you advise me to do about this invitation to
go out to Australia?' ’Wales,’ I answered, ’(we were like
brothers) don’t go till the place is aired properly. They are
very lojal there, but low—detn low. No refinement of
tone; no culchaw. I myself have had a feahful struggle to
accustom myself to the rude conditions of life out there, but
I have dissembled. The egotism of those Australians is ap-
palling. I have been so much distressed by it that, as you
may observe, I have run into the opposite extreme. But, if
you should ever determine to visit the colonies, my deah
Wales, I will be happy to giveyou as many letters of introduc-
tion as you may require, though they are hardly necessary,
for you only have to mention my name to meet with a warm
welcome anywhere between Hobson’s Bay and the Gulf of
Carpentaria. ' ”
Yokickclubbkr (;vith awe): “ And is it true that Lord
Salisbury consulted you about the New Hebrides question 5”
Julian (leaning back in his chair anil laughing softly):
“ True? My dear sir, you amuse me. Why, he sent all over
London to find me so that I should attend a Cabinet Meeting
on the subject. Remarkably discerning man, Sawlsbury 1
Told him I would undertake to clear the French out of the
islands in ten days if he would authorise me to raise a regi-
ment of volunteers in Victoria. Seemed very much im-
pressed. Shook me by the hand several times and said with
tears in his eyes 'Thomas, you have saved the Empire.
What can Ido for you ? Ask what you please—ask for a
coronet if you like —there are no dukedoms vacant just now
or you might have one with pleasure 1 ’ I told him that the
honor of his friendship was sufficient reward for me. Plain
Julian Thomas I was born and plain Julian Thomas I would
die. He seemed greatly touched, and large tears chased each
other down his cheek and fell with a heart-rending flop into
his whisky. It was a pathetic sight to see that haughty
statesman weep. 1 Excuse this weakness,’ he said at length,
brushing the tears away with his coat-sleeve, 1 this is the first
time in a long political career that I have found a man re-
fuse anything, and the shock has unmanned me!’ Nobla
fellow, Saw s jury.”
If this is to he regarded as a true sample of the
style in which Julian will talk when he comes
hack, the Yorick Club should double its entrance-
fees immediately his name appears in the passen-
ger-list. People will mortgage their houses and
pawn their clothes to become members just to
have the chance of listening to the gorgeous
creature.
Before Japan was opened to Christian
civilisation there were only 11 intoxicating drinks
known in that country. Now, over 200 such
drinks are in use, and a Japanese drunk is a com-
pound. complex, comminuted fracture of the
bones Of the moral code.
The youthful bandits hungering for fame
and riches who last week strode into the National
Bank, Albert Park, Melbourne, have up to now
only succeeded in retaining their grip of fame.
They were attired in black masks and carried
ferocious-looking firearms. The sub-manager was
at home and saw the desperadoes enter, and, sus-
pecting that their intentions were not strictly
honourable, he drew his trusty revolver and opened
the engagement. He fired and missed, one of the
robbers replied and missed. Then the banker and
the burglar continued tiring and missing until the
other youth had collected most of the loose capital,
and till half the population of the suburb
had gathered round the premises, after which the
gallant highwaymen withdrew. One was care-
fully intercepted by the crowd, but the other, a
more wily criminal, went and hid in a policeman’s
yard, where, strange to say, he was immediately
arrested with £3OO in his possession. The banker,
Gordon Dare, though he owns a three-volumc-
novel name, is apparently a worse shot with a re-
volver than a blind Chinaman. He will be pro-
moted, get a substantial rise in his screw, with
house, wood, water, and hired-girl found, like the
Simpson’s Koad hero,

justification for the use of the lash in Australia, seeing that

encourages emotional crime by piling up the sum-total of
criminal sensation; and that, to be logical, if you flog

Sydney not so very many years ago). We believe The

advise you to take any “Rough on Rats." “James Braith

that no mention is made of Lord Caringtonhaving conferred
immortality on the bard by uncovering his marble, and
speaking in his favour on that occasion. Where was Alfred
Allen’s aboriginal muse that she did not break forth in a
lofty poean beginning :
“ Good Carington ! thou cometh forth to grace this happy

consists entirely of arguments winch Freetraders have
already used ad nauseam, we do not consider it worthy of
space. You say that Protectionists and Freetraders do not
convince one another because they “ are guilty of a too free
use of facts.” That is not so. The real reason is that the
latter argue upon theory, the former from facts of every-day
life. Thus, in replying to our article you do not notice our
figures and facts, but suppose that in one country a given
amount of labour will produce 200 of animal food and 100 of
vegetable food, and that another country yields 200 of vege-
table and 100 of animal food for the same labour ; thereupon
you adduce some very satisfactory conclusions. You will
never become a Protectionist until yo i give up soaring
among the clouds of theory and come down to the level of a
matter-of-fact world. Freetrade is theoretically perfect, but
it allows cot for abrogations of natural laws by human skill,

are now-a-days in this world... .“Subscriber” : We don’t

The Graeco-Roman wrestling match be-
tween John Connors and Andre Christo!, the
recently-arrived American wrestler, came off on
Saturday last at the Alexandra Theatre, Mel-
bourne. For Ih. lltmin. the men wrestled with-
out either having the advantage, but Christol
then made the mistake of being rubbed down,
whereupon Connors, who is much the stronger,
though much less scientific a man, got
a firmer hold and thus obtained the
first fall. After a quarter of an hour’s spell the
men tacked each other again, and after 3|min.
liard work Connors secured the second fall and
the match. Miller is to meet Cannon in a Graeco-
Roman wrestling match, and after that is con-
cluded Cannon says he will think about wrestling
Connors.

Both temples of the noble art in Sydney
were well patronised on Saturday night. At
Foley’s the meeting between the elder Fuller and
Murphy was disappointing, as the latter was not
“on the job” and merely played round his
opponent. Gorman, as usual, went at it hammer
and tongs with Vine, and persuaded the latter
that he had had enough. Molloy let Burgess off
light, and “Professor” Jackson and Tom Taylor
wound up the entertainment. At Dooley and
Seymour’s the opening bout was between Mul-
holland and Nelson, the former having the call
from first to last. The usual “ talent” made up a
lively evening’s entertainment, and at the finish
the proprietors, Dooley and Seymour, gave a
scientific four rounds.

At the present moment Peter Jackson,
the Australian P. R. champion, can find no fresh
men to conquer. Tom Lees has completely dis-
appeared from the boards since his defeat by
Jackson, Farnan does not seem to have the
necessary backers to make a match, and Stewart
is not thought anxious to conclude negotiations.
Jack Dempsey, the renowned American middle-
weight, is expected in Australia shortly, but his
advent will not be of any service to Jackson, as
Dempsey limits his challenge to All Comers at
twelve stone, a weight much below the lightest
the “ Professor ” can fight.

Neil Matterson’s trouble is —well, let us be
mild and call it “ over-confidence.” No sooner
does he put foot upon Australian soil than he is
reported to have said he would soon meet Beach

the Champion. So far Matterson has not shown
that he is “ in the same street ” with Beach.

At the Sydney trotting races on Saturday
Garryowen won the Grand Distance Handicap
with great ease. The imported Yankee horse,
Huon, a really magnificent animal, was ex-
hibited ; the complicated arrangement of toe-
weights, heel-straps, leads and buckles. &c.
round his feet, would puzzle a mechanic. The
imported Yankee driver, Baldwin, did not score a
win, much to the delight of the crowd, who seemed
to resent the fuss that had been made about him
in the papers. However, he got all that could be
got out of Lillie G. in her heat.

Now that the “Bathurst burr,” young
Charlie Turner, seems about to fill the trundling
void caused by Spofforth’s marital arrangements,
we remember that he has left his mark on the un-
finished hencoops of old England before now.
Playing against Shaw’s team in 1881, Turner, then
19 years old, lowered the whole of the English-
men’s wickets in their second innings. Young
Charlie comes from good sporting stock; his
father, the present landlord of the Bathurst Royal,
having been a capital bat in his day, while his
grandfather, familiarly known as the “Duke,’
was one of the staunchest supporters of athletics
of every kind in the Western districts of N.S.W.

A Masterton (N.Z.) cockatou-farmcr, who
never attended race-meetings, never heard of
“The Derby,” and didn’t know the name of one
racehorse in the colony, about a fortnight before
the Christchurch races dreamed that a horse
called Spado Guinea had won the principal event.
Having related the singular dream to some friends
he was greatly surprised to hear there was such a
horse in existence. The old cocky was induced
after much persuasion to risk £2 to £5O on the
strength of his dream, and was still more exten-
sively surprised when he heard that Spade Guinea
—a rank outsider —had won the race, and he
himself had also won a useful little cheque.
These old fossils have all the luck every time.

More woe. A Sydney poet named Jaw

set himself on fire, and under the influence of
this mild stimulant he wrote the following, and
many other verses, about Champion Beach: —
“His promises have not been broken, though anxious
thoughts prevails
But now he’s coming back with all honors ro his home in
New South Wales.
About t >e last week in November, if the Lusitania has
favoring gales,
Lands Beach, the champion of the world, in sunny New
South Wales! ’
This poem has had a large circulation, and a
good deal of enthusiasm has been created in
asylums aud cheap boarding-houses. Ten
thousand copies went round in Victoria alone,
and the whole colony is weighed down with
drivel. Perhaps after all, the poet is worthy of
the cause. It is almost too much that this whole
glorious continent should stand on its head with
its heels sticking up in the air, and whoop, be-
cause a man has sat on a hoard and shoved it
through the water faster than another man could
shove another board.
* ‘ •
At a farewell wine-party given to Cham-
pion Beach at the London Criterion, Barney
Thompson “hoped that Beach’s immediate pre-
decessor as champion would be as good a man as
Beach.” There was a general impression that
Hanlan was somehow alluded to, but as the
Criterion doesn’t boast a dictionary, and as nobody
could spell predecessor, the question was shelved
indefinitely.

It is stated on very good authority that a
well known sporting writer on the staff of a
Sydney paper won £2,500 over the Melbourne
races. It is further stated that ho has devoted a
portion of the wealth towards building a Refuge
for decayed Reporters, with a shed at the back
for Poets. May the news he true !
* * *
Ancnt Beach’s contention that he was
“ stale ” when he rowed Gaudaur, it is only fair
to say that more than one London paper favoured
the same idea.

William Cook, ex-champion billiard player,
went “through the Court” recently. “Cook’s
Rooms ” in- Regent-street, London, used to be the
fashionable haunt of rooks and pigeons alike.
Small fortunes have been won and lost over his
tables, and " pool ” (3 and 1 in sovereigns) was a
regular institution. Now, according to Cook’s
statement, the average takings in his saloon have
dropped to £5 a week. The world is growing
wiser, apparently, and prefers to take its billiards
at private houses, where the marker doth not cor-
rupt and thieves do not stroll in promiscuously
and steal.

The Globe says that “ M'Whinnie’s horse,

The aptest-named horse in Australia is
Curiosity, who lobbed in for a steeplechase at
Sandhurst. Ho is the very sort of parti-coloured
steed which circus-proprietors specially rear and
prize. Nature evidently intended Curiosity to
career aroxxnd a ring with a lovely spangle-skirted
lady dancing a sailor’s hornpipe on his back.
Nevertheless, the horse is a good ’un and a mag-
nificent fencer. Curiosity was originally named
Duplicate—a most ridiculous cognomen. He
couldn’t be difplicated in the whole wide world.

Cricket match at River View College last
Wednesday—the local club v. St. Leonards Ist
eleven. The St. Leonards eleven generally con-
sists of two men and a pick-up ; this time there
were a man and two pick-ups. The presence of
the extra pick-up frightened the River View
players so much that they declined to play the
match. They knew the pick-ups were probably
better men than the players who, after promising
to come, threw their club and their antagonists
over.

A writer in the Melbourne Spoktsman
eloquently opposes lowering the steeplechase
jumps at Flemington on the ground that when the
fences are lowered the riders try to race over them,
and, when they get falls, invariably fetch great
grief. He omits to point out, however, any
reason to make us believe that if the fences’ were
raised or kept as they are now the ridex-s would
“take a pull” attheir leaps. Ho assorts that when
Adam Lindsay Gordon and other amateurs who
used to ride over the Ballarat course, which, as he
says, is stiffen than are the courses the races are
now run over, accidents were comparatively rare
because the men did not race at the fences. But
the old order changeth giving place to the new.
The steeplechase rider of to-day must race at his
fences whatever their height, or stand down. And
a horse galloped almost to a standstill is almost as
likely to fall over a low fence as a high one. How-
ever, no doubt something should he done, as wc
have had too many fatal accidents lately.
Abigail says he makes himself felt. So
docs a flea.
More political wheel-greasing is reported
from the Far West. Among the documents in the
present case is a wire from a member of the
N.S. W. Assembly laconically inquiring of a man
who wished to get the contract for conveying
some of the unemployed from Bourko to Menindie
—“lf I get them what will you give?” And
when the contractor replied that he would give
5 per cent, commish. the member wired again,
“Got your tender accepted. Particulars tele-
graphed, Make quick passage.” Thus the active
[ member employs each shining hour by landing his
little commish. and even the humble 5 per cent
he spurneth not.
An Indictment of Judge Windeyer.
Writes Mudgee Taylor in tho Sydney Daily
, Telegraph : — “ In sentencing the Mount Ronnie
prisoners, 1 lis Honor Mr. J usticc Windeyer referred
|to the Wyndham outrage, and enumerated it
' among a list of embezzlements from the execu-
tioner which, in his opinion, gave ruffianism a
license culminating in the present outrage. The
subsequent incidents of this case shows how dan-
gerous is tho dictum advanced by Judge Windeyer.
In the Wyndham (or Btga) case seven young men
were convicted of a concerted rape upon ah old
woman. Their conviction was the result partly
of a negligent defence arising out of overconfi-
donce in the chances of acquittal. I well remem-
ber that the press and the public, after the
conviction, commented upon the horrible character
| of the outrage and expressed a hope that the
seven men would expiate their crime on the
gallows. Much to the public discontent and
perhaps contrary to the advice of the presiding
judge, the death sentence was commuted, four
men being sentenced to 10 years’ penal servitude
and two floggirgs and ‘the other three to live
years and one flogging. As I before stated, their
conviction was the fruit of the over confidence of
their advocates, and it was partly due to the un-
compromising character of the judge’s charge to
the jury. That judge was his Honor Mr. Justice
Windeyer, who, in effect, bade the prisoners pre-
pare for death on the gallows, as it would bo folly
to expect a reprieve. Let us look at the subse-
quent history of this case. Not only did further
investigation show mitigating circumstances suffi-
cient to justify a reprieve, but also to warrant the
Executive in remitting the penalty of flogging.
As against the conclusion arrived at by Judge
Windeyer that the case was one for hanging, let
me quote the recorded opinions of .his Excellency
Lord Loftus, who caused the whole facts to be
thoroughly sifted
“ ‘ I have carefully perused all these papers, and have
come to the conclusion as follows:
“ ‘ 1. That the prosecutrix is of immoral character, un-
chaste and unreliable.
“ ' 2. That her evidence, being contradictory, is unworthy
of belief.
“ ‘ 3. That there is no other evidence but hers against
three of the prisoners, and quite insufficient evidence except
her own to prove a rape.
“ 1 4. That the whole affair bears the character of a drunken
brawl, in which the prosecutrix played the most disreputable
part.—Augustus Loftus.’
“ That was his Excellency’s opinion in the case
against the seven men who (Judge Windeyer
thinks) ought to have been hanged. And now let
me ask you and the public to note this further
development. Seven months afterwards a mass
of evidence was forthcoming which showed that
three of the convicted men were not even present
when the supposed rape was committed. They
w 7 ere released with the concurrence of Judge
Windeyer, who, if he did not think the additional
testimony exonerated them, at all events thought
it raised such grave doubts of their guilt as to war-
rant their immediate release. And yet his Honor
now, from the bench, laments that the seven men
were not hanged, although he knows that three
hawe been released! Had the Executive acted as
his Honor says they should have done, three inno-
cent men (absent from the scene of the alleged
rape) would have been judicially murdered. Ought
not his Honor to thank God every night of his life
that these men (to whom his summing up to the
jury was adverse) were spared long enough to
save him from tho remorse of sentencing innocent
men to a dishonored and undeserved grave ? ”
NECESSITY THE MOTHER OF IN-
VENTION.

Miss Houston, who figured so conspicu-

ous offers of marriage since her release from
custody. One is from a parson and another from

last we would put our money on the parson every
time to win at a canter.
Creclat Judveus is the most fitting epitaph
for the tomb of Mr. Frederick Berndt, who died
at Sydney Grand Hotel in consequence of eating
some bread doctored with rat poison. According
to the evidence, he was told that the poison was
there, but believirg apparently that the landlord
for some occult reason, had only pronounced it so
for a lark he proved his disbelief by suppim-
on the unattractive and fatal fare. s
Ihc story of Kendall’s monument is a
peculiar one. Thirteen months ago the total funds
in hand amounted to about £lO, of which Mr
Lawson had collected £22 and the Committee the
iemaindor. then Pemenyi came along and gave
a bencht concert which returned £lO5 to the fund
whuh amount the Maestro increased by a dona
Jionof £2a. Out of the whole sum subscribed'
this foreigner contributed three-fourths— and bv
this he did not even got the benefit of an adver-
tisement, for the Kendall concert was the last he
gave or intended to give-yct no mention was
made at the iccont ceremony of Remenvi’s
labours save by Dan. O’Connor, and no Sydncv
newspaper contained even a mention of the vir
Imists name. Had it not been for Remenvi’a
generosity there had been no need of Mr. Dallev's
oration, or Lord Carington’s presence at that
lonely grave.

The “ Vanishing Lady ” is the big butt-
end and climax of Dr. Lynn’s show. There is
positively no deception about this. The lady, who
carries a fair amount of avoirdupois, seats herself
in a guileless-looking high-backed chair which
stands upon a newspaper ; a thin black silk wrap
is thrown over her and tied at the back of the
chair; then a sjiectator pats her on the cheek to
show that she is still there ; the doctor unties the
wrap, shows the chair emp'y and the vanished
one. marching in from the rear of the .stage, does
a back-from-the grave bow and smiles with that
intensity of expression ever present on the face of
a woman who knows a secret. The trick is simple
enough; of the 1000 or so present on Monday
everyone saw exactly what was done, but strangely
enough they explained it in 990 different ways.

co nparalivcly eaiy, and the figure of the Count —
that mysterious, <q i ■ i-oafug, semi-omulpotent
deputy of Providence who pervades the second
half of the story—is not an easy ono to delineate.
Tho interest of tho play centres in the gloomy
prison of tho Chateau I) If, where Kd uond Dantes
—known as " No. 91 " —drags through the long
years of his early manhood, a gaunt, unkempt,
despairing spectre, whoso o ily amusement con-
sists in being occasional ; y impeded by a stony
otilcial with a hide bound c mscionco and a red-
tape soul. It is impossible, of course, to show tho

two prisoners burst through a hole in tho wall
whenever they wish to • njoy each other's society.

After this Monte Cristo swells up uud ob-

150,000 years, and did a cat like crawl along the
path of vengeance. Hut unluckily it was neces-
sary to crowd this Vingcanco hito a very small

It follows, therefore, that Mr. Dampier, as
de Monte Cristo, has to sacrifice a little
of his lofty dignity at the finish. Time is pressing
and he can’t wait to slowly pick the bones of his
enemies and gloat for months over them as they
sink down to a place where the heat makes the
mercury rise up and sit on top of the thermometer
and wipe its face with a red-hot pocket handker-
chief. Dumas’ hero started the assorted villains
gently on the road to destruction and rubbed the
downward path with a bacon rind to help them to
slide, but Mr. Dampier has to run behind and
kick them along in frantic haste, and at every
kick they jump at least 40 feet on the road to
perdition. But in spite of this the piece is a
good one, and Monte Cristo is worthy of it Miss
Lily Dampier’s Mercedes does not look much like
the fiery, passionate, Catalonian maiden who
makes so attractive a heroine of romance, and
Mr. Leston makes a much nearer approach to the
author’s idea in depicting the dirty, ragged, mean-
spirited Caderousse. We will keep our benedic-
tion for the other characters in reserve.

The Hunt Club Picnic, the Sydney Alham-

multitudes, and the applause bestowed on the
various performers is like unto the hum of a
blizzard tearing through pine scrub. Of the
feminine portion, Amy Rowe, Ida Francis, and
the sisters Pullen, get the most applause for their
efforts ; while the sterner talent, represented by
such models of beauty as Matlock, Warner, Bar-
rington, and Ryan, rouse so much enthusiasm by
their b illad singing, &c., that the audience are
only appeased by double “ ankores.” A genuine
novelty has been introduced by the corner men,
namely, some new jokes, which are nightly worked
off to much advantage.

The audience at Sydney Exhibition
Promenade Concert on Saturday night last was
very numerous and appreciative. The show is
certainly a good one, but we might suggest im-
provements in the programme. Instead of the
rather unfamiliar and “ classic ” songs and
select! ms, we would advise that at least a
few popular ballads should bo introduced
again the band only performs three times in 10
ito ns. As Hie concert is supposed to bo a
promenade one, there should be much more band
and much les.’ solo-singing. As a nutter of fact
no female voice can bo heard with satisfaction
under existing circumstances. But we mean to
color our strongest protest agamst a piece of tom-
fouDry called “A Toy Symphony,” where llio
“whole strength of the show” play on little
wooden flutes, i in trumpets, whistles, small drums,
and police rattles. In the thing itself there is no
merit, and wo are surprised that an arlist like
Kowalski can bo induced to “conduct” such a
motley band. The audience, to their credit,
showed nothing but a sense of relief and their
backs when the thing was over. Signora
Lardelli sang very pleasingly “ Maid of the Mill ”
This lady is new to Sydney, and consequently the
audience gave her every encouragement. She
posseises a sweet voice and face and will win her
way. Taken altogether the “ show ”is a remark-
ably good one.

“ Bulletin Disciple ” writes a mournful
letter this week lamenting that while our notice
of Mr. Sho. id in’s “King Lear” last week was
not entirely complimontai y, wo still occasionally
praise the business “at that cla-sic resort of the
gentle and diffident hoodlum—the Sydney
Alhambra.” B. I), apparently overlooks the fact
that, every show must be criticised according to
its pretensions. Mr. Sheridan announces a classic
performance of standard drama, and his show
is measure I according to its pretensions; it
would bo manifestly uni list to condemn the
Alhambra biz. because it is, as wo readily admit,
inferior in tragic force to Mr. Sheridan’s play,
just ns “King Lear” is deficient in humour of
that rollicking sort which delights Music-hall
audiences. To place all theatrical entertain-
ments in the same class would bo as unjust as to
condemn Pastor JcToris as a preacher because he
shows no proficiency as a song and dunce artist.
And now for a little anecdote. A few weeks ago,
three or four daily paper dramatic ciitics met in
a Sydney Theatre. “Fearful rot this show,”
languidly remarked one of them. “ The worst
that ever opened in the metropolis,” added
another. “Take ’em all lound the Sydney shows
for the last month have been the poorest lot I ever
saw” meditatively murmured the third, as they
ebbed out to “ see a man.” Yot all the Sydney

Messrs. Brough and Boucicaulfe have
lighted what somebody once called “the sacred
lamp of burlesque,” at Melbourne Opera House.
The lamp has been carefully trimmed, and is
tended by a watchful crowd of virgins. If it
doesn’t diffuse a particularly brilliant light, the
quality of the oil supplied must bo held account-
able. “Silver Guilt” is a patchy travesty of
“ Silver King.” An intimate acquaintance with
the drama enables one to got a feeble grip of the
burlesque, and faintly comprehend what it is all
about. Nevertheless, in its most lucid moments
“ Silver Guilt” seldom soars above the realms of
gloom. Mr. Robert Brough cleverly parodies
Titheradgo’s Wilfrid Denver, and Mr. Boyce
awakens memories of Phil. Day. Their perform-
ances convoy the idea that they would have been
much funnier if the author had permitted. Miss
Fanny Robina is the company’s specially-imported
burlesque lady, and dances best of all. In a word,
Miss Robina possesses that divine something
called “ go.” Another nimble now arrival is Mr.
W. Warde, a weird, wiry wonder, who revolves
in (ho air like one possessed of seven devils. He
is credited with “inventing and arranging” the
dances in this burlesque, and accordingly takes
the cake. Iwo or three eccentric dances, and the
same number of jingling melodies, are the re-
deeming features of the show. There is a little
crowd of fair girl mashers, headed by Mi«a
L revel yan, looking rather depressed in trousers
and a tall hat. And for all that they do, say, or
sing, these ladies might as well be under the cold
sod. We are forgetting to mention that “Silver
Guilt ” is “ localised ” by Mr. Geo. Lash Gordon
resident author for the company. Mr, Gordon
has not been out long enough to do any very
subtle localising, but considering that his lines are
not cast in pleasant places, he has evidently done
t best. A lot better than this burlesque is the
two-act comedy, “ Vice Versa,” which plays
merrily for the first hour or so. “ Vice Versa ”
is a stage adaptation of Mr. Anstey’s novel, deal-
ing with the complications ensuing upon a swap-
ping of souls by a city merchant and his son. A
magical stone, it Is that enables them to exchange
inner consciousnesses. Papa Brough becomes,
pro tem., a bald-headed boy with a fine taste in
toffee and alley taws, while son Boucicault, in
short jacket and Eton collar, returns to boarding-
school a rheumatical old man. Instead of kissing
the pedagogue’s pretty little daughter like he did
4 last half,” the doddering young dog only pats
her head and drivels fatherly maxims. When
there has been not too much trouble, but just
trouble enough, souls are re swopped and bliss
reigns around. The two principals score heavily
in this comedy, and the nimble Mr. Warde, afore-
mentioned, give such a life-like representation of
a sneaking worm of a school boy that we wanted
to pull his ear. As the pedagogue’s daughter,
Dulcie, Miss Boucicault is just the sweetest,
prettiest, maidenliest young fourteen-y ear-old that
ever mashed an ardent scholar at prayer-time.
All male Melbourne—from the gallery boy of
tender years to the wrinkled paterfamilias in the
circle—worships this dainty presentment of fresh
childish innocence. Even the women can find no
flaw in her. Heaven bless Miss Nina B. for teach-
ing us that angels can still live, move, and have
their being upon this sin-stained earth. “Vice
Versa” is carrying “ Silver Guilt” triumphantly
upon its shoulders, and business is good at the
Opera House.
Mr. D. Bensaude, the poor little battered

Ellen Terry’s two children recently lost
their father, Mr. E. W. Godwin, the architect.
Thereby hangs a tale. As a blushing maiden of
10 summers Ellen was married by her family to
G. E. Watts, JR. A. The marriage was unsuitable
for both parties. Even at that time—some two
and twenty years ago—Watts was a compara-
tively old man. He had a family, and the family
made things warm for young Mrs. Watts, She
retaliated, and civil war arose in the painter’s
household. Hubby attempted to assert his autho-
rity. On one occasion Ellen was expressly ordered
to take her place at the head of her liege lord’s
table, and play hostess to his friends. At the ap-
. pointed hour she did take her place, attired after
; the fashion of a Greek goddess. Watts, perceiv-
ing that his ycung filly was not to be broken in,
allowed her £3OO a year to carry on somewhere
else, toddled back to his studio, and wiped the
name of Ellen from the tablet of his mind. Then
did the lady start housekeeping with her husband’s
talented friend, Godwin. They lived a retired
rural life at a pretty village called Karpenden,
and two children were born. Watts never wor-
ried himself. Ellen drew £75 per quarter and
revelled in the cares of maternity. There was
another row. Godwin left his Ellen, and she
erected a tombstone to his memory and told the
little ones (hat “papa had gone to Heaven.” Then
a mysterious announcement appeared in the Lon-
don papers that ‘ 4 a favourite actress would
shortly return to the stage.” The favourite
actress was Ellen Terry, and she returned under
Mrs. John Wood’s management. Later, when his
wife was 27, old Watts was induced to give her
her liberty. She married Charles Kelly, found
him 44 horribly jealous,” and heard of his death
with Christian resignation. But, touching Mr.
Godwin. Of late years he was famous as the
originator of the open-air plays conducted by
giddy Lady Archibald Campbell. Perhaps, had
time permitted, the name of Godwin might have
been added to the long list of co-respondents—but
no matter. And, oddest thing of all, Godwin was
a designer of costumes for Irving’s theatre, where
the estranged mother of his children would quietly
accept his hints about the hang of a classic robe.
Their old friendship was never renewed. The
children born of this union between these erratic
geniuses regarded—or did fora time regard—their
father as a dead 'un. Now that he is dead have
they buried him, wo wonder, beneath the tomb-
stone Ellen Terry fixed up years ago ?

1 ’ght The opening of the new Opera House in
Wellington, the capital city of N.Z„ by Messrs.
M Mahon and Leitch, on November 17, was a
brilliant success. The audience numbered nearly
2000, including the Governor and suite. For
beauty of internal design and completeness of
detail, the new theatre has no equal in the
Southern Hemisphere. The city of mighty winds
and iubilant earthquakes has for once given a lead
to other Australasian cities. The “Silver King”
was the initial performance, and an elegant
oration by Mr Leitch before the curtain rose in-
troduced the theatre to its patrons pleasantly.
A Draconian Sentence.
Tub Bulletin maintains that the sentence of
fourteen years’ penal servitude and two floggings
passed upon Sweetman, the Sydney cabman, is so
ludicrously severe as to be utterly subversive
of the interests of justice. The Bulletin
further holds the opinion that Judge Windeyer’s
comments on the case as reported in the Daily
papers, and his statement of the reasons for im-
posing so extreme a penalty, sufficiently prove
that however conscientious His Honor may bo,
he labors under mental defects which render it
inexpedient that he should any longer be allowed
to sit on a criminal bench of justice. It is
especially repulsive to any human being to
contemplate the infliction of the punishment
of the lash on a long-sentenced man; the
framer of the code under which a fourteen
years’ prisoner may be sent to the triangles,
could, we hold, logically advance no suffi-
cient reason against sentencing men already
condemned to death to be tortured before execu-
tion. A long sentence inflicted upon a man who
has passed middle-age amounts to a living death.
Sweetman is set down in the records as 10 years
old ; as, according to the judge, he is a weak
man, his present term of imprisonment com-
pletely swallows up his actuarial expectancy of
life. Having, therefore, practically put him out
of the world for ever, why should society torture
him ? Is not the essence of the modern dogger’s
creed: “Flog him and let him go!” Secondly,
the only evidence against Sweetman was that of
the prosecutrix, whose main contention seems
quite incredible ; she states that the prisoner,
having enticed her into his cab—if “ enticed ” into
the cab she must be taken to have, at least in the
first instance, gone willingly—drove her away
against her wish to a lonely spot, whereas the fact
remains that the road traversed by the prisoner’s
vehicle runs through a thickly-populated locality,
and that, had the girl chosen to scream, almost at
any time during her journey she could at once
have attracted a crowd, and had the vehicle
stopped. The prosecutrix says prisoner attempted
an assault, but we have only her own word for it
and as she is a girl who, by her own admission
in the box, was not previously of absolutely un-
sullied virtue, what she swears must, in
any case, be accepted with caution, and
must in no case be regarded as sufficient
warrant for imprisoning a man for four-
teen years, to say nothing of flaying
him alive. Again, so far from prisoner having, as
insinuated by the judge, been in league with the
Mount Rennie convicts, the balance of what little
evidence there is on that point tends alto-
gether in a contrary direction. Finally, there is
nothing in the evidence as reported to warrant
the conclusion that the story of this cabman, how-
ever immoral he may be, is not substantially true;
there is in fact nothing to show that his crime was
not one which, when committed in secret, is alto-
gether ouiHde the purview of the legal code.
The Bulletin points out these things inasmuch
as Sweetman was at his trial devoid of legal as-
sistance, and because, in the present excited state
of public feeling there is much danger of venge-
ance taking the place of justice.
Chivalry and Law.
In New South Wales, when a prisoner on
his life is moneyless, the Crown fees counsel for
him to the extent of live guineas, but as it is not
etiquette for a barrister to claim the fee under the
circumstances, the solid fact remains that a pauper
prisoner arraigned on a capital charge in the
“ Mother Colony of the Australias” is—unless ho
be a blackfellow—absolutely dependent upon the
charity of the members of the Bar. Some few
people may be aware that in the Mount Rennie
cases Just past, counsel was assigned to certain
prisoners, but it is not generally known that
several of the barristers who undertook the de-
fence worked from Monday morning until Satur-
day night without fee orreward save the conscious-
ness of having done their best for the accused men.
It is an honour to belong to a profession whose
junior members are capable of such self-sacrifice ;
but why, wo ask, should not the leading barrister
(who, according to the tradition of his profession,
is not supposed to take fees) follow the noble ex-
ample set him by his brother the surgeon ? When
a pauper prisoner is tried for his life in New
South Wales his case is put into the hands of the
youngest—and inferentially the least capable, be-
cause least experienced—of the counsel at the bar;
but when at the hospital a capital operation is to
be performed upon a patient who is not possessed of
a solitary copper, the knife is wielded, not by suck-
ing surgeons but by practitioners knownjto fame,
whose time, if given to the public at their own
homes, is worth at the rate of thousands a year.
It is a miserable spectacle to see a bad or injudi-
cious defence made for a prisoner, bo he guilty or
innocent, on trial for his life ; and The Bulletin,
when it perceives that the fat well-fee’d counsel
of the senior bar calmly shake their money-bags
and go on with civil work, leaving beardless
youths to try their ’prentice-hands on the cases of
men for whom the hand of the hangman is outj
stretched —when The Bulletin sees these things
it thinks of the honorary hospital-doctor and says
that all the chivalry has fled from law.

Summer has come. The season of Sun-
burn and Typhoid is upon us, and metropolitan
milk once more assumes an aggressive attitude.
Again dees the scientific analyst peer into its
pallid depths, and see the insidious fever-germ
disport itself with its brother the fluke and the
hideous embryo cancer. Relays of intelligent and
zealous constables are told off to keep an eye on
kine of a doubtful character, and the energetic
health-officer pursues the milk-cart with the per-
sistence of a sleuth-hound. Still it comes at
early morn, this hypocritical beverage, fresh and
frothing from the suburban dairy, where the
mysterious milkman, abreast of the latest know-
ledge, with weird art turns the produce of an
aged and stricken cow to fill the requirements of
a hundred families, and look as good as genuine.
The suburban dairy, with its air of gloom, silent
and unkempt—what common mortal ever entered
in, and returned to divulge its secrets, and dispel
the superstition which enshrouds it ? Who has
fathomed the resources of that lonely sexagenarian
cow, with one born grown into its eye, and its
tail lopped off —that lank and leprous cow,
which moons about all times, wan and weary,
giving the business a tinge of truth and reason,
and living on old clothes, mutton bones, and
scraps of discarded leathern trunks? Echo was
not back with .an answ T er up to the time of going
to press. By patient investigation the enterprising
dairyman has discovered that the common snail
will give to hand-made milk the froth and bead
of Nature’s best brands, and the imprudent house-
father is often-tiraes startled and grieved to find
the yasteropod floating placidly upon the bosom
of his matutinal Mocha. It consoles him not to
know that the newest entomological research
teaches that a properly-nurtured slug contains
more blood and bone-making material to the
square inch than prime beef and porter. We
imbibe no milk. Small-pox, doctors, and other
trials and troubles may despair of sneaking into
the bosom of [our happy family through the
medium of fresh milk, and we stand to-day at a
green old age, a living guarantee of the compara-
tive reliability and salubrity of kerosene as a
steady drink.

We are informed that a company is about
to be formed in Queensland with the object of
buying up the bodies of defunct Justices of the
Peace in order to distil rum out of them. It is
calculated that the average J.P. should yield from
8 to 10 gallons to the hundredweight. Up North
the yield will probably be more. The Queensland
magistrate will now be able to rejoice over the
reflection that his life has not been lived all in vain
and die in the consciousness that he has left his
family something in the way of property, if it be
only his corpse. This company will largely in-
crease his market value. As he had very little, if
any, before, it will not be difficult to do this.

London Figaro has published a portrait
and a biography of the stupendous Goe, who will
•soon arrive to whoop up the priestly bullock-team
in Melbourne. Bishop Coe, according to
Figaro's art ist, is a stolid-looking person, whose
hair seems to have been seized in satisfaction of a
mortgage. He has no moustache, but w ears a
door-mat round the rim of his face. From his
biography we learn that he objects to “ the East-
ward Position,” from which we presume that the
western side of his face is the most expressive-
looking, and he likes to keep it turned to the con-
gregation. He is also a modcra*e Evangelical,
though he has shown a tendency at times to High
Churchism, and he “is opposed to the prosecution

The Bishop of Exeter has done at least
one thing that is worthy of a decent and honest
Bishop: he has declared that the polygamous
heathen w : ho desires to be admitted to the Chris-
tian Church should not he required to reduce his
harem to one wife before baptism. It is to be
feared, however, that this theory will seriously
demoralise the missionary business. Hitherto the
hoary African reprobate, the oily, greasy, and
much-married Polynesian, and the ancient scalp-
hunting Indian with seven mothers-in-law, have
joined the Church and found salvation in order
that they might sack all their feminine belongings
except the youngest and prettiest. The savage
prefers to get rid of the wife of his youth who has
ground his corn for 10 years, until she grew old,
and wrinkled' and withered, and so when the
wandering gospeliser explains the position he gets
saved right off and lands the aged woman outside
the seraglio in two kicks. Naturally, the fossilised
wives who are thus treated don’t get saved to any
serious extent; in fact, they generally curse the
gospeliser and all his tribe, and die drunk through
their husband’s sudden sanctification. It is a pity
a few more bishops havm not looked up this point;
there isn’t any dividend in it, hut it deserves at-
tention, and if the converted savage is required in
future to support all his wives instead of turning
out the old and ugly ones to starve in the name of
the Lord, there will he a better show, both for his
soul and the bishop’s, in the great hereafter,

Speaking of Dr. Pearson’s translation,
“At'as” in the World says: “That Bishop

effective aid to the Colonial Church would be the
graves of a few of its bishops in their dioceses.”

of the real pantomime, when grace u ges ures
spoke as eloquently as learned tongues, should
have witnessed a'recent sensational performance
at St. Leonards, Geelong. It appears that a lad
named Hood was riding a horse when his brother,
who is deaf and dumb, conceived a brilliant idea
of fixing up a little pantomime for ihe benefit of
those around. Arming himself with a fis ful of
nettles he kissed his handTo the audience, danced
gaily up to the family steed, and cunningly m-
sorted the stingers under the charger s tail, this
appeared to be such a side-splitting piece of plea-
santry that Master Hood had to hold his stomach
and bend down to smother his laughter and whilst
he was in this position the horse thought he and help
the fun along by a little pantomime of his own.
Drawing his right foot up to a level with his right
side, therefore, he looked round with an artful
smile at the first performer, and then suddenly
shooting back his uplifted leg he took Master
Hood a kick under the eaves of his pants that
lifted him as high as the price of house-rent. See-
ing this, the other Master Hood came down from
his frisky steed, and placing his thumb to his nose
began to windmill his fingers at his brother, and
caper round the yard like a drunken harlequin —
such being his playful way of expressing the de-
light he felt at his brother's catastrophe. Not a
single word had been spoken, and yet everyone
knew exactly what the performers meant; the
gestures of the horse-being particularly marked
and w r ell rendered. When the first performer
found his feet again, and had picked the mud out
of his nose, and caught sight of his brother’s glee-
ful antics, he suddenly thought of a first-class
tableau which would bring the entertainment to a
fitting close. Accordingly, he rushed into the
house, got a loaded gun, and filled his brother up
with the contents so effectually that his capers
came to a rather abrupt ending. Then the police
arrived, the usual stage rally ensued, and the per-
formance was over. Theatrical managers should
stick a pin in this item with a view to their
Christmas entertainments.

Anew light is beginning 'to be thrown on
the “outrages” perpetrated by the blacks in the
Kimberley district. Water is scarce in that desert
of dust and rock where the sky is like heated brass
above, and the diggers who were inarching in pur-
suit of the great alluvial lie ahead were camped
round every water-hole. The result was that
when the savage came down to imbibe at some
lonely ditch with a dead wallaby floating on the
top, he found his enemy in possession of the whole
stock of mud and effluvia, and straightway he
commenced to sow some wild oats and reap them
with a boomerang. A few diggers were killed
but for eveiy one of them a dozen of the weary’
thirsty, ‘ ‘ lords of the soil ” were generally wiped
out, and their remains were entombed inside the
unlicensed dog of the west, who carries their bones
in his gizzard and howls the accompanying
epitaph. This sort of thing is especially hard on
the youthful blackfellow. He can’t pray at his
father's tomb, for the tomb has the mange and is
galloping round on four legs ; he can’t plant white
flowers over the grave, for flowers won’t grow on a
dog's back, and anyhow he wouldn’t stand still
long enough to allow of the experiment; and if he
wants to pay reverence to the old man’s remains
his only chance is to chase the howling mausoleum
for perhaps 20 miles, and when he has captured
and killed it he can hang it up to dry, and then in
after years he may find a sad pleasure in pointing
out the remains of the dingo to his children, and
telling them that it is their grandfather. After
all, we think the white man has got all the best
of it in the Kimberley outrages, and if he wants
vengeance he had better go out and pot a prospec-
tor, and leave the blackfellow alone.

In a struggle between a Maori and a
Hebrew bailiff it is always best to back the copper-
coloured savage, for he generally comes out on
top. The other day one of the sons of Shimei
went forth to seize a native’s horse, and the
aboriginal seeing him approach got into the saddle
and prepaied for a race. Before he could start,
however, Moses was hanging on to the bridle
with the energy of Abbott’s four hundred and
ninth alleged cousin holding on to a N.8.W,
Civil Service billet; an old woman was also hang-
ing on to Moses in the effort to drag him away,
and a dozen natives were whooping around and
cheering on the combatants. But the grabbing
Jebusite held his own against all odds for fully
five minutes, and then the hoary female took a
mean advantage of him. She produced a kni.'e
and deliberately severed his braces, then with a
jerk she hoisted up his feet, leaving him hanging
by his hands only, and clutching the lower ends
of his pants the old lady started to run. The gar-
ment naturally followed. Then ensued a yell from
the crowd ; the native female cackled venomously
and headed in a north-eastern direction still haul-
at the pants ; there was an agonised “ s’help me ”
from the man of Hebrew extraction, a wild,
windmill-like whirl of Jewish legs in the chilly
atmosphere, and the bailiff let go the horse that
he might chase the essential garment which was
so suddenly becoming scarce. He was in time to
save it, but meanwhile the Maori and the horse
made a straight streak of dust into the dim
remote.

While princes guzzle, gorge, and sleep ;
That fact won’t the peace destroy
Of Beety and her baby boy.
Blessed thing is noble birth !
Nobler far than simple worth.
Tennyson has changed, you know,
Since he said it wasn’t so—
His feeble pen he may employ
To butter Beety’s baby boy.
Mothers, with your babes at breast,
Read, mark, inwardly digest;
Teach those babes, when older grown,
That this babe’s better than your own—
That millions to this life are born
For tens to hold in royal scorn ;
Ay, teach your pets to “ know their place,”
And lisp “Your Highness,” or “Your Grace;”
Let them pray, poor little dears,
That we may have Colonial Peers.
Meanwhile the tidings sweet enjoy,
That Beety’s got a baby boy.

Wanted—Dead Bishops.
Our bishops are birds of passage
Who never for long remain—
They bring us the Master’s message,
Then fly away “ home ” again ;
Oh, we notice, with secret sorrow,
That the bishop who’s here to-day
Is most certainly gone to-morrow —
Right tiddleiumtitay.
For as soon as an English billot
Is offered (with larger screw)
They’re off like a shot to fill it,
And bid us a fond adieu ;
They leave us their heaits best wishes,
Most beautiful things they say,
As they go for the loaves and fishes —
Right tiddleiumtitay.
This slate of affairs is awful;
The Colonial Church can’t thrive ;
It ought to be made unlawful
For the b’s to go back alive ;
’Tis their bodies are badly wanted,
But they carry them safe away—
All our bishops at home are “ planted ’
Right tiddleiumtitay.
Though the notion a trifle odd is
(A necessity we deplore)
We must write home, at once, for bodies
Of bishops who’ve “ gone before
Then, possessed of such saintly treasure,
Our Church will rejoice away—
Oh ! we’ll bury the lot with pleasure,
Right tiddleiumtitay.
SUCH IS LIFE.
Master Bertie cut a dash,
Cut a dash at Ballarat;
Barmaids fair he used to mash,
Used to mash but what of that?
Any cove who spends his coin
Must a barmaid’s heart purloin.
Master Bert to four proposed,
Only in the usual way ;
Two of ’em were well-disposed,
Other two returned a “ nay.”
But whether it was “ no ” or “yes ”
What's a couple, more or less ?
In our verdant giddy days,
Giddy days of long ago,
We ourselves, had winning ways,
Very winning ways, yen know.
Twixt the puffs at our cigar,
We have wooed across the bar.
Full of little tender tricks,
Little tender tricks, were we.
Oftentimes we married six,
Six, and never less than three.
When the funds were running down,
We skedaddled from the towm.
Master Bertie was no worse,
Was no worse than other chaps.
When he’d money in his purse
Smiling Hebes set their caps,
Touching finis to the tale,
Bobby took him off to gaol.


POLITICAL
POINTS
The population ofN.S. W. is one million
whereof 21,000 are civil servants.
In N.S.W. in 1876 the average area o:
freehold estates was 315 acres. Last year it had
risen to 881 acres.
Since the passing of the Chinese Restric
lion Act of 1882, the number of these aliens in the
States has been decreasing at the rate of 11,000
year.
The Sydney Daily Telegraph says “ Sir
Henry Parkes is still a strong leader.” This i
a doubtful compliment. We once heard it paid to
skunk.
Education cost 14s. 3d. per head of popu
lation in N.S.W. during last year. Yet severa
Justices of the Peace still spell “signed ” withou
a “ g ” or an “e.”
The amount of State aid to the various
religious denominations of N.S.W. in 1885 was
£11,229. Of this total £6,010 was paid to the
Anglican clergy, and £3,000 to Roman Catholics.
‘ ‘ The squatters are the backbone of Aus
tralia,” says a writer in the Melbourne Argus. If
this be true, Australia must (metaphorically
speaking) be suffering from curvature of the spine
Can it be true, as alleged, that since the
change in the style of tickets used on the Sydney
tram lines the Department has had returned to it
nearly a million tickets which were never issued
by it ?
Mr. John Bergan, who runs a woollen mil
in Freetrade N.S.W., states that not one similar
factory in the colony is making 1 per cent, on the
capital invested and that some of them are work
ing at a loss.
O’Donovan Rossa has, it is cabled, “ been
deposed by the American dynamiters owing to his
recent inactivity.” The cablegram doesn’t say
what O’Donovan has been deposed from, but we
presume it was a rum-cask.
The eagle eye of the Monaro Mercury
perceives in the offer of the N.S.W. Chief-Justice-
ship to Mr. Salomons, Q. C., a desire on the part of
the Premier to set up a Hebrew for the purpose of
keeping the balance between orange and green.
Mr. Abigail’s constituents tried to draw
him the other day on the subject of Protection,
but Parkes’ fugle man only sat on a rail and
smiled, and it was worth going ten miles in a
wheelbarrow drawn by a cow and a dog to see
that smile.
Mr. Dibbs thinks the N.S.W. newspapers
‘ ‘ do not as a rule give an honest interpretation of
the proceedings of Parliament.” If a man were
particularly bilious he might be inclined to ask—
“ Who could give an honest interpretation of a
drunken swindle 2 ”
In N.S.W. there are 563 freehold estates
each over 10,000 acres in extent, and containing
altogether 21,043,460 acres. Land monopoly is
making immense progress within the colony.
These huge estates are together equal to 68 per
cent of the total freeholds.
Mr. J. P. T. Caulfield has combined jour-
nalism with politics, having assumed the editor-
ship of the Lithgow Mercury. Among other
light reading the first issue under the new
management contains a five-column report of a
speech by the Irrepressible one. That is sufficient
to make any paper hum.
The Down and Gumtbbe Jernil publishes
a recipe for taking the mildew out of canvas. If
it could only invent some way of removing the
mildew that seems to have settled on the Opposi-
tion stump-campaigner’s canvass every Free-trader
in the land would take a copy of the Jernil and
possibly one or two might actually find time to
read it.
The good cause must be making some
headway in England. We find the Referee say-
ing : — “ A portion at least of the natural incre-
ment of the soil of every country should go into
the coffers of the State for the benefit of the na-
tion at large.” Little straws of comfort like this
show in what direction the wind of popular opinion
is blowing.
The Queen, finding it impossible to run
the United Kingdom solely on the advice of Mr.
Dailey, has been compelled to make Sir George
Bowen a P.C. It is thought that with one Right
Honorable at Manly and another at Hong Kong
the peace and security of the Empire is assured.
Mr. Dailey will shortly proceed to England for the
purpose of being sworn in.
Vanity Fair regards Lord Churchill’s
Dartford speech as “alarming because he dis-
tinctly intimates that the Government mean to
rely for their existence on a renewal of that pro-
cess of universal tinkering which belongs pro
perly to the Revolutionary Party alone.” Which
means that Lord Randolph has “ turned dog ” on
the Tories, and gone in for Home reforms.
The N.S.W. Ministry have decided to
“ Black Wednesday ” a very large number of
civil servants, but they are doing the work gradu-
ally. Last week several professional officers,
with salaries of from £350 to £5OO, received intima-
tion that their services were no longer required,
and that they could claim compensation for loss of
office at the rate of a month’s pay for every year
of service.
Vanity Fair calls Sir John Lubbock “ a
mischievous sentimentalist ” because he talks of
bringing in a Bill to provide for the closing of
shops at 8 p.m. “ This nonsense must be knocked
on the head,” yells the enraged journal, unaware
of the fact that the tyranny which enslaves the
labouring classes is on the verge of having its
head smashed into as many pieces as there are
drops in the Atlantic Ocean.
One Warton — whoever he may be —has
been fixed up with a square feed by the St
George’s Club—whatever it may be also. When
Warton couldn’t hold any more he arose and said
that “he went to Australia with the hope of
cementing the union between the mother country
and the colonies,” and the club rapped its thick
end on the table in applause at the meaningless
hiccup of another Imperial Federationist. Now
who in thunder is this kindly patrdJimhg Warton
man ? John M‘lntyre is leaving for London to
float a big Victorian gold-mining company. This
is another way of cementing, and a better one
than crowding up an obscure Englishman with
victuals.
Mr. D. A. Ferguson, M.L.A., has been
expelled from the Mumbil (N.S.W.) Farmers’
Union because, as it is alleged, his subscription
had fallen into arrears to the extent of Is. It is a
bad look-out for Mumbil when its capitalists
cannot subscribe eight drinks to square up an
account which a member of Parliament has
allowed to stand over. Or more likely they have
a sturdy irreverence and sceptical disbelief in
Ms.L.A.
The Armidalo Chronkxk thinks there
can hardly be anything more ridiculous than the
sight of a N.S.W. Cabinet Minister standing on an
inverted cask, haranguing five old women, one
boy, and the four-horse teamster who does all the
traffic for 50 miles round, and telling them that
“their important and rapidly increasing district
should have a railway, and if he has any voice in
the government of the country a railway they
shall have.”
The sale of Australian wines at the
Colonies Exhibition seems, from statements in re-
cent exchanges, to have been entirely controlled by
Messrs. Burgoyne and Co , who according to
Vanity Fair would only permit such brands' as
were on their list to be consumed. “ This,” says
the same authority, is not merely a grievance, it
is a monstrous scandal, and even if it stood alone
(which it does not), should be sufficient to prevent

the South Kensington Gang, either collectively
or individually, from being allowed to have any-
thing whatever to do with the management of
any further Exhibition or Institute.
Even the soi-disant democratic Globe has
a part in the great unceasing Smith-grovel of
N.S.W, The other day Lord Carington, inspect-
ing the soon-to-be-ahandoned Lachlan Water Re-
serve, suggested that it should be turned into a
public recreation ground, and the Globe straight-
way sat down on the damp grass to express its ad-
miration at the greatness and originality of an
idea that was first mooted long before Augustus
Loftus’ junior hen saw the light of day.
The appointment of Mr. W. H. Traill,
late of The Bulletin, as third Com-
missioner to enquire into the working of the N. S. IV.
Lands Department proves that the Govern-
ment really want to pull matters a bit straight.
Mr. Traillbringslargeexperience to the work,leav-
ing had an intimateacquaintance of the working of
the Queensland Land Acts and offices. His book,
the “Selector’s Guide,” written some years ago,
is still a standard in the Northern colony.
When the Russian man-of-war, Yestnik,
visited Wellington (N.Z.), a resident whq wcnt on
board on business saw a number of plans and
photographs of the defence-works and fortifica-
tions in one of the deck-houses. He also saw a
theodolite and photographic apparatus in the same
place. Evidently the Russians on their late cruise
i were bent on taking advantage of their oppor-
tunities when they visited the colonies, for no
doubt what was done at Wellington was also done
in other places.
Mr. “Jack” Want, at Cootamundra,
(N.S.W.) on a member of the Parkes party in
Parliament :
“He was a little gentleman called Dr. Wilkinson, He
was very harmless in his way, and it was difficult to say
whether he was a boy or a girl. If he lived in the doctor's
town he would (Laughter.)
Audit might astonish them to know that the gentleman
who made this accusation against him to a great extent de-
pended for his living on the salary he gets as lecturer at the
■University, where he gets 15300 a year and has only one
pupil. ’
“Nancy” Wilkinson will he the little doctor’s
title in future.
The Deccan (India) Times states that a
man has recently been released at Hanamcondah
after lying in prison awaiting trial for 16 years.
There was nothing proved against him, hut he
had been run in on suspicion in 1870 and the
authorities quite forgot he was there. According
to this, the rulers of India seem to he gradually
working up to the Russian standard. The
Emperor Alexander I. once found an officer flirt-
ing with his particular girl and sent him up for
three days as a hint to be more careful. But hi
quite forgot about his prisoner at the end of thi
time, and it was not till 50 years afterwards (ha
Gortschakoff, going through the gaol, accidental!}

Mr. T. H. Coghlan, the Government
Statistician of New South Wales, shows well in
his first flutter among the figures. The Statistical
Register for 1885 bears on many pages the marks
of his attention, and the Handbook by which it is
accompanied is certain to be a “ real blessing to
mothers,” and all other persons who have an
interest in the political future of Australia. Dis-
figured as it unfortunately is by several, if not
more, clerical and printer’s errors, it is neverthe-
less a credit to its editor and a justification of his
recent appointment,
“From all quarters of the globe,” cried
Sir George Bowen, in a recent hair-raising speech
at Glasgow, “ ships will come crowded with
soldiers who will say the Empire shall not perish.”
Just so. And ships might come from all quarters
of the globe crowded with soldiers who would say
that beer would in future sell at a penny a quart.
“Saying” is about the cheapest thing we know,
but unless the “soldiers” did something more
than eat tinned food on the tented Held and jaw
as they shoved down the stalled ox the Empire
might bust all the same.
A week or two back a Melbourne working-
man got into trouble for playfully “flicking” the
fiery steed of an officer —in uniform. A ittle
article on “Men in Buckram” appeared in these
columns, and is bearing fruit abundantly. The
Melbourne Herai.d has now arrived at the sensible
conclusion that “Australia is never likely to be-
come a military nation, and military swells arro-
gate to themselves a reflected glory to which they
have no right. There has been of late too much
of this military mountebankism, and it is time it
was put an end to. Indeed, it is a question
whether, in a Democratic country like ours, some
of the gew-gaws, the lace, and the feathers, might
not with advantage be dropped.” Even the
autocratic Argus opened one of its bleary eyes
and took in the situation. Only the other day that
ardent supporter of everything that is and
oughtn’t to be, reminded its bcraildewed readers
that America had no difficulty in raising armies
“ when it wanted them.” There is much agitation
in warlike circles. Warlike circles have dei ided
that “ the Service is going to the devil, sir.” In
that- case, the Service will be returning, like the
prodigal, to the home of its father.
When Mr. Michael Burke lifts his hind
legs in the air and brings them down with a crash
on the keyboard of fame the consequences are
fiendish. He did this lately at Tamworth, and
the following quotation from his speech shows how
he did it :
“ Mr. Abbott has been professing to make the same amend-
meats as I was professing to do, and I Mipportfdthc Govern-
ment for these reasons. I supported the next (xovemment
for entirely different reasons, and I will support every Go-
vernment in power, because I want to see noy country lifted
out of its present difficulties ? ”
There is as much difference in some people as any-
body. This remark is rather vague, but not so
vague as Mr. Burke, That gentlemen, it seems,
was professing to do something, and Mr. Abbott
was professing to do the same, andneither of them
did it, hut Burko supported Abbott for that very
reason. He hacked the Government because they
thought as he did, and he backed the next Govern-
ment “ for very different reasons,” i.e., because
their views were contrary to his, and because the}
deemed Mr. Burke an immorta} ass. He is alsogo-
ing to back every other Government that may
turn up, and he doesn’t care a tinsmith s execra-
tion what their views are. M e wonder if it really
is Mr. Burke’s intellect that is marked on the map
as the Great African Desert ?
The Victorian Opposition — headed by a
clique of ex-railway bunglers—is endeavouring to
hatch a scheme for playing gehonna with the only
remunerative branch of the Civil service. Mr.
Speight, the imported Chief Commissioner of
Railways, is required to have the assistance of tw o
minor commissioners. The aides originally ap-
pointed were solid men, who put in some work,
drew a quiet a year, and didn t stand in the
way of the chief s reforms. One of them is sfciJi
pursuing his career of negative usefulness, but the
otner was recently removed to a higher sphere,
where there is no goods traffic, and passengers
make their journeys with wings, regardless of
class ’ distinctions. Upon the vacant Commis-
sionership is the glittering orb of the Opposition
greedily fixed. There is the opening wherein to
insert the wedge which shall oust the too-success-
ful Speight and bring back chaos. They have hit
upon 'tarbrush Woods as a likely wedge. John
Woods, who bossed the railways in the good old
days of yore and introduced a bone-shaking brake
of mongrel breed, ii (lie man of their choice. Got
him in the billet, and Mr. Speight will have the
choice of three things—resignation, madness, or
death. In order to secure this glorious end, Mr.
Tommy Bent and his crowd will “job” till
further orders. They are prepared to let the
Government create another portfolio, and vote
themselves what they will provided the buzzing
\V oods is allowed to blow upon the present system
of railway management. With Duncan Gillies at
the head of one party, and Bent managing the
other, no terms of truce are too iniquitous to bo
out of the question. They have both disclaimed
any knowledge of the meditated arrangement,
which is in itself a suspicious circumstance. The
railway-travelling public are prepared for the
worst.
The banquet given by Mayor Young, of
Sydney, to Sir H. Fowler, late Lord Mayor of Lon-
don, was not in every respect a success. The cups
and saucers were numerous, but there was a
weary and exhausted look about the victuals, or,
as the E. News put it, “ What was on the tables
consisted more of certain necessary appliances for
consuming food than of any particularly agreeable
food to be consumed. ” There was also a tendency to
erratic playing on the part of the choir, or what-
ever it should be called, the man with the horse-
hair and the interior of the cat executing wild
pranks which the man who blew into the bit of
gaspipe could not keep pace with. “ Sir Wobert”
tried to look interested, but he gazed on the first
"specimen of victuals on the end of his fork with a
thoughtful now-what-the-dcuce-are ycu sort of
expression, that seemed to imply the existence of
a coolness between him and his food. Sir Patrick,
that respectable Irishman aged 55,” as a Queens-
land journal usually terms him, made a spcechj in
which ho complimented the guest on having ruled
“ the greatest city the world ever saw,” but as
man is said to have been on the earth for 210,000
years the assertion was a rash one unless
the Premier has some private informa-
tion regarding the past which nobody
else knows. He also grovelled a little about
“ the federation of an empire of some 300,000,000
souls, ’ just as if any white man would federate in
such an empire and let himself be ruled by a
majority consisting of more than 250,000,000
niggers and Chinamen. He got mixed, too, a
little further on, and said the Anglo-Saxons were
“subduing the earth and making it the most
perfect the world has ever seen,” as if he had seen
a large assortment of earths and was in the habit
of going out and inspecting a few new ones before
breakfast. Sir Robert Fowler, in reply, said that
he liked the harbour, and wished he had seen Par-
liament in session, and Sir Patrick tottered and
shuddered at the idea. Then Mr. Bradley said
that he thought the Ministry were “ fairly intelli-
gent” and advised people not to throw away dirty
water rashly, and the Premier rose to respond on
behalf of the unclean slops. Lastly, Mr. Barton
alluded to political “conviction,” and the only
mistake he omitted to make was that of alluding
to tickets of leave. Then there was more drinking
and the gorgeous assemblage burst up at 10.15 p.m.

SUPPLEMENT TO “THE BULLETIN," SYDNEY, 4th DECEMBER, 1886.
The subject of this biography gave no very eaYly promise of the
great career for which he was destined. On the contrary he evinced
an aversion for water in any form that may be described as almost
precocious.
Later on he developed a passion for aquatics
which seemed almost abnormal. His poetic
Mind transmogrified a bath-tub into a rowing-
oourse, an old shoe into a boat, and his pet
kitten became a champion sculler.
His parents observed with dark forebodings
these early indications- of the natural bent of his
mind, and sought to turn his thoughts into other
channels They had designed him folr Parliament,
and knew too well that no one could reach theke
by water.

Ine boy grew, and secretly cherished his passion forv'
acquatics. One Sunday, when his parents were-"
asleep (in the neighbouring chapel), he took the/
barn door off the hinges, and launching it
upon an adjacent gooee-pond, he/
found himself afloat for the first
time. His delight is plainly,
visiblem the expression
of his back, y'

matta River, and made such rapid progress that
he soon passed everything on the course. (Oppo-

Then it was that he re-

the Government tf'ind-niill, near Dapto, at a wretched
pittance of £tooo a year, which was a plucky thing in a

At Government House on Wednesday
evening, the 24th, Lord Carington gave a large
dinner party in honour of Sir Robert Fowler,
Among the guests were Sir George Verdon, the
Hon. Mr. Dailey, Mr. Salomons, Captain Musgrave,
Sir George Innes, Mr. T. Fowler, Sir Patrick
Jennings, Sir John Hay, Judge Dowling, the Hon.
G. R. Dibbs, and the Hon. J. W. Lyno.

Captain Lake and the officers of H.M.S.
Nelson gave another dance on board their ship in
Melbourne, on Tuesday afternoon, the 23rd. The
vessel was as usual beautifully decorated, and
everything passed off well. The guests, of whom
there were about 400, included His Excellency the
Governor and Lady Loch, the Marquis and Mar-
chioness of Stafford and Viscount Tarbat, Lord
Deerhurst, Mr. Sturgess, Colonel Walker, Mr.
and Mrs. Malleson, Mr. and Mrs. Donald Wallace,
and many other Melbourne fashionables.
* * *
Rain damps almost everything, but it can-
not wash oubthat deep-seated loyalty that dwellsin
the heart of the average Sydney female of fashion.
Consequently, though the rain came down enough
to make Noah think it was misty, the loyal dames
flocked to Lady Carington’s usual garden party,
last Thursday. On this occasion the garden was
transferred to the drawing room, on the soles of
the “ladies’” shoes, with disastrous results to
the carpet. We had the curiosity to ask a
“frequenter” why she went on a day obviously
designed by nature to give Lady Carington a
spell; “Oh, she said, don’t you know? Why of
of course on a wet day we have dear Lady C.
so much more with us, and can hear her talk,
while at a ‘crush’she is quite unapproachable.
That is why.”
* * *
On Thursday, the 25th ult., Miss Essie
Jenyns received a first benefit at the Sydney
Opera House. She was Juliet, though Mercutio
was of a different opinion and kept calling her
Rosalind. This was a little confusing, but Juliet
did not seem to mind. She’s a good-natured girl.
The house was packed in every part, and the
young actress received a splendid ovation, wreaths
of flowers being flung at her in wild profusion.
Of course, she charmed every one, nearly—for
there were a few adverse critics, notably a lady
who said she did not think Essie equal to Nellie
Stewart, as the latter made a better yum-yum,
No doubt she does. The criticism is just. In the
dress-circle a good collection of the aristocracy
were present. H.E. and Lady Carington smiled
on the play and populace. In their box was “ our
latest bride,” Mrs. Colonel Bingham. She looked
very charming in a low dress of pink and white
silk trimmed with lace. There was also present a
strange gentleman whom we were told was a
Marquis. Perhaps he was, they’re pretty hard to
tell since they gave up wearing crowns and robes,
and dressed like the universal waiter. Among
the ladies present wore Mrs. J. M. Purves, Miss
B. Metcalf, and Mrs. Macmillan, whom, during
her English tour, London society journals have
been wont to designate as “ the fair Australian.
* * *
The complications that have arisen owing
to the resignation by Mr. Salomons of
the N.S.W. Chief-Justiceship appear to be
endless. Like Sir W. Manning, His Excellency
“ had it in contemplation to ask the gentleman to
dinner,” and had so far committed himself as to
invite many highly distinguished persons to meet
him. They all accepted ! Then came the trouble :
the gentleman was not the Chief Justice, and, as
simple Julian Salomons, H.E. saw no more points
about him than about any other barrister. What
was he to do ? Why, go on with the dinner and
leave a chair vacant at the table for the Chief
Justice who ever he might bo. This he did, but
that chair was not sat on during the feast, Banco’s
ghost being engaged at a “ seance.”
* *
It appears doubtful as to whether young
Lord Dudley, who is to illuminate Sydney for a
while, is to come in the charge of his mother, or of
a professional bear-leader. As the future law-giver
of England is only twenty years of age, it is
thought necessary that he should not be permitted
to go a “ lone hand ” among the seductive maidens
of Potts Point. W e would prefer to see
him in charge of his mother, she being one of the
famous beauties of her day. His superfine Lord-
ship’s papa in his latter years rather upset the
domestic proprieties by a fancy he had that he
was to be made not only a happy father, bub a
happy mother. The idea was unusual and em-
barrasing, as his lordship took care to be provided
w ith all the elaborate accessories befitting so im-
portant an occasion.
* * *
The legitimate successor to the throne of
England has been secured by the safe arrival of
dear little Bat. Perhaps no country in the world
is harder up for princes than Britain, as it is said
not to have more than two to the square mile
counting swamps.
* * *
There is much talk in London just now
about the expediency of so altering the Royal
marriage law as to allow the children of H.R.H.
of Wales to marry English subjects. At present
these young people can wed anything foreign if
it’s royal, from a Zulu chief to a Kalmuck laitar.
So that he is nob English he may be of any shade
of colour, Protestant religion preferred, though
this obstacle is usually got over without any vio-
lent struggle on the part of the convert. Under
the proposed system the Royal family would be
English in about ten centuries, and have scarcely
enough German cousins left to make a standing
arm y. The Queen is understood to be greatly op-
posed to this scheme as her poor relations would
be thrown upon the German parish, where they
only give out-door relief. We arc not told from
whom the proposal comes, as H.R.H. is almost a
pure German, the Queen being four-fifths of that
nationality, and his father a pure, very, native of
the land of Krout. This does not leave much of
the English element in Wales, though we hear
him spoken of as a true British gentleman !
* * *
Ho phase of Australian toadyism and
sycophancy is more revolting than that which
takes the form of- abject worship of English
opinion. Without the hall-mark of London ap-
proval no Australian literary labour, however
meritorious, receives the slightest attention. A
few lines of Gordon, quoted by an English novelist,
first revealed to a Melbourne public that they had
a poet among them. Lord Rosebery’s “ dis-
covery ” of Marcus Clarke sent that writer's name
up in a manner his works alone never could have
done. FarjeonandMrs. Campbell Praed, neglected
in Australia, send us Action from London that is
hailed with acclamation. But perhaps the most
singular instance of this form of grovel is presented
to us in the case of Mr. Bernard Wise, the young
Sydney barrister. This gentleman wrote a paper
for a local journal. The article fell fiat on the
public. You see it was only Australian. But
the author felt that there was merit in his work.
He sent it home ; it was not only immediately
published, but was highly praised by the London
press. Back it comes to its native country. It
bears the impress of English approval, and we
actually meet in a Sydney daily with a review
upon it almost as long as the original article !
We scarcely wonder that any man of talent who
can hire a steerage passage in a coal-hulk, makes
for Europe, and when he gets there stays.

That gilded Potts Point youth, Mr.
Frederick M'Quade, seems to have been going the
whole monetary hog—and a Brobdignagiau one,
too —for the last 26 months, and his red, red gold
has been flowing into the coffers of the Hebrews as
the waters go down at Lodore, only a good deal
more so. In an affidavit which he filed at Sydney
Equity Court, the other day, he swmars upon a
speckled hen and a blown-out match to the follow-
ing effect: That he came into some valuable city
property in Sydney in 1884 and straightway,
through the medium of a “friend,” one Allison,
arranged to borrow £lO,OOO from the countrymen
of the wise old King with the 700 wives ; that he
was introduced to our dear old friends the Mel-
bourne 1400 per shenters, Marks Herman and Aaron
Waxman, also to Mark Moss, who conjointly found
himthesumrequireduponmortgage, and stipulated
HERO WORSHIP.

ihatthoy were to get a bonus of £.5000 for the use of
the money for one year, likewise interest on £15,000
after the expiry of the year at 10 or 12 per cent.,
and another £IOOO for mental anxiety, worry, and
botheration incurred by the relatives of the King
with the 700 wives in fixing up the transaction ;
that, upon receiving the £IO,OOO, the trio of good
Samaritans hunted him into another room where
they got from him in cash the £IOOO bonus and
£SOO, being a half-year’s interest in advance ; that
one of the trio and a fresh Jew—a little one—per-
formed wonderful feats of leg in the direction of
the railway station, and, finding him there, de-
manded another £2OO as commission for the fresh
little Jew, a claim which was afterwards raised to
£SOO ; and, in short, that he made himself respon-
sible for £6175 as one year's bonus for the use of
£9OOO. Then he borrowed £350 from the fresh
little Jew and gave him cheques payable three
months ahead for £750, and the whole shivoo
ended by the gorgeous Potts Pointer finding him-
self up a tree for some £26,000. All those things
are vanity.

“What’s in a name?” In Melbourne
Divorce Court, Sarah Virtue has obtained a decree
nisi for divorce against Andrew Fuller Virtue, on
the ground of adultery and desertion. Virtue
deserts Virtue and so loses his Virtue. Virtue
then sues to be released from her Virtue on the
ground that he has no virtue at all. But she has
already lost her own Virtue, and he has given
away his Virtue, Wherein, then, lies the action ?

Viscount Tarhat has come over with the
Marquis and Marchioness of Stafford. Melbourne
sassiety has concocted a mild joke, The new-
comer is known as Turbot,
Only 59 suicides were registered in N. S. W.
during 1885. Yet 7618 marriages were recorded
in that year.

The stays of fashionable ladies are now
made entirely of sheet-metal, and resemble a
cuirass. Consequently, when you put your arm
round a darling, got up a la mode, you feel as if
jou were embracing a sardine-tin in evening dress.
A well-known London dude, engaged to an
opera-bouffe maiden, “has had her Christian
name tatooed in bold capitals all the way up his
arm.” By the time this devoted creature has
formed a few more attachments he will be tatooed
11l over his body. And when he finally gets
narried how is he to persuade his wife that she is
he only woman he ever loved !
* * *
A correspondent thus addresses The Bul-
etin on the subject of the R.C. Church and the
larriage with a deceased wife’s sister question :
It is necessary, according to the laws of the R.C. Church
o obtain a “ dispensation ” before such a marriage is ecclesi-
stionllv leaal But many critics, especially over-correct
Jatholics, forget that the plan laid down by the Church is to
■ive a rule with an exception. Her procedure is to be taken
; S a whole, and it is strange loyalty to her to except her
.uthority as to the general rule, and then cry out in horror it
he grants a dispensation. The proceedure taken as a whole
trikes me as simply perfect. The general rule against such
mions avoids all awkwardness between sisters and
irevents thoughts of such marriages causing un-
deasantness beforehand, and then when the special
iccasion comes, when such a marriage is, of all
he very best imaginable, the permission can be obtamecl.
Hie public, Protestant and Catholic, who have not the
durden of legislating, and who have not the prudent kindness
vhich the Church shows for individuals, cry out against such
i wise plan and demand a hard-and-fast rule, either to have
ao rule or to forbid all exceptions. But surely it is ele-
mentary law that the authority Which can prescribe a law has
the power to abrogate it at its discretion. The only point
really open to discussion is as to the prudence of exercising a
discretion in individual cases; and it must be renie-mbered
that loyal Catholics believe in the Church’s power to bind, to
loose, and to judge wisely. The obtaining of a dispensation
is not, as has been supposed, a matter involving money.
When a dispensation it grantedi it costs only a letter ex-
plaining the circumstances.”

The Amurrikan Mrs. Grundy is playing the
dickens with Violet Cameron and Lord Lonsdale’s
opera-houffe spec. Ladies who have “any re-
spect for themselves, my dear,” hold aloof from
Violet’s show and leave it to bald-headed church-
wardens and misguided mashers. To make
matters worse, the bald-heads are disappointed in
Violet. Instead of the bouncing, melting, giddy
goddess of their dreams, they find a, cold, stately,
handsome, cruel-looking charmer. Biz, is seriously
affected by this discovery. And to make matters
worse still, Violet and her friend the Earl have
been politely “chucked” from the Hoffman
House. The manager told Lonsdale that the re
putation of his hotel was endangered by their
presence and the incidental hanging around of
Violet’s husband, Jeboshophatbut this was the
unkindest cut of all. The morally-outraged boss
of the Hoffmann House is Mr. Stokes, who mur-
dered Jim Fiske all on account of a strictly illegi-
timate love squabble. That little affair shook the
world something like 20 years ago. Stokes
wriggled out of the noose, put in “time,” and
subsequently took the hotel on the strength of his
ill-smelling fame. This is the man who, for pro-
priety’s sake, frowns upon the “ platonic” attach-
ment of an actress and her earl. Can it be that
Stokes’ virtue has mellowed with age, or does he
imagine that Violet’s chicken-hearted spouse is
also on the shoot I Perish such a sanguinary
thought!

Recently a clergyman’s wife appeared at
Sydney Water Police Court to claim an increased
allowance from her husband, from whom she had
been separated, and who had been allowing her
£4O a year. On this sum, it may be remembered,
Goldsmith’s much-married parson was “passing
rich,” but in these times the sum of £lO per annum
doesn’t enable a parson’s wife to dress passably.

Miss Lucy Pinkstone, who describes her-
self as “ the young English elocutionist,” gave a
reading of Dickens’ “Goblin Chimes” at the
Sydney School of Arts on Saturday night. We
don’t know from whom Miss Pinkstone has gained
her knowledge of elocution, but judging from the
guileless manner in which she drops her “ aitches ”
we can only imagine that she has been under the
tuition of that noble exponent of the art—Sir
Henry Parkes.
* * *
“ Humming Bee,” the gentlemanly lady of
the Sydney D.T , who daubs the paint of social re-
finement over the uncouth gable-end of the Aus-
tralian intellect, gets an inspiration now and then.
Here is the last one. Like some of the O’Gorman’s
lectures, it is meant “ for ladies only” :
‘'Wetri) to be as masculine as we can. Already we have
shirt fronts, shirt studs, collars and neckties, the narrow
linen tie hitherto sacred to evening dress, and which every
woman who wears shows how unused she is to its manipula-
tion by the bad bows she makes. This is bad enough in all
conscience, but next winter real waistcoats and cutaway
coats, over closely-fitting skirts, are promised us. Worse
still, some will wear them.”
We endorse the first part of this. Some of the
ladies do try to be masculine by wearing almost
everything ; some of them also try to be mascu-
line in their writings, but as their ideas of the
male stylo are confined to filling a pepper-bottle
with the smell of stale tobacco and “ damn” and
shaking it over their manuscript they don’t succeed
much. “ Humming Bee ” tried to write about a
cricket-match, the other day, and the best the
could do in the way of being masculine was to
say that Lord and Lady Carington “recognised
several of their acquaintances on their way to the
vice-regal box.” We have seen a cab-horse do as
much as that, though he was not on his way to a
vice-regal box.
* * *■
If that giddy old gallant, Mr, Dion
Boucicault, doesn’t slow down he will find himself
up to the ears in something remarkably like high
treason. It is currently reported that when the
divorce proceedings instituted by Agnes Robert-
son, who claims to be the only Mrs. D. B. and
declares all other brands to be spurious, comes on,
dear old Dion will set up a plea denying tl e
legality of his first marriage. This appears to be
a low-down way of wriggling out of the mess, and
it is just possible he may find himself badly bogged
by the following circumstance. A quarter of a
century ago, after the success of the “ Colleen
Bawn,” the joyful Dion had one copy of the pl&y
superbly printed and bound in velvet and gold,
with portraits of Agnes Robertson and himself as
a frontispiece, and this book he sent to Queen Vic-
toria, with the respectful compliments of Mr. and
Mrs. Boucicault. Now, the Queen forgets nolhing,
loses less, almost, and gives precious little away,
so this copy of the “ Colleen Bawn,” dedicated in
Bouci.’s own handwriting, is to be brought into
Court, together with a report of a speech made by
him in Boston in 1853, in which he was proud and
happy to tell his audience that he had ‘ ‘ married
the star of the evening.” All this may not be
strictly legal evidence, of course, but it will be
precious awkward stuff to explain to a loyal and
intelligent British jury. It is also said that a
family Bible, with the record of the marriage, has
been discovered, but even Boucicault’s worst
enemies decline to believe he ever went as far as
that. The moral of all this is : talk as much as
you please, but never write a single word which
in any way bears on your courtships or marriages.
In all probability, nothing would give our Sove-
reign Lady greater pleasure than to haul along
that big Bible and bang it over the amorous
Dion’s bald head.

A terrible barmaid row is going on in
England, and if the racket should extend to Aus-
tralia the civil servant, whose ears are impaled on
the points of his collar, will be blighted for ever.
The English barmaid is required to be a lady or
many qualifications ; she should be beautiful,
rather clever, agreeable, and prettily dressed, and
beneath her clothes she should hide the constitu-
tion of a riveted boiler-metal rhinoceros, and
she can “ chuck out ” on an emergency so much
the better. The latter qualification is an exceed-
ingly valuable one, but it is rare in woman ; so a
South Shields publican hired a powerful but hand-
some and rather effeminate-looking young man at
a high salary, and fixed him up in bangs and a
fringe and a crinolette, and all the rest of the out-
fit, and found him to answer admirably. He took
his fellow beerclogists into the secret, and all South
Shields was presently filled with nice-looking bar-
maids who could throw out a cart-horse with one
hand, and a coal-heaver and a policeman with the
other. The youthful swells of the town rather
liked these stalwart beauties, and mashed them
largely ; they also put their arms round their
waists and kissed them. But now, as the Maori
Prophet Te Whiti would put it, “the egg is blown,
the potato is cooked, the whole racket is busted
up.” Someone has given away the joke to the
police.
* * *
Promiscuous and unrestricted mashing is
to be abolished in the Salvation Army. General
Booth has issued an “order of the day” stating
that; —
“It having been brought under the notice of tb® st »
council that lieutenants expected headquarters to conae
to their courting and engagements, and that, msteau
trying to qualify themselves for captain?, their thoughts a
attentions were directed to their sweethearts, they have just
issued the following stringent order;— That in fntur
sanction will be given to courting or any engagement or •».
male lieutenant. He must get promoted to the iana
captain before anything of the kind can be' recognised.
This seems a first-class plan for bursting up the
Harmy altogether, for the lieutenants wfil stiu
“direct their thoughts and attentions to tnei
sweethearts,” and the result, as the S.M. lIBBAn
would say, will be “ undesirable.”

LAURA.
’Tis true the rose is passing fair,
’Tis true it giveth a fragrance rare,
But a tenderer grace
My sweet one’s face
Adorns ; and the Aidenn winds above
Might garner the breath of my lady-love.
’Tis true there gleams in ruddy wine
A sparkle of life and of fire divine ;
Can it match the glow
O’er her bosom’s snow 2
Can it match the fire of her dusky eyne 2
Can it warm the soul of this love of mine 2
’Tis true the lute can sweetly sigh
Till the rapt soul soars in ecstasy ;
Ah! one sweet note
From her dove-like throat
Would shame the breath of the Orphean lyre,
Or the muse’s song with its godlike fire.
And winter’s snow is purely pale,
And coldly chaste is winter’s gale—
But bright, though far
As even’s star,
And pure as the deep of cloudless skies,
Is the soul that beams from my lady’s eyes.

second time.
Two fashionable weddings will take place in Melbourne
next month. The first is the heir of Sir W. J. Clarke to Mis,
Gumming, of Waratah, Toorak ; the second, Mr. E. Mitchell,
son of the late Sir Fancourt Mitchell, to Miss Morrison.
Two other marriages also to take place in Melbourne
shortly are those of Miss Edith Jacobs, of East Melbourne,
to Mr. Louis Kaufman, of Adelaide; and the Rev. Marcus
Maines, of London, to Miss Louisa Isaacs of St. Kilda.
Mrs. Fred. Warskitt’s pupils assembled in the Protestant

sented Mrs. Warskitt with a very handsoma silver biscuit-
box and a pair of bronze figures.
An order of merit for servants of “ both sexes ” who have
served one master for thirty years has been successfully
started by a German Princeling. The order consists of a
cross, and the object is to induce servants to remain for ever
in our gmploy. Such a prospect as our hash-mechanio-
general remaining with us for thirty years is so appalling
that we would not accept any order, ribbon or garter what-
soever and 11 do” the time. And she wouldn’t either.

There is in Ballarat a Presbyterian clergy-

Montague Burney has been impersonating
Lord Carington, in Melbourne, and tendering
“Carington” cheques in payment for goods.
The man’s intelligent style of address awakened
a shopkeeper’s suspicions, and led to his arrest.
The Rev. James Hennessey, editor of the
Australian Christian World, has delivered a

we saw his name.
We regret to hear of the death of Mr.
Murray Smith’s only son at Oriel College, Oxford.
We are told that the whole of his fellow-students
followed his remains to the grave, and we are
sure that all the sympathy of Australia will go
with Mr. Smith in his sorrow.
A London paper, suggesting that Prince
Albert Victor should marry a home-grown girl,
says that the Black Prince, Henry IV., Henry
VIII., and James 11., married Englishwomen and
subjects. A reference to Bluff King Hal is par-
ticularly happy. The blood-thirsty old Mormon
married four subjects and murdered two of ’em.
One Sydney paper announces that Princess
Beatrice has given birth to “A Son another
alleges that she has given birth to a “Prince.”
We wonder which is right 2 As the parents of
the infant are penniless persons who loaf on the
British nation to the extent of many thousands
per annum, we incline to the belief that “ Prince”
is the correct term.
Henniker Heaton loves his mother-in-law
and means to keep on doing so, though it should
cost him every cent he's worth in this world. In
company with other distinguished gentlemen he

Bristol, and in responding to a toast he said he
should always love that city because the venerable
old lady had been married there.
When Judge Windeyer asked the nine
convicted Mount Rennie prisoners if they had
anything to say why sentence of death should not
be pronounced upon them, some of them might
have replied, in the words of the naive French
eriminal, “ We have only to plead, your Honor,
the youth of our counsel and the fact that we
have been defended gratuitously.”
“ Mr. H. B. Guppy is completing his
work on the Solomon Islands and their natives.”
So says a Melbourne paper. We wonder if this is

well—to alter Byron
O Mister Guppy !—Phcebuel what a name
To fill the speaking-trump of future fame I
Fill it! It will burst it.
The P.M. at Charters Towers (Q.) re-
cently stated that “any person calling another a
liar, simply gave the person so-called an invita-
tion to hit him, and any person not accepting the
invitation must be without spirit; this was an
understood thing amongst the people of all froth-
telling nations.” Which,however, is altogether too
thin for Thadeus O’Kane, who pats his nose in a
highly significant way and writes that “if the
hittee got summoned the P.M. would probably
fine him, and remark, as he did some time ago,
that he was detei mined to put down impromptu
pugilistic encounters.”
The Globe reports thus on the trial of the
Mount Rennie prisoners
“ At a Quarter to 11 the scarlet roles of Judge Windeyer
swept up the steps to the Bench. His face wore more than
its usual aspect of serei ity."
We wish to say frankly that we don’t believe this,
for we can’t see where Judge Windeyer could
stow that extra aspect. We have seen him on
many occasions, and his ordinary stock of ah,
yes, judicial smile, crowded up all the available
acreage, and hung over at the sides.
A sensational story is going the rounds of
the N.Z. press about Hall, of wife-poisoning
celebrity. It appears that that distinguished gen-
tleman, while on a visit to his father’s station,
near Timaru, some years ago, looked in one morn-
ing at a shepherd’s hut, and when the shepherd
returned home he found his wife and Mr. I [all
“ carrying on” in a way of which he strongly dis-
approved. The shepherd was a man of few
words. He shot his wife dead on the spot, and
kicked Hall out of the House. For this he was
sent up for life, and when Hall was taken to
Lyttelton Gaol the other day one of the first men
his eye lit upon was this identical shepherd, who,
with a curse, said, “ And so you have come at
last, have you 2 I knew you would, sooner or
later.” He rushed at Hall, and would have ren-
dered all further action concerning him unneces-
sary had not a warder interfered.
A pathetic interest still centres around
Mrs. Edith Mary Blythe, who unfortunately was
murdered at Newtown (N.S.W.) a little while ago.
Herewith we present her portrait, reproduced
from a recent photo. Married at 16, she was only
2 1 when the curtain was rung down on the
tragedy which closed her life. Her husband, who
to all appearance was also her murderer, was ton
years her senior. Their married life was not a
succession of joys, trouble intervening quite suffi-
ciently to prevent happiness from becoming mono-
tonous in its continuity.
The Bermagui mystery is getting old.
Some four or five years ago a party of surveyors,
headed by Mr. Lament Young, son of a distin-
guished Imperial- officer, started to cross a bay
near Bermagui, N.S.W. Their boat was found,
but they themselves disappeared, and were heard
of no more. The stipendiary clairvoyant of the
Sydney evening press now avers that the missing
men were not drowned, hut died from the effects
of strychnine administered in their tea. The
murderer, an individual with a scar on his cheek,
then threw the bodies of his victims into the sea,
there to rest among ozone and sardines till the
Judgment Day, and, stealing a horse, made off for
Victoria, where he now resides in a public-house.
THE WOES OF THE SERVICE.
STREET ARAB (to Montmorenci Jones of the Lands, who won't buy an evening paper):
“HI, HOW D’YE LIKE YER NINE TO FIVE,—HEY?”
Lumley Hill, M.P., of Queensland, rises
to make the following remarks on the subject of
journalism. He objects to the free conveyance of
newspapers by mail in that colony, and orates
thus: —
“Newspapers were utterly irresponsible, and nobody had
any check upon t v em. They dubbed themselves ‘we,’ and
called themselves 1 public opinion,’ and after all they only
gave the opinion of some fellow who slung scurrilous
personalities at the rate of 15s. a column. It did not m atter
to the writers of those articles; they could revile or abuse
anybody with perfect impunity, and they did. He was
speaking in the interests of the taxpayer; he himself, as one
of the taxpayers, had to contribute towards having their
rubbish hawked about all over the colony and into other
colonies for nothing, and he had a right to complain.”
Lumley Hill, we may mention, has something
to do with the sheep-shearing and hind-leg-of-
mutton business. Ho also looms up occasionally
in mines. Sheep, he finds, can get on without
newspapers, and the same rule often applies to
mines, also even to wild-cat mines. He has
a good reputation for pluck, which is built chiefly
on one unlucky incident. A big man once put a
huge knuckly fist in his face and told him that he
would drive his nose right through to the back of
his head, and Lumley, after taking stock of his
enemy’s dimensions, said calmly, “ Oh, you’d
better go to my manager. He attends to all that
sort of business for me.”
A moderately respectable member of the
British aristocracy has started for the next world.
His name was Lord Henry Lennox, and he lived
for some 50 years by writing puffs on cheap ac-
tresses, and getting dinners from them. He
nearly made a fortune once by wedding a Hebrew
diamond merchant’s elderly ugly daughter, but
the lady’s neck was as thick as her waist, and her
waist was as thick as the megatherium, so
poor Lennox backed out. He got another show
when a German named Hirsch, who had been
cashier to Moses, the cheap tailor, started as
Baron Grant, and went into Parliament. This
tailei’s clerk floated bubble companies by the
score, and put Lord Henry’s name on the direc-
torate, and Lord Henry took it out in “ cham.”
and cigars ; but when he had drunk the one and
smoked the other the ex-pants-maker’s assistant
“ turned dog ”on him. When he was young,
L?nnox was one of a gay gang, among whom
Ballantine, Montague Williams, and others—one
of them is now in N.S.W. —were prominent. But
Billantine is dying somewhere on £L a week, if he
is not already dead ; Williams has been muti-
lated by the surgeons, and the rest of the party
are, most of them, in the New Jerusalem.
The Creamy Pony: A Story of the
Late Drought.
Did you ever see Peabody’s Charity Troupe 2 I
mean that company managed by Mrs. John Wood,
and sent by the great philanthropist from America
on a tour through Britain. In that trouble was a
girl called Louoy Henry. She had fair hair,
with black eyebrows and eyes. The effect was
charming.
Now just imagine her beauty multiplied by
“ x,” her hair so glorious that a sunbeam could
add naught to its lustre, a complexion like a
snowflake melting on a rosebud, but above all a
smile and laugh that would cure neuralgia. With
this combination you may have an idea of a simple
bush-girl who goes by the name of the Creamy
Pony.
But I, coming as a new-ohurn to Anneraw Station,
brought with me a little dun mare, and in Aus-
tralia they call that colour “ creamy.”
1 had not been a day in my new billet when I
was in shook, whatever you call it,
and Miss Cheval (the C.P.) was my flame.
I am not a new-chum now, and am a little
angry when I think how that girl humbugged me,
making me answer to the names, “Chummy,”
“ Jackeroo,” and even “ Face.”
I believe she was just beginning to like me,
when the infernal drought set in. I was sent
away first with sheep, then with the horses, and
then to look after some rented paddocks. When
there, I received a telegram from the manager,
“ Come and remove Creamy, or she will die.” (I
forgot to mention that I had left ray pony for my
darling to ride). I wondered why they took such
interest in a ten-pound nag. sol answered, “Can’t
help it, let her die. Back next month.” Now
the manager is first cousin to the (human) Creamy
Pony, so the next message was, “Dam Ass: be
back next week.” So I hastened back and found
my own mare well and sound at the Mail Change.
I AM soft: even then I never twigged the
message, but when in the verandah of the house
I saw a skeleton on a couch, playing with the
golden locks that had been shorn a week or two
before, (he truth slapped me in the face. Her
smile was the same, and strange to say she began
to amend, like that Color-Sergeant’s daughter in
the Judoean campaign.
Next week I shall go in double harness, and
(rain has set in) commence a struggle through the
black soil of this earth, heading for the paddocks
of hereafter, where, I doubt not, there is a grassy
corner for the “ Creamy Pony” and me.
HIRAM ABIFF.
A somewhat extraordinary occurrence,
which eventuated the other night at a certain
Lithgow hostelry, and in which the most pro-
minent actors were a candidate for Parliament, an
attractive young lady, and the landlord of a local
hotel, will probably not be without its effect upon
the ensuing contest for the representation of the
Lithgow constituency.

hotels are now closed at 10 p.m. and on Sunday,
but this does not seem to make people moral or
even to have a tendency that way, as suicides and

going ahead at Charters Towers (Q). “According
to law,” says the O'Kane, “ suicide is a crime be-
cause it tends to deprive her Majesty of a tax-
paying subject.” At Rockhampton (Q.) a man
has been locked up because he got raging drunk

An American paper says that the “ latest
freak of fashion at the seashore is for a belle to
make a present of her bathing costume to her
beau. He has it stuffed and mounted on a scarf-
pin.” “If there is a writer in the Chronicle

editorials,” remarks a ’Frisco editor The seven
great Powers of Europe are now said to bo France,
Russia, Prussia, Austria, Italy, England, and
Woman. And the greatest of these is woman
A letter from Italy to an American paper contains
this paragraph: “It seems to me that society
grows more puerile and vulgar every day. It has
no longer the witty epigram of the days of Horace
Walpole, nor the fine manners of the days of
Louis XV. I even heard to-day a young English
guardsman say that he thought the Prince of
Wales took money for going to Mrs. Mackay’s
house.” This is about as small an estimate of
royalty as has been made since the days of greedy
Louis XI It is calculated that if the muscles of
a man had the same proportionate strength as
those of a lien he could throw a bailiff two miles
and a quarter A packet of untouched bread 150
years old has been discovered in Hungary—and
yet they persist in calling the place Hungary.
Anyone 'who wants to invest in a block of
land in the rising city of Perth (W. A.) would do
well, it seems, to go and have a look at the pro-
perty before he purchases. According to an Auck-
land gentleman, who recently visited that howling
desert of dust, much of the land which isbeing offered
consists almost entirely of sand, scrub, and some-
thing that looks like pounded bricks, hut that is a
mere detail. Beeris handed round freely before an
auction takes place ; this stimulates bidding, and
makes the purchaser forger his agony when he
finds out what he has bought. The population is
only 10,000 or so, but the refuge contains no less
than 120 old paupers. Those of the population
who are sober arc not land-owners ; they know
better than that.
Tardy retribution has at last overtaken
Mrs. Taylor, the Melbourne “nurse.” For inad-
vertently assisting Julia Warburton to an early
grave, Mrs. T. must retire from business for two
years and devote herself to unremunerativq
labour. She won’t like it, neither will a lot of her
old friends and supporters. The absence of Mrs.
Taylor will cause a vacuum in Melbourne social
life —the sort of vacuum which giddy human’
nature abhors. There was profound silence in
court when Judge Holroyd passed sentence upenj
the demure-looking matron. A dropping of the]
proverbial pin would have caused quite a clatter.
And as she followed a ivarder to the consulting,
room a grey-haired old sinner murmured : “ What
arrangements am I to make for the next two years T
Poor old Mormon ! He looked so troubled in spirit
that we felt downright sorry for him.
It is about time'the British were clearing

put out the jug for the milk, and went off to enjo;
himaelf with the Soudanese barmaid round thj
corner. But hist as tbe benighted African wa
putting out tho jug the place was rushed by
Russian officer and a crowd of Albanians, wh|
shoved the paralysed nigger into the dust-hea
and took possession of the shanty without assign
ing any reason for their condufct. Presently th
British commandant heard what was going on am
ordered the Muscovite to clear, but the latter on!
danced an insane jig and asked if the Englishma

The Autophone is a wonderful little instrument
which, while it weighs less than three pounds has
the lungs of a full sized parlor organ, and executes
its music with absolute precision and perfect
effect. It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three
keys, and all the parts of most difficult music. On
it a child can correctly play, without instruction,
any of its music, which at present consists of ever
300 selections from hymns, oratorios, operas,
waltzes, polkas, marches, popular songs, &c. It
is best adapted to the kind of music which suits an
organ best, but also has wonderful power in exe-
cuting very lively pieces. £3T It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card holder for convenience
in singing. It is entirely well adapted for country
churches, Sunday schools, the family circle, and
also for dancing. The music is compact, and far
cheaper than that which is made for any organette.
The Autophone is like every other good thing, the
longer you have it the better you like it, and as
new music is being published every week it has an
endless fund of amusement in it.

CHAMBERS, CASTLEREAGH-ST., SYDNEY.
The Oriental Gold Co. having, after close
and long investigation, satisfied itself that the
Elgin is the best Watch in the world, and the
best value in all grades, has taken this line as a
specialty, and will henceforth handle no other
watch. This Company will post a sample Wateh
of any grade or price to any address in the
colonies on its usual liberal terms. A week’s trial
allowed. It not satisfied return the Watch un-
injured, and the money will bo restored, less
postages. Not many quotations can be given this
week, but no one can go wrong in seizing this
single chance.
In accordance with our promise we give a priced
list of Elgin Watches this week. We wish to re
mark, in the first place, that there is not a cheap-
jack Watch among them. The name of the Elgin
Company is on every one of the million watches
it has turned out, a direct guarantee and responsi-
bility.
US’Each Watch is an advertising agent for the
Company, A genuine good article at a reasonable
price.
Observe that we sell no silvercased Watch at a
less figure than Three Pounds. We can’t do it.
The movement, commonly called the works, is too
good to permit of it. If we were dealing in
Brummagem Watches, made in the West of
England, and sold to any dealer who chose to clap
his name on them, we could sell a sort of thing for
half the money, and the biggest part of the first
cost would be the silver of the case.
Remember, each and every Watch manufac-
tured by the Elgin Watch Co. is a Patent Lever,
with Compensating Balance. We sell no horizonta
or other inferior movements.
If Three Pounds is more than you can afford,
we meet you by reducing the price of the case —we
can’t and won’t sell you a debased movement.
The Elgin Company does not make such things.
Thus, then, our cheapest line, and we guarantee
it as good as any English Lever you can get any-
where for seven guineas, is ;
Gentleman’s Elgin Patent Lever Key-
winder with 7 jewels, patent
safety pinion compensating balance
in patent dust-band case of ore-
silver, crystal-plate open face £2 0 0
Gentleman’s ditto, ditto, in hunting
case £2 10 0

and controlled by ourselves exclusively. These
cases are, to all appearances and in wearing
qualities, the equal of silver.

The above is a faithful likeness of the man who
says that rheumatism is an invention of the devil.
He is a gentleman and a scholar ; speaks several
languages, and has got the biggest foot in Aus-
tralia.
Ho is very wealthy and good-looking; has
plenty of friends, but his clothes don’t fit him.
Ho has completely used up every pro p auc word
in the Colonial and other languages, still ho is not
happy.
He says there is enough thoroughbred agony
and hellish torture in his foot to kill every sinner
in creation.
He has been a Member of Parliament, a Minister
of the Crown, and an Alderman, hut does not re-
member having done anything to deserve his
sufferings.
He has always been devout; and at one period
of his life a government contractor.
He has tried all the doctors and nearly every-
thing under the sun, but the villain still pursues
him.
He tells everybody that trying to cure rheu-
matism is like trying to shovel wind off tho root.
Or trying to get a sinecure in tho Civil Service
without friends in the House, or marrying into a
high-toned family.
He says that rheumatism cannot he cured. Hi 3
grandfather told him so. And he thinks that
settles it.
He is sadly mistaken. It is a fact that a remedy
has been found which relieves and cures rheu-
matism, just as sure as the sun shines in the
heavens. It is used externally. It conquers pain-
It goes right to the spot. It cures when every
thing else has failed. It penetrates to the seat of
the disease. It is simple. It is safe. It is cer-
tain.
Mr. James Marlow, merchant tailor, ll.Flinders-
stroet East, Melbourne, was under medical treat-
ment for rheumatism fer months at a time, and
suffered severely both in health and packet. He
tried all sorts of remedies without obtaining relief,
until he got St. Jacobs oil, when “ the first appli-
cation gave me instant relief, and I am thankfid
to say that I have not experienced tho slightest
symptom of pain ever since.”
Edward Evans, formerly with Davey’and Moore-
London, was declared incurable at three hospitals.
He was nearly crazy from rheumatism. The
doctors said he must die. St. Jacobs Oil-cured
him. He says; “It saved my life.” William
Beach, champion oarsman of the world, writes :
“ I gladly endorse St. Jacobs Oil. It conquers
pain.”
Maurice D. Benjamin, Esq., importer and whole-
sale merchant, late of Brisbane, Queensland,
writes ;—“ I had my doubts at first of St. Jacobs
Oil eradicating rheumatism ; but as I have practi-
cally tested its efficacy, I can honestly state that
It has wonderful rheumatic healing qualities.”
Henry Ricketts, Westbury, Gloucestershire, was
pronounced incurable at Bath Hospital. His pains
were terrible. St. Jacobs Oil cured him. Afccr
practical tests on invalids in hospitals and else-
where, St. Jacobs Oil was awarded six gold medals
in America, Australia, and India. It has cured
people who had been crippled from pain for over
30 years.
William Gitschink, a stoker, belonging to
H.I.M.S. Albatross, was compelled to remain in
.Auckland when the Albatross sailed for Samoa,
on account of his dreadful sufferings from rheu-
matism. He says:—“l have now perfectly re-
covered, and it is entirely owing to the free appli-
cation of your wonderful remedy—St. Jacobs Oil.’
A CASH reward of £lOO will he paid by the
CHARLES A. VOGLER COMPANY, of BALTI-
MORE, MARYLAND, UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, proprietors of St, Jacobs Oil, or by
their accredited local representatives, to any per-
son producing proof to the effect that the testi-
monials published by them in regard to St. Jacobs
Oil are not strictly genuine.

HOUSED UP,
For the last three months a great many peor l-: have been
housed up, because they have not felt able to withstand Ihe
stormy wintry weather that has prevahed. But, unfortu-
nat ly, the confinement and the close a r of mod. rn houses
during the winter season is very enervating, and the system
needs help to enable all the organs to do their proper work.
If these ■ rgans have been inactive the consequences are
showing themselves in the bilious condition of the system,
or in cons.ipation of the bowels, or in disorders of the kid-
ne s, with oil the aches and pains that accompany these
complaints. If you are in this condition from any cause you

the latest statistics, being sent away in larger

has considerable attractions. Formerly the pur-
suit was attended with a certain amount of risk,
and the great distance from the station that a
doctor could be found necessarily increased the
danger when illness occured. The introduction of
Freeman’s Original Chlorodyne has dispelled this
alarm, as the sherp-farmers know this invaluable
remedy to be a compendious medicine chest in

F. M. Darley, Chief Justice.
With Mr. Barley's acceptance of the Chief
Justiceship of New South Wales, a not very
creditable chapter in the judicial records of the
colony is brought to a close. It is not worth
while to review the letter in which Mr. Salomons
states his reason for after all declining to
accept the position. This letter is certainly
lacking m force and manliness, but it must
be remembered in the writer’s favor that he was
unable to reveal the real incentive to his decision.
It was not, as is well known, the neglect of one
judge to leave a card, or the studied neglect of
another, but the open and flagrant insult to which
he was subjected, that forced his resignation, and
this latter affront it is not possible to disclose in
the written explanation. All the slights described
at * e< * lous length in Mr. Salomons’ letter would
not have availed to make him renounce the
coveted office, but even if none of these had
occurred the unmentioned insult would still have
from the Bench. It is unfortunate
Mr. Salomons that the public judgment on his
conduct must be passed in the absence of the im-
portant evidence which cannot now be disclosed,
fne only satisfactory consequence of Mr. Salo-
mons retirement is the acceptance of office by
Mr. Barley. A high reputation in the Legislative
Council and at the bar alike give solid promise of
his performances as Chief Justice, and although it
is p°Bs ible to wish that ho had previously ox-
„** L if ec ! ® breadth equal to his undoubted
mental depth, it is more seemly to hope that the
eirors which have sometimes tarnished his re-
nown will be laid aside with the wig and gown of
It is an open secret that Mr. Dailey would
have accepted the N.S.W. Chief Justiceship had
the Cabinet been unanimous in selecting him.
Ur. Henwick, however, went so far as to wr
out his resignation and to declare by all that w
holy that he would not withdraw it if the P.
accepted the position; and Mr. Suttor al
threatened to secede from the Government in t
event of the King of Manly Beach sitting down
the chair of the late Sir James Martin—for,
dared the Postmaster-General, the elevation

Our dear old friend, Pastor Allen, o;'
Sydney, once more treats us to a newspape
lecture on “ unfermented wine.” Let the office
minstrel sing;—
The famous Pastor Allen
When he’s preaching to the fallen,
Oft describes from Bible history the many kind
of wine.
And he thinks the “ booze ” in ferment
Is the cause of much interment,
And brings down human beings to the level of the
swine.
But when on that subject risky,
He will ne’er allude to whisky ,
And he mentions not the evils that result from
foaming beer,
He, perchance, may love a sleever
When it’s served by gay deceiver,
Who with smiles accepts his threepence and
addresses him as “ Dear.”
Margaret Hodge, of Little Oxford-street,
Sydney, seems to be the champion cat-swallower
of the Land of the Kangaroo. For a long time
past her dwelling has given of! an odour like a
cartload of skunks, a hundred damp umbrellas,
and a choice assortment of drains, dead dogs’
bailiffs, stale tobacco, Chinamen, and larrikins,
while over all has arisen a subtle, ethereal essence
which suggested an unburied elephant. This
ultimately led an inspector to examine the flesh-
pots inside, and he found the occupant of the
house gloating over a “high” old cat on which
she was about to dine, while the yard was paved
with the bones of other pussies ; rats also held a
place in the bill of fare, and anything that was so
obtrusively deceased as to yell with a thousand
tongues for burial, and yet not so hopelessly dead
as to fall to pieces when elevated by the tail,
seems to have served for an entree or a side-dish.’
The magistrate presented Margaret with an in-
voice for £6 and costs.

By not heeding the warnings of Nature, many persons
are laid up on a bed of sickness and suffering for v eeke,
months U or years. There is hardly a disease that
attacks the system which is not preceded by symptoms.
Let these symptoms be attended to and the disease
will be nipped in the bud. Note the following .
KIDNEY

/ Pain in Small of Back, Pain in
Loins, Flushes of Heat and Chills,
with Disordered Stomach, Bowels,
Headache, Weakness, &c. In fact,
Kidney Complaint appears in so
many different ways, it is im-
possible to name them all.
Dr. Bell’s Bitters has cured some

Any one of the above symptoms is not sufficient to
cause any alarm, and many persons do not payiuiy

firmly established itself in the system.
