The large sale for “EUMENTHOL JU*

being manufactured under the name of men-
thol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure and get
HUDSON’S EUMENTHOL JUJUBES. You
may be asked to buy other jujubes, and be
told they are “just as good” as Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes. This proves that these
imitations and substitutes have no reputa-
tion of their own, and can only be sold on the
good repute and high character of Hudson's
Eumenthol Jujubes.

Modernities
After all, the prime function of a critic
is to criticise liis own age. His duty is to
assess the forces operating around him, to
sum the meaning of the personalities of his
own time, and thus make clear to his age .
its tendencies and its message. So, crea-
tively, he may indicate the trend of civilisa-
tion into the future. Yet there are hosts
of critics who spend their time criticising ,
the past, turning bleared to the modern
glow about them. It was the duty of those
past ages to criticise themselves; more use-
ful than any learned discussion of the past
are the diaries of critics who actually lived
in the past. One 'Pepys is worth a hundred
contributors to the Sliakebacon controversy.
A welcome, then, for two critics who do not
disdain to criticise what they have the best
means of knowing, their own age and its
tendencies. Modernities, by Horace B.
Samuel (Kegan Paul, per Sydney Book
Club), and Voices of To-morrow, by Edwin
Bjorkman (Kennerley, N.Y.) have vital in-
terest. Among the moderns Samuel dis-
cusses Strindberg, Nietzsche, Wedekind,
Schnitzler, Yerhaeren, “The Future of
Futurism” and—-Corelli! The latter
“modernity” is, however, treated in a deli-
cious vein of gravity, lightened with
touches like this :—
We may conclude this portion of our com-
parative analysis by suggesting for the erotic
crest of Mrs. Elinor Glyn a Debrett and an
Almanach de Gotha enveloped in a silk and
scented “nightie”; for that of Miss Marie
Corelli, a volume of the Self-and-Sex series
lying open between a doffed domino and a
crinoline.
Bjorkman’s modernities include Strind-
berg, Bjornson, Selma Lagerlof, Grierson,
Edith Wharton, Maeterlinck, Bergson,
Gissing, Conrad and Robert Herrick.
Strindberg is the subject of a brilliant
analysis by both critics. Samuel has this
of him to say : —
Throughout his life the persecution mania
of Strindberg expressed itself in his attitude
to sex, religion and society, as like at once
some veritable Rhadamantliine recorder, and
some cowering victim of Divine ven-
geance, he dispenses and fears those words
of doom in his black adamant of diction. Yet
it is impossible casually to brush the man
aside as some mere paranoiac. The very
torments of his soul fructified in the stupen-
dous genius of his intellectual production.
With all his perversities, with all his aber-
rations, Strindberg remains the blackest,
and in his own particular sphere, the most
drastic, intelligence in the whole of our
European literature.
Bjorkman says:—
As we see the real man Strindberg, with
his life cleared of foolish legends and hostile
interpretations, he was neither an ogre nor
a sphinx, but, on the whole, a very simple
human being. At heart he was an incur-
able sentimentalist —and like all true senti-
mentalists he was, on the surface, all con-
tradiction, all conflict, all vain struggle to
reach a point of equilibrium where the mil-
lion paradoxes of life should become resolved
into a single absolute truth. ...In trying to
fathom and estimate the spirit of Strindberg,
let us always bear in mind the indubitable
sincerity and tremendous earnestness which
stamped all he did and said as with a seal
of fire. lie was one of those rare few who
always meant what he said, and who meant
it with all there was in him of emotional
and intellectual power.... His themes
gripped deeply and strongly into life as
actually lived. He was always dealing with
things that matter, and most with things
that matter vastly.... In more respects
than one he was comparable to one of
those loud-voiced and sharp-tongued old
Hebrew prophets, whose temper and lan-
guage he seemed ro share in equal degree.
Once he was named the artistic conscience
of his own country. But as I see him, he
shared with Ibsen and Tolstoy the soul-
saddening task of being the spiritual con-
science of the entire period to which he
belonged.
The phenomenon of Wedekind, the Ger-
man dramatist of the almost unmentionable,
Samuel accounts for by the character of his
audience.
Wedekind’s audience is the extreme left
wing. The German left wing, however, is
considerably more numerous, more ad-
vanced and more dangerous than the Eng-
lish. Our own {esthetic movement was
killed almost instantaneously by the Wilde
debacle. We still, of course, have our ultra-
modern movement, such as it is; but for
practical purposes no one could be more
amiable or innocuous than the ladies and
gentlemen who used to constitute the highly
respectable audiences of the Court Theatre,
or who find in . the Stage Society a mildly
audacious means of spending their Sabbath
evenings. Germany, however, with its
vastly superior education, and its horde of
professional men and women, schoolmasters
and piano-mistresses, lawyers, doctors, poets
and litterateurs, has the disease of moder-
nity with a vengeance,. carrying through
each symptom to its logical conclusion with
a violence and intensity to which our own
fluttering unconventionalism affords but the
faintest and most shadowy parallel. Free-
love, which, with the possible exception of a
certain ephemeral incident successfully im-
mortalised in three or four recent novels, is
in England little more than a name is
in Germany a theoretic dogma almost as
sacred as that of woman suffrage and de-
manding almost as devout sacrifices on the
shrine of its philosophic altar.... How
strong is the neo-aesthetic movement may
be gauged by the phenomenal success in Ber-
lin of Salome and Monna Vanna, the great
scenes of which were followed avidly by
young girls with an enthusiasm which
•was more than aesthetic. It may be men-
tioned incidentally that Wilde’s De Pro-
fundis was published in German before it
appeared in England.... As Baudelaire in
verse, and Beardsley in painting, found their
theme in the vicious and the abhorrent, so
does Wedekind in the drama.
d*
Of Sclmitzler, the Viennese dramatist,
Samuel says:—
It is true that the ethics of these plays,
with their chronic and inevitable intrigues,
may strike the English mind as somewhat
unusual; yet Sclmitzler enjoys the reputa-
tion of being the most brilliant and accurate
portrayer of Contemporary Viennese life. . . .
Vienna stands intellectually nearer to Paris
than to Berlin, so that the Teutonic intro-
spection and sentimentalism are touched
with Gallic sprightliness and a Gallic grace.
No dramatist has written tragedy with so
light a hand, or comedy with so ironically
pathetic a smile, as has Arthur Sclmitzler.
Emile Verhaeren, the Belgian poet,
Samuel terms, “a man who both in thought
and in technique is indisputably the most
modei’n and the most massive force in the
whole of contemporary European poetry.”
He is the singer of the whole fulness of
modern European life as a whole, with its
clashes, its complexities, its agonies and
tensions, its deserted country-sides and its
pullulating metropoles, its armaments and
its Armageddons, its brothels, cathedrals,
laboratories and Stock Exchanges, its
sciences and its sensualities, its arts, philo-
sophies and aspirations.
Continuing in this hyperbolical mood, Sam-
uel ' asserts that Verhaeren’s muse “suckles
the superman of the future on her universal
breasts.” One can see that Verhaeren’s muse
will thus be kept pretty busy. Samuel’s
appreciation, however, though couched in such
a superlative strain, is stimulating and pro-
vocative. A final essay on “The Future of
Futurism” is brilliantly done. Both books
are valuable for the reader’s orientation.

The Australian University, Deed.
The Australian University is as dead as a
museum ; it is a place where a harassed pro-
fessoi.; usually of dead languages or decayed
history, lectures, corrects examination papers
and answers letters, without the assistance
e W n °I a stenographer, and never thinks an
original thought or comes into contact for

outs .^ e 118 class-rooms. Indeed the usual
moribund professor rather pndes himself
upt J n his impracticability. He is content to
l jursue knowledge for its own sake, as if
knowledge were any use unless applied to the
practical problems of todays life. It is a
commonplace of comment that from these
scholastic tombs no help comes to assist in
living the pressing problems of this our
Manufacture modern 6
«<x*s **&m in « Modern Vnilrsity
(Angus and Itobertson, Sydney, Is.), R. F.
Irvifie, Professor of Economics at Sydney
«° SgJJ Sh“ ItlTtheTeie ' a
matter of fact, British Universities have not
been stagnant 5 the y alter slowly, it is true...
but remarkable progress has been made. Some
of the more c< J t deve i o p ments , like the
establishment of Schools of Commerce at Ox-
ford and o am bridge, and the Oxford move-
ment for the education of working men, seem
revolutionary, and, indeed, incomprehensible
to many of our ‘stand-patters.’ The fact is
that men of conservative temperament in
Australia are less progressive than men of
their own class both in Europe and America.
Their comparative isolation, the dearth of
competent discussion of the fundamentals of
social and educational progress, and their
dread of the venturesome policies of demo-
cratic governments, have combined to make
them reactionaries.”
In his plea for better business methods in
our universities, and specially for the estab-
lishment of a statistical bureau for the de-
partment of Sociology, where the latest in-
formation on all social subjects will be
classified and readily available to students,
business men, newspapers, politicians and
even aldermen, R. F. Irvine says: “We have
the reputation of being the social laboratory
of the w0r1d....1 am not sure that we are
entitled to so much credit on that score. Our
experimentation seems to me less due to
energy of creative thought than to a certain
sporting courage in adopting ideas that
other countries have hesitated to act upon,
and to the general weakening—perhaps a
fortunate weakening—in Australia of some
of the traditional forces of social control,
Certainly the fact that governments have
done little and universities nothing at all, to
test experiments by accurate investigation, is
fairly strong evidence that our policies have
been of the hit-or-miss kind. Nothing strikes
visiting economists and sociologists so much
as the meagreness of investigation and criti-
cism by Australians of their own social evo-
lution. The admitted excellence of our
Statistical Bureaux cannot remove this dis-
grace.”
The book is a lucid exposition of the
meaning and scope of a human Sociology
and a forcible plea for the recognition ot
the paramount importance of this. science in
our dead museums of classic tdryism. It is
free from the drab academic touch; it is the
sane expression of a sane socialism. Evi-
dently this challenge is going to rattle the
dry bones of our intellectual vaults. luci-
dentallv, there is this useful definition ot
“capital”: “Capital may be used for any
purpose, good or bad. It is simply the in-
strument, not necessarily material, of pri-
vate gain: anything, in fact, which can be
used to achieve individual profits. It may
consist of lands, machines, railways, bur-
glars’ jemmies, patents, privileges, monopo-
lies, advertising, lying, bribery or stealing.
It is evident that if capital is really leav-
ing the country, it must look rather like an
eight-hour procession.
Macarthur the Magnificent
Not history, but the material for history,
is the fine volume, Some Early Records of
the Macarthurs of Camden, edited by Sibella
Macarthur Onslow, by Angus
and Robertson, Sydney (155.). This
is no biography of the fiery gentleman who,
oddly enough, became a farmer, and
whose acumen and perseverance meant
so much for the destiny of this con-
tinent. The book is merely a faithful and
full record of Macarthur’s life and life-inter-
est, the founding of the wool industry here.
There is little narrative in the volume; the
history of the wool industry is told by means
of letters and documents literally reproduced,
with only such comments as enable us to
interpret them. The book is really a huge
bundle of letters —and, in those days of rare
and uncertain communications, letters ran
to an extraordinary length. As a picture of
the early days these letters are remarkably
vivid and occasionally quaint; and from them
emerges the dominating figure of Macarthur,
a living portrait.
Evidently a difficult man, quick in a
quarrel, fighting a duel even on his first
voyage out, and another in Australia, having
trouble with his ship-captain, easily “angered
to an extreme degree,” apt to look for in-
sults, a bitter and pertinacious enemy, lack-
ing the tact that would have made a friend
of Joseph Banks, and fatally meeting in
Bligh a man of his own quick temper. That
w r as one side of this remarkable man. The
other concerned Australia. His high belief
in her future, his incessant labors to perfect
the breeding of the finest wool in the world,
his care and expertness in his chosen busi-
ness—that is the Macarthur that mattered.
True, he took care to enrich himself in en-
riching Australia; and one gets the impres-
sion that this was his chief design. But he
would not have wanted to pose as a patriotic
altruist; he was a business man who saw
ahead the rich rewards of his high business
acumen, and he meant to get them. He was
no democrat; his visions of the future, em-
bodied in his suggestions to the British Gov-
ernment, provided for an aristocracy of
wealthy settlors, maintaining hordes of ser-
vants and laborers, with as many convicts
as possible. There was no other way, he
Contended, to check the rise of democracy.
“This democratic feeling has already taken
deep root in the Colony, in consequence of
the absurd and mischievous policy pursued
by Governor Macquarie—and as there is
already a strong combination amongst that
class of persons, it cannot be too soon op-
posed with vigor.” What a Federal Fusion
Prime Minister he would have made!
Kissa
J. Macmillan Brown’s work on the anthro-
pology of the Pacific, notably his discovery
of the white, or Caucasian, origin of the
Polynesian, has not been properly appre-
ciated by scientists overseas. In The Dutch
East (Kegan Paul, per Dymock’s _ Library),
he fills in minor details of his big theory.
But this book is less a thesis than a record
—a record of a much neglected but to us a
highly important part of the world. And
he has many interesting things to tell. We
usually think of the Dutch North as crammed
with population. Yet most of it is in Java.
The 30,000,000 Javanese, though confined to
one-fifteenth of the area of the whole archi-
pelago, comprise above 80 per cent, of its
inhabitants. We learn of Great Sanguir,
the most closely-peopled region in the world,
a mountainous island but 25 miles in length,
with a population of 70.000 —-all persons of
independent means. Nobody need work.
There are millions of cocoanut palms on the
island, and three will support a family for
a year. If it were not for their Dutch
masters, who insist on the natives working
on the roads and plantations, the race would
soon perish of laziness. The lesson for Aus-
tralia is obvious.
“Copra is going to be the steady basis of
tropical prosperity. It needs little labor
and practically no skilled labor, and its high
price is assured; the Commonwealth labor
laws will not greatly affect it, as they will
rubber. For the tropical and humid belt of
the Northern Territory there is no wealth-
maker like the cocoanut; cattle will do all
the labor of keeping the plantations clean,
and will not injure the trees or their pro-
duct ; and with copra at £24 a ton a few
dozen trees should support a European
household comfortably, and a few dozen more
would send them all down in the hot summer
to Sydney or Melbourne, whilst one re-
mained to look after the plantation.” Let’s
all go cocoanut farming in the Territory!
But we are forgetting the grim lesson of
Kissa.
The author tells us, too, of the romance of
the great pirate empires of the past in this
corner of the world, and of their inglorious
end by means of the steam launch. In
Celebes it is only four years since the last
pirate-empire was shattered. But the out-
standing fact about this region so close to
us is the sparsity of the population, exclud-
ing Java. There are and even groups
of islands that have not a single human be-
ing on them: And the evidence of the un-
touched forest shows that the population
was never other than sparse, from one to
the square mile to one to the ten square
miles. The pirates are responsible for these
solitudes, the pirates and—sago. For the
sago palm is more prolific than the cocoanut.
No man need work more than a week per
year to keep himself and his family. In
older times the race kept itself fit by the
sport of head-hunting; but now that that
gentle excitement is taken from them, and
there is nobody to give them regular em-
ployment as slaves, they just sit down to
their sago and commit race suicide. Had
sago grown in temperate zone Europe and
Asia and Africa, the author’s irresistible
conclusion is that there would have been no
history: we should have all remained Papu-
ans, ‘‘occupants of paradise, without any
need of work, without ambition or thought,
without figleaf, and without happiness ex-
cept from the sugar-palm distillery” and
the gentle game of head-hunting. And all
that we need do now to reach that happy
state is to find a hybrid of the sago-palm
that will stand the frost. The prospect is
tempting.
But we should consider the moral of Ivissa.
The lesson that hard work is necessary to
save the race from extinction _ in the
tropics comes from this little island of
Kissa, a raised atoll near Timor. There a
pure Dutch colony has persisted and kept
even its blue eyes and fair hair for 200
years. In 1665 eight Dutch soldiers were
landed on this lonely islet by the Company
to man its fort, and were promptly forgotten.
But their wives were with them —and there
were no sago palms. They had to work
hard—that is the sole reason of their tri-
umphant survival and extraordinary
Though many have left, there is now a popu-
lation of 300 in the village. These Dutch-
men know no Dutch, they are as dark as
Italians, but they have retained their re-
ligion and their fertility, despite some neces-
sary cross-breeding.
“The significance of this accidental experi-
ment in acclimatisation is of great import-
ance for Australia; she has her Northern
Territory to people, and it has long been a
question whether the white race can per-
manently people it. Yet here is a laboratory
experiment right at the doors of tropical
Australia. For 250 years 16 Europeans and
their posterity have maintained themselves
without leaving their tropical islet, and with-
out degeneration, except from too close inter-
marriage.... The experiment indicates that
it is nut the heat or ultra-violet sunrays of
the tropics that make a white race unstable
and ultimately evanescent. It is some other
condition which did not affect these Dutch.
Perhaps it is the helplessness that too many
servants induce in men and women. Per-
haps it is the tendency in the great heat ot
summer to indolence and luxury. .. .It looks
as if work and a hard life are two of the
essential conditions of race-permanence and
race progress in the tropics, as in the tem-
perate zones. There must be scope for the
working of the law of the survival of the
fittest, and nothing must take the edge off
it.... Had these Dutch soldiers been left m
one of the rich sago islands we should never
have heard of them again; they would have
sunk into indolence and luxury, into sago
and sagueir, and would have died out except
in the blood of the decreasing naked dark
skins. The lesson for Australia is that it
is not the heat of the tropics that will
annihilate the white race in the N.T., but the
inertia of human nature that heat develops
and increases In the tropics, heat, chiefly
moist heat, is on the side of luxury and idle-
ness. The dry heat of the Australian pla-
teau, whether tropical or sub-tropical, in-
terferes little with the vitality and energy
that make life a healthy pleasure. It is the
moist heat of the tropical coasts, with their
malaria and malaria-carrying pests, that
swells the tissues and _ makes them the
natural seed-beds of inertia and disease. As
long as human life keeps to the plateaux in
tropical Australia and is bred in moderately
hard conditions it will not cease to perpetuate
itself in a vigorous posterity. That is the
lesson from Kissa.”

CARTRIDGES
The time of all others when reli-
able cartridges are invaluable is
in big-game hunting. A miss-fire,
an inaccurate cartridge, or one
having poor- penetration may
mean the loss of a coveted trophy
or even injury to the hunter.
Winchester —the W brand —of
big-game cartridges, either smoke-
less or black powder, can always
be relied on to be sure fire, accur-
ate and to have the proper speed
and penetration. You can help

When You Don’t Feel Well.
If you are not feeling well; if you are run down ;
out-of-sorts, have a sickly taste in your mouth,
a sallow skin, headache, no appetite and no
energy, you know there is something wrong with
your system, yet perhaps you hardly feel ill
enough to call in the Doctor. But certainly
something must be done to correct the sluggish-
ness of your liver and tone up your digestion,
and for this purpose you will find an excellent
remedy in

Dr. Cockle introduced his Antibilious Pills

household word, for Cockle’s Pills are

THIN WOMEN!
Would You
Like a Well Developed
and Well Proportioned
FIGURE?
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the one essential
that creates a perfect appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow
cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from a woman the bloom and fresh-
ness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in so far
as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct
your deficiency. Kvcn though you have never been full-bosomed, and have
been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from no wasting disease, your
bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased to normal....
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, fiat-bosomed,
hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and suffering the effects of
antenna and defective digestion, who are now for the first time in their lives
healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and rcn.joying the full vigor of robust
womanhood, as the result of a few weeks under our wonderful
DR. FALLIERE’S FRESH-FOOD.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is, beyond question, and its use is
no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a week, and an
increase in bust measurement up to eight or ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers relief
and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who have despaired of ever possessing
a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that adds weight and permanent
development to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF LETTERS DIKE THIS:
Manager “Flesh-Food” Co.. Cympie, Queensland, May 5, 1913.
Dear Sir,—As a nurse, I was very interested in your Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly
surprised at the wonderful results in my case. When I first wrote to you I was only skin and
bone, and I have good cause to be thankful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I feel certain
now that I am one of the very best advertisements you could possibly have, as I am developed in
every way satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a good while to prove if it was lasting in
its effect, and I am now glad to say that your splendid treatment has done absolutely all you
claimed it would, my weight and measurements being ample.—l am, yours gratefully,
Mrs. E. Wingrove.

The Leaders.
Never since federation was Liberalism better
equipped for battle than it is to-day. The forces
are efficient and politically well-trained. Their
leaders are strong and courageous men, tried and
found trustworthy, and eager to fight for principle.
—Argus.
The fine, efficient men march in
Who turned the Labor guys out —
Thesounding Watt, the tinkling Glynn
Who’s read his soul’s two eyes out;
Observe the Cook that lards the hog,
And Forrest faintly looming,
Like some spent airship in a fog;
And Irvine squatting on a log,
A sort of legislative frog
Within a cavern booming.
Great leaders tied to apron strings
Of any social Molly
Who dribbles round the mazy rings
Of economic folly,
They lead old Fat Man true and fair,
As props and stays lead houses.
The job is easy. Fat, I swear,
Is never going anywhere,
But sunk within his cushioned chair
He sits and eats and drowses.
Lead standing still, ye warriors brave,
All well-equipped for battle!
Your way is downward to the grave,
r Your war-cry Death’s dry rattle.
Your owners well may fume and fret,
They find the people proving
How well their enemies are met
In this self-seeking Tory set
That stons at; nothing, and is yet
Incapable of moving!
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.
Verses of Winter.
Orverse.
Cycles of splendor, making each a ring
About Cod’s finger, roll the glorious days !
The tingling morning, the soft, golden noon,
The crystal evening’s faint, illusive haze,
And then the fixed, wan glamor of the moon
When the white stillness seems a brittle thing.
Reverse.
A general sense of sloppiness and grime,
With rain, or icy wind, or frost, or sleet,
And bleak deficiency of warmth and light.
Oceans of mud in every draughty street;
Wet clothes and boots about the fire at night,
And chilblains on the faltering feet of Time.
VICTORIA.

The Wolf of Greed.
If you'll but quit your fireside thoughts,
And come along wi’ me,
All in the middle of the night
A wonder you shall see.
With cloak and cap against the cold,
And lighting back our fears,
We’ll search the dark with dreading eyes,
Like ’wildered mariners.
For we shall see the cold, white stars
That gleam and gleam alway,
Above that Xetlier World that knows
No blessfid break of day.
And we shall see the man-shaped things
That grope in darkness there,
And feel the wind that blows from out
The realm of dark Despair.
And we shall see gaunt forms that reel,
And sink in silent strife.
(Who hath not seen them hath not plumbed
The sunless deeps of life!)
And through the marrow of our'bones—
Slow moving, stealing slow —
Shall creep a sense of utter loss,
Irrevocable woe.
Dark eyes, deep set with sunken fires,
Shall front us on our path,
And tense, drawn lips made pale by pain,
And thunder-brows of wrath.
Perchance we shall behold that Wolf
Who came with ravening jaws,
When first man crowned Undying Self
The lord of all his laws.
A huntsman not in scarlet clad,
Nor yet in funeral black,.
Hides, horn to mouth, with glowing heart
Forever on his track.
M hat time the age-old chase goes by
The leaden winds are mute ;
The grey Wolf stretched in utmost flight,
The Huntsman in pursuit.
That Wolf! When men and women crouch
Gnawed through with hunger-pangs,
And callous Wealth goes careless by—
We see his flashing fangs.
That Huntsman! When a deed is done
That lifts the human race.
Some starry sacrifice of self —-
W e see his glowing face.
“Halloo! Halloo!” Through all the years
The cry goes down the wind —
The grey Wolf flying fast before,
The Huntsman fast behind.
“Halloo ! Halloo!” through all the years
That made the heartless Past,
The grey Wolf fled across the world,
The Huntsman followed fast.
“Halloo ! Halloo!” the cry shall ring
Till fairer times have birth.
And in the dawn of larger love
The Wolf is run to earth.
Then shall the Huntsman, glorious-eyed.
His foot upon the prey,
With horn-notes flung across the world,
Salute the break of day.

LATEST NEWS OF THE UNEM-
PLOYED.
Onk day last week —a pleasant winter day,
when the sky was blue and the sea was calm
and also blue, and the beaches were long and
yellow, and the hills behind the fair city of
Adelaide were clothed in green, and the
world seemed a good place to live in—on
exactly that kind of day a large deputation
waited on the S. Australian Commissioner
for Public Works. It said, doubtless on good
authority, that there were 000 or 100 men
out of work in Adelaide, and that they and
their families were threatened with starva-
tion. The deputationists were dressed, to a
very considerable extent, in imported
clothes, and imported hats, and im-
ported boots, and imported shirts, and
imported under-clobber, and in many cases
the imported boots were moored to the
owner's feet with imported bootlaces. Also,
those of the men who had watches carried
imported watches. They were out of work
because all the employment involved in the
making of those boots and clothes and hats
and sundries went abroad. They were extra
poor because they were heavily taxed to pay
interest on loans floated to liquidate the bill
for foreign goods, and these loans being for-
eign, like the watches and the bootlaces, the
interest went abroad and was no longer
available to supply Avages in S. Australia.
Their condition was not cheerful, and the
Commissioner looked upon them with a
kind and brotherly eye. lie expressed his
intention to push on the foreign borrowing
policy so that they Avould be taxed more
heavily in order to pay more interest. He
promised to infuse new energy into public
works by means of imported money in order
to furnish temporary relief. And if the
works don’t pay for axle-grease because there
aren’t enough local tailors and bootmakers
and Avatehmakers and so on to use them,
the deputationists will have to be
super-taxed to make good the short-
age. But the Commissioner didn’t tell the
herd of applicants to go aAvay and vote like
the very devil for high Protection, and higher
Protection, and the very highest Protection,
so that there might be billets immediately for
20.000 men in making goods that are iioav
imported, and 0 would be no longer neces-
sary to float a foreign loan every feAv months
to pay for imports, and thus pile three or
four new interest bills per annum on the
shoulders of the jobless multitude. Plain,
savage, honest logic of that sort isn't in
fhe equipment of a Commissioner of Public
Works. He takes the primrose way and the
line of least resistance, and speaks softly
lest lie should lose his salary and his revolv-
ing otfice-cliair and liis roll-top desk.
Many years ago the original State Labor
party of N.S.W., which was the father of
all the present Labor parties, decided to sink
the fiscal issue in order to improve its
chance of securing office. In those days,
however, N.S.W. was importing less than
half the amount it imports now; and was
spending less than half as much, and borrow-
ing in most years about a quarter as much.
Aud Australia in general was importing less
than half the amount it impprts now, and it
was exporting enough to pay for its imports
and also to pay a very fair proportion of
the interest on its public and private foreign
liabilities. In some years it even reduced
its foreign liabilities. The sinking of the
fiscal issue wasn’t an act of absolute mad-
ness in 1893. nor in 1900, nor even in 1910.
With the commercial lunacy which came to
pass in 19.11 and 1912 and 1913 the sinking
business became impossible unless this coun-
try is to end by repudiating its debts. The
continuous and unprecedented growth in local
wages without any corresponding increase in
the tariff or in foreign wages puts the local
manufacturer at a steadily increasing disad-
vantage. Nowadays Australia floats its lOU
abroad for not only the whole amount re-
quired to pay interest on its immense foreign
debts, thereby adding the interest to the prin-
cipal, but it borrows part of the money to
pay for its imported watch-chains and
bloater paste and hats and cigars and drinks
and braces and pants and women’s frills and
theatrical posters and drapers’ catalogues
and a thousand sundries. Three results arise
in natural succession from this policy : First
comes a taste for luxury—not wild or rabid
luxury, but more luxury than the earnings
of the community can pay for. Next comes
an increase of taxation because Bull-Cohen
doesn’t lend as a matter of pure philan-
thropy. Third comes the cry of the heavily-
taxed unemployed, who are unemployed
because the goods they ought to be making are
made abroad, and are heavily-taxed because
of the country’s embarrassments. The posi-
tion seems obvious enough, yet because of the
fiscal-sinking craze the S.A. Commissioner
for Public Works —who is not a very bril-
liant or resourceful man in any case—has
nothing to propose except that he should
plod along the old thriftless track, and set
printers, tailors, actors, artists, bootmakers,
ironfounders, shipbuilders and the like at
building the unpayable railway from Smith’s
Curse to Jones’s Ruins.
* * * *
A certain inter-State Commission sits
patiently at a large salary and takes evidence
as to how an increase of the tariff would
affect Mizzle, ' who deals in curling-pins
and cheap brooches; and how a reduction
would influence the trade of Chizzle, who-
trades in back-hair and smoked glasses for
the observation of solar eclipses; aud what
consequence a continuation of the present
duties would have on Drizzle and his busi-
ness in Huckleberry pianos and boots
that have been struck by lightning. All these
small matters are very interesting as applied
to th(> petty concerns of Mizzle and Chizzle;
and Drizzle. But two witnesses have not
been called, and apparently never will be
called. One is- the unemployed—lie would
have to be heard in the Sydney Domain or
on the Adelaide Park Lands —who can’t get
a job because the goods he ought to be mak-
ing are made by foreigners. The other is
(he general taxpayer—his evidence would
have to be heard in one of the wide spaces
of the Northern Territory—-whose burdens
grow more weighty every year by reason of
the interest on the foreign loan that is
always being put on the market to pay for
the imported goods. The Bulletin doesn’t
profess that Protection is a virtue or gospel
in itself. It; is merely a device which is re-
quired to meet certain conditions —unless
some better device can be found. The points
at issue are that Australia is, in proportion
to population, the most pawned country on
earth. It imports more in proportion to
population than any other country on earth.
It imports so much more than it can afford
to pay for that it is borrowing at the rate
of some £18,000,000 a year. It seems likely
to borrow even more than that very soon.
As a set-off to all these griefs it is the
most thinly-peopled (and consequently the
worst-defended) white man’s country on
earth. As a natural consequence, it can offer
each agricultural or pastoral inhabitant more
land than any other country ; and, as a side
issue, it is a great producer of the precious
metals.' Yet it can’t provide work for any
large number of immigrants; it can merely
hand to them, on landing, their respective
shares of the wonderful Debt. Nor, at times,
can it find sufficient work for its own hand-
ful of inhabitants. The bottom threatens to
fall out of the country by reason of more im-
ports than it can pay for, more three-ball
finance than it can ever hope to carry unless
it reforms, and a superabundance of folk
hanging round the labor bureaux looking for
the job that has been bestowed on somebody
in Europe. If anybody can propound a
better remedy for these evils than high Pro-
tection, The Bulletin will gladly hear of
it. It doesn’t care 2d. for high Protection,
save as a means—the best means at present
in sight—to an end. Supposing Unitarian-
iam will enable this country to pay its way
out of its own earnings and regularly cut a
fragment off the great aggregate pawnticket,
TTiitarianism will suit this paper just as
well. So. for that matter, will Mormon ism.
* * -X-
The rich, fat Tory press, which lives
largely on importers’ advertisements, is busy
these days warning the community against
‘A ictorians” and other ill-regulated people
who seek to make Protection an issue at the
coming Federal election. They point out
that the Labor party dropped the fiscal pro-
blem long ago, and that the Deakin-Cook
Fusion did the same in later times. It
might be added with equal force that a cer-
tain King of Scotland dropped over a pre-
cipice in the thirteen*h century. Alfred
Deakin is out of politics, and Cook never
amounted to much in politics, and of the
original fiscal-sinking Laborites most have
vanished. Nobody gave the old. dry bones
of these bygone folk any authority to pledge
flic Australian nation for all time. Cireum-
stances have altered, just as commerce
altered when the railway arrived and the
bullock-dray fell into the background—also
just as the Sydney Telegraph altered when
the new editor arrived. Local wages have
risen by fully 20 per cent, since Deakin
and Cook made their famous agreement,
after the manner of Decimus Barnacle
and Tudor Stiltstalking ; and local
wages are as much a part of the fiscal issue
as duties against foreign goods, so the tariff-
sinking arrangement broke into many pieces
very long ago. The country which not only
paid its way but reduced its foreign debt
between 1902 and 1910 is now piling up more
foreign debt in one year than it is likely to
get rid of in a century. Even if the departed
Deakin and the inefficient Cook had made
a hundred agreements instead of one, and
even if the original Australian Labor party
of the early 90’s in last century had buried
the tariff problem to the bottom of the sea
with an anchor and a dead whale to hold it
down, their doings wouldn’t count to-day.
Their bargains belong to the Middle Ages,
and are as much out of date as the Statute
of Laborers.
* * * *
A short and feasible way of dealing with
the case would be to enact that if. in any
year, Australia’s exports are not sufficient
to pay for its imports, and to pay the in-
terest on all its public and private foreign
liabilities so far as they can be estimated,
and to wipe at least £2,000,000 off the foreign
debt., all customs duties should rise, auto-
matically, by 20 per cent. If, next year, the
drift continues, they should rise another 20
per cent. After, that they should keep up,
or keep on rising, until the leeway is
made good. This arrangement need not be
called Protection if anybody objects to the
term. It can be called Theosophy or Faith-
healing or Day-baking or Dry Bee-farming
or any old name that will please somebody.
The desire to please somebody is inherent
in this paper. The essential point is to
make sure that Australia shall develop into
a country that makes its own goods and pays
its way.—Signed in conformity with the Act

GIVE US SOCIALISM IN OUR TIME,
O LORD!
Within the last few weeks one of the most
inveterate of the New South Wales Conges-
tion papers has been driven to mention, in a
non-committal fashion, the existence of •he
harbor of Port Stephens. The place has
received unexpected applause. It is quite
as deep as Sydney Harbor. It is larger than
Sydney Harbor, and it has a good entrance
and is well-sheltered. There is no big
river flowing into it to silt up the mouth in
flood time, as is the case with Newcastle.
It is as convenient as Newcastle to the
principal N.S.W. coal field. It could be
turned into a workable port, and a great
city could be pegged out on its shores, for
less money than it costs to dig the sludge
from the river entrance of Newcastle after
the Hunter liiver has been in flood. Port
Stephens could serve as the deep-sea outlet
for the exports of at least one-fourth of New
South Wales, thereby greatly reducing the
pressure _ upon Sydney—the overcrowded
place which tries to be the solitary commer-
cial gateway for more than 309,000 square
miles of country. As a matter of fact, New-
castle has never contrived to be much more
Ilian a coal port, and at best it has been an
unsafe and artificial port. Many of the
steamshios which haunt Sydney dare not go
to Newcastle to coal, and have their fuel
brought to them at Circular Quay, and
transhipped at considerable expense. As
for wool and wheat, Newcastle’s trade in
these exports rather diminishes than in-
creases. Around Port Stephens is a great
area of fairly-level land, on which a city
could be built. Much of this land
is owned by the State. The rest could be
resumed at a very low cost, for, by reason
of the City Congestion policy which has care-
fully deprived this magnificent sheet of
water of anything in the way of accessibility,
lest it should compete against Sydney and
Newcastle, the present value of' privately-
owned land in the vicinity is almost nil.
There are great chances for the State about
Port Stephens, and we want some Socialism
in ourJTime if we can possibly get it.
Our time will be short and we will be
dead very long. Most people are dead, and
they have been dead most of the centuries.
People like Adam and Cain have been
almost always dead. Therefore if we desire
Socialism in our Time, as the motto of the
Brisbane Labor paper has it, we have a right
to hurry. Socialism doesn’t wholly con-
sist in the State running unpayable rail-
ways, unprofitable tramways, little groups
of laborers’ cottages of the Daceyville pat-
tern which don’t pay for axle-grease; steam-
ships and road-metal quarries and brick-
kilns. of which the Auditor-General speaks
with profound disrespect; workmen’s com-
pensation devices and baby bonuses, which
are all outgoings and no income, and all man-
ner of small debris of the sort —while leaving
the unearned increment of the business sec-
tions of overgrown towns to the private land-
lord. It ought to aim at the bigger things,
and the biggest thing it can aim at in
N.S.W.. so far as it is possible to see
at present, is the job of being sole ground
landlord of two or three new places as
populous and as progressive as Sydney. The
harbors are available —at Port Stephens and
Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay. So far as
the first-named place is concerned, the Lord
has already provided the deep water, and the
adjacent coal deposits, and the desirable
town-site. It only requires about as much
money as the Holman Government spends
in sending its friend Nielsen on a trip to
the United States to set the enterprise going,
and to start a huge income from ground
rents coming in. The income is sure with
any semblance of honest treatment, for a
very large and fertile section of N.S.W.
is now taxed in an absurd fashion to pay
for railway freight to a distant port when
this equally good port is close at hand.
Given access to it on fair terms there would
be an undoubted future for the State-owned
Babylon on its shore. And, as already
mentioned, we want Socialism in our Time
—large, healthy Socialism, not a mere pot-
tering of two or three workmen round a
Government joinery or brick-kiln, nor the
spectacle of 12 earnest Government sup-
porters busy for a week cutting clown one
tree.
* * * *
The Bulletin speaks in this matter as
the only Labor paper surviving in New
feouth Wales. It adheres to the State
Labor party’s programme of honesty, strict
economy, reduced borrowing, increased sink-
ing fund, decentralisation, abolition of the
upper House, and State ownership of land,
which the Holman Government has deserted.
At the same time it fully recognises that it is
talking of principles—not politics. There
are votes to be lost at Sydney and New-
castle by any Government which attempts
to create rival centres. There is hardly a
single vote to be gained at Port Stephens
or any place of the sort until the new city
gets into working order. If an election
occurred between the hour when Sydney and
Newcastle became infuriated and the day
when the votes of some of the new cities
became big enough to count, the Govern-
ment which attempted a real scheme of
decentralisation in the interests of the State,
or in the interests of all Australia, would
possibly go out. That is why there seems
to be little hope of Socialism in our Time.
The crowd which preaches Socialism, and
which is so dependent on the private land-
lords of the big cities, and is so much afraid
to declare war to the knife against the Ton-
papers which support the private land-
lords in the big cities, has a long row to hoe.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another Conversion Imminent.
A stage is always reached, at one time or
another, where Australian Liberalism drops
assailing any given progressive proposal,
and begins to blame the other side for not
having set about it with sufficient fury in
the past. This signifies that Liberalism in-
tends, presently, to adopt the thing as its
own. The final move is for the section
which opposes every new idea, as a matter
of course, to Claim the entire credit for
originating the reform. One has seen the
brazen process in operation in the case of
Old Age Pensions, Arbitration, Compulsory
Service and a dozen other changes that
have come of late years. The first of wliat
may be called the conversion stages has just
been attained by the Cook party as regards
Anti-Trust legislation. Every other Fusion
orator is saying something like the following,
which emanated from Senator Oakes, of
N. S. Wales, a night or two ago:—
He referred to the Coal Vend and said that the
Fisher Gdvernment did nothing to break up the so-
called Sugar Trust, the Tobacco Trust or the Beef
Trust.
It is the sort of half-lie that goes down well
with electioneering crowds. It is correct
that the FisiiEß-ites didn’t do any damage to
the Trusts named, not, however, because
they were unwilling, but for the reason that,
under the Constitution which Liberalism
has battled strenuously for years past to
keep unaltered, they were impotent. The
Fisher Government's first Anti-Trust move
was directed at the Coal Vend. This was a
Combine which had admittedly fixed the
price of coal at an inordinate figure, and
ruined at least one competitor who had re-
fused to. do its bidding. In 1911 a prosecu-
tion was begun. It was still going strong in
the middle of 1912, when the Sugar Commis-
sion was appointed to find out whether or no
the_ Colonial Sugar Refining Co. was an in-
jurious trust. It was commonly known, so
far as this institution was concerned, that
its monopoly was complete; that it had used
the latter, from time to time, to raise the
price of sugar to a preposterous extent;
that, as a result, certain businesses (the
Australian Jam Factories Proprietary Ltd.,
lor example) have had to suspend opera-
tions: that country storekeepers were driven
to sell sugar at cost price (or, in other
wouls, make the combine a free gift of their
services, as salesmen, and of the use of their
shops) ;.that the co.’s disclosed profits had
not been less than 10 per cent, for many
years, and that the real figures were pro-
bably very much higher. The Sugar Com-
mission started to probe into these matters.
The first witness of importance, a director
of the C.S.R. Co., refused to reply to the
President’s questions. The rest of the direc-
tors declined to answer to their subpoenas.
The Commission dissolved, after a while, in
an atmosphere of futility. It was recon-
stituted later, with a different personnel, but
as it had no power to force from a witness
any. information which the latter was un-
willing to give, and as all the witnesses of
possible value were, necessarily, interested
parties, nothing of a nature harmful to the
C.S.R. Co. was elicited. About this time
the judgment of the High Court in the
matter of the Vend Case materialised. It
laid down the amazing proposition that,
under the Constitution, the Coal Vend was
not only an inoffensive concern, but an
actual boon to the Commonwealth. The
Australian Government had been offered a
unique chance to prove “detriment,” in the
case of the Coal Vend, since it had access
to the secret books and minutes of the prin-
cipals. It was recognised that if an accu-
sation of the sort could not be legally
sheeted home, under such favorable circum-
stances, against the Coal Combine there
was scant hope of getting the smallest frag-
ment of clianae out of any other combine.
And so the absurdity of fattening the law-
yers, to no purpose, at the expense of the
general body of taxpayers was discontinued,
and the Fistier Government entered upon
its fight for the amendment of the Constitu-
tion. Liberalism began by greeting this
scheme with scandalised howls. It postu-
lated that the Constitution was a more or
less sacred thing, drawn up by able men.
and that it was too young to be interfered
with, anyhow. The reasonable answer of the
progressives was that whether skilfully
drawn up or otherwise, and whether young
or old, the Constitution had demonstrated
its powerlessness to provide effective anti-
Trust legislation; and the demand for its
alteration was repeated. In a little while
the Liberal caucus—which is in most re-
spects the Labor caucus, as the latter would
be if it was troubled with arrested mental
development—will be calling for drastic Con-


stitutional amendments- as vigorously as it
once called for a Defence policy of present-
ing Dreadnoughts to Britain. But for the
purposes of the present election Liberal
speakers will continue to. inferentially',
accuse the Fisher party of fostering Trusts
the flimsy justification being that their
opponents were unable to defeat a Trust
with their arms tied behind their backs, and
tlieir eyes bandaged, and their legs in irons.

Liberalism at Home and Abroad.
The tale of “10-2-4”:
Bruce Smith, M.P., supplied a Sydney audience
with a dash of history last week, by way of assisting
the fortunes of his party:—
“The English political parties that always fought
to conserve privilege and preference were the cham-
pions of kings and nobles —the Cavaliers, the Tories
at a later date, and, still later, the Conservatives.
The opposing parties were the Roundheads, the
Whigs, and, later, the Liberals.”
The idea was that the Liberals of Australia are
the prototypes of the Roundheads, Whigs and Liberals
of England; and that the local Laborites correspond
to Cavaliers, Tories and Conservatives. It is a novel
point of view which is worth analysis. The Cavaliers
were, of course, the Loyalists of their period. They
were “King's Men,” as opposed to the Republican-
minded Roundheads. Had there been such an in-
stitution as Empire Day, in the 17th Century, the
Cavaliers would have celebrated it. Had the
National Anthem been in existence they would have
sung it repeatedly. They put loyalty to the throne
and person before everything, revered titles, and were
strong on the propriety of attending levees and Court
functions generally. One sees in all these things
their resemblance to the typical Australian Laborite
or I.WAV. enthusiast. The Roundhead was like an
Australian Liberal in many respects—he worn clothes,
had eyes in the front of his head, walked on his
feet when sober, and so on. But he was essentially
what the average member of an indigenous Empire
League would term “a disloyal hound.” He had no
opinion of the throne or person. Ho spurned them.
Xor did he rank Parliaments much higher. Cuoit-
well summoned two Parliaments during lus Protec-
torate. The first met in 1 (i 5 1. A hundred and odd
members were immediately tiling out. on the ground
that they were hostile to the Government—in a word.
Oppositionists. Three months later this Parliament
was dismissed. In 1056 a fresh one was summoned.
Another hundred Oppositionists having been ejected,
it got to work, but was dismissed in the beginning
of 1658, after which this sturdy old-time Liberal
did without Parliaments. Cromwell was the first
British Liberal, by the way, to make a regular busi-
ness of selling his military opponents abroad as
slaves.
The other ancestor which Bruce Smith claims for
Australian Liberalism is the Whig. “Whig"’ was an
old Gaelic word signifying “horse-thief.” Later it
came to mean a rebel or disloyalist. To call a man
a Whig in the 17th Century was equivalent to calling
him a pro-Boer in the 19th. The Whigs despised the
extravagant loyalty of the Tory party—the party
which Bruce Smith regards as synonymous with the
local Labor crowd. At the time of the Restoration,
when Tories were to be seen leaping with delight at
every street corner, and free ale was available in
barrels, and the dreadful odor of oxen roasted whole
was everywhere, the Whigs looked on bitterly, and
accused their Labor opponents of “mafficking”—that
is, they would have done so had the word been coined
at the time. After the Revolution the Whigs became
respectable, more or less. At any rate, they were
rich. From then onwards Whiggism was the politi-
cal creed of the land monopolists and the importers.
The Tory party consisted of farmers, parsons and
ultra-loyalists of riieans. The Whigs were united on
at least two matters —their hatred of the Crown and
their determination to preserve the rotten borough
system, by means of which the overwhelmingly power-
ful country magnates were able to pack Parliament
with their nominees. The Tories were the Radicals
of the early part of the 18th Century, in so far as
they aimed at abolishing Parliamentary corruption.
Their progressive tendencies stopped at this stage,
however; and it is a fair thing to assume that they
objected to the rotten borough arrangement chiefly
because it was of value to their political opponents.
Ihe Tories were still as effusively loyal as a modern
Orange gathering. The Whigs found it hard to
express their contempt for the King in words, and
resorted to lampoons which would give an Australian
Empire Leaguer the horrors. The letter of Junius
in the Public Advertiser to Georoe 111. was
acclaimed by the Whigs as a master-stroke of patriot-
ism and genius. It woidd get a modern Liberal six
months. Undoubtedly, if Kino O’Malley had lived
m the Georgian era, he would have been a Tory—
since one has Bruch Smith’s word for it that the
Bruce Smiths of those days were Whigs.
And then there is the relation between the Aus-
tralian and the English Liberal parties. Thcv
are so alike that they might bo twins. Consider
some of the more striking points of resemblance
between the British Liberal leaders of the past 15
years and Bruce Smith. Like him they have
always been Home Rulers. Like him they regarded
the Boer war as an injustice. It was a Liberal
I rime Minister who invented the phrase “methods
°f barbarism. ’ It was a Liberal Government which
refused to officially recognise Empire Day. Liberal-
ism in England, as in Australia, is the party of
SociaLsm. Sir William llarcourt’s Death Duties
Jut the rich of the United Kingdom far
harder than Fisher’s Land Tax has hit Aus-
tralian property-owners. The Asquitii Government’s
latest land proposals are revolutionary in their
severity. They would appeal powerfully if intro-
duced here by the Cook Government to' a Liberal
Conference. They might even cause the conference
to burst or go mad. Nothing so Socialistic as the
Asquith Government’s Insurance Act (the “hated
Act, as the English Conservative papers, or as Bruce
Smith might say Labor papers, put it) has been
achieved by any Australian Administration. Lib-
eralism in Britain is uncompromisingly Freetrade. It
refuses to palter with Protection. It is hostile to
compulsory service. If a Tory Ministry introduced
conscription, ’ British Liberalism would not rest
till it had abolished the un-English curse. Tn
brief, the farther one goes the more clearly one sees
that the Liberal party in the United Kingdom is in
everv resneet identical with the Liberal partv in Aus-
tralia. Tliev are as alike as W. M. Hughes and
Lord Lansdowne.
[John Bede Dalley, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
The Gospel of Time Payment.
Bkuce Smith has been making the Liberals’
financial policy plain. The no-borrowing
policy, be says, is “crude, ignorant and un-
just”: it is absurd to pay cash for a thing
that you are going to use yourself for a
long while aud probably band down to
future generations:—
The Liberal party arranged, before the Labor party
came mto power, to pay for the first fleet by loan,
distributing the payment over the years during which
the vessels would remain in use, and so divide the
expenditure equally over the different sets of citizens
who wouid enjoy the benefit of its protection. But
the Labor party dramatically repealed the Act and
resolved to pay for it all at once, out of the current
revenue, which was unjust. (Hear, hear.) The same
principle of Joan applied to what was called revenue-
producing expenditure, otherwise the present genera-
tion would be paying for a property that would not
be even partly charged to subsequent generations,
but would yet provide them with revenue at the
expense of the people to-day.
I’»ft of Bkuce Smith’s stock-in-trade is his
magnificent waistcoat. In January he wants
Olio of these garments. Now, 'some men
would go aud pay cash for it out of their
months screw. But Bruce knows better.
“No,” says lie, “tbe waistcoat will last six
months. It’s crude, ignorant and unjust to
make January pay the bill.” So lie goes to
bis friend Cohen and borrows 255., and
arranges to put by 4s. 2d. a month for six
months. In February he wants a pair of
sublime trousers to match the magnificent
waistcoat. The same thing happens again:
instead of paying up out of his earnings, he
visits Cohen once more, borrows another
255., and agrees to put by 4s. 2d. a month
for six months. Then he wants a superb
coat, and that’s 50s. Some men would save
up in March and April and pay for it. But
Bkuce Smith knows —he knows everything
- —that that would be crude, ignorant and
unjust. So it’s Cohen again, and Bs. 4d. a
month to be put by for six months. In May
lie wants a glorious hat. The polished, wise
and just Smith borrows another 255., and
that’s 4s. 2d. more to put by every month.
In June it’s hoots lie wants, and the same
thing happens again. lie gives Cohen an
lOU for 255., and agrees to accumulate 4s.
2d. a month for six months. An ordinary
fool would, of course, observe that by this
time Bruce had undertaken to put by 255. a
month ; and as the process would now start
all over again, the magnificent waistcoat hav-
ing soup-spots on it. the mere crude, igno-
rant ass would see that Bruce would have
to go on putting by 255. a month for ever
to pay Cohen, and he would wonder why
Cohen need come into the business at all.
The ordinary fool would suspect that lie
might just as well pay 255. out of his
month’s screw for a waistcoat in January,
and 255. for his trousers in February, and
50s. for Ills coat in April, and so on, and
save Cohen’s interest. But that is much
too crude, ignorant and unjust for Bruce
Smith. It is far too plain a proposition:
t<> appeal to him it must wear magnificent
frills, like he does, and have its moustache
waxed.
[S. IT. Prior, Bulletin Office, George-street, Sydney.]
The Misfortune of being Named George.
Duklng the reign of Victoria the Royal
Family of the United Kingdom suffered a
bereavement by the death of the Duke of
Clarence, eldest son of the Prince of Wales;
and that trick of fate made it possible for
the throne to be filled for the fifth time by
a king whose name was George. Otherwise,
it is likely that the traditions of monar-
chical ill-luck which are associated with
that name in the history of British dynasties
would have prevented it from being again
attached to the person of a king. It seems
to be certain that if a British king is
called George lie will do something to dam-
age the prestige of his throne and bring the
Crown into unpopularity with one section
or another. The first George was a bad-
tempered “wee, wee German laird,”
whose reign was distinguished by the
cupidity of the king’s German mis-
tresses and his preference for his funny
little kingdom of Hanover as a place of
residence. Neither of these facts endeared
him to the populace which dutifully drank
his health. The second George, who also
was accustomed to express himself in broken
English, is described by Thackeray as “a
strutting little Sultan.” lie said he saw
no value in "bainting an’ boetry.” He was
apparently a plucky and not quite undistin-
guished soldier: but he detested Englishmen
and was detested by them. The third George
was distinguished for stupid acts of political
interference, which ended in the revolt and
loss of the American colonies; and as a
bocdler of Parliament he could give les-
sons to anybody who is playing that game
to-day. After he became insane his suc-
cessor as regent and king was the fourth
George, who made the throne more con-
temptible than any other person who ever
sat. upon it. It is a fatality. If you are
called George you cannot be a popular suc-
cess as King of Great Britain and Ireland.
The fifth George has just made his mis-
take. He has got into his head the notion
of personal power which made George 111.
a blundering failure. The command to
party leaders to attend a conference was
a mischievous return to the obsolete idea
of the King as an active part of the national
government. The speech he made to the
politicians was worse than an error; it was
a calamity. In the opinion of Labor leader
Ramsay Macdonald, its wild prophecies of
civil war in Ulster would not have been
out of place in a Unionist candidate. The
Irish delegates accepted the King’s invita-
tion as a command, with words of cool
disdain, The Tory newspapers slobbered
loyally; but the Liberal drummers all stood
off and eyed the action of the monarch with
icy malevolence. With the best intentions
in the world, King George has made the
crown a Tory crown. He took the amazing
step of inviting Carson and Craig, though
those two. politicians are actively engaged
in promoting armed rebellion against the
King’s army and the King’s law. For more
than a year it has been openly stated in
French and American newspapers, though
not in reticent England, that the King is
against the Home Rule Bill and in sympathy
with the Tory half of Ulster; and
recent events will make it impossible for
any unprejudiced British subject to think
otherwise. And it all comes from calling
him George. With that burden laid upon
him at the font it was his fate to be. like
all previous Georges, a failure as a British
king. Naturally, his mistake won’t in-
volve any risk to bis job. The English and
Irish peoples are too tolerant for that. But
it will damage his reputation from now till
the end of history.
About Belfast and ’Derry and King
George.
These are the views of “Jeames” :
it seems to me, as an old and reverent studeiff
of Court life, that King George has done himself
far-reaching damage by butting into the Irish Home
Itulo row. Not that anything serious is likely to
come of the said row. 'the Orange legionaries have
been renowned during close on two centuries for tail
talk and poor performances. And the Nationalists
aren’t materially different. The hot-headed youths
on both sides like a scrap now and then —the
innocuous variety of disturbance which is waged
with sticks and bricks —but for organised civil war
none of them have much stomach, the Southerners
being too casual and good-natured, and the North-
erners too businesslike. None of which, however,
has anything to do with the case of King Georoe.
His astute father kept out of politics with such
assiduity that, to the very end, the Irish cherished
a sort of lingering delusion that he was a Home
ltuler. We know now, of course, that he was the
very reverse. Ilis unceasing cry, when in the
presence of his intimates, was: “The scoundrels are
trying to break up iny kingdom”—only his language
was stronger than that. King Geokge has been less
tactful, in proportion as he is younger and less
worldly-wise. He is King, and therefore Unionist,
and he has shown which way his sympathies lie
repeatedly. And now he has plunged (for that wise
old Asquith was so disloyal as to lead him there no
one will believe) into the heart of the fray. Long
before these lines appear he will stand in the mind
of every good Radical in the same gallery with such
fervent Party men as Carson and Londonderry.
For the first time since the Georgian era Englishmen
will feel that they have a political monarch. Ex-
cept that he will lose, thereby, a large measure of
that popularity which is the breath of life to
modern sovereigns, his immediate personal comfort
won’t be much affected. The “rebellion,” which a
fragment of a fragment of Ulster is talking about,
will simmer down the moment it is understood
that the British Government really means business.
But the precedent of kingly interference will have
been established.
The first to demand his attention will be those
well-organised and determined rebels, the suffragettes.
The bland assumption, on the part of King George
and his spouse, that these vigorous females are non-
existent can’t last very much longer. There is
the imminent likelihood of its being disturbed at
any moment by an accurately aimed brick. What
will his position be with the militant females of
the United Kingdom if he does the logical thing,
and presides over a Suffragette Conference—at which
conference he is bound to give away his utter
loathing of the whole movement? A Defence agita-
tion on the compulsory service issue is raging
briskly under the influence of Lord Roberts and
most of the ultra-Conservatives. The Cobdenite or
Little England section oppose it bitterly—far more
bitterly than any section in the Commonwealth ever
opposed the Australian Defence movement. What
excuse will the King have for declining to take part
in a Defence Conference when the dispute approaches
a head? Also what will his position be when the
next great railway strike occurs?
As a. matter of fact the chances are that by that
time he will, with the best of intentions, have so
exasperated large numbers of his subjects, belonging
to widely differing political movements, that, his
services as an impartial arbitrator will not be re-
quired. And when that time comes the monarchical
system in England will be in such a perilous state
as lo be almost uninsurable. There is but one wav
for the modern European king’ to remain popular-
or m other words, safe in his job—and that is tu
treat politics like a dangerous disease gent.
Going to England.
One Guy Windeyer, sou of a Sydney
bamster, and grandson of the emotional X.
' Vales Jud &e who used to be able to tell
an accused person’s guilt by the sort of boots
he wore, or something similar, has enjoyed
an unusual amount of free newspaper adver-
tisement of late. The reason is that he is
being sent to England with a view to enter-
‘“S th ? Bntash navy. If instead of going
to the Isle of lglit the child were off to
Jervis Bay and the Australian Naval Col-
lege, the press would hardly know that he
was alive. This is one feature of a some-
what miserable business. Another and
lather more deplorable side of it is that his
parents, who find this country good enough
to live in and make money out of, do not
consider, evidently, that it is worth while
defending. If every Australian father who
could scrape together sufficient cash to send
his sou to help protect a country on the
other side of the earth were to do so, the
Australian navy scheme, to which the Com-
monwealth is committed, and as to whose
wisdom all parties are now agreed, would
perish out of hand. The saving feature of
a situation which is nationally humiliating
in its own little way lies, of course, in the
fact that most Australians arc Australians
first and Windeyers some considerable dis-
tance afterwards. However, there is enough
of the dreadful spirit abroad to emperil, or
at least hamper, the local Defence system.
It was the despair of the imported naval in-
structors of a few years back, who found
themselves perpetually running against an
idea instilled into the boys by misguided
suburban relatives —that there was some-
thing socially lowering about an ambition
to serye Australia on the sea. Most new
countries are afflicted in this way to a cer-
tain extent. What is now the United
States, for example, was badly troubled with
it before tlie War of Independence, and to
this day many a newly-rich Yankee girl will
marry a stone-broke foreigner of title in
preference to. a solvent fellow-countryman.
It may be laid down as an axiom that one
of the. first indications of a dawning sense'
of nationhood is the absence on the part of
social clamberers of any haunting feeling of
degradation in the matter of being asso-
ciated with the defence of their native land.
Cheap Defence.
An old military man, whose name and
address appear underneath in conformity
with the law, writes as follows: —
Iceberg Irvine took occasion, at the F.S.A. Con-
ference in Sydney, to administer a gentle boost to
his colleague Millen. He mentioned that Millen
had “greatly reduced the cost of the Defence Depart-
ment, without in any way affecting its efficiency
The story looks an unlikely one on the face of it.
It is almost impossible to economise in the matter
of Defence and avoid the sacrifice of efficiency. But
in any ease no one can tell whether a fighting
organisation is efficient till it lias been tested in
war, because there are many parts of it, such as the
hospitals and ambulance, that cannot be tested in
peace, since they are unable to get an adequate
supply of sick and wounded to order.
A woman doctor who has already been quoted in
Tub Bulletin continues her experiences, this time
at a Bulgarian base hospital. The Director met
her, when she joined, and gave over to her the surgi-
cal cases. This was the state of things she found.
She was taken into a room 12 x 14 feet in area,
with seven beds, all occupied: “These were all
frozen in the second snowstorm in March. There
were 20 wounded limbs in that one room, and there
was no need to ask in what state the wounds were.
In spite of open windows the atmosphere told its
own tale. Gangrene had been at work.” The Direc-
tor: “When they arrived we were determined to
save everything possible, but in many cases the' fin-
gers came away like a glove when we opened the
dressings, or we would find the line of demarcation
well marked on the hand or foot—and what could
we do?” That was the worst room, but there were
three other rooms, and 60 more patients in another
building—wounded as well as frozen cases: “All the
wounds were septic and discharging, though none
of them were so appalling as those we had treated
in our first little hospital.” The wounds had become
septic because the men had not been collected and
treated quickly enough.
The Bulgarian army was only trained and equipped
for fighting, not for curing wounds and disease. It
was, and is, a cheap army, and for that reason not
only was the number of men actually killed in
battle greater in proportion than in tlie old wars,
because the men exposed themselves more freely, but
the number who died from disease was greater,
because the hospital and ambulance services were not
properly organised. The big guns and the rifles
were the best that money could buy, but for hospi-
tal and ambulance transport, the slow and primitive,
but dirt-cheap, bullock-cart was used —a vehicle
which could travel, at most, not more than 10 miles
a day and would take a week or more to reach the
nearest hospital on the line of communications.
Australia is not much better off. It has no
organised transport of any kind, no supply of
stretchers, and no ambulance vehicles, and they
cannot be improvised at a few days’ notice. The
attempt to get a few artillery ammunition waggons
locally made almost broke down the Ordnance De-
partment a little while ago. Millen’s drastic econo-
mies are not really a matter for national self-gratula-
tion, and no one but a lawyer or a tailor or some-
one of that stamp would imagine they were. On
the contrary, they bid fair to very soon destroy
what little there is of the Australian Defence system.

A craving to dig out the land and throw it
into tlie sea is characteristic of the alder-
man. In Australia the land is flat, where-
fore the rainfall is poor. The coal supply
is not great and the timber supply is scarce,
consequently fuel is not abundant. Also
the sea is rather shallow along the coast, in
consequence of which good harbors arc less
numerous than they should be. In such a
country there are two plain and obvious
things to be done with the garbage of the
seaport. One is to burn it and convert it
into light and heat and power, in order to
save fuel. The other is to take it far
inland over the mountains by rail, and use
it as a means of elevating the flat sur-
faces. Nobody save an alderman or a
mayor would dream of dropping it into the
sea a mile or two away, so that the land
may become flatter, and the sea shallower,
and the defunct dog may wash up on the
beaches and get between the feet of the nice
girl who is trying to have a swim. Yet
the aldermen of Sidney have decided to re-
vert. (o that barbarous contrivance. They
have also propounded the theory that foot
passengers should keep to the left, whereas
the Sydney police regulations, and the regu-
lations of every other civilised city in the
world, direct them to keep to the right. In
this matter the police of Sydney have scoffed
at the aldermen, and treated them with the
A Pig in a Poke.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
, P le dredge Seagull, which was reported at Thurs-
day Island recently, and which sliould arrive in
S'Uney some time next week, has been purchased by
the Sydney Harbor Trust. She has come from Cal-
cutta. The Harbor Trust authorities state that the
vessel is really a steam punt, but, apart from this,
they are apparently unable to give any further parti-
culars regarding her, —S. M. Heiiald shipping news.
Ihe Harbor Trust has bought a dredge—a
stately dredge is she
(As far as we’ve particulars), as such a craft
should be:
She has a funnel and a mast —but, stay!
there is a doubt
If she has really got a mast; but one day
we’ll find out.
The Harbor Trust is justly proud concerning
its new dredge,
But doesn’t know exactly what she’s like,
back, front or edge ;
She may be perpendicular, with depth and
breadth and length.
But as to details —well, the Trust has not
obtained “the strength.”
The latest news concerning her is that she’s
“on the way” ;
Of course she is imported and there’ll be a
bill to pay ;
Though what the bill’s amount will be, or
who the purchase made
Are matters of no consequence to Holman
or to Wade.
The Harbor Trust has bought a dredge that’s
said to be a punt;
What matter? To be curious about it would
affront
Some very worthy gentlemen with autocratic
powers
WTio’re Permanent Dredge-Purchasers in
“this fair land of ours.”
They’re men of vast experience in buying
sundry craft,
But dredges are their forte, because they’re
so like fore and aft!
Why, any fool could buy a ship with bows
shaped like a wedge,
But experts are the only ones to safely buy
a dredge.
The secret —May I mention it? —lies in the
lines, you know;
Some parts of dredges are above and some
parts are below;
It takes marine experience of many years to
see
Precisely how a dredge should' look, and how
its lines should be.
A dredge that had a private bar, for instance,
and a rink,
Would need a license and a band, for skating
and for drink ;
But if a dredge was meant for use, instead
of for display,
There’d have to be a boiler —-in the ordinary
way.
A dredge for pony-racing, too, would need
uncommon lines;
.V bookmaker would captain her, and give
the steering signs;
The crew, of course, would have to be strong
men prepared to punt,
Xo matter what the sea and wind, or how the
mate might grunt!
The Harbor Trust, rest well assured, will
see that every care
Is exercised aboard its dredge—which may
not need repair—
Whenever it may come to hand, or land, or
heel, or quay;
What is it like? My goodness! Ask the
Harbor Trust —not Me !
The Harbor Trust has bought a dredge, a
dreadnought, or a snow —•
Assuming that it’s not a hoy, or drogher—
Who’s to know?
She’s coming out here, presently, if David
.Tones is good,
All we need do is pay for her —let that be
understood!
The Harbor Trust —thank God we’ve one to
see to these affairs ! —-
Has bought a dredge—a splendid punt—so
no one frets, or cares.
She may get here, or she may not; she may
be good or bad :
Meantime the Harbor Trust can go on pur-
chasing like mad!

CROSS, FEVERISH, BILIOUS CHILDREN
NEED “CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.”
Look, Mother! See if the tongue is
coated; this denotes sluggish liver
and bowels.
Mother! Your child isn’t naturally cross
and peevish. See if the tongue is coated;
this is a sure sign that its little stomach,
liver and bowels need attention at once.
When listless, pale, feverish, “stuffy,” with
cold, throat sore; when the child has tainted
breath and doesn’t eat, sleep or act natur-
ally, or has stomach-ache or diarrhoea, re-
member, a gentle liver and bowel cleansing
should always be the first treatment given.
Nothing equals “California Syrup of Figs”
for children’s ills; give a teaspoonful, and
in a few hours all the waste matter, sour bile
and fermenting food clogged in the bowels
pass out of the system, and you have a
healthy and playful child again. All chil-
dren love this harmless, delicious “fruit laxa-
tive,” and it never fails to effect a good
“inside cleansing.” Directions for babies,
children of all ages and grown-ups are plainly
on the bottle.
Keep it handy in your home. A little
given to-day saves a sick child to-morrow,
but get the genuine. Ask your chemist for
a bottle of “California Syrup of Figs,” then
look and see that it is made by the “Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Company.” Counterfeits

it is time for somebody to scoff at them for
their craving to shovel poor flat Australia
into the sea, and spoil the few hills we have
and the few harbors we have. It is a
humble sort of ambition to make everything
a dead monotony, in which the boundary line
between a continent one inch high and an
ocean one inch deep will be marked by a
line of decayed refuse, and some ashes, and
a drowned pumpkin, and a lot of disqualified
lunch thrown out of hotels, and the cadaver
of a horse.

The infuriated shipload of Hindu emigrants
who demanded entrance into Canada has ap-
parently been repulsed, but it was only after
something very nearly approaching war.
Canada is much farther from India than
Australia is. It is nearer to British assist-
ance. It is only accessible to Asia so far
as concerns its very meagre western coast-
line, whereas all the long Australian coast
is handy to Southern Asia. The little bit
of Canadian coast which faces the Colored
Trouble is fairly well railwayed, which isn’t
the case with this country. Also, Canada has
more people to defend it than Australia has.

Overtime is being worked at the sacri-
ficial altar at Balaclava (Vic.). Wynne,
the Postmaster-General, set the fashion in
sacrifices by renouncing his Ministerial
throne in the presence of all the available
newspaper men, because he was tired of
the job. Then State Premier Watt, nearly
badgered to death in his old job, threw it
up to apply for a better one. Dr. Lee, hav-
ing no option in the matter, sacrificed him-
self to allow Watt to have a clear run.
Because of the same hopeless prospect,
Arthur Robinson, M.L.C., likewise quietly
passed himself out on the altar. Hewison,
who previously stood down in Boyd’s inter-
ests for an adjacent seat, on the understand-
ing that he would get the next prize-packet,
has kept quiet, and he has consequently been
added to the roll of martyrs.

street, Melbourne.]
It is a curious fact that, after all the
clamor, all the mudshed and all the blowing-
off of the mouth done by the Orangemen of
’Derry and Belfast, the first real fight of
the present Irish campaign should have been
at Dublin. The Home Rulers were trying
to do a little gun-running of their own, and
not being so sly and secret and dodgy as the
Belfast push they were discovered in the
act. Then the air was full of biff.
Guy Manning, who has been visible in
Sydney lißely, is a member of the well-known
N.S.W. family of lawyers and judges. In
1903 he went to Papua as Private Secretary
to George le Hunte, then Governor of the
Boiled Missionary Isle. When his chief
departed, Manning served Judge Robinson,
and later was R.M. of the North-Eastern
Division. Then he resigned, and with
another civil servant —a man of British ex-
traction —tackled a copper-mining proposi-
tion in the Astrolabe, and it turned out
pretty well. Manning’s chum, by the way,
was acting P.S. to Governor Robinson when
the affray occurred between the police and
the Goaribari natives . who had murdered
preacher Chalmers and preacher Tomkins.
He made an immortal name for himself in
Papuan history by rushing up to Robinson
on the Merrie England while the native
police and the cannibals were busy exchang-
ing bullets and arrows, and calling on the
Acting Governor to stop the disturbance.
If Robinson didn’t, so the wicked story ran,
the Britisher declared he would “write to
the Times about it.” But Times space
must have been valuable just then, for the*;
letter never appeared.
“Gazeeka”: An admirer of the late Tom
Bracken blew into Dunedin (M.L.) the other
day and asked to be shown the grave of the
poet. Nobody seemed to know anything
about the matter, and the visitor sought in-
formation at headquarters. Some documents
were dredged from the dust and the visitor
found that Bracken had been interred in the
Northern Cemetery. The grave was lo-
cated; but there was no headstone. The
mound had fallen in. and the surface was
hidden under weeds. The caretaker scratched
his head and wondered what the fuss was
about. To him it was Not Understood.
Some branches of the A.N.A. concluded a
while back that the initiative and refer-
endum was a good idea and urged the board
of directors to push it along. The directors
seemed agreeable—until the plank appeared
in the Commonwealth Labor platform.
Then they suddenly decided that the “time
was not yet ripe,” and postponed all propa-
ganda work till after September 5. After
that date thev will “consider the position
and decide what steps shall be taken.” The
fly is understood to have made a similar re-
mark when the wheel went round.

Beaumont Smith appears to have struck
a winner in “The Barrier” at Sydney
Adelphi. And if any one of the cast is more
responsible for it than the rest it is Cyril
Mackay. As ’Poleon Doret, the rough
French trader, he gets a better opportunity
than he did in any dozen Marlowdramas, and
he seizes it with both hands and his teeth.

pleasant change after the long spell of
“society drama” of the Melville type. The
plot centres round a mining field in Alaska,
where a rich pocket has been unearthed,
and the indispensable collection of crooks
make things so unpleasant for the usual
more-or-less spotless section that there is
considerable wear and tear of six shooters
and knives. Incidentally there are two of
the best stage fights that the Adelphi has
turned out to date. Through the whole
show there is that sprinkling of love-making
that prevents bellow falling as flat as the
_Cook Government’s policy (political allusion
signed by Kenneth Prior, 214 George-
street, Sydney). As already mentioned,
Cyril Mackay, the free and easy French
trader, is the real thing; and W. F. Grant,
though a trifle stiff at times, is a very pass-
able Lieutenant Burrell. But May Congdon
fails to make Necia appear as a girl entirely
brought up in the back country, with a
squaw as guardian. Rather is she like
a city girl burdened with a University edu-
cation. Of the rest Cecil Aldrich, as No-
creek Lee, and T. E. Tilton, as Runnion,
the crook, are worth lion, mention.
A remarkable show was officially opened
at Culwulla Chambers (Sydney) on Tues-
day by Premier Holman. A London col-
lector,' or syndicate, or something, has con-
ceived the bright idea of trying an assort-

on Australia before passing them on to the
U.S., where the market for such goods is

tures—a Smibert —is prohibitive, in all like-
lihood, so far as Sydney is concerned, being
1250 guineas. The local plutocrat will pay
such a price for a motor-car, but for a mere
work of art, no. In any case the Smibert
is not a thing of striking loveliness. It will
sell readily in New York, doubtless, for one
thing because works by this Master are ex-
tremely rare, and for another because
Americans have a sort of patriotic interest
in him. He went to Boston in 1724, and
stayed there till he died quarter of a cen-
tury later. Many of the pictures, however,
are beautiful enough to appeal to the most
uninstructed Philistine. There is a still life
by Andriessen —a picture of fish —that might
have been done last week instead of nearly
300 years ago, so perfect is the coloring.
There are some interesting portraits of
plethoric gentlemen of the three-bottle epoch,
striking arguments in favor of Drink’s habit
of empurpling the cheeks and giving a boiled
look to the eyes. Also a number of sea-
scapes and a few nudes. It will be inter-
esting to see if the sort of affluent citizen
who, when abroad, earnestly patronises the
galleries which specialise in works like these,
will bother about them when they are
brought, so ' to speak, to his doorstep.
The odds are he won’t. Most of the pic-
tures come from the famous Fitzhenry col-
lection, via Christie’s. The show will last
about three weeks.

Tenor Paul Dufault (every flapper loves
the Paul and has the Du-fo right now) is
introducing two bright ideas in concert man-
agement. First, so that the adoring flapper
may know exactly what the brand of the
next tin of honey is, Paul announces the
titles of his encore numbers before he sings
them. And, second, while capturing the
Sydney Town Hall for three positively and
utterly farewell concerts (Aug. 1, 8 and
15), he darts off between times and fills the
country air with melody.
“Madame X,” or “The Absinthe-Minded
Mother,” continues to drink herself to death
at Sydney Criterion. The meanness of the
State Government in opening a free rival
show for the morbid at Darlinghurst Gaol
caused some apprehension last week in the
mind of the box office; but now that the
White-washed city has closed its gates the
gallows-frequenters will get just as satisfac-
tory thrills out of “The Mother Who Took
the Wrong Husband” at the Cri.

After a brief season as a photo-picture
pagoda, the Palace (Sydney) will bo the
temple of mystery for a few weeks of the
magicians Le Roy, Talma- and Bosco. who
had all Sydney on the run when they showed
at the Tivoli in 1905, under the manage-
ment of ’Arry Rickards. This time they
(and some supporting vaudevillains) are
under the direction of E. .T. Carroll. The
show opens on Saturday night.
The fragrance of “Sweet Lavender,” or
moth-ball, will fade from Sydney Little
Theatre in a week or so.
If the public is as tired of being reminded
that the Tivoli is still at 81 Castlereagh-
street, Sydney, and that the programme is
the best the house ever had, as this writer is
of presenting the reminder, then he apolo-
gises ; but he’s got to do it to keep his job.
At the National Amphitheatre (Sydney)
the programme for the week has been pulling
sound business. Matilde and Elvira, the
Spanish dancers, Fernandez and May,
musicians, and one or two other favorites
have arrived at the end of their run, but
new stars are shining and all is well. On
Saturday six fresh-laid turns are promised.
Before this paper reappears two events
having no reference to the threatened Euro-
pean war, Federal politicians or Irish Home
Rule will have been celebrated at Sydney’s
Imperial Salon de Luxe. One will be a
masque ball (on Saturday night), and the
other will be a Thespian supper (on Tues-
day night). Political and war-wearied citi-
zens are recommended to be at one or the
other, or both.
“Bunty Pulls • the Strings” has only
another week to go at the Royal (Sydney).
Then it will go altogether.
❖ sg: %
“Gipsy Love” is here to-day; it will be
gone to-morrow —or at the very latest next
week —so theatre-goers are advised to act
accordingly. “The Girl in the Taxi” is to
be the next show at Her Majesty’s, Sydney.
This week’s Sydney pictures:—
Crystal Palace : “The Port of Missing Men” has
nothing to do with a certain Pitt-street cellar, but
is merely evidence that moving pictures have caught
the spy fever pretty badly.
Empress : “The Footprints of Mozart,” concerning a
composer who regularly got his MS. back, but kept
going, and “got there” in about 3000 ft. The
Bulletin knows some who would require 300,000 ft.
Spencer’s Lyceum: “The Life of Queen Victoria,”
a sort of moving-picture history book, with every-
thing left out that the Right Thinking Person
shouldn’t know.
“The Price of Thomas Scott” was £5OO
cash, and it nearly bought him—but not
quite. The play is Elizabeth Baker’s; the
occasion, its first production in Australia,
by the Repertory Theatre in Adelaide. It
was the gorgeous offer made for his corner
shop, where he was drifting, per drapery,
into insolvency; but just as the thing was
settled he found that the idea was to set up
a godless dancing-hall there. So lie had to
refuse, being built that way. He could
always console himself with a chapel-meeting
and a squabble with a fellow-deacon; his
daughter despairingly accepted the lodger;
nobody bothered about the boy, to whom a
few pounds in cash had been going to mean
a chance for the civil service instead of
drapery. The author handles with a light
touch a domestic interior with just two
interests: small and unprofitable trade, and
a brand of religion which consists chiefly of
talking about which girl in the choir will
get the minister. Still, Scott is an abso-
lutely honest man, kindly, even merry—he
sings “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” all about
the house —but inflexible where conscience
calls. After the modern method, the author
states the question fairly from every side.
However, an. audience, evening-dressed, and
three-fourths feminine, giggled steadily at
each mention of Righteousness or Conscience
(the Rep. Theatre’s subscription list has got
a long, long way from the little band of earn-
est students, with or without evening dress,
who founded it). Elizabeth Baker will be
heard of again. Imagine the self-restraint
of a playwright who can set the children of
wowsing parents waltzing, and not have
them caught in the act by Father! F. D.
Wilkinson, as the gentle but stubborn Puri-
tan, was best supported by Ivy Stacey as
the daughter and Roy Leach in the difficult
part of a schoolboy. Whittle and Wilfrid
Neill were sound as differing brands of
Puritan. The latter, on his single appear-
ance, brought down the house. He had skil-
fully made up as an exact copy of the wow-
ser in Orpen’s much-discussed painting. You
can’t get away from The Picture in Ade-
laide these days.

Julius Knight, called on for a speech in
farewelling at Adelaide Royal, felt bound to
apologise for having said a last good-bye
six weeks before. The present “Beaucaire”
week was a pleasant surprise. Irene Browne’s
mannerisms accord well with the 18th cen-
tury artificiality, and Leslie Victor and the
rest were their old clever selves. Edward
O’Neill, a fine actor, has left “Joseph” to
play the villainous Duke in “Beaucaire.”
The quaint, quiet Fields is back at the
Tivoli, batting his bat over the scenery, and
causing as much fun by the tricks he misses
as those he does. The American “Dexter”
at this house is unite out of the common as
cartoonist, double-handed sketcher and
humorist: his exit, through a door he has
just drawn himself, puts a neat finish to the
turn. It is his first appearance in Aus-
tralia. and he is going to be popular. At
the King’s, Hagan and co. have a vivid
Y'ankee thumbnail drama, there is much
good song and dance, and Neptuna in her
tank gives a welcome variety to the pro-
gramme. The gentle cultured Leonard Ber-
wick is playing at the Town Ha 1 !,
not so well patronised as he deserves. In

Let’s push, and crane and stare,
And conjure up the tragedy
Of dead feet in mid-air!
Here gaped Eternity for him
The old-time judges damned!

The floor that broke and slammed!
“Come on! We’ve seen enough of this!”
“All right! you lead the way!”
“Hey! see this cell!” “Beg pardon, Miss!”
“Fred! ain’t it cold and grey!”
The opened cells like dead mouths gape
All in a ghastly row;
The awful shadows lie like crape
But —Life drifts to and fro.
Oh! stones shall fall and bars shall rust;
But Man, you’ll kindly note,
Still seeks with an eternal lust
For gaudy gallows-gloat!

“O.K.”—his comment:—
The hand of the 1 guileless spinster and genteel
pedant is apparent in Mary Wilkinson’s play,
“Whither,” which got its promised show at Mel-
bourne Repertory Theatre last week. When the young
man who has “scraped through” his exam, proposes
to. follow the young woman who has “passed with
flying colors” into a mere commercial office, with a
view to earning the same salary as less educated per-
sons, she asks: “What good, is' a man without a Uni-
versity career behind him?” And when a smudgy
ill-favored piece of feminine misery lacks means of
support for herself and her bundle of alleged baby,
she whines that the only means of money-making
left to her is to “go on the streets.” This is a
shocking libel on the natural proclivities of mere
man. The outcast Magdalene of the Repertory play
couldn’t earn sixpence a week by perambulating the
public thoroughfares and appealing to evil passions.
It is a popular fiction with spinster ladies that any
sort of human creature in female form, not more than
30 years beyond the age of consent, carries an un-
failing source of income about with her. She has
only to go on.- the streets and wink promiscuously
and somebody will want.,to buy her favors, so the
Sex supposes. To :ft'H tire brutal truth, the Sex set-s '
much too high a'yalue on its sex attraction. On
the open market, in competition with Traviata' at
large, a terrible number of young, women might grow
old in making vain attempts to seduce the passing
profligate. Needy seedy virtue loves to believe that
it might change itself to flaunting, well-fed vice by ,
simply standing habitually at street corners after
dark, and making a noise like a dicky bird. The
belief is a fond delusion. For a plain, ordinary Phoebe
who has only herself to sell, the streets are the wrong
shop. She’ll get no customers for the alarming sac-
rifice she offers to the public. Why do women-
writers invariably tell her that she can? There, is
essential immorality in the doctrine that “going
wrong” is the last resource of the Sex.
After a specially prosperous week with
“The Yeomen” the G. and S. Co: at Her
Majesty’s, Melbourne, descended on Satur-
day to “The Pirates of Penzance” and “Trial
by Jury.” As compared with their other
works of famous collaboration Sullivaki’s
music seems rather better than the libretto
in both of these operas. Gilbert is extra-
vagant in his notions. He strains after
comic effects. The Pirates, who take pity
on orphans and love their Gracious Sove-
reign, .are but crudely humorous, like the
major-general who lodges his large family
of sweet young daughters in a ruined chapel.
“The Trial,” too, is rather a ridiculous farce
than a witty travesty. It is all very funny,
this double bill, but none of it shows Gilbert
at his very best. In a pleasing all-round
performance the strongest item was Miss
Lincoln’s capital singing of “Poor Wander-
ing One” —quite the best thing she has done

thusfar. Miss Morrison took kindly to the
character of the ancient virgin who house-
keeps for the pirate crew. McKeown was a
tuneful, amiable Frederick, whilst the boss
pirates (Wilson and Arnold), the majah-
general (Waller) and the Sergeant of
Police (Kavanagh) erred only on the side of
moderation. They might have swaggered a
little more. The chorus of pirates, young
ladies and policemen went through their
duties as though they loved ’em, and the two
scenes were almost as satisfactory as the
efforts of the orchestra, under conductor
Burton. In “Trial by Jury” (where the
fooling sometimes obscured the charms of
the music, and the judge’s song fell rather
flat), Miss Pearl Ladd played the plaintiff,
and the principal men—barring Wilson —
appeared again. “The Mikado” goes up next
Saturday (August 1), and an eager popu-
lace can be confidently expected to rush the
old favorite.
Mischa Elman returns to Melbourne Audi-
torium next week for farewell concert pur-
poses. The dates are the sth and 10th, and
sandwiched between the concerts at the
Audi, will be one at the Town Hall, on

Hayes and R’lves, one of whom tangoes

Ford and Davis in their "night-out” sketch

Changes of bill are impending at all four
of Melbourne’s playhouses-in-ordinary, other
than the vaudevilleries, where variety is the
soul of business, and no bill ever remains in
its entirety for two consecutive weeks at a
stretch. At the King’s the tricks of Leroy,
Talma and co. have already ceased to be.
Harry Lauder, formerly of the Princess’s,
will bring his show to the King’s to-night
(Thursday), and for seven nichts there-
after his remarkable legs will have the run

or three of these farewell occasions the braw
Scottish comedian will introduce some sangs
that he didna sing at the other hoose, to-
gether wi’ “Roamin’ in the Gloamin” and the
same old “We Deoch,” which sends the audi-
ence humming back to its ain fireside.
At the Royal the end of the present Niblo
season is to-night (Thursday). On Satur-
day the much-postponed revival of “A Royal
Divorce” restores what the management calls
“The Pomp and Panoply of War” to local
notice, and the British bulldogs of bello-
drama will bark defiance at defeat, as of
yore. Miss Irene Browne plays the Joseph-

The Melbourne Tivoli programme con-
tinues to present Ada Reeve as the prime
attraction. Thornley Dodge, the skit and
sketch man, Taft the Avhistler, Don and
Patty, and the Vellions are there, also a
soprano has joined the ballad-singing depart-
ment, in which Ralph Errol, operatic tenor
from America, cuts no ice to speak of. But
Ada Reeve is the turn that matters mostly.
Her latest songs and monologues are not
worthy of her cleverness in making them go.
They want all the theatrical art she can
devote to the job, and one shudders to think
how some of them would refuse to go at all
if an inferior Ada were in the saddle.
Spencer’s main suit at Melbourne Majestic
on Saturday was “When Reuben Fooled the
Bandits,” a Keystone comedy presenting it
hero devoid of any rational purpose in life.
“With His Hands” was an acceptable Edi-
son drama, and “Millions for the Defence”
was the Vitagraph Co.’s latest idea of a
humorous narrative.

“R. 8.”: I first met the late Harry Diver in Broken
Hill in 1888, when we were both absurdly young lie
24 and I 20. He was a kindly, quiet gentleman, with
a biff spirit in a frail body. Great vitality made his
slight muscularity look foolish. He played strenuous
parts immediately following on a serious hsemoirhage
at Adelaide. As Nelson in “The Mariners of Eng-
land” he went through all the racketing of four
acts, and as the curtain fell on “Kiss me, Hardy,
the hemorrhage recommenced. And that was many
years ago. His best parts were lago played to
Rignold’s Othello —it would have been better _ only
that Rignold’s enormous vanity was hurt at Diver s
success on the first night, and he made lago out out
a lot of good business that stole limelight from the
star —and a quietly villainous Carker-like part in “A
Bunch of Violets,” produced by Dacre and Amy
Roselle. He played heavies in rough-and-tumble
melodramas for years, but it didn’t spoil his hand
for character —when he could get it. He was the
Yamamoto of my play of “White Australia,” and
was Jap in character as in make-up. His last job
was the production of “The Servant in the House,”
at Sydney Repertory Theatre, and the playing of
Manson for six nights. Rehearsals on rainy days
had much to do with his finish. Had Diver persisted in
the medical career his doctor father planned for
him (he left his job of a medical student in his
second year for the stage), he would probably have
been alive now, with years of life before him. _ Of
course he might have taken a number of other lives
in the course of business, but he would have taken
them like a gentleman. As it was, he was a man
with much artistic pride in his profession, a thinker,
a modest, kindly, gentle soul —who bore permanent
ill-health and frequent poverty with smiling courage.
Charles MacMahon, who has just recovered from a
severe illness, celebrated the occasion last week by

“Boh”: An old man, clad in whiskers, as in a
garment, caused a sort of mild riot on the opening
night of “lolanthe.” He had soaked in Gilbert and
Sullivan years ago. Furthermore, he had soaked in
something even more stimulating at a considerably
later period. So often as the opening notes of a
favorite number smote his ancient ears, he would
fling them (the ears) back and make the entire
neighborhood smell like a saloon bar as he intoned
the introduction. He held forth to bored young men
of previous performers, and wept noisily down the
back of their necks over singers of the dead past.
“Notes like a bird, my boy,” he would wail, while
so misbehaving. “Nothing like it now— nothing.”
In the interval unfriendly hands led him forth, and
firewater did the rest. He became the entire show.
The centre of interest shifted from the stage to him.
He mixed grand opera, comic opera, tragedy, Niblo
and Brother Oswald Snowball, L.O.L. He sang the
Soldiers’ Chorus from “Faust,” snatches from “Pina-
fore,” fragments from “FAfricaine” ; also the “Boyne
Water” and “You Made Me Love You.” He raved
concerning Emelie Melville, and became maudlin
about G. V. Brooke. Members of the audience who
had come either to hear the 1 fnhsic or to hold each
other’s hands said “Shoo!” and “Hush!
pressed peanuts and cough drops upon him. i hey
did everything imaginable in the Way of peaceful
suasion. In vain. He insisted on being an entire
grand-opera company on his lonesome. And at last
there sounded “off,” as they say in the “profesh.,
the slow, fateful footsteps of an approaching Johr}
Hop. The last words that the audience heard emerg-
ing from the tangled countenance of the aged enthu-
siast as he was pushed out were passionate eulogies
of Lucy Escot and Squires.
Harry Diver, the brilliant actor, was buried .iif
Waverley Cemetery, Sydney, on Monday. No mana-
ger or manager's ghost or manager's executor came
along and deposited any arrears of salary on the
grave.
Auckland (M.L.) reckons it has found out a musi-
cal genius named Henry Lissack, aged 10. ’He is
said to be able to stroke the violin in' a way that
makes his hearers forgive their enemies and forget
their creditors. The prodigy has appeared at numer-
ous concerts, and has earned the commendation of
all the local experts. The usual effort is to be made
to rush him Europewards in search of tuition and
polish and the other ingredients that,, when added to
genius, produce the great musician.
“lvaniva”: Moving pictures are responsible now
for closing one of Melbourne’s oldest and best-known
food fountains. Parer’s hotel, restaurant and cafe
have housed and fed countless thousands from all
parts of the world during the 40 years of its ex-
istence. Now it is to be the home of the Star Pic-
ture Co., which has hitherto occupied the building
known for so many years as Kreitmeyer’s Waxworks.
In the ’so’s Parer’s site was a timber-yard ; up till
then, or thereabouts, the original Parer had been
content to sell his cakes from a basket.
Re a recent announcement that “Pygmalion” was
to be played in Australia by an actor-manager lately
arrived from S’Africa, it is understood now that it
won’t be —unless H. H. Champion is first argued
with. Shaw has appointed Champion his Australasian
literary agent, and has filed a power of attorney for
that purpose with the Registrar of Copyrights in Mel-
bourne. All Shaw’s works are copyrighted here, and
no one may now perform them without H. 11. Cham-
pion’s permission.
“Bilrock”: The death, on .Tune 19, of H. Brandon
Thomas, author of “Charley’s Aunt,” recalls some
facts concerning that comedy (which netted the play-
wright something like £100,000). Translated and
played in 18 languages, the piece has a record of
250,000 performances. Over 1000 English players
have taken part in it. The curious tiling is that
this comedy, which has dragged the guffaw from the
world and his missus, was born of the blues.
Thomas, after several failures in a higher class of
dramatic work, wrote it during a fit of despond-
ency, and it was only through the intervention of a
business friend that he held out for royalty terms
instead of selling the MSS. outright.
“Private Boxer”: In spite of the unprecedented
ad. it gained by the expletive used by the second
Mrs. Cornwallis West, George B. Shaw’s “Pygma-
lion” is to be succeeded at Tree’s London playhouse
by Louis “Joseph” Parker’s new version of “David
Copperfield.” Shaw may be master of the reclame,
but, as I have before had the temerity to assert,
he is no master of play-writing. This piece pro-
vides a splendid example of his ineptitude. He
relied for the whole effect of one act on the shock
of surprise that would be the result of a naughty
word coming from the mouth of Mrs. Patrick
Campbell in a London drawing-room ! The house
was duly shocked on the first night; but what sur-
prise or interest was there for any subsequent
audience ?
“0.K.”: It is alleged that every time a revival of
“A Royal Divorce” is threatened in Sydney or Mel-
bourne the management receives letters from people
who offer full and particular details of the Battle of
Waterloo. One “veteran son of a Waterloo veteran”
was told to call at Melbourne Royal with “a vivid
account of the battle, as given him by his father.”
As though any foot-soldier’s personal experience
covered a considerable portion of the ground! If he
had much time for looking about him he couldn’t see
far into his smoky environment. Battles are beastly
smoky things, and no two excited participants in
the Waterloo proceedings seem to have been quite
clear as to what they saw at the time, or heard soon
afterwards. Moreover, the second-hand vivid accounter
of nowadays is likely to be a son of Bill Adams.
“Midchannel”: 1 can’t suffer “Harrison O.” to
escape without a parting word. He accuses me of hav-
ing brazenly misquoted him (B. 23/7/’l4), and then
deliberately evades the main point at issue. In my
par. I laid stress on the fact that the best evidence
of Sullivan’s knowledge of orchestration was the “re-
adaptability of the instruments employed
to the music.” That is, where oboes are used, the
dominant air suits the oboes and wouldn’t suit. trom-
bones, and so on; further, that the variety of instru-
ments employed was a tribute to the composer’s
knowledge. I still cling to that. But “Harrison
O” breaks away from this main point altogether and
maunders on about the art of counterpoint, which
I merely said embellished Sullivan’s work. I didn’t
contend that it signified a knowledge -of orchestration
at all. When counsel asked a witness, “Did you or
did you not know, when you married the woman,
that she was at the time a widow?” he replied, “I
didn’t know her father at all.” That’s “Harrison
O.’s” method entirely.
The only fresh development of the Orpen-painting
fuss in Adelaide is that two visiting variety artists
from the King’s Theatre have had a hard fight to
avoid arrest for attempting to snapshot it. They
acted quite innocently; but various illustrated
papers would give a good deal for a photo of the
picture, and the Art Gallery people, are resolute
not to allow one to be taken. The childish “primi-
tiveness” of the caricature, and the unusual realism
of the nudity, would be over the odds without the
coloring to carry them through. Meanwhile the
turnstiles click merrily all day, and thousands turn
art-critic who have never been inside the Gallery
before.
London, which so obstinately “adapts” certain
American plays before giving them a hearing—
“Everywoman” and “Within tbe Law” are instances
of a setting changed from American to (alleged)
British for the London market —is now having
thrown at it a specimen of the reverse action. “The
Belle of Bond-street,” taken to London Adelphi by
a Yankee co. that bas made a good thing of it in
the States, turns out to be simply the old “Girl
from Kay’s” Americanised. This is the musical
comedy in which G. P. Huntley, as Hoggenheimer,
used to explain that he wasn’t Rude, but Rich.

Darlinghurst Gaol, Sydney, has been thrown open
to public inspection for a week, and is being visited
by thousands daily. —News item.
Now come with me, my little man,
And see the famous haunt
To which they led your Uncle Dan
For laying out your aunt,
The cage from which but few escaped when once its
gates were banged,
The dear old gaol wherein your male progenitor was
hanged.
The Government of New South Wales
Would elevate your mind
(A task at which it rarely fails),
And that is why we find
That you —and by this Ministry which has been so
much slanged—
The right have got to view the spot on which your
sire was hanged.
Observe that cold and narrow cell,
Inadequately rugged,
And bare of ev’ry comfort —well,
There Uncle Dan was jugged
For dealing with your aunt. Its iron doors upon
him clanged
The self-same year in which your dear, dead father,
child, was hanged.
And now we reach a Sacred Spot....
Observe that Hole—that Beam
Imagine falling, like a shot....
(You may have, in a dream).
And you will get some dim idea of Justice many-
fanged,
And grim and weird, as She appeared, the day your
dad was hanged.
Enough. We turn with hearts aglow,
And seek the outer air,
With brighter, healthier minds, I know,
For all we’ve seen in there.
For having viewed the gates which on your Uncle
Dan were banged,
And that dark room, of fear and gloom, in which
your sire was hanged.

any subsequent stage—that medical examination
showed the girl to have been a virgin! With inside
knowledge concerning the affair, 1 affirm that Ger-
trude McAlister had no time for Mcßean, and it was
her refusal of his overtures, and her declared inten-
tion of going away from Wee Jasper to avoid him,
that excited his jealousy and unseated his mental
balance. “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,”
and the same can truthfully be said of some varieties
of the male. Moreover, it is proverbial that the
dementia consequent upon an attack of Love is more
acute when the victim is middle-aged. Mcßean was
35. It was apparently the workings of a conscience
trained in the atmosphere of the “unco guid” which
suggested the tenor of the written “confession.” It
was not the girl’s life that was sacrificed to Mother
Grundy, but her good name; and the homicide pre-
sumably supposed that nothing could arise to clear
her. By (he way, the tortoise-pace of the Law in pur-
suing Mcßean, commented on by The Bulletin, may
or may not be accounted for by the circumstance
that some very wealthy people indeed are connected
by marriage with the Mcßean family. The Law has
to do a long think before it suspects a man with
wealthy connections.

The Sydney University Debating Society
devoted a recent evening to discussing The
Bulletin, and decided that it was no good.
It is simply wonderful how many Tory
debating societies give an evening to this
paper, and how few discuss the Evening
News. Incidentally a person who puts B.A.
after his name said that this paper’s occa-
sional abbreviation of the Governor-General
to “G.-G.” is blasphemous. The person, as
already mentioned, calls himself “8.A.”
Possibly he writes now and then that
something will happen “d.v.” The
Woman’s Letter received what is called in
low society “slops.” But then the W.L.
commented rather coldly, some time ago, upon
the absurdity and vulgarity of many Uni-
versity students when they hold one of their
revels. Since then the University, whenever
it heard of her, has held its breath with rage
until it grew purple in the face.

BLOBBS (rapping peremptorily on his own mantel-piece with a tumbler): “Look 'ere, bar-

Joseph Cook has a positive genius for inaccuracy.
Thus, iast week, to a number of Chatswood worship-
pers, he said: “No country in the world ever was
pioneered by the Government stroke... .The history
of all great enterprises is the history of some great
man.” The very State in which he spoke was
pioneered by the Government stroke. Almost as lie
was orating they were celebrating at Penrith the
construction of the N.-S.W. Western-road, which was
made by gangs of convicts, guarded by soldiers and
directed by military officers. The whole labor sup-
ply of those days was controlled by the Government,
and the pioneers did practically all their track-
blazing and so on, with the help of an abundant
supply of assigned servants. And, finally, how many
of these pioneers could by the wildest exaggeration
have been called great men?

a strenuous spinster who took her medical
degrees in 1902, and lias since been a house-

wider experience in India and London. Her
grandfather was a famous doctor of Ade-
iaide’s early days, who tore around to his
patients on a pony as famous as himself.
She stood for the University Council last
November, when five of its members had, as
usual, to submit themselves for re-election;
but the electing body, the Senate (which
means all the graduates), could not see its
way to turn out one of the useful former lot
to make room for a newcomer. So she was
advised to wait for an actual vacancy, and
oil the occurrence of one she has “romped

chairman of the Parliamentary Commission

one woman, 20 men elected by the graduates
(but not all graduates themselves), and five
nominated by the State Parliament from
among its own members.

There were no small chances of slaughter
at old Darlmghurst gaol (Sydney) last week,
owing to the multitude of women who tried
to stand at one and the same time on -he
trap-door of the gallows. If the decayed
trap had given way it wouldn t have been
exactly a hanging, for these women had no
ropes round their necks. ?\ov w°uld it
have been exactly any other kind of
execution, for at no time in N.S.h.
history has it beep the custom to
execute even the most morbid lady

a gruesome vision of squashed hats.

actions are tainted? If the grounds look
solid, the politician forthwith shouts for the
appointment of a commission, and labors
to have the inquiry so shaped that the pith
of the charges shall not be touched. Mean-
time he points to the image and cries “Sub
Judice!" Then the subject cannot be fur-
ther ventilated till the commission has
spoken. That means in numbers of cases
shelving the whole trouble. The public
hasn’t much of a memory. If let at the
subject immediately interest was aroused, it
would have carried the thing to a conclu-
sion; but “Sub Judice ” was invoked, and
the public turned to something else. Law
courts are similarly so far under the evil
influence of “Sub Judice ” that a man with
money to pay for appeals can keep down the
public discussion of his conduct till people
have forgotten that lie ever had any con-
duct.

V The Curlew.
Availing across the timber came the plaintive call
:of the Curlew.
And the l J oet, listening, read into it the voice of
-Unsatisfied Longing, a sad hunger for the Unattain-
able. It was, he held, a threnody over Dead
iDreams and Spent Desires.
Then the call of the Curlew ceased.
“Ah,” said the Poet, “He is silent. lie finds
there is no longer ease in giving utterance to his
pain. The only easeful thing is Death!”
But the Poet was wrong. The Curlew had found
hig Best Girl. He was revelling in Life.

smallest of them would net him at least Eighteen

.'So he filled the Copper from the Tap, kindled a
fire beneath it, and then, tenderly, lest they should
cast their claws, he transferred his Lobsters, one by
one, into the cold water.
: Then he stoked up again and got a good fire
going.
The water soon began to get warm. The Lob-
sters didn’t approve of it, each blaming his fellow
for the discomfort, fighting among themselves the
-more furiously the hotter the water became.
5 And so, they fought and died, each believing to
bis Death Grapple in his fellow’s fault.

THE FORM OF ILL-HEALTH THAT MOST
PREVAILS IN AUSTRALIA.
We are told that the consumption of medi-
cine is greater in Australia than in any other
country, and this must be attributed to an
unsatisfactory condition of health affecting a
large proportion of our people. What then
is the prevalent form of ill-health ? All indi-
cations point one way—to the fact that the
average person suffers most frequently from
some disorder of the digestive functions, which
might be easily corrected by the right kind of
treatment. Modern medical authorities teach
us that most of our common ailments have
their origin in the digestive area. In a word,
we poison ourselves (autointoxication) by
absorption from the intestinal tract. To over-
come this condition, the best remedy is
petroleum, because unlike other remedies, it
reaches the intestines unchanged, where it
exercises its lubricating, anti-fermentative,
healing effects to the fullest extent. The
original and standard preparation of petroleum
for internal use is Angier's Emulsion, which
has been largely employed by the medical
profession ever since 1892. Apart from its
soothing, healing properties, Angier’s Emulsion
(because of the hypopbosphites which it con-
tains) exerts a marked tonic, invigorating
influence which makes it of value in a wide
variety qf disorders. Doctors prescribe it
largely, not alone for lung troubles and wasting
diseases, but even more for digestive and bowel
disorders. Very good results have followed
its use in the treatment of gastric catarrh,
gastric ulcer, mucous colitis, nervous dys-
pepsia, chronic constipation, and in many
obscure digestive and bowel disorders that
have resisted other treatment. Of all chemists

There were some unusual features about
a suit in the Melbourne Supreme Court last
week, when Elizabeth Strack sued Arthur
Williams for £lOOO for toying with her
rejuvenated affections. They had been en-
gaged in ’O7, but he gave her the bird and
married another, who presently died. And
then he met Eliza again, and all the old pas-
sion returned in an overmastering flood, till
in an access of uncontrollable love he dashed
himself at her feet and remarked, “Miss
Strack, will you walk out with me?” or
words to that, effect. And, woman-like, her
answer was "Yes.” And so they walked
and walked, till at last Arthur, a confirmed
non-staver, got tired, and once more essayed
to end the journey. The next thing he knew
he was caressing a writ. lie admitted in
Court to possessing £3OO, which he “kept in
a little black box under the bed.” The
jury said his walking exercise would cost
him £125. As he has to pay costs—his own
come to £90 —he will have no use for the
little box for quite a while.
The old Biblical injunction against muzz-
ling the ox that treads out the corn seems
pretty well observed already on the N. S.
Wales railways. Nevertheless, on behalf of the
employees a claim has been made for more
mouthfuls of corn in the shape of additional
free-passos. In explaining that an increase
“would considerably add to the difficulties
of the Department in providing adequate
accommodation for the conveyance of the or-
dinary paying public, the Department quoted
some figures. During the year ended March
28, 1914, free passes to the extent of 370,000
employees or their families had been issued,
and this meant the aggregate accommoda-
tion of 1230 trains. Add to that vast con-
gregation of deadheads the politicians and
the ex-Ministers who have j)eon long since
shunted from politics, and the conference
delegates and the sporting parties and others
who receive special concessions, and the man
who has paid hard cash for his ride
may spend the long waits outside the. bottle-
neck in estimating how much of his fare
goes to pay for other people’s cartage.

“John P.’s” conclusions :
Booze and its high priest Bung seem to have got
to the last ditch in M.L. Anyhow, they are prepar-
ing for their Waterloo, and are endeavoring to make
the best bargain possible. The plain fact is that,
with a little luck, they will escape annihilation at
the poll in November ; but nothing short of an abso-
lute miracle will save them three years hence. In
the existing conditions it is inevitable that within a
few years the Loan Isles will become totally and
absolutely “dry,” for, of course, under the threat-
ened system of National Prohibition even the bless-
ing of a bottle of whisky in the portmanteau will be
denied the thirsty one. The something that should
be done before it is too late is State Control. Under
the present system a lot of decent people vote against
Bung every three years because he is a Private Enter-
prise institution, and is consequently responsible for
a crop of evils that would vanish if the State had
only the courage to grapple with the moisture pro-
blem. But the State in Maoriland seems to be
afraid of the whole thing. The Prohibitionists are
a force to be reckoned with these days in polities.
They total about 56 per cent, of the active voters,
and as they have decided to leap on everything at
the coming election that stands in the way of Cold
Tea the harassed politician, who wants to gain or
retain his seat, is compelled to stand from under.
Massey’s one hope of surviving the coming election
is to pacifv the Prohibitionists, and as Joseph Ward’s

party is also highly civil to the “dry” brigade, it
seems probable that it will get what it is howling
for. And that is a reduction in the majority at
present required to end the drink trade from 60 per
pent, to 55 per cent. It’ll be either that or the bare
majority. In the latter case Bung can put the
shutters up right away. He’d be killed stone
dead in November. With 55 per cent. he
might escape by the skin of his teeth for
another three years. His idea, meanwhile, is to ask
for an extension of the time that he is to get to
wind up his business if National Prohibition falls
upon him—at present four years. He wants it made
into seven years. That’s like Bung, he can’t think
of anyone but himself. If he’d been a little more
decent and a. lot less selfish and greedy in the past
he wouldn’t be so much in danger now of getting
the axe. But what about the average, decent citizen?
Has beer got to go with Bung? That is the question,
and if the temperate citizen doesn’t find for the
defendant Beer before another three years are up,
Hobart or Sydney will be the nearest pub for him
for many a day.

“Croson” : A recent mortality table issued
by statistician Knibbs and gathered from the
last census returns shows that the married
male dies least frequently of either married
or unmarried males or females between the
ages of 20 and 35. From 35 to
45 the unmarried female hangs
out most vigorously, but from the
age of 45 right to the end of the
allotted span—os and over —the
married female goes to her long
home less often than anybody,
lvnibbs’s figures confirm the gen-
eral belief that married persons
live longer than single ones, ex-
cept in the case of women during
the reproductive period. The
figures, however, merely concern
themselves with the number of
years spent on earth. This writer
knows a man who, since reaching
manhood, seldom slept more tlnin
six hours out of the 24, and has
for years averaged five. Ilis wife,
however, retires regularly at 9
p.m. and seldom rises much be-
. fore 8 a.m. She may dwell here
some years longer, but she won’t have lived
nearly as long in reality. Life is, after all,
something else than a mere matter of side-
stepping Death.

“Eblana” reports progress
When the Melbourne University was founded, in
the early 50’s of last century, four plots of ground
were reserved for colleges for the four principal
religious denominations. Since then the Church of
England, the Wesleyans and the Presbyterians have
built on the ground given them; but the Roman
Catholic plot has remained vacant. The late Arch-
bishop Goold gave all the money lie could get to
the erection of St. Pat’s Cathedral, on Eastern llill—
one of the biggest things in Australia, and not fin-
ished yet. Then the State Schools Act caine on, arid
the R.C.’s —or some of them —-refused to send their
youngsters to the “godless” schools; so they had
to face the heavy expense of providing their own
brand of education. 'That left them with no money
to build the College at the University.' ‘ Now, Coad-
jutor-Archbishop Mannix is taking the thing in
hand, and £40,000 has been put up for it. But
he says he wants more than double that sum. When
it arrives the College is to be called after Newman,
the Cardinal who was once a well-known Oxford
University man and an Anglican, but ’verted to
Rome and was for a time Rector of the Catholic
University at Dublin.
The British Association picnic happens
very inopportunely. Learned men and
women coming in the midst of Federal elec-
tioneering turmoil find that nobody of poli-
tical importance has time for them. Neither
Fusion nor Labor can see any advt. in talk-
ing botany, geology, mathematics or archeo-
logy just now. There are no votes to be got
out of the subjects. A professor who could
discuss the d.vndmieal aspects of the Beef
Trust would be worth cultivating and per-
haps some poli-
tical leaders have
an eye on the
director of the
Dairying Re-
search Branch
for platform pur-
poses where the
pore farmer is
concerned. But.,
generally speak-
ing. the scientists
from Britain are
without a hope
of being thrust
into public notice
by politicians or
the press. What
the Gov.-General
says about them
at a banquet will
be of leys import-
ance than what a
bloke said to
Willy Watt at a
Footscray meet-
ing. The pic-
nic should have
been postponed
until circum-
stances were fav-
orable to official
welcomes and so
forth. The same protest often applies
to expensive funerals. An influential
citizen will allow his death to clash witli an
awful railway catastrophe, and then his
obsequies go for next to nothing.
Henry H.: The basis of the misery which
led to the murder of Gertrude
McAlister and the suicide of Norman
Mcßean was N. Mcßean’s alleged fear that
if something leaked out there would be a local
scandal, and his father “would have to leave
Wee Jasper.” The population of Wee-
Jasper (close to Yass. N.S.W.) is 122
people, and the place has two mails per
week.
Governor Stanley, of Victoria, recently
told the Farmers’ Convention at -Mary-
borough (Vic.), that ‘‘Victoria’s wealth lay
not in gold but in the cultivation of the
land.” And “so long as farming continued
it didn’t matter much if the gold mines
were closed down.” Which exasperated a
Bendigo mining man by the name of Veale.
He held himself in leash for two days, and
then arose and clamored to the skies, as
follows:
If there were no mines there would be no farmers;
... . the farmers would be unable to get plough-
shares or anything else if it were not for the gold-
mines.
So, according to Veale, there are no farmers
worth mentioning in such places as South
Australia. Ireland, Germany, Canada,
France and Belgium. It: is a truism that,
while there is permanent wealth in pro-
perly conducted agriculture, there is none
in mining. Yet many places contrive to
worry along without either gold mines or
wheat paddocks worth mentioning. Malta's
little blot of soil hasn’t a solitary gold hole,
and all the wheat grown on it wouldn’t, feed
its rats, and yet it thrives.

“10-2-4”: According to a recent issue of
the S. M. Herald: —
The Rev. .T. .1. Billings, of Newtown, said that,
no long tm tin: Ihitisli Umpire remained Protestant,
Orangemen would be loyal to the end.
Most of the Empire is not Protestant, nor
even Christian. This statement applies t<>
practically the whole of India, Ceylon, Bur-
mali, British Baloochistan, Hongkong, Brit-
ish Papua, the Straits Settlements, the
Malay States and various other Protecto-
rates, as well as to the greater part of
S’Afrlca, Nigeria (North and South), Gam-
bia and Sierra Leone. Canada, Ireland,
Malta, Gibraltar, etc., are largely R.C. Such
places as Trinidad, St. Lucia and the like
are chiefly U.C., where they aren’t pagan.
Australasia is, roughly, two-fifths ICC., and
the Catholics are a numerous and wealthy
crowd in England, Scotland and Wales.
Unless the Rev. Willing;; is conversing
through the soup-plate arrangement which he
wears on his head, nothing but invincible
ignorance is going to keep the type of Im-
perialist who specialises in a monkey-shave
from making yet another effort to kick the
British crown into the Boyne.

“Billy Blue”: Apropos the just-deceased
Father Birch, the last of the old-time R.C.
priests in receipt of State aid under Gover-
nor Bourke’s Church Act of 1880. Ordained
by the late Dr. Moriarty, Bishop of Kerry,
in 1554, he came to N. S. Wales in 1859 and
received the usual stipend at that time paid
under the Church Act to all licensed clergy-
men. This stipend was abolished in 18(1!
so far as future priests and parsons were
concerned; but those already receiving it
had still to be paid. Only two are now on
that old stipend roll—the Rev. Septimus
Ilungerford, who has been there since April
1. 1854: and the Itev. W. C. Hawkins since
1861. Both belong to the Anglican Church.

From Friday’s Sydney Telegraph :
The Governor, attended by Captain Wallis,
A.D.C., was present at the gathering of the High-
land Society, held at the Town Hall last night, in
aid of the Governor-General and Lady Helen Munro
Ferguson.
Dear, dear! High cost of living, no doubt.
Alban J. Riley, an ex-Mayor of Sydney j
died at Bunvood on Friday, aged 70. He
Avas born in Balmain ; his parents came here
at the instigation of Archbishop Tolding,
who kneAV them in Liverpool. The Arch-
bish. and Riley had been school-felloAvs.
About 1850 the family removed to Maitland,
where the Riley boys were schooled, the
Chief Justice of the High Court being a
contemporary. In 1559 Alban took a job at
Farmer’s, in Pitt-street. In 1800, Avith a
brother, lie commenced business for himself,
on the site noAV covered by Anthony Hor-
dern’s. Alban Riley sat in the N.SAV.
Assembly for South Sydney in the ’7o’s, and
was Mayor of Sydney in 3887. He and his
brothers gave the handsome high altar in
St. Mary’s Cathedral, in memory of their
parents. At one time he was a director of
the Sydney Telegraph Newspaper Co.
MISS VERONICA BEDFORD , aged 20,
contralto and composer, also daughter of
Randolph Bedford. She will shortly
appear in Sydney.
Luck still sticks to Captain A r oss, who
first sailed into prominence a decade ago,
in the Tilikum, a little Indian canoe with
which he did big voyaging first and slioav
business subsequently. After he had done
with the Tilikum he tried a voyage in a tub
and got out of that venture all right, to the
amazement of nearly everybody. Deciding
to more or less anchor in Australia,
he bought a three-masted schooner,
which he called the Tilikum 11. It kept
him going for years ; then, a month ago, he
sold it—and four days later it disappeared
in a big blow, crew and all.
[Meteorology and big blows being in the Common-
wealth’s keeping, this is signed by 11. A. Mercer.

because his hair will be longer than the other man’s.]
Died on July 21, by his oAvn act, Wil-
loughby Flower, Canon of St. Mark’s, Darl-
ing Point, Sydney. He was imported some
years ago to succeed Canon Kemmis (de-
ceased), a proceeding Avhich caused con-
siderable stir at the time. The high-toned
congregation Avere slow to take to him, pro-
bably because his physical attributes were
in striking contrast to those of the previous
incumbent, who was the handsomest cleric in
local Anglican orders. Anyhow, Flower
had undoubted mental attainments. Last
year his nervous system collapsed, and he
went to Europe on a health tour, returning
ou July 20. Next morning he was found
dead in his bathroom, with a discharged
revolver in his hand. Verdict: mentally
deranged.
Dead at the age of 80, Edwin Cocks, for
50 years a toiler in Sydney in the cause of
the afflicted. His familiar figure in the
Domain, surrounded by a collection of human
derelicts, was one of the best known of the
Sabbath side-shows. By his persistent
efforts his charges Avere provided Avith in-
A-alid cars, carriages and such comforts as
he could obtain for liard-up cripples. When
advancing years overtook the “Samaritan”
(which was Cocks’s nickname) the future of
these people Avas a great worry to him —a
Avorry which Avas relieved by some wealthy
people. Out of admiration for the old man’s
work they dug up funds to start the Home
for Incurables at Ryde. That’s Cocks’s
monument, and as good a one as a man
wants.
Octavius Palmer is just dead at Terang
(Vic.). His father was an English squire of
the Henty kidney, who brought his wife and
10 children to Launceston, in 1838, by the
specially-chartered ship Madras. In 1849
Octavius went to the Californian diggings;
but rushed back to Castlemaine in 1852.
With two brothers he next bought Dederang
cattle station, in the rough country between
Yackandandah and Bright. In they
sold out, and Octavius bought the Warran
Estate, near Warrnanibool, and held it till
ISB3, when lie entered into a bold contract
to supply Melbourne with country-killed
meat. In IS9B he was trying his luck in
Westralia; but it proved none too good, so
he once more settled in Victoria in 1902.
Sheep men remember him best for this: he
was the first to recognise the value of the
Romney Marsh breed for wet country, and
imported a considerable number in the early
’7o’s. A keen sportsman in all branches, he
was one of the pioneers of polo in Australia;
and, generally, he pushed his barrow Avitli
such tremendous energy that he often cap-
sized it.
The solemn Holder is being appropriately
commemorated in Adelaide. The short-lived
first Speaker of the Commonwealth House
of Reps, had the quality—most unusual in
the occupant of such an office —of being
always as ready to call a fellow-creature to
Salvation as to Order. He spent the very
last Sunday of his life in preaching. So he
gets the most fitting monument in the form
of a noAv Methodist church, to be called the
Holder Memorial.
John Macgregor goes back to Maoriland
Leg. Council, nominated by Massey. He
sat there for seven years as an appointee of
Seddon, but fell out with John McKenzie,
the fierce Minister for Lands, who wrote
Ministerial minutes with a claymore and
drafted a Land Settlement Act Avith a battle-
axe. After that rumpus Macgregor retired
—which was a pity, for he had shown him-
self one of the Great Loan Land’s ablest
men. He was one of two brothers,
Ilielanders, measuring about 13ft., Avho
landed in dour Dunedin a-many years ago.
The other was Duncan, a brilliant physi-
cian, who became Professor of Mental
Science at the University, and later on head
of the Hospitals Department. John prac-
tised IaAV, and married the only sister of
Stout, the present Chief Justice, then his
partner. The union was not for long, and
Macgregor, a widoAver, saw his son go the
Avay of most Scots and become an engineer.
Macgregor, while in active politics before,
Avas the ablest advocate in Maoriland of a
liberal system of compensation for accidents
to workmen, and for a sane system of
divorce. He fills in most of his spare time
stirring the Bible "in Schools crowd to fury.
Ilis skill in this direction is unsurpassed,
for his learning is great, and he lias a bitter
lip and a dexterous pen. He lives like an
anchorite and orates behind a torrent of
long, grey whiskers.
PREMIER PEAKE, of S.A., returns thanks
for the toast of his health.
The leg-pulling Edythe De Vere Smytlie,
who figured in the row between Willie Watt
and the Age and was described as a
bald-headed Mrs. Harris wearing whiskers,
recently gave place to “Balaclava,” who
said equally insinuating things about the
ex-Premier of Victoria. “Balaclava”
adopted the old device of furiously defending
the man he objected to against a charge
Avliich never existed, and Watt naturally
Avants £5OOO. Everybody naturally Avants
£5OOO.
Dr. Martell, the defeated Liberal candi-
date for Essendon (Melb.) in succession to
the retiring Watt, was not happy in his reply
to a heckler who wanted to know “wot abaAvt
legerslation aginst the doctors’ combine?”
Said the tactless Martell: “We have no com-
bine. All A\ r e have is an understanding—in
the interests of our unfortunate patients.”
It \A T as a badly chosen adjective. The patient
ought to be the fortunate man who is re-
covering, Avhile the sick felloAV who refuses
to be a patient should be a tombstone and a
ghost.
MUNRO FERGUSON , the new Governor-
General having a little chat.
Dead., aged GO, Dr. Gamaliel Butler,
a leading member of the old Tas-
manian Butler elan, which was started in
’23 by another Gamaliel (founder of the firm
of lawyers still going strong as Butler,
Mclntyre and Butler). Grandson “Gam”
was born in Tasmania in ’54, studied medi-
cine in London and returned to Hobart to
practise; went in for politics, and has been
member of the Legislative Council most of
the years since ’9O. He was Chief Secretary
in Elliott Lewis’s time, and again in the
recently-defunct Solomon Ministry. lie was
also a member of pretty nearly every blamed
old thing in the way of public movements
and institutions, and earned a crust and a
plate of soup in his spare time, of which he
hadn’t any.
Inigo Jones, now buried in England, was
one of the most valuable English generals in
the Boer War. When Kitchener and French
planned the big drive Jones had the job of
block-house making on the whole length of
railroad from Orange River to Stormberg.
There were 241 miles to be covered in 15
days, with camps every 1000 yards. Appli-
ances and men were very insufficient, but
Jones did it. The General was, of course,
named after Inigo Jones, the famous archi-
tect, and contriver of the masques so popular
under James I. and Charles I. There was yet
another Inigo Jones notorious in his day—■
a boy named Jones, who got the nickname of
In-I-Go from his absurd intrusions at Buck-
ingham Palace when Victoria and Albert
were newly wed. It was alleged that he
was once rooted out from under a sofa on
which they had been canoodling.
“D.”: Lord Rosebery, who, according to
the cables, was at the Smith-Carpentier
light, is probably the first holder of a British
Prime Ministership, since Palmerston’s day,
to attend such a function. Asquith is too
old-womanish, Balfour too lady-like, Glad-
stone was too wowseristic, Salisbury too
averse from contact with the common herd,
and so on. Rosebery’s love of sport has
done much to make him the political failure
that he is. The modern Briton approves of
a monarch or nobleman or squire who is a
Corinthian, but he desires nothing of the
sort in his responsible legislators. He asks
chiefly of them the solemn outlook upon life
which one finds in the born mayor. The
ideal Prime Minister of England is really a
sort of super-mayor.
THE WARRIOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fight in the Town.
Some excitement -a as occasioned in Nowra on
'i tiursday morning by a contretemps between ex-
Mayor Benny and Mr. E. Dawes. They had a dia-
lectic engagement for a few minutes over some
grievance, and then adjourned to Tbomson’s-lane, at
the rear of the livery stables, where a few rounds
were fought. Ex-Mayor Benny subsequently went
to the police station, and in the evening was elected
president of the Nowra School of Arts. —Seemingly
inconsequential item from Shoaliiaven (N.SAV.)
News (mil’ll,).
How perfectly it symbolises Life—
The eager life of him who takes no toll
Of weakling fear, but enters into strife
With joyous courage, captain of his soul,
And having fought like billy-o, and come forth whole
(in parts),
Is fawned on by his world—in Benny’s case a School
of Arts.
The crowd has little use for diffidence.
It likes the type of man who leads the way ;
To Thomson’s-lane, behind the stable fence,
And falls with sudden frenzy on his prey.
The masses take this sort of blithesome sportsman
to their hearts,
And make him king—if only of some back-blocks
School of Arts.
Our Cooks and Fishers, hankering for place,
And affluence, and honors and the rest,
May get a useful hint from Benny's case.
Uncompromising action is the best.
Genteel restraint deposits those who deal in it in
carts;
Stark fighting wins the plaudits of the nation's
School of Arts.

The viana of this bank is great, llow much it has
been worth lately to have T. A. Dibbs as
general manager The Bulletin won’t guess; but
the figure would certainly have to be big. For 47
.years he has been in his present job—so long that
he has come to be spoken of almost with reverence,
and a kind of halo has been suspended above his
chair. On top of that the bank has the somewhat
similar advantage of having another veteran, George
Judah Cohen, as chairman; in his old age people
have come to connect him only with great success.
Add to that a reputation for treating its staff better
than any other big bank in Australia —which means
in the long run that it gets, generally speaking, a
better staff to treat well —and you have most of the
explanation of the remarkable progress of the Com-
mercial of Sydney. Or, rather, you get an explana-
tion of how it comes about that this bank has secured
so large a share of the new business which has of
late years been available in N. S. Wales and Queens-
land, to which it confines itself. It hasn’t got a
branch even in Melbourne.
Go back to 1890, the year when the boom was
climbing to the top, and look forward on these
figures:—
1890. 1904. 1914.
Capital .. .. £600,000 £1,000,000 £2,000,000
Capital and reserves
combined .. 886.960 2,132,736 3,887,(13
Total liabilities 11,205,375 12,218,987 23,414,166
Advances... .. 9,440,046 9,134,983 13,962,748
Liquid assets . . 2,890,789 4,769,015 12,770,278
Debts compared
with funds .. 12.63 5.72 6.02
Liabilities com-
pared with
liquid assets.. 3.82 2.56 1.83
The striking thing in this is, not merely the fine
growth of the money at the service of the bank, but
the vastly stronger position which the bank is in
to-day compared with past years. In the old boom
days, when wild borrowing was not confined to
Governments, the Commercial of Sydney had over
£l2 12s. of deposits, etc., for every £1 of its own
capital and reserves. Since then, though its deposits,
etc., have more than doubled, it has got in so much
capital from shareholders, and has accumulated so
much surplus profits, that £1 of its own funds has
now to protect only £6 of public money. And the
position has improved more even than those figures
show, inasmuch as in 1890 the bank owed £3' 16s.
for every £1 it had in cash and other liquid forms,
and £2 11s. for every £1 it had in 1904, whereas
now it actually has an immediately-available £1 for
every £1 16s. 6d. it owes. These last figures ex-
hibit such extraordinary strength that one can’t be
surprised at the Commercial of Sydney being favored
with loads of deposits when deposit money is avail-
able.
Holding so much of its funds liquid (on June 30
it had nearly 5£ millions in coin and bullion, and
another millions in public securities and short-
call money), it isn’t surprising cither that its earn-
ings, calculated on capital and reserves combined,

Compared with some other banks—the ’Asia, for
instance —the return in proportion to capital and
reserves combined is, in fact, small. This is partly
because the ’Asia has so much in reserve which is
not visible. Thus it has written down its premises
account to nothing or thereabouts, while the Com-
mercial of Sydney item is £568,253.

Part of the increase in liquid assets is due to new
capital paid up; still, with £2,265,139 of new
deposit money received, the advances, have actually
shrunk. That conceivably could be a good sign ; but
in a new country which badly needs more manufac-
tures and more development, it is far more likely to
be a sign that the man who has moincy to invest is
not willing to invest it under present conditions.

The directors decided six months ago to pay the maxi-
mum 4 p.c. on the pref. shares; and that calls for
an extra If 10,587 a half-year. Though the dis-
closed profits had moved very little for years past,
they at once jumped £12,000. This suggests very seri-
ously that the statement of profits has been more or
less a joke. The directors had at the same time an-
nounced that they were going to recommend a 10 p.c.
dividend on ordinary capital. The latter, which
stands at £95,649, is all that is le’ff of the old
capital of the bank; the prefs. represent deposits
exchanged for shares. When the directors made their
announcement there was, as shown above, £803,800
of capital still alleged to be unrepresented by assets.
Certain pref. shareholders did not like the proposals.
They said, in effect, that, if the bank could forth-
with pay 10 p.c. on ordinaries, they (the prefs.),
who had hitherto been getting only 3 p.e., had been
—well, some of them used an ugly word. Proceed-
ings at law were thereupon started; and “acting under
legal advice the directors are withholding their recom-
mendation to pay a div. on the ordinary shares until
that suit has been decided.”
Proceedings having been commenced, the merits
can’t be discussed. It is still, however, possible
to say that the spectacle of a bank with an alleged
deficit of £771,085 paying a 10 p.c. div. would be
absurd. The fact of the matter is a new general
manager valued the assets away back in 1901. In the
circumstances he can be relied upon to have set them
at the lowest figure he could conscientiously adopt,
having everything to gain and nothing to lose if they
turned out better. Since then there unquestionably
has been a great increase in values, and it is fair to
assume that large sums have been realised in excess
of the written-down values. Some of these sur-
pluses may have been used to reduce the amount
shown as capital not represented by assets; but it is
highly probable that some were passed to a contin-
gency account —ostensibly to make good any defici-
encies there might be when other assets were realised.
The realisation of the old assets is now practically
complete. The remaining fragments are estimated
to be worth only about £32,000 (10 years ago they
stood at £1,650,000). Against that £32,000 the
bank owes £56,600. No contingency fund worth
mentioning is therefore needed now, and if there is
one it should be produced, and used to reduce the
capital-deficiency. After that—what? Is the manage-
ment going on for ever, or thereabouts, tipping profits
into the old orifice? Or is it going to do the sen-
sible thing and say, “We lost three-quarters of a
million by bad business 25 years ago. Now let us
cut it off capital.”

The bank has evidently been going dead-slow, no
doubt on account of the repayment of the old Trust
deposits. Notwithstanding that big disbursement, it
is still in a good, strong cash position; and with
a large exchange business and advances of over
£5,000,000, and with intact capital well able to
support its present borrowings, it should figure high
among Australian banks. It is to all appearances
thoroughly solid underneath, even though its sur-
face carries a smudge which might very easily be
wiped off.

The shrinkage in profits is said to be due, more or
less, to the fact that the bank has had to pay the
full extra income tax for the year, whereas ordi-
narily the tax would be spread over the whole 12
months. With £lOOO written off premises (which
still represent very nearly half the paid capital),
there is only a slender £1798 to lay bv; and the
wisdom of increasing the div. to 6 p.c. is, in these ■
circumstances, no less doubtful than it looked six'
months ago. However, it is easy to find cxcusbs for
the step. Banking success is largely a matter of
confidence, and, so far as a big section of the foolish
public is concerned, its confidence in a bank grows
with the dividend—a stupid line to go on, of course,
because the more profit a bank leaves in the business
and the less it pays out to shareholders, the stronger
it is. The City of Sydney needed public confidence
badly. Everybody knew that the backwash of the
boom had carried it far up Queer-street in the
’9o’s; and while others had written off capital to
make good some at least of the losses, the City did
nothing at all in that way. Many people suspected
(and they were probably right) that it didn’t tackle
the job because it knew that if it wrote off anything
like enough, there would be nothing left. The plan
adopted was to pretend that the capital was all there
and trust to luck and zealous economy to restore the
capital out of future profits and recoveries. Had the
public known how the long job was proceeding it
might have been quite satisfied. But it never knew •
so it mostly held off this bank, which didn’t make
the long job any shorter or easier. The only tip the
public could get was from the dividends paid. Ilence
no doubt, the eagerness of the management to put
\’P rate to the last point which the figures would
justify.
Even now it is impossible to say whether th l
assets are worth 20s. in the £ of their book value—
that is, whether all the capital is intact. The
market still disregards the reserves or alleged re-
serves, and writes about 12s. 6d. off the £8 shares.
Jhe .most the directors have permitted themselves to
say was at the 100th meeting, in January of this
year: “We assure you that it [the bank] was never
in a stronger position than it is at present.” So
far as the figures go, here they are:—

The improvement in the figures during the 10 years
is not so bad, after all. And there must have been
a vast improvement which the figures can’t show—
in the value of the securities on which old advances
were made. Probably most of the old unproductive
assets have been replaced by good, operative accounts.
From the payment of a 6 p.c. div. and the directors’
before-quoted remark the public has a right to
assume so, at any rate. Compared with the capital
the business is not large. But the co. has a big list
of shareholders, and among them are people with a
lot of pull. . It certainly would appeal to this paper
more strongly if it kept more coin in the till and
more liquid assets in the safe ; at present there is in
hand slightly over 30 p.c. of the deposits and other
liabilities. The proportion might well be better;
apart from that there seems nothing nowadays to be
at all nervous about.

The reserves shown there include £466,535 of pre-
mium capital. But the co. has other reserves which
it doesn’t show. For instance, there is the value of
all the new works charged to revenue. In the past
seven years £350,000 has gone in that direction,
independent of money spent on maintenance and re-
newals. Either the new works have been very remu-
neiative or the old works have increased enormously
m value: you can tell that from this comparison:—

I' or the earlier half-year the sales of gas were equal
to £7 16s. 6d. p.c. on the whole outlay on capital
account ; for the latter half-year, £l2 3s. 4d. p.c.
Certainly exes, have gone up too; but the steady
growth of profits, without any , increase of capital,
and with less than £lO,OOO added to the debenture
debt, shows that the eo.’s costs are no match for its
revenue in a long-distance race. The last little com-
parison shows that £231,273 has been charged to cap-
itai account in the seven years; and yet, as just said,
no issue of capital and less than
£lO,OOO of debentures. The £220,000 odd unac-
counted tor has been provided mainlv by what the
balance-sheet calls “Sundry debtors and others for
amounts due, including contingencies”—an item
which has sprung £220,000 in the seven years. It
isn t quite clear what “including contingencies”
means, put as surplus profits were formerly set aside
for contingencies, probably this alleged liability isn’t
wnoily a liability; and in that case the bulk even
ot the works charged to capital account during the
past lew years may also have been paid for out of '
revenue. The co. is on a good wicket all right. How
long the wicket will be left like this is, however,
uncertain. N. S. Wales has got its Gas Act, which,
though it gave the cos. all the benefits of the surplus
profits they had accumulated up their sleeves and
elsewhere, told them that they mustn’t accumulate
any more. They mustn’t even wear sleeves in case
piofits should slip up into them by any unfortunate
accident. And as the leading N.S.W. gas cos. mustn’t
pay more than 10 p.c. on old capital (except in
certain circumstances which are not likely to arise
for years and years), and as they can’t issue any
bonus shares or any more shares at all to carry divi-
dends beyond 7 p.c., their stocks are in back-
wash of the share market. Great Britain has a very
ermnoli t„ W ’ and the Melbourne co. has adversaries
enough to assure that sooner or later it will have
to race the same sort of proposition.

Although the N.S.W. Gas Act of 1912 requires com-
panies which come under it to supply the Govern-
ment with full accounts, the directors of this co. see
no reason why the shareholders should have the full
benefit of them as well, although nowadays the Aus-
evorvi-i • ( Sy dney) S' o '. lets shareholders know
everything. In fact, the northern co.’s accounts have
even less meat on the bones than they used to have.

Instead of sharing in the general prosperity occa-
sioned by the building and construction boom in
Sydney, the Hydraulic Power Co. finds it very diffi-
cult to even keep up to past performances ; and there
will have to be a big improvement during the current
six months if the year is to show average profits. If
the past six months’ renewals are charged against the
six months’ revenue, the profit, as shown above,
exceeds the dividend by only £575; and there isn’t
much margin for safety there. Electrical competition
is the cause of the trouble. The Hydraulic concern
used to practically control the installation and main-
tenance of lifts and elevators in Svdney. But, among
others, a very energetic electric "co.—Standard-Way-
good—began to make its presence felt. Higher costs
have no doubt fallen on top of that ; but this com-
parison of CToss-revenue figures for the December-
June half-years shows that the whole of the blame
doesn’t lie with increased expenses:—
1907 .. £12,461 1911 ’.. £11,270
1908 .. 12.294 1912 .. 12 409
1909 .. 11,436 1913 .. 11,521
1910 . . 11,260 1914 . . 11,442
the worst feature of the ease is that this shrinkage
has occurred in spite of the accumulation of consider-
able surplus profits used in the business. In ,luie,
1909, freeholds, buildings, plant, mains and stock
were valued at £111,875; by June, 1914, £137,422
had been dropped into the corresponding items. Thus
although the revenue-earning assets have been added
to by over £25,000, fhe gross revenue has moved
generally, downwards, as shown in the table. The
cash position is easy. Liabilities amount to only
£1490, whereas there are liquid assets (mostly book
debts) of £B4BO.

Zinc mill input .. . 345,425 350,120
Moreover, the co. had the use of the Horwood slime
process from April onwards, “and the returns there-
from have shown a progressive improvement, the
profit per ton of slime treated having risen to over
£2 10s. by the end of the year.” For this, E. J.
Horwood, the hard-working Broken Hill manager
for the B. H. Prop. Co., is entitled to buy a new
feather for his millinery. The shrinkage in profit in
spite of these things is due to rihe bad behavior of
the zinc market. The reports, though very ample in
most respects, avoid reference to this question.
Twelve months ago chairman Govett told the share-
holders in London that Lie average price of spelter
for the year was £26 3s. 4d., and the 35,000 tons
not finally settled for were then valued at £23. A
little over 12 months ago the market slipped on a
banana skin, and fell heavily to £2O 10s. at the
beginning of July, 1913. Since then the European
spelter combine (they call it a “convention”) has
limited output, and there has been a recovery to
£2l ss. The people who buy from the Zinc Cor-
poration have certain options as to the basis on
which they will pay; thus they may fix the price
payable for a large part of the output at the aver-
age of the ensuing six or 12 months. It is probable,
therefore, that the profit for 1912 was over-esti-
mated at the expense of the figures for 1913. Cer-
tainly it is just as true that the unsettled-for zinc
product may now have'also been taken credit for at
too high a price, which will be at the expense of
1914. The figure should have been given.
This shows the product dealt with during the year
and the quantity available:—
Treated. Available.
Zinc tailings, tons .. 350,120 1,663,693
South Blocks ore, tons.. 162,956 971,781
There is thus nearly five years’ work for the zinc
plant in the dumps and six years' work for the lead
plant in the mine. But besides the dump tailings
the co. has the current production from its own ore
—say, 3000 tons a month —and other new tailings
coming in under contract. Last year, of the 350,120
tons treated, only 178,417 tons came out of the
dumps; and at that rate work could continue on its
present scale for nine years. Future supplies from
outside are not likely, though, to be as big as they
were last year. On the other hand, the mine, though
low-grade, unquestionably contains much more ore
than has been included with reserves. The 971,784
tons before-mentioned “includes only ore actually
blocked out above the No. 7 level,” which is at
1050 ft. Now at No. 8 (1180 ft.) a crosscut has proved
60ft. of ore in one place and 70ft. in another —same
lode, of course—not counting 25ft. of low-grade
stuff; and at No. 9 (1310 ft.) a drill-hole, bored
during recent months, is in 88ft. of ore, mostly of
better values than the average treated last year:—

In the 260 ft. below-the No. 7 level there is thus, in
all probability, more ore than there is blocked out
above No. 7. Its value depends on the metal
markets. For purposes of comparison take the big

Extract from The Review, London, December 5,
1913: —“The Colonial Mutual occupies a unique posi-
tion amongst offices doing business in Australia, inas-
much as it is the first office in that country to submit
its affairs (including securities) for an independent

ported to Parliament that the Society is thoroughly
“sound and solvent, and able to meet all its lia-

i lie extra - p.c. of lead is worth a lawyer’s 6s. Bd.
or thereabouts. It is difficult to estimate the differ-
ence in the recoverable value of silver and zinc, but
it would probably be no 'more than 9s. 6d. Still,
the co., hasn't got. down to that No. 9 ore yet, and
it won t he able to maintain, as an average, the
values just quoted when it gets there. From this,
nevertheless, some idea can be formed of the kind of
ore the co. has ahead of it.

Of the assets here called liquid £244,242 are invest-
ments (mostly American bonds), £71,294 is lent on
security and £50,910 is in stores. From the total
£67,412 has to be deducted for the final dividend
for the year. The growth of the more or less liquid
surplus is in accordance with the declared policy of
the directors to save up not only the present capital
but. 10s. per share written off the 653,000 ordinary
shares when the co. was sowing its wild oats. The
chances of accumulating this money are improved by
practice of charging against revenue ss. per ton
of zinc tailings treated. In other words, the year’s
net. income was £78,017 more than the profit shown
in the table, though as against that there is, of
course, so much less material left to treat.

Re the Queensland National Bank (B.
23/7/T4). Manager Sewell, of the Sydney branch,
reports that a “special” repayment of old deposits
repayable out of profits was made in November,
1913 ; this being at the rate of Is. in the £ makes
the total amount paid off 9s. 9d. There is nothing,
by the way, in either the published directors’ re-
port or the balance-sheet and statement of accounts
by which the “special” payment can be traced. The
chairman, however, at the meeting in August, 1913,
referred to the proposed payment, and said that
another “special” Is. would probably be available in
November, 1916.
In spite of gloomy official forecasts,
N.S.W. Phosphates Co. is developing- fair quantities
of high-grade phosphatic rock. Crosscuts westerly
are .in phosphates for 40ft. and 60ft., and at the
same depth (52ft.) a south-east crosscut is in 80ft. in
rock of the same quality. Barrett has raised 600
tons of white and grey rock at this point, and is in
similar stuff in a shaft 250 ft. south-west, and again
400 ft. south. The bed seems to be 30ft. thick, and
from it a parcel has been sold at £6 per ton
delivered in Wellington.

At the Carpathia (N.S.W.) work is con-
fined to stoping, except for the sinking of No. 1

things up to pay another dividend.
The Wild Cherry battery at Ardlethan
(N.S.W.) has been started: “The chairman fired a
small cannon and declared the mill open.” Was it
loaded? If so. how many wild cats did it kill? You
couldn’t possibly fire a gun at Ardlethan without
bitting half a dozen—most of them already dead,
however.

chance. Tun Bulletin doesn’t envy it the job. If
it 'was this paper’s mine (which, thank Heaven, it

From Havelock Smith: The Australian
diamond has been with us for about 30 years without
showing any visible reason for its existence. Periodi-
cally, new arrivals upon the scene, not knowing the
sad history of the past, re-discover the fields. Old
alluvial deposits are re-opened, re-worked and re-shut
down, and diamond pipes are discovered which refuse
to draw. Again and again we hear of the hardness
and lustre of the local stones, and of repeated and
determined efforts made bj' South African and Conti-
nental ruffians to crush the industry, when it is more
than probable they have never beard of it. We are
further informed that the “society” ladies of America
demand the Australian diamonds, and will not be
happy until they get them. The various experts who
arrive from Amsterdam, Hampstead Heath, South
Africa, etc., all go away very much impressed with
the vast impossibilities ; and things remain in statu quo.
The experts in situ are chiefly South African. The elu-
sive matrix keeps on coming to the surface, but cannot
stand the daylight—except exhibit A, the one small
solitary diamond found embedded in the dolerite, like
a fly in the ointment. The diamonds found in the
alluvial have never helped the field much, 90 p.c. to
95 p.c. of them being classed as “rubbish” on the
markets of the world. This is evidenced by the fact
that, owing to their size, they are realising 16s. to
20s. per carat, as compared with £5 to £6 a carat
paid for Yaal River stones up to a carat in size.
I have lately read with much interest the highly-
colored report of the usual South African on the
Mount Ross mine, and its pipe-like developments.
This alluvial mine I know is doing a careful amount
of prospecting and development work, and will deserve
all it gets ; but the fact that it is getting travelled
diamonds, associated with tin (which certainly would
not come from a pipe) in the deep-lead watercourse,
would not lead one to suppose the gems were made
on the premises. However, the pine indications, such
as they are, should be worth following up, for one
has only to find a parcel of diamonds in any forma-
tion apart from the alluvial wash to create activity
on the field ; but for any man on the vague indica-
tion mentioned, without a diamond being found
apart from the alluvial, to say: “You have a pro-
perty of vast dimensions,” “I can see for Mount
Ross a diamond mine equal to the best yet discov-
ered,” and “this property is one of the finest mining
ventures in Australia” is pure nonsense and calcu-
lated to do harm. Next there is the published state-
ment of Mr. Dan Grove in reference to the Round
Mount, one of the rechauffe mines referred to. He
estimates the visible alluvial, i.e., calculated on the
face indications exposed, to carry £320.000 worth of
diamonds at 16s. per carat. A printer's erroi*,
maybe; but, in any ease, it is just as well to draw
attention to the fact that the diamonds run in
patches, and the Inverell Diamond Mires of London,
which expended huge sums on this field without anv
payable results, got, I am well informed, seven
carats to the 100 loads from the Mount. I look upon
it as a fair proposition for a small co., which, if all
the diamonds found reach the co., should pay satis-
factorily on the small amount of working capital
required. With regard to Mr. Grove’s suggestion for
a Federal Royal Commission to sit on the Inverell
diamond fields, with a view to making good against
any imaginary African or European combine, there are
always buyers outside any combine, unless the output
is very large, and they for some time past have given
all-round the full value, 20s. a carat, for the local
seed-product. Picked stones running two or three
to the carat would realise a much higher rate. A
third South African expert, Mr. Collingwood, states
in his report that he is greatly surprised at the con-
sistency of the Copeton washdirt, and expects that
his report will attract many well-to-do diggers from
South Africa to the Inverell diamond fields. I am
glad they will be “well-to-do” : among those who
have spent any time on the field they won’t find
many in the same condition.
To conclude, I am quite Satisfied, with my
knowledge of the industry, earned in South
Africa and Australia, that there is a very
sound opening for a properly-equipped co. to
prospect, with a boring plant and otherwise, south
of the present deposits, and awav from the existing
habitat, which seems to have in a large measure ex-
hausted itself, and in a direction where the largest
stones have yet been found. It would only require to
locate some 5, 10 or 15 carat stones to start a great
wave of prosperity in the Inverell district; but, on
present developments, I can only see it dimly in the
distant future.

The old Lady Shonton (W.A.) has been
given up by its present owner. Years ago this
mine was one of the 10 best gold-producers and
dividend-payers in the West. It had a fine body of
ore 700 ft. long, and at 400 ft. the shoot had every
appearance of going down. But it didn’t, and an
abrupt end came to what promised to be a brilliant
career. Ultimately the manager, backed by a local
syndicate, purchased the property and followed the
reef down to 000 ft. Several good patches were
met with, but most of the gold was swallowed up
in development and other exes. Latterly results have
been very disappointing.
* * * *
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) presented its re-
port for 1913 at the annual meeting in London on
June 25. During the year a further 3046 ft. were
driven and sunk, and although the grade of the ore
opened up was lower than in the previous year the
results were considered satisfactory. The balance
of profit, after making what is called due allowance
for depreciation, amounted to £26,764, but a divi-
dend paid since the year closed practically absorbed
this amount. Ore reserves are estimated at actual
145,582 tons assaying 365., and probable 40,200
tons assaying 295. Reviewing the year’s develop-
ment the manager says: “Nothing material has been
discovered in the No. 1 main series. In the No. 2
series at the 100 ft. level a fine, strong body of ore has
been developed, and the 210 ft. level gives promise of
assisting with supplies of ore during the coming-
year. At the 210 ft. and 310 ft. levels on the
northern series fairly strong lenses have been opened
up, but at the deeper of these levels more work will
he necessary before anything can be said.” Mean-
time a serious creep has occurred in the mine, and
the way the grade of the ore sent to the mill has
fallen seems to indicate that the whole aspect has
changed. Something about how things are now
would have been much more valuable than how they
were six months ago; possibly the chairman had
something to say on this point at the meeting, a
report of which should come by next mail.
Owing to reduced circumstances Brown
Hill Extended (W.A.) has cut down administration
exes, to under £5OO a year, and is still satisfied
to let tributors get what they ' can out of its now
almost worked-out Kalgoorlie property. Last year
the co. netted £3BO in royalty, and receipts for
1914 will probably work out about the same. Some
time ago the Boafd put monev into the Benu syndi-
cate, but this investment now appears in the
accounts as valueless. In view of this loss the
directors are chary about risking the balance of
the co.’s savings. An effort was made recently to
dispose of most of the machincrv and plant at
Kalgoorlie, but it was found that secondhand
machinery was only saleable there at a big sacrifice.
Preliminary sampling having been up to
the mark, Great Fingall has taken a nine months’
working option on the Eclipse leases at the Pinnacles,
near Cue (W.A.). Several small crushings have
been obtained by the owners, and the h ingall is
getting ready to see how the reef shapes at depth.
Yuanmi (W.A.) announces in its quarterly
report that a slight extension of ore reserves was
exposed in the Yuanmi leases, and the prospect ot
opening up further supplies is remote. As regards
sulphides the report claims that the work done
generally confirmed the reserves figured upon, but
in rising an irregular distribution of values was dis-
closed. Unfortunately the co. has not a very cheer-
ful tale to tell about its other show, the Oroya
Black Range. Recent development has failed to dis-
close any additional payable ore, and work has been
discontinued, while stoping has been restricted
owing to the dearth of good ore. By treating
accumulated slimes the management hopes to work
the mine at a small profit for some time to come,
and meantime an effort is being made to let tributes
and try to get in a bit of extra revenue that way.
Most of the stuff talked about Mount
Oxide has nothing to do with the case ; it refers to
share-dealing transactions in which the co. wasn t
concerned at all. There either have been 01 aie
three Oxide cos. The original Options merged into
the Mount Oxide Mines, Ltd., known as the Aus-
tralian co. The latter gave an optics to a London
syndicate on the most uncommon condition that the
Australian co. should do the work during the option
period. The London crowd lent money for this pur-
pose, apparently on mixed security—some of it the
co.’s, some of it otherwise. It is apparently to make
good this advance that the shareholders are asked to
pay up Is. 4d. per share. They can’t be compelled
to pay, the shares being fully paid. In other words,
no formal call can be made. But if they don t pay
and the money is really owing, then some ot the
170,000 shares which the Australian co. is to get
in the new London co. will have to be sold to meet
the obligation, and the shareholders in the Australian
eo. will then get less than share for share. The
accounts, which have been called for will perhaps
show whether the money is really owing or not. I he
London co., in which the old Oxide shareholders will
presently get scrip, will have .£150,000 of cash
capital to do something with. The whole business
lias been grotesquely muddled, and it is almost im-
possible to sort out the co.’s transactions and negotia-
tions from those of individuals who were heavily in-
terested in the eo. : but the foregoing is apparently
what it all boils down to, so far as the Australian
co. is concerned. As the Court has now ordered
compulsory liquidation some more daylight will, no
doubt, be let in. #
An option to purchase applications for the
White Cat and Black Cat leases at Atherton (Q.)
has got into the hands of a voluminous Melbourne
syndicate in Alex. Peacock’s office. These people
pass the thing on for the modest return of 200 shares
paid up to £lo—not a bad lump to pay for an
application. Vendors are allotted 50 shares paid up
to £2O each. Then, too, the co. has to bear a
vendor charge of £lOO in cash, apart from another
£2OO to come out of the mine products. Molybden-
ite is to be chased in the two Catteries, and as that
mineral is shy it will be of interest to see how far
the cash goes! In all. 150 shares are being taken by
subscribers at £lO each to carry the promoting water
and consideration. Fortunately, perhaps, the leases
cover only 10 acres, so there isn’t much to hunt over.
B. 11. Block 10’s option over the Ivula-
madau is for three months. Terms are £6OOO cash
and a quarter interest in a new co. Kulamadau
paid a. few 3d. dividends years ago. It is equipped
with three Huntingdon mills and a cyanide plant. A
recent return from 1976 tons stone and 10a0 tons
tailings was £2450. The old Woodlark Island Prop,
mire is now included with the Kulamadau.
Charters Towers feels better on the
strength of a new discovery in the Bonnie Dundee,
which has been crosscutting into iootvvall country at
the 1585 ft. level, and has at last met a reef showing
gold. The Bonnie only recently made a 3d call
( £1500), so the revival of the market will help the
directors to get calls in. If the reef proves identical
with that worked some years ago by Marshall's
Queen, development may lead to something really
good.
Hansel Mundy is the name of the Bendigo
mine in which the Adelaide Chaffinch crowd have been
trying to get back some of the cash lost over the
Bullfinch boom. So far, Bendigo hasn’t come out
any better than Westralia. The co. has seen lots of
quartz and a few colors at the Hansel, but these can
be got anywhere at Bendigo. At 580 ft. the west
crosscut got into centre country, where the lava
shows with a nice make of quartz, which is to be
followed to the north. The programme also is to
try out east at 484 ft., where runs of stone exist.
Adelaide capital therefore is going solidly in genuine
mining at a spot Bendigonians have always neglected,
though they turn the Crow-eaters on to the line as
the best prospecting patch within a couple of miles
of Pall Mall.
Needle pyrites in the dyke and the reef at
Walhalla have generally been the signs of good gold
in the Long Tunnel and old Extended mines. So
loud crowing is heard because they show up at 3506 ft.
after a blank of hundreds of feet. In the upper sec-
tion of Cohen’s reef the gold carried down in two
main seams, but with the roll in the country and
the cutting away of the quartz from the. dyke, these
seams disappeared, and the mine became unpayable.
The face at 3500 ft. is now 25ft. from the winze sunk
from 3275 ft., which carried pay dirt down 100 ft.
There are other winzes farther along the 3275 ft. level
in decent grade stone. These will be shaved down as
hard as the cash available will let them go, and, if
they respond, a big block of ground will be ready
for'Jock Finlayson to stope.
* * * *
Officially the present Lord Nelson Co.. St.
Arnaud, is dead ; but the last rites are being per-
formed in what a fluent pen describes as easy stages.
This is to let the St. Arnaud shopkeepers get their
new co. going. If they don’t, the plant will be
brought under the hammer for the purpose of collect-
ing a final liquidation div. The financial position of
the old co. at June 30 wasn’t helped by the six
months’ work. Total receipts from 9753 tons quartz,
2250 tons sand and 16,378 tons slimes were only
£13,566, and as it cost £13,823 to earn the money,
a slight debit has to go to profit and loss. The co.
owes its banker £1339, and has £1945 of liquid
assets besides any little odds and ends that may be
about the battery or in the stopes. The new co., there-
fore, has to make a new mine after the clean sweep
by the present Board.
The first clean-up of the Tasmania Mine,
Beaconsfield, now the refuge of the tribute-hunter,
is ghastly: Gold, 5500 z., worth £1980; concentrates
and plates, £1247 ; total, £3227. The outgo was
£4026, of which £1750 was for coal and £l7Ol
for rent and treatment. The loss is thus £799.
It is claimed, of course, that this is not a fair
start, as dead work had to be done and heavy
pumping. Those always were incidentals at the
Tasmania. Anyway, the State puts up £lOOO to
go on with. If the miners cannot mane a do, the
Government will decide this month whether the
prospects are worth powder and shot; it they_ ctont
look good enough the men will get a lift to Broke
Hill or Mount Lyell, where they can make good
monei'. *

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 27, 1914.
My Dear Akint,—
The Ilieland Society’s welcome to the
Miami Ferguson and his lady occurred in
our Town Barn. This was handsomely
spread with red carpet and hung with bunt-
ing for the event. The usually desolate
area of choir seats was shaded with gigantic
palms, and the only dislocation in the decora-
tions was immediately overhead. Scores of
shabby little pointed tags of bunting, that
looked like the washing of an infants’ school
hanging on several backyard lines, draggled
in the full blaze of the electric lights, that
make an ordinary complexion appear sea-
green, and turn the banners of yesteryear
into a second-hand rag display.
The Chiel himsel’—M. Ferguson—ad-
vanced with martial pomp in the modern
combination of ancient kilts, laundered even-
ing shirt (1914 vintage) and dinner jacket,
behind a wild skirl of the bagpipes, headed
by a vast drum or pipe major, under a foot
or two of auld Glenlivet busby. Walking
backwards up the centre strip of carpet, the
McSamson shook a long, nlated wand. The
faster he tossed it in the air the louder
brayed the Celtic pipes. Excellency Helen,
Governor Strickland and Eldest Daughter
Mary (her corn-colored locks banked up in
soft curls against her pretty head), the So-
ciety’s president, James Burns, M.L.C., and
understudy Dugald Thomson, from Cromarty
or thereabouts, with a selection from the
A.D.C. department; stepped up the hall m
great majesty to the sub-regal square of
Axminster. Prof. Andy Stuart, in mere
Sassenach swallow tails, and the tall Scot,
Currie Ellis, bandaged all over in a dark-
green tartan, with a jewelled dirk and other
glittering toys stuck about his person, were
near by. G.-G. M. Ferguson was much the
best speaker at this thistle rally, and raised
his voice above the Town Hall echoes, which
usually lie in waiting for strange orators, lie
incidentally assured the company that he had
arrived without a broken bone, having negoti-
ated the Parramatta-road boulders, from
Yaralla, at the rate of eight miles an hour, in
a car specially constructed to plough its way
through ordinary bush at 20 miles an hour.
A musical programme added to the gaiety
of nations, and diverted people’s thoughts
from the impending war.
Governor Strickland’s new Help (an extra)
Wakeman is a Lieutenant in the Grenadier
Guards reserve staff, and is the eldest son
of a British baronet named Offley Wakeman.
Offley, junior, stands about sft. 30in. when
he is in his carpet slippers. He is in
affluent circumstances, and is still open for
engagement.
Hockey for wet feet—l mean for women
—was lately played on sodden, slippery
grass at Rushcutter’s Bay. In spite of a
pale, frosty-looking sun shining on Friday’s
match, hundreds of spectators stood on
ground that was like a wot sponge, though
they had recklessly paid Is. 6d. apiece to
sit down. A few seats that strayed up close
to the sports’ oval held about 10 per cent,
of those present. In the distance the alleged
grandstand, which might be the Tower of
I.ondon, so far as anyone ever yearns to sit
on its remote boards, was, as usual, empty.
The English women played a fast and
clever game against an All Australia hockey
team, galloping away with 11 goals to mu-
girls’ two successful shots at the Red Skirts’
netted fastness. This was vigorously de-
fended by a determined-looking British female
who was more or less shrouded in leggings.
Her name, I believe, was Boadicea. There
was lots of slipping and butting over the
ball on both sides, b.ut our girls got too
excited in vital moments. The wild rush of
an Australian damsel at the goal and the
Britannia in front, and the sudden embrace
of both, astounded Elizabeth Tudor, the
Lady of the Leggings, and lost a goal. On
our side hockey girls De Laine, Warden and
Meares made gallant attempts to outrun the
British boot, which is seven-leagued. Red
Skirts (English) S. Wcatherell. M. Lea-
croft, C. Gaskell and M. Eames played like
perfect gentlemen.
New Caledonia’s Governor Brunet calls
at this waterfront on July 31 on his way
to France. Mrs. Brunet will unpack her
frills on that date for a series of tea parties.
Governor Strickland is going to dine the
Iravellers at State Government villa on
August 1. On the 3rd the N.S.W. Government
will lay the festive knife and fork in
honor of Brunet at midday. Probably
Parliament House will resound with the
oratory that surrounds a snack of this kind.
Premier Holman had a good deal of hos-
pitality from the Brunets during a visit
to the Isle of Cells about two years ago.
Hence the desire to retaliate in kind. The
French Governor and his Madame- stay
under file Strickland roof during their brief
residence hereabouts.
Last week thousands of sightseers went,
by way of a happy hour, to see Darlinghurst
Gaol. This old Place of Misery, or its site,
will blossom or bud in the future into a
Girls’ High School. Not to be defrauded of
the full extent of their sensations of joy, many
of the visitors not only stood on the gallows
platform, but gleefully had their photos
taken on the spot where much humanity,
blindfolded, has bounded into Eternity.
There is no accounting for the frenzied
ideals of pleasure that throb in the human
breast. Hundreds of women, who are not
paid to do it, will cheerfully swelter in a
room large enough to hold half their number,
in the fond delusion that they are meeting
a Personage who has been caught on pur-
pose. They are really meeting their own
suburb, and staring steadfastly at the Per-
sonage over the edge of their teacups. She
is unable to recognise the line shades of
difference in caste that divide one part of
Potts Point from the other side of the street,
and is merely concerned at the innumerable
hats that block the air. Still, nearly every-
one says that it is a most brilliant affair,
so somebody must be honestly entertained at
such parties.
Mrs. Mayoress Richards had a great
assembly of July millinery in her official
rooms the other afternoon, to greet Lady
Helen M. Ferguson. Her Ex. is tall enough
to look over the feathers of even the medium-
sized woman, and she could breathe freely
above the feminine crowd. This was like a
scrum on the muddied football field, when
the rooms seemed to be three sizes too small
for the company. Private Secretary Ltit-
trell was in attendance. He is a tall, pale
young man with sleek locks and nicely-
groomed manners, and he carefully supported
himself against the wattle-trimmed mantel-
piece (W. G. Layton’s best effort for that
afternoon), and graciously permitted two or
three good-looking young matrons to purr
round his lofty brow. Before the At Home
was finished P.C. Luttrell had the dazed ex-
pression of something that had been mar-
ooned on an island of female Hat.
The afternoon being wet and cold, half the
company had dashed hurriedly up the muni-
cipal staircase, with rugs to its ears. Hav-
ing no place whereon to hang its numerous
coats, unless it desperately flung them on
the lone Private Secretary, it went violently
purple in the face as the cubic space grew
less. Miss Strickland, garbed in blue, was
in the surging throng. The Anderson Stuart
dame’s saucy plateau hat, rose-wreathed, got
next to others of the same sharp-edged
species, without any casualties. The bright-
eved young Blackwood lady, under the airy
nothingness of a black tulle frill or so on her
head, went up to the stranded Private Secre-
tary now and again, and seemed to speak
words of cheer in its lonely ear. Miss
Eadith Walker’s wintry leopard-skin cape-
coat, with the fashionable bag or sag in its
heavy folds, was tied round the neck with
some other kind of fur. A black straw ring-a-
rosy spring hat was the frivolous terminus to
the leopard’s pelt. Only a millionairess would
have the courage to mix her seasons like
this.
Mrs. Baronet Cooper is bestirring herself
with much zeal over the October Dolls’ Carni-
val ball. This silly title is the prefix that
polkas before a charity show that proposes
lo take place in the Town Hall early in
October. Results go to the Alexandra
Hospital for children.
Prof. Grafton Smith, who is ahead of the
British Scientists’ pilgrimage here, has been
talking about mummies and other dusty
Egyptians in great stone sarcophagus or
hall of Sydney ’Varsity. Like many learned
■men, the brilliant Australian is not a show-
man lecturer. He drops his voice, and chats
in an undertone to his mummy ladies on the
lantern slides, and occasionally seems as far
away from his audience as the valley beyond
Thebes. In his most audible moments the
informative Smith told us that Woman had
been plaiting her hair in much the same
style (I thought Professors never noticed
these things) for uncounted centuries, and
the Egyptian flapper of the one-and-a-halfth
dynasty—the one that flourished when Adam
was a tadpole—was identical in her thatch
with the 20th-century flapper of Park-lane,
London, or the modern Nubian flapper of the
Upper Nile. No doubt the very earlv
Egyptian belle plaited other ladies’ ‘ hair, if
she ran out of her own, or found it came
out in handfuls when she brushed it with a
brick. But the lecturer was too polite to
mention this detail.
W. M. Jones, this year’s Rhodes scholar
for Maoriland, arrived here the other day, on
his way to Oxford.
Mrs. Percy Colquhoun, wife of the well-
known solicitor, died the other day. She
used to be Miss Mabel Shaw, of Strathfield.
The popular pair were Mosman residents,
and he is a tennis player of considerably
more than local note.
Mrs. Carroll, widow of Dr. Alan Carroll,
of Child Study note, goes to England in the
£Eneas. The Blue Funnel craft shoves its
nose into green seas to-day (Monday). Mrs.
Carroll, who perpetuates the memory of her
husband in Good Works, handed over £lOOO
last week to a ward in the Renwick Hos-
pital for sick babes. This is to be called
the Alan Carroll Ward. The good citizen-
ess is a daughter of the late William Doug-
las, M.L.C., in Maoriland, where he owned a
slice of the earth at Taurangi—the Mount
St. John estate —and elsewhere in the North
Island. Mrs. Carroll is going to make a
special study of the treatment of child-life
in Europe during the next two years.
After all, the deal in a Norfolk Island
coffee plantation, between the owner, R. S.
Waterhouse, and the local Turkish coffee
expert, Mockbell. fell through, or bumped
on something. So Mr. Waterhouse hies him
home with his wife to Palm Glen (N. 1.) in
the Makambo this week. He is a son of a
late N.S.W. Wesleyan parson, who was a
shepherd in the missionary business here
many years since. While the Waterhouses
were here they camped under the roof of
their son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs.
W. R. Blow, at Mosman.
Dunedin’s eye and ear specialist, Dr. Undo
Ferguson, is holidaying here.
On August 4 the Alliance Fraucaise will
hold its last social gathering this season, in
St. James’s llall. You will., therefore, have
a final opportunity of taking your French
conversation out of moth balls. Mrs. Louise
Leverrier is president of this year’s Alliance
and all its ways. Little Mrs. George Earp is
going to warble at the forthcoming Sydney
sur Seine gathering. The youthful Madeline
Collins will also uplift her impressive tones.
Mrs. Chauvin —who used to be Yvonne
Leverrier —at the piano, and other entente
cordiale performers, are going to give the
company quite ss. worth of Paris accent for
2s. Gd. There will be no discount for prompt
cash. *
The Theatre League of N.S.W., which is
so new that you can smell wet paint, pro-
duced Iladdon Chambers’ recent play, “Sir
Anthony,” at the Repertory Theatre. As a
curtain-raiser the late Thomas Spencer’s
“Mrs. Maloney’s Boarders” took the first
chill off the proceedings. But Mrs. Maloney
and her boarders are better by their own
firesides these winter nights, for they make
very cold comedy.
“Sir Anthony” trips briskly through three
acts round the follies of a London clerk
named Clarence Chops, who travelled from
Suburbia to the States, with a British Bart,
on the same boat. Complications and snubs
follow. Ellis Trougliton, a Sydney youth
who belongs to the N.S.W. Ryrie clan, was
unusually un-amateurish as Clarence. He
played like an experienced pro. with far more
vim than some of the Williamson importa-
tions in juvenile lead. J. Manchester, Gil-
bert Gurney and Violet Haldane (an excel-
lent Emily-London-slavey-of-all-work) are
highly commended. Miss Helen Hudson is
press agent of the freshly varnished League,
which will seize your smallest contribution
with both hands. The notion of producing
Australian companies in Australian authors’
plays is not new, but it deserves encourage-
ment. The orchestra was young and vehem-
ent, and bursting with enthusiasm and loud
noises. If it _ will kindly burst in tune and
keep off Tosti’s “Good-bye” all will be for-
given.
Tien Hogue, a good-looking Sydney girl,
with a honey-sweet speaking voice, goes off
in a branch line of “Within the Law,” the
exciting drama which is to play Australian
'country towns. This co. gets into business
at Maitland on August 4. Miss Hogue is
to be the Aggie Lynch of the new team.
This damsel gave such an intelligent reading
of the part of Victoria Chops in “Sir An-
thony,” at the Repertory Theatre, that she is
likely to prove a bright addition to the
native-born stage contingent.
Miss Eva O’Sullivan, daughter of the late
E. V . of kindly memory, is holidaying round
Banna and adjacent sunburnt isles. She
met Beatrice Grimshaw in Moresby, lunched
with the Deputy-Administrator, and was off
Woodlark Island when she enthused about
Samarai on a postcard.
The assertion that Sydney people have the
picnic habit so badly that they seldom go to
church—as they understand the church busi-
ness in Adelaide, for instance —must emanate
from derelict clerics who can’t get anything
except the verger and a stray dog to*listen
to their exhortations, and put a dry bone in
the plate. Parsons of any shade in theol-
ogy, who know their job, could put up
“standing room only” notices every Sunday
evening, in this “wicked” city. According
to a friend from the highlands of Peebles, the
Reverend Duncan, a big gun in the faith,
recently in charge of John Ferguson’s kirk in
Phillip-street, could fill a church twice the
size of the old building he had the loan of.
Parson George Duncan moves on to Montreal
this week. There, the Canadian mountaineers
from the kilts of Dumfries, are building him
a kirk the size of a clan, or a clachan, or
something. St. Mary’s (R.C.) Cathedral is
so congested for space that its authorities are
kicking up a lot of dust on an adjacent plot
of land, in order to house the faithful in a
more roomy edifice. When Carr-Smith was
in charge of St. James’s Anglican chapel in
King-street, the devout used to rush off to
the evening rally, still munching their meal,
so as to get early doors’ admission and
avoid the crush. If churchgoing be a sign
of Great Goodness, Sydney will contribute
thousands of halos when St. Peter is round-
ing up for the Last Muster.
Paul Dufault has been petting a little cold
with such success that on Saturday nignr
when the same old rain was pelting on the
Town llall roof, his remarkable tenor was
full of sunshine. As a voice it has become
much rounder and more resonant since th-
owner of it took so kindly to applause at this
corner of the globe. The Australian climate
which, after three years’ residence in Sydney
changed Zanelli’s baritone to a tenor (he joy-
fully trotted the said tenor off to Paris) is
again responsible. Dufault’s silvery coiffure
kept its front locks in curl, in spite of the
damp weather, and he had a big audience to
encore his alluring warble; so all was well.
Pauline Bindley, the young Victorian
soprano, has a bird-like trill that is going
to perform wonderful vocal gymnastics some-
day. Just now she is a promising student
with a good many scales and exercises ahead
of her. Ernest Toy, behind the iiddle, was
very suave and sweet in the Schuhert-
Wilhelmj “Ave Maria.”
The Hon. Billy Grosvenor, eldest son of
Lord Henry of that ilk, is on the training-
ship Medway under the _ skipper’s jurisdic-
tion, on a world tour of great green seas.
He is a tall, fair-haired spectacled youth
of 19, rather more careless about his clothes
than the Australian nipper of 10 or 12 tree-
climbing summers. Young Grosvenor went
to the last polo match with a chaperon who
hails from a Parramatta River suburb, and
chortled loudly over the “jolly good riding
of Australians-—what?” Local Society",
which can’t be expected to know junior
sprigs of the Peerage unless they’re labelled
in headlines, looked rather disgusted as the
Hon. Billy’s unpolished boots and untidy
rigout passed by their exclusive noses. This
happy-go-lucky youth has a sporting chance
of being Duke of Westminster, though the
odds are still against him. He is brother
of the Dorothy Grosvenor who married
Rosebery’s heir, Dalmeny.
The Nurses’ Club Bali comes off on Aug-
ust 20, in the Salon de Luxe. Tickets are
10s. 6d., and visitors can be in plain or
fancy garb as they please. Mrs. Joseph
Carrutliers is president of the ball commit-
tee. Mrs. Arthur Deery, who is a strong-
help in time of charity hons, Mrs. Vincent
McCauley, Miss Ellis and Miss MacPherson
are arranging fancy sets, and the tango will
kick up its heels in a special full-dress
demonstration. Hon. secs. Miss M. Neil
O’Connell and Miss Hilda Cox are thrashing
out details at the point of the pen.
11. N. Southwell writes from Paris, and
dates his letter June 22. He was there as
an Australian delegate to the Olympic Con-
gress which folded in about 200 representa-
tives of 32 nations. Furious debates as to
whether women should be allowed to do
their little bit in swimming or boxing were
followed by smiles all round, mostly at the
jokes of the President, Baron de Coubertin.
France, America and Japan, in the persons
of their reps., consistently united in opposing
Our admission to the proposed skating, ten-
nis, swimming and fencing with foils compe-
tition. Feminine boxing was then hurled at
the company as a presidential jest. The
other nations were too strong for the triplet
against Us—so woman trill be included in
the 1916 Olympic sports. How odd that
Uncle Sam should have tried to slam the
starting gate in the face of female competi-
tion, by the way ! The old maids from New
England—the Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah
that Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote
about (it was the latter who danced with
Uncle Fliakim) —-will have something to say
on this matter.
Ruth Bannister, our young wood sculp-
tress now in London, has had all kinds of
flattering adjectives turned on to her work
by quite two queens and as many as several
duchesses. Ruth didn’t get through the
gate of Buckingham Palace or the
portal of Marlborough House without some
inquiries from the police. Anything in petti-
coats with a large parcel is now likely to
be arrested as a militant female with a bomb
in her underskirt. So the Sydney girl
waved a permit in the scared face of a sentrv
before she was hustled along palatial cor'-i-
-dors from set to set of Yellow Plush vassals,
and from the Jeames Calves who lurked heir
to the Thomas Calves who lurked there.
Finally, after passing the scrutiny of the
Chamberlain, the Almoner, the Petty Bag.,
the Remembrancer, the Grand Falconer, the-
Receiver, the Steward and Clerk of Halmotes:
for the County Palatine of Durham, the
Assistant Keeper, the Financial Adviser and!
Actuary, and the Elder Brethren of Trinity
House, she scurried past the Inspector Under
Canal Boats Act and reached the presence
of Miss Knollys, a neat little figure in
black, who passed the work on to the Queen.
(I forget which Queen, but both Majesty
Mary and ex-Majesty Alexandra admired the
carved panels with many adjectives). Then
came the return to the outer world. “When
I reached the final footman he asked if he
might call a cab for me,” says Ruth. “I
told him I had a taxi waiting. ‘Oh. that’s
a pity,’ said this Splendid Apparition, ‘it
does run the price up so.’ ”
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Hundreds of riders bear testimony to the superiority of this splendid machine.
Writing from .Singleton on July 17, Mr. It. J. Ivnodler says:—
“It affords me much pleasure to write you about my New Hudson
4h.p. Motor Cycle, purchased from you six weeks ago. Since pur-
chasing 1 have done live hundred miles or more with side cars, and
over some of the roughest roads in the district, and so far I have
never met a hill which I could not take with a twelve-stone passenger
in the side car. The gears (Armstrong) are really a pleasure to
manipulate, and a great boon to traffic driving and hill climbing. In
short, the New Hudson is THE machine for Side Car or solo work, or
the ‘go anywhere and pull anything' Motor Cycle. Wishing you every
success in the Motor Trade.”
This testimony confirms the statement that the New Hudson is perfect in design,
construction and equipment.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 27, 3914.
My Dear Yarkie,—
The Boulevard (a Bohemian underground
resort in Collins-street) burst into uncon-
ventional revelry last week. An old-time
geographer wrote once that, in the regions
beyond Astomia there dwell beings who live
on the scent of the rose. Our local Bo-
hemians went considerably better than this.
Not only was the scent of the rose notice-
able at their feast, but also that of the
onion and the eschalot and the garlic herb.
The hiss of falling beer mingled merrily with
the shuffling of the eager waiters’ feet, giving
a very fair idea, when all was said and
done, of a banquet in the time of Sardan-
apalus. And all at five shillings a head. lam
told that the menus were printed in Braille
characters —a device which, as none will
know better than you, my dear, makes it
possible for the very blindest to read. This
gives you some idea of the thoughtfulness of
the organisers of the festivity. I don’t pre-
tend to speak from personal experience, as
the Bohemians were so exclusive 'that no
one hailing from any other part of the
social Balkans was able to get in. My in-
formation was garnered from a trusty
waiter, lie told me, furthermore, by the way,
that several of these convention-spurning
citizens appeared in fancy dresses con-
trived out of kerosene tins and table-covers;
also that some miserable Philistines who
had not booked tables in advance and
received the countersign for the evening,
howled unavailingly for admittance at the
door during about half the proceedings.
Had I been there 1 think I would either have
let them in or poured boiling water over
them.
A day or so ago Mrs. Rubber Edwards
took her two schoolboy sons and all the Mel-
bourne Grammar Preparatory School boys
to see a printing factory at work. They
were conveyed to the printery in taxis, and
were rushed back to a bun-fight at the Ori-
ental Hotel. Need 1 say that the lads
acquitted themselves after the manner of
heroes, and that the wretched bun's .were
mowed down like wheat before the sickle?
The Melbourne bun has not had a worse
time since the last Church Congress
assembled here.
Esperantists in Melbourne are going to
have a fancy-dress ball. It is expected
that the language will be something awful.
The committee aims at making this func-
tion (which will happen at the Turn Verein
on August IS) the equal of the famous old
affair in the Tower of Babel.
Talking of Esperanto, Mr. Webber (Mel-
bourne’s youngest Muse. Bach.) and Mr.
Hyde are to represent Australia at the Paris
Congress in August. Already 3000 people
from odd corners of the globe have paid
their preparatory fees for this congress.
This musical Webber has had a comedy
played by the Paris Esperantists—in his own
bad language, of course.
Walter Kirby warbled beautifully through
a special recital last week. The only
available Governor (Stanley) was there.
An intrepid aide shielded him from >the pos-
sible violence of disloyalists. As against
this there were no duchesses —at least, if
there were, they eluded my notice. Hence
a certain melancholy on the part of Kirby.
It is understood that he can rarely do his
best without at least one duchess in the
room. He got the habit in England, where
duchesses are prepared to go to dreadful
olaces like Mai da Yale and Kennington to
hear him. He shines most, as we all know,
in the presence of queens. Walter is a per-
fect whale on queens. And, of course, they
get absolutely, blithering about him. He
wears Queen Margharita’s jewelled favor on
his coat lapel, as another might the metalled
season-ticket of a suburban railway.
But this is getting right away from
Kirby’s voice, which he pushed most melodi-
ously through a forest of moustachios on
the occasion under notice. He was in sen-
timental mood, and, as a result, the pro-
gramme was torn between love songs and
melancholy ditties such as “The Suicide’s
Grave,” “The Maniac’s Shroud” and so on.
The encores were both numerous and yearn-
ing. Pianist Natalie Dawson, plump and
bedizened with rose-chiffon, gold-tissue and
lace, trilled out the accompaniments. Barker,
going grey in his devotion to the liar]),
harped with much art. He has been harp-
ing in Melbourne at intervals since his
boyhood, and before that he did minstrel
work for an early British king. A very
young singer, named Wynne Macoboy, ex-
hibited a big contralto voice which apparently
rather frightens its owner at present. She
is fair and slim and good-looking and
probably has a future.
The house was large and enthusiastic.
Kirby got successively a laurel wreath, a
wattle wreath and a posy of violets. When
a hamper of food—chocolates or something—
was handed up by a misguided adorer, he
began to get seriously annoyed. And yet he
looks as though his inner being really loved
food. You can’t help thinking that chicken
is the nourishment of his soul. Or roast
duck.
Amongst the sharp showers of music that
always distinguish this time of year, one
may note the special concert in the Masonic
Hall to baritone George Cowley. His is
yet another of those voices which unceas-
ingly go abroad for ploughing, harrowing
and cultivation generally. Several import-
ant people helped. Maggie Stirling was
impressive. Amadio tootled like Pan on his
flute-pipes. Murray Lucas and Pose Alba
also sang. The principal baritone warbled
items by a local composer. Miss Mabel Down,
whose songs were as feathery as you might
expect. He also sang Bralim's “Mainacht.”
Leigh Falkiner, of Boonooke, who bought
Radnor, has been stocking his racing stables
considerably of late. Why? What did
Louis Quatorze do when he first fell in love
with Madame do Montespan? lie improved
\ ersailles. I say no more. You can draw
your own deductions, merely setting aside
tor me the customary tipster's commission if
1 prove to be right. 1 would not be the
judicial-minded fiiend which you know me
for did I not mention, in passing, that the
newly-born Falkiner activity may have
another and entirely different signification.
-In-brief, it may mean that nothing is further
from the thoughts of the last, lone bachelor
of- this- affluent squatting clan than mar-
riage. What saith the perceptive Bacon?
“Matrimony is an impediment to great enter-
prises.” I don’t remember at the moment
if Bacon was a racing man. though we a!l
know that he spent some years in gaol. But
anyhow he would certainly have placed
racing under the heading “great enterprises,”
being a sensible man for a philosopher.
Which all goes to show how unsatisfactory
these signs and portents and omens are. She
is said, by the way. to hail from Toorak.
For the moment I can't tell you who it is
that is to marry Sydney Letts, of Ilokianga,
but I’m assured that it isn’t Jessie Binnie,
of the Chevy Chase Binnies, of Brighton.
There is only one Jessie in that family, and
xhc was comfortably settled with a husband
years ago. In the circumstances I’d better
withdraw Letts too. It seems cruel to
engage him to nobody in particular.
The Melbourne Repertory Theatre Club
Ball has issued its balance-sheet. Lawyer
Marshal Lyle mentions that £524 was raked
in, and of it £270 went in provisions, the
cup that both cheers and inebriates, and
necessary expenses generally. I think that
if ever my literary genius threatens to play
me false I shall take to ball-promoting. There
seems to be nearly as much money in it as in
fight-promoting.
Mary Stirling, the dimpled young daughter
of Maggie Stirling, is giving a recital this
week end. Governor Stanley and his lady
have promised to turn up to hearken to
gentle Mary for the manyth time.
Ida Lockington, daughter of the Harry
Lockingtons, of Rockingham. Elsternwiek.
was booked to marry Joseph Howie, of South
Yarra. in London, on Saturday last. Failing-
earthquake, famine, the -Vet of God, inva-
sion. strike on the part of the clergy,
flood, revolution and the suffragettes, the
ceremony has doubtless already come off.
However, at the time of writing his anxious
relatives in this city had heard nothing of
it.
The Federal Gentlemen Helps have not
been idle while their leader has been away
preventing the Empire from bursting in Syd-
ney. On the contrary. With a dogged reso-
lution and an attention to duty which was
surpassed neither by Burke nor by Wills
they have employed themselves spreading
abroad a vast acreage of paste-board asking
practically all Melbourne that has not, so
far, been to gaol, to a party at Government
House. The festivity will transpire on
Thursday, August 13, and the British Science
Association delegates are to be the guests of
honor.
The latest fashion craze is to attach a
watch to one’s neck with a black watered
silk ribbon. If you don’t happen to have a
watch, or if the article has been temporarily
hypothecated, a brick will do as well, or even
a piece of coal or an old iron bolt. The
great thing is to have the watered silk rib-
bon. The vogue dates from the era when
our grandmothers were hitting things up,
and it. is connected indirectly with the new
style in dancing. So many grandmothers
have taken to the tango that they are in a
position to dictate the fashions in the matter
of neckwear, and so on. Where, I often
ask. is this octogenarian frivolity going to
end ?
Mrs. Robb has been electioneering round
Bendigo, Castleinaine and Maldon on behalf
of her son, Maldon, who is the Fusion can-
didate for Bendigo. Maldon, who is, or was,
in the clergy business, “put up” for the dis-
trict of Brunswick and thereabouts at last
Federal election and scored very well for a
beginner. [Signed in accordance with the
Electoral Act by my informant Elvira
Gummidve, A.W.N.L., L.O.L. (Derry Grand-
aunts’ No Surrender Lodge, No. 56),
A.P.D.A. and Y.W.C.A., Melb., Vic.]
A girl writes me from London concerning
the Marshall Hall opera first night. The
Fred Ilenriques pair were there from Mel-
bourne ; also Mrs. Shelton, who is what one
might term a vice-regality four or five times
removed —she is the widow of a nephew of
an ex-Governor of Westralia. Mrs.
Manny Phillips took part in the performance.
One of the stall’s audience was Frank
Staines, formerly of the Winter Tea Garden,
a slender Melbourne youth who carried a
kitchen invention abroad and has now waxed
prosperous on the royalties.
Ethel Castilla, of these parts, has just
published a volume of poems in London.
There'is natural excitement over the matter
in the old city, but the police are understood
to be keeping the populace under with the
white cotton glove that conceals a hand like
a cold shoulder of lamb.
And now for a dash of mystery. A
local Society Girl—no bogus aristocrat, mark
you, but oue of the genuine old-vintage-year
order —recently got engaged to an English-
man. The trousseau was bought at vast
expense. Congratulations poured in. Sev-
eral local youths talked vaguely about cut-
ting their throats, but managed in the end
to resist the impulse. The maiden left for
England and the altar. Now she is back
again, and still unmarried. The alliance is
off. As to the reasons she preserves a pro-
voking silence, but they are understood to
be bound up with certain discoveries auent
the Britisher’s Past. Her life, however, is
not utterly blighted. In fact, she has just
got engaged again—this time to a Melbourne
man with a Past that would not disgrace a
rural dean. I don’t know if you ever dredge
any meaning out of these Eleusinian or jig-
saw paragraphs of mine, my dear —probably
not. But the impulse to write them grows
overwhelmingly strong from time to time.
Julius Superbus is due to pay us another
farewell visit (I am not sure if the coming
farewell will be his 64th or his 67th) next
month. He will say good-bye this time at
the Theatre Royal in “A Royal Divorce.”
This is a departure from custom, more or
less, his valedictories being usually exe-
cuted in “Beaucaire.” But who cares, so
long as his lovely legs remain among us?
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Tile Point-to-Point Steeplechase, on Saturday, was
won by Mr. Teesdale Smith on Douree. The Gov-
ernor, aided by Captain Fletcher, motored down and
then joined the President, Mr. 11. D. Young, on his
drag. Most of the hunting enthusiasts turned up at
the marquee in time for tea. I observed among the
refreshment-punishers the Luxmores, the McCulloehs,
the J. A. G. Hamiltons, Mrs. R. Colley (who, by the
way, had the bad luck to be relieved of most of her
jewellery by an enterprising burglar the other day),
the Alfred Stokes, Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Bell, the IV.
Popes, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Levi, the Leonard Bake-
wells and their daughter, Mr. and Mrs. John Toll,
the Arthur Waterhouses (one of whose dauhgters
hunts regularly) and Mrs. Robert Rymill.
To-morrow Justice J. 11. Gordon will be 64. He
was born in Scotland in 1850, and called to the
South Australian Bar when he was 26. He spent 15
years in the State Parliament, and in that time held
portfolios in the Holder, Cockburn, Kingston and
Jenkins Ministries, lie got his judgeship in 1908.
lie is one of our most eloquent speakers—and not as
Mr. King O’Malley is eloquent either.
Captain Fletcher left by the Orama after a highly
successful career as an aide-de-camp. On Thursday
the secretaries of various local societies assembled
and said good-live to him, and gave him a walking-
stick and remarked that he was one of the best, aides
they ever met.
Miss Gladys Revnell, an Adelaide girl who has been
studying Art in Paris, writes a feverish explanation
of the Orpen picture. It appears (and here is where
a large section of the community breathes again)
that the black-clad male is not a parson. lie is
meant to represent an Irish peasant in his Sunday
clothes. But much else remains to be resolved, and
an atmosphere of uneasiness still persists.
Mrs. Charles Tennant, has left the Queen Adelaide
Club and is staying with Mrs. Davies Thomas at
Blackwood.
The Annual Children’s Fancy Dress Ball in aid
of the Children’s Hospital is billed for August 19,
in the Exhibition Building. The Mayor’s Ball will
be on the 11th.
The Queen’s School Old Scholars’ dance last night,
in the North Adelaide Institute, was the usual howl-
ing success. Mrs. Arthur Rymill attended to the
decorations, and a committee consisting of the head-
master and about 20 ex-scholars saw that the rest cf
the show was up to the old level. Among the guests
were almost everybody who counts.
Miss Carmen Delprat was presented with an At
Home at the Lister Hall on Tuesday afternon, bv
Mr. William Silver and Mr. Eugene Alderman. On
Wednesday night she gave a concert —and a very
good one too. And on Thursday' she left, with her
mother, for Melbourne. So you see she has not been
idle, as the little girl remarked in the well-known
anecdote.
There was another musical reception on Friday
evening, when the Adelaide Chamber Music Society
invited a good many people to meet Leonard Borwick
at the Cafe Rubeo.
Mielba arrived home on Sunday morning.
To say she was welcomed by a vast crowd
is to put the thing with miserable inade-
quacy. People literally maundered over her.
She might have been an insolvent who had
called a meeting of creditors in order to tell
them that they would all be paid in full,
with 10 per cent, added for anxiety and
mental wear and tear. Cheers split the wel-
kin and shook the incoming Adelaide express
to its foundations. For my own part I
burst into uncontrollable sobs.
Melba gathered armsful of flowers from
her friends, laughed delightedly, and re-
marked : “Goodness, it is great to be home
again!” even as the explorer Stanley re-
marked, on an equally notable occasion: “Dr.
Livingstone, I presume.” George Arm-
strong was there with his pretty, blue-eyed
wife. What a perfectly-garbed young man
he is, to be sure! He landed with his
august mother, wearing upon liis slim and
graceful form a lovely soft fawn coat. His
boots were perfection, and so, I feel sure,
were the rest of his garments, but they were
hidden from me. Melba wore sables and a
hard, glazed hat, with black and white rib-
bons. Her chauffeur, who came to meet
her, wore —but perhaps this inventory busi-
ness has gone far enough. She shook hands
with him in a way that denoted perfect trust
in the matter of tyre and repair bills, and
he deferentially helped her into a monster
’possum-skin motor coat.
Charlie Mitchell was in evidence, of course,
lie is very like her —same height, same
square shoulders and determined features.
Mrs. Lempriere’s fair hair looked lovely in
the sunlight. Mrs. Howe had a duck of a
motor hat for the occasion. Manager Lem-
mone. pianist Whittle and a big baritone
named McEacharn, who wears pince-nez on
an important nose, all moved about in a
helpful spirit, and got in each other’s way,
and assisted t<> block the traffic. It was a
great occasion and I am still suffering mildly
from the whirl and bustle and emotionalism
of it all.
Society tried hard to look surprised when
auburn-haired Belle White admitted that
Humor had not altogether lied in reference
to Percy Alderson and herself. Percy is a
well-tailored and sprightly Londoner, who
is here looking after the Melbourne office of
the P. and O. Co. He has just about arrived
at the July period of life. Miss White may
be said to be at the beginning of May.
The Heggie Weigalls have sent out cards
for the wedding of Neil Land) and Rita
Weigall on August 2(1. The last rites will
be performed at St. Mary’s at 2 p.m., and
sustaining victuals will be available after-
wards at Dacre. The Scottish Lamb is sec-
retary of the winey Burgoyne.
A charity worker who got up an advertise-
ment set for a recent ball is repenting bit-
terly of her energy. Many of the dancers
have omitted to return the costumes. They
have recklessly been guilty of larceny as
bailees of the garments. Think of it. To-
day an innocent, if idiotic-looking, reveller
in the sweet cause of Charity; to-morrow a
Criminal. Such, however, is Life. One
cavalier —quite married enough to know bet-
ter, by the way —presented his wooden shoes
as a memento to the girl with whom lie
motored home in the frosty dawn. This puts
her in the cart as a receiver unless my
legal knowledge is at fault. Meanwhile, as
I have hinted above, there lurks iii the back-
ground an earnest charity-worker bursting
with rage and disillusionment.
Dorothy Menzies Vane took a rest on
Saturday night, and, with the assistance of
her Norman, viewed the new double bill
(“Pirates of Penzance” and “Trial by
Jury”), from a box. She wore a flimsy
cream lace gown, which was attached to her
by a pink sash. The effect was great. She will
resume toil when “The Yeoman of the Guard”
is put on again. The usual first-nighters
were there, both below and aloft, likewise
fore and aft. Amidst the prevailing love-
liness my unerring eye discerned the gleam-
ing spectacles of “Springy” Springthorpe. I
call him “Springy” to indicate that he and
I are on terms of intimate friendship, and
thus make the other girls jealous, but whether
it is his official nickname, or what the latter
really is, or whether or no, for that matter,
he possesses such an incumbrance, I know
no more than a dead policeman. I also
glimpsed Mrs. Rubber Edwards’s pale fair
hair shimmering phosphorescently in the half-
light. like a stranded prawn on a moon-
bathed beach. It wag a poetic spectacle.
So was the nicture presented by Mrs. Oswald
Syme. her sister Miss Howe, and some male
studies in black and white. This group was
neatlv framed in a box. Mrs. Edwin Millar
and her White niece were in the stalls. So
were several others —but let us to the play.
“The Pirates” wore very yellow legs and
their voices were in good order —but they
were no match for the policemen, either as
regards legs, beauty or voice. I don’t want
to be harsh, but when one takes to criticism
the truth must out. Ruth Lincoln got so
many encores for her “Poor, Wandering
One” item that the rows of boiled shirt-
fronts and unclothed skulls in the stalls be-
came noticeably agitated. Art is only
endurable in the 'eyes of these bloated materi-
alists, I fear, in so far as it does not
encroach upon the drink interval. Ruth
wore white silk and puffed sleeves and mit-
tens and a peggy bag. Also a bonnet with
a feather over one eye and a snood. The
snood, like the grilse, is of Scotch extraction.
The old-time Caledonian maiden, with aspira-
tions after respectability, clung to her snood
with extraordinary tenacity —ride Walter
Scott and other authorities. To mislay this
garment was the 18th-century equivalent of
being discovered by a raiding party of Mel-
bourne police in a private room of a Collins-
street restaurant, with no other chaperon
than a young man in the preliminary stages
of the horrors. We already have the peggy
bag and the hat with the feather over one
eye. I sincerely trust that we shall be
spared the snood. The Grundy female is
active enough already, goodness knows.
Yours sincerely.

WHISKY.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Silas”: Here follows a little Australian
drama true in every detail. The scene is the
interior of a two-roomed skillion at Egg Hill (Vic.).
The living room is feebly lit with a solitary tallow
candle. The hour about 8 p.m. The night, as is
customary in such dramatic situations, is dark and
stormy. A wood fire burns in the sod chimney, and
the hissing and spluttering of the hail shot into it
varies the tinkling note of the water dropping from
half a dozen places in the roof into pans and billies
set to catch it. A woman of about 38 sits in a
dry area near the fire darning; a sniffing small boy
of nine is in another arid patch by the candle,
doing sums in a tattered “exercise.” The pair
have been so engaged for an hour past without
exchanging a word. A feeble knock falls on the
door. The mother looks at the boy; the boy looks
at his mother and sniffs. The knock is repeated.
“Kim in!” calls the woman. The latch clicks, the
door opens, and a ragged head slowly intrudes—
ragged in having ragged whiskers, ragged hair and a
ragged hat. The man looks at the woman, the
woman looks at the man; neither speaks. The
boy looks at both and sniffs. The man enters, and
closes the door. He is streaming wet. In a few
seconds a pool forms at his feet. He hugs himself;
his face is sheepish. Presently he speaks. “I’ve
kim ’ome, Ann,” he says. “So I see,” the woman
replies. “’Ave you ’ad your tea?” [That is all
there is to it apart from the fact that this is the
first time the husband and father has been seen in
seven years. ]
“Dobbyn”: “Barcoo” (B. 2/7/T.4) seeks
information. The greatest number of sheep shorn
by one station this year will be Wellshot with
270,000. Forty shearers and 48 other hands are
employed in the shed. At Isis Downs, on the Barcoo
River, a short distance from Wellshot, 250,000 will
be shorn, but this includes sheep from an adjoin-
ing station (Emmett Downs). Fifty shearers and
60 shed hands employed. This is the most up-to-
date shed in the world. All the shearing stands
and shed are lit by electricity. This allows of a
48-hours week being worked. The shearing machines
aie driven by electric power. In the earlv ’9o’s
Queensland could not sell or give away its surplus
sheep. In or about 1894 Milo station, on the
800100 River (S.W.Q.) shore 510,000. Wellshot,
in Central Queensland, shore 450,000 in one shed,
and Bowen Downs, in the same district, shore
360,000, also in one shed.
S.S.” ; On the Petticoat Lead, in a north-
ern district of Tasmania, I discovered Mr. Letherby.
Mr.- Letherby was a small, clayed-up, whiskery digger.
I think he had more whiskers than 'any man of his
inches in the six States. In fact, it would have been
utterly impossible to raise one hair more on the
face-area he possessed. Mr. Letherby was a strongly
built little man, and he lived lonesome in a small
hut about the size of a second-class cabin. When
not torturing the face of nature with a long-handled
shovel he, employed himself making artificial flowers,
and carving walking sticks, or constructing quaint
ornaments out of mutton bones. He was an artist in
the minute, and did not begrudge giving a year’s
Jcisurc/to the etching of an umbrella handle out of
the < ’shank of a ewe, or the carving of lizards,
butterflies, snakes, flowers and beetles on a knotted
stick. In the matter of detail he was as punctilious
as a Japanese sculptor, and his artificial flowers were
marvellously exact. Mr. Letherby carried this ter-
lible patience into his daily toil. I discovered him
at it one day. He was working on a hill of surface
alluvial rather smaller than Mt. Macedon, washing it
with a dish, and a little dish at that. “Great
Scott! I said, “why don’t you get a sluice going,
or use a tom or a tub, or even a cradle?” He shook
liis head, and went on pawing the wash in his pan.
And be out of a job afore I could look round,” he
said. “No fear!”
_** * *
“Bill Bundaberg”: I see how a bloke in
the old dart named Shaw has wrote a play and
makes a tart say “bloody.” Now, I’m a broad-
minded bloke. I don't go to church, and I put a
bob on the ponies now and then, so you can see I
ain’.t a wowser, as yer might say. I reckon this
play-writer he’s over the odds ; I use the word meself
pretty often, but I wouldn’t use it before a lady
(except the old woman, of course). This bloke Shaw
reckons that four-fifths of people use whatsitsname.
I dunno where he gits his Aggers from, unless he’s a
pal of Knibbs, and that ain’t likely. I don’t suppose
Knibbs ’d care to know a play-writing bloke. I
reckon Shaw’s arguments rotten. I know another
word that’s used pretty near as much. Why don’t
lie make this tart say that too? There’s lots of
things she could say. He could have had a darnce
scene with a lot of people doing the tango or one
of them hot darnces, and someone could have bumped
into this tart and she could have said: [Here,
stop!—Ed. B.]
ABORIGINAL PRIDE.
HALF-CASTE: Charlie, I want to marry your
daughter Fanny. I got a good job bound-
ary riding up at Tommy Renouf's station,
and he says we can live in the barn be-
cause it's never used now."
GOONELLEBAH CHARLIE: " Baal bam, by
Cripes. Wait you get it proper house like
it this pheller Fanny bin used live in."
“Budda Jimmy”: Re “J.R.’s” inquiry (B.
2/7/'l4). I nominate Dunlop, on Darling (N.S.W.),
purchased a couple of years ago by Vincent and
Robinson from S. McCaughey (pronounced Mac-
Ivakky), as one of the largest sheep stations. Dunno
area in acres, but here are approximate measure-
ments. Length of river frontage, 150 miles; average
•depth, 90 miles. On the station they have shorn
within a kick of half a million sheep, but drought
has reduced the tally of late years. Eighty shearers
constitute a full board, and 100 rouseabouts and 60
scour hands are also employed.
“Moana” : A scientific book I’ve got asserts
that there is only one bird known whose bite is poison-
ous, and gives its name as the Rpir N'Doob, or “Bird
of Death"’ of New Guinea. Loss of sight, convulsions
and lock-jaw are alleged to quickly follow a bite
from this deadly vermin. Will someone who
hasn’t been killed by the bird give a brief descrip-
tion of it and its poisoning apparatus?
THE REAL VICTIM.
S MITH: " She looks a very expensive bit of goods. He's been borrowing a lot of money,
too. I'm sorry for him."
S MYTHE: “Are you? Well, I think I'm more to be pitied. I lent him the money."
The freezer at Port Darwin will have to
draw most of its supplies from Wave Hill and
Victoria River country—and there are stations there
which have not had a new bull for 35 years.
The herds are as inbred as Royalty and as unhealthy.
Probably 60 per cent, of the bullocks arc tuber-
culous. Sydney market won't look at cattle from
these districts. From a pen of 10 at Homebush seven
were condemned. One of the biggest stations in the
Territory made an attempt to introduce new blood
about 20 years ago, but the young bulls died and no
further effort has been made since. That station lias
consequently been inbreeding for over 30 years. It
is nothing against the country. Some years ago the
stock of certain South Queensland stations were in
the same case, and South Queensland is all right,
as everyone knows. It took years to clean up those S.Q.
runs, and some Territory stations have got so far
behind that theirs will prove a longer job. Mean-
time, as supervision of meat export both here and
at oversea ports is so rigid, the tuberculous beast will
try to find its way to Australian tables. Hence the
new works at Darwin must have the closest super-
vision of any in Australia; and the Commonwealth
should make an ordinance immediately for the clean-
ing of all. these inbred stations and the compulsory
introduction of new stock. Otherwise a very good
cattle country will be condemned instead of the
short-sighted graziers who misuse it.
* * * *
“Billy T.” : It was at the ford above Davis
Crossing at Little River (Vic.). Jos Carden was
heading towards the mines in the hills, with a mixed
cargo of groceries, mining supplies and the parts of
an 18ft. water wheel; and Joseph’s four wheels were
pretty well down to the hubs. His cattle were rolling
about under the whip, making a poor pretence of
pulling; in reality the whole 14 weren’t
putting haulage on to the chains sufficient to lift a
cheese mite from his grip on a Cheddar. Jos ran the
lash over them again, and then let loose a fine flight
of pulsing profanity This time the bullocks did not
even deign to make a show of meeting the master’s
wishes. They stood stock still, and chewed the cud
with an indifference truly bovine. Again he tried,
and failed again. Turning away in sheer disgust he
hurled his whip on the ground, and seating himself
on a stump gazed moodily at the bullocks. “It’s
pride!” he snorted. “That’s what it is, dirty pride.
Since beef’s gone up and cattle’s been sellin’ for as
much as £25 a head, I haven’t been able to get a
ha’porth of good out of the cows!”
The man who has sense enough to know
he is an ass is not such an ass, after all. A good
fellow at Renmark (S.A.), recognising that the way
beer worries him when it gets him down is a bit
above the odds, lately went before a magistrate, ex-
plained his weakness with great candor, and obtained
an order forbidding anybody to hand him liquid
ruin. Beer had an injunction granted against it
with costs, so to speak.
“Bulli” : “First Aid” seems to consider the
case of a railway-smashed Victorian, who died im-
mediately the debris pinning him down was re-
moved, as remarkable (B. 4/6/’l4). As a matter of
fact, the phenomenon is frequent. I remember seeing
a fireman pinned against the firebox door of his loco,
which had collided with another on a small wood-
carrying line in W.A. The man’s internals were
IN TOPHET.
LIFTLIDUS: “ What now?"
LOOKACUS: “My name is still on the roll.
But I can do nothing owing to the aboli-
tion of the postal vote."
LIFTLIDUS: “Your vote will be recorded for
the party, never fear."
being slowly roasted, yet he lived for some time
imploring onlookers to finish him. It was only
when freed that he expired. In mining accidents,
too, when a fallen rock pins a man by the body,
the victim does not usually go out until the weight
is removed. As to explanation, I’m with “Fir.*’
Aid” in wanting one.

SCRAMMY’S REEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fossickin’ an’ trudgin’ through the ranges tali,
Nappin’ quartz from mornin’ until night,
Scrammy felt the promptin’, Scrammy ’eard the call,
Known to us who prospect, known to one an’ all —
The yellow lure that fills us with delight.
Ho ! it surges through an’ through
Ev’ry vein of me an’ you—
No matter what our fortunes are, or what our
bloomin’ plight.
Loamin’ an’ costeenin’, followin’ the dip,
Scrammy sought the mountain mother reef;
But the greys were alvviz rung in on the kip,
Bitter were the potions ever at ’is lip,
’ls board an’ bed were ’unger mixed with grief—
But each morn ’e’d bravely tramp
From his dreamin’ place, ’is camp,
An’ each succeedin’ day an’ night was like sl ruth-
less thief.
Many years ’e sought it. “Somewheres ’ere about,”
’E useter say, “that Eldorader lies,
An’ till I locate it I will do..without;
I’ll go on believin’—let the others doubt!
I know one day I’ll ’it upon the prize;
I’ll discover it at last,
An’ get square with all the past—
An’ won’t it he a spectacle for my ole weary eyes!
Ploddin’ from ’is ’umpy on the mountain side,
Scrammy still continued on ’is quest;
All a digger’s knowledge, all a digger’s pride
Kept ’is courage buoyant—would not be denied.
Nap-nappin’ north an’ south, an’ east an’ west,
Not a stone ’e left unturned,
Not an indicator spurned—
From rubble o.’ the ridges to the rugged mountain’s
crest.
Weary with the burden of ’is load of years,
Scrammy lay at last upon ’is bed ;
We’d no use for prayin’, we’d no time for tears
(Far as such things counted we were in arrears!) ;
An’—well, to put it briefly, ’e was dead !
Dead a week, or two, or three,
Not invitin’-like to see—
There’s many a thing, I tell you, we would rather
see instead!
Came the undertaker, took the corpse away,
An’ when we gathered Scrammy’s little kit
From beneath ’is beddin’—ho, a loud “Hooray!”
Scrammy’s Eldorader there before us lay:
A miracle—the Mother Reef, to wit!
Yes, under where ’e died,
Like a thing that meant to ’ide,
In all its virgin wholeness an’ magnificence was It!
Slept each night upon it, an’ never lived to know;
Seein’ it, poor beggar, in ’is dreams ;
Weighin’ all its riches in the starry glow;
Countin’ up the fortune paid ’im by a co.—
The splendid consummation of ’is schemes;
An’ underneath ’is bed—
Richest where ’e placed ’is ’ead—
Ah, Fortune is a curious cuss, an’ isn’t what it seems !
Pegged the ground an’ worked it, we did, an’ made
our pile ;
An’ now we drive the motor-cars of pride;
Livin’ in the city, doin’ it in style;
Wearin’, as a ’abit, self-contentment’s smile,
With ev’ry need an’ longin’ well supplied.
But I often wonder what
Would ’ave been our present lot
If Scrammy ’adn’t camped there, an’ conveniently
died!
N.s.w.

‘‘Barbwire”: Rc “J.R.’s” request (15.
2/7/'l4). The largest number of sheep ever shorn
in one shr<l in Australia were put through at Milo
Station (Q.), when 700,000 went through the blades
in 1892. Fifty-two shearers were employed, exclu-
sive of rouseabouts, pickers, classers, cooks, slushies
and whalers. So great was the number of men that
the blane-mange was made in washing tubs, and to
save time the cook's off-sider took the “smoke-ho”
around on roller skates. The area of this station in
those days was 800,000 acres, but it has been cut up
a lot recently, and last year only about 1-10,000 sheep
were shorn. Kynuna (Q.) is easily the largest sheep
station at the present time, and a couple of years
back 250,000 fleeces were cut. The number of
jumbucks on other large stations in Queensland are,
approximately, Wcllshot, 180,000; Bowen Downs,
175,000; Barealdine Dowiis and Home Creek, 110,000.
South Australia is just realising that for
the protection of native birds and animal good in-
tentions are quite useless, and so is even the Law
unless there is someone behind it with an axe. Kan-
garoo Island, large and isolated, yet handy, and not
much good for farming except in patches, seems
just the place for a Forest Deserve, and a great tract
of. it was solemnly set apart accordingly, with the
greater and lesser excommunication on anyone who
violated the law. The animals and birds that the
fox wipes out on the mainland are (in theory) in-
creasing and multiplying accordingly, and the high
justice and the middle and the low fall on those who
prevent the increase of the beasts. But Dr. Basedow,
a geologist who has been prospecting down there,
tells the S.A. Government that the “reserve” is
simply a good hunting-ground for trappers, and that
the occasional cocky of the neighborhood puts his
workers off with half wages on the ground of the
good money they can make out of the skins of the
“protected” beasts. Basedow clamors for a proper
wire-netting boundary fence, with a curator to keep
it in order and kill poachers.
THE INFURIATED MUTTON.
NEW PARSON (who has come to reclaim parishoner from sin): “Mrs. Fitzpercy, I came
to bring the lamb back to the fold."
MRS. FITZPERCY: “Well, sir, J don't envy yer yer job. He's at the pub routed the
corner, and it's a batterin' ram he is.”
Main Bearing”: It is not a fact, as
stated by “Oiniai ’ in the Abo. dept, that mastication
of the kava root in making the South Sea grog is a
general custom. In Fiji, Samoa or the Friendly
Islands, if you travel from one end to the other, you
will not see it chewed. Generally it is beaten on a
stone, slightly hollowed, with another stone. As for
being intoxicating, why it is not even exhilarating.
During the last 16 years I have seen hundreds of
bowls made, but I never saw a kava-drunk man. I
showed “Oiniai s’’ par. to an old resident who has
been trading round the Islands for the last 42 years,
and all I got out of him was “Bosh. I don't recol-
lect seeing one drunk either." The only effect 1
know the liquor has (and then only after years of
drinking it to excess) is to bring on a skin trouble
resembling a dry eczema. If it was intoxicating we
would not allow the labor boys to drink as much of
it as they like. But Papuan kava may be different
from that grown in the Islands I named. It is sup-
posed to bring on, when made a booze of, a sort of
paralysis of the legs which lasts for two or three
hours, but you may live a lifetime in Samoa or
Tonga and never see a case. I am just going to have
a morning bowl. Here’s luck!
“Bulli”: Towards sundown the pruning
expert and his off-sider drove up to Brooks’s house,
through the orchard, in search of a job. Brooks
said lie did all his own pruning, but invited them
to stay for tea. After tea the primer said, “You
say you do all your own pruning, Mr. Brooks? 1
suppose you know a great deal about the game?”
“Not a great deal, perhaps, but my trees always
produce well." “My dear sir, when driving up to
the house I noticed an apricot tree with great
long wood sticking out on one side. This has
been pruned most irregularly. I really must go
on to-night, but, if you’ll allow me, I shall be
delighted to go down and do it for you as it. should
be done.” “All right,” said Brooks, “thank you.
lake a lantern, and I 11 go down in a few minutes,
after seeing about getting your horse put in.” Off
went the primer and his man, lull of business. After
the lapse of about three minutes there was a yelling
in the vicinity of that tree, which suggested that
the lid had, suddenly fallen off Hades. “What on
earth has happened to them?” said Mrs. Brooks.
“They seem to be running this way.” “I think,”
said Brooks, “they may have disturbed the hornets
in the nest on that unpruned branch.”
* * * *
“Tiaki” : When will people get out of this
foolish business of calling their offspring Ilinemoa
and Tutanekai? Why don’t they get down to some-
thing original in Maori names; there are plenty to
select from. For instance: Rehutai (“sea-spray”),
and the kiddie can be called Bay when required to
set the table; Kapuama (“white cloud”); Itongo-
tainui (either “variegated flax” or “listening to the
great ocean”) ; Beotahi (“one voice”) ; Te Pua
(“the flower”) ; Putiwhero (“crimson blossom”) ;
Riwaikopenu (“mashed potatoes”), and Matupoaka
(“pig’s fat”). They are all very euphonious and
original. Once knew a delighted papa who (on the
advice of a waggish Maori) christened his son
“Poaka,” which means hog or pork.
A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING.
COOK OF THE DEAD DOG PUN (to parson asking a silent blessing): “You needn't be
a-smellin' your victuals—they're quite fresh."
“Sav. A’Loi”: “Silas Snell’s” mention (B.
11/0/’l4) of the Melbourne man who used to make
ami break appointments with himse'lf, reminds me
of a similar character whom I knew on the Murchi-
son (V. .A.), when 1 was located in one of those
little dead-and-alive towns which transient gold-
rushes always leave in their wake. The storekeeper
was also postmaster, and one night while sorting
some letters he held out a greasy, dilapidated
envelope for inv inspection. It was addressed, in
painfully crude handwriting, to Terence Althorpe,
Esq. Terence was a “ratty’’ old drvblower, and his
habit of writing letters to himself had long puzzled
the postmaster, so much so that I had little trouble
in inducing him to have a peep at one. We opened
it at the kettle-spout, and the subsequent amuse-
ment led to many others being overhauled. One
purported to come from Mrs. Terry Althorpe, in
England, and it thanked Terence for the cheque for
ElOOO he had sent. It stated, incidentally, that
the King had invited her and the children to spend
the week-end at Buckingham Palace. ' Terry’s law-
yers in London wrote the next epistle. They told
him his father, the Duke of , had died and left
him a coronet and a million a year. Another .was
penned by Terry’s trainer, informing him that his
horse was a certainty for the forthcoming Melbourne
Cup, and advising him to get on the betting market
early. One night, after reading the following, the
postmaster destroyed it: —-
iny darling Terry—l love you with all my hart
and sole becos you are the hansomest gentlemen I
have ever saw. I wish I was in yor arms darling
becos I am lonely. I think it dredful Terry darling
that we should be so near an yet so far sometimes
l think 1 will forget your advise an throw discretion
to the winds. AVhen I do expec to find me in
yor camp, goodnite my brave lover from vor Flo
Macfie.
Next day, Terry, after a visit to the post office, blew
out in a fury, threatening to immediately complain
to the Postmaster-General if a certain letter was not
delivered. “I know there’s one there for me,” he
shouted, “becos I saw it posted.” I felt sorry for
the postmaster, because it was a sure thing Terry
would hold to his threat, and the P.M. would find
it difficult to explain why he had destroyed the
letter. The only excuse he had was that Flo
Macfie was his wife.
“S. Snell, Esq.” : Burnie is staying at our
hoarding-house. lie is a recent acquisition. When
not subject to invidious extraneous influences, applied
internally, he is a bearable young man in a respectable
hat of some eminence, He came home the other
night, with his vest buttoned round his neck, and
his coat on inside out. He was carrying a brick-bat
in one hand, and a broken bottle in the other. He
said the brick-bat was a lobster. He imparted this
item of natural history to a roomful of Mrs. Lanlatv’s
guests. He remarked that he was not drunk, lie
leiteiated that he was not drunk. He insisted on
it. He grew declamatory about it, and as absolute
proof offered to fight any man in the room who
thought he was drunk. He went even farther, and
agreed to fight any woman in the room. Sobriety
could go no farther. Before leaving us Burnie broke
his false teeth trying to bite the lobster, and engaged
in a violent catch-as-catch-ean contest with the
grand piano, because, he said, the damthing had
been grinning at him all the evening. At the door
Burnie said he wasn’t drunk. My room is next to
Bumie’s. Towards two o’clock next morning I
was awakened by strange noises in Burnie’s apart-
merit. I went in. The electric light was going, and
Burnie was throwing shovelfuls of coal out of the
scuttle into his bed. I asked him what he was
doing, lie disregarded me. I pressed the point,
“Bed’s cold,’’ he said. “I’m puttin’ on a few
shovels of coal.” Before I left Burnie he assured
mo l’ e wasn’t drunk.

THE FAKIR AND THE JIM-JAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dark magician from the stage
Came down into the stalls one night,
And on a man of middle age
He fastened to our great delight.
Out from the stranger’s coat he drew
A rabbit and a cat or two.
The stranger did not seem surprised,
Though from his trousers then
The wizard drew in curious wise
A ’possum and a hen,
And in his battered boxer hat
He found a lizard and a rat.
In other tricks the fakir bold
Proceeded to engage,
When up the steps the stranger rolled,
And stood upon the stage.
“Say mate,” he said, “I've got a lot
Of purple snakes you clean forgot!”

A Party Government Allegory—or
Words to that Effect.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The 'Melbourne Argus is shocked at the idea of
Elective Ministries or the Initiative and Referendum
being made issues of the forthcoming elections. “There
will be,” it says, “no room for any divergence from
party lines. No intelligent elector will let the
presence or absence of this or that pet nostrum influ-
ence,his opinion of either party platform. Is Liberal-
ism or is Socialism to dominate the Commonwealth
for the next three years? That is the simple and
sufficient question for each elector.”
“Now, look you ’ere, young man, me lad,”
Old Grandma Argus said,
Patting in grandmaternal style
Australia's worried head :
“The Timers arrived for you to say
Wot girl you want to wed.”
“Well,” came Australia’s prompt reply,
“MY fancy is “Oh, dear,”
The female croaked: “your manners, lad,
Are most uncouth, I fear.
Don't hinterrupt; why can’t you wait
Till my remarks you ’ear?
“I knows two wenches, both of 'oom
Arc eager for th’ chance
To mate with you. There’s Fusion Sal,
An’ that there Labor Nance;
An’ you can try both of ’em out
At nex’ election dance.”
The scornful answer came: “I’ll Wed
With either —I don’t think.
Why, some of Nancy’s relatives
Would drive a man to drink.
While poor old hybrid Sally is
A sort of missing link!”
“But you must marry someone!” shrieked
The agitated dame ;
“And there is no one else I know,
Not as I’d care to name.
Now, look you ’ere, you jest tork sense,
An’ play th’ party game!”
“This world,” cried he, “is full of girls!”
She gasped, “ ’Ow can you sit
An’ tork like that?” The youth went on:
“There’s Carrie, Grace and Kit,
And whips of decent tarts!” But here
His grandma had a fit!
They brought her to. “I ’oped he’d choose
My Sal, for she’s a pearl” ;
She wept, “That Nance I can’t abide,
With ’er false Trades Ilall curl!
• I’d rather, though, ’e married ’er
Than any outside girl.
“These ’ussies ’oo nobody knows
Should be kept in their place ;
For lads like ’im are always apt
To fancy each r.oo face;
An’ better even Labor Nance
Than some noo-fangled Grace!
VICTORIA.
HARRISON O.
The cold reception given by the Labor
Council of N. S. Wales to the last appeal
of the Maitland coal miners for financial
help was significant. The unions are plainly
getting sick of the crowd which rushes into
a strike, and then cadges for funds. For a
long time they have disguised the sickness,-
but it is growing past disguise. Several
years ago the Labor Council decided that it
would render no countenance or assistance
to any union which struck without first
allowing the Council to judge whether the
trouble could be avoided. But whenever a
strike did occur it was urged to forget its
decision and try to appear enthusiastic, in
loyalty to “fellow unionists.” This howl
was put up by delegates who forgot that
the Council, which has adopted Arbitration,
as a principle, owed a little loyalty to itself.
If the boss institution gets over the delusion
that it must, in a spirit of loyalty, hide its
disapproval of a union that flouts its deci-
sions and “scabs” on union principles by
going on strike, there is going to be a lot
more industrial peace in N. S. Wales than
has prevailed lately.
From Teesdale Smith re the contract for
the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie line that all
the trouble’s been about: —
Randolph Bedford (B. 9/7/’l4) writes nonsense
in connection with my contract at Lake Windabout.
Give me space to enumerate his gross misrepresenta-
tions.
(1) “The double dissolution was an excellent thing
for Joseph Surface Cook if only because it suppres-
sed the Teesdale Smith inquiry.” If Bedford will
look up the papers of about the Cth inst. he will
learn that, so far from suppressing inquiry, I am
prepared to pay on account of it anything up to
£lOOO. Not much suppression there!
(2) Re the Castles machine. On my first
visit to the railway, about the middle of
February, the rails were laid out to the 684
miles (about 5480 chains), of which, accord-
ing to Bedford, the Castles machine had car-
ried out 4874 chains (less than 9 per cent.), and it
must have been discarded as unsuitable months before
my arrival. It would be incomprehensible if the
officers had stopped using the machine had its work
been more economical, because in addition to the
4874 chains done by the machine 49924 chains addi-
tional had been finished before I arrived. That is to
say, the machine had broken down and was left some
40 miles behind the head of the road. As far as a
comparison with my work is concerned, the machine,
if in good order, could not handle more than one-
tenth of my contract, on account of the position and
the toughness of the material to be handled. My con-
tract cannot therefore be brought into the argument
in any way.
(3) Examine R.B.’s figures as to the machine at
work. He remarks that the machine did 97.7 chains
per day. 1 don’t know exactly how long the machine
lias been on the works, but 1 should say 350 days.
This at 97.7 chains per day is equal to 34,195 chains,
or 427.43 miles. Allowing that it was thrown out
of commission on my account (which is the inference
to be drawn by R.B.’s remarks) the machine, any-
how, had at the very least 200 days to show what
it could do before my arrival, and 200 days at 97.7
chains per day is equal to 19.540 chains, or 244)
miles —approximately 2J times the total distance that
was laid from Port Augusta at the time of my arrival.
Could anything be more absurd, than wanting the
public to believe that this machine, which was lying
idle and broken down 60 miles behind the starting
point of my contract, was put aside to allow me
to obtain the contract to carry out work which it
is absolutely unable to handle, as I have already
stated ?
(4) Up to the time of my arrival at Port Augusta
(allowing that the Fisher Government had carried
out 18 miles), there was approximately 50 miles (or
4000 chains) to be carried out by the Cook Govern-
ment, which in 200 days is equal to 20 chains per
day. Yet the machine, according to R. 8., in one
case does approximately five times as much, and in
the other nearly seven times, the chainage daily.
Had his figures been only 20 p.c. correct, the Cook
Government need never have employed a single man
on the earthworks, except the men around the
machine; and if the earthworks were costing only
2jd., those men would not be many. So it is evident
from Bedford’s figures that the Cook Govern-
ment must be the greatest supporters of Labor imag-
inable, or it would never have kept on the number
of men doing this class of work at an average cost
of at least 1000 p.c. more. •
The sum and want of substance of it all is that
Bedford’s remarks are piffle.
A man named Bell has been giving Massey
and co. some trouble in Maoriland lately,
lie wanted Sunday Island, and he also had
a little bill for damages. For 35 years Bell
and his family have occupied the island,
which lies on the way to the Cook Islands.
The party was originally . left there
by a trading schooner, and forgotten. A few
years ago, however, the late Seddon’s offi-
cials arrived suddenly upon the island and
informed Bell that it had been annexed by
M.L., surveyed it, cut it up into three sheep
runs, and leased it to three speculative young
Maorilanders. Bell was given two acres
which he declares wouldn’t keep one
goat, and half a goat or even three-
ninths of a goat is very little use.
Presumably, after waiting for a few
years to get a boat, Bell has at last
reached the Seddon Archipelago in pursuit
of justice, but about all he can get Bill
Massey to say is, “The matter will receive
careful consideration.” That’s about the
only thing that Massey can say these days.
“N. or M.”: Hobart’s municipal trams,
though bought at great price (£212,500)
from Private Enterprise, threaten to. be a
paying investment. The City Council
reckons that the year’s takings should exceed
expenses by £lB,OOO to £20,000, which, even
when interest anfi sinking fund on the bor-
rowed £250,000 have been deducted, should
leave a margin. The first-fruits of the
change of ownership have been the con-
struction of a tramway to West Hobart,
running up Liverpool-street, and zigzagging
unsoberly to the rescue of the Upper Goul-
bourne-street and Lansdown-crescent divi-
sion, which hitherto has sat marooned among
its hills and watched the New Town and
Sandy Bay trams draw the city northward
and southward. Hobart cannot step back-
ward without climbing, and there are some
steep pinches and awkward corners on the
new line which, between Princes-street and
the Crescent, ascends 300 ft. in three-quarters
of a mile. But there is no danger. The
locally-made cars are fitted with breaks war-
ranted to stop anything short of Australia’s
rush to the pawnbrokery.
That somewhat remarkable N.S.W. priest,
Father O’Reilly, has had something to say
about the efficacy of prayer—Anglican
prayer. The Anglicans had prayed against
“Catholic emancipation,” and the disestab-
lishment of the Irish Church, and the dis-
establishment of the Welsh Church, yet all
these things had gone through; and lie de-
duces from this that Ulster ought to pray
the Anglicans to pray for the other party.
On the other hand, things haven’t always
gone the R.C. way either —or the way of
any other praying denomination, for that
matter. The Intelligence Department in
Heaven is, in fact, kept busy sorting out
the conflicting prayers of pious persons who
are Protestants or Roman Catholics, Liber-
als or Laborites, plaintiffs or defendants,
Bri tains or Boers, “books” or punters,
buyers or sellers, bulls or bears. Poor little
selfish petitions they mostly are, addressed
to an Omniscience by people who think
they know still more, or to the Most Just by
worms crawling on their stomachs and ask-
ing to be given an advantage over the other
fellow, not on the grounds of their own
weakness and greater need, but, bless you,
on the grounds of their own superior merits.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
The new Governor-General, who is Scotch and
Presbyterian, attends St. Stephen’s, in Phillip-street
when he is in Sydney. He is the first Governor who
has cold-shouldered Anglican St. James’s —barring
Gerald Strickland, who is R.C. —since the time of
Sir Thomas Brisbane (1821-5). There is a legend
that on Sir Maurice O’Connell’s return to Australia
in the ’4o’s as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, he
was driven to church the first Sunday. When the
coachman was passing St. James’s he felt the check
string pulled violently. Sir Maurice asked the coach-
man where he was going. “Why, to St. Mary’s, of
course, your Honor.” “No, to St. James's. When
in Rome do as Rome does,” he said —and St. James’s
it was with the O’Connell-Bligh family afterwards.
“Yarrum”: Let me enter a plea for a
couple of score of calves that are leaving
Iviama for Sydney, by rail, some time to-
night. Within a stone’s throw of where I
am writing is an open truck filled with
them. A bitterly cold wind is sweeping
through it all the time, and the animals
have no trousers or overcoats. This sort of
thing goes on every Tuesday night,
and the cries of the poor, naked
beasts are something to lament about.
These humble creatures have been cooped
up now for seven hours, and I’m
told they will not be .moving Sydneywards
for an hour or two yet. I feel that wild that
I could go down and strangle the night
officer, who is not responsible. I don’t know
who is responsible, but whoever he is his
grandmother had a tail.
An Adelaide man, of the kind that loves
a fight, has been busy falsifying the axiom
that warns one against buying a lawsuit;
and the opponent he deliberately elected to
run up against was the Stock Exchange, too.
A member of the Exchange became insol-
vent, and the Exchange, according to its
custom, sold his seat. Share business being
quiet, the price was only £450, of which £5O
was paid to another member to whom in-
solvent owed money, and about £7O went in
recognised fees. The trustee in insolvency
demanded the balance of £332 on behalf of
the creditors, but was told that under the
Stock Exchange’s constitution membership is
a private matter, and the seat reverts to the
Exchange on insolvency. Not wanting
trouble, the trustee sold the dubious claim
against the Exchange for £35, and the sport-
ing buyer has got a verdict for the whole
£332. The Supreme Court (Justice Mur-
ray) told the Exchange that any regulation
which hinders creditors from getting their
rights is a fraud upon the insolvency law.
And after that all is confusion.

The Royal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract: “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” -Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are al solutely free from all harmful germs.

A Simple Recipe for Clearing
the Complexion.
Exposure to hot winds and sun makes the
nerves and muscles of the face tired and life-
less, and the skin shrivelled, wrinkled and
unhealthy.
If anyone with a sallow, blotchy, wrinkled
or pimply complexion will only take a little
trouble in following the directions here given
they will find a marvellous improvement in
their complexion. Get some Puritol Wax
from the chemist or draper, and apply at
night, washing off in the morning with warm
water and soap. Then lap a little cold
water 10 times upon the face with the hands,
allowing it to get thoroughly round the
closed eyes. The treatment should be fol-
lowed out in every detail to ensure success,
and undoubtedly accounts for many of the
clear complexions so much admired by those
who do not yet know the secret. See that
you get the right kind, it will not injure the
most delicate complexion.*
HORSESHOE”

is Richer than Meats and contains the

It’s DELICIOUSLY FRESH.
POLITICAL
POINTS
Ihe tariff problem still refuses to sink. In
Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide new bottle-
making machinery is threatened, the idea
being to greatly reduce the number of men
required to make a given number of beer-
overcoats, and enable a less expert class of
toiler to be employed. Two possibilities
naturally arise—the same old two. One is
a hopeless sort of tariff-sinking strike with a
view to shutting out improvements, so that
the Australian bottle will lag behind the
foreign one indefinitely, and be a slow, old,
hand-made thing for a while longer. The
other is to put up a hefty struggle over the
tariff; to shut out so many imported bottles
that there will still be work for all hands ;
to abolish the practice of floating foreign
loans to pay for foreign bottles; and to
demand a duty which will force the local
manufacture of bottle-making machinery.
To put it another way, Mrs. Partington may
Ir.v to keep back the rising tide with her
broom, or she may use the rising tide io
float her shin and make profit thereby.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.]

AUSTRALIA: “ Well, the mad beef question is
going to help drive Joe out of the picture."

The N.S.W. State Legislature has decided
by a majority of 30 that Premiey Holman
didn t say anything unpleasant about Speaker
.Meagher, and that Speaker Meagher would
rather have perished by the wayside than
say anything disagreeable about Premier
Holman. So once more everything in the
garden is lovely.
A par. in the Melbourne dailies last week
carried its own comment on the foolishness
or Parliamentary ceremonial and the
duties of State Governors. It was solemnly
recorded that the President and other mem-
bors of the Leg. Council waited upon Sir
Arthur Stanley to present him with the
Address in Reply to his gubernatorial speech.
Vvi , 1(1 t“ e Speaker and other members
i° ii * B ' Assem bly performed the same
hollow farce. The blessed Address in Reply
involves a sinful waste of debate to begin
with, and when it is at last drawn up it
ought, to be posted to his Ex. and lost in
transit.
lhe people of N.S.W. got quite a shock
last week when a Bathurst storekeeper gave
evidence before a Wages Board to the effect
that the Increased Cost of Living is some-
thing of a bogey. He said the animal is
almost confined to Sydney, and thatfit exists
there chiefly because the One Big City
policy has driven up the,price of land, and
consequently the house and shop rents, so
high that it takes a telescope to see them
and a balloon to reach them. Sydney leaped
ni anger on its imported hat at this report,
but the Bathurst man stood firm, and even
offered, by way of proof, to sell ladies’ cloth-
ing at Jess than Sydney prices. Then the
capital leaped on its hat some more.
TWO HEAPS.
It has been cabled that Ex-President Huerta
has left Mexico in good financial circumstances.
The blessings of Freetrade! Last year
Uncle Sam rushed 3619 complete motor-cars
into Britain, worth £744,392, and r parts to
the tune of £806,686, or a total of over
£1,550,000. During the same period John
Bull only got 76 complete cars into Uncle’s
country, worth £59,600, and parts worth
£49.117, or a total of £108,717. So Free-
trade, as usual, got what it calls tenders for.
The boss-in-charge of the
Port Augusta (S.A.) end of
the east-west railway an-
nounces with modest pride
that the 95 miles of rail so
far laid have, in the last
three months, earned £lO,OOO,
counting wharfage at the
Port. It is said that the
other, or Kalgoorlie, end of
the line, though about the
same length, has so far
taken a bare £lOO. Out back
from Port Augusta there are
a few moderate mining-
camps and some good sta-
tions, so that stores go up
and wool comes down. In-
cidentally, the line helps to
knock out the camel and the
unwelcome Asiatic who drives the bad-
tempered beast.
In N. S. Wales Assembly lately the Wade
party has been beating the tom-toms regard-
ing the alleged leakage of information from
Government departments into the possession
of Labor supporters. Nothing was proved,
but the mere thought of such a thing hor-
rified the Liberals. When the clamor had
died down their leader, Gregory Wade, fired
this question at the Minister for Lands: —
Did he receive a communication from the honorable
member for Albury in the following terms: 1 —
“Re Mr.[Appleton’s application for a piece of re-
serve near Jingellic, Upper Murray. You promised
to have a report from the District Surveyor. I would
be glad if you would have a report on the other re-
serves up the Murray—one on Olivine station and
one near Stony Creek, about which T enclose a letter
from Mr. Lucas. It would do me and the party a lot
of good to have these reserves made available.—Yours
faithfully, J. Cusack.
“Lucas’s family seven converts to Labor for the
first time.” -
The astonished Trefle said he had received it.
The crowd, behind Wade said nothing worse
than “hear, hear.” Apparently all that is
wrong witli the leakage of information from
the departments is when it leaks the wrong
way.
Australia is in no way responsible
for the fact that some Servian ruffians
waylaid and murdered the heir to the
Austrian Empire and his wife, or for
the second fact that Austria is natur-
ally angry, or for the third fact that Servia
is cantankerous in the matter of giving satis-
faction. But if the affair develops into a
general European war Australia may go
bankrupt. This country has got into the
habit of depending on foreign loans for a
great deal of its daily bread. "Also, it de-
pends on the foreign loan-monger to find the
money for the renewal of the old Joans as
they fall due. If a general convulsion starts
in Europe, a begging, cadging, borrowing
country, with few people and weak defences,
isn’t likely to get loans for quite a while,
except on ruinous terms. And then the
number of things that the bottom must fall
out of will be marvellous. If Australia
imported artisans instead of goods, and paid
its way instead of trusting to the foreign
capitalist, it need not mind even if a million
Servian ruffians shot 20 Austrian princes.
As things stand, it may have to leave all its
new railway works unfinished, and abandon
its half-built Canberra, and get down to long
hours, hard work and a very plain diet.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
It has been decided in Maoriland,
so far as the Lower House can de-
cide. that henceforth, if 55 per cent,
of the votes polled at a Drink Refer-
endum go for Prohibition, the
Dominion will become dry from one
end to the other. Provided the
measure isn’t wrecked in its later
stages the end of grog in the islands
is in full view, for though the old
60 per cent, majority was never
quite attained 55 per cent, seems
easy. Now, if Maoriland would
enact that no loan could be floated
except on a 55 per cent, vote, and
tlie borrowing bottle was put under
the same restrictions as the beer
bottle, and the 1.0.G.T. fixed its eye
on the lOU, what a lot of tilings
might happen.
Premier Watt, of Victoria, having
thrown up his State job to try for a
seat in the House of Representatives,
his old place at Essendon was
promptly captured by a Laborite.
Watt’s Liberal majority of. 1400.
turfled into a Liberal minority of
3900. The new Liberal candidate hadn’t
Watt’s jaw, which sticks out like a fender.
So he went down. Jaw-measurement counts
for a great deal in politics.
The elector grows deaf in both ears these
days through Cook shouting truthfully on one
side about Wisher’s neglect of the Northern
-territory, and Fisher shouting accurately at
the other ear about Cook’s neglect of the
same place. One time-server depends largely
on the Sydney vote, and the other side-
stepper has his stronghold in Central Queens-
land. Each place wants the Port Darwin
railway to go through its back yard, with a
great central station at its ash-barrel, and
the railway repairing shops close to its
kitchen sink. It isn’t safe to remind these
infuriated backyarders that the short, sen-
sible line, and the one to which the Com-
monwealth is pledged, goes across the middle
of the continent, by Hie Port Augusta route.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
THE ETERNAL HASH.
(Apropos Joseph's Policy Speech last week.)
Proprietor Cook (political cafe): “Yes,
young man, I collected the hi ingredients
an' made it meself. There's a scrap uv
every dish that's bin on the menu uv this
place the last 14 years in it. So it orter
strike yer partickler taste in at least SOME
direction!”
[Devised and drawn by EDWARD COLLES. BeDrave-
street, Manly, N.S.W.]
NECESSITY, ETC.
A Bill authorising national prohibition—banishing
all alcohol except what is required for medicine,
science or art —is under consideration in Maoriland.
—Sydney daily.
“Fer Gorsake, boss—I'm a doctor meself,
Fatty's a sciencer and longnrs a harlist,
and we’re all out o' beer.”
From a man on the spot:—
'I lie \ ic. A.W.N.L. is proving a blessing io its
opponents. The ladies have 11W fomented a species
.of mild dogfight or riot at Bourke, and a similar
outbreak at Ilenty. For a long while no Fusionist
offered to tackle Anstey for the Bourke seat, so the
local Liberal League persuaded its sec., R. M. Jen-
nings, to face the shambles. This was the signal
for the local branch of the A.W.N.L. to put forward
Dr. Lee, of St. Hilda. Members were then asked if they
would support Jennings if he were selected bv
ballot. Their chilly reply was: “Lee or Rebellion.”
So everyone i.s extremely embarrassed, and both Lee
and Jennings threaten Anstey, and the Laborites are
tickled to death. At Henty the A.W.N.L. has ■ con-
centrated on Boyd, boss of the training ship, Harbor
Trust Commissioner, coal-mine director and Free-
trader. Meanwhile, Crouch, who briefly represented
Corio in the dim past, lias bogged furiously in on
the Protectionist ticket. When the organisations set
about their_ pre-election--ballot, Crouch’s nomination,
sent in by post 14 days before, had mysteriously
disappeared, and Boyd’s had done likewise, it having
been handed to a clerk, who gave it to a lift-boy,
who passed it on to a messenger, who transferred it
to a sweeper-out, who transmitted it to a glass-eyed
epileptic named Ezra, who gave it to a man to hold
while he was having a fit, who lost it. The result
is no nominations have been officially made, and all
parties, after hurling around charges of hanky-panky,
have decided to go right ahead as though ‘ nothing
had occurred. That is so far as a powerful under-
current of suspicion and hate will let them.
[F. C. Jones, Elgar-road, Bunvood, Vic.]
Thus the S. M. Herald, denouncing the
attempt now being made “in Victoria....
to place Protection before everything” dur-
ing the present Federal contest:—
The Inter-State Commission has been sitting con-
tinuously to deal with anomalies in the tariff....
Neither Freetrader nor Protectionist can throw a
stone at it in the matter of impartiality.
But, unfortunately, nothing has come of its
sittings as yet. Local wages have gone up,
local hours have been shortened, local con ■
ditiolis have been changed, local
railway and steamboat rates
have risen—but the tariff has
remained the same, and the
blessed, old Commission has sat
impartially. The most im-
partial thing this writer knows
is an old stump outside his
gate. It is perfectly honest.
It. raises no political or re-
ligious controversy. It insults
nobody, nor docs it asperse any-
body. No trusting maiden has
ever been deceived by it unless
she fell . over it in the dark
after drinking beer. If two
parties gave evidence before it
on a large public matter it
wouldn’t iean to one side more
than another. It is perfectly
unbiased and dispassionate. It
sits continuously, and neither
Protectionist nor Freetrader
throws a stone at it. Yet
nothing happens. That is where
the'trouble comes in, and that is
why Protection is a live issue to-day.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
Boyd, M.11.R.; revealed his astute states-
manship to a meeting at Oakleigh (Yic.)
on July 20. Thus :
One morning he had been told that two members
were away for breakfast, so he slipped into the
House like, greased lightning, moved that the ques-
tion be put, and caufcht the others napping.
This happened in the National Parliament
of the Commonwealth. The dissolution of
one House, at any rate, did not come too
soon.
[Edmund Fisher, The Bulletin Office, 369 Collins-
street, Melbourne.]
THE ALIEN BEGGAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Church rait-es no objection to the action of
the Commonwealth authorities in excluding half a
dozen Armenian priests who have come to Australia
on a begging mission. Even that section of the
( lunch which regards our alien immigration restric-
tions as an outrage of divine law accepts this ruling,
lis true we can’t permit these priests
Our pastors dear to dispossess.
Here cash results, to say the least,
Are wicked in their scantiness;
And though the parson preach and prate
For bread, too often his reward
Is nothing but an empty plate.
’Tis very plain we can’t afford
To let Armenians sleek and fat
Come bawling with the shovel hat.
Six hatters more—but ’tis divine
On these to draw the color line!
Another thing it is, of course,
When Austral bishops cross the sea
Upon tiie older world to force
Australia’s sacred poverty.
They shake the box at John Bull's door,
And gather in the widow’s mite,
The welkin breaking with the roar
Of these apostles of the Light.
But when, as happens now, it comes
To raking all the States for thrums,
They’re willing that their Christian neighbor
Should rank as common colored labor!

MYSTERIOUS STOMACH
TROUBLES.
PRINCIPAL CAUSE REVEALED.
A great deal of mystery is made abont
stomach troubles, and many people go in
constant dread of life-long incapacity or the
horrors of the operating table just because
they experience pain in the region of the
stomach for which they cannot account.
Instead of looking for the cause of the
trouble, they seem only too ready to de-
scribe themselves as “martyrs to indigestion”
or “chronic dyspeptics.”
Excessive acidity is said to be the direct
cause of more than 90 per cent, of all stomach
troubles, and, according to many eminent
physicians, the occasional use of a reliable
antacid, such as half-a-teaspoonful of pure
bisurated magnesia in a little water after
meals, will do more towards righting stomach
derangements than all the patent foods and
medicines ever invented, because this gets
at the root of the trouble —stops fermenta-
tion of the food contents, and neutralises the
acids which otherwise would irritate and
inflame the stomach.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
The big winter meeting at Caulfield begins
on Saturday, and although a few of the timber-
toppers have got out of repair within the past three
weeks, there should be good fields for the Australian
Hurdle Race and the Steeple that happens a week
later. Whereas the lightweights have mostly had
the best of it over the three miles at Flemingtbn
the longer race at Caulfield is won by a topnotcher
as often as not. Arquebuse, with ilst. 1111). up,
is not out of it, nor Wimmera (list. 51b.) if he
starts. To fel lowers of the game it goes without
saying that the unsatisfactory Lord Grey would be
another of E. A. Connolly’s unblessed “certs.” if he
cleared all the hurdles and finished as he finished
in the Grand National. But the grey horse ran
badly at Moonee \a 1 ley last Saturday, and perhaps
he is best left alone. The two old battlers that
strike this writer as being sober, respectable stavers,
with “form” to recommend them, are Arquebuse and
Dust Cloud. A warlike “double” for the Australian
Hurdle and Steeple would be Arquebuse and Eattle-
sliip.
At time of writing the hurdler Darrawii
was under the suspicion of the stipendiary stewards
tor having won a race at Moonee in great style a
week subsequent to a very bad performance elsewhere.
If the explanations were as they
usually are in these case for inquiry* Darrawa is
likely to be a very fancied candidate for the big
event at Caulfield next Saturday.
Sydney racing season for 1914 put up the
shutters on Saturday last, and the distended figures
show how the worship of the brute grows apace At
the horse clubs during the year, £137,700 was ladled
out in prize money to a lot of more or less useless
nags, being an increase of £15,391 on the 1913
folly. And- on the pony courses the boodle handed
out rose from £41,077 to £45,250. And mostly
pan! out on annuals about as useless for the business
of life as large dogs with three smells. Marvellous
how this horse-racing swindle flourishes.
Canterbury Park (Sydney) race meeting
on baturday supplied more Ilian the usual week-end
swear. The chief blasphemy centred round the han-
dicap of the day, the Canterbury Cup, which had a
I att. s sweep tacked to its coat-tail. The winner
Alatouree, was soundly hooted for alleged past mis-
deeds, such as winning when he wasn’t backed, and
stopping to think or to compose poetry when he wa-
backed. The blessed goblet attracted 12 starter's, of
which three toppled and spilled much cash into
Ikeys bag as well as their jockeys in the slush.
Also m the Hurdles, the favorite brought joy to lb*
of tlie Bag by spurning its rider into the nether
mud. The stewards had a couple of difficult cases
against alleged offenders of the day, but settled all
difficulties by administering—take a breath a
caution. And on top of all these unsatisfactory
doings there was the solemn fact that the favorite
went under in every race. So the punter’s pannikin
\vas full to overflowing. Still, only a fool would
have been out on such an afternoon'.

playing with beautiful method and determination’
early established a lead which they stead lv in-’
creased till at the close thev had 86 points on the
board to St. Hilda’s 47. The winner’s score was
good, but they owe their victory more to the reliable
defence of the backs, who outplayed the Saints’ for-
wards till the game was absolutely safe. A 25,000
Crowd watched the uproar, and nearly as many, in
each case, sustained severe shocks at.' the ’Roy and
South grounds, where Geelong and Essendon respec-
tively downed the locals. ’Roy held the Seasiders
level up to lemon-time, but in the last term the
hefty men from the Pivot carried all before them,
and piling on 28 points to ’Roy's six, returned home
victorious and bordering on hysteria, with 79 points
to 53. The in-and-out ’lion’s, having drawn with
St.. Kilda, and been soundly thrashed by Richmond,
visited South, went off with a whoop and a bound
and simply galloped away with the game, the Red-
and-M lute’s toiling hopelessly in the rear through-
out. The scorer’s ultimate announcement —’Don 104
points, South 32 —-fully justified the flabbergasted
Isarrackers “Blime.” It was a rout. Carlton
totted up 111 points to Melb.’s 58, and Richmond 94
to 1 arsity s 71. The day’s games left Carlton on
top of the list, four points (one game) ahead of
R°y- Two points lower follow Geelong, South and
Hood, dead level; with Essendon two points fur-
ther back, and Saints two still further; and there
is yet no saying which of the seven will fill the four
places or who will lead on the first round, with the'
double chance for premiership.
With but one game to play to finish the
first round the Victorian Ass. four can be named—
North, ’Scray, Essendon and ’Town—unless the latter
loses to Brighton next Saturday, in which case
Brunswick may arrive. The two first-named are
level m games won, but North has much the better
percentage of points scored for and against. On
Saturday ’Scray met ’Cote, and yanked itself to
within reach of North by trampling 1 recklessly over
the Brickies and harrying their feelings with a score
of 134 points to 44. North simultaneously kept its
Position by outing ’Town with 50 points to 39; and
Don pushed P’ran finally off the wharf by notching
94 points to 81. P’ran made a brave effort to hang
on, but its goal-kickin<>- was slack and ill-directed.
Brunswick, with misty hopes of ’Town’s defeat next
Saturday, did its darnedest against Hawthorn, and
raked in 103 points to 69. Unluckily for the
Brickies, should ’Town keep its end up all their
efforts will have been in vain. Brighton also pol-
ished off Port by 84 points to 61, but the circum-
stance was of no moment.
ADVANCE AUSTRALIA!
Saylor, temporarily insane, with an
earthquake in each glare, ineffectually pursue „
the fleeting Kay for 20 laps.
There was riot in Sydney football
circles last week over an alleged attempt by the
Rugby League to induce the Maoriland Union team
to turn its coat and finish up its tour by playing a
match with the League’s representative team. Said
one Maorilander: “An offer of £3OOO was made to
the All Blacks if they would play an Australian
League team. The League has plenty of . money and
will stop at nothing to get players.” lie also added
that temptation in the shape of about £2OO per man
is hard to resist. These are very woolly words which
require some substantiation. The Rugby League is
on the warpath with an emphatic declaration that it
wasn’t such a golden ass as to offer £3OOO to any-
body, and it makes a loud howl for particulars. Per-
haps somebody has been pulling the Maoriland leg.
In spite of driving rain and evil conditions
underfoot no less than 15,000 people gathered on
Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a clamor of feet
and a flying of mud between the two crack League
teams, Eastern Suburbs and Newtown. It was a
stirring battle, and Fortune skirmished round in a
state of indecision. With her skirts flying and her
bonnet askew, she fled this way and that. Two
penalty goals gave Newtown a lead of one point at
half-time, but the premier team got a penalty goal,
and led by five to Newtown’s four. Then the fur
flew, and both sides defended alternately till light
on time, when Eastern Suburbs blundered. From
the penalty kick Newtown scored the goal which
gave it the victory by six points to five. Another
Homeric struggle took place at Wentworth Park
between Glebe and North Sydney. The Glebe team
was the sounder in defence, and it was sound defence
that won the day. At half-time Glebe, with two
penalty goals, led by four to two, and shortly after
the resumption lifted the score to nine. The North-
men let loose a series of charges which kept the
Glebe contingent on its line, fighting for its life.
But it fought well. The Northmen only succeeded
in breaking the red line once, and then failed to
add the points, so Glebe won by nine to five. South
Sydney, the leading team in the competition, retained
its lead by smiting Western Suburbs at the Agricul-
tural Ground—2o points to three. Balmain and
Annandale played a very even game of mud-polo, or
something of the sort, at Bircbgrove Quagmire. Bal-
main triumphed by 11 to five.
* * * *
The Northern Union team in Maoriland
had a gorgeous win at Auckland, where it apparently
caught the local men in some bad country. The
ground was just as soaked as it could be, and
although the Auckland forwards held the opposing
pack, the local back machine was rustv or out of
gear, or something. At half-time the English were
on top of the heap by 15 points to four, and defeat
was practically certain. But in the second half the
Auckland backs crumpled right up, and the defeat
became a rout by 34 points to 12.
The sodden ground in and around Sydney
last Saturday made football hard and unpleasant
work. The Rugby Union finished its first round, and
Glebe, South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs and University
duly qualified for “A" division, which will
now play off for the premiership. Balmain,
Manly, St. George, Western Suburbs, North Sydney
and Randwick are relegated to “B” division, and
will have a sort of second-rate premiership of then-
own—the supremacy of the outed, so to speak. The
University Oval is never a pleasant snot, but on
Saturday last it was a veritable bog of desolation,
and in its depths University toiled mightily against
the triumphant Eastern Suburbs. Both sides played
a spectacular game during the first half, and then
both were too weary to bother about appearances,
and bogged in for the honor and glory. Eastern
Suburbs led at half-time with nine to six, and the
ease of the Students looked hopeless. And it was.
The Eastern men wound up a decisive game with 17
to nine. Glebe had a day out at Rushcutter’s Bay,
where it overtook Balmain’s team and rolled it in
the mud with scorn and derision, and all the obloquy
represented by a 30 to nil victory,; The downfall of
Turkey in the late wat was nothing compared to
that of Balmain on Saturday. North Svdnev and
Randwick had a difference of opinion at the Sports
Ground, and when the t\Vo teams wiped the mud out
of their eyes they discovered that North Sydney had
won by five tn three. Out at Hurstville, Western
Suburbs got St. George down and kicked it by 17
to six. .South Sydney crossed the water, and biffed
Manly by 14 to six.
* * * *
The chief features of the Soccer disturb--
anee on Saturday were the return match between
Sydney and Newcastle, and a wild struggle in the
State championship competition between Newtown
and Canterbury. The former event took place at
Epping, and although was slow it was strenuous.
The Newcastle men attacked. They dominated the
game slightly, and at half-time led by one goal to
nil. The second half saw the Metropolitan team
settle down to a better stride and more systematic
play. Against the improved combination Newcastle
individual brilliance wap powerless, and the Sydney
gang slowly batted its way to the net and finally
won out with three goals to two. The Newtown-
Canterburv struggle took place at Campsie, and raged
very evenly till close on time. The scores were one
all, and it looked like another draw, but just ns time
was running out Newtown found an odd goal lying
around loose and so triumphed with two to one.
In the Australian Code the first round
finished on Saturday, and South Sydney, Sydney and
Paddington have qualified for the
semi-finals. Newtown and Central
Western will plav off to see which
will make up the quartette. The
downpour spoilt the play, but Pad-
dington won easily from Central
Western, and Newtown smashed North
Sydney at the eleventh hour and 59th
minute, after that team had led con-
sistently from the jump. East Sydney
was in a. hopclgss plight, when South
caught it and knocked saucepans and
(lie Devil out of if to the tune of
137 points to 21. Whereby the bang-
ing of Bannaglier was done to some
purpose.
As not one mter-Stnte athlete made the
trip the Queensland Five Miles Cross Country Cham-
pionship oil Saturday degenerated into a purely local
afniir. Yet with 59 peris, facing the gun it pro-
mised to be a very vigorous local affair. IV. Hamil-
ton, last year’s winner, had too much hack-kick in
his legs and he tucked them under at such a sus-
tained gait that he waltzed home with lOOvds. be-
tween him and the perspiring army. The event makes
the way easy for the selection committee and the
Bananaland team, for the Australian Cross Country
. Championship contingent in October on Victorian soil
will consist of the first half-dozen past the post, to
wit. Hamilton, Russling, Baqon, Robinson, Caldwell
and Bennett.
* * * *
J. A. Prout was the top-notcher at the
Bananaland amateur track and field championships
meeting last week at Brisbane. He gathered the
high jump, the 440vds. hurdles, and the running
broad jump titles. He was the one. collectivist
present, all the other silverware drifting one item at
a time into the pantry of separate peds. The Club
( hampionship fell to the Toowong Harriers, the top
dog club of the northern hunk of Australia.
Sydney baseball bristled with stirring
episodes, oil Saturday when the top-notchers fought
to keep their place on the buttered pole of suprem-
acy. waverley versus Paddington was a hair-raising*
spectacle. Amid the howls of barrackers, and the
spluttering and hissing of the rain, Waverlev downed
Paddington by seven runs to five—a close call
Leichhardt and University also put up a bickering
likely to afreet the hearts of nervous barrackers, and
University went to earth by three runs to one —each
side scoring in only one innings out of nine. Lane
Cove attacked Mosman-North Sydney, and when
darkness fell on the sodden landscape, as it did on
the Alpine village when the youth shouted “ Excel-
sior,” as mentioned in the purposeless poem, the
(oves were leading bv four runs to three. Peter-
sham cheerfully leaped on Burwood and kept on
doing it till the figures stood at 22 to nine a
refreshing wallop. The competition still broods under
the shadow of uneertaintv, the order of the rush
being Waverley, 12 wins; Leichhardt, 11; Petersham
nine; Paddington, seven; and the other teams in
the tureen and out of sight.

Lacrosse in Sydney on Saturday was
like a woman’s temper, full of surprises. The round
leaves the rush for the premiership in a very even
muddle. The slaughter of the day was that of Syd-
ney before the charge of Petersham, with 14 goals' to
three. Sydney held the top rung of the ladder be-
fore this disaster. Balmain and Mosman supplied
the best proceedings of the day, and the aristocrats
ot the lower harbor went down smash before the
fiends from the tattered but industrial suburb Figures
were six to three. The other matches were annihila-
tion. St. George outed Manly bv 15 goals to one
think of it! Eastern Suburbs chased University off
the landscape by 13 to three. The result of this" riot
is to leave Sydney and Petersham in the lead with 20
points each, followed closely by Mosman with 18
Balmain and Eastern Suburbs have 16—and these
are the only clubs with a chance in the semi-finals
The Australian rifle team had a pleasant
time at Bisley, in the land of our father Bull. The
Kolapore Cup and the Mackinnon Trophy (the out-
ward signs of international rifle supremacy) both fell
to the guns of Australia. It is a shooting double
worth getting excited over. In the other matches the
’Possums picked up stray cash and trophies, and
McAlister of the Ma State made some pocket money
by annexing third prize in the King’s. It was the
day when the tail of the Kangaroo was exalted.
The outcome of the Federal Cycling Con-
ference at Melbourne is a general resolution to be
up and doing—doing anyone or anything to save the
professional side of pedal-pushing. ' Otherwise it
denounced itself as a mob of goats. The split in
Victoria last season cut the sport in the Cabbage
State to the very spine, and while- the seceder —the
Inter-Club Cycling Association—supplied the races
the Victorian League of Wheelmen sat still and nursed
the title. The Federal' Conference," however, brought
the balm of common-sense to bear, and the rift was
healed. An equal number of representatives from
each body will now control the sport in the southern
State. The agreement between the various State
leagues will be made more binding and yet more
elastic Federal cycling is to be practically ruled
from Sydney by Larkin, M.L.A., of Rugby League
fame, as president, and 11. Mackay as secretary.
Which is a certain guarantee that it will be handled
with vigor, discretion and tact. The outlook, is riot
very bright, but it is somewhat more rosy than it
has been for some time past.
After all the riot and rumpus “Gunboat”
Smith has settled everything by writing referee
Eugene Corri a very nice letter, in which he de-
clares that the tony arbiter acted perfectly right and
proper in the late Carpentier-Smith sera]). Still,
Corri doesn’t come out of it too well. If lie bad
said nothing he would have got on better. There
seems to be little doubt that Carpentier’s frantic
manager was in the ring before Smith lost his head
and bashed the kneeling Frenchman. Also, there
doesn’t seem to be much doubt, on the evidence of
the pictures, that Smith caught the gallant Gaul
with his knee somewhere in the bingey or the terri-
tories adjacent thereto. Altogether it seems to have
been a rotten fight. All things considered, perhaps
it is as well that Reg Baker did not, succeed in
bringing the much-advertised Frenchman to Sydney.
Me begins to look over-rated, somehow.
* * * #
The knocking-out of Ilughie Mehegan in
the Ilth round at Melbourne was bad enough, but
the general result of the scrap was worse. From start
to finish the Australian managed to score in only one
round, and the other 10 were Joe Shuarue’s. In that
session, the fourth, Mehegan did manage to get
home a few heavy ones, but even then the American
was not in any real danger. In the seventh he caught
Mehegan with a, left hook and sent the Australian
lightweight champion down for seven, and in the
11th he taught him again with the same blow and
sent him profoundly to bed. Apparently Ilughie
Mehegan’s brilliant career is over, and bis friends
would like to see him retire. Fortunately he is in
a position to do so. He made much cash during
the year's he was invincible, and be lias held on to
it and invested it wisely.
When Fred Kay, the Australian boxer,
secured.a decision over Milburn Saylor in Melbourne
some time ago, the Sydney apostles and hot-gospellers’
of the game wondered if it were a wrong decision
or if something had gone amiss with the mighty
Milburn. Had his boiler struck a. rock or had his
stomach paid two hob in the £? But when the
same pair got together in the Stadium ring last
Saturday night the scales fell from the eyes of the
Sydney-siders, and the thing was revealed, and
made plain unto them. Saylor was a better
lighter, a harder hitter, and many other things
—but he never - had a hope, simplv because be
was (compared to Kay) too slow to catch anything,
lie was like a hen chasing a hurricane. He was so
slow (compared to Kay) that he only succeeded in
landing about half a dozen wallops during the whole
performance—it could not be called a battle. Yet
Fav gave r:o appearance of dazzling speed any more
than the earth does when it tries to get round the
sun in 365 days. lie. just got out of. the way.
Sometimes he-walked out of it. Sometimes he danced
in front of Mr. Saylor. Sometimes he just bent his
body so as not to obstruct the swing of Mr. Saylor's
fists when that gentleman threw them around in a
state of irritation and excitement. Sometimes he
was simply not there. At first it seemed an exhibi-
tion of politeness, but after a while it began to look
overdone and to smack of servility. Saylor went,
crusading round the ring, hitting the air, bashing
the ropes fiercely, hurling wallops at nothing in
particular, and Kay looked at him from behind, or
from up in the air, or from walking upside-
down on the roof, or any old place except the
front. The result was to make the. ringside darkly
suspect that Saylor was giving a vaudeville act of
bow a man behaves when he is chasing a swift
‘i'tten in the dark. Kay for the first 12 rounds hit
Mr. Saylor repeatedly, sometimes with his right glove
and sometimes with his left. He never hit very hard,
hut he did it frequently, and piled up a vast margin
of points that made it imperative for the hostile
torce to score a knock-out in order to win. And he
had as much chance of knocking out Kay as he had
of biffing the hind parts of a southerly
buster. On the other hand, Kay demon-
strated that he could hit when and how
he pleased. Had he had a knock-out wallop about
him Ins toe was cold meat at any moment : but if
hav had a knock-out wallop he had apparently left
it on the kitchen pip.no, or elsewhere. It was a
convincing demonstration of superiority, but it was
tar from being attractive. Your ringsider likes to
see blows struck, and Saylor did all the striking.
But on the rare occasions when his fists did fall on
Ivay that elusive sprite was in full retreat. It was
the swinging- door all the time, with the door very
much on the swing when the blow fell. Saylor lost
his temper, and small wonder. No one ever had a
more intense desire to biff his brother bore than
Saylor. He was full to the chin of warlike inten-
tions. For 20 dreary heats he scurried round the-
ring, across the ring, backwards and forwards and
round about, trying to overtake a man who seemed to
be always in some other part of Time and Space. Once
he stopped right in the middle and begged Kav to-
come and see him. And Kay called and banged
twice on the mouth and once in the eye, and then
tore away before Saylor could extend him the burn-
ing welcome he thought he had waiting. It was:
grotesque, also it was wearisome. Saylor’s famous,
or notorious occipital blow was not in evidence
Once he got hold of Kay and tried to hold him with
the left while he swung the right, but the strong arm
of Harald Baker removed the grip, and Kav evapo-
rated. For two seconds even the police couldn’t find'
hl ™- u was the most hurried night of Saylor’s life,
and yet there was probably never a night on which
he accomplished less.


LEARN TO BOX SKILFOLLY
AND BE A SURE WINNER!
m
A skilful boxer has a great advantage over his
opponent.
Because he applies his strength scientifically—does
the right thing at the right moment —takes good
care to reserve his powers, sees that his opponent's
blows lash the air or land on his gloves.
How unfortunate it'd be for you to engage a
skilful Boxer. Why, you’d be in doubt about a man
of your own weight and skill. Surely, you ought
to cease being a target for a good Boxer.
Learn to be a skilful Boxer. There's no reason
for you to remain “crude.” 1 can teach you in
your own home.

“0.K.”: The worshippers of Norman
Brookes must have smiled aloud when they
heard recently that the Lancet had
announced the “discovery” of a complaint
known as “tennis elbow,” producing
periostitis of the external epicondyle, and
due to strainiensis at the bend of the right
arms. Why, the term “tennis elbow” must
be almost as old as the game that causes it.
Some years ago the present scoffer, being
then no longer a chicken, started to pat balls
over the net and over the fence, and, after
three months of belated enthusiasm for the
game, his efforts became painful to himself
as well as to the Onlookers. The mere rais-
ing of his- arm to miss the ball was fraught
with bad language. Then he learned from
a previous sufferer that “tennis elbow” was
the matter, and there was nothing for it but
rest cure. It had come as naturally as pain
in the legs comes to an alderman who is
learning to play marbles. Nobody wanted
to know that it produced, or was due to
periostitis of the external epicondyle. Pre-
sumably the tennis player who started to
wield a racquet in childhood and has a natu-
ral aptitude for serves, drives, Volleys,' etc.,
can go through life with his epicondyle in a
normal condition. Anyhow, tennis elbow. is
as reasonable an ailment as still: neck, which
onlv hurts when you try to glance over your
shoulder. “O doctor ! I get such a pain in
my arm when I hold it up like this,” moaned
the old lady patient to Dr. Abernethy. “My
good woman, don’t hold it up like that,”
roared the famous medical adviser of common
sense.

“ Yes, It Gives a Queenly
Complexion Quickly, Surely.
TOILET TALKS.
mi IE average woman of to-day is usually
_L satisfied if her complexion is passably
prettv, little knowing that an exquisite skin
is now within her reach, providing she has
the good sense to stop using cheap made-up
preparations, and adopt what has now be-
come known as the mercolised wax habit.
It is a pity that every woman in the land
cannot be apprised of this simple method.
The few to whom its virtues are already
known have complexions that are the envy
of all their friends, and. as is usually the
case, the nrajority of them rid use to divulge
the secret. However the formula has now
been verified, and known as
mercolised wax. Enquiry at
several chemists' shops has re-
sulted in ascertaining that this
substance has been known to
the select few for some years as
a complexion beautifier. but it
is only until quite recently that
it has been used to any extent
for this purpose. It was also
explained how mercolised wax
renews the complexion, but as
this is rather technical it is not
proposed to repeat it here. It
will be sufficient to say that
through some peculiar action the
wax absorbs the dead and dis-
colored outer cuticle, revealing the fresh
young complexion which every woman has
underneath. The process occupies about ten
days, and the change is so gradual and im-
perceptible that no discomfort whatever is
caused. The treatment is perfectly harm-
less, and the wax may be used as often as
desired.
•VTOW what about that shampoo? Pre-
sumably like a good many others you
follow blindly in the beaten track, without
a moment’s thought as to where it will
eventually lead you. It is an impossibility
to expect the same make of shampoo to suit
each individual head of hair. In some cases
it would take out too much of the natural
oil, and in others not enough. Fair folks
require a milder shampoo than those with
dark tresses; therefore the logical course to
m
pursue is to make your own slmmpoo and
graduate the strength according to the sus-
ceptibilities of your hair. The brush will
tell you whether you are treating the hair
properly. Like a plant in congenial soil the
hair will grow and flourish providing the
conditions are right: blit abuse it as most
women do by washing it. with some strong
alkaline solution and the effect is practically
the same as if you poured weed-killer over
growing plants. Before leaving the subject
I should like to mention that a few months
ago my local chemist recommended me to try
i idinary stallax in place of the usual made-
up powders, and I must say that
this substance, to my mind,
forms an ideal medium for the
purpose mentioned. If anything
it makes the hair rather too
fluffy and wavy, but some folks
prefer it so.
IT is astonishing the number
of women who suffer from
the humiliating affliction of
superfluous hair, and I am sorry
to say that through ignorance
or wrong treatment, the majority
of them have made matters con-
siderably worse by causing the
hairs to grow more quickly and
stronger than before. It only requires
a little thought to realise the folly
of it all. Removing the surface growth
for a few days may give temporary
relief, but in order to obtain per-
manent results the hair roots must be
killed. Caustic depilatories are worse than
useless, and on no account should the
hairs be pulled out. Apart from the
electric needle, which is a costly and pain-
ful process, any chemist will tell you
that the best home treatment is pure pow-
dered pheminol, which has . a devitalising
pffect upon the hair roots, in addition, to
which it removes all trace of the objection-
able hair in a few seconds, and the
recommended treatment gradually, but surely,
dissolves out the hair follicles, which
is the only method of permanently ridding
oneself of this terrible disfigurement. [8

The Timaru llfrald (M.L.) lately celebrated its

was as clean as the facsimile, it was good work.

“Jeames”: As an informative source the Sydney
Telegraph is a deception and a fraud. I deduce
this from the fact that whenever it discourses on
some overseas topic of which I have the least know-
ledge it is liable to be wrong. On Thursday last,
for example, it announced that the woman who
stabbed the Russian monk Rasputin “was a fanatical
follower of the monk at Iliodor.” There is no such
place as Iliodor. However, Iliodor is the name of another
monk, who appears to be a sort of rival to Rasputin.
He has for some time past been playing Potts to
Rasputin’s Slurk. According to the Cri de Paris
(16/5/’l4), he has not washed for 14 years, and he
claims to be able to raise the dead —possibly by sitting
down near the dead and allowing the wind to blow
across him and on to the remains. The next day the
Telegraph said that Jack Johnson had “agreed to
give Owen Moran, who was recently defeated by John-
son, 40 per cent, of the gate, provided Moran lost
in eight rounds.” Owen Moran has never fought
Jack Johnson, and it is a million to one he never
will. He is a lightweight, about sft. high, and a
back number as a boxer, anyhow. And 24 hours
later the misguided sheet weighed in, in two places,
with good old “medio lutissimvs ibis.” and on both
occasions spelt the last word “ibus.” It is such hap-
penings as the that help to blast one’s faith in
human nature and make one realise that educative
institutions arc as grotesquely fallible as political
parsons.
* * « *
Another starling, will shortly flutter into the Inky
Way. A new industry—the search for petroleum in
Australia —calls for a paper to publish its progress;
so the Oil News of Australia will appear next
month as a weekly penn’orth. The prospectus states
that its objects are “to make known the petroleum
resources of Australia ; to publish information about
petroleum mining: to record the development of the
petroleum industry, the most important to Australia
since the discovery of gold; and to collect, news
about petroleum mining from other States and coun-
tries.” The paper will be illustrated and educative,
and will be conducted bv George D. Mendel], who
lias recently acquired the bad habit of forming cos.
to look for oil.
F re d Johns, who is to be chief of South Australia’s
recent]v-established Hansard staff, has padded along
the Inkv Way in Adelaide for 28 years, and is
known world-wide, particularly to newspaper men, as
the compiler of Notable Australians (the Who’s
Who of the Commonwealth), or, as the publication
is now known. Fred Johns’s Annual. Arriving
from England as a lad of 16, Johns signed on with
the Register, and has been there ever since. He
had been through practically all grades of the
paper exacting editor and proprietor. It is not
undulv difficult to become an editor for one's sins,
but extremely rare to become a proprietor for one’s
virtues. So Johns saw no use hanging on to the
old address any longer. Hansard and his biographi-
cal notes (he is allowed to continue publishing them)
will occupy most of his time now. The rest of his
time he will sleep and eat. When ihose matters are
attended to he will have no time left.
THE AG. COL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Stuck somewhere near the things For Sale,
Or “Vacant' Jobs” or else “To Let,”
My paper has a little space
Where cries of loneliness are set
In cold black type. Deserted grief
And lover’s message here confine
Themselves in language very brief —
The charge is sixpence for a line.
’Tis here I learn an “Honest plain
Yg working man,” who’s Scotch and I’rct..
“Good wages, eon. emp.,” would attain
A helpmate who can not be got
Amongst the many girls he knows.
I wonder what has been his fate
That this bis ad. far-seeking goes
An lion. dom. worn, of thirty-eight.
Here, too, I meet the folk who seek ■
Someone “with means, refd., v. to mat.."
To catch their whale, with ‘ splendid cheek,
They try this bait, a double sprat!
Some ads have an addendum, too,
“No triflers app. or P.O. adds.
Which shows the advertisers who
Have been before amongst the “bads.”
Then a “refd. lady, little inon.”
Desires to share her trifling lot
With “man, dom. liab.,” who must be “bon.”
She may be fair or she may not;
She may be all her short words say—-
“Mas., happy <1 is.” —I know that she
Cannot be younger by a day
In years than- well, say twenty-three.
Rut “mat.” is not the only thing
That people in this column seek.
“Dear Love” has word from “Wedding Ring"
At very least three times a week.
While someone pleads to “Darling Pat’
“Do not believe them. Write to me”;
A hint of chequered romance that
Explains itself quite easily.
And then there’s he who’s lost the ’bus.
“Missed boat. So grieved. Same place, time,
Mon.”
I wonder if lie’s serious
Or has he to the show-horse gone
With someone else, while in the wet
Poor Dulcie lingered in despair?
Or on the night of his regret
Was Dulcie really waiting there?
Here mystery with sable mask
Lurks also, as in things like this;
“Nodded your little girl friend. Ask
Pigeons on damages.” Here is
A hint to the romantic mind
Of secret love, or deeds of fear
Though search an urgent hint might find
To hide the loot away, and clear.
Old Don begs Little Don to write.
“Broke up; forget the past.” he says.
One seeks a son to come to light
That he may keep him all his days;
And one, whose hard blows drove away
His wife—with meekness fit for Heaven
Pays eagerly his hob to say :
“Return home; fear not; all forgiven”!
And underneath —a satyr's jest—
The expert searchers have their say ;
Their ads. are bigger than the rest.
It is, no doubt, their ads. that pay!
Like sequels grim they follow on
The other things; T most note that
What time I scan “Dear, same place, Mon.,”
And such things, and the “view to mat.” !

Australasia put up a world's record last year
when it robbed its sheep of their overcoats and
found, according to a calculation made by Dalgety’s
for their annual review, that the stolen clothes
weighed 71b. 14oz. as an average. This is inclusive
of lambs’ apparel. Australasia never made such a
haul as that before; and Dalgety’s can't find that
any other country ever got within speaking distance
of the figure. The clip was worth 6s. id. per head
or carcase, so that a cocky with a mixed average lot
of a mere 600 got from his wool crop alone £l9O.
And the beautv of this sort of crop is that the
cocky doesn’t have to. plough the sheep, or plant
wool-seed or buy fertiliser; and the beast is just as
likely to grow a good crop if it isn’t run over by
harrows or a roller. Meantime the price of chops
has been steadily rising; moreover, the lady sheep
has been attending to family matters while she has
been growing her six-and-fourpence worth of wool,
and the infant is worth anything up to half a
sovereign almost as soon as it can find a thistle for
itself. Taking all these circumstances into account,
it isn’t surprising that the sheep-man, as a rule,
buys motor-cars by tbe gross nowadays. His wool-
clip alone was worth £34,959,463 last season.

“G.”: “11.5.” (B. 28/5/T4) exults in the killing-
out by the taxi of the ragged London horrors known
as cab-runners, lie will be plunged into misery
to learn that the pestilence has taken anew lease
of what passes for life. Finding he was left a bad
also-ran by the speedy taxi, the cab-parasite retired
to the nearest pub, where, sitting back among his
rags, he sought inspiration in much beer, the passion
for bag-carrying still burning fiercely within him.
The result is that, on a bievcie shrieking for lubri-
cation, his eyes glaring horribly, his rags fluttering in
the wind, and his legs working like piston rods, he
propels the patched tyres through the dust in the
wake of the taxi. The destination reached, he
oozes sweat and mud, and gaspingly solicits the job.
and “hlarsts horfully” if refused. So if “H.S.”
wants to escape the fiend on his next visit to Uncle,
he will have to take his trunks home from the
station per flying machine.

“Hamer”: A variant of an old swindle came off
in Sydney a week or so back. The game is to order
goods to be sent, to be paid for on delivery, to a
first-class hotel, club or boarding-house. Someone
on the lookout receives the goods, asks the messenger
to wait, and, by the time he is tired of waiting,
there is nothing he can collect but the information
that the stranger is unknown. The latest dodge
was practised by some tricksters who alleged that
they were representatives of a committee of Customs
officials, who had collected £2O to make a presenta-
tion to one of the staff leaving for England. They
chose a dressing-case that ran to about the
amount, and requested that someone should bring it
to an hotel where a meeting was to be held, in order
that it might be inspected by the committee. The
men met the shopman at the hotel, and asked him
to wait while they took the bag into the meeting-
room. He is still waiting.
“The Oldest” : Farmer and Cos., of Sydney, recently
bought some old properties fronting George and
Market streets, which are to be demolished. Some
of these buildings are historic in a trade sense. It
was at No. 440 that John Sands in 1837 established
the business which now covers much floor space in
various parts of Sydney. lie remained there until
1848, when he removed to premises adjoining the
old post office, and the firm still occupies the site.
Another of the buildings, the Savoy Hotel, was for-
merly the City Theatre, opened in 1842. In the most
easterly of the others Ben Mountcastle, a teetotaller,
sold hats, and with each hat the customer got a tem-
perance tract. Where Blow's Studios are Hawley
and Cos , the ironmongers, used to be. They were
the pilot fish of the Holdsworths, who are still in
that trade. The Ilawleys were the legitimate succes-
sors of Tom Burdekin and J. S. Uther, the first big
ironmongers in Sydney. The latter were on Roberts’s;
corner until about IS4O, when the Crown and Anchor
pub was opened there by Thomas Baker. The
Roberts family got it in the first 'so’s, and have had
it ever since. After C. .T. Roberts had been Post-
master-General he was made a C.M.G., in honor, it
was said, of his pub at the corner of Market and
George.

. It is really marvellous the headway Sosh is mak-
ing, quite unknown to the vast majority. Since
starting business in Britain in 1908 that useful
official, the Public Trustee, has administered 6000
estates, valued at £50,674,855, and has applications
in hand from 3438 intending testators. So the
business handled and in sight in less than six years
runs to £110,000,000. After being charged with
every expense incurred, the office comes out with
a credit balance of £23,835. The first year the
income was only £6577 ; last year it had soared
to £55,283.

Socialism in a. new form has been raging in
Christchurch (M.L.) for some time, much to the
general convenience and satisfaction of everybody.
It is in the form of a special messenger service by
motor-cycle run by the Telegraph Department. By
calling the bureau on the telephone you can have a
smart boy in uniform, mounted on a modern motor-
bike, sent round, and can keep him going delivering
letters, small parcels or carrying messages for the
extremely reasonable tariff of 2s. 6d. per hour.
Everyone seems to have rushed the new service with
work —business firms, suburban housewives, the love-
lorn with a box of roses for Thelma, and the press
with “copv” accumulating at a distant sports
ground. In fact the infernal device has become one
of the greatest conveniences in the flat city.
In the large towns of U.S A.. Britain and Con-
tinental Europe the morning milk-jug on the back-
door step and the milkman with his can and measur-
ing instrument are unknown. The milk arrives daily
in sealed pint and quart bottles, and the carter who
delivers it takes away the empty bottles of yesterday.
The filling of the bottles every morning used to be
a problem to the big milk concerns, but some genius
has produced a machine to overcome delay. It re-
quires only two men —one t 6 operate it. the other to
feed it; with clean bottles —and it fills 7680 bottl.es an
. hour. Each machine has a separate carrier for each
size of bottle, and at every operation it fills 12
quart bottles and 20 pint; ones. The machine -neks
up a carrier of empty bottles in a human-like wav-
moves it into place, and lifts it against a battery of
spouts, from which the milk pours.j When full the
bottles arc lowered and carried along to an apparatus
that automatically caps each bottle and then dis-
charges the whole lot upon a Car. From there the
bottles are delivered by travelling belts either to a
cool chamber or to delivery waggons. If the con-
sumer finds water in the .milk he knows it didn’t get
m through the milkman /accidentally leaving the can
uncovered in the drought.
“N. or M.”: If you are after a text foi
a sermon on commercial dishonesty, use tin-
shimmering- stuff sold by the rag emporiums
under the name of silk. Some of it, of
course, is silk, but I nut several handsome samples
to the ordeal by fire t’other day, and precious
few showed an unblemished descent from the silk-
worm. Of some, the warn only was consumed ; others
merely lost color and gloss as the flame licked them.
Probably the fake material is made of spun glass
with admixtures. Whatever it is, it takes a fine
lustre and cuts when folded sharply. Frocks made
from it might appropriately be labled “for one night
only.” Possibly the Commerce Act is complied with,
but, as a matter of decent trading, the importation
of the fraudulent stuff should be prohibited.

WOLF
Patent
Superheated
STEAM LOCOMOBILE
THE LAST WORD
IN
MODERN SUPERHEATED STEAM ENGINE CONSTRUCTION.
In regard to durability, reliability, steady running’
and adaptability. Wolf Superheated Steam Locomo-
biles at least equal the best steam engine or turbine
plants of several 1000-h.p.
Their superiority in economy is attained by their
faultless construction, and in obviating the many
losses, including radiation, etc., which are unavoid-
able in steam plants having separate boiler and
engine.
Over Suction Gas Plants, Oil and Gas Engines. Wolf
Locomobiles possess the following advantages
Cheaper cost of fuel; great reserve of power, allow-
ing overloads up to 50 per cent.; steadiness in run-
ning under extreme and sudden variation of load; use
of any kind of fuel besides coal; utilisation of steam
for beating or manufacturing purposes; easy attend-
ance, even by unskilled hands; Absolute Reliability
and Greater Durability; greater simplicity and con-
tinuously maintained economy also at lower loads.

A REMARKABLE COUGII SYRUP RE-
CIPE THAT SAVES ABOUT TEN
SHILLINGS ON READY-MADE
COUGH MEDICINES.
As there seems to be a tegular epidemic
of colds and influenza at the present time,
the following recipe will be welcomed. by
many. Secure from your chemist 2oz. min-
tol (triple extract), and add to it 1-pint bt
hot water and 11b. of granulated sugar ?
stir until well dissolved and mixed. Take
one teaspoonful four times a day; this will
give instant relief, and will usually cure the
most obstinate cough within 24 hours. This
cough syrup is very pleasant to take; is most
excellent for sore throat, slight colds,, and
as a preventive against the more serious
affections of the respiratory organs, such as
consumption and pneumonia, which develop
so frequently from these troubles. As it
possesses also certain nourishing and
strength-giving elements, it is most suitable
for the convalescent stage. If you do not
go youtself to the chemist, instruct your
messenger that he must ask for the triple
extract of mintol.*

About Trusts and Sundries.
Dear Bulletin, —I grow weary—dead,
dead weary—of ail (his talk about the Meat
Trust and humble creatures of that sort,
which conversation is tearing the Federal
election business asunder. At its worst, the
Meat Trust is buying up Australian stock
at good prices and exporting it. This bul-
lock export helps to pay for our enormous
and absurd imports, and to cover the inter-
est on our foreign liabilities. The country
is still dropping more and more deeply into
debt. It does so little work in proportion to
its craving for pleasant luxuries, and it
buys from abroad so many nice things,
and sells abroad so few things to balance the
account, and borrows so much to postpone
the evil day, that one imagines things could
hardly be worse. Yet if somebody—a Trust
or some other institution—didn’t forcibly
shove extra meat or other substances out of
the country to pay for our inrush of foreign
luxuries, things assuredly would be worse.
It would be a thousand times better to deal
first of all with the Trusts whose goods we
import.. They take heaps of money out of
Australia while the exporting Trusts put
some - money into it. The worst that can
be said of the latter is that they don’t put in
so mtich money as they should do. The ex-
porting trusts supply much work and wages
for Australians' even if they do cut the
vs res rather fine in proportion to the amount
of toil done. The importing Trusts rather
tend to destroy work, and the best that can
be said for them is that they pay very scanty
remuneration to the most useless classes in
the community—tbe middleman’s clerks, and
the counter-jumpers, and the shop-walkers.
Fven the people who are most concerned
about exporting Trusts only allege, so far,
that there is one of them —the Beef concern
—operating largely in Australia. (Though
this is hardly correct, for a certain big
foreign banking Trust has been operating in
Australia for 70 years or more, and has ex-
ported dividends ranging as high as 36 per
cent.) As regards the importing Trusts we
don’t know how many they are, but they
are certainly more numerous than the
Beef combination. The protest has com-
menced at the wrong end. All manner of
people who approve of the foreign banking
Trusts, and foreign money-lending Trusts,
and foreign importing Trusts, and foreign
fire insurance office Trusts, which only take
money out of Australia, make a silly and-
dreadful pretence of virtue by complaining
that the Beef Trust doesn’t put quite so
much money into this community as it
should do. The Freetrade and fiscal-sinking
business makes me exhausted.

AT REHEARSAL.
MISS P ORTESQUE: “A very particular friend of mine” —
THE STAGE MANAGER (cutting in): “ ' Scuse me , dear, no friend of yours, could be."
The sun of Queensland is q fine tanning
for toughness. A prisoner travelling by
train to Brisbane under arrest was allowed
to enter the lavatorjf. In five minutes he
had slipped out through the narrow window,
and the police have not found him yet. Still,
he was only 60, and the train was dawdling
qt -30 miles an hour. Had he, been 80 and
travelling by a 60-mile-an-hour express the-
chances ar.e he would have been badly
scratched.
There seems to be a curse attached to. the
ships which carry the material for lighting
the Queensland coast. First, a couple of
months ago, the Waipara was pulled up,
lyith much violence, by a speck for which it
was carryipg a light that was to be erected
to warn off trespassers. Next, the schooner
Forbes Brothers, which was crammed with
some of those lighthouses for which mariners
have waited long, blasphemous years, hurled
itself at Rocky Islet, off Cape Capricorn,
and came off second best. Who knows but
that the spirit of some ironical mariner,
dead of the sick heart which comes of hope
deferred, has come up for a breathing spell,
and takes a trick at the wheel again? How-
ever it is, the incidents match the stranding
of a ship that was full of picnicking pilots,
off the south, coast of England, some years
ago. V i
“Rangan”: The Australian Meat Export
Co. recently faced the light of the Meat Com-
mission at Brisbane, and mentioned that the
capital of the co. was £200,009, nearly all of
which was held by Swifts, of the United
States. A few shares are held in Aus-
tralia, some by Thynne and Hensley, of
Sydney. About £400,000 has been spent on the
Brisbane works. Also, £250,000 is to be put
into the Alligator Creek works. The half-
million-odd pounds outside the capital has
been provided by Swifts at interest. The
management denied any connection outside
its Brisbane and Alligator Creek works, but
admitted having priced nearly every other
meat factory in the State. It forgot to tell
the Commission what are its intentions for
the future, and that is really what Banana-
land wants to know.
The admiration for the Asiatic, though
mostly kept below the surface these days,
dies hard in the heart of Australia’s Tory
writers. Occasionally it belches forth, as it
did in Maoriland the other day, from W. J.
P, Gaudin —who was at different times op
the, S. M. Herald and that other grand old
crusted organ, Brisbane Courier. Said he
to Wellington Dominion (another of the
Courier family) of the brown people in
North Queensland: —
Most of the Japs, are smart, well-educated and
well-dressed fellows —they are no miserable aliens, I
can tell you. They think themselves every bit as
good as the white man, if not better ; they all speak
good English, and are the type that are going to
push themselves to the front. The average slow-
gqirig, good-natured, lazy Queenslander is a fool to,
the Jap, and he generally knows ijt.
Gaudin certainly adds novelty to the old
gags. For instance, he explained tp the
interviewer that in the Gulf country and
along the North life is loose and cheap,:—
The, brown men and the yellow mingle with the
whites from all over the world, and the knife and
revolver play as ordinary a part in a man’s equip-
ment as does a fountain-pen with a business man.
And yet this bloodshedding land contrives to
have almost the smallest depth-rate in the
world ! Do these wild shooters and stabbers
always miss ? <.

QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 25, 1914.
My Dear Thargomtndah,—
The Arthur Morgans made their first
official appearance this week. They did it
twice : —once at the annual meeting of the
Lady Lamington Hospital and once at the
annual meeting of the Hospital for Sick
Children.
The last-mentioned institution held its
annual children’s plain and- fancy dress ball
on Thursday night, but most of the children
I saw dancing looked as though they should
be lawfully on the electoral rolls. The bona
fide infants had mighty little floor space
and less supper-table space. The Arthur
Morgans, Mayor and Mayoress Jenkinsmi
and Minister for Agriculture John White
occupied the seats of the Pharaohs, which
were on the stage.
Other hops of the week included the
Corinda Private Assembly, the Excelsior
Ladies’ Swimming Club, the Queensland
Flying Squadron Ball, the Art Students’
Ball and the “Coo-ee” Assembly Ball.
Two more tea parties were given at the
Art Society’s show this week. Mrs. Atthow
was hostess on Tuesday, and on Friday Mrs.
John Forrest and Mrs. Lockhart Gibson
entered into a treaty to liquidate the bill
for tea and buns.
Yesterday was Wattle Day. At every
corner white-clad girls, palpitating matrons
and shrill-voiced children pursued the bound-
ing public with badges or with scraps of
blossom. About £250 was cadged, so that
the art scholarship, for which the cadge was
perpetrated,, is an assured thing. Daphne
Mayo, the first winner of the scholarship,
sold blooms at the Mayoress’s stand at the
Town Hall. Mrs. Morgan and her daughter,
president “Jack” Bailey and energetic sec-
retary Mrs. Papi also bailed up the traffic at
this spot. Mrs. Edwin Kilpatrick and Mrs.
Collins pursued woman’s natural enemy in
a decorated war-cart, made to look less for-
midable by being enveloped in Australia’s
national vegetable.
Miss Spinney gave two or three recitals
this week. To-night she unloaded three
Irish plays by Yeates, but I can’t tell you
what they were like, since a stern lady of
the school-marm type greeted me on the mat
with the news that Miss Spinney would not
“allow” the intelligent press inside,, either
on or off a leash. Thus does the*weary
scribe get an occasional night off to enjoy
herself.
On Wednesday night the Women’s Resi-
dential College gathered in a handy sum as
a result of staging sundry tableaux. The
members of the Art Society took a big part
in the show, and Rudolf Augstein. a youth-
ful local poet, who wrote the prologue and.
epilogue, deserves to be taken into a corner
and have nice things whispered to him.
Winifred Burston, who has studied in
England and Europe how to cow a'piano, is
giving a recital in the Exhibition Hall to-
night. To anyone but the most inveterate
bones-spanker the programme • is-- a little
tiring, for never squeak of fiddle nor human
wail is to break the monotony! Winifred
certainly nlays very well —remarkably well,
in fact —but at her next concert she should
add a singer or a violinist to the show. Even
a wire-walker would be a diversion.
Pianist Elsie Hall (Mrs. Stohr) was the
guest of honor at the Women’s Club on
Thursday night, when Freda Bage lectured
on Distinguished Australian University
Women.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Bones” : The Meat Commission, at time
of writing sitting in Brisbane, has brought
to light various interesting facts. Notably
(1) Swifts control the Australian Meat Ex-
port Co., and Armour and Co. have interests
in Queensland firms; (2) the advent of these
two firms has sent stock prices up and glad-
dened the heart of the cattle man; (3) vari-
ous Queensland firms export to Armour and
Co., and either label their goods Armour and
Co. or send them without labels.
“Pick”: I don’t know whether it is the
advance feelers of the Meat Trust octopus
squirming over the land, or merely a local
attempt to corner our meat, but in my dis-
trict crossbred lambs that will not be dropped
until the lambing seasons of 1914-15-36 have
already been bought up, to any prospective
number, at prices up to eleven and a half
per head. So up to 1917, anyhow, the
present Ivosciuskan price of mutton will bo
maintained apparently, and incidentally
there exists a contributory menace to our
supply of jumbuck. Rearing lambs for
market, when prices are high, is the readiest
means the sheep man has of getting big
profits and quick returns, because the lambs
are lifted by the buyers at five or six
months, and have to be grassed only for the.
portion of that period when they do not sub-
sist on the mothers. If many sheepbreeders
go in for raising market lambs only, the
State’s stock of sheep, which, according to
the latest statistics (3932), shows a, tendency
to decrease, will by 1917 still further decline,
and we will need a few rungs on the
ladder to reach our mutton chop.

An Innovation of Parcel Deliver-
ies took place with Guillaux’s
flight from Melbourne to Syd-
ney. Mon. Guillaux carried
a parcel of the well-known

Lemon Squash consigned to

cial Travellers Club, Sydney.
This is possibly the first time
that merchandise has been
carried by aeroplane over such
a long distance in the world.
A Comparison of Progress.
No invention of recent years has achieved such remarkable results as the
aeroplane, nor has any drink achieved such a wonderful result as O.T.
No less than one hundred million drinks of O.T. is the yearly consumption.
Although only eight years since it was first introduced in' Melbourne, it is now to be found in
almost every part of the world.
The machinery of five large factories in Melbourne, London and Sydney
is strained to its utmost to keep ahead of the enormous demand. No other drink in the wide world
has obtained such a sale in so short a period; the merit of O.T. as a drink that gives warmth and
quenches thirst in the summer, has proved its worth. O.T. is used by the British Admiralty and
has the seal of approval of the British Pure Food Society (the highest recommendation of purity in
the world). Just the drink to warm yon during this cold weather; get a bottle to-day .
If you drink LEMON SQUASH, drink pure lemon squash.
O.T. Co.’s Lemon Squash is guaranteed with a thousand pounds that it is pure lemons and sugar
without added water.

a fool us to profess that N.S.AV. has “the largest debt

'the tramways of other capital cities are not all
“monopolised by good old Private Enterprise.’’ Perth,
Hobart and Adelaide all have publicly owned and
worked tramways. Melbourne has publicly owned
tramways leased to a Compaq’ whose term expires
in two years. And in Brisbane the tramways revert
to the public after a certain time. (3) Tin: Bul-
letin believes it is possible to get along without
foreign borrowing for several reasons: (a) The world
did it for several million 3'ears ; (6) England‘and
quite a number of other countries, which show much
less wealth per head than Australia, are doing it to-
day ; (e) a certain YV. A. llolntun got into otliee on
a promise that, after existing' commitments were
cleared oil, he would reduce borrowing (not double
or treble or quadruple it), and that he would borrow
only for works which would pay lull interest and

paper would hate to call \Y. A. Holman a complete
and unutterable liar... .Two Seas: You have a reason-
able complaint, but the person you complain of can’t

Although the sj'stem of “tacking” Bills is con-
demned by most Parliamentary authorities, there is
no law against it. A Bill could not be sent up io
the Upper House “month after month” without a
dissolution intervening, because a second Bill of the
same provisions may not be brought in after a first
Bill l-as been defeated in the same session. The
will of the people can, however, be urged as a
reason why the Upper House should pass a measure
previously defeated by dissolving the Assembly and
making the measure sought to be passed a promi-
nent cry at the general election, as was done by

Pocket Propelling Peneils
Made in a variety of charming styles, one of which is
here illustrated. This pencil has refills at the end.
Other styles, for writers who always like a sharp point
to their pencil, have a pencil sharpener at the end.
Others, again, have neither refills nor sharpener, and
' consequently cost less. Each pencil is perfectly made —
“ a thing of beauty, and a joy for ever.” The lead, which
is “ Knh-i-noor,” does not slip or break under pressure,
and one twist of the fingers brings it into action.
Too simple and too well made to get out of order.

Hitch Your Sleeping Schedule
to Big Ben
Big Ben will wake you early enough
for profitable before-breakfast action.
His gentle get-up call starts the day
with a flying start on thousands of
farms.
For your accommodation- he rings
TWO WAYS. He’ll get you up by
degrees or in a hurry. Set him either
way you wish —to give one long five-
minute ring, or ten short rings at one-
half-minute intervals, until you’re
wide awake.
He stands 7 inches tall; is triple-nickel plated
over a tested implement steel coat, the handsomest
and truest thoroughbred in the clock world. He
has big:, bold numerals and hands that show the
time plainly at a glance, large keys that anyone can
wind easily, and such a pleasant tone that you are
glad to get up when he calls.
Big Ben makes early rising easy. He’s the
leader of the early morning brigade. His cheerful
"good morning” ring calls millions of live people
to action. Thousands of successful farms are run
on a Big Ben schedule. He starts you off right in
the morning and keeps you right all day. l rom
"Sun up” to “Lights out” he regulates your day.
He’ll work for 36 hours at a stretch, and overtime
if necessary. The only pay he asks is one drop
of oil a year.
He is sturdy and strong —built to last a lifetime.
Yet under his dust-proof steel coat are the most
delicate “works.” That’s why his on-the-dot
accuracy has won him fame.
Big Ben’s wonderful sales are due to his having
"made good.” His biggest hit has been with folks
with the "make good” habit. He stands for
success —that’s why you’ll like him for a friend.
When 3,000,000 families find Big Ben a good
clock to buy, and 20.000 jewellers trove he’s a good
clock to sell, it’s evidence that he is worth 12/6
of your money. Suppose you trade 12/6 for him
to-day.
Big Ben is made in La Salle, Illinois, 17-S.l 7 -S. A ., by
iVestclox. His price is 12/6, postage 1/- extra.
If you cannot find him in your town, send a money
order to his makers’ Australian office, IVestclox,
03 Pitt Street, Sydney. They will have one mailed
to you at once by the nearest jeweller.

CONSTI RATION
Hunyadi Janos Natural Aperient Water will be found the safest and most
trustworthy remedy for Gout, Rheumatism, Liver Complaints, Indigestion,
Obesity, Hemorrhoids, and a host of other minor maladies that spring
from Constipation.
Take a wineglassful every morning on arising, before breakfast. It is
quite inexpensive, and all chemists sell it.
“Hamer”: A notice informing all and sun-
dry that the boss cannot he interviewed ex-
cept by appointment is now hung out in
front of the office of each N.S.M. fetate
Minister. It has the hearty disapproval ot
people like JBinks, who is vice-president ot
the Bogville branch of the P.L.L. (in the
Minister’s electorate), and thinks, at
first, that be is not one of the all and sundry,
but finds he is. The Labor Ministers started
with an honest endeavor to avoid any appear-
ance of “side,” and were pleased to welcome
their old political or industrial friends with-
out formality; but the thing was overdone.
The executive of the Drum Beaters Associa-
tion might decide offhand to see the Min-
ister for Noise and Discord, arrange a depu-
tation by ’phone and sail in. Sometimes
they did not even worry about the 'phone,
but soiled in all the same. Unions and
P.L.L. officials seemed to imagine that a
Minister’s main job was to receive them
whenever they chose to see him, and that
peculiar bounder who likes to show his (dose
acquaintance with someone of importance
burst in hourly upon messengers with his
“Iley, is Bill in? Tell him George wants to
see him.” The Union or political official,
however, was rather less a nuisance than the
casual constituent, who believes that a Labor
man should be 50 times more approachable
than a Liberal. Also, the innumerable un-
official person in search of a job for him-
self, or a relative, or a casual friend was an
almost hourly infliction. The Labor Min-
isters are a hard-working team, whatever
other virtues they may lack, and they had
to work harder because of the unarranged
visitor, who became slightly worse than a
nuisance when he burst in just when a pro-
perly-arranged deputation was due or an
official appointment had to be kept, and had
to be insulted before he would go. So, one
by one, the Ministers have adopted the closed
door; and the snorts of Binks and co. can be
heard to the effect that Labor Ministers have
jointly and severally “turned their backs on
the movement” —Binks and co. being, ot
course, the movement.
Ducal note by “Jeames” :
A London cable mentions the long-anticipated
burst-up of the Westminster menage. The young
duke was married, almost forcibly, to Miss Sheila
Cornwallis-West, by her mother —one of the Empire s
greatest matrimonial experts—towards the close ot
the Boer war. A citation in divorce pursued him
to the steps of the altar. He was one of the original
glittering bevy of co-re’s in the Atherton suit which
was stopped by Edward VII. Not till within a day
or so of the wedding did the multitudinous parties to
the proceedings know that they were not to figure in
court. Later on the Duke became a warm admirer
of Miss Gertie Millar, whose smile and voice and
winning ways generally have been imitated by dozens
of imported musical comedy young women in the
last half-dozen years. The duchess and her family
(her brother, by the way, is the young man whom
Lady Randolph Churchill recently passed on to Mrs.
Pat’ Campbell) stood the Duke’s vagaries patiently until
the other day, when, the Millar friendship having ended,
he became involved in several other directions. The
Spirit of Tolerance then fled with a despairing howl,
and it was resolved to Take Steps. Any move of the
sort will leave the Duke blandly unconcerned, and in
every respect captain of his soul, he not having been
near King George's Court for years, and having re-
peatedly expressed the view that a sojourn there is
about as attractive to a normal-minded man as an
attack of influenza. He was a remarkably handsome
youth 10 years ago, but a life of persistent merri-
ment has coarsened him somewhat. He is a first-
class polo-player and a noted rider to hounds, and
has never worked at anything else; a circumstance
accounted for. doubtless by the fact that his income
runs into hundreds of thousands per annum, and is
going to be greatly, added to when the leases of Bel-
gravia, practically the whole of which he owns, fall
in.
“Jynins”: The prominent citizen was
leaving the constituency, and a banquet was
arranged. The Minister proposed the toast
of the guest in a speech teeming with
bouquets. They’d never get over his de-
parture. It was a national loss. Every
man of them was suffering a personal be-
reavement. When the last head had been .
swallowed from the last glass, they fell into
groups, colloquing. “My oath, Mr. ,
I’d give anything to make a speech like
that,” said one. “Give anything.” said the
distinguished politician. “Why, I’d talk for
a week to get rid of such a damned humbug.”
The distinguished politician still holds a
seat, and throws the same bouquets and no
one has yet quite convinced him that there’s
any humbug about him.
Humorous description in the N. York
Police Gazette of the things Jimmy Clabby
may and may not do during the three years
lie has been sentenced by the Californian
court to be of good behavior: —
This sentence does not mean that he must be shut
up in the hatch house during the period of probation
referred to, but cannot take a drink of liquor. . He
cannot enter a place where such drinks are sold. He
must not associate with idle or dissolute persons.
Clabby is practically sentenced to eat in cafeterias,
sleep in private houses, and spend his hours of enter-
tainment in a theatre or a church.
He cannot belong to a club. He must not enter a
cafe. He must inspect the habits and callings of all
people with whom he comes ill contact. If they have
no vocation that is evident and honorable, if there he
a stain upon them, he must boycott them immedi-
ately.
For his guardian, to see that he restricts himself
to the liberties the court permits him, Jimmy Clabby
has City Prosecutor George L. McKeeby. Before
Clabby leaves the limits of Los Angeles he must seek
McKeeby’s permission. Every month he must report
to City Prosecutor McKeeby his conduct for the
month, and his plans for the next. Larney Lichten-
stein, former dictator in affairs of Clabby, becomes a
second man.
To make an early show of authority, and much in
earnest and some in jest, City Prosecutor McKeeby at
once ordered Clabby to give up his quarters in the
training camp occupied by him as a fighter at Jack
Doyle’s place in Vernon.
In the establishment where Clabby had been mak-
ing headquarters since his fight there liquor is sold,
and that tainted the place for Clabby.
He was forbidden to join any clubs and ordered
to withdraw his membership if he did belong to a
club, for in clubs there is liquor, and liquor means
prison to the prizefighter.
THE QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas when the bakers threatened strike —
When each man to the other said
On tram and ferryboat and train:
“To-morrow we may have no bread.’’
He sat beside me in the park,
A man who seemed on liquor fed,
And heard with features all amazed
The talk of horrid things ahead.
At last he touched me on my arm,
And, breathing rum upon me, said,
In tores that showed an anxious mind:
“What’s this ’ere drink these blokes call bread?’’

housework or washing. The pain was excruci-
ating : I tried all sorts of ointments on my hands
day and night, but it was no use. At last 1 tried
Rexona, and that ointment healed them rapidly.
My hands are now thoroughly cured.”

An Insanity of Love and a
Canvas Blind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
canvas blind was quite insane
And weighted with a heavy pole;
I clung to it with might and main
The while it kicked against my soul;
If once the raging tiling got free
It was the end of Jane and me.
Let me explain. The night was wild,
A fearsome gale blew down the bay.
The girl with dimples archly smiled,
And both her red lips seemed to say
That, sheltered by a canvas blind,
The bleakest balcony was kind.
The matter might have been all right
If Jane had been my special prize,
Drawn in life’s lottery at sight
To cheer my breakfasts with her eyes;
But our pure love was young as yet—
it was the first time we had met.
The various boarders in the place
With boresome chatter came and went,
Until the wonder of her face
A thrill through all my being sent;
Her hair was black, her eyes were wide,
And it was good to sit outside.
The balcony was high and dark
And reached by climbing up some stairs;
Our going there caused no remark
As, owing to those loud harsh airs,
The various gossips, flirts and bores
Were all content to stay indoors.
Of course the whole affair was wrong;
But was I all so much to blame?
Her voice was like a little song
A prize canary sings when tame,
And the red sweetness of her lips
•fell like hot wine in dainty sips.
Hot wine, perhaps 1 should remark,
Is not a liquid I admire;
But, sitting in the sheltered dark,
Her special brand and my desire
For something sweet to quench my thirst
Matched one another from the first.
The wind that swept across the bay
Came round the corners of the blind,
And blew her soft hair much astrav
Until its tendrils seemed to wind
Like moonbeams fingering a rose
Round the warm petals of my nose.
Her own nose was a thing so dear
That, where it brushed against my eye,
It tickled like the small and clear
Wing of a floating butterfly;
Her breathing was like fruit and spice—
In fact, the whole round girl was nice.
Excuse a fuller catalogue
Of all her graces, sweets and charms.
Most of the girl was like a fog
Of dreams and laces in my arms;
I know she had some feet and things
And small pink fingers rough with rings.
Close sheltered from the stormy night
We had a very pleasant time
In teaching youth and young delight
With such a circumstance to rhyme.
The wild winds howled like fiends in pain,
And someone came and yelled for Jane.
It was a most discordant note
That jarred the music gladness made,
Upon her tender ear it smote
And made her very soul afraid.
I crept a yard away from her
And hoarsely whispered: “Do not stir.”
No name is held to be so sweet
As “mother” when you breathe it low,
But mothers are not good to meet
In balconies when salt winds blow ;
In such a very stormy place
Jane’s mother had been hard to face.
There, with one yard ’twixt heart and heart,
We sat and heard the tempest roar;
Yet no one pulled the blind apart
Our place of hiding to explore ;
Upon the landing down below
Broad feet were walking to and fro.
The wind blew somewhat louder then,
The canvas gave a larger flap ;
Jane, patient as a brooding hen,
I. like a rabbit in a trap,
Waited with spirits sore and vext
To find out what would happen next.
What we expected least occurred.
A sudden blast of demon air
Bv all the pricks of conscience stirred,
Caught at the blind that hid our lair,
And, careless of our fears or hopes,
Burst the mad fixing from its ropes.
Our balcony was full of stir
That lately had been sweet with soul.
Jane crouched in fear, while over her
The wild ends of the loosened pole
Went kicking, leaping, dancing free,
Eager to smash both her and me.
I seized the wild thing in its flight,
I hung to it with all my weight;
The fierce wind shrieked in its delight,
And I regret to have to state
That idiot blind in its career
Was bad to hold and worse to steer.
It hurled me out and dashed me round,
My feet got tangled up with Jane.
It used my pants to sweep the ground,
And made me soar in flight again ;
Tossed on my lunatic trapeze
I banged my head and harked my knees.
Prancing on boards or treading air
According to the tempest’s mood,
I saw that on the midmost stair
Jane’s portly parent panting stood ;
Yes, she was coming up at last
Just as my boots to Heaven were cast.
There came a burst of thunder sound,
The canvas ripped and floated free,
And at a single. awful bound
The wild wind made away with me ;
But as I passed the highest stair
That woman caught me by the hair.
Away across the loud, wild night,
Above the houses high and black,
My battered body took its flight
With Jane’s large mother on its back;
For she had made her perch secure
And joined my airy craft on tour.
We broke our necks near La Perouse
Through falling on some slabs of rock ;
Though sand was near we could not choose
The situation of the shock;
The thing was simple at the end.
And there was nothing left to mend.
Next morn at breakfast lovely Jane
Thought of her mother’s awful fate;
She shed a tear of contrite pain,
And left her bacon on her plate—
Yes, in a simple, soulful mood
She left untouched her morning food.

PAT O’MAORI.
The Eternity of Turn-em-Down
Smith.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f I URN-EM Down Smith, most energetic
and pernickety of mining experts,
was bored. lie had been dead only a
week and had found Immortality uninterest-
ing. The heaven of the Revelation had
claimed him. but the superciliousness that
had marked his face on earth in presence of
an overboomed proposition had now
deepened to a set sneer. “ ‘Jasper Wall’
all right,” he said, “but I knew that tale of
pure gold as clear as glass was absolutely
impossible.”
lie turned a cold, gold corner, and a wind
with chopped ice in it blew his soul into
goose-flesh.
lie expressed his disappointment so pub-
licly that Peter took much trouble attempt-
ing to soothe him. "Do you like the jasper
sea, Mr. Turn-em Down?" lie asked, almost
nervously, for Smith’s reputation as a care-
fully discriminating engineer had preceded
him. “My dear sir,” replied Smith; “it’s
a contradiction in terms. Jasper is a form
of silica and a solid can’t be a sea.”
Peter was discountenanced by this, his
first experience of criticism; but Turn-em
Down seemed to have hypnotised him, and
lie listened while the dead expert pointed
out the shortcomings of the place pitilessly,
though dispassionately. “Do you see this
book, Peter V” said he. “It’s a guide book to
this field, and it’s full of inaccuracies. Who
was this John anyway? I pass over the
statement about four beasts full of eyes
before and behind and six wings. I didn’t
expect a freak museum, and I’m not dis-
appointed. Also I pass over that story of a
white-haired flame-eyed man with molten
brass feet and a voice like a waterfall and
seven stars in his right hand, girt about
with a golden girdle, and a two-edged sword
in his mouth.”
“But we have lamps,” said Pete eagerly.
“I know —the over-decorated Roman
shapes—but none of the beauty of Etruscan
forms.”
“Look at the dome above you—look at the
golden throne.”
“That gold is not worth more'than £2 10s.
an ounce,” said Smith.
“Ix>ok at the wall,” said he. “The first
foundation is of jasper and sapphire; the
second course is chalcedony, emerald and
sardonyx; the third of sardius, chrysolite,
beryl and topaz ; the fourth of chrysoprase,
jacinth and amethyst; and there are 12
gates of pearl.”
Smith waved his hand in weary protest.
“It's no use your hiding the sameness of
this under vast catalogues of words,” he
said. “Chrysolite and chrysobcryl are prac-
tically the same thing; amethyst is only
transparent silica —practically a pure, clear
quartz, and your onyx and sardonyx, and
chrysoprase, and chalcedony, and emerald,
and beryl are only pure alumina colored by
metallic oxides.”
“But” —-—
“All these words serve to confound the
ignorant, but it isn’t quite honest to use
them. This place doesn’t sound much when,
instead of all these Persian descriptions you
say merely ‘silica, alumina and metallic
oxides for coloring matter.’ ”
“Pardon me, I”
“Pardon me! If it was absolutely neces-
sary for the establishment to be siliceous
why in thunder didn’t you build it of crocy-
dolite?”
“Cro- —what? I never saw it.”
“I don’t suppose you did. I’ll prospect
around a bit and see if there is any, Man !
if you had a erocydolite wall it would wink
across Eternity like a big tiger eye made of
amber, silk, wine, honey and sunlight.”
“Really—you do go on”
“I know I do. Now I’ll tell you where
you’ve got to alter the reports on this pro-
position. They’re misleading as they are.
When you talk of the Chairman of the
Board sitting”
“The Chairman of the Board! Tut! Tut!
Dear, Dear!”
“The Chairman of the Board sitting in
smoke and flame behind four rams’ horns
on an altar, I know you’re making him
nebulous to save the trouble of defining
him, and you’re putting the smoke and flame
in to discount this polar bear wind. That’s
got to stop. If I’m made consulting engi-
neer to this concern I won’t have any wild
statements of that sort”———
“Really—l”-
“You listen. All this talk of the sea turn-
ing to blood and the stars to wormwood, by
which I presume you mean absinthe —and
tall tales of locusts as big ns horses —that
won’t do. Then this story of the Chairman
of the Board inviting the faithful share-
holders to dinner to eat the flesh of kings
and of captains, and mighty men—that’s
no use either.”
“We’ve always done it.”
“Then it’s got to stop. Your stock will
never be popular while you publish reports
like that. Your grey horse of conquest, and
your red horse of power, and your black
horse of anarchy, and your pale horse of
death make a picturesque paragraph, but
Hell following and the poor shareholders
struggling up against alleged revelation and
certain superstition—that will keep away
more than it attracts. If I take on this
consulting job I’ve got to alter all that.”
“Really.” said Peter. “There is no work
here for you. But,” he added with a hope-
ful gleam in his eye, “there might be a posi-
tion in the mining department.”
“Well, lead me to it. Where is it?”

HUSBAND, WIFE AND CHILDREN COVERED—NEARLY DRIVEN
CRAZY WITH IRRITATION—2 YEARS’ MISERY ENDED.
WHAT person, seeing the Towers family for the
first time, anti noting their clean, healthy
skins, would think that a snort time ago
father, mother and children were all ravaged by
that dreaded disease, eczema? But, thanks to the
excellent disease-destroying powers of Zam-Buk,
they all now enjoy perfect skin health. Speaking
of their terrible experience, Mrs. Elizabeth Towers,
2 Boyd Street, Richmond, Melbourne, Vic., says:
“We came from the country to reside in the town,
and the different climate and the great change in
diet considerably upset all our family. The conse-
quence was that we all broke out in a nasty rash.
This rash developed into terrible eczema. Myself,
husband, and children were all attacked by this
awful disease. I was covered with it almost from
head to foot, and felt as if I could tear myself to
pieces. The torture from the itching was almost
unbearable. All of us were afflicted in the same

way; not one of us eouhl Ret any sleep
at night. I felt like going mail, the
irritation was so dreadful, and 1 was
much worse than the others. Not one
of us could keep our hands oil' the
affected parts. The want of sleep af-
fected us all. and I was nearly half
dead.
“A doctor gave me a sleeping draught,
which brought me a brief respite from
all the agony of irritation in blissful
oblivion. My husband became very
bad, and it was pitiful to see him. For
weeks and weeks he was laid up, unable
to work, and the children could hardly
walk. We attended the hospital, but
although they tried many things,
nothing gave us the least relief, and we
became worse if anything.
“My eldest boy was practically smotli-
ered In disease. A pin’s point could not
lie placed between the affected spots.
We despaired of ever being well again.
For two years were we tortured and we
never thought the misery of it would
cease. When things seemed at their
worst, we read of some remarkable cures
of eczema by Zam-Buk Balm and Zam-
Buk Soap. We resolved to try this

treatment, purchased a supply, and all commenced It. In a
short time all of us were delighted to notice a wonderful dif-
ference. The irritation was ended and the soothing and healing
action of both the llalm and the Soap were felt. The inflam-
mation was drawn to a head, and all bad matter expelled. As
we persevered with the Zam-Uuk treatment, so we improved.
The sores were healed, we were able to sleep at night, and soon
were completely freed from a terrible disease. Now we all
possess fine, healthy skins, which are wonderfully clear and
without spot or blemish. Zam-Buk is truly a wonderful halm.”

A Remarkable Remedy.
Few medicines have met with more favor or accomplished more good than
Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy.
It has relieved more pain and suffering and saved the lives of more people
than any other preparation in use. One or two doses of it is enough to relieve
an ordinary attack of colic or diarrhoea. It has been used in many epidemics of
dysentery with perfect success.
Itrelieves bowel complaints in their most severe forms and is especially valu-
able for diarrhoea and summer complaint in children.

Whooping Cough
“The disease I most dread is* whooping cough,
for children are often permanently injured by
the awful straining of the cough. You should
never neglect it, and treatment should be started
at the first symptom. You cannot mistake the
symptoms: protracted coughing, worse at night; peculiar whoop; laboured
expectoration of mucus; apparent suffocation after coughing.
COUGH JBEMEBY
is a positive remedy for this disease—repeat the dose frequently, for if given
freely it liquifies the tough mucus, makes it easy to expectorate and counter-
acts any tendency towards pneumonia. There is no danger whatever from
whooping cough when Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is freely given.”

Peter lowered his thumb impressively.
“Down there, do you mean?”
“Yes.”
“So you dig Heaven out of Hell?”
“Yes.”
“Then there can be no difference?”
“There isn’t, except in energy. All the
energetic people are down there working.”
“1 see. I wondered where you mined all
this stuff. I’ve seen neither gneiss nor
mica slate, and yet you have sapphires. I’ve
seen neither talcose, schist, nor the various
metamorpliic rocks, and yet you have the
topaz and the emerald.”
“All from there.” Again the impressive
lowering of the thumb.
“Give me a card to the general manager,
and I’ll go at once.”
Peter sighed his relief from impending
hostile criticism. lie wrote the introduc-
tion, and then conducted his unwelcome
guest to a man-hole in the street floor. At
a signal the cover lifted from below. Smith
saw a ladder-way in the circular shaft—so
deep that the eye could not pierce to the
light far below. A grateful heat ascended
the shaft and became smoke in the wintry
air.
“Round shafts,” said Smith. “Sunk by
Chows, I suppose?”
At that Peter looked more helpless than
before.
Turn-em Down’s feet found the ladder.
With a “So-long” to Peter he descended the
shaft into the darkness.
“A terrible fellow,” said Peter, as he re-
placed the man-hole cover. “It’s just as
well I didn’t risk telling him that he couldn’t
come here any more, as only the building
gangs are permitted. But Smith descended
gladly, feeling the grateful warmth bringing
back his vitality, his energy, and the control
of his own brain.
* * * *
The card from Peter did not inspire much
respect. The general manager started Smith
as a trucker, and when he objected to that
gave him a job as shift-boss. In that posi-
tion he introduced so many reforms that
by-and-bye he was sent for to be instructed
not to make his energy a nuisance to others.
The eminent mining authority, waiting in
the outer office, saw a middle-aged man, bald
of head, pointed of beard, but with an all-
seeing eye and a beautiful brow, writing
feverishly.
Turn-em Down rubbed his eyes. It could
not be, and yet
“Could you tell me who the bald gentle-
man is?” lie inquired of a heavy-jowled,
frowning man, dressed in riding clothes, with
a heavy, double-breasted military overcoat
over them. His jaws were comedian-blue
from much shaving: his hat was two-cor-
nered, and worn with its widest aspect to
the front.
“That sir,” said the frowning man, “is
Shakspeare. Quite a great writer he was.”
“Shakspeare here?”
“Why not? All energetic souls come here.
Shakspeare prepares the mine manager’s re-
ports for publication.”
At that moment the bald man began to
declaim: —-
So, good, my lord, tho onyx quarry hath
A footage of two hundred for the week.
The overburden —given in cubic yards—•
Removed for the week is ninety-four.
Our mines of chrvsoprase, and sard and beryl—
Of amethyst and jacinth, topaz, agate—•
Are deepened in their great profundities.
Our goldmines yield the precious yellow dross
(Of which T wrote a deal while on the earth) —•
Two thousand tons milled for a thousand ounces.
The winze from number four is on the footwall,
And goeth down in ore that bulks an ounce.
And I. thy manager of mines, say so
And sign my name thus: “Michael Angelo.”
“Wonderful,” said Turn-’em Down Smith.
“But what a waste of genius.”
“It cannot be helped,” said the frowning
man, sadly. “This is the only possible outlet
for energy. That’s why we are all inter-
ested in keeping Heaven popular, though un-
finished. If no more buildings were required
we would have to cease operations. Terrible
to think of—imagine it —an eternity without
work!”
“I sympathise with you,” said Turn-em
Down Smith. “I’ve only recently come from
up there. The indolence scared me. I was
bored the second day. By the way —I haven’t
a card. But my name is Smith, Mining
Engineer.”
“l~ou are fortunate,” said the frowning
man, “to have had a profession that is of use
to you here. My trade was war, and I have
to take anything I can get. My name is
Napoleon.”
“I knew it,” said Smith. “And what do
they put you at?”
“I am in charge of the men at the onyx
quarry,” replied Napoleon bitterly. “It was
the best they could do for me. But Julius
Ca?sar is worse off. He is a timekeeper.”
At that moment Smith was called to his
interview with the general manager, and,
when the interview concluded, he, by
reason of his modern knowledge, was given
the charge of the gold production.
One of his first actions was to object to
the old and expensive style of removing, over-
burden and wash at the alluvial mines, and
the one-time manager, now the sub-manager,
a broken-nosed and choleric man, went away
to seek the boss and complain bitterly.
So there was another interview —practi-
cally a carpeting.
“What’s all this about?” said the general
manager, and the broken-nosed man an-
swered him.
“Mr, Smith has altered all my work. He
has stopped the removal of wash to the
water with shovels.”
“Will you introduce us?” asked Smith,
and the general manager replied: “Mr.
Smith—Mr. Michael Angelo.”
“Glad to meet you. Mr. Angelo,” said
Turn-em Down, and his gladness was
genuine. Angelo sulkily acknowledged the
introduction by a slight inclination of the
head.
“I have altered the work for the better.”
said Smith. “Why, the cost of handling was
ruinous. You get your foundry to work, Mr.
Satan, and I’ll put in a steam shovel that’ll
handle the whole thing for a shilling a ton.”
“It cannot be done,” said Angelo. “I
kiiow all about transport, and it can’t be
done.”
“You know all about transport! Why,
you brought two marble pillars from Carrara
for Cosimo Medici, and you couldn’t get them
to Florence. I saw them at Serravezza the
other day—overgrown with weeds. You
don’t know anything about handling dirt.
And, Mr. Satan, it’s too hard on the men.
I saw one chap to-day carrying 2cwt.”
That s nothing,” replied the proprietor.
, ” e have a stockbroker here and he’s carry-
ing 20,000 Chillagoe shares at 395. 3d.”
“Well, am I to do as I like?” persisted
Turn-’em Down.
The general manager moved uneasily.
Well—yes—l suppose so; but defer to Mr.
Angelo as much as you can.”
“I’ll do that all the time,” said Turn-’eui
Down. “I’m the quietest man in the
world while I can get my own way.”
“Y r ou see,” said the G.M., “cheapness of
effort isn’t desired. We work here for the
love of it, and, if you put in all these labor-
saving appliances there’ll be an unemployed
trouble and a Labor Bureau, and then these
agitators will get to work and there’ll be a
Labor party and a revolution and anarchy,
and all that sort of thing, you know.”
4< l know,” said Smith. “I’ll be careful.”
The steam shovel displaced 60 men, but
new works absorbed them. Then new trouble
was created by the installation of flying
foxes from the quartz mine to the mill. He
was carpeted again, and warned- of the
destructive effects of an energy which de-
stroyed other energies.
The First Agitator came into being. There
was even talk of a newspaper —The Asbes-
tos Gazette— to voice the general discon-
tent.
Between his pride of running all the works
with an up-to-date equipment and his dis-
like of anything which saved labor, and so
left some men workless and discontented, the
G.M. wavered in his decision as to the
Proper treatment of Smith. Until !
Michael Angelo sought the G.M. one day
and demanded reinstatement in his original
position on pain of Ijis resignation and sub-
sequent leadership of the revolutionaries.
“What was the matter?” he echoed. Every-
thing was the matter. Did the G.M. know
of their greatest quartz quarry—that moun-
tain of very crystalline quartz which was
used for quarrying (lie principal courses for
the walls of Heaven?
Yes. the G.M. did.
Well, this Smith said that the mountain
bulked sdwt. of gold to the ton, and was
too good to be used for building. lie pro-
posed to break down thousands of tons at a
shot, and steam-shovel it to the mill, crush-
ing with 11001 b. stamps.
“But,” said the G.M., “that would destroy
it for building?”
“Quite so,” said Angelo. “But this Smith
says it’s a bad building stone, and hard to
work; and he proposes to extend the walls
when required with concrete. In that way
he’ll put 2000 masons out of work.”
The G.M. turned pale. “He must be
removed. But, how? I’ll think a way out.”
Turn-’em-Down Smith cordially said
“Good-bye” to the G.M. and Angelo, and
Galvani and Brunei, and Fulton and all the
other principals of the staff ; took his sam-
pling pick in his hand and went out of Hell-
gate along the sinuous black track between
the asplialtum pits. At a turning of the
track he halted to shout to them. “See von
later! So-long!”
They watched him Until the distance swal-
lowed him.
“How did you persuade him to go?” asked
Angelo.
“Told him we wanted that stuff he is
always raving about —crocydolite.”
“But lie’ll come back.”
"'Will he? We’ll use all his machinery
to barricade the door. And no one will ever
get in again unless lie can prove he isn’t
Smith.”
And Michael Angelo went back to dis-
mantle the flying foxes and the steam shovel,
and to suppress the secret of dynamite, and
within a week there was not a soul out of
work, and the Agitators were as if Smith
had never been.
Labor-saving appliances are only appreci-
ated when men are doing the work they don’t
love.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IVTOW Wowser Winter, with his gamn.
Is come, upon our joys to stamp
With his goloshes, drab and damp.
The slit-up skirt he disallows,
He banishes the low-cut blouse
That once was wont our hopes to rouse.
In surfing-time our girls expose
Upon our beaches rows and rows
Of shapely limbs devoid of clo’s;
But now a leg is rare to see:
By Wowser Winter’s stern decree
No maiden may possess a knee.
In summer time each §iaid in view
Was lovely and transparent, too:
Bach one you saw you saw right through.
‘Now no emotion in us stirs:
Each curve and contour that is hers
Is smothered up in shapeless furs.
The slim, entrancing silhouette
That once upon the street you met
Is mackintoshed against the wet;
Her filmy trifles give no thrill:
She wears, because she fears a chill.
Drab bloomers that have got no frill.
No joy to you her presence brings ;
She wears, when close to you she clings,
So many thicknesses of things.
And when you clasp her close, aglow,
It is not her you have, you know:
The girl is buried far below.
And yet in summer there’s no doubt
That legs we well could do without—
There were so many legs about.
And in this wintry weather glum
How futile wowsing has become .
When legs are at a premium !
In summer lissom legs were cheap;
They didn’t make your pulses leap:
They didn’t keep you from your sleep.
And now that shapely legs are few
It’s curious what legs can do —
A glimpse of ankle thrills you through!
The market’s no more overstocked ;
By too much leg we are not mocked.
A low-cut shoe—-and I am shocked!
So Wowser Winter, please endure;
From malediction you’re secure:
You give to legs a new allure.
