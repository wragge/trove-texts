Ruth.
I.
ALL is well—in a prison—to-night, and the
warders are crying “All’s Well ! ”
I must speak, for the sake of my heart—
if it’s but to the walls of my cell.
For what does it matter to me if to-morrow I go
where I will ?
I’m as free as I ever shall be—there is naught in
my life to fulfil.
lam free! lam haunted no more by the ques-
tion that tortured my brain :
“ Are you sane of a people gone mad ? or mad in
a world that is sane ?”
I have had time to rest —and to pray—and my
reason no longer is vext
By the spirit that hangs you one day, and would
hail you as martyr the next.
Are the friends of my fancy less fair through a
window that’s narrowed and barred ?
Are the morning stars dimmed by the glare of the
gas-lamp that stands in the yard ?
No! And what does it matter to me if to-morrow
I sail from the land ?
lam free, as I never was free ! I exult in my
loneliness grand ! *
Be a saint and a saviour of men—be a Christ, and
they ’ll slander and rail !
Only Crime’s understood in the world, and a man
is respected—in gaol.
But I find in my raving a balm—in the worst time
has come to the worst—
Let me think of it all—l grow calm—Let me think
it all out from the first.
11.
Beyond the horizon of Self do the walls of my
prison retreat,
And I stand in a gap of the hills with the scene
of my life at my feet;
The range to the west, and the Peak, and the
marsh where the dark ridges end,
And the spurs running down to the Creek, and
the she-oaks that sigh in the bend.
The hints of the river below; and, away on the
azure and green,
The old goldfield of Specimen Flat, and the
township—a blotch on the scene ;
The store, the hotels, and the bank—and the
gaol and the people who come
With the weatherboard box and the tank—the
Australian idea of home :
The scribe—spirit broken; the “wreck,” in his
might-have-been glory—or shame ;
The townsman “respected” or worthy; and the
workman respectful and tame ;
The boss of the pub. with his fine sense of honor,
grown moral and stout,
Like the spielers who came with the “line,” on
the cheques that were made farther out.
the clever young churchman, despised by the
swaggering, popular man ;
The doctor with hands clashed behind, and bowed
head, as if under a ban ;
The one man with the brains—with the power to
lead, unsuspected and dumb,
Whom Fate sets apart for the Hour—the man for
the hour that might come.
The old local liar whose story was ancient when
Egypt was young,
And the gossip who hangs on the fence and
poisons God’s world with her tongue;
The haggard bush mother who’d nag, though a
husband or child be divine,
And who takes a fierce joy in a rag of the clothes
on the newcomer’s line.
And a lad with a cloud on his heart who was lost
in a world vague and dim—
No one dreamed as he drifted apart that ’twas
genius the matter with him;
Who was doomed, in that ignorant hole, to its
spiritless level to sink.
Till the iron had entered his soul, and his brain
found a refuge in drink.
m.
Perhaps I was bitter because of the tongues of
disgrace in the town —
Of a boy-nature misunderstood and its nobler
ambitions sneered down—
Of the sense of injustice that stings till it ends in
the creed of the push—
I was born in that shadow that clings to most old
gully homes in the bush.
And I was ambitious. Perhaps as a boy I could
see things too plain—
How I wished I could write of the truths—of the
visions—that haunted my brain !
Of the bush-buried toiler denied e’en the last
loving comforts of all —
Of my father who’slaved till he died in the scrub
by his wedges and maul.
Twenty years, and from daylight till dark—
twenty years it was split, fence, and grub,
And the end was a tumble down hut and a bare,
dusty patch in the scrub.
’Twas the first time he’d rested, they said, but
the knit in his forehead was deep,
And to me the scarred hands of the dead seemed
to work as I’d seen them in sleep.
And the mother who toiled by his side, through
hardship and trouble and drought,
And who fought for the home when he died till
her heart—mot her spirit—woremut:
I am shamed for Australia and haunted by the
face of the haggard bush wife—
She who fights her grim battle undaunted because
she knows nothing of life.
By the barren track travelled by few men—poor
victims of commerce, unknown—
E’en the troubles that woman tells woman she
suffers, unpitied, alone ;
Heart-dumbed and mind-dulled and benighted,
Eve beauty in girlhood destroyed !
Till the wrongs never felt shall be righted—and
the peace never missed be enjoyed.
There was no one to understand me. I was lonely
and shy as a lad,
Or I lived in a world that was wider than ours ;
so of course I was “mad.”
Who is not understood is a “crank ” —so I suffered
the tortures of men
Doomed to think in the bush, till I drank and
went wrong—l grew popular then.
There was Doctor Lebinski, my friend —and the
friend, too, of all who were down —
Clever, gloomy, and generous drunkard—the
pride and disgrace of the town.
He had been through the glory and shame of a
wild life by city and sea,
And the tales of the land whence he came had a
strong fascination for me.
And often in yarning or fancy, when the she-oaks
grew misty and dim,
From the forest and straight for the camp of the
Cossack I’ve ridden with him :
Ridden out in the dusk with a score, ridden back
ere the dawning with ten—
Have struck at three kingdoms and Fate for the
fair land of Poland again !
He’d a sorrow that drink couldn’t drown—that
his great heart was powerless to fight—•
And I gathered the threads ’twixt the long, preg-
nant puffs of his last pipe at night;
For he’d say to me, sadly : * ‘ Jack Drew ’’—then
he’d pause, as to watch the smoke curl—
“lf a good girl should love you, be true—though
you die for it—true to the girl!
“ A man may be false to his country—a man may
be false to his friend :
Be a vagabond, drunkard, a spieler—yet his soul
may come right in the end ;
But there is no prayer, no atonement, no drink
that can banish the shade
From your side, if you’ve sparkle of manhood, of
a dead girl that you have betrayed.”
IV.
“One chance for a fortune,” we’re told, in the
lives of the poorest of men—
There’s a chance for a heaven on earth that comes
once and never again !
’T was for Ruth, the bank-manager’s niece, that
the-wretched old.goldfield grew fair,
And she came like an angel of peace in an hour of
revengeful despair.
A girl as God made her, and wise in a faith that
was never estranged—
From childhood neglected and wronged, she had
grown with her nature unchanged ;
And she came as an angel of Hope as I crouched
on Eternity’s brink,
And the loaded revolver and rope were parts of
the horrors of drink.
I was not to be trusted, they said, within sight of
a cheque or a horse,
And the worst that was said of my name all the
gossips were glad to endorse.
But she loved me—she loved me! And why?
Ask the she-oaks that sighed in the bends—
We had suffered alike, she and I, from the blind-
ness of kinsfolk and friends.
A girlhood of hardship and care, for she gave the
great heart of a child
To a brother whose idol was Self, and a brother
good-natured but “wild” ;
And a father who left her behind when he’d
suffered too much from the moan
Of a mother grown selfish and blind in her trouble
—’t was always her own.
She was brave, and she never complained, for the
hardships of youth that had driven
My soul to the brink of perdition, had but
strengthened the girl’s faith in Heaven.
In the home that her relatives gave she was tor-
tured each hour of her life
By her cruel dependence—the slave of her aunt,
the bank-manager’s wife.
Does the world know how easy to lead and how
hard to be driven are men ?
She was leading me back with her love, to the
faith of my childhood again !
To my boyhood’s neglected ideal—to the hopes
that were strangled at birth,
To the good and the truth in the real—to the good
that was left on the earth.
And the sigh of the oaks seemed a hymn, and the
waters had music for me
As I sat on the grass at her feet, and rested my
head on her knee ;
And we seemed in a dreamland apart from the
world’s discontent and despair,
For the cynic went out of my heart at the touch
of her hand on my hair.
Y.
She would talk like a matron at times, and she
prattled at times like a child :
“I will trust you—l know you are good—you
have only been careless and wild—
You are clever—you’ll rise in the world—you
must think of your future and me—
You will give up the drink for my sake, and you
don’t know how happy we’ll be !”
“ I can work, I will help you,” she said, and she’d
plan out our future and home,
But I found no response in my heart save the
hungry old craving to roam.
Would I follow the paths of the dead ? I was
young yet. Would I settle down
To the life that our .parents had led by the dull,
paltry-spirited tbwn ?
For the ghost of the cynic was there, and he
waited and triumphed at last —
One night—l’d been drinking, because of a spectre
that rose from the past—
My trust had so oft met betrayal: at last I had
turned to distrust—
My sense of a wrong was so keen that my anger
was always unjust.
Would I sacrifice all for a wife, who was free now
tb put on my hat
And to go far away from the life—from the “home
life ” of Specimen Flat ?
Would I li\e as our fathers had lived to the
finish ? And what was it worth ?
A woman’s reproach to the end—of all things
most unjust on the earth.
The old rebel stirred in my blood, and he whis-
pered, ‘ ‘ What matter ? ” “Why not ? ”
And she trembled and paled, for the kiss that I
gave her was reckless, and hot.
And the angel that watched o’er her slept, and the
oaks sighed aloud in the creek
As we sat in a shadow that crept from a storm-
cloud that rose on the Peak,
There’s a voice warns the purest and best of their
danger in love or in strife,
But that voice is a knell to her honor who loves
with the love of her life !
And, “Ruth—Ruth !” I whispered at last in a
voice that was not like my own—
She trembled and clung to me fast with a sigh
that was almost a moan.
While you listen and doubt, and incline to the
devil that plucks at your sleeve —
When the vvhispers of angels have failed —then
Heaven speaks once, I believe.
The lightning leapt out —in a flash only seen by
those ridges and creeks,
And the darkness shut down with a crash that I
thought w 7 ould have riven the peaks.
By the path through the saplings we ran, as the
great drops came pattering down,
To the first of the low-lying ridges that lay
between us and the town ;
Where she suddenly drew me aside with that
beautiful instinct of love
As the clatter of hoofs reached our ears—and a
horseman loomed darkly above.
’Twas the Doctor : he reined up and sat for the
first moment pallid and mute,
Then hejifted his hand to his hat with his old-
fashioned martial salute,
And he said with a glance at the ridge, looming
black with its pine-tops awhirl,
“Take my coat, you are caught in the storm!”
and he whispered, “Bo true to the girl! ”
VI.
He rode on—to a sick bed, maybe some twenty
miles back in the bush,
And ive hurried on through the gloom, and I still
seemed to hear in the “ woosh ”
Of the wind in the saplings and oaks, in
with their top boughs awhirl—•
In the voice of the gathering tempest—the warn-
ing, “Be true to the girl! ”
And I wrapped the coat round her, and held her
so close that I felt her heart thump
When the lightning leapt out, as we crouched in
the lee of the shell of a stump—
And there seemed a strange fear in her eyes and
the color had gone from her cheek—
And she scarcely had uttered a word since the hot
brutal kiss by the creek.
The storm rushed away to the west—to the ridges
drought-stricken and dry—
To the eastward loomed far-away peaks ’neath the
• still starry arch of the sky :
By the light of the full moon that swung from a
curtain of cloud like a lamp,
I saw that my tent had gone down in the storm—
as we passed by the camp.
’Tis a small thing, or chance, such as this, that
decides ’twixt the hero and cur
In one’s heart. I was wet to the skin, and my
comfort was precious to her.
And her aunt was away in the city—the dining-
room fire was alight,
And the uncle was absent—he drank with some
friends at the Royal that night.
He came late, and passed to his bedroom without
glancing at her or at me—
Too straight and precise, be it said, for a man
who was sober to be.
Then the drop of one boot on the floor (there was
no wife to witness his guilt),
And a moment thereafter a snore that proclaimed
that he slept on the quilt.
Was it vanity, love, or revolt? Was it joy-that
came into my life ?
As I sat there with her in my arms, and caressed
her and called'her “ My wife !”
Ah, the coward ! But my heart shall bleed,
though I live on for fifty long years,
For she would not cry out, only plead with eyes
that were brimming with tears.
Not the passion so much brings remorse, but the
thought- of the treacherous part
I’d have played in a future already planned out-
ay ! endorsed in my heart !
When a good woman falls for the sake of a love
that has blinded her eyes,
There is pardon, perhaps, for his lust; but what
heaven could pardon the lies ?
And “What does it matter ?” I said. “You are
mine, Lara yours—and for life.
He is drunk and asleep—he won’t hear, and to-
morrow you shall be my wife ! ”
There’s an hour in the memory of most that we
hate ever after and loathe—
’Twas the daylight that came like a ghost to her
window that.startled us both.
VII.
’Twixt the door of her room and the door of the
office I stood for a space,
When a treacherous board in the floor sent a crack
like a shot through the place !
Then the creak of a step and the click of a lock in
the manager’s room—
I grew cold to the stomach and sick, as I trembled
and shrank in the gloom.
He faced me, revolver in hand —“ Now I know
you, you treacherous whelp !
Stand still, where you are, or I’ll fire!” and he
suddenly shouted for help.
“Help! Burglary!” Yell after yell —such a
voice would have wakened the tomb ;
And I heard her scream once, and she fell like a
log on the floor of her room !
And I thought of her then like a flash—of the foul
fiend of gossip that drags
A soul to perdition—l thought of the treacherous
tongues of the hags ;
She would sacrifice all for my sake—she would
tell the whole township the truth.
I’descape, send the Doctor a message and die—
ere they took me—for Ruth !
Then I rushed him—a struggle—a flash —I was
down with a shot in my arm—
Up again, and a desperate fight—hurried footsteps
and cries of alarm—
A mad struggle, a blow on the head —and the
gossips will fill in the blank
With the tale of the capture of Drew on the night
he broke into the bank.
In the eell at the lock-up all day and all night,
without pause, through my brain
Whirled the scenes of m3 7 life to the last one—and
over and over again
I paced the small cell; till exhaustion brought
sleep—and I woke to the past
Like a man metamorphosed—clear-headed, and
strong in a purpose at last.
She would sacrifice all for my sake—she would tell
the whole township the truth—
In the mood I was in I’d have given my life for a
moment with Ruth ;
But still, as I thought, from without came the
voice of the constable’s wife:
“ They say it’s brain fever, poor girl! and the
doctor despairs of her life.”
“ He has frightened the poor girl to death—such
a pity—so pretty and young,”
So the voice of a gossip chimed in: “And the
wretch ! lie deserves to be hung.
They wei-e always a bad lot, the Drews, and I
knowed he was more rogue than crank,
And he only pretended to court her so’s to know
his way into the bank ! ”
Came the doctor at last with his voice hard and
cold and a face like a stone —
Hands behind, but it mattered not then—’twas a
fight I must fight out alone :
“You have cause to be thankful,” he said, as
though speaking a line from the past—
“ She was conscious an hour ; she is dead, and
she called for you, Drew, till the last!
*f»Ay ! And I knew the truth, but I lied. She
. fought for the truth, but T lied ;
And I said you were well and were coming, and,
listening and waiting, she died.
Gro<sf >rgive you ! I warned you in time. You
%iill suffer while reason endures :
Fo* aie rest, you will know only I have the key
of her story—and yours.”
VIII.
fllP'CiJhous crowd in the court seemed to me but
as ghosts from the past,
As the words of the charge were read out, like a
hymn from the first to the last:
I repeated the words I’d rehearsed—in a voice
that seemed strangely away—
In their place, “I am guilty,” I said; and again,
“I have nothing to say.”
I realised then, and stood straight—would I
shrink from the eyes of the clown—
From the eyes of the sawney who’d boast of
success with a girl of the town ?
But there is human feeling in men which is easy,
or hard, to define :
Every eye, as I glanced round the court, was cast
down, or averted from mine.
Save the doctor’s—it seemed to me then as if he
and I stood there alone—
For a moment he looked in my eyes with a
wonderful smile in his own,
Slowly lifted his hand in salute, turned and walked
from the court-room, and then
From the rear of the crowd came the whisper:
“The Doctor’s been boozing again !”
I could laugh at it then from the depth of the
bitterness still in my heart,
At the ignorant stare of surprise, at the constables’
“ Order in Court ! ”
But I know. Oh, 1 understand now how the poor
tortured heart cries aloud
For a flame from High Heaven to wither the grin
on the face of a crowd.
Then the Judge spoke—spoke harshly—l stood
with my fluttering senses awhirl :
My crime, he said sternly, had cost the young life
of an innocent girl;
I’d brought sorrow and death to a home, I was
worse than a murderer now ;
And the sentence he passed on me there was the
worst that the law would allow. . . .
IX.
Let me rest —I grow weary and faint. Let me
breathe—but what value is breath ?
Ah ! the pain in my heart—as of old ; and I know
what it is—it is death.
It is death—it is rest—it is sleep. ’T is the world
and I drifting apart.
I have been through a sorrow too deep to have
passed without breaking my heart.
There’s a breeze ! And a light without bars !
Let me drink the free air till I drown.
’T is the she-oaks —the Peak—and the stars !: Lo,
a dead angel’s spirit floats down !
This will pass —ay, and all things will pass. Oh,
mv love, have you come back to me?
—I am tired—let me He on the grass at your feet,
with my head on your knee.
“ I was wrong”—the words lull me to sleep, Hke
the words of a lullaby song—
I was wrong, but the iron went deep in my heart
ere I knew I was wrong.
I rebelled, but I suffered in youth, and I suffer too
deeply to live:
You ’ll forgive me, and pray for me, Ruth—for
you loved me—and God will forgive.

Your Health Restored!
Your Nerves Steadied and Made Strong!
"IVTO man should be weak ; no man should suffer the loss of that vital element which renders life worth living. No man should allow
himself to become less a man than Nature intended him ; no man should suffer when there is here at hand a certain cure for his
trouble, a check to his waste of vitality.
Most of the pains, most of the weakness of STOMACH, HEART, BRAIN, and NERVES, from which men suffer are due to an
early loss of Nature’s reserve power through mistakes. You need not suffer for this. You can be restored. The very element which you
have lost you can get back, and you may be as happy as any man that lives.
DR. MCLAUGHLIN’S NEW ELECTRIC BELT
Will cure any case of weakness that ever existed, or we will forfeit £lOOO. We mean what we say. It is the acme of mechanical
construction. There never has been anything like it. Fakers copy our advertising, and imitate the appearance of our Belt, but they
don’t sell, nor can’t make, a Belt to equal ours. It gives a powerful soothing current for hours at a time while you sleep. It is Nature’s
Restorer of vitality and it will cure you. “ Wake up.” Get well, and be happy.

The
Pianola
Will
Aid
You
The Pianola is an instrument which will aid you in playing your piano.
It does the hard, technical work, leaving the player to infuse his own
personality into the music.
The performer does not play the Pianola. With the Pianola’s assistance
he plays the piano, though he may not know one note from another.
By a slight movement of a lever, the nimble little fingers of the instrument
that are pressing the piano keys are made to vary their attack.
A touch on another lever, and they hesitate, stop, and bound forward
again in their marvellous play.
No mechanism is apparent, and the player, forgetting the Pianola, for-
getting the keys and complicated action of the piano, is absorbed in the
wonderful effects he is producing from the instrument before him.

Rings Around the Moon.
He walks that side the moonlit street
That shines like cloudless noon.
Hands clasped behind, slow-moving feet,
And eyes that stare the moon.
Always, so walking on such nights.
He goes with upthrown head ;
He sees, else unseen, utmost lights,
And pale moon-rings, ’tis said.
Ringed round with gold and pearly-grey,
The moon shines white and cold ;
Not one in twenty thousand may
His wonder-sight behold.
A dark enchantress wove a spell
’Fore birth about his mind ;
Where men are blind, he sees too well,
And, where they see, is blind.
Lost gold may redden at his feet,
He sees it not; his eyes
Are fixed on that pearl-ringed and sweety*
White Presence in the skies.
A maid goes by with lifted head,
And eyes that fain would greet,
Her mouth most red, most rosy red,
Most like a fruit to eat.
Her eyes shall lose love’s luring gleams,
Her mouth be paler grown,
Ere he shall quit his Court of Dreams
To touch them with his own.
Yet comes an hour to every man—
And it comes late or soon—
When love-at-hand seems better than
Pearl rings around the moon.

Margaret.
O Margaret, your damask cheek
Had sunset’s rosiest hue ;
Your dove-like eyes, benignly meek,
The pansy’s basking blue.
On your calm forehead, like a crown
Of sunbeams, curls did shine;
And yellow ringlets rippled down
Your slender shoulders fine.
The costliest color-scheme now slips
Aside, failing to win
The velvet crimson of yonr lips,
The pale.pink of your chin;
The violet tint that travelled through
Your temples, and the faint
Perfection that played over you,
When blossoming to a saint.
But only your sweet spirit knows
That glorious state afar,
Where blooms your beauty like a rose
On your soul like a star.
When with the Bridegroom banqueting
In richest bliss serene,
And melodists the sweetest sing
To you their sovereign queen.
When fronting with your laurelled peers
The high-throned cherubim,
And Heaven yearns through all its spheres
For your great choral hymn.
When lifting your clear voice on high
And angels cluster round,
And hush their harping symphony,
So subtly-sweet the sound.
Such holy raptures now are yours
In tifet august array ;
But that mild goodness still endures
Tou wrought when shrined in clay.
bjy Margaret! my Margaret !
Chaste spirit 1 Heavenly dove !
How can my sorrowing soul forget
The blessing of your love ?
No earthly feeling touched your frame—
God’s loveliest vestal, you;
Sin had to borrow Virtue’s name
Ere ever Sin you knew.
N.S.W.

The Turning of the Road.
God pardon me that I am now so glad
And from all sorrow stand awhile apart !
I have once more, as once of old I had,
The blossom of the Morning in my heart.
Yea, as a chalice fair, my heart is filled
With wine of sunshine till it overflows:
That wine the blossom of the morn doth gild
Until it turns into a golden rose.
The city, wrinkled with grey street and lane,
Has less of careworn citizens by one ;
A bird of joy is singing in my brain—
A bird of joy that carols to the sun.
As grimly on the way of Life I strode,
With Care beside me, keeping even pace,
I came into a turning of the road—
And my Beloved met me, face to face.
Then silently I said good-bye to Care ;
For, when I saw her look of sweet surmise,
I knew that I had found out unaware
The secret path that leads to Paradise.
And then I knew that all the years gone by,
And all the dreams and memories of old,
Were, as white dawn is to the morning sky—
A silver preface to a Book of Gold.
I know that many hearts for sorrow sigh;
I know that many tender hearts are sad ;
I kno.w that this Great Happiness will die—
And yet, God pardon me, my heart is glad.

A Six Years’ Martyr
* To Neuralgic Torture.
A PERMANENT CURE EIGHT YEARS AGO.
The Case of Mrs. K. WARREN.
(FOR THE ‘‘NEWTOWN INDEPENDENT.”)
The first and most obvious duty before us
is the adoption of a policy of rigidly shap-
ing our actions according to our judgment.
\\ hat these actions should be would remain
a matter of_doubt were it not for such state-
ments as those from the lips of Mrs. Katie
Warren, of No. 106 Wilson-street, New-
town. Interviewed by our reporter, this
lady remarked :
“ For nearly six years I was a great
sufferer from neuralgia, and although I
visited plenty of chemists’ shops, and'pur-
chased the medicines which the chemists
said were remedies for my complaint, I
could not- get ease from any of them. The
pains in my head were terribly severe, and
to think that I had to bear them all my life
was too dreadful a reflection for any woman
to resign herself to patiently. Better a
thousand times to be out of the world than
endure such torture, I used to think, but
what was I to do when no relief could be
obtained ? ”
“Had you tried many things?’•-queried
the reporter.
“All that I could think of, and the only
return I got was to find myself sinking
lower and lower, for it is an awful drain on
the system not to be able to sleep and take
proper nourishment. I certainly thought I
would never be cured, and became a most
unhappy mortal; but one day a relative put
the idea into my head to try some Clements
Tonic, and when I got some I felt great
relief in a few days. The stiffness and sore-
ness vanished from my jaws, and with the
hungry feeling which Clements Tonic gave
me I started to eat well, and picked up
strength rapidly. I was so astounded at
the disappearance of my afflictions that I
thought it was only just a temporary affair,
and that my neuralgic pains would come
back again, but for all that I took a few
more bottles of Clements Tonic, and I have
not been troubled with my unmerciful com-
plaint during the past eight years.”
“ And Ihe you have been free from
other malad<ts.”
“ Unfortunately, I have not, as I took ill
again twelve months ago last February. I
remember the very day, which was an ex-
ceedingly hot one, and in the evening 1
took a cold bath, and caught a severe chill.
Shortly afterwards I was taken with shivers
and frightful pains in my right side, while
in my back and chest the agonies were in
the extreme, t I could hardly breathe for
the pains, as "when each breath was drawn
an acute cutting sensation ran right through
my chest and gave me terrible suffering.
During the night a more alarming symptom
than ever set in, for I began spitting blood,
and, as if my fate were not already suffi-
ciently cruel, the pains in my chest became
still mor6 violent. A little relief was ob-
tained through applying hot fomentations,
but I am sorry to say that the ease was only
of a temporary nature. All that week I
was confined to my bed, although I was
taking medicines in the hope of being helped
out of my distressful predicament; but I
derived no relief. I could not tolerate
lying in bed any longer, so I got up, being
barely able to drag myself about the house,
I was so weak and thoroughly run down.
This calamity came shortly after a domestic
misfortune which had previously befallen
me, so the lowness of my spirits can be
better imagined than described. Although
I would not stay in bed, I was nevertheless
conscious that my health was drifting away,
as I was kept awake at nights by a nasty
hacking cough, and during the day I was
languid could not eat. Because I
vomited clots of blood I imagined some-
thing was wrong with my lungs, and I grew
quite alarmed, while by my sallow com-
plexion and the emaciated condition of my
body I reallv thought I was going into
consumption' I could not digest even the
lightest food procurable, as everything gave
me an uneasy feeling in the stomach, and
my shoulders had sharp pains between
them. Three weary months went on in
this way, all of which time my eyes were
dim and Bwollen and my limbs ached from
head to foot, the pains across my loins being
so bad that I could scarcely walk for them.
Sickened as I was by a vile taste in the
mouth, there seemed no prospect of ever
enjoying my food again, and as my nervous
system was quite unstrung I was a misery
to myself when left alone, for I was always
imagining some frightful thing was going to
happen, and if I heard a knock or anything
of the sort my nerve 3 trembled excessively.
I do not like going to doctors if I can avoid
it, and I followed my previous practice by
taking advertised medicines ; but when my
condition did not mend I thought seriously
of seeing a medical expert. One lady in
particular was very angry with me for not
calling in a doctor, and she said : ‘lf you
will not do so, why not try some Clements
Tonic. You say it cured you before.’ ‘ But
that was for neuralgia,’ I replied. ‘ Never
mind; it may do you good again,’ my friend
answered. It was not improbable, I thought,
so I got a couple of bottles. The first one
affected me but very little, and it was not
until I had emptied my second bottle of
Clements Tonic that I knew whether to
continue with it or not.”
“ Was there much difference in your con-
dition then ? ”
“ Not a great deal, but enough to make
me think I ought to give Clements Tonic a
further trial, and I am heartily glad I did
so, for shortly afterwards I felt so much
revived that I ventured to hope I was saved.
The three months’ blood-spitting trouble,
which had held me in a state of awful
suspense from the time it started, was now
becoming less frequent, and the appetising
influence of Clements Tonic enabled me to
take some nourishment. The indigestion
symptoms which had made me loathe the
thought of eating had lost a great amount
of their force already under the treatment
of Clements Tonic, and as the pains died
away so coiild I sleep in proportion. I used
to prop myself up with pillows because of
fearing suffocation, but that was not neces-
sary now, as Clements Tonic had entirely
relieved my chest, and in a little while my
cough was better. I used to start up
suddenly from my sleep and feel as if I
were choking, but three or four weeks’ use
of Clements Tonic saw me arising with a
cheerful heart and an invigorated system.
The pains left my body one by one, and my
nervousness was quite overcome by the
toning qualities of Clements Tonic, which
had a regulating and strengthening power
over me w’hich surprised everybody. My
complexion became bright and clear, and
the fears of going into consumption were
dispelled by the robust appearance I again
assumed, for I took my Clements Tonic till
I looked and felt as well as I ever did in
my life. My restoration to an enjoyable
existence should be a lesson to other poor
sufferers, so you may publish these par-
ticulars in any way you consider most
useful.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Kaiif Warren, of 106 Wilson-street, Newtown,
Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, Common-
wealth of Australia, do solemnly and sincerely de-
clare that I have carefully read the annexed docu-
ment, consisting of five folios, and consecutively
numbered from one to five, tmd that it contains and
is a true and faithful account of my illness and cure
by Clemen is Tonic, and also contains my full per-

believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the
provisions of the Oaths Act, 1900.
Subscribed and declared at Newtown, this four-
teenth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and
two, before me,

ITCHING HUMOURS
SPEEDY CURE TREATMENT
FOR EVERY HUMOUR.
Bathe the affected parts with hot water and CUTICURA
SOAP, to cleanse the skin and scalp of crusts and scales, and
soften’the thickened cuticle. Dry, without hard rubbing, and
apply CUTICURA OINTMENT freely to allay itching, irritation,
and inflammation, and soothe and heal, and lastly take CUTI-
CURA RESOLVENT PILLS, to cool and cleanse the eblood.
This pure* sweet, and wholesome treatment affords instant
relief, permits rest and sleep, and points to a speedy, perman-
ent, and economical cure of the most torturing, disfiguring,
itching, burning, and scaly skin, scalp, and blood humours,
eczemas, rashes, and irritations, from Infancy to age, with
loss of hair, when all else fails.
MILLIONS USE CUTICURA SOAP
Assisted by Cuticura Ointment, for preserving, purifying, and beautify-
ing the skin, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the
stopping of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough,
and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, and for all the pur-
poses of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Millions of Women use Cuticura
Soap in the form of baths for annoying irritations, inflammations, and
excoriations, for too free or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes
for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many sanative, antiseptic purposes which
readily suggest themselves to women, especially mothers,

Resolvent, as well as for all other blood purifiers and humour cures. Put up in screw*

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1902.
The Question of Certain Hatters.
When the Australian Parliament legislated
on the subject of immigration, it provided,
among other things, against the importation
of workers under contract to serve Aus-
tralian employers. In this matter it followed
a policy which the United States found it
necessary to adopt 17 years ago, and which
Canada found necessary at a later date. It
didn’t strike out any new policy, as falsely
represented by sundry frantic Freetrade
papers, but followed along well-trodden
paths of precedent. The importation of con-
tract labor-generally happens when “black-
legs ” are wanted to take the places of union-
ists and to break down unionism during a
trade dispute ; or to prepare for a cut
in wages, even when there is no exist-
ing dispute. Very often, as in the
notorious cases of Abdul Wade’s camel-
drivers, the imported workers are engaged
for long terms at wages which look
handsome in their own country, but which,
when set against Australian prices and con-
ditions, prove to mean starvation or there-
abouts, and the Australian gaols are filled
with men under sentence for breach of con-
tract, and the community finds itself acting
as Sambo to the boss’s Legree. The whole
business has proved unsatisfactory in every
decent white man’s land, and the general
principle has been laid down that a labor
contract should only hold good in a country
when it is made in that country, so that
there can be no doubt that the employee had
a fair chance to know the conditions under
which he was to work. But an exception is
made when it is necessary to import men of
special skill, or where a new industry is
being started, and by reason of its newness
skilled workers are not to be obtained locally.
And here also the well-trodden paths of pre-
cedent were trodden by Australian politicans
with especial care. The law was, in general,
cordially approved. The Opposition did
not even divide the House on it. George
Reid said not a word against it. It was
commended by his political parasite and
hanger-on, Sydney Smith. Sydney Tele-
graph was quite friendly, and the Evening
News had no remarks to make in disparage-
ment, and Bruce Smith didn’t complain, so
far as anybody remembers, nor was the sour
and rasping voice of Joe Cook lifted in hos-
tile prophecy. It was accepted, to all
intents and purposes, unanimously. No
politician dependent in any way on the demo-
cratic vote would have dared to openly oppose
the principle laid down in the Bill, any more
than he would have dared to oppose the
principle of the ballot, or of manhood
suffrage.
« • • *
Then six hatters arrived at the Sydney
wharves, under contract made in England. ;
Theirs was not the first case in point. Two
previous batches of contract workmen had
come to hand, but their employers, being
calm, sane, well-balanced men, had applied
for the exemption provided under the Act 4
in the case of artisans who couldn’t be i
obtained locally, and had received it, and, j
consequently, no trouble arose. In the case $
of the six hatters, however, the employer ;
proudly refused (or else neglected) to take <
any notice of the law whatever. The men,
it was disclosed, arrived under contract, and
no exemption having been applied for, nor j
any attempt made to show that they came l
within the scope of the exemption clauses,
they were stopped, .just as they would have
been at New York in like circumstances.
Then the Foreign-trade press proceeded to
work up a deafening clamour. No attempt
was apparently made at first to comply with
the law, for even after the shindy had
raged for two days in the Sydney Free-
trade papers, and columns of denunciation
had appeared about the insolence of the Aus-
tralian Government in actually enforcing the
law as it stood (and as the press had helped
to make it), Premier Barton had to say
that no application for exemption had yet
reached him. In the end, an application
did reach him, and then the Government
was able to seriously consider the legal
aspect of the case—a matter which might
have been dealt with and put right weeks
before the men arrived, if the parties chiefly
concerned had not been too bumptious to
comply with such a small, ordinary, under-
sized thing as the law of the land. When
the necessary evidence was supplied the
men were admitted. Whether the whole
ridiculous defiance of the law had in it any
preconceived intention to work up an agita-
tion against the Australian Government, it is
impossible to say. Certainly the people
who didn’t comply with the law, and who
posed as martyrs when they were not
allowed to break it, made all the noise that
the case admitted of. Also, Freetrade
politicians who had supported the making of
the law, and Freetrade papers which had
approved of it, and gained much kudos
thereby for their liberal and progressive
sentiments, went on unspeakably about
“ freedom ” and “ liberty ” and “the Con-
stitution,” and “our fellow Englishmen”
and so on, when the statute they had
approved was put into force.
• • • *
As a matter of fact, Australia has
been very little accustomed to a Govern-
ment which endeavors to actually and
literally and honestly administer the stat-
utes as they stand. Such things don’t
happen under State control. N.S.W. has
laws against Sunday-trading, which are
never enforced except when Sunday
Brunker has a spasm ; laws against
Sunday liquor which are enforced
now and then ; laws against gaming-shops
which are put into execution about one
day in the year and are a dead letter for
the other 364 ; laws against Sunday labor
which are carried out against a stray China-
man now and then. The regular custom is
to pass the law to gratify one party, and
gradually let it slide to gratify the other,
and start enforcing it again when the first
party makes an extra disturbance, and then
drop it again, and so on ad infinitum.
N.S.W. is so accustomed to this unfinished
way of doing things that when the Australian
Government took its own law seriously—a
law whicli had the almost unanimous support
of the people who are now execrating all
parties concerned bar the six hatters and the
employer who so shockingly muddled things
—and actually assumed that the statute
meant what it said, it was spoken to with great
violence. The Telegraph called its action
a “freak the usual evil-minded insinuation
was thrown out to the effect that the enforce-
ment of the law which was passed with the
cordial concurrence of almost every N.S.W.
paper and politician was a base and foul
Victorian conspiracy ; also the spectre of
“ loyalty ” was roused up, and even the
bones of the sectarian corpse stirred a little
in their grave.
* * • •
In addition to the other troubles, Senator
Pulsford had the amazing front to assure
the six hatters (whose only fair grievance was
against the lamentably-confused employer
who had failed to take the proper legal steps
to secure their admission) that the applica-
tion in their case of an Act which was passed
by an almost unanimous vote of the House
of Representatives was an “affront,” and
was “repudiated and regretted by every
man and woman in Sydney.” But among
the various spectres that hustled round on
this memorable occasion the goblin of
“loyalty’’and “devotion to the Empire”
was probably tbe most aggravated. The
fact that the hatters were “ fellow subjects
of King Edward ” was spoken of at great
length, and in tones of horror which
the case hardly called for, seeing that
an enormous majority of our fellow-
subjects are blacks and yellows, and
that not one of the papers or politicians who
lamented the indignity of keeping our
fellow-subjects out would dare to openly
recommend a general letting of our fellow-
subjects in. Yet no one, in all this chaos,
ventured to propose the repeal of the Act as
a simple way out of the difficulty. The
paper or politician who did that would be
lost, or thereabouts. Also, no one ventured
to openly demand that the Australian Govern-
ment should illegally suspend the Act.
And no paper or politician had the honesty
to say that it or he was an incompetent
fool inasmuch as it or he helped to pass, or
allowed to pass without protest, a measure
which was loaded, without seeing that it was
loaded. The Act is there ; it obviously and
plainly and intentionally shuts out the bulk
fof our “fellowsubjects under King Edward,”
and it was obviously intended so to do ; it is
being enforced to the letter, as all laws
should be ; and what more is wanted 1 Not
one of the great aggregation of blatant agi-
tators who are now yelping after a little brief
popularity has the courage to say that he
helped to pass a drastic law for purposes of
t self-advertisement, but that he didn’t mean
1 it, and expected the thing to be a dead letter,
and took it for granted that the Ministry
would prove as great a sham as himself, and
would wink the other eye whenever trouble
could be saved by winking the other eye.
* m • »
Every law that is passed should be
honestly and completely administered till it
is repealed. It is the only way to give good
laws a fair trial, and to secure the repeal of
bad laws. If the people who bellow about
the wickedness of a system which puts diffi-
culties in the way of the landing of our
“ fellow-subjects ” mean that any person has
an inherent right of entry to Australia
because he is a fellow-subject, then they
will openly demand the free admission of the
Hindu, the Malay, the Hongkong China-
man, and all the rest. If they are not pre-
pared to demand that (and not one of them
has the courage to do it), then the “ fellow-
subject ” argument is a lie and an imposture.
If they propose to say that the action of the
Barton Government, in demanding proof
that the six hatters were fairly admissible,
does not lie within the four corners of the law,
then they should say it; but nobody amongall
the gang of complainants did quite venture
to say it. If it is held that the contract
clause is too rigid, then almost every editor
and politician who has been trying to catch
a few fleeting pennies or votes by weeping
over the woes of the six hatters, should
begin by speaking severely about himself
for helping to create that clause, and then
should seriously explain how it should be
amended. Probably it might fairly be amended
so far as to admit white workers of good
character and education under contract, pro-
vided the contract is made at full trades-
union wages, and the men are not brought
out to fill the places of local workers by
reason of some industrial disputes—but that
is another issue. The point is that the law
received the almost unanimous sanction of
Parliament ; that it is the duty of the Aus-
tralian Government to enforce it, and
that it has done so honestly and fear-
lessly. If there were 60,000 hatters at
its gates instead of six it couldn’t be
expected to do more or to do less. Nothing
that it can do or leave undone is likely to be
good in the eyes of the papers whose free-
postage cadge it suppressed, or the importers
whose Customs swindles it refused to con-
done, or the parochialists whose parochial
axes it refused to grind—but that isn’t its
responsibility.
A Judge of Medieval Mind.
Arthur Griffith’s Quixotic libel action against
Newcastle (N.S.W.) Herald gave at least this
benefit to the community—that it disclosed on the
N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench a Judge of pic-
turesquely medieval mind, whose ideas on the
subjects of free speech and sedition would have
gained him a high place under the Stuarts in
England, and would not, even in the present day,
be inappropriate to the political conditions of
Russia. That the disclosure has not been followed
by such a protest as would act as a remedy, is
due only to the fact—a sorrowful fact, but still a
fact—that the idea of political freedom has prac-
tically no active life inN.S.W. in the present day;
it has slumbered since the days of the old giants
of the struggle for representative government.
The practices of freedom remain, perhaps from
custom, perhaps from Tory indolence, perhaps
from a feeling that any overthrow of the substan-
tial and definite ritual of democracy, the outward
manifestations of the faith, would not be viewed
with the same tolerance as the attacks on its
essence; many men will tolerate an insult to their
God whilst they would fiercely resent a slight to
their sect. But the spirit of freedom—without
which democratic legislation, liberal franchises,
and the rest must one day be lost (as a church
which has become all ceremony and lost all faith)—
slumbers, no matter how loudly Imperialism, mili-
tarism, and judicial arrogance threaten. So deep
is the sleep that there has been not even a stirring
of restlessness at the statements of Justice
Pring from the Supreme Court Bench; though
accepting those statements as facts—and they
were given as the law of the land —there is an end
to political liberty and a return to practical
despotism.
• • • *
The silence of N.S.W. Parliament must be con-
strued either into an acquiescence with, or a
shameful ignorance of the effect of, the Judge’s
view of the law ; for it is the body which has the
authority to rebuke him, and the responsibility to
guard the rights and privileges of free speech.
The principle at issue is not the justification
of Arthur Griffith and his libel-action.
Except for its disclosure of the curious mental
state of Justice Pring, that action can hardly
be said to have served any good purpose. Mr.
Griffith, as a public man of pronounced charac-
ter, not a mere shuffling time-server, but an
independent and vigorous democrat, holding
strong views and expressing them strongly,
must expect a good deal of sharp criticism,
and even of abuse, which, to his mind,
would seem unmerited; must expect to receive
it and must not expect to find a remedy in
a court of law. A contention that the vigorous
denunciations which he gives to principles and
persons he does not believe in are perfectly justi-
fiable, whilst the vigorous denunciations he gets
in turn are quite unjustifiable, suggests a nicety
of distinction so perilously approaching to the
point of being a mere matter of opinion, that no
jury can be expected to take it into account. To
illustrated by a personal argument —if The Bul-
letin in the pursuit of its policy expresses opinions
which other persons condemn as traitorous, vile,
cowardly, unprincipled, its profound conviction
of the injustice of these condemnations would not
lead it to interrupt its mission of trying to be
worth sixpence per copy to appeal for redress to
the law courts. And Arthur Griffith, safe in
the esteem of his constituents and of democratic
Australians generally, should receive without
perturbation Pro-Gore comments, however violent,
upon his views of the late Cohen war.
• * • •
But Arthur Griffith, and the rights and
wrongs of his libel-action, have nothing to do with
the situation created by Justice Pring’s remarks
from the Bench. They raise a new issue alto-
gether, the issue as to whether the Supreme Court
can in Australia to-day revert back to the tradi-
tions of the time in England when Jeffreys and
Wright wore the ermine in awe of a despotic
king ; can nullify not only the freedom won by
custom, strong as statute, during the past three
centuries, but the definite enacted law of Eng-
land. During the progress of the libel-action,
Griffith v. Newcastle Herald (the cause of
action being the publication of abuse of Mr.
Griffith for his “pro-Boer” attitude during
the S’African war), Justice Pring, almost
from the first, allowed to obtrude his strong
sense of agreement with the waging of the late
war against the Boers by the British. His opinion
on that matter he was, of course, entitled to have
and to hold, but not to express before the jury had
come to a verdict; such expression inevitably
prejudiced the jury against the plaintiff, and was
as improper as would be, for instance, the strong
statement of liquor-prohibition views by a teetotal
Judge in a case in which a publican sued for.libel.
Justice Pring even went so far as to inter-
pret to the jury the meaning—as he took it —of a
remark made by Mr. Griffith.
Mr. Griffith : The Conservative party in England is in
the hands of the capitalists.
His Honor : The plain meaning of it is that the British
Government is corrupt.
—Press report.
Further, his Honor constantly interrupted the
speech by counsel (Mr. Blackett) for the plain-
tiff with the expression of his political opinions.
Mr. Blackett : The point was .
His Honor: The point is whether, after the British
Government has declared war, it is not the duty of every
public man, and especially a member of Parliament, to
keep quiet until hostilities are over.
Mr. Blackett : With greatest respect, I submit that it is
not.
His Honor: Ido not believe anyone has a right during
the progress of a war to charge the Government with
being controlled by money-lenders. That seems to me
quite clear.
—Press Report.
And again—
His Honor: But if the Parliaments of these States
began to pass resolutions against the war while it was
proceeding, what sort of effect would that have on the
Continent?
Mr. Blackett : I agree that it would not be right to do
so.
His Honor: It would be a most improper thing to do.
The point is whether it is not our duty as dependencies
of the British Crown to hold our tongues until the war is
over ?
Mr. Blackett : I submit not, your Honor. If Australia
is to be asked to send soldiers to assist the Empire, Aus-
tralian politicians have a right to say how far the war
shall be prosecuted.
His Honor : But you admit that that might seriously
tamper the prosecution of the war ?
—Press Report.
It will be abundantly clear from these extracts
that, throughout, Justice Pring acted not as a
Judge, but as a political partizan, a militant
Imperialist shocked in his every fibre by the
audacity of a man holding in Australia the same
opinions as were held in England by Herbert
Spencer, John Morley, John Buskin, Goldwin
Smith, Froude, Bryce, and many others. The
duty of a public man is egregiously misunder-
stood by Mr. Pring ; were his view to be accepted
as correct it would condemn to the ranks of
traitors some of the most illustrious of English-
men such as Chatham, Fox, Burke, John
Bright, Gladstone, and Morley. It would also
put in the same category ex-radical Joseph
Chamberlain, and would paralyse Parliaments
in the performance of their most responsible and
important duties. But aside from that, aside
from the utter foolishness of Mr. Pring’s politics,
(as to which there is, of course, room for argu-
ment), it is quite certain and open to no argument
that Justice Pring on the Bench should have
no politics, should be neither pro-Gore nor pro-
Boer, should have not the shadow of an opinion
as to any political issues cropping up. It was his
business to interpret the law and to sum up the evi-
dence, not air his views on politics. The latter
he might have done, committing thereby only an
impropriety, after the verdict of the jury; to do
so before was an absolute and insolent dereliction
of his duty as a Judge.
• • • •
But yet further, Justice Pring committed
himself to a statement which was at one and the
same time bad justice and bad law. To quote
again the daily'press report (which, as Justice
Pring did not seek to correct or modify, must be
taken as accurate):
Mr. Want proceeded to deal with the law' on the sub-
ject, but his Honor interposed. He himself would direct
the jury that a public man, especially a member of
Parliament, was liable to be criticised in the very
strongest and roughest terms. On the question of
sedition, he would tell them, to charge the British
Government with corruption, w'as sedition to the highest
degree. Many a man in years gone by had suffered long
terms of imprisonmont, if not lost his head, for less than
this.
Since His Honor had previously interpreted, on
his own account, a statement by Mr. Griffith
into a charge of corruption against the British
Government, he practically sent plaintiff’s case to
the jury with the ruling that plaintiff was “ guilty
of sedition in the highest degree ” —for less than
which in days gone by “men had lost liberty
and ev§n life.” What chance had Mr. Griffith
of having the merits of his case impartially con-
sidered after that ? And apart from the rank
injustice of bringing such a foreign issue into
the matter, ?Judge Pring seriously misrepre-
sented the law. It is true that in “the years
gone by ” venal Judges, at the bidding of the
Court, “established the doctrine that to possess
the people with an ill opinion of the Government
was a libel.” But, as Creasy records, this was
done away with by Fox’s Libel Act, 32 George
111., one of the measures which helped to estab-
lish “the undoubted and invaluable right (to
quote an eminent authority) “of the people to
discuss public matters openly and fearlessly.
But it is not necessary to quote from
law-books and Constitutional treatises to con-


trovert a contention that could only survive
in a prehistoric cast of mind. An intelligent
schoolboy could tell Mr. Justice Pring that a
complaint, even of corruption, against the British
Government is not regarded as sedition in
England, and emphatically not here. If the point
is considered to need argument, there is a N.S.W.
“ case ” wherein the Government of the day was
stigmatised as “corrupt” by a newspaper, and,
feeling the untruth and injustice of the term,
proceeded, not criminally for sedition, but civilly
for libel—each member of the Cabinet issuing a
writ (and afterwards abandoning the proceedings).
• • • •
Noble work for freedom and progress has at
various times been done by English judges,
and Australia has not lacked a Higin-
botham; but, almost necessarily, the judicial
mind is conservative rather than pro-
gressive. Nor will that fact be accounted
a grievance by the most ardent of radicals,
provided that the judiciary is content to be
conservative-and does not attempt to be reaction-
ary. But Judge Pring’s views, if established
as law, would throw back political progress
several centuries, effectually smother freedom of
speech, ancfcattack even the rights of Parliament.
A material'step towards their recognition as war-
ranted is-taken if they are allowed to go without
serious protest. There is still an opportunity
for that protest if Parliament can be awakened
to a sense of f-duty. .
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tom Mann’s Doctrine of Over-
Production.
Up to now, the English labor-leaders who have
visited Australia have been, in the main, disap-
pointing. They have learned their part in Eng-
land, where the conditions are in many respects
the reverse of ours, and they do not seem to
assimilate local circumstances. They talk of the
evils of a hereditary aristocracy to a country
which has none. They complain of the big land-
lord in a country whose real overwhelming octopus
is the foreign bondholder—as England’s debt is
mostly owned in England, they never heard of a
foreign bondholder. They approve of the Old
Age Pension system, bub not one of them warns
the Australian Labor men that this splendid idea
is tottering on a foundation of sand so long as the
Old Age Pensions are really paid out of foreign
loans, which may cease at any moment and leave
the whole scheme on the rocks. England doesn’t
borrow .£60,000,000 or <£100,000,000 a year in
France or Germany to keep its social reforms
(such as they are) afloat, so the foreign loan policy
and its certain consequences appear to be outside
the ken of the English Labor leader who comas
this way. Tom Mann, our latest visitor, seems
to be about the best of a very (poor lot, so far,
yet even he inflicted this unspeakable sample of
old-world dry rot (applicable enough, perhaps, in
Germany or the TT.S. but utterly out of place
here) on a Sydney audience: —
Increase consumption, retrenchment being the greatest
mistake imaginable, causing gluts in the markets of the
wortd, though the wants of many, who could use up the
surplus goods, remained unsatisfied. The biggest trouble
we are undergoing now is brought about, as has been
pointed out by scientists who have thought it out,
because we do not increase our consuming capacity com-
mensurately with our producing capacity.
Australia already imports and consumes goods to
the value of over £42,000,000 a year. To pay for
them, and also to pay the £14,000,000 or so per
annum interest on its public and private foreign
debts, it needs to export goods to the value of
£56,000,000 a year. As it happens, it only ex-
ports £49,000,000 worth, and it'borrows £7,000,000
or so per annum to make the difference good. If
the process goes on the British Cohen will one
day become alarmed and cut off the loans sud-
denly; and when that happens there will be a
panic and a slump; thousands of toilers (now
supported on public works) will be thrown out of
employment; there will be a crash in the public
finances, in which old age pensions will probably
disappear ; wages will be cut down all round, and
the Labor party will be at a discount. It will be
a time of Tory reaction, because the Tory can
make ends meet (by sacking employees, cutting
down wages, and abolishing old age pensions)
where the Democrat can’t. The only way to
avert the disaster is to borrow less and produce
more. Australia wants to produce and export at
least £7,000,000 worth a, year more, so that it can
pay its interest liabilities without further foreign
borrowing, or else it must import £7,000,000
worth less and produce that £7,000,000 worth
of goods locally instead—which is the same
thing in another form. To preach the doctrine of
increased consumption to a country which already
consumes £7,000,000 worth more per annum than
it can pay for out of its own means is just as ab-
surd as trying to sell ice-cream in Spitzbergen at
mid-winter. The theory which may possibly suit
a eountry with an immense income coming in
from foreign investments doesn’t suit one that
has, in proportion to population, the biggest
extraneous debt on earth, and in which the
interest is going out—not coming in. Fancy
preaching to a community that hardly makes a
steel rail for its railways, or a hat, or a yard of
cotton or silk material, or a bit of tweed for its
own clothes, or one of its own ships, or a bottle of
the spirits which it puts into its own stomach to
make it see its own snakes, that it is suffering
from over-production—because steel rails are a
drug in Germany, and spirits are over-produced in
Scotland, and ship-building is overdone on the
Clyde, and the cotton production of Lancashire is
ahead of the demand ! Yet that is what the
imported labor leader does. He wants to drain
our dry country because England is damp, and he
brings out valuable recipes for frost-bite because
England is cold.
»
The Labor Party "goes Federal. ”
The Australian Labor party, at the inter-State
conference just concluded, justified the best hopes
of those who look with confidence to this organ-
isation-sprung from the tillers of the soil, the
miners, the shearers and the laborers, but not
confining itself to them either for its rank and file
or its leaders—to foster the natioual sentiment of
the Commonwealth. Perhaps the most gratifying
resolution come to by the conference was at the
instance of Representative Tupoß :
That all industrial legislation be taken over by the
Federal Parliament.
For'this gives to the Labor party'the stamp of a
"Federal party,” shows it recognises now that
Australian democracy is to be best served by an
extension of the powers of the Federation. That
attitude marks a very material advance. Two
years ago, i,n N.S.W. most clearly, in some of the
other States with less unanimity but none the less
patently, the Labor party was inclined to be an
anti-Federal party. It distrusted the Union pro-
posal as a Tory move, and by the strength of its
influence succeeded, to some extent, in limiting
the scope of the Commonwealth constitution.
Recognition of the mistake then made has been
prompt, and the Labor party, with practical
experience of the working of an Australian
government, voices now the national sentiment in
favor of “more Federation.” Another resolution
of prime importance was carried at the instance
of Senator Higgs :
That provision should be made to prevent foreign
borrowing by the Federal Government, except for the
conversion of State loans. That all future loan bills
should make provision for a sinking-fund.
This constitutes a declaration in favor of financial
reform and economy for which there was a pressing
call. It has been charged against the Labor Party
in some of the States —and not without reason—
that it encourages extravagance and endorses the
policy of reckless borrowing. The Federal Labor
Party, byits votes in Parliament and its resolutions
in conference, purges itself of that scandal. Its
example should be promptly imitated by the State
Labor political organisations. A third resolution
of a national character was in favor of an Aus-
tralian navy to replace the present tribute-to-
England system. Other important matters dealt
with were an affirmation of a “ White-Australia ”
poliey ; and a declaration in favor of the protec-
tion of Australian shipping against foreign com-
petition, and the protection of Australian sailors
and passengers against the dangerous greed of
some Australian ship-owners. But the main
points to be noted are that the Australian Labor
party declares itself as a Federal party, in favor
of the extension of the powers of the Federation ;
as a Financial Reform party, opposed to the
pawning of the Commonwealth to the foreign
money-lender ; and as a National party, opposed
to any system of tribute which puts Australia in
the contemptible position of a parasite on another
nation. Federation, Financial Reform, Nation-
alism —it is a good fighting platform.

Cement.
The malignantly unpatriotic attitude of the Free-
trade press (which, in that respect, represents
most faithfully the Freetrade party) showed it-
self with the mask off in the commercial columns
of Sydney D.T. the other day. Extract (ver-
biage omitted): —
The Government cement contracts offer a striking
illustration of the advantages the State Government gains
in using imported cement, instead of that manufac-
tured in the Commonwealth. During a conversation
Mr. (a cement-importer), pointed out that the
lowest tender for the 50,000 casks required by the
Government (imported) was Bs. 10£d. in bond, but the
lowest tender given for local cement was 10s. The only
rebate which the Government obtains from the locally-
made article is 2d. per bag for returns. In the case of
imported cement, however, the account stands ;
s. d.
Amount of tender ..8 10J
Add duty .. .. M „ ..2 6?
11 4|
Less payment to consolidated revenue
« Wharfage 0 5f
Receiving and delivery .. ..03
Return of duty from Common-
wealth, 75% .. .. .. 1 7|
2
Net cost 8 9f
Thus it will be seen that by using imported cement at
11s. 4|d., duty paid, as against the locally-manufactured
article at 10s., the Government gains an advantage of
over Is. a cask, which, in the present instance, represents
between £6OOO and £7OOO worth of revenue on a single
contract. It is only to be regretted that large and im-
portant works undertaken by private enterprise cannot
obtain the same benefits as those enjoyed by the Public
Works Department.
This (saying nothing of the fact that the figures are
faked and that the “payments to consolidated re-
venue only add up to 2s. 4£d., leaving 9s. Ogd. as net
cost) is the sort of one-eyed argument with which
the Foreign-trade paper always boosts up the case
for the destruction of Australian industries. The
other side of the case is that the price paid for
locally-made cement mostly goes in wages. Pro-
bably as much as 6s. out of the 10s. is thus spent.
Out of that the State gets back Is. or Is. 6d. in
customs and excise duties and other taxes, for the
wage-earner spends a large part of his earnings in
dutiable goods, and whether the buyer or the
seller of the goods pays the duty, the consump-
tion of the goods and the receipt of the
duties by the Treasury go together. That
(calling it only Is.) reduces the 10s. to 9s.
The State receives, probably, 6d. in railway-
freights on materials used in making cement.
That brings the 10s. down to Bs. 6d. It makes a
few coppers in land-tax, income-tax, duties,
&c., paid by the boss cement-maker out of
the profits he extracts out of cement-making.
That reduces the real cost of the local
cement still further say to Bs. 3d. Then
the State saves probably, 2s. in pauper relief—
N.S.W. is covered all over with relief works, at
which men who might be earning an honest living
at making cement, are doing more-or-less useless
work for a pittance paid out of the loans that are
dragging the State down to bankruptcy. By this
time, the actual cost of locally-made cement is
down to 6s. 3d., as against Bs. 9d. for the imported
article, by the Telegraph’s own calculation. And,
in addition, the making of that cement locally
will save a certain number of men from becoming
loafers or paupers, from relapsing, by sheer pres-
sure of misery, into some degree of barbarism ;
will enable them to keep their wives from being
shoeless, enable them to pay for their children’s
education, give them an industry to which
they may train their sons instead of letting
them loaf at street corners, and prevent
quite the whole of the N.S.W. population waiting
on Owe’Sullivan’s front step till he finds it a job
out of borrowed money. These considerations
can’t be put into actual cash, but they also go to
the credit of the locally-made cement. The Tele-
graph says that the See Government shouldn’t
borrow nearly so much as it does, and, conse-
quently, shouldn’t find work for nearly so many
people out of loans. It says that people shouldn’t
get work at cement-making, or dozens of other
things ; the duties should be taken off to encourage
the importation of these things instead of their
local manufacture. It admits that mining is bad
just now, and agriculture in a very low state.
What does the wretched anti-Australian organ
propose that the Australian people shall live on?
They can’t eat the Telegraph.

Balmain and the Labor Party.
N.S.W. Labor party has no cause to be seriously
discourager! by the result of Balmain South bye-
election. The Labor candidate did not succeed ;
but it could hardly have been hoped that he
would ; and he made a brave show, polling more
than 100 Q votes (only 376 less than were scored by
his opponent). That result, against a sitting
member—a “ good local member ” ; in an electo-
rate which has been made the special and
peculiarly-willing victim of the noisome sectarian
movement; by a man who, outside his adoption by
the Labor party, has no claim to be considered in
any sense of the word a public man ; after only a
fortnight’s canvass ; and in face of the malignant
and unscrupulous opposition of the whole Sydney
daily press and of organised Capitalism, is really a
matter for congratulation, for it indicates that with
more time for organisation, the result will be re-
versed at the next general election. Mr. Law is
not suspected, even by his best friends, of any
claims to statesmanship; politically, he is a non-
entity whose sole importance in the past was due
to the fact that he was a member of the Labor
caucus. The Labor party, with ample time to
organise its forces, can take steps to see that the
case for Labor is put more forcibly and more per-
suasively at the next contest in this constituency.
The only hope that Mr. Law can entertain of
remaining in political life is that the Parlia-
mentary Labor Party will, from personal motives,
now let the feud drop and leave him in undis-
turbed possession. But it is unlikely that that
mistake will be made; it would mark the
beginning of the end of politically-organised
Labor in N.S.W. To be successful a political
party must never forget—never forgive.

The Anti-Retrenchment Doctrine.
Tom Mann, the English labor leader, now in
Australia, doesn’t seem to have much in the way
of a new gospel tb preach after all. The an-
nouncement that N.S.W. Railway Department
contemplated discharging a number of temporary
employees, mostly engaged on works that are now
approaching completion, roused him to exhort
the railway men generally to resistance, his simple
theory apparently being that the temporary men
should be kept on in some useless fashion or other,
even if the Department has no real work for them
to do. It cost N.S.W. about £4,000,000 of loans
last year to keep these and other temporary
men employed. It will cost another £4,000,000
this year, and another next year, and so on. Now if
Great Britain were borrowing £120,000,000 a
year in Paris or New York in order to
find work for its people—a great deal of
it work that will never yield any re-
turn—how long does Brother Mann suppose the
process would be likely to last, and what kind
of a orasli would come at the end of it ? And,
meanwhile, N.S.W. is paying to countries outside
the Commonwealth nearly £18,000,000 a year for
goods, most of which these men could be em-
ployed making. The State’s iron deposits lie
idle; its railway material and clothes and blankets
and ironmongery and hats and drapery, and
hundreds of other things, are mostly made
abroad; and in order that the people may
have money to buy those things from the im-
porter, it floats big loans and pays wages
for making ridiculous, useless humps on the shores
of Sydney harbor, such as “Lyne Park.” The
doctrine of State employment is a noble one, and
there are at least £10,000,000 worth of imported
goods that could be made every year for
the use of N.S.W. alone—goods that might be
made in State workshops, if private enterprise is
too slow to undertake the work, or won’t under-
take it on suitable terms. But the policy
which leaves the work of the skilled and scientific
artisan to foreigners, while the Cornstalk becomes
a- beast of burden, a mere animated dredge or
sand-scoop, doing work that, in many cases, he
knows to be useless or almost useless, and which
could be better done in many cases by machinery
at a quarter the cost, and getting for it wages that
in many cases he knows the work isn’t worth, and
which are paid out of money abjectly begged
from Cohen, the money-lender—it is a pitiable
business, and doesn’t tend to make a nation of
real men. The same energy which is employed
in persuading Government to find useless jobs for
the unemployed would, if better directed, start
remunerative undertakings—huge woollen fac-
tories, steel-rail mills, and all manner of other
works, to make things that are really wanted.
But it is easier to make roads to nowhere, and
dig holes, and fill in bits of harbor, and out scrub,
and shovel sand, and generally to drift along the
line of least resistance.

Reid’s “Cruel Joke.”
Dry Dog Reid, orating at Maitland to one of
those moderate audiences which the Foreign-trade
press of Sydney inflates into a huge and madly
enthusiastic multitude, was just the same old
clown, the same old incompetent scoffer, the same
old sitter on a rail, and the same degraded political
time-server as usual. His bitterest wail was that
the Australian Parliament, which accomplished
four times as much important legislation in its one
session as Reid himself ever did in the same time,
hadn’t done a lot more. His second bitterest wail
was that Premier Barton had had the courage to
enforce the law re the importation of contract
labor, which law was passed with the full con-
currence of the great bulk of the Reid party in
the Representatives, and without any protest
from Reid himself. Casually he jeered at the
Barton Ministry on account of the Braddon
clause in the Constitution—the clause which
George Reid himself got reinserted at the Con-
ference of Premiers, the final Conference which
he called for the express purpose of devising some-
thing to take the place of the Braddon clause.
He denounced, in a vague sort of way which
didn’t actually commit him to anything, the
Government’s idea of an all-Australian Concili-
ation and Arbitration law. But the most remark-
able sentence'in the whole evasive and slippery
oration was this (S.M. Herald report) :
A Defence Bill was introduced, it was debated atlength,
and was taken into committee—but then it passed into
darkness and oblivion. (Laughter.) What was the next
great thing—old age pensions. That was a cruel joke
played on the old people of Australia.
The great shuffler didn’t venture to say that the
Barton Ministry promised old age pensions and
then broke its promise, for that would be too
glaring a lie. Nor that it introduced an Old Age
Pension Bill and dropped it, for everybody knows
the Barton Government did nothing of the kind.
He doesn’t say where it could have found the
money for pensions. When he savs Old Age
Pensions were the “next great thing” he just
avoided saying that they were the next great
thing on the Barton Government’s pro-
gramme ; if he had said that he would have
been definitely located as a direct falsifier.
Simply saying they were “ next ” commits him to
nothing, but suggests a good deal. Nor does
he say that he would have furnished old age
pensions for all the Commonwealth if he had
been Premier, or that he will do so when
he l rc, eraier ,i 1,0 was five years Premier
m N.S.W. without enacting an O.A.P. law
even for one State, and so he carried on the cruel
joke three times as long as Barton has done.
Reid simply insinuates in a mean, poisonous way
that in some unspecified fashion the ’Barton
Government played a cruel joke (kind of joke not
explained) on the poor. He doesn’t define him-
fi .. . 8 F einark represents the great art of
backbiting, insinuation, and indefinite slander in
its most non-committal aspect. Politics are none
too clean a game at most times, but they look
never more nasty than when G. Reid takes a hand
at them.

A Tombstone Syndicate.
The Southern municipalities of Melbourne are
comX W f b f lng xploitcd t 0 sotne purpose by a
complicated syndicate-at least they are likely to
be unless somebody or something gets in the way
A while back these councils got from the Govern-*
ment 300 acres of land at Spring Vale for a ceme-
tery. Each of the nine councils appointed a
trustee, the ground was laid out, the Railway
Department built a branch line with accessories,
and everything was prepared for a large and com-
modious germ-factory to start business. Then
the councils—who were naturally supposed to
have made themselves responsible for this outlay—
seemingly fainted from over-exertion and dropped
off to sleep. Anyhow, it now transpires that
instead of the municipalities owning the burying-
ground given them by the Government, to the end
that they might run it as cheaply and decently as
might be, it really belongs to a private syndi-
cate of six ! This remarkable position arises
from the fact that the municipalities declined —
or, at any rate, neglected to give a guaran-
tee to Government to run the necropolis,
and that thereupon six of the municipal delegates
(three having dropped out) themselves privately
took up the guarantee and have been actually con-
stituted a trust. These interesting six contend
that they now own the oemetery and will do there-
with as they think fit. They have given a joint
and several guarantee to the Railway Department
of £520 a year for 20 years. On similar guarantees
they have borrowed £5400 from a bank which they
have spent (entirely “on their own ” and without
consulting the municipalities) in surveys, buildings,
roads,- tools, office-rent, salaries, etc.; and they
have borrowed a further £4OOO from the bank and
have therewith bought (in their own names)
an extra 457 acres alongside the Government’s
30.0, So far as they have done business—and the
railway is not running yet—their revenue has been
£l4O from sale of firewood, £5O for grazing rents,
and £37 for graves; total, £227. Even this is not
so bad for the first year; when the dead go
down there at the rate of a score or more a day, as
they must when the Melbourne cemetery is
presently closed, the profits of these 757 acres of
burying ground are likely to be large. Consider !
Here are 757 acres, costing, ready prepared, some
£lO,OOO or £12,000, most of which will be sold at
from Ito 3 guineas per sq. yard ! In addition,
there are extra fees for Sunday burials, re-opening,
keeping green, putting stones up, re-cutting
stones, etc. It ought to be a very good syndicate,
and it is characteristic of Melbourne that even the
silent tomb should be in the hands of Private
Enterprise.

Melbourne Argus worked itself into a white
fury over the six maddened hatters on the
Orontes, and many strange animals wrote letters
to it or supplied it with interviews to keep its
excitement at full blast. One interview, with
R. S. Walpole, secretary of the Employers’
Federation, was reported thus:
Mr. R. S. Walpole, secretary of the federation, states
that among employers there is a general feeling of indig-
nation at the step. He was not aware that the Immi-
gration Restriction Act contained such an absurd clause,
a provision which no progressive nation would tolerate
for one moment. In America, whatever views they
might hold regarding protection, they had never
attempted to protect themselves against sober and
intelligent artisans, or any human being on two legs. On
the contrary, they acknowledged that every such immi-
grant was worth 500 dollars to the State.
The secretary of the Employers’ Federation evi-
dently possesses a lot more ignorance than he is
aware of. He didn’t know that there was an
anti-contract labor law in his own country. He
evidently does not know that there has been a simi-
lar law in the United States for 16 years—in fact,
that the U.S. practically invented this kind of
law. He never heard of the U.S. having Chinese
Exclusion laws, or laws prohibiting the immigra-
tion of paupers, lunatics, women of bad character,
&c., &c. In short, the awful man seems to have
such a capacity for not knowing things that The
Bulletin would be not in the least surprised to
learn that he did not know about Jonah and the
whale.

“ Hermes ” on a Cold Tea subject:
The Maorilanders are intense, even unto fanaticism.
In no other part o.f Australasia would the effort to bring
about total prohibition have been so sustained in the face
of continual defeat. For nearly 20 years the fanatics
who look upon malted and spirituous drinks as the out-
ward and visible sign of an inward devil, and the root of
all evils, economic, moral and social, have preaehed and
prayed, written pamphlets, compiled statistics (of a sort),
imported alleged great speakers, and raised Gain generally.
For two decades they have importuned Parliament,put up
candidates to split votes, poured out wealth and work like
water, until the constant dropping of the cold tea threatens
to wear away the hardest basalt of circumstance, and there
are more unlikely things than that the Prohibitionists
will shortly succeed in banishing the accursed der-rink
right out of the islands. The Prohibitionist party has
been asked where it is going to get ««. revenue
that has hitherto been collected on liquor through
the Customs and the Excise, and it cheerfully
replies that in any case the country pays the
revenue, and it does not matter whether it pays on
liquor, or in direct taxation, or on clothing or food or
anything else. Yet, to make up the lost revenue, the
Maorilander will have to pay a heavy tax on many neces-
saries of life, as there is no other luxury that can be
taxed in the same degree as aloohol. But of these things
the Prohibitionist takes no heed. Maoriland was at one
time probably the most drunken part of Australasia.
Even now its record is much worse than that of Tasmania
or South Australia. Therefore, if Prohibition is carried
there will at least be a good deal of work for it to do, and
a reasonable number of hard cases to reform. And, in
any case, it will be an interesting experiment for the rest
of the Australias to watch from a distance.
Extract from a letter to the Argus from D. J.
Ham, a Victorian residing in Johannesburg:—
Johannesburg at present contains a larger proportion
of unemployed than any country in the world, and the
cost of living is dearer than any place in the world.
Rents are still being raised, and the scarcity of accommo-
dation here is a grave matter indeed. This pressure and
congestion is rapidly increasing, and as fast as it increases
so in proportion does the landlord increase his rent and
the boarding-house and restaurant-keeper their tariffs.
Johannesburg will be landed in a grave dilemma before
long. . . . The native labor supply for the mines and
other pursuits is one of the important questions of the
future. As a comparison, I may point out that the
number of natives at work at the end of September, 1899
was close on 100,000 ; to-day it is less than 50,000. This
is a black strike.
This seems to have opened one of the Argus
eyes to the danger of the black labor move in
Australia. In a leader on Ham’s letter the once
sturdy advocate of the .Kanaka writes :
There are more unemployed in Johannesburg than
any place in the world, but those unemployed are white
men, Australians and others, and the companies do not
want them. Fifty years ago there was a rush from Natal
and from the Cape to Australia, but that was because a
man could march to the diggings and could work for him-
self, and a stroke of the pick might any moment bring
him fortune. His chances did not depend upon his being
taken on for wages by a cosmopolitan company with a
preference for black tabor and a weakness for coolies or
Chinamen as substitutes for the black. If that had been
the Australian condition there would have been no rush
here of the adventurers who made this land-whose
courage and resource this generation is disposed to envy
To return to the point, it may be alleged that whatever
prospect Johannesburg opens up it does not seem to be
one for the Australian worker.
Apparently the Argus begins to realise that the
Australian white laborer is a better tax payer
than Kanakas, coolies or Chinamen and does not
want to lose him.

George Musgrove revives the “Chinese
H'oneyriioon ” at Sydney Royal on Saturday. It
is to snow itself for four evenings only. Just at
present Sydney feels lilie a cheap and inferior
Turkish bifth—a clammy, sticky, dead Turkish
bath that died of something unhealthy. It is
quite impossible, till a southerly change comes,
to say the things about.-the “ Ho.neymoofi ” that it
deserves, so this paper just faints two or \three
times in a casual way and lets the matter pass.
The “Thirty Thieves ” are to bestaged on Boxing
Night. Goodness only knows why the .usually
lavish Musgrove'restricts them to thirty when the
raw material is so^plentiful.' There are fully 200
house-agents in Sydney alone, to say nothing of
plumbers.

Melba’s Sydney season of grand opera
closed at the Royal on Saturday night with
two acts of “Traviata” and third and last acts of
“ Faust?” A most triumphant close it was, proud
as a, conqueror’s, hymn, and filled with applause
and'flowers and the enthusiasm of the public and
critics. As Vi'oletta, “ the misguided one ” in
“ La Traviata,” Melba’s brilliant 20-year-old voice
expressed to the utmost the womanly tenderness
ancf delicacy of the character. And in the part of
Marguerite, wearing a fair wig with circleted fore-
head, Melba looked the character and acted with
charm and pathos. Sydney was grateful for the
new business she introduced into the part of the
sweet maiden who spins and goes to mass, and
loves a man and his diamonds, dies, and is
canonised. Madame Slapoffski was as good in
her rdles of Siebel amd Martha as-her husband was
with his orchestra. It is possible that Melba»will
appear again in Sydney prior to leaving for her
American engagement. But she has an Austra-
lasian and M.L. tour to accomplish first.

Sydney Palace, which has done nothing
very remarkable since that tempestuous night
when Henry Lee rose to his full height (which
isn’t so very much) on the stage, and spoke frankly
to Sydney about its alleged-bear-like manners and
its alleged British ancestors, re-opens- with William-
son’s Opera Co. on Boxing Night. There is
to be an eight weeks’ season, commencing with
“Dorothy.” Whether the beautiful “Rose of
Persia” will be induded isn’t known at time of
writing, but considering how coldly Sydney
looked on that deserving blossom from the land
of Artaxerxes, it probably won’t.

“The White Heather” plays to good houses
at Sydney Lyceum, where the appearance of Lady
Molly Fanshawe as' Lady Godiva, in the sacred
cause of charity, will continue to give the audi-
ence a favorable opinion of London society
till further arrangements are made. The
various scenes where the nobility of England
leave the impression of ' being a race of cheerfu-l
idiots are as amusing as heretofore. In the old-
fashioned drama it was mostly the rustic who was
the light-hearted imbecile, and the Lord of the
Manor who strode about with care on his brow.
But in the society drama, the only really lofty
person is the footman.

At Sydney Criterion, Johnny Sheridan
continues to trip to Chicago in the shoes which
(the widow alleges) last him longer than they
would any other lady. In regard to shoe-leather,
Johnny would have made an economical wife,
having once enacted a flighty damsel every even-
ing in a pair of slippers that lasted Him two years.
But, on the other hand, Johnny is an expensive
lady in respect to skirt-frills, so that he cannot be
held up as a model by husbands with long dress-
bills to pay. “A Trip to Chicago,” with its
“ Romeo and Juliet ” duet and other attractions,
will hold the boards till it is time to get .the pan-
tomime under way. Said panto, not being
“Gulliver,” is naturally “Cinderella.” Almost
every panto, that isn’t “Gulliver” is “Cin-
derella.”

Dolores’ complimentary concert to Mr.
Sykes came off at Sydney Town Hall last Satur-
day, with State Governor and suite present for
half the programme. The hall was comfortably
crowded, and to show its love the crowd gave the
soprano plenty of extra work. Her renderings of
“I attempt from Love’s sickness to fly,” “ O,
listen to the voice of Love” and “I’ve been
dreaming,” were all warmly encored. As encore
to the “ Echo Song ” Dolores gave the ‘ ‘ Laughing
Song,” but failed, so oppressive was the night, to
rouse the audience to hold its sides. Clarence
Newell and Henri Staell were in their usual good
form, and there was great abundance of flowers.
Dolores has been heard in the last
time forysome years’ at Jeast, and is now winding
up her Australasian tour.

Sydney Tivoli programme is just now
overloaded with singing turns. There were a
dozen or so ballads listed for last Monday night.
George Towns, champion sculler of the world,
gives an “exhibition of rowing” on a patent
rowing-machine, which is interesting because jif
the personality of the performer ; but a very much
bettter “turn” could be 1 made. of it with a
little mechanical ingenuity, moving scenery and
so on. Spry and Austin, comedians, have some
skill for humorous dancing and a great deal of
“ business ” which is not at all humorous ; when
a comedy man soaks himself from a soda-water
syphom the ‘Moke” is about as sodden as his
clothes. Miss Malveena Moore appeared for the
first time last week, and proved to be a clever
dancer.

The revival of “Paul Jones,” at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.), brings the present season to
a roaring conclusion. Planquette’s musicianly
work seems an up-to-date relic' of\the golden age
of French comic opera. Nothing so strong and
estimable comes new into the market nowadays.
It has a distinct plot, with an interesting she-
male hero, a string of catchy melodies, much
humor and bustle, and a moral to be remembered.
The apostolic Jones escapes arrest, and probable
death, at the hands of a bounding lunatic poten-
tate through a trifling incident in his gory career.
He mentions that he had been responsible for the
decease of a previous husband of the lunatic’s
elderly ward, whereupon that stout and grateful
lady blesses him with all the enthusiasm of a Mrs.
Sangal, instead of denouncing him to the local
authorities as the pirate they are looking for.
• • * •
Nobody can honestly take oath that the
present cast of. “ Paul Jones ” equals the original
Australian cast in all-round effect, but everybody
admits it to be more than passable. In one respect
this is an improvement on previous productions.
Bathurst, as Bicoquet, has a better voice and a
more striking- appearance than his predecessors.
For the rest, Florence Young looks, acts and sings
the name-part like the valuable, conscientious
artist she is. The music doesn’t suit her voice,
but - she sings down to it, and plays with
animation at points where Madame Burton of
yore merefy posed. George Lauri and Lawrence
Hanray are satisfactory mariners bold, for al-
though Hanray is a taller “Insect” than his
mate, he has a skeleton arm and an attenuated
leg, which account for his subservient attitud’e.
Hugh Ward, always a finished comedian, is an
active and frivolous Don Trocadero in liis charac-
teristic, careworn way. The Rufino of Reg.
Roberts suffers from.insignificance. Maud Cliet-
wynd, as Ghopinette, pert rather than saucy,
takes the Sabots song and dance too quickly, and
Carrie Moore is Carrie Moore, beribboned and
over-accentuated, her high-pressure warbling being
more screamful than usual. The ballet andchorus
are great, whereas Miss Ghiloni is peculiarly ill-
dressed and the orchestra is too loud. “Paul
Jones ” terminates a brilliant financial career on
Saturday, after which the theatre will be closed
for panto, rehearsals.

“A Royal Rival,” which repeats the
ancientstory of " Maritana ” in the form of a play,
has fallen on dull times at Melbourne Princess’.
“Maritana,” bereft of “Yes, let me,” and kin-
dred bulwarks of the barrel-organ, seems forlorn,
like Darby at Joan’s funeral, or strawberries sans
cream. When Gerald Du Maurier started his
“stirring romantic drama” in life, with an old
plot and an atmosphere of haunting musical
memories, he made the mistake of putting new
wine into old bottles. Yet his play is not dull,
which speaks well for the old bottles—also for
some of the acting. Harcourt Beatty, though
he labors heavily at times in his effort to
seem devil-may-care, does really good work as Don
Caesar De Bazan, the rowdy Spanish grandee.
Here, as in the opera, Caesar is committed to
matrimony with an unknown, veiled lady, brought
to the condemned cell by Don Jose, who arranges
the match for purposes of his own—the same old
purposes that Australia knows so well. Seeing
that operatic amateurs, as a class, yearn to produce
“Maritana,” the aspiring Caesars might do worse
than take a wrinkle from Beatty’s acting methods.
Non-professionals in the drinking-scene generally
aim at seeming very drunk. Beatty is more
dashing but less unsober than most of them.
Minnie Sadler’s “gipsy” is a tense, tragic sybil
with'a preachy note in her voice. Not the gitana
to do good business —lilting, singing and telling
fortunes in the streets; though she might make
money casting horoscopes in an impressively
darkened room. Albert Gran as the “Royal
Rival,” i.e., the King of Spain, is not an antago-
nist likely to oust any nice young man from the
affections of his best girl, unless she were the sort
of person who enjoys sitting among the tombs, so
to speak. There’s so much of His Highness’ pale-
dumpling expanse of face, and something so un-
canny in the mysterious way he “approaches”
any object—be it his lady-love, or a drop of drink
standing invitingly on a table. He never arrives
anywhere without about six stealthy, melo-
dramatic advances, retreats, and circular prome-
nades round the desired locality. Sydney Stirling
is a shapely Don Jose, and the rest of the co.
includes Miss Athena Claudius, as an admirable
boy Pedro (the Lazarillo of the opera), who re-
moves the bullets from the arquebuses of the firing
party what time condemned Caesar is obliging
them with a song. This is the most dramatic
Beene in a well-dressed and brightly-mounted
show.

Business was good last week at the Opera
House, where Cinquevalli’s season of piquant
jugglery was to end on Saturday (13th). Toorak
affects the Opera House, these times, not solely
out of compliment to Cinquevalli, though, of
course, it’s a safe thing to admire an artist hall-
marked by the approval of Royalty. But, inde-
pendently of the juggler’s reputation, the hearts
of theatre-goers turn fondly to any comfortable,
go-as-you-please show after the storm and stress
of the Melba season with its box-office vigils and
yawnful bivouacs on guinea perches. Recent
additions to Rickards’ show are Miss Welby-
Cooke, a birdlike, tight-wire walker, and Mr. Les.
Warton, “coon impersonator.” How much
longer will this “coon” vogue last? What are
“ coons ” that imitations of their guttural voices
and loose-jointed antics should still find a market ?
“The Harbeeks,” double-bounders and hoop-
rollers, were billed to appear with Rickards on
Monday of this week (15th).

Fitzgeralds’ Circus, still going strong,
expects even better times now that school-holidays
have begun. A “ special scfiool-day” is announced,
and it will be interesting to note how the cosmo-
politan animal performers comport themselves in
the presence of Young Australia. Said four-footed
foreigners were by no means hospitable on
“A.N.A. Night.” at the Circus, a week or two
back. On that occasion, the British Lion tried to
chew the Strong Man (made in Germany), while
elephant Liz, plunging into the tank in the course
of the stag-hunt, refused to come out again, and
remained “dabbling her tootsies in the Yan Yean
foam ” till bedtime. When her keeper threatened,
“ The next time you washjem, you’ll wash ’em at
home,” the rebel snorted and said (practically) she
didn’t care. Liz, whether an African or a native
of India, has no. causqto be polite to Australia, in
view _of Australian interference in S’African war
and Hindu immigration restriction.
At the Royal, on Saturday night, when
the Anderson co. revived “The Worlds
Verdict,” the audience was large and enthusi-
astic, proving that in the home of melo-
drama nothing succeeds like sensationalism.
“The Verdict" is nothing if not sensa-
tional, dealing as it does with a maniao
inventor, who binds victims under the slowly-
descending knife of his neck-chopping machine.
After seeing the play, one endorses heartily the
advice given in that popular recitation which
begins, “Girls, never marry an inventor. A
melodrama, minus an old gentleman done to death
in the first act by the adventuress and her male
companion, would be like home without a mother.
“The Verdict” has a poisoned “ squire ’ m the
elderly-victim niche —a nice change from the shot
baronet and the stabbed banker of recent Anderson
productions. On first night gallery urchins raised
shouts of “You cow !” whenever villain Willard
strolled in after an evening of murder, etc.,
rubbing his lily hands and inflating Ins snowy
vest. As usual, Inman is the wronged hero.
Miss Hardinge Maltby as his wife, keeps her head
up and her shoulders square, despite missing wills
and consequent woes. Bert Bailey and Ethel
Buckley supply comic relief. Maud G-wynne is
the adventuress, while Ada Guildford does the
victim, whose marriage-lines cause most of the
villainy. Wrongfully jailed, shut up in a mad-
house, garotted in a stone quarry and all but
guillotined by a maniac, that’s all the good she
gets from her certificate of missushood.
** * *
At Melb. Bijou, little Syd. Halliday, as
Lord Fauntleroy, is living down the vague un-
popularity (born of satiety), which has gradually
attached itself to the memory of the eurled,
sashed lordling, whose fads and fashions were
vulgarised to death long ago. Present exponent
of the part turns over a new leaf, and, as it were,
makes a fresh start. Those responsible for his
stage training have wisely not been slaves to
“Fauntleroy” precedent. Their pupil affects
short hair and boyish pants, and succeeds, not
because of, but in spite of, his sash and fondness for
the term “dearest.” The direct, unfrilled de-
meanor of a real boy proves congenial to the
simple pathos underlying some of Mrs. Burnett s
quiet, domestic situations. The scenes between
cheery little Cedric and his cynical, embittered
grand-dad are natural and touching. The
youngster neither coaxes nor . caresses, and
expresses his childish confidence in his kinsman
only by his chummy way of standing close to the
old man’s elbow, and frank man-to-man habit of
looking him straight in the face. In praising the
Halliday child, it must be remembered that the
boy is highly favored in his support. Hawtrey
understand the art of being a stage grandfather,
and invests his rdle with so much grim, gray grace
that she-beholders are inclined to regret the
impressive ancient’s exclusive devotion to a mere
grandchild.

The two Adelaide theatres have had the
curious idea of both playing “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin ”at the same time. Maggie Moore, at the
Royal, worked hard as Topsy, and doubled the
part of Aunt' Chloe for amusement; Howard
Vernon, at the Tivoli, disguised himself as Uncle.
A semi-interested public would have liked to see
the two co.’s amalgamate for the occasion.
Popular feeling has been very sympathetic to-
wards Vernon, but not to the point of supporting
his show, which finally played “East Lynne’’and
faded away. Maggie Moore has fallen back on
old friends in “Killarney” and “Struck Oil.
Meanwhile, Dolores has twice filled the Town
Hall to overflowing.
Mr. Law, M.P., playing the game of his
new party in the N.S.W. Assembly, raised a
question the other day about the Attorney-
General stopping a prosecution for “gambling
against a R.C. bazaar-promoter at Wyalong. In
that town a miserable, meanly-conducted sectarian
fight has long been in full blast, and the voice of
common-sense can’t be heard for the howling of
green and yellow dogs. Mr. Wise’s action was a
hint to the religious fanatics not to use the
Department of Justice as their cock-pit; a con-
current act on his part, which Mr. Law did not
mention, was the squashing of a verdict against a
Presbyterian bazaar-promoter for gambling. The
Protestant Defence Association hasn’t fathered
a single statement yet which, on investigation,
didn’t prove a straight-out lie or a half-truth
serving the purpose of a lie.
The Law seems to exist mostly for the
purpose of reversing its own decisions. A sea
captain is supposed to be infallible, and when he
loses his vessel after running for 20 years without
making a mistake (and loses her, perhaps, in
circumstances where he had only two minutes to
decide what to do), he probably forfeits his
certificate. The driver of the locomotive which
goes to wreck has his conduct rigidly inquired
into when he comes out of hospital. But a Judge,
who makes bad mistakes in calm weather, when
the court hasn’t sprung a leak, and there is no
fog, and no breakers ahead, and the engine hasn’t
broken down, and his Honor (who hasn’t been up
on the bridge sleepless for 60 hours) hasn’t to rush
for the boats, and he can take three weeks to
think over his decision —well, his Honor is
privileged. For instance, the law says,
apparently, that a divorced person can lawfully
re-marry, when 14 days have elapsed after the
pronouncement of the decree. A person who, 26
years ago, married a divorced woman three days
after the decree was pronounced, recently asked
the N.S.W. courts that the marriage should be
declared void. It was, doubtless, very hard on
the woman, but the law seems clear enough, and
Judge G. B. Simpson held that the marriage was
void. Now the Full Court of three Judges has
unanimously decided that it wasn’t void. .Putting
that case against the case of the Elingamite this
is the question: If it takes four Judges to
successfully steer a small decree nisi in calm
weather (and even then it doesn t seem certain
whether they steered it on the rocks or not, for
the Privy Council may yet have to consider the
same point), what can be reasonably expected of
one captain steering a big ship in a thick fog ?
And if Judge Simpson were to be accused of
neglect to take soundings, or of reckless navigation
of his court in broad daylight, what would
happen ?

Re some remarks in this oolumn (6/12/ 02) about
the many foreign agencies of the North Queensland
Insurance Co. and the danger of doing a widespread fire
and marine business, it is explained that the foreign
agencies are mostly for the more convenient settlement of
marine claims, and that the co. doesn’t straggle all over
the world looking for new business. Under these circum-
stances any aspersion contained in the remarks is unre-
servedly and enthusiastically withdrawn.

Some State revenue returns for November, 1902:
Revenue Increase as compared
November, with November,
1902. 1901.
Queensland « £478,020 .. £236,056
Decrease
Westralia ... 264,056 .. 2,901
Tasmania .. 70,181 .. 8,992
N.S. Wales .. 939,305 .. 102,982
- Victoria.. .. 497,587 .. 120,762
Queensland’s sudden boom arises from the fact that the
pastoral rents, which are usually collected in September,
were this year made payable in November instead. But
for this fact all the States would have shown a decreased
revenue for November, and in every case, except that of
N.S.W., the reduction of the customs revenue (mainly
arising through the abolition of inter-State duties) is the
cause of the trouble. In Tasmania the customs and
excise yield £10,340 less than in November, 1901, so there
is an increase of £1348 in other lines. In Victoria
£86,628 of the falling away is in the customs and
excise item. In N.S.W. land and railway revenue
are notable causes of the decline. If the Australian
Government had been so mad as to throw away more
revenue by abolishing the food duties it is difficult to say
what might not have happened.
• * • •
The following are the financial results so far as
things have gone. In the case of Westralia the figures
are only given up to the end of October. The telegraphed
report states that the November revenue shows a decrease
of £2901, but the telegraphed report so seldom agrees
with the monthly statistical return (which is only avail-
able up to October) that it is best to follow the latter.
South Australia’s quarterly returns are up to September
only;—
Increase

with corre-
sponding
Revenue, period
of 1901.
N.S.W. (5 months to 30/11/’O2) .. £4,370,430 £210,715
W.A. (4 months to 31/10/’O2) .. .. 1,301,674
S:A. (3 months to 30/9/’O2) .. .. 612,784 16,939
Tasmania (11 months to 30/11/’O2) .. 677,063 54,136
Queensland (6 months to 30/11/’O2) .. 1,487,799 55,181
Victoria (5 months to 30/11/’O2) .. 2,718,264 165,973
These are by no means cheerful figures, especially when
it is remembered that the two States which show an im-
provement owe the prosperous condition of their revenue
chiefly to the existence of a boom which is based wholly
on the lavish spending of loan money.
The four States which publish expenditure
accounts exhibit these results up to the latest dates at
which the various accounts are available :
Revenue. Expenditure. Surplus.
Queensland (to
80th Nov.) .. £1,487,799 £928,509 £559,290
Westralia (to
31st Oct.) .. 1,301,674 1,157,362 144,312
Deficit.
S. Australia (to
30th. Sept. .. 612,784 696,798 84,014
N.S.W. (to 30th
Nov.) .. 4,370,430 4,759,313 388,883
If the above situation is compared with that
which existed in each State at the corresponding period
of last year the results show up as follows :
1901 1902
Surplus. Surplus. Improvement.
Queensland .. £481,330 .. £559,290 .. £77,960
Westralia .. 81,884 .. 144,312 .. 62,428
Deficit. Deficit.
NS.W. .. .. 425,032 .. 388,883 .. 36,149
S.A 115,915 .. 84,014 .. 31,901
Every State which supplies monthly or quarterly expen-
diture returns was thus, at the date of last available
figures, in a better position than the one it occupied 12
months ago. In Queensland and S.A. increased economy
is responsible for this, Supposing the remainder of the
year shows a corresponding improvement Westralia will
close the year with a larger surplus than that of last
year ; N.S.W. will have a surplus instead of a deficit; and
Queensland and S.A. will each have a deficit about half
the size of last year’s.
The loan expenditure is known as regards two
States only. Of these Queensland shows up moderately
well, while N.S.W. does the other thing :
Loan Expenditure.

Increase.
N.S. Wales .. 1,616,949 1,956,762 439,813
Considering, how Victoria has been struck by
the loss of its inter-State customs, to say nothing of the
fact that a fall in the railway revenue has now commenced
in addition to its other troubles, and considering that the
stupendous free railway pass system which Tommy Bent
is inaugurating is not likely to improve things, and that
the Irvine-Shiels-Bent Ministry persistently refuses to
levy a general land-tax to make good the deficit, it looks
as if there ought to be a record deficit in Melbourne next
June. On present showing Victoria, steered by the
financially ineapable Shiels, is likely to exhibit the worst
results in Australasia at the close of this financial year.
Turner, in 1897, managed to have a surplus with a smaller
revenue than Shiels is collecting—but then Shiels isn t
Turner.

The -/Jenkins Isoariot Ministry has arranged for
the construction, by alleged private enterprise, of a dry
dock at Adelaide. When the profits fall below 3 per
cent, the Government is to pay the difference; when
thev rise above it, the co. is to get the profits. If it were
State-owned, the Government would get the profits as
well as the losses. Good old private enterprise !

The N.S.W. Government is pushing through a

31 per cent. Treasury bills in Sydney, and realised
j|>9 12s. 6d. per £lOO. And, at the same time, it sold
£500,000 worth of 4 per cent. Treasury bills inßendon at

The profits represent £7 Bs. 7d. per cent, per annum on
the shareholders’funds as at the ■commencement of the
year. The reserves consist of reserve fund, £76,904;
capital reserve acoount (being amounts realised by repur-
chase of depreciated deposit receipts, less amounts
written off), £59,785; a sum of apart for the
further repurchase of deposits; and £13,186 undivided

A considerable amount of progress is being
made at the redemption of the reconstructed deposits.
The amount'outstanding at various dates has been as
follows:

In seven years, £1,026,288 of the old liability has thus
been cleared off. In other respects, also, the E. S. and
A. Bank looks very promising. The new deposits and
advances are both increasing, and the reserve of cash and
State securities (£960,080) is equivalent to nearly 38 per
cent, on all current liabilities to the-public (reconstructed
deposits not included), or 18 per cent, on all liabilities.

On present appearances, the N.S.W. debt next
June, when the financial year closes, will be about
£83,000,000, and the interest will be well over £3,000,000
a year. The debt should reach a hundred millions by
about 1907 or 1908. Then Sydney will have another cen-
tenary and an illumination, and will doubtless bring out
a new postage,stamp with “ One Hundred Millions” and
a Hebrew on it—the last centennial stamp had “One
Hundred Years” and an emu.

It is estimated, in a general sort of way, that
the five mainland States are just now arranging to
borrow among them £6,950,000. Particulars are : N.S.W.
£4,000,000; Victoria, £1,100,000; Westralia, £750,000;
Queensland, £600,000; South Australia, £500,000 (in
addition to £239,000 just borrowed). S.A. and Victoria
are borrowing at 3£ per cent, but N.S.W. seems to be past
that and well into the 4 per cent, stage.

This doesn't suggest any violent or aggressive hustling
after new business, but they don’t hustle very fiercely
after anything in Tasmania, and they seem to progress
reasonably well without it. Also a fire office, with a pay-
able business and a good character of 64 years’ standing,
is almost certain to find the steady-going ways the best.
The income from investments is now £3908, equal in
itself to a dividend of per cent.

The Universal Permanent Building and
Investment Scotty (Melbourne) shows a very greatly
improved position this year, though circumstances pre-
vent the improvement being iminediatdly beneficial to
shareholders. Under the society’s original rearrange-
ment it' paid 2£ .per cent, on all its debentures. Later
they were divided into two equal parts, the “ A ” deben-
tures to receive 5 per cent. interest and the “B" deben-
tures not over 4 per cent., hut less if the earnings d.o not
run to 4 percent. Hitherto, the “B” debenture-holders
seem to have received no interest at all; this year they
get the full 4 per cent., which swallows up no less than
£1146. Also, this year, for tjie first tune, the large
debit balance arising from losses on realisation of pro-
perty shows a.decrease. The situation, lumping together
business losses,and’losses on property, and showing de-
benture.interestuseparately, is as follows :

The accumulated loss on realisation of properties is
£22,199, against which there -is an insurance-reserve of
£3ll and £66 undivided profit, making the net deficit
£21,822, as .shown above. Paid-up capital is £128,648
so there is £106,826 nominally intact. But a large
amount of the assets are still only “ book values,” and it
is proposed to write these down to real values during this
year. Possibly a considerable amount of capital will
remain even after that process is completed.
A certain portion of the profit—it doesn’t
appear very clearly h°W njueifc—apparently arises out of
the repurchase of “B " debentures, at a discount. Now
that the society is able to pay the full 4 per eent. interest
ob its “ B” debentures they will probably not be obtain-
able so cheaply, which is one slight drawback. A good
feature, however, is the reduction in liabilities, the
amount owing to all creditors being as follows:
1894 .. £172,662 1897 .. £119,645 1900
1895 .. 156,907 1898 .. 110,108. 1901 .. 86,906
1896 .. 143,843 1899 .. 106,223 1902 .. /9.501
Very good progress is being made in clearing off
liabilities, and, taking everything into account, the out-
look is promising.

TheN.S.W. Civil Service Superannuation Fund
is now nearly exhausted, and when it gives out pensions
must be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue. But, by
way of taking time by the forelock, the See Government
has a Bill before Parliament by which the remains of the
fund and the civil servants’ contributions will be put into
revenue, and the Treasury will start paying pensions im-
mediately. The fund (about £100,000), with contributions
coming in, would pay the pensions probably till about
next September, but the balance that is not used up by
next June will help to make a surplus for the Govern-
ment. Nothing is too small to be seized in these
times. Probably the next thing to be annexed will be the
Assurance Fund under the Real Property Act (about
£200,000). S.A. annexed its Real Property Assurance
Fund long ago.

The reserves consist of reserve fund, £130,000 and, un-
divided profit, £51,881. The reserve fund hasn’t moved
for the last 11 years, and it certainly looks as if it would
be advisable to transfer to it at least a part of the large
floating balance. The co. owes £2,503,660 on debentures
made up as follows:

A few years ago the co. could have got all this money at
31 per cent, or even less, and thereby saved £14,000 a year
interest, if these early debentures hadn’t been made irre-
deemable.

The usually well-handled B.H. Water Co. lately
committed what may turn out to be an expensive stroke
of foolishness. After the rains had skilfully dodged the co’s
catchment area, dropping in only a few million gallons
of no consequence, the statement was published in the
cities that “ over two months’ supply ” had been added.
The exaggeration was too obviously inspired with the
idea of killing the proposal to provide a supplementary
supply which was just at that moment under Cabinet
consideration. Broken Hill is a very tired place as a rule,
but the liquid abomination which it has had to drink
lately has given it the one fixed idea of getting a better
water supply ; and this apparent attempt to defeat its
idea-made it mad. The co. had a lot of friends in B.H.
before, but those who haven’t died lately have been con-
verted now, and the result will quite likely be that the
co. will lose its monopoly.
* * * *
B.H. Prop, directors got two-thirds of the way
to the mine for their half-yearly inspection ; then turned
tail and hurried back to Melb. Possibly they wanted to
avoid being afterwards asked awkward questions as to
the collapse of the open-cut, which occurred while they
were travelling. Certainly, it is announced that the
crush has left the mine as good as new ; the old familiar
story is told that all the ore had been taken out, so it
didn’t matter at all if the stuff did go. Just the same
yarn was told when the Junction collapsed, five years
ago ; and that mine has been a cripple ever since. In the
present case, (1) there is a good deal of ore that had not
been taken out, and which probably never will be
reached now : (2) the collapse of the fissures running back
from it indicate a serious and widespread movement,
which may, possibly, affect Block 10 and the Sulphide
Corporation also (part of the milling plant of Block 10 is
certainly in danger) ; and (3) it isn’t likely to do any sys-
tem of timbering any good to have thousands of tons of
boulders crashing and weighing upon it. The B.H. Pro-
prietary is a very big mine and can stand hard knocks ;
and there is therefore the less sensem always pretending
that a thing like this isn t a knock at all. Possibly also
the directors did not yet want to be expected to give any
opinion about the new zinc process. All, in fact, that
can be said with certainty about that is that the tests on
a scale between that of the laboratory and the commercial
are highly encouraging. The principle can be put in a
few woods. There is a little sulphide of.iron in the zinc-
blende. The tailings, which contain this zinp-blende, are
put -in a trough with salt-cake solution. A fire, kept
going underneath, causes the sulphide of iron in the
solution to form sulphuretted hydrogen, and the small
bubbles of the gas cmry up with them the zinc particles,
which are then either skimmed or float off. In the tests
90 per cent, and over of the zinc has in this way been re-
covered. As to costs, nothing can be said ; and it is on
this rock that scores of processes which can do the work
right enough have been" wrecked. The co.’s particular
interest in this process is that it is its own property.
Nothing, shopt of a £5 rise in lead, could be more
important to Broken Hill than the evolution of a cheap
zinc process. Apart from the ore.in the mines there are
on the surface about four million tons of “ tailings,”
already crushed fine, and containing, besides silver and
lead, an average of 15 per cent: zinc. The B.H. Prop, has
about two million tons of that value; Blopk 10’S half-
million tons average over 22 per cent. Block 10 and che
Central officers still prefer the chanc.es of magnetic
separation, in which many improvements have lately been
made. A magnetic process ought. to be chgap ; whereas
in any acid process there is always some loss ofjchemicals,
and the loss,in practice cannot be accurately guaged by
the loss in the laboratory.

Araluen Central Dredge (N.S.W.) reports
“ another fine yield ” of 80foz. for 134 hours’ run. Co.

The hope of Mt. Hope, N.S.W., is broken.
The Melbourne syndicate, which owns the Great Central
mine, has practically- abandoned it after having spent
£60,000 on development and plant. Itjs not officially in-
timated that the mine is to-be abandoned} but the with-
drawal of the pumps and tlie pipes from the main shaft
must be regarded as conclusive evidence that such is the
intention. The owners are simply, letting' them-
selyes down lightly when they assert that' the
“continued low jjrice of copper is the principal
factor in influencing the decision to-suspend work.” It
is a public secret that Captain John Warren, who recently
inspected the mine, reported adversely on it. Failure to
find any considerable bodies of ore in the deeper ground
is the cause of closing down. The' eollapae will be a nasty
knock for some of the copper potentates ,of Melbourne.
They believed, on strength of a glowing report sub-
mitted to them by somebody who was supposed to
have condemned more mine proposals than any other
man iij Australia, that they had one of the biggest shows
on earth ; it was so good, indeed, that they did not want
any outsiders in it at all. Some of thegi, however, nave
the consolation of being associated with the Shuttleton
mine, latest reports, on which are of the most glowing
character. Those of the Great Central Syndicate who
are in the Shuttleton deal are happy ; those who are out
of it are wroth. It is not unlikely that the law courts
will be troubled with the business.

falls into Gehenna or the River Styx. Some of- the
brokers asked the committee to inquirer into the recent
ups and downs of the stock,-'and the committee declined
because it might have to- spend- its Xmas holidays
climbing down into'gasometers, sewer-pipes and garden-
wells looking for 1 broker’s ledgers. Then the press was
asked to “draw ” attention,to the restlessness-of Hustler’s

other workings), where it is lift. I 'wide-of highly payable

“ Shopki ” writes from Yodda Valley, British
Papua “ The Bulletin published, some months ago, the
alleged prices on this field of the principal food items, but
its correspondent could certainly not have been referring
to the rates ruling for the last 18 mo'nths, Living is cer-
tainly very dearlhere, but that’s because of the great cost
of transport. Present prices for a few principal items :
Flour per 5&1b., 655. ; rice per bag, 60s ; tea per lb. 3s. 6d ;
lib. tin of meat, 25.; bacon per lb., 2s. 9d:; butter per lb.,
3s. 6d.; sugar per lb. Is. 9d. Still, with even these prices
a fair average of miners are doing tolerably well. Your
Australian drought has evidently reached here, for we
have had hardly a drop of rain for the past five months.”

Mt. Morgan shares have increased in value
nearly £1,000,000 in the course of a week, which means
that a well-known Sydney resident may add six fat figures
to his already ponderous wealth. The improvement is
consequent on the discovery of the lode at 750 ft. At
latest advice the lode had been penetrated for 29ft., and
its average assay value for that distance is nearly ljoz.
per ton. The discovery of pay ore at this cjepth prac-
tically fixes no limit to the life of the mine which, prior to
this strike, was estimated to have 20 years’ work'in sight.
A call of 2s. 6d. per share ‘has been made and a div. of
2s. 6d. declared, the object being to'make the sharesfully

stock “listed"in London.

It is recorded, with much exultation, that North

shocking mismanagement if that cost were exceeded.

rise from ss. to £5, on cutting of the continuation of the

2700 tons of so-called pay ore a month, the erection of
further treatment plant seems hardly justifiable "on any
practical consideration. Before the mill. started two
years ago (a lot of development has been done since), ore
in sight was given as 90,000 tons, averaging 25dwts. So
far, 55,000 tons have been treated for an average of a
shade under 20dwts. What has become of the_ other
45,000 tons, not to mention the missing sdwbs. in the
average, and all the ore developed in the interval ?

Dr, Laver, the father of Laverton (W.A.), haa
been letting himself loose to a sympathetic press, scribe
anent the alleged libels published about his pet district.
He is especially wroth re the defamation of the Ida H.,
which, he alleges, “has one ore chute 100 ft. wide, and
the open cut carries an ore body 60ft. wide.” If such
were the case, the Ida H., with the “Boulder King”
behind it, would long ago have been provided with a 100-
head mill instead of pottering along with a 10-head.
As a matter of faot, the reef in the main block runs
from 2ft. to 4ft. wide, except a big Jolow called “Lady
Macquarie’s Chair.” In the north end of the south block
the reef is a mere stringer, and tails away to nothing,
considerably less than 100yds. from the north boundary.
A crosscut, put in at water level nearly across the lease,
failed to locate it or anything else of value. There is a
long chute of gold on the’ outcrop of the main block, but
that does not make a great mine. The irate medico goes
on to damn with faint praise the La-ncefield, just re-
jected, after a diamond-drill test,'by the Moreing crowd ;
the Augusta', long^closed’down by the owners; the
Golden Khine co. ; and the British Flag, which hasn’t
produced an* ounce of gold for years. But he avoids
all. mention of Mt. Barnlcoat, Hawk’s Nest and Childe
Harold, all-of which have had Bull’s money dumped into
them without any good result.

An intense Loyalty is the keynote of Pre-
mier Barton’s excuse for having officially denied
any knowledge of the fact that Lord Tennyson
was practically appointed to the Gov. General-
ship. Mr. Barton now admits that he knew of
the offer being made and accepted, but “ eti-
quette” required him to profess ignorance of the
matter until the King was graciously pleased to
confirm the appointment. This is all the-result
of Mr. Barton having witnessed the crowning of
Ed ward’s naked head-piece. He seems to regard

There is still hope for N.S. Wales. On
the ocoasion of removing the 'District Court
sittings from Coonabarabraii lately, the local
sheriff was directed to return the three brushes
and combs that, were sent there 20 years ago for
the jurors’ room. Two brushes, worth about Id.
each, were returned, but the combs were found to
be completely wrecked, through struggling with
the burrs that abound in jurors’ beards up Coona-
barabran way. Doubtless the brushes will corue
m handy for Governor-General’Tennyson when he
reaches the Macquarie-st. Govt. House.

Tasmania is 100 years old-in August, 1903.
The first colonists were ten male and six female
convicts sent from Sydney, who settled at Risdon,
near Hobart, where there is now a racecourse and
the remains of the first house. The Tasmanian
“first fleet” comprised but one ship—the Lady
Nelson, Lieut. John Bowen in command, with
Surge.on Jacob Mountgarret and Storekeeper
Williams. There isn’t much fuss being made
about the centenary in Tas., and perhaps any
celebration will be postponed till the next cen-
tenary, when the people will have had grand-
fathers.

Daily paper item :
The question of the Commonwealth contribution to the
Queen Victoria Memorial Fund in London is to be brought
before the Cabinet shortly.
Who is or was Queen Victoria ? Is there such a
place in N.S.W. as the Liverpool Tubercle Farm,
where consumptives are killed off (for lack of civi-
lised accommodation) at the rate of 50 per cent,
per annum? And in Victoria are not destitute
phthisical patients dying like flies for lack of a
sanatorium ?

The seamen’s trouble in
employers seeking to enforce a reduction of wages
on account of “bad times”—might very well be
settled by letting things stand as they are for six
months. By then it can be seen whether the
efforts of the seamen, assisted by the Labor Party,
to get adequate protection for the shipping
interest are likely to be successful. If they are
successful there will be no call for a reduction ; if
not, well the question of the wage rate can be
argued out on its merits then.

Whafc will lovely woman demand next ?
During the hearing of a recent divorce-case at
Sydney, it turned out that the woman seeking
release had not long before issued a writ, claiming
£5OOO damages for breach-of-promise from a man
whose acquaintance she had made after her
marriage! Justice Simpson having observed
that, considering the absolute impossibility of a
married woman maintaining a breach-of-promise
action, the proceeding was the most extraordinary
he had ever heard of—the lady’s legal adviser ex-
plained that he had thus acted because in, the case
of a woman fully entitled to a divoroe, as he
thought this woman was, where the promise was
made to marry her after she got a divorce, there
was a clear consideration.

Related (in N. Sydney News) that a
peculiar idea recently seized a teacher in a Sydney

a teat put in his mouth.

The John Alex. Dowie humbug had an
unwelcome qdvt. this month in Sydney, when a
woman of the Church of Zion died in child-birth,
refusing the medical attendance which would pro-
bably have saved her life. Part of Zion religion
is healing by faith, or prayer, or by sending cash
to J. A. Elijah Dowie, or some other pitiable sub-
stitute for antiseptic dressings and styptic band-
ages ; and at the official inquiry into the death of
the woman this doctrine was denounced as
“dangerous and even cruel.” Faith-healing
cures imaginary maladies, and that is about all.
There is no need to question as to whether
Providence can stop arterial bleeding and cure
rheumatoid arthritis by a miracle ; for it is quite
certain that Providence doesn’t.

Concerning bogus “ assauhs " on women.
There was some years ago a case in Maoriland
remarkable for ingenious stupidity. The resi-
dents_ of a Wellington suburb were scared one
morning by blood-curdling yells issuing from a
certain cottage. The screeches were found to
proceed from a servant-girl, tied to a bed-post in
her missus’s room. She told a harrowing tale
about having been criminally assaulted by two
masked men, who had then, with fearful threats,
tied her up with strips of sheet. But the knots
were all in front, and “grannies” at that, and
the damsel eventually confessed that she had tied
herself up, and that the criminal'assault yarn was
intended, in the future, to account for the “ con*
dition ” in which she already was.

‘ 5 Index ” on the State school displays in
N.S.W.:—
What I complain of is the cool way the Education
Dept, goes about the thing. As'soon as it is decided to
have a “ display," the children are chosen, and have to
buy caps, shoes, shirts and ties, bring their own lunch,
and pay tram-fares. True, children need not take part
In the display, but they are persecuted by their mates,
called “mean" and such things if they do not. Many
who cannot afford to buy the gear do so to save their
children from this.

“Sandpaper” re The Bulletin’s con-
demnation of the N.S.W. “school display” in-
fliction :
Another objectionable feature is the hard preparation
physical and mental, that children of all ages have to ’
undergo for months before the eventful day. The pre-
paratory physical training uses up so much time that it
becomes necessary to work the soul-cases out of the
children mentally to keep up the education standard.
Consequently there are extension of class hours, curtail-
ment of lunch time, and loads of home lessons. No
wonder that many parents—like myself—have positively
refused to allow their children to take part in such dis-
plays—which, by the way, are not always heat-ordeals.
I have seen them take place on cold, sleeting days—the
unfortunate kids shivering in the regulation dress of thin
white muslin. It’s hard to say which more characterises
the whole thing—silliness or barbarity.
Ballina (N.S.W.) has two publican J’s.P.
and one of them, the other day, sat on the bench
alone to adjudicate in the case of a man charged
with drunkenness.
AMIABLE.
HE: “In proposing I know I am neither young
enough nor good-looking enough to please
you ”
SHE: “Er, not at all! Ugliness has its
attractions for me."
At the Maoriland Local Option poll of
1896, 29 per cent, of the votes cast were for the
total abolition of drink-selling. At the 1902 poll
.36 per cent, of the votes were for Prohibition.
There are people now living who will survive long
enough to see the clammy apparition of Cold Tea
spread like a moral octopus over Maoriland from
one end to the other. They may even live to see
tobacco prohibited, and cigars declared accursed,
and gambling put down, and the horse abolished
as an animal that leads to undue excitement, and
oysters banned as immoral, and all the gas in the
city turned off at 10, and everybody compelled to
sleep with his door unfastened so that the police-
man (who will be a discreet, elderly person in
holy orders) may come in and identify him during
the night.

A Dunedin man writes :
The irresponsible combination, known as the Prohibition
party in M.L. and elsewhere, which has a misbegotten
propensity for monkeying with the political band-saw to
the damage of all and sundry, never, in its meat frenzied
moment, dreamed what would be the outcome of its
handiwork at the recent general election. The greater
half of it is now-lying awake at night wondering if Provi-
dence will send ravens to feed those to whom “striking
out the top line ” meant the loss of a living. The leaders
of the ginger-beer brigade sedulously fostered the idea
that there was no.great probability of Prohibition being
carried., but that a heavy No-licen'se vote would have the
effect of scaring the trade into a more rigid observance of
the licensing laws. Their misguided following acted on
the tip, and Prohibition was carried in six electorates
whereas it only existed in one before, while reduction was
carried in twice as many more. The heaviest
vote was cast in Otago. The leaven of BalcJutha, a by-
word from Three Kings to Foveaux Straits, extended and
infected Bruce andHataura, the electorates on either side,
and now a strip of land on the South-east coast of
some 250 sq. miles is about to be made a beer-
less waste. Invercargill, on the far end, only
escaped by eight votes, and the Prohibitionists are
moving heaven and earth to get a scrutiny to see if
they can use sufficient of the votes rejected as informal
to bring the no-license total up to the required three-
fifths. Awarua, the next electorate, was but a few votes
behind, and its fate also hangs in the balance. But the
sensation of the poll was in Port Chalmers, which, being
a seaport, was thought dead-safe from the trade stand-
point. They got a rude shock when the returns gave the
no-license vote a majority of 40 or 50 ! The irony of fate
decreed that one wretched beer-vendor should hustle
when the boundaries were altered to get out of Wai-
kouaiti into Chalmers, because he thought he was safe in
the latter. Result—a grisly spectre of ruin and bank-
ruptcy stares him in the face. Another publican in
Chalmers refused £5OOO for a property, a month before
the election, that he. would take £5OO for now. Ash-
burton (in Canterbury) and Newtown (in Wellington)
VO u-u Prohibition; but, as in every other case, the
prohibs. have to run the gauntlet of litigation, as the
trade will make a final effort in each case to have the poll
declared void on technical grounds.
A sample of solid front. In Red-
fern (Sydney), t’other day, a man entered a
pub., ordered a beer, and went to the rear
Here, seeing a recently-washed suit of
clothes hanging on a line, he put them on-
still wet—over his own ; then returned to
the bar and calmly proceeded to swallow
his drink. The landlord, recognising the
raiment, sought explanation, and received
instead a severe “ stoush ”in the eye. In
the resultant scrimmage the landlord, after
being severely bitten on the leg, managed
to “down” his assailant and hold him
till the police arrived.
During the recent curious action
against Vic. Railway Commissioners for
the loss of an eye, one of the medical witnesses
stated that he had known a man who had been
blind of pne eye for 50 years without being aware
of the fact. Taken literally, this amounts to
saying that for 50 years the man in question had
never closed his good eye and tried to see with the
other. ’

“ F.W,” writes :
“ Shellback’s ” defence of the average chioft officer.
(B. 29/11/’O2) is not altogether justified. If a chjqf is really
bent upon having his boats in good order, a vyord to that
effect on arrival at home port will easily gel, substitutes
for his winchmen, leaving him four men to, qycrhaul the
boats and lowering gear—ample, in my estimation, to do
the lot in a day. Also, colliers with six lpen only require .
four to shift ship in a coal-port, leaving tyio and occasion-
ally a boatswain or lamp-trimmer to overhaul the three
or four boats they usually carry. This, done monthly
would keep them in good order. As to « S.’s ’’ assertion
that it takes six or eight men to lift the average lifeboat
out of the chocks : I am myself mate of a collier, and any
one of my three lifeboats can be easily lifted by two men
at each end. But then my blocks have patent roller- '
sheaves, the fall isn’t too large for the blocks, and ,
the blocks themselves are in perfect working order.
Concerning inspection. Some years ago I was in a boat
in the W.A. trade and in Sydney every time the boats .
were carefully inspected by the proper authorities. But ’
I have seen them—having “ passed " one ship—cross the
wharf to inspect another, and whilst busy on one side,
sundry articles of boat equipment were quietly conveyed :
from the passed •elto do duty a second time on the
craft under examination. Now, I believe that the ,
mate himself was- to blame for this shortage in gear, as no ,
co. would refuse to supply any article of boat equipment
as required by Board of Trade. In the matter of pro-
visioning boats, some adequate means must be found of
keeping water and food (latter, if possible, in tabloid j
form) in a place inaccessible to salt water. For water 1/
would suggest a pipe running completely round the boatf
beneath the gunwale, large enough to carry 25 gallons, in,
addition to the breakers now carried; and for food a,
watertight box, beneath the thwart, always full of stuff'
which should be often changed. How many stewards, by
the way, would leave the deck of a sinking ship to run
below for provisions ?

N.S.W. Labor Commissioners reckon that
there are 6000 or 7000 chronic unemployed in and
around Sydney. Many have been “on the
books ever since the State Labor Bureau was
started 10 years ago. The greater number are far
too tired to ever look in at the office ; but the
registration card comes in handy when the weary
one wants to convince some doubting citizeness
that he has been “trying hard, mum, to get
work.” The Commissioners report bluntly that
the worst thing to do for this class is to feed it
without making it work. _ Next to that the least
profitable thing is to pay it by the hour or day or
week.

Just what is liable to happen when a
Judge or an Executive flouts a jury (to inflict,
not to relieve punishment) was shown at the last
Quarter Sessions at Broken Hill. At the last
Circuit Court there, two shearers were charged
on three counts. The jury found them guilty on
a technical offence, and strongly recommended
them to mercy ; nevertheless, Judge Pring passed
sentence of 12 months, with a further two years
in default of providing securities. The jury,
astonished at the severity of the punishment,
unanimously petitioned in a few weeks for the
men’s immediate release; yet, nearly three months
after, when the session were held, they were still
m gaol. Then this happened: two other men,
who admitted to taking part in precisely the same
adventure as the others, and who called no evi-
dence for their defence, were acquitted straight
out! It was Judge Docker’s turn to be astonished
then.

From Melbourne last week, were sent a

Why do we sweat so but to eat, and eat
To sweat again ? Where is the profit ? Whose?
And yet, perforce, we do it, or we die.
Is it not strange that life’s so hugged, that we
Spend ourselves so but for our dieting,
Imperil our safety, prodigal our peace,
Dare death but to be on good terms with life
Which, when most sure, ’a such an uncertaii
tiling!—
Were life but of such stuff as thought is made
And we but battened on desires and dreams
Time were a music to whose motion we
Moved mystically on from hour to hour,
Free as the air that lifts a cloud and takes
The evening colors on its quiet wing ;
And this we may be when our bodies fail,
And the soul slips out of its cloudy veil !

Mr. “Sam” Hordern, of Sydney, comes
back from Europe with the goodold yara<(Heaven
only knows how often we have heard that yarn !)
about an English capitalist (name not
was coming out here to start a great industry in
compressed grasshoppers, or in making keyholes
out of ox-tail, or something (no particulars are
given), which industry was to employ 1000 hands
(why is it always the exact 1000, never 971 ?);
but who fled in disgust when he saw the nefarious
results of Labor legislation. It is curious that
that spectral capitalist never brought his huge
factory here in the bygone years when there was
no Labor party, no labor legislation, no one-man-
one-vote. Now, with all these things local manu-
facturing industries, backward as they are, are
progressing faster than they ever did before, and
m 1901 N.S.W., the State Mr. Hordern belongs
to, showed the largest increase in manufac-
turing employment yet recorded in one year. And
this even though the anonymous Englishman who
was going to employ 1000 men in his great
new factory for making something, the name
of which is omitted, is always going away in dis-
gust. It is a pity, perhaps; but what is the name
of that Englishman, and what was he going to
make, and why on earth didn’t he come in the
days before there was Labor legislation? Also,
can’t the miserable animal read, that he never
knows anything about the laws of this country till
be arrives on the quay and sees the unspeakable
results of Labor legislation rushing at him down

Rev. Matthew Walker, a Lucknow
(N.S.W.) parson, has been released from gaol
(where he was serving a sentence for perjury, and
another for refusing to give evidence) some
months before the expiry of his term of
punishment —an action for which no rea-
sonable person will abuse the N.S.W. Govt.
Perjury is such a common offence, and so very un-
commonly punished, that the gaoling of a man for
it always has the air of an injurious caprice ; and
to condemn a man already in gaol for perjury to
further punishment for refusing to give sworn
evidence is “rubbing it in” with a vengeance.
Mr. Walker, by the way, seems to have had the
confidence of his flock throughout, and his wife
kept his pulpit warm for him during his term in
gaol.

“ Hermes ” tells an idyll of the sixpenny
I sat in the stern of the Parramatta River boat with a
dingy and smoke-grimed Union Jack floating over my
head and a young couple sitting on my right, The man
smoked serenely, and the girl watched the man. Pre-
sently the girl spoke, very softly : You
mustn’t dream of going away without me ; I
could never agree to it. . . . Dearest, think of
my dreadful loneliness, for I’ve no one now
but you. I had no one at all when we met,
and you have grown to be part of my life, and
I can’t do without you, dear ; really I can’t.
Look, darling, if you attempt to go away
without me, I’ll throw myself into the
harbor as the steamer starts ” The man
interrupted Well, they’d fish you out and
lock you up before you could drown. I hate
this talk of murder and self-destruction ; it’s
real low.” The girl sat silent for a few
minutes in a brown study, her eyes glued to
the tips of her shoes. Then she started
again : “ Oh, no, no, no; I could never let
you go without me. You’d be sure to get
tangled up-with some woman, and forget all
about me. Really, dear, I couldn’t trust you
away from me for a week ; I couldn’t let you
go—l won’t let you go. Listen! If you
attempt to go away without me ” (she leaned
over impressively, and a red spot burned in
each ,cheek and her hands clenched), ‘ ‘ I’ll
stab you, my darling ; I will; I’ll stab you—
stab you dead." (Suddenly changing to
tenderness without passion): “ What will
you do, deary ?’’ The man looked grave, and
then replied, solemnly, “ Wear_ a kerosene-

Quite a number of Queensland doctors are

cure for cancer, since a couple of Northerners are
said to have been relieved of the disease by that
means. One man had a growth under the tongue
that almost choked him. By accident he dis-
covered that molasses, though biting at first,
gave ultimate relief, and so he continued taking
it, with the result that in 10 days the supposed
cancer disappeared. Another man claims to have
been similarly cured of cancer in the stomach ;
and the medicoes are now watching a case of
apparent stomach-cancer which has been placed
under the molasses treatment in Gympie hospital.
Patients are also being experimented upon in

“ Dubbo ” writes a letter of much interest
to working women :
Editor Bullbtim, —“Index,” in a letter re school
teachers, says “he knows something about N.S.W.
Education Department. Several female teachers assure
me they are worse off than laundry-slaves.” Perhaps
“Index’s" informants know a lot about the E.D., but
they evidently don’t know much about laundry-con-
ditions, though, if “ Index” refers to “ the woman at the
tub,” he may be all right as regards Sydney,
where I believe she gets, as a rule, 3s. 6d. a day and no
meals. If some of the school teachers, dressmakers, lady
helps and governesses went to the public-laundry ironing-
table they would be more independent, earn far better
money, and work fewer hours than they do. I know, for I’ve
run a laundry, and the worry I had to get girls turned my
hair grey. A good shiit-ironer, working from Bto 6, can
earn over £2 a week, and if the boss so much as looks at ’em
sideways, they’ll say “ Good-bye, old boy ; I’ll make you
a present of my wages”—any owing for the current week.
I had a laundry in the country. I advertised for “ all-
round ironers ” in the Sydney papers at “ top prices
Is. 9d. a doz. for ironing and polishing shirts, and they
can do 4 doz. a day ; I advertised for them at £2 a week,
and then I advertised for them at £1 a week and good
board, and got no applications. If some of the women
who have muscular girls fooling around with the piano or
dressmaking at ss. a week, or standing in shops all day,
sent them to a laundry, where the majority are respect-
able, they could earn what I say after six months’, or
less, experience. The demand is greater than thesupply.
The work is hard for the first month until they get
broken in, but what work-is not hard at first ! “ Index,*’
in writing about laundry-workers in the way he does,
helps to keep up the existent false idea that laundry girls
are sweated despite the fact that they are the only class
who demand and get their price every time—i.e., if they
are worth anything. My girls used to complain to me of
the way the dressmakers, &c., looked down on them—
how they would pull their skirts aside as the laundry
workers passed ; but the laundry girl has money to spend,
can dress better, and earns it herself. Which is more
than the majority of dressmakers can say with any
truthfulness.

A bold, bad man from Melbourne :
These transparent yokes the women wear—the open-
fronted blouses with lace furbishings, or whatever they
call them —begin to interest me ; they have so many fear-
some possibilities. I observe that the higher the ther-
mometer the lower the ladies dress and the more trans-
parencies they mount. The most attractive of all these
creations are, of course, those where flesh-color contrasts
with all-black. Such a one risked a catastrophe t’other
afternoon on the Block. She was with a lady and
gentleman, and was herself outre. Practically she wore
a very low-necked evening gown, with the aforesaid
transparencies that conceal, yet reveal so much. She
was up-to-date in the matter of corsets—i.e., she dispensed
with them—and I am prepared to make oath that
she had done ditto with most of her other gar-
ments. Four times during the promenade of the
Block her escort trod on the hem of her skirt;
he seemed beastly careless, didn’t even apologise ; pos-
sibly he was her husband. Anyhow, the result of these
mis-steps was that the lace gave way at the rear, and the
rest of the garment began slowly slipping downwards. A
catastrophe was imminent, but the lady friend grasped
the situation, and hastily rushed the other into a handy
tea-room. I would like to remark that the woman of
fleshy habit should not go about uncorseted and with a
transparent yoke—she. is too flabby. Also, I wonder at
times what would happen to me if I strolled down the
street with a piece of fly-netting where the upper half of
my shirt should be, and only my pants and hat on ; and
how far I would get before I was run in for insulting be-
haviour, or something.

affairs for which Nature designed them.
By taking this advice they will gain the respect of

From a serious-minded corres-

Editor Bulletin,—Let me, through the
medium of your disreputable paper, draw
the attention of the W.C.T.U. to the urgent
necessity of a crusade for the abolition of
the big shop window. The harm done by
this nefarious institution is incalculable.
Women congregate in front of these es-
tablishments, staring at the millinery and
frippery displayed, and the bad man who
is always walking abroad seeking for ewe
lambs to devour knows that these big
windows are the places to catch ’em. Re-
spectable men toiling hard at business for
the maintenance of their dear ones (ah!) are
forced by the crowd of feminine gapers to step
out into the roadway from the shelter of the
verandahs into the sun, and are thereby
smitten with a thirst that drives them to the
bar. There they are made drunk, and next
morn sees a contrite and sore-headed husband
and father fined 10s. for assaulting his dear
ones while under the influence of the liquor
he got to quench his thirst, caused by the
crowd in front of the show window driving
him into the sun. The big drapery displays,
especially, should be suppressed ruthlessly
as mere plundering organisations. Women
are by them tempted to buy things they do
not really require and which they cannot
afford. As a lamber-down the publican simply
isn’t “init ” with the big draper. The draper
plunders the defenceless married man just as
thoroughly by means of his big window dis-
play as the footpad does when he knocks his
victim down with a sandbag and goes through
him while he is insensible. The. only differ-
ence is that a man has a chance with the foot-
pad, and with the other robber he has none.
Bnt it is in the interests of those dear young
creatures just budding into womanhood (Ah !)
that I write. More girls have been lured to
destruction by the “duck of a hat” or the
“ dream of a silk underskirt ” they saw in the
big shop window than ever went astray
through drinking fermented and spirituous
liquors. The virtue that can hold out against
theatres and suppers goes down smash before
the latest thing in chiffon hats and silk under-
skirts ; and the love of a tailor-made is
stronger than that of the pallid bloom of a
gameless life ; and when the wages of sin are
silk and satin, starred with gems, human con
tinence is as the grass which perisheth.

At Dunedin (M.L.), recently, an enter-
prising female entered a prominent bookseller’s
shop and ordered the elderly bachelor proprietor
to pay a “bob,” otherwise she would strip
naked on the spot. The “bob” was promptly
handed over, and the extortioner next tried it on
with a young woman in a fruit-shop. This time
she had got down to her last garment
when the girl’s pa arrived with a policeman.
They escorted the performer, just as she stood,
to a waiting cab, amidst a throng of larrikins and
screeching women ; and, as the cab drove off, the
bobby was seen gallantly tying the lydy’s gar-
ments round her neck.

send a wire home, addressed just like that. Now
she is content with a modest “Jones, Chatswood.”
As the G.P.O. is a tired department it doesn’t
bother overmuch about getting the right Jones,
and then there is trouble.

Grafton and a South Grafton, with
only 5000 people between them; a
Maitland East and a Maitland
West, with together just 10,000
people; a Narrabri and a Narrabri
West, the latter a bloated place with
680 people; an Orange and an
Orange East; a Singleton and a Sin-
gleton South, the latter with less
than a thousand, mostly females.
Also, there is Newcastle with 55,000

WHEN THE
PLANK IS DRAWN.
ron the steamer, she upon the pier ;
A stranger to her, she to me a stranger—
My ocular advances brought a sneer,
A sign that she anticipated danger.
So then I took the hobbles off my eyes,
And let them rip to trample an impression,
Stampeding o’er her beauty to surprise,
Perchance, some slight reciprocal concession.
But still she froze, until the plank, was drawn ;
And, as the boat was round the headland turning.
She challenged me with smiles of sweetness born
And glances like to something that is burning.
That’s how we rarely kiss whom we desire ;
Oirls keep their love like bow-wows in a manger *
But give me girls who will return your fire
Before the distance puts them out of danger.

*• The doctrine of ‘ don’t care ’ has taken a great hold
on them (the people of England). Largely the cause is
pleasure-seeking and Sunday excursions to all the sea-
side places near London. They will take them 80 or 100
miles for 3s. or 45., and large numbers go. Loose views
on the Sabbath question had a great deal to do with
breeding this indifference."—Baptist Parson Cuff.
We must really take the “ huff"
At this pious Mister Cuff,
Who thus Shatters our delusions in a blow 1
We’d been taught the English people
Gathered weekly ’neath the steeple—
Every Sabbath at the pulpit bowing low.
That the secret of their greatness
Was their splendid out-of-dateriess —
To the ancient Hebrew, Moses, they were true ;
And by being meek and lowly,
And thro’ keeping Sunday holy
They kept Providence at hand to see them through.
Every time we’d inclination
To take Sabbath recreation,
We were straightway with its wickedness impressed,
By a tale of how the nations
Given to such degradations
By decreasing populations were distressed.
We were warned of their sad fate,
And were urged to emulate
England’s holiness, which made a nation great J
To avoid sins transcendental,
Like the Sunday Continental,
For ’twould bring the Lord’s dire wrath upon the State J
So it’s sudden, and it’s rough
To be told by Parson Cuff,
Of the hollowness of all our notions grand;
For this pious person blabbeth
That the Continental Sabbath
Is a cherished institution in the holy Motherland.

The year 1901 —the one when the Common-
wealth’s Protective tariff came into force—saw the
largest increase of employment in N.S.W. manu-
facturing industries yet recorded in any one
year. And N.S.W. wanted that employment
very badly indeed. When the tariff debate was
on importer M‘Millan uttered these prophetic
words:
Victorians are making a mistake in agitating for high
duties, as they will result in N.S.W. becoming a great
manufacturing State and securing the trade from their
Victorian rivals.
M'Millan voted consistently against the policy
which, he said, would make N.S.W. a great
manufacturing State —he, as an importer, plainly
didn’t want it to become one. But he wasn’t so
successful as he probably expected, and the results
are shown above.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
(Sydney, December 9, 1902.
My Dear Arini—
I have been in our Mountains for a space. Thei
purple was blotted out by spindrift winding-sheets,
and live thunders skipped from peak to peak the
whole time. There wasn’t much “ brace ”in the
atmosphere* but there were many lovable old
ladies on the hotel balconies who asked me if 1
1 1 ad read “Mister Raskin’s ‘Open See-same”*;
and who knitted long black silk stockings “which
would last seven years and contained seventeen
shillings’ worth of silk in each pair ”; and who
discussed the franchise intelligently and “won-
dered if nuns would vote, and, if so, would they
go to the booth in secular dress, in which they
would feel very, very strange ; or if they would
vote by proxy.”
Our hill country is significantly untenanted
compared with this time of former years. One
big hotel has 7 boarders and 17 servants. Another
big hotel I struck had one boarder, an Anglo-
Indian—mostly liver. He looked at me on my
first entrance into the dining-room as if I were a
badly-made curry, and complained to the waiter
of the crushing and crowding in these hotels. I
believe he found another 30-roomed hostel where
there was no other boarder.
On a morning I was cycling along a valley track
when a woman, spent with running and sallow-
white with terror, almost fell in front of my wheel.
A bush fire (the heat between the thunder showers
was awful) was approaching her tent “in which
she had the furniture of a five-roomed house,” and
she begged me to call her kin who were working
on the railway lines. They were on the
spot within a few minutes, and were beating out
the last flickers when the poor woman struggled
back, still under great excitement. She was
about 60 years of age. “Ah me,” she shrilled,
waving her arms at the firemen, “never another
live-born will I bear after this fright.” Later I
asked her if any of her children were with her.
“No,” said she, simply, “I never had a ohild” ;
and she began to feed a baby owl with a shredded
locust.
There seems to be prevalent an idea among
N.S.W. women that the franchise, which they got
recently, carries with it a license to shoot on small
provocation. Quite a number of females have
been shooting at men lately. The constables who
are instructed to coax the ladies to come on the
roll should also be told to give a hint on this point
to lovely woman—that she nas only the same snoot-
ing right as before, no more and no less. It may-
be that man will now begin to take woman seri-
ously and make her pay according to her success-
ful marksmanship—same as a man. But it is
difficult to take seriously people who tie them-
selves to bannisters and accuse bad, bold men of
having done the granny-knotting prior to robbing
the house. Also the woman who sues a man for
breach of promise before she has divorced her first
husband, will, according to some rules, be a proof
that the sex requires saltixm with humor and pep-
pering with logic. '
One of the R.C. bishop*, speaking at the laying
of the foundation-stone of tne Brigidine Convent
at Randwick by newly-returned Cardinal Moran,
deplored, as a weakness in the character of the
Irish, the naming of their Australian-born children.
He had figured out that only 2 per cent, of the
girls whose pa was Patsy or Michael went into life
flaunting the name of Brigid. Quite so. In the
words of one of Ethel Turner’s children, “Brigid
ain’t no name for a lydy.” What matter to the
Irish-Australian that St. Brigid, who lived some-
where about the beginning of Time, was a princess,
when Brigid to-day shortens to “ Biddy,” and with
the mother-in-law joke and the hiccup joke graces
every issue of the comic papers. Besides, “Biddy”
has become slang for servant. “I’m going to a Re-
gistry Office to look for a Biddy,” you’ll often hear
from women seeking a “general.” A while ago,
someone was entreating an outback lady to give
her infant the name of Brigid. The mother mur-
mured something about a “ vulgar name,” and the
advocate for the saintly cognomen pointed out that
various earls and marquises in Ireland always had
a Brigid and a Norah among their family names.
“That’s all right,” said the outback mother,
“ Brigid is very grand if you’ve got a ‘ Lady ’ or
an ‘ Honorable ’ in front of it, but I mean to call
mine Irene May.”
If Melba isn’t a Fine Art all to herself in Grand
Opera she is artfully fine and artlessly artful as
singer and actress. The Cranbrook magnates,
attended by Mr. Robertson Clarke, came along to
her final performance on Saturday night from the
Dolores finale. Admiral Beaumont and a lot of
gold lace and officers toned the house. In her
golden wig in Violetta and Marguerite, Melba
took on a strong likeness to her two fair-headed
sisters, the Mitchell girls, who watched her from
a box. Beautiful flowers and enthusiastic applause
made the star’s exit a brilliant one.
When I read of the great jewel robbery at Mr.
Walter Gollin’s Woollahra mansion, “Quambi,”
it wasn’t the 18-caratness of the burgled goldware
or the diamonds that roused my admiration, but
the soundness of the sleep of Mr. Gollin, his
household and guests. Such of us, whom the
chirp of a cricket would waken, wish we had half
“Quambi’s” complaint. “I have (not) lost
the sound child-sleeping which the thunder could
not break.” Mr. Gollin might have made that
quote when he rose in the morning and found
his bedroom window wide open, his clothes strewn
about, and his desks and drawers broken open.
The other rooms were similarly treated, yet the
sleepers wakened not. Captain Blue, a stepson
of Chief Justice Way, of S. A., was a guest, and
he didn’t wake when his garments were being gone
through. By the way, his pocket-book, contain-
ing £lB, was on the table near his bed, but as it
looked like a little Bible the robbers neglected it.
Observation : The Quambi suppers must be very
gooj.
WANTED, at once, Housekeeper for small station
” near Dalby ; young and good-looking one pre-
ferred, £7O. Apply , c/o Goldsbrough, Mort,

No anonymity about that advt. Advertiser and
address unexceptionable. One may imagine the
desperate bachelors rushing the advt. off to the
papers, after giving notice (with each a foot in
their stirrups) to the elderly housekeeper with the
vixen face and the hay-bag figure, whose temper
matched her face, and whose housekeeping was
even worse than her figure.
Mr. Jack Want, his wife and stepdaughters,
are preening their wings and gripping their grips
for travel. They leave next Saturday, and will
be abroad fourteen months.
Roland Watts-Phillips, who is with the Wil-
loughby-Geaeh co., soon to be in Sydney, sends
from Maoriland, as Xmas greeting, a picture
post-card, “ Maori Beauties ”; but one of the
damsels is no more Maori than Roland herself—
she’s a lovely white girl masquerading in a mat
and pheasants’ feathers. M.L. picture post-cards
are generally full of local color and distinction.
Those issued by the “ Government Department of
Tourists and Health Resorts ” show the most
attractive views of the islands and pf the Maori
Kaiangas.
A. race for motor-launches, the first event of its
kind in Sydney waters, came off last Saturday, in
Neutral Bay. A big section of Sydney women
has a feather or two of the seagull or albatross or
frigate bird in its nature, and likes to smile on
the face of the waters from the deck of a flagship
when a lot of nice men are scudding about
in boats, competing for electro-plate prizes.
For this motor-launch race, women turned out
in hundreds. These motors are ideal craft for our
harbor. Wouldn’t be surprised to see the out-
door girls adopt them and give golf a rest.
Messrs. Ed. Noyes, Chris Neilson, E. Sayers, and
Dr. Hodgson have perfect caramels of motor
launches, which finished the race in the order
named.
Pennies, nearly £5O worth, were collected at the
Mutosoope afternoon in aid of Hospital Saturday
fund last week. Mutoscope looks like a combina-
tion of a penny-in-the-slot, try-your-weight
machine and a letter-box. It stands about five feet
high, and there’s a little handle at the side, and a
glass window about the size of your forehead in
the top. You put your penny in the slot, screw
your eyes to the pane and turn the handle. Keep
on turning, don’t be discouraged, and a short series
of pictures illustrating one subject will unfold.
The subject of the picture you are to see is displayed
on the outside of your machine, otherwise you
might be startled and say as you fled, “ This is no
place for me.” I chose “The Black Cat,” and
churned out a series of views showing an imp of a
boy forcing Grimalkin under a heavy dish-cover
on a table laid, “real elegant,” for two. The boy
disappears, a waiter backs in, ushering a charming
piece of Fluff, leaning on the arm of a real Percy
Reginald. Waiter removes lady’s wraps and
backs out. Fluff and P.R., smiling and bowing
towards each other, take their chairs; the man
raises the dish-cover, and the cat springs erect on
its hind legs and—you hear your copper drop and
the show is over. It lasts a minute or so.
My picture was not much rushed, but there
were men waiting 20 deep around ’scopes at far
end of the room to see something a little undraped.
By expending twelve pennies you may get quite a
liberal mutoscopic education, including “Artists’
Models” and “Dreams,” and the Kansas City
Fire Brigade going into action, and the rescue of
men falling overboard at sea.
Hilda Mulligan and Sylvia Blackstone make, as
far as I know, the third and fourth voices which
Melba has “passed ” as worthy Marchesi’s tuition.
The star tested Miss Mulligan on a Thursday,
and Sylvia last Sunday, and confirmed Dolores’
opinion _of Sylvia’s voice. Meantime, the little
singer is to undergo the “rest-cure,” as her
nerves are all discords and her notes on edge
through over-practice. Melba gave Miss Mulligan
a letter of introduction to Marchesi, and the little
Manly singer will go to Europe early next year.
Sick Children’s Hospital profited to the extent
of a nice little cheque by Miss Rose Lyne’s pupils’
conoert and display of fancy dancing on Monday
night. Pupils presented the teacher with a gold
cable bangle.
I wish some missioner would start a series of
revival meetings with “ Thou shalt not steal, ” and
that only for text, and make a speciality of
addressing the North Shore. Of course there may
be just as many snappers and pickers-up of pro-
perty on other lines, but I speak after failing to
recover a single one of the 15 or 20 articles—
umbrellas, books, gloves, eggs, a dog, a pound of
coffee-beans, a beetle (in diamonds and rubies),
two fountain-pens, and other things which took
advantage of my absent-mindedness to stay
behind, on or under the seat which I had oocupied.
If one of the crew of the N.S. fleet finds your
lost property you will always get it again,
but the crew hasn’t opportunities—it isn’t
around like the general public. “ It’s women that
lifts things off these boats ! ” explained a constant
traveller to me; “ quite decent women that
wouldn’t dream of stealin’ out of your pocket, or
the mat from your street door.” The columns of
“Lost” posted outside the ferry offices are a
severe indictment of the honesty of a section of
the public. The “Founds” are not worth men-
tioning, being about three to 150 of the former.
Talking of theft, Miss Rose Scott’s handbag was
stolen from the table at which she sat the night
of the Sangal meeting. Probably the thief
believed in capital punishment, and was an anti-
suffragist as well.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The Guv’nor-Clarkes progressed under diffi-
culties to their allotted niche in the Town Hall
balcony at the grand pirouette of Mrs. W. Green’s
pupils the other night. It was stiff business to
work a way through the crammed galleries;
When the quaint and wonderfully-garbed
youngsters took the. floor for the whimsical
curvetings of the minuet, the skill shown was
amazing; small mites not much past the bib and
tucker period played Betty Modish and Lovelace
with a precocious air of mimicry. There were
bevies of dancing youngsters, whose movements
all showed elasticity and grace.
‘ * Irene Dillon was one of the few to get away in
a pas de seul from all professional models with a
charming representation of ‘the Spirit of the
Dance.’ She rioted for 10 minutes in a faseinat-
ing labyrinth of steps. Cleverness of a subtler
kind marked the 4 Shadow Dance ’ of Meyerbeer’s
‘Dinorah,” by Miss Florrie Green.
“It would seem from recent dancing demon-
strations that all the rising generation of Vic-
torians are equipping themselves for the stage.
Parents, with a regard to their children’s 4 deport-
ment, ’ despatch them early to teachers of dancing;
then the dance fascinates, and their eyes turn
stagewards. Yet this country lacks sadly
women who can grill chops, make salads, and
hold their tongues wisely; it suffers from
an over-plus of actresses and alleged actresses.
Can’t some mothers of sense be found to search
out and patronise an academy where they teach
potato-mashing instead of pirouetting and laundry
work instead of languishing ? There can be no
more harmful lesson for young brats —male or
female—than that of posturing in publio.
“Miss Davies, who didn’t tootle at Melba’s
makeshift reception at the University Conserva-
torium, intending to storm the Diva at the Town
Hall concert the next night, must have been
pleased when, at the last moment, Melba’s
presence there was denied.
“ Miss Emily Stevenson failed to do her light,
sweet voice justice when Melba sat in the Con-
servatorium chair to hear her, as she had worked
herself into an hysterical state of nervousness.
At the Town Hall students’ annual trial, next
night, she sang with greater sweetness and spirit.
Lady Silverlocks, that night, was among the
frockiest of the audience, in black and silver.
“A great advocate of Christian Science, who
has of late reduced her rotundity—the upper deck,
that is—to a wonderful extent, tells her friends
delightedly how to bant. Great faith filled her
heart when she started on the mission of thinning
according to the principles of this cult. 4 Down
bosom!’ she admonished her over - abundant
frontage 20 times a day. In trains, in trams, in the
street, in the house, wherever the mind was free
from occupation, the words 1 Down Bosom ! ’ were
repeated. In three months the flesh had responded
to the cry of the spirit (so she says), and her pro-
portions were no longer the despair of her dress-
builders. Some lean girls in the fashionable
ranks are now earnestly exhorting their skimpy
what-ycu-may-call-’ems to rise to the occasion,
and 20, aye 40, times a day the words, “ Rise,
hips ! ” are zealously repeated. Progress on this
point will be reported later.
“ The masseuse is dealing with the ‘ sun frown.’
They speak of it in the beauty-parlors as seriously
as though it were appendicitis. The face-rubber
and greaser who knows her business falls into
tears over a mildly crinkled brow. ‘Why did
you not come sooner?’ she asks, piteously.
Then the creased client falls a prey to the treat-
ment, and does penance for her tardiness.
“ Cardinal Moran wore his most austere air all
the way out from London, so his Orontes fellow-
passengers say. He spoke to no man—and looked
at no woman. The only time he showed any
emotion was at meal hours. For the rest he stood
afar off, buried his face in pious works, and told
his beads with a cold countenance turned towards
the surging sea. The same decks boasted the
presence of the Cliveden dowager, who had all her
boxes labelled ‘Jeannette Lady Clarke,’a little
conceit caught at Paree. Her circle on the
Orontes was strictly circumscribed.
“The Cliveden dowager’s tribute to her hus-
band’s lamented memory was made in a public
fashion the day of her return to Melbourne. A
great number viewed the act of the widow in
placing a wreath of Paris immortelles on the
statue of the late baronet with tearful emotion.
The widow was appropriately dressed for the
ceremony in half-mourning lilac with black
periods. She looked ill for all her girlish spright-
liness and was forced to lie up with malarial fever
a day or two later.
““Senator ‘Bob’ Best faced the matrimonial
music for a second time in his life last Wednesday.
The bride was Miss Maude Crocker Smith, from
Melbourne’s musical ranks. The ceremony at
Christ Church was imposing enough, with the
bridal array of ivory satin and the blonde smile-
fulness of the bridegroom, but it was nothing io the
glitter of the reeeptioninSt. Kilda Town Hall, with
all the Commonwealth political element present.
If noise represents jollity, this Senator’s hitching-
up is to be reckoned absolutely the merriest that
has ever sequelled a courtship. Probably a more
smilesome couple never sat under a wedding-bell.
“The Federal Attorney-General is seldom
heard out of the House or off the platform/as he
persistently eschews social affairs. But he made
an exception for the Best bridal, and tossed off a
natty speech on the delicate subject of Love.
After this fascinating Deakin feat, the gathering
did not relish much the labored phrases of Mr.
Barton, or the extravagant harangue of White
Knight Fitzgutter,. who babbled of brides and
bridesmaids and beauty and virtue to the point of
ridicule.
“ Most of Melb. Society moves to Tasmania for
the hot months. Many reckoned on the Huttons,
who are lavish entertainers, taking their house-
hold to Tassy for the first two months of ’O3, but
the Federal fire-eater finds affairs of office too
pressing to neglect just now, and his dutiful dame
remains by his side. Two rich widows threaten
to take villas and keep the Hobart ball rolling.
“The fashionable paddler in populous places
takes her dip in the frilliest of bifurcated shirts, a
sun hat, and a gossamer! The dip in the Summer
baths thus developes into a police paddle, a waye-
sprinkle, a very partial wet. Healthy, robust,
knock-about plungers look upon the gossamered •
bather with scorn, and do their best to douche the
daintily-pedicured and protected darlings. The
question is, whom are they designed to charm ?
The rude peeping Toms outside the baths can’t
tell one airy fairy from another. Then what’s the
get-up for ? and why is the plunge sacrificed for
wasted vanity ?
“Our ‘Lady Mayoress’ bridles up to her new
title well. You might heap the coals of titular
distinction on Mayoress Gillott’s head till your
sauttle was exhausted, and still that sturdy body
would smile, calmly reflecting tha} she was
worthy of them.
“Hips are, like the price of meat, rising
alarmingly. ‘lmprovers’are resorted to in the
form of wide-starched linen pleats, to extend over
the sides and back. This extension slip must
reach down almost to the knees so that the wearer
is sure of sitting on it. The untidy woman makes
the mistake of a hip-pad that is obvious, and
forms, when the wearer is seated, a disfigurement
by bolstering up about the Waist. The skirt of
the hour looks ‘ blown out ’ —and to be smart you
must get that inflated hip look.
“ Last week the Federal Exhibition changed
hands, and the proprietor is now M. Denat, of
the well-known Cafe Denat, of Melbourne, who
has always been one of the chief financiers of the
show. He has plenty of good promises that
things will hum in future at the Exhibition.
Meals are served now not only ih a dining-hall, but
in the open air under large shady trees, which are
hung at night with brilliant Chinese lanterns, and
the waitresses are dressed in the pretty costumes
of the European peasantry. The effeot is very
charming.
“Celia Ghiloni was ill-placed as the casual
Signora in ‘Paul Jones.’ In fact, she has
not had a part suitable to her florid style and
the peculiar qualities of her operatic top notes
since her ‘lolanthe’ role. There is a notable
weediness of understandings just now among the
charmers of the chorus. Stella Esdaile, Kate
Milner, and many others have been ‘visibly’
thinned down by a brisk season of precipitate
changes. The whole co. wants a six months ‘rest
cure ’ to encourage Nature’s sawdust and save the
reefing-in of the company’s properties. Carrie
Moore and Maud Chetwynd are vanishing to
pencil-points—but no amount of graft interferes
with Florrie Young’s prosperous person.
“The Whittington panto, cast will include
three smart twinklers formerly moving in the
social orbit. One novice relates how she prepared
for the test exams. She encased her thin sup-
porters in four pair of cashmere hose, and added
to her stature by means of “elevators.” Even
then she apologised blushfully to Mistress Minnie
Everett for her scanty parts, and humbly offered
her excuses, but that Eminent Arbiter pooh-
poohed the diffidence and tersely passed them
with * They’ll do —the shape’s fair—the rest

“ Melbourne boasts the presence of Miss Fox-
Strangways—the pleasant novelist who assumes
the masculine pen-name of ‘ George Egerton ’ —in
its midst. The interesting writer is the lionised
guest of Mrs. William Smith, out St. Kilda way,
at present. At least, she was lionised till some-
thing like appendicitis put her on the sick-list,
causing a general upsetting of programmes all
round. She had to put off her trip to the Durbar,
and cable for her parent (Colonel Fox-Strangways)
to join her here. The lady is to be married early
next year to the much-medalled General Bruce
Hamilton.
“The death of Mrs. Parker, cabled irorti India
last week, was a shock. Mrs. Parker was the
younger daughter of coal-merchant Newbigin.
Mrs. Willie Robb was her sister, and was married
:a few years ago to an Englishman holding office
at Colombo. Not long ago Mrs. Parker spent a
few months in Melbourne with her parents. Then
she looked painfully thin, but was bright and
fluttersome. Her death was due to fever, and
was a sad blow to all her Melb. relatives.
“On Thursday of this week—all being well—
the marriage of politician Mackey and Miss Bates
comes off. The bachelor barrister reached the
forties before thinking of matrimony. A life of
hard graft has been crowned with success. Miss
Bates is a daughter of the late legislator Bates.
•Barrister Mackey is one of the staunchest de-
fenders of the Marshall Hall coterie in Melbourne.
“ Society mustered in force at the Marsliall-Hall
tootle. Among the frockiest was Mrs. Walter
Coldham, who had tricked forth her blond chub-
biness in a subdued blend of black and white—the
muslin being spotted, and keeping company with
a smart toque, in which black and white also
mingled. ■ Mrs. Peterson mothered her brood
in an artistic turn - out of biscuit and
black. Conspicuous among the fashionable
flutterers was the figure of Miss Carrie Moore,
in her hot pink and cerise garb and a summer-
house hat. Mr. George Lauri sat in grim silence
beside her, listening to the classic numbers and
watching, without a smile, the flaws and hitches
in the amateurs’ stage business. Herr Carl
Pinschoff was polished up to an eye-smaj;ting
point.
“Ballarat scores all the time with wonders.
The top-notcher to-date is Kathleen Meagan, who
has passed with honors the final teacher’s exam,
at the age of 13. All Ballarat is breathless over

PERSONAL ITEMS.
A simple transposition. Not E. W. 0.
Sullivan, but O. W. E. Sullivan.
The late Judge Moorhead of Westralia
was only 39 years old when he died. He was the
youngest Judge in Australasia.
David Syme never says “my paper,” but
always, with his cold and impressive tiger-smile,
“ the policy of the Age is so and so.”
Earl Beauchamp has made the remarkable
statement to a big London meeting that, while, he
was Governor of N".S. W., he never heard anything
of religious or sectarian quarrels !
Thus Q. Leg. Councillor H’Annear, in a
fine rhetorical outburst lately : —“ Can the
Hethiopian change his skin or the leopard his
spots?” Barlow, M.L.C. : “Of course he can.
He can change from one spot to another.”
Minister O’Sullivan points out, in a letter
to Sydney D.T., that the See Govt, consists of
eight Protestants and two Catholios. He might
have classified further : Two Catholics, two more-
or-less Orangemen, and six other Protestants.
Worth noting that the strongest and most
courageous denunciations of the sectarian move-
ment in N.S.W. have come from Presbyterian
parsons—Rev. Kinghorn, at Bathurst, and Rev.
Burgess, at Kiama (where the Ghost was raised).
Mr. Henry Gullett, now “well above
the world ” and somewhat tired of work, va-
cates the editorship of Sydney Daily Telegraph
early next year in favor of his old D.T. comrade,
Mr. Fred Ward, now on the literary staff of
Melbourne Argus.
Selina Sangal, whose death-sentence has
been commuted by the Vic. Executive to “im-
prisonment for life,” will probably be liberated at
the age of 50. A life-sentence in Victoria means
20 years, good conduct reduces it to 15 years.
Prisoner is now 35 years of age.
Cardinal Moran “has brought with him two
pikes dug from graves at Slievenamon (Ireland).
They will figure among the curios in the hall at
St. Mary’s. The weapons are said to have done
work in ’9B. ” Pity that Irish pikes, or grievances,
of ’9B should be dug up for Australia.
Mayor Cohen, of Adelaide, has gone to
India, but will not get as far as the Delhi Durbar.
He feels unspeakably hurt because “the First
Magistrate of the oldest municipality in Aus-
tralia”—meaning himself—has not been made a
Lord Mayor and a Right Honorably, l .
Noted that, at Sydney May Aral election,
the R.C. aldermen voted in a body for R.C.
Hughes, though, in one or two cases, that in-
volved going back on previous public professions
in favor of a new Mayor each year. The secta-
rian virus is working in many directions.
MAX HIRSCH,
The Freetrade and Single-tax Rattle-tin.
Said that astronomer John Tebbutt, of
Windsor (N.S.W.), lately advised his friends that
the drought would break in December. This,
too, before any of the recent rains, and in face of
the period of dryness and the general contradiction
that hangs on to the Wragge-Russell calculations.
In Adelaide University Medioal School a
girl is at the top of the first class in the fifth year,
while in the third year two girls are bracketed
top in the first class, anc(_ they are followed by
another girl. Miss Mayo, who takes the scholar-
ship in the final year, is a grand-daughter of Dr.
Mayo, one of Adelaide’s original settlers.
There was once in Victoria an Education
Minister who spelled “ recommend” with one
“m ” and “until ” with two “l’s.” He is dead.
But Railway-Minister Bent is still alive. He
wrote, t’other day, in a departmental minute :
“I have read this. It is virtually admitted what
Jennings and Cullen says.—T. Bent.”
Judge Pring’s foolish pronouncement
on the rights of free speech has eaused it to
be remarked that when N.S.W. gets a Judge who
has been a political hack she gets sometimes too
much politics ; when she picks a man who is not a
political hack she gets one who doesn’t know the
merest outlines of political history.
J. A. Andrews, perhaps the most skilled
man in “ political philosophy” that the Australian
Labor movement has known, is very seriously ill
of phthisis in Melbourne Hospital, and his friends
are striving to secure for him a retreat in a sana-
torium. Andrews, an anarchist of the William
Morris type, is a most talented man. to whom
Australian Radicalism owes much.
Henry LaWson who, since his return to
Australia, has suffered much from ill-health and
worry, fell over the cliffs at Manly (Sydney) last
week. Like Horace, he can claim to be surely
under the protection of the Muses, for a fall which
would kill most men only inflicted on him com-
paratively slight injuries (including a broken
ankle), from which he is now recovering.
Duncan Gillies, who is slowly recovering
from his knock-down attack of nephritis—-he has
evidently been more or less badly troubled in that
direction since assuming the Vic. Speakership
suffered from kidney-disease before he went to
London as Agent-General 12 or 13 years ago. The
veteran —the only Vic. public man who has made
politics alone pay as a business for 40 years is
built of tough material.
Westralian Government imports an Eng-
lish barrister to fill one of the vacancies on its
Supreme Court Bench. Excepting that the
Government need not have looked farther than
Melbourne or Sydney, the expedient of going
outside the State for a Judge was in this case
justified. There is so much wild-cat jealousy
among W.A. lawyers that the Bench much needs
strengthening from the outside.
Sydney D.T. humor. It is a P.D.A. yarn
that Messrs. E. W. Owe’Sullivan and ex-pugilist
Larry Foley are the Govt, of N. S.W. Now, Mr.
L. Foley is not exactly a social light, even if Mr.
O’Sullivan is. But the D.T., in chronicling the
“distinguished people” who went to meet Cardinal
Moran on his return to Sydney, started the list
with Messrs. O’Sullivan and L. Foley: then
followed M’s.L.C., gaud Mayors, Consuls and
other trash.
Premier Barton has his flashes. One on
the Orontes case:
Some of my critics—Mr. Reid among them —seem to be
surprised that the Government is not prepared to treat
the law as a dead letter. While, however, the provision
remains on the statute book, it will be given effect to.
If Mr. Reid wishes the plain intentions of Parliament to
be over-ridden by any administrative act of the Minister,
he must wait until he gets into office. I notice that Mr.
Reid is more astonished to-day than he was yesterday.
The less he reads the Act the more astonished he seems
to get.
Much speculation exists in Brisbane legal
circles re Mr. Justice Cooper’s continuance on the
Supreme Court Bench. Mr. Cooper, although a
sound lawyer, is also a man of pleasure, and the
profession marvel at his remaining on the Bench
when he might be (he has private means) spend-
ing a handsome pension on the glittering con-
tinong. Those claiming to be in the know allege
that he holds office simply to keep Attorney-
General Rutledge from jumping the judicial
Bench.
Resuming his seat on the Bench, t’other
day, after a year’s holiday, Victorian Judge Hood
remarked that though, while abroad, he had seen
wonderful things and met men who had im-
mensely impressed him, he had brought back
the conviction that there was no place like home,
and no pleasure like ivork. And shortly there-
after he ordered that two 13-year-old lads, sen-
tenced to a month’sgaol forassault, should receive
each a whipping of 10 strokes at the hands of the
hangman.
A recent Argus item:—“The Lord
Mayor of Melbourne continues to receive congra-
tulations on the honor which has been bestowed
upon him. Letters were received yesterday from
Sir John Madden, Vice-Admiral Sir Lewis Beau-
mont, and Sir Thomas Fitzgerald.” ihe accept-
ance of a title entails an awful obligation upon
the “honored” person. He has to congratulate
the local recipient of each and every new bauble
as it comes along. He enrolls himself in the
humorless fraternity of back-scratchers.
Judge Pring, whose extraordinary state-
ments about freedom of speech and sedition
have not excited much comment in N.S.W., is a
lawyer of great narrow ability, but of a curiously
hermit-like type. At school, at the University,
at the Bar (where he was very strong on “ pleas ”)
Mr. Pring kept aloof from the everyday life of the
world; outside of law his mental ideas are pro-
bably of the Heydonian type in fashion
during the Middle Ages. In one degenerate
respect only is Mr. Pring human*—he smokes
while reading briefs.
“Typ.” re the Murray typewriting tele-
graph machine: —
In a recent issue your London correspondent said that
Donald Murray had taken no partners in the invention.
This may be so now. In the early '9o’s I frequently looked
in at a boarding-house in Phillip-street, Sydney—the
haunt of a number of journalists. There I first heard of
an invention that two pressmen were engaged on. They
were optimists, and threatened the world with a type-
writing telegraph. The originator of the idea was
Fraser, who represented the M.L. press in Australia.
Murray, who had come from Maoriland, joined him in
working the idea out. There must be some Sydney
pressmen who remember the little tin den of a workshop
the inventors sweated in. A dispute arose between the
partners. I had lost sight of both invention and inventors
till I dropped on your par.
Charles Brookfield, in his reminiscences,
describes R. L. Stevenson’s costume:
His hair was parted in the middle, and fell beyond the
collar of his coat. He wore a black flannel shirt, with a
curious knitted tie twisted in a knot; he had Wellington
boots, rather tight, dark trousers, a pea-jacket and a
white sombrerb (an imitation perhaps of the headgear then
worn by his eminent friend, W. E. Henley). But the
most astonishing item in his attire was a lady’s sealskin
cape that he wore* about his shoulders,, fastened at the
neck by a fancy brooch, which also held together a bunch
of daffodils.
That, barring the daffodils, was approximately the
rig in whioh R.L.S. once turned up at The Bul-
letin office to deliver a letter hehad written about
affairs at Molokai.
One of the jwkes of the “ Birthday honors ”
list was the C.M.G.-ship given to Mr.
Frederick Dudley North, of Westralia.
Mr. North (a member of the Lord
North clan) held the positions of
private secretary and brother-in-
law to Bigjohn Forrest, with
such distinction'that the latter
created his office and his two
or three clerks into a “De-
partment ” in order that
brother - in - law Freddy
might rank as an under-
sec. There was a skir-
mish in Parliament
over the salary every
time the estimates
came up, but raged
the heathen Opposi-
tion never so furious-
ly, not a cent was
touched. When Big-
john went into
Federal politics Mr.
North’s position was
shaky, but he hung on
till another under-secre-
taryship became vacant,
when the Government
merged his toy depart-
ment into the larger one,
and he became head of
the amalgamated de-
partment over tlfe heads
of all his senior under-
secretaries. In recom-
pense for these arduous
labors, in hanging on to
his various sinecures,
and perhaps in compen-
sation for the nasty remarks made in Parliament
each year, comes the C.M.G.-ship. But Parlia-
ment got home in the end, for the estimates came
up a few days after the bauble was announced,
and W. A. Assembly cold-bloodedly cut £5O off
Mr. North’s salary. The joke was fittingly
wound up by a series of facetious letters in a
Perth daily, suggesting various celebrities for
similar honor, amongst them being the city
bellman.
Ex-president of N.S.W. Trades and
Labor Council O’Sullivan is completely lost in
Works Minister Owe’Sullivan, or Premier John
See’s declaration that, if he had the military
behind him as well as the police, he would break
the law to admit to N.S.W. the contract-laborers
from the Orontes would have been followed by the
Owe’Sullivan’s resignation. The See Government
is just now on the down-grade, and a very good
one to be out of ; to have gone out of it on trades-
union grounds would have been the Minister of
Works’ bold and straight way to a future Premier-
ship.
A Maoriland election surprise was H. D.
Bedford, who topped the Dunedin poll with
10,000 votes. He is only 25 years of age. He
lately stood for Caversham, but didn’t score more
than 140 votes. This young politician has the
gift of the gab, and paralysed his audience with
strings of unheard-of phrases. But the most
marvellous thing of all was George Fisher’s
re-election. George has been politically dead,
having been thrown over by Seddon. Nobody
gave him a ghost of a chance ; the Opposition
wouldn’t adopt him, and he took n > toil in the
campaign. Yet Fisher is back in Pa-.lament as
member for Wellington, and the politically dead
is alive again, and no one knows how it happened.
Since his return from England, Bigjohn
Forrest has adopted the Imperial—haw—custom
and refuses to interview pressmen personally,
giving all information through Secretary of De-
fence Collins. When John first assumed office
under the Commonwealth, he tried the old
Westralian bluster, but was pulled up with
a round turn when a pressman accepted his
bullying remark that the Commonwealth troops
could do “well enough with Martini-Henries,”
and sent it all round Australia as a Ministerial
E renouncement. Next day, John tumbled over
imself asserting that he “only spoke in a
jocular sense, and never meant,” etc., etc. After
that he used to invite the press into his sanctum
for whisky. But he has now evidently forgotten
his first lesson.
Obit. : Geo. Green, of Campbell’s Creek
(Vic.). He was one of the party sent out by the
British Govt, to the Arctic in 1851-2 on board the
Resolute in search of Sir John Franklin.
The petition for the release of Lieut.
Witton, of the Bushveldt Carbineers, secured
80,000 signatures in the Commonwealth. It goes
to King Edward, through Gov. Gen. Tennyson,
and will, according to all accounts, have to fight
against strong influence from the War Office.
On the 18th inst. Minister Bent’s
“ scouts ” cheoked tickets at Richmond (Melb.)
From the 8.30 a.m. train from Brighton seven
men were caught travelling on old tickets, or
going first-class on second tickets, or with no
tickets at all. Of these seven, five wore Panama
hats.
AN INSPIRATION.
’ARRIET : “ Say, Liz, wouldn’t Tie make a lovely
tram accident !”
Many people will be interested to ltwi-n
that Eileen, only daughter of that most entertain-
ing of conversationalists, Dr. Pafc Moloney,
formerly of Melbourne, was recently married in
London to Mr. J. P. Boland, M.P., barrister-at-
law.
Queensland Supreme Court has confirmed
the verdict of murder against Patrick Kenniff
and (Judge Real dissenting) against James
Kenniff. The Government can hardly hang
the latter, in view of Mr. Real’s strongly-
expressed opinion that there was no evidence
against him. If one juryman out of 12 can acquit
a man, certainly one Judge out of four should be
able to do so. Appeal to the Privy Council is
talked of.
Inclement Wragge, the Queensland storm
Baptist, lately lecturing at Melb. Athenaeum, was
asked to give his impression as to the probability
of the termination of the drought. Wragge
got nervous and broke it gently to the
audience that he was not the Almighty. “ Still
I have every reason,” he said, “to believe that
the drought will at last gradually give way,
though I don’t expect any sudden break-up.” A
remark which should in no way endanger his
reputation as a prophet.
Some finishing remarks of a windy Melb.
Arcus article on Retrenchment in the Education
Department
In these hard times the State cannot afford to teach
fancy subjects to boys and girls who would be much
better employed acquiring agricultural knowledge or
receiving domestic training.
Good old “Teach them something useful” again !
Same article suggests that children under six and
over 13 should be charged certain fees, the idea
being apparently the opening move in a Tory
game for the abolition of free education. The
Argus’ notion of education seems to be very simi-
lar to that of an old-time S. Vic. landholder, who
used to declare with much squattocratic emphasis
“We will never have good servants until these
State schools are abolished.”
Few candidates have struck a worse snag
at a general election than Parson Isitt, the Maori-
land prohibition apostle. The prohibitionists
scored a colossal vote, but the cold disgust with
which they didn’t give it to Parson Isitt is shown
below. The rev. expounder nominated for ten
different seats, and fell in this wise :

successful candidate, and only in one ease did he
get anywhere near half.

The recent precious downpour has spread
much joy along its course over the parched and
hungry western lands. Towns like Cobar,
Nynmgee, and White Cliffs, whence the bread-
winner had long since gone south in search of a
crust for wife and kids, are now rejoicing at the
home-coming of Dad. After the late rains
upwards of 200 wires passed through Cobar office
bidding the wanderers return, and the following
night saw arrive a duplicated train full of toilers—
the like of which had long been unfamiliar to the
Cobar residents.

A slight fresh in the Balonne, t’other
night, trickled down past St. George (Q.) and
sent the residents frantic with excitement. They
hadn’t seen running water for two years, and ran
out with lanterns, bottled-candles and slush-
lamps to gaze on the novelty, and to compare the
feel and the gurgle of it with waters they had
known in the long-ago.

From White Cliffs (N.S.W.) :
Our troubles as far as water is concerned are at an end,
158 points of rain having filled all our tanks. Bread has
again given out, but flour-laden camel-trains are only 20
miles away. On Friday, after the rain, our chief trader
took a brood of ducks, 15 months old, out of the yard in
which they had been reared, and drove them to his tank,
now full. They positively refused to enter it, so one
was caught and thrown in. It scrambled out in fear and
scooted up the bank, and. with its companions, has since
refused to take to the water at any price. They had
never seen more than a dishful for drinking.

Up North, the frogs are leaving the water-
holes for higher ground, and the Castlereagh River
blacks predict flood-rains. The nigs point out (1)
that frogs’ lives often depend on rain, and they
ought to know something about it; (2) that frogs
never reside in running streams, which wash them
along involuntarily, sometimes even into the
Murray, where codfish have their abode ; (3) that
frogs have a rooted objection to being eaten by
Murray cod, and so their present exodus.

“ Cuss” on an outback water-trouble :
Looks very much as if N.S.W. Govt, were determined to
cut off all connection between the far north-west of the
State and Broken Hill and Adelaide—the natural sources
of our supplies and outlets for stock. For 9or 10 months
of last year, and the earlier part of this, not a drop of
water was to be had for travelling stock between Onepah
waterhole., near the border, and Pack-Saddle bore, a
distance of 131 miles. At Oonooroo, 12 miles out from
Tibooburra, after years of appeal, Govt, at last put down
a bore at the junction of two stock routes, and a splendid
supply was struck. Apropos, the lofty official who had
to report on the necessity of the work, informed the
Minister that the bore was not needed, as there was a
permanent waterhole close by— whereas said hole was
8 or 10 miles distant on another stock-route, and
did not, at the best, hold more than a couple of
months’ supply. Early this year it was officially-
reported to Mr. O’Sullivan that pumping machinery
had been erected, and was doing; satisfactory work.
This was pure fancy, as, although costly machinery has
been for nearly two years lying out in the open, rust-
mo. to pieces close to the bore, there has been none
erected and so there have perished thousands of sheep
that could have been moved in time to save them had
the plant been erected. Meanwhile, swagsmen and
travellers of all sorts keep lettingdown jam-tins, &c., &c.,
on wire that they pull out of the fences and the result
is that it will soon be profitable to work the hole as a tin-
mine and rubbish-heap. ■

Despite, perhaps, the worst season on
record, in many parts of the State, the Victorian
man on the land has this year been exporting
many products with great vigor. In 10 months
he sent away 3,163, 000 pairs rabbits —in 1901 the
total for same period was just over 2,000,000 pairs ;
malt, 252,000 bushels,'against 100,000 in 1901, and
21,000 in 1900; maize, 239,000 centals, against
42,000; bran, 108,000 centals, against 40,000;
onions, 12,000 tons, against 5000; hay, straw,
chaff, 233,000 tons, against 104,000; potatoes,
20,000 tons, against 8000; jams and jellies,
6,7L1,0001b., against 2,506,0001 b.; cheese, 490,000113.,
against 214.000. There was also a substantial in-
crease in wine, biscuits, brandy, frozen mutton,
but a heavy slump in wheat, butter, and wool.
The rabbit-kill in Victoria this year will
be at least 30,000,000. The export of carcases
frozen will account for about 7,000,000 ; rabbit
skins about 12,000,000 ; then there are the canned
hosts to count in, and the enormous slaughter by
man and beast all over the State.

“Cliass” : Re ’possums turning carnivo-
rous (B. 6/12/8):
Those Yarnagulla (Vic.) people have probably mistaken
for a ’possum an animal wither closely resembling- one,
but smaller, sharper-snouted, and without the ’possum s
nakedness on under-side of tail. The animal is pretty
common in Vic. coastal districts, is of nocturnal habit,
and feeds chiefly on small birds. One once got into the
ceiling of my house, and, while “in residence,” killed
over 100 chickens—as many as 13 one night. Shot it at
last. Its scientific name is Phasquagale.
Alex. M. : “ Chass’s ” description applies well
to Phascologale penicillata (well known as the
“bush rat”), a marsupial closely allied to Dasyu-
rus (the “native cat”), and excelling even the
latter as a poultry-slayer.

Sept., and Oct.
Several pelicans
will lay in the
same nest, 12
or 14 eggs being
sometimes
found together.
The bird uses
her capacious
bill - pouch to
transport the
young from the
breeding-place to
the general fish-
ing-grounds, and
also to convey
food and water to
them from a dis-
tance. Only in
good seasons, how-
ever, does the peli-
can breed, and it is
hard'to find the eggs.
Also, when the nest is
found, the bird, suspect-
ing danger, will remove
tlio eggs in her pouch to another suitable spot.

“ Jack C.” deals with “ Trotter’s ” grue-
some yarn about the Mallee (8., 22/11/’02):
“Trotter” has drawn largely upon his imagination. I
have lived in the Mallee eight years, and well know most
of the northern country, and I say that all that stuff
about people wearing clothes made out of bags, and eat-
ing boiled wheat, is pure rot. Anybody should know
that if a man has wheat, he can easily get flour made of
it; besides, it is harder to get wheat this year than any-
thing else. “Trotter” didn’t happen to think of that.
Again, as to people eating lean rabbits—there are no lean
rabbits here.
* » * •
The starved-out Mallee cockie, making
coastwards with his family, is a curious traveller.
Sometimes he attains to a horse and cart, the
latter bearing epitaphs, mottoes, &c., such as
“Good-bye to Birchip,” “The Dead Finish,” and
“ Boigbeat to Beulah Land.” Other settlers, un-
able to rise above a perambulator or wheelbarrow,
turn horse themselves (in some cases for 200 miles)
if a goat can’t be had. Others are bogus circuses,
got up for taking-in soft folks, but they seldom
pass for the genuine article, whose identity is all
its own.
“ Cecil Poole ” : A man up Gunnedah way
told me that a neighbor had ceased to believe in
God because he could not think that, if He existed,
He would inflict such agonies on His dumb
creatures. “But,” said my informant to him,
“God didn’t put the stock there—we did. The
Almighty put kangaroos, wallabys, etc., on the
land and they could find a living.” Good common
sense ! The man who overstocks only practises,
on a vastly greater scale, the cruelty that lashes
an exhausted horse. Read lately that the Sahara
now carries nine millions of sheep—presumably
in natural and artificial oases. The French are
making the desert fertile; we are doing the
reverse. Shouldn’t be surprised if the N.S.W.
desert should shortly import wool and mutton
from its North African rival. It certainly will,
if we don’t cease asking God or the Govt, for
what we can get for ourselves.
NO HURRY—WAITING FOR REV. MIL
CUFF’S IDEA OF “ GOD’S GOOD TIME .”
“ Rev. W. Ouff, of England, also delivered an eloquent
and impressive address. He remarked that if God would
entrust to him the management of the clouds he would
see that every man in the north-west got wet. He appre-
hended that that would bethe very best way of meeting
the difficulty. At the same time he had faith and
that in good time He would pour the blessing of rain on
these parcheff areas."
Some of the more progressive Vic. pro-
fessional mendicaniswwß nowworking the woes of
the Mallee with satisfactory results. “I ’ad seven
’undred acres larst year, mum, but this ’ere drout
has broke me right up ! Could y’ spare a cove a
bob ter get a bit of tucker?” One of them was
gaoled recently for imposition. He was dressed
for the part correctly, even to carrying a whip ;
and, with a glib yarn about all the ’orses and land
he had lost, was meeting with much sympathy
and coin. It, of course, turned out at the trial
that all the land he ever owned was sticking on
him; and now even that will be compulsorily
flooded off him for “ three months.”

Concerning a certain offered wager ;
It is a peculiarity of many hap-hazard writers like
“ F.H.” (“Slinks,” 8., 29/11/’O2) that, when driven into
their last ditch, they “ talk money.” “ F.H.” sticks to
only one of his contradictions, i.e., the number of slinks
sent to Melbourne in a week. His offer to bet £5 that
700 calves “ of 401 b. weight” are not sent in a day or a
week to Melbourne from any one station Is ridiculous.
I never said they were all 40U>b. weight. I said that 700
dead calves, many just that weight, most not more than
a week old, were forwarded. If “ F.H.” will kindly
amend his wager to cover the original dispute I shall be
glad to deal with him.—F.R.
For months after
the Darling and other
of Australia’s occa-
sional rivers cease to
run, water drains into
the deeper holes; and
so, as a rule, even in
a drought, the river
townships can go on
drawing, without seri-
ously lowering their
own particular pools.
During November,
though, it was noted
that the drain from
the banks practically
ceased, and at Wil-
cannia and Bourke
other pools higher up
had to be tapped.

“ T.D.” : The
prevalent idea that
it is extremely un-
healthy to live on
swamp lands is dis-
credited by the re-
cords of the settled
Moe, Carrum and
Kooweerup swamps
in Vic. Typhoid and
zymotic disease s
generally are practi-
cally unknown, and
the swamp - dweller
only catches a cold
when he spends a
day or two on dry
hill country or goes
up to the metropolis
on a deputation
grumble.

“ E.M.P.” : Fail
to see anything re-
markable about Up-
Hill Creek and Lime-
stone Creek (8.,
15/11/’O2) being U
miles apart and run-
ninff different ways. The head waters of tlieGlenelg
and of the Wannon in one plane are only \ mile
apart, and one river was turned into the other tor
the benefit of a sawmill some years ago. h urther :
The comb of the roof at the courthouse at Ravenna
/'Ohio U.S. A.) divides the drops of rain, those that tall on
the south side lo the Gulf of Mexico, and those on the
opposite side to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, so that a mere
breath of air or the flutter of a bird’s wing may determine
their destination.
“ Waif” : In Victoria
there is a bird that sings at
night a song very like that
of the nightingale on a
small scale. I have heard
it at Eltham and at Charl-
ton between 9 and 11
o’clock. The song has not
the variety, liquidity,
volume, or “full-throated
ease” of the nightingale’s,
but it closely resembles the
first few tentative staves
that Philomel sings before
daylight. It has, also, the
nightingale song’s pecu-
liarity of now and again
faltering and ceasing ab-
ruptly as though the singer
were astonished at its own
presumption in serenading
the stars. Strange to say,
no one I have inquired of
knew anything of this bird,
i Natural, perhaps, that
people who love to have a squeaking “joey ” in a
cage should be deaf to less insistent songsters.
[ls “Waif” a new-chum who has heard the
“ magpie ” warble on moonlight nights ?]

“F.S.” re milking-machine question
I am told that the machine in use at Hawkesbury
(N.S.W.) Agricultural College is the Scotcli-Yankee in-
vention that has proved so modified a success in western
Vic. Anyhow, Mr. O’Oallaghan, Principal Suter’s col-
league visited this (west. Vic.) district a lew months ago,
where the machines seemed to be working satisfactorily,
and said he would advise their use on his return to
N.S.W. It is since then that the faults I mentioned
have been discovered, and no doubt Mr. Suter will find
them out sooner or later. Most of Mr. Suter s report is
correct, but he will have to modify each of these three
statements : “ Maximum results are obtained, the
cows do not show the-slightest uneasiness,” and the
machines are an “ exact imitation of the sucking of a
calf.” The results, when cows in the full flush of milk
are concerned, are here, at any rate, by no means the
“ maximum.” The cows Bhow great uneasiness, owing
to the milk surging up and back against the teats, which
causes the cows to hold up their milk. For this and
other reasons it does not imitate the sucking of the calf.
A conclusive proof of all this is that five dairymen near
me have hung up their machines and reverted to hand-
milking : and that the firm that introduced them recog-
nises the machine’s defects, and is busv trying to improve
the mechanism.

Australian saltbush, which has been
studied and propagated in California for 20 years,
has proved so satisfactory that settlers on the dry
western slope are now sowing large areas and
keeping stock on country that was formerly barren
and useless in drought time. On Paso Robles
sub-station, during a drought in 1899, it was re-
ported, “there was no green fodder plant to be
found anywhere, with the sole exception of the
Baltbush imported from Australia. It is in
many places cultivated as a regular fodder crop.
“One-fifth of an acre,” says Prof. Hilgard, “sown
m Dec., yielded 1001 b. of seed. This plot wu cut
in Sept., and, cured for fodder, yielded at the
rate of 5| tons per acre. Three such cuttings
were practicable during tho driest season known.
This will be a revelation to most Australians, who
have never thought of economising with this
valuable indigenous plant.

WATSON’S WHISKY.
“H.S.R.”: What “Spinifex” (8.,
29/ll’02) describes as the bandicoot is the paddy -
melon, sometimes called the wirra and strike-a-
light. It belongs to the wallaby family, but does
not live in mobs. No dog, by the way, will eat
bandicoot, raw or cooked, though it is considered
18-carat by bush epicures.
* * * •
“ Singler ’’ ; The bandicoot (“Spinifex,”
8., 29/ll’02) does not hop; it runs on all four
legs. By-the-way, when quail-shooting, if your
pointer comes across a “ bandy,” good-bye to the
quail until the latter is slain. The bandy is much
found amongst prickly-pear, and is very hard to
catch.
* • * •
“Herne”: Much as I have been in the
bush, I have never known of a bandicoot hopping.
The bandicoot I’m acquainted with is slightly
smaller than the k. rat—bluish grey in color, with
a snout about 2in. long, short, stumpy ears, naked
3in. tail, and short legs—and it runs, not hops.
Of course, the Woolloomooloo bandicoot may be
of a different species.

“ Nardo ” on scrub-feeding :
“Walnie” (8., 6/12/’O2) writes that working bullocks
hold condition on scrub (mostly' what sheep won’t eat).
As this is news to anyone who has had the handling of
stock, it would he useful to know the name of these
scrubs. Sheep, if dry, will fatten on mulga, and on
mixed scrubs such as exist at “ Meryula ” (not plenty of
mulga, as “ Walnie ” states) they keep condition ; hut my
own long experience in "scrubbing” cattle and sheep
has taught me that mulga and kurrajong are the only
scrubs that cal tie will thrive on. On the inferior scrubs
sheep will live well and cattle will starve to wretched-
ness. Mulga is certainly worth cultivation, as “ Walnie ”
states, and so is kurrajong, but to the private owner the
process is prohibition. God knows no one hankers after
an eternal existence on the western lands, and scrub-cul-
tivation—to say the least—means a good long look into
eternity.

“ Nymsie ” : “ Werrimee ” (B. 6/12/’O2),
merely repeats a too-readily-accepted traditional
notion that our Australian snipe breeds entirely
in Japan. Now, in ’B9 two young snipe that
could barely flutter, were shot on the Buckland,
near Eurobin, Vic. Yet no has for so far
announced the finding of snipe eggs within the
Commonwealth. “Werrimee” says: “Though
the snipe was described as long ago as 1801, no
nests or eggs were discovered until 1897, princi-
pally on account of the bird's migratory habits,
and from the fact that the Japs take little interest
in natural history.” Yet no artists in the world
can more graphically than the Japs depict the
whole tribe of long-legged, long-billed birds.

“A.W.R.”: Re music effect on dogs—
here is a curious fact. At Waiau (M.L.) once, a
concert was held in aid of the local Presbyterian
Church fund. Waiau is in the Wool King
district, so numerous sheep-dogs were outside the
hall; and every time squatter Low sang (all
Scotch songs) the dogs joined in—after their
fashion ; a compliment they paid to no other per-
former. It was thought that possibly the Scottish
heredity of the canines had something to do with
the matter.

“Prooshan” re sheep-mortality :
At VVagga railway-gates, recently, were lying dead 123
sheep out of a comparatively small lot. A policeman
told the drover that he’d give him two hours to shift the
carcases, and the man had to pay 3d. a head and give
the pelts in to get them removed. Another man gave £5
and pelts to get 500 throats cut near Wagga. I saw 2000
hone-bags pass Oourabyra yesterday. Drover said: “I
paid £lO for 6 acres for a night at Gumly', £8 for 8 acres
at Borambola, and £lO for same at Tarcutta. I struck
first grass at Nack’s, near Adelong; then ‘ scouring ’
settled 49 the first night, and 54 next day, and they’re
dropping in dozens now. Wonder if I’ll be able to deliver
ant of ’em 1 **

Queer question asked recently in Q. Leg.
Assembly, and answer thereto :
PHOTOGRAPHS OF ABORIGINALS.
Mr. J. Hamilton asked the Home Secretary—Did the
Southern protector of aborigines inform him that some
gins, whose photographs were sent by Dr. Roth to the
Home Secretary in order to show how well they were
cared for, were dead at the time said photographs were
so sent ?
Mr. Foxton replied : Yes.
“ Saltpetre ” : An old whaler in
Chillagoe (Q.) district pointed out to me,
t’other night, that, on observing the reflec-
tion of the waxing moon in a mirror, a
distinct image will be seen for every day
of her agG. That is, on (say) tno fiftii
night, there will be one bright image and
four fainter. To date I have observed
eight, and begin to wonder how my small
glass is going to accommodate, say, 20!
Perhaps some scientist among Bulletin
readers will elucidate. (N.B.—No snake-
inice in the case.)

Who would be a Maori candidate 1
One of him, standing for a Southern con-
stituency, spoke for two hours, and then
inquired if any gentleman would ask
any questions. Several gentlemen did, and
they kept the candidate going for four and
three-quarter hours-after that. The meet-
ing finally gave up through sheer exhaus-
tion at 2.30 a.m. on a wet, foggy morning
with all the pubs, closed.

“Herne” : Re rabbits (“Bobrid,”
8., 30/10/’O2). In N.E. Vic. we trap all
the year round, and any old does caught
now have from four to eight young. I ra P"
ping keeps bunny moving; hence the land-
owners’ growing objection to it, as they find
previously uninfested parts with rabbits on,
after trappers have exploited the thick
places. When a rabbit is caught and
squeals others always run up and attack
the victim, but they soon spot something
wrong and clear out. Here we find the
burning of logs and digging out of bur-
rows is the best way to get rid of
them.

“ Eiddal ” : Amber-cane seed, of
which there is precious little available, is
quoted at £BO a ton in Victoria, and, even at that,
a quarter of the weight consists of fluff, husks,
&c. Much of the wheat sold nowadays lacks the
thorough cleaning which used to be given by
hand-winnowing. The automatic harvester soon
pays for itself with the debris it smuggles into the
bags!

An object-lesson in irrigation :
N. A. Gatenby, owner of Jemalong station, on the
Lachlan, 20 miles below Forbes (N.S.W.), is now well
through an interesting test, under the eye of a practical
man nominated by N.S.W. Govt. Jemalong is, among
western squattages, about the most striking object-lesson
in irrigation; and Mr. Gatenby seized the present
droughty time to show more widely, under test condi-
tions, what his hobby can do. His undertaking was to
fatten 1650 sheep on 22 acres of irrigated lucerne, keeping
them for four months. A patch sft. x 3ft. is cut per
sheep daily; this allows a month between cuttings.
After going for nearly 3 months there is such a stack of
lucerne-hay on hand that it is probable the number of
sheep per acre might safely have been fixed at from 90 to
100, instead of at 75. For an ordinary hay crop Mr.
Gatenby gives two waterings ; and this year he reckons
that the ss. per acre, which this cost, has given him a
return of over £lO. Mr. Gatenby was prepared to wager
that he could keep 15,000 sheep on 200 acres during the
whole summer.

A Gippsland cookie, named Fortune, fell

paper :—“A few months ago I found a nest of

“ Prospector ” : On the cliffs
overhanging the Wollombi River,
N.S.W., I have often seen rock
wallaby scamper up a leaning tree
as quickly as a “ possum,” and hop
from limb to limb as nimbly as a
lyre-bird. At mid-day I have
seen as many as 30 camping in
one tree. When disturbed they
will jump as much as 30ft. to
the ground, and hop away all right.

Heard in a Riverina pub. :
“ Which room shall I show this
gentleman to, mama?” “Which
gentleman, my dear ? ” “ Oh, the

cheque, that has been shearing
at Pomingalarna.” “ Oh. show
him to No. 9, next to Mary’s
room.” Two days later: “ Where

“ Which fellow, my dear ? ” “ Oh,

that Quiet Jimmy 4 rooked.’ ”
“Oh, give him a soojee-bag, and
let him sleep on the wood-heap.”

Dering Grateleigh : The “naked shoulder ” and
“ warm limb ” variety of verse is in limited journalistic
demand. Readers like it, but it makes the pious sweater
and the bloated and pimply, but moral, publican with-
draw their advts. The Bulletin is a strictly commercial
enterprise ; you’ve no idea how many good advts. about
adulterated rum and diseased meat at 4d. a lb. we have
lost by publishing poems like yours... .Lilli-Pilli: (1) As
for See and co. “ having no real sympathy with the
Labor Party,” that is true enough ; but a dog has to bark
for his boss, and so Premier John See is something of a
reform politician now. (2) The Bulletin, in a way,
“sticks to” the N.S.W. State Labor Party because it
thinks there is some hope in that Party ; there is no hope
in any other. (3) On the Law-Byers issue, the whole
question was Orangeism on one side and Labor on the
other, and when there is a contest—on the one side
sectarianism, Papism or Orangeism, and on the other side
anything at all, eve.n Toryism—The Bulletin would
plump for that anything. There is nothing—absolutely
and most assuredly nothing—from which there is more
to be feared by a young nation than clerical domination.
....G.W. : “Pantoum” has good ideas, but is too long.
If all that repetition is “a song in the Malay manner ”
the Malay editor must have lots of space to fill up....
H.F. : Do cease harping on the advantages of “ untrained
troops,” as shown by the case of the “ untrained Boer ” !
The Boer held his own for nearly three years against
stupendous odds because he was one of the best-trained
soldiers in the world. He had learned to shoot, and had
devised an excellent system of mobilisation and
transport; while the Britisher neglected useful
training, and spent his time standing up in beauti-
ful straight rows on a parade-ground—and being
yelled at by an aged and stereotyped officer
Bob F. : If the parson really made that joke about the
lady parishioner’s legs, he was a very precipitous parson.
....A.W. : As you don’t give member’s name or station-
master’s name, we decline to insert in our “fair and
impartial paper.” If we libel a man, we at least want to
know whom we are libelling.... H.O.T.K. : Poem of 47
verses about John regretfully declined... .M.H.G.: Death
rates are for last year: Queensland, 11,910 per million
inhabitants ; Australia (including Tasmania), 12,180;
England, 18,400; London, 18,800 Austen C. : Un-
relieved horror... .S.M. :B. R. Wise “wiped the floor”
with J. Carrulhers over the Friedman case ; and you
would admit it but for the fact that (evidently) you don’t
form your own opinions, but take ’em slop-made from
Sydney D.T. It is as easy to recognise the “ slop” article
in opinions as in clothes.. ..A.M.H.G. : Substance of
your argument: it is dangerous to give the State power
over neglected children because the power might be
abused. On same grounds all power ought to be taken
away from the State... .Kuklux : Bulletin can’t enthuse
over the Pope’s medal to Barton. Possibly it wasn’t
intended that way, but it has proved rather like the
small boy’s present of a tin to the dog’s tail.. ..J.L.K. :
“Rub.” for print... .Yellamo : Damned by the clumsy
self-complacence of the first few lines C.C. : The
Queensland State finances are in too horrid a mess to
encourage a change of Govt. What sane man would
(especially under existing State electoral conditions)
deliberately take on the task of adjusting the finances?
Y.S.Y. : Flat as pancakes.., .V.H. :As you say, it is
very late ; also, it rather smacks of malice... .P. Brandt:
The fact that it has been set to music by Prince So-and-So
marks it as unfit for our purpose. We only print—at
least we try only to print—original'llnpublished verse....
A.P.R, : All acceptable.... Alan (S.A.): Nicely-written—
so nicely written that we really' ought to like it. Suitable
for a little kiddies’ paper, or a paper for enthusiastic
matrons. Bulletin isn’t quite a matrons’ paper, and it
isn’t a little kiddies’ paper : little kiddies haven’t got
sixpence... .H.P. :He is an outside contributor to this
paper, without any special commission from it. ..M.W.P.:
We strongly advise you to consult the Brisbane doctor
whose name is written on the memo, upon your returned
letter A.E.CJ.: You have bruised the Muse consider
ably ; it would be more manly' to assault the wood-heap.
Ethel: We begin to think that Ethel is a name almost
as unlucky as Julia.. ..G.B. : The law of poetry is that
the merit of a poem is in inverse ratio to the height of the
poet’s collars. Your collars must be 900 ft. high, but we
can see your ears in your poem H.T. : Are you a
Paisley body? G.R. 2 Smooth, undistinguished
P.E. : You have just found out that cockatoo rhymes
with kangaroo, and your universe is a-whirl. Poor
wretch 1 H.W.K.: Some wild bush merit..—
Robert G. : “On the Rim ” has “ go,” and the rockiness
of its metre might be overlooked but for the thing’s air
of criminal squalor. Bad. business to apotheosize people
who “ touch-up drunks in Little Bourke.”... .Bohemian :
The Cardinal’s paper denounces Tub Bulletin as
heretical, and the Bill Mackyites denounce it as Papisti-
cal. As a matter of fact, this paper is at heart
bigotedly Mahometan Toujours : We don’t know
to whom the lady is married ; nor do we know who (if
anybody) is the gentleman’s wife. We steer clear of
dogmatising on theatrical relationships—that sort
of thing is far too intricate and costs too much
money N.O.F.F. : One bears distinct signs of
not being original, and the others might have been
written anywhere. Send us something with the mark of
Australia... .0.C.8. : Why shouldn’t all Customs cases
be heard in open court? If a poor servant-girl makes a
little mistake she has to go to open court. Why should
a rich importer be privileged to privately pay £lOOO fine
for robbing the State and go on dining at the same table
as honest men ? We are not speaking of bona-fide
mistakes. Minister Kingston does not, we are sure,
desire to wrong any man. Tell us of one “ dishonest
action ”he has done for his own benefit.... Adonis We
never try to read obviously illegible MS. Bad copy is not
a sign of cleverness ; all the men (with one solitary
exception) whose regular contributions are welcome here
write very legibly indeed.... Will Kannia : Unrelieved
gloom, and we are trying just now to dodge that sort of
thing. At least we are dodging other people’s gloom ,
our own we nurture tenderly Revert: There are not
so many employment avenues open to women that the
community can afford to abolish barmaids in that offhand
and airy fashion. Nor is it, in this paper’s opinion, desi-
rable that barmaids should be abolished. Most barmaids
employed in decent hotels are of decent character, and a
woman runs less risk in serving behind a hotel bar than
in acting as chambermaid (at a third of the pay) in a
coffee-palace Adolphus : You send us “ Annabel Lee”
as an original contribution. Thanks ! Next time, try
us with “The Raven” or “The Rubaiyat.”

Napoleon is dead... J.L.: Query, how many bushels did
Carthage yield to the acre ? There seems much legend

fewer words: the British seaman was plentiful enough
when life at sea, bad as it was, was still about as good as
life on shore. Now it isn’t nearly as good, and the British

they would lose their money.... Dan Delew : First verse

Yugi: That religious paper item is a Bulletin par. very
badly re-written T.H.E. (Barcaldine): The term
appears in the Bible (First Samuel, chapter 4, verse 21) :
“ And she named the child Ichabod, saying ‘ The glory is
departed from Israel.’”....E.J. : May use “In the
Steerage... .G.S. : “Two o’clock train” only fit for

long letters (or any unnecessary letters) with MSS. All
that is needed is writer’s name and address written on the

gruesome subject needed more artistic handling. ..
Graeme Dhu : Mere empty jingle.... .Susanna : Too
ornate and pretentious in style; with more simplicity
you might do good work.... Jorian : Yery patchy and
broken-winded verse... .The Real M‘K. : Not ill-written,

“With a revenue from amusement-tickets, coupled with a tax on the totalisator, they would be able to raise £120,000 a year, a sum that would make the charities independent of Government aid. With regard to the totilisator, however, he found the religions party

POLITICAL
POINTS
For .South Balmain's next election —“ We
want Justice, not Law.”
It’s not the jury that we should rally to
defend, but the Liberty of the People—not the
form but the essence.
The defection of Sid. Law from N.S.W.
Labor party is merely the dropping off by gravi-
tation of a pendulous political tumor.
The present game of Australian Capitalism
and the* daily press-signs of it are to be seen
everywhere—is to divide and conquer the Labor
party by the sectarian issue.
Mr. Holman, N.S. Wales M.P., writing to
Sydney D.T., confesses that his Parliamentary
correspondence averages 120 letters per week.
What slavery for less than 20s. a day !
An Edinburgh Review writer commends
the objection of the Greater Britains to let “the
Delilah of militarism bind their limbs and shear
their locks,” and deliver them over to the —
Empire.
Westralia’s Upper House has rejected the
Shops and Factories Bill and the Bill for the
amendment of the Constitution, so there is little
left of the democratic programme over which
Premier James has been toiling.
Sid. Law, the returned Labor rat, objects
to "solidarity.” Wonderful how soon his liquid
Laborism crystallised into a seat on the i 'ront
Opposition benches—where he becomes the slave
of a caucus dictated by outsiders. Yerily the last
state of that man is worse than the first.
DESIGN FOR AN AUSTRALIAN
CATHEDRAL WINDOW.
The Bishop in London begging for the funds.
Be the claim of those “ highly educa-
tional ” media, the Sydney dailies, to free carriage
by post, in the interest of education. All school
requisites pay as much as the trashiest publica-
tions. Postage on an ordinary text-book—such as
Meiklejohn’s “ English language is Bd.
Trouble in N.S.W. as to the alleged abuse
of franked envelopes by a State member (to dis-
tribute municipal election literature), impresses
again the lesson that all such special privileges to
politicians should be abolished. Let the M.P.
receive a salary adequate to cover all expenses.
Some ardent-Roman Catholics seem to
.it v. t> i. • tit a ti. i
think that because the Labor Party m N.S.W. has
• 6 . J ec .t a malignant attack by the
Dill-Mackyites it will consequently be forced into
their arms. But the Party should have more
sense than that, abjuring sectarianism in anv
f orm a
t, „
Rev. Dill-Macky at Balmain (N.S.W.) :
The Protestant Defence Association was more of a
political than a religious movement. It was not con-
nected with any party. Their grand plank was Pro-
testantism, and they were not going to voce for anv man
who was not a Protestant or who sat with one leg on
either side of the rail e
. ~ , ,
Uiearly, them the association is not one for the
defence of Protestants, but for the boycotting
of Roman Catholics from public life.
Q. Assembly has just passed a Local
Government Act. No change of any importance
embodied therein, beyond a little provision to
prevent ratepayers who are not also owners vot-
ing on a question of loan. This step will be a Big
block to municipal progress in Queensland.
“ What is the meaning of this ? ” exclaim
the Six Hatters, peering over the steamer’s
taffrail. “The meaning of it,” replies the Little
Boy of Manly, “ is that my county is going to
be a Free and Independent Nation, and govern
itself for the benefit of its own citizens.”
If Barton insists on his increased-naval-
subsidy and preferential-tariff-to-England pro-
posals and forces them on his party, he and they
will go to down flat, and Reid will reap where
he has not sown. Reid is nicely posed on the
fence, as usual. He objects to the proposals and
will fight them, but he is “ open to be convinced.”
What nonsense was shrieked by Mr.
Pilcher and other members of the Upper House
in N.S.W. as to the terrible crime of barring
“British subjects” out of Sydney! The main
purpose of the Australian Aliens Immigration
Restriction Act is to keep British subjects from
Australia—British subjects from India and China.
Mr. S. J. Law, who contested the Balmain
South (N.S.W.) bye-election on a platform of
militant Orangeism under the aegis of Rev. Dill-
Macky, secured at the polls a substantial R.C.
vote —that of contractors and their friends who
object to the day-labor system on Govt, works
championed by the Labor Party. Money talks
everywhere when public interest is dumb.
In a very tired, perfunctory sort of way
Premier See has introduced in N.S.W. Assembly,
almost at the end of a slow, dead-weary session,
that Bill for the reduction of members which, at
election time, whirled like an oriftamme in the
forefront of the Ministerial programme. Now it
lags miserably at the tail instead of the front, and
Mr. See’s own supporters laughed at the pretence
that its introduction means anything.
That splendid example of the blessings of
Private Enterprise, the Tasmanian Great Western
Railway syndicate, which has for seven years or
more always been just on the verge of beginning
to build its line, wants another six months exten-
sion of time in which to start operations! The
syndicate is now in London trying to select
a suitable pick and shovel, and if it can find the
kind of pick and shovel it wants it is really going
to begin.
A significant point in connection with
Balmain (N.S.W.) by-election was the presence
of the Federal .Labor members, not only from
N.S.W., but from the neighboring States also, at
the meetings of the Labor candidate. At present
the Labor party is alone in having a continuity of
thought and purpose throughout the whole Com-
monwealth. Probably, if the Federal members in
N.S.W. lent a hand to support a Seeite or anti-
Seeite, there would be a howl about “Federal
interference in State affairs.” But the Labor
party and the 'Labor voters see the absurdity of
that.
This comes from the very far North, and
is written by a man who knows his way about in
those regions:—
I have been assured, confidentially, that the authori-
ties here have been instructed to allow pearl-shellers to
bring in aliens in contravention o t the A.R. Act. When
once here there is no law to deport these aliens, and
bonds are as piecrust when an unwilling Government has
to enforce them ; so the concession is practically opening
the back door of Australia to aliens. A man who cuts a
very big figure in pearling some time ago assured my in-
formant that those chiefly concerned intended “doing as
they do in America —scatter the dollars ” —to gain their
ends. From latest developments the dollars are evidently
getting very effective down South.
Sydney daily papers (even the Star,
usually limping dismally in the rear of the
procession) are carefully preparing for the next
Federal and State elections by a series of “fakes”
—the fodder-duties fake, the Friedman-case fake,
the Orontes hatters fake, the “general Federal
tyranny ” fake, which is resurrected once a week
on some fresh pretext. The sane, democratic,
national view of politics (which, it is needless to
explain, would not involve a support of either See
or Barton, though it would abjure fakes) never
finds a voice. At the bidding of the press, fake
issues, and fake issues only, make up N.S.W.
politics.
P.M.G. Drake’s warm reception by his
constituents in the Q. metropolis and South
Brisbane —the hotbeds of commercialism and dis-
content with the Australian Govt. —hascompletely
demoralised the Codrier. That demented organ
has described Drake as the “weakling of the
Cabinet,” “a bungler,” and many other more or
less cheerful articles; but since the P.M.G.’s
arrival in Q., and the exhibition of his manifest
popularity, the leaden morning daily has retired
into an obscure corner to ruminate. Drake has
wisely attached himself to his old democratic
supporters, and “Billy” Browne, leader of the
Labor Opposition, moved a vote of confidence in
his one-time colleague.
Apropos N. S. W. J ustice Pring’s declaration
in the Griffith libel-case that it was the duty of
every citizen to cease criticising the merits of a
war when once it had been embarked upon by the
Government, months after the Crimean War had
been begun John Bright said in the House of
Commons: — ’
I am not, nor did I ever pretend, to be a statesman ;
and that character is so tainted and so equivocal in our
day, that I am not sure that a pure and honorable
ambition would aspire to it. I have not enjoyed for 30
years, like these noble lords, the honors and emoluments
of office. I have not set my sails to every passing breeze.
I am a plain and simple citizen, sent here by one of the
foremost constituencies of the Empire, representing
feebly, perhaps, but honestly, I do aver, the opinions of
very many, and the true interests of all those who have
sent me here. Let it not be said that I am alone in my
condemnation of this war, and of this incapable and
guilty administration. And even if I were alone, if mine
were a solitary voice, raised amid the din of arms and the
clamor of a venal press, I should have the consolation I
have to-night—and which I trust will be mine to the last
moment of my existence —the priceless consolation that
no word of mine has tended to promote the squandering
of my country’s treasure, or the spilling of one single
drop of my country’s blood.
S.A. workers should never forget the
shameless way in which the Advertiser,
S’langdon Bonython’s erstwhile de-
mocratic daily, has turned dog.
When Premier Jenkins went
back on liberalism, the ’Tiser,
which 'crawled to Kingston
when that virile and pro-
gressive democrat was in
power, went with him.
Bonython’s paper has
been foremost in
advocating the con-
scienceless Trans-
Australian land-
grant railway-grab,
and maintains an
eloquent silence re-
specting all its
former democratic
principles. The only
democratic local
sheet now remain-
ing is the Herald,
the Ilabor organ.
Remarkable
question on the
notice paper of
N.S.W. Assembly :
Dr. Ross to ask the
Chief Secretary—
(l) When a N.S.W.
citizen offers a newly-
stamped letter to be
weighed at the post
office, and the same is
a mere fraction over-
weight, does the postal
official allow for the moisture
on the stamp ?
(2) Or does he let the stamp
dry and then weigh the letter
again ?
(3) Does he pharge postage on the weight of the stamp?
(4) If he does, will the Chief Secretary call upon the
Federal Postmaster-General to instruct the postal officials
to immediately cease this outrage ?
(5) Failing that, will he secede from the Commonwealth
immediately, and throw Dawes Point overboard, and
proceed to break things generally ?
The above notice hasn’t actually appeared yet,
but it, or something like it, may be expected any
day.
Edwards, M.H.R. for Oxley (Q.), was
recently banqueted by his Brisbane admirers, and
the Courier, on the morning after the guzzle,
devoted a leader to bubbling eulogy of said
personage, whom it represented as a statesman of
vast eloquence and ideas. Fact is that Mr.
Edwards’ only notable achievement in the Aus-
tralian Parliament was a long-dr,awn-out, unutter-
ably commonplace, and dismal defence of Kanaka
labor, consisting, for the most part, of excruciating
extracts from Brisbane Courier. When men like
Edwards come to be regarded as Australian
statesmen, the bulk of the population will be
bordering on barbarism or imbecility.
Probably the N.S. W. land and stock
owners who are making the State pay for carrying
their fodder are the same people who have been
making it pay for carrying also their workmen.
The State, through the Labor Dept., used to
advance railway-tickets “to assist necessitous
workmen to reach employment ” ; but the Com-
missioners report that this system, “in process of
time, developed very largely into a State assist-
ance to employers, by which t. ey and their agents
transfer their own proper and legitimate risks and
expenses to the backs of the people at large.”
And most often it is that sort of employer who
talks loudest about “sturdy independence.”
Mr. Sam. Hordern returns from a trip to
Europe with the news that the policy of the
Australian Government is creating a very bad
opinion of us in England. Probably it is also
creating a rather bad opinion of us in Sheol.
Certainly in a country like England, where 80 per
.cent, of the wealth is owned by per cent, of the
people—-a count) yof immense landlords, with an
Established Church, a peasantry that is most
respectful to the squire, a hereditary House of
Lords, a Freetrade policy, a large collection of
Sam. Horderns, and a profound belief that the
world was meant to be exploited by Englishmen
with the aid of nigger labor, some of the Federal
legislation must seem rather shocking.
“ Geebung”: Be Ernest Favenc on a
territorial question (B. 29/11/’O2). Finney’s ‘‘ His-
tory of the Australian Colonies, ” a book compiled
by the authority of the N.S. W. Education Dept.,
presumably from official records, says, on page
The close of 1859 saw the boundaries of N.S.W. fixed as
they remain up to the present year (1899).
Further on, on same page :
In 1863 all the Northern Territory between 129° and
188° E. longitude, which, since the establishment of
Queensland, had remained unattached to any colony,
was transferred to South Australia. The remaining
3deg. between 138th and 141st meridian E. long, were
given to Queensland. The boundaries of the Australian
colonies, thus fixed in 1863, have not since been altered.
This, although not proof that N.S.W. consented
to the transfer, seems to me to imply that she
must have consented to the decision, and proba-
bly gave up all claim to this land in 1859, when
her-present boundaries were fixed.
“ Wirra Warra,” re Ernest Favenc on “A
Territorial Question ” (B. 29/10/’02):
Present accepted boundaries appear in S.A. Act, 23 of
1863, but, so far as I can gather, there has been no aban-
donment or renunciation by N.S.W. of the land bounded
by long. 135° E. and 138° E., lat. 256° and the sea on the
North. The ownership of that land was clearly with
N.S.W. previous to 1863, and was given by “Letters
Patent” to S.A., seemingly without any reference to
N.S.W. Whether those “Letters Patent,” signed by
Queen Victoria in the 27th year of her reign, are legal, is
the question. For many years, Vic. and S.A. have been
battling over the ownership of a strip about two miles
wide by 240 miles long on their common boundary, which
land fs not a whit per acre more valuable than-the land
mentioned above. It may be somewhat late to start an
agitation for revision of the boundaries, as S.A. has the
“ nine points,” but the possession is worth a struggle on
the part of N:S.W. The Act 23 of 1863 stands, as far as I
can find, without any alterations—there are some other
points in it on which you can enlarge, and thereby
disseminate a knowledge which is almost lost in the misty
ages past.

deference to this feeling that the proceedings were not
reported, as they were recorded, verbatim.
Let us see—what was that cablegram about which
Mr,.-Barton was explaining so much and so often
lately?
Brisbane Courier is the centre of a gaudy
political row in Queensland. Minister Dalrymple
says that that paper wrote to him, stating that
it was going to issue a special series of articles
about the agricultural position on the Darling
Downs, and asking for £lOO worth of extra adver-
rising—apparently to help cover the cost. Dal-
rymple says that two days after his refusal the
Courier started to denounce him as a most
incompetent Minister. The Courier’s defence is
that it called him an incompetent Minister before
the refusal of the £lOO as well as after. It seems
to The Bulletin that both parries are missing the
point. The real question is: What would the
ou^j®. I ‘ havfi called Dalrymple if he had gjanted

ice the now celebrated six-hatters’imported-
contract-labor case, Mr. Hawken, M.L.C., moved
the adjournment of N.S.W. Leg. Council to
“protest against the prevention of the landing
°f six Englishmen.” “ Six Hinglishmen ! ” Un-
deed! As if a cheap-contract Hinglishman could
n °t be as poisonous an enemy of the Australian
workman as a cheap Dago or a cheap Dutchman.
The anti-national party in this country will have
reason to clearly understand that the Aus-
tralian anti-contract-labor law was enacted with a
view to its being enforced every time, that it is
an anti-slavery law, for the upholding of which.

ANOTHER VICTORY FOR
VITADATIO
Oatnpaspe, (Vic.)
. 24th August, 1901.
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
184 PitLstreet, Sydney.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in giving m.y testimony
to the good quality and curing' power of Webber’s
VITADATIO. Some two years agol was taken ill ; one
doctor said it was Whooping Oough. I was in bed for
over a month, and got weaker ancl weaker until I went
to another doctor, who said it was Hydatids on the
Liver. The doctors ordered me to go under an opera-
tion, but I did not care to for fear of chloroform, and on
the next day when my mother was reading the paper,
she came across a testimonial from a person who had
been cured of a similar trouble to my own with VITADA-
TIO, so I said I would try some myself. I sent for a few
bottles at once, and commenced taking it, and I never
felt better than I am to-day, and do honestly believe that
I would have been dead long ago had I not resorted to
VITADATIO. I have taken ten bottles in all. I am
increasing in weight every month, and feel it is a
pleasure to be alive. I was waiting to see my cure was
lasting before sending you a testimonial, and will be
pleased to give information to anyone at any time. You
may publish this as you think fit.
Yours, tryly,
(Signed) ISABEL M. WASON,
Campaspe.

Eehuca (Vic.) Shire Council started re-
trenching lately. It knocked 7 per cent, off the
secretary and engineer’s salary and abolished the
dairy-inspector altogether. Then it reckoned it
had done a good day’s work. Retrenchment
mostly means dispensing with dairy-inspectors,
health officers and cleanliness.
The waxed Judge Madden’s knowledge of
the criminal law seems slightly hazy for a man in
such a position. T’other day he had got well
under way with the trial of an aborigine before
the under-sheriff drew his attention to the fact
that the whole proceedings were illegal, accused
not having been provided with counsel, as was
compulsory in a trial for misdemeanor. Later on
the same day he awarded seven years to another
aborigine for larceny, and then had to call prisoner
back and explain to him that the law only
allowed the Judge to give five years—which he
had much pleasure in bestowing.
The Hotel Australia has recently put on the
Sydney market a new whisky—Cardhu whisky—pro-
nounced by all who have tried it to be something too

A Clean Factory.— lt has been said that
you would have to go a long way to find a
cigarette, or any other kind of factory, which is
cleaner or more airy than Ogden’s, Ltd., of
“ Guinea Gold Cigarette ” fame. To use an old
expression, “You could eat your dinner on the
floor.” *
The Rosewarne Packing Co. do their canning
at Camperdown, but they kill and chill in the districts
where the sheep and cattle are grown. The 00. employs
300 men ; gets through 2,000 sheep a day, that is 12,000
cans. A special Government inspector is on the works,
to see that the animals are healthy when they are killed,
and the canning 'process is a far more effectual means
of cooking than is the ordinary method. The Co. advise
that once a tin of meat is opened, the contents should be
emptied into an earthen vessel, and not allowed to
remain in the tin. The Co. does a tremendous business
all over Australia and Tasmania.*
Among the most brilliant of Sydney Christmas
displays is that of the Gold and Silversmiths' Alliance, 90
King-st., the business of which concern has so rapidly
increased that its show-rooms now occupy an area of
nearly 800 sq.-feet. Only personal inspection could give
an adequate idea of the magnitude and variety of the
stock, and it must here be sufficient to say that, in
watches, in diamond and other jewellery, in silverware,
leather nic-nackery, clocks, and optical goods, the set-out
is certainly—as claimed by the firm—“one of the most
magnificent out of London.
“Kodak Limited,” 284 Collins-st., Melbourne,
have now for sale a developing-machine, whieh entirely
dispenses with the need for a dark-room in kodak-photo-
graphy, so that anybody can now load and unload the
camera, and develop and finish the film-negatives by day-
light. “ The machine consists of a metal box, into which
the exposed spool is placed. A few turns of the handle
unwinds the black paper covering of the film. The de-
velpper is now poured in, and the turning of the handle
continued until the negatives are developed. Fixing and
washing are carried out in the same easy manner.”
The latest development of the Norddeutscher-
Lloyd Co.’s vigorously go-ahead policy is the institution
of a special steam service between Sydney and Singapore.
Two new 3500-ton steamers will begin running about
June, 1903. The vessels are being buiit specially to meet
tropical needs ; the cabins being unusually large, light
and airy, and the promenade decks extra wide and
roomy, with a wooden awning deck overhead. Ventila-
tion will be aided throughout by electric fans, and there
will be refrigerating chambers for cargo and provisions.
The passenger accommodation will be for 30 first class,
40 second, and 25 third.*

Biliousness.
Not only is the liver the largest and one of
the most important organs in the human body,
but when deranged it becomes the source of
endless suffering. When the liver is clogged by
the inactivity of the kidneys and bowels, it
becomes torpid and fails to filter the bile from
the blood, thus producing biliousness and a
general impairment of the digestive system.
The tongue is coated, the head aches, digestion
is irpperfect; there is aching of the limbs and
back, feelings of fullness, weight and soreness
over the stomach and liver; the eye becomes
yellow and jaundiced and the complexion muddy,
and urine is scanty and highly colored, and the
bowels irregular, constipation and looseness
alternating. There is little use of treating the
liver separately, as it can never be set right
until the kidneys and bowels are made active
in removing the waste matter from the body.
It is for this very reason that Db. Mouse's
Indian Root Pills have always proved so
wonderfully successful in curing the most chronic
cases of liver complaint, biliousness, and com-
plicated ailments of the kidneys, liver and
bowels. Put up in amber bottles and the full
name blown thereon.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“ Glenara ”: Mahonga, Vic. champion high-
jumper (credited with 6ft. Bin. at Sale), has some curious
ways. For the first round the horse will generally con-
descend to be led out by the attendants, the jockey
sitting passive on him ; but next time he will follow
nobody but the jockey, who has to dismount and lead
him. Later on, his stable companions, lolanthe and
Tribune, have to be brought out for company. Fre-
quently he stands motionless, with rump presented to the
jump, for 10 or 15 min., despite continual patting and
coaxing, ere doing a lightning wheel and going in a suc-
cession of football bounces for the sticks —and over.
Sometimes the jock, has to remain on the ground until
his wayward mount turns, and then be flung into the
saddle! Very different is the behaviour of Mahonga’s
principal rival, the 14-year-old Magic, who can be relied
on to make an opponent go to 6ft. to win, and does his
skipping with the cool cleverness of the finished artist.
No foolish reefing and plunging about him.

Queensland Derby ended Balfour, Ivan, and
Nimbus, the same order as in the Queensland Guineas in
Nov. Balfour is by Little Bernie from Trent Rose, by
Trenton from Guelder Rose, by Kingston (imp.) ; is full
brother to Coronation, Master Bernie and Master Darley,
and is owned by the Hon. H. Mosnian, who races in
N.S.W., M.L., and Q.
* * * •
Spite of his easy appropriation of Q. Derby,
Balfour’s annexation of Queensland Cup was not, appar-
ently, expected. At card-call previous night at hundreds
to three, £5OO was available without takers. Balfour now
ranks with Wheatmeat, Petronel, and Fernando, who
each won the two big Q. plums at one meeting. Saturday
saw Balfour close on the Stanley Plate in a canter, and he
appears to be about the best prad Kanakaland has pro-
duced for years.
• * * *
Newcastle Tatt.’s Cup (Saturday), with at-
tendant Tatt.’s sweep, was as complete a boil-over as
could be imagined. Kalingo, Ryde, Mozeltaub, and
Devilment were heavily wagered upon as named, but
Inkstand, the rankest outsider of all, 14 to 1 (twenties for
the seeking) against, streaked away at the distance and
landed the coin six lengths better than Tatterdemalion,
another outsider. Inkstand is by Australian Cup winner
Navigator, from Dove ; he hadn’t at any time recently
shown anything to justify the notion that his prospects
of winning were even fair.
* • •
“ Tattersall’s ” unclaimed prizes now total about
£20,000. The bulk of this, nearly £13,000, represents
unclaimed money in sweeps drawn between May, 1901,
and May, 1902 ; the odd £6OOO has been in Tatt.’s hands
since 1899. These are Tas. Auditor-General’s figures, and
indicate that, in unclaimed prizes alone, Tatt.’s “working
capital ” averages over £lO,OOO a year—a sum which many
business firms would like to have “to play with.” Tas.
Auditor reports that every reasonable effort is being
made to find the winners ; but Tatt.’s officials complain
that the stoppage of letters addressed to “ Tattersall ” is
responsible for a good deal of the delay in paying the
money over. ,

Re Martini’s Rough Riders, now touring Queens-
land and billed to reach Mackay about Xmas, Mackay
Standard (l/12/’O2) says :—“ When the show arrives, some
of our local horsemen will have a chance to make a name
for themselves, as ‘ Dargan’s Grey,’ who, it is claimed, is
Australia’s champion bucking horse, is still uncon-
quered. At Brisbane the management offered £2 to any-
body who stuck to the saddle for two minutes, or a wager
of £5O that no one could ride the animal for five minutes."
Now, here is a soft snap, ye Aboriginaliars who rode
Dargan (on paper) to a standstill when he was in his
prime 1

Rosehill meet! Saturday, revealed a promising
two-year-old gelding in Wooton’s Lander. He rushed
through a field of 14 young ones, and finished six lengths
ahead of the second horse. Lander is by Grafton from
Zulander, a crack pony of her time.
* * * •
December Stakes, at Q.T.C. Spring meet, was
responsible for a mix-up that will take away considerably
from the year’s tote profits. First horse (Vulcano) home
was protested against by jock, on second nag, Lady Olaf,
and the objection upheld. Then owner of the third
(Kate) kicked against Lady Olaf, but consideration of this
was postponed. When Vulcano weighed-in, the weight-
flag was flown for some minutes, and “ books ” paid out.
A communication was sent to the tote man to pay Vul-
cano tickets. When the protest came these instructions
were countermanded, but the latter message reached its
destination first, with the result that nearly all the Vul-
cano money was handed over before the mistake became
known. The protest against Lady Olaf was dismissed,
and the Q.T.C. had no alternative but to pay the Lady
Olaf tickets, though stating it only did so as “ an act
of grace.” The blunder cost the machine at least £6OO,
and Ikey suffered considerably, too.
* • • *
A. J.O.’s choice of three stipendiary stewards at
a yearly screw of £5OO each paralysed Sydney turfdom.
Dozens of well-known broken-down punters, nag-owners,
trainers, touts, guns, and the like, who boasted heaps of
influence, were mentioned as “ certs.” Said to have been
130 applications. Good or bad, the N.S.W. governing
body did right in going as far from the scene of action as
possible. Probably that’s why metropolitan intriguers
were overlooked, spite of their big “ pulls.” Nearest to
Sydney’s crop of applicants is very little known Mr. J.
B. Withan, the reputed possessor of 50 years’ turf experi-
ence. Other two are Mr. A. W. Pearson (who has been a
steward at Epsom, Vic., for 12 years) and Mr. A. W.
Hutton, of Forbes (N.S.W.) district, where he has figured
as president, vice-president,' committeeman, secretary,
and handicapper of the local race club, and also raced
horses. The sooner the three get to business the better,
for things have gone from exceedingly bad to very much
worse. Cronk running is carried on now with the aggres-
sive cheek of highway robbery.

Mr. John Walker, aged 83, among the oldest of
M.L. sports, was burnt to death t’other day. At various
periods during his turf career he was jock., trainer,
owner and studmaster, and could point to having been up
on the first nag home in Wanganui Produce Stakes six
times successively.

Glebe (Sydney) butcher “Dick” Briant, who
died last week cetat 70, was once a forefront N.S.W. sport
and helped rowing and boxing liberally ; the former in
its best days, and the latter when Foley was at his top.

Winner (Recruit) of Club Handicap at Sydney
Trotting Club’s last meet, in three starts has won each
time. Was bred in Queensland, and, after being rejected
by War Office re-mount buyers, was bought in Sydney for
£B. His origin is unknown.

Nag Simile, that punters are freely nibbling at
for coming Summer Cup and will pounce upon greedily
directly his party or stable makes a move, is full brother to
St. Maclou, winner of recent Manchester November
Handicap, and who shaped so well in the Cesarewitch
Stakes. An offer of £5OOO for this prad was promptly
refused with the remark that that sum didn’t represent
half his price.

Died recently at his native town, Portland
(Vic.), Austral-Indian jockey Fred. Gibbs. He learned to
ride on Western district courses with W. T. Cawker,
Whitehead, and others, and afterwards drifted to India,
and won nearly everything worth winning, including
three Vioeroy’s Cups on Sprightly, Leonidas, and Cherry.
Phthisis sent him to England, and, later on, to a German
sanatorium in hopes of finding a cure, but the disease
killed him ere he had reached 35 years.

George Towns—who “hunted” Jake Gaudaur
five years, forced him to row at the point of the bayonet,
and dragged the championship out of his hands—was
champagned, as he deserved, in Sydney Town Hall t’other
day. But what a sick end sorry business has that
championship become I The average Australian cares no
more for it now than does the average Britisher for the
Diamond Sculls. The Continent was all vibrant when
Trickett won on the Thames. And who that saw it will
ever forget that day in Sydney when Beach first put
II an Van down on the Parramatta? There was more life
in it than in the departure of any contingent. Bars aflood
with liquor; voices rising, rising, rising, till the whole
city roared. Poor old bookie Ned Jones (girthed like an
alderman, and red as rnady clover then) sitting, like a
lord of Misrule, in his chamber over the gate of Trickett’s
old hotel, and yellow and black showing everywhere.
Sculling will hardly give us another day like that. For
good or bad it has gone down into the ruck of little
things.
* • •
Returned world’s premier sculler Towns taiks
of what it cost to wrest the championship from Gaudaur.
He was nearly five years trying to get the match on.
Stake money won, and £5O allowed by the Canuck for
expenses, totalled £3OO ; but the outlay, equipping him-
self and going to and from Rat Portage, was £265.
Consequently, all the champion got back with, in addi-
tion to the title, was £35 ; and yet we were told he made
a “ small fortune ’’ out of the race.

Captain “ J oe ” Darling goes back to his Tas-
manian farm, and away from cricket altogether. South
Australians had hopes of him playing with them; but the
Australian captain declined. It’s just as well Darling
refused, since opposing States would certainly have
objected to him playing with S.A., while his home and
family were in Tasmania.

Cricketer Bill Howell well-nigh put up a record
with the Australian XI. in S’Africa. Against Natal
XV. he took 11 wickets for 79 runs; and against
Western Province XI. scooped 8 for 31 and 9 for 31 —17
out of the possible 20 wickets for 64 runs.

The S.A. XT. to meet N.S.W. contains all the
familiar elements save Fred Jarvis ; also some interesting
experiments. Newiand, a young lawyer, is now S.A.’s
recognised wicketkeeper, and he is also a sound bat.
Waters is the new bowler, on his trial. Of the two who
lately made a record first-wicket stand, Gehrs, a colt, is
chosen, and Leak, of more experience, left. Dickenson,
emergency man, is a coming batsman. “ Better than I
am,” said one of the best of the eleven ; "and going to
be as good as Clem Hill."

The interference of “ big ” cricket with ordinary
first-grade club matches in Australia is rapidly approach-
ing the unbearable. For instance, all Sydney first-grade
engagements are suspended while about a dozen players
are playing inter-State games, and there are no first-
grade matches from Nov. to March, more than half the
season. First-grade matches are played on two consecu-
tive Saturdays, and very often, owing to a side “declar-
ing” or not having time to finish its innings, some of the
team do not get a strike during a match. One regular
member of the first XI. of Glebe (Sydney) electorate has
not had an innings yet. What chance does this system
give a young player to improve ?
* * •
Last match of Australian XI. (against a N.S.W.
XIII.) began at Sydney Cricket Ground, Friday, and
drew, perhaps, 5000 people. N.S.W. opened on a wicket
softened by recent rains, but which improved later.
Feature of first day’s batting was colt Hickson’s 68 not
out; he worked vigorously, and showed good judgment
in selecting balls to be pasted. Little more than a year
ago Hickson was a Church of England Grammar school-
boy. Others -of the XIII. to shape effectively were
Mackay and Diamond, who kept the wickets up
while they were at their worst. All “ came off” more or
less, bar Pye, Loveridge and M'Beth, who had “ eggs” for
their portion. Rural rep., J. R. Mackay, was in till 100
materialised, his accumulation being 37 for a little
over two hours of fine defence when most needed. Six of
seven Australians whacked bowling honors, Trumper,.
Saunders and Armstrong being best. Resumption Satur-
day saw 11,000 looking on. At stumps draw Australia
had made 191, and three N.S.W. wickets had gone for
111. Colt Howard was disastrous to the big combination,,
often beating the bat badly, and chances off him were
frequently missed. Ultimately he bagged 6 of 9 wickets
for 48. Duff (thrown out for 66) made much the best
stand for the XI. Aboriginal Marsh disappointed with
the ball; he sent down 14 oyers (one a maiden) and got
1 wicket for 44.
■ •
Australian XI. v. N.S.W. XIII. match con-
tinued Monday under a lowering sky. The 13 went out
for 214, setting the 11 251 to win, and, when stumps were
lifted, 185 of these had been secured with three wickets
still to fall. Cricket was slow to dreariness mainly
through deadliness of Saunders’ and Jones’ bowling,
which didn’t justify taking chances at all. Saunders
shaped excellently. In six of. his overs only six runs
were scored, and there wasn’t a loose one among
the lot. With figures at 137 Jones got up-country
crack Mackay’s wicket for 67 after 2h. 53mins.
Mackay’s defence was first-class, and his coolness
veteran-like. Jones’ trundling topped anything shown
by him in Sydney for years; he bagged 7 for 73 in an
Innings that lasted 41 hours. Saunders bowled well, but
had no luck, though he kept the runs low. Australians
batted brilliantly until Howard got at them again, and
stopped their gait materially. Trumper, at work lh.
27mins., accumulated 78, which embraced one 5 and nine
4’s ; he shaped right up to his very best form, and only
went out through making a terriffic straight drive at
M‘Beth’s second ball, which the latter caught and held
when most onlookers thought it had gone whistling into
space.
* * » *
One feature of the XI. v. XIII. crieket-matcb
was Captain Darling’s admirable placing of the field—the
right man in the right place every time. He allowed no
bowler to stay on while he was not trundling well, and
altogether justified himself—like English Captain
Maclaren—one of the best men Australia ever saw at the
helm.
* * • *
Cabled t’other day that, on the motion of
English county captains Maclaren and Jessop, “ only
three matches should be played with visiting Australian
teams, each match to have one week set aside for it.”
Which, though an excellent suggestion, seems hardly
likely to “ catch on ” with the gilded M.C.C. of England,
whose permission is necessary before it becomes a cricket
statute. Also suggested that the width of the wicket be
widened to nine inches instead of the hitherto eight
inches. One inch may not seem much to the uninitiated
spectator, but it means a good lot to a bowler, especially
on a pitch which “ bites ” a good deal. Batsmen, as a
rule, are against this latter proposed alteration, simply
because it may mean fewer runs, and consequently lower
averages; but the common-sense bowler agrees (he is
always agreeing when its suits him and not the batsman)
that it is an idea worthy of a good long trial.
* • * *
The pandering to cricketer Trumper is becoming
oppressive. Certainly he proved himself the best bats-
man during a season in England, and a “ straight " chap
all round ; still there are other members of the team who
assisted to win the rubber, but are left out in the cold-
all for the laudation of Trumper. Previous players have
deserved recognition—notably Captain Darling ; but the
whole thing seems to be a case of booming Trumper and
keeping up the jealousy which has for a long while dis-
graced the States of the Commonwealth.

Lord Hawke’s team of English cricketers
arrived t’other day at Auckland (M.L.), and begin a three-
days’ match against Auckland XI. to-morrow (Friday).
The tour consists of 16 matches with many picnics—being
a long rest after a hard cricket season in England. There
is every probability that a match will be arranged in
Sydney between the returning team and an Australian
XI. on 20th March, with perhaps a match in one of the
other States—Captain Hawke having signified that he
would like a few matches in Australia, if the M.L.
Cricket Association see fit to arrange them.

Flying Squadron championship of N.S.W. —
virtually State swimming club supremacy—contested
t’other day, resulted in a third successive triumph for
East Sydney, whose team of five averaged a shade over
1.4 J ; they traversed the full journey (,500yds.) in 5.22 3-6.
Nothing like this has ever before been done the world over,
and yet this quintette came from one club. Dick Cavill
(Pyrmont) and young South Sea Islander Wickham (East
Sydney) gave the time a big lift by swimming an almost
neck-and-neck race in the initial relay, and finishing with
Cavill two yards best, the watch showing 60 2-ssec. Pre-
vious record figures were East Sydney’s 5.26 2-5, last year.
• * * *
At Enterprise Swimming Club’s 18th annual
gala, in Farmer’s Domain baths, Sydney, 'Saturday, Dick
Cavill wiped out Lane’s world’s record (59 3-5 sec.) for ihe
“ hundred ’’ by 3-ssec. He could have done even better.
Cavill has a 68 3-5 performance for the distance, accom-
plished in England a few months since, but, because it
was done in a handicap, ’Ome swimming authorities
wouldn’t endorse the feat—and yet exactly similar con-
ditions attended last Saturday’s swim. Objection to
records made in handicaps is absurd, especially if a
narrow swimming basin is the scene, as the swimmer is
there hampered through the troubled water created
by those in front of him, or it coming back from
the basin’s sides. Cavill is in wonderfully fine form just
now and, provided his health sticks to him, may improve
still further, startling as the latest time is. Saturday
before, in the initial relay of the Flying Squadron supre-
macy, he put up 60 2-ssec. all out. This means that he
came on 1 2-5 sec. over 100yds. in. a single week 1
• * * •
Mile premiership of N.S.W. fell to Dick Cavill
last Saturday. The champion won as he liked, literally
playing with the opposition—going away and coming
back to them—and swimming side-stroke most of the
journey Second man, Hobbs (H.M.S. Katoomba) was
over 100 yards in the rear at the finish. Time (25min.
8 3-ssec.) is 4 4-ssec. better than the English best, and
could have been made considerably faster had the
swimmer gone away from the jump instead of loafing lap
after lap as he did. Indications are (despite the return
from England last week of Lane and Read) that all this
year’s State and Australasian championships will go
Cavill’s way.

Hottest “scraps ” imaginable were seen at Syd-
ney Gaiety A.C. last week, when a two-fight bill provided
battery in continuous heavy doses J Bantams Ted Murphy
(who recently quickly squelched Maorilander Craig) and
Ted Green fought like tiger-cats from go. In the fourth
round the thing was still either man’s—if anything, more
Murphy’s—but a heavy right on the mouth spread-eagled
him for 9 seconds, amid a howling uproar. Badly shaken,
Murphy stood up, to be downed again and again, the last
punch settling matters. Armor-plated negro Joe Walcott,
who thrives on punishment, opposed Paddy Harden, and
they put up a bitter and forceful struggle. Walcott
swung wildly and widely often, but occasionally made
heavy impacts. They stood toe to toe and gave thump
for thump, while the crowd rose on its hind-legs and
screeched. Both seemed to be winning in turn. They
floored, staggered, and shook each other up violently,
and old pug. followers marvelled at the durability
of the bruisers. Several times Walcott was all but
out, and on many occasions Harden was in a simi-
lar plight. Punches in the stomach made the black
squirm, but rights on the iron-encased head-piece only
brought a grin from ear to ear. There was no best in it
at the close of the seventh round, but the eighth was all
the son of Ham’s way, and he was top canine till the
tenth, when a fearful battering broke the white bruiser
completely, and his seconds gave it up.
* * * *
An invasion of this continent by ’Murkan out-
of-work bruisers attracted by the boom and the big
money available is looming ahead. Already one, Jack
Grace, is here ; but his credentials aren’t good enough to
make him marketable, although he has been fighting 13
years. Grace owns a badly-smashed left jaw, the work
of torpedo Billy Murphy, who, in ’92, got in a pile-driving
right, and had the Yankee anyhow in the second round,
when police interference prevented further breakages.
Not likely the new comer will get a big match unless he
shows well in ordinary week-night tussles. Others
reported as coming are Tom Tracey (foster brother of
Dan Creedon and white welter champion of the world),
“ Kid ” Williams, Jack Root, George Gardiner and ’Frisco
Thurston, the first to beat Otto Cribb. All these
well accredited pugs will be eagerly snapped up by scrap
■caterers, everyone of whom is on the alert to get in first.

Sydney National Sporting Club has matched
Billy M‘Gall and Dan Creedon for a £325 purse and a bet
df £2OO aside. They meet second Tuesday in February.
Claimed for Creedon—who, though still only 34, was
heavyweight top-matcher of England, and once looked
sure middleweight premier of the world but for bumping
against Bob Fitzsimmons—that he has improved con-
siderably on his previous Australian showing. Fight is
sure to induce heavier betting than anything for years,
as M'Call supporters are plentiful and sanguine, and
t’other party is just as confident. Poundage is about
equal, and the winner will have choice of Yankee Jim
Scanlan, “ Snowy ” Sturgeon, Peter Felix, or the better
of wood-chopper Heckenberg and Bananalander Booth
(who meet 29th inst.) for the next big bruise.
* * * *
Crack Sydney welter-weights ex-waterman
George Johns, and negro Tom Mitchell—met a second
time at Sydney Gaiety A.C., Monday night, for a £2OO
purse. Previously Johns won in three rounds through
the black maiming his left hand. House at latest battle,
though big, wasn’t within £5O of what the first fight
attracted. Tussle opened and continued vigorous, the
white forcing things mostly, though t’other had longer
reach and greater height if slightly less poundage. Both
men were clever, and the crowd cheered skilful evasions
of direful swings and left leads for stomach and
face that would have been fatal had they got home.
Mitchell was particularly clever in sheltering, his body
generally, and took many a heavy punch meant for the
point high up on an almost bald bullet-head that appeared
insensible to knocks. Both men showed signs of collapse,
but weathered the trouble and again came. Johns didn’t
show nearly as well as in the prior fight; he was trained
too light and couldn’t bring the power to bear. Neither
punished heavily at any time. In the 15th round they
were both weak. Johns jolted a quick left uppercut on
the chin, then swung the,right to the jaw (not over hard),
and, following up quickly, half-hit, half-poked another
right on the same spot, and Mitchell let himself be
counted out. After going to his hotel Mitchell fell ill,
and was the next morning removed to Sydney Hospital
suffering from concussion of the brain.

Queensland Full Court lately upheld the
decision of the P.M., fining a member of the
Queensland Rifles for neglecting to make himself
efficient under the regulations. This should have
a healthy effect on those who enlist for the sole
purpose of fetching “ the girls ” by their uniform
and swagger. But is it to be applied to officers ?
If so, what a stripping off of uniforms there will
be!
Petitions for the reprieve of the Kenniffs
are being circulated in Brisbane, and the total of
signatures is well over 6000. Funds to brief bar-
risters in the Kenniffs’ unsuccessful appeal to the
Full Court came from curiously divergent quarters.
The Western bush workers (round Roma, Mitchell,
and Cunnamulla) subscribed freely ; a Brisbane
merohant (Hebrew, at that) gave £25; one of
Rickards’ imported serio-comics sent £10; the
keeper of a “ two-up ” kip sent £5; and a certain
well-advertised lady of pleasure threw in
several pounds, with expressions of sympathy.
There was no solicitation for subscriptions;
all were voluntary. “Old man” Kenniff and
his condemned sons, Pat and Jim, own a
number of horses running loose round Mitchell,
which they have been unable to muster,
so |far. When the horses are collected and
sold there should be enough to pay all ex-
penses, but until then the prisoners are dependent
for their defence on the financial assistance of
friends and sympathisers.
Mr. Varney Parkes, ex-Crown Minister of
N.S.W., unsuccessfully sued for a divorce from
his wife last week; and she sued for a divorce
from him without success; net result, a great
heap of dirty linen exposed to the public, and a
big heap of costs. The most satisfactory point
of the suit is that alleged co-respondent Biller-
well was made liable for heavy costs, Billerwell
refused to repeat or deny on oath in court an
allegation of his adultery with Mrs. Parkes,
although he was said to have admitted
it to petitioner Parkes. The Judge thought
so little of Billerwell that he said he’d
have much pleasure in gaoling him for the
costs if he got the chance, and as Billerwell
is said to earn just now about £3 a-week (which
salary does not run to such luxuries as participa-
tion in divorce suits), he is probably feeling rather
uncomfortable. Justice Simpson, who presided,
commended the press for suppressing the names
of the three young women named as co-respondents
with Varney Parkes. At the same time, he recog-
nised that “it confused the public mind.” It is
open to argument whether there is an ultimate
gain by suppressing names. Usual result is that
rumor fastens suspicion of guilt on absolutely
innocent people.
The marrying habits of the Parkes
family—and the Parkes family has always married
a good deal—culminated recently in the appear-
ance of Varney Parkes in court, applying for a
divorce from his second wife, whom he accused of
misconduct with the usual co-respondent. Also
the second wife applied for a divorce from Varney.
And this curious state of things resulted: The law
decided that the charge against Varney was not
proved; that Mrs. Parkes did not commit adultery
with the co-respondent ; but (apparently) that the
co-respondent did commit adultery—at least the
law joyfully “slopped” the co-re. in costs and
other woes. In this respect the law (if it had got
its facts correctly, which is another matter) wasn’t
by any means the ass it looked. It seemed to think
that the co. said he committed adultery with Mrs.
Parkes ; while the lady certainly denied it. There
were some shreds of evidence only; but the
shreds plus his confession (if the confession was
proved) made a good enough case against the co-
respondent. On the other hand his confession or
alleged confession was no evidence against Mrs.
Parkes; if such things were allowed the writer
might confess any day that George Reid
had committed murder and high treason,
and thereby get George into great trouble; and
the evidence by itself wasn’t nearly enough to
prove anything against the lady. So the law gave
the co-respondent the benefit of his own state-
ments. The theory that Jones fought a duel with
Smith while Smith didn’t fight one with Jones;
or that Brown was present on a certain occasion
along with Ferguson, while on the same occasion
Ferguson was not present with Brown; or that
Tom and Bill were twin brothers to the limited
extent that Tom was a twin and Bill wasn’t, may
seem ridiculous in logic. Still there are times
when it makes much better law than can be made
out of propositions that look much better logic.

Shiels, Victoria’s croaking Treasurer, had
a lucid moment when be told a deputation,
composed mostly of goody-goody church-goers,,
who came to ask the State to keep the various
religious charities out of the insolvency court, that
they had better go and advocate the legalisation
of the “tote” with a percentage deduction for
charities. He said he was convinced that the only
way of raising enough funds for the charities was
by" an amusement-tax coupled with the “tote”
percentage deductions. The statement has caused
great excitement and the newspapers are crowded
with richly humorous letters taking Shiels to task
as a godless person and expressing opinions about
bis ultimate destiny. Shiels showed that with an
amusement and sports tax of a penny in the
shilling, and a tax on the “tote’’the charities
would be able to draw at the rate of £120,000 a
year from the section in the community best able
to pay it.

German administration in New Britain
seems marked by some brutality. A correspon-
dent to The Bulletin alleges that, last month,
10 Chinese mechanics were flogged publicly for
refusing to wortfcon the Govt, roads on Sunday.
An English newspaper announces as a new
discovery that thirst can be allayed by dipping
the clothing in salt water and putting it on with-
out wringing. Capt. Bligh practised this plan
successfully in his famous “mutiny of the Bounty”
open-boat voyage.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Wise, who has
been working very hard of late, takes a three
months’ holiday, on medical advice, as soon as
the State Parliament prorogues. He has just had
the satisfaction of hearing by cable that his law
opinion in the Sydney “French Club case” has
been upheld by the Privy Council. This relieves
him of a big personal liability which it was sought
to put upon him as a shareholder in the club, and
of a huge sum in costs.
Sydney Telegraph's special correspondent
sends some York stories from Borambil station,
in Forbes district, N.S.W., where the Duke went
shooting. A station-hand was sent into a swamp
to stir up ducks. “You’ll see the Duke on the
other side,” he was told. When he got out of the
swamp he saw an ordinary bloke on horseback
Lord Hopetoun :
“ I say,” said the man to him, “ where’s the bloomin’
Dook?” “Do you see that buffer over there in a brown
hat ? ” answered Lord Hopetoun, indicating another
horseman a little distance off. “Yes.” “Well, that 8
the Dook.” ....
A Lachlan professional man met a .majestic indi-
vidual, elaborately dressed, sauntering along with
a gun. He took him for a marquis at least,
offered him a seat in his buggy, and “ my-lorded
him liberally. He turned out to be trie valet 8
understudy, or something like that. But the
greatest sensation came on the day when the
Duke endeavored to run down Bill.
Bill was put on a fast horse, and detailed for duty as
leader of the party, being told to keep always about
200yds. ahead—a nice, respectful distance. Well, they
started out, Bill correctly in front. After they had gone
some distance, either the Duke or Lord Hopetoun wanted
to speak to Bill, and spurred his horse with the object of
coming up with him. Bill, perceiving that his 200yds.
were shortening, spurted. Too clearly, there was nothing
for it but to run Bill to earth. They gave chase, and,
although Royalty pursued Bill for about 10 miles, Bill
loyally kept his respectful distance of 200yds.

OGDEN’S, LIMITED, 45 York-street, Sydney.
London Spectator has been collecting
stories of clever children. The best to date is of a
fashionable little girl who wanted to play at
staying-at-home and having a “day.” “What is
a day ? ” said her friend. “Oh ! “You are stupid.
All smart people have a day. Sunday is God’s
day; mamma's is Tuesday.”
Squatter William Manifold, of Camper-
down (Vic.), lately commissioned Walter Withers
to decorate his ballroom wall with paintings of
scenes in the life of three original Ogg, Gog, and
Magog Manifolds, the famous ancestors of William
aforesaid. Mr. Withers has faithfully executed the
task in six chapters, or panels. Panel 1 shows the
landing of the historic land-grabbers at Point
Henry in 1836. They have come from Tasmania,
accompanied by their cows and sheep and other
live stock. Fierce aborigines are stealing towards
the blessed trinity of Manifolds, but they fear not.
Another panel shows them in search of fresh water
and pasturage, and the next work of Withers
deals with the joy of Ogg and Gog upon
discovering that the water of Lake Burrumbete is
fresh. The journeyings onward of the dauntless
brethren and their defeat of the aboriginal enemy
are imaginatively treated by the artist, and then
comes the grand.climax picture—The Homestead
of William Manifold, Esq. This touching story
of those three wayback brethren doesn’t explain
how they came to be possessed of Tasmanian
sheep and cattle in 1836. The family must have
some first parents who didn’t grow in Tassy,
unless they were colored pussons. But the three
brethren of 1836 will do very well for founders.
They helped to “ create” Victoria in a manner of
speaking, by taking possession of a large tract of
country, and stopping there whilst the live stock
multiplied on the soil. Manifold are Thy
mercies, O Lord !

HAVE YOU
A HAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death re.eases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
maybe discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CUHE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not how being cured.

Headaches
Banished
. . BY . .
Chamberlain’s
Stomach and
Liver Tablets
Price, 1/6.
JUST WHAT YOU NEED.
Headache is most often caused by con-
stipation or a torpidity of the liver. When
the bowels are constipated the poisons in the
excreta are absorbed into the system and
cause headache. When the liver is torpid
and fails to perform its functions, the bile is
absorbed into the blood resulting in head-
ache and often in a derangement of the
whole system. Two of Chamberlain’s
Stomach and Liver Tablets taken im-
mediately after supper will correct the dis-
orders of the liver and move the bowels.
This should be followed by one tablet each
day until the bowels become regular.
Sick Headache arises from a disordered
condition of the stomach and a torpid liver.
Take two of Chamberlain’s Stomach and
Liver Tablets; they will cleanse the
stomach and tone up the liver to a healthy
action. Those who are subject to such
attacks usually feel dull, have little or no
appetite, and are constipated the day before
the attack comes on. In such cases the
attack may be warded off by taking three
tablets as soon as these symptoms appear.
NOTE3.— If not able to obtain Chamber-
lain’s Stomach and Liver Tablets locally,
a package will be sent, post paid, npon re-
ceipt of 1/6, or six packets for 8/-, by

GOOD HEALTH
implies freedom from physical
pain and disorder. It means
strength, energy, power; power to
think well, work well, eat well, sleep
well. It means being “ fit,” fit for home
duties, fit for business, fit for pleasure,
fit for everything. It means money—money saved
and money earned. Indigestion destroys good health.
It multiplies worries, breeds disease and fills the doctor’s
F . purse.' Mother Seigel’s Syrup prevents indigestion and
cures it. It cures in Nature’s way, with Nature’s remedies
•—the healing juices of roots and herbs from field and
forest. Its daily use is a guarantee of good digestion,
which is the foundation of good health. Says Mrs.
C. Barndon, 46, Lydia Street, Brunswick, Victoria,
Feb. 27th, 1902: “ For two years I suffered martyrdom
from acute indigestion. I tried many different medicines, but got no
relief until I took Mother Seigel’s Syrup, three bottles of which com-
pletely cured me. I can now sleep well, my appetite is good, and I
can perform my duties with ease." Beware of imitations.

The distinct departure caused by the new
electro-medical treatment practised by the specialists of
the Freeman and Wallace Electro-Medical and Surgical
Institute, Elizabeth and Bathurst Streets, Sydney, whose
advertisement appears on page 31, cannot he more fully
proved than is shown in the voluntary testimony and
practical endorsement of it by many of Sydney’s influen-
tial personages. The treatment has been adopted and
gladly endorsed by leading professional athletes of all
grades in physical competition. In many instances they
attest their success has been due chiefly to this grand
restorative treatment which has made them physically
and mentally perfect. In long standingcases of insomnia,
rheumatism, lumbago, kidney, and bladder disorders,
general debility, dyspepsia, and all stomachic troubles
the treatment is singularly curative.*

••11." : Marguerites !—I remember so many. But only
one seemed to me to blend perfectly the literary creation
of Goethe with the musical complement of Gounod.
That was Christine Nilsson. So favored was she by
Nature for the character that to see and hear her was to
steal by anticipation the lustre from the crown of every
successor. How well I remember, even now, the night I
heard her first ! Oampanini was the Faust, promising a
greatness he was not destined to achieve ; and Trebelli—
almost worthy of her daughter—was Siebel. What a
Siebel ! And Siebel’s legs—Ah 1 All the wealth and
loveliness of London were there that night. For a great
princess from a foreign land had come amongst us ;
beautiful, refined, angelic, as all princesses are —in fairy
tales and illustrated newspapers. And she sat in the
royal box blazing with diamonds, and bowered in
flowers ; and when—oh, how well I remember that !
when the delicate melody of the Jewel Song fell over us,
and every other sound was hushed as when God speaks a
benison on the blest in Heaven, the foreign princess
raised her delicate lace-handkerchief and blew her nose.
" T.D.” : Melb. Argus critic, who seems to have been
changed lately, falls into an absurd error in describing
the Melba voice as it sounded in opera. He says, “ The
excerpts were rich in striking contrasts, calculated to
display the entire gamut of that marvellous ‘white
voice.’" To describe anyone as having the vote blanc so
roundly deprecated by leading teachers, and by Melba’s
Marchesi in particular, is about the severest thing that
any really knowledgable critic would do. A well-
known musical-comedy girl has 11 white voice ” pretty
badly, because she never learned any better, and there is
a galah parrot next door but one to my abode that I
intend to kill for the same reason when the chance pre-
sents itself. A white sound, in vocal parlance, of course,
means the toneless, colorless variety. What the conse-
quential Argus man probably alludes to is the remarkably
girlish quality of Melba’s voice, so eminently suited to
her Marguerite and her Juliet, but she must have laughed
consumedly when she read that unfortunate reference.
Melba’s “ Uncle Bill,” of Janoourt, Victoria, met with a
nasty accident, t’other day, while trying to scramble up
on to his wagon. The horse started off sooner than was
expected, and threw “ Uncle ” on his head, nearly dis-
locating his neck.
Bulletin’s London correspondent: “ Musgrove has
engaged an Australian actress as leading lady for ‘ down
under,’ in the attractive person of Miss Cynthia Brooke.
Her father built and presented a whole theatre to the
town of Maitland (N.S.W.) little thinking that his
daughter might once ‘ star ’ in it. Of Cynthia, London
Daily Telegraph says : ‘ London, unfortunately is
speedily to lose the services of that accomplished actress,'
etc. She ships Dec. 19.”
Pianist Elsie Hall has made big leaps, according to the
musical critic of London Times : “ She has gained not
merely force and a considerable measure of dexterity,
but a remarkable amount of artistic insight and
musicianship.”
A certain Vic. country resident wants to touch Manager
Musgrove for the railway fares of his family to and from
town, owing to the postponement of a Melba concert.
He has already secured a refund of the concert money,
but does not think that enough. He the railway-fares,
Musgrove wrote :—“ Dear Sir.—l Went to London to see
the Coronation. It was postponed in consequence of the
illness of the King. When the British Govt, refunds me
my passag;e-money I shall be glad to send you the amount
Of your railway-fares.”
Miss Em. Dyason, of Bendigo, has secured this year’s

A musical comedy looming in the Australian future is
The Singing Girl.” How brilliant are the inventive
powers of these modern litterateurs 1 There’s the
“Circus Girl,” the “ Casino Girl,” the “Runaway Girl,”
and now the “Singing Girl,”all following, at a respectful
distance, the “ Gaiety Girl ” and the “ Shop Girl.” And
the “Runaway Girl” gave the cue for the title of the
forthcoming novelty when she shook her tambourine and
warbled “ I’m only a little singing girl.”
They say that quite a goodly number of people in the
know (and who couldn’t sport 10s. 6d.) went to the
Prince Alfred Hotel, next door to Adelaide Town Hall,
and heard, on the cheap, every song given at Melba’s
concerts. •
Concerning the trouble in court, last week,
between Mr. Purves, K.C., and Chief Justice
Madden :
The trial, by Chief Justice Madden, of Arthur Edward
Lewis Wartman on a charge of criminally assaulting
Ethel May Kraemar at Melbourne, amounts to a positive
scandal. The defence was that the parties had been inti*
mate several times prior to the date of the alleged offence
in prisoner’s own house, where the girl had been in ser-
vice as housemaid. Kraemar, under cross-examination,
admitted that on one other occasion Wartman had been
intimate with her, and that she had not complained.
The simple question for the jury to decide was whether
the girl was a consenting party. Justice Madden summed
up dead against the prisoner. The jury retired, and after
the lapse of an hour and 40 min. came in with the request
that they might be permitted to visit the scene of the
assault. The request was granted, and on returning to
the Court, the Judge pointed out to the jury that under
a section of the amended Crimes Act they could return a
verdict of guilty with mitigating circumstances. “ Such
a verdict,” said His Honor, “ makes a very great differ-
ence in the punishment of the person. Personally I
am unable to point out any circumstances which may be
called mitigating circumstances, but the question is one
entirely for you to determine, and it is proper that your
attention should be called to the section.” The first thing
to be noted about this intimation to the jury is that His
Honor did not make it clear whether he could not in law
point out the mitigating circumstances to the jury, or
whether in his opinion there were no such mitigating cir-
cumstances. In the next place the Judge should have
called the attention of the jury to the section referred to
in his summing-up. Doing it in the way he did, was
tantamount to a hint to the jury that if a verdict of guilty
with mitigating circumstances were returned he would
deal leniently with prisoner. Apart from these points
there is a still more serious objection to the procedure
adopted by Justice Madden. It came out in a heated dis-
cussion with Mr. Purves, prisoner’s counsel, that the
Crown Prosecutor had drawn Judge Madden’s attention
to the section referred to while he was off the bench, and
when the jury was visiting the scene of the alleged assault,
and that he (the Judge) had put the matter to the
jury in the absence of prisoner’s counsel. When
challenged by Mr. Purves, Justice Madden held to the
position that he had done nothing irregular but consented
to state a special case for the Full Court. Having
received from Justice Madden the straight tip the jury
returned with the following verdict: “ Not guilty
altogether, under certain circumstances.” The circum-
stances were set out on a piece of paper which was
handed to the bench. It is safe to say that any
other jiidge on the Vic. bench would have accepted this as
a verdict of not guilty. Justice Madden, however,
pointed out that if the jury believed that the girl had
not resisted as much as she was capable of doing, it was
their duty to return a verdict of not guilty, and he sent
them back to reconsider the question of inadequate
resistance. The jury again retired, and Mr. Purves asked
Justice Madden to preserve the piece of paper on
which the jury had set out the miligating circumstances.
This the Judge refused to do, and tore it up. Mr. Purves
and Justice Madden then engaged in a miserable
wrangle, at the end of which Justice Madden ordered
the Sheriff to put Mr. Purves out of the court. Mr.
Purves sat down, and the Sheriff did not put him out.
A few minutes afterwards the jury returned with a
verdict of guilty “ with extenuating circumstances.”
Although Justice Madden had consented to state a
special case for the Full Court, and, though (in all human
probability) still smarting under the quarrel with
prisoner’s counsel, he at once proceeded to sentence the
prisoner to eight years’ imprisonment 1 The method
adopted by Justice Madden in getting the verdict
from the jury was highly irregular and scandalous. It is
fortunate that the case is to be reviewed by the Full
Court.

“H.Gr.” : As a visitor from Melbourne—
both ends of the Sydney trams are alike, and it is
impossible to tell at a glance whether one has just
passed you or is about to run over you. Of course,
the position of the rails and the angle of the
connecting-rod determines the direction, but these
indications are not as plain as a distinctive front
and rear. This, I think, is the cause of many of
the numerous Sydney accidents. In Melbourne,
the “dummy ” indicates at once the direction of
the car. I fancy that'a red disc on the front of
every Sydney car would reduce fatalities 50 per
cent.
Shaftesbury Reformatory, South Head,

Retreat, should serve better as a place in which to
reform the chronic drunkard than as a home for
the 22 State-parented little girls who now acquire
a knowledge of house-keeping and rheumatism
there. The building was at one time a much-
frequented pub. Premier Parkes surrounded the
bar and parlor with stone cells, barred windows,
and iron doors, which was his idea of safe-guarding
a handful of little girls (5 to 15 years), guilty of
petty thefts or other slight offences.

Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l an< writing to tell you
about, the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest,, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week! I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus —as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son

THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHINO MORE COULD BE

CURED BY HEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows: —“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do —send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
t.he night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
soughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily' improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely,

KWTNOWS POWDER
Doctors Prescribe it.
“ Knock, Ennis, co. Clare, Ireland,
“ 10th May, 1902.
“ Sirs. —Having recently got from you
a bottle of Kutnow’s Powder .... from
which I personally derived much benefit,
will you now kindly send me a larger
supply ... as I really feel unsatisfied
without it myself, and I have recom-
mended it to several lady patients, who
approve of it greatly. An aged clergy-
man to whom I recommended Kutnow’s
Powder tells me ‘ He finds it both effec-
tive and agreeable.’ —Yours faithfully,
“J. BOND SULLIVAN,
“ M.D., M.B.C.S. Eng., &c.”
“ Birmingham Medical College,
“ Feb. 13, 1901.
Gentlemen,—l have tried Kutnow’s
Powder, and am pleased to say that the
results have been very satisfactory. I
have been a sufferer for the last two
years with chronic Lithemia [an excess of
uric acid in the blood], and have been
greatly improved since I began the use of
Kutnow’s Powder. I have prescribed it
freely and shall continue to do so.”
Note.—The explanation in brackets is ours.
Sickness Eradicated by it.
«
We do not claim that it is a cure-all, from house-
maid’s knee to impecuniosity ! But we will define what
KUTNOW’S POWDER will do:
FIRSTLY It will clear and expel every atom of poisonous and
putrefying matter which constipation and other irregularities have
stored up in the bowels. It will accomplish this gently, painlessly, and
without griping.
SECONDLY It will prove highly beneficial in liver and kidney
troubles, entirely removing biliousness and bladder derangements.
THIRDLY. It will brace up the nerves, banish headache and
insomnia, prevent despondency, and invigorate the whole system.
BEWARE OF FRAUDULENT IMITATIONS.
Kutnow’s Powder can be obtained in capsuled bottles
from all Chemists and Medicine Vendors. See that the Registered
Trade Mark, “ Hirschensprung ” (or Deer Leap), and the autograph
facsimile signature, “S. KUTNOW and Co. (Ld.),” are on the label
and carton. ONLY SUCH ENSURE GENUINENESS. INSIST
ON “ KUTNOW’S,” AND FIRMLY REFUSE ANY SUBSTI-
TUTES ; THEY ARE WORTHLESS AND Oh TEN INJURIOUS.
Clergy Recommend It.

“Kutnow’s Powder is decidedly the
best remedy of the kind I ever tried for
stomach trouble. It acts like a charm.
I mean to stick to it.
“ D. P. KINGHAM,
“ Rector of Swinford.”

“ Sydenham, S.E.
“Dear Sir—Thank you sincerely for
the bottle of Kutnow’s Powder which I
requested you to send me a short time
ago for the use of my wife, who had been
in the habit of taking all sorts of so-called
‘ fruit salts,’ but which she has now
discarded in favor of your Powder as
she finds it far more beneficial, without,
at the same time, producing the excoriat-
ing effects which she used to experience
from them. I may add that her medical
attendant, a man of considerable practice
in Sydenham, highly approves of her use
of your powder.

If I Were King.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I would build a marble palace by a patch of
golden shore;
I’d hang a reconstructed banker by the golden
door; .. ,
If anyone said “blanky” in all my wade domain
I’d fine him-and I’d hang the miscreant if he
blanked again ; ~
I would build a noble capital beside a river wide;
And white-winged fleets would float upon that
river’s glassy tide,
And beauty, art, and culture to this country
would I bring—
If I were King.
On the pavements of my capital none would
expectorate; . .
I’d suspend the man who did so at the citys
brazen gate; ,
I’d oil the wheels of industry to ease life s toil ancl
fret;
The income-tax I’d double to pay off the Public
Debt;
The civil servant’s wages would be multiplied by
I would send a swift assassin to look up the
Absentee;
And from my palace tower his skull would dangle
on a string—
If I were King.
The arid wastes and deserts I would widely
irrigate , }i , .
(If the person from Kyabram didn t pay ms
water-rate
I would hang him in the morning—in the morning
cool and grey, ~, , . .
And his bones would be a warning at the breaking
of the day).
And he who wrote a drama re a father old and
bent, . . . .
And a daughter who was Lost, likewise a Missing
Document
And a villain with a large cheroot—he d from a
gibbet swing—
If I were King.
I’d abolish lanes and alleys, and I’d purify the
slum; , ,
I would slay the miscreant early who compounded
bogus rum; . , TT -
I would run the country with a single House of
Parliament ; , , . ,
On cool evenings I would slaughter him who
raised the widow’s rent;
The importer man would moulder in a lonesome
winding-sheet;
His bell topper would be jumped upon by beggars
dn the street; T ~
And many sour and cranky preachers I would
bury in the Spring—
If I were King.
My armed minions would go swiftly through the
highways after dark, _
And the Push would lie at day-break m the bye-
ways stiff and stark;
The pigeon-shooting person, and the bookie, and
the pug . ,
Would be slain in secret places by the empire s
Public Thug.
I’d build dwellings for the aged, and the widows,
and the blind ;
The Outcast and the Orphan would in me a father
find; . , ,
And homeless dogs would to me as a friend and
helper cling—
If I were King.
He who toiled at evening up a hill in my imperial
town, .
Might note something like a pumpkin that rushed
past him going down,
And he’d know it was the severed head of the
nefarious gent.
Who lent money to the poor at several hundred
pounds per cent.
And if, when he had breathlessly ascended to the
top, ,
He chanced to find a body lying dead he needn t
stop;
He’d understand it was a sweater, and he d go his
way and sing—
If I were King.
He who sought to borrow money for the develop-
ment
Of our “natural resources” would be in a dungeon
pent.
And the Public Thug would take him who made
Patent Medicine
To the sea, and tie a kedge to him, and firmly
drop him in.
I’d abolish wooden shanties, broken fences, and
the like ;
Likewise the evil-minded cove who scorches on a
bike; ,
Also all things that were smellful, ugly, foul and
mouldering—
If I were King.
The blessed light of Heaven—of sun and moon
and stars—
Should never shine again on him who vended bad
cigars. .
And all who took home liquor, in a bottle or a jug,
Should be bailed up on the highway by the em-
pire’s Public Thug;
If the liquor proved inferior the cash would
be returned,
And the hostelry that sold it to a pile of ashes
burned, . . ,
And the license cast into the tip as an infected
thing—
If I were King.
But at night I hang my crown upon a nail fixed in
the wall; , . ,
And authors would hold revel within my palace
hall;
And bards and sculptors bring the Beer from
underneath the Throne,
While intoxicated artists ’neath the table would
lie prone.
Each man of all that gathering would hold his
jewelled mug
With champagne to be replenished by the glad-
some Public Thug;
And the shouts of the Bohemians would make
tower and turret ring—
If I were King.

Explorations in Civilisation-
BEING THE LETTERS OF AN AUSTRALIAN IN
EXILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
December 7th. —London has some fine hotels and
many, many churches without congregations.
There are also some baths, but these are not
popular; and any man using one in an hotel is
fined 3s. or so for each offence. The worst offenders
are strangers—the natives being very law-abiding
in this respect. .
The most English thing in London is the fog.
Even the etchings in our Chambers, which were
taken furnished, are German. There is one with
silver beeches, a purling stream, and impossible
swans, all very traditionally English, but the
spelling of the title gives it away. When you see
“ A Sylvan Retreat ” spelled “ Sylvian,” you look
forthe imprint of the “ English ” autotype, and
find it is “ Munich.”
There is a shop over the road that occasionally
shows some pictures behind its obscure windows,
that look as if made of smoked glass. One very
haunting thing is a conventional group in a con-
ventional meadow. It is called “ When the
World was Young.” Evidently the types of
woman have changed since then. When the
world was young, a dozen virgins used to dance on
blue grass, and the necks of the virgins were the
necks of matrons, and they had the drop chests
and gooseflesh peculiar to ladies who are emphati-
cally matrons, and their tints were the tints of
new-cut ham.
I have the fierce and generous heat of Australia
in me yet, so I do not feel the cold. My friend,
who has been here longer than I, and so has lost
the Antipodean heat, does feel the winter, and
achieved a cold the other day. Last night we
routed it with “ Euealyptozone,” a saturation of
red-gum sawdust with Eucalyptus Oil, boiled in
water in a kettle witli a long spout. In Australia
we ought to use this in catarrh cases. So soon as
that kettle began to sing and steam, London was
blotted out, and I had the scent of the bush
again in me. I intend to use that kettle when-
ever attacked by nostalgia, which is the only
disease I know personally.
Hie Ship and Turtle, that wondrously expen-
sive lunching-plaee in Leadenhall-st., is my daily
'.tudy. It is at this place you meet the man who
lias a mine to float, and makes all his attempts at
flotation in a half-luxurious way—coming to the
city at 10 in the morning, arguing the beauties of
liis scheme with a son of Judah till 1 o’clock, and
then beginning a lunch at the Ship and Turtle,
and finishing with coffee at half-past 3. By that
time the flog, which had partially lifted at noon
for a few minutes, has returned with reinforce-
inmts, and the city is as obscure as a dumb-
nicger in a cellar at midnight, and “it’s no use
doing anything to-day.”
1 had left my business in the hands of the cir-
cumspect man with a confidence that amounted to
fatuousness, and for two whole days I loafed into
the city, on my legs, or in the “ Tuppeny Tube,”
and opened a few letters languidly, and smoked,
and went to lunch at the Ship and Turtle for
three hours, and then decided that really I must
see the circumspect man to-morrow. On the third
day 1 started out with a whirlwind energy and a
cyclonic enthusiasm that threatened to destroy
any man who opposed my schemes. Through a
friend, I was interested in a big scheme of agri-
cultural development in the tropics, and in his
endeavors to finance this business we met many
people and various. One day he told me he had
met a new man.
“ Another Jew ? ” said I.
“No; an Irishman. Very good fellow. He
asked me to come to lunch some day, and talk
over the business ; but that was too indefinite for
me, so I asked him to have a chop to-day at the
Ship.” ,
We went to the Ship and Turtle at 1 o clock,
and waited at the door of the little bar where the
cheap and hasty man eats his plate of beef stand-
ing up, and where the man you are taking to
lunch says in great haste, “Have a gin and ver-
mouth with me, old man,” so that, later, when he
eats salmon at 3s. a cutlet and turtle soup at
7s. fid. a plate, he can rest easy on the fact that he
has done his duty in the eight-penny matter. You
wouldn’t notice'the charges if your guest were a
friend. But friends rarely enter there.
After a little waiting the Irish guest came
along. In the light of after events I am sorry to
admit that the man was really an Irishman, and
it is only just to say that he was from the “ Black
North.” He had the loud laugh of insincerity
and used it always.
“ Ahrh, me frind,” said he? “ I’ve brought me
two frinds with me.” .
We were all introduced, and went to the dining-
room, and my friend (the host) did not look as
pleased as before.
“ What’s the matter? ” I asked—we were last in
the procession to the table.
‘ ‘ No chance of talking business now, ” he said,
mournfully ; “ I can’t talk to that fellow while
the strangers are present.”
I suggested that the Irishman naa brought Ins
friends in self-defence, but the host frowned and
explained wearily : , .
“ 1 asked him to have a quiet chop and a busi-
ness talk.” . ,
“Well, you’ll have no business talk, but hell
see he gets his quiet chop.”
The Irishman’s friends were hungry—suspici-
ously hungry. They spake no word as the host
handed the menu to the Irishman. He laughed
his loud laugh of jovial insincerity.
“ Pliwell ! phwell! ” he said, “ there s but one
ting to be done, an’ that’s turtle shoup. ’Twould
seem funny coinin’ to the Ship an’ Turtle an’ not
ordherin’turtle shoup.” ,
He laughed again loudly, and I thought he
would order a Ship as well—simply in the in-
terests of the fitness of things.
“We’ll all have turtle shoup, I think, he said,
said he would have just one dish; I
said that I hated turtle soup, w.iich was not quite
true ; but the two friends of the Irishman agreed
very’hastily to have whatever the Irishman had.
“I’ll have a quiet chop with you ” said I (in
quotations) to the host; and he winced. It was
an unkind cut.
We had our lunch —a mere half-crown matter
for the host and myself, but the Irishman and his
two hungry pals followed the turtle soup with
salmon cutlets and curried chicken.
“ Will you have anything else? asked the host
of them in polite tones of agony.
“ Well, now —there might be slium fruit now,
said the Irishman, picking his teeth and laughing
his insincere merriment between picks.
They had some fruit, which here is sold at the
ruling prices of ice in Tophet, and when it was all
over my friend, the host, asked for the bill. Bill
for a lunch ? It was more like a - bill for a trous-
seau, consisting more of pounds than shillings.
When it was paid we went into the fog again,
and on the door step the three hungry men (the
names of two of them we had not rightly heard)
bade us an eternal farewell, the Irishman saying
he was leaving for America the next day and would
be away a year or so. Then he howled out his
false gaiety again and disappeared with his
hungry retainers in the fog. And as we stood
there in the murk that grew thicker and thicker
every minute, my friend, the host, said in the
tones of a man for whom the bitterness of death
is past—“ Well, I’m damned ! ”
Ten minutes after he said, very sternly, that no
friend worth a damn would laugh in such a case,
and, as I continued to laugh, there was a coolness
between us for nearly a quarter of an hour.
Ten Days Later.—Fog thicker; the accursed
holidays coming ; nothing decisive done; and all
tire opportunists we are trying to do business
with, and who are waiting for a boom to bring
them unearned increment, are seizing the fact of
the holidays, and telling us to leave the matter
until the end of January, as they “are going off
to the Riviera.” Going off to the Riviera means,
in the majority of cases, that they are taking a
second-class railway ticket to a fourth-class
boarding-house at Brighton or Hastings. These
boarding-houses are called “ pensions,” because
the boarders live like pensioners—army pensioners
of the rank-and-file.
Early this morning, I came to town to see a
man to whom I had a letter of introduction from
Australia. I had not called on him during my
two months’ residence in England, as 1 had a
stack of introductions and made inquiries before
presenting them, with the result that I decided
to present very few. This particular man, who
had been apprised of my arrival six weeks before,
wrote a sad and impudent letter, reproving me
for not hastening to his footstool, and directing
me to call at once.
I called; and found the difference in the im-
portance of his letter-paper and of his offices
sufficient to justify him in posting his office and
losing it in the mail, and doing business after-
wards in one of his gorgeous envelopes. His office
was in a building that was old when last century
was young. The passage led up 20 smelly break-
neck stairs, into a packing-case, lit by a window
looking on to the usual churchyard. He could not
get out of his office until he closed his desk. I
put half my body into the “office ” and told him
who I was. He asked me what I had to sell.
Told him I wanted working capital for a mine.
“How much ?”
“Ten thousand pounds,” said I, snorting; his
heavy insolent cross-examination was annoying
me. He replied with the grand air every man in
this country gives himself (even if he is buying a
syndicate share in a meat-pie):
“ It’s too small for me. I deal in millions.”
“ Millions of what ? ”
He was annoyed in his turn: “ Millions of
money, sir, pass thro’ my hands every month.”
“ I hope it’s not in notes,” said I.
“Why, sir?”
“ Because you couldn’t find room for any thing
bigger than a cheque in your office.”
He choked a bit, and then he said : “ The stairs
are before you, sir.”
“If you call this precipice a stair, I know
that,” 1 answered back, “I’ve had to stand on the
top rung of the ladder because I couldn’t find room
for two feet in this Bank of England of yours.”
He choked again and I went away happy.
Thence through Lombard-st. and across Cornhill
and Throgmorton-st. to Old Broad-st. and the
Flea-pit to find my circumspect man.
He Was there, and I saw fraud and the light of
the borrower in his eye. So then, this man was
hopeless too.
I asked him to drink and he did, and talked.
“ Your business, sir, is, I may say, complete.
Of course the sum is small--£10,00b; and my
people never touch small things, but I represented
to them that you were a good man, and, as the
Australians have helped the Empire in the war,
they agreed to go in for your mine. But, sir,” he
added with a sudden assumption of the inflexible
Man of Business, of Shylock sharpening his knife
for his pound of flesh, “they want half the mine,
sir, and no less.”
“They shall have it.”
“Then that’s settled.” He finished his whisky.
“But is it settled? How can these people of
yours decide to do business without first seeing my
papers ? ”
“I told them it was all right. Why ! bless you,
sir, they put half a million into Ceylon tea estates
last week, on my bare word.”
“ Humph ! And what are you to get out of it?”
“ The usual thing—half of what you get.”
“ Only half ? Well, it’s too much . . . it’s ridi-
culous.”
“Well, sir—among friends now—how much do
you think ? ”
“ About 5 per cent.”
“Five per cent., sir! Really, you must make
it 10. ”
“Look here. Not five, nor one, nor any pro-
mise, until you take me to your principals. Who
are they ? ”
“ Really, sir, that is a secret.”
“Well, then, we’ll stop business now and here.
Have another drink. . . . Here’s luck. I don’t
believe you have any principals.”
“Sir! sir ! sir! Do you doubt my words. . . .
Well, you know your own business best. Here’s
good health. And, by the way, could you lend
me a pound until to-morrow ? ”
A man I knew beckoned me, and I fled. When
I reached the man I knew, he said : “Say, old
man, how is it that nearly every Australian who
comes here gets into the clutches of that
Blighter ? Cut him dead, old man.”
“ The Blighter ? The Flea-pit ! ” I ran up the
stairs into the fog.
My adventures were not over for the day—they
had just begun. My own exclusive business being
far away from a finish, I put it aside, and went to
see my friend of the other scheme. I found him
talking to a new .Tew. We were introduced, and
talked that big agricultural-products scheme to
death. The new man had a long, flopping upper
lip, the lip of the man who talks much and never
does anything. He was very enthusiastic over the
business.
“Why,” he said, “it ought to be worth
millionth —millionth on millionth.”
“So it ought,” we agreed, trying to keep him
in heart.
“ And in the eourth of a few yearth we might
go inth for meat thupply.”
“So’we might,” we said, although we had no
intention of doing so.
He became so enthusiastic that lie spat fine
spray as he talked.
“It wouldn’t cotht much,” he went on ; “we
could buy a few thouthandth bullockth and cowth
and breed from them.”
We tried not to laugh at the idea of the natural
increase of bullocks and cows, because “the
bullockth and cowth” idea fascinated him so much.
He said, at last:
"IJ.kl 1 y° u what, old chap, we’ll go over to
the Ship and haveth a chop an’ talk over the
matterth.”
We went; and it was just the programme of
yesterday. We had the chops, and the enthusiast
had turtle soup, or, as he called it, “ turtle-
thoupth, ” and salmon and roast chicken, and some
claret with a French label, which I do swear was
a broken-down Australian wine. I did not laugh
when he left us ; it was becoming too serious.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The methods of the seci’et inquiry into
the management of the S’African war may be
judged of by the fact that Kitchener was not
called upon to give evidence until almost the last
moment before he left for Egypt, and that his
examination only occupied a single afternoon’s
sitting.
N.S.W. Land Appeal Court lately forfeited
the additional conditional purchase of a man who
broke his residence conditions by going to S’Africa
“to fight for the Empire” —holding that he
couldn’t qualify for his own farm by helping to
steal the Boer’s. Times are changed.
“A good and true story,” writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, “re the
limpet-like loyalty of the born and bred British-
ling—i.e., little Britisher. An advertising M.P.
invited 30,000 school children to Alexandra
Palace, in order that on buns and beer (ginger)
they might fittingly celebrate the Coronation. To
each he gave a ‘ beautiful’ Coronation medal as a
souvenir of an event that should live for life in
their memories. Nowthe M.P. is limpand shocked,
for on the periodical opening of the automatic
machines medals, medals, and more medals roll
forth. The b. and b. B. lias bartered its loyalty
for a mess of butter-scotch, chocolate, cigarettes,
&c.”

it,
The following case of Mr. Elliott Watkins, of Lady Robinson’s
Beach, Rockdale, is a fitting illustration of the wonderful efficacy
of Bile Beans in curing the most severe cases of Indigestion and
Biliousness. This gentleman says :—“ For a period of over four
years I was a sufferer from Indigestion and Biliousness, the
symptoms which troubled me most being a dizziness in the head,
accompanied by a languid feeling, and a most perpetual and
intolerable headache. My stomach was distended after eating>
and violent gnawing pains attacked me in the chest, breathing
being at times most distressing. I was also greatly troubled
by fits of vomiting, when I would be utterly prostrated and
temporarily deprived of sight for a period extending over hours.
I consulted several doctors, who prescribed for me, without
giving more than temporary relief. At the solicitation of a
friend I tried Bile Beans, though I did not anticipate any
good resulting. To my surprise, the first box gave relief,
and after a month or so, Bile Beans did for a few shillings
what doctors failed to do for many pounds during many
months of trial. I give this testimony most freely and
gladly, hoping that others who know me may be induced,
should they lie attacked in a similar manner to myself, to give
Bile Beans a trial.”
BILE BEANS are an undoubted specific for BILIOUSNESS, INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, PILES,
BAD BLOOD, PIMPLES, AND ALL SKIN ERUPTIONS, BAD BREATH, FEMALE WEAKNESSES, FLL-
NESS AFTER EATING, NERVOUSNESS, INSOMNIA, ANAEMIA, SUMMER FAG, &c., &c. Bile Beans are

Ere yet the lamps are lit
Within our cosy room,
Let’s chat, dear, as we sit—
Ah, comfortable gloom !
Old wife, though long we’re wed,
We’ll not old oaths unsay.
How soon the time has sped !
Five weeks ago to-day.
They said that we should soon
Grow weary (you and I !)
The glowing honeymoon
Wear down our ecstasy.
Wisdom is for the few—
For you, let’s say, and me ;
Those prophets little knew
Our peerless constancy.
Passion is (for my part)
Not yet entirely cool.
You find me still, sweetheart,
A tolerable fool ?
You do? I thought so, Lil.
Though pulses slack of late,
We toddle down life’s hill
Blessing the married state.
Ere yet the lamps are lit
In our so cosy room,
We still can coo a bit . . .
Ah, comfortable gloom !

Her China Dog!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The hammock swung to and fro, carrying its
little burden with a musical swish against the
creepers that trailed over the sides of the broad
verandah, whilst the man near by kept time to its
rhythmic motion with the slow, thoughtful puffing
of his pipe. Presently he smothered the ashes in
its bowl, and, putting it in his pocket, an uncon-
scious sigh escaped him. His companion laughed
merrily.
“You are thoughtful to-night, Graham. In
what direction does your imagination take you ? ”
The man laughed shortly, straining his eyes to
catch a glimpse of her face in the semi-darkness.
“ I was wondering if you were ever in love.”
Again the woman laughed, but he fancied it
sounded a trifle forced as she replied, “What a
question to ask anyone who is married ! Were
you ? ”
“Once,” he said, softly, laying his hand on the
hammock rope, and rocking it lightly.
“Only once, Graham?” she said, quizzlngly,
steering over what she felt to be dangerous
ground. “Surely, oftener ! Tell me about some
of ‘ the other times.’ ”
“You will laugh at me, I’m afraid,” he said;
“but I’m going to risk your ridicule, and confess to
you. Curiously enough,” he added, reflectively,
“the only women I have ever felt I could have
loved have all been married ones ? Why is it, I
wonler, Mrs. Clephane?”
“That is rather a hard question to answer,”
she said, laughing constrainedly, “but I think I
know the reason. It is the unattainable that
always attracts you, and I’m afraid many of your
failures have resulted from this queer little kink
in your character.”
“Thank you, ” he said, a trifle wearily, “You
answered me very ably; but don’t you think
misfortune has something to do with it, and that
there are some poor beggars who are always ‘ a day
too late for the fair’ ? ’’
Mrs. Clephane laughed again. “ I’ve positively
hopes of you, Graham. Your chronic pessimism
is, to some extent, dissipating ; but really, I
abominate puns.”
“There was no pun intended. You always
pick a fellow up so, especially if he doesn’t happen
to be over-brilliant.”
“That’s where my chief charm lies,” said Mrs.
Clephane, banteringly. “Yours is in your gruff,
outspoken way. I quite love you for it some-
times.”
“Do you really mean that? You told me I
was blundering and outspoken, and I can’t help
telling y-ou that you are the cause of my ‘ only
love ’ episode. ”
Mrs. Clephane swung herself into a sitting posi-
tion : “Graham, if I didn’t know you were a—a
gentleman, I would think you wished to insult me.
Considering the difference of our social positions,
you are treating me—like one of my husband’s
barmaids.”
“ Our social positions ! ” he echoed, “What-
ever your husband is, you at least are a lady.”
“Thank you,” she said, coldly; “ I would be
glad if you would treat me as such. Still, 1 must
refuse to be exalted to my husband’s disadvan-
tage, for he is everything to me.”
Her voice quivered with anger, which died out
almost at once, and she added : “Graham, you
are leaving here to-morrow for England, and I
don’t suppose we shall ever meet again, so we will
be friends. You must go now, though. I—you
—that is, I feel so miserable.”
A little sob escaped her lips, and Graham knew
the inevitable tears accompanied it.
“What a brute I am to hurt you so ! ” he said,
contritely. “But I couldn’t help telling you.
Will you forgive me ? ”
“ Yes ! ” she said, tensely ; “ but you must go
now. Jack is coming. Good-bye ! ”
She heard the two men meet in the passage,
and then knew they would have a parting drink
together. As their footsteps died away she
pressed her hands over her eyes and cried bitterly.
In a few brief moments the panorama of her past
life extended itself, and she saw it in all its
cruelty. First, her coming to the Golden West
of Australia with a loving but thriftless father,
who had dissipated one fortune and was seeking
another. Then poverty—not the genteel sort, but
actual want. Then meeting Jack, who had eased
her father’s last days with the comforts his wealth
procured. Then her marriage with him in return
for all his kindnesses; partly, too, from sheer
desperation at being left alone, without friends,
without money. The long weary struggle to be
contented amidst vulgarity and wealth —and she
moaned. If he were only cruel she could have
left him without a pang, but he was so good to
her. And Graham—n»M;spoken, handsome Gra-
ham—how willingly she would have gone with
him !
She did not hear the step beside her, and, only
awoke into consciousness as Jack struck a match
and held it over her tear-strained agonised face.
The match dropped and left them in darkness.
He groped to the seat Graham had left, and
placed his clumsy hand on the same hammoclc-
rope and tilted it aimlessly. His dull brain had
as yet only partly taken in all that the past few
weeks and the present moment revealed.
“Madge,” he said at length, with almost a sob,
“you are fond of him.”
She struggled to answer, but the words would
not come.
‘I I don’t blame you,”' he said in a hopeless tone.
“I’m such a different, rough sort of cove to what
should have had you. Hut I can’t help you,
girlie, it’s too late; and I didn’t have the sense to
see it three years ago. But you needn’t stay
here, Madge, you can go back to your own folk
in England ; and it doesn’t matter that they aren’t
very rich, I’ve got enough for us all, and will
see
She sprang out of the hammock wildly and
threw herself on his knees.
“Jack, Jack, don’t talk like that!” she sobbed.
“ Why not ?” he said uneasily.
Her hand went up and stroked his coarse
moustache softly. “ Because you are . Jack,
what do I prize most of all my treasures ?”
“ Your old china dog,” he answered, likea child
repeating a lesson.
“Yes; my doggie,” she said, in a voice growing
firmer. “It has so many dear, childish associ-
ations. When I was little I thought it the most
beautiful thing in the world. Soon I found others
didn’t appreciate it so much—and I wanted some-
thing grander. I got it, but it broke, and I knew
then that these fine things were not so lasting;
and I loved that old china dog again. For a few
moments to night I had a similar childish longing
for someone the world set more store by ; but it is
all gone, Jack, now you are with me, and I know
I love my old doggie bettor than anything else.”
“My God, Madge!” he blurted out, “do you
mean it ?”
“ Yes,” she answered, kissing his moustache
again and again, and lying bravely.

Insurance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I left my smart dog-cart at the slip-rails—our
Society makes a point of style—and, going round
to the back of the comfortable-looking farm house,
knocked at the door. A ruminative man, who
always stroked his nose before he spoke, opened it.
“Mr. Strong?’' I asked. He stroked until he
discovered his identity and said that was his name.
I sing-songed the usual opening formula : “ I have
the honor to represent the Mutual Insurance
Society, and wish to bring under your notice the
advantage of our Cash-Value policies over those
of any other society in Australia.”
“ Come inside, Mister,” he said. We went into
the kitchen and he placed a chair on one side of
the fire for me and one on the other for himself,
kicked a dog lying in front of it, turned out three
fowls that had entered the room with us, sat
down, stroked his nose, and waited. Then I
opened fire. I expatiated on the necessity of
every man insuring. He agreed quite promptly—
for him. Then I mentioned the various forms of
insurance, and dwelt on the charms of each, but
particularly impressed upon him tire benefits to be
obtained from the 20-year endowment policy.
This policy yielded me a greater commission than
any other —but that is a detail.
He seemed interested, and, after a long stroke,
said : “Yes; that’s the one, I think. It looks a
good thing, mister. Would you mind explaining
that one to me carefully. I would have to pay so
much every year for twenty years, wouldn’t I ?
But how if I died before the twenty years was up ?
And how ”
“ Pardon me,” I said. “ You listen to me, and
I will make it all clear to you.” So I sat there
and talked, and explained, and answered ques-
tions for three hours. And he just sat and stroked
his nose, and said he understood, until I thought
I had him strung up to the right pitch, and took
out my proposal-book in a most casual way. Then
I said : “Let me see—what is your full name ? ”
“John—William—Strong,” with a long stroke
between each.
“Very good. And you propose to take a 20-
year endowment policy on the cash-value basis.”
“Oh no, Mister. I didn’t say that. You see,
it’s just like this. My wife’s brother knows a
chap that’s agent for a society. I don’t think it’s
yours, Mister. Its the Provide-for-all Society, or
something like that, anyway. But he don’t ex-
plain things clearly like you. I’ve listened to a
good many of you’s chaps, but none of ’em could
put things as plain*as you. Well, the last time he
was out, the wife persuaded me to fix it up, an’
so I did. The paper they send you—the wife
calls it the policy, I think —come yesterday, but I
couldn’t make head nor tail of it. Neither could
the wife. So I’m much obliged to you, Mister,
for explaining of it to me so plain. I understand
exactly how I stand now.”
“You d——fool!” I said; “why didn’t you
tell me that before'? If you had brought out your
infernal paper at first it would have saved my
time at least.”
He stroked perplexedly for quite half-a-minute.
“ Well, p’raps that would have been better,” he
said.
ESMI.
“L. W.” : In the notes to his literal
translation of the “Arabian Nights,” Richard
Burton affirms again and again that it was the
women who brought about polygamy in the
Orient, and that more than once the poor males
had attempted to reform it off the fa.ce of
Islam, but always unsuccessfully. In Cairo an
organised attempt on the part of the men to get
rid of all but one wife each was broken up by a
series of murders, unutterably horrible in detail,
perpetrated by the polygamous wives. That gay,
but fearful, writer, “Outis,” in Sydney Tele-
graph, seems to have been struck with a fear that
the unattached woman for whom, owing to the
numerical disparity of the sexes, there is no lawful
husband, may use the vote to grab a share in the
person, wealth and charms of the already-married
man. But there’s no such luck. Australian
women are too jealous. The impossibility of a
plurality of wives under a Freetrade system owing
to general poverty is the only thing that makes
this writer fear that the newly-enfranchised lady
voter will go for the Dry-Dog policy. That is the
only good thing that can be said for it it makes
polygamy impossible, and in that respect is just as
useful as drunkenness, highway robbery, and
wooden legs.


Purifies the Blood

Mr. Alexander Johnson, of Bourke,
New South Wales, sends us his photo-
graph and says:
“ For many years I have been en-
gaged in shepherding, stock-droving,
and other occupations so well known
to bushmen. Often the drinking-
water was very bad, and I was ex-
posed to other hardships of bush life.
I found all the men around me using
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, so I tried it. For
cleansing and purifying my blood, and
for giving me new life and energy, I
found it the most wonderful medi-
cine I ever used. I do not seo how
bushmen get along without it. I
advise all who read this to keep a
bottle of this grand medicine on hand
all the time, for it’s a great health
preserver.”
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Perhaps you are not exposed to all the hardships of bush life. Yet you
have probably suffered from impure blood, great debility, nervousness, exhaus-
tion, indigestion, and other evidences of a weakened system. No matter what
your occupation, nor where you live, if you are in need of a Dlood-purifying
medicine and something to build up your nerves, you should certainly take
this grand family medicine.
You will make a great mistake if you try any other Sarsaparilla than
“Ayer’s.” This is the kind that has been making the cures for sixty years.
